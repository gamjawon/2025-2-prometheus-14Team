RESEARCH PAPER Preferential CO Oxidation on Ce-Promoted Pt/ � -Al 2 O 3 Catalysts under H 2 -Rich Atmosphere LIU Huanling 1 , MA Lei 1, *, SHAO Saibing 1,2 , LI Zenghe 2 , WANG Aiqin 1 , HUANG Yanqiang 1 , ZHANG Tao 1,# 1 Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian 116023, Liaoning, China 2 Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing 100029, China Abstract: Preferential CO oxidation (PROX) under hydrogen-rich atmosphere was investigated over Ce-promoted Pt/ -Al 2 O 3 catalysts. The preparation procedures and conditions, including co-deposition-precipitation (CP), sequential deposition-precipitation (SP), and deposition-precipitation temperature, had great impacts on the catalytic activity. Among the catalysts investigated, the Pt-Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 -CP- 80 catalyst prepared by co-deposition-precipitation at 80ºC showed the best catalytic performance with the maximum CO conversion of 85% at 120ºC. The catalysts prepared under different conditions were further characterized by temperature-programmed reduction (H 2 -TPR) and in situ DRIFTS. The promoting role of Ce was clarified. Key words: platinum; cerium; alumina; co-deposition-precipitation; carbon monoxide; preferential oxidation; fuel cell Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) offer highly efficient conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy without polluting the environment. Therefore they are regarded as the most promising fuel cell technology for transport applications. Hydrogen is used as the fuel for these systems and can likely be generated on-board using a reformer, which is accompanied by the formation of a significant amount of CO. A subsequent water–gas shift (WGS) reactor can reduce the amount of CO to 0.5%–1% [1]. However, the anode catalysts of PEMFC, which are operated at relatively low temperatures (80–120ºC), have been demonstrated to be easily poisoned by traces of CO (even around 0.0001%) in the hydrogen rich feed gas. Therefore it is necessary to eliminate the traces of CO in the hydrogen stream with a minimum hy- drogen loss. Out of the available methods, preferential CO oxidation (PROX) seems to be a promising process and has attracted considerable attention [2–8]. In the past, the Pt/Al 2 O 3 catalyst received much attention for this reaction for its good performance at 170–230ºC, but this catalyst cannot meet the PEMFC requirements because of its low catalytic activity at low temperatures (80–120ºC). Many researchers have added non-precious metals to improve its ability to preferentially oxidize CO at low temperatures. Many Pt/Al 2 O 3 catalysts promoted with non-precious metals such as K [9], Fe [10–12], Ni [13], Co [14–16], and Ce [17–18] showed better perform- ance than the Pt/Al 2 O 3 catalyst. Ceria has been widely studied as a promoter and a reducible support [7,17–25]. It is an excellent oxygen storing and re- leasing component in three-way catalysts and is beneficial for the promotion of the water–gas shift activity [19]. It can also provide lattice oxygen and inhibit noble metal sintering [20]. However, the effect of ceria as an additive to promote Pt/Al 2 O 3 catalysts for the PROX reaction is not clear until now, and the catalyst activity is not high [16–18]. According to the litera- ture, chlorine poisoning may be one of the reasons for the decline of activity for the ceria-promoted Pt/Al 2 O 3 catalysts [21–24]. In addition, the preparation methods play a key role in the catalytic performance of these catalysts [4,7]. In this study, we used H 2 PtCl 6 as the platinum precursor and Ce(NO 3 ) 3 as the Ce precursor to prepare Pt-Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 cata- lysts by the co-deposition-precipitation (CP) method and the sequential deposition-precipitation (SP) method. The catalysts prepared under different conditions were further characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed reduc- LIU Huanling et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2007, 28(12): 1077–1082 tion (H 2 -TPR), and in situ diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS), and the promoting role of Ce was clarified. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation The Al 2 O 3 support was calcined at 650ºC in air for 4 h. An aqueous solution of H 2 PtCl 6 ·6H 2 O was used as the Pt precursor, and Ce(NO 3 ) 3 ·6H 2 O was used as the Ce precursor. Two methods of the catalyst preparation, SP and CP, were used in this work. For the SP method, Pt/ -Al 2 O 3 and Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 were pre- pared by a deposition-precipitation method according to the literature [7]. One gram of -Al 2 O 3 power was dispersed in 150 ml aqueous H 2 PtCl 6 or Ce(NO 3 ) 3 solution. The loadings of Pt and Ce were 0.9 wt% and 2.5 wt%, respectively, with respect to the weight of the support. The pH was adjusted to 8.5 using an aqueous solution of 0.1 mol/L NaOH. The suspension was stirred at 80ºC for 1 h and it was then filtered, washed several times with deionized water, dried at 100ºC overnight, and finally calcined at 400ºC for 2 h. The prepared Pt/ -Al 2 O 3 or Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 was then dispersed in Ce(NO 3 ) 3 or H 2 PtCl 6 aqueous solution, respectively, to obtain Ce/Pt/ -Al 2 O 3 -SP or Pt/Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 -SP catalysts according to the above procedure. For the CP method, 1.0 g -Al 2 O 3 power was dispersed in 150 ml mixed solution of H 2 PtCl 6 and Ce(NO 3 ) 3 , the pH of which was adjusted to 8.5 using an aqueous solution of 0.1 mol/L NaOH. The suspension was stirred at 30, 60, or 80ºC for 1 h and it was then filtered, washed several times with deion- ized water, dried at 100ºC overnight, and finally calcined at 400ºC for 2 h. The catalysts obtained with precipitation tem- peratures of 30, 60, and 80ºC were denoted Pt-Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 - CP-30, Pt-Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 -CP-60, and Pt-Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 -CP-80, re- spectively. 1.2 Catalytic activity measurement Catalytic activity tests were carried out in a fixed-bed flow reactor at atmospheric pressure using 0.1 g of the catalysts diluted in quartz sand at a total flow rate of 67 ml/min (STP, GHSV = 40 L/(g·h)). The catalysts were in situ reduced with hydrogen at 400ºC for 0.5 h in the reactor just before the ac- tivity test. The reaction flow contained 1% CO, 1% O 2 , 40% H 2 , and He balance. The effluent gas was analyzed using an online gas chromatograph (Agilent GC-8800) system equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Only CO 2 and H 2 O were detected as products. Methane did not appear over any catalyst in the whole temperature range. The activity was evaluated on the basis of CO and O 2 conversions. The selectivity towards CO was defined as the ratio of O 2 consumption for CO oxida- tion to total O 2 consumption. 1.3 Catalyst characterization Elemental analysis was performed by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) using an IRIS Intrepid II XSP instrument to determine the Pt and Ce loadings of the catalysts. The specific surface area of the catalysts was measured by N 2 adsorption at –196ºC using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 apparatus. Prior to each measurement, the samples were evacuated at 350ºC for 4 h. XRD patterns were obtained using a PANalytical X’pert Pro Super instrument equipped with an online computer at room temperature. Cu K . radiation was used at 40 kV tube voltage and 40 mA tube current. The scan range was 2 = 20°–80°, and the scan rate was 5°/min. H 2 -TPR experiments were carried out on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 automated catalyst characterization system. A 0.15 g sample was loaded into a U-shape quartz reactor and pretreated with air at 400ºC for 1 h to remove possible con- taminating species. After cooling to room temperature in air, the gas flow was switched to 10% H 2 /Ar, and the catalyst was heated to 600ºC at a heating rate of 10ºC/min. The amount of H 2 consumed was monitored by TCD. A cold trap filled with a mixture of isopropanol and liquid nitrogen was placed in the gas line upstream of the TCD to remove the water. DRIFTS measurements were performed using a Bruker Equinox 55 spectrometer operating at a resolution of 4 cm –1 . Prior to each experiment, the powder catalyst samples (0.03 g) were pretreated in situ according to the activation protocols described for the activity test. The reaction mixture (1% CO, 2% O 2 , 40% H 2 , and He balance) was then introduced at 120ºC at a total flow rate of 100 ml/min (GHSV = 200 L/(g·h)). In- frared (IR) spectra were recorded against a background of the sample at room temperature under 40% H 2 /He flowing at 100 ml/min. 2 Results and Discussion 2.1 Activity test 2.1.1 Influence of preparation methods The influence of preparation methods on the catalytic activ- ity for the PROX reaction is shown in Fig. 1. The addition of a small amount of Ce to the Pt/ -Al 2 O 3 catalyst resulted in a greatly enhanced CO conversion and O 2 conversion (not shown) at all reaction temperatures irrespective of the deposi- tion-precipitation sequence. Among the Ce-promoted Pt/ -Al 2 O 3 catalysts, Pt-Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 -CP exhibited the largest shift of the maximum CO conversion to a lower temperature. CO conversion reached 85% at 120ºC while it was nearly zero over the Pt/ -Al 2 O 3 catalyst. Moreover, the Pt-Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 -CP catalyst had the highest CO selectivity, which was about 80%, at the maximum CO conversion temperature. The CO conver- LIU Huanling et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2007, 28(12): 1077–1082 sion over the Pt/Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 -SP catalyst reached its maximum at lower temperature than over the Ce/Pt/ -Al 2 O 3 -SP catalyst. The maximum CO conversion temperature followed the order Pt-Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 -CP < Pt/Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 -SP < Ce/Pt/ -Al 2 O 3 -SP < Pt/ -Al 2 O 3 . 2.1.2 Influence of deposition-precipitation temperature The influence of the deposition-precipitation temperature was also examined. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the CO conversion increased, and the maximum CO conversion temperature shifted towards lower temperatures with the increase in the deposition-precipitation temperature. The catalyst deposited– precipitated at 80ºC gave the maximum CO conversion of 85% at a reaction temperature of 120ºC, whereas the catalyst pre- cipitated at 30ºC gave the maximum CO conversion of 70% at a reaction temperature of 180ºC. It is safe to conclude that the deposition-precipitation temperature plays a key role in the catalytic activity of the catalysts prepared by the CP methods. A high deposition-precipitation temperature is necessary to obtain a highly active catalyst for PROX at low temperatures. This is possibly due to the strong interaction between Pt and ceria formed by a redox process between Pt 4+ and Ce 3+ , which can effectively occur at above 80ºC in the basic solution [24]. The strong interaction highly improves CO conversion and O 2 selectivity towards CO 2 at low temperatures. 2.2 Catalyst characterization 2.2.1 Physico–chemical properties The physico–chemical properties of the three ceria-promoted Pt/ -Al 2 O 3 catalysts are listed in Table 1. The BET surface areas of the catalysts calculated from N 2 adsorp- tion isotherms were almost the same. For the catalyst prepared by the CP method, the Pt and Ce loadings were 0.84% and 2.28%, respectively, which were basically identical with the nominal values, indicating a high loading efficiency by the CP method. The SP method had a relatively low loading efficiency. The Pt loadings were both 0.82% on the catalysts prepared by the SP method. XRD measurements were carried out to determine the structure of Pt and Ce and the particle size. As shown in Fig. 3, Fig. 2 CO conversion and selectivity for CO on catalysts prepared at different deposition-precipitation temperatures (1) Pt-Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 -CP-30, (2) Pt-Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 -CP-60, (3) Pt-Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 -CP-80 (The numbers after CP mean the deposition-precipitation temperatures Feed gas: 1% CO, 1% O 2 , 40% H 2 , and He balance, GHSV = 40 L/(g·h).)

LIU Huanling et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2007, 28(12): 1077–1082 neither PtO 2 nor Pt phase was detected regardless of the preparation method. The absence of a metallic Pt phase in the XRD patterns suggests that the Pt particle size on the catalysts is too small to be detected by XRD due to the low Pt loading [2,18]. Fig. 3 XRD patterns of different catalysts (1) Pt/ -Al 2 O 3 , (2) Pt-Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 -CP-80, (3) Pt/Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 -SP-80, (4) Ce/Pt/ -Al 2 O 3 -SP-80 2.2.2 H 2 -TPR characterization Fig. 4 shows the TPR profiles of Pt/ -Al 2 O 3 , Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 , and Ce-promoted Pt/ -Al 2 O 3 catalysts. The Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 catalyst exhibited a broad reduction peak around 380ºC, which was assigned to the reduction of the surface ceria [7,24,25]. For the Ce/Pt/ -Al 2 O 3 -SP catalyst, the reduction peak started at about 200ºC. A slightly combined contribution of Pt and ceria was observed [2,7,25]. On the Pt/Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 -SP catalyst, the in- teraction of Pt and ceria seemed stronger than that on Ce/Pt/ -Al 2 O 3 -SP-80, since the first reduction peak of Pt/Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 -SP was at 145ºC. Furthermore, the reduction peaks of the Pt-Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 -CP catalyst appeared at the lowest temperature. The first reduction peak of Pt-Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 -CP was at around 82ºC, which may be associated with the strong metal–metal oxide interaction between Pt and ceria caused by reaction of Pt 4+ and Ce 3+ in the basic solution [24,26,27]. The strong metal–metal oxide interaction induced the formation of oxygen vacancies in the oxide at low temperatures and thus favored low-temperature CO oxidation. Fig. 5 shows the TPR profiles of Pt-Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 -CP catalysts deposited–precipitated at different temperatures. With in- creasing temperature the reduction peaks shifted to lower temperatures. The Pt-Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 -CP-30 catalyst had only a broad reduction peak at around 300ºC. A new reduction peak at around 200ºC appeared on the TPR profile of the Pt-Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 -CP-60 catalyst. The Pt-Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 -CP-80 catalyst had another new reduction peak at 82ºC. This further proved the mechanism described previously that strong metal–metal oxide interaction occurred during the redox process, in which Ce 3+ was oxidized to form Ce 4+ coupled with reduction of Pt 4+ to Pt 0 in NaOH solution. Moreover, the redox process can only effectively proceed above 80ºC in the NaOH water solution and induced oxygen vacancy formation in the oxide at low temperatures [24]. The species that can be reduced at 82ºC on the catalysts precipitated at 80ºC have direct con- tribution to the good performance of catalysts at low tem- peratures [24,26,27].

According to the literature [10,15,19,27], the dual peaks at 2363 and 2343 cm –1 were assigned to CO 2 in the gas phase, the band around 2063 cm –1 and the shoulder at 2085 cm –1 were due to CO linearly adsorbed on Pt 0 atoms, and the 1826 cm –1 band was assigned to bridged adsorption of CO on platinum. Comparing four profiles in Fig. 6 it is clear that for the Pt-Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 -CP-30 and Ce/Pt/ -Al 2 O 3 -SP-80 cata- lysts, similar DRIFTS spectra were obtained with no CO ad- sorbed on Pt particles, which indicates that ceria completely covered the Pt particles [10,15]. Combined with the results of the catalytic activity measurements (Figs. 1 and 2) and H 2 -TPR (Figs. 3 and 4), these two catalysts have similar catalytic per- formance and TPR profiles. In addition, the two catalysts had the same color as ceria. Accordingly, large amounts of Pt par- ticles on these catalysts were covered by ceria particles, which resulted in no CO being adsorbed on Pt particles (absence of bands at 2063 and 1826 cm –1 ). In addition, the CO 2 gas phase was not found in these two in situ DRIFTS profiles, which corresponds well with the activity test results. For Pt-Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 -CP-30, the in situ DRIFTS spectrum further proved that the redox process of Pt 4+ and Ce 3+ cannot effec- tively proceed at 30ºC in basic solution [24].Without the strong interaction, platinum hydroxide was deposited on the alumina support prior to cerium hydroxide. This resulted in an identical structure with the Ce/Pt/ -Al 2 O 3 -SP-80 catalyst, in which platinum was precipitated on alumina prior to cerium. For the Pt/Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 -SP-80 and Pt-Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 -CP-80 catalysts, CO is strongly adsorbed on Pt particles (the bands at 2063 and 1826 cm –1 ), which indicates that most Pt particles are not covered by the ceria. CO uptakes over Pt-Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 - CP-80 are higher than that over Pt/Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 -SP-80 (com- paring the bands at 2063 and 1826 cm –1 ). The CO 2 gas phase over the Pt-Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 -CP-80 catalyst is also higher, which corresponds well with the activity test results. In addition, CO is not adsorbed or weakly adsorbed on Ce 3+ or Ce 4+ . As a result, Pt particles play an important role in CO adsorption and oxi- dation. Ceria located adjacent to Pt particles play a key role to adsorb and activate O 2 . The spillover effect of oxygen was believed to account for the cooperative interaction between Pt and ceria particles and promote the CO oxidation at low tem- peratures [10,15]. These in situ DRIFTS results further prove that the redox process between Pt 4+ and Ce 3+ can proceed in basic solution at high temperatures (above 80ºC), which effec- tively drives the reaction of Pt and ceria to form a strong metal–metal oxide interaction [24]. This strong interaction promotes the reduction of surface oxygen to oxygen vacancies in the ceria, improves the spillover effect, and further promotes CO oxidation at low temperature. 3 Conclusions The co-deposition-precipitation method is efficient in pre- paring highly active Ce-promoted Pt/ -Al 2 O 3 catalysts for PROX. The deposition-precipitation temperature is crucial to yield high activity. Temperature above 80ºC is needed to ef- fectively induce the strong interaction between Pt and ceria. The maximum CO conversion reached 85% at 120ºC for PROX over the Pt-Ce/ -Al 2 O 3 -CP-80 catalyst, which is much better than that over the Pt/ -Al 2 O 3 catalyst. Metallic Pt parti- cles on the Ce-promoted Pt/ -Al 2 O 3 catalysts are essential for CO adsorption, whereas ceria provides the active oxygen for preferential CO oxidation in H 2 -rich atmosphere.

Tel: +86-411-84379015; Fax: +86-411-84691570 Preferential CO oxidation (PROX) under hydrogen-rich atmosphere was investigated over Ce-promoted Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. The preparation procedures and conditions, including co-deposition-precipitation (CP), sequential deposition-precipitation (SP), and deposition-precipitation temperature, had great impacts on the catalytic activity. Among the catalysts investigated, the Pt-Ce/y-Al2O3-CP- 80 catalyst prepared by co-deposition-precipitation at 80°C showed the best catalytic performance with the maximum CO conversion of 85% at 120°C. The catalysts prepared under different conditions were further characterized by temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and in situ DRIFTS. The promoting role of Ce was clarified.
