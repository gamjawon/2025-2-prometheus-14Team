The role of a nickel hydride species detected by 'H-NMR analysis is discussed. The oligomerization of 1,3-dienes catalyzed by nickel compounds has been extensively studied in past years [ 1 ], and recent attention has mainly focused on the development of selective catalysts [2]. This note deals with the remarkable efficiency of catalysts derived from condensed Ni-vapor in the linear dimerization of 1,3-butadiene and isoprene and with the factors affecting the selectivity in their linear dimerization vs. cyclodimerization. Condensed Ni-vapor has been reported to react with 1,3-butadiene and benzene, promoting, in the presence of triphenylphosphine, the selective cyclodimerization of the diene to 1,5-cyclooctadiene and 4-vinylcyclohexene [3]. We found that the same reaction performed in ethanol instead of benzene affords only linear dimers, (Z)- and (E)-1,3,7-octatriene (I and II) being the main products (ca. 92io). Under the same reaction conditions isoprene is linearly dimerized predominantly to (E)-3,6-dimethyl- and (E)-2,6-dimethyl1,3,7-octatriene (III and IV) (Scheme 1). In a typical experiment nickel metal (0.05 g; 0.8 mmol) was evaporated over 40 min and co-condensed with 1,3-butadiene (16.2 g; 300 mmol) and ethanol (15 ml) by being introduced simultaneously at liquid nitrogen temperature using a glass metal atom reactor [4]. The solid red matrix obtained was warmed to - 70 C, and the resulting red-brown solution was siphoned into a Schlenk tube; further manipulations were done at low temperature. 0304-5102/92/$05.00 0 1992 - Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

Triphenylphosphine (0.2 g; 0.8 inmol) was added, and the mixture was transferred at low temperature to a 50 ml Pyrex Carius tube fitted with a Corning ROOO Teflon tap and stirred at room temperature for 24 h. The oligomerization products were then separated from the reaction mixture by fractiollo distillation and purified by preparative GLC. The repuits obtained in the dimerization of 1,3-butadiene and isoprene are summated in Table 1. 3 1,3-Butadiene was readily dimerized at room temperature in the presence of triphenylphosphine as additional ligand (PPh3 /Ni =1) to give (E)- and (Z)-1,3,7-octatriene, in a ratio of ca. 1:1, as the main products (ca. 9290). After 24 h, starting with ca. 300 mmol of diene, the conversion was 95%. Cyclodimers such as 1,5-cyclooctadiene and 4-vinylcyclohexene, which are the main products of the analogous reaction in benzene, were not detected. When tricyclohexylphosphine (PCy3) was used in place of triphenylphosphine, the E/Z ratio of the 1,3,7-octatriene isomers increased from 1:1 to ca. 3.4:1. In the absence of added tertiary phosphine the reaction afforded a complex mixture of high oligomers, which has not been characterized. The dimerization of isoprene at room temperature in the presence of triphenylphosphine (Ni/PPh3=1) afforded as main products (80/0) (E)-3,6dimethyl-1,3,7-octatriene (III) and (E)-2,6-dimethyl-1,3,7-octatriene (IV) in a ratio of ca. 2:1. Gas chromatographic analysis of the crude reaction products indicated the presence of a smaller amount (ca. 15ss'o) of two other dimers (m/e=136 M+); they show MS patterns very similar to those of III and IV but have not been further characterized. After 24 h, starting from 250 mmol, the conversion was about 809'0. The conversion limit is, however, higher: additional amounts of isoprene or butadiene can be dimerized, and the catalyst remains active for several days. For comparison, some of the most efficient known nickel-based systems for catalytic linear dimerization of butadiene are listed in Table 2. It can be seen that the catalyst derived from Ni atoms rivals those obtained by traditional methods in activity and selectivity. The NiH(BH4) (PCy3)z precursor system, which probably eliminates Cy3PBH3 affording a Ni(PCy3) fragment [6], gives in the presence of MeOH oligomers identical to those obtained using Ni-atom-derived catalysts. The efficiency of the catalyst derived from Ni atoms in the linear dimerization of isoprene is also remarkable, because the oligomerization of isoprene with Ni catalysts generally proceeds with lower selectivity and in lower yield than the dimerization of butadiene [ 7 ]. Catalytic system 1 (in Table 2), for instance, is completely inactive in the dimerization of isoprene [5], while catalyst no. 4, which is one of the most selective systems for the linear dimerization of butadiene, with isoprene affords large quantities of cyclodimers (60O) [2b', 8]. As mentioned above, the analogous reaction performed using condensed Ni-vapor, butadiene and benzene in place of ethanol affords only cyclodimers [3]. To investigate the role of EtOH in the linear dimerizations, we have carried out comparative spectroscopic studies of the nonvolatile reaction products of catalytic runs performed in the presence of PPh3 in EtOH and in benzene. The crude nickel-containing products obtained after removal of volatile materials under vacuum were still catalytically active, but attempts to isolate pure complexes were unsuccessful. Spectroscopic analyses of the samples obtained from dimerization experiments carried out in ethanol suggest that a mixture of nickel species is present. The 'H NMR spectra of such samples showed a multiplet VP, H = 4 Hz) centered at 3 -14.05 ppm (Fig. TABLE 2 Linear dimerization of butadiene using various catalytic precursors Nol Catalyst Butadiene/ Time T Conv.

The hydridic region of the 300 MHz 'H NMR spectrum of the crude Ni complex isolated from catalytic runs. 1), indicative of a nickel hydride, and a typical ethyl resonance pattern (8 1.48 (q), 1.14 (t), 2:3 ratio) which, on irradiation, caused an NOE enhancement of the aromatic resonances of PPh3. We tentatively assign this resonance to an ethoxy group attached to a Ni-PPh3 fragment; unfortunately, there are no 1H NMR data on Ni-ethoxide complexes available for comparison. The infrared spectra showed a very strong band at 1938 cm-1 assigned to v(CO), and the presence of coordinate CO was confirmed by the observation of a resonance at 8 200.9 ppm (d, JP, c = 6.6 Hz) in the 13C NMR spectrum. The CO ligand probably arises from an ethoxy group by a well-known reaction sequence involving (3-elimination of acetaldehyde as the first step, C-H bond cleavage of acetaldehyde, methyl migration and reductive elimination of methane [9]. In the light of these observations, it seems reasonable to assume that the main difference between catalytic runs performed in EtOH and in benzene is the formation of a Ni hydride species in the former solvent. The selectivity of nickel-atom-derived catalysts in ethanol for promoting linear dimerization of 1,3-butadiene and isoprene can be rationalized on this basis*. The diene can insert into the Ni-H bond, a second molecule of diene inserts into the resulting Ni-C bond, and the Ni-H species is regenerated by /3-hydride elimination [ 11 ]. The ability of ethanol to participate in the linear oligomerization of dienes has already been observed in nickel chemistry, although the precise role of ethanol has not been elucidated [ 7 ]. The formation of cyclodimers in benzene, where, in contrast, there is no evidence for a nickel hydride complex, can be explained by assuming an oxidative coupling of two molecules of diene to a Ni(0) species, followed by ring closure of the organic moiety and re-formation of the Ni(0) intermediate [ 12 ]. *'H NMR evidence for a nickel hydride complex has recently been reported for the linear oligomerization of ethene catalyzed by Ni/PPhZCH2C(CF3)Z-OH and supports a nickel hydride mechanism [10]. 6 Acknowledgements This work was undertaken with the support of the research program 'Progetto Finalizzato per la Chimica Fine II', CNR.
