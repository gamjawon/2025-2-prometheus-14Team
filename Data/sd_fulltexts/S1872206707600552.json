RESEARCH PAPER Preparation and Catalytic Performance of Pd Monolithic Catalysts Supported by Y 2 O 3 Washcoat JIN Lingyun, HE Mai, LU Jiqing, JIA Aiping, SU Xiaowen, LUO Mengfei* Zhejiang Key Laboratory for Reactive Chemistry on Solid Surfaces, Institute of Physical Chemistry, Zhejiang Normal University, Jinhua 321004, Zhejiang, China Abstract: A novel Y 2 O 3 washcoat adhered to the cordierite honeycomb was prepared using Y(NO 3 ) 3 as the precursor. The Y 2 O 3 wash- coat is suitable for supported Pd catalysts. Catalytic combustion of toluene and ethyl acetate was conducted as model reactions to evaluate the performance of Pd/Y 2 O 3 catalysts. The catalysts exhibit fairly good catalytic activity and thermal stability. For the catalysts calcined at 500ºC, the T 99 of toluene is 210ºC. The Y 2 O 3 washcoat and the Pd/Y 2 O 3 catalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and H 2 -temperature-programmed reduction. The results show that the washcoat has sufficient adhesion and high adsorption efficiency for active species. For the catalysts calcined at higher tem- peratures (700 and 900ºC), the crystallite size of the active species (PdO) increases, which possibly results in a decline in the catalytic ac- tivity. Key Words: yttria washcoat; cordierite monolithic catalyst; palladium; toluene; ethyl acetate; catalytic combustion Catalytic combustion is a very attractive and widely used way to remove volatile organic compounds (VOCs) because of its simple equipment requirement, low energy consump- tion, high efficiency, and without byproducts such as NO x . It is especially suitable for the elimination of organic exhaust gases of complicated compositions [1,2]. A catalyst with high performance is the key part in the catalytic combustion tech- nique. Monolithic catalysts with honeycomb structure [3,4] were developed in the last decade. For this kind of catalyst, the cordierite honeycomb is usually used as the substrate, and the washcoat is coated on its surface as the second support, then an active species such as Pt, Pd, and Ru [5,6] is depos- ited. The washcoat is the medium for supporting active spe- cies, which plays an important role in these catalysts [7]. At present, Al 2 O 3 is usually used as the second support for the cordierite honeycomb due to its large specific surface area and characteristics that it readily supports metal oxides and noble metals. Because of the poor thermal stability of Al 2 O 3 , promoters such as ZrO 2 , MgO, La 2 O 3 , and CeO 2 [8] are added to improve the performance of the washcoat. However, it is difficult to inhibit the formation of spinel phases (AB 2 O 4 ), which affects the performance of the catalysts [9–11]. There- fore, the improvement or replacement of the Al 2 O 3 washcoat is a concern in industry. In this study, Pd monolithic catalysts supported by a Y 2 O 3 washcoat were prepared. It was found that the Y 2 O 3 washcoat has sufficient adhesion and high adsorption efficiency for the active species H 2 PdCl 4 . Moreover, the catalysts show fairly good catalytic activity and thermal stability, which is favor- able for catalytic combustion of VOCs. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation A commercial cordierite honeycomb (MgO·Al 2 O 3 ·SiO 2 ) with 50 mm in length, 25 mm in width, 40 mm in height, and 31 cells per square centimeter was used as the substrate. The Y 2 O 3 washcoat was prepared as follows. The nominal content of Y 2 O 3 washcoat was 10% relative to the cordierite honeycomb. A solution of yttrium nitrate and citric acid with a molar ratio of 1:1 was prepared, and then the cordierite honeycomb was dipped into the solution. The excess solution in the channel of the cordierite honeycomb was blown off, JIN Lingyun et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2007, 28(7): 635–640 and then the coated substrate was dried at 120ºC in air over- night, followed by calcination at 500ºC for 1 h. This process was repeated twice. After the last impregnation, the coated substrate was calcined at 500ºC for 4 h. The increase in the weight of the coated substrate was 9.7%, indicating that the actual content of Y 2 O 3 washcoat was close to the nominal value. The supported Pd catalysts were prepared by an adsorption method with an aqueous solution of H 2 PdCl 4 (Pd content is 8.85 g/L). The nominal content of Pd was 0.15% relative to the cordierite honeycomb. The substrate-coated Y 2 O 3 wash- coat with a size of 50 mm × 25 mm × 40 mm was dipped into the diluted H 2 PdCl 4 solution and heated in a water bath. When the yellow solution changed to a colorless solution, the cordi- erite honeycomb was taken out, and the excess solution in the channel was blown off. The catalyst was then dried at 120ºC for 1 h and calcined at different temperatures for 4 h. The catalyst was denoted Pd/Y 2 O 3 . 1.2 Catalyst characterization The adhesion of the washcoat on the cordierite honeycomb substrate was assessed through laundering in a KU-200 ultra- sonic bath with a power of 220 W and a frequency of 40 kHz. After the sample was laundered in an aqueous medium under the ultrasonic vibration for 30 min, the sample was dried and weighed, and the weight loss of the Y 2 O 3 washcoat was cal- culated. The adsorption efficiency of the Y 2 O 3 washcoat/substrate for H 2 PdCl 4 was determined by measuring the change in the H 2 PdCl 4 solution concentration by a 722 UV–Vis spectro- photometer in matched quartz cells at λ max = 560 nm. The reduction properties of the catalysts were determined by means of hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H 2 -TPR). Catalyst (100 mg) was placed in a quartz reactor. The reactor was heated from room temperature to 900ºC with a heating rate of 20ºC/min under flowing 5%H 2 -95%N 2 with a total flow rate of 30 ml/min. The amount of H 2 consumption was determined by a gas chromatograph with a TCD detector, which was calibrated by the quantitative reduction of CuO to metallic copper. The surface morphology of the Y 2 O 3 washcoat/substrate and elemental analysis of the Pd/Y 2 O 3 catalysts were exam- ined with a HITACHI S-4800 scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with HORIBA energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) operated at 1 kV. BET surface areas of the samples were determined by the adsorption of N 2 at −196ºC with the Quantachrome Autosorb-1 surface area analyzer. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Phil- ips PW 3040/60 powder diffractometer using Cu K α radiation. The working voltage of the instrument was 40 kV and the current was 40 mA. The intensity data were collected at room temperature at a scan rate of 6º/min. Raman spectra were obtained with a Renishaw RM 1000 confocal microscope. The excitation wavelength was 514.5 nm and the scanning range was 1000–200 cm −1 . 1.3 Activity test Model reactions of the complete combustion of toluene and ethyl acetate were carried out in a fixed-bed reactor (i.d. = 22 mm) to evaluate the catalytic performance of the Pd/Y 2 O 3 catalysts. The catalysts were cut into two cylinders (length = 40 mm, i.d. = 21 mm) and were fixed into a steel tube. A gaseous mixture of toluene or ethyl acetate (4 g/m 3 ) and air was introduced to the cordierite at a space velocity (SV) of 15000 h −1 . The concentration of toluene or ethyl acetate was analyzed by a GC-14C (Shimadzu) equipped with an FID detector. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Structure and component of catalysts Fig. 1 shows the EDX spectrum of the Pd/Y 2 O 3 catalyst calcined at 500ºC. Elements such as Mg, Al, Si, and Ti were detected, which are the components of the cordierite honey- comb substrate. In addition, Y associated with the washcoat and Pd (active species) was detected, indicating that the Y 2 O 3 washcoat and Pd are successfully deposited. Fig. 1 EDX spectrum of Y 2 O 3 washcoated cordierite honeycomb supported Pd catalysts (abbr. to Pd/Y 2 O 3 ) calcined at 500ºC The chemical analysis of the Pd/Y 2 O 3 catalyst calcined at 500ºC by EDX is listed in Table 1. Calculated according to oxides (the sum of MgO, Al 2 O 3 , SiO 2 , and TiO 2 is the cordier- ite honeycomb quantity), the content of Y 2 O 3 and Pd to the substrate are 1.28% and 0.74%, respectively. Noting that the actual values are 9.7% and 0.15%, respectively, it is obvious that the content of Y 2 O 3 determined by EDX is much lower, whereas that of Pd is much higher than the actual content. Because the H 2 PdCl 4 solution is a strong acid (pH = 2–3), Y 2 O 3 could possibly dissolve in the course of Pd impregna- JIN Lingyun et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2007, 28(7): 635–640 tion, so the content of Y in the H 2 PdCl 4 solution after sup- porting Pd was determined by the inductively coupled plasma technique. The result indicates that the dissolved content of Y 2 O 3 is lower than 0.3% (relative to the cordierite honey- comb), suggesting that the loss of Y 2 O 3 is very limited. Therefore, the difference between EDX analysis and actual contents may be because most of Y 2 O 3 enters the channel of the cordierite honeycomb, whereas Pd enriches on the surface. Moreover, EDX is a surface analysis technique, so the content of Y 2 O 3 analyzed by EDX is lower than the actual value, and that of Pd is higher. Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of the substrate and the Y 2 O 3 washcoat/substrate. There are no obvious changes in the sur- face morphology and the channel shape between the substrate and the coated substrate. Although the Y 2 O 3 washcoat was coated, the weight of the washcoat/substrate increases by 9.7%, and the surface morphology hardly changes. Combined with the EDX analysis results (the content of Y 2 O 3 is much lower than the actual value), it further suggests that most of Y 2 O 3 enters the channel of the cordierite honeycomb in the course of coating with Y(NO 3 ) 3 . The Y 2 O 3 washcoat/substrate calcined at 500ºC was used for the test of ultrasonic vibration. The result shows that a weight loss is 3.1%, whereas that of the Al 2 O 3 washcoat is 11.3% [12], demonstrating that the Y 2 O 3 washcoat firmly anchors on the substrate and has better vibration resistance. Therefore, it is highly suitable for monolithic catalysts. The BET surface areas of the cordierite honeycomb and the Y 2 O 3 washcoat/substrate calcined at 500ºC are 0.4 and 3.9 m 2 /g, respectively, indicating that the surface area of the coated substrate slightly increases. The adsorption performance of the Y 2 O 3 washcoat/substrate calcined at 500ºC for H 2 PdCl 4 is shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that the Y 2 O 3 washcoat has a good adsorption efficiency for H 2 PdCl 4 . The color of H 2 PdCl 4 solution completely fades after 22 min, and more than 98% of H 2 PdCl 4 is adsorbed on the surface of the Y 2 O 3 washcoat/substrate. It can be con- cluded that despite the smaller surface area (3.9 m 2 /g, even considering the Y 2 O 3 washcoat alone, the area is only 35 m 2 /g, which is obviously smaller than that of Al 2 O 3 ), the Y 2 O 3 washcoat in the catalysts shows excellent adsorption effi- ciency for H 2 PdCl 4 , which is probably related to the isoelec- tric point (IEP). The IEP value for Y 2 O 3 and Al 2 O 3 are 8.1 and 7.8, respectively. For the same H 2 PdCl 4 solution, there are more positive charges on the Y 2 O 3 surface than that of Al 2 O 3 .

Fig. 3 Adsorption performance for H 2 PdCl 4 of Y 2 O 3 washcoat/cordierite calcined at 500ºC Fig. 4 shows the XRD patterns of the Pd/Y 2 O 3 catalysts calcined at 500 and 900ºC. According to the figure, only peaks associated with the cordierite honeycomb substrate but no other diffraction peaks due to Y 2 O 3 or Pd are observed. This suggests that Y 2 O 3 highly disperses on the surface of the Pd/Y 2 O 3 catalysts, and the content of PdO is too low to be detected. Fig. 4 XRD patterns of Pd/Y 2 O 3 catalysts calcined at different temperatures (1) Cordierite, (2) 500ºC, (3) 900ºC In order to further confirm the phases of the Pd/ Y 2 O 3 cata- lysts, the Raman experiments were carried out and the spectra are shown in Fig. 5. Compared with the Y 2 O 3 wash- coat/substrate, there is no new Raman band for the catalysts calcined at 500 and 700ºC. A strong band at 650 cm –1 ascribed to PdO [13] is observed for the catalysts calcined at 900ºC. This is because PdO sinters and its crystallite size increases when the catalysts are calcined at higher temperature. Com- bined with the XRD results, this indicates that both Y 2 O 3 and PdO highly disperse on the surface of the Pd/Y 2 O 3 catalysts calcined at 500 and 700ºC, and for the catalyst calcined at 900ºC, PdO exists as the crystalline phase. Fig. 5 Raman spectra of Pd/Y 2 O 3 catalysts calcined at different temperatures (1) Y 2 O 3 /cordierite, (2) 500ºC, (3) 700ºC, (4) 900ºC 2.2 H 2 -TPR of Pd/Y 2 O 3 catalysts The H 2 -TPR profiles of Pd/Y 2 O 3 catalysts calcined at dif- ferent temperatures are shown in Fig. 6. For all the catalysts, a reduction peak at low temperature (about 100ºC) is observed. This peak shifts to higher temperature with increasing calci- nation temperature, but the peak area hardly changes. The amount of consumed hydrogen corresponding to the reduction peaks was calculated by calibration with the hydrogen con- sumed in the quantitative reduction of known amounts of CuO. It was found that the actual amount approximates that of PdO reduction, suggesting that the peaks result from the re- duction of PdO on the catalyst surface. The shift of these peaks to higher temperature is related to the increase in crys- Fig. 6 H 2 -TPR profiles of Pd/Y 2 O 3 catalysts calcined at different temperatures (1) Y 2 O 3 /cordierite, (2) 500ºC, (3) 700ºC, (4) 900ºC JIN Lingyun et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2007, 28(7): 635–640 tallite size of PdO for the catalysts calcined at high tempera- ture. For catalytic combustion, PdO is usually regarded as the active species of the catalysts; however, it easily decomposes into Pd. Hence, it is very important for the performance of catalysts to maintain the stability of PdO at high temperatures [14]. From the TPR results, it can be seen that PdO on the Y 2 O 3 washcoating calcined at 900ºC is stable, which may be due to the strong interaction between highly dispersed PdO and the Y 2 O 3 washcoat [15,16]. 2.3 Catalytic combustion of toluene or ethyl acetate Fig. 7 shows the catalytic combustion of toluene and ethyl acetate over the Pd/Y 2 O 3 catalysts calcined at different tem- peratures. For the catalyst calcined at 500ºC, the T 99 (the low- est temperature when the oxidation reaction achieves a con- version of 99%) of toluene and ethyl acetate are 210 and 300ºC, respectively. This implys that the catalyst has high catalytic activity for catalytic combustion of toluene, and for ethyl acetate, the activity is lower. For the catalyst calcined at 900ºC, the T 99 of toluene or ethyl acetate only increases by 20ºC compared with that of the catalyst calcined at 500ºC, suggesting fairly good thermal stability of the catalyst. Be- cause of the strong interaction between highly dispersed PdO and the Y 2 O 3 washcoat [15,16], PdO can still maintain the stability at higher temperature, which may be the main reason for better catalytic activity and thermal stability of the cata- lysts. For catalysts calcined at higher temperature, the decline in the catalytic activity is related to the increase in the crystal- lite size of PdO [17]. 3 Conclusions A novel Y 2 O 3 washcoat adhered to the cordierite honey- comb was prepared using Y(NO 3 ) 3 as the precursor. The Y 2 O 3 washcoat has strong adhesion and high adsorption efficiency for H 2 PdCl 4 . Moreover, the Pd/Y 2 O 3 catalysts supported by the Y 2 O 3 washcoat show fairly good catalytic activity and thermal stability, and they are suitable for VOCs catalytic combustion. The strong interaction between highly dispersed PdO and the Y 2 O 3 washcoat may be the main reason for better catalytic activity and thermal stability of the catalysts. For catalysts calcined at higher temperatures, the crystallite size of PdO increases, which possibly results in a decline of the cata- lytic activity. References [1] Cimino S, Pirone R, Russo G.

        "dc:description": "A novel Y2O3 washcoat adhered to the cordierite honeycomb was prepared using Y(NO3)3 as the precursor. The Y2O3 washcoat is suitable for supported Pd catalysts. Catalytic combustion of toluene and ethyl acetate was conducted as model reactions to evaluate the performance of Pd/Y2O3 catalysts. The catalysts exhibit fairly good catalytic activity and thermal stability. For the catalysts calcined at 500°C, the T99 of toluene is 210°C. The Y2O3 washcoat and the Pd/Y2O3 catalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and H2-temperature-programmed reduction. The results show that the washcoat has sufficient adhesion and high adsorption efficiency for active species. For the catalysts calcined at higher temperatures (700 and 900°C), the crystallite size of the active species (PdO) increases, which possibly results in a decline in the catalytic activity.",
