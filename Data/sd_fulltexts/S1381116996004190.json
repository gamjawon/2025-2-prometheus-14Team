Model compounds of type OsZO6L4 (L = pyridine, 4-iso-propyl pyridine, and 4-ten-butyl pyridine) were obtained under the conditions of the catalyst synthesis. The catalytic systems were successful in the dihydroxylation of alkenes. Keywords: Dihydroxylation; Alkenes; Supported catalyst; Osmium 1. Introduction Although osmium tetroxide is known to catalyze the dihydroxylation of alkenes since the fundamental work of Hofmann, Milas, and Criegee, and in spite of the fact that a wellestablished enantioselective variant is now available, fruitful industrial applications have never been seen [1-4]. Because of its special biological and physical properties (high toxicity and volatility), the handling of osmium tetrox- Corresponding author.

Grafting of osmium tetroxide on a suitable support seems to be a way to come closer towards technical applications. In this context, Cainelli et al. reported the preparation of polymersupported catalysts: OS04 is immobilized on several amine-type polymers [5]. Such catalysts 1 evidently have structures of the type OS04 ~ L, with the N-group of the polymer ( = L) being coordinated to the Lewis acidic osmium center (Fig. 1). Molecular structures of this formula are the monomeric complexes OS04 ~ NR 3 (R = alkyl group) [6]. Based upon this concept, a catalytic enantioselective dihydroxylation was established by using polymers containing cinchona alkaloid derivatives [7]. Independently, we reported the immobiliza- 198 W.A. Herrmann et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 120 (1997) 197-205 O`bs=O 011 O Fig. 1.

In the present contribution, we present evidence for the structure of these systems and report on the catalytic properties in the dihydroxylation of alkenes. 2. Results discussion In sharp contrast to the Cainelli catalyst 1 (Fig. 1), our loaded polymer 2a does not contain osmium(VIII)oxide, but oxidic osmium in a lower oxidation state. Thus, during the formation of the catalyst 2a, the solvent THF serves as a reducing agent. Whilst the Cainelli catalyst 1 does not react with H202 (8% in tert-butanol), 2a yields the catalyst 2b (Scheme 1). The resulting catalytic system 2b shows better and more reproducible results in the dihydroxylation of alkenes than 2a. The Cainelli catalyst 1 decomposes over months when stored in air (color change from yellow to black). As shown by TG-MS data, it eliminates Os04 akeady at room temperature and ambient pressure. Catalysts 2a and 2b do not show any change and do not release Os04 even upon prolonged storage. Moreover, no loss of Os04 is observed in the mass spectrum of catalyst 2b up to 350. oso4 + N Jx (PVP) 2 a HzOz, 24 h~ 2 b Scheme I. Synthesis of polymer-bound osmium oxide catalysts 2a and 2b.

Even after oxidative treatment (H202), the osmium species of the resulting catalyst 2b shows no change in oxidation state. An unequivocal structural assignment was not possible but the following techniques revealed at least general features. 2.1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) This method was administered to possibly determine the oxidation state of osmium present on cross-linked PVP after treatment with osmium tetroxide in THF (2a) and after the oxidative treatment (2b), respectively. Some of the results are shown in Tables 1-3. A single Os compound with an electron binding energy of ca. 55 eV (4f electrons) dominates the spectrum, quite characteristic for hexavalent osmium (e.g., K2[Os02(OH)4], 55.2 eV [9~. In some samples two compounds with similar binding energies (54.8 eV and 55.2 eV) were observed, possibly due to the formation of two different forms of osmium(VI)oxide, e.g. monomeric and dimeric species. This is in line with the electron binding energies of dimeric dioxoosmium(VI)complexes: the energies of W.A. Herrmann et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 120 (1997) 197-205 Table 2 XPS-results of catalyst 2b (BE = binding energy) Signals PVP/4.5% Os BE (eV) (at%) 283.5 284.9 285.4 285.9 286.7 288.1 399.4 400.7 52.9 54.9 c5 N, N, Os, Os, Os3 1.5 11.6 37.3 17.2 7.2 3.3 6.1 1.9 0.08 0.27 PVP/5.1% Os BE (eV) (at%) 284.5 285.0 285.5 286.0 286.5 286.9 288.3 399.5 401.0 52.8 54.8 55.2 8.4 13.6 38.2 18.0 5.4 2.6 2.6 9.4 1.0 0.08 0.27 0.28 dinuclear systems are at about 54.3 eV and therefore up to 1 eV lower as compared to the corresponding mononuclear compounds [ 10]. However, an additional minor Os compound (53 eV) is present all the time; it seems to be osmium(IV)oxide OS02 (52.7 eV [11]). The XPS data of catalyst 2b with additional carbon atom signals at ca. 288 eV (Table 2) indicate the presence of carboxy groups in the polymer. Refluxing of 2a in H20z/tert-butanol dissolves the catalyst completely under decomposition. On heating the starting material PVP under the same conditions none of these observations are made. Thus oxidative treatment in the presence of Os seems to partially degrade the polymer, primarily the CC-backbone. The XPS data are in line with this (Table 3): catalyst 2b exhibits a relative decrease in the backbone signals Ct, whereas the relations of the CZ , 199 C3-, and total N-signals remain roughly unchanged. The second nitrogen signal at ca. 401 eV cannot unambiguously be assigned to an Os-N bond because of the changing Os/N ratio. An authentic sample of poly(4-vinyl pyridine-Noxide) shows a binding energy of 403.3 eV. Therefore, due to the lack of signals in this region, the formation of PVP-N-oxide C8] can be ruled out, even in case of oxidative treatment. 2.2. CP / MAS NMR spectroscopy The '3C CP/MAS spectra of the PVP support are similar to the data of a material obtained by treatment of PVP with OS04 in cyclohexane (1, Fig. 2). When the loading is performed in THF (2a), usually signals of merely adsorbed THF show up at 26.1 and 68.3 ppm. Both the narrow lines and the solid-state NMR characteristics are indicative of adsorption and not of chemical bonding [12]. Additionally, the intensity of the THF signals decreases upon prolonged drying of the material in a vacuum. The aliphatic polymer backbone is easily identified by the chemical shifts. There are two overlapping signals (shoulder of the signal at 41 ppm, Fig. 2). The pyridine rings gave signals at 123 and 151 ppm, with intense first-girder rotational side-bands due to large chemical shift anisotropes [ 13,14] in the conventional 13C CP/MAS spectrum. When a dipolar dephasing delay of 40 As was applied, the signals at 41, Table 3 Ratio of the signals of the support material PVP, PVP stirred in THF, PVP stirred in 8% HZOz in tert-butanol and 2b (mean value) Polymer Atom PVP PVP/THF PVP/Hz02 2b ~ C 2 2 2 2 C2 3.3 3.3 3.3 5.7 C3 2.1 2.1 2.1 2.8 c2 C4 0.02 0.01 0.19 1.1 N 0.9 0.8 0.7 1.4 (N, + NZ) 200 W.A.

Spinning frequency: 4000 Hz. 123, and 151 ppm were substantially reduced in intensity, while a resonance at 154 ppm remains (which had previously been hidden under the broad signal at 151 ppm). On the basis of this experiment, the signal at 154 ppm is assigned to the quaternary carbon atom of the pyridine ring. This is further supported by an increment calculation in analogy to substituted benzenes [15]. For example, para substitution of pyridine with an isopropyl group should lead to a ca. 20 ppm downfld shift of the para carbon (Cy) resonance. The observed signal at 154 ppm is in accord with the calculation (156 ppm). The same agreement is found for the non-quaternary Ca (151 ppm) and C(123 ppm) resonances. The 1 C CP/MAS spectra do not change after treatment with Os04, showing that the latter does not bind to the carbon atoms of the pyridine rings. Binding of Os04 via the nitrogen seems at first glance more likely. As is seen from various examples of pyridinium compounds [ 16], however, the signals of the ring carbon atoms should be shifted substantially to lower frequencies. We therefore conclude that the coverage with Os04 (ca. 5%) is too low in order to provide signals other than those of the support. However, 13C CP/MAS NMR can be successfully used in order to study the fate of the catalyst 2a under the applied conditions. While the support PVP does not change upon treatment with H202/tert-BuOH after being Catalysis A: Chemical 120 (1997) 197-205 loaded with Os04, the support PVP is attacked by this oxidative mixture. The 13C CP/MAS spectrum of 2b displays a number of signals in the region 150-177 ppm (besides the strong resonance at 41 ppm), the most intense signals occurring at 8 = 166 and 177 ppm; these two signals are typical of carboxy groups. The quaternary nature of the corresponding carbons is supported by dipolar dephasing experiments. Hence we conclude in accordance with the aforesaid, that the immobilized catalyst 2a oxidizes not only the substrate but also the support material. Upon oxidative treatment, most of the oxidation-sensitive sites of the polymer are being oxidized. If catalyst 2b is used, this `side reaction' is obviously reduced, resulting in a more reproducible catalytic activity. Moreover, partial cleavage of the polymer backbone could enlarge the numbers of active Os-sites for catalytic interactions, thus increasing the catalytic activity. Interestingly, we were not able to observe the signal at 154 ppm, assigned to the quaternary carbon atom of the pyridine ring, in the dipolar dephasing spectrum. This would indicate that the pyridine ring is attacked by the oxidative treatment as well. Since no additional confirmation for this statement was conveyed by any other analytical results, it is likely that the polymer decomposition proceeds via backbone cleavage. In contrast to 13C CP/MAS, solid-state NMR measurements of 15N in natural abundance are still rare, due to the unfavorable NMR properties of this nucleus [17,18]. Nevertheless, a 15NCP/MAS spectrum of PVP could be obtained. It shows just one resonance at 8 = - 63.2 p~m in the typical range of pyridines [19]. The 5N CP/MAS spectrum of Os04 loaded PVP (2a) is seen in Fig. 3. The signal at 8 = - 64.0 ppm dominates the spectrum. The 8(15N) and also the chemical shift anisotropy [ 13,14] suggest that this signal comes from the support material. Another signal with a very low intensity is also seen. The highest peak has a S-value of -146 ppm, but this is not necessarily the isotropic line. In order to determine whether this signal W.A.

Spinning frequency: 4060 Hz. possibly arises from N-atoms bound to osmium, OS04 ~ py [20] was used as a model. Unfortunately, no 15N solid-state NMR signal could be obtained from it, most probably due to the long 1 H relaxation times of > 60 s. 201 2.3. IR / Kaman spectroscopy Both the IR and Kaman spectra have been generated by subtracting the support polymer spectrum from sample spectra. The diffuse reflectance FTIR (DRIFT) spectra of 2a and 2b show the following major bands in the spectral range between 600 and 1100 cm-': 2a 610 (2b: 606), 650 (655), 676 (688), 849 (842), 1040 (1040), and 1060 (1061) cm-'. These signals are well in accord with the photoacoustic FTIR (PA-IR) and Kaman measurements ('able 4). Due to the complexation of the OS04 there are two different changes in the `surface' species spectra of 2b. The number of bands belonging to the pyridine vibrations at ca. 1065, 1034, 750, and 670 cm-' are shifted as a consequence of the metal-attachment of this molecule. All these bands are active both in the PA-IR and Kaman spectra. The second type of new bands belong to Os-oxide species.

In accord with the DRIFT spectra in the region of Os-O (single bond), stretching bands are found in the PA-IR spectra at 650 and 608 cm-1 as bands of medium and strong intensity. The signals can be assigned to Os202 stretching modes (B2and B3, indicating a dinuclear DZh symmetrical structure. Therefore, we can propose a dinuclear octahedral structure for the surface complex with two traps-oriented oxo ligands and bridging oxygen atoms. Furthermore, a weak feature is observed at 550 and 413 cm-', possibly due to Os-OH stretching modes belonging to a second oxidic Os(VI) structure. Moreover, evidence for the presence of carboxy groups in the polymer after Table 6 Oxidation of olefins using catalyst 2b and catalyst 1 in HZOz/t-BuOH oxidative treatment is obtained by DRIFT (strong bands for 2b at 2600 and 1700 cm-1). Criegee had already described the formation of an osmium(VI) oxide by reduction of Os04 with ethanol in the presence of pyridine [20]. The structure was later determined as Os206(py)4 by X-ray crystallography [21]. This compound shows IR signals at 874 cm-1 (Os02 sym. stretching mode), 842 cm-' (Os02 asym. stretching mode), 596 and 643 cm-1 (Os202 stretching modes) [22]. Comparison of the vibrational frequencies and calculated force constants for O=Os=O groupings in different molecules (Table 5) lead to the following conclusions: (1) Increasing Os0 stretching frequencies lead to greater Os0 force constants. (2) The Os0 bond strength increases with the oxidation state of the metal.

Structure of oxoosmium(VI)pyridine compounds as models for 2a and 26; X = H, tent-butyl, isopropyl. (3) The close values of the Os0 force constants for Os206(py)4 and catalyst 2b indicate the similarity of the two structures. In accord with these results, the reaction of OS04 and THF in the presence of pyridine and its derivatives leads to similar types of complexes (Fig. 4). Even with the influence of an alkyl group in para position (modelling the polymer backbone), the dinuclear Os(VI) structure occurs. These compounds are active as catalysts in the dihydroxylation of alkenes with hydrogen peroxide as the primary oxidant. The addition of ethanol to Os04 and PVP in THF yields 2a according to IR and XPS. Moreover, the addition of ethanol accelerates the process of reduction and fixation significantly. Following the concept of fully avoiding the extremely poisonous Os04, it is suitable to synthesize a catalytic active sample 2c by stirring an aqueous solution of potassium osmate with PVP. As compared with 2a the resulting polymer 2c shows almost identical spectroscopic data (PA-IR, Raman; Table 4) and similar catalytic activity. Again this method is known for the preparation of Os206(py)4 [23]. The activity of the catalyst 2b was tested on a wide range of organic substrates. Some of the results are shown in Table 6. Data from the Cainelli-type catalytic system are given for comparison. The results are in line with those reported previously [8]. However, slightly longer reaction times or higher temperatures were occasionally needed. The yields are throughout lower using catalyst 1 under the same catalytic conditions. Under the applied conditions, catalyst 2b is not active when oxidants other than H 202 were used, e.g. trimethylamine-N-oxide, tent-butyl hydroperoxide, bis-tert-butyl perox- 203 ide, oxygen, or hexacyanoferrate(III). In case of 1, however, the best results were obtained by means of trimethylamine-N-oxide or tert-butyl hydroperoxide [5] - the typical feature of molecular catalysts of types Os04 and Os04 ~ L. 3. Conclusion Our catalyst system of PVP-grafted osmium oxide proves useful in the catalytic dihydroxylation of olefins by means of hydrogen peroxide. It provides oxidic osmium(VI) in a non-volatile form and is conveniently used for laboratory purposes. The catalyst system can be recycled several times although the polymer support (PVP) is slowly attacked under the oxidative conditions. We are afraid that this gradual polymer decomposition will hamper an industrial application. Nevertheless, there is great potential in polymer-supported Os04 catalysts taking into account that - as shown in this paper reduced species (Os\"', OsIV) are still well-suited as active catalyst precursors. 4. Experimental section TXRF (total reflection X-ray fluorescence analysis) measurements (Os analysis) were carried out by Professor Schuster and co-workers on a Atomika XSA-8000 in our institute. Elemental analysis (C, H, N), XPS, and DRIFT measurements were performed in the analytical laboratory of the central research department at Hoechst in Frankfurt. Solid-state-NMR: all spectra were recorded on a Bruker MSL 300 and on a Varian VXR 300 NMR spectrometer, equipped with 7 mm double bearing probeheads. The materials were packed densely in 7 mm Zr02 rotors and cross polarization (CP) [ 13,24], dipolar dephasing [ 13,25], and magic angle spinning (MAS) [ 13] with rotational speeds of 4 to 4.5 kHz were used. 13C CP/MAS: the recycle delay was 4 s, the contact time 5 ms and for the dipolar dephasing experiments a 204 W.A. Herrmann et al./ Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 120 (1997) 197-205 delay of 40 E.cs was applied. The external reference was adamantane ( 8 = 29.47 for the low frequency signal [26]), that was also used for the optimization of the Hartmann-Hahn match. About 500 scans gave spectra with satisfactory signal to noise ratio. 'SN CP/MAS: recycle delays of 1 to 60 s and contact times of 3 to 8 ms were applied. Depending on the sample numbers of scans ranged between 1000 and 53000. The external reference used was solid isNH4isN03, The PA-IR spectra were recorded on a Bio-Rad Digilab Division FTS-65A/896 FTIR spectrometer at 4 cm-1 optical resolution between 4000 and 400 cm-1 using an MTEC 200 photoacoustic detector. The Raman spectra were taken on a Bio-Rad Digilab Division dedicated FT-Raman spectrometer between 3500 and 70 cm-1 at 4 cm-1 optical resolution employing 40 mW energy of a Nd:YAG excitation laser at the sample position. NMR sample tubes with 5 mm diameter were used as sample holders. The number of accumulated scans were 4096. The spectra were processed employing the GRAMS/386-based WIN-IR software applied with the FT-Raman spectrometer. Catalysts 1, 2a and 2b [8], and PVP-N-oxide [27] were prepared according to literature procedures. Poly(4-vinyl pyridine) (2% cross-linked) and potassium osmate were purchased from Aldrich, Os04 from Heraeus. 8% H202/tertbutanol solutions were used for the oxidation tests and the preparation of 2b. These solutions were prepared according to the reported method [28]; care was taken to keep the temperature of the mixture at 15-20 during the H202 addition. 4.1. Catalyst 2c 1 g PVP was suspended in a solution of 100 mg potassium osmate in 10 mL H20 and stirred over night. During the fixation the pink color of the solution disappeared and the color of the polymer turned to brown. The solid was filtered off and dried under reduced pressure. 4.2. A typical oxidation experiment with 2b as catalyst 25 mg of 2b (ca. 5% Os) was suspended in 5 to 10 mL H202/tert-BuOH (8%). Then 0.5 mmol alkene was added at 10-15 and the reaction mixture was stirred for 4-7 h at room temperature. 4.3. Di-ii-oxo-tetra(oxo)tetrakis(4-tert-butyl pyridine)diosmium(VI) A solution of 270 mg (1.1 mmol) Os04 in 2 mL of THF and 1 mL (6.8 mmol) of 4-tert-butyl pyridine was allowed to stand for 3-4 days. A brown precipitate or crystals were obtained. The solid was filtered off, washed with n-hexane and dried under reduced pressure.
