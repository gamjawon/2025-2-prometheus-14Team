Monodisperse CoxPdy alloy nanoparticles supported on reduced graphene oxide (CoxPdy @rGO) were synthesized and served as an efficient and recyclable catalyst for the chelation-assisted ortho C–H bond the alkenylation and cyclization of benzamides. The effect of the metal composition in CoxPdy on the catalytic activity was studied, and it was found that there is a synergistic effect between the Co and Pd. The rGO has been proved to play a crucial role in preventing aggregation of alloy nanoparticles, maintaining good dispersion, high catalytic activity and stability. Controllable synthesis of alkenylation and cyclization products can be achieved by modifying the reaction conditions. In addition, the catalyst was stable and recyclable, and the activity decay in the recovery and scale-up experiments is negligible, providing a mild and highly efficient method for direct C(sp2)−H functionalization. Graphical Abstract Cobalt-palladium alloy nanoparticles supported on reduced graphene oxide (Co3Pd1 @rGO) can be used as stable and recyclable catalyst for ortho C–H activation of benzamides. Achieved the controllable synthesis of arylated alkenes and isoindolinones. ga1 Keywords CoPd alloy nanoparticles Reduced graphene oxide Recyclable catalyst C−H alkenylation Cyclization 1 Introduction Inert C−H bonds exist in every natural organic molecule. The functionalization of these C−H bonds is of important synthetic value, providing a way for the formation of a large number of organic compounds, biologically active natural products and drug molecules [1]. In the past several decades, direct C–H bond functionalization catalyzed by transition metals such as Ru, Rh, Pd is a powerful and atom- and step-economical synthetic method to construct novel C–C, C–O, C–S and C–N bonds [2]. Among them, arylated olefins and isoindolinone derivatives can be synthesized through directing group assisted C(sp2)–H bond activation and oxidative coupling with olefins [3]. However, these metals are expensive, and due to excessive dependency on them, they are gradually disappearing from the earth’s crust. Therefore, it has become a trend to develop transition metal catalysts with rich reserves and low price, such as iron, cobalt, nickel and copper [4]. In recent years, low-cost cobalt catalysts have attracted much attention because of their unique catalytic performance, low toxicity and industrial application prospects [5]. Nonetheless, these homogeneous catalysts are temperature sensitive, difficult to separate and unstable in air, which limits the practical application of transition metal catalyzed C–H activation reactions [6]. The development of metal nanocatalysts with high activity and selectivity has aroused great interest in heterogeneous catalysis [7]. As we all know, metal nanoparticles (NPs) with high catalytic activity usually have high surface energy and are easy to aggregate, resulting in reduced activity. One of the most effective ways to avoid their aggregation is to confine the metal NPs in support materials. The support immobilizes the nano-structured catalyst on its surface to prevent its aggregation, increases its exposed surface area to adsorb reactants, thereby maintaining its high catalytic activity and selectivity [8]. The graphene family such as graphene [9], graphene oxide (GO) [10], reduced graphene oxide (rGO) [11] are considered as ideal supports for fixing metal nanoparticles because of their high surface area, excellent electrical conductivity and thermal stability, significant chemical inertness [12]. In order to further improve the catalytic performance of precious metal catalysts, alloying with the abundant metals on the earth can not only reduce their consumption, but also change their electronic and geometric properties at the same time. Recently, alloy NPs supported on rGO such as AuPd@rGO [13], AgPd@rGO [14], NiPd@rGO [15], CuPd@rGO [16], etc. have found potential catalytic applications on hydrogenation, oxidation, cross-couplings reaction and C–H activation reactions. It is precisely due to the synergistic effect of metal-metal and metal-rGO support interactions that graphene-supported alloy NPs exhibit strong and adjustable catalytic activity and selectivity [17,18]. Considering high activity of cobalt in C(sp2)–H bond activation, we are pleased to find that monodisperse CoxPdy @rGO can efficiently activate ortho C–H of benzamide. Controllable synthesis of alkenylation and cyclization products can be realized by modifying the reaction conditions. Compared with previous catalysts for the oxidative C−H alkenylation and cyclization of benzamides, heterogeneous Co3Pd1 @rGO catalyst shows high catalytic activity, low catalyst loading, good recyclability and stability, and significant controllability. 2 Preparation of the catalyst and characterization The CoxPdy @rGO nanocomposites were prepared by a modified co-reduction protocol [19]. In a typical procedure for the synthesis of Co3Pd1 @rGO, a solution of GO (80 mL, 1 mg/mL), CoCl2·6H2O (15 mL, 0.02 mol/L) and Na2PdCl4 (5 mL, 0.02 mol/L) were mixed and reduced by NaBH4 (2.0 mL, 1.0 mol/L), the resulting mixture was heated at 85 °C for 4 h under vigorous stirring. The product was collected by centrifugation and washed several times with de-ionized water. Thereafter, the product was dried at 60 °C for 24 h in a vacuum oven to remove the water, and then stored in a desiccator for further analysis. The CoxPdy @rGO nanocomposites were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), inductively coupled plasma optic emission spectrometer (ICP-OES), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and then the as-prepared CoxPdy @rGO NPs of catalytic application on C−H activation were investigated (in Supporting Information). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalysts characterizations CoxPdy @rGO nanocomposites (x = 3, 1, 0; y = 0, 1, 3) of varying compositions were prepared via an in situ reduction of CoCl2·6H2O and Na2PdCl4 with NaBH4 [20]. The composition of the CoPd@rGO were controlled by changing the molar ratio of CoCl2·6H2O and Na2PdCl4, and the obtained samples were carefully characterized before catalytic studies (Fig. S1). It can be seen from the transmission electron microscope (TEM) image ( Fig. 1a) that the obtained Co3Pd1 NPs were well dispersed on the rGO surface, with an average diameter of approximately 3.8 nm (inset bottom left corner of Fig. 1a). The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image (inset top right corner of Fig. 1a) shows high crystallinity of the Co3Pd1 NPs, and the lattice spacing is measured as 0.214 nm. This value lies between the (111) interplanar spacing of Co (0.210 nm) and Pd (0.225 nm). Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, Fig. 1b) suggested that the atomic ratio of Co to Pd in the nanoparticles is about 3.08/1, which matches the value obtained by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, nCo/nPd=3.16/1). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the prepared samples were investigated to reveal the phase structure and composition. As provided in Fig. 1c, the diffraction peaks of CoPd@rGO shift to higher angles as compared to those of Pd@rGO because the atomic radius of Co is smaller than that of Pd, the crystal plane spacing of CoPd is smaller than that of Pd. In the XRD patterns of CoPd@rGO and Co@rGO, a peak at about 37º can be assigned to Co3O4 (JCPDS card, No. 65-3103). The presence of Co3O4 is because that Co NPs are easy to be oxidized in air. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) further confirmed the composition and surface chemical state of the nanocomposite [21]. Fig. 2a shows the wide-scan spectra of Co3Pd1 @rGO, indicating the presence of Co, Pd, O and C elements. The high-resolution C 1 s spectrum displays three deconvolution peaks at 284.7, 286.0 and 288.6 eV (Fig. 2b), belonging to the CC, C–O of epoxy and/ or alkoxy groups, and CO, respectively [21(a)]. The high-resolution Co 2p spectrum (Fig. 2c) shows spin-orbit 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 doublets. The fitted peaks at binding energies of 795.9 and 780.5 eV are attributed to CoIII, while those of 797.8 and 782.3 eV are attributed to CoII [21(b), (c)]. The appearance of CoII and CoIII indicates that most of Co exists in the oxidation state, which is mainly the result of the oxidation of Co NPs in the air [22]. The high-resolution spectrum of Pd 3d could be deconvoluted into two pairs of peaks (Fig. 2d). One pair at 335.9 and 341.2 eV is attributed to the metallic Pd0, and others at 337.3 and 343.1 eV belong to PdII [23]. Obviously, metallic Pd0 is the dominant species based on the analysis of integrated area for these peaks. 3.2 Performance of catalyst for the C−H activation 3.2.1 Optimization of the reaction conditions In order to investigate the catalytic application of the as-prepared CoPd@rGO NPs on C−H activation, 4-methyl-N-(quinolin-8-yl)benzamide (1a) and methyl acrylate (2a) were selected as model substrates and pivalic acid (PivOH) was used as additive to determine the optimal reaction conditions ( Table 1). Initially, the reaction of 1a and 2a was carried out in the presence of 10 mg of Co1Pd1 @rGO and 1.3 equiv of PivOH in chlorobenzene (PhCl) at 100 °C under air atmosphere for 4 h, 3aa was obtained in 58% yield (Table 1, entry 1). We were pleased to find that the yield of 3aa increased substantially to 93% when 10 mg of Co3Pd1 @rGO (4.93 mol% Co, 1.56 mol% Pd) was employed as catalyst (Table 1, entry 2). Cu1Pd1 @rGO and Ag1Pd1 @rGO were inert toward the C−H bond activation and the catalytic performance of Co@rGO, Pd@rGO and Co1Pd3 @rGO was less effective than Co3Pd1 @rGO, which showed that there is a synergistic effect between Co and Pd atoms and the synergistic effect is closely related to the atomic ratio of Co/Pd (Table 1, entries 3–7). In contrast, when unsupported Co3Pd1 alloy NPs were used as catalyst, 3aa was obtained in 33% yield (Table 1, entry 8). This can be attributed to the fact that rGO can effectively restrain the aggregation of alloy NPs and improve the catalytic activity. Compared with the homogeneous catalysts Pd(OAc)2 (10 mol%) and Co(OAc)2.4 H2O (10 mol%), Co3Pd1 @rGO has excellent catalytic activity and selectivity (Table 1, entries 9–10). Furthermore, the application of commercial Pd/C (10 mg) as catalyst resulted in a 12% yield of 3aa (Table 1, entry 11), indicating that common Pd0 catalysts are ineffective for alkenylation. Undoubtedly, comparative experiment shows that the reaction will not occur without catalyst (Table 1, entry 12). When 5 mg of Co3Pd1 @rGO was added, the yield of 3aa decreased to 33% (Table 1, entry 13). However, when 15 mg of Co3Pd1 @rGO was added, the yield of 3aa did not change significantly (Table 1, entry 14). To our surprise, the cyclization product 4aa was obtained with 53% yield when Ag2CO3 (2 equiv) was used as additives. Further studies have shown that the yield of 4aa can be increased to 75% when the reaction is carried out in CH3CN at 120 °C (Table 1, entries 15–17). Increasing the reaction temperature or prolonging the reaction time can increase the yield of 4aa (Table 1, entries 18–20). Finally, only a trace amount of product 3aa was observed when the reaction was performed under an argon atmosphere, indicating that the air atmosphere is crucial for the reaction (Table 1, entry 21). Therefore, we have concluded that the optimal reaction conditions for alkenylation are catalyst (10 mg Co3Pd1 @rGO), additives (0.26 mmol PivOH) and solvent (PhCl), in an air atmosphere at 100 °C for 4 h (Table 1, entry 2). Furthermore, the reaction conditions for the cyclization reaction were optimized as follows: 10 mg of catalyst Co3Pd1 @rGO, CH3CN as the solvent, 0.4 mmol Ag2CO3 as the additive, under an air atmosphere at 120 °C (Table 1, entry 17). 3.2.2 Substrate scope of C−H bond alkenylation With the optimized reaction conditions in hand (Table 1, entry 2), the scope of C−H alkenylation catalyzed by Co3Pd1 @rGO was investigated, and the results are shown in Scheme 1. We are pleased to find that the reaction has broad applicability. Generally, both electron-donating substituents such as methyl, methoxy and tertiary butyl (3aa−3da), and electron-withdrawing substituents such as Cl, Br and CF3 on the phenyl ring of amide (3ea−3ga) were well tolerated during the C−H alkenylation. However, the desired products were not obtained upon using NO2 substituted benzamide. Notably, this reaction was compatible with 1-naphthylamide, 2-thiophene amide and pyridyl amide and gave the desired products 3ia, 3ja and 3ka in high yields. Under the optimized reaction conditions, the scope of the acrylates in the Co3Pd1 @rGO-catalyzed aryl C−H alkenylation was also investigated. The desired alkenylation product can be obtained in good yield by replacing methyl in acrylate with ethyl, butyl or isobutyl (3ab−3ad). However, the replacement of methyl with tert-butyl (3ae) resulted in lower yields, which may be due to steric hindrance. It is important to note that cyclohexylethylene was also compatible for the reaction, the product 3af was observed in 45% yield. Unfortunately, attempts to react 4-methyl-N-(quinolin-8-yl)benzamide with other olefin coupling partners such as acrylic acid, ethyl vinyl ketone, acrylonitrile and diethyl vinylphosphonate under current reaction conditions were unsuccessful. It is worth mentioning that the scale-up reaction (20 times) of 4-methyl-N-(quinolin-8-yl)benzamide (1a) and methyl acrylate (2a) resulted in 83% yield, indicating the potential application of the prepared catalyst in practical medicine and material chemical industry. Reaction conditions: 1 (0.2 mmol), 2 (0.4 mmol). Yields of isolated product are listed. a Yield of gram-scale reaction in parentheses. b Reaction time was extended to 12 h. 3.3 Performance of catalyst for the C−H cyclization In addition, the scope of the Co3Pd1 @rGO catalyzed cyclization reaction was studied under optimized reaction conditions (Table 1, entry 16). As shown in Scheme 2, both electron-donating group (Me) and electron-withdrawing group (F) at the ortho- or para-position of benzamide reacted with 2a smoothly, providing the expected isoquinolone derivatives (4aa−4da) in good yields. The present reaction was also compatible with phenyl acrylate and phenyl acetylene, products 4ag and 4ah were observed in 70% and 92% yields, respectively. To our delight, 2-methylbenzamide 1c reacted with various acrylates under the optimized reaction conditions, providing cyclized products 4ca–4cg in high yields. Reaction conditions: 1 (0.2 mmol), 2 (0.4 mmol). Yields of isolated product are listed. a 4 h. 3.4 Recyclability of the catalyst As far as heterogeneous catalysts are concerned, their stability and recyclability have always been the focus of attention. We turn to investigate the stability and recyclability of the prepared Co3Pd1 @rGO catalyst by using 1a and 2a as model reaction under optimal reaction conditions. As shown in Fig. 3, no remarkable loss of catalytic activity was observed after six runs. The characterization of the recovered catalyst reveals the reason for maintaining high catalytic activity. The TEM image (Fig. S2a) showed that the diameter of Co3Pd1 NPs increased slightly after six times of recovery, but the particles were still uniformly distributed on the surface of rGO without obvious agglomeration, which also helped to maintain high catalytic activity. The XRD pattern (Fig. S2b) and XPS measurements (Fig. S2c and S2d) suggested that no obvious change in the elemental contents and chemical valence states of Co3Pd1 NPs after catalytic use. ICP-OES analysis of the solution after removing the solid catalyst showed that there was no obvious Co or Pd leaching (<1 ppm) in the reaction system, indicating that the catalytic activity derived from Co3Pd1 NPs rather than from the leached Co or Pd. The results show that the Co3Pd1 @rGO catalyst has heterogeneous catalytic characteristics. 3.5 Plausible reaction mechanism To gain insight into the reaction mechanism of the C−H alkenylation, some control experiments were carried out (for details, see Supporting Information). The influence of the directing group on the efficiency of the alkenylation reaction was investigated. When the amide 1′−4′ were used as substrates, the reaction hardly occurred (Table S1), indicating that the presence of bidentate directing group is essential for the activation of C−H bond and the formation of the cyclometalated intermediate [24]. 3aa can be converted to 4aa under standard reaction conditions (Scheme S2), indicating that the alkenylation product may be an intermediate in the cyclization reaction. The intermolecular kinetic isotope effects (KIE) and ortho-alkenylation of the isotopically labeled substrates were investigated (Scheme S3, S4 and S5). It was found that treating [D5]-1h with methyl acrylate 2a under the standard conditions afforded product [Dn]-3ha in 77% yield with the loss of 4% of ortho deuterium (96% of deuterium was retained). The results confirmed that the initial ortho-C−H cobaltalation is irreversible. In the intermolecular competition reaction of N-(quinolin-8-yl)benzamide 1h and [D 5 ]-1h with methyl acrylate 2a (Scheme S4, S5), the kinetic isotope effect (KIE) value of 1.1 was observed by NMR analysis. The results indicated that the C−H cleavage might not be the rate determining step. Based on above-mentioned experiments and previous literature [5(a),5(b)], a plausible mechanism for the Co3Pd1 @rGO catalyzed heterogeneous ortho C–H bond alkenylation of amides with acrylates was proposed in Scheme 3. Firstly, the surface Co atoms of bimetallic NPs are oxidized to Co(III) by air in the presence of PivOH. Then, Co(III) coordinates with the two nitrogen atoms of the 1a to form intermediate A. Meanwhile, under the chelation assistance of the aminoquinoline, ortho-C–H bond cobaltion of benzamide provides an active cyclometalated Co(III) intermediate B. Subsequently, 2a coordinate to intermediate B and migratory insertion into a C–Co bond affords intermediate D. Subsequent β-hydride elimination delivers alkenylation product 3aa, which is accompanied by regeneration of Co(I) to restart the catalytic cycle. Finally, 3aa undergoes an intramolecular alkene hydroamidation to form cyclized product isoindolinones 4aa. 4 Conclusions In summary, we have demonstrated that CoPd nanoparticles anchored on rGO can be used as recyclable catalysts for direct aryl C–H alkenylation and cyclization of benzamides with acrylates under mild conditions. The heterogeneous Co3Pd1 @rGO catalyst was broadly applicable and could be easily recovered and reused. It is worth noting that due to the synergic effect between Co and Pd in the NPs, extraordinary catalytic activity was achieved compared to other monometallic NPs and homogeneous catalysts, and the synergic effect is related to the atomic ratio of Co-to-Pd. The rGO has been proved to play a key role in preventing its aggregation, furnishing the well-dispersed NPs catalyst with high stability and good reusability. These findings are important because the alloying of Pd and other transition metals represents a new strategy to develop high-performance and recyclable nanoparticles toward direct C−H functionalization with potential practical applications. It also provides a platform to gain insight into the underlying mechanisms of heterogeneous catalysis in surface chemistry.

        "dc:description": "Monodisperse CoxPdy alloy nanoparticles supported on reduced graphene oxide (CoxPdy @rGO) were synthesized and served as an efficient and recyclable catalyst for the chelation-assisted ortho C–H bond the alkenylation and cyclization of benzamides. The effect of the metal composition in CoxPdy on the catalytic activity was studied, and it was found that there is a synergistic effect between the Co and Pd. The rGO has been proved to play a crucial role in preventing aggregation of alloy nanoparticles, maintaining good dispersion, high catalytic activity and stability. Controllable synthesis of alkenylation and cyclization products can be achieved by modifying the reaction conditions. In addition, the catalyst was stable and recyclable, and the activity decay in the recovery and scale-up experiments is negligible, providing a mild and highly efficient method for direct C(sp2)−H functionalization.",
