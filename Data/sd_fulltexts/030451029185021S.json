The IR band of terminal CO adsorbed on this Cr(II)-A species is shifted by 5 cm-1 to 2183 cm-', which is interpreted as due to decreasing electron density at the chromium ion. These results are in agreement with polymerization measurements described in the literature, in which a narrowing of the molecular weight distribution of the polymer and a better comonomer incorporation were observed. Treatment of the Phillips catalyst with (NH4)ZSiFe decreases the amount of surface silanol groups during the activation between 600 and 800 C by some 80% but shifts the O-H IR band of the remaining silanol groups only by 1 cm-1. It is concluded that :fluorine covers almost the entire surface, but is not bonded together with OH at the same silicon atom. However, from a comparison of the IR bands from CO adsorbed on chromium supported on silica gel or amorphous AlP04, it is concluded that fluorine is bonded to the silicon atom that binds to chromium via an oxygen atom. Modification of the (NH4)ZSiFe treated Phillips catalyst with titanium showed only a small effect. Introduction The Phillips catalyst (Cr(VI) on silica gel) [ 1, 2] in its catalytically active form has been shown to consist of several chromium(II) and chromium(III) surface species [3-11] of which the Cr(II)-Ad(dominant), Cr(II)-Cd and the Cr(III)d species are catalytically active for the polymerization of ethylene [3]. The subscript d indicates that these surface species are dinuclear, with two chromium ions connected by an oxygen bridge. The two chromium(II) species are identified by IR spectra of terminal and bridging CO, and the latter CO is an indication of dinuclear chromium(H) surface species. The Cr(H)-Ad and CT(II)-Cd surface compounds are different, because the -C species has an oxygen from a surface siloxane group as an extra ligand and the chromium is therefore three-coordinated. Evidence for dinucleax chromium(III) surface species is only indirect [12]. The different chromium surface species and the IR bands of CO adsorbed on these species are summarized in Table 1 (together with new ones from this work). 0304-5102/91/$3.50 O Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 60 TABLE 1 IR bands of CO adsorbed on chromium surface species on the reduced Phillips catalyst and related systems Species Coord.

Preparation of chromium catalysts with only one active chromium species, or at least with one species considerably enhanced, is therefore one possibility to improve the Phillips catalyst. In fact, the chromium(III) surface species can be prepared with 100% purity [ 13-18 ], but its catalytic activity in industrial prototype reactors is some eight times lower [ 18 ] than that of the normal Phillips catalyst, and the molecular weight of the polymer is much higher [18]. The same is observed for the Phillips catalyst activated at only 500 C [19] (vs. 800 C normally used) and it was therefore concluded that the Cr(II)-Bm surface species, which has an extra oxygen ligand from a surface siianol group and is observed in these catalysts together with chromium(III), is converted into a chromium(III) surface species prior to polymerization [10]. The subscript m indicates mononuclear surface compounds. Recently, it was found [20] that the modification of the Phillips catalyst with titanium [21-28] increases the relative amount of the Cr(II)-Cd species, so that this surface species can now become the dominant one. The titanium modification \"increases the polymer melt index\" [28] or in other words decreases the molecular weight of the produced polymer. It becomes clear now that the different catalytically active chromium surface species indeed have different kinetic parameters for the seperate reaction steps of the polymerization. Another modification of the Phillips catalyst described in the patent literature [29-32] is the fluorination, preferably with (NH4)2SiFg, which \"leads to a better comonomer incorporation and to a polymer of narrower molecular 61 weight distribution\" [281. The aim of the present work is to determine whether these two effects are mirrored by the chromium surface species. Experimental Three different silica gels were used as supports: (1) silica gel 60, Merck 7733, (2) Grace/Davisson 952 and (3) Grace/Davisson 955. These silica gels differ in their surface area (600, 320 and 300 m2 g-', respectively), pore volume (0.5, 1.8 and 1.5 cm' g-') and their mean pore diameter (60, 200 and 200 A). The supports were impregnated with Cr03 in aqueous solution to yield catalysts with 0.5 wt.% chromium and dried at 120 C in air. In a second series of catalysts, 2.5 wt.% (NH4)ZSiFg was added to the aqueous solution. One sample (silica gel 955) was impregnated with 4 mmol Ti as titanylacetylacetonate in ethanol, dried at 80 C in air and calcined at 500 C in air. Thereafter this support was impregnated with chromium and (NH4)ZSiFs as before. Self-supporting discs of the catalysts (65 mg, 2 cm diameter) were heated in an IR cell to 800 C and treated with oxygen and evacuated several times. Thereafter the chromium(VI) was reduced by CO at 350 C. The CO was evacuated at 300 C and the first spectrum was recorded at room temperature. The cell was filled with CO (10 kPa) and spectra were recorded at room temperature, at -85 C and -120 C (100 Pa CO). The cell was again evacuated (0.1 Pa) at room temperature, 50 C and 100 C and IR spectra recorded each time. The first spectrum was subtracted from all CO spectra. The IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet FTIR spectrometer 20 SXC with a resolution of 2 cm-' and 1024 scans were accumulated. The wavenumbers are accurate to within 0.2 cm-'. In order to estimate the accuracy of the intensities for a quantitative discussion, the integrated absorbance for unmodified chromium/silica gel samples was measured between 2070 and 2000 cm-'. Such a calculation gave values of 2.26, 2.42 and 2.73 for spectra 1 in Figs. 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The relative error might therefore be estimated as 10%. One should also keep in mind that combination or overtone vibrations from the supports can be used as internal standards in order to achieve higher accuracy. For silica gel these are IR bands at 1873 and 1640 cm-'. Such a calculation, which is not used in the results below, decreases the relative error to 5%. Results In Fig. 1 CO IR spectra recorded at -120 C are shown using silica gel 955 as the support. The main difference between the fluorinated catalyst (spectrum 2) and the normal one (spectrum 1) is found at the CO IR bands at - 2190 and - 2040 cm-'. For the normal catalyst, CO bands from terminal CO adsorbed on chromium(III) are observed near 2200 cm-' (here at 2198.8 62 ABSORBANCE 10.43 II II I. .I I 1 I 1 I I 1 2\\ 1 \\ 2200 2150 2100 2050 WAVENUMBER (cm-1) Fig. 1.

Both CO IR bands are much weaker for the modified catalyst. Even the CO IR band at 2182.7 cm-' from terminal CO on the Cr(II)-Am species is weaker on the modified catalyst and has shifted to 2184.2 cm-1. A small band at 2158.3 cm-' shows similar intensity for both catalysts and is shifted somewhat to 2159.7 cm-'. The weak band at 2146.5 cm-' is however, removed. The three large CO IR bands (from bridging CO [5, 7]) at lower wavenumbers (the stretching vibration of CO gas is at 2143 cm-') are shifted to higher wavenumbers and have only 75/0 of the intensity after modification of the catalyst (integrated absorbance: 57.2 and 77.8). The shift increases with increasing distance from the IR band of CO gas (2118.7 versus 2119.6 cm-', 2098.1 versus 2100.6 cm-' and 2033.5 versus 2039.9 cm-'). Most important is that the broad CO IR band at 2040 cm-' becomes narrower due to the strong decrease of the IR band from the Cr(II)-Cd species at 2043.3 cm-' (shifted to 2051.6 cm-') on treatment of the Phillips catalyst with (NH4)ZSiFs. Using silica gel 952, the same effects are observed on modification of the Phillips catalyst with (NH4)2SiFg, as shown in Fig. 2. Only differences in the intensities of the CO IR bands are noticed. With silica gel 60, the effects on modification are not as strong as with the other two supports (Fig. 3). In particular the decrease of the CO IR band from CO adsorbed on chromium(III) near 2200 cm-' is smaller than observed on the other silica gels. Figure 4 shows that also the CO IR bands from terminally adsorbed CO on Cr(II)-Ad (2178.1 cm-') and Cr(II)-Cd (2188.1 cm-') (spectrum 1), which are observed at higher temperatures than the bridging CO IR bands, are shifted for the fluorinated catalysts (spectrum 2) to 2183.3 and 2192.3 cm-', respectively.

Figure 5 shows that the CO adsorbed on the Cr(II)-Cd species is more strongly bonded than that on the Cr(II)-Ad species: one observes a relative increase in the CO IR band at 2192.3 cm-' over that at 2183.3 cm-1 on successive evacuations. Therefore the CO IR bands from terminal CO are not useful for a quantitative determination of the amount of the different chromium surface species. One notices also that the CO IR band at 2182.5 cm-1 is shifted to 2185.8 cm-1 on modification (spectrum I, Figure 5), which at 3.3 cm-', is less than that observed for the other two CO IR bands (5.2 and 4.2 cm-1). The CO IR bands from terminal CO adsorbed on chromium(II) surface compounds are reduced to 90% on cooling to -120 C, while the new band from bridging CO appears (spectra 1 and 5 in Fig. 5).

FrIR spectra of CO adsorbed on unmodified (spectrum 1) and (NH4)ZSiFe-modified (spectrum 2) reduced Phillips catalysts (silica gel 955). The catalyst was activated with OZ and reduced with CO at only 500 C in order to prepare the Cr(II)-B surface species. The spectra were recorded at -120 C. weak shift of 1.2 cm-' to higher wavenumbers (from 3746.0 to 3747.2 cm-') is observed (spectra 1 and 3). This is quite small compared with shifts observed for surface aluminium hydroxyl (3794 cm-1) and phosphorus hydroxyl groups (3678 cm-') [33, 34]. Using activation and reduction temperatures of 500 C for the preparation of the catalysts, which yields Cr(II)-Bm, CO IR spectra at low temperatures exhibit only weak CO IR bands from bridging CO (Mg. 7) at 2093.7, 2045.8 and 2032.1 cm-' for the unmodified (spectrum 1) and at 2119.1, 2096.6, 2052.1 and 2038.4 cm-' for the modified one (spectrum 2). It is important 66 to note the ten-fold increase in the absorbance scale in FIg. 7 compared to Figs. 1-3. The unmodified catalyst shows a (strong) CO IR band from terminal CO at 2184.7 cm-' and a shoulder at 2196.4 cm-', which are both shifted to higher wavenumbers on modification to 2187.6 and 2198.4 cm-' respectively. As one can see from Fig. 8 the surface silanol groups are weaker, using an activation temperature of 500 C after modification of the catalyst with (NH4)ZSiFs by less than 20% (spectrum 2), which is much lower than the difference observed after 800 C. The Cr(II)-Cd species can be enhanced by heating the Cr(II)-Ad species in vacuum to higher temperatures for longer time (here 700 C for 30 min) [5, 7].

Phillips catalyst (spectrum 2) than for the unmodified one (spectrum 1), but is still noticeable with the CO IR band from bridging CO at 2053.6 (2043.8 cm-') compared to 2046.3 (2037.9 cm-'). The CO IR bands from terminal CO at chromium(III) 2198.4 and 2200.4 cm-' (modified catalyst) are much higher than in previous spectra. The enhancement of the Cr(II)-Cd species was also observed in CO IR spectra of terminal CO at room temperature or on evacuation at higher temperatures. As mentioned in the introduction, addition of titanium to the Phillips catalyst increases the relative amount of Cr(II)-Cd species. Therefore a catalyst with both titanium and fluorine was investigated. As Fig. 10 spectrum 1 shows, only a small broadening of the CO IR band at 2040 cm-' was observed, although the IR band from silanol groups increased by 300% compared with the fluorinated catalyst (spectra not shown). Discussion Known and new chromium surface species and the IR bands of adsorbed CO are listed in Table 1. The new surface species from fluorinated Phillips catalysts are designated Cr(II)-AFd and CR(II)-CFd in order to indicate that they are related to the Cr(II)-Ad and Cr(II)-Cd species of the unmodified Phillips catalyst. (NH4)ZSiFs can produce NH3, HF and SiF4 at higher temperatures, of which HF and SiF4 can react with surface silanol groups (structure A in Scheme 1) or perhaps even surface siloxane groups (structure B) to form surface (-O-)3Si-F groups (structure E). The observation that the ratio of surface hydroxyl groups after vacuum treatment at 500 and 800 C .for unmodified and modified catalysts increases dramatically is an indication that the release of water is favoured over the release of HF.

The few surface silanol groups left at 800 C should have no fluorine bonded at the same silicon atom (structure H in Scheme 1). As already mentioned in the introduction, the chromium(II) surface compounds are most likely dinuclear after activation at high temperatures, as shown in Scheme 1, structure C. Surface siloxane groups are close enough to move into chromium ligand positions, if the surface mobility is increased by higher temperatures (700 C) in order to form the Cr(II)-Cd species. On modification of the catalyst with fluorine, these siloxane groups are almost completely replaced by (-O-)3Si-F or even (-O-)ZSi-F2 groups, as shown in structure G in Scheme 1. Fluorine should also be bonded to the silicon atom close to the chromium ion, as depicted in structure G. In order to discuss the wavenumber shift of the stretching vibrations from the surface hydroxyl groups and from the CO adsorbed on chromium surface compounds, it must be remembered that the electronegativities (according to Allred/Rochow [35]) are: 0=3.5, Al=1.45, Si=1.74, P=2.05 and F=4.1. A linear relationship has been previously proposed between the electronegativity of Al, Si, B and P and the IR band of single surface O-H groups [34] bonded to tetrahedral surface units: elements less electronegative than Si will shift the band to higher wavenumbers and elements more electronegative will decrease the wavenumber, as indicated in Scheme 2. Fluorine, which is more electronegative than oxygen, will withdraw electrons from the silicon atom and should therefore shift the O-H IR band to lower wavenumbers. This is not observed for the Phillips catalyst modified with fluorine. In contrast, a small shift to higher wavenumber of 1.2 cm-1 was noted. Therefore surface structures similar to structure B in Scheme 2 are not likely on fluorinated silica gel surfaces. Chapman and Hair [ 37 ] investigated fluorinated porous glass and found no shift in the stretching vibration of 69 VO_H 3794 3746 3723 3678 1cm 1) /H /H /H ~H 0 0 0 0 I I I I /AI, /Sid /Si /P % O .0 /0 O 0 F O \\0 /0 O\\0, A 8 C D J 2167 2178 2183 2192 (CM-11 C=0 0 e0 &0 C '0 .iC:0 .XC :0 .ICN0 .1C\"O I I I I /AI, /Site /Sid /P\\ % ,'0 /0 0 0 F 01 0 0 o 01 0~ I I I I E F G H Scheme 2. the remaining hydroxyl groups (3745 cm-'). Even with this result they ascribed the higher cracking activity of such catalyst to a weakening of the hydroxyl bond due to the electronegativity of the fluorine, as shown by structure H in Scheme 1. This model has not been accepted in the literature [38]. A line of argument similar to that used above for single surface hydroxyl groups in Scheme 2, is now applied to the CO stretching vibration of CO adsorbed on Cr(II)-Ad surface compounds. As shown in Scheme 2, on chromium/AlOP4 catalysts two different Cr(II)-A surface cofounds with largely different CO IR bands from adsorbed CO are observed [36]: CO on chromium bonded to -O-P(-O-)3 units, and CO on chromium bonded to -O-Al(-O-)3 ones. In contrast to the shift of the O-H band, the CO IR band is shifted inversely to higher wavenumbers in the case of phosphorus units and to lower wavenumbers in the case of aluminium units, as indicated in Scheme 2. Therefore a shift to higher wavenumbers would be expected for the fluorinated catalyst of structure G in Scheme 2: this is also observed. The shift is some 5 cm-' and that on exchanging silicon by phosphorus 14 cm-'. A simple estimation based on the electronegativities of three oxygen ligands or two oxygen and one fluorine ligand at the silicon atom (10.5 versus 11.1 divided by three: A = 0.2)) might have an effect similar to decreasing the electronegativity at the silicon by 0.1 units. This would be one-third the effect of exchanging silicon by phosphorus, and is in agreement with the observed shift of the CO IR band in structures F, G and H in Scheme 2 (14 versus 5 cm-'). This simple estimation is valid for Cr(II)-Ad and -Cd (see Results). The same estimation leads to an OH IR band of 3723 cm-' for structure C in Scheme 2, which is, however, not observed. Calculations of imbedded orbital-stoichiometric clusters using the MINDO/3 semi-empirical approximations [39] of structures H in Scheme 1 70 and C in Scheme 2 showed only small effects and in particular no difference between structures A in Scheme 1 and C in Scheme 2, the latter, with an OH group instead of a -CrO- one. However, experimental results show a decrease in silica acidity on halogenation [40]. The CO IR band at 2182.5 cm-' from terminal CO is shifted by only 3.3 cm-' on fluorination. This is an indication that more than one CO molecule is adsorbed at the same chromium ion. Curiously, the IR shift for CO adsorbed on the chromium(III) surface compound is much less than expected (only 2 cm-'). No explanation can be forwarded for this at the moment. As already stated above, the modification of the Phillips catalyst with (NH4)ZSiFfi removes most of the chromium(II)-Cd and the chromium(III) surface species, so that the Cr(II)-Ad surface species is the only one left, although with somewhat lower electron density. This is in qualitative accordance with the observed narrower molecular weight distribution; the observed wavenumber shift from 2033.5 to 2039.9 cm-' of CO adsorbed on the Cr(II) AFd species can also explain the better comonomer incorporation [28]. It is, however, not clear at the moment how accurate a quantitative correlation between the CO IR spectra and the polymer weight distribution will be, because to our knowledge no such data have been published. The above results prove that the IR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO is a valuable tool for investigation of the Phillips catalyst and it can now be used to search for improved Phillips catalysts. One possible aim might be to prepare the Cr(II)-Cd species with decreased electron density similar to the Cr(II)-Ad one in the fluorinated Phillips catalyst. Another aim should be the preparation of chromium(II) surface species with lower electron density in high purity. Because the catalytically active chronuum surface species in the (modified) catalyst can be prepared in more or less pure form with the help of different procedures, it will now be possible to make detailed kinetic studies on the influence of the separate chromium surface species on the reaction rates of all the steps necessary for the production of polyethylene.

The IR band of terminal CO adsorbed on this Cr(II)-A species is shifted by 5 cm−1 to 2183 cm−1, which is interpreted as due to decreasing electron density at the chromium ion. These results are in agreement with polymerization measurements described in the literature, in which a narrowing of the molecular weight distribution of the polymer and a better comonomer incorporation were observed. Treatment of the Phillips catalyst with (NH4)2SiF6 decreases the amount of surface silanol groups during the activation between 600 and 800 °C by some 80% but shifts the OH IR band of the remaining silanol groups only by 1 cm−1. It is concluded that fluorine covers almost the entire surface, but is not bonded together with OH at the same silicon atom. However, from a comparison of the IR bands from CO adsorbed on chromium supported on silica gel or amorphous AlPO4, it is concluded that fluorine is bonded to the silicon atom that binds to chromium via an oxygen atom. Modification of the (NH4)2SiF6 treated Phillips catalyst with titanium showed only a small effect. References 1 A. Clark J.P. Hogan R.L. Banks W.C. Lanning Ind. Eng. Chem. 48 1956 1152 2 H.L.
