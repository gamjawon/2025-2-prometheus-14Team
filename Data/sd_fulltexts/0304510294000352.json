(Received October 1, 1993; accepted January 19, 1994) Abstract The activity and selectivity behaviour of Rh(py)3C13 and Rh(CO)Cl(PPh3)2 complex catalysts on various supports for carbonylation of nitrobenzene to methyl phenyl carbamate has been investigated. The best catalytic activity was shown by Rh(py)3C13 on y-A1203 and Rh(CO)Cl(PPh3)z/ zeolites catalysts. The effect of temperature, CO pressure and initial concentration of nitrobenzene on conversion of nitrobenzene and selectivity to methyl phenyl carbamate was studied. The results have been compared with the corresponding homogeneous catalysts. Carbon monoxide interaction with supported Rh catalyst was investigated using in-situ FT-IR spectroscopy. A plausible mechanistic pathway for carbonylation of nitrobenzene has been proposed. Keywords: activity; carbonylation; nitrobenzene; rhodium; selectivity; supported catalysts 1. Introduction Carbonylation of nitro compounds by metal complex catalysts has gained considerable importance due to its potential application as a non-phosgene route for the manufacture of carbamates and isocyanates [ 1 ] . Carbamates have important applications in pesticides and polyurethane manufacture [ 2 ] and they can also be transformed into isocyanates by thermal cracking [ 3 ] . Thus, the discovery of an alternative route for the synthesis of carbamates involving carbonylation of nitro compounds in the presence of aliphatic alcohols may *Corresponding author; fax.

Rode et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994)195-206 substitute the conventional reaction of dangerous and corrosive phosgene with amines [4]. The stoichiometric reactions in the carbonylation route can be represented as follows: ArN02 + 3C0 - ArNCO + 2C02 (1) ArNCO + ROH - ArNHCOOR (2) The overall reaction is: ArN02 + 3C0 + ROH - ArNHCOOR + 2COZ (3 ) The previous work [5-11 ] has mainly addressed the use of homogeneous metal complex catalysts, and there are only a few reports using supported metal catalysts [ 12-14] . In the present work, the activity and selectivity of supported rhodium complexes has been reported and compared with the homogeneous analogue. The differences in the activities of catalysts has been explained on the basis of FT-IR investigations. The advantages of the supported catalysts are well known, the most important among these are the relatively large specific surface area and the ease of separation from the reaction mixture. In the present work, the effect of temperature, CO pressure and concentration of nitrobenzene on the activity and selectivity of homogeneous as well as supported Rh(py)3C13 and Rh(CO)Cl(PPh3)2 catalysts has been studied for the carbonylation of nitrobenzene to phenyl methyl carbamate. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials The reactants, nitrobenzene and methanol used were freshly distilled and were dried over molecular sieves (3 A, which were calcined in an oven at 300-350 C). Carbon monoxide gas from the cylinders (maximum pressure 150 bar) having a purity greater than 99.8% was used. Rh (py) 3CI3 and Rh (CO) CI (PPh3) 2 complexes were prepared by the methods described elsewhere [ 10,15 ] . The supports used in the present study were (i) y-A1203 A64-K, having a BET surface area of 200 m2/ g and an average particle size of 1-2 lt,m. (ii) ZSM-5, having a surface area of 380 m2/g, pore volume of 0.7 cm3/g, particle size of 2-3 lt,m with 100% crystallinity. (iii) Zeolite-/3, having a surface area of 525 m2/g, pore volume of 0.22 cm'/g, particle size of 1-2 lt,m with 100% crystallinity. 2.2. Preparation of supported Rh catalysts To a beaker containing 100 cm3 of dichloromethane, 10 g of y-A1203 (or zeolite) was added under stirring. To this 50 cm3 solution containing 0.44 g of Rh(py)3C13 in CH2C12 was slowly introduced under constant stirring. After stirring for 90 min the mixture was filtered. It was observed that the filtrate was colourless, indicating that all the Rh complex has been adsorbed on the support. The catalyst was then calcined between 180-200 C for 5 h. A similar procedure was used in the preparation of Rh(CO)(PPh3)ZCl on y-A1203 C. V Rode et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91(1994) 195-206 197 catalyst except that 0.42 g of Rh complex was taken for impregnation. This led to the preparation of 1 % Rh supported catalysts. For the purpose of FT-IR studies, samples were prepared as thin wafers weighing around 15 mg/cm2, mounted on a quartz holder and placed in a FT-IR cell. This procedure allows the in-situ characterisation of activated catalyst under CO. IR spectra were recorded on a FT-IR instrument with a resolution of 2 cm-' at room temperature. 2.3. Apparatus Carbonylation experiments were carried out in a stainless steel autoclave of 150 cm 3 capacity. This reactor was provided with automatic temperature control, agitation and cooling coil. A glass ampule of approximately the same volume was used, in order to avoid direct contact of the reactants with the autoclave. 2.4. Experimental procedure In a typical experiment, known quantities of nitrobenzene (0.02 mol), supported catalyst (Rh content = 4.85 X 10- 5 mol) and FeC13 (9.25 X 10 -4 mol) were charged into the reactor along with methanol as a solvent, so as to make the reaction volume up to 70 cm3. Carbon monoxide was introduced to a desired pressure and the contents were heated to 165 C. The reaction was carried out for five hours, after which the contents were analysed for reactants and products. This analysis was carried out using Chrome 5 GC with FID. The column used was 1.2 m X 5 mm packed with XE 60, with temperature programming with a maximum column temperature of 220 C at the rate of initial temperature 20 C/min. The carrier gas (He) flow rate was 25 cm 3/min. For quantitative analysis, p-nitrotoluene was used as an internal standard. 3. Results and discussion In order to understand the role of supports and reaction conditions in carbonylation of nitrobenzene using Rh catalysts, several experiments were carried out in which the conversion of nitrobenzene and selectivity of phenyl methyl carbamate were observed. The results are presented for supported Rh(py)3C13 and Rh(CO)Cl(PPh3)2 catalysts in Tables 1, 2 and Figs. 1-1. It was generally observed that phenyl methyl carbamate was the major product in most of the conditions, however, the activity of the catalyst (presented as a conversion for a fixed duration of time) varied depending on the operating conditions. The effect of individual parameters is discussed below. 3.1. Effect of supports In this work the role of supports such as y-A1203, ZSM-5 and zeolite-/3, was investigated for Rh(py)3C13 and Rh(CO)Cl(PPh3)2 catalysts. It was observed that when Rh(py)3C13 is supported on y-A1203, higher activity is obtained as compared to zeolites supports (entries 2,3 and 4, Table 1). Pyridine is known to be chemisorbed on the y-A1203 surface [ 16] , therefore, it is likely that Rh(py)3C13 complex is strongly adsorbed on y-A1203- When 198 C. V.

Solvent=methanol zeolite is used as a support, the channel dimensions of ZSM-5 (5.4 X 5.6 A and 5.8 X 5.2 A) [ 17] does not allow penetration of the complex due to its large diameter (10.67 A) [ 18 ] , to get adsorbed on the entire surface (external + pore surface) of the catalyst, thus restricting the uniform distribution of Rh(py)3C13. On the other hand, Rh(CO)Cl(PPh3)2 complex supported on ZSM-5, gave the higher activity (see entries 6 and 7, Table 1) compared to that on A1203. This is a probable explanation and more work is required for a clear understanding of the observed results. Since Rh (py) 3C13/ -/-A1203 was the most active catalyst, detailed investigation of the effects of temperature, CO pressure, concentration of nitrobenzene etc. was carried out using this catalyst, the results of which are discussed in the following sections. 3.2. Effect of temperature The results on conversion and selectivity variation with temperature is shown in Fig. 1, for Rh(py)3C13/ y-A1203catalyst. It was observed that the conversion of nitrobenzene was C.

At low temperatures ( < 150 C), probably the intermediates formed are irreversibly adsorbed on the catalyst surface, thereby decreasing the isocyanate selectivity. While at higher temperatures ( > 170 C), carbamate decomposes into phenyl isocyanate which in turn is known to polymerize, decreasing the selectivity of carbamate [ 19] . 3.3. Effect of CO pressure Fig. 2(a) shows the effect of pressure of carbon monoxide on the conversion of nitrobenzene and selectivity of phenyl methyl carbamate at 165 C for Rh(py)3CI3/y-A1203 catalyst. It was observed that the conversion of nitrobenzene was directly proportional to CO pressure up to 100 atm, beyond which the conversion followed a negative order dependence on CO pressure. This may be due to deactivation of the catalyst caused by formation of inactive Rh carbonyl complexes at higher CO pressure [20]. The results for Rh(CO)CI(PPh3)2/y-A1203 are also shown in Fig. 2(b), which show similar trends. 3.4. Effect of nitrobenzene concentration The results for different concentrations of nitrobenzene are shown in Fig. 3, for Rh(py)3C13/y-A1203 at 165 C and 100 atm CO pressure. In this case the average activity 200 C. V.

Rode et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994)195-206 was found to be a mild function of nitrobenzene concentration, beyond a concentration of 2.80X 10' mol/cm3. These observations of a decrease in conversion with increase in concentrations of both the reactants, after a certain level, indicate the possibility of substrateinhibited kinetics at higher concentrations. 3.4. Effect of concentration of FeClj The effect of the concentration of FeC13 (a promoter) on the average activity is shown in Fig. 4, for Rh(py)3C13/y-A1203. It can be seen that conversion increases with increase in concentration of FeC13 indicating a significant promoting effect of FeC13, the maximum activity of catalyst was obtained at FeC13 concentration of 1.32 X 10-5 mol/cm3, beyond which the activity remains practically constant. The effect of oxidising agents is also studied for FeC13 and FeCl2 promoters (Table 1). The stronger oxidiser, FeC13, shows a higher activity than FeC12, a weaker oxidiser. From the results discussed above, a set of optimum reaction conditions can be obtained for the carbonylation of nitrobenzene to phenyl methyl carbamate using the Rh(py)3C13/ y-A1203 catalyst system as given below: Temperature 165 C Carbon monoxide pressure 100 atm FeC13 conc. 1.32 X 10-5 mol/cm3 Conversion of PhN02 99% Selectivity of methyl phenyl carbamate 98% Contact time 5 h 3.5. Comparison with homogeneous catalyst The carbonylation of nitrobenzene to phenyl methyl carbamate was also carried out using Rh (py) 3C13 complex in solution (see Table 1) . It was found that under the identical reaction conditions, the activity of the homogeneous catalyst was found to be 0.038 mol-nitrobenzene/g-Rh/h while that of heterogenised catalyst was 0.784 mol-nitrobenzene/g-Rh/h. It is interesting to note that even when the Rh concentration in solution was an order of magnitude higher than that used as the heterogenised catalyst, the conversion obtained was only 44%. 4. FT-111 of adsorbed catalytic species Bonding of CO in the supported transition metal catalysts is very important in understanding the catalytic properties of supported metal complexes. This aspect of catalysis has been reviewed earlier [ 21 ] . IR spectroscopy is particularly useful in determining the nature of interactions of CO with the support and noble metals [ 22] . The results for the carbonylation of nitrobenzene using Rh(py)3C13-A1203 and Rh (CO) Cl (PPh3) 2-A1203 catalyst system showed that, supported catalysts are more active than the corresponding homogeneous catalysts. In-situ IR spectroscopy was used to explain C. V. Rode et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 97 (1994)195-206 203 the role of the Rh-CO species formed during the CO pretreatment of the catalyst. For this purpose, FT-IR spectra of Rh (py) 3C13-AI203 and Rh (CO) (PPh3) ZCl-A1203 catalysts were studied under CO atmosphere and the results are discussed below: IR spectra of Rh(py)3C13-AI203 and Rh(CO)(PPh3)ZCI-A1203 are shown in Fig. 5 and 6, before and after exposure to CO, respectively. The spectra of Rh(py)3C13-A1203 does not show any absorption in the range 2200-1800 cm-', however, this sample, when exposed to 300 torr CO at 40 C, showed intense absorption bands at 2140, 2110 and 2020 cm-' with a shoulder at 2085 and 2030 cm-'.

The other bands in this region can be understood more clearly from the fact that the catalyst contains an organometallic moiety which is adsorbed on the solid support. Therefore, the nature of CO bonding in this catalyst would be affected by the presence of support. The homogeneous complexes of rhodium (III) containing pyridine ligands, are known to be very labile [24], A survey of Rh\" carbonyl halide complexes indicated that the CO stretching frequency lies in the range 2100 to 2050 cm-', [24,25]. Fig. 5 (2) shows some interesting features, besides the absorption band at 2140 cm-' (which is due to weakly adsorbed CO), there are two intense bands of almost the same intensity at 2110 and 2020 cm-' accompanied by two weak shoulders at 2085 and 2030 cm-'. The weak absorption bands at 2085 and 2030 cm-' arise from Rh'(CO)2 type species formed on the surface [26-28]. It is important to note that carbon monoxide acts as a reducing agent for the transformation of Rh\" to Rh' species. The intense bands at 2110 and 2020 cm-' are likely to be due to the adsorption of CO on Rh\"' (Fig. 5 (2)). The intensity of the band at 2110 cm-' decreases upon evacuation and this band shifts to a lower frequency at 2105 cm-' indicating that this weakly coordinated species changes into a stronger species with the loss of a CO molecule (Fig. 5 (4-6) ). The IR spectra of supported Rh(CO) (PPh3)ZCl on y-A1203 and subsequent treatment of this complex with CO are shown in Fig. 6. The supported Rh(CO) (PPh3)ZCl complex shows a strong absorption band at 1990 cm-' which is due to the CO coordinated to the Rh metal in the complex. In the free state the complex Rh (CO) (PPh3) ZCl shows a carbonyl stretching frequency at 1961 cm-'. This band is shifted to a higher frequency due to the interaction with the support. It is known that for Rh' complexes, CO stretching frequencies vary from 1947-1961 cm-', but for the corresponding Rh\" complex they are at least 100 cm-' higher. The increase in the IR frequency on going from Rh'to Rh,\" is due to a smaller back-donation of electrons from the Rh to the CO in the higher valency state, due to the increased positive charged with a corresponding increase in CO bond order and higher frequency [ 29 ] . A similar effect between the metal and support probably causes the increase in CO stretching frequency in the supported Rh complex. The intense band at 2140 cm-' region is due to the weakly adsorbed CO on support [ 23 ] , which disappears on evacuation. The band at 2110 cm-' seems to arise from a carbonyl species that is weakly coordinated to Rh. Upon evacuation, a species showing an absorption band at 2090 cm-' at 40 C is observed. Beyond 40 C, this species disappears (Fig. 6). A very weak absorption band is seen at 1980 cm-' which seems to arise from the bridged carbonyl species [ 26 ] . The only species that remains stable at higher temperature (i.e., 300 C) is the starting complex Rh(CO) (PPh3)ZCI. A comparison of results in Figs. 5 and 6 shows that a number of Rh-CO species are formed on Rh(py) 303 and Rh(CO) (PPh3)zCl supported on y-A1203. The supported complex Rh(py)3C13 shows higher stability for Rh-CO bonded species with increase in temperature compared to Rh(CO) (PPh3)ZCI. This finding shows that supported Rh(py)3C13 is a good carbonylation catalyst up to 300 C, whereas, Rh(CO) (PPh3)ZCl-A1203 will be more active at lower temperatures ( < 100 C) and inactive at higher temperatures. Thus, the higher activity observed for the catalyst Rh (py) 3C13-Al203 at 165 C is probably due to the higher stability of its carbonyl species under the reaction conditions. C. V. Rode et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 195-206 205 4.1. Proposed mechanism The mechanism of carbonylation of nitro compounds to isocyanates is not well understood at this stage. However, there is a general agreement among most of the researchers about the deoxygenation step which is believed to go via nitroso and nitrene intermediates [ 30,31 ] . A speculative mechanism is presented in Fig. 7. The catalyst precursor an 18 electron complex, Rh(py)3C13, reacts dissociatively with carbon monoxide to form a catalytic intermediate II. Species II adds to a nitro compound and then forms a nitrene complex V, through a nitroso species III. The cycle is completed with elimination of the isocyanate product and regeneration of species II. At a higher Pro pressure, species II is likely to convert into an inactive species VI, which is an 18 electron complex. Thus, the observed deactivation with high Pro is probably due to the presence of such species VI. While, at higher concentrations of nitro compound, species III, instead of reacting with CO adds to excess of nitro compounds forming inactive species IV, which is a vitro/nitroso complex. This explanation is entirely speculative and more work needs to be done to arrive at a definitive mechanism. o-Rh(py)3C13 py [18] (I) O Rh(py)2C13 [16] ~CO &Rh(py)(RNCO)Cl3 O RRh~/(py)2(CO)Cl3 S~Rh(py)(RN)(CO)Cl3 [16] [18] C [18] RNCO CO py So-Rh(py)(RN)Cl3 gS Rh(CO)3C13 2C0 aRh(py)(CO)Cl3 [16](V) [18in]( tVve p~ X16](11) C02 __ )_~_ RN02 So-Rh(py)(RNO)(CO)Cl3 S&Rh(py)(RN02)(CO)Cl3 [18] [18] )__~'&Rh(py)(RNO)CL3 CO [16](111) C02 py -1 2 RN02 S~Rh(RN02)2(RNO)Cl3 [I8](IV ) inactive Fig. 7.

Conclusion Carbamate synthesis by carbonylation of nitrobenzene in the presence of supported Rh (py) 3C13 and Rh (CO) Cl (PPh3) 2 catalysts was studied. It was found that the Rh(py)3C13/y-A1203 catalyst gave the best results (99% conversion and 98% selectivity of phenyl methyl carbamate) among all the catalysts studied. Under the identical conditions, the activity of homogeneous catalyst Rh(py)3C13 was found to be 20 times lower than the heterogenized analogue. The effect of various reaction conditions on the conversion and selectivity was studied using Rh (py) 3C13 / y-A1203 catalyst. It was found that the conversion of nitrobenzene decreases with increase in concentration of both CO and nitrobenzene beyond a certain value. The nature of CO activation has been studied using in situ IR spectroscopy, which indicates that Rh(CO) (Py)zC13 type of species are likely catalytic intermediates. A speculative reaction mechanism has been proposed. References [ 1 ] G.W. Parshal and S.D. Ittel, Homogeneous Catalysis, Wiley, New York, 1992. [2] N.N.
