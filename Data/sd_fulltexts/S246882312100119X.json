Graphical abstract A simple and recyclable biphasic rhodium catalytic system for the hydroformylation of long-chain alkenes is performed with the presence of Rh/TPPTS (trisodium tris(m-sulfophenyl)phosphine) in highly polar formamide for the first time. This work investigated the phase behavior of 1-octene, 1-nonanal and formamide, as well as the factors affecting the catalytic performance and catalyst recovery. Two phases were fully separated with distinct interface, allowing facile recycle of catalyst-containing formamide solution by decantation. Hydroformylation could be carried out under mild condition with turnover frequency and aldehyde selectivity up to 950 h−1 and 97 %, respectively. The catalyst could be reused for at least 40 runs without obvious activity and selectivity decline. No extra rhodium or TPPTS was needed during the cycle runs, and the average rhodium loss for each cycle was as low as 0.02 wt%. This system has also been successfully applied to the hydroformylation of crude higher α-olefins with high conversion and rhodium reservation, which were just distilled from Fischer-Tropsch synthesis with 64.7∼81.0 % fraction. Keywords Hydroformylation 1-Octene Formamide Biphasic catalysis Higher olefins 1 Introduction The hydroformylation reaction is one of the most widely used homogeneous catalytic reactions in the chemical industry, and the products aldehydes are of great commercial value, which can be used as intermediates for detergents, plasticizers and pharmaceuticals [1–3]. The precious metal such as rhodium employed in hydroformylation must be well recovered and recycled for economic and environmental consideration [4,5]. In homogeneous catalysis, catalyst separation via distillation sometimes leads to catalyst decomposition and deactivation due to thermal stress [6], and it is the challenging task of catalyst separation that makes the proportion of homogeneous catalytic reactions less than 20 % in all industrial catalytic processes [7]. In order to tackle this problem, aqueous-organic biphasic catalysis has been developed. The superiority of this elegant concept has been proven by the successful industrial application in the hydroformylation of propylene and butene, namely Ruhrchemie/Rhône-Poulenc process [8,9]. In this process, rhodium is efficiently anchored in the aqueous layer via the sulfonated water-soluble ligand TPPTS (trisodium tris(m-sulfophenyl)phosphine), and the solubility of lower alkenes (ethylene, propene and butene) in the aqueous phase is high enough to ensure the reaction rate. The product aldehyde is in the organic phase, which allows for the recycling of the catalyst by phase separation. However, applying this promising approach to long-chain alkenes suffers from severe mass transfer limitation, as olefins higher than C4 have significantly lower solubility in aqueous phase, rendering the productivity too low to be economically viable [10,11]. To cope with the inherent limitation of low substrate-solubility in aqueous phase, researchers have proposed many approaches for the hydroformylation of long-chain alkenes. One strategy is performing the reaction under monophasic solvent in order to avoid mass transportation limitation, while transferring the catalysts to another phase after reaction for easy separation. For example, Cole-Hamilton et al. [12] reported that the solubility of the catalyst in aqueous and organic phase could be reversibly switched by adding or removing CO2, since the ligand could be protonated by the aqueous solution of CO2. Analogously, Jin [13,14] developed the thermoregulated phase transfer catalysis system, in which the affinity of catalyst with water could be manipulated by means of altering temperature. In addition, the fluorous biphasic system [15] and the thermomorphic multicomponent solvent system (TMS) [16–18] were merged into one phase by heating during the reaction and then separated into two phases again under low temperature once the reaction was complete. Another strategy is adding additives to increase the contact opportunities between the water-soluble catalysts and the reactants, such as the addition of co-solvents [19,20], activated carbon [21], cyclodextrin [22–24] and surfactants [25,26]. There is also a thought utilizing other solvents instead of water to form liquid-liquid biphasic catalytic systems, and the solvents have large polarity to immobilize the catalysts. At the same time, the lipophilic reactants have a certain degree of solubility in the non-aqueous catalyst solution, allowing the reactions to proceed at an acceptable rate. The most common demonstration of this principle is the ionic liquid-organic biphasic system [27–29]. Recently, we reported non-aqueous biphasic hydroformylation of long-chain alkenes with polyethylene glycol instead of water, which achieved distinct phase separation with good activity maintained and realized five cycles without obvious loss of catalytic efficiency [30]. Encouraged by this work, we began to look for other polar solvents that could be used for biphasic hydroformylation. Owing to its inexpensive price, high polarity and low volatility, formamide is widely used in industry, e.g., pharmaceutical industry. Formamide could dissolve the sulfonated ligand TPPTS and the catalyst precursor HRh(CO)(TPPTS)3, and a biphasic system was formed when mixing formamide with long-chain alkenes. Herein, we described a new liquid-liquid biphasic hydroformylation system for long-chain alkenes that employed formamide as the sole solvent (Scheme 1 ). The phase behavior, catalytic performance and reusability of the system were explored. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first example of catalyst recycled for at least forty runs with activity and selectivity maintained in biphasic hydroformylation of long-chain alkenes. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Ligand TPPTS and rhodium precursor HRh(CO)(TPPTS)3 were prepared according to literatures [31]. Formamide (99.3 %) was purchased from Kelong Chemical Co. of Chengdu. 1-Octene (99.0 %) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Higher α-olefins C6, C7, C8 and C9 from the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis products were supplied by Yinuo New Materials Co., Ltd. All chemicals were used without further purification. Hydrogen (H2, 99.99 %) and carbon monoxide (CO, 99.9 %) were bought from Southwest institute. 2.2 Liquid-liquid equilibrium measurement Firstly, 8 g mixtures of 1-octene, 1-nonanal and formamide with different compositions were introduced into a 15 mL vial with a small magnetic stirrer, heated to the specified temperature in a silicone oil bath and stirred violently for 1 h. Then, stop stirring and keep the vial at a constant temperature for 1 h. Finally, the composition of each layer was analyzed by gas chromatography (PANNA A91, KB-1, 30 m ×0.25 mm ×0.50 μm, FID). 2.3 Hydroformylation experiments and catalyst recycling All hydroformylation reactions were conducted in a 25 mL stainless steel autoclave equipped with a magnetic stirrer. After loading a certain amount of HRh(CO)(TPPTS)3, TPPTS, formamide and substrate alkene, the autoclave was sealed and purged with syngas for four times, and then pressurized with syngas to the desired pressure and heated to the preset temperature for a specified time. After the reaction was stopped, the autoclave was immediately cooled to room temperature and vented. The mixture was taken out, and after 5 min, the mixture separated into an upper product phase and a lower catalyst-containing formamide phase, and the product phase was analyzed by gas chromatography (PANNA A91, KB-1, 30 m ×0.25 mm ×0.50 μm, FID). Digesting with nitric acid and perchloric acid, the amount of rhodium leaching in the product layer was determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, PerkinElmer NexION™ 350X). For cycle runs, the recovered catalyst-containing formamide phase and fresh alkene were added into the autoclave and another hydroformylation reaction was restarted. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Phase behavior study of the system 1-octene/1-nonanal/formamide It was delightful that the hydroformylation rate of long-chain alkenes was indeed greatly increased after water was replaced by formamide (Table 1 , entry 2 and 3). Subsequently, 1-octene was chose as the template substrate to further explore this system. Once the reaction was complete, two distinct phases were displayed, the bottom phase being formamide solution containing catalyst and the upper phase being products and residual reactant. In order to gain insight of the phase behavior of this non-aqueous biphasic system, we measured the mutual solubility of the solvent formamide and the reactant 1-octene. At the same time, 1-nonanal was adopted as a representative to explore the mixing behavior of 1-octene, nonanals and formamide. A liquid-liquid equilibrium curve was drawn at 25 °C and 70 °C (Fig. 1 ). The solubility of 1-octene in formamide at 25 °C was 0.06 wt%, which was about 900 times of that in water [32]. And it increased to 0.09 wt% when the temperature was raised to 70 °C, ensuring that 1-octene could have a relatively fast hydroformylation rate. The dissolution of formamide in 1-octene under 25 °C or 70 °C was below the detection range of GC (gas chromatography). Nonetheless, the content of formamide in the upper layer increased along with the enhanced 1-nonanal content. When there were only 1-nonanal and formamide, the amounts of formamide and 1-nonanal in each other phase were 3.51 wt% and 1.51 wt% respectively at 25 °C, which made it possible to separate most of the products and recover the majority of the solvent when the separation operation was performed at room temperature after the reaction was finished. Although formamide is widely used in industry, considering its toxicity and the industrial process development, after separation the residual formamide in 1-nonanal should be removed. Owing to its great water solubility, the content of formamide was lower than the detection limit of GC after washing the 1-nonanal with water. 3.2 Optimization of reaction conditions for 1-octene hydroformylation In this studied catalytic system, the hydroformylation of 1-octene mainly generates linear and branched nonanals. Other side reactions include the hydrogenation and the isomerization of 1-octene, the self-condensation of nonanals and the reaction of nonanals with formamide (Scheme S1). It can be seen that the temperature has a significant influence on this non-aqueous biphasic hydroformylation (Table 1). When the temperature increased from 60 °C to 80 °C, the conversion of 1-octene rapidly ascended from 72 % to 98 %, and the conversion would drop slightly if the temperature was above 80 °C (Table 1, entry 5 and 6). Nevertheless, the temperature increment had a detrimental effect on the selectivity towards aldehydes, which could be attributed to the increased isomerization of 1-octene, self-condensation of nonanals and the reaction of nonanals with formamide (Table 1, entries 4–6). As expected, the aggravated isomerization and ligand dissociation at high temperature lowered the L/B value [33]. Notably, the ICP-MS (inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry) measurement indicated the rhodium retention was severely impaired at high reaction temperature. This was because the water-soluble ligand TPPTS was liable to dissociate from rhodium catalyst at high temperature, so that the rhodium could not be immobilized in the formamide phase. The loss of phosphorus was much lower than that of rhodium, indicating that rhodium was mainly lost in the form of metal rather than complex. These results suggest that the strategy of using formamide instead of water to anchor the water-soluble catalyst HRh(CO)(TPPTS)3 is feasible but the temperature should be mild. When proper temperature (70 °C) was selected, good reaction activity (950 h−1) and aldehyde chemoselectivity (97 %) was obtained, and the leaching of Rh could also be reduced to a low level (0.90 wt%, Table 1, entry 2). At this temperature, the thermal stability of formamide is excellent, and the reactivity of aldehyde with formamide is also relatively poor, since there was less than 1% of aldehyde reacting with formamide after the completion of hydroformylation at 70 °C. Comprehensively considering the catalytic performance and catalyst recovery, the hydroformylation was conducted at 70 °C for following investigations. The impact of the molar ratio of TPPTS and rhodium on the reaction was described in Table 2 . It turned out that altering the ligand amount did not obviously affect the isomerization and hydrogenation of 1-octene, and the selectivity to aldehydes remained almost unchanged. In addition, when the amount of TPPTS was increased, the regioselectivity of hydroformylation was only slightly improved, whilst the rhodium leaching dramatically decreased from 6.51 wt% to 0.11 wt% as the P/Rh molar ratio ascended from 5 to 20. It reveals that excessive hydrophilic TPPTS is necessary for the reservation of rhodium in the formamide phase with high polarity, which could somehow hinder the mass transfer between rhodium catalyst and 1-octene, and this might be the reason for the conversion decline when adding more TPPTS (Table 2, entries 1–4). For the consideration of the conversion and the loss of rhodium, P/Rh molar ratio was set as 10 for the next study. The effects of the volume of formamide on hydroformylation were also investigated, and the results were listed in Table 2. The formamide volume had a remarkable accelerating effect on the conversion due to the raised dissolution of reactant in catalyst phase, and had little effect on the selectivity of aldehydes and the formation of internal octenes and 1-octane. Nevertheless, the rhodium lost in the product phase rose obviously when the formamide volume increased beyond 5 mL, which was probably due to the lower ligand concentration, and the lower L/B ratio may support this claim (Table 2, entries 5–8). Finally, we explored the effects of the syngas pressure as well as the partial pressure of H2 and CO on the hydroformylation. As summarized in Table 3 , the syngas pressure played an extremely important role in this non-aqueous biphasic catalytic system. As the syngas pressure increased, rhodium loss in the product phase increased, and the optimal conversion was achieved at 3 MPa. (Table 3, entries 1–5). While, the selectivity to aldehydes raised gradually as pressure increased and reached up to 98 % at 5 MPa (Table 3, entry 5). This phenomenon could be attributed to formation of the inactive dimer and dicarbonyl Rh-complexes at high CO pressure, which would suppress the isomerization and hydrogenation of 1-octene [34], and in turn, favored the selectivity of aldehyde. Scheme 2 illustrates the equilibria between active catalyst species HRh(CO)(TPPTS)2 (I), HRh(CO)2(TPPTS) (II) and HRh(CO)3 (III). They were generated from the dissociation of TPPTS from the catalyst precursor HRh(CO)(TPPTS)3 due to the competition of CO and TPPTS for the coordination with rhodium. When the CO partial pressure raised, the equilibrium would move from I to II, which was responsible for the formation of branched aldehydes [23,35], hence, the L/B ratio gradually decreased as the pressure ratio of CO and H2 (PCO/ P H 2 ) increased (Table 3, entries 3, 6–8). And III as an oleophyllic complex was accountable for the increased rhodium lost into upper product layer at high syngas pressure (Table 3, entry 5). In order to minimize the loss of Rh, the syngas pressure was controlled at 3 MPa. Indeed, by lowering the partial pressure of CO, the rhodium loss was notably hindered, and even dropped to 0.01 wt% when the P H 2 /PCO ratio was 5/1, which was lower than most of the biphasic hydroformylation systems for long-chain alkenes. It was gratifying that when P H 2 /PCO was 5/1, the conversion of 1-octene was similar to that when P H 2 /PCO was 1/1, but the selectivity of the aldehydes was impaired a little, induced by the more drastic hydrogenation and isomerization of 1-octene at high H2 pressure. The above results indicated that immobilizing water-soluble catalyst with formamide instead of water was a good strategy, which could suppress the loss of Rh (as low as 0.01 wt%) while maintaining a good reactivity for 1-octene hydroformylation (950 h−1). 3.3 Catalyst recycling In order to verify the practicality of the studied system, we chose 1-octene as the substrate and formamide as the polar solvent and the catalyst precursor HRh(CO)(TPPTS)3 for the catalytic cycle. After the first run was complete, the mixture was taken out and allowed to stand at room temperature for phase separation (Fig. 2 ). After 5 min, the catalyst-containing formamide phase was removed from the upper product phase just by decantation. The obtained formamide phase and fresh 1-octene were reloaded to the autoclave for the next cycle. Based on the above discussion, it is known that decreasing the partial pressure of CO and increasing the amount of TPPTS can inhibit the leaching of rhodium. To diminish the rhodium leaching, P H 2 /PCO for 5 and TPPTS/Rh for 20 were chose in the recycle runs. Taking the operational loss of rhodium and TPPTS into consideration, the amounts of HRh(CO)(TPPTS)3, formamide and substrate were doubled. As depicted in Fig. 3 , the catalytic cycle could be carried out for at least 40 times without evident decrement for the conversion and the selectivity to aldehydes, and no additional HRh(CO)(TPPTS)3 or TPPTS was introduced during this process. The selectivity to linear aldehyde was around 80 % throughout the process. The average rhodium loss measured by ICP-MS for these forty catalytic cycles was as low as 0.02 wt%, and the accumulated turnover number (∑TON) reached up to 32,428. The successful catalytic cycle experiment and metal retention proved that the use of highly polar formamide and water-soluble ligand TPPTS could adequately immobilize rhodium in formamide, insoluble with long-chain alkenes and aldehydes, thus reducing the loss of Rh greatly, while holding good catalytic activity and aldehyde selectivity. Compared with other biphasic systems, this system has the advantages of simple and cheap composition, no additives, good activity, easy separation, less rhodium loss, and more cycles. 3.4 Hydroformylation of crude Fischer-Tropsch synthesis long-chain α-olefins Recent years, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FT) has boomed in coal-to-liquids industry [36], while, the content of the sideproducts α-olefins with different carbon number can exceed 50 % depending on process. Transforming these α-olefins from FT particularly for long-chain olefins to high value-added aldehydes is of great importance from the economic and industrial view, which can broaden the product chain of FT oil and allow the coal chemical market to deeply connect with the daily chemical industry and the new material market. Crude α-olefins (e.g., 1-heptene) and some impurities with close boiling points (correspondingly heptanes and a small amount of internal heptenes and oxygen-containing compounds) can be obtained after rectification of FT products. Further separation of these mixtures is difficult and high energy-consuming, but if the olefin can be converted to aldehyde, it is readily to realize the separation owing to the great difference of the boiling points between alkane (e.g., heptane) and aldehyde (octanal) with one more carbon atom. As mentioned above, the non-aqueous biphasic system with formamide has demonstrated satisfactory performance on activity and convenient separation as well as catalyst recycling in the hydroformylation of 1-octene. Subsequently, this biphasic system was applied to the hydroformylation of FT crude long-chain α-olefins. Taking C6, C7, C8 and C9 for instance (α-olefin fraction 64.7∼81.0 %) and the results were shown in Table 4 . To our delight, these α-alkenes were successfully converted into corresponding aldehydes with high conversion (∼90 %) and aldehyde selectivity (> 90 %). The loss of rhodium was always remained at a low level with a clear interface between the yellow formamide and the colorless product phase for all these reactants. More importantly, this biphasic system has good tolerance for alkanes and oxygen-containing impurities. 4 Conclusion In conclusion, we have developed a simple, highly active and recyclable non-aqueous biphasic hydroformylation system for higher olefins based on dissolving a water-soluble catalyst in the highly polar formamide. The solubility of 1-octene in formamide is greater than that in water, so that up to 950 h−1 of TOF was found with 97 % of aldehydes selectivity, while a good phase separation was also achieved. By lowering the CO partial pressure and adding sufficient ligand, the catalyst could be reused for at least 40 times in the hydroformylation of 1-octene without the supplement of ligand or rhodium, and the rhodium leaching per cycle was only 0.02 wt%. The crude alkenes of C6 to C9 came from Fischer-Tropsch synthesis could also be smoothly hydroformylated in this biphasic system. Further research is still going on, aiming to further expand the application scope of this promising system.

        "dc:description": "A simple and recyclable biphasic rhodium catalytic system for the hydroformylation of long-chain alkenes is performed with the presence of Rh/TPPTS (trisodium tris(m-sulfophenyl)phosphine) in highly polar formamide for the first time. This work investigated the phase behavior of 1-octene, 1-nonanal and formamide, as well as the factors affecting the catalytic performance and catalyst recovery. Two phases were fully separated with distinct interface, allowing facile recycle of catalyst-containing formamide solution by decantation. Hydroformylation could be carried out under mild condition with turnover frequency and aldehyde selectivity up to 950 h−1 and 97 %, respectively. The catalyst could be reused for at least 40 runs without obvious activity and selectivity decline. No extra rhodium or TPPTS was needed during the cycle runs, and the average rhodium loss for each cycle was as low as 0.02 wt%. This system has also been successfully applied to the hydroformylation of crude higher α-olefins with high conversion and rhodium reservation, which were just distilled from Fischer-Tropsch synthesis with 64.7∼81.0 % fraction.",
