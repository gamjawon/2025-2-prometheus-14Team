Effect of MgAl2O4 on the structure, acidity as well as the catalytic performance of Nb2O5/α-Al2O3 catalyst for ethylene oxide hydration was studied using IR, XRD, NH3-TPD, CO2-TPD and catalytic reaction. Modification of α-Al2O3 support with MgAl2O4 led to an increase in both basicity and mechanical strength of the support. As a result, the density and strength of the acidity of the niobium oxide catalyst supported on the MgAl2O4 modified α-Al2O3 reduced in comparison with that supported on the pure α-Al2O3. The acidity of 10% Nb2O5/MgAl2O4/α-Al2O3 decreased with increasing loading of MgAl2O4. Catalytic test showed that EO conversion decreased monotonously with increasing MgAl2O4 loading, whereas the selectivity to MEG exhibited a maximum of 90.6% at MgAl2O4 loading of 2.23%. In terms of MEG yield, optimal MgAl2O4 loading should be around 2%. Durability test demonstrated that 10% Nb2O5/MgAl2O4/α-Al2O3 catalyst exhibited excellent stability within 1000h time-on-stream. Graphical abstract Effect of modification of α-Al2O3 support with MgAl2O4 on the structure, acidity as well as the catalytic performance of Nb2O5/α-Al2O3 catalyst for ethylene oxide hydration was studied using IR, XRD, NH3-TPD, CO2-TPD and catalytic reaction. Keywords Ethylene oxide Hydration Niobia MgAl2O4 Support Modification 1 Introduction Niobium compounds are interesting and important catalytic materials for various reactions. Hydrated niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5·nH2O), which is called niobic acid, has an acid strength corresponding to that of 70% H2SO4 when calcined at relatively low temperature (100–300°C). The acidity of niobic acid decreases with increasing calcination temperatures and becomes almost neutral after calcination at 500°C [1]. The strong acidity and high structural stability in water make niobic acid as a water-tolerant solid acid catalyst for reactions with water participation or liberation, such as dehydration, esterification and hydration of small olefins [2–6]. Also, niobic acid has been used for the ring-opening reaction of 1,2-aromatic epoxide, such as isomerization and solvolysis of phenyloxirane [7–9]. In our previous studies [10,11], the niobium oxide supported on α-Al2O3 prepared by chemical vapor deposition and impregnation was studied for hydration of ethylene oxide (EO) to produce monoethylene glycol (MEG). It was found that the yield of MEG over the supported niobium oxide calcined at 400°C was close to that of Amberlite IR, Nafion XR (6%)/SiO2 and sulfuric acid, but much higher than that of AlPO4–Cu(NO3)2 and HZSM-5. A comparison of niobic acid with the niobium oxide supported on α-Al2O3 calcined at 400°C showed that both catalysts have near 100% of EO conversion at reaction temperature of 150°C and H2O/EO ratio of 22. However, the latter gave a MEG selectivity of 89% compared with 83% that over niobic acid. The supported niobium oxide also exhibited excellent stability within 1000h time-on-stream in comparison with the niobic acid catalyst over which deactivation started after 600h. The characterizations demonstrated that the acidity of the α-Al2O3 supported niobium oxide calcined at 400°C was weaker than that of the niobic acid. A correlation of catalytic behavior with acidity indicated that the conversion of EO was proportional to the acid density, while the selectivity to MEG and durability of the catalyst decreased with increasing of the acidic strength of the catalyst. The strong acidity of the catalyst leads to the re-adsorption and secondary reaction of the primary product of MEG, resulting in a decrease of the MEG selectivity and in the formation of polymerized glycols. The accumulation of the polymerized glycols on the surface may block the acidic sites, leading to the deactivation of the catalyst. Therefore, there should be a compromise of the strength with the density of acid sites of the catalyst to achieve an optimal yield of MEG. Magnesia-alumina spinel, MgAl2O4, has remarkable chemical stability and thermal stability and thus has been used as an important catalytic material [12,13]. In this paper, MgAl2O4 was used to modify α-Al2O3 as well as the Nb2O5/α-Al2O3 catalyst. Effects of MgAl2O4 on the acid–base properties of Al2O3 and Nb2O5/α-Al2O3 catalyst and on the catalytic performance for ethylene oxide hydration were investigated. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalysts preparation The supported niobia catalysts were prepared via the following steps. Pseudo-boehmite (Condea Chemie, Pural-SB) and extruded, dried at 120°C and calcined at 1400°C under static air for 4h to form α-Al2O3 support. The α-Al2O3 was ground and sieved to pellets with 0.8–1.0mm diameter and then impregnated with an aqueous solution containing required amount of Mg(NO3)2 and Al(NO3)3, dried at 120°C and calcined at 1400°C for another 4h to form the modified MgAl2O4/α-Al2O3 support. The catalysts were prepared under vacuum by impregnating the modified MgAl2O4/α-Al2O3 support with an aqueous solution of niobic acid (Companhia Brasileira de Metalurgiae Mineracao, batch AD-2352) containing 1.8molL−1 oxalic acid. The sample was then dried at 120°C for 2h and subsequently calcined at 400°C in a quartz tube for 2h under a flow of nitrogen containing 5vol.% H2 for 2h, and finally activated at 400°C under nitrogen for another 2h. The Nb2O5/α-Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by impregnating α-Al2O3 with an aqueous solution of niobic acid as described in our previous publication [10]. 2.2 Catalyst characterization Infrared (IR) spectra of pyridine adsorption were recorded on a Nicolet Nexus 470 FT-IR spectrometer with 4cm−1 resolution. The sample disc containing catalyst and KBr with 1:1 in weight ratio was heated to 180°C and evacuated under vacuum for 4h, then cooled down to room temperature and exposed to 500Pa of pyridine vapor for 15min. The excess amount of pyridine was removed by evacuation until vacuum returned to the level of 1Pa. The spectra of adsorbed pyridine were recorded at room temperature and 150°C in vacuum. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a Rigaku D/MAX–1400 diffractometer with a Cu target, a voltage of 40kV and a current of 40mA. Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) was carried out in a flow system. The samples were pretreated under a helium flow (30mL/min) at 400°C for 1h. Ammonia (10% in helium) was adsorbed at 100°C for 1h and then the temperature was raised to 400°C at a rate of 20°C/min under a helium stream. Desorption of ammonia was monitored by thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The amount of adsorbed ammonia was absorbed with sulfuric acid solution and quantified by NaOH titration. Temperature-programmed desorption of carbon dioxide (CO2-TPD) was carried out in a flow system. The samples were pretreated under helium flow (30mL/min) at 400°C for 1h. Carbon dioxide (10% in helium) was adsorbed at room temperature for 1h and then the temperature was raised to 500°C at a rate of 20°C/min under a helium stream. The amount of desorbed carbon dioxide was detected by TCD. The analysis of niobium and iron contents in the effluent was performed on BAIRD PS-6 ICP spectrometer. Pore volume, pore diameter and surface area were measured with mercury filling method on CORETEST SYSTEMS MIS-621 apparatus. The mechanical strength (grain crushing strength) was measured with a DL-II mechanical tester manufactured by Dalian Research Institute of Chemical Engineering. The measurement was carried out on a sufficient number of grains in order to obtain reliable results. 2.3 Catalytic reaction The reaction of ethylene oxide hydration was carried out over a fixed-bed reactor with an inner diameter of 10mm and length of 300mm at temperature of 150°C, pressure of 1.5MPa, molar ratio of H2O/EO of 22 and LHSV of 30h−1. In a typical experiment, 10mL of catalyst was loaded. The products were analyzed on an HP 6890 gas chromatograph with an HP-INNOWAX column and a flame ionization detector. The quantification was made by an internal standard method using ethylene glycol monobutyl ether (EGME) as the internal standard. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structure and textural properties of α-Al2O3 support modified with MgAl2O4 XRD patterns of the α-Al2O3 support modified with different loadings of MgAl2O4 are shown in Fig. 1 . Only diffraction peaks of α-Al2O3 were observed at MgAl2O4 loading of 0.23%. The diffraction peaks with 2θ at 36.85°, 44.83° and 65.24° which are assignable to (311), (400) and (440) crystal planes of of MgAl2O4 (JCPDS No. 21-1152), respectively, were observed in the sample with the MgAl2O4 loading of 1.13%. The intensity of the MgAl2O4 peaks increased with further increasing MgAl2O4 loadings, indicating that the spinel phase MgAl2O4 was formed on the surface of α-Al2O3. Table 1 shows the effect of MgAl2O4 modification on the mechanical strength and porous properties of the α-Al2O3 support. Mechanical strength increased significantly with increasing MgAl2O4 loadings, while the pore volume, surface areas and pore diameters decreased with increasing MgAl2O4 loadings. This is easily understood because the deposition of MgAl2O4 on the inner wall of α-Al2O3 reduces the pore volume and surface area of the support. Meanwhile, the increase of wall thickness may lead to an increase of the mechanical strength of the support. 3.2 Effect of MgAl2O4 modification on the acid–base properties of α-Al2O3 Fig. 2 shows the CO2-TPD profiles of α-Al2O3 support modified with different amount of MgAl2O4, in which the signal was normalized based on unit mass. No desorption was detected when MgAl2O4 loading was below 2.23%. One broad desorption peak between 90 and 200°C was observed at the MgAl2O4 loading of 2.23%. On increasing MgAl2O4 loading up to 4.35%, two desorption peaks at 158 and 226°C appeared, indicating that two types of basic site with different strengths were formed on the modified α-Al2O3 surface. In comparison with the pure α-Al2O3 support that has no CO2-TPD peaks, it is found that the modification of α-Al2O3 with MgAl2O4 increased the basicity of the support. NH3-TPD experiment showed that no desorption of NH3 over both α-Al2O3 and MgAl2O4 modified α-Al2O3 in the temperature range studied, indicating no acidic sites on the supports. 3.3 Effect of MgAl2O4 modification on the acidity of the Nb2O5/α-Al2O3 catalysts IR spectra after pyridine adsorption and desorption at room temperature and 150°C and the NH3-TPD experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of the support modification with MgAl2O4 on the acidity of the Nb2O5/α-Al2O3 catalyst. The IR results are shown in Figs. 3 and 4 . The absorptions at ∼1610 and ∼1450cm−1 were assigned to pyridine adsorbed on Lewis acid sites (LAS), and the absorption at 1550cm−1 accompanied by other peaks near 1640–1620cm−1 was assigned to pyridine adsorbed on Brønsted acid sites (BAS). The wavenumber of the band around 1610cm−1 gives information about the strength of LAS, and the intensity of the band at ∼1450cm−1 is related to the number of LAS [14,15]. Fig. 3 shows the spectra after pyridine desorption at room temperature. No IR absorption band was observed for α-Al2O3 support. For the Nb2O5/α-Al2O3 and Nb2O5/MgAl2O4/α-Al2O3 catalysts, only the band around 1445cm−1 was observed. For niobic acid, however, absorption bands at 1632 and 1536cm−1 corresponding to pyridine species bound to BAS and bands at 1605, 1574, 1485 and 1444cm−1 corresponding to pyridine species bound to LAS were clearly observed. After evacuation at 150°C the absorption at ca. 1444cm−1 disappeared for both Nb2O5/α-Al2O3 and Nb2O5/MgAl2O4/α-Al2O3 catalysts as shown in Fig. 4. However, for niobic acid the bands at 1636, 1608, 1574, 1537, 1487 and 1444cm−1 still appeared. The IR experiments indicate that the surface of α-Al2O3 was nearly neutral, in accordance with the CO2-TPD experiment. Niobic acid demonstrated both Brønsted and Lewis acidities. In contrast, Nb2O5 supported on α-Al2O3 and on MgAl2O4 modified α-Al2O3 were found to have only Lewis acidic sites. FT-IR could not give any valuable information on the strength of acidity effected by MgAl2O4, as no absorption bands were registered at ca. 1610cm−1 region [14] for both Nb2O5/α-Al2O3 and Nb2O5/MgAl2O4/α-Al2O3 catalysts. However, it is clear that the acidity of Nb2O5 supported either on α-Al2O3 or on the MgAl2O4 modified α-Al2O3 was much weaker than that of the niobic acid. Fig. 5 shows the NH3-TPD profiles of Nb2O5/MgAl2O4/α-Al2O3 catalysts with different MgAl2O4 loadings. Only one broad desorption peak was observed in all the catalysts. The temperature of the desorption peak shifted from 285°C of unpromoted Nb2O5/α-Al2O3 (not shown) to 283 and 269°C with increasing MgAl2O4 loadings from 0.23% to 4.35%, respectively. This indicates that mainly weak acidic sites existed on the surface of Nb2O5/MgAl2O4/α-Al2O3 and the strength of acidity of the catalysts decreased with increasing MgAl2O4 loadings. The concentration of acidic centers of the catalysts with MgAl2O4 loadings of 0, 0.23, 1.13, 2.23, and 4.35wt.% determined by NaOH titration of desorbed NH3 were 161,157, 147, 129 and 109μmol/g, respectively. The decrement of the acid density with increasing the loading of MgAl2O4 may be caused by the basic nature of MgAl2O4 as observed by CO2-TPD, as MgAl2O4 may partially neutralize the acidic sites of niobium oxide adhered to it. 3.4 Effect of MgAl2O4 loadings on the catalytic performance Fig. 6 shows the effect of MgAl2O4 loadings on the catalytic performance of Nb2O5/MgAl2O4/α-Al2O3 for EO hydration. EO conversion decreased with the addition of MgAl2O4 and with increasing the loading of MgAl2O4 in the range studied, e.g. it decreased from 99.8% of unpromoted Nb2O5/α-Al2O3 to 99.5% at MgAl2O4 loading of 2.23%. The selectivity to MEG was slightly increased with MgAl2O4 loadings below 2.23%, and achieved a maximum of 90.6% at MgAl2O4 loading of 2.23% in comparison with that of 89.8% for the pure α-Al2O3 supported catalyst. On further increasing the MgAl2O4 loadings above 2.23%, MEG selectivity decreased noticeably. In order to better understand the influence of support modification on MEG selectivity, additional experiment was carried out, in which the reaction temperature was raised by 5°C for 10% Nb2O5/2.23% MgAl2O4/α-Al2O3 catalyst to keep the EO conversion same as that over 10% Nb2O5/α-Al2O3 catalyst. The results showed that at the same EO conversion of 99.8% the MEG selectivity over 10% Nb2O5/2.23% MgAl2O4/α-Al2O3 and 10% Nb2O5/α-Al2O3 catalysts were 90.7% and 89.8%, respectively. The decrement of EO conversion with increasing MgAl2O4 loading may be interpreted by the decreasing of acid density as observed by NH3-TPD, because the catalytic activity of acid catalyzed hydration is proportional to the density of the active acidic sites. The reason for the maximum MEG selectivity appearing at MgAl2O4 loading of 2.23% may be explained as follows. Depending on the reaction conditions and the catalyst used, the primary product of hydration may preferentially desorbs from the active sites or remains on the active sites. If the primary product desorbs from the catalyst surface, the MEG would be produced; if the MEG remains on active sites, the polymerization or other secondary reactions possibly occur, and thus the selectivity to MEG would decrease. It is generally accepted that under the same reaction conditions the higher strength of acidity may favor the adsorption of MEG. As the acidity strength of the catalyst decreases with increasing the loading of MgAl2O4 up to 2.23%, the adsorption of the primary product of MEG becomes weaker. Hence, the selectivity to MEG increases. When the acidity strength of the catalyst decreases further by further increasing the loading of MgAl2O4 from 2.23%, the contribution of non-catalytic hydration to the overall reaction and to total products would increase. Therefore, the selectivity to MEG decreases, as the selectivity of non-catalytic hydration is known to be significantly lower than that of the acid catalyzed hydration. The above results indicated that modification of α-Al2O3 with certain amount of MgAl2O4 led to a compromise between the strength and density of the acidity of Nb2O5/MgAl2O4/α-Al2O3 that gives rise to an optimal catalytic performance. 3.5 Stability of supported niobium oxide catalyst Durability test of the Nb2O5/MgAl2O4/α-Al2O3 catalyst was carried out over a period of 1000h, as shown in Fig. 7 . The selectivity of MEG remained almost unchanged at ca. 91% within 1000h time-on-stream and no deactivation was observed during testing. The effluent was monitored with ICP to check whether there is the elution of niobia species or iron species of stainless steel reactor. No iron or niobia ion was found within the detection limit of 10−6 g/mL. This shows that the niobium oxide supported on MgAl2O4 modified α-Al2O3 had no leaching and no corrosion to the stainless reactor under harsh hydrothermal circumstance during EO hydration. 4 Conclusions Modification of α-Al2O3 support with MgAl2O4 led to an increase in basicity and mechanical strength of the support. The catalyst prepared with MgAl2O4 modified α-Al2O3 support showed less density and strength of acidity than that of the pure α-Al2O3 supported catalyst. The acidity of the Nb2O5/MgAl2O4/α-Al2O3 decreased with increasing loading of MgAl2O4 and was much weaker than that of niobic acid. Catalytic test demonstrated that EO conversion decreased monotonously with increasing loading of MgAl2O4, whereas the selectivity to MEG showed a maximum of 90.6% at MgAl2O4 loading of 2.23%. In terms of MEG yield, optimal MgAl2O4 loadings should be around 2%. Durability test demonstrated that Nb2O5/MgAl2O4/α-Al2O3 catalyst exhibited excellent stability within 1000h time-on-stream. The present investigation showed that there should be a compromise of the strength with density of the acidity of the catalyst to achieve the optimal catalytic performance.
