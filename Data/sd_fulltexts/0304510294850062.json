Herein are presented some basic properties of these materials obtained by TPR and TPO experiments, HZ and CO chemisorption, TEM examination, XPS and EXAFS studies. The use of organic precursors led to very small Ru particles, with a coordination number between Ru atoms of 4.35 (Ru -Ruo+Ru -Rus+). The size of the metallic particles was not modified by adding Ge, Sn or Ph by the controlled surface reaction technique. In very small aggregates, some Ru atoms (1015%) remained partially oxidised even after reduction at 623 K in flowing hydrogen. During the coimpregnation of alumina with inorganic precursors, the modifier played the role of a nucleation center for Ru, thus allowing small particles to be formed. We believe that CO could modify the surface composition of small bimetallic RuGe particles during the chemisorption. Key words: alumina; bimetallic catalysts; ruthenium; supported catalysts 1. Introduction This series of papers will describe the results obtained in the course of studies performed in the above-named laboratories, supported by an EC Stimulation Action 108 B. Cog et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 92 (1994)107-121 Programme. The project is entitled \"The Evaluation of some Catalytic and Structural Properties of Ruthenium Bimetallic Catalysts\", and has the following objectives. (1) To identify the location of the two components (Ru and Ge, Sn or Ph) on the surface of bimetallic particles. (2) To obtain better control over the course of a catalytic reaction by modifying the surface of the active component (Ru) with atoms of an inactive component (Ge, Sn, Pb). (3) To provide information concerning the influence of the method used to prepare the catalytic precursor on the structure and reactivity of the final catalyst. The programme aimed to extend and amplify earlier work [ 1 ] which suggested that in bimetallic RuM particles, Sn and Pb atoms occupy specifically sites of low coordination number, whereas Ge atoms have not a so definite preference. These modifiers lower the activity of the Ru for structure-sensitive reactions such as alkane hydrogenolysis, but there are also changes observed in product selectivities, reflecting alterations in the manner in which the reactant alkane molecules are preferentially chemisorbed [ 2 ] . Similar changes have been observed with the hydrogenation of polyfunctional molecules [ 3 ] . To achieve these goals, different and complementary approaches have been followed by laboratories at the Universities of Montpellier (MTP), Messina (MES ) and Saragossa (SAR), and at Brunel University (UXB). They can be summarised as follows: (1) The programme of work at Brunel University falls into two parts: (i) physical characterization of the catalysts by XPS and TEM, and (ii) study of the kinetics of alkane hydrogenolysis to provide a deeper understanding of how the modifiers function. (2) The contribution of Messina is twofold: (i) preparation and characterization of bimetallic Ru catalysts by classical impregnation methods with inorganic precursors; and (ii) evaluation of the behaviour of the model bimetallic systems prepared in MTP and MES towards the hydrogenation of unsaturated compounds in gas and liquid phases, especially towards the selective hydrogenation of the carbonyl function in compounds containing other functional groups [ 3 ] . (3) At Saragossa, EXAFS experiments are being carried out to ascertain: (i) the surface concentrations of both elements in bimetallic aggregates; (ii) the distribution, between the sites of different topology, of these two elements in the surface layer; and (iii) structure of some adsorbed species. (4) The work followed in MTP is mainly concerned with two points: (i) preparation and some characterization of bimetallic Ru catalysts using organometallic precursors and the controlled surface reaction technique [4,5]; and (ii) identification of the distribution of the added modifier between the different surface sites of RuM particles by using 2,2,3,3-tetramethylbutane (TeMB) hydrogenolysis [ 1 ] , IR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO and quantum chemical B. Coq et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 92 (1994) 107-121 109 calculations on model bimetallic clusters [ 6 ] . This theoretical study is being performed with the use of the LCGTO-MP-LSD method [ 7 ] which has provided reliable results for transition metal clusters. Given the experience gained from our previous work on RhSn and RhGe aggregates [ 6 ] , we have chosen to split the study of the Sn and Ge segregation in Ru clusters into two complementary parts: (a) analysis of the preferred site for bonding a Sn or Ge atom, i.e., a low or high coordination site, (b) study of the effect of dilution of Sn and Ge atoms among Ru atoms of the surface. In this first part, we present information on the methods of preparation and characterization employed, and on the results obtained concerning the chemical composition and physical structures of the catalysts. In the ensuing parts, we shall have frequent recourse to the information this paper contains, as we shall not wish to repeat at length what can readily be found here: this information will prove invaluable in aiding the construction of models to rationalise the catalytic behaviour of our materials. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation of the catalysts from organic precursors (MTP) Monometallics. The catalysts were prepared from y-A1203 (Rh6ne Poulenc, particle size: 62-125 li,m, SBET = 220 m2 . g-', Cl < 20 ppm) and ruthenium acetylacetonate (Ru(acac)3, Heraeus), by ligand exchange according to procedures described by Boitiaux et al. [8] for Pd/A1203 catalysts. A toluene or tetrahydrofuran solution of Ru (acac) 3 (1 g/45 ml) was contacted with the dehydrated support for 72 h, after which time the ligand exchange was complete: the solution was either filtered (in the case of the precursor to RuEC 1) , or the solvent was evaporated (in the case of the precursor to RuEC2 and RuEC3). After drying under vacuum at 333 K the resulting solids were first dried under N2 for 2 h at 523 K (0.5 cm 3 . g- ` . s-', ramp: 1 K - min-' ), and then reduced under different conditions (Table 1) . Bimetallics. The monometallic RuECI and RuEC3 were used as a basis for the bimetallic formulations. The second metal was introduced as tetra-n-butyl tin (Merck, purity > 98%), tetraaethyl lead (Alfa Products) or tetra-n-butyl germanium (Alfa Products). These organometallic compounds were dissolved in nheptane (Fluka, purity > 99%) . The bimetallic RuM/A1203 samples were prepared by contacting in situ a Ru/ A1203 parent catalyst, prereduced at 623 K, with the desired amount of tetra-alkylM in n-heptane solution. The contolled surface reaction [ 1,4,5] was carried out under a H2 atmosphere at 353 K with a solid/liquid ratio of 1 g/3 cm3. The solid 110 B.

Preparation of catalysts from inorganic precursors (MES) Monometallics. An aqueous solution of Ru nitrosyl nitate (Johnson Matthey), or Ru trichloride (Johnson Matthey) was contacted with the y-A1203 (Rh6ne Poulenc); the amount of solution used was slightly greater than the pore volume of the support. After drying for 2 h at 393 K in air, the solids were reduced in Hz (2 cm' - g -1 ' min -1) from room temperature to 623 K (ramp: 10 K ' min -1) , then for 3 h at 623 K. Afterward, the samples were cooled to room temperature in flowing H2. B. Coq et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 92 (1994) 107-121 111 Bimetallics. In the case of the bimetallics, either an alcoholic solution of germanium ethoxide (Aldrich, purity > 99.5%), or an aqueous solution of SnC12 (Riedel de Haen, purity > 97%) , lead acetate (Aldrich, purity > 99.95 %) , or SnS04 (Fluka, purity > 96%), was added to the aqueous solution of Ru nitrosyl nitrate. The other steps of the preparation remained the same as for the monometallic samples. 2.3. Temperature programmed studies (UXB, MES, MTP) TPR and TPO (temperature programmed reduction or oxidation) were carried out in order to establish the state of the catalyst at different stages of the preparation. For TPR measurements a 5% HZ/Ar mixture was used and for TPO a 6% 02/He mixture, and samples were usually heated to 773 K or 873 K at of 5 K - min-'. The H2 or 02 consumption was measured using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), placed after a cold trap, and in the case of TPO the product gas mixture was passed through a KOH trap for containing C02. The peak areas were calibrated using pulses of H2, 02 or Ar, and results were recorded and processed with a microcomputer system: reduction of NiO showed that the error in the measured amounts of consumed H2 was much less than 10%. In some cases a mass spectrometer was placed in line to identify some of the effluents. 2.4. Chemisorption of hydrogen and of carbon monoxide (MES, MTP) The double isotherm method proposed by Goodwin et al. [9] was used for H2 chemisorption in a static volumetric apparatus: the sample was reactivated at 623 K under flowing H2 overnight, and after outgassing at 623 K the first isotherm was obtained at 373 K in the 0-20 kPa range. On completion of the first isotherm the sample was evacuated for 30 min at the same temperature and a second isotherm then carried out under the same conditions. Contrary to the protocol followed by Yang and Goodwinn [ 9 ] , the H2 chemisorption was carried out at 373 K because, for very small particles, the achievement of equilibrium, after each H2 introduction, is much faster (30 min) than when carried out at 298 K (3-4 h). Chemisorption of CO has been performed using a conventional pulse system operating at room temperature. After reduction under flowing H2 at 623 K, a stream of He was passed over the sample and then through a thermal conductivity detector (TCD): after this step, a known amount of CO was injected into the He stream passing over the sample. The CO not adsorbed was measured by the TCD. The difference between the amount injected and that recorded is due to the chemisorption of CO on the catalyst. 2.5. Electron microscopy (MTP) Selected samples were prepared for TEM using the extractive replica technique and were examined with a JEOL I OOCX apparatus. 112 B. Coq et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 92 (1994)107-121 2.6. EXAFS experiments (SAR) EXAFS spectra at the Ru K-edge were measured at L.U.R.E. (Orsay, France) in the beam line XAFS 4; the storage ring D.C.I. was operating at 1.85 GeV with an average beam current of 250 mA. The radiation was monochromatized using a double Si (311) crystal, and the absorption spectra were recorded in the transmission mode at room temperature. Two sets of experiments were performed: i) with the catalysts as prepared after exposure to air and ii) with the catalysts reduced insitu by flowing Hz at 723 K for 1 h, the reduction process being monitored by EXAFS. As reference materials, the precursor Ru(acac),,/A1203 and ruthenium powder were used. Sample thickness was approximately of 10 mm, optimized in order to get the best signal to noise ratio. 2.7. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (UXB) The catalysts were studied using a VG Escalab 210 photoelectron spectrometer: during the measurements the vacuum was usually better than 10- I Torr. A correction for steady state charging (typically 4-6 eV) was made using the Al 2p line (74.70 eV in A1203). Attached to this system was a small-volume pretreatment chamber, through which a gas (H2, N2, air) could be passed at atmospheric pressure; this chamber could be heated up to 873 K. 3. Results In the following, the methods will be exemplified by reference to the RuECI sample and a table will show the main characteristics of all the catalysts. 3.1. Activation and pretreatments TPR was first performed on the Ru(acac),/A1203 precursor after drying under vacuum at 333 K before any heat treatment. A peak was observed at 553 K, with corresponding peaks due to CH3+, CH4+ and CH3C0+ being observed in the quadrupole analyser. This is probably due to the reduction of acetyl acetonate ligands. There was also a large increase in HZ consumption at 673 K and above, which coincided with peaks due to CH4+and CH3+. This peak is also thought to be caused by the reduction of a carbon-containing species on the catalyst surface. Therefore, the decomposition of anchored Ru(acac)x moities on alumina to Ru is complete by treatment at 573 K under H2. Fig. 1 shows TPR profiles of RuEC 1 after different activation treatments. After reduction at 623 K and storing under ambient conditions for 2-3 months, TPR shows (Fig. la) two main peaks of HZ consumption, at 388 K and 613 K. From an experiment in which the gas from the outlet was analysed mass spectrometrically, it was concluded that the first peak B. Cog et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 92 (1994) 107-121 113 could be assigned to the reduction of ruthenium oxide, whereas during the second peak mainly C02 and CH4 were found, probably originating from reduction of a carbonaceous compound present on the catalyst. It is interesting to note that when the RuECl sample is reduced in situ overnight at 623 K before TPR no peaks are observed at T < 623 K and only a small HZ consumption was observed at higher temperatures (Fig. lb); methane was never detected during this experiment. In order to verify that the peak observed in TPR at 388 K (Fig. la) is due to the reduction of Ru02, the sample used in TPR was oxidized in situ at 773 K with air taken from a gas cylinder. The TPR carried out on this sample (Fig. lc) shows the presence of several peaks, all below 473 K, and the value of HZ/Ru was 2.1. This confirms the formation, after exposure to air, of Ru02. The different shapes of the low temperature TPR peaks (Figs. la and lc) is likely to be due to the different (d) (c) A c 0 a E 3 N C JL___ O V C N 07 O (b) x (a) 273 373 473 573 673 773 Temperature (K) Fig. 1.

The reduction temperature (first peak) shifted to lower temperatures at higher Ru loadings. The Ge catalysts suffered a high degree of oxidation (80-100%) based on the area of the first peak. The reduction of Ge02 could not be observed, because it is expected to be reduced partially, and then only at temperatures as high as that of the carbonaceous compound or even higher. The Sn and Ph doped catalysts showed a high H2 consumption in the first peak (90-100% degree of oxidation) and only a low consumption at higher temperatures. 3.2. Chemisorption Fig. 2 shows an example of a H2 chemisorption isotherm obtained with the RuECl catalyst. The first isotherm (Fig. 2a) represents the direct chemisorption of H2 after outgassing the sample at 623 K. The second, or back, isotherm (Fig. 2b) was obtained after evacuation for 30 min at 373 K. Good linear regions were observed with all isotherms. Table 3 presents for all the samples the H2/Ru ratio extrapolated at zero pressure based on the first isotherm ((H/Ru)to,) and on the difference between the two isotherms ((H/Ru)iR). The values of CO chemisorption are also reported in Table 3. 116 B. Coq et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 92 (1994)107-121 3.3. Transmission electron microscopy Fig. 3 presents TEM pictures for four samples: RuECI, RuECIGe3, RuNIl and RuNIIGel. These pictures call forth three comments. (i) For the same Ru content and procedure of activation, the catalysts prepared from Ru(acac)3 are generally more homogeneous in particle size than those obtained from Ru nitrosyl nitrate. (ii) For the bimetallic catalysts prepared from organic precursors, the size of the particles is not significantly modified compared to that of the pure Ru particles in the parent catalyst RuECl. This behaviour was expected from the second metal loading and the method used to introduce it [ 1 ] . General observations concerning the TEM pictures and particle size distributions for the different catalysts are given in Table 3. (iii) It would appear that a major effect of Ge and possibly the other second metals is to aid the dispersion of the ruthenium when the material is prepared by co-impregnation of the inorganic precursors. 3.4. EXAFS experiments The experimental EXAFS signal has been extracted from the raw spectra using standard methods [ 10 ] . Background removal was performed and the atomic absorption coefficient was determined by a low order polynomial fit of the spectra. In Fig. 4 the moduli of the Fourier Transform of the Ru K edge EXAFS spectra of RuECl after in situ reduction and after exposure to air for two months are compared with the precursor Ru(acac)x/A1203 and Ru metal, respectively. As observed in Fig. 4a the Ru in the air-exposed catalyst is almost totally reoxidized, the peak of the first shell contribution coinciding with that of the precursor and corresponding to a Ru-O bond (2.0 A). After reduction a new peak appears at 2.0 A, corresponding, when corrected for the Ru phase shifts, to a Ru-Ru interatomic distance (2.604 A) smaller than that of the bulk value (2.677 A). This peak is very small compared with that of Ru metal, indicating the low coordination number for Ru in this catalyst. The first shell contribution has been isolated by Fourier filtering of the spectra. The spectra have been analyzed by curve fitting, using as model both the Ru metal and the Ru(acac)x/A1203 spectra. The best fit results for the coordination numbers and interatomic distances obtained, including two shells contributions, are reported in Table 4. The low value of the coordination numbers indicates that the Ru particles are very small, probably around 1 nm. Moreover, some Ru atoms are oxidized and some oxygen atoms are bonded to the particles. The coordination numbers are very close to those reported by Vlaic et al. [ 11 ] on a 1 %Ru/A1203 catalyst prepared from Ru (acac) 3 and activated under similar conditions. 3.5. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (UXB) Fig. 5 gives some typical XPS results corrected for static charging using the Al 2p peak (at 74.70 eV).

The overlap with C is complicates both the determination of the exact peak positions and the quantification of the Ru peak areas. The carbon can be removed by oxidation at 623 K for 1 H, followed by a reduction at 753 K (2 h); the Ru 3d peaks are found at 278.8 and 282.9 eV (see Fig. Sa). This is indicative of Ru [ 12 ] . Because the oxidation treatment leads to an increase in particle size, alternatively the Ru 3p peaks were used (Ru 3p312 at 460.3 eV for the reduced catalyst) for quantification purposes. In the catalysts containing Ge, the Ge 2p peaks ( at 1220.4 and 1251.5 eV for the catalyst \"as received\") have been used, as is shown in Fig. Sb for catalyst RuEC1Ge3. The peak positions suggest that Ge02 is present in these materials [13].

Discussion The main object of this paper is to present some basic characteristics of catalysts prepared through this European collaboration, and therefore mainly some specific points dealing with the RuECl sample will be discussed, except when the contrary is stated. One of the most important points is the temperature at which the catalysts need to be activated. Under TPR conditions ( 5% H2 in Ar, 1 K ~ min- t ramp) the decomposition of Ru(acac),/A1203to Ru /A1203 is complete by 553 K. It appears that catalysts prepared from the organic precursor have some carbonaceous residues strongly adsorbed on the surface, but these can be removed either at 723 K under TPR conditions, or at 623 K by flowing pure HZ overnight. Exposure of Ru/Al203 to air at room temperature for a prolonged period leads to the formation of Ru02, but this oxidation is limited to the outermost layers, and RuEC2 and RuEC3 are in 120 B. Coq et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 92 (1994)107-121 fact only partially oxidised. The Ru oxide formed needs, in the TPR experiments, a temperature of about 360-400 K for complete reduction. After exposure to air for only 12 h, Ru/A1203 chemisorbs oxygen which can however be easily removed at low temperature. Therefore, catalysts reduced at 623 K under pure HZ can suffer short exposure to air, for transfer to another apparatus, and can be easily reactivated at low temperature under H2. For the RuECl sample, even though there is no more H2 consumption after activation under H2 overnight at 623 K, the EXAFS results show the existence of Rus+ species, the amount of which estimated to be 10-15%. It has not been possible to postulate a definitive structure for the Ru aggregates in RuEC 1; however, due to the low coordination number Ru -Ru (CN = 3.81) and the presence of a Ru -Rus+ contribution (CN=0.54), it seems likely that the Ru aggregates are very small and composed of no more than 10-15 atoms. The formation of a monolayer raft is less probable, due to the low Ru-0 contribution (CN = 0.31) . This is in agreement with the previous conclusions from Vlaic et al. [ 11 ] for very similar catalysts. The size of such particles will be around 0.8-1 nm which is nicely in line with the TEM pictures. Assuming unity for the H/Rus chemisorption stoichiometry, this means that the H/Rut., should also be about unity. We found a value of 0.88 from the first isotherm alone (Fig. 2), so we conclude that the double isotherm method proposed by Yang and Goodwin [ 8 ] at 293 K is not well suited when chemisorption is performed at 373 K. Taking the difference between the first and the back isotherms and assuming an H/Rus of unity, the H/Ru;r, value for RuECl would be only 0.71, which appears too low for a such fully dispersed catalyst. It appears that the amount of CO chemisorbed is generally greater than that of H2. The ratio between CO/Ru and (H/Ru)tot varies between 1.2 and 1.6 on monometallic samples (RuCl excepted). The highest values are obtained when there are small metallic particles with the homogeneous RuEC1, and with RuNIl, which shows a bimodal particle size distribution. Such a behaviour could be ascribed to the occurrence of multicarbonyl species bonded on low coordination sites, or disruption of small particles after corrosive CO chemisorption [14]. Actually, the most intriguing point comes from the higher (CO/Ru)/(H/Ru) values obtained on the bimetallic catalysts: starting from a value of 1.49 on RuECI, this ratio reaches 2.0 on RuECIGel and 2.85 on RuEClGe3. There is no report claiming that Ge can chemisorb CO, so we guess that, due to the higher affinity of CO for Ru than for Ge, the latter is removed from the surface, leaving all Ru atoms free for CO chemisorption; the absolute CO /Ru value does not change very much from RuEC 1 to the doped RuEC 1 Ge samples. IR spectroscopic studies and EXAFS experiments are in progress to clarify this point. 5. Conclusions The main conclusions are the following: (1) For catalysts prepared from organic precursors, very small Ru particles could be obtained and the use of the CSR technique allowed us to obtain bimetallic B. Coq et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 92 (1994) 107-121 121 samples with very similar size of metallic particles. In the case of bimetallic catalysts prepared from inorganic precursors, during the coimpregnation the modifier acted as a nucleation centre for Ru. (2) Very small Ru particles are sensitive to air, which transforms them to Ru02 aggregates. Even after activation at 623 K under flowing 112, 10-15% of partially oxidised Ru atoms remain in the particles. EXAFS experiments show both Ru Rus+ and Ru-0 contributions. These very small Ru particles are formed of no more than 10-15 atoms. A raft like structure is less probable due to the low Ru-0 contribution in EXAFS spectrum. (3) When comparing CO/Ru with H/Ru ratios from chemisorption experiments, it appears that the HZ uptake decreases upon Ge addition whereas the CO uptake does not. It is speculated that CO could remove Ge atoms from the outermost layer of the bimetallic particles leaving Ru atoms free for CO chemisorption. References [ 1 ] B. Coq, A. Bittar, R. Dutartre and F.
