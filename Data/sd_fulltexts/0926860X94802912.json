Box 1414, 26500 Patras, Greece Received 16 February 1994; revised 29 April 1994; accepted 29 April 1994 Abstract In order to elucidate the influence on the hydrodesulphurization (HDS) activity of the order of deposition of F- ions on CoMo/y-A1203-F catalysts, we prepared, characterized (using BET, NO chemisorption, DRS and XPS) and determined the HDS activity (at atmospheric pressure and various temperatures using the HDS of thiophene as model reaction) of four samples. Specifically, we prepared one undoped CoMo/y-Al203 catalyst (denoted as MC) and three fluorinated catalysts in which the F-ions were deposited before (FMC), after (MCF) and simultaneously with the Mo w and Co u phases ((MCF)). All the specimen which were prepared contained a fixed amount of Mo ( 11.5 wt.- % MOO3), Co (3.5 wt.-% Co304) and F (0.8 wt.-% F). It was found that a change in the deposition order provoked a change in the specific surface area, in the dispersity of the supported Mo and Co species and in the intrinsic activity of each HDS active site. The last change was found to be related to the ratio Mo(octahedral)/Mo(tetrahedral). Moreover, it was inferred that fluorination increased the number of active sites per unit active surface. The above explained the changes in the density of the HDS active sites, in the number of these sites and finally on the HDS activity which follows the order MCF> FMC > MC > (MCF) in all temperatures studied. Finally, an attempt was made to convincingly develop pictures related to the preparation which explain the influence of the F doping on the specific surface area and dispersity of the Mo and Co supported species.

Introduction It is known that CoMo/T-AI203 and NiMo/y-A1203 catalysts, used for many years in the hydrotreatment of petroleum fractions, are not sufficiently active when *Corresponding author. 0926-860X/94/$07.00 1994 Elsevier Science B.V.

Matralis et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 221-236 an exhaustive removal of the S, N and O heteroatoms has to be achieved from heavy petroleum fractions as well as from fractions derived from the upgrading of synthetic fuels [ 1-3 ]. An increase in the reaction temperature is not a suitable way to increase catalytic activity because these catalysts are sensitive to fouling by coke formation. This justifies the efforts undertaken during the last decade to develop more active and more resistant CoMo/y-AI203 and NiMo/~/-A1203 catalysts. The modification of these catalysts by several dopants is a promising method in order for the fore-mentioned development to be achieved. Of all the dopants tested fluoride ions have been found to be the most promising [ 4-25 ]. However, it has been realised that the promotional action of the F- ions strongly depends on various parameters; the most important are the fluoride content, the type of the hydrotreat- ment reaction and the order of deposition of the F- ions during the preparation of the catalysts [4,10,14-19,21 ]. The elucidation of F- promotion on both CoMo/y-AlzOsand NiMo/y-A12Os catalysts was the purpose of research undertaken in our laboratory some years ago [ 10,15-18,21,24,25 ]. This was mainly attempted by an extensive physicochemical characterization of fluorinated CoMo/y-A1203 and NiMo/y-Al2Os catalysts both in their oxidic and sulfided states. Concerning the fluorinated CoMo/y-AI203 catalysts, our efforts were focused on the study of the influence of the fluoride content on the physicochemical properties as well as on the HDS and isomerization activity. It was found that doping with small amounts of F- ions (0.3, 0.8 wt.-% F) decreased the specific surface area and the extent of cobalt sulphidation. On the other hand this doping increased the density of active sites and the dispersity of the supported Mo and Co species, as well as the concentration of conconIzAlz_zO4 surface spinel and/or the octahedral cobalt incorporated into the polymerized Mo vl species. Finally, doping with these amounts of F- ions increased the hydrodesul- phurization activity estimated by the HDS of thiophene at atmospheric pressure and various temperatures. In contrast, doping with higher amounts of F- ions (2.0 wt.-% F) caused a decrease in the density of active sites and the dispersity of the Mo and Co supported species related to the formation of bulk oxides (C0304, CoO, MOO3) and sulfides (C09S8, MoS2). Consequently, doping with this loading caused a decrease in the catalytic activity. Although the influence of the F- content on the HDS activity is mainly attributed to the modification which the fluorination causes on the density of active sites by altering the specific surface area and dispersity, a more direct interaction of the F- ions with the active phase may also play a significant role as has been shown in recent work [24]. In fact, this work, devoted to the influence of fluorination on the HDS activity of the unsupported MoS 2 phase, showed that the F- ions may affect either the catalytic activity per active site or their surface density by direct interaction with the MoS 2 phase. Finally, it was found that fluorination does not change the isomerization activity. Recently, Sarbak and Andersson [ 23 ] studied the effect of metal-organic com- pounds (such as nickel- and vanadium-naphthenates) on thiophene hydrodesul- phurization over sulfided F-containing CoMo/A1203 catalysts with F- loadings in H. Matralis et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 221-236 the range 0.05 to 0.2 F/AI atomic ratio. They reported that F-modified samples exhibited lower HDS activity compared to the undoped CoMo/A1203 and, more- over, that the activity decreased as the F- content increased. In addition they found that for metal naphthenates free F-CoMo/A1203 (with atomic ratio F/A1 = 0.1 ) the order of adding fluorine, and cobalt and molybdenum salts during preparation resulted in only minor differences in activity. These results corroborate our previous findings, namely that small amounts of F- ions enhance the HDS catalytic activity of the CoMo/AI203 catalysts, whereas higher F loadings deactivate the catalysts [ 17 ]. Indeed, in this study we found that the maximum promotion in HDS activity was achieved for an F loading corresponding to F/AI = 0.025 whereas deactivation already occurred from F/Al=0.065 in accordance with Sarbak and Andersson [ 23 ]. Concerning the influence of the order of F- deposition on the final HDS activity these authors studied it using a fluoride loading of F/A1 = 0.1 which deac- tivates the CoMo/A1203 catalyst. It seems to us more interesting to investigate whether it is possible to further improve the performance of fluorinated CoMo/ A1203 catalysts by varying the order of F- deposition using a F loading which actually enhances the catalytic activity. This investigation is the purpose of the present work. In particular we attempted to answer the following questions. Has the deposition order of an optimal amount of F- ions (F/Al=0.025) during preparation any detectable effect on HDS activity? Are there changes in the number of active sites and/or the activity per active site which determine the fore-mentioned effect? Is the effect of the deposition order, if any, on the number of active sites due to its influence on the density of active sites, on the specific surface area, or on both parameters? How does the deposition order influence the density of active sites; by affecting the dispersity of Mo and Co supported phases? Finally, how does the deposition order affect this dispersity and the specific surface area? In order to investigate these points we prepared, characterised and determined the HDS activity of four samples; one undoped and three fluorinated catalysts in which the F- ions were deposited before, after and simultaneously with the Mo and Co phases. All specimens which were prepared contained fixed amounts of Mo (11.5 wt.-% MOO3) , Co (3.5 wt.-% C0304) and F (0.8 wt.-% F). 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation of catalysts All the prepared catalysts contained fixed amounts of Mo ( 11.5 wt.-% MOO3) and Co (3.5 wt.-% Co304). The F-modified samples also contained a constant loading of fluorine equal to 0.8 wt.-% F and corresponding to F/AI =0.025. The carrier was T-AI203 (Houdry Ho415, 120 m z g-l, 100-150 mesh). Mo v~ was deposited by three successive dry impregnations with aqueous solutions ( pH = 5.5 ) H. Matralis et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 221-236 of (NH4)6Mo7024\" 6H20 (Riedel de Haen). Cobalt and fluorine were introduced by incipient wettness impregnation with aqueous solutions of Co(NO3)z\" 6HzO (Riedel de Haen) and NH4F (Carlo Erba), respectively. F- ions were introduced before Mo ( sample denoted as FMC ), or after Co ( sample MCF) or simultaneously with Mo and Co (sample (MCF)); in this last case three successive coimpregna- tions (pH = 6.2) were used. With the exception of the coimpregnated sample, cobalt was added after the deposition of Mo (samples MC, MCF and FMC). After each impregnation step the solids were dried at 110 for 2.5 h. The deposition of each element was followed by calcination in air at 550 for 6 h except for the coim- pregnated (sample (MCF)) where only one last calcination was performed. 2.2. Determination of the specific surface area The specific surface area of the oxide catalysts was determined by the BET method using a static (volumetric) apparatus. 2.3. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) The diffuse reflectance spectra of the specimens studied were recorded in the range 800-200 nm at room temperature, using a Cary 219 spectrophotometer equipped with a DRS accessory. The alumina support was used as reference in all cases. The powder samples were mounted in a quartz cell which provided a sample thickness larger than 3 mm and guaranteed correct determination of the optical density, 1/Rinf (Rinf = reflectance at infinite sample thickness). 2.4. Adsorption of nitric oxide The dynamic method was used to study chemisorption of nitric oxide. The experiments were performed in laboratory constructed equipment consisting of three parts: (a) the gas-handling system where the gases were purified and the flow rates adjusted, (b) the adsorption vessel connected to a six-port valve for injection of nitric oxide pulses, and (c) an Intersmat IGC-120ML thermal conductivity detector and an Intersmat integrator-recorder for the determination of the amount of nitric oxide eluted from the adsorption vessel. A preweighed amount of the oxide catalyst (200 mg) was introduced to the adsorption vessel and then sulfided under a 15 vol.-% H2S/H2 stream at 400 for 2 h. The amount of adsorbed hydrogen sulfide was removed by flushing the sample with Ar at 400 for 0.5 h. The sample was then cooled down to room temperature and remained, under He for 1 h. Pulses of the adsorption mixture (5 vol.-% NO/ He) were subsequently introduced. The amount of NO eluted after each injection was measured until two successive pulses gave a difference less than 1%. The total uptake of nitric oxide was thus determined. The catalyst was then maintained for 1 h under a stream of pure He and the procedure was repeated. The difference in H. Matralis et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 221-236 uptake of nitric oxide during the first and the second adsorption cycles was consid- ered to be equal to the amount of chemisorbed nitric oxide [ 26,27 ]. 2.5. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) The XPS spectra were recorded by a Vacuum Generators ESCA 3 spectrometer equipped with an aluminium anode (AI Ka= 1486.6 eV) which operated at 20 mA and 10 kV. The residual pressure inside the spectrometer was about 10 -7 Pa. A signal averager (Tractor Northern 1710) was used in order to improve the signal- to-noise ratio. The A1 2p peak (74.5 eV) was used as a reference. 2.6. Determination of catalytic activity The catalytic tests were performed in a fixed-bed reactor operating under atmos- pheric pressure. All reactants were in the gas phase. The oxide precursors (0.1 g, 100-150 mesh) were presulfided in situ under a stream (20 ml/min) of 15 vol.-% H2S/H2 at 400 for 2 h. The reaction feed (20 ml/min) was prepared by passing H2 (Linde, 99.999 vol.-%) through a bubbler filled with thiophene (Fluka AG, > 98%) at 0. After an aging period of 15 h under the stream of the reactants' mixture, the conversion of thiophene was determined at 250, 275, 300, 325 and 350. A gas chromatograph (Pye Unicam) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a column (8 m x 1/8 in. O.D.) filled with Carbowax 20M on Chro- mosorb p(AW) was used for the analysis. 3. Results and discussion We have arranged the presentation of our results and their discussion according to the order of the questions stated in the introduction, taking into account the explanatory scheme illustrated in Fig. 1. The HDS activity determined at various temperatures for the catalysts studied is illustrated in Fig. 2. It can be observed that for all temperatures examined the deposition of the F- ions before or after the deposition of the Mo and Co phases causes an increase in the catalytic activity, whereas the simultaneous deposition on the support surface of the Mo, Co and F species decreases the catalytic activity with respect to the undoped specimen. Moreover, careful inspection of Fig. 2. shows that in all cases F doping after Mo and Co deposition results in the catalyst with the highest catalytic activity. In order to shed light on the fore-mentioned effects, it is necessary to study the effects which the F doping causes on several surface properties of the catalysts studied. Fig. 3. illustrates the influence of the order of deposition of the F- ions on the amount of NO chemisorbed per gram or per square meter of the catalysts. Let us concentrate our attention to the former parameter, used in the present study as an approximate measure of the number of active sites. It can be observed that the H.

As to the density of active sites it should be mentioned that it is expressed approximately by the amount of the chemisorbed NO per square meter of catalyst. One may observe (Fig. 3) that in all cases studied the F doping increases the density of the active sites. The most important effect is achieved when the F- ions are deposited after the formation of the Mo and Co supported phases. The increase in the density of the active sites follows the order MCF > FMC > (MCF) > MC. The competitive action of the fore- mentioned opposite effects, namely the decrease in specific surface area and the increase in the density of the active sites, is sufficient to explain the quite compli- cated effect, described above, which the F doping provokes on the number of the active sites.

Matralis et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 221-236 In view of the above considerations it can be noted that the effect of the priority of the F- deposition on HDS activity can be reduced to the following effects caused by the F doping: First, to the decrease in specific surface area with the order MC > FMC > (MCF) > MCF. Second, to the increase in the density of active sites following the order MCF>FMC> (MCF)>MC. Third, to the increase of the intrinsic activity for the MCF catalyst. In the following we shall try to interpret the above effects. Our attempt will be based on information taken from the literature (mainly from studies dealing with the adsorption of Mo vl and Co n species on the y-alumina surface), on DRS spectra recorded for the catalysts studied, as well as on the values of binding energies and of the surface ratios IMo 3ds/2//A1 2p and/Co 203n/Igl Zp determined by X-ray photo- electron spectroscopy. It should be mentioned that an increase in the binding energy of the Mo vI or Co supported species indicates an increase in the supported species- carder interactions [ 28,29 ] which in turn suggest an increase in the dispersity of the supported species. Concerning the fore-mentioned surface ratios it should be noted that their value depends on two physical characteristics. First, on the dispersity of the Mo and Co supported species and, second, on the repartition of these species within the support grain. Thus, deposition of the Mo and Co phases around the mouths of the pores of the support is expected to give relatively high values of these ratios even if the dispersity is relatively low. During dry impregnation, deposition of the Mo vI species on the y-alumina surface takes place by three mechanisms. First, by adsorption of the MoO 2- and Mo7064 ions on sites created by the protonated surface hydroxyls of y-alumina ( A1OH2 + ) [ 30-35 ]. Second, by reaction of the MoOJ- ions with the neutral surface hydroxyls of y-alumina (AIOH) [ 36-38] and, third, by uncontrolled precipitation of the Mo vI species during the drying step which follows the impregnation. The critical ratio (amount of Mo v1 species deposited by precipitation)/(amount of Mo w deposited by adsorption and surface reaction) depends mainly (at approxi- mately constant pH) on the number of the AIOH2 + plus A1OH groups. It is widely recognised that this ratio is proportional to the ratio Mo(w vI~/Mos ~vI) , where Mow~v1~ represents Mo vl supported species weakly bounded on the support surface with relatively low dispersity and Mos ~vI) represents Mo vI supported species strongly bounded on the support surface with relatively high dispersity. As to the deposition of the Co ~ ions, it takes place by two mechanisms. First, by adsorption of the Co n ions on sites created by the deprotonated surface hydroxyls of y-alumina (A10-) and presumably by the MoO- groups [39]. Second, by precipitation of the cobalt species. The critical ratio (Co n precipitated)/(Co n adsorbed) depends, at approximately constant pH, on the number of A10- and MoO- surface groups. This ratio is proportional to the ratio Cow/Cos where w(s) stands again for the weakly (strongly) bounded Co supported species with relatively low (high) dis- persity. Let us now try to interpret the observed decrease in the specific surface area. We examine first the specimen FMC for which a rather small decrease in the specific 230 H. Matralis et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 221-236 Table 2 Binding energies (BE) and XPS atomic ratios (IMo = 1Mo 3d/IA~ 2p and/Co =Ico 2p/IAj 2p) of the oxidic samples Sample O ls (eV) F Is (eV) Mo 3d5/2 (eV) Co 2p3/2 (eV) IMol02 lcol0 z MC 531.6 -232.7 782.1 1.4 5.1 MCF 531.7 685.9 232.9 782.2 0.9 1.1 FMC 531.6 685.9 232.5 781.7 1.6 6.0 (MCF) 531.5 686.0 232.1 781.3 1.5 1.9 surface area is observed (Table 1 ). This is due to the fact that the doping of the 7- alumina surface with such a small amount of F ions is not expected to cause considerable changes in the texture of the support. In fact, in this dopant concen- tration the fluoride ions are not expected to form AIF3 which eventually could provoke a decrease in the specific surface area by closing pores of the support in the step of the first calcination. In this dopant concentration the F- ions are simply dispersed on the 7-alumina surface replacing neutral surface hydroxyls [ 4,40--43 ]. The fact that no A1F3 if formed is confirmed by the binding energy measured for the F 1 s photoelectrons (Table 2); indeed the value determined in the present work (685.9 eV) is quite different from that reported for A1F3, namely 687.5 eV [42]. However, it should be noted that the doping of 7-alumina by fluoride ions increases the relative concentration of the A10- groups at the expense of the A1OHf and A1OH groups [44]. In view of the considerations of the previous paragraph, the decrease in the concentration of the AIOHf and A1OH groups is expected to increase the relative contribution of the precipitation of the Mo vx species to the ~/r,,~Vl~/rvr,~v~ As the drying step starts whole deposition and therefore the ratio .... w ..... s from the mouth of the pores a movement of the molybdate solution from the bottom to the mouth of the pores should be anticipated during the second drying which in turn should favour the formation of loosely bounded and relatively badly dispersed Mo vI species near the pore mouths. The decrease in the binding energy of the Mo 3d5/2 photoelectrons observed and the increase in the ratio IMo 3ds/2/IA1 2p with respect to the undoped specimen (Table 2) corroborates the picture described above. It is reasonable to assume that during the second calcination a sintering of the fore-mentioned loosely bounded MO vI species causes a closing of a portion of the relatively thin pores. On the other hand it is expected that this poor Mo dispersion will also result in a poor Co dispersion during the third calcination. Indeed, it is well known that the dispersion of cobalt is favoured by the presence of a well dispersed Mo monolayer, whereas large Co agglomerates loosely bounded on the support are formed on bare alumina. The poor dispersion of cobalt is in agreement with the decrease in the value of the binding energy of the Co 2p3/2 photo electrons as well as with the increase of the ratio/Co 2p~12/IA~2p with respect to the undoped specimen. It may be reasonably assumed that during the third calcination a sintering of the so-formed loosely bounded Co species provokes a closing of an additional portion of thin pores contributing thus to the observed decrease in the specific surface area. H. Matralis et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 221-236 The decrease in specific surface area is greater when the F-, Co I! and Mo vI species are co-deposited on the support surface by a simple dry impregnation. The pH of the impregnation solution in this case was equal to 6.2, whereas the point of zero charge (pzc) of our alumina support was 5.3. It is, thus, expected that the support when contacted with this impregnation solution, will present a lower con- centration of A1OH2 + plus AIOH surface groups as compared to the corresponding concentration during preparation of the other samples where the pH of the Mo- containing solutions (5.5) is closer to the pzc of the support. In addition, it is known that F- ions compete with the Mo 7 064 and MoO 2 -species for the same deposition sites, namely for the A1OHf and A1OH surface groups. These two reasons, namely the decrease of the concentration of the A1OH2 + plus A1OH groups and the com- petition for these groups by Mo 7 064, MoO 2- and F- ions, decrease the Mo vI deposition by adsorption and surface reaction provoking thus an increase in the ratio -.-vwWln (vi) . The increased deposition by precipitation brings about accu- ( w~ --.-vs/lk'ffn mulation of loosely bounded MO vI species near to the pore mouths by the mecha- nism described previously. Thus, a decrease in the Mo 3d5/2 binding energy indicating a relatively weak dispersion and an increase in the ratio IMo 3d~/2/IA1 2p should be again anticipated in agreement with our results (Table 2). As to the cobalt, the drastic decrease in the binding energy for the Co 2p3/2 photoelectrons (Table 2) indicates a very low dispersity of the supported Co species and justifies the decrease in the ratio/co 2p3/2/IA~2p even in the case where the Co supported species are accumulated near to the pore mouths. Although it is not anticipated that the presence of the F- ions in the impregnating solution could have a direct effect on the Co deposition, the strong lateral interactions exerted between the Co II ions and the Mo w species near to the support surface [ 45 ] presumably result to a cobalt repartition determined by the Mo vI species. However, in any case, the sintering (during calcination) of the Mo vI supported species, and presumably of the Co species, badly dispersed near the pore mouths adequately explain the decrease in the specific surface area observed for the specimen (MCF) with respect to the undoped catalyst. Let us finally examine the specimen MCF. It is plausible to assume that the drastic decrease in its specific surface ~ea can be attributed to phenomena taking place during the third impregnation, the subsequent drying and the final calcination. These phenomena cause, in addition to the decrease in the specific surface area, a slight increase in the values of the binding energies of the Mo 3d5/2 and Co 2p3/2 photoelectrons, as well as a considerable decrease in the ratios IMo 3ds/2/IA12p and /CoZp3/:/IAl2p. It should be noted that the constant values obtained for the O ls and F Is photoelectrons indicate the absence of charging effects. Therefore, we can consider significant the fore-mentioned increase in the binding energies. In the following we try to develop a convincing picture taking into account these obser- vations. It is reasonable to assume that during the third impregnation a portion of the loosely bounded Mo and Co supported species are dissolved. Due to the rela- tively high pH of the aqueous solution of the NHaF (pH = 7.4) compared with that H. Matralis et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 221-236 of ammonium heptamolybdate (pH = 5.5) it is expected that the solubility of the Mo v1 species will be greater than the solubility of the Co species. During this impregnation the so-dissolved Mo and Co species are uniformly distributed in the liquid phase inside the pore system. As the concentration of Co and Mo species in this solution is relatively low a great portion of these species is redeposited by adsorption. Therefore, an increase in the dispersity is anticipated in agreement with the increase in the binding energies mentioned above (Table 2). On the other hand it is expected that the adsorption should take place near the bottom of the pores where, due to the mechanism described for the previous specimen, the possibility of finding a bare support surface is higher than that in the upper parts of the pores. As in the third impregnation the deposition of the Mo and Co species takes place mainly by adsorption, one cannot expect considerable change in the repartition of the Mo and Co species during the third drying and calcination. Taking into account that the sensitivity of XPS is relatively low in the region near to the bottoms of the pores one may understand the considerable decrease in the ratios IMo3ds/2/IAl 2p and/Co 2p/IAl2p with respect to the corresponding ones measured for the undoped specimen (Table 2). As to the considerable decrease in specific surface area (Table 1 ), the determi- nation of the pore volume distribution for the specimens MC and MCF has shown that this decrease is related with the modification of the very narrow pores, namely of the pores with radius lower than 15 ~,, [17]. This can be attributed to the following mechanisms. During the third impregnation a slight surface dissolution of the y-alumina results in the removal of the very thin walls between the micropores and the formation of larger ones [43]. Moreover, the partial dissolution of the Co and Mo phases mentioned above and the subsequent adsorption of polymolybdate species on the inner walls around the very thin necks of the narrow pores result in the closing of the down part of these pores. In the above an attempt has been made in order for convincing pictures to be developed explaining the changes in the specific surface area as well as in the repartition and dispersity of the Mo and Co supported species. Careful observation of the binding energy values concerning the fluorinated specimens ( Table 2) shows that these decreased in the order MCF > FMC > (MCF) which is identical to that observed for the density of the active sites as was estimated by the amount of chemisorbed NO per square meter. This strongly suggests that concerning the fluorinated samples the deposition order of the F- ions changes the density of the active sites by altering the dispersity of the supported Co and Mo species. The validity of the above statement is limited only to the deposition order. It does not refer to the fluorination itself. In fact, fluorination before or simultaneously with the Mo and Co deposition increases the density of the active sites though it causes a decrease in the dispersity of the Mo vI and Co supported species. This suggests that fluorination increases, in addition, the number of active sites per square meter of the active phase. H.

DRS spectra of the samples in their oxidic state ( ) MC, ( ...... ) MCF, ( ...... ) FMC and ( ....... ) (MCF). As to the increase of the HDS activity per active site assumed above in order to explain the relatively high HDS activity of the MCF specimen (Fig. 4, Table 1 ) it should be realized that the HDS activity per active site is actually a mean value of a distribution of intrinsic activities. This value is expected to increase when sites with relatively high HDS activity are added to the distribution. It is well known that the very active HDS sites are presumably created on sulfided species produced from tetrahedral Mo vI species during activation. Moreover, it is known that octa- hedral cobalt incorporated into the polymerised Mo vl species promotes the activity of the molybdenum species formed after activation. It is therefore anticipated that the ratio (Mo vI tetrahedral)/(Mo vI octahedral) should be higher in the MCF compared to the other specimens. Moreover, an increase in the concentration of the fore-mentioned octahedral cobalt in this specimen is anticipated. The DRS spectra recorded in the range 200-800 nm show that this is the case (Fig. 5). In these spectra a band appears centred at ca. 750 nm which is attributed to octahedral Co II and/or Co In. It is influenced by the Co~I--Co III intervalence charge transfer absorp- tion. Its intensity can be taken as an approximate measure of the concentration of Co304 and/or CoO, as well as of the ConCom~A12_zO4 surface spinel and of octahedral Co incorporated into the polymerised Mo vI species [46-48]. It can be observed that the intensity of this band is slightly higher in the case of the MCF specimen as compared with that of the other catalysts. The triple band centred at about 630, 590 and 550 nm is attributed to the presence of tetrahedral Co H. This is frequently taken as a measure of the concentration of the catalytically inactive CoA1204 [49-51 ]. The intensity of this band is lower in the MCF compared with those obtained for the MC and FMC catalysts. However, the most important effect is observed in specimen (MCF); a considerable distortion of the original triplet H. Matralis et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 221-236 occurs, resulting in maxima at 630, 578 and 540 nm and a shoulder at ca. 510 nm. This suggests that a large portion of the tetrahedral Co n is transformed into trigonal Co n [52]. It is notable that this effect appears in the specimen with the minimal catalytic activity and the same has been observed in a previous study dealing with the influence of the F content on HDS activity [ 17]. In the DRS spectra appear bands centred at about 250-280 nm and 290-330 nm. The former is attributed to monomeric Mo vl in tetrahedral coordination symmetry and the latter to polymeric Mo vI species. In these species MO vI is in both octahedral and tetrahedral sites [ 36,53-55 ]. In view of the above the ratio of the Schuster-Kubelka-Munk function values at 305 and 265 nm F(R)ao5/F(R)265could be taken as an approximate measure of the ratio (Mo vI octahedral)/(Mo vl tetrahedral). It may be observed that this ratio is lower in the specimen MCF compared with those obtained for the other three specimens (Table 1 ) in agreement with the prediction stated above. 4. Conclusions We may now summarise our conclusions concerning the influence of the depo- sition order of F- ions on the HDS activity, as well as on several physicochemical characteristics of the CoMo/y-A1203-F catalysts. (i) A change in the deposition order causes a change in both specific area (FMC > (MCF)>MCF) and dispersity of the supported Mo w and Co species (MCF > FMC > (FMC)). (ii) Fluorination increases the number of active sites per unit surface area of the active phase, as well as the HDS activity per active site. The latter depends on the deposition order of the F- ions. (iii) The changes in the dispersity and in the number of active sites per unit surface area of the active phase mentioned above, cause in turn an increase in the density of the HDS active sites (number of active sites per unit surface area of catalyst) following the order MCF> FMC > (MCF) > MC. (iv) The change in specific surface area and in the density of the HDS active sites mentioned above explain the quite complicated effect caused by changing the order of the F- deposition on the number of the HDS active sites. (v) The change in the number of the HDS active sites and in the activity of each site cause a change in the HDS activity which follows the order MCF> FMC > MC > (MCF). (vi) The specimen MCF, which in the oxidic precursor state had the least (Mo vr octahedral) /(Mo v~ tetrahedral) ratio, exhibited the highest HDS activity. References [ 1 ] J.G.

In order to elucidate the influence on the hydrodesulphurization (HDS) activity of the order of deposition of F− ions on CoMo/γ-Al2O3-F catalysts, we prepared, characterized (using BET, NO chemisorption, DRS and XPS) and determined the HDS activity (at atmospheric pressure and various temperatures using the HDS of thiophene as model reaction) of four samples. Specifically, we prepared one undoped CoMo/γ-Al2O3 catalyst (denoted as MC) and three fluorinated catalysts in which the F− ions were deposited before (FMC), after (MCF) and simultaneously with the MoVI and CoII phases ((MCF)). All the specimen which were prepared contained a fixed amount of Mo (11.5 wt.-% MoO3), Co (3.5 wt.-% C03O4) and F (0.8 wt.-% F). It was found that a change in the deposition order provoked a change in the specific surface area, in the dispersity of the supported Mo and Co species and in the intrinsic activity of each HDS active site. The last change was found to be related to the ratio Mo(octahedral)/Mo(tetrahedral). Moreover, it was inferred that fluorination increased the number of active sites per unit active surface. The above explained the changes in the density of the HDS active sites, in the number of these sites and finally on the HDS activity which follows the order MCF>FMC>MC>(MCF) in all temperatures studied. Finally, an attempt was made to convincingly develop pictures related to the preparation which explain the influence of the F doping on the specific surface area and dispersity of the Mo and Co supported species.

        "dc:description": "In order to elucidate the influence on the hydrodesulphurization (HDS) activity of the order of deposition of F− ions on CoMo/γ-Al2O3-F catalysts, we prepared, characterized (using BET, NO chemisorption, DRS and XPS) and determined the HDS activity (at atmospheric pressure and various temperatures using the HDS of thiophene as model reaction) of four samples. Specifically, we prepared one undoped CoMo/γ-Al2O3 catalyst (denoted as MC) and three fluorinated catalysts in which the F− ions were deposited before (FMC), after (MCF) and simultaneously with the MoVI and CoII phases ((MCF)). All the specimen which were prepared contained a fixed amount of Mo (11.5 wt.-% MoO3), Co (3.5 wt.-% C03O4) and F (0.8 wt.-% F). It was found that a change in the deposition order provoked a change in the specific surface area, in the dispersity of the supported Mo and Co species and in the intrinsic activity of each HDS active site. The last change was found to be related to the ratio Mo(octahedral)/Mo(tetrahedral). Moreover, it was inferred that fluorination increased the number of active sites per unit active surface. The above explained the changes in the density of the HDS active sites, in the number of these sites and finally on the HDS activity which follows the order MCF>FMC>MC>(MCF) in all temperatures studied. Finally, an attempt was made to convincingly develop pictures related to the preparation which explain the influence of the F doping on the specific surface area and dispersity of the Mo and Co supported species.",
