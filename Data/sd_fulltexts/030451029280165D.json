Herrmann Anorganisch-chemisches Institut der Technischen Uniuersitat Munchen, Lichtenbergstr. 4, D-8046 Garching (Germany) Abstract The reaction of methyltrioxorhenium with the surface of niobium oxide leads to an active catalyst for the metathesis of acyclic olefins. The activity is related to the niobia surface acidity and to a methylrhenium surface species that resonates at 25 ppm on the 13C MAS NMR spectrum. Introduction One of the goals of surface organometallic chemistry, SOMC (i.e., the study of the reactivity of organometallic complexes with the surface of inorganic oxides or metals), is the synthesis of well-defined surfaceanchored complexes [1]. Since the rules controlling organometallic reactions in solution and on surfaces have been shown to be similar [1], the same synthetic strategies can be used to obtain grafted transition metal complexes with a predetermined coordination sphere. In homogeneous catalysis, considerable progress was made once control of the coordination sphere of the metal could be achieved so as to obtain a catalyst selective for a given reaction. Thus, if one considers the olefin metathesis reaction, considerable improvements in homogeneous catalysts are related to the discovery of the metallocarbene mechanism of Chauvin [2]. Most active catalysts now incorporate a metallocarbene [3] or a metallacycle [4]. In heterogeneous catalysis, however, the exact nature of the coordination sphere of Re in the most active catalysts, Re2O,/A1zO3, with or without the presence of an alkylating agent such as SnR4, is *Communication 106 on `Multiple Bonds between Main Group Elements and Transition Metals'. For the preceding communication, see [121. 0304-5102/92/$5.00 1992 - Elsevier Sequoia. All rights reserved 288 still a matter of speculation [5]. Chemisorption of methyltrioxorhenium, CH,Re03, on alumina and on silica alumina [6] gives an active metathesis catalyst. This new generation of catalysts can be considered to provide real progress in the field, since the methyl substituent on rhenium might be the source of the metallocarbene and since the general class of compounds of formula R-Re03 (R: alkyl, aryl) is now available [7]. Obviously, the nature of the oxide on which CH,Re03 is chemisorbed is an important parameter. It may govern, via its redox and acid-base properties, the final oxidation state and coordination sphere of rhenium. This is why we have explored the reactivity of CH,Re03 toward various inorganic oxides, and more specifically toward niobia. Experimental CH3Re03 was prepared as described in the literature [7a]. Nb205-nH20 (from C.B.M.M.) was calcined at 450 C under a stream of OZ (1.21 h-1, 16 h); after cooling to room temperature and evacuation (10-2 Pa), it was exposed to water (3 kPa, 3 h) and then evacuated (16 h) at the desired temperature T. We will refer to this solid as Nb20,[T]. Solvents (Prolabo) were distilled under N2 over Na/benzophenone (pentane, hexane) or PZOs (chlorobenzene, CH,C12) and stored under Ar on 4 A molecular sieves. Cis-2-pentene, 1-pentene (Aldrich) and pyridine (Prolabo) were stored on molecular sieves (4 A). Catalyst preparation The catalysts were prepared in situ by impregnation of the support with a solution of CH,Re03 in CHZC12 or n-hexane, using Schlenk tube techniques. When CH,Cl2 was used as the solvent, it was removed under vacuum and replaced by chlorobenzene for the catalytic tests. For the surface organometallic studies, the samples were prepared by sublimation, using standard break-and-seal techniques. In all cases, the samples contained ca. 1 wt. % Re. Activity measurements Catalytic experiments were carried out under Ar in glass batch reactors (Schlenk flasks) using n-pentane as an internal standard. Analysis of the gas phase was performed on a Intersmat IGC FL chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and using an Ale 03 /KCl-onfused-silica capillary column (50 m x 0.32 mm). Conversions were calculated as follows, for the metathesis of 1-pentene: conversion (%) = 2[ethene] x 100 2[ethene] + [1-pentene] 289 Infrared studies In situ IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 10 MX Fourier transform spectrometer, using special cells described previously [8]. The pyridine adsorption studies were carried out in the following way: pyridine was adsorbed at room temperature on a disk of Nb205[T] of about 20 mg, pretreated as described above and then desorbed at 150 C. Peak areas were measured using the integration program of the FT-IR spectrometer. Microcalorimetric measurements Microcalorimetric measurements were performed with a heat-flow microcalorimeter maintained at 100 C. The samples were evacuated (10-2 Pa, 16 h) at the desired temperature. The procedures of calibration and of ammonia adsorption by successive pulses have been described elsewhere [9]. \"C CP-MAS NMR studies 13C MAS NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker MSL spectrometer operating at 75.4 MHz and equipped with a double-bearing probe allowing spinning frequencies of 3-4 kHz. The conditions of cross-polarization were: contact time 5 ms, 90 for 1H = 6.2 ,us. Typically, 27 000 scans were accumulated, with a delay of 2 s. Chemical shifts are given relative to external TMS. The spectra were simulated with the LINESIM program provided by Bruker. These studies were carried out with a 13C (99%) labelled sample of CH3Re03. Results and discussion Effect of various supports on catalytic activity Methyltrioxorhenium has been chemisorbed on a number of inorganic oxides, showing different acid-base surface properties. A survey of the catalytic activity of the solids obtained by the metathesis reaction of cis-2-pentene leads to the following conclusions (Table 1): Silica[500] and titania[200] do not have any effect on the catalytic activity of CH3Re03, i.e., when supported on these oxides, CH3Re03 remains inactive. Magnesia[400] provides only a low activity. However, when CH3Re03 is Supported on niobia, an efficient catalyst for the metathesis of acyclic olefins is obtained. (Niobium oxide alone, under the same experimental conditions, catalyzes only double-bond migration.) Thus 500 equivalents of cis-2-pentene are equilibrated in less than 5 min at room temperature. If, after equilibrium has been reached, the liquid phase is filtered off and another 500 equivalents of cis-2-pentene are added, the initial reaction rate decreases slightly but the catalyst is still active. Working in this way, the catalytic system can carry out the metathesis of at least 2500 equivalents of cis-2-pentene (Fig. 1). 290 TABLE 1 Effects of various supports on catalytic activity Supports Surface acidity Catalytic activity' Si02[500]` weak Bronsted acid sites none Ti02[200] only Lewis acid sites none Mg0[400] no acid sites very low Nb205[300] strong Bronsted and Lewis acid sites equilibrium in 1 min aRe:support =1:100 (w/w), except for Ti02 (4:100).

A number of questions concerning the effect of the support arise from these results. Is there any correlation between the number and/or the nature of the surface acidic sites and catalytic activity for metathesis? What is the nature of the ligands, the oxidation state of rhenium and the associated chemistry of the resulting rhenium surface complex(es)? In order to try to answer these questions, we have studied the most active system, i.e., CH3Re03/Nb205, in some detail. Correlation between catalytic activity and surface acidity of Nbz05 The surface acidity of the oxides depends upon the temperature of pretreatment, [T]. The surface Lewis and Bronsted acidity of Nb205 was determined by pyridine adsorption, which was followed by IR spectroscopy (see Experimental).

Solvent = chlorobenzene. 291 of the band at 1446 cm-1, typical of pyridine coordinated to a Lewis acid center [10], are presented as a function of [T] in Fig. 2. The highest number of Lewis acid sites is observed between 200 and 300 C. The number of Bronsted acid sites is highest at low temperatures, i.e., 110 C; above this temperature and up to 200 C, it decreases rapidly. When Nb205 is dehydroxylated above 400 C, the number of Bronsted and Lewis acid sites becomes very low. The strong decrease in the total number of surface acid sites cannot originate exclusively from the slight decrease in the specific surface area at the pretreatment temperature (130 m2 g-1 at 110 C to 90 m2 g-1 at 400 C). This behavior is in good agreement with published literature data on a similar niobium oxide [11]. Measurement of the differential heat of adsorption of ammonia by microcalorimetry showed that the surface acidity is very heterogeneous. Between 110 C and 300 C, the total amount of acidic sites (Lewis plus Bronsted) is almost constant (ca. 155 x 10-6 mol g-1), which is in close agreement with the IR data of pyridine adsorption. The activity of a series of CH3Re03/Nb205[T] toward metathesis of 1-pentene is reported in Fig. 3 as a function of [T]. The variation of the Lewis surface acidity of Nb205 is very similar to that observed for the metathesis activity of CH,Re03/Nbz05: both curves present a maximum for [T] between 200 C and 300 C. This suggests that Lewis acid sites may be involved in the formation of the catalytically active centers. Nevertheless, one cannot exclude an eventual participation of the Bronsted acid centers in the process of the formation of the surface rhenium complexes. It is also worth pointing out that, in the presence of CH3Re031 the double-bond migration activity of Nb205 is totally suppressed, suggesting that the Bronsted acid sites, which are assumed to be responsible for this isomerization reaction [11], were consumed by reaction with CH,Re03, In order to obtain some insight into the nature of the active centers, we studied the reactivity of CH3Re03 toward Nb20.- _CM .

Surface organometallic chemistry of CH~Re03 with Nb205 CH,Re03 is chemisorbed on the surface of Nb20, at room temperature, as shown by the fact that the solid immediately becomes purple when CH,Re03 (originally white) is sublimed onto it. No Re complex can be extracted, either by using a strongly coordinating solvent (such as pyridine) or by a metathetic exchange reaction (with [PPN] Cl or Na[BPh4]). The methyl ligand of CH,Re03 remains on the surface, as confirmed by IR data (vas(CH3): 2990 cm-'; v,,(CH,): 2902 cm-`) and the fact that no significant amount of CH, CO, C02 or any CZ hydrocarbon is released in the gas phase. Solid-state '3C NMR spectra of CH3Re03/ Nb205[T] indicate that there are at least three methylrhenium surface species, characterized by their chemical shifts at 41 (C), 31 (B) and 25 (A) ppm, respectively, as shown on the deconvoluted spectrum (Fig. 4)*. The changes in the relative intensities of the '3C MAS NMR spectra of CH3Re03/Nb205[T] as a function of [T], given in Table 2, show that species A is favored for [T] between 200 and 300 C, the same temperature range in which metathesis activity is highest. Thus there appears to be a correlation between catalytic activity and the presence of species A. NMR spectroscopy showed that all three species were stable, at room temperature, toward dry oxygen; there was neither gas evolution nor any influence on catalytic activity. Species A is decomposed under carefully deoxygenated water, and the catalytic activity is simultaneously totally suppressed. We have not detected, by '3C MAS NMR, any resonance that could be attributed to a rhenium methylidene surface complex, [Re] --CH,, but one should be aware of the fact that, to our knowledge, no \"C *Deconvolution was made possible only after a review of a whole series of spectra, one spectrum of which showed only one peak at 41 ppm. For the deconvolution, we assumed that the three observed peaks always corresponded to the same three species. We emphasize that the values in Table 2 (integrated peak area) do not correspond to the absolute concentration of each species, because the relaxation times may not be the same for all three species. 293 50 40 30 20 10 0 Chemical Shift (ppm) Fig. 4.

The question then arises of whether the active center is a methyl or a methylidene Re surface complex, resulting from the reaction between CH3Re03 and Nb205. A correlation between the catalytic activity and the presence of a methyl ligand was observed by studying the evolution of methane when the system was heated under vacuum (Fig. 5).

This result suggests that the metathesis activity is due to the presence of the methyl ligand. Regarding the possibility of a methylidene Re complex, the only way to get a clear answer is to chemically titrate the possible Re=CHZ via a metathesis reaction, using a labelled CH,ReO3/Nb2O5 and a symmetric olefin. In separate work, we have established, via this reaction, that the carbene species whose presence is implied in the catalytic cycle does not originate from the methyl group [12]. Conclusions A high metathesis activity is observed when CH,Re03 is chemisorbed on Nb205. The activity (for 1-pentene metathesis) is highest when niobia is pretreated between 200 and 300 C before CH,Re03 is chemisorbed. There appears to be a correlation between the catalytic activity and the Lewis acidity of the support, and between the catalytic activity and the presence of an alkyl fragment on the surface. No evidence for a surface carbene species could be obtained by 13C CP-MAS NMR spectroscopy. Acknowledgements R.B. thanks C.A.P.E.S. (Brazil) for a fellowship.

The activity is related to the niobia surface acidity and to a methylrhenium surface species that resonates at 25 ppm on the 13C MAS NMR spectrum. References 1 (a) Yu.I. Yermakov B.N. Kuznetsov V.A.
