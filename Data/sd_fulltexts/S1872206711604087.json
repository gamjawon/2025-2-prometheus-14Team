DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(11)60408-7 ARTICLE Low Cost Synthesis of 3D Flowerlike Co 3 O 4 Nanostructures as Active Catalyst for CO Oxidation CAO Changyan, DOU Zhifeng, LIU Hua, SONG Weiguo* Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Science (BNLMS), Laboratory of Molecular Nanostructures and Nanotechnology, Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China Abstract: 3D flowerlike Co 3 O 4 nanostructures were prepared by a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method, which is a rapid, tem- plate-free, and low cost method. The product is obtained in two minutes using all inorganic precursors. The precursor concentration and gradual hydrolysis of urea determine the morphology of Co 3 O 4 nanostructures. These flowerlike Co 3 O 4 nanostructures have high surface area and expose largely active (110) planes, leading to relative high catalytic activity in CO oxidation. Key words: carbon monoxide; oxidation; cobaltosic oxide; nanostructure; microwave Cobalt oxide (Co 3 O 4 ) nanomaterials are widely used in het- erogeneous catalysts, chemical sensors, lithium-ion batteries, and magnetic materials [1â€“14]. Various Co 3 O 4 structures such as nanoparticles [4], nanocubes [1,15], nanorods [2,3], nanosheets [1], nanowires [16], hollow spheres, and flowerlike nanostructures [17â€“20] have been synthesized by a variety of methods. Their properties in these applications strongly depend on their sizes and morphologies. In particular, three-dimensional (3D) flowerlike Co 3 O 4 nanostructures are composed of nanosized building blocks while their total sizes are in micrometer scale. Such hierarchical structures possess advantages of both microstructures and nanostructures, i.e. large surface area, facile mass transportation, and easiness to recycle, making them ideal materials for catalysis. Soft templates (surfactants) are frequently used to prepare 3D flowerlike nanostructures [21â€“26]. However, expensive organic surfactants, and in many cases organic cobalt precur- sors and organic solvent (ethylene glycol (EG)) are needed in these ployol mediated methods. Removing these templates adds another time consuming and costly calcination step. It will be very desirable for the practical application of flowerlike Co 3 O 4 nanostructures if they can be produced by a reliable, low cost, and template-free method in aqueous medium. The microwave assisted hydrothermal method is a reliable and rapid method to produce nanomaterials, including CeO 2 hollow nanospheres [27] and flowerlike NiO hollow nano- spheres [28]. In this study, flowerlike Co 3 O 4 nanostructures were produced using cobalt chloride and urea as raw materials, and water as solvent. Unlike previously reported EG-mediated methods for flowerlike nanostructures [24â€“26], no organic template, organic metal compounds or organic solvent was used. All chemicals used were low cost inorganic compounds and environmentally benign. The synthesis reaction time was completed in less than 2 min with microwave heating. These make this aqueous route a rapid, reliable and low cost method that can be scaled up in practical uses. These 3D flowerlike Co 3 O 4 nanostructures had high surface area with largely active (110) planes being exposed, showing relatively high catalytic activity in CO oxidation. CO conversion reached 100% at 60 Â°C. 1 Experimental 1.1 Preparation of flowerlike Co 3 O 4 nanostructures In a typical procedure, 1 mmol CoCl 2 Â·6H 2 O (Beijing Chemicals Co.) and 1.5 mmol urea (Beijing Chemicals Co.) were dissolved in 100 ml deionized water, and then the reaction solution was poured into a Teflon-lined autoclave. The auto- CAO Changyan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1334â€“1339 clave was sealed and placed in a programmable microwave oven (MDS-6, Shanghai Sineo Microwave Chemistry Tech- nology Co., Ltd.). The oven was heated to 170 qC in 2 min by microwave irradiation and then kept at that temperature for another 2 min. After cooling to room temperature, precipitates were collected as Co 3 O 4 precursors by centrifugation and washed with water and ethanol three times, respectively. Co 3 O 4 was obtained after calcinations of the precursors in air at 200 qC for 4 h. Compared with the preparation of flowerlike Co 3 O 4 , Co 3 O 4 nanosheets were obtained using NaOH as alkali instead of urea with other conditions unchanged. While Co 3 O 4 nanowires can be obtained when the reaction concentration was magnified 5 times. 1.2 Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Rigaku D/max-2500 diffractometer with Cu K Ä® radiation (Èœ = 0.15418 nm) at 40 kV and 200 mA. The morphology and microstruc- tures of the samples were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JOEL 6701F), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 1011), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, FEI Tecnai F20). The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured on a Quantachrome Autosorb AS-1 instrument. The pore size distributions were derived from the desorption branches using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model. H 2 temperature-programmed reduction (H 2 -TPR) of different cobalt oxides was performed using 10% H 2 in N 2 as the re- ducing gas. The flow rate of H 2 /N 2 was adjusted by mass flow controller under 25 ml/min. The cell was a quartz tube with an inner diameter 8 mm and 50 mg of the catalyst was mounted with quartz wool. The hydrogen consumption was monitored by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) on raising the sam- ple temperature from room temperature to 500 qC at a con- stant rate of 5 qC/min. 1.3 CO oxidation test CO oxidation test was performed in a quartz tubular reactor (7 mm inside diameter) loaded with 50 mg Co 3 O 4 and 450 mg sea sand. The catalyst was activated first in air flow (25 ml/min) at 200 qC for 1 h. The CO oxidation test was carried out with 25 sccm flow of 1% CO in nitrogen and 25 sccm air (80% N 2 + 20% O 2 ). The gas composition was monitored by online gas chromatography (Shimadzu, GC-14C). 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Characterizations of flowerlike Co 3 O 4 nanostructures Figure 1(a) shows the low-magnification SEM image of typical Co 3 O 4 precursors after microwave heating. They were composed of flowerlike architectures approximately 2â€“3 È�m in diameter. A closer examination by high-magnification SEM (Fig. 1(b)) indicated that the entire structure of the architecture was built of many nanopetals. These nanopetals were ca. 60 nm thick and 1 È�m wide, and connected to each other to form 3D flowerlike structures. The TEM image (Fig. 1(c)) further con- firmed the flowerlike structures, which were similar to previ- ously reported iron oxide and ceria structures [24,25]. The powder XRD pattern of the typical precursor is shown in Fig. 2(1). The main diffraction peaks can be indexed to the hex- agonal phase of Co(OH) 2 (JCPDS 51-1731) and cubic phase of Co 3 O 4 (JCPDS 43-1003). The whole reaction processes can be illustrated by following equations (1)â€“(4): CO(NH 2 ) 2 + H 2 O Äº 2NH 3 + CO 2 (1) NH 3 + H 2 O Äº NH 4 + + OH (2) Co 2+ + 2OH Äº Co(OH) 2 (3) 6Co(OH) 2 + O 2 Äº 2Co 3 O 4 + 6H 2 O (4) After being calcined at 200 qC for 4 h in air, the precursors were transformed to pure phase Co 3 O 4 . The XRD pattern of calcined product (Fig. 2(2)) matched well with the standard PDF card (JCPDS 43-1003). The broaden diffraction peaks indicated the small size of nanocrystal building blocks. The TEM image in Fig. 3(a) shows a very similar flowerlike mor- phology, indicating that calcination did not change the total morphology of Co 3 O 4 . High-magnification TEM image (inset in Fig. 3(a)) showed that the nanopetals were composed of loose nanoparticles. The lattice fringes in the HR-TEM image 5 È�m (a) 1 È�m (b) 1 È�m (c) Fig. 1.

CAO Changyan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1334â€“1339 (Fig. 3(b)) showed a spacing of 0.47 nm due to the (111) planes and a spacing of 0.28 nm from the (220) planes of cubic Co 3 O 4 . The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm of flowerlike Co 3 O 4 is shown in Fig. 4. The specific surface area of flower- like Co 3 O 4 was 113 m 2 /g calculated from the adsorption iso- therm. Such high surface area was unusual for metal oxide and may be ascribed to the particular flowerlike hierarchical nanostructures. Two pore size distributions with average pore diameters of 4.2 and 17.6 nm were obtained by the BJH method. These pores were very likely due to the void spaces of stacked nanoparticles and curled nanopetals. 2.2 Formation mechanism of flowerlike Co 3 O 4 nanos- tructures In order to investigate the forming process of flowerlike Co 3 O 4 precursors, samples prepared at different reaction times were collected and investigated by SEM (Fig. 5). Disc like nanoplates were immediately formed when the temperature reached 170 qC (Fig. 5(a)). The samples collected 1 min later showed nanopetals as well as flowerlike nanostructures (Fig. 5(b)). As the reaction proceeded, all the samples became flowerlike structures with diameter of 2â€“3 È�m after 2 min (Fig. 5(c)). From this point, the size and morphology of the product remained nearly the same with longer reaction times (Fig. 5(d)). Common formation mechanism for such hierarchical nanostructures involved a two step growth model: fast nuclea- tion of primary particles to form nanopetals through Ost- wald-ripening followed by a self-assembly process [29]. However, Fig. 5 indicated that Co 3 O 4 was very different from the previous reports on flowerlike Ä®-Fe 2 O 3 or MgO though the morphologies of these three metal oxides were similar. For flowerlike Ä®-Fe 2 O 3 , amorphous spheres with smooth surface were first produced, and then the spheres changed into flow- erlike crystalline structure; for flowerlike MgO, twisted crys- talline ribbons (the building block for the whole flower like structure) were produced first, and then the ribbons assembled into flowerlike structure.

CAO Changyan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1334â€“1339 the starting building blocks seemed to be the disc like plates, which have similar XRD features as the final flowerlike structures. Shortened synthesis time (less than 1 min for disc like plates) also made it difficult to collect any species prior to the formation of nanoplates in Fig. 5(a). The flat disc started to roll and twist in Fig. 5(b). Further twisting and assembly led to flowerlike structures. Note that the yield of flat plates in Fig. 5(a) reached 100% based on the CoCl 2 Â·6H 2 O, thus the mor- phology evolution from Fig. 5(a) to 5(c) was not driven by the addition of new solid species. It was likely driven by the sur- face tension, as twisting and rolling decreased the overall sur- face tension of the materials. In those studies using organic templates, a small amount of flowerlike nanostructure was usually observed when no or- ganic template was added, suggesting that the role of organic templates was mostly to improve the uniform morphology of the products. However, the morphology of flowerlike Co 3 O 4 nanostructures in this work was quite uniform, as shown in Fig. 1(a). Microwave heating may be crucial for such uniform morphology. Microwave heating provides a much faster heat- ing rate than that by normal oven heating. Such fast wave heating may result in a fast hydrolysis of urea, fast Ost- wald-ripening, and fast self-assembly. Urea plays an essential role by providing a spatially uniform supply of OH ion source through hydrolysis [24,25,27]. The reaction between the Co 2+ and OH ions was thus homogene- ous within the whole reaction mixture. When sodium hydrox- ide or ammonia was used in place of urea, while other condi- tions were kept the same, hexagonal nanosheets as well as many nanoparticles were obtained (Fig. 6(a) and Fig. 6(b)). In addition, when urea concentration was high, nanowires were obtained (Fig. 6(c) and Fig. 6(d)). 2.3 Catalytic activity of flowerlike Co 3 O 4 nanostructures for CO oxidation CO oxidation is not only important in fuel cell industry but also a standard test reaction for oxidation catalysts [1,2,10,11,30,31]. The catalytic activity of Co 3 O 4 was con- trolled by two factors: the surface area and the planes exposed [1,2,15]. In order to illustrate the influence of morphology and structure on the property, Co 3 O 4 nanosheet and Co 3 O 4 nanowire were also test for comparison. The HR-TEM images of Co 3 O 4 nanosheet and Co 3 O 4 nanowire are shown in Fig. 7. Only (111) planes were exposed for nanowire, while both (111) and (220) planes were exposed for nanosheet. Figure 8 shows the CO conversion as a function of temperature of the three different morphologies Co 3 O 4 . It can be seen that flowerlike 1 È�m (b) 1 È�m (a) 10 È�m (d) 10 È�m (c) Fig. 6.

CAO Changyan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1334â€“1339 Co 3 O 4 had the highest catalytic activity. With flowerlike Co 3 O 4 the CO conversion reached 100% at 60 qC. For Co 3 O 4 nanosheet and Co 3 O 4 nanowire, the temperatures of 100% CO oxidation were 100 and 130 qC, respectively. Table 1 lists the surface area, planes exposed, and 100% CO conversion temperature of Co 3 O 4 with different morphologies. For Co 3 O 4 nanosheet and flowerlike Co 3 O 4 , because they ex- posed both (111) and (110) planes, the surface area might be the main factor for higher catalytic activity of the flowerlike Co 3 O 4 . However, Co 3 O 4 nanosheet showed higher activity than the Co 3 O 4 nanowires even though the latter had higher surface area, indicating that crystal planes were the decisive factor. As for Co 3 O 4 , theoretical studies have shown that (110) planes are significantly more active than (111) planes [2]. Therefore, the difference of catalytic activity between Co 3 O 4 nanosheet and Co 3 O 4 nanowire was mainly attributed to the exposed active planes. Flowerlike Co 3 O 4 nanostructures not only had highest surface area but also exposed active planes, resulting in the highest catalytic activity. Xie et al. [2] reported outstanding CO oxidation activity of Co 3 O 4 nanorods with carefully controlled morphology with 41% of (110) facets being exposed. The activity of the flower- like Co 3 O 4 catalyst in this work was lower than that in Xieâ€™s work but was still relative high, as 100% CO conversion reached at 60 qC. And the preparation method in this work was low cost as only CoCl 2 Â·6H 2 O urea and water were used, and all these raw materials were environmentally benign. The synthe- sis process was fast and ready to scale up. Thus for practical application, the flowerlike Co 3 O 4 catalyst may have advantages. 3 Conclusions A rapid and facile template-free microwave-assisted hydrothermal method was used to prepare flowerlike Co 3 O 4 nanostructures. This was a low cost and environmentally be- nign method. The obtained flowerlike Co 3 O 4 nanostructures had high surface area and exposed active (110) planes. As catalyst for CO oxidation, total CO conversion temperature was 60 qC. References 1 Hu L H, Peng Q, Li Y D. J Am Chem Soc, 2008, 130: 16136 2 Xie X W, Li Y, Liu Z Q, Haruta M, Shen W J.

ARTICLE Low Cost Synthesis of 3D Flowerlike Co3O4 Nanostructures as Active Catalyst for CO Oxidation Changyan CAO Zhifeng DOU Hua LIU Weiguo SONG * Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Science (BNLMS), Laboratory of Molecular Nanostructures and Nanotechnology, Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China * Corresponding author. Tel/Fax: +86-10-62557908 3D flowerlike Co3O4 nanostructures were prepared by a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method, which is a rapid, template-free, and low cost method. The product is obtained in two minutes using all inorganic precursors. The precursor concentration and gradual hydrolysis of urea determine the morphology of Co3O4 nanostructures. These flowerlike Co3O4 nanostructures have high surface area and expose largely active (110) planes, leading to relative high catalytic activity in CO oxidation. 摘要 采用一种快速、无模板、低成本的微波辅助水热法在 2 min 内制备了三维花状 Co3O4. 所用原料均是无机盐. 前驱体浓度和尿素的逐渐水解对 Co3O4 形貌影响很大. 制得的花状 Co3O4 比表面积大, 且暴露了 (110) 高活性指数面, 对 CO 氧化具有较高的催化活性.
