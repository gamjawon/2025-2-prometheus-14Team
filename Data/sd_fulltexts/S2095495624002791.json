Graphical abstract This work introduces lots of grain boundaries and defects into rare earth hydrides, through which the electronic conductivity of rare earth hydrides significantly decreases and the H− ion migration number is increased. Hydride ion (H−) conductors have drawn much attention due to their potential applications in hydride-ion-based devices. Rare earth metal hydrides (REH x ) have fast H− conduction which, unfortunately, is accompanied by detrimental electron conduction preventing their application as ion conductors. Here, REH x (RE = Nd, Ce, and Pr) with varied grain sizes, rich grain boundaries, and defects have been prepared by ball milling and subsequent sintering. The electronic conductivity of the ball-milled REH x samples can be reduced by 2–4 orders of magnitude compared with the non-ball-milled samples. The relationship of electron conduction and miscrostructures in REH x is studied and discussed based on experimental data and previously-proposed classical and quantum theories. The H− conductivity of all REH x is about 10−4 to 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature, showing promise for the development of H− conductors and their applications in clean energy storage and conversion. Keywords Hydride ion conduction Electron conduction Nanosized grain Crystal defect Electron scattering 1 Introduction Hydride ion (H−) conduction in solids has attracted great attention because of its potential applications in fuel cells, rechargeable batteries, and electrochemical conversion cells. The radius of H− is similar to that of oxygen ion, while H− is monovalent, so it possesses higher polarizability which is favourable for fast conduction in solids [1–4]. However, H−, on the other hand, is known to be a strong electron donor and prone to donating electrons to the lattice. Therefore, many known hydrides are mixed electronic and ionic conductors with electron-predominant conduction. For example, the rare earth hydrides (REH x ), which have been demonstrated to have fast H− conduction [5,6], are narrow band-gap semiconductors whose electronic conductivity is far higher than the ionic conductivity even when their hydrogen contents are nearly saturated [7,8]. This detrimental electron conduction hinders the application of many hydrides as ion conductors. To address this problem, researchers proposed to alter the compositions of materials [9–13]. In 2016, Kobayashi et al. developed the first example of pure H− conduction in oxyhydrides La2− x − y Sr x + y LiH1− x + y O3− y , whose cation sublattices have stronger electron-donating than H− [9]. On the other hand, substituting part of hydride ions with oxygen ions can deepen the donor level (relative to the vacuum level) and suppress electronic conduction [10]. It has been shown that the oxygen-substituted LaH3 (LaH2.8O0.1) samples have low electronic conductivity of about 10−6 S cm−1 at 20 °C [11]. However, the presence of oxygen in the anion sublattices inevitably hinders the migration of H−, resulting in higher migration barriers [12]. Very recently, we proposed another strategy to suppress electron conduction of LaH3, namely lattice deformation, which is by creating numerous nanosized grains and defects to effectively interfere electron transport but not significantly hinder H− migration [14]. The electronic conductivity of the deformed LaH3 is as low as the level of 10−6 S cm−1; however, that of well-crystallized counterpart is up to 2 S cm−1. In fact, similar phenomena that nanosized metals or semiconductors exhibit lower electron conduction have been studied in some previous work [15–19]. For example, small size with about 10 nm wide causes the resistivity of metal Cu or Ag interconnect lines to be approximately an order of magnitude larger than that of bulk sample [15,16]. For TiO2 semiconductor films composed of nanoparticles, the electron diffusion coefficient is 103–105 times smaller than that in single crystal films [19]. These phenomena are attributed to the interference of disordered lattices on electron conduction, including grain boundaries and defects in nanostructures. As for the theoretical research, some models, used to quantify the increase of resistance induced by nanosized lattice with coarse surface or grain boundary, were proposed [20]. In recent years, the quantum transport theories based on the Schrödinger equation describe the relationship between the resistance and the structure in a more accurate way [21,22]. It shows that such an increase in resistivity is dominated by weak Anderson localization induced by electron scattering from disordered grain boundaries. Neodymium, similar to other rare earth metals, has strong affinity to hydrogen [23], while in particular, its 4f orbitals contain four electrons, not all of which participate in bonding with hydrogen to form hydride (NdH x ). This special electronic structure makes NdH x a narrower band-gap semiconductor with stronger electronic conductivity compared to LaH x [7]. Hence, it would be interesting and necessary to explore the influences of structural defects on electronic and ionic conductivities of NdH x . In this work, NdH x with different crystalline sizes were prepared by ball milling and subsequent sintering treatments. Rich nanosized grains and defects were observed, which brings down the electronic conductivity of NdH x by 3 orders of magnitude. In addition, deformed CeH x and PrH x were also prepared and measured; similar results to that of deformed NdH x were obtained. This work proves the universality of the “lattice deformation” strategy in suppressing electron conduction of mixed ion/electron conductors for H− conduction. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Cerium (Ce chunk, ZhongNuo Advanced Material, 99%), praseodymium (Pr chunk, ZhongNuo Advanced Material, 99%), and neodymium (Nd powder, Alfa, 99.8%) were used as raw materials without further treatment. Ce chunk and Pr chunk were firstly hydrogenated at 100 °C and 10 bar H2 for 3 h. The products were cold-pressed into pellets and sintered at 700 °C and 60 bar H2 for 10 h in a home-made Sievert system and the samples after sintering were denoted as CeH x -P-700 and PrH x -P-700, respectively. After initial hydrogenation at 100 °C, the samples were ball-milled using a planetary mill (Retsch PM400) at a rotation rate of 200 r min−1 under 20 bar H2 for 2 h. The obtained CeH x and PrH x powders were denoted as BM-CeH x and BM-PrH x . The as-synthesized BM-CeH x and BM-PrH x powders were cold-pressed into pellets and sintered at 700 °C and 60 bar H2 for 10 h, which were denoted as BM-CeH x -700 and BM-PrH x -700. The Nd powder was firstly hydrogenated for 24 h at 150 °C and 40 bar H2. Then the product was cold-pressed into pellets and sintered at 700 °C and 60 bar H2 for 10 h to obtain NdH x -P-700. The Nd powder was directly milled at 20 bar H2 for 2 h to obtain BM-NdH x while the BM-NdH x -500 and BM-NdH x -700 were synthesized in the same way as BM-CeH x -700. All processes were performed in an argon purification glovebox (O2 < 0.01 ppm, H2O < 0.01 ppm). 2.2 Characterization The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples were measured using an X’Pert Pro diffractometer with Cu K α radiation operating at 40 kV and 40 mA at room temperature. The XRD samples were placed on an airtight sample holder to prevent sample oxidation. Microstructural analysis was performed using a JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope (TEM) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The samples were deposited onto carbon holey copper grids. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation was carried on a JSM-7800F microscope. During the sample loading process before testing, the sample has to be exposed to air for approximately 1 min. The H contents of the REH x were determined by acidolysis using hydrochloric acid solution, as used in previous works [14]. The error of H contents determined by this method is around ±0.02. The H-D isotope exchange properties of samples were tested in a home-made temperature programmed system equipped with a mass spectrometer (HPR20, Hiden) with an HD signal of m/z = 3 at 25 and 100 °C. The flow rate of feed gaseous, H2 and D2, is 30 mL min−1. 2.3 Electrochemical measurements The powder samples were pressed into pellets at around 200 MPa with a diameter of 5 mm and a thickness of about 1.2 mm. The total conductivity of the samples was measured by alternating current (AC) impedance spectroscopy using a BioLogic VSP-300 workstation in EIS (electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) mode in the frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz. The direct current (DC) polarization method was conducted to measure the electronic conductivity at a constant voltage of 100 mV. Nickel foam was used as electrodes to decrease the interface resistance. Samples were first cooled at −40 °C and then the measurement was conducted in a temperature range from −40 °C to 20 °C with an interval of 10 °C. The temperature was stabilized at each point for 50 min before testing. 2.4 Calculations The spin-polarized density functional calculations were performed by the Vienna ab initio simulation package [24,25]. The electronic exchange-correlation energy was calculated within the generalized-gradient approximation with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional [26]. The projector augmented wave method was used to describe the electron-ion interactions [27,28], and the one-electron wave function was expanded on the basis of plane waves with the kinetic cutoff energy of 500 eV. The (9 × 9 × 9) Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh was used for the Nd16H46, and the convergence criteria of energy and force were set to be 10−5 eV and 0.03 eV Å−1, respectively. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structures and morphologies of REHx samples Fig. 1 (a) shows the known crystal structures of NdH x , which has both cubic ( Fm 3 ¯ m ) and trigonal ( P 3 ¯ c1 , x ≈ 3) crystalline structures [29]. The latter is a metastable phase at room temperature, while the cubic phase is more stable for NdH x under standard conditions [30,31]. In this work, the Nd powder was firstly ball milled for 2 h at 20 bar H2 to obtain BM-NdH x . The BM-NdH x -500 and BM-NdH x -700 were synthesized by calcining BM-NdH x at 500 and 700 °C, respectively. For comparison, NdH x -P-700 was prepared by directly hydrogenating Nd power and sintered at 700 °C. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the powder XRD patterns of all the prepared NdH x , whose H contents (x) are greater than 2.7 (Table S1), are attributed to the cubic structure with the space group Fm 3 ¯ m . No peaks associated with oxide impurities and trigonal phase were observed. This shows that the methods adopted in this study favor the formation of the more stable cubic structure. The full widths at half maximum (FWHM) of diffraction peaks at low angles are compared and used to estimate the mean crystallite sizes of samples using the Scherrer equation. Compared with high-temperature sintered samples without ball milling treatment (NdH x -P-700), NdH x after ball milling (BM-NdH x ) has weaker and broader diffraction peaks, indicating a smaller mean crystallite size, about 13 nm. Subsequent sintering leads to significant narrowing of the XRD peaks and the sintering at 500 °C results in a sample (BM-NdH x -500) with a crystallite size of about 50 nm. The SEM images of Nd powder and BM-NdH x samples are presented in Fig. 1(c and d), respectively. It can be seen that upon mechanochemical hydrogenation, the flaky Nd metal converts to the BM-NdH x powders with sizes of only about 200 to 300 nm. The SEM images of BM-NdH x -500 and BM-NdH x -700 (Fig. S1) show similar particle sizes to that of NdH x -BM, indicating that sintering does not cause significant agglomeration of the sample particles. In Fig. 2 (a), the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization, on the other hand, clearly shows that the particles of BM-NdH x consist of differently oriented crystallites with sizes between 10 and 15 nm, which keep in line with the results from XRD characterization. It is easily observed that rich grain boundaries and defects exist intricately in the lattice. Subsequent sintering at 500 °C results in grain growth to about 60 nm and a corresponding reduction in the number of grain boundaries and defects (Fig. 2b). After sintering at 700 °C, most grains are larger than 100 nm, from which some crystallographic discontinuous regions of lattice fringes can still be found (Fig. 2c and d). In addition, the TEM images of CeH x and PrH x are also presented in Figs. S2 and S3, respectively. Ball milling and sintering treatments have similar effects on all the samples, while it should be noted that even after sintering at 700 °C, the grain sizes of BM-CeH x -700 and BM-PrH x -700 are still about 40 to 50 nm, which is different from that of BM-NdH x -700. To summarize, nanosized REH x with numerous grain boundaries and defects were prepared by high-energy ball milling. Varying the sintering temperatures, NdH x with different crystallite sizes were obtained. Based on earlier findings, grain boundaries and lattice defects strongly interfere with the electron transport in the lattice. As shown in TEM, the crystallite sizes of the samples are comparable to the optimal length scale, at which electron scattering produces appreciable effects; therefore, we next explored the electronic properties of these materials. 3.2 The electrical properties of REHx samples The effect of ball milling on the electronic properties of the samples was evaluated firstly by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflectance spectra tests, as shown in Fig. 3 (a). NdH x -P-700 shows a nearly total absorption of incident light in the full test spectral range, which is consistent with a narrow band gap semiconductor. In fact, the band gap of REH x is close to 0 eV when it is nearly hydrogen saturated [7,32]. On the contrary, the BM-NdH x sample exhibits obvious absorption in the same range of spectrum, indicating that ball milling can broaden the band gap of NdH x (as shown in the electronic structure in Fig. S4). Furthermore, several strange sharp peaks are observed in the wavelength range of 700–900 nm, which may be attributed to lattice or surface defects resulting from strong collision and shear force during ball milling, and the absence of these peaks in the sample without BM (NdH x -P-700) also supports this inference. Then, the electronic conductivity of REH x prepared under different treating conditions was measured by the direct current (DC) polarization method, as shown in Fig. 3(b–d). All the samples exhibit positive temperature coefficients of electronic conductivity in the whole testing temperature range. No temperature-dependent metal-semiconductor transition was observed, which indicates that all the samples are semiconductors with relatively high H contents [33,34]. The electronic conductivity of the samples directly hydrogenated without being ball milled (REH x -P-700) is about 10−1 S cm−1 at room temperature (RT). Because these samples synthesized from tableted powders have certain grain boundaries and defects, their conductivity is slightly lower than that of the well-crystallized counterparts as reported in the literatures [7,35]. After ball milling, the electronic conductivity decreases to about 10−3 S cm−1 for CeH x and PrH x and most obviously to about 10−4 S cm−1 for NdH x at RT. This large difference in electronic conductivity is also reflected in DC polarization curves. Taking NdH x as an example (Fig. 3e), the terminal polarization current of the BM-NdH x is three orders of magnitude lower than that of the NdH x -P-700 with the same dimension. Further, after sintering at 700 °C, the electronic conductivity of the BM-CeH x and the BM-PrH x increases by an order of magnitude, while sintering temperature has a stronger influence on BM-NdH x sample, i.e., sintering at about 500 °C will enhance the electronic conductivity by an order of magnitude, and sintering at 700 °C results in 4 orders of magnitude increase in electronic conductivity. Moreover, the different degrees of interference of nanosized grains and defects on electron migration are also indicated by the apparent activation energy determined by the slope of the Arrhenius’s plots [36]. Fig. 3(f) shows the activation energies of electron migration of NdH x . BM-NdH x has the highest activation energy, about 0.39 eV, reflecting that the rich grain boundaries and defects in the lattice significantly hinder the transport of electrons. Increasing sintering temperature leads to the growth of grains and lower activation energy. According to the above results, it is evident that the electron conduction in REH x is strongly influenced by microstructures, including defect concentration, grain sizes, and so on. This fact is once more verified for hydrides of Ce, Pr, and Nd, not only for La. The mechanism has been studied by classical and quantum mechanics, respectively, based on Boltzmann transport equation and Schrodinger's equation. In classical Mayadas-Shatzkes (M-S) theory [20], the grain boundary is simplified as a planar wave, which plays a role in electron scattering and disturbing the transport of electrons. The resistivity of the materials increases with reducing of the grain size. Such an effect is more pronounced when the grain size is comparable to or below the mean free path of electron, owing to the increased probability of electron scattering on the surface and at the grain boundary. In addition, the motion state of electron and the disorder degree of lattice are described by the quantum transport theory [22] in a more accurate way. The wave function of electron is affected by the lattice potential, causing the Schrodinger's equation to be solvable only in special locations. It means the electron localization, which hinders the electron conduction. The electronic conductivity decreases with increasing the disorder degree of lattice, similar to the conclusion of classical theory. In order to further examine the electronic properties of NdH x , the electron localization function (ELF) of Nd16H46 was analyzed in the xy plane, as shown in Fig. S5. The regions with ELF values below 0.3 between Nd and H atoms indicate that the Nd atom forms ionic bonds with the surrounding H atoms. 3.3 Hydride ion conductivity In general, nanosized grains and defects tend to affect the migration of both electrons and ions, and thus we investigated the H− conduction performances of all samples. Fig. 4 (a) shows the H-D exchange result of the BM-NdH x at RT. It is observed that the H-D exchange occurred facilely at room temperature when the carrier gas was switched between H2 and D2, indicating that H− ions migrate easily in the BM-NdH x . Subsequent temperature programmed desorption (TPD) curves of the deuterated product are shown in Fig. S6. The TPD decomposition products are mainly D2 and HD, indicating that most of octahedral H atoms can be replaced by D atoms at room temperature. Then, the ionic conductivity of NdH x , CeH x , and PrH x was measured by the alternating current (AC) impedance methods in EIS mode. Fig. 4(b) shows the complex impedance plot for BM-NdH x sample, which exhibits clear relaxation process arising from ionic transport. The ionic conductivity was obtained from R ct in the equivalent circuit. The Arrhenius plots of ionic conductivity of NdH x samples and the comparison of ionic conductivity of REH x at RT are shown in Fig. 4(c and d). The ionic conductivity of BM-NdH x is about 8 × 10−5 S cm−1 at RT, while after sintering at 500 °C, it increases to about 2.86 × 10−4 S cm−1, with a diffusion barrier decreasing from 0.16 to 0.13 eV. In addition, BM-CeH x exhibits faster H− conduction, about 1.51 × 10−3 S cm−1 (Fig. S7), slightly lower than that of BM-LaH x [14] but about four orders of magnitude higher than that of BaH2 (about 10−7 S cm−1) at room temperature [36]. The EIS method is not suitable for measuring H− conductivity of the non-ball-milling samples because of their strong electron conduction. In order to compare the H− diffusion rates of the NdH x before and after ball milling, we performed H-D exchange tests on the same amount of the two samples at 100 °C. In Fig. S8, the NdH x before and after ball milling have similar H-D exchange behaviors, indicating that their H− diffusion rates are almost the same. The above results show that the ball milling process does not obviously bring down the hydride ion conduction, which is different from the effect on the electron conduction. High H− ion conductivity would enable BM-REH x to be applied in many research fields such as separation membranes, membrane reactors, and gas sensors, which will play important roles in addressing energy and environmental concerns. Further efforts are given to these materials to increase the ion transfer numbers (about 0.7) to above 0.99 to enable them to be potential H− solid electrolyte materials. 4 Conclusions This work validates the effectiveness of “structural deformation” strategy on suppressing electron conduction of mixed ion/electron conductors. We investigated a few electron-predominant f-electron borne rare earth hydrides REH x (RE = Nd, Ce, and Pr) and demonstrated that the electronic conductivity of these REH x can be suppressed by about 2–4 orders of magnitude in the temperature range of −40–20 °C by tuning microstructures of materials. Encouragingly, this method would not bring about obvious deterioration of ion conduction. At room temperature, H− ionic conductivity and migration number are about 10−4–10−3 S cm−1 and 0.7 for the REH x , respectively, indicating that they are promising candidates for hydride ion conductors. This finding provides a route for systematically altering and eventually controlling the ion migration in narrow band-gap materials.
