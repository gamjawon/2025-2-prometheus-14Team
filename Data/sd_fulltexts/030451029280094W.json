M. Choudary** and S. Shobha Rani Homogeneous Catalysis Discipline, Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, Hyderabad 500 007 (India) (Received July 22, 1991; revised March 16, 1992) Use of solid catalysts in liquid phase reactions for selective organic transformations affording fine chemicals has been relatively unexplored, although innumerable examples of vapour phase reactions are available, especially for the manufacture of petroleum and commodity chemicals. Pillared clays, obtained by the intercalation of transition metal oxy/hydroxy species in oligomeric form in smectite clays, have been recently subjected to liquid phase catalysis for selective organic transformations [ 1-3 [. The advantages envisaged in the use of pillared clay catalysts over conventional heterogeneous catalysts include relatively uniform size and shape, especially when preformed oligomers are used for intercalation, and non-migration of the species on the surface of support during calcination in the pillared clays, which have high thermal stability and more approachable active sites. As expected, pillared clays have shown higher activity and selectivity in organic reactions such as oxidations and epoxidations [2, 3[. The development of efficient methods for the selective oxidation of sulphides to sulphoxides has been sought for many years. Reagents such as hydrogen peroxide [4], m-chloro-perbenzoic acid [5], sodium metaperiodate [6, 7],bromine [8], nitrogen tetraoxide [9], oxaziridine [ 1fl], benzene seleninic peracid [ 11 ], sulphinyl peroxy compound [ 12 ] or transition metal complexes [ 13-15 ] in the presence of organoperoxide as oxidants have been developed for the oxidation of sulphides. Many of these systems are associated with disadvantages such as formation of sulphones, unsatisfactory yields (especially in the case of substrate possessing a strong electron-withdrawing group like NO2, e.g. 4-nitro-methylphenyl sulphide), long reaction hours and tedious workup procedures. It was thus felt that there is a need to develop a catalyst which can terminate the oxidation at the sulphoxide stage selectively without *IICT communication No. 2873. \"Author to whom correspondence should O addressed. 0304-5102/92/$ 5.00 0 1992 - Elsevier Sequoia. All rights reserved LS further oxidation of sulphoxides to sulphones. In the present article we report an efficient catalytic system, vanadium pillared clay (V-PILC) as catalyst and t-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as oxidant, for the highly selective oxidation of sulphides to sulphoxides for the first time in liquid phase reactions with good yields. Results are compared with the best systems described earlier. The Na-montmorillonite, which was prepared from natural montmorillonite Missouri (mineral depositing, University of Missouri), a class of smectite clay, by the procedure of Posner and Quirk [ 161, was treated with 0.1 N HCl to afford H-montmorillonite [ 17 ] . V-PILL was synthesised as described earlier [ 2 ] by refluxing VOCl3 (0.5 ml) in dry benzene (70 ml) with H-montmorillonite (5 g) under nitrogen until the solid clay suspension turned a deep bottle green colour (~ 6 h). The solid was filtered under nitrogen atmosphere, washed repeatedly with dry benzene and moist air was passed over. It was oven dried at 110 C for 6 h and analysed. The clay was thus intercalated with 14ss'o by weight of vanadium according to plasma analysis for metal atoms. An X-ray diffraction study of V-PILC showed (001) spacing of 22.9 A, revealing an expansion from the 9.6 A of anhydrous montmorillonite. This expansion is due to the intercalation of polymeric vanadia species. Using the Brunauer-Emznett-Teller (BET) method, the surface area of V-PILC before thermal treatment was calculated as 11.6 mz g-1 and pore size distribution or average pore diameter was found to be 44.33 A, with a pore volume of 0.106 cm' g` 1. The surface area after thermal treatment at 450 C for 6 h was calculated as 47.6 m2 g- 1. The ESR spectrum of V-PILC showed a well-resolved hyperfine splitting due to \"V (I= 7/2) with g1=2.040 and gq =1.970 due to the dispersed V4+ species formed in the pillar [ 181. A general procedure for the impregnated catalysts is as follows: silica-, alumina- and montmorillonite-supported vanadia catalysts with 14 wt.% vanadia loading were prepared by the standard wet-impregnation method [ 191. Ammonium metavanadate (Fluka, AR grade) was used as the source of vanadia. The impregnated catalysts were dried at 110 C for 6 h and calcined in air at 450 C for 6 h. The oxidation of p-tolyl methyl sulphide was carried out as follows. To the V-PILC or other vanadia impregnated catalysts (0.05 mmol V content) in 50 ml of dichloromethane (DCM), p-tolyl methyl sulphide (5 mmol) and t-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) (5.5 mmol) in toluene were added and the reaction mixture was stirred for 1.5 h at room temperature. In asymmetric sulphoxidation, the procedure described above was used but (+)-diethyl tartrate (DET) (0.36 mmol) was added along with the catalyst and stirred for 3 h at - 20 C. The reaction mixture was then filtered and the filtrate concentrated and chromatographed on silica gel (EtOAc:hexane 1:1), revealing an oxidation product with > 98% yield in both procedures and an enantiomeric excess (e.e.) of 25% in the asymmetric reaction. Mass, IR and 1H NMR spectra indicated that the oxidation product was p-tolyl L9 TABLE 1 Selective and asymmetric oxidation of sulphides by V-PILC Entry R R' Time Chemical e.e. no.

The e.e. of the isolated sulphoxide was determined by polarimetric measurement. The oxidation reaction proceeded rapidly using V-PILC as catalyst, TBHP as oxidant and substrate in DCM, giving sulphoxides in excellent yields. V-PILC, TBHP ~R, 0 C M _ R,S\"R, Room Temperature The reused catalyst, after simple filtration, displayed consistent selectivity for four recycles, as is shown in Table 1. Easy workup, no formation of sulphones and higher yields, even in the case of 4-nitromethyl phenyl sulphide, are added advantages. The method described here has overcome many disadvantages associated with the systems mentioned earlier. The reaction could be completed within 1.5 h using 1 mol% catalyst, giving sulphoxides selectively in excellent yields and thus demonstrating that the present catalyst is very active in transferring oxygen from TBHP to dialkyl and aryl sulphides. The results are very impressive (Table 1) when compared with the reactions induced by transition metal complexes, with the aid of organic peroxide employed either stoichiometrically [ 13 ] or using 10 mol% of the complexes [ 14, 15 ].

On the other hand, the catalyst with transition metal complexes, which include V, Mo, Ti, Cu, Co, Fe of N-salicylidene-L-amino acids, reported by Colonna et al. [ 15 ] afforded only 16-5496 of sulphoxides and 5-49ss'o of sulphones with a reaction time of 16 to 23 h. The present results indicate there was no formation of sulphones during oxidation of the sulphides with the present catalytic system, and only sulphoxides were formed selectively. Various catalysts using V205 as such and supported on alumina, silica and montmorillonite synthesised by the impregnation method have been compared with pillared montmorillonite clay catalysts using different sources of montmorillonite in oxidation of sulphides in terms of selectivity and activity in order to understand the nature of the active species involved in the oxidation reactions. The dismal performance in the selective oxidation of sulphides to sulphoxides displayed by VO(acac)2, V205 as such and supported on alumina, silica and even on montmorillonite, is evident in Table 2. In contrast, the vanadium pillared clays obtained by interaction Of VOC13 and H+-montmorillonite before thermal treatment in oxygen gave amazingly good yields, almost quantitative with high selectivity. However, the catalyst after thermal treatment showed surprisingly poor performance (entry No. 11 in Table 2), despite the increase in surface area. The ESR and 51V NMR [20] studies on precalcined pillared clay catalyst indicated that V4+, present in the hydroxy oxide oligomer intercalated in montmorillonite, is in a highly dispersed state, while NMR of the intercalated montmorillonite species showed the crystalline formation of V205 on thermal treatment in oxygen. A silicasupported catalyst prepared by the interaction of VOC13 on silica using the identical method adopted for the preparation of the pillared clay catalyst showed poor performance in the oxidation of sulphides to sulphoxides (entry No. 6 in Table 2). In summary, these results provided evidence that: (a) V205 on any support is not active; (b) vanadium hydroxyoxide oligomer, predictably formed on silica, is also inactive; (c) the activity and selectivity are not related with the surface area; (d) vanadium hydroxyoxide oligomer intercalated in montmorillonite is the true active species responsible for the highly selective and active oxidation of sulphides to sulphoxides. Therefore, the high activity exhibited by the pillared clay may be attributed to the ease of complexation of TBHP with vanadium hydroxyoxide species and sulphides and the facile delivery of oxygen to form sulphoxides. The high selectivity towards the formation of sulphoxides is attributed due to the high nucleophilicity of sulphides over sulphoxides, which favours the complexation of sulphides with vanadium and TBHP and the subsequent selective oxidation. Further, a role for montmorillonite in the selective oxidation of sulphides to sulphoxides cannot be ruled out. The usefulness of the optically active sulphoxides in asymmetric synthesis of organic compounds prompted us to study the present catalyst in asymmetric sulphoxidation using chiral auxiliary (+)-DET/TBHP at -20 C. Although the chemical yields are very impressive, the enantiomeric excess (e.e.) is only 16-25%. However this is the first heterogeneous catalyst showing even such e.e. for asymmetric sulphur oxidations. ~~%,,Sloop - V-PILC,TBHP - i'.,S'0 R/ \\R` (+)-DET, DCM,-206 R/ \\RI In conclusion, the catalytic system described here is an efficient and convenient method for the oxidation of sulphides, with the advantages of high activity, selectivity, re-usability, easy workup by simple filtration and short reaction times. The system could become a practical alternative for the oxidation of sulphides to racemic sulphoxides without further oxidation to sulphones, and forms the first heterogeneous catalyst for this reaction. Further work directed towards the development of an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for asymmetric oxidation of sulphides to sulphoxides is under progress. Acknowledgement We thank Dr. A. V.
