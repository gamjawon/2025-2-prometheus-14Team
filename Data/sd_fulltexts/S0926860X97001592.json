This was attributed to the beneficial effect of the co- catalyst on the nature of the coke formed in the zeolite particles. In fact, with both Zn and Ga hybrid catalyst systems, it was observed that the coke species formed were 'light'coke having a paraffinic nature, in contrast with the more aromatic 'heavy' coke produced by the parent zeolite. Particularly with n-butane feed, it was the nature of the coke formed which determined the activity and stability of the catalyst since both catalysts produced nearly equal amounts of coke under the same reaction conditions. As a general result of this study, the lighter the coke formed, the more aromatic the product stream and the higher the on-stream catalyst stability. 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

PII S0926-860X(97)001 59-2 some supported metals [1] should be as thoroughly understood as possible before any other steps are taken with respect to the catalyst selection and process design. When microporous and acidic materials such as zeolites are used as catalysts for reactions which are carried out at relatively high temperatures, the forma- tion of heavy hydrocarbons which can be rapidly converted into coke is often a nightmare for research- ers in the applied field. Fluid cracking catalysis using microporous zeolites as active components is a good example where all the detrimental factors mentioned earlier coexist [2]. For almost all hydrocarbon catalytic processes, coke typically consists of polyaromatic condensed- ring structure [1]. For most of these reactions, it was 82 R. Le Van Mao et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 164 (1997) 81-89 pointed out [3,4] that when zeolites are used, coke formation - itself acid-catalyzed - probably occurs through the same steps. In particular, the ZSM-5 zeolite with interconnecting channels of intermediate size exhibits a shape-selectivity in the coke formation similar to that of the product formation. Thus, the amount of coke formed in the ZSM-5 pore network, when compared to other larger pore sized zeolites, should be small [5]. However, the effect of pore blockage on the diffusivity of both the reactant and product molecules may result in rapid activity decay [6]. Recently, Guisnet and Gnep [7] reported several interesting results obtained at high reaction tempera- tures (>400): (a) part of the coke was insoluble in methylene chloride; (b) there were probably two modes of growth of coke molecules, i.e. the classical coke and the coke formed by dehydrogenative cou- pling of polyaromatic molecules; and (c) gallium had practically no effect on the coke composition. In the case of the aromatization of low alkanes and alkenes [8-10], it was found that the hybrid config- uration of the catalyst was responsible for much higher aromatization activity, when compared to the mono- component configuration of the parent ZSM-5 zeolite, owing to the joint 'hydrogen back spillover (HBS)/ bifunctional catalysis' action. The latter is manifested at the interface of the zeolite particles and the Zn or Ga containing co-catalyst aggregates [10]. This also con- tributes to a more rapid removal of bulky aromatic compounds produced in the zeolite pore system before their conversion into coke [8-10]. Thus, this study aims at correlating the nature of the coke formed in the ZSM-5 particles in both catalyst configurations with the product stream composition. This will also help to explain the enhancement of stability related to the hybrid catalyst configuration, since zeolite coking and catalyst deactivation (aging) are interrelated pro- cesses. Various techniques were used in the past to study catalyst coking. These included the use of hydrocar- bon mixtures as feeds [11], IR spectroscopy [12] and CP/MAS 13NMR [3,13]. In this work, the procedure of investigation consisted of determining the conversion and product selectivity (desorbing species), and the amount and nature of the species trapped in the solid catalyst for both the parent zeolite and the hybrid catalyst which had been tested under the same reaction conditions.

Experimental 2.1. Preparation and characterization of the ZSM-5 zeolites and the co-catalysts Two ZSM-5 zeolite samples with Si/AI atom ratios of 43 and 36, respectively, were synthesized, con- verted to the acid powder forms (called hereafter HZ(43) and HZ(36), respectively) and characterized [8,9,14,15]. The Zn containing co-catalyst (called hereafter Zn/A1) was obtained by co-precipitation of ZnO and A1203 (Zn/AI=I) as described in [8,14]. The Ga containing co-catalyst (called hereafter Ga/LuSi) was obtained by co-precipitation of Ga203 and colloidal silica (Ludox, from Dupont) as described in [9,15]. 'Pure' ZnO and Ga203 used as co-catalysts were obtained by the methods described in [14,15], respec- tively. Table 1 reports some physico-chemical properties of the samples mentioned earlier, as well as, the 'pure' ZnO and Ga203. 3. Preparation of the final catalysts The parent zeolite powders, HZ(43) and HZ(36), were extruded with bentonite as a binder (20 wt%), then dried and activated as described in [8,9,14,15]. The final catalysts are hereafter called HZ(43) and HZ(36), respectively. The hybrid catalysts were prepared as follows: R. Le Van Mao et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 164 (1997) 81-89 83 1. Hybrid catalyst for testing with ethylene. HZ (43) (84.4 wt%) and Zn/A1 co-precipitate (5.6 wt%) both in powder form were mechanically mixed at room temperature. Bentonite clay (10 wt%) used as binder was then incorporated and intimately mixed with the solid catalyst. The extrusion operation and the activation of the final hybrid catalyst (hereafter called HZ//(Zn/A1)) were car- ried out in accordance with the method described in [8,14,16]. 2. Hybrid catalyst for testing with n-butane. HZ(36) (80 wt%) and Ga/LuSi co-catalyst (16 wt%), both in powder form, were mechanically mixed at room temperature. Bentonite (4 wt%) was then incorpo- rated and intimately mixed with the solid catalyst. The extrusion operation and the activation of the final hybrid catalyst (hereafter called HZ//(Ga/ LuSi)) were carried out in accordance with the method described in [9,10,15]. 4. Catalytic testing The experimental set-ups for the catalytic testing with ethylene and n-butane were identical to those described in [14,15], respectively. The reaction para- meters were as follows: (i) Aromatization of ethylene. Temperature----540, partial pressure of ethylene=0.08 atm (unless other- wise specified), partial pressure of nitrogen (used as carrier gas)=balance, total flow-rate=50 ml/min, cat- alyst weight--0.5 g, duration of a run--3 h. (ii) Aromatization of n-butane. Temperature= 540, WHSV (Weight hourly space velocity or g of injected n-butane per hour and per g of cat- alyst)=0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 h-l, flow-rate of nitrogen (used as carrier gas)=10 ml/min, weight of catalyst--4 g, duration of a run=3.5 h. The procedures for catalyst testing and analysis of the products of the aromatization of ethylene and n- butane were similar to those described in [8,14,16] and [9,10,15], respectively. The total conversion of ethylene or n-butane, Ct, is calculated as follows: Ct (C atom%)=100. [(NC)r-(NC)p]/(NC)f, where (NC)f and (NC)p are the numbers of carbon atoms of ethylene or n-butane in the feed and in the reactor outstream, respectively. The selectivity (Si) in product hydrocarbon (i) is defined as follows: Si (C atom%)=100. (NC)i/ [(NC)f-(NC)p], where (NC)i is the number of carbon atoms of hydrocarbon (i) in the reactor outstream. , 1. . . Study of the nature of coke in used catalysts Thermal gravimetric (TGA) and differential thermal (DTA) analyses were carried out using a PL Thermal Sc. Model STA 1500 apparatus (combined TGA/DTA system, average size of the sample=13-18 mg; heating rate=15/min) in air atmosphere. TGA results provided informa- tion regarding the amount of coke decomposed/ burnt off from the used catalyst and the corre- sponding average temperature (approximate value given by the CRT Plot software). This temperature was also determined using the value of the maximum of the DTA peak, and was found to be coincident with the TGA result (within 5 error margin). In the following, the coke species were assumed to be formed only in the zeolite component of the hybrid catalyst because TGA on the corresponding used co-catalyst or bentonite clay, tested under the same reaction conditions as the hybrid catalyst, did not show any significant amount of coke formed. In the case of the aromatization of ethylene, the high amount of coke species formed in the parent ZSM-5 zeolite, HZ(43), allowed the desorption of these species using diethyl ether as solvent (mild stirring at ambient temperature for 48 h). The desorbed compounds were analyzed by gas chro- matography using a HP PONA column. In the case of the aromatization of n-butane, the low amount of coke formed in both parent and Ga bearing hybrid catalyst required an in-situ study of the used catalysts using the CP/MAS solid state 13C NMR. Spectra were obtained at room temperature by using a Chemagnetics CMR-300 NMR spectro- meter at frequency of 75.5 MHz. The rate of the magic angle spinning was ca. 4 KHz and the pulse sequence used was the conventional one with a contact time of 1 ms and a plus delay of 3 s. 2 K data points were acquired and zero-filled to 4 K prior to Fourier transform. Chemical shifts were referenced to tetramethylsilane (TMS) by setting 84 R. Le Van Mao et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 164 (1997) 81-89 the methyl resonance of hexamethylbenzene as 17.4 ppm. 6. Results and discussion First, it is worth mentioning that coke formation in zeolites occurs through the following common steps [3,4]: olefins (or olefins from paraffins), oligomeriza- tion of the olefinic cracking products, cyclization of the oligomers, transformation through hydrogen trans- fer into monoaromatics, alkylation of these monoaro- matics and then cyclization and hydrogen transfer to give diaromatics, triaromatics, etc. In the following, we would like to present sepa- rately the results obtained with two different feeds: ethylene and n-butane. The reason lies in the fact that under similar reaction conditions the amount of coke formed with ethylene as feed was much higher than that with n-butane as feed since olefins are more reactive as coke formers than paraffins. This allowed the use of the technique of solvent desorption from the used catalysts. However, for the aromatization of n-butane, 'in situ' techniques of investigation of the used catalysts were needed.

Coking of the ZSM-5 zeolite and the Zn containing hybrid catalyst with ethylene as feed Tables 2 and 3 report the catalytic results obtained with the parent ZSM-5 zeolite (HZ(43)) and the hybrid catalyst (HZ(43)//Zn,A1). Such results can be summarized as follows: 1. Under the same reaction conditions, the hybrid catalyst provided an ethylene conversion and an aromatic selectivity much higher than the parent zeolite (Table 2, columns 1 and 2). Even at comparable conversions (Table 2, columns 1 and 3), hybrid catalyst showed a higher aromatizing activity. 2. With the hybrid catalyst, the selectivity to paraffins longer than methane was fairly high when com- pared to the selectivity to propylene/butenes (Table 2). Completely opposite results were obtained with the parent zeolite. Moreover, at comparable conversions, the hybrid catalyst pro- duced much more C2-C4 paraffins than the parent Distribution of aromatic products Benzene 31.1 53.1 Toluene 46.3 30.0 Ethylbenzene 4.3 1.4 Xylenes 14.8 6.6 Styrene 2.9 1.0 C+ aromatics 3.2 8.0 Distribution of C~ aromatics C9 aromatics 68.3 41.3 Naphthalene 4.9 17.6 Other C10 aromatics 20.9 13.3 Naphthalene, 2-methyl 5.2 21.1 Naphthalene, 1-methyl 0.4 2.6 Other C+t aromatics 0.4 4.1 Coke formed (wt%) 3.3 1.4 zeolite (Table 2). Thus, it was suggested at first [8] that the hybrid catalyst showed a dealkylation activity higher than that of the parent zeolite. Indeed, there was more benzene and less toluene/xylenes produced with the hybrid catalyst R.

However, the extremely low production of methane by the hybrid catalyst did not support the idea of a general and higher dealkylating activity of the hybrid catalyst. On the other hand, the fairly weak redox propensity of the (Zn/AI) co- catalyst itself [8] could not account for the reduc- tion of a significant amount of reactant ethylene molecules. Instead, the high production of the C2- C4 paraffins with the hybrid catalyst was the direct consequence of a more efficient hydrogen transfer in the aromatization step [17,18] and a more rapid desorption of the C2-C4 paraffins and aromatics, owing to the presence of the co-catalyst. 3. The amount of coke formed on the parent zeolite was much higher than that produced by the hybrid catalyst (Table 3 and Fig. 1) catalyst. As a conse- quence, the latter catalyst exhibited a higher on- stream stability [8]. On the other hand, the reaction outstream of the hybrid catalyst, when compared to the parent zeolite, contained much higher amounts of the C+t hydrocarbons (Table 3 and [8]). This can be ascribed to a more rapid build-up of the coke in the case of the parent zeolite, which by narrowing the apertures of the pores, resulted in an outstream poorer in the bulky C+ aromatics (sieving effect) (Table 3). The explanation which seems plausible is as fol- lows: (a) The parent zeolites exhibit surface areas which comprise also those corresponding to the zeolite mesopores (pores having sizes larger than 2 nm) (Table 1 and [8,9]). These mesopores are the portions of the zeolite channels, which are near the pore open- ings. Most of the coke is produced in this region owing to the lack of size constraints. (b) co-catalysts which are irreducible oxides (quartz, silica, silica-alumina and alumina with var- ious acido-basic properties) provide more \"surfaces\" for transferring the coke produced in the mesoporous region of the zeolite particles as previously shown. Thus, a higher aromatic production and a better cata- lyst stability were observed [19,20]. (c) the presence of the Zn species on the (Zn/A1) co- catalyst surface increased furthermore the aromatic production and the catalyst stability [8,14], owing to the transfer of some reduced Zn species from the co- catalyst to the zeolite mesopores. Such a transfer was also observed by Osako et al. [21] who hypothesized a solid-solid ion-exchange of Zn cations. Therefore, the sink effect of the co-catalyst (section b) and the bifunctional action of the active sites in the region of the pore openings (section c) [10] succeed to free the zeolite mesopores in a more efficient way than when the zeolite does not contain any co-catalyst. In fact, the analysis of the 'coke' trapped in the parent zeolite and desorbed with diethyl ether, revealed a large quantity of bulky C~- aromatics as shown in Table 4. In addition, the temperatures of coke com- bustion for the parent zeolite and the hybrid catalysts, as determined by both DTA and TGA techniques, were 595 and 535, respectively. This means that the coke formed in the hybrid catalyst was comprised of hydrogen-richer compounds. It is worth noting that the amount of coke formed in the co-catalyst alone was very low when compared with that formed in the Table 4 Composition of C9~ aromatics trapped in the parent ZSM-5 zeolite [HZ(43)] and desorbed with diethyl ether (wt%) Benzene, isopropyl 31.4 Other C9 aromatics 29.2 Naphthalene 26.3 Other C10 aromatics 9.7 Naphthalene, 1-methyl (and others) 3.4 86 R.

Such a coke did not contain a significant amount of C~-1 aromatics [8]. 8. Coking of the ZSM-5 zeolite and the Ga containing hybrid catalyst with n-butane as feed 8.1. Coke formation in the parent ZSM-5 zeolite (HZ(36)) There was a dramatic decrease in the conversion of n-butane and a significant change in the product selectivity after 22 h of reaction (Table 5). Fig. 2 (both TGA and DTA curves) shows that the coke was burnt off at 585 (858 K). In agreement with the conclusion of [22], ammonia TPD reports a decrease of acid density from 0.43 to 0.37 ~tmol/g [8] resulting essentially from the 'disappearance' of some of the strongest acid sites. The CP/MAS 13C NMR spectrum of used parent zeolite (Fig. 3) shows that most of the resonance peaks are located in the aromatic/olefinic region (100--160 ppm) as assigned by Weitkamp and Maixner [13]. Finally, it is worth noting that the amount of coke formed with n-butane as feed (Table 5, 1.1 wt% for 1 run) was much lower than that formed with ethylene as feed (Table 3, 3.3 wt% for 1 run) for almost the same reaction time (3.5 h versus 3 h with ethylene). 99.9 /%b- -3 t- 97.6 J .a, I 96.4 I -8 200 400 600 800 T Fig. 2.

Le Van Mao et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 164 (1997) 81-89 87 8.2. Coke formation in the hybrid catalyst (HZ(36)// ( Ga/LuSi ) ) In the aromatization of n-butane [9], in contrast with the parent H-ZSM-5 zeolite, there was no significant activity decay for the hybrid catalyst after more than 12 h of reaction (less than 3%, i.e. within experimental error margin). Thus the presence of the co-catalyst in the hybrid catalyst induced a hydrogen back spillover action [8,9] which by combination with the bifunctional catalytic activity of the Ga species [10], provided very high perfor- mance in the aromatization of n-butane (Table 5). By considering the composition of the C~- aromatic pro- ducts, the hybrid catalyst appeared to be much more efficient than the parent zeolite in the removal of the heavy aromatic compounds (Table 6). Thus, what remained in the zeolite component of the used hybrid catalyst (runs performed under the same reaction conditions), when compared to the used parent zeolite, was the following: 1. An almost equal amount of coke (under the same reaction conditions: 1.1 versus 0.9 wt% for the parent zeolite, Table 5). It is worth mentioning that the co-catalyst did not show any significant coke formation after one reaction run.

A coke which can be burnt off at a lower tempera- ture 545 (Fig. 3) versus 585 for the parent zeolite (Fig. 2), i.e. coke species having a hydro- gen-richer composition. 3. A coke of paraffinic nature. In fact, the CP/MAS 13C NMR spectrum of the hybrid catalyst, HZ//Ga/ LuSi, shows two strong resonance peaks in the paraffinic region (0-50 ppm, Fig. 4), according to Ref. [13]. It is worth noting that the mechanism of coke formation in zeolites [3,4] is very similar to that of aromatic production from alkanes (and alkenes) [17,18,23]. Therefore, by taking into consideration the facts previously reported, we can infer that: (a) the coke found in the hybrid catalyst, HZ(36)// Ga/LuSi, is actually oligomeric intermediates of the aromatization reaction still trapped in the catalyst or 'light' coke in a relatively early stage of formation. (b) The coke found in the parent zeolite, HZ(36), is heavy aromatic products of the aromatization reaction or 'heavy' coke, i.e. coke in a relatively deeper stage of formation. In fact, these alkylaromatics (and poly- aromatics) result from a fairly advanced step of the mechanism of coke formation [3,4]. The question is why there was such a difference in the nature of the coke. In a series of articles recently published [24], it was pointed out that 'Whatever the zeolite (used), relatively small polyaromatic mole- cules were formed from propene through successive steps including oligomerization, cyclization, hydro- gen transfer and alkylation. These molecules which were trapped in the supercages (of the Y zeolite), were transformed to bulky polyaromatic molecules located at the surface or in the mesopores of the zeolite crystallites'. Similar results were reported by Chen and Bridger [25] who observed that with the parent HZSM-5 zeolite, 'most oligomerization reaction took place at the outer surface of the zeolite, and complex product structures resulted'. Therefore, one of the main answers to our problem can be found in the distribution of heavy products in the reaction out- stream. In fact, since there is no difference in the mechanism of formation of aromatics with both cata- lysts, the hybrid catalyst configuration is the key factor which allows the rapid evacuation of aromatic products before they undergo further alkylation/multi- ring cyclization in the pore system (probably in the 88 R. Le Van Mao et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 164 (1997) 81-89 ppm Fig. 4. CP/MAS 13C NMR spectra of: (a) =used hybrid catalyst, HZ(36)//Ga/LuSi, and (b) =used parent zeolite, HZ(36). Feed: n-butane. mesopore region of the ZSM-5 particles) or on the particle surface, as occurring with the parent zeolite having a lower evacuation capacity for aromatic spe- cies. Even embedding the zeolite particles in more or less inert solid diluents can improve the zeolite activ- ity/stability [26,27]. With the hybrid configuration, the region of the 'zeolite/co-catalyst' interface is of utmost importance because Zn or Ga species can be transferred from the co-catalyst surface to the pore opening region of the zeolite, resulting in new bifunc- tional type sites [10]. Supported (Zn/A1) and (Ga/ LuSi) co-catalysts were shown to be more effective than the pure ZnO [14] and Ga203 [28], respectively because the Zn or Ga species, already well dispersed on a support with larger surface area (Table 1), are transferred in a higher metal dispersion configuration, to the zeolite component [28-30]. 9. Conclusion Hybrid catalysts containing supported Zn or Ga species led to more active, selective and stable cata- lysts than the parent ZSM-5 zeolite. The examination of the distribution of the bulky aromatic products in the reactor outstream, and of the nature of the coke left in the zeolite pores gave the following results: Parent zeolite. (i) Lower aromatic production, (ii) lower catalyst on-stream stability, and (iii) 'heavy' coke formation. Hybrid catalysts. (i) Much higher aromatic pro- duction, (ii) much higher catalyst on-stream sta- bility, and (iii) 'light' coke formation. In particular with n-butane feed, it appears that the catalyst stability depends on the nature and not on the amount of coke produced since both catalyst config- R. Le Van Mao et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 164 (1997) 81-89 89 urations produce almost equal amounts of coke. According to Guisnet and Gnep [7], gallium had practically no effect on the coke composition. There- fore, in our case (parent zeolite versus Ga containing hybrid catalyst), the significant difference in the coke composition could be attributed to the physical pre- sence of the co-catalyst in accordance with the spil- lover hypothesis [ 15,27].

In the aromatization of light hydrocarbons, hybrid catalysts containing Zn or Ga supported co-catalysts showed much better performance and on-stream stability than the parent ZSM-5 zeolite. This was attributed to the beneficial effect of the co-catalyst on the nature of the coke formed in the zeolite particles. In fact, with both Zn and Ga hybrid catalyst systems, it was observed that the coke species formed were ‘light’ coke having a paraffinic nature, in contrast with the more aromatic ‘heavy’ coke produced by the parent zeolite. Particularly with n-butane feed, it was the nature of the coke formed which determined the activity and stability of the catalyst since both catalysts produced nearly equal amounts of coke under the same reaction conditions. As a general result of this study, the lighter the coke formed, the more aromatic the product stream and the higher the on-stream catalyst stability.
