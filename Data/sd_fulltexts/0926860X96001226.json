Taedok Science Town, Taejon 305-343, South Korea Received 18 October 1995: revised 11 March 1996; accepted 15 March 1996 Abstract The effect of nickel concentration and sulfiding temperature on the type and distribution of the surface species and on the dispersion in a series of alumina-supported Ni-W hydrodesulfurization (HDS) catalysts were investigated by temperature programmed reduction (TPR), diffuse re- flectance spectroscopy (DRS), dynamic 02 and NO chemisorption (DOC, DNOC), X-ray photo- electron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), sulfur content analysis and thiophene HDS reaction. In the thiophene HDS reaction, the Ni-W/~-AI203 system showed a strong synergistic behavior. The maximum activity was achieved at about Ni/(Ni + W)= 0.6. When sulfiding temperature increased from 673 K to 1073 K, the activity monotonously decreased with the S-shaped curve. TPR results revealed three different nickel species, a highly dispersed NiO surface species, a mixed Ni-W oxide phase, and a subsurface NiAl204-1ike phase. The nature and the amount of these species depended on nickel loading. DRS results provided complementary support for the presence of these species. The results of XRD, sulfur content analysis. DOC. DNOC, and XPS indicated that the sulfidability and the crystallinity of WS2 increased with the increase in sulfidation temperature. The surface nickel species diffused into the bulk at high sulfidation temperature.

Kim et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 159-175 1. Introduction Co- and Ni-promoted molybdenum and tungsten catalysts supported on alumina are widely used for hydrotreating various petroleum fractions. Cobalt- promoted catalysts are mainly used for hydrodesulfurization (HDS), whereas nickel-promoted catalysts are superior in hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) and hydrogenation (HYD) reactions. Ni-W catalysts have not been used so fre- quently as Co-Mo and Ni-Mo catalysts because of high cost and difficulty in sulfiding [1]. For alumina-supported Mo- and W-based oxide precursors, the species present at low loading are isolated tetrahedral M0042- and WO2- units. At higher loadings polymolybdate and polytungstate species are formed. At further higher loadings bulk MoO3 and WO3 are present [2-4]. In contrast to the formation of A12(MoO4)3 at moderate calcination temperature, A12(WO4)3 are formed at a calcination temperature higher than 1273 K [5,6]. Other differences in Mo- and W-based catalysts are found in the sulfidability and reducibility of oxide precursors. It was reported that the sulfidability and the reducibility of various chemical species on the Ni-W and Co-Mo catalysts are remarkably different [7-9]. The structure and the distribution of the promoter species formed after calcining at high temperatures was different from each other [7,8]. Even though the sulfidation mechanism of Mo- and W-based catalysts are identical [10,11], W catalysts supported on alumina cannot be sulfided com- pletely and Mo catalysts supported on alumina are practically able to be sulfided completely at 673 K [12,13]. The addition of nickel promoter to the W catalyst increased the sulfidability of oxidic W species. However, still considerable amounts of oxidic tungsten species are present after normal sulfidation [12,14]. It is much more difficult to reduce the Ni-W system [7]. Duchet et al. also showed that W/A1203 chemisorbs less CO and 02 than Mo/A1203 [13]. These peculiar characteristics of W-based catalysts mentioned above prompted us to study the effect of nickel loading and sulfidation temperature on the reducibility and sulfidability of oxidic tungsten species and the catalytic activity in the thiophene HDS reaction. Therefore, we prepared catalysts of various Ni/(Ni + W) atomic ratios at the tungsten coverage which is slightly larger than the monolayer. Characterization of prepared catalysts was performed with TPR, dynamic 02 and NO chemisorption, DRS, XRD, and XPS. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation The WO3/AI203 catalyst was prepared by the incipient wetness method. \"y-Alumina support (JRC-ALO-4, surface area 152 m2/g, pore volume 0.67 cm3/g) was crushed and sieved to 50/100 mesh, impregnated with an aqueous C.-H.

The NiO/AI203 catalyst was prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation with an aqueous solution of nickel nitrate, followed by drying and calcining similar to the preparation of the WO3/AI:O3 catalyst. NiO-WO3/AI203 catalysts were prepared by the impregnation of aqueous nickel nitrate solution onto WO3/AIRO3. Drying and calcination was performed at 393 K and 813 K, respectively. Catalysts will be denoted by capital letters N and W which means nickel and tungsten, respectively, followed by x and y, the integer number of metal atoms per nm2 of alumina, namely, NxWy. For example, N3W4 contains 2.9 atoms/nm2 NiO and 4.4 atoms/nm2 WO3. Prepared catalysts are listed in Table 1. 2.2. Determination of catalytic activity The catalytic activities of prepared catalysts for thiophene HDS reaction were measured in a tubular microreactor at 1 atm. Catalysts (100 mg and 50/100 mesh) were presulfided. The temperature was raised from room temperature to the desired sulfiding temperature (673 K, if not mentioned otherwise) in a flow of 60 cmB/min of N2 for 1 h. Then the gas was changed to the mixture of 10 vol.-% of H2S in H2 at 40 cmB/min. Sulfidation was proceeded for 3 h. Hereafter the flow of HzS/H2 was replaced by a flow of 60 cm3/min of N2. And then the temperature was adjusted to the reaction temperature, 673 K, in 1 h. Then N2 purging gas was replaced by a reaction mixture containing H2 (Dongjin, purity > 99.9999%) and thiophene (Aldrich, 99 + %). Thiophene was fed to the reactor with a syringe pump at a molar flow rate of 1.2217. 1()-6 mol/s. The mole ratio of H2 to thiophene was 18. Reaction products were analyzed using on-line gas chromatography equipped with a thermal conductiv- ity detector and a stainless steel column (5'1/8\" O.D.) filled with 1.5% OV-101 on 100/120 Chromosorb G. From the thiophene conversion, a rate constant k~ was calculated by assuming first-order kinetics with respect to 162 C.-H. Kim et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 159-175 thiophene. After 2 h of reaction, the steady state was obtained and k~ was calculated at the reaction temperature of 673 K. 2.3. Characterization 2.3.1. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) The apparatus consisted of a quartz-glass U-tube reactor, a water trap (aceton-dry ice bath), and a thermal conductivity detector to monitor the hydrogen concentration of the carrier gas (5 vol.-% H2 in N2). The oxidic catalyst sample containing 5.10-5 tool WO3 was placed in the reactor and temperature was raised from room temperature up to 773 K for 1 h in a flow of oxygen and kept at 773 K for 1 h. Then it was cooled down to room temperature. Reducing gas of 5 vol.-% H2/N2 was passed through catalyst bed at a flow rate of 30 cm3/min. Then the temperature of the sample was increased from room temperature up to 1223 K at a rate of 5 K/rain. Subsequently the sample was kept at 1223 K for ca. 30 min. 2.3.2. Dynamic 0e and NO chemisorption (DOC, DNOC) Dynamic oxygen and NO chemisorption uptakes for the sulfided samples were measured in the apparatus equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a six-port valve by which the probe molecules were introduced. Samples were presulfided in the same way as the HDS reaction except that the purging gas was helium. The sample was cooled down to room temperature. Oxygen and NO pulses of known volume were introduced by a six-port valve until the integrated peak area of effluent gas became constant within 1%. 2.3.3. UV-VIS diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) DRS measurements were carried out with a Shimatzu UV-3100S spectrome- ter equipped with a MPC-3100 diffuse reflectance accessory. Spectra were recorded from 750 to 240 rim. In order to measure the reflection quantitatively and reproducibly, the sample was contained in a specially constructed cell with quartz windows spaced ca. 3 mm apart. BaSO4 was used as a standard reference. The value of the Schuster-Kubelka-Munk (SKM) remission function was determined. Catalyst particles used in this work are much larger than ca. 10 10-6 m and the SKM values of different samples can be compared directly. 2.3.4. X-ray diffraction (XRD) XRD patterns were recorded on a diffractometer (Rigaku Co.) equipped with CuKeL radiation. The XRD spectra of calcined catalysts and sulfided catalysts were recorded ex situ at room temperature. 2.3.5. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) XPS measurements were carried out with a Leybold LHS-10 spectrometer equipped with an aluminum anode (hv = 1486.6 eV) operated at 30 mA and 10 C.-H. Kim et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 159-175 163 kV. The residual pressure inside the spectrometer was about 10-9 Ton\" (760 Torr = 1.013 105 Pa). After the sample was sulfided in the quartz-glass U-tube reactor equipped with vacuum stopcock, it was transferred to a nitrogen-glove box. Catalyst samples were attached on double-sided adhesive tape which was mounted on tantalum foil in N2 atmosphere to avoid the surface oxidation of the sulfided sample and introduced to the spectrometer without contacting air. The AI 2p peak (74.8 eV) was used as a reference. The surface atomic composition of each element was obtained from the integrated peak areas of each element divided by the XPS atomic sensitivity factor [15]. 2.3.6. Sulfur content analysis Total sulfur content of sulfided catalysts was determined by the combustion of sulfided catalyst at 1423 K in an He-O2 flow. Produced SO2 was detected by ND-IR-SO2-photometer according to ASTM D-4239 method. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Effect of nickel loading on the physicochemical properties of Ni- W catalysts 3.1.1. BET surface area and XRD The surface area of alumina was 152 m2/g. The surface area of N4 was 142.1 mZ/g indicating that significant pore-plugging due to NiO was not observed. However, the surface area of W4 decreased significantly due to the high loading of WO3 (20.5 wt.-%) indicating the presence of pore plugging. The addition of Ni on W4 did not change the surface area much as shown in Table 1. All catalysts showed a XRD pattern similar to that of \",/-alumina, indicating that large oxide particles are not present. 3.1.2. Sulfur content analysis Sulfur content analyses for samples sulfided at 673 K were conducted. As shown in Table 2, the degree of sulfidation was much lower than that of Mo-based catalysts [16]. A slight increase in the degree of sulfidation was observed as the nickel loading was increased. 3.1.3. Catalytic activities Rate constants (k~) in thiophene HDS are shown in Table 2 and kj are plotted as a function of the nickel loading as shown in Fig. 1. The kI of N7W4 catalyst was about 15 times larger than that of the W4 catalyst. Gachet et al. reported that nickel showed a strong promotional effect on the HDS activity [17]. This phenomenon is largely attributed to the very low activity of W4 catalyst in comparison with the alumina-supported Mo catalyst. As shown in Fig. 1, a very steep increase in activity was observed at the Ni/(Ni + W) atomic 164 C.-H.

It increased slowly up to the atomic ratio of 0.6 followed by a slight decrease between the ratios of 0.6 and 0.7. Similar behavior is reported by Kural et al. [18]. Until the atomic ratio of 0.2 was reached, a phase responsible for high activity was mainly formed. Further increase in nickel loading leads to the formation of the relatively less-active surface species. Finally, the decrease in activity is attributed either to the blocking of some active species by Ni species or to the decrease in the relative amount of tungsten, so-called, the 'second support' [19].

Kim et al, /Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 159-175 165 constants that can be defined as k~/(mole of W/kgc,~) as shown in the parentheses of Fig. 1 did not change much with the addition of Ni species, indicating that the further addition of Ni did not contribute to form active species. 3.1.4. Dynamic 02 and NO chemisorption (DOC and DNOC) DOC and DNOC results are listed in Table 2. The amount of O2 uptake of W4 was very low compared to that of the Mo-based catalyst [16]. It can be related to the low sulfidability of the W-based catalyst, i.e., small amounts of dichalcogenide, WS2. The amount of 02 uptake increased with increase in the nickel content. Although it is believed that oxygen is adsorbed on the anion vacancy of the WS2 slab, O2 was mainly chemisorbed on the nickel species. Even though the amount of DOC uptake of N4 is higher than N7W4, the rate constant of N4 is one-tenth of that of N7W4. Considering the good linear correlation of the sulfided monometallic tungsten or nickel catalysts with the DOC uptakes [20,21], the inability for the sulfided Ni-W system to correlate the DOC uptake with activity seems to be arising from the formation of highly active synergistic Ni-W-S species. Previous studies about DOC on the pro- moted Mo-based catalysts [22] can also be understood similarly. Hence, it can be concluded that DOC cannot be used successfully to measure the dispersion of the active species of the Ni-W catalyst. However, DOC uptake can be used as a measure of surface nickel content. DNOC also showed a similar behavior with respect to nickel. 3.1.5. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) TPR experiments of oxidic precursor were conducted to study the oxide species of Ni-W catalysts of different Ni loading. TPR spectra of W4 shows two peaks at 903 K and 993 K (Fig. 2(a)). These peaks can be assigned to a bulk WO3 formed in the case of exceeding monolayer coverage [23]. It was reported that the monolayer coverage of WO3 supported on alumina prepared by incipient wetness method is between 4.0 [6,20] and 4.3 [3] atoms W/nm2. Because W4 contains 4.4 atoms W/nm2, WO3 particles could be formed during calcination. The steady increase in the base line is attributed to the reduction of dispersed W species of various reducibilities. The reduction of the dispersed W species proceeded even above 1223 K [7]. N1W4 shows three new peaks superimposed on the TPR spectra of W4 (Fig. 3(b)). The first peak at 883 K was very small, whereas the second peak at 1073 K was large. The third peak at 1103 K shown as a weak shoulder developed as the Ni content increased as shown in Fig. 2. From the extensive work by Scheffer et al. [7], these three peaks can be assigned to a highly dispersed NiO surface species, a mixed NiO-WO3 phase associated with HDS activity, and diluted NiAI204 spinel-like phase, respectively. The decrease in H2 consumption of N1W4 at 1223 K compared to W4 was observed. This can be attributed to the fact that dispersed C.-H.

TPR patterns of various oxidic NxWy catalysts: (a) W4, (b) NIW4, (c) N3W4, (d) N4W4, (e) N7W4, (f) N10W4, and (g) N4. All samples contained 50 ixmol WO3 except for N4 which contained 100 p~mol NiO. W species is incorporated with Ni species to form a NiO-WO3 mixed oxide phase. Hence, W species in the NiO-WO3 mixed oxide phase was reduced at 1073 K resulting in the new TPR peak of N1W4. From the fact that the peaks of bulk WO3 did not change, it seems that bulk WO3 did not contribute to the formation of NiO-WO3 mixed oxide phase. As shown in Fig. 1, the k~ of N1W4 is 11.5 times larger than that of W4, which can be explained by the newly formed NiO-WO3 mixed oxide phase. It can be concluded that the strong synergistic effect on HDS activity was originated from the NiO-WO3 mixed oxide phase. The TPR spectra of NxW4 having the Ni/(Ni + W) atomic ratio between 0.2 and 0.7 were magnified in Fig. 4. As the nickel loading increased, the reducibility of the NiO-WO3 mixed phase was enhanced up to the atomic ratio of 0.4 indicated by the decrease in the reduction temperature from 1073 K to 1045 K. The intensity of the TPR peak arising from the NiO-WO3 mixed phase was increased. This increase is not due to the increase in the amount of NiO-WO3 mixed oxide phase but to the overlap with the TPR peak arising from the reduction of NiA1204-1ike species at 1103 K. The catalytic activity did not increase much between the Ni/(Ni + W) ratio of 0.2 and 0.7 as shown in Fig. 1. This can be explained by the further formation of the small amount of NiO-WO3 mixed oxide phase and by the formation of NiA1204 spinel-like phase and NiO phase indicated by the TPR peak at 883 K with further addition C.-H, Kim et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 159-175 16-/ I --1 o o,.

Because the NiA1204 phase and NiO phase are inactive species, the catalytic activity cannot increase much. The intensity of the TPR peak at 883 K arising from the highly dispersed NiO surface species increased significantly when the atomic ratio of Ni/(Ni + W) increased from 0.2 to 0.4, while the intensity did not change much when the atomic ratio of Ni/(Ni + W) increased from 0.4 to 0.6. For N10W7, a strong TPR peak was observed at 860 K which is much lower than the TPR peaks of N3W4, N4W4 and N7W4 appearing at 883 K. This shift to lower temperature is arising from the larger NiO clusters which interact less with the alumina surface. 3.1.6. UV-VIS diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) UV-VIS DRS analysis of the oxidic precursor was performed to study the coordination of nickel species. It is known that the nickel in dilute NiAI204 spinel-like species has a tetrahedral and octahedral coordination, whereas NiO and NiWO4 species have only an octahedral coordination [24]. The peak at 720 nm is attributed to the nickel ions having octahedral coordination, and the peak at 635 nm is attributed to the nickel ions having a tetrahedral coordination as shown in Fig. 5.

As the Ni/(Ni + W) atomic ratio increased, the proportion of the tetrahedrally coordinated species reached maximum up to the atomic ratio of 0.6, then decreased. At the Ni/(Ni + W) atomic ratio of 0.6, the tetrahedral holes of alumina were occupied by the nickel cation. Additional nickel was converted to a nickel oxide species having octahedral coordination less interacting with the surface of alumina, in agreement with the TPR result. 3.2. Effect of sulfiding temperature on the structure and catalytic properties 3.2.1. BET surface area and XRD Surface area of W4 and N4W4 did not change after sulfiding between 673 K and 1073 K. XRD patterns of W4 and N4W4 catalyst sulfided at 673, 873, and 1073 K are shown in Fig. 7. For W4 catalyst sulfided at 673 K, only the characteristic diffraction peaks arising from the alumina were found. As the sulfiding temperature raised to 873 K, a strong peak appeared around 20 = 33.5 which can be assigned to the (101) plane of the crystalline WS2 [20,25]. At 1073 K, the XRD peak arising from the (002) plane of the crystalline WS2 appeared C,-H.

The variations in the XRD patterns of N4W4 catalyst due to the increase in the sulfiding temperature are very similar to that of W4. However, the intensity of the XRD pattern at 20 = 14.3of N4W4 sulfided at 1073 K was stronger than those of W4 sulfided at 1073 K as shown in Fig. 7c and f. This is not the case for the Co-Mo system [ 16], where the existence of cobalt inhibited the formation of crystalline MoS2. 3.2.2. Catalytic activity The rate constants k1 of the N4W4 catalyst sulfided at various temperatures for the thiophene HDS reaction are listed in Table 3. Maximum activity was Table 3 First-order rate constants (k i), DOC and DNOC uptakes of N4W4 sulfided at various temperatures Sulfiding temperature k] ~ DOC uptake DNOC uptake (K) (10-3 m3 kg~-al s I) (10-6 tool O2/g) (10-6 tool NO/g) 673 5.33 40.11 107.22 773 4.41 30.67 97.02 873 1.87 19.36 76.34 1073 0.97 19.83 74.36 a Determined at the reaction temperature of 673 K. C.-H. Kim et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 159-175 171 obtained after sulfiding at 673 K. When N4W4 was sulfided at 1073 K, the order of magnitude of the activity drops to the level of the monometallic catalyst. This decrease in the activity can be explained by the sintering of the WS2 crystallite slabs and the destruction of the synergistic Ni-W sulfide phase. The fact that the intensity of the XRD peak of WS2 increased and that the band width of WS2 peak decreased indicated the growth of a WS2 polycrystalline slab. It is thought that the sintering of WS2 crystallites leads to the decrease in the edge site or anion vacancy which serves as a 'second support' [19] for the formation of a Ni-W synergistic species. Therefore, excess nickel species can be either aggregated to form a nickel sulfide cluster or converted to other inactive species. 3.2.3. DOC and DNOC The results of DOC and DNOC uptakes for the N4W4 at various suifding temperatures are given in Table 3. As the sulfidation temperature increased DOC and DNOC uptakes decreased. However, the extent of decrease is much less than that of decrease in the activity. As shown in XRD results, below the sulfidation temperature of 873 K, there is no formation of large WS2 clusters. However, there might be a small degree of sintering of the Ni-W sulfide cluster indicated by the small decrease in the activity, indicating that the synergistic phase was not destroyed significantly below 873 K. As the sulfidation tempera- ture increased from 773 K to 873 K, the activity decreased by 60%, while DOC and DNOC uptakes decreased by 37 and 21%, respectively, indicating the signifcant destruction of the Ni-W-S synergistic phase. At the sulfidation of 1073 K, the catalytic activity decreased extensively, while DOC and DNOC uptakes did not change much, suggesting the extensive decomposition of the synergistic phase to WS2 or NiS which can still chemisorb 02 and NO extensively. 3.2.4. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) To obtain further information about the chemical state, surface composition, and dispersion, XPS measurements were carried out for N4W4 sulfided at 673, 873, and 1073 K. The W 4f spectra of N4W4 at various sulfiding temperatures are shown in Fig. 8. When the catalyst was sulfided at 673 K (Fig. 8a), The W 4f7/2.5/2 doublet peaks at 36.0 and 38.1 eV can be assigned to the WO3, and doublet peaks at 32.3 and 34.8 eV can be assigned to the sulfidic tungsten in WS~-like structure [3]. The catalyst sulfided at 673 K has more oxidic phase than sulfidic phase. This result is in agreement with the sulfur content analysis of NxW4. As the sulfiding temperature increased, the intensity of the peaks corresponding to the oxidic W state decreased rapidly and that of the peaks arising from sulfidic phase increased. The binding energies attributed to the sulfidic W state were shifted to lower values. This can be attributed to the fact that the binding energy approached to the value of bulk WS, as the environment 172 C.-H.

W 4f XPS spectra of the N4W4 catalyst as a function of the sulfiding temperature: sample sulfided at (a) 673 K, (b) 873 K, and (c) 1073 K. of the W ion became similar to that of WS2 crystallites by the increase in sulfidability. To obtain information about the dispersion of surface species, the surface atomic composition ratios of S 2p, W 4f, and Ni 2p3/2 against Al 2p are illustrated in Fig. 9. The ratio of W 4f/Al 2p decreased linearly with the increase in sulfiding temperature. In accordance with the previous results, WS2 crystallites sinter and agglomerate at high sulfiding temperature. The ratio of Ni 2p/A1 2p decreased drastically with increase in sulfiding temperature. As discussed in DOC and DNOC uptake results, this decrease in dispersion of surface nickel species could be caused by the diffusion of nickel ion into the alumina support. This can also be partially supported by the fact that no XRD peak due to the nickel sulfide could be detected. The ratio of S 2p/A1 2p also decreased relatively slowly with the increase in the sulfiding temperature, which can be explained by the sintering of sulfide phase in spite of increase in sulfur content. The ratio of S 2p/(Ni 2p3/2 + W 4f) increased steadily as shown in Fig. 9. This is arising from the migration of both nickel and tungsten into bulk. In the mean time, the degree of sulfidiaton of surface nickel and tungsten species increased with the sulfiding temperature. This change in structure of alumina-supported Ni-W catalyst induced by the increase in sulfiding tempera- ture is different from that of alumina-supported Co-Mo catalyst system. Kim et al. [16] reported that cobalt sulfide was formed when sulfided at 1073 K in an C. - H.

This means that cobalt species in an alumina-supported Co-Mo catalyst aggregate to form cobalt sulfide on the surface at the sulfiding temperature of 1073 K. On the other hand, the surface nickel species diffuses into the tetrahedral hole of the alumina to form dilute NiA1204 spinel-like species, thereby a large portion of nickel can no longer play the role of promoter. Sulfiding at high temperatures accelerates the destruction of the synergistic Ni-W mixed phase. Therefore, the synergistic Ni-W phase is more thermally fragile than the synergistic Co-Mo phase. 4. Conclusion The alumina-supported Ni-W catalyst was evaluated for the hydrodesulfur- ization of thiophene. The activities of the catalysts were changed depending on the nickel concentration and the sulfiding temperature. The optimum catalytic activity was obtained at the Ni/(Ni + W) atomic ratio of 0.6 and at the sulfiding temperature of 673 K. The structural characteristics of this catalyst system caused by the change in promoter nickel concentration and sulfiding temperature were elucidated and compared with the catalytic activity. As the nickel loading increased step by step 174 C.-H. Kim et aL /Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 159-175 with the Ni/(Ni + W) atomic ratio from 0 to 0.7, a logarithmic increase in activity for thiophene HDS was observed. The initial synergistic increase in activity was attributed to the formation of the mixed Ni-W phase, while additional nickel loading mainly led to the formation of inactive dispersed NiO surface species and the subsurface NiA1204 spinel-like phase. As the sulfiding temperature increased gradually from 673 K to 1073 K, the activity was monotonously decreased with the S-shaped curve. This result can be explained by the sintering of the WS2 crystallite slabs and by the diffusion of the surface nickel species into the alumina support.

In the thiophene HDS reaction, the NiW/γ-Al2O3 system showed a strong synergistic behavior. The maximum activity was achieved at about Ni/(Ni + W)= 0.6. When sulfiding temperature increased from 673 K to 1073 K, the activity monotonously decreased with the S-shaped curve. TPR results revealed three different nickel species, a highly dispersed NiO surface species, a mixed NiW oxide phase, and a subsurface NiAl2O4-like phase. The nature and the amount of these species depended on nickel loading. DRS results provided complementary support for the presence of these species. The results of XRD, sulfur content analysis, DOC, DNOC, and XPS indicated that the sulfidability and the crystallinity of WS2 increased with the increase in sulfidation temperature.
