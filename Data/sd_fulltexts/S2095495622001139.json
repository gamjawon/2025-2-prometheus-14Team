Graphical Abstract A free-standing electrode with hierarchical 3D structure by coupling La doped NiFe-LDH nanosheets onto vertically aligned MXene nanosheets on macroporous NF wasdeveloped for highly efficient overall water splitting. The development of stable electrocatalysts with high hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) activity in alkaline electrolytes is critical to renewable energy conversion technologies, such as electrochemical water splitting. In this work, a novel strategy for engineering water splitting electrocatalysts in alkaline electrolyte was developed by synergistically coupling La-doped NiFe-layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDH) nanosheets onto three-dimensional (3D) vertically aligned MXene nanosheets on macroporous nickel foam (NF) substrates (NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF). The electrocatalytic performance of the prepared NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF is enhanced by the synergy of strong electronic interaction among multiple metal centers and unique vertically aligned porous MXene with increased active surface area, accelerated reaction kinetics and improved water adsorption and dissociation ability. To reach the commercially required current density (500 mA cm−2), the NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF exhibits greatly reduced overpotentials of 233 and 255 mV for HER and OER, respectively, along with excellent durability. Moreover, an alkaline electrolyzer driven by NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF delivers a lower cell voltage (1.71 V) compared with that of Pt/C-RuO2 couple to achieve the current density of 500 mA cm−2. Keywords Bifunctional electrocatalyst MXene Layered double hydroxide Lanthanum Overall water splitting 1 Introduction Electrochemical water splitting holds great promise in making full use of renewable energy sources by converting them into chemical energy, hydrogen, which is a sustainable and clean energy carrier with high energy density [1–4]. However, both of the half reactions in water splitting process: hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) suffer from sluggish reaction kinetics for multistep proton coupled electron transfer process [5–7]. Owing to the unsatisfactory stability of the metal catalyst, high cost of proton exchange membranes and the sluggish kinetics of OER in acidic media, alkaline water splitting electrolyzers are more valuable for widespread applications [8]. Nevertheless, in an alkaline medium, the HER kinetics is severely reduced by the Volmer step, in which water molecules adsorb on the electrode surface and dissociate into adsorbed hydrogen atoms (H2O + e− → H* + OH−) [9]. Developing bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting with improved water adsorption/dissociation ability can efficiently lower the thermodynamic overpotential and thus reduce the energy consumption [10–12]. Electrocatalysts based on noble metals such as Pt and RuO2/IrO2 are considered as efficient HER and OER catalysts. However, besides the unaffordable cost and inferior durability, their widespread utilization is still limited to the single catalytic action for water splitting [13–15]. Driven by these challenges, numerous efficient earth-abundant transition metal based catalysts for alkaline HER have been well investigated in recent years, while their OER performance are still unsatisfactory [16–18]. Moreover, some excellent OER electrocatalysts in alkaline media such as Fe–Co–Ni-layered double hydroxides (Fe–Co–Ni LDHs) are mostly inactive for HER [19–21]. Therefore, exploring efficient and robust non-precious metal electrocatalysts for both HER and OER is still a great challenge. NiFe-LDHs are considered as promising alternatives to noble metal catalysts in alkaline media due to their earth abundance and impressive electrochemical activity [22–24]. Nevertheless, despite the outstanding OER activity of NiFe-LDHs benefited from the favorable kinetics in unique layered structure and strong synergistic interaction among the Ni and Fe metal centers, its HER activity is usually poor in alkaline electrolyzers [25–27]. Meanwhile, the low surface area caused by aggregation and poor conductivity of NiFe-LDH still leads to a high water splitting voltage [28,29]. To further improve the efficiency of the NiFe-LDH catalysts, several effective strategies have been proposed, including optimizing nanostructures to increase the active sites, coupling with conductive substrates to enhance the charge transference and constructing hybridization architecture to modify electronic structure and optimize the binding energies between the catalyst and reactant [30–32]. For instance, Zhang et al. reported a heterostructure of coupling NiFe-LDH nanosheets on NiCoP with interface engineering and synergistic effects, which partially enhance the electrocatalytic activity and stability [32]. Chen et al. partially substituted Fe centers of NiFe-LDHs with Ru dopants and thus successfully accelerated the Volmer step of alkaline HER kinetics, which eventually enhanced the water splitting efficiency [33]. Above study confirmed that coupling NiFe-LDH with other species to optimize its electronic structure is effective for improving its HER activity, while there is little report on the introduction of rare earth metals with special 4f orbitals into NiFe-LDH. Since the advent of the MXenes in 2011, they have attracted interdisciplinary attention and research in vast fields owing to their fascinating properties, such as layered structure, metallic conductivity, excellent hydrophily, rich surface chemistry and small band gaps [34–38]. MXenes have a general formula of M n+1X n T x , where M stands for an early transition metal; X is C and/or N, T is the surface groups [39,40]. MXenes can serve as excellent substrates for multicomponent catalysts owing to their wide chemical variety, high conductivity and rich surface chemistry [41–44]. However, due to the interlayer coupling in two-dimensional nanomaterials, the irreversible restacking and aggregation can always occur during the conventional electrode fabrication-methods, which seriously limits the utilization of the MXene surface and ion transport in plane-to-plane stacked MXene films. To impede the aggregation of MXene sheets and facilitate ion transport of films, significant attempts have been made to integrate 2D materials into three-dimensional (3D) macroscopic structures [45–47]. For example, Gogotsi and co-workers developed a template-engaged strategy to fabricate a 3D macroporous MXene electrode [48]. This structure effectively inhibits the restacking of MXene and further increases electrochemical active sites and ion accessibility. After that, Yang group and Gogotsi group vertically align MXene nanosheets on substrates through mechanical shearing of a discotic lamellar liquid–crystal phase of Ti3C2T x [46]. These electrodes exhibited ultrafast charging capabilities than horizontally stacked MXene films. Nevertheless, constructing 3D MXene porous architecture and coupling it with other active species is still challenging. Therefore, an innovative and efficient strategy was developed herein to construct stable 3D MXene structure and couple it with La-doped NiFe-LDH. Benefitting from the synergistic effect of the La dopant and unique structure, the electrocatalytic performance of both the half-reactions for water splitting can be remarkably enhanced, especially for HER. In this work, a bifunctional hierarchically structured electrode was designed by coupling La doped NiFe-LDH nanosheets onto 3D vertically aligned MXene nanosheets on nickel foam substrates (denoted as NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF). This 3D vertically aligned MXene nanosheets electrode with porous structure and large exposed specific surface, enabling directional ion transport and fast gas release. The incorporation of highly abundant La dopants with unique empty 4f orbitals in NiFeLa-LDH may alter the topology of the layer and generate the strong electron interactions within the metal center, therefore accelerate the HER and OER process. The 3D MXene with high conductivity and hydrophilicity can greatly promote the charge transference and the adsorption/activation of the reactants to NiFeLa-LDHs in solution, thereby boosting the HER/OER activity of NiFeLa-LDHs. NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF can directly serve as the free-standing electrode with low overpotentials for both HER and OER. Only a considerably low cell voltage of 1.71 V is needed to achieve the current densities of 500 mA cm−2 when NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF electrodes drive an electrolyzer as both the anode and cathode. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF The Ti3C2 MXene was synthesized through a previously reported method [9]. The v-MXene/NF was prepared by the electrophoretic deposition. Firstly, 16 μL HCl (6 M) aqueous solution was added into 20 mL aqueous suspension of Ti3C2 MXene (2 mg mL−1) to adjust pH value of the MXene dispersion to 3, and the mixture was sonicated to form a stable MXene colloid. Subsequently, the electrophoretic deposition process was carried out using two pieces of nickel foam (1 × 3 cm2) as electrodes and prepared MXene colloid as electrolyte. The two electrodes were immersed 2 cm into the electrolyte, between which a constant voltage of 20 V was applied for 15 s. The positive electrode was used as v-MXene/NF after freeze-drying for 12 h. The MXene/NF was prepared by directly immersing NF into the MXene colloid for 10 min and dried at 60 °C. NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF was synthesized through electrodeposition, in which the obtained v-MXene/NF, Pt foil and Ag/AgCl electrode served as the working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The electrolyte is a mixture of 12 M Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and La(NO3)3·6H2O with a molar ratio of 1: 0.5: 0.5. A potential of −1.0 V was applied in potentiostatic deposition process for 300 s. By adjusting the deposition time and the ratio of Ni, Fe and La in the electrolyte, various electrodes were produced. NiFeLa-LDH/MXene/NF and NiFeLa-LDH/NF were also synthesized in a similar way using MXene/NF and pristine NF as working electrodes. The mass loading of NiFeLa-LDH is ca. 3.85 mg cm−2 and the measuring method is provided in Supporting Information . 2.2 Material characterization The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the products were characterized by a D/Max-III spectrometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra were obtained on a Nicolet-20DXB spectrometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was collected by a Thermo ESCALAB MK II. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP) was taken on Optima 2000DV. A SL200B instrument was used to investigate the surface wettability of the electrodes. The electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) tests were proceeded on QCM 200 Quartz Crystal Microbalance. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) images were obtained on FEI NanoSEM 450. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images and corresponding elemental mappings were performed on a FEI TF30. 2.3 Electrochemical measurements The electrocatalytic performance was examined using a three-electrode system in 1.0 M KOH on a CHI 760D workstation. The working electrode was then obtained NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF. Ag/AgCl and graphite electrode served as the reference and counter electrode, respectively. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) tests for HER or OER were carried out in Ar or O2 saturated electrolytes at 10 mV s−1 with 90% iR compensation. Overall water splitting measurements were carried out using NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF as both of the anode and cathode. For comparison, electrolyzer with a NF-supported RuO2 (RuO2/NF) cathode and a NF-supported Pt/C (Pt/C/NF) anode was also tested according to the same procedure. The detailed synthetic process of these two electrodes is available in Supporting Information . The LSVs were recorded at 10 mV s−1. The quantity of produced H2 was measured by gas chromatography (GC). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Morphological and structural characterization NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF was fabricated by a two-step route (Fig. 1 a). Ti3C2 MXene nanosheets were obtained by selectively etching Al layers in Ti3AlC2. Fig. S1 shows a TEM image of Ti3C2. MXene then tightly grow on the surface of macroporous NF scaffold through the electrophoretic deposition processed in a stable colloid suspension, as shown in Fig. S2. Through the following freeze-drying method, vertically aligned MXene with a robust porous structure was achieved (denoted as v-MXene/NF). The color of the electrode apparently changed from silver to black during this process, as shown in Fig. S3. It can be observed through a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) that v-MXene/NF exhibits an obvious 3D porous structure with MXene layers stand on the whole macroporous scaffold of NF examination (Fig. S4). This feature creates highly open channels from the electrode surface to the substrate, which enable ions to transport directionally. In the MXene/NF electrode, however, plane-to-plane stacking MXene films tightly wrap around the scaffold of NF because of the interlayer coupling, leading to a reduced utilization of the porous structure and the reduced exposure of MXene films, as shown in Fig. S5 and S6. The La-doped NiFe-LDH nanosheets (NiFeLa-LDH) with the lateral sizes of 40–70 nm and the thickness of about 5 nm can be further grown on v-MXene/NF frame through the electrodeposition process via the reaction (xNi2+ + yFe3+ + zLa3+ (2x + 3y + 3z)OH− → Ni x Fe y La z OH2x+3y+3z ) (Fig. 1b–e). Panoramic SEM views reveal that the NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF maintains the 3D porous structure of v-MXene/NF without collapse (Fig. S7) and the elemental mapping analysis (Fig. 1f) clarifies the uniform distribution of C, Ti, O, Ni, Fe and La elements. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern shown in Fig. S8 further confirm the amorphous nature of NiFeLa-LDH. The electrodeposition process was optimized by adjusting the deposition time and the molar ratio of metal elements in the electrolyte (Fig. S9). The sample obtained at −1.0 V for 300 s exhibited the highest activity for both HER and OER. A shorter electrodeposition time results in less amount of active NiFeLa-LDHs, while a longer time leads to poor conductive thick films. Fig. S9(d and h) demonstrate that the optimal molar ratio of Ni, Fe and La precursors is 1: 0.5: 0.5, which results in a nanohybrid with Ni, Fe and La atomic ratio of ca. 1: 0.57: 0.91. As the content of La constituent increases, the size of LDHs nanosheets gets shorter and thicker (Fig. S10). The doping of La3+ (103.2 pm) with larger ionic radius compared with Ni2+ (69 pm) and Fe3+ (64.5 pm) could distorting the lattice, reducing crystallite size, generating surface defects and increasing the mobility of electrons [49,50]. In the XRD pattern of NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene (Fig. 2 a), peaks of NF appear at 44.9° and 52.3°, and peaks at 6.5° and 61.2° correspond to the (002) and (110) planes of MXene. In addition, the NiFeLa-LDH nanosheets deposited on v-MXene/NF are amorphous in nature since there is no diffraction peaks of NiFeLa-LDH, which is favorable to provide extra defect sites for accelerating electrocatalysis [51–54]. La, Ni, Fe, O, Ti and C elements can be identified in the survey XPS spectrum of NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene (Fig. 2b). The Ti 2p spectrum can be divided into three pairs doublets at 455.1/460.8 eV, 456/461.7 eV and 458.1/463.8 eV, which are attributed to Ti-C, Ti2+ and Ti3+, respectively (Fig. 2c) [9,55]. The La 3d 3/2 peaks and Ni 2p 3/2 are interfered with each other, as shown in Fig. 2(d). La 3d spectrum can be fitted by considering two contributions: 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2, located at 835.9 and 852.7 eV respectively, which are assigned to La3+ [50,56]. Ni 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 peaks at 856.0 and 873.6 eV with the corresponding two shakeup satellite peaks can be assigned to Ni2+ (Fig. 2e and Fig. S11a) [57–59]. In Fig. 2(f), two fitted peaks at 711.3 and 724.9 eV stem from to the Fe 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 of Fe3+ (Fig. S11b) [60,61]. Compared with pristine NiFe-LDHs/v-MXene, the peaks of Fe 2p of NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene shift to lower binding energies with an offset of 0.5 eV, which implies La with lower electronegativity (1.1) may substitute Fe with a higher electronegativity of 1.83, and interact with the remaining adjacent Fe in trimetallic NiFeLa LDH. The binding energies of Ni 2p increase by 0.6 eV after the incorporation of La3+, indicating an increasing energy of d-band center of Ni on LDH, resulting in a less occupied antibonding states between LDH and adsorbed O intermediates, which is favorable to enhance the O binding strength and HER/OER activities [62]. 3.2 Electrochemical HER performance The electrocatalytic performance of NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF was measured by using it as the free-standing electrode. Fig. 3(a) shows the LSV curves tested at 10 mV s−1. NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF displayed a lower overpotential of 38 mV than Pt/C/NF (52 mV) to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (η 10), while v-MXene/NF, NiFeLa-LDH/NF and NiFe-LDH/v-MXene/NF show much higher η 10 of 184, 141 and 183 mV. Such results suggest that the HER activity of this catalyst mainly originates from NiFeLa-LDH since v-MXene/NF is less active than NiFeLa-LDH/NF and NiFeLa-LDH loaded v-MXene/NF. The HER activity is boosted by the synergy of La doping and modified electronic structure of LDHs and MXene. In addition, the designed hierarchically porous electrode is another factor that boosts the HER performance, which can be proved by the higher η 10 (136 mV) of NiFeLa-LDH/MXene/NF. Overpotentials of 315, 334 and 234 mV are respectively required for NiFeLa-LDH/NF, NiFe-LDH/v-MXene/NF and NiFeLa-LDH/MXene/NF to acquire 350 mA cm−2, while low overpotentials of only 213 and 233 mV are needed for NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF to reach 350 and 500 mA cm−2, respectively, further verified its enhanced electrocatalytic activity. The Tafel slope of NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF (40 mV dec−1) is close to that of Pt/C/NF (32 mV dec−1), as shown in Fig. 3(b), indicating a Volmer-Heyrovsky HER mechanism. The larger Tafel slopes of NiFe-LDH/v-MXene/NF (72 mV dec−1), NiFeLa-LDH/MXene/NF (88 mV dec−1), NiFeLa-LDH/NF (57 mV dec−1) and v-MXenes/NF (135 mV dec−1) demonstrate that coupling La doping and MXene with designed hierarchically porous structure can efficiently accelerate the Volmer step in HER. The turnover frequency (TOF) of NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF is 0.05 s−1 at the overpotential of 200 mV, which is 5–25 times higher compared with that of NiFe-LDH/v-MXene/NF (0.002 s−1), NiFeLa-LDH/MXene/NF (0.01 s−1) and NiFeLa-LDH/NF (0.008 s−1), as shown in Fig. 3(c). Excellent durability is another essential characteristic for a good electrocatalyst. Fig. 3(d) shows that the overpotential of NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF to acquire 100 mA cm−2 only increases 10 mV after cycling 2000 cycles. The chronoamperometry tests shown in Fig. 3(e) further clarifies the superior long-term durability of NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF, which potential remains stable for as long as 400 h at 100 mA cm−2, while a rapid decrease can be observed in Pt/C/NF catalyst. The fluctuation of the curve is mainly caused by the temperature difference between day and night, as evidenced by the uniform spacing of about 24 hours between two adjacent peaks. After 24 h of HER test at 100 mA cm−2, the morphology of NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF electrode has no variation, indicating its high structural stability (Fig. S12). The above discussion proves that NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF has excellent HER performance along with high durability, which is superior to the reported alkaline-efficient HER catalysts, as compared in Fig. 3(f) and Table S1. The effects of 3D vertically aligned MXene nanosheets on the HER performance of NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF have been explored. The highly conductive vertically aligned MXene can greatly enhance the charge transfer kinetics of NiFeLa-LDHs, thereby boosting the HER activity of NiFeLa-LDHs. The high-frequency region of EIS patterns shown in Fig. 4(a) demonstrates a much lower charge transfer resistance (1.72 Ω) of NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF compared with that of NiFeLa-LDH/NF (2.36 Ω), indicating the accelerated charge transfer kinetics benefited from the introduction of vertically aligned MXene. Besides, NiFe-LDH/v-MXene/NF also shows a higher charge transfer resistance of 2.80 Ω, suggesting the introduction of La dopants also contributes to the improvement of conductivity. The enhanced conductivity can reduce the potential barrier and thus improve the efficiency of HER. The activity of electrocatalyst mainly depends on the structure and active surface area of the electrode. Compared with the horizontally stacked MXene, the vertically aligned 3D interconnected MXene render the higher exposure of electrochemically active sites. The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of the electrode correlated linearly with its double-layer capacitance (C dl) in the non-Faradaic region, thus can be evaluated by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves (Figs. S13 and S14). As shown in Fig. 4(b), v-MXene/NF exhibits a higher C dl of 6.3 mF cm−2 compared with MXene/NF (5.1 mF cm−2), and NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF also presents a higher C dl of 15.8 mF cm−2 than NiFeLa-LDH/MXene/NF and NiFeLa-LDH/NF (Fig. 4c). Higher C dl value indicates that the 3D vertically aligned MXene nanosheets expose a larger electrochemical surface area. The ECSA-normalized LSV curves were shown in Fig. S15(a), in which NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF still exhibits the highest current density, confirming the best electrocatalytic activity. The Volmer step in alkaline electrolyte introduces an additional energy barrier and govern the efficiency of HER. The sluggish Volmer step can be accelerated by strengthening the adsorption and dissociation of water molecules on the catalyst surface, thus yielding high coverage of adsorbed hydrogen atoms [33,63]. On this basis, the 3D MXene skeleton with highly hydrophilic can further accelerate the rate of water adsorption and electrode wetting, as verified by the contact angle (CA) measurement. The vertically aligned nanosheet MXene on the surface can dramatically improve the hydrophilicity of NF, proved by a decrease of CA from 122° to 0° (Fig. 4d). NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF also exhibits super hydrophilicity with a CA of 0° compared with NiFeLa-LDH/NF (CA: 97°). According to the results of EQCM tests (Fig. 4e), NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene shows 1.97 times higher capacity of water adsorption (0.156 g gcat −1) than that of NiFeLa-LDH (0.079 g gcat −1). To investigate the activation of the absorbed water, FTIR tests were also performed, as shown in Fig. 4(f). After water adsorption, the vibrations of O–H bonds in adsorbed water band of NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF occurred at 1628 cm−1, which has a red-shift of 5 cm−1 compared with NiFeLa-LDH/NF (1633 cm−1), indicating longer bonds of the adsorbed water molecules because of the activation effect [64,65]. Therefore, the introduction of 3D vertically aligned MXene nanosheets can facilitate water adsorption and dissociation, thus prompting the Volmer step and eventually enhancing the HER activity [63]. Overall, the vertically aligned MXene with rich porous structure, large exposed specific surface, high conductivity and hydrophilicity can greatly enhance the charge transfer kinetics, electrochemical active surface area, and adsorption/activation of the reactants to NiFeLa-LDHs in the solution, thereby accelerating the HER activity of NiFeLa-LDHs. 3.3 Electrochemical OER performance The OER activity of NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF was also evaluated in 1.0 M KOH. According to the LSV curves in Fig. 5(a), v-MXene/NF shows negligible activity, namely the NiFeLa-LDHs represents the active constituent for OER catalysis. Benefiting from the synergy of the La doping and MXene coupling, NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF shows low onset overpotential (η 0) of 175 mV along with a low η 10 of 191 mV, which are superior than those of NiFe-LDH/v-MXene/NF (η 0 = 221 mV, η 10 = 232 mV) and NiFeLa-LDH/NF (η 0 = 222 mV, η 10 = 249 mV), and also reduced by 55 and 127 mV respectively compared with those of RuO2/NF. To achieve the commercially required current density of 500 mA cm−2, a low overpotential of 255 mV is needed for NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF, while 306, 358 and 284 mV are required for NiFe-LDH/v-MXene/NF, NiFeLa-LDH/NF and NiFeLa-LDH/MXene/NF, respectively. The excellent OER electrocatalytic activity of NiFe-LDH/v-MXene/NF is further confirmed by its highest ECSA-normalized current density, as shown in Fig. S15(b). The OER kinetics of the electrodes is evaluated by Tafel slope (Fig. 5b). NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF displays a lowest Tafel slope of 40 mV dec−1, suggesting a markedly accelerated OER kinetics. As shown in Fig. 5(c), this catalyst also yields a superior TOF of 0.126 s−1 at an overpotential of 275 mV compared with NiFe-LDH/v-MXene/NF (0.009 s−1), NiFeLa-LDH/MXene/NF (0.015 s−1) and NiFeLa-LDH/NF (0.003 s−1). The above results confirmed the enhanced OER activity of NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF. Such excellent OER performance outperforms many recently reported catalysts, as listed in Table S2. Moreover, the high stability of the catalyst against long-term OER is verified by chronopotentiometry tests. Under a high current density of 100 mA cm−2, NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF can work stably for 1200 h, while a rapid potential rise can be observed for RuO2/NF (Fig. 5d). The excellent durability arises from the stability of the structure, which can be proved by the characterization of NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene after over 100 h working (Fig. S16). XRD pattern shows that NiFeLa-LDH remains amorphous. XPS results demonstrate the basically unchanged binding energies of Ni and Fe, and a slight decrease of La. The stable existence of La element can be further proved by the elemental mappings. SEM and TEM images confirm the stability of the 3D structure and morphology. No obvious variation of composition and morphology can be observed, indicating the high structural stability of NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF. The multi-step chronopotentiometric curve shown in Fig. 5(e) further verifies the excellent stability, in which a quick response of potential to the changes of current density is observed, and electrode can still operate steadily at the original potential for 7000 s without attenuation after the current density reverting to 100 mA cm−2. The excellent OER activity and durability of NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF highlighting the superiority of its unique construction with hierarchically 3D porous structure, which can increase the active surface area, accelerate the kinetics of electrolyte infiltration as well as electron and ionic transportation. The above discussion reveals that NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF possesses superior performance for both HER and OER, which can be attributed to the coupling of La-doped NiFe-LDH and 3D vertically aligned MXene. Though La is inactive for water splitting as a rare-earth metal, the doping of La into NiFe-LDH can still improve its electrocatalytic activity. According to the above investigation, La-doping can not only lower the charge transfer resistance, but also enhance the instinct electrocatalytic activity, evidenced by the much higher TOF of NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF than that of NiFe-LDH/v-MXene/NF in both HER and OER. Such improvement arises from the strong electronic interaction among multiple metal centers. The substitution of La with lower electronegativity for Fe results in the increased binding energy of Ni 2p as well as a less occupied antibonding states between LDH and adsorbed O intermediates, which is favorable to enhance the O binding strength and HER/OER activities [62]. The DFT + U simulation also demonstrates that doping La can significantly lower the Gibbs free energy of NiFe-LDH in Volmer step of HER and four-electron process of OER, and optimize the adsorption kinetics [66]. The contribution of 3D vertically aligned MXene can be summed up as follows: (1) v-MXene with high conductivity can accelerate electron transfer; (2) 3D aligned MXene can take full advantage of the macroporous structure of NF and improve the mass loading of the active material, which enables higher exposure of electrochemically active sites and enlarges the ECSA; (3) compared with hydrophobic bare NF, v-MXene/NF exhibits super hydrophilic property that can facilitate the adsorption and dissociation of water and thus prompting the Volmer step of HER. The synergistic effect of La-doping and 3D vertically aligned MXene endows NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF with outstanding electrocatalytic performance for water splitting. 3.4 Overall water splitting performance In light of the excellent HER and OER performance demonstrated by NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF, it was used as a bifunctional catalyst and served as both anode and cathode in an alkaline electrolyzer. Impressively, the cell can achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with a low voltage of 1.48 V, and obtain a much higher current density of 500 mA cm−2 at 1.71 V (Fig. 5f). Such performance is not only superior to RuO2/NF(+)//Pt/NF(-) coupled electrolyzer (1.63 V at 10 mA cm−2), but also comparable to recently reported bifunctional electrocatalysts such as NiFeRu-LDH/NF (1.52 V at 10 mA cm−2) [33] and Ni3S2@NiV-LDH/NF (1.53 V at 10 mA cm−2) [67], as compared in Fig. 5(g) and Table S3. Moreover, only a slight increase of the cell potential occurred during a chronopotentiometry test for as long as 400 h at 100 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5h), confirming the outstanding durability of NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF electrodes for the overall water splitting. Additionally, the Faradic efficiency is nearly 100% for overall water splitting (Fig. 5i). Benefitting from the low cell voltage, such electrolyzer can be powered by a 1.5 V AA battery (Fig. S17). The alkaline electrolyzer assembled from NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF exhibits impressive activity, durability and efficiency, showing great potential to be utilized practically for large-scale hydrogen production. 4 Conclusions In summary, we fabricate a free-standing electrode with hierarchical 3D structure by coupling La doped NiFe-LDH nanosheets onto vertically aligned MXene nanosheets on macroporous NF for boosting both alkaline HER and OER. Owing to the synergistic effect of strong electronic interactions among multiple metal centers and favorable kinetics of the hierarchical macroporous 3D structure, reinforced charge transference, enriched electrochemically active sites along with strengthened adsorption and dissociation properties of water are realized and thus the sluggish HER and OER kinetics were significantly speeded up, resulting in low overpotentials and Tafel slopes for both HER and OER. High electrocatalytic activity of NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF demonstrates an outstanding water electrolyzer, which only needs a low voltage of 1.48 V for the current density of 10 mA cm−2, along with an excellent durability of sustain for 400 h. Therefore, this work proposed a viable strategy to develop highly active bifunctional electrocatalysts for practical water electrolyzers.

        "dc:description": "The development of stable electrocatalysts with high hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) activity in alkaline electrolytes is critical to renewable energy conversion technologies, such as electrochemical water splitting. In this work, a novel strategy for engineering water splitting electrocatalysts in alkaline electrolyte was developed by synergistically coupling La-doped NiFe-layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDH) nanosheets onto three-dimensional (3D) vertically aligned MXene nanosheets on macroporous nickel foam (NF) substrates (NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF). The electrocatalytic performance of the prepared NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF is enhanced by the synergy of strong electronic interaction among multiple metal centers and unique vertically aligned porous MXene with increased active surface area, accelerated reaction kinetics and improved water adsorption and dissociation ability. To reach the commercially required current density (500 mA cm−2), the NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF exhibits greatly reduced overpotentials of 233 and 255 mV for HER and OER, respectively, along with excellent durability. Moreover, an alkaline electrolyzer driven by NiFeLa-LDH/v-MXene/NF delivers a lower cell voltage (1.71 V) compared with that of Pt/C-RuO2 couple to achieve the current density of 500 mA cm−2.",
