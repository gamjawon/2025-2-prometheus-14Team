Pattabiraman Central Electrochemical Research Institute, Karaikudi, 630006 Tamilnadu, India Received 31 July 1995; received in revised form 26 August 1996; accepted 27 August 1996 Abstract Highly dispersed palladium catalysts on carbon were prepared by reduction of their salts with various reducing agents. The crystallite parameters and metal surface area were evaluated by XRD and electrochemical techniques. The electrochemical activity for the oxidation of hydrogen, methanol, formaldehyde and ethylene glycol and reduction of oxygen was evaluated in alkaline solutions by making PTFE bonded carbon electrodes. The electrochemical activity was correlated with the catalyst properties. Pd dispersed catalysts on carbon supports exhibit high activity for the oxidation of hydrogen and ethylene glycol in alkaline medium. Their electrochemical activity is dependant upon the crystallite properties like surface area, dispersion and crystallite size. For oxygen reduction reaction, the activity can be increased by alloying with other elements. Keywords: Palladium/carbon; Electrochemistry; Fuel cells 1. Introduction Platinum and platinum group metals are the most frequently employed catalyst materials on inert supports like carbon, for the electrochemical reactions in fuel cells operating with acid or alkaline electrolytes [1-3]. Attempts have been made to obtain high surface area catalysts in order to achieve high efficiencies at low catalyst loadings [4]. The influence of support microstructure and mode of preparation of catalysts on their adsorptive and electro-catalytic properties have been given more attention. Various types of carbon like charcoal, carbon blacks, acetylene blacks and furnace blacks have been reported as supports for the noble metal catalysts [5,6]. * Corresponding author.

Pattabiraman/Applied Catalysis A: General 153 (1997) 1-20 Numerous articles have been published on the preparation and characterisation of carbon supported platinum catalysts for fuel cell applications. In preparing efficient Pt catalysts, some relevant concerns are the effect of the support pretreatment [7], the effect of reducing agents [8,9], the effect of surface active agents [10] and the electrode preparation and characterisation techniques [11]. However less attention has been paid to the palladium dispersed on carbon catalysts [12-15], while no reports on the electrochemical activity of these catalysts are published. This paper describes the preparation of dispersed Pd catalysts on various carbon supports by different techniques and their characterisation by XRD and electro- chemical methods [4]. The electrochemical activity of these catalysts for the oxidation of hydrogen, methanol, formaldehyde and ethylene glycol in acid and alkaline medium was evaluated and the results are discussed here. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation of catalysts on carbon supports Activated charcoal (AC) and fuel cell grade carbon black (Vulcan XC-72 from Cabot) were used as catalyst supports. These carbons were subjected to a high temperature heat treatment in NH3 atmosphere at 900 for 6 h followed by treatment in CO2 atmosphere for 24 h according to the method described by Shukla [16]. The resulting carbons had the following BET surface area values: Activated carbon =233 m2/g and Vulcan XC-72-245 m2/g. The Pd salts PdC12 and the amine salt Pd(NH3)2(NO2)2 from (Arora Mathey, India) were used as the source materials. Various reduction techniques like incipient wetness technique and reduction with reducing agents like NaBH4, hydrazine, formaldehyde, etc. were employed to disperse Pd on the carbon supports in a similar fashion reported for the Pt catalysts on the carbon supports [17]. The prepared catalysts were heat-treated in hydrogen at 673 K for 1 h. 2.2. Characterisation of catalysts The XRD patterns of the prepared catalysts were obtained with a JEOL Model 8030 X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kct radiation. The crystallite size was estimated by using the Scherrer's equation [18]. Assuming spherical morphology for the crystallites, the specific surface area (S in m2/g) was calculated using the equation S = 6000/d r, where d is the crystallite size in nm and r is the density of Pd [13]. The dispersion values (D), the ratio of number of surface atoms to the total number of atoms is calculated from the equation D = 1.13/d [191. R. Pattabiraman/Applied Catalysis A: General 153 (1997) 1-20 11 2.3. Preparation of porous carbon electrodes Porous carbon electrodes were fabricated by rolling and pressing technique using PTFE solution as binder as reported elsewhere [20] at different catalyst loadings. 2.4. Electrochemical measurements The electrochemical measurements were carried out in a glass cell. The electrochemical surface area of the powder samples was determined from the charge involved in the reduction of the oxidelayer, from the cyclic voltammograms in 1.0 M H2SO4 solutions, assuming a value of 405 ~tC/cm2 for a monolayer coverage [21,22]. PAR Model 370 Electrochemistry System was employed to obtain the potentio-dynamic curves. The electrode assembly employed for the steady-state galvanostatic polarisation studies has been described earlier [20]. Steady-state polarisation curves were obtained for hydrogen oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions in 6.0 M KOH solutions at 353 K. The steady-state polarisation curves were also obtained for the anodic oxidation of methanol, formaldehyde and ethylene glycol (1.0 M) in 1.0 M KOH solutions using mercuric oxide as reference electrode. The potentials were not corrected for IR drop. 3. Results and discussions 3.1. Physical characteristics of palladium catalysts on carbon supports 3.1.1. Wet impregnation (incipient reduction) method Table 1 summarises the parameters of the catalysts prepared by wet impreg- nation method. Two precursors namely PdC12 in HC1 and Pd-P salt Pd(NH3)2(NO2)2 were used. Catalysts were prepared at different weight ratios 1, 2, 5, and 10 wt% on the two carbon supports, namely activated carbon and Table 1 Characteristics of palladium catalysts (wet impregnation method) Catalyst Catalyst loading Precursor Crystal size Metal surface Dispersion (wt%) (nm) area (mZ/g) (%) AC 2 Pd(NH3)2(NO2)2 1.96 1.96 266 AC 5 Pd(NH3)2(NO2)2 3.01 166 37 AC 10 Pd(NH3)2(NO2)2 5.75 87 19 XC-72 5 Pd(NH3)z(NO2)2 2.22 225 50 XC-72 10 Pd(NH3)2(NO2)2 4.82 103 23 AC 2 Pd(C1)2 2.28 219 49 AC 5 Pd(CI)2 2.76 181 40 12 R.

The XRD pattems of the different catalyst samples indicated a broad peak at 20 around 25 corresponding to the reflections from 002 plane of the carbon support. The Pd 111 phase with 20 at 40was predominant in all the samples, the intensity values decreasing with the decrease in the Pd content on the carbons. The crystallite values were smaller for the high surface area carbon (XC-72) and decreasing with increase in the catalyst loadings. Consequently, the metal surface area and dispersion values were higher at lower catalyst loadings. The Pd-P salt results in high surface area catalysts than the PdC12 precursor. 3.1.2. Chemical reduction method The characteristics of the Pd catalysts on AC, prepared from PdC12 solution with different reducing agents are indicated in Table 2. In all the cases the catalyst loading was kept at 5 wt%. Chemical reduction of Pd is reported to yield very fine crystallites compared to Pt and the reduction process was reported to be completed quickly at temperatures below 373 K [23]. All reducing agents except hydrogen result in crystallites with metal surface area below 160 m2/g which is smaller than the values obtained by incipient technique. NaBH4 results in highly agglomerated Pd black catalysts. This is quite contradictory to the results reported for the Pt catalysts on carbon [ 11 ]. Generally the crystallite size values for the heat treated Pd catalysts are higher than the Pt catalysts obtained by similar methods and reported elsewhere [17] and that is ascribed to the fact that the Pd particles start sintering more readily than Pt at temperatures above 373 K [24]. 3.2. Electrochemical characterisation No attempt has been made to determine the dispersion values from hydrogen chemisorption method in the present investigation, since the hydrogen adsorption region on Pd consists of both adsorbed and absorbed hydrogen [25]. Electro- chemical methods like potentio-dynamic method [26] and galvanostatic charging curve method [27] were reported in the literature to characterise the hydrogen R.

The former technique was employed in the present investigation and the results are discussed below. 3.2.1. Hydrogen adsorption region The characteristic voltammograms in 1.0 M H2804 for the Pd catalysts 1 to 10 wt% on AC are shown in Fig. 1. At high catalyst loadings the pattern is very similar to one reported for a Pd wire electrode [26]. At low catalyst loadings the multiplicity of peaks appear in the hydrogen region in the anodic and the cathodic branch. The anodic portion consists of two peaks. The first peak below 100 mV corresponds to the oxidation of dissolved hydrogen in the metal and the second one in the potential region 200-400 mV corresponds to the oxidation of chemisorbed hydrogen [28]. Similarly in the cathodic branch the peak due to the adsorption occurs first, followed by hydrogen absorption peaks. 14 R.

[28]. From this knowledge of the adsorbed hydrogen, the surface area and dispersion values were calculated and the values Hads/Pdtota1 and Htotal/Pd are indicated in the Table 3. The dispersion values from Htotal/Pd are comparable with the values in Table 1 and Table 2 for the different catalysts. 3.2.2. Oxide reduction region Since Pd on carbon system exhibits a poor definition of the hydrogen region, the quantity of electricity used in the reduction of palladium oxide formed over the top layer of the Pd particles, probably as a form of PdO, is employed in calculating the specific surface area. The oxide reduction peak appears near 0.45 V vs. SCE and is slightly more negative than the corresponding peak for bulk Pd. The peak also shifts to more negative potentials with decreasing particle size of Pd. A charge value of 405 ~tC/cm2 is assumed for the reduction of PdO monolayer [22]. The surface area values determined electrochemically from the oxide reduction charge are tabulated in Table 4 for the different catalysts. The dispersion values determined by the above method proved to be a standard procedure for Pd and its alloys, since the uncertainties associated with the resolution of hydrogen peaks are avoided. Table 3 and Table 4 indicate the following decreasing sequence for the surface area of the catalysts depending on the reducing agents H2 > HCOONa > HCHO > hydrazine > NaBH4. This sequence is of the same order as found by the XRD technique (Table 2). But the R.

With decreasing particle size, when the amount of Pd in the catalyst decreases from 10 to 1.0 wt%, the surface area of the metal increases. Comparing Table 3 and Table 4, it is clear that there is a direct relationship between the quantity of charge involved in the strongly bonded hydrogen and that for the reduction of the PdO monolayer. This ratio is close to 1 : 2, since the reduction of the oxide layer involves 2 faradaic charge per mole. From Table 3 it is clear that the ratio between the strongly bonded to the total hydrogen increases with the catalyst loadings. In other words at low catalyst loadings the amount of adsorbed (strongly bonded) hydrogen is higher due to increased surface area. A similar phenomena has also been reported in gas phase chemisorption and ascribed to the changes in the heat of adsorption values [29]. 3.3. Steady-state polarisation studies in alkaline medium 3.3.1. Hydrogen oxidation reaction The steady-state galvanostatic anodic polarisation curves for the hydrogen oxidation reaction in 6.0 M KOH at 353 K with the porous gas diffusion electrodes are shown in Fig. 2. The hydrogen gas pressure was 0.3 kg cm2 (gauge pressure). All the electrodes established a reversible potential above -900 mV vs. Hg,HgO/ OH- electrode. The potentials were not corrected for IR drop. Electrodes contain- ing high surface area catalysts had a lower polarisation. Among the various reducing agents, reduction with hydrogen gave high surface area catalysts exhibit- ing lowest polarisation. NaBH4 gave bigger crystallites which resulted in higher polarisation. High surface area catalysts can be well distributed over the entire surface of the electrode and hence high catalyst utilisation can be achieved [30]. The over-potentials (ETA) at constant current density, specific activity and current density values at a constant potential of -800 mV vs. reference electrode are 16 R.

From this table it is clear that current densities in the range 100-200 ma/cm2 can be achieved from the hydrogen oxidation reaction at 353 K in 6.0 M KOH solutions depending on the catalyst properties, which in turn depend on their preparation conditions. These electrodes can successfully be employed as hydrogen anodes in hydrogen-oxygen alkaline fuel cells. 3.3.2.

Galvanostatic polarisation curves for oxygen reduction in alkaline medium on porous Pd/C electrodes (Nos. correspond to Table 4). catalysts with high dispersion values show lower polarisation than bigger size catalysts. However the polarisation values are larger than Pt catalysts reported elsewhere [20]. The activity values and current densities at -200 mV vs. Hg,HgO/ OH- are compared in Table 5. From this it is clear that current densities of the order of 60-80 ma/cm2 could be realised while employing these electrodes as oxygen cathodes in alkaline fuel cells. An improvement in the activity of these catalysts could be achieved by alloying Pd with either Pt, Ru, Rh and Ag for the oxygen reduction reaction [31]. 3.4. Electro-oxidation of organic fuels Electro-oxidation of organic compounds like methanol, formaldehyde and ethylene glycol has gained importance in recent years with the development of liquid fuel cells [32]. Electro-oxidation of formaldehyde and glycol has been reported on Pd catalysts [33,34]. However highly dispersed catalysts have not been studied for the same. Methanol oxidation does not take place either in acid or alkaline medium on dispersed Pd catalysts. However significant current densities were obtained at different potentials for the anodic oxidation of HCHO and glycol in alkaline medium. The over-potential values were calculated as the deviation from the equilibrium potentials which were close to the reversible thermodynamic values of -0.22 Vand - 0.20 V vs. Hg,HgO/OH in HCHO and glycol solutions. The over- potential current density relationship for the oxidation of HCHO and glycol for the various catalysts has been shown in Fig. 4 and 5 respectively. The catalyst with the high catalyst loading (10 wt%) on XC-72 exhibited the lowest polarisation. Over- potential values were higher for electrodes containing bigger crystallites. The 18 R.

It is possible to realise 100 ma/cm2 at an over-potential of 150 mV for the oxidation of the above fuels. An improvement in the proper dispersion of the Pd catalysts on carbon substrates could lead to high current densities at desired over-potentials for all these electrode reactions. 4. Summary Pd dispersed catalysts on carbon supports exhibit high activity for the oxidation of hydrogen and ethylene glycol in alkaline medium. Their electrochemical activity is dependent upon the crystallite properties like surface area, dispersion and crystallite size. For oxygen reduction, the activity can be increased by alloying with other elements. References [1] K. Kinoshita, J. Lundquist and E Stonehart, J. Catal., 33 (1973) 325. [2] D.S.

Highly dispersed palladium catalysts on carbon were prepared by reduction of their salts with various reducing agents. The crystallite parameters and metal surface area were evaluated by XRD and electrochemical techniques. The electrochemical activity for the oxidation of hydrogen, methanol, formaldehyde and ethylene glycol and reduction of oxygen was evaluated in alkaline solutions by making PTFE bonded carbon electrodes. The electrochemical activity was correlated with the catalyst properties. Pd dispersed catalysts on carbon supports exhibit high activity for the oxidation of hydrogen and ethylene glycol in alkaline medium. Their electrochemical activity is dependant upon the crystallite properties like surface area, dispersion and crystallite size. For oxygen reduction reaction, the activity can be increased by alloying with other elements. Keywords Palladium/carbon Electrochemistry Fuel cells References [1] K. Kinoshita J. Lundquist P.
