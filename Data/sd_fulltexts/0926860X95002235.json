It was accom- panied by a relative growth of the contribution of vanadyl plane (001) of VOHPO4\" 0.5H20 which transforms into the topologically similar (100) plane of ( VO ) 2P207. The mechanochemical treatment of the V-P-O catalysts containing bismuth changes the sample morphology, favouring the formation of the vanadyl plane and provoking surface chemical reaction. The data obtained for V-P-O/BiPO4 and V-P-O/BizO3 samples demonstrate that mechanochemistry is a new promising method for the introduction of promoting additives into the basic V-P-O composition. Keywords: Butane oxidation; Maleic anhydride; Mechanochemical treatment; Phosphorus; Vanadia 1. Introduction Introduction of promoting additives to the basic V-P-O catalyst is one of the methods to improve its catalytic properties. Review of the literature data on n- butane partial oxidation shows that in commercial applications, promoted vana- dium-phosphorus (V-P-Me-O) catalysts are used [1-3]. Moreover, studies of the role played by the nature of the additives (Me), the method of their introduction and the phase in which they are present, are still in progress [4-8]. In our recent work [9] it has been found, that the additives may be present in four types of * Corresponding author. 0926-860X/96/$15.00 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

It has also been shown, that among them, those with the highest perspective for improving the catalytic properties of the V-P-O compositions are the additives which form ortho- or pyrophosphates. Somewhat later [ 10] the positive effect of the addition of cobalt phosphate on the catalytic properties of (VO)2P207 in n- butane selective oxidation has been demonstrated. Our prediction concerning the positive effect of the introduction of metal phosphate has recently been confirmed [ 11 ]. On the other hand it has been shown that mechanical milling changes the morphology and thereby may improve the catalytic properties [ 12,13 ]. The present paper concerns the effect of bismuth additive and the method of its introduction on the properties of V-P-O catalysts in n-butane selective oxidation. It is based on mechanochemical treatment which not only modifies the morphology but is one of the prospective methods in solid-state syntheses of new compounds [ 14,15 ], apart form being an effective way for catalyst preparation. 2. Experimental The V-P-O catalyst was prepared by mixing V205 and butanol (1:10) with the addition of H3PO4 (P/V = 1.15) and heating at 110 for 30 h [ 9 ]. For the synthesis of V-P-Bi-O samples the bismuth additive was introduced in the form of Bi (NO3) 3\" 5H20 simultaneously with V205 (Bi/V = 0.1 ). The V-P-O/Bi203 and V-P-O/BiPO4 (Bi/V=0.1) preparations were obtained by mixing in an agate mortar the powders of the V-P-O precursor and commercial Bi203 or BiPO4 powders, respectively. The samples were mechanochemically treated in a planetary mill (3000 rpm) in an ethanol suspension for 10 min. The phase composition of the samples was analyzed using a Toshiba powder X- ray diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation. The specific surface area of the samples was measured by the BET method on an ASAP-2000. Derivatograms of the samples were recorded with the thermoanalytical instrument, Derivatograph Q-1500 D (System F. Paulik-J. Paulik-L. Erdey) in helium atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 K/min. The surface composition was examined using an VG ESCA-3 X-ray photoelec- tron spectrometer (A1 Kal,2). The spectra were calibrated against the C 1 s (284.8 eV) line as a standard in the binding energy determination. Details of the measure- ment and data processing are given in [ 10]. Catalytic properties of the synthesized samples in n-butane ( 1.5 vol.-% in air) oxidation were examined in a flow system with gas chromatographic control of the reaction products [ 10]. Prior to the catalytic tests the samples were activated by heating up to 440 during 60 h in the reaction mixture. V.A. Zazhigalov et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 135 (1996) 155-161 157 3. Results The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all samples revealed the presence of the line set of VOHPO4 0.5H20 with the most intensive peaks at d = 0.570, 0.453, 0.367, 0.311, 0.294, 0.279 and 0.266 nm. Besides this, additional peak sets were present, in V-P-O/Bi203 with most intense lines at d = 0.343, 0.324, 0.270, 0.240 and 0.196 nm and in V-P-O/BiPO4 at d=0.442, 0.352, 0.303, 0.286, 0.237 and 0.216 nm, well corresponding with those for Bi203 and BiPO4, respectively. The intensity ratio 10.570/10.294 of the 0.570 nm peak representing the (001) reflection and 0.294 nm peak of the (220) reflection and the ratio of the 0.294/0.570 peak widths at half-maximum (Rp) in mechanical mixtures and the V-P-O sample were almost the same (Table 1 ) indicating that mechanical mixing induces no changes of the crystal habit of V-P-O crystallites. The temperatures of endo- and exothermic effects (Table 1 ) observed in the differential thermal analysis (DTA) and assigned to the decomposition of VOHPO4\" 0.5H20 with the formation of amorphous van- adyl pyrophosphate and crystallization of vanadyl pyrophosphate, respectively: T(endo) T(endo) T(exo) VOHPO4\"0.5H20 ~ [VOHPO4] ~ [(VO)2P2Ov]amorph\" ~ [(VO)2P207]cryst' [ 16,17] were the same for the initial sample and mechanical mixtures. Mechanical mixing of the V-P-O catalysts and bismuth compounds did not change their specific surface area, an introduction of bismuth during the catalyst synthesis (V-P-Bi-O sample) decreased it a little. This was accompanied by an increase in the intensity of the 0.570 nm peak.

The temperature of the phase transition from vanadyl hydrophosphate semihydrate into vanadyl pyrophosphate did not change significantly. Mechanochemical treatment increases the specific surface area of all prepara- tions: pure V-P-O, its mixtures with Bi203 or BiPO4 as well as V-P-Bi-O. This increase is enhanced by the presence of bismuth. The temperature of the phase transition into vanadyl pyrophosphate decreases, especially for V-P-O/BiPO4 sample. In addition, the mechanochemical treatment resulted in the increase of the VOHPO4\"0.5H20 peak at 0.570 nm to such an extent that it became the most dominating one. For changes in the peak width ratios (Rp), see Table 1. In the case of V-P-Bi-O samples, after mechanochemical treatment additional peaks, due to bismuth phosphate, were observed. XRD patterns of V-P-O/Bi203 were significantly changed. The lines with d = 0.343 and 0.240 nm have disappeared while the intensity of others, namely with d=0.324, 0.270 and 0.196 nm, has decreased by more than two. At the same time, all peaks corresponding to the bismuth phosphate (see above) appeared. The results of the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements are given in Table 2. As can be seen, the mechanical mixing of V-P-O precursor with bismuth oxide or phosphate does not change the surface state of the sample. The measured binding energies of Bi 4f electrons correspond to the reference data [ 18 ] for individual Bi203 and BiPO4. A considerably increased value of Bi 4f binding energy was observed in the V-P-Bi-O sample, while those for the other elements remained unchanged, in respect to V-P-O. In addition, it should be noted that introduction of bismuth into the catalyst during synthesis leads to an increase of the surface ratio P/V (Table 2). The mechanochemical treatment causes an increase of the surface P/V ratio in all cases. The binding energy of Bi 4f electrons after milling V-P-O/BiPO4 and V-P-O/Bi203 mixtures increased and attained the value observed in V-P-Bi-O preparations. The binding energy for other elements remains unchanged, except the contributory peak at the high-B.E, side of the P 2p band in the V-P-O/Bi203 sample. The surface Bi/V ratio decreases in V-P-O/BiPO4 and V-P-O/Bi203 Table 2 Surface properties (XPS) of the samples Samples Binding energy of electrons (eV) ( P/V)~ (Bi/V)~ V 2p3/2 Bi 4f7/2 P2p O ls(l) O ls(2) V-P-O 517.5 - 133.9 531.7 533,5 1.43 - V-P-O/Bi203 517.5 158.9 133.9 531.6 533.5 1.47 0.09 V-P~O/BiPO4 517.6 159.3 133.8 531.5 533.3 1.44 0.10 V-P-Bi-O 517.4 159.9 133.7 531.5 533.3 1.82 0.12 V-P-O/BizO3-MCh 517.6 159.7 134.0 531.7 533.4 2.02 0.02 136.7 V P-O/BiPO4-MCh 517.2 160.2 133.6 531.4 533.0 1.96 0.03 V-P-Bi-O-MCh 517.4 160.0 133.7 531.6 533.3 2.09 0.18 V.A.

Catalytic activities of the studied samples in n-butane oxidation are summarized in Table 1. One can see that the mechanical mixing of V-P-O precursor with Bi203 and BiPO4 decreases the selectivity towards maleic anhydride. Conversely, intro- duction of bismuth simultaneously with VzOs during the synthesis of the catalyst (V-P-Bi-O) increases the activity and selectivity of the n-butane partial oxidation. Mechanochemical treatment of the catalysts containing the bismuth additive leads to an increase of their activity in n-butane oxidation and selectivity to maleic anhydride. The most active catalyst for n-butane partial oxidation was V-P-O/ BiPO4-Mch prepared by means of mechanochemical introduction of the bismuth additive into the basic matrix. 4. Discussion The data obtained show that mixing the V-P-O precursor with Bi203 or BiPO4 powder (grinding in agate mortar) practically does not influence the properties of the basic VOHPO4\"0.5H20 phase (Table 1 and Table 2). The bismuth com- pounds, as was found by means of XRD and XPS studies, have remained in the unchanged initial state, Bi203 and BiPO4, respectively. The introduction of bismuth into the catalyst during the synthesis (V-P-Bi-O sample) leads to a slightly decreased specific surface area but intensity of the XRD peak at 0.570 nm (Table 1) and phosphorus surface concentration (Table 2) increase slightly. XRD spectra show that the additive is forming the bismuth phos- phate phase. The binding energy of B i 4f electrons in the V-P-Bi-O sample exceeds the value characteristic of bismuth phosphate (Table 2). This chemical shift of Bi 4f electrons, can be produced by a polarization of bismuth electrons due to its interaction with oxide ions of the vanadium phosphate matrix. Since such effects require a direct interaction at the atomic scale, it can also be taken as an indication of the fine dispersion of bismuth atoms, probably their incorporation into the basic VOHPO4\" 0.5H20 composition. The introduction of bismuth into the basic matrix during the precursor synthesis improves somewhat the catalytic properties of the resulting catalyst. The mechanochemical treatment of the samples caused a substantial increase of the 0.570 nm line intensity in XRD patterns which testifies for a relative growth of the exposure of the vanadyl plane (001) in the sample [17]. It is known [ 16,17] that the (001) plane of the VOHPO4\" 0.5H20 phase transforms into the topologi- cally similar (100) plane of (WO)2P207, which is believed to be responsible for the catalytic activity in n-butane oxidation [ 19,20]. The observed lowering of the phase transition temperature (Table 1 ) has a beneficial effect on the formation of this plane. The observed gain of the parameter Rp demonstrates a decrease of the VOHPO4\" 0.5H20 plate thickness [21] and agrees well with the increase of the surface area of the samples mentioned above. 160 V.A. Zazhigalov et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 135 (1996) 155-161 The presented results show that the precursor morphology is essentially affected by the mechanochemical treatment. Such changes can be connected with a suffi- ciently high local overheating ( A T= 600-700) appearing during the treatment, which is capable to induce chemical reactions and the synthesis of new compounds [22-24]. The fundamental changes in the state of V-P-O/Bi203 shown in this work are also an evidence of the proceeding of the chemical reaction. Namely, after the mechanochemical treatment the XRD peak characteristic of bismuth phosphate appeared and those of bismuth oxide disappeared in the XRD patterns, while the binding energy of Bi 4f electrons increased by 0.8 eV and attained the value observed in the case of bismuth incorporated to VOHPOa'0.5H20 (V-P-Bi-O sample). This rise of chemical shift in XPS Bi 4f band indicates the change in the electronic state of bismuth atoms produced by a polarization of bismuth electrons as the result of its high dispersion in the vanadium phosphate matrix. The comparison of the catalytic properties of the samples (Table 1 ) indicates that the mechanochemical treatment leads to an increase of both catalytic activity in n-butane oxidation and selectivity towards maleic anhydride. The most efficient catalysts are V-P-O/BiPO4-Mch and V-P-O/Bi2Q-Mch prepared by means of mechanochemistry from mechanical mixtures of VOHPO4\" 0.5H20 and BiPO4 or Bi203. In the last case Bi203 transforms to BiPO4. In our opinion, the catalytic performance of the V-P-Bi-O-Mch sample is not good enough due to the high concentration of bismuth phosphate on the catalyst surface. Thus, the results obtained show that bismuth added to the V-P-O catalyst is finely dispersed, improving the catalytic performance in n-butane partial oxidation. The mechanochemical treatment of V-P-O catalysts containing bismuth changes the sample morphology, favouring the formation of the (001) plane with the exposed vanadyl oxygen atoms. The data obtained for V-P-O/BiPO4 and V-P- O/Bi203 samples demonstrate that the mechanochemistry is a new promising method for the introduction of promoting additives into the basic V-P-O composition.

Niezapominajek, Krakow 30239, Poland * Corresponding author. The mechanochemical treatment of the VPO catalysts caused a substantial increase of both the catalytic activity in n-butane oxidation and the selectivity towards maleic anhydride. It was accompanied by a relative growth of the contribution of vanadyl plane (001) of VOHPO4·0.5H2O which transforms into the topologically similar (100) plane of (VO)2P2O7. The mechanochemical treatment of the VPO catalysts containing bismuth changes the sample morphology, favouring the formation of the vanadyl plane and provoking surface chemical reaction. The data obtained for VPO/BiPO4 and VPO/Bi2O3 samples demonstrate that mechanochemistry is a new promising method for the introduction of promoting additives into the basic VPO composition.
