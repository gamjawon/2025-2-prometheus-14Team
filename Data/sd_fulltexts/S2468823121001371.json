However, the active site and reaction mechanism are still remaining unresolved due to the complicated valence of chromium and co-exists of several active sites. In this work, DFT calculations are performed to reveal the nature of active center and reaction mechanism for the supported chromium catalyst on silica. Three valences of chromium including Cr3+, Cr5+, and Cr6+ are examined to give a unbiased survey of reactivity. The reaction pathway and C–H activation are carefully examined. Moreover, a detailed analysis of active site regeneration is performed. The reactivities of different oxygen groups attached to Cr including terminal, bridge, and OH group are evaluated at the same footing. Furthermore, the calculations also reveal the intrinsic catalytic properties of chromium which show comparable abilities with oxygen groups. The influence from OH group on support is also evaluated. The comparisons of different reaction pathway give useful indication on the possible reaction mechanism. In the end, the most favorable active site is identified. The current work not only deepen the understanding of catalytic properties of supported chromium catalyst but also supply the doable optimization methods for further improvements. Keywords DFT Chromium oxide Support Propane dehydrogenation 1 Introduction The propene is one of the most important building block for chemical industry and the raw materials for the synthesis of polypropylene, propylene cyanide, epoxide etc [1]. The steady increasing demands strain the production of propene worldwide in recent years. The situation also induces the impetus to further improve the efficiency of propene production. Conventionally, propene is obtained from the cracking of naphtha or the side products of oil catalytic cracking [2]. The process is energy intensive and has low yields. In contrast, the on-purpose catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is an efficient route to acquire propene with high selectivity which attracted much attentions [3]. Moreover, the newly found large reservoir of Shale gas supplied abundance of short alkanes including methane, ethane, and propane which also need a viable application to exploit the resource [4,5]. Hence, catalytic dehydrogenation of propane meets this opportunity to utilize alkane resource. There are two different ways for catalytic dehydrogenation of propane which are direct and oxidative dehydrogenation respectively [6]. The major difference between them is that whether an oxidant is in use or not. For direct dehydrogenation of propane (DHP), reaction is highly endothermic and runs at elevated temperature around 600 °C. The selectivity of propene is high, but the large amount of cokes formed during reaction severely reduce the stability of catalyst and require the frequent regeneration [7]. The introduction of oxidant like oxygen in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reduced cokes during reaction to some extents. However, the intermediates in reaction and propene can undergo deep reaction which lowered the selectivity under oxidizing atmosphere [8]. Due to this obstacle, ODHP has not yet been implemented in industry until now. On the other hand, DHP technology has been commercialized for propene production. Oleflex and Catofin are two major industrial technologies for DHP process [9]. Platinum was used as catalyst in Oleflex. Platinum catalysts show excellent selectivity towards propene and decent stability. But platinum is sensitive to the impurity. Also the high price and scarcity of platinum hinder the further application in DHP. Chromium oxide is the catalyst used in Catofin. Compared with platinum, chromium catalyst is not sensitive to impurity and has advantages regarding of yields and cost [10]. However, chromium is toxic and detrimental to environmental protection. Therefore, the low loading, highly dispersed chromium catalysts can potentially decrease the environmental impacts and have vital importance for further developments [11,12]. One of the remaining intriguing questions for chromium oxide catalyst in DHP is to identify of active site because Cr has several valences including +2, +3, +5, +6 etc [13–18] All of these valances have been observed on chromium catalyst in DHP which caused an uncertainty on the active site assignment. Shen et al. studied CrOx/SiO2 in DHP from ESR measurement [19]. They identified that Cr5+ was the active site with a comparison with Cr3+ species. In another study, Chen et al. successfully synthesized a series of chromium catalysts supported on mesoporous silica with impregnation method [20]. They concluded that Cr3+ species were more influential on the catalytic performance than Cr6+. In our previous work [15], the isolated or oligomeric Cr3+ were identified as active center in propane dehydrogenation with in-situ/operando Raman during reaction. The complexity revealed from above-mentioned studies was partly attributed to the facile conversion between various Cr species under oxidative/reductive condition [21–23]. The different experimental setups in these studies also hinder an unambiguous identification of active center [24–26]. Moreover, the detailed description of reaction mechanism of DHP on chromium catalyst is still absent. In this work, first principles calculations were performed to deepen understandings on the active center and mechanism of chromium catalyst in DHP. The structure models are constructed for chromium catalysts with different valences (Cr3+、 Cr5+、 Cr6+) and functional groups (CrO、CrOH、CrOS i、isolated Cr). The interactions between reactant/product and active sites are carefully calibrated and the complete reaction pathways are revealed. The current work lays out the solid base for the further development of chromium catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. 2 Computational setup All the calculations were done by using the Gaussian 09 software [27]. The Electronic energies of the reactant, product and transition state were computed within density functional theory. B3LYP was used as exchange and correlation approximation. The geometries of the ground and transition state were optimized by using 6−311G** basis set. The core electrons of Cr are described by the effective-core potential LANL2DZ. All the atoms are allowed to relaxed in the geometry optimization. The ground and transition state were determined by the vibrational frequency calculation. The transition state has one and only one imagery frequency. Free energies were determined within the rigid-rotor, harmonic-oscillator approximation. The translational, rotational and vibrational partition functions were included in the calculation of standard free energies. The change in electronic energy was corrected by the zero point corrections. The cluster model was adopted in current work as shown in Fig. 1 which have been verified to be effective to describe catalytic process of catalytic dehydrogenation [28–30]. The NBO method was employed to perform charge analysis [31]. For the graphical representation, GaussView 5.0 software was used [32]. The calculations of the thermodynamic properties are done at 873 K, which is consistent with the temperature of the related experiment [33]. 3 Results and discussions 3.1 The optimized catalyst structure The silica was chosen as support for the investigated chromium catalysts and three valences of chromium including +3, +5, and +6 were under considerations. For silica, OH groups were ubiquitous and the influences were well documented in literature. Hence, two different support models were constructed as shown in Figs. 1 and S1. An isolated chromium atom was anchored on silica. For Cr6+, there is one bridge oxygen group (Ob, CrOSi) and two terminal oxygens (Ot, CrO) respectively. For Cr5+, there is one OH group bonding with Cr besides a bridge and terminal oxygen. For Cr3+, it was coordinated with bridge and OH group respectively. The bond distance between Cr and various oxygen groups were shown in Table S1. The bond distance between Cr and Ot was shorter than the other groups which is 1.56 Å and can be attributed to a double bond. The bond distance with OH and Ob is slightly longer which is in range of 1.73 and 1.82 Å. Moreover, OH group on support did not bring a noticeable influence on the bond distance as shown in Table S1. On the other hand, the different coordinations have a major impact on the electronic structure of Cr. First of all, the valence of isolated Cr was examined by the NBO charge analysis. It was clearly indicated that the charges were reduced along Cr3+, Cr5+ and Cr6+ which has 1.25, 0.90, and 0.74 e respectively. It was also noted that the charges are mainly transferred from Cr to Ob and OH group. On the other hand, charges of Ot did not change too much. The PDOS analysis of Cr was also presented in Fig. 2 . It was clearly indicated that PDOS is gradually pushed towards to Fermi level along Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+ and more states were populated at Fermi level for Cr3+ which implies the increased reactivities. 3.2 The reaction pathway of Cr6+ The reaction pathway of DHP on supported Cr6+ was shown in Fig. 3 . Both Ot and Ob sites were explored to activate CH bond in propane. At first step, propane weakly adsorbed at Ob and Ot sites with an adsorption energy of 0.005 and −0.19 eV respectively. The distance between the secondary hydrogen and oxygen is 3.02 and 2.75 Å for Ob and Ot respectively. The first hydrogen abstraction is often deemed as most difficult step of propane dehydrogenation. The calculated barrier of first hydrogen abstraction is 2.10 and 2.29 eV at Ot and Ob sites respectively. At transition state (TS), hydrogen was captured by oxygen and CH bond was completely broken with a distance of 1.67 and 1.40 Å at Ot and Ob sites. Consequently, the activated propane molecule dissociated into two fragments, H* and C3H7*. The C3H7 fragment was then binding at Ot as shown in Fig. 3. The second hydrogen abstraction take place at terminal oxygen site. The corresponding barriers of TS2 were calculated to be 1.25 and 1.96 eV respectively for Ot and Ob sites. It is noted that barriers of second hydrogen abstraction was lower than the counterpart of first hydrogen. After second hydrogen abstraction, propene was formed and desorb from the catalyst. To maintain a stable catalytic cycle, the actives sites were required to regenerate as oxygen sites are converted to be hydroxyls. Two hydroxyls groups interacted with each other and two hydrogens were approaching as shown in TS3 with a distance of 0.93 and 0.91 Å respectively. The barriers of TS3 were calculated to be 2.32 and 2.54 eV which are even bigger than TS1. After hydrogen molecule desorption, the active sites are regenerated and a catalytic cycle was completed. Considering all calculated barriers, it is suggested that Ot site is more favorable than Ob. On the other hand, the reaction pathway on silica with pre-adsorbed OH was also explored and shown in Fig. S2. It is quite similar to the counterparts on silica support without OH which also was consisted with first, second hydrogen abstraction, propene formation and desorption, and regeneration. The OH group has an obvious impact on the barrier of hydrogen abstraction which was increased. Hence, it seems to suggest that OH group on silica support is not favorable for CH bond activation for Cr6+. 3.3 The reaction pathway of Cr5+ Cr5+ has one less terminal oxygen compared with Cr6+. Hence, there is no Ot- Ot site available. Regarding of the site to active first CH bond in propane, there were two different reaction pathways initiated at terminal and bridge oxygen as shown in Figs. 4 and 5 respectively. In Fig. 4, there are three routes from propane adsorption to products formation. The first CH bond activation has two different ways to proceed. The first route was that C3H7 and H co-adsorption on Ot- Ob sites after CH bond broken and barrier was calculated to 1.55 eV (TS1 on Path-I in Fig. 4). C3H7 adsorbed on Ob site and H adsorbed on Ot site respectively. The second route produced a radical-like C3H7 and H abstracted by oxygen with a barrier of 1.82 eV (TS1 on Path-II in Fig. 4). The differences between these two routes lie in the state of dissociated C3H7 which was either adsorbed at catalyst on Path 1 or radical in gas phase on Path II. On Path-I, C3H7 further lose one hydrogen which was abstracted by bridge oxygen with a barrier of 2.04 eV. After propene desorption, the left two hydrogen atoms approached to each other and formed hydrogen molecule to desorb which lead to regeneration of active site. On the other hand, the second hydrogen abstraction has two different paths after C3H7 radical formed (Path IIa and IIb) as shown in Fig. 4. C3H7 radical can interacts with either Ob or OtH, both has ability to abstract hydrogen with a barrier of 0.87 and 0.67 eV (TS2 on Path II) respectively. It was noted that these two sites had comparable performance regarding of barrier which indicate the catalytic potential of OtH. After second hydrogen abstraction, it was followed by products (propene and hydrogen molecule) formation and desorption. Similar to Cr6+, the desorption barrier of hydrogen molecule was significantly bigger than the others along pathway for Path-I and Path-IIa. Another feature observed from Path-I and Path-II in Fig. 4 was that only terminal oxygen participated in CH bond activation. On the other hand, bridge oxygen was also active for CH bond activation at Cr5+ site as shown in Fig. 5. Similar to terminal oxygen, both dissociative adsorption and radical pathways were observed for bridge oxygen for first CH bond activation. In particularly, the barrier of radical pathway was calculated to be 1.20 eV (TS1 on red pathway) which is much smaller than terminal oxygen sites and dissociative adsorption pathway. After first CH activation, the formed C3H7 radical could also lose another hydrogen via OtH or Ot sites. This verified the catalytic abilities of OtH and prompted the possibility of first hydrogen activation at OtH site. As shown in Fig. 6 , it was a little surprise to observe that barrier is much lower than either Ot or Ob sites. The dissociated C3H7* on oxygen site and C3H7 radical further undergone the second hydrogen abstraction. It was indicated that the adsorbed C3H7 has a substantial large barrier which is around 2 eV. In contrast, the barriers of hydrogen abstraction from C3H7 radical by either Ot or Ob sites were significantly reduced which is around 1 eV. However, the difficulties for the products desorption (H2 and propene) were still remained for all investigated sites. 3.4 The reaction pathway of Cr3+ The structure of Cr3+ site was different from Cr5+ and Cr6+ as terminal oxygen is absent. The coordinated oxygens with Cr3+ site were OH group and bridge oxygen as shown in Fig. 1. The first CH bond activation in propane at OH group is shown in Fig. 7 . Similar to the other sites, two different routes were presented which lead to adsorbed and radical C3H7 respectively. One interesting observation was that Cr can directly participate into CH bond activation besides oxygen sites as shown in Fig. 7. The hydrogen abstraction from C3H7 radical occurred at Cr site with only 0.49 eV barrier (TS2 on red pathway). This was evident that Cr site is capable to activate CH bond. Moreover, the desorption barrier of hydrogen molecule from Cr was calculated to be only 0.8 eV which is significantly lower than the other investigated sites. The Cr3+ with less coordinated oxygen enabled the metal site accessible to reactants and exemplified the reactivities of metal site. The reactivity of bridge oxygen at Cr3+ site was also explored as shown in Fig. 8 . Compared with OH site, the first hydrogen abstraction barrier was increased to 1.90 and 1.46 eV respectively for dissociated adsorption and radical pathway. For second hydrogen abstraction, Cr site again was involved CH bond activation. The hydrogen was attached to Cr site which lead to the bond breaking. The barriers were around 1 eV. The rest of pathway was similar to previous cases. It is noted that hydrogen molecule desorption was much facilitated at Cr site which is around 0.5 eV barrier. 3.5 Discussion From a detailed analysis of reaction pathway, the first interesting observation is that the most critical step is the regeneration of active site rather than CH bond activation regarding of barrier. In particularly for Cr6+ and Cr5+, the barrier of regeneration was up to 3 eV. In contrast, the barrier was reduced to be around 1 eV for Cr3+. The calculations also indicated the different reactivities of oxygen groups. It is found that terminal oxygen, OH group, and bridge oxygen have similar reactivity towards CH bond activation in propane. It was noted that OH group at Cr5+ and Cr3+ has comparable or even lower barrier for first CH bond activation compared with terminal oxygen on Cr6+. More interestingly, Cr3+ can directly participate into CH bond activation as shown in Fig. 7. Cr3+ can abstract hydrogen from C3H7 with similar activity with oxygen sites. This indicated the catalytic capabilities of metal site for propane activation. And the most active site was identified as Cr3+ regarding of calculated barriers as shown in Fig. 9 which was also supported from the literature survey [13–15], [34]. Moreover, OH group on support has moderate effect on catalytic performance. There were two different routes regarding of propane activation. One is the pathway involved with C3H7 radical and the other one is the dissociated adsorption of propane. The calculations indicated that the former mechanism is more favorable. Moreover, the catalytic performance from supported chromium oxide catalysts seem to be inferior to the reported Pt catalyst which is another conventional propane dehydrogenation catalyst [35,36]. 4 Conclusion In this work, a comprehensive DFT study was performed for the direct propane dehydrogenation on the supported chromium catalysts. Three different valences of chromium including 3, 5, and 6 are compared and the Cr3+ has relative better reactivity than the others. Two different pathways that C3H7 becomes either adsorbed on catalyst or radical in gas phase were evaluated at the same footing. The barrier calculations indicate that the C–H bond activation is not the rate-limiting step, and the product desorption is more challenging. The reacitivities of various oxygen groups are also compared. It is interesting to observe that OH group has comparable performance with terminal or bridge oxygens. Moreover, the intrinsic activity of Cr3+ is revealed which is capable to activate CH bond. Overall, the current study lay out a solid basis for the chromium catalyst in propane dehydrogenation and supply the unique insight on the reaction mechanism.

        "dc:description": "Chromium oxide is the conventional catalyst for propane direct dehydrogenation. However, the active site and reaction mechanism are still remaining unresolved due to the complicated valence of chromium and co-exists of several active sites. In this work, DFT calculations are performed to reveal the nature of active center and reaction mechanism for the supported chromium catalyst on silica. Three valences of chromium including Cr3+, Cr5+, and Cr6+ are examined to give a unbiased survey of reactivity. The reaction pathway and C–H activation are carefully examined. Moreover, a detailed analysis of active site regeneration is performed. The reactivities of different oxygen groups attached to Cr including terminal, bridge, and OH group are evaluated at the same footing. Furthermore, the calculations also reveal the intrinsic catalytic properties of chromium which show comparable abilities with oxygen groups. The influence from OH group on support is also evaluated. The comparisons of different reaction pathway give useful indication on the possible reaction mechanism. In the end, the most favorable active site is identified. The current work not only deepen the understanding of catalytic properties of supported chromium catalyst but also supply the doable optimization methods for further improvements.",
