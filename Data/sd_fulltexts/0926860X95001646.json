Stobbe-Kreemers *, M. Soede, M. Makkee, J.J.F. Scholten Department of Chemical Engineering, Delft University, of Technology Julianalaan 136,2628 BL Delft, The Netherlands Received 31 May 1995; accepted 1 July 1995 Abstract Heterogeneous Wacker oxidation catalysts, consisting of a palladium complex supported on a monolayer vanadium pentaoxide on y-alumina, have been tested in the oxidation of 1-butene to butanone. The steady-state activity of the catalysts is found to be 0.2 mmol butanone per tool Pd per second. The oxidation of l-butene over the heterogeneous catalysts runs analogously to the homo- geneous Wacker oxidation. The stability of the catalysts depends on the structure of the vanadium pentaoxide overlayer. Continuous reoxidation of Pdis possible only if the vanadium pentaoxide is present in a molecularly dispersed overlayer and does not proceed when crystalline vanadium pen- taoxide is used as a support. Temperature-programmed reduction measurements have shown that this is the result of the lower reducibility of the crystalline vanadium pentaoxide as compared to supported vanadium pentaoxide monolayers. The stability of the supported catalysts depends strongly on the vanadium pentaoxide coverage; due to sintering of the vanadium pentaoxide overlayer, a rapid deactivation is observed for catalysts with coverages below 1.5 V/nm2. Sintering is probably caused by the poor interaction of the partly reduced vanadium pentaoxide layer with y-alumina. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis revealed that under the reaction conditions 35% of the vanadium pentaoxide is present as V4and 50% of the palladium is present as Pd Keywords: Vanadium pentaoxide monolayer; y-Alumina; Wacker oxidation; 1-Butene; Deactivation I.

Stobbe-Kreemers et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 131 (1995) 36 ~381 mild conditions and is homogeneously catalyzed by palladium chloride dissolved in hydrochloric acid. During reaction Pd2 + is reduced and is regenerated in situ by the CuC12/CuC1 redox couple. The catalytic cycle can be described by the following three reactions: HzPdC14 + H20 + C2H4 ~ Pd+ CH3CHO + 4HC1 ( 1 ) Pd+ 2CuCl2 + 2HC1 ~ H2PdC14 + 2CuC1 (2) 2CuCl + 102 + 2HC1 ~ 2CuC12 + H20 (3) Combination of the three reactions gives the overall Wacker oxidation reaction: CH2=CH2+ 2 -~ CHa-CHO (4) Application of the Wacker process in the oxidation of higher alkenes, such as 1- butene, was also investigated [1,2]. It has, however, never been applied due to several technological drawbacks, such as the lower reaction rate for higher alkenes and the formation of more chlorinated byproducts. The problems encountered with the homogeneous oxidation of higher alkenes can be circumvented to a large extend by the application of a heterogeneous catalyst. Several attempts have been made to develop such a catalyst based on the H2PdC14-CuC12 system used in the homoge- neous process[3-6]. The best results, however, were obtained with catalysts in which the CuClz/CuC1 redox couple was replaced by vanadium pentaoxide [7- 11]. Scholten and co-workers [7-9] developed a heterogeneous catalyst, which con- sists of H2PdC14 deposited on a monolayer of vanadium pentaoxide supported on a high surface area support, such as y-alumina. Van der Heide showed that it is possible to oxidize ethene [8,9], as well as 1-butene [ 12] and styrene [ 13], over such catalysts under mild conditions and with high selectivity. The kinetics for ethene and 1-butene oxidation reported by Van der Heide resembles the well-known kinetics for homogeneous Wacker oxidation [ 14]. The rate equation is almost identical, with the exception that concentrations should be replaced by surface coverages: rate=k. OPdCI]-\" OH20\" OC2H4' ~CI o,, (5~ in which k is the rate constant and x is the reaction order in chloride, which varies between 1 and -2. The catalysts prepared by Van der Heide [8,9,12] suffer from deactivation, mainly due to loss of chloride. To circumvent deactivation, palladium chloride was deposited on the catalyst surface together with a large excess of hydrochloric acid. Impregnation with the strongly acidic H2PdCI4 solution, however, is detrimental to the texture of the catalyst; during impregnation the vanadium pentaoxide monolayer and part of the support dissolve, resulting in a dramatic change in the structure and texture of the catalysts. In some cases the BET surface area decreased from 250 to A.W. Stobbe-Kreemers et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 131 (1995) 367-381 369 60 m2/g as a result of the impregnation procedure. This problem can be partly overcome by applying other chloride sources, such as NaC1 or LiC1 instead of HC1. Another solution to this problem might be found in the application of other palladium compounds, such as palladium sulphate instead of palladium chloride. In this paper, the performance of palladium sulphate-based catalysts in the oxidation of 1-butene is discussed and compared with the performance of palladium chloride- based catalysts. The role of the vanadium pentaoxide monolayer in the reoxidation of palladium and in catalyst deactivation is investigated. Therefore, fresh and spent catalysts are characterized by means of temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). 2. Experimental A series of y-alumina-supported Wacker catalysts based on palladium sulphate was prepared. \"y-Al203 extrudates (Akzo, type 000-3P), BET surface area 269 m2/ g and pore volume 0.6 cm3/g, were used as a support material. The extrudates were crushed and sieved and the fraction between 400 and 625/~m was used for catalyst preparation. Vanadium pentaoxide was deposited by impregnation with an aqueous solution of NH4VO3 (from Merck, reagent grade, 10 g /dm3, pH = 4), as described elsewhere [ 15 ]. To obtain a series of catalysts with increasing vanadium pentaoxide loading contact times with the metavanadate solution were varied. Samples were dried at 350 K for 16 h and calcined at 675 K for 4 h in air. Following this procedure, vanadium pentaoxide is deposited as a monolayer on the y-alumina surface [ 15]. Subsequently, a palladium salt was deposited by impregnation to incipient wetness. Palladium sulphate and palladium chloride catalysts were prepared by impregnation with acidified aqueous solutions of PdSO4\" 2H20 (from Alfa Products) and PdC12 (from Johnson Matthey Chemicals), respectively. The acid concentrations were chosen so as to give a molar SO2-/Pd2+ or CI-/Pd2+ ratio of approximately 10. After impregnation, catalysts were dried and stored at 350 K in air. No decrease in BET surface area was observed as a result of impregnation with the acidic solutions of PdSO4 or HaPdC14 with acid concentrations up to 0.5 M (corresponding to a palladium coverage of 0.06 Pd/nm2). Impregnation with more acidic solutions resulted in a decreased BET surface area, as in the case of the catalysts prepared by van der Heide [8,9]. Although no decrease in BET surface area was observed, it is possible that (part of) the vanadium pentaoxide layer is affected by the acidic solution. For most catalysts the vanadium pentaoxide cov- erage is, however, larger than the sulphate or chloride coverage, viz. about 3 V/ nm2 and 0.4 SO42- or C1 - per nm2, respectively. This means that the larger part of the vanadium pentaoxide layer is not affected by the impregnation procedure. The catalysts were tested in the oxidation of 1-butene to butanone under differ- ential conditions (conversion per pass less than 10% ). Standard test conditions are 370 A. W.

Products were analyzed on-line with a gas chromatograph, equipped with a Pora- pack QS ( 120-150 mesh) column of 1 m length and 3 mm internal diameter and a flame ionization detector (FID). Activity was calculated as the rate of butanone production expressed in mol butanone produced per mol palladium per second. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was performed in a standard TPR apparatus, which has been described in detail elsewhere [ 15]. Approximately 100 mg of catalyst was heated at a rate of 0.17 K/s in a flow of 0.5 cm3(STP)/s of 66% hydrogen in argon. Hydrogen consumption was detected with a thermal con- ductivity detector (TCD). Water produced during reduction was removed by means of a molecular sieve trap. Samples containing palladium were cooled to about 223 K during the time required to stabilize the detector in order to prevent preliminary reduction of the catalyst. The sensitivity of the TCD for hydrogen was calibrated by means of reduction of CuO to Cu. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed with a PHI 5400 ESCA apparatus, in which Mg Ka radiation was used for sample excitation. Peak positions were determined by comparison with the A1 2p peak position to compensate for shifts due to charging of the samples. Fresh and spent catalysts were examined without further pretreatment. Scanning electron micrographs were taken using a Cambridge Stereoscan 150 scanning electron microscope, equipped with a X-ray micro analyzer (Link sys- tem). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Activity and stability Fig. 1 shows the activity of palladium sulphate-based catalysts in the oxidation of 1-butene to butanone, as compared with the activity of the palladium chloride- based catalyst developed by Van der Heide [ 8,9,12]. Both catalysts show an initial A.W.

Conditions as given in Table 1. increase in activity due to an increasing selectivity to butanone in the first hours of operation. After this initial increase, the activity of the palladium sulphate catalyst levels out at approximately 0.2 mmol butanone per mol palladium per second. The activity of the palladium chloride catalyst has a four times lower activity than the sulphate-based catalyst, as reported by Van der Heide [8,9]. In homogeneous Wacker oxidation a similar difference in activity is observed between catalysts based on palladium chloride and catalysts based on palladium salts with weakly complexing ligands, such as sulphate, nitrate or acetate [ 16]. The activity of these catalysts can be increased even further by the addition of small amounts of strong inorganic chloride-free acids, such as sulphuric, nitric or perchloric acid. The increased activity is believed to be the result of an increased electron affinity of the Pd2 + in the complex, when the strongly complexing C1- ligands are replaced by weakly complexing ligands [ 16]. The selectivity to butanone is more than 85%, and the major side products are acetic acid and acetaldehyde. Fig. 2 shows the activity of palladium sulphate-based catalysts as a function of time, with ( + ) and without (A) vanadium pentaoxide and clearly shows that the redox compound is necessary for the continuous production of butanone. The activity of the catalyst without vanadium pentaoxide, after an initial activity increase, rapidly declines and the production of butanone ceases after approximately 15 h. The total amount of butanone produced during this period corresponds to the stoichiometric reaction of 1-butene with Pd2 +, according to: Pd2+ +H20+CaH8 ~ PdCaH80+2H+ (6) Apparently, regeneration of Pd2 by dioxygen in the feed is not possible. Over the catalyst covered with a vanadium pentaoxide monolayer, in contrast, regeneration of Pd2 by the vanadium pentaoxide monolayer proceeds readily, since now buta- none is produced continuously. The catalyst based on non-supported V205, also depicted in Fig. 2, shows a fast deactivation. The total amount of butanone produced is comparable to the amount 372 A.W.

Apparently, crystalline vanadium pentaoxide is not suitable as a redox compound for the continuous reoxidation of Pd Evidently, the high dispersion, the structure and other typical chemical properties of supported vana- dium pentaoxide monolayers are essential for the rapid reoxidation of Pd This conclusion is supported by the results of Evnin et al. [ 10] and Forni and Gilardi [ 11 ], who also tried to apply vanadium pentaoxide as a redox compound in het- erogeneous Wacker oxidation. Their catalysts, prepared on a low-surface area o~- alumina, show rapid deactivation. It is known from the literature [ 17 ] that spreading of the vanadium pentaoxide into monolayers does not occur on ce-Al203 and that the vanadium pentaoxide is mainly present in the form of crystalline V205 particles. Hence the catalyst's activity is expected to resemble the activity of the palladium sulphate on bulk vanadium pentaoxide catalyst (see Fig. 2), which also shows a rapid deactivation. When dioxygen is removed from the feed, the activity of the catalyst covered with a vanadium pentaoxide monolayer also declines, as demonstrated in Fig. 3. 0.40 0.30 \\ 02 off \\ o,o + + ~ 4-+. 0.10 .~+++~+ +i~'~ +~-r ~;+ 0.00 i i a I i 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Time (h) Fig. 3.

Stobbe-Kreemers et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 131 (1995) 367-381 373 The total amount of butanone produced by the catalyst is, however, much larger than for the catalyst without vanadium pentaoxide, indicating that reoxidation of Pdby this oxide also proceeds in the absence of dioxygen. During this process the vanadium pentaoxide layer reduces, and 1-butene conversion ceases as soon as this process is completed [ 18]. Subsequent admittance of dioxygen to the feed leads to a revival of the activity. The behaviour of the catalysts (see Figs. 2 and 3) supports the idea that the oxidation of 1-butene proceeds analogously to the homogeneous process and can be described by the following three reactions: Pd2 + 4- C4H8 + H20 ~ Pd+ C4H80 4- 2H + Pd+ V2Os + 2H + --* Pd2 + 4- H2V205 HeV205 + I02 ~ V205 4- H20 (6') (7) (8) In Eqs. 7 and 8, for the sake of convenience, the stoichiometry of the surface vanadium bronze HxV205 is written with x = 2, but other stoichiometries are pos- sible as well [18]. Evidence that a surface analogue of the crystalline hydrogen bronze of vanadium oxide indeed exists is presented by Van der Heide et al. [ 18 ], who made a separate study of reaction steps (7) and (8). 3.2. Temperature-programmed reduction Reoxidation of Pd(reaction 7) results in the reduction of the vanadium pen- taoxide redox component. The differences in behaviour between catalysts based on monolayer vanadium pentaoxide and crystalline vanadium pentaoxide may find their origin in a difference in reducibilityThe reducibility of the supported and the non-supported vanadium pentaoxide catalysts was determined with TPR.

Profiles are normalized to 0.2 mmol vanadium atoms. 374 A. W. Stobbe-Kreemers et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 131 (1995) 367-381 Curve A in Fig. 4 shows that bulk vanadium pentaoxide is reduced between 700 and 900 K. The reduction of y-alumina-supported vanadium pentaoxide proceeds at lower temperatures, viz. between 600 and 800 K (see curve B in Fig. 4). Appar- ently, reduction of supported vanadium pentaoxide proceeds easier than that of non-supported vanadium pentaoxide. The change in the oxidation state of the vanadium atoms upon reduction was calculated from the peak areas of the profiles. In bulk vanadium pentaoxide the oxidation state of vanadium is found to decrease from V5 + to V3 +, whereas for the y-alumina-supported vanadium pentaoxide a decrease of V5 + to V35 + is calculated. The reduction of V5 + to V3 + for bulk V205 was also reported by Haber et al. [ 19,20] and by Nag and Massoth [21]. For the reduction of y-alumina-supported vanadium pentaoxide, however, they reported reduction of V5 + to V4 +. From gravimetric analysis they found that during reduction the samples lost 0.5 oxygen atom per vanadium. Upon reoxidation of the hydrogen reduced samples, however, Haber et al. [20] observed that the amount of oxygen necessary for complete reoxidation was 1.5 times the amount of oxygen released during the reduction. Therefore, they suggested that for each oxygen removed during the reduction of the vanadium pentaoxide layers one hydrogen atom remains bound to the reduced site: o/V\\o/V 0+312H2 o/V o/V\\o + H2o The incorporated hydrogen is difficult to detect in gravimetric analysis, but is readily detected with the thermal conductivity detector used in this study. The calculated average oxidation state of V35 + corresponds nicely with the hydrogen consumption in the reaction proposed by Haber et al. [ 19,20]. The profiles of the palladium sulphate impregnated samples in Fig. 4 (curves C and D) each show two reduction peaks, a low-temperature peak between 350 and 500 K and a high-temperature peak at approximately 650 K. The low-temperature reduction peaks represent the vanadium pentaoxide reduction, whereas the high- temperature peaks are due to the reduction of the impregnated sulphate, as can be seen from the reduction profile of palladium sulphate impregnated y-alumina (curve E in Fig. 4). Reduction of Pd2+ is not observed in the profiles because it already proceeds below room temperature and because the amount of palladium is very low. A strong decrease of the vanadium pentaoxide reduction temperature is observed for bulk V205 as well as for the y-alumina-supported vanadium pentaox- ide due to the presence of palladium sulphate; the temperature of maximum reduc- tion rate, Tin,x, is lowered by about 400 K for the bulk V205 sample and by circa 340 K for the y-alumina-supported sample. The lowest reduction temperature is again observed for the supported catalyst, indicating that, also in the presence of A. W. Stobbe-Kreemers et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 131 (1995) 367-38I 375 palladium, supported vanadium pentaoxide monolayers are more easily reduced than non-supported vanadium pentaoxide. The strong decrease in reduction temperature as a result of the catalytic action of palladium has been reported before for non-supported vanadium pentaoxide [ 22,23 ]. In the presence of palladium, reduction proceeds via a spillover mecha- nism, in which hydrogen is dissociatively chemisorbed at the palladium surface. The chemisorbed hydrogen atoms migrate over the palladium surface, spill over, and reduce the surrounding vanadium pentaoxide. Van der Heide [ 8,9,18 ] found that this spillover type of reduction also proceeds on supported vanadium pentaox- ide layers covered with a palladium salt. At temperatures as low as 373 K, reduction of the complete y-alumina-supported vanadium pentaoxide monolayer can be achieved and a hydrogen bronze of vanadium pentaoxide, HxV2Os, is reported to be formed, in which x varies between 0 and 3.8, depending on the temperature and the hydrogen pressure. For y-alumina-supported vanadium pentaoxide monolayers reduction resulted in the formation of H3V205 at 373 K [ 18]. 3.3. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy Looking at the reaction scheme (Eqs. 6-8) it is self-evident that the efficiency of the redox system not only depends on the rate of reduction of the vanadium pentaoxide monolayer but also on its rate of reoxidation ((Eq. 8). Fig. 3 shows that reaction in the absence of dioxygen leads to a gradual decrease in activity due to the accumulation of hydrogen in the vanadium pentaoxide layer. In the presence of dioxygen, continuous reoxidation of the surface hydrogen bronze occurs but not to completion, as can be deduced from the fact that, during use in 1-butene oxidation, the colour of the catalyst changes from brownish orange, characteristic of penta- valent vanadium, into dark green, typical of a lower valency. The fractions of oxidized and reduced vanadium in a used catalyst were deter- mined by means of XPS; the measured binding energies are characteristic of the vanadium valency and tend to decrease with decreasing oxidation state of the vanadium [21,24]. Fig. 5A shows the V 2p signal of a 0.9 wt.-% PdSO4, 14 wt.- % vanadium pentaoxide on y-alumina catalyst after it had been used for 24 h in the oxidation of 1-butene. The V 2pl/2 signal is shielded by the satellite peaks of oxygen and is, therefore, hardly detectable. Deconvolution of the V 2p3/2 peak reveals the presence of two types of vanadium, one characterized by a binding energy of 517.0 eV and the other by a BE of 515.6 eV. The signal at 517.0 eV is ascribed to Vs+ and the signal at 515.6 eV to V4+. The relative amounts of pentavalent and tetravalent vanadium were estimated from the areas of the two peaks. Approximately 65% of the vanadium is present in the fully oxidized V5 + state and about 35% in the V4+ oxidation state. V~ has not been observed in the XPS spectra, which suggests that the vanadium valency changes from 5 to 4 and back during the catalytic cycle and that reduction to V3 +, apparently, does not occur under the conditions of 1-butene oxidation. 376 A.

The Pd 3d5/2 signal at BE is 335.28 eV is ascribed to Pd whereas the second signal at 337.1 eV is ascribed to PdH [ 24]. Apparently, only 50% of the available palladium is still present in the active oxidized state. The considerable amount of Pdmay be the result of slow reoxidation by the vanadium pentaoxide monolayer and/or of sintering of the palladium into large metal particles. 3.4. Variation of the vanadium pentaoxide coverage Fig. 6 shows the activity of a series of catalysts as a function of the vanadium pentaoxide coverage.

Conditions as given in Table 1. and the steady state activities (after 15 h) are displayed. The major difference between the two curves is that the initial activity shows a steady decrease with increasing vanadium pentaoxide coverage, whereas the steady-state activity as a function of the vanadium pentaoxide coverage shows an optimum. The decrease of the initial activity with increasing vanadium pentaoxide coverage points to a gradual change of the intrinsic activity of the palladium sites, which should be related to a gradual change of the structure and reactivity of the vanadium pentaoxide layer. On the basis of low-energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEIS) experiments, a model of the structure of vanadium pentaoxide monolayers on 3,-alumina has been proposed elsewhere [ 15 ]. At low coverage, up to 1.5 V/nm2, vanadium pentaoxide is found to be mainly present as isolated monomeric and dimeric species on the 3,_ alumina surface. Above coverages corresponding to 1.5 V/nm2 a second layer is formed on top of these dimeric species, resulting in the formation of double-layered oligomeric species. Above 2.5 V/nm2 the oligomeric species grow into polymeric vanadium pentaoxide chains. The decrease in initial activity with increasing vanadium pentaoxide coverage points to a chemical interaction between the palladium complex and the vanadium pentaoxide. As Fig. 6 shows a decrease of the initial activity with increasing vana- dium pentaoxide coverage, sites on isolated monomeric or dimeric vanadium pen- taoxide species are, possibly, more active than sites on polymeric vanadium pentaoxide. The initial activity of the palladium sites, proposed to be bound to monomeric or dimeric vanadium pentaoxide species, was found to be high, but a strong decrease of the activity was observed in the first hours of operation and the final steady-state activity was much lower. On the other hand, the activity of oligomer-bound sites, being initially less active, remained almost the same after 15 h on stream, indicating that deactivation is less in this case. From these results it might be concluded that the activity of the sites decreases with increasing size of the vanadium pentaoxide species, whereas, in contrast, the stability increases. A.W.

Scanning electron microscopy The strong deactivation of catalysts with a low vanadium pentaoxide coverage ( < 1.5 V/nm2) was further investigated with scanning electron microscopy. Fig. 7 A.W. Stobbe-Kreemers et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 131 (1995) 367-381 379 shows SEM micrographs of fresh and spent catalysts. Vanadium pentaoxide appears to be homogeneously distributed over the surface in the fresh catalyst and no vanadium pentaoxide particles can be identified on the y-alumina surface (Fig. 7A). This supports the concept that a molecularly dispersed vanadium pen- taoxide layer is formed on the y-alumina surface. The micrograph of the spent catalyst (Fig. 7B), on the contrary, shows large particles (up to 10/xm in diameter) of vanadium pentaoxide indicating that the vanadium pentaoxide layer sintered under the conditions of 1-butene oxidation. The vanadium-line scan over the large particle in Fig. 7B shows that the particle is strongly enriched with vanadium compared to the surrounding surface. The sintering of the vanadium pentaoxide layer may be associated with its reduction in the catalytic cycle of 1-butene oxidation (reaction 7). Sintering of vanadium pentaoxide monolayers during reduction was also observed by Sobalik et al. [25]. Sobalik and co-workers also observed that, unlike for V205, V204 cannot be dispersed over the y-alumina surface by grinding and heating of a physical mixture of both compounds [26] and they concluded that this is due to the poor interaction of V204 with the y-alumina support. Sintering of reduced vanadium pentaoxide overlayers, as observed in the used Wacker catalysts, probably should be attributed to the poor interaction between the reduced vanadium pentaoxide and the y-alumina support. The strong deactivation of catalysts with a low vanadium pentaoxide coverage, as shown in Fig. 6, is most likely the result of the observed sintering of the vanadium pentaoxide layer. If this is true, the effect of sintering is evidently the largest for catalysts with the lowest vanadium pentaoxide coverage. Sintering not only results in an inhomogeneous distribution of vanadium pentaoxide and, hence, in a poor contact with the palladium complexes, but also in the lower activity, characteristic of palladium on a polymeric layer of vanadium pentaoxide. In catalysts with a higher vanadium pentaoxide coverage, vanadium pentaoxide is already present in polymeric form and the effect of sintering on the activity of the site will be smaller. Catalysts with intermediate vanadium pentaoxide coverage show a reasonable activity and also good stability. Apparently, oligomeric vanadium pentaoxide spe- cies possess a higher resistance against sintering than the monomeric and dimeric forms. 4. Conclusions PdSO4 deposited on a monolayer of vanadium pentaoxide on y-alumina forms an active heterogeneous Wacker catalyst. The oxidation of 1-butene over these catalysts runs analogously to the homogeneous Wacker oxidation. The structure and reactivity of the vanadium pentaoxide overlayer is very impor- tant for the stability of the catalyst. Regeneration of palladium is only possible with vanadium pentaoxide which is highly dispersed on a support, and not with crystal- 380 A.W. Stobbe-Kreemers et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 131 (1995) 367-381 line vanadium pentaoxide. The difference in performance is, among others, the result of the difference in reducibility of supported and crystalline vanadium pen- taoxide. TPR experiments show that in the presence of palladium sulphate reduction of y-alumina-supported vanadium pentaoxide monolayers proceeds at temperatures 80 K lower than the reduction of non-supported vanadium pentaoxide. The initial activity of the catalysts depends on the vanadium pentaoxide coverage and decreases with increasing coverage. Therefore, a chemical interaction between the palladium complex and the vanadium pentaoxide species is suggested. The activity of the palladium complex is directly influenced by the structure of the underlying vanadium pentaoxide and the highest activity is found for palladium on monomeric or dimeric vanadium pentaoxide species. Deactivation of the catalysts is found to depend strongly on the vanadium pen- taoxide coverage of the support and is largest for catalysts with coverages less than 1.5 V/nm2. SEM micrographs show that deactivation is caused by sintering of the vanadium pentaoxide overlayer. The sintering of the vanadium pentaoxide layer most probably proceeds as a result of the poor interaction of the reduced vanadium oxide layer with the y-alumina support. XPS measurements show that under reac- tion conditions 35% of the vanadium pentaoxide is in the reduced V4state and approximately 50% of the palladium is found to be present in the inactive reduced Pdstate.

Heterogeneous Wacker oxidation catalysts, consisting of a palladium complex supported on a monolayer vanadium pentaoxide on γ-alumina, have been tested in the oxidation of 1-butene to butanone. The steady-state activity of the catalysts is found to be 0.2 mmol butanone per mol Pd per second. The oxidation of 1-butene over the heterogeneous catalysts runs analogously to the homogeneous Wacker oxidation. The stability of the catalysts depends on the structure of the vanadium pentaoxide overlayer. Continuous reoxidation of Pd0 is possible only if the vanadium pentaoxide is present in a molecularly dispersed overlayer and does not proceed when crystalline vanadium pentaoxide is used as a support. Temperature-programmed reduction measurements have shown that this is the result of the lower reducibility of the crystalline vanadium pentaoxide as compared to supported vanadium pentaoxide monolayers. The stability of the supported catalysts depends strongly on the vanadium pentaoxide coverage; due to sintering of the vanadium pentaoxide overlayer, a rapid deactivation is observed for catalysts with coverages below 1.5 V/nm2. Sintering is probably caused by the poor interaction of the partly reduced vanadium pentaoxide layer with γ-alumina. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis revealed that under the reaction conditions 35% of the vanadium pentaoxide is present as V4+ and 50% of the palladium is present as Pd0.
