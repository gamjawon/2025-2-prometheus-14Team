Ph. Maetz, R. Touroude* Laboratoire d'Etudes de la Reactivite Catalytique, des Surfaces et Interfaces, U.R.A. 1498 du CNRS, Universite Louis Pasteur, 4 Rue Blaise Pascal, 67070 Strasbourg Cedex, France (Received January 7, 1994; accepted March 8, 1994) Abstract The hydrogenation of but- l-yne was studied on several platinum catalysts, supported on A1203 and S'Oz with varying dispersion and metallic weight. Both activity, calculated in terms of accessible platinum atoms, and selectivity to semi-hydrogenation were found to depend on the particle size. On highly dispersed catalysts, the turnover number and the selectivity were lower. The but- l-yne hydrogenation mechanism was studied using deuterium gas instead of hydrogen on the same catalysts. Using microwave spectroscopy for localisation of deuterium atoms in but-l-ene we found that, in addition to the cis addition of two deuterium atoms, 25% of the but-l-ene was produced by a different route which is a trans addition mechanism involving atomic and molecular deuterium. We also found that the isotopic dilution was greater for the formation of but-l-ene than for that of butane. The existence of two different types of catalytic sites on the catalyst surface is proposed: (i) The selective sites, which only lead to but-l-ene formation, are thought to be the faces of metal particles poisoned by reversible hydrocarbon deposits, in this case the reaction intermediates are vinylic adsorbed species. (ii) The non-selective sites, on which carbenes are formed and hydrogenated directly into butane, are largely accessible to hydrogen of the gas phase, they are considered to be localised on the edges and comers of metal particles. These non-selective sites are relatively more abundant on small metallic particles.

Introduction There have been many studies concerning hydrogenation of acetylenic compounds on Group VIII metals. Several different interpretations of the general pattern of selectivity have been proposed. The authors have put forward either the role of hydrogen-bound or the role of hydrocarbon-metal-bound intermediates, a definite understanding of these processes is not yet established. The hydrogenation of acetylenic compounds was firstly assumed to proceed by a consecutive process: the first hydrogenation step gives rise to an olefinic compound which is hydrogenated further into a saturated one. From an industrial point of view, it is interesting that the reaction stops after the first hydrogenation to improve the semihydrogenation selectivity. For this purpose, Pd metal catalysts are usually chosen. The first explanation why this metal is so selective was given by Bond [ 1 ] , and is based on thermodynamic factors. The high selectivity should be related to a high ratio of the heats of adsorption of acetylene and ethylene which has been shown by theoretical studies [ 2] . Therefore, small metallic particles, on which acetylenic compounds are more strongly adsorbed, should be more selective [ 3 ] . An alternative interpretation was based on the different forms of hydrogen which would be involved in various steps of the reaction. On Pd, Borodzinski et al. [4 ] claimed that hydride formation induces the non-selectivity, then the small Pd particles would be more selective because they absorb less hydrogen than large particles. However, this assertion was not further confirmed and some doubts could exist arising from X-ray assignments showing the coexistence of Pd hydride and Pd carbide phases [ 5 ] which was not taken into account at the time [ 6] . On the other hand, Wells [ 7 ] has related the selectivity of platinum metal elements, other than Pd, to the extent of occluded hydrogen and proposed that cavitated zones with occluded hydrogen coexist with highly ordered zones of powdered metals, leading to saturated hydrocarbons and olefins, respectively. In these latter propositions it is assumed that two parallel pathways are involved in the hydrogenation of the alkyne (or alkadiene) into the alkene and alkane. The same suggestions were made by other authors [ 8-10] , considering that different hydrocarbon-metal complex intermediates are formed in reaction steps 1 and 3 of the parallel scheme represented below. RC-CR- RHC=CHR2 10 RHZC-CHZR 3 Since adsorbed acetylene was shown to exist on palladium as an ethylidyne species [ 1114], it was proposed that these species were involved in the direct hydrogenation route [ 9,15 ] . The deuterium tracer studies performed for alkyne or alkadiene hydrogenation on palladium supported this assertion [ 10,16 ] . A1 Ammar and Webb [ 17 ] have proposed that a carbonaceous layer formed on the catalyst is the active phase for the hydrogenation reaction. Godbey et al [ 18] assigned this role of \"co-catalyst\" to the ethylidyne layer. However, Beebe and Yates [ 13] have demonstrated by IR studies that ethylidyne is only a \"spectator species\" and plays no role in ethylene hydrogenation. If the role of the ethylidyne species is still controversial in the Ph. Maetz, R. Touroude /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 259-275 261 hydrogenation reaction, their existence is now well established, and the corresponding species for C3 and CQ have also been observed on platinum [ 19 ] . More recently, Den Hartog et al. [ 20] proposed that, for acetylene hydrogenation, Group VIII metals could be subdivided into two parts: on Ir or Rh, ethane would be formed by direct hydrogenation of ethylidene and ethylidyne, whereas on Pt or Pd the effect of deposition of carbonaceous layers would prevail leading to a selective catalyst. In previous work [ 21 ] we have presented direct evidence of the presence of a hydrocarbon deposit on Pt/A1203 catalyst which plays an important role in determining the semi-hydrogenation selectivity of but-1-yne. The most striking feature in this study was the complete reversibility of this layer under the conditions of the reaction. Moreover, it has been shown that the build-up of this reversible hydrocarbon deposit is greatly dependent on the experimental conditions [ 22] . These conclusions were supported by IR analysis, performed during the reaction, in the case of Pt/Si02 catalysts [22]. It was concluded that the deposit is in equilibrium with the reactive species and it was assumed that all adsorbed species, on the metal as well as on the support, are in equilibrium with the virtual, but not actual pressure of hydrocarbon [ 22 ] . In the present work we focus our attention on the study of steady-state butyne hydrogenation on Pt catalysts when a stable and high selectivity is obtained. We attempt to define more precisely which factors govern the selectivity during the stationary phase. For this purpose platinum catalysts with different dispersions were used to examine the effect of particle size on the nature of the adsorbed species. To examine further the hydrogenation mechanism, we have also studied the deuteration of but- l-yne using microwave analysis to determine precisely the position of deuterium tracer atoms in the reaction products. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts The Pt/A1203 catalysts, named PtA, PtB, were prepared and characterized at the Institut Francais du Petrole, Rueil-Malmaison, as described elsewhere [ 3 ] . Platinum acetylacetonate was used as precursor. Pt, and PtII samples were prepared by wet impregnation of silica (Degussa Aerosil 200) by an aqueous solution of HZPtC16 (Johnson Matthey, pro analysis, > 99%). These samples were oven dried at 393 K during 12 h, and reduced under hydrogen flow at 673 K for 2 h. PtuI was prepared on a silica (Cab-O-Sil, surface area 200 m'/g) by impregnation using the incipient wetness technique. The catalyst was vacuum dried at room temperature prior to reduction in flowing hydrogen for 2 h at 723 K. EUROPT-1 catalyst is a Pt/ Si02 catalyst prepared from HZPtC16. The preparation and characterisation are described elsewhere [ 23 ] . Contents of metal and dispersion values of various catalysts are given in Table 1. 2.2. Catalytic reaction. Before each catalytic experiment, the catalyst was activated under Hz (DZ) flow at atmospheric pressure, 573 K, for 1 h. 262 Ph. Maetz, R.

Fig. 1. But-l-yne conversion ( + ) and But-l-ene selectivity ( X ) as a function of time on PtA catalyst (hydrogen pressure: 38 Tort, hydrocarbon pressure: 14 Tort, reaction temperature: 273 K). But-l-yne (Air Liquide, 95% purity) was purified from its acetylene impurity just before each run by distillation at low temperature ( <210 K). HZ (DZ) or 5-95% H2 (132) -He mixture (Air Liquide) were used after purification by passing through a Pt/A1203 catalyst heated at 453 K followed by a trap at 196 K. The catalytic reaction was carried out in a glass flow system including a reactor operating at atmospheric pressure. After catalyst activation and cooling to the reaction temperature, 255 K, a known quantity of but-l-yne, at constant hydrocarbon pressure (14 Ton), was passed over the catalyst in a HZ (Dz), or 5-95% HZ (D2)-He mixture, flow. Two catharometers were inserted upstream and downstream with respect to the reactor, their signals representing the hydrocarbon pressure as a function of time. The hydrocarbon flow rate could therefore be calculated. Small amounts of the reaction products were drawn off the line after the reactor at different times during the catalytic run and analysed by gas-liquid Ph. Maetz, R. Touroude /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 259-275 263 chromatography (GLC) using a 2.5 m, 3.175 10-3 m O.D. dimethyl sulfolane column operating at 293 K with a flame ionization detector. When deuterium was used in the experiments, each hydrocarbon was separated by GLC and further analyzed by mass spectrometry (using a Type CH7 Varian spectrometer) and in some cases, by microwave spectroscopy (using a 33.33 kHz Hewlett-Packard microwave spectrometer on which a computer with a home made data acquisition program was added, greatly improving the reliability of the small signals). Otherwise the analysis procedures are as described in detail elsewhere [24]. The notation of the different deuterated but- 1enes is listed in Scheme 1.

Deuterium distribution in but- l-ene (microwave analysis). In this reaction, the but-l-ene selectivity (S) was defined as the but-l-ene to but-1ene+butane ratio; the but-2-enes were not detected. Fig. 1 shows the characteristic development of the conversion (Cu) and the but- l-ene selectivity as a function of time during one experiment where the contact time of the hydrocarbon on the catalyst is kept constant. The stationary phase is defined when the selectivity reaches the highest value. However, the conversion could decrease slightly with time during this stationary phase. Therefore, for comparison between all the catalysts, the conversion, taken into account to calculate the rate of hydrogenation ( Cv - Fl to, F: butyne flow rate, ce: weight of catalyst) was determined using the values obtained after the same number of molecules had passed over the catalysts. For this, curves similar to Fig. 1 were drawn, but where the conversion was plotted as a function of the number of molecules passed through the reactor (hydrocarbon flow multiplied by time-on-stream); Cu was thus determined after 360 jmol were passed over the catalysts. 264 Ph. Maetz, R. Touroude /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 259-275 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Reactivity study Whatever the support, we observed an increase in the activity with increasing particle size (Table 1). In the case of Pt/A1203 catalysts, the activity on large particles was 2.8 times greater than on small particles. For Pt/Si02 catalysts, when the dispersion was divided by a factor of 4, the activity increased 2.6 times. These ratios are similar with those previously obtained on Pd catalysts, for dispersion varying from 26 to 97% [ 25 ] . For similar dispersions, the activity was higher on Pt/Si02 than on the Pt/A1203 catalysts: TON values were found to be 2.2 s-' on Pt/Si02 compared to 0.94 s-' on Pt/A1203 for 40% dispersed catalysts. We have found that the reaction order was negative with respect to the but- l-yne partial pressure as is usually found for such a reaction [ 25-27 ] . By varying the total flow rate it was possible to study the variation of the but-l-ene selectivity as a function of the conversion. The results are given in Fig. 2 where the selectivity is plotted as a function of the total conversion, for PtA, PtB, Pt, and Pt,I. The selectivity 100 oa 40 zo 0 1 .

Ph. Maetz, R. Touroude /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 259-275 265 remains high up to a limit conversion, a,, after which it drops dramatically. The same trends were observed on Pd/A1203 catalysts, however, while a, on Pd was found to depend largely on the catalyst dispersion [ 25 ] , on Pt, a, was only slightly lower on small particles (80% ) than on larger particles (90%). The selectivities observed when the conversion is lower than a,, are reported in Table 1, the following can be noted: (i) The selectivity can be seen to increase with increasing particle size, whatever the support used. (ii) For similar dispersions, the selectivity is lower for Pt1Si02 catalysts than for Pt/ A1203 catalysts. In the temperature range 255-298 K, the selectivity was found to be independent of temperature. A decrease in the activity of highly dispersed catalysts has already been reported in the hydrogenation reaction of alkyne or diene compounds, whatever the metal or the support used. In the case of butadiene hydrogenation single crystal studies have shown that the reaction is structure sensitive. In the case of platinum [ 28 ] or palladium [ 29 ] , (111) faces have been found to be less active than (110) or (100) faces. For polycrystalline particles, the structure of the particle surface varies with the particle size. By theoretical studies, for a fcc model particle, Marks [ 30] has determined that, as the particle size decreases, the proportion of (100) faces shows a marked decrease. Also, according to Dreschler [ 31 ] , for a particle size of 20 A, only (111) or (002) faces can exist. So, the small particles would have principally (111) faces, due to the fact that they are more compact. For Pd on alumina catalysts, Binet et al. [32] have determined the proportion of (111) and (100) faces, by studying CO adsorption using infrared. They observed an important decrease in the (111) face proportion, for dispersion below 20%. Similarly, for small particles, Palazov et al. [ 33 ] , indicate the following proportions for the different faces: (111) 70%, (100) 25% and (110) 5%. The decrease in the activity, observed when the dispersion increases, could therefore be due to the higher proportion of (111) faces on small particles. On (111) faces, unsaturated hydrocarbons are preferentially adsorbed as alkylidyne species due to the favourable geometric structure. The formation of such species has been observed on single crystals [ 34 ] , as well as on supported catalysts [ 14 ] , and characterized by spectroscopic studies [ 19]. It has been shown that these species are hydrogenated, but with a very slow rate with respect to aT or di-Q adsorbed species [ 13 ] . These alkylidyne species could lead to the direct hydrogenation of the alkyne to the alkane, as proposed in the case of acetylene hydrogenation. In the case of but- l-yne hydrogenation, the butylidyne species formation could be favoured on small particles compared to large particles because of the higher proportion of (111) faces. It is worth noting that EUROPT-1, which should consist principally of (111) faces [ 35 ] , was found to be the least active and least selective catalyst among the silica supported Pt catalysts. However, further insight into the catalyst sites will be given after the presentation of the deuterium tracer studies. The differences observed in the reactivities of the Pt1Si02 and Pt/A1203 catalysts will not be discussed in this paper since more experiments are needed to define clearly the influence of the precursor compound and/or the nature of the support. 266 Ph. Maetz, R. Touroude /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 259-275 3.2. Deuterium tracer studies Tracer studies using deuterium instead of hydrogen were performed on each catalyst. The influence of the deuterium pressure and of the reaction temperature were also investigated, however, no temperature effect was found in our experiments in the range 255-298 K. Since we obtained similar results for each catalyst, we shall focus our attention on the results obtained on catalysts PtA and PtB. The deuterium distributions in but- l-ene and butane are reported for but- l-yne deuteration performed at 38 Torr (Table 2 a, b) and 760 Torr (Table 2c) for Pt/A1203 catalysts. The reactant, but-1-yne, showed almost no H,D exchange ( < 1%). The percentages of the various deuterated species obtained from microwave analysis are shown in Scheme 1. These molecules were considered as initial products of the reaction, i.e., as molecules desorbed after a single adsorption step. There are two main results which permit us to affirm this point. First, in the 10-50% conversion range, the same proportions of the different molecules were observed by both mass spectrometry or microwave analyses. Second, when but- l-ene, produced by but- l-yne deuteration, was used as reactant for the further deuteration reaction, the mass distribution of butane was different with respect to the distribution obtained in the case of butane coming from but- l-yne deuteration [36]. The deuterium distributions were recalculated and fitted to experimental ones using the statistical procedure introduced by Meyer and Burwell [37]. In this approach, it was proposed that a pool of hydrogen (H) and deuterium (D) atoms exist on the surface and an adsorbed but- l-yne species, either associatively and/or dissociatively, can pick up 2 or 3 H or D atoms to give do-, d,-, dZ- and d3-but- l-ene.

Addition-multiple exchange processes N; (i > 3) have to be considered to take into account the molecules which contain more than 3 deuterium atoms. The same approach was used to recalculate the butane distribution. In this case NQ 268 Ph. Maetz, R. Touroude /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 259-275 is the addition process, NS the addition-simple exchange process and Ni (i > 5) the additionmultiple exchange process. The H, D pool on the surface is not in equilibrium with the gas phase, since large amounts of hydrogen atoms are incorporated into the hydrocarbon molecules, whereas very few HD molecules were found in the gas phase. This isotopic dilution on the surface can have one of two origins: (i) acetylenic hydrogen exchange, and even some multiple exchange processes, (ii) reversible and/or irreversible hydrocarbon deposit. With a deuterium pressure of 38 Torr, N2 is about 85%, N3 is about 15% with a D/H ratio 5.8 1 for butene distribution. N4 and NS values, for the butane distribution, are respectively 62% and 30% with D/H ratio equal to 10 t 1. It is noted that the D/H ratio was found to be twice as high in the butane than in the but- l-ene distribution and the ratio N4/NS in the butane distribution was lower than N2/N3 in the but- l-ene distribution. When the reaction was performed at deuterium atmospheric pressure on catalyst Pt., some striking features appear. For the but-l-ene distribution, the d3 contribution is lower than the corresponding one obtained at 38 Torr; N2, N3 being respectively 91% and 9% with D/H equal to 9. In parallel, for butane distribution, d5 together with d,-dto are also lower than the corresponding ones obtained at 38 Torr; N4, NS being respectively 79% and 18% with D/H equal to 30. At atmospheric pressure, the ratios N2/N3 for butene and N4/ NS for butane remain different but both are larger than that obtained under low pressure. The D/H ratios and the difference between the butane D/H ratio and the but-l-ene D/H ratio are also greater. Moreover, we have found some differences in the hyperfine deuterium distributions, for the localisation of deuterium atoms in the but-l-ene molecules (Scheme 1): trans addition (1b-M2, lbdl) increases slightly while that of the dideuterated species on Cl ( la-1bd2) dramatically falls. All these differences between the results under 38 and 760 Torr of DZ are summarized in Fig. 3, providing clear evidence that the reaction mechanism is deuterium pressure dependent. During butene formation, a greater number of hydrogen atoms than that released by exchange were introduced: d, > d3, Xid,/ 100 < 2, D/H low (see Table 2).

Distributions of deuterated products: effects of deuterium pressure on various deuterated species ratios (catalyst Pta). Ph. Maetz, R. Touroude /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 259-275 269 indicate that the hydrocarbon deposit could play a role in the reaction mechanism by donating hydrogen atoms. Differently in butane, d5 is higher than d3, 'idi/ 100 is higher than 4 and D/H is high. Thus butane formation certainly does not occur on the same catalytic site as but- l-ene formation. 3.2.1. Mechanism of butene formation Meyer and Burwell [ 37 ] proposed a cis addition mechanism of two D or H atoms to the C---C bond, in order to explain both NZ and N3 processes. In this case, the N3 process is a cis addition of 2 H,D atoms occurring on a molecule which has previously exchanged its acetylenic hydrogen. However, as indicated in [ 10] , such a mechanism does not explain the excess of lb-2d2 species compared to the la-1bd2 species. In order to explain this excess an additional pathway must be found; this additional reaction is in fact a trans addition. Hub and Touroude [ 10], working on Pd at low Dz pressure, have introduced a single scheme which involves olefins, carbenes and carbynes as adsorbed species. The carbene and carbyne species lead to a trans addition mechanism and direct hydrogenation into butane. In the reaction scheme, the N3 mechanism takes place via a secondary carbene which permits the exchange of the acetylenic hydrogen and gives rise to lb-2d2, la-1bd2, and d3 species in a single mechanism, as shown in the following scheme (Scheme 2). H X ~ R XZHC R XZC R X ` ,R HC t CR --~ +X * +X * -H (X) * +X X X X-HorD Scheme 2. The relative proportions of lb-2d2, la-1bd2, and d3 species were well reproduced by a statistical calculation using the N3 mechanism, and taking into account the calculated D/H pool and an isotopic effect in CH/CD rupture. In our case, particularly in the 760 Torr D2 experiment, in which the D/H ratio is high and d3 is small, it is impossible to fit the experimental values using this single N3 mechanism since lb-2d2 is too large compared to d3. It is important to note that this difference is much more visible at 760 Torr than at 38 Torr. In [ 10] the results could be explained using a single pathway because of the low working pressure. At 760 Torr, D2 on bulk intermetallic Pd catalysts [ 38 ] exhibits the same pressure effects as for Pt catalysts. The two mechanisms detailed above do not explain the distribution of deuterium in the butene. This is principally due to the excess of 1 b-2d2 species with respect to la-lbdz species and d3 species. To explain the excess of lb-2d2 species, another trans addition mechanism must be proposed. A reaction involving surface steps was rejected because there was no difference 270 Ph. Maetz, R. Touroude /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 259-275 in the transl cis addition ratio when the catalyst dispersion was changed. On the other hand, our results show clearly that hydrocarbon deposit and hydrogen (deuterium) pressure play an important role in the hydrogenation mechanism. We now introduce a reaction mechanism in which the hydrocarbon deposit, through the formation of two different types of catalytic site, and the deuterium pressure are involved (Scheme 3) .

Mechanism of but- l-ene formation. The but-l-yne adsorbs associatively on the catalyst. Then, the but-l-yne can react with a chemisorbed hydrogen (or deuterium) atom to form an olefinic intermediate adsorbed in a vinylic position. This intermediate can then desorb by a cis addition of another hydrogen (or deuterium) to form the but- l-ene (\"NZ\" mechanism). This will lead to the formation of la-2d2 species, and due to the isotopic dilution, lad, and 2dt species. Therefore, this is the main route of the overall process, since la-2d2 species are the most important species obtained. Ph. Maetz, R. Touroude /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 259-275 271 By a second route, but- l-yne can react with a weakly bonded DZ molecule (Eley-Rideal mechanism), as has already been proposed for benzene hydrogenation [ 39,40] . In this case, the deuterium atom can only be added in a trans position, leading to an olefin adsorbed in a vinylic position by the secondary carbon (species A). The secondary vinylic carbon adsorbed species can desorb by addition of a second atom of hydrogen (deuterium) to form but-l-ene (\"NZ\" trans addition mechanism) leading to lb-2d2 and lbdl species. This intermediate can be dehydrogenated to give a di-o- adsorbed species (species B). In this way the N3 mechanism will be obtained leading to d3, la-lbd2 and additional amounts of la ( lb)-2d2 species. For d3 and la-1bd2 species, this latter mechanism is the only route of formation, and the difference in the pathway is the addition of one H atom for la-lbd2 instead of one D atom for d3. Therefore, the ratio between these two species should be equal to the D/H ratio. In the case of Pt,, the ratios d3/ la- 1bd2 are equal to 7.3 and 4 respectively at low (Table 2b) and high (Table 2c) DZ pressures which are in good agreement with 8.7 and 5.2 given for D/H ratios at low and high DZ pressures, respectively. The cis addition route leads to the formation of la-2d2, lad,, 2d, and do but-l-ene species; d3, lb-2d2, la-1bd2 and lbd, species are produced via the trans addition route. In the case of PtB, this leads us to the following proportions for the two routes DZ pressure Addition (%) (Torn) cis trans Pte 760 74.6 25.4 Pte 38 75.5 24.5 The trans addition route is not enhanced by an increase in deuterium pressure. However, it is known that an increase in deuterium pressure favours the desorption of adsorbed species with respect to the interconversions between mono and di adsorbed species as shown in the comparison of simple and multiple exchanges in saturated hydrocarbon exchange [41,42], or hydrogenation and exchange in olefin-deuterium contact reactions [43]. In our case, at low deuterium pressure, the dehydrogenation of the vinyl adsorbed species (species A, Scheme 3) , obtained by the trans addition route, into the di-Q species (species B, Scheme 3) should be enhanced. Thus, the proportion of di-Q species should be greater, and therefore the contribution of N3 mechanism should be enhanced, as observed in our results at low deuterium pressure. Conversely, when deuterium pressure is high, the adsorption of A will be favoured leading to lb-2d2 or lbd, but-l-ene. At atmospheric deuterium pressure, we have found, by microwave analysis, an increase in the proportion lbd, species, however lb-2d2 was not significantly affected. 3.2.2. Butane formation mechanism The comparison of butene and butane distributions and the further statistical calculations, as described above, lead us to introduce a different type of site, and different intermediates for butane formation to those involved in olefin hydrogenation. In addition to mono-o- and di-o, alkyl species which are involved in the butene to butane hydrogenation pathway, carbene species can be invoked as possible reaction intermediates (Scheme 4). 272 Ph.

C Butane NS Scheme 4. Mechanism of butane formation. In fact, the initiation of carbenes during an acetylenic hydrogenation process is a direct route involving the transformation of a cr vinylic to a carbene species by addition of one deuterium or hydrogen atom on the ss carbon. This could be considered as a concerted mechanism occurring on a single metal atom. Afterwards, the total hydrogenation of this carbene leads to butane (N4 mechanism). The N5 mechanism, during which the acetylenic hydrogen is exchanged, would .involve either an additional interconversion between the secondary carbene and its vinylic precursor (step 3, Scheme 4), or an additional dehydrogenation step of primary carbene into carbyne. The NS mechanism requiring a series of consecutive steps on the surface is unfavoured compared to N4 mechanism, by an increase of deuterium pressure as is actually observed. It has been demonstrated in the previous section that carbene intermediates are not involved in the butene formation mechanism which takes place on poisoned sites, to which the DZ (HZ) gas has limited accessibility. Conversely the butane mechanism occurs on sites which are easily accessible to DZ (HZ) gas, since a high D/H value was found when fitting the deuterium butane distribution. These \"non-selective sites\" could be localized on the edges or corners of the metal particles while \"selective sites\" would be on the faces largely blocked by the reversible hydrocarbon deposits. The small particles which contain a larger Ph. Maetz, R. Touroude /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 259-275 273 number of edge and corner atoms, relative to the total atom number, are expected to be less selective than the larger ones. This latter proposition is actually observed. However, the peculiar morphology of small particles in which a larger number of (111) faces would lead to higher amounts of carbyne species as suggested in the first part of this paper, is not demonstrated by our deuterium tracer experiments. The NS1NQ ratios, which could be a relative measure of carbyne/carbene intermediates formed on various catalysts, change neither with metal particle size, nor with nature of metal. On Pd and Ru, metal catalysts which show, relatively to Pt, a high ( > 95%) [ 10] and low (35%) [44] semihydrogenation selectivity, the NS/N4 ratios were similar [10,36]. Since the variation in semi-hydrogenation selectivity does not lead to N5/N4 variations in deuterium butane distributions, we think that the ability of the metal to form the carbyne cannot be considered as a key factor in the determination of the semi-hydrogenation selectivity of a catalyst. 4. Conclusion It is clear that, for the hydrogenation of acetylenic compounds, the active sites are metallic sites, the geometric and electronic properties of which are modified by hydrocarbon deposits. When the catalyst operates as a so-called selective catalyst, the following points arise: (i) Particle size effects: small particles are less active and less selective than larger ones. (ii) The existence of two types of catalytic site: deuterium tracer studies show that the isotopic dilution is greater for but- l-ene formation than for butane, and acetylenic hydrogen is more exchangeable in the formation steps of butane than in those of but- l-ene. On catalytic sites leading to but- l-ene formation, the hydrogen atoms, coming from the hydrocarbon deposits, participate in the reaction. But- l-ene is mainly produced (75%) by the cis addition of two deuterium (hydrogen) atoms, 25% of the but- l-ene is produced by a different route, i.e. a trans addition mechanism involving atomic and molecular deuterium (hydrogen). This second route could explain the formation of trans-d2-but-l-ene, and also acetylenic hydrogen exchange. Butane is formed through carbene and probably carbyne intermediates which are directly hydrogenated. The build-up of hydrocarbon deposit, described elsewhere [22] leads to the formation of selective sites, with respect to non-selective sites. Selective sites, which lead only to but- l-ene formation, arise when metal particles are poisoned by hydrocarbon deposits, formed by adsorbed but- l-yne, and in equilibrium with the virtual pressure of but- l-yne [22]. The catalytic sites are isolated metallic sites, which are less accessible to hydrogen adsorption from the gas phase. On these sites, 7r-adsorbed but-1-yne is transformed selectively into vinylic adsorbed species, these reactive species desorb as but- l-ene. The carbonaceous layer blocks a large part of the metallic area, and can change the electronic properties of metal, inhibiting further evolution of the vinylic adsorbed species to further hydrogenated species, carbenes or cr-alkyl. Thus, butane cannot be formed on these sites. Non-selective sites are more accessible to hydrogen from the gas phase. They could be localised on edges and corners of metal particles, and are able to form carbene species and hydrogenate directly to butane. This study shows that a reactive catalytic surface is a complex system in which hydro- 274 Ph. Maetz, R. Touroude /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 259-275 carbon deposits, reactive hydrocarbon-metal and hydrogen-metal complex intermediates associate with each other.

Touroude ∗ Laboratoire d'Etudes de la Réactivité Catalytique, des Surfaces et Interfaces, U.R.A. 1498 du CNRS, Université Louis Pasteur, 4 Rue Blaise Pascal, 67070 Strasbourg Cedex, France * Corresponding author. The hydrogenation of but-1-yne was studied on several platinum catalysts, supported on Al2O3 and SiO2 with varying dispersion and metallic weight. Both activity, calculated in terms of accessible platinum atoms, and selectivity to semi-hydrogenation were found to depend on the particle size. On highly dispersed catalysts, the turnover number and the selectivity were lower. The but-1-yne hydrogenation mechanism was studied using deuterium gas instead of hydrogen on the same catalysts. Using microwave spectroscopy for localisation of deuterium atoms in but-1-ene we found that, in addition to the cis addition of two deuterium atoms, 25% of the but-1-ene was produced by a different route which is a trans addition mechanism involving atomic and molecular deuterium. We also found that the isotopic dilution was greater for the formation of but-1-ene than for that of butane. The existence of two different types of catalytic sites on the catalyst surface is proposed: (i) The selective sites, which only lead to but-1-ene formation, are thought to be the faces of metal particles poisoned by reversible hydrocarbon deposits, in this case the reaction intermediates are vinylic adsorbed species. (ii) The non-selective sites, on which carbenes are formed and hydrogenated directly into butane, are largely accessible to hydrogen of the gas phase, they are considered to be localised on the edges and corners of metal particles. These non-selective sites are relatively more abundant on small metallic particles.

        "dc:description": "The hydrogenation of but-1-yne was studied on several platinum catalysts, supported on Al2O3 and SiO2 with varying dispersion and metallic weight. Both activity, calculated in terms of accessible platinum atoms, and selectivity to semi-hydrogenation were found to depend on the particle size. On highly dispersed catalysts, the turnover number and the selectivity were lower. The but-1-yne hydrogenation mechanism was studied using deuterium gas instead of hydrogen on the same catalysts. Using microwave spectroscopy for localisation of deuterium atoms in but-1-ene we found that, in addition to the cis addition of two deuterium atoms, 25% of the but-1-ene was produced by a different route which is a trans addition mechanism involving atomic and molecular deuterium. We also found that the isotopic dilution was greater for the formation of but-1-ene than for that of butane. The existence of two different types of catalytic sites on the catalyst surface is proposed: (i) The selective sites, which only lead to but-1-ene formation, are thought to be the faces of metal particles poisoned by reversible hydrocarbon deposits, in this case the reaction intermediates are vinylic adsorbed species. (ii) The non-selective sites, on which carbenes are formed and hydrogenated directly into butane, are largely accessible to hydrogen of the gas phase, they are considered to be localised on the edges and corners of metal particles. These non-selective sites are relatively more abundant on small metallic particles.",
