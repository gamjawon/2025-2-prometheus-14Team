Graphical abstract An efficient methodology was established for the preparation of alkyl/aryl mixed phosphates under aerobic conditions promoted by a easily recoverable heterogeneous catalyst. This highly active copper catalyst was obtained by directly mixing of copper precursor with chitosan solution, followed by a simple work-up process. In this catalytic system, different phosphoryl azides and aliphatic alcohols were employed to generate desired products in moderate to excellent yields with good functional group tolerance. This protocol provided a practical application of the chitosan supported heterogeneous copper catalyst towards a novel PO bond formation. Keywords Copper catalysis Chitosan supported catalyst Phosphoryl azide Aliphatic alcohol Alkyl/aryl mixed phosphate Esterification 1 Introduction It has been recognized that phosphorus related organic compounds are prominent motifs in biological systems and business applications [1]. In the past decades, much efforts have been continuously devoted not only to the basic research but also to the science and technology achievements’ transformation. The introduction of phosphorus motifs to the parent structures could provide diversified bonding properties and polarization, hence their chemical and physical properties would be substantially changed. Alkyl/aryl mixed phosphates, in particular, are very important (sub)structures in fungicides, non-halogenated flame retardants, pesticides, as well as pro-drugs [2], and several known compounds exhibit bio-active characteristics [3]. However, these compounds are very costly because they are rear in the nature. As a consequence, in the last years several methodologies have been accomplished to synthesis alkyl/aryl mixed phosphates [4–8]. A number of phosphorus containing compounds such as phosphorus chloride [4], diphenyl phosphate [5], diphenyl phosphite [6], mixed phosphite [7], as well as other substrates [8] were employed as starting materials for the desired product preparation via different mechanisms. In the aforementioned transformations, some of phosphoric motifs, reactants, as well as reagents are usually unstable, expensive, hard to fabricate in large scale, or even corrosive. Furthermore, most of these transformations required harsh conditions with excess amount of additives, which essentially limit their synthetic applications. Very recently, our group have established a homogeneous catalytic protocol to prepare desired alkyl/aryl mixed phosphates [9], in which diphenylphosphoryl azide (DPPA) [10] was introduced as a novel and reactive phosphoric reagent for the very first time. Although the high chemical yield was achieved, the catalyst recyclability and the possible trace mount of metal contaminant with product also restrict its application. Hence, we are inspired to explore a highly efficient heterogeneous catalytic system for this transformation. In the past decades, heterogeneous catalysis with supported transition metals as active centers has become a prevailing fashion to realize many organic transformations [11]. Importantly, compared with homogeneous catalysis, it exhibits several advantages such as recoverable, recyclability, and easily product separation, providing superior platforms in the catalysis community. To achieve this goal, different supports such as silica, polymers, carbon-based materials, zeolites etc have been successively developed to immobilize the active species [12]. Among these achievements, polymers especially biopolymers are considered as environmentally friendly materials and have been widely used in heterogeneous catalysis [13]. One of the most outstanding examples is chitosan (CS), which can be easily obtained and modified through functionalization of naturally abundant chitin [14]. Additionally, a variety of valuable chemicals and materials can be accessed from chitin/chitosan under the concept of \"shell biorefinery\", which was proposed recently and gathered much attention immediately afterwards [15]. Up to now, chitosan anchored with different transition metals, for example palladium, titanium, rhodium, and copper have exhibited high catalytic activities towards several kinds of bond formations, such as CB [16], CC (Scheme 1a) [17], CN (Scheme 1b) [18], CO [19], CS (Scheme 1c) [20], and CSi [21] bond construction [22]. Significantly, transition metals immobilize on the chitosan to form stable compounds, and in some cases chitosan can even be used as metal remover in aqueous solutions [23]. It is very meaningful to extend the application of chitosan based heterogeneous catalyst to novel organic transformations. In continuation of our research topic on the development of synthetic methodologies [9,24], and in combination with our interests in heterogeneous catalysis, herein we wish to elaborate a chitosan supported cuprous chloride as an efficient and recyclable catalyst for the preparation of a wide range of alkyl/aryl mixed phosphates deriving from diphenylphosphoryl azides and aliphatic alcohols under aerobic conditions (Scheme 1d). 2 Experimental part 2.1 Materials All reagents and reactants were procured from Energy Chemical (Shanghai) and used as received. Technical grade solvents for extraction and chromatography (ethyl acetate, petroleum ether, and diethyl ether) were distilled prior to use and other solvents were used directly without further purification. 2.2 Instrumentation methods The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained by a powder X-ray diffractometer (SmartLAB SE, Rigaku). The micromorphology of the heterogeneous catalyst was observed via scanning electron microscope (SEM, Carl Zeiss SIGMA). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted with a Thermo Fisher Scientific Nexsa™ instrument equipped with an Al Kα X-ray radiation source (hν =1486.6 eV). The binding energies (BE) were referenced to the C1s peak at 284.5 eV. Peak fitting was performed by using XPSPEAK software with Shirley background. The actual metallic contents of catalysts was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) on an Agillent 700DV instrument. 50 mg of sample was first digested (in a mixture of HNO3, HF, and H2SO4) for 2 h. Then, aliquots of solution were diluted to 250 mL using deionized water. The diluted samples were introduced into the instrument and the area of the spectra obtained were correlated to the concentration (thereby element content in wt%) using a 5-point calibration curve in the range of 1–10 ppm. Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded on a Frontier-PerkinElmer FT-IR spectrophotometer equipped with an ATR unit with BaSO4 as a reference and were reported in wavenumbers (cm–1). Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on silica gel GF254 glass plates from Qingdao Haiyang Chemical Co. Lt. Flash column chromatography was performed on silica gel (300–400 mesh) by Qingdao Haiyang Chemical Co. Lt using the indicated solvents. 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 on Bruker Avance III 400 MHz instrument. High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) analyses were performed on an Agilent 6460 instrument. Gas chromatography (GC) was performed on a Fuli 9790II gas chromatography equipped with a KB-5 capillary column (30 m ×0.32 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness) by Fuli and high pure nitrogen as a carrier gas with flame ionization detector. 2.3 General procedure for the preparation of chitosan supported copper catalysts The chitosan supported copper catalysts were synthesized according to the following procedure: 5 g of chitosan was suspended in 100 mL of deionized water in a 250 mL round bottom flask. To this suspension, 1.0 g of CuSO4, Cu(OTf)2, CuCl, or Cu powder was added at 50 °C and stirred for 3 h. After adsorption of the copper, the solid was preconditioned by washing thoroughly to remove the unsupported copper salts. The CS@copper catalysts were obtained by using a centrifuge (5000 rpm/5 min) and dried under vacuum at 50 °C for 12 h. 2.4 General procedure for the synthesis of alkyl/aryl mixed phosphates A flame-dried Schlenk tube equipped with a magnetic stir bar was successively charged with phosphoryl azides (0.50 mmol, 1.0 equiv.), aliphatic alcohols (excess amount), CS@CuCl (30 mg, 10 mol% of [Cu] loading), and Na2CO3 (26 mg, 0.25 mmol, 0.5 equiv.) in indicated solvent or mixture (2.0 mL, 0.25 M). The reaction mixture was stirred at the indicated temperature and time. The reaction was monitored by TLC. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature and filtered. The solid stuff was washed with cyclohexane, dried in the oven, and collected to reuse for further catalytic reactions. The filtrate was diluted with ethyl acetate (25 mL) and washed with 1% HCl (aq, 5 mL) and H2O (5 mL). The organic phase was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure. Purification by flash column chromatography on silica gel using mixtures of petroleum ether and ethyl acetate as eluents afforded the analytically pure product. 3 Results and discussion Initially, the optimization process started by using DPPA (1a) as substrate and n-propyl alcohol (2a) as conventional nucleophile (Table 1 ). In the reaction setup, different chitosan supported copper salts were examined as heterogeneous catalysts. As illustrated, the model starting material indeed underwent deaminated esterification to form a new PO bond as expected, although the desired product 3aa, namely diphenyl propyl phosphate, was generated in very low conversions and yields at 40 °C (entries 1–4). It was shown that CS@CuCl gave the best performance among these candidates (entry 3). The molecular structure was confirmed unambiguously through NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) and HRMS (high resolution mass spectroscopic) analyses. Then several parameters such as reaction temperatures, additives, and reaction mediums were investigated. It has been proved that the reaction temperature played an important role in the reactivity. Elevating temperature from 40 °C to 80 °C could provide essential improvement of the isolated yields (entries 3, 5, and 6). Notably, the deaminated esterification underwent smoothly even with catalyst loading reduced by half, albeit with a lower yield and much longer reaction time (entry 7). Additives such as NaOH, Na2CO3, and NaHCO3 were evaluated to alter catalytic system, in which Na2CO3 obviously exhibited positive effect thereof (entries 8–10). Interestingly, the bare chitosan itself also showed low catalytic activity towards the model reaction (entry 11), providing promising evidence in this topic. Concerning the generality of our protocol and the increased solvent viscosity of other alcohols, we decided to introduce other solvent to form mixed reaction media. Non-polar solvent for example cyclohexane proved to be an ideal choice, giving rise to 90 % yield (entry 12). Therefore, the optimal conditions was performed with the aid of 10 mol% of CS@CuCl as catalyst, 0.5 equivalent of Na2CO3 as additive at 80 °C, under which either aliphatic alcohol alone or cyclohexane containing reaction medium performed equally well (entries 9 and 12). Importantly however, it was noteworthy that the isolated yields and conversions correlated very well, we did not detect any other by-product in this system with almost unreacted DPPA recovery (isolated after purification by flash column chromatography on silica gel, not shown). With the optimized catalytic conditions established, we were next promoted to investigate various phosphoryl azides 1a–1k and aliphatic alcohols 2a–2s with different substituents (Table 2 ). Not to our surprise, moderate to excellent results were obtained for all the straight chain fatty alcohols from C1 to C8 (2a–2c → 3aa–3ac, 2g → 3ag, 2i → 3ai, 2k–2m → 3ak–3am) (entries 1–3, 7, 9, and 11–13). Gratifyingly, methanol (2b) and ethanol (2c) represented highly reactive nucleophilic reagents, providing full conversions and 90–92 % yields within 3 h (entries 2–3). Moreover, the fluorinated derivatives trifluoroethanol (TFE, 2d) and hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP, 2f) afforded corresponding products in 84 % and 96 % yield, respectively (entries 3–6). When cycloalkyls substituted alcohols such as cyclopentanol (2n) and cyclohexanol (2o) were investigated, decreased results were obtained (entries 14 and 15). It might be attributed to the steric hindrance effect on the SN2 attack process. This hypothesis was convinced immediately with less bulky substrates 2p and 2q containing at least one methylene (CH2) group, and good results were realized though (entries 16 and 17). Remarkably, this protocol was not applicable for either benzyl alcohol (2r) or phenethyl alcohol (2s) bearing similar functional groups, however, only traces amounts of products were observed in these aromatic substrates (entries 18 and 19). Subsequently, we then turned our attention to examine different phosphoryl azides under identical reaction conditions with methanol (2b) as the oxygen source (Table 2). These reagents have been demonstrated to be effective under the heterogeneous catalysis, providing methyl diaryl phosphate derivatives in moderate to excellent yields. Generally, functional groups commonly existing in organic synthesis such as methyl (1b–1d), other alkyl (1g and 1h), methoxyl (1i and 1j), were well tolerated. However, bromo (1e and 1f) substituted substrates led to reduced yields (entries 20–28). Compared with phosphoryl azides bearing single substituent on the aromatic core, disubstituted starting material at both 3- and 5-positions had performed equally well, regardless of the electronic or steric properties (1k → 3ka) (entry 29). Furthermore, this heterogeneous catalysis was proceeded successfully in gram scale reaction with 86 % yield (5.0 mmol of 1a was employed as starting material), further demonstrated the practicality and scalability of our protocol (Table 2, entry 1). Based on the aforementioned results, we then extended the alcohols to more complicate glycerol derivative 2t and citronellol (2u) (Scheme 2 ). Compared with desired product 3au in 84 % yield, however, alcohol 2t with a dimethylketal group seemed unstable under basic conditions, and only moderate result was achieved finally. The XRD patterns of the pure chitosan itself and supported heterogeneous catalyst are illustrated in Fig. 1 . The data revealed that the related signal of copper did not show up. It was probably due to the fact that the copper species was adsorbed on the NH2 group of the supporter as ions rather than as particles, and thus no XRD signal was observed [20,25]. Furthermore, after the copper loading, the crystallinity of chitosan apparently decreased as indicated by XRD (Fig. 1a vs 1b), possibly due to the loosen chain arrangements with the incorporation of copper atoms. A comparison of the surface morphology of chitosan supported copper catalyst and recovered CS@CuCl after three runs is shown in Fig. 2 . The SEM images of the catalyst examined before and after the heterogeneous catalytic application did not show significant changes in the morphology, although the surface of the spent catalyst became more smoother and the colour was getting lighter compared with the fresh-prepared catalyst. FT-IR spectra of fresh-prepared and recovered CS@CuCl catalyst are illustrated in Fig. 3 and display a broad range of multiple strong absorption between 3600–3200 cm−1. Compared with pure chitosan (Fig. S1), the wide peak at around 3424 cm−1, corresponding to the vibrations of OH and NH2 groups, shifted to a lower frequency in the fresh-prepared catalyst (Fig. 3a, for spectra with peaks, see Fig. S2); indicated that these groups were involved in the complexation. The absorption band at 1649 cm−1 and 1599 cm−1 assigned to the acetamide and amine group, respectively, disappeared in the supported catalyst (Figs. S1 vs 3a/b) [23,26]. Interestingly, a new absorption band at 1632 cm-1 appeared, which was probably the characteristic peak of the chitosan-copper association, indicated that the “free” amine group interacted with the copper [26]. In addition, the absorption bands at 1065 cm−1 (CO groups) shifted to a lower frequency; suggested that OH groups also took part in the reaction (Fig. 3a). The peak at 2100–2000 cm-1 of the spent catalyst illustrated the azide group’s existence (Fig. 3b). It seems that traces amount of DPPA would remain on the chitosan supporter after the recovery. It is worthy of note that there are no obvious changes of the spectra for the recycled heterogeneous catalyst (spectra with peaks could be found in the Figs. S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Data). The loading amount of copper in the fresh-prepared and recovered catalysts were determined by chemical analysis using ICP-OES and the results are summarized in Table 3 . After three cycles of catalysis, decline in copper content from 9.46 % to 8.24 % (weight percentage) was observed, indicating that the copper species were indeed slowly dissociated from chitosan supporter either during the catalysis or recovered process [27], and this result might be responsible for the loss of activity. XPS technique is usually adopted with the objective to elucidate the chemical states of various elements in the materials’ surface [28]. In Fig. 4 , it shows three sets of Cu 2p binding energies of high-resolution XPS for fresh-prepared and used CS@CuCl catalyst. The survey spectra showed obvious binding energy peaks of Cu 2p and clearly displayed the co-existence of Cu2+ and Cu+ on the surface of both samples. In one hand, the existence of Cu2+ could be identified by the peaks at 934.0 eV (Cu 2p3/2) and 953.2 eV (Cu 2p1/2), respectively. In addition, the strong Cu2+ satellites peaks located at both 943.4 eV and 963.2 eV further allowed to conclude the existence of Cu2+ species. In the other hand, the relative strong peaks at binding energies of 932.1 eV (Cu 2p3/2) and 951.6 eV (Cu 2p1/2) respectively confirmed the presence of the Cu+ species. It can be obviously concluded that the two spectra showed highly overlapped curves with each other. It should be noticed that the surface atomic ratio of Cu2+ to Cu+ exhibited very small changes from 0.18 for the fresh-prepared CS@CuCl (Fig. 4a) to 0.16 for recovered catalyst after three runs (Fig. 4b). In order to further study the application of this protocol, the reusability of chitosan supported heterogeneous catalyst was discussed (Fig. 5 ). The recycling studies on the indicated substrates revealed that the catalytic activity was not deteriorated dramatically after three cycles. However, it was not clear enough to explain the loss of activity since the ICP-OES characterization only showed little evidence associated with the copper species indeed leaching either during the catalytic reaction or work-up procedure. Furthermore, we evaluated the catalyst for more runs, the catalytic activities continued to decrease, for the fourth and fifth run, 80 % and 71 % isolated product were obtained. The conversion of DPPA determined by GC analysis using tetracosane as internal standard for all five cycles were 96 %, 92 %, 85 %, 82 %, and 77 %, respectively. 4 Conclusion To sum up, we have reported herein a chitosan supported copper catalyzed transformation for the conversion of PN bonds into PO bonds through nucleophilic substitution reaction under aerobic conditions. Our results represent the first examples for the reactions of phosphoryl azides and aliphatic alcohols catalyzed by a heterogeneous catalyst, presenting as an attractive alternative protocol to the exiting approach. The deaminated esterification was conducted smoothly and generating the nitrogen gas as byproduct. This methodology enables preparation of a broad rang of alkyl/aryl mixed phosphates in moderate to excellent yields. Additionally, our practical are attractive concerning reaction scalability and catalyst recyclability. Characterization for both fresh-prepared and recycled heterogeneous catalyst by XRD, FT-IR, XPS, ICP-OES, and TEM demonstrated the high stability and recyclability. The decreased copper content of the recovered catalyst indicated that active copper species was leaching during the reaction or workup procedure, and might be responsibly for the activity loss. Further extension of its application towards aromatic ring containing alcohols and related mechanistic studies are currently undertaking in our laboratory.

        "dc:description": "An efficient methodology was established for the preparation of alkyl/aryl mixed phosphates under aerobic conditions promoted by a easily recoverable heterogeneous catalyst. This highly active copper catalyst was obtained by directly mixing of copper precursor with chitosan solution, followed by a simple work-up process. In this catalytic system, different phosphoryl azides and aliphatic alcohols were employed to generate desired products in moderate to excellent yields with good functional group tolerance. This protocol provided a practical application of the chitosan supported heterogeneous copper catalyst towards a novel PO bond formation.",
