ZnCl2/NaY catalyst prepared by a novel method of solid-state interaction between ZnCl2 and NaY zeolite under microwave irradiation is shown to catalyze efficiently the Diels–Alder reaction. Excellent catalytic activity and high regioselectivity of ‘para/meta’ are achieved. The new Lewis acid sites formed on the surface of NaY zeolite are responsible for the high regioselective synthesis of ‘para’ myrac aldehyde. A novel catalyst preparation method is developed by solid-state interaction between ZnCl2 and NaY zeolite under microwave irradiation. The solid-state interaction is investigated by powder X-ray diffraction, FT-IR spectroscopy, and by testing the catalytic properties in the Diels–Alder reaction of myrcene and acrolein. XRD patterns indicate that ZnCl2 can disperse completely on the surface of NaY zeolite at the ZnCl2 loading less than 2.75mmolg−1. FT-IR spectra of pyridine adsorption on catalyst show that Lewis acid sites are the predominant acid sites. The catalyst of ZnCl2/NaY prepared by the treatment of microwave irradiation is proved to be an effective heterogeneous catalyst for high regioselective Diels–Alder reaction of myrcene and acrolein. The catalytic activity and the regioselectivity of p/m strongly depend on the ZnCl2 loading. With an increase of the ZnCl2 loading up to 0.92mmolg−1, the activity and selectivity increase a little. In this case, the active site is deduced from the zinc ion species formed by solid-state ion exchange. The Lewis acid sites are too weak to catalyze efficiently the Diels–Alder reaction. Keeping an increase of ZnCl2 loading from 0.92mmolg−1 to 1.84mmolg−1, the activity and the regioselctivity of p/m increased markedly due to the formation of new zinc ion species of –O–Zn–Cl as Lewis acid sites on NaY zeolite. The catalysts leached with a mixture solvent of acrolein and dichloromethane show little loss of catalytic activity and selectivity. Thanks to the possibility of simple and safe handling of the ZnCl2/NaY and to its easy separation from organic products, it becomes an alternative Lewis acid catalyst for the Diels–Alder reaction to homogeneous Lewis acids. Keywords Zinc chloride NaY zeolite Microwave irradiation Diels–Alder reaction Myrcene Myrac aldehyde 1 Introduction The Diels–Alder reaction of myrcene (7-methyl-3-methene-1,6-octadiene) prepared by cracking β-pinene from turpentine oil, gives rise to a variety of fragrant compounds and their intermediates when reacting with a conjugated alkylene carbonyl compound [1–5]. The regiochemistry of the cyclohexene derivates often include ‘para’ and ‘meta adduct’, which is outlined in Scheme 1 . In general, the ‘para’ adduct is more important than the ‘meta’ adduct in the synthesis of new perfumes, medical drugs, and biological active substances [1,2,6–9]. For example, the ‘para’ myrac aldehyde (4-(4′-methyl-3′-pentyl)-Δ3-cyclohexenecarboxaldehyde) and their derivates are often used “as is” in perfumery. Furthermore, the products with a pleasant ‘woody and fruity ambergris smell’, which is from the subsequent cyclization of the ‘para’ cycloadducts, have been found to be very useful in perfumes, colognes, cosmetic powders and dryer-added fabric softeners articles, as well as in cigarette and smoking tobacco articles [8]. How to improve the regiosectivity of ‘para’ cycloadduct for the Diels–Ader reaction therefore becomes considerable practical interest. Homogenous Lewis acids are often used as catalysts for accelerating the reaction and enhancing the regioseletivity and stereoselectivty. The catalyst of ZnCl2 showed excellent regioselectivity and activity for the Diels–Alder reaction of myrcene and acrolein [10]. However, it is well known that the homogenous Lewis acids have serious drawbacks such as the use of more than one molar equivalent, laborious work-up procedures and problems with environmentally hazardous waste-streams. It has been found that several inorganic solids, such as alumina [11], zeolite [12], clays [13], mesoporous aluminosilicate (Al-HMS) [14,15] are efficient catalysts in Diels–Alder reactions of cyclopentadiene. Mayoral and co-workers found that clay calcination improved the activity of the catalyst, which can be recovered without a loss of its catalytic activity [16]. However, in reactions of carbonyl-containing dienophiles, the activity is far less than that of traditional Lewis acids in homogeneous reactions. Given the interest of Diels–Alder reactions, it is important to search for solid with better catalytic properties for reaction of carbonyl-containing dienophiles. Lewis acids supported on solids can take the advantages of Lewis acids and inorganic solid, in which many studies have been carried out showing that the modified catalysts can be successfully used in obtaining the high reactivity and selectivity for the Diels–Alder reaction [13–22]. The modified Lewis acids catalysts are usually prepared by the reaction of mono- and di-surface hydroxyl group on the support of silica, alumina, K10 montmorillonites, zeolite, and Al-HMS with Lewis acids of BF3, ZnCl2, FeCl3, aluminium and titanium derivates (chlorides, ethyl and diethyl aluminium chlorides, titanium diisopropoxide dicholoride, titanium tetraisopropoxide). The resulting catalysts contain mainly Lewis acid sites, which are effectively used in the Lewis acid-catalyzed organic reaction. Recently, immobilization of anhydrous AlCl3 on mesoporous silicate of MCM-41 and anhydrous ZnCl2 impregnated on Mont-K10 were reported by Zhao and Choudhary, respectively [23,24]. The anhydrous chlorides supported on porous solid by the solvent impregnation method possess strong Lewis acid properties for the liquid-phase Lewis acid catalyzed reaction. One disadvantage of this method for industrial applications is the handing of large volumes of solutions during the preparation process of the catalysts. Thus, an alternative method of dispersing active species by solid-state reaction has attracted increasing attention in the last decade [25–30]. The solid-state interaction between ZnCl2 and NaY zeolite has been carried out in our early studies indicated that ZnCl2 can be completely dispersed onto the surface of NaY zeolite at the ZnCl2 loading less than 37.5wt.% [28]. It is found that the dispersed ZnCl2 undergoes solid-state ion exchange with Na+ and coordinates with oxygen from the surface of the support. However, the surface acidic properties of the catalyst are still not defined. Based on both practical and scientific interest, we reported here a more detailed investigation of the preparation method of ZnCl2/NaY catalyst by activation of microwave irradiation and used as a heterogeneous catalyst for high regioselctive synthesis of myrac aldehyde. The surface acidic nature created during the solid-state interaction under microwave irradiation was evaluated by the catalytic performance in the Diels–Alder reaction. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Myrcene prepared by cracking β-pinene was described elsewhere [31]. Anhydrous ZnCl2 was prepared by using dichlorosulfoxide (SOCl2) to dehydrated ZnCl2·2H2O [10], the left SOCl2 was then removed by distillation under vacuum. The obtained anhydrous ZnCl2 was kept in a vacuum desiccator with potassium hydroxide over night prior to use. Acrolein was purchased from Aldrich and freshly distilled before use. NaY and Na-ZSM-5 zeolite (Si/Al ratio 2.6) obtained from Changling oil refine Corp., China, were calcined at 550°C for 5h prior to use. HY zeolite was prepared by NaY zeolite (20g) suspended in 200ml of 1M ammonium chloride solution. The slurry was stirred at 90°C for 6h, filtered and washed chloride free with deionised water. The ion exchange operation was repeated five times. The resulting solid was dried in an oven at 110°C for 6h, and then calcined in a muffle furnace at 550°C for 3h. ZnNaY zeolite was prepared by ion exchange of a 1M aqueous ZnCl2 solution and NaY (pH=6.0) with a liquid/solid mass ratio of 10 at 90°C for 6h. The mixture was then filtered and washed chloride free with deionised water. The following drying and calcined procedures were same to the preparation of HY zeolite. The degree of ion exchange of 71% was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). 2.2 Preparation of catalysts Mixtures of NaY zeolite and anhydrous ZnCl2 with different loading were ground in an agate mortar to obtain well-powder and homogenized samples. The resulting mixtures were irradiated in a microwave oven at 650W, 2450MHz for 15min, and then the catalyst was removed from the microwave oven while hot and it was kept in a desiccator to cool to room temperature prior to use. For comparison, another catalyst prepared by heating method was also involved in this study. The well-powder and homogenized sample of NaY zeolite and anhydrous ZnCl2 was heated in a muffle furnace at 200°C for 1h. and then the catalyst was transferred to a desiccator to cool to room temperature. The physical mixtures sample of ZnCl2 and NaY was prepared by simple grinding the mixtures only. 2.3 Catalyst characterization The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded on a Siemens D 500 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ=1.542Å). Infrared spectra were collected on a Nicolet 510P FT-IR spectrophotometer. Acidic properties of the samples were determined by chemical adsorption of pyridine as a probe molecule on self-supported wafers. The wafers were compressed under 5t/cm2 pressure to obtain thin disks 12mm in diameter with a thickness of ca. 3mm. The resulting wafers were placed in cells (equipped with KBr windows and connected via stopcocks to a vacuum line) where the treatment of the catalysts was performed. Catalyst was activated in an IR cell at 200°C under vacuum for 1h, cooled down to 100°C, followed by exposure to pyridine at this temperature for 30min. The sample was then evacuated at this temperature under vacuum (10−5 Torr) for 1h to remove physical adsorbed pyridine. Finally, the spectrum was recorded at room temperature. 2.4 General procedure for Diels–Alder reaction of myrcene Under argon, 42.8mmol of acrolein was added to a suspension of the catalyst (1g) in 5.0ml of freshly distilled dichloromethane with vigorously stirring in a magnetic stirrer. After the mixture was heated up to 30°C, 35.3mmol of myrcene was added via a syringe. The reaction was monitored by gas chromatography (FID, SE-30 column, 25 m×0.25 mm), nitrogen as a carrier gas, injector temperature 200°C, the detector temperature 180°C, oven temperature program 120°C (4 min)→24°C/min→190 °C (9min), using trans-naphthane as an internal standard substance. After completion of the reaction, the catalyst was filtered, washed with dichloromethane. The filtrate was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride, and then dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The resulting solution was distilled and purified under vacuum. The product of myrac aldehyde was identified with a GC-MS and FT-IR spectra, which is in good agreement with the authentic sample. m/z: 192 [M + peak], 177 [192-CH3]+, 149 [177-CHO]+, 122 [192-CH2CHCHO]+, 93 [122-CHO]+, 69 [(CH3)2CHCH2]+, 41 [CH2CHCH2]+, 29 [CHO]+. IR cm−1: 2820, 2720, 1730, 1390,1370, 1205 and 805. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst characterization Some salts can disperse spontaneously onto the surface of a suitable support with a highly specific surface after the heat treatment, which can be identified by the disappearance of the crystalline phase of the salts from their XRD patterns [32]. The XRD patterns of ZnCl2 and ZnCl2/NaY samples prepared by different methods are shown in Fig. 1 . It can be seen that the appearance of diffraction peak of ZnCl2 is apparent in the XRD pattern (2θ=16.3°) of the physical mixture sample of ZnCl2/NaY (Fig. 1(a)). The peaks of crystalline ZnCl2 do not disappear but are slightly reduced after the heat treatment at 200°C for 1h (Fig. 1(b)). It suggests that heating at this temperature can help ZnCl2 to disperse onto the surface of NaY zeolite, but not to diffuse sufficiently. However, The crystalline phase of ZnCl2 has vanished in the sample of ZnCl2/NaY when the mixture of ZnCl2 and NaY zeolite was irradiated by microwave even at high ZnCl2 loading of 2.75mmolg−1 (Fig. 1(c)). It is found that no sold solutions has been formed between ZnCl2 and NaY zeolite after the sample was treated via microwave irradiation. It seems to us that ZnCl2 has dispersed completely onto the surface of the NaY zeolite under microwave irradiation. Our early studies revealed that the zinc ions took place solid-state ion exchange with the Na+ in NaY zeolite, and also some of the dispersed ZnCl2 reacted with the oxygen ions to form –O–Zn–Cl under microwave irradiation [28]. The surface bond between the dispersed ZnCl2 and the oxygen of support is usually strong enough which could be verified by IR spectra. Choudary et al. also found that an occurrence of reaction between ZnCl2 and the surface hydroxyl groups of the Mont-K10 clay leading to formation of new Lewis acid sites (–O–Zn–Cl) by the thermal activation [24]. And also, the solid-state ion exchange reaction by heating treatment makes zinc cation distributions more homogeneous than the conventional ion exchange from salt solution to form ZnY zeolite [33]. It is also noted that some loss of crystallinity of NaY zeolite take place in this sample, which can not be exclusively attributed to the dilution effects caused by high ZnCl2 loading. Fig. 2 shows the pyridine-FTIR spectra of (a) ZnCl2/NaY and (b) the physical mixture of ZnCl2 and NaY zeolite. It can be seen both of the two samples exhibit bands at 1548, 1498 and 1452cm−1. The band at 1548cm−1 is attributed to Brönsted acid sites, the band at 1452cm−1 is assigned to Lewis acid sites, and the band at 1498cm−1 is assigned to a combination signal associated with both Brönsted and Lewis acid sites. Judged from the IR spectra, Lewis acid sites are the predominant acid sites for the two samples. However, the intensity of the band around 1548cm−1 in the ZnCl2/NaY sample treated with microwave irradiation is less intense than that in the physical mixture. It is suggested that the Brönsted acidity in the physical mixture of ZnCl2/NaY may be induced by polarization of their solvating water molecules when grinding the mixture. 3.2 Effect of catalyst preparation method on catalytic properties The catalytic properties of the various catalysts are evaluated in terms of the conversion of myrcene (activity), the selectivity of the cycloadducts, and the regioselectivity (p/m). The results of the Diels–Alder reaction between myrcene and acrolein in the absence or presence of various catalysts prepared by different methods are summarized in Table 1 . Without catalyst, the thermal reaction is too slow and exhibits poor regioselectivity (entry 1). The parent NaY zeolite without acidic properties shows similar results to that of thermal reaction (entry 2). It is expected that the catalytic activity and regioselectivity increase over HY zeolite catalyst due to its relative strong acidic properties, but the selectivity of the cycloadducts decreases a little (entry 3). When ZnNaY zeolite prepared by solution ion exchange of ZnCl2 and NaY zeolite is used as a catalyst, the activity increases twofolds and the regioselectivity increases slightly (entry 4). This enhancement of catalytic activity can be explained by the Lewis acid sites of zinc ions in the ZnNaY zeolite created by ion exchange, but the acid strength of this type of zinc species bonded two oxygen are not strong enough to catalyze the reaction. The typical homogeneous Lewis acid of ZnCl2 shows good activity and regioselectivity, but the selectivity of cycloadducts is decreased (entry 5). The physical mixture of ZnCl2 and NaY zeolite exhibits almost same activity, selectivity of cycloadducts and regioselectivity of p/m to the homogeneous Lewis acid of ZnCl2 due to the similar active sites (entry 6). Comparing with the physical mixture of ZnCl2/NaY catalyst, the selectivity of cycloadducts increase somewhat over the ZnCl2/NaY catalyst prepared by heat treatment (entry 7). It is noticeable that ZnCl2/NaY catalyst prepared by microwave irradiation shows the best selectivity of cycloadducts, high regioselectivity of p/m and similar activity of homogeneous ZnCl2 (entry 8). These observations should be attributed to the completely dispersed ZnCl2 on the surface of NaY zeolite, and also some of dispersed ZnCl2 react with surface oxygen ions to form new Lewis acid sites of –O–Zn–Cl, which is in good agreement with the discussion of XRD patterns of Fig. 1(c) and the IR spectra of Fig. 2(a). The catalyst prepared by microwave irradiation can be interpreted as heating method. Significantly, the use of microwave technologies to prepare ZnCl2/NaY catalyst shows the advantages of not only reducing time and also without contamination during catalyst preparation as compared to the conventional heating method. However, when HY zeolite used as a support to prepare the catalyst under microwave irradiation, the selectivity of cycloadducts decreases apparently (entry 9). Whittington reported that zeolites in the H form adsorbed little energy of microwave irradiation [34]. In this case, the active sites should be from the homogenous ZnCl2 and the Brönsted acid sites of HY zeolite. The decrease of the selectivity for cycloadducts is due to the subsequent cyclization of the cycloadducts of myrac aldehyde and oligomerization of myrcene by Brönsted acid sites [8]. Overall, the suitable Lewis acid sites and the mid-acid strength of the catalysts are responsible for the high regioselective Diels–Alder reaction of myrcene and acrolein. The preparation of ZnCl2/NaY catalyst by solid-state interaction of ZnCl2 and NaY zeolite under microwave irradiation is developed the best method among them. Table 2 shows the effect of adsorbed water in NaY zeolite on the ZnCl2/NaY catalysts prepared by different methods for the Diels–Alder reaction. The results indicate that the activity, selectivity of cycloadducts and regioselectivity of p/m over the physical mixture of ZnCl2 and hydrated NaY zeolite are less significantly than that of ZnCl2/NaY catalysts prepared by heat and microwave treatment. The existence of water in the catalyst of physical mixture of ZnCl2/NaY leads to the ability of zinc ions to enhance the Brönsted acidity of catalyst by polarization of their solvating water molecules and to reduce the Lewis acid sites. It is known that microwave energy can be used to remove the water retained in sodium form zeolite. The catalyst prepared by microwave irradiation still exhibits the best catalytic behavior among the three catalysts preparation methods. However, Some loss of activity and selectivity in the ZnCl2/NaY catalyst prepared by microwave irradiation comparing with in Table 1 (entry 8) are due to the water retained in NaY zeolite not to be removed completely. 3.3 Effect of ZnCl2 loading on the catalytic properties A series of experiments is carried out using the ZnCl2/NaY catalyst prepared by microwave irradiation for the Diels–Alder reaction to examine the effect of ZnCl2 loading on the catalytic properties. The results are listed in Table 3 . It can be seen that the catalytic activity and selectivity of cycloadducts remain almost unchanged with an increase of the ZnCl2 loading from 0.46 to 0.92mmolg−1, which are very similar to that of ZnNaY catalyst prepared by the conventional ion exchange in solution. The results suggest that the dispersed ZnCl2 onto the NaY zeolite under microwave irradiation take place mainly solid-state ion exchange between Zn2+ with Na+ in NaY zeolite, but the acidic strength of this type of Zn2+ species is too weak to catalyze efficiently the Diels–Alder reaction. With an increase of ZnCl2 loading up to 1.84mmolg−1, the activity and regioselectivity increase markedly. In this case, the dispersed ZnCl2 bonded on the surface of NaY zeolite plays great role in the high regioselctive synthesis of myrac aldehyde and shows excellent activity. The catalytic mechanism is proposed by the coordination of Lewis acid site of Zn2+ with the carbonyl of acrolein, which is described in detail in our early studies [10]. The activity and regioselectivity of p/m increase slightly with an increase of ZnCl2 loading from 1.84 up to 2.75mmolg−1. The decrease of the selectivity of cycloadducts with increasing of ZnCl2 loading is supposed to be the oligomerization of myrcene at a high ZnCl2 loading. 3.4 The status of ZnCl2 onto NaY zeolite under microwave irradiation The XRD results and the effect of ZnCl2 loading on the catalytic performances indicated that ZnCl2/NaY catalysts prepared by solid-state interaction between ZnCl2 and NaY zeolite under microwave irradiation can lead to ZnCl2 disperse completely onto the surface of NaY zeolite at ZnCl2 loading less than 2.75mmolg−1. What’s the status of ZnCl2 on the surface of NaY zeolite thus becomes interesting. In order to study the status of ZnCl2 depended on loading, a further set of experiments is designed to investigate the solid-state interaction between anhydrous ZnCl2 and NaY zeolite under microwave irradiation by testing their catalytic performances in the reaction, which is shown in Table 4 . If the sample of ZnCl2/NaY at the ZnCl2 loading of 0.46mmolg−1 prepared by microwave irradiation is washed chloride free with deionised water, and then dried and calcined at 773K for 3h, there is no change of the catalytic performances over the treated ZnCl2/NaY catalyst (entry 4) compared with that over the fresh prepared ZnCl2/NaY catalyst without any treatment (entry 3). The result indicates that the dispersed Zn2+ can not be washed out of NaY zeolite by water. We would like to know if the dispersed ZnCl2 could be leached out by the solvent and the dienophile or not. Another experiment is performed to leach the catalyst (1g) after microwave treatment with a mixture of solvent of acrolein (5ml) and dichloromethane (5ml) at the reaction conditions for 1h, and then filtrated. The resulted solid was used as a catalyst again in the reaction (entry 5). No change of catalytic performance is also observed, which suggest that ZnCl2 onto the surface of NaY zeolite can not also be leached by the solvent and acrolein. All of the catalytic behaviors (entries 3–5) are similar to that of ZnNaY catalyst prepared by the conventional ion exchange in solution (entry 2). These features suggest that microwave irradiation only accelerate the solid-state ion exchange between ZnCl2 and NaY zeolite at a low ZnCl2 loading, and also the exchanged Zn2+ in the zeolite can not be leached by water, reactant and solvent. In the case of a high ZnCl2 loading, the catalytic activity and regioselectivity of p/m keep almost same even the ZnCl2/NaY catalyst is leached with a mixture solvent of acrolein and dichloromethane for 1h at the reaction conditions (entry 6). The observation indicates that the dispersed ZnCl2 can be immobilized onto the surface of NaY zeolite by forming the bond of –O–Zn–Cl used as a effective heterogeneous catalyst. This type of zinc species also can be explained by the catalytic behaviors of the Diels–Alder reaction over the catalyst of ZnCl2/Na-ZSM-5 (entry 7). It is found that the catalytic activity and the regioselectity of p/m over the ZnCl2/Na-ZSM-5 catalyst is far less than that over ZnCl2/NaY catalyst even at the same ZnCl2 loading of 2.75mmolg−1. The loss of activity is attributed to the larger dynamic molecule size of the cycloadduct of myrac aldehyde blocking them to diffuse out of the channel of ZSM-5 zeolite. The dispersed ZnCl2 onto the internal surface of ZSM-5 also can not dissolve in the reactants and solvent. The catalytic activity is expected from the ZnCl2 dispersed on the external surface of ZSM-5 zeolite. This example gives us a further explanation that microwave irradiation can make anhydrous ZnCl2 immobilize on the surface of NaY zeolite. 4 Conclusion The solid-state interaction between ZnCl2 and NaY zeolite for preparation of ZnCl2/NaY catalysts by the treatment of different methods is compared. XRD patterns indicate that ZnCl2 can disperse completely on the surface of NaY zeolite under microwave irradiation. The ZnCl2/NaY catalysts treated by microwave irradiation are proved to be effective heterogeneous catalysts for high regioselective Diels–Alder reaction of myrcene and acrolein. The catalytic activity and regioselctivity strongly depend on the nature and the acid strength of the solid catalysts. Brönsted acid sites easily leads to decrease of selectivity and regioselectivity due to the subsequent cyclization for the cycloadducts of myrac aldehyde at high concentration and oligomerization of myrcene. The characteristic IR bands indicated that the active species are Lewis acid sites, which are responsible for the Diels–Alder reaction. The Lewis acid strength is also an important factor for catalyst to have a high activity and regioselectivity. If the ZnCl2 loading less than of 0.92mmolg−1, the activity and selectivity is not high due to the dispersed ZnCl2 mainly takes place solid-state ion exchange. This type of zinc species is not too strong enough for the Diels–Alder reaction. The catalytic activity and regioselectivity increase markedly when ZnCl2 loading increases from 0.92 to 1.84mmolg−1, which are attributed to the dispersed ZnCl2 leads to formation of new Lewis acid sites of –O–Zn–Cl. The mid-strength Lewis acid sites show the high regioselective in the synthesis of ‘para’ myrac aldehyde for the Diels–Alder reaction. The best catalytic activity (myrcene conversion of 89.8%) and regioselctivity (p/m=93:7) are achieved over ZnCl2/NaY catalyst at the optimum ZnCl2 loading of 2.75mmolg−1. The active sites in the catalyst can not be leached from acrolein and solvent, which suggest that the preparation of ZnCl2/NaY catalyst by solid-state interaction under microwave irradiation is a promising method for developing environmental friendly alternative catalyst for the Diels–Alder reaction.

The solid-state interaction is investigated by powder X-ray diffraction, FT-IR spectroscopy, and by testing the catalytic properties in the Diels–Alder reaction of myrcene and acrolein. XRD patterns indicate that ZnCl2 can disperse completely on the surface of NaY zeolite at the ZnCl2 loading less than 2.75mmolg−1. FT-IR spectra of pyridine adsorption on catalyst show that Lewis acid sites are the predominant acid sites. The catalyst of ZnCl2/NaY prepared by the treatment of microwave irradiation is proved to be an effective heterogeneous catalyst for high regioselective Diels–Alder reaction of myrcene and acrolein. The catalytic activity and the regioselectivity of p/m strongly depend on the ZnCl2 loading. With an increase of the ZnCl2 loading up to 0.92mmolg−1, the activity and selectivity increase a little. In this case, the active site is deduced from the zinc ion species formed by solid-state ion exchange. The Lewis acid sites are too weak to catalyze efficiently the Diels–Alder reaction. Keeping an increase of ZnCl2 loading from 0.92mmolg−1 to 1.84mmolg−1, the activity and the regioselctivity of p/m increased markedly due to the formation of new zinc ion species of –O–Zn–Cl as Lewis acid sites on NaY zeolite. The catalysts leached with a mixture solvent of acrolein and dichloromethane show little loss of catalytic activity and selectivity. Thanks to the possibility of simple and safe handling of the ZnCl2/NaY and to its easy separation from organic products, it becomes an alternative Lewis acid catalyst for the Diels–Alder reaction to homogeneous Lewis acids.",
