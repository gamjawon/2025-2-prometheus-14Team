Graphical abstract 2,3-dimethylbutane is selectively converted into 2,3-dimethylbutenes at 500 °C under hydrogen or at 390 °C under nitrogen in the presence of bimetallic catalysts Pt-Sn/Li-Al2O3. The high stability of the catalyst along the reaction is obtained by selective modification of the Pt/Li-Al2O3 catalyst using Surface Organometallic Chemistry (SOMC). Keywords Li-functionalized γ-alumina Pt, PtSn, PtGe nanoparticles 2,3-Dimethylbutene Spectroscopic characterization Continuous flow reactor 1 Introduction Dimethylbutenes are important reagents for both chemical and polymer industries. For example, 2,3-dimethylbutenes is needed for the synthesis of aromatic musks like Tonalide® [1,2]. In the field of polymerisation, 2,3-dimethylbutenes are referred as TME and used as crosslinking agents [3]. 2,3-dimethylbutenes (DMBs = DMB-1 + DMB-2) are provided by the dimerisation of propylene over Ni catalysts, known as the Difasol™ process [4]. As the growing global demand for propylene results in the increase of its price, other processes to obtain selectively DMBs have become attractive. These molecules can be obtained through different approaches. We previously reported that tungsten hydride supported on γ-alumina or γ-alumina modified by nickel or silicon allowed to convert isobutene into DMBs at low temperature with high selectivity [5,6]. WOCl4 supported on silica dehydroxylated at 200 °C followed by alkylation with SnMe4 achieved excellent performances in isobutene self-metathesis to DMB-2 [7]. Another way to produce those valuable compounds is the use of well-defined Cu nanoparticles supported on alumina prepared by SOMC which showed high selectively in hydrogenation of 2,3-dimethylbutadiene to 2,3-dimethylbutenes. This alternative method opens the gate for bio-sourced 2,3-dimethylbutene originated from dehydration of pinacol [8]. In the perspective of an industrial application, 2,3-dimethylbutane is a cheap starting material compared to the corresponding alkenes and can easily be obtained through isomerisation of n-hexane [9]. The dehydrogenation reaction can be an important way to produce 2,3-dimethylbutenes (DMB-1 and DMB-2) from such readily available starting material. Most alkane dehydrogenation catalysts are based on supported transition metals. Supported non-noble metals such as chromium or vanadium can be economically advantageous but the obtained selectivity in higher olefins is low due to the cracking reactions. Supported noble metal particles, with or without promoters, have been widely explored [10]. Dehydrogenation catalysts based on platinum are frequently used in petrochemistry for example in reforming or in isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene. Bimetallic PtSn supported on γ-alumina has been extensively used for dehydrogenation of both light and higher hydrocarbons. Many studies showed that the presence of Sn has an important effect on the selectivity and inhibits sintering of Pt clusters allowing to improve the stability of the catalyst towards deactivation by coking, and prevents hydrocracking, hydrogenolysis and isomerisation reactions [11–16]. Indeed, the addition of alkali metals as promoters allows neutralising the surface acidity and inhibiting the isomerisation reaction of hydrocarbon. Other studies reported that alkali metals might promote H2 spillover and prevent coke deposition [17–22]. In most cases, the bimetallic catalysts are prepared by the classical methods (successive impregnation, co-impregnation and sol-gel) of platinum and tin salts [23–27]. Nevertheless, the impregnation procedure does not lead to the exclusive formation of bimetallic particles. The co-existence of isolated tin and platinum monometallic phase may give low selectivity in desired product in particular for the dehydrogenation of hexanes by isomerisation and aromatisation reactions [27,28]. Preparation techniques play a significant role in controlling the type of materials obtained. Surface organometallic chemistry on oxide (SOMC/Oxide) and metals (SOMC/M) leads to well-defined bimetallic catalysts whose active sites have high homogeneity in their nature [8]. On the other hand, improving selectivity also requires inhibiting the acid-catalyzed reactions on the support (cracking, isomerisation, aromatisation and polymerisation). A most common method is to introduce additives, such as basic alkaline elements. The reaction of a tin organometallic compound with metallic surfaces has been pioneered by Yermakov and Ryndin in the 1970s [29,30]. This surface organometallic chemistry approach has been extensively studied in our laboratory for isobutane dehydrogenation. In fact platinum and rhodium nanoparticles carried on silica have been succesfully modified by tin or germanium [31–34]. The latter synthetic approach affords selective localisation of the Sn or Ge atoms on the Pt nanoparticles, as previously confirmed by Mössbauer and EXAFS spectroscopies. The resulting catalysts, prepared by SOMC on metal, display high selectivity and stability during isobutane dehydrogenation under hydrogen due to well-defined bimetallic Pt-Sn phase. In the literature, there are only few examples reporting the selective dehydrogenation of 2,3-dimethylbutane [35–37]. However, no example reports the conversion of 2,3-dimethylbutane into 2,3-dimethylbutenes on γ-alumina supported bimetallic PtSn catalyst prepared by SOMC. In this paper, we demonstrate a stable and selective catalyst for the dehydrogenation of dimethylbutanes to 2,3-dimethylbutenes based on Pt nano-particles supported on alumina. Furthermore, different promoting agents have been employed through the SOMC methodology on alumina and on the platinum nanoparticle in order to identify the most performing catalyst. 2 Experimental 2.1 General procedures All experiments were carried out by using standard Schlenk and glove-box techniques. Solvents were purified and dried according to standard procedures. Al2O3-(500) was prepared with Alumina from Evonik (specific area of 100 m2 g−1), which was partly dehydroxylated at 500 °C under high vacuum (10-5 Torr) for 15 h. Pt(acac)2, BuLi in hexane, Sn(Bu)4 and Ge(Bu)4 were purchased from Aldrich. Gas-phase analyses were performed on a Hewlett-Packard 5890 series II gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and an Al2O3/KCl on fused silica column (50 m × 0.32 mm). Elemental analyses were performed by the Mikroanalytisches Labor Pascher, Remagen, Germany. IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer by using a DRIFT cell equipped with CaF2 windows. The samples were prepared under Ar within a glove-box. Typically, 64 scans were accumulated for each spectrum (resolution 4 cm-1). Solid-state NMR spectra were acquired on Bruker Avance 500 and Bruker Avance III 800 spectrometers (1H: 800.13 MHz,). For 1H NMR experiments (18.8 T), the spinning frequency was 20 kHz, the recycle delay was 10 s, and 16 scans were collected using a 90° pulse excitation of 2.25 μs. The 13C CP-MAS NMR spectrum was obtained at 11.74 T using the CP-MAS pulse sequence and a high power 1H decoupling at a RF field amplitude of 70 kHz. 1H-1H Double Quantum Magic-Angle Spinning spectra were acquired at 20 kHz spinning speed using the R122 5 symmetry-based recoupling scheme [38] applied for 200 μs at an RF field strength of 40 kHz. The recycle delay was set to 10 s and 16 transients were added for each of the 300 t1 increments. Chemical shifts are given in ppm with respect to TMS as external reference for 1H and 13C. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations were carried out on a Philips CM120 instrument (localised at Centre Technologique des Microstructures, Université Claude Bernard, Lyon 1) with an acceleration voltage up to 120 kV. The particle size distribution was obtained from TEM pictures calculating the surface average particle diameter from dp = Σnidi 3/Σnidi 2. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms of samples were obtained using a volumetric adsorption analyzer (ASAP2020) at −196 °C (77 K). Before the adsorption analysis, the samples were degassed for 3 h at 200 °C. The O2/H2 titration has been performed according to published procedure [39] using a Belcat B device from BEL Japan. After reduction in H2 at 400 °C, the experiment was conducted at 80 °C. The dispersion in the monometallic catalyst was calculated from the value of hydrogen uptake assuming that the surface stoichiometry of the irreversibly chemisorbed hydrogen is unity. The average particle size of platinum was calculated from the dispersion values, assuming cubic shapes for the platinum particles. 2.2 Grafting of Pt(acac)2 on alumina and characterisation of Pt/Al2O3 A solution of 0.116 g de Pt(acac)2 (Aldrich) in 10 ml of toluene was added to 2.9 g of γ-Al2O3-(500). After stirring the suspension overnight at room temperature, the solvent was distillated and the material dried under high vacuum (10−5 mbar). The solid was next calcinated at 400 °C under synthetic air and reduced under hydrogen at 550 °C for 4 h (heating rate 1 °C/min). Elemental analysis: 2 wt%Pt. 2.3 Preparation and characterisation of Li-Al2O3 A solution of 1 mL de n-butyl lithium (Aldrich) (2 M in cyclohexane) in 10 ml of cyclohexane was added to 3 g of Al2O3-500. After stirring the suspension overnight at room temperature, the solvent was washed 3 times before distillation under high vacuum (10−5 mbar). Elemental analysis: 2.8 wt%Li. 2.4 Grafting of Pt(acac)2 on Li-Al2O3) and characterisation of Pt/Li-Al2O3 A solution of 0.115 g de Pt(C5H7O2)2 (Aldrich) in 10 ml of toluene was added to 2.9 g of Li2.8%-Al2O3-(500). After stirring the suspension overnight at room temperature, the solvent was distillated and the material dried under high vacuum (10−5 mbar). The solid was next calcinated at 400 °C under air and reduced under hydrogen at 550 °C for 4 h (heating rate 1 °C/min). Elemental analysis: 2 wt%Pt and 2.8 wt%Li 2.5 Preparation and characterisation of PtSn/Li-Al2O3 In double schlenck, 1.2 g of Pt2%/Li2.8%-Al2O3 was suspended in 5 mL heptane. Then, a solution of 20 μL of Sn(C4H9)4 (Aldrich) dissolved in 15 mL heptane was added. After freezing of the liquid in liquid nitrogen and evacuation of argon, 500 Torr of H2 was introduced. The solution was stirred for 24 h at 80 °C. The solid was then washed 3 times with heptane before distillation under high vacuum (10−5 mbar). The material was finally reduced under hydrogen for 2 h at 550 °C (heating rate 1 °C/min). Elemental analysis: 2 wt%Pt, 2.8 wt%Li, 1.32 wt%Sn. 2.6 Preparation of PtGe/Li-Al2O3 In double schlenck, 0.9 g of Pt/Li-Al2O3 was suspended in 5 mL heptane. Then, a solution of 12 μL of HGe(C4H9)3 (Aldrich) dissolved in 15 mL heptane was added. After freezing of the liquid in liquid nitrogen and evacuation, 500 Torr of H2 was introduced. The solution was stirred for 24 h at 80 °C. Next the solid was washed 3 times with heptane before distillation under high vacuum (10−5 mbar). The material was finally reduced under hydrogen for 2 h at 550 °C (heating rate 1 °C/min). Elemental analysis: 2 wt%Pt, 2.8 wt%Li, 0.8 wt%Ge. 2.7 Catalyst evaluation The solid catalyst was charged using a glove box, into a stainless steel ½’ cylindrical reactor which can be isolated from atmosphere. Stainless steel inserts were employed in order to reduce the dead volume in the reactor. After connection to the gas lines and purge of tubes, the catalyst was reduced at 550 °C under 10 ccm a flow for 1 h before reaching the desired reaction temperature. The catalyst was next flushed with the reaction gas (without 2,3-dimethylbutane) in order to purge the reactor. Then the reaction gas was pass through a saturator at room temperature filled with 2,3-dimethylbutane. Hydrocarbon products were analyzed on line by GC (HP 8890 chromatograph fitted with an Al2O3/KCl 50 m × 0.32 mm capillary column, FID detector for hydrocarbons). 3 Results and discussion In order to leverage our previous characterisations of alumina and alumina-supported catalysts, we selected as a support a γ-alumina (EVONIK) with a BET surface area of 100 m2 g−1 that had been partially dehydroxylated in vacuum at 500 °C (Al2O3-500). Its remaining surface hydroxyl groups, with a density of about 2.0 OH per nm2 (0.65 mmol g−1), are potential sites for reaction with organometallic complexes [40]. The reaction of Al2O3-500 with a toluene solution containing Pt(acac)2 at room temperature affords a surface-modified alumina bearing Pt moieties. IR spectroscopy indicates that grafting of Pt(acac)2 proceeds at least partially on different surface hydroxyl groups (Fig. 1 ). Resolved peaks at 1400, 1530, 1580 and 1600 cm-1 have previously been assigned to δ(C–H), ν(CC) and ν(CO) for grafted and physisorbed acac ligands, respectively [41]. The presence of alkyl groups is further confirmed by ν(C–H) at 3000-2800 cm-1. However, the OH region (3800-3200 cm-1) is un-resolved, suggesting the presence of multiple interactions between the remaining AlOH groups and the surface organic and/or organometallic fragments. Elemental analysis revealed that the Pt loading was 2 wt%. 1H magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectrum of the latter material is presented on Fig. 2 a. It comprises several signals stemming from the surface Pt-acac fragments and from aluminum hydroxyl groups. For the sake of comparison, the 1H MAS NMR spectrum of the support, γ-Al2O3-500, is shown on Fig. 2b. Thus, the spectrum of Pt(acac)2 supported on alumina features a characteristic signal at 5.4 ppm, accounting for CH acac protons. From the 1H-1H DQ-SQ MAS NMR spectrum (Fig. 3 ), which reveals spatial proximities, the acac methyl groups were located in the 2.4-1.7 ppm region, as the acac CH signal at 5.4 ppm displays correlations with protons at such chemical shifts. As expected from the assignment, the methynic CH does not give rise to a self-correlation. Regarding the AlOH network signals (4.5–0.5 ppm), the doubly bridging hydroxyl signal is rather unperturbed, at about 2.2–1.6 ppm. On the other hand, the terminal hydroxyl groups are significantly affected by the grafting. Indeed, the intensity of the peak at −0.2 ppm (accounting for terminal hydroxyls on tetracoordinated aluminum centers) [42] is markedly lower compared to that of the pristine sample (Fig. 2a). This indicates that reaction occurred with these sites. Interestingly, a new rather sharp signal at 1.1 ppm is now observed. This could be due to Pt-coordinated AlOH group, for which the bonding on the metal would induces a 1 ppm increase of the chemical shift. In addition, weak signals are detected at high chemical shifts (about 7 ppm), which are assigned to physisorbed by-products originating from the grafting reaction, in agreement with observation on the IR spectrum. The 13C CP (Cross Polarization) MAS NMR spectrum (Fig. 4 ) comprises peaks accounting for Pt-bound acac groups, at 184 (CO), 101 (CH) and 24 ppm (CH3), which compares well with the data for Pt(acac)2 (186, 103 and 25 ppm). The resulting material was reduced under H2 at 550 °C leading to supported Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (2 wt%). The DRIFT spectrum revealed disappearance of the CH fragments (Fig. A1, Supplementary information). The particle size distribution of this monometallic catalyst has been determined by TEM analysis (Fig. A2, Supplementary information). The distribution (in surface) is rather narrow with an average particle diameter close to 2.3 nm. The average dispersion of the metallic particles is then close to 45%, according to the literature [43,44]. When 2,3-dimethylbutane (DMBH) dehydrogenation is performed over Pt/Al2O3 in a dynamic flow reactor (200 mg Pt/Al2O3, T = 500 °C, Ptotal = 1 bar, PDMBH = 350 mbar and flow rate = 10 ml/min), the reaction gives an initial maximal conversion of 28% before decreasing to 18% in 30 h (Fig. 5 a). The product selectivities, provided in Fig. A3 (Supplementary information), are mainly branched hexenes (42.1%), branched hexanes (24.4%) and methane (10.7%). The minor products are composed of benzene, pentanes, pentenes, butanes, butenes, propane, propene and ethane (See Table A1, Supplementary information). The formation of isopentene and methane can be explained by CH activation of DMBH followed by γ-H activation on adjacent platinum site and de-insertion of carbene (Scheme 1 ) [45–48]. The main unsaturated acyclic C6 components are DMBs with a fairly high relative selectivity (69.6%, DMB-2/DMB-1 = 2.06) obtained by dehydrogenation of dimethylbutane accompanied with isohexenes (or methylpentenes) 10.5%, neohexene 10.4% and dimethybutadiene 9.5% (See Table 1 and Fig. A4, Supplementary information). The formation of neohexene and methylpentenes is due to isomerisation reaction on the acidic site of alumina [49]. Benzene is a result of aromatisation of DMBD either on acidic sites of alumina [50] or on platinum surface [51]. This reaction induces the formation of coke, which explains the deactivation of the catalyst. The formation of hexane isomers and lighter compounds is due to isomerisation and cracking reaction occuring on the acidic sites of alumina [52], known to be able to dehydrogenate and crack alkane [53,54]. These results are confirmed by a blank reaction with alumina alone under the same reaction conditions (Fig. A5, Supplementary information). We observe that the conversion of dimethyl-butane (DMBH) is 14%, and the products are propane 39.9%, methane 21.5%, hexenes 9.3%, ethane 6.6%, butanes 7.6%, pentenes 4.2%, pentanes 3.6%, hexanes 3.5%, dimethylbutadiene 1.5% and traces of propylene and benzene (Fig. A6, Supplementary information). In order to limit these side reactions, poisoning of the acidic site by an excess of lithium has been studied. The reaction between n-butyl-lithium in hexane and dehydroxylated γ-alumina at 500 °C at room temperature gives a new support (Li-Al2O3). Li content was 2.8 wt%. Quantitative gas chromatography (GC) analysis of gas phase showed the presence of n-BuH, which originated from protolysis of Bu-Li by AlOH from alumina. DRIFT displayed adsorption bands in the regions characteristic for aliphatic CH fragments (Fig. A7, Supplementary information). Moreover, the 1H MAS and 13C CP MAS NMR (Fig. A8, Supplementary information) data confirmed the presence of alumina-physisorbed BuLi based on 1H NMR peaks at 0.1, 0.8 and 1.2 ppm, 13C NMR peaks at -1.1, 11.4, 18.5, 28.8 ppm (Fig. A9, Supplementary information) and 7Li MAS NMR signal at 0.6 ppm attributed to ≡Al-O−Li+ and BuLi physisorbed (Fig. A10, Supplementary information) [55,56]. The resulting modified Li/Al2O3 was calcinated under air at 500 °C and exposed to DMBH under the same conditions as before. No noticeable activity was observed. Pt/Li-Al2O3 catalyst (2 wt% Pt) was prepared by grafting of platinum acetylacetonate in toluene at room temperature on the new support Li-Al2O3 followed by reduction under hydrogen at 550 °C (Fig. A6, Supplementary information). DRIFT spectrum after grafting of Pt(acac)2 showed resolved peaks at 1400, 1530, 1580 and 1600 cm−1 previously assigned to δ(C–H), ν(CC) and ν(CO) for grafted Pt-acetylacetonate fragment and physisorbed Li(acac) respectively. This later salt is obtained by substitution reaction of AlO-Li with Pt-acac fragments. The presence of alkyl groups is further confirmed by ν(CH) at 3000-2800 cm−1. The reduction at 550 °C under hydrogen (Fig. A11, Supplementary information) showed the disappearance of all bands attributed to Pt complex on support. Elemental analysis revealed that the Pt loading was 2 wt%. The particle size distribution of this monometallic, supported on lithium modified alumina catalyst (Pt/Li-Al2O3) has been determined by TEM analysis (Fig. A12, Supplementary information). The distribution (in surface) is rather narrow with an average particle diameter close to 1.5 nm. The average dispersion of the metallic particles of Pt/Li-Al2O3, determined by (O2−H2)-titration, is higher (70%) than Pt/Al2O3 (45%). This result indicates the importance of particle-support interaction on particle size. When DMBH dehydrogenation is performed in a dynamic flow reactor (200 mg Pt/Li-Al2O3, T = 500 °C, P = 1 bar, PDMBH = 350 mbar and flow rate = 10 ml/min), the reaction gives an initial maximal conversion of 43% and then reaches 36% after 30 h of reaction (Fig. 5b). This improvement of the catalyst activity is related to the elevated dispersion obtained after the lithiation of the surface. The product selectivities are 51.6% in hexenes and 20.9% in methane. The remaining products correspond to a mixture of benzene, hexanes, pentanes, pentenes, butanes, propane, propene and ethane (Table A1 and Fig. A13, Supplementary information). Only traces of isomerisation of 2,3-dimethylbutane and 2,3-dimethylbutenes is observed on Pt/Li-Al2O3 compared to Pt/Al2O3 (other hexanes 24.4%). The main unsaturated C6 components are DMBs with high relative selectivity (97.4%, DMB-2/DMB-1 = 1.12), obtained by dehydrogenation of dimethylbutane, accompanied with small quantity of DMBD (Fig. A14, Supplementary information). These results indicate that the introduction of lithium on the support has virtually eliminated alkane isomerisation reactions. On the other hand, the fact that the dispersion is higher has simultaneously raised the selectivity of methane, which originates from total hydrogenolysis of DMBH. In order to overcome the former reaction, modification of the platinum surface by tin and germanium via Surface Organometallic Chemistry (SOMC) has been performed. In fact, the addition of tin or germanium may decrease the presence of adjacent platinum atoms and then overcome the γ-H activation and also the aromatisation reaction [51]. The monometallic catalyst Pt/Li-Al2O3 was mixed with an excess either Sn(n-C4H9)4 or HGe(n-C4H9)3 in heptane at 80 °C for 24 h under hydrogen. In the case of the tin-modified system, the gas production is followed by gas chromatography in order to determine the complete deposition of tin into platinum atoms after 24 h (BuH/PtS = 3, PtS = platinum on surface of particles). Elemental analysis gives 1.32 wtSn%, 2 wtPt% and 2.8 wtLi% (Sn/Pttotal = 1.09). The particle size distribution of this catalyst has been determined by TEM analysis (Fig. A15, Supplementary information). The distribution (in surface) is rather narrow with an average particle diameter close to 1.5 nm. This result confirms that the SOMC methodology does not modify the morphology of the nanoparticles. After modification the hydrogen uptake during H2/O2/H2 titration drops from 86 to 60 μmol.g−1 confirming the selective modification of the platinum surface by tin. Under the same conditions, the catalyst modified by tin has been evaluated in DMBH dehydrogenation. The corresponding conversion in function of time is presented in Fig. 5c. After an initial drop of conversion, the activity remains stable for 30 h (conversion = 34%). In presence of the bimetallic PtSn/Li-Al2O3 catalyst, the absolute selectivity in desired products (DMB-1 and DMB-2) is high (77%) compared to what is obtained with Pt/Li-Al2O3 (50.2%) (Fig. 6 and Table A1). The relative selectivity in DMBs is very high (95.8%). These results showed that the modifications of Pt/Al2O3 by both Li and Sn increase the selectivity in the desired products with high stability in function of the time. This catalyst dehydrogenates of DMBH to DMBs in high selectivity (Table 1 and Fig. 7 ). The influence of addition of Ge within the Pt particles on the catalytic performance was also probed. When DMBH dehydrogenation is performed in a dynamic flow reactor in the same conditions over PtGe/Li-Al2O3, the reaction gives an initial maximal conversion of 44% before to reach 36% after 30 h of reaction (Fig. A16, Supplementary information). The absolute selectivity in hexenes is 53.5% (Fig. A17, Supplementary information), with small amounts of methylpentenes and neohexene (Table A1 and Fig. A18, Supplementary information). This behaviour might be related to an ability of PtGe/Li-Al2O3 to perform the isomerisation of DMB-1. In addition, the catalyst seems to deactivate contrary to PtSn/Li-Al2O3. The PtSn/Li-Al2O3 catalyst demonstrates a high stability (up to 65 h, Fig. A19, Supplementary information) and high selectivity to DMBs under hydrogen. This was further investigated at different temperatures (Fig. A20, Supplementary information). Thermodynamic predicts that the conversion will decrease with the temperature (Fig. A21, Supplementary information). In fact the observed conversions are 31, 13 and 7% at 500, 460 and 430 °C, respectively. This behaviour is related to the presence of hydrogen in feed which disfavoured the dehydrogenation reaction [57]. However, decrease of temperature improves the formation of 2,3-dimethylbutenes among the unsaturated C6, which reach a value of 99.8% (Table A2, Supplementary information) at 430 °C. Nevertheless, production of methane as well as pentanes and propane increases when the temperature drops. Those compounds are originated from the γ-H activation which is favoured in excess of hydrogen and low temperature. Hydrogen was initially used to limit the cracking reaction. However, at fairly low temperature, such as 430 °C, cracking reactions are almost negligible. Hence, hydrogen was replaced by an inert gas and both the activity and selectivity are expected to be improved. Moreover, substituting hydrogen with an inert gas, for example nitrogen, will reduce the economic and safety issues. For this purpose the bimetallic PtSn/Li-Al2O3 catalyst has been evaluated under nitrogen (Fig. 8 ). At 390 °C under nitrogen the conversion value is below the equilibrium (Fig. A21, Supplementary information). At this temperature, the catalyst remains stable. Hence, hydrogen can be substituted by nitrogen with an important benefit. Importantly, the catalyst gives 100% hexenes (DMB-1 = 46.1%; DMB-2 = 51.9%). The only by-product of the reaction is DMBD (2%). The thus developed bimetallic platinum-tin catalyst on lithiated alumina presents high activity and selectivity with high stability in function of time. 4 Conclusion Controlled modification of the Pt/alumina by lithium and tin using new approach based on SOMC on metal and oxide in consecutive steps allowed to enhance the productivity, the stability and the selectivity in valuable branched hexenes, in particular DMBs. Importantly, the catalyst can operate under inert atmosphere at fairly low temperature without deactivation, providing large benefit in terms of efficiency and safety. The field of application of this new material will be extended to other alkanes in the near future, in particular to the conversion of neohexane into neohexene, an important intermediate in fragrance industry.
