J. D. LOW, C. MORTERRA and A. G. SEVERDIA Department of Chemistry, New York University, 4 Washington Place, New York, NY 10003 (U.S.A.) Summary The new technique of infrared (IR) photothermal beam deflection spectroscopy (PBDS) is outlined and measurements of IR spectra of solids over the range 3950 - 450 cm\"1 made with an interferometer coupled with a detector which senses the photothermal effect by the deflection of a He/Ne laser beam are described. PDS is a general technique and requires no sample preparation. All that is needed is a simple device to hold the sample at the IR focus. The sample must have a flat spot about 2 mm in diameter accessible to the IR and laser beams. As no sample cells per se are needed, the solid to be examined can be very large, so that selected areas on an entire catalyst pellet can be examined. IR spectra can also be recorded of adsorbed species at sub-monolayer coverage and, significantly, this can be done under the rigorously controlled conditions normal to surface studies. Adsorbents and catalysts which scatter and/or absorb IR strongly can be studied, e.g. catalysts with high metal contents, carbons and chars, and carbon-supported metal catalysts. Such materials would be impossible to examine by the conventional IR transmission/absorption techniques. Examples are given, such as spectra of CO chemisorbed on 50 wt.% Ni on carbon and of surface species on silica in a spectral region normally not accessible to IR spectro- scopy. Introduction Three decades have passed since IR transmission/absorption (T/A) spectroscopy was applied to the study of catalysts [I], and during this period the technique has become widely used and well-established as a major research tool for the study of surfaces. The many contributions of IR-T/A are well documented by the voluminous literature and numerous reviews, e.g., [2-6]. There remain, however, several types of materials to which IR-T/A cannot be usefully applied, or at best applied only with great diffi- culty, even with the enhanced sensitivity brought about by the use of 0304-5102/83/$3.00 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 312 Fourier transform (FT) spectrometers. Such materials include some sup- ported metal catalysts, especially with high metal contents, carbons and chars, and carbon-supported metals, i.e. materials which absorb IR so strongly even when fashioned into extremely thin layers that, for practical purposes, they are opaque. However, our recent experiments indicate that IR data concerning the surfaces of materials of this nature can be obtained, not with IR-T/A techniques but with one of the thermal spectroscopies which are now emerging. We briefly outline the method and demonstrate its utility in examining some opaque materials. Experimental The technique employed is IR-FT photothermal beam deflection spectroscopy (PBDS). It is an off-shoot of photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) [7] and is based on the 'mirage' detection of the photothermal effect discovered by Boccara et al. and used to record spectra in the visible range of the spectrum [8]. The spectrometer and techniques are described in detail elsewhere [9-11], but it will be useful to give a brief outline of the principles. Radiation from a broad-band IR source (Fig. 1) is modulated by passage through a scanning interferometer [12] and is then thrown on to the sample. If radiation is absorbed it will be degraded to heat (it is assumed that there is no fluorescence) and the sample warms. Essentially, this is the photothermal effect. Energy is then transferred to the gas over the sample's surface; the gas warms and expands. If the resulting pressure change (the photoacoustic effect) is detected with a microphone, PAS results.

IR-FT-PBDS apparatus. 313 warming and expansion also induces changes in the refractive index of the gas, so that a light beam passing over the sample's surface is deflected. The deflection (the 'mirage' effect [8]) can be measured with a position sensing detector, and PBDS results. The signal which is produced, the photothermal interferogram, is trans- formed by the data system (a computer with many peripherals) much as in a T/A-FT spectrometer and is plotted to yield a single-beam spectrum, S. The latter contains useful information but becomes more useful when cor- rected for 'instrument function' and is compensated for the change in the intensity of the emission of the IR source as function of wavelength. This can be done conveniently by recording the spectrum So of a carbon refer- ence, which is assumed to be a flat black absorber. The spectrum of the sample S is then ratioed against that of the carbon. So, to result in a pseudo- double-beam spectrum S/So, which is then the compensated PBD spectrum. Note that in the latter an absorption is a positive ordinate excursion, i.e. bands 'point up', away from the abscissa. Another way of compensating, which is particularly useful and applicable to surface studies in which one particular sample is subjected to a series of consecutive treatments A, B, C ..., resulting in spectra SA, Sg, Sc ..., is to compute spectra Sc/Sg, SB/SA, and so on. Effectively, the sample acts as its own reference, and spectral differences are brought out by such differential spectra. With the latter, negative bands (an absorption has decreased) as well as positive bands (an absorption has increased) may be obtained. In order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, interferograms resulting from individual 1.5 s scans are added coherently and then transformed. Typically, 800 -1000 scans suffice (measuring periods of the order of 20 min). The spectra shown were recorded at 8 cm\"1 resolution. For surface studies the sample is confined to a cell of the type shown in the largely self-explanatory Fig. 2.

Sample cell. 314 reactive gases, and so on, at temperatures up to 1000 C under controlled conditions. After treatment, the cell is filled to 1 atm with pure nitrogen, and the spectrum is recorded. Note especially that the detector is outside the sample cell, unlike PAS, where the detector is inside. As detectors for PAS cannot be cleaned effectively, serious sample contamination problems can arise with PAS. Results In presenting examples of the applications of PBDS it is useful to consider materials which are partially transmitting but can only be examined with great difficulty with T/A techniques, and materials which are opaque and cannot be examined at all. Of the former, silica is a good example. Silica transmits IR radiation quite well to about 1500 cm~1, but then there is a drastic decline in transmission. A typical transmission spectrum of a thin silica pellet (Cab-0-Sil M-5 silica, Cabot Corp., Boston, MA) is shown in Fig. 3. Below about 1300 cm\"1 silica is usually taken to be opaque. However, by using very thin pellets, a narrow transparency 'window' can be detected in the vicinity of 900 cm\"1, indicated in Fig. 3 by the arrow. Morrow and Cody [13] have carefully examined this window region and observed new bands to form when silica was degassed; the results are of substantial significance in explaining the reactivity of the silica surface. Boccuzzi et al. [14] re-examined the window region and observed absorp- tions to form on the low and high wavenumber sides of the window, i.e. on the sides of the intense silica bands centered near 1100 and 800 cm\"1, small spectral regions apparently not accessible to Morrow and Cody. Boccuzzi et al. observed various impurity modes associated with surface hydroxyl groups, and also intrinsic modes associated with the clean silica surface and related to the different strength and geometry of the surface bonds with respect to those of the bulk, thus implying that surface vibrational states not 2000 1000 cm' Fig. 3. Spectra of silica. 315 associated with adsorbed impurities could be observed with IR spectroscopy, a potentially valuable observation. It is apparent that all of the region below 1300 cm~1 is not totally opaque. However, in order to carry out IR-T/A measurements in the window region, very thin and fragile samples requiring fastidious and arduous prepa- ration and care must be used, very delicate handling of the samples is required, and exacting measurements at low IR intensities must be made; suffice it to say that such work is extremely difficult. In contrast, IR-PBDS work with silicas is relatively easy. Figure 3 also shows the PBD spectrum of silica; in this and other spectra the ordinate showing the photothermal signal (PS) is at an arbitrary scale. Note that the entire spectral range can be observed. The small trans- parency window is now a dip between the two very intense silica absorp- tions. When the silica is degassed, then the transparency in the window re- gion increases slightly, as described previously [13,14], so that the photo- thermal signal decreases slightly. Also, the absorption on the high and low wavenumber sides of the window increases slightly, so that the photothermal signal increases slightly. These minor changes occurring on the edges of in- tense bands as in the scale-expanded segment B of Fig. 4 are difficult to define and to demonstrate on a greatly reduced, printed figure because the changes are minor in comparison to the intense main bands, but become clear when spectra of the sample recorded at various stages of degassing are ratioed, as in the case of the example spectrum B/A. The latter is the result of ratioing the spectrum B of a silica pellet degassed at 350 C for 2 h against the spectrum A of the pellet after its initial degassing at room temperature (spectrum A is not shown). The silica is used as its own reference so that intensity differences are brought out. In the differential spectrum B/A, the large negative excursion is caused by the decrease of the photothermal signal Fig. 4. Surface modes on silica. B: compensated spectrum of silica after degassing at 350 \"C. B/A: differential spectrum of B and the spectrum A (which is not shown) of the silica before degassing. 316 accompanying the decrease in absorption caused by the mild degassing, as described. There is also a poorly defined band in the 850 cnr1 region and a clearly defined positive band peaking near 1000 cm\"1, indicating increased photothermal response and absorption, these corresponding to the 1020 - 975 and 860 - 810 cm~1 bands observed by Boccuzzi et al. and thought to be basically associated with coupled symmetric and asymmetric vibrations mainly localized on the outer and hence more distorted siloxane bridges of the surface. In addition, there is a minor absorption on the high wavenumber side of the intense 1100 cm\"1 band, shown as a minor positive band centered near 1270 cm~1. This absorption, which has not been observed before and the cause of which is not known, was found in all spectra of samples de- gassed to 700 C. The normally opaque region below 1300 cm\"! is also of interest be- cause that is where Si halogen bonds would be expected to absorb; there is relatively little direct information about halogen-containing surface struc- tures on silica. Tertykh et al. [15], using pellets as thin as 2 mg cm\"2, studied the 1000 - 500 cm\"1 region of silicas after various treatments, including the reaction with SiCl4 and with HF. With the former, an intense band at 630 cm\"1 attributed to the 'grafted groups' [sic] which were not further identi- fied was found. With HF, bands at 905 and 950 cm~1 respectively attributed to coordinated HF and Si F groups were observed. Fink and Plotzki [16], using thin pellets of 7 mg cm\"2, observed the reaction of silica with SiCl4 and found bands at 715 cm~1 attributed to 3Si Cl groups and at 635 cm\"1 attributed to ^Si Cl; groups. In both cases the samples were thin, and the remarks previously made about the difficulty of such work are pertinent. Figure 5 shows some PBDS results obtained after reacting silica with SiF4. Spectrum B is a scale-expanded segment of the spectrum of the silica after reaction, and shows a distinct shoulder and discrete band on the low 1200 1000 cm-' Fig. 5. Surface Si F modes.

Spectrum A of the silica before reaction is not shown; in contour it is almost identical to spectrum B of Fig. 4. When the ratio B/A is computed and plotted, the absorptions peaking near 990 and 940 cm~1 stand out distinctly and a third absorption near 860 cm\"1 becomes clearer. These closely match the Si F bands of known com- pounds [17], although at present there is not enough data to permit a dis- tinction to be made between SiF^ and SiF3 surface structures. The point to be made concerning the examples of Figs. 4 and 5 is that the results were obtained with relative ease by means of PBDS. The silica pellets, for example, were ca. 50 mg cm~2, i.e. quite thick and mechanically strong and easy to handle. Figure 6 is again concerned with silica, but a silica bearing 50 wt.% Cu. The lower trace is the PBD spectrum of a sample which had been reduced with H-t and degassed at 220 C and then exposed to 220 ton- of CO at room temperature. A minor new band (at the tail of the arrow) is due to the chemisorbed CO. The upper trace is a scale-expanded segment of the com- pensated spectrum. The clearly defined band at 2140 cm\"1 is assignable to 'linear' chemisorbed CO; a less distinct band peaking near 1860 cnT1 is assignable to 'bridged' chemisorbed CO [2, 18]. These species have been observed before; their absorptions fall in a range where the silica support is fairly transparent, e.g. Fig. 3. However, in this case, the presence of the large quantity of Cu renders the composite material literally opaque. Another example concerning a composite sample is shown in Fig. 7. The material is 50 wt.% Ni dispersed on a carbon prepared by charring cellulose. The compensated trace A is a segment of the spectrum recorded after the reduced sample was exposed to 240 torr of CO at room tempera- ture. The two negative bands in the 2250 - 2050 cm\"1 region are due to gaseous CO in the sample cell. When the CO was pumped out (spectrum B) 3000 2000 1000 cm-' Fig. 6.

(a) In the presence of 240 Torr CO; (b) after the CO pressure was reduced to 10~3 Torr. these bands disappeared, and the 'positive' band due to 'linear' chemisorbed CO [20] remained at slightly reduced intensity. It is pertinent to note that the carbon support itself was opaque over the entire spectral region [19] so that the addition of the large amount of metal does not compound the transparency problem; it is intractible to T/A methods. Discussion In view of the examples shown, IR-PBDS would seem to fulfil the ex- pectations held for the laser Raman spectroscopy of adsorbents and cata- lysts, i.e. the ability to 'see' in spectral regions where IR-T/A is 'blind' because of the opacity of the solids. Parenthetically, it is interesting to note that although Si F surface species could be detected with PBDS (Fig. 4), analogous Si Cl groups could not be observed with Raman spectroscopy [21]. In addition, good results have been observed with chars and carbons [19], other carbon-supported metals such as Fe and Pt, as well as with corrosion and other layers on the surfaces of massive objects [11, 22]. The technique is thus useful for a variety of surface studies. It should be noted that for samples which do not have to be confined in a cell in order to protect them from the atmosphere, sample cells per se are not necessary at all: all that is required is to use some utterly simple device to hold the sam- ple in place. Also, the usually tedious and time-consuming sample prepara- tion methods commonly used to prepare solids for IR examination are not needed: all that is necessary is for the sample to have a flat spot of ca. 2 mm diameter accessible to the IR and laser beams. Further, the geometry at the 'sample position' is very favourable for experimentation and very large objects can be examined. It must be pointed out, however, that the results, which have been very good indeed, have so far been qualitative in nature. There are some actual and potential problems of varying degrees of severity with PBDS. The simplest of these involves the obvious fact that the sample must be in contact with a gas which itself must be pure, unreactive, 319 and have suitable refractive and thermal properties. There is thus a potential contamination problem which, however, can be controlled. A mechanical problem arises because of the need to position the sample surface precisely in relation to the IR and laser probe beams in order to maximize the photo- thermal signal: if a sample is moved in order to carry out some treatment of the surface, re-positioning the sample precisely is very difficult, so that it is difficult to obtain quantitative data. Scattering can also influence the latter: PBDS is afflicted with some of the ills of diffuse reflection spectroscopy, in that particle size and shape, bed depth, packing and reflectivity influence the signal intensity [23, 24], and the effects of Fresnel reflectivity may make themselves felt under certain conditions [24]. Sample heating may cause desorption of weakly-held species [25], and, in addition, potential problems may arise from inadequate source compensation [26], photothermal satura- tion [7], and with continuous-scan interferometers, the continuous change in penetration depth [7] with wavenumber. There are thus some actual and potential problems concerned mainly with the quantitative aspects of the technique, but these seem more than off-set by the ability of PBDS to permit the examination of materials it would be impossible to study by conventional means.

        "dc:description": "The new technique of infrared (IR) photothermal beam deflection spectroscopy (PBDS) is outlined and measurements of IR spectra of solids over the range 3950 - 450 cm−1 made with an interferometer coupled with a detector which senses the photothermal effect by the deflection of a He/Ne laser beam are described. PDS is a general technique and requires no sample preparation. All that is needed is a simple device to hold the sample at the IR focus. The sample must have a flat spot about 2 mm in diameter accessible to the IR and laser beams. As no sample cells per se are needed, the solid to be examined can be very large, so that selected areas on an entire catalyst pellet can be examined. IR spectra can also be recorded of adsorbed species at sub-monolayer coverage and, significantly, this can be done under the rigorously controlled conditions normal to surface studies. Adsorbents and catalysts which scatter and/or absorb IR strongly can be studied, e.g. catalysts with high metal contents, carbons and chars, and carbon-supported metal catalysts. Such materials would be impossible to examine by the conventional IR transmission/absorption techniques. Examples are given, such as spectra of CO chemisorbed on 50 wt.% Ni on carbon and of surface species on silica in a spectral region normally not accessible to IR spectroscopy.",
