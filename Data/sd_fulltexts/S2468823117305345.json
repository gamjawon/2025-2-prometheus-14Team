Graphical abstract The bimetallic Ni-W oxide catalyst supported on USY- Al2O3 has been prepared and converted into Ni-W sulfide, carbide and nitride catalysts. These four types of catalysts have been characterized by surface area measurements, pulsed CO chemisorption, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed reduction and pyridine infrared spectroscopy. The initial decalin reaction activity of the catalysts decreases in the order of carbide catalyst>oxide catalyst>sulfide catalyst>>nitride catalysts. The catalysts deactivation decreases in the order of: sulfide catalyst>carbide catalyst>>nitride catalyst>oxide catalyst. The initial ring-opening activity decreases in the order of carbide catalyst>oxide catalyst ∼sulfide catalyst>>nitride catalyst. The catalyst activity has relation with the metal sites, the amount of the strong Brönsted acid sites and the surface area on the catalyst. Besides these, the catalyst deactivation also has the close relation with the coke produced on the catalyst during the reaction. Keywords Ni-W catalyst Oxide Sulfide Carbide Nitride Deactivation Decalin ring opening 1 Introduction With increasingly strict regulations of the environment, the fuel with low sulfur and aromatics and high cetane number (CN) is much needed [1–3]. As technology advances, the reduction of sulfur and aromatics in fuel can be achieved by hydrotreatment and hydrocracking process [4]. Although the CN of fuel also can be improved with the reduction of sulfur and aromatics, the CN of naphthenes in fuel cannot be further increased because of the ring of naphthenes [5,6]. Especially for highly aromatic fractions, such as light cycle oil (LCO) from fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) [3]. Therefore, opening the ring of the naphthenes is necessary to improve the CN value of fuel [7]. Recently, some catalysts have been studied on ring opening of naphthenes including monofunctional acid catalyst [1,3,8–10], monofunctional metallic catalysts [3,6,11,12] and bifunctional catalysts [5,6,9,12–32]. It has been found that the ring opening of naphthenes mainly occurred on the Brönsted acid sites on the monofunctional acid catalysts. The strength of the Brönsted acid sites played a more important role than the density of the Brönsted acid sites [33,34]. The monofunctional acid catalysts showed some advantages such as easy recovery, high recyclability and low amount catalyst in heterogeneous phase [35,36]. The metal sites also played a crucial role on the monofunctional metal catalysts. In summary, at least three mechanisms have been put forward [5,37], including the metallocyclobutane mechanism, multiplet mechanism and the dicarbene mechanism. Among all the catalysts studied in literatures, the noble bifunctional catalysts showed good potential for the ring opening of naphthenes [5,6,9,12–14,16–27,29,30] due to the high hydrogenation activity on the metal sites as well as the suitable acidy for isomerization provided by the Brönsted acid sites. But the noble bifunctional catalysts are easier sulfur poisoning [6,38,39]. In this respect, typical industry Ni-W/Al2O3 sulfide catalyst is an alternative for ring opening reaction due to the high sulfur resistance [40]. However, the hydrogenation activity of the catalyst is not efficient for the reaction [40–42]. According to Moraes’s report [3], WO3 supported on Al2O3 catalysts as monofunctional acid catalysts showed low selectivity for one-ring opening products. It is also found that the yield of the ring opening products with the Ni-Mo carbide catalysts were comparable with that of the noble catalysts [6], while few studies focused on the metal nitride catalysts. It is reported that the same catalyst with different treatment process such as sulfide process or carbide process, possibly present different activity and stability [41,43]. In our previous paper, the activity of the oxide and carbide catalyst was investigated and they showed different performance on the ring opening reaction [34]. However, there are few systematic reports of the comparison of supported Ni-W oxide, sulfide, carbide and nitride catalysts. In order to find the difference of the four types of catalysts for ring opening reaction and provide the meaningful information for choosing catalysts, this work focused on the study to compare the performance of the Ni-W oxide, sulfide, carbide and nitride catalysts. The composite support of USY-Al2O3 was used, which can provide suitable acidity and mechanical property for the catalysts [44,45]. The decalin is chosen as the model reactant for ring opening of naphthenes which is more representative for the LCO fraction. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The supports were used by mixing pseudo-boehmite (70wt.%) and USY zeolites (Si/Al=42, 30wt.%). The physically mixed compounds were dried at 100°C for overnight in the drier and then calcined at 550°C for 2h in the muffle. The supports contained γ-Al2O3 (51wt.%) and USY zeolites (49wt.%) after calcination. The Ni/W phases (4.5wt.% NiO and 18wt.% WO3) were deposited by incipient wetness impregnation method with co-impregnation method of nickel nitrate and ammonium metatungstate. The oxide catalysts were dried for 10h at 100°C in the dryer and calcined for 4h at 550°C in the muffle. Different pretreatment of oxide catalyst was performed to prepare the sulfide, carbide and nitride catalysts. For the preparation of the sulfide catalyst, the oxide catalyst loaded into the stainless steel tube was treated with hydrogen at a flow rate of 80cm3/min with a 4ml/h feed of 5% CS2 in cyclohexane. The sample was heated at 2°C/min to 370°C and held for 4h, then cooled down to the 320°C for reaction. For the preparation of the carbide catalyst, the oxide catalyst loaded into the stainless steel tube was treated with a gas mixture (H2/CH4 volumetric ratio of 4) with a total flow rate of 80cm3/min, the catalyst was heated from room temperature to 700°C and hold for 2h until no carbon oxides were detected by a gas chromatography (GC 9560). The nitride catalyst was prepared under a gas mixture (H2/N2 volumetric ratio of 4) flow of 80cm3/min. The same temperature program was used on the nitride catalyst. All the samples for characterization were passivated by using 2% O2 in He (v/v) for 5h before they were exposed to air to avoid the bulk oxidation. 2.2 Catalyst characterization The specific surface areas and average pore size of all the fresh and spent catalysts were measured by the BET method. The powdered catalyst samples were analyzed by the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku D/max-2500 diffractometer, using the Cu Kα. According to the previous studies [6,46–48], CO uptakes was measured by Quantachrome Instruments (Chem BET Pulsar) to titrate the number of accessible surface metal atoms on alumina-supported sulfide, tungsten carbides and nitride. 0.2g sample (20–40mush) was used for titration by U-shaped vessel. They were obtained by pulsing calibrated volumes of CO into a He carrier and measuring the decrease in the peak size caused by adsorption. The carbide and nitride catalysts were activated in flowing gas mixture (H2/He volumetric ratio of 4, 30cm3/min) at 500°C for 2h, while the sulfide catalyst was activated at 375°C for 2h, then quenched at 30°C and purged in He flow for 1h, CO uptakes were obtained after the reduction of samples. Thermogravimetric (TG) profiles in oxidation mode for the fresh and spent catalysts were obtained to calculate the amount of coke content during the reaction. The analysis was started with argon flow under 30°C for 30min. Next, the samples were heated to 1000°C at a 10°C/min heating rate under a 100ml/min synthetic air flow. Sulfide, carbide and nitride contents of the corresponding catalysts were analyzed by element analysis (Varion EL). The Brönsted and Lewis acidities of the fresh and spent catalysts samples were analyzed by Thermo scientific (Nicolet 380) with pyridine as a probe molecule. The strengths of the Brönsted acid sites and Lewis acid sites were identified by the different desorbed temperature (250°C, 350°C and 450°C). The dispersion and size of the samples were analyzed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) analysis was analyzed by Quantachrome Instruments (Chem BET Pulsar). 0.1g sample (20–40mush) was placed in an electric furnace and heated from 100°C to 900°C at a 10°C/min heating rate. 2.3 Catalytic evaluation Decalin ring opening was carried out in a continuous flow fixed-bed microreactor under a total pressure of 5MPa at 320°C. 3g catalyst with catalyst size of 10–20mesh was loaded. The feed flow was 4ml/h with the H2/oil=1000(v/v). The constant flow pump (CM 6000) was used to pump the decalin (trans/cis ratio of 1.5) into the reactor. The reaction products were identified by GC–MS technique (7890-5975) equipped with a capillary column (HP-5MS) and quantified with a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890A). He was used as a carrier gas. The following temperature program was used for GC–MS: initial temperature 50°C holding for 5min, heating rate of 3.3°C/min to 130°C, then heating rate of 5°C/min to the final temperature of 200°C, and dwelling at the final temperature for 5min. Because of the complex reaction products, they were classified to three groups: isomers (ISO) which contain the C10 bicyclic structures (except for decalin), ring opening products (ROP) which contain all the alkyl-substituted monocyclic, linear and branched C10, cracking products which includes the products with lower molecular weight than that of decalin. The calculation of the decalin conversion, products yields and selectivity has been described in our previous study [34]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst characterization The SBET (m2/g), average pore size (nm), coke content (wt.%), CO uptakes and W/A molar ratio (A represented as the S, C and N for the sulfide, carbide and nitride catalyst) of the catalysts were listed in Table 1 . Table 1 shows that the specific surface area and pore volume of the sulfide, carbide and nitride catalyst are less than that of the oxide catalyst. The oxide catalyst shows the highest surface area while the sulfide one shows the lowest surface area. And there is no obvious difference on the specific surface area and pore size between the carbide catalyst and nitride catalyst. The surface area and pore size of the sulfide catalyst show an obvious decrease than that of the oxide catalyst. This may be attributed to the fact that the cyclohexane (the solvent for the sulfide pretreatment) cannot be taken away completely under the N2 low-temperature physical adsorption condition. Carbon monoxide uptakes were used to measure the number of surface metal atoms on tungsten sulfide, carbide and nitride. As shown in Table 1, the CO uptakes of the carbide catalyst is highest, while that of the nitride catalyst is lowest. This indicates that the number of surface active sites of the carbide catalyst is highest among all the catalyst. Note that the W/A molar ratio of the sulfide, carbide and nitride catalysts is 0.4, 2.3 and 2.1 according to the ICP and element analysis results. And the W/A molar ratio is very close to the stoichiometric value of WS2, W2C and W2N, which implies the good pretreatment process for the corresponding catalyst [6,41,42]. As shown in Fig. 1 , the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm of the series of the Ni-W catalysts shows that all the catalysts present the types of H3 hysteresis loop according to IUPAC. However, the sulfide catalyst showed less hysteresis than the other three catalysts, which is consistent with the average pore size shown in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2 , the XRD patterns of all the catalysts show broad XRD peaks of the alumina support (2θ=45.78°, 54.87° and 66.67°)and USY zeolite (2θ=10.34°, 12.08°, 15.95°, 19.01°, 20.71°, 24.05°, 27.55° and 31.99°). Other characteristic peaks are not observed on the oxide, sulfide and carbide catalysts. It indicates that these catalysts domains are small and highly dispersed on the support. However, new diffraction peaks at 40.38°, 58.18° and 73.5° for nitride catalyst can be observed, which are attributed to Ni2W3N (JCPDS: 01-89-13). This indicates that the agglomeration can be generated under N2-H2 mixture gas during the reducing process for nitride catalyst. The high-resolution transmission electron micrographs (HRTEM) of the Ni-W catalysts (oxide catalysts, sulfide catalysts, carbide catalyst and nitride catalyst) are shown in Fig. 3 . The oxide catalyst and sulfide catalyst shows the same average particle size for 6.0nm, while the carbide catalyst shows a particle size for 5.7nm and the nitride catalyst shows a particle size that for 6.4nm. The average particle size of the sulfide catalyst, carbide catalyst and nitride catalyst are in good agreement with the CO uptakes of the passivated catalysts (higher CO uptakes means lower particle size and higher dispersion [49]). Fig. 4 shows the H2-TPR profiles of the catalysts. These TPR profiles clearly showed a distinct behavior. For the oxide catalyst, there is two peaks observed at 540°C and 800°C, which should be attributed to the reduction of NiO phase and NiO-WO3 phase, respectively [50]. Meanwhile, no peak can be observed below 400°C, which implies that NiO cannot be reduced at the reaction temperature of 320°C. A broad peak is observed on sulfide catalyst at temperature range of 320°C–460°C, which might be ascribed to the reduction of WS2 [51]. The carbide and nitride catalyst have peak maximum at 470°C and 380°C respectively, which well agrees with the other researchers reports [6,42,52]. And these peaks should be attributed to the reduction of surface oxygen on the carbide and nitride catalysts. Meanwhile, the reduction temperature of the nitride passivated catalyst is lower than that of carbide catalysts, which agrees with the result of previous works on Ni-Mo carbide and nitride catalysts [43]. The sulfide, carbide and nitride catalysts show peaks higher than 600°C, which can be ascribed to the reduction of NiO-WO3 phase. Table 2 shows the acidity of the four catalysts before the reaction. Generally, the desorption of pyridine at 250°C, 350°C and 450°C was named as weak acid sites, moderate acid sites and strong acid sites, respectively [1]. As shown in Table 2, compared with the support, the oxide catalyst shows higher amount of strong Brönsted acid sites, which should be attributed to the W-O-Al phases formed by the metal oxide and proton units privileged configuration [53,54]. In contrast with that of the oxide catalyst, the strong Brönsted acid sites amount of the sulfide, carbide and nitride catalysts decrease in varying degrees. Meanwhile, the amount of strong Brönsted acid sites on sulfide and carbide catalysts showed almost no change with that of support, which might ascribe to the reduction of the NiO-WO3 phase on the sulfide and carbide catalysts during the pretreatment [34,55,56]. And the nitride catalyst shows the lowest amount of strong Brönsted acid sites which might be attributed to the coverage of acid sites by agglomeration [3]. 3.2 Catalysts activity for the ring opening of decalin Fig. 5 shows the conversion of the reaction of ring opening of decalin under the four catalysts, which can represent the catalytic activity of the catalysts for the reaction. The comparison of the initial activities of the investigated Ni-W catalysts is based on the conversion of decalin after 2h of reaction. It can be observed that different Ni-W catalysts result in a substantial difference of their initial activity for ring opening of decalin and the initial activity of the catalysts is in the order of carbide catalyst>oxide catalyst>sulfide catalyst>>nitride catalyst Actually, the strong Brönsted acid sites have been proved to be necessary for the activity of the catalysts [1,3]. Therefore, the activity of the catalysts should have close relation with the amount of the strong Brönsted acid sites on the catalysts. According to Table 2, the oxide catalyst presents the highest amounts of the strong Brönsted acid sites, which possibly lead to the high initial activity of the oxide catalysts. The initial activity of sulfide catalyst is lower than that of the oxide catalyst, which might be attributed to the lower strong Brönsted acid sites amounts as shown in Table 2. It should be noted that the carbide catalyst shows the highest initial activity, although the strong Brönsted acid sites amount of the carbide catalyst is lower than that of the oxide catalyst. It possibly attributes to the participation of the metal sites on the carbide catalyst. Actually, except for the strong Brönsted acid sites, the metal sites have been proved to be another important factor influencing the activity of the catalyst [2,5,6,17,31]. According to our previous study, the oxide catalyst had no metal site under the reaction condition [34]. So the higher initial activity of the carbide catalyst should attribute to the participation of the metal sites. For the carbide and sulfide catalyst, the similar strong Brönsted acid sites amount can be observed, but the carbide catalyst shows higher initial activity which might be attributed to the high accessible surface metal atoms and high hydrogenation activity of the carbide pretreatment [42]. The nitride catalyst shows lowest initial activity in the four catalysts, which is consistent with the low amount of strong Brönsted acid sites as well as the low amount of the metal sites based on the result of CO uptakes. 3.3 Catalysts deactivation It can be observed from Fig. 5 that the sulfide catalyst also show high initial activity and no deactivation is observed over 96h of reaction time. The carbide catalyst shows the highest initial activity and decrease gradually over 96h. However, the oxide catalyst shows high initial activity and decreases rapidly after 10h of reaction time. Also, the nitride catalyst shows the lowest initial activity and decreased rapidly after 2h of reaction time. Therefore, the reaction time for evaluating the catalysts activities for the oxide and nitride catalysts is 58h while that for the carbide and sulfide catalysts is 96h. Fig. 5 clearly shows that the catalysts deactivation decreases in the following order: sulfide catalyst>carbide catalyst>>nitride catalyst>oxide catalyst. In order to clearly show the result of the reaction, the character of the spent catalysts, including the specific surface area, the metal sites amount, the strong Brönsted acid sites amount and the pore size distribution of the catalysts after the reaction as well as the coke content on the spent catalyst have been detected and the result is in Tables 1–3 , respectively, for easy comparison. As shown in Table 1, the surface area for the spent oxide, carbide and nitride catalysts all decrease in varying degree, which might be attributed to the coke produced on the spent catalysts during the reaction. However, an opposite trend is observed on the sulfide catalyst, which should be attributed to the cyclohexane in the passivated catalyst. Besides this, the sulfide catalyst also shows the lowest surface area in the four spent catalysts. The number of the metal sites of the passivated and spent catalysts was also listed in Table 1, which decreased in varying degree for the sulfide, carbide and nitride catalysts. The coke produced on the spent catalysts during the reaction was observed by HRTEM shown in Fig. 6 . The coke content was calculated by the difference between the weight loss ratio of the spent catalysts and that of the passivated catalysts. All the four spent catalysts had coke content in varying degree. The highest coke content presented on the oxide catalyst while the lowest coke content presented on the sulfide catalyst. The carbide catalyst almost has the same coke content as the nitride catalyst. The results generally agree with the HRTEM micrographs as shown in Fig. 6. The surface areas of the oxide, carbide and nitride catalysts are higher than the corresponding spent catalyst. It should be ascribed to the coke on the spent catalyst blocking the hole of small size. No obvious change can be observed on the sulfide catalyst which might be attributed to the lowest coke content. The pore size distribution before and after reaction are shown in Fig. 7 . All the catalysts show two peaks at about 3.8nm and 6.5nm which are related to the USY zeolite and Al2O3 [44,57]. The small pore (USY zeolite) decreases while the large pore increases after reaction for the oxide, carbide and nitride catalyst. Opposite trend is observed on the sulfide catalyst, which is in agreeing with the average pore size result shown in Table 1. Compared with the strong Brönsted acid sites shown in Tables 2 and 3 shows that the strong Brönsted acid sites on the oxide catalyst strongly decreases after reaction, while it was almost no changes on the sulfide and carbide catalysts. And it decreases to some extent on the nitride catalyst after the reaction. As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 5, the surface area, pore size and initial reaction activity are similar for the oxide and carbide catalysts before reaction. However, the activity of the oxide catalyst declines rapidly during the reaction. According to the previous studies [3,34,53], the oxide catalyst should be the monofunctional acid catalyst and obey the monofunctional acid mechanism. Besides the coke produced, the supports structure and the initial amount of the Brönsted acid sites on the catalyst [1], the decrease of the Brönsted acidity amount might be another reason for the catalyst deactivation (as shown in Table 3). Based on the monofunctional acid mechanism [1], the coke was originated from the Brönsted acid sites, then probably covered the Brönsted acid sites and led to the catalyst deactivation. On the basis of the surface areas, the Brönsted acid sites but the coke content of the fresh and spent oxide catalyst, it can be assumed that the dehydrogenation intermediate produced on the Brönsted acid sites during the reaction cannot be hydrogenated and generate the coke, covering the Brönsted acid sites and then blocking the pore channel over the oxide catalyst, leading to the catalyst deactivation [39,58]. The sulfide catalyst shows high activity for over 96h of reaction time without deactivation which accords with the character of the spent catalyst shown in Table 1–3. There is almost no change observed on the coke content, the pore structure, the Brönsted acid sites amounts and the metal sites amounts between the catalysts before and after the reaction. This should be the reason that the sulfide catalyst shows the highest stability during the reaction. Compared with the sulfide catalyst, the carbide catalysts shows higher coke content, while almost no change of the strong Brönsted acid sites amount is observed for the carbide catalyst before and after reaction. This might lead to a faster deactivation for the carbide catalyst than the sulfide catalyst. The nitride catalyst shows the lowest stability over the four catalysts, which possibly caused by the high coke content and the decrease of the strong Brönsted acid sites amount. The sulfide catalyst, the carbide catalysts and nitride catalyst, as typical bifunctional catalysts, obey the bifunctional mechanism. According to the bifunctional mechanism, the dehydrogenation/hydrogenation of decalin was occurred on metal sites [2,5,6,17,31] while the isomerization and β-scission were occurred on the acid sits [1,3,34]. As reported by Samad et al., the metal sites were more easily deactivated than the acid sites on the bifunctional catalyst [59]. To measure the amount change of the metal sites during the reaction, the CO uptakes were taken and the result is shown in Table 1. Based on the result of the CO uptakes, the strong Brönsted acid sites and the coke content of the sulfide, carbide and nitride catalysts before and after reaction, the deactivation of the bifunctional catalysts used in this study might be attributed to that the dehydrogenation intermediate produced on the metal sites cannot transfer to the acid sites in time, but occur the alkylation reaction and generate the coke, which cover the metal sites and then block the pore channel of the catalysts, resulting in the deactivation of the catalysts [39,60]. The oxide catalyst, as a monofunctional acid catalyst, obeys the monofunctional acid mechanism. According to the monofunctional acid mechanism, the dehydrogenation/hydrogenation and β-scission are occurred on the acid sites for the oxide catalyst. Besides this, the dehydrogenation intermediate cannot be hydrogenated, but generate the coke and cover the Brönsted acid sites. However, for the other three catalysts, the dehydrogenation/hydrogenation is occurred on the metal sites while the β-scission is occurred on the acid sites based on the bifunctional mechanism. Since the dehydrogenation intermediate cannot be transferred onto the acid sites to produce the ring opening product, it further occur the alkylation reaction on the metals sites to produce the coke on the catalyst. In summary, the different reaction scheme for ring opening of decalin and the deactivation pathways for the catalysts are proposed in Fig. 8 . 3.4 Products distribution Fig. 9 shows the product distribution of the ring opening of decalin over the four catalysts. As stated previously, the main reactions products involving in the reaction includes ISO, ROP and CP [5,31]. It can be seen that the oxide, sulfide and carbide catalysts show high conversion while the nitride catalyst shows lowest conversion at the beginning of the reaction. The highest CP selectivity (59%) is obtained over the oxide catalyst. With the time on stream, the ROP and CP selectivity decreases and the ISO selectivity increases over the oxide catalyst. According to our previous study [34], the conversion and products selectivity were related to the strong Brönsted acid sites amount. This is well agreed with our experiment result. Based on the difference of the strong Brönsted acid sites amount between the fresh and spent oxide catalysts, it might be ascribed that the ISO cannot undergo the further reaction to produce the ROP and CP on low amount of the strong Brönsted acid sites [1]. The products selectivity almost keeps constant (about 34% of ROP, 55% of ISO and 11% of CP) during the reaction time over the sulfide catalysts. It shows the highest stability on the sulfide catalyst for the reaction, which could be further explained by the character of the catalyst before and after reaction, such as the coke content, CO uptakes and the strong Brönsted acid sites. The highest ROP selectivity (42%) can be observed over the carbide catalysts at first, implying the highest hydrogenation activity. However, the ROP selectivity decreases with the reaction time prolonging. Finally, a lower ROP selectivity (29%) on the carbide catalyst than that of the sulfide catalyst can be obtained. According to the amount change of CO uptakes and the strong Brönsted acid sites before and after reaction on the carbide catalyst, the decrease of the ROP selectivity might be attributed to that the coke produced during the reaction has covered the metal sites thus decreased the hydrogenation activity of the metal sites [39,59,60]. Both the conversion and the ROP selectivity on the nitride catalyst are the lowest in the four catalysts. However, the nitride catalyst shows the highest ISO selectivity. The lowest conversion and ROP selectivity on the nitride catalyst might be attributed to the low hydrogenation activity on the metal sites and low strong Brönsted acid sites. The highest ISO selectivity possibly ascribes to that the ISO, as first reaction products cannot be further reacted under low conversion. 4 Conclusions The four catalysts of oxide, sulfide, carbide and nitride Ni-W catalysts supported on USY-Al2O3 for ring opening of decalin have been investigated and characterized by several techniques. The result was listed below. The oxide catalyst shows high initial reaction activity and decreases rapidly. This might be attributed to that the coke produced during the reaction overlaps the Brönsted acid sites and lead the catalyst deactivation. The sulfide catalyst also shows high initial reaction activity and the highest reaction stability, which should be ascribed to the low coke content on the metal sites as well as the low amount of the strong Brönsted acid sites. The carbide catalyst shows the highest initial reaction activity and ring opening activity for decalin reaction, which should be attributed to the highest hydrogenation activity on the metal sites and its suitable acidity. The nitride catalyst shows the lowest initial activity and decreases rapidly, which might be attributed to the lowest metal sites on the catalyst and the coke produced during reaction. Among the four catalysts, the sulfide catalyst might be more suitable for the industry application because of its high reaction activity and stability.

        "dc:description": "The bimetallic Ni-W oxide catalyst supported on USY- Al2O3 has been prepared and converted into Ni-W sulfide, carbide and nitride catalysts. These four types of catalysts have been characterized by surface area measurements, pulsed CO chemisorption, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed reduction and pyridine infrared spectroscopy. The initial decalin reaction activity of the catalysts decreases in the order of carbide catalyst>oxide catalyst>sulfide catalyst>>nitride catalysts. The catalysts deactivation decreases in the order of: sulfide catalyst>carbide catalyst>>nitride catalyst>oxide catalyst. The initial ring-opening activity decreases in the order of carbide catalyst>oxide catalyst ∼sulfide catalyst>>nitride catalyst. The catalyst activity has relation with the metal sites, the amount of the strong Brönsted acid sites and the surface area on the catalyst. Besides these, the catalyst deactivation also has the close relation with the coke produced on the catalyst during the reaction.",
