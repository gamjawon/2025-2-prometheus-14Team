Box 124, S-221 00, Lund, Sweden Received 4 June 1996; received in revised form 9 September 1996; accepted 10 September 1996 Abstract Palladium supported on Si-stabilised alumina has been demonstrated to be an active and durable catalyst for the combustion of methane. Si is more effective in stabilising alumina than La or Ba when the elements are added through an impregnation technique. Multiple stabilisation with combinations of La, Ba and Si does not increase further the stability against sintering. The stability increases logarithmically with the amount of Si added (0.5-8 atomic%). The rate of sintering is not affected by an increase of the water vapour content of the atmosphere from 1 to 20 vol.%. Doping palladium with rhodium or platinum increases the activity of the catalyst for methane combustion. The high-temperature stability of pure Pd is however superior to the stabilities of the Rh- and Pt- doped catalysts. Addition of La or Ce to the Pd-catalyst increases its stability against thermal deactivation but leads to an overall decrease in activity. The activity of the as-prepared catalysts are affected by the Pd-content below a value corresponding to 5% of the monolayer capacity. Thermally deactivated catalysts show a stronger activity dependence of the Pd-content than as- prepared catalysts. The combustion reaction is first order with respect to methane and zero-order with respect to oxygen (>2 vol.% of oxygen). Carbon dioxide has no inhibitory effects on the com- bustion. The activity of the Pd-catalyst is decreased by a factor of 5 through deactivation at 1473 K for 768 h. The decrease in activity is linearly correlated to the decrease in specific surface area.

The NOx-emissions contributes to the environmental pollution in a very drastic way through acidification and by participation in the production of photochemical smog. By replacing conventional burners with catalytic devices it is possible to reduce the formation and emission of NOx by more than 90%. This effect can be attributed to the low temperature (<1300 K in most applications except in gas turbine appli- cations) of the catalyst c cxduring the combustion. At temperatures below 1300 K the formation rate of thermal and prompt NOx is vanishing low. The resulting flue- gas content of NOx from catalytic combustion is normally well below 5 ppm. Although the fundamental principles of catalytic combustion have been known for 150 years or more, we are still waiting for a major technical and commercial breakthrough of the technology in different applications. Several important factors must be addressed when designing a catalytic device for combustion. Zwinkels et al. summarise the following important items [1]. The fuel/air mixture must be ignitable at low temperatures The catalyst activity must be high enough to support the combustion at low temperatures and at high volume flows The catalyst must have a high surface area and a high temperature stability The pressure drop over the catalyst should be as low as possible The catalyst must not be sensitive to thermal chocks The specific surface area of the catalyst must be maintained at high temperatures The activity must be maintained even after high-temperature operation Methane combustion is of special interest since natural gas, which consists mainly of methane, is a common fuel used world-wide. It is commonly accepted that precious metals, and especially supported Palladium (Pd) and Platinum (Pt), are effective in the catalytic combustion of methane (e.g. [2,3]). Pd has the lowest volatility among the precious metals. At 1500 K the metal vapour pressure of Pd is less than 10% of the corresponding value for Pt [4]. On the other hand Pd is more susceptible to sulphur poisoning than Pt [5]. The presence of sulphur compounds in the flue gases may lead to severe catalyst poisoning, especially at temperatures below 673 K. The surface sulphate groups are thermally decomposed at higher temperatures and the initial activity of the catalyst is retained [5]. Flue gases from natural gas combustion will contain 0.1-1 ppm SO2, mainly due to the addition of odorant (thiophene). Sulphur poisoning is not considered to be a severe problem in catalytic combustors as the temperature normally is well above 1000 K. Pd currently also has the lowest price among the precious metals, which further emphasises the choice of Pd as a suitable combustion catalyst. At room temperature Pd exists in the form of PdO which is reduced into Pd at high temperatures. The conversion temperature depends on the atmosphere and the chemical environment, i.e. choice of carrier material and the presence/absence of other elements in the metal phase. Pure PdO is thermodynamically stable in air to a A.E AhlstrOm-Silversand, C.U.L Odenbrand/Applied Catalysis A: General 153 (1997) 157-175 159 temperature around 1000 K. Decreasing the oxygen content of the atmosphere will lower the conversion temperature. The equilibrium between Pd and PdO com- plicates the catalyst performance since PdO has a considerably higher activity than Pd. The activity of the catalyst will increase with the temperature to the conversion temperature of PdO where a sudden decrease in activity can be noticed [6]. The conversion between Pd and PdO can in certain cases lead to a oscillatory behaviour of the combustion process which can of course affect the performance of the catalytic burner. The picture is even more complicated by the fact that Pd/PdO is activated under the influence of the reacting mixture. This fact is often explained in terms of re- dispersion of the Pd/PdO-crystallites under the influence of the reactants. This phenomenon is important during the start-up of the catalytic burner. The active material, preferably Pd, is dispersed onto a cheap, stable and durable carrier material in order to increase the dispersion of the metal. Stabilised alumina is a suitable carrier which meets the demands presented above. The stabilisation is performed by addition of certain elements to the alumina matrix, e.g. Mg, Ba, La, Ce, Si etc. Several researchers have studied the stabilising effects of alkaline earth metals and rare earth metals (e.g. [7-13]). The results indicate that La and Ba are especially effective in retarding the solid diffusion processes leading to sintering and loss of surface area. The amount of stabiliser added should preferably be between l and l0 atomic%. Through stabilisation the carrier can withstand continuous operation at temperatures between 1200-1300 K without excessive sintering. Addition of Si has a similar effect on the stability to sintering. The stabilising effect of Si is attributed to the removal of hydroxide groups on the surface through silanisation [14]. The hydroxide groups play a major role in the sintering mechanism, especially under the influence of water vapour. Katator AB is currently developing a catalytic burner with simultaneous heat exchange, i.e. a catalytic heat exchanger (CHE). In this construction we will avoid excessive overheating of the catalyst through active cooling. The catalyst tem- perature is expected to be about 1000-1300 K during operation. The aim of this work is to develop an active and durable catalyst for the combustion of methane in the temperature region 1000-1300 K. Based on earlier investigations we decided to study Pd doped with other precious metals (PM-doped Pd) as active catalyst and multiple stabilised alumina as carrier. The study also contains a long-term thermal deactivation test of the catalyst. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation of carrier and catalyst The alumina was produced through a precipitation process where an aqueous solution of aluminium nitrate (2 mol/1) was made alkaline by the addition of 160 A.F. Ahlstriim-Silversand, C.U.L Odenbrand/Applied Catalysis A: General 153 (1997) 157-175 ammonia (aq). The precipitation was performed in a well-stirred vessel at room temperature. Ammonia was added in portions until the pH reached 9. The viscous precipitate was allowed to settle whereupon the clear solution was removed. The precipitate was then thoroughly washed three times with distilled water, dried at 423 K for 3 h and finally fired at 673 K for 3 h in an oven. The stabilisation was performed by impregnating the alumina with solutions of barium nitrate (aq), lanthanum nitrate (aq) and tetraethyl ortosilicate (ethanol). The amount of stabilising element added corresponded to 4 atomic% in each case. Multiple stabilisation was performed in steps, starting with Ba-treatment and ending with Si-treatment. Between the various impregnation steps the material was dried at 423 K for 3 h and fired at 673 K for 3 h in air. The catalysts were prepared by impregnating the stabilised alumina with a volume of precious metal solution (aq.) corresponding to the total pore volume of the catalyst. The metal concentration of the solutions was chosen to give the desired loading of the corresponding precious metals. The precious metal solutions were prepared by dissolving the metals (Pd, Pt, Rh and Au) in aqua regia (concentrated). Aqua regia was added in small amounts until the precious metals were completely dissolved. The concentrated solutions were diluted with distilled water. After the impregnation step the catalyst precursors were dried at 150 for 1 h and then reduced in an atmosphere containing 10 vol.% of hydrogen in nitrogen for 1 h at 1073 K. The reduced catalysts were finally fired in air for 1 h at 1073 K in an oven (Nabertherm, L3). All chemicals used during the preparation of the stabilised alumina and the precious metal catalysts were analytical grade. 2.2. Characterisation techniques Specific areas of the stabilised alumina and the catalysts were measured with an area meter (FlowSorb II from Micromeritics) by adsorption of nitrogen according to the one point BET-method. The samples were de-gassed at 623 K for 16 h prior to the measurements in flowing N2 of high purity. The pore-size distribution of the un-stabilised alumina was calculated from the total BET-isotherm, determined by ASAP 2400 from Micromeritics. The qualitative bulk compositions of the samples of stabilised alumina were determined through X-ray diffraction studies (Seifert/XRD 3000 TT). The investigations were carried out on powdered samples at room temperature over the range 0=14-36 CUK~tl radiation was used during the measurements (A=0.1540598 nm). The selective surface area of Pd was determined by chemisorption of carbon monoxide at room temperature (ASAP 2010 C from Micromeritics). The number of chemisorbed CO molecules was assumed to correspond to the number of surface atoms of Pd. Prior to the chemisorption measurements the catalyst were de-gassed A.E Ahlstri~m-Silversand, C.U.L Odenbrand/Applied Catalysis A: General 153 (1997) 157-175 161 at 573 K overnight. The catalysts were reduced in hydrogen at 623 K before the chemisorption of carbon monoxide. 2.3. Sintering experiments The sintering experiments were performed in a tube oven (Lenton) for 1-8 h at temperatures between 1123 and 1573 K in a stream of moist air. Water was added by passing dry air through two washing bottles placed in a thermostat controlled water bath. The maximum water content of the atmosphere obtained in this manner was 20% by volume. 2.4. Combustion experiments The combustion experiments were performed in a micro-reactor system under differential as well as integral conditions with respect to the conversion of methane. The reactor consisted of a tube of stainless steel (qb 10 mm) surrounded by a radiative heating element. The catalyst was placed on a wire gauze in the lower part of the reactor. The reactant mixture was led through the upper part of the reactor where the gas was preheated and then through the catalyst bed. The effect of the heating element was controlled by the catalyst temperature. Analysis with respect to methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and water vapour was performed with a photo-acoustic IR-technique (Brtiel Kja~er A/S, Multi-gas Monitor type 1302). The methane was supplied from a gas cylinder and the methane concentration of the reactant mixture could be varied between 0.1 and 5% by volume. The flowrate through the reactor was controlled with a system of flow meters. The combustion experiments were normally carried out in air, which was supplied from a compressor system. The moisture was removed by condensation whereas carbon dioxide was trapped in ascarite. The water content of the air was below 2000 ppm after the condensation. Some experiments were performed at low concentrations of oxygen respectively at high concentrations of carbon dioxide. In these cases nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide were supplied from gas cylinders. The catalyst activity was measured either at constant temperatures or as a function of temperature when the catalyst temperature was increased or decreased at a certain rate, normally between 2 and 5 K/min. The kinetic data obtained during the combustion experiments were not affected by the rate of temperature increase when it was varied between 2 and 10 K/min. The catalyst particles used in the combustion experiments were between 0.4 and 0.6 mm in diameter. The space velocity during the experiments was between 50 000 and 150 000 h- 1. A mathematic model was derived to evaluate the effects of mass transfer limitations and axial dispersion during the experiments. First-order kinetics with respect to methane and a zero-order behaviour with respect to oxygen were 162 A.F. Ahlstr6m-Silversand, C U.L Odenbrand/Applied Catalysis A: General 153 (1997) 157-175 assumed. The effects of external mass transfer limitations were negligible at the experimental conditions. The pore-diffusion limitations could be attributed mainly to Knudsen diffusion. This conclusion was experimentally confirmed by exchan- ging the nitrogen in the reacting atmosphere with helium. As the combustion rates were identical in nitrogen and helium atmosphere (0.5 vol.% of methane and 5 vol.% of oxygen) bulk diffusion was not the limiting process. The coefficient of Knudsen diffusion is only affected by the physical characteristics of the diffusing component, i.e. the characteristics of methane. The effects of pore diffusion increased with the temperature and resulted in an decrease of the effectiveness factor. The effectiveness factor during the combustion experiments were in all cases above 0.2. At temperature below 723 K the effectiveness factor was above 0.5, even for the most active catalysts. Accordingly the results were only margin- ally affected by mass transfer limitations, and only at temperatures above 723 K. The influence of axial dispersion was negligible except at very high conversions (>99%). 3. Results 3.1. Thermal sintering of stabilised Ale03 3.1.1. Study of different stabilisers Unstabilised alumina will sinter rapidly at temperatures above 1273 K. To increase the temperature stability it is necessary to retard the solid diffusion of aluminium ions in the alumina gitter. This can be accomplished by introducing certain elements in low concentrations to the alumina gitter, e.g. alkaline earth metals, rare earth metals or Si. The overwhelming majority of experimental data concerning stabilisation of alumina treat simple stabilisation, i.e. the addition of only one element to the alumina gitter. As different elements are reported to increase the stability of the alumina gitter by retarding different sintering mechanisms it is interesting to study multiple stabilisation of alumina. Sintering experiments were thus performed with alumina stabilised with Ba, La, Si or combinations of these. The as-prepared alumina had a specific surface area of 260 m2/g and a total pore volume (p/po0=0.998) of 0.40 cm3/g. The pore-size distribution had a maximum around 60 A. Prior to the sintering experiments the different samples were pre- sintered at 600 for 8 h. After sintering in an atmosphere containing 1 vol.% water vapour in air at 1273 K for 8 h, the specific surface area of the pure alumina had decreased to 85 mZ/g, as can be seen in Fig. 1. Addition of Ba or La only increased the stability against sintering moderately whereas Si had a significant stabilising effect. Addition of La and Ba to the Si-stabilised alumina counteracts the stabilising effect of Si. A.F. Ahlstrgm-Silversand, C.U.I.

Specific surface area of alumina and Si-stabilised alumina alter sintering in air at temperatures between 1123-1573 K for 8 h. Constant-time-variable temperature experiments with Si-stabilised alumina were performed to further investigate the stabilising effect of Si. From Fig. 2 it is evident that unstabilised alumina readily sinters at temperatures above 1273 K, whereas Si-stabilised alumina can sustain temperatures of 1423 K without exces- sive sintering. Constant temperature-variable time experiments were conducted to obtain data for modelling the sintering process. As can be seen in Fig. 3, there is a rather quick initial decrease in specific surface area. This initial decrease is followed by a much slower sintering process. 164 A.F. Ahlstr6m-Silversand, C.U.I.

Specific surface area of Si-stabilised alumina versus time during sintering in air at temperatures between 1123 and 1423 K. Schaper et al. have modelled thermal sintering of La-stabilised alumina using the following expression [16]: where So = Initial specific surface area (mZ/g), St = Specific surface area at the time t (mZ/g), 7 = Constant, 3.5 for surface diffusion and 2.5 for volume diffusion, /3 = Constant, Ea = Activation energy (J/mol), T = Temperature (K), R = The gas constant (8.3144 J/mol K), t = Time (s). The expression given by Schaper et. al is only valid for samples subjected to minor sintering. Fitting the expression by non-linear regression analysis to the sintering data gives an activation energy for the sintering process of 240 kJ/mol. This value is valid for both unstabilised alumina and for Si-stabilised alumina. The \"),-value is decreased from 3.5 to a value between 2.5 and 3 by the Si-stabilisation. This reduction indicates that the surface diffusion of aluminium ions is retarded by the presence of Si. Assuming the same value for 7, the pre-exponential factor/3 is decreased from 2-1011 to 3 101through the addition of Si. X-ray diffraction shows that the Si-stabilisation has retarded the transformation of 7-A1203 into o~-A1203 significantly. Unstabilised alumina subjected to tem- peratures above 1273 K for 8 h consisted only of c~-A1203 whereas Si-stabilised alumina mainly consisted of 7-A1203 at temperatures below 1473 K. The average size of the crystalline domains was around 10 nm for both unstabilised and Si- stabilised alumina after sintering at 1123 K. The average crystallite size of the unstabilised alumina was 16 and 150 nm after sintering at 1273 and 1423 K respectively. The crystallite size of Si-stabilised alumina was almost unaffected by A.E AhlstrSm-Silversand, C.U.L Odenbrand/Applied Catalysis A: General 153 (1997) 157-175 165 thermal treatment at temperatures up to 1423 K. After sintering at 1423 K the average crystallite size was still around 10 nm. The growth rate of the crystallites is rather slow at temperatures below the phase transformation temperature. When phase transformation occurs however, the growth rate is increased dramatically and the specific surface area of the sample is decreased rapidly. 3.1.2. Effect of water vapour It is commonly accepted that water vapour will increase the rate of sintering in most systems. To study the effect of water vapour we added 20 vol.% to the air stream which was led over the samples during the sintering experiments. This water content corresponds to the maximum water content of flue gases from natural gas combustion. We were unable to detect any differences between the stability of the Si-treated alumina in 1 respectively in 20% of water vapour (balance air). This observation indicates that although water may deteriorate the stability against sintering, the negative effect of water probably levels out at a very low concentra- tion. 3.1.3. Influence of Si-content To study the effect of the amount of Si we prepared samples with 0.5-8 atom% of Si. The samples were subjected to sintering at 1423 K for 8 h in air. The stabilising effect of Si increases monotony in the region studied, as can be seen in Fig. 4. The relationship between the ratio S/So and the atom% of Si follows a logarithmic behaviour. According to the results the amount of Si added should be at least 2 atom%. Increasing the Si-content above this value only slightly increases the stability against thermal sintering. 0,5~ I -- o,4 i 0,3 / 0,2 0-~ .... 0 i ..... 4 6 Si-content (atom%) 8 10 Fig. 4.

Kinetics of methane combustion The reaction orders with respect to methane and oxygen over a Pd/A1203-SiO2 catalyst were determined at temperatures between 573 and 698 K. The results show that the reaction rate increases linearly with the methane concentration (0.04- 0.4 mol/m3) whereas a zero-order behaviour could be detected for oxygen at oxygen concentrations above 0.7 mol/m3 (corresponding to approximately 1.5% by volume at 273 K). These results are in agreement with observations by many other researchers (e.g. [31). Experiments conducted with 10-20 vol.% of CO2 in the reactant mixture show no inhibitory effect of CO2. This result is in agreement with a study performed by Burch et al. [17] where methane was combusted over a Pd/A1203 catalyst. 3.2.2. Effects of doping the Pd-catalyst with Pt, Rh or Au In order to further increase the activity of Pd we doped the Pd-phase with different precious metals (Pt, Rh and Au). It is known from the literature that addition of Pt to a Pd-catalyst increases the activity for combustion of some hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide [18]. The effect of the doping may be a stabilisation of Pd in an oxidised form. Also, the re-oxidation of Pd to PdO might be accelerated during cooling due to the doping. Four catalysts were prepared by impregnating a carrier consisting of A1203-SIO2 with solutions of precious metals. The total amount of precious metals added corresponded in each case to 10% of the monolayer capacity (the monolayer capacity is approximately 10 ~tmol/m2). The relative composition of the active catalyst were 100% Pd, 75% Pd +25% Pt, 75% Pd +25% Rh, 75% Pd +25% Au. Combustion experiments were performed in a mixture of 0.5 vol.% methane in air at temperatures between 293 and 873 K. The temperature was increased linearly with time at a rate of 5 K/min. The temperature was maintained at 873 K for 30 min and then decreased to room temperature at a rate of 5 K/min. The first-order rate coefficients for methane combustion (m3/s kg) are plotted against the inverse temperature in Fig. 5, and it can be concluded that Rh-doped Pd has the highest activity of the catalyst studied. In order to avoid misleading results due to catalyst activation we used the activity data obtained when decreasing the temperature. We were able to detect a considerable catalyst activation for the Pd- and Pt-promoted catalysts during the period of temperature increase.

The effect of Rh-doping is most significant at temperatures below 673 K, mainly due to increased pore-diffusion resistance at higher temperatures. The activity of Pd is increased by a factor of 2-7 in the temperature region 573-673 by the addition of Rh. This observation is interesting since most catalytic combustors for methane ignite in this temperature region. Addition of Rh to the Pd-catalyst may therefore facilitate the start-up process. The activity of Pd in methane combustion is not noticeable affected by the addition of Au and only marginally by the addition of Pt. 3.2.3. Thermal deactivation In order to examine the thermal stability of the catalysts they were subjected to thermal sintering in air at 1473 K during a period of 4 h. It is well known that precious metals readily sinter at high temperatures which may lead to a detrimental deactivation. Some precious metals are also subjected to excessive vaporisation at high temperatures. Combustion experiments show that all catalysts, with the exception of pure Pd, were deactivated by a factor 5 or more through the thermal treatment. Pure Pd managed to withstand the thermal treatment without any noticeable deactivation. Based on these findings a catalyst for high-temperature combustion of methane (>1273 K) should be based on Pd dispersed on a carrier of Si- stabilised alumina. At lower operation temperatures Rh may be added to Pd to enhance the activity. The addition of Rh though leads to an increased catalyst cost. 168 A.F. Ahlstriim-Silversand, C.U.I.

Addition of La or Ce Addition of rare earth metals to the precious metal has been reported to increase the thermal stability of the catalyst although the initial activity will decrease. We investigated the effects of adding lanthanum or cerium to the Pd-A1203-SiO2- catalyst. The stabilisation was performed through a conventional impregnation technique and the resulting content of La/Ce was 10 times higher than the content of Pd (1 ~tmol/m2). The initial activity of these La/Ce-stabilised catalysts were only 10-20% of the corresponding activity for the untreated Pd-catalyst. After thermal deactivation at 1573 K for 8 h it can be concluded that La-stabilisation is more effective than Ce-stabilisation. From Fig. 6 it is obvious that the first-order rate coefficient of the La-stabilised catalyst only decreased by a factor two or less after a deactivation at 1573 K for 8 h. On the other hand, the first-order rate coefficient of the Ce-stabilised catalyst was decreased by a factor 7 or more through the deactivation. 3.2.5. Influence of loading of Pd It is reasonable to assume that an increased loading of precious metal also will lead to an increased activity of the catalyst. To study this aspect catalysts with a Pd- content of 0.05, 0.5 and 5 ~tmol/m2 were prepared. The first-order rate constants are plotted versus the inverse temperature for as-prepared catalyst and thermally deactivated (1473 K for 4 h) catalyst in Figs. 7 and 8. As can be observed in Fig. 7 Pd-loadings above 0.5 ~tmol/m2 do not further increase the activity of the catalyst. This can be attributed to the fact that an increased Pd-loading only leads to the formation of larger Pd crystallites, i.e. the A.F AhlstrOm-Silversand, C.U.1.

Fig. 9 shows the results from chemisorption measurements (the adsorption stoichiometry is assumed to be unity) for Pd-containing catalyst with different Pd-loadings. The dispersion of Pd decreases from 40% to less than 2% when the Pd-loading was increased from 0.05 to 5 ~tmol/m2. A similar phenomenon has been observed for Pt-AleO3-catalyst containing above 0.5 wt.% of Pt [19]. 170 A.F. Ahlstr6m-Silversand, C.U.I.

Pd-dispersion on SIO2-A1203 versus the Pd-loading. Thermal deactivation leads to an increased dependence of the Pd-loading on the activity. This observation leads to the conclusion that catalysts with a low content of Pd are more sensitive to thermal deactivation than those with a high content. When the catalyst contains only a small amount of metal the catalyst is more sensitive to deactivation through vaporisation. 3.3. Effects of long-term deactivation at 1473 K 3.3.1. Decrease in activity A long-term thermal deactivation test at 1473 K was performed with the Pd/ A1203-SiO2-catalyst. The activity was measured at different times during the course of deactivation. The ratio between the time dependent activity and the initial activity is plotted versus the time in Fig. 10. The activity ratio considered here is the average ratio between 673 and 873 K. From the figure it is evident that the initial deactivation is rapid. After a deactivation period of 100 h the activity has decreased by 75% compared to the initial activity. After a deactivation time of 768 h the activity ratio has decreased to 10-15% of the initial ratio. Prolonged thermal deactivation at 1473 K is rather a tough test for a combustion catalyst to be used in a real application. The observed deactivation will demand a higher pre-heat temperatures of the catalyst during the start-up of the catalytic burner. During constant operation however, the effects of deactivation will hardly be noticeable as the catalytic reactions in the catalytic burner then are severely limited by the rate of external mass transfer. 3.3.2. BET-area as a function of time The BET-area of the catalyst was determined at different times during the deactivation process.

Discussion Multiple stabilisation of alumina through repeated impregnation with solutions of different stabilisers is not an effective way to add increased stability to the alumina according to our results. The basic idea of multiple stabilisation was to 172 A.E Ahlstr6m-Silversand, C.U.I. Odenbrand/Applied Catalysis A: General 153 (1997) 157-175 retard different sintering mechanisms simultaneously. According to Arai and Machida [15] La is effective in retarding surface diffusion of aluminium ions whereas Ba effectively increases the stability against bulk diffusion of aluminium ions. Si produces a glassy surface layer on alumina and thereby retards the re- crystallisation necessary to convert \",/-alumina into a-alumina. Stabilisation with Si is superior to stabilisation with La or Ba, according to the results. Adding La or Ba to the Si-stabilised alumina deteriorates the stabilising effect of Si. Fitting the sintering data to the model proposed by Schaper et al. show that the Si-addition has a retarding effect of the solid diffusion of aluminium ions. Compared to unstabilised alumina the Si-addition decreases the diffusion rate by a factor 10 at temperatures below 1473 K. At still higher temperatures the sintering proceeds quickly through re-crystallisation even in the presence of Si. By introducing a term for the observed asymptotic value of the specific surface area at infinite time it is also possible to treat excessive sintering. Such a model has been used by Bartholomew to explain sintering phenomena of supported metals [20]. The stabilising effect of Ba and La may perhaps be enhanced if these elements are incorporated into the alumina gitter during the precipitation of the aluminium hydroxide. The best stabilising effect of Ba is achieved through hydrolysis of a composite alkoxide, as described by Arai and Machida [15]. The stabilising effect of Si increases logarithmically with the Si-content between 0.5 and 8 atom%. According to Beguin et al. the number of surface hydroxide groups on alumina is decreased through silanisation [ 14]. The surface hydroxide groups play an essential role during sintering in the presence of water vapour. The effect of water vapour apparently levels out at a low concentration. We were unable to notice any differences between sintering in the presence 1 and 20 vol.% of water vapour. The catalysts were prepared with solutions containing chlorine. It is therefore reasonable to believe that there is an inhibitory effect of chloride species since chloride is known to be a catalyst poison on metal catalysts [e.g. [21], [22] ]. Simone et al. found that catalyst prepared from Pd(NO3)2 gave a superior activity compared to those prepared from chloride containing solutions of Pd [21]. Reduction of the chloride containing catalyst at 400 with hydrogen followed by washing with distilled water enhances the catalytic activity for methane combustion greatly. Marrcot et al. report that chloride poisons the metallic activity by the formation of stable oxide-chloride species [22]. The poisoning effect of chloride species is most serious under oxidising conditions. The poisoning effect of chloride will decay after successive oxidation cycles as chloride is removed by the water formed during the oxidation of hydrocarbons. The catalysts used in this study were all reduced in hydrogen at 1073 K prior to the activity tests. We were unable to notice a gradually increasing activity of the catalyst during repeated oxidation cycles as would be the result if chloride was removed successively from the catalyst. We were also unable to notice any A.E Ahlstr6m-Silversand, C.U.I. Odenbrand/Applied Catalysis A: General 153 (1997) 157-175 173 differences while washing the catalyst with distilled water after the reduction step. Consequently we believe that most of the chloride species on the catalyst were removed during the reduction which was performed at a rather high temperature (1073 K). In the case of Rh/Pd and Pt/Pd-catalysts we observed a significant time dependent activation process when the catalyst was subjected to the reactant mixture. This phenomenon is well known and has been observed by other researchers also [3]. It is important to notice that methane combustion is unaffected by the presence of carbon dioxide in the reactant mixture. In addition the oxygen dependence during combustion is insignificant provided the oxygen content of the reactant mixture is above 2 vol.%. According to Burch et al. the inhibitory effect of water during combustion of methane over a Pd/AlzO3-catalyst is severe at temperatures below 723 K [17]. The temperature of the catalyst in catalytic combustors is normally well above this value. Consequently the inhibitory effect of water will be very small in practical applications. Even if our results indicate a possibility of increasing the activity of Pd in methane combustion by doping it with Rh or Pt, the temperature stability of Pd is decreased by the addition. Consequently this doping may only be of interest in low-temperature applications, e.g. for the purification of flue gases from natural gas powered vehicles. Rh and Pt probably stabilises the palladium in an oxidised form, which is known to possess a much higher catalytic activity than the corresponding metallic form. Addition of these precious metals may also accelerate the re-oxidation of metallic Pd to the corresponding oxide during catalyst cooling. By adding rare earth metals to the Pd-catalyst we were able to increase the stability against thermal deactivation. The addition of rare earth metals however led to a significant decrease in initial activity. Addition of metal oxides with alkaline properties has been reported to decrease the activity of Pt in propane combustion [23]. It is reasonable to believe that addition of La or Ce has a similar effect on the activity of Pd for methane combustion. The stabilising effect arises from the formation of LazO3-crystallites between the metal crystallites. The La203-crystallites retards the coalescence of metal crystallites during thermal treatment, as indicated by Kato et al. [11]. The catalyst activity increases with the Pd-loading, especially in the case of thermally aged catalysts. The dependence of the Pd-ioading is not so significant for as-prepared catalysts. This effect can be attributed to the fact that an increased Pd-loading above 0.5 lamol/m2 will result only in the formation of larger Pd-crystallites in the pore system of the carrier, i.e. the precious metal dispersion will decrease with the Pd-loading. During thermal ageing there is a possibility of spreading the precious metal through re-dispersion. This re-dispersion probably occurs simultaneously with the thermodynamically implicated transfor- mation of PdO into metallic Pd. As the reduction/oxidation proceeds throughout 174 A.E Ahlstriim-Silversand, C.U.L Odenbrand/Applied Catalysis A: General 153 (1997) 157-175 the particle in a shell-progressive manner strains arise from the mismatch between oxide and metal lattice. At a certain point the particle will crack into minor ones under the influence of the strains and re-dispersion occurs, as proposed by Dadyburjor [24]. The high temperatures used during the thermal ageing (1473 K) may also have resulted in some vaporisation of Pd. The catalyst containing only small amounts of Pd are more susceptible to vaporisation than those which contain higher amounts. Long-term deactivation of the catalyst leads to a significant decrease in activity, especially during the initial phase of the deactivation. The decrease in activity correlates to the corresponding decrease in specific surface area. Prolonged thermal deactivation at 1473 is an extremely tough test concerning catalyst stability. Although the activity has decreased by more than 80% during the course of deactivation, the catalyst would still be able to sustain catalytic combustion in a catalytic device. The decrease in activity will however lead to a necessity of higher pre-heat temperatures. Thus, the conversion graph has been shifted by 70 K towards higher temperatures as a result of the deactivation. As a result of this work we have been able to identify Pd-A1203-SiO2 as an active and durable catalyst for the combustion of methane below 1273 K. This catalyst will be used in the continued studies concerning the catalytic heat exchanger. 5. Conclusions The following conclusions can be drawn from this work: The study shows that Si is superior to La and Ba in stabilising alumina at temperatures below 1473 K. The stabilising effect of Si follows a logarithmic expression between 0.5-8 atom% of Si. Multiple stabilisation with La, Ba and Si does not further increase the stability against sintering. The sintering rates were not affected when the water content of the atmosphere was increased from 1 to 20 vol.%. Doping Pd with Rh or Pt increases the activity for combustion of methane slightly. Undoped Pd has the highest stability against thermal deactivation though. Reaction orders with respect to methane and oxygen during methane combus- tion at 573-698 K on Pd/A1203-SiO2 are 1 and 0 respectively. There is no inhibitory effect of CO2 at temperatures above 673 K. Addition of La/Ce has a stabilising but deactivating effect on Pd. The activity increases with the Pd-content up to 5% ofthe monolayer capacity. A.E Ahlstr6m-Silversand, C.U.I.

The deactivation rate is very low at times beyond 100 h. The activity during long-term deactivation decreases linearly with the specific surface area of the catalyst.

Tel.: 4646182291; fax: 46 46182299 Palladium supported on Si-stabilised alumina has been demonstrated to be an active and durable catalyst for the combustion of methane. Si is more effective in stabilising alumina than La or Ba when the elements are added through an impregnation technique. Multiple stabilisation with combinations of La, Ba and Si does not increase further the stability against sintering. The stability increases logarithmically with the amount of Si added (0.5–8 atomic%). The rate of sintering is not affected by an increase of the water vapour content of the atmosphere from 1 to 20 vol.%. Doping palladium with rhodium or platinum increases the activity of the catalyst for methane combustion. The high-temperature stability of pure Pd is however superior to the stabilities of the Rh- and Pt-doped catalysts. Addition of La or Ce to the Pd-catalyst increases its stability against thermal deactivation but leads to an overall decrease in activity. The activity of the as-prepared catalysts are affected by the Pd-content below a value corresponding to 5% of the monolayer capacity. Thermally deactivated catalysts show a stronger activity dependence of the Pd-content than asprepared catalysts. The combustion reaction is first order with respect to methane and zero-order with respect to oxygen (>2 vol.% of oxygen). Carbon dioxide has no inhibitory effects on the combustion. The activity of the Pd-catalyst is decreased by a factor of 5 through deactivation at 1473 K for 768 h. The decrease in activity is linearly correlated to the decrease in specific surface area.

        "dc:description": "Palladium supported on Si-stabilised alumina has been demonstrated to be an active and durable catalyst for the combustion of methane. Si is more effective in stabilising alumina than La or Ba when the elements are added through an impregnation technique. Multiple stabilisation with combinations of La, Ba and Si does not increase further the stability against sintering. The stability increases logarithmically with the amount of Si added (0.5–8 atomic%). The rate of sintering is not affected by an increase of the water vapour content of the atmosphere from 1 to 20 vol.%. Doping palladium with rhodium or platinum increases the activity of the catalyst for methane combustion. The high-temperature stability of pure Pd is however superior to the stabilities of the Rh- and Pt-doped catalysts. Addition of La or Ce to the Pd-catalyst increases its stability against thermal deactivation but leads to an overall decrease in activity. The activity of the as-prepared catalysts are affected by the Pd-content below a value corresponding to 5% of the monolayer capacity. Thermally deactivated catalysts show a stronger activity dependence of the Pd-content than asprepared catalysts. The combustion reaction is first order with respect to methane and zero-order with respect to oxygen (>2 vol.% of oxygen). Carbon dioxide has no inhibitory effects on the combustion. The activity of the Pd-catalyst is decreased by a factor of 5 through deactivation at 1473 K for 768 h. The decrease in activity is linearly correlated to the decrease in specific surface area.",
