Formula I represents the substitution of surface hydroxyl groups, resulting in enhanced Brønsted acidity of neighboring hydroxyl groups [18]. Formula II represents the dissociative chemisorption of HCl on a chlorinated γ-Al2O3 surface, leading to strong Brønsted acidity [20]. Fig. 1 Fig. 2 Chlorine content of Pt-Y/A-Cl catalysts (0.9-1.0 wt.% Pt), prepared with H2PtCl6ˑ6H2O, after different stages of the catalyst preparation.

Fig. 3 Fig. 4 Transmission FTIR spectra of the hydroxyl region of γ-Al2O3 and Pt-A-1.0Cl, with the absorption bands of the different types of hydroxyl groups indicated (a) [30,31]. The Al coordination of the hydroxyl O atom (isolated, bridged, tribridged) is indicated per band, whereas the subscript of Al indicates the O coordination number of the Al atom. For Pt-A-1.0Cl, absorption bands at higher wavenumbers disappear with respect to those of γ-Al2O3. The transmission FTIR spectra of the hydroxyl region of the Pt/Zeolite Y/γ-Al2O3 catalysts and the Zeolite Y/γ-Al2O3 composite support are provided in (b) [30–32]. The region of the absorption bands of isolated alumina hydroxyl groups are indicated in grey, and could not be assigned individually due to overlap with the band from isolated silanol groups from zeolite Y. Nevertheless, a negative correlation is observed between the intensity of the isolated Al2O3 hydroxyl groups with respect to the chlorine loading of the catalysts, confirming the coordination of chlorine to the γ-Al2O3 component in Pt-Y/A-0.4Cl.

Graphical abstract In previous studies H2PtCl6⋅6H2O or Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 were used to control the location of Pt nanoparticles in Zeolite/γ-Al2O3 composites for the synthesis of metal-acid bifunctional catalysts. Use of H2PtCl6⋅6H2O led to Pt nanoparticles located on the γ-Al2O3 binder, in a ‘nanoscale’ intimacy with zeolite acid sites being beneficial for performance in the conversion of hydrocarbons, compared to catalysts with Pt nanoparticles located in zeolite Y (‘closest’ metal-acid intimacy) obtained by use of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2. A side effect of using H2PtCl6∙6H2O was a higher NH3 uptake in NH3-TPD experiments, that suggested a higher acidity possibly affecting catalysis. In this study the effect of residual chlorine on Pt/Zeolite Y/γ-Al2O3 catalysts (0.1-0.6 wt.% Cl) was investigated by (pyridine) FTIR, NH3-TPD and n-alkane hydro-isomerization. The coordination of chlorine to γ-Al2O3 was observed and led to a higher NH3 uptake, but no effect of chlorine on the catalytic performance of the catalysts was detected. Keywords Bifunctional catalysts Zeolites Chlorinated alumina Infrared spectroscopy Alkane hydro-isomerization Pt-precursor effects 1 Introduction Bifunctional catalysts based on metal (oxides, sulfides) in combination with zeolites find application in large-scale hydro-isomerization and hydro-cracking processes in oil refineries for the production of transportation fuels and chemicals [1,2]. Besides industrial use, they are also studied for the conversion of biomass feedstocks [3,4], waste plastics [5] and for the hydrogenation of CO or CO2 towards lower olefins (C2-C4) [6,7], light alkanes [8,9] and aromatics [10,11]. The bifunctional catalysts employed for the conversion of hydrocarbons, consist of a (de)hydrogenation function and a Brønsted acid function. The (de)hydrogenation function can be performed by highly active noble metals like platinum or palladium, or more abundant, less active metal (sulfides), such as nickel, nickel-molybdenum sulfide or cobalt-molybdenum sulfide. The acid function, responsible for alkene protonation and subsequent isomerization and/or cracking, is commonly obtained by using an halogenated alumina, a zeolite or an amorphous silica-alumina support [1,2]. Zeolite based industrial hydro-isomerization processes for light alkanes are mostly performed using Pt/Mordenite as catalyst and operate at temperatures of 230-280 ˚C [12]. The catalysts typically have good long-term stability under reaction conditions, but have the downside that hampered hydrocarbon diffusion through zeolite micropores may lead to undesired cracking reactions. Alternatively, Pt/Cl-Al2O3 catalysts with relatively high chlorine loadings of 6-8 wt.% are used, that are active at relatively low operating temperatures (100-200 °C), which is favorable in view of the thermodynamic equilibrium of the isomerization reaction [12]. The downside of these catalysts is that they are highly sensitive towards sulfur and water traces in the feed and require a continuous spiking of the feed with chlorinating agents to retain catalytic activity. These chlorinating agents are converted to HCl, which leads to corrosion problems and requires to be extracted from the product stream [13,14]. Other applications of Pt/Cl-Al2O3 catalysts are in the catalytic reforming of naphtha, that takes place at operating temperatures between 425 and 525 °C [12]. Such reforming catalysts commonly also contain secondary/other metals such as Re or Sn, and have chlorine contents in the range of 0.3-1.0 wt.% Cl, yielding much less acidic catalysts than those used for hydro-isomerization processes [12,15]. According to the classical bifunctional mechanism, carbenium ions are formed by adsorption on Brønsted acid sites, that are relatively well described for zeolites, i.e. a bridged hydroxyl group between a framework silicon and a framework aluminum atom [12]. Most high surface area aluminas and silicas possess a large number of hydroxyl groups, but they have generally too weak acidity to act as Brønsted acid sites under ‘mild’ catalytic conditions (e.g. used for hydro-isomerization) [16,17]. The substitution of surface hydroxyl groups for chlorine may enhance the acidity of the neighboring hydroxyl groups on oxidic supports, and is accomplished at elevated temperatures by exposure to HCl, or chlorinating agents to be converted to HCl (Fig. 1 , reaction I) [14,18]. The high electronegativity of chlorine weakens the chemical bond between H and O of the hydroxyl neighbor, increasing the tendency for proton transfer and thus increase Brønsted acidity. In case of harsh chlorination of alumina, up to a chlorine loading of 6-8 wt.%, an AlCl3 phase is obtained at the surface, which is a strong Lewis acid. However, in conjunction with HCl an AlCl3/HCl phase may be obtained, that has strong Brønsted acid sites able to catalyze hydrocarbon isomerization reactions at low temperatures [19]. Ducourty et al. has described strong Brønsted acid sites on chlorinated alumina as dissociatively adsorbed HCl on an Al site, coordinated to two Cl atoms (Fig. 1, reaction II) [20]. Supposedly, this configuration provides the acid function of the low temperature Pt/Cl-Al2O3 hydro-isomerization processes. For the synthesis of supported metal catalysts, metal precursors (mostly inorganic metal salts) are used, that are decomposed in subsequent heat treatments, to obtain metallic or oxidic nanoparticles [21]. In an earlier study, Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and H2PtCl6·6H2O were used as Pt precursors, to control the location of Pt nanoparticles on a Zeolite Y/γ-Al2O3 (50/50 wt.) composite support [22]. Pt could be selectively deposited inside zeolite crystals by ion-exchange (pH∼5) of [Pt(NH3)4]2+ (aq), whereas adsorption (pH∼3) of [PtCl6]2- (aq) was used to deposit Pt on the γ-Al2O3 binder. After Pt deposition, catalysts were heat treated at 600 °C to decompose the metal complexes and generate Pt nanoparticles. Interestingly, the catalysts with Pt nanoparticles located on the γ-Al2O3 binder displayed a higher isomer selectivity in the conversion of heavy n-alkanes than catalysts with Pt nanoparticles located inside zeolite Y, despite the larger distance between metal and acid sites. Later, this approach was adopted for zeolite/γ-Al2O3 composites based on 1 dimensional zeolites (MOR and ZSM-22) and used for conversion of n-heptane, a relatively light feedstock, also resulting in beneficial effects for catalysts with Pt nanoparticles on the γ-Al2O3 binder, prepared with H2PtCl6·6H2O [23]. Selective deposition of Pt has also been studied on several mesoporous composite supports, and it was typically found that the performance of resulting catalysts largely depends on the nature of the acid function, while it is not very sensitive towards the location of Pt nanoparticles, provided the intimacy criterion for bifunctional catalysts is fulfilled [24,25]. However, NH3-TPD measurements in the aforementioned studies on nanoscale intimacy suggest subtle increased acidities for catalysts prepared with H2PtCl6·6H2O, compared to catalysts prepared with Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2, which is induced by traces of chlorine [22,23,26]. In this study, the effect of residual ex-precursor chlorine is studied by assessing its impact on the acidity and catalytic performance of the catalysts. The chlorine content of catalysts was systematically controlled by using different reduction temperatures and applying steam treatments. This was followed by characterization using (pyridine) FTIR, NH3-TPD and catalytic experiments under industrially relevant conditions. 2 Experimental 2.1 Composite preparation Zeolite Y/γ-Al2O3 composites were prepared by adding of 15 g of zeolite powder (Zeolyst CBV760) with 15 g of Pseudo-boehmite (PURAL SB, Sasol) to a mortar. Then, 2 wt.% (based on dry mass of the supports) of Acetic acid (Alfa Aesar, glacial, 99+%) and distilled water were added and components were mixed with a pestle for ∼5 minutes until a viscous, homogeneous paste was obtained. Acetic acid was added as a peptizing agent for the boehmite particles, to aid in mixing and adhesion at the nanoscale with the zeolite crystallites [27]. The mixture was dried overnight at 120 °C in static air followed by calcination at 550 °C for 2 h, 5 °Cˑmin-1. Afterwards, the product was crushed and sieved to obtain grains of 212-500 μm diameter and used as such for Pt deposition. γ-Al2O3 as support for Pt nanoparticles was obtained by calcination of Pseudo-boehmite (PURAL SB, Sasol) at 550 °C for 2 h, 5 °Cˑmin-1. 2.2 Catalyst synthesis 2.2.1 Pt/Zeolite Y/γ-Al2O3 catalysts with Pt nanoparticles located inside the zeolite (Pt-Y/A-NH3) 1.01 g of Zeolite Y/γ-Al2O3 particles were suspended in 300 mL Milli-Q water at room temperature and stirred for 1 hour (∼500 rpm). 50 mL of aqueous solution containing 10.42 mg of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.995% purity) was added dropwise to the suspension. After 3 hours of stirring (500 rpm), the suspension was filtered and washed with 150 mL Milli-Q water and dried in static air overnight at 120 °C. The dried sample was reduced in a flow of ‘dry’ H2 (GHSV∼3300 h−1) for 3 hours at 600 °C, using a ramp of 5 °Cˑmin-1. 2.2.2 Pt/Zeolite Y/γ-Al2O3 catalyst with Pt nanoparticles located on the γ-Al2O3 binder (Pt-Y/A-Cl) 4.00 g of Zeolite Y/γ-Al2O3 particles were suspended in 1200 mL Milli-Q water at room temperature and stirred for 1 h (∼500 rpm). The suspension was acidified by adding a 1 M HCl solution dropwise until a pH of 2.7 was obtained. 50 mL of aqueous solution containing 99.5 mg of H2PtCl6⋅6H2O (Merck, ∼40 wt.% Pt) was added dropwise to the suspension. After 3 hours of stirring (500 rpm), the suspension was filtered and washed with 400 mL Milli-Q water and dried in static air overnight at 120 °C. The dried sample was divided into fractions of 500-600 mg, and reduced at temperatures between 300 °C and 600 °C in a flow of ‘dry’ H2 (GHSV ∼3300 h−1) for 2 hours with a ramp of 5 °Cˑmin-1. After reduction at 600 °C, two fractions were submitted to an additional ‘steam treatment’ to remove residual chlorine. A flow of H2 saturated with water (PH2O =0.03 bar) was obtained by flowing H2 as carrier gas through a saturator containing water at 20 °C. Subsequently the gas was flowed over the catalysts (GHSV ∼3300 h−1) in a plug flow reactor, for 3 or 12 hours at a temperature of 530 °C (5 °Cˑmin-1), which was shown to be an optimal temperature for the (endothermic) substitution of chlorine for hydroxyl groups [14]. Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts (Pt-A-Cl) were prepared by adsorption of H2PtCl6⋅6H2O on 1.00 g γ-Al2O3 (PURAL SB pseudo-boehmite calcined for 2 hours at 550 °C), using the same procedure as for the Zeolite Y/γ-Al2O3 composite support, followed by drying in static air overnight at 120 °C, followed by reduction in ‘dry’ hydrogen at temperatures of 400 °C or 600 °C (GHSV ∼3300 h−1). 2.3 Characterization Elemental analysis of Pt and Cl was performed at Kolbe Mikroanalytisches Laboratorium using an Inductively Coupled Plasma - Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES, Perkin Elmer) for platinum and Ion Chromatography for chlorine, after sample dissolution according to standard in-house procedures. N2 physisorption measurements of the supports were conducted on a Micromeritics TriStar 3000 at liquid nitrogen temperature. The samples were dried overnight at 300 °C in a N2 flow before measurements. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of the catalysts were performed using a Bruker D2 PHASER, equipped with Co Kα radiation (λ = 1.789 Å). Diffractograms were measured from 5° to 80° 2θ with 0.05° increments and a scan rate of 0.1 second per step. Ammonia Temperature Programmed Desorption (NH3-TPD) was performed on a Micromeritics AutoChem II equipped with a Thermal Conductivity Detector (TCD) calibrated for ammonia. 100 mg of catalyst was dried in a He flow for 1 hour at 600 °C (10 °C min−1). The temperature was then decreased to 100 °C and ammonia (10 vol% in He) was adsorbed in a pulsewise manner until oversaturation. The physisorbed ammonia was removed by flowing He for 2 h at 100 °C, whereafter the ammonia desorption was monitored until 600 °C with a ramp of 10 °C min−1. Quantification of ammonia desorption was performed by integration of the TCD signal. HAADF-STEM imaging was performed on an FEI Talos F200X transmission electron microscope, equipped with a high-brightness field emission gun (X-FEG), operated at 200 keV. For these analyses, catalysts were embedded in Epofix resin, left to cure in air overnight at 60 °C, and cut to 70 nm sections using a Reichert-Jung Ultracut E ultramicrotome with Diatome Ultra 35° diamond knife. For analysis, the sections were deposited on carbon-coated copper TEM grids. FTIR (infrared spectroscopy) experiments were performed on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS5 FTIR spectrometer (32 scans, 4 cm-1 resolution, DTGS detector) using a transmission in situ cell with CaF2 windows. For each measurement, a self-supporting pellet was made of ∼13 mg of sample. The pellet was dried for 2 hours at 500 °C (10 °C·min-1) in vacuum. After drying, the pellet was cooled down to 50 °C and a vacuum was obtained of <7·10-5 mbar, whereafter a spectrum was measured. Following the drying procedure, pyridine (redistilled, 99.9 %, SigmaAldrich) was introduced as vapor at a pressure of ∼17 mbar, and was adsorbed for 30 min subsequent by 30 min of evacuation whereafter a spectrum was measured. 2.4 Hydro-isomerization experiments Catalytic experiments were conducted in an Avantium Flowrence 16 parallel fixed bed reactor setup. n-C7 Hydro-isomerization experiments were performed in stainless steel reactors (internal diameter = 2 mm) and were loaded with 25 mg of Pt/Zeolite Y/γ-Al2O3 catalyst or 12.5 mg of Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, both in a sieve fraction of 75-212 μm. The product stream coming from the reactors was analyzed using an online GC (Agilent 7890A) were the hydrocarbon products were analyzed on an Agilent J&W PoraBOND Q column, connected to an FID. Catalysts were reduced at 300 °C (2 h; 5 °Cˑmin-1) in a 25% H2/He flow prior to catalytic testing. For n-C7 hydro-isomerization the following conditions were used: a feed rate of 2.6 gn-C7·gcat - 1·h- 1, a total pressure of 10 bar and 9 molH2 ˑmoln-C7 -1 n-C16 hydro-isomerization experiments were performed in stainless steel reactors (internal diameter =2 mm) and were loaded with 50 mg of Pt/Zeolite Y/γ-Al2O3 catalyst or 25 mg of Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, both in a sieve fraction of 75-212 μm. The product stream coming from the reactors was analyzed using an online GC (Agilent 7890B) were the hydrocarbon products were analyzed on an Agilent J&W HP-PONA column, connected to an FID. Before catalytic tests, catalysts were reduced at 300 °C (2 h; 5 °Cˑmin-1) in an H2 flow. For n-C16 hydro-isomerization the following conditions were used: a feed rate of 1.7 gn-C16·gcat -1 h-1, a total pressure of 4.7 bar and 10 molH2ˑmoln-C16 -1. n-Heptane (99+%, pure) and n-Hexadecane (99%, pure) were obtained from Acros Organics, He 5.0, N25.0, H2 6.0 gasses were obtained from Linde gas. Results from catalytic tests were obtained by taking the average of two GC measurement performed at identical conditions. The calculations used for the conversion (n-C7 and n-C16), product yield and selectivity are provided in Supplementary information 1. 3 Results and Discussion 3.1 Regulation of the chlorine content Structural information on the porosity of the catalysts supports was obtained from N2 physisorption and is provided in the supplementary information (Figure S1, Table S2). To control the chlorine loadings of the Pt/Zeolite Y/γ-Al2O3 catalysts (0.9-1.0 wt.% Pt) prepared with H2PtCl6ˑ6H2O, a series of reduction temperatures and subsequent steam treatments were used. In Fig. 2 an overview is provided of the chlorine loading of the samples after their respective thermal treatment. Based on the stoichiometry between Pt and Cl in H2PtCl6ˑ6H2O and the respective atomic weights, a chlorine loading of approximately 1 wt.% is expected for 1 wt.% Pt catalysts, assuming no loss of chlorine during the synthesis and washing steps. From the measured chlorine contents in Fig. 2, it is apparent that this estimate is close to the chlorine loading obtained after drying. By reducing the dried sample using H2, chlorine was partially removed from the catalyst surface, and especially when higher reduction temperatures were used, the amount of chlorine of the catalysts decreased gradually [28]. However, to be able to completely remove chlorine from the catalysts, steam treatments at elevated temperatures were required, in line with literature [18]. Removal of chlorine by steam can be attributed to covalently bound chlorine on the γ-Al2O3 surface that is exchanged for OH groups, i.e. the reverse of the reaction shown in Fig. 1, reaction I [14]. By applying steam treatments, almost all chlorine from the catalysts could be succesfully removed. From here on, the catalysts prepared with H2PtCl6ˑ6H2O will be referred to as Pt-Y/A-(X)Cl, where the ‘(X)’ indicates the chlorine loading in weight percentage. The characterization is focused on the composite catalysts reduced in H2 at 400 °C and 600 °C (Pt-Y/A-0.6Cl and Pt-Y/A0.4Cl, respectively) and the catalysts that was steam treated for 12 hours (Pt-Y/A0.1Cl). This catalysts has a ‘baseline’ chlorine content of 0.1 wt.% that is similar to the chlorine content of the Y/A parent composite support. Chlorine loadings of 0.6, 0.4 and 0.1 wt.% correspond to surface coverages of 0.9, 0.6 and 0.2 Cl atomsˑnm-2 on γ-Al2O3, respectively. In the supplementary information Table S3, more details are provided on the platinum and chlorine contents of the catalysts used for this study. In order to disentangle the effect of location of Pt nanoparticles from the chlorine content, a Pt/Zeolite Y/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was prepared using Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 with a Pt loading of 0.3 wt.%, which will be referred to as Pt-Y/A-NH3. Furthermore Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared to study the catalytic performance of catalyst without the acid function of the zeolite and will be indicated as Pt-A-(X)Cl. The obtained composite catalyst were extensively characterized to ensure that the structural properties of the catalysts remained intact after the various thermal treatments. In the supplementary information (Figure S2), XRD diffractograms are provided of the steam treated Pt-Y/A-Cl catalysts and are compared to the parent Y/A composite support. It shows sharp diffraction peaks of Zeolite Y for all samples, indicating that zeolite crystallinity was not affected by the steam treatments. Characterization methods such as pyridine FTIR and NH3-TPD require preconditioning of the catalysts at elevated temperatures. In this case, this might influence the amount of chlorine on the catalysts and therefore, the catalysts reduced at 400 °C were not studied with these techniques, but were only tested in catalytic experiments. 3.2 HAADF-STEM images In Fig. 3 , HAADF-STEM images of 70 nm thick sections are provided, confirming that the location of Pt nanoparticles was controlled by using either H2PtCl6ˑ6H2O or Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 as precursor, according to a previously reported method [22]. The control on location of Pt nanoparticles by using this method has been studied before, using techniques that sample relatively large amounts of catalysts per measurement [29]. Histograms showing the Pt particle size distribution are provided in the supplementary information (Figure S3), and show that Pt particle sizes are relatively narrow for samples prepared with H2PtCl6ˑ6H2O despite the different heat treatments with and without steam, while use of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and direct reduction led to an higher average particle size and a slightly broader size distribution. 3.3 Characterization by (pyridine) FTIR and NH3-TPD In Fig. 4 , transmission FTIR spectra of the hydroxyl region of γ-Al2O3, Pt/γ-Al2O3 and Pt/Zeolite Y/γ-Al2O3 samples are provided. In a number of recent computational publications, Digne et al. were able to assign many γ-Al2O3 hydroxyl vibrations located on different crystallographic planes [30,31]. More ‘acidic’ hydroxyl groups, with a relatively labile H-O bond, are found at lower wavenumbers, while the isolated hydroxyl groups with more rigid H-O bonds, but relatively labile O-Al bonds, are observed at higher wavenumbers. Because the isolated hydroxyl groups are removed firstly during calcination treatments and are most easily substituted for Cl, they are considered as ‘basic’ hydroxyl groups [16,32]. From Fig. 4a it is indeed observed that some of these isolated hydroxyl groups have disappeared for the Pt-A-1.0Cl catalysts with respect to γ-Al2O3, that can be attributed to substitution with Cl. Furthermore, the H-O bonds neighboring the chlorine atoms will become more labile, and thus shift to lower wavenumbers in the IR spectrum, which might explain the flatness of the spectrum of Pt-A-1.0Cl around 3650 cm-1 compared to γ-Al2O3. A similar trend can be observed for the Pt/Zeolite Y/γ-Al2O3 catalysts (Fig. 4b), where the vibrations for isolated γ-Al2O3 hydroxyl groups dissapear with increasing chlorine loading. The spectra of the Pt/Zeolite Y/γ-Al2O3 catalysts are less conclusive due to the overlap with silanol vibrations from zeolite Y, but the trend can still be observed. Another indication for the increased acidity for catalysts with higher chlorine content can be obtained from NH3-TPD, where higher NH3 uptakes for chlorine modified γ-Al2O3 compared to unmodified γ-Al2O3 are typically found [33]. For the Pt/Zeolite Y/γ-Al2O3 catalysts in the temperature range of 100-600 °C, the amount of desorbed NH3 was higher for Pt-Y/A-0.4Cl than for Pt-Y/A-0.1Cl (Figure S4, Table S4). The difference between Pt-Y/A-0.4Cl and Pt-Y/A-0.1Cl corresponds approximately to the difference that was previously observed for Pt-Y/A-0.4Cl and Pt-Y/A-NH3 catalysts [22]. While NH3-TPD is a useful technique providing a quantitative information on acidity, the ‘classical’ method for a qualitive distinction between Brønsted or Lewis acidity is adsorption-desorption of pyridine in combination with spectroscopy [34–37]. By protonation of pyridine on a Brønsted acid site, a pyridinium ion is created, that appears as an isolated absorption band in FTIR spectra. Several studies have used pyridine FTIR to study (modified) aluminas, but have generally only observed evidence for Lewis acidity [16,34–36]. The only cases pyridinium ions were observed was for fluorinated aluminas (2-4 wt.% F) [38] or in presence of HCl [39]. In the supplementary information pyridine FTIR spectra are provided of γ-Al2O3, Pt-A-1.0Cl and Pt-Y/A-0.4Cl, that shows that only pyridinium ions were formed on Pt-Y/A-0.4Cl, that can be attributed to adsorption on zeolite Brønsted acid sites (Figure S5). 3.4 Catalytic performance in the hydro-isomerization of n-Heptane and n-Hexadecane In Fig. 5 , the results of the hydro-isomerization experiments are provided of hydrocarbons with different molecular weight for the catalysts with varying chlorine loading. The catalysts possess Pt weight loadings of 0.3-1.0 wt.% and a sub 2-nm Pt particle size as evidenced from HAADF-STEM. Earlier research has pointed out that on such catalysts, the rate of the reaction on the metal sites is not rate limiting [40,41]. The high hydrogen pressures applied in catalytic experiments will further benefit establishment of an equilibrium between paraffins and olefins [42], which is further confirmed by a close-to-identical activity for the Pt-Y/A-NH3 and Pt-Y/A-Cl catalysts. The data of n-C7 and n-C16 hydro-isomerization in Fig. 5, show good reproducibility with previous studies where Pt nanoparticles located inside zeolite crystallites had a slight negative effect on catalytic activity and was detrimental for isomer selectivity, especially for linear feedstocks of high molecular weight [22,23]. Strikingly, there appear to be no effects of the chlorine loading of Pt-Y/A-Cl catalysts on their catalytic performance: in Fig. 5c and d, the isomer yield curves are overlapping. The cracking product distribution, provided in the supplementary information (Figure S6) shows the tendency of the Pt-Y/A-NH3 catalysts for secondary cracking for feedstocks of high molecular weight, while for the Pt-Y/A-Cl catalysts an identical bellshaped curve is observed [22]. Chlorine contents of the catalysts after the n-C16 hydro-isomerization experiments are provided in Table S3, and show that a limited loss of chlorine (20-30%) occurred during a test of 8 days at temperatures between 180 °C and 300 °C. As a reference experiment, the catalytic performance of the Pt-A-1.0Cl and Pt-A-2.0Cl catalysts was investigated over a broad temperature range (Figure S7). As can be inferred from Table S5, the cracking products observed on the Pt-Al-Cl reference catalysts are not those typically observed from cracking on acid sites, but are mostly linear cracking products, pointing towards cracking on Pt sites via hydrogenolysis reactions. Further evidence for a distinct reaction mechanism on Pt-Al-Cl catalysts is obtained from the apparent activation energies, revealing similar activation energies for the zeolite based composites, but a distinct lower value for the Pt-A-Cl catalysts (Table S6). From these results it is evident that such a catalysts has no significant activity at the catalytic conditions of hydro-isomerization applied for zeolite based catalysts. 4 Conclusions In this study the effect of residual chlorine from the H2PtCl6⋅6H2O precursor on Pt/Zeolite Y/γ-Al2O3 composite catalyst was investigated. It was found that a significant amount of chlorine remained on the catalysts after reduction in H2, of up to 0.6 wt.% Cl for a 1 wt.% Pt catalysts. Characterization with FTIR revealed the coordination of Cl to the γ-Al2O3 surface while NH3-TPD revealed a higher NH3 uptake for the catalyst with higher chlorine loadings. Therefore, subtle differences in NH3 uptake between catalysts prepared with H2PtCl6⋅6H2O or Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 observed here and previous studies, are therefore rightfully attributed to the presence of chlorine. n-C7 and n-C16 hydro-isomerization experiments on Pt/Zeolite Y/γ-Al2O3 composite catalysts, with Pt nanoparticles located on the γ-Al2O3 binder and chlorine loadings in a range of 0.1-0.6 wt.%, revealed that residual chlorine had no impact on the catalytic performance of these catalysts. The coordination of chlorine on Pt/Cl-γ-Al2O3 catalysts (0.8-1.5 Cl atomsˑnm-2), did neither lead to strong Brønsted acid sites that could be detected by pyridine FTIR nor provided measurable catalytic activity in n-C7 and n-C16 hydro-isomerization experiments. Hydro-isomerization experiments with a n-heptane and n-hexadecane feedstock did result in significant differences as a result of the location of Pt nanoparticles, while no differences were observed depending on the chlorine loading of the catalysts.

        "dc:description": "In previous studies H2PtCl6⋅6H2O or Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 were used to control the location of Pt nanoparticles in Zeolite/γ-Al2O3 composites for the synthesis of metal-acid bifunctional catalysts. Use of H2PtCl6⋅6H2O led to Pt nanoparticles located on the γ-Al2O3 binder, in a ‘nanoscale’ intimacy with zeolite acid sites being beneficial for performance in the conversion of hydrocarbons, compared to catalysts with Pt nanoparticles located in zeolite Y (‘closest’ metal-acid intimacy) obtained by use of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2. A side effect of using H2PtCl6∙6H2O was a higher NH3 uptake in NH3-TPD experiments, that suggested a higher acidity possibly affecting catalysis. In this study the effect of residual chlorine on Pt/Zeolite Y/γ-Al2O3 catalysts (0.1-0.6 wt.% Cl) was investigated by (pyridine) FTIR, NH3-TPD and n-alkane hydro-isomerization. The coordination of chlorine to γ-Al2O3 was observed and led to a higher NH3 uptake, but no effect of chlorine on the catalytic performance of the catalysts was detected.",
