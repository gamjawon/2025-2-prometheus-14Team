Stobbe-Kreemers, M. van der Zon, M. Makkee *, J.J.F. Scholten Delft University of Technology, Faculty of Chemical Technology and Materials Science, Department of Chemical Process Technology, Section Industrial Catalysis, Julianalaan 136, 2628 BL Delft, The Netherlands Abstract Palladium salts of heteropolyanions, of the Keggin-series H3+ nPVnMol2_nO40, supported on silica, have been success- fully applied as catalysts in the gas-phase Wacker oxidation of 1-butene. In such catalysts the palladium reaction centre (Pd2+) and the redox component (HPA) are combined in one complex. At 343 K and atmospheric pressure a high initial yield of more than 0.16 g butanone/g of catalyst/h, in combination with a very high butanone selectivity of more than 98%, can be obtained. In the steady-state, the activity of the catalysts is more than a factor ten lower than initially, due to slow reoxidation of reduced palladium-heteropolyanion complexes. The rate of reoxidation increases with increasing number of vanadium atoms per Keggin unit. Under reaction conditions the PdHPAs are reduced by approximately five electrons per Keggin unit. DRIFT spectra of the used catalyst show that the Keggin unit is not affected by this reduction and that no oxygen is removed from the HPA. The DRIFT spectra also show that the reduction and the reoxidation at reaction temperature in the absence of water is fast in comparison with the standard reaction conditions.

Introduction To overcome the disadvantages of the classi- cal homogeneous Wacker oxidation process, such as the corrosivity of the system and the formation of chlorinated side products, various types of alternative Wacker oxidation systems have been developed. Matveev et al. [1,2] showed the oxidation of ethene to acetaldehyde in the PdSO4-HPA sys- tem to be approximately l0 times faster than in * Corresponding author.

[3] also showed that a factor of 100 can be obtained if the ratio of Pd and HPA is further decreased. The increased reac- tion rate in HPA systems results from a change in rate-determining step; in the classical chlo- ride-containing system the rate of reaction is determined by one of the stages in the reduction of the Pd(II) complex to Pd(0). In chloride-free systems, for instance with HPA, the rate-de- termining step involves the reoxidation of Pd(0) by dioxygen [1-3].

Especially HPAs of the series H3+nPVnMoI2_~O40, with n = 2 to 6, gave very good results; palladium is rapidly reoxidized by the HPAs and the reduced HPAs can be reoxi- dized by dioxygen. Matveev [1,2], Grate [3], as well as Davison [4] showed the reoxidation of the reduced HPAs by dioxygen to be rate deter- mining under Wacker oxidation conditions. For HPA systems the catalytic cycle can be de- scribed by the following reactions: Pd2 + Call8 + H20 --* Pd(0) + C4H80 + 2H+ (1) Pd(0) + 2H + + HPA ~ Pd2+ + H2HPA (2) HEHPA + 1/202 ~ HPA + H20 (3) in which H2HPA represents the reduced form of the HPA. In this article the application of HPAs of the series n3+nPVnMOlE_nO4o, with n = 0, 2, 3, as redox components in heterogeneous Wacker ox- idation catalysts is described. The HPAs are deposited on a silica support and impregnated with palladium sulfate. The catalysts have been tested in the oxidation of 1-butene to butanone and the influence of the number of vanadium atoms in the Keggin unit on the activity and selectivity is discussed. To study the existence and persistence of the Keggin unit on the silica support, catalysts have been investigated by means of DRIFT after different reduction and oxidation treatment. 2. Experimental Heteropolyacids (HPAs) of the series H3+nPVnMoI2_nO40.xH20, with n is 2 or 3, were prepared according to the prescriptions of Brauer [5] and Tsigdinos and Hallada [6]. H3PMo1204o.27H20, obtained from Merck (reagent grade), was used without any further pretreatment. The palladium salts from the het- eropolyacids were prepared according to the procedure described in detail before [7]. Pd:P:V:Mo ratios were determined by ICP anal- ysis. The degree of hydration was determined thermogravimetrically in a Stanton Redcroft TG-750 thermobalance. The heteropolyacids and the palladium salts were deposited on a silica support, viz. Davisil- 300, BET surface area 287 m2/g. Two types of catalysts were prepared from the heteropoly- acids and palladium salts. The first type consists of a monolayer of heteropolyacid supported on silica, which is, in a second step, impregnated with a palladium sulfate solution (0.02 M PdSO42H20 in 0.18 M H2SO4), as described in detail elsewhere [7]. The second type of catalyst is prepared from the palladium salts of the HPAs and consists of a monolayer of the palladium salt on the silica support. All compo- nents were deposited by impregnation to incipi- ent wetness with an aqueous solution. The load- ing of the HPAs was chosen such that a mono- layer of Keggin units was arrived at, presuming that the anions are uniformly spread over the Table 1 Catalyst codes and composition of heteropolyanions Code Real composition HPA a HPA loading b (wt%) Palladium loading (wt%) PMoI2-Pd H3PMot204o 27H20 42.5 0.2 c PV2Molo-Pd HsPV2.2Mog.804o\" 27H20 41.9 0.2 c PV3Mo90-Pd H6PV3.2Moa.804o\" 29H20 41.7 0.2 c PdPMoI2 Pd HHo.sPMoI204o 20H20 44.5 2.3 PdPV2 Molo Pdi.6H LsPV2MoI004o 21H20 42.9 3.4 PdPV3 Mo9 Pd 1.3H3.4PV2.9Mog.tO,to 21H20 40.4 2.6 a Determined by ICP and TGA analysis, P is arbitrarily set to 1. b Defined as (g HPA)/(g silica + HPA). c Palladium sulfate has been applied in a subsequent impregnation step.

Monolayer coverage corresponds to a loading of approximately 42 wt%. The catalysts were dried overnight at 343 K in air and stored at room temperature in a desiccator above cal- cium chloride. Table 1 lists the composition of the HPAs and palladium loadings of the cata- lysts as deducted from ICP and TGA analysis. In the further discussion, the catalysts will be denoted by the codes given in Table 1. Catalysts were tested in the oxidation of 1- butene to butanone in a conventional micro-flow apparatus [7]. Approximately 0.7 g of catalyst was mixed together with glass beads and loaded into the stainless-steel reactor. Catalysts were tested under standard reaction conditions (total flow of 50 ml/min, atmospheric pressure and in a temperature range of 313-373 K). The reac- tion products were analyzed by means of a gas chromatograph equipped with a 25-m capillary FFAP column (internal diameter 320 /zm). The butanone yield is expressed in gram butanone produced/g catalyst/h. DRIFT spectra of the catalysts were recorded on a Nicolet Magna-IR spectrometer 550. Sam- ples were mixed and ground with KBr and loaded into the sample holder. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Performance in 1-butene oxidation In our previous articles [7,8] we reported that heteropolyanions of the series H3+nPWnMOl2_nO4o are good reoxidants in het- erogeneous Wacker oxidation catalysts. Espe- cially the initial activity of the catalysts is high, resulting in butanone yields of up to 0.16 g butanone/g catalyst/h and butanone selectivi- ties of more than 98%. Fig. 1 shows the butanone yield and selectiv- ity as a function of time for a catalyst based on the palladium salt of PV3Mo9. The catalyst shows a high initial activity and it can be con- cluded that, although palladium is present as the 180 tDa 120 .~_ >~ + 4.-i- c~ 6o ~ ~ + ~- m 0 i i L 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 Time (h) Fig. 1. Butanone yield (+) of catalyst PdPV3Mo9 at 343 K as a function of time. Feed: 1 kPa l-butene, 7 kPa H20 in air. HPA counter cation, it also acts as the reaction site for Wacker oxidation. The catalyst shows a similar activity profile as the catalysts based on the heteropolyacid, which are afterwards im- pregnated with palladium sulfate; a high initial activity is observed, which rapidly declines to a lower steady-state activity. Initially the 1-butene in the feed is completely converted with a selec- tivity of more than 98% to butanone, giving a butanone yield of 0.16 g g-~ h-t. After 0.5 h the activity starts to decline and, after 2 h, reaches a value of 0.035 g.g-t.h-i. In the next 20 h of operation the activity further de- clines to a yield of approximately 0.016 g.g- h- ~. The selectivity to butanone remains con- stant ( > 98%) over the whole period of catalyst screening. Although the performance of the PdHPA- based catalyst is comparable to that of het- eropolyacid-based catalysts, the initial butanone yield is a factor ten higher than that of the acid-based catalysts, to which PdSO4 was added. The higher activity is probably caused by the higher palladium loading and by the chemical bonding between the palladium cations and the heteropolyanions. The two types of catalysts are compared in Fig. 2, which shows the initial activity and butanone selectivity as a function of the number of vanadium atoms per Keggin unit (n). The initial butanone yield, see Fig. 2A, of the palla- dium salt-based catalysts (type 2) is a factor 3 to 250 A.W. Stobbe-Kreemers et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 107 (1996) 247-253 10 higher than the yield of the catalysts based on the acids to which PdSO4 was added (type 1). For both types of catalyst the activity in- creases with increasing number of vanadium atoms in the Keggin unit. This is due to the fact that the rate of reoxidation of the reduced HPAs increases with increasing n. Fig. 2B shows the initial butanone selectivity for the two types of catalysts. The butanone selectivity of the type 1 catalysts increases with increasing number of n. This is caused by the weakening of the acidity of the protons with increasing number of n, resulting in the sup- pression of the acid-catalyzed hydration of 1- butene to 2-butanol. The selectivity of the palla- dium salt-based catalysts is very high, viz. more than 98%. Since the larger part of the acidic protons are exchanged for palladium cations the formation of 2-butanol is negligible for these 200 150 100 50 120 (b) 100 \"'~ 80 6o 4o 20 o T Cn 0 c- o ffl o o 2 3 Vanadium atoms per Keggin unit (n) 0 2 3 Vanadium atoms per Keggin unit (n) Fig. 2.

Here the main side product is butanal, which is produced by the anti-Markownikoff addition of water to 1-butene. Fig. 3A shows the butanone yield of the two types of catalysts after 6 h on stream. For both types of catalysts the yield decreases to a lower steady-state level. The activity of the type 2 catalysts, however, is still a factor two to three higher than that of the type 1 catalysts. The decrease in activity is caused by the slow reoxi- dation of the reduced HPAs. The observed decrease in activity is higher for the palladium salt-based catalysts than for the acid-based. This is probably a result of the low HPA over Pd ratio in the PdHPA-based catalysts, e.g. for catalyst PdPV2 Mo~o this ratio is 0.6, which means that for every Keggin unit there are almost two palladium atoms which have to be reoxidized. The low HPA/Pd ratio might result into an inefficient reoxidation of A.W. Stobbe-Kreemers et al./Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 107 (1996) 247-253 251 palladium, resulting in the accumulation of Pd(0). Therefore, a HPA/Pd ratio larger than one has to be preferred. A higher HPA/Pd ratio is also preferred in the case of the homogeneous oxidation of ethene to acetaldehyde. Mateev [1,2] and Grate [3] claimed that the accumulation of Pd(0) can only be prevented by using a high HPA/Pd ratios. Table 2 shows the characteristics of several different Wacker oxidation system. From this table it is very clear that high turn-over frequen- cies for palladium can only be obtained in the presence of a large excess of redox component, preferably redox/Pd > 1000. In this case the reoxidation of the reduced HPA is no longer rate determining due to the high concentration of the redox component. Moreover, in the ho- mogeneous system the reoxidation of HPA is enhanced by the presence of VO~ species in the aqueous solution as reported by Davison [4]. The VOW- species are formed by the decomposi- tion of H3+nPVnMo~2_n under reaction condi- tions. In homogeneous systems the redox/Pd ratio can easily be altered, but in the heterogeneous catalysts this is much more complicated. There- fore, other means to improve the activity of the heterogenous catalysts have to be found, such as in adjusting HPA composition, addition of pro- moter to the catalyst, optimizing reaction condi- tions, etc. 3.2. Characterization of catalysts used Since the rate of reoxidation of the reduced PdHPA complex is rate limiting under reaction conditions, the PdHPAs are reduced during the reaction. In our previous paper [7] we showed that HPAs are multi-electron acceptors. The de- gree of reduction of the PdHPAs can be esti- mated from the total amount of butanone pro- duced in the absence of dioxygen in the feed. For PdPV~Mo9 a degree of reduction of approx- imately 5 electrons per Keggin unit was found [7], which roughly corresponds to the reduction of the vanadium atoms in the Keggin structure from V5+ to V4+ and/or Pd2+~ Pd(0). In order to investigate whether the reduction of the PdHPAs under reaction conditions leads to the destruction of the Keggin unit or to the breaking of metal-oxygen bonds, DRIFT spec- tra of the fresh and used catalyst PdPV3Mo9 were recorded. Fig. 4A shows the DRIFT spec- trum of pure PdPV3Mo9. The spectrum shows the absorption bands characteristic of the Keg- gin structure, viz. absorptions at 790 and 880 cm-l, at 957 cm-l and at 1050 cm-t, respec- tively due to vibrations of the M-O-M, M=O and P-O bonds (M represents Mo or V). Fig. 4B shows the DRIFT spectrum of the fresh silica-supported catalyst PdPV3Mo9. The char- acteristic absorptions are still present at the same positions showing that the Keggin struc- Table 2 Comparison of different Wacker oxidation systems Catalitiea [3] Matveev [3] TU Delft Industrial [3] Catalytic system HPA, PdCI2, NaCI HPA, H2SO4, PdSO4 HPA, H2SO4, PdSO4 PdC1, CuCI homogeneous, two stages homogeneous, two stages heterogeneous, one stage homogeneous, two stages Reactant ethene ethene butene ethene TOF Pd(l/s) 100 < 0.5 initial: ca. 0.01 0.1-1 steady-state: ca. 0.001 Pd:HPA or Pd:Cu 1:3000 1:100 1:10 1:100 Rate limiting red.: pd2+/Pdx.: O~ mass red.: PdPd2+ox.: 02 mass H2HPA/HPA transfer transfer Conditions 10 bar/393 K 313 K 1 bar/343 K 10 bar/393 K 252 A.W.

The P-O vibration is masked by the strong adsorp- tion of the silica support between 1020 and 1300 cm- i. Fig. 4C shows the DRIFT spectrum of the catalyst after it has been used for 16 h in the oxidation of 1-butene. This spectrum appears to be identical to the spectrum of the fresh catalyst showing that the Keggin structure has largely remained intact, The only difference is that the adsorption bands in the spectrum of the used catalysts are slightly broader, showing a diver- sity in bond lengths in the used catalyst, and the evolution of a minor shoulder at 1000 cm-l, which can be ascribed to the formation of MoO2-. Since both the M=O and the M-O-M vibrations still have the same intensity as in the spectrum of the fresh catalyst these bonds ap- pear not to be broken during the reduction of the PdHPA. These results indicate that the re- duction leads to the incorporation of hydrogen atoms in the overlayer of PdHPA on the silica surface without the removal of oxygen from the Keggin unit, forming a bronze-like structure. To study the effects of reduction and reoxida- tion of the HPA structure, PV2Mol0-Pd was subjected to cycles of reduction and reoxidation in the DRIFT-cell at 348 K in the absence of water vapour. Fig. 5A shows the change in the DRIFT spectrum during the reduction with di- e J 1400 1300 1200 1100 1000 900 800 7~ 600 wavenumber (cm-1) Fig. 4.

This figure clearly shows that reduc- tion in dihydrogen proceeds much further than the reduction under Wacker oxidation condi- tions (see Fig. 4C). During the reduction in dihydrogen, the characteristic absorption bands of the Keggin structure strongly diminish and a new peak is observed at 660 cm-l, which is assigned to reduced VzO5 species. The deep reduction clearly results in the disintegration of the Keggin structure. Fig. 5B, however, shows that the treatment in a mixture of 10 vol.% dioxygen in dinitrogen rapidly restores the orig- inal DRIFT pattern of the fresh catalyst. Com- plete reoxidation of the catalyst can be accom- plished within 5 min. At a temperature of 423 K the reduction and reoxidation are an order of magnitude faster. At both temperatures the re- duction-reoxidation cycles can be repeated at A.W. Stobbe-Kreemers et al./Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 107 (1996) 247-253 '253 least five times without loss of intensities in the absorption bands in comparison with the origi- nal catalyst. When 1-butene is used instead of dihydrogen to reduce the catalyst, the degree of reduction of PV2MoI0-Pd is comparable with the level of reduction found in the spent catalyst. Moreover, the reoxidation of this reduced HPA is very strongly inhibited. A treatment for at least 4 h at 373 K in 20 vol.% dioxygen in dinitrogen is required to reoxidize the catalyst. The slow reoxidation of the catalyst is probably caused by in the presence of adsorbed butanal on the catalyst. Davison [4] reported that the reoxida- tion of the reduced HPA is strongly inhibited the presence of butanal. This inhibiting effect may very well be the cause for the low steady-state activity of the heterogeneous catalyst under our reaction condi- tions. However, further research is still required to elucidate these phenomena. The presence of water in considerable amounts under reaction conditions may also affect the reduction and reoxidation of the catalysts. The experiments show that under steady-state conditions the activity of the catalyst is limited by the rate of reoxidation of the reduced PdH- PAs. This rate of reoxidation increases with increasing number of vanadium atoms per Keg- gin unit. DRIFT analyses indicate that the reduction with 1-butene does not lead to removal of oxy- gen from the Keggin structure. Therefore, the reduction of the catalysts probably comprises the incorporation of hydrogen atoms in the PdHPA monolayer of the catalyst, giving a bronze-like structure. Reduction of the catalyst with dihydrogen proceeds faster and also further than the reduction under reaction conditions. Reoxidation of the dihydrogen reduced catalyst proceeds fast as well. Both the reduction and reoxidation are enhanced at higher tempera- tures. Reduction of the catalyst with 1-butene leads to a degree comparable with that found under reaction conditions. Reoxidation after the reduction with 1-butene is very slow, probably due to the strong adsorption of butanal on the catalyst. 4. Conclusion Palladium salts of heteropolyanions of the series H3+nPVnMot2_n04o have been success- fully applied as active components in catalysts for the gas-phase oxidation of 1-butene. The palladium salt combines the Wacker reaction centre (Pd2+ ) and a redox component (the HPA). The activity of catalysts based on palladium salts is a factor three to ten higher than the activity of catalyst based on the separate com- ponents, i.e. palladium sulfate deposited on a monolayer of heteropolyacids. An initial bu- tanone yield of more than 0.16 g butanone/g catalyst/h is obtained with catalysts PdPV2 Mo 10 and PdPV3Mo9. Due to the fact that the strongly acidic protons of the HPA have been exchanged for palladium cations the butanone selectivity is more than 98% and the main side product iso- butanal.

Palladium salts of heteropolyanions, of the Keggin-series H3+n PV n Mo12−n O40, supported on silica, have been successfully applied as catalysts in the gas-phase Wacker oxidation of 1-butene. In such catalysts the palladium reaction centre (Pd2+) and the redox component (HPA) are combined in one complex. At 343 K and atmospheric pressure a high initial yield of more than 0.16 g butanone/g of catalyst/h, in combination with a very high butanone selectivity of more than 98%, can be obtained. In the steady-state, the activity of the catalysts is more than a factor ten lower than initially, due to slow reoxidation of reduced palladium-heteropolyanion complexes. The rate of reoxidation increases with increasing number of vanadium atoms per Keggin unit. Under reaction conditions the PdHPAs are reduced by approximately five electrons per Keggin unit. DRIFT spectra of the used catalyst show that the Keggin unit is not affected by this reduction and that no oxygen is removed from the HPA. The DRIFT spectra also show that the reduction and the reoxidation at reaction temperature in the absence of water is fast in comparison with the standard reaction conditions.
