CH4 was preferentially formed, with small amounts of C211o and C3Hg also detected. The reduction of COZ was performed by chenusorbed hydrogen atoms which were produced during the pre-irradiation of the catalyst in H2. By the bandgap excitation of NiO, electron-hole pairs are generated, HZ is oxidized by h' (conduction), and H+ is reduced by e- (valence) to form adsorbed H atoms. Further reduction of COZ by the chemisorbed hydrogen was discussed based on a reaction scheme involving an enol form of formaldehyde as the intermediate. Introduction The conversion of COZ to different species attracted increasing interest due to its chemical, energy and environmental importance. Owing to the chemical inertness of CO2, its reduction can be achieved only under severe conditions. The methanation of C02, known as the Sabatier reaction, proceeds at elevated temperatures (T> 300 C) [ 1 ]. Although CH4 is a promising feedstock for chemical production, a highly endothermic conversion of COZ to CH4 is not practical. Hence, COZ should be selectively converted to more desirable compounds by applying as little energy as possible. Ravindranathan et al. have found that C02 is selectively converted to CH4 over highly dispersed Ru/RuOx loaded onto Ti02 as a catalyst, and the reaction rate is sharply enhanced through photo-excitation of the supported material [2]. In the present study, reduction of C02 was carried out in the dark over a Ni0/ldeselguhr catalyst which was pretreated in an atmosphere of HZ under light irradiation. The main product was CH4, in agreement with results described previously [2], but very small amounts of CHg and CHa were also found. Furthermore, the thermally pretreated catalyst gave no reduction of C02 at room temperature. Such different results are attributed to the dissociative adsorption of HZ onto the catalyst during the photopretreatment of the catalyst, as discussed below. *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/92/$5.00 0 1992 - Elsevier Sequoia. All rights reserved 174 Experimental The apparatus used was a closed circulating system as shown in Fig. 1, with a total volume of 1.5 dm3. The light source was a 15 W low-pressure mercury lamp. Purification of C02 was performed with an ethanol slush trap (-120 C) by repeating freeze-pump-thaw cycles, and hydrogen and nitrogen gases were deoxygenated by contact with active copper heated to 200 C before introduction into the reaction cell. Analytically pure nickel nitrate and kieselguhr were used in preparation of a 50% Ni0/ksgr catalyst. The crushed catalyst sample (1 g, BET surface area, 85.5 m2 g' i) was placed in the catalyst holder as depicted in Fig. 1. The cell was heated to 300 C in air, and evacuated for 60 min. After the cell was cooled to room temperature, a given pressure of HZ was introduced, and the NiO catalyst was irradiated with the mercury lamp. A given amount of COZ was then admitted to the cell with fresh hydrogen or nitrogen, and the reaction was initiated in the dark. The temperature was controlled by a ribbon heater surrounding the cell. The reaction gas was circulated with a pump at a velocity of 0.25 1 min-1. In the thermal pretreatment, the cell containing NiO catalyst was heated at 300 C in HZ atmosphere (400 torr) with an electric furnace. After the cell attained the desired temperature, COZ was introduced to initiate the reaction. After reaction, the total pressure was restored to 760 torr by admitting Nz. The products were analyzed by means of a JGC-1100 gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector and 5A molecular sieve and activated carbon columns, and a Shimadzu GC-8A gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector and Porapak Q and 5A molecular sieve columns. The low-pressure mercury lamp used in this experiment emitted two main wavelengths of 185 and 245 rum. The output of the lamp was determined by following the rate of photolysis of 1.8 torr of ammonia in 760 torr of helium in the 50 dm' flask. The rate of ammonia loss was measured Fig. 1.

The lamp intensity was estimated to be 2.21 X 10'B quanta s-1, assuming the value of 0.25 as the quantum yield for ammonia photolysis [3]. Results COZ was flowed in the dark onto NiO catalyst which was pretreated in a H2 atmosphere under light irradiation. As shown in Table 1, CH4 is preferentially formed with small amounts of CZHg and C3H8, but CO was not detected. It is seen from this table that the yield of each product is independent of time (in this scale) and temperature, suggesting that this dark reaction is very fast and needs no thermal activation. The effect of the partial pressure of HZ used in the pre-irradiation on the yield of CH4 was studied, and the results are shown in Fig. 2 where, in the dark, COZ was admitted to the cell along with fresh hydrogen or nitrogen gas until the total pressure reached a given value. At lower HZ pressure, the yield of CH4 is proportional to P(HZ)'42, indicating that chemisorbed hydrogen atoms are involved in the reduction of CO2. The behaviour of the yield vs. P(HZ)1~2 plot was not influenced by the kind of gas added in dark, which suggests that the source of hydrogen for the COz reduction is attributed to the HZ used in the pre-irradiation, and not to fresh HZ added in the dark. The effect of the gas pressure in the dark reaction on the product yield was further investigated, and the results obtained agree with those in Fig. 2. In Fig. 3, the partial pressures of COZ and HZ are varied, but the yield of CH4 is independent of the partial pressure of HZ and COZ (P > 2 torr). The yield of CH4 is plotted vs. the pre-irradiation of the NiO catalyst in Fig. 4, where the catalyst was freshly prepared NiO or used NiO for the dark reactions. In both cases, the yields of CH4 are comparable, suggesting that the catalyst used in the dark reaction can be restored to complete TABLE 1 Yields of reaction products obtained in the dark reactions of COZ (100 torr) and NZ (100 torr) mixtures under various conditions' Run Reaction conditions Products (wmol g-') temp. time CH4 C2H6 C3H8 CO ( C) (min) 1 20 5 9.7 0.4 0.2 0 2 20 30 10:1 0.3 0.1 0 3 20 120 9.5 0.4 0.2 0 4 20 210 9.9 0.2 0.3 0 5 80 30 9.7 0.7 0.2 0 6 80 210 9.9 1.3 0.3 0 'NiO was pretreated at P(Hz) 400 torr and 20 C under irradiation of light; irradiation time 120 min. 176 20 - 20 15 O O O-O O O p -~ 041 \"1 a = to - a: r U 10 0 50 tO 150 200 v d j- P(H!)/tar O 20 5 o0 0 o O r to U O 2 3 0 5 10 1 5 P(M=)T /tar\"' P(C02)/torn Fig. 2.

The initial yield of CH4 was proportional to the pretreatment time, with a slope of 8.5 p,mol g-1 h_1. In Fig. 5, the yield of CH4 is shown as a function of the total pressure of the gas used in the catalyst pre-irradiation. The yield decreases slightly with an increase in total pressure, which is ascribed to the coupling of chemisorbed hydrogen atoms and to the unfavorable hydrogenation of C02- The yield of CH4 is shown vs. reaction time in the dark in Fig. 6, where the catalyst was pre-irradiated at 20 C in HZ atmosphere. The results obtained with the NiO catalyst which was pretreated thermally at 300 C in HZ are also illustrated in the same figure. Although the yield of CH4 with the photopretreated catalyst was almost independent of time at 20 and 80 C as described above, no formation of CH4 was observed at 20 C with the thermally pretreated catalyst, and the yield increased slightly with the reaction time at 80 C.

Discussion The methanation of COz has been studied over Ni catalysts prepared by reducing NiO in HZ at high temperature [4, 5]. A mechanism for the thermal hydrogenation of COZ has been proposed, which is basically the same as that for the methanation of CO. This involves (i) dissociative adsorption of H2, (ii) dissociation of COZ to form a carbide, and (iii) hydrogenation of the carbide by adsorbed hydrogen [5, 6]. In step (ii), it is only on sites where C atoms can be bound to several Ni atoms simultaneously that C02 can be dissociated. Hence, the addition of Cu to Ni strongly reduces the rate of methanation [ 6 ]. At room temperature, no reduction of COz to CH4 178 10 -0 photochemica E 3 U o 5 d 1 1 thermal O 1' 60 120 I80 t/min Fig. 6. Time-dependence of the yield of CH9 obtained in the dark catalytic reactions: P(C02)/ P(NZ) -1 /4; total pressure 500 torr; temperature 20 C (A, ), 80 C (0,1). The NiO catalyst was pretreated at P(Hz) 400 torr under the irradiation of light at 20 C (O,A) and thermally at 300 C (1, ). was observed over the thermally pretreated catalyst (Mg. 6), which is attributed to the very slow dissociation of C02 to a carbide. Methanation of C02 over irradiated Ru/RuOx supported Ti02 has been found by Ravindranathan et al. [2], who have proposed a reaction route via carbidic surface carbon formed via bandgap excitation of the 7102 and reduction of C02 to carbon by electrons (conduction band). In the present study, only the NiO catalyst was irradiated in H2, and C02 was then flowed over the catalyst in the dark. These results do not suggest the deposition of a carbide. Adsorption of HZ on an oxide is known to be accompanied by dissociative adsorption onto metal-oxygen pair sites at room temperature [7, 8]. The chemisorption of HZ is heterolytic, involving the formation of metallic hydride and a hydroxyl group. Under the irradiation of light, however, NiO is excited to generate electron-hole pairs, and the oxidation of HZ by a hole and the reduction of H+ by an electron takes place on the catalyst surface. by Ni0 --) Ni0(e-, h''') (1) H2+2h+ --> 2H+ (2) 179 H++e-+S--> H-S (3) where S refers to a surface site. Further reduction of C02 by chemisorption hydrogen can follow a mechanism similar to that proposed for the methanation of CO2 which involves the formation of complexes of a type corresponding to the enol form of formaldehyde [9 J.

The bandgap of NiO is ^- 3.8 eV, according to the optical reflectance spectrum reported by Powell and Spicer [ 10 ]. This value corresponds to 326 nm, and both wavelengths emitted by the low-pressure mercury lamp can excite NiO. The apparent quantum yield for the CH4 formation was estimated to be 0.04 when the NiO catalyst was pre-irradiated at the H2 pressure of 400 torr. The catalyst used in the dark reaction was restored to complete catalytic activity by exposure to the irradiation of light (Fig. 4), and NiO can serve as a catalyst for the CO2 reduction without any decrease in activity. In conclusion, CO2 was selectively reduced to CH4 at room temperature and in the dark over a Ni0/ksgr catalyst pretreated in a H2 atmosphere under the irradiation of light. References 1 P. J.
