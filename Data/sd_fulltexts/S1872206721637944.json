Tel: +86-22-23497716; Tel: +86-22-23497716 High-entropy materials are emerging electrocatalysts by integrating five or more elements into one single crystallographic phase to optimize the electronic structures and geometric environments. Here, a rocksalt-type high-entropy oxide Mg0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2O (HEO) is developed as an electrocatalyst towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The obtained HEO features abundant cation and oxygen vacancies originating from the lattice mismatch of neighboring metal ions, together with enlarged Co/Ni‒O covalency due to the introduction of less electronegative Mg and Zn. As a result, the HEO exhibits superior intrinsic OER activities, delivering a turnover frequency (TOF) 15 and 84 folds that of CoO and NiO at 1.65 V, respectively. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the enhanced OER on HEO and demonstrates the potential of high-entropy strategy in developing efficient oxygen electrocatalysts by elaborately incorporating low-cost elements with lower electronegativity. Graphical Abstract A rocksalt-type high-entropy oxide Mg0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2O featuring enhanced Co/Ni–O covalency and enriched metal and oxygen vacancies was prepared as high-activity and low-cost OER electrocatalyst. Keywords High-entropy material Rocksalt oxide Oxygen evolution reaction Electrocatalyst Defect Metal-oxygen covalency 1 Introduction The sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involving four-electron transfer is a key challenge in electrochemical water splitting and rechargeable metal-air batteries [1–3]. Multifarious electrocatalysts have been developed to surmount the kinetic barrier of OER, among which 3d transition metal oxides (TMOs) are promising candidates to replace the state-of-the-art noble metal-based catalysts [4–8]. Particularly, TMOs with cobalt and nickel active centers have received intensive attention, but their intrinsic activities remain to be further improved [9–12]. In addition, the large-scale application of Co/Ni-based electrocatalysts is plagued by the high price and vulnerable supply, considering the booming demand of Co/Ni in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and other industries [13–15]. As an effective strategy, doping with inexpensive elements could simultaneously minimize the use of expensive metals and regulate the electronic structures between heteroatoms to enhance electrocatalytic activities [16–18]. Unfortunately, tuning the content of doping elements is challenging, as the solubility of heteroatoms in a single phase is often limited to a maximum concentration (e.g., 25 atom%), beyond which the electrocatalysts tend to experience phase separation and performance deterioration [19]. Recently, the emerging high-entropy materials (HEMs) [20,21] are demonstrated to provide a new platform for screening efficient electrocatalysts, as the entropy stabilization effect enables the incorporation of five or more principal metals into a single phase, offering more opportunities to tune the catalytic properties than conventional binary- or ternary-doped materials [22–26]. The site-to-site charge transfer between different metal atoms leads to charge redistribution on the surface, creating more active sites with varied charge densities [27–29]. This scenario may provide a near-continuous distribution of binding energies for intermediates adsorption, which is promising to boost the overall catalytic performance with even a minority of active sites in optimal electronic states [30]. In addition, the lattice distortion arising from the atomic size mismatch between dissimilar metal cations is supposed to facilitate the generation of abundant vacancies [27,31], which not only further rationalizes the electronic structures, but also steers the coordination environments of the active centers, generating more coordination-unsaturated sites for reactant adsorption and activation [32–34]. Given the above merits, several high-entropy electrocatalysts have been proposed for oxygen evolution, including alloys [35–39], spinel oxides [40], layered double hydroxides [41], perovskite fluorides [42], and metal-organic frameworks [43]. However, there is no report on rocksalt-type HEMs for OER, although the Mg-Co-Ni-Cu-Zn-O rocksalt oxide was the first reported five-component high-entropy oxide and has been investigated for LIBs and catalytic CO oxidation [44–46]. Rocksalt oxide has a crystallographic geometry with all cations belonging to one Weckoff site and accommodated in the equivalent octahedral interstices. The metal‒oxygen covalency in octahedral sites was found essential to the OER [47–50], which can be enhanced by shifting more oxygen charge into adjacent cations via partial substitution of neighboring octahedrons with metals of lower electronegativity [51]. Combining the covalency enhancing strategy with high-entropy concept in rocksalt oxide is therefore desirable for accelerating the OER kinetics. Herein, we report the electrospinning assisted synthesis of a high-entropy rocksalt oxide Mg0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2O (denoted as HEO) for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution. With the incorporation of less electronegative Mg (χ = 1.31, electronegativity in Pauling scale) and Zn (χ = 1.65), the Co (χ = 1.88) and Ni (χ = 1.91) cations in the HEO can accept more electrons polarized from neighboring oxygen than in their binary oxides (CoO and NiO). Experimental results reveal that the well-designed composition enables enhanced Co/Ni‒O covalency, and the atomic size mismatch of different metals leads to enriched oxygen and metal vacancies, both of which contribute to notably improved OER performance. As a result, the obtained HEO exhibits a much reduced overpotential of 360 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and remarkably elevated turnover frequency (TOF) at 1.65 V, which is 14 and 83 times higher than that of CoO and NiO, respectively. These results elucidate the mechanism of enhanced electrocatalytic activities of high-entropy metal oxides and shed light on the design of HEMs as efficient oxygen electrocatalysts integrating low-cost and low-electronegativity elements. 2 Experimental 2.1 Chemicals Mg(Ac)2·4H2O (99.98% metals basis), Co(Ac)2·4H2O (99.9%), Ni(Ac)2·4H2O (99.9%), Cu(Ac)2·H2O (99.95%), and dimethyl formamide (DMF, 99.8%) were purchased from Aladdin. Zn(Ac)2 (99.5%) was purchased from 3A Chemicals. Polyacrylonitrile (PAN, M w = 150,000) was supplied by HEOWNS. All the chemicals were used as received without further treatment. 2.2 Synthesis of HEO The Mg0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2O HEO was synthesized via an electrospinning assisted method. Typically, equimolar (2.0 mmol) acetates of the five metals were mixed and dissolved in 6 mL DMF, forming solution A after electromagnetic stirring for 2 h. Meanwhile, 1.5 g PAN was dissolved in 10 mL DMF, forming solution B after electromagnetic stirring for 2 h. Solution A was added into solution B dropwise under stirring. The precursor solution was obtained after stirring for another 10 h. Electrospinning was carried out in a TONG LI TECH Nanofiber Electrospinning Unit, with aluminum foil collector placed 15 cm away from the needle. A high voltage of 18 kV was applied to initiate the electrospinning and the precursor solution was fed at a rate of 0.5 mL h−1. Afterwards, the as-spun fiber membrane was peeled off and subsequently heated in Ar at 250 oC for 1 h and at 700 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. Finally, the product was treated in air at 1000 °C for 2 h. 2.3 Synthesis of Co0.5Ni0.5O The control Co0.5Ni0.5O (denoted as CNO) was prepared through procedures similar to that of HEO, except for that equimolar (typically, 4.0 mmol) acetates of Co and Ni were added into the precursor solution. 2.4 Materials characterizations X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Rigaku Mini Flex 600 X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5406 Å). Raman spectra were recorded using a confocal Raman microscope (DXR, Thermo-Fisher Scientific) with 633 nm excitation from an Ar-ion laser. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained on a JEOL JSM-7500F microscope (acceleration voltage 5 kV) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analyzer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were acquired on a FEI Talos F200X G2 at 200 kV. Elemental analysis was tested by inductively coupled plasma optimal emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, SpectroBlue). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were taken with PHI 5000 VersaProbe. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker A300 EPR spectrometer at 77 K. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) data were collected at the BL14W1 beamline, Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, and processed with the Athena and Artemis programs. 2.5 Electrochemical measurements Electrochemical tests were carried out on a PARSTAT 4000 workstation (AMETEK) at room temperature. A standard three-electrode cell was composed of a counter electrode of graphite rod, a reference electrode of Hg/HgO, and a carbon fiber paper (CFP) supported working electrode. The as-prepared catalyst was mixed with acetylene black in a mass ratio of 3:7, which was ultrasonically treated in a solution of Nafion and isopropanol (5:95) to form homogenous catalytic ink with concentration of 10 mg mL−1. A 100 μL of the prepared ink was drop-cast onto 1×1 cm2 CFP, giving a loading mass of 1 mg cm−2. The OER activities were investigated in 1 M KOH electrolyte saturated with oxygen. All polarization curves were obtained using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 and corrected with 95% iR-compensation [52]. All measured potentials were converted and referred to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out at constant potential of 1.6 V in the frequency range of 100,000–0.1 Hz with a perturbation of 10 mV. The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) was calculated from the C dl according to the Eq. (1): (1) ECSA= C dl/C s where C dl is electrochemical double layer capacitance measured by CV scans in non-Faradaic potential region, and C s is the specific capacitance (0.040 mF cm−2) [53]. The TOF value was calculated from the Eq. (2): (2) TOF= (J × A)/(4 × F × m)) where J is the current density at a given potential (i.e., 1.65 V), A is the geometry area of the electrode, F is the faraday constant (96485 C mol−1), and m is the number of moles of the active metallic sites [52]. All the Ni and/or Co atoms of the catalyst were assumed as active sites. 3 Results and discussion The electrospinning assisted synthesis of HEO is depicted in Fig. 1 . The precursor solution consisting of five metal acetates in equimolar ratio and PAN dissolved in dimethyl formamide is more conducive to the atomic random dispersion of the five dissimilar metal cations, as compared with the reported solid-state blending method [44]. During the electrospinning process, the uniformly distributed metal species were confined in the electrospun PAN nanofibers. The crystalline HEO was obtained after two consecutive thermal treatments of the as-spun nanofibers in Ar and air. As observed from the XRD patterns (Fig. S1), the five peaks attributed to the (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) planes of the HEO concur with that of CoO and NiO, suggesting conversion of metal species into a single-phase rocksalt structure (Fm-3m). The Raman spectra with a broad band at about 530 cm−1 reveal the softening of A1g phonon mode for HEO (Fig. S2), which confirm the cation disordering in the high-entropy oxide [54]. The morphological evolution of the HEO during synthetic process was visualized by SEM images (Fig. S3). After heat treatment in Ar at 700 °C, the homogenously mixed acetates decomposed to form nanoparticles embedded in the nanofibers, which were converted into HEO crystalline grains after annealing in air at 1000 °C. The fiber matrix prevented the grains from unremitting growth or merging under high temperature, leading to smaller particle size than that from conventional solid-state method (Figs. S4 and S5). Besides, the distinctive pyrolysis behaviors of the embedded acetates (expansion outwards) and PAN nanofibers (contraction inwards) during calcination may facilitate the formation of lattice defects as a result of space confined effect [55]. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image (Fig. 2(a) )) displays clear lattice fringes with interplanar distances of 0.24 and 0.21 nm, corresponding to the (111) and (200) planes of the rocksalt HEO, respectively. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 2(b))) suggests the polycrystalline nature of HEO, with discontinuous diffraction rings well indexed to the (200), (311) and (400) planes of cubic rocksalt structure. These results indicate the formation of HEO in single rocksalt phase. The magnified HRTEM image (Fig. 2(c))) evidences the existence of abundant vacancies (yellow ellipses and red ellipse). The defects are supposed to originate from the lattice strain caused by the mismatch of different metal cations [27], as revealed by the difference in the measured interatomic distance between A and B sides (Fig. 2(c)) inset). The enriched vacancies could facilitate the active sites exposure and regulate the electronic structure of the active center, synergistically boosting the OER performance [56]. The EDS elemental mapping of the high-angle annular-dark-field (HAADF) image (Fig. 2(d))) validates the uniform distribution of the five metal elements. According to the EDS (Fig. S6) and ICP-OES (Table S1) results, the five metal elements occur in near-equimolar ratio in the HEO, according with the designed chemical composition. Further insight into the local chemical and structural environment of the metals was gained from synchrotron-based XAS analysis. As seen from the k 3-weighted extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra (Fig. S7), the oscillation of Co, Ni, Cu and Zn K-edge of HEO coincides with each other and are similar to that of CoO and NiO, indicating the uniform random dispersion and similar local environment of each metal within a single cation sublattice [44]. Fig. 3(a)) and 3(b) present the Co K-edge and Ni K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra, respectively. The Co K-edge profile for HEO resembles that for CoO, again confirming similar electronic structure and coordination environment of Co in both samples. Nonetheless, the magnified absorption edge (Fig. 3(a)) inset) reveals slightly negative shift from CoO to HEO, implying an average valence state lower than Co(II) in HEO. Analogously, the Ni K-edge XANES spectra disclose the reduced Ni valence in HEO as compared to NiO. The lower oxidation states of Co and Ni in HEO corroborate the facilitated partial electron polarization from oxygen towards adjacent Co and Ni, as a result of the introduction of less electronegative Mg and Zn. The results agree well with the reduced Barder charge on Co and Ni in HEO than in CoO and NiO (Fig. S8) [57] and suggest an enhanced covalency of Co/Ni–O bond [51]. Fourier transforms (FT) of k 3-weighted Co K-edge EXAFS spectra are displayed in Fig. 3(c)), in which the two peaks located at around 1.65 and 2.58 Å correspond to the first Co–O shell and Co–M (M = Mg, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) shell, respectively. Likewise, the FT-EXAFS spectra of Ni K-edge (Fig. 3(d))) exhibit two peaks at about 1.65 and 2.58 Å assigned to the first shell of Ni–O and Ni–M path, respectively. Strikingly, the lengths of Co/Ni–O paths in HEO are slightly shorter than that in CoO and NiO (insets in Fig. 3(c)), (d)), which again verifies the higher degree of covalent character of Co/Ni–O bond in HEO. In addition, the amplitude of the Ni–O shell in R space for HEO is obviously lower than that for NiO, as a proof of the existence of oxygen vacancies. Despite the higher amplitude of Co–O shell than CoO, the fitted coordination number (N) of Co–O in HEO (4.4) is smaller than that in CoO (4.7) (Table S2), further revealing enriched oxygen vacancies. Aside from oxygen deficiencies, metal defects are also evidenced by the clearly reduced intensity of the Co/Ni–M shells for HEO (Figs. 3(c)) and (d)) and the fitted coordination number of Co–M that decreases from 11.7 (CoO) to 9.6 (HEO) and Ni–M that decreases from 11.2 (NiO) to 9.9 (HEO) (Tables S2 and S3). The results agree with the observation of abundant vacancies in TEM imaging. The character of the neighboring atoms around the metal center is further analyzed by wavelet transform (WT) of EXAFS oscillations, which provides high resolution in both R and k spaces [58,59]. Besides the dependence on path length R, the position of WT intensity maxima in k space is quite sensitive to atomic number Z [60]. As shown in the WT contour plots of Co and Ni spectra based on Morlet wavelets (Figs. 3(e)) and (f)), two features located near 4.0 and 6.6 Å−1 could be resolved for all samples as the first M–O and M–M shell, respectively. Apparently, the maximum associated with the Co−M scattering path for HEO locates at larger k position than that for CoO, implying the existence of metal atoms with larger atomic number (Z) (e.g., Ni, Cu, Zn) than Co in the Co−M shell of HEO [61]. For Ni K-edge spectra, however, the WT maximum assigned to the Ni−M shell shows negligible position shift in k space from NiO to HEO, which could be attributed to the equimolar neighboring atoms with both lower (e.g., Mg and Co) and higher (e.g., Cu and Zn) Z than Ni. The WT-EXAFS analysis interprets the random distribution of different metal atoms in the Co/Ni–M coordination shells of the prepared HEO. XPS was conducted to further identify the surface composition and oxidation information. As shown in Fig. S9, all the metal elements (Mg, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) can be recognized in the full spectrum. The Mg 2p spectral peak at ~49.1 eV, the Cu 2p 3/2 peak at ~933.8 eV with shake-up peaks, and the energy difference of 23.1 eV between Zn 2p 1/2 and Zn 2p 3/2 splitting concur with that of their divalent oxides [62,63], suggesting the oxidation state of +2 of the metal (Mg, Cu, Zn) cations in HEO (Fig. S10). In the high-resolution Co 2p spectra (Fig. 4(a) )), at least four characteristic peaks are observed: the two main peaks located at ~780.5 and ~796.8 eV are attributed to Co 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2, respectively, and are accompanied by two satellites. The Co 2p profile could be deconvoluted into two pairs of sub-peaks characteristic of Co2+ and Co3+ component [64]. The Co3+ species may originate from the inevitable surface oxidation [65]. As indicated by the peak areas, the HEO shows lower Co3+/Co2+ ratio compared to the binary counterpart CoO. Analogously, the fine-scan Ni 2p spectra can be fitted with six peaks, including two pairs of spin-orbit doublets ascribed to Ni2+ and Ni3+ and two shakeup satellites (Fig. 4(b))) [66]. Compared with that of NiO, the Ni 2p 1/2 and 2p 3/2 peaks corresponding to Ni3+ of HEO account for a smaller proportion in the peak area. These results imply the lower surface Co/Ni valence state, which is consistent with the XANES analysis and is another proof of enhanced Co/Ni–O covalency in HEO. The O 1s spectra for all samples showcase two characteristic peaks centered at around 529.5 and 531.2 eV, respectively (Fig. 4(c))), which are ascribed to the lattice oxygen and inherent oxygen defects in the oxide [65,67]. Impressively, the HEO possesses an evidently higher fraction of defective oxygen component than NiO or CoO, which is further verified by EPR test (Fig. 4(d))). Since the EPR response at g value of 2.003 mainly stems from the unpaired electrons of oxygen vacancies [68], the increased signal intensity provides an evidence for the presence of higher-ratio oxygen defects in the HEO. By virtue of the enhanced Co/Ni–O covalency and enriched metal and oxygen vacancies, the HEO was expected to deliver high activity towards water oxidation. As indicated by the LSV curves obtained in O2-saturated 1 M KOH (Fig. 5(a) )), the HEO exhibits higher OER activities in comparison with its binary oxide (MO, M = Mg, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) counterparts. The HEO requires a much lower overpotential of 360 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 than CoO and NiO, while MgO, CuO and ZnO show negligible OER activity within the potential range, implying the active centers being Co and Ni species in HEO. The ternary oxide CNO consisting of equimolar Co and Ni constituent was also synthesized by the electrospinning assisted strategy (Figs. S11 and S12). Surprisingly, no evident improvement was observed on CNO as compared to NiO, suggesting that the enhanced performance of HEO is mainly attributed to the strengthened Co/Ni–O covalency and increased surface defects, instead of the synergy between Co and Ni sites. The corresponding Tafel slope of HEO (61.4 mV dec−1) is smaller than those of CoO, NiO and CNO (Fig. 5(b))), indicative of facilitated reaction kinetics of HEO. The EIS results are shown with Nyquist plots acquired at 1.6 V (Figs. 5(c)) and S13), with a semicircle in the high-frequency domain representing the electron transfer process. Evidently, the HEO exhibits the lowest charge transfer resistance (R ct) of 19 Ω among the series of catalysts, suggesting favored interfacial charge transport between the active sites on HEO and intermediates. The OER performance of the HEO is comparable to most of high-entropy electrocatalysts reported recently (Table S4) [35–43]. To further evaluate the intrinsic activity, the TOF was assessed with all the Co and Ni cations deemed as active sites. As demonstrated in Fig. 5(d)), the TOF of HEO after 1.55 V far exceeds those of other samples, considering the much lower Co/Ni content in HEO. Furthermore, the measured ECSA is comparable for each sample (Figs. S14 and S15). The HEO manifests dramatically elevated intrinsic activity relative to CoO, NiO, and CNO, as revealed by the multi-angle comparisons in TOF, mass activities and specific activities at 1.65 V (Fig. 5(e))). For example, the TOF of HEO is 0.023 s−1, 15 and 84 folds that of CoO and NiO, respectively. Given the much lower Co and Ni content, the superior activity of HEO can be attributed to the enlarged Co/Ni–O covalency as well as the enriched metal and oxygen vacancies generated by the atomic mismatch of different metal species in the high-entropy oxide. The duration ability of the HEO was examined by chronopotentiometry test at 10 mA cm− 2. The HEO electrode exhibited excellent stability for more than 25 h with minor deterioration (Fig. 5(f))). Structural and compositional stability of HEO after long-term test was also confirmed by the essentially maintained XRD pattern, SEM morphology and elemental ratio/distribution (Figs. S16–S18). In-situ Raman analysis was further conducted to monitor the surface evolution of HEO under electrochemical condition. As displayed in Fig. S19, there is no evident shift or intensity decay for the characteristic band centered at ~530 nm− 1 when the potential was increased from open circuit potential (OCP) to 1.85 V, indicating little structural variation of the HEO. 4 Conclusions In summary, we report the electrospinning synthesis of high-entropy Mg0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2O rocksalt oxide and its electrocatalytic application for oxygen evolution. The HEO exhibits much improved OER performances compared to the binary CoO and NiO, with a lower overpotential of 360 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a higher TOF of 0.023 s−1 at 1.65 V. The superior intrinsic activities can be ascribed to the regulated electronic and geometric structures of the HEO. Firstly, the incorporation of Mg and Zn with lower electronegativity (relative to Co and Ni) into the single rocksalt phase can shift more oxygen charge towards adjacent Co/Ni and strengthen the Co/Ni-O covalence. Secondly, the lattice distortion stemming from the atomic size mismatch of randomly occupied distinct metal cations leads to enriched metal and oxygen vacancies, which favor exposure of unsaturated active sites for reactant adsorption and electron transfer. This work would deepen the mechanistic understanding of the boosted OER on multinary oxides, and foster the development of efficient electrocatalysts economizing on the use of expensive metals by feat of high-entropy strategies.

        "dc:description": "High-entropy materials are emerging electrocatalysts by integrating five or more elements into one single crystallographic phase to optimize the electronic structures and geometric environments. Here, a rocksalt-type high-entropy oxide Mg0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2O (HEO) is developed as an electrocatalyst towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The obtained HEO features abundant cation and oxygen vacancies originating from the lattice mismatch of neighboring metal ions, together with enlarged Co/Ni‒O covalency due to the introduction of less electronegative Mg and Zn. As a result, the HEO exhibits superior intrinsic OER activities, delivering a turnover frequency (TOF) 15 and 84 folds that of CoO and NiO at 1.65 V, respectively. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the enhanced OER on HEO and demonstrates the potential of high-entropy strategy in developing efficient oxygen electrocatalysts by elaborately incorporating low-cost elements with lower electronegativity.",
