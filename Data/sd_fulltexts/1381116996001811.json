The SEC analysis of pumice is based on benzene and a set of 13 polystyrenes (700 < uma _< 1,500,000) as standard probes. A modelistic approach which can detect fractal properties of the materials is presented. SEC confirmed the main physical characteristics of pumice, determined by other techniques, and, in addition, showed that a bidistribution of pore size and fractal properties are present in pumice. Since SEC is performed in liquid phase, it could become an interesting tool for the characterization of the catalytic materials employed in liquid phase reactions.

Introduction The pumice of Lipari was recently reproposed as support for metal catalysts [1] on the basis of interesting results obtained with metal/pumice catalysts in the selective hydrogenation of dienes [2,3] and alkynes [4-6]. The chemical composition of pumice is close to that of natural zeolites, but opposite to zeolites, pumice is amorphous. Recently, the structure of pumice was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and 27Amagic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (2TAI MAS Corresponding author.

PH S1381-1169(96)00181-1 NMR) [7] and wide angle neutron scattering (WANS) [8]. Pumice grains < 45 Am have a low surface area [ 1 ] (< 5 m2 g-1) and a relatively high `apparent' density [9] (2.35 g cm-3). Gas adsorption methods (BET-surface area and BJH method) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analyses [1] indicate that pumice is a non-porous material with smooth surface, whereas SANS and WANS analyses [8] suggest that pumice presents a large number of pores with dimensions that are mainly ranging between 30 and 500 The presence of Na+ and K+ in the framework of pumice seems to be relevant in promoting some unusual properties in metal/pumice catalysts. Thus, Pd/pumice showed good activity in the hydrogenation of 414 D. Duca, G. Deganello /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 112 (1996) 413-421 highly unsaturated hydrocarbons [2-6] up to large metal dispersions whereas Pd supported on more traditional oxides (silica and alumina) showed a drastic decrease in activity at metal dispersions higher than 20% [10,11]. Interestingly, a shift of Pd 3d binding energies towards negative values was determined in Pd/pumice catalysts [12,13] suggesting a transfer of electronic density on the supported metal. Recently these shifts in addition to the Auger energy shifts were employed to estimate the electron density on the Pd particles of the Pd/pumice catalysts and a nice correlation was found [ 14] between electron density on the pumice-supported Pd particles and catalytic activity. Moreover, for the first time, in the case of pumice supported Pd catalysts, stacking-faults [15-17] were detected. At present we do not know whether stacking-faults features are related to the peculiar influence of the support or to the method of preparation of the catalysts. In the present study we present deeper insights on the morphological properties of pumice by SEC [ 18,19], and we hope to show the potentiality of this technique in the analysis of materials of interest in catalysis. 2. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) The use of a chromatographic method for the determination of morphological data of porous solids, already considered since 1960, was developed by Halz and Martin [20] in 1970. Since the theoretical basis of the technique and the different approaches to the interpretation of experimental data are well documented in literature [19,21-23], here we remind only some necessary concepts. 2.1. General aspects The determination of porosity by SEC requires high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipment. The solvents used (i.e., the mobile phase in chromatography), usually have a polarity ranging between that of water and that of tetrahydrophuran (THF). The sample of the material is packed with dry or slurry methods in the stainless steel tubes used in HPLC. The porous structure of the sample sieves the standard probe molecules solubilized in the mobile phase. No interactions are assumed to take place between the solutes and the material [ 18] and the retention time of the different molecules is therefore related to their rates of migration through the pores of the material. Although there are some disagreements about the mechanism of separation [24], its correlation on the specific distribution of molecule solutes between mobile and stationary phase is widely accepted. The sizes of the probe molecules and the sizes of the pores are responsible for the above distribution. Therefore, the smallest probe (e.g. benzene) pass through the largest number of pores [ 18], while molecules of larger size pass through a smaller portion of the above pores. The retention time is greater [18] for smaller molecules and therefore, the elution of the probe molecules [24] starts with the largest ones. Since SEC analysis is based on the interaction between liquid and solid phases, it is likely that SEC can be preferred to other techniques in the study of catalytic materials employed in liquid phase reaction. Besides benzene, the usual standard probes in the analysis of rigid materials are styrene polymers of different molecular weight [20]. These polymers are considered as non-deformable spherical particles. An approximate empirical relation between the molecular weight (MW) of these probe molecules and their effective `hard sphere' diameters (cp) (i.e., the apparent diameter of the probe molecule in the solvent) was proposed [25]. Thus, for the generic i-th probe molecule: 91 ' a(MW) ai . Although the values of a and a, the empirical parameters, are reported by different authors [20,25,26], it is preferable to determine them by D. Duca, G. Deganello/Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 112 (1996) 413-421 standardizing the own system [25] using materials of known morphology. Eq. (1) is fundamental in SEC analysis together with the formal definition of the elution volume Vei [25] for the generic i-th probe molecule: Vei=V +K;V,, (2) where Vj represents the interparticle volume, Vir the intraparticle volume and Ki the exclusion coefficient [25] (0 < Kl < 1) of the i-th molecule. Ki gives the fraction of the intraparticle volume explored by the probe molecule. The elution volume for a generic molecule i, having an effective diameter cpj, is a cumulative volume determined by the pores of the sample with an accessible diameter [27] larger or equal to cpl. Therefore, Eq. (2) is suitable only if the size of the largest probe molecules inhibits its exploration of the intraparticle volume, but it allows the exploration of the interparticle volume; in other words, the exclusion coefficient is 0 for the largest probe. 2.2. Modelistic approach Although a neutron diffraction study could not detect volume fractality for pumice, the existence of fractal characteristics in this material was not ruled out [8]. To verify this possibility a modelistic approach [18,28], amenable to detect, if present, fractal characteristics [29,30] of the materials was employed in this SEC study of pumice. In place of the availability coefficient [ 18] usually employed in fractal modeling, we used the exclusion coefficient [25] which is related by a constant to the first one. The relation between the exclusion coefficient K; and the molecular weights (MW )i of the probes is: Ki = h,(MW)b It is important to underline that Ki is also the pore-volume [9], cumulative volume per gram of the material, detected by molecules with (3) 415 molecular weight ( MW )i normalized to the total pore-volume of the porous solid. /-t is a shape factor related to the morphological characteristics of the material and b is a parameter related to the fractal dimension [29,30] characterizing self-similar systems. If MW is a non-discrete continuous variable, from Eq. (3) one can obtain: dK/d(MW) = bK/(MW). (4) In real systems the value determined by different probes and connected to a measurement of a morphological property of a material has a lower ( L) and an upper ( U ) limit. Therefore, for non-ideal systems [18,28]: Kim (dK/d(MW)) -> 0 K-L ~m (d K/d( MW )) - 0. (Sa) (Sb) In the present case, these limits are determined by probes that cannot detect the studied property above a limit value of MW , and probes that detect it in all the details below another and opposite limit value of MW. Therefore, according to Sernetz et al. [18,28] we used: dK/d(MW) _ [b(U-K)(x-L)] in place of Eq. (4), since it asymptotically tends to 0 when K - U or K - L and, therefore, it is more appropriate in representing a real situation. Integration of Eq. (6) gives the analytical expression of the exclusion coefficient employed in our modelistic approach: K=U~1-[1-L/U] /[1+exp[b(ln(MW)-Q)]]} (7) where K[ln( MW )] is a sigmoid function with a slope determined by b and with the inflection point at ln( MW ) = Q. The volume fractal properties of a material using SEC technique can be determined by the analysis of the physical properties related to the solid-liquid interface of the material [ 18]. The 416 D. Duca, G. Deganello/Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 112 (1996) 413-421 function K[ln(Mw)] which does not contain any information on the solid-liquid interface of the material [18], is not useful to this purpose. However, by scaling the cumulative non-available pore-volume: (U-K)/(U-L) = 1/[1 + exp[(3 - D)(1n(Mw) - Q)]] (8a) obtained from Eq. (7) and including the solidliquid interface [ 18], it is possible to determine D (the fractal dimension of the material). If, however, as in the case of pumice (see below), different pore-volume distributions overlap into the material, in order to avoid any influence of the overlapping, the fractal dimensions are determined [18] by scaling the following equation: (U-K)/(K-L) - f [(Mw) - (Mw).] lL(Mw)M (Mw)]]3 D (8b) where ( Mw ) and ( Mw )M are the lower and the upper cut-off inside limits of the considered fractality range, respectively. The validity of Eq. (8b), employed in this work is supported by experimental studies and by computer simulations [ 18]. For the sake of simplicity, from now on Eq. (8b) will be represented as T= - 3-D. Since for generic materials the surface detected by the probe molecule with effective `hard sphere' diameter cp is S( cp) _ JV,(d K/d cp)j, the total surface of the material in our study was obtained by considering the S( cp) value originated by the smallest probe molecule (i.e., the molecule which detects all the total pore-volume present in the material). Furthermore, JdV j _ JV,~d K(cp)j is the differential cumulative volume, that is, the difference between the volume detected by a probe with a diameter cp and that detected by a probe with a diameter 50 + d cp. Then, setting d cp at a value sufficiently small, the pore size distribution [9] related to the total amount of the material can be graphically represented by JdV j/d cp versus cp + d cp/2. In conclusion, in this work, the theoretical trend of K and the related parameters were determined by a fit of a mathematical model to the experimental K versus ln( Mw), and, the fractal properties as well as the specific surface area and the pore size distribution of the material were determined using the above reported equations of S( cp) and JdV j/d cp. 3. Experimental The HPLC apparatus (GILSON) was equipped with a Piston pump type 302, a HM Holochrome UV/Vis detector, set on 254 gm, a Manometric module type 802, and an Automatic Sampler type 232-401. The elution time of each standard probe was measured at the maximum of the peak and the elution volume was obtained by multiplying time per elution flow. The reagents used have HPLC purity grade. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Koch Light) was used as eluent phase. 0.2% solutions in THF of benzene (Ph) (Aldrich) and a set of thirteen polystyrene standards (Aldrich) with molecular weight within a range of 700 and 1,500,000 uma, were used as probes. The pumice (grain dimension < 45 gm) was purified before analysis according to a published procedure [17]. After this treatment, the pumice (3.8964 g) was packed in a HPLC stainless steel tube (250 mm X 4.6 mm, effective column volume 4.2415 ml) by a slurry method [31]. The column was thermostated at 298 K. Pumice was washed with THF until a stable pressure was reached ( - 6 h) in the column (15 1 bar) and the flow of the eluent phase during the experiments was set at a very low value (0.25 cm 3 min-'). In order to have sound statistics, at least 10 analyses were performed for every i-th probe molecule. Moreover, every analysis was composed of three different D. Duca, G.

The first injection was always that of the largest probe that evaluated V , the last always that of the smallest one (Ph), that, in first approximation, evaluated V + V, and the middle the one of the considered probe, that evaluated Vi. This procedure allowed to have for every analysis a self-determined value of K (see Eq. (1)). The averaged standard deviation on the experimental values of K was 0.008. The values of a = 0.0412 and a = 0.588 em ployed in Eq. (1) in order to have the hard sphere diameters of the molecules were those suggested by Nikolov [25]. In fact, the SEC analysis performed on two standard products (silica-gel Davisil standard grade (Aldrich), grain dimension < 20 ,m, surface area 480 m2 g - t, pore-volume 0.75 cm 3 g- -')) and (alumina standard grade (Aldrich), grain dimension < 130 .cm, surface area 150 m2 g-' ), using the above Nikolov parameters and the reported ex perimental conditions gave results with less than 5% deviation from those reported in literature. The symbols of the probe molecules employed in this work, their molecular weights MW and the corresponding hard sphere diameters cpN; are reported in Table 1. All the computing procedures of this work 417 were performed using FORTRAN programs in house developed. 4. Results and discussion Usually the smallest probe used in the morphological characterization by SEC is benzene. Therefore, if V, (the intraparticle volume) is determined by the elution volume of benzene, pores with a diameter smaller than 0.5 nm (see Table 1) are arbitrarily excluded. To avoid this, an extrapolation, using POLINT on four points [32], of the elution volume value of a hypothetical probe having a hard sphere diameter tending to zero was performed. The total pumice porevolume (total volume of the pores in the pumice) obtained is about 5% larger than that obtained using benzene as the smallest probe. The above procedure was applied also to hypothetical probe molecules with hard sphere diameters smaller than 0.3 nm. Since, however, the value of the total pumice pore-volume did not increase further, pore diameters smaller than 0.3 nm were ruled out in pumice.

Deganello /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 112 (1996) 413-421 with the fitting curves (see below). The value of V,, is obtained by the above mentioned extrapolation, while VI is determined by the elution volume of probe molecule S 13. The points of Fig. 1 fit on a curve resulting by a combination of two sigmoids; in SEC analysis, two different distributions of pore-volume [18,33] are assumed when the above conditions occurs. These distributions can be related to inter- and intraparticle [ 18] pore-volume or to a bidistribution of intra-particle [33] pore-volumes. Since the sizes of the pumice grains are about two order of magnitude greater than the sizes of the largest pores detected, and the inter-particle pores are like to have sizes comparable to those of the grains, inter-particle pore-volume can be excluded. In order to study this intra-particle bidistribution of pore-volumes, Eq. (7) is modified as follows: K=flKl +f2K2 (9) where KI and K2 are both equal to K of Eq. (7), although working in two different ranges of pore-volume. Their upper and lower limits are different as well as their fractal dimensions and inflection points. Moreover, 0 <_ fl < 1 and f2 = 1 - fl are Fermi functions driving the transition from one to the other range of pore-volume and: fl=1/{1+expP[ln(MW)-Col]} (10) where cpl is the intermediate value in the range of transition between the two pore-volume distributions and /3 is a parameter that determines the rapidity of the above transition. In a first attempt, 6 parameters were employed to fit Eq. (9) to the experimental K versus ln(MW ). Then, besides (3 and cpl of the Fermi functions, the upper U and lower L limits in the two porevolume ranges were considered. However, the upper UI limit of the first pore-volume range had a value closely to 1 while the value of the lower L2 limit of the second pore-volume range is practically 0. Moreover, both, the lower LI and upper U2 limits, had values closely to K(cpl). Assuming UI = 1, L2 = 0 and LI = U2 = K(cpl), the model fitted the experimental data only with the two parameters of the Fermi functions. The calculation of the various parameters was performed according to the following procedure: (a) Application of a SIMPLEX procedure [32], in order to select the two fitting parameters and cp I . (b) Employing the experimental values of K and the interpolated value of K(cpl), POLINT procedure [32], use of the logit transformation [34] of Eq. (7): In[(K-L)/(U-K)] =b[(ln(MW)-Q)] in the two range of pore-volume distribution in order to determine the parameters bl, b2, QI and Q2. (c) Use of Eq. (9) in order to calculate K( MW ), the goodness of fitting was given by comparison of the experimental and calculated K values through a X 2 function. (d) Use of the SIMPLEX [32] in order to test if the imposed limits of convergence in the fitting are achieved or not and then if the fitting procedure (point a) was to be continued or not. The parameters obtained by the above operations are reported in Table 2, and the fitting curve in Fig. 1. Curves A and B represent the contribution of KI and K2, respectively, to the sitting curve. Since the value of parameter is great, the transition between the two range of pore-volume is fast, supporting the LI = U2 = K(cpl) imposition. b parameter gives the dispersion of the K Table 2 Calculated parameters a xz w, L, = Uz b, Qi bz Qz 1.45940(8)X 10-4 5.184(9) 1.0647(6)x 101 5.036(2) X 10- 1 -8.038(1>x 10- 8.1949(8) - 1.5370(8) 1.21299(8)X 101 a For the meaning of the symbols see text.

The interparticle volume, V j, of our system resulted 2.62 cm3 while the intraparticle vol ume, V, resulted 0.24 cm3. Employing the equation S( cp) _ IV,,(dK/dcp)l, the surface of pumice in the column was determined considering an hypothetical probe with a hard sphere diameter cp = 0.3 nm. This cumulative surface 7.6 m2 normalized to the amount of pumice in the column gives 1.95 m2 g-t as specific surface area. The `apparent' density d of pumice, known the volume of the column Vc and the weight of the material W, was obtained by d = Wm/(Vc - V.) as 2.40 g cm-', while the total porosity, s [9], obtained by s = V,,/(V, - V) resulted 0.15. Besides the pore size distribution, the low value of total porosity and the specific surface area as well as the value of density of pumice are in accord with our previous results obtained 420 D. Duca, G. Deganello/Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 112 (1996) 413-421 by other techniques [7,8]. The low total porosity of pumice determined in this study suggests that porous are mainly on the surface of the support. This hypothesis is well in agreement with the values of the fractal dimension found and, therefore, it is easy to speculate that the surface roughness could condition the growing on pumice of the first layers of metal crystallites thus originating the stacking-faults formed in pumice-supported Pd and Pt catalysts [15-17]. In addition kinetic studies on three phase (gasliquid-solid) reactor systems employing pumice-supported metal catalysts [2-6] do not suffer dramatically by mass transfer limitation, probably owing to the absence of intraparticle diffusion phenomena. 5. Conclusions Although the low surface area and the presence of pores in the pumice were already established [8], this study shows for the first time the surface bimodal distribution of these pores and the fractal properties of pumice. The high number of surface micropores on pumice can explain the presence of stacking-faults found by X-ray diffraction techniques [17-19] in pumice supported Pd and/or Pt catalysts. The low pore-volume of pumice, being localized on the surface does not cause dramatic mass transferring problems in catalytic reactions with metal/pumice catalysts; the surface porevolume of pumice, however, can influence the modality of growing of the metal crystallites on the support. The SEC technique is, therefore, a useful tool for the characterization of supports and could be an interesting alternative or at least an additional technique for studies of porous materials used in catalysis.

Fax: +39-91-6166281 Size exclusion chromatography (SEC), a technique usually employed as preparative and/or analytical tool, gives more insights on the morphology of pumice, a natural amorphous alumino-silicate recently reproposed as support for metal catalysts. The SEC analysis of pumice is based on benzene and a set of 13 polystyrenes (700 ≤ uma ≤ 1,500,000) as standard probes. A modelistic approach which can detect fractal properties of the materials is presented. SEC confirmed the main physical characteristics of pumice, determined by other techniques, and, in addition, showed that a bidistribution of pore size and fractal properties are present in pumice. Since SEC is performed in liquid phase, it could become an interesting tool for the characterization of the catalytic materials employed in liquid phase reactions.
