Box 101251, D-8580 Bayreuth (F.R.G.) and A. Baiker Department of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, ETH Zentrum, CH-8092 Zurich (Switzerland) (Received April 10, 1990; revised June 11, 1990) Abstract Hydrogenation reactions over zirconia-supported palladium catalysts have been investigated by diffuse reflectance FTIR spectroscopy. Catalysts obtained by activation of an amorphous Pdz5Zr75 precursor, as well as catalysts prepared by wet impregnation of zirconia, were characterized in flowing CO/Hg or COz/Hg reactant gases, respectively, in the temperature range 298 473 K. In addition, species present on the catalyst surface under equilibrated conditions were studied in the static system, after the gas flow was terminated. Sup- plementary information was obtained by studying the surface reactions occurring when the catalyst was first exposed to reaction conditions, and subsequently to a stream of pure hydrogen. Surface species were identified by comparison with adsorption studies in which the catalysts were loaded with reference compounds (C02, formaldehyde, methanol and methanol^), and the surface spectrum recorded as a function of temperature. Upon exposure to COa/Hg, rapid formation of surface formate was observed. Similarly, CO was rapidly transformed to formate upon initial adsorption onto the surface of the activated catalysts. The disappearance of formate, as observed in the FTIR spectrum, could be correlated with the appearance of gas phase methane. A second major route of surface reactions, which proceeds from CO/Ha mixtures, involves adsorbed CO, TT- bonded formaldehyde, surface-bound methylate, and gas phase methanol as the product. Interestingly, there was no observable correlation between adsorbed formaldehyde or methylate on the one hand, and gas phase methane on the other hand. The steps involved in the surface reactions on zirconia and palladium/zirconia are discussed in detail, by comparison with the reactions observed when the catalysts were exposed to reference compounds relevant to the reaction mechanism. Introduction During the last two decades, extensive work has been carried out in examining the mechanism of catalytic hydrogenation reactions of CO and COg which produce methanol and methane. Many investigations were devoted Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/90/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 224 to the question which of the two reactants, carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide, is the most effective starting material for the production of methanol. Another issue that has been intensively discussed is whether the reactions proceed via surface formate or via other intermediates [1, 2]. In Klier's review [ 1 ] three basic mechanisms of adsorbed CO hydrogenation are discussed: carbon-down, oxygen-down and side-on hydrogenation. The latter pathway to methanol is not impeded by large thermodynamic barriers and therefore feasible, but adsorbed formaldehyde as an intermediate in that path has never been observed. However, it was shown that for at least one catalyst, Rh/TiOg, a second C 0 bond was not formed during CO hydro- genation, which indicates that methanol synthesis does not require formate as an intermediate [3]. Klier [1] concludes that palladium, platinum, iridium and copper will behave similarly to the Rh/TiOg catalyst, and will not favour the formate route to methanol. The alternative oxygen-down hydrogenation involves formate as a precursor of methoxide and methanol, and has been discussed for ZnO catalysts [2]. Klier's conclusion is confirmed by Hicks and Bell [5], who find that the presence of formates on supported palladium catalysts is not correlated with the kinetics of methanol synthesis. The reaction to methanol is therefore suggested to proceed via a hydroxymethylene [Me CH(OH) Me] rather than a formate intermediate. In contrast, Kikuzono et al. [4] propose a mechanism in which formate is hydrogenated to methanol on Pd/SiOg catalysts. In Part I of their methanol synthesis review, Chinchen et al. [6] point out that carbon dioxide may also be hydrogenated to methanol on supported palladium, with the formation of surface formate as the first step. From the fact that formates have been observed on palladium-based methanol synthesis catalysts, Chinchen et al. [6] conclude, in direct contradiction to Klier [I], that formate may also be a common intermediate in the rhodium-based methanation and methanol synthesis catalysts. In an investigation of COg hydrogenation, Ramaroson et al. [7] de- monstrate a support dependence of the selectivity to either methanol (Pd/ Laa03) or methane (Pd/SiOg). Investigations by Erdohelyi et al. [8] with palladium on various supports suggest that formate, as an intermediate in COg hydrogenation, can be hydrogenated to methane to a great extent, but not to methanol. Diagne et al. [9] have studied CO hydrogenation over Pd/ CeOg and CeOa catalysts. They conclude that fonnyl species are involved in methanol synthesis on Pd/CeOa surfaces, whereas on CeOg formate species were detected as intermediates [9]. In this study we shall address the following questions: (a) Which intermediates can be observed on the surface of our zirconia- supported metal catalysts during the hydrogenation of COa and CO? (b) Is it possible to correlate the occurrence of certain intermediates with the predominance of either hydrogenation product, methanol or methane? (c) Can it be distinguished whether methanol formation proceeds from COg or CO as the immediate precursor? Under the reaction conditions used, C02 and CO can potentially be interconverted by the water-gas shift reaction. 225 (d) Are there indications of the origin of the different product selectivity patterns that have been observed for the various catalysts? During hydro- genation of COg over copper/zirconia catalysts, methanol is produced as the main product, with selectivities depending on reaction conditions [10]. Palladium/zirconia catalysts prepared by wet impregnation predominantly produce methane under the same conditions [11]. Only recently it has been observed that for palladium/ZrCXr catalysts prepared by activation of amorphous PdiZrg alloys, methanol is obtained with selectivities up to \"45% [11]. The first three questions will be addressed in Part I, in which results for palladium/zirconia catalyst systems are presented. The factors that de- termine the selectivity to methanol (question d)) will be discussed in Part II, by comparing the spectroscopic evidence obtained on Cu/ZrOg and Pd/ ZrOg catalysts. Experimental Spectra were recorded on an FTIR spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer, model 1710) using a diffuse reflectance unit equipped with a controlled environmental chamber (Spectra Tech). The temperature in the chamber could be controlled within 2 K. The spectrometer and temperature controller were connected to a personal computer (Nixdorf, AT 386) for data handling and processing. The gas dosing system was designed to introduce up to three gases independently into the reaction chamber. The gas flows were adjusted to the desired values using volume flow controllers (Rota). Liquid reagents were introduced by bubbling nitrogen through a sealed flask containing the liquid. Nitrogen (Linde, 99.999%) as the carrier gas, as well as carbon dioxide (Linde, 99.9993%), carbon monoxide (Linde, 99.997%) and hydrogen (Linde, 99.999%) as reactants were used without further purification. High purity methanol and methanol-d4 served as reference compounds in the adsorption experiments. Formaldehyde was adsorbed from a 37% aqueous solution containing 10% methanol for stabilization. The catalyst samples under in- vestigation were prepared from an amorphous precursor (Pda5Zr75), and by wet impregnation of a precipitated zirconia support (Pd/ZrOg, 5 wt.% pal- ladium), according to the procedure reported in an earlier investigation [11]. Before the FTIR measurements, the catalysts are reactivated in hydrogen flow at elevated temperatures (450 500 K) for several hours. During this procedure care must be taken to choose a low heating rate (<5 K min~1): the samples derived from the amorphous precursor, in particular, have a surface structure which is sensitive and unstable with respect to rapid heating. After reactivation, the background spectrum is collected at the temperature to be maintained during the following catalytic reaction (453 473 K). A defined flow of the gaseous reactants, with the desired pre-adjusted compo- sition, is passed over the sample at a total pressure of about 3X105 Pa. Subsequently the surface reaction is studied by recording time-resolved FTIR 226 spectra at a resolution of 4 or 8 cm\"1, respectively. From 20 to 500 scans were accumulated, depending upon the system and the time scale on which time-dependent changes had to be resolved. Gaseous reaction products are easily detected by closing the in- and outlet valves of the reaction chamber; this situation will be referred to as a 'static system'. In the 'dynamic' experiments a continuous flow of reactants is passed through the chamber, gaseous products being purged. By the latter technique, the observation of adsorbate vibrations is not impeded by strong overlapping signals of gaseous products. Results In the following sections, diffuse reflectance FTIR spectra will be presented that were recorded on palladium/zirconia catalysts under a set of defined reaction conditions. Four major types of surface species have been observed, which were identified as surface carbonates, surface formate, adsorbed formaldehyde and methanol or surface-bound methylate, respectively. These intermediates have been identified by comparison with reference spectra in the literature, and by adsorption experiments in which the substrate under study was covered with the compound that was postulated to represent the surface intermediate. To facilitate interpretation of spectra recorded during the catalytic runs, the results from the adsorption of reference compounds will be reported first. Representative spectra of surface carbonates, formate, adsorbed for- maldehyde and methylates are presented below. Adsorption experiments of CO and COg on the zirconia support as well as on Pd (5 wt.%)/Zr02 are described in the subsequent section; the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide over palladium/zirconia is investigated thereafter. Copper/ zirconia catalysts prepared both from amorphous precursors and by preci- pitation will be discussed in Part II of this study. Vibrational spectra of adsorbed reference compounds Surface carbonates and surface formate Spectra of carbonates and formates bound to the surface of oxide supports have been reported in the literature [12]. In the form which is thermally stable up to higher temperatures, COg2\" is bound to the surface through a single oxygen ion, as a monodentate ligand. The second negative charge of COg2\" is delocalized over two partial double bonds, giving rise to two vibrations of comparatively low frequency. Ranges of 1420 1540 cm\"1 and 1330 1390 cm~1 are indicated in the literature [12]. In the bidentate form, which is generally less stable, carbonate is bound to the surface via two oxygen ion bridges. This geometry, with one double bond directed away from the surface, is characterized by a band in the 1600-1670 cm'' range, with the C 0 (single bond) stretching vibration between 1280 and 1310 cm\"1. On zirconia supports, surface-bound formate is characterized by a C H stretching vibration at 2875 cm~1, the asymmetric stretch of the carboxylate group at 1580 cm ', and the symmetric stretching vibration at 1370 cm\"1 [13]. Formaldehyde adsorption The C=0 stretching vibration of gaseous formaldehyde appears at a frequency of 1744 cm\"1; absorptions at 2874 and 2780 cm~1 are assigned to C-H stretching, and bands at 1503, 1280 and 1167 cm\"1 correspond to C H deformational vibrations [14]. Upon adsorption of formaldehyde on Pd/ZrOg from a 37% aqueous solution, which also contains some methanol as a stabilizer, one observes several absorptions in the room temperature spectrum (Fig. I): Bands centered at 2850, 1580 and 1370 cm~1 are due to surface formate; a weak band around 1050 cm\"' is assigned to the C 0 stretching vibration of methanol; and a band at 1620 cm\"1, which appears as a shoulder on the 1580 cm~1 band, originates from surface-bound water. Further signals are observed around 1850 and 1150 cm~1, the latter band of which is due to a surface-bound species arising from formaldehyde as the immediate precursor. To check whether these bands might be due to -S 473 K 423 K 373 K 323 K 298 K 3500 3250 3000 2750 2500 2250 2000 1750 1500 1250 1000 wavenumber / cm\"^ Fig. 1. Adsorption of formaldehyde on Pd (5 wt.%)/Zr02. The temperature dependence of the diffuse reflectance FTIR spectrum is monitored while a continuous stream of nitrogen saturated with formaldehyde is passed over the sample. 228 methanol or water adsorption, two further experiments were performed by introducing a methanol/water mixture and pure water, respectively. From the spectra shown in Fig. 2 it is seen that the absorptions at 1850 and 1150 cm\"1 do not appear at room temperature in the absence of formaldehyde. Therefore, likely species to which the two bands can be assigned are bridge- bound surface CO (C=0 stretching mode at 1850 cm\"1) and ir-bonded formaldehyde. In the latter species, both the carbon and the oxygen atoms of formaldehyde are bound to the surface, and essentially only a single bond remains between carbon and oxygen (cf. Discussion). For reference, note that during the adsorption of formaldehyde on Ru(OOl), two bands at 980 and 1180 cm\"1 have been observed by Anton et al. [15]. The authors have assigned the 980 cm~1 band to ^-bonded formaldehyde, and the 1180 cm~1 band to ^-HCO. (Note that an unusual increase in frequency was reported [15] for the 980 cm~1 band upon deuteration of HgCO). On copper catalysts, bands appearing at 1160 and 1130 cm~1 upon adsorption of formaldehyde were assigned to a dioxomethylene species [16]. 473 K 373 K 323 K 298 K 473 K 373 K 323 K 298 K 3500 3250 3000 2750 2500 2250 2000 1750 1500 1250 1000 wavenumber / cm\"* Fig. 2. Adsorption of a methanol/water (1:10) mixture Qower part), and of pure water (upper part) on a Pd (5 wt.%)/Zr02 catalyst surface. This control experiment supplements the adsorption of formaldehyde (Fig. 1) from a 37% aqueous solution containing methanol as a stabilizer. 229 The spectra in Figs. 1 and 2 (lower part) at elevated temperatures are almost identical, and reveal further surface reactions such as the formation of surface-bound CO and decomposition to gaseous carbon dioxide, starting at about 323 K. Surface-bound methanol Methanol and methylates are first identified by the observation of a characteristic doublet of symmetric and antisymmetric stretching vibrations of the CH3 group. These are found at 2950 and 2830 cm\"1 in solid CHaOH [17]; the range of variation for a variety of methylates is 3000 2910 cm~1 for the higher frequency band, and 2850 2830 cm~1 for the lower frequency band. The symmetric deformational motion ^(CHs) is observed between 1470 and 1450 cm\"1; the rocking vibration y(CH3) exhibits a frequency between 1170 and 1120 cm\"1. The C 0 stretching band occurs at 1034 cm~1 in gaseous methanol; this vibration has been assigned to frequencies in the range 1090-1010 cm-1 for various methylates [17]. The adsorption ofCHsOH on a Pd/ZrOg surface is shown in Fig. 3. The room temperature spectrum (bottom trace) was recorded after a flow of methanol in nitrogen carrier gas had been passed over the sample for 30 min. The most intense peaks are the 2950/2840 cm~1 doublet and the C 0 valence stretching vibration between 1000 and 1050 cm~1. We recognize, in addition, the 1580 and 1370 cm~1 bands of formate previously discussed, as well as the weak 1150 cm~1 band assigned to an adsorbed formaldehyde species (vide supra). These formate and formaldehyde bands originate in initial oxidation reactions during methanol adsorption at 298 K, which were studied in more detail as a function of time after methanol was admitted to the catalyst surface (Fig. 4). The 1150 cm\"1 band is immediately observed and decreases slightly with time, simultaneously with the appearance of a weak signal at 1750 cm~1 due to gaseous formaldehyde (cf. top trace). The bands between 1300 and 1650 cm~1 are due to a mixture of surface carbonate and formate, of which formate is the dominating surface species after 30 min. Upon raising the temperature to 323 K, the 1150 cm\"1 band and the formate bands increase significantly and persist up to about 473 K (Fig. 6). Furthermore, adsorbed CO, with absorptions between 1800 and 2000 cm\"1, and gas phase COg, evident from the intense peak at 2340 cm~1, develop at elevated temperatures. Finally, we attribute the bands at 1050 and 1017 cm~1 to R and P branches of the sharp Q-branch peak of gas phase methanol (C 0 stretching vibration at 1034 cm\" i). On comparing the intensities of the R and P branches, note that the relative intensity of the higher frequency band increases with temperature. However, for the R/P branch pair, the intensities should equalize as the temperature is raised. Thus apparently the 1050 cm~1 band is a superposition of two contributions. The C 0 signal of chemisorbed methylate, which appears at the same frequency as the R branch of gaseous methanol, becomes increasingly intense at higher temperatures. 230 473 K 423 K 373 K 323 K 298 K 3500 3250 3000 2750 2500 2250 2000 1750 1500 1250 1000 wavenumber / cm\"1 Fig. 3. Adsorption of methanol on Pd (5 wt.%)/Zr02. The temperature dependence of the surface FTIR spectrum was studied in a continuous flow of nitrogen saturated with methanol vapor (cf. Experimental). Prior to the temperature program, the methanol/Nz gas flow was passed over the sample for 30 min at room temperature. For comparison, an analogous adsorption experiment was performed using CDaOD; results are shown in Fig. 5. The C D stretching vibrations appear down-shifted to 2250 and 2075 cm~ i, in agreement with the literature [17]. SCCDy) appears at 1120 cm-1; -yCCDg) is reported [17] at 895 cm-1. The C 0 stretching vibration of CDsOD appears at 984 cm-1, also in agreement with the literature. Interestingly, an additional peak at 1135 cm~1 appears immediately upon adsorption of CD30D; upon raising the temperature this peak shifts to 1150 cm\" i, which is precisely the same frequency as with the protonated adsorbent, CHsOH. This observation is interpreted as follows. The absorption at 1135 cm-1 observed at short times is assigned to ^-bonded DgCO. At slightly elevated temperature this surface species is capable of exchanging hydrogen with the surface, and is converted into surface-bound DHCO and HgCO (1150 cm-1). This observation of isotope exchange supports the view than an tf- bonded species is essential for the hydrogen uptake in the reaction mechanism, 231 as 30 min 10 min 5 min 1 min 2000 1900 1800 1700 1600 1500 1400 1300 1200 1100 1000 wavenumber / cm~1 Fig. 4.

Changes in the absorptions due to surface species are monitored at room temperature, as a function of time after the carrier gas flow was switched from pure nitrogen to a saturated vapor of methanol in nitrogen. in the course of which carbon-bound surface CO is converted into oxygen- bound surface methoxide. The effect of an initial oxidation reaction is even more significant than with CHgOH; in the first minute, the introduced CDaOD is almost completely oxidized to the surface formaldehyde species, as evident from the fact that the i<C 0) gas phase signal (980 cm\"1) is not yet detectable (Fig. 6). As a function of time the 1135 cm\"1 band (formaldehyde) slowly decreases, and after 30 min the S^CDy) (1120 cm-1) and i<C-0) (980 cm-1) vibrations dominate the spectrum (upper trace). A comparison of the CHaOH and CDaOD adsorption experiments is useful in establishing the assignment for the C 0 stretching vibration of adsorbed methylate. For the gas phase species, this band is observed at 980 cm-1 for CDaOD, and at 1034 cm-' for CHaOH. In the CDsOD adsorption experiment, the 1010-1020 cm-1 band persisting between 373 and 473 K (Fig. 5) obviously corresponds to the C 0 stretching vibration of deuterated surface methylate.

The relevant bands are also listed in Table 1, Part II, for further reference. COg and CO adsorption on pure zirconia support and on zirconia impregnated with palladium COz on ZrO-s A first noteworthy feature is that the adsorbate spectrum is independent of the presence of Ha or Na as the carrier gas under reaction conditions. Adsorption of COg/Ng at atmospheric pressure reveals that both bidentate surface carbonate (1650, 1280 cm\"1) and the monodentate surface species (1430, 1320 cm\"1) are formed. The amount of bidentate carbonate present on the surface drops sharply as the temperature is raised to 473 K. COz/Nz on Pd f5 wt. /o)/ZrOy. Qualitatively, the same features are observed as for COg adsorbed on the zirconia support, with the exception of a comparatively higher surface concentration of monodentate carbonate (Fig. 7).

CO/Nz on ZrOz As in the COg adsorption experiment, bidentate as well as monodentate surface carbonates are detected upon CO adsorption, with intensities following an analogous temperature dependence. Even at 473 K no significant ab- sorptions other than those already discussed are observed. CO/N^ an, Pd (5 wt.%)/ZrOz At room temperature the same characteristics are observed as for COa adsorption, i.e. bands due to bidentate and monodentate carbonate. Fur- thermore, it is seen that CO is adsorbed in a bridge-bonded geometry (1950 cm\"1). At 373 K, triply-bonded CO can be detected in addition (1860 cnT1), and the carbonate bands decrease. Finally, at 473 K all carbonate has disappeared; a sharp doublet at 1580 and 1370 cm~1, characteristic of surface formate, is recognized instead (see above). In addition to the mentioned features, gaseous C02 (2340 cm\"1) is formed over the entire temperature 234 473 K 373 K 298 K 2000 1900 1800 1700 1600 1500 1400 1300 1200 1100 1000 wavenumber / cm\"1 Fig. 7.

Hydrogenation reactions over palladium/'zirconia catalysts Catalyst prepared from amorphous Pdz^Zr^ precursor The high hydrogenation activity of this catalyst has previously been characterized [11]. A COa/Hg mixture (1:4) reacts to completion under mild conditions, i.e. p=2 bar and T=453 K. Only gas phase methane, water and carbon monoxide are observed, and no surface species are detected (Fig. 8, bottom trace). In a static CO/Hg atmosphere at 453 K, COg, methane and methanol are formed (Fig. 8, second trace); water absorptions are weak. The charac- teristic doublet of methanol C H stretching vibrations (2950 and 2830 cm~1) coincides in frequency with the intense P branch of the gas phase CH4 spectrum. The methane signals can, however, be cancelled by subtraction of a carefully scaled spectrum resulting from COg hydrogenation, where CH4 236 as 3500 3250 3000 2750 2500 2250 2000 1750 1500 1250 1000 wavenumber / cm\"1 Fig. 8.

Spectra were recorded after mixtures of COa/Ha (1:4, bottom trace), and of CO/Hg (1:3, middle trace) had reacted for 10 min over the catalyst in the controlled environmental chamber at T= 453 K and a total pressure of 2 bar. When starting from COg (bottom), only gaseous CH4 and HaO are detected as products. With CO as the reactant, some methanol is formed in addition, as evidenced by the signals between 1000 and 1050 cm~1 (middle spectrum). The C H stretching vibrations of methanol become visible (top trace) when the methane contribution is cancelled, by computing a weighted difference of middle and bottom spectra. is the only product. Such a difference spectrum is also included m Fig. 8, in which the methanol peaks can be easily recognized. Catalyst containing 5 wt.% Pd on ZrOz prepared by wet impregnation In the flowing COz/H-s hydrogenation system at 473 K, intensive formate absorptions immediately appear. With increasing time (second trace in Fig. 9) some adsorbed CO is detected (Tbroad band between 1800 and 2000 cm\"1). Methane, CO and HgO are detected as gaseous products in the static system. No absorptions that would be indicative of methanol, i.e. bands around 2900 cm\"1 and in the range between 1000 and 1100 cm~1, are observed. 236 S 30 mm 5 min 1 min 3500 3250 3000 2750 2500 2250 2000 1750 1500 1250 1000 wavenumber / cm\"1 Fig. 9. COa hydrogenation on a Pd (5 wt.%)/2r02 catalyst. Initial surface reactions were studied after the carrier gas stream was switched from pure hydrogen to a COg/Hz (1:4) methanation mixture, at p=2.5 bar and r=473 K. It is helpful to consider the reaction of the surface species after the CC>2 reactant has been removed from the gas phase, by purging with pure Hg (p = 3 bar). Figure 10 shows two spectra taken 5 and 30 min, respectively, after the reaction mixture had been replaced by hydrogen. The formation of intense methane signals is observed; water absorptions are weak. The difference spectrum (top trace) reveals very clearly that the peaks of adsorbed formate and CO decrease as methane is formed. Experiments with CO/Hg at 473 K show that the catalyst has a large adsorption capacity for CO, as evidenced by the signal between 1800 and 2000 cm\"1, which is very intense when compared to the gas phase signal of CO at 2150 cm ~' (Fig. 11). Some gas phase COg and very strong absorptions of formate (1590 and 1370 cm\" ^ are observed. A few minutes later methylate and formaldehyde are detected. As before, the reaction of surface species was studied after the reaction mixture in the gas phase had been replaced by pure hydrogen (p=3 bar, T=473 K). The spectra taken after 10, 30 and 90 min show that the formate peaks decrease while methane is formed (Fig. 12, third trace from bottom). 237 30 min 5 min 3500 3250 3000 2750 2500 2250 2000 1750 1500 1250 1000 wavenumber / cm\"^ Fig. 10. Reactions of the species accumulated on the surface of a Pd (5 wt.%)/Zr02 catalyst under COg hydrogenation conditions. The hydrogenation of the surface species was studied after the flow was switched from COa/Hg (1:4) to pure Ha, at p=3 bar and 7'= 473 K. The decrease in the formaldehyde and methylate bands is almost negligible during the first 30 min of reaction. With longer times, a loss in intensity of the 1150 and 1050 cm\"1 bands becomes evident (Fig. 12, second trace from top). In addition, the difference between the spectra taken after 90 and 10 min (Fig. 12, top trace) exhibits no significant loss of adsorbed CO (1800-2000 cm\"1). After ~100 min, methylate and formaldehyde peaks have completely disappeared, but methane formation continues at the expense of both decreasing formate and adsorbed CO (Fig. 13). It thus appears that surface methylate has decomposed into adsorbed CO. From the experiments on impregnated palladium/zirconia catalysts, we can draw three major conclusions: Decrease in formate, but not in methylate and formaldehyde, is directly related with an increase in the gaseous CH4 product. Formate disappearance is not observed to be connected with the formation of formaldehyde, methylate or methanol. 238 30 min w 10 min -2 0.25 1 min 3500 3250 3000 2750 2500 2250 2000 1750 1500 1250 1000 wavenumber / cm\"1 Fig. 11. CO hydrogenation on a Pd (5 wt.%)/Zr02 catalyst. Initial surface reactions were studied after the carrier gas stream was switched from pure hydrogen to CO/Hz (1:2) reaction mixture, at p=2.5 bar and T=473 K. Methylate and formaldehyde formation on the surface are associated with the presence of gaseous CO. Observation of methylate and formaldehyde surface species is accompanied by the detection of adsorbed CO. Discussion During catalytic hydrogenations of COg and CO on palladium/zirconia catalysts prepared by wet impregnation, several reaction intermediates have been observed, depending on reactants and reaction conditions: With COg/Hg reaction mixtures, the catalytic reaction is characterized by rapid formation of surface formate and gas phase methane. No formaldehyde, methylate or methanol absorptions are observed under C02 hydrogenation conditions. Species that are unique to the CO/Hg system include surface methylate, methanol and surface formaldehyde. Note that the formation of these species proceeds considerably more slowly, and can always be correlated with the 239 -2 diff.4-1 90 min diff.2-1 30 min 10 min 3500 3250 3000 2750 2500 2250 2000 1750 1500 1250 1000 wavenumber / cm\"^ Fig. 12. Reactions of species accumulated on the surface of a Pd (6 wt.%)/ZrC>2 catalyst under CO hydrogenation conditions. The hydrogenation of the surface species was studied after the flow was switched from CO/Ha (1:2) to pure Hg, at p =3 bar and T=473 K. The difference between the spectra obtained after 30 and 10 min is shown in the middle trace; the difference between the spectra recorded after 90 and 10 min is represented by the top trace. presence of gaseous CO. For impregnated palladium/zirconia catalysts, for- maldehyde and methylate are only observed when starting from CO/Hg mixtures. Furthermore, during CO hydrogenations the instantaneous formation of some gas phase COg, together with surface formate, is detected. Importantly, there is no apparent correlation between methanol formation and a decrease in surface formate. Methane production, on the other hand, causes a decrease in surface formate as the immediate precursor. In contrast, methanol does not appear as an observable precursor of methane. On the catalyst derived from the amorphous Pd26Zr75 precursor, the only surface species detected with appreciable signal intensity is methylate, which is mainly observed during CO hydrogenation. The failure to detect other surface species on this catalyst might be correlated with its high activity: surface species are readily hydrogenated, and are therefore not accumulated in significant concentrations on the surface. 240 diff.3-1 180 min 120 min 100 min 3500 3250 3000 2750 2500 2250 2000 1750 1500 1250 1000 wavenumber / cm\"1 Fig. 13.

Proposed reaction scheme for the hydrogenation of CO and COa over zirconia-supported catalysts (cf. Discussion in the text). The observed correlations of surface and gas phase species are summarized in the reaction scheme of Fig. 14. Adsorbates are grouped around the reactants CO and COg which, in the presence of hydrogen, are interconverted on the catalyst surface by the water-gas shift reaction. 241 The left side of the diagram represents the observed reactions that produce methane via surface formate. We have so far not been able to establish unambiguously whether the latter intermediate is formed from surface carbonate, or from COg and Hg by some other mechanism (dashed arrows). In an experiment designed to elucidate this question, the catalyst surface was first loaded with carbonates by exposure to pure COg. Subsequently the gas phase was purged with nitrogen, and then hydrogen was admitted. In this experiment the formation of surface formate proceeds considerably more slowly, as compared to the situation where both COg and hydrogen are present in the gas phase. It thus appears that surface carbonate does not necessarily act as an intermediate in the formation of surface formate; rather, a direct pathway from COg and Hg appears to dominate. The right hand side of the diagram represents the suggested sequence of hydrogenation steps leading from adsorbed CO, via ir-bonded formaldehyde and methylate as the intermediates, to the gaseous methanol product. The importance of the two sides of the reaction scheme (methane and methanol paths) appears to depend largely on the structural properties of the zirconia-supported palladium catalyst. Although the present IR investi- gations reflect the earlier observed differences in selectivity behavior [11] of the differently prepared palladium/zirconia catalysts, they do not allow clarification of this point completely. In this context, attention is drawn to the interesting observation that CO is adsorbed more strongly on the palladium particles of the impregnated catalyst than on the palladium of the catalyst derived from amorphous Pd^r^. This behavior is attributed to the different structural and morphological properties of the impregnated catalyst, and the catalyst derived from amorphous Pd Zr. These differences concern both the structure of the zirconia and the palladium-zirconia interface [18]. In the catalyst prepared by wet impregnation, the crystalline palladium particles are in relatively loose contact with the support Qarge contact angle, poor wetting), and consequently form a comparatively small interfacial area with the crystalline and stoichiometric zirconia. In contrast, in the palladium/ zirconia catalysts derived from amorphous Pd Zr alloys, the small palladium particles are intermeshed in the surrounding amorphous zirconia phase, forming an extremely large interfacial area. Regarding the metal particle size, the results of Fajula et al. [19] should be mentioned. These authors have suggested that on small palladium particles CO is weakly adsorbed, which leads mainly to methanol formation, while on larger palladium particles, CO is adsorbed more strongly and preferentially forms methane under CO hydrogenation conditions. Whereas this influence of the palladium particle size may be one important factor in the explanation of the different selectivities, the situation is even more complex for the two catalysts investigated in this study, as the structural and chemical properties of the interface and of the zirconia also largely differ between the two systems. In the catalyst derived from Pd Zr, part of the zirconia exists as oxygen-deficient ZrOg-a; [20]. For a final answer concerning the origin of the different selectivities observed, the role of these oxygen vacancies for 242 the two reaction paths (methane, methanol) needs to be clarified. Further work in this direction is presently underway in our laboratories. References 1 K. Klier, Adv. Catal., 31 (1982) 243. 2 M. Bowker, H. Houghton and K. C. Waugh, J. Chem.

Baiker Department of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, ETH Zentrum, CH-8092 ZurichSwitzerland Hydrogenation reactions over zirconia-supported palladium catalysts have been investigated by diffuse reflectance FTIR spectroscopy. Catalysts obtained by activation of an amorphous Pd25Zr75 precursor, as well as catalysts prepared by wet impregnation of zirconia, were characterized in flowing CO/H2 or CO2/H2 reactant gases, respectively, in the temperature range 298–473 K. In addition, species present on the catalyst surface under equilibrated conditions were studied in the static system, after the gas flow was terminated. Supplementary information was obtained by studying the surface reactions occurring when the catalyst was first exposed to reaction conditions, and subsequently to a stream of pure hydrogen. Surface species were identified by comparison with adsorption studies in which the catalysts were loaded with reference compounds (CO2, formaldehyde, methanol and methanol-d4), and the surface spectrum recorded as a function of temperature. Upon exposure to CO2/H2, rapid formation of surface formate was observed. Similarly, CO was rapidly transformed to formate upon initial adsorption onto the surface of the activated catalysts. The disappearance of formate, as observed in the FTIR spectrum, could be correlated with the appearance of gas phase methane. A second major route of surface reactions, which proceeds from CO/H2 mixtures, involves adsorbed CO, π-bonded formaldehyde, surface-bound methylate, and gas phase methanol as the product. Interestingly, there was no observable correlation between adsorbed formaldehyde or methylate on the one hand, and gas phase methane on the other hand. The steps involved in the surface reactions on zirconia and palladium/zirconia are discussed in detail, by comparison with the reactions observed when the catalysts were exposed to reference compounds relevant to the reaction mechanism.
