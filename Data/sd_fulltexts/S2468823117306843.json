Graphical abstract Synthesis of Cu-ZnO catalysts for the direct hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol requires catalyst precursors able to display a strong Cu-Zn interaction. Copper and zinc mixed hydroxynitrates are good candidates to fulfill this specification. The synthesis of such a phase was achieved by a wet impregnation of copper nitrate on ZnO. Solvent evaporation and catalyst drying at moderate temperatures allowed retaining the metals hydroxynitrate structure, leading to a memory effect for the reduced catalysts. Depending on the Cu content in the reaction mixture, a ZnO lixiviation gradually occurs, what induces an important change in the morphology of the reduced catalyst. Catalyst activity is proportional to the amount of Zn migrated in the active phase, the latter consisting most probably of an oxygen deficient mixed oxide comprising both Cu and Zn. The most active catalyst is obtained when ZnO is fully lixiviated during the catalyst precursor synthesis, giving a core-shell structure after reduction. Keywords Copper Zinc oxide Chemical memory Morphology change Methanol synthesis 1 Introduction Methanol synthesis from CO2 (Eq. (1)) is a reaction of paramount importance in the perspective of a methanol economy [1]. This exothermal reaction is favored at low temperature and high pressure. To be economically viable, this process requires the use of efficient and stable catalysts consisting of earth abundant transition metals, involving a simple, economic and sustainable synthesis. (1) CO2 + 3H2 ⇌ CH3OH + H2O In particular, the Cu-ZnO system is a good candidate to fulfill these specifications. The activity of these catalysts relies on the Cu-ZnO synergy that leads to the creation of active sites for this hydrogenation reaction. The associated mechanism for the creation of active sites has been long discussed and can be summarized as follows. Initial contacts between CuO and ZnO crystallites prior to catalyst reduction [2] are at the origin of the creation of an heterojunction [3] which makes the ZnO more reducible [4] and favors the formation of an oxygen deficient layer of ZnOx [5]. Then, a cross migration of Cu and Zn according to the Kirkendall effect [6] engenders a surface Zn enrichment what correlates to the catalyst activity [7–9]. In a macroscopic point of view, the catalyst morphology is crucial. An efficient catalyst needs a maximization of the Cu-ZnO interface [10] what can be achieved by designing core-shell structures [9]. To date, several active phase precursors were described. Generally, catalysts are synthesized trough the co-precipitation of Cu2+ and Zn2+ salts with a carbonate precipitating agent. This leads to different hydroxycarbonate precursors such as zincian malachite [11,12], georgite [13], rosacite and aurichalcite [14]. The strategy is to take the benefit of a memory effect (chemical memory) of the carbonate salt after the catalyst reduction. However, other precursor than carbonate salts can also be used. For instance, copper and zinc mixed hydroxynitrates [15,16] are potentially ideal candidates to favor the critical Cu-Zn initial interface. These hydroxynitrates are layered hydroxide salts (LHS) whose structure derives from the Brucite like structure [17]. This layered packing of 2D assemblies is well suited for the obtaining of large specific surface areas. This type of precursor has been studied for the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol, where a similar memory effect has been observed [18]. This study showed that a calcination step before catalyst reduction partially destroys the interaction between CuII and ZnII. The extent of the Cu0-ZnII interaction after reduction is governed by the basicity of the support which favors the formation of hydroxy-compound during further impregnation with copper or copper-zinc nitrate [19]. A recent example on the use of copper-zinc mixed hydroxynitrates for the methanol synthesis from syngas on SiO2 supported catalysts showed catalytic performances close to the industrial catalyst Cu-ZnO/Al2O3 [20]. In this example, the hydroxynitrate precursor is decomposed under an NO atmosphere. In this work, we report on the use of copper-zinc hydroxynitrates with ZnO as the basic oxide support for the obtaining of the catalyst precursor for the methanol synthesis from CO2. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Catalyst synthesis The different catalysts were prepared by a wet impregnation of an aqueous solution containing the copper nitrate salt solution and a commercial ZnO powder (Sigma-Aldrich) under stirring for 5 h at room temperature. The amount of copper nitrate was adjusted to obtain the desired amount of Cu in the catalyst. The resulting solution containing the impregnated support was evaporated at 70 °C and dried at 100 °C for 15 h. The catalyst was finally pressed (7 t), crushed in a mortar (5 min), and sieved to particle size fractions (0.40–0.20 mm) used for testing measurements. 2.2 ICP Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) optical emission spectroscopy was used for the determination of the metal content in each sample synthesized. The measurements were performed with a Perkin Elmer Optima 2000DV spectrometer. The sample was previously dissolved in an acidic mixture of HNO3 and HCl. 2.3 XRD In situ XRD-monitored reduction was performed in a Bruker-Nonius D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer equipped with an Anton-Paar XTK 16 reaction chamber. The powder catalyst was loaded in the chamber and a first X-ray diffractogram was acquired at room temperature for the as prepared catalyst. Then, the catalyst was heated with flowing 3% H2/He up to 350 °C (heating rate 5 °C min−1, flow rate 30 mL min−1) and kept at this temperature for 1 h in order to mimic the activation treatment performed in situ prior to the methanol synthesis catalytic tests. X-ray diffractograms were acquired after reduction at room temperature in the 2θ range 20°–80° (step size of 0.05°, scan speed 1 s step−1) using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å). Rietveld refinements were performed on reduced catalysts using HighScore Plus software. More details can be found in supporting information S1. 2.4 TEM-EDX Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) was performed with a Jeol 2100 UHR microscope at 20 kV, which was equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX). Reduced catalysts (with 30 mL min−1 of H2 at 350 °C during 1 h, heating rate 5 °C min−1) were ground in a mortar, the powder was suspended in ethanol under sonication for 5 min and loaded on holey carbon film Au grid (300 mesh). 2.5 Catalytic tests Methanol synthesis catalytic tests were performed in a continuous fixed-bed stainless steel reactor (L = 400 mm, Øint = 12.5 mm). Before the CO2 hydrogenation reaction, the catalyst (0.50 g, 0.40–0.20 mm sieve fraction) was reduced in situ at 350 °C. Then, the reaction was carried out at 250 °C and 30 bar of the reactant gas mixture ((H2:CO2 = 3:1, vol., GHSV = 18 000 h−1). Under these experimental conditions, CO2 conversion is ≤ 2%. Reaction products were analyzed with an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph (GC) connected online. Detection limits are 0.65% and 0.44% for methanol and CO, respectively. Quantification limits are 2.16% and 1.47% for methanol and CO, respectively. CO2 conversion is calculated from the CO + methanol carbon mass balance. According to the detection limits for CO, no CO signal detected means methanol selectivity comprised between 95% and 100%. Methanol rate is calculated from the average of 4 consecutive GC injections. Typically, the relative standard deviation is comprised between 0.5% and 3%. More experimental details can be found elsewhere [6]. 3 Results and discussion A series of five impregnated catalysts whose Cu content is ranging from 1 to 38% (as determined from ICP measurements) was prepared. The wet impregnation method consists in mixing a copper nitrate aqueous solution with a commercial ZnO powder. The increasing amount of copper nitrate results in the decrease of the reaction mixture pH (Table 1 ) due to the dissociation of the acidic [Cu(H2O)6]2+ complex, as shown in Eq. (2). (2) [ C u ( H 2 O ) 6 ] ( a q ) 2 + ⇆ [ C u ( H 2 O ) 5 ( O H ) ] ( a q ) + + H ( a q ) + Fig. 1 show the XRD patterns of the as prepared catalysts after solvent evaporation at 70 °C and drying at 100 °C. It has to be noticed that no additional calcination step was carried out in order to retain any possible memory effect of the catalyst precursor [18]. Significant differences in terms of crystallographic structure along the series are observed (JCPDS files can be found in supporting information Table S1). Copper is identified to crystallize in the form of a copper hydroxynitrate (Cu2(NO3)(OH)3) whereas zinc can be found in its oxide form (ZnO) as well as in nitrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O) and hydroxynitrate form (Zn5(NO3)2(OH)8·2H2O). The ZnO signal vanishes when the copper content in the catalyst is ranging between 19 and 38%. This is explained by a lixiviation of ZnO induced by the low pH of the reaction mixture and is further activated during the solvent evaporation step at 70 °C. The consequence of the gradual ZnO lixiviation is that copper salt is both impregnated on the remaining oxide support and dispersed in a mixture of zinc nitrate and hydroxynitrate. Although separate hydroxynitrate phases for Zn and Cu were indexed, it cannot be ruled out that a mixed hydroxynitrate of general formula Cu2-xZnx(NO3)(OH)3 is formed. Indeed, this kind of mixed hydroxynitrate has the same type of structure as Cu2(NO3)(OH)3 [18]. Fig. 2 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of reduced catalysts. All diffraction lines can be indexed either to the face centered cubic crystalline phase of Cu or hexagonal ZnO crystalline phase. No additional peaks have been observed indicating the high purity of reduced samples. Rietveld refinement was performed for each reduced sample so as to obtain information regarding the crystalline structure, the crystallite sizes, as well as microstrains affecting different phases composing each catalyst. The methodology used is detailed in supporting information S1. In each case a good agreement between calculated and experimental patterns was observed (see supporting information Fig. S1). This is confirmed by low reliability factors (see supporting information Table S2) calculated according to relations given by Young [21]. Crystallite sizes for Cu and ZnO phases as well as microstrain affecting ZnO lattice have been determined for each reduced catalyst, as a result of the best fit. Results are presented in Fig. 3 . Microstrains are non-uniform strains associated with shifts of atoms from their equilibrium position. This displacement is responsible for broadening of diffraction lines. Conversely, isostatic strains are associated with the expansion or contraction of the unit cell and no peak broadening is associated with this kind of strain, which are only associated to a peak shift (variation of lattice constant). It can be observed from Fig. 3a that the magnitude of microstrain strongly increases for samples containing more than 10 wt.% Cu. That means that point defects are created in ZnO phase for high Cu content samples. These defects engender locally generated stresses. From Fig. 3b, it can be observed that copper crystallite only slightly evolves from one sample to another. There is only a small increase in the size of coherently diffracting domains for sample containing more than 10 wt.% of copper from 32 nm up to 47 nm. At the same time, it is observed that ZnO crystallite size gradually decreases (Fig. 3c) upon increasing the copper content in the nominal composition of the catalyst. It is in fact of 122 nm for the 5 wt.% copper containing catalyst and reaches the remarkably low value of 40 nm for the 40 wt.% copper containing material. The consequence of this decrease is the increase of the Cu-ZnO concentration of contacts, which will provide an increased amount of catalytic sites. The weight percent of each phase was also determined using Rietveld refinement results. Results are shown in supporting information Table S2. After reduction with hydrogen at 350 °C, the amount of metallic copper as determined from XRD patterns deviates significantly from the total amount of Cu determined from ICP, especially for Cu content above 10% as shown on Fig. 4 . This indicates that a non-negligible amount of copper is not under the metallic state and remains under an amorphous form that cannot be detected by XRD. This deviation starting from 10% Cu agrees well with the increase of microstrain on the ZnO lattice (Fig. 3a), indicating that an amorphous ZnO type phase containing non-negligible amounts of Cu is probably formed, although oxygen vacancies formation in the oxide lattice is likely to be an additional feature of this microstrain increase. Zn atoms are substituted with Cu atoms resulting in a Zn-Cu mixed oxide, which can be most probably described by a CuxZn1-xOy phase, as already proposed earlier [9]. The evolution of the copper lattice constant determined from Rietveld refinements of XRD patterns of reduced catalysts allows determining the amount of Zn that has migrated into Cu to form a brass type alloy [2]. Detailed calculation can be found in supporting information S2. Fig. 5 shows that the highest the Cu content in the catalyst, the highest the Zn migration. This observation is in line with the decrease of the ZnO crystallite size (Fig. 3c) with Cu content which in turn increases the concentration of contacts between Cu and ZnO and consequently favors the migration of Zn [6]. The determination of the amount of Zn migrated is known to be an indirect method to estimate the catalyst activity for the methanol synthesis reaction [9] due to the fact that this migration is at the origin of the active site creation. Another method consisting on the determination of surface Zn enrichment has also been recently proposed [22]. Their calculations evidenced that the amount of surface Zn is strongly dependent on the ZnO crystallite size. This evolution, experimentally presented in Fig. 3c, is therefore consistent with our own observations. In both cases, a large amount of Zn migrated (or surface Zn) is necessary for the obtaining of a highly active catalyst. The metallic Cu specific surface area (SCu) can be derived from the evolution of the copper crystallite size (Fig. 3b) by assuming a fcc crystalline truncated octahedron structure. The equilibrium shape of fcc metal particle depends on its size [23]. Molecular dynamics can be used to seek the shape corresponding to minimal energy for constructions of different sizes. Many calculations of this kind have been carried out and showed that the three main shapes that arise for fcc metal are the icosahedron, the truncated decahedron and the truncated octahedron [23–25]. In the case of Cu, these calculations show that for very small sized Cu clusters (< 1000 atoms i.e around 3 nm) the non-crystalline icosahedron structure is the most stable shape. Then, beyond a certain cluster size (> 1000 atoms), the equilibrium shape changes from an icosahedron to a non-crystalline truncated decahedron structure and finally, for a large size (>50000 atoms i.e around 10 nm), the equilibrium shape changes from a non-crystalline truncated decahedron structure to a fcc crystalline truncated octahedron structure. In this work, the range of the determined Cu crystallite size varies between 32 and 47 nm indicating that the fcc truncated octahedron (denoted TO) structure is the most stable shape. The fcc TO shape (Fig. 6 ) has 14faces (8 regular hexagonal and 6 square), 36 edges, and 24 corners (or vertices). By using the Van Hardeveld and Hartog model [26] to determine the surface atom statistics and a methodology recently proposed on platinum clusters [27] to determine the fraction of surface atoms exposed by a geometrical approach, it is possible to obtain the metallic specific surface area (SCu) of the TO crystallite for a given m (m is the number of atoms lying on an equivalent edge, corner atoms included, of the chosen crystallite), with the following equation (Eq. (3)): (3) S C u = ( S C 6 + S C 7 ( H − S ) + S C 7 ( H − H ) + S C 8 + S C 9 ) × X C u 4 3 π × ( d C u 2 ) 3 × N T × ρ C u where ρCu and XCu represent the density of Cu (8.960 g cm−3) and the mass fraction of Cu into the catalyst, respectively. The detailed calculation of all other parameters can be found in supporting information S3. The results obtained for the catalysts used in this work are shown in Table S5. SCu is surprisingly following the same trend as the Zn migration, as shown on Fig. 7 . Those two values are interdependent as can be seen in Fig. S4. In this sense, a high value of SCu will implicate efficient hydrogen dissociation and consequently an important feedstock of dissociated hydrogen available for the active sites through hydrogen spillover. TEM images as well as EDX analyses (supporting information Table S6) were performed on the different catalysts after reduction with hydrogen (Fig. 8 ). For catalysts containing low amount of Cu (<10%) (1% Fig. 8a–c, 5% Fig. 8d,e and 10% Fig. 8f,g), 15–20 nm Cu rich (82–88%) spherical particles containing 2–3% of Zn as well as 13–15% of oxygen are observed (EDX spots 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 10). Those particles correspond to Cu particles encapsulated with ZnO. Some particles tend to a CuO composition with some incorporated Zn (spot 5). The interface between these particles and the ZnO support is a thin layer of ZnOx (spots 3, 9 and 11) whose formation can be explained by a wetting effect and resulting in the creation of oxygen defects [4,28]. A pronounced morphology change is observed for Cu content higher than 10% (19% Fig. 8h–i and 38% Fig. 8 j–l). A filamentous structure (spot 14) containing mostly Cu (62%), Zn (9%) and oxygen in under-stoechiometric amount (29%) appears. This structure can correspond to Cu2O, Cu and ZnO or to a mixed oxide of the type CuxZn1-xOy but with high amount of Zn. The latter can even reach values as high as 20–25% (spots 12, 17 and 18). The oxygen deficient ZnOx phase is still observed (spot 13) on the catalyst containing 19% Cu, this sample being an intermediate structure where the morphology change is not fully achieved. The most surprising is that this active phase is now supported on metallic Cu particles of ca. 100 nm (spots 15 and 16). This morphology change finally leads to the formation of core-shell like particles consisting of a Cu core and a CuxZn1-xOy mixed oxide shell. The structure modification agrees well with the sudden increase of the microstrain on ZnO (Fig. 3a) as well as the difference between the amount of metallic Cu and the total amount of Cu (Fig. 4), highlighting that a significant amount of Cu is located in the amorphous active phase. This switch of support from ZnO to Cu can be explained by the ZnO lixiviation in acidic media. During the synthesis, Zn2+ becomes dispersed together with Cu2+ in the hydroxynitrate form which is the precursor for the obtaining of the Zn rich CuxZn1-xOy phase after reduction. This active phase grows onto metallic Cu particles which are formed during the reduction step with hydrogen. Catalytic tests were performed with a H2: CO2 (3:1) feed gas at 250 °C and 30 bar. Under these experimental conditions, no CO was detected and the sole reaction product was methanol. The hourly rate of methanol formation per kg of catalyst (rMeOH) increases monotonically with the amount of Cu in the catalyst (Fig. 9 ), what is consistent with the Zn migration as well as the Cu specific surface area. A rate as high as 7 mol h−1 kg−1 is attained for the 38% Cu containing catalyst. A slight change in the slope is observed around 10% Cu, what corresponds to the catalyst morphology change. Below 10% Cu, the active phase is mostly supported on ZnO, whereas above 10% Cu, it is supported on Cu. The lower slope above 10% Cu can be explained by the slight increase of the Cu crystallite size. In the meantime, the Zn content in the active phase becomes higher what tends to show that there is probably an optimal amount of Zn in the active phase, or that a limiting thickness is reached. As the variation of the Cu crystallite size with the catalyst composition is moderate, the driving force for the active phase creation is mostly the ZnO crystallite size. The direct consequence is a largest amount of Zn migrated and finally a higher Zn surface coverage what tends to increase the catalyst activity. As the Cu specific surface area and Zn migrated are evolving similarly as the methanol rate, it is useful to determine the specific activities referred to accessible Cu and to the amount of Zn migrated by using Eqs. (4) and (5), respectively [6]. (4) T O F C u = r M e O H × M C u ( D × 0.01 ) × X C u (5) T O F Z n = r M e O H Z n m i g where rMeOH, MCu, D, and XCu, are the methanol rate in mol h−1 kg−1, the copper molar weight, the copper dispersion (see Table S5), and the mass fraction of Cu in reduced catalyst, respectively. The evolution of TOFCu and TOFZn shown on Fig. 10 a,b clearly highlight the interdependency between the accessible Cu and the amount of Zn migrated. The intrinsic activity of the active site evolves also with the catalyst morphology, as can be seen by the sudden TOF decrease at ca. 10 wt.% Cu. The active site chemical environment is therefore not equivalent before and after the morphology change. 4 Conclusions A series of Cu-ZnO catalysts for the methanol synthesis from CO2 have been synthesized by using the wet impregnation method of copper nitrate salt on a ZnO oxide support. Increasing amount of copper nitrate decreases the reaction mixture pH leading to the lixiviation of ZnO. The basic character of ZnO favors the formation of hydroxynitrate precursors containing both CuII and ZnII, which are structures favoring the CuII − ZnII interaction. Solvent evaporation, catalyst drying and reduction allows retaining the memory effect of the hydroxynitrate precursors and leads to the formation of active sites. The final morphology of the catalyst is closely dependent on the copper amount. A spectacular morphology change occurs around 10% Cu where an amorphous and filamentous active phase most probably consisting of CuxZn1-xOy appears. This active phase initially supported on ZnO becomes Cu supported after the morphology change leading to a core-shell structure. The increase of the catalytic activity follows the amount of Zn migrated as well as the Cu specific surface area, which are interdependent, and a catalytic activity as high as 7 molMeOH h−1 kg−1 is attained for the 38% Cu containing catalyst. The chemical environment of the active site is not equivalent before and after the morphology change. In summary, our study provides insights on the rational design of catalysts by taking the advantage of the memory effect of the catalyst precursors where a strong metal oxide interaction as well as a macroscopic structuration is needed.

Copper and zinc mixed hydroxynitrates are good candidates to fulfill this specification. The synthesis of such a phase was achieved by a wet impregnation of copper nitrate on ZnO. Solvent evaporation and catalyst drying at moderate temperatures allowed retaining the metals hydroxynitrate structure, leading to a memory effect for the reduced catalysts. Depending on the Cu content in the reaction mixture, a ZnO lixiviation gradually occurs, what induces an important change in the morphology of the reduced catalyst. Catalyst activity is proportional to the amount of Zn migrated in the active phase, the latter consisting most probably of an oxygen deficient mixed oxide comprising both Cu and Zn. The most active catalyst is obtained when ZnO is fully lixiviated during the catalyst precursor synthesis, giving a core-shell structure after reduction.",
