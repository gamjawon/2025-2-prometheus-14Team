Tel/Fax: +86-571-88273283 Glycerol carbonate (GC) was synthesized via the catalytic transesterification of glycerol with dimethyl carbonate over a series of Mg-Al hydrotalcites with different Mg/Al ratios (0.5–6) under mild conditions. All catalysts exhibited a high selectivity toward GC. The sample with Mg/Al = 2 exhibited 97.1% of selectivity toward GC and 66.9% of glycerol conversion at 70 °C for 3 h. Characterization results indicated that the activity of calcined Mg-Al hydrotalcites depended mainly on the surface area, pore diameter, and crystallinity. Graphical Abstract The transesterification of glycerol with dimethyl carbonate was catalyzed by a series of Mg-Al hydrotalcites with different Mg/Al ratios (0.5–6) under mild conditions. The hydrotalcite with Mg/Al = 2 is the most active catalyst for this reaction Keywords Glycerol Glycerol carbonate Transesterification Magnesium-Aluminum hydrotalcite 1 Introduction With the rapid consumption of fossil fuels and increasing concerns about greenhouse gas emissions, the use of renewable feedstocks with low CO2 emissions as alternative energy sources has attracted much attention [1,2]. Among the alternative renewable energy sources reported, the sustainable production of biodiesel from biomass has led many governments to increase production for economic and environmental reasons [3]. However, the growing production of biodiesel through the transesterification of triglycerides with methanol generates a large surplus of glycerol as a major byproduct. In turn, the catalytic conversion of glycerol to valuable products has recently become a hot research topic. Several products, such as 1,2-propanediol [4–10], dihydroxyacetone [11,12], acrolein [13], hydroxyacetone [14], glycerol carbonate (GC) [15–17] can be synthesized from glycerol. Among these products, GC is one of the most attractive derivatives of glycerol because of its high reactivity with alcohols, amines, carboxylic acids, ketones, and isocyanates, and can yield a wide range of valuable products. GC itself can be used as a solvent in NMR analysis and in organic synthesis. In addition, it has been reported that GC is an important alternative in lithium batteries, cosmetics, surfactants and polymer synthesis [18]. Several routes for obtaining GC from glycerol are known. Phosgenation between glycerol and phosgene [19], direct carbonylation of glycerol with CO2 [20,21] and the glycerolysis of urea [22,23] have been proposed. However, these methods have disadvantages because of the toxicity and corrosive nature of the feed materials and/or thermodynamic limitations (reversibility of the reaction) toward the formation of GC. The direct reaction between glycerol and CO2 is an attractive route, but it must be performed at high pressure and the yield of GC is reported to be very low. More recently, Li et al. [24] found that GC could be synthesized from CO2 and glycerol over La2O2CO3-ZnO in acetonitrile with the yield of GC reaching a maximum of 14.3% at 30.3% glycerol conversion. Transesterification of glycerol with dimethyl carbonate (DMC) is also an attractive way to produce GC under mild conditions [15,17,25]. It was reported that K2CO3 [26], CaO [27], and Mg/Al/Zr mixed oxides were effective for this reaction [28], but these catalysts had drawbacks regarding recyclability, reusability, and/or the need for complicated pretreatment. Recently, Pan et al. [25] disclosed that the rate of this reaction depended mainly on the basicity of the catalyst; but elsewhere it was found that the selectivity to GC decreased when a strong base (such as NaOH, KOH, K2CO3) was added because of the formation of glycidol [29]. We also found that the pore diameter of the solid base exerted a large influence on the activity and product distribution [25]. Hydrotalcite is a layered double hydroxide (LDH) with general formula [M2+ 1-x M3+ x (OH)2] x+ [A n– x /n ] x– .mH2O where M2+ is a divalent metal such as Mg, Zn, Ni, Co or Cu, M3+ is a trivalent metal such as Al, Cr, Fe or Ga [30]. The distance between lamellas in the LDH is usually larger than 0.8 nm. LDH is popularly used as a solid base catalyst. In this work, the transesterification reaction between glycerol and DMC was performed over a series of Mg-Al hydrotalcites with different Mg/Al ratios (0.5–6) under mild conditions, and the activity of these hydrotalcites and their structure was discussed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation Mg-Al hydrotalcites (Mg/Al = 0.5–6) were prepared by a conventional coprecipitation method. Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (25–300 mmol) and Al(NO3)3·9H2O (50 mmol) were dissolved in 400 mL water (solution A). Solution B was a mixed aqueous solution of NaOH (0.25 mol/L) and Na2CO3 (0.8 mol/L). Solution A and B were simultaneously added to a 2 L beaker under vigorous stirring at room temperature with the pH of the mixture being controlled at 9.4–9.6 during the addition. The resulting suspension was aged at 120 °C for 12 h, filtered and the residue washed thoroughly with distilled water (4 L) until the pH of the filtrate reached 7.0. The precipitate was dried at 110 °C overnight and calcined at 200–600 °C for 4 h. The composition of the Mg-Al hydrotalcites was determined using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). 2.2 Characterization Thermogravimetric differential scanning (TG-DSC) analysis of the prepared samples from RT to 700 °C was carried out on a Netzsch STA409 thermobalance system using a heating rate of 10 °C/min under N2. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Rigaku D/MAX-2500 diffractometer with a 2θ range of 5°–80° using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of catalysts were obtained using an accelerating voltage of 200 kV (JEOL-2020 F). N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm was measured at −196 °C using a TriStar II analyzer after pretreatment of the sample at 150 °C for 10 h. The pore size distribution was calculated using BJH method. The basicity of the catalyst was determined via temperature programmed desorption of CO2 (CO2-TPD) on an AMI-200 (Zeton Altamira) system. CO2 in effluent was calibrated using an external standard method [31, 32]. 2.3 Catalytic reactions Controlled amounts of DMC (135 mmol), methanol (7 mL) and glycerol (43.8 mmol) were mixed in a 100 mL round bottomed three-neck jacketed glass reactor fitted with a magnetic stirrer and a reflux condenser. The mixture was first heated under stirring to the desired temperature (30–70 °C) and catalyst (0.45 g) was added to start the reaction. After reaction for 3 h, the solid catalyst was removed by centrifuging the contents and the supernatant liquid was analyzed using a flame ionization detector gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, 14B) equipped with a 30-m capillary column (DB-WAX 52 CB, USA). All products detected in the liquid were verified by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry system (GC-MS, Agilent 6890) and quantified via an external calibration method. The product selectivity was calculated on a carbon basis. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst characterization 3.1.1 XRD result Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of freshly precipitated Mg-Al catalysts. All the classical diffraction peaks of the LDH (JCPDS 00-041-1428) could be detected in all samples; hydrotalcite is the main phase in all of the solid catalysts. It was confirmed that mainly perfectly structured hydrotalcite was formed in the samples with Mg/Al = 2 or 4. Other phases, such as Mg5(CO3)4(OH)2·4H2O (JCPDS 00-025-0513) in Mg/Al = 6, Al(OH)3 (JCPDS 00-033-0018) in Mg/Al = 1 and AlO(OH) (JCPDS 00-049-0113) in Mg/Al = 0.5, appeared in those samples with Mg/Al > 4 or Mg/Al < 1. Figure 1(b) shows the XRD patterns of Mg-Al catalysts calcined at 400 °C. The peaks assigned to the (003), (006), and (012) diffractions of fresh LDH disappeared with concomitant formation of MgO due to the loss of water, carbonate and hydroxide. These results indicate that the formation of a perfect LDH structure should be favored for a Mg/Al ratio of 2–4. 3.1.2 TG-DSC result Figure 2 shows the TG-DSC curves of the as-synthesized Mg/Al = 2 hydrotalcite. The TG curve indicates three main weight losses at 30–218, 218–311 and 400–700 °C. The first stage is attributed to the removal of adsorbed water, the second stage was due to the loss of bound water or carbonate in the interlayer of the LDH [33], and the last step was attributed to the further removal of hydroxyl groups [34,35]. 3.1.3 Structure and basicity The textural structure and the basicity of calcined (at 400 °C for 4 h) Mg/Al hydrotalcites are summarized in Table 1 . It can be found that the surface area and average pore diameter of these samples decreased gradually from 216 m2/g and 23.7 nm (Mg/Al = 1) to 127.4 m2/g and 13.1 nm (Mg/Al = 6), respectively. The calculated surface density of basic sites increased from 0.62 to 5.48 µmol/m2 when the Mg/Al ratio was increased from 0.5 to 6. 3.1.4 TEM result Figure 3 shows typical TEM images of samples calcined at 400 °C for 4 h. Some LDH lamellas of various sizes (45–150 nm, see Fig. 3(a)-2, (a)-3) and an Al2O3 phase (see Fig. 3(a)-1) could be observed in the samples with a low content of Mg (Mg/Al = 0.5). The orderliness and size of these solid LDH lamellas noticeably increased in the sample with Mg/Al = 2, and the thickness of these lamellas was 11–12 nm. However, separated MgO particles can be clearly seen in the sample with Mg/Al = 6 (Fig. 3(c)). These images are consistent with the XRD results. The images of Mg-Al hydrotalcites before and after calcination were further compared in Fig. 4 . It was found that the outline of solid LDH lamellas is similar in both samples, while the lattice fingers in a fresh sample (Fig. 4(a)-2) are clearer than that in the calcined sample. These results indicate that the thermal stability of the solid lamellas is relatively high. 3.2 Catalytic activity 3.2.1 The influence of the Mg/Al ratio Table 2 summarizes the activity of calcined (at 400 °C for 4 h) Mg-Al LDHs with different Mg/Al ratios for the transesterification reaction between glycerol and DMC conducted at 70 °C. The conversions of glycerol increased rapidly from 12.6% to 66.9% when Mg/Al ratio increased from 0.5 to 2, with the selectivity toward GC remaining at 97% above. However, the conversion of glycerol decreased on those samples with higher Mg/Al ratios (> 4). These results indicated that the activity of calcined Mg-Al LDHs depended mainly on basicity, surface area, pore diameter and crystallinity [25]. It is concluded that those catalysts having a mid-range density of basic sites, large pore channels and higher crystallinity are more suitable for this reaction. 3.2.2 Effect of temperature The conversion of glycerol increased quickly from 9.0% to 66.9% when the reaction temperature was raised from 30 to 70 °C and the selectivity towards GC decreased slightly from 97.9% to 97.1% (see Table 3 ). The decreased selectivity is attributed to basic sites that increase the decomposition of GC to glycidol (GLYc) at high temperature [29,36]. The results indicate that a higher temperature might cause higher glycerol conversion but lower selectivity to GC. We found that it was difficult to raise the reaction temperature above 70 °C because an azeotropic point exists under the reaction conditions used. 3.2.3 Recycling of catalysts Figure 5 presents the performance of recycled catalyst (Mg/Al = 2) for the transesterification reaction between glycerol and DMC at 70 °C. It was found that the conversion of glycerol in the first three recycles remained 66% above, and decreased slightly to 63.1% in the 6th recycle. This decrease might be caused by the loss of catalysts during these experiments because only 0.39 g solid catalyst remained after the sixth recycle. The XRD patterns of the as-synthesized, calcined, and 6-recycled Mg-Al LDHs (Mg/Al = 2) are compared in Fig. 6 . The well-known diffraction peaks in the calcined sample are not well-defined because of the loss of water, carbonate, and hydroxide. We found that the expected diffraction peaks of the LDHs appeared in the 6 times recycled sample, and this phenomenon is attributed to the special memory effect of LDH materials [37–39]. 4 Conclusions Mg-Al LDHs (Mg/Al = 0.5–6) could be synthesized by a conventional coprecipitation method. It was confirmed that the crystallinity and uniformity of solid lamellas of LDHs with Mg/Al = 2 are the best. Calcined Mg-Al LDHs (Mg/Al = 2) exhibited high catalytic performance and stability in the transesterification reaction between glycerol and DMC at 70 °C, and the conversion of glycerol reached 66.9%.
