RomS.n-Martfnez, D. Cazorla-Amor6s, A. Linares-Solano*, C. Salinas-Martfnez de Lecea Departamento de Qu(mica Inorgdnica, Universidad de Alicante Apdo, 99 Alicante, Spain Received 15 February 1994; revised 4 May 1994; accepted 4 May 1994 Abstract The hydrogenation of carbon dioxide by hydrogen over alkaline earths and platinum-based catalysts supported on carbon has been studied by temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) experiments at 0.1 MPa. Calcium- and magnesium-based catalysts and platinum samples with different metal dis- persion have been analyzed. Mass balances of the possible reactions that may take place have been calculated to interpret the TPR patterns. The results obtained show that: (i) carbon dioxide uptake is an important step for its further reduction and calcium is more active than magnesium due to its easier carbonation; (ii) the higher the platinum dispersion is, the higher is the catalytic activity and (iii) a catalyst containing both calcium and platinum exhibits the best activity. All the catalysts studied have a high selectivity to carbon monoxide formation. A mechanism in which separate catalytic sites are envisaged for carbon dioxide activation and hydrogen dissociation explains the results obtained. Keywords: Alkaline earth; Carbon dioxide hydrogenation; Platinum 1. Introduction Carbon dioxide accumulation in the atmosphere from anthropogenic sources, mainly from the combustion of fossil fuels, is the major reason of global warming. The fact that the consequences of carbon dioxide accumulation could be negative have led researchers to investigate different ways for reducing the carbon dioxide emission and to improve the use of this wasted compound [ 1-3 ]. All the carbon dioxide uses are based upon the fact that it is a cheap and abundant carbon source. *Corresponding author. 0926-860X/94/$07.00 1994 Elsevier Science B.V.

Rom6n-Martlnez et aL /Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 187-204 The two major possible uses proposed are synthesis of organic compounds con- taining carboxyl groups and reduction processes to obtain other valuable molecules (CO, CH3OH, CH4, etc.) [4]. This last process has recently received some attention in order to develop the most adequate catalyst. In this sense, the catalytic effect of different metals towards the CO2-H2 reaction [ 5-19 ] and the nature of the carbon dioxide interaction with the catalyst [20-22] have been analyzed in some detail. The fitness of the suitable catalysts seems to be due to both their ability to dissociate hydrogen and to activate carbon dioxide via molecular chemisorption, dissociation or the formation of car- bonate like species [5-8,16,20]. Consequently, it is reasonable to think that the combination of two chemical species with specific characteristics towards the above commented functions can result in suitable catalysts for carbon dioxide hydrogen- ation. Alkaline earth metal oxides (MO) are of special interest for carbon dioxide activation. The carbonate formation supposes a weakening of the C-O bonds with respect to the carbon dioxide molecule [23] and, as has recently been shown in a study about the CaO-CO2 interaction [24], the carbon dioxide chemisorption already occurs at room temperature by a fast process. Furthermore, Relier et al. [25 ] have studied the decomposition of natural metal carbonates under hydrogen atmosphere. The results showed that the decomposition temperature is shifted to lower values and carbon monoxide is the predominant gas product in the case of CaO. In addition, ifa transition metal is mixed, then an important amount of methane is formed. Based upon this study, the authors propose the alkaline earth metal oxides obtained by decomposition of alkaline earth metal carbonates as potential catalysts for carbon dioxide hydrogenation and as effective carbon dioxide trapping systems. Taking into account all the above results and our knowledge about the MO-CO2 and MO-carbon systems [24,26-32], the catalysis of the CO2-H2 reaction by MO- based catalysts supported on carbon is studied in this paper. In this sense, the activity of magnesium oxide and of calcium oxide dispersed on carbon and the effect of the presence of platinum (very active for hydrogen dissociation) is dis- cussed. It is known [5-8] that platinum is the least active catalyst for carbon dioxide hydrogenation among several transition metals. However, it is one of the most active catalysts to dissociate hydrogen. For this reason it is expected that the combination of MO (active to activate carbon dioxide) and platinum (active to dissociate hydrogen) results in an effective system to hydrogenate carbon dioxide. Moreover, the catalytic activity of carbon-supported platinum catalysts with dif- ferent dispersion degree is analyzed. 2. Experimental 2.1. Supports Three different supports were prepared according to the following procedure: Support A was prepared by carbonization of a phenolformaldehyde polymer resin M. C. Rom6n-Martfnez et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 187-204 in nitrogen at 5 K/min to 1273 K with 2 h soak time. This is a high purity char with high surface area (BET surface about 600 m2/g) and well developed porosity [ 27 ]. Support A2 was obtained from support A by oxidation with 15 M HNO3 at 353 K to dryness. The oxidizing treatment produces an increase of about 150 m2/ g in the B.E.T. surface area of the support. The selective removal of surface complexes from A2 resulted in support A4. This support was obtained by heating sample A2 up to 800 K in nitrogen to remove the less stable oxygen complexes, mainly carboxylic groups, that decompose as carbon dioxide. This heat treatment produces a support with a B.E.T. surface area of about 850 m2/g. 2.2. Catalysts Mg/A2 and Ca/A2 catalysts were prepared by loading Mg 2+ and Ca 2 + ions by ion exchange from the corresponding alkaline earth metal acetate solution ( 1.5 M). The procedure used is described elsewhere [ 27 ]. Support A2 was used to prepare these catalysts because in this carbon sample the largest amount of Ca 2 + and Mg z+ ions are ion exchanged [ 27 ]. The magnesium and calcium contents of these samples are 2.4 and 2.6 wt.-%, respectively. Regardless of the state of the alkaline earth species on the support (i.e., ion exchanged or as an oxide) the catalysts are named with the symbol of the corre- sponding element. Pt/carbon catalysts were prepared by impregnation with an aqueous solution of tetraaminplatinum chloride, [Pt(NH3)4]CI2, in the appropriate concentration to obtain platinum loadings of about 1%. The impregnation was done with excess solution ( 10 ml of solution per 1 g of carbon), and nitrogen was flowed through the suspension until the liquid had evaporated. Afterwards, catalysts were dried at 383 K ovemight and kept in a desiccator until use. Pt-Ca/carbon and Pt-Mg/ carbon catalysts were prepared by subsequent impregnation of the M/carbon sam- ples (M=Ca and Mg) with the platinum precursor solution in the same way as detailed above. The platinum content was measured by buming off the carbon in air at 973 K. The residue was dissolved in aqua regia and analyzed by UV spectro- photometry (261.8 nm) The platinum loading of the catalysts are included in Table 1. Platinum dispersion was measured by hydrogen chemisorption according to the following procedure: (i) heat treatment in helium at 673 K, 2 h with a flow-rate of 60 ml/min (298 K, 0.1 MPa) to avoid the formation of the mobile platinum hydride [Pt(NH3)2] H2 and particle agglomeration that would result if the heat treatment was carried out in hydrogen [33,34] ; (ii) further heating in hydrogen at 623 K, 12 h, 60 ml/min (298 K, 0.1 MPa) to achieve complete platinum reduction; (iii) outgassing for 1 h at 573 K in vacuum and cooling to 298 K; (iv) hydrogen chemisorption. The adsorption isotherms were linear in the range of pressures used (50-250 Torr, 1 Torr= 133.3 Pa) and the monolayer of hydrogen chemisorbed M.C.

Table 1 contains the platinum dispersion so measured. 2.3. Temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) experiments Catalytic activity studies of the different samples have been performed by TPR experiments. The apparatus used to carry out the temperature-programmed exper- iments is a dynamic micro-reactor, running at atmospheric pressure, coupled to a VG Quadrupoles mass spectrometer. The equipment includes a system of valves that allows the gas sent to the reactor to be changed rapidly (within a few seconds) without any effect on the total flow. At the outlet of the reactor, a portion of the gas is sent to the mass spectrometer through a classical introduction system consisting of a capillary tube, a mechanical vacuum pump and porous leak. Prior to TPR experiments, the platinum-containing catalysts were pretreated in situ in helium at 673 K for 2 h with a flow-rate of 60 ml/min (298 K, 0.1 MPa) and in hydrogen at 623 K for 12 h with a flow-rate of 60 ml/min (298 K, 0.1 MPa). The M/carbon catalysts were pretreated in helium to 673 K (similar to Pt-based catalysts) or to 1250 K in order to clean the carbon surface. After that, the samples were cooled down to room temperature in hydrogen (or in helium for the M/carbon catalysts) and then hydrogen (or helium) was switched to a He/H2/CO2 gas mixture (87% He, 10% H2, 3 % CO2), in all cases at a flow-rate of 60 ml/min (298 K, 0.1 MPa). When the gas levels were stabilized, the samples were heated at 20 K/min up to 1250 K. To check the effect of the carbon dioxide and hydrogen partial pressures on the catalytic activity, some additional TPR experiments were carded out with the Pt-Ca/A2 sample using a reactive gas mixture consisting of H2/CO2 (75%, 25%), also with a flow-rate of 60 ml/min (298 K, 0.1 MPa). In this case a gas chromatograph was used as detection and analysis system. The amount of sample used in all the experiments was about 200 mg, except for sample Mg/A2 where 100 mg were used (Fig. 1 ). The TPR patterns obtained show the evolution in the levels of H2, CO2, CO, H20 and CH 4. The quantities of CO2 + CO (b 1 ) and CO2 + 1/2 CO (b2) that represent M.C.

Here it must be pointed out that the determination of water in these experiments involves some problems due to the difficulty of avoiding condensation and the important background of the m/e = 18 in the mass spectrometer. For this reason there is some uncertainty about the temperature at which water is evolved (in the TPR experiments it can appear with a delay) and an accurate quantification is difficult. In consequence, the water evolution profile has not been used to calculate a balance of hydrogen. However, water evolution is presented in the TPR spectra because the shape of its profile gives information about the relationship between the water formation and the changes in the levels of the other gases (i.e. type of reaction occurring). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. TPR study of supports The TPR experiments carried out with the supports show that there is a noticeable interaction between hydrogen and the support, depending on the surface chemistry of the supports. It is also observed that the gasification reaction starts above 1073 192 M.C.

It must be pointed out that no reaction between hydrogen and carbon dioxide occurred during the TPR experiment. The features related to the hydrogen con- sumption have been observed and interpreted before in a temperature-programmed reduction (with hydrogen) study of these supports [35]. The interaction of hydrogen with the support proceeds by occupation of the active sites left after the decomposition of surface oxygen complexes or by reduction of these surface com- plexes [ 35 ]. These experiments give information about the contribution of the support to the TPR experiment with catalysts, but it is important to stress that they cannot be used to subtract this contribution from the TPR experiment. The presence of a catalyst (Ca, Mg and/or Pt) can significantly change the extent and type of the interaction between hydrogen and the support. A previous study discusses these aspects in detail [ 35 ]. 3.2. M/carbon catalysts Figs. 1 and 2 present the evolution of gases during the TPR experiments carried out with the Mg/A2 and Ca/A2 catalysts. These TPR patterns show that the most important carbon containing product of the reaction is carbon monoxide. It can be observed that, for the two catalysts, the carbon monoxide desorption starts at a much higher temperature (about 750 K) than that typical for the carbon dioxide hydrogenation reaction (between 400-673 K) [ 5-19]. This indicates that neither M.C.

TPR spectrum of sample Mg/A2 after heat treatment in helium at 1250 K (bl =CO2+CO; b2=CO2 + 1/2CO). Mg/A2 nor Ca/A2 are adequate catalysts for this reaction. The large amount of surface oxygen complexes present on support A2 (a highly oxidized carbon) [ 28 ], introduces additional complexity to the TPR experiments. Its presence does not allow us to establish differences between catalytic activity of Mg/A2 and Ca/A2 samples. In fact, the evolution of the surface oxygen groups in the experiments shown in Figs. 1 and 2 introduces an important unbalance in the carbon dioxide level (see that bl and b2 start to deviate at about 700 K in both cases). Moreover, the carbon monoxide molecules from whatever of the two carbon dioxide reactions (gasification or hydrogenation) cannot be discriminated from those produced from surface oxygen groups decomposition. These observations make it impossible to discriminate the relative importance of the two carbon dioxide reactions. Hence, due to the difficulty that poses the presence of oxygen complexes for the TPR interpretation, additional experiments have been carried out after a heat treatment in helium to 1250 K. This heat treatment eliminates most of the oxygen groups and permits a better interpretation and comparison of the TPR results of the Ca/A2 and Mg/A2 samples. Figs. 3 and 4 present the TPR patterns obtained with the high temperature heat treated Mg/A2 and Ca/A2 samples. Once the oxygen complexes have been removed, the main processes that occur are carbon gasification and carbon dioxide hydrogenation. The spectra obtained show that the most important carbon contain- ing product is carbon monoxide; besides carbon monoxide, a small amount of methane is formed. For the two catalysts, the carbon monoxide production (that 194 M.C.

The carbon monoxide formation occurs at a lower temperature for sample Ca/A2 and the carbon dioxide consumption is higher for this sample, indicating a higher catalytic activity for any of the two reactions that can take place (i.e., carbon gasification or carbon dioxide hydrogenation). It must be noted that the alkaline earth metals are good catalysts for the CO2--carbon gasification reaction [ 30,36,37 ] ; calcium being the best of this group [ 30,37 ]. Therefore, the carbon gasification reaction must be considered to explain the TPR spectra, mainly at high temperature (above 700 K). Actually, in the case of calcium, Fig. 4 shows that the temperature at which the carbon monoxide production starts (ca. 800 K) is similar to that observed in the carbon monoxide production from the CO2-carbon reaction [ 32]. The contribution of both reactions (carbon gasification and carbon dioxide hydrogenation) is clearly observed when the carbon dioxide balances [i.e., CO2 + CO (bl) and CO2 + 1/2 CO (b2)] are calculated. In both cases, none of the two balances can fully explain the TPR experiments; in general, the CO2 + CO one overestimates the balance while the contrary happens with the CO2 + l/2 CO one. This indicates that both reactions take place to an important extent and thus, the best should be consider a combination of both balances. When the two samples are compared, it is observed that the bl balance is kept longer for sample Mg/A2 than for Ca/A2, what suggests that magnesium has a larger selectivity to carbon dioxide hydrogenation than calcium.

Percentage of carbonation of CaO and MgO samples during a heat treatment in carbon dioxide. In the case of the Ca/A2 sample, the two balances presented in Fig. 4 display similar features than those previously observed in the TPR study of the CaO-CO2 reaction and the CO2-carbongasification catalyzed by calcium [24,32]. There is a carbon dioxide consumption between 400 and 750 K due to CaO carbonation and a maximum at about 1080 K attributed to CaCO3 decomposition [24,32]. In the case of Mg/A2 catalyst, the carbon dioxide balances (Fig. 3) do not show the characteristics observed for the Ca/A2 sample. Neither the MgO carbonation nor the subsequent decomposition appears. It is a striking observation that under these conditions, the process (i.e., carbonate formation and decomposition) is not favou- red in the case of MgO. This last point has been studied by thermogravimetry (TG) experiments. Fig. 5 presents the evolution of the percentage of carbonation with temperature when bulk CaO and MgO (obtained from the corresponding acetates) are heated in a carbon dioxide atmosphere. It is clear that the reaction of CaO with carbon dioxide starts at quite low temperatures (from 350 K) and that the complete carbonation is reached at about 1100 K. However, in the temperature range studied, MgO is not carbonated. The different reactivity of these two alkaline earth metal oxides, due to the different covalent contribution of the lattice bond, can explain this behaviour. Thus, the covalent contribution to the chemical bond of the MgO lattice is larger than in the case of CaO; the melting point of MgO is about 200 K higher than that of CaO (2826 K and 2613 K, respectively) [38] and hence, the stability of the MgO lattice is larger than that of CaO. In this way, taking in mind the purpose of this work, CaO is much more suitable than MgO as carbon dioxide hydrogenation catalyst because it has higher affinity to trap and activate the carbon dioxide molecule. 196 M.C.

TPR spectrum of sample Pt/A (bl = CO2 + CO; b2 = CO2 + 1/2CO). Of course, trapping and activation of the carbon dioxide molecule is one of the required characteristics of the catalyst, but it is not the only feature that the catalyst must fulfil. Dissociation of hydrogen molecules is also necessary to allow hydro- genation of carbon dioxide. As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, the catalytic activity of Mg/ A2 and Ca/A2 can be explained considering that they activate the carbon dioxide molecule by formation of the CO32- anion in which the C-O bonds are weaker than in the carbon dioxide molecule [23]. In this sense, the lower activity of magnesium with respect to calcium is due to the scarce MgO carbonation. On the other hand, the low activity of both calcium and magnesium can be related to the fact that they do not interact effectively with the hydrogen molecule. It must be noted that due to the stability of the MgO and CaO [ 38 ] species, their reaction with hydrogen only occurs at very high temperature. In this first part of the paper, the activity of catalysts that can activate the carbon dioxide molecule but that do not interact with hydrogen has been analyzed. In the following, the behaviour of platinum in this system is studied. Platinum is a catalyst that is very active towards hydrogen dissociation but with a low activity to dissociate carbon dioxide [ 20-22]. 3.3. Pt/carbon catalysts.

The differences observed in platinum dispersion are related to the different surface chemistry and porous texture of supports [39]. At first glance, the TPR patterns show that there is an effect of platinum dispersion on carbon dioxide consumption. It is clear from Figs. 6 to 8 that the larger the dispersion is, the larger is the catalytic activity, that is, with catalyst Pt/A the carbon dioxide hydrogenation starts at temperatures of about 570 K, whereas for the less dispersed sample, Pt/ A2, it starts at about 800 K. When the three TPR experiments are compared, some differences arise related not only to the platinum dispersion, but also to the different surface oxidation degree of the supports. In this way, the interpretation of the TPR experiments becomes more complex when a large amount of surface oxygen groups is present (samples Pt/A4 and Pt/A2). The sample Pt/A was prepared with support A that, due to its preparation procedure, contains few oxygen groups. For this reason only the carbon dioxide hydrogenation and the CO2-carbon gasification reactions must be considered to explain the TPR profile. The CO2 + CO balance (bl) is fulfilled up to temperatures of about 900 K. Up to this temperature, the carbon dioxide and hydrogen con- sumptions and the carbon monoxide production are similar. From 900 K, the COz + CO balance deviates over the carbon dioxide level, indicating that a new reaction that produces a larger amount of carbon monoxide is happening (i.e., carbon gasification). This is clearly observed by the change in the slope of the carbon monoxide curve evolution at about 920 K. In the case of catalyst Pt/A4, the carbon support was obtained after heat treatment of support A2 to 800 K. As a consequence of this heat treatment most of the carboxylic groups decompose but also, as shown in a previous study [ 35 ], there is a partial transformation of some oxygen surface groups to form stable anhydride groups. When this support was studied by TPR with hydrogen [35] it was found that the decomposition of this new type of anhydride groups produces a carbon dioxide molecule and a reactive C(O) complex that can be reduced by hydrogen. According with the above comments, the TPR experiment of Fig. 7 should be analyzed considering not only the contribution of carbon gasification and carbon dioxide hydrogenation, but also the evolution and reduction of oxygen complexes. The TPR experiment of this sample shows that the carbon dioxide consumption starts at about 680 K (more than 100 K higher than the sample Pt/A) and the CO2 + CO balance (bl) is kept to temperatures of about 800 K. The change in the carbon monoxide curve at around 1000 K (similar to that observed in sample Pt/ A at ca. 920 K) indicates the increasing importance of the carbon gasification reaction from this temperature onwards. A shoulder is observed in the CO2 + CO balance at about 950 K together with a decrease in the rate of carbon dioxide consumption. Both phenomena are related to the desorption of surface oxygen complexes. The decrease in the hydrogen level starts at a similar temperature than the carbon dioxide level does; however, from 850 K the hydrogen consumption is clearly higher than that of the carbon dioxide, showing that hydrogen is reacting M. C. Rom6n-Martfnez et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 187-204 with both the carbon dioxide molecules and the support (reduction of oxygen complexes and reaction with carbon active sites left by the desorbing oxygen complexes [35] ). Finally, the sample Pt/A2 (Fig. 8) exhibits a very low catalytic activity towards carbon dioxide hydrogenation. The carbon monoxide production (either from car- bon gasification, carbon dioxide reduction or decomposition of surface oxygen complexes) occurs at about 800 K. As observed in sample Pt/A4, a shoulder appears at 930 K in the CO2 + CO balance (bl) related to desorption of surface oxygen groups. Besides, the hydrogen consumption over practically the whole temperature range is larger than the carbon dioxide consumption and the carbon monoxide production, indicating that a large part of the hydrogen reacts with the support (i.e., reduction of surface oxygen complexes and interaction with carbon active sites). As a summary, these results show that platinum activity for the carbon dioxide hydrogenation reaction increases with dispersion. The best results are obtained using the sample Pt/A, with a platinum dispersion of 70%. The catalytic activity found for platinum catalysts is larger than that found for the alkaline earth oxides catalysts. It seems that the dissociation of hydrogen is the most important step in carbon dioxide reduction. However, the possible effect of platinum to activate carbon dioxide by means of a Pt-H species can not be discarded. In the next part of the paper the effect of the combination of both elements (platinum and an alkaline earth) in the carbon dioxide hydrogenation reaction is analyzed. This combination results in a new catalyst in which one species can activate the carbon dioxide molecule (alkaline earth metal) and the other one can effectively dissociate hydrogen (platinum). 3.4. Pt-M/carbon catalysts Before the analysis of the resulting TPR spectra of Pt-M/A2 samples, it must be noted that the platinum dispersion of these catalysts is similar to that of the less dispersed Pt/carbon sample (about 25%). This aspect must be considered when comparing the results of the different platinum-based catalysts. Figs. 9 and 10 show the TPR patterns obtained for samples Pt-Mg/A2 and Pt- Ca/A2. As happens with the M/A2 catalysts (Figs. 1-4), the calcium-based cat- alyst is more active than the magnesium one. So, the carbon monoxide production starts at ca. 530 K in Pt--Ca/A2 and at ca. 600 K in Pt-Mg/A2; and the formation of methane occurs in the former catalyst at a lower temperature. Moreover, in the Pt-Ca/A2 sample, the COz + CO balance is fulfilled up to temperatures of about 800 K while in the Pt-Mg/A2 some deviation appears at around 725 K. These deviations observed can be produced either from desorption of surface oxygen complexes or from carbon gasification. The large carbon monoxide evolution at high temperature, mainly due to carbon gasification, is also clearly observed. The excess of hydrogen consumption, in respect to the carbon monoxide evolution M.C.

(reaction product), observed at temperatures higher than 700 K indicates that part of the hydrogen is reacting with the carbon surface (by reduction of surface oxygen complexes and interaction with active sites of carbon). It is a striking point that in both cases, peaks related to the carbonate decompo- sition are observed (at 900 K and 1000 K for Pt-Mg/A2 and Pt-Ca/A2, respec- tively). When the catalysts Mg/A2 and Ca/A2 were analyzed (Figs. 1 and 2), the TPR spectra obtained clearly showed CaCO3 decomposition features, while this was not the case for magnesium. However, when platinum is present the carbonate decomposition pattern is observed in both cases. This result suggests that either there is an effective Pt-M interaction (at least with magnesium), as a consequence of which the reactivity of the alkaline earth oxides is increased, or that the highly reactive hydrogen produced by the platinum changes the surface characteristics of the alkaline earth oxides and therefore its reactivity. In the following, a comparative analysis of all the samples studied in this paper is presented for a better understanding of the results obtained. Compared with the M/A2 catalysts, it seems clear that the presence of platinum improves the catalytic activity to a significant extent. The temperature at which carbon dioxide consump- tion (or carbon monoxide production) starts is at least 170 K lower (compare Figs. 1-4 with Figs. 9 and 10). On the other hand, with respect to the Pt/A2 catalyst (sample with similar platinum dispersion than the Pt-M/A2 catalysts) (Fig. 8) the presence of calcium shifts the carbon monoxide production rate to a temperature 200 K lower. Moreover, the Pt-Ca/A2 catalyst still shows a better behaviour than the Pt-based catalysts with higher dispersion (samples Pt/A and Pt/A4) (Figs. 6 and 7). Table 2 presents the kinetic data, deduced from the TPR experiments, for the carbon dioxide hydrogenation on the different catalysts. The results obtained for catalyst Pt-Ca/A2 from experiments using a higher carbon dioxide partial pressure are also included. The turnover frequency for methane formation is not presented because methane is evolved at quite high temperatures and the amount formed is M.C. Romrn-Martfnez et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 187-204 very low. This experiment will allow us to compare the activity of the best catalyst studied with those obtained by other authors under similar conditions. The apparent activation energy has been calculated from the initial part of the carbon monoxide desorption profile in the TPR experiments. Except for Pt-Mg/ A2, the values obtained are similar for the different catalysts. The magnitude of the activation energy is close to those previously obtained for the carbon monoxide production process from carbon dioxide hydrogenation [ 5-8,12,18 ]. This suggests that, in the region in which Ea has been calculated, the main reaction taking place is the carbon dioxide hydrogenation, in agreement with the fulfilment of the CO2 + CO balance. The carbon dioxide conversion and the reaction rate (/xmol CO produced/s//zmol Ptsu~face), measured from the TPR experiments carded out with a gas mixture containing a 3% CO2 and 10% H2, show the largest activity for the Pt-Ca/A2 catalyst. The reaction rate data included in Table 2 for carbon dioxide hydrogenation on the Pt-Ca/A2 catalyst using a higher carbon dioxide partial pressure (25%), have been compared with reaction rate measurements obtained by other authors at 0.1 MPa on Pd [5], Rh [8,10], Ru [6,7,11], Fe [14] and Co [18] based catalysts. The lowest activity is found for the Fe-based catalyst. For the rest of the catalysts, the reaction rate has a similar magnitude. The most important difference of catalyst Pt-Ca/A2 with respect to the Pd [5-8], Rh [ 10], Ru [ 11 ] and Co [ 18] catalysts is that the first one has a great selectivity towards carbon monoxide formation, while in the other catalysts the production of methane is more important. This difference can be explained if we compare the mechanism proposed for the carbon dioxide hydrogenation to produce methane [ 5-8 ] with the one that probably occurs when the Pt-Ca/A2 is used. The mechanism proposed [ 5-8] considers that the carbon dioxide hydrogenation occurs via the formation of chemisorbed carbon monoxide. At this point, the formation of methanol or methane depends on the extent of hydrogen-assisted dissociation of the chemisorbed carbon monoxide. If the catalyst produces an important dissociation of carbon monoxide then methane formation is favoured. However, in the Pt--Ca/A2 catalyst, the reaction mechanism occurs in a different way. In this case, the carbon dioxide molecule is not dissociated. It is chemisorbed on the CaO surface forming CO32- anions. Then, the CO32- anions react with atomic hydrogen, formed by the platinum, yielding carbon monoxide. Because this carbon monoxide is not adsorbed on the CaO it immediately reaches the gas phase. This mechanism has some similarities with that proposed for methanol formation catalyzed by copper [ 16]. The main difference and maybe the reason for the different selectivity of both catalysts, is that the copper catalyst is partially reduced (an active site composed of Cu + and Cu species is necessary) and hence, after CO32- dissociation, formate species with a long life are formed and subsequently hydrogenated to produce methanol. In summary, the obtained results indicate that the combination of the two catalytic species, each one with a specific function, improves the activity of the resulting M. C. Rom6n-Martfnez et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 187-204 catalyst. In this way, the combination of CaO (with a high selectivity to carbon dioxide chemisorption) and platinum (with a high selectivity to the dissociative chemisorption of hydrogen) results in a catalyst with a high activity for the carbon dioxide hydrogenation and with a high selectivity to carbon monoxide formation. The fact that CaO cannot be in a partially reduced state, as happens with copper, can be the reason of this selectivity. A further study will be carried out in order to analyze this point. In this sense, experiments under high-pressure conditions will be performed and other metals instead of platinum will be analyzed. 4. Conclusions The results of this study show that calcium- or magnesium-based catalysts have a poor activity to carbon dioxide hydrogenation. Platinum-based catalysts need to have a high dispersion to achieve a noticeable activity. A combination of the alkaline earth with the platinum gives an adequate catalyst for carbon dioxide hydrogenation, of which the combination of calcium and platinum is very interesting. In the platinum and calcium containing catalyst, the two specific functions necessary for the reaction to be effectively catalyzed are provided by calcium and platinum. Calcium favours carbon dioxide trapping and activation by forming carbonate anions and platinum dissociates effectively the hydrogen molecule. The high activ- ity and selectivity of this catalyst to carbon monoxide formation is explained considering the above commented separation of the active sites for carbon dioxide and hydrogen interaction. Due to the lack of interaction between carbon monoxide and CaO, once carbon dioxide is reduced by atomic hydrogen the carbon monoxide formed readily reaches the gas phase avoiding further hydrogenation.

The hydrogenation of carbon dioxide by hydrogen over alkaline earths and platinum-based catalysts supported on carbon has been studied by temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) experiments at 0.1 MPa. Calcium- and magnesium-based catalysts and platinum samples with different metal dispersion have been analyzed. Mass balances of the possible reactions that may take place have been calculated to interpret the TPR patterns. The results obtained show that: (i) carbon dioxide uptake is an important step for its further reduction and calcium is more active than magnesium due to its easier carbonation; (ii) the higher the platinum dispersion is, the higher is the catalytic activity and (iii) a catalyst containing both calcium and platinum exhibits the best activity. All the catalysts studied have a high selectivity to carbon monoxide formation. A mechanism in which separate catalytic sites are envisaged for carbon dioxide activation and hydrogen dissociation explains the results obtained.

Mass balances of the possible reactions that may take place have been calculated to interpret the TPR patterns. The results obtained show that: (i) carbon dioxide uptake is an important step for its further reduction and calcium is more active than magnesium due to its easier carbonation; (ii) the higher the platinum dispersion is, the higher is the catalytic activity and (iii) a catalyst containing both calcium and platinum exhibits the best activity. All the catalysts studied have a high selectivity to carbon monoxide formation. A mechanism in which separate catalytic sites are envisaged for carbon dioxide activation and hydrogen dissociation explains the results obtained.",
