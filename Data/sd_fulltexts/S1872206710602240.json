DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(10)60224-0 Preparation of Highly Loaded and Active Ni/Al 2 O 3 Catalysts for the Hydrogenation of Aromatic Rings HU Shenghua, XUE Mingwei, CHEN Hui, SUN Yinlu, SHEN Jianyi * Laboratory of Mesoscopic Chemistry, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, China Abstract: Highly loaded and dispersed Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B catalysts were prepared by the co-precipitation method with an n-butanol drying process. The loading of nickel and drying process were found to be the two key factors in determining the surface area and pore structures of catalysts as well as the reducibility and dispersion of supported nickel. The 80%Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B treated with n-butanol during the drying process exhibited the high surface area and high reducibility and dispersion of supported nickel, leading to the high active nickel surface area (90 m 2 /g-catalyst). It adsorbed toluene strongly and thus exhibited high activity for the hydrogenation of aromatic rings in toluene and phenol. Key words: Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst; drying with n-butanol; active metal surface area; microcalorimetric adsorption; hydrogenation of toluene; hydrogenation of phenol Since J-Al 2 O 3 exhibits the high surface area and thermal stability while nickel is of low cost and highly active for hy- drogenation reactions, Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts have been widely used in a variety of catalytic processes in fine chemical syn- thesis and petrochemical industries [1â€“14]. The hydrogenation of aromatics is important in the refineries for reducing the content of aromatics in diesel and gasoline fuels. Thus, the hydrogenation of benzene or toluene, as a model reaction, on the Ni/Al 2 O 3 , Ni/SiO 2 -TiO 2 , Ni/ZSM-5, and Ni/MCM-41 has been investigated [7,10,15â€“17]. In addition, the hydrogena- tions of benzene and toluene are frequently used as probe reactions to characterize metal catalysts since they are taken as the insensitive reactions with respect to the surface struc- tures of metals [18â€“20]. Due to the low cost and high activity of nickel, the hydrogenation of phenol over supported nickel catalysts was studied as an alternative way to replace the thermal or catalytic incinerations for the treatment of wastes containing phenols [21,22]. Different factors have been investigated in order to prepare the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts with high activities. The factors studied include the precursor [7,12], loading [5,6,7,10,14,23], prepa- ration method [10,24], pretreatment (drying and calcination) [7,13,14,25,26], and reduction condition (temperature, heating rate, hydrogen flow and reduction time) [7,13]. The reducibil- ity and dispersion of the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts are significantly affected by these factors. The reducibility and dispersion are usually two contradictory factors that are difficult to improve simultaneously. They must be carefully balanced in order to optimize the active surface areas of nickel in the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts. Loading of nickel is an important factor since it affects the number of surface active nickel sites and acidity of the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts, which in turn affect the hydrogenation activity of the catalysts. Supported nickel catalysts with high loadings beyond 50% are usually used for industrial hydro- genation processes [27,28]. However, the catalysts with load- ing of nickel less than 20% were reported in the majority lit- erature. With the increase of loading of nickel (especially beyond 15%), the interaction between NiO and Al 2 O 3 usually becomes weaker, leading to the improved reducibility but decreased dispersion of nickel in Ni/Al 2 O 3 [14,23]. It was found that the reducibility of nickel was increased while the dispersion of nickel was hardly affected with the increase of nickel loading for the 10%â€“50%Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts. Accord- HU Shenghua et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 917â€“925 ingly, the activity for the hydrogenation of aniline and acetone on the catalysts was increased owing to the increased surface active nickel sites. In addition, the product selectivity was varied, probably due to the change of surface acidity with loading [5,6]. The techniques used to prepare the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts in- clude impregnation [4,7,10â€“14,23,24,26], sol-gel [1â€“3,10], and co-precipitation [5,6,10,11,23â€“25]. The supported nickel catalysts with high dispersion and loading of nickel are more easily obtained by the co-precipitation and sol-gel methods than by the conventional impregnation method. The co-precipitation is simple and economical, as compared to the sol-gel method. In order to obtain superfine or high surface area materials, the precipitate and gel could be dried by using a variety of methods, which were systematically reviewed by Wang et al. [29]. Among these methods, solvent replacement drying (usually an organic solvent with low surface tension) has the advantages of simplicity and low cost. It has been reported that the pore shrinkage and the agglomeration of particles could be reduced to a large extent for the preparation of ZrO 2 /Al 2 O 3 [30], TiO 2 [31], and Ni/MgO [32] from gel or precipitation treated with n-butanol. In this work, a series of highly loaded Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts were prepared by the co-precipitation method with an n-butanol drying process. It was found that the treatment with n-butanol significantly improved the active surface area of nickel and thus activity of the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts for the hy- drogenation reactions. 1 Experimental 1.1 Preparation of catalysts The 60%â€“90% Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts (weight percent) were prepared by the co-precipitation method. Specifically, desired amount of metal nitrates (Ni(NO 3 ) 2 Â·6H 2 O and Al(NO 3 ) 3 Â·9H 2 O, both in AR grade) were dissolved in 100 ml distilled water to form a solution (I). Desired amount of Na 2 CO 3 (AR) was dis- solved in 100 ml distilled water to form another solution (II). The two solutions were simultaneously dropwise added into a beaker containing 250 ml distilled water at 353 K under vig- orous stirring. The precipitate formed was filtered and washed thoroughly with distilled water until pH of the filtrate was 7. N-butanol (about 200 ml, AR) was then added into the pre- cipitate and heated at 353 K overnight during which water and n-butanol were evaporated. The precipitate was then dried in an oven at 393 K for 12 h. The catalysts were denoted as 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B and 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 with and without the treatment with n-butanol, respectively, in which 60 stands for the weight percentage of nickel. 1.2 Characterization of catalysts The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were deter- mined at 77 K using a Micromeritics Gemini V 2380 auto- sorption analyzer. All the catalysts were out-gassed in flowing nitrogen at 673 K for 3 h prior to the measurements. The spe- cific surface areas were calculated using the Brun- auer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, and the pore size distribu- tions were obtained according to the desorption branches by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Philips Xâ€™Pert Pro diffractometer using Ni-filtered Cu K D radiation (O = 0.15418 nm), operated at 40 kV and 40 mA at a scanning rate of 25 o /min. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measurements were performed by using a quartz U-tube reactor loaded with about 50 mg of a sample calcined at 573 K in 5.03% H 2 /N 2 (v/v) at a flow rate of 40 ml/min. The hydrogen consumption was monitored by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The reducing gas was first passed through the reference arm of the TCD before entering the reactor. The exiting gas passed through a trap filled with soda lime to remove water and pos- sibly CO 2 and then reached the second arm of the TCD. The temperature was linearly raised from 303 to 1173 K with a rate of 10 K/min. Microcalorimetric adsorption measurements were per- formed using a Tian-Calvet type C-80 microcalorimeter (Se- taram, France), which was connected to a glass vacuum-dosing system, equipped with a Baratron capacitance manometer (USA) for the pressure measurement and gas handling. About 0.1 g of a catalyst was loaded, reduced for 2 h in flowing H 2 at 723 K, and then evacuated for 1 h prior to a measurement. Adsorption of toluene on 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B and 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B directly evacuated for 3 h were also determined in order to compare with that on the reduced ones. The adsorption of H 2 and O 2 was carried out in a home-made volumetric apparatus. The catalyst was reduced in H 2 at the desired temperature for 2 h and evacuated at the same tem- perature for 1 h before the measurements. The adsorption of H 2 was performed at room temperature. After the adsorption of H 2 , the sample was heated to 673 K at a rate of 10 K/min and evacuated at the temperature for 1 h. Then the adsorption of O 2 was performed at 673 K. The uptakes of H 2 and O 2 were ob- tained by extrapolating the coverage of corresponding iso- therms to P=0. The degree of reduction (reducibility), disper- sion, active surface area, and average particle size of supported nickel were calculated based on the amount of H 2 and O 2 ad- sorbed and the loading of nickel. The surface area of metallic nickel was calculated by the uptake of H 2 assuming the molar ratio of H/Ni surf =1 and a surface area of 6.5 Ã— 10 â€“20 m 2 for a Ni atom [33,34]. The amount of metallic nickel atoms in the catalyst were calculated according to the uptake of O 2 and the molar ratio of O/Ni=1 [35]. The reduction degree was then calculated by the number of nickel atoms titrated by O 2 ad- sorption divided by the number of nickel atoms present in the HU Shenghua et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 917â€“925 sample. Finally, the dispersion of nickel (D) could be calcu- lated according to the following equation: D (%) = uptake of H 2 /uptake of O 2 Ã— 100, while the average Ni particle size d (nm) could be derived from the equation (d (nm) = 101/D (%)) suggested by Smith et al. [36] assuming the spherical shape of metal particles. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were re- corded on a JEOL electron microscope (JEM-2100) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The reduced sample was put into ethanol and ultrasonically dispersed to make a suspension. A drop of the suspension was placed on a copper grid. 1.3 Catalytic hydrogenation The catalytic hydrogenation experiments were performed at atmospheric pressure in a continuous down-flow fixed-bed microreactor (a vertical glass tube with i.d. = 8 mm). 20-50 mg of a powered catalyst(80-100 mesh) was mixed with about 3 g quartz sand, and placed on the glass frit of the glass reac- tor. The catalyst was reduced in flowing H 2 at 723 K for 2 h prior to the hydrogenation. An n-hexane solution containing toluene (toluene:n-hexane = 1:2, w/w) or a cyclohexane solu- tion containing phenol (phenol:cyclohexane = 1:2, w/w) with H 2 was fed into the reactor for the hydrogenation reactions. The liquid feeds were delivered into the reactor using a 2ZB-1L10 dual-plunger infinitesimal quality metering pump. The reaction temperature was 423 K for hydrogenation of toluene and phenol. The weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of toluene changed from 28 to 106 h â€“1 while the WHSV of phenol varied from 70 to 411 h â€“1 . The WHSV was adjusted by changing the flow rates of liquids while keeping the H 2 /reactant ratios. The products were collected using a trap in ice bath. The products were analyzed by a gas chro- matograph (GC-122, Shanghai precision & scientific instru- ment Co., LTD) with an FID equipped with an HP-FFAP cap- illary column. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Textural and structural properties of catalysts The specific surface areas and pore structural parameters of the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts are summarized in Table 1. With the increase of loading of nickel from 60% to 90%, the surface areas decreased from 304 to 102 m 2 /g, while the pore volumes decreased from 1.17 to 0.29 cm 3 /g, for the Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B cata- lysts. The most probable pore diameters increased first, and then decreased with the increase of nickel loading, varying in the range of 5.7â€“14.3 nm for the Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B catalysts. Com- paring to the series of Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B catalysts, the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts with the same loadings of nickel without the n-butanol drying process exhibited significantly lower surface areas, pore sizes, and pore volumes. Thus, a treatment with n-butanol increased the surface areas and porosities of the catalysts, which were the two factors favoring the dispersion of supported nickel. N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distribu- tions for the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts reduced at 723 K are shown in Fig. 1. The isotherms (Fig. 1 (a)) for all the catalysts belonged to type IV with H3 hysteresis loops, typical of mesopores. The pore size distributions (Fig. 1 (b)) for all the catalysts exhib- ited only one peak with pore sizes ranging from 3 to 30 nm. The 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B exhibited the largest pores in the catalysts studied in this work with the most probable pore diameter of about 14.3 nm. The most probable pore diameters of 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 and 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 were much smaller than those of 0. 0.20.40.60.81.0 90Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B Q u a n t i t y a d s o r b e d Relative pressure (p/p 0 ) (a) 0 10203040 (b) 90Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B d V / d l o g ( D ) Pore diameter (nm) Fig. 1.

Figure 2 shows the XRD patterns of the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts reduced at 723 K. All the catalysts exhibited two broad and weak peaks around 37 o and 63 o , belonging to J-Al 2 O 3 [10]. No nickel aluminate spinel phases were detected, indicating the small crystallites of such phases in the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts. The XRD peaks characteristic of metallic nickel are around 44 o , 52 o , and 76 o , but these peaks were broad and weak in all the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts. The XRD peaks of nickel in the 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B, 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B, and 90Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B were gradu- ally intensified with increasing the content of nickel. It can be seen that the peak around 52 o in the 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B was weaker than in the 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 , indicating that n-butanol treatment enhanced the dispersion of nickel on J-Al 2 O 3 . 2.2 Reducibility and dispersion of supported nickel TPR measurements were performed in order to investigate the effects of loading and n-butanol treatment on the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts. Prior to the measurements, the catalysts were cal- cined at 573 K for 2 h. The results are shown in Fig. 3. All the catalysts displayed two reduction peaks. One with the reduc- tion temperature below 600 K was small, and might be as- cribed to the reduction of NiO not strongly interacted with Al 2 O 3 [17,37]. Another one was broad with the reduction temperatures in the range of 600â€“1040 K, and might be as- signed to the reduction of NiO highly dispersed in Al 2 O 3 . With the increase of nickel loading from 60% to 80%, the tempera- ture of the second reduction peak did not seem to change. The temperature was lowered only when the loading of nickel was increased to 90%. No difference was observed for the TPR profiles of Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B and Ni/Al 2 O 3 with the same loading of nickel. Thus, the treatment with n-butanol did not seem to affect the interaction between NiO and Al 2 O 3 in the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts. The active surface area of nickel, reducibility, dispersion and average particle size of reduced nickel in the catalysts could be calculated from the uptakes of H 2 and O 2 , as de- scribed in the experimental section. The data of H 2 and O 2 adsorption on the 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B reduced at different tempera- tures are given in Table 2. The H 2 and O 2 uptakes were 999 and 3736 È�mol/g, respectively, for the catalyst reduced at 673 K, corresponding to the reducibility and dispersion of about 66.8% and 26.7%, respectively. With the increase of reduction temperature from 673 to 773 K, the reducibility of nickel was increased while the dispersion of nickel was decreased for the catalyst. The product of loading, reducibility and dispersion of nickel determines the number of surface active nickel sites. It was found that the 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B reduced at 723 K exhibited the highest active nickel surface area (90 m 2 /g). Therefore, 723 K was selected as the reduction temperature for all the catalysts in the hydrogenations of toluene and phenol. The data of H 2 and O 2 adsorption for the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts reduced at 723 K are presented in Table 3. According to the H 2 and O 2 uptakes, the reducibility and dispersion were found to be 63.3% and 33.8% for the 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B, respectively, as compared to 67.9% and 22.9%, respectively, for the 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 .

As a result, the active surface area of nickel was significantly increased from 53 (for 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 ) to 73 m 2 /g (for 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B). When the loading of nickel was increased from 60% to 80%, the reducibility of nickel was increased from 63.3% to 82.0% while the dispersion of nickel was de- creased from 33.8% to 25.3% for the Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B catalysts. Although the dispersion of nickel was decreased for the 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B as compared to the 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B, the increase of loading of nickel and reducibility resulted in the signifi- cantly increased active surface area of nickel from 73 (for 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B) to 90 m 2 /g (for 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B). Further in- crease of loading of nickel to 90% decreased greatly the dis- persion of nickel (to 12%), leading to the greatly decreased active surface area of nickel (to 52 m 2 /g). As compared to the Ni/Al 2 O 3 with the same loadings of nickel, the Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B treated with n-butanol exhibited the significantly higher dis- persion of nickel and thus the significantly higher active sur- face areas of nickel since the reducibility of supported nickel was hardly affected by the n-butanol treatment. The data in Table 3 showed that the nickel particles were smaller in the Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B than in the corresponding Ni/Al 2 O 3 . The average sizes of nickel particles were calculated to be about 4.4 and 5.8 nm for the 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 and 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 , respectively, while they were found to be about 3.0 and 4.0 nm for the 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B and 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B, respectively. Representative TEM images and particle size distributions of 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 , 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B, and 90Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B are shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen that metallic nickel in the catalysts was uniformly dispersed in the form of aggregates of small crys- tallites on Al 2 O 3 , and the nickel particle sizes were affected by Table 3 Chemisorption of H 2 and O 2 on Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts reduced at 723 K Catalyst H 2 uptake (mmol/g cat. ) O 2 uptake (mmol/g cat. ) S Ni (m 2 /g cat. ) Reducibility (%) Dispersion (%) Diameter (nm) 60%Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B 938 2779 73 63.3 33.8 3.0 60%Ni/Al 2 O 3 683 2984 53 67.9 22.9 4.4 80%Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B 1160 4588 90 82.0 25.3 4.0 80%Ni/Al 2 O 3 765 4392 59 78.5 17.4 5.8 90%Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B 672 5531 52 90.7 12.1 8.3 3456 0 10 20 30 40 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B F r e q u e n c y ( % ) Particle size (nm) 45678 0 10 20 30 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 F r e q u e n c y ( % ) Particle size (nm) 789101 0 5 10 15 20 25 F r e q u e n c y ( % ) Particle size (nm) 90Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B Fig. 4.

HU Shenghua et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 917â€“925 nickel loading and drying process. According to the TEM images, the average sizes of nickel particles in the 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B and 90Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B were estimated to be about 4.4 and 8.7 nm, respectively. Thus, the nickel particle size decreased quickly with the increase of loading from 80% to 90%. On the other hand, the 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 possessed the larger average size of nickel particles (6.2 nm) than the 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B. Thus, the treatment with n-butanol favored the dispersion of nickel particles on Al 2 O 3 , agreeing with the re- sults of chemisorptions of H 2 and O 2 . 2.3 Microcalorimetric adsorption The results of microcalorimetric adsorption of NH 3 at 423 K on the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts reduced and evacuated at 723 K are shown in Fig. 5. The initial heat was measured to be about 138 kJ/mol for NH 3 adsorption on the 90Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B while those were found to be about 180 kJ/mol on the other cata- lysts. The heats of NH 3 adsorption on the 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B were higher than on the 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B except for the initial heat in the whole coverage. Thus, the surface acidities on the Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B decreased with the increase of loading of nickel. The Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B catalysts had slightly higher coverage of NH 3 than their Ni/Al 2 O 3 counterparts. However, the heats of NH 3 adsorption on the Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B were almost the same as on Ni/Al 2 O 3 at the same coverage of NH 3 . Thus, the treatment with n-butanol had little effect on the surface acidity of Ni/Al 2 O 3 . Figure 6 shows the results of microcalorimetric adsorption of toluene at 308 K on the Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B catalysts with and without the reduction at 723 K. The initial heats for the ad- sorption of toluene on the 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B and 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B evacuated directly at 723 K (without the reduction) were 116 and 80 kJ/mol, respectively. The initial heats were signifi- cantly higher (about 179 kJ/mol) on the 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B and 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B reduced at 723 K. However, the adsorption heats of toluene were decreased sharply to about 80 kJ/mol with the increase of toluene coverage. Thus, only small amount of toluene molecules were adsorbed on metallic nickel sites and most toluene molecules seemed to adsorb on acidic sites of the reduced Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts. Figure 7 shows the results of microcalorimetric adsorption of toluene at 308 K on the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts reduced and then evacuated at 723 K. The initial heats were about 179, 179, and 150 kJ/mol for the adsorption of toluene on the re- duced 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B, 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B and 90Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B, re- spectively, corresponding to the adsorption of toluene on me- tallic nickel atoms. The adsorption heats decreased sharply to lower than 80 kJ/mol with the increase of coverage of toluene, indicating the beginning of adsorption of toluene on acidic sites. Interestingly, the initial heats of toluene adsorption on metallic nickel seemed to be related to the surface acidity of the catalysts. High initial heat was generated when toluene was adsorbed on metallic nickel in the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts with 0 200 400 600 800 0 50 100 150 200 D i f f e r e n t i a l h e a t ( k J / m o l ) NH 3 coverage (Pmol/g) Â„ 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B Â… 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 z 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B { 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 S 90Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B Fig. 5.

HU Shenghua et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 917â€“925 higher surface acidity. Since the initial heat was lower than 120 kJ/mol for the adsorption of toluene on acidic sites, the higher heat generated by the adsorption of toluene on metallic nickel sites might be due to the effect of adjacent acidic sites. In fact, the acidic sites might attract electron charges from adjacent nickel atoms, leading to the electron-deficient nickel sites, which favored the donation of electron charges from the aromatic rings of toluene to the electron-deficient d orbitals of surface nickel atoms. Thus, the adsorption of toluene on me- tallic nickel could be enhanced by the presence of adjacent acidic sites. Although the treatment with n-butanol had little effect on the surface acidity of Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts, the initial heats of toluene adsorption on the 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 (158 kJ/mol) and 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 (145 kJ/mol) were significantly lower than that (179 kJ/mol) on the 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B and 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B. Thus, the density of surface metallic nickel sites seemed to be an- other factor affecting the adsorption of toluene. The Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B catalysts with higher density of nickel sites exhib- ited higher heats for the adsorption of toluene. 2.4 Catalytic hydrogenation Figure 8 presents the results for the hydrogenation of tolu- ene at 423 K over the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts reduced at 723 K. Methyl cyclohexane was found to be the only product and the conversion of toluene decreased with the WHSV of toluene for the reaction on the catalysts. The conversion of toluene was 50% and 45% over the 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B and 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B, respectively, while it was only 8% over the 90Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B, at the WHSV of toluene of 106 h â€“1 . At the same WHSV of tolu- ene, the conversion of toluene was 39% and 11% over the 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 and 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 , respectively. These results showed that the 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B and 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B exhibited higher conversions of toluene than the 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 and 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 , indicating that the treatment with n-butanol im- proved the activity of the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts for the hydro- genation of toluene. Figure 9 shows the results for the hydrogenation of phenol at 423 K over the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts reduced at 723 K. Cyclo- hexanol was found to be the main product over the catalysts, with a small amount of cyclohexanone, especially over the 90Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B at the higher WHSV of phenol (data not pre- sented). No other byproducts were observed. Fig. 9 shows that the conversion of phenol decreased with WHSV for the hy- drogenation of phenol on the catalysts. The 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B and 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B exhibited the similar high activity for the con- version of phenol with the different WHSV of phenol from 70 to 411 h â€“1 . In contrast, the 90Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B showed the low ac- tivity for the reaction. At 411 h â€“1 , the conversion of phenol was 45%, 42%, and 7% over the 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B, 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B, and 90Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B, respectively. At the same WHSV of phenol, the conversion of phenol was 13% and 7% over the 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 and 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 , respectively. Therefore, the treatment with n-butanol improved significantly the activ- ity of Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts for the hydrogenation of phenol. The 90Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B with highest loading of nickel possessed the lowest active surface area of nickel and surface acidity in the series of Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B catalysts. Thus, it adsorbed toluene with the relatively lower initial heat and coverage as com- pared to other catalysts in the series. Accordingly, it exhibited relatively low activities for the hydrogenation of toluene and phenol. The activity of supported metal catalysts for the hy- drogenation of aromatic rings depended not only on the ac- cessible active sites of surface metals, but also on the surface acid-base properties [38]. Although the 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B pos- sessed more active sites of surface nickel than the 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B, the two catalysts exhibited the similar activi- ties for the hydrogenation of toluene and phenol. The 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B was even slightly more active than the 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B for the hydrogenation of toluene and phenol at the higher WHSV of reactants. These results might be due to that the 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B possessed stronger surface acidity than the 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B [39], as measured by the microcalorimetric 25 50 75 100 0 20 40 60 80 100 90Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 80Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B C o n v e r s i o n o f t o l u e n e ( % ) WHSV of toluene (h 1 ) 60Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B Fig. 8.

HU Shenghua et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 917â€“925 adsorption of ammonia. The surface Lewis acidity dominated on the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts [40]. Apparently, the surface acidity played a key role for the hydrogenation of aromatic rings, besides the number of active sites of surface nickel. Toluene can be taken as a Lewis base due to its enriched electron den- sity on the aromatic ring with a S-bond. Thus, the surface acidity favored the adsorption and activation of aromatic rings, even for the acidic phenol [39]. The activities for the hydrogenation of toluene and phenol were higher on the Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B than on the Ni/Al 2 O 3 , since the treatment with n-butanol increased the number of active sites of surface nickel on the Ni/Al 2 O 3 -B catalysts. 3 Conclusions Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts with high loadings of nickel (60-90% weight percent) were prepared by the co-precipitation method. It was found that the loading and drying process were the two important factors in determining the number of active surface nickel atoms in the catalysts. The increase of loading of nickel increased the reducibility but decreased the dispersion of supported nickel. The 80%Ni/Al 2 O 3 exhibited relatively high loading and high dispersion of nickel. In addition, use of n-butanol during the drying process significantly increased the surface area of catalysts and the dispersion of nickel, leading to the significantly increased number of active surface nickel sites. Characterizations showed that the reduced nickel parti- cles on the Al 2 O 3 support could be as small as 4 nm, even at the high loading of 80wt%. Such catalysts with the high loading and dispersion possessed high active nickel surface areas and thus were highly active for the hydrogenation of aromatic rings in toluene and phenol. It was also found that the adsorption of toluene on nickel surface generated high initial heats, which seemed to increase with the increase of number of surface active nickel atoms and surface acidity of the Ni/Al 2 O 3 cata- lysts. Thus, the catalysts treated with n-butanol adsorbed toluene more strongly and therefore exhibited higher activity for the hydrogenation of toluene and phenol, probably due to the more surface active nickel atoms and stronger surface acidity of the catalysts.

RESEARCH PAPER Preparation of Highly Loaded and Active Ni/Al2O3 Catalysts for the Hydrogenation of Aromatic Rings Shenghua HU Mingwei XUE Hui CHEN Yinlu SUN Jianyi SHEN * Laboratory of Mesoscopic Chemistry, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, China * Corresponding author. Tel/Fax: +86-25-83594305 Highly loaded and dispersed Ni/Al2O3-B catalysts were prepared by the co-precipitation method with an n-butanol drying process. The loading of nickel and drying process were found to be the two key factors in determining the surface area and pore structures of catalysts as well as the reducibility and dispersion of supported nickel. The 80%Ni/Al2O3-B treated with n-butanol during the drying process exhibited the high surface area and high reducibility and dispersion of supported nickel, leading to the high active nickel surface area (90 m2/g-catalyst). It adsorbed toluene strongly and thus exhibited high activity for the hydrogenation of aromatic rings in toluene and phenol.
