Faculty of Physical Chemistry University of Belgrade Studentski trg 12–16 Belgrade 11158 Serbia The catalytic activity of five silver-polyaniline-polyvinylpyrrolidone (Ag@PANI@PVP1–5) nanocomposites for borohydride oxidation reaction (BOR) was thoroughly examined. The nanocomposites were synthesized by an in situ chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline monomer by Ag+ ions in the presence of accelerator – PVP and physicochemical properties were determined prior their use in electrocatalysis. Ag@PANI@PVP3 with 35.4 wt% Ag delivered the highest current density and specific current density during BOR. Evaluation of the order of reaction < 1 suggested indirect BOR mechanism. Furthermore, Ag@PANI@PVP3 also delivered the highest current density and stable performance during chronoamperometric study of BOR. Its apparent activation energy of 15 kJ mol−1 was found to be the lowest among the studied materials accounting for the high current densities.

Introduction The direct liquid fuel cells attract significant attention in recent years as devices that produce clean energy by conversion of the chemical energy of liquid fuel to the electrical energy [1]. Liquid fuel cells using alkaline solution of borohydride (BH4 ‒) as fuel have advantage of operating without organic molecules that can decrease the electrochemical activity of the catalyst, they have a high open-circuit voltage and high the theoretical energy density [2–6]. Eight electrons can be generated during direct borohydride oxidation reaction (BOR) in highly alkaline media (pH 14) (Eq. (1)) [3,4,6–10]: (1) BH4 ‒ + 8 OH− → BO2 − + 6H2O + 8 e − E0 = − 1.24 V vs. NHE However, the concurrent hydrolysis of BH4 ‒ (Eq. (2)) usually impedes its complete oxidation and decrease the number of the electrons exchanged during BOR [3,4,6–10]. (2) BH4 ‒ + H2O → BH3OH− + H2 Choosing the appropriate anodic catalyst is crucial to improve the kinetics of BOR and improve a direct borohydride fuel cell (DBFC) overall performance. Metals such as Pt [3,7,11–20], Au [14,16,21–25], Pd [4,26–33], Ag [8,20,23,34,35] and Ni [7,19,36–42] are the most tested catalysts for BOR. These metals show activity for direct oxidation of BH4 ‒; unfortunately, they also show activity for hydrolysis of NaBH4 producing hydrogen (Eq. (2)). The mechanism of BOR also depends on the experimental conditions including temperature and concentrations of NaOH and NaBH4 [43,44]. Carbon-supported silver, copper (Ag/C, Cu/C) and three different carbon-supported copper-silver (Cu@Ag/C) core-shell nanoparticles (NPs) were tested for BOR in direct borohydride hydrogen - peroxide fuel cell (DBPFC) [45]. All electrocatalysts showed good catalytic activity during BOR where Cu@Ag core/shell NPs showed higher activity than Ag/C catalyst. Thus DBPFC with Cu2@Ag1/C anode demonstrated a higher maximum power density (17.27 mW mg−1) compared to the one with Ag/C (4.31 mW mg−1). In situ FTIR spectroscopy showed a similar oxidation mechanism for all studied materials in highly alkaline solution (BH4 → BH3,ads → BH3OH− ads → BO2) [45]. BOR at carbon-supported Pt, Ag and PtAg NPs was found to proceed by different mechanisms: direct oxidation or hydrolysis followed by hydrogen oxidation in case of Pt/C and direct, but incomplete oxidation in case of Ag/C. Average number of electrons transferred between 3 and 8 was obtained for PtAg/C [20]. Ag-X (X = Au, Pt, Pd, Ir) alloys were also studied for BOR and the number of transferred electrons decreased in the order Ag-Au (4.6) > Ag-Pt (3.2) > Ag-Pd (2.1) > Ag-Ir (1.6) [46]. Similar value of the number of exchanged electrons during BOR of 4.2 was determined for Cu67Ag33/C, being higher than in case of Cu80Ag20/C, Cu50Ag50/C and Ag/C [35]. Three silver-incorporating zeolites, AgA, AgX and AgY, evaluated for BOR in authors’ previous work, showed good activity where AgY gave high peak current density at low overpotential suggesting that it could have a practical use for DBFCs [47]. Furthemore, AgY [47] as well as some other Ag-based materials, such as Ag-Ni NPs on multiwalled carbon nanotubes [48] and Ag3Sn nanointermetallic [48], also showed to be suitable as cathode electrocatalysts for DBFCs. As could be seen from the described examples, different carbon materials are typically used as supports for metal NPs in DBFC since they have high conductivity and high specific surface area. The use of conductive polymers has been recently suggested. Polyaniline (PANI) is a polymer that has different properties depending on the PANI species morphology such as one-dimensional nanocomposites and bulk PANI composites [49]. In both cases, PANI has a unique electronic structure and these composites are usually synthesized with noble metals such as Au and Ag [49,50]. Metallic particles can be spread into the PANI matrix where PANI causes a low ohmic drop [51]. These PANI/noble metal composites have found applications in sensors, corrosion protection, supercapacitors, catalysts, and batteries [49]. In this work, five composites of Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) with PANI and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) are tested for BOR in alkaline media (pH 14) by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA). Experimental Preparation of electrocatalysts Nanocomposites denoted as Ag@PANI@PVP1, 2, 4, and 5, with 3.36, 43.8, 18.9, and 44.4 wt% of Ag, respectively, were synthesized by an in situ chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline monomer by Ag+ ions in the presence of PVP as an accelerator, as described in our previous reports [52,53]. Varying molar ratios between components ([Ag +]:[PVP]:[aniline] = 3:3:1 for Ag@PANI@PVP1, 2, and 4, respectively, and [Ag+]:[PVP]:[aniline] = 3:1.5:1 for Ag@PANI@PVP5), solvent type (water, for Ag@PANI@PVP1 and 2, and methanol for Ag@PANI@PVP4 and 5), and pH (adjusted to 2 by HNO3 for Ag@PANI@PVP2, 4, and 5), affect synthetic conditions and therefore the characteristics of the final products [52,53]. Namely, nanocomposite’ dispersions denoted as Ag-PANI-PVP1 and Ag-PANI-PVP2 were prepared when the two aqueous solutions of AgNO3 and PVP with the molar ratio [AgNO3]:[PVP] =1:1 (0.12 M) were mixed with aniline monomer (0.04 M), in a total volume of 20 ml. The difference between these two syntheses is the adjustment of the pH value of reaction mixture (pH = 2) by HNO3 in the case of Ag-PANI-PVP2, immediately after adding aniline. Nanocomposites denoted as Ag@PVP-PANI4 and Ag@PVP-PANI5, were synthesized in methanol solutions of AgNO3 and PVP with the molar ratios [AgNO3]:[PVP]=1:1 (0.12:0.12 M) and [AgNO3]:[PVP]=1:0.5 (0.12:0.06 M), respectively, and mixed with the aniline monomer (0.04 M) in a total volume of 20 ml with adjusted pH values of both reaction mixtures (pH = 2) by HNO3. All prepared nanocomposite’ dispersions were stirred for 20 h at room temperature and rinsed with acetone three times to remove PVP excess. Then, precipitates were dried at 30 ºC, powdered, and finally characterized. Nanocomposite Ag@PANI@PVP3 with 35.4 wt% of Ag (determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer, ICP-AES) was collected with slight differences in synthetic conditions adjustments. Typically, 0.04 M aniline was added in a total volume of 20 ml of methanol solution of AgNO3 and PVP in molar ratio 1:1 (0.12:0.12 M). Within 20 h of constant stirring in a round bottom flask at room temperature, the color of the reaction mixture changes from light yellow, to brown and dark green olive, pointing out the end of the polymerization process, and nanocomposite’ formation. Nanocomposite’ dispersion was also washed three times with acetone, as with the previous dispersions mentioned above, then dried at 30 ºC and powdered. It is noteworthy that all nanocomposites had satisfactory water solubility and stability for months. Characterization techniques Absorption spectrum of nanocomposite’ dispersion was recorded by Thermo Evolution 600 UV–Vis spectrophotometer, while Ag content in nanocomposite powder (1 mg dissolved in 5 ml of concentrated nitric acid) was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES, Spectroflame 17, operated at 4 MHz). The size, and shape of Ag crystals, their distribution and crystal structure were pictured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Jeol Ltd., Tokyo, Japan, 200 kV), and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern. The card used for identification of the phases was taken from the WebPDF-4+ database from ICDD (04–003–7259). The nanocomposite’ morphology was determined by field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM; Zeiss ULTRA plus) equipped with an energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDXS, Inca 400, Oxford Instruments). X-ray diffraction (XRD) of powdered nanocomposite was analyzed by Rigaku SmartLab Diffractometer (CuKα radiation source; step size 0.03º; scanning rate: 5 º/min). Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectrum of powdered nanocomposite, in ATR mode, was collected using Thermo Nicolet 380 FTIR Spectrophotometer in the region from 2000 to 500 cm−1, at 64 scans per spectrum. Borohydride oxidation study All electrochemical measurements were completed using Ivium V01107 Potentiostat/Galvanostat in a one–compartment glass cell of 50 ml volume with 2 M NaOH as supporting electrolyte and with graphite rod and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as counter and reference electrode, respectively. All potentials within this paper are given relative to the SCE reference. The working electrodes were prepared using PVDF as binder [47]. CV measurements were done at scan rate of 0.05 V s−1; in solutions of NaBH4 concentrations of 0.01, 0.03, 0.06, 0.09 and 0.12 M, and at temperatures from 25 to 65 °C where the temperature was controlled using a Haake F3 bath. Ag@PANI@PVP nanocomposites were also examined by chronoamperometry in 0.03 M NaBH4 for 1 h. Results and discussion Physicochemical features of Ag@PANI@PVP nanocomposites According to our previously reported nanocomposites based on Ag, PANI and PVP [52–54], analogous material, denoted as Ag@PANI@PVP3, with some adjustments in the synthetic procedure was prepared. The formation of Ag@PANI@PVP3 was indicated during the preparation procedure, with the change of the dispersion’ color from light yellow (at the beginning, upon Ag+ dissolution in methanol) to dark olive green, designative to PANI in its conductive emeraldine salt form [55]. Besides, the formation of protonated PANI form is confirmed by the appearance of its characteristic band at 605 nm (Fig. 1 ). However, this absorption maximum, attributed to π–polaron transition [55], is blue-shifted in comparison to the literature data, claimed by Stejskal et al. [55]. This shifting could stem from reduced protonation degree of PANI chains, i.e., conjugation length, as well as the influence of the surrounding environment, AgNPs and PVP molecules. Comparing it to the positions of the same transition in the other four nanocomposites, visible at same or higher wavelengths (640, 600, 870, and 870 nm for Ag@PANI@PVP1, 2, 4, and 5, respectively, Fig. 1 , Inset), one may say that the synthetic conditions are of great significant for the PANI protonation level. The other two bands characteristic for PANI emeraldine salt form, originating from π–π* transition in benzenoid rings and polaron–π* transition, are clearly seen in UV–Vis spectrum (Fig. 1) at 335 and 402 nm, respectively [55]. In addition, band with maximum at 402 nm is wide and of great intensity probably because it's overlapping with characteristic surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of spherical AgNPs, generally manifested at 410–415 nm [56]. However, adjusting the pH of the reaction mixture in methanol to 2, regardless the molar ratios between components of Ag@PANI@PVP4 and 5, lead to the formation of triangular AgNPs manifested (and later confirmed by TEM, [52]) through three SPR bands at 330, 407–409, and 474–479 nm (Fig. 1, Inset). Together with aniline monomer oxidation (polymerization) to PANI, Ag+ ions were reduced to metallic Ag. This in situ reaction represents typical electron donor – electron acceptor reaction, where one group of reaction participants is oxidized (aniline monomers), and the other is reduced (Ag+ ions). Since Ag+, as one-electron oxidant, has relatively low electrode potential (0.8 V), compared for example to Au3+ or APS (1.498, and 2.0 V, respectively) [52,53,57], and accordingly not enough “power” to launch polymerization reaction in short period of time (several minutes or hours in the order of magnitude), there was a need for an initial spark. PVP take on a role of an accelerator that will induce polymerization, and shorten the reaction initiation phase. As an amphiphilic molecule, PVP is soluble in methanol and easily bonded to polar molecules such as aniline. There is a similarity with Ag+, whose reduction begins upon dissolution in methanol. In this manner, PVP represents the connection/bridge between Ag+ and aniline, making their interaction faster and more efficient. Beside its accelerating effect, PVP also has a role of stabilizing agent that will affect the formation of AgNPs, preventing their agglomeration during particles’ growth through steric hindrance effect [58]. Nanoparticles’ growth in different crystallographic orientations and their agglomeration are partially limited, while methanol by decelerating Ag+ dissociation reduces the rate of reduction and nucleation, enabling the formation of mostly spherical AgNPs, with spheres from 10 to 40 nm in diameter (Fig. 2a , Table 1 ). However, pH of the solution will also affect AgNPs’ growth. Acidic environment provides suitable conditions for the formation of smaller particles, since the speed of nucleation is greater than the speed of the particle's growth, as in the case of Ag@PANI@PVP2 nanocomposite reported previously, with finely shaped, uniform 7 nm spheres [53]. The same synthetic conditions, but at higher pH, as in Ag@PANI@PVP1, resulted in the formation of nearly spherical 120 nm AgNPs [53]. Nevertheless, AgNPs from Ag@PANI@PVP3 nanocomposite are highly crystallized, with (111) crystallographic plane clearly visible in magnified TEM image (Fig. 2a, Inset), and additional ones revealed by SAED (Fig. 2b). As already mentioned above, according to the UV–Vis spectra of Ag@PANI@PVP4 and 5, the formation of triangular AgNPs was assumed, and later confirmed in TEM, where truncated triangular particles with edges’ lengths 50–150 and 25–140 nm for Ag@PANI@PVP4 and 5, respectively, are revealed [52]. Furthermore, in the case of Ag@PANI@PVP3 nanocomposite, granular morphology of PANI matrix was visible in the FE-SEM image (Fig. 2c,d), while its corresponding EDX spectrum (Fig. 2c, Inset) and elemental mapping (Fig. 2e) confirm presence of Ag from NPs and C, N, and O from PANI and PVP part of nanocomposite. As the most common PANI morphology, it is also observable in Ag@PANI@PVP1, 2, and 4 nanocomposites, while Ag@PANI@PVP5 has wrinkled PANI matrix [52,53]. According to Murugesan et al. [59], the structure of PANI matrix is dependable on PVP organization in water. If we assume disparate PVP molecules organization in methanol relative to water, one may say that the PANI matrix morphology is a reflection of PVP organization in the surrounding medium. In the FTIR spectrum of Ag@PANI@PVP3 (Fig. 3a ), the most visible band at 1673 cm−1 could be attributed to CO= stretching vibrations in PVP molecules [60]. Its position is shifted relative to the same vibration of pure PVP (detected at 1660 cm−1) [60], indicating interaction of PVP with AgNPs and PANI part of the nanocomposite. In addition, bands at 1466, 1443, 1423, 1376, and 1293 cm−1 also confirm the presence of PVP in the nanocomposite [60–62]. Vibrations indicative for PANI, originating from C–C stretching vibrations in benzenoid units, and C–N stretching of secondary aromatic amine, are positioned at 1495, and 1324 cm−1, respectively [63]. The small intensity vibration positioned at 1173 cm−1 could be attributable to PVP and vibration of Q = NH+ – B units characteristic for PANI-ES form. This vibration, indicative for PANI-ES form, among all, is also present in the other four nanocomposites [52,53], confirming the formation of PANI in its doped, conductive state in all five nanocomposites. Face-centered cubic (fcc) crystallographic structure of AgNPs formed in Ag@PANI@PVP3 nanocomposite was determined by the detection of its characteristic peaks at 38.2, 44.5, 64.4, 77.6, and 81.8° for 2θ (Fig. 3b). Based on WebPDF-4+ database from ICDD (04–003–7259) for silver, they originate from (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) Bragg reflections, respectively. This crystallographic structure of AgNPs is confirmed in other nanocomposites as well [52,53]. Borohydride oxidation at Ag@PANI@PVP electrocatalysts CVs of Ag@PANI@PVP3 and 4, typical for Ag-based materials in deaerated alkaline media, are presented in Fig. 4 (see ref. [52,53] for CVs of Ag@PANI@PVP1, 2 and 5). These CVs show two anodic peaks in the potential range from 0.12 to 0.25 V corresponding to the formation of Ag2O and AgO, and two cathodic peaks in the potential range from -0.003 to -0.1 V corresponding to the reduction of formed silver oxides [8,53]. Duan et al. previously reported the presence of OH− chemically adsorbed on the Ag surface in potential range from -0.9 to 0.2 V [45]. CVs of five Ag@PANI@PVP in 0.03 M NaBH4 alkaline solution show multiple oxidation peaks (Fig. 5A , B). Oxidation peak a1 appeared at ca. -0.3 V for Ag@PANI@PVP1, 3, 4 and 5, and at -0.11 V for Ag@PANI@PVP2. Ag@PANI@PVP3 showed the highest a1 peak current density of 4.25 mA cm−2 during BOR (Table 2 ) suggesting ca. 35 wt.% Ag as the optimum Ag content in such nanocomposites. Though direct comparison with the literature data is rather difficult because of different experimental conditions (electrolyte composition, scan rate, etc.), it should be mentioned that Ag@PANI@PVP3 showed higher peak current density than, for example, Ag3Sn, that in turn showed higher peak current density than pure Ag [64]. Oxidation peak a2 is observed for Ag@PANI@PVP1, 3 and 5 at potentials of 0.02–0.09 V, i.e., potentials where AgOH layer and Ag oxide are formed suggesting that these forms are active towards BOR. Ag@PANI@PVP3 again showed the highest a2 peak current density of 3.74 mA cm−2 followed by Ag@PANI@PVP5 (2.43 mA cm−2). The same position of the anodic peaks was observed for BOR at Ag/C, Cu1@Ag1/C, Cu2@Ag1/C, Cu4@Ag1/C, and Cu/C [45]. The peaks a1 and a2 are usually attributed to the oxidation of BH3OH− generated by the hydrolysis/indirect oxidation of BH4 − and to the direct oxidation of BH4 − [3,8,9,45]. BH3 − formation on the Ag/C surface was observed at E < −0.47 V (Eq. (3)) where the self-poisoning effect of Ag surface started by a combination of BH3,ads − and OH− forms to produce BH3OH− ads (Eq. (4)). Shifting potential value over −0.37 V leads to electrooxidation of BH3OH− ads to BO2 − (Eq. (5)) [45]. A broad shoulder in case of Ag@PANI@PVP3 with measurable current densities at potentials as low as −1 V suggest that oxidation of H2 (generated during hydrolysis) proceeds at a notable extent. (3) BH4 − + * + OH− → BH3,ads + H2O + 2e− (4) BH3,ads + OH− → BH3OH− ads (5) BH3OH− ads + 6OH− → BO2 − + 5H2O + 6e− CVs of all nanocomposites display an oxidation peak (c1) in a potential range from -0.41 to -0.55 V, while CVs of Ag@PANI@PVP1 and Ag@PANI@PVP3 display an additional oxidation peak (c2) at ca. 0.3 V on the reverse scan (Fig. 5A, Table 2). These peaks were reported to present oxidation of BH3OH− and BH3OH− ads [9]. Chronoamperometric study of BOR at Ag@PANI@PVP nanocomposites at 0 V during 1 h (Fig. 5D) confirmed the best performance of Ag@PANI@PVP3 as it again gave the highest current density (1.74 mA cm−2) followed by Ag@PANI@PVP5 (0.26 mA cm−2) and Ag@PANI@PVP2 (0.174 mA cm−2) in 3600th s, respectively. In accordance with CV study, Ag@PANI@PVP1 gave the lowest current density (0.024 mA cm−2) in 3600th s. Noise seen in CA curve of Ag@PANI@PVP3 is believed to result from H2 gas evolution and its bubbles detachment from the electrode surface [65], rather than from detachment of Ag NPs from the polymer support. As mentioned above, H2 gas is generated during BH4 − hydrolysis and the rate of H2 evolution can be correlated to BH4 − hydrolysis rate at a given catalysts and its selectivity [66]. Faradaic current density decrease of only ca. 12% observed during CA measurement (after capacitance current fade at the beginning of measurement) corroborates stability of the herein tested Ag@PANI@PVP3. Furthermore, Ag@PANI@PVP2–5 delivered increasing peak current densities with increased concentrations of NaBH4 solution (Fig. 5E); for instance, a1 peak current density of Ag@PANI@PVP3 increased from 1.78 to 10.47 mA cm−2 for increase of concertation from 0.01 M to 0.12 M. The observed linear correlation of peak current density and concentration of NaBH4 solution pointed to the irreversibility of BH4 − oxidation process. The only exception was Ag@PANI@PVP1 that presented decreased peak current densities at concentrations above 0.03 M. This behavior of Ag@PANI@PVP1 could be a consequence of increased rate of BH4 − hydrolysis in the NaBH4 solutions of higher concentrations [3]. Some degree of hydrolysis and indirect BOR mechanism was also evident for Ag@PANI@PVP2-5 from the determined values of order of reaction, β. Namely, β of four nanocomposites was found to be <1, in the range of 0.57 to 0.68 evidencing electrode surface poisoning by reactions intermediates. Similar values were observed in case of BOR at Au-PANI (2 wt.% of Au) (β = 0.5) [67] and CuPPy (β = 0.67) [68], while values close to 1 were determined for Au-PANI with 28.9 wt% of Au [67], AuPPy (polypyrrole) [68], as well as for Au-Pt NPs on poly(p-aminophenol) [69] and Pt NPs on PPy-carbon (5 – 35 wt.% of C) (Pt/PPy-C) composites [2]. Similarly, β of 0.8 evaluated for Ag/C nanobars indicated that BH4 − oxidation is the first-order reaction [70]. Braesch et al. showed that increasing concentrations of NaBH4 solution increase the number of adsorbates (intermediates formed during BOR or hydrolysis of BH4 −) on the poisoned surface of electrocatalyst [71]. Fig. 5F shows anodic scans of Ag@PANI@PVP3 at temperatures from 25 to 65 °C with a1 peak current densities increase from 4.24 to 9.29 mA cm−2 at 25 and 65 °C, respectively. The other electrocatalysts showed similar behavior as Ag@PANI@PVP3. The apparent activation energy, Ea app, for BOR is determined in the selected temperature range by using the Arrhenius equation [4,8] and found to increase in the following order Ag@PANI@PVP3 (15 kJ mol−1) < Ag@PANI@PVP5 (16 kJ mol−1) < Ag@PANI@PVP4 (17 kJ mol−1) < Ag@PANI@PVP2 (18 < Ag@PANI@PVP1 (22 kJ mol−1). The lowest activation energy in case of Ag@PANI@PVP3 contributes to its best catalytic performance among five nanocomposites. Somewhat lower value of Ea app of 12.6 kJ mol−1 was found for BOR at AgY zeolite under the same conditions [47]. The Ea app values were similar to that of AuPANIs (12.6 and 14.1 kJ mol−1) [67], Pt/PPy-C composites (10 – 18 kJ mol−1) [2], AuPPy (16 kJ mol−1) and CuPPy (22 kJ mol−1) [68]. Conversely, radiolytically synthesized nano Ag/C catalysts exhibited Ea app of 35 kJ mol−1 during BOR [8], a value more than two times higher than Ea app of herein tested Ag@PANI@PVP3. Ea app for BOR at Pd/c-PANI2 and Pd/Vul2 were determined to be even higher, i.e., 47.3 and 48.3 kJ mol−1, respectively [4]. Comparison with noble metal-based electrocatalysts supported on carbon material reveals notably lower herein determined Ea app than in case of Ag/C nanobars (Ea as high as 57.2 kJ mol−1) [70]. Correlating electrocatalytic activity of five nanocomposites with synthesis conditions and their physico-chemical characteristics (summarised in Table 1) reveals that more than one parameter governs the electrochemical activity. The optimum performance was observed in case of Ag-PANI-PVP with ca. 35 wt.% Ag. Its higher activity compared to Ag-PANI-PVP2 and 5 with higher amount of Ag of ca. 44 wt.% might be due to agglomeration of PVP during the synthesis procedure involving addition of acid. Namely, these agglomerates might act as insulating island interrupting the conductive network [52,53]. Lower extent of polymer protonation (synthesis without added acid) results in PANI chain - PANI chain interactions “overpowering” PVP-PVP and PANI-PVP interactions. This further results in the effective development of 3D interconnected conducting network facilitating charge transfer. Consequently, Ag-PANI-PVP1, 3 and 4 deliver higher specific current densities than Ag-PANI-PVP2 and 5. Additionally, interaction of PVP with different Ag crystal facets was reported to govern materials’ response [52,53]. Namely, partial blocking of Ag (111) by facet PVP was reported while Ag (220) was reported to remain free and to be responsible for electrocatalysis. Finally, Ag NPs of Ag-PANI-PVP3 are smaller compared to those of Ag-PANI-PVP1 and 4, and that, along with their high dispersion within the polymer matrix, can lead to higher electrochemically active surface area and higher number of active sites. Conclusion Five silver-polyaniline-polyvinylpyrrolidone nanocomposites (Ag@PANI@PVP1–5) with different content of Ag were evaluated for BOR in highly alkaline media. The optimum Ag content was found to be ca. 35 wt.%. Namely, Ag@PANI@PVP3 showed a stable performance with the highest current density as well as the highest specific current density during both voltammetry and chronoamperometry measurements. The highest current densities in the case of Ag@PANI@PVP3 were corroborated by the lowest activation energy for BOR (15 kJ mol−1). Reaction order β for Ag@PANI@PVP2–5 was found to be 0.57 - 0.68 indicating electrocatalysts’ surface poisoning by reaction intermediates, i.e., some degree of hydrolysis and indirect BOR mechanism.

        "dc:description": "The catalytic activity of five silver-polyaniline-polyvinylpyrrolidone (Ag@PANI@PVP1–5) nanocomposites for borohydride oxidation reaction (BOR) was thoroughly examined. The nanocomposites were synthesized by an in situ chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline monomer by Ag+ ions in the presence of accelerator – PVP and physicochemical properties were determined prior their use in electrocatalysis. Ag@PANI@PVP3 with 35.4 wt% Ag delivered the highest current density and specific current density during BOR. Evaluation of the order of reaction < 1 suggested indirect BOR mechanism. Furthermore, Ag@PANI@PVP3 also delivered the highest current density and stable performance during chronoamperometric study of BOR. Its apparent activation energy of 15 kJ mol−1 was found to be the lowest among the studied materials accounting for the high current densities.",
