Keywords Oxygen evolution reaction N-doping Metal oxyhydroxide Precatalysts Nickel sulfide 1 Introduction Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is involved in many important energy conversion systems, including rechargeable metal-air battery [1–3], electrocatalytic CO2 reduction [4–6], electrocatalytic N2 fixation [7], and water splitting [8–11], etc. Due to multiple proton-coupled electron transfer steps and slow kinetics of OER, efficient catalysts should be used to improve the performance [12–14]. Ir/Ru-based compounds are the benchmark electrocatalysts with high activity, but the high cost and low abundance hinder their application [15–17]. Researchers have invested considerable effort to develop inexpensive and efficient OER catalysts [18–21]. In particular, the first-row (3d) transition-metal compounds including sulphides [22–25], phosphides [26–28], selenides [29,30] borides [31–33] and nitrides [34–37] have been extensively studied. According to the recent studies, the surface of nickel sulfide should be partly or completely converted to nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) during the in-situ electrochemical oxidation process [38–41]. The key to improve the OER activity is how to modulate the electronic structure of NiOOH [42–44]. The adjustment of NiOOH has been the focus of OER electrocatalysis, such as bimetallic or trimetallic oxyhydroxides (NiFeOOH, MoNiFeOOH, WCoFeOOH etc.) have been attracting widely interest because of their excellent OER activity in alkaline electrolytes [45–47]. However, the challenges still remain due to the large overpotential. Therefore, we proposed non-metal element doping of metal oxyhydroxides. Herein, we creatively report NiFeOOH is greatly activated by N-doping to get an efficient oxygen evolution catalyst. DFT calculation reveals that N-doping would lower the d-band center of the metal atoms in top layer while adsorbing OH (OOH), and in turn increase the adsorption ability of intermediate *OH, and *OOH on the surface of NiFeOOH, thereby reducing the OER overpotential. The N-doped NiFeOOH is in-situ derived from N-(NiFe)3S2 precatalyst by electrochemical oxidation. The experiment results and theoretical calculations suggest that N-NiFeOOH is an efficient electrocatalyst for OER. The key role of N-doping in the NiFeOOH for enhancing OER performance is reported for the first time. The N-NiFeOOH shows high OER activity with low overpotentials of 245 and 278 mV at the current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively, and a small Tafel slope of 35.3 mV dec−1. In the stability test of rechargeable Zn-air battery, N-NiFeOOH shows great durability for two weeks especially the very stable charging process corresponding to OER. This work will shed light on the design of the metal oxyhydroxides doped with non-metallic element. In this work, a method for fabricating N-NiFeOOH by in-situ electrochemical transformation of N-decorated (NiFe)3S2 precatalyst is reported for the first time. We report that NiFeOOH is activated by N-doping to be an efficient oxygen evolution catalyst (Fig. 1 a). Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images (Fig. 1b, 1c and Fig. S2) demonstrate that N-(NiFe)3S2 nanosheets were uniformly coated on the NiFe foam and the thickness of nanosheets is ~10 nm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 1d and Fig. S3) reveal that the thickness of N-(NiFe)3S2 nanosheets is ~10 nm. High resolution TEM image (Fig. 1e) shows one lattice fringe spacing of N-(NiFe)3S2 is 2.46 Å, which is smaller than the distance of (110) planes of hexagonal Ni3S2 (2.87 Å, JCPDS 44-1418) due to the Fe-doping [56]. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrums and mapping images (insert in Fig. 1e) show that the related elements are uniformly distributed in N-(NiFe)3S2. The XRD pattern (Fig. 1f) of N-(NiFe)3S2 shows a set of diffraction peaks at 21.8°, 31.1° and 37.8° from hexagonal Ni3S2 (JCPDS 44-1418) [56]. However, all the diffraction peaks belonging to Ni3S2 shifted to the right, indicating that the lattice spacing decreased due to the incorporation of Fe [56]. X-ray depth analysis was performed to further investigate the chemical composition of N-(NiFe)3S2 precatalyst. The atomic ratio of N/Ni (Fig. S4) gradually decreases with etching time, indicating that the closer to the surface, the higher amount of nitrogen. Raman spectroscopy was carried out to analyze the surface substance of N-(NiFe)3S2 after OER. Fig. 1g exhibits two main peaks at 481 and 552 cm−1, which are known as the vibration peaks of NiOOH [40,57]. X-ray depth analysis was also performed to investigate the chemical composition after OER. Fig. 1h shows that the closer to the surface, the higher atomic ratio of O/Ni, indicating that the surface has changed into NiOOH. Fig. 1i shows that the high amount of nitrogen still remains in the surface. As shown in Fig. S5, X-ray depth analysis shows that the closer to the surface, the higher amount of nitrogen. After electrochemical oxidation, the Ni 2p spectrum (Fig. 2 a), consisting of two spin–orbit doublets of Ni 2p3/2 (855.6 eV), Ni 2p1/2 (873.2 eV) and two satellites, can be indexed as NiOOH; while the disappearance of a pair of peaks of Ni 2p3/2 at 852.5 eV and Ni 2p1/2 at 869.7 eV can be assigned to the electrochemical conversion of nickel sulphides [45,56–59]. The Fe 2p spectra (Fig. 2b) show that Fe is trivalent. No S was observed in the S 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. 2c), which was related to the disappearance of the peaks of Ni 2p3/2 (852.5 eV) and Ni 2p1/2 (869.7 eV). However, N can still be observed in the N 1s XPS spectrum(Fig. 2d), and the peak migrates from 398.5 eV to 399.2 eV, meaning that N is converted from N3− of the residual NH moieties to higher N2− of the substituted O2− in the NiFeOOH [60,61]. The results confirmed the in-situ conversion of N-(NiFe)3S2 precatalyst to N-NiFeOOH. As control group, NiFeOOH catalyst in-situ derived from (NiFe)3S2 precatalyst (Figs. S6, S7) were synthesized to investigate the effect of N-doping. XRD patterns (Fig. S8) of (NiFe)3S2 precatalyst and N-(NiFe)3S2 precatalyst show a set of diffraction peaks at 22.1°, 31.4° and 38.1°, which belong to Ni3S2 (JCPDS 44-1418) [48]. The peaks shift to right are due to the incorporation of Fe. XPS spectra of (NiFe)3S2 precatalyst (Fig. S9) shows there is no N element. Elemental maping images (Fig. S10) indicate that Ni, Fe and S are distributed uniformly in the (NiFe)3S2 nanosheets. The as-prepared electrodes were directly applied to a conventional three-electrode system as the working electrode in a 1 M KOH electrolyte for OER electrocatalysis and polarization curves were recorded at a low scan rate of 0.02 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the N-NiFeOOH shows the lowest overpotential of 243 mV to deliver 10 mA cm−2, which is 54 mV lower than that of NiFeOOH (287 mV). In particular, at the overpotential of 278 mV, N-NiFeOOH exhibits a current density up to 100 mA cm−2, which is 12-fold higher than NiFeOOH, demonstrating a great enhancement of the catalytic activity toward the OER. N-NiFeOOH shows much lower overpotential than NiFeOOH, suggesting that N-doping significantly improves OER activity. Additionally, we observed a very small Tafel slope of 35.3 mV dec−1 in low overpotential ranges (Fig. 3b), which are smaller than that of NiFeOOH (67.0 mV dec−1), indicating a fast kinetics during the OER. To confirm the origin of the activity, the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) was measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) test. Figs. S11 and S12 show that the Cdl of (NiFe)3S2 and N-(NiFe)3S2 are 21.55 and 11.13 mF cm−2, respectively. As shown in Fig. S13, the normalized polarization curves show that the catalytic activity of N-NiFeOOH catalyst in-situ derived from N-(NiFe)3S2 precatalyst is significantly improved compared to NiFeOOH catalyst toward the OER. It demonstrates that N-doping is a simple and effective method for increasing the catalytic activity of NiFeOOH for OER. In order to further prove the role of N-doping, NiOOH catalyst in-situ derived from Ni3S2 precatalyst (Figs. S14–S18) and N-NiOOH catalyst in-situ derived from N-Ni3S2 precatalyst (Figs. S19–S22) were synthesized for building a multivariant comparison system. As shown in Fig. 3a, the N-NiOOH shows an overpotential of 320 mV to deliver 10 mA cm−2, which is 34 mV lower than the potential of NiOOH (354 mV). In particular, at the overpotential of 377 mV, the current density of NiOOH is as high as 100 mA cm−2, which is 5 times higher than that of the NiOOH, indicating that the OER catalytic activity is greatly improved. The N-NiOOH shows much lower overpotential than NiOOH, suggesting that N-doping significantly improves OER activity. Additionally, we observed a small Tafel slope of 54.6 mV dec−1 in low overpotential ranges (Fig. 3b), which are smaller than that of NiOOH (87.9 mV dec−1), indicating a fast kinetics during the OER. To confirm the origin of the activity, Cdl was measured by CV test. Figs. S23 and S24 show that the Cdl of Ni3S2 and N-Ni3S2 are 22.97 and 14.38 mF cm−2, respectively. As expected, even with ECSA normalization (Fig. S25), the intrinsic catalytic activity of N-NiOOH is significantly improved compared to NiOOH. All of the above experimental observations suggest that N-doping is an effective way to improve the activity of hydroxide in-situ derived from sulfides precatalyst and the performance of N-NiFeOOH electrocatalystfor OER is comparable to the most excellent non-noble catalysts reported (Fig. 3c) [45,46,62]. Electrochemical stability is another key indicator for evaluating the electrocatalytic performance. Hence, the constant chronopotentiometry measurement of 10 mA cm−2 was carried out to evaluate the durability of N-NiFeOOH. It exhibits no evident change in overpotential after 120 h test as shown in Fig. 3d and confirm the excellent durability of the N-NiFeOOH catalyst for the OER in an alkaline electrolyte. The ORR catalytic ability of N-NiFeOOH was measured in O2-saturated 1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte, and as comparison also measured in A2-saturated 1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. As shown in Fig. S26, N-NiFeOOH shows an onset potential of 0.90 V in O2-saturated electrolyte. The N-NiFeOOH electrode with acceptable catalytic activity for ORR is significant for the practical applications of Zn-air batteries. Thus, N-NiFeOOH was applied in a home-made liquid Zn-air battery (Fig. 3e). A charge-discharge cycle test (Fig. 3f) was performed with a current density of 15 mA cm−2 for 2000 discharging/charging cycles (10 min for 1 cycle). In the stability test of rechargeable Zn-air battery, N-NiFeOOH shows greatly durability for two weeks, especially the charging process corresponding to OER is very stable. The contact angle measurement (Fig. S27) were conducted. The water contact angle of N-(NiFe)3S2 (81.6°) is slightly lower than that of (NiFe)3S2 (98.0°). The slight change in hydrophilic properties should not be the reason for the significant improvement in OER performance. The first-principles method is applied to explore the effect of Fe doping (NiFeOOH), and Fe and N co-doping (N-NiFeOOH) on the performance of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on γ-NiOOH. Here, the doping represents the substitutional doping for short. The atomic configurations of NiOOH and the NiFeOOH are as taken from previous work [48], as shown in Fig. S1. The theoretical results show that N will be much easier to dope into bulk NiOOH after the Fe doping. This could be concluded by the values of the N formation energy at the most stable site in bulk NiOOH and bulk NiFeOOH ones, e.g., the value in latter one is 1.90 eV smaller than that in the fromer one (1.51 eV vs 3.41 eV). The detail discussions are in Supporting Information. According to the most stable bulk ones determined, the (0 1 −1 2) surfaces are established for further exploration of OER activity on them. The process of OER involves four steps, H2O + * →*OH + H+ + e−, *OH → *O + H+ + e−, H2O + *O → *OOH + H+ + e−, *OOH → O2 + H+ + e−. The free energy change of OER step on (0 1 –1 2) surface of NiOOH, NiFeOOH, and N-NiFeOOH are as shown in Fig. 4 a–c, and the detail atomic configurations for the corresponding intermediate species of OER are also listed. It is clearly shown that the overpotential have a decrease trend from pure one to the Fe and N co-doped one, and the corresponding values are 0.64 eV (NiOOH), 0.57 eV (NiFeOOH), and 0.47 eV (N-NiFeOOH), respectively. The smaller the overpotential, the higher the OER activity. According to the DFT results, the Fe doping could enhance the OER activity of NiOOH, which is consistent with previous experiment and theoretical works [48–51]. Those results also clearly indicate the further N doping make the OER activity even higher. In additional, the potential determined step (PDS) are the third and first, and first step on (0 1 –1 2) surface of pure, Fe doped, and Fe and N co-doped NiOOH, respectively. The OER activity is related with formation energy of the intermediate, and the corresponding formation energy strongly depends on the electronic properties [63,64]. Here, relationship between formation energy of intermediate *OH (E OH), and *OOH (E OOH) on above surfaces and the d-band center (E d) of the metal atoms in top layer are explored, as shown in Fig. 4d. It clearly shows the E OH has a positive relationship with E d, whereas E OOH show a negative relationship with E d. The closer to fermi level the E d is, the larger (smaller) the E OH (E OOH) is. The opposite trends could be attributed to the different interactions between adsorbed OH or OOH and (0 1 –1 2) surfaces, similar discussions could also been seen in previous work [52–54]. As shown in Fig. 4d, the E d for surfaces with adsorbed OH (OOH) is −2.77 eV (−2.99 eV) on NiOOH, −1.68 eV (−2.92 eV) on NiFeOOH, and −1.89 eV (−1.32 eV) on N-NiFeOOH, respectively. In detail, once the NiOOH is doped by Fe, the E d for slab with adsorbed OH, and OOH increased by 1.09 and 0.07 eV, respectively. However, further N doping in NiFeOOH will make the corresponding E d decrease by 0.21 eV for slab with OH, and increase by 1.60 eV for slabs with OOH, respectively. Thus, E OOH decreases on the surfaces in the order of NiOOH (3.42 eV), NiFeOOH (3.36 eV) and N-NiFeOOH (2.96 eV), whereas E OH increases on the surfaces in the order of NiOOH (0.03 eV), N-NiFeOOH (1.26 eV) and NiFeOOH (1.36 eV). Combining with the free energy changes of OER diagram on Fig. 4a–c, we could explain that the PDS changes from third step (H2O + *O → *OOH + H+ + e−) on NiOOH to the first step (H2O + * → *OH + H+ + e−) on NiFeOOH and N-NiFeOOH, and the change of the overpotential for the three slabs. Thus, we could tune the d-band center of NiOOH by Fe and N doping, in turn tune adsorption ability of the intermediate of OER, and tune the OER activity in the end. The similar discussions about hydrogen evolution activity on N doped molybdenum carbide could be found in previous work [55]. In summary, we proposed non-metal element doping of metal oxyhydroxides, and verified that NiFeOOH was greatly activated by N-doping to get an efficient oxygen evolution catalyst. The theoretical calculations reveal that N-doping would reduce the OER overpotential of the catalyst through tuning the d-band center of meatl atoms, and suggest that N-NiFeOOH is the efficient OER catalysts. N-NiFeOOH exhibits superior performance with a low overpotential of 278 mV at the current density of 100 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope of 35.3 mV dec−1, which is comparable to the most excellent non-noble catalysts. This work provides a new concept to enhance the OER activity of the in-situ formed metal oxyhydroxides via the non-metallic element doping of precatalysts.

        "dc:description": "Metal oxyhydroxides are regarded as active catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we creatively report NiFeOOH is greatly activated by N-doping to get an efficient OER catalyst. The effect of N-doping in the resulted metal oxyhydroxides for the OER is revealed for the first time. N-doped NiFeOOH (N-NiFeOOH) is in-situ derived from N-(NiFe)3S2 precatalyst by electrochemical oxidation. N-NiFeOOH exhibits superior performance with a low overpotential of 278 mV at the current density of 100 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope of 35.3 mV dec−1, which is comparable to the most excellent non-noble catalysts. DFT calculations reveal that N-doping would lower the d-band center of the surface metal atoms and in turn increase the adsorption ability of *OH on NiFeOOH, thereby reducing the OER overpotential. The key role of N-doping in the NiFeOOH for enhancing OER performance is reported for the first time, which will shed light on the design of catalysts.",
