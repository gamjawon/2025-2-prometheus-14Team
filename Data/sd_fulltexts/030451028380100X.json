P. J. VERLAAN, R. ZWIERS and G. CHALLA Laboratory of Polymer Chemistry, State University of Groningen, Nijenborgh 16, 9747 AG Groningen (The Netherlands) (Received September 16, 1982) Summary In order to extend the investigation on soluble macromolecular imi- dazole derivatives as ligands for copper salts, two types of polymers were synthesized. Copolymerization of styrene and TV-vinylimidazole yielded macromolecular ligands of type II in which the imidazole moiety is bound directly to the polyethylene backbone. Chloromethylation of polystyrene and amination with imidazole yielded macromolecular ligands of type III in which the imidazole moiety is bound via a benzyl group to the polyethylene backbone. Both polymers gave greenish-blue soluble copper complexes. These complexes are good catalysts for the oxidative coupling of 2,6-disub- stituted phenols. They have been compared to their low molar mass analogue, TV-methylimidazole (I). As substrate, 2,6-di-t-butylphenol and 2,6-dimethylphenol were chosen. Kinetic analysis were performed. The results for all three types of catalysts and for both substrates are discussed. The activities of the macromolecular catalysts were fairly high com- pared to other systems. Moreover the polymeric catalysts showed enhance- ment of re-oxidation rates compared to the low molar mass analogue (I) due to the nonpolar field formed by the polymer ligand. Binding of ligands to macromolecules increases the steric hindrance towards substrate complexa- tion at active sites. This can be decreased by binding the ligands via spacers to the macromolecule (as in ni). Introduction In metal catalysis, imidazole derivatives very often serve as ligands or as bases [1, 2]. A great variety of imidazole metal complexes has been syn- thesized and their structure has been described, revealing many interesting coordination properties of the imidazole ligand [3]. On the other hand imidazole derivatives themselves can also serve as catalysts in many organic reactions, such as acetylation and isomerization [4-6]. The observed exceptional rate enhancement of two orders of magni- 0304-5102/83/$3.00 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 224 tude, in comparison with simple comparative pyridine-like catalysts in acety- lation reactions [4], is probably due to resonance stabilization of the imi- dazole moiety lacking in pyridine (Scheme 1).

Since imidazole derivatives are multifunctional com- pounds, as pointed out before, many research efforts have been directed towards fixation of this group on a support. Applications of these polymer- bound imidazoles are numerous [8, 9]. Metal complexes of these mostly resin-bound imidazole derivatives have been synthesized [10] and used suc- cessfully as easy separable catalysts [11]. Soluble macromolecular imidazole derivatives have been used as cata- lysts in ester hydrolysis [12]. Only a few studies have been made dealing with the application of soluble macromolecular imidazole-metal complexes in catalysis [13 -15]. We are particularly interested in the effects of binding of ligands for metal complexation to linear macromolecules on catalysis. The oxidative coupling of 2,6-disubstituted phenols by such soluble macromolec- ular catalysts has shown some interesting results [16]. Because the type of binding of ligands for metal complexation to macromolecules can influence the behaviour of the active complex, we extended our study to macromolec- ular imidazole derivatives. Depending on reaction conditions and on the substituents on the phenol, the dimer diphenoquinone (DPQ)* or the engi- neering plastic polyphenyleneoxide (PPO) are the main products (Scheme 2). *DPQ = 4-(3,5-dialkyl-4-oxo-2,5-cyclohexadiene-l-ylidene)-2,6-dialkyl-2,5-cyclohex- adiene-1-one. 225 From previous investigations it was already known that the kinetics of oxidative coupling with polymeric copper catalysts very often can be de- scribed by the Michaelis-Menten concept for enzyme catalysis [16,18] (Scheme 3), where E and E* stand for Cu(II) and Cu(I) complex respectively, S for substrate (phenol) and P for the products.

Thus normally k^^ k^eox- The active copper catalyst consists of binuclear species doubly bridged by OH\" and/or Cr, depending on the (macromolecular) ligand and the applied reaction conditions [16, 17]. In this study we compare the catalytic activities of cop- per complexes of a low molar mass imidazole ligand and two polymer-bound imidazole ligands, in order to discover possible effects of the type of binding of the ligands. Experimental Synthesis of polystyrene-co-N-vinylimidazole (II) All chemicals were p.a. quality. Vinyl monomers were distilled under reduced dinitrogen pressure. Radical copolymerization of styrene and N- vinylimidazole was performed in toluene as described previously [19]. -(CH^-CH^o-.t-CH^-CH-l; -+CH -CH-j^o-4CH -CH^ e -N, ?N (II) (III) Scheme 4 226 Synthesis ofpolystyrene-co-l-uinyl-4-(N-methyleneimidazole)benzene (III) Polymers of type III were synthesized in a two-step procedure. The first step was simple chloromethylation of linear at-polystyrene by the Galeazzi method [20]. In the second step, the partially chloromethylated polystyrene (degree of functionalization 0.05 <a< 0.25) was dissolved after charac- terization and determination of the chloro- content (elemental analysis) in N,N-dimethylformamide. After addition of a five-fold excess (to CH^Cl) of imidazole, a small amount of potassium t-butoxide as non-nucleophilic base was added. The coupling reaction was followed by sampling and IR spec- troscopy (disappearance of v C C1 at 675 cm~1). The polymers were precipi- tated in a large excess of methanol/water (9/1, v/v) containing 0.03 mol dm\"3 KC1. After filtration and washing with methanoi, the white precipitate was dried in air and redissolved in chloroform. The solution was filtered and the polymer was precipitated in methanoi containing 0.03 mol dm\"3 KC1. After filtration and washing with methanoi the white powder was dried in vacuum at 50 C. The degree of functionalization, a, was determined by elemental analysis (C,H,N,(C1)). My was determined for the starting material (polystyrene) by the Ubbelohde technique in chloroform at 25 C and was usually about 50 000. Oxidative coupling The standard reaction conditions for oxidative coupling were: T= 298.16 K, PO,= 101.3 kPa, [Cu2\"1\"] = [OH-] = 0.5 X [imidazole] = 3.32 X 10~3 mol dm\"3. Solvent mixture 1,2-dichlorobenzene/methanol = 13/2 (v/v). Total reaction volume = 0.015 dm3. Hydroxide was added as meth- anolic potassium hydroxide. The initial reaction rates, R, were determined by measuring the rates of dioxygen uptake with an automatic isobaric gas burette. Shaking speed of the reaction vessel was high enough to prevent gas-ligand dioxygen diffusion from becoming rate determining [21]. Results In order to compare JV-methylimidazole (I) as amine ligand for copper catalysts with the macromolecular ligands II and III, we started experiments at fixed copper concentration and varied total ligand concentration. Amines and copper themselves did not show any oxidative coupling activity. At relatively high degrees of functionalization of polymeric ligands (II and III), higher rates were observed than for the low molar mass analogue (Fig. 1) (for an explanation see below). For all types of catalysts, an increasing amine to copper ratio favoured C 0 coupling when 2,6-dimethylphenol was used as a substrate. This is normally found [22] and can generally be attributed to an enhancement in basicity. Since the degree of functionalization a, of the polymeric ligands is a very interesting parameter [13,16], we verified whether an increasing degree of functionalization (which is in fact a shorter ligand-to-ligand distance) 227 Fig. l.

In Fig. 2 initial dioxygen consumption rates R are shown for macromolecular ligands II and III as a function of a. Indeed, for both polymers, increasing reaction rates are obtained as a function of a. Nowadays higher rates are observed for polymer II since they are measured under pure dioxygen instead of under air [15] (see later Fig. 4). Moreover, ligand III yields higher rates than ligand II. To investigate the origin of the differences in activity between the ligands I, II and III, we started kinetic measurements with two types of substrates, namely 2,6-dimethylphenol (DMP), yielding C 0 and C C coupling products, and 2,6-di-t-butylphenol, yielding exclusively the C C coupling product (see introduction). In Figs. 3a and b the results of substrate concentration dependent measurements are shown for the ligands I, II and ni and for both phenols. The shapes of the curves with N-methylimidazole as ligand ( ) for both substrates are identical. They differ significantly from the curves obtained with n and III for DMP and DTBP, which show mutual conformity. The dioxygen consumption rates at very low phenol concentra- tions (<0.03 mol dm\"3) are the highest for the low molar mass ligand I for both substrates. At higher phenol concentrations the rates with polymeric ligands II or III exceed those with their low molar mass analogue. In order to test whether we were really measuring oxidation rates of the phenols and to verify that reoxidation of catalyst was not rate determining, 228 Fig. 3.

For both macromolecular catalysts (II and III) no influence was observed of a further increase in dioxygen pressure above 50 kPa on reaction rates. Thus above 50 kPa the reaction is clearly zero order in dioxygen. This is shown for macro- molecular ligand III and DMP as substrate in Fig. 4 (o). Obviously the re-oxidation of Cu(I) to Cu(II) (reaction (iv) in Scheme 2) is very fast as compared to reaction (i). Consequently we are really measuring substrate oxidation rates under standard conditions. In other words, step 2 in Scheme 3 is rate determining in the catalytic cycle and therefore fe; < fereox- The same dependence on dioxygen pressure is found for ligand I at very low concentrations (<0.03 mol dm\"3) for both substrates. At higher phenol concentrations, however, a first-order dependence in dioxygen is observed for both substrates. This is shown for DTBP in Fig. 4 ( ). Consequently at higher phenol concentrations and with I as ligand the re-oxidation of the catalyst becomes rate determining, and we are no longer measuring substrate oxidation rates. In this case, the rate of re-oxidation is not only dependent on dioxygen concentration but also on the type of phenol and on phenol concentration, indicating that formation of a ternary complex between cop- per, dioxygen and phenol is probably involved in the rate-determining re-oxidation step, as found before [23, 24]. 229 Fig. 4. Initial dioxygen consumption rates, R, under standard conditions as a function of dioxygen pressure. (O): polymeric ligand III with 0= 0.11 and [2.6-dimethylphenol] = 0.25 mol dm\"3; ( ): JV-methylimidazole and [2,6-di-t-butylphenol] = 0.24 mol dm~3. Discussion From the foregoing, it is obvious that fixation of imidazole to a poly- mer chain enhances the re-oxidation rate of Cu(I) to Cu(II). It is known that the re-oxidation of Cu(I) to Cu(II) is enhanced in a nonpolar environment [25]. Apparently, a nonpolar field is created due to the styrene moieties of our macromolecular ligands thus leading to bifunctional catalysis. In fact, the re-oxidation rate constants of the polymeric catalysts are increased to such an extent that we can measure phenol oxidation rates which obey Michaelis-Menten-like kinetics. The data of substrate concentration-dependent measurements for ligands n and III of Figs. 3a and b can be plotted in a Lineweaver-Burk plot. Thus reciprocal reaction rates versus reciprocal substrate concentration yield straight lines intersecting the y-axis according to the following equation: R k,[E]o &2[E]o[E]o (1) in which R is the initial dioxygen consumption rate, k^ the rate-determining rate constant, [E]o and [S]o the initial concentrations of copper salt and phenol, respectively and K^ = (k-i + k^)/ki the Michaelis constant. The results for DMP as substrate are shown in Fig. 5. After curve-fitting by linear regression, values for K^ and fe; can be calculated for both sub- strates and are given in Table 1. It clearly shown that the rate-determining rate constants k^ for both substrates are independent from the way the ligand is fixed to the macromolecule (II or III). Under identical conditions k-i solely depends on the nature of the substrate itself, and consequently on the substitutents on the phenol. The higher k^ value for DTBP than for DMP 230 Fig. 5.

Moreover, the rate-determining rate constants, k^, for both substrates are nearly ten times larger than the value of pyridine-like macromolecular ligands. This can be partly attributed to a higher basicity of the imidazole moiety. The electron-donating strength of the imidazole group at the nitro- gen at the 3-position after coordination is much higher than the value of the 231 pyridine group due to resonance (see introduction). This leads to a higher electron density on the planar copper(II) catalyst itself and favours tetra- hedral deformation around copper. The rate-determining step in oxidative polymerization implies a configurational change from planar Cu(II) to tetrahedral Cu(I) during the electron-transfer process between substrate and copper [13]. Thus due to this ligand effect the catalyst substrate complex is slightly deformed in the direction of the transition state, which resembles the final configuration of the tetrahedral Cu(I) complex. Binding of the imidazole ligand directly to the polyethylene backbone, instead of via a benzyl spacer, creates a more crowded catalytic site. Because &2 is independent from the nature of the polymer ligand, changes in K^n1 = fei/(A-i+fe2) reflect changes in K.i = fci/fc-i. Thus the accessibility of the active sites derived from polymer ligand III is higher than that of II, as can be seen from the increasing K^-1 for both substrates in going from II to III. Assuming that fe; for the low molar mass catalyst derived from I also equals the k^ values for the polymeric catalysts, the initial slope of the curves in Figs. 3a and b are a direct measure of Km~1, since at very low phenol con- centrations eqn. (1) transforms into: ^[Ed[s1 (2) K-m Obviously, the low molar mass catalyst has higher Km\\ values for both sub- strates pointing to even better accessibility of the sites. This is in complete agreement with the results discussed above for polymer ligands n and III, in terms of steric hindrance. Conclusions The utilization of (macromolecular) imidazole derivatives as ligands for copper yields promising oxidative coupling catalysts for 2,6-disubstituted phenols. The behaviour of macromolecular imidazole copper complexes is quite normal and the kinetics of oxidative coupling can be described by the Michaelis-Menten concept. Bifunctionality of the macromolecular ligands finds expression in the enhancement of the re-oxidation rate constant compared to the low molar mass analogue. Binding of the ligands for catalytic centers to a polymer backbone decreases the accessibility of the centers, as was shown by decreasing equilib- rium constants for substrate complexation. Introduction of a spacer enhances the accessibility of active sites bound to a macromolecule, although the intrinsic catalytic activity remains un- altered. The intrinsic activity is nearly ten times higher than the value for the pyridine analogues. 232 References 1 V. S. Sharma and J. Schubert, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 91 (1969) 6291. 2 L. Casella, M.

        "dc:description": "In order to extend the investigation on soluble macromolecular imidazole derivatives as ligands for copper salts, two types of polymers were synthesized. Copolymerization of styrene and N-vinylimidazole yielded macromolecular ligands of typeII in which the imidazole moiety is bound directly to the polyethylene backbone. Chloromethylation of polystyrene and amination with imidazole yielded macromolecular ligands of type III in which the imidazole moiety is bound via a benzyl group to the polyethylene backbone. Both polymers gave greenish-blue soluble copper complexes. These complexes are good catalysts for the oxidative coupling of 2,6-disubstituted phenols. They have been compared to their low molar mass analogue, N-methylimidazole (I). As substrate, 2,6-di-t-butylphenol and 2,6-dimethylphenol were chosen. Kinetic analysis were performed. The results for all three types of catalysts and for both substrates are discussed. The activities of the macromolecular catalysts were fairly high compared to other systems. Moreover the polymeric catalysts showed enhancement of re-oxidation rates compared to the low molar mass analogue (I) due to the nonpolar field formed by the polymer ligand. Binding of ligands to macromolecules increases the steric hindrance towards substrate complexation at active sites. This can be decreased by binding the ligands via spacers to the macromolecule (as in III).",
