Energy needs and consumption impact world economies, global environmental concerns, and also the chemical industry. The discussion will focus on the components of the global energy supply by sector, the role of electricity as a key energy consumer, a need and means for practicing greater energy efficiency, and how all this provides multiple opportunities for catalysis, especially with regard to environmental concerns. Keywords Energy efficiency Process chemistry Electricity Global power needs CO2 1 Introduction Energy is vital for economic development and social progress [1]. In the USA, the cost of energy use amounted to $505 billion in 1993, which was 8% of the GDP [2]. Roland has commented that the environment is possibly the most important market force shaping the future of energy industries and markets. Energy policies of nations around the world will continue to be influenced by environmental issues which attract a great deal of attention, such as acid rain, smog, oil spills, handling of spent nuclear fuel, health and safety concerns associated with power generation (such as Three Mile Island), global warming and the ozone hole. It is obvious that reduction in energy via the application of more energy efficient processes and technologies will impact the cost of energy and the environment. More efficient energy production will reduce the emissions from power plants, which are major sources of environmental emissions to our atmosphere. (Electricity production is associated with the cogeneration of NO x , SO2, CO2, and particulates.) More efficient vehicles will reduce fuel demands. Unfortunately, market forces will also play a role since people are often unwilling to pay more money for fuel that is produced by greener and usually more expensive technologies. In addition, the higher capital cost and long lead time needed to install new technologies for the production of power and fuel become a barrier to the application of new energy producing technologies. Further, the lack of accurate information plays a very important role in setting policies and influencing governments, people, and industries. Without a clear understanding of the impact of a potential pollutant, it is hard to convince anyone to adopt alternative lifestyles or spend more money for alternative technologies. Below, it will become apparent that global energy production and demand and the environment are closely linked. Electricity is a key energy consumer and also figures predominantly in the operation of chemical and petroleum refining plants. This manuscript will show that energy, electricity production, the environment, regional economies, and catalysis are all inter-related. Progress in improving our environment will come with a focus and understanding of improved energy efficiencies of our chemical and refining industries, worldwide. 2 Energy and the environment 2.1 Energy sources around the world The global consumption of energy in 1996 came from these resources: oil, 33%; coal, 23%; and gas, 20%, with most of the balance coming from carbon-free sources such as hydroelectric, 6%; nuclear, 7%; and biomass, 12% [3]. It is important to appreciate that carbon-free sources of energy do not co-produce CO2, which has generated a lot of intense interest and concern with regard to the worldwide balance of CO2 in our atmosphere and global warming. Coal is not only a source of CO2 but also a significant source of sulfur. In terms of millions of metric tons (mmt) of carbon from coal, China has by far the greatest dependence on coal (682mmt), followed by the USA (524mmt), Russia (113mmt), and Germany (89mmt) [4]. When carbon fuels are used to produce H2, it is more advantageous to use lower carbon number fuels since the amount of H2 generated per atom of carbon is greatest with CH4. Each nation has unique factors which influence its production and consumption of energy. Nations with huge reserves of coal and little petroleum or natural gas are more likely to use coal as an energy source. Economic forces, politics, or severe environmental risk can press nations to accept alternative sources of energy. Energy demands and resources differ for small, large, developing and third world countries such as Australia, Japan, France, China, and the USA. Nations will generally prefer to use those internal natural resources which are widely available as opposed to importing fuel sources. If we look around the world [4], we note that, in China, coal makes up 75% of its total energy production. In Japan, petroleum is the major source of energy (55%). In Australia and New Zealand, 55% of their energy supply comes from coal and 39% from natural gas. In the USA, petroleum is the major source of energy while nuclear supplies only 22%. Looking at all of Western Europe in 1996, 21% of their energy supply came from natural gas, 26% from coal, and 53% from oil. These latter numbers are averages, and within Europe, there is a wide variation from one country to another. Natural gas use in Germany was 23%, in the UK, 10%, in Italy, 12%, and in France 10%. In France, nuclear power is the major source of energy supplying 70% of the energy for electricity generation. By the use of nuclear power, France claims to have reduced CO2 levels by 80%, NO x by 90%, and SO x by 80%. B. Young [5] recently summarized the situation in Australia as follows: 27% of the energy consumed is used for the production of electricity, 26% for transportation, 8% in meeting residential needs, and 26% in meeting manufacturing needs. Electricity generation is primarily produced from coal (83%) with only 9% being produced via hydroelectric sources. This is very much region-dependent; for example, in the state of New South Wales, 99.5% of the electricity is derived from coal. Australia has immense coal resources, so coal is relatively easy and cheap to mine. This heavy use of fossil fuel as a source of energy means that, by way of CO2 emissions, Australia contributes only 1.4% of the global total, but is number three on a per capita basis. The distribution of CO2 is as follows: 46% from stationary engines, 18% from agriculture, 14% from transportation, and 12% from forestry [5]. Young commented that, with regard to the Kyoto accords to reduce CO2 emissions around the world, Australia has great potential in doing so with its solar and wind resources, but the huge reserves of cheap, low sulfur coal make substitution for coal a limited and costly option. Instead, Australia will focus on other means to reduce CO2 emissions by reduced clearing of land, increased tree planting, increased use of renewable sources for electricity (hydroelectric), greater use of co-generation, increased energy efficiency (via updating old plants with more efficient motors, improved electrostatic precipitators, etc.), and emissions trading. In Japan, the supply of energy is distributed as follows: petroleum, 55%; coal, 16%; natural gas, 11%; and nuclear, 12% 1 Provided by Professor Hideshi Hattori through sources in the Japanese Government. 1 . The transportation industry is a large user of total energy at 25%, while the chemical and steel industries use 13 and 11%, respectively. Within the Japanese chemical industry, petroleum supplies 84% of the energy needs and electricity 11%. Electricity production in Japan comes from nuclear, 35%; natural gas, 22%; coal, 14%; and oil, 9%. Some sectors of the Japanese economy consume disproportionate amounts of energy, such as the transportation sector deriving 98% of its energy from petroleum. Fig. 1 illustrates how complex the source and end-use sectors for energy are in the USA. In 1994, the sources of energy in the US were distributed [6] mainly between petroleum (41%), natural gas (25%), and coal (23%). The consumption of energy is generally distributed between residential and commercial use (36%), industry (36%), and transportation (27%). In the industrial sector, energy was derived principally from natural gas (40%) and petroleum (36%) [7]. The transportation sector is the largest consumer of petroleum products in the USA [8], with automobiles accounting for 40% of US oil consumption. Beyond petroleum, natural gas, coal, hydroelectric, nuclear, solar, wind, biomass (methane from landfills), and geothermal offer some other sources for energy in the USA and around the world. On the other hand, the residential and commercial sectors relied principally on natural gas (47%) and electricity (38%). Much has been said about the tough environmental standards in the state of California; however, tough environmental laws have had an appreciable impact on the level of smog. In addition, California leads the world in carbon-free efficient energy generation. California’s focus on new power generation technologies reveals that it now has 40% of the world’s geothermal power plants, 30% of the installed windmill capacity, and 90% of the world’s solar energy generation [9]. In 1996, electricity generation showed a remarkable emphasis on non-fossil fuel sources (as contrasted with the rest of the USA): coal, 16%; hydroelectric, 25%; natural gas, 33%; and nuclear, 15% with another 11% from renewable resources (biomass, waste to energy, geothermal, small hydroelectric sources, solar, and wind). Interestingly, when one projects out over the next 20 years, oil will continue to remain the dominant source of energy around the world. In 1970, the global distribution was oil, 47%; natural gas, 17%; and coal, 29%. In 1995, this distribution was oil, 39%; natural gas, 21%; coal, 26%; nuclear, 6.3% and the balance as renewables (geothermal, waste to energy, solar, and wind). In 2015, worldwide energy sources are projected [10] to be oil (38%), natural gas (25%), coal (24%) and nuclear (4%) which mean only slight shifts versus the distribution in 1995. In assessing future energy needs and their impact upon the world’s economies and the environment, it should be appreciated that, in the 45-year period between 1970 and 2015, global energy usage in Europe and USA is forecast to drop to 47% from 66% in 1970, and for Asia, to rise abruptly from 9 to 28% of the world’s usage in the same time period [10]. Thus, the real, new growth in energy usage will come from the world’s rapidly developing nations, and this is where focus on the selection of future energy sources for these nations can have a big impact on energy demands, energy sources and emissions associated with energy production. The supply of energy is a fundamental requirement for development; unfortunately, developing nations often use and produce energy by very inefficient means. Further, the tendency for developing nations will be to grow rapidly without applying more highly energy efficient technologies because of the added cost or ease of doing so. Within the issue of energy usage are the topics of electricity generation, industrial emissions, and CO2 generation. 2.2 CO2 emissions and worldwide energy needs Much has been said about CO2 and global warming and it cannot go ignored when discussing energy efficiency. There is a great deal of vigorous debate on whether humans are responsible for increasing global temperatures. Some scientists argue that CO2 is not the result of any apparent global warming, rather water vapor [11] is a cause. Others argue that cyclic changes in the earth’s temperature is related to a history of solar magnetic cycles [12]. Some argue that, since 1979, the average temperature of the earth is actually decreasing, while CO2 levels appear to be rising, but predictions of global warming suggest just the opposite [13]. The earth’s climate is a very complex, non-linear, dynamic system. There is no dispute that CO2 levels have been increasing, although there may be dispute about the impact of CO2 levels upon any global warming. In trying to assess the impact of technology upon the environment, it is important to get good statistics. The CO2 topic is a clear example of this. It is estimated that 168,000mmt per year of CO2 are generated globally [14]. Huge quantities come from natural sources (oceans, 100,000mmt per year; aerobic decay of vegetation, 30,000mmt per year; and plant and animal respiration, 30,000mmt per year). Of the 168,000mmt per year, it is estimated that 160,000mmt per year come from natural sources and only 8000mmt per year from human derived sources. Fortunately, the earth has a huge capacity for absorbing a great deal of the CO2 via its oceans. There are huge volumes of CO2 transferred between the surface of the ocean and the atmosphere, between vegetation and the atmosphere, and between marine biota and the ocean [15]. It is estimated that the net global increase in CO2 amounts to 3400mmt per year, but it is important to remember that this is the difference between two very large numbers. It is also estimated that, in 1990, 1375mmt per year of CO2 were derived from the production of energy in the USA [14]. This is only 1.4% of the global CO2 emissions, but this number generates a great deal of press. Thus, any focus on reducing CO2 emissions for reasons of global warming must be approved with some caution. Reducing CO2 would certainly be desirable from the standpoint of reducing the use of fossil fuels. Large scale removal of CO2 is impacted by the huge and broad production of CO2 around the world and what we can do with it (it is not very chemically reactive). The potential for the production of chemicals is small in volume [16]. Purity and pressure needs put limitations on the value of CO2. The use of H2 [17] as a means of reducing CO2 to CO or methanol demands a cheap source of H2 from non-fossil fuel sources. Although carbon management (via CO2 injection into oceans or coal beds; absorption with amine solvents; or injections into acquifers under the North Sea) is the focus of the means to reduce CO2 levels in the short term, longer term improvements in the supply of energy and reducing the demand for energy will have a potentially greater impact on CO2 emissions. It has been suggested [18] that a massive transition to carbon-free power supply is needed, especially in developing nations along with a massive global R&D effort in innovative energy research. Again, a big opportunity for controlling CO2 emissions lies in seeking greater energy efficiency in power production, chemical processing, automobile production and operation, etc. 3 Energy and electricity What is often not appreciated is the significance of electricity generation and its usage as a key part of the global energy picture. It is often forgotten that electricity is a significant source of energy in the USA and around the world, and it usually comes from some other carbon based fuel source. Within the USA and many major nations, electric utilities consume >33% of the total energy produced. Primary sources of fuel for electricity generation are petroleum, natural gas, coal, and nuclear. However, in the USA, coal has been the primary source of electricity generation (55% in 1994) with nuclear being a distant second at 22%. Hydroelectric and natural gas provided 13 and 10%, respectively, of the means for electricity generation [19]. Since 1970, coal has climbed slightly, while petroleum and natural gas have remained somewhat flat as sources of electricity generation. It is also important to remember that, while coal is a major source of electricity in the USA, electricity is not the primary source of energy in the USA, rather it is petroleum. These numbers differ dramatically in other countries such as France and Australia. The environmental downside of electricity generation is evident with the co-production of environmentally unacceptable emissions: NO x , SO2, CO2, and particulates. 3.1 Distribution of energy in US industry In the American industry, one can see from Fig. 2 that chemicals and petroleum refining accounted for about 50% of the total energy needs of industry, with forest products being a distant third [20]. A 1994 DOE report [21] indicated that petroleum refining consumed 29% of the total energy use in the USA, or 6263 quadrillion BTUs. Within the chemicals industry, the production of organic chemicals accounted for 45% of the total energy needs of this industrial sector. The other components of the chemicals industry were plastics, 12%; fertilizers, 12%; inorganic chemicals, 7%; and cyclic crudes and intermediates, 4%; rubber, chlorine, fiber, and gases production accounted for less than 1% each. American industry uses heat, power, and electricity for the generation of large quantities of steam, with two-thirds of industrial fuel being used to generate steam. With the generation of this steam comes the release of large amounts of CO2 which accounts for 40% of US industrial CO2 emissions [22]. It is estimated that 50% of the total energy consumed by the chemicals industry and 30% of the total energy consumed by the petroleum industry in the US is used to produce this vital steam. 4 The role for greater energy efficiency In considering opportunities for greater energy efficiency, one must look at the total flow of energy into and out of a process. This type of energy balance examines the use of fuel, electricity, utilities (water, steam, coolant, air, etc.) used in a process and includes loses associated with co- or by-products, waste streams, including waste heat, and considers the energy value of the feedstocks as well. This is illustrated in Fig. 3 by capturing different views of a process. In a multi-step process, such as the production of nitrobenzene, one can take the very narrow picture and look only at the nitration of benzene. Actually, this is a multi-step process which demands the production of NH3 from N2, the production of H2 by steam reforming hydrocarbons, and the oxidation of NH3 to HNO3 as well (what one can envision as the limit of system #1 in Fig. 3). One needs also to appreciate that the production of a material like nitrobenzene also entails a great deal of heat and electricity input which must come from a power plant, hence the designation of the limit of system #2 in Fig. 3. The chemical process is much bigger than this; however, if one also considers the generation of the fuel provided to the power plant, the power station that meters the electricity generation, the type of feedstock and its ultimate trail of energy input, the dissipation of the waste heat from a variety of sources, the handling and disposal of by-products, the purification of feedstocks and/or the separation of products, and finally, the impact of all these components upon the environment (via emissions, waste disposal costs, etc.). The latter global system is designated as the boundary of the process system #3 in Fig. 3. It is estimated [23] that 13% of the chemical industry’s energy usage comes from distillation requirements and another 10% from drying operations. Additional power is needed for providing refrigeration, compression, recirculation, or separations. The point is that one cannot look at one step in a multi-step production process and ignore the impact of other inputs to that step in the final production of the chemical one seeks to sell or use. If one also takes a total picture of a process by way of CO2 production, one begins to count the components often ignored, such as the production of CO2 by the use of natural gas fired burners, dryers, etc. While co-generation is a desirable by-way of energy efficiency, it also is a source of CO2 emissions since fossil fuels are often used to generate the steam. Similarly, the electricity which powers the batteries of electric vehicles means that these vehicles ultimately generate CO2. Hedman et al. [24] have done a massive amount of energy balance studies for 108 processes. Energy analyses should be done on all processes, not just those having carbon in the product, because the energy input for processes ultimately comes from carbon based fuels. Examples of highly energy inefficient operations include the following: lime kiln operations, only 29% energy efficient; the production of aluminum; the production of paper via the Kraft process; and the production of cement. One needs to look at all the stages of a process to quantify these inefficiencies. In the lime kiln operation, the kiln, drier, and evaporators account for >70% of the energy loss in the process; more than 21% of the energy is lost as waste heat from the furnaces. One can seek greater energy efficiency via the application of new technologies (motors, heat pumps, co-generation, etc.), the reduction of heat and power consumption, and more energy efficient chemical and refining operations. Simple solutions can be applied by reducing leaks, greater use of insulation, minimizing the use of pressure, and avoiding over-drying. For many processes, changes in the overall process design can offer the greatest potential for reducing energy efficiency by reducing the pressure or temperature of a process step or improving the one pass conversion. The latter topical areas offer a great opportunity for catalysis. As another example of areas for improving energy efficiency in chemical processing operations, consider the production of nitric acid. Methane is used to produce H2, which is a very endoergic operation. H2 is reacted with N2 to produce NH3, another endoergic operation. NH3 is oxidized to NO x and then NO x is reacted with air to produce nitric acid. For the synthesis of NH3, 55% of the process work is preserved in the formation of liquid NH3. In the synthesis of nitric acid, 16% of the total energy used is tied up in combustion and absorption/oxidation [25]. There is a great deal of interest in supercritical CO2 as a solvent for a number of processes. This is a cleaner solvent and may be advantageous over the use of VOC undesirable alternatives, but again, one must consider the total energy cost. The use of CO2 is tied to recovering and recycling the CO2, which has an energy cost associated with these operations. In addition, energy for compression of the CO2 and for moving the CO2 around the process via the power used to operate high pressure pumps must be considered, especially when one recalls that the generation of electrical energy is not always a carbon-free operation. It is apparent that increased energy efficiency offers a reasonable and immediate approach for making significant reductions in CO2 emissions; while this cannot meet the Kyoto accord levels, it can go a long way to help. In addition, we need to employ more operations using established energy efficient technologies, such as co-generation. Finally where possible and sensible, we should be moving away from coal and oil and more towards natural gas for energy supply. The latter may make some countries less competitive; hence, they will be less interested in taking this important step. Also, for those nations with ample reserves of coal, there may be a considerable, negative economic impact for switching away from coal for industries which rely on using coal within those nations [26]. 4.1 Energy balance in refineries Within a petrochemical refinery, most of the process units consume large quantities of energy, and a refinery employs a great deal of energy balance across multiple operating units, often by burning low grade products as fuel to provide a cheap source of energy. The utility needs for a refinery are complex and enormous. For a 200,000 barrel per day light crude refinery [27], the electric power needs are estimated to be ∼7 billion BTU per day; the steam requirements amount to 35 million per day; cooling water needs approach 46 milliongal per day; and fuel demands amount to 97 billion BTU per day. Refineries entail high cost and huge operations, but are highly efficient. This means that there is not much room for energy efficiency improvement without often paying more for it at the pump! One needs to also consider that there were ∼708 refineries around the world prior to 1995 [28], with 198 in the USA/Canada, 137 in the Asia/Pacific Rim, and 115 in Western Europe. However, it must be appreciated that the construction of new refineries is low in these existing refinery intensive regions (in January 1995, none in USA or Latin America, and only two in Western Europe). However, in January 1995, there were 31 refineries under construction in the Asia/Pacific Rim, eight in Eastern Europe, and five in the Middle East and Africa. Given the large amounts of emissions and the energy consumption by a refinery, one sees that future growth of these energy and emissions intensive operations is emerging in the third world nations around the globe. Building energy efficiencies into new construction is easier and more cost effective than trying to rebuild an older operation; therefore, a big, potential impact on efforts to improve energy efficiency in the refinery sector of the world will come not from the US or Western Europe but from the emerging nations. 4.2 Natural gas is only a temporary solution The interest in substituting natural gas for oil can only be considered a temporary and partial solution to energy and carbon efficiency. Substituting natural gas for oil only impacts ∼2% of the CO2 emissions [29], although substituting natural gas for coal impacts 22% of CO2 emissions; one must remember that natural gas is still a fossil fuel! Suggestions to use methane decomposition to produce H2 and carbon as an alternative to the energy intensive steam reforming process for making H2 must still deal with collection, separation, and removal of the solid carbon, as well as deactivation of the expensive catalyst [17]. These are all energy intensive operations that cannot be ignored by looking at just one equation. 5 Opportunities for catalysis Catalysis can be used to implement many of the key parts of the USA’s Department of Energy Comprehensive National Energy Strategy [30] via its historical and future impact on providing increased energy efficiency, higher fuel economy (lean burn engines), increased production of chemicals from natural gas, improved efficiency for the use of petroleum based feedstocks in chemical processes, lower emissions in petroleum refineries, and reduced emissions of gases contributing to global warming. Catalysts will make it possible to shift to a greater use of natural gas as a chemicals’ feedstock, as a better means to produce H2 as a future fuel, towards the development of cheaper and more efficient fuel cells, and towards the development of solar cells for the production of chemicals, such as H2. Biomass is clearly an attractive alternative to the standard fossil fuels now used for the production of chemicals. Catalysts can help here by facilitating the hydrolysis of cellulose, the conversion of lignin to aromatic carboxylic acids, the selective hydrogenation and deoxygenation of cellulose, and the selective functionalization of carbohydrates. Catalysts will be needed to depolymerize a variety of mixed polymers for recycling and waste minimization efforts. However, from a total energy standpoint, it is important to understand that, in pursuing catalysts for all these operations, the alternative catalyst or process must be more energy efficient than the existing approaches. 6 Conclusion Energy, CO2, the environment, regional economies, electricity, and catalysis are all inter-related. One cannot assume that electricity is free or clean (green). The development of new process alternatives will depend on the total energy and the type of energy used in new technology. Do not look at just selectivity improvements, but at all the energy consuming steps in any improved technology. Increased energy efficiency offers a reasonable and immediate approach for making significant reductions in CO2 emissions. In understanding and focusing our efforts, we need better data and numbers to understand the impact of compounds such as CO2 upon our environment. Where possible and sensible, nations need to move away from coal and oil to natural gas and eventually to focus on non-fossil fuel sources of energy. The petroleum refineries and the chemical industry are major consumers of power around the world. Catalysts offer a great deal of hope and also opportunity for providing greater global energy efficiency (via new processes and alternative feedstocks). Catalysis can play a significant role in reducing power and energy requirements via lowering operating temperatures, reducing pressure, and improving reaction selectivity and one pass yields. Both chemical and refinery industries are major energy consumers, but greater energy efficiency via the application of new catalyst technology can contribute to a greener environment [31]. Here, there are enough ways that catalysis can be used to implement greater energy and carbon efficiency.
