Ie Europa l, 34127 Trieste (Italy) ALESSANDRO TROVARELLI and GIULIANO DOLCETTI Istituto di Chimica, Facolta di Ingegneria, Universita di Udine, 33100 Udine (Italy) Summary Homogeneous and heterogenized carbonyl metal clusters of Groups 8 and 9 have been employed as catalyst precursors for the isomerization of 1,5-cyclooctadiene (1,5-COD) to the 1,4- and 1,3-isomers with the aim of obtaining high yields of the intermediate product (1,4-COD). The most active isomerization catalysts found are the ruthenium-based heterogenized cata- lysts, while with the analogous iridium catalysts a yield of 1,4-COD as high as 65% is obtained. Characterization of the iridium catalyst by IR spec- troscopy is reported. Introduction The use of molecular clusters as precursors for supported catalysts has received considerable attention in the past [1]. Much effort was directed to the synthesis of heterogeneous catalysts containing 'tailored' metal particles [2,3], but considerable interest was also focused on the preparation of supported molecular species anchored to a variety of supports. The species were thoroughly characterized [la, 4] and used in a number of catalytic reactions, including CO hydrogenation [Ib, 5, 6], olefin hydrogenation [7] and isomerization [le, 8, 9]. Recently, heterogenized catalysts derived from Os3(CO)i2 have also been employed in the hydrogen-transfer reduction of ketones [ 10] and in the water-gas shift reaction [11]. In spite of a large number of studies on the applications of supported metal clusters as catalysts, no unusual selectivities or activities were apparently described [Id, 4]. However, there is some evi- dence that in a number of cases, such as olefin isomerization, these catalysts could be more promising than the classical heterogeneous ones, since activi- ties comparable with those of homogeneous catalysts were found [12]. Since 1,4-COD was claimed to be a potentially useful starting material in some metathesis reactions [13], we have investigated the isomerization of 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 230 1,5-cyclooctadiene (1,5-COD) to 1,4-COD and 1,3-COD catalyzed by carbonyl clusters of ruthenium and osmium [14]. We have shown that a catalyst more active and selective towards the formation of 1,4-COD than its homogeneous counterpart was obtained by heterogenizing Ru3(CO)ia on silica. We have extended our investigation to other Group 9 metal compounds, namely Rhg(CO)ig and ir^(CO)^. The kinetics of the reaction are reported and the nature of the iridium catalyst has been investigated by IR spectroscopy. Experimental The Os3(CO)i2, Ru3(CO)i2, L^CO)^ and Rhe(CO)ig clusters were pur- chased from Strem Chemicals and used as received. Solvents (Carlo Erba) were distilled and stored under a nitrogen atmosphere over 5 A molecular sieves. 1,5-Cyclo-octadiene (EGA Chemie) was passed through a silica gel column [15] and stored under nitrogen over 5 A molecular sieves. A fully hydrated highly porous silica (Grace type 121, 30 - 50 mesh, BET surface area 700 m2 g~1) was used as support. The syntheses of the osmium- and ruthenium-supported catalysts were performed using the method described elsewhere [14]. The impregnated (see discussion section) rhodium (IR:v(CO) 2076, 2067, 2052, 2041, 2025, 2018, 1995, 1795cm-1) and iridium (IR:v(CO) 2073, 2059, 2043, 2019, 2003, 1996cm-1) carbonyls were prepared by impregnation of the support in an n-heptane solution of the cluster. A typical procedure is reported: 72 mg (6.5 x 10~6 mol) of Ir4(CO)i2 were dissolved in n-heptane (150 ml) by refluxing the solution for several hours. When the cluster was completely dissolved, silica (5 g) was introduced and the solvent slowly evaporated under vacuum. The compound was then dried in vacua for 2 h. A metal loading of 0.88 wt.% and 0.60 wt.% were obtained for iridium and rhodium respectively, as measured by X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Physisorbed h^COWSiOg (IR: v(CO) 2068, 2028, 1995cm-1) was pre- pared by thermal treatment (100 C, 3h in air, CO or N3) of the above described impregnated species. No detectable loss of metal carbonyl occurred during this treatment as measured by XRF. The loading of iridium and rhodium in the heterogenized clusters was determined by X-ray fluorescence using a Philips PW 1404 spectrometer. Standards were prepared by dry grinding appropriate amounts of Ir4(CO)i2 and Rhg (CO)ig with silica. The percentage of metal in the standards was in the range 0.3 -1.5%. The infrared spectra were recorded as Nujol mulls on a Perkin-Elmer 983 spectrometer (nominal resolution 2cm-1) equipped with a Perkin-Elmer 3600 data station. All the reactions were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere unless otherwise specified. A typical batch experiment was carried out as follows: 0.25 ml of 1,5-COD (3.45 x 10-3 mol) were added to 15 ml of a stirred n-octane solution or suspension of the catalyst at the appropriate reaction tempera- ture. The reaction mixture was periodically analyzed by GLC using a Varian 231 1400 instrument equipped with a flame ionization detector. Separation of the products was achieved on a 30 m length x 0.52 mm i.d. Supelcowax 10 wide- bore capillary column at 60 C. The products were identified by comparison with authentic samples or by GLC-mass spectrometry. The heterogenized catalysts were recycled by filtering off the solid which was then washed with n-octane and dried in vacua before further use. The catalytic experiments were carried out under flow conditions in a conventional tubular (10cm length x 4.4 mm ID) stainless-steel flow reactor interfaced to a GLC system. 1,5-COD was vaporized into the stream of carrier gas (argon) by means of a thermostatted saturator. Results and Discussion Synthesis and characterization of heterogenized catalyst precursors In this work, chemi- or physisorbed catalysts were prepared by refluxing a hydrocarbon solution of the cluster in the presence of the support accord- ing to a previously described procedure [16]. This procedure has the following advantages: (i) only relatively strongly bound species will form on the silica surface, because of constant partitioning with the solvent; and (ii) a better dispersion is obtained, thus avoiding formation of adsorbed crystallites which are sometimes observed when the clusters are deposited on silica [17]. Thus, using an n-octane solution ofOs3(CO)i2, the chemisorbed [Osg(^-H)(CO)io(/i- 0 Si<)] is formed on the surface. Refluxing an n-hexane solution of Ru3(CO)i2 in the presence of the high surface area silica employed also led to a physisorbed species [14] (IR: v(CO) 2064, 2030, 2018 cm-1 [18]). Conversely, if n-heptane is employed, the surface-grafted cluster [Rug(/z-H)(CO)io(^- 0 Si<] (IR: v(CO) 2110, 2077, 2065, 2027, 1995 cm-1) [19] is readily obtained. Since both the chemi- and physi-sorbed ruthenium clusters easily oxidize in air, the catalytic activity of the oxidized >Ru (CO)2 species (IR: v(CO) 2061, 1999cm-1) [20] was also investigated (run 9, Table 1). As far as the preparation of the rhodium and iridium catalysts is concerned, a different situation was observed: both the clusters Rhg(CO)i6 and Ir4(CO)i2 are sparingly soluble in hydrocarbon solvents, hence diluted solutions have to be used and only limited adsorption was observed. Longer reaction times are required to enhance the adsorption leading to partial decarbonylation of the supported species. We have therefore deposited these two clusters by slow evaporation of the solvent (see experimental section). In this way, large crystallites formed on the surface as confirmed by the IR spectra of the supported species, which are almost superimposable with those of the pure Rhg(CO)i6 and h^CO)^ (compare spectra (B) and (D) and (A) and (C) in Fig. 1), and by SEM and XRD techniques [21]. It is interesting to compare the IR spectrum of ^(CCOiz/SiOa [Fig. 1, spectrum (C)] with the results of the characterization of supported Ir4(CO)i2 previously reported by Howe et al. [22]. In the latter case, the spectrum showed only an intense negative adsorption at about 2130cm-! associated with the Christiansen TABLE 1 Isomerization of 1,5-cyclooctadiene catalyzed by Groups 8 and 9 metal carbonyls\" t0e Run Catalyst No. [1,5-COD] Time (h) 1,5-COD (mol %) 1,4-COD (mol %) 1,3-COD(mol %) Turnover number (TN)1' Selectivity\" [M,(CO)y] 1 Ir4(CO)i, 2 Ir,i(CO)i2/SiO;i 3 Rh^CO),,,'1 4 Rh<,(CO) ,/SiO,5 Os3(CO)i2-6 Os-G/SiO;^ 7 Ru3(CO)i2-8 Ru3(CO)i;i/Si02'' 9 Ru^CO^/SiO;;\" 260 295 210 350200 200 200 200 200 0.5 2 8 0.5 2 8 2 5 8 0.5 2 5 8 8 21 8 21 0.5 8 0.08 0.5 0.5 1 97 68 22 89 40 2 91 82 79 87 77 60 60 50 7 60 4 50 9 45 5 28 9 3 20 24 9 40 10 4 5 6 5 8 13 13 8 3 12 5 23 5 21 10 25 16 traces 12 34 1 19 82 5 13 16 8 14 27 27 42 90 28 91 27 86 34 85 48 75 117 315 43 2135 3 90 500 120 62 41 88 68 12 44 29 26 40 37 33 33 16 3 30 5 46 5 38 11 34 18 'Reaction conditions: solvent, n-octane (15 ml); 1,5-COD (3.45 x 10-' mol); 1 g of heterogenized catalysts (metal loading: Ir, 0.88 wt.% Rh, 0.60 wt.%) was used except for the ruthenium ones (0.5 g); reaction temperature 125 C. *TN = (mol 1,5-COD (converted) x (mol metal\"1) x h-1 calculated at a conversion of 20%. \"Selectivity: 100 x [1,4-COD]/[1,4-COD] + [1,3-COD]).

Since different types of silica were used (the BET surface area in our case was about twice that of Howe et al. [22]), crystallites of different sizes are probably formed, accounting for the different spectra observed. Since large IT^(CO)^ crystallites are formed on the silica surface, weak interactions with the support are expected. As in fact, our sample showed extensive leaching of the iridium cluster when used as a catalyst under batch conditions. Supported metal carbonyl clusters show a high surface mobility 234 [24] which can lead to redistribution on the support upon thermal treatment [3b]. We have therefore thermally treated the above iridium catalyst at 100 C in N3, CO or air (h^CO^g/SiOz decarbonylates above 150 C [22]). A redistri- bution of Ir4(CO)i2 on the surface was observed [21] and the IR spectrum features bands in the v(CO) region at 2068, 2028 and 1995cm-1 [Fig. 1, spectrum (E)]. By comparison with the IR spectrum of Ir4(CO)i2 in solution (v(CO) 2071, 2032 cm-1 [25]), and bearing in mind that an additional band at 2002cm-1 is observed in the solid-state spectrum of Ir4(CO)i2 [Fig. 1, spec- trum (C)], we may conclude that a physically adsorbed species forms on silica and that it is rather similar to that observed on alumina [3b, 22, 26]. Physisorbed Rhg(CO)ie decarbonylates under vacuum even at room temperature; at higher temperatures the process occurs more readily and produces metallic particles [24]. Hence no thermal treatment was performed on the rhodium species. Catalytic reactions In Table 1 we report the results obtained in the catalytic isomerization of 1,5-COD to the 1,4- and 1,3-isomers using carbonyl clusters of iridium, rhodium, osmium and ruthenium both under homogeneous conditions or heterogenized on silica. The ability of carbonyl metal clusters of Groups 8 and 9 to catalyze the isomerization of olefins in the homogeneous phase is well documented [27 - 29]. Consistently, all the clusters employed catalyze the isomerization of 1,5,-COD, even if to different extents (Table 1). The catalytic activity of Os3(CO)i2 (run 5, Table 1) is noticeably lower than that of the other metal carbonyls [28, 29], while h^CO)^ and Ru3(CO)i2 show a comparable activity under our reaction conditions (runs 1, 7, Table 1). Ru3(CO)i2, however, deactivated during the course of the reaction due to the formation of tri- and tetra-nuclear ruthenium derivatives containing coordinated 1,5-COD [14, 30]. Catalyst deactivation is also observed when Rh6(CO)ig is used as a precursor (run 3, Table 1). A conversion of 18% is obtained after 5 h reaction, which increases only by 3% after reaction for three further hours. At the same time a black material, presumably rhodium metal, separates from the reaction mixture. Rhg(CO)i8 was employed as a catalyst precursor in the hydrogen- transfer reduction of 1,5-COD, and it was shown that the presence of CO was necessary to avoid catalyst decomposition [31]. No deactivation was observed with iridium and osmium clusters, probably because of the higher stabilities of these two compounds compared to those of rhodium and ruthenium [32]. Upon heterogenizing the clusters on silica, more active catalysts than the homogeneous 'analogues' are generally obtained (Table 1, compare runs 1, 3, 7 and 2, 4, 8, respectively). This behaviour was attributed to the presence of surface OH groups which gave rise to the formation of hydrido carbonyl species [14], which are known, at least in the case of ruthenium [33], to be better catalysts for the isomerization of olefins than the carbonyl clusters themselves. Thus, an increase in turnover number from 90 to 500 is observed (runs 7, 8, Table 1) upon heterogenizing Ru3(CO)i2, and the catalyst obtained 235 is the most active among those tested. However, it decomposes in air [14,18,19] and therefore oxidized >RuII(CO)2 carbonyl [20] was also employed as a catalyst (run 9, Table 1). This species shows good activity and almost the same selectivity as physisorbed Ru3 ( C0)i2 ; it also has the advantage of easy recycling without a great loss in catalytic activity [14]. As far as selectivity is concerned, the iridium heterogenized catalyst appeared to be the most promising since yields of up to 40% in 1,4-COD could be obtained (run 2, Table 1). A kinetic study of the isomerization reaction was therefore undertaken, and the results are reported in Table 2. The kinetic constants reported in the table refer to a hypothetical system of consecutive reversible first-order reactions: -0-0 Scheme 1.

A reasonable value for the kinetic constants was obtained by reducing the solving of differential eqns. (1) - (3), and fitting the solutions obtained, to a problem of linear least-square regression using the method of numerical quadrature as fully described by Gay [34] and Himmelbau et al. [35]. As shown in Fig. 2, which describes a typical batch experiment, the calculated values, which are represented by the solid lines*, fit fairly well with the experimental points. This result confirms that the reaction proceeds via a kinetically con- trolled two-step isomerization with 1,4-COD as the intermediate product [14, 37]. However, this kinetic model apparently does not account for all the experimental data reported in Table 2, since a meaningless negative k^ value was calculated for run 1. Since the k values (Scheme 1) include the catalyst concentration, the Ag value could be related to a catalyst modification during the reaction. To check this point, we carried out a separate experiment in a flow reactor (see experimental section). At 120 C using a time factor of 0.02 [gcataiyst mln (m^ gas)\"1], the physisorbed iridium compound initially showed only a negligible activity which slowly increased with time to reach a constant value after 8 h. During the course of the reaction catalyst decar- bonylation occurred, as is demonstrated by the IR spectrum of the sample *The composition of the reaction mixture versus time was calculated by introducing the experimental kinetic constants reported in Table 2 into the exact solutions of differential eqns.

Notably, when this sample was treated at 120 C in flowing CO for 7 h, the physisorbed Ir4(CO)i2 was partially restored [Fig. 1, spectrum (G); v(CO) 2068, 2029, 1995 cm\"1]. The intensity of these bands is lower than that of the starting material [Fig. 1, spectrum (E)], but it should also be noted that some leaching of metal occurred during the catalytic tests. The metal loss, however, was only significant during the first run where the metal loading dropped from an initial value of 0.88 wt.% (run 1, Table 2) to a value of 0.76 wt.%. Further recycles had little effect on the metal content. Indeed, when the catalyst was time (h) time (h) Fig. 3. Isomerization of 1,5-cyclooctadiene catalyzed by Ir4(CO)i2/Si02. Effect of catalyst recycle and pretreatment. (1) Plot of percentage 1,4-COD versus time. (2) Plot of percentage conversion versus time. In both plots (a) run 1, Table 2; (b) run 4, Table 2 and (c) run 6, Table 2. (Solid lines refer to the calculated values using the kinetic constants reported in Table 2, except for curves (a) (see text), while the points refer to the experimental values.) 238 recycled four times (run 5, Table 2), a final metal loading of 0.72 wt.% was measured by X-ray fluoroescence. ^4(00)12 reacts in refluxing chlorobenzene with 1,5-COD to give Ir4(CO)5(C8Hi2)2(C8Hio) [38], and this gives rise to the following question: is the 1,5-COD involved in the catalyst activation and does this account for the induction period observed? In order to answer this point, a sample of Ir4(CO)i2 physisorbed on SiOg was refluxed for 8 h in n-octane before the substrate was added (run 6, Table 2). Figure 3, plots (1) and (2), curves (c), shows that the reaction profile and yield in 1,4-COD differ from those observed using both the fresh catalyst [Fig. 3, curves (a)] and the recycled one [Fig. 3, curves (b)]. This result seems to indicate that 1,5-COD coordina- tion is required to obtain the catalytic species. The recycled catalyst defin- itely showed a higher selectivity towards 1,4-isomer formation, and a maximum yield of ca. GO - 65% was obtained in the various experiments performed (runs 2 - 5, Table 2). To the best of our knowledge, this result represents one of the best methods for obtaining 1,4-cyclooctadiene by isomer- ization of 1,5-cyclooctadiene [13,15]. To check whether traces of metal could be responsible for the observed catalytic activity, two different samples (runs 7, 8, Table 2) of supported metal were prepared [39]. The resulting catalytic activity was far lower than that ofh-^CO^/SiOa (compare &i values in runs 7, 8 and 2 - 5, Table 2), suggesting that metal particles are not involved in the catalytic cycle. Conclusions In this work the activity of homogeneous and heterogeneous 'analogue' catalysts have been compared. Highly active catalysts for the isomerization of olefins have been obtained by heterogenizing ruthenium carbonyl clusters. An active ir^(CO)^ heterogenized catalyst which is highly selective towards 1,4-COD formation was synthesized and characterized. Acknowledgements The authors thank Prof. S.
