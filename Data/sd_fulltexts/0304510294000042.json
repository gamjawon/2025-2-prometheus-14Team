Heyrovsky Institute of Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Dolej kova 3, 182 23 Prague 8, Czech Republic Abstract Activity of WC16, WCIs(OAr) and WOC14 as unicomponent catalysts was studied in metathesis of unsaturated esters. WC16 and WCIs(OAr), where Ar=p-chlorophenyl and p-t-butylphenyl were found to be active in ring opening metathesis of 5-norbomene-2-yl acetate (NBEAc) and in copolymerization of NBEAc with dicyclopentadiene (DCPD). Completely soluble copolymers were prepared in the latter case and copolymerization parameters r, = rZ =1 were found. Cometathesis of DCPD with methyl undecenoate and dimethyl 3-hexenedioate leads to the formation of low molecular weight polymer and/or oligomers containing 1 or 2 ester groups in the molecule. Effects of ester groups on catalytic activity of WC16 in DCPD polymerization was studied using definite additions of methyl palmitate (MP). With increasing amounts of MP, reduction of polymerization rate and, significantly, growth of the non-crosslinked polymer fraction occur. Although hydrocarbons with highly strained norbornene ring are necessary for the formation of catalytic active centres, catalytic activity of centres already formed is not restricted on the substrates with such a ring. However, their reactivity depends on the ring strain considerably and this substrate selectivity still increases in the presence of esters.

Introduction It has been shown earlier that ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) can be initiated by high valent tungsten chlorides WC16, WC15 (OAr) and WOC14 without any cocatalyst [ 1-3]. It seems that the role of cocatalyst *Corresponding author; fax. ( +42-2)8582307. 0304-5102/94/$07.00 1994 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved SSDI0304-5102(94)00004-F 136 H. Balcar, L. Petrusovd /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 90 (1994) 135-141 is played by the substrate itself and this ability of substrate is connected with its highly strained norbornene ring. In comparison with widely used systems containing EtXAlC13 _x (x= 1, 2, 3) as cocatalysts, unicomponent catalysts are less reactive but more selective: the norbornene ring is opened predominantly and non-crosslinked polymer with preserved cyclopentene rings prevails in reaction products at room temperature [ 3 ] . It is well known that the presence of polar groups in substrate molecules reduces significantly the catalytic activity of all tungsten catalysts. Therefore, we have tried to establish the catalytic activity of the above mentioned unicomponent catalysts in the presence of carboxylic acid esters. Following esters of three types have been used. Methyl palmitate, which does not undergo metathesis but can interact with the catalyst, 5-norbomene-2-yl acetate (NBEAc), containing both the norbornene ring and the ester group and two linear unsaturated esters (methyl undecenoate and dimethyl 3-hexenedioate). 2. Experimental 2.1. Chemicals DCPD, produced by Chemical Plants in Litvfnov, Czech Rep., was stripped by nitrogen and degassed in vacuo. NBEAc (Janssen Chimica), 98% purity, 80% of endo-isomer was distilled in vacuo. Its acidity number was 0.9. Methyl undecenoate was prepared by conventional esterification of acid and distilled in vacuo. Acidity number was 0.1. Dimethyl 3hexenedioate was prepared by esterification according to the literature [ 4 ] . Methyl palmitate (Fluka), puriss., was used without any purification. WC16 (Fluka) was purified by sublimation in vacuo, WOC14 was prepared by reaction of WC16 with t-butanol [5] and WC15(OAr) were prepared by reaction of WC16 with phenols [3]. Benzene was dried by NaH, distilled and degassed in vacuo. 2.2. Procedures and product characterization All operations were carried out in vacuo using all-glass apparatus equipped with breakable seals. Benzene was used as a solvent. Polymers were isolated by precipitation in methanol (with antioxidant) and dried in vacuo at 40 C. The separation of non-crosslinked polymer fraction was done by extracting the polymer in benzene at laboratory temperature during 24 h. Concentrations of monomers in the reaction mixture were determined by GC (Dexsil 400 on Chromaton, temperature program 80-300 C) . IR spectra of polymers (in KBr pellets or in benzene solutions) were recorded on Specord 75 IR. Molecular weights were determined by GPC using polystyrene standards. 3. Results and discussion Table 1 shows the results of experiments with methyl palmitate added to WC16 before starting DCPD polymerization. In contrast to the system without ester, where a dark precipitate is always formed, the reaction mixture remains homogeneous. With increasing H. Balcar, G.

IR spectra of both soluble and insoluble polymer fractions are similar and resemble spectra of polymers prepared in the absence of ester (Fig. 1 a - band assignment is given elsewhere [ 3 ] ) Although WOC14 is probably the main product in the reaction of WCIb with methyl palmitate [ 6 ] , WOC14 alone cannot be responsible for the observed reduction of catalyst activity and for increased selectivity (see No. 5 ), but the coordination of ester to the catalytic active species and/or to their precursor may be taken into account. Results of NBEAc polymerization by unicomponent catalysts are given in the Table 2. It is seen that the catalytic activity decreases in the series WCIb > WC15 (O-4-t-BuC6H4) > WC15 (O-4-Cl-C6H4). WOC14 completely fails. The IR spectrum of polymers prepared is shown in Fig. lb. The presence of the bonds corresponding to the double bonds along the main chain (973, 755 and 1408 cm-') indicates that ROMP occurred (Eq. 1). The data show that relatively high concentrations of both the catalyst and the ester are needed for appearance of catalytic activity (cf. Nos. 2-4, Table 2). n - (1l OCOMe 1ocome I n Using WC16 as unicomponent catalyst non-crosslinked copolymers of DCPD with NBEAc were prepared according to Eq. 2 (reaction condition as those in the Table 1, yield about 50% in 2.5 h).

For interpretation of the main band see [ 3 ] . to [ 7 ] ) yielded a product insoluble in benzene and only partially soluble in tetrahydrofuran, the IR spectrum of which indicates complete hydrolysis of acetate groups. Moderate polymerization rate and solubility of copolymers allowed us to construct the copolymerization diagram for this system of monomers (Fig. 2). Copolymerization parameters found, rt =r2= 1, are in accordance with our previous conclusions [8] that in ROMP, the rate of monomer incorporation does not depend on substituents of cycloalkene rings. Formation of completely soluble copolymers of DCPD with NBEAc seems to be a specific feature of unicomponent catalyst. It is known that catalytic systems with Et2A1C1 provide crosslinked copolymers in similar cases [9] and another commonly used catalyst system WC16 + Me4Sn gave us only partially soluble products, too (reaction conditions: molar ratio W/Sn/NBEAc/DCPD=1/4/68/74, cW -17 mmol/1, T= 70'C, conversion=O% after 15 min).

Results of DCPD cometathesis with linear unsaturated esters, methyl undecenoate (MU) and dimethyl 3-hexenedioate (DMHD), are given in the Table 3. WC16 alone and the WC16+Me4Sn system are used as catalyst. In all cases, low molecular polymer and/or oligomers were obtained. In the some experiments (Nos. 1-3, 6, Table 3) methanol insoluble fractions were isolated with average molecular weight in the interval 900-2000. Experiment Nos. 4 and 5 provided only negligible amounts of methanol insoluble polymer. The major part of product were oligomers of average molecular weight slightly lower than 1000. In all cases, IR spectra of polymers and/or oligomers were similar to those of poly-DCPD, but in addition a strong band at 1730 cm-' appeared indicating the incorporation of ester units into the molecular chains. Their concentrations were calculated using the intensities of this band at 1730 cm-'. The number of ester groups per single molecule may be estimated approximately from these concentration data and the average molecular weights. In the case of DMHD, we can suppose that DMHD is consumed only by its cometathesis with DCPD and we can make similar estimation using conversion data. We have found that polymer and/or oligomer products contained 1 or 2 ester groups on average, probably in the terminal 140 H. Balcar, G.

Detailed structure of product was not determined because of the difficulties involved with isolation of individual species. In the experiment No. 2, DCPD was allowed to polymerize by WCIb at room temperature. After 22 h insoluble gel was formed. At that time, MU was added into the reactor and the temperature was raised to 70 C. In 10 hours the gel completely redissolved and the isolated polymer contained 16 wt.% of MU units. This experiment indicates that crosslinking during ROMP of DCPD was caused by ring-opening metathesis of cyclopentene rings. In addition, this experiment as well as further ones from the Table 3 (Nos. 1, 4, 5) proves that the catalytic centres created by reaction of WCIg with DCPD are active in metathesis of substrate with C=C bond in a linear chain, too. The cometathesis products prepared constitute linear or slightly branched prepolymers, i.e., starting material for polyesters. Although unicomponent catalyst can be used for this cometathesis, the WC16+Me4Sn system is more active and therefore seems to be more suitable in this case. 4. Conclusions WCIb and WC15(OAr) studied are able to act as unicomponent catalysts in metathesis of unsaturated esters. They are proved to initiate ring opening metathesis polymerization of NBEAc as well as copolymerization of NBEAc with DCPD. The interaction of ester groups with catalyst reduces catalytic activity considerably. This drop is, however, accompanied by some increase of substrate selectivity, i.e., the differences in reactivity with various kinds of C=C double bonds is deepened in the presence of ester. It is demonstrated by suppression of crosslinking during DCPD polymerization in the presence of methyl palmitate and offers the possibility to prepare non-crosslinked copolymers of DCPD with NBEAc. Linear unsaturated esters used as co-substrate to DCPD act as molecular weight regulators H. Balcar, G. Petrusovd /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 90 (1994) 135-141 141 regardless if WC16 alone or WC16 +Me4Sn system are used as catalyst. Low molecular polymer and/or oligomers with ester groups incorporated into their molecules are formed. Acknowledgement We are obliged to Mr. T.
