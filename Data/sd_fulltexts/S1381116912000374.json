Graphical abstract Hydrolysis of carbon disulfide over Fe–Cu/AC catalyst with different additive was investigated and Ni showed the best catalytic activity. Highlights ► This paper focus on catalytic hydrolysis of carbon disulfide at the low temperature (below 70°C). ► We interpret the experimental results through the characterization data. ► Fe–Cu–Ni/AC was studied as catalyst for hydrolysis of carbon disulfide. It was investigated in this work that a series of coal-based active carbon catalysts (Fe–Cu/AC) loaded by metal oxides were prepared by sol–gel method for carbon disulfide (CS2) hydrolysis. The results showed that the kind of metal oxide and its content had obvious effects on hydrolysis removal of CS2. And the optimum conditions of the catalyst was with the addition of Ni and Fe:Ni (mole ratio) 10:1. The influences of operation conditions such as: temperature, O2 concentration and relative humidity (RH) were also discussed respectively. The X-ray diffractometry (XRD) results revealed that additive doping level is an important factor which could control the generation of iron oxides as well as the incorporation crystalline phases of Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 can enhance the reaction activity of the catalysts. The surface area and pore size distribution results showed that the larger the surface area and pore volume of the samples were, the higher the hydrolysis activities were. Surface sulfate groups were observed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on exhausted catalysts and indicated that the products of CS2 hydrolysis were SO4 2− species and the formation of SO4 2− had a negative effect on the hydrolysis activity. Keywords Carbon disulfide Catalytic hydrolysis Operation condition Fe–Cu–Ni/AC catalyst 1 Introduction CS2 is a type of the sulfur-containing compounds existing in natural gas, petroleum and synthesis gas and various raw gases from coal [1]. Since CS2 possesses high toxicity with a maximum permissible concentration in air of 0.5mg/m3, its emission into atmosphere even in small amounts is inadmissible [2] and the presence of feedstock CS2 can also lead to increased corrosion of the reactors used in refinery processes [3], which triggers an increasing interest in finding reliable, cost effective technologies for its control [4]. There are several approaches to remove CS2 from the off-gas [5], including reduction, hydrolysis, adsorption, photolysis, oxidation, etc. [6], in which the hydrolysis of CS2 was recognized as the most promising process due to the mild reaction condition, cheapness, and higher conversion efficiency [7], and the final hydrolysis products, carbon oxidation (CO2) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S), are much easier to be removal than CS2 [6]. Catalytic hydrolysis of CS2 follows the reactions: (1) CS2 +H2O→COS+H2S (2) COS+H2O→CO2 +H2S (3) CS2 +2H2O→CO2 +2H2S Active carbon (AC) is widely used for various application field, such as catalyst support, adsorbent, and conductive material because of their stable structure, large specific surface area, well-developed porous structure and potential biocompatibility [8]. The pore is classified into micropore (−2nm), mesopore (2–50nm), and macropore (50nm–) [9]. Many people have attempted to modify the surface properties of AC to improve their functions in order to meet the growing demand for clear air [10]. In this study, a part of Fe–Cu/AC catalysts were modified by different metal oxides to meet the changes of the samples. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The ash content of fresh AC (LJ-40 commercial) was 12% and S BET was 749m2/g. The AC crushed and sieved to 40–60 mesh size was used a matrix. The AC was washed four times by distilled water. The catalyst was prepared with sol–gel method. Firstly, the commercial AC was dipped in a solution of 1M caustic potash (KOH) and boiled for 1.5h, then washed by distilled water till no further change in pH, followed filtered and dried for 3–4h at 120°C in the drying oven. Secondly, we made colloid solution with loaded 5% iron oxides and Fe:Cu (mole ratio) 5:1 with a certain amount of metal nitrate solution for additives. Then the sample was added into the hydrosol. Thirdly, the catalyst was dipped under the ultrasonic for 30min, dried at 120°C in the drying oven and calcined for 3h at 400°C in a tubular furnace in air atmosphere with 82.4kPa of atmospheric pressure. At last the catalyst calcined was dipped in 5wt% KOH and kept under the ultrasonic for 30min, then dried for 3h at 120°C in the drying oven to get the catalyst needed for the experiments. 2.2 Characterization 2.2.1 X-ray diffraction (XRD) X-ray diffraction (D/MAX-2200) pattern were obtained with a Rigaku diffractiometer operated at 36kV and 30mA by using Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ =0.15406nm) at a rate of 5°/min from 2θ =20° to 80°. The powdered samples were analyzed without previous treatment after deposition on an agate mortar. The identification of crystalline phases was made by matching the JCPDS files. 2.2.2 Surface area and pore size distribution Surface area and pore size distribution for the samples were measured using a NOVA2000e (Quantachrome instruments) surface area analyzer that uses a nitrogen adsorption–desorption method. The samples were initially outgassed at 393K for 24h before adsorption isotherms were generated by dosing nitrogen (at 77K) on the carbons. The density functional theory (DFT) model was used to analyze the result. 2.2.3 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) XPS (PHI 5500) analysis used Al Kα radiation with energy of Al rake and power 200W. Kinetic energies of the photoelectrons were measured with a two-stage spectrometer. The analyzer resolution was 1eV. An Ar+ ion gun was used to sputter clean specimen surfaces. The ion energy was set to 1keV and the sputtering time was 10min. The photoelectron spectra were calibrated using the C 1s signal detected at a binding energy of 284.8eV from adventitious carbon. Atomic compositions were calculated with the corrected Scofield coefficients of the transmission function of the analyzer and/or with experimental coefficients determined for a reference compound. The continuum spectrum was fitted according to the Gaussian–Lorentzian files. 2.2.4 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) made in American Varian Company was used to determine sulfur-containing species formed on catalyst surface. Before the analysis, the samples were ground, mixed, and palletized with potassium bromide. 2.3 Experimental procedure Catalytic activity tests were carried out under atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed quartz reactor system (4mm inside diameter×100mm length). The catalyst was loaded into the fixed bed and a wad of cotton wool was inserted into the reactor so that the catalyst could not escape from the vessel during the operation. CS2 from gas cylinder (0.3% CS2 in N2) was diluted with nitrogen (99.99%) and oxygen (99.999%). Water was introduced using a saturator system. The temperature of this reactor was controlled by water-bath with circulating pump, with accuracy of ±0.1°C. The total CS2 concentration of gaseous feed and effluent from the reactor were analyzed by an online HC-6 sulfur phosphorus microscale analyzer with a FPD detector while the different S-components (COS and H2S) in outlet gas were determined by switching chromatographic column. In this paper, a method simultaneously removing CS2 and its hydrolysis products COS and H2S at lower temperature (50°C) was introduced, with other conditions of gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 7000h−1, 255mg/m3 CS2 and atmospheric pressure. The conversion of CS2 is determined by analyzing the inlet and outlet concentration of CS2: CS 2 conversion ( % ) = CS 2 inlet − CS 2 outlet CS 2 inlet × 100 Sulfur capacity is defined as the sulfur deposition in the unit mass of desulfurizer agent in CS2 (in the quality of agent sulfur) quality, by conversion of the time points. The conversion rate of 90% of the sulfur content is defined as the penetration of sulfur content. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Effect of different metal oxides for additive on Fe–Cu/AC catalyst and Ni loading amount on catalytic hydrolysis of CS2 The experiments in this part were aimed to find the optimal additive and component of Fe–Cu/AC catalyst for CS2 hydrolysis. Additives can change the properties of catalyst, which are chemical structure and composition, the pore and crystal structure, pH, etc. To investigate the effect of different additives on catalytic hydrolysis of CS2, nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O), aluminum nitrate (Al(NO3)3·9H2O) and zinc nitrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O) were respectively added with the concentration of 5% Fe2O3 and mole ratio Fe:Cu:A=10:2:1 (A is Ni, Al or Zn). The data were plotted in Fig. 1(a). The results showed that the addition of Ni or Zn to Fe–Cu/AC, especially of Ni, showed obvious advantage in catalytic hydrolysis of CS2. Fe–Cu–Ni/AC catalyst exhibited significantly better performance compared with other catalyst. Moreover, the catalytic activity of Fe–Cu–Al/AC was significantly lower than that of Fe–Cu/AC. This may be because: the addition of Al makes the promote interaction between the active component disappearing and the reactivity of active sites on the catalyst surface is not formed with S atoms in the initial reaction. In addition, Al is a kind of amphoteric metal while alkaline is beneficial to CS2 hydrolysis. While the addition of Ni or Zn may increase active sites on the surface of the catalyst and stable activity of Fe atoms with crystal face. These results also suggested that NiO–CuO–Fe2O3 interaction was favorable and the interaction between Fe–Cu and the supporter was also greatly enhanced with the addition of Ni. As discussed previously, Ni provided active sites and improves the catalytic activities. To get the optimal catalyst, in this study, with Fe/Cu molar ratio fixed at 5, three Fe/Ni mole rates were used to prepare Fe–Cu–Ni/AC catalysts: 5, 10, 20. As described in Fig. 1(b), the addition of different Ni loading had increasing the activity to different extents regardless of the Ni composition, and Fe–Cu–Ni/AC catalyst with Fe/Ni=10 showed the highest activity. However, sequentially increasing the Ni content had a negative effect on CS2 hydrolysis, while the activities were not significantly changed when the Fe/Ni ratio fell from 20 to 5. Maybe too high loading amount of Ni formed nickel particles reunion so that the contact between CS2 and aggregate grains or particles of Ni was restricted, then the hydrolysis activity decreased. The structural characterizations of different samples were performed by XRD analysis in order to explain the influence of the different metal oxides for additives. The phase and crystalline orientation of samples were exhibited in Fig. 2 . The peak intensity of five samples changed with doping different precursors, but these changes were comparatively weak. This is due to the poor crystallinity and the amounts of metal oxides (CuO, NiO, ZnO, Al2O3) are far less than AC. In the XRD peak patterns, peaks with strong intensity appear at 2θ =30.175°, 35.439°, 57.193° and 62.895°, and these diffraction lines confirm the formation of Fe2O3 which are contained in the AC used as active component. For Fe/AC, most diffraction peaks belong to the tetragonal of maghemite-Q (Fe2O3), and there is no peak attributed to Fe3O4. The amount of Fe2O3 in Fe–Cu/AC, Fe–Cu–Al/AC, Fe–Cu–Ni/AC, Fe–Cu–Zn/AC is less than that in Fe/AC, furthermore, much weaker diffraction lines of Fe3O4 phase (magnetite) is detected, regardless of which additive. XRD results also indicated that additive doping level is an important factor that could control the generation of iron oxides. Taking both the results of catalytic activity and the XRD characterization into account, incorporation crystalline phases of Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 can improve the reaction activity of the catalysts. These observations of the peaks suggest that Ni or Zn addition affects the crystalline phase of Fe and increase the Fe dispersion resulting in the higher hydrolysis activity. The nitrogen adsorption isotherms were measured and the detailed information on the textural properties of these samples was listed in Table 1 . The Fe–Cu–Ni/AC catalyst is the most porous sample with high surface area about 684.10m2/g and Fe/AC material is the least porous sample of all samples studied with low surface area about 548.81m2/g. From Table 1, it can be concluded that the addition of both Ni and Zn can increase the surface areas and the pore volume, significantly. That increase in the pore volume suggests that the addition of Ni or Zn has an effect on under-reaming. However, after introduction of Al to the Fe–Cu/AC catalyst, a decrease in surface area and total pore volume and an increase in average micropore size are observed. The decreasing of the S BET might be due to the following reasons, i.e. the interaction between the active component and the support disappears or the promoter action among the active component becomes lower after introduction of Al species. Fig. 3(a) shows the nitrogen adsorption isotherms for some typical samples. According to the IUPAC classification [11], the adsorption isotherms of all samples are type I, i.e. the knee of the isotherm is sharp and the plateau is fairly horizontal, which indicates these samples are the materials with microporrous. Nevertheless, there is some contribution of mesoporosity to the total porosity, as indicated by the slight hysteresis of the isotherms. This is supported by the results of pore size distributions presented in Fig. 3(b). As shown in Fig. 3(b), all the pores of five samples are lower than 8.0nm and a significant volume is lower than 3.0nm. In case of Fe–Cu–Zn/AC, the volume of pores with a width of larger than 3.0nm is obviously more than the other four samples. After modification with Cu and Ni the volume of pores with a width of lower than 3.0nm increases. It is likely that some previously existing small pores (<3nm) are bearizing in Fe–Cu–Ni/AC and the larger pores (>3nm) are reaming in Fe–Cu–Zn/AC. Therefore, the surface area and pore volume of Fe–Cu–Ni/AC are relative larger. These results may also suggest that pores (1.5–3.0nm) play an important role in the CS2 hydrolysis reaction. These also indicate that Ni species induce the creation of structural defects in the metal oxide, leading to smaller grain size compared with other additives. 3.2 Effect of operation conditions on catalytic hydrolysis of CS2 over Fe–Cu–Ni/AC catalysts 3.2.1 Effect of temperature on catalytic hydrolysis of CS2 The influence of temperature on the catalytic performance over Fe–Cu–Ni/AC catalyst was presented in Fig. 4 , respectively. With the increasing temperature from 30 to 70°C, the hydrolysis activity initially increases and then decreases and this reaction is sensitive to the reaction temperature. It is interesting to note that at reaction temperature (50°C), this catalyst shows the best catalytic performance and no better effect occurs with the increase of temperature. Because of low temperature, the rate of CS2 hydrolysis is lower which resulted in poor removal capability. As the temperature enhances, the hydrolysis rate of CS2 accelerates, and the rate of sulfur species formation also enhances [12], while the formation of sulfur species brings out the catalyst poisoning. Due to this negative factor, it offsets the positive impact of raising the temperature effect. The conversion of hydrolysis product (H2S) to S or sulfate on modified AC is parallel-reactions, and with the increase of temperature, the yield rate of sulfuric acid will increase faster than that of element S [13]. At higher temperature, the selectivity of sulfur in H2S oxidation is lower than that at lower temperature. The higher concentration of SO4 2− poisons the hydrolysis active sites [14], and then deactivation of the catalyst for CS2 hydrolysis occurs. 3.2.2 Effect of O2 content on catalytic hydrolysis of CS2 The results of the influence of O2 content on the catalytic performance have been plotted in Fig. 5 . It is clear that the addition of O2 to the inlet flow enhances the catalytic activity in the CS2 hydrolysis. As can be seen from this figure, the CS2 hydrolysis capacity increases with increasing amounts of O2, however, decreases with sequential addition of O2 when O2 content is above 2.3vol%. This may be because: on the one hand, catalytic hydrolysis of CS2 is the hydrolysis of CS2 itself, the other is the oxidative removal of H2S-hydrolysis product. H2S oxidation on impregnated AC occurs through an interaction between the adsorbed H2S and the oxygen adsorbed on impregnated AC, and the reaction equation is H2S+O2 –H2O+S/SO4 2−. These occurring reactions accelerate strongly with increasing oxygen concentration to some extent [13]. The introduction of low volume fraction of O2, H2S can be oxidized in a timely manner, conducive to the hydrolysis of CS2. However, further increasing O2 concentration, the rate of H2S oxidation increases resulting in the catalyst exhausted [13]. To guarantee the complete oxidation of H2S and to obtain higher sulfur capacity, the optimum O2 content is 2.3% for the catalytic hydrolysis of CS2. The surface concentration of different S species on exhausted catalyst surface was estimated by XPS. The results were listed in Table 2 . Generally, these peaks signal at 171.79eV, 169.71eV, 170.39eV, and 168.56eV are assigned to SO4 2− [15]. It can be observed that the binding energy of S 2p shifts the presence of O2 in the flow and the content of sulfates is also changed slightly on the exhausted catalysts. It is indicated that the presence of O2 can affect the formation and content of SO4 2−. 3.2.3 Effect of RH on catalytic hydrolysis of CS2 The curve plotted in Fig. 6 provided an idea that how the CS2 removal efficiency varied with the different relative humidity (RH). The results clearly indicate the importance of RH on the catalytic performance. RH effects on CS2 removal are investigated by introducing the feed gas through a humidifier at different temperatures to saturate it to a different extent. The experimental results showed that different RH made the hydrolysis activity disparate. The introduction of low volume fraction of water (H2O) is conductive to the hydrolysis activity. However, the presence of excess water would inhibit the chemisorption of CS2, leading to a decrease in the hydrolysis reaction by the competitive adsorption between CS2 and H2O. Moreover, when the RH is 5%, the catalyst manifests the best activity. Fig. 6 shows that when the feed gas was not through the saturator the reaction activity of CS2 removal was better than that with the RH higher than 12.5%. The explanation for the above phenomenon is that there is some bound water within the catalyst, resulting in an initial high CS2 conversion. However, as the reaction goes on, the bound water would be depleted gradually and the conversion of CS2 declined. This phenomenon implies that the adsorption could be equally strong for both CS2 and H2O, providing indirect evidence for the competitive adsorption between the two reactants. CS2 hydrolysis reaction at lower temperature proceeds by the reaction of adsorbed CS2 with surface hydroxyl species, which are replenished by adsorption of water on the surface [16]. On the one hand, catalytic hydrolysis of CS2 is the hydrolysis of CS2 and the other is the oxidative removal of H2S-hydrolysis product. RH plays different functions on CS2 hydrolysis and H2S oxidation. The adsorption capacity of CS2 in damp gas is 60–80% less than that of CS2 in dry gas, due to the competitive adsorption between CS2 and H2O [17]. The adsorbed water will enable the dissociation of H2S molecules to hydrogen sulfide ions HS−, which can then be oxidized to S [18]. Water played an important role in H2S oxidation on impregnated AC. With the increase of RH, the rate of H2S oxidation will enhance greatly [19]. Although RH has an effect on both CS2 hydrolysis and H2S oxidation, CS2 hydrolysis is the rate-determining step during this process [20]. Thus, the negative impact of competitive adsorption of water with CS2 on the catalyst surface predominates over the positive impact of water supplying more hydroxyl species. Fig. 7 shows the FT-IR spectra of the catalysts after CS2 treatment with different content of H2O. As shown in Fig. 7, a broad strong absorption band at 3427cm−1 is noted, which can be attributed to OH combination stretching vibration of hydroxyl groups and physically adsorbed water [21]. CS2 introduction at different water saturator temperature does not apparently perturb the OH groups after the catalyst used. A broad shoulder is also observed near 1635cm−1 due to the crystal waterOH groups [22], which indicates that there is still a certain amount of water within the sample. This may be because: the sample in the calcination temperature 400°C fails to completely remove the bound water. As for that at 1400cm−1, it reveals the formation of sulfate species [23]. And in the vicinity of 1110cm−1 there is a adsorption peak, mainly asymmetric stretching vibration of SO4 2− [24]. The peak at 2360cm−1 is attributed to CO stretching vibration, the vibrations increase in the exhausted catalysts. 4 Conclusions The experimental results showed that the kind of metal oxide and its content had obvious effect on hydrolysis removal of CS2, and the optimum conditions of the catalysts were that the catalyst was with the addition of Ni and Fe:Ni (mole ratio) 10:1. The influences of operation conditions such as: reaction temperature, O2 concentration and relative humidity were also discussed respectively. That CS2 hydrolysis reaction is sensitive to the reaction temperature and relative humidity was analyzed by experiments. The XRD results revealed that additive doping level is an important factor which could control the generation of iron oxides along with the incorporation crystalline phases of Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 can enhance the reaction activity of the catalysts. The surface area and pore size distribution results showed that the larger the surface area and pore volume of the samples were, the higher the hydrolysis activities were. Based on the above studies and the XPS as well as FT-IR, it can be inferred that the production of H2S can be converted to surface SO4 2− species and the activities of catalysts decrease with the SO4 2− species accumulated on the activated carbon surface.
