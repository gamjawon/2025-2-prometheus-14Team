Graphical abstract Highlights ► A novel room-temperature imidazolium ionic liquid doped with Mg2+ cation was prepared. ► Exchanging Cl− of the IL with BF4 − enhanced the catalytic activity of the dopant Mg2+. ► It offered the dual benefits of catalyst and solvent in the trial organic syntheses. ► The integrity of the ionic liquid virtually remains unchanged after recycling. A homogeneous ionic liquid made up of 0.5mol% Mg(BF4)2 doped in [BMIm]BF4 was obtained from a mixture of MgCl2 and [BMIm]Cl subjected to anion exchange with NaBF4. The ionic liquid efficiently catalyzes the synthesis of 1,8-dioxo-octahydroxanthenes, 14-aryl-14H-dibenzo[a,j]xanthenes, and 1,8-dioxo-decahydroacridines, giving excellent yields in short periods of time at 80°C. The integrity of the ionic liquid remains reasonably unchanged when it is separated from the reaction mixture by water extraction, as it can be recycled several times without any loss of activity in each of the title syntheses. Magnesium cation, though in low concentration, appeared as an essential element of this ionic liquid catalysis, perhaps due to its non-coordinated existence giving rise to a promoted Lewis acidic characteristic. Application of this new homogeneous catalyst system offered the advantages of high yields, short reaction times, and easy workup procedure compared to the conventional methods of the syntheses. Keywords Xanthenes Acridines Ionic liquid Magnesium cation Homogeneous catalyst 1 Introduction Though ionic liquids belong to the class of strongly polar solvents capable to dissolve both organic and inorganic materials, they may be designed non-coordinating, in contrast to polar molecular solvents, to avoid any undesirable binding to metal catalysts in pre-transition states and hence offer great advantages in terms of catalysis and selectivity [1–4]. In such conditions, metal catalysts exist relatively uncomplexed and their almost bare cations are expected to have higher activity than in traditional polar organic solvents. Application of the ionic liquids composed of weakly coordinating anions, such as BF4 − and PF6 −, together with suitably substituted cations often resulted in a pronounced chemical reactivity of the dissolved catalysts and therefore led to improvement of both reactivity and selectivity [5–7]. Moreover, ionic liquids by virtue of their organic and ionic nature are potent solvents to exert nearly all kinds of interactions on reacting species including transition states. Usually, these interactions alternatively give rise to considerable reductions in activation energies either by stabilization of transition states or destabilization of reactants. As a result, the catalytic activity of ionic liquids strongly depends on their chemical and physical properties and in turn on the properties of their cationic and anionic constituents. Another aspect of ionic liquids is their potential to bias reaction equilibriums in favor of products. For example, hydrophilic ionic liquids tend to facilitate dehydration of intermediate products by stabilizing the eliminated water molecules [8]. Owing to these fascinating features associated with easy phase-separation from reaction mixtures, ionic liquids have achieved an outstanding position as a new generation of solvents in the area of organic synthesis. In continuation of our studies focused on development of ionic liquids as catalysts in synthesis of organic compounds [9–12], herein we describe the efficiencies of the ionic liquid composed of Mg(BF4)2 doped in [BMIm][BF4] for promoting the synthesis of 1,8-dioxo-octahydroxanthenes, 14-aryl-14H-dibenzo[a,j]xanthenes and 1,8-dioxo-decahydroacridines. Xanthenes and benzoxanthene derivatives are the parent frameworks found in a large number of naturally occurring as well as synthetic products possessing prominent positions in medicinal chemistry [13,14]. Xanthenediones are likewise special structural units constituting various natural products [15] and being used as versatile synthons, because of inherent reactivity of their inbuilt pyran ring [16]. Consequently, many alternative catalysts such as p-toluenesulfonic acid [17], p-dodecylbenzenesulphonic acid [18], triethylbenzylammonium chloride [19], diammoniumhydrogen phosphate under various conditions [20], sulfonic acid under ultrasonic irradiation [21], InCl3/ionic liquid [22], Fe3+–montmorilonite [23], NaHSO4–SiO2 or silica chloride [24], amberlyst-15 [25], P2O5 or InCl3 [26], montmorilonite [27], and silica sulfuric acid [28] have been used for the synthesis of xanthenedione derivatives. However, each of the methods have their own merit some methods suffer from long reaction times, low yields, use of large quantities of volatile organic solvents, harsh reaction conditions, and tedious workup. Therefore, development of an alternative efficient and versatile method for synthesis of these valuable compounds could be so worthwhile. 1,4-Dihydropyridines represent an important class of compounds which are found in many sorts of biologically active compounds such as vasodilators, bronchodilators, anti-atherosclerotics, antitumors, geroprotectives, hepatoprotective agents [29], and calcium channel blockers [30,31]. 1,8-Dioxo-decahydroacridines with inbuilt 1,4-dihydropyridine nucleus have shown very high lasing efficiencies [32] and hence used as photoinitiators [33]. As a consequence of these interesting properties, a large library of acridinediones has been synthesized by the reaction of aldehydes with 2 equivalents of 1,3-cyclohexanedione or 5,5-dimethyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione and appropriate amines via various methods [34–38]. 2 Results and discussion Magnesium constitutes the central element of several frequently used efficient catalysts and involves, at normal oxidation state, in bioactivities of living organisms implying its bio-friendlier consistency. Despite of these fascinating features and several recent reports on utility of magnesium compounds as catalysts [39–41], so far the catalysis capacity of magnesium cation has not been examined in ionic-liquid medium. It seems reasonable to expect that Mg2+ cations dissolved in less coordinative ionic medium would have intensed chemical activity. To deal with this idea, we required a homogeneous solution of Mg2+ in an ionic liquid composed of a bulky organic cation and an almost non-coordinating anion. In this regard, a room temperature ionic liquid was prepared via saturation of [BMIm]BF4 with Mg(BF4)2. Atomic absorption analysis of this liquid has shown that it is 0.5mol% in concentration of dissolved Mg2+ ion. This low saturated concentration of Mg2+ is not more surprising by considering that it is a hard cation being dissolved mostly in favor of increased entropy and without receiving significant solvating interactions with the ionic liquid. The new ion–ion electrostatic bondings created on dissolution of Mg2+ ions in [BMIm]BF4 are rather weak forces assuming to be insufficient to completely cover the lattice energy of the initial magnesium salt. It was initially difficult to expect that such a low-concentration of Mg2+ ions could impart any considerable catalysis activity to the ionic liquid. However, the ionic solution appeared as a very efficient catalyst when applied to three defined acid-demanded trial reactions. Certainly, the catalysis activity is attributed to the dissolved Lewis acidic Mg2+ ions, as the reactions have not remarkably proceeded in the Mg2+-free ionic liquid, [BMIm]BF4. Activity of the catalyst was first evaluated for synthesis of xanthene-1,8-diones by examining its impact on the rate and yield of the model reaction between 5,5-dimethyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione 1 and 4-chlorobenzaldehyde. To determine the optimum condition and also to discerning the main element of the catalysis, the reaction was carried out at variable temperatures and alternatively in closely related ionic liquids (Table 1 ). It could be seen that the best result was obtained with 1mL of [BMIm][BF4]–0.5mol% Mg(BF4)2 at 80°C (Table 1, entry 7). Monitoring by TLC has shown no detectable progress of the reaction in the ionic liquids [BMIm]BF4 and [BMIm]Cl. These observations are addressing the catalysis interactions to Mg2+ ion and not owing to strictly ionic nature of the catalyst. Interestingly, the model reaction gave low yield in even long time when it was run at 80°C in the ionic liquid [BMIm][BF4]–0.5mol% MgCl2 being made simply by dissolving 0.5mol% MgCl2 in [BMIm][BF4]. In this ionic solution, the Mg2+ ions are assumed to be relatively tethered by coordination with chloride ions. This finding clearly lends considerable credence to hypothesis that Mg2+ ion gains an enhanced catalytic activity in the non-coordinating medium of [BMIm]BF4. After optimizing the conditions, the scope of method was successfully testified by using a wide range of aromatic aldehydes at 80°C. The results, summarized in Table 2 , delineate the efficiencies of the method in terms of fairly high yields of the products and short reaction times. To compare the efficiencies of this ionic liquid system with the previously reported catalysts in synthesis of xanthenes, we have gathered the results obtained by using this ionic liquid and those reported on application of some other catalysts to the synthesis of 9-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,8-dioxo-octahydroxanthene 3b in Table 3 . As is shown in Table 3, effecting the reaction in the ionic liquid appreciably improves the synthesis in several aspects featured by some other methods, for example higher temperatures, longer reaction times, lower yields, and limitation of the substrate applicability. The reaction goes to complete in shorter time and affords high yield when is run in the [BMIm]BF4–0.5mol% Mg-(BF4)2 at 80°C. Further evidences on efficiency of this catalyst were obtained by application of the ionic system to the synthesis of dibenzo[a,j]xanthenes using the pseudo-three-component reaction between 2-naphthol and various aldehydes at 80°C. As is shown in Table 4 , the reactivity of 2-naphthol with aldehydes in the ionic liquid spans a considerable range, affording a variety of 14-substituted-14H-dibenzo[a,j]xanthenes. It is noteworthy that the presence of electron-donating and electron-accepting as well as steric demanded substituents on the reacting aldehydes does not affect the overall yield and rate of the reactions sensibly. However specifying the exact catalysis events through the formation of xanthenes awaits for further investigations, a reasonable interpretation for catalytic actions of the ionic liquid based on a more accepted mechanism of the reactions [25,26] was depicted in Scheme 1 . The xanthene synthesis presumably initiates by nucleophilic addition of the substrate phenol 4 or the enol 1 on the reactant aldehyde activated by magnesium cation. The resulting adduct 6 undergoes dehydration to give the key enone intermediate 7 which is likely activated by magnesium cation to follow a Michael type addition onto the second molecule of 1 or 4. The later reaction would produce the bis-phenol or alternatively the bis-enol intermediate 8 ensuing a magnesium cation mediated dehydration to afford the xanthenes 3 or 5. Encouraged by these results, we aimed to evaluate the catalytic method for the reaction of 5,5-dimethyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione 1, an aldehyde, and NH4OAc in 1mL of [BMIm][BF4]–0.5mol% Mg(BF4)2 at 80°C to afford 1,8-dioxo-decahydroacridine derivatives 9a–j. Again the reactions went to completion within short periods of time to give fairly high yields of the products. Here also the aromatic aldehydes containing electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups afforded fairly high yields of 1,8-dioxo-decahydroacridines (Table 5 ). All the products are known compounds, and their identity were verified by IR and 1H NMR spectroscopic analysis as well as comparison of their physical data with those of authentic samples. Workup procedure is so simple for all the syntheses and includes addition of water at the end of reaction, filtration, and finally recrystallization of the products from ethanol. The ionic liquid was removed simply by dissolution in water added to the reaction mixture and then recovered by evaporation of water at 80°C under reduced pressure. The catalytic activity of the ionic liquid system remained evidently unaltered even after five successive retrieval and when reused in the same synthesis (Table 6 ). 3 Experimental All the solvents and reagents were purchased from Fluka or Merck chemical companies. Melting points were measured on an Electrothermal apparatus and are uncorrected. IR spectra were obtained in KBr discs on a Shimadzu IR-470 spectrometer. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a BRUKER DRX-300 AVANCE spectrometer at 300.13MHz. 3.1 Synthesis of the ionic liquid [Bmim][BF4]–0.5mol% Mg(BF4)2 1-Methylimidazole (5.1g, 62.1mmol) was added to 32mL of 1-chlorobutane. The mixture was heated to reflux for 24h and then cooled to room temperature. The obtained oily product was separated from reaction mixture by decanting and washed with EtOAc (2× 20mL). Solvent of the collected organic phase was removed under reduced pressure to give 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([BMIm]Cl). In second step, to a solution of [BMIm]Cl (7.0g, 40.1mmol) and MgCl2 (1.0g, 10.5mmol) diluted with dry acetone (50mL) was added NaBF4 (8.7g, 79.2mmol). The mixture was stirred for 48h at room temperature to get a solution and then to afford precipitation of NaCl. After separation of the precipitates (mainly NaCl associated with excess Mg2+ salts) the solvent of the filtered solution was removed under reduced pressure whereupon the ionic liquid [BMIm] BF4 doped with Mg(BF4)2 was obtained as a yellow oil. Atomic absorption analysis of the obtained ionic liquid has revealed a concentration of 0.6mg/mL of Mg2+ being equal to 0.5mol% of Mg2+ in the ionic liquid. 3.2 General procedure for preparation of 1,8-dioxo-octahydroxanthenes and 14-aryl-14H-dibenzo[a,j]xanthene derivatives To a mixture of an aromatic aldehyde (1mmol) and 5,5-dimethyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione or 2-naphthol (2mmol) in a round bottom flask was added 1mL of [BMIm][BF4]–0.5mol% Mg(BF4)2. The mixture was heated at 80°C and the reaction was monitored by TLC using silica gel coated on aluminum sheets and ethyl acetate–petroleum ether as eluent. After completion of the reaction, water (8mL) was added to the mixture and filtered. The solid residue was recrystallized from ethanol 95.5%. 3.3 General procedure for the synthesis of 1,8-dioxo-decahydroacridine derivatives Ammonium acetate (0.09g, 1.2mmol) was added to the solution of an aromatic aldehyde (1mmol) and 5,5-dimethyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione (0.28g, 2mmol) in 1mL of [BMIm]BF4–0.5mol% Mg(BF4)2. The reaction was conducted under the conditions mentioned above. After completion of the reaction, water (8mL) was added to the mixture and filtered. The solid residue was recrystallized from ethanol 95.5%. 4 Conclusion An enhanced catalytic activity was observed for the magnesium salt of a less coordinative anion, Mg(BF4)2, dissolved in the ionic liquid [BMIm]BF4. Based on this finding, the ionic liquid [BMIm]BF4 doped with 0.5mol% Mg(BF4)2 was prepared and employed in development of an expedient method for the synthesis of 1,8-dioxo-octahydroxanthenes, 14-aryl-14H-dibenzo[a,j]xanthenes, and 1,8-dioxo-decahydroacridines. The ionic liquid system tolerates the presence of various functional groups on the aldehydes used in this investigation and have the advantages of being inexpensive, easily available, and reusable. It is a dilute homogeneous metal catalyst having the capacity to dissolve the reactants and tolerating air and moisture due to stability of its ionic constituents. Application of this catalyst offered a simple, clean, and cost effective method for the synthesis of the title compounds. It is important to note that in the absence of the ionic liquid, the yields of reactions were traced even at 80°C and longer reaction time.
