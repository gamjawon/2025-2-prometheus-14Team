However, such an approach employs expensive noble-metal-based electrocatalysts, which severely undermines its feasibility when implemented on an industrial scale. Herein, based on density functional theory computations and microkinetic modeling, we demonstrate that a novel two-dimensional (2D) material, namely a 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer, can serve as an efficient non-precious electrocatalyst to facilitate the 2e-ORR. The 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer is a stable 2D crystal that can be easily produced through exfoliation techniques. The surface-exposed Te sites of the 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer exhibit a favorable OOH* binding energy of 4.24 eV, resulting in a rather high basal plane activity toward the 2e-ORR. Importantly, kinetic computations indicate that the 1T'-MoTe2 monolayer preferentially promotes the formation of H2O2 over the competing four-electron ORR step. These desirable characteristics render 1T′-MoTe2 a promising candidate for catalyzing the electrochemical reduction of O2 to H2O2.

At present, most of the commercial H2O2 is prepared via the traditional anthraquinone method, which involves extremely high energy consumption and large-scale chemical plant equipment. H2O2 prepared via the anthraquinone method is typically stored and transported at high concentrations (70%), which significantly increases storage and transportation risks [1–3]. In addition to the anthraquinone method, synthesizing H2O2 from hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) in the presence of Pd-based catalysts is a feasible approach. This method requires combining H2 and O2 under high pressure, which increases the risk of combustion and explosion, rendering the large-scale commercialization of H2O2 by this method very difficult [4,5]. There is an urgent need to explore other effective methods for the green, mild, and on-demand synthesis of H2O2. The redox reactions of H2 and O2 can be divided into two independent cell reactions in the electrochemical synthesis method, which effectively circumvents the possibility of an explosion that could arise because of directly combining H2 and O2. Furthermore, the electrochemical synthesis of H2O2 via oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) can also use the electricity generated by wind, solar, and other renewable energy sources, which represents a green and efficient approach [6–8]. However, the large-scale implementation of this method is limited by the lack of suitable catalysts. It is known that ORR can either proceed via a four-electron (4e) pathway to form water or a two-electron (2e) pathway to form H2O2. Since 4e-ORR is a cathode reaction of fuel cells, it has attracted significant research interest in the past few decades, and many catalysts with high catalytic activity and selectivity for 4e-ORR have been reported [9–13]. Conversely, the 2e-ORR is considered an unfavorable side reaction of fuel cells; therefore, there are few related studies. Currently recognized catalysts for electrocatalytic ORR toward the production of H2O2 under acidic conditions are Pd-Hg, Pt-Hg, and Pd-Au alloys; however, their high cost severely limits their applications [14–17]. Carbon materials exhibit good catalytic performance under alkaline conditions. Nevertheless, the high instability of H2O2 under alkaline conditions restricts the application of the alkaline ORR method in H2O2 production [18,19]. Therefore, the development of inexpensive catalysts that can efficiently catalyze the reduction of O2 to H2O2 under acidic conditions has become critical for researchers in this field. In recent years, the rise and development of two-dimensional (2D) materials have provided new opportunities for the development of high-efficiency catalysts. Compared with traditional materials, 2D materials have an ultra-high specific surface area and surface atomic ratio, which are very conducive to their application in the field of catalysis [20–23]. Experimental and theoretical studies have demonstrated that many transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as 2H-MoS2, have strong HER catalytic performance [24–28]. Recently, Li et al. [29] discovered that 2H-MoTe2 has considerable catalytic activity in the electrochemical reduction of O2 to H2O2 in acidic media; this leads to new expectations of the development of 2e-ORR. However, similar to many other TMDs [24–26], 2H-MoTe2 active sites are concentrated at its layer edges (i.e., limited edge-Te sites), whereas the dominant sites (i.e., highly exposed basal-plane-Te sites) are inert to facilitate the 2e-ORR, resulting in a low catalytic efficiency. In addition to the conventional 2H phase, 2D MoTe2 exhibits a stable 1T′ phase, which was prepared via the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method at moderate quenching temperatures [30]. In particular, the 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer was predicted to be semi-metallic, which is superior to semiconducting 2H-MoTe2 in electrocatalysis applications. Therefore, 1T′-MoTe2 is a promising electrocatalyst for 2e-ORR, with basal plane activity. However, to the best of our knowledge, the electrocatalytic activity of 1T′-MoTe2 has not been explored either experimentally or theoretically. In this study, we systematically studied the structural and catalytic properties of a 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer through density functional theory (DFT) computations. The 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer was experimentally feasible and had good stability. Remarkably, its basal plane exhibited superior activity and high selectivity toward 2e-ORR, rendering the 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer a promising candidate for H2O2 production. 2 Computational details 2.1 DFT computations DFT computations were conducted using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [31] with projector-augmented wave (PAW) formalism [32,33]. Generalized gradient approximation (GGA), as parameterized by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) [34], was adopted to describe the electronic exchange. Spin polarization was considered in all computations. Brillouin zone was sampled using a Monkhorst-Pack 3 × 3 × 1 k-point grid. With the plane wave basis set, a kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV was set to expand the electronic wave functions at each k-point. During geometry optimization, the atomic positions were optimized until the force was less than 0.01 eV Å−1. The convergence threshold for energy was set to 1 × 10−5 eV. The distance of the vacuum space for monolayer computations was set to 15 Å in order to avoid interactions between periodic images. Grimme's D3 method was adopted in the computations to describe van der Waals (vdW) interactions [35,36]. The solvent effect on reaction intermediates was considered using Poisson–Boltzmann implicit solvation model [37]. Climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method [38] was employed to locate the transition states (TSs) of all elementary reactions and determine the energy barriers. The phonon spectrum of the 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer was computed using Phonopy code [39] within the finite displacement method. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were performed using a MoTe2 monolayer supercell (4 × 4 × 1) within NVT ensemble, and the temperatures of the systems were controlled using the Nosé-Hoover method [40]. 2.2 Free energy computations We used a computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model to explore the catalytic activity of the 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer [41]. A supercell slab (2 × 3 × 1) of 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer was constructed to assess its 2e-ORR activity, and all atoms in this slab (including adsorbates) were allowed to relax during geometry optimization. The free energy change for each elementary reaction step in the 2e-ORR process was computed using the following equation: (1) ΔG = ΔE + ΔZPE + ∫ΔC pdT – TΔS + ΔG U + ΔG PH where ΔE is the change in reaction energy based on DFT computations, ΔZPE is the change in zero-point energy, ΔC p is the change in heat capacity, and ΔS is the change in entropy. For adsorbates, these free energy contributions were determined from vibrational frequency calculations with harmonic approximation, and the partial contributions from the pristine 1T′-MoTe2 slab were neglected. In the CHE model, the effects of the electrode potential (U) and pH on ORR are treated as the energy shift to free energy change in the electrochemical steps: (2) ΔG U = –eU (3) ΔG pH = k BTln10 × pH where U is the electrode potential and k B is the Boltzmann constant. As the DFT method cannot describe the energy of triplet O2 molecule accurately, the free energy of O2 was derived from the reaction O2 + 2H2 → 2H2O, of which the free energy change is 4.92 eV under a temperature of 298.15 K and pressure of 0.035 bar. According to the CHE model [41], the free energy of H+ in solution is defined as half that of H2. The heat capacities, entropies, and vibrational frequencies of the free molecules in the gas phase were derived from the NIST database, while for the ORR intermediates, they were computed from the vibrational frequencies. 2.3 Microkinetic modeling In accordance with previous studies by Hansen et al. [42,43], we have established a microkinetic model of 2e-ORR on a 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer, wherein the following elementary reactions (referred to as “steps”) are considered: (4) O 2 ( aq ) ⇄ k 1 k – 1 O 2 ( dl ) (5) * + O 2 ( dl ) ⇄ k 2 k – 2 O 2 * (6) O 2 * + H + + e – ⇄ k 3 k – 3 OOH * (7) OOH * + H + + e – ⇄ k 4 k – 4 H 2 O 2 + * where ki is the forward rate constant and k –i is the backward rate constant. The first step represents the diffusion of O2 from the electrolyte O2(aq) to the catalyst-electrolyte interface O2(dl). The second step was the formation of O2*. It was found that O2 molecules can be chemisorbed on the 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer to form adsorbate-O2*; however, this cannot be achieved on 2H-MoTe2 after structure optimization. Because similar OOH* adsorption energies were identified in both MoTe2 systems, we assumed that the free energy change of O2* formation on 2H-MoTe2 is the same as that of 1T′-MoTe2. The third and fourth steps are electrochemical steps corresponding to OOH* and H2O2 formation, respectively. The rate equation of each species was computed using the following equations: (8) ∂x O2(dl) = k 1 x O2(aq) – k –1 x O2(dl) – k 2 x O2(dl) θ* + k –2 θ O2* (9) ∂θ*/∂t = k 4 θ OOH* – k –4 θ*x H2O2 – k 2 x O2(dl) θ* + k –2 θ O2* (10) ∂θ O2*/∂t = k 2 x O2(dl) θ* – k –2 θ O2* – k 3 θ O2* + k –3 θ OOH* (11) ∂θ OOH*/∂t = k 3 θ O2* – k –3 θ OOH* – k 4 θ OOH* + k –4 x H2O2 θ* where x is the mole fraction and θ is the coverage. x O2(aq) was taken as 2.34 × 10−5, corresponding to O2 gas in equilibrium with O2(aq) at 1 atm. It was found that x H2O2 has a negligible influence on the model polarization curve and was set to 1 × 10−5. The density of active Te atoms on the basal plane of the 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer was 9.31 × 1014 cm−2. We assumed that half of the active Te sites are involved in catalysis, thereby leading to eρ Te = 74.5 μC cm−2. The O2 diffusion rate was taken as 8.6 × 105 s−1, which provides a diffusion-limited current density of 3 mA cm−2 at a rotation speed of 1600 r/min. The basic methodology for microkinetic modeling has been described elsewhere [42–44]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer structural properties Fig. 1(a) shows the optimized structure of the 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer. A single unit cell of 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer consisted of two Mo atoms and four Te atoms. The equilibrium lattice parameters of the 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer were optimized to a = 6.33 Å and b = 3.48 Å, consistent with the previously reported values [45]. In the 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer, Mo atoms are coordinated by Te atoms at the corners of distorted octahedra which is in sharp contrast to 2H-MoTe2 wherein each Mo atom is coordinated by six Te atoms located at the corners of trigonal prisms. The distortion of the octahedra significantly buckles the Te atomic layers, resulting in two types of Te with inequivalent coordination, namely the high-buckled (TeI) and the low-buckled (TeII) Te, respectively. Remarkably, the lengths of the Mo–TeI bonds (~2.75 Å) are much shorter than those of the Mo-TeII bonds (~2.85 Å). According to Bader charge population analysis, Mo, TeI, and TeII atoms in the 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer possess charges of 0.44, –0.21, and –0.23|e|, respectively. Although 1T′-MoTe2 monolayers have been synthesized using CVD and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), it is still necessary to find a method that can realize the large-scale production of 1T′-MoTe2 monolayers in order to promote its application in the field of catalysis. Experimentally, mechanical exfoliation and liquid exfoliation are the most commonly used techniques for producing single- or few-layered 2D structures from the bulk. To investigate the feasibility of producing a 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer via exfoliation techniques, we computed the cleavage energy (E cl) of 1T′-MoTe2 by isolating one layer from a five-layer structure of the 1T′-MoTe2 slab and fixing the remaining four layers thereafter. The total energy under variation of the separation distance (d) between the two components was then computed. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the E cl of 1T′-MoTe2 first increases with increasing separation distance and then converges to ~0.45 J/m2 when the separation distance is larger than 6 Å. Remarkably, the determined E cl of 1T′-MoTe2 is comparable to computations at the same theoretical levels for some recently exfoliated 2D structures, e.g. graphene (0.37 J/m2) and MoS2 (0.42 J/m2) [46]; this indicated that interlayer interactions in 1T′-MoTe2 are rather weak and that it would be quite feasible to produce the 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer via exfoliation techniques. It is noteworthy that the 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer exhibits good kinetic stability (Fig. S1) and thermodynamic stability (Fig. S2). 3.2 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer electronic properties The activity of an electrocatalyst is intrinsically associated with the binding strength of its key reaction intermediate, which is fundamentally governed by the electronic structure. In order to gain a preliminary understanding of the catalytic properties of the 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer, we studied its electronic properties by computing its band structure. As shown in Fig. S3, the 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer computed at the HSE level of theory is semi-metallic with two energy bands crossing at a point along the Γ-M path. Because Mo and Te may have considerable spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects, we also computed the SOC-corrected band structure for the 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer. Remarkably, the degeneracy at the crossing point is lifted in the presence of SOC, leading to the opening of a small bandgap of 9 meV for the 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer. These results are in good agreement with previous theoretical computations and experimental observations [45,47]. Overall, the reasonably good electrical conductivity of the 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer would be beneficial to its electrocatalytic activity. 3.3 Electrochemical activity of 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer toward 2e-ORR Next, we investigated the catalytic activity of the 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer for the electroreduction of O2 to H2O2. Generally, the electroreduction of O2 to H2O2 involves two elementary steps: the reduction of O2 to OOH* (a key intermediate) via proton-coupled electron transfer, followed by further hydrogenation of OOH* to H2O2 (Figs. 2(a) and (c) ). According to previous studies, the adsorption free energy of OOH* species (ΔG OOH*) is a good descriptor for evaluating the activity of an electrocatalyst toward 2e-ORR. The optimal value of ΔG OOH* should be 4.22 eV, which can bring about a facile reaction path at the equilibrium potential of 0.7 V (Fig. 2(b)) [15]. Correspondingly, the theoretical overpotential (η t) can be further deduced using the equation |ΔG OOH*/e – 4.22 V|. ΔG OOH* for PtHg4 (a well-established 2e-ORR catalyst) was determined to be ~4.28 eV [15], whereas the OOH* adsorption on typical 4e-ORR catalysts (e.g., ΔG OOH* = 3.98 eV for Pt and ΔG OOH* = 3.87 eV for Pd) is considerably strong. We then computed the ΔG OOH* of 1T'-MoTe2 by first identifying ORR active sites. The SOC effect was included in these computations, and its energy contribution to ΔG OOH* was determined to be 0.02 eV. Please note that the solvent effect is essential for describing electrochemical reactions at water-solid interfaces. It was found that OOH* adsorbed on the 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer is stabilized by ~0.15 eV when considering the solvent effect. As described above, there are two types of Te sites on the basal plane of the 1T'-MoTe2 monolayer. The high-buckled TeI was first excluded as the active site for ORR, as the OOH* species spontaneously moved to the neighboring TeII site after a full atomic relaxation (Fig. 2(a)). According to our computations, under an equilibrium potential of 0.7 V, the formation of the OOH* intermediate over a TeII site of the 1T'-MoTe2 monolayer is slightly uphill (0.02 eV) as can be seen from the free-energy diagram (Fig. 2(b)); its G OOH* is calculated to be 4.24 eV, which is even superior to that of the PtHg4 catalyst [15]. The formed OOH* species can be easily transformed into H2O2 (Fig. 2(c)), which is downhill by 0.02 eV in the free-energy diagram. Therefore, the 1T'-MoTe2 monolayer can provide a rather high limiting potential of 0.68 V when severed as the electrocatalyst of 2e-ORR. We have also assessed the edge activity of the 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer but found that its edge sites are inactive to facilitate 2e-ORR owing to the strong OOH* adsorption (ΔG OOH* = 3.85 eV). However, the excellent 2e-ORR activity of the 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer can still be expected because of the high concentration of active sites that are exposed on its basal plane. To obtain fundamental insights into the distinguished catalytic activity of TeI and TeII sites, we also computed the partial density of states (DOS) and plotted the p-band centers (ε p) for both types of Te atoms. As shown in Fig. 2(d), the p-band center of the TeII site (–2.77 eV) is closer to the Fermi level than that of the TeI site (–3.09 eV). In principle, a higher electronic state enhances the interaction between the active site and the adsorbate, thereby leading to a stronger binding strength. These results explain why the TeII atoms, rather than the TeI atoms, are ORR active sites. Moreover, we constructed a microkinetic model of 2e-ORR to qualitatively describe the performance of the 1T-MoTe2 monolayer. A non-precious 2e-ORR catalyst in acids, i.e., 2H-MoTe2, was simulated for comparison. Computed at the same theoretical levels, the ΔG OOH* on the edge-Te sites of 2H-MoTe2 is 4.27 eV, which is slightly more positive than that of the 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer (4.24 eV). The polarization curves of 2e-ORR on 1T′-MoTe2 and 2H-MoTe2 can be obtained by numerically solving the rate equations of the reaction species at steady state (Fig. 3 ). According to our simulations, the theoretical onset potential of 2H-MoTe2 was determined to be ~0.59 V, which is in reasonable agreement with experimental measurements (~0.56 V) [29]. Remarkably, the 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer exhibits a quite positive onset potential of ~0.62 V, corresponding to an overpotential of 80 meV. This performance is also slightly superior to that of a state-of-the-art PtHg4 catalyst [15]. 3.4 Electrochemical selectivity of the 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer toward ORR With the elucidation of the catalytic activity of the 1T'-MoTe2 monolayer, we investigated its selectivity for 2e-ORR through kinetic analysis. In principle, OOH* protonation determines the 2e/4e selectivity of an ORR catalyst, as it can facilitate the formation of (1) H2O2 or (2) adsorbed O* species in addition to H2O. The former represents the end product of 2e-ORR, while the latter is part of a key reaction step of 4e-ORR. Because a proton can attach to either the former or the latter O species of the intermediate OOH* (which can be treated as an “–O–OH” configuration), a simple structural analysis, wherein the proton was modeled as a H3O+ ion near OOH*, was performed first (Fig. 4 ). It was found that the H3O+ ion is preferentially close to the former O species of OOH* and spontaneously loses a proton to form a desorbed H2O2 molecule, leaving a H2O molecule. A similar preference has been found in a single-atom 2e-ORR catalyst [48]. After determining the preference of H3O+ attached to OOH* over the 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer, we calculated the kinetic barrier of OOH* protonation using a hybrid solvent approach that contained one layer of water and a H3O+ ion in tandem using an implicit–explicit solvation model (Fig. S4). Herein, a supercell (2 × 5 × 1) of the 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer was adopted to achieve a small lattice mismatch with the water layer. The SOC effect was not included in the kinetic analysis because of the high computational cost of this slab model. Remarkably, as shown in Fig. 5 , the kinetic barrier of the H2O2 formation step for the 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer is 0.49 eV, which is much lower than that of the competing O* formation step (0.78 eV). From a kinetics perspective, the 2e pathway is more favorable than the 4e pathway, and the 1T-MoTe2 monolayer would have a relatively high selectivity for 2e-ORR. In addition, the 2e-ORR selectivity of the 1T-MoTe2 monolayer can also be seen in Fig. S5, which shows that the 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer is located on the right side of a volcano plot (where ΔG OOH* is more positive than the ideal value of 4.22 eV), i.e., the 2e-ORR-dominated region [15]. We have also performed a microkinetic analysis to provide an intuitive demonstration of the 2e selectivity. As shown in Fig. S6, the partial current density of H2O2 is at least two orders of magnitude higher than that of H2O over a typical potential range, which reveals the dominance of the 2e pathway over the 4e pathway. 4 Conclusions We systematically studied the electronic, structural, and catalytic properties of a 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer using DFT computations and microkinetic modeling. Our computations demonstrated that the 1T'-MoTe2 monolayer has good stability and has great potential to be produced via exfoliation techniques because of its low cleavage energy. The basal plane of the 1T'-MoTe2 monolayer displays two types of Te sites, i.e., TeI and TeII, of which the latter exhibits favorable OOH* binding energy. Importantly, kinetics computations reveal that the active TeII sites prefer to facilitate the reduction of OOH* to H2O2 over the competing formation of O* + H2O, corresponding to a relatively high 2e-ORR selectivity. Because of these desirable characteristics, we are optimistic that 1T′-MoTe2 monolayers can be used as a high-performance 2e-ORR catalysts in the near future. This study sheds light on the rational design of surface-active non-precious-metal-based catalysts for the electrochemical production of H2O2.

        "dc:description": "The direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via a two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e-ORR) in acidic media has emerged as a green process for the production of this valuable chemical. However, such an approach employs expensive noble-metal-based electrocatalysts, which severely undermines its feasibility when implemented on an industrial scale. Herein, based on density functional theory computations and microkinetic modeling, we demonstrate that a novel two-dimensional (2D) material, namely a 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer, can serve as an efficient non-precious electrocatalyst to facilitate the 2e-ORR. The 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer is a stable 2D crystal that can be easily produced through exfoliation techniques. The surface-exposed Te sites of the 1T′-MoTe2 monolayer exhibit a favorable OOH* binding energy of 4.24 eV, resulting in a rather high basal plane activity toward the 2e-ORR. Importantly, kinetic computations indicate that the 1T'-MoTe2 monolayer preferentially promotes the formation of H2O2 over the competing four-electron ORR step. These desirable characteristics render 1T′-MoTe2 a promising candidate for catalyzing the electrochemical reduction of O2 to H2O2.",
