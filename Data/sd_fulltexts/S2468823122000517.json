Active electrocatalysts are the key of water splitting for hydrogen production through the electrolysis. In this paper, Ni foams substrates as templates, self-supporting ternary alloy catalyst was prepared by one step at room temperature. Growth mechanism of self-supporting ternary alloy catalyst is explored by growth process. Micro-current technology of galvanic reaction and the principle of interface electric double layer reaction are important to the self-supporting ternary alloy catalyst. Their catalytic activity was evaluated by electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution(HER). It exhibits excellent HER properties with a overpotential (17 mV) and small Tafel slope (10.2 mVdec−1). Their enhanced performances in HER catalysts can be mainly attributed to ternary alloy catalysts structure, which allows the appearance synergistic effects and larger specific surface area. This research is to control the micro-area of chemical reaction at the atomic level by non-precious template and all kinds of precursor mixture solution. Graphical abstract Self-supporting ternary alloy catalyst was prepared by one-step galvanic replacement. They display exerlent superior activity for the HER in base solution with an onset reduction potential of + 17 mV vs RHE and small Tafel slope (10.2 mVdec−1). This activity is due to the synergistic effects and larger specific surface area. Image, graphical abstract . Keywords Metal self-support Ni Primary battery Hydrogen evolution Ternary alloy catalysts Introduction Hydrogen energy, as a non-polluting and renewable clean energy, has many outstanding advantages such as abundant resources and easy storage [1–4,]. As a raw material for hydrogen production, water is abundant and renewable in nature, which provides the possibility for sustainable hydrogen production. Hydrogen production from water has the advantages of reliable technology, no need of separation operation, easy to obtain high purity gas. However, the bottleneck of application of hydrogen production by water electrolysis is the high cost. In order to reduce the overpotential of cathode for hydrogen production from water and save energy consumption, the research on cathode materials with low overpotential and high catalytic activity is the focus of hydrogen evolution catalyst [5,6]. Precious metal platinum-based material is the best catalyst for hydrogen production. Because of low reserves and high price. It is limited in practical production and application for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Therefore, developing non-noble metal or lesser noble metal catalysts is an effective measure to reduce the cost hydrogen evolution. Among these low-cost, eco-friendly, and efficient HER catalysts [7–10], binary or multicomponent metal catalyst are particularly attractive [11,12]. As the research of non-noble metal or lesser noble metal catalysts hydrogen evolution materials, nickel-based hydrogen evolution catalyst materials is the hotspot, especially nickel-based binary alloy catalysts represented by Raney Ni alloy electrode. However, the problems of insufficient stability and catalytic activity, the development of other types of multi-alloy hydrogen evolution electrodes is the focus of recent research [13–15]. So, the research and development of nickel-based functional catalyst are of great scientific significance [16–19], both for the synthesis technology of catalyst and the large-scale development and utilization of hydrogen energy. In recent years, due to the abundant surface resources and high electrocatalytic activity of metallic nickel, people have done a lot of research on the application of metallic Ni catalyst for hydrogen evolution. Duye Shu et al. successfully synthesized ultrafine monodisperse bimetallic NiPt nanoparticles with different compositions by corelating nickel acetylacetonate, platinum acetylacetonate and borane-tert-butylamine in oleylamine. Among all these catalysts, Ni84Pt16/graphene exhibited 100% hydrogen selectivity and high catalytic activity. Ni2P nanosheets/foam Ni composites as non-noble metal electrocatalysts were prepared by using Ni foam surface oxidation as precursor and trioctylphosphine with low concentration as phosphorus source. Further research shows the oxide layer of Ni foam can orient the formation of Ni2P nanosheets and promote the reaction with TOP. Ni2P/Ni, as a powerful 3D self-supporting cathode for hydrogen decomposition, which has shown excellent catalytic performance, stability and durability in aqueous medium at a wide pH value, making it a general hydrogen generation catalyst system [20–24]. These materials with high activity, stability, abundance and low cost can be used in catalysis. The field of energy conversion and storage has great potential application prospect [25–27]. All the above methods have prepared catalysts with good electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance, but they all need certain experimental conditions: amine-based reducing agent, adding a proper amount of surfactant, and high temperature in the reaction process. In this paper, we improved the experimental conditions, and also added platinum acetylacetonate and palladium acetylacetonate metal precursors, and prepared high-performance self-supported nickel-based heterojunction electrocatalysts at room temperature. The electrochemical hydrogen evolution performance is evaluated, and it has excellent electrocatalytic performance [28–30]. The research work will further expand the application range of galvanic cell micro-current method in catalyst preparation, and have practical significance for green design and scale development of new functional catalysts. Experimental section Experimental method (1) Metal substrate treatment and samples collection method. The 1 × 2 cm foam Ni was soaked in dilute acetic acid to remove oxides and other impurities on the surface, washed with ultrapure water and absolute ethanol for three times, respectively, treated the metal surface soaked in the prepared precursor solution before being oxidized. The precursor solution including copper chloride (5 × 10−2 M), 7 mg platinum acetylacetonate and 7 mg palladium acetylacetonate. Then sealed with plastic wrap. After growing for a certain time at room temperature, sucked the precipitate with a straw, put it in absolute ethyl alcohol, centrifugally washed it for several times, and put it in an oven at 60 °C to dry, obtain a powdery product. The concentration of acetic acid (6 M) is diluted to 0.1 M. The nickel foam is placed in solution for 15 min at room temperature. The grown metal substrate is ultrasonically treated for one minute, rinsed clean with ultrapure water, and dried to obtain the self-supporting multi-component catalyst structure on the metal surface. Experimental instruments (1) X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was taken by bruker axd8 x-ray diffractometer, which operated at 30 kV voltage and 40 Ka current, and had Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 nm). (2) The morphology and elemental distribution of the composite were observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) JEOL JMS6390-LV, equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) and operated at 15 kV acceleration voltage. (3) Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) images were tested on JEOL JEM 2100PLUS instrument with an accelerated voltage of 160 kV. Electrochemical hydrogen evolution test conditions The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance was tested on an Autolab (potentiostat PGSTAT-302 N) at room temperature. In this experiment, a three-electrode system was used. in 1.0 M KOH solution, Hg/HgO was used as reference electrode, Pt wire electrode (1 cm2 was used as counter electrode, and Cu-Cu2O/Pt/Pd composite film supported on Cu foil was used as working electrode (1 × 1cm2. All electromotive forces mentioned in this paper are converted into reversible hydrogen electrodes (RHE), According to nernst equation transformation, such as: ERHE = EHg/HgO + 0.098 + 0.0591 × pH ERHE is the electrode potential converted to RHE, EHg/HgO is the potential measured using Hg/HgO as the reference electrode. Before the experiment, the electrolyte was ventilated with saturated Ar gas for 20 min, then the oxygen in the solution was discharged, so that the solution reached argon saturation. Results and disscussion In the experiment, we found that the anions of bivalent copper ions-sulfate ions and chloride ions have great influence on the growth of cuprous oxide, especially the microscopic morphology, sample color. Fig. 1 shows the difference between the ions-sulfate and ions-chloride. Firstly, the sample color is red in CuCl2 solution (Fig. 1 a1), After platinum acetylacetonate, palladium acetylacetonate and platinum acetylacetonate and palladium acetylacetonate mixture were one by one added, sample color is being turn blue (Fig. 1 a2–a4). And the sample color is brown in CuSO4 solution (Fig. 1 b1), After series precursor solution were added one by one, the sample being turn blue in CuSO4 solution too (Fig. 1 b2–b4). Then, the morphology of sample. The size is bigger in CuCl2 (Fig. 1 A1, about 2 μm) than that in CuSO4 (Fig. 1 B1, about 800 nm). After platinum acetylacetonate, palladium acetylacetonate and platinum acetylacetonate and palladium acetylacetonate mixture were added one by one, the complex in CuCl2 solution became nanosheet (Fig. 1 A2), and aggregated into 3 μm balls (Fig. 1 A4). The complex in CuSO4 solution, their morphologies changed to a certain extent. After platinum acetylacetonate and palladium acetylacetonate mixture were added, the complex is in CuSO4 solution became pin-like in the surface (Fig. 1 B4). At the same time, the elemental composition of the corresponding sample was tested by XPS in Table 1 . XPS elemental analysis of the sample compound film grown in copper chloride (Fig. 2 ) shows that platinum, palladium or simultaneous doping of platinum and palladium can be realized in cuprous oxide matrix, However, the doping amount of noble metal in copper chloride is higher than that in copper sulfate solution. The content of elements tested by ICP-OES is shown in the Table S1. The content and change trend of each element are consistent with the test results of XPS. In order to further study the composition of the complex, XRD spectra of nickel foams loading different noble metals in CuCl2 solution and CuSO4 solution of 5 × 10−3 M (supporting information S1). The results show the sample has the same peak position in these two solutions. All the diffraction peaks in the picture are consistent with the peaks of Cu (JCPDS No.04–8336) and Cu2O (JCPDS No.05–0667). All the diffraction peaks can be attributed to Cu and Cu2O, which proves that the addition of noble metals does not tested. In contrast, the peak of Cu2O is obvious, and the peak intensity is also more significantly improved in CuCl2 solution than in CuSO4 solution. For further exploration element composition of these two samples, XPS measurements were carried out. XPS quantitative results confirmed that precious metals in the composite. Obviously, the precious metal content is higher in CuCl2 solution than in CuSO4 solution. During the test, the surface contamination C1s(284.8 eV) was taken as the standard for correction. Fig. S1 shows the high resolution narrow spectrum and XPS full spectrum of Cu 2p, O 1 s, Pt 4f and Pd 3d in CuCl2 solution. In the high-resolution narrow spectrum of Cu 2p, the two main peaks at about 932 eV and 952 eV belong to Cu 2p 3/2 and Cu 2p 1/2, which are typical monovalent copper and zero valent copper. The asymmetry of peak at 932 eV indicates that there are multiple valence copper in the sample, such as 954 eV peak and 934 eV peak of shoulder peak of Cu 2p 3/2 peak, indicating that there is residual divalent copper in the solution. The peak position of oxygen at about 531 eV can be attributed to metal and oxygen in cuprous oxide. Two groups of peaks appeared in Pt 4f and Pd 3d A group of Pt 4f 7/2 at 71 eV and Pt 4f 5/2 at 74 eV, Pd 3d 3/2 at 335 eV and Pd 3d 5/2 at 340 eV, the values are consistent with Pt0 and Pd0, respectively. In the other group, Pt 4f 5/2 is at 77 eV, Pd 3d 3/2 is at 337 eV and Pd 3d 5/2 is at 342 eV, which is consistent with the reported bivalent platinum and bivalent palladium in the literature [31,32]. Fig. 2 shows the doping of noble metal on nickel substrate in copper chloride solution, and the XPS information of heterostructure in copper sulfate solution is the supporting information S3, and the XPS results information of in both CuCl2 and CuSO4 solution are consistent. Furthermore, the structure of samples in CuCl2 solution was characterized by SEM and TEM (Fig. 3 ). The results show that the composite is a microsphere composed of nanosheets with a diameter of about 5 μm. From the high-resolution transmission electron microscope, Cu and Cu2O have a clear boundary and they are heterogeneous structures. And the composite has high crystallinity, lattice stripes with different directions can be clearly seen, which shows the high-density nano-contact between nanosheets and indicates the polycrystalline nature of nanosheets. The interplanar spacing of 0.246 nm corresponds to the (100) crystal plane of Cu2O and 0.217 nm corresponds to the (111) crystal plane of Cu. The diffraction ring in the illustration also proves that the composite is highly crystalline and has a polycrystalline structure of face centered cubic (fcc). Energy dispersive spectrometer (EDX) is an effective means for qualitative measurement of unknown compounds, and can also be used for semi-quantitative detection of element content. According to EDX-mapping and data analysis of the composite, the content of precious metals on the surface of the composite is far higher than that inside the composite, which indicates that precious metals are mainly supported on the surface of Cu-Cu2O element distribution mapping further confirmed that platinum and palladium particles were uniformly distributed in the composite. In summary, according to the measured element and structural information, the samples grown on foam nickel are made up of Cu, Pt, Pd and Cu2O. So it is named Cu-Cu2O-PtPd composite. According to the experimental results and the heterogeneous structure of the samples, we speculate the growth mechanism of the samples by one-step reaction with multiple galvanic cells (Fig. 5 ). At first, Cu2+in copper chloride or copper sulfate solution reacts with nickel substrate. At the same time, the replaced copper reacts with Cu2+in the solution to produce cuprous oxide product [33–36]. It should be emphasized the formation of intermediate cuprous oxide, its existence has been explained by experiments and corresponding chemical reaction mechanism [37–39]. Ni+ Cu2+ = Ni2+ + Cu Response1 Cu+Cu2++ H2O = Cu2O+2H+ Response2 Pt(acac)2+Cu2O=Cu2++Pt+2acac- Response3 Pd(acac)2+ Cu2O = Cu2+ + Pd + 2acac- Response 4. Two kinds of Cu-Cu2O/PtPd composite films grown in copper chloride and copper sulfate solutions were used as working electrodes, Cu-Cu2O, Cu-Cu2O/Pt, Cu-Cu2O/Pd, and Cu-Cu2O/PtPd prepared in CuCl2 solution and CuSO4 solution were studied in 1.0 M KOH solution saturated with argon gas. As a comparative catalyst, Ni foam was tested under the same conditions. The HER performance of different catalysts was studied by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves. Generally, the activity of electrocatalysts is described by the overpotential (η10) when the current density is 10 mA cm−2. As shown in Fig. 6 , from the polarization curve, the lowest overpotential (absolute value) of Cu-Cu2O/PtPd thin films prepared in CuCl2 solution is 0.017 V, followed by Cu-Cu2O/Pt thin films in CuCl2 solution (0.035 V). In CuSO4 solution, Cu-Cu2O/PtPd thin film (0.065 V) has much better catalytic activity than Cu-Cu2O thin film (0.172 V) and pure nickel foam (0.452 V) without noble metal. It can also be seen from the histogram (Fig. 6B) that the overpotential of Cu-Cu2O/PtPd thin films prepared in CuCl2 solution is the lowest. In addition, Tafel curve is obtained from LSV curve based on Tafel equation (η = b log j+a, j is current density and b is Tafel slope). As shown in Fig. 6C, the minimum slope of Cu-Cu2O/PtPd film is 9.03 mv dec−1, while that of Cu-Cu2O/Pt film is 9.26 mV dec−1, which is obviously lower than that of pure nickel foam (36.1 mV dec−1). The smaller the slope, the faster the kinetic rate of HER catalysis, indicating that Cu-Cu2O/PtPd thin films have the fastest kinetic rate. The stability of catalyst is also a very important factor to evaluate the catalytic effect. In the stability test, 1000 CVs scans were performed at a constant scanning speed of 100 mV/s to study HER stability of Cu-Cu2O/PtPd composite films. As shown in Fig. 6D, after the cyclic scanning, the two LSV curves at the beginning and the end basically coincide, and the current density basically does not change. The test results show that the micro-spherical Cu-Cu2O/PtPd composite film has good electrocatalytic stability. Under the same conditions, the electrocatalytic activity of heterojunction composite products grown in copper chloride solution is obviously higher than that grown in copper sulfate solution. This may be related to ternary alloy catalysts structure, which allows the appearance synergistic effects and larger specific surface area. Because of reducing electron-hole recombination, it has been widely proved doping of metal in semiconductor could enhance semiconductor photocatalytic [40], hotoluminescence [41], magnetic and optical properties [42]. As the Fermi level of Pd and pt is lower than the conduction band (CB) of Cu2O, such charge transfer greatly ecreases the likelihood of electron−hole recombination to enhance the catalytic activity [43]. Conclusion Cu-Cu2O, Cu-Cu2O/Pt, Cu-Cu2O/Pd, and Cu-Cu2O/PtPd composite films catalysts were synthesized by one step displacement reaction, the morphology of the composite can be accurately controlled by adjusting the concentration of copper ions and anions in the solution. XRD, SEM, XPS, HRTEM and EDX-Mapping were used to study the structure, morphology and electrocatalytic performance of the catalyst. The results show that the heterogeneous Cu-Cu2O composite film loaded with PtPd greatly improves the hydrogen evolution performance. In this paper, the preparation process of the composite film is simple and green, which does not need to add surfactants and reducing agents. The preparation process does not need special equipment, and it is easy for large-scale preparation. Moreover, the prepared product does not need complex post-treatment, and can be directly used as a functional catalyst electrode for catalytic hydrogen evolution experiment. The functional electrode has another advantage: the base foam material is firmly combined with cuprous oxide on the surface, the porous foam material increases the contact area with electrolyte, has good conductivity and effectively improves the active sites. Compared with pure foam nickel, Cu-Cu2O thin film, Cu2O/Pt composite thin film and Cu2O/Pd composite thin film, the Cu-Cu2O/PtPd composite thin film catalyst prepared by this process has greatly reduced hydrogen evolution overpotential. Because of synergistic effects and larger specific surface area, Cu-Cu2O/PtPd composite in CuCl2 solution shows superior electrochemical hydrogen evolution performance. The catalyst still has good stability after scanning the cycle curve for 1000 cycles. CRediT authorship contribution statement Hong Zhao: Conceptualization, Methodology, Software.

        "dc:description": "Active electrocatalysts are the key of water splitting for hydrogen production through the electrolysis. In this paper, Ni foams substrates as templates, self-supporting ternary alloy catalyst was prepared by one step at room temperature. Growth mechanism of self-supporting ternary alloy catalyst is explored by growth process. Micro-current technology of galvanic reaction and the principle of interface electric double layer reaction are important to the self-supporting ternary alloy catalyst. Their catalytic activity was evaluated by electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution(HER). It exhibits excellent HER properties with a overpotential (17 mV) and small Tafel slope (10.2 mVdec−1). Their enhanced performances in HER catalysts can be mainly attributed to ternary alloy catalysts structure, which allows the appearance synergistic effects and larger specific surface area. This research is to control the micro-area of chemical reaction at the atomic level by non-precious template and all kinds of precursor mixture solution.",
