Therefore, in this work, Cu2S was loaded onto g-C3N4 nanosheets by in situ deposition, and a series of Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 p-n heterojunctions were prepared by varying the loading amount of Cu2S. The photocatalytic performance test results showed that the best photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of 10% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 reached 197 μmolg−1h−1, which was 11.4 times that of pure Nv-C3N4 and 47.5 times that of pure Cu2S. The enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the formation of Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 p-n heterojunction, which effectively promotes the separation and transfer of photogenerated electron-hole and enhances light absorption. This work constructs a novel type of C3N4 heterojunction composite, which provides a new way to improve the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance of C3N4.

Therefore, there is a need to develop clean and renewable new energy sources to solve the above problems. Hydrogen energy is considered an effective alternative to fossil fuels due to its high calorific value, convenient storage and easy recycling [3]. Among the many ways to produce hydrogen, the photocatalytic decomposition of water to produce hydrogen has received widespread attention as a sustainable technology that uses inexhaustible solar energy to decompose water to produce hydrogen gas. Among them, an efficient and stable photocatalyst is the key to realising the conversion of solar energy into hydrogen energy. After years of research, many semiconductor materials have been used in photocatalytic hydrogen production, such as metal oxides [4], sulfides [5], nitrides [6] and so on. However, most semiconductor photocatalyst are only responsive to UV light (only 5% of sunlight) [7] due to their wide band gap and are subject to photocorrosion [8], resulting in low visible light utilisation and poor stability, leading to their unsatisfactory photocatalytic activity. In 2009, Wang et al. [9] first reported a new non-metallic semiconductor polymer, graphitic phase carbon nitride (g-C3N4). It has been widely used in photocatalytic hydrogen production due to its advantages as a n-type semiconductor with a narrow forbidden band width (∼2.7 eV), suitable conduction band edges, good stability as well as non-toxicity and low cost [10–12]. However, pure carbon nitride still has many drawbacks, such as high photogenerated electron-hole complexation rate, narrow visible light absorption range and poor electrical conductivity, which seriously affect its photocatalytic hydrogen production performance [13–16]. To overcome these problems, researchers have modified conventional carbon nitride by elemental doping [17], morphology modulation [18], co-catalyst loading [19] and heterojunction construction [20]. Among them, the construction of heterojunction with other semiconductors can inhibit the complexation of photogenerated carriers, broaden the light absorption range and effectively enhance the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4. Xu et al. [21] loaded Co3O4 onto polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) by impregnation to construct S-type heterojunction, which exhibited strong photoresponse and rapid separation and migration of photogenerated charge pairs, and showed better hydrogen precipitation. Sun's team [22] prepared a low-cost, high-efficiency Cu3P/g-C3N4 photocatalyst by a one-step in situ solvothermal method. Compared with pure g-C3N4, the hydrogen production performance was significantly improved, mainly due to the growth of Cu3P nanoparticles on g-C3N4 nanosheets, which formed a heterogeneous structure and increased the active sites and close contact interfaces, greatly facilitating the separation and transport of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Copper-based sulfur compounds are high-performance materials that have attracted much attention from the scientific community due to their promising commercial applications in biosensors, photocatalysts and rechargeable batteries. Among them, Cu2S, as a p-type semiconductor with a narrow bandgap (∼1.2 eV) [23], has excellent optoelectronic properties, low cost and good visible light absorption, and its reduction potential can meet the requirements of photocatalytic hydrogen precipitation reactions, making it an ideal co-catalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen precipitation, and is often used to construct p-n-type heterojunctions [24–26]. Zhang's group [27] synthesised novel snowflake-like Cu2S/Zn0.5Cd0.5S heterojunction photocatalysts. The synthesised Cu2S/Zn0.5Cd0.5S exhibited significantly enhanced H2 precipitation rates compared to pure Cu2S and Zn0.5Cd0.5S. The experimental results suggest that the enhanced H2 precipitation rate can be attributed to the formation of p-n heterojunction between Cu2S and Zn0.5Cd0.5S, which effectively facilitates the separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers. Meanwhile, Guan's group [28] developed a novel Cu2S-coupled S-doped TiO2 p-n heterostructure, which exhibited an efficient H2 production rate without loading any noble metal co-catalyst. In addition, the formation of composite photocatalytic systems of Cu2S with other semiconducting materials to improve the efficiency of hydrogen production has also been reported. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are very few reports on Cu2S and g-C3N4 composites. Therefore, the preparation of Cu2S/g-C3N4 composites and the study of their photocatalytic hydrogen production performance are of great importance. In the present work, Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 p-n heterojunction materials were prepared by loading Cu2S on g-C3N4 nanosheets by in situ deposition, and the effect on their photocatalytic hydrogen production performance was investigated by varying the loading of Cu2S. It was found that 10% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 gave the best performance, reaching 197 μmolg−1h−1, compared to pure Nv-C3N4 by a factor of 11. Through a series of characterisations, it was demonstrated that the formation of Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 p-n heterojunction significantly reduces the complexation of photogenerated carriers and facilitates the transfer of photogenerated charges at the catalyst interface. In addition, this work further explores the photochemical properties and intrinsic mechanism of Cu2S/Nv-C3N4. This work improves the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of the catalyst itself by simple means, giving it greater potential for development in the field of photocatalytic hydrogen production. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials The chemicals used in the experiments were all of analytical purity grade and were not further purified. Dicyandiamide (C2H4N4), urea (CH4N2O), ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), anhydrous ethylenediamine (C2H8N2), copper chloride dihydrate (CuCl2·2H2O), thiourea (CH4N2S). 2.2 Preparation of Nv-C3N4 Nv-C3N4 was prepared using dicyandiamide as a precursor and NH4Cl as a gaseous template to produce g-C3N4 nanosheets. A dry mixture was obtained by dissolving 6 g of dicyandiamide and 30 g of NH4Cl in 200 mL of deionised water, stirring continuously in an oil bath and evaporating at 80 °C. The mixture was then removed, ground and placed in a covered crucible and calcined in a muffle furnace at 1 °C/min to 550 °C for 4 h. 2.3 Preparation of Cu2S 0.341 g CuCl2 and 0.456 g (NH4)2CS were placed in 60 mL of ethylenediamine solvent and stirred for 2 h before being placed in a reaction vessel at 80 °C for 8 h. The reaction was carried out at room temperature in centrifuge tubes, washed by centrifugation (twice with deionised water and three times with ethanol) and dried in an oven at 60 °C. 2.4 Preparation of Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 Different mass ratios of Nv-C3N4 and Cu2S were weighed, dissolved in 30 mL of ethanol and sonicated for 10 min, then stirred for 24 h. The mass ratios of Cu2S and Nv-C3N4 were 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt%, respectively, and the preparation process is shown in Fig. 1. 2.5 Materials characterisation The material phase of the material was analysed using a D8 ADVANCE diffractometer to obtain an X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum using Cu Kα as the radiation line source. The scanning range was 10–70° and the scanning speed was 5°/min. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to study the microscopic morphology of the material. The chemical composition of the samples and the chemical changes that occurred were analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to identify and analyse the characteristic functional groups present in the sample. The light absorption properties of the prepared materials were tested using UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–vis DRS). Photoluminescence (PL) testing of the solid catalysts was carried out using a HITACHIF-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 330 nm. 2.6 Photoelectrochemical testing The CHI660E workstation with a conventional three-electrode structure was used for the test with Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, a platinum electrode as the counter electrode and the sample as the working electrode. Prior to testing, 5 mg of sample was weighed, 270 μL ethanol, 200 μL deionised water and 30 μL naphthol were added, sonicated and dispersed well, then the mixture was applied to a 1 × 1 cm FTO conductive glass, dried and used as the working electrode. The electrochemical impedance, Schottky and photocurrent tests were carried out using a 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution as the electrolyte solution and the EIS was tested over a frequency range of 1 Hz to 1000 kHz. The Schottky test frequencies are 500 Hz, 1000 Hz and 1500 Hz. The light source for the photocurrent test is a 300 W Xenon lamp (The average irradiance was 35.5 mW/cm2, and the area was 8.91 cm2) with an output wavelength greater than 420 nm. 2.7 Photocatalytic performance testing 10 mg of catalyst was placed in a 50 mL quartz tube, 2 mL of triethanolamine and 8 mL of water were added, the tube was sealed and the catalyst was uniformly dispersed using an ultrasonicator. The sealed quartz tube was filled with Ar gas for 30 min to remove all air. The sealed quartz tube was then placed on a stirrer and irradiated with a 300 W xenon lamp (CEL-HXF300-T3) with an output wavelength greater than 420 nm for 3 h at a distance of 10 cm from the reactor. Gas samples were taken at 1 h intervals and injected into a gas chromatograph (Panopticon A91) using argon as the carrier gas and detected by a thermal conductivity detector. Finally, the hydrogen production rate of the prepared material is calculated according to the relevant equation: umol g−1 h−1 = (ppm*V)/(22·4 L/mol*m*h) V: volume of quartz tube; m: mass of catalyst; h: exposure time. The volume of the quartz tube in the equation is 50 mL, the mass of the catalyst is 0.01 g and the exposure time is 3 h. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 XRD analysis To verify the crystal structure and phase composition of the prepared samples, all samples were characterised by XRD and the results are shown in Fig. 2. The diffraction peaks of Nv-C3N4 at 2θ of 13.1° and 27.6° are attributed to the (100) and (002) crystal planes of (PDF#87-1526) C3N4, corresponding to the intraplanar structural stacking and the interlayer stacking of the conjugated aromatic system, respectively. Pure Cu2S peaks at 2θ of 37.4°, 46.0°, 48.6° and 54.0° are assigned to the (382), (600), (346) and (337) crystal planes of (PDF#9–0328) Cu2S. In addition, the XRD map of Cu2S shows the presence of amorphous material, we surmise this is due to ethylenediamine and copper ions inevitably forming chelates during the reaction process. Cu2S also has a similar amorphous morphology in the relevant literature [29,30]. It is interesting to note that not only the (100) and (002) crystallographic planes of Nv-C3N4, but also the (382), (600), (346) and (337) crystallographic planes of Cu2S appear in 10% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4, indicating the successful preparation of the complexes. Furthermore, apart from the diffraction peaks of Nv-C3N4 and Cu2S, no other impurity peaks were present in 10% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4, indicating the high purity of the prepared complexes. 3.2 SEM and TEM analysis In order to understand the microscopic information on the surface of the prepared catalysts, the samples were characterised by SEM and TEM to obtain Fig. 3. Fig. 3(a) shows the SEM image of Nv-C3N4, which appears as a flaky structure accompanied by severe primitive build-up. Fig. 3(b-c) shows the SEM image of Cu2S, which appears as a regular hexagonal snowflake with a diameter of about 3 µm. Fig. 3(d) shows the SEM image of 10% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4, where it can be seen that Cu2S is firmly attached to the surface of Nv-C3N4. To further observe the degree of bonding between Nv-C3N4 and Cu2S, transmission electron microscopy tests were performed on 10% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 to obtain Fig. 3(e-g). In agreement with the SEM results, there is a tight contact between Cu2S and Nv-C3N4. To further observe the contact morphology, a high resolution transmission electron microscope image of Cu2S at its junction with Nv-C3N4 was obtained, as shown in Fig. 3(h). In the field of view, the majority of amorphous regions (microgrids for transmitting copper lattices) are observed, which are attributed to the amorphous state of Nv-C3N4. At the same time, lattice stripes with a lattice spacing of 0.324 nm are observed, which are attributed to the (104) crystal plane of Cu2S. Fig. 3(i-l) shows the elemental mapping images of 10% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4, and it can be clearly seen that the distribution of Cu and S elements shows a regular snowflake shape, which is consistent with the morphology of Cu2S. And the C and N elements are uniformly distributed around the Cu and S elements, indicating that Cu2S is in close contact with Nv-C3N4. The above results provide sufficient evidence for the successful preparation of Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 heterojunctions. 3.3 Structural properties of the sample composition In order to understand the elemental state and chemical information of the sample surface, XPS tests were carried out on the catalyst to obtain Fig. 4. As shown in Fig. 4(a), not only C and N peaks but also Cu, O and S peaks were present in 10% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4. This confirms the successful preparation of the complexes. Fig. 4(b) shows the C 1 s fitted spectra of Nv-C3N4 and 10% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4. The electron binding energies associated with the characteristic N-CN peaks in Nv-C3N4 and 10% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 are 288.1 and 288.2 eV, respectively. 10% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 shows a shift towards a higher electron binding energy compared to Nv-C3N4. Similar to C 1 s, the electron binding energies of N 1 s fitted to 10% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 were also shifted to a higher angle compared to that of Nv-C3N4 for N 1 s. In addition, the Cu 2p and S profiles of Cu2S and 10% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 were also fitted with split peaks. As shown in Fig. 4(d), Cu 2p in Cu2S can be split into two sets of peaks, Cu 2p3/2 with an electron binding energy of 932.4 eV and Cu 2p1/2 with 952.6 eV. Compared to Cu2S, the electron binding energies of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 in 10% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 are 932.3 eV and 952.4 eV, respectively. In addition, a split-peak fit to the S 2p of Cu2S and 10% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 was performed and the results are shown in Fig. 4(e). It is evident that the S 2p fitted spectra of Cu2S and 10% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 are double peaked, and the electron binding energies for Cu2S S 2p are 161.36 eV for S 2p3/2 and 162.54 eV for S 2p1/2, and for 10% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 S 2p electron binding energies are 161.26 eV for S 2p3/2 and 162.44 eV for S 2p1/2. Similarly, the 10% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 electron binding energy is shifted to a lower angle compared to Cu2S. The above results fully demonstrate the successful preparation of complexes with strong interactions and the flow of electrons from Nv-C3N4 to Cu2S. 3.4 Photoelectric properties and energy band characteristics In order to understand the effect of loading on the optical properties of the catalyst samples, UV–vis tests were carried out on the samples to obtain Fig. 5(a). It is clear that Nv-C3N4 has the lowest degree of optical response. Cu2S has the highest visible light response and the highest light absorption intensity due to the smaller band width and its own black colour. Interestingly, all Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 complexes show a different degree of increase in light absorption intensity compared to pure Nv-C3N4. This facilitates the generation of more electrons and holes, which in turn improves their photocatalytic activity. In addition, the forbidden band widths of Nv-C3N4 and Cu2S were formulated using the Tauc plot equation, which is shown below: （αhν）1/n=A（hν-Eg） In the equation, h is Planck's constant, α is the absorption coefficient, ν is the optical frequency, A is a constant and Eg is the bandgap energy. Indirect bandgap semiconductor n = 2 and direct semiconductor n = 1/2. Since both Nv-C3N4 and Cu2S are indirect semiconductors, n = 2. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the forbidden band widths of Nv-C3N4 and Cu2S are 2.70 and 1.46 eV respectively. Meanwhile, the valence band information of Nv-C3N4 and Cu2S is derived using XPS VB as shown in Fig. 5(c). The valence band potentials of Nv-C3N4 and Cu2S are 2.38 and 1.40 eV, respectively, and the conduction band potentials of Nv-C3N4 and Cu2S are −0.33 and −0.06 eV, respectively, according to the equation ECB = EVB - Eg. The energy band distributions of Nv-C3N4 and Cu2S are shown schematically in Fig. 5(d). To investigate the separation and lifetime of the photogenerated carriers in the catalyst samples, transient photocurrent, AC impedance and photoluminescence tests were performed on Nv-C3N4, 5% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4, 10% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4, 15% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 and 20% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 to obtain Fig. 6. From Fig. 6(a), it can be seen that Nv-C3N4 has the weakest photocurrent density, which means that the electron-hole complexation inside Nv-C3N4 will be fast, which is not conducive to the photocatalytic reaction. The successful preparation of Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 heterojunction solves the problem of fast electron-hole complexation. It is easy to see that the photocurrent of the Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 heterojunction rises and then falls as Cu2S is continuously added. The reason for the rise is that the loading of Cu2S drives the electron-hole directional motion, but as the mass of Cu2S increases, new electron-hole complexation centres are formed covering the surface of Nv-C3N4. In addition, we also investigated the internal resistance to photogenerated electron transfer in the catalysts by performing AC impedance tests on Nv-C3N4, 5% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4, 10% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4, 15% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 and 20% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4, as shown in Fig. 6(b). Since the greater the internal resistance to electron transfer within the catalyst, the slower the electron migration rate, which increases the probability of electron-hole complexation. Therefore, it can be seen from Fig. 6(b) that Nv-C3N4 has the highest internal resistance to electron transfer, which is consistent with the results of the photocurrent test. 10% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 has the lowest internal resistance to electron transfer resistance, which is beneficial for the electron-hole separation efficiency. To further investigate the electron-hole complexation rate, we also performed photoluminescence spectroscopy tests on Nv-C3N4, 5% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4, 10% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4, 15% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 and 20% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 to obtain Fig. 6(c). As shown in Fig. 6(c), Nv-C3N4 has the strongest fluorescence intensity at the excitation wavelength of 330 nm, indicating that Nv-C3N4 has the fastest electron-hole complexation efficiency. Compared to pure Nv-C3N4, the fluorescence intensity of Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 decreases significantly, which means that the electron-hole separation efficiency of Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 is significantly higher. 10% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 has the lowest fluorescence intensity, indicating that it has the lowest electron-hole complexation efficiency. Fig. 6(d) shows the fitted TRPL spectra of Nv-C3N4, Cu2S, 5% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4, 10% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4, 15% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 and 20% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4. The average lifetimes (Ave τ) of Nv-C3N4, Cu2S, 5% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4, 10% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4, 15% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 and 20% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 had average lifetimes (Ave τ) of 4.33, 2.08, 4.01, 3.88, 3.94 and 3.96 ns respectively. Clearly, the fluorescence lifetimes of Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 were all shorter compared to Nv-C3N4, indicating an electron-hole separation efficiency. The shortest fluorescence lifetime of 3.88 ns was found for 10% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4, indicating that 10% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 has the fastest electron-hole separation rate. The characterisation results are consistent with the transient photocurrent, AC impedance and photoluminescence spectra. The above results can effectively show that Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 p-n heterojunction can significantly improve the electron-hole separation efficiency. 3.5 Photocatalytic performance studies The performance of the catalyst was evaluated by its photocatalytic hydrogen production performance. Deionised water was used as the reaction medium, triethanolamine was used as the sacrificial agent to trap photogenerated holes and a 300 W xenon lamp was used as the light source for the hydrogen production performance test. After 3 h of simulated sunlight irradiation, the post-reaction gas was collected and analysed by gas chromatography to obtain the results shown in Fig. 7. The photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency of pure Nv-C3N4 is only 17.3 μmolg−1h−1 due to the fast electron-hole complexation efficiency of Nv-C3N4, while the hydrogen production efficiency of pure Cu2S is only 4.15 μmolg−1h−1. The formation of Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 p-n heterojunction leads to a fast electron-hole orientation separation, resulting in a significant increase in the hydrogen evolution efficiency of Cu2S/Nv-C3N4. The formation of the Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 heterojunction promotes the rapid electron-hole orientation separation, resulting in a significant improvement in the hydrogen generation performance of Cu2S/Nv-C3N4. As shown in Fig. 7(a), the photocatalytic hydrogen production performances of 5% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4, 10% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4, 15% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 and 20% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 were 173, 197, 165 and 153 μmolg−1h−1, respectively. 10% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 had the best photocatalytic hydrogen production, which was 11.4 times that of pure Nv-C3N4 and 47.5 times that of pure Cu2S. This hydrogen production rate was also higher than that of CuO/g-C3N4 composites [31], BiFeO3-g-C3N4-WO3 Z-type heterojunction [32] and MWNTs/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts [33]. The hydrogen production performance of Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 increased and then decreased with increasing Cu2S mass fraction. This is because the loading of a small amount of Cu2S induces a rapid electron-hole separation, which later decreases due to the masking effect. In addition, to investigate the stability of the catalyst, we performed cycling experiments on 10% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4, and the results are shown in Fig. 7(b). 10% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 did not experience any significant degradation of hydrogen production performance after four cycles for 12 h, and only lost about 4%. This indicates that Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 has a high stability. 3.6 Research into photocatalytic mechanisms Based on the above experimental results, we propose a possible mechanism for the Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 photocatalytic decomposition of water hydrogen. As shown in Fig. 8, under visible light irradiation, electrons in the valence bands of Nv-C3N4 and Cu2S are excited and jump to the conduction band, while corresponding holes are generated in the valence band. When the two semiconductors are in close contact, a p-n type heterojunction is formed. Cu2S acts as an electron-rich region and undergoes a reduction reaction to produce H2, while the holes on Cu2S VB are trapped and consumed by TEOA. 4 Conclusion In this study, Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 composite photocatalysts were prepared by in situ deposition using Cu2S and Nv-C3N4 as raw materials, and a series of characterisations of the complexes were carried out. Among all the prepared samples, 10% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 possessed the best photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of 197 μmolg−1h−1, which was 11.4 times higher than pure Nv-C3N4 and 47.5 times higher than Cu2S. The results also show that Cu2S and Nv-C3N4 form a heterogeneous structure at the interface, which achieves rapid photogenerated electron-hole separation and transfer, and exhibits enhanced light absorption capacity. The present work provides a new idea for the preparation of novel C3N4 heterojunction photocatalysts for efficient hydrogen evolution.

        "dc:description": "The high photogenerated electron-hole complexation rate has been the main reason limiting the practical application of carbon nitride, while the construction of heterojunction can promote the separation of photogenerated carriers, broaden the light absorption range and effectively improve its photocatalytic activity. Therefore, in this work, Cu2S was loaded onto g-C3N4 nanosheets by in situ deposition, and a series of Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 p-n heterojunctions were prepared by varying the loading amount of Cu2S. The photocatalytic performance test results showed that the best photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of 10% Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 reached 197 μmolg−1h−1, which was 11.4 times that of pure Nv-C3N4 and 47.5 times that of pure Cu2S. The enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the formation of Cu2S/Nv-C3N4 p-n heterojunction, which effectively promotes the separation and transfer of photogenerated electron-hole and enhances light absorption. This work constructs a novel type of C3N4 heterojunction composite, which provides a new way to improve the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance of C3N4.",
