HAE WON KIM and JONG TAIK KIM Department of Industrial Chemistry, Engineering College, Kyungpook National University, 635 Taegu (Korea) (Received September 30, 1986; accepted March 3, 1987) The dimerization of alkenes is an important method for the production of higher olefins which find extensive application as industrial intermediates. A considerable number of papers [1-14] have dealt with the problem of nickel-containing catalysts for ethylene dimerization. We have synthesized new catalysts which are active for ethylene dimerization even at room temperature. The catalysts were prepared as follows. A coprecipitate of Ni(OH)2 Zr(OH)4 was obtained by adding aqueous ammonia slowly to a mixed aqueous solution of nickel chloride and zirconium oxychloride at room temperature with stirring until the pH of mother liquor reached ~8. The precipitate thus obtained was washed thoroughly with distilled water until chloride ion was not detected, and was dried at room temperature. The dried precipitate was powdered below 100 mesh, and then modification with anions was performed by pouring 30 ml of each of 1 N HaSC^, HaP04, and H3BO>3, respectively, onto 2 g of the powdered sample on a filter paper, followed by drying in air. The resultant solids were used as catalysts after decomposing at different evacuation temperatures for 1.5 h. The catalysts modified with HzS04, H3P04 and 113803 are referred to as NiO ZrO;/ S04-2, NiO Zr02/P04-3, and NiO ZrOz/BO^\"3, respectively. The catalytic activity for ethylene dimerization was determined at 20 C by a conventional static system following the pressure change from an initial pressure of 280 torr. Fresh catalyst sample of 0.2 g was used for every run and the catalytic activity was calculated as the amount of ethylene consumed in the initial 5 min. Reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography with a VZ-7 column at room temperature. The catalytic activities for the dimerization of ethylene were examined and the results are shown as a function of evacuation temperature in Fig. 1, where the NiO mol percent of catalyst is 25. It can be seen that the activity appears above 200 C, reaching a maximum at 400 C. Although the samples which were not modified with anions were inactive as catalysts for ethylene *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/87/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 376 200 300 400 500 600 Evacuation temperature, C Fig. 1.

In particular, NiO ZrOi/SC^\"2 showed the most effective catalysis. On all the NiO ZrO; catalysts modified with anions, the products obtained from the gas phase were exclusively n-butenes, in analogy with nickel-containing catalysts [2-6, 10-13]. However, a small amount of hexenes from the phase absorbed on the catalyst surface was detected. In a previous paper it was demonstrated that the catalytic activities of NiO SiOz substantially parallel the acidities [10]. Nevertheless, it did not show how the activity of the solid acid catalyst depends upon the acid strength. The acid strengths of the present samples modified with anions were examined by a color change method using Hammett indicators, when powdered sample was added to an indicator dissolved in dried benzene. Since it was very difficult to observe the color of indicators adsorbed on catalysts of high nickel oxide content, a low percentage of nickel oxide (5 mol%) was used in this experiment. The results are listed in Table 1, where + indicates that the color of the base form changed to that of the conjugate acid form. The acid strength of the sample without anions was found to be HQ ^ 3.0. However, the acid strengths of NiO Zr02/S04\"2, NiO Zr02/P04~3, and NiO ZrOa/BOs\"3 were estimated to be ffo^ 14.5, Hy^ 8.2, and Ho ^ 5.6, respectively. It is of considerable interest that the catalytic activities correlate with the acid strengths of the catalysts. A clear dependence of catalytic activity upon acid strength is shown in Table 1. An acid stronger than Ho = 11.93, which corresponds to an acid strength of 100% ^804, is known as a super- acid [15]. Consequently, NiO ZrOa/SC^\"2 would be a solid superacid. Superacid properties are attributed to the double bond nature of S=0 of the complexes by the interaction of NiO ZrOz with sulfate ion [16,17]. NiO ZrO; alone without anions, whose acid strength was found to be Ho ^= 3.0, was totally inactive for the dimerization reaction at room temperature. These results indicate that ethylene dimerization requires acid sites stronger than Ho = 3.0.

Nickel oxide modified with H^SC^ exhibited a low activity for the dimerization, but nickel oxide without sulfate ion was totally inactive. Therefore the active site responsible for dimerization is suggested to consist of a low-valent nickel and an acid, as observed in the NiO-containing catalysts [4, 5]. The term 'low-valent nickel' originated from the fact that the NiO SiC>2 catalyst was drastically poisoned by carbon monoxide, since a low-valent nickel is prone to chemisorb carbon monoxide [4]. In this work, all catalysts modified with acids were poisoned by 1 p.mol g~1 of carbon monoxide for dimerization. It seems that the formation of low- valent nickel is caused by evacuation at high temperatures followed by oxygen vacancy. References 1 J. P. Hogan, R. L. Banks, W. C. Lanning and A. dark, Ind. Eng.
