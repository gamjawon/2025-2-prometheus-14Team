College of Chemical Engineering Beijing Institute of Petrochemical Technology 19 Qing-Yuan North Road Beijing 102617 China Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) is studied over Metal-organic framework (MOF) based porous carbon supported iron catalysts promoted with Na, Cu and Ru metals. The FTS results showed that all promoters can enhance CO conversion, FT product yield (FTY), and CO2 selectivity is also increased. Among all promoters, Cu-based sample exhibits the best promoting effect in activity (FTY=0.154 molCO g Fe −1 h − 1). Interestingly, the activity is about 2 times higher to that of unpromoted catalysts. Ru-contained sample exhibits the most significant influence on the light hydrocarbon production, with the C1–4 hydrocarbon selectivity above 70%. Na-contained sample performed the highest C5+ selectivity of 66% with a medium CO conversion of 51%. The improved FTS activity and selectivity of promoted catalysts is related to the decrease in iron particle size as confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It is confirmed, the small iron particles of the promoted catalyst are stabilized on the surface of carbon matrix, preventing further aggregation at high temperature, which is contributed to the improved FTS performance. Our research study showed that Na, Cu and Ru can not only affect the distribution of resulting products but also improve the activity of FTS. In short, the effect of Cu is remarkable on the MOF-derived catalyst. Similarly, the MOF-derived porous carbon catalysts confined the iron species during the reaction process, provide a clear structure-activity relationship between the promoters and the catalytic performance. Finally, this novel work can provide a new pathway for metal-organic framework-derived Fe-embedded porous carbon catalysts for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Graphical abstract Image, graphical abstract Keywords Metal-organic framework Promoter effect Porous carbon supported catalyst Iron catalyst Fischer-Tropsch synthesis 1 Introduction Conversion of synthesis gas (syngas, a mixture of H2 and CO) derived from coal, biomass, and natural gas via Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) is an alternative way to produce liquid fuels and valuable chemicals. [1-5] FTS is an important approach and has been received considerable attention for energy production and environmental remediation. FTS can be catalyzed by iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni) and ruthenium (Ru) metals. Among them, Fe is the most cost-effective and accurate choice. The Fe-based catalysts at high temperature can produce unsaturated short-chain hydrocarbons or oxygenates, which are the most important high-value chemicals. Accordingly, Fe-based FTS catalysts is the most accurate choice as industrial catalyst in high temperature FTS. [1, 3, 6-9] Additionally, the addition of alkali and other metallic promoters in Fe-based FTS catalysts is a pretty good choice to improve catalytic activity, selectivity and stability [10-12]. Up to date many efforts are carried out to further improve the catalytic performance of Fe-based catalysts, and cop up the major challenge is reducing the deactivation rate caused by sintering, carbon deposition or Fe phase changes. It is widely known, SiO2, ZnO, TiO2 and γ-Al2O3 are often used as porous supports or structural promoters to increase the dispersion of Fe. However, these supports tend to form mixed oxides such as Fe silicates, titanates due to strong metal-support interaction that are hardly reducible and therefore non-active for FTS. [13, 14] Carbon materials, such as, activated carbon, carbon nano-tubes, carbon nanofibers, and carbon spheres have been used as FTS catalysts supports. [15-17] These materials show chemical inertness, high specific surface area, tunable morphology and surface chemistry which are beneficial to catalytic reaction. However, carbon-supported Fe catalysts are generally prepared in a complex process including pyrolysis of organic precursors, physical or chemical activation of the carbon supports, deposition of the active metals by ion-exchange, incipient wetness impregnation or other methods, and then followed by thermal calcination and reduction. These synthetic approaches are often non-continuous and harmful for the distribution of the active phase. [18] Metal-organic framework (MOF) is a class of porous, robust and crystalline hybrid materials constructed from metals and organic ligands, MOF have been widely used in gas storage or separation, catalysis, bioimaging, chemical sensing, drug delivery, and luminescence applications due to their unique structure and textural properties. [19-22] Recently, it has been proved that MOF-derived carbon-supported metal materials via a pyrolysis process is a promising alternative in the catalyst deactivation problems in FTS. [23-27] For example, Fe-based catalysts derived from Fe-BTC (BTC-1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate) features high dispersion of Fe nanoparticles embedded in porous carbon matrix. [28-30] Likewise, K-promoted MOF-derived catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic performance with superior selectivity, activity and stability. [28] To best of our knowledge, a very limited work are reported about MOF-derived FTS catalyst with different kind of promoters, therefore investigating and improving MOF-derived Fe-based catalyst with various promoters are highly desirable. Herein, we reported the impact of alkalis, transition metal, and noble metals on the structure and catalytic performance of MOF-derived Fe-based FTS catalysts (Fe@C). More importantly herein, we choose MIL-100 as precursor while Na, Cu, Ru as promoters, and further investigated to elucidate the influence of three different types of promoters on crystalline structure, texture properties, morphology, reduction properties and catalytic performance of the promoted catalysts by a series of characterization methods. Interestingly, the promoted catalysts exhibit higher FTS activity compared with the unpromoted catalyst. The obtained structure-activity relations in this work will contribute to the rational design of high-performance Fischer-Tropsch catalysts derived from MOF. Finally, this novel work can provide a new pathway for metal-organic framework-derived Fe-embedded porous carbon catalysts for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The iron-containing precursor MIL-100(Fe) was synthesized by hydrothermal synthesis technique by following already reported method. [31] In typical experiment, 1.12 g iron powder and 2.774 g H3BTC (1,3,5-Benzenetricarboxylic acid) were dissolved in 108 mL deionized water, the mixture was sonicated for 60 min. Subsequently, 1.375 mL HF (50 wt%) and 1.66 mL HNO3(60 wt%) were added to the as received mixture which was continuously sonicated for 30 min. Then the mixture was sealed in 200 mL Teflon-lined steel autoclave and heated up to 150 °C for 12 h. After naturally cooling the product was collected by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 3 min. The as-prepared MIL-100 was activated by reflux in hot water at 80 °C for 5 h, the residual components was removed by using ethanol at 60 °C for 3 h. Subsequently, the activated MIL-100 was dried in a vacuum oven at 100 °C for 12 h. The Fe@C catalysts were obtained by pyrolysis of MIL-100 precursor in a tubular oven at 500 °C for 8 h with a heating rate of 2 °C/min under N2 atmosphere (100 mL/min). Before exposed to air, the catalysts were passivated with 10%(v/v) O2/N2 for 1 h at room temperature. The promoted catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) method with a final promoter content 1wt% in the catalyst. A certain amount of Na2CO3, Cu(NO3)2•3H2O, RuCl3 was dissolved in a mixture of deionized water and methanol (v/v = 50/50) respectively, the solution was then added dropwise to the Fe@C catalyst under ultrasonic assisted. The resultant materials were dried under vacuum at 100 °C for 6 h followed by calcination at 500 °C for 2 h. The as received catalysts denoted as X/Fe@C, where X represents the additives (X=Na/Cu/Ru). Notably, The Fe@C catalyst without promoter was used as blank sample. 2.2 Catalyst characterization X-ray Diffraction (XRD) Measurements. X-ray diffraction patterns were collected by a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer with a Cu Kα (λ= 0.154 nm) radiation at 45 kV and 40 mA. The spectra were scanned with scanning rate of 10°/min in the 2θ range of 3–90° Nitrogen Adsorption Measurements. Nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms were recorded on a Quantachrome Autosorb-iQ3 instrument at −196 °C. Samples were previously degassed at 200 °C for 12 h. The BET method was used to calculate the surface area. The pore volumes and average pore size were determined by Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. H2 Temperature-programmed Reduction Measurements (H2-TPR). The H2-TPR tests were carried out in the Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 instrument. The catalyst samples were pretreated in an argon flow at 300 °C for 1 h, followed by cooling down to 50 °C and hold for 30 min. A gas mixture of 5% H2/Ar was passed over the samples at a flow rate of 30 mL/min. The sample was heated by increasing temperature of the samples to 800 °C linearly at a rate of 10 °C/min. The hydrogen consumption was continuously monitored by a thermal conductivity detector. CO Temperature-programmed Desorption Measurements (CO-TPD). The CO-TPD tests were conducted on the Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 instrument. 100 mg sample was reduced by H2 (30 ml/min) at 300 °C for 2 h, then cooled down to 50 °C under Ar flow (50 mL/min). Following, 5% CO/He (30 ml/min) was introduced and held for 1 h, after CO adsorption saturation was achieved, sample tubes are flushed with Ar, the gas flow was set to 50 mL/min. When a stable baseline was achieved, the CO-TPD was recorded from 50 °C to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) Measurements. The X-ray photoelectron analysis was performed with a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha that equipped with a monochromatized Al Kα source (1486.6 eV). The spectra were collected at room temperature in high vacuum operated at 12 kV and 6 mA. The combined energy of 284.8 eV for C1s was used for the binding energy calibration. Inductively Coupled Plasma Measurements (ICP). The metal contents of the prepared catalysts were determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy. The analysis was carried out on an Agilent 720ES after completely digestion of the solid samples. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) measurements. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) measurements of the samples were performed with JEOL JEM-2100 F and FEI tecnai G2F20 S-Twin respectively. Furthermore, an X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer was also utilized in conjunction with TEM imaging to acquire TEM-EDS spectrum-imaging data. 2.3 Catalytic performance test The FTS reaction performance test were performed in a fixed-bed reactor. In typical experiment, 0.6 g catalyst was diluted with SiC (100 mesh) and loaded into a stainless-steel tube. Catalyst was reduced in situ in pure H2 at 270 °C and a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 5 L•gcat −1•h − 1 for 12 h in ambient pressure. After reduction, the reaction temperature was decreased to 100 °C, the syngas (H2/CO=1) was introduced with mass flow controllers. After the system pressure reached to 2.5 MPa, the reaction temperature was raised to 340 °C. The FTS reaction was maintained at 2.5 MPa, 340 °C and 5 L•gcat −1•h−1. CO, H2 and other tail gas were analyzed online by Agilent 490 Micro GC equipped with four columns and thermal conductivity (TCD) detectors. Catalytic activity is defined as moles of CO converted to hydrocarbons exclude CO2 per gram of iron per hour (FTY, molCO•gFe −1•h − 1). The selectivity of different hydrocarbons was determined based on carbon numbers. The rate of water gas shift WGS (RWGS) were defined as the rate of carbon dioxide formation. C5+ selectivity was calculated from the CO conversion by subtracting the formation of C1 C4 products (CO2 unincluded) from the total amount of CO converted. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst characterization The precursor for MIL-100(Fe) was characterized by XRD, as shown in Fig. 1 . The XRD pattern of MIL-100(Fe) was confirmed from simulated file, the diffraction peaks observed were fit well with the simulated peaks, indicating the successful synthesis and highly purified crystalline nature of MIL-100(Fe). [31] Subsequently, the MIL-100(Fe) was pyrolyzed in a temperature-programmed furnace at 500 °C for 8 h under N2 atmosphere to convert MOF into Fe@C catalyst. Na, Cu and Ru were used to modify the Fe@C catalyst with a fixed content. The morphological properties of the precursor and the promoted catalysts were characterized with TEM and the results are shown in Fig. 2 . It can be observed that the MIL-100 exhibits a regular polyhedral configuration (Figure S1). After pyrolysis, the promoters generate no effect on catalyst morphology, as shown in Fig. 2a-2d. Moreover, a large number of spherical particles are uniformly dispersed on the surface of catalysts. The corresponding particle size distribution histograms (inner patterns in Fig. 2a-2d) show a decrease in average particle size from 18.7 nm in unpromoted Fe@C to 14.5 nm in Ru/Fe@C,14.2 nm in Na/Fe@C and 13.7 nm in Cu/Fe@C, indicating a higher dispersion of iron nanoparticles. Based on the HRTEM image of Fig. 2e-2f, the particles have lattice fringes with spacings of 0.253 nm and 0.297 nm, which correspond to (311) and (220) planes of Fe3O4, respectively, suggesting the main phase of the particles is Fe3O4, which are in good agreement with the XRD results. The EDS elemental mapping image of Cu/Fe@C reveal that Fe and Cu particles were uniformly distributed over the catalyst, as shown in Fig. 2i. XRD analysis was performed to identify the crystal structure and phase of the promoted and unpromoted catalysts (Fig. 1). All catalysts show diffraction peaks at 2θ=30.1°, 35.4°, 43.0°, 53.4°, 56.9° and 62.5°, which can be attributed to the characteristic diffraction peaks of Fe3O4 (JCPDS No.19–0629). The Ru/Fe@C catalysts also shows characteristic diffraction peaks of metallic Fe (JCPDS No.06–0696) at 2θ=44.7°, 65.0° and 82.3° With the addition of Na, Cu and Ru, the intensity of the diffraction peaks is hindered and the peak width becomes broader, the results indicate that the Fe@C catalysts with promoters show small particle size and low crystallinity. The particle sizes can be calculated by Debye-Scherrer equation and the data are listed in Table 1 . The crystal size of the four catalysts is estimated from the peak width of Fe3O4 (220, 311, 400, 511 and 440 planes), the values are 14.2 nm (Na/Fe@C),13.7 nm (Cu/Fe@C) and 18.0 nm (Ru/Fe@C), respectively. The values are in good agreement with the average particle size measured from TEM images. Decrease in crystal size after the addition of promoters confirms that promoters can reduce the aggregation of iron species. Due to the low content of promoters, there are no characteristic peaks attributed to Na, Cu and Ru species in XRD curves. ICP-OES were used to determine the elemental composition of the promoted catalysts. As shown in table 1, the promoter loadings of the catalysts are obtained at 1.4 wt% (Na), 1.3 wt% (Cu) and 0.7 wt% (Ru). The results confirmed that Na, Cu and Ru loadings are about the same as that desired theoretical content of 1.0 wt%. The porosity of promoted catalysts was measured by N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at −196 °C. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the calcinated Fe@C exhibited type IV isotherm with a hysteresis loop at p/p 0=0.8 −0.95, indicating the presence of abundant mesopore structure. There is no clear change in isotherm between the Fe@C catalysts with Na, Cu and Ru promoters. The total pore volume of Na/Fe@C, Cu/Fe@C and Ru/Fe@C catalysts are 0.41, 0.43 and 0.45 cm3g−1, respectively. The high pore volume can ensure efficient diffusion of feed gas and products, which is beneficial to FTS activity. The texture properties include BET surface area, pore size distribution and total pore volume of the catalysts are shown in Table 1. The pore size distribution and the average pore size of the promoted catalysts also remain in the same range (Table 1 and Fig. 3b). It can be clearly observed that the pore size change is minor with the addition of Na, Cu and Ru, indicating the addition of promoters will not block the pores. The surface area showed no change with the promoters except for Ru. Ru increased the surface area of Fe@C catalyst by ~10%. The XPS results given in Fig. 4 a displays the survey scan XPS spectra of the catalysts, it can be seen that C, O and Fe are the major elements in the surface. All catalysts also show a weak F 1 s peak, possibly originated from the HF reactant in the synthesis process of MIL-100(Fe). Because the promoter species are negligible for the phase composition to be ascertained by TEM or XRD analysis, the high resolution XPS spectra of Na 1 s, Cu 2p and Ru 3p are investigated to confirm the chemical states of the promoters (Figure S2). The promoters are identified by the binding energies of Na 1 s (1071.7 eV), Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 (933.8 eV and 953.8 eV) [32] and Ru 3p3/2 (462.5 eV) [33]. The XPS results confirmed the existence of Na2O, CuO and RuO2 phases on Na/Fe@C, Cu/Fe@C and Ru/Fe@C catalysts, respectively. Fig. 4b shows the high-resolution spectrum of Fe 2p of Fe@C. The two peaks at ~710 and ~712 eV, coupling with satellite peaks at ~715 and~ 719 eV can be assigned to Fe2+ and Fe3+2p3/2, suggesting the coexistence of an Fe2O3 phase and FeO phase at the surface. [34-36] This result is consistent with TEM and XRD results. As shown in Fig. 4b, the addition of promoters did not further cause shift in the binding energy in Fe 2p spectrum. However, the proportion of Fe2+ on the surface is increased after impregnation and calcination, indicating a lower binding strength between iron and carbon. Thus, it can be concluded that Na, Cu and Ru change the chemical environment of iron site. This would be expected to facilitate the reduction of Fe species. [37] H2-TPR was adopted to investigate the effect of promoters on the reduction behavior of the Fe@C catalysts as presented in Fig. 5 a. All the H2-TPR profiles show a small reduction peak at 300–400 °C and one unresolved reduction peak at 500–700 °C. The first peak at low temperature is attributed to the reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, along with the reduction of CuO to Cu or RuO2 to Ru. The reduction peak at 500–700 °C can be attributed to the reduction of Fe3O4 to FeO or metallic Fe. [38-40] With the addition of Cu, the first reduction peak shift towards lower temperature, indicating the Cu improved the reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, this is attributed to the nucleation of Cu provides H2 dissociation sites. Ru has similar H2 spillover effect that can facilitate iron reduction. However, the addition of Na does not reduce the reduction temperature compared with the unpromoted catalyst, on the contrary, the reduction peak shift to a higher temperature. This can be explained in terms of the interaction between the Na and the iron species, the electron transfer from Na to the Fe3O4 result in an increase of the electron density of the Fe sites and suppress H2 adsorption on the catalyst surface. [41] Based on these results, it can be concluded that Cu and Ru enhanced the reducibility of the catalysts, while Na inhibit the reduction. [35, 42, 43] CO-TPD was used to investigate the effect of Na, Cu and Ru promoters on the CO adsorption. The CO-TPD results of the catalysts are exhibited in Fig. 5b. All the catalysts have two CO desorption peak: one is appeared at below 300 °C corresponding to the CO molecular adsorption, while the other in the range of 500–650 °C, which could be attributed to the CO dissociative adsorption. [44, 45] A clearly shift of the first desorption peak is observed in the Na, Cu and Ru-promoted catalysts, this can be attributed to the decrease of iron particle size, which would enlarge the adsorption amount of CO and further improve the CO adsorption. In this study, the CO desorption peak mainly located at ~570 °C, which is attributed to the process of dissociative CO adsorbed and recombined to desorb. The desorption temperatures of Fe@C catalysts are higher than those of dissociative CO desorption over iron single-crystal planes (~500 °C). [44, 46] It is reasonable that, during the CO-TPD process, the Fe3O4 is going to be reduced and carbonized, the desorbed CO species include not only the surface adsorbed C and O, but also those in the crystal lattices of iron carbides and oxides. From this point of view, proper regulation of the Fe-C and Fe-O bonds can improve the CO adsorption. It is noteworthy that the CO desorption peak of Na/Fe@C shifted to a higher temperature than that of Fe@C, it is evidences that Na is beneficial to enhance the CO adsorption. Na, as an electron donor, could transfer electron to adjacent Fe species, enhance the Fe–C bond and generate more iron carbides. The CO desorption peaks of Cu/Fe@C and Ru/Fe@C catalysts are broader than that of Fe@C, indicating the active sites for CO adsorption were enriched by adding promoters. Cu and Ru can not only promote the nucleation of reduced Fe species, but also lead to a large number of CO binding sites, which improved the steady-state FTS activity. [10] 3.2 Catalytic performance on FTS All FTS reaction performance tests over the Fe@C catalysts (promoted and unpromoted) were conducted under the same conditions: 340 °C, 2.5 MPa, H2/CO=1 and a space velocity of 5 L•gcat-1h-1. Figs. 6 a, and b show the CO conversion (XCO) and Fe time yield (FTY) of all catalysts as a function of time-on-stream (TOS). According to the XRD and CO-TPD results, promoters facilitate the formation of smaller particle size and more exposed active sites, so the FTY values of promoted catalysts are increased. Previous work has shown that K promoter could improve the FTS activity and product selectivity of MOF-derived Fe@C catalyst. [28] The Na, Cu and Ru promoted catalysts in this study exhibit significant increase in CO conversion. The improved activity is possibly due to the electron promoter effect of Na or spillover effect of H2 and/or CO molecules thus lead to the increase of active phase. However, some difference of the CO conversion for the catalysts with different promoters are observed. Fe@C with no promoters display the lowest CO conversion, the steady state CO conversion and FTY increased in the sequence of Fe@C < Na/Fe@C < Ru/Fe@C < Cu/Fe@C. The CO conversion of Na/Fe@C displayed slight and continuous increase, indicating an induction period exists prior to steady state conversion level. [47] Although the addition of Ru promoter leads to high initial catalytic activity, the CO conversion decreased from 70% to 60% after 30 h. The deactivation can be attributed to the oxidation or sintering of Ru at high reaction temperature. [48] Remarkably, the Cu/Fe@C shows the highest CO conversion. The improved catalytic activity may be attributed to the enhancement of dissociative adsorption of the CO molecule on the surface of catalysts, which is conducive to the formation of active iron carbide phase. [49] The addition of both Cu and Ru also improved the WGS reaction activity, as shown in Table 2 . Interestingly, the RWGS of Cu and Ru-promoted catalysts are about 3–5 times higher than that of the unpromoted catalyst. Previous research work confirmed that adding Cu and Ru to Fe3O4 can improve WGS activity, especially at high temperature. [50, 51] Furthermore, the WGS reaction is an endothermic process, the temperature used in this study will accelerate the reaction rate. Fe3O4 is considered as the active phase for WGS, but there is no difference in the amount of Fe3O4 of the as prepared catalysts, Cu and Ru show significant impact on the WGS activity. The product selectivity is shown in Table 2 and Figs. 6c, the Cu and Ru promoters lead to higher CO2 selectivity, this is relevant to the high WGS activity. The selectivity to CH4 also increased for the Cu and Ru promoted catalysts, this can be due to the particle size effect, the average particle size isdecreased with the addition of Cu and Ru, the H coverages increase with decreasing particle size, thus, catalyst with smaller particle size display higher CH4 selectivity. [3, 52] The Na/Fe@C shows lower CH4 selectivity, this is likely caused by the enhanced surface basicity with the addition of Na, leading to the decrease of H2 concentration on the surface of Fe. The absence of adsorbed H species hinders the secondary hydrogenation reaction result in high olefin selectivity. [53, 54] The olefin/paraffin ratio of Na/Fe@C is increased compared to the unpromoted catalyst, for Cu/Fe@C and Ru/Fe@C, the olefin/paraffin ratios are decreased to 0.1 and 0.25, respectively. The C5+ selectivity is contrary to CH4 selectivity, the Na/Fe@C displays the highest C5+ selectivity and the lowest CH4 selectivity, while the Cu/Fe@C and Ru/Fe@C show opposite trend. The possible reason is that Cu and Ru promoters leading to enrichment of H species on the surface of catalyst and improve the hydrogenation. The effect of promoters of Na, Cu, and Ru in this work is in line with abovementioned literature work. However, the catalytic activity is less active than other MOF-derived FT catalyst, this may be related to the larger particle size. De Jong [55] and Jorge Gascon et al. [47] have reported that FTY show an inversely trend to particle size. XRD patterns of the spent catalysts with Cu promoter is shown in Figure S3. SiC served as diluter in fixed bed reactor can be found in catalysts, spent Cu/Fe@C catalyst also shows obvious Fe3O4 peaks. Besides, TEM image of spent catalyst shows that the particle size of the iron is only slightly enlarged from 11 to 12 nm after 100 h on stream (Figure S4), indicating the high stability of Cu/Fe@C in the reaction process. The excellent stability indicates that iron carbide nanoparticles confined in the carbon matrix can prevent aggregation and sintering during the FTS reaction [56]. 4 Conclusions MOF-derived Fe@C was used to investigate the influence of different promoters (Na, Cu, Ru) on the physicochemical property and performance of FTS catalysts. It was found that the Na, Cu and Ru promoters showed significant effect on the reduction and carbonization behaviours. The addition of promoters could decrease the iron particle size, improve CO chemisorption and suppress H2 adsorption. In FTS reaction, the presence of Na, Cu and Ru significantly increase the CO conversion. The Na promoter is effective to decrease CH4 selectivity, improve the selectivity to olefins and shift the products to heavy hydrocarbons. Ru promoter shows more significant influence on the formation of methane and light hydrocarbons. Cu/Fe@C catalyst shows the highest CO conversion, FTY, as well as highest CO2 selectivity caused by the enhanced WGS reaction. Iron nanoparticles are embedded in the carbon matrix derived from MOF, aggregation and sintering are inapparent, so the catalysts showed excellent stability with high steady state activity after 100 h on stream. This work gives insights into the development of novel promoted MOF-derived FTS catalysts.

        "dc:description": "Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) is studied over Metal-organic framework (MOF) based porous carbon supported iron catalysts promoted with Na, Cu and Ru metals. The FTS results showed that all promoters can enhance CO conversion, FT product yield (FTY), and CO2 selectivity is also increased. Among all promoters, Cu-based sample exhibits the best promoting effect in activity (FTY=0.154 molCO g Fe −1 h − 1). Interestingly, the activity is about 2 times higher to that of unpromoted catalysts. Ru-contained sample exhibits the most significant influence on the light hydrocarbon production, with the C1–4 hydrocarbon selectivity above 70%. Na-contained sample performed the highest C5+ selectivity of 66% with a medium CO conversion of 51%. The improved FTS activity and selectivity of promoted catalysts is related to the decrease in iron particle size as confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It is confirmed, the small iron particles of the promoted catalyst are stabilized on the surface of carbon matrix, preventing further aggregation at high temperature, which is contributed to the improved FTS performance. Our research study showed that Na, Cu and Ru can not only affect the distribution of resulting products but also improve the activity of FTS. In short, the effect of Cu is remarkable on the MOF-derived catalyst. Similarly, the MOF-derived porous carbon catalysts confined the iron species during the reaction process, provide a clear structure-activity relationship between the promoters and the catalytic performance. Finally, this novel work can provide a new pathway for metal-organic framework-derived Fe-embedded porous carbon catalysts for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis.",
