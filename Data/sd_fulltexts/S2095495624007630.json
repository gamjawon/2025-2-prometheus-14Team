Graphical abstract “Tennis racket” hydrogel electrolytes can uniform Zn2+ flux and reduce active H2O to hinder dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at anode side, as well as repulse I3 − ions to suppress shuttle effect at cathode side. Aqueous zinc-iodine (Zn-I2) batteries show great potential as energy storage candidates due to their high-safety and low-cost, but confronts hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendrite growth at anode side and polyiodide shuttling at cathode side. Herein, “tennis racket” (TR) hydrogel electrolytes were prepared by the co-polymerization and co-blending of polyacrylamide (PAM), sodium lignosulfonate (SL), and sodium alginate (SA) to synchronously regulate cathode and anode of Zn-I2 batteries. “Gridline structure” of TR can induce the uniform transportation of Zn2+ ions through the coordination effect to hinder HER and dendrite growth at anode side, as well as hit I3 − ions as “tennis” via the strong repulsion force to avoid shuttle effect at cathode side. The synergistic effect of TR electrolyte endows Zn-Zn symmetric battery with high cycling stability over 4500 h and Zn-I2 cell with the stably cycling life of 15000 cycles at 5 A g−1, outperforming the reported works. The practicability of TR electrolyte is verified by flexible Zn-I2 pouch battery. This work opens a route to synchronously regulate cathode and anode to enhance the electrochemical performance of Zn-I2 batteries. Keywords Tennis racket Hydrogel electrolyte Interface regulation Zinc anode Zinc-iodide batteries 1 Introduction Lithium ion batteries have emerged as a mainstream choice in energy storage field owing to their high energy density and excellent cycle stability [1,2]. Nevertheless, high-cost lithium resources and flammable and toxic organic electrolytes of lithium-ion batteries compel urgently researchers to search for alternative energy storage system [3–5]. Among the reported works, aqueous zinc-iodine (Zn-I2) batteries stand out due to their high theoretical specific capacity of Zn anodes (5855 mA h cm−3, 820 mA h g−1) and I2 cathodes (1040 mA h cm−3, 211 mA h g−1) [6] and suitable discharge potential platform (1.2 V vs. Zn/Zn2+) [7]. However, uneven deposition and thermodynamic instability of Zn anode respectively generate the dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), as well as the spontaneous formation of I3 − ions at cathode side can shuttle through the electrolyte and cross the membrane to corrode Zn anode, which deteriorate the electrochemical properties of Zn-I2 batteries. Many pioneering works mainly focus on the interface regulation of Zn anode through electrolyte engineering and surface modification. The uniformity of Zn2+ flow is achieved to induce the homogeneous deposition behavior for the hinderance of dendrite growth. The physical barrier effect towards H2O molecules and the destroying process of Zn(H2O)6 2+ solvation structure can effectively reduce the contact of active H2O with Zn anode to avoid the occurrence of HER and the formation of insulative by-products. At present, surface coating layers (chitosan [8], nanodiamond [9], and Nafion/Zn3(PO4)2 composite [10]) and electrolyte additives (glycine [11], sodium gluconate [12], and propylene glycol [13]) have been developed to enhance the electrochemical performance of Zn metal anodes. Moreover, for the shuttle effect of I3 − ions at cathode side, adsorption immobilization, heteroatomic anchoring, and single-atom catalysts have been used to solve the shuttle effect of I3 − ions through the hierarchical porous carbon nanofiber membranes or N, O co-doped graphene film to adsorb I3 − [14], the nanoclusters anchored on the carbon to suppress the formation of polyiodide [15], and the catalysis of iron and its derivatives to regulate charge transfer of iodine [16]. Nevertheless, the above methods mainly focus on anode or cathode sections to solve the overall performance improvement. Therefore, synchronized regulation of anode and cathode sides is highly desirable to realize the hinderance of dendrite growth, HER, and I3 − shuttle. Herein, “tennis racket” (TR) hydrogel electrolyte was prepared by grafting sodium lignosulfonate (SL) with acrylamide (AM) and blending with sodium alginate (SA) to synchronously regulate cathode and anode of Zn-I2 batteries. “Gridline structure” of TR consists of the covalently crosslinked network of polyacrylamide (PAM) with a rigid benzene ring structure of SL and the ionic crosslinking mode of SA provides a flexible network for TR, which can serve as ion transportation channels to uniform deposition behavior of Zn2+ ions and decrease active H2O to hinder HER at anode side. Abundant heteroatom groups and anion-rich structure in TR electrolyte can hit I3 − ions as “tennis” to successfully suppress the I3 − shuttle effect at cathode side. The synchronous regulation of TR electrolyte on cathode and anode gives Zn anodes excellent cycling life of over 4500 h at 0.5 mA cm−2 and endows Zn-I2 batteries with long-term cycling stability of 15000 cycles at 5 A g−1. 2 Results and discussion In conventional liquid electrolyte (LE), the uneven deposition behavior of Zn2+ ions induces dendrite growth to cause the short circuits by piercing the diaphragm (Fig. 1 a) at anode side. Thermodynamic instability of Zn anode with H2O causes the occurrence of HER and the formation of insulative by-products (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, the spontaneous generation of I3 − ions from the reaction (I2 + I− ↔ I3 −) [17] can shuttle from cathode to corrode Zn anode (Zn + I3 − ↔ Zn2+ + 3I−) [18] (Fig. 1b). Electron transfer via internal circuits results in severe self-discharge, which significantly reduces the specific capacity and the Coulombic efficiency (CE) [19,20]. In this work, “tennis racket” (TR) hydrogel electrolytes were prepared to uniform Zn2+ ions flux and reduce H2O activity for the hinderance of dendrite growth and HER. Meanwhile, abundant anionic groups in TR can form the electronegative sites to electrostatically repulse I3 − ions for the hinderance of the shuttle effect and self-discharge phenomenon (Fig. 1c). TR electrolyte was synthesized by grafting and blending methods with polyacrylamide (PAM) and sodium lignosulfonate (SL) as rigid fragments, sodium alginate (SA) as a flexible fragment, and the heteroatom functional groups as anion-rich sites (Fig. 1d). SA serves as an ionic cross-linking framework to facilitate energy transfer and dissipation under stress [21,22], resulting in a flexible structure of TR electrolyte. Moreover, PAM acts as a covalent cross-linking framework and requires high energy to break covalent bonds during strain [23,24], which leads to a rigid structure of TR electrolyte. Particularly, the multi rigid benzene ring structure and abundant polar groups of SL sustain the hydrogel framework, thus improving the mechanical properties of TR electrolyte [25–27]. Firstly, potassium persulfate (KPS) generates free radicals to attack the C=C bonds from AM and N,N′-methylenebis(acrylamide) (MBA) under thermal initiation, resulting in the elongation of AM chains and the formation of covalent cross-links. Concurrently, the phenolic hydroxyl groups of SL are grafted onto these cross-linking sites [28] and establish the initial covalent hydrogel network. Subsequently, the prepared hydrogel was immersed in aqueous electrolyte salt (2 M ZnSO4), and the Zn2+ ions combined with the carboxyl groups in SA acted as ionic cross-linkers to form a second flexible network. The above networked hydrogels interlace with each other to form the “tennis racket” effect of TR hydrogel electrolyte (Fig. S1). For comparation, hydrogel electrolyte without SL (PS) is prepared in the same method without SL component to explore the influence of benzene ring structure and the sulfonic acid group. The chemical structure and mechanical property of TR electrolyte were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR), tensile test, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping. The characteristic peak of sulphonate group at 1045 cm−1 and the improved peak intensity of aromatic ether at 1130 cm−1 (Fig. 2 a) confirm the successful grafting of SL on PAM to achieve functions of TR [29,30]. The large fracture elongation of 1250% and stronger mechanical strength of 85 kPa for TR electrolyte (Fig. 2b and Fig. S2) result from the rigid framework of PAM and the soft component of SA, as well as the covalent sacrificial network and the three-dimensional (3D) rigid benzene ring structure of SL [31]. TR electrolyte possesses the homogeneous pore structure after freeze drying (Fig. 2c), which is an essential function to adsorb Zn salt solution as gel electrolyte of Zn-I2 batteries. The uniform element distribution in EDS mapping images (Fig. S3), the presence of C, N, O, and S elements in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra (Figs. S4 and S5), and the even optical photographs (Fig. S6) further confirm the successful preparation of TR electrolyte. The abundant heteroatom groups in TR components generate the electron-rich locations to construct anion-rich structure of TR electrolyte (Fig. S7). The HER hinderance of TR is tested via linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and Tafel curves. The lower HER response potential of TR (Fig. 2d) than LE and PS is mainly because of the strong binding energy of abundant –OH, –COO–, and –SO3 groups with H2O molecules in TR to reduce hydrolysis kinetics, which is also confirmed by oxygen evolution reaction (OER) curves (Fig. S8) [32]. The higher corrosive potential (−0.027 V) and lower corrosive current (0.338 mA) of Zn anode with TR than LE (−0.040 V and 0.654 mA) and PS (−0.028 V and 0.403 mA) (Fig. 2e) demonstrate the poor anodic corrosion tendency and corrosion rate for Zn metal anode [33]. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation was adopted to quantitatively explore the hinderance of HER on Zn anode with TR electrolyte. The interactive energy of SA (−1.25 eV) and SL (−0.92 eV) components in TR with H2O molecules is significantly stronger than the intra-molecular hydrogen bonding interactions of H2O molecules (−0.31 eV) (Fig. 2f). The stretching vibration peak of O–H (H2O) in PS and TR electrolytes is red-shifted compared to that in the LE in Raman spectra (Fig. S9), as well as the degree of red-shift of TR is greater than that of PS, indicating that the interaction of H2O-H2O in the LE electrolyte is stronger than that in PS and TR electrolytes. The anion-rich groups in TR effectively disrupt the original hydrogen bonding pattern and reduce the activity of H2O molecules to hinder HER and OER [34]. The anticorrosion ability of Zn anode with TR during the plating and stripping processes is characterized by in-situ XRD and XPS technique. The weak XPS peak of S 2p (Fig. S10) of the cycled Zn anode with TR electrolyte indicate the positive effect of TR electrolyte on the avoidance of HER and the hindrance of Zn4SO4(OH)6·xH2O by-product formation, compared with LE and PS electrolytes (Fig. S11), which also can be seen in the in-situ XRD patterns (Fig. 2g) of Zn anode with high (002)/(100) peak intensity ratio. Moreover, the higher binding energy of SA (−24.93 and −25.54 eV) and SL (−22.88 and −23.25 eV) components in TR with Zn2+ ions than that of H2O molecules (−4.67 eV) facilitates the formation of adsorption and transport sites for Zn2+ to ensure the redox reaction of Zn2+ from the electrolyte to the electrode surface (Fig. 2h). The solvated structure of Zn2+ in LE is mainly composed of Zn(H2O)6 2+ and Zn(H2O)5SO4 via the calculation and simulation from molecular dynamics and radial distribution function (Fig. S12). The slow desolvation process exacerbates the corrosion caused by H2O on the electrode surface. The binding preference of TR electrolyte with Zn2+ ions can be identified in the vicinity of the active site within TR electrolyte (Fig. 2i). The coordination number of Zn2+ ions with H2O molecules decrease from 5.2 to 4.2, demonstrating that TR electrolyte modulates the solvated structure of Zn2+. The strong binding energy of TR with Zn2+ ions and the reduction of H2O activity can destroy the solvation of Zn(H2O)6 2+ and decrease the contact of active H2O with Zn metal to improve the anticorrosive ability of Zn anode, which is consistent with the aforementioned calculations. The hinderance of dendrite growth and the facilitation of uniform deposition behavior for TR electrolyte were investigated by ion conductivity, diffusion process, nucleation mechanism, and plating morphology. The higher ion conductivity of TR (21.43 mS cm−1) than that of PS (17.59 mS cm−1), PAM (14.36 mS cm−1), and SA (16.92 mS cm−1) in Fig. 3 (a) and Fig. S13 is attributed to the multi-site transportation of Zn2+ ions in TR matrix [35] and the high abundance of polarized sulfonic acid groups [36] after the addition of SL. The amorphous structure of TR in XRD (Fig. S14) also facilitates the improvement of ionic conductivity [37,38]. The high ionic conductivity plays an essential role in distributing ion flux to induce even deposition behavior and fast transportation of Zn2+ ions, which are tested by chronoamperometry (CA) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique [39]. Comparing with the continuous current increase for LE to find suitable protruding location, Zn anode with TR electrolyte can perform transitory two-dimensional (2D) diffusion with the rapid current reduction and achieve 3D diffusion with stable current (Fig. 3b), which can promote the uniform deposition of Zn2+ ions and hinder the growth of Zn dendrites. The higher nucleation overpotential (Fig. 3c) of Zn anode with TR and PS electrolytes (16 and 73 mV) than that of LE system facilitates the formation of more nucleation sites and finer crystalline grains, which can effectively prevent the formation of Zn dendrites [40]. The introduction of SL significantly improves the adhesion of TR on Zn anode, which is also a key factor to influence the electrolyte interface affinity. The adsorption energy of SL and H2O on Zn(002) surface was calculated by DFT calculations (Fig. 3d). The higher adsorption energy (−2.86 eV) of sulfonic acid groups in SL than H2O (−0.19 eV) on the electrode surface strengthens the adhesion between the electrode and the electrolyte. The adsorption ability of TR electrolyte on Zn anode is also confirmed by the adhesion experiments (Fig. S15) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements (Fig. S16). The actual deposition processes of Zn2+ ions on Zn anode were observed by the plating morphology on copper (Cu) foils (Fig. S17) and the synchronous plating behavior on Zn surface. The deposited Zn in LE (Fig. 3e and Fig. S18) and PS (Fig. 3f and Fig. S19) electrolyte exhibits rough and vertical morphology corresponding to preferential growth of Zn (100) plane, which evolve to notorious Zn dendrites after long-term cycling. Moreover, Cu electrode with TR electrolyte possesses the flat and parallel deposited layer (Fig. 3g and Fig. S20), suggesting that TR can uniform ion flux and regulate deposition behavior [41]. The real-time photographs at different plating times show the uneven deposition of Zn2+ ions on Zn anode with LE electrolyte (Fig. 3h), while Zn anode with TR electrolyte possesses the homogeneous deposition behavior and achieves uniform plated layer (Fig. 3i). The long-term plating and stripping reversibility of Zn anode with TR is verified by the Coulombic efficiency (CE) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (Fig. 3j and Fig. S21) for Zn-Cu batteries. Cu electrode with TR electrolyte exhibits stable plating/stripping behavior of 800 cycles and possesses high average CE of 99.57%, significantly better than that with LE (150 cycles) and PS (420 cycles) electrolyte, resulting from the positive effect of TR electrolyte on the hinderance of dendrite growth and HER. “Tennis racket” effect of TR electrolyte induces the uniform deposition of Zn2+ and hinders the HER and corrosion, which can enhance the plating/stripping reversibility of Zn metal anode. Zn-Zn symmetric cells were measured at current densities of 0.5 and 2 mA cm−2 with constant capacity of 0.5 and 2 mA h cm−2. Zn anode in TR can achieve a long-time cycling-life of 4500 h at 0.5 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4 a). The voltage-capacity curve at different cycles presents the high repeatability (Fig. 4b), confirming the positive effect of TR on the stable plating/stripping behavior for Zn anode. When the current density and the constant capacity increase to 2 mA cm−2 and 2 mA h cm−2, Zn anode in TR can achieve a long-time cycling-life of 1000 h (Fig. 4c), indicating that “tennis racket” effect of TR can effectively promote uniform Zn2+ deposition to avoid the formation of dendrite morphology and hinder HER to reduce the generation of insulative by-products. Nevertheless, the short circuit occurs after 150 h for Zn anode in LE at 2 mA cm−2, due to the uneven deposition derived dendrite to pierce the diaphragm. Moreover, PS based battery can uniform ion flux to hinder the dendrite growth, but the continuous formation of HER derived by-products increases voltage polarization for Zn anode in PS at 650 h. The comparation of the electrochemical properties with the reported works was summarized and listed in Fig. 4(d) and Table S1, demonstrating that Zn anode in TR can outperform the cycling life of many published works. The long-term deposition behavior of Zn anode was characterized by SEM and atomic force microscope (AFM). The vertical deposition and flaky by-product on the cycled Zn anode in LE reveal the uneven plating process and serious HER (Fig. 4e). Zn anode in PS can achieve the flat surface resulting from the even deposition behavior, but possess the obvious flaky by-products due to the occurrence of HER on Zn surface (Fig. 4f). The parallel hexagonal Zn and the inexistence of insulative by-products on Zn anode in TR indicate that the “tennis racket” effect of TR can induce the uniform deposition of Zn2+ ions to grow along with (002) plane and hinder HER to reduce by-product formation (Fig. 4g). The surface evenness of the cycled Zn anode was tested by AFM instrument. The surface roughness of the cycled Zn anode in LE demonstrates the uneven deposition and the serious corrosion (Fig. 4h). Zn anode in PS possesses some microprotrusion corresponding to HER-derived by-products (Fig. 4i), similar to the SEM results. Moreover, AFM image of the cycled Zn anode in TR displays the presence of the parallel hexagonal deposition layer (Fig. 4j), further confirming the positive effect of TR on uniform deposition behavior and hinderance HER. The commercial application of aqueous Zn-I2 batteries confronts HER and dendrite growth at anodic side, as well as I3 − shuttle from cathodic side to corrode Zn anode. The shuttle effect of I3 − ions was investigated by H-type electrolysis cell, ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectra, DFT, and SEM. For the traditional glass fiber (GF) separator (Fig. 5 a), the color of right chamber becomes light brown after 20 min and dark brown after 100 min, indicating the spontaneous diffusion of I3 − ions via concentration gradient. The corresponding UV-Vis spectra of right solution show the rapid increase of I3 − concentration from 0 to 100 min (Fig. 5b). PS electrolyte sustains the transparent color and weak I3 − peaks in right chamber before 6 h (Fig. S22), resulting from the suitable electrostatic repulsion capacity with I3 − ions. Nevertheless, the transparent color of right chamber after 6 h demonstrates the excellent hinderance ability of TR electrolyte to I3 − ions, as well as only a small amount of diffusion can be observed even after 30 h (Fig. 5c), indicating that “tennis racket” structure can generate electrostatic shield to repel I3 − ions. UV-Vis spectra also confirm that the I3 − concentration in right chamber increases slowly with time (Fig. 5d), indicating the positive effect of TR to restrain shuttle effect of I3 − ions. The repulsion mechanism of TR to I3 − ions was investigated by DFT calculation. The carboxyl and sulfonate groups in SL and SA components of TR electrolyte generate isotropic surface electrostatic potential (Fig. S23) to enhance the repulsion capacity to I3 − ions. The repulsion energies of SL and SA components in TR to I3 − ions were calculated to be 5.79 and 1.45 eV, suggesting that TR has a pronounced repulsive energy to I3 − ions (Fig. 5e). The abundant sulphonate (–SO3 2−) and carboxyl (–COOH) groups can generate electron-rich area to repulse I3 − ions. Moreover, the introduction of SL also reduces gel pore size and increase the electronegativity (Fig. S24). The cycled Zn anode in LE shows the obvious corrosive topography (Fig. S25), indicating the severe corrosion reaction of I3 − ions and H2O molecules. Moreover, Zn anode in TR possesses the flat and hexagonal morphology after cycling (Fig. S26), resulting from the repulsion effect of TR to I3 − ions. The self-discharge test of the Zn-I2 full battery with TR electrolyte shows a capacity retention of 98%, which is higher than that of PS (88%) and LE (73%), proving the excellent ability of the TR electrolyte to block the I3 − shuttle (Fig. S27). The electrochemical properties of Zn-I2 full batteries were investigated to confirm the positive effect of TR on the synchronous regulation of cathode and anode. CV curve for Zn-I2 full batteries in TR shows the excellent reversibility in Fig. S28. Subsequent calculations of different sweep speeds with corresponding peak currents reveal that the current is provided by capacitive and diffusion control at cathodic side [42–45]. A gradual increase in capacitive contribution from 6.9% to 35.7% at the sweep rate range of 0.5–10 mV s−1 indicates the enhanced charge transfer from the strong diffusion and capacitive control in TR in Figs. S29–S32. Zn-I2 batteries in TR possess the better rate performance from 0.1 to 10 A g−1 than that in LE and PS in Fig. 5(f) and Figs. S33 and S34, indicating the fast charge transfer kinetics in I2/C cathode and that TR electrolyte can facilitate the electron and ion transportation. The charge and discharge curves of Zn-I2 batteries in TR display the small polarization along with the increase of current density in Fig. 5(g), further confirming fast charge transfer kinetics behavior of TR in battery system. The longer cycling stability of 15000 cycles and the higher average coulombic efficiency of 99.8% for Zn-I2 batteries in TR than those in LE (3000 cycle) indicate that the synchronous regulation of TR on the anode and cathode can hinder dendrite growth and HER at anodic side and restrain I3 − shuttle at cathodic side (Fig. 5h and Fig. S35). The practicability of TR electrolyte was verified by assembling Zn-I2 pouch cells (Fig. 6 a). The Zn-I2 pouch battery with TR electrolyte and active I loading of 7 mg cm−2 achieves 290 stable cycles and a capacity of 130 mA h g−1 (Fig. 6b) at the current density of 1 A g−1, superior to LE based battery (70 cycles, 110 mA h g−1). The accumulation of HER derived hydrogen (H2) in LE pouch battery results in an observable bulge phenomenon to induce the deterioration of electrochemical performance, while the pouch battery with TR exhibits a complete structure without H2 production (illustrations of Fig. 6b). The galvanostatic charge/discharge curves of TR based pouch battery at the 2nd, 100th, and 200th cycle exhibit the obvious charge/discharge plateaus at 1.3 and 1.2 V in Fig. S26, which are in line with the coin cell. The prepared pouch batteries with TR can be connected in series to power light emitting diode (LED) lights, electronic clock, and even remote-control toy car (Fig. 6c). The good stability and safety of TR based pouch battery were tested by the voltage change under the bending and cutting states. The bending and cutting states can still maintain the initial voltage at about 1.3 V (Fig. 6d), indicating the safety of Zn-I2 pouch battery and the stability of TR electrolyte. Flexible batteries play an essential role for the development of wearable instruments. TR electrolytes with excellent flexibility can be used to assemble flexible Zn-I2 pouch batteries with I2 anode and Zn anode. The stability of flexible Zn-I2 batteries is tested after bending at different angles for charge/discharge cycles (Fig. 6e). The discharge capacity of flexible Zn-I2 batteries can be well maintained, demonstrating the excellent flexibility of TR electrolyte. The stable open-circuit voltage of flexible Zn-I2 batteries also confirms the feasibility of TR as flexible electrolyte (Fig. 6f). The practicability of flexible Zn-I2 batteries is verified by successfully powering wearable electronic screens, flexible headlamps, and led overalls (Fig. 6g). 3 Conclusions In summary, we developed a “tennis racket” (TR) hydrogel electrolyte to synchronously regulate anode-cathode electrolyte, in which “gridline structure” consists of covalently cross-links of PAM, the benzene ring of SL, and ionic cross-linking of SA. “Gridline structure” of TR electrolyte can uniform Zn2+ flux to inhibit dendrite growth and reduce active H2O to hinder HER at anode side. Meanwhile, anion-rich structure of TR electrolyte can hit I3 − ions as “tennis” for the hinderance of shuttle effect at cathode side. The above advantages of TR electrolyte endow Zn metal anode with reversible plating/stripping behavior of 4500 h and Zn-I2 batteries with long-term cycling performance of 15000 cycles. This work develops a novel strategy to enhance the electrochemical performance of Zn-I2 batteries by the construction of “tennis racket” hydrogel structure to achieve the synchronous regulation on cathode and anode.

        "dc:description": "Aqueous zinc-iodine (Zn-I2) batteries show great potential as energy storage candidates due to their high-safety and low-cost, but confronts hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendrite growth at anode side and polyiodide shuttling at cathode side. Herein, “tennis racket” (TR) hydrogel electrolytes were prepared by the co-polymerization and co-blending of polyacrylamide (PAM), sodium lignosulfonate (SL), and sodium alginate (SA) to synchronously regulate cathode and anode of Zn-I2 batteries. “Gridline structure” of TR can induce the uniform transportation of Zn2+ ions through the coordination effect to hinder HER and dendrite growth at anode side, as well as hit I3 − ions as “tennis” via the strong repulsion force to avoid shuttle effect at cathode side. The synergistic effect of TR electrolyte endows Zn-Zn symmetric battery with high cycling stability over 4500 h and Zn-I2 cell with the stably cycling life of 15000 cycles at 5 A g−1, outperforming the reported works. The practicability of TR electrolyte is verified by flexible Zn-I2 pouch battery. This work opens a route to synchronously regulate cathode and anode to enhance the electrochemical performance of Zn-I2 batteries.",
