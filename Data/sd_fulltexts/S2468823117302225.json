Graphical abstract K doping results in more active oxygen species, stronger oxygen absorption capacity and oxygen storage capacity of CeO2. CeO2-M was prepared by a Ce-MOF-template method and characterized using SEM, XRD, XPS, Raman, TEM, BET and O2-TPD. The SEM images and pore size distribution data showed that CeO2-M had a porous structure. The XRD, XPS, Raman and TEM results confirmed the appearance of K+ embedding substitution. The XPS and TPD data confirmed that much more active oxygen species and stronger adsorption oxygen capacity of CeO2-M. The OSC tests showed CeO2-M had a stronger oxygen storage capacity. The solid catalyst was evaluated for o-xylene oxidation at low temperature. CeO2-M had high catalytic performance, nearly 100% o-xylene conversion achieved at a GHSV of 120,000h−1 and o-xylene inlet concentration of 200ppm at 210°C, which was much better than that of CeO2-P and K/CeO2-P. The high catalytic performance is attributed to honeycomb texture, active oxygen species, strong oxygen adsorption capacity and strong oxygen storage capacity. Keywords Cerium oxide Catalytic oxidation o-xylene MOFs K 1 Introduction Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), one of the major air pollution, originating from outdoor sources and indoor sources, are harmful to human health [1,2]. Numerous technologies have been studied to control the emission of VOCs, such as adsorption, photocatalysis, plasma, etc. Among these techniques, catalytic oxidation is recognized as the most effective technology of VOCs removing. CeO2 has been widely studied on the synthesis of different morphology, such as nanoparticle, nanorod, nanocube, nanowire and etc. They exhibit different lattice planes which determine the ability to release and uptake oxygen [3–5]. Generally, low-indexed plane possesses a higher redox property. For example, the evidently enhanced activity for CO oxidation was observed on the reactive (100) plane, compared with the less reactive (110) and (111) planes [6]. It seemed that the active sites could be obtained by regulating the morphology of CeO2. There are many approaches for the synthesis of different morphology of CeO2, such as hydrothermal method (nanoparticle, nanorod, nanocube, nanowire, nanosphere and 3D dendrite) [3,7–9], precipitation method (nanorod and nanoflower) [10], soft template method (nanofibers) [11], hard template method (macrostructure and mesostructure) [12,13], etc. In recent years, Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have been used as hard templates or precursors (soft template) to prepare novel nanostructure metal oxides [14–17]. There are some nanomaterials successfully prepared, such as ZnO [18], CuO/CeO2 [17], Co3O4 [19], MnOx [20] and CoFe2O4 [21]. Among them, only MnOx was obtained by using Mn-MOF-74 as a precursor instead of a hard template host [20]. It is worth noting that the morphology and the crystal structures of the MnOx particles can be easily regulated by adjusting the thermolysis conditions. More recently, Ce-aph-MOF has been studied to prepare hierarchically nanoporous CeO2 by using aliphatic carboxylate ligands [22]. It is reasonable that novel morphology of CeO2 can be obtained by the thermolysis of other Ce-MOFs. However, the other Ce-MOFs are less studied on the synthesis of novel morphology of CeO2, even for catalytic oxidation. In this work, a simple route for the formation of CeO2 with honeycomb structure via the thermolysis of a Ce-MOF with 3D network based on the “16-crown-6-like” secondary building units (SBUs) is reported (CeO2-M). For comparison, the common CeO2 is prepared by the conventional precipitation (CeO2-P). The catalytic activities of CeO2-M and CeO2-P were measured for o-xylene oxidation. The physicochemical properties of the catalysts were investigated by N2 adsorption/desorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Raman spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and O2-TPD. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials The Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, Urea, KNO3 and ethanol (EtOH) were procured from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. N,N-Dimethylacetamide (DMAC) and 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (H2FDCA) were procured from Beijing HWRK Chem. Co., Ltd. All the chemicals were of analytical grade. 2.2 Preparation of Ce-MOFs, CeO2-M and CeO2-P Ce-MOF (KCe3(FDCA)5(H2O)5) was synthesized using a hydrothermal method [23]. Typically, a mixture of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (0.1mmol), H2FDCA (0.2mmol), KNO3 (0.1mmol) and DMAC/EtOH/H2O (v:v:v=1:1:1, 5mL) was placed in a capped vial (10mL) and heated at 95°C for 48h and then cooled to room temperature in 48h. Colourless crystals were obtained (yield: 50% based on Ce). The Ce-MOF was then calcined at 450°C for 4h at the ramping rate 5°C/min. Finally, the obtained powder was named CeO2-M from the MOF precursor. CeO2-P was named from the preparation of the precipitation method [24]. Typically, 18g Ce(NO3)3·6H2O was dissolved in distilled water, and then the solution was heated to 80°C and stirring. 50g urea was poured into the solution, stirring for 12h. Then the precipitate was washed and dried at 100°C. Finally, CeO2-P was obtained after calcined in air at 450°C for 4h. 6.4wt% K/CeO2-P was prepared by calcining the gel mixture of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, KNO3 and urea without water in air at 450°C for 4h. 2.3 Catalyst characterization The particle size and cell parameter “a” were estimated from X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns measured by a PANalytical X’Pert Pro diffractometer. A Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with a monochromatic Cu Kα source operated at 40kV and 40mA was used. The field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JSM-7001F) was used to study the morphology of the catalysts. Furthermore, the exposed lattice planes and the lattice spacings were measured by a JEOL JEM-2100 microscope, operating at 200kV. A Quantasorb-18 automatic equipment was used to determine the surface areas of the catalysts at liquid nitrogen temperature (77K). The surface element valence states of Ce, O and K were recorded and analysed by X-ray photoemission (XPS) measurements on a Scanning X-ray Microprobe (AXIS Ultra, Kratos Analytical, Inc.). Binding energy was calibrated with C1s=284.8eV. The atomic ratio of Ce and K were measured by PerkinElmer Optima 8300. The Raman spectra of the CeO2 samples were measured by a Raman spectrophotometer (Renishaw RM2000). The oxygen temperature programmed desorption (O2-TPD) tests were carried out on a Micromeritics Auto chem II 2920 with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MKS, Cirrus™2). The catalyst (20mg) was pretreated in an air flow at room temperature for 30min. After that, He gas was used at 30mLmin−1 for 50min to purge any residual oxygen. The catalyst was then heated to 650°C at a constant heating rate of 20°Cmin−1. The mass signals of O2 (m/z =32) was detected by the mass spectrometer during the heated process. The oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of the catalysts was measured by a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA Q600, TA Instrument). In each run, the catalyst (20mg) was heated to 800°C at a constant heating rate of 5°Cmin−1 in an air flow (100mLmin−1), then cooled down to 150°C. After that, the catalyst was heated to 800°C again. The weight loss of the second heated process assigned to the oxygen storage capacity. 2.4 Catalytic performance of the catalysts The catalytic performances of the catalysts were examined at the temperature range from 90 to 300°C. In each run, the catalyst was packed with 100mg in a quartz microreactor. The flow rate was 100mL/min composed with 200ppm o-xylene and air. The composition and concentration of outlet gas was detected by a GC (Agilent GC7820, Carbo PLOT P7 and DB-WAXETR column) with two FID detectors. The carbon balance was analyzed from the reactant and production detected at outlet gas. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 The Ce-MOF template Fig. 1 showed the XRD pattern of Ce-MOF. It can be seen that the XRD pattern of KCe3(FDCA)5(H2O)5 (Ce-MOF) matches well with its simulated one, indicating that Ce-MOF was pure phase. The variation in the peak intensities between the simulated and experimental patterns was caused by the superior orientation of Ce-MOF. In Ce-MOF, the Ce3+ ions are bridged with OCO of FDCA2− ligands to form a one-dimensional (1D) chain with two Ce1 atoms and two Ce2 atoms alternating (Fig. 2 A). The distances of neighbouring Ce3+ ions are 4.331(1) and 5.456(1)Å. Then chains link each other through FDCA2− ligands to generate a two-dimensional (2D) sheet. Interestingly, two FDCA2− ligands are nearly coplanar to build a ‘16-crown-6-like’ structure and one potassium ion lies within the ‘crown ether’ with K⋯O lengths in the range 2.648(3) to 3.029(3)Å in the 2D sheet. The ‘16-crown-6-like’ structure can be seen as a SBU linking six Ce ions (Fig. 2B). More interestingly, each Ce3 atom is coordinated with five carboxylate oxygen donors from five FDCA2− ligands and three water molecules. Four of five carboxylate groups behave as a μ2-bridge to bind two Ce3 atoms together, resulting in a Ce2 unit with a close Ce3⋯Ce3 contact of 4.269(2)Å (Fig. 2C). Then the Ce2 unit connects twelve Ce atoms by six FDCA2− ligands forming a hexapod support the 2D sheet being a three-dimensional (3D) structure (Fig. 2D). The PLATON analysis revealed that the 3D porous structure contains large voids of 1009.4Å3 that represent 36.2% volume per unit cell when the guests are removed. 3.2 The CeO2 samples 3.2.1 The structural characterization Fig. 3 A and B presented the morphology of the catalysts, the surface of CeO2-M showed honeycomb texture morphology, while CeO2-P showed sheets morphology, implying that the surface of CeO2-M has a porous structure. From the pore size distribution (Fig. 3D), there are sharp peaks at 3.8nm on CeO2-M and CeO2-P which are ghost peaks [25]. Therefore, discarding that peak, CeO2-M was found to have a pore size distribution with a primary pore diameter of 5–12nm because of Type H4 loops feature (Fig. 3C). CeO2-P showed a pore size distribution from 5 to 30nm due to aggregates of plate like particles with slit shape pores due to Type H3 hysteresis loops. It indicated the presence of mesopore structure on the catalysts. The surface area (64m2/g) of CeO2-M was lower than that (120m2/g) of CeO2-P (Table 1 ). The abnormal phenomenon was reported between bulk and 3D mesoporous Co3O4, suggesting that the surface area is not the main constraint on the reaction [26]. Therefore, CeO2-M has a porous structure on the surface which formed after the thermolysis of the Ce-MOF. 3.2.2 The crystalline structure characterization Fig. 4 A showed the XRD patterns of the CeO2 catalysts. As shown in Fig. 4A, they both exhibited the diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 28.7°, 33.2°, 47.6°, 44.5°, 56.5°, 59.2°, and 69.6°. After XRD Rietveld analysis, there are found only CeO2 (JCPDS PDF 34-0394), indicating that the formation of crystalline cerium oxide after the thermolysis treatment. The intensity of the diffraction peaks decreased and the peak width at half height broadened of CeO2-M. Also, the 2θ of XRD peaks of CeO2-M were shifted to smaller angle. The same phenomenon was observed in Ce1-xLaxO2, indicating the doping of some bigger ion species (Mn+) in the lattice of CeO2 [27]. This result was confirmed by the presence of K+ from the XPS data (Fig. 4B). From the XPS spectra, an obvious difference between CeO2-M and CeO2-P is that K+ (376.5eV and 292.7eV) exists on CeO2-M, which is generally located at the binding energy of 377.4±0.2eV [28]. The negative shift was caused by the electron transferred to the K atom, which reconfirms K+ embedding substitution. The radius of K+ (0.133nm) is bigger than that of Ce4+ (0.087nm) and Ce3+ (0.103nm). When some Ce3+ or Ce4+ ions were replaced by K+, the lattice parameter would become larger. As shown in Table 1, the lattice constant of CeO2-P (a) is close to 0.5412nm (JCPDS 34-0394). In contrast, the lattice parameter of CeO2-M was much larger than that. The larger lattice parameters approved of the K doping in CeO2. It is demonstrated that the template method may lead K+ to embed in the lattice of CeO2 and reduce the surface relaxation, leading to produce defect sites, such as oxygen vacancy [29,30]. The TEM images of CeO2-M and CeO2-P were recorded. As shown in Fig. 5 A, CeO2-M exposed the lattice planes of (111), (220) and (200). Their spacings correspond to 0.333nm, 0.205nm and 0.281nm. All these spacings are much larger than that (0.316nm, 0.190nm and 0.270nm) of CeO2 −P (Fig. 5B). The lager lattice spacings were also caused by K+ addition. Fig. 5C showed the Raman spectral profiles of the catalysts. There are two peaks from 200 to 800cm−1, one strong peak at 481cm−1 and one weak peak at about 461cm−1. The strong peak corresponds to the glass. The weak band at 461cm−1 is assigned to the stretching mode (F2g mode) of Ce-O8 vibrational unit. Obvious, the CeO2-M sample showed broader peak (F2g) than CeO2-P. In addition, the F2g Peak of CeO2-M is located at 458cm−1, lower shift than that (461cm−1) of CeO2-P. These results mean the disorderliness in the O atom, due to the incorporation of K+ in CeO2 for the charge balance [31,32]. It can be inferred that the crystalline structure of CeO2-M was changed by K+ embedding substitution, resulting in larger parameter, larger lattice spacings and O disorderliness. 3.2.3 The oxygen species From O 1s XPS spectra (in Fig. 6 A), there are three peaks (OI, 529.0±0.2eV; OII, 531.1±0.2eV; OIII, 533.3±0.2eV), belonging to lattice oxygen species (O2−), activated oxygen species (O− and O2 −) and absorbed oxygen species, respectively [28,33]. Table 2 showed the atomic concentration of Ce, O, K and their atomic ratios. The atomic ratio (1.71) of active oxygen species (OII and OIII)/lattice oxygen (OI) on CeO2-M is much higher than that (1.13) of CeO2-P. Furthermore, the atomic ratio (3.19) of O/Ce on CeO2-P catalysts remarkably rises up to 6.12 on CeO2-M. In addition, the atomic ratio (0.22) of absorbed oxygen species (OIII)/oxygen (OI, OII and OIII) on CeO2-M is twice as much as that (0.11) of CeO2-P, meaning much stronger adsorption capacity of oxygen species on CeO2-M. Fig. 6B presents the O2-TPD profiles of the catalysts. The desorption of O2 (m/z =32) was detected, contributed to the absorbed oxygen. There are two peaks of O2 desorption centered at 90°C and 550°C of CeO2-M. Obvious, it is found that the only small peak of O2 desorption is centered at 110°C of CeO2-P, which is higher than CeO2-M. This reconfirms that CeO2-M has stronger adsorption capacity of oxygen, which are in agreement with the results from O 1s XPS analysis. The oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of CeO2 is important for its higher catalytic efficiency. As shown in Table 2, the OSC of 34μmolmg−1 was obtained for CeO2-M as compared to 9.7μmolmg−1 for CeO2-P. It can be inferred that the K+ addition on CeO2-M is the reason for its higher oxygen storage capacity as compared to CeO2-P. These results suggested that K+ addition evidently improved the oxygen adsorption capacity and the generation of active oxygen species. Also, K+ addition evidently enhanced the oxygen storage capacity. Therefore, K+ embedding substitution resulted in more active oxygen species, stronger oxygen adsorption capacity and stronger oxygen storage capacity of CeO2-M. 3.2.4 Catalytic activity The catalytic activities of the catalysts were shown in Fig. 7 A. Obviously, catalytic performance of CeO2-M was much better than that of CeO2-P and the reported CeO2-NR [29]. In order to evaluate the catalytic performance, the reaction temperatures T10%, T50%, T90% and T100% (the temperature at 10%, 50%, 90%, 100% o-xylene conversion, respectively) were summarized in Table 3 . The initiation temperature (T10%) value of 123°C for o-xylene oxidation was achieved over CeO2-M, whereas the T10% value was 225°C of CeO2-P. CeO2-M was nearly 100% o-xylene conversion achieved at a gas hour space velocity (GHSV) of 120,000h−1 and o-xylene inlet concentration of 200ppm at 210°C. In this test, the products were CO2 and H2O and the CO2 selectivity was 99.5±5%. The curves of CO2 production were shown in Fig. 7B, and it exhibited the similar trend with the o-xylene conversion. The weight of K in CeO2-M is 6.4%, measured by ICP-MS. The 6.4wt%K/CeO2-P was prepared and tested for o-xylene oxidation. As shown in Fig. 7, it exhibited lower activity than CeO2-M, but a little better activity than pure CeO2-P, indicating the K species and CeO2 had a positive cooperativity for o-xylene oxidation. That is to say, K+ species embedding substitution showed much stronger positive cooperativity than the weak interaction between K and CeO2 prepared by a sol-gel method. Obviously, as shown in Table 3, CeO2-M presented much higher specific activity (526×10−7 mols−1 m−2) than that (2.1×10−7 mols−1 m−2) of CeO2-P, indicating that this oxidation reaction is sensitive to the pore structure. 3.3 Discussion According to characterization results, the Ce-MOF has ordered 3D framework, during the thermolysis process, the organic ligands induce the self-templating effect to form a surface honeycomb texture structure of CeO2-M catalyst [22]. In Ce-MOF, the O atom of −OCO group are bonded with Ce3+ and K+ simultaneously (Fig. 2). Therefore, it is reasonable that the K+ species were embedded in the lattice of CeO2 after the template removal. This means the position of Ce4+ would be replaced by K+. Consequently, the K+ embedding substitution resulted in larger lattice constant and larger lattice spacing of ceria from XRD and TEM. The XPS, TPD and OSC results showed that K+ embedding substitution gave more active oxygen species and stronger oxygen storage capacity. For o-xylene oxidation, the CeO2-M catalysts showed higher activity than the CeO2-P catalyst. Therefore, it can be concluded that the template effect on the preparation of the catalyst played a very important role for the formation of surface honeycomb texture structure and K+ embedding substitution. The K+ embedding substitution generated more active oxygen species and stronger oxygen storage capacity. The surface honeycomb texture structure, active oxygen species, oxygen adsorption capacity and oxygen storage capacity are responsible for the effective catalytic performance of CeO2-M for o-xylene oxidation. 4 Conclusions In virtue of the self-templating effect, the honeycomb texture structure and the K+ species embedding substitution formed after the thermal treatment of Ce-MOF. K+ species embedding substitution generate more active oxygen species. Therefore, CeO2-M catalyst showed more efficient activity for o-xylene oxidation than CeO2-P and K/CeO2-P due to: (1) the morphology is conducive to the adsorption and diffusion of the VOCs molecules; (2) the K+ species embedding substitution increases more active oxygen species, stronger oxygen adsorption capacity and stronger oxygen storage capacity. Therefore, the interaction between K+ and CeO2 displayed a very important role to the excellent performance.
