M. Deshpande and R. V. Chaudhari** Chemical Engineering Division, National Chemical Laboratory, Pune (India) (Received April 10, 1990; accepted September 5, 1990) Abstract The kinetics of hydroformylation of vinyl acetate using [Rh(CO)2Cl]z complex catalyst has been investigated at 80 C. The trends are quite different from those observed for the HRh(CO)(PPh3)g-catalyzed systems. The dependence of the rate on P(Hz) and P(CO) was found to be linear, whereas the dependence of rate on vinyl acetate concentration was found to be first order, followed by substrate-inhibited kinetics at higher olefin concentrations. The rate dependence on the catalyst concentration was found to be fractional order. A rate equation has been proposed and kinetic parameters evaluated. Introduction Hydroformylation of vinyl acetate is important, since it provides a new route for the synthesis of 1,2 propanediol. The stoichiometric reactions involved are: CH2=CH-OAc + CO + H; OHC-CHa-CHaOAc (I) (i) CHa-CH-OAc (II) CHO CH3-CH-OAc + Hz \" CH3-CH-OAc (in) (ii) CHO CHpH CHa-CH OAc + H^O > CH3 CH OH (IV) (m) CHO CHaOH 1,2 propanediol In previous studies [1 4] on this reaction, the activity and selectivity of several catalysts involving Co and Rh complexes, have been reported. In *NCL Communication No. 4884. \"Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/91/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 144 our earlier work [4], the kinetics of hydroformylation of vinyl acetate has been studied using HRh(CO)(PPh3)g catalyst. It was observed that the reaction was first order with Hg and catalyst, while with CO and vinyl acetate a substrate-inhibited kinetics was observed under certain conditions. These observations also revealed trends consistent with other reports on the kinetics of hydroformylation of 1-hexene and allyl alcohol using HRh(CO)(PPh3)3 catalyst [5, 6]. In this paper, we report several new trends in the kinetics of hydro- formylation of vinyl acetate using [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 catalyst. For this purpose, experimental data on the effect of catalyst and olefin concentrations, and of CO and Hg partial pressures, on the rate of hydroformylation have been studied. Several forms of rate equations were considered to represent a suitable rate model, and a possible reaction mechanism has been discussed. Experimental The details of the materials used and the experimental procedure followed were identical to those described in our earlier paper [4]. The catalyst [Rh(CO)2Cl]a was prepared by the procedure given by McLeverty andWilkinson [7]. Results and discussion Preliminary studies The hydroformylation of vinyl acetate using [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 complex catalyst was found to give mainly the isomers of acetoxypropionaldehyde (I and II) as products under the reaction conditions employed (at 80 C). At higher temperatures (>90 C), traces of side-products such as acrolein and acetic acid were observed. In order to determine the kinetic behavior of the overall hydroformylation reaction, rate data were obtained at 80 C, at which the selectivity of the aldehyde products was greater than 95%. The reactions were carried out under differential conditions (e.g. con- version of vinyl acetate <10%), and the consumption of (CO+Hg) was monitored as a function of time. The initial and final concentrations of reactants and products were analyzed in each experiment. On comparison of the consumption of (CO+Hg), vinyl acetate and the products formed, the mass balance was found to be 94%, as per the stoichiometry. The rates of reaction were calculated from the absorption-time data as follows: _ slope of (CO + Ha) consumed vs. time plot A- volume of liquid Following this procedure, the effects of catalyst and vinyl acetate con- centration, as well as the partial pressures of CO and Hg were investigated 145 at 80 C. Typical plots of (CO+Hg) absorbed vs. time are shown in Figs. 1 to 4, for different P(H), P(CO), catalyst and vinyl acetate concentrations. The solubility data for CO in the reaction medium was obtained from the literature [8], while that of Hg was experimentally determined as per the procedure described elsewhere [ 9 ]. The values of the Henry's Law constants HA (hydrogen), and Hs (carbon monoxide) were found to be 4.26X10\"6, and 10.02X10\"6 mol cm\"3 atm~1 respectively. Since the hydroformylation involves reaction of two gases in a liquid, it was important to ensure that the rate data obtained were in the kinetic regime, and mass transfer effects were negligible. To check this, the effect of agitation speed on the rate of reaction was investigated and the results are shown in Fig. 5. The hydroformylation rate was found to be independent of agitation speed, even at the highest catalyst concentration studied. As a further confirmation, the rates of reaction were compared with the maximum rates of mass transfer under reaction conditions, following the procedure described elsewhere [6]. It was found that the observed rates of reaction were much less than the mass transfer rates and hence, the data were in the kinetic regime. Fig. 1.

Hydroformylatlon of vinyl acetate using IRh(CO)aCl)a catalyst: effect of P(CO). The effect of Ha partial pressure was studied at P(CO) of 20.4 atm, with catalyst and vinyl acetate concentrations of 1.0xl0~6 and 9.7xl0~4 mol cm\"3, respectively, and the results are presented in Fig. 6. The rate was found to increase linearly with PCE^). In order to explain these results, let us consider a mechanism of hydroformylation as shown in Fig. 7. According to this scheme, the rate of hydroformylation will show a linear dependence on PCHg) when step (VI), involving oxidative addition of Hg to acylcarbonyl Rh species (E), is the rate-determining step. The effect of partial pressure of CO on the rate of reaction was studied at catalyst and olefin concentrations of 1.0 x 10~6 and 9.7X 10~4 mol cm\"3, respectively, and PCHg) of 20.4 atm, and the results are presented in Fig. 8. The dependence of rate on CO partial pressure was linear up to 34 atm P(CO) and is quite unusual in view of the substrate inhibition observed with CO in almost all the previous studies with Rh catalysts [4-6]. In our earlier investigations on PPha-modified Rh catalysts [4], the rate was observed to be severely inhibited in the range of P(CO) studied here (up to 34 atm). The positive dependence of the rate on P(CO) indicates that with the catalyst [RhCCOaClla, the formation of acyi tricarbonyl Rh species (step VII in Fig. 147 0-15- 0-10 0-05 0 20 40 60 80 TIME,min Fig. 3. Hydroformylation of vinyl acetate using [RhCCOaClla catalyst: effect of [RhCCC^Clla. 7) is negligible, and hence no inhibition of the rate is observed. In this situation, the formation of an acyi Rh species (steps IV and V in Fig. 7) will be enhanced by higher P(CO) and hence, a linear first-order dependence. The effect of vinyl acetate concentration on the rate of hydroformylation was studied at a catalyst concentration of 1.0 X 10~6 mol cm\"3, and P(CO) and P(Ha) of 20.4 atm. The trend observed was again quite different (as shown in Fig. 9) from the earlier work with HRh(CO)(PPh3)3 catalyst [4]. The rate varied with vinyl acetate concentration with a first-order, followed by a negative-order, dependence, after passing through a maximum. In previous investigations using HRh(CO)(PPh3)3 catalyst [4-6] the rate of hydrofor- mylation was found to be severely inhibited at higher olefin concentrations. In the case of [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 catalyst, although chelation with vinyl acetate to form a stable species (Bl in Fig. 7) is possible, it is likely that it is not predominant (as in the case of HRh(CO)(PPh3)3 catalyst [4]), leading to only mild inhibition of the rate at higher vinyl acetate concentrations. The effect of catalyst concentration on the rate of reaction was investigated at -P(CO)=P(H2)=20.4 atm and a vinyl acetate concentration of 9.7X 10~4 mol cm\"3, and is shown in Fig. 10. The overall reaction was found to vary 148 0.15 0-10 0-05 40 TIME,min Pig. 4.

Effect of concentration of catalyst on the rate of reaction. Kinetic model In order to develop a suitable rate equation, first a rate equation derived based on the mechanism shown in Fig. 7 was considered. Considering step (VI) as rate-determining, the following form of rate equation was derived, based on the assumption of steady state. RA =-K'iA*{Cfi:2B*D[ 1 +KyD +J?4B*D])2 + CB^C}0-5 - C^2B*D[1 +KaD +K^B*D]) (v) This equation is too complex to fit the rate data, and also the observed trends cannot be realized from this model. Since the mechanism in Fig. 7 is not yet well established by suitable evidence for all the steps, and considering the complex nature of the rate form, it was thought appropriate to consider simplified empirical rate equations which are consistent with the observed trends. The various rate equations were considered and the rate parameters were evaluated using an optimization technique [10]. The results are shown in Table 1. From the values of <^>n,in, the sum of the squares of the difference between observed and predicted rates, the following model was found to fit the data satisfactorily: R- /cA*B*CD (vi) X X X X X X X tO \" < OS 00 OS <* CO 10 os so ao to <o ^ ^ ?0 0 '\"\"< 10 05 CSi 10 -; C- W OS TO t0 >d < > '-< e6 N co cd 1- ft ^ W CO W W 0000000 !--< < i l yw^ |-^ f-~( ^ X X X X X X X Oa \"i ^ N ^ '-< 0 ro ifl c~ ifl to TO Oi rt lf3 ^ 0 W <f ^1 0 >q t- 0 -< <<; CO \" id ri >-< 10 ia c6 0000000 ^ I < ^^ 1-^ * < T~< 1 < X X X X X X X 0 00 0 <' <-< 10 ^ os to c~ os ro in oa <?i t~ < co oa os SO <f OS 00 ; I; -< 00 l~ CO CO 0000000 l t ^4 1 < 1-^ 1-\"< ^^ T-< X X X X X X X o <a <-< co y i-< os i-] W SO OS <f CO 0 t~ ^i >o o t~ ro '-' 0 N CO <!; OS N 0 -^ ^' co -< ^ c<i 1 a-. .

Conclusions The hydroformylation of vinyl acetate using homogeneous [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 complex catalyst was investigated at 80 C. The trends observed were different from those observed in the case of HRh(CO)CPPh3)3 complex catalyst. The dependence of the rate on hydrogen as well as carbon monoxide was found to be linear in the range of conditions investigated. The dependence of the rate on olefin concentration passed through a maximum and showed substrate- inhibited kinetics at higher olefin concentrations. The rate dependence on the catalyst concentration was found to be fractional-order. A rate equation has been proposed.
