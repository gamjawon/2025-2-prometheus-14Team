NiFe-based materials offer tailorable electronic structure and exhibit promising performance in alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Electron-rich earth metals as doping species can regulate the local electronic configuration of NiFe-based catalysts towards improved HER activity. Herein, a low electronegative Mg dopant strategy is utilized to prepare Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx electrocatalyst for HER. The introduction of Mg improves the bonding strength of Fe-O bond in FeOOH active species, resulting in rapid H2O dissociation and improved stability. Meanwhile, Mg-dopant induces a downshift in the d-band center of FeOOH, which weakens the hydrogen adsorption for promoted H2 production. The Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx catalyst shows an ultra-low HER overpotential of 18 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and excellent stability in 1.0 M KOH. Moreover, the anion-exchange membrane water electrolyzer reaches 500 mA cm-2 at 1.70 V. This study provides a practical strategy to synthesise high-efficiency NiFe-based HER catalysts.

The production of sustainable green hydrogen through electrochemical water splitting has received significantly attention [2]. As a half-reaction, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) requires the synthesis of efficient catalysts to overcome the energy barrier of water dissociation and unsuitable hydrogen intermediate (H*) adsorption process in HER [3]. The most efficient HER catalysts are Pt-based materials, but the high cost has severely restricted their practical application [4]. The non-precious NiFe-based catalysts feature with tailorable electronic structure usually exhibit good alkaline water splitting performance, but their HER kinetics are limited by unfavorable dissociation of H2O and H* adsorption [5–8]. Therefore, optimizing catalytic active sites of NiFe-based catalysts with favorable H2O dissociation and H* adsorption is crucial for promoting their HER performance [9–11]. In recent years, various strategies, including heteroatoms doping [12–14], oxygen vacancy construction [15,16], phase structure regulation [17,18] and induced lattice strain [19,20], are adopted to adjust the electronic structure of NiFe-based catalysts to enhance their HER activity and stability. Among them, heteroatoms doping can tailor the d orbital electronic states of NiFe-based compounds and benefit the desorption process of adsorbed H* species, thus promoting the kinetics of HER steps [21–24]. In addition, introducing low electronegative dopants into NiFe-based catalysts would modify the local charge distribution and enrich the electron density on the catalyst surface, and thus lowering the energy barrier of H2O dissociation step in HER [25–27]. Low electronegative metals, such as alkaline earth metals (Mg, Ca and Sr), are usually employed for this purpose [28,29]. Notably, the Mg2+ ion radius (0.66 Å) is closely approximates that of Fe3+ (0.64 Å), which allows for easier substitution with Fe sites and stabilization of the bulk crystal [30]. Accordingly, the development of Mg-dopant in NiFe-based HER catalysts and unveiling its working mechanism would be interesting but has been rarely explored. In this work, a Mg-doping strategy is adopted to develop a nanorod structured Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx catalyst for HER. The electronic modulation impact of Mg-dopant was examined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The HER activity origin of Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx was studied by in-situ Raman analysis. In addition, in-situ infrared analysis and theoretical calculations were conducted to explore the HER kinetics. Electrochemical performance analysis reveals the Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx catalyst exhibits high activity and stability for HER. The practical application of Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx was further demonstrated in anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolyzer. This study offers a promising strategy for developing high-performance NiFe-based HER electrocatalysts. 2 Experiment and computational detail 2.1 Chemicals Nickel chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2 6H2O, 99 %, AR, Aladdin), anhydrous magnesium chloride (MgCl2, 99 %, AR, Bidepharm), potassium hydroxide (KOH, 85 %, AR, Kermel), ethanol (C2H5OH, 99.7 %, AR, Kermel), iron foam (FF) and Ar (99.99 %, Sizhi Gas, Tianjin, China) were used as received. 2.2 Sample preparation 2.2.1 Preparation of Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx and FeOOH/NiFeOx The FF (1 × 1.5 cm2) was washed with 1.0 M HCl and cleaned with ethanol and deionized water. Meanwhile, 15 mmol NiCl2 6H2O and 7.5 mmol MgCl2 was dissolved in 30 mL deionized water under magnetic stirring. The FF was placed in the above solution under magnetically stirring for 2.5 h. In this process, the FF was oxidized to Fe2+ ions, and the dissolved oxygen in the water might react with Fe2+ to form FeOOH [31,32]. Following this, the product was cleaned using ethanol and deionized water. It was then dried at 60 °C. The sample was then heated to 600 °C in Ar atmosphere for 2 h to obtain Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx [33,34]. The mass loading of the prepared Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx catalyst is 2 mg cm-2. The Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx catalyst is consist of Fe2O3, NiFe2O4, and amorphous FeOOH. Note that, some of FeOOH speices lose their crystal ordering at high temperature treatment, resulting in the formation of amorphous FeOOH phase [35]. A control sample FeOOH/NiFeOx was fabricated in the absence of MgCl2, in which no Fe-containing salt was added in the preparation of the two catalyst samples, and the Fe-dopant was sourced from the dissolved Fe ions from FF substrate. 2.2.2 Preparation of Pt/C/FF and Ir/C/FF The commercial Pt/C (2 mg) or Ir/C (2 mg) were firstly dispersed in 1 mL ethanol and 40 μL Nafion solution (5 wt%). Continuous sonication for at least 30 min was applied. The prepared catalyst ink was then dropped onto FF (1 × 1 cm2) with a mass loading of 2 mg cm-2 Pt/C or Ir/C catalyst. Such an ink-coated FF would serve as reference working electrode. 2.3 Physical characterization The Quanta 450 FEG electron microscope was used to capture the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. The JEM2100F field emission electron microscope was used to perform transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and elemental mapping imaging. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was executed using a D8 Discover instrument. The 20–80° angular range was used for the XRD analyses. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) equipment used was the ESCALAB 250Xi instrument. The dynamic evolution of the electrocatalyst was investigated using in-situ Raman (inVia Reflex) with a 532 nm excitation source operating in the 200–800 cm-1 range. Utilizing the Bruker device with an MCT detector chilled by liquid nitrogen, in-situ attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) investigation was carried out between 1000 and 4000 cm-1 range. 2.4 Electrochemical analysis A CHI 760E electrochemical workstation was utilized to perform the electrochemical analysis in 1.0 M KOH. The 20 wt% Ir/C catalyst was coated on FF. The reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potentials were calculated according to the following equation: ERHE (V) = ESCE + 0.0591 × pH + 0.241. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) analysis was conducted at 10 mV s-1 with 90 % iR compensation [36]. The electrochemical double layer capacitance (Cdl) of the CVs was evaluated in a non-Faradaic zone, and was used to compute the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) according to the following equation: ESCA = Cdl/Cs, where Cs represents the specific capacitance (40 µF cm-2). To calculate the solution resistance (Rs) and charge transfer resistance (Rct), an equivalent circuit was employed with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) being collected at various overpotentials throughout the frequency range of 10 Hz to 1000 kHz. Chronopotentiometric (i-t) curves were used to assess the stability of the catalysts. The anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolyzer was tested in 1.0 M KOH at 60 °C. The commercial membrane FAA-PK-130 was pretreated in 1.0 M KOH. 2.5 Density functional theory (DFT) calculation The DFT calculations were performed using the VASP software with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)-based PBE functional. The convergence test for the k-points mesh was provided, which confirmed the rationality of the Monkhorst-Pack 2 × 2 × 1 k-point mesh used in the present study (Figure S1) [37,38]. The cutoff for plane-wave kinetic energy is 400 eV. There is a vacuum height of 15 Å between the periodic slab. The energy and force convergence criteria were set to 10- 5 eV and 10- 5 eV/Å, respectively. The DFT+U calculations, first presented by Dudarev et al., were used to modify the Hubbard U term using U-J parameters of 5.0 for Fe atoms [5,37]. Based on in-situ Raman analysis, the actual catalytic phase α-FeOOH and Mg-(α-FeOOH) were utilized in the calculations. To construct the Mg-(α-FeOOH) model, one Fe atom was substituted by Mg atom in the α-FeOOH slab. During DFT calculations, H atom was placed at the top of the α-FeOOH and Mg-(α-FeOOH), and H atom tended to be adsorbed by O atom. Until the force on all unbound atoms was less than 10- 5 eV/atom, the atom positions were considered optimized. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx morphology and composition The schematic of Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx synthesis process is displayed in Fig. 1 a. Briefly, the nanorod structured Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx is grown on FF substrate through simple corrosion and calcination process. The introduction of low electronegativity Mg serves to strengthen the Fe-O bond in the α-FeOOH active species, which would favor the rapid H2O dissociation in alkaline HER. It is expected that the Mg-dopant facilitates a reduction in the energy barrier for H2 generation and improves HER kinetics in alkaline media. The catalyst morphology is investigated through SEM and TEM. The FeOOH/NiFeOx shows irregular arrangement of nanorods with different sizes on the FF surface (Figure S2). As shown in Fig. 1b-c, Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx exhibits uniformly distributed nanorods on the FF surface with a diameter about 20 nm and a length of 500 nm. Additionally, the (311) plane of spinel NiFe2O4 and Fe2O3 with a lattice spacing of 0.252 and 0.251 nm, respectively, is observed in the HRTEM image (Fig. 1d and Figure S3) [39–41]. Furthermore, the amorphous phase area is speculated to be α-FeOOH. These results agree with the findings of the SAED pattern (Figure S4). The Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx nanorod has a homogeneous arrangement of Fe, Ni, Mg, and O element, as shown by the elemental mapping in Fig. 1e. 3.2 Catalyst surface evolution In Fig. 2 a, the XRD patterns of FeOOH/NiFeOx and Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx agree well with that of NiFe2O4 (PDF #54–0964) and Fe2O3 (PDF #39–1346), respectively. Compared to FeOOH/NiFeOx, no Mg-related crystalline species are observed in Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx. The NiFeOx peaks near 45° and 52° become weaker, indicating that Mg is doped into the NiFeOx lattice [42]. The Mg composition determined by XPS was 0.41 at% (Table S1). The existence of Fe2O3 and NiFe2O4 is also verified by their featured Raman vibration modes located at 390, 499 and 689 cm-1 [39,40,43]. Furthermore, a featured signal for α-FeOOH at 672 cm-1 is observed in Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 2b) [44]. This observation provides additional support for the formation of amorphous α-FeOOH species in Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx catalyst. The chemical state and electronic structure of the catalysts are investigated using XPS. The results also indicate the existence of Ni, Fe, O and Mg in the Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx (Figure S5). In Fig. 2c, both the Ni 2p spectra of Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx and FeOOH/NiFeOx show the same characteristic peaks of 856.3 (2p3/2) and 873.9 eV (2p1/2) of Ni2+, implying a stable Ni2+ state in both catalysts. Fig. 2d shows that the peaks of Fe 2p at 711.1 and 724.4 eV are attributable to Fe3+ 2p3/2 and Fe3+ 2p1/2, and the peaks at 709.5 and 722.6 eV are assigned to Fe2+ 2p3/2 and Fe2+ 2p1/2, respectively [5]. After the introduction of Mg-dopant, the Fe3+ peaks exhibit a positive shift (0.5 eV), suggesting Fe species in Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx are in a highly oxidised state, facilitating the electron gain/loss of the reaction intermediates [45,46]. Fig. 2e displays the Mg 1s XPS spectra of Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx, where the Mg2+ state is responsible for the signal at 1304.7 eV[28]. In Fig. 2f, the O 1s XPS spectra of Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx exhibits three peaks located at 529.8, 531.2 and 533.0 eV, which represent the M-O bond, M-OOH and adsorbed water, respectively [47,48]. The peak of M-O bond in Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx also exhibits a negatively shift by 0.3 eV, indicating that O receives electrons from Fe and Mg doping, leading to the electron enrichment of O atoms, thus increasing the covalence of Fe-O [40]. In general, the Mg-dopant modifies the electronic structure around the O and Fe atoms in Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx [5,49]. Accordingly, the Mg doped FeOOH/NiFeOx would facilitate the quick dissociation of H2O towards fast H2 production [27]. The activity origin of Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx for HER is investigated using in-situ Raman and in-situ ATR-FTIR experiments. Fig. 3 a-b show the in-situ Raman spectra of Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx and FeOOH/NiFeOx, which further reveal the existence of α-FeOOH active species. During HER, the Raman peaks of Fe2O3 in the 400–500 cm-1 region gradually weaken, while the peak intensity of the α-FeOOH signal near 672 cm-1 gradually increases [50–52]. This indicates that some of Fe oxides react with the electrolyte (OH-) and are converted to α-FeOOH active HER species, which further promotes the catalytic activity [5]. Note that, due to the lower Mg-dopant composition (0.4l at%) than Fe (24.4 at%), the signal peak at 672 cm-1 is associated to the OH- in the α-FeOOH rather than OH- in Mg(OH)2. Compared with that on FeOOH/NiFeOx (668 cm-1), the α-FeOOH signal (672 cm-1) on Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx exhibits a blue-shift, indicating that the presence of stronger and shorter Fe-O bond of α-FeOOH in Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx [43,51,53]. Accordingly, it is expected that the strengthened Fe-O bonding in Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx would also benefit its stability performance in HER. Fig. 3c-d illustrates the in-situ ATR-FTIR of Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx and FeOOH/NiFeOx in HER. The peak observed at 1600 cm-1 is attributed to the tensile vibration HOH of water molecules (δH O H) [54,55]. Compared to that of FeOOH/NiFeOx (−0.5 V vs. RHE), the δH O H peak of Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx catalyst appears at a lower HER potential (−0.3 V vs. RHE). Furthermore, with an increase in HER working potential, the peak intensity of HOH on Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx is significantly intensified than that on FeOOH/NiFeOx, indicating the enhanced H2O adsorption by the Mg-dopant. In addition, the wide peak at 2800–3800 cm-1 is associated with the tensile vibration of OH (νO H) [54,56]. As increased negative potential is applied, the intensity of the νO H peak also increases. Moreover, νO H peak in Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx (−0.1 V vs. RHE) appears earlier than in FeOOH/NiFeOx (−0.3 V vs. RHE). This suggests that the Volmer step H2O dissociation on Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx is more favorable than FeOOH/NiFeOx [57]. That is, the Mg dopant promotes the H2O dissociation process, facilitating the Volmer step with enhanced reaction kinetics in alkaline HER. 3.3 Electrochemical performance analysis The LSV curves are measured with a three-electrode system designed to examine the HER activity of Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx. The LSV curves of Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx with varying Mg contents are also studied in 1.0 M KOH. The lowest HER overpotential is found in Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx at a molar ratio of 1:2 for Mg:Ni, as shown in Figure S6. In addition, Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx catalyst exhibits remarkable HER activity over FeOOH/NiFeOx and FF, and even reaching that of Pt/C/FF catalyst (Fig. 4 a). Meanwhile, the Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx catalyst also exhibits a smaller HER overpotential (η) of 18 and 205 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm-2, respectively (Fig. 4b). In evaluating the kinetic behaviour of electrocatalysts, the Tafel slope represents an important parameter [58]. Compared to that of FeOOH/NiFeOx (169 mV dec- 1) and FF (272 mV dec‑1), Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx has a lower Tafel slope of 49 mV dec‑1, suggesting that it exhibits quick HER kinetics (Fig. 4c) [59]. Additionally, the Tafel slope of Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx exhibits a value between 40 and 120 mV dec‑1. It is reported that Tafel slope in this range implies that HER on Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx follows Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism [60,61]. Moreover, the exchange current density (j 0) reflects the capability of the electrode to gain or lose electrons, thus illustrating its activity in catalyzing the electrochemical reactions [62]. The j 0 of Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx obtained by extrapolating the Tafel plot is calculated to be 0.53 mA cm-2, which is almost the same with that of Pt/C/FF (0.54 mA cm-2), see Fig. 4b. The j 0 value of Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx is higher than FF (0.29 mA cm-2) and FeOOH/NiFeOx (0.44 mA cm-2), further supporting the superior charge transfer and HER activity resulted from Mg-dopant introduction. To further investigate the HER kinetics on Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx, in-situ EIS analysis is utilized to measure the charge transfer performance of the catalyst [63]. It is found that Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx has a smaller phase angle than FeOOH/NiFeOx in the low frequency region (0.01–10 Hz) under HER potentials (Figure S7). This indicates that, at the catalyst-electrolyte interface, Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx exhibits a lower electron transfer resistance than FeOOH/NiFeOx, thereby enhancing the kinetics of HER [45]. Figure S8 shows the EIS of Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx, FeOOH/NiFeOx and FF with fitted equivalent circuits at voltages of −0.1 V vs. RHE. Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx has a measured Rct of 0.23 Ω, much lower than that of FeOOH/NiFeOx (2.19 Ω) and FF (20.12 Ω). In addition, the Rct of Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx is also lower than that of FeOOH/NiFeOx at different HER potentials (Fig. 4d). These results further indicate that Mg-dopant leads to a reduction in charge transfer resistance for Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx, resulting in enhanced HER charge transfer kinetics. The Cdl and ECSA show a linear relationship in the non-faradaic potential zone, which determined by CV measurements at various scan speeds (Figure S9 and S10) [64]. Fig. 4e shows that Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx exhibits the highest Cdl of 5.6 mF cm-2 with an ECSA of 140 cm2. This value is higher than of FeOOH/NiFeOx (4.7 mF cm-2 and 117.5 cm2). This demonstrates that the introduction of Mg leads to an exposure of more accessible active surface of Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx. Therefore, to clarify the inherent catalytic activity of these catalysts, their ESCA normalized LSV curves (j ECSA) are presented. The results show that Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx has much higher intrinsic HER activity than FeOOH/NiFeOx and FF, see Fig. 4f. The turnover frequency (TOF) is estimated to obtain insight into their intrinsic activity. The TOF of Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx at an overpotential of 200 mV is determined to be 1.98 s-1, which is 5.8-fold increase in comparison to the TOF of FeOOH/NiFeOx (0.34 s-1), see Fig. 4g. Furthermore, the long-term stability of Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx, FeOOH/NiFeOx and Pt/C/FF is also investigated (Fig. 4h). As can be seen, Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx delivers a high current density of around 100 mA cm-2 at a low voltage of −0.2 V vs. RHE and remains stable after 200 h test. In contrast, FeOOH/NiFeOx requires a higher voltage (−0.36 V vs. RHE) to reach a current density of 100 mA cm-2, and the current density shows a decrease after 70 h. The results show that the stability performance of Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx catalyst is enhanced by the introduction of Mg. In addition, the SEM of Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx also shows no apparent structural change after HER stability test (Figure S11). Overall, the Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx outperforms the control samples in terms of overpotential, Tafel slope, j 0, ECSA, TOF and durability, revealing its excellent HER performance under alkaline media. The overpotential of Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx is also lower than many recently reported transition metal-based HER catalysts, further demonstrating its excellent HER performance (Fig. 4i and Table S2). 3.4 AEM water electrolyzer performance An AEM electrolyzer is constructed using Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx cathode and Ir/C coated FF anode (Fig. 5 a and Figure S12). Fig. 5b displays the performance of Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx catalyst in AEM at 60 °C. The electrolyzer needs a cell voltage of 1.70 V to operate at 500 mA cm-2. This is similar to that utilizing Pt/C/FF || Ir/C/FF electrode (1.68 V). Additionally, the gas products are analyzed and the Faraday efficiency (FE) is calculated (Fig. 5c). The results show that the FE of H2 production is close to 100 %, and almost all electrons are involved in the HER process. Fig. 5d and Table S3 show that the performance and stability of AEMWE with Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx || Ir/C/FF (1.70 V at 500 mA cm-2), which outperforms many reported AEM electrolyzers. More importantly, the electrolyzer shows good long-term stability throughout 500 h of continuous testing conducted at a high current density around 500 mA cm-2 (Fig. 5e). 3.5 DFT analysis Theoretical calculations are performed to study the Mg-dopant effect on the active species catalytic performance, and therefore the α-FeOOH and Mg-(α-FeOOH) models are constructed (Fig. 6 a and Figure S13a-b). The optimized α-FeOOH and Mg-(α-FeOOH) models show that the distance (dFe-O) between the Fe and O atom is 1.92 Å and 1.84 Å, respectively. The dFe-O in Mg-(α-FeOOH) is shortened than that of α-FeOOH, indicating that the bond interaction is strengthened, which might benefits the catalyst stability [65]. Moreover, electron localization function (ELF) is applied to analyze the distribution of electrons on various surfaces, which can be used to describe the bonding type and the probability of spin parallel electrons. Fig. 6b-c shows ELF values of 0.92 and 0.94 in α-FeOOH and Mg-(α-FeOOH), respectively, which are both exceeding 0.5, indicating that the Fe-O bond is covalent. The Mg-(α-FeOOH) also has a high ELF value, indicating that Mg-dopant induces an electron localization effect, which strengthens the covalency of Fe-O bond [66]. This would lead to a stable Mg-(α-FeOOH), consequently improves its stability. Furthermore, the charge density difference analysis is conducted for both α-FeOOH and Mg-(α-FeOOH) model, where the yellow and blue areas representing the electron accumulation and depletion domains, respectively (Fig. 6d and Figure S14). It is evident that there is charge migration between the Fe and O. The addition of Mg-dopant results in the gaining of more electrons on O site, which also strengthens the Fe-O bonding [49]. Moreover, the adsorption capacity of H* on the electrocatalyst surface is interpreted using the d-band center (εd) [6,67]. The calculated εd of α-FeOOH and Mg-(α-FeOOH) is −1.97 and −2.06 eV, respectively (Fig. 6e-f). The downshift of the εd for Mg-(α-FeOOH) in comparison to α-FeOOH indicates weaker H* adsorption on the Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx surface [68]. The Gibbs free energy of H* adsorption, ΔGH*, is utilized to determine the HER catalyst activity from the thermodynamics point of view (Figure S15). To promote the rapid formation of adsorbed H* and enable its prompt release in H2 production, the optimal HER catalyst needs to achieve a near zero Δ G H * [15]. The ΔGH* value for Mg-(α-FeOOH) is calculated to be −0.48 eV, whereas that on α-FeOOH is −0.57 eV (Fig. 6g). The Δ G H * of Mg-(α-FeOOH) is near to the optimal value, indicating that Mg-dopant facilitates the transformation of H* to H2, and accelerates the H2 desorption process. These findings are in line with the experimental results and suggest that the Mg dopant is effective for improving the HER activity. A schematic illustration of HER mechanism is shown in Fig. 6h. The α-FeOOH is considered to be the true active HER species, on which the Volmer-Heyrovsky pathway occurs [69,70]. The Mg dopant promotes the H2O dissociation and weakens the H* adsorption on the α-FeOOH active species with promoted H2 release process, thus benefiting HER kinetics. 4 Conclusion In conclusion, a Mg-doped FeOOH/NiFeOx catalyst is fabricated for efficient and durable alkaline HER. It is found that the Mg-dopant affects the local electronic structure, strengthening the Fe-O bond in the active α-FeOOH species, and at the same time promoting the H2O dissociation in Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx. In addition, the Mg-dopant also modulates the d-band center of α-FeOOH active species, which weakens the H* adsorption with promoted H2 production process, and thus benefits the HER performance. The as-prepared Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx electrocatalyst shows super and robust HER activity, achieving a low HER overpotential of 18 mV at 10 mA cm-2, comparable to the Pt/C catalyst. In addition, the AEM water electrolyzer with Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx electrode shows outstanding stability during 500 h test around 500 mA cm-2. This study offers important insights for the fabrication and mechanistic understanding of high-performance NiFe-based HER catalysts.

        "dc:description": "NiFe-based materials offer tailorable electronic structure and exhibit promising performance in alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Electron-rich earth metals as doping species can regulate the local electronic configuration of NiFe-based catalysts towards improved HER activity. Herein, a low electronegative Mg dopant strategy is utilized to prepare Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx electrocatalyst for HER. The introduction of Mg improves the bonding strength of Fe-O bond in FeOOH active species, resulting in rapid H2O dissociation and improved stability. Meanwhile, Mg-dopant induces a downshift in the d-band center of FeOOH, which weakens the hydrogen adsorption for promoted H2 production. The Mg-FeOOH/NiFeOx catalyst shows an ultra-low HER overpotential of 18 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and excellent stability in 1.0 M KOH. Moreover, the anion-exchange membrane water electrolyzer reaches 500 mA cm-2 at 1.70 V. This study provides a practical strategy to synthesise high-efficiency NiFe-based HER catalysts.",
