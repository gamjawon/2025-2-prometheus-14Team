Phosphorus Ligand Modified Rh/SiO 2 Catalyst for Hydroformylation of Methyl-3-pentenoate LI Xianming 1,3 , DING Yunjie 1,2, *, JIAO Guiping 1,3 , LI Jingwei 1,3 , YAN Li 1 , ZHU Hejun 1 1 Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian 116023, Liaoning, China 2 State Key Laboratory of Catalysis, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian 116023, Liaoning, China 3 Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China Abstract: A phosphorus ligand-modified Rh/SiO 2 catalyst (L-Rh/SiO 2 ) has been developed for hydroformylation of internal olefins to linear aldehydes. This catalyst has high activity and regioselectivity and can be separated easily by filtration after reaction in an autoclave. Moreover, the electronic and steric effects of phosphorus ligands on the catalytic performance of the L-Rh/SiO 2 catalyst have been inves- tigated by using various monodentate and chelating diphosphorus ligands. Key words: hydroformylation; heterogeneous catalyst; internal olefin; electronic effect; steric effect Hydroformylation is an important reaction for the manu- facture of building blocks for the chemical industry [1]. One of the most important goals in current hydroformylation research is the selective conversion of internal olefins to linear alde- hydes [2–4] because these are the more desired species for industrial chemistry. This transformation offers the opportunity to use cheaper internal olefins as feedstock and saves time and energy because it does not need additional purification steps [5]. For example, the hydroformylation of methyl-3-pentenoate (M3P) to 5-formyl-methylpentanoate (5FMP) is part of a re- action pathway to produce caprolactam from butadiene [6,7]. To produce linear aldehydes from internal olefins by hydro- formylation, a suitable catalyst must fulfill two requirements. It must catalyze the fast isomerization between the internal and terminal olefins because the thermodynamic equilibrium mixture contains < 5% terminal olefin. The other requirement is that the hydroformylation of terminal olefins must be faster than that of internal olefins [5]. Homogeneous catalysis is often well defined and can be operated under mild conditions with high efficiency. However, the practical applications of homogeneous catalysts have been limited by complicated and expensive catalyst separation from the products [8]. In contrast, heterogeneous catalysts for hy- droformylation have the advantage of easy separation of cata- lyst from the product, but relatively poor performances were observed [9,10]. A triphenylphosphine (PPh 3 ) modified sup- ported rhodium catalyst has been developed for the hydro- formylation of terminal olefins with high activity and easy separation in our earlier studies [11,12]. In this communication, a phosphorus ligand modified Rh/SiO 2 catalyst (L-Rh/SiO 2 ) is reported for the hydroformy- lation of internal olefins to linear aldehydes. The electronic and steric effects of the ligands on the catalytic performance over L-Rh/SiO 2 catalysts were investigated. The catalyst was prepared according to a procedure reported earlier [12] and the Rh metal loading of the catalyst was 1%. Rh/SiO 2 was introduced into the phosphorus ligand solution in toluene and this mixture was stirred for 2 h. The solvent was removed under vacuum at room temperature and the resulting black L-Rh/SiO 2 (the molar ratio of P:Rh = 10:1) was stored under an argon atmosphere. HRh(CO)[P(OPh) 3 ] 3 (P(OPh) 3 = triphenylphosphite) was prepared according to Ref. [13]. All manipulations were carried out under an argon atmosphere, and all reagents were dehydrated with CaH 2 and degassed with argon. When conducting a hydroformylation reaction in the auto- clave reactor, a mixture of L-Rh/SiO 2 catalyst (0.3 g), toluene (70 ml), and M3P (5.0 ml) was carefully introduced into a 300 ml stainless steel stirred vessel under an argon atmosphere. Then the reactor was purged five times with syngas (CO:H 2 = LI Xianming et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(12): 1193–1195 1:1), the syngas pressure adjusted to 2.0 MPa, and the reactor was heated to 393 K and stirred at 900 r/min for 8 h. The products of hydroformylation were separated from the catalyst by filtration and analyzed by an Agilent 4890D gas chromato- graph with a HP-5 capillary column and FID detector. The results of the hydroformylation of M3P over the het- erogeneous catalyst (Rh/SiO 2 ), homogeneous catalyst HRh(CO)[P(OPh) 3 ] 3 , and P(OPh) 3 -Rh/SiO 2 catalyst are sum- marized in Table 1 (entries 1–3). Besides the main target product of 5FMP, 3-formyl-methylpentanoate (3FMP), 4-formyl-methylpentanoate (4FMP), and methylpentanoate (MP) were also detected in the product. Linear 5FMP can be separated from the mixture by vacuum distillation [14]. The hydrogenation of M3P was dominant over the heterogeneous Rh/SiO 2 catalyst, and the regioselectivity toward 5FMP was very low. In contrast, the homogeneous catalyst showed high activity and regioselectivity. It is worth noting that the P(OPh) 3 -Rh/SiO 2 catalyst showed far higher performance than the Rh/SiO 2 catalyst. Similar performances were observed over the P(OPh) 3 -Rh/SiO 2 catalyst and the homogeneous catalyst. The in situ formation of the homogeneous active species on the PPh 3 -Rh/SiO 2 catalyst was proved in our earlier study [12]. Therefore, this result was probably due to the homogeneous active species formed in situ by the coordination of P(OPh) 3 to the highly dispersed rhodium species on the surface of P(OPh) 3 -Rh/SiO 2 . In order to study the electronic effect of phosphorus ligands on the catalytic performance of the L-Rh/SiO 2 catalyst, a comparison of P(OPh) 3 , PPh 3 and tricyclohexylphosphine (PCy 3 ) was carried out. The catalytic activities over the three ligands are shown in Table 1 (entries 3–5). The basicity of the ligands decreased in the order PCy 3 > PPh 3 > P(OPh) 3 [15]. Clearly, P(OPh) 3 -Rh/SiO 2 showed the highest activity of the three catalysts. This can be attributed to the coordination of the electron-withdrawing ligand that enhanced the electrophilicity of the rhodium center and CO dissociation from (diphospho- rus)Rh(CO) 2 H, which as a consequence facilitated alkene coordination to form a (diphosphorus)Rh(CO)H(alkene) com- plex. In addition, P(OPh) 3 -Rh/SiO 2 showed the highest re- gioselectivity towards 5-FMP. There were two possible reasons to explain this: one would be the promotion of -elimination; the other would be that a less basic phosphorus ligand might facilitate the formation of more crowded complexes, which then would favor linear alkyl intermediates. Chelating diphosphorus ligands often show higher regiose- lectivity to linear aldehydes than monodentate ligands. In particular, chelating diphosphorus ligands with large bite an- gles above 100º have outstanding properties [16,17]. Therefore, chelating diphosphorus ligands were also used in our work to modify the Rh/SiO 2 catalyst, as shown in Scheme 1. The hy- droformylation of M3P over Rh/SiO 2 catalysts modified by chelating ligands are shown in Table 1 (entries 6 and 7). Clearly, the regioselectivities to 5FMV catalyzed by Rh/SiO 2 catalysts with chelating ligands were higher than those catalyzed by Rh/SiO 2 catalysts with monodentate ligands. Unfortunately, lower activities with the chelating ligands were also observed. The different catalytic performances between the chelating Table 1 Comparison of the catalytic hydroformylation of M3P over different catalysts Selectivity (mol%) Entry Catalyst Conversion (%) TOF (h 1 ) MP 3FMP 4FMP 5FMP n/i a 1 Rh/SiO 2 0.7 1.2 54.90 3.6 37.7 3.9 0.09 2 HRh(CO)[P(OPh) 3 ] 3 b 93.7 163.7 10.00 22.9 37.5 29.7 0.49 3 P(OPh) 3 -Rh/SiO 2 85.6 149.5 6.88 23.9 39.7 29.5 0.46 4 PPh 3 -Rh/SiO 2 64.1 112.0 5.10 34.5 44.6 15.8 0.20 5 PCy 3 -Rh/SiO 2 0.5 0.9 35.00 0.0 65.0 0.0 0.00 6 L1-Rh/SiO 2 10.0 17.5 14.50 13.8 36.9 34.8 0.69 7 L2-Rh/SiO 2 12.4 21.7 5.30 14.7 22.6 57.4 1.54 Reaction conditions: p = 2.0 MPa, T = 393 K, t = 8 h, R = 900 r/min, 0.3 g L-Rh/SiO 2 , 70 ml toluene, 5 ml M3P. a n/i = 5FMV/(3FMV + 4FMV) molar ratio; b The content of Rh in the homogeneous catalyst was 0.003 g.

LI Xianming et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(12): 1193–1195 ligands and monodentate ligands can be accounted for that the bulky chelating ligands in the catalyst increased the difficulty in coordinating M3P to the rhodium ion, which then resulted in a decrease in activity. The high n/i ratio can be attributed to that fewer branched alkyls can be coordinated to the rhodium ion than linear alkyls when bulky chelating ligands were present. Furthermore, L2-Rh/SiO 2 showed higher regioselectivity and activity than L1-Rh/SiO 2 . Since the electronic properties at the phosphorus donor in these chelating ligands were almost the same ( 31 P NMR / (L1) = 16.4 and / (L2) = 17.5), the different catalytic performance between L2-Rh/SiO 2 and L1-Rh/SiO 2 would mainly be due to their different steric ef- fects (the bite angle (L1) = 102.2º and (L2) = 111.7º) [16]. The higher regioselectivity of L2-Rh/SiO 2 can be attributed to its larger bite angle, which would be more efficient in inhibit- ing the coordination of branched alkyls to the metal center. Although the bite angle of L2 was larger than that of L1, which meant that the coordination of M3P to the rhodium ion for L2-Rh/SiO 2 would be more difficult than that for L1-Rh/SiO 2 , L2-Rh/SiO 2 was more active than L1-Rh/SiO 2 . This can be ascribed to the formation of the intermediate. In earlier studies [18] on the hydroformylation reaction mechanism, a bis- equatorial coordination of the diphosphorus ligand in a trigo- nal-bipyramidal intermediate was found. The ideal angle for such coordination was 120º. Therefore, L2 would facilitate the formation of the trigonal-bipyramidal intermediate, and this resulted in a higher activity for L2-Rh/SiO 2 . The stability of the P(OPh) 3 -Rh/SiO 2 catalyst was studied over three repeated catalytic runs. The data presented in Table 2 indicated a decrease in catalyst activity after each catalytic cycle. The drop in catalyst activity can be attributed to three possible reasons. Firstly, the deactivation of the catalyst may be caused by oxidation during the operation. Secondly, the deac- tivation may be ascribed to the dissolution of the active species into the solvent. Finally, the deactivation may be caused by high speed stirring which can break the catalyst into small particles that would be leached through the filtration. In conclusion, L-Rh/SiO 2 is a heterogeneous catalyst for the selective hydroformylation of internal olefins to linear products that showed a similar performance to that of the homogeneous catalyst. A phosphorus ligand with a lower basicity enhanced the conversion of olefins and the selectivity to linear aldehydes. Chelating diphosphorus ligands with a large bite angle showed a large effect on the regioselectivity to linear aldehydes. Un- fortunately, the activity of the L-Rh/SiO 2 catalyst was much decreased after several cycles in an autoclave. However, this problem might be solved if hydroformylation was conducted in a fixed bed reactor. References [1] Bohnen H-W, Cornils B. Adv Catal, 2002, 47: 1 [2] Klein H, Jackstell R, Beller M.
