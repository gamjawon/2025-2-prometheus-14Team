IMMOBILIZED RHODIUM-PHOSPHINE HYDROFORMYLATION CATALYSTS MICHAEL E. FORD* and J. E. PREMECZ Chemicals Group, Industrial Chemicals Technology, Air Products and Chemicals, Allentown, PA 18105 (U.S.A.) (Received August 25, 1982) Summary Insoluble analogs of homogeneous rhodium hydroformylation catalysts are obtained by ionic attachment of a functionalized phosphine onto an ion exchange resin, and subsequent ligand exchange with a soluble rhodium complex. Both acidic and basic ion exchange resins can be used for ligand insolubilization. Supported rhodium complexes exhibit superior reactivity for hydroformylation of 1-octene, and low losses of rhodium by metal leaching. Introduction Development and application of efficient insolubilized homogeneous catalysts are focal points of continuing research [1]. Combination of the ready accessibility of active sites and high reactivity under mild conditions of the homogeneous catalyst with the ease of handling and ready separation from the product stream of the heterogeneous catalyst is a major goal of these studies. However, this ideal has yet to be satisfactorily achieved. Most attempts to immobilize homogeneous catalysts without loss of selectivity or reactivity have centered on covalent attachment of a metal complex to an insoluble organic polymer, such as styrene/divinylbenzene copolymer [2], or to an insoluble inorganic support, such as silica [3]. Prompted by a recent report on the immobilization of several Group VIII metal-amine hydro- formylation catalysts on an acidic ion exchange resin [4], we wish to disclose preparation and catalytic evaluation of novel, highly reactive, immobilized rhodium-phosphine hydroformylation catalysts. Specifically, rhodium is readily complexed to acidic or basic phosphine ligands anchored on basic or acidic ion exchange resins, respectively. With these heterogeneous * Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/83/$3.00 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 100 catalysts, 1-octene is hydroformylated to normal and branched aldehyde products (>99% yield) with good selectivity (>2:1 n:b ratio) and no observ- able olefin isomerization. Rates of rhodium leaching from ion exchange resin-supported catalysts are low. Moreover, rates of hydroformylation with the new catalysts are significantly higher than those previously reported for insolubilized rhodium hydroformylation catalysts. Conditions of tempera- ture and pressure required for the high rates are also milder than those previously employed with insolubilized hydroformylation catalysts. Results and discussion Typical procedures for covalent attachment of a homogeneous catalyst to an insoluble support are far from satisfactory [2]. Organic supports must be purified extensively [2, 5]. Syntheses of immobilized complexes are generally protracted, and often require sensitive or relatively inaccessible reagents. Moreover, such syntheses are often difficult to reproduce. Despite their wide utility, ion exchange resins have been virtually ignored as supports for soluble transition metal catalysts [4, 6]. We therefore envisaged a simple, direct route to heterogeneous hydroformylation catalysts of well-defined structure and reactivity. Our route consisted of ionic linkage of a function- alized phosphine ligand to an ion exchange resin, and formation of rhodium- phosphine complexes of the ion exchange resin-bound phosphine ligand. Advantages of this route include simple catalyst preparation, definition and control of a potentially wide range of catalyst structures, and ready availabil- ity of a wide variety of ion exchange resins. Preparation of ion exchange resin-immobilized ligands Both acidic and basic ion exchange resins are readily available with porosities which range from gellular (microreticular) to rigid, large pore (macroreticular) resins. The utility of gellular polymers as catalyst supports for covalently anchored complexes has been amply demonstrated [2]. In contrast, few catalysts have been immobilized on macroreticular resins. However, the dimensional stability and high surface area and porosity of macroreticular resins are significant advantages in fixed bed reactors. Cata- lysts insolubilized on the latter supports should be readily handled, and possess high reactivity. In order to gauge the scope and assess potential limitations of immobilization of hydroformylation catalysts on ion exchange resins, representative examples of both microreticular and macroreticular resins were evaluated as supports. Maximum operating temperatures, the temperatures at which ion exchange resins slowly begin to decompose, are determined by the functionality on the polystyrene backbone. Acidic ion exchange resins typically are stable to 120 -125 C. However, basic ion exchange resins begin to degrade at 60 -100 C. Owing to this difference in 101 TABLE 1 Characteristics of acidic ion exchange resins Resin Porosity Surface Ion exchange Maximum operating (% void) area (meq/g) temperature (m'/g) ( C) Amberlite IR-120 a a 2.2 120 Amberlyst 15 32 45 4.6 120 Amberlyst XN-1005 42 130 3.4 120 Amberlyst XN-1010 47 570 3.3 120 \"Swellable gel. thermal stability, acidic ion exchange resins were primarily investigated as catalyst supports. The acidic ion exchange resins which were investigated for catalyst immobilization were Amberlite IR-120, a representative microreticular sul- fonated styrene/divinylbenzene copolymer, and Amberlyst 15, XN-1005 and XN-1010, representative styrene/divinylbenzene copolymers. Porosity, sur- face area, ion exchange capacity, and maximum operating temperature data for these materials are summarized in Table 1 [7]. All resins were used in the acidic form. Treatment of the resins with either p-(diphenylphosphino)-JV,lV- dimethylaniline, 1, or p-(diphenylphosphino)-N,AT-diethylaniline, 2 [8, 9] 1. R =CH, 2. R=CH,CH3 provided the immobilized ligands. Attachment of the desired aminophos- phine to an acidic ion exchange resin was straightforward, and was carried out by standard column chromatographic techniques at room temperature. Generally moderate to good incorporations of ligand onto the resins were obtained (Table 2). Characterization of ion exchange resin-immobilized aminophosphines Heterogenization of soluble catalysts often introduces ambiguity as to the nature of the active insoluble catalyst species [2, 3]. As one step in the characterization of catalysts which would be formed with ion exchange resin-immobilized phosphines, the mode of attachment of the aminophos- phine to the acidic ion exchange resin had to be determined prior to intro- duction of rhodium. In principle, an aminophosphine such as 1 or 2 could undergo protonation by a sulfonic acid resin at either nitrogen or phospho- rus. Only the unprotonated site would be available for further complexation. A rhodium-amine, a rhodium-phosphine, or a mixture of rhodium-amine and rhodium-phosphine complexes could therefore result.

Comparison of the *H NMR spectrum of the resulting solution with those of free 1 and model compounds in the same medium revealed that 1 undergoes protonation at the dimethylamino group (Table 3). Signals for the protons on the aniline ring of protonated 1 occur in the same chemical shift range as those for the ring protons of N,N,N- trimethylanilinium bromide. Protons on the diphenylphosphino group of protonated 1 are not deshielded, owing to their distance from the dimethyl- ammonium group. In addition, the chemical shift of the methyl signal reflects both protonation of the dimethylamino group and rapid proton exchange between protonated 1 and a small amount of adventitious water in the methanesulfonic acid. As a consequence of rapid proton exchange, the peak observed for the dimethylamino group should be located at the average chemical shift for the free and completely protonated substrate [10]. Based on the model compounds, this average chemical shift should be 3.23 ppm, which is in good agreement with the observed value of 3.22 ppm. Conversely, if 1 were protonated on phosphorus, the resulting positive charge at that site would significantly deshield the protons of both the diphenylphosphino and anilino moieties. Therefore, the chemical shifts of all the aromatic protons would be observed at lower field. Furthermore, protonation at phosphorus would not significantly deshield the methyl groups of 1. The structural and electronic similarity between 1 and 2 indicate that protonation of 2 occurs at the diethylamino group. Comparison of the infrared spectra of sulfonic acid ion exchange resin-immobilized aminophosphines with the known frequencies of (P H) groups and [(aryl^alky^NH]\"*\" groups also indicated that all aminophosphine ligands were bound to the ion exchange resin as the ammonium salt (Table 4). Triarylphosphine moieties of these ligands were therefore available for complexation with rhodium. 103 TABLE 3 NMR characterization of protonated ligand Structure 'H NMR\" a b c d c b b(C^-H(W,\\ 2.85 6.42-6.72 7.10 c b^(0)-^W,), ir 3.61 7.42-7.88 7.30 9 - CH3 Br 7.62-8.08 C<^r\"^-N^.), d c b c<c^^3>-A * CH,SO;OH 2.90 6.65-6.75 7.15-7.25 3.22 7.51-7.55 7.28-7.35 7.30 7.30 \"ppm from tetramethylsilane; 60 MHz.

The initial phosphine/rhodium equivalence ratio was 3:1. After ligand exchange and washing with toluene to remove any soluble rhodium species, the polymeric complexes exhibited orange colors similar to that of the starting rhodium comples. Elemental analysis of the insolubilized complexes indicated that ligand/rhodium ratios of at least 3:1 were obtained (Table 5). Infrared spectra of these complexes showed a single carbonyl stretching frequency at 1960 -1970 cm~1, which is indicative of a trons-chlorodicarbonylrhodium(I) phosphine complex [13].

Hydroformylation with ion exchange resin-supported rhodium-phosphine complexes Catalytic utility of the ion exchange resin-immobilized rhodium- phosphine complexes was evaluated in the hydroformylation of 1-octene (Table 6). At moderate temperatures (80 - 85 C) and pressures (825 - 860 psig), pure (>99.9 wt.%) aldehydes were obtained. Neither isomerization of 1-octene to internal olefins nor reduction of aldehydes to alcohols could be observed. With all catalysts, selectivity to the linear aldehyde isomer was ca. 70 wt.%. Moreover, selectivity to Cq aldehydes, and to linear us. branched aldehydes, was essentially independent of both the identity and properties of the ion exchange resin support and the phosphine ligand. A wide range of catalyst activities was found. Observed initial rates of hydroformylation correlated directly with the structures of the ion exchange resin (vide infra). 106 TABLE 6 Hydroformylation of 1-octene with ion exchange resin-supported rhodium-phosphine complexes' Catalyst Pressure Temperature Rate0 Conversion Selectivity Metal (psig^ ( C) (%) (n/n + b %)'' leaching (ppm/h)6^ I 825 80 0.05 4 67 2.8 II 860 85 0.03 2 67 1.3 III 830 80 4.80 10 70 0.6 IV 825 80 0.80 5 68 0.7 v 825 80 12.64 28 69 1.4 VI 825 80 30.88 64 68 2.0 VII 825 80 32.20 60 68 2.4 ^A\\\\ reactions were carried out in a 128 ml stirred Parr reactor.

No physical deterioration or discoloration of the catalyst beads was observed at the end of each evaluation. Evaluation of a basic ion exchange resin-supported rhodium hydroformylation catalyst The relatively mild conditions under which acidic ion exchange resin- supported rhodium-phosphine hydroformylation catalysts exhibited moderate to high activity suggested that basic ion exchange resin-supported rhodium hydroformylation catalysts should also be viable. Basic ion exchange resins are more thermally labile than their acidic counterparts (vide supra). However, certain basic macroreticular resins (e.g., Amberlyst A21) are stable to 100 C [7]. Therefore, an example of an Amberlyst A21- supported rhodium-phosphine complex was prepared to demonstrate the utility of a basic ion exchange resin-supported hydroformylation catalyst. Reaction of Amberlyst A21 (48% porosity; 25 m^g surface area) [7] with p-(diphenylphosphino)benzoic acid, 3, [8,9] provided the insolubilized p- (diphenylphosphino)benzoate ligand (0.900 mmol/g of resin; 18.7% ligand incorporation). Attachment of the ligand to the ion exchange resin via the 106 carboxylate salt was demonstrated by the infrared spectrum (i/Arco 1550 cm\"1, 1410 cm\"1; I^-H 2700-2750 cm\"1). Treatment of the polymeric ligand with synthesis gas and chlorodicarbonylrhodium(I) dimer [13] pro- vided the anticipated rhodium complex (0.30 meq rhodium/g of resin; ligand/rhodium = 3.0). Hydroformylation of 1-octene with this catalyst was carried out at 80 C and 750 psig of synthesis gas (H^/CO mol ratio is 1.0). Owing to the presence of free dimethylamino groups on the Amberlyst A21 backbone, the yield of product aldehydes might have been decreased as a result of base-catalyzed aldol condensations at the reaction temperature. To evaluate this possible mode of by-product formation, this hydroformylation was carried out to obtain a high conversion (97%) of 1-octene to a 3:1 mixture of linear and branched Cq aldehydes (>99.9 wt.%) No aldol prod- ucts were detected by GLC and 'H NMR analyses of the product. Moreover, products of olefin isomerization or aldehyde reduction could not be detected. The rate of hydroformylation was moderate, 7.8 mol aldehyde/mol rhodium-minute. Little rhodium leaching was found (1.0 ppm/h);elution of the phosphine ligand could not be detected (<0.1 ppm P/h). In addition, neither discoloration nor attrition of the catalyst beads was evident upon completion of hydroformylation. Characteristics of ion exchange resin-supported hydroformylation catalysts Owing to the well-known sensitivity of insolubilized homogeneous catalysts to their environments [14-16], use of ionic catalyst supports might alter the reactivity and/or selectivity of immobilized catalysts relative to the soluble analogs. Identification and definition of the effect of signifi- cant reaction parameters (e.g. temperature, ligand/rhodium ratio, partial pressures of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, and olefin concentration) and of modification of catalyst structure (e.g. immobilization of chelating phos- phines, variation of steric and electronic effects of the functionalized phos- phine ligand resulting from ortho, meta, or para attachment to the ion exchange resin) on the reactivity and selectivity of ion exchange resin- supported hydroformylation catalysts is the subject of continuing study. However, several preliminary comments can be made. For ion exchange resin-supported rhodium hydroformylation catalysts, selectivity to aldehydes, and to linear us. branched aldehydes, shows little dependence on the identity and properties of the ion exchange resin support. Thus, good selectivities (67 - 70% linear Cg aldehydes) are obtained with catalysts immobilized on acidic and basic ion exchange resins. Similarly, the acidic or basic functionality of the phosphine ligand exerts little influence on the selectivity of hydroformylation of 1-octene. Under similar conditions of catalyst loading, temperature and pressure, ion exchange resin-supported rhodium hydroformylation catalysts exhibit superior rates in comparison to insolubilized rhodium hydroformylation catalysts for which rate data have been reported (Table 7). Moderate to high rates of hydroformylation of 1-octene may be obtained with macroreticular ion exchange resin-supported rhodium catalysts.

Observed rates of hydroformylation with macroreticular ion exchange resin-supported catalysts correlate well with the accessibility of catalyst sites, as determined by the porosity and surface area of the resin beads (Table 8). Thus, use of highly porous macroreticular cata- lyst supports leads to increased reaction rates (Table 8, cf. entries 1 - 5). High porosity also partially offsets the tendency of relatively low surface area of the resin matrix to reduce the rate of hydroformylation (Table 7, cf. entries 5, 6), since a relatively large proportion of the catalyst sites are avail- able to the reagents. As anticipated, combination of high resin porosity and surface area, with which catalyst sites are most accessible, provides the highest rate of hydroformylation (Table 7, entries 4, 5). Moderate rates of hydroformylation of 1-octene (0.80 - 4.80 mol aldehyde/mol rhodium-min) are observed for catalysts supported on micro- reticular ion exchange resins. Microreticular ion exchange resins possess a flexible gel structure with no true porosity [7]. For microreticular resin- supported catalysts, swelling of the resin matrix by the organic reaction medium expands the resin structure, and facilitates diffusion of reagents through the resin to the catalyst [7,16 -18]. Thus, reactivity of catalysts supported on microreticular resins is a function of the degree of swelling of the support. In the present instance, swelling of Amberlite IR-120 by toluene/1-octene mixtures accounts for the observed rates of hydrofor- formylation. 109 Experimental Materials and equipment Commercial (Aldrich Chemical Co.) 1-octene was purified by filtration through an alumina column and degassed under vacuum. Model compounds for proton NMR characterization of the protonated ligand were also obtained from Aldrich Chemical Company. Toluene, hexane, and tetra- hydrofuran were heated under reflux for several hours over sodium-benzo- phenone ketil under nitrogen atmosphere and distilled into predried collection vessels under nitrogen atmosphere. Nitrogen, carbon dioxide, argon, and synthesis gas (H^/CO, 1:1 mol ratio) were obtained commercially (>99.9% purity) and used as received. Chlorodicarbonylrhodium(I) dimer was purchased from Alfa Products, refrigerated, and used under argon without further purification. n-Butyllithium (2 M, in hexane) was obtained from Alfa Products, and used as received. Ion exchange resins were donated by Rohm and Haas Co. Melting points were determined with a Thomas Hoover capillary melting point apparatus. Infrared spectra were measured as nujol mulls or KBr discs with a Perkin Elmer Model 281 infrared spectro- photometer. NMR spectra were measured with a Hitachi Perkin Elmer R24B high resolution instrument. GLC separations were done with a Varian Model 3700 gas chromatograph using a methyl silicone 12.5 m capillary column. The Spectra Physics 4000 Chromatography Data System was used for post- run calculations. Elemental analyses were performed by Galbraith Labora- tories, Knoxville, Tennessee. Preparation ofp-(diphenylphosphino)-N,N-dimethylanUine, 1 A solution of p-bromo-A^-dimethylaniline (12.0 g, 0.06 mol) in tetrahydrofuran (40 ml) was slowly added dropwise to cooled ( 78 C) n- butyllithium (0.06 mol; 30.0 ml of 2 M solution in hexane) under nitrogen atmosphere. After addition of the solution of p-bromo-A?,Jv-dimethylaniline was complete, a thick, creamy precipitate formed. Chlorodiphenylphosphine (10.8 ml; 0.06 mol) was then added dropwise from a syringe, and the reac- tion was allowed to warm to room temperature overnight. Isolation of the product was accomplished by partition of the reaction mixture between chloroform (100 ml) and saturated aqueous sodium chloride (100 ml). Separation of the organic phase, extraction of the aqueous phase with chlo- roform (50 ml), combination of the organic phases, dessication (magnesium sulfate), filtration, and evaporation provided the crude ligand. Crystallization from ethanol/chloroform (1:1 v/v) provided 11.5 g (63%) purep-(diphenyl- phosphino)-M^-dimethylaniline, m.p. 150 -151 C, IR (nujol mull) 3020, 2800, 1626, 1601, 1584, 1518, 1496,1452; 'H NMR (CDCIa) 6 2.7 (6H, s), 6.23 - 6.58 (2H, d), 6.72 - 7.23 (12H, m). Elemental analysis: calculated; C, 78.67, H, 6.60, N, 4.95. Found: C, 78.59, H. 6.65, N, 4.71. Preparation ofp-(diphenylphosphino)-N,N-diethylaniline, 2 A solution of p-bromoW.AT-diethylaniline (13.68 g, 0.06 mol) in tetra- hydrofuran (40 ml) was treated according to the method of the preceding 110 example. Crystallization of the crude ligand from ethanol/chlorofonn (1:1 v/v) provided 12.8 g (64%) pure p-(diphenylphosphino)-N,N-diethylaniline, m.p. 151 -153 C, IR (nujol mull) 3040, 2960, 1628, 1598, 1582, 1498, 1456; 'H NMR (CDCIa) 5 0.87 -1.09 (6H, t), 2.25 - 2.59 (4H, q), 6.22 - 6.59 (2H, d), 6.74 - 7.25 (12H, m). Elemental analysis: calculated; C, 79.25, H, 7.26, N, 4.20. Found: C, 79.07, H, 6.98, N, 4.42. Preparation of p-(diphenylphosphino)benzoic acid, 3 p-(Diphenylphosphino)benzoic acid was prepared from p-dibromo- benzene (7.07 g, 0.03 mol) according to the procedure of Baldwin and Cheng [8,9]. Crystallization from ethanol provided 6.88 g (75%) pure p- (diphenylphosphino)benzoic acid, m.p. 154 -156 C (lit. m.p. 156 -158 C) [9]. Elemental analysis: calculated; C, 74.50, H, 4.84. Found: C, 74.30; H, 5.05. General procedure for preparation of ion exchange resin-immobilized phosphine ligands The appropriate ion exchange resin (5 g) was treated with methanol to remove entrained water [21]. A solution of the appropriate phosphine ligand (60% of the total ion exchange capacity) in methanol/chloroform was slowly chromatographed over the ion exchange resin four times. Pure methanol (100 ml) was then slowly chromatographed over the resin to remove any free ligand, and the supported phosphine ligand was washed with methanol and chloroform (1:1 mixture, 50 ml) and dried in vacuo. Analytical data for the resulting ion exchange resin-supported phosphine ligands are summarized in Table 2. General procedure for preparation of ion exchange resin-supported rhodium hydro'formylation catalysts Ligands supported on acidic or basic ion exchange resins were treated with chlorodicarbonylrhodium(I) dimer (16 mol% of the level of supported ligand; see Table 2) in toluene solution (20 ml) under synthesis gas (1:1 H2/CO; 800 psig) at 92 C for 8 -12 h [12] in a stirred 128 ml Parr reactor to provide supported rhodium hydroformylation catalysts. Analytical data for the resulting ion exchange resin-supported rhodium complexes are summarized in Table 5. Isolation and evaluation of the catalyst activity of these complexes are described in the next section. General procedure for evaluation of ion exchange resin-supported hydro- formylation catalysts Catalyst evaluation was carried out in a 128 ml stirred Parr reactor. The reactor containing the crude supported rhodium hydroformylation catalyst was placed in a glove box under an argon atmosphere, vented, and opened. The supported catalyst was removed from the reactor and washed with toluene (4 X 25 ml). Catalysts were evaluated by addition of a solution of 1- octene in toluene (for concentrations, see Table 7) to the dry supported Ill catalyst in a clean Parr reactor, the reactor was closed, pressurized to 800 - 850 psig with synthesis gas (1:1 H^/CO), and heated. To assess overall conversion and metal leaching, reactions with acidic ion exchange resin- supported catalysts were carried out for 15 h, and analyzed as indicated in Tables 6 and 7. Potential by-product formation by aldol condensation of the aldehyde products, which might be catalyzed at elevated temperatures by the free dimethylamino groups of the Amberlyst A21-supported catalyst, was evaluated by carrying out this specific hydroformylation for 36 h to obtain a high overall conversion. Additional experimental details are in Tables 6 and 7. References 1 D. D. Whitehurst, Chemtech., (1980) 44; N. K. Mathur, C. K. Narangi and R. E.
