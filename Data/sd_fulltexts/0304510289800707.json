BROWN and CRAIG FAIRBRIDGE Energy Research Laboratories, CANMET, Energy, Mines and Resources Canada, 555 Booth Street, Ottawa, Ont. KlA OG1 (Canada) (Received August 10, 1988; accepted December 20,1988) Summary The supported molybdenum clusters previously described [1] were tested for their potential activity in the catalysis of cumene hydrocracking, thiophene hydrogenolysis, propene hydrogenation and, in some instances, gas oil hydrocracking. The effect of modifying the alumina support by the addition of fluoride ion was also investigated for those materials which showed promising catalytic activity, and the molybdenum loading was varied over the calculated range 4 -10%. The effect of cobalt and nickel promoters was then examined. The results were compared with those obtained from conventional catalysts, prepared by impregnation of 7- alumina with molybdate with and without fluoride, cobalt and nickel additives. The most active catalysts tested were those prepared from the hexa- nuclear cluster, (H30+)2[Mo6Cll4]2- 6H20. These catalysts gave surprisingly high conversions in cumene hydrocracking, and had substantial activity in HDS studies. As hydrocracking catalysts for application to commercial feedstocks they showed considerable promise, especially when the Mo loading factor was taken into account. XPS studies of one of this series of catalysts suggested that in the hydrocracking of cumene and in the hydrodesulfurization of thiophene, the integrity of the cluster is destroyed during use, and hence the clusters should be regarded as precursors of the active catalytic species rather than being the active species themselves. * Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-6102/89/$3.60 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 382 Introduction The current interest in the catalytic properties of supported metal clusters and the preparation of a series of six molybdenum clusters which were deposited onto 7-alumina supports were discussed previously [1]. Spectroscopic studies showed that after drying the materials at 60 C the clusters remained intact. Their ranges of thermal stability were limited, however, and it was anticipated that this would render the supported clusters more likely to serve as catalyst precursors than as catalysts in their unchanged state. A possible exception would be in the catalysis of alkene hydrogenation and alkene metathesis, which have been shown to occur over supported dimolybdenum clusters at relatively mild temperatures [2]. In this paper the catalytic properties of six supported clusters, com- prising four trinuclear, one tetranuclear and one hexanuclear species, are evaluated. The test reactions employed were cumene hydrocracking, thiophene hydrodesulfurization and propene hydrogenation. The relatively successful results obtained with the hexanuclear cluster prompted us to extend the investigation of this catalyst to include studying the effects of molybdenum loading and of the addition of fluoride ion, cobalt(II), fluoride + cobalt(II), and also nickel(II). These results could then be compared with those obtained on the related catalytic materials obtained in the more conventional way, namely by using molybdate ion as the source of molybdenum. Significant increases in activity were obtained using the cluster precursor, based on comparable loadings of Mo. Experimental Catalyst preparation The new catalysts involving supported clusters were prepared as previously described [1]. The procedure vyas modified to allow the incor- poration of fluoride, cobalt or nickel. The addition of these ions was usually accomplished by impregnation of the previously prepared Cat-6 with the appropriate solution, namely ammonium fluoride, cobalt nitrate or nickel nitrate respectively. The material was then dried at 60 C as previously described [1] and pretreated as needed before use. An alternative method of introducing the fluoride was to incorporate it into the alumina before the addition of the cluster. The method employed in our laboratory is described in [3]. This procedure was used to prepare Cat-62, which was then impregnated with cobalt nitrate solution to make Cat-63. Reference catalysts MB 480, 481 and 500 were prepared as described in [4]. Catalyst testing (a) Cumene hydrocracking was carried out in a continuous-flow, fixed- bed reactor made of stainless steel, with an inner diameter of 15 mm. The 383 catalyst (equivalent to 0.15 g of M003/7-A403, 120 - 200 mesh) was supported between two quartz wool plugs. It was reduced by heating to 500 C in a stream of hydrogen (300 ml min\"1) for 1.5 h. The cumene was held at a temperature of 20 C in a presaturator and passed into the reactor in the hydrogen stream (0.6 mol%). The reactor was held at a temperature of 400 C ( 1), and the products were passed directly into a GC at 100 C equipped with a 2 m X 0.32 cm o.d. packed column containing 5% diisodecylphthalate +5% bentonite 34 on 60 - 80 mesh Chromosorb W. The reaction was continued until the products were at a constant concentration and maintained in this condition for 1 h before the data were used (see Discussion). Typically the reaction proceeded for 4 h in total. Data were processed to obtain the conversions listed in the Tables by the methods we have previously reported [3]. (b) Thiophene hydrodesulfurization was carried out by a similar procedure using the same flow reactor as above. The same size catalyst sample was used, but in this case it was presulfided before use by heating to 500 C in a stream of 10% HyS in H; for 1.5 h. Excess H^S was flushed from the reactor with hydrogen before admitting the thiophene (6 mol%) into the gas stream. The latter was maintained at a temperature of 14 C in a saturator and passed into the reactor (held at 400 C) in a stream of hydrogen gas whose flow rate was 30 ml min~1. The products were analysed using a Hewlett Packard Model 5890 GC equipped with a 10 ml X 530 /xm diameter column containing Carbowax 20 M, at 60 C. (c) Propene hydrogenation was carried out in an analogous way, with the following parameters: the propene source was a cylinder held at ambient temperature; it was mixed with hydrogen in a ratio of 4:26 (13 mol%) at a total gas flow rate of 30 ml min~1. Analysis was on a Porasil B column at 60 C, with a 80 -100 mesh size. (d) Hydrotreatment of Syncrude Coker Gas Oil was accomplished in a bench-top, stirred batch reactor constructed out of Hastalloy-C. The catalyst (1 g) was placed in the reactor with 2 ml of CS^, and after sealing and pressure testing with argon at 34.5 bars, it was filled with hydrogen to 69 bars and heated to 450 C for 3 h to sulfide the catalyst. The reactor was then flushed with argon at 34.5 bars several times when the catalyst was conditioned in an atmosphere of hydrogen at 69 bars and 450 C for 3 h. To introduce the Gas Oil (25 g) it was necessary to open the reactor, after suitably cooling and flushing with argon. The reactor was then resealed, pressure tested with argon as before, then charged with hydrogen at 69 bars and heated to 410 C for 3 h. Rapid cooling could be effected with an internal water cooling system to terminate the reaction. Products were analysed as follows: densities were determined using a Paar digital density meter, model DMA 40; viscosity was measured on a Brookfield digital viscometer, model EX-100; C, H analyses carried out by Guelph Chemical Laboratories, Guelph, Ont., Canada; sulfur was determined in the laboratories of Alberta Sulphur Research Ltd., using a Princeton Gamma Tech X-ray fluorescence sulfur analyser, Model 100. 384 Other analyses on used catalysts and products were carried out either in the Department of Chemistry, University of Calgary Analytical and Spectroscopic Services Laboratory, or by Guelph Chemical Laboratories (as above). The X-ray photoelectron Spectroscopic study of the Cat-6 series of catalysts was performed using a Perkin-Elmer Physical Electronics 548 photoelectron spectrometer employing Mg Ka X-ray radiation (1253.6 eV) operating at 150 watts. The basic design of the instrument has been described previously [5]. Uncoated samples could be analysed in the vacuum chamber without the pressure exceeding s 2 X 10~8 torr (2.7 X 10~6 Pa). Gold (Au 4f7/2 = 83.8 eV) was used for instrument calibration purposes and the binding energies were referenced to the hydrocarbon (C Is = 284.6 eV) line. A charge-neutralizing system (electron flood gun) was used to monitor, and when required, to minimize specimen charging. Specimen surfaces were not polished or treated in any other manner; the samples were dusted onto double-sided sticky tape prior to XPS analysis. The surface composition of each sample was determined semi- quantitatively using XPS peak intensities and elemental sensitivity factors, as previously described [6]. Surface area measurements on representative samples were carried out by the BET method using commercial equipment (Micromeritics Model 2200). Results Catalyst description The description of all the catalysts used in this study is given in Table 1. The percentages of each additive given are those calculated on the assumption that complete uptake of the adsorbant occurred during the impregnation process, and that the amount of water on the alumina surface was not altered by the impregnation/drying procedure. In fact, analytical testing of the supported clusters suggested that some loss of impregnant had occurred [1]. The procedure used was identical for all catalysts and it is not clear where any loss of additives could have occurred, thereby suggesting the possibility of the deviation arising from the analytical testing procedure rather than the preparation methods. Evaluation of catalytic activity Of the wide range of possible reactions which could be used to probe catalytic activity, those selected were chosen for their relevance to existing literature and for their relevance to the possible application of the supported clusters to the hydrocracking of heavy oils, gas oils and possibly of bitumen. The first of these reactions was the hydrocracking of cumene which, as previously discussed [3], is a sensitive probe for the ability of a catalyst to crack and hydrogenate hydrocarbon molecules.

The ability of molybdenum catalysts to mediate this reaction has been the focus of innumerable studies, and is very pertinent to the possible application of the catalysts to hydrocracking of heavy, sour, industrial feedstocks. We also investigated the application of selected species in the catalytic hydrogenation of propene. This followed the work of Iwasawa et al. [2] who showed that catalysts based on allyl molybdenum complexes anchored to alumina were very active in some cases. Lastly, the most promising catalytic materials were tested in the hydrocracking of a heavy gas oil to provide an estimate of the likelihood of their being applicable to real industrial situations. The model compound testing results are presented in Tables 2 and 3. Table 2 shows hydrocracking of cumene as catalysed by the various supported clusters, promoted supported clusters and reference catalysts. (See Table 1 for complete catalyst descriptions; for convenience the additives and their loading factors are given with the results in Tables 2 and 3.) As previously discussed [3], cracking to benzene is heavily dependent on the presence of Bronsted acid sites. The activity of 7-alumina itself in this respect is very small, but the addition of fluoride develops Bronsted sites which greatly enhance the activity towards cracking to benzene. It has been suggested [3] that the subsequent addition of a hydrogenation component to the catalyst allows a second mechanism for cumene cracking to be introduced. This involves the initial dehydrogenation of the side-chain, followed by protonation and cracking of the side-chain. For weakly acidic catalysts, and in the absence of hydrogen, the dehydrogenation reaction to give a-methylstyrene may be the dominant reaction: C6Hs-CH(CH3)2 > CeHsC(CH3)=CH2 + H^ Even in the presence of external hydrogen there is often a small amount of a-methylstyrene produced. This is exactly what we observe for Cat-1, -2, and -5. There is essentially no cracking activity exhibited by these species. Cat-3, however, yielded 8.5% benzene in addition to the a-methylstyrene and apparently possesses some Bronsted acidity. There is little doubt that in this case the presence of NH4F, cocrystallized with the cluster, and possibly also of fluoride in the cluster itself, is the cause of the surface acidity of this supported cluster. This is not the case for the Cat-6 series, however, which all show an ability to crack cumene to benzene. Indeed the results for the cobalt-promoted series, Cat-61, -64 and -65, which parallel those for the nickel-promoted series (-66, -67 and -68), show substantial hydrocracking activity which increases with molybdenum loading. This is clearly a function of the cluster additive, however, since Cat-Rl and Cat-R3, which were impregnated with ammonium molybdate rather than with the Mog cluster, showed virtually no ability to crack cumene to benzene. This is a very interesting result since it is the only case, of the many we have studied [3, 8], in which substantial hydrocracking of cumene to benzene over a support of this type is catalyzed by a species containing no fluoride additive.

Firstly, XPS studies of a used catalyst show that there is very little detectable chloride left in the active catalytic phase. A second piece of evidence was obtained when the Cat-6 series of catalysts was prepared using aqueous HC1 as the impregnation solvent. The materials so produced had dramatically reduced catalytic activity, rather than the increase which might be expected if Cl~ were the active additive to alumina. Thirdly, previous studies of Ni Mo modified by different ions [7] showed that for cyclohexane isomerization, a reaction dependent on the Bronsted acidity of the catalyst, chloride produced no enhancement of the activity. Furthermore, the addition of fluoride (Cat-62 and -63) causes a large increase in hydrocracking activity, which is substantially greater than that observed for the fluorided molybdate-based catalysts Cat-R4 and -R5 (Table 2). Comparison with data obtained previously [3] in our laboratories (under identical reaction con- ditions) also substantiates the claim that the cluster-based catalysts are more active than molybdate-based catalysts. Duplicate preparations and testing of the cluster-based catalysts by different workers in our group yielded remarkably consistent results. 389 The inference from these observations is that the Mog is a better precursor for an active catalyst for cracking to benzene. It appears to be promoted by fluoride, or at least to function synergistically with fluoride on the alumina surface. Our previous work showed [3] that for reduced Co Mo/Al203 catalysts the presence of fluoride and molybdenum together gave a much higher activity than the sum of the activities of the two com- ponents, i.e. F~/Co Mo/Al203 > (F~/Al203+ Co Mo/Al203). In comparison with any other catalyst of this type that we have tested, the activity levels of Cat-62 and Cat-63 are the highest we have encountered. The products associated with side-chain cracking are styrene and ethylbenzene, and possibly toluene although none was observed here. None of the cluster-based catalysts gave evidence of effecting significant side- chain cracking. This could be the result of low activity in the hydrogenation/ dehydrogenation component of the required reaction (see above discussion), and hence we decided to study their hydrogenation qualities directly in testing with the propene/hydrogen system. Hydrogenation of propene The testing was restricted to Cats 1-6, and some representative derivatives of Cat-6 and two reference catalysts. Based on the high activities observed by Iwasawa et al. [2], we began by studying the reactions at ambient temperature and with no high temperature activation of the catalyst in a hydrogen stream. We observed zero activity for every case studied, and hence moved to progressively higher temperatures for both the activation and reaction steps. Ultimately we found it possible to get measurable hydro- genation activities only by activating at 500 C and operating at 400 C, which conditions apply to the data in Table 3. One exception to this was Cat-61, which after activation at 500 C, gave an initial conversion of propene to propane of 86% at 250 C, but this dropped rapidly to a steady state value of only 12%. By raising the operating temperature to 400 C the comparable conversion values are 45 and 25% respectively, as presented in Table 3. Because of this unexpected deactivation we present comparable data for all the catalysts tested. It is noteworthy that the reference catalysts Cat-Rl and -R2 showed no diminution of activity while on stream. Suspecting that this deactivation may have been due to deposition of carbon on the catalysts, we carried out elemental analyses on Cat-6 and Cat-61 after use under various conditions, as presented in Table 4. The absolute values of these percentages may be less significant than the comparison between the carbon content of spent Cat-61, (after use at 250 and 400 C). In the case of the 250 C reaction, rapid deactivation occurred as described above, and in this case the carbon content was greater by a factor of three than that of the catalyst operated at 400 C. There is one difference in the alkene hydrogenation studies from all the other test reactions and that is that Cat-6 is less reactive than Cat-1. The acetate and aqua ligands in this trinuclear cluster might have been predicted to be the most labile, thus creating sites for catalytic activity. This catalyst 390 TABLE 4 Results of elemental analyses of Cat-6 and Cat-61 after use under various conditions Catalyst Activation temperature ( C) Reaction C H temperature (%) (%) ( C) Cat-6 200 23 0.17 0.62 500 400 0.20 0.24 Cat-61 500 250 0.36 0.43 500 400 0.13 0.35 showed no tendency to deactivation over the period studied. Nevertheless the supported clusters studied here are all clearly much less active in alkene hydrogenation than the allyl molybdenum catalysts described by Iwasawa et al. [2]. This may well be due to the ligands present in the clusters 1-6, which would in most cases be considered less labile than the allyl group. Thus the activation conditions needed to produce vacant sites on the cluster would need to be more severe. In fact, some of the ligands may well fragment when exposed to the 400 C activation temperature, leaving oxide, sulfide or nitride ions in their place, and precluding the production of vacant sites. This could be the cause of the failure of these materials to function as low temperature hydrogenation catalysts. We also note that no metathesis products were observed in the GC traces of the propene hydrogenation reactions, propane and unreacted propene being the only observable species. Such reactions would certainly require access to a coordinatively unsaturated metal center. Hydrodesulfurization of thiophene The catalysts were presulfided prior to the HDS testing, which was carried out at 400 C as described in the Experimental Section. The results are expressed as conversion of thiophene and given in Table 3. The pattern of activity is similar to that shown for cumene conversion, namely the series of catalysts derived from the Mog cluster, Cat-6 and Cat-61 through -68, display the highest activity levels. These are very dependent on the Mo loading, and the presence of cobalt promotes the activity. Nickel promotion appears to be equally as effective. The addition of fluoride to conventional Co Mo/AIzO^ catalysts was found to lower HDS activity, particularly at high fluoride loadings [8], but in comparing the result for Cat-6 with Cat-62 fluoride has a positive effect on HDS activity. However, the more normal trend is noted in the cobalt-promoted catalysts Cat-61 and -63, wherein a small depressing influence is caused by fluoride. Catalysts derived from the Mo3 and Mo4 clusters gave generally very low activities in HDS studies and were only marginally above the background level produced by the alumina support (3.0% under the same experimental 391 conditions [8]). The effect of promoters on these species was not examined in this study. Evaluation of selected catalysts in the hydrocracking of a gas oil The high activity of the Cat-6 series in model compound reactions suggested that they should be evaluated in an industrially more significant context, hence we decided to compare the activity of three typical examples (Cat-6, -61 and -63) with conventional Co Mo^-AlaOa catalysts (MB 480, 481 and 500) previously studied in our laboratories. These catalysts had themselves been tested in the hydrocracking of a heavy gas oil derived from Athbasca bitumen (see Experimental). The results are given in Table 5. The conditions for this testing are given in the Experimental Section. The most striking aspect of the results is the fact that even though the molybdenum loading for Cat-6, Cat-61 and Cat-63 is only half that used in the conventionally prepared catalysts, they are almost as effective as hydro- cracking catalysts for gas oil, based on the product quality. Available data [9] on commercial hydrotreating and hydrocracking catalysts suggest that the average loading of molybdenum would be in the range 6-10% by weight, so that the Cat-6 series reported here (4.4%) would be well below the conventional loading level. The possibility exists, therefore, that cluster precursors could reduce the consumption of molybdenum significantly in cases where short catalyst lifetimes require that the catalyst in a reactor is replenished continuously, and may not be recovered in 100% yield. The other intringuing aspect of the results is the unexpectedly low aromaticity of the liquid product from the reaction over Cat-63. This hydrocracking experiment was therefore repeated, and the product analysed for all the properties described in the Table. The results were totally TABLE 5 Catalyst evaluation in the hydrocracking of a bitumen-derived coker gas oil Catalyst untreated Cor pa npositic Ccft in Mo\" Density of liquid prodi0.9729 Viscosity ict (mPa s at 2E77.5 S >5 K) (%)3.87 Aromaticity0 0.300 blank run** 0.9547 11.6 3.26 0.338 MB 480d 0 2.37 10.0 0.9013 5.2 0.34 0.314 MB 481<1 1 2.37 10.0 0.8677 3.1 0.08 0.204 MB 500'1 2 2.37 10.0 0.8745 2.7 0.11 0.336 Cat-6 0 0 4.38 0.8972 6.7 0.75 0.338 Cat-61 0 1.1 4.38 0.8848 6.1 0.25 0.238 Cat-63 1 1.1 4.38 0.8974 6.6 0.23 0.18 \"Number of F atoms per 10 Al atoms.

Clearly it will be desirable to pursue this study in more depth since reduction of aromaticity in hydrocracking of bitumen-derived feedstocks is a crucial aspect of the upgrading process. Discussion The results presented have explored the potential of molybdenum clusters of nuclearity 3, 4 and 6 to be used in the preparation of Mo/7-Al203 catalysts. Thermal stability studies of the supported and unsupported clusters [1] showed that decomposition occurs below the likely operating temperatures for catalysts in most hydrogenation usages. Testing at lower temperatures for alkene hydrogenation, shown by Iwasawa et al. [2] to be feasible for catalytic materials based on silica and alumina supported allyl molybdenum complexes, was unsuccessful for all of our materials under the conditions of pretreatment used. Of the six clusters studied, the hexanuclear species (HsO^tMoeCl^] 6H20 gave the most positive results in most of the model compound tests and also in the hydrocracking of gas oil. The critical question is whether the cluster is degraded, e.g. to MoC>3 or MoS;, during the pretreatment or reaction period of the test. To explore this problem we have examined the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the cluster itself, i.e. (HaC^tMoeCl^]- GH^O, the cobalt-promoted cluster anchored to 7-alumina, i.e. Cat-61, the same material after being on stream in the HDS of thiophene for 3 h, and Cat-65 after use in cumene hydrocracking. The most useful part of these spectra is the Mo 3d binding energy region (Fig. 1). The XPS of the cluster itself, and a number of related species, have been reported by Hamer and Walton [10]. In Fig. 1 the spectra of (W^IMo^^], fresh Cat-61, Cat-65 after use in cumene hydrocracking and Cat-61 after use in hydrodesulfuriza- tion of thiophene are shown. The Mo 3d and Cl 2p regions of the spectrum contain the most valuable information, and hence have been selected for display here. For the unsupported cluster, the Mo Sd^/^ and Sds/i energies occur at 232.6 and 229.5 eV respectively. Anchoring to the 7-alumina (Cat-6) causes a change in this region of the spectrum. There is evidence of substantial oxidation of the molybdenum to Mo(VI) on the alumina surface, which was not apparent from the UV-visible spectral study. Although it is not inconceivable that this reaction is induced by the exposure to high vacuum, the X-ray source and/or the flood gun, the experimental conditions were set to minimize any sample degradation (only 150 watts of X-ray power). A series of tests on the unsupported and supported Mog clusters indicated no decomposition at these operating conditions. Curve fitting of the molybdenum 3d region of the XPS spectrum of Cat-6 reveals two doublets (235.6, 232.5 eV) and (232.6 and 229.5 eV) which would be compatible with the presence of Mo(VI) and the original Mo6Cli4 cluster respectively.

X-ray photoelectron spectra for cluster 6 (Al, Bl), Cat-61 (fresh) (A2, B2), Cat-61 (after use in HDS) (A3, B3), and Cat-65 (after use in cumene hydrocracking) (A4, B4). A series are Mo 3d; B series are Cl 2p spectra. peak binding energies, however, it appears that some change of ligation of the cluster may have occurred. For the cluster itself, the Cl 2p binding energies are divided into their characteristic pair of peaks corresponding to terminal Cl (ca. 198 eV) and bridging Cl (ca. 200.5 eV) atoms respectively, with an intensity ratio of (b/t) ca. 2.0. After anchoring, the intensity ratio of these two peaks is unexpectedly reversed (b/t = 0.5), with the stronger one now being at lower energy, i.e. terminally bound. This could be caused by the substitution of some of the facial, triply bridging chlorides by oxide (or hydroxide ions) from the support. After the HDS reaction there is no signal due to the original cluster, and the spectrum can be explained as being produced mainly by MoS; and 394 M003. The Cl 2p signal is much depleted in the spectrum of the used catalyst, and too noisy to interpret. The two smallest peaks in the Mo 3d spectrum (Fig. 1 A3) are due to the presence of sulfur species on the catalyst surface. The S 2s signal at lowest binding energy (225.6 eV) is compatible with sulfide (MoS;), while the other (231.7 eV) is likely due to the presence of sulfate. This probably arose from the oxidation of MoSz crystallites on the surface during post-reaction air exposure. The S 2p signal (not shown) supports these assignments, which are based on previous work [6]. A similar conclusion was reached for Cat-65 (Fig. 1 A4, B4), which was examined after use in hydrocracking of cumene. The XPS data suggest that virtually no cluster remained, since there is no significant Cl 2p signal and the fitted molybdenum 3d envelope suggests the presence of Mo(VI) and Mo(IV), indicative of MoOa (235.6, 232.5 eV) and MoO; (232.5, 229.5 eV). XPS determined surface elemental compositions (wt.%) for the four systems discussed above are as follows: Cluster 6: Mo, 51.6; Cl, 32.80; 0, 4.4; C, 11.3% Cat-61: Mo, 2.9; Al, 42.7; Cl, 3.6; 0, 42.5; C, 8.3% Cat-61 (after HDS use): Mo, 3.6; Cl, 1.7; Al, 38.3; C, 16.3; 0, 38.1; S, 20% Cat-65 (after hydrocracking use): Mo, 3.9; Cl, 0.6; Al, 29.3; C, 28.2; 0, 35.4% These data, of course, reflect the approximate composition of the uppermost few surface layers of the solid, rather than the bulk composition. The spent catalysts also exhibited extensive hydrocarbon coverage on the surface, and hence comparisons between the samples must take into account this overlayer attenuation influence, especially when considering the electrons of lower kinetic energy. The relative lack of success using the other five clusters in this study could be due to their different nuclearity, but more likely it is a function of the other ligands present. These include cyanide, diethyldithiocarbamate, oxalate, acetate and fluoride. It is noteworthy that the fluoro complex was the second most active species in the model compound testing, which might be expected on the basis of the known propensity of fluoride to promote reactions on alumina surfaces. This might reflect some degree of degradation of the cluster to release fluoride to the support, but since the cluster as used contained some NH4F of crystallization, this represents an additional possible source of fluoride. Conclusions These studies confirm the earlier hypothesis, namely that the clusters do not survive intact under the conditions of temperature, H; and/or HyS 395 atmosphere found in the test reactors. Thus the clusters should be regarded as catalyst precursors rather than as the actual catalyst in these specific reactions. It is interesting to speculate on the possible connection between the surface species generated by the use of the Moe precursors as compared to molybdate. A detailed discussion of possible models was presented by Weigold [11]. He concluded that the terminal groups in chains of Mo atoms were likely to be most catalytically active under reducing conditions, and invoked the concept of metal-metal bonding as a necessary consequence of reduction. It would seem likely that the retention of metal-metal bonding in surface species derived from the Mo^ clusters could be associated with their successful use as catalyst precursors in this work. However this remains speculative at this point, as we seek other methods to more fully characterise these systems. References 1 P. M. Boonnan, C. Fairbridge, K. S. Jasim and R. A. Kydd, J. Mol.

K1A 0G1 Canada The supported molybdenum clusters previously described [1] were tested for their potential activity in the catalysis of cumene hydrocracking, thiophene hydrogenolysis, propene hydrogenation and, in some instances, gas oil hydrocracking. The effect of modifying the alumina support by the addition of fluoride ion was also investigated for those materials which showed promising catalytic activity, and the molybdenum loading was varied over the calculated range 4 – 10%. The effect of cobalt and nickel promoters was then examined. The results were compared with those obtained from conventional catalysts, prepared by impregnation of γ-alumina with molybdate with and without fluoride, cobalt and nickel additives. The most active catalysts tested were those prepared from the hexanuclear cluster, (H3O+)2[Mo6Cl14]2−·6H2O. These catalysts gave surprisingly high conversions in cumene hydrocracking, and had substantial activity in HDS studies. As hydrocracking catalysts for application to commercial feedstocks they showed considerable promise, especially when the Mo loading factor was taken into account. XPS studies of one of this series of catalysts suggested that in the hydrocracking of cumene and in the hydrodesulfurization of thiophene, the integrity of the cluster is destroyed during use, and hence the clusters should be regarded as precursors of the active catalytic species rather than being the active species themselves.
