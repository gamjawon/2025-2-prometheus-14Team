It is shown that, in the gas phase, hydrogenation of reactants with boiling points near the reaction temperature is possible. In the liquid phase, catalyst activity varies from 1.15 to 60 min-' and in the gas-phase reaction from 3 to 8.16 min-'. In the liquid-phase hydroformylation of ? -hegene with RhHCO(Pc53 )3 , the catalyst activity at 120 C is 250 min-' with linear/branched product ratio (n/i) = 5.4. In the gas-phase reaction the activity is only 1.7 min-' but r/i = 46. The boiling point of the product, heptanal, is 35 C higher than the reaction temperature. Therefore, gas-phase reactions with supported liquid-phase catalysts are not limited to reactants which give only lowboiling point products. Introduction The potential advantages of homogeneous over heterogeneous catalysis in the same reaction are the greater selectivities of homogeneous catalysts, the more efficient use of the catalyst atoms, and the easily reproducible catalyst preparation. The disadvantages include the difficulties in continuous product removal and recovery of the catalyst, and lower conversions. Consequently, considerable attention has been focused or.. physical or chemical fixation of homogeneous catalysts on organic or inorganic supports to combine the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. Th~s can be done by chemical anchoring of the catalyst on the carrier by the use of support.ligazd chemical bonds [lI. or by dispersion of the catalyst within porous solids.. A third method was suggested independently by Acres et af. [21 and Rony [3j . The homogeneous catalyst is dissolved in a high boiling 258 solvent, supported on a porous or non-porous carrier, and employed as a \"supported liquid-phase catalyst\" (SLPC) in a fixed bed reactor. In such an SLPC system, the original liquid environment of the catalyst is preserved, its properties are not changed by chemical interaction with the support, and a loge gas-liquid contact area may be a further advantage. However, there is a drawback in using the SLPC in gas-phase reactions. In liquid-phase reactions the contact time of the reactants with the catalyst is practically unlimited but in gas-phase reactions the contact time is short. Therefore, a supported liquid-phase homogeneous catalyst must exhibit a very high activity or turp.over number (turnover number = moles products/moles catalyst X unit time) to obtain a good specific space-time yield (kg product mmol cat-1 1-1 h-1). We have recently shown that by a proper choice of metal and ligands homogeneous catalysts can be developed which have high turnover numbers under relatively mild conditions (pressure: 1 - 15 bar; T ^- 50 - 200 C) in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of alkenes, aldehydes, and ketones, and the hydroformylation of 1-hexene without solvent [4 - 7] . In the present study it will be demonstrated by means of a few examples that hydrogenation of aldehydes and ketones, and hydroformylation of 1-hexene, in the gas phase with SLPC is possible at reaction temperatures which are only slightly higher than the boiling point o_` the reactant and which are lower than the boiling point of the product. Rony [8] was the first to attempt the hydroformylation of propylene with SLPC-RihCIC0(P 3 )2. Recently, Gerritsen et a1. [9 - 12] published their results on the hydroformylation of propylene with SLPC-RhHCO(P 3 j3. To our knowledge there is no detailed information available on experiments with SLPC and reactants having boiling points near the reaction temperature. Experimental Apparatus As the reactor oven we used a Varian Aerograph 912 gas chromatograp'1. The liquid reactant was continuously injected into the injection port of the Aerograph by a `syringe-pump'. The g.c. column was replaced by the reactor tube filled with the SLPC. The end of the reactor tube was connected with a 6-way valve, having two outlets. One outlet was linked to a trap outside the reactor oven, the other was connected by a heated tube to the g.c. column of a second Aerograph (Varian 2800) with FID detectors. The product distribution was determined by a recorder in combination with a peak integrator (Varian CDS 111). By operation of the 6-way valve, 0.2 ml of the gaseous product-s were swept into the g.c. column of the second Aerograph without interrupting the flow in the reactor tube. The flow rate, F, of the outcoming gas was measured with a soap flowmeter in ml gas/min (N.T.P.) before the injection was started. 259 The method for hydrogenation and hydroformylation without solvent has already been described [4 - 7] . For these experiments a metal-glass apparatus was used [13] . Preparation of SLPC (a) Calculated amounts of the catalyst were dissolved in CHC13 and the high-boiling solvent added (all operation under nitrogen). The total volume or this catalyst solution was taken equal to the total pore volume of the support (Chromosorb PAW-DMCS; 80 - 120 mesh, pore volume: 1.1 ml/g; area 4m2 g; mean pore diameter: ?00 nm). The catalyst solution was added dropwise to the stirred support which was held at 70 C. Then the CHC13 was slowly evaporated at room temperature under a flow of CO/HZ or H~ according to whether the SLPC was to be used for hydroformylation or hydrogenation. Next the temperature was raised to 90 C for redistribution of the high-boiling solvent in the pore system. The dried, free-flowing carrier was transferred to glass colum :s. (b) After the catalyst solution was added dropwise to the stirred support at 70 C, the wet powder was cooled to 25 C and the CHC13 drawn off in a flash evaporator at 25 C under vacuum. Both preparation methods gave catalysts of identical acthrty. The complex compounds RhHCO(P 3)3 and RUC12(CO)2(P 3)2 were prepared by published methods [14, 15] . Results and discussion 'fable I presents the experimental data for the solution and gas-phase reacticor:s under comparable conditions. In the gas-phase hydrogenation of methylethylketone (No. 1) the catalyst activity is higher in the gas-phase than in solution (column X). The same holds for the specific space-time yield (column XII) which gives the kg of product produced in one hour in a reaction volume of one liter by one mmol oi catalyst- In solution, the total amount of an homogeneous catalyst which can be employed is limited by the catalyst solubility in the reactant and by the fact that at high catalyst concentration the uptake of the reaction gas becomes diffusion-controlled [7] . In gas-phase reactions with an SLPC the upper limit of the amount of the catalyst is also given by its solubility in the high boiling solvent, but conversion depends, furthermore - as Rony [3] has already pointed out - on the parameters given in formula (1) - F'(In polpi) = KkS E (I ) in which F = gas flow (ml/min), po and pl. are the partial pressures of the reactant at the gas outlet and inlet, I = partition coefficient, h = reaction rate constant, o = degree of liquid loading (volume of catalyst solution/ pore volume) and E = effectiveness coefficient- Cerritsen et al. found that TABLE 1 Comparison of catalyst activity, u, and specific space-time yield (s sp-t y) in solution rind gas-pliane reaction with SLPC (ue and ua: reactor volume in solution and gas-phase reaction; t = reaction time; Carbow.; Carbowax 1500; 6 = 0.33.)

Therefore, optimization of catalyst activity in gas-phase reactions with SLPC is much more complicated than in liquidphases reactions. In the solution experiments we optimized the reaction conditions to maximize the catalyst activity [4 - 7] , but in the SLPC reactions of 'Fable 1 it has not yet proved possible to optimize all the above mentioned parameters. From this point of view it is interesting that we found, in the hydrogenation of methylethyiketone with SLPC, a higher activity than for liquid-phase hydrogenation. In the hydrogenation of cyclohexanone (No. 2) the boiling points of the reactane and product are, by contrast with the experiment with methylethylketone, near or equal to the reaction temperature, and the catalyst activities for the solution and SLPC reactions are about the same. In the hydrogenation of aldehydes (Nos. 3 - 5), the catalyst activity in the solution reaction is higher by a factor of 2.5 - 10 than in the SLPC reaction. Interestingly, the speck space-time yields are practically the same in the gas-phase reaction and no by-products could be detected. Therefore, the short contact time [2] in gas-phase catalysis with SLPC may be an advantage. In the solution hydroformylation of 1-hexene ti, ~ catalyst activity at 120 C is very high (No. 6(a)) bTIt the ratio n/i of the cjL- to the iso-aldehyde is only 5.4. In the gas-phase reaction (No. 6(b)) the catalyst activity a = i.72 min-' and n/i is 46. Only two percent. of the iso-aldehyde is produced Under a flow of 30 ml/min in a reactor tube of 60 cm with an inner diameter, p, = 0.4 cm. At a flow rate of 60 ml/min (No. 6(c)) in a reaction tube of 300 cm and = 0.2 cm, conversion increases to 8090 and the catalyst activity increases by a factor of 2.75 but n/i decreased to Z3.4- In both experiments (Nos. 6(b), 6(c)) the pore loading, 5 , was 0.33. In experiment No. 6(c) with the higher conversion, the total amount of catalyst was lower than in No. 6(b). ihis result gives an indication that the ratio of the length to the diameter of the reaction tube at constant total volume of the reactor also hass an influence on the percentage of conversion. In the hydroformylatiort of propylene with SLPC-RhHCQ(PO3 )3 on certain silicas and silica--alunAna s-pports a long activation time was observed [11] . In our hydro'formylation of 1-hexene with RhHCO(P 3 )3 on Chromosorb no activation time could be detected, and we found no de-activation over a period of 50 h [151 . In the hydroformylation of propylene no deactivation was observed over a period of 800 h [9] . In the hydroformylation of propylene with SLPC-RhHCQ(P 3)3, dissolved in molten P 3 at 125 C with S = 0.44 under a pressure of 16 bar, the catalyst activity was found to be 35 miry i [9] . The results of kinetic studies on this reaction can be described by the power rate equation (2). The catalyst activity is proportional to the first power of the partial pressure of r = ko [RhjP V~6 (2) 26 2 propylene [ 12] . From this equation the catalyst activity at 3 bar total pressure is found to be 6.6 min-L, a value which is of the same magnitude as our value a = 4.73 min' in experiment No. 6(c), despite the fact that the experimental conditions are not completely comparable. In the six different solution experiments in Table 1, catalyst activities vary from 1.15 to 250 but in the SLPC reactions they only vary between 1.72 and 8.16. We believe that this results from the fact that the solution reactions are optimized, while the SLPC reactions are not. If more homogeneous catalysts of high activity are converted to SLPC faun and the reaction conditions optimized, gas-phase reactions with SLPC may be found to offer advantages over the true heterogeneous gas-phase catalysis.
