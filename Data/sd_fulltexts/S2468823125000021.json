A stable two-dimensional (2D) coordination polymer (CP), namely {[Zn(PMBA)(DMA)]}n (Zn-PMBA), was successfully designed and synthesized through solvothermal reaction of Zn(NO3)2 with semi-rigid dicarboxylic acid ligand 4′,4′''-[(phenylazanediyl)bis(methylene)]-bis[(1,1′-biphenyl)-2-carboxylic acid] (H2PMBA). Structural analysis shows that Zn-PMBA exhibits a two-dimensional planar structure composed of PMBA2- ligands connecting dinuclear zinc paddlewheel units. Interesting, due to the integration of exposed Zn metal centers and N atoms of tertiary amine endows Zn-PMBA with abundant Lewis basic and active metal sites, which can be used as a bi-functional and efficient catalyst for the formation of CC bond reaction under solvent-free condition. Therefore, Zn-PMBA exhibits extremely efficient catalytic performance and stability for both the Knoevenagel condensation reaction and the cyanosilylation with trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN). The outstanding catalytic performance remains consistent over at least five cycles, showing no substantial decline in activity. These results suggest that Zn-PMBA is stable and has high catalytic activity and can be used as a promising heterogeneous catalyst for CC bonds formation.

Almost all reactions that form CC bonds require the involvement of catalysts, but homogeneous organic catalysts or metal catalysts are always difficult to handle [2]. Therefore, the development and synthesis of highly efficient, easily separated and recyclable multiphase catalysts for CC bond reaction have always been the goal of catalysis workers [3,4]. In recent years, coordination polymers have increasingly come to people's attention as a fresh type of porous materials [5,6]. Researchers found that metal ions and organic ligands could be efficiently assembled via coordination bonds through rational design. The obtained coordination polymer not only has a larger specific surface volume and higher porosity, but also has rich structure and performance [7]. The result is that not only does it possess an extensive array of uses in gas adsorption, drug delivery, and sensitization, but also there is also great interest in the application of multiphase catalysis [8–10]. When used as a multiphase accelerator, it is simple to detach from the reaction system after the catalytic reaction. Simple washing can also be used to remove the reaction materials and solutes in the pore channel, and the catalytic activity will not decrease even after repeated cyclic use. On the catalytic reaction side, it is slightly better than the normal gold salt and other homogeneous catalysts. Throughout the catalytic reaction process, the occurrence of co-catalysis or tandem catalysis of acid and alkali sites isolated in the framework is often observed. In addition, it can also make sense to use the closed space to influence the activity of reaction or selectivity of the product [11,12]. The CPs have highly distributed catalytically active site, and the porous structure facilitate sufficient contact between the reaction substrate and the catalytically active site. Meanwhile, the CPs are capable of creating significant Lewis acid-base sites that facilitate the catalysis of various reactions, including Knoevenagel condensation (CC), Cyanosilylation of aldehydes reaction (CC), Strecker reaction (CN), and Clauson-Kaas (CN), etc. [13–17]. Knoevenagel condensation reaction is a weakly basic condensation reaction that plays a significant role in the CC bond formation reaction utilized in the synthesis of ɑ, β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, which are widely applied in pharmaceutical, flavor, and perfume industries [18–22]. And then, Cyanosilylation of aldehydes reaction also is an important intermediate of organic to both biology and synthetic chemistry [23–25]. However, the recovery of organic solvents and purification of products, as well as the disposal of reaction residues, pose significant challenges in terms of environmental protection [26]. We've been looking into the creation of functionalized CPs and how to apply them in heterogeneous catalysis [27–31]. In this paper, we report a stable 2D coordination polymer Zn-PMBA, was successfully synthesized through solvothermal reaction of Zn(NO3)2 with semi-rigid dicarboxylic acid ligand 4′,4′''-[(phenylazanediyl)bis(methylene)]-bis[(1,1′-biphenyl)−2-carboxylic acid] (H2PMBA) (Scheme 1). Structural analysis shows that Zn-PMBA exhibits a two-dimensional planar structure composed of PMBA2- ligands connecting dinuclear zinc paddlewheel units. Interesting, due to the integration of exposed Zn metal centers and N atoms of tertiary amine endows Zn-PMBA with abundant Lewis basic and active metal sites, which can be used as a bi-functional and efficient catalyst for the formation of CC bond reaction under solvent-free condition. Therefore, Zn-PMBA exhibits extremely efficient catalytic performance and stability for both the Knoevenagel condensation reaction and the cyanosilylation with trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN). The outstanding catalytic performance remains consistent over at least five cycles, showing no substantial decline in activity. These results suggest that Zn-PMBA is stable and has high catalytic activity and can be used as a promising heterogeneous catalyst for CC bonds formation. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Material and physical measurements All reagents were acquired commercially and utilized without further purification. Detailed synthetic procedures, Mass spectrum, 1H NMR spectrum of H2PMBA (Figure S1-S3) are provided in the Supporting Information, along with physical characterizations for Zn-PMBA. 2.2 Synthesis and crystallization Synthesis of {[Zn(PMBA)(DMA)]}n (Zn-PMBA). A mixture of ligand H2PMBA (25.6 mg, 0.05 mmol), and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (59.5 mg, 0.2 mmol) were taken in a 25 mL glass bottle and dissolved in 3 mL of dimethylacetamide (DMA), then added 2 mL of distilled water (DMA/H2O = 3/2 mL) and 25 μL of NaOH (2M). The mixture was sonicated for 20 min and placed in an oven at 100 °C for 3 days. After 3 days of constant reaction, the temperature was slowly lowed to room temperature and transparent, large, block-shaped, colorless single crystals were obtained with the yield of 25 % (based on the Zn). IR (cm−1): 3430 (m), 3020 (w), 2900 (w), 1649 (s), 1600 (s), 1506 (s), 1395 (s), 1004 (m), 739 (s). 2.3 Crystal data collection and refinement Crystallographic data of Zn-PMBA was collected on Rigaku Oxford Diffraction Supernova diffractometer with Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) in ω -φ scan mode at room temperature. Crystal structure was solved by used a direct method within the ShelXS-2014 and refined by least-squares refinements with ShelXL-2014 program to further improve the structure [32]. Meantime, anisotropic refinement was used for all non-hydrogen atoms. The detailed crystallographic data, selected bond lengths and bond angles of Zn-PMBA are summarized in supporting information (Table S1, S2). The full CIF data for Zn-PMBA can be obtained from Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center (CCDC numbers: 2,388,807). 2.4 Catalytic procedure for Knoevenagel reaction Before initiating catalytic reaction, the Zn-PMBA was activated through vacuum drying at 100 °C for a duration of 12 h. Subsequently, the activated catalyst (20 mg, 0.3 mol%), along with aromatic aldehyde (13 mmol) and malononitrile (10 mmol), was combined inside a sealed glass bottle and gently stirred for 12 h at ambient temperature. Upon completion of the reaction, the Zn-PMBA catalyst was separated via centrifugation, washed and recycled with methanol (CH3OH), and then dried in a vacuum drying oven for use. The product yields were then ascertained using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS). 2.5 Catalytic procedure for Cyanosilylation reaction A sealed glass bottle was charged with a mixture of primary aromatic aldehyde (12 mmol) and trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN, 10 mmol), along with 20 mg (0.3 mol%) of the activated Zn-PMBA catalyst. This reaction mixture underwent slow stirring at room temperature for a duration of 12 h. Upon completion of the reaction, the Zn-PMBA catalyst was separated via centrifugation, washed and recycled with methanol (CH3OH), and then dried in a vacuum drying oven for use. The product yields were then ascertained using GC–MS. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structure description of {[Zn(PMBA)(DMA)]}n (Zn-PMBA) Under solvothermal conditions, the synthesis of Zn-PMBA was achieved by heating a mixture containing H2PMBA and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O in DMA/ H2O (v/v:3/2) at 100 °C for 3 days. The analysis of X-ray single crystal diffraction structure reveals that the Zn-PMBA crystalizes in monoclinic crystal system, space group P21/c with unit cell parameters a = 10.6383(2) Å, b = 14.9032(2) Å, c = 23.8445(4) Å, α=90°, β=97.923° (2), γ=90°. The Fig. 1 a shows asymmetric unit of Zn-PMBA, which consists of one Zn2+, one PMBA2- and one DMA molecule. The coordination environment diagram of Zn2+ in the Zn-PMBA show eight oxygen atoms by four carboxyl groups come from four different PMBA2- coordinate with two Zn2+ions to assemble into a paddle-wheel structure unit of [Zn2(OOCR)4)] (Fig. 1b). Meanwhile, each DMA coordinates at one axis position of the paddle-wheel structure as displayed in Fig. 1b, where the Zn-O bond length ranges from 1.975 to 2.084 Å, with an average of 2.038 Å. Adjacent dinuclear [Zn2(OOCR)4)] were connected by four PMBA2- to assemble into a 2D planar structure (Fig. 1c). Noteworthy, the DMA of the paddle wheel structure can be removed by exchanging low boiling point methanol solvents, exposing Lewis acid sites for chemical catalytic reactions. 3.2 IR spectra, SEM and chemical stability analyses for Zn-PMBA The FT-IR data of H2PMBA, Zn-PMBA were shown in Figure S4-S5. The Zn-PMBA has a peak near 3430 cm-1 due to the OH tensile vibration of water. The peak at 1645 cm-1 for Zn-PMBA is attributed to C = O stretching vibration. Meanwhile, the characteristic absorption peak of the benzene ring in Zn-PMBA is observed at 1400 cm-1. Furthermore, the peak at 1200 cm-1 for Zn-PMBA corresponds the CO stretching vibration. At last, the CN stretching vibration for Zn-PMBA appears at 740 cm-1. The Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) data of pretreatment of Zn-PMBA before catalytic reaction showed that Zn-PMBA is flake powder crystal state. At the same time, the elemental mapping spectra of Zn-PMBA showed that the distribution of C, O, N, Zn elements is uniform (Figure S6). Meanwhile, Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis of Zn-PMBA was performed under nitrogen atmosphere in heating range of 25–900 °C with heating rate of 5 °C/min to study the thermal stability (Figure S7). The TGA of Zn-PMBA showed that it has possess high thermal stability. The Zn-PMBA is stable at 30–165 °C, and then the complex begins to decompose first. A rapid weight loss of 25.3 % in the temperature range of 166–211 °C is ascribed to the disintegration of solvent molecules and coordinated DMA molecules. As the temperature increases, the ligand slowly begins to decompose and ends at 900 °C with a weight loss of 61.5 %. The residual weight of 13.2 % corresponds to the formation of ZnO, slightly higher than the theoretical value of 12.2 %. The Zn-PMBA exhibits remarkable stability after exposure to various solvents at elevated temperatures for 24 h. The stability was assessed by immersing the sample in different organic solvents, such as acetonitrile, toluene, DMA, ethanol, and acetone. Powder X-ray diffraction analyses confirmed that all observed diffraction peaks align well with the simulated pattern, demonstrating that the structure of Zn-PMBA remains intact following solvent treatment (Fig. 2 ). 3.3 Catalysis studies The integration of exposed Zn metal centers and N atoms of tertiary amine endows Zn-PMBA with abundant Lewis basic and active metal sites, which can be used as a bi-functional and efficient catalyst for the significant Knoevenagel condensation and cyanosilylation of aldehydes reactions. Knoevenagel Condensation Reaction. A known to all, the Knoevenagel condensation reaction is a weakly basic condensation reaction that plays a significant role in the CC bond formation reaction utilized in the synthesis of biopharmaceutical products and fine green chemicals [33–35]. Herein, in the reaction, malononitrile and benzaldehyde were chosen as model substrates to test the catalytic activity by of Zn-PMBA in a solvent-free system at room temperature. The product yields were ascertained using GC–MS (Table 1 ). As shown in Table 1, aromatic benzaldehyde and malononitrile were selected with a molar ratio of 1.3:1 and the catalyst loading was 0.3 mol% for the catalytic reaction. After 12 h of reaction at room temperature, the product yield could reach 100 % and TON value was 333.3 (Table 1, entry 1). However, it is noteworthy that the yield of target product is very low when the reaction was carried out without a catalyst (Table 1, entry 10), suggesting the superior catalytic performance of Zn-PMBA for the Knoevenagel reaction. On the side, in order to prove the active Lewis basic sites, H2PMBA was used as a catalyst for condensation reaction. For the substrate benzaldehyde, a lower conversion rate was obtained (32.5 %), while using Zn-PMBA as catalyst, a significantly higher conversion rate (100 %) was observed (Table 1, entry 9). To determine effect of catalyst dosage and reaction time on product yield, we conducted a series of experiments to determine the optimal catalyst dosage and reaction time (Fig. 3 ). It can be seen from Fig. 3a that as the quantity of catalyst increased from 0 mg to 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg, the yield of target product, benzylidenemalononitrile has been increased from 9.7 %, 32.4 %, 53.1 %, 86.6 % and 100 %. It has been confirmed that maximal yield of 100 % was achieved in 12 h. Whenever, the catalyst leached out from reaction mixture after 3 h of reaction, the rate of reaction and yield of product has been stoped at 45.3 % as shown in Fig. 3b. Removal of the catalyst by filtration during the reaction showed almost no change in the yield of the product, indicating that the catalyst was the most important to the reaction. Considering the high catalytic activity of Zn-PMBA, in order to further investigate the universality of Zn-PMBA, the reactions of malononitrile with various substituted aromatic aldehydes were investigated. As demonstrated by the catalytic outcomes (Table 1) and comparison with the previously similar published reports, the catalytic yield of the aromatic aldehydes derivatives was good to excellent. It is obvious that substituents on benzaldehyde derivatives significantly affect the catalytic yield of the aldehyde-malononitrile condensation reaction [36,37]. The recyclability and stability of the Zn-PMBA were examined using benzaldehyde as a substrate. After a 12 h catalytic reaction, Zn-PMBA was retrieved by filtration, then washed with CH3OH, and finally redeployed in subsequent reactions. As depicted in Figure S8, the conversion rate of benzaldehyde remained above 98 % even after five consecutive cycles. Additionally, XRD patterns obtained before and after in catalytic reactions confirmed that, the structure of Zn-PMBA remained unchanged, indicating its robustness under these conditions (Figure S8). Cyanosilylation Reaction. Cyanohydrins, an important intermediate of organic to both biology and synthetic chemistry, can be synthesized through the cyanosilylation of aldehydes [38]. This cyanosilylation process is widely recognized for its role in CC bond formation catalyzed by Lewis acids. Over recent decades, an array of homogeneous catalysts, including alkaline-earth metal oxides, metal salts, and amines etc., have been extensively employed in the cyanosilylation reactions of aldehydes [39]. Herein, the cyanosilylation of benzaldehyde was chosen as model substrates to investigate the catalytic activity by of Zn-PMBA in a solvent-free system at room temperature. The product yields following the catalytic reaction were determined using GC–MS analysis (Table 2 ). By adjusting and optimizing the reaction conditions, the optimal reaction conditions of the benzaldehyde (12 mmol) and TMSCN (10 mmol) by using catalyst of Zn-PMBA (0.3 mol %) at room temperature were determined. After the reaction for 12 h, benzaldehyde was completely converted to 2-phenyl-2-trimethylsilyloxyacetonitrile (100 %) and TON value is 333.3 (Table 2, entry 1). For comparison, a control experiment was carried out in the absence of any catalyst under identical conditions. This resulted in a substantial decrease in product yield from 100 % to just 12.1 %, clearly illustrating the superior catalytic effect of Zn-PMBA on cyanosilylation reaction (Table 2, entry 10). Furthermore, using H2PMBA as catalyst, a homogeneous control experiment was carried out. Under these homogeneous conditions, the conversion of benzaldehyde to 2-phenyl-2-trimethylsilyloxyacetonitrile was significantly lower at 30.1 %. In contrast, with Zn-PMBA as the catalyst, the conversion rate reached an impressive 100 %, highlighting the critical importance of Zn-PMBA for achieving high reaction efficiency (Table 2, entry 9). To investigate the broader effectiveness of Zn-PMBA as a catalyst in the cyanosilylation reaction, various benzaldehyde derivatives were employed as substrates (Table 2). The catalytic yields for these aromatic aldehyde derivatives ranged from good to excellent, and comparison with the previously similar published reports (Table S4). It is evident that the nature of the substituents on the benzaldehyde derivatives significantly affects the yield of the cyanosilylation process [40,41]. The stability and recyclability of the Zn-PMBA catalyst were examined using benzaldehyde as a substrate. After a 12 h catalytic reaction, Zn-PMBA was retrieved by filtration, then washed with CH3OH, and finally redeployed in subsequent reactions. As depicted in Figure S9, the conversion rate of benzaldehyde remained above 98 % even after five consecutive cycles. Additionally, XRD patterns obtained before and after in catalytic reactions confirmed that, the structure of Zn-PMBA remained unchanged, indicating its robustness under these conditions (Figure S9). The catalytic outcomes of the Knoevenagel and Cyanosilylation reactions reveal that electron-withdrawing groups enhance the susceptibility of imine or carbonyl functionalities to nucleophilic attacks, thereby elevating the reaction's conversion rate [42,43]. Conversely, electron-donating groups diminish this conversion efficiency. Moreover, a stronger electron-withdrawing capacity in a substituent correlates with a heightened vulnerability of the carbonyl or imine carbon to nucleophilic assaults, accelerating the overall catalytic process [44,45]. The successful synthesis of products was validated through GC–MS analysis (Figure S10, S11). The Knoevenagel reaction mechanism between benzaldehyde and malononitrile is highly similar to that reported by many authors in the literature [46]. The Zn-PMBA complex can potentially serve as an acid-base catalyst for this reaction. In this complex, the basic and acidic sites can cooperatively catalyze the reaction with enhanced efficiency. The unsaturated metal nodes of Zn-PMBA can function as active Lewis acidic catalytic sites, and the nitrogen in the ligand can act as a basic site. This favors the efficient catalytic performance of Zn-PMBA when interacting with the substrates. The likely mechanism of the Knoevenagel reaction on Lewis acidic/basic sites is shown in Fig. 4 . The proposed mechanism starts with the attack of the polarized carbonyl oxygen of the aldehyde on the metal node of the Zn-PMBA. Subsequently, the nitrogen of the ligand attacks the Lewis acidic site of malononitrile. The carbanion is generated when the nitrogen removes the acidic proton from the methylene group. This carbanion then attacks the carbanion of benzaldehyde, forming an intermediate. This intermediate undergoes rearrangement and dehydration to yield the desired product, 2-benzylidenemalononitrile. Based on the catalytic results discussed above, a potential mechanism for the cyanosilylation reaction has been suggested, drawing from earlier studies [47]. This proposed mechanism begins with the polarized carbonyl oxygen of the aldehyde attacking the metal nodes of Zn-PMBA, which is then followed by an attack from the nitrogen atom of the ligand at the acidic site of TMSCN. Then CN as an electrophile of TMSCN attacks at carbanion of benzaldehyde to give an intermediate, and then transfer negative charge to ligand nitrogen to give the required product as 2-phenyl-2-trimethylsilyloxyacetonitrile. The catalytic mechanisms described involve the activated Lewis acid metal center engaging with the electrophilic oxygen atoms present in the substrate. This interaction polarizes groups of PMBA2- ligand, which subsequently increases the nucleophilicity of the carbonyl carbon atom. In addition, nitrogen atom within the Zn-PMBA ligand acts as a basic site, imparting basic characteristics to the complex and facilitating the activation of relevant nucleophilic reagents. Consequently, this serves as a fundamental driving force behind the catalytic reaction. 4 Conclusions In summary, a stable 2D coordination polymer, namely {[Zn(PMBA)(DMA)]}n (Zn-PMBA), was successfully designed and synthesized through solvothermal reaction of Zn(NO3)2 with semi-rigid dicarboxylic acid ligand H2PMBA. Structural analysis shows that Zn-PMBA exhibits a two-dimensional planar structure composed of PMBA2- ligands connecting dinuclear zinc paddlewheel units. Interesting, due to the integration of exposed Zn metal centers and N atoms of tertiary amine endows Zn-PMBA with abundant Lewis basic and active metal sites, which can be used as a bi-functional and efficient catalyst for the formation of CC bond reaction under solvent-free condition. Therefore, Zn-PMBA exhibits extremely efficient catalytic performance and stability for both the Knoevenagel condensation reaction and the cyanosilylation with TMSCN. The outstanding catalytic performance remains consistent over at least five cycles, showing no substantial decline in activity. These results suggest that Zn-PMBA is stable and has high catalytic activity and can be used as a promising heterogeneous catalyst for CC bonds formation.

        "dc:description": "A stable two-dimensional (2D) coordination polymer (CP), namely {[Zn(PMBA)(DMA)]}n (Zn-PMBA), was successfully designed and synthesized through solvothermal reaction of Zn(NO3)2 with semi-rigid dicarboxylic acid ligand 4′,4′''-[(phenylazanediyl)bis(methylene)]-bis[(1,1′-biphenyl)-2-carboxylic acid] (H2PMBA). Structural analysis shows that Zn-PMBA exhibits a two-dimensional planar structure composed of PMBA2- ligands connecting dinuclear zinc paddlewheel units. Interesting, due to the integration of exposed Zn metal centers and N atoms of tertiary amine endows Zn-PMBA with abundant Lewis basic and active metal sites, which can be used as a bi-functional and efficient catalyst for the formation of CC bond reaction under solvent-free condition. Therefore, Zn-PMBA exhibits extremely efficient catalytic performance and stability for both the Knoevenagel condensation reaction and the cyanosilylation with trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN). The outstanding catalytic performance remains consistent over at least five cycles, showing no substantial decline in activity. These results suggest that Zn-PMBA is stable and has high catalytic activity and can be used as a promising heterogeneous catalyst for CC bonds formation.",
