Chemical Research Group Research Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth (RITE) 9-2 Kizugawadai Kizugawa Kyoto 619-0292 Japan Graphical abstract We investigate the effect of the crystalline structure of iron oxide catalysts on oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of n-butene. ODH reactions of n-butene were carried out with a fixed-bed flow reactor at 450 °C under a but-1-ene (1-C4H8) or cis-but-2-ene (cis-2-C4H8)(mL/min)/O2(mL/min) flow ratio of 5/2.5. Of the various iron oxide-based catalysts (α-, β-, γ-, ε-Fe2O3, Fe3O4, ZnFe2O4), ε-Fe2O3 showed the highest ODH activity. To the best of our knowledge, ε-Fe2O3 has never been used for the ODH of n-butene. Moreover, the catalytic performance of ε-Fe2O3 was improved by adding SiO2, which is related to the maintenance of its structure and improves its redox property. A high BD selectivity of 65 % and BD yield of 18 % were then obtained for 4 h without deactivation. This catalyst can be applied to the ODH of cis-2-C4H8 and is proposed as the noble high catalytic performance catalyst for the ODH of n-butene. Keywords Epsilon iron oxide Oxidative dehydrogenation n-Butene Buta-1,3-diene 1 Introduction One of the principal intermediate products in the petrochemical industry is buta-1,3-diene (BD). The demand for BD is increasing, as it is as a major building block in the industry and can be mostly produced by the steam cracking of naphtha. However, this process must be operated at temperatures over 700 °C, and the endothermic reaction thus requires a lot of energy. In addition, the steam cracking of naphtha shows the low BD selectively because light olefins such as ethene and propylene were produced. Due to the shale gas revolution, ethane can be cheaply supplied; the substrate used in cracking to produce ethylene transfers from naphtha to ethane derived from the shale gas. Therefore, in terms of a near-future supply of BD, an alternative production process is needed. Recently, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of C4 fraction (Eq. (1)), which is an exothermic reaction, has attracted attention. This reaction is very useful from the viewpoint of energy conservation, and it has been proposed as a process for the efficient production of BD. (1) C 4 H 8 + 1/2 O 2 → C 4 H 6 + H 2 O Δ H o = -132 .1 kJ/mol However, ODH has a serious problem in that the complete oxidation of reactant and product to CO2 proceeds easily (Eqs. (2) and (3)). (2) C 4 H 8 + 6 O 2 → 4C O 2 + 4 H 2 O Δ H o = -2540 .8 kJ/mol (3) C 4 H 8 + 4 O 2 → 4CO + 4 H 2 O Δ H o = -1409 .0 kJ/mol In order to inhibit complete oxidation, the ODH of n-butene has been carried out under an O2 flow with a large amount of steam [1]. However, since the latent heat of steam is large, this requires a lot of energy. The ODHs of n-butene and propane have also been performed using the lattice oxygen of a catalyst in order to prevent the complete oxidation of the substrates (Eqs. (4) and (5)) [2,3]. However, this approach has not been suitable for the continuous BD production over a long duration because it requires the regeneration of the catalyst used. (4) C4H8 + MOx → C4H6 + H2O + MOx-1 (5) MOx-1 + 1/2O2 → MOx For effective and continuous BD production, it would be preferable to conduct the ODH of n-butane and n-butene under O2 flow without steam. Various effective catalysts such as Bi-Mo composite oxide [4–13], ferrite type [14–27], and V-containing [28–30] have been proposed for the ODH of n-butene and n-butane. Among these catalysts, the Bi-Mo composite oxide and ferrite type catalysts have been widely studied. It has been reported that the ODH reaction with these catalysts proceeds through the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism [4,5]. This mechanism is a redox cycle with the lattice oxygen in the metal oxide, and the reactivity of lattice oxygen in the metal oxide during the ODH reaction is a crucial factor in determining the catalytic performance. On the other hand, the effect of the crystalline structure of the catalyst on the ODH has often been discussed [7,17,19]. The Bi-Mo complex oxide has α-Bi2Mo3O12, β-Bi2Mo2O9, and γ-Bi2MoO6. Generally, the catalytic activity for the ODH of n-butene is on the order of γ>α  [7]. β-Bi2Mo2O9 is therefore inappropriate for the ODH, because it decomposes to α and γ at the reaction temperature of 400–550 °C [6]. It is suggested that this order is consistent with lattice oxygen reactivity [31]. In the case of an iron oxide catalyst, it is reported that ferrite type catalysts with a spinel structure can exhibit high ODH activity, and the presence of α-Fe2O3 leads to low ODH performance [17,19]. Thus, extensive study of the effect of the crystallite structure on the ODH is important to the development of a catalyst with high catalytic performance. Iron oxide has various crystalline structures, including α-, β-, γ-, and ε-Fe2O3, and each the single phase can be easily synthesized. Meanwhile, detailed investigation of the crystalline phase of iron oxide in various ODH reactions has not yet been conducted. Therefore, in this study we examined the effect of the crystalline structure of iron oxide on the ODH of n-butene. We were able to propose an effective iron oxide catalyst for the ODH reaction. In order to achieve efficient BD production, the ODH of butenes was carried out under O2 flow without steam, and catalytic performance stability during the ODH was also investigated. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (assay = min. 99.0 %), FeSO4·7H2O (assay = 99–102 %), Fe2(SO4)3·nH2O (assay = 60–80 %), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (assay = min. 99.0 %), NaOH (assay = min. 97.0 %), 28 %NH3 solution, n-octane (assay = min. 98 %), butan-1-ol (assay = min. 99 %), acetone (assay = min. 99.5 %), methanol (assay = min. 99.8 %), NaCl (assay = 99.5 %), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) (assay = min. 95.0 %), and Fe3O4 were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, and used for the preparation of iron oxide catalysts. But-1-ene (1-C4H8) (assay = min. 99.0 %) was supplied by Sumitomo Seika Chemical. Cis-but-2-ene (cis-2-C4H8) (assay = min. 99.0 %) was supplied by Takachiho Chemical Industrial Co., Ltd. 2.2 Preparation of various iron oxide catalysts α-Fe2O3 was prepared by the precipitation method. Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (10 mmol) was dissolved in 100 mL of pure water. The solution was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. After stirring, 1 mol/L of NaOH solution was added to the solution under vigorous stirring until the pH reached 10. After stirring for 1 h, the resultant precipitate was separated by centrifugation, and the solid was washed with a large amount of pure water until the pH reached 7−8. It was then dried at 110 °C overnight in an oven. The solid was calcined at 500 °C for 2 h in air. γ-Fe2O3 was prepared by the same method. FeSO4·7H2O (10 mmol) was used as a precursor, and the calcination was carried out at 400 °C. β-Fe2O3 was prepared as described in previous reports [32,33]. First, Fe2(SO4)3 was prepared by calcining Fe2(SO4)3·nH2O at 400 °C under N2 flow. Fe2(SO4)3 and NaCl at a molar ratio of 1:2 were mixed in a mortar for 30 min. The mixed material was calcined at 550 °C for 2 h in air. The calcined product was added to pure water, and stirred at room temperature overnight. After stirring, the solid was filtered, washed with a large amount of pure water, and dried at 110 °C overnight in an oven. ε-Fe2O3-SiO2 was first prepared with reference to previous reports [34–36]. That is, ε-Fe2O3-SiO2 was prepared by the reverse micelle method. Fe(NO3)3·9H2O was dissolved in a mixed solution of pure water, n-octane, and butan-1-ol. CTAB at H2O/CTAB = 30/1 (mol/mol) was added to the mixed solution containing Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, and stirred until dissolved (Solution 1). Next, the solution was changed from Fe(NO3)3·9H2O to 28 % NH3.aq, prepared with the same method as Solution 1 (Solution 2). Solution 2 was added drop-wise to Solution 1, and the slurry obtained was stirred for 30 min. TEOS was added to the slurry to yield a weight ratio of (Fe2O3)/(SiO2+Fe2O3) = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5, and stirred overnight. After stirring, slurries were separated by centrifugation. Obtained solids were washed with a mixed solvent of acetone and methanol (volume ratio = 1/1), and then dried at 60 °C in an oven for 5 h. The solid was calcined at 1050 °C for 4 h in air. The different Fe2O3-containing catalysts were prepared by varying the amount of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O. Here, the notation is ε-Fe2O3(X)-SiO2, where X is Fe2O3 content (wt%). Pure ε-Fe2O3 was obtained by the following process. SiO2 in ε-Fe2O3(50)-SiO2 was dissolved in 1 mol/L NaOH solution at 60 °C overnight, and the solid was filtered, washed with a large amount of pure water, and dried at 110 °C overnight in an oven. ZnFe2O4 was prepared as previously reported [19]. Briefly, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O were dissolved in 100 mL of pure water. The mixed solution was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. After stirring, 3 mol/L of NaOH solution was added to the solution under vigorous stirring to reach pH 9. After stirring at room temperature for 12 h, it was aged overnight. The resultant precipitate was separated by centrifugation, the solid was washed with a large amount of pure water until pH was 7–8, and then it was dried at 175 °C for 16 h. The solid was calcined at 650 °C for 2 h in air. 2.3 Catalyst characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of iron oxide catalysts were obtained by the powder method using a Rigaku RINT-TTRIII diffractometer with monochromatic CuKα radiation under the following conditions: tube voltage 40 kV, tube current 30 mA, scan step 0.02 degrees, scan region 10–80 degrees, and scan speed 4.0 degrees/min. 2.4 Catalyst test 2.4.1 ODH of n-butene with iron oxide catalyst under O2 atmosphere The ODH of 1-C4H8 was carried out using a fixed-bed flow quartz reactor at 450 °C under atmospheric pressure. After 200 mg of the catalyst was placed in the reactor, it was preheated to a reaction temperature of 450 °C under 22.5 mL/min (STP) of Ar flow. Oxygen, 1-C4H8 or cis-2-C4H8, and Ar were introduced at a flow rate of O2/1-C4H8 or cis-2-C4H8/Ar = 2.5/5/22.5 mL/min (STP). Total gas flow rate was fixed at 30 mL/min. The C4 fractions (1-C4H8, cis-2-C4H8, trans-2-C4H8, and C4H6) were analyzed using a flame ionization detector (FID) gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC14B, column: Unicarbon A-400). CH4, CO, and CO2 were also analyzed with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) gas chromatograph (column: activated carbon). O2 and H2 were analyzed by TCD gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC8A, column: molecular sieves 5A). 2.4.2 ODH of but-1-ene with lattice oxygen in iron oxide catalyst The ODH of 1-C4H8 was carried out using the fixed-bed flow quartz reactor at 450 °C under atmospheric pressure. After 200 mg of the catalyst was placed in the reactor, it was preheated to a reaction temperature of 450 °C under 25 mL/min (STP) of Ar flow. Then, 5 mL/min of 1-C4H8 and 25 mL/min of Ar were introduced for 5 min. Reoxidation was carried out after the reaction under 5 mL/min of O2 and 25 mL/min of Ar for 10 min at 450 °C. Quantification of the products was carried out using the same equipment as in Section 2.4.1. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Effect of crystal phase of iron oxide on the ODH Fig. 1 presents the XRD patterns of various iron oxide catalysts. α-Fe2O3 and γ-Fe2O3 showed α-Fe2O3 and γ-Fe2O3 diffraction peaks, respectively (Fig. 1(a), (d)). Formation of ε-Fe2O3 and β-Fe2O3 in the single phase could be confirmed with diffraction peaks matching those reported in the literature (Fig. 1(b), (c)) [33,36,37]. Fig. 2 shows the effect of the crystallite structure of various iron oxides on the ODH of 1-C4H8. Although all the iron oxide catalysts showed a high O2 conversion of more than 95 % (data not shown in Fig. 2), we give the different catalytic performances in each iron oxide catalyst. The α-Fe2O3 catalyst mainly progressed the complete oxidation, because a high CO2 selectivity of 47.6 % and the lowest BD yield of 2.8 % were given. When γ- and β-Fe2O3 were used for the ODH, these catalysts exhibited a high 1-C4H8 conversion of more than 20 %, and BD yields of more than 10 %. In the case of ε-Fe2O3, this catalyst showed the highest 1-C4H8 conversion of 43.5 % and lower CO2 selectivity of 16.6 % than other iron oxides; the highest BD yield of 17.1 % was also obtained. Moreover, ε-Fe2O3 showed higher catalytic activity compared to Fe3O4 and ZnFe2O4 that were already reported here (Fig. S1). Among various iron oxide catalysts, ε-Fe2O3 exhibited the highest ODH activity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful result showing the high activity of ε-Fe2O3 for the ODHs of various substrates, such as propane and but-1-ene. In order to understand the effect of the crystalline structure of iron oxide on the ODH in the absence of molecular O2, we carried out ODH with lattice oxygen in iron oxide. Fig. 3 presents our results. α-Fe2O3 showed a low 1-C4H8 conversion of 9.9 % and low BD selectivity of 15.6 %. While γ-Fe2O3 showed a high conversion of 24.4 %, this catalyst exhibited high CO2 selectivity of 22.1 %. Therefore, γ-Fe2O3 progressed the complete oxidation. Although β-Fe2O3 indicated low conversion of 13.8 %, it produced the highest BD selectivity of 56.9 %. Surprisingly, ε-Fe2O3 showed the highest conversion of 46.4 %, and the high BD selectivity of 49.9 %. The order of BD yield was thus: ε-Fe2O3 (23.2 %) > β-Fe2O3 (7.9 %) > γ-Fe2O3 (5.5 %) > α-Fe2O3 (1.6 %). These results clarified that the lattice oxygen in ε-Fe2O3 was effectively used for the ODH of 1-C4H8. The unique performance of ε-Fe2O3 appeared to be related to the ODH of 1-C4H8 in the presence of O2. When the specific surface area of various iron oxide catalysts was measured (Table 1 ), the order of specific surface area was following: γ-Fe2O3>ε-Fe2O3>α-Fe2O3. Generally, the specific surface area depends on the particle size or the controlled pore structure. The order of particle size may be α-Fe2O3>ε-Fe2O3>γ-Fe2O3 because the pore structure is not controlled. On the other hand, the order of ODH activity was ε-Fe2O3>γ-Fe2O3>α-Fe2O3. Therefore, it is considered that the specific surface area of the catalyst is not related to ODH activity. This fact indicated that the ODH activity strongly depends on the crystallite structure of iron oxide rather than the specific surface area and particle size. On the other hand, it is reported that the α-Fe2O3/ZnFe2O4 biphasic catalyst showed the high ODH performance. According to the research, n-butene was interacted with ZnFe2O4 and ZnAl2O4 which have the spinel structure, and the activated butene reacted with the lattice oxygen in α-Fe2O3 to produce BD [38]. In other words, this result indicated that iron-based catalyst combined corundum structure and spinel structure is more effective for the ODH of n-butene. When ε-Fe2O3 was focused, ε-Fe2O3 has the crystalline structure that combine corundum structure (α-Fe2O3) and spinel structure (γ-Fe2O3). Therefore, it is considered that ε-Fe2O3 catalyst could show the particularly high ODH activity. 3.2 Stability of ε-Fe2O3 catalyst for ODH Catalytic performance stability for the ODH reaction is an important factor for the efficient production of BD. Therefore, we conducted a stability test of ε-Fe2O3. Fig. 4 shows the result of ODH and XRD analysis before and after the reaction. Although ε-Fe2O3 showed the high BD yield of 17.1 % for 30 min, after 60 min, the 1-C4H8 conversion decreased from 34.3 to 27.8 %, while CO2 selectivity increased from 20.5 to 25.5%. Unfortunately, the BD yield decreased from 17.1 % to 13.7 % (Fig. 4(a)). To examine the reason for the decrease in the ODH activity, XRD analyses of the catalyst before and after the ODH were conducted. As shown in Fig. 4(b), ε-Fe2O3 diffraction peaks observed before the ODH disappeared after the reaction, and Fe3O4 diffraction peaks appeared after the reaction for 2 h. In the ODH of 1-C4H8, it has been reported that the ODH activity of the iron oxide-based catalyst declined due to the formation of divalent iron oxide species during the reaction [26,27]. Actually, the Fe3O4 catalyst showed low ODH activity (Fig. S1). Therefore, it is considered that the catalytic performance was decreased due to it changing from ε-Fe2O3 to a reduced iron oxide such as Fe3O4 during the ODH. On the other hand, Wan et al. reported that catalytic activity for the ODH of n-butene is related to the oxidation and reduction cycle (redox cycle) through the lattice oxygen in the metal oxide [11]. Hence, the ODH with the lattice oxygen in the catalyst and regeneration with O2 were carried out using ε-Fe2O3. The crystallite phase of ε-Fe2O3 after the ODH with lattice oxygen and regeneration with O2 were then also analyzed by XRD. The results are shown in Fig. 5 . In the first ODH reaction (Fig. 5(a)), a high BD yield of 23 % was obtained. Although the 1-C4H8 conversion (53.7 %) of the second reaction was higher than that (46.4 %) of the first reaction, low BD selectivity of 19.2 % and BD yield of 10.3 % were observed. These results indicated that the lattice oxygen in ε-Fe2O3 could be used to produce BD, but could not be regenerated with O2. Thus, BD yield decreased in the second ODH. According to XRD analysis of ε-Fe2O3 after the ODH using the lattice oxygen and the regeneration using O2 (Fig. 5(b)), diffraction peaks attributable to Fe3O4 were shown in the catalyst (Fig. 5(b-2)), and those of γ-Fe2O3 in the catalyst after regeneration with O2 (Fig. 5(b-3)). This result clearly indicates that ε-Fe2O3 was reduced to Fe3O4, and could not be regenerated to ε-Fe2O3 by molecular O2. This suggested that keeping the redox property of the lattice oxygen of the ε-Fe2O3 phase is very important to maintaining ODH activity under O2 flow. 3.3 Effect of addition of SiO2 to the catalyst on the ODH As mentioned above, the ε-Fe2O3 catalyst showed the highest ODH activity among the iron oxide catalysts and was proposed as a novel catalyst. However, it was deactivated due to changes in the crystalline structure during the reaction and failure of the redox cycle. Therefore, we attempted to improve catalytic performance stability. Studies have proposed Fe2O3/SiO2 as a good catalyst with high catalytic performance for high-temperature sulfuric acid decomposition [37,39]. According to the literature, the redox property of metal oxide is an important factor in determining the reaction rate, and it has been reported that Fe2O3/SiO2 showed the better redox property among various iron oxide-based catalysts. It was also reported that Fe2O3 containing Al2O3, CaO, and SiO2 showed high redox cycle stability for the cyclic water gas shift process. Thus, SiO2 seems to be related to inhibition of iron species sintering by physical blocking [40]. We therefore expected that the redox property could be improved by including SiO2 in the iron oxide. On the other hand, ε-Fe2O3 can be formed by calcining iron oxide (γ-Fe2O3) coated with SiO2 at 1050 °C [36]. Hence, to maintain the catalytic activity during the ODH, we investigated the effect of ε-Fe2O3 containing SiO2 on the ODH of 1-C4H8 under O2 flow. ε-Fe2O3(50 wt%)-containing SiO2 catalyst (ε-Fe2O3(50)-SiO2) was used for the reaction. Fig. 6 (a) shows the results of ODH with an ε-Fe2O3(50)-SiO2 catalyst. Although the ε-Fe2O3(50)-SiO2 catalyst showed a high 1-C4H8 conversion of 22.5 %, and a BD yield of 13.0 % was obtained in the reaction for 30 min, after 60 min, this catalyst showed a higher BD yield (ca.18 %) than that of pure ε-Fe2O3. In addition, no deactivation was observed during the reaction for 4 h. Therefore, the ε-Fe2O3 containing SiO2 catalyst had a higher catalytic performance than pure ε-Fe2O3. In order to understand the effect of adding SiO2 on the ODH reaction, N2 adsorption, XRD and FT-IR analyses were conducted. From N2 adsorption, the both ε-Fe2O3 and ε-Fe2O3-SiO2 catalysts showed almost the same value (Table S1). This result indicated that pore property in catalyst was not related to the catalytic activity and the stability of catalyst. When XRD analyses of the ε-Fe2O3(50)-SiO2 catalyst before and after the ODH were conducted, ε-Fe2O3 diffraction peaks were observed in the catalyst even after the ODH (Fig. 6(b)). Moreover, from the result of FT-IR, although all ε-Fe2O3 phase in pure ε-Fe2O3 catalyst was converted to Fe3O4 phase after reaction, ε-Fe2O3(50)-SiO2 catalyst contained only ε-Fe2O3 phase without the formation of Fe3O4 (Fig. S2). Thus, this result is indicated that the amorphous iron oxide species other than ε-Fe2O3 phase, which cannot confirm with XRD analysis, did not exist in the used ε-Fe2O3(50)-SiO2. Unlike pure ε-Fe2O3, we found that the stability of the ε-Fe2O3 phase could be improved by SiO2, and that maintenance of the ε-Fe2O3 phase led to increased ODH activity and stability during the reaction. We also examined the redox property of the lattice oxygen in the ε-Fe2O3(50)-SiO2 catalyst through repeated ODH. The results are shown in Fig. 7 . The low 1-C4H8 conversion of 22.4 %, high BD selectivity of 49.2 %, and low BD yield of 11 % were obtained in the first ODH reaction (Fig. 7(a)). The result showed lower lattice oxygen reactivity than that of pure ε-Fe2O3. This is because the amount of lattice oxygen that could be used for the ODH was probably half that of pure ε-Fe2O3. Meanwhile, when the ODH with the lattice oxygen in the reoxidized ε-Fe2O3(50)-SiO2 was carried out, the 1-C4H8 conversion of 23.3 %, BD selectivity of 45.7 %, and BD yield of 10.7 % were similar to the results in the first ODH. This indicated that the used lattice oxygen in ε-Fe2O3 containing SiO2 could be easily regenerated by molecular O2. XRD analysis (Fig. 7(b)) revealed that ε-Fe2O3 diffraction peaks were not evident in ε-Fe2O3(50)-SiO2 after the reaction with the lattice oxygen, and the small diffraction peaks related to Fe3O4 were also observed (Fig. 7(b-2)). Surprisingly, after reoxidation with molecular O2, the catalyst showed ε-Fe2O3 diffraction peaks (Fig. 7(b-3)). Therefore, after the ODH with the lattice oxygen, ε-Fe2O3(50)-SiO2 could be restructured to the ε-Fe2O3 phase by O2. Results of the XRD analyses and repeated ODH showed that SiO2 improved the redox property of the lattice oxygen in ε-Fe2O3 compared to pure ε-Fe2O3. As above the results, the fact, that the other iron oxide species such as Fe3O4 in ε-Fe2O3(50)-SiO2 after the ODH under O2 flow were not seen, seems to be related to improvement of the redox property. In addition, improvement of redox property led to the high catalytic activity and stability during the ODH under O2 flow. 3.4 Effect of ε-Fe2O3 content on the ODH The usefulness of ε-Fe2O3 in SiO2 for the ODH was suggested. Therefore, we investigated the effect of ε-Fe2O3 content on the ODH. We tested ε-Fe2O3(10, 20, 50)-SiO2 and pure ε-Fe2O3 for the ODH. XRD analyses were carried out, and the results are shown in Fig. 8 . The ε-Fe2O3 diffraction peaks appeared in all the catalysts, and amorphous SiO2 peaks were observed in ε-Fe2O3(10, 20, 50)-SiO2. Fig. 9 shows the results of the ODH using ε-Fe2O3(10, 20, 50)-SiO2. As mentioned in Sections 3.2 and 3.3, the pure ε-Fe2O3 catalyst gave the high 1-C4H8 conversion of 34.3 % and high BD yield of 17.1 % for 30 min. However, after 30 min, a decrease in BD selectivity and increase in CO2 selectivity were observed, and the BD yield declined to 13.7 %. Meanwhile, although the ε-Fe2O3(50)-SiO2 catalyst showed lower 1-C4H8 conversions and lower BD yield than pure ε-Fe2O3 until 30 min, after 60 min, the BD yield increased to about 18.0 % over 4 h. In the ODH with the ε-Fe2O3(20)-SiO2 catalyst, the CO2 selectivity of about 14 % was lower than that of ε-Fe2O3(50)-SiO2. In addition, the high BD yield of ca.18 % was obtained, and the ODH activity of the ε-Fe2O3(20)-SiO2 catalyst was maintained during the reaction for 4 h, similar to the ε-Fe2O3(50)-SiO2 catalyst. The ε-Fe2O3(10)-SiO2 catalyst showed the lowest CO2 selectivity of 11 % in this study. Low O2 conversion of about 60 % (data not shown in Fig. 9) and 1-C4H8 conversion of 22 % were exhibited, producing a lower BD yield of ca.14 % compared to the other ε-Fe2O3 containing SiO2 catalysts. However, the catalytic performance was the most stable for the ε-Fe2O3(10)-SiO2 catalyst. As shown in these results, all ε-Fe2O3 containing SiO2 exhibited high stability compared to pure ε-Fe2O3. Although the BD yield improved with increasing ε-Fe2O3 content, the BD yield plateaued over 20 wt% of ε-Fe2O3. In addition, the CO2 selectivity did not increase in the reaction with the catalyst containing ε-Fe2O3 over 20 wt%. Therefore, we determined that 20 wt% of ε-Fe2O3 was the best content percentage. Finally, cis- or trans-but-2-ene is also important as a raw material for producing BD by the ODH. When the ODH of cis-2-C4H8 with ε-Fe2O3(20)-SiO2 catalyst was carried out (Fig. 10 ), high ODH activity was obtained similar to the case of ODH of 1-C4H8. In addition, the ODH activity was again maintained for 4 h. These results indicated that cis-2-C4H8 can also be used as a new material for BD with the ε-Fe2O3(20)-SiO2 catalyst. We propose the ε-Fe2O3 catalyst containing SiO2 as a novel iron oxide catalyst that shows high catalytic performance for the ODH of n-butene. 4 Conclusions In this study, we investigated the effect of the crystalline structure of iron oxide catalyst on the ODH of 1-C4H8. The ε-Fe2O3 catalyst showed the highest ODH activity (BD yield of 17.1 %) among various iron oxide catalysts, and we therefore present it as a novel and excellent catalyst. Moreover, when ε-Fe2O3 containing SiO2 (ε-Fe2O3-SiO2) was used for this reaction, the catalyst showed high BD yield, and deactivation was not seen over 4 h. We found that SiO2 improved the maintenance of the crystalline structure and the redox property of lattice oxygen in ε-Fe2O3. The optimum ε-Fe2O3 content was 20 wt%, because a high BD yield of 18 % for 4 h was obtained. This catalyst could also be used for the ODH of cis-2-C4H8 with the same BD yield (17 %) and high stability as for 1-C4H8. This suggested that cis- and trans-2-C4H8 could be recycled, which means the substantial selectivity of BD is higher than those indicated in the Tables and Figures in this report.

        "dc:description": "We investigate the effect of the crystalline structure of iron oxide catalysts on oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of n-butene. ODH reactions of n-butene were carried out with a fixed-bed flow reactor at 450 °C under a but-1-ene (1-C4H8) or cis-but-2-ene (cis-2-C4H8)(mL/min)/O2(mL/min) flow ratio of 5/2.5. Of the various iron oxide-based catalysts (α-, β-, γ-, ε-Fe2O3, Fe3O4, ZnFe2O4), ε-Fe2O3 showed the highest ODH activity. To the best of our knowledge, ε-Fe2O3 has never been used for the ODH of n-butene. Moreover, the catalytic performance of ε-Fe2O3 was improved by adding SiO2, which is related to the maintenance of its structure and improves its redox property. A high BD selectivity of 65 % and BD yield of 18 % were then obtained for 4 h without deactivation. This catalyst can be applied to the ODH of cis-2-C4H8 and is proposed as the noble high catalytic performance catalyst for the ODH of n-butene.",
