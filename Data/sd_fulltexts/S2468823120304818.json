Graphical abstract γ-Valerolactone (GVL) as a sustainable platform compound could be converted to renewable fuels and chemicals, whereas directly converting GVL to target products remains still the challenge. In this work, we report an amorphous SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst with adjustable acidity, which presented an excellent selectivity of 97.5 % butene at GVL conversion of 99.5 %, and remained an outstanding stability for 50 h. Appropriate weak and strong acid sites were the key for the ring-opening of GVL. Lower acid sites facilitated the decarboxylation of pentenoic acid (PEA), while higher acid sites promoted the cracking of PEA. Besides, a two-stage integration system was developed for converting GVL to C5 + hydrocarbons via butene intermediate, giving a good yield of 57.6 % C5 + hydrocarbons via combining the SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst with nano-HZSM-5 together. Keywords γ-Valerolactone Butene Decarboxylation Oligomerization Gasoline fuel 1 Introduction Huge consumption of traditional non-renewable fossil fuels and the worsening of environmental problems have drawn much attention for catalytic converting renewable biomass resources to useful chemicals and liquid fuels nowadays [1]. Lignocellulose stemmed from agricultural and forestry wastes is the most abundant renewable organic carbon resource in nature, effective utilization of which reduces the dependence on fossil energy and CO2 emission obviously [2–7]. γ-Valerolactone (GVL) can be easily obtained from lignocellulosic biomass, which is identified as a promising, sustainable platform molecule for producing a wide range of important renewable fuels and chemicals [8,9], such as 1,4-pentanediol (1,4-PDO), 2-MTHF, gasoline, diesel, biomass nylon and so on [10–14]. Butene as a very important organic chemical raw material is widely used in energy and fuels, chemical processing and material synthesis. Butene is not only directly used in current engines as a gas fuel, but also can generate C8-C16 liquid alkene fuels through oligomerization, which are challenging targets that are assumed to increase in demand [13,15,16]. In addition, 1-butene and 2-butene are commonly used to produce high-value chemicals such as butanol, butadiene, epoxy butane, methyl ethyl ketone and butene copolymer and so on [17,18]. The main synthesis methods of butene include sulfuric acid extraction separation and adsorption, petroleum cracking C4 fraction, butanol dehydration, and resin synthesis methods [19–22]. However, the production of fossil based feedstocks has been seriously impacted because of the depletion of fossil energy. The catalyst has a significant impact on the performance of reaction, and great efforts have been made for the design and application of mesoporous catalysts with outstanding features to adhere to the tenants of green chemistry [23–30]. Among these catalysts, mesoporous amorphous aluminosilicate catalysts have attracted increasing attention from researchers due to their rich active sites, shape selectivity, stability, recyclability as well as no corrosion and pollution in the catalytic reaction process. For instance, Doustkhah et al. had merged periodic mesoporous organosilica (PMO) with mesoporous aluminosilica (Al/Si-PMO) for catalysis in oxidation [23]. Furthermore, mesoporous few-layer nanosheets exfoliated from layered silicate also showed excellent molecular recognition ability [24]. In addition, mesoporous amorphous aluminosilicate had been applied to the catalysis of biomass conversion [31–33]. Recently, GVL was found to be a good feedstock to synthesis butene [31]. Dumesic et al. [13,32] developed a new route for synthesizing transportation fuel from GVL via a two-step route with GVL converting to butene in the first step, and then to liquid alkenes in the second step. And a good yield of butene was obtained at higher temperature. In their following study, the thermochemistry and kinetics of γ-Valerolactone conversion were proposed over amorphous silica alumina, where ring opening of GVL, cyclization and decarboxylation of pentenoic acids (PEA) take place in parallel via a proton-mediated elementary step. Besides, Zhang et al. [33] reported the same conversion of GVL to butene over the SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst and analyzed the decarboxylation mechanism. GVL was converted firstly to pentenoic acids by ring opening, and then the products of butene and CO2 were obtained by the cracking of α-carbonyl carbon single bond of pentenoic acids. Although some efforts have been made on the synthesis of butene from biomass-derived GVL, some defects need to be resolved. There is still a big room for improving the selectivity and yield of butene. In addition, carbon deposition on the surface of SiO2-Al2O3 is easily formed at higher temperature, resulting rapid deactivation of the catalyst. Especially, the effects of acid sites and reaction mechanism on GVL converting to butene are still unclearly, and it needs to be further explored. Herein, a mesoporous amorphous SiO2-Al2O3 (ASA) catalyst with tuning acid sites was prepared for converting GVL to butene. The reaction conditions including temperature, pressure, space velocity (WHSV) and feedstock concentration were investigated in detail to optimize the catalytic performance. Besides, the detailed reaction mechanism on GVL ring-opening and PEA decarboxylation was investigated. Subsequently, the combination of ASA with nano-HZSM-5 in an integrated system was adopted to study GVL converting directly to gasoline. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The mesoporous amorphous SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst (ASA) was prepared by a sol-gel method. Typically, an appropriate amount of TEOS (29.8 g) was added to anhydrous ethanol (120 mL) dropwise under stirring at room temperature to obtain a uniform mixed clear solution. After stirring for 15 min, a prepared certain concentration of acetic acid solution (0.2 mol/L) was added to the uniform mixed clear solution dropwise until the pH of 3.5, and then stirred for 60 min to obtain sol A. Meanwhile, an appropriate amount of Al(NO3)3⋅9H2O (13.5 g) was dissolved in deionized water (25 mL) to form a uniform salt solution. After stirring for 15 min, an aqueous solution of ammonia (25 %) was added to the uniform salt solution dropwise under stirring until the pH of 9.0, and then stirred at 60 °C for 15 min to obtain sol B. The sol A was added to sol B slowly under rapid stirring, then anhydrous ethanol (150 mL) was added to the mixed solution. After stirring at 60 °C for 2 h, an aqueous solution of ammonia (25 %) was added into the mixed solution dropwise under stirring until the pH of 9.0. After aging at room temperature for 24 h, the product was dried at 100 °C for 24 h and calcined in static air at 550 °C for 6 h. Finally, the amorphous SiO2-Al2O3 solid acid catalyst (Si/Al molar ratio of 4:1) was obtained, as named ASA-4:1. The SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst with other Si/Al ratio could be obtained by adjusting the content of TEOS and Al(NO3)3⋅9H2O, which is named ASA-x:y, where x:y is the Si/Al molar ratio. The nano-HZSM-5 zeolite was synthesized by a hydrothermal method. Briefly, a certain amount of TEOS was added to TPAOH aqueous solution, and stirred at 35 °C for 3 h. Then, deionized water and aluminum isopropanol were added to the former mixed solution, and the material molar composition was 30TEOS/ 1Al2O3: 8.1TPAOH/ 1110H2O. After being stirred for 10 h at room temperature, the alcohol produced by hydrolysis process of TEOS was removed by heating under vigorous stirring at 85 °C for 1 h. A quantity of water is added to maintain the volume, and then the mixed solution was put into a 100 mL crystallization kettle lined with polytetrafluoroethylene to crystallize at 170 °C for 3 days. The product was recovered by centrifugation, washed, and dried at 100 °C for 12 h. Then the nano-HZSM-5 zeolites were obtained after calcining in static air at 540 °C for 6 h. Finally, the sample was pressed and crushed to 40–60 mesh particles. 2.2 Catalyst characterizations and Catalytic tests The detailed information about catalyst characterizations and catalytic reaction tests were shown in the Supporting Information. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structural properties of ASA The morphology of the choosing ASA-4:1 was measured by SEM (Fig. 1 A). It can be seen that ASA-4:1 displays the morphology of irregular granular shape with average particles size about 50 nm. Fig. 1B shows a typical TEM image of ASA-4:1. It can be clearly observed that the catalyst was formed by the accumulation of flocs. Element mapping of Si, Al, and O in HAADF image confirmed the uniform distribution of various elements in the sample (Fig. 1C–F). Phase compositions of fresh ASA with different Si/Al molar ratios were characterized by PXRD (Fig. S2). It is found that a wide and large diffraction peak is appeared at 2θ = 23°, which is attributed to amorphous SiO2 phase [34]. And a weaker γ-Al2O3 diffraction peak is displayed at 2θ = 67° [35]. The decrease in the Si/Al ratio results in an increase of γ-Al2O3 diffraction peak, while a decrease of amorphous SiO2 diffraction peak. Textural properties of the corresponding catalysts were shown in Fig. 2 A,B and Table 1 . All the catalysts exhibit type IV isotherms with hysteresis loop in the range of 0.5–1.0 of P/P0, demonstrating the mesoporous feature created by the accumulation of nanoparticles. From the mesoporous pore-size distribution of BJH adsorption isotherms (Fig. 2B), it can be seen that the mesoporous pore size of the samples increases first and then decreases with the decrease of Si/Al ratio. Among them, ASA-8:1 sample shows less obvious mesoporosity, which indicates that higher Si/Al ratio in this synthesis method is not conducive to the formation of mesopore. In addition, the actual Si/Al ratio of the synthesized samples was calculated by X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy, which is almost the same as that of the feed ratio (Table 1), indicating the accuracy of the synthesis method. From Table 1 it can also be found that both the BET surface area and pore volume of ASA present a decreasing trend with the decrease in the Si/Al ratio. The BET surface area and pore volume of the SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst with Si/Al ratio of 8:1 (ASA-8:1) are 500.2 m2 g−1 and 1.14 m3 g−1, respectively, which decrease gradually to 375.3 m2 g-1 and 0.59 m3 g−1 of ASA-1:4, indicating that incorporation of more Al2O3 in ASA leads to the aggregation of nanoparticles, thus reducing the BET surface and pore volume. Especially, pore diameter increases first and then begins to decrease with the decrease in Si/Al ratio. A maximum value of pore diameter (15.1 nm) is displayed over ASA-4:1, suggesting that the Si/Al ratio of 4:1 in the SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst is the optimized value for promoting the mass transfer and diffusion of reactants and products. In addition, the acidity of ASA with different Si/Al ratios was further characterized by NH3-TPD (Fig. 2C). There are two main desorption peaks appeared around 300 and 450 °C, corresponding to the weak and strong acid sites, respectively. Obviously, the intensity of both the weak and strong acid sites presents an increasing trend with the decrease in the Si/Al ratio, implying that the increase of Al species amount in the SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst promotes the formation of weak and strong acid sites. The calculated value listed in Table 1 shows that the amount of total acid sites increase from 19.2 μmol g−1 of ASA-8:1 to 89.0 μmol g−1 of ASA-1:4. More importantly, both the weak and strong acid sites present an increasing trend with the increase of Al species. All of these results demonstrate that the changing of Si/Al ratio in ASA can tune efficiently both the weak and strong acid sites. FT-IR spectra of ASA samples with different Si/Al molar ratios was measured to study the framework structure and acid feature of the catalyst (Fig. 2D). According to the absorption spectrum, a strong absorption peak was observed at 3460 cm−1, which is corresponding to the antisymmetric stretching vibration of hydroxyl group on the surface of ASA [35]. The hydroxyl group is an important source of surface acidity of solid acid, which has no obvious change regardless of the Si/Al molar ratio. The peak at 1640 cm−1 is assigned to rotational vibration of HOH on the physically adsorbed water. And the absorption peak located at 1090 cm−1 and 800 cm−1 are assigned to the antisymmetric stretching vibration and symmetric stretching vibration of SiOSi, respectively. In addition, the bending vibration absorption peak of the ring SiOSi bond at 460 cm− 1 shows that the silicon oxygen bond of aluminosilicate is mainly cyclic SiOSi bond [35]. Obviously, the vibration intensity of Si-O-Si bond decreases with the increase of Al content. The absorption peak at 970 cm−1 is caused by SiOH symmetric stretching vibration, which is a basis for judging the homogeneity of SiO2-Al2O3 composite xerogels [35]. It can be seen from the spectrum that the peak strength at 970 cm−1 decreases with the increase of aluminum content, indicating that the SiOAl bond increases gradually. Especially when the molar ratio of Si to Al is less than 4:4, the peak at this position disappears completely, suggesting that the composite oxide is composed entirely of Si-O-Al bond. 3.2 Catalytic performance of GVL converting to butene over ASA The catalytic performance of GVL converting to butene over the SiO2-Al2O3 catalysts with different Si/Al ratios was shown in Fig. 3 . GVL conversion of 90.6 % is displayed over the SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst with Si/Al = 8:1, which increases to 99.5 % as the Si/Al ratio decreases to 4:1 (Fig. 3A). With continual decrease in the Si/Al ratio, GVL conversion begins to decrease slightly. A similar changing trend is observed for the butene yield. GVL conversion and butene yield reach the maximum value as the Si/Al ratio is adjusted to 4:1, suggesting that appropriate acid sites over the SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst have a positive role in improving the ring-opening of GVL. In addition, an optimized pore diameter is obtained as the Si/Al ratio is 4:1, which is in favor of the diffusion of reactants and products, improving the conversion of GVL. Besides, the selectivity to target butene presents a decreasing trend with the decrease of the Si/Al ratio (Fig. 3A). ASA-8:1 exhibits 99.1 % selectivity to butene, which decreases gradually to 91.5 % as the Si/Al ratio decreases to 1:4. This phenomenon implies that the decrease in acid sites facilitate the formation of target butene. It is possible that higher acid sites in the SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst lead to the cracking of PEA to acetic acid and propylene, decreasing the selectivity to butene [36]. The target butene has different types of isomers such as 2-butenes (trans-, cis-) and 1-butenes (n-, iso-), as shown in Table S1. The amount of 2-butenes and 1-butenes over ASA-8:1 is 75.2 and 24.8 %, respectively, indicating that the reaction of GVL converting to butene results mainly in the formation of 2-butenes. This result is different compared with that of Bond et al. [36], which obtained the dominant product of 1-butene at higher WHSV. They considered that decarboxylation of intermediate pentenoic acid bearing β-carbenium ions results in the production of 1-butene. It is possible that 1-butene isomerization takes place over acid sites, promoting the formation of 2-butenes (trans-, cis-) after decarboxylation, especially under conditions of higher yield of butene [13]. It can be found from Table S1 that the changing of Si/Al ratio has a negligible effect on the distribution of butene isomers. Except for butene isomers, some by-products are formed, including acetic acid, cyclopentanone, cyclopentenone and pentenoic acid (PEA), as shown in Fig. 3B. PEA is an intermediate which is produced by the ring-opening reaction of GVL. Cyclopentanone and cyclopentenone are produced by the dehydration and cyclization of PEA in the presence of acid sites [31]. Due to small activation barriers for GVL ring-opening and PEA ring-closure, the interconversion between GVL and PEA reaches a rapid equilibrium state [31]. The by-product of acetic acid comes from cracking of PEA. It is apparent that the amount of cyclopentanone and cyclopentenone are lower in a lower Si/Al ratio over ASA, indicating that higher acid sites are not conductive to the ring-closure of PEA, decreasing the amount of cyclopentanone and cyclopentenone. In addition, an increasing trend is observed for the selectivity to acetic acid with the decrease in the Si/Al ratio, suggesting that higher acid sites facilitate the cracking of PEA, and promoting the formation of cracked by-product of acetic acid. 3.3 Effect of reaction conditions 3.3.1 Reaction temperature The effect of reaction temperature on the catalytic performance of GVL converting to butene was shown in Fig. 4 . The resulting catalyst exhibits a low GVL conversion of 65.2 % at temperature of 300 °C, which increases gradually with the increase of reaction temperature and reaches the maximum value of 99.5 % at 375 °C. Subsequently, the GVL conversion begins to decrease. Synchronously, a similar changing trend is displayed for the yield of butene, indicating that at higher reaction temperature can overcome the activation energy and facilitates the conversion of GVL. While much higher temperature (over 375 °C) produces excessive energy, which results easily to coke formation on the catalyst, decreasing the catalytic activity [13]. In comparison, a slight decrease in the selectivity to butene is observed, which decreases slowly from 99.1 % at 300 °C to 95.7 % at 400 °C, confirming that higher temperature leads to the cracking of PEA [33]. From the production distribution of butene isomers shown in Table S2, the amount of 2-butenes (trans-, cis-) decrease gradually whereas that of 1-butenes (n-, iso-) display a slightly increasing trend with the increasing temperature, implying that higher temperature play a critical role in restraining 1-butenes isomerization. It can be seen that the PEA selectivity displays a decreasing trend with increasing temperature, while the selectivity to cyclopentanone and cyclopentenone increases gradually (Fig. 4B), suggesting that higher temperature is conducive to the ring-closure of PEA. As reaction temperature exceeds over 375 °C, both the cyclopentanone and cyclopentenone decrease slightly in the concentration, which may be attributed to carbon deposition formed on the surface of the catalyst, suppressing the catalytic activity of PEA ring-closure. Especially, the selectivity to acetic acid presents an increasing trend with the increase in reaction temperature, confirming the enhanced cracking of PEA in higher temperature. 3.3.2 Reaction pressure The effect of pressure on the catalytic performance was presented in Fig. 5 . The pressure has little impact on the GVL conversion, which remains stable (about 99 %) in the range of 0.1–6.0 MPa (Fig. 5A). The butene selectivity and yield increase first and then begin to decrease, a maximum value of butene selectivity and yield is presented at 4.0 MPa. It is possible that higher pressure decreases the rate of decarboxylation of intermediate PEA, suppressing the formation of target butene. The results of butene isomers shown in Table S3 indicate that the amount of 2-butenes (trans-, cis-) display a decreasing trend whereas that of 1-butenes (n-, iso-) increase gradually with increasing pressure, implying that lower pressure is in favor of the isomerization of 1-butenes. In addition, with the increase of system pressure, a corresponding increase in the PEA selectivity is observed as shown in Fig. 5B. Synchronously, a decrease in the selectivity to cyclopentanone and cyclopentenone is observed. Combined with the decrease of butene selectivity with increasing pressure, it is considered that elevated pressure is not conductive to further conversion of intermediate PEA. Besides, the selectivity of acetic acid increases gradually with the increase of pressure, indicating that higher pressure can cause the cracking of PEA. 3.3.3 Different WHSV of GVL Fig. 6 presented the effect of WHSV on the catalytic performance of GVL converting to butene. The conversion of GVL remains unchanged basically, while the selectivity of butene decreases slightly from 97.5 to 94.0 % in the range of 0.18 to 0.90 h−1 (Fig. 6) which indicates that the change of WHSV has little impact on the ring-opening of GVL and decarboxylation of PEA. In addition, the variation of WHSV has no obvious effect on the distribution of butene isomers (Table S4), suggesting that the isomerization of butene is fast enough to reach equilibrium quickly. From the results of by-products shown in Fig. 6B, the selectivity of PEA remains unchanged with the changing WHSV, further confirming litter influence of WHSV on the decarboxylation of PEA. In addition, a slight increase in the acetic acid selectivity and decrease in the selectivity of cyclopentanone and cyclopentenone are displayed with the increase of WHSV from 0.18 to 0.90 h−1, demonstrating that the PEA cracking and PEA ring-closure take place slight change due to the changing of retention time of intermediates in the reactor. 3.3.4 Different concentration of GVL The effect of different GVL concentrations on the catalytic performance was shown in Fig. 7 . When used 100 % GVL pure raw reactant, synthesizing butene via GVL ring-opening and decarboxylation processes has suffered serious deactivation (Fig. 7A). The GVL conversion and butene selectivity present a distinctly decreasing trend with time on stream, which may attribute to carbon deposition produced on the catalyst without adding water, resulting in the easy deactivation and poor catalytic performance in the GVL converting to butene reaction. As water is added into GVL aqueous solution, the GVL conversion and butene selectivity improve obviously. 80 % GVL aqueous solution modifies the catalytic performance of ASA to some extent compared with 100 % GVL pure raw reactant. As the concentration of GVL decreases from 80 to 60 %, the SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst displays excellent stability with time on stream. Both GVL conversion and the butene selectivity remain 99.5 % and 97.5 %, respectively, which remain excellent stable state within 50 h on stream, implying that the presence of proper amount of water is beneficial to the conversion of GVL to butene. When the concentration of GVL is further reduced to 30 %, although GVL conversion is comparative, butene selectivity decreases obviously to 77 %, indicating that excessive water is not conducive to the formation of butene. It is possible that adding excessive water is adsorbed on the acid sites and inhibits the acid-catalyzed surface reaction, decreasing the selectivity to target butene [37]. In addition, from the results of butene isomers shown in Fig. S3, the concentration variation of GVL has obvious effect on the distribution of butene isomers. With the decrease of water content in raw reactant, the increasing trend of 1-butene and the decreasing trend of 2-butene (trans-, cis-) are more obvious, suggesting that the reduction of water makes the SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst more prone to carbon deposition, which results in the reduction of acid active sites of the catalyst, inhibiting the isomerization of butene. The results of Bond et al. [13] indicated that the less stable 1-butene is easily isomerized to form the more stable trans-2-butene, cis-2-butene and isobutene in the presence of acid sites. Thus, suitable adding of water facilitates the isomerization of butene, whereas excessive adding of water may compete to adsorb on the acid sites, suppressing the butene isomerization reaction, decreasing the amount of 2-buenes. Based on above results, the optimized conditions of Si/Al = 4:1, 375 °C, 4.0 MPa, 0.18 h−1 and concentration of GVL = 60 % were chosen for further investigation. The distribution of by-products was shown in Fig. 7B. It is found that with reaction time on stream, the amount of PEA increase gradually, indicating that the decarboxylation of PEA is rapid reaction, which may be restrained slightly with the formation of carbon deposition on the catalyst via prolonging the reaction time. Besides, the selectivity to acetic acid presents a decreasing trend with time on stream, which may be attributed to carbon deposition produced on the catalyst with time, suppressing the PEA cracking reaction. The coke deposition is measured by the TG curves for spent catalysts corresponding to different concentrations of GVL after 50 h (Fig. 7C). The weight loss below 300 °C and that above 300 °C are attributed to the adsorbed water and deposited carbon, respectively. For fresh ASA-4:1, it shows a trend of slow weight loss throughout the temperature range, showing excellent thermal stability. The weight loss of ASA-30 % GVL is 10.9 %, which increases gradually to 30.2 % for ASA-100 % GVL, indicating that the increase of added water is beneficial to the inhibition of carbon deposition. 3.4 Reaction pathways According to the results mentioned above, a possible reaction scheme of converting GVL directly to butene was illustrated in Scheme 1 . The SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst has Brönsted and Lewis acid sites due to the multi-component rings such as Si-O-tetrahedron, Al-O-tetrahedron, six ring and disordered Si (Al) O- frame structure [38]. Because of the existence of carbonyl electron acceptor, γ-hydrogen in GVL molecule is very active, which is easy to be excited to generate carbon positive ion via protonation reaction, resulting in ring-opening of lactone to form γ-protonated PEA, an intermediate that has a carbenium ion (or its surface analog) in the γ-position (C4) and a carboxyl group. Subsequently, γ-protonated PEA can be converted to protonated analogs of PEA isomer via the H-shift steps [31], any of which may deprotonate to form one of the five stable, gas-phase isomers of PEA via unstable carbon positive ion. In particular, PEA isomers are easy to undergo re-protonation to form β-carbenium ion, due to the electronic effect of induction and conjugation. With the increase of the polarity of carbon oxygen double bond, CC bond cleavage between the α- and carbonyl carbons occurs on the acid sites, resulting in the formation of butene isomers and carbon dioxide by decarboxylation. It is likely that the preferred configuration for decarboxylation involves the location of the CC double bond in the 2- or 3-position, which could be protonated in α- or γ- position to form a secondary β-carbenium ion. This is consistent with the results of Bond et al. [31], which suggested that GVL is first converted to the PEA intermediate by ring-opening reaction, and then converted continually to butene by decarboxylation of PEA. The isomerization of 1-butene is easy to take place in the role of acid sites, leading to the formation of trans-2-butene, cis-2-butene and isobutene as secondary products. Due to the low activation barriers to ring-opening of GVL and ring-closure of PEA under the present conditions, by-products such as cyclopentanone and cyclopentenone can be obtained. Especially, with the increase of acid sites amount of ASA, PEA produced is further cracked to acetic acid via a sequence of proton-mediated elementary steps. 3.5 Butene converting to gasoline over nano-HZSM-5 After obtaining the optimized performance for GVL converting to butene, we further investigated the conversion of butene to gasoline in the second reactor. Nano-HZSM-5 was chosen to convert butene to C5 + hydrocarbons. The catalytic performance of nano-HZSM-5 under the conditions of 250 °C and 4.0 MPa was shown in Fig. 8 . It can be found that the initial activity of nano-HZSM-5 is 97.7 %, which presents a slightly decreasing trend with time on stream. After reaction for 50 h, the catalytic activity still remains 85.0 %, indicating that nano-HZSM-5 has the outstanding catalytic ability for converting butene to gasoline. The selectivity to C5 + hydrocarbons at the initial stage is 82.2 %, which increases gradually to 86.2 % after 50 h of reaction time, indicating that longer reaction time facilitates the formation of gasoline. Under these conditions, the total yield of C5 + hydrocarbons from GVL reaches 57.6 %, indicating that the integrated system of GVL ring-opening, PEA decarboxylation and butene oligomerization displays the excellent performance for obtaining gasoline from GVL. 4 Conclusions In summary, the amorphous SiO2-Al2O3 catalysts with different Si/Al ratios were prepared for GVL converting to butene. The changing of Si/Al ratio in the SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst tuned efficiently the weak and strong acid sties, which played a critical role in the reactions of GVL ring-opening and PEA decarboxylation. ASA-4:1 with appropriate acid sites facilitated the ring-opening of GVL. The decrease in acid sites promoted the PEA decarboxylation to butene, while higher acid sites enhanced the cracking of PEA. In higher yield of butene, 1-butene isomerization took place easily, resulting in the formation of trans-2-butene, cis-2-butene and isobutene. Under the optimized reaction conditions of Si/Al = 4:1, 375 °C, 4.0 MPa, 0.18 h−1 and concentration of GVL = 60 %, GVL conversion of 99.5 % with excellent selectivity of 97.5 % butene was obtained over ASA-4:1, which remained good stability for 50 h. In addition, combined of GVL converting to butene over ASA with butene oligomerization over nano-HZSM-5 in a integrate system, the total yield of C5 + hydrocarbons reached 57.6 %, suggesting that this two-stage strategy is a potential catalytic pathway to convert biomass platform compounds into high-quality liquid fuels.

        "dc:description": "γ-Valerolactone (GVL) as a sustainable platform compound could be converted to renewable fuels and chemicals, whereas directly converting GVL to target products remains still the challenge. In this work, we report an amorphous SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst with adjustable acidity, which presented an excellent selectivity of 97.5 % butene at GVL conversion of 99.5 %, and remained an outstanding stability for 50 h. Appropriate weak and strong acid sites were the key for the ring-opening of GVL. Lower acid sites facilitated the decarboxylation of pentenoic acid (PEA), while higher acid sites promoted the cracking of PEA. Besides, a two-stage integration system was developed for converting GVL to C5 + hydrocarbons via butene intermediate, giving a good yield of 57.6 % C5 + hydrocarbons via combining the SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst with nano-HZSM-5 together.",
