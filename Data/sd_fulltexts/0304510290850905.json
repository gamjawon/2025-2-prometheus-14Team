K. WOO, R. SRINIVASAN, L. RICE, R. J. DE ANGELIS and P. J. REUCROFT Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40506 (U.SA.) (Received May 11,1989; revised July 29,1989) Summary Five Ni/Co bimetallic catalysts with loadings of 10% Ni, 7% Ni + 3% Co, 5%Ni+5%Co, 3%Ni+7%Co, and 10% Co were impregnated on Degussa silica by the incipient wetness technique. The catalysts were calcined at 400 C for about 5h in a furnace, and then reduced at 350 C in flowing hydrogen for about 20 h. Lattice parameters determined from X-ray diffraction data indicated the presence of either pure Ni and pure Co or a bimetallic alloy. The activity of the reduced catalysts were determined by measuring the conversion of a 3:1 mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. As the Co content increased, the catalysts showed high initial activity and more rapid deactivation in methane and ethane formation. Stacking faults which can be directly observed in cobalt-rich catalysts may provide active sites which increase the initial activity and also cause rapid deactivation. The formation of NiO in the 7% Ni + 3% Co system may also be related to the high initial activity of this system. Ethylene formation also increased as the Co content of the catalysts increased. Introduction Since the discovery of catalytic hydrocarbon synthesis, pure metal catalyst systems have been extensively studied. Bimetallic catalysts sup- ported on high surface area carriers, such as alumina and silica, have attracted considerable attention recently because their performance in catalytic reactions differs significantly from that of the individual com- ponents [1, 2]. Bimetallic catalyst powders are usually made from metal carbonates or nitrates. The advantage of using these catalyst powders is that they have the very large surface area and roughness that are required for catalytic activity. Bimetallic catalysts are used extensively in reactions such as isomeriza- tion of alkanes, aromatization of alkyl-cyclopentanes, dehydrogenation of cyclohexanes to aromatic hydrocarbons, and hydrogenolysis of alkanes and cycloalkanes. The activities of a metal catalyst for different reactions can be 0304-5102/90/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 84 altered to a great extent by the incorporation of a second metallic element into the catalyst. For example, cyclohexane undergoes extensive hydroge- nolysis to low molecular weight alkanes, primarily methane, in addition to dehydrogenation to benzene, if a pure Ru catalyst is used. However, the incorporation of either Cu or Ag with Ru inhibits the hydrogenolysis reaction, with concomitant marked improvement in selectivity for benzene formation. A great deal of interest in bimetallic catalysts is due to this selectivity phenomenon [3]. The most complete data available to date are for metals of the third transition series, for which the hydrogenolysis activity reaches a maximum value with Os. From Os to Pt the activity decreases. A similar observation is made from Ru to Pd in the second transition series. However, the hydroge- nolysis activity increases from Fe and reaches a maximum with Ni. This difference is somewhat analogous to known chemical differences between elements of the first transition series and the corresponding elements of the second and third transition series [4]. In general, the inclusion of a Group IB metal with a Group VIII metal was found to decrease the hydrogenolysis activity of the latter, but has a much smaller effect on the activity for reactions such as dehydrogenation and isomerization of hydrocarbons [5-9]. A host of literature is available for Cu Ni, Ru Ir, Pt Ir and other bimetallic catalysts. However, insufficient work has been done on the bimetallic catalysts prepared from the Group VIII metals, such as Ni Co systems. This system is of interest because the stable crystal structure can be varied from hep to fee as the proportion of Ni increases [10]. The system thus provides a means to evaluate the effect of catalyst particle crystallography on the catalyst activity. Recent studies on the activity of Co through the hcp-fcc phase transition indicate that the crystal structure of the catalyst may have a significant effect on kinetics [11]. The effect of Ni addition on the tempera- ture of the hep Co<- fcc Co transformation [12-14] showed that the hysteresis of the diffusionless transformation increases with the Ni content. Yamamoto [15, 16] concluded, from measurements of density and various magnetic properties, that at low temperatures alloys with 22 32% Ni consist of a mixture of hep and fee. Also Lihl [17], by reducing Ni Co formate solid solutions at 350 C, found the two-phase region to extend from 17-32% Ni. At 400 C, 5 wt.% in Co stabilizes the fee phase, while 30 wt.% Ni is required at room temperature [18]. Since the hcp<- fcc transformation is in general not complete, a two-phase structure in these alloys usually does not represent the equilibrium conditions [19]. A study has been carried out on the hydrogenation of ethylene with bimetallic catalysts consisting of varying amounts of Co and Ni supported on Degussa silica [20]. Both pure Co and pure Ni yield high activity in the selective hydrogenation of ethylene. Evidence was presented that the activity increases stepwise with 30 and 90% Ni bimetallic catalysts. In this composi- tion range the crystal structure is fee [20]. The activity of pure Ni(fcc) was approximately three times greater than that of pure Co(hcp). 85 The present paper describes an investigation on the effect of varying the Ni/Co bimetallic catalyst composition on carbon monoxide hydrogenation activity. Structural information provided by X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy is employed to correlate and interpret the results. Experimental procedures Bimetallic catalysts containing 10% Ni, 7% Ni + 3% Co, 5% Ni + 5% Co, 3% Ni + 7% Co and 10% Co (by weight) were prepared by co-impregnating metallic nitrate solutions onto Degussa silica (Aerosol 200) with surface area of about 200 m2 g~1 [21]. The nitrate salts used for co-impregnation were Ni and Co nitrates (ACS grade), both supplied by Fisher Scientific. After co-impregnation the catalysts were dried in an oven at 120 C overnight. Specimens for structural studies were prepared by packing the catalyst powders in a stainless steel holder and mounting it on a small furnace. The samples were calcined at 400 C for 5 h, reduced at 350 C for about 20 h and passivated in a 98% Na-2% Og mixture for about 24 h in the furnace. The passivated catalysts were then analyzed in a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer with a Cu target tube operated at 40 kV and 20 mA and a 1/2 divergent slit. Data were collected at 1/100 of a degree step, with a counting time of 40 per step. The reduction temperature of 350 C was selected because pure hep Co transforms to fee Co at 417 C. The activity study was carried out on separately prepared samples. 0.1 g of catalyst powder was charged to the reactor and reduced at 400 C in flowing hydrogen for 18 h. A 3:1 mixture of Hg and CO was then passed through the catalyst bed at a flow rate of 50 cm3 min~1 at 400 C. The effluent was analyzed for hydrocabon products at hourly intervals using a Perkin- Elmer (Model #8500) gas chromatograph. To achieve gradientless reactor operation, an all-glass continuously-stirred tank reactor of cross-sectional area 50 cm2 was used. A schematic diagram of the reactor is shown in Fig. 1. Carbon monoxide conversion levels were limited to less than 1% in order to maintain isothermal conditions. The reactivity was expressed as a turnover number, the number of molecules of hydrocarbon produced per active metal site per second. The number of active metal sites and the metal particle surface area were determined using a hydrogen chemisorption technique. The samples were evacuated first and then heated to 400 C in steps of 50 C. At 400 C, the samples were then reduced for 18 h under flowing hydrogen. After reduction, the samples were evacuated and the hydrogen chemisorption capacity at monolayer coverage (Nm) was determined at room temperature from chemi- sorption isotherms that were obtained employing a PMI Automated Sorp- tometer manufactured by Porous Materials, Inc., NY. The monolayer capacity was determined by extrapolating the saturation region of the isotherm to zero pressure [22, 23]. 86 Gas Inlet i i Gas Outlet Viton-0-Ring Thermowell Baffles Fig. 1. A schematic diagram of the reactor. A Philips EM400T analytical electron microscope, equipped with a field emission gun, a 6585 STEM unit and an EDAX 9100/70 system, was employed to observe the passivated bimetallic catalyst particles. Results The X-ray diffraction patterns of the reduced catalysts containing 10% Co and 10% Ni are shown in Figs. 2 and 3 respectively. The X-ray pattern from the 10% Co contains the (100), (002), (101) and (110) reflections from the hep Co (see Fig. 2). The Co(lll)fcc and Co(002)hcp profiles overlap, making it difficult to detect the presence of fee Co. However the existence of fee Co was established by the observation of the (200)ccc profile at 20 = 51.402 , which is not overlapped by any hep profiles. Calculations made using the integrated intensity of the (200)fcc profile indicated about 27% of fee phase to be present.

The X-ray diffraction patterns of the 5% Ni + 5% Co and 3% Ni + 7% Co catalysts are shown in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively. Lattice parameters calculated from these data are shown in Fig. 6. These data strongly suggest that alloy formation occurred during processing.

Cobalt is known to form stacking faults easily, and these faults cause selective broadening of X-ray diffraction peaks [25]. High concentrations of growth faults in Co were observed in earlier studies. Typical images of stacking faults are shown for alloy catalysts in Figs. 9 and 10. The average fault spacing was deduced to be approximately 6 planes (fault probability, ft = 0.16) [26]. The presence of about 27% fee phase in the sample containing 10% Co and no Ni is consistent with very high fault density.

The pure Ni catalyst has almost three times more active sites than the pure Co catalyst, whereas the bimetallic catalysts have similar values ofN^ between the pure metal catalysts. From the results in Fig. 8, it can be suggested that the active sites increase as the fee phase increases. The hydrogen chemisorp- tion data were used to calculate the turnover numbers from the activity studies.

Methane and ethane turnover numbers as a function of time for these catalysts are shown in Figs. 11 and 12 respectively. The highest initial activity for both methane and ethane formation was observed with the cobalt-rich catalyst, i.e. the 10% Co and 3% Ni+7% Co systems. These catalysts were rapidly deactivated, however, and at longer times (>20 h reaction time) the highest activity was observed with the nickel-rich catalysts.

Discussion The present investigation was carried out to observe the effect of Co/Ni alloy formation on the activity of the catalysts. It is well known that Ni exists in the fee form, while the two allotropic forms of Co are fee and hep. Hep Co transforms to the fee form at about 415 C and this is well documented in the literature [19, 25]. The significant feature of this transformation is that stacking faults are generated in the atomic sequence [25], and that these faults may act as active sites in catalytic reactions [27, 28]. The density of stacking faults of Co catalysts on silica supports was found to be greater than that of Co catalysts on ZSM-5 supports [26, 27]. These studies shed light on the effect of the support on the density of stacking faults. In the present study, the growth fault probability (j8) of about 0.16 was calculated for the 10% Co catalyst from the fault-affected (lOl)hcp profile and fault-independent (llO)hcp profile. The average number of planes between faults was about 6, which is in agreement with a previous study [26]. However, for other catalysts, the fault-affected (lOl)hcp profile is extremely broad, making the calculation of growth fault probability (p) very 94 difficult. Consequently the large breadth of the (lOl)hcp profile indicates a very high density of stacking faults. A close observation of this fault-affected (lOl)hcp Co profile shows that the profile gradually diminishes in intensity, simultaneously increasing the amount of fee phase with increasing Ni content. An attempt to transform the fee phase to hep form by cooling in liquid nitrogen failed to produce a change in the diffraction pattern. This may be due to the phase transition temperature being below liquid nitrogen temperature, or there may be fee particles of very high Ni content [10]. The plot of lattice parameter vs. Co content of loading (Fig. 6) presents evidence that the 7% Ni + 3% Co, 5% Ni + 5% Co and 3% Ni + 7% Co catalysts form alloys, as the lattice parameters calculated for these samples from their X-ray diffraction profiles fall between the lattice parameters of pure Ni and pure Co. It can also be seen from the X-ray diffraction patterns that the unique Co(100)hcp profile decreases in intensity with decreasing Co content, and ultimately vanishes for the 7% Ni+3% Co sample. This also provides evidence for the alloy formation following Vergard's law [29]. The present trend in lattice parameter is generally in good agreement with previous studies [30], although the corresponding values are somewhat different, probably because the catalyst powders are of extremely small particle diameter. The X-ray diffraction pattern obtained from the 7% Ni + 3% Co catalyst is somewhat unique. There is strong evidence for metal oxides in addition to the existence of metallic alloys. As all the profiles of NiO and CoO and those of Ni(fcc) and Co(fcc) overlap, the respective positions of these peaks are indicated in Fig. 7. It is noteworthy that the amount of unreduced oxide in this catalyst is more than the others. The high activity in methane formation for this catalyst in the first 10 h of reaction time (Fig. 11) may be attributed to the existence of ultrafine metal oxide particles in addition to the presence of fee Ni or Co. However, the long-lasting activity appears to be related to the increasing proportion of fee phase (Fig. 8). Although the 10% Co and 3% Ni + 7% Co samples exhibit highest initial activity for the formation of both methane and ethane, the rate of deactivation for these catalysts is very rapid, probably owing to carbon deposition on the surface atoms. Stacking faults in the catalyst particles may be providing initial catalytic activity but these active sites become rapidly covered with carbon in the case of the cobalt-rich catalysts, and deactivation results. It is well known that carbide formation aids catalyst deactivation [31]. The rate of deactivation for the nickel-rich catalysts decreases more slowly with reaction time. Ethylene formation was not observed in the case of the 10% Ni and 7% Ni + 3% Co catalysts. However, it was observed in the 5% Ni + 5% Co catalyst after 24 h reaction time. The formation of ethylene then generally increased with increasing Co. In the case of the pure Co catalyst, ethylene appeared at all reaction times at a level comparable to that of ethane. The formation of ethylene apparently requires the presence of Co and also needs a longer incubation time. 95 Acknowledgements This research was sponsored by the U.S. Dept. of Energy (Grant No. DE-FG05-85ER45186 and the SHaRE program at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (Contract No. DE-AC05-760R00033).

Rice R.J. De Angelis P.J. Reucroft Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40506 U.S.A. Five Ni/Co bimetallic catalysts with loadings of 10% Ni, 7% Ni + 3% Co, 5% Ni+5% Co, 3% Ni+7% Co, and 10% Co were impregnated on Degussa silica by the incipient wetness technique. The catalysts were calcined at 400 °C for about 5 h in a furnace, and then reduced at 350 °C in flowing hydrogen for about 20 h. Lattice parameters determined from X-ray diffraction data indicated the presence of either pure Ni and pure Co or a bimetallic alloy. The activity of the reduced catalysts were determined by measuring the conversion of a 3:1 mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. As the Co content increased, the catalysts showed high initial activity and more rapid deactivation in methane and ethane formation. Stacking faults which can be directly observed in cobalt-rich catalysts may provide active sites which increase the initial activity and also cause rapid deactivation. The formation of NiO in the 7% Ni + 3% Co system may also be related to the high initial activity of this system. Ethylene formation also increased as the Co content of the catalysts increased.
