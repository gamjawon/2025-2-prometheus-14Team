Graphical abstract Hierarchical hollow bimetallic NiCo/MgxNiyO catalysts were constructed by assembling NiMgCo layered double hydroxide (LDH) platelets on zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67), followed by subsequent calcination and reduction. The three-level hierarchical structure of NiCo/MgxNiyO catalysts, including the hollow structure, nanolamellar structure and NiCo alloy particles, showed a significant enhancement on the catalytic activity of NiCo/MgxNiyO in the hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanol. The confined environment of the lamellar structure may strengthen the interaction between the active species and support, avoiding the agglomeration, sintering and leaching of the NiCo active species, thus facilitating the stability. The optimal catalyst NiCo/MgxNiyO(10) showed an excellent catalytic performance with 99.9 % conversion and 99.9 % selectivity for cyclohexanol, and featured with a highest TOF value of 588 h−1 compared with the reported Ni-based catalysts. Detailed characterizations have demonstrated that the combination of the hollow structure and the confined effect would benefit the catalytic performance. Moreover, this non-precious metal catalyst can be magnetically separated, and recycled for at least 6 times. This approach provides a valuable guidance for the design and preparation of the non-precious metal catalysts for industrial applications. Keywords Phenol hydrogenation ZIF-67 Layered double hydroxide NiCo bimetallic catalyst Confinement effect 1 Introduction Selective hydrogenation of phenol is one of the important commercial reactions to produce the feedstocks for the manufacture of adipic acid, caprolactam and nylon in petroleum industrial chemistry. Although precious metal catalysts, such as Pt, Pd, and Ru, have been developed as the promising catalysts in this transformation, [1–8] the high cost and limited natural resource have therefore limited their large-scale applications in industry. Non-precious metal catalysts have been studied as substitutes for precious metal catalysts in a number of hydrogenation reactions, due to their low cost and wide availability [9–14]. However, these catalysts are prone to aggregation due to their high surface energy. Simultaneously, metal leaching and carbon deposition also lead to their rapid deactivation under harsh reaction conditions [15,16]. Moreover, the large amount of deactivated catalysts is environmentally hazardous materials due to the heavy metals and volatile organic compounds. Particularly, the disposal of these deactivated catalysts requires complicated processes with the expense of massive energy, chemicals and water consumption, which may cause secondary environmental pollution. Therefore, stability improvement is crucial to the economic and environmental sustainability. A number of strategies for stabilizing metal nanoparticles (NPs), such as the use of strong interaction between the metal and the support, encapsulating or fixing metal NPs within a shell, and localizing metal NPs in a confined space, have been developed. [17–22] Nowadays, catalysts derived from layered double hydroxides (LDHs) often possess high stability due to the confinement effect [23,24]. The catalyst precursor was well-dispersed in the lamellar structure of LDHs, and subsequently metallic NPs can be in-situ generated and implanted in the mixed metal oxides, [25,26] which suppressed the formation of large metallic NPs. These LDHs-derived catalysts can maintain their original structure even after high-temperature processing [27,28]. More importantly, the metallic NPs in the LDHs-derived catalyst can be in situ produced through a timesaving process, avoiding tedious preparation process. However, the monotonous lamellar structure of LDHs may lower the specific surface area and suppress the mass transfer process, thus limiting their activity improvement in heterogeneous catalysis. Previous studies have demonstrated that hierarchically structured catalysts possessed certain unique features, such as high specific surface area, low mass transfer resistance, good catalytic activity and mechanical stability due to their macro-, meso-, and micro- porous structures. [29–32] Notably, metal organic frameworks (MOFs), such as ZIF-67 [33–35], and ZIF-8 [36,37], can be served as versatile template to further construct three-dimensional (3D) layered structures due to their well-defined morphology, highly ordered crystal structure, permanent porosity and high chemical and thermal stability. Furthermore, the intrinsic metal ions in MOFs can act as the precursor of the active species in the prepared catalysts for related reactions [38–40].However, expanding the application scope of such kind of hierarchical 3D LDHs, together with the activity improvement of the LDHs-derived catalysts, is still a challenging task. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report on the LDHs and MOF dual-derived hierarchically structured catalyst for heterogeneous catalysis. The objective of this study is to develop a highly active, stable, and magnetically recyclable NiCo alloy catalyst for phenol hydrogenation. Hollow NiCo/MgxNiyO catalysts were prepared by the in-situ formation of lamellar structured NiMgCo-LDH on ZIF-67 nanocrystals via a solvent-thermal method. Notably, ZIF-67 exhibited dual functionalities: the self-sacrificing template and the Co(II) source. It was found that the combination of hierarchical structure and the confinement effect can effectively improve the catalytic performance of the prepared NiCo/MgxNiyO catalysts in phenol hydrogenation. Comprehensive characterizations are also performed in order to clarify the structure-property relationships of the catalysts. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Chemicals and materials Nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate [Ni(NO3)2·6H2O] and magnesium(II) nitrate hexahydrate [Mg(NO3)2·6H2O] were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Cobalt nitrate (II) hexahydrate [Co(NO3)2·6H2O] was purchased from Tianjin Kemiou Chemical Reagent Factory, and 2-methylimidazole was purchased from J&K Scientific Ltd. 2.2 Synthesis of ZIF-67 nanocrystals The ZIF-67 nanocrystals with dodecahedron structure were synthesized using a previously reported method. [41–43] In brief, Co(NO3)2·6H2O (12.45 g) and 2-methylimidazole (16.40 g) were dissolved in 200 mL of methanol, respectively. The clear cobaltous solution was then poured into the 2-methylimidazole solution and stirred for 1 h. The mixture solution was allowed to age at room temperature for 12 h. Afterwards, a purple solid was collected by filtration, washed by methanol, and dried at 65 °C for 12 h. 2.3 Catalysts preparation 2.3.1 Hollow NiCo/MgxNiyO(x) To a round-bottom flask containing ZIF-67 (0.5 g), Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (5 mmol), different amounts of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (0, 5, 10, and 15 mmol) and ethanol (120 mL) were added and refluxed at 90 °C under vigorous stirring for 1 h. The precursors were collected by centrifugation, washed by ethanol, and dried at 65 °C for 12 h, and classified as NiMgCo-LDH(x), where “x” denoted as the amount of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O. The as-prepared precursors were heated in a muffle furnace to 600 °C with a heating rate of 1.5 °C min−1, and hold for 2 h to obtain layered double oxides (LDO), denoted as NiMgCo-LDO(x). Finally, these precursors were reduced at 500 °C under a H2 flow for 2 h to afford the final catalysts, classified as NiCo/MgxNiyO(x) (See Scheme 1 ). 2.3.2 Reference catalyst The reference catalyst was prepared by an impregnation method. Typically, ZIF-67 (0.5 g), Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (10 mmol) and ethanol (120 mL) were mixed and refluxed at 90 °C for 1 h. The resulting catalyst support was collected by centrifugation, washed by ethanol, and dried at 65 °C for 12 h. Subsequently, this support was impregnated with a mixed solution of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (5 mmol) and 1.5 mL of H2O under ultrasound for 0.5 h. The resulting paste was dried at 65 °C for 12 h to obtain the catalyst precursor. The following calcination/reduction procedures were the same as those of NiMgCo-LDO(10). The calcined precursor and the final prepared catalyst were denoted as NiMgCo-LDO-imp(10) and NiCo/MgxNiyO-imp(10), respectively. 2.4 Characterization X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was measured using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer equipped with a CuKα radiation source, at a scanning speed of 0.1 s/step in an angle range of 5-80°. The contents of Ni, Mg and Co were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) using a Varian Vista MPX spectrometer. The Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) surface area was estimated using a Micromeritics Tristar II 3020 surface area and porosity analyzer. The H2-chemisorption, hydrogen-temperature programmed desorption (H2-TPD) and hydrogen-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) were determined using a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 chemisorber equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. The surface morphology of each sample was observed using a JEOL JSM-7500 scanning electron microscope (SEM). The transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were obtained using a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed on a PHI 1600 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The binding energy (BE) was corrected at a C1s peak of 284.8 eV. 2.5 Catalytic tests In a typical run, phenol (1.2 g), catalyst (0.1 g) and n-hexane (60 mL) were mixed in a WZB-100 stainless steel autoclave equipped with a magnetically-driven stirrer and electric heating system. The residual air was expelled by filling/evacuating with hydrogen (1.0 MPa) five times. The reaction system was then pressurized with hydrogen to 2 MPa, heated to 150 °C, and subsequently stirred for 2.5 h. After cooled to room temperature, the residual hydrogen was evacuated, and the catalyst was magnetically separated. The obtained products were analyzed by gas chromatograph (Agilent 7820A) and identified by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (Thermo Fisher Trace 1300 GC, ISQ MS). 3 Results and discussion A series of NiCo/MgxNiyO(x) catalysts was prepared and tested in the hydrogenation of phenol, and the results are summarized in Table 1 . The NiCo/NixO(0) catalyst without magnesium shows a low activity (2.8 % conversion) and selectivity (89.6 %, entry 1). In the case of low Mg content (entry 2), the conversion of phenol and the selectivity for cyclohexanol were significantly increased to 80.4 % and 96.5 %, respectively. Notably, the NiCo/MgxNiyO(10) exhibited the highest activity (99.9 %) and selectivity for cyclohexanol (99.9 %) in phenol hydrogenation (entry 3). In contrast, with further increasing the Mg content (entry 4), both conversion and selectivity were decreased, indicating that the Mg content has a significant effect on the activity of catalyst in phenol hydrogenation. Both catalysts using a lower or higher amount of ZIF-67 showed a comparable catalytic activity in this transformation (entries 5 and 6). The NiCo/MgxNiyO-imp(10) catalyst, prepared by an impregnation method, was also evaluated in phenol hydrogenation. However, the conversion was markedly lower (entry 7) than that of NiCo/MgxNiyO(10). In addition, a pure Co catalyst prepared by the calcination and reduction of ZIF-67 (XRD results, Fig. S1) showed a quite low activity in this reaction with only a 5.5 % conversion (entry 8), demonstrating the crucial role of the bimetallic NiCo catalysts in the activity enhancement. Furthermore, the turnover frequency (TOF) of this hollow NiCo/MgxNiyO(10) catalyst was calculated to be 588 h−1, higher than most of the reported Ni-based catalysts (Table S1). Notably, despite a small amount of cyclohexanone was produced at the beginning of the reaction, nearly all phenol can be converted into cyclohexanol over NiCo/MgxNiyO in a reaction time more than 2.5 h (Fig. S2). As is well known, stability is one of the most important features for heterogeneous catalysts. Accordingly, the used NiCo/MgxNiyO(10) catalyst was separated by a magnet and then reused in a next batch of phenol hydrogenation. The recycling experiment of NiCo/MgxNiyO-imp(10) revealed an significant decrease in activity (Fig. 1 a). Notably, the optimal NiCo/MgxNiyO(10) catalyst showed a superior activity and stability (Fig. 1b) with the conversion being higher than 85 % even after six cycles, indicating that NiCo/MgxNiyO(10) has a stable catalytic performance in phenol hydrogenation. Table 2 shows the physicochemical properties of NiCo/NixO(0), NiCo/MgxNiyO(5), NiCo/MgxNiyO(10), NiCo/MgxNiyO(15) and NiCo/MgxNiyO-imp(10). The ICP-OES results revealed that the Ni and Co loadings were roughly equivalent in those NiCo/MgxNiyO catalysts. It was found that the addition of Mg markedly increased the BET surface and pore volume of NiCo/MgxNiyO(5), compared to NiCo/NixO(0). By increasing the Mg content, the NiCo/MgxNiyO(10) catalyst showed the highest BET surface of 40 m2 g−1, leading to more active species and thus the highest catalytic activity in the hydrogenation of phenol. In contrast, with further increase of Mg content, the BET surface of NiCo/MgxNiyO(15) decreased, which can be attributed to the adhesion of the ZIF-67-derived hollow structures. Furthermore, the higher H2 adsorption capacity, metal surface area, and metal dispersion of NiCo/MgxNiyO(10) can also account for its highest activity, compared with those of its counterparts (Table 2). Fig. 2 shows the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm and BJH pore diameter distribution of these catalysts. As presented, all samples revealed the typical IV-type adsorption isotherms with H3-type hysteretic loops, indicating the existence of mesoporous structure. [44] This can also be further confirmed by the results of pore diameter distribution (inset of Fig. 2) that the pore diameter of NiCo/MgxNiyO(10) was markedly larger than that of NiCo/MgxNiyO-imp(10), which may facilitate the diffusion of reactant and product molecules, thus enhancing the catalytic activity in the hydrogenation of phenol. Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized catalyst precursors and the corresponding catalysts. The diffraction peaks of ZIF-67 (Fig. S1) were well matched with the XRD data of ZIF-67 in the literature, [45] demonstrating the formation of phase-pure ZIF-67. In Fig. 3A, the NiMgCo-LDH shows the typical diffraction peaks of hydrotalcite-like materials at 2θ = 12.3°, 22.1°, 33.4° and 59.5°, in which no peak was indexed to ZIF-67, indicating that its crystalline structure was destroyed during the formation of LDH. On the other hand, it can be found that the diffraction peak of NiMgCo-LDH at 12.3° was increased with increasing the Mg content, demonstrating that the addition of Mg facilitated the high degree of crystallinity and ordered lamellar structure of the LDH materials, [46] resulting in the increased BET surface areas of NiCo/MgxNiyO and thus the improved catalytic activity. After calcination, NiMgCo-LDO(10) presented three phases (Fig. 3B, curve a): NiO, MgNiO2 spinel (JCPDS 24-0712) [47] and Co3O4 (JCPDS 42-1467), suggesting that the ZIF-67 nanocrystals acted as not only the self-sacrificing template but also the Co source. [48,49] In contrast, for NiMgCo-LDO-imp(10), no obvious diffraction peaks of Co3O4 components were detected (Fig. 3B, curve b), as most of Co(II) were leached during the formation of MgCo-LDH on the ZIF-67, in agreement with the low Co content in NiCo/MgxNiyO-imp(10) (Table 2). After reduced by H2 flow, the obtained NiCo/MgxNiyO(10) showed three diffraction peaks at 2θ = 44.4°, 51.7° and 76.3° (Fig. 3B, curve c), which can be assigned to the (111), (200) and (220) planes of the face-centered cubic (fcc) phase of the NiCo alloy and were consistent with the reported data, [50] indicating the successful formation of NiCo alloy. Comparison of curves c and d revealed that most of the Ni(II) and Co(II) in NiCo/MgxNiyO(10) have been reduced to metallic state, whereas a large amount of Ni(II) remained in NiCo/MgxNiyO-imp(10). These results revealed that the proportion of spinel-like MgNiO2 in NiCo/MgxNiyO(10) was much lower than that in NiCo/MgxNiyO-imp(10). Considering that MgNiO2 spinel was difficult to be reduced during the preparation process, [51] this led to a lower Ni availability, and then resulting in the lower activity of NiCo/MgxNiyO-imp(10). The reducibility of the catalyst precursors was further evaluated by TPR measurement (Fig. 4 ). For NiMgCo-LDO-imp(10), four H2 consumption peaks can be observed: a small shoulder at 254 °C, a principal peak at 293 °C, two broad peaks at 527 and 863 °C, which can be indexed to the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO, the subsequent reduction of NiO, CoO, and MgNiO2 spinel, respectively. [52,53] It is obvious that a large amount of MgNiO2 spinel in NiMgCo-LDO-imp(10) was difficult to be reduced by hydrogen under the reduction conditions adopted (H2, 500 °C), in agreement with the XRD results. This led to a low amount of the active NiCo species than that of the optimum catalyst NiMgCo-LDO(10), even if their Ni loadings were roughly equivalent. As for NiMgCo-LDO(10), at low temperature zone, only one large peak was observed at 319 °C, where the small reduction peak of Co3O4 to CoO have been obscured by the peak of NiO to Ni(0). Notably, this reduction peak was shifted to a higher temperature compared with that of NiMgCo-LDO-imp(10), indicating the stronger interaction between the NiCo species and the support. Other peaks at 485 and 642 °C were corresponded to the reduction of NiCo species that have moderate and strong interactions with the support, respectively. These results demonstrated that the interaction between the NiCo species and the support was beneficial to the stability improvement of NiCo/MgxNiyO(10). Fig. 5 shows the SEM images of ZIF-67, NiCo-LDH(0), NiMgCo-LDH(5), NiMgCo-LDH(10), NiMgCo-LDH(15), and MgCo-LDH(10). As presented in Fig. 5a, the as-synthesized ZIF-67 crystals have a rhombic dodecahedral structure, which is the same as those ZIF-67 nanocrystals reported in previous literatures and their particle sizes are ∼1 μm. [54] In Fig. 5b–e, one can see that a large number of LDH platelets were assembled on the ZIF-67 template via an edge-to-face stacking. The NiMgCo-LDH was formed through the co-precipitation of Ni(II), Mg(II) and Co(II), in which Co(II) was derived from ZIF-67 due to the etching effect of the ethanol solvent. It was found that the surface roughness can be significantly enhanced by the introduction of Mg (Fig. 5b–e). The NiMgCo-LDH(10) showed a more rugged surface morphology and dispersed nanoparticles (Fig. 5d), leading to the largest BET surface and resulting in the highest catalytic activity in phenol hydrogenation. In contrast, when the Mg content further increased (Fig. 5e), the particles of NiMgCo-LDH(15) tended to aggregate to form bonded hollow structure, which decreased the BET surface from 40.0–19.6 m2 g−1 (Table 2). However, in Fig. 5f, no regular morphology was observed, suggesting that it was difficult for divalent Mg(II) and Co(II) to form MgCo-LDH nanoplates on the surface of the ZIF-67 template. Fig. 6 shows TEM images of the fresh and recycled NiCo/MgxNiyO(10) catalysts. In Figs. 6a and S3, the fresh NiCo/MgxNiyO(10) catalyst has a typical contrast image with bright inner cavities and dark shells, indicating the hollow structure of NiCo/MgxNiyO(10). On the other hand, the size of cavities was almost in consistent with that of ZIF-67 nanocrystal, further confirming that the hollow structure was derived from the ZIF-67 template. An enlarged TEM image (Fig. 6b) showed that the NiCo nanoparticles with an average diameter of about 19 nm were well dispersed and implanted in the mixed metal oxides. The lattice spacing of 0.208 and 0.178 nm in the high resolution TEM (HRTEM, Fig. 6c) matched well with the (111) and (200) lattice plane of CoNi alloy, [55–58] in agreement with the XRD results. The lattice spacing of 0.242 and 0.210 nm can be assigned to the (111) and (200) lattice plane of MgNiO2 spinel. As shown in Fig. 6d, the NiCo/MgxNiyO(10)-used catalyst retained the hollow structure even after 6 cycles, accounting for its good catalytic stability. The chemical surface characteristics of NiCo/MgxNiyO(10) and NiCo/MgxNiyO-imp(10) are tested by XPS measurements (Fig. 7 ). As can be seen, both NiCo/MgxNiyO(10) and NiCo/MgxNiyO-imp(10) showed four main peaks (Fig. 7a), locating at the binding energies (BE) of 852, 854, 855 and 861 eV, which correspond to Ni, NiO, NiMgO2 spinel, and satellite peaks, respectively. [59,60] In Fig. 6b, the peaks at the BE values of 778, 780, and 785 eV can be assigned to Co, CoO, and satellite peaks. The presence of NiO and CoO can be ascribed to the surface oxidation in ambient air during the sample transfer for XPS tests. Notably, from the Ni 2p and Co 2p core level XPS spectra, both samples exhibited Co(0) and Ni(0) at the BE values of around 777 and 852 eV. By comparing these two samples, one can clearly see that the BE values of Co(0) and Ni(0) in NiCo/MgxNiyO(10) were higher than those in NiCo/MgxNiyO-imp(10), indicating the stronger interaction between the metal species and the support. [61,62] As a result, the agglomeration and sintering of the active species can be suppressed, thereby facilitating the stability of the NiCo/MgxNiyO(10) catalyst. The H2-TPD profiles of Ni/CoyO(0), NiCo/MgxNiyO(5), NiCo/MgxNiyO(10), NiCo/MgxNiyO(15), and NiCo/MgxNiyO-imp(10) were shown in Fig. 8 . One can see that all samples revealed only one hydrogen desorption peak with similar areas, but the proﬁle of NiCo/MgxNiyO(10) showed the narrowest hydrogen desorption peak in a low temperature zone. These results indicated that the active species in NiCo/MgxNiyO(10) trended to become uniform, making it more active than other catalysts, thus explaining the best activity of NiCo/MgxNiyO(10) in the hydrogenation of phenol. Based on the above studies, one can conclude that the hierarchical structure, including the special hollow structure, lamellar structure from LDH and NiCo alloy NPs, may result in the high specific surface area, low mass transfer resistance, a large number of active NiCo species, and thereby improve the catalytic activity in the hydrogenation of phenol, as demonstrated by the highest TOF value of 588 h−1, much higher than the previously reported result on alloyed NiCo NPs (0.21 h−1, Table S1). On the other hand, the confined environment of NiCo NPs derived from the LDH lamellar structure can avoid agglomeration, sintering and leaching of the active species, thus improving the stability of NiCo/MgxNiyO(10). The protocol presented here, involving a hierarchically structured NiCo bimetallic catalyst, exhibited both excellent catalytic activity and good stability in the hydrogenation of phenol. 4 Conclusion In summary, layered double hydroxide derived hollow NiCo/MgxNiyO catalysts have been facilely prepared via the in-situ formation of NiMgCo-LDH platelets on the ZIF-67 nanocrystals. The ZIF-67 nanocrystals acted as not only the self-sacrificing template during the formation of the hollow structure, but also the Co source in the synthesis of NiMgCo-LDH. Detailed characterizations have demonstrated that the combination of hierarchical structure, Mg introduction, and confinement effect, led to the high specific surface area, large number of active NiCo species and strong metal-support interaction, and thereby the improved activity and stability. The optimal catalyst NiCo/MgxNiyO(10) was highly active in the hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanol, and featured with the highest TOF value of 588 h−1 compared with the reported Ni-based catalysts. Thus, constructing hierarchically structured Ni-based catalysts derived from MOFs and LDH provides an alternative approach for the fabrication of highly active and stable non-precious metal catalysts to replace the precious metal catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis.

        "dc:description": "Hierarchical hollow bimetallic NiCo/MgxNiyO catalysts were constructed by assembling NiMgCo layered double hydroxide (LDH) platelets on zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67), followed by subsequent calcination and reduction. The three-level hierarchical structure of NiCo/MgxNiyO catalysts, including the hollow structure, nanolamellar structure and NiCo alloy particles, showed a significant enhancement on the catalytic activity of NiCo/MgxNiyO in the hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanol. The confined environment of the lamellar structure may strengthen the interaction between the active species and support, avoiding the agglomeration, sintering and leaching of the NiCo active species, thus facilitating the stability. The optimal catalyst NiCo/MgxNiyO(10) showed an excellent catalytic performance with 99.9 % conversion and 99.9 % selectivity for cyclohexanol, and featured with a highest TOF value of 588 h−1 compared with the reported Ni-based catalysts. Detailed characterizations have demonstrated that the combination of the hollow structure and the confined effect would benefit the catalytic performance. Moreover, this non-precious metal catalyst can be magnetically separated, and recycled for at least 6 times. This approach provides a valuable guidance for the design and preparation of the non-precious metal catalysts for industrial applications.",
