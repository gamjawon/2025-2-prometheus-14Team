Graphical abstract Propylene polymerization was performed using three constrained geometry catalysts: 2-(tetramethylcyclopentadienyl)-4,6-di-tert-butylphenoxytitanium dichloride (1), 2-(tetramethylcyclopentadienyl)-6-tert-butylphenoxytitanium dichloride (2), and 2-(tetramethylcyclopentadienyl)-6-phenylphenoxytitanium dichloride (3) with Al( i Bu)3/[Ph3C]+[B(PhF5)]4 − as co-catalyst. The substituent effect of the ligand and the effect of the Al/Ti molar ratio on the catalytic properties were investigated. The catalytic activity decreases in the order of 1 > 2 > 3. The 13C NMR results show that the polymers are basically atactic polypropylene with some 2,1-insertion and 1,3-enchainment units in the polymer chain, and the end groups are mainly vinylidene (CH2 CMe–) and vinyl (CH2 CH–) together with a small amount of propenyl (CH3CHCH–). A possible chain propagation and termination mechanism of the propylene polymerization was discussed. Keywords Propylene polymerization Polypropylene Constrained geometry catalyst Metallocene Titanium complex 1 Introduction Group 4 constrained geometry metallocene catalysts, which have an appended chelating heteroatom donor group on the cyclopentadienyl ligand have received extensive attention in recent years [1–3]. In particular the constrained geometry catalysts (CGC) with a pendant nitrogen donor on the cyclopentadienyl ligand, such as Me2Si-(η 5-Me4C5)( t BuN)TiCl2, have been widely studied in industry and academic institutions [4–7]. On the other hand, a considerable number of catalysts with a pendant oxygen donor on the cyclopentadienyl ligand have also been reported [8–14]. However, most of catalysts of this type have not been studied in detail with respect to their catalytic properties [14]. We have recently reported on the synthesis and catalytic properties for ethylene polymerization of a series of new constrained geometry cyclopentadienyl-phenoxy titanium dichlorides [15,16]. Considering that different stereospecific polypropylenes have been obtained with the constrained geometry catalysts of the Me2Si-(η 5-Me4C5)( t BuN)TiCl2 type under different conditions [17–20], we recently studied the catalytic properties for propylene polymerization of our constrained geometry cyclopentadienyl-phenoxy titanium catalysts in detail. The obtained polymers are basically atactic polypropylene with a small amount of –(CH2) n – (n >3) chain units, which are in somewhat extent similar to an ethylene-propylene copolymer. In this paper, we wish to report the results of propylene polymerization catalyzed by three constrained geometry catalysts (Chart 1 ), 2-(tetramethylcyclopentadienyl)-4,6-di-tert-butylphenoxytitanium dichloride (1), 2-(tetramethylcyclopentadienyl)-6-tert-butylphenoxytitanium dichloride (2), and 2-(tetramethylcyclopentadienyl)-6-phenylphenoxytitanium dichloride (3) with Al( i Bu)3/[Ph3C]+[B(PhF5)]4 − as co-catalyst, as well as the characterization of the obtained polymer samples. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Complexes 1–3 [16] and [Ph3C]+[B(PhF5)]4 − [21] were synthesized according to the literature procedure. Al( i Bu)3, n BuLi and TiCl4 were purchased from Aldrich. Polymerization grade propylene (from Petro-China Company) was further purified by passage through a 5A molecular sieve column containing MnO. Solvents were dried and distilled prior to use [22]. NMR spectra were recorded on either a Varian Unity-400 or a Varian Mercury-300 NMR spectrometer. 2.2 Propylene polymerization A dry 250ml steel autoclave with a magnetic stirrer was charged with 80ml of toluene, thermostated at desired temperature and saturated with propylene (1.0bar). The polymerization reaction was started by injecting a mixture of catalyst and Al( i Bu)3 in toluene (10ml) and a solution of [Ph3C]+[B(PhF5)]4 − in toluene (10ml) at the same time. The vessel was repressurized to needed pressure with propylene immediately and the pressure was kept by continuously feeding propylene. After 30min, the polymerization was quenched by injecting acidified methanol [HCl (3M)/methanol=1:1]. The mixture was stirred overnight and the polymer was collected by filtration, washed with water, methanol, and dried at 60°C in vacuo to a constant weight. 2.3 Characterization The compositions of the polymers were determined by 1H NMR and 13C NMR. The 13C NMR experiments were performed in o-dichlorobenzene-d 4 at 120°C with an acquisition time of 1s, a pulse width of 90° and a delay time of 8s. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Propylene polymerization Complexes 1–3 can all catalyze the polymerization of propylene to produce viscous oily polypropylene with lower molecular weight (M w =1–2×104) upon activation with Al( i Bu)3/[Ph3C]+[B(PhF5)]4 −. Fig. 1 shows the catalytic activity of 1–3 as a function of the Al/Ti ratio at polymerization temperature 70°C. The order of catalytic activity is 1 > 2 > 3, which could be attributed to the nature of the substituents on the phenolate. By comparing the catalytic activity of 1 and 2 or 2 and 3, it can be clearly seen that the electronic effect of the substituent groups at both the para and ortho positions of the phenolate plays a significant role. For all complexes 1–3, the catalytic activity increases with the increase in the Al/Ti ratio and reaches the highest catalytic activities with the Al/Ti ratio of about 70. Further increasing in the Al/Ti ratio results in a decrease in the catalytic activity (also see Table 1 ). This behavior is similar to the results [23,24] observed for propylene polymerization with Cp2ZrCl2/MAO catalyst systems and can be easily explained. Impurities in the reaction system could not be effectively cleaned at lower Al/Ti ratios [25], while excessive Al( i Bu)3 would consume so much [Ph3C]+[B(PhF5)]4 − that the catalyst could not be efficiently activated. Moreover, it has been well documented in literature that different cationic species [26,27] with catalytic activity could be formed when metallocene catalysts are activated with AlR3/[Ph3C]+[B(PhF5)]4 −. Scheme 1 shows the formation and transformation of possible cationic species A–C in the present system. The formation of the less active cationic species C due to a shortage of [Ph3C]+[B(PhF5)]4 − could further decrease the catalytic activity of the system. It is thus important to have enough [Ph3C]+[B(PhF5)]4 − in the polymerization system. The formation of the heterobinuclear cationic adduct B might result in a decrease in the polymer molecular weight with the increase in the Al/Ti radio due to the polymer chain transfer from Ti to Al [28]. However, experimental results (Table 1) show that the polymer molecular weight does not change very much with the change of the Ai/Ti radio, which indicates that the chain transfer to Al is not remarkable in the present system and the chain termination mainly takes place via β-H elimination [29–31] or β-Me elimination [30–32] (see Fig. 2 ). It has been reported that the bulky Al- i Bu unit shows little tendency to exchange with a Zr-polymer unit [33]. 3.2 NMR analysis The 1H NMR spectra of two typical polypropylene samples from catalyst 1 are shown in Fig. 2. Both the resonances at 4.75 and 4.82ppm caused by β-H elimination and the resonances at 4.94 and 5.16ppm caused by β-Me elimination denote hydrogen atoms in unsaturated double bonds on the polymer chain end. The major polypropylene end groups are vinylidene (CH2 CMe–), resulting from β-H transfer following a 1,2-insertion, and vinyl (CH2 C–), resulting from β-H transfer from the methyl group following a 2,1-insertion or from β-Me transfer following a 1,2-insertion. Small amounts of internal olefins are also formed via β-H transfer following a 2,1-insertion [20]. The indiscriminate nature of the propylene polymerization is owing to the open nature of these catalysts. Thereby, 2,1-insertion can take place more readily than in the cases using other metallocene catalysts. The 13C NMR spectra of the typical polypropylene samples from catalyst 1 are shown in Fig. 3 . According to published literatures [34–39], the resonances for the carbons indicated in Scheme 2 can be assigned as shown in Fig. 3. The resonances observed in the region of methyl group (Fig. 4 ) are 22.1ppm for the pentad mmmm, 21.8ppm for mmmr, 21.5ppm for rmmr, 21.3ppm for mmrr, 21.1ppm for mmrm+rmrr, 20.9ppm for mrmr, 20.6ppm for rrrr, 20.4ppm for rrmm, and 20.3ppm for mrrm. The ratio of intensities of the resonances for rmmr, mmrr, and mrrr pentads is roughly 1:1.4:2.9 for the sample in Fig. 3a and 1:0.9:3.26 for the sample in Fig. 3b, which is in agreement with a slightly syndiotactic structure [40]. Methylene carbon resonances of Sαδ+ (38.9–39.2ppm, n =4+), Sαγ (38.1–38.7ppm, n =3), Sβγ (28.1ppm, n =4), Sβδ+ (27.6–27.8ppm, n =5+), and Sββ (25.0–25.1ppm, n =3) can be found in Fig. 3b for the typical polypropylene sample produced at 70°C, which is indicative of the existence of –(CH2) n – chain with n =3–5 and the chain propagation with 2,1-insertion and 1,3-enchainment. The resonance signals of methine carbons found in 35.1–36.0ppm region (Tγδ+, Tδδ+) support the above structural features. Resonances of adjacent methyls in tail-to-tail fragments are found in the 14–18ppm region in Fig. 3, and the resonance from 14.7 to15.9ppm and 17.0 to17.8ppm can be assigned to Pαβ and Pαγ with r and m stereochemistry, respectively. Based on above NMR analysis, a possible chain propagation mechanism as shown in Scheme 3 is proposed to explain the microstructure of the polypropylenes. The –(CH2) n – segments found in polypropylenes can be formed by a 2,1-insertion, a 1,3-enchainment, or their combination [39]. The existence of long –(CH2) n – segments indicates that the polypropylenes produced by these catalysts are somewhat similar to the ethylene-propylene (E/P) copolymers. Dyad, triad and pentad distribution and statistical analysis for the polypropylenes were calculated and listed in Table 2 . Triads% and rde% [41] values also indicate that the polypropylenes are slightly syndiotactic. The fact that 1,3-% values increase with the increase in reaction temperature indicates that the 2,1-insertion increases compared with 1,2-insertion at high temperatures. 4 Conclusion Upon activation with (Al i Bu3)/[Ph3C]+[B(PhF5)4]−, complexes 1–3 can catalyze propylene polymerization to produce basically atactic polypropylenes with lower molecular weight (M w =1–2×104). The order of catalytic activity for propylene polymerization under similar conditions is 1 > 2 > 3. 1H NMR analysis indicates that the polymer chains are terminated with vinylidene and vinyl groups. 13C NMR analysis indicates that the polypropylenes obtained are somewhat similar to an ethylene-propylene (E/P) copolymer with long –(CH2) n – (n ≥2) sequence units.
