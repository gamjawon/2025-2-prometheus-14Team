Fax: +91 40 27193991. Polyaniline–iodine salt is proved as a simple, efficient, versatile, recyclable and eco-friendly polymer based solid acid catalyst in the reaction between aromatic amines and N-vinyl pyrrolidone/N-vinyl caprolactam under solvent free condition. Polyaniline salts such as polyaniline-sulfate, polyaniline-hydrochloride and polyaniline-perchlorate are also catalyzing this reaction smoothly. Graphical abstract Highlights ► PANI serves as recyclable catalyst to synthesize cis tetrahydroquinolines. ► PANI-I2 catalyst is more stable, recyclable, less hygroscopic and corrosive than I2. ► The developed process conforms to the principles of ‘green’ chemistry. Keywords Polyaniline salt Catalyst recycling Green chemistry Heterogeneous catalyst Stereoselectivity 1 Introduction The tetrahydroquinoline scaffold is existing in many natural products or synthetic materials and its derivatives exhibit a broad range of biological activities in various fields [1–3]. In particular, 4-aminoquinoline ring systems represent an important class of compounds [4] that has been shown to have interesting pharmacological properties such as antimalarial [5], analgesic [6,7], anti-inflammatory [8], antitumor [9] and antihypertensive agents [10] as non-nucleoside HIV-1 inhibitors [11,12] and as reversible inhibitors of (H+/K+)-ATPase [13]. The biological activity of these substituted tetrahydroquinolines has attracted continuous interest in developing new methods for their synthesis [14]. Among those efficient protocols towards the imino-Diels–Alder reaction between N-aryl imines and electron-rich dienophiles is probably a most powerful synthetic tool for the construction of nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds including substituted tetrahydroquinolines [15], due to its efficiency and the ready availability of starting materials. 2-Methyl,4-substituted tetrahydroquinoline derivatives have usually been synthesized from the reaction of substituted aniline and N-vinyl pyrrolidone (NVP) by the traditional method using acid catalysts [16–20]. According to the reference of Mahadeven et al. [16] using 4-nitro phthalic acid, the reactions were completed within 2–4h with 88–94% yields in acetonitrile at 50°C. However, reusability nature of this catalyst has not been reported. Subsequently, Hosamani et al. used copper pyridine dichloride as catalyst [17] under the same condition and obtained the product (90% yield) in 3h with recyclability. The phosphotungstic acid catalyst reaction reported by Kavitha et al. [18] mentioned the completion of reaction within 1h with 75–79% of 2-methyl tetrahydroquinoline derivatives in acetonitrile at room temperature. Similarly, the report of indium trichloride catalyst [19] reaction was completed within 10–60min. in water under reflux condition with higher yields. Very recently, Chen and Lee reported this reaction using FeCl3 catalyst [20] in acetonitrile solvent at reflux condition and obtained the product in 74% yield in 8h. Thus, these reactions have some drawbacks like prolonged reaction time, non recoverable catalyst, toxic and expensive catalysts. Therefore, the search continues for a better catalyst for the synthesis of tetrahydroquinolines in terms of operational simplicity, reusability, low cost and green catalyst. In order to improve the synthetic methodology, polyaniline based solid acid catalysts have been used as better catalysts in the synthesis of cis 2-methyl-4-substituted tetrahydroquinoline derivatives. 2 Experimental 2.1 Instruments and characterization Powder of PANI salt was pressed into disk of 13mm diameter and about 1.5mm thickness under pressure of 400MPa. Resistance of the pellet was measured by two probe methods using 2010 digital multimeter (Keithley, Cleveland, Ohio, USA). FT-IR spectra of PANI salts were registered on a FT-IR spectrometer (Thermo Nicolet Nexus 670, USA) using the KBr pressed pellet technique. X-ray diffraction profiles for PANI salt powders were obtained on a Siemens/D-500 X-ray diffractometer, USA using Cu Kα radiation, scan speed of 0.045°/min. Morphological studies of PANI salt powders were performed using Hitachi 3000N, Tokyo, Japan scanning electron microscope operating at 10kV. The sample was mounted on a double-sided adhesive carbon disk and sputter-coated with a thin layer of gold to prevent sample from possible charging. The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDAX) spectroscopy was analyzed with an EDAX detector (Oxford LINK-ISIS 300) with Jest 520 microscope. 1H NMR spectra of all the products in DMSO-d6 with TMS as internal standard were taken using Avance-500/Inova-400 instruments. 2.2 General procedure for preparation of polyaniline salt catalyst Polyaniline base and polyaniline salts containing sulfate, per chlorate and hydrochloride were prepared by aqueous polymerization pathway via our earlier reported procedure [21]. Polyaniline–iodine salt was prepared by the following procedure. Polyaniline base (0.5g) was added to 50ml of acetonitrile solution containing 0.04M iodine (I2) and the mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 4h. The resultant mixture was filtered, washed with acetonitrile followed by acetone until colorless filtrate and dried at 50°C till a constant weight. 2.3 General procedure for polyaniline salt catalyzed domino tetrahydroquinoline synthesis In a typical experiment, a mixture of aromatic amine (1mmol), N-vinyl lactam (2mmol) and PANI-I2 catalyst (14wt.% with respect to N-vinyl lactam) under solvent free conditions was stirred at 80°C for 10min. (Scheme 1 ) Then EtOAc was added to the reaction mixture, filtered and separated the catalyst. Organic layer was washed with water followed by brine, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and concentrated. The crude material was purified by column chromatography using silica gel (60–120mesh) and eluted with petroleum ether: ethyl acetate (8:2). Isolated yield was calculated and the margins of error in these experiments are ±1%. All the products were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass spectroscopic data and compared with the literature values [16–20]. Recyclability experiment was carried out using the separated catalyst, wherein, the separated catalyst was washed with acetone and dried in an oven for 50°C for 2h. 2.4 Spectral data As representative systems, spectral data for the two compounds are given here. 2.4.1 cis-1-(6-Chloro-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-4-yl) pyrrolidin-2-one m.p. 150°C.

We have been using conducting polymer systems as polymer based solid acid catalysts in various organic transformations [23]. In continuation of our interest in the use of conducting polymer based solid acid catalysts, in this work, polyaniline–iodine salt was prepared by doping of polyaniline base with acetonitrile solution of iodine. This polyaniline–iodine salt was characterized by infrared, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, EDAX, conductivity and density measurements. Polyaniline–iodine salt is used as catalyst in the synthesis of 2-methyl-4-substituted-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline derivatives. 3.1 Characterization of polyaniline–iodine catalyst 3.1.1 Infrared spectra of PANI-I2 The infrared spectrum of PANI base, PANI-I2 and recycled PANI-I2 are shown in (Fig. 1 ). The major characteristic peaks obtained 2000 to 750cm−1 for the three polyaniline samples are reported in Table 1 . Polyaniline base showed the ring stretching of quinoid (Q) and benzenoid ring (B) form at 1581 and 1495cm−1, respectively. The C–N stretching band of an aromatic amine appears at 1375 and 1295cm−1 are attributed to stretching vibration of QBQ and QBB and BBQ respectively. Polyaniline shows a strong band at 1134cm−1, which has been explained as electronic like absorption of NQN. The C–H out-of-plane bending mode has been used as a key to identifying the type of substituted benzene. Polyaniline base showed a peak at 810cm−1 indicative of 1,4-disubstituted benzene. A similar observation has been reported in the literature for PANI base [24,25] On doping of polyaniline base with iodine, the infrared spectrum (Fig. 1b) showed that the peaks due to quinonoid, benzenoid, electronic like absorption and 1,4-disubstituted benzene are shifted to lower wave number (Table 1). This shift clearly indicates the formation of polyanilinium radical salt. 3.1.2 XRD pattern of PANI-I2 X-ray diffraction pattern of PANI base (Fig. 2a) showed a broad peak around 2θ=19°, which is characteristic peak of amorphous polyaniline base [26]. X-ray diffraction profiles registered for PANI-I2 (Fig. 2b) showed two broad peaks around 2θ=9 and 19° with corresponding d-spacing 4.9 and 2.4. The addition peak centered on 9° indicates the insertion of iodine into PANI base, which leads to ordering of PANI-I2. This is in accordance with the report XRD result for CSA doped polyaniline [27,28] 3.1.3 SEM and EDAX of PANI-I2 Morphological structures of polyaniline samples were revealed by scanning electron microscopy. PANI base showed agglomerated particles (Fig. 3 ), whereas, polyaniline salt showed agglomerated fiber like structure (Fig. 4 ). EDAX of PANI-I2 showed the amount of iodine present in the polyaniline chain (52wt.%) in addition to carbon (46%) and nitrogen (2%). This result supports that PANI salt contains I2 dopant. 3.1.4 Conductivity of PANI-I2 Conductivity of the polyaniline salt measured by two probe methods showed 4.5×10−5 S/cm, which is 7 orders of magnitude higher than that of PANI base (insulator level, <10−12 S/cm). Increase in conductivity result confirms that insulating PANI base is converted to doped PANI salt. The density of PANI-I2 salt was found to be 1.45g/cm3, which is higher than that of PANI base (1.2 to 1.3g/cm3). 3.2 Synthesis of 2-methyl-4-substituted tetrahydroquinoline using PANI-I2 catalyst Molecular iodine has received considerable attention as a homogeneous catalyst for accelerating various organic transformations. Molecular iodine catalyzed domino reaction of anilines with cyclic enol ethers, such as 2,3-dihydrofuran (DHF) and 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran (DHP) in presence of solvents (CH3CN, CH2Cl2) leading to the synthesis of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolines has been reported [29]. In this work, domino reaction of aniline (1mmol) with N-vinyl pyrrolidone (2mmol) was carried out using iodine catalyst (50mg, 0.2mmol) under solvent free condition at 80°C for 10min. This reaction gave the corresponding 2-methyl-4-pyrrolidin-2-one-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline derivative in 91% yield. In this reaction, the N-vinyl caprolactam and N-vinyl pyrrolidone are not only the dienophiles but also serve as precursors of acetaldehyde (Scheme 1). However, iodine catalyst cannot be reused again in this reaction. In order to make reusable catalyst, in this work, we have synthesized iodine doped polyaniline as a polymeric Lewis acid catalyst. PANI-I2 (14wt.% with respect to N-vinyl pyrrolidone) is used as a catalyst for the same reaction, which gave the product (93%) in less time i.e., 5min. In order to find out the nature of the polyaniline salt containing acids such as PANI-HClO4, PANI-H2SO4 and PANI-HCl are used as catalyst in the reaction and the results are included in Table 2 . Product was obtained in 5min with the use of PANI-HClO4 catalysts. However, lower yield was obtained with the use of PANI-H2SO4 and PANI-HCl salts. Variation in yield with the use of different catalysts is due to differences in the activity of the catalysts. The reaction was carried out with increasing amount of catalyst, i.e. 2 to 14wt.% with respect to N-vinyl pyrrolidone and the product was obtained in less time with increasing amount of catalyst (Fig. 6 ). The almost linear relation could be an evidence of good access of reactants to the active sites due to the facilitation by the well ordered structure. Product was obtained in 5min with use of 14wt.% of the catalyst. The reaction was extended using PANI-I2 catalyst at ambient temperature in various solvents and the results are reported in Table 3 . The product was obtained in 1h with acetonitrile, 2h in toluene and 4h in dichloromethane and lower yield was obtained with the use of methanol (20%) and ethanol (45%) in 4h. However, product was not obtained with the use of tetrahydrofuran and water. In order to find out the versatility of PANI-I2 catalyst, the reaction was extended with various aromatic amines (1mmol) and N-vinyl lactam (2mmol) at 80°C under solvent free condition for 10min and the results are reported in Table 4 . Reaction went smoothly in all cases with excellent yield (89–94%). 3.3 Recyclability Reusability of the PANI-I2 catalyst was verified for the model reaction of aniline with N-vinyl pyrrolidone under solvent free condition at 80°C for 5min. The reaction gave cis isomer with 93% yield. Recyclability was checked by separating the catalyst from the reaction mixture by filtration followed by purification using acetone and used in the reaction again. This procedure was carried out for 5cycles and obtained the cis product in 93, 92, 91, 92 and 91% respectively. After the recyclability experiment, the catalyst was analyzed by infrared (Fig. 1), X-ray diffraction (Fig. 2) and SEM analyses (Figs. 4 and 5). A similar result was obtained for the catalysts before and after the reaction. The above results indicate that there is only a negligible change in the activity of the catalyst. 4 Conclusion Polyaniline salts have been proved as simple, easily synthesizable, easy to handle, workable, stable, low cost, versatile, efficient, recyclable green catalyst for the synthesis of cis-2-methyl-4-substituted-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline derivatives. This method may be a valid contribution to the existing methodologies of tetrahydroquinolines. Acknowledgments The authors are thankful to Dr. J. S.
