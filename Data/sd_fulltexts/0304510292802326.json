E. Vol'pin and G. N. Novodarova Institute of Organoelement Compounds, Russian Academy of Sciences, Vavilova 28, Moscow 117813 (Russia) Abstract The connections between homogeneous and enzymatic catalysis provide a promising field for investigation. Synthetic metal complexes were suggested to be used as catalysts to influence some biochemical processes. Various aspects of the catalytic action of Co chelates upon biochemical redox processes were considered. In particular, it was found that some of the cobalt catalysts can be integrated in electron transport at the subcellular level in mammalian mitochondria and bacterial chromatophores. It was shown by special experiments that the Co catalysts reacted with biochemical redox chains at the level of quinolic components (coenzyme Q, etc.), accepting electrons from them. Such a process competes with the enzymatic one. In addition, the possibility of using Co chelates as catalytic generators of active oxygen radicals aimed at various cell targets, especially DNA and RNA, was investigated. Also, metal complexes generating oxygen radicals could be a promising basis for the development of new fungicides. These compounds stimulated the formation of active oxygen in fungitoxic concentrations in a host plant and inhibited the development of disease; for example, the Co complexes investigated here have demonstrated high fungicide activity toward rice blast disease. In our opinion, these approaches provide new possibilities for the regulation of biochemical processes and should promote the creation of new compounds with high biological activity. Introduction Transition-metal complexes are known to be active as catalysts in many chemical reactions. On the other hand, natural catalysts - enzymes demonstrate very high catalytic activity in living cells. We supposed that synthetic metal-complex catalysts could display their activity not only in chemical, but also in biochemical, systems - in living cells. This problem is important for several reasons. First, these synthetic catalysts could provide possibilities for creating new types of physiologically active compounds with catalytic properties. Also, a lot of chemical waste, from ligands and transition-metal compounds, is produced by industry and pollutes the environment. We must be able to predict the catalytic action of the waste on living organisms - animals, plants, microorganisms - in order to protect the environment. 0304-5102/92/$5.00 1992 - Elsevier Sequoia. All rights reserved 154 Our aim was to find catalysts capable of taking part in the main biological redox processes, respiration and photosynthesis. These processes are fundamental. The stepwise oxidation of organic substrates takes place in the respiratory chain of mitochondria, resulting in electron transfer from organic substrates to oxygen through the chain of components: NADH; FAD; coenzyme Q; cyt. c, b, a *. The energy formed is used for ATP formation. We attempted to catalyse the electron transfer from some components of the cellular respiratory chain directly to molecular oxygen, bypassing the enzymatic process by means of homogeneous catalysts. Naturally we turned to redox active transition-metal complexes - catalysts of the oxidation processes. We were most interested in the oxidation of the main components of biological redox chains and the mitochondrial respiratory chain, such as NADH, quinoles, and cytochromes. The strategy of our investigation may be divided into three levels: chemical, biochemical, and biological. The chemical level included the search for metal complexes possessing catalytic activity in the oxidation electron-transfer components. The biochemical level included the study of the interaction between catalytically active complexes and biochemical electron-transfer systems, located in the cell's organells, mitochondria and chromatophores. The biological level included the study of the biological activity of the complexes that we found to be the most active in chemical and biochemical systems. Chemical systems First we studied the catalytic activity of a wide range of transition-metal complexes in the model reactions of autooxidation of NADH, ubiquinol models, and cytochrome c [ 1 ]. The catalytic action was studied in detail for the following types of cobalt complexes (Fig. 1): transition-metal complexes with Schiff bases (I); porphyrin complexes (II); o-phenanthroline complexes (III); and corrin-type complexes (IV). The catalytic activity of some cobalt complexes in the autooxidation of NADH, Q4H2 (analogue of coenzyme Q), and cytochrome c are presented in Table 1. Co(II) chelates with Schiff bases, o-phenanthroline, and octadehydrocorrin were found to be the most active and most promising catalysts. We studied the kinetics of NADH oxidation in the presence of Co(salen) and Co(dmodc) complexes. In both instances the reaction is close to first order with respect to catalysts and 0.5 order with respect to NADH substrate. The catalytic reaction can be described as follows: \"Abbreviations: NADH=reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; FAD =flavine adenine dinucleotide; cyt=cytochrome; salen=N,N-bis(salicyliden)ethyleneaiamine; dmodc= 1,2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18,19-decamethyloctadehydrocorrin; phen=o-phenanthroline; TTFA= thenoyltrifluoroacetone; DMPO=N,N-dimethy1pyrroline oxide. 155 X +m I 0~M~O nl \\ / \\ H CHZCHZIJ M,n 1 III \\ \\~-~ -,N\\ / I N~ N - ~., r - \\ N N / N M N / A. li Iv Fig. 1.

The reaction occurs via the radical mechanism. Factors essential for oxidative catalysis of quinolic substrates were studied. First we wanted to elucidate the role of hydrophobic properties of ligands of the metal complexes in the catalytic oxidation of quinolic substrates, by varying the hydrophobic character of the latter. Cobalt-corrin complexes, hydrophobic derivatives of the B12 series, were prepared. This series included heptaalkylcobyrinates (alkyl = methyl, n-butyl, n-heptyl) (Fig. 2). The heptyl ester of cobyrinic acid turned out to be the most hydrophobic complex. Cobyrinic acid and cobinamid were the least hydrophobic. The catalytic activity of con-in complexes in the autooxidation of quinoles of various hydrophobicities has been studied (Table 2). The effect of `hydrophobic affinity' was observed, viz. the maximum rate of autooxidation was observed when the hydrophobic properties of a substrate and a catalyst are similar. It should be emphasized that all corrin complexes possess the same Co environment. X-ray CoK 65 spectra and ESCA data have shown that the electronic configurations of ester substituents do not affect nitrogen and cobalt atoms. This means that the different oxidation rates were caused only by the hydrophobic interaction between a substrate and a catalyst. It should be emphasized that the chemical oxidation of biogenic reductants can result in the formation of various active oxygen species, i.e., hydrogen peroxide, superoxide, and OH radicals (eqns. (1)-(3)): [COIII]+AH2+02-j [Coa]+2H++A+OZ (1) 202 + 2H+ --> 02 + H202 (2) [CoII]+Hz02--> [COIII]+OH-+OH' (3) ROC + ROC COR `COR ROC III N ~N- v COR ROC N I /N COP CO Ct04 / ROC N/ ROC B ROC COR ROC COR f R=OAPk A=B Co11 Co Y OMe OH [Co(cor)(OH)2 ]me [Co(cor)]',ectu4 01BU OH [CO(cor)(OH)2 JBu [Co(cor 'e~Ct04 OHept 0H [Co(cor)(oH)Z ]Hept [Co(cor)]*H,tct04 NH2 OH [Co(cor)(OH)2 ]NHz OH O H [ Co(cor)(OH)2 ] OH Fig. 2.

Actually, it was shown that the formation of hydrogen peroxide in the autooxidation of NADH and quinols was catalysed by Co-corrin complexes [3]. The formation of OH radicals in the reaction of Co(II) corrin complexes of the B series with hydrogen peroxide was detected by ESR spectroscopy with trap DMPO [4]. Thus the study of the oxidative transformation of biological substrates under the action of Co catalysts led us to the conclusion that catalytically active Co complexes may be used either for creation of catalytic electrontransfer processes as models of biochemical redox systems or as catalytic generators of active oxygen radicals directed to targets in the cell. Biochemical systems We first investigated the influence of Co complexes on the mitochondrial electron-transfer chain and tried to catalyse the electron transfer from some components of the respiratory chain directly to molecular oxygen, making a bypass for the enzymatic process via the transition-metal complex. For example, the effect of Co(dmodc) on a substrate oxidation occurring in rat liver mitochondria was studied [5]. Upon addition of Co(dmodc), the oxidation rate of the NADH-dependent substrate increased three-fold and for succinate, six-fold. It is worth noting that the corresponding nickel complex, Ni(dmodc), which is inactive in model chemical reactions, was also inactive in the mitochondrial redox chain. Then the problem emerges - which of the respiratory-chain components donates electrons to the Co complex? Specific respiratory-chain inhibitors 158 were used in the experiments. The oxidation of succinate and NADH catalysed by Co(dmodc) was insensitive to the addition of antimycin A, which inhibits electron transfer in the cytochrome b region of the respiratory chain. The complete respiration inhibition was observed upon addition of TTFA, which hampers electron transfer in the succinate dehydrogenase:coenzyme Q stage. rotenone Glutamat e' antimicin A Malat - NADH --i FAD I - cyt b - cyt c -- cyt a -- Succinate 2~ FAD II -CO complex TTFA 'bypass' All these data indicate that coenzyme Q is the most probable electron donor for Co complex. This conclusion was proved by the following experiment: the addition of Co(dmodc) to the submitochondrial particles deficient in endogenous coenzyme Q has no influence on the rate of oxidation, but the subsequent addition of coenzyme Q restored the catalytic effect of Co complex. Thus we have demonstrated the capability of Co(dmodc) complex to maintain a catalytic process of electron transfer from coenzyme Q to oxygen in a biological redox chain at the subcellular level. We also studied the action of transition-metal complexes on photoinduced bacterial electron transfer in purple bacteria [ 61. In this case, the redox chain is localized in intracellular closed membranous structures - chromatophores - which can be isolated from purple bacteria. The primary photosynthetic processes occur in so-called reaction centres - molecular complexes of porphyrin pigments with certain quinoles. These structures are the smallest fragments possessing the specific photochemical activity of photoinduced electron transfer from bacteriochlorophile to quinone acceptors. The effect of o-phenanthroline complexes on electron transfer in reaction centres and chromatophores of purple bacteria was studied. The addition of Co(II)-tris(o-phenanthroline) complex stimulates a ninefold increase in electron transfer in the reaction centres. Special experiments with flash photoactivation demonstrated that the rate of bacteriochlorophile rereduction in the darkness is much higher in the presence of Co complex than in its absence. This can be explained by the fact that Co complex, undergoing consecutive oxidation and reduction, can bypass the segment of the electrontransfer chain between the oxidized pigment and reduced quinones (Fig. 3a). The addition of Co complex to bacterial chromatophores was shown to enhance the electrochemical potential gradient on the membrane. This was the result of incorporation of lipophilic Co complexes in the electron-transport chain of the chromatophore membrane, providing electron transfer from quinole to bacteriochlorophile (Fig. 3b). Thus active Co catalysts can be incorporated in the biochemical redox process, stimulating direct electron transfer and bypassing the enzymatic process. 159 _ IH+ membrane e - Q2~r--_e 2 i i '!'%~ LQ, Fe] [Co(phen)3] (Ct04)2 [Q; Fe] QZH `''It\\`(Bfht)2 e Cyt c t membrane (a) Reaction centre (b) i Chromatophores Fig. 3. The effect of Co-phenanthroline complexes on the photoinduced electron transfer in the reaction centre and chromatophores from purple bacteria (Q, =primary quinone, Q2 =secondary quinone). Finally, we studied the effect of Co-phenanthroline complexes on electron transfer in green plant chloroplasts [ 7 ]. It was found that some of the Co complexes can influence the plastoquinones pool, bypassing the usual path of electron transfer to pigment P700 in photosystem 1. It should be noted that the molecular organization of photosystem I is similar to that of the bacterial system. Thus the most important result obtained in this part of the work is that some artificial chemical catalysts can be incorporated in biochemical redox processes on the subcellular level and be used in the electron-transfer reaction, bypassing the natural redox carriers, mainly quinols. Another type of interaction between Co catalysts and biochemical systems is catalytic generation of active oxygen species aimed at targets in the cell. Recently it was found that iron and copper complexes known to catalyse the production of active oxygen species could result in noncatalytic cleavage of a DNA molecule in the presence of oxygen and a reducing agent [8]. These oxygen species, it was suggested, might also be responsible for cleavage of DNA by some antitumor antibiotics, e.g., bleomycine and adriamycine [9]. We expected that Co complexes, being effective in the catalytic autooxidation of biogenic reductants and capable of catalytically generating active oxygen species, could also induce catalytic DNA cleavage, having nuclease activity. We investigated the possibility of catalytic DNA cleavage in the presence of Co catalysts, reducing agents, and molecular oxygen. The plasmide pBR 322 was used as the DNA target. The plasmide is a double-chain ring superspiralised molecule (form I) containing more than 4000 pairs of nucleotides. Cleavage of one chain or of both chains resulted in the relaxed form (II) or the linear form (III), respectively. The yields of forms II and III provide a measure of the activity of the Co complexes in the DNA-cleavage reaction. We found that Co catalysts are active in the catalytic cleavage of the DNA molecule in the presence of reducing agents, ascorbate or quinoles, 160 and molecular oxygen [10]. The Co-corrin complexes are the most active in the catalytic cleavage of DNA, giving up to 10090 of form II. Co-salen complexes do not catalyse the complete disappearance of superspiralised form I, but cause cleavage of both DNA chains, resulting in the linear form III. In the absence of a reducing agent the Co complexes do not split DNA. On the basis of the earlier experiments we can suggest the following sequence of reactions: [Co'L]+DNA +---4 [Co'aL]-DNA [Co,',L]-DNA+O2+AH2-~ [Co'IL]-DNA+H202+A [CoaL]-DNA+H202 ) [CoE'L]-DNA+OH'+OH- We believe that active CO(Il) catalyst intercalates in DNA, and hydrogen peroxide decomposition and generation of OH radicals take place in close proximity to the target molecule. The following facts are in agreement with this scheme: catalase inhibits DNA cleavage; superoxide dismutase has no influence on DNA cleavage; the existence of OH radicals was demonstrated in the chemical system containing the Co catalyst and the reducing agent. It was found that Co-corrin complexes also induce the effective cleavage of RNA [11 ]. In this instance tRNAP\" and 5s RNA of E. coii ribosomes were used as the RNA target. The nuclease activity of the complexes studied was in good agreement with their catalytic redox properties. Catalytically active dioxy cobinamide and cobyrinic acid displayed nuclease activity, while catalytically inactive cyancobinamide did not. Comparison of the nuclease activity of Co-corrin [11] and Cu-o-phenanthroline [ 12 ] systems has shown that Co-corrin RNA cleavage proceeded more effectively but less selectively than that of Cu-phenanthroline. The mechanism of the nuclease action of Co-corrin catalysts was elucidated using the p-nitrophenyl ester of tymidylic acid. It was found that the reaction involved attack of OH radical on the C(1) atom of the sugar moiety, resulting in cleavage of the N-glycoside bond, followed by sselimination with the split of the polynucleotide chain [ 11 ]. This confirms the postulated nucleic acid cleavage mechanism for Co-corrin and Cu-phenanthroline complexes. In our opinion, these results provide new approaches for the specific modification of nucleic acid structures using Co catalysts. Biological systems The results of chemical and biochemical investigations open many possibilities for biological applications of catalytically active complexes. The phytoimmunity of plants can be enhanced, for example. Recent publications include new information about the participation of oxygen-active forms in the phytoimmunity mechanism. It has been shown that oxygen 161 radicals are released with leaf secretions in fungitoxic concentrations [ 13 ] when potato or rice plants are infected. One could suggest that chemical compounds that can stimulate oxygen activation should also increase the resistance of plants to phytopathogens. As described above, some cobalt complexes can generate active oxygen species during the oxidation of biological substrates and could be a promising basis for the development of new fungicides. We tried to detect the fungicide activity with respect to rice blast disease of Co-phenanthroline complex, which showed high catalytic activity in biochemical systems [14]. The Co complex added to the cultivation medium affected neither the spore germination of Pyricularia rnyzO in vitro nor the growth rate of the fungi colony. However, the presence of cobalt-phenanthroline complex in the inoculum on the leaf surface (10 mcg ml-1) inhibited the development of the disease. The disease symptoms were also not observed when the complex was introduced into the soil (see Table 3). It should be mentioned that the fungicide action of Co complexes on the spore germination was inhibited by superoxide dismutase. On the other hand, the generation of superoxide radicals (OZ) in diffusates of leaves treated by Co complex was detected by adrenaline oxidation to be more intensive than that in untreated ones. These results show that the Co complex stimulates in the host plant the formation of active oxygen in fungitoxic concentrations, and in this way inhibits the development of the disease. Thus the design of compounds that stimulate the generation of oxygen radicals in plants is a new approach to the development of new fungicides. The data obtained prove that synthetic homogeneous catalysts can catalyse redox transformations of biological substrates at the level of biochemical systems. In our opinion, this approach provides new possibilities for the regulation of biochemical processes and should promote the creation of new compounds with high biological activity.

These compounds stimulated the formation of active oxygen in fungitoxic concentrations in a host plant and inhibited the development of disease;for example, the Co complexes investigated here have demonstrated high fungicide activity toward rice blast disease. In our opinion, these approaches provide new possibilities for the regulation of biochemical processes and should promote the creation of new compounds with high biological activity.

        "dc:description": "The connections between homogeneous enzymatic catalysis provide a promising field for investigation. Synthetic metal complexes were suggested to be used as catalysts to influence some biochemical processes. Various aspects of the catalytic action of Co chelates upon biochemical redox processes were considered. In particular, it was found that some of the cobalt catalysts can be integrated in electron transport at the subcellular level in mammalian mitochondria and bacterial chromatophores. It was shown by special experiments that the Co catalysts reacted with biochemical redox chains at the level of quinolic components (coenzyme Q, etc.), accepting electrons from them. Such a process competes with the enzymatic one. In addition, the possibility of using Co chelates as catalytic generators of active oxygen radicals aimed at various cell targets, especially DNA and RNA, was investigated. Also, metal complexes generating oxygen radicals could be a promising basis for the development of new fungicides. These compounds stimulated the formation of active oxygen in fungitoxic concentrations in a host plant and inhibited the development of disease;for example, the Co complexes investigated here have demonstrated high fungicide activity toward rice blast disease. In our opinion, these approaches provide new possibilities for the regulation of biochemical processes and should promote the creation of new compounds with high biological activity.",
