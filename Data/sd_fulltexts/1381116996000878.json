Co(acac)2 or Fe(acac)3 were the catalysts used in homogeneous phase reactions whereas Co(II) or Fe(III) supported complexes, obtained by copolymerization of Co(AAEMA)z or Fe(AAEMA)3 (AAEMA-= deprotonated form of 2-(acetoacetoxy)ethyl methacrylate) with acrylamides, were the heterogeneous catalysts. The supported metal complexes were recyclable and did not suffer from metal leaching.

Introduction The oxidation of a-hydroxyketones represents the most direct route to a-diketones. The commonly used procedure for the synthesis of benzils from benzoin and derivatives is the cupric acetate promoted reaction with ammonium nitrate [ 1 ]. Other catalytic methods more recently developed to oxidize benzoins to benzils employ air, perchloric acid or p-benzoquinone as the oxidants and nickel [2], thallium [3], ytterbium [4], iron [5] or molybdenum [6] complexes as the catalysts.

PH S 1381-1169(96)00087-8 Following our study on the catalytic activity of a-diketonato complexes [7] and of their heterogeneous analogues [8] in oxidation reactions under Mukaiyama's conditions [9] (e.g. aerobic oxidations carried out in the presence of excess sacrificial aldehyde or aldoacetal) we discovered a new method for the oxidation of cx-hydroxyketones such as benzoin, 4,4'-dimethylbenzoin and 4,4'-dimethoxybenzoin (anisoin) to the corresponding a-diketones (Scheme 1). 2. Results and discussion The catalytic activity of several metal diketonates was explored using anisoin as the sub- 34 M.M.

When Co(acac)2 or Fe(acac)3 were employed, high yields of anisoil (> 88%) were obtained after 4 h and 5 h respectively. On the contrary, Ni(acac)2 and Cu(acac)2 in the same conditions, gave high conversions of the starting material but in both cases the major reaction product was p-anisic acid deriving from cleavage of the C-C bond. The same product was also obtained when the reaction was performed under Mukaiyama's conditions but in the absence of any metal catalyst, or when the oxidation was carried out by m-chloroperbenzoic acid procedure. The results obtained when benzoin (1), anisoin (2), and 4,4'-dimethylbenzoin (3) were exposed to oxidizing conditions in reactions catalysed by Co(acac)2 and Fe(acac)3 are summarized in Table 1. Co(acac)2 was more active compared to Fe(acac)3 and the reactivity of the tested substrates followed the order: benzoin > anisoin > 4,4'-dimethylbenzoin. In the case of benzoin the reaction reached completion after 1.5 h (Co(acac)2, entry 1) or 4 h (Fe(acac)3, entry 2). In the other cases the reactions stopped before completion at a maximum 86% conversion obtained with anisoin in the presence of Co(acac)2 (entry 3), due to the Table 1 Oxidation of benzoins under Mukaiyama's conditions a Entry Substrate 1 benzoin 2 benzoin 3 anisoin 4 anisoin 5 6 Catalyst Time Conversion Yield CO(acaC)2 1.5 F0(aC)3 4 CO(acac)Z 4 Fe(aC)3 5 4,4'-dimethyl-benzoin Co(acac)Z 2 4,4'-dimethyl-benzoin Fe(acac)3 2 a 1.2 mmol substrate, 0.020 mmol metal complex, 3.6 mmol i-butyraldehyde, 5.0 ml 1,2-dichloroethane, room temperature, atmospheric pressure of O2. 100 100 86 52 70 43 94 85 96 89 95 97 Table 2 Oxidation of benzoins by Fe(acac)3 and Co(acac)2 under Mukaiyama's conditions a Entry Substrate Catalyst Time Conversion Yield 1 anisoin Co(acac)Z 1 2 anisoin Fe(acac)3 1.5 3 4,4'-dimethyl-benzoin Co(acac)2 4 4 4,4'-dimethyl-benzoin Fe(acac)3 6 96 84 94 82 94 97 95 94 a 1.2 mmol substrate, 0.020 mmol catalyst, 4.0 ml 1,2-dichloroethane, room temperature, 1 atm Oz. 3.6 mmol i-butyraldehyde was added as follows: 0.9 mmol were present at the beginning of the reaction and 2.7 mmol dissolved in 2.0 ml of 1,2-dichloroethane were added dropwise in the course of the reaction at a rate of 2.7 mmol/h. untimely consumption of the sacrificial aldehyde. To overcome this inconvenience we have carried out the oxidations of (2) and (3) by dropping part of the aldehyde in the course of the reaction, thus achieving much higher conversions of the starting material and high yields in the desired a-diketone (Table 2). The same expedient has been used for the first time by us in the Co(acac)2 catalysed oxidation of diphenylsulfide under Mukaiyama's conditions [ 10]. We have carried out additional tests using propionaldehyde diethyl acetal in the place of i-butyraldehyde. Preliminary experiments showed that in the absence of metal catalysts negligible conversion was achieved and that catalytic reactions run at room temperature were quite slow. Anisoin gave 98o conversion after 45 h with Co(acac)2 and 76o conversion after 62 h with Fe(acac)3. Carrying out the reactions at 50 and using 3.6 mmol acetal with Co(acac)2 and 6.0 mmol acetal with Fe(acac)3 it was possible to achieve 100o conversions and quantitative yields in benzils for all the substrates (Table 3).

Experimental 3.1. Materials and apparatus Chromatographic analyses were carried out on a Hewlett Packard 5890 instrument using a 25 m SPB-1 capillary column. GC-MS data were acquired on a HP 5890 chromatograph (30 m SE30 column) coupled with a mass selective detector HP 5970B, 70 eV. The oxidized products were identified by comparison of their MS spectra and retention times in GC analyses with those of authentic samples. Conversions and yields were calculated by GLC analyses as moles of oxidized product per mole of starting a-hydroxyketone by using the internal standard method. The difference to 100% in the reported yields was ascribable to small amounts of para-substituted benzaldehyde and para-substituted benzoic acid. The metal acetylacetonates, benzoins and propionaldehyde diethyl acetal were purchased by Aldrich and used as received; i-butyraldehyde was distilled prior to use. The supported Co(II) and Fe(III) complexes were prepared as described by us elsewhere [8]. 3.2.

Dell'Anna et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 111 (1996) 33-36 the substrates (2) and (3), as described in the caption of Table 4) in 1,2-dichloroethane (4 ml) and stirred under dioxygen at room temperature till completion of the reaction, as monitored by GLC analysis. After reaction, to the suspension was added cold petroleum ether and filtered. The solid was treated with acetone causing the extraction of the diketone and the separation of the supported catalyst. The resin was washed with acetone and diethyl ether, dried under vacuum and opportunely recycled. The acetone solution was evaporated or added to water and the solid residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (hexane-diethyl ether) to afford the desired a-diketone.
