Reduced samples were then tested as catalysts for carbon dioxide hydrogenation. It is observed that whenever the zeolitic phase is present, reduction of the iron species is strongly encumbered. As a consequence, over such catalysts the reverse water-gas shift reaction occurs specifically while formation of hydrocarbons does not occur. This is attributed to the lack of formation of surface carbidic species which appear to be responsible for the hydrocarbon formation. Keywords: Carbon dioxide hydrogenation; Crystallinity; Hydrocarbon synthesis; Iron silicalite 1. Introduction Potential applications of transition metal-containing zeolites are quite large. For example, the presence of a transition metal within the pores of the zeolite should limit the metal particle size. Moreover in such a system molecular sieving effects of the zeolite could also be operative. Among the transition metal zeolites, iron silicalites of MFI type have been one of the most thoroughly investigated [ 1-9 ] . The migration of iron (III) from the zeolite framework to the channels has been invoked as the main problem in most * Corresponding author. E-mail kaspar@dschsunl.univ.trieste.it, tel.

Kaspar et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 117 (1994)125-137 catalytic processes involving these ferrisilicalites [ 2,4,10,11 ] . Nevertheless, Fe203 particles were embedded within ZSM-5 crystals to obtain a Fischer-Tropsch catalyst which was selective for formation of light hydrocarbons [ 12,13 ] . However, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements revealed formation of particles of appreciable size [ 13 ] . A possible route for introducing the metal into the zeolite is that of synthesizing the zeolite in the presence of transition metal salts. Framework substitution of aluminum with catalytically active elements and subsequent modification can provide a means for generating a high dispersion of the active phase within the zeolite framework [ 14] . In this work molecular sieves of the ZSM-5 type with iron isomorphously substituted for aluminum were synthesized and tested as catalysts for the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide. At present this reaction is gaining interest as carbon dioxide could be used as an interesting alternative feed stock [ 15 ] . Hydrogenation of carbon dioxide readily proceeds over a number of supported transition metals [ 16-18] but in most cases methane is almost exclusively formed. Previous studies indicated that this reaction proceeds via the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGSR) in which carbon monoxide is produced as intermediate [ 19,20] . Iron-based catalysts are industrially used both in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis [ 21 ] and in the water-gas shift reaction [ 22] and therefore they should be potentially good catalysts for hydrogenation of carbon dioxide to hydrocarbons. 2. Experimental 2.1. Syntheses and characterization of the catalysts Sodium silicate (Na20 - 2Si02 - H20), NaOH, H2S04 96%, and n-buthylamine (NH2Bu) were purchased from Carlo Erba. Tetrapropylammonium bromide (TPABr), Fe2(S04) 3 - 5H20 and Fe(N03) - 9H20 were purchased from Aldrich. Syntheses of the catalysts were carried out by a slight modification of a published procedure [23] by forming the synthesis gel under acid conditions which favors incorporation of iron and by adding successively the template. Apart from the use of TPABr [ 23 ] , use of NH2Bu as template was also attempted. It was shown that linear ammine templates can also induce formation of a MFI framework [ 24 ] . A typical gel composition (Si02/Fe2O3 = 40) is characterized by the following ratios: 32 TPABr:20 Na20:1 Fe203:40 Si02:715 H20. Hydrothermal treatment (crystallization) was carried out in a non-stirred autoclave at 160 (under autogenous pressure) for 3 or 8 days. Decomposition and calcination were carried out in argon at 500 and in air at 400, respectively. NW and K+ forms were prepared by ion exchange of respectively NH4C1 and KCl (0.1 mol dm- 3 g -1) 5 h at 90. The H+ form was obtained by calcination of the NW sample at 350 for 4 h. In the following text the denomination FeSi-(as) will indicate the as-synthesized sample, FeSi-(c) the decomposed and calcined sample, FeSi-(H) and FeSi-(K) J. Kaspar et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 177 (1994)125-137 127 will indicate the H+ and K+ forms, respectively. All the samples were characterized by means of powder XRD pattern and IR spectroscopy using a Siemens D500 model X-ray powder diffractometer and a Perkin-Elmer 983 spectrophotometer. Relative amounts of crystalline phases present in the samples were estimated from the powder XRD data by comparing with standards the integrated intensities of peaks at 22-25(2O) for the ZSM-5 [ 25 ] , (001) basal plane reflection at 5(2O) for magadiite (a layered silicate of formula Na20 - 14Si02 ' 9H20) and a peak at 21(2O) for quartz. Size of the a-iron particles in the reduced catalyst was determined by the X-ray line broadening method. The distribution and oxidation states of the iron species in the Fe-ZSM-5 samples was studied by electron spin resonance (ESR) using a Varian E-12 spectrometer operating at 9.5 GHz, at room temperature. The experimental lines were fitted to the derivative of a Lorentzian and the contributions of several sites to the same resonance were taken into account. The relative concentration of the sites is assumed to be proportional to A (H), where A and H are the amplitude and the line width obtained from the fitting, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out on a JEOL 300 microscope using an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. Samples of the catalysts were deposited on the holder and successively gold coated (3 nm) in order to reduce the charge build up on the sample. 2.2. Catalytic tests and temperature-programmed reactions Catalytic tests were carried out at atmospheric pressure in a stainless steel flow micro reactor (4.6 mm I.D., 100 mm long). Typically 0.25-1 g of catalyst were loaded into the reactor and the internal dead volume was filled with granular quartz. Reduction of the catalysts was carried out in situ at 500 for 12 h in flow of hydrogen (20 ml min-'). Space velocities of 400-1000 h-' were used and the carbon dioxide conversion was always less than 5%. Catalytic measurements were carried out in the range of temperatures from 250 to 400. Between each incremental step in the reaction temperature the catalyst was treated in a flow of hydrogen at 350 to clean the metal surface from deposited carbon [ 16 ] . The analyses of the reactor effluents were performed with an on-line Hewlett-Packard 5890 gas chromatograph. Separation of the products was achieved on a 25 m long PoraPLOT Q wide bore (0.25 mm I.D.) capillary column. A splitter located at the outlet of the column enabled simultaneous detection of both C02, CO and CH4 on a TCD and hydrocarbons on a FID. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was carried in flowing H2/Ar mixture (5 %) at a rate of 10 min-' from 25 to 1000. Temperature-programmed decarburization (TPDC) was carried out on reduced samples which were initially treated at reaction conditions (350, H2/C02=1, W/F=2.1 10-2 gC .at min ml-') for 30 min and then in a flow of helium (20 ml min-') for 5 min. Decarburization was then carried out in flowing hydrogen (20 128 J. Kaspar et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 117 (1994)125-137 ml min-') at a heating rate of 5 min-'. The evolved products were monitored by means of on-line gas-liquid chromatography (GLC). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Syntheses and characterization Different samples were synthesized by varying the ratio Si02/ Fe203 from 15 to 80 and the nature of the organic additive i.e. n-butylamine and tetrapropylammonium bromide. Results of characterization of these samples are reported in Table 1. Generally speaking, ZSM-5 can be synthesized over a large interval of Si02/Al203 ratios and in the presence of a variety of organic additives [24] or even in their absence [ 26] . Synthesis of the iron substituted ZSM-5 type molecular sieves is quite sensitive to the nature of the organic additive and to the ratio Fe203/SiO2, due to both the lower crystallization rates of Fe-ZSM-5 compared to ZSM-5 and to the possibility of complexation of iron by the organic additive [ 27 ] . In our case the zeolitic phase crystallizes in the presence of NH2Bu only at ratios of Si021 Fe203 much higher than 20. At this ratio an amorphous iron containing product was indeed obtained. With this sample no Fe203 was detected by XRD, which suggests that iron is dispersed in the catalyst. At higher (up to 80) Si02/Fe2O3 ratios, besides some amorphous material, in the as-synthesized sample, the crystalline zeolitic phase is present, but it always coexists with magadiite (Na20 - 14Si02 - 9H20) and a-quartz phases (Sample 2, Table 1). This is in agreement with the synthesis of ZSM-5 since magadiite, silica and amorphous phases coexist with ZSM-5 structure when using different templating agents [ 24,28,29 ] . In this material, iron appears to be incorporated only partially into the framework Table 1 Composition of the catalyst precursors Sample SiOz/a NazO/e K20/e A.E.O/Organic additive Phases present` Fe203 Fe203 Fe203 Fe203 ( % ) Fesi-1(c) 16.5 0.48 - 0.48 NHZBu amorphous(100) FeSi-1(H) 16.8 0.29 - 0.29 Fesi-1(K) 16.3 0.29 0.15 0.45 Fesi-2(c) 38.9 1.79 - 1.79 NHZBu ZSM-5 (45) Magadiite (40) a-Quartz (15 ) FeSi-2(H) 39.3 0.18 - 0.18 FeSi-2(K) 39.1 1.24 0.39 1.63 Fesi-3(c) 39.8 0.84 - 0.84 TPABr ZSM-5 (100) As determined by XRF. .E.O.

However, some ion exchange capacity appears to be present in all the materials as suggested by the data reported in Table 1. The high alkaline earth oxides (A.E.O.)/Fez03 ratio observed for samples FeSi-2, can be attributed to the presence of magadiite which, as is stated below, is destroyed during the decomposition step. It appears that in the ion-exchange process, NH4CI is capable of efficiently extracting Na+ from the overall sample, presumably due to its acidity, while Na+ extraction is limited when KCl is employed. A highly crystalline, white Fe-ZSM-S product was obtained by using the TPABr as templating agent ( Table 1) . XRD analysis of this sample revealed only a ZSM5 type product and a ratio of 0.8 of the intensities of the IR bands at 450 and 550 cm- t which suggested a high crystallinity in our product [ 30,31 ] . The sample morphology was examined by SEM. Fig. 1 reports SEM micrographs of the as prepared samples FeSi-1( as ) -FeSi-3 ( as ) . Consistently with the results of XRD characterization, sample FeSi-1(as) (Fig. lA) consists of agglomerates of irregular particles, amorphous to X-ray. Similar agglomerates can also be identified in the micrograph of sample FeSi-2 ( as ) ( Fig. 1 B ) , which however also clearly shows the presence of two-dimensional platelets ( this phase is detailed Fig. 1 C ) and of a third phase consisting of spherical agglomerates of small parallelepipedal crystallites ( in the lower right part of Fig. 1 B ) . Consistently with previous reports [ 32,33 ] the shapes of the latter phase is associated with the presence of crystalline 130 J.

Therefore the phase detailed in Fig. 1C is associated with magadiite as identified by XRD. All the as-synthesized samples were thermally treated to remove the organic products by a two-step procedure ( see Section 2) . During these treatments, magadiite transforms to a-quartz, while the zeolitic phase appears not to be affected. To examine the influence of the cation on the catalytic activity of these samples, H+ and K+ forms have also been prepared by ion exchange. 3.2. Distribution of iron species in different sites of the Fe-ZSM-S samples The ESR spectra of the different samples are composed of lines attributed to iron(III) species in different sites which have already been observed in zeolites [7,9,32]. Fig. 2 shows the ESR spectrum of the as-synthesized sample, labelled FeSi-3(as). At least two sites are occupied by Fe\": (a) in the zeolite framework, characterized by low field lines (g=7.6, 4.3 and 1.9) and (b) outside the framework but inside the cavities and channels, characterized by lines of G = 2.0. In order to identify the ESR lines associated with different crystalline sites, theoretical simulations were made for the powder spectrum. The superposition of the powder spectrum with g values of 7.6, 4.3 and 1.9 and two isotropic lines with g = 2 (high symmetry environment) gives a good reproduction of the experimental spectrum of Fig. 2. Lines Lt, L2, L3 and LQ can therefore be attributed to Fe 3+ in tetrahedral symmetry. There are also other sites occupied by Fe 3+ which contribute to a symmetrical g = 2 line L5. Among them are the charge compensation interstitial sites and the iron oxide-like clusters FeXO,,. In order to have an idea of the evolution of these sites with calcination ( sample FeSi-3(as) giving sample FeSi-3(c)), and with reduction under hydrogen flow J.

Three symmetrical Lorentzian resonances were considered: with g = 4.3 (L2) and g = 2.0 (L4) representing framework sites, and with g = 2.2 (L5 ) representing sites outside the framework. The results of the fitting of the experimental data to these three resonances are in Table 2. Fig. 3 shows the result of the fitting for the reduced sample FeSi-3 (H2) . An analysis of the data in Table 2 shows that in the FeSi-3(as) sample ca. 15% of the total Fe\" ions are located in the framework. Calcination reduces the framework Fe 3+ to ca. 9%, indicating a migration of ca. 40% of these sites to sites outside the framework, the total amount of iron(III) ions remaining constant.

Concluding, the ESR analysis shows that during calcination part of the framework Fe 3+ migrates to the channels and cavities, and that parts of these extra structural Fe 3+ are reduced by hydrogen to ESR room temperature silent iron species. 3.3.

Formation of carbon monoxide have also been detected in some cases [ 16] while formation of higher hydrocarbons (HC + ) is quite rare [ 20] . Some years ago, Weatherbee and Bartholomew [ 16] reported selectivities towards formation of HC + up to 3.9% over a Fe/S'02 catalyst at 253. It appears from Table 3 that higher hydrocarbons can be obtained only over the amorphous samples. Thus in the case of the sample FeSi-1(H), at a reaction temperature as high as 350, an overall HC + selectivity of 0.50% can be calculated from the data reported in Table 3. At the same temperature Fe/Si02 shows a selectivity of 0.41 %. The apparent activation energies reported in Table 3 are significantly lower than the value of 134 kJ/mol reported for Fe/Si02 catalyst by Weatherbee and Bartholomew [ 16] . The different reaction conditions, i.e. H2/CO = 4 and lower reaction temperatures employed in that study, can easily account for the differences observed. In fact, it was reported [ 16,18] that shift of the rate determining step (r.d.s.) from carbon monoxide dissociation to Cads hydrogenation is observed on increasing reaction temperature and/or pressure, resulting in lower activation energies. As far as the catalytic activity of the crystalline samples are concerned, only traces of methane have been detected, carbon monoxide being formed as the only reaction product. Notably, the carbon monoxide formation rates appear not be greatly affected by the degree of crystallinity of the sample (compare samples FeSi-2 and sample FeSi-3 (c)) . The hydrogenation of carbon dioxide is generally believed to proceed via carbon monoxide as intermediate [ 18-20] . Presence of vapor-phase carbon monoxide seems to play an important role in C-C bond formation at least in the case of Rh/ Ti02 catalysts [20,34]. Such a role could be important also over the iron based catalysts as is shown by the carbon monoxide hydrogenation experiment over the sample FeSi-1(c) reported in Table 3. As a matter of fact, when a carbon monoxide pressure as close as possible to that observed in the carbon dioxide hydrogenation is employed, similar chain propagation probabilities and methane formation rates are observed in both reactions. This result is somewhat conflicting with results observed over the crystalline samples since, despite the appreciable carbon monoxide formation rates (especially when considered on Fe basis), no hydrocarbons are formed in the reaction. 3.4. Temperature-programmed reduction TPR carried out on calcined samples (Fig. 4) and O data (Table 1) can give a clue to explain the different behavior of the crystalline and amorphous samples. The TPR profile of sample FeSi-2(c) shows two peaks at 600 and 740. This suggests that after the 12 h reduction at 500, most of the iron is not reduced to Fe Consistently, no peaks attributable to a-Fe were found in the O of the used catalyst (Table 4). As far as the highly crystalline Fe-ZSM-5 sample FeSi-3(c) is concerned, three peaks at 50, 460-480 and 850 are observed in the TPR profile. 134 J. Kaspar et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 117 (1994)125-137 FeISI02 E FeSI-1(m) o c 0 v c d 0 a. FoSI-2(a9) FeSi-3(as) 200 400 800 8001000 Fig. 4. Temperature-programmed reduction of Fe/SiOz and of the as-synthesized samples FeSi-1(as)-FeSi-3( as ). Our ESR results have shown, in accordance with several authors [4,5,7,9,11,23,32,35], that in Fe-ZSM-S zeolites Fe 3+ is distributed over different kinds of sites, namely extra lattice Fe203 particles and framework sites of different geometries. Recently, a Mossbauer study on the stability of a Fe-ZSM-S zeolite in hydrogen at 300-400 appeared in the literature [36] and it was shown that on prolonged heating in the presence of hydrogen below 400, part of the framework Fe 3+ is reduced to Fe z+ but no Fewas detected. The TPR reported in Fig. 4 is consistent with such a picture: the peak at 50 can be associated with easily reducible extra lattice Fe203 particles while at higher temperatures part of the framework Fe 3+ migrates to the cavities and channels were they are reduced to Fee+. Finally at 850, collapse of the zeolite structure occurs and the iron species are further reduced. Consistently, XRD shows that the crystallinity of the FeSi3 ( c ) sample is preserved after the reduction at 500. Despite the observation that most of the iron species are located outside the framework already after the calcination, the lack of HC formation in the catalytic experiments suggests that they are not reducible to Fe' species as long as the crystalline phase is present. Surface carbide species which are responsible for HC formation are indeed formed on Fe' only (see later). Finally, after the TPR experiment, cristoballite and a-Fe are observed. J. Kaspar et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 117 (1994)125-137 135 Table 4 Temperature-programmed decarburization experiments and particle diameters of a-iron in the reduced catalysts Sample Peak temperatures () Peak areas (a-u.)

On the other hand, for the Fe/Si02 and the sample FeSi-1(c), the TPR results suggest that significant fractions of iron species are reduced after the treatment at 500. Particles of a-iron are indeed observed in the XRD spectra (Table 4). The Fe 2+ exchanged Y-type zeolite [37] and Fe 2+ cations stabilized on different supports [ 38 ] effectively catalyze the water-gas shift reaction. Notably, after reduction, only Fe 2+ ions were detected in the ion-exchanged zeolite [37]. 3.5. Temperature-programmed decarburization The presence of surface carbide can account for formation of hydrocarbons in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis [ 38,39 ] . TPDC of the deposited carbon species (Table 4) clearly shows that large amounts of surface carbon species are formed over the FeSi-1 and Fe/Si02 catalyst samples. CZ hydrocarbons were also detected in the experiments carried out over these catalysts. In contrast, only small amounts of scarcely reactive carbon species were detected over the crystalline samples which could account for the lack of hydrocarbons as reaction products. Consistently, in the carbon dioxide hydrogenation over CU /Si02, HC production was enhanced in the presence of iron carbides [40]. Notably, iron carbides were recently shown to catalyze carbon dioxide hydrogenation with good selectivities towards HC formation [ 41 ] . The idea that HC formation is associated with the presence of surface carbides is also supported by the generally lower values of the activation energies observed over the amorphous samples compared to the crystalline ones, since low activation energies were observed when COaas hydrogenation is the rate determining step [ 16]. Accordingly, supported Fe/Si02 is known to carburize rapidly in FischerTropsch conditions [42] while this does not happen for the Fe 2+_y zeolite [ 36] . 4. Conclusions Iron silicalite samples were synthesized by using different templates and Si021 Fe203 ratios. These materials were used as catalysts for carbon dioxide hydrogen- 136 J. Kaspar et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 117 (1994)125-137 ation. They effectively catalyze the reverse water-gas shift reaction, while significant hydrocarbon production was detected only over the amorphous catalyst. Temperature-programmed decarburization experiments show that formation of methane and higher hydrocarbons is associated with the presence of surface carbide species. It appears that notwithstanding the presence of substantial amounts of iron in the extraframework positions, in the presence of a crystalline zeolitic phase, after a reduction up to 500, formation of surface carbidic species which are critical for HC production, does not occur. This could be due to both the lack of reduction of the iron species or to the confinement of the non-framework iron in the pores of these zeolites, which hinders their ability to generate carbidic species. Iron occupying tetrahedral framework sites in the zeolites does not contribute to metal-based catalytic activity ( [ 27 ] and references therein).

Reduced samples were then tested as catalysts for carbon dioxide hydrogenation. It is observed that whenever the zeolitic phase is present, reduction of the iron species is strongly encumbered. As a consequence, over such catalysts the reverse water-gas shift reaction occurs specifically while formation of hydrocarbons does not occur. This is attributed to the lack of formation of surface carbidic species which appear to be responsible for the hydrocarbon formation.
