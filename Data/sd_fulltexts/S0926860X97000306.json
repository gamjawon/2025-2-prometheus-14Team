The main products are 4-t-butylphenol, 2-t-butylphenol and 2,4-di-t-butylphenol, the last of these is the product of further alkylation of the 2-t-butylphenol. 2-t-butylphenol easily isomerises to 4+ butylphenol whereas the reverse reaction is not significant. Separate studies have shown that both butylphenols undergo easy dealkylation. The results of acid site poisoning by adsorption of bases as well as by sililation suggest that the reaction takes place essentially inside the zeolite pores.

Introduction Aluminophosphate molecular sieves are gaining importance ever since they were first synthesised by Wilson and co-workers [1]. They crystallise in a number of structures and are generally written as mlPO4-n, where the number n-indicates the structure type. All of them have alternating A104 and PO4 tetrahedra and are notable by the absence of A1-O-A1 and P-O-P bonds [2]. The A1PO4 frame is more flexible than that of the zeolites and this makes it possible to substitute a variety of atoms at the A1 and P-sites [3]. Although A1PO4 frame is electrically * Corresponding author. Tel.: +91 022 578 2545; fax: +91 022 578 3480: e-mail: dkc@ether.chem.iitb.ernet.in. 0926-860X/97/$17.00 ~ 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

The resulting material known as the SAPO's are Br6nsted acids. Divalent metal ions substituted for aluminium, too generate Br6nsted acidity. Aluminophosphate based molecular sieves are active catalysts for a number of reactions involved in petroleum refining and petrochemicals such as catalytic cracking, reforming, alkylation, methanol to olefins conversion, etc., [4-11]. Although these reactions are also catalysed by acidic zeolites, significant differ- ences are observed in the selectivities. The formation of aromatics, for example, is lower as compared to zeolite-catalysed reactions. This is mainly due to the lower acid strength of the SAPO's. Recently, attention has been focused on the shape selective conversions of hydrocarbons to valuable intermediates for fine chemicals synthesis using SAPO's, as their pore sizes are comparable with the dimensions of simple organic molecules [ 12]. Another important feature of these materials lies in the fact that aluminophosphates with different pore sizes and acid strengths can be synthesised by substitution of P or A1 [3]. SAPO-11 has one-dimensional 10- membered ring channels with an elliptical pore opening of 6.3x3.9 ,~. The structure possesses orthorhombic symmetry with lattice parameters, a=8.4 ,~, b= 18.5 ]~ and c= 13.5 ,~ [ 13]. The free pore opening of SAPO- 11 is more elliptical than ZSM-5 with 10-ring apertures. Alkylphenols are used in the manufacture of synthetic resins, surfactants, lubricating oils and antioxidants. 4-t-Butylphenol is used in the manufacture of varnish and lacquer resins, antioxidant for soaps, ingredient in de-emulsifiers for oil field, motor oil additives, etc. 2,4-Di-t-butylphenol is used in the production of substituted triaryl phosphites. 2,6-Di-t-butylphenol is widely used as antioxidant in foods and other consumable items [14]. Some commonly used catalysts for alkylation of phenol are H2SO4, BF3, aluminium phenoxide, etc. [15]. Catalytic alkylation of phenol using solid acid catalysts may be a very promising way for their synthesis considering the increasing demand for eco-friendly routes in the chemical industry. Cation exchange resins, acidic clays and modified zeolites have been tested for the same [16-18]. Depending on the nature of the catalyst, alkylation of phenol can take place at the oxygen (O-alkylation) and/or at the ring carbon atoms (C-alkylation). Reports [19-22] indicate that the selectivity largely depends on the acid strength of the catalyst. In general, C-alkylation requires stronger acid sites than those responsible for O-alkylation [23-25]. The reaction temperature and the structure of the zeolite have also been found to affect the selectivity pattern [18,25]. C-alkylation of phenol can give rise to 2-, 3- and 4-alkylphenol and multi-substituted products as well. Considering the problems involved in the separation of the isomers, efforts have been made to control their selectivity. In this paper we report the activity and selectivity of the SAPO-I 1 molecular sieve for the alkylation of phenol with t-butanol. There are only a few reports on the butylation of phenol and that too mostly in patent literature [25-28]. S. Subramanian et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 159 (1997) 229-240 231 2. Experimental 2. I. Catalyst preparation SAPO-11 was prepared hydrothermally using di-n-propylamine as the template. The starting materials were fumed silica (Aerosil-200, Degussa), pseudoboehmite (Catapal-B, Vista), ortho-phosphoric acid (85%, Merck) and di-n-propylamine (99%, Merck). Synthesis were carried out in 100ml stainless steel autoclaves lined with PTFE at autogenous pressure without agitation. The molar ratio of the reaction mixture is 1.0 A1203 : 1.0 P205 : 0.4 SiO2 : 1.0 DPA : 50 H20. In a typical synthesis a i : 1 molar mixture of A1203 and P205 was prepared by slowly adding the pseudoboehmite to dilute phosphoric acid, and the mixture was stirred well for 2 h to form a uniform gel. Fumed silica was mixed with water and added drop wise to this gel. followed by the drop wise addition of the template. After adding the remaining part of water, the mixture was stirred for about 2 h. The pH of the final gel was adjusted to 4.5 by adding dilute phosphoric acid. The gel was charged into the autoclaves and kept at 180 for 48 h. After crystallisation, the product was separated from the mother liquor, washed several times with distilled water and dried at 100. 2.2. Catalyst characterisation and reaction studies The SAPO-11 was characterised using X-ray diffraction, chemical analysis and temperature programmed desorption of ammonia. X-ray diffraction pattern were recorded on a PW1720 diffractometer using Ni-filtered CuKc~ radiation. Chemical analysis was carried out by atomic emission spectrometry with an inductively coupled plasma emission source (Labtam Plasma Lab 8440). The SAPO-11 sample was calcined at 500 in air to remove the template and dissolved in aqua regia and the A1 and P in the solution were estimated. The undissolved part of the acid treated sample was fused with lithium metaborate, dissolved in dilute nitric acid for the estimation of Si. Acidity of SAPO- 11 was determined from TPD of ammonia studies. The sample was calcined in air at 500 for 12 h and cooled to 100 in helium. Ammonia was adsorbed at this temperature and the sample was subsequently flushed with helium at 100 for 4 h. Then it was heated in helium (50 cc/min) up to 600 at 10/min. The desorbed ammonia was detected by TCD. Alkylation of phenol with t-butanol was carried out in a down flow glass reactor. About 1.0 g of synthesised SAPO-11 (180-300 ~tm) was calcined in air at 500~C to remove the template and cooled to the reaction temperature under N2. The reactants were fed by a peristaltic pump and vaporised in a pre-heater. Nitrogen was used as a diluent. Gaseous products were collected in a trap and analysed by GC using Porapak-Q column. The liquid products were condensed by passing 232 S. Subramanian et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 159 (1997) 229-240 through an ice-cooled trap attached at the outlet of the reactor and analysed by GC using SE-30 column. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Characterisation studies The X-ray diffraction pattern (Fig. 1) of the SAPO-11 matches well with that reported for this structure [29]. The sample is highly crystalline and without impurities. The chemical composition of the calcined sample can be written as (Sio.o8Alo.5oPo.43)O2. The TPD plot (Fig. 2) of the SAPO-11 sample can be resolved into two peaks, one at 200 and another at 300. The low temperature peak is assigned to weak acid sites such as surface hydroxyl groups and the one at 300 to structural acidity. It can be seen that SAPO-1 l is much weakly acidic than most zeolites. Quantitative measurement of TPD shows 0.058 mmol of NH3/g of acid sites due to low temperature peak and 0.103 mmol of NHa/g due to the high temperature peak. The number of structural acid sites is very much lower than what would be expected if all silicon were substituting only phosphorus atoms in the structure. In this case, each Si will have four A1 atoms as the nearest T-neighbours and each such Si (4A1) will give rise to one acid site. Heterogeneous substitution where the Si atoms replace both A1 and P without creating any Si-O-P bonds will generate 0.75, 0.50 and 0.25 acid sites per Si (3A1Si), Si (2A1 2Si) and Si (1A1 3Si), respectively. An Si (4Si) environment will not produce any acidity. It is well known that in SAPO-11, majority of the silicon atoms form silica-rich regions and hence do not contribute to structural acidity. This has been established by a number of 29Si MAS NMR studies of SAPO-11 [8,30]. 3500 3000 ~ 2500. g 2ooo 1500 1000 500. Ib ~o 3'o ,-b 50 2 0 (drce) Fig. 1. X-ray diffraction pattern of SAPO-I 1. S.

Alkylation of phenol with t-butanol Alkylation of phenol with t-butanol was carried out on SAPO-11 using feed mix of different phenol to t-butanol molar ratios in the temperature range 175-250. In Fig. 3, the amount of phenol and the butylated phenols in the liquid product mixture collected at every 30 min time interval are plotted against time (phenol : t- butanol molar ratio=l : 1).

Subramanian et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 159 (1997) 229-240 the butylphenol decreases with time as the alkylation decreases due to catalyst deactivation. Therefore, the data reported in the tables represent the product collected after one hour on stream (60-90 min). Phenol conversion and the selectivity of the product are given in Table 1. The major product was found to be 4-t-butylphenol with some amount of 2-t-butylphenol and 2,4-di-t-butylphenol. No 2,6-di-butylphenol was formed. Small amounts of dibutyl ether and cracked products were also observed. Only a trace amount (<0.1 wt%) of phenyl t-butyl ether was observed. In a parallel reaction, t-butanol was dehydrated to butenes. Phenol conversion decreased with increasing reaction temperature. Hence, most of the studies were conducted at temperatures close to the boiling point of phenol (180). It has recently been demonstrated that polar molecules such as methanol compete with phenol for the adsorption sites [24] and with increasing molar excess of the alkylating agent, the phenol conversion increases as also observed in the present study (Table 1). The increase in t-butanol : phenol ratio in the feed led to higher phenol conversion but the selectivity to 4-t-butylphenol decreased and that for 2,4-di-t-butylphenol increased. An optimum feed mixture of phenol to t- butanol in 1 : 1 molar ratio was choosen for further investigations as the selectivity for butylphenols was maximum using this feed (Table 1). The effect of contact time on phenol conversion and the product selectivity were studied and the results are given in Table 2. t-Butanol conversion was higher than 99% under these experimental conditions. As expected phenol conversion decreased with increasing space velocity. Formation of 2,4-di-t-butylphenol decreased with the reduction in contact time. SAPO-11 has relatively weak acid sites and it may be expected to give O- alkylated products to a considerable extent. In fact, when phenol was alkylated with methanol on SAPO-11, anisole was the major product at 175 [31,32]. Phenyl t-butyl ether is less stable and hence is formed only at lower temperatures. For example, when phenol was alkylated with t-butanol on Y-zeolite under liquid phase conditions [25], phenyl t-butyl ether was formed only when the reaction was carried out at low temperatures (30). Another reason may be the unstability of the O-alkylated products in 10-membered ring systems than in large pores [24]. Thus, the 10-membered channels in SAPO-11 may be less favourable for the ether formation. However, we have not observed sufficient amount of phenyl t-butyl ether even on SAPO-5 catalyst which contains 12-membered oxygen ring [32]. This observation eliminates the pore size as the reason for the absence of phenyl t- butyl ether on SAPO-11. The interesting aspect of this reaction is the high selectivity of alkylation at the para position. The generally accepted mechanism for aromatic alkylation is that the tertiary carbenium ion interacts with adsorbed phenol forming a ~r-complex, which then rearranges to a-complex by the electrophile attacking a ring carbon atom. The e-complex on proton elimination gives t-butylphenol. It has been suggested [24,33-35] that the Br6nsted acid site interacts with the n-cloud of aromatic ring bringing the molecule parallel to the surface. This, will allow alkylation at the para Table 1 Alkylation of phenol with t-butanol on SAPO-11 at various reactant ratios: Distribution of liquid products e, E Phenol: t-butanol (molar ratio) 1 : 0.5 Temperature () 1:1 1:2 1:4 175 200 225 175 200 225 175 200 225 250 175 200 225 250 Product distribution (wt %) Phenol 60.7 2-t-Butylphenol 4.1 4-t-Butylphenol 31.5 2,4-Di-t-butylphenol 2.5 Others~ 1.2 75.2 84.2 47.8 70.7 87.3 41.0 59.2 80.2 84.9 2.3 1.8 4.6 2.5 1.3 5.0 4.0 1.9 1.4 20.6 12.6 36.5 25.1 10.8 43.8 32.9 15.9 12.6 0.6 - 9.8 1.0 0.2 8.6 2.3 0.4 - 1.3 1.4 1.3 0.7 0.4 1.6 1,6 1,6 1.4 Phenol conversion (wt%) 39.3 24.8 15.8 52.2 29.3 12.7 59.0 40.8 19.8 15.1 p/o Ratio 7.7 9.0 7.0 7.9 10.0 8.3 8.8 8.2 8.3 9.0 Conditions: WHSV=2 h ~; N2/HC =1: TOS =60-90 min. 29.0 52.8 67.4 82. l ~\" 5.6 3,6 2.8 1.5 47.3 34.3 23.0 14.8 ,~ 12.4 1.6 0.8 - ~' 5.7 7.1 5.0 1.6 \"~- 71.0 47.2 32.6 17.9 8.4 9.5 8.3 9.9 a Other products include aromatics and cracked products. ? t,o q~ t.,n 236 S.

Also it has been reported that the steric hinderance in the transition state due to the substitution of bulkier t-butyl group at the ortho positions enhances the para selectivity [18]. The complete absence of 2,6-di-t-butylphenol may also be due to bulkier size and only the less bulkier 2,4-t-butylphenol is formed. Once formed, the para-t-butylphenol will easily diffuse out of the pores. The other important observation is that the amount of phenol in the product mixture increases with increase in the reaction temperature. This is because at higher temperature, the butylphenols are dealkylated to phenol. This aspect will be discussed later. In order to understand the role played by the structural acid sites and the weak acid sites (surface hydroxyl groups), the alkylation experiments were carried out on SAPO-11 samples pretreated with ammonia and quinoline. Ammonia was passed over the SAPO-11 catalyst for about 2 min at 100. Weakly adsorbed ammonia was then removed by flushing the sample by nitrogen at 100 for 4 h. Then the sample was slowly heated under nitrogen to 175, kept at this temperature for 1 h in nitrogen. The butylation reaction was carried out at this temperature. Quinoline was also adsorbed on the sample in a similar fashion. The results of these experiments are given in Table 3. Phenol conversion decreased from 48.8% to 6.5% due to ammonia poisoning. From TPD of ammonia studies it is evident that at 175, only a part of ammonia (those adsorbed at the surface hydroxyl groups) can be removed whereas the strongly adsorbed ammonia at the structural acid sites make those sites unavailable for the alkylation reaction and thus decrease the activity. However, t-butanol was fully converted on this sample, suggesting that t-butanol was mainly dehydrated at the surface hydroxyl sites. After quinoline adsorption, there is no alkylation of phenol taking place as seen from the product distribution (Table 3). The large quinoline molecules essentially poison the external acid sites and also block the pore mouths of the zeolite. This S.

Even t-butanol decomposition is suppressed to a considerable extent. In order to understand the role of acid sites on the external surface, the phenol alkylation was carried out over SAPO-11 sample covered with silica by sililation by chemical vapour deposition method [36-38]. The SAPO-11 catalyst (1 g) was calcined at 500 for 12 h in air and the temperature was reduced to 175 under nitrogen. Dichlorodiphenyl silane (DCDPS; 1 g/h), vapours, mixed with nitrogen was passed over the SAPO-11 sample at 175. After completing the treatment with DCDPS, the temperature was slowly increased to 500 under nitrogen. The sample was then calcined at 500 for 4 h under flowing air and cooled to reaction temperature in nitrogen. This sililation process leads to the formation of a silica overgrowth on the external surface. This will retain the acid sites inside the pores. Structural acid sites on the external surface, if any, will be eliminated. Terminal silanols on the external surface will remain more or less the same. This is not expected to change the catalytic activity if one assumes that alkylation of phenol is taking place essentially within the zeolite pores. The results presented in Table 3, show that phenol conversion and the product distribution pattern on fresh and sililated catalyst remain the same. It indicates that the butylation reaction takes place essentially in the pores of SAPO-11 catalyst. To understand the formation of 2,4-di-t-butylphenol, t-butanol was reacted with 2-t-butylphenol and 4-t-butylphenol separately and also with a mixture of these two isomers.The results are summarised in Table 4. When t-butanol reacted with a mixture of 2-, and 4-, t-butylphenol at 175, apart from the disubstituted 2,4-di-t- butylphenol, considerable amount of phenol was also formed whose concentration in the product increased with increase in the reaction temperature.

Composition expressed in mol%. aOthers include butylether, aromatics and cracked products. 2-t-butylphenol has decreased and that of 4-isomer increased. When 2-t-butyl- phenol alone reacted with t-butanol it undergoes appreciable alkylation to give 2,4- di-t-butylphenol. It also isomerises to 4-t-butylphenol to a large extent. Since SAPO-11 is a medium pore zeolite, the isomerisation will take place via intra- molecular mechanism since the bulkier transition state involved in the intermo- lecular reaction would require larger pore size.

Subramanian et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 159 (1997) 229-240 239 phenol in the product, especially at higher temperatures indicates that the butylphenol undergoes appreciable dealkylation. Thus, phenol conversion decreased at higher temperatures (Table 1). The reaction between t-butanol and 4-t-butylphenol could be studied only at a higher temperature (225) at which dealkylation was the only reaction. Based on these observations the following reaction scheme (Scheme 1) for the t-butylation of phenol has been proposed. Recently in a US patent, Chang et al. [26] have reported that zeolites beta and ZSM-12 show high activity and para-selectivity for t-butylation of phenol. Compared to the zeolites beta and ZSM-12, SAPO-11 is weakly acidic and it contains lower number of acid sites. The good catalytic activity shown by SAPO- 11 for phenol alkylation with t-butanol suggests that t-butylation of phenol can take place easily even in the absence of strong acid sites. 4. Conclusions The medium pore silicoalumino phosphate, SAPO-11 shows good activity and selectivity for phenol alkylation with t-butanol. Poisoning of the acid sites by ammonia and quinoline reduces the activity and the experimental results demon- strate the role played by weak and structural acid sites for phenol butylation. Sililation of SAPO-11, by dichlorodiphenylsilane to remove the external surface acid sites, does not influence the phenol conversion or selectivity which indicates that the reaction occurs inside the pores. 2-t-butylphenol undergoes secondary reactions such as further butylation to form 2,4-di-t-butylphenol and isomerisation to 4-t-butylphenol. Both 2- and 4-t-butylphenol undergo dealkylation to phenol that increases with temperature.

Tel.: +91 022 578 2545; fax: +91 022 578 3480 Alkylation of phenol with t-butanol in the vapour phase on SAPO-11 catalyst has been studied. The main products are 4-t-butylphenol,2-t-butylphenol and 2,4-di-t-butylphenol, the last of these is the product of further alkylation of the 2-t-butylphenol.2-t-butylphenol easily isomerises to 4-t-butylphenol whereas the reverse reaction is not significant. Separate studies have shown that both butylphenols undergo easy dealkylation. The results of acid site poisoning by adsorption of bases as well as by sililation suggest that the reaction takes place essentially inside the zeolite pores.
