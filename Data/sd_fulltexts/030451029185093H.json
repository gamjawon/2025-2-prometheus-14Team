Rebenstorf and C. Panda Research Group on Catalysis, Inorganic Chemistry 1, University of Lund, Box 124, S-221 00 Lund, (Sweden) Abstract Four different chromocenes, in which two hydrogen atoms in the 1 and 1' positions have been substituted by ethyl, t-butyl, trimethylsilyl and phenyl groups, have been reacted with silica gel. As in the case with chromocene (IR bands of adsorbed CO at 2047.1, 1972.2, 1917.2, 1824.1 and 1621.4 cm-1) five strong CO bands are observed, of which the two bands at higher wavenumbers are shifted to lower wavenumbers for the ethyl (2039.7 and 1962.4 cm~1), t-butyl (2042.0 and 1965.2 cm\"1) and trimethylsilyl (2041.3 and 1965.9 cm\"1) compounds and shifted very little for the phenyl one (2045.2 and 1971.9 cm\"1). These two CO bands are interpreted as the asymmetric and symmetric CO stretching vibrations of two CO molecules bonded to one chromium atom. A shift of these bands to lower wavenumbers indicates a higher electron density, and a shift to higher wavenumbers a lower electron density on the chromium. A similar trend is also observed for the three CO bands at lower wavenumbers. On reaction of butyllithium with chromocene and addition of ethylbromide or trimethysilylchloride mixtures of the 1,1'- disubstituted, the monosubstituted and the unsubstituted chromocene were obtained. These mixtures, after reaction with silica gel and CO, showed that in the case of the ethyl-substituted chromocene no higher reactivity for the unsubstituted ligand exists, while for the mixed trimethylsilyl chromocene only the cyclopentadienyl ligand reacts with the silica gel. Introduction Chromium catalysts for the polymerization of ethylene can be divided into the entirely inorganic ones of the Phillips type (Cr(VI) on silica gel [ 1 ]) and organometallic catalysts of Union Carbide type (chromocene on silica gel [2]). These two groups show different catalytic behaviour in the poly- merization of ethylene. This can be partially explained by the difference in electron density on the catalytically active chromium atom. CO has been used to probe this electron density, and three different catalytically active sites have been identified on the Phillips catalyst with IR bands of adsorbed CO at 2180 (Cr(II)-A [3-6]), 2190 (Cr(II)-C [4, 7]) and 2200 cm~1 (Cr(III) [5, 8, 9]). In all three cases the stretching vibration of CO is shifted to a wavenumber higher than that in the undisturbed CO molecule (2143 cm\"1). This means that these sites are attracting electrons. In the case of the Union Carbide type catalysts, IR bands of adsorbed CO have been observed at 2046 and 1974 cm\"1 for chromocene on silica 0304-5102/91/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 174 gel [10] and at 1986 and 1931 cm\"1 for bis(benzene)chromium on AlgOs/ silica gel [11]. Comparing the arithmetic mean of the latter two doublets at 2010 and 1958.5 cm~1 with the results from the Phillips catalyst (2180 cm\"1), it is evident that a large difference in the stretching vibration of adsorbed CO (170 cm~1) exists between the two types of chromium catalysts for the polymerization of ethylene. A possible way to decrease this gap might be to use substituted chromocenes instead of the simple chromocene. The present article reports results with ethyl\", t-butyl-, trimethylsilyl- and phenyl- substituted chromocenes. Experimental l,l'-Bis(ethyl) [12], l,l'-bis(t-butyl) [12], l,l'-bis(trimethylsilyl) [13] and l,l'-bis(phenyl(methyl)) [14] chromocenes are described in the literature and were synthesized by known procedures. The lithiation of chromocene was done in a manner slightly different from that for ferrocene [15]. The authors reacted n-butyllithium in THF at 0 C for 5 h and added ethylbromide or trimethylchlorosilane at 0 C. Thereafter the chromocenes were distilled in high vacuum at elevated temperatures. Mass spectra showed that a roughly 1:2:1 mixture of the 1,1'-disubstituted, the monosubstituted and the unsub- stituted chromocene was formed in a yield of 20%. This mixture was used without further purification. For the IR measurements, a self-supporting disc was pressed from silica gel 60 Merck 7733 (spec. surface: 600 m2 g~1) and mounted on a quartz glass holder, which was placed into a previously described IR cell [16]. The disc was heated to 600 C in vacuum and cooled to room temperature. A toluene solution of the substituted chromocene was splashed under argon onto the disc with the use of a syringe and a polyethylene hose. The IR cell with the impregnated disc was evacuated at 70 C and an IR spectrum recorded. Thereafter CO with a pressure of 80 torr was added and a second IR spectrum was \"obtained. Additional spectra were recorded after some time in order to see how the CO adsorption changed with time. While the disc was usually dark brown or black after reaction of the red chromocene with silica gel for a long time, with the phenyl-substituted chromocene the colour changed from brown to green during some 30 min. This might indicate an oxidation of the chromium to Cr(III) by surface silanol groups, perhaps instead of the replacement of one substituted cyclopentadiene. The FTIR spectra were recorded on Nicolet 20 SXC FTIR spectrometer at 20 C. The spectral resolution was 2 cnr1 and 1024 scans were averaged for every spectrum. The spectra shown below are calculated by subtracting the first spectrum from that recorded with the additional 80 ton\" CO. Results Figure 1 shows the two higher wavenumber IR bands of CO adsorbed on chromium after reaction of the chromocenes with silica gel. For spectrum 175 WAVENUMBERIcm-1! Fig. 1. FTIR spectra of CO adsorbed on different chromocenes after reaction with silica gel. Spectrum A: unsubstituted chromocene; B: ethyl; C: t-butyl; D: trimethylsilyl, and E: phenyl- substituted chromocenes were used. All spectra were adjusted to show a similar peak height. A, unsubstituted chromocene was used and the two bands are at 2047.1 and 1972.2 cm\"1, respectively. Substitution of the chromocene with an ethyl group gave bands at 2039.7 and 1962.4 cm~1 (spectrum B), with t-butyl group bands at 2042.0 and 1965.2 cm\"1 (spectrum C) and with trimethylsilyl group bands at 2041.3 and 1965.9 cm\"1 (spectrum D in Fig. 1), which are all shifted to lower wavenumbers. Substitution with a phenyl group shifted these bands only slightly to lower wavenumbers at 2045.2 and 1971.9 cm~1 (spectrum E). One should note that the band around 1920 cm\"1 is weaker for the t-butyl, trimethylsilyl and phenyl-substituted chromocenes (spectra C, D and E) than for the other two (spectra A and B). Figure 2 shows the three CO IR bands at lower wavenumbers. Here these three bands appear at 1917, 1824 and 1621 cm~1 (spectrum A) for the unsubstituted chromocene. In the case of ethyl substitution, these bands are found at 1915, 1815 and 1615 cm~1 (spectrum B), which means that all are shifted to lower wavenumbers, as was the doublet at higher wavenumbers in Fig. 1. For the t-butyl-substituted chromocene (spectrum C with bands at 1899, 1811 and 1650 cm~1) and the trimethylsilyl one (spectrum D with bands at 1907, 1813 and 1646 cm\"1) it is observed that the splitting of the bands around 1900 and 1650 cm~1 has decreased by some 40 50 cm~1. In the case of the phenyl-substituted chromocene, no CO bands in this region were observed. As already mentioned, the CO IR band around 1900 cm~1 was weaker for the t-butyl- and trimethylsilyl-substituted chromocenes than for the ethyl and unsubstituted ones. In Fig. 3 this becomes more evident with spectra from chromocene (spectra A and B) and t-butyl-substituted chromocene (spectra C and D). Spectra B and D were recorded 45 min after spectra A and C. From these examples it is seen that the two bands from the doublet (2045 and 19 70 cm ~') behave differently in comparison to the lowwavenumber 176 WAVENUMBERfcm-1! Fig. 2. FTIR spectra of CO adsorbed on different chromocenes after reaction with silica gel, but now showing the spectral region with the low wavenumber triplet. The notation of the spectra is the same as in Fig. 1. WAVENUMBER (cm-1) Fig. 3.

In the case of the unsubstituted chromocene, the doublet at higher wavenumbers decreases in intensity after 45 min, while the triplet intensity increases. For the t-butyl-substituted chromocene, the triplet is initially weaker but increases together with the doublet after 45 min. Figure 4 shows spectra of CO IR bands from chromocene (spectrum A), from 1,1'-ethyl-substituted chromocene (spectrum B) and a 1:2:1 mixture of the 1,1'-ethyl, the 1-ethyl and the unsubstituted chromocenes (spectrum 177 WAVENUMBERlcm-l) Fig. 4.

WAVENUMBER Icm-1) Fig. 5. FTIR spectrum of CO adsorbed (spectrum A) on t-butyl chromocene mixture (as in spectrum C, Fig. 4) and its second derivative (spectrum B). C). Note that the CO IR bands from the mixture are almost exactly (at 2044.0 and 1967.9 cm\"1) between those of the other two spectra. The second derivative of the CO IR spectrum from the chromocene mixture (spectrum B in Fig. 5) resolved into three peaks at 2048.5, 2045.4 and 2041.2 cm\"1 for the CO IR band at higher wavenumbers and into four peaks at 1975.4, 1969.8, 1965.9 and 1960.4 cm-1 for the other one. Although strong spectral noise is noted in spectrum B of Fig. 5, one might conclude that the two bands from spectrum A in Fig. 5 contain three doublets. In this case one must neglect the smaller splitting of the two bands at 1969.8 and 1965.9 cm\"' (only 3.9 cm~1 compared to 5.6 and 5.5 cm~1) and assume one band at 1967.9 cm~1. 178 WAVENUMBER(cm-l) Fig. 6.

Figure 6 shows CO IR spectra similar to those in Fig. 5, but here for the trimethylsilyl-substituted chromocenes. In contrast to ethyl substitution in Fig. 5, the mixture with the trimethylsilyl group does not give a CO IR spectrum between that of the other two samples, but only shows a shoulder at lower wavenumbers for both bands. Discussion Figure 7 shows the distance between the two CO IR bands at higher wavenumbers as a function of the arithmetic mean of these two bands for different substituted chromocenes. One can note a tendency for the distance between the two bands to decrease with increasing wavenumbers of the arithmetic mean or, more simply, that with lower electron density the splitting of the two CO IR bands decreases. This is in agreement with the weak splitting of the CO IR bands for the active sites of the Phillips-type catalysts, which have a much lower electron density on the chromium atom and show a separation of only a few wavenumbers (0 5 cm\"1) [3 9]. Indeed, in a drawing including these points (not shown here) a straight line connects these two groups of points. However, bis(benzene)chromium reacted with AlgOa/silica gel does not fit into this general scheme: the splitting of the two CO IR bands here is only 55 cm~1, while the arithmetic mean value of the two bands is 1958.5 cm~1 [11]. Scheme 1 shows a model of the reactions and surface structures [10] that can be used to explain the experimental results described above. Chromocene is known to react with one surface silanol from the silica gel [2], releasing one cyclopentadiene molecule. With the interpretation of the triplet at lower wavenumbers (1920, 1820 and 1620 cm\"1) as due to three 179 t-butyl / ^-ethyl x - '^' chromocene< \"x \\silyl phenyl 2020 20.10 20.00 \"1^2 (cm-1) 2 Fig. 7.

CO molecules bridging between two chromium atoms (structure D in Scheme 1) the authors previously proposed, that most of the chromium atoms are present on the silica gel surface as dinuclear sites [10] (structure B). This should also be true for the catalytically active site of the Union Carbide catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene [10]. The dashed lines between the chromium atoms in structures B, C and D in the scheme shall indicate the presence of a metal-metal bond. Kohler and Geike [13] concluded from NMR measurements that the t- butyl group is electron-releasing and that the trimethylsilyl group is electron- attracting in chromocenes. As noted above, such an effect is not observed 180 after reaction of the substituted chromocenes with silica gel and adsorption of CO. With substituted chromocenes, especially t-butyl and trimethylsilyl, one might expect some steric hindrance to the adsorption of CO on structure B. As previously mentioned, in Figs. 1 and 3 such an effect is indeed observed. This steric effect seems also to be the cause of the decreased splitting of the two bands at 1900 and 1640 cm\"1 in Fig. 2 (structure D in the scheme). From the experiment with the mixture of different ethyl-substituted chromocenes (Figs. 4 and 5), the existence of three different ethyl-substituted surface species with terminally adsorbed CO can be concluded, which can be interpreted as evidence for a dinuclear surface structure also in this case, as shown in Scheme 1 (structure C). Only with such a model can three surface species be formed (with no ethylcp, with one ethylcp and with two ethylcp groups) (cp: cyclopentadienyl). A mononuclear surface structure can form only two species, one with and one without an ethylcp group. Acknowledgement The authors thank the Swedish Energy Administration (SEV) for financial support.
