Modification of carbon support for iron phthalocyanine (FePc) is quite necessary to boost electrocatalytic performance towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), a key process of fuel cells (FCs) as well as metal-air batteries (MABs). Herein, carbon black (CB) was doped with sulphur (S) at high temperature being used as a support for FePc. The prepared FePc/S-doped CB composite was investigated using various characterization techniques. The electrocatalytic ORR activity of the FePc/S-doped CB composite was tested using a rotating disk electrode (RDE) in a 0.1 M KOH solution at room temperature. The ORR polarization curves for FePc/S-doped CB exhibited superior ORR performance in terms of higher onset potentials (0.96 V) and half-wave potentials (0.91 V) compared to FePc/CB (0.83 V and 0.78 V) and the 20 % Pt/C catalyst (0.93 V and 0.86 V), respectively. Theoretical studies elucidated that S-doping improved electronic properties of CB by enhancing its density of states above the Fermi level, thereby facilitating a better electron transfer between FePc and oxygen to facilitate the 4e- ORR pathway. This work demonstrates that with simple structural modifications, including functionalization or doping, CB can be tailored to improve the performance of extended conjugated metal complexes, opening the door for the creation of efficient electrocatalysts for their use in FCs and MABs.

Within this framework, fuel cells (FCs) are one of the emerging technologies [1,2]. However, the high cost and other technological challenges associated with electrode materials and gas diffusion layer assemblies continue to hinder FCs. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the main process in fuel cells (FCs), happening at the cathode, but it is slow, so it needs effective electrocatalysts [3–5]. Although Pt-based catalysts have been considered promising ORR electrocatalysts, their high cost and limited durability hindered their large-scale application [6–8]. Consequently, a lot of research has been conducted on relatively cheap and efficient alternative materials. Because of its unique structure and electronic properties, iron phthalocyanine (FePc) has been looked into as a possible molecular electrocatalyst for ORR [9–11]. However, the electrolytic environment easily degrades FePc due to its molecular nature. Therefore, the concerned scientific community has employed various strategies to boost FePc’s ORR activity as well as stability. Among them, FePc immobilisation on carbon support, like graphene, carbon nanotubes, and carbon black (CB), has been considered a suitable approach to boost its ORR performance [12,13]. Due to excellent surface area, conductivity, and mechanical stability, CB is one of the emerged carbon-based supports for FePc [14,15]. However, the FePc/CB composites have yet to establish their remarkable ORR performance. To make 4e-ORR possible, we need to improve the electronic properties of CB to help FePc to transfer electrons during the ORR process [16]. CB typically lacks a straightforward, stable chemical structure. It is a type of amorphous carbon; hence, its structure is uneven and cannot be definitively described as a crystal lattice, unlike graphite or diamonds. CB particles are ultrafine and originate from the incomplete combustion or pyrolysis of hydrocarbons [17–24]. CB consists of loosely arranged graphitic layers that are primarily aromatic in nature. The layers are made of carbon atoms arranged in hexagonal rings [25], which are similar to graphene but distinctly different from unbroken graphite; these layers are tiny and disorganised. Each carbon atom is covalently connected to three other carbon atoms via sp2 hybridisation [26]; however, the disarray among the layers hinders long-range order. In this study, to enhance the electrical properties, CB was subjected to S-doping via high-temperature treatment. S-doping necessitates significant structural alterations in S-doped CB, therefore influencing the electrical structure [27]. The ORR performance of FePc immobilized on S-doped CB has not been investigated yet. This work aims to utilize S-doped CB as a support for FePc to enhance ORR performance. The key findings about the composite’s structure are (i) FePc was well immobilized on the S-doped CB surface, improving activity, (ii) the synergistic interaction between S-doped CB and FePc improved the electronic structure of active sites, making it easier for electrons to move; and (iii) the nanocrystalline structure of S-doped CB with improved surface area enhanced the accessibility of active sites [28]. The electrocatalytic ORR activity of FePc/S-doped CB composite was found to be superior to FePc/CB, and standard 20 % Pt/C catalysts. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials The materials, including iron phthalocyanine, ethanol, and carbon black (CB) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. All the chemicals were used without any further purification. 2.2 Synthesis of FePc/CB and FePc/S-treated CB composites Typically, 100 mg CB was added to 50 mg FePc containing 20 mL xylene, and the resultant mixture was sonicated for 15 min to make a uniformly dispersed slurry. To achieve good immobilization of FePc over the surface of CB, the obtained slurry was irradiated with microwave radiation of 800 W power for 1 min at 120 °C. The obtained black slurry was centrifuged several times using ethanol and dried at 70 °C for 12 hr in hot-air oven. The obtained black powder was labelled as FePc/CB. Further, to prepare FePc/S-doped CB, 200 mg CB and 50 mg sodium sulphide were mixed and taken under the operation of a mortar pestle to make a uniform mixture. After that the obtained mixture was subjected to pyrolysis in a split tube furnace at 400 °C for 2 hr at the heating rate of 5 °C/min. After that, 50 mg S-treated CB was mixed with 25 mg FePc in 20 mL xylene, and an 800 W power microwave was irradiated for 1 min at 120 °C. Then the obtained slurry was centrifuged with ethanol several times and dried overnight at 70 °C. The obtained black powder was named FePc/S-doped CB. 2.3 Physical measurements To characterize the prepared composites, the analytic techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD) (in the 2θ range of 10–80°, using LabX XRD-6000 Shimadzu X-Ray diffractometer with Cu Kalpha source (λ = 1.54 Å)) and field emission scanning electron microscope (SU 5000-Hitachi) were used. To evaluate the ORR performance of the prepared composites, a triple-electrode system connected with a Pine potentiostat electrochemical instrument was used. A glassy carbon disk (5.0 mm diameter), graphite rod, and Ag/AgCl were used as working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively. To prepare the catalyst ink of the prepared catalysts, 5.0 mg of FePc/S-treated CB, 0.5 mL C2H5OH and 10 μL of 5 wt. % Nafion were mixed and taken under the sonication treatment for 30 min. Typically, 5.0 μL ink of the catalyst was dropped onto the glassy carbon electrode and dried in UV light. The calculated catalyst loading on the GC surface was 0.130 mg cm-2. The prepared electrode was tested for ORR in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte by employing cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry. All the ORR polarization curves were recorded at a 10 mV/s scan rate. ORR polarization curves were also recorded at various rotation rates, including 400, 625, 900, 1225, 1600, and 2025 rpm. The transferred electron number (n) and kinetic current density (J K) were calculated from the Koutecky-Levich (K-L) equation (Eq (1 – 2)) [29,30]. (1) 1 J = 1 J L + 1 J K = 1 B ω 1 / 2 + 1 J K (2) B = 0.62 nF C 0 D 0 2 / 3 υ − 1 / 6 Where, the symbols, J for measured current density, J K for kinetic current density, J L​ for limiting current density, ω for RDE rotation rate, n for the number of electrons transferred, F for the Faraday constant (96,500 C mol−1), C0​ for the O2​ concentration (1.2 × 10−6 mol cm−3), D0​ for the diffusion coefficient (1.9 × 10−5 cm2 s−1), and ν for the kinematic viscosity (0.01 cm2 s−1) in a 0.1 mol L −1 KOH electrolyte, were used in Eq (1 – 2). We conducted stability testing of the FePc/S-doped CB sample by performing 5000 CV cycles within a potential window of 0 to −1 V (vs Ag/AgCl) in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH at a scan rate of 50 mV/s. To assess stability, we recorded the LSV curve at a scan rate of 10 mV/s and 1600 rpm rotation rate after conducting 5000 CV cycles and compared it with the LSV curve obtained before these cycles. The double-layer capacitance (Cdl) values for the FePc/CB and FePc/S-doped composites were obtained from CV tests done between 0.99–1.15 V (vs. RHE), where there were no major redox reactions. Several CV scans were recorded at various scan rates (10–100 mV/s), and the capacitive current was recorded at a constant voltage in the double-layer area. The current values are plotted against the scan rates, and the slope of the straight line gives the Cdl value using the equation i=Cdl⋅v, where i is the capacitive current and ν is the scan rate. The potentials measured with respect to Ag/AgCl were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale using the following equation (Eq. (3)). (3) ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 pH + E0 Ag/AgCl 2.4 Theoretical studies A 3 × 3 carbon sheet was used to make the structural model of FePc/CB and FePc/ S-doped CB. This sheet created a number of functional groups, such as –COOH, –OH, and –CO. For S-doped CB, we doped S-atoms into the CB matrix. In order to construct the structural models of the FePc/CB and FePc/S-doped CB, we immobilised the FePc molecule on the CB and S-doped CB, respectively. We conducted the density functional theory (DFT) investigations using the Quantum ESPRESSO package under the advanced plane-wave pseudopotential approach. The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional, with its generalised gradient approximation (GGA), was utilised for all calculations to ensure an accurate representation of electron exchange and correlation effects. We further optimised the constructed structures of the prepared models by using ultrasoft pseudopotentials for all components to accurately represent their electrical interactions. The plane-wave basis set, which utilised kinetic energy cutoff of 50 Ry for wave functions and 450 Ry for charge density, facilitated an accurate representation of the electronic states. A Monkhorst-Pack grid of size 8 × 8 × 10 was used to sample the Brillouin zone [31]. This gave a good picture of the unit cell's electronic structure, and SCF convergence was carefully controlled to a level of accuracy of 10⁻5 eV. Extensive convergence tests were conducted to validate the results and improve the dependability of the computations, emphasising parameters such as plane-wave cut-off energy, K-point grid resolution, and vacuum thickness in the surface models. The non-spin-polarized DFT calculations yielded a thorough examination of the density of states (DOS) and projected density of states (PDOS), elucidating the electronic structure and the roles of various atomic orbitals in the material's overall electronic state [32]. The charge density distribution was thoroughly examined to investigate electron localisation and charge transfer mechanisms between atoms in the S-treated CB and FePc systems. The charge density difference was calculated using Eq. (4). (4) Δ ρ ( Density Difference ) = ρ ( A d d u c t ) − ρ ( c a t a l y s t ) − − ρ ( i n t e r m e d i a t e ) The adsorption energies of the ORR-adducts were calculated using the following Eq. (5), whereas, Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for ORR intermediates was computed using Eq. (6) [33]. (5) Δ E a d s . = ( E A d d u c t ) − ( E c a t a l y s + E I n t e r m e d i a t e ) (6) Δ G = Δ E + Δ Z P E − T Δ S − n e U + k T l n 10 × Δ p H Where, E c a t a l y s t − I n t e r m e d i a t e , E c a t a l y s t , and E I n t e r m e d i a t e are the energies of Intermediate-adduct, catalyst, and Intermediate, respectively. Δ G , Δ Z P E , and T Δ S , and ΔE represents the reaction energies, zero-point energy, and entropy variation, whereas, n, U, and T are the electron transfer number, electrode potential, and temperature, respectively. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of prepared composites To gain insight into the material's structure and performance, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electrochemical techniques were utilized. To demonstrate the crystal structure and phase purity of the prepared FePc/CB and FePc/S-doped CB composites, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique was utilized. Fig. 1 a showed the XRD pattern of CB, FePc/CB, S-doped CB, and FePc/S-doped FePc samples. The XRD pattern for S-doped CB showed only slight changes in some peak positions and a decrease in peak intensity (represented by *), indicating that S-atoms were successfully doped to CB [34–37]. The XRD pattern for FePc showed two main peaks (represented by #) at 11.2° and 16.9°, which were also present with the characteristics of CB and S-doped CB in the FePc/CB and FePc/S-doped CB composites, respectively, showing that FePc was successfully mixed into CB and S-doped CB without creating any new substances or impurities. The XRD pattern for FePc showed two main peaks at 11.2° and 16.9°, which were also present in the FePc/CB and FePc/S-doped CB composites, showing that FePc was successfully incorporated to CB and S-doped CB without creating any new substances or impurities. To examine the defects and structural changes in CB after S-doping, Raman studies were conducted for both the CB and S-doped CB. Raman spectra of both CB and S-doped CB displayed two main peaks near 1345 cm-1 and 1582 cm-1, which can be ascribed to the d-band and G-band, respectively (Fig. 1 b). The d-band, as related to sp²-hybridized carbon, is indicative of disorder or defect structures. The G band represents the in-plane vibrations of the graphitic carbon atoms. The relative intensities (ID/IG) provide some means of quantifying the defect density. The results showed that after S-doping to CB, the strength of the d-band increased, leading to a higher ID/IG ratio of 1.05 compared to 0.99 for CB, which means that S-doping created more defects or distortions in the original carbon structure of CB. S-doping influenced the electronic structure of CB and enhanced its electrical conductivity. Enhanced electrical conductivity can allow for increased electron transfer from the FePc active sites to the conductive support, which can promote the ORR kinetics. The defects created in CB due to S-doping can also act as anchoring points for the FePc molecules during deposition to assure greater dispersion and interaction between FePc and CB support, which can reduce FePc aggregation and result in more active, exposed FeN4 centres. Moreover, the electron-rich, S-doped CB support can alter the electronic density of the Fe centre through its interaction with the FePc. Furthermore, we analysed these materials using the XPS technique to examine the surface elemental content and bonding configuration in the FePc/CB and the FePc/S-doped CB. The XPS scan for N1s in both the FePc/CB and FePc/S-doped CB showed nearly the same peaks for the types of nitrogen (pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N) in FePc [38–41]. However, the peaks were less intense for the FePc/S-doped CB than for the FePc/CB composite (Fig. 1 c). The Fe2p XPS scans for both the FePc/CB and FePc/S-doped CB showed similar patterns, but the peaks for the Fe2p singles (2p3/2 and 2p1/2 orbitals of the Fe2+ state) were weaker in the FePc/S-doped CB composite (Fig. 1 d). The reduced peak intensity of the Fe 2p and N 1 s XPS signals for FePc/S-doped CB may be due to stronger coupling or electronic delocalization between FePc and the S-doped CB, suggesting enhanced electronic interaction between FePc and S-doped CB. Furthermore, the XPS survey for both the FePc/CB and FePc/S-doped CB showed signals that revealed what elements are present in them (Figures S1-S2). The presence of a pronounced O 1 s XPS peak in these samples may occur as a result of (i) surface oxidation; carbon-containing materials (such as CB and S-doped CB) are prone to surface oxidation, particularly during synthesis or exposure to air, contributing to a signal for O 1 s; and (ii) with FePc molecules, oxygen could exist as physiosorbed or coordinated species at the Fe centre of FePc during processing. The peaks at about 780 eV in the XPS survey might be associated with the Fe 2p3/2 core level, a distinctive feature of Fe in FePc, and signify the presence of Fe in either a + 2 or +3 oxidation state, which is most commonly observed in FePc and its composites. Moreover, the peak at about 950 eV in the XPS survey peak can most probably be associated with the Cu 2p1/2, suggesting possible trace contamination from copper sources, either from the experimental apparatus (e.g., sample holders, sputtering targets, etc.). Additionally, we conducted SEM analyses to examine the morphological and compositional characteristics of CB and S-doped CB. Figs. 1 e and 1 f showed the SEM images of CB and S-doped CB, illustrating their spherical nanoparticles with diameters ranging from 40 to 50 nm. Figures S3 and S4 showed the elemental compositions of CB and S-doped CB, confirming the presence of carbon and oxygen in CB, and carbon, oxygen, and sulphur in S-doped CB, respectively. Further, the morphological characteristic of the prepared FePc/CB and FePc/S-treated CB composites were carried out with TEM investigations. Fig. 2 displays the TEM images and HAADF imaging, which provide compositional maps of the FePc/CB and FePc/S-doped CB composites. The HAADF imaging together with the element mapping of FePc/S-doped CB clearly indicated successful incorporation of FePc with CB and S-doped CB. The S-doped CB has significantly altered the way FePc interacts with the carbon support, leading to better electron transfer and surface interaction at that interface [42], and thereby improving ORR performance. 3.2 Electrocatalytic ORR performance evaluation The synthesized FePc/CB, and FePc/S-doped CB composites were subjected to electrochemical tests in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution to assess their performance in ORR, using CV and LSV techniques. First, the CVs of FePc/CB and FePc/S-treated CB composites were recorded at a 50 mV/s scan rate. The results clearly indicated that both the composites displayed two redox couples at +0.34 V and +0.73 V (vs RHE), which can be attributed to the Fe+/Fe2+ and Fe2+/Fe3+ redox processes [43,44]. For ORR response, FePc/CB composite did not display clear ORR peak. The absence of a clear ORR peak can be attributed to a higher current of Fe2+/Fe3+, which diluted the appearance of ORR peak. However, FePc/S-treated CB composite clearly showed an ORR response peak at +0.91 V (Fig. 3 a). Further, the LSVs for both the composites along with 20 % Pt/C were recorded in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution at a 10 mV/s scan rate and 1600 rpm to compare their activity. The FePc/S-doped CB composite showed excellent ORR activity, with a half-wave potential (E 1/2) of 0.91 V, which is better than the FePc/CB composite at 0.77 V and 20 % Pt/C at 0.86 V (Fig. 3 b). This improvement in ORR activity of FePc/S-doped CB can be attributed to the doping of S-atoms in CB, which synergistically influenced the electron transfer between FePc and O2 during ORR. Further, the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) measurements were carried out to study the catalyst’s active site exposure or to examine the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) for the prepared FePc/CB and FePc/S-doped CB catalysts. The Cdl values for these catalysts were calculated by performing cyclic voltammetry in a narrow potential window to not include any pseudocapacitance contributions (Figures S5-S6). As shown in Figure S7, the calculated Cdl values for the FePc/CB and FePc/S-doped CB samples were 20 and 11 mF/cm², respectively. Fig. 3 c showed LSV curves of FePc/S-treated CB composite recorded at different rotation rates, which were used to assess electron transfer number during ORR, employing K-L equations. The K-L plots exhibited good linearity at various potentials (Figure S8), suggesting first-order kinetics with respect to dissolved oxygen and that the number of electrons transferred remains constant during the ORR process [32,33]. Based on K-L equations [34], the number of electron transfers (n) and the kinetic current density were calculated. The slope (1/B) was determined for the 1/J versus ω⁻1/2 plots, which showed an electron transfer number of about 3.99, suggesting that the 4e- ORR pathway was involved. Moreover, the onset potential of +0.96 V (vs RHE), electron transfer number (n = 3.99), and kinetic current density (Jₖ = 4.54 mA cm⁻² at 0.85 V) demonstrated by FePc/S-doped CB catalysts indicated an enhanced catalytic performance compared to commercial 20 % Pt/C. These results showed that ORR process at FePc/S-doped CB optimally involved four electrons to directly reduce O2 to water (H2O). In addition, FePc/S-doped CB composite exhibits a smaller Tafel slope (82 mV dec⁻¹) compared to FePc/CB (93 mV dec⁻¹) and commercial 20 % Pt/C (88 mV dec⁻¹), suggesting more favourable oxygen reduction kinetics and a lower activation overpotential on the FePc/S-treated CB surface (Fig. 3 d). Additionally, the FePc/S-doped CB composite kept its E 1/2 value the same but decreased by 0.76 mA/cm² in current density after 5000 CV cycles, showing it has a moderate level of stability in the tested conditions (Fig. 3 e). Furthermore, FePc/S-doped CB composite maintained its E 1/2 value constant but lost 0.19 mA/cm2 current density after addition of 5 mL methanol in O2-saturatd 0.1 M KOH solution, indicating its remarkable methanol tolerance (Fig. 3 f). In order to determine whether the Fe-N4 sites in the synthesized FePc/S-doped CB composite are the only sites of activity, we added a small amount of KSCN to the electrolyte with the same experimental procedure. The CV and LSV curves (Figures S9–S10) suggested a significant decrease in ORR performance as was expected, likely due to Fe competing with SCN⁻ ions that can form coordination bonds that sterically block O2 molecules. These results therefore indicated that the Fe-N4 moieties can act as the primary active sites in the FePc/S-doped CB catalyst, and they are very vulnerable to SCN⁻ poisoning [45]. 3.3 DFT calculations In order to explore the mechanism of ORR with FePc/CB and FePc/S-doped CB, we conducted theoretical investigations using DFT calculations. First of all, we optimised the FePc/CB and FePc/S-doped CB structures, and the most stable optimized FePc/CB and FePc/S-treated CB geometries are shown in Fig. 4 (a-d). We computed the charge density difference to further check the electronic redistribution over the S-treated CB and FePc/S-doped CB. Fig. 4(e-f) showed the difference in charge density between the S-doped CB, FePc/CB, and FePc/S-doped CB. It was clear that adding S-atoms to the CB increased the electron density over the CB, which made it easier for electrons to move between FePc and the S-treated CB [46]. This finding is a strong indication that S-doped support improved the electronic communication between FePc and S-doped CB, thereby improving the ORR activity. Moreover, it is well known that material's density of states (DOS) is associated with their electronic features. So, to see how the density of states of CB changed when S was added, the DOS of CB, S-doped CB, FePc, FePc/CB, and FePc/S-doped CB was calculated (Fig. 5 (a-e)). The results showed that adding S to CB increased the DOS above the Fermi level, making S-treated CB more conductive than untreated CB. So, S-doped CB greatly increased the DOS over the Fermi level for the FePc/S-doped CB composite, which made it more electrically conductive overall. These results strongly suggested that adding S to CB had a big effect on the electronic properties of the FePc and gave it the ability to speed up ORR. Further, we optimized all the ORR intermediates (*OOH, O, and OH) systematically over FePc, FePc/CB, and FePc/S-doped CB (Fig. 6 a). The results indicated that O2 molecules were optimally adsorbed in the initial step, and in the last step, *OH was easily detached from the Fe-site of the FePc/S-doped CB composite, as compared to FePc and FePc/CB, leading to 4e- ORR activity for FePc/S-doped CB (Fig. 6 b). The unique behaviour of FePc/S-doped CB can be attributed to the doping of S-atoms into CB, which influenced the binding energy of the Fe-site for O-species during ORR [33]. 4 Conclusion This work used carbon black (CB), sulphur-doped by high-temperature treatment, as a conductive carbon support for FePc. Investigations using XRD, Raman, XPS, SEM and TEM confirmed the S-doping into CB and immobilization of FePc over the CB and S-doped CB. We further tested the obtained FePc/S-doped CB composite for electrocatalytic ORR activity. FePc/S-doped CB composite displayed a higher onset potential (0.96 V) and a higher half-wave potential (0.91 V) than FePc/CB (0.83 V and 0.78 V, respectively) and the 20 % Pt/C catalyst (0.93 V and 0.86 V), demonstrating its superior ORR activity. In addition, FePc/S-doped composite also showed remarkable methanol tolerance and durability, making it a promising material for the ORR process. The theoretical calculations indicated that sulphur doping enhanced CB's electrical characteristics by raising its density of states above the Fermi level. This improved electron transport between FePc and oxygen allowed for 4e-ORR. This study highlights the possibility that altering CB with heteroatoms can influence its inherent electronic structure and be used as promising carbon support for extended π-conjugation-containing macrocyclic molecules to accelerate the kinetics of sluggish catalytic reactions.

        "dc:description": "Modification of carbon support for iron phthalocyanine (FePc) is quite necessary to boost electrocatalytic performance towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), a key process of fuel cells (FCs) as well as metal-air batteries (MABs). Herein, carbon black (CB) was doped with sulphur (S) at high temperature being used as a support for FePc. The prepared FePc/S-doped CB composite was investigated using various characterization techniques. The electrocatalytic ORR activity of the FePc/S-doped CB composite was tested using a rotating disk electrode (RDE) in a 0.1 M KOH solution at room temperature. The ORR polarization curves for FePc/S-doped CB exhibited superior ORR performance in terms of higher onset potentials (0.96 V) and half-wave potentials (0.91 V) compared to FePc/CB (0.83 V and 0.78 V) and the 20 % Pt/C catalyst (0.93 V and 0.86 V), respectively. Theoretical studies elucidated that S-doping improved electronic properties of CB by enhancing its density of states above the Fermi level, thereby facilitating a better electron transfer between FePc and oxygen to facilitate the 4e- ORR pathway. This work demonstrates that with simple structural modifications, including functionalization or doping, CB can be tailored to improve the performance of extended conjugated metal complexes, opening the door for the creation of efficient electrocatalysts for their use in FCs and MABs.",
