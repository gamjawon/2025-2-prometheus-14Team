MIRBACH* and MARLIS F. MIRBACH Universitat Duisburg GH, Fachbereich 6, Angewandte Chemie, Lotharstrasse 63, D-4100 Duisburg (F.R.G.) (Received March 10, 1982) Summary The catalytic activity of RhC^ and RhHCO(PPh3)3 towards hydro- formylation, hydrogenation and isomerization of olefins such as 1-octene, styrene, 1,5- and 2,4-hexadiene is enhanced by UV-irradiation. The most active photocatalytic system consists of Rhd3 and norbomadiene, which catalyses the hydroformylation of 1-octene even at room temperature. The photochemical reaction of norbomadiene itself at 80 bar CO/H; and 20 C lead to a copolymer between norbomadiene and carbon monoxide, in contrast to the thermal reaction at 80 bar CO/H^ and 80 C which results in the formation of mono- and dialdehydes. A UV-autoclave allowing photo- chemical reactions at pressures up to 300 bar is described. Introduction It has been shown recently that high pressure photochemistry can be an efficient tool to activate carbon monoxide and hydrogen in homoge- neous catalytic reactions. UV-irradiation of ionic cobalt catalysts resulted not only in higher reaction rates for the hydroformylation of olefins (eqn. 1), but also led to extremely high selectivities of linear oxo-products [1, 2]. For example, 99% n-butyraldehyde was obtained in the hydroformylation of propene [1]. Other examples of photocatalytic reaction under high pressure include the hydrogenation of dienes with chromium carbonyls [3] or the hydroformylation of olefins with iron pentacarbonyl [4]. , CO/Hi,hr R-CH=CH-R' ^ R CH-CH2-R + R-CHz-CH-R' (1) catalyst 1 I CHO CHO Dedicated to Prof. Dr. F.

Results With a catalytic system consisting of RhC^- SH^O and norbornadiene (NBD), it is possible to hydroformylate 1-octene at room temperature when the mixture is irradiated (eqn. 2). No reaction occurs in the dark (Table 1).

C9-esters are formed via a hydroesterification reaction. Its importance decreases with increasing pressure of synthesis gas. A minimum pressure of ~20 bar CO/H2 is required to stabilize the catalytic system. At 10 bar (run 3, Table 1) the catalyst was decomposed during the reaction and was recovered as Rh metal. Norbornadiene is neces- sary only in catalytic amounts. It remains more or less unchanged until most of the octene is converted. At high conversions of 1-octene the nor- bornadiene reacts with CO/H2 to give norbornenealdehyde dimethylacetal and some norbornadiene CO copolymer (Fig. 1). When rhodium chloride together with triphenyl phosphine and 1- octene are irradiated without added norbornadiene, the catalytic activity is much lower and the octene is mainly hydrogenated. Also in this case no reaction occurs in the dark at room temperature (Table 2). RhHCO(PPh3)3 catalyzes the hydroformylation of 1-octene and styrene even at room temperature, but only to a very minor extent (Table 2). Addi- tional irradiation increases the catalytic activity significantly. However, this enhanced activity is unselective, which means that side reactions such 119 TABLE 1 Photochemical hydroformylation of 1-octene with a RhCl3/norbornadiene catalyst Run no. 12345 hv P (bar) ald-lb (molTo)0 ald-S0 (mol%) acetal-l (mol%) acetal^ (mol%) ester-^ (mol%) ester-2f (mol%) other Cc-isomers (mol%) NBD-oxo-productsg + 100.6 1.2 + 3517 7 8 3 20 + 75 1 0.5 12 16 6 1 3 + 75 75' 3 -1 30 40 -13 -3 -4 -70 Conditions: 0.6 M 1-octene; 0.03 M norbornadiene (NBD); 0.015 M RhCIs'Sii^O; 22 C; 3.5 h reaction time. \"21 h reaction time.

The yield of hydrogenation products is not very reproducible, and they are probably formed via heterogeneous catalysis due to photochem- ically-formed insoluble rhodium species. The results for 1,5-hexadiene are similar to those for the mono-olefins (Table 3). The hydroformylation yields are 2.6 times higher under photo- chemical conditions than without irradiation. The major photochemical reaction, however, is isomerisation to conjugated dienes, especially 1,3- hexadiene. For 2,4-hexadiene no hydroformylation is observed and iso- merisation is the only process which occurs (Table 3). Norbomadiene as the substrate (in the absence of other olefins) ex- hibits a peculiar behaviour with both catalysts, RhCl3 and RhH(CO)(PPh3)3. At room temperature the reaction without irradiation is very slow, leading to 10% conversion after 22 h (Table 4 k). At 80 C, however, all of the NBD can be converted to oxo products (Table 4 q). The only products are norbomene aldehyde and norbornane dialdehyde, as one would expect for a normal hydroformylation reaction (eqn. 2). Irradiation of the reaction mixture leads to strongly enhanced catalyst reactivity, but the monomeric hydroformylation products are formed only to a minor degree. The predominant products are now oligomers and co- polymers between norbornadiene and carbon monoxide (eqn. 2). The copolymer formation is photocatalytic, which means that products are formed during periods of irradiation. When the light is turned off after 10 h of irradiation, only a minor increase in product yield is observed in a consecutive 15 h dark period (Table 4 c + e). The conversion is increased with increasing carbon monoxide pressure (Table 4 d, h, i). On the other hand, neither the starting catalyst (RhCIa or RhHCO(PPh3)3) nor the presence of an excess of PPh3 has a significant in- fluence on the conversion and the product distribution (Table 4 d, e, m, n). ^H OHC^-7 ^-Ly + /J^ycHo ^0% 60% (2) NBD-CO-copolymer + -90% -10% Under similar conditions (20 \"G, 80 bar CO/T^) the complex Rr^Clz- (00)4 did not show any catalytic activity for the conversion of NBD.

Discussion Both the catalyst precursors investigated m this work are activated by UV irradiation. The photochemical reaction pathways are different from what would be expected for thermal reactions. 122 RhClySH^O The RhCl3/NBD system is most interesting, because it catalyzes the hydroformylation of octene-1 with a considerable catalytic activity even at room temperature. Another remarkable feature is the pressure dependence of the photochemical reaction. At pressures below 20 bar, the catalytic system is unstable and decomposes with formation of rhodium metal. At low synthesis gas pressures (e.g. 30 bar) the major products are carboxylic acid esters, which means the intermediate acyi complex reacts predomin- antly with methanoi to give the hydroesterification product. With increasing pressure the hydrogenolysis of the acyi complex becomes more and more competitive. The resulting aldehydes react further with methanoi to yield the corresponding dimethyl acetals, probably catalyzed by the HC1 formed in the reduction of the RhC^.

Conditions, see Table 1; (a) total product yield; (b) yield of hydro- formylation products; (c) yield of hydroesterification products. Rhodium chloride catalyzes the reaction of CO/ii^ with olefins to a significant extent only when norbornadiene is present and when the solution is irradiated. Furthermore, triphenylphosphine does not alter the reaction and there is no carbon monoxide-containing rhodium compound detectable when the reaction is interrupted. A reaction pathway as summarized in Scheme 1 seems logical: 123 RhCl, 3H,0 hv' 'Hc1 > [Rh(NBD)U)-, J L NBD,-H, ,, t \\ hv Scheme 1 The mechanism in Scheme 1 is consistent with literature data [6 - 9], but it is of course speculative until further mechanistic investigations are carried out. RhHCO(PPh^)^ The reactivity of this classical hydroformylation catalyst is enhanced by UV irradiation [10], but in a rather unselective way, and it does not equal the activity of the RhC^/norbornadiene system, except in the con- version of norbornadiene. In the thermal hydroformylation, RhHCO(PPh)3)3 in the presence of excess phosphine leads with high selectivity to linear aldehydes, without isomerisation of the starting olefin or diene [11, 12]. This is different in the photochemical reaction. With dienes, isomerisation is the major process and with olefins, in particular with styrene, formation of branched oxo-products is observed. Therefore we conclude that there is at least one photochemical reaction which is different from the normal thermal pathway. A reasonable assumption seems the formation of the paramagnetic 'Rh(CO)(PPh3), either directly from the hydride or from an intermediate dimer. Consecutive reversible formation of a w-allyl complex can explain the observed hydrogenation and isomerisation. Spectroscopic investigations are under way to verify the proposed mechanism (Scheme 2).
