Department of Pharmaceutical Engineering, School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, Tianjin University Tianjin 300350 China Glucose isomerization into fructose is the dominant reaction path for biomass conversion. Lewis acidic aluminum or tin were firstly impregnated in microporous UiO-66 for remarkably enhanced glucose isomerization. Al@UiO-66 achieved 37.5% fructose yield with a 63.9% selectivity with no obvious leaching of aluminum while Sn@UiO-66 failed the leaching test. The 27Al NMR and XPS spectra of Al@UiO-66 demonstrated the complex environment of aluminum in UiO-66 involving the chains of aluminum octahedra and the Al–O–C structure, which contributed to the enhanced Lewis acidity and promoted performance of the catalyst.

To cope with these challenges has stimulated great interest towards renewable energy sources. Because of the renewability and widespread distribution, biomass energy has been demonstrated to be a sustainable alternative of non-renewable fossil fuels, which can be transformed into biofuels for transportation or converted into a range of high value-added chemicals[2]. The utilization of biomass source can be achieved through platform compounds including C6 and C5 sugars[3–5]. Glucose as the most abundant monosaccharide, its isomerization to fructose is an indispensable step in converting platform compounds into a variety of downstream products. In addition, the industrial production of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) also comes from partial isomerization of glucose into fructose. Immobilized enzymes have been traditionally used as industrial catalysts for glucose isomerization to fructose[6,7]. In addition, Lewis acidic metal chlorides have been extensively researched as homogeneous catalysts, such as CrCl2 [8], SnCl4 [9] and AlCl3 [10–12]. But it is worth to mention that the disadvantages inherent in traditional biological enzymes and homogeneous acids, such as high cost, low stability, poor repeatability and separation difficulty, still limit their practical applications at a large industrial scale. Instead, heterogeneous catalysts have emerged as promising substitutes including zeolites[13,14] and metal–organic frameworks[15] through combining their robust structure with Lewis acidic metals. Manuel et al. have proved that Sn-beta zeolite can effectively convert glucose into fructose in water[16]. By doping reactive aluminum/tin sites into the MCM-41 with spacious mesochannels and good hydrothermal stability, stronger Lewis acidity and enhanced substrate transport was achieved for high catalytic activity toward glucose-to-fructose isomerization[17,18]. Compared to conventional zeolites, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) built from metal ions or clusters and bridging organic ligands have drawn significant attention as catalysts or catalyst supports[19,20] due to their versatile structural tunability, remarkable surface area and abundant active sites. Trinuclear chromium cluster based MIL-101-SO3H with both Lewis and Brønsted acidic sites exhibited a fructose yield of 21.6% with glucose conversion of 78%[21]. Taking advantage of the Lewis acidity of homogeneous ytterbium chloride, a robust ytterbium-based MOF was constructed to convert glucose into 5-hydroxymethylfurfural via fructose, with a glucose conversion of 27.6%, a 5-HMF yield of 17.8% and a 5-HMF selectivity of 64.5%[22]. Through acid modulation, defective UiO-66 constructed with Zr6 cluster and terephthalate ligand achieved a high fructose selectivity of 72% in 1-PrOH where Zr6 clusters could act as acidic sites as a result of the defective synthesis[23]. Even though considerable efforts have been devoted into the heterogenous catalysts, using MOFs as catalysts support for the deposition of Lewis acidic or basic sites remains non-trivial. Ultrastable UiO-66 as the first Zr6-based MOFs linked by terephthalate, has been extensively studied as catalyst support due to its structural robustness and high porosity [24]. Incorporating Ti into UiO-66 tremendously improved the photocatalytic properties of UiO-66 [25]. Metalating UiO-66 with VV displayed high selectivity for benzene in the vapor-phase oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexene[26]. Yu et al. prepared UiO-66 supported CuO-CeO2 which exhibited high activity for low temperature oxidation of carbon monoxide[27]. Han et al. used UiO-66 as supports to prepare Rh-Mn catalysts which exhibited good CO hydrogenation performance[28]. In consideration of the extensive investigation of UiO-66 as catalyst supports as well as the Lewis acidity of homogenous aluminum Al(Ⅲ)[10–12] and tin Sn(Ⅳ) ions[29], we incorporated aluminum and tin into the framework of UiO-66 structure through impregnation where increased Lewis acidity was achieved with accordingly enhanced performance for glucose isomerization. 2 Experimental methods 2.1 Materials All chemicals and solvents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification including anhydrous zirconium(IV) chloride (98%, Innochem, Beijing, China), hydrochloric acid (36 ~ 38%, Yuanli, Tianjin, China), terephthalic acid (> 99.0%, TCI, Shanghai, China), sulfuric acid (95.0 ~ 98.0%, Rionlon, Tianjin, China), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (> 99.5%, Macklin, Shanghai, China), acetone (≥ 99.5%, Rionlon, Tianjin, China), ethanol (≥ 99.7%, Rionlon, Tianjin, China), tin chloride pentahydrate (SnCl4.5 H2O) (> 99%, Aladdin, Shanghai, China), aluminum chloride hexahydrate (AlCl3.6 H2O) (≥ 97%, Bodi, Tianjin, China), 1-propyl alcohol (1-PrOH) (> 99.5%, Macklin, Shanghai, China), D-glucose (GR, Macklin, Shanghai, China), D-fructose (> 99%, Macklin, Shanghai, China) and deionized (DI) water. 2.2 Synthesis of Sn@UiO-66s and Al@UiO-66s UiO-66 was synthesized according to the literature[30]. The activated UiO-66 powder (50 mg) was placed in a 20 mL thick-walled glass vial and a solution of SnCl4.5H2O or AlCl3.6H2O in DMF (4 mL) was added. The vial was sealed, then placed in oven at 100 °C overnight. After the reaction, the product was washed with fresh DMF solution until it was colorless, then soaked in acetone overnight and washed for three times. Vacuum drying was carried out at 120 °C for 12 h to obtain the catalysts denoted as 0.1Al@UiO-66, 0.2Al@UiO-66, 0.1Sn@UiO-66 and 0.2Sn@UiO-66 where 0.1 and 0.2 represent the concentration of the impregnation solutions. 2.3 Synthesis of Sn@UiO-66 and Al@UiO-66 single crystals UiO-66 single crystals were synthesized according to the literature[31]. After solvent exchange with fresh DMF, UiO-66 single crystals were then exposed to the solution of SnCl4 or AlCl3 in DMF (0.1 M, 4 mL) overnight at 100 °C. The tin/aluminum-impregnated single crystals were washed with fresh DMF prior to the single crystal X-ray diffraction. 2.4 Catalyst characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the samples were investigated by a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer model Smart lab equipped with a 9 kW Cu-Kα1 X-ray radiation (λ = 0.154056 nm) rotating anode with 2θ angle ranging from 5° to 40°. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out with a Apreo S LoVac electron microscope operated at 5.0 kV where the samples were precoated with platinum. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs and elemental mapping were recorded on a JEM-F200 with an EDX detector operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Nitrogen sorption isotherms on activated materials were performed on the 3 H-2000PM2 volumetric adsorption instrument at −196 °C. Prior to the measurement, the samples were degassed for 8 h at 160 °C. Pore size distributions were obtained using density functional theory (DFT) calculations using a carbon slit-pore model with a N2 kernel. The specific surface areas were determined using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) model from the N2 sorption data in the region P/P 0 = 0.005 ~ 0.05. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) was carried out to determine the amount of tin and aluminum in the samples with the Agilent 725 ES instrument. Ammonium temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) was performed on AutoChem II 2920 equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for the acidity of the catalysts. Around 50 mg of the material was heated from room temperature to 120 °C at 10 °C /min under air atmosphere, then purged with helium flow at 30 mL/min for 2 h before being cooled to 50 °C. The sample was exposed to 10% NH3/He mixture for 1 h for saturation and then purged with helium flow at 30 mL/min for 1 h to remove the weakly physiosorbed NH3. The desorption profile of ammonia was recorded with the sample being heated to 700 °C at 10 °C /min under helium atmosphere. The 27Al spectrum of 0.1Al@UiO-66 was obtained at 10 kHz high-power proton decoupling (HPEDC) in single pulse experiment, with relaxation delay of 0.5 s by a Bruker Avance II 600 spectrometer. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were collected using a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha spectrometer with Al Kα radiation (300 W, 15 kV, 1486.6 eV) with a multi-channel detector. Spectra of samples were recorded in the constant pass energy mode at 50 eV, using a 400 µm diameter analysis area. The XPS spectra were corrected with the C1s binding energy value of 284.8 eV. 2.5 Catalytic reaction The catalytic reaction in this work was based on the two-step procedure[32]. A 20 mL thick-walled glass vial was loaded with 7 mg catalyst and a pre-determined D-glucose solution (40 mg in 5 mL 1-PrOH). The vial was sealed with the crimp cap (PTFE/silicone membrane) and purged with N2 for 2 min, then stirred in an oil bath at 90 °C. The catalysis was terminated by filtering off the catalyst and by adding deionized water (5 mL) the filtrate was proceeded for hydrolysis at 90 °C for 24 h prior to the product analysis by HPLC. The catalytic product was analyzed by an LC3000 high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system equipped with a refractive index detector and an Aminex HPX-87 H column (Bio-Rad, ø: 7.8 × 300 mm, mobile phase: 5 mM sulfuric acid aqueous solution, flow rate: 0.6 mL/min, column temperature: 50 °C). The experimental result was the average of three measurements. The glucose conversion, fructose yield and selectivity in the product were calculated in terms of the carbon content. (1) Glucose conversion ( mol % ) = G l u i - G l u p ( mg ⋅ mL - 1 ) G l u i ( mg ⋅ mL - 1 ) × 100 (2) Fructose yield ( mol % ) = F r u p ( mg ⋅ mL − 1 ) G l u i ( mg ⋅ mL − 1 ) × 100 (3) Fru ctose selectivity ( mol % ) = F r u p ( mg ⋅ mL − 1 ) G l u i − G l u p ( mg ⋅ mL − 1 ) × 100 where Glu i (mg/mL) represents the initial glucose concentration; Glu p and Fru p (mg/mL) represent the concentration of glucose and fructose in the product, respectively. The rate of fructose formation normalized by acid sites was calculated by following formula: (4) Rate of fructose formation normalized by acid sites = F r u p ( mg ⋅ mL − 1 ) × V ( mL ) / M Fru ( mol ⋅ g - 1 ) m a s s o f c a t a l y s t ( g ) × a c i d i t y ( mmol ⋅ g − 1 ) × T i m e ( h ) where acidity represents the total acidity of the catalyst characterized by NH3-TPD. 2.6 Leach test Leaching experiment was performed under selected conditions. In the leaching experiment, the catalyst was filtered out with a 0.45 µm filter membrane after 5 h of the reaction, and the filtrate continued reacting for extended time which was sampled at 8 h, 12 h and 24 h. The samples were further hydrolyzed by adding deionized water at 90 °C for 24 h prior to the product analysis by HPLC. 2.7 Stability test In order to evaluate the stability of the Al@UiO-66 catalyst, the catalyst was recovered after the reaction, washed with water for three times, then soaked in acetone overnight and washed with acetone for another three times. Muffle furnace was used to heat the catalyst at 200 °C for 4 h. The solid was dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C overnight prior to being reused for the next run. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst characterization Tin chloride pentahydrate and aluminum chloride hexahydrate were used as precursors to prepare the UiO-66-supported Lewis acid catalysts (denoted as 0.1Al@UiO-66, 0.2Al@UiO-66, 0.1Sn@UiO-66 and 0.2Sn@UiO-66) by solvothermal deposition in MOFs (SIM). The loadings of aluminum in the catalysts were measured to be 3.4 per Zr6 node while 4 tin atoms were observed per node, as confirmed using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) (Table S1). When the precursors’ concentration doubled, the tin loading in 0.2Sn@UiO-66 researched to 5.5 per node while aluminum loading per node decreased to 2.1 in 0.2Al@UiO-66 (Table S1). Reduced aluminum loading under more concentrated aluminum precursor was possibly due to the destructive effect of the precursor as Lewis acid on the structure of UiO-66. With aluminum or tin being introduced into UiO-66, the crystallinity of catalysts was well retained compared to the PXRD pattern of parent UiO-66 sample and its simulated pattern ( Fig. 1a). The SEM images revealed similar morphology and particle size to the parent UiO-66 (Fig. S1). In addition, highly uniform distribution of Al and Sn was observed by scanning transmission electron microscopy in conjunction with energy dispersive X-ray (STEM-EDX) elemental mapping (Fig. 1b,c). Type I nitrogen sorption isotherms at – 196 °C of four catalysts were compared with UiO-66 support, where reduced Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) areas were determined to be 1130, 1140, 870 and 800 m2·g–1 for 0.1Al@UiO-66, 0.2Al@UiO-66, 0.1Sn@UiO-66 and 0.2Sn@UiO-66, respectively ( Fig. 2a). In addition, cavities of around 1.1 nm and 1.3 nm were observed from the pore size distribution based on the density functional theory (DFT) method (Fig. 2b) where the decrease of the pore volume was correlated with the loading amount of aluminum and tin. In this study, Al3-based MIL-100(Al) was additionally prepared as an comparison to evaluate the performance of aluminum-loaded catalysts whose experimental PXRD patterns matched well with the simulated pattern (Fig. S2) and octahedral shaped particles were observed with a size of around 1 µm (Fig. S1f). According to the nitrogen adsorption isotherms, a BET area of 1380 m2·g–1 was determined with a pore width of 1.1 nm and 1.95 nm ( Table 1 and Fig. S3). 3.2 Catalytic performance Prior to the performance evaluation, the catalytic conditions of glucose isomerization including temperature and time, were investigated at 70, 90 and 110 °C with the time prolonged to 24 h for an optimum condition ( Fig. 3a). As the temperature increased from 70 °C to 110 °C, glucose conversion on 0.1Sn@UiO-66 gradually increased from 15.4% to 86.37% with improved initial catalytic rate. The highest fructose yield of 28.3% was reached after 12 h′ catalysis at 90 °C and extended time leaded to reduced yield. For the catalysis at 110 °C, the highest fructose yield of 18.1% was reached more quickly after 4 h of reaction time ahead of a significant drop of the fructose yield where the color of the reaction turned into yellow from the initial white color. The yellow color species formed at 110 °C with prolonged catalytic time, can be attributed to the side products such as humin[33,34] and alkyl glucosides [18] which were difficult to be avoided and remain challenging for this reaction. Therefore, optimal catalytic temperature and time of 90 °C and 12 h was determined for the further investigation in this research. The catalytic performance of four aluminum/tin loaded catalysts including 0.1Al@UiO-66, 0.2Al@UiO-66, 0.1Sn@UiO-66, 0.2Sn@UiO-66 was evaluated in propanol at 90 °C for 12 h (Fig. 3b). Compared to parent UiO-66, aluminum/tin loaded Al@UiO-66 and Sn@UiO-66 exhibited remarkably enhanced glucose conversion as well as fructose yield ( Table 2). In addition, 0.1Al@UiO-66 exhibited better catalytic performance than 0.1Sn@UiO-66, which could be attributed to the inherent catalytic activity of Al3+ and Sn4+ [11] as well as the larger porosity of 0.1Al@UiO-66. The Sn@UiO-66 catalysts with tin impregnated within precursor solutions of 0.1 M and 0.2 M exhibited distinct catalytic performance where a much larger glucose conversion of ~68.1% with a fructose yield of ~38.3% was observed on 0.2Sn@UiO-66 compared to 0.1Sn@UiO-66, even though two Sn@UiO-66 catalysts had similar BET area and pore volume (Table 1). The substantially increased catalytic performance of 0.2Sn@UiO-66 can be explained by the larger amount of impregnated tin with more concentrated precursor solution, resulting in more concentrated Lewis acid catalytic sites in the framework (Table S1). As the aluminum precursor concentration increased from 0.1 M to 0.2 M, the obtained 0.1Al@UiO-66 and 0.2Al@UiO-66 catalysts were characterized with similar surface area while the pore volume decreased with the increased precursor concentration. In addition, slightly larger aluminum loading was observed on 0.1Al@UiO-66 than 0.2Al@UiO-66, which endowed 0.1Al@UiO-66 with more acidic sites. As a result, 0.1Al@UiO-66 with larger pore volume and more aluminum loading exhibited a higher glucose conversion of 67.9% with the fructose yield of 37.5% and selectivity of 63.9%. To confirm the robustness of the synthesized aluminum/tin-impregnated UiO-66 as Lewis acid catalysts for glucose isomerization, hot filtration tests were performed where the catalysts were filtered off after 5 h′ reaction and the filtrate continued reacting which was sampled at 8 h, 12 h and 24 h (Fig. 3c). The continuously increased fructose yield after Sn@UiO-66 removal from the reaction could be concluded due to active tin species leached into solution for homogeneous conversion of glucose. On the contrary, no obvious leaching of aluminum was observed on the Al@UiO-66 catalyst where the substrate barely converted after the catalyst was filtered out. 3.3 Characterization of Al@UiO-66 To determine the chemical environment of aluminum in the framework, the 0.1Al@UiO-66 was characterized by 27Al NMR where a group of chemical shifts at 82.8, 22.4, 2.55, –13.7, –50.9 and −129.5 ppm were determined. The aluminum signals in the spectrum reaffirmed the successful impregnation of aluminum in the framework of UiO-66 ( Fig. 4a). Compared with the homogeneous AlCl3 catalyst with six-coordinated aluminum Al(OH2)6 3+ [11], much more complicated aluminum species with diverse chemical environment were observed in 0.1Al@UiO-66 with the chemical shifts ranging from 100 ppm to −150 ppm. The signals at 82.8, 22.4 and 2.55 ppm could be assigned to four-, five-, and six-coordinated aluminum as previously reported [35] . It could be observed that the resonance signals of four-, five-, and six-coordinated aluminum simultaneously shifted to downfield compared to that of alumina and aluminum species in homogenous AlCl3 solution. This downfield shift could be attributed to the potential interactions between active aluminum sites and the dangling carboxylic acid groups in the UiO-66 framework where carbon could have a de-shielding effect on the aluminum species. The remaining three peaks at –13.79, –50.94 and −114.73 ppm have been rarely reported in the literature, but a high correlation with the 27Al NMR spectrum of MIL-69(Al) reported by T. Loiseau et al. was revealed, indicating potential existence of chains of AlO4(OH)2 octahedra [36]. In view of the superior performance of aluminum-loaded Al@UiO-66, MIL-100(Al) constructed from Al3O clusters and trimesate (BTC) linkers was additionally investigated as a comparison for glucose isomerization to indicate the significance of impregnated aluminum sites in UiO-66. Despite of its high porosity and BET area[37], MIL-100(Al) showed negligible activity for glucose isomerization after 12 h′ catalysis (Table 2, entry 2 and 6) where MIL-100(Al) with the same equivalent of aluminum as in 0.1Al@UiO-66 was added into the reaction as the catalyst. According to the analysis of 27Al NMR, six-coordinated aluminum is the main form of aluminum in MIL-100(Al) (Fig. 4a), which has little activity for catalyzing glucose isomerization. However, the chemical environment of aluminum in the prepared catalyst 0.1Al@UiO-66 is much more complicated (Fig. 4) with diverse aluminum species including four-, five-, and six-coordinated aluminum potentially connected to the carboxylate group in the framework, as well as the newly formed chains of AlO4(OH)2 octahedra. Those newly formed aluminum species in 0.1Al@UiO-66 and Zr6 clusters of the UiO-66 framework synergistically performed as the Lewis acid sites, leading to accelerated catalytic performance. To gain further insight into the aluminum species in the catalyst[35,38], the Al 2p X-ray photoelectron spectrum of 0.1Al@UiO-66 was collected and deconvoluted where four peaks at the binding energies of 76.78, 75.01, 74.43 and 72.83 eV could be assigned to AlOx [39], Al(OH)3 [40], Al–O–C[41], and Al[42], respectively (Fig. 4c). The appearance of AlOx and Al(OH)3 could be attributed to the formation of chains of aluminum octahedra. The binding energy corresponding to the Al–O–C structure further suggested the potential interaction between active aluminum sites and carboxylate groups in the framework of UiO-66 with inherent defects. To determine the acidity of the catalyst, NH3-TPD was performed on 0.1Al@UiO-66 and compared with that of UiO-66, where a desorption event between 50 and 300 °C was analyzed. Desorption temperatures of < 200 °C and 200–300 °C correspond to weak and medium acid sites[19]. By deconvolution and integration, the amount of acid sites on UiO-66 and 0.1Al@UiO-66 were determined ( Table 3 and Fig. S4). Notably, under the similar amount of total acid, 0.1Al@UiO-66 possessed more medium acid sites than UiO-66, which can potentially make a difference on its improved catalytic performance. Based on the total acidity characterized by NH3-TPD, the fructose yield was normalized by acid sites in 0.1Al@UiO-66 and UiO-66 and the rate of fructose formation was calculated for the first 5 h′ catalysis (Table 2). The higher fructose formation rate of 0.1Al@UiO-66 than UiO-66 normalized by acid sites further confirmed the improved catalytic activity through the introduction of aluminum Lewis acidic sites. 3.4 Recycling of the 0.1Al@UiO-66 catalyst In order to evaluate the recycling stability of 0.1Al@UiO-66, the used catalyst was recycled for additional three runs of catalysis under identical conditions as the first run. Prior to each cycle, the crystallinity of the catalyst was confirmed by PXRD diffraction ( Fig. 5b). In this recycle experiment, it was observed that the fructose yield decreased in the first reuse to 27.5% which remained much higher than the pristine UiO-66 (Fig. 5a). Fructose yield slightly decreased after following each recycle and at fourth catalysis a fructose yield of 25.8% was observed. 4 Conclusion In summary, a series of Al/Sn@UiO-66 catalysts were facilely synthesized by impregnating UiO-66 into the corresponding aluminum and tin precursor solutions. 2–3 aluminum and 4–5 tin was impregnated per Zr6 cluster in UiO-66, which reduced the specific surface area of UiO-66 without changing its pore size distribution. Both Al@UiO-66s and Sn@UiO-66s displayed much enhanced activity than pristine UiO-66 while Al@UiO-66s behaved better than Sn@UiO-66s with a fructose yield of 37.5% and a selectivity of 67.5% even though less aluminum was loaded on UiO-66 than Tin. In addition, the aluminum catalytic sites are firmly incorporated in the MOF material while Sn@UiO-66s failed the leaching test. Through XPS and 27Al NMR, the chemical state of aluminum in the structure of 0.1Al@UiO-66 was investigated including four-, five-, and six-coordinated aluminum and the chains of aluminum octahedra similar like MIL-69(Al). This work not only provides a new strategy for designing heterogeneous Lewis acidic catalysts but also brings more opportunities for biomass conversion.

Lewis acidic aluminum or tin were firstly impregnated in microporous UiO-66 for remarkably enhanced glucose isomerization. Al@UiO-66 achieved 37.5% fructose yield with a 63.9% selectivity with no obvious leaching of aluminum while Sn@UiO-66 failed the leaching test. The 27Al NMR and XPS spectra of Al@UiO-66 demonstrated the complex environment of aluminum in UiO-66 involving the chains of aluminum octahedra and the Al–O–C structure, which contributed to the enhanced Lewis acidity and promoted performance of the catalyst.",
