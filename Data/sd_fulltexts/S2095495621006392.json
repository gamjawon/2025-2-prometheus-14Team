In 1923, Prof. Shi-Xian Yang joined the faculty and worked with renowned chemists and chemical engineering specialists. In 1932, Prof. Ke-Zhong Zhang set up the Department of Chemical Engineering and the Institute of Applied Chemistry, cooperating closely with industry such as Yongli Alkali Manufac- turing Plant in Tianjin, Huanghaiâ€™s Chemistry and Chemical Research Institute, Lizhong Sulfuric Acid Plant and many others to promote the development of early chemical industry in Tianjin and the nation. Within 1937â€“1945, NKU moved to Kunming and united with Peking University and Tsinghua University to establish the National Southwest Associated University, where Prof. Shi-Xian Yang successively served as the director of chemistry department and the provost of the university. Since the founding of P.R. China, a group of famous scientists including Prof. Zhong-Yue Qiu, Prof. Shi-Xian Yang, Prof. Ke-Zhong Zhang, Prof. Zhen-Heng Gao, Prof. Jian-Han Zhu, Prof. De-Xi Wang, Prof. Pan-Wen Shen, Prof. Bing- Lin He, Prof. Ru-Yu Chen, Prof. Rong-Ti Chen, Prof. Jia-Ding Wang, Prof. Tian-Chi Chen, Prof. Ji-Tao Wang and many scholars laid a solid foundation for the rapid development of Nankai Chemistry, gaining worldwide academic reputation. Nankai Chemistry ranks 9th globally in the 2020 Nature Index of leading institutions in chemistry and 32nd of Best Chemistry Programs from US. News and World Reportâ€™s. In 1995, the College of Chemistry of NKU was formally estab- lished. The college currently consists of two departments, three research institutes and two research centers, and host two national key laboratories, one national engineering research center, one national fundamental scientific research and teaching excellence training center, one national experimental teaching demonstration center, one 2011 collaborative innovation center, and three centers under Chinaâ€™s 111 Introducing Intelligence Project. Covering ten secondary disciplines, Nankai Chemistry features national key first-class discipline and has been selected in the national â€˜double first-classâ€™ construction plan, offering master and PhD degree pro- grams and employing post-doctoral researchers. The college houses 208 faculty members, including eight academicians of Chi- nese Academy of Science and Chinese Academy of Engineering, nineteen national leading talents, twenty-three winners of National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars, and forty-three National Excellent Young Talents. During the past century, Nankai Chemistry has made lasting impact on chemical research and education, following NKUâ€™s motto â€˜Dedication to public interests, acquisition of all-round capability, and aspiration for progress with each passing dayâ€™, as well as the aim of â€˜Knowing China, serving Chinaâ€™. Nankai Chemistry seeks to advance academic breakthroughs and meet the nationâ€™s strategic needs. Achievements include the development of the first batch of organophosphorous pesticides and ion-exchange resins. Lever- aging traditional strength in chemical synthesis, Nankai Chemistry in last decades focuses on the frontiers and applications of new substances directions of elemental organic chemistry, energy and materials chemistry, macromolecular and supramolecular chem- istry. Recent accomplishments are recognized by National Natural Science Awards (one 1st prize and six 2nd prizes), National Tech- nological Invention Award (one 2nd prize), National Scientific and Technological Progress Award (three 2nd prizes), more than 20 provincial 1st prizes, as well as Future Science Prize, Prize for Scientific Exploration and other important awards. Nankai Chemistry has built strong tradition and made contribu- tion in the area of energy chemistry. Led by elder experts such as Prof. Pan-Wen Shen (academician of CAS), groups at Nankai Chem- istry started the research on complex hydrides in 1950s and the investigation on new energy materials in 1970s. In early 1980s, NKU made Chinaâ€™s first nickel-hydrogen batteries and invented â€˜di- rect preparation of ZSM zeoliteâ€™. In 1987, team led by Prof. Yun-Shi Zhang was granted first batch of 863 projects to perform basic research and industrial development on high-energy batteries. In 1992, the Institute of New Energy Materials Chemistry was estab- lished as the first officially-certificated Universityâ€™s institute for new energy research. Later in 1997, the Institute of New Catalytic Materials was set up. These two institutes have focused on basic research and basis applied research on efficient transformation and clean use of energy and resources. After 2000, important R&D platforms including the Key Laboratory of Advanced Energy Materials Chemistry (Ministry of Education) and Research Center on High-efficiency Energy Storage (Ministry of Education) were https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jechem.2021.12.013 2095-4956/ 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V. â‡‘ Corresponding author.

Major directions include molecule-based energy materials, energy catalytic materials, and high-energy power sources and breakthrough are made in examples of spinel electro- catalysts, gas absorption/separation, organic electrodes, organic laminated solar cells, and so on. Recently, Nankai Chemistry is col- laborating with other disciplines (i.e., materials science and engi- neering, physics, electronics, environmental science and engineering, statistics and big data, and artificial intelligence) to promote interdisciplinary research on green and renewable energy, dedicating to supporting the realization of carbon neutrality. On the occasion of 100th anniversary of Nankai Chemistry, we organize this special issue entitled â€˜â€˜Celebrating the Centennial of Chemistry in Nankai Universityâ€� to feature past achievement, recent progress and future efforts in the field of energy chemistry. We invited faculties and alumni of Nankai Chemistry to submit manuscripts, which have been peer reviewed by the international editorial board as well as experts in relevant fields. This special issue collects 12 review articles and 22 research papers, with broad themes covering electrochemical energy conversion and storages, and beyond. Hot topics include metal-ion batteries, functional metal-organic frameworks, perovskites, single-atomic catalysts, (photo)electrocatalysis, CO2 activation and conversion etc., which we believe would attract intensive interest from diverse areas related to energy materials and chemistry. We highly appreciate the contributions of the authors and anonymous referees, and thank the editorial team (Prof. Xinhe Bao, Prof. Gabriele Centi, Dr. Lijuan Zhang, Dr. Yang Gao and other handling editors) of Journal of Energy Chemistry for their kind sup- port and precious work to make the publication of this special issue possible. We also would like to extend our sincere gratitude to those who have concerned about and provided help in the devel- opment of Nankai chemistry. We will endeavor to continue aca- demic exchanges and collaborations with colleagues and readers to jointly advance energy chemistry research. Fang-Yi Cheng, Fu-Xiang Zhang and J.
