RIVES-ARDe'AU* and A MURi?Z I?pto. de Quimica Morgdnica, Facultad de Qu(mica, Unfuersidad de Sevilla, Seville (Spain) Summary The reactivity of CO with a RhC13/-i02 catalyst has been studied using ESR and IR. Different results have been found depending on the manner of contacting the catalyst with the gas. When CO is adsorbed at low pressure and 300 K, heating at 373 K causes CO dissociation, with formation. of carbon which can react with BIZ to produce alcohols. On carrying out the adsorption of CO at 77 K and higher pressure, and subsequently heating the sample at 373 K, a reversible reduction of the support is observed when the specimen is cooled to 77 K. If CO is adsorbed at high pressure and 300 K, an intermediate situation is revealed by ESR, while IR data indicate that subsequent treatment at 373 K gives stoichiometric reduction of rhodium to a Rh' biscarbonyl species. Introduction The existence of a strong electronic interaction between a metallic catalyst and a strongly reduced support has attracted much interest since it was first proposed by Tauster et aL [1 - 3] . While this effect is assumed to involve supportrtometd electron transfer, attention has been also drawn recently to the possibility of the reverse transfer in less reduced catalysts [4 - 5] . To examine such a process, we have studied by ESR and IR spectroscopy the interaction between CO and a RhCI3/Ti02 catalyst precursor under conditions where an intermediate reduction state of the solid can be expected. The results reported here indicate the nearly stoichiometric formation of a Rh' biscarbonyl species at 373 K, and the simultaneous generation of Ti\"E in the support. This is interpreted as the result of a-n electron. transfer from tie mentioned complex to the ssi02 support via hydrogen atoms, and indicates the possibility of catalyzing the water-gas shift reaction with this system. *Present address: Oto. de Qulirnica Ino:ginica, FzcuItac de Fax-macia, Unicersidaa de Salamanca, Salamanca.

The rhodium content of the solid corresponded to 2.590 by weight in the reduced catalyst. Thermal treatments under vacuum or gas atmospheres were made using vacuum glass manifolds with base pressures < i0-3 Nrg 2. Where indicated. CO. was measured volumetrically by means of fractional condensation procedures. I!3, (at 300 K) and ESR (at 7 7 and 300 K) spectra were taken with Perkin-Elmer (model 577) and JEOL JES-3P-X spectrometers respectively. Results Infrared data Upon admission of CO (P = 1 k1Vna 2) at 300 K into the 1R cell containing a catalyst wafer previously evacuated at the wane temperature, three peaks could be observed in the CO stretching range (Fig. 1): one at 2132 cm- 1, cor3ooK CO/ 30,1 w U//t3n) Fig. 1. IR spectra at 300 K (CO stretching rar:ge) of a RhCl3/'ItOa specimen after contact with CO (P = 0.7 kNm Z) at 300 K after increasing time intervals. 233 anal another two (doublet A) at 2093 and 2032 can- I. These two last peaks, having initially small intensities, grew slowly with time while keeping the sample at 300 K, until they exceeded the first one (Fig. Ic, d). The intensities of both peaks remained at all times nearly equal. After heating under the same CO pressure at 373 K, the peak at 2132 cm F vanished, while doublet A increased so strongly that nearly zero transmittance was reached in its wavenumber range. No significant peak was detectable at this moment below 2000 cm F. A parallel volumetric assay was carried out with a known larger amount of sample, and showed that the amount of CO, evolved in this process (after heating under CO at 3'73 K) corresponded closely (within 290) to one C(3 molecule per Rh atom in the catalyst. If Css adsorption at 300 K is performed using a RhC13/Tio2 sample previously evacuated at 423 - 473 K (instead of a fresh one), the subsequent lR spectrum shows mainly two peaks at 2085 anal 2020 cm-', with nearly equal intensities (doublet B), in addition to a broad perk at = 1950 cry t and a small one at 2130 cm- i (Fig. 2a, b). A B-type doublet (2084, 2018 cm-') appears also after CO adsorption at 300 K on a catalyst prereduced under HZ at 473 K; its intensity increases slowly with time (Fig. 3). Peaks in the CH stretching range were also detected after treating the sample at 423 K under a mixture of HZ and CO (Fig. 4). i i 8 ie NzlG73 K (2hl evac. 473 K (2h) CO/ 300 K (15 nin) CO 1300 K (1S h) 1 y a rr Fig- 2.

ES& data After briefly outgassing a sample at 300 K (P = 1 Nm-2 , ZO min), the ESR spectrum showed only traces of a sharp signal at g = 2.002 (assignable to carbonaceous impurities) and at 7 7 K another small, nearly axial one at gl = 1.978 similar to that obtained by reduction of the anatase support used here, which is usually ascribed to Til'I ions [Till' (r)] . After contacting the sample 3t 77 K wish CO (P = 70 kNm-=), no change was observed in the spectrum at this temperature, but when recorded at 300 K a broad signal was detected having nearly axial symmetry. This signal increases and becomes better resolved after short heating under CO (10 min) of the sample at 333 - 373 K, its peak positions being gl = 2.40, g1l = 1.92 (signal A); at the same time, the sharp signal at g = 2.002 nearly disappears. However, trine main change is observed in the 77 K spectrum which shows a strong sharp axial signal (signal Bj with gl = 1.990 and g1l = 1.960 (Fig. 5a). Although of smaller amplitude, the usual Ti... (r) signal at gl = 1.979 is also detected, together with another (signal C) for wh?ch, in spite of its superposition with that of Tl'IF (r), axial symmetry and values of gl = 1.984 and 91, = 1.970 can be distinguished. An interesting observation is that the colour of the sample, which is clear yellow at 300 K, changes quickly io dark blue on cooling to 77 K. This effect is initially ieversihle (the clear yellow colour can be regenerated by vrarming to 300 K, and changed to dark biue on successive cooling cycles), and is not altered if the sample is kept at 77 K for hours. However, if held at 3001r the sample graduaLy loses with time its ability to darken upon cooling, so that after several ho-..rc at 300 K the charge in colour can no longer be detected: the sample remains clear yellow bogy at 300 and 77 K. In the ESR spectrum, the intensity of signal B decreases in parallel with the darkening effect. Signals B and C, and to a smaller degree the peak of Ti\" (r), decrease 23 5 b =s r2 ~ V I an r10 m I b) o _ d ) c.: e) 11~- Fia_ 5.

ESR spectra were also measured after Css adsorption at 300 K under lower pressures (!' = 0. r lam: 2) such. that the ratio of the total number of CO molecules in the sample tube to teat of R,h atoms in the catalyst was nearly 0.5. The spectrum at 300 K showed a small increase in the signal at g = 2.002 (Fig. 6a, b). A more complex spectrum is obtained after heating the sample at 373 K (Fig. 6c). Fn addition to an increment in the g = 2.002 signal, several new peaks are observed in the range g = L3 - 2.4. On the basis of their behaviour under different experimental conditions, these peaks can be interpreted as the sum othree axial signals, having gl = 1.949, g!! 2.322 (signal D), gl = 2.025, g!; = 2.405 (signal E) and gl = 2.025, g!! = 2_fio (signal F). Signals E and F, but not signal D, can also be detected if the sample is evacuated at 373 K prior to CO adsorption. As to the spectrum at 77 K, no signif- 236 icant new signal is detected; in particular, no peak appears in the range g = 1.95 - 1.99, besides the traces of Till' (r) present in the initial sample. ESR spectLa were also recorded after admission of HZ (P = 0.7 kNnz -) to the sample tmated at 373 K with the same pressure of CO. The spectrum of Fig. 6c remained almost unaffected at 300 K. After treatment under this gas atmosphere at 373 K, the signal at g= 2.002 decreases slightly (Fig. 6d), while further heating at 423 K produces a decrease in the entire spectrum, particularly in the g = 2.002 peak (Fig. 6e). If the sample was contacted at 300 K with = 30 kNrz z of CO, slow changes appeared in the ESR spectrum; an increase in the shar=p signal at g = 2.002 and in that of Till. (r), and the appearance of small amounts of signal B could be observed after 4 h under CO at 300 K. Heating (under CO) up to 373 K produced a moderate additional increase in these signals, but the g = 2.002 peak was still smaller than that obtained with low CO pressure (Fig. 6), and signal B was also far smaller than in the experiments where CO was preadsorbed at 77 K (Fig. 5). Assignation of the spectra Infrared data The conditions for the appearance of doublet A and the positions of the peaks point to its assignation to a Rhl(CO)2 species [6] . A similar interpretation can be given to doublet B; the difference in peak position can be ascribed to the presence of different ligands in the rest of the rhodium coordination sphere, bearing in mind that evacuation at 423 - 473 K should eliminate Cl- ions as HC' or C1Z. The peak at 2132 cm 1 is assigned to a terminal Rh`ll (CO) species, and the broad peak centered at 1850 cm-1 to bridging CO groups on clus' ors or small pzrticles of Rh [6] . The bands in the 2850 3000 cm-1 range are similar to those obtained in the system C2Hs0H/Ti02 [ 7] , suggesting the formation of CZ -alcohols in our work. ESR data Considering the method of obtaining signal A, arid its similarity with that detected by Naccache et al. in RhY zeolites [8] , this signal can be assigned to a Rhll carbonyl with a [d(xy)d(xz)d(yz)] 6 -d(zZ)l ground state. The signals with g = 1.95 - 1.99 can be assigned to Till' ions. Signal B has been detected previously, according to the literature, and assigned to interstitial Till' centers [9] , although there is some disagreement about this point [10]. The song thermal dependence of its linewidth, indicating an important spin-lattice relaxation mechanism, has been interpreted as due to a more symmetric coordination environment than that of most TZEEE species found in Ti02, which have gl values in the range 1.96 - 1.98 [9j . We may recall that sign-al B has been observed only in anatase samples that have not been subject to severe thermal or reducing treatments [11] . For this reason, we assign it tentatively to fully hexacoordinated Tiln in relatively 238 Rhi(CO)Z + OH- - Rh (CO) + COZ + H' (2) The H atoms thus formed originate Till' centers through localization of their electrons on Ti\" ions: Tii + T_-I~ :;;!t Till' + H' (3) This process would be displaced to the right at least at 7 7 K. The fact that the dark colour observed at this temperature changes to clear yellow on warming at 300 K can be explained assuming excitation of the unpaired electron to the conduction band of the oxide or displacement of (3) to the left. On the other hand, H atoms may recombine slowly at 300 K (probably on rhodium) to give H2: 2H' r HZ becoming thus gradually less available to take part in (3). This explains the decreases in the darkening effect and in the intensity of ESR signal B with time. Reaction (4) arrives quickly at equilibrium at 300 K on a Rh /Ti02 catalyst [ 5] , but seems to be slower in the case studied here, where rhodium probably remains as a carbonyl complex. The small amounts of RhII ions observed could be formed either as a side reaction in parallel to (1) or by reduction of Rh\"i carbonyl by some of the generated I-I atoms. Figure 6, showing several types of PLO centers, reflects a very different situation. It is no surprise that intermediate reduction states of rhodium are obtained with substoichiometric amounts of CO. The detection of such paramagnetic species may bring in question the assumption above, given that the global reduction (1) taking place at higher pressures proceeds mainly via pairwise electron transfer steps. There are, however, indications that some basic different mechanism is involved at low pressure; these are tile absence of significant 95111 signals and particularly the detection of a substantial amount of carbonaceous residues. Taman, has pointed out recently [13] that, in Fischer-Tropsch catalysis by metallic Ru, important differences appear between reactions under conditions giving high and low CO coverages: when free surface sites are available near active centers bearing coordinated molecules, these can form a second bond with a nearby free site, leading to molecule fragmentation. In our case, for the first situation described, with initially high CO coverage, this effect seldom occurs, but under CO-poor conditions we could have from the onset a process such as: O I C O ___C O C I I I I Rh-Rh - Rh-R.h - Rh--Rh (5) thus explaining the formation of a carbonaceous residue even at 300 K. 239 The mechanism by which the Rh\" centers ere generated is not clear, but may involve Rh-0 species. In any case, the a 3sence of Ti\"' centers can be explained assuming that reaction (2) has not taklin place significantly due to the low amount of CO and incomplete reduction. Under the same conditions used for obtaining the- IR spectra (Fig. 1), ESR shows the absence of Rh\" and the generation of small quantities of carbonaceous species and of Tin' centers (including signal B), the latter only after a few hours. It seems thus that the new Ti',' ions are only formed after an appreciable fraction of Rh' has been produced, in agreement with the proposed reaction (2). While the IR results do show the existence of rhodium clusters after treatments in uacuo or under CO at temperatures of 423 K or higher, no Rho (CO) species nor Rho clusters are revealed by the IR spectra for reduction temperatures T < 373 K. It might thus happen that any Rho centers generated through reaction (2) are reoxidised by adsorbed HO or OH- groups, with further generation of H atoms: Rh (CO) = H20 - OH` + H' + Rh~CO) C? Rh~CO)Z (6) The possibility of such a process, even in samples prereduced in HZ at 473 K, is supported by the results in Fig. 3. We observe that the sum of eans. (2), (4) and (6) gives as a result the water-gas shift reaction: CO + H2J -; COZ T H2 where Rh'(CO)2 would act as a catalyst. As to the low increments in the ESR signals of Ti\"' and carbonaceous species when CO and the RhC13/TiO2 sample are contacted at 300 K and higher CO pressure, we may see in it an indication of the (in some aspects) intermediate character of this situation between those of Figs. 5 and 6. Some CO dissociation takes place, which means that (at least in the very first moments cf adsorption, where coverage would be incomplete), process occurs to some extent. On the other hand, ESR signal B indicates generation of H atoms. When both species are simultaneously produced, they can react with each other, and thus disappear from the ESR spectrum. In fact, it has been shown that the ESR signal at g = 2.002 begins to decrease upon treatment with Hz aet 373 K. These ESR results can be correlated with the IR spectra of Fig. 4, showing formation of CH3 and CH2 groups on reaction under CO + Hz and thus supporting the assumption of CO bond breakage at these temperatures.

On carrying out the adsorption of CO at 77 K and higher pressure, and subsequently heating the sample at 373 K, a reversible reduction of the support is observed when the specimen is cooled to 77 K. If CO is adsorbed at high pressure and 300 K, an intermediate situation is revealed by ESR, while IR data indicate that subsequent treatment at 373 K gives stoichiometric reduction of rhodium to a RhI biscarbonyl species.",
