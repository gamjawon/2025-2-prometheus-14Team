Controlled synthesis of dual-atom catalysts (DACs) for heterogeneous catalytic reactions is vital but still demanding. Herein, we construct a novel dual-atom catalyst containing FeN3-CoN3 sites on N-doped graphene nanosheets (CoFe-NG), which exhibits remarkable catalytic performance with a half-wave potential of 0.952 V for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and shows higher endurance to methanol/carbon monoxide poisoning and better durability than commercial Pt/C. The assembled Zn-air battery with CoFe-NG as the air electrode delivers a peak power density of 230 mW cm–2 and exhibits negligible change in output voltage at 5 mA cm–2 for 250 h. Theoretical calculations reveal that FeN3-CoN3 sites on N-doped graphene exhibit lower ORR barrier than FeN4 and CoN4 sites, and the rate-limiting step on the former is the transformation of *OH intermediate to H2O, different from the transformation of *O to *OH on the FeN4 site and the transformation of O2 to *OOH on the CoN4 site. Graphical Abstract Dual-atom Co-Fe catalysts exhibit excellent ORR performance due to the synergistic effect of Co-Fe dual-sites in the CoFe-NG lowering the energy barrier for the ORR, which can be assembled into zinc-air batteries as air-cathode catalysts, delivering a high peak power density of 230 mW cm–2. Keywords Dual-atom catalyst M-N-C Oxygen reduction reaction Theoretical calculation Zn-air battery 1 Introduction Metal-air batteries have been attracting increasing focus owing to their high efficiency, portability, and flexibility for energy demanding devices [1–5]. However, high energy barrier and torpid kinetics of the ORR result in low output power [6,7]. Despite high ORR performance of Pt-based materials, low resistance to CO poisoning and high cost hinders their industrial application. Therefore, developing cost-efficient, high-performance and durable catalysts based on earth-abundant non-noble metals is imperative [8,9]. To modulate the electronic structure of metal sites and increase the ORR activity, many tactics have been proposed, including heteroatom doping, defect engineering, and isolating metal sites [10,11]. Recently, single-atom M-N-C materials have become promising candidates to substitute noble-metal catalysts [12–19]. Both theoretical simulations and experimental results proved that single-atom Fe/Co-N-C catalysts exhibited excellent ORR activity [20]. For Fe-N-C catalysts, FeN2, FeN4 and FeN5 configurations were proposed as the main active sites. For instance, Guo et al. [21] revealed that low ORR barrier and fast electron transport can be achieved on FeN2 sites. Chen et al. [22] found that the pyridine nitrogen atom in an additional pyridine ring coordinated to the Fe site in FeN4 structure could tune the interaction strength of oxygen on the Fe site and increase the ORR performance. However, a growing amount of research shows that FeN4C x sites might be the efficient centers for the ORR [23]. For Co-N-C catalysts, CoN4 configuration was generally proposed to be active for the ORR. In 2011, Liu et al. [24] annealed cobalt imidazolate framework at 750 °C and adopt acid leaching treatment to obtain a Co-N-C material, which exhibited a half-wave potential (E 1/2) of 0.68 V in 0.1 mol L−1 HClO4. They proposed that the active sites should be CoN4 configuration. Shao et al. [25] discovered that Co-N-C catalysts exhibited better ORR stability than Fe-N-C catalysts due to the lower reaction activity of Co sites for Fenton reactions. However, for monometallic Co-N-C catalysts, the reaction intermediates are adsorbed onto the active sites via side-on or end-on patterns, leading to high ORR barriers and the potential attack of M–N bonds [26]. As a contrast, bimetallic single-atom catalysts containing contiguous metal sites with specific synergic action possess great potential to expedite ORR kinetics [27–30]. Bimetallic sites are expected to improve catalytic activity by facilitating O−O bond cleavage via a bridge-cis adsorption of ORR intermediates. Additionally, beyond the intrinsic activity, bimetallic sites can improve the durability of M-N-C for the ORR and their practical application potential since it could reduce the attack of M–N bonds by O-containing intermediates during the ORR process [31]. Therefore, in recent years, researchers began to explore the synthesis and electrocatalytic properties of bimetallic single-atom catalysts and found that Fe-Co [31], Fe-Mn [26], Fe-Cu [27], Co-Zn [32], and Co-Pt dual-sites[30] can catalyze the ORR efficiently. To further increase the ORR activity, it is necessary to rationally regulate the diatomic structure and introduce more dual-metal sites. Here, we employ a facile one-step method to fabricate a highly efficient ORR electrocatalyst with diatomic Co-Fe sites coordinated to nitrogen atoms in graphene framework (CoFe-NG), which exhibits a positive E 1/2 of 0.952 V vs. RHE, far better than single-atom Fe-NG, single-atom Co-NG, and Pt/C catalysts. The CoFe-NG-based Zn-air battery affords a power density of 230 mW cm−2 and excellent charge-discharge cycling stability, which can successfully power a small bulb. Theoretical calculations reveal that CoFe-NG possesses lower ORR barrier than Fe-NG and Co-NG, and the rate-limiting step on CoFe-NG is the transformation of absorbed *OH to H2O, different from the transformation of *O to *OH on the Fe-NG and the transformation of O2 to *OOH on the Co-NG. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials preparation Typically, 100 mg graphene oxide (GO) was decentralized into 50 mL distilled water through ultrasonic treatment for 1 h, and then 2.4 mg CoCl2·6H2O and 1.4 mg FeCl3·6H2O were added. After the mixture was stirred for 20 min, the water was removed by lyophilization. Lastly, the obtained precursor was annealed at 750 °C under NH3 atmosphere or N2 atmosphere for 2 h, which was nominated as Co0.6Fe0.3-NG-750 (simplified as CoFe-NG) or Co0.6Fe0.3-G-750 (simplified as CoFe-G), respectively. For comparison, Co-NG, Fe-NG, Co0.6Fe n -NG-750 with different Fe contents (n = 0.1 wt%–0.5 wt%), and Co0.6Fe0.3-NG-T annealed at different temperatures (T = 550, 650, 750, and 850 °C) were also synthesized by a similar method to the synthesis of CoFe-NG. 2.2 Characterization High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was performed on a Philips-FEI Tecnai G2S-Twin microscopy. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Shimadzu XRD-6000. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were recorded on a Thermo Fisher K-alpha. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectra of CoFe-NG at Co K-edge and Fe K-edge were performed at the BL14W1 in Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. 2.3 Electrochemical measurements ORR tests were conducted on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E) coupled with a rotating disk electrode (RDE) system, in which a standard calomel electrode (SCE) and a carbon electrode were served as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The potential was standardized into the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to the equation: E RHE = E SCE + 0.241V + 0.0591 × pH. The number of electron transfer (n) is determined by the slope of the line according to the K-L equation [33]. 2.4 DFT calculations Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) was employed for the density functional theory (DFT) calculations [34,35]. The exchange-correlation functional was performed using the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method and Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) potential. The Brillouin zone consists of 2 × 2 × 2 Monkhorst-Pack mesh points. The Nørskov's model was used to explore the ORR mechanism. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis and characterization of CoFe-NG Single-atom Fe-NG, Co-NG, CoFe-NG, and CoFe-G catalysts were synthesized by annealing the mixture of Fe3+/Co2+/graphene oxide under NH3 and N2 atmosphere, respectively (Fig. 1 (a)). The typical nanosheet morphology of the as-prepared CoFe-NG was confirmed by transmission electron microscope (TEM) image (Fig. 1(b)). Moreover, no obvious metal/metal oxide species can be seen on the graphene nanosheets. From XRD patterns (Fig. S1), no peaks due to metal or metal oxide nanoparticles can be observed in the Fe-NG, Co-NG, CoFe-G, and CoFe-NG, indicating excellent distribution of metal species on the graphene-based supports of these samples. The high-angle-annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image reveals that the metal ions are atomically distributed in the CoFe-NG nanosheets (Fig. 1(c)). Moreover, both single atoms and dual single-atoms (highlighted by red circles) exist in the CoFe-NG, and the dual single-atom pairs account for ~50% among all the discernible lightspots. The good distribution of C, N, Fe and Co elements in the CoFe-NG is confirmed by STEM elemental mapping (Figs. 1(d) and 1(e)). The loading amounts of Co and Fe are measured to ca. 1.13 wt% and 0.54 wt% in the CoFe-NG, respectively. The surface compositions of Fe, Co and N species in CoFe-NG were analyzed by XPS (Fig. 2 ). The two peaks at 711.0 and 724.5 eV in Fe 2p XPS spectrum are attributed to Fe2+ 2p 3/2 and Fe2+ 2p 1/2 (Fig. 2(b)). The two peaks at 781.5 and 786.1 eV in Co 2p XPS spectrum are attributed to Co2+ 2p 3/2 and Co2+ 2p 1/2 (Fig. 2(c)). The N 1s XPS spectrum confirms the existence of five different nitrogen species, containing pyridinic nitrogen, metal-nitrogen, pyrrolic nitrogen, graphitic nitrogen and oxidized nitrogen (Fig. 2(d)) [36,37]. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was further employed to recognize the chemical nature and structure of Fe and Co species at the atomic scale (Fig. 3 ). Fig. 3(a) displays the K-edge XANES spectrum of CoFe-NG, FePc, Fe2O3 and Fe foil. The position of the white line for CoFe-NG indicates that the oxidation state of the Fe atom is between 0 and +3 and is close to +2. The EXAFS spectrum of CoFe-NG demonstrates a strong peak near 1.40 Å, due to Fe-N path, and a weak peak near 2.67 Å, corresponding to Fe-Co path (Fig. 3(b)). The fitting results show that the length of Fe–N bond is ca. 2.05±0.02 Å and the length of Fe–Co bond is ca. 2.21±0.03 Å (Fig. 3(c)). Fig. 3(d) demonstrates the Co K-edge XANES spectra of Co foil, CoPc, CoO, Co3O4 and CoFe-NG. The absorption edge of CoFe-NG is situated between the Co foil and Co3O4, indicating the oxidation valence state of the Co atom is higher than metallic Co0 and lower than Co3+ and is close to +2. The EXAFS spectrum of CoFe-NG demonstrates a strong peak near 1.45 Å, ascribe to Co-N path, and a weak peak near 2.67 Å, due to Fe-Co path (Fig. 3(e)). The fitting results show that the length of Co–N bond is ca. 1.90±0.03 Å (Fig. 3(f)). 3.2 Electrocatalytic ORR performance The electrocatalytic ORR activities over the Fe-NG, Co-NG, CoFe-G, CoFe-NG, and commercial 20% Pt/C catalysts were studied using cyclic voltammograms (CVs) (Fig. S2). As observed, the CoFe-NG displays a more positive peak than the Fe-NG, Co-NG, CoFe-G and 20% Pt/C, suggesting higher ORR activity of the CoFe-NG. To further study the ORR prformance, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were collected (Fig. 4 (a)). The E 1/2 for the CoFe-NG is 0.952 V vs. RHE, more positive than Fe-NG (0.872 V), Co-NG (0.857 V), CoFe-G (0.768 V), 20% Pt/C (0.842 V), and most of single-atom catalysts reported previously (Table S1), revealing remarkably enhanced electrocatalytic ORR activity of the CoFe-NG. Moreover, the Tafel slopes derived from the LSV curves using Koutecky-Levich analysis exhibit that the Tafel slope for the CoFe-NG is 46 mV dec–1, much smaller those that for the Fe-NG (82 mV dec–1), Co-NG (56 mV dec–1), CoFe-G (96 mV dec–1), and Pt/C (59 mV dec–1), confirming the excellent activity of the CoFe-NG (Fig. 4(b)). Available active sites involved in the ORR can be evaluated by electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). As exhibited in Figs. S3–S6, the ECSA for CoFe-NG is 432.4 cm2, larger than that for Fe-NG (181.4 cm2), Co-NG (208.1 cm2), and CoFe-NG (181.8 cm2), implying more efficient active sites in the CoFe-NG for the ORR. The effect of annealing temperature and Fe-doping content on the ORR activity of CoFe-NG was studied. As shown in Fig. S7, the optimum annealing temperature is about 750 °C, which might be beneficial to the formation of dual-atom Co-Fe active sites with appropriate nitrogen coordination configuration [31,38]. The Fe-doping content has a significant impact on the ORR performance of CoFe-NG catalyst (Fig. S8). The experimental results reveal that moderate amount of Fe-doping favors high dispersion of metal species, while excessive Fe-doping might lead to the agglomeration of metal species, thus reducing active sites and lowering ORR activity. Koutecky-Levich plots (Fig. 4(c), inset) show nearly collateral fitting lines, indicating the first-order ORR kinetics of CoFe-NG [39]. The calculated electron transfer number of CoFe-NG is 3.93−4.0, suggesting a four-electron ORR process. As shown in Fig. 4(d), from 0.2 to 0.8 V, the electron transfer number for the CoFe-NG is in the range of 3.96–4.0 and the H2O2 yield remained below 2%, further revealing a high efficiency four-electron ORR process on the CoFe-NG. Compared with Fe-NG, Co-NG, and CoFe-G, CoFe-NG not only exhibits a higher current density but also is more selective for oxygen reduction to OH−, rather than peroxide (Fig. 4(d)). The chronoamperometry at 0.8 V vs. RHE of CoFe-NG shows that the ORR current remains 96.6% after 12 h test, far better than that (70%) of Pt/C (Fig. 4(e)). The carbon monoxide poisoning test was performed by introducing carbon monoxide (flow rate: 50 mL s−1) into the electrolyte (Fig. 4(f)). The slight increase in the current for the CoFe-NG might be due to the interference of current signal after initially introducing carbon monoxide gas. Obviously, the CoFe-NG shows much better endurance to CO poisoning than Pt/C. Moreover, the methanol tolerance of CoFe-NG was evaluated by injecting methanol during the chronoamperometric test (Fig. S9), indicating that the CoFe-NG shows better methanol tolerance than Pt/C. To assess the role of metal ions in the ORR, we performed KSCN poisoning experiment. After introducing 10 mmol L−1 KSCN into the KOH solution (Fig. S10), the ORR performances on Fe-NG, Co-NG, CoFe-G and CoFe-NG decrease greatly, implying that SCN– ions should coordinate strongly with Fe and Co sites and make these sites poisoning. The structure of CoFe-NG after ORR test was characterized by XRD (Fig. S11), which demonstrates that no peaks owing to Fe/Co-based nanoparticles can be notably observed. Moreover, we performed TEM image to see whether the single atoms aggregated after the stability test. As illustrated in Fig. S12, no obvious nanoparticles can be seen, indicating that the single atoms did not aggregate during the ORR. In addition, the valence state of Fe and Co in the CoFe-NG after ORR test was analyzed by XPS (Fig. S13). Partial Fe2+ and Co2+ ions were oxidized to high valence state Fe3+ and Co3+ during the ORR process, implying that both Fe and Co sites are involved in the ORR [40,41]. 3.3 Zinc-air battery performance When the CoFe-NG catalyst as an air-cathode catalyst was assembled into a homemade zinc-air battery (ZAB), it can afford an open-circuit voltage of 1.47 V and a high power density of 230 mW cm−2 (Fig. 5 (a)), much higher than those of CoFe-G-based ZAB (1.4 V and 102 mW cm−2), indicating that N-coordination to metal sites is an efficient means to enhance the battery performance. Moreover, the CoFe-NG-based ZAB affords stable galvanostatic discharge performance (Fig. 5(b)), which is very important for highly sensitive electronic devices and can successfully power a small bulb (the inset in Fig. 5(b)). Fig. 5(c) illustrates that CoFe-NG-based ZAB shows outstanding long-range cycling durability in discharge-charge processes, which might primarily be ascribed to the collaborative influence of Co-Fe dual sites in the CoFe-NG lowering the energy barrier for the electrode reaction. 3.4 Theoretical study To confirm the microscopic kinetics of ORR process on the CoFe-NG dual-atom catalyst, the catalytic activity of the Fe-NG, Co-NG and CoFe-NG were elucidated by using DFT calculations. Firstly, the configurations of three intermediates on Fe-NG, Co-NG and CoFe-NG were optimized, as shown in Fig. 6 (a). We found that OH or OOH group can be absorbed onto Fe sites spontaneously and the configuration could energetically favour to the catalytic process, which is consisted with the previous literature [42,43]. Fig. 6(a) illustrates the stable configurations of *OOH, *O, and *OH on the top or side view. In the first step (O2 → *OOH), Co-NG and CoFe-NG are both endothermic and Co-NG shows the highest barrier of 0.49 eV, implying that the adsorption of O2 is harder on CoN4 and CoN3-FeN3 sites compare with FeN4 site (Fig. 6(b)). For the step of *OOH → *O, there are no energy barriers for the reactions on CoFe-NG and Fe-NG except for Co-NG. However, Co-NG and CoFe-NG both exhibit lower energies in the third step of *O → *OH. Instead, Fe-NG shows a high barrier of 0.40 eV. Finally, the last step of *OH to H2O on the three catalytic sites is an endothermic reaction. This result suggests that the three catalytic sites all present the excellent absorbability, especially for CoFe-NG with lower barrier of 0.38 eV. In addition, among the three intermediates, *OOH and *OH are bound to the Fe site, while *O favours to adsorb at the bridge site between Fe and Co, suggesting that the electronic interaction of intermediates with the metal sites and the configuration both play the critical role in the dual-atom ORR catalysis. In the ORR process, the highest potential barrier determines that the rate-limiting step on Fe-NG, Co-NG and CoFe-NG is *O → *OH (0.40 eV), O2 → *OOH (0.49 eV), and *OH → H2O (0.38 eV), respectively (Fig. 6(b)), demonstrating that the CoFe-NG could catalyse the ORR with the lowest energy barrier, which is in line with the experimental results. 4 Conclusions In conclusion, we developed a novel dual-atom catalyst with FeN3-CoN3 sites on N-doped graphene nanosheets through one-pot annealing method. Benefiting from the synergic action of Fe and Co active sites, the CoFe-NG exhibited higher ORR activity than single-atom Fe-NG and Co-NG catalysts and Pt/C in the alkaline environment. The CoFe-NG-based Zn-air battery could afford a high peak power density of 230 mW cm–2 and exhibited negligible change in output voltage at 5 mA cm–2 for 250 h. DFT calculations suggested that FeN3-CoN3 sites exhibited lower energy barrier than FeN4 and CoN4 sites, and the rate-limiting step on the former is the transformation of *OH intermediate to H2O, different from the transformation of *O to *OH on the FeN4 site and the transformation of O2 to *OOH on the CoN4 site. This work will unfold a new window to devise high-performance dual-atom electrocatalysts for the ORR.

        "dc:description": "Controlled synthesis of dual-atom catalysts (DACs) for heterogeneous catalytic reactions is vital but still demanding. Herein, we construct a novel dual-atom catalyst containing FeN3-CoN3 sites on N-doped graphene nanosheets (CoFe-NG), which exhibits remarkable catalytic performance with a half-wave potential of 0.952 V for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and shows higher endurance to methanol/carbon monoxide poisoning and better durability than commercial Pt/C. The assembled Zn-air battery with CoFe-NG as the air electrode delivers a peak power density of 230 mW cm–2 and exhibits negligible change in output voltage at 5 mA cm–2 for 250 h. Theoretical calculations reveal that FeN3-CoN3 sites on N-doped graphene exhibit lower ORR barrier than FeN4 and CoN4 sites, and the rate-limiting step on the former is the transformation of *OH intermediate to H2O, different from the transformation of *O to *OH on the FeN4 site and the transformation of O2 to *OOH on the CoN4 site.",
