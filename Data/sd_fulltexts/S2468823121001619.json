Graphical abstract With the aid of the Density Functional Theory calculations, rate-determining steps were identified for the catalytic hydrogenation cycles of CO2 and precaptured CO2 in forms of carbamic acids. The amino ligand of Ru-MACHO® catalyst was proven initially chemically innocent but participated in concerted hydride and proton transfer reactions to produce methanol. The hydrogenation of carbamic acids were indicated more favourable in methanol production than direct CO2 hydrogenation. Methanol is a liquid hydrogen carrier and potential platform molecule, and significant efforts are currently devoted to hydrogenate CO2 to methanol. In this work, hydrogenations of CO2 and captured CO2 (as dimethylcarbamic acid, DMCA, and methylcarbamic acid, MCA) to methanol over Ru-MACHO (pre)catalysts were studied with a RuII-catalyst model by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. For the hydrogenation of CO2, the concerted reaction was the rate-determining step involving a synchronous hydride transfer and proton transfer from the RuII-catalyst to coordinatively saturated intermediate methanediol. In the hydrogenation cycles of DMCA and MCA, the first hydride transfer reactions were more difficult than the concerted hydride and proton transfer from the RuII-catalyst to the aldehyde group of intermediate formaldehyde. These first hydride transfer reactions were identified as the rate-determining steps. The hydrogenations of DMCA and MCA were found much more favourable in methanol production than the direct CO2 hydrogenation, however, formamides could be main intermediate products due to the easier CO breakage than CN breakage in gem diols, and during the further hydrogenation of formamides, formaldehyde could be the main intermediate due to the easier CN breakage than CO breakage in alkanolamines. In all three hydrogenation cases, the amino (NH) ligand of the RuII-catalyst initially remained chemically innocent, and intermediates were stabilized by NH⋯O hydrogen-bonding interactions (HBIs) facilitating the continuation of catalytic hydrogenation cycles, but the NH ligand took part in multi-bond concerted reactions to produce eventually methanol. Keywords Carbon dioxide hydrogenation Methanol Ruthenium catalyst Amino ligand Concerted reaction DFT calculation Introduction Methanol (MeOH) is not only an important feedstock in the chemical industry for producing chemicals and products including formaldehyde (HCHO), ethylene (CH2CH2) and acetic acid (CH3COOH) [1], but also a hydrogen storage medium (12.5 wt. %) and a convenient liquid fuel for internal combustion engines [2]. Since Olah [3] promoted the concept of a methanol economy in 2005, the potential production of MeOH from atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen gas (H2) has inspired researchers to study the reduction of CO2 by using catalytic hydrogenation [4], electrocatalysis [5] and photocatalysis [6]. Heterogeneous systems such as ternary Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 (CuZnAl) catalysts are widely being used and studied for methanol synthesis from syngas (i.e., a mixture of CO, CO2 and H2) and directly from CO2 [7,8], however, an industrial application is always accompanied by a deactivation behavior of catalyts [9], and high temperatures (e.g., 493–573 K) are needed for a high methanol yield [10]. It should be noted that recent developments in homogenous catalysis have enabled the hydrogenation of CO2 at a low temperature of 100 °C to give high productivity of formate [11], and in 2011, the hydrogenation of CO2 gas to MeOH at a relatively low temperature (135 °C) was achieved by a catalysis sequence, which involves three different molecular catalysts for a successive process of the hydrogenation of CO2 to HCOOH, the esterification of HCOOH to methyl formate (HCO2CH3), and the conversion of HCO2CH3 to MeOH [12]. In additional studies, divalent ruthenium (RuII) pincer complexes-based catalytic processes [13,14] have been rationally designed, and a coupled capture-hydrogenation approach [15,16] allowed CO2 in air to be chemically captured by polyethylenimine and then hydrogenated to MeOH with the Ru-MACHO-BH (1) catalyst at 145 °C. Under the similar condition, MeOH was produced by using the catalyst Ru-MACHO (2), but, formate (OCHO) and N − formyl (NCHO) were the primary products when RuHClPN(Me)PPh(CO) (5) was used [17]. Comparing with the inactive catalyst (5) with the RuII centre coordinating to the N − methyl (NMe) moeity, Ru-MACHO-BH (1) and Ru-MACHO (2), which feature in the amino (NH) functionality, are both Noyori-type bifunctional (pre)catalysts [18–21]. Such (pre)catalysts are attractive in regular (de)hydrogenation and asymmetric transfer (de)hydrogenation [20,22–26], and the role of the amino group has attracted controversy. The amino group has been reported as a proton (H+) donor for catalytic reactions with the resulting amido serving as a H+ acceptor to regenerate the catalysts [25,26]; while computational and experimental studies have also argued that it is chemically innocent (i.e., a chemical inert behavior) [27,28] serving to stabilize the rate-determining transition states and does not break or form NH bonds in catalytic cycles [22,29–33]. This central controversy originates from the reversible H+ transfer from the protic NH group to substrates, which was initially considered proceeding synchronously with the hydride transfer from the metal(M)−H to substrates via concerted transition states in conventional fashion. However, separated transition states have later been shown on the catalytic hydrogenation paths of ketones and esters, and the high energy intermediates connecting the transition states gave rise to new branching reactions [22,29–32]. In principle, the chemically innocent property could be established in the methylation of the amino group leading to an inactive catalyst [29]. Regarding the hydrogenation of CO2, substituting the NH with NMe ligand resulted in no MeOH production but formate and N-formyl (NCHO) formation [17,34,35]. Hence, the NH group might take part in the hydrogenation reactions from intermediates to MeOH but not in the immediate hydrogenation reactions of CO2 to formate. Although there are numerous studies on the hydrogenation of CO2 to HCOOH and the hydrogenation of carbonyl (CO) substrates (ketones, aldehydes, esters, amides…) [20,21,36,37], in order to improve the efficacy of the Noyori-type Ru-MACHO (pre)catalysts in the selective MeOH production from CO2 and captured CO2 species, the innocent or non-innocent role of the NH group should be investigated to locate crossover intermediates and assess branching reactions to avoid other unprojected side-products. As mentioned in the combined capture-hydrogenation approach [17], polyethylenimine was used to capture CO2 chemically, in analogy to amine scrubbing. Liquid amines for CO2 capture have been used industrially in amine scrubbers for a long time [38–40]. The related CO2-amine chemistry has certainly been researched in detail [41,42] and been revisited recently in relation to the approach of carbon capture and recycling [43–45]. As opposed to hindered tertiary amines which can only form bicarbonate anions, unhindered primary and secondary amines can form both bicarbonates and carbamate-ammonium ion pairs [46]. Dimethylamine can be used to capture CO2 gas, and the hydrogenation of dimethylammonium dimethylcarbamate (DMC) ion pair as the captured CO2 species by the Ru-MACHO-BH (1) catalyst was the focal point of an experimental study [14]. However, during the interconversion between carbamate and bicarbonate, carbamic acid has been identified by ab initio molecular orbital calculations [47] and still under debate because of the potential ambiguities of NMR and IR experimental signals [48]. It seems accepted that the carbamate-carbamic acid equilibrium depends on the CO2 partial pressure [49], solvent properties [50], moisture [51,52], stabilization via dimer formation or H-bonding [53], substituent groups [54] and the charge centre proximity of charged substituents on amines [55], etc. It is noteworthy that carbamate-ammonium ion pairs and bicarbonates are stabilized in benzene, CHCl3 and MeOH, but undissociated carbamic acids are preferred in dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide (DMF), and dioxane and under excess CO2 conditions [50,56,57]. Besides, several studies [48,55,58] on amine-modified ionic liquids (ILs) for CO2 capture have shown that carbamate-ammonium ion pairs form when amines are located at the cation while carbamic acids occur when amines are located at the anion. In light of the established stability of carbamic acids under certain practical conditions, dimethylcarbamic acid (DMCA) and methylcarbamic acid (MCA) are in this study presumed to be the captured CO2 species when CO2 reacts with dimethylamine (Me2NH, secondary-amine) and monomethylamine (MeNH2, primary-amine). The molecular reaction energetics of the hydrogenation of DMCA and MCA as well as hydrogenation of CO2 gas were investigated by using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to identify the rate-determining steps, and to show the chemically non-innocent or innocent behaviour of the NH moiety of the targeted Noyori-type Ru-MACHO (pre)catalysts. Methods Computational details A model structure of the RuII-catalyst was used for the targeted Ru-MACHO (pre)catalysts in this study (Figure S1). Structural models were created by using GaussView 6 and all calculations were performed using the Gaussian 16 software (Revision B.01) [59], which are installed on the National Supercomputer Centre in Sweden (NSC), part of Linköping University and the Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing (SNIC). The default values for temperature (298.15 K) and pressure (1 atom) were adopted in all calculations. For geometry optimizations and frequency calculations, the Becke’s three-parameter hybrid B3LYP method [60] was used at the combined basis set of Lanl2DZ for Ru [61–63] and 6−31 G(d) for other light atoms, as the double-zeta pseudo-potential Lanl2DZ basis set with an effective core potential (ECP) is popular for Ru [64]. At the same level of theory, relaxed potential energy surface (PES) scans along the interesting coordinates were conducted and intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations in two directions were employed to confirm the correct transition states (TS). Based on the optimized geometries, single point energies (SPE) were calculated by the B3LYP at the basis set of def2TZVPP with Stuttgart ECP for Ru [65] and 6−311++G(d,p) for other atoms, and the SMD model [66] was employed to consider the solvent effects of tetrahydrofuran (THF, ε = 7.4257) as THF is frequently used in the homogeneously catalytic CO2-to-MeOH hydrogenation systems [67]. In view of the drawback of the B3LYP method in describing van der Waals interactions, dispersion corrected methods including B3LYP-D3BJ, wB97XD-D2, M06-D3 and M062X-D3 with the solvent effect consideration were compared in the SPE calculations for the structures optimized by the B3LYP method. Regarding some key reactions, geometry optimizations were further performed by the B3LYP-D3BJ method with the solvent effect consideration at the 6−31 G(d)/Lanl2DZ level, and SPE calculations were then conducted by the same method at the 6−311++G(d,p)/def2TZVPP level (denoted as the B3LYP-D3BJ (solvent) method). The thermodynamic and kinetic properties of step reactions were discussed according to the reaction Gibbs free energies (ΔG) and activation free energy barriers (ΔG≠) derived from the Gibbs free energies calculated by the B3LYP-D3BJ method with the thermal corrections by the B3LYP method, unless otherwise specified. Results and discussion Hydrogenation of CO2 The targeted Ru-MACHO (pre)catalysts are divalent RuIIbased complexes and typical Noyori-type catalysts with a potential ability to form NH⋯O hydrogen-bonding interactions (HBIs) with CO2 via the amino (NH) group [30]. A model structure of the RuII-catalyst with two hydride ligands was used in our calculations, and the predicted catalytic hydrogenation cycle of CO2 is presented in Scheme 1 . Based on the calculations by the B3LYP-D3BJ method, the first nucleophilic attack of the two hydride ligands of the RuII-catalyst to the C centre of CO2 resulted in two different formate intermediates; the formate intermediate with a lower Gibbs free energy was more stable when the NH⋯O HBI formed (Fig. 1 a) than without the HBI formation, where CO2 approached the RuII-catalyst from the opposite face (Fig. 1b). Accordingly, the nucleophilic attack reaction was dominated by the NH⋯O HBI and corresponded to the hydride transfer from the Ru−H to CO2 via the transition state TS1,2 (Fig. 1c). This first hydride-transfer reaction (1 → 2 in Scheme 1) was exergonic (ΔG = -4.1 kcal mol−1) with the activation free energy barrier being 2.2 kcal mol−1, which is close to the calculated activation free energy barriers of the hydride attack reaction between CO2 and Ru(H)2(PMe3)3(H2O) (3.3 and 3.6 kcal mol−1 respectively by the MP4(SDQ) and B3LYP method), and much lower than that of the insertion of CO2 into the Ru−H bond (16.1 kcal mol−1 by the MP4(SDQ) method) [36]. During the first hydride transfer reaction (1 → 2 in Scheme 1), the distance between hydride and carbon (C) centre decreased from 2.618 Å in 1 to 1.235 Å in 2, but was still significantly longer than the CH bond in a formate anion (1.152 Å) calculated by the same method. This long CH bond implied that the empty dσ-orbital of Ru expanded toward the negatively charged H atom of formate forming an ion-pair intermediate 2, which was stabilized by Coulombic interactions, non-classical CH⋯Ru hydrogen bonding [68]and classical NH⋯O hydrogen bonding. The subsequent proton transfer along the NH⋯O coordinate (the branch reaction of 2 shown by the red dash line in Scheme 1 and Fig. 2 a), producing formic acid (HCOOH) and a H2-deficient catalyst, was considerably endergonic (ΔG =14.5 kcal mol−1). No transition state was indicated for this step by the relaxed PES scan (Figure S2a of SI). The alternative formate rotation in 2 resulted in the monodentate formate complex RuII(η1-OCHO) 3 via the RuO formation, no transition states were found according to the relaxed PES scans in both the clockwise and anti-clockwise directions (Figure S2b of SI), and this reaction was predicted to be exergonic (ΔG = -9.5 kcal mol−1, 2 → 3 shown by the black line in Scheme 1 and Fig. 2a). The RuO formation was accordingly more favourable than the proton transfer, which indicated the chemically innocent behaviour of the NH group, and formic acid was not formed at the crossover 2. The formate complex RuII(η1-OCHO) (3) is widely accepted as the key intermediate during the hydrogenation of CO2 [69–72], and the following δ-bond metathesis of the Ru-O proceeded through the heterolytic cleavage of a H2 molecule (4 → 5 in Fig. 2b). The HH bond cleavage progressed via the 8-membered transition state TS4,5 (Fig. 1d), and was a slightly endergonic reaction (ΔG =1.6 kcal mol−1) with an activation free energy barrier of 4.6 kcal mol−1. The resulting formic acid in complex 5was still stabilized by the NH⋯O HBI, and thus the hydride transfer again occurred and the hydrogenation cycle was continued. The second hydride transfer reaction (5 → 6 in Scheme 1 and Fig. 2a) was an endergonic reaction (ΔG =8.2 kcal mol−1) via the transition state TS5,6 (Fig. 1e and Figure S2c of SI) with the activation free energy barrier being 8.2 kcal mol−1. This hydride-transfer reaction was less favourable than the first hydride transfer reaction (1 → 2) both thermodynamically and kinetically as compared in Fig. 2a. The new formed CH bond in 6 (1.281 Å) was substantially longer than in 2 meaning that 6 was also an ion-pair intermediate and stabilized by Coulombic interactions and hydrogen bonding. The proton transfer from the NH group in 6 via the transition state “TSe ” (Fig. 1f and Figure S2d of SI) produced methanediol (CH2(OH)2) and the H2-deficient catalyst, and was exergonic (ΔG = -2.6 kcal mol-1) with an activation free energy barrier of -0.7 kcal mol-1 (the branch reaction of 6 shown by the red line in Scheme 1 and Fig. 2a). This negative activation barrier indeed indicated that 6 was an unstable ion-pair intermediate. The alternative RuO formation reaction, leading to the methanediol ion-pair complex RuII(η1-OCH2OH) (6 → 7 shown by the black line in Scheme 1 and Fig. 2a), was more favourable (ΔG = -8.1 kcal mol−1) than the branch proton transfer reaction; therefore, the NH group remained chemically innocent at the crossover 6. The RuO bond of 7 (2.245 Å) was longer and weaker than in formate complex 3, and the second metathesis reaction of Ru-O by H2 (8 → 9 in Scheme 1 and Fig. 2b) was exergonic (ΔG = -1.1 kcal mol−1) with the activation free energy being 10.8 kcal mol−1. Different from the HH cleavage in4 → 5 via the 8-membered TS4,5 , the HH cleavage in8 → 9 via the 6-membered TS8,9 (Fig. 1g) was similar to a protic solvent assisted HH cleavage proceeding via the “TSg” [31]. Such assisted cleavage has been widely reported to progress synchronously with the proton transfer from protic solvents to the amido group [73–75]. The HH cleavage viaTS8,9 was exergonic (Fig. 2b) and independent on the proton transfer from methanediol to the amido group via “TSe”, i.e., the inverse of the proton-transfer reaction in 6, which agreed on the stepwise HH cleavage and proton transfer. In complex 9, the methanediol moiety was stabilized by a NH⋯O HBI because of the intact NH group, and the third hydride transfer reaction continued the hydrogenation cycle. The third hydride transfer reaction (9 → 10 in Scheme 1) progressed via a multi-bond concerted transition state TS9,10 (Fig. 1h), and was exergonic (ΔG = -4.5 kcal mol−1) with a very high activation free energy barrier of 62.0 kcal mol−1 (Fig. 2c). This concerted reaction involving the synchronous transfer of hydride and proton to methanediol and produced MeOH and H2O through the COH bond breakage of methanediol. It was much more difficult than the first two hydride transfer reactions (1 → 2 and 5 → 6), where the sole hydride transferred to the coordinatively unsaturated carbonyl (CO) group. The understanding of the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group via a concerted transition state “TSa” has recently been replaced by a consecutive hydride and proton transfer processes respectively via “TSd” and “TSe” [31]. In this study, TS1,2 and TS5,6 for the first and second hydride transfer possessed similar structures to the “TSd”, and these hydride transfer processes were independent on the subsequent proton transfer; the ion-pair intermediates 2 and 6 were easily located by the B3LYP method. However, the concerted TS9,10 was located by the same method and no intermediate was observed for the third sole hydride transfer. Accordingly to some previous studies [76–79], high energy ion-pair intermediates could be disregarded in gas phase calculations, and hence concerted transition states were wrongly reported in the non-classical hydrogenation mechanism. In this regard, the D3LYP-D3BJ method with the implicit solvent model was further involved for transition-state optimizations in solvent phase, and the newly located TS9,10 gave similar displacement vectors and only a minor difference in the imaginary frequency (856.27i cm−1 in solvent phase vs. 872.36i in gas phase). Besides, the IRC scan of TS9,10 in gas phase (Figure S2e of SI) indicated that even during the concerted process, the breakage of RuH, NH and CH bonds occurred asynchronously. Specifically, the COH bond broke first, the hydride then transferred from the Ru to the C centre producing MeOH, and finally the proton transferred from the NH of the RuII-catalyst to the OH group of methanediol forming H2O. Concerted hydride transfer reactions with the delayed proton transfer have also been reported for the hydrogenation of formaldehyde based on optimizations with explicit water and methanol solvent models [80,81]. Such a concerted and asynchronous property has also been confirmed theoretically and experimentally for other hydride-and-proton transfer reactions [82,83]. The hydride-and-proton transfer has been shown to occur either smoothly or sharply with stepwise reactions, and these differences have been related to the effects of changes in the life times of short-lived intermediates and to solvent relaxation effects and nucleophilic properties of substrates [84,85]. The hydride-and-proton transfer reaction via the TS9,10 in the CO2 hydrogenation cycle was therefore computationally confirmed both in gas and solvent phase, and such a multi-bond concerted process indicated that the NH group of the RuII-catalyst did not remain chemically innocent anymore and led to the methanol production. Considering the regeneration of the RuII-catalyst with H2, the transition state “TSb”was localized for the HH cleavage reaction of H2-catalyst → catalyst (dash blue line in Scheme 1), and the multi-bond concerted “TSc” was found for the HH cleavage of 11 → 12 in the presence of a H2O molecule (solid blue line in Scheme 1). The activation free energy of 11 → 12 was 5.7 kcal mol−1 lower than that of H2-catalyst → catatlyst (Fig. 2d), indicating the assisting role of H2O in the HH cleavage reaction. Analogously, the HH cleavage reaction in the presence of methanediol (8 → 9) and in the presence of formic acid (4 → 5), respectively, lowered the activation free energy barrier by 0.7 kcal mol−1 and 7.0 kcal mol−1 in comparison with that of H2-catalyst → catalyst, indicating the assisting role of methanediol and formic acid. In the solvent-assisted HH cleavage mechanisms reported in other studies, two separate transition states “TSf” and “TSg” were found and ascribed to the effects of solvents [30–33]. In the regard of solvent effects, the B3LYP-D3BJ (solvent) method was used to locate separate transition states for the reaction 11 → 12 in solvent phase, but the concerted “TSc” was found with the similar displacement vectors and only a minor differences in the imaginary frequency as compared with the “TSc” optimized in gas phase (1126.22i cm−1 in solvent phase vs. 1129.10i in gas phase). The IRC calculation of the “TSc” in gas phase further exhibited that during 11 → 12, the HH bond cleavage progressed along with the formation of the RuH bond, the proton donation from the Ru−(η2-H2), and the proton donation from H2O to the amido group (Figure S2f of SI). The regeneration of the RuII-catalyst by H2 with H2O present occurred thus as a concerted reaction. The relative free energy profiles of the complete hydrogenation cycle of CO2 calculated by different methods were compared in Fig. 3 , and the consistent prediction was that the whole hydrogenation process was on an uphill pathway and the concerted hydride and proton transfer reaction was the rate-determining step. However, among all these methods, the B3LYP-D3BJ (solvent) method (with the structure optimization in solvent phase) predicted the highest activation free energy barrier for the reaction 4 → 5 but the lowest activation free energy barrier for the rate-determining step (9 → 10). It was noticed that the B3LYP-D3BJ method (with the structure optimization in gas phase) not only gave modest activation free energy barriers for all reaction steps, but also predicted very close reaction free energies to the B3LYP-D3BJ (solvent) method (Table S1 and S2 of SI), and it was therefore sufficient to identify the rate-determining steps and enhance the understanding why the production of methanol from the hydrogenation of pure CO2 gas is challenging. Hydrogenation of DMCA and MCA Distinguished from carbamate and bicarbonate which have been widely reported as captured CO2 species, carbamic acids (DMCA and MCA), appearing in certain solvents and under conditions of excess CO2 [50,56,57], contain a carbonyl and a hydroxyl group that are inequivalent in forming hydrogen bonding with the NH ligand of RuII-catalyst. Specifically, two transition states were located for the hydride transfer reaction of DMCA when the carbonyl O and the hydroxyl O atom were respectively involved in the NH⋯O HBIs. The reaction associated with the carbonyl O (Figure S3a of SI, ΔG =18.2 kcal mol−1 and ΔG≠ = 20.7 kcal mol−1) was more favourable than that associated with the hydroxyl O (ΔG =25.7 kcal mol−1 and ΔG≠ = 25.0 kcal mol−1), which indicated that the hydrogen bonding formed between the carbonyl O and the NH group directed the hydrogenation reactions. The catalytic hydrogenation cycles of DMCA and MCA are proposed and presented in Schemes 2 and 3 . In comparison with the first and second hydride transfer reactions of CO2 (1 → 2 and 5 → 6 in Fig. 2a), the first hydride transfer reactions of DMCA and MCA (A1 → A2 via TSi in Scheme 2 and Fig. 4 ) were much more difficult with assoicated higher reaction free energies and higher activation free energy barriers. At the crossover A2, the proton transfer via transition state TSii (Figure S3b of SI) was less favourable than the Ru-O formation (Fig. 4), and hence the NH group of the RuII-catalyst was chemically innocent here. Regarding the RuO bond metathesis of A3 by H2, the breakage of the HH bond (A4 → A5) was much more favourable (DMCA: ΔG = -13.3 kcal mol−1; MCA: ΔG = -12.3 kcal mol−1) than in the hydrogenation cycle of CO2 (ΔG = 9.7 kcal mol−1 for 4 → 5* and -1.1 kcal mol−1 for 8 → 9* in Fig. 2b). Although a NH⋯O HBI was retained in A5, the geminal diols ((CH3)2N− CH(OH)2 and CH3NH−CH(OH)2) with two hydroxyl groups on the C centre were unstable, and would either release (di)methylamine by breaking the CN bond (A5 → B1 via the TSiii in Scheme 2 and Figure S3c of SI), or release H2O by breaking the CO bond (A5 → B2 via the TSiv in Scheme 2 and Figure S3d of SI). As compared in Fig. 4a and 4b, the former A5 → B1 was kinetically less favourable (DMCA: ΔG = -11.4 kcal mol−1 and ΔG≠ = 25.3 kcal mol−1; MCA: ΔG = -11.1 kcal mol−1 and ΔG≠ = 27.1 kcal mol−1) than the latter A5 → B2 (DMCA: ΔG = -23.5 kcal mol−1 and ΔG≠ = 18.1 kcal mol−1; MCA: ΔG = -21.3 kcal mol−1 and ΔG≠ = 20.5 kcal mol−1), therefore, the CO bond was easier to break than the CN bond at the crossover A5 (Scheme 2). By releasing the H2O, formamides intermediates were produced from the complex B2, i.e., DMF in DMCA case and monomethylformamide (MMF) in MCA case, and were stabilized via a NH⋯O HBI in B3, allowing the continuation of catalytic hydrogenation cycles. Further hydrogenation of DMF and MMF intermediates The hydrogenation of DMF and MMF started from the complex B3, as presented in Scheme 3. The hydride transfer reactions (B3 → B4 via TSv in Figure S3e of SI) were as difficult as that of DMCA and MCA (DMF: ΔG =18.2 kcal mol−1 and ΔG≠ = 18.7 kcal mol−1; MMF: ΔG = 18.4 kcal mol−1 and ΔG≠ = 14.6 kcal mol−1). The proton transfer in B4 via TSvi (branch reactions shown by dash lines in Scheme 3 and Fig. 5 ), producing alkanolamines, i.e., dimethylaminomethanol in DMF case and methylaminomethanol in MMF case, were exergonic with negative activation free barriers (DMF: ΔG = -2.3 kcal mol−1 and ΔG≠ = -4.6 kcal mol−1; MMF: ΔG = -5.1 kcal mol−1 and ΔG≠ = -5.4 kcal mol−1), indicating that B4 were indeed high energy ion-pair intermediates. The alternative Ru-O formation reactions in B4 leading to B5 were more favourable (DMF: ΔG = -5.1 kcal mol−1; MMF: ΔG = -6.6 kcal mol−1) than the proton transfer reactions, which indicated that at the crossover B4 the production of alkanolamines was not preferable and that the NH group of the RuII-catalyst remained chemically innocent. During the RuO bond metathesis of B5 by H2, alkanolamines were easily produced through the HH bond breakage (B6 → B7 in Scheme 3 and Fig. 5) and stabilized by the RuII-catalyst through a NH⋯O HBI. Just like geminal diols on the hydrogenation pathways of DMCA and MCA, alkanolamines on the hydrogenation pathways of DMF and MMF could break either the CN bond or the CO bond. The CN bond breakage of alkanolamines occurred through anintermolecular proton transfer (B7 → B8 via TSvii in Scheme 3, Fig. 5 and Figure S3f of SI) and produced formaldehyde (CH2O) and (di)methylamine (dimethylaminomethanol: ΔG =1.9 kcal mol−1 and ΔG≠ = 24.4 kcal mol−1, methylaminomethanol: ΔG = 7.5 kcal mol−1 and ΔG≠ = 25.9 kcal mol−1). The CO bond breakage could only occur during the hydride transfer from the RuII-catalyst to the C centre of the alkanolamines (B7 → 11 in Scheme 3), and the energy barrier was very high (ca. 80 kcal mol−1, Figure S4 of SI) in the dimethylaminomethanol case, and this barrier was even about 30 kcal mol−1 higher than that of the rate-determining step of CO2 hydrogenation (ca. 50 kcal mol−1, Figure S2e of SI). Consequently, the CN bond of alkanolamines was easier to break than the CO bond at the crossover B7, and the hydrogenation of DMF and MMF thus led to the production of formaldehyde (CH2O) and the release of pristine (di)methylamine. Besides, the CN breakage in dimethylaminomethanol was slightly easier than in methylaminomethanol, which implied that dimethylamine (or secondary amines) could be preferred over methylamine (or primary amines) in the capture-and-hydrogeneration cycle of CO2. The subsequent hydrogenation of formaldehyde proceeded through a concerted hydride and proton transfer (B8 → B9 via TSviii in Figure S5 of SI). The B8 → B9 was predicted to be exergonic (ΔG = -1.9 kcal mol−1, ΔG≠ = -0.6 kcal mol−1) and led to MeOH and the H2-deficient catalyst, where the NH group of the RuII-catalyst was not innocent anymore. The concerted nature and the chemically non-innocent role of the NH group have also confirmed in the dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde in other studies, both with and without solvent-effects considerations [27,86,87]. Here, the B3LYP-D3BJ (solvent) method (with the structure optimization in solvent phase) and the B3LYP-D3BJ method (with the structure optimization in gas phase) gave consistent predictions on the hydrogenation of both DMCA and the subsequent DMF (Figure S6 of SI). Specifically, i) the NH group of the RuII-catalyst was chemically innocent at the crossover A2 and B4, ii) the easier breakage of the CO bond than the CN bond of the gem diols in complex A5 led to DMF production, iii) the easier breakage of CN bond than the CO bond of alkanolamines in complex B7 led to the pristine dimethylamine and formaldehyde, iv) consistent transition states were located with only minor differences in the imaginary frequency, and v) consistent thermodynamic and kinetic properties were predicted for all reaction steps. Accordingly, not much additional insight was achieved when implicit solvent model was employed during the structure optimization, and the B3LYP-D3BJ method (with the structure optimization in gas phase) was judged to be acceptable, which predicted that all of the hydride transfer steps were quite difficult, and that the first hydride transfer reactions of DMCA and MCA were the rate-determining steps on the whole hydrogenation pathways from the captured CO2 to methanol. More importantly, the NH group was predicted chemically innocent before the production of formaldehyde but not innocent during the hydrogenation of formaldehyde to methanol, which could be inspiring to the structural design of future catalysts. Conclusion The hydrogenation of CO2 gas and two CO2-amine reaction products over the Noyori-type Ru-MACHO (pre)catalysts were studied with a RuII-based model by DFT calculations. Dimethylcarbamic acid (DMCA) and methylcarbamic acid (MCA), as reaction products from CO2 by a secondary amine (Me2NH) and a primary amine (MeNH2), were concerned in this study as carbamic acids have been shown to be stabilized in some dipolar and aprotic solvents and under conditions of excess CO2. Based on the predicted catalytic cycle for the hydrogenation of CO2 gas, the hydride-transfer reactions were less favourable than RuO coordinate formation reaction at crossover points, confirming the chemically innocent behaviour of the NH group of the RuII-catalyst. Due to the intact NH group, intermediates were stabilized by NH⋯O hydrogen-bonding interactions (HBIs), allowing the continuation of the catalytic hydrogenation cycle. The rate-determining step of the whole CO2 hydrogenation was a multi-bond concerted reaction where the NH group of the RuII-catalyst was not innocent and the hydride and proton transferred synchronously from the RuII-catalyst to methanediol intermediate. In the predicted hydrogenation cycles of DMCA and MCA, the CO bond was easier to break than the CN bond in the geminal diols, and formamides (DMF and MMF) were important intermediates. During the further hydrogenation of formamides, the CN bond breakage was easier than the CO bond breakage in alkanolamines, and led to the production of formaldehyde and the release of pristine (di)methylamine. Importantly, the NH ligand of the RuII-catalyst was chemically innocent before formaldehyde production but participated in the hydrogenation of formaldehyde to MeOH. The rate-determining steps in the hydrogenation cycles of DMCA and MCA to MeOH were the first hydride transfer reactions, which were kinetically much more favourable than the rate-determining step of the direct CO2 hydrogenation to MeOH (Table S4). In summary, the hydrogenation of amine-captured CO2 in the form of carbamic acids could be more advantageous in MeOH production than the direct CO2 hydrogenation, but the NH ligand of the RuII-catalyst would not always remain chemically innocent if MeOH was a targeted product.

        "dc:description": "Methanol is a liquid hydrogen carrier and potential platform molecule, and significant efforts are currently devoted to hydrogenate CO2 to methanol. In this work, hydrogenations of CO2 and captured CO2 (as dimethylcarbamic acid, DMCA, and methylcarbamic acid, MCA) to methanol over Ru-MACHO (pre)catalysts were studied with a RuII-catalyst model by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. For the hydrogenation of CO2, the concerted reaction was the rate-determining step involving a synchronous hydride transfer and proton transfer from the RuII-catalyst to coordinatively saturated intermediate methanediol. In the hydrogenation cycles of DMCA and MCA, the first hydride transfer reactions were more difficult than the concerted hydride and proton transfer from the RuII-catalyst to the aldehyde group of intermediate formaldehyde. These first hydride transfer reactions were identified as the rate-determining steps. The hydrogenations of DMCA and MCA were found much more favourable in methanol production than the direct CO2 hydrogenation, however, formamides could be main intermediate products due to the easier CO breakage than CN breakage in gem diols, and during the further hydrogenation of formamides, formaldehyde could be the main intermediate due to the easier CN breakage than CO breakage in alkanolamines. In all three hydrogenation cases, the amino (NH) ligand of the RuII-catalyst initially remained chemically innocent, and intermediates were stabilized by NH⋯O hydrogen-bonding interactions (HBIs) facilitating the continuation of catalytic hydrogenation cycles, but the NH ligand took part in multi-bond concerted reactions to produce eventually methanol.",
