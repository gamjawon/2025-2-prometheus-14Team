Graphical abstract This work synthesized a porous carbon material with a wide range of nitrogen content. The relation between the nitrogen content and capacity/cyclability of Lithium-oxygen battery is revealed. This work reveals a balance between the improved oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction activity of nitrogen doped carbon and the concomitant activity in the decomposition of the electrolyte of the Lithium-oxygen battery. The capacity and cyclability of Lithium-oxygen battery increase with the nitrogen content to a vertex, then decrease with higher nitrogen content. The largest capacity of 7250 mA g−1 and the best long-term stability of 71 cycles over 420 h are found in a catalyst with proper content of nitrogen. It is also found nitrogen doping can improve the work function of the carbon material, making it more resistant to decomposition in the working conditions of Lithium-oxygen battery. Keywords Lithium-oxygen battery Cathode material Defect Nitrogen content 1 Introduction The overuse of fossil fuels has caused energy crisis and environmental pollution. To settle these problems, the scientific community has proposed many promising solutions among which the Lithium-oxygen batteries or other metal-oxygen batteries have attracted great attentions [1]. Compared with fossil fuel, these devices benefit from low working temperature, high power density, quick start-up and significant reduction of the emission of CO2. Lithium-oxygen batteries with high theoretical energy densities have attracted the greatest interest [2–4]. However, the Lithium-oxygen batteries have some crucial problems to be settled for commercialization such as cycling stability, coulombic efficiency and rate performance [5–7]. The poor cycle performance and large overpotential can be caused by several factors. For instance, the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction (ORR/OER) reactions especially the OER process are the major reasons for the high overpotential [8–10]. The incomplete decomposition of the discharge products or the side products caused by overlarge overpotential negatively influence the cycle performance. Moreover, the side reaction between the electrolyte and cathode material could induce poor ion-conductive film and passivate the active material [11–13]. To solve these problems, many efforts have been devoted in designing the highly active, relatively stable cathode materials [14–16]. Shu et al. reported a three-dimensional (3D) MoS2 network, which showed low overpotentials and excellent cycling stability of 132 cycles [17]. Zhang reported 3D LaFeO3 with low overpotential, high specific capacity, good rate capability and cycle stability up to 124 cycles.[18] The efforts of the solution of side reaction include many works on protecting the cathode with ZnO film [19], thin solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film [20] and protective In2O3 layer [21]. Zhou prepared core–shell-structured CNT@RuO2 composite which can avoid the direct contact between CNT and the discharge product (Li2O2) and reduce the formation of Li2CO3 [22]. All these methods proved better cycle performance in Lithium-oxygen battery. Among the various cathode materials, the carbon-based material with abundant defect is appealing due to its efficient and economics [23]. For example, Sun et al. [24] reported nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets with abundant defects delivered a discharge capacity of 11,660 mA g−1, which is 40% higher than the pristine graphene nanosheets. The improved capacity can be explained by the lowered transport barriers of electron and mass by efficient diffusion paths offered by the high density defects of the carbon materials [25]. Some kinds of defects on the carbon surfaces are found to ensure excellent electrical conductivity, lower charge voltage and stabilize cyclability, while they are negative in promoting the formation of side product Li2CO3 [26]. It is reported the oxygenated functional groups and associated defects promote carbonate production [27]. The nitrogen doped carbon has been proved to show improved electrochemical catalytic activity in Lithium-oxygen battery [24,28]. However, the mechanism on such improvements still remains vague. The explanation can go to the improved performance in ORR/OER by the nitrogen doped carbon [29–31]. The nitrogen functional groups in nitrogen doped carbon are graphitic N, pyridinic N and pyrrolic N, among which the graphitic N site is believed to be the most effective catalytic site for ORR due to the electron accepting effect [32]. The relation between the content of doped nitrogen and performance is studied, in one work carbon nanotubes with different nitrogen amounts are studied and it is found increased nitrogen content from 1.07% to can lead to lower overpotential and improve the cycling stability [33]. The same effect is also found in nitrogen-doped Ketjen carbon black [34]. However, previous research did not get noticeable improved cycle performance. The relation between the cycle performance and the wide-range-changed nitrogen content is also not clear. In this work, we prepared nitrogen doped carbon with a series of nitrogen contents by a “salt template” method [35–36]. Then we studied the relationship between the nitrogen content and the specific capacity and cycle stability. A saturation effect is found in the nitrogen content in terms of capacity and stability of the Lithium-oxygen battery. The optimized nitrogen content is found to be 6.55% in atomic ratio for the best specific capacity and cycle stability. Moreover, excess content of nitrogen is found to result in severe side reaction due to the promotion of highly active sites in the decomposition of the electrolyte during the charging process, which finally lead to poor performance of the battery. We did not find the relation between the specific nitrogen functional group and the battery performance. The findings of this work will help in designing cost effective and high performing cathode material for the Lithium-oxygen battery. 2 Experimental All chemicals were of analytical grade and from Aladdin®. All water was deionized water purified by the HITECH laboratory water purification system and the impedance was 18.3 MΩ. 2.1 Synthesis The synthesis of the electrocatalyst was based on the procedure in the literature.[37] Briefly, 0.5 g Tannic acid (AR) and 0.5 g urea (99.5%) were dissolved into 10 ml ultrapure water and stirred at room temperature, then 10 g ZnCl2 (AR) was added in the solution and stirred at room temperature for 30 min to form homogeneous mixture. The mixture prepared was dried under vacuum at 105 °C for 30 h. The mixture was pyrolyzed at 600°C for 1 h under nitrogen protection at a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1. After carbonized, the solid were treated by HCl (3 M) to remove the impurity and washed for several times with deionized water. The final products were dried at 80 °C for 12 h. The content of nitrogen is controlled by the ratio of urea, benzoquinone and Tannic acid. For the preparation of 0% nitrogen content carbon, 1 g benzoquinone was used without nitrogen source instead of Tannic acid and urea, other steps are the same as the above procedures. The samples with nitrogen content of 1.31%, 4.35%, 6.55% and 11.82% are labeled as NEC1, NEC4, NEC6 and NEC12, respectively. 2.2 Physical characterizations The morphologies of the catalysts were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100HR, JEOL Ltd., Japan) operating at 200 kV. The structures of the samples were characterized on an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D/Max-IIIA, Rigaku Co., Japan, CuK1, λ = 1.54056 Å radiation). The degree of surface defect and graphitization were determined by Laser Micro-Raman Spectrometer (Renishaw inVia, Renishaw plc, UK). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were acquired using an ESCA Lab 250 (Thermo VG) with 200 W Al Kα radiation in twin anode and the distance between X-ray gun and sample is about 1 cm. The analysis chamber pressure is about 2 × 10−7 Pa and the pass energy is 20 eV for high resolution scans. XPS peak deconvolution is realized using symmetrical Gaussian-Lorentzian equations with Shirley-type background. 2.3 Electrochemical characterizations In the preparation of Lithium-oxygen battery, the air electrodes were fabricated by mixing the active material, Super P and PVDF binder with a weight ratio of 4:4:2 in NMP as solvent. The resulting slurries were sprayed onto a nickel foam and then dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C overnight. The slurry loading was controlled to be 5 mg for all batteries. Swagelok-type cells were assembled in a glove box filled with Ar. Lithium foil (200 μm thickness), 1 M LiTFSI in TEGDME (140 μl), and glass fiber were used as the anode, electrolyte, and separator respectively. Then, the assembled batteries were transferred to a vessel filled with oxygen. The battery was subjected to galvanostatic discharge-charge cycles in the same atmosphere using a Neware battery testing system. The cut-off voltage in full discharge–charge cycle was set to 2.0–4.5 V and the cycling capacity cut-off was constrained to 600 mAhg−1 cathode with a low voltage limit of 2.0 V. 3 Results and discussion The XRD patterns of the samples are shown in Fig. 1 a. The two broad diffraction peaks at 2θ values of around 26° and 43° are direct proof of the amorphous nature of the nitrogen doped carbon samples. The carbon results from the carbonization of Tannic acid without the presence of graphitization catalyst, so only amorphous carbon is produced instead of graphitic carbon. Although no well-established graphitic crystal lattice is formed, the amorphous carbon still contains some discontinuous graphitic lattice. The degree of such discontinuous can be revealed by the intensity of the peak at 26°. During the carbonization of Tannic acid, ZnCl2 is added as a pore former which helps the formation of micro/meso pores to increase the surface area of the carbon material. Fig. 1b demonstrates the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms and pore size distribution of the four nitrogen doped carbon (inset). All of the four isotherms belong to the Langmuir type, indicating the mesopore structure of carbon materials. It is noted that the pore size mainly distributes in the range of 2–5 nm. The total BET surface area of the samples are 879.32, 950.21, 911.12 and 1121.28 m2 g−1 for NEC1 to NEC12, respectively. The high surface area comes from the abundant meso pores created by ZnCl2. The morphology and structure of the samples are studied with TEM. The high-resolution TEM images in Fig. 2 show the morphology of the nitrogen doped carbon, which are not carbon particles or spheres, instead the samples are composed by carbon flakes with abundant pores. The structure is determined by the preparation method where Tannic acid is carbonized with ZnCl2 creating pores. There are no difference between the morphology of the four samples with different nitrogen content, which is easy to understand because they are prepared by the same method. The dispersion rings in the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns inset in Fig. 2 clearly reveal the amorphous structure of the four samples, which is in well accordance with the XRD results. Raman spectroscopy is used to study the ratio of sp2 (graphite-like) bond to sp3 (diamond-like) bond in the carbon materials, which leads to great versatility in the properties [38]. The Raman spectra of amorphous carbon display two sharp peaks corresponding with the G band at around 1580–1600 cm−1 and D band at around 1350 cm−1, which is associated to the vibration of sp2-bonded carbon atoms in a 2D hexagonal lattice and the vibration of carbon atoms with dangling bonds in plane terminations of the disordered graphite respectively. The relative intensities of these two bands (ID/IG) depend on the type of graphitic materials and reflect the degree of graphitization and the number of defects [39]. As demonstrated in Fig. 3 a the ID/IG values of NEC1, NEC4, NEC6 are 0.96, 1.02 and 0.98 respectively, which means the defect degree of the three samples are similar. NEC12 showed a much higher ID/IG value of 1.13, indicating more defects. The higher ID/IG than 1.0 is a direct proof of the low graphitization degree of the sample, which is in accordance with the XRD and TEM results. The XPS analysis of C 1s spectrum in Fig. 3b also coordinated with the results of Raman spectrum, in which the peaks around 284.6 eV, 285.7 eV, 287.3 eV and 289.2 eV matched CC/CC bonds, CO/CN bonds, CO bonds and COOR bonds, respectively [40–41]. The functional groups are origin of defects in the carbon material. Fig. 3c compared the ratio of different functional groups such as oxygen groups and nitrogen groups in the four carbon samples. It is interesting to note that the change of the content of defects follows the same trend with the ID/IG values in the Raman spectra. NEC12 has the highest content of functional groups, which could explain its largest number of defects among the four. To figure out the details of functional groups and the kinds of the defects contained in the carbon materials, we analyzed the XPS spectrum of N 1 s (Fig. 4 a) and O1s (Fig. 4d). According to the analysis of O1s, the oxygen species include carbonyl groups (CO: 531 eV), phenol and/or ether groups (COH/COC: 533 eV) and chemisorbed water and/or O2 (H2O/O2: 535 eV)[42]. The statistical data of O species in Fig. 4c showed almost horizontal curves of the content of different oxygen functional groups in different samples, indicating that the effect of oxygen defects to the performance of Lithium-oxygen batteries could be eliminated. Then we have to focus on the influence of nitrogenous defects and try to find out the relations between their content and the performance of Lithium-oxygen batteries. N1s spectra are shown in Fig. 4a with five component peaks, which are ascribed to pyridinic-N (~398.2 eV), amino-N (~398.5 eV), pyrrolic-N (~400.1 eV), graphited-N (~400.6 eV) and oxidized-N (~403.0 eV) [40,43]. Fig. 4b summarizes the content of different kinds of nitrogen functional groups in different samples. The general trend is that nearly all the contents of nitrogenous components increase with the total nitrogen contents. It is difficult to tell the exact effect of each individual nitrogen functional groups. This work focuses on the relationship between the total nitrogen contents (1.31%, 4.35%, 6.55% and 11.82%) and the battery performance. The tests of Lithium-oxygen batteries were conducted in a sealed chamber filled with pure oxygen gas. The batteries were fully discharged and charged with a current density of 200 mA g−1 with no limit in capacity but a limited voltage window from 2 V to 4.5 V. As shown in Fig. 5 a, the discharging capacity increased with the nitrogen content from 4200 mA g−1 of NEC1 to the largest capacity of 7250 mA g−1 of NEC6. The result is consistent with previous work by Sun who explained this phenomenon by the effect of nitrogen doping into the carbon material.24 The increase in capacity does not follow a linear relationship with the content of nitrogen, this is a phenomena that is not observed or reported before. As the sample with the highest nitrogen content, the capacity of NEC12 showed a dramatical decrease to 5800 mA g−1. This is explained by the increased side reaction which leads to higher overpotential and finally leads to decreased capacity during the discharging/charging process. Fig. 5a shows the deep discharging/charging curves of the samples. In the shallow discharging/charging parts of the curves the discharging potentials are 2.6 V and the charging potentials 4.0 V for the four samples with not big difference. In the shallow discharging/charging stage there is almost no by-product and the electrons are transferred in lithium peroxide, the overpotential begins to increase with the ongoing of discharging/charging cycle.44 In the test of Lithium-oxygen battery the deep discharging and charging process could lead to severe polarization, which could cause more side reactions and degradation of the electrode. So only limited small capacity is used to realize shallow discharging and charging to reveal the activity of the material. Since only the initial recharging stage is affected by the N content, so we choose a limited capacity that can well show the electrochemical performance of materials and identify the distinctions of different carbon material. In the capacity limited test (600 mA g−1) with a current density of 200 mA g−1, noticeable differences among the four discharging/charging curves could be found in the initial charge state as shown in Fig. 5b. It is noted NEC6 showed the smallest overpotential, while NEC1 showed the highest overpotential, and the overpotential of NEC12 is between NEC1 and NEC6. This is in the same trend with capacity in Fig. 5a. The overpotential is determined by the activity of the nitrogen doped carbon in the ORR/OER process in the Lithium-oxygen battery [45–46]. The overpotentials follow the reverse trend with capacity in relation with nitrogen contents: decreasing with the increase of nitrogen content until NEC6, then increasing with nitrogen content to NEC12. It is noted that the recharge platform is similar after 1000mAh/g. The recharge process is related with the OER, the activity of the catalyst determines the overpotential of OER. The kinetic controlled region, corresponding to the initial stage of OER is particularly influenced by the activity of the catalyst. In fact, Fig. 5b can be treated as an enlarged part of Fig. 5a in the kinetic controlled region. According to reference, the recharge process is also influenced by the delithiation of Li2O2 which is devided into two stages, the first stage is the delithiation of the very surface sub-nm thickness of Li2O2, which can be used to explain the difference of the initial stage of the recharge curve. Then the plateau region is attributed to the bulk delithiation of Li2O2 underneath the surface, which is not sensitive to the catalyst [44]. Fig. 5c demonstrated the cyclability of Lithium-oxygen battery with different nitrogen content under a current density of 200 mA g−1 with a limited specific capacity of 600 mA g−1 and a cut-off voltage from 2 V to 4.5 V. The cyclability of Lithium-oxygen battery increases with the increase in nitrogen content to NEC6 with the best cyclic performance of around 420 h (71 cycles). On the contrary NEC12 had a much worst cyclic performance, even worse than NEC1. when compared with NEC6 following the similar discipline with overpotential. The cyclability and overpotential are determined by the ORR/OER kinetics of the catalyst and the side reaction [47–49]. The side reactions include the decomposition reactions of the electrolyte and cathode materials especially for carbon materials on which isolated films on the active sites are formed, increasing the resistance of electron transfer [50–51]. The high capacity, low overpotential and good cyclability of NEC6 should come from its good ORR/OER catalytic activity and its resistance to the side reaction. This is also the reason for the poor performance of NEC12, where high amount of active sites introduced by high nitrogen content can catalyze the decomposition of the electrolyte and forming isolated Li2CO3 film. Side reactions are studied to explain above phenomenon. There are a few methods to detect the side reaction. For example, gas chromatography (GC) is used to analyze the gaseous products generated during the charging step. After a side reaction free charging process the emitted gas should be only oxygen, and the detection of carbon dioxide indicates the decomposition of the electrolyte or carbon [52–53]. The side reaction is also studied by analyzing the by-products by XRD, XPS or other in-situ testing technologies [49,54–55]. We designed an electrochemical method to study the by-products. The Lithium-oxygen battery was tested by scanning linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) from 3.50 V to 5.50 V without discharging, and the Lithium-oxygen battery was well sealed to secure no contact with oxygen to exclude the influence of oxygen or superoxide ion O−. The results are shown in Fig. 6 a, an obvious peak can be found at around 4.02 V for NEC12 while not such a peak for the other three samples. In combination with the lower capacity/cyclability and higher overpotential of NEC12 compared with NEC6, such a peak at 4.02 V is a direct proof of the decomposition of the electrolyte or oxidation of carbon. The obvious increase of current density at potentials higher than 4.5 V corresponds with the decomposition of the electrolyte or carbon. The onset potential of such decomposition on NEC12 is 4.5 V, which is more negative than 4.88 V of NEC1, NEC4 and NEC6. This proves NEC12 is more active in the decomposition of electrolyte or oxidation of carbon, which can be explained by the high nitrogen content. As a reference carbon paper without doped nitrogen is also tested, the much positive potential proves all nitrogen doped carbon makes the decomposition of electrolyte or oxidation of carbon easier, which is the main cause of the side reactions. The work function (Φ) is the minimum energy for the inner electrons to escape from the nucleus. A low work function implies low energetic barrier for the electrons to be motivated and higher work function indicates higher stability (difficult to lose electrons) [56]. UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was used to estimate the work function of the carbon materials. As demonstrated in Fig. 6b, the work function of NEC1, NEC4, NEC6 and NEC12 are 4.63, 4.74, 4.71 and 5.17 eV, respectively. The value of the work function increases with the nitroge content [57]. The highest work function of NEC12 means the carbon in NEC12 is the most stable in resistance to decomposition in the Lithium-oxygen discharging/charging environment. It can be summarized that higher nitrogen content in carbon leads to higher work function, which makes the carbon material more stable. So the side reaction of NEC12 in Fig. 6a is deduced to be the decomposition of the electrolyte instead of carbon. 4 Conclusions This work prepares nitrogen doped carbon with different nitrogen content. The relation between nitrogen content and performance of Lithium-oxygen battery is studied. The best Lithium-oxygen battery performance with the lowest charge overpotential and the best long-term stability of 71 cycles over 420 h is found. The high performance is explained by the improved ORR/OER catalytic activity introduced by nitrogen doping. Together with the favored improvements in activity, nitrogen doping also makes the carbon material more active in the decomposition of the electrolyte, leading to higher overpotential and lower cyclability. The cycling stability of Lithium-oxygen battery is still far from commercial requirements, the results of this work can give some contribution to the solution to this problem.

        "dc:description": "This work reveals a balance between the improved oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction activity of nitrogen doped carbon and the concomitant activity in the decomposition of the electrolyte of the Lithium-oxygen battery. The capacity and cyclability of Lithium-oxygen battery increase with the nitrogen content to a vertex, then decrease with higher nitrogen content. The largest capacity of 7250 mA g−1 and the best long-term stability of 71 cycles over 420 h are found in a catalyst with proper content of nitrogen. It is also found nitrogen doping can improve the work function of the carbon material, making it more resistant to decomposition in the working conditions of Lithium-oxygen battery.",
