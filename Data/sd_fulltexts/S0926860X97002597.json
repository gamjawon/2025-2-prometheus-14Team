One way or another, all these factors influence the catalytic activity of these systems, but catalyst concentration and stirring speed are the most important ones. In the case of heterogeneous catalysts of the same metallocenes, the most pronounced influence is related to the type of support and its porous nature. The influence of the support on activity and morphology is shown. C( 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. Keywords: Metallocene; Zirconium; Polymerization; Silica support; Ethylene; Catalyst 1. Introduction Metallocene compounds are becoming an important class of catalysts and opening a new field for the synthesis of olefins. This is due to the potential that these catalysts have for manipulating the molecular structure of the polymers thus formed. Many catalytic systems, as well as a-olefins, have been reported to be useful for producing polymers with special properties [1,2].Among the metallocenes that have been studied, the chiral ansa- *Corresponding author. 0926-860X/98/$19.00 <c-,) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Several studies have shown that the type of catalyst has an important effect on the structure and molecular weight of the final polymer formed [5-9]. Other researches have studied some specific parameter for a particular catalyst, such as the effect of monomer concentration on propene polymerization [10]. For heterogeneous catalysts there are also studies, particularly for propene polymerization, showing the specific effect of the support on the activity, molecular weight and microstructure properties [ 11,12]. How- 208 R. Quijada et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 166 (1998) 207-213 ever, very few studies have shown how the type of reactor, and the stirring speed, catalyst concentration and amount of zirconium in the support affect the catalytic activity and the morphology of the final polymer. Following our research work related to the study of the different factors that can influence the catalytic activity and the morphology of the polymer [ 13-15), we have studied how the different parameters affect the reaction and the polymer. Two types of metallocene supported catalysts, CO) EtIndzZrC12 and Ind2ZrC12, on different supports and at different catalyst concentrations have been compared with the unsupported catalysts. Also, para meters such as catalyst concentration and stirring speed have been optimized. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials Commercial toluene was purified by refluxing over metallic sodium, with benzophenone as indicator. Polymerization-grade ethylene was deoxygenated and dried by passage through columns of BASF R3-11 catalyst and 4 molecular sieves. ES 70 microspherical and EP 10 granular porous silica (Crossfield), and nonporous Aerosil 200 [16] were used as supports. Prior to use, they were heated overnight at 150 under vacuum, and then calcina ted at 500 for 3 h and stored in a nitrogen atmos phere. Methylaluminoxane (MAO) and the metallocene catalysts (i) Et(Ind)ZZrCl2 and (ii) (Ind)ZZrC12 (Fig. la) all supplied by Witco, were used directly. All manipulations were carried out in an inert nitrogen atmosphere. 2.2. Preparation of the heterogeneous catalyst (Fig. 1 b) The metallocene was impregnated on the support by refluxing for 3 h at 130 using toluene as a solvent. The resulting solid was carefully washed with toluene, ensuring the absence of homogeneous parts and then extracted, filtered and dried under vacuum at 60 for 6 h. The zirconium content was measured by induc tively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy. (a) OH -OH Oci Zr -cl O Hx~ Ind ~ /cl kid/ ~ Cl Ind: Iil hid k p O---Zr In/ hd I Ind \\cl Fig. 1.

Polymerization For the polymerization of ethylene, 250 cm3 of toluene, 14 cm 3 of MAO for the heterogeneous and 2-3 cm 3 for the homogeneous catalyst, and between 200 and 900 mg of catalyst were placed in a 0.5 1 glass or autoclave reactor. Polymerization was normally carried out at 60 for 30 min. at an absolute monomer pressure of 0.6 (glass reactor) or 1.6 bar (autoclave reactor).

Results and discussion 3.1. Homogeneous catalysts The study of reaction parameters in this type of polymerization implies obtaining optimum conditions of catalyst concentration for reactions in a glass reactor and in an autoclave, as well as other optimization parameters of the process such as stirring speed.

Metallocene rpm Polymer (g) Activity (KgPE/ molZr x h x P) nant and the number of active sites that can start the polymerization become more prevalent, so that the Zr concentration is the factor that limits the catalytic activity. However, the operating conditions in each reactor were standardized and used in later experiments. Table 2 shows the results of the study of stirring speed with two types of homogeneous metallocenes in a glass reactor. It is seen that the activity depends on the stirring speed for the two types of catalysts studied (EtInd2ZrC1z and Ind2ZrC12). The highest activity values were obtained when a speed of 1000 rpm was used for both catalysts. This increase in activity can be due to the destruction of the possible agglomeration or to the destruction of the monolayer formed through the catalyst particle. This phenomenon has already been observed when an increase in active center concentration in the reactor decreases the activity. Moreover, it was found that the bridged metallocene had higher activity than the unbridged one, confirming previously published results [13]. 500 8.62 15 123 EtlndzZrCl2 700 11.44 20061 3.2.

Table 1 shows that the best operating conditions for autoclave and glass reactors are different. For the former it was found that the optimal amount is 8.0 x 10-7 mol of Zr. However, at that concentration there is no polymerization in the glass reactor. On the other hand, at the optimum concentration for the glass reactor, the activity in the autoclave is lower. This may be due to diffusion factors of the monomers in the active mass of the polymer that is being formed (agglomeration or formation of compact polymer layers). Moreover, it must be considered that there is a limitation on the working pressure which, in the case of the glass reactor, cannot be higher than 0.6 bar. As the catalyst concentration decreases, the diffusion effect mentioned previously becomes less predomi- Three types of supports characterized by their specific surface area, porosity and particle size were studied. The results of the respective catalysts and their influence on the catalytic activity, and the morphological correlation between support and polymer are shown. The different types of support and the influence of the percentage of Zr (catalysts) on the catalytic activity are also studied.

Aerosil is a nonporous silica with a very small particle size. This peculiarity has some influence on the activity of the supported catalyst, as will be seen from Table 4. The results of the pore size distribution for the ES 70 and EP 10 supports are shown in Fig. 4. EP 10 has an average pore radius of ,110 which corresponds to a classification as mesoporous. On the other hand, ES 70 has a nonuniform distribution, with an average value for its pore radius of 8 and 100 which correspond to the microporous and mesoporous regions, respectively. Fig. 5 shows the results of pore-size distribution for the ES 70EtInd2ZrC12 supported metallocene.

While for the support that percentage is 14% and 86%, respectively, for the micro- and mesoporous regions, for the catalyst it is 3% and 97%, pointing to microporous blocking caused by impregnation. This variation or disappearance of micropores may have a very important effect on catalytic activity, because the larger the pore volume the better the chance for the polymer chain to grow at the active sites (Zr) that exist in the mesopores - the ones that are found predominantly in the catalyst - approaching the activity shown by catalysts linked to nonporous supports that are discussed in Table 4. Table 4 shows the results of the correlation between the amount of zirconium catalyst incorporated and its activity for the two metallocenes, EtInd2ZrC12 and Ind2ZrC12, on three types of supports. Higher values of incorporated Zr found in this work were obtained 212 R.

Magnification 320x. while looking for a correlation between the metallocene and surface OH groups in the silica, making possible the incorporation of 7% of Zr on the support, as shown in Table 4 ([17]). This study was made in order to see if there is any influence of the amount of Zr on the support and the activity. It can be seen that the percentage of Zr incorporated is not a predominant factor for either of the metallocenes, since similar values were obtained for low and high amounts of Zr. Activity values of 106 and 119 were obtained for different percentages of Zr on the ES 70 support and values of 96 and 108 for EP 10 at low Zr percentages. The reason for this phenomenon is that only those Zr atoms that are really exposed on the surface would be the active centers, and for high Zr values a large percentage would be trapped in the smaller volume pores. The Aerosil support showed the highest activity for both catalysts. The nonporous structure of Aerosil is probably an advantage in obtaining well-distributed zirconium atoms on the surface, since there is a directed interaction between the active center and the incoming monomer [15]. Small variations are observed between the unbridged Ind2ZrC12 and the bridged EtInd2ZrC12 metallocenes, the latter being the more active one for the three supports used, R. Quijada et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 166 (1998) 207-213 confirming the studies made for homogeneous catalysts [18]. In general, supported metallocene catalysts have shown much lower activities as compared with the homogeneous catalyst systems. Regarding the morphology, it can be said that the final polymer is a replica of the original support, as shown in Fig. 6 for ES 70 and EP 10.

        "dc:description": "The catalytic activities of two metallocene compounds, EtInd2ZrCl2 and Ind2ZrCl2, in the polymerization of ethylene depend heavily on certain parameters, such as Zr concentration in the reaction, type of the reactor, and stirring speed for homogeneous catalysts. One way or another, all these factors influence the catalytic activity of these systems, but catalyst concentration and stirring speed are the most important ones. In the case of heterogeneous catalysts of the same metallocenes, the most pronounced influence is related to the type of support and its porous nature. The influence of the support on activity and morphology is shown.",
