Singh *, S.B. Kumar Catalysiz Division, National Chemical Laborato~, Pune-411 008, India Received 22 March 1994; revised 29 September 1994; accepted 18 November 1994 Abstract The liquid phase chlorination of toluene with gaseous chlorine using various zeolites as catalysts has been studied. Zeolite K-L is found to be more selective than the other zeolites and the conventional catalyst, FeC13. The reaction over SiO2 shows lower para-selectivity compared to the zeolites. The influence of various parameters such as the type of zeolite, nature of the solvent, reaction temperature, catalyst concentration, C1CHzCOOH/catalyst ratio and chlorine gas flow rate on the para/ortho- isomer ratio in the chlorination of toluene are reported. The yield ofpara-chlorotoluene is significantly enhanced by increasing the reaction temperature (studied up to 383 K) and the catalyst amount. The highestpara/ortho ratio (6.66) was obtained over zeolite K-L when a mixture of 1,2-dichloroethane/ toluene in a molar ratio of 1.7 was used. The HC1 formed during the reaction deactivates K-L. The selectivity (para/ortho) decreases marginally with increasing conversion in zeolite K-L catalyzed chlorination. Keywords: Para-selectivity; Toluene chlorination; Zeolites 1. Introduction The chlorination of toluene is significant from the industrial point of view, the most important product being para-chlorotoluene which is used as an intermediate in the pesticides, pharmaceutical, peroxide, dye and other industries [ 1 ]. It is used primarily in the manufacture of p-chlorobenzotrifluoride, a key intermediate in dinitroaniline and diphenyl ether herbicides [ 2,3 ]. Reaction of toluene with chlo- rine in the presence of conventional Lewis acid catalysts (A1C13, TIC14, ZrC14, FeC13 and SbC15) yields mixtures of monochlorotoluenes containing less than 30% of the para-isomer [4-6].

Kurnar /At)plied Catalysis A: General 126 (1995)2~38 are obtained through the use of certain specific metal sulfides or co-catalyst systems consisting of special metal salts and sulfur, inorganic sulfides or divalent sulfur compounds [7-14]. However, these catalyst systems produce larger amounts of di- and tri- substituted products. Although zeolites have emerged recently as prom- ising catalysts for the selective halogenation of aromatic compounds, little has been published on this subject [ 15-20] and most of the literature available consists of patents [21-26]. Botta et al. observed that zeolite catalysts, particularly L-~ype, shift the isomer ratio significantly towards para-substitution in the chlorination of biphenyl [ 15 ]. The objective of the present work is to chlorinate tolu, ene with large para selectivity. We report herein the results of the influence or, various zeolites, monochloroacetic acid, catalyst concentration, reaction temperature, chlorine gas flow rate, nature and amount of the solvent (1,2-dichloroethane) and reuse of the catalyst on the para-selectivity in the chlorination of toluene. In order to see the influence of various parameters on the p/o selectivity, the results were compared at nearly similar levels of conversion and uv.~der identical conditions. It is important to note here that similar levels of conversions were obtained by varying the time of the reaction. The results obtained over d!ifferent catalysts are compared with that over the conventional catalysts, viz., FeC13 and SiO2. 2. Experimental Samples of the H-mordenite, Na-Y and NaL-X were provided by Laporte Inorgan- ics (Cheshire, UK), ZSM-5, beta and K-L were synthesized as per published procedures [27-29]. All samples were found to be highly crystalline. The zeolites were converted into their potassium form by a standard ion-exchange process using a 1 M solution of KNO3 (pH = 7-8) at 353 K. Zeolite H.K-L was prepared from the K-L by repeated exchanges with ammonium nitrate solution and further calci- nation at 773 K. Analyses for silicon, alu~minium and potassium were made using a combination of wet chemical and atornic absorption (Hitachi Z-800) methods. The chemical compositions of the zeolites are given in Table 1. The zeolite samples were activated at 438 K for at least 2 h before use in experiments so as to maintain dry reaction conditions. Anhydrous and analytical grade (AR) chemicals and solvents were used in all experiments. The liquid phase catalytic chlorination of toluene was performed at atmospheric pressure in a glass reactor, equipped with a magnetic stirrer, a reflux condenser, CI2 or N2 gas feed line and a septum. Toluene (0.32 mol), activated catalyst (1.63 g) and mono-chloroacetic acid (0.32 g) were introduced in the reactor, in the order mentioned. The mixture was then stirred and heated to attain the reaction temperature in the presence of nitrogen gas. The nitrogen gas was disconnected and chlorine gas was supplied at a rate of 0.08 mol/h to conduct the reaction. The chlorination was followed by taking samples of reaction mixture at suitable intervals. The reaction products were analyzed by a Hewlett-Packard model A.P. Singh, S.B.

Results and discussion 3.1. Influence of catalyst The chlorination of toluene was studied over various catalysts and the results are presented in Table 1. For comparison, experiments were carried out over FeC13, amorphous silica and in the absence of any catalyst. The major products of the reactions were para-chlorotoluene (PCT) and ortho-chlorotoluene (OCT). Small quantities of benzyl chloride (BC) and polychlorinated toluenes (others) were also detected. Meta-chlorotoluene isomer was found in small amounts ( < 1%) in all the cases. Similar products have been reported by Kamigata et al. [30] in the chlorination of toluene using conventional catalysts. The formation of PCT and OCT over various zeolite catalysts takes place by parallel reactions [ 18 ]. The di-, tri- and tetra-chlorotoluenes are obtained by sec- ondary consecutive reactions [ 18] of the monochlorotoluenes. The results show a strong influence of different zeolite catalysts on the PCT product selectivity and para/ortho (p/o)-isomer ratio which varies between 26.5 and 74.5% and 0.69 and 30 A.P.

Thep/o ratios over FeCI3, silica and in the absence of any catalyst were found to be 0.49, 0.54 and 0.42, respectively. The results obtained over various zeolites and SiO2 show that reaction takes place both inside and outside the zeolite channels (Table 1 ). The catalytic sites on the outer surface are not selective. These results are in good agreement with those reported by de la Vega et al. [31] in the bromination of toluene. The p/o selectivity increased by a factor of 6.8 when zeolite K-L was used instead of FeC13. In the present study, zeolite K-L exhibited the highest p/o selectivity (3.32) in the presence of mon- ochloroacetic acid, however, p/o ratios over K-L in the absence of monochloroac- etic acid and acidic H.K-L were found to be 1.76 and 0.87, respectively. A similar behaviour of C1CH2COOH in the chlorination of biphenyl over zeolite K-L was reported earlier [15]. The role of monochloroacetic acid in enhancing the para- selectivity is not clear yet. The acidic H.K-L gave a lowerp/o ratio (0.87) compared to the basic K-L zeolite (p/o = 3.32) and this probably indicates that strong acidity is not preferred for the selective para-chlorination of toluene [ 32]. The formation of some amount of benzyl chloride at 353 K even in the presence of catalyst may be related to the poorly dark experimental conditions which may initiate the free radical reactions. The side chain chlorination of toluene takes place in the absence of any catalyst, resulting in the formation of benzyl chloride ( > 90%) which may be attributed to the photochlorination of-CH3 group of toluene [33,34]. Minor amounts of PCT and OCT are also produced in the absence of any catalyst which may be attributed to a competing electrophilic processes [ 34]. Van Dijk et al. [ 19] studied the liquid phase halogenation of alkyl and halob- enzenes using X-type zeolites. They observed higher p/o selectivity compared to the FeC13 catalyst and suggested that highly selective para-substitution may be due to a specific orientation of the substrate in the pores of zeolites resulting in steric A.P. Singh, S.B. Kumar /Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (1995) 27-38 31 hinderance at the ortho position. In addition, they have suggested that strong electrostatic forces in the crystal lattice, especially near the cationic centers, may favour the polarization of the halogen and/or the substrate. Wortel et al. [ 18] and Botta et al. [ 15 ] have also reported that size, charge and position of the cations and electrostatic forces produced by them in the zeolite channels may also be responsible for the higher selectivity for para products in the chlorination of aromaticsThus the results obtained in the liquid phase chlorination of toluene (in the present study) may not be due to geometry related shape selectivity alone [35 ]. Electrophilic aromatic chlorination takes place over Lewis and BrCnsted acid sitesThese sites polarize the chlorine molecule by heterolytic dissociation into CI+ for the electrophilic chlorination of aromatics, Eqs. (4) and (5) [36]. The side chain such as the s-chlorination and ring chlorination of toluene take place by radical [Eqs. (1)-(3)] and ionic mechanisms [Eqs. (4)-(6)], respectively [33,34].

It is reported [33] that silyloxy radicals are produced by the homolytic opening of O3SiOA103 structure of zeolites into O3SiO + O3Al. These radicals initiate the radical chain reactions. The highest concentration of such centers is expected with aluminium rich zeolites. The catalysts used in the study 32 A.P. Singh, S.B.

Further studies carried out on the influence of various parameters on the p/o selectivity over zeolite K-L are reported in the following sections. 3.2. Influence of solvent The reactions were carried out over zeolite K-L in the presence of C1CH2COOH using different solvents such as CH2C12, C1CHzCH2C1, CHC13 and CC14. The results of the solvent effect on the formation of the more useful p-isomer are summarized in Table 2. The best results were obtained with the use of 1,2-dichloroethane at 353 K (p/o = 4.05). The other solvents (Table 2) gave lower p-selectivity compared to the values obtained even in the neat chlorination of toluene. The higher p/o ratio observed in 1,2-dichloroethane may be due to its (1,2-dichloroethane) higher dielectric constant facilitating the rupture of the C1-C1 bond to produce the C1 + (electrophile) [37]. Others [ 15,16] have suggested that solvents (like 1,2-dich- loroethane and dichloromethane) may influence the activation of the reactants or affect diffusion and transport process in the zeolite channels. 3.3. Influence of 1,2-dichloroethane/toluene mol ratio Experiments were carried out with three different 1,2-dichloroethane/toluene (tool) ratios keeping the concentration of toluene constant (0.16 mol). The results are reported in Table 3. A continuous increase in the p/o selectivity was observed as the 1,2-dichloroethane/toluene ratio increases. The highest p/o selectivity (6.66) was obtained with the use of 1.7 mol ratio of 1,2-dichloroethane/toluene mixture, however, earlier report shows lower p/o selectivity (4.05) over zeolite catalysts [20]. 3.4. Influence of reaction temperature Influence of reaction temperature was investigated on the p/o selectivity using various solvents (Table 2). A pronounced increase in p/o ratio from 0.82 to 4.05, A.P. Singh, S.B.

In addition, experiments were carried out at different temperatures in the absence of any solvent over zeolite K-L to find out the optimum temperature for the maxi- mum yield of PCT (Fig. 1 ). At lower temperatures, the increased formation of OCT, BC and polychlorinated toluenes decrease the selectivity for PCT. The selec- tivity for PCT and p/o ratio increase steadily with increase in reaction temperature from 313 to 363 K. Beyond 363 K, a small increase in the PCT selectivity was noticed. It has been reported [ 38,39 ] that the reaction temperature influences the overall halogen order which may increase the para/ortho-isomer ratio at higher temperatures. 3.5. p/o selectivi~ as a function of toluene conversion The results of the effect of conversion of toluene on the p/o-isomer ratio at different reaction temperatures are depicted in Fig. 2. The p/o selectivity is slightly higher at lower conversion levels and decreases marginally with the progress of the reaction. However, de la Vega et al. [ 17] had observed a sharp decrease in p/o selectivity with increase in toluene conversion over zeolite Na-Y. These results suggest that the zeolite plays important role in determining the p/o ratios. 34 A.P. Singh, S.B.

Influence of concentration of catalyst Fig. 3 shows the effect of concentration of zeolite K-L in the range of 0 to 7.6 g/mol toluene on the p/o ratio and product selectivity. The percentage of PCT in products increases with increase in catalyst concentration up to 5 g/mol toluene. A large yield of benzyl chloride ( > 90%) is obtained in the absence of any catalyst. These results indicate that K-L catalyzes mainly the ring chlorination of toluene. 3.7. Influence of ClCH2COOH/catalyst ratio Fig. 4 shows how the C1CHzCOOH/catalyst ratio affects product selectivity and p/o ratio over zeolite K-L in the chlorination of toluene. In the present study, the highest selectivity for PCT was obtained when a proper combination of C1CHzCOOH and zeolite K-L [21] was used as the catalyst. The selectivity for PCT and p/o ratio increase with increasing C1CH2COOH/catalyst ratios from 0 to 0.2, whereas the selectivity for OCT decreases. The maximum p/o-isomer ratio was obtained using 0.2 C1CHzCOOH/catalyst ratio. Further increase in C1CHzCOOH / catalyst ratio ( > 0.2) resulted in lower p / o selectivity and formation of larger amounts of benzyl chloride and polychlorinated toluenes. These data reveal that the p/o selectivity is markedly dependent on the C1CHzCOOH/catalyst ratio. 3.8.

A.P. Singh, S.B. Kumar / Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (1995)27-38 37 a slight decrease in p/o-isomer ratio was observed which may be attributed to the potassium exchange of zeolite samples by HC1 (formed during the reaction), Eq. (7). The ion-exchange process changes the basic zeolite K-L into a less para- selective acidic H.K-L. The chemical analyses results show that the deactivation of the zeolite is related to the ion-exchange process (Table 4). A minor dealumination from the zeolite framework was also observed after each reaction, (Table 4). However, X-ray diffraction analyses of the fresh and all used samples did not show any reduction in the crystallinity of the zeolite. These results are consistent with the earlier reports [ 17,18 ]. ZeO1 - K + HC1 ~ ZeO1 - H + KC1 (7) 4. Conclusion In the present work we have shown that chlorination of toluene with chlorine gas is also catalyzed by zeolites. The liquid phase chlorination of toluene takes place both on the external surface of the zeolite and inside the zeolite channels. para-chlorotoluene is produced in high selectivity when zeolite K-L is used along with monochloroacetic acid. 1,2-dichloroethane when used as the solvent enhances the p/o selectivity significantly. Comparison with a FeC13 catalyst shows that the K-L zeolite is far superior for the chlorination of toluene. Among zeolite catalysts, the largest yield of benzyl chloride is obtained over K-X presumably due to a radical mechanism. Larger p/o ratios are obtained by increasing the reaction temperature and catalyst concentration. The selectivity to para-chlorotoluene decreases with an increase in toluene conversion and C12 flow rate. Reuse of the zeolite K-L shows that catalyst deactivates due to the K-exchange of zeolite by HC1.

The liquid phase chlorination of toluene with gaseous chlorine using various zeolites as catalysts has been studied. Zeolite K-L is found to be more selective than the other zeolites and the conventional catalyst, FeCl3. The reaction over SiO2 shows lower para-selectivity compared to the zeolites. The influence of various parameters such as the type of zeolite, nature of the solvent, reaction temperature, catalyst concentration, ClCH2COOH/ catalyst ratio and chlorine gas flow rate on the para/ortho-isomer ratio in the chlorination of toluene are reported. The yield of para-chlorotoluene is significantly enhanced by increasing the reaction temperature (studied up to 383 K) and the catalyst amount. The highest para/ ortho ratio (6.66) was obtained over zeolite K-L when a mixture of 1,2-dichloroethane/ toluene in a molar ratio of 1.7 was used. The HCl formed during the reaction deactivates K-L. The selectivity (para/ ortho) decreases marginally with increasing conversion in zeolite K-L catalyzed chlorination. Keywords Para-selectivity Toluene chlorination Zeolites References [1] J.I.
