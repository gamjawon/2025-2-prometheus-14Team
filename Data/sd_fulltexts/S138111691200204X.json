Keywords 4,4′-Bipyridine phosphotungtic salt Electrochemical Catalytic polymerization Recoverable 1 Introduction Heteropolyoxometalates (HPMs) had attracted much attention in recent years for the potential catalysis application [1–5]. HPMs had been found to be excellent catalysts for a number of chemical reactions, e.g. hydration [6–11], alkylation [12–17], transesterification [18–21], Prins reaction [22–24], etc. However, the only polymerization reaction initiated by HPMs, to date, was cycle-opening polymerization of epoxy compounds such as epoxyethane, epoxypropane, and tetrahydrofuran [25,26]. Our research group was the first to report the polymerization of styrene [27,28], which was the only polymerization example for vinyl monomers. Styrene polymerization initiated by HPMs was excellent, and followed cationic polymerization theory [27]. But the reaction carried out so rapidly that disadvantage to both experiment research and plant application. This limited the use of a wide range of vinyl monomers in polymerization. As such it needs an excellent method to address the problem of HPMs mediated cationic polymerization. One of the best methods was selecting a suitable ligand to stable the active center during polymerization. In present paper, 4,4′-Bipyridine was used for modifying the stability of 12-tungstophosphoric acid. The compound was structurally characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The electrochemical property was determined by electrochemistry workstation. The catalysis activity was studied in photo-polymerization of vinyl monomers. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and instruments All chemicals purchased were of reagent grade and used without further purification. The elemental analyses for C, H and N were performed with an EA1110-CHNS elemental analyser. The IR spectra were obtained on a NICOLET380 spectrum using KBr disks in the range 4000–400cm−1. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a BRUKER Avance DPX300MHz spectrum. Polymerization was performed on a XPA-1 photochemical reactor, with 300W Hg light source, and the rolling rate was 20rpm, the wavelength of the radiation light was selected as 365nm. Molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of the polymers were measured by PL GPC 50 at 25°C using THF as eluent against polystyrene standards, flow rate: 1mL/min, sample concentration: 1mg/mL. 2.2 Catalyst preparation H3PW12O40·16.5H2O of 6.35g (0.002mol) was dissolved in 24ml of ethanol and heated at 40°C for 30min under stirring. Then 0.93g of [(C5H4)N]2 (0.006mol) in ethanol (58ml) was added to the solution dropwise under stirring. The solution was stirred continuously for 8h. The resultant precipitate was filtrated and washed with ethanol. After drying in a vacuum oven at 30°C for 12h, a white powder catalyst was obtained. Yield: 36.2mg (based on W). Anal. Calcd for C15H15N3O40PW12: C:5.77; N:1.35; H:0.48%. Found: C:5.71; N:1.29; H:0.51%. 2.3 Electrochemical property determination All electrochemical measurements were carried out with CHI 660 electrochemistry workstation. A three-electrode set up was employed for the electrochemical studies, Gold (Au) was utilized as working electrode, modified with the complex acetone solution. A platinum disk was used as the counter electrode, and the reference electrode was a saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE). Before used, the oxidized gold working electrode surfaces were generated by applying 2.0V vs. SCE for 90s in 2M NaOH solution. 2.4 Typical polymerization process The catalysis activity test of 4,4′-Bipyridine phosphotungtic salt is performed as follows: [(C5H4)N]3(PW12O40) of 0.29g (0.1mmol) was mixed with 10g of acetone in a quartz reaction tube, stirred by magnetic power. Dry nitrogen was input for about 20min to eliminate the effect of possible air, and then 0.10g (10mmol) of vinyl monomer was added. The polymerization was performed on a XPA-1 photochemical reactor, with 300W Hg light source and the rolling rate was 20rpm, the wavelength of the radiation light was selected as 365nm. The polymerization was terminated by addition of acidic methanol, The polymer product was precipitated into 50ml methanol, filtered, washed with methanol, and dried in a vacuum oven at 50°C overnight to a constant weight. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analyses of polymer samples were carried out at 25°C using THF as eluent on a Polymer Laboratory-50 instrument and calibrated using monodispersed polystyrene standards at a flow rate of 1.0ml/min. Number-average molecular weight and polydispersity of polymers were given relative to PS standards. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 IR analysis Fig. 1 shows the FT-IR spectra of the as-prepared catalysts: H3PW12O40 (a), [(C5H4)N]3(PW12O40) (b), and the catalyst after polymerization (c). Over a range of 800–1100cm−1, the absorption bands around 1080, 985, 896, and 804cm−1, corresponding to the four characteristic skeletal vibrations of the Keggin oxoanions, were observed in the FT-IR spectra of samples (a). These absorption bands are attributed to the vibrations of υas(POa), υas(WOd), υas(WOb W) in corner shared octahedra, and υas(WOc W) in edge shared octahedra, respectively [29–31]. For the FT-IR spectrum of sample (b) and (c), the absorption band at 1080cm−1 is attributed to the vibration of υas(POa), the absorption bands of υas(WOd), υas(WOb W) and υas(WOc W) shift to 980 (for b and c), 893 (for b, 895 for c), 798 (for b, 799 for c) cm−1. These shifts indicate the changes of the bond length and bond angle. Compared with the spectra of sample (a), the intensities of these bands of sample (b) and (c) did not change, which indicated two means: one is that the Keggin structure was not destroyed after modified by quaternary ammoniums; secondly, no change was found during the catalytic polymerization. The possible reason of these band changes is that the MoO6 octahedra of the polyanions were distorted in some degrees because of the influence of the outer quaternary ammonium cations. 3.2 1H NMR analysis 1H NMR analysis was an important method for studying the reactions catalyzed by phosphotungtic compound [27,32]. In Fig. 2a, the peak at 5.416ppm was attributed to the protons in phosphotungtic acid, and the peak at 2.475ppm was attributed to the solvent of CD3COCD3. That was, all of the protons in phosphotungtic acid were in the same chemical environments. Fig. 2b was the 1H NMR spectrum of 4,4′-bipyridine, 7.88ppm and 8.71ppm were attributed to H1 and H2 (see the formula in Fig. 2), and 3.38ppm was attributed to the possible structural water. After reaction (Fig. 2c), the peak at 5.416 disappeared and a new peak at 5.993ppm appeared, which might indicated the protons had transferred from phosphotungtic acid to the N atom of 4,4′-bipyridine unit. The peaks of H1 and H2 were shifted to 8.36ppm and 9.01ppm respectively. The possible reaction was deduced as follows: 3.3 Electro-chemical property analysis Fig. 3 showed cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of the aimed product in 0.5M buffer solution of HAc-NaAc with different scan rate. Three groups of redox peak could be observed, peak II and III were very small (illustrate B), while peak I was strong. Redox potential was shown at 1.08 and 0.57 when the scan rate was selected as 100mV/s. With increasing of the scan rate, the oxidation peak potential shifted to more positive and the reduction potential shifted to more negative, while the peak currents increased linearly with increasing of the square of scan rate (illustrate A). This revealed that the electrochemical behavior of the complex chemsorbed on the surface of the ligands showing diffusion confined redox process [33]. Additionally, the electrode modified by the complex had highly stability. In 0.5M buffer solution of HAc-NaAc and potential range of −0.4–1.6V, the peak currents had not any weakening after scanning for 300 times even laying aside for 2 months. This indicated the potential application in both chemical sensor and recovery catalyst. 3.4 Catalytic activity The catalytic polymerization of vinyl monomer, styrene is presented as a sample. Polymerizations of styrene with this catalyst proceed readily under a 359nm light radiation for 60min at room temperature. This is a fast and smooth reaction when compared to the polymerization initiated by phosphotungtic acid [27]. The increase in rate is manifested by a lowering of molecular weight from 9300 to 5330, and broadening of the polydispersity from 1.29 to 2.01, which is ascribed to the chain transfer reaction [34]. These observations led us to lower the reaction temperature and radiation power, in attempt to avoid excessive chain transfer reaction. Polymerization proceeds efficiently at reaction 3 reaching 92% conversion after 60min at 20°C and 300W power. When the molar ratio of monomer to initiator was doubled from 50 to 100, an approximate doubling of the Mn is observed (entries 3 and 9, Table 1 ), as would be expected for a controlling polymerization. Styrene, vinyl iso-butyl ether, methyl methacrylate, and butyl acrylate were used, as representative of the vinyl monomers, for the photo-polymerization initiated by 4,4′-bipyridine phosphotungtic salt (entries 3, 10, 11 and 12, Table 1). All reactions at 20°C and 300W showed very good first-order kinetic behavior (Fig. 4 ) indicating a low amount of chain transfer reaction under these conditions. This taken together with the relatively narrow PDI values and high Mn of the products indicates that the polymerization shows controlled characteristics. Fig. 5 shows the evolution of the Mn as a function of [M]/[I] for reaction 3, 10, 11 and 12, which increases linearly again as would be expected for controlling polymerization. 4,4′-bipyridine phosphotungtic salt is only soluble in high polar solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide, which in turn is immiscible with other organic solvents such as toluene. This allows the reaction solution to be washed with toluene so as to extract the catalyst, which allowing isolation of the catalyst from the polymer solution for potential reuse. After 10 cycle reuse in styrene polymerization (see Fig. 6 ), catalyst recovery is up to 96.7%, molecular weight and polydispersity of polystyrene retained a stable level (Mn was changed random between 6208 and 8640, PDI was changed random between 1.12 and 1.83), which indicated that 4,4′-bipyridine phosphotungtic salt was a recovery catalyst, and could repeat 10 times at least. 4 Conclusion In summary, 4,4′-bipyridine phosphotungtic salt is an excellent catalyst for the polymerization of vinyl monomers. Polymerizations show controlled characteristics, and the catalyst can be isolated from polymer product easily and reused for at least 10 times. References [1] N.R. Shiju H.M. Williams D.R.
