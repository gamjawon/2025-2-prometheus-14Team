The Co2ions replace Fe2 ions in the B sites of the inverse spinel structure of Fe204 for the former catalyst, while a relatively even distribution over A and B sites occurs for the latter. The above results are supported by X-ray diffraction (XRD). For the irregular catalysts, the activity and specific surface area increase to some extent with increasing cobalt content and decreasing atomic iron ratios (i.e. Fe2Fe3 +). For the ball-shape catalyst, in spite of the somewhat smaller specific surface area, a higher specific activity results in an overall activity that is incomparable to that of the irregular catalyst; the pore surface distribution is shifted to larger pores. The reaction rate constant decreases with increasing total pressure. The ball-shaped catalyst follows the relation kT.e ~ exp (j~o), while the irregular catalyst is fits the Nielsen equation, kT.p ~pi, where i andj are small negative numbers. The intrinsic reduction kinetics of the ball-shape catalyst are best in line with the contracting sphere model, and reduction of industrial size catalysts also shows that cobalt promotes the reduction of the catalyst. On the other hand, the uneven distribution of Co2+ ions in the irregular catalyst causes its intrinsic reduction kinetics to deviate from the contracting sphere model. We consider that the easier reduction of the cobalt containing catalyst may be caused by the much easier reduction of the CoFe204 present.

Wang et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 122 (1995) 5-20 the catalytic activity of iron-cobalt alloy catalysts containing 3 % alumina, prepared by co-precipitation, was maximal at a composition of 95% iron and 5% cobalt and that the reduction temperature can influence on the catalytic activity. Furthermore, this result was observed by Peev et al. [7] for a Co-promoted K20-A1203-iron catalyst prepared in by the same way. Since the iron catalyst for ammonia synthesis is structure sensitive [ 8], many factors influence its activity. Kalistratova et al. [9] pointed out that a fused iron catalyst containing cobalt with less wtistite (FeO) could be more active. Tricker [ 10] studied a series of Fe-Co ammonia synthesis catalysts prepared by conventional coprecipitation techniques followed by calcin- ing, reduction and stabilization steps. The reduced and stabilized samples consist of a Fe-Co alloy core, encased in an oxide shell, in which the Co/Fe ratio exceeds the Co/Fe ratio of the alloy core. It is likely that the Fe-Co distribution in the alloy core is inhomogeneous. In this paper we report a study of the activity, reaction kinetics and reduction behavior of various fused iron catalysts. We relate these parameters to the effect of varying the wtistite and cobalt content on catalyst structure and to the method employed for cooling the fused mass during catalyst preparation. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst sample preparation Catalyst samples with the same composition except for the cobalt content were prepared from a mixture of purified magnetite, alumina, potassium nitrate, calcium carbonate and cobalt oxide. It was melted in an electric resistance furnace at about 1800 K, the atomic iron ratio (i.e. Fe2+/Fe3+) was controlled by addition of metallic iron. When the iron ratio reached a definite value, the fused mass was poured out and was allowed to cool in air. Then, by crushing and screening out, the irregular catalyst was obtained. If the fused mass was dispersed and suddenly quenched in water, a ball-shape catalyst was formed [ 11,12 ]. The CoFe204 sample was prepared by sintering AnalaR grade Fe203 and CoO in stoichiometry at 1500- 1700 K, and then cooling slowly in the furnace. 2.2. MOssbauer effect spectroscopy The catalyst sample was ground and sieved through 200 mesh. The fine powder obtained was mixed with starch and pressed into a slice of 20 mm in diameter and a density of 8 mg/cm2 of natural iron. M6ssbauer spectra were taken using an AME-50 M6ssbauer spectrometer with a 57Co source in palladium at room tem- perature. An a-Fe foil of 25/.~m thickness was used as a standard to calibrate the velocity scale of the spectrometer. Data evaluation resulted in a Lorentzian form W.-X.

All curves were fitted by a least-squares method and the error for x per channel was 1.5-2.0 units. 2.3. X-ray diffraction The measurements were made with D/max-3B diffractometer using Cu Ka radiation with the exception of Fig. 2b, which was measured using Cr Kc~ radiation. The values of d and I were measured by the ladder scanning technique with a scan speed of 0.002/min from 20= 40to 45with o~-A1203 as internal standard. 2.4. Catalytic activity measurement All the activity tests were carried out in a tubular flow fixed-bed reactor operating under high pressure. 4 ml of catalyst sample of size 1.00-1.25 mm was used for each run. It was reduced in situ by a purified nitrogen-hydrogen mixture, according to a program described in Table 1. The reduction was continued at 773 K, until the ammonia concentration at the reactor exit became constant. Then the activity was measured at a specified temperature (698 K), pressure ( 15 MPa) and space velocity of N2-H2 (1:3) gas (as 30 000 h-~). The gas mixture exiting the reactor was passed through a gas absorption apparatus in which the synthesized ammonia was completely absorbed in boric acid solution. It was then titrated with 0.05 M n2so4 using a mixture of methyl red and methylene blue as indicator, to determine the ammonia concentration (mol.-%). In the reaction kinetics study, The rate constant of the reaction was evaluated using the Temkin-Pyzhev equation [ 13 ]. 2.5. Thermal gravimetry (TG) experiment The reduction behavior of the catalyst sample was studied with a Rigaku thermal analyzer (TG-DTG). Catalyst samples ( < 300 mesh and weighing about 30 mg) 8 W.-X. Wang et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 122 (1995) 5-20 were reduced in purified hydrogen (flow-rate 120 ml/min) using a programmed rise in temperature of 5 K/min from room temperature to 873 K. The Coats- Redfern method [14] was used to determine the kinetic parameters of reduction. The industrial size catalysts (5-6 mm) were reduced using a ladder temperature rise. 2.6. Pore size distribution measurement Catalyst samples ( 1-1.25 mm) were reduced in a temperature program identical to that of the catalytic activity measurement. At the end of the reduction process the sample was passivated at room temperature with nitrogen containing ca. 0.1% oxygen. The oxygen concentration was gradually increased, so that the catalyst temperature did not exceed 60 (333 K), until the catalyst could not be further oxidized when contacted with air. The oxygen content of the passivated catalyst was determined to be about 5 wt.-% by TG. The measurements of the pore size distribution were done by mercury intrusion on Micromeritics Auto-pore 9200 V2.03 from pore radius 40 to 0.002/xm. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Structure and activity M6ssbauer effect spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction The catalyst precursor Fe304 has a close-packed inverse spinel structure. The distribution of Fe2+ and Fe3+ over A site (tetrahedral) and B site (octahedral) positions can be expressed as follows: [Fe3 + ] A [Fez +- Fe3 + ] BO4. The M6ssbauer spectra of unreduced catalysts shown in Fig. 1 are easily interpreted as being due to two six-line hyperfine patterns corresponding to iron ions in B sites and A sites, respectively. The M6ssbauer parameters of the catalyst samples are listed in Table 2. As can be seen from Table 2, there is a different ionic cobalt distribution in the irregular and ball-shape catalysts due to their different thermal history. For the irregular cobalt- containing catalysts with the same iron ratio (Fe2 Fe3 = 0.60), the ratio of the peak area of B sites to A sites A1B/A1A is much lower than 2 and a broadening of the 1A line ( F1 A) is observed. This indicates that cobalt ions enter the structure of the Fe304 precursor. The area ratio of AFeO/Atotal increases with increase of cobalt content, further indicating that Co2 + ions replace the Fe2 of the B sites. This result is easily comprehended bearing in mind that Co2 ions have a large octahedral site preference energy (OSPE) and that the cooling was slower in the course of catalyst preparation. For the ball-shape catalysts, there is no significant variation in AFeO/Atotal and A l B/A 1 A, while the linewidths of the 1A line and 1B line are simultaneously widened. This should be attributed to an even distribu- tion of cobalt ions in the catalysts produced using the water quench technique. W.-X.

The above results are also supported by X-ray diffractionTable 3 shows that with increasing cobalt content, the increased relative intensities (/FeO) are consis- tent with the variation of the AFeO/Atotal values observed in M6ssbauer effect spectroscopy of the irregularly shaped catalysts; and the decreased d(,~) values of the 400 reflections with an internal standard present show that the lattice constant of the substituted Fe304 is shrunk as a result of the substitution of Co2 cations for the Fe2 cations of the B sites, similarly to the results of CoxFe3-xO4 reported by Rajaram [ 15]. Although Kalistratova et al. [9] reported that more CoO existed in Wtistite, we did not observe any variation in d(A) FeO values of the irregular cobalt-containing catalystsAn increased d(A) value of the ball-shape catalyst with addition of cobalt suggests that Co2 + ions enter the A site and B site (cf. the Goldschmidt ionic radius: rCo20.82 A, rFe20.83 ,~ in the B site; FCo2=07 ,~, rFe3+ =03 ,~ in the A site) 10 W.-X.

M6ssbauer effect spectroscopy (Fig. 3) shows its hyperfine internal magnetic fields as follows: HA=502, HBI =513, HB2=509, HB3=501 and HB4=479 (KOe); the ratio of peak area A 1B/A 1A = 1.45, and the degree of inversion = 0.82. Its formula can therefore be written as: 2+ 3+ 3+ 2+ (C00.18Fe0.82) A(Fel.18Coo.82) BOa The peak overlap in the XRD of Fe304 and CoFe204 made it difficult to prove the existence of CoFe204 in the catalyst. However, when we fully oxidized a higher cobalt content irregular catalyst with a lower iron ratio in which no trace CoO was detected by XRD, XRD peaks appeared of CoFe204 (Fig. 2b). We conclude that the B-site Co2 ions with their surrounding Fe3 cations constitute a stable structure element in CoFe204. This element can maintain the inverse spinel structure of the catalysts when the atomic iron ratio (Fe2 Fe3 ) decreases. If the iron ratio Fe2 / Fe3 + > 0.5, wtistite should be present, and more cobalt ions are likely to enter into Table 3 d (A,) of 400 reflection of F%O4-substituted, I and d (/k ) of 200 reflection of FeO in unreduced catalysts (/Fe30a- substituted = 100) Irregular catalyst Ball-shape catalyst mol Co/kg cat 0.000 0.3 l 1 0.622 0.000 0.311 Fe2 Fe3 + 0.60 0.60 0.60 0.56 0.55 dFe~O4-substituted ( A ) 2,0983 2.0974 2.0963 2.0963 2.0978 dFeO (A) 2,1486 2.1482 2.1483 2.1464 2.1471 /FeO 24 34 63 18 25 W.-X.

It is interesting that from M6ssbauer data (Table 2), we observe a large change of Q.S. values at lower iron ratio (Fe2 +/Fe3 + = 0.40). The quadrupole splitting depends on the electric field gradient at the nucleus. Conse- quently, changes in quadrupole splitting reflect changes in symmetry of the iron ions, and reflect therefore the dispersity of iron oxides. However Q.S. is a function of particle size of the iron oxides [ 16,17]. Therefore, such changes are possibly the main reason that the reduced irregular cobalt-containing catalyst at a lower iron ratio has a large specific pore surface (Table 4). Pore pattern and catalytic activity In Fig. 4, the pore surface distribution spectra of the typical reduced catalyst samples are shown. An analysis of specific surface area (SA) data (Table 4) shows that the pore patterns of the irregular and ball-shaped catalysts are quite different. The irregular cobalt-containing catalysts exhibit more micropore (r < 150 ,~) sur- faces, in agreement with the fact that the SA of reduced CoFe204 consists of such pores. Generally, the presence of cobalt increases the value of SA, but a SA decline appears for higher cobalt content. Meanwhile, a small SA value is observed at higher atomic iron ratio. This may be the result of two causes. First, a greater cobalt fraction is distributed in wtistite (FeO) as ref. [9] indicated. Second, the inverse spinel structure of the catalysts is destroyed by large numbers of Fez + ions. On the other hand, when Fez+/Fe3+ < 0.5, Fe203 is present, and when some Fez+ ions in B sites are replaced by Co2 +, then the reaction FeO + Fe203 ~ Fe304 may proceed, and a new inverse spinel Fe304 is formed. Furthermore, the smaller dispersed iron oxide particles, as detected by M6ssbauer spectra, result in a lower iron ratio. Comparing the irregular and ball-shape catalysts of the same composition, we found that the SA values of ball-shape catalysts are smaller and their pore W.-X.

This indicates that an even distribution of various promoters formed by the water quenching technique [ 18] can produce a relatively even reduced surface area distribution. However, it is worth noticing that an increased SA value of ball-shape catalysts is also caused by an increasing micro- pore surface. The influence of the iron ratio on SA values is different from that on irregular catalysts. The SA values seem to increase with increase of the atomic iron ratio. If it is considered that a definite inverse spinel structure of the substituted Fe304 is able to maintain a higher SA of the reduced catalysts, an even distribution of positive bivalent ions in precursor Fe304 must destroy such a structure at a lower iron ratio. If Fe2+/Fe3+ > 0.5, FeO is present when some Fe3+ in A sites are replaced by Co2 +, Fe203 + FeO --* Fe304, thus a new inverse spinel Fe304 can be formed. Therefore a higher SA is possible for ball-shape catalysts which have a higher iron ratio. A higher catalytic activity depends on a large SA of the catalysts. Comparison of Table 4 and Table 5 shows that the catalytic activity varies analogous to the SA variation, but it should be emphasized that cobalt can also increase the catalytic activity by raising the specific (area) activity by choosing a suitable cobalt content. From an investigation of the influence of iron ratio changes on the activities of the irregular cobalt-containing and cobalt-free catalysts, we can see that when the iron ratio reaches a certain value, the cobalt has little effect. As for ball-shape catalysts, the influence of the atomic iron ratio on activity is not so remarkable. From a comparison of SA values with that of an irregular catalyst with the same compo- sition, the ball-shape catalyst has, in spite of a small SA, a higher specific (area) activity. This makes its overall activity nearly constant. 14 W.-X.

Although different values for parameter a have been used by various authors, a value of a --- 0.5 for all iron catalysts is as a rule used by many chemists [ 20]. We used a = 0.5 for cobalt-free [21 ] and cobalt-containing [22] fused iron catalyst and obtained satisfactory results, especially for the ball- shaped catalyst. In this paper, not only the influence of temperature (T) but also of pressure (P) on the reaction rate constant is considered. By making a linear regression analysis, we found that the cobalt-containing irregular catalysts fit Nielsen's formula [ 13 ] k = ko exp( - E/RT)Pi= k'Pi ( 1 ) k' =ko exp(-E/RT) (2) k is the rate constant, calculated from the integrated equation of Temkin and pyzhev [ 13 ], k is a function of temperature and pressure, E is the activation energy, ko is the frequency factor and i is a small negative number. The parameter i reflects the influence of pressure on the rate constant k. For the ball-shape catalysts, a new relationship is required: kr.e = ko exp( - E / RT) exp(jp) = kor, p exp(jp) (3) kor.e = ko exp( - E/ RT) (4) kr.p is the rate constant, as is k in Nielsen' s formula, calculated from the integrated equation of Temkin and Pyzhev. E is the activation energy, ko is the frequency W.-X. Wang et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 122 (1995) 5-20 15 factor, j is a small negative number that, like i, reflects the influence of pressure on the rate constant k~.e, but in a different type of function eap. Evidently, formulae (2) and (4) are the Arrhenius equation, The kinetic para- meters can be found by computation from experimental data of ammonia synthesis. The result of a ball-shape cobalt-containing catalyst is illustrated in Fig. 5 and Table 6. On comparing Eq. ( 1 ) and Eq. (3), the rate constant of ball-shape catalysts will more rapidly decrease with increase of the total reaction pressure. We recall that the size of the catalyst samples in the activity experiment is in the range 1.0-1.25 ram. For the intrinsic kinetics studies, Nielsen [ 19] used catalyst particles in the size 0.3--0.7 mm, Bokhoven and Van Raayen [23] used 0.5-0.7 mm particles, while Guacci et al. [20] used 0.42-0.50 mm particles. However, the reaction rate of the ammonia synthesis will be somewhat retarded by the diffusion of gas inside the porous catalyst particles as the size is in the 1.0-1.25 mm range [24,25]. There are mainly two types of diffusion possible in small pores. The mean free path A and the pore diameter d are the determining factors. Whenever A > d, Knudsen diffusion occurs. When A < d, bulk diffusion occurs. The Knudsen diffusion con- stant Dk is proportional to the pore radius, but independent of total pressure; The bulk diffusion constant DB is inversely proportional to total pressure, but inde- pendent to pore radius. Wheeler [25] has computed the diffusion coefficients of hydrogen in a H2-N2 mixture through 50 A pores at 30 atmospheres pressure (ca. 3 MPa), 473 K. The results were: Dk= 7.4310-2 cm2/s; DB =5.8410 2 cm2/s. Since DB and DK are of about the same magnitude, the mean free path and pore diameter are of the same magnitude. Therefore the diffusion is in the transition range between Knudsen and bulk diffusion. It should be noted that a similar case is observed under our experimental conditions. Table 4 shows that the irregular catalyst contains much more pores of size ~< 50 X than the ball-shape catalyst. The influence of Knudsen diffusion in the former is larger than in the latter. At the same time, because the pore surface distribution of ball-shape catalysts is comparatively shifted to larger pores, the influence of bulk diffusion for the irregular catalysts is smaller than for the ball-shape catalysts. Of course the pressure influence on the 'rate constant' of the ball-shape catalysts is more significant than for the irregular one. Thus the 'rate constant' of ball-shape catalysts is likely to decrease more rapidly with increase of total pressure. Furthermore, it may be predicted that the ball-shape cobalt containing catalyst is to be preferred for application under rela- tively low pressures. 3.2. Reduction behavior From Table 7, The TG-DTG data obtained by repeated experiments for 300 mesh irregular and ball-shape catalyst samples with a temperature ramp of 5 K/ min show that the apparent starting reduction temperature (Ti) and the maximum reduction rate temperature (Tmax) decrease with increasing cobalt content in the 16 W.-X.

We consider that this can be caused by the much easier reduction of CoFe204 in the catalysts. By contrast with the irregular catalysts we do not observe any apparent changes of Ti and Tmax for the ball-shape catalysts. It is evident, however, that cobalt promotes the reduction of the ball-shape catalysts of industrial size (Fig. 6). As regards reduction kinetics studies, we used the Coats- Redfem method to make a regression analysis and found that the reaction order (n) of the ball-shape catalysts is 0.66, which is in agreement with the contracting sphere model [26]: dx/dt= k4~'[ ro( 1 -x) ~/3] 2 (5) x is the degree of reduction, t is the time of reduction, ro is the radius of a spherical particle and k is the rate constant. If the reduction follows this model, the reaction order will be 2/3 or 0.66 This result has been further testified by isothermal reduction (Fig. 7). This is just as we expected since the characteristics of the ball-shape catalyst satisfy the model assumptions. For the irregular catalysts, on the other hand, the uneven distribution of cobalt ions in the catalysts produces a deviation from the contracting sphere model (see Table 7, n=0.77), especially for catalysts of higher cobalt content.

Conclusion M6ssbauer effect spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction show a different cobalt distribution in irregular catalysts (prepared by natural cooling of the fused mass) and ball-shape catalysts (formed by water quenching). For the former the Co2+ ions replace mainly Fe2 + ions of the B sites of the inverse spinel structure of Fe304, because Co2+ ions posses a large octahedral site preference energy (OSPE). A relatively even distribution of cobalt over A sites and B sites is observed for the ball-shape catalysts. Within certain limits the activity and specific surface area of the cobalt -contain- ing irregular catalysts increase with increase of the cobalt content and decrease of the atomic iron ratio (Fe2 +/Fe3 + ). Meanwhile, the higher activity depends on a larger specific surface area of the catalyst. The easier reduction of cobalt-containing catalysts is due to the easier reduction of the COF0204 present. The activity of ball- shape catalysts will be remarkably improved by a proper content of cobalt. In contrast with the irregular catalyst, a distinctive influence of the atomic iron ratio on the specific surface area of ball-shape catalyst is observed. The different distri- butions of cobalt in the catalysts leads to different patterns of the pore size distri- bution. Thus, different effects of total pressure on the reaction rate constant of ammonia synthesis will result if a retardation of the internal diffusion occurs. The ball-shape catalyst containing cobalt is to be preferred when used at relatively low pressure. The reduction kinetics of ball-shape catalysts are best in line with the contracting sphere model; deviations occur for irregular catalysts, especially for higher cobalt content. References [ 1 ] A.
