Graphical abstract Se-NiS2 undergoes surface evolution at lower potentials and requires the lowest voltage for conversion to NiOOH, accompanied SO4 2- and SeO4 2- leaching, again adsorbed onto catalyst surface to enhance catalytic activity. Surface reconstruction of electrocatalysts has been widely witnessed during the electrochemical processes. Here, NiS2, NiSe2, and Se doped NiS2 (Se-NiS2) are fabricated for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) through a mild sulfuration and/or selenylation process of Ni(OH)2 supported on carbon cloth (CC). Through careful in-situ Raman spectroscopy and ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, surface reconstruction of NiS2, NiSe2, and Se-NiS2 during the OER process has been revealed. A potential-dependent study shows that Se-NiS2 undergoes surface evolution at lower potentials and requires the lowest potential for conversion to NiOOH as a highly OER-active species, accompanied by the leaching of SO4 2− and SeO4 2− that can again be adsorbed on the catalyst surface to enhance the catalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that Se-NiS2 is more susceptible to surface oxidation through the OER process. Therefore, Se-NiS2 exhibits outstanding OER activity and stability in alkaline conditions, requiring an overpotential of 343 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm−2. A novel insight is provided by our work in understanding the surface reconstruction and electrocatalytic mechanism of Ni-based chalcogenides. Keywords Oxygen evolution reaction Se-NiS2 In-situ Raman spectroscopy Anion leaching Surface reconstruction 1 Introduction In the face of the growing energy crisis, new energy conversion and storage via electrochemical reactions are essential for pluralistic and sustainable energy delivery system [1-6]. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an extremely critical semi-reaction as an anode reaction for water electrolysis [7], metal-air batteries [8], and nitrogen fixation [9]. However, the efficiency of OER is usually restrained by the four-electron transfer process, which is intrinsically slow. Generally, noble metal-based electrocatalysts (Ru-based and Ir-based) have outstanding OER performance, while relatively high price and low storage capacity restrict their practical applications [10,11]. Hence, the development of cost-effective and highly efficient non precious metal electrocatalysts is essential to accelerate clean energy conversion and storage technologies. Within the various electrocatalysts, (Fe, Co, Ni)-based catalysts, comprising metal oxides [7], carbides [12], phosphides [13], and chalcogenides [14,15], have been extensively explored owing to the low cost, controllable electronic structure, and excellent OER performance. Specifically, transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) with low electrical resistivity and metallic features are initially considered to be promising OER catalysts [8,10,14]. In fact, as one kind of precatalysts, surface layer of TMCs is usually transformed to (oxy)hydroxides during the course of OER process, which however outperform the pure (oxy)hydroxides in terms of catalytic activity [16-20]. For instance, it has been found that Cr-NiS2 as a precatalyst undergoes irreversible reconstitution to form NiOOH at the surface, which generates highly active sites for electrocatalytic water oxidation [21]. Meanwhile, anions will be leached out accompanying by the oxidation process, and researchers have investigated the effect of anions in catalyst reconstitution [22]. It is revealed that Ni3S2 precatalyst will be transformed into NiOOH/ Ni3S2 with S leaching, boosting the OER performance [23]. Moreover, following a detailed series of in situ spectroscopic researches and theoretical calculations, it has been revealed that the high catalytic performance of TMCs originated from adsorbed SO4 2− or SeO4 2− (from the oxidation of S or Se) on TM oxyhydroxides [24]. Above results display that surface reconstruction is common and possibly essential for improving the activity of OER catalysts. However, the relationship between electrocatalysts structure and surface reconstruction in the course of the OER process seems to be unclear so far. Furthermore, the mechanism of action of anions in the OER process is still not well interpreted. Therefore, deciphering the surface evolution involved in the OER reaction of TMCs electrocatalysts and elucidating the effect of anions in TMCs during OER process are utmost necessity in developing ultra-high efficiency OER catalysts. Here, we designed and fabricated three control samples of NiS2, NiSe2, and Se doped NiS2 (Se-NiS2) through a mild sulfuration and/or selenylation of Ni(OH)2 supported on carbon cloth (CC). In-situ Raman spectroscopy and ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies were applied to investigate surface reconstruction as well as anion leaching and adsorption on the OER performance. It was revealed that Se-NiS2 was able to undergo surface evolution at lower potentials and required the lowest voltage for conversion to NiOOH, accompanied by leaching of SO4 2− and SeO4 2−. The SO4 2− and SeO4 2− adsorbed onto the catalyst surface is important for improving the catalytic activity. As well as providing a new perception into understanding the structural evolution of TMCs, this work also paves a new avenue for dianionic modulation strategy of nickel-based chalcogenide catalysts to design highly efficient electrocatalysts for new energy conversion and storage applications. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of Ni(OH)2/CC precursor Commercial carbon cloth (CC) is cleaned several times using acid, ethanol and deionized water. Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (0.0015 mol), CO(NH2)2 (0.0075 mol), and NH4F (0.004 mol) were mixed by 25 mL of deionized (DI) water and stirred for 15 min. A piece of CC was placed in a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, which was retained to 120 °C for 6 h. 2.2 Synthesis of NiS2/CC NiS2/CC was prepared through sulfuration of Ni(OH)2/CC precursor. Ni(OH)2/CC and 1.0 g elemental sulfur were put in two quartz boats. The tube was then raised to 300 °C by the rate of 2 °C/min and held for 4 h. 2.3 Synthesis of NiSe2/CC NiSe2/CC was synthesized through similar conditions to NiS2/CC by replacing elemental sulfur with elemental selenium, and heating condition was changed to 450 °C by the rate of 5 °C min−1 and retained for 2 h. 2.4 Synthesis of Se-NiS2/CC with different Se doping amounts Se-NiS2/CC was synthesized under similar conditions to NiS2/CC, except that 1.0 g elemental sulfur was replaced by a mixture of selenium (1.0 g) and sulfur (1.0 g). Moreover, Se-NiS2/CC was synthesized with different mass feeding ratios using the same synthesis method. The feeding ratio of S: Se is 1:0.2, 1:0.5, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3, respectively. 2.5 Characterizations X-ray diffraction (XRD) was obtained by X’PERT focus X-ray diffractometer applying Cu K α radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out on the TESCAN VEGA3 LMH using an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) were obtained by AMR 200F using 300 kV accelerating voltage. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) datas were obtained with the PHI 5700 with Al K α X-rays by hυ = 1486.0 eV. We have taken the C 1s position under 284.6 eV for reference. Atomic force microscope (AFM) was obtained by the Bruker Dimension ICON system with ScanAsyst mode. 2.6 Electrochemical measurements The electrochemical measurements were performed with using a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation using a standard three-electrode system containing a graphite rod (Alfa Aesar, 99.9995%) serving as the counter electrode and Hg/HgO electrode (1 M KOH solution) as the reference electrode. The synthesized electrocatalysts were employed directly as the working electrodes. Before electrochemical measurement, the reference electrode was calibrated [25]. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was obtained by the scan rate of 50 mV s−1 for 50 cycles between 0.1 and 1.1 V for activating catalysts before the linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) test. LSV was employed using a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. If not otherwise labelled or stated, potentials in our work had been calculated with the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and corrected with iR compensation. Tafel slopes were obtained by fitting the linear part of the plots of overpotential versus log current density. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) had been performed at the applied potential with 0.75 V vs. Hg/HgO from 100,000 to 0.1 Hz by the amplitude of 0.005 V. 2.7 Potential-dependent in situ Raman spectroscopy All Raman measurements were carried out on the confocal-micro-Raman (Renishaw-inVia) using 532 nm laser excitation with adjusted potentials by an electrochemical workstation. The integration time is 30 s and the laser power is 1.25 mW. Working electrode was perpendicular to the laser. Using Pt tablet served as the counter electrode. An Hg/HgO electrode served as the reference electrode. To study surface reconstruction process, all samples would not be subjected to CV activation as for LSV measurement. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis and characterization The Ni(OH)2/CC precursor was obtained through a simple hydrothermal process, where homogeneous Ni(OH)2 nanosheets arrays were grown on the CC frameworks (Figs. S1–S3). The CC-supported NiS2, NiSe2, and Se-NiS2 were synthesized through a mild sulfuration and/or selenylation of Ni(OH)2/CC (Fig. 1 a). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to determine the structure and morphology of NiS2/CC, NiSe2/CC and Se-NiS2/CC. From the SEM (Fig. 1b and e) and low-magnification TEM images (Fig. 1c and f), it is clear that both NiS2 and Se-NiS2 preserve the regular nanosheets array morphology of the Ni(OH)2 precursor. The ultra-thin laminated structure creates an ideal pathway for the electrons transfer during OER reaction. The high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) images of NiS2 and Se-NiS2 in Fig. 1(d and g) indicate lattice fringes of 0.27 and 0.23 nm, corresponding to the (200) and (211) planes of NiS2, respectively. Exceptionally, NiSe2/CC presents honeycomb nanoplates (Fig. 1h and i), caused by the higher calcination temperature in preparation of NiSe2/CC. Upon close observation by HRTEM, the lattice fringes of 0.18 and 0.27 nm correspond well with the (311) and (210) planes of NiSe2 (Fig. 1j). Furthermore, the atomic force microscopy (AFM) indicates that the thickness of Se-NiS2, NiS2, and NiSe2 are ∼3, ∼10 and ∼15 nm, respectively (Fig. S4). All catalysts display nanosheets morphology, agreeing well with the TEM and SEM measurements. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-synthesized NiS2/CC, Se-NiS2/CC, and NiSe2/CC are depicted in Fig. 1(k). For NiS2/CC, the peak at about 25° belongs to CC, while the peaks at 27.6°, 32.0°, 35.9°, 39.4°, 45.9° and 54.4° could be indexed to the (111), (200), (210), (211), (220) and (311) planes of NiS2 (JCPDS PDF#04–0850). The XRD pattern of Se-NiS2/CC is very similar to that of NiS2/CC, except that the diffraction peaks are slightly shifted, resulting from the Se doping. As for NiSe2/CC, it exhibits major characteristic peaks at 29.9°, 33.5°, 36.8°, 42.8°, 50.7°, 55.5°, 57.8°, 72.6° and 84.3°, indexing to (200), (210) (211), (220), (311), (023), (321), (421) and (511) planes of NiSe2 (JCPDS PDF#41–1495). As shown in the Raman spectra of Fig. 1(i), NiS2 spectrum shows only three peaks: two relatively minor peaks at about 270 cm−1 and one peak at about 470 cm−1. According to the reference [26], the low-frequency doublet is attributed to the pair liberations [Tg(1) and Eg modes], and the high-frequency singlet belongs to in-phase stretching vibrations of the S-S pairs. For NiSe2, there are only two peaks at 217 and 246 cm−1, attributed to the Ag and Tg modes of Se-Se stretching. Particularly, three peaks at 265, 387 and 469 cm−1 can be assigned to Se-Se, Se-S and S-S pairs in Se-NiS2 spectrum. It is noteworthy that the peak positions of S-S and Se-Se are shifted slightly for Se-NiS2, which is another evidence of Se doping [27,28]. Additionally, scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and corresponding elemental mapping were used to determine the element distribution. The uniform distribution of Ni, S and a small amount of Se again confirms the successful doping of Se in NiS2. 3.2 Electrocatalytic performance for alkaline OER As-prepared Se-NiS2/CC, NiS2/CC, and NiSe2/CC were tested in 1 M KOH solution in a classical three-electrode system to obtain their electrocatalytic OER performances [25]. Considering that Se doping for catalysts has an impact on the OER performance, OER activity was tested for Se-NiS2/CC with different doping amounts of Se. The doping amount of Se was determined by ICP-OES and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) (Table S2 and Fig. S6). It should be noted that the doping amount of Se gradually increased with the increase of feeding ratio (Figs. S6 and S7). In all Se-NiS2/CC series, when the mass feeding of S:Se is 2:1, the catalyst displayed the best OER activity (Fig. S8). Subsequently, the polarization curves of Se-NiS2/CC, NiS2/CC, and NiSe2/CC electrodes were investigated in Fig. 2 (a). The overpotential of 343 mV is necessary for Se-NiS2/CC to achieve the current density of 50 mA cm−2. This overpotential is much lower than that of NiS2/CC (400 mV), NiSe2/CC (464 mV) and the commercial RuO2/CC (498 mV), which clearly indicates the effect of Se-doping to the improved OER activity. In addition, LSV curve with reverse scan of Se-NiS2/CC, NiS2/CC and NiSe2/CC were tested. The overpotential of Se-NiS2/CC, NiS2/CC and NiSe2/CC were 422, 473 and 598 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm−2, respectively (Fig. S9). Se-NiS2/CC still shows the best catalytic activity, which agrees with the above experimental results. Similarly, the Tafel slope (Fig. 2b) of Se-NiS2/CC (140 mV dec−1) is lower than those of NiS2/CC (186 mV dec−1), NiSe2/CC (281 mV dec−1), and the commercial RuO2/CC (325 mV dec−1), suggesting relatively faster OER kinetics for Se-NiS2/CC. Moreover, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) shows that the charge transfer resistance (R ct) of Se-NiS2/CC is still the lowest of all catalytic materials, demonstrating accelerated electron transport at the catalyst/electrolyte interface and faster reaction kinetics (Fig. 2c). To uncover the origin of OER activity, the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was derived from the double-layer capacitance (C dl) tests measured through a cyclic voltammetry (CV) test (Fig. S10). Notably, the Se-NiS2/CC owns a relative higher C dl value of 4.0 mF cm−2 among the catalysts, suggesting that more active sites are exposed during OER process (Fig. 2d). In addition, the ECSA of Se-NiS2/CC is determined to be 27.5 cm2, which is obtained from the equation ECSA = C dl/C s [29] Further normalization of the LSV curves was performed using ECSA to evaluate the intrinsic activity of the catalysts (Fig. 2e). Significantly, the normalized current density of Se-NiS2/CC is 0.2596 mA cm−2 under the overpotential of 375 mV, which is much higher than that of NiS2/CC (0.1070 mA cm−2) and NiSe2/CC (0.1771 mA cm−2), thus indicating that Se-NiS2/CC holds excellent intrinsic activity for OER. Meanwhile, mass activity is also a significant factor for measuring the inherent activity of catalysts. Therefore, the LSV curves have been normalized with the load masses to eliminate the influence of different loading masses of electrocatalysts. The mass activity of Se-NiS2/CC is 7.07 A g−1 with the overpotential of 375 mV, which is 3.0 and 7.4 times higher than NiS2/CC and NiSe2/CC, as shown in Fig. 2(f). Above results clearly demonstrate that Se-NiS2/CC exposes more active sites and owns higher intrinsic catalytic activity for the OER process, an indication that Se doping can effectively enhance the OER performance of NiS2, although NiSe2 has the poorest OER responses among these three samples. In addition, the constant current measurement and polarization curve after 2000 cycles demonstrate the excellent durability and stability of the Se-NiS2/CC, where the OER performance can still maintain 90.5% with continuous electrolysis with the current density of 100 mA cm−2 for 30 h (Fig. S11). Since the tendency of OER activity has already been discovered, we illustrated the potential relationship between the OER performance and the electrocatalyst structure in this part. Therefore, in situ Raman is employed to trace the surface structure evolution of catalysts in 1 M KOH solution under oxidation voltage (The samples were not subjected to CV activation as for LSV measurements). As shown in Fig. 3 (a), the first step was to explore the surface crystal structure of freshly synthesized Se-NiS2/CC under wet conditions at open circuit voltage. No clear peak appears at the region of 400–600 cm−1, implying the absence of Ni–O, Ni–OH or –OOH on the surface of the samples [30-32]. Interestingly, a new peak at 495 cm−1 appeared for the first time under the potential of 1.127 V, which is ascribed to the symmetric stretching vibration of Ni-O vibration of Ni(OH)2, suggesting that the surface reconstruction of catalyst has started [33,34]. More obvious transformation of surface evolution can be identified as the potential is raised to 1.367 V. The occurrence of notable Raman peaks at 474 and 554 cm−1, corresponding to the Eg Ni–O bending vibration mode and the A1g Ni–O stretching vibration, displays the generation of the γ-NiOOH phase [35]. The oxidation of Ni in Se-NiS2 is evidenced by two peaks of NiOOH which reinforce with increasing potential. Whereas in the region of 800–1100 cm−1, two new peaks at 980 and 1065 cm−1 arise at 1.227 to 1.447 V, which can be assigned to the S-O stretching of sulfate (SO4 2−). An additional new band occurred at 833 cm−1, with an increased potential ranging from 1.387 to 1.427 V, which is related to selenate (SeO4 2−) [24,36]. The clear signal of SO4 2− and SeO4 2− is still observed in a fresh KOH solution (Fig. S12), confirming that S and Se are oxidized to SO4 2− and SeO4 2− in Se-NiS2 under OER conditions. To investigate whether the Ni-O/NiOOH or anion transformation exists in other Ni-based materials, the OER processes of NiS2/CC and NiSe2 were as well as investigated by in situ Raman (Fig. 3b and c). The potential-dependent structure conversion was well identified for both NiS2 and NiSe2. Like Se-NiS2, NiS2 is first converted to Ni(OH)2 at low potentials and then evolves to NiOOH at higher potentials. Ni-O vibration appears at 1.227 V, indicating the beginning of surface evolution. Then the catalysts are converted to NiOOH as the potential increases to 1.387 V, accompanied by leaching of SO4 2−. It is worthy of mention that the vibration peak of Ni(OH)2 in NiSe2 is not the same as that of NiS2 and Se-NiS2, but NiOOH is directly generated at high potential of 1.387 V, accompanied by leaching of selenite (SeO3 2−) and SeO4 2−. Based on the OER activities, we reasonably conjecture that the formation of Ni-O bonds facilitates the OER process. On the basis of the above mentioned in situ Raman analyses, surface reconstruction evolution phenomena of as-prepared catalysts are supposed to be catalysts → Ni(OH)2 → NiOOH with elevated anodic potential, as well as SO4 2− and SeO4 2− leaching (Fig. 3d). Specifically, it is worth noting that surface evolution of Se-NiS2 occurs at lower potentials and requires the lowest voltage for conversion to NiOOH, demonstrating that Se-NiS2 is more easily oxidized than NiS2 and NiSe2. In addition, ex-situ XPS measurement was employed to explore the evolution of three electrocatalysts before and after the OER process. Peaks located at 853.78 and 871.28 eV can be attributed to nickel sulfide in the Ni 2p spectra of the Se-NiS2 (Fig. 4 a) [8]. Peaks at 855.88 and 873.98 eV are accounted for nickel oxide resulting from the inevitable surface oxidation [24]. After OER process, the peaks of nickel sulfide are gradually decreased and finally disappeared, and the peaks of nickel oxide become dominant, representing the oxidation of Ni in Se-NiS2 during OER. Furthermore, the Ni 2p spectrum of NiS2 (Fig. 4b) can also be divided into three pairs of peaks. The peaks located at 854.12 and 871.21 eV can be identified to nickel sulfide, and those at 856.43 and 874.12 eV are assigned to nickel oxide. After OER, the peaks of nickel sulfide are clearly depressed, and the peak intensity of nickel oxide gets higher, demonstrating Ni is oxidized during OER reaction. The same is true with NiSe2. The peaks located at 853.73 and 871.21 eV can be attributed to the nickel selenide, and to the nickel oxide at 855.78 and 873.92 eV (Fig. 4c). Similarly, the peak intensity of Ni–Se was decreased in NiSe2, while that of Ni-O was increased. Compared with NiS2, the oxidation degree of NiSe2 after OER is lower than that of NiS2. Besides, the S 2p spectra before and after the OER process of Se-NiS2 and NiS2 are compared in Fig. 4(d). Particularly, the peaks centered at 164.02 and 162.86 eV can be identified to the 2p 1/2 and 2p 3/2 peaks of S2 2−, where the peaks at 165.22 and 162.06 assigned to the 2p 1/2 and 2p 3/2 of S2−, respectively [7,37]. The peaks at 169.07 eV are clearly identified as S–O in SO4 2−. The presence of SO4 2− in the pristine materials could be caused by the unavoidable chemical oxidation. The peaks of S2 2− and S2− are remarkably weakened after the OER reaction, whereas S–O peak maintains its integrity in the high-resolution S 2p spectrum, illustrating the leaching and oxidation of S during electrochemical reaction. The dissolved S is intended to be present mainly in the form of SO4 2−. Similar to the S 2p, Se 3d spectra before and after the OER of Se-NiS2 and NiSe2 have similar variations. The Se 3d spectrum of NiSe2 and Se-NiS2 could be fitted into two peaks at 55.75 and 54.86 eV, respectively, assigned to the 3d 3/2 and 3d 5/2 of Se. The peak centered at 58.94 eV belongs to Se-O, which is caused by surface oxidation (Fig. 4e). After the OER process, not only the atomic percentage of Se in NiSe2 and Se-NiS2 decreases, but the Se–O peaks corresponding to oxidized state are also clearly increased, revealing the leaching and oxidation of Se as previously reported [34,24]. Furthermore, we calculated the ratios of nickel oxide/nickel sulfide after OER reaction for the three materials (Fig. 4f). The ratios of NiS2 and NiSe2 are 2.48 and 2.17, respectively. As for Se-NiS2, all the Ni-S on the surface was converted to Ni-O, which further confirmed the faster reaction rate of Se-NiS2, indicating that all the surface of Se-NiS2 was oxidized to NiOOH. The above results clearly reveal their surface oxidation degree after OER reaction: Se-NiS2 > NiS2 > NiSe2. After OER reaction, both S and Se were present in the form of S-O and Se-O, demonstrating the oxidative leaching of sulfur and selenium during the OER process. Notably, Se-NiS2 was oxidized to the highest extent, indicating its fast electrochemical reaction rate. The simultaneous leaching of SO4 2− and SeO4 2− effectively modulates the surface electronic structure of Se-NiS2, and thus it has the most excellent OER performance. Based on the results of in-situ Raman and ex-situ XPS, Se-NiS2, NiS2, and NiSe2 have all undergone surface reconstruction. To further explore the surface reconstruction phenomenon of three catalysts, XRD, SEM, and TEM tests were also investigated after a long stability test. Nanosheets morphology of catalysts is preserved well when the OER reaction is complete (Figs. S13–S16). Significantly, all three catalysts became looser as a result of alkaline corrosion, which is more conducive to promoting contact between the catalyst and the electrolyte. Besides, XRD patterns indicated the existence of only NiS2 after OER tests for NiS2/CC and Se-NiS2/CC (Fig. S17). For NiSe2/CC, the NiSe2 diffraction peaks became weak and NiO peaks have appeared, indicating that NiSe2 underwent surface reconstruction during the OER process. No diffraction peaks of NiOOH were found in the XRD patterns, possibly due to the amorphous nature. Besides, HRTEM images (Figs. S14–S16) demonstrate that an amorphous layer on the surface of the catalysts were displayed. Combined with Raman and XPS data (Figs. 3 and 4), the surface active species of the catalysts are amorphous NiOOH. It is worth noting that Se-NiS2/CC has the thickest amorphous layer (∼5 nm) compared with NiS2/CC (∼3 nm) and NiSe2/CC (∼1 nm), which fully proves that the surface reconstruction degree of Se-NiS2/CC is higher than that of NiS2/CC and NiSe2/CC. Although the leaching of anions is confirmed, it is still unclear the mechanism of anion action in the OER process. An inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) study demonstrates the element content in the material and electrolyte before and after OER process (Table S1). We can clearly note that the content of both sulfur and selenium in the catalyst after the reaction decreases, and sulfur and selenium can be detected in the electrolyte. This result indicates that sulfur and selenium are leached into the electrolyte during the OER process and subsequently adsorbed on the surface of the electrode material. Furthermore, Raman spectra of catalysts (after OER) and electrolyte also confirm the above results (Fig. S12). For NiS2 after OER process, two peaks located at 474 and 554 cm−1 are identified as NiOOH, reflecting the oxidation of Ni. The same results can be observed in NiSe2 and Se-NiS2. Moreover, the Raman bands at 980 and 1064 cm−1 ascribed to SO4 2−, get appeared both in NiS2 electrode and electrolyte. We can also obviously detect that Se-NiS2 has vibrational peaks of SO4 2−. This result reveals that the oxidation of the electrode produces SO4 2− that will come into the electrolyte and then be adsorbed on the electrode surface. It is notable that the SeO3 2− is discovered in the electrolyte, which is further oxidized to SeO4 2− when adsorbed to the electrode surface. This result fully demonstrates that the anion in the material is leached first and then adsorbed to the surface of reconstructed catalysts. Considering that the anions are first stripped out into the electrolyte and then adsorbed on the electrode surface during the OER process, the next question is whether adding the corresponding anions directly to the electrolyte will have an effect on the OER performance. As shown in Figs. S18–S20, the OER activity of Ni(OH)2/CC is further tested under 1 M KOH with 0.1 M SO4 2−, 0.1 M SeO3 2− and 0.1 M SO4 2−+0.1 M SeO3 2−, respectively. It implies that the external addition of anions has almost no effect on the OER properties of Ni(OH)2. Although the addition of SeO3 2− and SO4 2− ions can lower the overpotential of Ni(OH)2, the Tafel slope and the charge transfer resistance are both increased, indicating slower OER kinetics. Possibly, the addition of anions makes the solution’s viscosity unfavorable for charge transfer [38]. Furthermore, the OER activity of the reconstructed electrode in fresh electrolyte and the electrochemical performance of the comparison sample NiOOH were measured. The LSV curves of Se-NiS2/CC, NiS2/CC, NiSe2/CC for fresh electrolytes before and after rinsing with deionized water were compared (Fig. S21). It can be noted that LSV curves of NiS2/CC and NiSe2/CC barely changed, while the overpotential of Se-NiS2/CC increased by 20 mV when tested in the fresh electrolyte. This could be due to the presence of SO4 2− and SeO4 2− stabilising the electronic structure of the catalyst. These results are also corresponding to the test results of our added acid roots. Moreover, the NiOOH/CC was synthesized by electrodeposition and electrooxidation. Raman spectra have demonstrated the successful synthesis of NiOOH/CC (Fig. S22). The LSV curves and ECSA normalized LSV curves for NiOOH/CC and Se-NiS2/CC were tested (Fig. S22). It demonstrated that Se-NiS2/CC had better OER activity, and its intrinsic activity was better than NiOOH/CC. Therefore, the anion leaching and then adsorbed onto the reconstructed surface of the material is important for boosting the catalytic performance, resulting from the disordered, porous, high-surface-area skeleton-catalysts that possess numerous activity-rich sites and can be electrolyte-penetrable and bulk active [36]. Based on the experimental results, DFT calculations were further conducted to gain a detailed overview of the OER catalytic mechanism. The most stable surface, the (001) surface of NiOOH, was used for the relative calculations. In ordes to explore the impact of Se doping, models of NiS2 and Se-NiS2 based on NiOOH (001) were constructed. The simulated structures of NiOOH/NiS2 and NiOOH/Se-NiS2 are presented in Fig. 5 (a and b). Generally, the OER process takes place proceeds by a four-proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism as H2O→*OH→*O→*OOH → O2 [39]. The Gibbs free energies of the four elementary steps on NiOOH/NiS2 and NiOOH/Se-NiS2 were calculated. As shown in Fig. 5(c and d), the formation of *OOH intermediate is the rate-determining step (RDS) for all the models due to the high energy barrier. Clearly, the adsorption energy of *OOH intermediate on the Se-NiS2/NiOOH is much lower than that on the NiS2/NiOOH, indicating that the OER activity of NiS2 can be enhanced by doping of Se. To further clarify the impacts of the internal electronic properties of electrocatalysts with regard to the OER activity, the projected density of states (PDOS) and crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) of NiOOH/NiS2 and NiOOH/Se-NiS2 were determined. Fig. 5(e) displays the PDOS values of active Ni for NiOOH/NiS2 and NiOOH/Se-NiS2 together with the position of the appropriate d-band center. The Ni-element spin of Se-NiS2/NiOOH is centered downward (−1.372 eV), which is 0.033 eV higher than that of NiS2/NiOOH (−1.405 eV), indicating a stronger adsorption of NiOOH to OER intermediates in Se-NiS2/NiOOH. COHP analysis was performed for Ni–S bond and Ni–Se bond in the two models to compare the composition of bonding orbitals and anti-bonding orbitals. Obviously, the anti-bonding orbitals of Ni–Se bond crossed the Fermi energy level. It is proved that the anti-bonding orbital of the Ni-Se bond is partially filled and the Ni–Se bond is less stable than the Ni–S bond, indicating that Se-NiS2 is more easily oxidized and rapidly converted to NiOOH. This explains why Se-NiS2 exhibits better OER activity than NiS2. Charge density differences analysis and one-dimensional charge density difference between NiOOH and NiS2 (or Se-NiS2) analysis were shown in Fig. 5(g–i). In both optimized models, the NiOOH layer gains electrons. In order to more intuitively compare the degree of electron transfer between the two models, a planar average differential charge density plot was made to quantitatively analyze and compare the electron transfer situation. Notably, Se-NiS2 transfers more electrons to the NiOOH layer and is more likely to lose electrons. Hence, the calculations illustrate that Se-NiS2 is more susceptible to surface oxidation by the OER process, which is favorable to the production of NiOOH. Comparatively, the Ni–S bond in NiS2 is too strong for the production of NiOOH, while the Ni–Se bond is too weak and Se is extremely soluble, leading to its structural instability. 4 Conclusions In conclusion, we have successfully designed and fabricated three control samples of Se-NiS2, NiS2, and NiSe2 through a mild sulfuration and/or selenylation of Ni(OH)2 supported on carbon cloth for OER applications. Through various elaborative ex-situ and in-situ characterizations, the surface reconstruction of NiS2, NiSe2 and Se-NiS2 during the OER process has been demonstrated. It is revealed that Se-NiS2 is able to undergo surface evolution at lower potentials and required the lowest voltage for conversion to NiOOH, accompanied by the leaching of SO4 2− and SeO4 2−. Furthermore, the leached SO4 2− and SeO4 2− can again be adsorbed on the catalyst surface to improve the catalytic activity. Comparatively, the Ni-S bond in NiS2 is too strong for the production of NiOOH, while the Ni–Se bond is too weak and Se is extremely soluble, leading to its structural instability. As a result, Se-NiS2 displays superior OER activity in alkaline conditions, requiring an overpotential of 343 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm−2. We believe this work brings a new perspective in understanding the structure evolution and electrocatalytic mechanism of Ni-based chalcogenides.

        "dc:description": "Surface reconstruction of electrocatalysts has been widely witnessed during the electrochemical processes. Here, NiS2, NiSe2, and Se doped NiS2 (Se-NiS2) are fabricated for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) through a mild sulfuration and/or selenylation process of Ni(OH)2 supported on carbon cloth (CC). Through careful in-situ Raman spectroscopy and ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, surface reconstruction of NiS2, NiSe2, and Se-NiS2 during the OER process has been revealed. A potential-dependent study shows that Se-NiS2 undergoes surface evolution at lower potentials and requires the lowest potential for conversion to NiOOH as a highly OER-active species, accompanied by the leaching of SO4 2− and SeO4 2− that can again be adsorbed on the catalyst surface to enhance the catalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that Se-NiS2 is more susceptible to surface oxidation through the OER process. Therefore, Se-NiS2 exhibits outstanding OER activity and stability in alkaline conditions, requiring an overpotential of 343 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm−2. A novel insight is provided by our work in understanding the surface reconstruction and electrocatalytic mechanism of Ni-based chalcogenides.",
