Apartado. 99, E-03080 Alicante, Span (Received October 1, 1993; accepted January 11, 1994) Abstract Iron and molybdenum mono- and bimetallic catalysts supported on activated carbon have been prepared using iron pentacarbonyl and molybdenum hexacarbonyl as metal precursors. They have been characterizedby temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and carbon monoxide chemisorption at 195 K and 298 K, and their catalytic activity for carbon monoxide hydrogenation at atmospheric pressure was studied under differential conditions, after reduction in hydrogen at several temperatures. Carbon monoxide chemisorption on the monometallic molybdenum catalyst was found to be strongly temperature dependent. On the other hand, the irreversible carbon monoxide chemisorption was largely decreased in the bimetallic catalyst in relation to the monometallic iron sample. The effect of molybdenum on the catalytic activity of FeMo/C is very important, producing an increase in catalytic activity which is very dependent on the reduction temperature. The selectivity of the monometallic iron catalyst is strongly modified by molybdenum addition, which produces a great increase in the yield to methane and a decrease in the alkenes to alkanes (C:+C;) ratio.

Introduction The hydrogenation of carbon monoxide has received considerable attention over the past decades due to its importance as a source of hydrocarbons and oxygenates. Preferred catalysts consist in groups 8, 9 and 10 transition metals supported on alumina, silica or carbon. Among them, iron catalysts have been extensively studied mainly due to their ability to produce short chain alkenes with a relatively high selectivity at atmospheric pressure, specially when iron carbonyls are used as metal precursors. *Corresponding author; fax.

Rodnguez-Reinoso /Journal of Molecular Cataly sty 90 (/994) 291-301 Iron catalysts have been prepared by supporting iron carbonyls on titania [ 1], zeolites [2], silica [3], alumina [4], etc. More recently, carbon has been used to support iron carbonyls (i.e., Fe(CO)5 and Fe;(CO),_) [5-10], resulting in catalysts with a very high iron dispersion and large alkene to alkane ratio. Furthermore, stoichiometric mixed-metal Fe-Mn and alkali metal-Fe-Mn carbonyls [ 11-15] have been supported on activated carbon; in this way, the promoting effect of Mn and of the alkali metals was improved, possibly due to the intimate metal contact and to the low activation temperature needed to decompose the metal complexes to obtain zero-valent metals, given the inertness of the carbon surface. Molybdenum-based catalysts have been claimed for the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis of light hydrocarbons and alcohols [ 16-23]. Saito et al. studied the activity of several unsupported molybdenum compounds for CO methanation, comparing their catalytic properties with those of nickel and iron [ 16] . They found that molybdenum compounds were as active with lHz+ 1C0 as with 3Hz+ 1C0 feeds showing, at the same time, higher activities for the water-gas shift reaction than nickel and iron. Bridgewater et al, prepared charcoalsupported molybdenum catalysts and determined their properties at several temperatures and pressures after various activation treatments [ 17]. Later on, Dun et al. obtained high dispersion and high activity charcoal-supported molybdenum catalysts using incipient wetness and equilibrium adsorption methods, with ammonium heptamolybdate or molybdenum nitrate as metal precursors [20]. The effect of the support was studied by Tatsumi et al. [22] by comparing the activity and alkene selectivity of molybdenum catalysts prepared with ammonium heptamolybdate, molybdophosphoric acid and molybdenum hexacarbonyl supported on activated carbon, carbon black, molecular sieve carbon, silica gel, titania, magnesia and alumina. Among other features, they observed that activated carbon-supported catalysts showed high activity and selectivity for methane, while carbon black-supported catalysts exhibited high activity and selectivity for G_+ hydrocarbons. Later on, they reported the synthesis of light alcohols with molybdenum supported on MgO, Si02, Al and TiO, carrying out the reaction at 1.6 MPa [23]. The role of molybdenum as promoter of more active metals in CO hydrogenation has been studied on several systems. At atmospheric pressure it has been reported [24] that addition of Mo greatly increases the rate of C-O bond dissociation of adsorbed CO in methanation on Ru/AhO3. When the reaction is carried out at higher pressures, molybdenum not only enhances the CO hydrogenation rate, but also increases the methanol formation rate [25-27]. Also, the promoter effect of molybdenum on unsupported iron catalysts for carbon dioxide hydrogenation has been determined [28], observing that molybdenum addition decreases the alkene selectivity. Jackson et al. [29] used M00; as support for a number of metals (Fe, Ni, Ru, Rh and Pd) and determined their catalytic behaviour for the medium pressure hydrogenation of CO. All metals tested, except iron, showed enhanced activity in relation to the same metals supported on silica. They concluded that a fast spillover/reverse spillover of hydrogen between metal and support, which iron was not able to facilitate, was the factor responsible for the increased activity. This work was carried out with the aim of determining a possible promotional effect of molybdenum on iron for the hydrogenation of CO at atmospheric pressure, when both of them are well dispersed on an inert support with high surface area. In this way, we compare A. Sepulveda-Escribano. F. Rodriguez-ReinosolJournal of Molecular Catalysts 90 (1994) 291-301 293 the catalytic behaviour of a bimetallic carbon-supported iron-molybdenum catalyst in the title reaction to that of their corresponding monometallic counterparts. 2. Experimental The support was an activated carbon prepared from almond shells by carbonization in NZ (1123 K, 2 h) followed by activation to COZ (1098 K, 62% burn-off). The ash content, determined by burning away the carbon in air at 973 K for 5 h, was 0.1 wt.%. The carbon had a BET surface area of 1700 m-.g-' and was essentially microporous, but with a relatively well developed mesoporosity. A more detailed description of the textural properties of the support (named C-62) has been previously reported [ 10]. Catalysts were prepared by using molybdenum hexacarbonyl (Mo(CO)6) and iron pentacarbonyl (Fe(CO)5), both from Merck, as metal precursors. The support was previously evacuated at 523 K for 12 h under dynamic vacuum. Then, a solution of the corresponding precursor (or both of them in the case of the bimetallic sample) in n-pentane (10 cm 3 solution per gram of carbon) was added at room temperature in a nitrogen atmosphere and in absence of light, and the adsorption process was left to continue for 24 h. The excess of solvent was then eliminated by flowing nitrogen through the system; the dried catalysts, after exposure to air, were kept in a dry atmosphere until their use. Metal content was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy, after leaching the used catalysts with concentrated HCI, burning away the carbon support in air (1023 K, 6 h) and dissolving the resulting ashes in hot, concentrated HCI. Table 1 shows the catalysts prepared for this study. Temperature programmed reduction experiments were carried out with fresh samples. The catalyst (0.3 g) was placed in a quartz tube and dried in a He flow of 100 cm; - min-' at 473 K for 1 h, at a heating rate of 10 K - min. After cooling down to 403 K, the helium flow was changed by a 5%H=/He flow of 50 cm' - min-' and the temperature was raised at 3 K - min-'. The H. concentration in the effluent gases was determined by gas chromatography, with a thermal conductivity detector. Catalysts were also characterized by CO chemisorption at 195 K and 298 K. After reduction (50 cm3 - min-' H, flow, 623 or 673 K, 12 h), catalysts were evacuated for 1 h at 10-5 Torr (1 Torr= 133.3 Pa) at the reduction temperature, in order to eliminate the chemisorbed hydrogen. Finally, samples were cooled in vacuum to the chemisorption temperature. The amount of CO adsorbed was determined using the dual isotherm method of Yates and Sinfelt [30]. Five points in the 50 to 250 Torr range were obtained for the Table 1 Description of catalysts Catalyst Fe (wt.%) Mo (wt.%) Mo/Fe Fe/C 3 8 - 0.00 Mo/C - 10 - FeMo/C 3 2 0.9 0.16 294 A Sepulveda-Escrtbano.F.Rodriguez-Reino.solJournalojhfolecularCatalysis90(1994)2 91-301 determination of the adsorption isotherms. After completing the first isotherm, the weakly adsorbed CO was eliminated by evacuating the sample for 0.5 h at 10-5 Torr and then, the second isotherm was determined. The difference between both isotherms at 200 Torr was taken as the amount of CO irreversibly chemisorbed. The catalytic behaviour of the samples for carbon monoxide hydrogenation was studied at 0.1 MPa in a small, glass, plug-off reactor under differential conditions, keeping the conversion values below 10%. All samples were reduced \"in situ\" for 12 h, at several temperatures, in a 50 cm; . min- ' hydrogen flow before cooling in hydrogen to the reaction temperature. Then, a 50 cm3 - min- ' flow of H,/CO (3:1 ratio) was passed through the catalyst and, after 0.5 h reaction, products were periodically analyzed using a HewlettPackard gas chromatograph fitted with a flame ionization detector to determine hydrocarbons and a thermal conductivity detector to determine CO, and unreacted CO. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Temperature programmed reductiotr TPR profiles for the fresh Fe/C, Mo/C and FeMo/C catalysts are shown in Fig. 1. The reduction profile obtained with the monometallic iron catalyst is characterized by one sharp peak at about 600 K and a broader one between 750 K and 900 K, which can be assigned to a two step reduction of FeA. This result indicates that the carbon-supported iron carbonyl is decomposed upon exposure to air to yield metallic iron, which is readily oxidized to Fe203. A similar conclusion can be drawn from the TPR profile of the monometallic Mo/ C catalyst. In this case, the hydrogen consumption can be determined from about 673 K, yielding a maximum at 820 K, which would correspond to the reduction of MoOX species formed by oxidation of Mo in the carbonyl precursor by reaction with oxygen in the air. Two more maxima are observed at higher temperatures, which could indicate a multiple step reduction of the molybdenum oxide. The TPR profile corresponding to the bimetallic FeMo/C catalyst shows an interaction Hydrogen consumption (a.u.) 12 6 2~, o - 400 500 600 700 800 9001000 1100 Temperature (K) Fig. I.

Rodriguez-Reinoso /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 90 (1994) 291-301 295 between iron and molybdenum oxides which affects their reducibility. Thus, although two maxima in hydrogen consumption are observed at the same temperatures than for the monometallic counterparts (600 K for Fe/C and 820 K for Mo/C), a third one appears at 740 K. This peak can be assigned to the reduction of MoOx species that are in close contact with iron, which facilitates its reduction probably due to spillover of hydrogen from metallic iron atoms to the adjoining molybdenum oxide particles. On the other hand, the reduction of iron oxide is characterized in this bimetallic catalyst by a broad band, in contrast with the reduction profile of Fe/C, which shows a narrower peak at that temperature. This indicates a heterogeneity of iron species in the bimetallic catalyst, which is probably caused by the interaction of some of them with molybdenum oxide. Small amounts of methane are evolved during the TPR runs of both monometallic Fe/C and bimetallic FeMo/C catalysts, at temperatures higher than 900 K. This methane is produced by gasification of the support with hydrogen, reaction which is catalyzed by iron. 3.2. Co chemisorption Chemisorption of oxygen at low temperature (77 K or 195 K) is the commonly applied method to determine the surface area of molybdenum based catalysts [ 31 ] . However, in the case of activated carbon-supported catalysts, the high porosity of the support and its affinity for oxygen may cause some problems in the characterization of the catalysts with this gas. For this reason, CO chemisorption at 195 K and 298 K has been used in this study, bearing in mind the limitations of the method, as described below. The results obtained are reported in Table 2. CO chemisorption is strongly temperature dependent on the monometallic Mo/C catalyst reduced at 623 K, as can be deduced from results in Table 2, where the CO/Mo, ratios (amount of CO irreversibly chemisorbed/total amount of molybdenum in the catalyst) obtained at 195 K, 250 K and 298 K are presented. It can be seen that the amount of irreversibly chemisorbed CO decreases sharply when temperature increases, in such a way that it is nearly nil for 298 K.

Rodriguez-ReuiosolJournal ofMolecularCatalvsis 90(1994) 291-301 This temperature dependent chemisorption behaviour of molybdenum catalysts has been described previously in the literature for other systems in which molybdenum had different oxidation states [ 32,33 ] , but no convincing explanation has been given. This makes the determination of the molybdenum dispersion by means of CO chemisorption very difficult. However, the method may be useful when the aim is, as in this work, to study a bimetallic FeMo/C catalyst and to compare it with its monometallic counterparts. Moreover, the almost total lack of chemisorption capability of molybdenum at room temperature may be useful in the characterization of bimetallic catalysts since in such a case the technique will measure only surface iron atoms. For the monometallic iron catalyst, the results in Table 2 show that the COtyS/Fe, ratio is slightly lower than the C0,9R/Fe, ratio (COT: the amount of carbon monoxide irreversibly chemisorbed at a temperature T (K); Fe,: total amount of iron in the catalyst). This result could be explained in terms of a different CO/Fe, stoichiometry (Fe,: amount of surface iron atoms) at each temperature, ranging from 1CO:1Fe, (linear-type chemisorption) to lC0:2Fe, (bridge-typechemisorption) [34]. In view of the very small chemisorption capability of molybdenum at 298 K, it is possible to assign the amount of irreversibly chemisorbed CO at that temperature on the bimetallic catalyst to only surface iron. Thus, a very important decrease in the CO/Fe, ratio can be observed in the bimetallic catalyst in relation to the monometallic Fe/C. In a recent study on the effect of chromium addition on the behaviour of Fe/C catalysts [ 35 ] it was observed that the CO chemisorption capability of the catalysts was decreased when the Cr/Fe ratio increased, probably due to the competition between iron and chromium phases for the surface sites. A similar type of behaviour was found in molybdenum-promoted silicasupported rhodium catalysts [ 25 ] , and it was related to the coverage of noble metal particles by patches of molybdenum oxide, similarly to that described for systems showing strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) [ 36] ; the authors also found that the presence of molybdenum restricted iron reducibility. From the data in Table 2 it can be deduced that an increase of 50 K in the reduction temperature for the bimetallic catalyst practically does not modify the CO/Fe, ratio (0.44 vs. 0.39), this indicates that the amount of superficial reduced iron has not been increased by this increase in the reduction temperature. 3.3. Activil), and selectivit)Fig. 2 includes initial activities (after 0.5 h reaction) at 523 K of bimetallic FeMo/C (Amol-CO - s - ` - g-Fe ') and monometallic iron (ltmol-CO - s - ` . g-Fe -') and molybdenum (Amol-CO - s -' g-Mo-') after reduction at several temperatures, based on the total amount of CO converted. The monometallic molybdenum catalyst loses some activity when the reduction temperature is increased from 623 K to 723 K although, in any case, it shows a much lower activity than that of Fe/C and FeMo/C. The activity of supported molybdenum catalysts in CO hydrogenation depends on both the metal precursors and the supports. When alumina is used as support for Mo(CO)6 and (NH4)2MOO1, the ex-carbonyl catalyst is three times more active, and it is five times more active when the support is previously dehydroxylated [ 191; this behaviour is attributed to the lower oxidation state of molybdenum in the ex-carbonyl sample, giving rise to the higher activity. In the case of the present work, an increase of 100 K in the reduction temperature for Mo/C could produce a better A. Sepulveda-Escnbano. F.

For the monometallic Fe/C catalyst, an increase of 50 K in the reduction temperature (from 623 K to 673 K) leads to a higher activity. The increase in activity (per gram of metal) for CO hydrogenation of iron catalysts produced by increasing the reduction temperature is attributed to an increase in particle size by sintering and to the fact that this reaction is structure sensitive for iron catalysts. In previous work [6] with carbon-supported iron catalysts prepared from Fe(CO)s, it was shown that the activity at 523 K increases from 31 to 54 Amol-CO ~ s-- ~ g-Fe - t when the reduction temperature was increased from 673 K to 723 K, this increase in activity is parallel to an increase in particle size of the iron crystallites from 1.6 to 3.8 rim. After reduction at 623 K, the bimetallic FeMo/C catalyst is slightly more active ( based only on its iron content) than the monometallic iron sample. This activity would be somewhat lower if one considers that molybdenum also shows some activity by itself; thus, by assuming the behaviour of FeMo/C as a mixture of both Fe/C and Mo/C, an activity value of 21.1 ~cmol-CO ~ s- t ~ g-Met.` would be obtained. However, data from Table 2 indicate that the amount of CO chemisorbed at 298 K is much lower ( by nearly half) on the bimetallic FeMo/C than on the monometallic iron catalyst, after reduction at 623 K. Given that CO chemisorption at that temperature measures only superficial iron atoms, as discussed above, it follows that the catalytic activity of FeMo/C is more or less the same as that of Fe/C, but it displays a much smaller amount of superficial iron. This can be explained by the higher activity of the remaining exposed iron atoms, which could be promoted by molybdenum species. Moreover, after reduction at 673 K, the activity of the bimetallic catalyst nearly doubles that of Fe/C, although the number of exposed iron atoms is nearly the same, as obtained from CO chemisorption at 298 K, this indicates that the promoter effect of molybdenum is increased by reducing at a higher temperature. 298 A. Sepulveda-Escribano. F. Rodriguez-Reinoso /Journal of Molecular Catalysts 90 (1994) 291-301 A similar promoter effect was found by Kip et al. [25] in the Rh/MOO3/S10= system and by Mori et al. [24] in Ru/Ah03 catalysts. They observed an enhancement of carbon monoxide bond dissociation, which was related with the weakness of the C-O bond in the chemisorbed molecule. Thus, CO would be chemisorbed to an active metal site by the C atom, while the oxygen atom would be affected by a partially reduced, unsaturated atom from the metal oxide promoter. The overall effect would be the weakness of the C-O bond and, in this way, its dissociation would be easier. A higher degree of reduction of the promoter oxide would increase its effect on the oxygen atom of the CO molecule, resulting in more weakening of the C-O bond and, consequently, in a higher reaction rate, as observed when the FeMo/C catalyst was reduced at 673 K. This promoter effect remains practically constant during at least 25 h under reaction, as can be seen in Fig. 3, where the evolution of activities of both bimetallic and monometallic iron catalysts at 523 K, after reduction at 623 and 673 K, are plotted vs. time in reaction. As can be seen, the catalytic activity decreases with reaction time, due to the deposition of inactive carbon species on the catalyst surface which blocks the sites which are active for the reaction [ 37 ] . The difference between activities of Fe/C and FeMo/C are similar along the reaction run for samples reduced under the same conditions, and it is much higher after reduction at the higher temperature. The selectivities of Fe/C and FeMo/C towards the different hydrocarbons ranging from Ct to C;, after reduction of the catalysts at 673 K, are plotted in Fig. 4 as a function of reaction time. Although higher hydrocarbons (up to C6) were also detected, they have not been included in this figure for the sake of simplicity. The selectivity is practically constant during the reaction run, in spite of the decrease in the degree of conversion from 6% to 2%, due to catalyst deactivation. It can be seen that the presence of molybdenum leads to an increase in the yield of methane, with a simultaneous decrease in the production of higher hydrocarbons.

Thus, Fig. 5 shows the variation of the alkene to alkane (G +Cj) ratio for Fe/C and FeMo/C, at 523 K, after reduction at 623 K, as a function of the reaction time. In the case of Fe/C, there is an increase in alkene production during the first stage of the reaction, which corresponds to a decrease in the conversion level. This is less pronounced in the FeMo/C sample, whose alkene to alkane ratio increases slightly at the beginning of the reaction and then stabilizes at about 1.6, a value much lower than that obtained with Fe/C (3.7). A similar trend in selectivity is obtained when samples are reduced at 673 K. Thus, no correlation is observed between the great increase in activity by reducing the catalyst at a higher temperature, and the change in selectivity showing a more pronounced contribution of molybdenum, i.e., enhanced methane production and inhibition of alkene formation. 300 A.

Conclusions The presence of molybdenum in a bimetallic carbon-supported iron-molybdenum catalyst modifies the catalytic behaviour of iron in carbon monoxide hydrogenation in terms of both catalytic activity and selectivity. There is a promotional effect on activity, which is enhanced by increasing the reduction temperature. This promotion could be explained by assuming that molybdenum oxide affects the dissociation rate of CO by weakening the CO bond. On the other hand, an increase in methane production, together with an appreciable decrease in the alkenes to alkane (C.,+C;) ratio is observed with the bimetallic FeMo/C catalyst in relation to the monometallic Fe/C. Moreover, this effect on selectivity does not depend upon the reduction temperature. Acknowledgments This work was supported by CICYT (Project N. PB86/279). A.

Iron and molybdenum mono- and bimetallic catalysts supported on activated carbon have been prepared using iron pentacarbonyl and molybdenum hexacarbonyl as metal precursors. They have been characterized by temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and carbon monoxide chemisorption at 195 K and 298 K, and their catalytic activity for carbon monoxide hydrogenation at atmospheric pressure was studied under differential conditions, after reduction in hydrogen at several temperatures. Carbon monoxide chemisorption on the monometallic molybdenum catalyst was found to be strongly temperature dependent. On the other hand, the irreversible carbon monoxide chemisorption was largely decreased in the bimetallic catalyst in relation to the monometallic iron sample. The effect of molybdenum on the catalytic activity of FeMo/C is very important, producing an increase in catalytic activity which is very dependent on the reduction temperature. The selectivity of the monometallic iron catalyst is strongly modified by molybdenum addition, which produces a great increase in the yield to methane and a decrease in the alkenes to alkanes (C2 + C3) ratio.
