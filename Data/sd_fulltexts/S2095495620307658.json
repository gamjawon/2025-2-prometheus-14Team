Key Laboratory for Green Chemical Technology of MOE School of Chemical Engineering and Technology Tianjin University Tianjin 300072 China Graphical abstract The integrated structure of CoB/BN@rGO facilitates the remarkable increase of adsorption/catalytic sites and enhances its catalytic capability to LPS conversion, that leads to improved electrochemical performances of LSB. Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are hampered by the infamous shuttle effect and slow redox kinetics, resulting in rapid capacity decay. Herein, a bifunctional catalysis CoB/BN@rGO with integrated structure and synergy effect between adsorption and catalysis is proposed to solve the above problems. The integrated CoB and BN are simultaneously and uniformly introduced on the rGO substrate through a one-step calcination strategy, applied to modify the cathode side of PP separator. The transition metal borides can catalyze the conversion of lithium polysulfides (Li2S n , n ≥ 4), whereas the bond of B-S is too weak to absorb LPS. Thus BN introduced can effectively restrict the diffusion of polysulfides via strong chemisorption with LiS n Li+ ⋯N, while the rGO substrate ensures smooth electron transfer for redox reaction. Therefore, through the integrated adsorption/catalysis, the shuttle effect is suppressed, the kinetics of redox reaction is enhanced, and the capacity decay is reduced. Using CoB/BN@rGO modified PP separator, the Li-S batteries with high initial capacity (1450 mAh g−1 at 0.35 mA cm−2) and long-cycle stability (700 cycles at 1.74 mA cm−2 with a decay rate of 0.032% per cycle) are achieved. This work provides a novel insight for the preparation of bifunctional catalysis with integrated structure for long-life Li-S batteries. Keywords Integrated structure Synergy effect Bifunctional catalysis Separator Li-S batteries 1 Introduction Li-S batteries have received widespread attention due to high theoretical specific capacity (1675 mAh g−1) and energy density (~2600 Wh kg−1) [1], abundant raw materials, and eco-friendly and cheap element sulfur [2], showing promising prospects in energy storage and conversion fields. There are two main multi-electron redox reactions in Li-S batteries. One is the conversion process with fast reaction kinetics from solid (S8) to liquid (Li2S n , 4 ≤ n ≤ 8). Another is the conversion process with slow reaction kinetics from liquid (Li2S n , 4 ≤ n ≤ 8) to solid (Li2S2/Li2S) [3,4]. High activation energy is required in the process of liquid–solid conversion, which leads to the accumulation of soluble lithium polysulfides (LPS), and serious shuttle effect [5,6], thus resulting in the corrosion of anode and rapid capacity decay [7,8]. Therefore, designing functional materials to modify the separator is considered to be one of the most effective methods to suppress the shuttle effect via physical/chemical adsorption or catalysis in recent years [9–13]. Unsatisfactorily, even if the strong physical/chemical affinity with LPS can prevent the diffusion of LPS to a certain extent, there are still two problems: (i) the intercepted LPS may accumulate on the surface of the modified separator. In the case of high sulfur content and long-term cycling, the accumulated LPS will lead to high electrolyte viscosity and low reaction kinetics, thereby increasing Li+ diffusion resistance [14,15]. (ii) With the accumulation of LPS, the physical or chemical absorption has little effect on the kinetics of accelerating the conversion of LPS and intrinsically inhibiting the shuttle effect. Therefore, catalyzing the conversion of long-chain LPS with promoted reaction kinetics is another effective way to suppress the shuttle effect and improve the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries [16–18]. Many researchers have found that transition metal (Ni, Co) and noble metal (Pt) as active sites have catalytic effects on the conversion of LPS, which can promote the redox kinetics of LPS to suppress the shuttle effect to a certain extent [19–22]. Among them, transition metals are widely used in the field of catalysis due to their low price [23,24]. Notably, transition metal borides not only possess metal catalytic sites, but also have adsorption capacity to LPS through B-S bonds due to the empty orbital [25], which contributes to catalyze the conversion of LPS more effectively according to the catalytic theory. This mechanism of integrated adsorption/catalysis is beneficial to promote the catalytic transformation and boost the reaction kinetics of LPS in Li-S batteries. However, the adsorption capacity of LPS by B-S bond (-0.34 eV) is not intense enough [26], so lots of LPS cannot be captured in time for catalytic conversion during the process of rapid charging and discharging. As a result, the Li-S batteries with transition metal boride as functional material have poor rate performance [25]. In this situation, it’s necessary to introduce the doping of nitrogen with enhanced adsorption capacity for LPS while catalyzing [27–29]. It has been verified that pyridinic N and pyrrolic N in nitrogen doping are effective to moderate LPS diffusion in forming LiS n Li+ ⋯N based on first-principles calculations [15]. Furthermore, polar N atoms with adjacent metal/nonmetal atoms also enable nitrides to possess strong chemical affinity with LPS. Taking BN as the example, N atoms and the adjacent B atoms are conducive to the formation of N = B/N-B structure, which contributes to reinforce the polarization of both B atoms and N atoms simultaneously [30–32]. Besides, layered structure of BN also benefits to the dense exposure of dual B and N active sites, leading to enhanced chemisorption with LPS [33]. In this case, the adsorption and catalytic sites are not integrated when they are ex-situ compounded, which becomes the most important kinetic controlling step hindering the transformation of LPS adsorbed to catalytic sites at a high rate. In order to synergistically combine the adsorption and catalysis of LPS, a bifunctional separator coating (CoB/BN@rGO) towards the cathode side is designed to inhibit the shuttle effect. The one-step calcination strategy is adopted to introduce CoB and BN simultaneously and uniformly in this work. The integrated synergy effect between adsorption and catalysis is proven by intuitive physical and electrochemical tests, expressing that LPS can be catalyzed timely by the surrounding cobalt sites after being adsorbed by B-S bond of CoB and LiS n Li+ ⋯N of BN (Scheme 1 ), thereby enhancing the redox kinetics. Additionally, rGO is essential to guarantee the rapid electron transmission during the catalytic redox reaction. When CoB/BN@rGO acts as the modified material of the bifunctional separator, long-term cycle and rate tests are performed on Li-S batteries to further evaluate the effects of CoB/BN@rGO on the suppression of shuttle effect due to the integrated adsorption/catalysis with LPS. 2 Experimental The detailed information of all raw materials used below are shown in Table S1. 2.1 Materials preparation 2.1.1 Preparation of CoB/BN@rGO, CoB@rGO, BN@rGO and rGO MOF@GO precursor: MOF@GO was prepared through a hydrothermal method referring to the previous work [34]. 15.0 g graphene oxide solution (1.6 wt%) was diluted with 35.0 mL methanol solution, and the mixture was ultrasonicated for 0.5 h. Followed by adding 20.0 mL methanol solution with 1.0 g cobalt acetate tetrahydrate. After stirring for 0.5 h, 25.0 mL methanol solution in which 0.3 g 2, 5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid was dissolved was added dropwise into the above solution with vigorous stirring. Subsequently, the resulting mixture was further stirred for 2 h at room temperature. Finally, the product obtained above was washed with methanol and water, and then it was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave with 25.0 mL water at 180 °C for 24 h. The resulting product was named as MOF@GO. CoB/BN@rGO: Since the formation temperatures of BN and CoB are different [35], a strategy of staged calcination was adopted. MOF@GO and boron trioxide (B2O3) were grounded and mixed in a mass ratio of 1 : 1. Then they were placed in a graphite boat to calcining in tube furnace at Ar atmosphere (0.1 L/min) with a heating rate of 5 °C/min. Firstly, the temperature was raised to 800 °C for 2 h to reduce GO, then it was continued to heat up to 900 °C for 2 h to obtain BN species, and the gas introduced was replaced with NH3 during this stage. Subsequently, the CoB species was acquired when temperature was warmed up to 1150 °C for 4 h at Ar atmosphere again. Finally, the product was cooled down naturally, followed by washing with hot water to remove excess B2O3 and gain CoB/BN@rGO. CoB@rGO and BN@rGO were prepared without NH3 atmosphere and only at 900 °C, respectively. rGO was obtained by calcining aforementioned GO at Ar atmosphere with the same temperature program of CoB/BN@rGO. 2.1.2 Synthesis of polysulfides electrolytes To synthesize Li2S8, Li2S and S in molar ratio of 1 : 7 were added to a mixture of 1, 3-dioxolane and 1, 2-dimethylsilane (DOL : DME = 1 : 1) containing 1 wt% LiNO3. Then the mixture was heat at 80 °C for 24 h in a glove box filled with Ar to obtain Li2S8 electrolyte with a concentration of 1.2 mol/L (based on element S). Li2S6 electrolyte was prepared with Li2S and S in molar ratio of 1 : 5 using the same method. 2.1.3 Synthesis of CoB/BN@rGO modified PP separators CoB/BN@rGO, Super P and PVDF were ground and mixed with a mass ratio of 8 : 1 : 1, and then were dispersed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solution ultrasonicating for 1 h. Subsequently, the obtained suspension was filtered onto the commercial Celgard 2500 separator, and then dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C for 12 h. The PP separators modified with CoB@rGO or BN@rGO were also obtained just by substituting CoB@rGO or BN@rGO for CoB/BN@rGO. 2.1.4 Synthesis of cathodes For the cathodes used in Li-S batteries, carbon cloth was used as the sulfur host by dropping the Li2S8 solution (1.2 mol L-1) onto it, and named as CC-S in this work. The sulfur content of each CC-S cathode (Ф=13 mm) was 1.5 mg cm−2. For the synthesis of the CoB/BN@rGO cathodes used in symmetrical cells, the CoB/BN@rGO, Super P and PVDF were ground and mixed with a mass ratio of 8 : 1 : 1 using NMP as a solvent. Then the mud mixture was cast onto the aluminum foil, and dried in a 50 °C vacuum oven for 24 h. The cathodes modified with CoB@rGO, BN@rGO or rGO were also gained just by substituting CoB@rGO, BN@rGO or rGO for CoB/BN@rGO. In particular, CNT/S is used as the electrode for Li-S batteries with high sulfur loading. CNT (carbon nanotube) and sulfur were mixed by ball milling with a mass ratio of 75 : 15, and then melted at 155 °C for 12 h in Ar atmosphere. Afterwards, the mixture, Super P and PVDF were ground and mixed with a mass ratio of 8 : 1 : 1 using NMP as a solvent. Finally, the mud mixture was cast onto the aluminum foil, and dried in a 50 °C vacuum oven for 24 h to obtain the CNT/S cathode. 2.2 Adsorption and catalytic tests 2.2.1 Polysulfides adsorption test Taking Li2S6 adsorption test as an example, 23 mg Super P, rGO, BN@rGO, CoB@rGO, and CoB/BN@rGO were dispersed in 2.5 ml Li2S6 electrolyte of 24 mmol L-1 (diluting the previous Li2S6 electrolyte to 24 mmol L-1 based on element S), separately. After resting for 12/48 h, the supernatant of the mixtures was detected by Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectrophotometry. 2.2.2 Catalytic property test Symmetrical cells were assembled to explore the catalytic performance of CoB/BN@rGO. Typically, CoB/BN@rGO electrode (CoB/BN@rGO coated on aluminum foil) was used as counter and working electrode with 40 μL electrolyte containing Li2S8 (1.2 mol L-1, based on element S). Then, the CV test was performed from −1.0 to 1.0 V with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. The assembly of symmetrical cells modified with CoB@rGO, BN@rGO or rGO only requires the replacement of CoB/BN@rGO by CoB@rGO, BN@rGO or rGO, separately. 2.3 Characterizations 2.3.1 Material characterization Scanning electron microscope (SEM, S-4800 and Regulus 8100) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F) were carried out to gain the morphology, size and location information of the as-prepared materials. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fisher, ESCALAB 250Xi K-Alpha), X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/max 2500, Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5406 Å and recorded under the 2θ range of 10°-80°) and UV–vis spectrophotometry (UNIC UV4802) were examined to receive the surface, crystal structure and composition messages. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, TA-50) was carried out to estimate the content of rGO in CoB/BN@rGO composites. To analyze the amount of adsorption and catalytic sites, the temperature programed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) was conducted by Mack instruments Auto Chem II 2920 with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 to 700 °C. 2.3.2 Electrochemical measurement Electrochemical measurements were performed by CR 2430 coin cells, using carbon cloth dripped with Li2S8 solution as the cathode, pure lithium foil as the anode, and BN@rGO, CoB@rGO, CoB/BN@rGO modified PP with areal density of 0.3 mg cm−2 or pure PP as the separator. The electrolyte is 1 M LiTFSI in the mixture of 1, 3-dioxolane and 1, 2-dimethylsilane (DOL : DME = 1 : 1) with the 1 wt% LiNO3 additive. And the amount of electrolyte added is controlled to be 25 μL mgS -1 in each cell. Especially, for the cells with high sulfur-loading under lean electrolyte conditions, different weights of CNT/S electrodes were used to obtain different areal densities (4.6 ~ 5.1 mg cm−2). In addition, the E/S of these cell is controlled to be 8.5 μL mgS -1 (assuming the dead space in CR 2430 coin cell accommodates extra 8.0 μL electrolyte [19]). The LAND CT2001A battery tester was used for galvanostatic charge/discharge tests from 1.7 to 2.8 V at different current densities. The electrochemical workstation (CHI660E) was used for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements (100 kHz-10 mHz) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests from 1.7 to 2.8 V with a low scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. Especially, the CV tests of symmetrical cells were performed under a voltage range of −1.0–1.0 V with the scan rate of 10 mV s−1. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 The fabrication of integrated bifunctional CoB/BN@rGO separator The preparation process of CoB/BN@rGO bifunctional separator with integrated adsorption/catalysis via a facile one-step calcination method was shown in Scheme 2 . Firstly, Co-MOF was in situ grown on graphene oxide (GO) substrate (MOF@GO) through a hydrothermal method [34]. Subsequently, using MOF@GO as the precursor, one-step calcination strategy was adopted to introduce BN and CoB simultaneously to obtain CoB/BN@rGO. Finally, the prepared CoB/BN@rGO was served as the bifunctional material to filter onto the commercial PP separator. The CoB and BN are successfully engineered onto the rGO substrate at the same time. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrums in Fig. 1 (a) and Fig. S1 show the peaks of CoB/BN@rGO consist of CoB (PDF#03–0959), BN (PDF#34–0421) and Co (PDF#15–0806). It’s noting that the Co species also exists in BN@rGO, thus in the following data comparison, Co is not the main-influencing factor. The results of XRD intuitively prove the successful synthesis of the main CoB and BN species. Besides, the existences of CoB and BN are proved by X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) of CoB/BN@rGO from the atomic level. As shown in Fig. 1(b and c), the peaks located at 399.66 and 191.78 eV correspond to N = B/N-B and B = N/B-N bonds of BN, respectively. The peak located at 191.29 eV (Fig. 1c) attributes to B-Co bond of CoB [36]. In addition, the XPS spectrum of N 1 s (Fig. 1b) shows that near the peak of N = B/N-B bond, there are pyridinic N, pyrrolic N and graphitic N, which can adsorb LPS to limit their diffusion [37]. Moreover, the atomic ratio of CoB and BN is 53.5: 46.5 corresponding to the peak area ratio of B-Co and B = N/B-N bonds in Fig. 1(c). And the mass proportion of rGO is 50% detected by Thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. S2). In the XPS spectrum of Co 2p (Fig. 1d), the peak at 774.20 eV is assigned to metal cobalt, the two peaks at 782.50 and 798.63 eV match with Co3+, and the peaks at 787.60 and 804.90 eV are assigned to Co2+ [25], thus the cobalt element in CoB/BN@rGO composite exists in mixed valence. The introduction of BN and CoB on the rGO substrate contributes to different morphologies although the same MOF@GO was used as the precursor. The MOF@GO shows the typical GO package on the outer layer of MOF (Fig. S3). However, after calcination, compared with the SEM images of CoB@rGO and BN@rGO (Fig. S4), CoB/BN@rGO presents a thinner and more uniform flower-like structure particularly (Fig. 2 a), which contributes to the exposure of adsorption and catalytic active sites. The particles on the surface of CoB/BN@rGO are proved to be Co0 by line scan (Fig. 2b). As shown in Fig. S5, the Co, B, N, C elements distribute uniformly, proving the homogeneous and integrated existence of CoB, BN and rGO, which can promote LPS to be catalyzed timely by the close CoB sites after being adsorbed by BN sites and B-S bond of CoB. However, the lattice fringes in TEM image of CoB and rGO are observed simultaneously in Fig. 2(c), while that of BN is not shown, the reason for this phenomenon is that the characteristic peak of BN in XRD spectrum is wider, indicating that BN has a low crystallinity without distinct lattice fringes. Thus, BN exists in an amorphous form, the lattice fringe of 0.241 nm corresponds to (101) crystal plane of CoB after the calculation in the inset of Fig. 2(c), rGO lies in the edge of the sheet. The obtained CoB/BN@rGO materials are mixed with Super P and PVDF, and then filtered onto the commercial PP separator. The thickness of the bifunctional coating is 6.77 μm, achieving a low areal density of 0.3 mg cm−2 (Fig. 2d). This thin and uniform CoB/BN@rGO coating is beneficial to reduce the introduction of non-active substances in batteries. 3.2 Enhanced interaction with LPS due to catalysis and adsorption To detect the accelerated electrocatalytic conversion of LPS caused by CoB in Li-S batteries, symmetrical cells are gathered via inserting two identical CoB@rGO electrodes in an electrolyte with Li2S8-containing. As shown by the dotted line in Fig. 3 (a), the polarization voltage of CoB@rGO is smaller than that of rGO (0.618 vs. 0.771 V), and the current density of CoB@rGO increases significantly, which suggests that the activation energy required for LPS conversion can be reduced due to the catalysis of CoB species [38,39]. However, it is worth noting that after resting for 12 h, the color of the Li2S6 solution containing CoB@rGO remains initial yellow color until 48 h when it becomes lighter in polysulfides adsorption test (Fig. S6). While the color of the solution containing rGO still exhibits yellow after resting for 48 h. These phenomena indicate the relatively weak anchoring ability of CoB in CoB@rGO to LPS, thereby resulting the requirements of rapid adsorption and desorption of LPS at high rate cannot be met. In this case, it is essential to introduce BN with strong adsorption capacity for LPS simultaneously in order to strengthen the effect of integrated adsorption/catalysis. The chemical adsorption capacity to LPS of BN@rGO was confirmed visually and qualitatively by polysulfides adsorption test and Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) test (Fig. S6). After resting for 12 h, different from the yellow solution with CoB@rGO, the solution containing BN@rGO becomes light. Apparently, the peak of BN@rGO is lower than that of CoB@rGO in UV–vis test, indicating the strong chemical interaction between BN and LPS. More importantly, the solution with CoB/BN@rGO becomes transparent firstly, and the peak of CoB/BN@rGO is the lowest, which means that the enhanced interaction with LPS should be attributed to the synergy effect between CoB and BN. Correspondingly, in Fig. 3(b) (Temperature-programmed desorption of NH3, NH3-TPD), CoB/BN@rGO has the richest adsorption/catalytic sites, indicating that the integration of CoB and BN in sample CoB/BN@rGO greatly gears up the whole catalysis capability [40]. Besides, it’s noting that the integral area of CoB/BN@rGO doubles if compares to the sum of CoB@rGO and BN@rGO who takes the mole ratio of CoB to BN (53.5 : 46.5) into account, indicating that the integration of CoB and BN in CoB/BN@rGO, other than mixing them together, directly leads to a remarkable increase of adsorption/catalytic sites with low activation energy (Fig. S7 and Table S2). In addition, the amount of medium-strong acid sites in CoB/BN@rGO increases too. Due to their media acidity, they mainly play the role of stable capture/adsorption of LPS and refusing LPS shuttle. In all, the integrated structure enables CoB/BN@rGO to have more adsorption/catalytic sites that are skillful of expediting LPS-relating catalytic conversions. To further reveal the enhanced catalytic effect of CoB/BN@rGO facilitated by introducing BN, symmetrical cells inserting two identical BN@rGO and CoB/BN@rGO electrodes in an electrolyte with Li2S8-containing are also gathered. As shown by the solid line in Fig. 3(a), the current density of CoB/BN@rGO is the highest, and its polarization voltage is smaller than that of CoB@rGO and BN@rGO (0.461 vs. 0.618 V and 0.461 vs. 0.824 V, respectively), which suggests that the integrated adsorption/catalysis of BN and CoB enhances the catalysis of CoB/BN@rGO, resulting in the optimal performance of CoB/BN@rGO. To reveal the intrinsic interaction between CoB/BN@rGO and LPS due to integrated adsorption/catalysis, XPS to CoB/BN@rGO was implemented before or after adsorption of Li2S6 (Fig. 3c-e). In comparison with the N 1s of CoB/BN@rGO before adsorption, these four characteristic peaks of N = B/N-B, pyridinic N, pyrrolic N and graphitic N after adsorption overall upshift to higher binding energy (Fig. 3c), indicating the electron transfer from exposed N sites to Li+. Inversely, after adsorption of Li2S6, the peaks of Co 2p downshift to lower binding energy, where Co2+, Co0 and Co3+, is offset by 0.59, 0.40 and 0.31 eV, respectively (Fig. 3d), suggesting the electron transfer from the electron-rich polysulfides anions to cobalt sites. Therefore, the results express that the interaction between CoB/BN@rGO and LPS can be enhanced by LiS n Li+ ⋯N and Co-polysulfides. Meanwhile, compared that there is no significant change in peak area of Co3+ after adsorption, the peak area of Co0 increases by 46% than that before adsorption, while the peak areas of Co2+ 2p 3/2 and Co2+ 2p 1/2 decrease by 27% and 20%, respectively (Fig. 3d). The reason for this case is that part of Co2+ is reduced to Co0 during the process of LPS catalytic oxidation. In addition, Fig. 3(e) exhibits S 2p XPS spectrum of CoB/BN@rGO after Li2S6 adsorption test. Apparently, the species of S2O3 2- (167.01 eV) and polythionate complex (168.41 eV) are detected, they are intermediate products produced during the oxidation of LPS [41]. Therefore, the Co2+ sites in CoB/BN@rGO have the mainly catalytic effect on enhancing the kinetics of the conversion of LPS to Li2S. 3.3 Electrochemical performance To identify the integrated synergistic effect of CoB/BN@rGO on propelling the redox kinetics of LPS from electrochemical performance, both cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed. The CV of cells were tested at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s−1 with a voltage window from 1.7 to 2.8 V in Fig. 4 (a). There are two obvious reduction peaks during scanning, assigned to the reduction transformation of sulfur to long-chain LPS and the successive to insoluble lithium sulfide, respectively [15,42]. And the two oxidation peaks belong to the oxidation transformation from Li2S2/Li2S to LPS and S8 [43]. Obviously, compared with the cell assembled with pure PP, the cells with BN@rGO, CoB@rGO, CoB/BN@rGO have higher redox current. Furthermore, the polarization potentials of the cells with BN@rGO and CoB@rGO both are 0.135 V, lower than that of the cell with pure PP (0.236 V), indicating that the adsorption (BN) and catalysis (CoB) effects are essential to decrease the voltage polarization. Even more momentously, the polarization potential of the cell with CoB/BN@rGO is only 0.084 V, and the reason for this case is that the redox kinetics of LPS is facilitated by the integrated synergy effect between uniformly distributed BN and CoB sites. Besides, the cell with CoB/BN@rGO has the highest reduction and the lowest oxidation potential, suggesting that the bifunctional CoB/BN@rGO can reduce the activation energy to enhance the kinetics of the redox reactions effectively. Additionally, the EIS spectrums of different cells with CoB/BN@rGO, CoB@rGO and BN@rGO before/after cycling are shown in Fig. 4(b) and Fig. S8. And the fitted values of interfacial resistance (R surf) and charge transfer resistance (R ct) are shown in Table S3. The cell with CoB/BN@rGO before/after 30th discharging exhibits smaller R surf (19.41/1.71 Ω for CoB/BN@rGO, 32.5/11.08 Ω for pure PP), indicating a faster Li+ diffusion through the interfacial nanolayers from electrolyte to surfaces of electrodes and separator [38,44–46]. However, R ct (the charge transfer at the interfaces of cathodes-LPS and separator-LPS) after cycling is larger than before cycling [47]. Especially, the values of R ct increase more clearly after cycling for the cells with CoB/BN@rGO and CoB@rGO modified separators. The reason for this phenomenon is that the EIS tests were completed in discharging state, and the catalytic sites of CoB were surrounded by the discharging product Li2S2/Li2S. Compared with cells modified with CoB@rGO, BN@rGO or pure PP, the cell with CoB/BN@rGO exhibits the optimal R surf and R ct due to the integrated synergy effect between BN and CoB, indicating that the fastest ion/electron transfer is beneficial to boost the redox kinetics of LPS. On account of the enhanced interaction with LPS, CoB/BN@rGO modification endows the Li-S batteries with well rate performance and long-term stability. As shown in Fig. 4(c), compared with CoB@rGO and BN@rGO, the CoB/BN@rGO modified cell with a sulfur loading of 1.5 mg cm−2 delivers higher reversible capacities of 1450.0, 881.6, 572.6 and 480.2 mAh g−1 at 0.35, 1.74, 5.22 and 8.70 mA cm−2, separately. Meanwhile, the current areal density of the cell with CoB/BN@rGO reaches 4 ~ 5 times that with PP at low rate when the same capacity is realized, and even at high rate there still is 2.5 times (Table S4). This elucidates that such excellent rate performance is promoted by CoB/BN@rGO through boosting the kinetics of redox conversion and inhibiting shuttle effect. Therefore, a higher-capacity and stable Li-S battery with CoB/BN@rGO than that with pure PP can be achieved (Fig. 4d and Fig. S9). The cell with CoB/BN@rGO achieves high initial capacities of 1068.6 and 915.2 mAh g−1 at 0.87 and 1.74 mA cm−2, respectively. After 700 cycles, there are still 779.5 and 711.5 mAh g−1 reversible capacities with the capacity retention rates of 72.9% and 77.7%, separately. Notably, the cell modified with CoB/BN@rGO has the decay rates of only 0.039% and 0.032% per cycle after 700 cycles at 0.87 and 1.74 mA cm−2, respectively. The capacity decay rate of the cell at low rate is higher than that at high rate, because it takes more time to complete a cycle at low rate than at high rate. In this case, on one hand, LPS will have enough time to diffuse resulting in more serious shuttle effects at low rate than at high rate. On the other hand, more S8 can be converted into LPS at low rate, and more LPS will diffuse to the anode side due to the concentration difference, which also causes shuttle effect further, resulting in higher capacity decay. What’s more, when sulfur-loading increases to 5.1 mg cm−2 under lean electrolyte conditions (E/S = 8.5), the cell with CoB/BN@rGO delivers the areal capacity of 3.6 mAh cm−2 (713.2 mAh g−1) at 0.4 mA cm−2 (the inset in Fig. 4b). Besides, it’s noting that the cell still shows a capacity of 520.8 mAh g−1 even at 1.2 mA cm−2 (Fig. S10). Apparently, compared with the data of low sulfur-loading (Fig. 4c and d), there is no obvious change in stability and rate performance for the cell with CoB/BN@rGO under the conditions of high sulfur-loading and low E/S ratio. On this basis, this work is compared with recent-reported work (Table S5), which further indicates that CoB/BN@rGO with integrated structure shows good potential in the catalysis of LPS conversion and suppression of shuttle effect effectively. The stability of the CoB/BN@rGO material is essential for the cell with excellent long-life stability, so that the surfaces of separators and anodes in different cells before/after cycling were detected as shown in Fig. 5 . As shown in Fig. 5(a-c), the surfaces of the separators remain intact after 1000 cycles at 0.87 and 1.74 mA cm−2 on the macro, and there is no collapse in the microstructure (Fig. S11), indicating the good structural stability of CoB/BN@rGO material. Fig. 5(d-f) show the changes of the lithium anodes before or after 1000 cycles at 0.87 and 1.74 mA cm−2. It can be seen that the surfaces of lithium anodes are relatively flat without apparent lithium dendrite. Notably, the surface of the lithium anode after 1000 cycles at 0.87 mA cm−2 is rougher than that at 1.74 mA cm−2 due to the more serious shuttle effect at low rate than high rate, which is consistent with the result of cycle test (Fig. 4d). Evidently, while ensuring its structural integrity, CoB/BN@rGO can also impede the shuttle effect by absorbing and catalyzing LPS integrally, thereby alleviating the corrosion of lithium anode. And a Li-S battery with long-life and excellent stability can be achieved. 4 Conclusion The CoB/BN@rGO material was rationally and uniformly synthesized through one-step calcination strategy and used as a bifunctional catalysis for Li-S batteries due to the integrated structure and synergy effect between adsorption and catalysis. Due to that the bifunctional separator suppresses the shuttle effect and enhances the conversion kinetics of LPS effectively, the rate performance of the cell with CoB/BN@rGO modified separator is promoted by 2.5 ~ 5.0 times. The inhibition of LPS diffusion mainly comes from the strong chemisorption via LiS n Li+ ⋯N bond. CoB and BN sites are uniform and integrated, which helps LPS to be catalyzed timely by the integrated CoB sites after being adsorbed by B-S bond of CoB and LiS n Li+ ⋯N of BN, thereby enhancing the redox kinetics of LPS conversion. Besides, the rapid electron transfer is attributed to high conductivity of rGO during the catalytic redox reaction. Due to the integrated structure and synergy effect, a Li-S battery with CoB/BN@rGO modified PP separator possesses a high capacity (1450 mAh g−1 at 0.35 mA cm−2) and long-life stability (700 cycles at 1.74 mA cm−2 with a decay rate of 0.032% per cycle). Certainly, the uniform fabrication of the bifunctional catalysis with integrated structure in this work provides a novel insight for the design of functional separator to improve life stability of Li-S batteries.

        "dc:description": "Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are hampered by the infamous shuttle effect and slow redox kinetics, resulting in rapid capacity decay. Herein, a bifunctional catalysis CoB/BN@rGO with integrated structure and synergy effect between adsorption and catalysis is proposed to solve the above problems. The integrated CoB and BN are simultaneously and uniformly introduced on the rGO substrate through a one-step calcination strategy, applied to modify the cathode side of PP separator. The transition metal borides can catalyze the conversion of lithium polysulfides (Li2S n , n ≥ 4), whereas the bond of B-S is too weak to absorb LPS. Thus BN introduced can effectively restrict the diffusion of polysulfides via strong chemisorption with LiS n Li+ ⋯N, while the rGO substrate ensures smooth electron transfer for redox reaction. Therefore, through the integrated adsorption/catalysis, the shuttle effect is suppressed, the kinetics of redox reaction is enhanced, and the capacity decay is reduced. Using CoB/BN@rGO modified PP separator, the Li-S batteries with high initial capacity (1450 mAh g−1 at 0.35 mA cm−2) and long-cycle stability (700 cycles at 1.74 mA cm−2 with a decay rate of 0.032% per cycle) are achieved. This work provides a novel insight for the preparation of bifunctional catalysis with integrated structure for long-life Li-S batteries.",
