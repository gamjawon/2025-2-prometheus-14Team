II. Reactions of acrolein and allyl alcohol C. Hoang-Van*, O. Zegaoui1 URA au CNRS Photocatalyse, Catalyse et Environnernent, Ecole Centrale de Lyon, BP 163, 69131 Ecully Cedex, France Received 3 March 1997; received in revised form 18 April 1997; accepted 18 April 1997 Abstract The vapor-phase hydrogenation of acrolein, as a model molecule representing the a,3-unsaturated aldehydes, was studied over Pt powder and Pt dispersed on SiO2, A1203 and ultrafine MoO3 and WO3 particles. The hydrogenation and isomerization of allyl alcohol were also investigated to obtain additional information about the effects of the supports and the network of these reactions. In the hydrogenation of acrolein, allyl alcohol was significantly produced only over Pt/MoO3 and Pt/WO3 catalysts previously reduced in the temperature range 673-773 K. This supports the proposal that adlineation sites created at the Pt-MoO3 and Pt-WO3 interfaces following a reduction at high temperature are responsible for the activation of carbonyl bonds. Also these adlineation sites, which contain electron-deficient cations resulting from a partial reduction of the oxide support, favor the isomerization of allyl alcohol to propanal at the expense of its hydrogenation to propanol. By contrast, for prereduction temperatures below ca. 573 K, the catalytic behavior of Pt/MoO3 and Pt/WO3 in the two reaction tests was not distinctly different from that of conventional Pt catalysts, which suggests that the molybdenum and tungsten hydrogen bronze supports do not markedly influence the catalytic properties of Pt catalysts. 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Furthermore, a partial reduction of the MoO3 and WO3 supports was evidenced for catalysts reduced at high temperature [1]. The present paper reports on the effects of MoO3 and WO3 supports on the catalytic properties of platinum for selective hydrogenations of acrolein and of allyl alcohol.

Hydrogenation of allyl alcohol, which may be an intermediate product in the hydrogenation of acrolein, can give rise to different reaction products as a result of the isomerization and/or hydrogenolysis processes, in addition to propanol [3,4]. The distribu- tion of those products may reflect the effect of the support on the catalytic properties of the deposited metal [3,4]. bottom, as Pt-Mo, Pt-W, Pt-A1, Pt-Si and Pt black, respectively. 2.2. Characterization techniques The techniques employed included surface area measurements, X-ray diffraction analysis, transmis- sion electron microscopy, H2 consumption and CO chemisorption measurements. They have already been described [1]. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts The catalysts were prepared by shaking 1 g of the support with 10 cm3 of water containing the required amount of hexachloroplatinic acid. Evaporation of the solvent was carried out at 343 K under continuous stirring and the samples were then dried at 373 K overnight. Finely divided MoO3 and WO3 obtained in a flame reactor, previously submitted to a treatment at 673 K in air for 24 h [1], were used as supports. For compar- ison, commercial alumina and silica were also employed as supports. Table 1 shows the catalysts studied in this work, together with the Pt content, the nature and surface area of the support. Throughout the text, the catalysts listed in the first column of Table 1 are designated, from the top to the Table 1 Catalyst compositions and designations Catalysta Support Oxide Surface area (m2g ~) 0.2% Pt-Mo MoO3 40 0.1% Pt-W WO3 45 0.4% Pt-A1 7-A1203 (Degussa, 100 oxide C) 1.0% Pt-Si SiO2 (Degussa, 130 130 V) Pt blackb -- 18 ~Mo: MOO3; W: WO3; AI: A1203; Si: SiO2.

Activity measurements The vapor-phase hydrogenation experiments were performed in an atmospheric microreactor system. The flow apparatus was heated with heating wire to prevent condensation of organic compounds inside the stainless steel tubes. The gas flow rates were regulated by mass flow controllers (Brooks, 5850 TR series). The constant flow of hydrogen was purified by passing it over a BTS catalyst to remove O2 and then over a 4 .~ molecular sieve to remove water. The catalyst (2- 25 mg), admixed with inactive glass powder (total mass: 100 mg) was reduced in situ by passing a flow of hydrogen (ca. 2 dm3 h-l) at different temperatures, from 323 to 773 K for Pt-Mo and Pt-W catalysts and at 773 K for Pt-A1 and Pt-Si catalysts, for 3 h. Pt black was reduced at 433 K to prevent a severe sintering. Throughout the text, the in situ reduction of catalysts prior to reactions will be referred to as \"pretreat- ment\". After the pretreatment, the reactor was cooled to 323 K which was the reaction temperature adopted in this work. Acrolein or allyl alcohol (both from Merck; >99% purity) were introduced into the reactor system by passing a flow of hydrogen through a saturator filled with acrolein (at 243 K) or allyl alcohol (at 293 K). The partial pressures of hydrogen and acrolein were 98 and 2 kPa, respectively, and those of hydrogen and allyl alcohol were 97.6 and 2.4 kPa, respectively. Total flow rate was typically 3.6 dm3 h-1. The reactions were followed by periodic analysis of gas samples by a gas chromatograph (Intersmat IGC 120 FB) equipped with a flame ioniza- tion detector (FID) using a 4 m stainless column packed with 10% carbowax 20M on chromosorb (80/100 mesh). Usually, the experiments were per- formed at low conversions (<5%) to avoid secondary reactions as much as possible. For all catalysts studied, C. Hoang-Van, O. Zegaoui/Applied Catalysis A: General 164 (1997) 91-103 93 the activity noticeably declined during the first 2 h but remained almost constant thereafter. In this study, the activity measurements were performed by extrapolat- ing the pseudo-plateaus of the activity curves to zero time reaction. Selectivities were calculated from the expression nP 100%, s,- where nv is the number of moles of product i detected in the outstream after reaction. capable of adsorbing and activating the C=O group of acrolein were created. On the other hand, it was found that the Pt-W catalyst pretreated at high temperature was much more selective to allyl alcohol for acrolein hydrogenation than its homolog Pt-Mo pretreated under the same conditions (see below, Table 5 and Fig. 1), which underlined the effect of the supports on the catalytic properties of Pt catalysts. The results summarized in Table 2 were taken into account for determining the catalytic properties of Pt-Mo and Pt-W catalysts in acrolein hydrogenation. 3. Results 3.1. Hydrogenation of acrolein 3.1.1. Activity and selectivity of supports No activity in the hydrogenation of acrolein at 323 K was observed for conventional supports (A1203, SiO2) pretreated at 773 K. In contrast, MoO3 and WO3 pretreated between 433 and 673 K exhibited slight activities in this reaction (Table 2, column 3). MoO3 pretreated in the range 573-673 K showed 100% selectivity toward propanol whereas WO3 pretreated in the same temperature range exhibited 100% selec- tivity toward allyl alcohol (Table 2, columns 6 and 5, respectively). This result suggests that, on WO3 pre- treated above ca. 573 K, highly electron-deficient sites 3.1.2. Activity and selectivity of conventional platinum catalysts Table 3 shows the activities and selectivities of Pt- AI, Pt-Si and Pt black catalysts in the hydrogenation of acrolein at 323 K. Activities are expressed by the rates of acrolein disappearance per gram of platinum (column 2) or by the turnover frequencies (column 3) based on CO chemisorption measurements using a pulse flow system described in [5]. The activity of conventional platinum catalysts in acrolein hydrogeneration decreased in the order: Pt-Si>Pt-AI>>Pt black (Table 3, columns 2 and 3). These catalysts converted acrolein almost quantita- tively into propanal (99-100% selectivity, column 4). Pt-Si gave small amounts of allyl alcohol and propane (0.4 and 0.6% selectivity, respectively) whereas Pt black produced about 1% propane (Table 3, columns 5 Table 2 Activity and selectivity of MoO3 and WO3 in the hydrogenation of acrolein at 323 K Oxide Pretreatment temperaturea (K) Activityb (mmol ACR/hg) Selectivity (mol%)c S(AL) S(AA) S(OL) MoO3 WO3 323 0 -- -- -- 433 0,2 69 24.1 6.9 573 0.1 0 0 100 673 0.02 0 0 100 773 0 -- -- -- 323 0 -- -- 433 0.07 0 80 573 0.03 0 100 673 0.02 0 100 773 0 -- -- m 20 0 0 aH2 flow, 3 h. bRate of disappearance of acrolein (ACR) per gram of oxide per hour.

This is in agreement with previous works which showed that conventional platinum catalysts are almost exclusively active for C=C bond hydro- genation in acrolein [2] or crotonaldehyde [6]. How- ever, depending on the support used and the pretreatment of catalyst, very low selectivity to allyl alcohol (0-5%) has been observed in the hydrogena- tion of acrolein over conventional catalysts [2]. 3.1.3. Activity and selectivity of Pt-Mo and Pt-W catalysts The activities of Pt-Mo and Pt-W catalysts pre- treated at different temperatures were determined for acrolein hydrogenation at 323 K. Table 4 summarizes the results obtained, together with those reported in Table 3 for conventional platinum catalysts, for the sake of comparison. C. Hoang-Van, O.

Units are molecules per hour per surface Pt atom. The activities, expressed as reaction rates or turn- over frequencies, of both Pt-Mo and Pt-W catalysts increased with increasing pretreatment temperatures in the range 323-673 K but sharply decreased for a pretreatment at 773 K (Table 4, columns 3 and 4). When pretreated between 433 and 673 K, these cata- lysts were more active than the conventional ones (columns 3 and 4). The selectivities to different products in the hydro- genation of acrolein at 323 K over Pt-Mo and Pt-W catalysts pretreated between 323 and 773 K are given in Table 5. For pretreatment temperatures below ca. 573 K, Pt- Mo and Pt-W catalysts quantitatively transformed acrolein into proponal (Table 5, column 3), as it was observed for conventional platinum catalysts (see Table 3). However, as the pretreatment temperature increased from 673 to 773 K, the selectivity to allyl alcohol increased from 4% to 7.7% for Pt-Mo and from 11.8% to 67% for Pt-W (Table 5, column 4). For Pt-Mo and Pt-W, both pretreated at 773 K, propanol was pro- duced with 3.3% and 33% selectivity, respectively (Table 5, last column), in contrast to conventional Table 5 Effect of the catalyst pretreatment temperature on the selectivities of Pt-Mo and Pt-W catalysts in acrolein hydrogenation at 323 K Catalyst Pretreatment Selectivity (tool%)b temperaturea (K) S(AL) S(AA) S(OL) Pt-Mo Pt-W 323 100 0 0 433 100 0 0 573 100 0 0 673 96 4 0 773 89 7.7 3.3 323 100 0 0 433 100 0 0 573 97.1 0 2.9 673 88.2 11.8 0 773 0 67 33 aH2 flow, 3 h. bpropanal (AL), allyl alcohol (AA), propanol (OL). platinum catalysts over which propanol was not formed (Table 3). Also, propane was not detected over Pt-Mo and Pt-W catalysts, irrespective of the pre- treatment temperature whereas small amounts of this product (ca. 1%) were formed over Pt-Si and Pt black (Table 3, last column). Finally, the most unexpected selectivities were observed for the Pt-W catalyst pretreated at 773 K which did not produce propanal but 67% allyl alcohol and 33% propanol (Table 5, last line). For the sake of comparison, Fig. 1 illustrates the effect of the pretreatment temperature on the selectivities to different products in acrolein hydro- genation at 323 K over Pt-Mo and Pt-W catalysts, together with those observed over conventional platinum catalysts. It is conspicuous from this figure that Pt-Mo and Pt-W pretreated below 573 K and conventional pla- tinum catalysts exhibit almost the same selectivity behavior, i.e. nearly 100% selectivity to propanal. For pretreatments from 673 to 773 K, both Pt-Mo and Pt- W show increasing selectivities to allyl alcohol and propanol. No propanal is observed over Pt-W pre- treated at 773 K but very high selectivities to allyl alcohol (67%) and to propanol (33%), which indicates a completely different catalytic behavior of this sample, in comparison with conventional platinum catalysts. 96 C.

By contrast, MoO3 and WO3 pretreated between 323-673 K showed slight activities (Table 6, column 3). Only propanol was produced over MoO3 and WO3 pre- treated at temperatures below 573 K. For a pretreatment at 673 K, both MoO3 and WO3 produced propanal with 39% and 42% selectivity, respectively (Table 6, last column), in addition to propanol. A pretreatement at 773 K prior to reaction led to inactive MoO3 and WO3 oxides. These results were taken into account in the determination of the properties of Pt-Mo and Pt-W catalysts in the hydrogenation of allyl alcohol. 3.2.2. Activity and selectivity of conventional platinum catalysts Shown in Table 7 are the activities and selectivities of Pt-A1, Pt-Si and Pt black catalysts in allyl alcohol hydrogenation. As for acrolein hydrogenation (Table 3), the activ- ity of conventional platinum catalysts in allyl alcohol hydrogenation decreased in the order Pt-Si>Pt- AI>>Pt black (Table 7, columns 2 and 3). Vannice et al. [6] have also reported that a Pt/SiO2 catalyst was three times more active than a Pt/AlzO3 catalyst in the hydrogenation of crotyl alcohol at 353 K. Propanol was always the major product (Table 7, column 4). Propanal was also produced at relatively high selectivities over Pt-A1 and Pt-Si (41% and 30%, respectively, column 5) whereas this isomerization product was not detected over Pt black. The selectivity to propane of these catalysts was very low (1-4%) and decreased in the order: Pt black>Pt-Si>Pt-A1 (Table 7, column 6). The effect of the suppport is particularly showed off by the ratio R of the numbers of moles of propanol and propanal produced (R=S(OL)/S(AL)) that increased from 1.4 for Pt-A1 to 2.2 for Pt-Si and became infinite for Pt black (Table 7, last column). A higher R value was also reported for crotyl alcohol hydrogenation at 353 K over a Pt/SiO2 catalyst, in comparison with that of a Pt/AI203 catalyst [6].

Activity and selectivity of Pt-Mo and Pt-W catalysts The activities of Pt-Mo and Pt-W catalysts in allyl alcohol hydrogenation at 323 K were determined as functions of the catalyst pretreatment temperature. Table 8 shows the results obtained, together with those of conventional catalysts (from Table 7), for the sake of comparison. For both Pt-Mo and Pt-W catalysts, a distinct maximum in the activity was observed for a pretreat- ment temperature of 673 K (Table 8, columns 3 and 4). It is worthwhile to note that Pt-Mo pretreated at 673 K exhibited the highest activity per gram of Pt among all tested catalysts (column 3) whereas Pt-Si showed the highest activity per platinum surface atom (last column). The selectivities to different products in allyl alco- hol hydrogenation at 323 K over Pt-Mo and Pt-W pretreated in the range 323-773 K are summarized in Table 9. For both Pt-Mo and Pt-W catalysts, the selectivity to propanol, S(OL), generally decreased whereas that toward propanal, S(AL), increased (col- umns 3 and 4) as the catalyst pretreatment temperature increased. This entailed a decrease in R values (last column). The evolution of R values for Pt-Mo and Pt- W catalysts pretreated between 323 and 773 K and those of conventional platinum catalysts pretreated at 773 K (Pt-Si and Pt-A1) or at 433 K (Pt black) are illustrated in Fig. 2. It is conspicuous from this figure that the R value distinctly depends on the interaction between the metallic phase and the support.

With the exception of Pt-Mo pretreated at 323 K, the selectivity to propane, S(ANE), decreased as the pretreatment temperature increased for both Pt-Mo and Pt-W catalysts which showed, on the other hand, comparable S(ANE) values (Table 9, column 5). Finally, allene was only observed over Pt-Mo pre- treated below ca. 573 K (Table 9, column 6). 4. Discussion Results reported above clearly show the effects of the pretreatment temperature on the activity and selectivity of Pt-Mo and Pt-W catalysts in the hydro- genations of acrolein and allyl alcohol. These effects can be better understood on the basis of the evolution of the catalyst structure as a function of the pretreat- ment temperature as it has been reported for Pt-Mo and Pt-W catalysts in the first part of this work [1]. 4.1. Acrolein hydrogenation The results concerning acrolein hydrogenation obtained in the present study can be conveniently discussed on the basis of the reactions shown in Scheme 1 for the overall hydrogenation of acrolein to 1-propanol. This scheme includes a series of par- allel and consecutive reactions and also an isomeriza- tion step (reaction 3). It does not comprise steps corresponding to the formation of propane because this product was only detected over Pt-Si and Pt black in very small amounts (<1%) and was absent over the other studied catalysts. Over conventional supported platinum catalysts and Pt black, propanal was produced with 99-100% selec- tivities (Table 3). This result is in agreement with previous works [2,7] and is consistent with the sup- position that the strongest adsorption of a,/3-unsatu- rated aldehydes on Pt will occur via C=C double bonds that are easily hyrogenated on typical Pt catalysts [8], as represented by reaction 1 in Scheme 1. As men- tioned above, very small amounts of propane were detected over Pt black and Pt-Si (1% and 0.6%, respectively) but no propane was found in the presence of Pt-A1 (Table 3). This latter result is in agreement C. Hoang-Van, O.

Hydrogenation of acrolein. with the finding that the occurrence of hydrogenolytic reactions requires large surface ensembles of Pt atoms [9]. Indeed, the average Pt particle diameters deduced from CO chemisorption measurements were 15.8 and 4.1 nm for Pt black and Pt-Si, respectively, whereas that obtained for Pt-A1 was only 1.7 nm [10]. In the presence of Pt-Mo and Pt-W catalysts, the rate of acrolein disappearance increased with increas- ing pretreatment temperature in the range 323-673 K and then sharply declined for 773 K (Table 4). In part I of this work [1], platinum was shown to be finely dispersed on MoO3 and WO3 supports which were transformed into hydrogen bronzes during the course of H2 pretreatment. As the pretreatment temperature increased above ca. 473 K, the bronze supports were partially reduced into lower suboxides (metallic Mo and \"Mo30\" or \"W30\" phases were detected on catalysts pretreated at 773 K) [1]. On diffractograms of a molybdenum hydrogen bronze supported Pt cata- lyst previously outgassed at 433 K, Marcq et al. [11] assigned the presence of some XRD peaks to a mixture of molybdenum suboxides. Jackson et al. [ 12] reported clear evidences, from XPS measurements, of a partial reduction of MoO3 and WO3 for Rh/MoO3 and Rh/ WO3 catalysts having been reduced at 573 K and subsequently used in a test of CO hydrogenation at 448 K. Regalbuto et al. [13] also showed, by XPS measurements, a partial reduction of hydrogen tung- sten bronze supported Pt catalysts reduced at 673 K. They suggested for these catalysts a model of the surface consisting of Pt crystallites decorated by partially reduced WOx species (likely WO2) to explain the suppression of CO chemisorption observed on their catalysts. This model is similar to that proposed for TiO2 supported metal catalysts in the SMSI state, i.e. after a reduction by H2 at high temperature [14]. The SMSI state has also been reported for metals supported on oxides other than TiO2, such as Nb2Os, TazO5 or V203 [15,16], and a direct correlation between the SMSI behavior and the reducibility of the support has been established [15]. Based on the results reported by Hasegawa [ 17] for the reduction of MoO3 and WO3 by H2 and by Reymond et al. [18] for that of TiO2, it can be inferred that MoO3 and WO3 are more reducible than TiO2. This supports the SMSI model proposed by Regalbuto et al. [13] for the Pt/ WO3 system. In light of available results concerning the charac- terization of molybdenum and tungsten hydrogen bronzes supported metal catalysts [1,12,13] and of the above discussion, a representation of the morpho- logical configurations of Pt-Mo and Pt-W systems pretreated at different temperatures is proposed in Scheme 2. For a pretreatment temperature, TpR, below ca. 473 K, the catalyst surface consists of Pt metal par- ticles of varying size deposited on the surface of hydrogen molybdenum or tungsten bronzes (Scheme 2a). For TpR in the range 473-673 K, molyb- denum or tungsten suboxides MOx (M: Mo or W; 2<x<3) are formed [1] at the Pt-support interface and can migrate onto Pt particles, preferentially near the support surface (Scheme 2b). As the pretreatment temperature is further increased from 673 to 773 K, highly reduced suboxides MOy (M: Mo or W; y_<2) [1] form a separate phase from the support and decorate the surface of Pt particles whereas some MOx species can still remain on these systems (Scheme 2c). The representations in Scheme 2 suggest that new active sites are created on the surface of Pt-Mo and Pt-W catalysts as TpR increases above ca. 473 K. They are very likely adlineation Pt-MOx sites for 100 C. Hoang-Van, O. Zegaoui/Applied Catalysis A: General 164 (1997) 91-103 O o~ o~ o) ~ a C Scheme 2.

In acrolein hydrogenation, it was observed that the acrolein disappearance rate increased as TpR increased from 323 to 673 K (Table 4), suggesting that Pt-MOx sites are more active than Pt particles deposited on hydrogen bronze supports. This supposition is in agreement with many previous works that evoked promotional catalytic effects of highly active Pt-WOx or Pt-MoOx adlinea- tion sites as a result of the decoration of Pt particles by tungsten or molybdenum suboxides [ 12,19,20]. How- ever, as TpR increased from 673 to 773 K, the high coverage of Pt particles by MOy species (Scheme 2(c)) should cause a large decrease in the accessibility of different active sites, entailing a distinct decrease in the disappearance rate of acrolein (Table 4). One of the most striking results obtained in this study concerns the selectivities in acrolein hydroge- nation over Pt-Mo and Pt-W catalysts pretreated at different temperatures, For TpR<ca. 573 K, these cat- alysts are almost exclusively active for the hydrogena- tion of the C=C bond of acrolein, which constitutes a selectivity characteristic of conventional platinum catalysts [2,6, and this work]. However, as TpR increased from 673 to 773 K, the selectivity to allyl alcohol increased from 4% to 7.7% and from 11.8% to 67% for Pt-Mo and Pt-W catalysts, respectively (Table 5 and Fig. 1). This means that, in contrast to conventional Pt catalysts, Pt-Mo and Pt-W pretreated at high temperature can activate the C=O bond of acrolein leading to its hydrogenation into allyl alcohol (Scheme 1, reaction 2). The highest selectivity to allyl alcohol (67%) was observed for the Pt-W 773 K- pretreated catalyst which also produced propanol (33%) but no propanal. These results support the hypothesis of particular properties of Pt-MOx and Pt-MOy adlineation sites illustrated in Scheme 2(b) and (c), respectively. Since the selectivity to allyl alcohol increased with TpR increasing from 673 to 773 K, the presence of Pt-MOy sites (with y<2) on highly reduced catalysts should distinctly favor the formation of allyl alcohol with respect to other reac- C. Hoang-Van, O. Zegaoui/Applied Catalysis A: General 164 (1997) 91-103 101 tion products. However, it must be pointed out that Pt- W pretreated at 773 K produced, as mentioned above, no propanal but allyl alcohol (67%) and propanol (33%) whereas Pt-Mo pretreated at the same tem- perature gave propanal (89%), allyl alcohol (7.7%) and propanol (3.3%). This result strongly suggests a very different distribution of the types of active sites (see Scheme 2) over these catalysts pretreated at 773 K. Vannice and Sen [6] have shown that Pt-TiOx sites (with x<2) formed on Pt/TiO2 catalysts prereduced at 773 K were responsible for a marked enhancement in the selectivity toward crotyl alcohol in the hydrogena- tion of crotonaldehyde. They have proposed a model of active sites involving either Ti3+ or Ti2+ cations or oxygen vacancies that coordinate the oxygen atom in the C=O group and activate it for a facile hydrogena- tion by H atoms supplied by the Pt surface [6]. This proposal is supported by the studies of Poltarzewski et al. [7,21] who found that the addition of tin oxide to a Pt/nylon catalyst enhanced the selectivities to allyl and cinnamyl alcohols in the hydrogenations of acrolein and cinnamaldehyde, respectively [7,21]. Marinelli and Ponec [2] also have reported that Pt/SiO2 catalysts modified by tin exhibited a high selectivity to allyl alcohol in acrolein hydrogenation and explained their results by the presence of promoting species such as SnOx bearing a positive charge that strengthens the \"dative\" adsorption of C=O groups. In line with the above results, Richard et al. [22,23] and Goupil et al. [24] have reported an enhancement of the selectivity to cinnamyl alcohol in the hydrogenation of cinna- maldehyde in liquid phase, over Pt/charcoal catalysts promoted with iron. For these Pt-Fe/charcoal cata- lysts, an increase in the electron density of platinum was detected both by XANES [25] and by the change in the relative adsorption coefficients of toluene and benzene [23], probably because there is an electron transfer from iron promoters to platinum atoms. The electron-deficient iron cation (or adatom) can act as an adsorption site for the C=O group of the cinnamalde- hyde molecule via donation of electrons from the oxygen atom, which allows a facile hydrogenation of the thereby activated C=O bond by H atoms adsorbed on neighboring Pt atoms [22,23]. It should be mentioned that high temperature pre- treatment conditions applied to Pt-Mo and Pt-W catalysts favor the creation of Pt-MOx and Pt-MOy adlineation sites by stimulating the SMSI transport of suboxide entities onto Pt particles. If an electron transfer from support cations to Pt atoms is actual [13,29], the electron-deficient character of these cations is increased, which favors the \"dative\" adsorption of C=O groups. To sum up, the enhancement in selective hydro- genation of c~,/3-unsaturated aldehydes over platinum catalysts can be achieved either by addition of transi- tion metal ion promoters (e.g. Snn+, Fen+) or by using reducible oxide supports (TiO2, MOO3, WO3) that allow the creation of special sites at the metal-support interface as a result of high temperature reducing conditions [26]. On these catalytic systems, the high selectivity toward C=O bond hydrogenation in c~,/3- unsaturated aldehydes may be interpreted by a dual- site mechanism whereby C=O groups are adsorbed on electron-deficient species via the oxygen atoms. The C=O bonds thus activated are hydrogenated by H atoms adsorbed on neighboring Pt atoms. 4.2. Allyl alcohol hydrogenation Under the conditions used in this study, the main product in allyl alcohol hydrogenation over Pt black is propanol (96%), with a small fraction of propane (4%). In the presence of a support, large amounts of propanal are also produced by isomerization of allyl alcohol. Allene is produced only over the Pt-Mo catalyst pretreated between 323 and 573 K. Scheme 3 shows the reaction sequences that can lead to different observed products. Results obtained in this study support the supposi- tion that unsupported platinum (Pt black) almost exclusively hydrogenates the C=C double bond of allyl alcohol to propanol (Scheme 3, reaction 1), whereas the isomerization of allylic alcohol into pro- panal (reaction 3) involves the participation of a support. Dupin et al. [27] have reported that the selectivity to propanol in the liquid phase hydrogenation of allyl alcohol over supported Pd catalysts increased with increasing basicity of the support, whereas the iso- merization selectivity to propanal increased with the acidity. Hubaut et al. [28] also have suggested that the hydrogenation of allylic alcohols to saturated alcohols over copper chromite catalysts, in the vapor-phase, took place over copper(I) sites, whereas their isomer- 102 C.

Hydrogenation of allyl alcohol. ization to corresponding aldehydes or ketones was induced by chromium(Ill) cations, whose acidic prop- erties are well known. Vannice et al. [6] have reported that the ratio of hydrogenation to isomerization pro- ducts for crotyl alcohol hydrogenation over a Pt/TiO2 catalyst, previously submitted to a reduction at 773 K, was smaller than that obtained with the same catalyst prereduced at 473 K. This result suggests that the isomerization activity is enhanced in the presence of Pt/TiO2 under SMSI state because of the presence of Pt-TiOx adlineation sites. In our study of allyl alcohol hydrogenation, the ratio R of propanol over propanal products was 1.3 for Pt- A1 and 2.2 for Pt-Si. (Table 7 and Fig. 2), which confirms a higher selectivity to propanal over the more acidic alumina support with respect to silica. For Pt-Mo and Pt-W pretreated below ca. 473 K, the R values lie between 1.3 and 2.8 (Table 9 and Fig. 2), which may reflect the acido-basic character of molyb- denum or tungsten bronze supports, as it has been suggested in the case of conventional oxide supports. Note that allene was produced (Scheme 3, reaction 4) only over the Pt-Mo catalyst pretreated below ca. 573 K (Table 9), which suggests that special dehydra- tion sites are present on the H1.6MoO3 bronze support [1]. The ratio R markedly decreased for Pt-Mo and Pt- W catalysts pretreated in the range 673-773 K. Indeed, the production of propanal over these samples was larger than that of propanol (R~0.9, Table 9 and Fig. 2). This may be interpreted in terms of the presence, on these catalysts pretreated at high tem- perature, of Pt-MOx and Pt-MOy adlineation sites that contain electron-deficient low valence Mo or W cations resulting from an electron transfer from these cations toward Pt [ 13,29]. A similar hypothesis may be advanced for the enhancement in the rate of crotyl alcohol isomerization observed over Pt/TiO2 under the SMSI state [6]. Propane was produced (Scheme 3, reactions 2, 5, 6 and 7) in the presence of all the catalysts studied. Its selectivity was comprised between 1% and 8%, depending on the support (Tables 7 and 9). For Pt black, Pt-Si and Pt-A1, the selectivity to propane decreased (from 4% to 1%, Table 7) while the average diameter of Pt particles decreased from 15 to 1.7 nm [10], which is in agreement with the finding that hydrogenolytic reactions are favored on large ensem- bles of Pt atoms [9]. In the case of Pt-Mo and Pt-W catalysts, the selectivity to propane generally decreased as the pretreatment temperature increased (Table 9). This may be explained by a progressive alteration of platinum sites as a result of an increase in the interaction between Pt and the support when the pretreatment temperature was raised. Indeed, an elec- tron transfer from reduced cations of the support toward Pt atoms during a reduction above 473 K seems probable [13,29]. Finally, the absence of pro- pane in the products of acrolein hydrogenation over Pt-Mo and Pt-W catalysts (Table 5) suggests that the hydrogenolysis of allyl alcohol (Scheme 3, reactions 2 or 4 and 7) is easier than that of propanal (reaction 6) or propanol (reaction 5), as it has already been sug- gested by others [2,30]. In conclusion, the results concerning the Pt/MoO3 and Pt/WO3 systems show that hydrogen molybdenum and tungsten bronzes formed during the H2 pretreat- ment of catalysts at temperatures below 433 K, as C. Hoang-Van, O. Zegaoui/Applied Catalysis A: General 164 (1997) 91-103 103 evidenced in our previous study [1], do not signifi- cantly modify the catalytic properties of supported platinum. However, an increase in the pretreatment temperature from 573 to 773 K very likely leads to the creation of adlineation sites as a result of an associa- tion of platinum atoms and electron-deficient cations of the partially reduced supports. These sites can activate the aldehydic oxygen atom and permit an easy supply of hydrogen atoms, which explains the selectivity to allyl alcohol in acrolein hydrogenation. The presence of electron-deficient cations in these sites also favors the isomerization of allyl alcohol to propanal with respect to its hydrogenation to pro- panol. References [1] C. Hoang-Van, O.

The vapor-phase hydrogenation of acrolein, as a model molecule representing the α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, was studied over Pt powder and Pt dispersed on SiO2, Al2O3 and ultrafine MoO3 and WO3 particles. The hydrogenation and isomerization of allyl alcohol were also investigated to obtain additional information about the effects of the supports and the network of these reactions. In the hydrogenation of acrolein, allyl alcohol was significantly produced only over Pt/MoO3 and Pt/WO3 catalysts previously reduced in the temperature range 673–773 K. This supports the proposal that adlineation sites created at the PtMoO3 and PtWO3 interfaces following a reduction at high temperature are responsible for the activation of carbonyl bonds. Also these adlineation sites, which contain electron-deficient cations resulting from a partial reduction of the oxide support, favor the isomerization of allyl alcohol to propanal at the expense of its hydrogenation to propanol. By contrast, for prereduction temperatures below ca. 573 K, the catalytic behavior of Pt/MoO3 and Pt/WO3 in the two reaction tests was not distinctly different from that of conventional Pt catalysts, which suggests that the molybdenum and tungsten hydrogen bronze supports do not markedly influence the catalytic properties of Pt catalysts.

        "dc:description": "The vapor-phase hydrogenation of acrolein, as a model molecule representing the α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, was studied over Pt powder and Pt dispersed on SiO2, Al2O3 and ultrafine MoO3 and WO3 particles. The hydrogenation and isomerization of allyl alcohol were also investigated to obtain additional information about the effects of the supports and the network of these reactions. In the hydrogenation of acrolein, allyl alcohol was significantly produced only over Pt/MoO3 and Pt/WO3 catalysts previously reduced in the temperature range 673–773 K. This supports the proposal that adlineation sites created at the PtMoO3 and PtWO3 interfaces following a reduction at high temperature are responsible for the activation of carbonyl bonds. Also these adlineation sites, which contain electron-deficient cations resulting from a partial reduction of the oxide support, favor the isomerization of allyl alcohol to propanal at the expense of its hydrogenation to propanol. By contrast, for prereduction temperatures below ca. 573 K, the catalytic behavior of Pt/MoO3 and Pt/WO3 in the two reaction tests was not distinctly different from that of conventional Pt catalysts, which suggests that the molybdenum and tungsten hydrogen bronze supports do not markedly influence the catalytic properties of Pt catalysts.",
