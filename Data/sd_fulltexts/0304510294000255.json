Mg0-Pt catalyst could be recycled in the oxidation without noticeable decrease of its activity. Further investigation of MgOPt and S'02 -Pt by TEM and XPS showed that lower valent (mainly Pt(0)), smaller, and more homogeneously dispersed platinum particles tended to form on MgO than on Si0z. This indicated that the oxide in the oxide-Pt catalysts played an important role in controlling the dispersion and valence of platinum, consequently strongly influencing the activity of oxide-Pt catalysts.

Introduction Oxidation catalysts are of interest especially when the overall oxidizing agent is oxygen [ 1-3] . An important goal in this area of research has been to develop recycleable catalyst systems for mild and selective oxidation of hydrocarbons. Supported metal catalysts are expected to be such catalysts [ 4,5 ] . But very few such examples of the oxidation catalysts are available [ 6 ] . Silica-supported platinum and silica-supported polymer platinum complex catalysts [7,8] are active in the oxidation of alcohols having 1-3 carbons, but less active and sometimes almost inactive towards the long-chain alcohols having more than four carbons.

All rights reserved SSDI0304-5102(94)00025-Q 140 C.-G. Jia /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 139-147 Recently, we found that the oxide supports in supported platinum catalysts strongly influenced the activity of the catalysts in the oxidation of alcohols. Alkaline earth oxides including MgO, CaO and BaO could promote the oxidation, and the basic oxide-platinum catalysts displayed high activity in the oxidation of 1-butanol, 1-hexanol, cyclohexanol and cyclopentanol: H ~C + OZ -cat. - /C=O \\ OH In contrast, neutral oxides including Si02 and A1203 supported platinum catalysts prepared by a similar method exhibited very low activity in the oxidation. From TEM and XPS analyses, it was found that the oxide supports greatly affected the dispersion and valence of the platinum in the oxide-platinum catalysts, lower valent (mainly zerovalent, catalytically active), smaller and more homogeneously dispersed platinum particles tended to be present on MgO than on Si02. The support effects gave us a great inspiration in the design of the supported metal catalyst. 2. Experimental 2.1. Instrumentation XPS data were recorded on the PHI 5300 ESCA system (Perkin-Elmer) using an aluminum cathode (1486.6 eV) as the X-ray source, and the system energy calibration was based on the binding energy of the adventitious carbon (284.6 eV). Transmission electron microscopic analyses (TEM) were performed on a Hitachi H-800 instrument. The oxidation products were analyzed on a Shanghai 103 gas chromatography instrument using 2 m steel column which was packed with PEG-6000 on GDX-101 (80-100 mesh). The products were identified by comparison with authentic samples and further confirmed by GC-MS coupling (GC: HP-5890; MS: 5988). 2.2. Materials Si02 (pyrogenic silica, 370 M2 /g, 300 mesh), Mg0 (120 m2/g, <300 mesh), A1203 (y-alumina, 225 m2/g), Ca0 ( < 300 mesh) and Ba0 ( < 300 mesh) were commercial products, they were heated at 200 C under reduced pressure prior to use. Alcohols and diethyl carbonate were AR grade and used without further purification. 2.3. Preparation of oxide-supported platinum catalysts A typical example was given for the preparation of the MgO-Pt catalyst containing 0.5 mmol Pt/g-cat. as follows: Under nitrogen atmosphere, HZPtCIb (0.55 mmol) in ethanol (15 ml) was refluxed with Mg0 (1.0 g) for 8 h. The reaction solution became colourless when stirring was stopped. This indicated that all platinum ions in the solution were anchored to the support. After filtration, the grey powder thus obtained was washed with ethanol C.-G. Jia /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 139-147 141 several times and dried at 60 C under reduced pressure for 12 h. Finally, MgO-Pt (1.1 g) was obtained, the content of platinum measured by the atomic absorption spectrophotometer was in good agreement with that calculated. Other oxide-platinum catalysts were prepared similarly. 2.4. General procedure for the oxidation of alcohols The oxidation was carried out under an atmospheric pressure of oxygen. Alcohol (10 mmol), the supported platinum catalyst (total platinum content, 0.1 mmol) and solvent (4 ml) were added to a 25 ml round bottom flask fitted with a reflux condenser (connected to an oxygen burette) and a magnetic stirrer. The reaction was started by purging the solution with Oz for 2 min. The mixture was stirred vigorously to keep the catalyst completely suspended in the solution. The reaction flask was placed in a constant temperature bath ( 2 C), and the reaction was monitored according to the uptake of oxygen and detected by GC through drawing a small amount of the reaction liquid with a syringe at regular intervals. The recycle of a catalyst was investigated in the following way: after the catalyst was used in the reaction, it was filtered out and washed several times, then re-added to the reaction system together with an alcohol and the solvent. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Preparation and characterization The oxide-Pt catalysts were prepared by reduction of Pt(IV) with ethanol in reflux: reflux H2 PtClb + CZ HS OH + oxide-------). oxide-Pt + CH3 CHO + CH3 COOH + HCl (platinum in low valence) The colour of the oxide-Pt catalysts was grey, and it was noticed that in the course of the catalyst preparation, the time required for the colour change of the oxides from white to grey was different owing to the different oxides. The time for MgO, CaO and BaO was about 15 min, while that for Si02 and A1203 was about 1 h, and that for acidic A1203 was about 15 h. This indicated that the platinum was easily reduced on to the surface of basic oxides, and scarcely on to the surface of acidic oxides. This is similar to the reported results that the formation of low valent metal species and metal hydrides was promoted by a base [1]. Considering the activity of the oxide-Pt catalysts, MgO-Pt and Si02-Pt containing 0.5 mmol/g prepared by the same method were analyzed by TEM and XPS. The XPS data are given in Table 1. Low valent platinum species, Pt (O) 69.9%, BE< 7 1.0 eV and Pt (11) 30.1 %, BE = 72.4 eV were found in MgO-Pt; but zerovalent platinum was scarcely found in Si02-Pt, only Pt(II) 58.6%, BE= 72.2 eV was found together with unreduced Pt(IV) 41.4%, BE= 75.3 eV. This indicated that the low valent platinum species tended to form on basic MgO in comparison with neutral Si02. These results are in good agreement with the observation in the course of the catalyst preparation. 142 C.-G. Jia /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 139-147 Fig. 1. Transmission electron micrograph of Mg0-Pt, (a) magnification 100,000, (b) magnification 4 X 100,000. Carbon species (BE, 284.6 eV) were also noticed on both Mg0-Pt and Si02-Pt; but high valent carbon species (BE, 288.5 eV) were found on Mg0-Pt, presumably the carbon in carboxyl groups. This implied that basic MgO promoted the oxidation of ethanol to acetic acid in the preparation of Mg0-Pt. Morphology of the platinum in Mg0-Pt and SiO2-Pt was examined by TEM. It was found that small platinum particles (20-45 A, mainly 27 A) almost homogeneously dispersed on MgO, while very large platinum particles (50-200 A, mainly 125 A) heteroge- C.-G.

The shape of Pt particles on MgO support was not globular, but nearly hemispherical, which reflected the strong affinity between Pt and MgO. The particle size of the platinum on MgO was in the range of platinum clusters [ 11 ] . All these results mean that the property of the oxides determines the dispersion and valent 144 C.-G. Jia /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 139-147 state of the platinum in the oxide-Pt catalysts, and would thus affect their catalytic activity in catalysis. It is well known that alkaline earth oxides (highly ionic oxides, Mz+02-) incorporate transition metal species as ions in solid solution, they serve a function beyond that of controlling the oxidation state and the coordination symmetry of the transition metal ions, their surface also acts as a reservoir for charged absorbates diffusing between oxidizing and reducing solute centers [9,10]. The formation process of the small platinum particles on MgO may be described as follows: In the initial period, some platinum species (mainly Pt(IV), possibly including some reduced species) were accommodated in solid solution, notably MgO acted as a solid solvent and Mg\" ions were partially replaced by platinum species; some of these platinum species on MgO were reduced as the reaction proceeded, while some platinum species in ethanol solution were being reduced and aggregated with some of the reduced platinum species on MgO, and some platinum species in ethanol were being incorporated into Mg0 just as in the initial reaction period. The aggregation between reduced platinum species and unreduced species, between reduced species themselves and between unreduced species themselves on MgO was also possible. Consequently, the reduction and aggregations led to the formation of the platinum particles on MgO, the dispersion and particle size of platinum was mainly determined by the formation of the solid solution between Platinum species and MgO, and by the intrinsic property of MgO. On the other hand, Si02 cannot form solid solution with platinum species. Therefore, the platinum particles are heterogeneously dispersed. 3.2. Catalytic activity The catalytic activity of the oxide-Pt catalysts was investigated in the oxidation of alcohols under an atmospheric pressure of oxygen (Tables 2-4).

Alkaline earth oxide (MgO, CaO, Ba0)-platinum catalysts displayed higher activity than the neutral oxide ( Si02, A1203)-platinum catalysts under the same conditions when all the catalysts contained the same content of platinum. This agreed with the results that the lower valent, smaller and more homogeneously dispersed platinum particles tended to form on alkaline earth oxides like MgO than on the neutral oxides like Si02, because it is well known that the catalytically active species in this kind of oxidation are zerovalent small platinum particles [ 7 ] .

Jia /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 139-147 bases, alkaline earth oxides was supposed to facilitate the oxidation because the presence of a base could lower the potential difference between reduced and unreduced metal species, and consequently promoted the reverse change of the metal valences which played an important role in catalysis [ 15 ] . For example, the presence of bases promoted the formation of low valent platinum hydrides from tetravalent platinum compounds in ethanol (ethanol also acted as the reducing agent) under nitrogen atmosphere, consequently promoted the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde [ 1 ] . It was also possible that the basic oxide supports increased the electron density of the platinum centers in oxide-Pt catalysts so as to promote the oxidative addition of oxygen to platinum [ 1,14], finally increased the activity of the catalysts. The zerovalent platinum species may also be present in SiO,- Pt and A1203-Pt, but their activity was lowered because of the large particles and heterogeneous dispersion. In the oxidation of primary alcohols such as butanol and hexanol catalyzed by Mg0-Pt (Table 2), the main products were the corresponding carboxylic acids. The oxidation did not stop at the stage of aldehydes presumedly because of the presence of the basic MgO. It was also found that the appropriate amount of platinum in Mg0-Pt was required for the highest activity in the oxidation of cyclohexanol and cyclopentanol when the total mole of platinum added was the same (Table 3) . It was very interesting that Mg0-Pt, Ca0-Pt and BaO-Pt catalysts exhibited higher activity in water than in DEC and n-heptane, though the supports MgO, CaO and BaO were hydroxylated completely and dissolved slightly in water (Table 4). Si02-Pt catalyst still displayed very low activity even in aqueous NaOH solution (Table 4). This implies that the intrinsic bacisity of solid bases MgO, CaO and CaO facilitated the reaction rather than the action of the dissolved bases like Mg(OH) 2, Ca(OH) 2 and Ba(OH) Z. Notably, a neutral aqueous solution was obtained after Ba0-Pt was used in the oxidation. The catalyst Mg0Pt could be recycled in the oxidation of cyclopentanol and cyclohexanol without decrease of its activity. This shows the advantage of the supported catalysts (Table 4). To sum up, the oxide supports in oxide-Pt catalysts played an important role in controlling the dispersion and valence of the platinum, consequently strongly influenced the activity of the catalysts. Highly dispersed platinum catalyst, Mg0-Pt exhibited high activity in the oxidation of alcohols, it can be recycled without noticeable decrease of its activity. The alkaline earth oxides and other basic supports for the platinum catalysts offer the promise for the oxidation of other alcohols and organic substrates. Further studies are in progress.
