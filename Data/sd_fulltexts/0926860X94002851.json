Netherlands Received 18 November 1994; accepted 9 December 1994 Abstract The heterogeneous selective liquid-phase oxidation of aldonic acids to the corresponding 2-keto- acids over a lead- or bismuth-modified platinum catalyst was reinvestigated. The influence of the pH (pH range 2-9) on the nature and the stability of the chelate complex formed between aldonic acid and the promotor (Pb, Bi), which is assumed to govern the selectivity, was found to be important for the performance of the catalyst. The non-selective complexation in alkaline medium of the promotor with 2-keto-aldonic acid was assumed to be the cause of the decrease of the selectivity at higher conversion. In weakly acidic medium (pH < 6) when poisoning of the catalyst was avoided over 98% selectivity at over 98% conversion was achieved.

Introduction The use of supported noble metal catalysts for the oxidation of carbohydrates by oxygen is a well-studied reaction. The first example was reported by Von Gorup- Besanz in 1861 who oxidized mannose using platinum black as the catalyst [ 1 ]. Heyns et al. [ 24] have studied extensively the catalytic oxidation of carbohydrates using, in particular, platinum on carbon as the catalyst. Other noble metal catalysts were studied by other research groups. Some selectivity rules were proposed. Palladium was found to be superior in the selective oxidation of aldoses to aldonic acids [5,6] ; on the other hand supported platinum was the catalyst of choice for the oxidation of primary hydroxyl groups in carbohydrates [7,8]. Recently, bime- * Corresponding author. 0926-860X/95/$09.50 1995 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved SSDIO926-860X( 94 )00285- 1 410 A. A bbadi, 14. van Bekkum / Applied Catalysis A: General 124 (1995) 409-417 tallic catalysts were developed for the oxidation of carbohydrates. Thus bismuth- promoted palladium showed increased activity in glucose oxidation [ 9-12]. The presence of the promotor seemed to suppress the poisoning of the catalyst and theoretical conversion was achieved with high selectivity toward gluconic acid. On the other hand, the promotor changes the selectivity of the platinum catalyst pro- foundly. The oxidation of aldonic acids with platinum supported on carbon and modified by lead or bismuth yields 2-keto-aldonic acids [ 13-15 ]. It seems that the presence of the promotor generates a new selectivity towards the oxidation of the secondary hydroxyl group at the a-position of the carboxyl function, while unmo- dified platinum catalyst exhibited selectivity toward the oxidation of the primary hydroxyl group at the 6-position of the aldonic acid [ 16]. The studies performed with this catalyst (Pb/Pt/C) during the oxidation of aldonic acids were carried out in weakly alkaline medium (pH = 8) and showed a high initial selectivity toward 2-keto-aldonic acids, but rapid degradation of the reaction product took place at higher conversion [ 13-15]. We were interested in studying the behavior of this catalyst in order to understand the cause of the decrease of the selectivity during the oxidation reaction. For this purpose we have investigated the influence of the pH of the reaction mixture on the selectivity of the bimetallic catalyst. The results of these studies are reported here. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials D-gluconic, D-arabinonic and D-ribonic acids were purchased from Merck and were used without further purification. Sodium 2-keto-gluconate was obtained from Sigma. The 5% Bi/5% Pt/C (platinum dispersion 0.24) was provided generously by Degussa, while 5 % Pb/5% Pt/C was prepared according to the literature [ 13 ]. 2.2. Oxidation equipment Experiments were performed in a thermostatted glass batch reactor of 300 ml, equipped with a glass gas-tight stirrer (1500 rpm). The pH was kept constant, when necessary, by using a pH meter (Metrohm 654) coupled to a pH control unit (Metrohm 614) and an automatic burette (Metrohm 655, l0 ml piston) containing 1.60 M KOH. The oxygen partial pressure of the gas phase could be adjusted to any desired value between 0.05 and 1 atm, and was kept constant during the reaction using an automatic oxygen supply system. This system consisted of a motor burette filled with water as displacing liquid, a thermostatted (30) gas burette filled with oxygen, and a differential pressure sensor, which operated the motor burette. Oxy- gen and hydroxide uptakes were recorded during the reactions. Details related to the oxidation equipment were reported elsewhere [ 17]. A. Abbadi, H. van Bekkum / Applied Catalysis A: General 124 (1995) 409-417 411 2.3. Oxidation procedure Reduction of the catalyst A desired amount of powdered catalyst (0.5 g) was first introduced into the reactor, 50 ml of water was added and the system was flushed with nitrogen for 5 min to remove oxygen from the reactor. Then hydrogen was bubbled through the reactor for 5 min at a high flow-rate and low stirring speed, and then for 25 min at a low flow-rate and high stirring speed. Finally, the hydrogen was removed from the gas phase by flushing with nitrogen for 5 rain. Starting up of the reaction A defined amount of the substrate (4 mmol aldonic acid) was dissolved in 30 ml of water and the solution was added to the suspended reduced catalyst under low nitrogen flow. The system was equilibrated at the preset temperature, and the desired oxygen partial pressure was adjusted by sucking a calculated amount of gas out of the reactor, the gas being automatically replaced by pure oxygen. The reaction started immediately. The reaction was monitored by taking samples at suitable intervals of time and analyzing these by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). 2.4. HPLC analysis The samples were analyzed using a Dionex CarboPac PA 1 column, with a Dionex PED 1 pulsed electrochemical detector containing a gold electrode to which poten- tials of E~ 0.1, E2 0.6, and E3 - 0.8 V were applied for duration times TI 0.5, T2 0.09, and T3 0.07 s. Two Waters M6000-A HPLC pumps, coupled to a Waters M680 gradient controller were used to adjust the required solvent gradient. NaOH and anhydrous NaOAc were used to prepare eluents in water, which was filtered and degassed with helium prior to the addition of these compounds. All solvents were stored in closed, pressurized vessels with helium splashing. Compositions of solvents A and B were as follows: solvent A = 0.1 M NaOH, solvent B = 0.1 M NaOH and 0.5 M NaOAc. The flow-rate was set at 1 ml/min. The gradient used for the analysis was as follows: 100% solvent A was used for 10 min followed by a linear gradient to reach the eluent composition of 60% A and 40% B in 10 min. This composition was maintained for 10 min, then the eluent was returned to 100% A in 5 min following a linear gradient. The chromatographic data were processed using a Spectra Physics SP4270 integrator. Also, a Phenomenex Rezex organic acid column (60, eluent 0.01 M aqueous trifluoroacetic acid at 0.6 ml/min) was used to estimate the concentration of degradation products. 3. Results and discussion The oxidation of aldonic acids to 2-keto-aldonic acids was carried out with gluconic acid as the model compound. 5% Bi/5% Pt/C and 5% Pb/5% Pt/C were 412 A.

The oxidation reaction was performed in weakly alkaline medium ( pH = 8, constant) as well as in acidic medium ( without pH control of the reaction ) to estimate the pH effect on the selectivity of the catalyst. In the latter case the starting situation was the free gluconic acid (pH=2.8) or sodium gluconate (pH = 6). 3.1. Oxidation reaction at pH 8 The evolution of the oxidation reaction of gluconic acid over the Pt-Bi catalyst at pH 8 is presented in Fig. 1. The pH of the reaction was kept constant by automatic continuous addition of 1.6 M KOH. Under these conditions, the catalyst exhibited high initial selectivity toward 2-keto-gluconic acid. As the oxidation progressed, the catalyst lost its selectivity and consecutive degradation of 2-keto-gluconic acid became pronounced. The main degradation product detected by HPLC was oxalic acid. The maximum yield of 2-keto-gluconic acid amounted to 60% and was reached after 1 h reaction time. The selectivity of the catalyst at this point was 70%. 3.2. Oxidation of gluconic acid without pH control The same oxidation experiment as described above was performed under acidic conditions. Free gluconic acid was used as the starting material and the oxidation was carried out without pH control of the reaction mixture. The course of the oxidation reaction over the Pt-Bi catalyst is presented in Fig. 2. The initial pH of the reaction mixture was 2.8 and it decreased to reach 2.3 at the end of the reaction.

On the other hand, the catalyst exhibited good initial selectivity up to a yield of 2- keto-gluconic acid of 50%. Then catalytic activity as well as selectivity started to decrease and oxalic acid was slowly formed. Apparently, poisoning of the catalyst took place under these conditions. According to our previous work concerning the poisoning of noble metal cata- lysts in acidic medium [ 18,19], we assume that 2-keto-gluconic acid is responsible for the decline of the catalyst performance. The free carboxyl group of 2-keto- gluconic acid is probably involved in a strong interaction with the platinum active sites of the catalyst. Such a strong adsorption will lead to further oxidation of 2- keto-gluconic acid and consequently to a decrease of the activity and the selectivity of the catalyst. However, in the case of gluconic acid, such interaction is weakened since the free carboxyl group participates beside the a-hydroxyl in the formation of a chelate complex with the promotor (Bi); and consequently poisoning of the catalyst by gluconic acid is suppressed [ 19]. The above results led us to apply sodium gluconate in the starting formulation and keeping carboxyl groups ionized. 3.3. Oxidation of sodium gluconate without pH control of the reaction The oxidation of sodium gluconate was performed without pH control of the reaction (Fig. 3). Complete oxidation was achieved within 70 rain with high selectivity. The pH of the reaction varied from 6 initially to reach 4.4 at the end of the oxidation. The catalyst exhibited a constant selectivity (> 98%) during the 414 A.

At the end of the oxidation just traces of oxalic acid were detected ( < 1%). The rapid complete oxidation of sodium gluconate without pH control of the reaction confirmed that the free carboxyl group of 2-keto-gluconic acid can be held responsible for the decrease in the activity of the catalyst in the previous experiment. Apparently, neutralization of the carboxyl group eliminates the poisoning of the catalyst. The use of the Pt-Pb catalyst for the oxidation of sodium gluconate without pH control of the reaction led to the same results (Fig. 4). On the other hand, in weakly alkaline medium (pH 8 ) this catalyst exhibited the same failure as the Pt-Bi catalyst in losing its selectivity toward 2-keto-gluconic acid as the conversion of gluconic acid progressed ( > 80%) [ 13-15]. The effect of the pH on the selectivity of the Pt-Bi catalyst toward 2-keto- gluconic acid is summarized in Fig. 5. The initial selectivity was not influenced by the pH of the reaction mixture. However, under weakly alkaline conditions the catalyst loses its selectivity as the oxidation process progressed without being poisoned. Since the selectivity of the oxidation reaction is thought to originate from the formation of a chelate complex between the promotor (Bi or Pb) and gluconic acid [ 15], the structure and the stability of this complex at different pH values is of major importance for the performance of the catalyst. Indeed, studies on metal- gluconate complexes pointed out that the structure and the stability of such com- plexes are pH dependent [20--22]. Lead was found to be involved in the pH range 1 to 6 in a 1:1 complex with gluconic acid. The carboxyl group and the a-hydroxyl group of gluconic acid serve as coordination center (Scheme 1 ). However, under alkaline conditions, other hydroxyl groups (/3,7) can act as coordination center. A.

Hypothetical structure of non-selective complexation involving the carboxyl, hydrated keto and fl hydroxyl groups of 2-keto-gluconic acid with lead. Recently, the crystalline structure of a 16:2 lead y-cyclodextrin complex was reported in which the hydroxyl groups at the 2- and 3-position of the pyranose ring were involved in the complex formation [ 23 ]. On the other hand, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies showed that a 3:2 lead gluconate complex was formed under alkaline conditions and bismuth was also involved in coordination with other hydroxyl groups of gluconic acid [ 21 ]. In our case, because of geometric hindrance at the surface of the oxidation catalyst, complexes involving more than one glu- conate are unlikely. From these studies we can assume that the essentially theoretical selectivity toward 2-keto-gluconic acid realized with Pt-Bi or Pt-Pb catalysts under acidic conditions (pH < 6), when poisoning of the catalysts was avoided, is probably due to selective complexation of the promotor with the carboxyl and a-hydroxyl group of gluconic acid (Scheme 1 ). Under these conditions of pH, complex formation between the promotor and other hydroxyl groups of gluconic acid or 2-keto-glu- conic acid does not occur. However, in alkaline medium the promotor is probably able to coordinate biden- tately with other (e.g. the 3,4-) hydroxyl groups of gluconic acid and/or of 2-keto- gluconic acid. Such non-selective complexation leads to activation of these coordination centers toward oxidation. The resulting products are not stable and are oxidatively degraded. In Scheme 2 are presented hypothetical structures were 2-keto-gluconic acid is involved in a complex formation with the promotor (Pb). The acid is present in solution in cyclic forms (pyranose--80%, furanose ~ 20% [24] ). The hydrated keto group and the r-hydroxyl, besides the carboxyl group, can serve as coordi- nation center. The/3-furanose as well as the tc4 fl-pyranose are favorable config- urations for the formation of such a complex, which will lead to the activation of the r-position and consecutive degradation of 2-keto-gluconic acid. The oxidations of other aldonates such as arabinonate and ribonate was performed with 5% Bi 5% Pt/C as catalyst and under the optimal conditions described above (without pH control of the reaction). The selectivity of the oxidation process was comparable to that of sodium gluconate. 2-Keto-arabinonate as well as 2-keto- ribonate were obtained with high selectivity and complete conversion of the cor- responding aldonate.

Conclusion This study points out the importance of the pH of the reaction mixture during the selective oxidation of aldonic acids to their 2-keto-aldonic acids. The loss of the selectivity of the catalyst under weakly alkaline conditions is assumed to be due to non-selective glycolic interaction between the promotor and aldonic acids/ 2-keto-aldonic acids leading to C3 oxidation. The complex formation involving the carboxyl and the a-hydroxyl group of aldonic acids is considered to be at the origin of the selectivity. In acidic medium when the conditions are tuned to avoid poison- ing of the catalyst, almost theoretical conversion and selectivity were achieved.

The influence of the pH (pH range 2–9) on the nature and the stability of the chelate complex formed between aldonic acid and the promotor (Pb, Bi), which is assumed to govern the selectivity, was found to be important for the performance of the catalyst. The non-selective complexation in alkaline medium of the promotor with 2-keto-aldonic acid was assumed to be the cause of the decrease of the selectivity at higher conversion. In weakly acidic medium (pH < 6) when poisoning of the catalyst was avoided over 98% selectivity at over 98% conversion was achieved.",
