These constants are compared to each other and with relation to data for inorganic microheterogeneous preparations catalyzing the formation of hydrogen. Introduction Research on hydrogenases and their catalytic activities [1,2] has become of increased interest. A few years ago the possible use of enzymes in water photolysis [2, 3] and in other light-coupled syntheses such as CO^ fixation [4], with the help of suitable multicomponent systems containing catalysts, was envisaged [5-7]. In addition to studies on naturally occur- ring hydrogenases and nitrogenases (also known to be capable of water reduction), work has been done on the synthesis of organic catalysts mimick- ing the active site (an Fe S centre) of hydrogenases [8, 9]. Some enzymes have also been used in the form of whole cell cultures to produce hydrogen under illumination [10]. In an entirely different approach colloidal noble metal suspensions have been examined for the liberation of hydrogen from water in the presence of a reduced relay with appropriate thermodynamic driving force [7]. When employing these catalysts (enzymes, colloids) in hydrogen- producing systems, the question as to their activity arises; i.e., it is desired to clarify whether hydrogenases are 'better' hydrogen catalysts than metal colloids or vice versa. There is no simple answer to this question, which seems to be too naively formulated. For evaluation the catalysts must be compared after proper standardization. Such standardization and compari- sons have never been carried out, and it is one of the main aims of this article to show that this is both desirable and feasible. *Present address: Institut fur Theoretische Chemie und Strahlenchemie, Universitat Wien, Wahringerstr. 38, A-1090 Vienna, Austria. 0304-6102/86/$3.60 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 268 There are at least the following difficulties involved in making reason- able comparisons: (i) Lack of standardization of reported results. In the literature, catalyt- ic activities have been expressed in different ways: for enzymes, in Jul H; evolved per hour, mol s~1 g~1, ml of H; evolved per ml of preparation, units per gram protein, etc. Sometimes only the rate of product formation at substrate saturation is provided, though experiments have often been carried out without that indication. For colloidal metal suspensions, the activity is usually quoted as an apparent first-order rate constant as obtained by kinetic spectroscopy. (ii) Various methods have been designed to measure catalytic activity, and conflicting results have sometimes been reported. (For a critical com- parison of these methods see [11].) This is due to the fact that under the conditions typical for the respective method, data have been obtained for different limiting cases or intermediary regimes in the kinetic rate expres- sions (which are not the same for enzymes and dispersed metal particles) and results have not always been interpreted accordingly. We think that a proper comparison of literature values of catalytic activities should be made on the basis of rate constants; not rates, which are variable due to the particular experimental conditions. In the present work, the standardization procedure used for comparing the activities of catalysts reacting with a reduced relay and water to form hydrogen is done by referring to the following two reaction mechanisms: (i) For enzymatic reactions following Michaelis-Menten kinetics, formation rates are proportional to the concentration of enzyme. The catalytic activity is determined by the maximal rate, fmax) ^d 2 \"m. For concentrations of the reduced form of the relay [R~] < Kyi, the rate linearly increases with [R~]. In this case, if enzyme concentration is expressed in moles per liter, a bimolecular rate constant, k^ (M~1 s~1) can be calculated which equals Uniax/^ml^zv1110])- (ii) To explain the function of a particulate electronically conducting catalyst, the 'microelectrode model' of the particles as derived from cor- rosion theory is used [12-15]. According to this model the formation rate, v, of the product equals isc/F, where igc is the short circuit current through an electron-conducting microsphere and is given by the intersection of the cathodic and anodic current-potential (i-E) curves. For a water reduction catalyst, these curves correspond to hydrogen formation and oxidation of the reduced relay, respectively. Maximal rates will be estab- lished if the intersection of the relay lies on the plateau of its i-E curve (diffusion control). The rate constant, ki(s~1) is then isc/(F[^~])- By division with the molar particle concentration k^ (M~1 s~1) can be obtained. No saturation behavior is observed. If the intersection does not occur on the plateau, fgc and hence v will be dependent on the degree of conversion of R to R~, which itself depends on the production rate, VQ, [R], and other kinetic parameters of a particular experiment [15]. For a more detailed treatment the reader should consult the references given above. 269 Results and discussion Activity As was stated in the Introduction, the aim of the standardization pro- cedure was to calculate from literature values second-order rate constants, &2, or at least first-order apparent rate constants fei (s~1) for a particular preparation. For enzymatic catalysts this calculation of activity is based on the region of initial proportional increase in product formation rate with substrate concentration. Rate constants obtained from this initial slope should thus be understood as maximal (limiting) rate constants. The original- ly reported values in most enzyme works are formation rates from which we tried to calculate rate constants with the help of additional information about the experiments, such as weight of catalyst or volume of reaction mixture. In all cases where only i;niax was given for enzymes and not also Km, it was not possible to calculate either fei or hence fe;. Apart from a few exceptions, such references were omitted from Table 1 (below). Rates are expressed in moles of transferred electrons per liter per second (=2 X mol H;). fei was calculated in the following way: (i) if i;max and .Km hsd been measured: ki=[112}v^/K^, ([R-]<K,J (1) where v is in M s~1; the so calculated constant is valid for concentrations of the reduced relay smaller than K^- (ii) if the measurement had been carried out in the region of propor- tionality between rate and substrate concentration, and [R~] is known: k i = vj [R~ ], k i' = spec. activity/ [R~ ] (2) where 'spec. activity' is in moles of transferred electrons s~1 (g cat/I)\"\"1. (iii) for colloidal (noble) metal catalysts, fei was sometimes directly obtained from the literature. For enzymes, rates of rather high (typically millimolar) substrate concentrations are often quoted but without indication whether saturation was obtained. In such cases Table 1 (below) lists lower limits of rate con- stants as obtained by applying eqn. 2 (in cases where [R~] was given). The calculation of k-^ requires, in addition, the knowledge of the molar concentration of the catalyst, and thus the determination of the molar weight of the freely diffusing species (for colloids the aggregation number or the particle size). fe; = k i/ [catalyst] = fei' MW (3) In many references, the observed rates were not given with respect to volume of reaction mixture or weight of protein, so that unfortunately no comparisons could be made. Table 1 summarizes data for several hydrogenases where enough ex- perimental details were available in the references to calculate rate constants, and data for some colloidal catalysts.

Due to its simplicity and nonspecificity (see below), MV\"1\" thus represents a convenient reference, especially if application of the catalyst in an artificial hydrogen evolving system is envisaged. The rate constants fe, are typical for particular catalyst preparations, thus comprising activity and amount of catalyst per unit volume. For all practical purposes they are the meaningful values, since the formation rate of [1/2]H2 is simply the product of ki and [R~]. From the list of data, it seems that among the enzymes (4 X lO\"4 s-l<fel<5 s~1) the hydrogenases from Megasphera elsdenii and Desulfovibrio vulgaris are the most active prepara- tions reported, not only because of high concentration but also in terms of rate constants fei' in s^^g catalyst 1~1) and fe;. Because of the considerably higher molecular weights of the colloidal inorganic catalysts, their rate constants ^2 are higher compared to enzymes having a similar fe/. k^ values of enzymes (2X104-4X107 M~1 s\"1) show much less scatter than the originally reported formation rates (10~7 -10~3 M s~1) which underlines the usefulness of the calculations made here. A second group of rate constants, for colloidal catalysts, comprises fei values up to 80 times higher than those for the most active enzymatic preparation, ft; values increase up to the diffusion-limited rate constant as calculated by Smoluchowski's formula, (&2= 4?r^A-Dreiay particle /1000) mainly because of the immense particle radius, the determination of which is certainly the limiting factor for the accuracy of derived values, especially when the preparations are poly- disperse. Selectivity The performance of any catalyst may be discussed in terms of activity (&2> see above) and specificity for the substrate (k^relay^/k^relay^)) and the cosubstrate. Obviously, for both enzymes and colloidal metals, reasonable rates can only be observed for reactions with enough thermodynamic driving force; i.e., the redox potential of the reducing species has to be more negative than E^H^/H^). Apart from that, a metallic particle acting as an electron pool does not discriminate between relay substances of different redox potentials under diffusion control (fall-off of rates on such particles occurs only due to poor intersection of anodic and cathodic i-E curves as mentioned above). In contrast, the active sites of enzymes contain a redox species itself, so that the driving force for electron flow from the reduced relay to the enzyme, and not only to the ultimate acceptor (water), must be taken into consideration. Observed activities therefore change for relays of different redox potentials [16]. Data of redox potentials of enzymes (and of the Nemst potential of the solution used for the assay) are often not given, so that the accumulated data (Table 1) should be taken as a rough indication for the classification of hydrogenases by their activity when reacting with an unspecific relay. 273 One interesting case of relay selectivity of a colloidal catalyst may be mentioned: The formation of hydrogen on platinized TiOa [17] is limited to conditions where the Nemst potential of the reaction medium is negative enough to inject electrons into the conduction band of the semiconductor particles [11]. In this case it is not the driving force for the electron transfer from substrate (reduced relay) to cosubstrate (water) but, in addition, a feature of the catalyst (the position of the conduction band) that is decisive for the reaction to proceed. At relatively small contents of noble metal, the whole surface of the oxide particles serves as a collector for electrons. Finally, with enzymes, substrate discrimination is made in addition on electrostatic and structural grounds; e.g., selectivity for ferredoxin was observed for hydrogenase from Clostridium pasteurianum and Megasphaera elsdenii, and neither reacts with cytochrome [2]. Catalysis on noble metal surfaces is not selective with respect to the molecule to be reduced, namely water: The reduction of oxygen is an undesired concurrent reaction. But there is also significant sensitivity of the enzymes to oxygen [18,19]. However, examples of aerobic hydrogen production in illuminated cell cultures have recently been given [10]. Inorganic catalysts (electronically conducting colloids) are still far from exhibiting selectivity as do enzymes, which is compensated for by smaller rate constants of the latter (k^. Table 1). Selectivity for the cosubstrate (HaO, H\"^), which would be one of the most desirable features in a multi- component, H^ synthesizing system in which oxidizing species may be pre- sent (e.g., the case of water splitting attempts), has not yet been demon- strated. Standards The most objective method for assaying hydrogenase is probably the study of the o-H^/p-H^ exchange reaction [20] since it does not rely on added carriers. For convenience, the activity of most enzymatic catalysts has been measured by reacting the enzyme with a mixture of methyl- viologen/dithionite/buffer, adjusted to give [MV\"1'] > 2i?m (substrate satura- tion). The amount of hydrogen evolved has then been measured as a func- tion of time. In some cases (Table 1, footnote (d)) measurements have been performed in the linear region of the rate-[substrate] plot. Problems with the dithionite method anse when assays are attempted at pH values lower than 7. There the effective redox potential of dithionite is higher, which leads to lower MV4\" concentrations (in most cases the value was not known or given) risking lower reaction rates which tend to be strongly dependent on the Nemst potential of the solution [21]. Also, the reaction of dithionite with ferredoxin or other relays [2] is slow, leading to too small or unknown [MV\"1\"] levels. In some cases electrochemical (Table 1, footnotes (e) and (j)) measuring techniques or kinetic spectroscopy (Table 1, footnote (i)) have been used. In the case of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, a photochemical relaxation method [11] (based on the kinetic analysis of the decay of [R~] due to reaction with hydrogenase when the continuous production of 274 the relay is suddenly stopped) was also used. A higher rate constant was found at pH 4.7 (compared to pH 7). The advantage of this technique over the dithionite method is the fact that measurements can be carried out at lower pH and [R~] can be varied and measured. The sensitivity allows measurements to be carried out directly in the linear region of the y~[R~] plot. It seems also to be most suited for the determination of activity of inorganic colloidal preparations. Also, an electrochemical method [41] (Table 1, footnote (j)) offers the possibility of measurement at low pH where maximal activity is sometimes observed (e.g. pH 4 for Clostridium pasteurianum, see Table 1). In any case, priority should be given to a method allowing measurements under working conditions; i.e., when the product (hydrogen) is actually produced, in order to avoid misinterpretation of results that are due to transient effects. These effects sometimes give rise to unrealistic estimations of activities (much too high) of colloidal noble metal suspensions, e.g. [17]. A last point may be addressed to synthetic organic catalysts mimicking the reaction centres of naturally occurring hydrogenases. Successful syn- thesis of analogues is confirmed by comparison of physicochemical data such as redox potentials and spectroscopic (also magnetic) features [5]. Reaction centers of hydrogenases have also been isolated by the core extru- sion technique [8,22,23]. Synthetic Fe4S4 centers [2] have been shown to replace ferredoxin in mediation of water reduction by Clostridium pas- teurianum (ultimate donor dithionite), but none of the synthetic or extruded clusters has yet been shown to be catalytically active itself. A catalyst synthesized from bovine serum albumine, ferrous ammonium sulfate, 2-mercaptoethanol and NazS has been shown to catalyze the produc- tion of hydrogen at a rather low rate (s2 X 10~10 mol H; 1~1 s\"1) in the presence of MV\"1\" [9]. No details about the structure are known and the performance of control (blank) experiments was not mentioned. The recent communication about coupling of a flavine coenzyme (the catalytic part of a flavoenzyme) to a synthetic crown ether as the recognition site [24] may indicate the direction to take in synthesizing a specific catalyst for water reduction. The data available today and the comparisons presented here allow a meaningful estimation of the range of catalyst performance in the hydrogen evolution reaction. We hope that the discussion of the catalyst activities and the problems connected to their comparison may encourage researchers to standardize experimental conditions in the future. References 1 H.
