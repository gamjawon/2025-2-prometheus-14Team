On both catalysts the main reaction of pure ethylbenzene is disproportionation, this reaction occurring mainly through diphenylethane intermediates. The main effect of platinum is to allow the bifunctional isomerization of ethylbenzene. In addition to disproportionation reactions, ethylbenzene in mixture with xylene is also transformed through similar mechanisms into dimethylethylbenzene (transethylation) and into ethylmethylbenzene (transmethylation). o-Xylene is rapidly transformed into m- and p-isomers. Large differences exist between MOR and ZSM-5 catalysts. ZSM-5 catalysts are very active for ethylbenzene dealkylation and Cs naphthenes hydrocracking while MOR catalysts are more active for xylene isomerization and disproportionation, and ethylbenzene hydroisomeriza- tion. Disproportionation of ethylbenzene occurs mainly on H-ZSM-5 through a deethylation-ethyla- tion mechanism and on HMOR through diphenylethane intermediates. Steric constraints on the formation of bulky bimolecular intermediates at channel intersections and diffusion limitations are responsible for the particular behaviour of ZSM-5 catalysts.

The transformation of the same feeds is carried out here on large pore zeolite catalysts HMOR and Pt-HMOR. The bifunctional Pt- HMOR catalyst, which is able to catalyze ethylbenzene isomerization, is used in various industrial processes of isomerization of the C8 aromatic cut ( e.g. Octafining from Arco-Engelhard) [2,3]. The differences in behaviour of H-ZSM-5 and HMOR catalysts and of Pt-H-ZSM-5 and Pt-HMOR catalysts will be discussed. 2. Experimental The mordenite catalyst (Si/A1 = 10) was supplied by TOSOH Corporation in the sodium form. Three exchanges with ammonium nitrate ( 10 M) and a calcination at 550 were necessary to prepare the protonic form of the mordenite (HMOR). The good crystallinity of this sample was shown by X-ray diffraction and by nitrogen adsorption. The acid and the bifunctional catalysts were prepared as a mechanical mixture of HMOR with y-Al203 catalyst or with Pt/y-Al~O3 catalyst (0.45 wt.-% Pt, dispersion close to 100%) supplied by the French Institute of Petroleum (IFP). The zeolite content was 60 wt.-%. The mixtures with y-A1203 will be designated HMOR and the mixture with Pt/y-A1203 Pt-HMOR. The operating procedures for the preparation of H-ZSM-5 and Pt-H-ZSM-5 catalysts, and for the transformations of pure ethylbenzene, and of the 20 wt.-% ethylbenzene- 80 wt.-% o-xylene mixture have been described previously [ 1 ]. 3. Results The reactions observed on H-ZSM-5 and Pt-H-ZSM-5 catalysts [1] are also found on HMOR and Pt-HMOR catalysts: -- Ethylbenzene disproportionation (reaction 1 ) -- Ethylbenzene dealkylation (reaction 2) -- Ethylbenzene isomerization into xylenes (reaction 3) -- Isomerization of o-xylene into m- and p-xylenes (reaction 4) -- Disproportionation of xylenes (reaction 5) -- Transethylation of ethylbenzene-xylenes (reaction 6) -- Transmethylation of ethylbenzene-xylenes (reaction 7) -- Secondary transformation of ethylene into C3-C~ aliphatics and into aromatics -- Hydrogenation of ethylene to ethane -- Hydrogenation of ethylbenzene, hydroisomerization into aromatics and hydrocracking of ethylcyclohexane The procedure developed for determining the conversion of ethylbenzene and xylenes on H-ZSM-5 and Pt-H-ZSM-5 catalysts [ 1 ] will be used here for HMOR and Pt-HMOR catalysts.

As was the case with H-ZSM-5 catalysts [ 1 ], the limited effect of contact time on ethylbenzene conversion can be explained by thermodynamic equilibrium. However in the case of HMOR deactivation could also explain the low value of ethylbenzene conversion found for the longer contact time (0.1 h l ). Indeed there is a significant decrease of ethylbenzene conversion (X) after successive experiments at 0.03 (X = 20.5%), 0.014, 0.1 then 0.03 h I (X= 17.8) (Fig. la) 3.2. Transformation of the ethylbenzene-o-xylene mixture On HMOR the main reaction products are benzene, toluene, m- and p-xylene, trimethylbenzenes, ethyltoluene, diethylbenzene and dimethylethylbenzene (Table 1). Ethylbenzene is mainly transformed through disproportionation (reaction 1), transethylation (reaction 6) and transmethylation (reaction 7). o-Xylene is rapidly transformed into m- and p-xylenes (reaction 4), into disproportionation (reaction 5) and transalkylation products (reactions 6 and 7) (Table 2). On Pt-HMOR in addition to the products found with HMOR a significant amount of C3-C8 is formed through ethylbenzene and xylenes hydrogenation, followed by hydroisomerization and hydrocracking of the naphthenes produced. 20 J.M.

Platinum causes an increase in ethylbenzene conversion (Fig. 2a). The rate of disproportionation is decreased (Fig. 2b), that of dealkylation slightly increased (Fig. 2c). The rate of transethylation is decreased and that of transmethylation remains practically unchanged. Other reactions responsible for the difference between the total conversion of ethylbenzene and the sum of the partial conversions are ethylbenzene isomerization into xylenes (reaction 3) and ethylbenzene hydro- genation and hydrocracking into C3-C8 products. J.M. Silva et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 125 (1995) 15-27 21 Platinum has practically no effect on the rate of xylene interisomerization: the approach to thermodynamic equilibrium (ATE) is similar with HMOR and Pt- HMOR. Thermodynamic equilibrium is obtained for relatively low contact time (Fig. 3a). Platinum increases the conversion of xylenes into other products (Fig. 3b). It increases the rate of disproportionation (Fig. 3c), decreases that of transe- thylation (Fig. 3d) and has practically no effect on transmethylation (Fig. 3e). Another significant reaction of xylenes is the transformation into C3-Cs products. 4. Discussion 4.1. Main reactions catalyzed by HMOR On HMOR, pure ethylbenzene undergoes two main reactions: disproportionation (reaction 1) and dealkylation (reaction 2), reaction 1 being about 6 times faster than reaction 2. Dealkylation occurs through the classical mechanism: adsorption of ethylbenzene on a protonic site, dealkylation of the ethylbenzenium ion formed with formation of an ethylcarbenium ion, desorption of ethylene [4]. Part of the disproportionation probably occurs through the mechanism of dealkylation-alkyl- ation generally accepted for ethylbenzene disproportionation on H-ZSM-5 catalysts [ 1,5,6]. However, the dealkylation rate being low, most of the disproportionation products formed on HMOR result from a mechanism which does not involve free ethylene as intermediate. The mechanism shown in Scheme 1 which also explains the disproportionation of methylaromatics is the most likely. It involves benzylic carbocations and diphenylethane intermediates [7,8]. The relative importance of the two pathways via ethylene or via diphenylethane inter- mediates depends on the zeolite and on the operating conditions. In particular the 22 J.M. Sih'a et al./ A1)plied Catalysis A: General 125 (1995) 15 27 dealkylation-alkylation mechanism is much favoured on medium pore zeolites and at high temperature [ 5 ]. Ethylbenzene in mixture with o-xylene is transformed on HMOR through dealky- lation (reaction 2), disproportionation (reaction 1), transethylation (reaction 6) and transmethylation (reaction 7), the three latter reactions occurring practically at the same rate and more rapidly than dealkylation. Some disproportionation and transethylation occurs through a deethylation-ethylation mechanism with ethylene as an intermediate while the larger part of these reactions as well as the transme- thylation would occur through diphenylethane intermediates. Although the partial pressure of ethylbenzene is four times lower than that of xylenes, transethylation of xylenes is not faster than ethylbenzene disproportionation. This could be due to steric constraints in the ethylation of xylenes. On HMOR o-xylene is very rapidly transformed into m- and p- isomers. This monomolecular reaction which occurs mainly through methyl shift in benzenium ion intermediates [9] is much faster than disproportionation (reaction 5) and transalkylation (reactions 6 and 7). As is expected from the lower partial pressure of ethylbenzene, the transfer of methyl between xylene molecules (disproportion- ation) is faster than the transfer of methyl from a xylene molecule to an ethylbenzene molecule. 4.2. Effect of platinum Platinum decreases the rate of ethylbenzene disproportionation (Figs. lb and 2b), increases slightly the rates of dealkylation (Figs. lc and 2c) and causes the occurrence of ethylbenzene isomerization (Fig. ld) and of ethylbenzene transfor- mation into C~-Cs products. The increase in the dealkylation rate and a large part of the decrease in the disproportionation rate can be related to the rapid hydrogen- ation of ethylene. Indeed disproportionation through ethylbenzene alkylation by ethylene is suppressed. However, part of the decrease in the disproportionation rate could be due to a decrease in the concentration of benzylic carbocations (inter- mediates in the mechanism which does not involve free ethylene). Indeed it has been proposed [ 10] that hydrogen, in particular if activated by metals, reacts with benzylic carbocations, decreasing the disproportionation rate + H ~/~+ H2 \"~\"~ ~+ (2) As expected [2], Pt-HMOR is an active catalyst for ethylbenzene isomerization. The bifunctional mechanism of this reaction involves hydrogenation of ethylben- zene on platinum sites into very reactive ethylcyclohexene intermediates, skeletal isomerization of these ethylcyclohexenes on the acid sites and finally, dehydroge- nation of the produced dimethylcyclohexenes into xylene isomers [ 11,12]. C8 alkylcyclohexanes and cyclopentanes and C3-C5 alkanes are simultaneously J.M. Silva et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 125 (1995) 15-27 23 formed through hydrogenation, hydroisomerization and hydrocracking reactions. Although Pt-HMOR catalyses the isomerization of ethylbenzene, platinum has no effect on ATE (the approach to thermodynamic equilibrium of xylenes) (Fig. 3a). This shows that, compared to the acid mode, the bifunctional mode of xylene interisomerization (through dimethylcyclohexene intermediates) is negligible. On the other hand platinum increases the rate of xylene disproportionation (Fig. 3c) and decreases slightly that of transethylation (Fig. 3d). The decrease in transethy- lation can be related to the hydrogenation of ethylene, with consequently, the suppression of transethylation through alkylation of xylene by ethylene. The increase in the rate of xylene disproportionation is more difficult to explain. Indeed a slight decrease, due to a decrease in the concentration of benzylic carbocations was expected. A possible explanation is that on HMOR there is a competition between ethylene and xylene for adsorption on the protonic sites. Therefore the hydrogenation of ethylene would lead to an increase in the concentration of benzylic carbocations, hence to an increase in xylene disproportionation. 4.3. Comparison of ZSM-5 and MOR catalysts HMOR is less active than H-ZSM-5 for ethylbenzene conversion (Fig. 4a). This is mainly due to the very high activity of H-ZSM-5 for dealkylation (Fig. 4b). H- ZSM-5 is also more active for ethylbenzene disproportionation (Fig. 4c). Again this is related to the very high activity of H-ZSM-5 for dealkylation-alkylation reactions. Indeed with the H-ZSM-5 zeolite disproportionation occurs through a dealkylation-alkylation mechanism while on HMOR it occurs mainly through diphenylethane intermediates without participation of the ethylene. A curious observation is that with H-ZSM-5 the percentage of disproportionation products decreases with increasing contact time (Fig. 4c). This has been explained by a secondary dealkylation of diethylbenzene [ 1 ]. The same differences are noted for the transformation of ethylbenzene mixed with o-xylene. Furthermore, HMOR is more active than H-ZSM-5 for the isomerization of o-xylene into m- and p-xylenes. Indeed for the same contact time, ATE (the approach to thermodynamic equilib- rium) is larger with HMOR than with H-ZSM-5 (Fig. 5a). This is probably due to limitations in the diffusion of xylenes in the narrow pores of H-ZSM-5. The activity of the HMOR for xylene disproportionation is also higher (Fig. 5b). The low activity of H-ZSM-5 for this reaction is most likely due to steric constraints on the formation of diphenylmethane intermediates in the pores of this zeolite. Greater differences in rates of xylene disproportionation were expected. It is therefore probable that part of the xylene disproportionation found with H-ZSM-5 occurs on the acid sites of the outer surface of the crystallites. Formation of methylethylben- zene by transmethylation (reaction 7 ) which, like xylene disproportionation, occurs through diphenylmethane intermediates on both zeolites is also faster on HMOR than on the H-ZSM-5 [ 1 ]. On the other hand transethylation (reaction 6) which involves ethylene as an intermediate on H-ZSM-5 (deethylation-ethylation mech- 24 J.M.

Pt-H-ZSM-5 is more active than Pt-HMOR for ethylbenzene transformation (Fig. 6a). This is due, as with the acid zeolites, to the high activity of the ZSM-5 catalyst for ethylbenzene dealkylation (Fig. 6b). The percentage of ethylbenzene conversion into disproportionation products is higher at long contact times on HMOR than on H-ZSM-5 (Fig. 6c).

Moreover Pt-HMOR is active for ethylbenzene isom- erization while Pt-H-ZSM-5 is practically inactive. This could be related to the high selectivity of Pt-H-ZSM-5 for hydrocracking [ 13 ]. Indeed, although the production of C3-C8 non-aromatic compounds occurs at the same rate on Pt-HMOR and Pt- H-ZSM-5 the distributions are completely different. On Pt-HMOR the hydrocrack- ing of C8 naphthenes is limited while on Pt-H-ZSM-5 nearly all the C8 naphthenes are transformed into lighter products (Fig. 6d). This high selectivity for hydro- cracking products has already been observed for n-heptane transformation [ 13 ]. It was suggested that due to their slow migration in the narrow pores of ZSM-5, olefinic intermediates underwent successive isomerization and cracking steps dur- ing their migration between two platinum crystallites. The same differences between Pt-HMOR and Pt-H-ZSM-5 are found for the transformation of ethylbenzene mixed with o-xylene. Furthermore, as with the acid catalysts and for the same reasons, Pt-HMOR is more active than Pt-H-ZSM-5 for xylene isomerization (Fig. 7a), for xylene disproportionation (Fig. 7b) and for the transmethylation reaction (Fig. 7c). The production of ethylmethylbenzene (tran- sethylation, reaction 7), which occurs through a deethylation-ethylation mecha- nism on ZSM-5 catalysts is very slow on Pt-H-ZSM-5 (Fig. 7d), because of the 26 J.M.

It is not the case on Pt-HMOR, as transethylation occurs through diphenylethane intermediates. 5. Conclusion The reactions occurring during the transformation of an ethylbenzene-o-xylene mixture on acid and bifunctional HMOR catalysts are identified and their rates compared. With both catalysts, the most rapid reaction of xylenes is their interi- somerization, the other reactions being disproportionation and transalkylation; ethylbenzene undergoes disproportionation, transalkylation and dealkylation. In addition Pt-HMOR catalyses the bifunctional isomerization of ethylbenzene into xylenes and the formation of C8 naphthenes through hydrogenation of xylenes and ethylbenzene on the platinum sites and bifunctional isomerization of the resulting ethyl- and dimethylcyclohexanes into alkylcyclopentanes. There are large differences in the behaviour of MOR and ZSM-5 catalysts. In particular H-ZSM-5 catalysts are very active for ethylbenzene dealkylation, while HMOR catalysts are more active for xylene isomerization and disproportionation. J.M. Silva et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 125 (1995) 15 27 27 Due to the high activity of H-ZSM-5 catalysts for dealkylation, disproportionation of ethylbenzene and transethylation occurs through a deethylation-ethylation mech- anism. With HMOR catalysts only a small part of these reactions occurs through this latter mechanism, the larger part involving diphenylethane intermediates. With H-ZSM-5 the main effect of platinum is to increase significantly the conversion of ethylbenzene into dealkylation products because of ethylene hydrogenation, hence to the displacement of thermodynamic equilibrium, while with HMOR platinum allows the bifunctional isomerization of ethylbenzene into xylenes.

The transformation of pure ethylbenzene and of an ethylbenzene (20wt.-%)-o-xylene (80 wt.-%) mixture is carried out on acid and bifunctional HMOR catalysts under the following conditions: fixed bed reactor, temperature 410°C, 0.96 MPa pressure of hydrogen and 0.24 MPa pressure of hydrocarbons, weight of hydrocarbon injected per weight of catalyst and per hour between 10 and 110. On both catalysts the main reaction of pure ethylbenzene is disproportionation, this reaction occurring mainly through diphenylethane intermediates. The main effect of platinum is to allow the bifunctional isomerization of ethylbenzene. In addition to disproportionation reactions, ethylbenzene in mixture with xylene is also transformed through similar mechanisms into dimethylethylbenzene (transethylation) and into ethylmethylbenzene (transmethylation). o-Xylene is rapidly transformed into m-andp-isomers.

ZSM-5 catalysts are very active for ethylbenzene dealkylation and C8 naphthenes hydrocracking while MOR catalysts are more active for xylene isomerization and disproportionation, and ethylbenzene hydroisomerization. Disproportionation of ethylbenzene occurs mainly on H-ZSM-5 through a deethylation-ethylation mechanism and on HMOR through diphenylethane intermediates. Steric constraints on the formation of bulky bimolecular intermediates at channel intersections and diffusion limitations are responsible for the particular behaviour of ZSM-5 catalysts.
