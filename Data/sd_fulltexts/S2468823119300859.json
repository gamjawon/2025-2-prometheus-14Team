Discipline of Chemistry Indian Institute of Technology Indore Simrol Indore 453552 India Graphical abstract A series of monoligated bidentate aminophosphine (PN) based Noyori-type bifunctional Mn(I)-complexes has been studied for CO2 hydrogenation. The NH functionality of the PN ligand shows a metal–ligand cooperation (MLC) mechanism for CO2 hydrogenation. We show here that it is not essential for a NH functionality to show cooperation via cleavage/formation of NH bond as reported in the case of classical Noyori mechanism for ketone hydrogenation. Rather than this, the NH functionality can work as a chemically innocent ligand for stabilizing the formate anion via NH⋯O hydrogen bonding. More importantly, such stabilized formate anion favours the heterolytic H2 cleavage, which is otherwise a rate determining step. Furthermore, we show that the NH functionality plays a key role for such metal–ligand cooperation mechanism. Therefore, present study will provide an exclusive feature of chemically innocent cooperation in bifunctional catalysts for the development of more efficient catalysts design for CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Keywords NH functionality DFT CO2 hydrogenation Metal-ligand Cooperation Chemically innocent ligand 1 Introduction The increasing demand of energy leads to search for various sources of alternative energies. H2 is a promising source of such energy, which can be used directly or indirectly [1]. However, one of the main issues of H2 is its gaseous form, which is not convenient for storage and transportation [2,3]. The catalytic CO2 hydrogenation to formic acid (liquid) is one of the promising approaches for H2 storage as well as effective utilization of CO2 [4–6]. So far, several transition metals based homogeneous catalysts have been experimentally as well as theoretically studied for CO2 hydrogenation [7–20] and cyclic carbonates formation [21–23]. However, most of these active catalysts are noble metal based catalysts. Therefore, inexpensive and earth abundant transition metals based (Fe, Co, Ni, and Mn) catalysts have been receiving more attention from the scientific community. Beller and co-workers have been reported a series of iron and cobalt complexes using tetraphos ligand; out of which Co complexes show more catalytic activity compared to the Fe complexes [24,25]. Later, Milstein and co-workers studied CO2 hydrogenation at low pressure using aromatic pincer ligand-based Fe complexes [26,27]. After that several other earth abundant transition metals based catalysts have been investigated for CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Nevertheless, the activities of these complexes are very low compared to the noble metal based complexes. So, several computational and experimental groups have been engaged in understanding the detailed mechanism for CO2 hydrogenation reactions, which may be a crucial step in terms of designing non-noble transition metal based homogeneous catalysts for efficient CO2 hydrogenation reaction [28–42]. Ahlquist and Yang demonstrated that heterolytic H2 cleavage is the rate determining step (RDS) in aromatic PNP (PNP = 2,6-bis(dialkylphosphinomethyl)-pyridine) based Ir, Fe and Co complexes [17,18]. Similarly, Hou et al. established that heterolytic H2 cleavage is the RDS for half-sandwich transition metal (M = Co, Rh, and Ir) based complexes [20]. On the other hand, Jeletic et al. have demonstrated that hydride transfer is the RDS in [CoI(dmpe)2H] (dmpe = 1,2-bis(dimethylphosphino)ethane) complex as heterolytic H2 cleavage is a favorable process in the presence of a strong external base [28,29]. After that, Ogo et al. have done a very systematic study on CO2 hydrogenation using [Cp*IrIII(bpy)(H)]+ (Cp*= η5-C5Me5, bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) and [(η6-C6Me6)RuII(bpy)H]+ complexes and they observe that hydride transfer and heterolytic H2 cleavage are the RDS for Ir (III) and Ru (II) complexes, respectively [16]. These earlier studies suggest that the hydride transfer to the CO2 molecule and heterolytic cleavage of H2 molecule are the two RDS for CO2 hydrogenation. Hence, it is very important to understand the nature of RDS - so that we can improve the RDS, which in turn would be very helpful in designing earth abundant metal based efficient catalysts. To improve the RDS, several ligands have been designed in such a way that they can participate in the reaction and improve the RDS. For example, the aromatic PNP ligands based complexes show higher catalytic activity due to the chemical nature of the PNP ligand. Here, PNP ligand shows metal–ligand cooperation (MLC) mechanism via aromatization/dearomatization of the ligand. In this case, the dearomatization of PNP initiates the heterolytic H2 cleavage [12,19]. On the other hand, many detailed mechanistic based studies suggest that dearomatization of PNP is a less favorable process [17,18]. Further improvement has been made via ligand modification. For example, Himeda et al. have reported 6,6′-R2-bpy (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine, ROH) ligand based Ir complexes for CO2 hydrogenation and suggested that the hydroxyl groups at 6,6′ position act as a pendant base and assist the heterolytic H2 cleavage [43,44]. Similarly, theoretical studies by our group and Yang et al. revealed that Fe complexes with pendant amine ligand are promising for CO2 hydrogenation, where pendant amine lowers the heterolytic H2 cleavage barrier significantly [33,34]. In all these previous studies, it has been shown that ligand actively participates in the heterolytic H2 cleavage. Similarly, classical Noyori mechanism metal-ligand bifunctional catalysts have been known for active involvement of the ligand in various hydrogenations and other important chemical transformations [45,46]. For example, in case of NH functionality based metal catalysts, the NH functionality plays a crucial role in facilitating hydrogenation reaction via formation/cleavage of the NH bond. However, Dub et al. suggest a new mechanism for the Noyori hydrogenation reaction, where they have reported that the NH bond is not formed/cleaved in ketone hydrogenation rather involved in stabilizing the oxy-anion(−O-) intermediate via a strong hydrogen-bonding interaction (NH⋯O) and such oxy-anion intermediate further leads to the heterolytic H2 cleavage [47–49]. Thus, NH bond helps in stabilization the oxy-anion intermediate, this oxy-anion further initiates the heterolytic H2cleavage. Interestingly, NH functionality plays an important role for CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Therefore, it would be interesting to see whether bifunctional based catalysts can be promising for CO2 hydrogenation reaction or not. Besides, we would like to know whether such NH functionality shows cleavage/formation of bond or only stabilizes the formate anion during CO2 hydrogenation? Does (NH···O) hydrogen bonding interaction also play a key role in heterolytic cleavage of H2 molecule or not? So, inspired by these studies, we have designed a series of bidentate aminophosphine (PN) based bifunctional Mn (I) complexes (Fig. 1 ) for CO2 hydrogenation. The Mn-PN complex has been synthesized and reported to show excellent catalytic activity for esters hydrogenation [50]. To understand the role of the NH functionality, we have substituted the hydrogen atoms by methyl (-Me) groups to model Mn-PN, Mn-PN-Me, Mn-PN-Me', and Mn-PN-Me2 complexes as shown in Fig. 1. 2 Computational details All calculations are performed using the Gaussian 09 D.01 program package [51]. All the geometry optimization and vibrational frequency calculations are carried out using B3LYP/D3 functional [52–56] with LANL2DZ basis set for Mn [57,58] and 6-31++G(d, p) basis set for all the other elements (H, C, N, O and P) [59–61]. The B3LYP functional has been chosen for our study as previous studies demonstrated the accuracy of the method on different Mn(I) system for the CO2 reduction/hydrogenation [32,40,41,62]. The solvent phase geometries are fully optimized using conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM) for the THF solvent [63,64]. Moreover, vibrational frequencies are considered to identify the stationary points of intermediates and transition states (TSs). All the intermediates are verified as local minima on the potential energy surface with no imaginary frequencies. All the transition states (TSs) verified with one imaginary frequency representing the desired reaction coordinate and further confirmed by intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations. The reaction free energies are calculated at 298.15 K and 1 atmosphere pressure. The zero-point vibrational energy (ZPVE) and thermal corrections are included in total electronic energies for reaction free energy calculations. The free energy difference between the final and initial states are considered for reaction free energies (ΔG). On the other hand, free energy difference between the transition state and initial state are considered free energy barriers ( Δ G ‡ ) calculations. Previously, Pidko and coworkers have used PBE0 functional for Mn-PN type of complexes [50] For comparisons, we have calculated single-point energy using PBE0 functional from B3LYP optimized geometries. We find that the trend remains same (Figure S1). We have investigated the H-bonding interactions using the non-covalent interaction NCI program [65,66] and we have used VMD program [67] for their visualizations. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis has been done to investigate the natural atomic orbital and natural bond orbital using the NBO Version 3.1 program [68]. The energetic span of the catalytic cycle (δE) is calculated using TOF- determining transition state (TDTS) and TOF-determining intermediate (TDI) [69]. The δE is calculated as follows: δ E = { T T D T S - I T D I i f T D T S a p p e a r s a f t e r T D I ( 1 ) T T D T S - I T D I + Δ G r x n i f T D T S a p p e a r s b e f o r e T D I ( 2 ) 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Metal–ligand cooperative CO2 hydrogenation In such conventional cooperative mechanism, the MH and NH bonds actively participate in the reaction mechanism as proposed by Noyori for asymmetric hydrogenation reaction [45,46]. Hence, the formation/cleavage of MH and NH bonds is very important for hydride/proton transfer related catalytic hydrogenation reactions. On the other hand, in some cases, the NH functionality does not participate directly in the reaction but helps in stabilizing the important intermediates. Based on these possibilities, our study has been divided into two parts: (i) cooperative and chemically non-innocent mechanism, where NH functionality directly participates in the reaction and (ii) cooperative and chemically innocent mechanism, where NH functionality does not actively participate in the reaction. 3.2 Cooperative and chemically non-innocent mechanism The proposed mechanism for Mn-PN-Me catalyzed CO2 hydrogenation is shown in Scheme 1. This is very similar to the proposed classical Noyori mechanism for ketone hydrogenation where hydride and proton transfer takes place from the MH and NH bond, respectively. Here, hydride transfer to CO2 and heterolytic H2 cleavage are the two-key steps. We consider hydride transfer to CO2 (1→3) as the very first step for CO2 hydrogenation. In intermediate 1, the Mn-H bond is hydridic, whereas the NH bond is protonic. Therefore, 1 can take part in the metal-ligand cooperation mechanism for CO2 hydrogenation. In the very first step, CO2 molecule can interact with the MH/N-H bond of intermediate 1 for the formation of 2. In intermediate 2, C atom of CO2 interacts with the hydridic H atom with a Mn-H⋯C bond distance of 2.563 Å (Figure S2) and O atom interacts with the NH proton with a NH⋯O distance of 2.331 Å. Such NH⋯O hydrogen-bonding interactions may be helpful for hydride transfer mechanism. This may lead to the formation of H-bound formate (3), which may be further stabilized through an NH⋯O hydrogen bonding (1.870 Å). Therefore, this (2→3) may be an important step for the reaction as hydride transfer is a very important step for CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Fig. 2 shows the reaction free energy profile for Scheme 1 . The calculated reaction free energy barrier (TS1) for the hydride transfer is 5.8 kcal/mol with a reaction free energy of 1.6 kcal/mol. This indicates that such metal-ligand cooperative mechanism facilitates the hydride transfer mechanism in Mn-PN-Me complex. Furthermore, we find that the H-bound formate can be easily isomerized to O-bound formate (3→3′) via transition state TS2 as it requires a free energy barrier of 6.1 kcal/mol. On the other hand, the intermediate 3 can transfer proton to one of the O of formate for the formation of 4. Furthermore, formic acid may be released from 4 for the formation of 5. The intermediate 5 has a vacant co-ordination site, where H2 may interact for the formation of a η2-coordinated dihydrogen intermediate 6. The amido group near the Mn-center has a lone pair, which may initiate the heterolytic H2 cleavage for the regeneration of the catalyst 1. The heterolytic H2 cleavage involves a four-member ring (Fig. 2) transition state (TS4) with a reaction free energy barrier of 1.9 kcal/mol. This indicates that such amido group favours the heterolytic H2 cleavage. Furthermore, we have calculated the energetic span for the catalytic cycle, and the calculated energetic span of the cycle (Fig. 2) is 40.0 kcal/mol. In the cooperative and chemically non-innocent mechanism, 3′ and TS4 are considered as TDI and TDTS, respectively. This indicates that such a mechanism requires a very high energetic span for CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Similarly, the energetic span of the cycle (Figure S3) is 40.0 kcal/mol for Mn-PN complex. On the contrary, Mn-PN-Me' and Mn-PN-Me2 may not take part in such mechanism as the NH bond is present in Mn-PN-Me' complex in the opposite side of the Mn-H bond, whereas there are no NH bonds present in Mn-PN-Me2 to interact with CO2. We have also considered the coordination of H2 molecule with 4 before the release of formic acid but it also required high energetic span of the cycle (Figure S4). Furthermore, the role of external base NHMe2 on the different catalytic steps is studied explicitly for Scheme 1. As external base generally used to release formate anion in the reaction. We find that the external base does not affect the overall energetic span of the cycle (Figure S5). Therefore, we did use base explicitly for the further calculations. 3.3 Cooperative and chemically innocent mechanism Hence, we have considered a cooperative and chemically innocent mechanism (Scheme 2 ) as the classical cooperative mechanism requires a very high free energy barrier for CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Fig. 3 represents the reaction free energy profile for such mechanism. Here, we have proposed two different reaction mechanisms from intermediate 3, which is a common reaction intermediate for both the reaction pathways (Schemes 1 and 2). In the first mechanism, we consider that H2 molecule would bind to the vacant Mn site for the formation of a η2-coordinated Mn-H2 complex (3→7) as soon as the formate ion released (Figure S6). In the next step, we propose an external base NHMe2 assisted heterolytic H2 cleavage. The external base NHMe2 is chosen as such base reported to be excellent for heterolytic H2 cleavage [32,35,70,71]. On the other hand, Pidko and coworkers have used KOtBu for the ester hydrogenation reaction when catalyzed by the Mn-PN based catalysts. However, the role of KOtBu is to activate the precatalyst for the reaction [50,72]. In CO2 hydrogenation reaction, KOtBu is also used to activate the precatalyst [14]. But, our starting complex is already an active catalyst (1) and, thus we considered NHMe2 base for heterolytic H2 cleavage reaction. We find that the NHMe2 base initiated heterolytic H2 cleavage occurs via TS5 with a free energy barrier of 2.8 kcal/mol. Therefore, it requires a low barrier for heterolytic cleavage. However, the external base assisted CO2 hydrogenation process (3→7→1) is not a favourable process as it has an energetic span of 36.2 kcal/mol where 3′ and TS5 are considered as TDI and TDTS, respectively. Previously, it has been reported that the chemical nature of the NH bond plays a crucial role in the ketone hydrogenation reactions as it stabilizes the oxy-anion intermediate through a strong NH⋯O hydrogen-bonding interaction rather than participating in the NH bond formation/cleavage [47–49]. Since, formate is an oxy-anion, we predict that the formate may dissociate from the Mn center to form a strong NH⋯O hydrogen-bonding interaction with NH bond of the ligand. At the same time, H2 molecule may bind to the vacant Mn-site via TS6 for the formation of 10. The calculated reaction free energy barrier for H2 binding is 11.0 kcal/mol. Surprisingly, formation of 10 (3→10) is 13.2 and 9.2 kcal/mol more favorable than the formation of 7 (3→7) and 9 (3→9), respectively. These results indicate that the NH moiety plays a crucial role in stabilizing the formate via NH···O hydrogen bonding. Furthermore, we find that formate anion favours the heterolytic H2 cleavage (10→11) as it requires a free energy barrier of 0.9 kcal/mol. This agrees well with the previous studies that formate anion behaves as a base and initiates the H2 cleavage [14,37,39]. Morover, formation of 11 is an exergonic process by 7.7 kcal/mol. Furthermore, formic acid would react with base NH(CH3)2 to release [HNH(CH3)2]+[HCO2]− for the regeneration of catalyst 1. This is calculated to be an exergonic process with a reaction free energy of 4.5 kcal/mol. This is consistent with the previous studies that the external base prefers to react with formic acid for the formation of [HNH(CH3)2]+[HCO2]− adduct. The energetic span of the cycle is 25.2 kcal/mol (3→10) for the formate assisted heterolytic H2 cleavage pathway. The 3′ and TS6 are the TDI and TDTS, respectively for the catalytic cycle when ligand acts as an innocent ligand. Thus, the energetic span of the cycle is significantly lower (25.2 kcal/mol) compared to the external base initiated (36.2 kcal/mol) heterolytic H2 cleavage. Previously, Gonsalvi and co-workers have been reported 27.6 kcal/mol energetic span of the cycle for CO2 hydrogenation reaction when catalyzed by Mn(PNPNH−iPr)(H)(CO) 2 [37]. Recently Yang and coworkers reported energetic span of the cycle of 28.3 kcal/mol for Mn bipyridinol complex [73]. All these Mn-complexes have been experimentally reported for CO2hydrogenation to formate. Therefore, our calculated energetic span of the cycle suggests that N–H functionality based Mn-PN complex can be very promising for CO2 hydrogenation reaction as their energetic span are comparable/lower compared to the previously reported Mn-complexes. Furthermore, we have investigated (Figure S7-S9) the other Mn (I) complexes for CO2 hydrogenation via the formate assisted heterolytic H2 cleavage mechanism. We find that the calculated energetic span of the cycle for Mn-PN (Figure S7) is 25.3 kcal/mol, which is comparable with Mn-PN-Me. On the other hand, the energetic spans of the cycle are higher for Mn-PN-Me' (29.8 kcal/mol) and Mn-PN-Me2 (31.5 kcal/mol) complexes due to the absence of NH⋯O hydrogen-bonding interactions. So, CO2 hydrogenation via formate initiated heterolytic H2 cleavage is favourable over external base/ligand initiated H2 cleavage, which even further improved in the presence of NH functionality. Furthermore, we have proposed another mechanism where both formate and external base attack together for heterolytic H2 cleavage as shown in Scheme S1. The calculated energetic spans of the cycle (Figure S10) are 28.1 and 27.8 kcal/mol via formate + base assisted (TDTS TS7) and base + formate assisted (TDTS TS8) mechanisms, respectively. So, the energetic span of the cycle (∼28 kcal/mol) is higher compared to N-H and formate assisted (25.2 kcal/mol) mechanism (Scheme 2). 3.4 Role of non-innocent and innocent ligand Furthermore, we have investigated the underlying reason behind the very large free energy barrier for the classical Noyori type hydrogenation mechanism for CO2 hydrogenation. To understand this, we have analyzed the molecular orbitals and structural parameters (Fig. 4 ) of 1, 5, and 6 as they show different chemical nature of NH functionality within PN ligand. Therefore, we have investigated intermediate 1 with NH functionality, whereas intermediates 5 and 6 without NH functionality. Fig. 2 shows that intermediates 5 and 6 are highly destabilized in the reaction free energy profile. This could be due to deprotonation in 5 and 6. The frontier molecular orbitals of these complexes (Fig. 4) suggest that HOMO (-6.21 eV) of 1 is the most stabilized followed by HOMO in 5 and HOMO in 6. This is very much consistent with their position in the reaction free energy profile. In case of 5, the lone pair of N atom is interacting with the Mn, which leads to a Mn-N bond length of 1.876 Å i.e. shorter compared to that in 1 (2.278 Å). In case of 6, the lone pair localizes back to on N atom as soon as H2 molecule binds to Mn. Such localization of lone pair on N atom destabilizes the HOMO in 6, which in turn destabilizes the intermediate 6 (Fig. 2). Therefore, the NH functionality plays an important role as it increases the total free energy barrier in the case of classical cooperative mechanism. Furthermore, NBO analysis has been done to investigate the bonding between Mn-N in 1, 5 and 6. In the case of 1, we find that there is a lone pair on the N atom of the ligand, which is weakly interacting with the Mn atom. Our molecular orbital study also reveals that there is a bond between Mn and N, in which maximum orbital contribution come from the N orbital. However, our NBO analysis suggests that a Mn = N double bond (one σ and one π) is formed in 5. In the π bond, Mn atomic hybrid contributions is 20.20%, whereas N atomic hybrid contributions up to 79.80% with a pure p character (99.22%). This further confirms the delocalization of the N lone pair by Mn atom in 5. On the other hand, NBO analysis of 6 suggests that there is a Mn-N σ bond, whereas the π bond electrons localize back to the N atom. Interestingly, the innocent nature of NH bond favors CO2 hydrogenation reaction compared to the non-innocent nature of NH. Here, the innocent nature of NH bond shows hydrogen-bonding interactions, which plays a crucial role in the stabilization of intermediates 3 and 10 (Fig. 3) through metal ligand participation. However, such hydrogen-bonding interactions are less in Mn-PN-Me' as the NH group is directed opposite to the formate anion as shown in Figure 6. This is done to understand the importance of the extent of noncovalent interactions for CO2 hydrogenation as the calculated barriers are higher when NH group is directed opposite to formate anion. For this, we have investigated the noncovalent interaction index (NCI) and their related structural parameters (Fig. 5 and Figure S12-13). The NCI plots help in visualizing and efficiently identifying the inter- and intramolecular interactions contribution. NCI plots are completely based on the reduced density gradient and its molecular density. The lower values of reduced density gradient and density represent the existing non-convent interaction. This defines isosurface region, where blue and green color area represent the stronger and weaker interactions, respectively. We find that the NH⋯O (1.870 Å) and CH⋯O (2.571 Å) interactions are present in 3-Mn-PN-Me and 3-Mn-PN-Me', respectively. Fig. 5 shows that NH⋯O interaction is stronger than C–H···O interaction and this is very much in agreement with our relative energetics as 3-Mn-PN-Me complex is 2.9 kcal/mol more stable than the 3-Mn-PN-Me'. In case of 10-Mn-PN-Me, NH⋯O (1.743 Å) and HH⋯O (2.065 Å) interactions are present, whereas in 10-Mn-PN-Me', CH⋯O (2.109 Å) and HH⋯O (2.061 Å) interactions are present. We find that 10-Mn-PN-Me is 5.3 kcal/mol more stable than the 10-Mn-PN-Me' and this could be again due to the stronger NH⋯O interaction over CH⋯O interaction. Therefore, the extent of hydrogen bonding interactions is very important for the stabilization of formate anion, which further favours the heterolytic H2 cleavage and lowers the overall barrier. These results suggest that the chemically innocent nature of the NH functionality is very important over the chemically non-innocent nature of NH functionality for CO2 hydrogenation reaction. 4 Conclusions In conclusion, we have investigated a series of monoligated PN based bifunctional Mn(I)-catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation. Interestingly, it is observed that the NH functionality of the PN ligand can show a molecular Mn/NH bifunctional nature via metal–ligand cooperation mechanism. Furthermore, the cooperation mode (chemically non-innocent vs. innocent) of the NH functionality in metal–ligand cooperation mechanism has been investigated to understand the role of NH functionality in details. We find that the Mn-PN-Me catalyst requires a total free energy barrier of 40.0 kcal/mol when the reaction proceeds via classical cooperation mechanism. In this case, the NH functionality plays an active role in the reaction by participating through cleavage/formation of NH bond as the case for classical Noyori type mechanism reported for ketone hydrogenation. Surprisingly, the catalyst requires a total barrier of 25.2 kcal/mol when the reaction proceeds via chemically innocent cooperation mechanism. In this case, the NH bond does not actively participate in the reaction mechanism via cleavage/formation of NH bond. Rather than this, it stabilizes the formate anion, which in turn initiates the H2 cleavage. Our results reveal that NH functionality plays a crucial role in stabilizing the formate anion via NH⋯O hydrogen bonding and such stabilized formate anion lowers the heterolytic H2 cleavage barrier significantly. This suggests that NH functionality can show cooperation by stabilizing the anion intermediate rather than cleavage/formation of NH bond. Furthermore, we observe that the CO2 hydrogenation activation barrier increases when NH group is substituted by the N-Me group due to the absence of NH⋯O hydrogen-bonding interactions. Therefore, chemical nature of NH functionality is very important for the stabilization of formate anion which further favours heterolytic H2 cleavage. Thus, we believe our study will be instrumental in designing bifunctional ligand-based catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation reactions.

        "dc:description": "A series of monoligated bidentate aminophosphine (PN) based Noyori-type bifunctional Mn(I)-complexes has been studied for CO2 hydrogenation. The NH functionality of the PN ligand shows a metal–ligand cooperation (MLC) mechanism for CO2 hydrogenation. We show here that it is not essential for a NH functionality to show cooperation via cleavage/formation of NH bond as reported in the case of classical Noyori mechanism for ketone hydrogenation. Rather than this, the NH functionality can work as a chemically innocent ligand for stabilizing the formate anion via NH⋯O hydrogen bonding. More importantly, such stabilized formate anion favours the heterolytic H2 cleavage, which is otherwise a rate determining step. Furthermore, we show that the NH functionality plays a key role for such metal–ligand cooperation mechanism. Therefore, present study will provide an exclusive feature of chemically innocent cooperation in bifunctional catalysts for the development of more efficient catalysts design for CO2 hydrogenation reaction.",
