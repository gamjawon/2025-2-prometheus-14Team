CHIPARA Institute for Physics and Technology of Materials, Magurele, Bucharest (Romania) Summary Tungsten hexachloride, after 20 min contact with cyclopentene at room temperature, exhibited an ESR signal with ag-factor of 1.918 0.004, flw = 70 G, AH~ 25 G, assigned to a W(V) species. The intensity of this signal increased with time and showed a maximum after 200 min. After 72 h interaction, a second signal with a g-factor of 1.680 0.04, AJf = 110 10 G, assigned to a W(III) species was detected. In a control experiment, the same W(III) signal was recorded for a reduced tungsten compound (in aqueous medium) whose oxidation state was determined by cerium sulphate titration. The above W(V) signal also resulted from the interaction of WCle with cyclo- hexene, cyclo-octene and cyclododecene. The variation with time of the intensity of this signal was characteristic for each cyclo-olefin. Higher reduc- tion rates were observed for cyclopentene and cyclo-octene. Three distinct ESR signals were recorded during the polymerization of cyclopentene in the presence of the WCl6/epichlorohydrin/i-Bu3Al system. The first signal (g = 1.955 0.005, Aff=65G) was assigned to a W(V) species, the second (g = 1.720 0.03, AH = 45 G) to a W(III) species and the third {g = 2.018 0.002, AH = 30 G) to a hydrocarbon radical species. The intensity of the W(III) species was related to the polymerization activity while that of the hydrocarbon radical species was related to catalyst deac- tivation. The ESR spectrum obtained during the interaction of cyclohexene with the WCl6/epichlorohydrin/i-Bu3Al system exhibited three characteristic signals (gi = 2.008 0.001, AHi = 12 G;g^ = 1.830 0.02, AH^ = 60-100 G; g3 = 1.740 0.02, Afl3 = 40 G) assigned to the W(V) and W(III) species. * Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/85/$3.30 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 352 Reduction of WCl6 with i-Bu3Al in toluene in the absence of cyclo- olefin resulted in a complex spectrum in which signals assigned to W(V) and W(III) appeared together with other unidentified signals. The role of the cyclo-olefin in controlling the reduction of WClg to lower oxidation states is outlined. Introduction The changes in the valency states of transition metals during olefin metathesis and the ring-opening polymerization of cyclo-olefins still remain an unsolved problem. Attempts to investigate some of the paramagnetic species which possibly appear during these processes have been unsuccessful till now [1,2]. In the present paper we report our preliminary results, obtained by ESR measurements, concerning the nature of the paramagnetic species detected during the interaction of WClg with cyclo-olefins and in the ring-opening polymerization of cyclo-olefins (e.g. cyclopentene) with WCle- based catalysts. Experimental ESR measurements were obtained with a JES-ME-3X spectrometer, operating in the X-band frequency (9 GHz) using DPPH as the standard. The spectra were recorded at room temperature or at liquid nitrogen tem- perature. In experiments at liquid nitrogen temperature, quartz insertion Dewars were used. Samples were introduced in quartz tubes sealed under high vacuum (10~3 torr); some samples were prepared in a dry argon atmo- sphere. The apparatus used for ESR measurements of both the interaction between cyclo-olefins and WClg and of the ring-opening polymerization of cyclo-olefins is depicted in Fig. 1. The reactants were thoroughly mixed in the chamber 2 at room temperature, and the ESR tube was then filled and introduced into the ESR cavity. The catalyst components were added to the cyclo-olefin in the following order: WC4, epichlorohydrin, i-Bu3Al. Before addition of the i-Bu3Al solution the reaction mixture was cooled to 80 C, following which the contents of chamber 2 were quickly transferred to the ESR tube and the spectrum recorded. ESR signals arising from the interaction between WClg and cyclo-olefins were only observed after a contact time >10 min (with cyclohexene and cyclododecene, the signals appeared after 102 and 103 min, respectively). Results and discussion Interaction between WCl(, and cyclo-olefins When WClfi was contacted with cyclopentene at room temperature the resulting red solution exhibited an ESR signal after 40 min with a^-factor of 353 g=1918 Fig. 1. Apparatus for ESR measurements: 1, ESR tube; 2, mixing chamber; 3, magnetic striker; 4, vial containing WClg; 5, vial containing i-Bu3Al; 6, vial containing epichloro- hydrin. Fig. 2. Evolution with time of the ESR signals recorded during the interaction of WCle with cyclopentene: 1, over the period 40 - 100 min; 2, over the period 100 - 1000 min; 3, at times >4 X 103 min. 1.918 0.004 and hyperfine splitting a^ = 70 G (Fig. 2). The hyperfine structure was not completely resolved. This signal was assigned to a W(V) species arising from the reduction of WCl6 by cyclopentene. The amplitude of the signal increased with time reaching a maximum after 200 min. The same W(V) ESR signal was observed during the interaction of WClg with other cyclo-olefins, e.g. cyclohexene, cyclo-octene and cyclododecene. The variation with time of the amplitude of this signal was characteristic for a given cyclo-olefin; higher intensities were observed for cyclopentene and cyclo-octene while the amplitude was always very low for cyclododecene (Fig. 3). After interaction between WC4 and cyclopentene for 4 X 103 min, a second signal with a g-factor of 1.680 0.04 was detected (see Fig. 2). This new signal was attributed to a W(III) species formed by further reduction of the W(V) species by cyclopentene (i.e. beyond the first reduction step). The same W(III) ESR signal (g-factor = 1.70 0.05) was recorded for the green aqueous solution of a reduced tungsten compound resulting from the Zn + HC1 reduction of Na2WC>4, the oxidation state of the tungsten being deter- mined by independent cerium sulphate titration. These aqueous solutions are readily oxidized in air when they revert back rapidly to the initial oxida- tion state. During the interaction of cyclohexene with WCle at room temperature, two distinct ESR signals were recorded (Fig. 4). The first signal (g-factor = 1.910 0.002), which appeared after a contact time of 200 min, was assigned to a W(V) species. The second signal with a g-factor of 2.103 0.002, which 354 Fig. 3.

Evolution with time of the ESR signals arising from the interaction between WClg and cyclohexene: 1, for times <200 min; 2, at times >5 X 103 min for the precipitate; 3, at times >5 X 103 min for the solution; cyclohexene = 15 ml; [WClg] = 0.05 g. was observed with the precipitate after 3 d, could not be assigned precisely because of the complexity of the spectrum; it may be assigned tentatively either to a W(V) species in the solid or to an adsorbed hydrocarbon radical. However, the non-appearance of a W(III) signal in the spectrum even after a longer reaction time r (1 X 103 min < T < 1 X 104 min) should be noted. A significant amount of the W(V) species arises during the interaction of cyclo-octene with WCl6 at room temperature. The maximum amplitude of the corresponding ESR signal was attained after 100 min interaction time. If contact is prolonged (3 X 103 min < r < 2 X 104 min), the concentration of this W(V) species diminishes but no W(III) species (nor any other paramag- netic species) were detected. 855 In contrast to the above-mentioned cyclo-olefins, cyclododecene inter- acts with WClg at room temperature to give only small amounts of a W(V) species which could be detected after 1 X 103 min. The W(III) species was again not observed, even after long interaction times (3 X 103 min). Interaction of cyclo-olefins with WClybased catalysts The ring-opening polymerization of cyclopentene initiated by the WClg/ epichlorohydrin/i-Bu3Al system has been followed by ESR spectroscopy at room temperature either under dry argon or in high vacuum (10~3 torr). Under dry argon only one ESR signal was recorded with a g-factor of 2.0048, AH = 13 G; the occurrence of this signal has been reported earlier for this system [ 1 ]. In high vacuum the ESR spectrum showed three distinct signals (Fig. 5). The signals with ^-factors of 1.955 0.005 and 1.730 0.03 were assigned to W(V) and W(III) species, respectively; the signal connected with the W(V) species exhibited a weak hyperfine structure. The signal with ag-factor of 2.019 0.002 was associated with a hydrocarbon radical. The variation with time of the amplitude of these signals is illustrated in Fig. 6. During the first 20 min, the amplitude of the W(III) signal strongly increases and then rapidly decreases as the polymerization progresses. The variation with time of the amplitude of the signal with a g-factor of 1.955 assigned to the W(V) species supports the rapid reduction of the W(V) Fig, 5. ESR spectra recorded during the ring-opening polymerization of cyclopentene initiated by the WCls/epichlorohydrin/i-BuaAl system: 1, after 10 min; 2, after 40 min.

Interestingly, the signal with a g-factoi of 2.019 assigned to a hydrocarbon radical increases significantly as the rate of polymerization decreases. The interaction between the same catalytic system and another cyclo- olefin (cyclohexene) has also been followed by ESR spectroscopy at room temperature and under high vacuum. Three characteristic signals were recorded (Fig. 7): the first signal with a g-factor of 1.83 0.02 was assigned to a W(V) species, the second (g = 1.740 0.04) to a W(III) species and the third one (g = 2.007) to a hydrocarbon radical. The resonance of the hydro- carbon radical appears after longer interaction times (r > 102 min) and is a narrow line (AH ~ 11 G). The g-factor of the W(V) species was shifted towards higher field in comparison to other systems, possibly as a result of stronger spin-orbit interaction. The amplitude of these signals decreased dramatically during the first two minutes of interaction, but no polymer formation was observed. The ESR spectrum recorded during the interaction of WCle with i- Bu3Al in toluene as the solvent and in the absence of cyclo-olefin (at room temperature and under high vacuum) showed a multitude of signals (Fig. 8). g=183 Fig. 7.

ESR spectra resulting from the interaction between WClg and i-Bu3.Al in toluene as a solvent in the absence of cyclo-olefin: 1, after 5 min; 2, after 24 h. [WCl^] = 0.08 g; toluene = 15 ml; Al/W = 1.3. 357 Signals with g-values of 1.95 and 1.74, previously assigned to the W(V) and W(III) species, respectively, were found together with other unidentified signals. The latter may be due either to W(V) or W(III) species; thus, the signal with a g-factor of 1.850 may be associated with a W(V) species while the signal with a ^-factor of 1.806 is presumably due either to a W(V) species exhibiting strong spin-orbit interaction or to an adsorbed W(III) species. After interaction for 1 X 103 min a sharp increase in the amplitude of the W(V) signal was noted, while the signal due to W(III) and other unidentified signals could no longer be detected. Conclusions During the interaction of WClg with cyclopentene, paramagnetic species assigned to W(V) and W(III) have been detected by ESR spectroscopy. The same W(V) and W(III) species have been observed during the ring-opening polymerization of cyclopentene initiated by the WClfi/epichlorohydrin/i- Bu3Al system. As polymerization progressed, the amplitude of the W(III) and W(V) signals diminished rapidly. The ESR signal corresponding to the W(V) species was also observed during the interaction of WClg with other cyclo-olefins such as cyclohexene, cyclo-octene and cyclododecene; the variation with time of the amplitude of this signal depends on the nature of the cyclo-olefin. In contrast to cyclo- pentene, no W(III) signal was found for these cyclo-olefins even after long interaction times with WCle. The W(III) signal could only be detected during interaction between cyclohexene and the polymerization catalyst WClg/epi- chlorohydrin/i-Bu3Al, although no polymerization occurred; in addition, a signal assigned to a hydrocarbon radical was also observed in this system after long interaction times. A complex spectrum was recorded when WC4 was interacted with i-Bu3Al in toluene in the absence of cyclo-olefin. In this case signals assigned to the W(V) and W(III) species mentioned above together with other uniden- tified signals were observed. After interaction for 1 X 103 min the amplitude of the W(V) signal increased while the other signals could no longer be detected. References 1 A. M. Shapiro, Yu. V. Korshak. M. A.
