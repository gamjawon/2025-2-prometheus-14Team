Graphical abstract Highlights ► Knowledge on the Mn–Na2WO4/SiO2 was summarized and critically reviewed. ► Stability of the catalyst is proven, which is important because many catalysts deactivate. ► Variations of the content were studied, but, variations of the support are missing in literature. Mn–Na2WO4/SiO2 is one of the very few catalysts for the oxidative coupling of methane, whose stability over extended times on stream has been reported by different research groups. The high stability turned Mn–Na2WO4/SiO2 into an object of research, despite the rather complex composition and structure. The nature of the active site or the active phase is unclear, in spite of the research on this catalytic system. This manuscript tries to critically summarize the literature on this system and to discuss the available information about the relationship of structure and activity.

Currently, natural gas is underutilized, as there are no feasible ways to convert large amounts of CH4, the main component of natural gas, into value added products [2]. The oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to C2H6 or C2H4 is a possible reaction (see Eq. (1)), which has received a lot of attention since the fundamental works of Keller et al. [3] and Hinsen et al. [4]. (1) CH 4 + 1 2 O 2 → C 2 H 6 or C 2 H 4 + H 2 O The reasons are, that the oxidative coupling of methane is a direct and exothermic process, therefore not limited by any thermodynamic constraints. Moreover, the products are C2 compounds, a vital building block in the chemical industry with an expectedly increasing demand. However, until now no economically viable process has been put into practice despite all efforts [5–9]. The reasons are a lack of active, selective and in particular stable catalysts. Furthermore, the thermodynamically favored reaction is the total oxidation of CH4, as shown in Eq. (2). (2) CH 4 + 2 O 2 → CO 2 + 2 H 2 O In the search for a suitable catalyst, hundreds of materials have been tested in the past [6,5]. The stability of possible OCM catalysts was often not reported and it is therefore doubtful in many publications. A prominent example is Li/MgO: in many publications it was either reported to be a stable catalyst or information and experiments on the stability were neglected [10,11], and references therein. Recently, it has been shown that Li/MgO suffers from an intrinsic instability, prohibiting any practical application [10,12]. The Mn–Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst was first reported by the group of Li [13,14], unfortunately these two publications are in Chinese. However, this catalyst has a remarkable stability under the high temperatures required for the oxidative coupling of methane. This fact has been confirmed by different research groups [15–19]. Moreover, the catalytic performance (CH4 conversions of 20–30% at C2 selectivities of 70–80%) is suitable for a practical application. Since Mn–Na2WO4/SiO2 is one of the very few suitable OCM catalysts, the existing literature is summarized in this manuscript with focus on the structure-activity relationship, completing and updating two review articles from the catalyst's inventor Prof.Li from 2001 and 2003, respectively [20,21]. The main aim of this manuscript is to critically summarize and discuss the published results, contributing to unraveling the structure-activity relationship, pointing out weaknesses and possibilities for further improvements and additional research. 2 Preparation In their first publications on this catalyst system, Li et al. reported two preparation procedures: physical mixing and wet impregnation. The wet impregnation procedure was reported to result in a more stable catalyst [13,14]. In the majority of publications, the Mn–Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst has been prepared via an incipient wetness impregnation method. However, this procedure leads to an enrichment of the active components on or near the catalyst surface, which could result in a loss of active component during long times on stream. Therefore, Li et al. investigated the effect of different preparation procedures (incipient wetness impregnation, mixed slurry and sol–gel) for the Mn–Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst [22]. XRD experiments revealed that the basic structure was the same for the three preparation methods, with the main phases Mn2O3, Na2WO4 and highly crystalline α-cristobalite, despite different precursors. The XPS (X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy) and TPD (Temperature Programmed Desorption) results were consistent. However, it was reported that for the impregnation method, the components Mn, Na and W were mainly found on the surface, while for the other two methods, the elements were equally distributed between bulk and surface. The catalytic performance and stability for the incipient wetness and the mixed slurry preparation is comparable, however, the CH4 and O2 conversion, not the C2 selectivity, for the sol–gel method was considerably less compared to the other two methods. This might be due to lower amounts of active material on the surface, however, the surface composition determined via XPS does not support this assumption, because the catalyst prepared by mixed slurry has a similar surface composition but a higher catalytic performance. Stability tests for extended times on stream showed that the mixed slurry preparation diminished the loss of active components, providing a very good stability. A variation of the composition was studied in detail [23] and it was found that within a relatively broad range (obviously depending on the point of view) a large variation of the composition is possible: 1. Na 0.4–2.3wt% 2. W 2.2–8.9wt% 3. Mn 0.5–3.0wt% without major changes of the resulting catalytic activity. Simon and co-workers showed that a scaled up preparation of this catalyst using fluidized bed processing, is possible [17], which is crucible for any practical application. The catalysts prepared in the cited publications have been prepared either by incipient wetness or by a slurry mixture. It is stated if other procedures were used. 3 Stability Li and co-workers studied the Mn–Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst in a 200ml fluidized-bed reactor, containing 130g catalyst, for 450h time on stream at a temperature of 800–875°C [16]. A relatively constant performance was observed under the applied reaction conditions. Similar investigations were reported in a fixed-bed reactor by the same group [15]. The investigated times on stream were 500 and 1000h. Again, a relatively constant performance was reported. Similar results have been reported by other researchers, however, for much shorter times on stream (15–100h) [17–19]. Therefore, this catalytic system can be considered as stable under the applied reaction conditions. 4 Structure activity relationship In the first two studies, published in Chinese, on this system [13,14], it was reported that a Na2WO4 and a Mn2O3 phase existed and a phase transition from amorphous SiO2 to α-cristobalite occurred. This phase transition was confirmed by nearly all research groups, investigating this catalytic system. In the first English publication, this group reported on the oxide support interaction and the surface reconstruction of Mn–Na2WO4/SiO2 [24]. Keeping the content of Mn fixed at 1.9wt% and varying the content of Na2WO4, it was found that the maximum OCM activity was obtained at 4wt% Na2WO4. Higher loadings of Na2WO4 did not further increase the activity, suggesting that the catalytic performance is closely related to the state of the dispersed Na2WO4 on the surface. Mn/SiO2 was found to be an active OCM catalyst itself, which is in accord with previous studies [25,26]. However, for Mn/SiO2 no phase transition of SiO2 was observed, suggesting that the SiO2 remained amorphous. The addition of Na2WO4-loadings higher than 1wt% to amorphous SiO2 and subsequent calcination at 750–850°C did result in a phase transition to α-cristobalite. At a loading of 4wt% Na2WO4, the phase transition occurred completely, concomitantly with a strong reduction of surface area. However, loadings higher than 4wt% Na2WO4 led to a separate, crystalline Na2WO4 phase, detected with XRD (X-Ray Diffraction). The same results were observed for Mn–Na2WO4 on SiO2. However, a separate Mn2O3 phase was detected with XRD at loadings of Na2WO4 as low as 1wt%. Manganese silicate and quartz was also found to be present. A surface reconstruction was assumed and the formation of a surface cluster species of tetrahedral WO4 species with one WO bond and three WOSi bonds was reported to be demonstrated and presumed to be the active site. DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations for WO4 species on the (111) surface of α-cristobalite showed tetrahedral WO4 species with either one or three bridging oxygen atoms and the Mn interacts with a single oxygen bridge forming either dispersed MnO4 or it exists as oxide clusters [27]. Due to the nature of the molecular orbitals and the electronic structure, it was suggested that the tetrahedral WO4 species with a single bridging oxygen are the active site. Crystalline Na2WO4 has a spinel structure with a tetrahedral symmetry [28,29]. Li et al. showed with Raman spectroscopy that in Na2WO4/SiO2, the tetrahedral WO4 is distorted, most probably due to the presence of Na [30]. The distorted WO4 could be the active phase. In a follow up publication to the 450h time on stream experiment [16], XAFS (X-ray Absorption Fine Structure) and XPS characterization of this catalyst after preparation and after 100h and 450h time on stream was reported [31]. The cited reference (No.9: X. Wang and S. Li. Shiyou Huagong 26 (1997), p. 381.) does not exist. Assuming a writing mistake, Ref. [16] could have been meant. But in this case, the reported reaction conditions in [31] of a feed gas composition: CH4:O2:H2O = 6:1:3 cannot be retraced. Howsoever, in the fresh catalyst an oxygen-enriched amorphous phase was reported to be found, consisting of discretely distributed tetrahedral WO4 and octahedral MnO6. Moreover, it was reported that the observed bond lengths were fully identical to Na2WO4 and Mn2O3. In the spent catalyst, nearly no tungsten species were detectable in the surface. The authors assumed that the harsh reaction conditions in the fluidized bed reactor had enhanced the loss of tungsten, being only weakly bound to the surface. However, highly dispersed MnO4 groups were found, tetrahedral and coordinatively unsaturated octahedral ones. They proposed that a combination of tetrahedral and octahedral sites, with different oxidation states, were responsible for the catalytic activity and surface oxygen species, preactivated by lattice oxygen, were responsible for the high activity. Unfortunately, it was not mentioned if or how a background correction was made and if inhomogeneous charging occurred in the XPS measurements. The strong reduction of the near surface concentration of the different components is remarkable, especially since it does not occur equally for all components. A strong reduction of the yield was not observed. Thus, it is unclear how much of the catalytically active material is actually necessary. That almost no tungsten species were found in the spent catalyst raises further doubts if W is part of the active center, particularly with regard to other researchers suggesting a Na–O–Mn species as the active center [32]. Lambert et al. studied Mn, Na and W supported on SiO2 alone and/or in combination [33]. The catalytic data for the different possible combinations of the active components are shown in Table 1 . It was reported that amorphous SiO2 underwent a phase transition to highly crystalline α-cristobalite. This was reported as remarkable, because it occurred during calcination at 750°C, which was far below the normal transition temperature of 1500°C. This is in agreement with the results of other researchers [13,34,17]. Experiments with Mn/SiO2 and W/SiO2 showed that neither of these two elements were able to induce this change. Na, especially in the presence of W, was reported to be responsible for this phase transition. The explanation of the phase transition of SiO2 in the presence of Na was later given by Mazzara et al. [35]. Na–W/SiO2 is a good catalyst, with a decreased C2 selectivity (in accord with Li et al. [30]). Mn–W/SiO2 is an unselective catalyst. Mn/SiO2 was reported to be a rather unselective catalyst and W/SiO2 was even worse. Amorphous SiO2, with and without Na, is basically a total oxidation catalyst. After the phase transition to α-cristobalite, the material can be considered as inert. Based on these results, it was concluded that strong synergies are present between these three metal oxides and a Na-induced crystallization of the support material occurs, converting it from an active and unselective material into an inert support. Furthermore, α-cristobalite, produced during phase transition, was superior to α-cristobalite used as starting material, indicating that dispersing and stabilizing tungsten surface species, possibly WO4, has a positive influence. However, the exact species remain unclear. In their study on the different preparation procedures [22], Li et al. noted, but did not shown, that the structure change to α-cristobalite, which is considered to be important by many other researchers [33], might not always be necessary for a good performance. Since WO4 is Raman active [36], Raman and EPR (Electron Paramagnetic Resonance) spectroscopy studies were performed to investigate the activation of O2 [34]. It was reported that in the presence of gas phase O2, F-centers (an oxygen ion vacancy with two trapped electrons) exist on the surface of the reduced catalyst, which are able to activate molecular O2 above 80°C, forming lattice oxygen, which is involved in the catalytic reaction. Pulse experiments without gas phase O2 showed significant CH4 conversion, declining with the pulse number. Since previous O2-TPD experiments on Mn–Na2WO4/SiO2 did not show any desorption peaks until 800°C [13,14], it was concluded that surface lattice oxygen may be involved as the active oxygen species. The dynamics of the Mn–Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst was investigated by Salehoun and co-workers using transient experiments [37]. It was reported that the catalyst has stable redox properties and provides its lattice oxygen for the reaction, which is in accord to the results of [34]. C2 and CO x products are formed in the absence of gas phase O2, these results are not in agreement with the findings of Lunsford and co-workers [32]. The catalyst regained nearly its full activity upon re-oxidation. A deactivation was not observed. Bhatia and co-workers observed a deactivation under their applied reaction conditions [38,39], which could be dealt with by regenerating the catalyst under an oxygen flow. In a subsequent publication, they investigated the reasons for the observed deactivation [39]. A loss of active components was considered to be one of the reasons for the deactivation, another one could be the observed transition of α-cristobalite to quartz. The deactivation could be due to the CH4/O2 ratio of 7, which was higher than in many other publications. However, in this case, the deactivation could also be caused by a change in the catalyst structure, but this was not considered. Simon et al. performed a characterization and confirmed the transition of amorphous SiO2 into α-cristobalite [17]; the catalyst was prepared by fluidized bed processing. The analysis of the catalyst after the reaction indicated a phase transition of Mn2O3 to MnWO4, implying the reduction of Mn3+ to the more stable Mn2+. Li et al. also reported a distorted WO4 tetrahedron [30], they presumed that a distortion could be due to the presence of Na. EDX (Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy) mapping indicated a diffusion of the Na into the SiO2 support. Studying a variation of the composition, Ji et al. reported that the presence of Na favors the migration of Mn and W to the surface of the catalyst, improving the performance, and the crystallization of the amorphous SiO2 to α-cristobalite. Moreover, it was claimed that the near-surface concentration was found to be directly correlated with the conversion and the selectivity toward C2H4. However, this conclusion seems a little far-fetched, especially regarding that the reaction mechanism is very complex. Active sites were presumed to include Na–O–Mn and Na–O–W species. The Na–O–Mn site would be in accord to Lunsford et al. [32]. At low contents of W, WO4 was tetrahedral and with increasing W content, tetrahedral and octahedral WO6 was present. The first one was reported to be more active. The re-crystallization of SiO2 to α-cristobalite is reported by nearly all research groups and it can be considered as a fact. The presence of separate phases of Na2WO4 and a Mn2O3 can also be considered as proven. The study of Lambert et al. suggests a strong synergetic effect of all three metals, as the absence of either one of them leads to an inferior catalytic performance. However, this does not give any indication of the composition of the active site. Moreover, Simon et al. and Hou et al. reported the presence of MnWO4, a phase which could very well be present on the catalyst. But it has hardly been investigated or considered in literature if this phase is the active one. 5 Active center and reaction mechanism Li et al. showed in a study [24], that a surface reconstruction can be assumed, together with the formation of surface cluster species of tetrahedral WO4 species, with one WO bond and three WOSi bonds, which have been assumed as the active site. This assumption is in accord with a later DFT-study [27]. However, it was shown later, that the tetrahedral WO4 species are distorted [30] and the distortion is responsible for the activity. Based on the results of EPR and Raman experiments, a redox mechanism involving a W6+/W4+ couple with WOSi bonds was suggested [34], as presented in Fig. 1 . Gas phase O2 was assumed to be involved in the electron transfer from the W to the vacancy, forming the F-center. The role of Mn was suggested to increase the mobility of surface lattice oxygen. A redox mechanism is plausible, but the proposal as shown in Fig. 1 is too explicit. First of all, the EPR signal assigned to W4+ is very broad and this assignment to the specific oxidation state might not be univocal. Moreover, EPR spectra for W4+ are not known in the literature [40]. W4+ is an integer spin system and due to the high atomic number it should have a high spin-orbit coupling and a strong zero-field splitting. That would be an equivalent behavior to V3+, which is not observed in the X-band [40]. However, EPR spectra of W5+ are known. The assignment of oxidation states for surface species and the derivation of a structure purely based on few results of Raman and EPR spectroscopy is questionable, especially regarding a similar discussion on the structure of Mo and V surface species, where much more experimental data has been published without unraveling the exact structure. F-centers are thermally instable in the presence of oxygen and their stability under the reaction conditions of the OCM is unclear. Moreover, neighboring F-centers, filled with two electrons each, do not appear to be likely under the reaction conditions of the oxidative methane coupling. A further point of critique is that in this publication [34], a redox mechanism for W6+/W4+ is proposed, but in citatory publications and reviews [20], a mechanism of W6+/W5+ is discussed. Li and co-workers proposed a redox mechanism for the generation of methyl radicals from CH4 over Mn–Na2WO4/SiO2 [41]. They reported that the activation of CH4 takes place on W6+ sites and the activation of gas phase O2 on Mn3+ sites. The high activity of the Mn–Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst is thought to be due to the oxygen spillover, from Mn2O3 to the Na2WO4. A two metal site model for this catalyst was proposed, see Fig. 2 , extending the mechanism proposed in Fig. 1. The experimental details of this work can be found in a publication of Jiang et al. proving the production of methyl radicals from CH4 via EPR [42]. The critics on the work is the same than above described. If the reoxidation is not too fast, the detection of Mn2+ should be possible. On the other hand, the life time of W5+ could be rather short, so that detection is not possible. Lunsford et al. compared Mn–Na2WO4/SiO2, Mn–Na2WO4/MgO and NaMnO4/MgO [32]. However, Figure 2 of publication [32] does not display the intended material. The caption discusses activity as function of time on stream for 4 catalysts, while the Figure itself shows the pulse number, an unknown factor and the range for kinetic experiments. Therefore, no catalytic data is shown or discussed for these results in the present manuscript. Due to the identical catalytic performance of all three materials, it was suggested that a common active site, consisting of Na–O–Mn species existed. This is inconsistent with the suggestion of Li, who proposed that the WO bonds of a distorted WO4 tetrahedron could be the active site [13]. Due to a similar performance of Mn–Na2WO4/MgO and NaMnO4/MgO, it was concluded that the active species is the same and W might not be required. Without Mn, the catalytic performance was generally inferior. However, NaMnO4/MgO deactivated and a loss of Na was observed. Therefore, it was concluded that W is necessary for the stability and it was speculated that it prevents loss of Na. NaMnO4/SiO2 was reported to have a bad performance. The XRD patterns are supposed to show that the presence of WO4 prevents the formation of sodium silicates or manganese silicates. It is questionable if this conclusion can be drawn so easily. Pulse experiments showed a significantly lower CH4 conversion as compared to the co-feed modus, concluding that bulk lattice oxygen does not play a major role in the reaction. The XRD patterns showed several different phases, but none of them could be directly associated with the catalytic performance. However, it is questionable if from XRD results, a typical bulk methods, a conclusion can be drawn about the surface composition and the active center on the surface. 6 Variation of composition 6.1 Substitution of Mn The correlation of the electrical conductivity, the catalytic performance and structural features for Na2WO4/SiO2 doped with V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Zn was investigated [43,44]. The idea of this work is based on the findings of Voskresenskaya, who observed that there are direct relationships between bulk properties, surface properties and the performance in the OCM [45]. The conductivity was determined under oxygen and OCM conditions. A clear correlation between the catalytic performance and the conductivity under the OCM conditions was reported to be found. Mn had the highest electrical conductivity and exhibited the best catalytic performance. In Fig. 3 , the reported C2 yield is correlated with the reported conductivity (left) and the natural logarithm of the conductivity (right). However, for the yield plotted against conductivity, there is no distinct correlation. However, their could be an exponential dependency, but for a more significant conclusion, experiments with metals of a conductivity between 1000 σ e /σ d and 4000 σ e /σ d is necessary. A similar experiment with Mn and Ce, respectively, as promoter was also reported [46]. Similar O2 and CH4 activation sites were seen as a result of similar textual, redox and catalytic properties. The oxygen activation properties of Mn, respectively, Ce were limited by the ability of the tungstate to utilize the oxygen species. This is in accord with a publication of Li and co-workers, suggesting that the oxygen spillover from Mn2O3 to the Na2WO4 is important for the enhanced activity of the catalyst. Different Mn-loadings were investigated by Malekzadeh et al. [47]. The onset temperature depended on the CH4/O2 ratio and higher loadings of Mn lowered the onset temperature for the reaction. 6.2 Substitution of Na Li, K, Ba, Ca, Fe, Co, Ni and Al were used as substitutional dopants for Na by Li and co-workers [48]. Unfortunately: this publication reports the activity only after 0.5h or 5h time on stream. Therefore it is not clear if any of the prepared samples deactivated. Modeling of the transition metal complex formed by WO4 tetrahedron and CH4 [48], suggested that the WO4 tetrahedron can have the suitable geometry and energy to activate the CH4. The best performance was obtained with Na and K, which is consistent with the results of Lambert et al. [49]. The stabilization of WO4 tetrahedrons by Na or K, was given as explanation. For other substitutional dopants, octahedral WO6 was found. Moreover, the SiO2 was present as quartz or amorphous SiO2, a phase transition to α-cristobalite was not reported, as observed for Na. Lambert et al. also studied a series of materials, exchanging Na for Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Mg and Ca [49]. Generally, it was found that the Na in Na2WO4/SiO2 could be substituted and the resulting material was still catalytically active. An especially good performance was observed for K and Rb. Phase transition of SiO2 to α-cristobalite was also observed for K and Rb. That the exchange of Na with Li resulted in a bad catalyst is not surprising, because the high mobility of Li and its ability to form lithium silicates is well known [10] (and references therein). Mn–K2WO4/SiO2 and Mn–Rb2WO4/SiO2 were found to be the best OCM catalyst with respect to conversion and selectivity. However, detailed catalytic activity including time on stream experiments for Mn–K2WO4/SiO2, Mn–Na2WO4/SiO2 and Mn–Rb2WO4/SiO2 were not reported, therefore, the stability of the catalysts remains unclear. The improved results for K is in accord to Li et al. [48]. An arising question due to the improved performance of K2WO4/SiO2 and Rb2WO4/SiO2 after the Mn-addition is: what is the actual task of Mn, especially since Mn/SiO2 is an active OCM catalyst itself [25]. Malekzadeh et al. studied Mn–Li2WO4/SiO2 [50] and proposed that α-cristobalite is an intermediate on the reaction path to quartz. Higher Li-loadings lead to an instable catalyst, which is a well known effect of Li [10]. Tyunyaev et al. prepared Mn–Na2WO4/SiO2 via a solid phase technology, substituting Na for K, Rb and Cs, and determined the phase composition with XRD [51]. The oxygen activity was reported to be a consequence of the thermodynamic exchange of impurity alkali cations between the SiO2 polymorphs. Mn and W were reported not to form solid solutions with SiO2, instead acting as non-stoichiometric alkali cation sources. 6.3 Substitution of W In loosely connected experiments, it was shown by Lunsford et al. that W can be exchanged for C, Si, Sn, P, B and S. The resulting material still exhibited OCM activity [52]. Unfortunately, no detailed data on the catalytic activity or characterization was reported. A variation of the W was tried in the Mn–Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst by Mahmoodi et al. [53], the substitutional metal oxides were: Mo, Nb, V and Cr. A phase transition of amorphous SiO2 to α-cristobalite was observed. W showed the best CH4 conversion and C2 selectivity. The second best performance was reported for Mo. Generally, the variation of the conversion was not very strong. However, the selectivity for V and Cr was low. For V, Raman modes were observed for V2O5, which is known to have mainly total oxidation properties. Based on catalyst performance, Raman and IR spectroscopy (infra red) it was concluded that the selective oxidation is done by terminal M=O and bridging MOM bonds (lattice oxygen) and support-metal and metal-metal interactions having nucleophilic nature. Mn2O3 and α-cristobalite were the predominant species, hot-spots led to the formation of quartz. A slow deactivation was reported. Lunsford et al. also observed and investigated hot spots, however, they did not investigate a possible phase transition of the support material [54]. Hou et al. did a similar variation with WO4, MoO4, SO4, PO4, P2O7, CO3 and SiO3 [55]. It is remarkable, that all prepared materials were catalytically active. W and S showed a good performance, Mo and P an intermediate performance. C and Si showed only very little activity, but distinctly higher than the reported gas phase conversion. A drastically lower CH4 conversion was observed for the catalysts without Mn. For the Mn–Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst, the formation of MnWO4 was found, as also reported by Simon et al. [17]. The type of manganese oxide and its oxidation state depended on the type of oxo anion. Mn2O3 species were suggested to be the active site required for the activation of CH4. This would be in according to Lunsford's proposal but in contradiction to Li's one. 6.4 Substitution of support Only a few attempts to study a variation of the support material have been published. Liu et al. reported the successful application of SiC as support material [56]. The resulting catalyst gave a similar performance compared to the catalyst with SiO2. No hot spot formation was observed. Lunsford et al. reported a study of different support materials. The applied support materials were rare earth oxides (La2O3, CeO2, Pr6O11, Nd2O3, Sm2O3, Dy2O3 and Yb2O3) and SiO2 for Na2WO4 as active component [52]. CeO2 and Pr6O11 were mainly total oxidation catalysts. Covered with Na2WO4 they exhibited good C2 selectivities. No bulk compounds were formed, always two discrete phases remained. It is unclear why typical support materials such as Al2O3, TiO2, etc., have not been used in these experiments. Moreover, for some of the support materials, a blank experiment with only support material is missing, which would be interesting, as Sm2O3 and Nd2O3 are known to be excellent catalysts for the OCM. Generally, it is questionable if supporting an active OCM catalyst on a material which is an active OCM catalyst itself, leads to any results, which could significantly increase the knowledge on the supported material, since catalyst and OCM reaction are very complex. 7 Additives Often catalysts are doped with additional elements in order to improve the catalytic performance. Therefore, doping the Mn–Na2WO4/SiO2 was also subject of several investigations. The tested dopants were Sn, Ce and La [57–61]. None of the dopants could substantially improve the catalytic performance nor the understanding of Mn–Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst. Simultaneous doping of Mn–Na2WO4/SiO2 with S, P and Zr was also reported [62,63]; the catalysts were prepared via incipient wetness impregnation, mixed slurry and sol–gel. The resulting material was reported to be stable, but unfortunately the investigated time span was only 12h. Generally it has to be said, that the Mn–Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst is a very complex system itself and our understanding is limited. The application of dopants might increase the catalytic performance however, at the cost of an even more complex system. 8 Chemical engineering 8.1 Kinetic studies Lunsford et al. performed kinetic experiments with Mn–Na2WO4/SiO2 and Mn–Na2WO4/MgO [18]. The temperature in the reactor was measured and it was tried to suppress the formation of hot spots, caused by the high activity, via diluting the catalyst. The impact of the gas phase reaction was minimized via the reactor and the heating geometry. It was found that O2 is necessary for the coupling reaction. The adsorption of O2 was assumed to be endothermic to explain the high activation energies for the CH4 activation (approximately 260–270kJ/mol). The reaction orders for CH4 and O2 were 1 and 0.5, respectively, which is in accord with the reaction as shown in Eq. (1). More activated oxygen could be stored on Mn–Na2WO4/MgO, however, in a later study it was shown to be instable [54]. C2H4 is an intermediate which is further oxidized to CO2 on the surface. This total oxidation was reported to be suppressed by CH4 in the gas phase. It was assumed that Mn–Na2WO4/support catalysts are so highly selective because they hardly interact with methyl radicals. Generally, it needs to be mentioned, that with MgO as support the catalyst deactivated, making the results of kinetic experiments doubtful. Supported on SiO2, it still deactivated, however, at a much slower rate. It remains unclear how, the catalyzed reaction can be investigated, detached from the gas phase reaction. In fact, it would be necessary to first understand the gas phase reaction and then investigate the impact of the catalyst. Later, Lunsford et al. also studied the formation of hot spots in the OCM, using Mn–Na2WO4/SiO2 and Mn–Na2WO4/MgO as catalysts [54]. They were studied in detail because their occurrence severely complicates the interpretation of the measured data. The hot spots occurred at the entrance of the bed and they could be shifted by changing the CH4/O2 ratio. Mn–Na2WO4/MgO deactivated at the active places, consequently, the hot spots shifted toward the end of the catalyst bed. As mentioned above, Mn–Na2WO4/SiO2 remained extensively stable. The reason for the deactivation of Mn–Na2WO4/MgO was assumed to be not sintering, but the migration of Mn into the bulk and the concomitantly formation of Mg6MnO8 phases Chou et al. investigated the influence of pressure [59,64]. The C3 and C4 compounds were formed via coupling of C2 products. Their partial pressures depended on the O2 partial pressure in the feed. At higher partial pressures of O2, they were burnt. Higher pressure had a negative effect on the C2+ selectivities due to a higher reaction rate, which could be compensated by shorter residence time. However, these results were already found by Ekstrom et al. [65]. If the performed experiments are suitable for a kinetic analysis is questionable, because the influence of the reactor material (steel) has not been reported. Moreover, H2 was not detected, in contrast to the works of Ekstrom. Ahari et al. studied the operating parameters (low flow and low temperatures) under elevated pressures [66]. They reported that an increased pressure leads to slightly decreased C2+ selectivities, while the ratio of C2H6/C2H4 and the stability of the catalyst remained unchanged. Adjusting the pressure to a previous value, the catalyst performance of this point was also restored, without hysteresis. Daneshpayeh and co-workers compared the publications of Stansch et al. (La2O3/CaO [67]), Sohrabi et al. (CaTiO3 [68]), Lacombe et al. (La2O3 [69]), Olsbye et al. (BaCO3/La2O n (CO3)3−n (n≤1.5) [70]) and Traykova et al. (La2O3/MgO [71]), presenting a fitting procedure similar to simulated annealing [72,73]. An overview, adapted from [72], of the used reactions for the kinetic modeling is shown in Table 2 . Without O2 no coupling of methane was observed, which is in agreement to other works, and at higher residence times C2H4 was formed from C2H6. The result that combustion played a major role is not surprising. The model proposed by Stansch and Baerns [67], the included reactions are display in Table 2, could be applied for all catalyst, suggesting that for all catalyst the same mechanism prevails. Daneshpayeh and co-workers performed a model discrimination, with the result that the model proposed by Stansch and Baerns [67] was chosen for further considerations. They modified this model by excluding the inhibition of one reaction in the reaction network by CO2. With this modified model a parameter estimation for their data was performed. The result was a new set of parameters which are different from the ones reported by Stansch and Baerns. The problem of the Stansch model is the suppression of the gas phase reaction, because the catalyst might “only” influence or modulate the gas phase reaction. Moreover, the Stansch model is thermodynamically inconsistent. However, it has to be mentioned positively that the authors tried to solve the problems of local minima. Shahri and Alavi proposed a model with 3 primary reactions and 4 subsequent reactions [74], also shown in Table 2. The water gas shift reaction was the only homogeneous reaction and the formation of C2H4 is considered as a subsequent reaction. C2H6, C2H4 and CO were considered to be intermediates. Furthermore, it was shown that the formation rate of CO was increased by the addition of CH4, C2H4 or O2. However, the proposed model resembles the Stansch model and a depiction of the fitted curves is unfortunately missing. Moreover, measuring temperatures outside the reactor seems questionable, because hot spots cannot be excluded, despite feed dilution [54]. Takanabe and Iglesia performed experiments with isotopically labeled reactants in a batch reactor, made of SiO2 [75,76]. It was reported that the OH radicals abstract hydrogen in an irreversible step. An equilibrium of surface and gas phase oxygen exists only at very high O2 partial pressures. The CH bond break is irreversible and kinetically relevant. The formation of OH radicals seems to be the principal duty of the catalyst and the key step. The model is problematic, because it is thermodynamically inconsistent, it does not allow the back reactions and does not consider the influence of oxygen. Moreover, it only describes the isothermically measured data. A more detailed review about the kinetics of the oxidative coupling of methane was recently published by Sinev and co-workers, however, its content goes far beyond the scope of the present manuscript [77]. All publications acquired data under the assumption that gas phase reactions are excluded or can be neglected, even the kinetic model exclude gas phase reactions. However, the oxidative coupling of methane is an example for a heterogeneous–homogeneous reaction, in which the homogeneous gas phase reaction will always play an important role. It is doubtful if such a complex reaction can be described by classical kinetic approaches [11,77–79]. We think that one of the first steps to a suitable kinetic model should be the understanding of the pure gas phase reaction. This is not simple due to many experimental difficulties, such as obtaining values such as the gas phase temperature or a gradientless reactor bed. 8.2 Process engineering There are numbers of publications dealing with the process engineering of the oxidative coupling of methane, applying Mn–Na2WO4/SiO2 as a catalyst [19,38,61,80–91]. These publications are only mentioned here for the sake of completeness, but they are not within the scope of this manuscript. 9 Summary The stability of the Mn–Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst, prepared by incipient wetness, and its performance during long times on stream of approximately 20–30% CH4 conversion at 70–80% C2 selectivity has been reported by almost all researchers. The phase transformation form amorphous SiO2 to the inert α-cristobalite has also been reported by almost all published reports. The fact that α-cristobalite used in the synthesis led to a reduced activity [33] indicates that the dispersion of the active component is an important factor. This is in accord to the reports that beyond a certain loading of Na2WO4 the activity does not increase anymore [24]. The spectroscopic data for the derivation of a structure and a mechanism as described in Fig. 1 is very limited. In addition obvious errors, like EPR spectroscopy of W4+ being used as evidence for the redox couple W6+/W5+ raises doubts about the reliability of the published data. More detailed structural investigations, also using synchrotron radiation for XPS and XAFS measurements, are necessary to understand the surface structure and the active center. Furthermore, additional computational studies could also help to understand the structure, as only one publication on this topic is surely not sufficient. Li et al. proposed a W–O–Si surface cluster, as shown in Fig. 1, as active center. Later, they refined this proposal to a two metal oxide model, shown in Fig. 2. Lunsford investigated Mn–Na2WO4 on SiO2 and MgO and observed a similar performance for both materials. His conclusion was that a common Na–O–Mn site is the active site. Li's suggestion was made without a variation of the support material and Lunsford's suggestion was made without the consideration that Na2WO4/SiO2 is also an active catalyst. The active center might, therefore, be neither for these two. A few research groups report on the formation of MnWO4, as the formation of this compound is reasonable, further research on formation and task of MnWO4 in this catalyst would be desirable. It was tried to unravel the role of the different components of this catalyst via studying different combinations and variations of the composition. The best catalyst performance is only achieved with Mn, Na or K and W are present, which could agree very well with the two metal model as proposed in Fig. 2. A synergistic effect seems to be present. Moreover, it is remarkable, that Mn, Na and W can be substituted for other metals and in case of W also for non-metals, still resulting in an active catalyst. That could be an indication that a certain structure is responsible for the activity. However, Mn–Na2WO4/SiO2 had the best performance and the variation of always only one component usually led to an inferior catalytic performance. A concomitant variation of all three compounds, or at least two, trying to prepare the same structure with different elements seems more promising to lead to a catalyst with a better performance. Detailed variations of the support material with a variety of different materials or the SiO2 precursor are missing in the literature. Therefore, this topic is under current investigation in our laboratory. Moreover, no study has been reported on the activity of Mn–Na2WO4 without support. Experiments with additional doping of the Mn–Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst were also performed. But no significant improvements were achieved at the costs of an even more complex catalytic system, from which no contribution to the fundamental understanding of the OCM and the function of a catalyst in this reaction can be expected. The oxidative coupling of methane consists of the interplay of a heterogeneous and a homogeneous reaction, which are partly very sensitive to the chosen reaction conditions [92]. Therefore, it is doubtful if simple approaches like Langmuir Hinshelwood, Eley Rideal or Mars van Krevelen are suitable models for a description of the mechanism and the kinetics. However, this is a general problem for many studies on the oxidative coupling of methane.
