School of Civil Engineering Inner Mongolia University of Technology Huhhot 010051 PR China Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) offers a promising alternative to the Haber–Bosch process but requires efficient NH4 + electrocatalysts with enhanced performance and selectivity. Although copper-based catalysts have been extensively researched and employed in electrocatalytic NO3RR, the robust adsorption of intermediates and poor hydrolytic association activity of the catalysts result in reduced ammonia selectivity and interference of competing reactions. This study describes a nanoscale CuOx and CoOx coupling catalyst (CuOx/CoOx) with the most suitable ratio and tandem structure. Efficient and highly selective elimination of NO3 − was accomplished through the tandem catalysis of two oxides. Efficient and notably selective elimination of NO3 − was accomplished through the tandem catalysis of the two oxides. The CuOx/CoOx tandem catalyst achieved a NH4 + selectivity of 90.1 %, NH4 + Faraday efficiency of 95.3 % at a NO3 − concentration of 400 mg/L with a cathodic potential of −0.58 V vs. RHE, and showed desirable stability, attributed to the twin lively website synergy and oxygen vacancy defects of the catalyst.

Consequently, devising an effective and environmentally friendly approach for NO3 − removal is urgent and crucial. Conventional NO3 − treatment methods include reverse osmosis, ion exchange, and biological denitrification methods, which involve complex and costly post-treatment methods, usage of large amounts of wastewater, and high energy consumption. Moreover, ammonia (NH3) can be easily extracted from aqueous solutions using regenerative resin or air stripping techniques [2–5]. Transforming NO3 − into less harmful N2 or beneficial products such as NH3 is considered an effective approach for minimizing nitrogen waste and enhancing the nitrogen cycle. NH3 is a crucial raw material in the chemical industry, that is commonly utilized in fertilizer production and chemical synthesis. Additionally, its carbon-free composition and high hydrogen content (17.6 wt %) render it a promising hydrogen energy carrier [6–11]. The industrial production of NH3 predominantly relies on the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process, which requires high temperature and pressure and depends on fossil fuel combustion, resulting in greenhouse gas emissions and pollution issues [12–15]. The electrocatalytic reduction of nitric acid in wastewater to NH3 (NO3RR) utilizing a renewable power source to provide electrons and water as a hydrogen source has garnered considerable attention owing to its low consumption cost, requirement of a mild reaction environment, high efficiency, environmental friendliness, and ease of operation [16–18]. NO3RR reduces the valence state of elemental N from +5 to −3; this is a complex reaction process and requires the participation of eight electrons, in addition to the existence of a strong competing reaction, i.e., hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which leads to low selectivity and Faradaic efficiency (FE) for the production of NH4 + production in the NO3RR [19,20]. To address this issue, it is essential to develop advanced catalysts with improved activity and selectivity for NH4 +. Recent advancements have been achieved in NO3RR research concerning metal catalysts and associated compounds [21–23]. Cu-based materials are highly selective for electrochemical nitrate reduction because of their ability to inhibit the HER [24]. The d-orbital energy level of Cu is similar to that of the LUMO π* molecular orbitals of nitrates [25,26]. Consequently, it demonstrates outstanding catalytic performance in NO3RR, efficiently converting NO3 − to NO2 − through redox reactions without requiring an external potential [25]. The strong adsorption of NO3RR intermediates, such as NO2 − and NO, on the Cu electrode leads to an excessive accumulation of NO2 −, which in turn decreases FENH3 [27,28]. Meanwhile, because *H generation also plays a decisive role in NH3 production in NO3RR, the poor hydrolytic dissociation activity of Cu-based catalysts hinders the complete hydrogenation of NO3 − to NH3 [29]. There are two ways by which the properties of Cu can be improved. One is modifying the intrinsic activity of Cu by forming oxides (e.g., Cu/Cu2O [27,30]), alloys, and heterostructures [31]. Cu/Cu2O/CuO often exhibits a multiphase structure with phase interfaces and abundant oxygen vacancies, which enhance the catalytic performance of Cu-based catalysts [32–35]. The oxygen vacancies in metal oxides can interact strongly with O atoms in nitrate to modulate the catalytic activity and effectively improve the ammonia selectivity and enhance the NO3RR performance [36–38], In addition, Cu+ is responsible for the sequential conversion of NO2 − to NH3. An efficient approach for this conversion involves designing tandem catalysts that facilitate a cascade reaction, where distinct catalytic sites are paired to enhance the conversion of NO3 − to NO2 − and subsequently that of NO2 − to NH3, thus boosting the overall selectivity of NO3RR for NH3. Recently, catalyst systems such as Cu-Co, Cu-Ru, and Ru-Co have been developed, achieving efficient NO3RR with high activity and NH3 Faradaic efficiency. Additionally, Co-based catalysts, such as CoP, Co nanoarrays, and Co3O4 nanoarrays, have shown activity in NO3RR. The activity of CoOx in NO3RR is comparatively low [39]. Thus, integrating CoOx with Cu-based materials could substantially improve NO3RR performance. This study developed CuOx/CoOx tandem catalysts to enhance and equilibrate the conversion of NO3 − to NO2 − and of NO2 − to NH3. The CuOx/CoOx tandem catalyst exhibited higher activity and selectivity in NO3RR than the CuOx catalyst. The tandem catalytic mechanism involves the reduction of NO3 − to NO2 − on the Cu substrate, the indirect transfer of NO2 − via the electrolyte, and the subsequent reduction of NO2 − to NH3 on the Co substrate. The CuOx/CoOx catalyst achieved a NH3 yield rate of 52.54 μmol h −1 cm−2 at a cathodic voltage of −0.58 V vs. RHE, with a Faradaic efficiency of 95.3 %. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Chemicals and materials Copper acetate monohydrate (C4H8CuO5), cobalt acetate tetrahydrate (C4H14CoO8), sodium nitrite (NaNO2), ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), sulfamic acid, phosphoric acid, p-aminobenzenesulfonamide, N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochloride, sodium salicylate, potassium sodium tartrate, sodium nitrite ferrocyanide, sodium hypochlorite (NaClO), potassium nitrate (KNO3), isopropanol (C3H8O), ethanol (C2H5OH), and glycerol (C3H8O3) were sourced from Macklin (Shanghai, China). Hydrochloric acid was purchased from Chengdu Chron Chemicals. 2.2 Synthesis of cuox/coox Copper acetate monohydrate (3 mmol) and a specified amount of cobalt tetrahydrate acetate were dissolved in 30 mL of glycerol solution, stirred for 1 h to form a suspension, heated in a reactor at 180 °C for 1 day. The solution was then subjected to centrifugation, and the resulting solids were washed with ethanol thrice, vacuum-dried at 60 °C overnight, and calcined in a muffle furnace at a rate of 5 °C/min until reaching 350 °C and maintained for 2 h. The samples doped with 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mmol of cobalt tetrahydrate acetate were termed 1-CuOx/CoOx, 2-CuOx/CoOx, 3-CuOx/CoOx, and 4-CuOx/CoOx, respectively. 2.3 Synthesis of 0-CuOx CuOx was synthesized following the same procedure as CuOx/CoOx without cobalt tetrahydrate acetate doping. 2.4 Preparation of the working electrode The ink solution was formulated by dispersing 8 mg of synthesized catalyst powder and 1 mg of acetylene black in 1 mL of a grade 1 water and isopropanol mixture (3:1 v/v), followed by the addition of 40 μL of Nafion solution as a binder, and sonication for 30 min. A catalyst ink solution (50 μL) was evenly applied to a 1 cm² carbon paper and allowed to dry naturally, forming the working electrode. 2.5 Characterization Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a ZEISS Sigma 360 instrument operating at 5 kV. A JEOL JEM-F200 transmission electron microscope (TEM), with high-resolution (HRTEM) and high-angle annular dark-field scanning (HAADF-STEM) capabilities, along with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyses, was utilized at an operating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on the samples. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a Bruker D8 instrument. Data analysis was conducted using Jade 6.5 software. Absorbance was recorded with a TU-1901 spectrophotometer. 2.6 Electrochemical measurements Electrochemical evaluation was conducted at room temperature using a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua, Shanghai) with a three-electrode setup in an H-type electrolyzer separated by a Nafion 117 membrane. A carbon paper loaded with the catalyst, a platinum sheet electrode, and an Ag/AgCl electrode were utilized as the working, auxiliary, and reference electrodes, respectively. The anode cell contained 40 mL of 0.2 M K2SO4 solution without NO3 −, while the cathode cell held 40 mL of K2SO4 solution with 400 mg/L NO3 −. The electrolyte solution was cleaned using Ar of 99.99 % purity at a flow rate of 50 sccm for 30 min before the electroreduction of NO3 − test. Moreover the working electrode was activated using cyclic voltammetry. Subsequently, a constant potential test was conducted for 1 h at a stirring rate of 200 rpm. Potential was determined in relation to the reversible hydrogen electrode using the following equation. E ( RHE ) = E ( Ag / AgCl ) + 0.059 × pH + 0.2046 An initial assessment of the electrochemical performance of NO3RR was conducted through linear scanning voltammetry (LSV). Cyclic voltammetric curves were recorded within a potential range of −0.32 to −0.42 V vs. RHE, using scan rates between 40 and 140 mV s −1. The performance of NO3RR, including FE, NH4 + selectivity, and yield rate, was examined via the timed-current method at different potentials. The main electrocatalytic properties of NO3RR were subsequently evaluated using ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy after 1 h of continuous electrolytic reduction (Fig. S1). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Reparation and structural characterization of the catalyst CuOx/CoOx catalysts were synthesized by coprecipitation, hydrothermal, and calcination methods as shown in Fig. 1 . Because the amount of cobalt doping affects the morphology, structure and composition of the samples, this was studied in detail (Fig. S2). Among the samples, 3-CuOx/CoOx obtained by adding cobalt acetate tetrahydrate at 0.4 mmol is expected to have a larger electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and higher electrochemical activity. The SEM images in Fig. 2 a–c show that the 3-CuOx/CoOx material has a granular porous morphology with numerous pores on the surface and rough ligaments but uniform internal results. The TEM image is shown in Fig. 2d, and the EDX results are displayed at the upper right corner. The image shows abundant micropores on the surface of the material. Fig. 2e and f present the HRTEM images of 3-CuOx/CoOx, revealing stripe patterns with lattice spacings of 0.208, 0.253, and 0.301 nm, corresponding to the Cu(111), CuO(002), and Cu2O(110) surfaces, respectively, and stripe patterns with lattice spacings of 0.262 and 0.232 nm, corresponding to the CoO (111) and Co2O3 (102) surfaces, respectively. This also proves that the Co in the catalyst is in the oxide form. The multiphase structure and phase interfaces of the sample are also shown. It can effectively promote the movement of electrons and the production of the intermediate *NOH while suppressing the HER, thus improving the NH4 + selectivity and FE [40]. Fig. 2g presents the HAADF-STEM image alongside its EELS elemental mapping. The analysis indicates a uniform distribution of the Cu, Co, and O elements in 3-CuOx/CoOx. The crystal structure of the prepared tandem catalyst 3-CuOx/CoOx was characterized via XRD (Fig. 3 a), showing the coexistence of the Cu, Cu2O, and CuO phases, consistent with the HRTEM and electron diffraction analysis findings. The 2Theta peaks at 43.317, 50.449, and 74.126 for 3-CuOx/CoOx corresponded to the (111), (200), and (220) crystal planes of Cu, respectively, as per PDF#04–0836. The peaks at 2Theta values of 35.555, 38.75, and 48.751 correspond to the (−111), (111), and (−202) crystal planes of CuO, respectively, as per PDF#05–0667. The peaks located at 2Theta of 29.568, 36.424, 42.308, 61.376, 73.518, and 77.378 corresponded to the (110), (111), (200), (221), (311), and (222) crystallographic facets of Cu2O (PDF#05–0667), respectively. The XRD spectra analyses of the samples with different CoOx concentrations (Fig. 3a) revealed that as CoOx concentration increased, the characteristic peaks of Cu diminished and those of Cu2O became more pronounced. This confirmed the successful preparation of the CuOx/CoOx tandem catalyst. Furthermore, the Cu2O peaks of 3-CuOx/CoOx were sharper than those of the other catalysts, indicating that the prepared samples exhibited smaller Cu2O grains and better crystallinity. XPS analysis was performed to determine the elemental composition and valence bands of the catalysts. Fig. 3b illustrates the XPS spectra analyses of 3-CuOx/CoOx and 0-CuOx, which were then further analyzed using the XPSPEAK41 peak software. Fig. 3e demonstrates the successful of tandem of CoOx with CuOx in 3-CuOx/CoOx. As shown in the Cu 2p spectrum of in Fig. 3c, the two fitted peaks with binding energies of 932.48 and 952.45 eV belong to the Cu+&Cu0 mixture, and those at 954.5 (Cu 2p1/2) and 934.2 eV (Cu 2p3/2) belong to the characteristic peaks of Cu2+. Three peaks at 941.40, 943.85 and 962.00 eV also appeared, which belong to the satellite peaks of Cu2+ [41]. Compared with the fitted peaks of Cu+&Cu0 mixture of 0-CuOx (932.56 and 952.86 eV) and Cu2+ peaks (955.19 eV) (Fig. S3), the Cu+&Cu0 peaks and the Cu2+ peaks in 3-CuOx/CoOx were negatively shifted, suggesting that the tandem connection of CoOx facilitates the electron transfer and the regulation of the center of the Cu d-band [42]. Fig. 3d shows that the Cu+ Auger peak is at 920.1 eV and the weak Cu2+ (918.1 eV) and Cu0 (917.1 eV) Auger peaks, indicating that the surface of 3-CuOx/CoOx primarily contains the oxidized states of Cu2+ and Cu+, where the presence of Cu2O can effectively improve the NO3RR electrocatalytic activity and NH3 selectivity [43]. As can be seen in Fig. 3e, the two peaks located at 783.3 and 798.4 eV belong to Co2+ 2p3/2 and Co2+ 2p1/2, respectively. The two peaks located at 780.1 and 794.3 eV belong to the characteristic peaks of Co3+. The peaks at 788.43 and 806.32 eV are the satellite peaks of Co2+. Fig. 3f displays the fitted peaks of O 1 s, with characteristic peaks at 529.87, 531.70, and 533.36 eV, corresponding to lattice oxygen, oxygen vacancies, and surface-adsorbed oxygen, respectively [44,45]. The oxygen vacancy peak areas indicate the presence of abundant oxygen vacancies in 3-CuOx/CoOx. Oxygen vacancies serve as active sites, enhancing the electrocatalytic performance of the catalysts. 3.2 Electrocatalytic performance of electrodes for NO3RR First, the catalytic activity of 0-CuOx/and CuOx/CoOx was studied through LSV experiments, indicating a notable difference in the current densities of the materials (Fig. S4). Meanwhile, the NO3RR activity of the 3-CuOx/CoOx catalysts was initially evaluated via LSV in 0.2 M K2SO4 electrolyte with and without NO3 −. The addition of 400 mg/L NO3 − to the electrolyte notably increased the current density, underscoring the distinct catalytic activity of 3-CuOx/CoOx in NO3RR, as shown in Fig. 4 a. The LSV curves exhibited a reduction peak between −0.6 and −0.4 V vs. RHE, indicating the reduction of copper oxides on the electrode surface. The corresponding i–t curves for different cathodic potentials of 3-CuOx/CoOx are displayed in Fig. S5. Fig. 4b illustrates the NO3RR catalytic performance of 3-CuOx/CoOx across various reduction potentials. The NH4 + selectivity and FE exhibited a parabolic trend between −0.38 and −0.88 V vs. RHE, peaking at −0.58 V vs. RHE with values of 90.1 % and 95.3 %, respectively. The decrease was attributed to the gradual dominance of HER competition at high potentials (Fig. 4c), while NO2 − byproducts were considerably suppressed with voltage enhancement (Fig. S6). Therefore, the optimum reduction potential of NH3–N was considered to be −0.58 V vs. RHE. The selected working potential was −0.58 V vs. RHE for the subsequent electrochemical tests. After preliminary evaluation, the electrocatalytic activity of 3-CuOx/CoOx in NO3RR was found to be better than that of many reported catalysts (Table 1 ). To determine the optimal amount of CoOx in tandem, the NO3RR electrocatalytic performance of the five materials under different CoOx tandems was determined. Fig. 4d illustrates that the FE of CuOx/CoOx initially increases and subsequently decreases with increasing CoOx concentration, whereas NH4 + selectivity consistently improves. The optimal CoOx concentration is 0. 4 mmol, corresponding to the 3-CuOx/CoOx configuration. Next, the electrocatalytic NO3RR performance of 3-CuOx/CoOx was tested at different NO3 − concentrations. Fig. 4g illustrates the NH4 + selectivities and FEs of 3-CuOx/CoOx across NO3 − concentrations ranging from 100 to 2000 mg/L. TThe 3-CuOx/CoOx catalyst demonstrated high NH4 + selectivities and FEs across various NO3 − concentrations. At 2000 mg/L NO3 −, the NH4 + selectivity and FE were 81.46 % and 93.02 %, respectively. Similarly, at 100 mg/L NO3 −, these values were 94.60 % and 90.78 %, respectively, indicating the excellent electrocatalytic NO3RR performance of the catalyst over a broad range of NO3 − concentrations. Electrochemical tests were conducted to thoroughly assess the NO3RR electrocatalytic capability of 3-CuOx/CoOx. In Fig. 4f, 3-CuOx/CoOx achieves the highest NH3 yield rate (52.54 μmol h −1 cm−2) compared with 0-CuOx (37.37 μmol h −1 cm−2), 1-CuOx/CoOx (48.44 μmol h −1 cm−2), 2-CuOx/CoOx (50.14 μmol h −1 cm−2), and 4-CuOx/CoOx (45.47 μmol h −1 cm−2). This superior catalytic performance is attributed to its larger electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and reduced charge transfer resistance, which potentially increase catalytically active sites and facilitate charge transfer. The enhanced performance of 3-CuOx/CoOx over 0-CuOx indicates that the tandem interaction between CoOx and Cu2O likely plays a major role in enhancing the selectivity of CuOx/CoOx for electrocatalytic NO3RR. Additionally, Fig. 4e shows the distribution of the catalytic products of the different catalysts, demonstrating the tandem connection of CoOx, which effectively reduced the generation of NO2 byproducts while increasing the NH4 + selectivity. The excellent NO3RR performance of 3-CuOx/CoOx was further demonstrated. The intrinsic activity of CuOx/CoOx was investigated by measuring the ECSAs of the catalysts through electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl; Fig. S7). The Cdl value of 3-CuOx/CoOx was 441.7 μF cm−2, which was superior to those of 0-CuOx (378.0 μF cm−2), 1-CuOx/CoOx (415.3 μF cm−2), 2-CuOx/CoOx (426.3 μF cm−2), and 4-CuOx/CoOx (406.9 μF cm−2), indicating that 3-CuOx/CoOx exhibited a larger ECSA and could provide more active sites for electrocatalytic NO3RR. The Tafel slopes of 3-CuOx/CoOx were smaller than those of 1-CuOx/CoOx, 2-CuOx/CoOx, 4-CuOx/CoOx, and 0-CuOx (Fig. S8), suggesting that 3-CuOx/CoOx had a faster kinetic process. The long-term electrochemical stability of the a catalyst is also an important performance indicator; hence, the stability of 3-CuOx/CoOx was investigated by continuous testing at −0.58 V for 1 h per cycle. As shown in Fig. 4h, after seven consecutive cycling tests, there was almost no obvious decay in the FE and only a slight decrease in the NH3 yield rate. Meanwhile, the FE of NO2 − generation remained low throughout the stability tests (Fig. 4i). In addition, the catalyst material was characterized after the stability tests (Figs. S9–S11). The overall morphological characteristics and multiphase interfaces of the catalysts did not change significantly, while the XPS results indicated that the amount of oxygen vacancies did not decrease after the tests, while those of Cu and Co in various valence states remained stable. The abovementioned results indicate that 3-CuOx/CoOx exhibits strong catalytic stability for NO3RR. To identify the nitrogen source and exclude environmental influences, we conducted a comparative experiment (Fig. S12) to determine the nitrogen generated in NO3RR. These results indicate that tandem catalysis can lead to superior NO3RR activity. 3.3 Mechanism discussion The NO3RR activity of 3-CuOx/CoOx is primarily influenced by the formation of tandem catalysis and the multiple crystallographic and oxygen vacancies of CuOx. CuOx and CoOx possess distinct catalytic sites that facilitate the conversion of NO3 − to NO2 − and of NO2 − to NH3, respectively. The *NO2 intermediate notably enhances catalytic activity as it transitions through the Cu+ and CoOx sites. Meanwhile, the abundant CuOx crystal surfaces effectively promote the movement of electrons and the generation of the intermediate *NOH to inhibit the HER, thus improving the NH4 + selectivity and FE. Additionally, the oxygen vacancies formed by the multiphase structure of the material modulate the crystal structure and surface electronic structure, lower the activation energy barrier, and regulate the adsorption of NO3 −, which is conducive to further improving the NO3RR performance of the catalyst. 4 Conclusions A CuOx/CoOx tandem catalyst with oxygen vacancy defects was synthesized through the coprecipitation and calcination methods, serving as an effective electrocatalyst for ammonia synthesis. At a concentration of 400 mg/L NO3 − and −0.58 V vs. RHE, the NH4 + selectivity, NH4 + FE, and NH3 yield rate of NO3RR were 90.1 %, 95.3 %, and 52.54 μmol h −1 cm−2, respectively. The 3-CuOx/CoOx catalyst demonstrated excellent cycling stability, maintaining consistent electrocatalytic NO3RR performance over seven cycles. The series-connected CoOx effectively reduced the production of NO2 − byproducts and accelerated the conversion of NO2 − to NH3, thus exhibiting excellent catalytic performance for NO3RR.

        "dc:description": "Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) offers a promising alternative to the Haber–Bosch process but requires efficient NH4 + electrocatalysts with enhanced performance and selectivity. Although copper-based catalysts have been extensively researched and employed in electrocatalytic NO3RR, the robust adsorption of intermediates and poor hydrolytic association activity of the catalysts result in reduced ammonia selectivity and interference of competing reactions. This study describes a nanoscale CuOx and CoOx coupling catalyst (CuOx/CoOx) with the most suitable ratio and tandem structure. Efficient and highly selective elimination of NO3 − was accomplished through the tandem catalysis of two oxides. Efficient and notably selective elimination of NO3 − was accomplished through the tandem catalysis of the two oxides. The CuOx/CoOx tandem catalyst achieved a NH4 + selectivity of 90.1 %, NH4 + Faraday efficiency of 95.3 % at a NO3 − concentration of 400 mg/L with a cathodic potential of −0.58 V vs. RHE, and showed desirable stability, attributed to the twin lively website synergy and oxygen vacancy defects of the catalyst.",
