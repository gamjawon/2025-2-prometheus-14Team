B. Lapina, V. M. Mastikhin, L. G. Simonova and Yu.O. Bulgakova Institute of Catalysis of the Siberian Branch of USSR Academy of Sciences, 630090 Novosibirsk (U.S.S.R.) (Received January 2, 1991; accepted January 25, 1991) Abstract b' V NMR spectra were used for the study of the interaction between vanadium oxocomplexes in solution and the A1203 surface, and for the identification of surface vanadium species formed over A1203 surface for different preparation conditions (pH, concentration of supported V, treatment temperature). At low vanadium concentration, mainly isolated tetrahedral surface complexes are formed over the A1203 surface, bound with one or two bonds. The increase in vanadium concentration results in the formation of surface clusters with a part of the V in a distorted octahedral environment. After treatment at 500 C and at a V concentration of ^-10 wt.%, the formation of AIV04 and VZOb crystals over the A1203 surface takes place. Introduction Catalysts based on vanadia supported on alumina are well known for the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons. The surface vanadium species were characterized by a variety of physical methods. The data obtained with EXAFS [1-3], laser Raman spectroscopy [4-6], electron microscopy, radial atom distribution [ 7 ] and ESR [8 ] indicate that different types of vanadium surface species are formed on the A1203 surface. The relative amounts of these species depend on the preparation method. The \"V NMR spectra provide important information concerning the local environment of the 5IV nuclei [9-10]. Recently 51V NMR was applied to the study of V205 A1203 and Vz05-Ti02 catalysts [11, 12, 131. It was shown that chemical interaction of the support with oxovanadate complexes in solution begins at the impregnation step. The structure of the supported species depends on the pH of the impregnating solution. At pH 10 the adsorbed species have tetrahedral symmetry, whereas at pH 4 polyvariadate like species with vanadium in a distorted octahedral environment are formed on the A1203 surface. The study of \"V NMR spectra in high magnetic fields allows one to diminish the effect of the second-order quadrupole effects, and thus to measure more precisely the chemical shift anisotropy parameters which contain the information on the coordination of V atoms [ 10 ]. The use of 0304-5102/91/$3.50 0 1991- Elsevier Sequoia, Lausanne 62 magic angle spinning (MAS) of the samples, resulting in a narrowing of the resonance lines, provides additional important information concerning the isotropic chemical shifts. The aim of this work is to study, using 51V NMR at 105.2 MHz including MAS experiments, the formation of oxovanadium complexes on the A1203 surface at all steps of catalyst preparation in the range of V concentrations from 1 to 14 wt.%. Experimental The catalyst samples were prepared by impregnation of y-M203 (SSp = 200 m2 g 1, VOre = 0.9 cm3 g-1) with a solution of ammonium metavanadate either in water at pH 7 (series 1) or in 10% aqueous ammonia solution at pH 12 (series 2), or in an aqueous solution of vanadyl oxalate (series 3) at pH 0.4 and impregnation temperature of 70 C. The samples were then dried at 110 C and calcined in air at 500 C. One impregnation of A1203 with solution containing 5.6 wt.% V resulted in 19'0 of supported V. To obtain larger surface V concentrations, more concentrated metavanadate solutions (12 wtA V) were used. Several successive impregnations were also used with intermediate calcination of samples at 400 C. One impregnation was used for solutions of vanadyl oxalate because solubility of the latter is considerably larger than that of ammonium metavanadate. The V concentrations in solutions and in the supported samples were measured by photocalorimetry with the use of hydrogen peroxide. The 51V NMR spectra were measured using a Bruker MSL-400 spectrometer (magnetic field 9.39 T) at 105.2 MHz in the frequency range 250 kHz. 1 As radiofrequency pulses were used to excite the -#-j transition in solid samples. The pulse repetition rate was 10 Hz. Magic angle spinning was performed at a rotation frequency of 4 kHz. 51V NMR spectra of solutions were measured in the frequency range of 50 kHz and with pulse duration 5 ,us. The 51V chemical shifts were measured with respect to external VOCL3. Z7A1 NMR spectra were measured at 104.23 MHz in the frequency range 50 kHz, with pulse duration 5 As and pulse repetition frequency 10 Hz. 'Al NMR chemical shifts were measured with respect to aquacomplex Al(H20)63+ as an external reference. Results Vanadium content in catalysts as a function of preparation method The characteristics of the samples, obtained by the three different preparation methods described above, are collected in Table 1. This table demonstrates the dependence of the V concentration in solutions after impregnation and in the catalyst samples upon the V concentration in the initial solutions and upon the number of impregnation steps (N).

The amount of additionally adsorbed V decreases with each subsequent impregnation step, due to the saturation of the adsorption capacity of A1203, but the total amount of supported V increases on increasing N. In the course of the impregnation, the so-called `free' V is also introduced into the pores of the A1203, precipitating from solution on drying. The amount of `free' V formed after each impregnation step can be calculated if the total volume of pores is known. The data presented in Table 1 show that the relative content of `free' V increases with increasing N. The `free' V may interact with A1203 at elevated temperatures. For ammonium metavanadate dissolved in 10% ammonia solution, a considerable decrease in vanadium concentration in solution takes place after the first impregnation step, with a simultaneous change in pH value from 12 to 10.4, while for subsequent precipitation cycles the decrease in vanadium concentration in solution is much smaller. 64 5'V and \"Al solution spectra The spectra of solutions before and after impregnation of A1203 are represented in Figs. 1 and 2. At pH 12 the anions V043- and V2074- are present in solution [ 141, as indicated by the lines at 8 = - 534 and - 559 ppm (Fig. 1.1). The most pronounced changes in the solutions take place after the first impregnation step (N=1). In such samples the intensity of the lines from V043- and Vz074- decreases. At the same time the line with 8= -571 from V3093- or HZV207 4- appears in the spectrum (Fig. 1.2). At N=2 and N= 3, all three lines at 8 = - 534, - 559 and - 571 ppm are present in the spectra. The spectra at N= 4 are very similar to those in the initial solution. We have found also that the solution remaining after impregnation contains about 0.03 mol 1-1 Al, indicating the dissolution of A1203. This follows directly from the appearance of the signal at 8=80 ppm from A1045- species in the 27AI NMR spectra. The 51 V spectrum of the initial solution at pH 7 exhibits signals at - 5 74 and - 582 ppm from V40124 - and V50155- respectively, signals of low -5n -495 -470 517 5 -557 i LI L3 4 -542 2 -460 -500 -540 -580 -620 PPM -400 -500 -600 PPM Fig. 1. 6'V NMR spectra of the initial impregnation solution, series 2 (NH4V03 and NH40H (pH 12)), with vanadium concentration C =12.3 g 1-' (1) and of the solutions of the series 2 after different numbers (N) of impregnations: N=1 (2), N=2 (3), N=3 (4) and N=4 (5).

The first impregnation (N=1) results in a decrease in intensity of the lines from decavanadate and from V50152- anion (Fig. 2.2). At N=2 the spectrum does not change considerably. At N= 3 and at N= 4, lines from decavanadate appear in the spectrum. No 2'Al signal was found in the solutions at pH 7. For solutions of paramagnetic vanadyl oxalate, no 51 V NMR signals were found due to their large line width. Two 2'Al NMR signals at a= 0 and - 5 ppm from Al in octahedral coordination were found in the solution, due to partial dissolution of A1203. 5'V NMR spectra of wet samples 51V NMR spectra of wet samples obtained at pH 7 and pH 12 are presented in Fig. 3. The sample obtained at N=1 and at pH 12 (Fig. 3B) exhibits an asymmetric spectrum with a peak at 8 = - 545 ppm.

At N=4 the lines at 5 = - 535 ppm and 8 = - 560 ppm from V043- and V207'- anions are present in the spectrum. Figure 3A illustrates the spectra of the samples obtained at pH 7. The first impregnation gives rise to a peak at 8 = - 515 ppm. This peak shifts to higher field as the surface vanadium concentration increases on increasing N. The broad line also appears in the spectra at N> 1. Its intensity increases for N> 2. For N> 2 a line from octahedral V atoms also appears in the spectra (81 = - 350 ppm). The narrow lines in the spectra of the sample with N=4 are due to the `free' vanadium complexes in solution in the A1203 pores. 6'V NMR signals from the wet samples obtained with the use of the vanadyl oxalate solution were not observed, due to the paramagnetism of the supported V species. IT NMR spectra of the dried samples The spectra of the samples dried at 110 C for two preparation series are presented in Fig. 4. For N=1 the spectra have a peak at 8= -520 ppm from V in a distorted tetrahedral environment. For samples with N=2 and pH 7 this peak shifts to a value of - 570 ppm, while for the pH 12 the shape and the position of the NMR spectra remains unchanged. For N= 2, the broader line with 5 near - 750 ppm appears in the spectra for the samples of both preparation series. The V content is larger for the samples prepared at pH 7 compared with that of samples prepared at pH 12, beginning from N> 2 (Table 1). The spectrum from octahedral vanadium (81= - 350 ppm) appears beginning from N> 2. The spectra of the samples prepared at pH 7 for N> 2 have A -750 -350 i -57 0 -520 A q s i -570 3 -750 2 -300 -1000 PPM -500 -1000 PPM Fig. 4. b'V NO spectra of the samples shown in FSg. 3 after drying at 110 C. 67 larger line width and content of octahedral V compared with that for samples prepared at pH 12. sry IVMR spectra of the samples calcined at 500 C The spectra of the samples for three different series of preparation (A = pH 7, B = pH 12, C = from vanadyl oxalate at pH 0.4) after their calcination at 500 C are presented in Fig. 5. The spectra corresponding to lO V content are quite different from those obtained for dried samples. A line with 8= - 750 ppm appears in the spectrum at the expense of the line at - 520 ppm for dried samples of series 1. For samples of series 2 and 3, a line from octahedral V appears (8, = -350 ppm) along with a line with 8= -570 ppm. An increase in V concentration is accompanied by an increase in the widths of the spectral lines compared with those of the dried samples. In all cases the percentage of lines with 81= - 350 ppm (octahedral V) and of the lines with 8= - 750 ppm is larger for samples calcined at 500 C. At V concentrations 10%, the lines became very broad (Fig. 5, A-3, B-3, C-2), but further increase in the amount of V results again in a decrease in line width (Fig. 5, A-4, C3). The spectra of the samples prepared from vanadyl oxalate (Fig. 5C) are broader than the spectra of the samples of series 1 and 2, but the line from .$00 A -660 -580 -,350 PPM s -750 -350 i -590 3 -750 I -600 ppM-1000 -600Ppm -l000 Wig. 5. 6'Y NMR spectra of the samples of the fast (A), of the second (B) and of the third (C) series after calcination at 500 *C.

Figure 6 presents 51V NMR spectra for two samples prepared at pH 12 and having two different V contents (A= 3.8% V, B = 4.8% V), as a function of their thermal treatment. Figure 7 shows the 51V MAS spectra of three samples with three different V contents (8.3, 14 and 14.8%). Discussion The 51V NMR spectra of the solutions obtained after impregnation contain important information on the interaction of dissolved oxovanadium complexes with the A1203 surface. At pH 12 and pH 7 the V anionic species VO43-, V2074 , V3093 , H2V2074 , V40124 r V50155 and V100288 arre present in solution. Their adsorption on the A1203 surface proceeds due to their interaction with the positively charged surface sites, since the anions with the larger negative charge (V2074-, VO43- at pH 12 or V100286- at pH 7) interact first with the surface, as follows from the decrease in their concentration in solution after impregnation at N=1. The decrease in pH upon contact of the solution with A1203 results in the appearance of the anions V3093(8 = - 571 ppm) (at initial pH 12) or in the increase in concentration of decavanadate anions V1oO286- (8=-421, -494, -511 ppm) (at the initial pH 7), in agreement with their larger stability in more acidic solutions [ 14 J. It is well known that the increase in the solution basicity results in a decrease in the amount of species adsorbed on the support surface [6, 71, due to the decrease in the positive charge of the surface. The A1203 surface is neutral at pH 7, but at pH 12 it becomes negatively charged [6, 71. In this case there should be no vanadium adsorption on A1203 at pH 12, which contradicts our experiments. Most probably the necessary positive sites on the surface of A1203 appear as a result of the partial dissolution of A1203. The latter follows directly from the observation of the 27AI NMR signal with 8 = 80 ppm in pH 12 solution or a = - 5 and 0 ppm in vanadyl oxalate solution (pH 0.4) after their contact with A1203. The probable adsorption of NH4+ cations or oxalate anions on the A1203 surface seems to be also important. Both these processes can influence the value of the surface charge and its distribution over A1203 surface, and therefore, influence the adsorption of V species from solution. All variation of the 51V NMR spectra obtained in the experiments with different pH and treatment temperatures can be classified as consisting from the five different types of lines (Fig. 8). The line A (8 = - 520 to - 590 ppm) found in the wet samples at low V content (lO) can be attributed to V atoms in the nearly regular tetrahedral environment. These species are formed after adsorption of V2074- (a= -559 ppm) and VO43- (8 = - 539 ppm) anions. The chemical shift values of adsorbed species change due to their interaction with the A1203 surface, as well as 70 E j-8 I _6 i -350 -750 i -520+ -590 0 -500 -1000 PPM E + A + D C+D -750 -350 A+B+ -55C A + d 500 -1000 PPM Fig. 8.

The scatter in the 8 Values for these species in the different samples probably can be explained by the difference in their solvation number in the adsorbed state: The participation of the water molecules in the coordination of the surface species is confirmed by the broadening of 51V NMR lines from the surface species after evacuation of the sample at 150 C. Thus we attribute line A to the adsorbed V04 species bound with A1203 surface via one or two oxygen atoms and having water molecules in their second coordination sphere. 71 Line B was detected at low V content in the samples calcined at 500 C. It is considerably broader compared with line A and has almost isotropic chemical shift tensor, with 8= -750 ppm. We attribute this line to isolated V04 tetrahedra bound with AIZO3 by two or more bonds. The line C with an axial anisotropy of chemical shift observed for the samples with large V content, can presumably be attributed to the polynuclear V species on A1203 surface having a distorted octahedral environment of oxygen atoms. The axial anisotropy of the chemical shift tensor is typical for octahedral V having one short bond V-O [10]. Line D is attributed to the AIV04 phase. From MAS spectra the isotropic chemical shift values were determined for each of three inequivalent V atoms in its structure 51= - 668 5 ppm, 52 = - 747 t 5 ppm, 51= - 780 5 ppm. The inequivalence of V atoms in the AIV04 structure is in agreement with X-ray data [ 15 ]. The line E with an axial anisotropy of the chemical shift tensor, 5, = - 310 ppm, 5 = -1250 ppm belongs to V205 crystals. The V atom in V205 has a distorted octahedral environment of oxygen atoms, one V-O bond being considerably shorter than five other bonds. The isotropic shift value measured from MAS spectra is 8;s. = - 610 ppm. The results presented in the previous section show that the type of supported surface species depends upon the pH of the impregnating solution, concentration of supported vanadium and the treatment temperature. At the lowest V concentration used in our experiments (about 1 wt.%) the surface species in the wet samples are the tetrahedral vanadium complexes bound probably via one bond with the A1203 surface (line A). They also have water molecules in their second coordination sphere. Thermal treatment or an increase in V concentration results in the elimination of water from the second coordination sphere, with formation of a bond with two or three surface oxygen atoms (line B). The latter conclusion is based on the isotropic chemical shift value 8= -750 ppm for line B, which is close to that for AIV04. It is known that the V atom in this compound contains four Al atoms in its second coordination sphere [ 15 ]. Probably the V species formed under these conditions can be regarded as a precursor for the formation of the AIV04 compound, which is usually observed at increased V concentration and at elevated temperatures. The increase in V concentration results in the formation of clusters in which a part of the V atoms have a distorted octahedral environment (line C). The formation of clusters is supported by increase in the width of the 51V NMR lines. The latter may be due to dipole-dipole interactions between s1V nuclei. The local environment of V atoms in the wet samples is mainly tetrahedral. Only a small part of the V acquires octahedral coordination after the third or fourth impregnation. An increase in treatment temperature increases the amount of Vin the octahedral environment. The magic angle spinning technique for the samples under study is effective only for the highly condensed compounds (Vz05, A1V04) and only 72 slightly decreases the width of the lines from the more dispersed surface species. This can be attributed to the large line width of surface species having a highly distorted local environment. For wet samples the dynamic exchange prqcesses in the second coordination sphere can also diminish the efficiency of magic angle spinning. Nevertheless, the use of MAS often allows one to separate closely spaced lines as illustrated in Fig. 7A for the sample containing 8.39'o V. Conclusion The results obtained in this work agree well with the data obtained in [ 11-131. But this work also contains additional information. First, use of the consecutive impregnation procedure has provided more detailed information on the interaction of the vanadium oxocomplexes in solution with the A1203 surface. In particular, the partial dissolution of A1203 may play an important role in this process at pH 12 and pH 0.4. The different 51V NMR spectra are classified and attributed to various surface vanadium species. At large V concentrations, AIV04 and V205 compounds are shown to be formed on the catalyst surface. For the latter samples, magic angle spinning is very effective in the narrowing of NMR lines. A comparison of the data obtained for different preparation methods shows that for the samples treated at high temperature (500 C) the types of surface species are very similar for all preparation methods. Thus, results presented in this work show the efficiency of 5'V NMR for studies of supported vanadium species. References 1 R. Kozlowski, R. F. Pettifer and J. M. Thomas, J.
