DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(10)60244-6 Isomerization of Æ -Pinene over Immobilized AlCl 3 Catalysts WU Yihui, TIAN Fuping*, HE Min, CAI Tianxi State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, Institute of Chemistry, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian 116024, Liaoning, China Abstract: Immobilized AlCl 3 catalysts supported on È–-Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 were prepared by a two-step vapor method and their catalytic ac- tivities were evaluated by the liquid phase isomerization of Ä®-pinene for the first time. The results showed that the immobilized AlCl 3 catalyst gave excellent catalytic performance for the isomerization of Ä®-pinene. The AlCl 3 /SiO 2 catalyst gave 98.4% conversion of Ä®-pinene and 93.7% selectivity for the main products such as camphene, limonene, and terpinolene at a reaction temperature of 40 Â°C. The AlCl 3 /È–-Al 2 O 3 catalyst gave much higher activity, 95.5% conversion of Ä®-pinene and 94.4% selectivity for the main products even at tem- peratures as low as 30 Â°C. The excellent catalytic performance of the immobilized AlCl 3 catalysts is due to their strong acidity. Key words: immobilization; aluminum chloride; Ä®-pinene; isomerization; silica; alumina; Ä®-Pinene is the main component of turpentine, which is the most abundantly produced natural essential oil in the world. Although turpentine has been used directly and extensively as a solvent, a diluent, and a skin irritant etc., more attention should be paid to the exploitation and utilization of its potential value [1]. Ä®-pinene, as one of the most important bicyclic monoter- penes, is a very reactive substrate because of its unique struc- ture. A large number of fine chemicals and raw materials have been obtained by these acid catalyzed reactions such as the isomerization, esterification, and polymerization of Ä®-pinene [2]. The products obtained by the acid catalyzed isomerization of Ä®-pinene are important intermediates for perfumes, phar- maceuticals, flavors, and fine chemicals. For example, cam- phene is obtained by ring expansion and is the main raw ma- terial for the synthesis of compounds such as camphor, santal, and toxaphene. Limonene is obtained by ring opening and it possesses an antitumor effect but it can also be used to syn- thesize many perfumes such as carvone, lavender alcohol, and menthol (Scheme 1). Therefore, it is of great economic interest to transform turpentine into high value products. Various types of catalysts such as metal oxides [3], heter- opolyacids [4], ion exchanged resins [5], clays [6], solid su- peracids [7], and micro- or mesoporous molecular sieves [8â€“10] have been investigated for the isomerization of Ä®-pinene. Considering that industrial Ä®-pinene isomerization is an energy consuming process and that the conversion of Ä®-pinene and the selectivity toward the target products with high values cannot usually be achieved simultaneously because of the complexity of this reaction, further study is necessary to find effective catalysts that will function under mild reaction conditions. Therefore, developing an environmentally friendly catalyst with high performance, low cost, and high selectivity toward the main products is the main objective of much re- search. Immobilized AlCl 3 catalysts, which give unique cata- lytic performance for aromatic alkylation and olefin polym- erization [11â€“14] are a type of environmentally friendly and high activity solid acid catalyst. This paper, for the first time, reports on the isomerization of Ä®-pinene upon catalysis by immobilized AlCl 3 catalysts, which showed high catalytic performance and selectivity toward the main products such as camphene, limonene, and terpinolene under mild conditions. The immobilized AlCl 3 catalysts were prepared by a two-step method. Silica gel and È–-Al 2 O 3 , which are produced by the Qingdao Haiyang Chemical Plant Co. and the Changling Petrochemical Refining Co., China, respectively, were used as supports. First, the È–-Al 2 O 3 support was dehydrated at 400 Â°C in a lower reactor under a N 2 stream for 2 h before use. The AlCl 3 that was produced in situ by the reaction between CCl 4 and pure È–-Al 2 O 3 in an upper reactor at 500 Â°C was carried into the lower reactor by a N 2 stream and it was immobilized on the pretreated support at 300 Â°C for 3 h. After that, excess and physically adsorbed AlCl 3 was removed by flowing N 2 at 400 WU Yihui et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1138â€“1142 Â°C. Finally, the immobilized catalysts were cooled to room temperature under N 2 protection and the resultant catalyst was denoted AlCl 3 /È–-Al 2 O 3 . A catalyst supported on SiO 2 was also prepared as per the above description except that the pre- treatment and the purging process were carried out at 300 Â°C. The resultant catalyst was denoted AlCl 3 /SiO 2 . The chloride content of the catalyst was determined by potentiometric titra- tion. The isomerization reaction was carried out at atmospheric pressure in a glass reactor with a reflux condenser under con- tinuous magnetic stirring. For a typical run, 0.10 g of the catalyst and 2 ml of Ä®-pinene (Aldrich, 98%) were charged into the reactor. The reaction time and temperature were investi- gated systematically. The samples were analyzed using a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a HP 6890N-5975B (GC-MS). The conversion of Ä®-pinene and selectivity toward the products were obtained by the area normalization method. The chemical analysis results indicate that the mass fractions of [â€“Oâ€“AlCl 2 ] on SiO 2 and È–-Al 2 O 3 were 10.6% and 8.5%, respectively. Previous studies have shown that the immobili- zation of AlCl 3 onto the surface of supports can be achieved by the reaction between AlCl 3 and the surface hydroxyl groups on the support and this is accompanied by HCl release [15,16]. Over 90% of the chloroaluminum species on the surface of the immobilized catalyst have a composition of [â€“Oâ€“AlCl 2 ]. Therefore, the different [â€“Oâ€“AlCl 2 ] loadings on the SiO 2 and È–-Al 2 O 3 supports can be attributed to different amounts of surface hydroxyl groups. Table 1 shows the catalytic performance of the AlCl 3 /SiO 2 catalyst for Ä®-pinene isomerization at different temperatures. AlCl 3 /SiO 2 gave high catalytic activity and the conversion of Ä®-pinene increased significantly with an increase in the tem- perature. Almost 100% conversion of Ä®-pinene was achieved at 60 Â°C for 30 min but the selectivity toward camphene and limonene decreased while the amount of high retention prod- ucts increased. The reduction of limonene indicated that limonene transformed into Ä®- and È–-terpinene by consecutive reactions at relatively high temperatures (Scheme 1).

WU Yihui et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1138â€“1142 resulted in an evident improvement in the conversion of Ä®-pinene whereas selectivity toward camphene and limonene remained nearly constant. For example, 98.4% Ä®-pinene con- version and 93.7% selectivity toward the main products were obtained when the reaction was carried out at 40 Â°C for 120 min. Table 2 shows the catalytic performance of the AlCl 3 / È–-Al 2 O 3 catalyst during Ä®-pinene isomerization. AlCl 3 /È–-Al 2 O 3 gave much higher activity than AlCl 3 /SiO 2 . 80.6% Ä®-pinene conversion and 96.5% selectivity toward the main products were achieved when the reaction was carried out at 30 Â°C for 30 min. When the reaction temperature was raised to 45 Â°C, 100% Ä®-pinene conversion was obtained and the selectivity toward the main products decreased slightly. Similarly, 95.5% Ä®-pinene conversion and 94.4% selectivity toward the main products were achieved upon prolonging the reaction time at a relatively low temperature (Table 2, entry 4). Studies on the surface acidity of the immobilized AlCl 3 catalyst indicated that large amounts of strong Lewis and BrÃ¶nsted acid sites exist [17,18]. Ã–zkan et al. [19] found that camphene and other bicyclic products were preferentially formed on Lewis acid sites while monocyclic products were preferentially formed on BrÃ¶nsted acid sites and the distribu- tion of products was related to the change in the Lewis/BrÃ¶nsted ratio. Therefore, the high catalytic perform- ance of the immobilized AlCl 3 catalyst in this work is due to the strong acidity. In summary, an immobilized AlCl 3 catalyst is shown to be a novel environmentally friendly solid acid catalyst, which can catalyze the isomerization of Ä®-pinene effectively. Further work will focus on the modification of the support to improve selectivity toward a single product by adjusting the Lewis/ BrÃ¶nsted ratio and this will provide an experimental basis for the transformation of turpentine into high-value products.

        "dc:description": "Immobilized AlCl3 catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 and SiO2 were prepared by a two-step vapor method and their catalytic activities were evaluated by the liquid phase isomerization of α-pinene for the first time. The results showed that the immobilized AlCl3 catalyst gave excellent catalytic performance for the isomerization of α-pinene. The AlCl3/SiO2 catalyst gave 98.4% conversion of α-pinene and 93.7% selectivity for the main products such as camphene, limonene, and terpinolene at a reaction temperature of 40 °C. The AlCl3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst gave much higher activity, 95.5% conversion of α-pinene and 94.4% selectivity for the main products even at temperatures as low as 30 °C. The excellent catalytic performance of the immobilized AlCl3 catalysts is due to their strong acidity.",
