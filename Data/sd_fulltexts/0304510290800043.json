ANDERSON*, STEVEN L. SUIB Department of Chemistry, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06268 (U.SA.) and MARK) L. OCCELU Unocal Corporation, Brea, CA 92621 (U.SA.) (Received December 11,1989; revised March 21,1990) Summary Tin Mossbauer spectroscopy has been used to probe the role of tin in the passivation of vanadium contaminants in model systems comprising EuY, aluminosilicate gels and EuY-gel mixtures. When tin is loaded on the catalysts in the form of tetraphenyl tin, Sn(Ph)4, it remains mostly intact on the zeolite, but on the gel forms oxygen ligands that replace one or two phenyl groups. On the zeolite, part of the tin remains on the surface while part migrates to internal sites. In zeolite-gel mixtures, tin is preferentially sorbed by the zeolite. At all stages of catalyst pretreatment, metallic tin, Sn(II) and tin- vanadium alloys are not formed. Calcination and steaming produced vanadium/tin oxide complexes (formed through oxygen bridges) in which tin is in the +4 oxidation state. Formation of Sn4\"*\" 0 V5\"1' linkages is probably responsible for the passivation of V by tetraphenyl tin deposition. Introduction The deactivation of fluid cracking catalysts by feed metals such as vanadium (and to a lesser extent, copper) is becoming an increasingly important problem to refiners, since metals levels on equilibrium cracking catalysts have been steadily increasing during the past twenty years, irregardless of crude prices [1]. At conditions normally employed in micro- activity testing, it has been shown that intraparticle transport of vanadium (probably as fl^Oy) occurs and that the addition of metal scavenging particles to a cracking catalyst can generate mixtures with high tolerance to V-deactivation [2]. Metals that reach the catalyst surface can be passivated by adding compounds such as antimony organics capable of reacting with Ni and forming inert residues. Vanadium passivation has not been as success- fill, although tin has been reported capable of reducing the deleterious effects of V-contaminants [3-7]. In fact, tin concentrations between 0.2 wt% and ^Current address: Department of Chemistry, U.M.I.S.T., P.O. Box 88, Manchester M60 1QD, U.K. 0304-5102/90/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 296 2.50 wt% are thought effective in preventing the breakdown of the zeolite structure. However, addition of too much tin may have a negative effect [4]. In this paper, \"\"Sn Mossbauer spectroscopy will be used to probe the oxidation state as well as the chemical environment of Sn on model materials (used in catalyst preparation) artificially contaminated with vanadium. This work complements two other studies on the same systems in which (1) luminescence experiments [8] have been performed to probe the environment of rare-earth cations in a zeolite with the faujasite structure and (2) in which electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies have been used to monitor the decrease in cracking activity induced by the presence of vanadium [9]. The objective of this work is to provide information on those metal-surface interactions which can be useful in the preparation of metal-tolerant catalysts. Experimental A sample of Nr^Y zeolite (supplied by Alfa Ventron) was exchanged with Eu3'1\" cations by stirring overnight 4 g of zeolite in 400 ml of 0.05 M Eu(N03)g-6H20 at room temperature. The crystals were then washed sparingly with distilled deionized water and dried in air. The incipient wetness method was used to load the catalysts with 1.0 wt% vanadium and 1.0-2.0 wt% tin. Vanadium naphthenate in toluene was slurried with the catalyst and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. Tin was loaded with a similar procedure using tetraphenyl tin. After metal loading, the catalysts were first calcined in flowing air at 575 C for 10 h to remove the organic ligands and then steam deactivated by heating to 730 C in a flowing 95%/5% HgO/Nz mixture with a flow rate of 4 ml water per hour. Three catalyst components were studied: (a) EuY, prepared as men- tioned above, (b) AAA alumina, which is a 75% Si02/25% AlgOs aluminosili- cate gel provided by Davison, Columbia, MD, and (c) a 50/50 mixture of EuY and AAA-alumina. The nomenclature used to describe the various catalysts and treatments has been outlined in detail elsewhere [8]. For example, EuY-AAA (SNCVCS) would refer to the mixed EuY/AAA catalyst system that has been loaded with 1 wt% tin (SN), calcined (C), loaded with 1 wt% vanadium (V), calcined (C), and finally steamed (S). In some systems, the EuY and AAA-alumina were mixed after metal loading onto one component in order to monitor possible metal migration. An example of such a catalyst is: EuY (SNAAAC). In this case, EuY has been loaded with tin (SN), then mixed with the gel (AAA) and finally calcined (C). Tin concentrations up to 2 wt% have been used. The y-ray source for Mossbauer spectroscopy was a 15mCi CaSnOa source supplied by Amersham Company. This source was mounted on an EIscint model MVT-4 velocity transducer connected to an Elscint model MDF-N-5 constant velocity driver. The detection system consisted of a Harshaw/Filtrol Nal (Tl) scintillation crystal detector operating at 800V 297 which was linked to a Canberra model 2005 scintillation detector preampli- fier. Data were collected on a Canberra series 35 multichannel analyzer and transferred to an IBM mainframe for Lorentzian line-fitting. Powder samples were mounted in cylindrical Teflon cups 1cm diameter and 1/2 cm deep which were cooled to 77 K in liquid nitrogen in a Janis Dewar. Typically, spectra were scanned over the -5 to +5 mm s~1 velocity region using SnOg and ff Sn as calibration standards. The curve resolution of each spectrum reported here is a unique fit based on a series of possible fits to the data. The curve fitting routine used was performed with a modified version of a previously reported program [21]. All data were fit to Lorentzian lines since attempts to fit the data to Gaussian lines failed. The criteria for best fits to the experimental data were the minimization of the probability and the closeness of the x2 value to 1.0. Results EuY A list of the isomer shifts, quadrupole splittings and linewidths for all fitted Mossbauer spectra of the materials studied are given in Table 1. The Mossbauer spectrum for the (1%) tin-loaded EuY consists of two narrow signals with a full width at half height, I\\, of about 0.8 nun s~1 at isomer shifts 6 of -0.11 and 1.36 mm s~1, Fig. la. After calcination at 575 C, a quadruple split doublet with 6 =0.04 mm s~1, r,= 1.24 nuns\"1 and quad- rupolar splitting A =0.80 nuns\"1 is seen. Fig. Ib. Steaming leaves the Mossbauer parameters unchanged, see Fig. Ic and Table 1.

A similar quadrupolar split doublet is also observed after vanadium addition to the tin-loaded EuY and calcination. Fig. 2a; however, the quadrupolar splitting decreases to 0.70 mm s~1. Steaming EuY loaded with both tin and vanadium increased the isomer shift to 0.15 mm s~1, while the quadrupole splitting and linewidth decreased to A = 0.52 mm s~1 and I\\. = 0.86 mm s~1, respectively. Nevertheless, the spectrum is still well simulated with a quadrupolar split doublet. Then the order of metal addition was reversed and vanadium deposited first. In this case, tin loaded on vanadium- containing EuY resulted in exactly the same spectrum as when tin was loaded onto the metal-free zeolite, see Table 1. The small difference in the quadrupole splitting between the calcined EuY (VCSNC) and EuY (SNCVC) samples, (A = 0.58 and 0.80 mm s~1, respectively) disappeared after steam- ing. Irrespective of the order of metal addition, spectra similar to those shown in Fig. 2b were obtained. Mixtures prepared using Sn-loaded AAA-alumina (SNAAAC) and EuY exhibited a spectrum similar to Sn-loaded EuY (SNC); EuY (SNAAACS) mixtures showed slightly larger linewidth than EuY (SNCS). When the Sn-loaded gel was mixed with the zeolite after calcination, [EuY (SNCAAAS)], an increase in the isomer shift to 0.12 nuns\"1 was observed compared to EuY (SNCS) where A = 0.07 mm s~1. This result suggests that the gel has a negligible effect on the mixture spectrum until steam aging is completed. 299 Figure 3 shows a series of Mossbauer spectra for EuY loaded with 1.5 wt% Sn. An advantage of using a higher Sn concentration is that the signal to noise ratio of the spectra is substantially better, thus allowing for resolution of more spectral features. At this tin concentration (after loading with tetraphenyl tin) a singlet at 6 = 1.29 mm s~1 is seen, Fig. 3a. The very broad signal centered around zero isomer shift observed after calcination can be simulated by the use of two quadrupole split doublets with 6 = 0.15 nuns\"1, A =2.1 mm s~1 and 6 =0.13 nuns\"1, A =0.79 nuns\"1, see Fig. 3b. After vanadium addition, two doublets with a different intensity ratio are obtained. The Mossbauer parameters are now 6 = 0.0 mm s~1, = 1.7 nuns\"1 and 6 -0.06 mm s~1, A =0.56 nuns\"1, see Fig. 3c. Calcination has little effect on the Mossbauer spectrum but after steaming the spectrum becomes narrower and may now be simulated by one doublet with 6 = 0.05 mm s~1, and A = 0.59 mm s~1, see Fig. 3d. AAA-Alumina Figure 4a shows the tin Mossbauer spectrum of AAA-alumina loaded with tin. As with EuY, two signals are observed, one at -0.31 mm s~1 and one at 1.28 nuns\"1. However, the intensity ratio of the two peaks is completely different than that for EuY. The intensity ratio is denned as the signal near 0 mm s~1 divided by the signal near 1.3 mm s~1, which is 1.0 for AAA-alumina and 0.12 for EuY. After calcination at 575 C, the AAA-alumina spectrum has similar Mossbauer parameters 6 = 0.04 and A = 0.88 mm s~1, Fig. 4b. Steam aging AAA-alumina (SNC) produced a spectrum. Fig. 4c, similar to that of EuY (SNCS), Fig. Ib. Calcination and steaming have little effect on the V-loaded AAA-alumina (SNC) Mossbauer parameters; in each case, within experimental error, 6 = 0.22, A = 0.8 and Fy = 1.1 mm s~1. In contrast, the EuY Mossbauer parameters changed considerably upon steaming. -1-4-2024 -6-4-2024 VELOCITY (mm/*) VELOCITY (mm/B) Fig. 3.

(A) AAA(VCSN), (B) AAA(VCSNC), (C) AAA(VCSNCS). Addition of tin to vanadium-loaded gel results in the spectrum shown in Fig. 5a. There are three signals at 6 = -0.33, 1.40 and at 2.51 mm s~1 with intensity ratios of 1:0.45:0.61, respectively. After calcination of the metal- loaded gel (VCSN), a quadrupole split doublet with 6 = 0.55, A = 0.79 and Fr= 1.18 mm s~1 is observed. Fig. 5b; the order of metal addition had little effect on this spectrum. However, after steaming (to produce AAA(VCSNCS)) there is an increase in the isomer shift to 0.12 mm s~1 and a small decrease in the quadrupole splitting to 0.65 mm s~1 compared to that for AAA (SNCVCS). This indicates some effect of the order of metal deposition on the steam-aged gels. When AAA alumina is loaded with Sn and then mixed with EuY, before either calcination or steaming, there is an effect due to the presence of EuY on the Mossbauer parameters observed, see Table 1. AAA-EuYMixtures Figure 6a shows the spectrum for these mixtures loaded with tin. Two signals at 6 = -0.08 and 1.40 mm s~1 with an intensity ratio of 0.34 are observed. Calcination at 575 C produced a sample exhibiting a spectrum very similar to those for the individual components, Fig. 6b. After steaming, the overall linewidth broadens and it is necessary to invoke two sets of quadrupole split doublets. The Mossbauer parameters for these two species 301 V 1.2. y A VELOCITY (mm/8) Fig. 6. Tin Mossbauer spectra recorded at 77 K, isomer shifts relative to SnOz.

Discussion ^Sn Mossbauer spectroscopy can be used to distinguish both the local environment of the tin species and tin oxidation states. Tin metal gives a single resonance, at 2.56 for ft-Sn and 2.00 nuns\"1 for a-Sn. The isomer shifts reported here are all relative to SnOg for which 6 = 0.0 mm s~1. Tin(II) oxidation state compounds can be easily identified by Mossbauer spectros- copy due to their large positive isomer shifts ranging from 2.3-4.1 mm s~1. Tin(IV) compounds, on the other hand, fall in the -0.8-1.9 mm s~1 isomer shift range. Quadrupole splittings are also present in asymmetric complexes and can be as large as 5.5 nuns\"1 for tin compounds. Often, however, the quadrupole splittings are small and, because the natural linewidth of 0.626 mm s~1 for the 23.875 keV decay used in tin Mossbauer experiments is fairly large, this splitting may remain unresolved. Alloys of tin fall in the 1.3-3.0 mm s~1 isomer shift range. Tin-Loaded Zeolites Tetraphenyl tin (used for loading tin on the catalysts) has a character* istic Mossbauer spectrum which is a singlet at 1.22 0.9 nuns\"1 isomer shifts [10]. After loading lwt% tin on EuY, two signals were observed, a strong one at 1.36 and another weak signal at 0.11 mm s~1. The signal at 302 1.36 mm s~1, which is close to the natural linewidth with r, = 0.8 mm s~1, is indicative of the tetraphenyl tin remaining, to a greater extent intact after deposition. The signal at 0.11 mm s~1 (if a singlet) would be indicative of a symmetrical tin species (SnOz) with all oxygen ligands. Such a transforma- tion at room temperature seems unlikely. A more likely explanation is that the signal at -0.11 nuns\"1 is part of a quadrupole split doublet, with the second signal concealed under the tetraphenyl tin signal. The Mossbauer parameters for such a species are 6 = 0.6 mm s~1 and A = 1.5 mm s~1, Fig. la. Species that have been reported with similar Mossbauer parameters are (Ph)zSnO, 6 =0.88 nuns\"1, A =1.23 mm s-1 [II], and (Ph)3Sn(oxime) with 6 =1.07 mm s\"1 and A =1.75 nuns\"1 [12]. It is possible, therefore, that about 10% of the tin has lost one or two phenyl ligands which have been replaced by zeolite lattice oxygen. At higher tin loadings (1.5 and 2.0 wt% Sn) this additional species (exhibiting a quadrupole split doublet) was not observed. After calcination of EuY loaded with 1 wt% Sn, a quadrupole split doublet with 6 = 0.04 mm s~1 and A = 0.80 mm s~1 was observed. This is an indication that all phenyl groups have been removed, since tin species with phenyl groups usually have isomer shifts greater than 1.0 mm s~1. Further- more, tin is definitely in the +4 oxidation state; the small quadrupole splitting and the lower isomer shift suggest that a fall complement of oxygen ligands is likely. Formation of rare earth alloys, such as EuSna [13] or EuSn [14] can be excluded on the basis of Mossbauer parameters. On the other hand, rare earth stannates, such as Eu2Sna07, give Mossbauer spectra very similar [15] to that observed when Sn(IV) is in an octahedral environment. Luminescence studies of Eu3\"1\" in these same systems [8] have indicated that the Eu3\"1' environment does not change upon tin addition, probably because the Eu3\"1\" is recessed in the sodalite cages of the zeolite structure. This would suggest that the tin oxide species formed is not a rare earth stannate. Many other oxide species with tin in an octahedral environment exhibit very similar isomer shifts [16]. At higher Sn concentration, a somewhat different Mossbauer spec- trum is observed, Fig. 3b. In addition to a quadrupole split doublet with a small quadrupole splitting (A = 0.79 mm s~1), there is another species with a much larger quadrupole splitting, (A =2.1 mm s\"1). Upon addition of vanadyl naphthenate, this latter species is considerably diminished in intensity, whereas the species with small quadrupole splitting remains more or less the same, Fig. 3c. Vanadyl naphthenate is too large to diffuse into the zeolite Y channels, thus the large quadrupole splitting can be attributed to a surface species and the small quadrupole splitting to an internal species. At 1 wt% Sn loading, therefore, most of the Sn after calcination is located inside the zeolite, whereas at 1.5 wt% Sn, about 50% is a surface species. At 2.0 wt% Sn after calcination, the Mossbauer spectrum (not shown) indicated that about 30% of the Sn could be attributed to surface species. It is possible that slight variations in sample preparation can result in different con- centrations of surface and internal species. 303 Steaming Sn-loaded EuY crystals produced almost no change in the Mossbauer spectrum, suggesting that this treatment did not affect the tin environment. Addition of vanadium [to EuY(SN)] did not produce changes in the Mossbauer spectrum, again indicating that this Sn species is internal. However, calcination and steaming reduced the quadrupole splitting from 0.8 to 0.7 and 0.52 mm s~1, respectively. Also, upon steaming, the isomer shift changed from 0.01 to 0.10 mm s~1. These changes are indicative of some effect of the vanadium on the tin environment. Vanadium/tin alloys have an isomer shift near 1.56 mm s~1 [17,18] and therefore are not present. A vanadium/tin oxide complex could have been formed; many tin oxide species will give similar Mossbauer parameters. In a study of Sn(IV) ions in a VgOg matrix [19], it was shown that tin could either isomorphically replace vanadium or reside at interstitial points in the matrix. The stereochemistry of these sites is trigonal prismatic or distorted tetrahedral. One site (interpreted to be the interstitial tetrahedral site) resulted in a Mossbauer spectrum with 6=0 mm s~1 and A = 0.5 mm s~1, very similar to the parameters recorded for EuY (SNCVCS). It is known from complementary electron paramagnetic resonance data on these samples [9] that vanadium is indeed in the +5 oxidation state. Therefore, this type ofV205/Sn(IV) species is a possible candidate for the tin/vanadium complex being formed on the zeolite. The gradual decrease in quadrupole splitting upon calcination followed by steaming suggests that the effect of vanadium on the tin environment increases with each successive treatment. When vanadium is loaded first, the quadrupole splitting for EuY (VCSNC) is less than EuY (SNCVC). After steaming, there is no difference in the extent of complexation with order of loading. Tin-loaded AAA-alumina The Mossbauer spectrum of the Sn-loaded gel consists of two signals of almost equal intensity at 0.31 mm s~1 and 1.28 mm s~1, Fig. 3a. As with EuY, if these signals are part of a quadrupole split doublet with 6 = 0.5 mm s~1 and A = 1.6 mm s~1, then most of the tin has at least one phenyl group replaced by oxygen ligands. Fig. 4a. The effect is much more pronounced for the gel than for the zeolite. Calcined tin-loaded AAA-alumina produced almost the same Mossbauer signal as EuY (SNC), suggesting that the same tin oxide species is generated on both the zeolite component and the gel, and that the Eu\"1\"3 cations did not effect formation of this species. Similarly, steaming produced the same tin oxide species on both materials. When vanadium is loaded on the gel first and calcined, followed by addition of tin, the spectrum shown in Fig. 5a results. In this case, three signals are observed at 6 = -0.33, 1.40 and 2.51 mm s~1; the signal at -0.33 mm s~1 has intensity equal to the sum of the other two signals. This suggests that the two signals with positive isomer shifts are each part of different quadrupole split doublets, the other half of the signals being unresolved at about 0.33 mm s~1. In other words the spectra indicate that 304 two species with Mossbauer parameters 6 = 0.5 mm s~1, A = 1.7 mm s~1 and 6 = 1.1 mm s~1, A = 2.81 mm s~1 are present. The former of these signals is characteristic of tin species such as (Pl^gSnO or (Ph)aSn 0 Si. The latter of these signals is characteristic of (Ph)3SnOH where one hydroxyl group has substituted for a phenyl group. The Mossbauer parameters for such a species are 6 = 1.18 and = 2.68 nuns\"1 [20]. One significant difference between the samples AAA (VCSN) and AAA (SN) is that the former has been calcined before tin addition. This heat treatment probably changed the gel surface properties, causing the formation of the different species observed. Despite the initial difference in the state of the tin (i.e. cf. Figs. 5a and 4a) after calcination, the order of vanadium and tin deposition seems to be irrelevant. Furthermore, since spectral changes after steam aging are not pronounced on the gel as on the zeolite, it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions about the nature of vanadium/tin interactions. It seems that at all times, tin is in the +4 oxidation state and that Sn/V complexes are formed through oxygen bridges. For similar reasons, it is difficult to establish the possibility of vanadium or tin migration in mixtures of tin-loaded AAA-alumina and EuY crystals. Tin-loaded EuY AAA-alumina mixtures When tin is loaded directly on a EuY-gel mixture, the Mossbauer spectrum shown in Fig. 6a is obtained. As with the individual component systems, two signals are observed at 0.08 and 1.40 mm s~1. The ratio of the intensity of these signals is 0.34, which is different than that obtained for either tin-loaded EuY or AAA-alumina. Assuming the spectrum for the mixed system to be a combination of the two spectra for the one-component systems, it is calculated that approximately three times as much tin is deposited on the zeolite as on the AAA alumina. Calcination of 1 wt% tin on the mixed system resulted in the usual Mossbauer spectrum found for tin calcined on the corresponding one- component systems. However, after steaming a more complex broad line spectrum (that could not be easily simulated by one quadrupole split doublet) was obtained. This is probably due to a tin species on each material, resulting in a slightly different Mossbauer spectrum. Reversing the order of metal deposition provided little further chemical information except that the profiles of the Mossbauer spectra (after calcination and steaming) are independent of this order. A schematic representation of the order of events is shown on p. 305. Similar schemes can be drawn for the gel alone and for gel-EuY mixtures. Conclusions In a typical fluidized cracking catalyst unit (FCCU), metal con- taminants in the feed are continuously deposited on the catalyst surface.

This continuous deposition of metal contaminants and metal pas- sivators in a refinery FCCU has been approximated in the laboratory by Mitchell [22]. His procedure involves a one-step impregnation with or- ganometallic compounds dissolved in benzene, followed by calcination and steam-aging. This artificial method of metal deposition has been proven capable of reducing the activity and selectivity properties of freshly synthe- sized material (such as those used in this study) to that of equilibrium FCC containing similar metal levels [22]. As a result, this simplified procedure has been widely used to study metal effects on newly prepared FCC and FCC components [1-9]. Mossbauer spectroscopy experiments with zeolites and gels metal- contaminated using the Mitchell procedure [22] have indicated that tin complexes (formed on materials used in the preparation of cracking catalysts) involve tin in the +4 oxidation state with ligands formed through oxygen bridges; probably these complexes are of the Sn^ 0 V5\"1' type. Formation of metallic tin, Sn(II) or vanadium/tin alloys was not observed. Tin is deposited on the zeolite primarily in the form of Sn(Ph)4, whereas on the amorphous gel it is deposited as Sn(Ph)30 Si or as Sn(Ph)30H. Calcination at 575 C in flowing air is sufficient to remove all organic ligands. On the zeolite substrate, part of the Sn remains on the surface while part migrates to internal sites. Most of the vanadium/tin interactions take place during steaming at 730 C, and the species formed do not depend on the order of metal deposition. On a AAA-alumina/EuY mixture, tin is preferentially deposited on the zeolite. Formation of Sn^ 0 V\"1\"6 type complexes could inhibit V zeolite interactions, thus helping to preserve zeolite crystallinity and cracking activity when fluidized cracking catalysts (FCC) are con- taminated with V compounds. 306 Acknowledgements We thank the donors of the Petroleum Research Fund of the American Chemical Society for support of this research.

Mario L. Occelli Unocal Corporation, Brea, CA 92621 U.S.A. Tin Mössbauer spectroscopy has been used to probe the role of tin in the passivation of vanadium contaminants in model systems comprising EuY, aluminosilicate gels and EuY-gel mixtures. When tin is loaded on the catalysts in the form of tetraphenyl tin, Sn(Ph)4, it remains mostly intact on the zeolite, but on the gel forms oxygen ligands that replace one or two phenyl groups. On the zeolite, part of the tin remains on the surface while part migrates to internal sites. In zeolite-gel mixtures, tin is preferentially sorbed by the zeolite. At all stages of catalyst pretreatment, metallic tin, Sn(II) and tin-vanadium alloys are not formed. Calcination and steaming produced vanadium/tin oxide complexes (formed through oxygen bridges) in which tin is in the +4 oxidation state. Formation of Sn4+—O—V5+ linkages is probably responsible for the passivation of V by tetraphenyl tin deposition. References 1 M.L. Occelli Fluid, Catalytic Cracking: Role in Modern Refining M.L.
