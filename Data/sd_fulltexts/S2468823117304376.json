Graphical abstract A porous dual-functional acid-base covalent organic polymer catalyst (CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H)) was prepared using a facile Friedel-Crafts reaction of triphenylbenzene and terephthaloyl chloride to prepare the polymer backbone (CBAP-1) followed by functionalization with ethylenediamine (EDA) and a simple chlorosulfonic acid treatment. The resultant polymeric catalyst and its functional moieties were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), elemental analysis (EA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), and N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm analyses. The catalytic activity of CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H) was then assessed for one-pot cascade CC bond-forming reactions involving deacetylation-Knoevenagel condensation and Henry reactions. Compared with the homogeneous catalyst and CBAP-1 functionalized with just acid or base, CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H) showed superior catalytic activity and selectivity, and was found to be reusable for up to seven consecutive runs. A catalytic mechanism for CC bond-forming reactions over CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H) was proposed. Keywords Cascade reaction Acid-base reaction Covalent organic polymers Knoevenagel reaction Henry reaction 1 Introduction Efficient and sustainable catalytic processes that minimize the production of environmentally polluting byproducts by achieving high selectivity in short reaction times are highly desirable for the chemical industry. In this regard, synergistic catalysis in one-pot cascade reactions from simple substrate molecules is important because it is a more efficient, atom economical, time saving, and environmentally friendly strategy for the synthesis of complex organic compounds than traditional stepwise reactions [1–3]. The synergistic reaction strategy utilizes catalysts with two or more active sites in close proximity to activate the reactants, reducing the activation energy barrier, number of reaction steps, necessity for purification of the intermediates, need for multi-solvents, and energy consumption [4,5]. These reactions are catalyzed by the intial active sites on the catalyst to produce the intermediates, which are then further activated by adjacent catalytic sites to form the final products [6]. This type of synergistic catalysis has become increasingly employed in nanocatalysis [7,8], enzyme catalysis [9], electrocatalysis [10], and photocatalysis [11], all of which present opportunities for cascade organic reactions [12–14]. Many homogeneous catalysts are applied to cascade reactions requiring dual acid-base functionality [15–18]. However, homogeneous catalytic systems have well-known problems in regarding product separation and reusability, increasing costs and environmental impact [15,17,18]. In addition, bifunctional acid-base catalytic activity is easily deactivated in homogeneous reaction media owing to acid-base neutralization. Therefore, solid heterogeneous bifunctional acid-base catalysts in which the acidic and basic functional groups are fixed in different locations in the solid matrix have received increasing attention for one-pot cascade reactions [19–22]. To date, cooperative bifunctional acid-base bifunctional catalytic sites on silica [23,24], heteropoly acids [25], metal organic frameworks [26–28], metal oxides [29], graphene oxide [30], and covalent organic polymers [19] have been employed for cascade reactions. For example, Shylexh et al. reported the use of bifunctional acid-base periodic mesoporous organosilica for deacetylation-Knoevenagel reactions [23]. Among other examples, Shiju et al. developed phosphotungstic acid immobilized mesoporous silica for deacetylation-Henry reactions [25], amine-functionalized MIL-101(Al)-NH2 has been used for deacetylation-Knoevenagel reactions [28], Li et al. prepared Mg-Al oxide-incorporated Al-containing mesoporous silica for one-pot cascade deacetylation-Knoevenagel reactions [29], and Zhang et al. synthesized an amine-functionalized graphene oxide catalyst for deacetylation-Knoevenagel reactions [30]. Recently, Shinde et al. have synthesized a porphyrin-based covalent organic framework using dihydroxyterephthalic acid and 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)porphyrin molecules for the deacetylation-Knoevenagel reaction, in which the amino-porphyrin connection was formed by a two-step reaction [19]. However, in these studies, it was often necessary to employ a protection-deprotection procedure to avoid acid-base neutralization. In addition, multi-step syntheses were necessary to synthesize the solid support materials. Therefore, the development of low-cost, simple syntheses of heterogeneous solid catalysts incorporating stable acid-base functional moieties for acid-base one-pot cascade reactions is highly desirable. Recently, porous covalent organic polymers have drawn increasing interest as heterogeneous catalysts owing to their tunable chemical functionalities, high surface areas, and high chemical stabilities in different reaction media. High surface area and tunable chemical functionality is advantageous for enhanced adsorption and activation of reactants [31–33]. In addition, the high chemical stability of the support material should help avoid the contamination of the products [34,35]. Recently, highly porous covalent organic polymers containing carbonyl units that were modified with different amine compounds were prepared via a facile Friedel-Crafts reaction using readily available commercial chemicals [36,37]. Herein, we applied this strategy to the preparation of an efficient dual-functional acid-base covalent organic polymer catalyst. The developed catalyst was successfully applied to two-step one-pot cascade CC bond-forming reactions that involved acid-catalyzed deacetylation followed by base-catalyzed Knoevenagel and Henry reactions. Recycling studies were also conducted to demonstrate the high stability of the catalyst. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials Anhydrous aluminum chloride, terephthaloyl chloride, 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene, dichloromethane (DCM), ethylenediamine (EDA), sodium borohydride, chlorosulfonic acid, benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal, nitromethane, malononitrile, methanol, and toluene were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and were used as received without further purification. 2.2 Catalyst preparation The preparation of the parent porous covalent organic polymer CBAP-1 and post-functionalization with EDA (CBAP-1(EDA)) were conducted according to our previously reported procedure [36]. Briefly, 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene (10mmol, 3.06g), terephthaloyl chloride (15mmol, 3.05g), anhydrous AlCl3 (15mmol, 2.00g), and DCM (180mL) were mixed in a 250-mL round-bottom flask fitted with a condenser. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 12h to produce a dark brown solid powder and the precipitated material was filtered and successively washed with DCM, methanol, and water. The product was further purified in a Soxhlet extractor for 10h using water to completely remove the catalyst and dried under vacuum at 130°C for 12h to achieve solvent free CBAP-1 in 92% yield. The C and H contents of CBAP-1 (84.93%C and 4.06% H) from EA (EA, EA1112, Italy) were in good agreement with the theoretical composition (86.21%C and 4.22% H). The fresh CBAP-1 (1.00g) was added to an EDA solution (2mL in 40mL methanol) and refluxed for 15h. After cooling to room temperature, NaBH4 (ca. 2.00g) was added slowly and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 10h. Then, the solid mixture was filtered and washed successively with methanol and water, and dried at 130°C to yield 1.18g of CBAP-1(EDA). Then, 1.00g of CBAP-1(EDA) was placed in 40mL of dry DCM and cooled to 5°C in an ice-bath with stirring for 10min. Chlorosulfonic acid (0.10mL) dissolved in 5mL of DCM was then added dropwise into the CBAP-1(EDA) suspension over 5min, and the resulting mixture was stirred for 2h at room temperature. Then, the mixture was poured into ice-cooled water (200mL) and the solid phase was filtered, washed with distilled water (100mL×3), and dried at 110°C to yield 1.04g of CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H). For comparison, CBAP-1(SO3H) was prepared by the following similar procedure: CBAP-1 (1.00g) in 40mL of dry DCM was cooled to 5°C in an ice-bath with stirring for 10min. Then, 25mL of chlorosulfonic acid dissolved in 40mL of DCM was added dropwise to the CBAP-1 suspension over 1h, and the resulting mixture was stirred for 3days at room temperature. The mixture was then poured into ice-cooled water (500mL) and the solid catalyst was filtered, washed with distilled water (500mL×3), and dried at 110°C to yield 1.03g of CBAP-1(SO3H) 2.3 Catalysts characterization Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the developed solid catalysts were recorded on a VERTEX 80V FT-IR spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) using the standard KBr pellet method. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Rigaku diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation over 2θ=10–60° at a scan rate of 2°/min. The surface electronic states were examined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source and a hemispherical analyzer (Thermo Scientific, USA). The textural properties of the solid catalysts were determined from nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, which were recorded at 77K on a BELsorp-max analyzer (BEL, Japan) after activation of the sold catalyst at 120°C overnight. The specific surface areas were calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation in the relative pressure range 0.05–0.10. 2.4 Catalytic reactions 2.4.1 One-pot deacetylation-Knoevenagel reaction In a typical reaction, benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal (4mmol), malononitrile (4.2mmol), CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H) (80mg), toluene (4mL), and H2O (1mL) were mixed in a reaction tube fitted with a condenser. The reaction mixture was kept at 70°C under magnetic stirring for 80min and aliquots of the sample mixture were extracted using a filter syringe and analyzed on a gas chromatographer equipped with an HP-5 capillary column (Agilent Technologies 7890A, flame ionization detector) to determine the yield of benzalmalononitrile. 2.4.2 One-pot deacetylation-Henry reaction In a typical reaction, benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal (4mmol), CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H) (120mg), nitromethane (4mL), and H2O (1mL) were mixed in a reaction tube fitted with a condenser. The reaction mixture was kept at 80°C under magnetic stirring for 7h and aliquots of the reaction mixture were extracted using a filter syringe and analyzed on a gas chromatographer equipped with an HP-5 capillary column to determine the yield of trans-β-nitrostyrene. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst characterization The dual-functional acid-base catalyst was synthesized by the sequence illustrated in Scheme 1 . First, CBAP-1 was synthesized via the Friedel-Crafts reaction of triphenylbenzene and terephthaloyl chloride, followed by functionalization with ethylenediamine to obtain CBAP-1(EDA) [36]. Then, the functionalization of the CBAP-1(EDA) with sulfonic acid produced the dual-functional acid-base catalyst CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H). Acid-functionalized CBAP-1(SO3H) was also synthesized for comparison of its catalytic activity. The chemical structure and properties of both the parent and functionalized polymer materials were investigated using FT-IR, EA, XPS, powder XRD, and N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm analysis. The FT-IR spectra in Fig. 1 show that the parent CBAP-1 presents the characteristic carbonyl peak at 1715cm−1. After functionalization with sulfonic acid, new characteristic bands are observed at 626, 1027, and 1172cm−1, which are assignable to C-S stretching vibrations and the symmetric and asymmetric OSO stretching vibrations of the SO3H groups, respectively [38–40]. CBAP-1(EDA) does not present any carbonyl stretching band around 1715cm−1 and shows asymmetric and symmetric aliphatic CH stretching vibrations (2926 and 2854cm−1) by the −CH2 CH2- moiety, and CN stretching vibrations (1052cm−1). In addition, a NH stretching broad band (around 3330cm−1) is found overlapped with OH stretching band (3400cm−1) caused by the trapping of water molecule during the washing process [41–43]. These results clearly indicate that the EDA is fully grafted onto CBAP-1 [44,45]. The dual-functionalized CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H) shows OSO stretching vibrations at 1158cm−1 from the sulfonamate group, indicating the presence of a −SO3H group directly attached to the amine moiety of the CBAP-1(EDA) polymer. The CBAP-1(EDA) was found to contain 78.98% C, 7.20% H, and 13.14% N, which agree well with the theoretical estimates (79.59%C, 7.16% H, and 13.26% N), and the density of amine groups in CBAP-1(EDA) was calculated to be 9.38mmolg−1. CBAP-1(SO3H) was found to contain 76.33% C, 3.94% H, and 4.05% S, while CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H) was found to contain 71.34% C, 6.94% H, 10.82% N, and 3.84% S. The density of acid groups in CBAP-1(SO3H) was calculated to be 1.27mmolg−1, whereas the densities of the sulfonic acid and amine groups in CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H) were calculated to be 1.20 and 7.73mmolg−1, respectively. The nature of the chemical bonding and the presence of functional groups in the developed polymers were also examined by high-resolution XPS, as shown in Fig. 2 . The C 1s deconvoluted XPS spectrum of CBAP-1 (Fig. 2a) shows two different binding energies at 284.3 and 286.7eV that can be assigned to the sp2 carbon and CO bonds, whereas the O 1s XPS fitting (Fig. 2b) shows a CO group with a binding energy of 532.9eV [46]. The deconvoluted XPS of the S 2p core level spectrum in the CBAP-1(SO3H) (Fig. 2c) shows a strong binding energy peak at 168.8eV ascribed to the SO3 2− moiety from the presence of −SO3H groups [47]. The N 1s fitting XPS spectrum (Fig. 2d) of CBAP-1(EDA) shows a binding energy peak at 399.1eV, which can be ascribed to −NH- and −NH2 groups. In the case of CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H), the N 1s core level spectrum (Fig. 2e) shows binding energies that indicate primary/secondary nitrogen (398.6eV) and tertiary nitrogen (400.2eV), whereas the S 2p core level spectrum (Fig. 2f) shows a SO3 2− moiety binding energy peak at 168.6eV. The presence of −SO3H groups and the newly observed tertiary nitrogen binding energy peak indicate that the sulfonic acid group is strongly attached to the secondary amine moiety of CBAP-1(EDA). Therefore, both the FT-IR and XPS results evidence the successful synthesis of single- and dual-functionalized porous covalent organic polymer catalysts. Powder XRD analysis of all the developed polymer materials (Fig. 3 a) does not show any strong diffraction peaks, indicating an amorphous structure, and only three broad peaks at approximately 10, 22, and 42° owing to disorder linkage, intrinsic flexibility, and direct ring-ring interactions [48]. The porosities of the prepared catalytic materials were analyzed using N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77K. The N2 isotherms of all the materials (Fig. 3b) show type-I behavior with strong adsorption in the low-pressure region owing to the microporosity of the materials. Furthermore, the desorption shows hysteresis due to swelling of the networks upon reversible and/or irreversible gas uptake in the pores [49]. The specific BET surface areas of CBAP-1, CBAP-1(SO3H), CBAP-1(EDA), and CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H) were calculated to be 872, 601, 471, and 310m2 g−1, respectively, and these decreasing BET surface areas are most likely due to the stepwise functionalization of CBAP-1. 3.2 Catalytic tests in one-pot cascade CC bond-forming reactions The catalytic properties of the dual-functional CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H) in one-pot cascade CC bond-forming reactions comprising an acid-catalyzed deacetylation and two different base-catalyzed reactions (Knoevenagel condensation and Henry reactions) were investigated (Scheme 2 ). 3.2.1 Deacetylation-Knoevenagel reaction First, CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H) was tested as a catalyst for the one-pot deacetylation-Knoevenagel condensation reaction, and the results are shown in Table 1 . Mechanistically, the reaction involves two steps; benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal (A) is deacetylated to a benzaldehyde intermediate (B) via acid catalysis, and intermediate B undergoes base-catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation with malononitrile to give benzalmalononitrile (C). In order to determine the role of both the acidic and basic functionality of the catalyst for this CC bond-forming cascade reaction, the reaction was carried out without a catalyst and with CBAP-1 alone, which give ∼28 and 30%, respectively, of the benzaldehyde product after 2h at 70°C. Furthermore, the reaction does not proceed to the Knoevenagel condensation (Table 1, entries 1–2). In the presence of the base-functionalized catalyst (CBAP-1(EDA)), the reaction reaches only 29% conversion of A with a 27% yield of the final product C (Table 1, entry 3). This moderate deacetylation occurs due to the presence of water in the reaction medium. Conversely, when the reaction is performed in one pot with the dual-functional CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H) catalyst, deacetylation followed by Knoevenagel condensation proceeds smoothly to afford the final product C in 100% yield after 2h (Table 1, entry 4). For comparison, homogeneous chlorosulfonic acid and the catalyst with only acid groups (CBAP-1- SO3H) were tested. These systems achieve 100% conversion of A to B in 2h, but do not proceed further to the Knoevenagel condensation to form the final product C (Table 1, entries 5–6). The reaction was also carried out with a mixture of basic CBAP-1(EDA) and chlorosulfonic acid. This system affords only a 73% yield of product C because the homogeneous chlorosulfonic acid diffuses into the pores of CBAP-1(EDA), reducing the ability of the basic sites to promote the Knoevenagel condensation and form C (Table 1, entry 7). The adjacency of the acidic sites and basic sites not only promotes the deacetylation process but also plays a vital role in the formation of the imine intermediate, subsequently promoting the nucleophilic attack by malononitrile to form the product C [50,51]. These results clearly demonstrate that the adjacent acidic and basic sites in heterogeneous catalysts such as in CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H) effectively promote one-pot CC bond-forming cascade reactions. The catalyst loading, reaction temperature, and kinetic profiles for the CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H)-catalyzed one-pot deacetylation-Knoevenagel condensation reactions were also investigated. The conversion of A and the Knoevenagel product of C increases with increasing catalyst loading of the reaction medium up to 80mg (Fig. 4 a). When the temperature is decreased from 70 to 50°C, A is fully converted within 2h, but the final product yield decreases (Table 1 entry 8) implying that the activation energy barrier for the Knoevenagel condensation is higher than that for the deacetylation process. To examine the kinetic profile of the reaction, we plotted the yields of A, B, and C over CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H) against time (Fig. 4b), showing that the conversion of A and the formation of C occur via the formation of intermediate B in a sequential manner. The results observed reveal that 80mg of the dual-functionalized CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H) catalyst converts 4mmol of benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal completely into benzalmalononitrile via the formation of a benzaldehyde intermediate within 80min at 70°C. 3.2.2 Deacetylation-Henry reaction The catalytic performance of CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H) towards the deacetylation-Henry reaction was also tested, and its activity was compared with those of CBAP-1, CBAP-1(EDA), and CBAP-1(SO3H) (Table 2 , entries 1–7). When CBAP-1, CBAP-1(EDA), and CBAP-1(SO3H) catalyst are used (Table 2, entries 1–3, 5–7), similar catalytic activities to those for the one-pot deacetylation-Knoevenagel condensation reaction are observed (See Table 1). Thus, only the coexistence of acid and base functionality provides excellent catalytic activity (100% conversion of A) with a 97% yield of the final Henry product D (β-nitrostyrene) (Table 2, entry 4) in 7h at 80°C. The catalytic activity of CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H) for conversion to the final product D gradually decreases as the temperature decreases from 80 to 60°C (Table 2, entry 8). The temperature dependences of the product yields shown in Table 1 and 2 indicate that more energy and catalytically active basic sites are required to promote the base-catalyzed Henry reaction than those required for the Knoevenagel condensation reaction. In addition, the conversion of A and the yield of D increases with an increase in catalyst loading from 60mg and reaches a maximum at 120mg of CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H) (Fig. 5 a). The time course of the deacetylation-Henry reaction over CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H) (Fig. 5b) shows that the deacetylation of A proceeds completely to yield B within 1h, but the second step of the base-catalyzed Henry reaction occurs more slowly and the yield of D reaches 98% at 7h. Thus, the optimum conditions for the one-pot deacetylation-Henry reaction are CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H) (120mg), substrate A (4mmol), nitromethane (4mL), deionized water (1mL) at 80°C for 7h. 3.2.3 Recyclability of the CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H) Easy separation, good recyclability, and long lifetime stability are essential for the application of heterogeneous catalysts in large-scale industrial applications. The recyclability of CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H) was examined in both the one-pot deacetylation-Knoevenagel condensation (Fig. 6 a) and the deacetylation-Henry (Fig. 6b) reaction under their optimized conditions (See the reaction conditions in Fig. 6 footnote). After completion of the first run, the solid catalyst was separated by centrifugation, washed with ethyl acetate (3×10mL), and dried in high vacuum for 1h. Meanwhile, the filtrate solution was concentrated to 10mL and the conversion of A and the yields of C and/or D were monitored by gas chromatography. Finally, the recovered catalyst was reused for another six consecutive cycles. The active sites of the covalently attached acid-base functionalities in the CBAP-1 structure are well maintained under the optimal reaction conditions, and the same catalytic activity is largely preserved for up to seven cycles. The stability of the catalyst after the seventh use in the deacetylation-Henry reaction was also confirmed using FT-IR, EA, and N2 sorption isotherm analyses. The FT-IR spectrum of the reused catalyst does not show any noticeable change in the stretching bands as compared with those of the fresh catalyst. EA of the reused CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H) after the seventh deacetylation-Henry reaction cycle showed 71.08% C, 6.86% H, 10.95% N, and 3.76% S. The N2 sorption isotherm of the reused catalyst almost exactly matches that of the fresh catalyst. These observations clearly prove that CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H) offers excellent reusability with high activity in cascade CC bond-forming reactions. 3.2.4 Reaction mechanism of the CC bond-forming reactions over CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H) Considering the catalytic activity observed for CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H) in the one-pot cascade CC bond-forming reactions and previous literature reports [24,50–52], a two-step reaction mechanism is proposed, as described in Scheme 3 . In the step 1 deacetylation, the CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H) catalyst donates a proton to benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal (A) to form a protonated benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal intermediate (i) followed by methanol removal to give intermediate (ii). Subsequently, a water molecule in the reaction mixture reacts with intermediate (ii) to give benzaldehyde (B). Step 2 shows the base-catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation and Henry reactions to form the products C and D, respectively. 3.2.4.1 Knoevenagel condensation reaction Benzaldehyde (B) is activated by the acid sites of CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H) and attacks the amine moiety of the catalyst to form the imine intermediate (v). The imine intermediate abstracts a proton from malononitrile by the acid functionality on the catalyst, and the resulting carbanion attacks the imine carbon to form intermediate (vi), followed by the Knoevenagel product being removed from (vi). 3.2.4.2 Henry reaction Similar to the first step of the previous Knoevenagel condensation mechanism, the intermediate imine (v) is formed. Similarly, the imine intermediate abstract a proton from nitromethane aided by the acid functionality on the catalyst, and the resulting carbanion attacks the imine carbon to form intermediate (vii), followed by the Henry product being removed from (vii), and the catalyst is regenerated for further cycles. 4 Conclusions A cooperative dual-functional porous covalent organic polymer catalyst having amine and sulfonic acid group was prepared via a simple Friedel-Crafts reaction. The dual-functional catalyst showed excellent catalytic performance with 100% substrate conversion and 97% yield of the final products in cascade reactions comprising deacetylation and Knoevenagel condensation or Henry reaction steps. The coexistence of acidic and basic sites on the solid support in close proximity achieved enhanced activation of the electrophiles and nucleophiles in the reactions. The catalyst could be recovered easily by simple centrifugation and was reusable in both reactions for at least seven sequential runs without losing activity. The dual-functional porous polymer catalysts are easy to prepare and exhibit high stability, and are thus expected to offer new opportunities for a diverse range of one-pot cascade reactions in the future.

        "dc:description": "A porous dual-functional acid-base covalent organic polymer catalyst (CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H)) was prepared using a facile Friedel-Crafts reaction of triphenylbenzene and terephthaloyl chloride to prepare the polymer backbone (CBAP-1) followed by functionalization with ethylenediamine (EDA) and a simple chlorosulfonic acid treatment. The resultant polymeric catalyst and its functional moieties were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), elemental analysis (EA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), and N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm analyses. The catalytic activity of CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H) was then assessed for one-pot cascade CC bond-forming reactions involving deacetylation-Knoevenagel condensation and Henry reactions. Compared with the homogeneous catalyst and CBAP-1 functionalized with just acid or base, CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H) showed superior catalytic activity and selectivity, and was found to be reusable for up to seven consecutive runs. A catalytic mechanism for CC bond-forming reactions over CBAP-1(EDA-SO3H) was proposed.",
