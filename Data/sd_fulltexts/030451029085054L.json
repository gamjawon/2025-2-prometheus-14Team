Results show that the active phase, characterized by a yv^y^ ratio of 2:1 and an IR band at 995 cm\"1, does not interact directly with the titania surface, but rather with a V^-modified surface. It is suggested that these V^ surface sites act as the 'clinging' sites for stabilization of an upper active phase. The same active phase is found on both anatase- and rutile-based samples. Competing migration towards the bulk of these V^ sites on the rutile sample causes a slight decrease in catalyst performance. In particular enhanced formation of the intermediate product, phthalide, is observed. Introduction Va05-Ti02(anatase) is a well-known catalytic system [1 5] showing a specific support active phase interaction. It is generally agreed that a bidimensional amorphous layer of Vv forms on the surface of the support [6-9]; this so-called 'monolayer' is considered to be the active phase. It is suggested that the excess V-oxide deposited remains as crystalline VgOg, which is thought to be inactive. The formation of a paracrystalline VgOg upper layer, however, also has been shown [7] and the presence ofV^ on the surface recognized [ 10-13], but its importance in the catalytic cycle is usually neglected. The structure of TiOg is important in determining the characteristics of the active phase [14]. Only Ti02( anatase) is thought to create the monolayer giving rise to a highly active and selective catalyst in o-xylene oxidation. However, there is no generally accepted theory about how TiOg influences V205. According to Vejux and Courtine [14], the fit between the (010) planes of VgOg and the structure of anatase results in a preferential exposure of Vv=0 groups on the surface [15,16]. Since these groups are considered to be the active sites, this explains why the catalytic performance of V/Ti/0 catalysts is better than that of ^-fls- Other authors, 0304-5102/90/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 222 however, believe that the active phase has a different structure as compared with crystalline Va05. They postulate a monolayer consisting of (i) mono- dispersed V04 units located at the cationic sites with two terminal oxygens (V==0) and two bridging oxygens (V 0 Ti) [17,18]; (ii) an amorphous disordered layer ofV 0 polyhedra [19-21] that forms in a 'wetting* process ofVaOg by TiOg, the difference in surface free energy being the driving force of the migration [22]; (iii) a strongly disordered vanadium oxide species preferentially deposited at the edges of the titania [23]; and (iv) patches of vanadium pentoxide on the surface of the support [24]. In previous studies [25-28] we have shown the highly complex nature of surface vanadium oxide species on titania, evidencing the presence of several types of species and, in particular, of non-negligible amounts of superficial strongly interacting V^ species. The similar catalytic behavior of impregnated catalysts utilizing rutile and anatase has also been demon- strated [25]. Therefore, questions still remain about the formation of the active phase and its real nature. Reported in this paper are the results of research carried out to characterize vanadium oxide on anatase or rutile TiOg prepared using a mechanical-mixing method. Although this preparation method is seldom used in studies reported in the literature, we choose to employ it for this study because, in spite of its intrinsic simplicity, it allows a better understanding of the solid state reactions of the spreading of VgOg on the support surface and its reduction to V^, without interference of any other chemical phenomena. It also is a preparation method used for the synthesis of industrial catalysts for o-xylene oxidation and allows very active/selective catalysts to be prepared. Experimental Catalyst preparation The catalysts were prepared by mechanical mixing and grinding (1 min) ofTiOg and Vg05 (Carlo Erba reagent grade). Generally, 7.7wt.% Va05 was used, an amount typical for industrial preparations. Anatase (9.6 n^g\"1) and rutile (8.9m2 g~~1) prepared by TiCl4 hydrolysis were used in order to obtain highly pure TiOa supports and to exclude interferences from doping. After mixing and grinding, the samples were calcined in air at 500 C for 16 h or longer. Hereinafter, the following notation will be utilized: A indicates catalysts prepared using an anatase TiOg support and R indicates catalysts prepared using a rutile TiOg support. Catalytic tests The catalysts were tested in a conventional laboratory apparatus with a tubular fixed bed reactor working at atmospheric pressure, and on-line gas chromatographic analysis of reagent and product compositions [25,26]. The standard reactant composition was 1.5% o-xylene, 20.5% Og and 78% N2. The 223 catalyst (0.52 g) was loaded as grains (0.250-0.420 mm). A thermocouple, placed in the middle of the catalyst bed, was used to verify that the axial temperature profile was within 5 C. The catalytic results refer to the stable catalytic behavior obtained after at least 60 h on stream under typical reaction conditions for o-xylene oxidation. Chemical analysis The samples (about 0.5 g) were moistened with 50ml of a room temperature dilute (4 M) H2SC>4 solution for 15 min under stirring and then filtered. The amount of vanadium was determined separately in the filtered solution and in the residual sample dissolved in boiling concentrated HaS04 (16M). The total amounts and the valence state of vanadium were determ- ined by a titrimetric method as previously reported [25,26]. The vanadium species extracted by the room temperature dilute sulphuric acid solution will be, hereinafter, called 'soluble' or 'weakly-interacting' species, whereas the remaining species determined after dissolving the residue are called 'in- soluble' or 'strongly-interacting\" species. The dissolution and chemical analysis procedures were chosen after preliminary tests with reference samples [25]. Characterization X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) (powder technique) were obtained using Ni-filtered CuKo. radiation and a Philips computer-controlled in- strument. Surface areas were determined using the BET method and a Carlo Erba Sorptomatic instrument. A Perkin Elmer 7200 Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer was used to record the IR spectra using the KBr disc technique. Calibrated amounts ofV Ti 0 samples (around 0.1% w/w with respect to KBr) were used and electronically calibrated subtraction of the TiO'2 contribution to the spectrum was done. Results The results of XRD analysis of A and R samples after grinding (a), after calcination (air, 500 C, 16 h) (b), after the catalytic tests (c) and after the catalytic tests and consecutive oxidation (air, 400 C, 4h) (d) are summarized in Table 1. Only a small decrease in the relative intensity of crystalline V205 diffraction lines after calcination was observed, while after the catalytic test and after consecutive oxidation no crystalline vanadium oxide could be detected. The apparent higher relative intensity of Vg05 XRD reflections in the R sample in comparison to that in the A sample derives from the different intensities of the mean peaks of anatase TiOa and rutile TiOg. The intensity ratio (101) anatase: (100) rutile is approximately 4:1 [29]. In all cases the diffraction lines relative to rutile in A samples and anatase in R samples were negligible and did not change after the catalytic tests. For the rutile sample, a decrease in the cell volume was also observed after catalytic tests, indicating the formation of a V^ solid solution in the rutile matrix, in agreement with literature data [30]. 224 TABLE 1 Relative intensities % (///o) of the main X-ray diffraction lines of A and R samples after grinding (a), after calcination (air, 500 C, 16 h) (b), after catalytic tests (c) and after the catalytic tests and consecutive oxidation (air, 400 C, 4 h) (d) Ph saiun A, ase npletreated(a) (b) (c) hkl= d.(A)=I/V =WodODA ^odODA '/'odODA TiOz anatfl101 3.51100 100 100 100 ise200 1.8933 28 27 28 004 2.3822 25 24 25 TiOg rutile110 3.24100 1 1 2 211 1.6950 101 2.4941 VsA001 4.381007 5 110 3.4090 6 4 400 2.8865 4 3 (d) ^od01)A 100 27 24 1 B, (a) \"'odOOR 8 2 100 44 47 29 13 10 (b) ^/^odOOM 8 2 100 43 46 25 10 8 (c) ^od<x B 6 1 100 38 44 (d) ^/^odOOBt 6 1 100 37 43 Reference values taken from the relative ASTM tables (4-0477 for TiOg anatase, 4-0551 for TiOa rutile, 9-387 for VzOs). The chemical analyses of the samples after calcination (Table 2) indicate the presence of insoluble V^. The amounts for anatase and rutile samples were slightly smaller than those necessary to achieve a complete coverage of the TiOa surface (0.9-1.0 wt.%), assuming a value of about 0.1 wt.% ofVgOg per m2 of surface for monolayer coverage. The evolution of the amount of insoluble V^ as a function of the time of calcination for an anatase sample (Fig. 1) shows that the amount of V^ does not further increase significantly after the first 24 h calcination. This indicates that the TABLE 2 Chemical analyses of A and R samples after grinding (a), after calcination (air, 500 C, 16 h) (b), after catalytic tests (c) and after the catalytic tests and consecutive oxidation (air, 400 C, 4h)(d) Sample Chemical analyses\" Mean valence state of soluble fraction1' V^insol.

Symbols, experimental conditions and note as for Fig. 2. phthalic anhydride selectivity of the R sample is slightly smaller because of the higher yields of phthalide. Phthalide is an intermediate in the pathway of phthalic anhydride synthesis (Scheme 1). When the soluble fraction of vanadium is removed by washing, the catalysts become less active, but are still more active than pure anatase or rutile TiOa (Fig. 4). The activity is roughly proportional to the amount of surface V^ sites [25]. The washed A samples after calcination are slightly less active than A samples (washed) after catalytic tests (Fig. 4), indicating a slight increase in surface V^ sites after this treatment, in agreement with chemical analysis data (Table 2). On the contrary, a considerable decrease in activity was found for the cor- responding R samples (Fig. 4), indicating that surface V^ sites migrate towards the bulk, forming a solid solution in the rutile structure, in agreement with XRD data. EPR data [25,31] also confirm these indications. In the soluble part of the discharged catalysts an analogous mean valence state for both anatase and rutile samples (Table 2) is noted. This value (around 4.7) corresponds to a VVV^ atomic ratio of 2:1, taking into account a small fraction ofVaOs present in the R sample as shown by FT-IR data (Fig. 5 A). A clear difference between the two supports is that the total phthalic anhydride 227 Conv. (300 C), % Fig. 4.

Experimental conditions as for Fig. 2. amount of the soluble part is lower in the case of the rutile catalyst because of the larger insoluble V^ fraction. The FT IR spectra in the v(V==0) region of the discharged catalyst (A, R) are reported in Fig. 5 (the TiOg contribution has been subtracted from the spectra).

The first, corresponding to the symmetrical stretching of ^^==0 in crystalline VgOg, is almost negligible, while the 995 cm~1 band is the most intense in spectra of both R and A catalysts. The intensity of the band at 995 cm\"1 is approximately propor- tional to the total amount of the soluble fraction of vanadium with a V^V^ ratio of 2:1. A rough correlation was, in fact, observed in several samples [31] between the intensity of the FT-IR band at 995 cm\"!, the amount of soluble vanadium fraction which could be attributed to the non-crystalline active species with a V^V^ ratio of 2:1 and the selectivity to phthalic anhydride in o-xylene oxidation. Chemical analyses (Table 2) and FT-IR data (Fig. 5c) of the discharged catalysts after consecutive calcination (air, 400 C for 4h) showed that they are relatively stable to oxidation. The mean valence state in the soluble fraction remains below 5.0, the value corresponding to complete re-oxidation, and in the FT-IR spectra the band centered at 995 cm~1 is still present, but the relative intensity of the bands at 1020cm\"1 (Va(V===0) in crystalline VgOg) and at 1010 cm~1 (reasonably attributed to an intermediate phase in going from the active phase to crystalline VsOg) increases. The phases which form by oxidation are not XRD detectable (Table 1). The effect is much more drastic in R samples than in A samples, suggesting in the latter an increase in the stabilization of the reduced phase characterized by the IR band at 995 cm~1. No oxidation of insoluble V\"^ occurs in either the R or A samples, indicating the very strong stabilization as a consequence of the interaction with the TiOa surface. Discussion Modification of the TiOg surface by V^ ions Chemical analyses show the formation of relevant amounts of insoluble V^ species by interaction of V ions with the surface TiOg sites. The formation of these V^ sites occurs during calcination in air and in the absence of any reducing agent. The redox and chemical (solubility) properties of the V^ sites are dramatically altered by the interaction with the TiOg surface, in comparison with V^-oxide; for example, Va04 easily oxidizes to V^oxide even at 100 C, and is soluble in dilute HaSO^. XRD (Table 1) and EPR [31] data clearly exclude the formation of a solid solution in A samples, whereas this effect is present in R samples. The formation of these V^ surface sites, at least for A samples, occurs by a specific reaction between TiOg surface sites and ^ sites. This chemical reaction is the driving force for the spontaneous reduction of V\" in oxidizing conditions and for its surface migration. In fact, the reaction does not occur only in the regions of contact between TiOg and Vy,0s particles. The grain size of the two oxides does not have a significant influence on the amount of V^ determined after long term calcination (100 h). Furthermore, a change of the VaOg^OgW/w ratio from 7:93 (as used in this work) to 93:7 does not result in a significant 229 change in the amount of V^ per m2 of TiOa surface. These indications suggest that V^ does not form only at the interface between TiOg and VgOs particles, but may 'walk' on the surface to specific TiOz sites where they react, forming V^. Furthermore, these data suggest that the value found for anatase samples (about 0.1% wt. per m2 of surface area) corresponds to the maximum amount of V^ on the surface of TiOg. This surface coverage, assuming a good distribution of V^ ions, indicates a mean vanadium to vanadium distance of about 4 A. This distance corresponds to that expected on the basis of a reaction model (assuming the (010) plane of TiOa as the predominant one on the surface of a low surface area sample) [32] of vanadium ions with two neighboring Ti OH groups and formation of a distorted octahedral vanadyl group (as shown by EPR analysis [25,27,28]) which interacts with underlying Ti^ ions. The mean distance of 4 A indicates that some bridging Ti 0 Ti oxygens and Ti4'1' ions still remain available on the surface modified by V^ for possible secondary interaction with the upper layer (soluble fraction), but the main interaction of the upper layer occurs with surface vanadyl groups. In R samples after calcination, the data for surface reactivity (Fig. 4) indicate that surface V\"^ ions are present in an amount quite comparable to that in A samples, but these V^ ions are relatively unstable and during the catalytic tests tend to migrate towards the bulk of rutile TiOg, forming a solid solution, as confirmed by the change in the cell parameters (XRD analysis). These surface V^ ions (insoluble fraction) also may be formed during the catalytic tests [26]. In the R sample it is thus probable that a competition exists during the catalytic tests between formation of these V^ sites and their tendency to migrate towards the bulk of rutile TiOg. When the steady -state catalytic behavior is reached, 'clusters' of V^ are present in the R sample as clearly shown by ESR characterization [31], in contrast to well dispersed vanadyl ions present on the surface of sample A after similar treatment [31]. The competition with bulk migration thus limits the possibility of surface diffusion of vanadium ions, leaving probably a large fraction of surface uncovered on the rutile sample, even after attainment of steady-state catalytic behavior. Support effect on active phase behavior We have shown in the previous part that during the calcination step some V^ ions react with TiOg, forming V^ sites. The rest of the vanadium oxide remains as such (crystalline VgC^) on the surface, as clearly shown by IR and XRD measurements. This part of the initial vanadium, however, transforms during the catalytic tests, giving rise to the active phase for o-xylene oxidation to phthalic anhydride, with a parallel increase in both activity and selectivity. This active phase is XRD amorphous; it is probably characterized by a ^/V^ ratio near to 2:1 and an IR band at 995 cm\"1. This IR band may be attributed to stretching of the ^=0 bond in a distorted octahedral environment. The lowering in frequency, as compared with 230 VgV=0 in Vg05 (1020 cm\"1), can be tentatively explained by the presence of V^ in the neighbouring octahedral 'VV. Our data suggest the presence of the same active phase on both rutile and anatase-based catalysts. The catalytic performance of the two samples is comparable, as well as the IR, XRD and chemical analysis data. The principal difference in the catalytic behavior is a slightly reduced oxidizing power of the R samples, giving rise to the formation of an higher amount of phthalide, clearly a product intermediate in the synthesis of phthalic anhydride: However, Table 2 and Fig. 5 suggest some differences between A and R catalysts, which may be summarized as follows: (a) A smaller amount of active phase (soluble fraction of Table 2) is present in the rutile sample. (b) The active phase on the rutile support is slightly less stable towards reoxidation, as shown by the tests of consecutive calcination after catalytic tests (Fig. 5). However, it should be noted that even increasing the initial amount of Va05 in the catalyst R in order to compensate the loss of surface vanadium oxide caused by migration toward the bulk of V\"^ ions, no improvements in the catalytic performances can be observed [31]. This indicates that the difference observed in the catalytic behavior between the A and R samples cannot be attributed to a smaller amount of active phase on the surface of the R sample due to the partial migration of vanadium toward the bulk of the rutile matrix. These data thus suggest the probable presence of the same active phase on rutile- and anatase-based catalysts, but a lower effect of support-induced stabilization on the rutile-based catalysts. These catalysts show a slight decrease in catalytic performance in o-xylene oxidation and, in particular, an enhanced formation of the intermediate product, phthalide. As previously discussed, this active phase does not interact directly with the TiOg surface, but rather with the surface modified by V^ ions. It was also shown that the mean amount of V^ sites on the rutile surface is probably lower than on the anatase surface, due to the tendency of V^ to migrate toward the bulk of the rutile structure. On the other hand, on the rutile surface 'clusters' of V^ ions are present, in contrast to isolated vanadyl ions on the anatase surface. It seems thus reasonable to indicate a different type of interaction with the upper active phase between the A and R surfaces modified in a different manner by the V^ ions. It is thus also reasonable to suggest tentatively that the role of the crystalline structure of TiOg is not related to crystallographic fitting or wetting effects, as indicated in the literature [8,9,14,17,22], but rather to the ability to stabilize specific V^ surface sites which act as the 'clinging' sites for the upper active layer. We may also remark that no stable V^ sites could be detected on V^O^-Al-fla or -SiOg catalysts whose only treatment was calcination [33]. It is well known that these supports exhibit poorer performances in o-xylene conversion to phthalic anhydride [18]. 231 References 1 M. S. Wainwright and N. R. Foster, Catal. Rev. Sci.

Results show that the active phase, characterized by a Vv:VIV ratio of 2:1 and an IR band at 995 cm−1, does not interact directly with the titania surface, but rather with a VIV-modified surface. It is suggested that these VIV surface sites act as the ‘clinging’ sites for stabilization of an upper active phase. The same active phase is found on both anatase- and rutile-based samples. Competing migration towards the bulk of these VIV sites on the rutile sample causes a slight decrease in catalyst performance. In particular enhanced formation of the intermediate product, phthalide, is observed. References 1 M.S. Wainwright N.R. Foster Catal. Rev. Sci. Technol. 19 1979 211 2 G.C. Bond P. Konig J.
