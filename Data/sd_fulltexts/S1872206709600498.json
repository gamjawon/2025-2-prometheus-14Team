DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(09)60049-8 Influence of Ni Species of Ni/AC Catalyst on Its Desulfurization Performance at Low Temperature GUO Jiaxiu 1,2 , LIANG Juan 2 , CHU Yinghao 1,2 , YIN Huaqiang 1,2, *, CHEN Yaoqiang 2,3 1 College of Architecture and Environment, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610065, Sichuan, China 2 National Engineering Technology Research Center for Flue Gas Desulfurization, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610065, Sichuan, China 3 College of Chemistry, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, Sichuan, China Abstract: A series of Ni/AC catalyst samples were prepared by excessive impregnation, and the desulfurization activity of Ni/AC calcined at different temperatures was investigated. The Ni species on the Ni/AC catalyst calcined at different temperatures were studied by X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The characterization results showed that the Ni species on the catalyst calcined at 400 °C is Ni 2 O 3 . After calcination at 550 °C, NiO species is formed on the activated carbon. NiO and Ni coexist on the Ni/AC catalyst calcined at 800 °C, and only pure Ni species is observed after calcination at 1 000 °C. This suggested that Ni can form different chemical states on the Ni/AC catalyst calcined at different temperatures. The desulfurization test results showed that the catalysts calcined at 550 and 800 °C exhibit good desulfurization activity, whereas the catalyst calcined at 400 °C has poor activity, indicating that different chemical states of Ni on the Ni/AC catalyst show different desulfurization performance, and NiO is the main active phase of the Ni/AC catalyst. Key words: nickel; activated carbon; supported catalyst; chemical state; desulfurization; nickel oxide Coal burning is the main source of the atmospheric pollu- tion in China, and SO 2 is one of the major pollutants. Control- ling SO 2 emission from power plants has become a more ur- gent task. On the other hand, the emission limits of SO 2 are becoming more and more stringent. To resolve the problem, engineers and researchers have made efforts to improve the current technology of flue gas desulfurization (FGD) and de- veloped novel FGD technologies with resourceful utilization, low costs, and high efficiency. Some of these technologies are based on catalytic processes, and catalysts like vanadium pentaoxide or bauxite are used for the conversion of SO 2 into sulphuric acid [1]. Activated carbon (AC) has high stability, large surface area, abundant micropore structure, and surface oxide species and can be used as a catalyst or carrier in gas-solid reactions. Considering these facts, AC may serve as a good support for SO 2 removal catalysts. For decades the adsorption of SO 2 over AC has been proposed as a viable alternative because of its high SO 2 removal efficiency, cheap investment, and easy re- generation [2]. Several studies have reported that AC loaded with metal can significantly enhance the desulfurization activ- ity of AC [3]. A granular Cu/AC catalyst has been investi- gated for desulfurization and exhibited high activity [4]. Liu et al. [5] also have studied the desulfurization activity of CuO/AC and found high desulfurization activity in the tem- perature range of 120–250 °C. Fe/AC that was prepared from AC-supported Fe 2 O 3 has higher desulfurization activity than AC or Fe 2 O 3 at 200 °C for flue gas SO 2 removal [6]. A lot of studies have reported the characteristics and behavior of Ni catalysts supported on AC in many industry processes such as hydrogenation, hydrogenolysis of hydrocarbons, and steam reforming [7–9]. Nickel supported on AC was used for ad- sorptive desulfurization of diesel by Selvavathi et al. [10]. It has been reported that the carrier can strongly influence the surface morphology and electronic structure of metal particles and directly affect the catalyst stability and catalytic activity [11]. The aim of this paper was to prepare a series of Ni/AC catalysts by excessive impregnation and evaluate their desul- furization performance. A hypothesis about the relation be- tween chemical states of Ni on the catalyst and desulfurization GUO Jiaxiu et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2010, 31: 278–282 activity was proposed. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation The Ni/AC catalyst was prepared by the excessive impreg- nation method. A commercial AC (specific surface area 831 m 2 /g, Lvye Co., Henan) was pretreated by strong nitric acid and then immersed into excessive nickel nitrate aqueous solu- tion, followed by pouring out the excessive liquid and drying. The Ni content of the catalyst was 0.92% by inductively cou- pled plasma emission spectrometric (ICP) detection. The dried catalyst samples were calcined at 400, 550, 800, and 1 000 ºC in pure nitrogen atmosphere. These catalyst samples were labeled Ni/AC-400, Ni/AC-550, Ni/AC-800, and Ni/AC-1000, respectively. The original activated carbon (AC) was used as a comparative sample. 1.2 Catalyst activity evaluation The desulfurization activity of the Ni/AC catalyst was evaluated in a continuous flow multiple fixed-bed microreac- tor. The flow rate of the simulated flue gas mixture was con- trolled by a rotor flow meter before entering a blender. The flue gas mixture contained 0.3% SO 2 , 9.1% O 2 , 14% water vapor, and N 2 (balance). The gas space velocity (SV) was 2 000 h –1 . The test temperature was 90 ºC. 1.3 Catalyst characterization The crystal structure of the catalyst was determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a DX-2000 diffractometer using Cu K . radiation ( = 0.154 06 nm) at 40 kV and 25 mA. The XRD data were recorded for 2 values between 10° and 90° with an interval of 0.03°. The crystalline phases were identified by comparison with the reference data from the International Center for Diffraction Data (JCPDS). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on an XSAM-800 spectrometer (KRATOS) with Al K . radiation under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) at 12 kV and 12 mA. Energy calibration was done by recording the core level spectra of Au 4f 7/2 (84.0 eV) and Ag 3d 5/2 (368.3 eV). 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Desulfurization performance of the Ni/AC catalyst The desulfurization performance of the Ni/AC catalyst cal- cined at different temperatures is presented in Fig. 1, ex- pressed as the relation between SO 2 removal rate and reaction time. The sulfur capacity (the total amount of SO 2 in the re- moval rate range of 90% 100%) and its corresponding reac- tion time are listed in Table 1. It can be seen that the samples calcined at different temperatures have different desulfuriza- tion performance. Compared with AC, the Ni/AC catalyst exhibits good desulfurization activity and high sulfur capacity, showing that the Ni component can significantly change the desulfurization activity of AC. Under the same experimental conditions, the SO 2 removal rate over the Ni/AC-400 catalyst rapidly decreases to 90% in a short time (2.15 h), while the Ni/AC-800 catalyst can last longer (5.21 h). Their sulfur ca- pacities are 81 and 203 mg/g, respectively, showing that the catalyst samples calcined at different temperatures have dif- ferent catalytic activity. According to the results, the desulfu- rization activity of the catalyst samples from poor to excellent activity is in the order AC < Ni/AC-400 < Ni/AC-1000 < Ni/AC-550 < Ni/AC-800, which could be due to different Ni species on AC. 2.2 XRD and XPS results Figure 2 shows the XRD patterns of the Ni/AC catalyst samples calcined at different temperatures. It is noticed that the Ni/AC catalyst calcined at 400 °C has very broad diffrac- tion peaks, and no obvious NiO and/or pure Ni peaks are ob- served. The diffraction peaks of Ni 2 O 3 cannot be detected be- cause of a very low degree of crystallinity of Ni 2 O 3 [12]. Ni 2 O 3 normally forms during low temperature calcination [13], suggesting that decomposition of nickel nitrate in pure N 2 atmosphere at 400 °C could form Ni 2 O 3 , which can be proved by XPS.

Minor characteristic peaks of NiO at 2 = 43.29° and 51.26° and major characteristic peaks of Ni at 2 = 44.5°, 51.8°, and 76.5° (JCPDS 04-0850) are observed for the Ni/AC-800 catalyst, showing that nickel nitrate on AC can form pure Ni at 800 °C but most of crystalline NiO are formed. Only pure Ni is detected on Ni/AC-1000. It can be concluded that different Ni species can be formed on the Ni/AC catalyst calcined at different temperatures. In order to further clarify the valence state of Ni species on AC, all Ni/AC samples were characterized by XPS. The states of Ni species in the catalyst samples were evaluated by de- convolution of the Ni 2p region spectra using multiple Gaus- sian �tting functions, as shown in Fig. 3. The main peaks around 854.50 855.16 eV and satellite peaks at 860.98–861.56 eV are the spin-orbit split lines of Ni 2p 3/2 . The main peaks in the range 872.03–873.20 eV and accompanying satellite peaks at 878.39–879.97 eV correspond to the spin-orbit split lines of Ni 2p 1/2 . It was reported that the Ni 2p 3/2 binding energy of Ni 0 appears at 852.6 eV [14]. The main peaks of Ni 2p 3/2 in the range 853.9–854.9 eV and an accom- panying shake-up satellite peak at 860.8–862.8 eV were as- signed to Ni 2+ species [15,16] of NiO, while the Ni 2p 3/2 binding energies of 855.7–856.9 eV and 860.1–864.5 eV were assigned to the Ni–O bond of Ni 2 O 3 [17,18]. Zhao et al. [19] also assigned the binding energy 855.5 eV to Ni 2 O 3 on TiO 2-x B x . Under our experimental conditions, the Ni 2p 3/2 peaks of the Ni/AC-400 catalyst appear at 855.16 and 861.56 eV, and the Ni 2p 1/2 peaks appear at 872.70 and 879.29 eV, which belong to nickel oxide. Romero et al. [20] reported that Ni 2 O 3 can be generated on the Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst calcined at 400 °C in air. It can be proposed that this nickel oxide on AC belongs to Ni 2 O 3 . That is because all supports have the same porosity and the catalysts are prepared using the same ex- perimental procedure. The surface groups containing oxygen on the carbon support play a major role in the final metal dis- persion, resulting in the formation of Ni 2 O 3 species [21]. The appearance of peaks at binding energies of 855.45 and 862.18 eV for Ni 2p 3/2 and 873.20 and 879.97 eV for Ni 2p 1/2 together with the results of XRD proves the existence of Ni 2 O 3 and NiO on Ni/AC-550 in accordance with Lemonidou et al. [16] and Trigwell et al. [17]. For Ni/AC-800, the Ni 2p 3/2 binding energies of 854.50 and 860.98 eV and the Ni 2p 1/2 binding energies of 872.03 and 878.91 eV are attributed to NiO and Ni 0 , respectively, which is in agreement with the reference [22]. The Ni 2p 3/2 binding energies of 854.65 and 861.16 eV and the Ni 2p 1/2 binding energies of 872.12 and 878.39 eV fit very well with the results reported previously for zero valent metallic nickel [23]. Therefore, based on the above analysis, it can be concluded that the Ni/AC catalyst calcined at 400 ºC can form Ni 2 O 3 , NiO species are detected after Ni/AC calcination at 550 ºC, and pure Ni can be observed on the Ni/AC-800 catalyst. The Ni/AC calcined at 1 000 ºC fully forms pure Ni. These changes could be due to the surface chemistry properties of AC, especially the oxygen-containing functional groups of AC, which can influence the Ni valence state. Considering the results of desulfurization and different Ni chemical states, it is confirmed that the chemical states of Ni on AC can influence the desulfurization performance and NiO on AC possesses the best catalytic activity. 2.3 Ni species change before and after desulfurization In order to further confirm the change of Ni species on the Ni/AC catalyst, the characterization by XRD and XPS for Ni/AC-550 and Ni/AC-800 after desulfurization was carried out. The results are shown in Fig. 2 and 3. It is interesting to note that both samples exhibit an amorphous state. Small characteristic peaks of NiO are detected at 2 = 43.29° and 51.26°, indicating that the chemical state of Ni species on Ni/AC-800 was changed after desulfurization. The results of XPS indicate that the Ni 2p 3/2 peaks of Ni/AC-550 appear at 855.45 and 862.04 eV after desulfurization and the Ni 2p 1/2 peaks appear at 872.70 and 879.34 eV, which is close to the findings for Ni/AC-550 before desulfurization, suggesting that the Ni chemical state of Ni/AC-550 does not change after desulfurization. In the case of Ni/AC-800, the Ni 2p 3/2 peaks appear at 855.30 and 861.69 eV, and the Ni 2p 1/2 peaks appear at 872.93 and 879.86 eV after desulfurization, which is in agreement with the Ni 2p 3/2 and Ni 2p 1/2 binding energies of Ni 2 O 3 , indicating that the Ni chemical state changes after desulfurization. This could include the following chemical reactions: Ni + H 2 O NiO + H 2 (1) 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 In te n s ity 2 T/( o ) (1) (2) (4) � Ni R NiO (3) (5) (6) Fig. 2.

GUO Jiaxiu et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2010, 31: 278–282 Ni + 1/2O 2 NiO (2) 4NiO + O 2 Ni 2 O 3 (3) Reactions (1) and (2) are exothermic reactions [24], and Reaction (2) is a strong exothermic reaction. When water va- por is present in the feed gas mixture, Reaction (2) occurs. Water vapor containing oxygen can significantly enhance the reaction temperature and form more NiO, so that the catalyst at lower calcination temperature has a better desulfurization efficiency. 3 Conclusions Ni/AC calcined at different temperatures has different chemical states (Ni 2 O 3 , NiO, and Ni), which can lead to dif- ferent desulfurization performance. Ni/AC catalysts contain- ing NiO exhibit good catalytic activity at low reaction tem- perature, which suggests that NiO on the Ni/AC catalyst is the best active species for the desulfurization. The Ni/AC catalyst can be potentially used to remove SO 2 from industrial flue gases. References 1 Hartman M, Polek J R, Couglin R W. Chem Eng Symp Ser, 1971, 67: 7 2 Rubio B, Izquierdo M T.

Tel: +86-28-85403016 A series of Ni/AC catalyst samples were prepared by excessive impregnation, and the desulfurization activity of Ni/AC calcined at different temperatures was investigated. The Ni species on the Ni/AC catalyst calcined at different temperatures were studied by X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The characterization results showed that the Ni species on the catalyst calcined at 400 °C is Ni2O3. After calcination at 550 °C, NiO species is formed on the activated carbon. NiO and Ni coexist on the Ni/AC catalyst calcined at 800 °C, and only pure Ni species is observed after calcination at 1000 °C. This suggested that Ni can form different chemical states on the Ni/AC catalyst calcined at different temperatures. The desulfurization test results showed that the catalysts calcined at 550 and 800 °C exhibit good desulfurization activity, whereas the catalyst calcined at 400 °C has poor activity, indicating that different chemical states of Ni on the Ni/AC catalyst show different desulfurization performance, and NiO is the main active phase of the Ni/AC catalyst. 摘要 采用过量浸渍法制备了䜕Ni/AC䜕催化剂,䜕考察了不同焙烧温度对䜕Ni/AC䜕脱硫活性的影响,䜕并通过䜕X䜕射线衍射和䜕X䜕射线光电子能谱对催化剂进行了表征,䜕研究了经不同温度焙烧后的催化剂上的䜕Ni䜕物种形态及其对催化剂性能的影响.䜕䜕结果表明,䜕经䜕400䜕䜕焙烧后的催化剂中䜕Ni䜕物种为䜕Ni2O3,䜕550䜕C䜕焙烧后出现了䜕NiO䜕物种,䜕800䜕°C䜕焙烧后䜕Ni䜕物种变为䜕NiO䜕和䜕Ni䜕共存,䜕而䜕1 000䜕°C䜕焙烧后只存在单质䜕Ni.䜕䜕这说明不同温度焙烧后的催化剂中䜕Ni䜕形成了不同的化学形态.䜕䜕脱硫活性的测试结果表明,䜕经䜕550䜕°C䜕和䜕800䜕°C䜕焙烧后的催化剂表现出较好的脱硫活性,䜕而䜕400䜕°C䜕焙烧的催化剂脱硫活性最差.䜕䜕这说明䜕Ni䜕在催化剂上的不同化学形态是造成脱硫效果差异的主要原因,䜕而䜕NiO䜕是䜕Ni/AC䜕催化剂脱硫的主要活性物相.
