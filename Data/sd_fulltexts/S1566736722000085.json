A transparent catalytic counter electrode (CE) with excellent properties plays an important role in the performance improvement of bifacial dye-sensitized solar cells (Bi-DSSCs). In this work, pyrrole is combined with molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) by a refluxing technology and subsequently polymerized in situ to construct polypyrrole (PPy)-MoS2 CEs with high transparency. And compared with the original PPy CE, the PPy-MoS2 CE shows higher electrocatalytic activity for triiodide reduction. A superior power conversion efficiency of 9.48% under both-side irradiation is obtained for the Bi-DSSCs assembled with PPy-4 wt‰ MoS2 complex CE, compared to 7.36% bifacial efficiency for PPy-CE based solar cell. Graphical abstract Unlabelled Image Keywords Bifacial dye-sensitized solar cells Transparent catalytic electrode Polypyrrole‑molybdenum sulfide complex Electrocatalytic activity 1 Introduction Bifacial dye-sensitized solar cells (Bi-DSSCs) have been firstly proposed by Ito et al. in 2008 [1] and attracted much attentions recently due to their irradiation of sunlight from both sides, which greatly increases the utilization ratio of solar energy and the simplicity of solar cells installation [2,3]. Moreover, the two-sided transparency enables Bi-DSSCs to become a portable battery and be applied in the building integrated photovoltaic system, in which Bi-DSSCs should integrate with transparent substrates such as skylight, building window, panel screen and lampshade [4]. Accordingly, it is very important to design and fabricate transparent catalytic counter electrodes (CEs) with high electrocatalytic activity for Bi-DSSCs. Platinum (Pt) is typically used as CEs because of its high catalytic activity and electrical conductivity, therefore transparent thin-layer Pt CEs for Bi-DSSCs have been prepared by thermal deposition or sputtering [5]. However, Pt suffers from the high reflectance which makes it not an ideal transparent CE in Bi-DSSCs. Furthermore, the high cost and limited reserves of Pt also hinder the large-scale industrial application of DSSCs. Accordingly, many transparent and cost-effective CEs have been studied to replace the traditional Pt for low-cost Bi-DSSCs, such as carbon-based materials [6–9] and conductive polymer [10–14]. Carbon-based materials including graphite [7], carbon black [8] and carbon nanotubes [9] have been widely studied, nevertheless, the electrocatalytic activity toward I3 − reduction of carbons mainly depends on oxygenated functional groups and defects which impede the transport of electron, and a certain thickness is required for carbon CEs to achieve considerable catalytic activity, which would lead to a low optical transmissibility and therefore poor photoelectric conversion performance. Meanwhile, conductive polymers including poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) [10], polyaniline [11] and polypyrrole (PPy) [12–14] have also been employed as transparent CEs for Bi-DSSCs. Among these conductive polymers, due to easy synthesis, high catalytic activity and stability as well as high transparency, PPy has been considered to be one of the most promising transparent CE materials [12]. Recently, Bu et al. [12] employed a transparent PPy CE for Bi-DSSCs, yielding 8.8% total power conversion efficiency of the sum of front-and rear-conversion efficiencies. Sangiorgi et al. [13] prepared transparent PPy CE by electrochemical process with doping anions and achieved a maximal front and rear efficiency of 2.4% and 0.9%, respectively. In order to further improve the electron transfer and catalytic activity of PPy transparent catalytic electrode, Li et al. [14] synthesized honeycomb PPy/multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composite films and obtained 7.07%-front and 4.11%-back efficiency for Bi-DSSCs. However, carbonaceous materials such as MWCNT have a disadvantage of finite reaction sites for electrolyte reduction and thus unsatisfactory catalytic activity. It is well known that molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) has high transparency and large specific surface area to fully contact the electrolyte to provide a large number of I3 − reduction active sites and favor electron transfer, showing a catalytic activity comparable to that of Pt materials [15]. In the search for a more powerful PPy-based transparent CEs compound, here we creatively demonstrate that pyrrole monomers can be used for functionalizing and solubilizing MoS2 by constructing donor-acceptor compounds during the reflux process. Due to covalent linkages between pyrrole (N atoms) and MoS2 (Mo atoms) in the resulting pyrrole-MoS2 compound, PPy can be controllable grown onto the surfaces of MoS2 to fabricate highly transparent PPy-MoS2 complex CEs, which is applied in Bi-DSSCs under front or rear side sunlight irradiation (shown in Fig. S1a). By metal (dπ)‑nitrogen (pπ) antibonding, PPy can grow along the surface of MoS2 to form conductive matrix, which is beneficial to not only promote the electron transfer along PPy chain and between MoS2 nanoparticles, but also hinder the accumulation of PPy and MoS2 nanoparticles to provide more I3 − reduction active sites. Thanks to the higher electrocatalytic activity and transparent of PPy-MoS2 composite than those of pure PPy, an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.48% is obtained for Bi-DSSCs employing PPy-4 wt‰ MoS2 complex CE when adding a mirror as a sunlight reflector for two-sided lighting (shown in Fig. S1b), which is higher than the efficiency of DSSCs shined from only front or rear side and 7.36% of Bi-DSSCs assembled with PPy CE irradiated from both sides. In this work, the facile synthesis of novel PPy-MoS2 complex by a reflux technique is carried out with the purpose of using it as an effective and transparent CE for Bi-DSSCs. As we know, the use of this type of CE material in DSSCs is reported for the first time. The PPy-MoS2 complex CEs' structure, morphology, and electrochemical performances are characterized in detail. Effect of MoS2 doping percentage in the PPy-MoS2 complex on the performance of Bi-DSSCs is also investigated. The complexation of MoS2 and PPy enhances active sites and therefore electrocatalytic activity and also improves charge transport as well as transparency of the CEs. Moreover, the transparent PPy-MoS2 composite catalytic electrode with superior electrochemical activity can also be widely used in other electrochemical systems, such as supercapacitors [16], photoacoustic devices [17] and sensors [18], responding to the growing requirement for transparent equipments. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Structural characterizations To explore the complexing mechanism of pyrrole monomers and MoS2, the ultraviolet-visible (UV–vis) adsorption spectra were measured. From Fig. 1a, it can be found that the pyrrole and pyrrole-MoS2 mixture have a single peak around 285 nm, which is assigned to the π—π* transition of the pyrrole rings. For pyrrole-MoS2 complexes, a new absorption peak appears at about 340 nm, implying the successful complexation of pyrrole and MoS2 [19,20]. Pyrrole and MoS2 can form fast charge transfer complexes in their ground state at boiling temperature of pyrrole monomer since pyrrole and MoS2 are good electron donors and electron acceptors, respectively [21]. The fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) spectra of PPy and PPy-MoS2 complexes with different MoS2 dosages were measured to further detect. the chemical compositions, as Fig. 1b displays. The whole characteristic peaks related to PPy are observed in the spectra for all samples, and the peak intensities of PPy-MoS2 complexes are slightly decreased compared with those of pure PPy attributing to a little smaller amount of PPy in the PPy-MoS2 complexes than in the equal-mass pure PPy when testing FTIR. The two peaks at 1543 and 1459 cm−1 correspond to CC stretching of pyrrole ring and C − N stretching, respectively. The peaks at 1309 and 1177 cm−1 are attributed to the CH in plane vibrations. The minor peak at 1093 cm−1 is associated with NH in plane deformation. Moreover, the peaks observed at 1043, 915 and 794 cm−1 are assigned to the CH out-of-plane deformation vibrations of the pyrrole ring. All peaks for PPy-MoS2 complexes display a slight red shift in comparison with those of pure PPy, which is likely induced by the partial π-electron transferring from PPy to MoS2 arising from the interaction between the host monolayers and guest polymers and corroborates the successful polymerization of PPy onto MoS2 surfaces [22]. The above results show that there is a synergistic effect between PPy and MoS2 to enhance the electron delocalization degree and conductivity of PPy in the composites, which is conducive to promote charge transfer and therefor the electrocatalytic activity of PPy-MoS2 complexes. The synergistic effect and complexation mechanism between PPy and MoS2 are illustrated in Fig. 1c. Firstly, pyrrole monomer and MoS2 can form donor-acceptor complexes during reflux as evidenced by Fig. 1a because of a covalent interaction between N atoms in pyrrole and Mo atoms in MoS2, causing that pyrrole can be controlled to polymerize on the surface of MoS2 to obtain a high transparent PPy-MoS2 complex electrode. Previous studies have indicated that in traditional in-situ polymerization, due to strong intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds, PPy macromolecular chains are intertwined to form agglomerated nanoparticles to results in low active sites, electron delocalization as well as short-range charge transfer, and therefore inferior electrochemical properties. In the polymerization of pyrrole-MoS2 complex, the growth of PPy along MoS2 surface helps to prevent the accumulation of PPy chains and MoS2 nanoparticles to provide more active sites for the reduction of I3 −. Moreover, PPy and MoS2 can form a conductive matrix by the metal (dπ)‑nitrogen (pπ) antibonding interaction to increase the degree of electron delocalization and conductivity of PPy. Therefore, the complexation of PPy and MoS2 provides a significant synergistic effect for improving the electron transport and electrocatalytic activity. Fig. 2a and b shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of PPy and PPy-4 wt‰ MoS2 complex CEs. Strong intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds in PPy make itself display a compact aggregations structure with a smooth surface in Fig. 2a, which not only hinders the rapid penetration of I−/I3 − redox species, but also increases interfacial resistance for charger transport. While PPy-4 wt ‰ MoS2 complex shows a loose and porous structure without aggregation of MoS2 nanoparticles, which is conducive to increase the contact area with the electrolyte and therefore the electrocatalytic activity. As the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images shown in Fig. 2c and d, it can be seen more intuitively that PPy grows on the MoS2 matrix to form a loose structure, compared to the compact morphology of pure PPy. In addition, the uniform distribution of C, N, Mo and S elements for PPy-MoS2 complex shown in the energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) mapping images (Fig. 2e and f) further corroborates the homogeneous complexation of PPy and MoS2. The difference in morphology between PPy-MoS2 complex and PPy could be understood that MoS2 acts as the supporting materials and provides numerous sites for heterogonous nucleation and uniform growth of PPy, which prevents the accumulation of PPy and MoS2 to construct more reactive active sites, verifying again the mechanism presented in Fig. 1c. The transparency of CEs is a key factor affecting the backside incident light intensity and efficiency of Bi-DSSCs, hence the transparency of different CEs is studied, as shown in Fig. S2. Compared with pure PPy, all PPy-MoS2 CEs have higher optical transparencies and the transparency of 4 wt‰ MoS2 complex CE is the highest in wavelength range of 350–1100 nm, which is wider than the sensitized range of dye N719 at 450–620 nm. This result attribute to the fact that a small amount of MoS2 is conducive to increasing the orientation of PPy chains arranged along the surface of MoS2, while excessive MoS2 may provide low ratio of complexes along with disordered MoS2 aggregation, thereby reducing the transmittance of incident light. Accordingly, PPy-4 wt‰ MoS2 complex is a better candidate than pure PPy and other PPy-MoS2 complexes as CE for Bi-DSSCs. 2.2 Electrochemical properties As shown in Fig. 3a, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of various CEs are tested to investigate the electrocatalytic activity for I3 − reduction reaction. Compared with the traditional Pt and PPy CEs, the CV curves of PPy-MoS2 complex CEs show the similar shape and peak position, indicating that the electrocatalytic activity of PPy-MoS2 complex CEs is similar to that of Pt CE. The electrocatalytic activity of CEs can be judged by the peak current density of Red1 (J Red1) and the peak potential separation (E pp) of Red1 and Ox1 peaks. As the electrochemical parameters of different CEs shown in Table S1, the E pp of PPy-4 wt‰ MoS2 complex CE is the smallest. Lower E pp value represents less polarization, corresponding to higher exchange current densities and better reversibility (i.e., faster electron transfer kinetics) [23]. Moreover, a higher J Red1 of PPy-MoS2 complex CEs indicates a higher catalytic activity compared with PPy. Remarkably, the smallest E pp and largest J Red1 of the PPy complex CE containing 4 wt‰ MoS2 demonstrate its best electroreductive behavior. The fast charge-transfer between PPy and MoS2 as well as the enhanced catalytic active sites due to higher quantity of MoS2 attached on the PPy skeleton causes an increase in electrocatalytic activity. But higher doses of MoS2 may hinder charge transfer owing to the aggregations of MoS2, resulting in a poor catalytic activity. In order to confirm the above conclusions, the redox species' diffusion coefficient (D n) is calculated by the Randel-Sevcik theory [24]: J Red1 = Kn 1.5 ACD n 0.5 v 0.5, where K, n, A, v, and C are a constant of 2.69 × 105, the electron number of reduction reaction, the electrode area, the scan rate of recording CV curves and the concentration of iodide, respectively. The D n of PPy-only and PPy-8 wt‰ MoS2 complex CEs is 4.091 × 10−6 cm−2 s−1 and 4.626 × 10−6 cm−2 s−1, respectively, which are higher than the 2.55 × 10−6 cm−2 s−1 of Pt CEs reported in literature [25]. And the results indicate that the PPy complex electrode containing 4 wt‰ MoS2 displays the fastest diffusion kinetics for I3 −/I− redox species because of its elevated bonding sites between PPy and MoS2, resulting in faster charge-transfer within PPy-MoS2 complex CE and more active sites toward the reduction of I3 −. Furthermore, the stacking CV curves of PPy-4 wt‰ MoS2 CE tested at various scan speeds are shown inset of Fig. 3b. It can be observed that the peak current density of Ox1/Red1 redox shows a good linear relationship with the square root of scanning rate, which indicates that the redox reaction on CE surface conforms to the diffusion control mechanism to a great extent. It also implies that the Ox1/Red1 redox on the surface of PPy-4 wt‰ MoS2 complex CE has scarcely effects on the adsorption of I3 −/I− species, and there is no specific interaction between PPy-4 wt‰ MoS2 CE and I−/I3 − couples [26]. To appraise the stability of PPy-MoS2 CE in the application process, 80 cycles of CV curves using PPy-4 wt‰ MoS2 complex as working electrode for catalyzing I−/I3 − redox reaction were detected, as shown in Fig. 3c, and the peak current densities of I−/I3 − redox reaction are described in Fig. 3d. The inapparent attenuation of peak current density values for redox reaction, especially of J Red1, after 80 cycles indicates that the PPy-MoS2 complex electrode can continuously and stably reduce I3 − to I− in the application process of Bi-DSSCs. To understand the charge transfer kinetics at CEs and electrolyte interface, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were carried out with the symmetric structure of two same catalytic electrodes (CE/electrolyte/CE). Notably, a circular arc and tail are found for symmetric dummy cells from the Nyquist plots (Fig. 4a). The EIS spectrum was fitted by Zview software and the corresponding EIS parameters are summarized in Table S2, the fitted curves are very consistent with the. measure. Since only the relevant CEs are different in the EIS test, the series resistance (R s) can represent the conductivity of the corresponding CEs. It can be seen from Table S2 that PPy-MoS2 CEs have lower R s value, indicating a higher conductivity of the complex electrodes. The lowest charge-transfer resistance (R ct) value of the PPy-4 wt‰ MoS2 complex CE illustrates its highest electrocatalytic activity toward I3 − reduction. And the order of the Nernst diffusion impedance (W) value against MoS2 dosage is the same to that of R ct. For the complex CEs at 4 wt‰ MoS2 dosage, the increased number of bonding sites between PPy and MoS2 can accelerate the electron transfer within complex CEs and enhance the reduction rate of I3 −, which leads to the improvement of the electrocatalytic activity and the conductivity of PPy-4 wt‰ MoS2 CE. It is well known that the iodine ions reduced from triiodide will spontaneously diffuse to the photoanode and electrolyte interface for dye regeneration, thus the PPy-4 wt‰ MoS2 CE with improved electrocatalytic performance is conducive to decreasing the diffusion resistance of I−/I3 − redox species. The obtained results of electrocatalytic activity and diffusion behavior from EIS are in accordance with those of CV characterizations. The electrocatalytic activity of various CEs is further evaluated by the Bode EIS curves in Fig. 4b. The practical electron lifetime (τ) at CEs and electrolyte interface can be calculated from τ = 1/f p [27], where f p is the high frequency peak frequency corresponding to charge-transfer process. As summarized in Table S2, the complex CEs at 4 wt‰ MoS2 dosage shows the lowest τ 1 of 0.284 ms which is also smaller than 0.3136 ms of CoNi alloy CE reported in literature [28], followed by 1 wt‰ MoS2 dosage, 8 wt‰ MoS2 dosage and PPy. A decreased τ value implies that the electrons can quickly combine with I3 − and thereby increasing electrocatalytic activity of the complex CEs, agreeing well with the R ct analysis. The electrocatalytic activity of pure PPy and PPy-MoS2 complex CEs as well as the charge transfer performance at CEs and electrolyte interface can also be explored by Tafel polarization curves, as shown in Fig. 4c. According to the equation: J 0 = RT/nFR ct (where R, T, n and F are gas constant, absolute temperature, redox transfer electron number and Faraday's constant, respectively) [29], J 0 is inversely proportional to charge transfer resistance R ct. Notably, the J 0 follows the order of PPy-4 wt‰ MoS2 complelx > PPy-1 wt‰ MoS2 complex > PPy-8 wt‰ MoS2 complex > PPy, which is consistent with the sequence of R ct. Compared with pure PPy CE, the increased J 0 of PPy-MoS2 complex CEs is due to their fast charge-transfer and porous structure, which is evidenced by the above complexation mechanism and SEM images. Moreover, J lim is proportional to the diffusion coefficient (D n) according to equation: D n = lJ lim/2nFC [30], where l, n and C are the spacer thickness between the electrodes in a symmetric dummy cell, the number of electrons involved in the redox and the concentration of the I3 − ions, respectively. Obviously, both J lim and D n also follow the same sequence as J 0, indicating that the complexation of MoS2 and PPy improves the diffusion kinetics of I−/I3 − couple in electrolyte. The results of Tafel are consistent with those of CV and EIS measurements, cross-validating that the introduction of MoS2 in PPy catalytic electrode can effectively improve the electrocatalytic activity. 2.3 Photovoltaic performance Under different irradiation conditions (front-, rear- or both side), the typical photocurrent−voltage (J − V) curves of the DSSCs assembled with different CEs are detected and shown in Fig. 5 . Table S3 lists the detailed photovoltaic parameters. As shown in Fig. 5a, the DSSCs using pure PPy and PPy-MoS2 CEs have different J sc when coating the same amount of dye, revealing that the Red1 reaction is a limiting step in the photovoltaic process and the unabsorbed light passes directly through CEs [31]. The CEs can be graded as follows according to the reduction in the J sc: PPy-4 wt‰ MoS2 complex > PPy-1 wt‰ MoS2 complex > PPy-8 wt‰ MoS2 complex > PPy (see Table S3), which is consistent with the catalytic activity according to the J Red1 measured from the CVs. Owing to the high electrocatalytic activity and charge-transfer ability, the DSSC assembled with PPy-4 wt‰ MoS2 complex CE has a best front PCE of 7.80%, V oc of 0.707 V, J sc of 16.45 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.671 (Fig. 5a). The higher optical transmittance in visible region of CEs, the higher rear conversion efficiency. Therefore, a larger rear PCE of 3.13% is obtained for the DSSC employing PPy-4 wt‰ MoS2 complex CE in comparison with 1.50% for the DSSC based pure PPy CE, as shown in Fig. 5b. Compared with the complex CEs, pure PPy CE has a lower visible light transmittance and thus resulting in lower dye excitation and J sc. Furthermore, all the V oc values obtained by front-irradiation are larger than those by rear-irradiation. Actually, with the gradual attenuation of incident light intensity in TiO2 photoanode film, the electrons generated by dyes excitation are also decreasing. As a result, the recombination of electrons and triiodide species [I3 − + 2eCB − (TiO2) → 3I3 −] under rear-illumination is faster than that under front-light. The theoretical value of the V oc is determined by the redox potential of the electrolyte and the quasi-Fermi energy level of the TiO2, while the actual V oc is low compared to the theoretical value owing to an inverse reaction between the triiodide species and the photogenerated electrons [32]. Accordingly, the loss of electrons for front-illumination is low and therefore obtaining a high V oc. As shown in Fig. 5c, the DSSCs assembled with PPy-4 wt‰ MoS2 complex CE yields a maximum bifacial PCE of 9.48% (V oc of 0.725 V, J sc of 20.25 mA cm−2, FF of 0.646) under both-side irradiation owing to the best catalytic activity, charge transfer ability and optical transparency of this complex CE with 4 wt‰ MoS2 dosage, which is 21.54% higher than front-efficiency of 7.80%. The dark J-V curves of DSSCs assembled with different CEs were measured and showed in Fig. 5d. Typically, the recombination of electrons on the conduction band of TiO2 and triiodide species of electrolyte at their interface forms the dark current in DSSC. It can be found that the dark current of the DSSC assembled with PPy-4 wt‰ MoS2 complex CE is the smallest, demonstrating that the recombination of triiodide ions at TiO2/electrolyte interface is effectively inhibited, and the reduction rate of triiodide ions at the interface of complex CE and electrolyte is higher, which are mainly due to the lower R ct and higher electrocatalytic activity of PPy-4 wt‰ MoS2 complex CE. The electron migration lifetime on TiO2 photoanode can be calculated from Fig. 5e, as summarized in Table S2. It is obvious that the DSSC employing the complex PPy CE with 4 wt‰ MoS2 displays a longest electron lifetime (5.036 ms) than the other CEs based cells, which is attributed to the elevated electrocatalytic activity of PPy-4 wt‰ MoS2 complex CE as well as the reduced recombination at the interface of TiO2/electrolyte. To study the electrocatalytic stability of PPy-MoS2 CE under long-term illumination, the photocurrent as a function of illumination time of DSSCs assembled with different CEs was tested, as shown in Fig. 5f. After 3000 s illumination, the DSSC based on PPy-MoS2 CE still maintains 91.2% of the initial photocurrent density, while the PPy CE tailored cell only retains 83.0%, indicating that PPy-MoS2 complex has more stable electrocatalytic performance under long-term illumination due to the synergistic effect between PPy and MoS2. It is worth to note that the assembled Bi-DSSCs using the transparent PPy-MoS2 complex CE presents an optimal PCE of 9.48%, which is higher than the Bi-DSSCs employing polyaniline-MWCNT complex CE (9.24%) [33], 4-aminothiophenol/polyaniline CE (8.35%) [34], poly (vinyl pyrrolidone)/polyaniline nanocomposites CE (5.81%) [11] and polyaniline nanofibers CE (8.22%) [35]. In comparison with the front and rear efficiencies of DSSCs reported in literatures (as summarized in Table S4), a maximal PCE of 7.80% and 3.13% under irradiation from front and rear side, respectively, is obtained for the Bi-DSSC employing PPy-MoS2 complex CE. These findings show that the low cost PPy-MoS2 complex has excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability, which ensures its wide applications as an efficient CE candidate in Bi-DSSCs. 3 Conclusions In this work, the PPy-MoS2 complex synthesized by a reflux method is used as a transparent and low-cost catalytic electrode for Bi-DSSCs. Firstly, the metal (dπ)‑nitrogen (pπ) antibonding in the PPy-MoS2 complex facilitates an improvement in charge transfer and active sites to enhance the electrocatalytic activity toward electrolyte. Moreover, the optical transparency of PPy-MoS2 complex is evidently increased because of the oriented growth of PPy on MoS2 surface to fully meet the requirements of Bi-DSSCs. As a result, the Bi-DSSC assembled with PPy-MoS2 complex CE yields a cutting-edge bifacial, front and rear PCE of 9.48%, 7.80% and 3.13%, respectively, which are much higher than those of the cells assembled with pure PPy catalytic electrode. The excellent catalytic performance of PPy-MoS2 complex along with simple preparation and Pt-free material ensures its widespread application for Bi-DSSCs as a robust CE candidate.

        "dc:description": "A transparent catalytic counter electrode (CE) with excellent properties plays an important role in the performance improvement of bifacial dye-sensitized solar cells (Bi-DSSCs). In this work, pyrrole is combined with molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) by a refluxing technology and subsequently polymerized in situ to construct polypyrrole (PPy)-MoS2 CEs with high transparency. And compared with the original PPy CE, the PPy-MoS2 CE shows higher electrocatalytic activity for triiodide reduction. A superior power conversion efficiency of 9.48% under both-side irradiation is obtained for the Bi-DSSCs assembled with PPy-4 wt‰ MoS2 complex CE, compared to 7.36% bifacial efficiency for PPy-CE based solar cell.",
