Ru3(CO)~2 and RuC13 were compared as ruthenium precursors. The catalysts derived from Ru3(CO)12 exhibited an up to five times higher productivity than the corresponding ones derived from RuC13. Ruthenium metal dispersion, which probably influences the catalytic activity, was measured both by carbon monoxide and hydrogen chemisorption tests, and observed by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and was clearly higher in the case of the ruthenium cluster. Different ruthenium catalysts, with 2, 5, 8 and 10% metal and 30% potassium (added as KOH) on alumina, were prepared from Ru3(CO) 12. The highest hourly produc- tivity of ammonia, both referred to unit mass of the catalyst and to the ruthenium atom content, was obtained with 8% Ru/A1203-KOH at 623 K and atmospheric pressure.

Moggi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 145 159 enhanced activity, compared with the doubly promoted iron industrial catalyst Fe- AlzO3-K20 [ 2,3 ]. Metallic potassium added to alumina-supported ruthenium exerts a stronger promoting effect than potassium cation K+, added as KNO3 [4], as well as potassium oxide, probably due to the much lower ionization potential [5]. In view of the rate-determining step of ammonia synthesis over transition metals, consisting in the dissociative chemisorption of dinitrogen [ 6], the promotion effect is attributed to an electron donation from the alkali metal through the conducting support to ruthenium, which facilitates the dissociation of the nitrogen molecule by the formation of an anionic intermediate [3 ]. Once nitrogen is chemisorbed, it is quickly hydrogenated to ammonia in the presence of dihydrogen [7]. However, potassium metal could be lost during use, due to vaporization at reaction tempera- tures over 623 K; moreover, it is very susceptible to oxidation by traces of oxygen, carbon oxides and/or water possibly present in the synthesis gas [ 1 ]. On the other hand, potassium hydroxide was found to stabilize the Ru-AlzO3 catalyst against poisons such as water or carbon monoxide [8]. It is known that the ammonia formation rate on ruthenium based catalysts is strongly inhibited by hydrogen, which is concurrently adsorbed on the ruthenium surface [9]. Thus, although promoted ruthenium catalysts are more active than iron catalysts at atmospheric pressure, the activity of the former would be exceeded by that of the latter at high pressure [ 10]. Indeed, the Ru-AC-K catalyst is more active than the Fe-A1203-K20 catalyst at around 573 K and atmospheric pressure, but the rate of ammonia for- mation levels off above 30 atm at 623 K [ 1 ]. Therefore, it would seem to be very useful to try for even more active ruthenium-based catalysts in order to obtain industrially important ammonia yields at increasingly lower temperatures to reduce pressure again and so to minimize the inhibitory effect of hydrogen. Furthermore, the observation by Naito and Tamaru [ 11 ] that the rate of ammonia formation in the reaction of CH4, H20 and N2, over a silica-supported ruthenium cluster catalyst was faster than that over the catalyst prepared from RuC13 appears to be very promising. Moreover, it is well known that Ru-AI203 prepared from Ru3(CO)12 resulted in more active catalysts than Ru-A1203 prepared from RuCI3 in other reactions, such as carbon monoxide hydrogenation to alkenes [12] or carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide methanation [13]. In a more recent paper [14] concerning the promoter effect of alkali metal oxides on active carbon-supported ruthenium catalysts for ammonia synthesis, it was found that RuC13\" 3H20 and Ru ( NH3 ) 6C13 as precursors gave better results than Ru~ (CO) ~2, probably because Ru3 (CO)I2 does not react with the carbon surface, giving after decomposition less ruthenium dispersion and less activity. However, that would not be the case on alumina as support, because there is much spectroscopic evidence of an interaction between Ru3 (CO)~ and the hydrated surface of alumina [ 15-18]. The aim of this work was to compare the activity of ruthenium catalysts, supported on KOH- pretreated alumina, prepared from RuC13.3H~O and Ru3(CO)12 precursors, and also to study the ammonia synthesis reaction over a Ru-A1203-KOH catalyst over P. Moggi et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 145-159 147 a wide range of experimental conditions, as partially reported in a preceding letter [19]. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation of catalysts A microspheroidal high purity alumina (Snamprogetti), ground to 40-80 mesh, thermally pretreated in air at 423 K for 2 h, then at 773 K overnight, was used as support. Alumina was impregnated with KOH (Carlo Erba RP, min. 85%) from an alcoholic solution by wetting at room temperature for 2 h in a rotating flask, followed by evaporating to dryness in vacuo at 343 K, then heating in air at 773 K overnight. Ruthenium supported catalysts were prepared from Ru3 (CO) 12 and from RuCI> Alumina modified with KOH (about 30 wt.-% as potassium) was impreg- nated with hexane solutions of dodecacarbonyl triruthenium (Aldrich Chemie, 99%) or with aqueous solutions of hydrated ruthenium trichloride (5-10% water, Fluka), by evaporating to dryness in vacuo in a rotating flask. Then, the obtained solid materials were dried in a nitrogen stream at 323 K for 4 h in an evacuated oven. An amount of 1-2 g of ruthenium supported compound was then charged in a tubular microreactor ( 10 mm I.D.) and gradually heated (about 2 K min 1) to 673 K in flowing hydrogen ( 25-30 ml rain- 1, at standard temperature and pressure, STP) and then maintained at the above temperature for at least 3 h. The catalysts prepared from Ru3(CO) 12 were also preactivated by heating to 673 K in flowing helium, finally followed by the reduction treatment with hydrogen at 673 K for 3 h. 2.2. Characterization of the catalysts Unpromoted alumina and modified alumina with about 10-20-30 wt.-% potas- sium (added as KOH) were characterized by surface area determination, ammonia chemisorption and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), X-ray powder dif- fraction (XRD) spectra and Fourier-transformed infrared (FT-IR) spectra. The specific surface areas were determined by a Micromeritics model 2200 analyzer (Micromeritics Instrument Co.), from nitrogen adsorption at the temper- ature of liquid nitrogen, after degassing the samples in a nitrogen stream at 573 K for about 1 h. The ammonia chemisorption and thermal desorption were used to investigate the surface acidity of alumina before and after the impregnation with KOH and the ammonia retention by the modified support at the reaction temperature. An amount of 0.6-0.8 g of solid support, ground to 40-80 mesh, were charged into a pulse microreactor (6 mm I.D. ) placed in an electric oven and connected to a gas chromatograph (DANI mod. 3400, TCD) equipped with a packed column of 148 P. Moggi et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 145-159 5% KOH+20% Carbowax 1500 on Chromosorb W-AW 80-100 mesh (5 m 5 mm I.D.). Gas chromatography (GC) analyses were performed isothermally at 333 K, using helium as a carrier gas with a flow-rate of 3000 ml h J. The solid support was thermally pretreated at 773 K under helium flow for at least 4 h, then the chemisorption tests were performed at 373 K or 623 K, by injecting successive pulses of 1 ml anhydrous ammonia (Union Carbide, specialty gas) until saturation as revealed by a nearly constant ammonia peak area on the chromatogram. The total amount of ammonia adsorbed (Vad~, ml) was calculated by means of the following equation: Vaa~ = S(A~t- A,)/A~, i where As,t is the mean value of the chromatographic peak areas, measured in arbitrary units by a Hewlett-Packard model 3390 integrator, at saturation, and Ai is the chromatographic peak area measured for each pulse before the saturation was attained. In order to have an estimation of the surface acidity, the total amount of ammonia adsorbed at 373 K was then expressed as mmol NH3 per gram of alumina, while to estimate the ammonia retention at the reaction temperature the total amount of ammonia adsorbed at 623 K was then expressed as mmol NH3 per gram of solid support (A1203 + KOH). The TPD curves of preadsorbed ammonia were registered by the gas chromato- graphic peak area integrator as the solid support was heated in the pulse microreactor from 373 to 773 K at about 3 K min- '. XRD spectra of unpromoted and modified alumina powders were recorded on a Philips PW 1050 spectrometer using the Cu Ko~ radiation. FT-IR spectra after saturation with gaseous ammonia at room temperature and at 623 K were recorded by using a Nicolet 5 PC spectrophotometer. 2.3. Catalytic activiO, tests Ammonia synthesis was generally performed between 523 and 723 K, at atmos- pheric pressure by feeding 40 or 120 ml min-~ of a Hz-N2 (3:1) synthesis gas mixture through a fixed bed of 1-2 g of ruthenium based catalyst charged into a stainless-steel flow microreactor (10 mm I.D.). The gaseous effluents from the reactor bubbled into a 0.1 M solution of hydrogen chloride. The amount of absorbed ammonia was then determined by titrating the excess of hydrogen chloride with a standard 0.1 M solution of sodium hydroxide, using phenolphthalein as indicator. Ammonia productivity was then calculated as the mean value from a 4 h test as mg of ammonia produced per g of ruthenium in the catalyst and per hour. In another set of tests the ammonia concentration in the effluent gases and the dihydrogen conversion during reaction were measured by periodically injecting the effluent gases from the flow microreactor onto a gas-chromatographic column (5% KOH + 20% Carbowax 1500 on Chromosorb W-AW) through a 6-way sampling P. Moggi et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 145-159 149 valve equipped with a 12 ml volume sampling tube. In these tests the spatial velocity and the nitrogen-to-hydrogen molar ratio in the gaseous feed were also varied by diluting the synthesis gas (N2 + 3H2) stream with excess nitrogen. 2.4. Chemisorption tests After the decarbonylation and the reduction treatments in a pulse microreactor up to 673 K with helium and/or dihydrogen, the catalysts were cooled to 423 K in helium flow, then the amounts of adsorbed carbon monoxide and dihydrogen were measured by the gas chromatographic pulse method as described above for the ammonia adsorption tests. Successive 0.5 ml pulses of carbon monoxide, or hydro- gen, at 1 min intervals up to saturation were injected by a gas-tight syringe and diluted in the carrier gas flow through the catalytic bed maintained at 423 K. The gas-chromatographic device was equipped with a packed column, which gave very low retention times for the gas analyzed in order to keep the gas desorption during the test negligible. The temperature of 423 K was selected to. guarantee a quite fast rate of gas adsorption [ 20]. 2.5. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy observations The morphological characterization of the catalysts was carried out by means of high resolution electron microscopy (HRTEM) with a Jeol JEM 2000EX instru- ment equipped with a top entry stage. The samples for the HRTEM analyses were prepared by suspending the powders in isopropyl alcohol and then dispersing them on a copper grid coated with a holey carbon film. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Support characterization The specific surface areas and the ammonia adsorption values at 373 K for unpromoted and modified alumina, with 13, 29 and 43 wt.-% of KOH (9, 20 and 30 wt.-% as K, respectively), are reported in Table 1. It is clearly evident that the surface area decreases with increasing potassium hydroxide amount. The ammonia TPD profile of unmodified alumina is showed in Fig. 1. Adsorbed ammonia is almost entirely desorbed between 400 and 700 K, the temperature range corre- sponding to weak and intermediate acidity [21]. The addition of about 10 wt.-% of KOH is sufficient to neutralize it, so that the excess KOH can perform its promoter electronic effect on ruthenium [8]. Alumina modified with more than 20 wt.-% of KOH added adsorbs more ammonia at 623 K than at 373 K, probably because at this temperature free KOH interacts with ammonia or its decomposition products. Indeed, a sharp peak at 2170 cm- ~ appears in the FT-IR spectrum (Fig. 2) of the 150 P.

This spectrum was recorded at room temperature after saturation in the pulse microreactor with ammonia at 623 K followed by cooling in a helium stream. Very similar peaks were obtained after nitrogen treatment at 623 K of a 5% Ru-MgO-K sample and after ammonia treat- ment, even at 623 K, of a CaO sample without K [22]. They were assigned to adsorption on MgO of a product obtained from ammonia decomposition, or to nitrogen adsorbed on a CaO surface, respectively. In our case the peak at 2170 cm- 1 is clearly related to the presence of free KOH, because it was not formed at all after ammonia saturation at 623 K of unmodified alumina (lowest curve in Fig. 2). XRD patterns of unmodified and KOH-modified alumina powders baked up to 773 K are shown in Fig. 3. Peaks due to free KOH (2 0=32.2-32.4 clearly appeared in the XRD patterns of modified alumina with 29 wt.-% and 43 wt.-% of KOH; meanwhile, the intensity of the y-A1203 peaks (2 0=37.6 and 45.8 decreased strongly. 3.2. Comparison between ruthenium precursors.\" Ru3(C0)12 and RuC13 Fig. 4 shows the ammonia production rates over 2 wt.-% Ru/A1203-KOH (30 wt.-% as K) catalysts, prepared from Ru3(CO)~2 and RuC13, respectively, as a function of reaction temperature. The ammonia production rate over Ru/A1203- KOH catalyst, prepared from Ru3(CO)12, increases by increasing the reaction temperature up to 663 K, then decreases at higher temperatures. This was probably because the equilibrium conversion had been reached, which was only approached at 723 K over the RuC13-derived catalyst at the same reaction temperature. Most comparison tests were performed over ruthenium based catalysts containing 5 wt.-% of supported ruthenium. In Fig. 5 the dihydrogen conversions are reported P.

The finely dispersed carbon between adjacent ruthenium particles may prevent their agglom- eration even at higher temperatures, resulting in a stable higher dispersion and a higher catalytic activity. The higher activity of a ruthenium based catalyst prepared from Ru3(CO)t2, compared to RuC13 as precursor, is clearly evidenced from the ammonia productiv- ity curves reported as a function of the specific volumetric flow-rate of the synthesis gas (N2 + 3 H2) in Fig. 7. Ammonia productivity on a RuC13-derived catalyst levels off at about 0.4 g h - ~ per gram of ruthenium when the volumetric flow-rate exceeds 9 NI h- 1 per gram of catalyst, while on cluster-derived catalysts ammonia produc- tivity increases almost linearly at increasing flow-rates. The lack of residual chloride ion and the higher metal dispersion after decomposition on a suitable support, such as alumina, from a ruthenium cluster compound are commonly invoked [ 12,13 ] to justify the higher activity of the Ru/ A1203 system derived from Ru3(CO) 12. In the case of a KOH-modified alumina as support, the free KOH, even present after air calcination at 773 K, as evidenced by X-ray powder diffraction spectra ( see Fig. 3), should be able to neutralize residual chloride ion; then the much lower activity of the RuC13-derived catalyst, comparing to the Ru3 (CO) 12-derived one, is more easily attributable to the much lower metal dispersion. This conclusion is firmly strengthened by the carbon monoxide and hydrogen chemisorption data summarized in Table 2, which also allow a useful comparison between the different ways followed for the activation of the P.

[ 12]. Ru3(CO)~2-derived catalysts. The amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrogen chemisorbed on the Ru3(CO)j2-derived catalysts were significantly higher than those on the RuC13-derived catalysts. The activation of Ru3(CO)~2/AI203-KOH performed up to 673 K under helium flow gave lower amounts of chemisorbed carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the adsorption tests, probably due to the incom- plete decarbonylation of the precursor cluster and reduction of ruthenium to metal, without damaging, however, the catalytic activity development. The activation procedure based on decarbonylation up to 673 K under flowing helium followed by hydrogen treatment at 673 K gave the highest chemisorbed amounts of carbon monoxide and, moreover, of hydrogen, indicating a higher metal dispersion, accord- ing to the higher catalytic activity. The agreement between our chemisorption results and the literature data reported in Table 2 are noteworthy, though the latter were obtained on KOH-free samples. A similar agreement was observed between the dimensions of the supported ruthenium metal particles. After the catalytic tests, two ruthenium catalysts, with 2 wt.-% Ru, prepared from Ru3(CO)12 and RuC13, respectively, were subjected to HRTEM investigations, in order to ascertain if their markedly different catalytic activities could be related to morphological differences in metal particle size and distribution. As shown in Fig. 8A, the catalyst derived from Ru3(CO) 12 exhibits a very uniform particle distribution over the inorganic matrix. Furthermore, all particles examined show nearly the same spheroidal shape and size, having a mean diameter, averaged over fifty aggregates, of 2 nm. Quite different is the appearance of the catalyst derived from RuCI3 (Fig. 8B), which shows a non-uniform particle distribution. In addition, particle sizes are spread over a wider range of values; metal aggregates larger than 10 nm were observed. A further confirmation of the advantage of using Ru3(CO) J2, rather than RuC13, as ruthenium precursor, can be evidenced by the comparison illustrated in Fig. 9 156 P.

These were then tested for ammonia synthesis in the temperature range from 573 to 723 K, by feeding 2400 ml h-~ of a N2-H2 mixture with a 1:3 nitrogen-to-hydrogen molar ratio at atmospheric pressure. In Fig. 10 the ammonia productivity values, expressed as mg of ammonia per gram of catalyst and per hour, are reported as a function of the reaction temperature. By increasing the ruthenium loading, the equilibrium con- version is attained at lower reaction temperatures. In Fig. 11 the ammonia produc- tivity values for the same run of tests are reported, expressed as mg of ammonia hourly produced per gram of supported metal ruthenium. The obtained patterns show that before the attainment of the equilibrium conversion the specific activity of the catalysts is clearly increasing up to 8 wt.-% ruthenium loading, which probably corresponds to a complete coverage of the support surface with metal particles. The reaction tests performed at 623 K were then selected for a final comparison, which is illustrated in Fig. 12; the highest ammonia productivity values, both referring to unit mass of the catalyst or of the supported metal, are obtained with 8 wt.-% ruthenium loading. 4. Conclusions By using Ru3(CO) 12 rather than RuC13 as precursor for alkali promoted ruthe- nium supported on alumina, the catalytic activity for the ammonia synthesis at atmospheric pressure was effectively improved. The adsorption of the Ru3(CO)12 cluster on the surface of a reactive support such as alumina is able to give, after decomposition and reduction to metal, a very high dispersion of the metal particles, anchored to the active sites of the support in a regular array. This can facilitate the electron transfer from the alkali promoter to P. Moggi et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 145 159 159 the metal sites and can also prevent the deactivation effect due to the aggregation of metal islands at elevated reaction temperature. Consequently, decomposition in an inert flow and reduction of Ru3(CO)12 on alkali-promoted alumina provides a very active and long-life catalyst for ammonia synthesis at atmospheric pressure.

Ru3(CO)12 and RuCl3 were compared as ruthenium precursors. The catalysts derived from Ru3(CO)12 exhibited an up to five times higher productivity than the corresponding ones derived from RuCl3. Ruthenium metal dispersion, which probably influences the catalytic activity, was measured both by carbon monoxide and hydrogen chemisorption tests, and observed by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and was clearly higher in the case of the ruthenium cluster. Different ruthenium catalysts, with 2, 5, 8 and 10% metal and 30% potassium (added as KOH) on alumina, were prepared from Ru3(CO)12. The highest hourly productivity of ammonia, both referred to unit mass of the catalyst and to the ruthenium atom content, was obtained with 8% Ru/Al2O3 KOH at 623 K and atmospheric pressure.
