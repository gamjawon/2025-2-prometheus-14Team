Desorption behavior of gases from the NH3-preadsorbed catalyst and sensing materials used for double-layer semiconductor NH3 sensors has been investigated under different adsorption and desorption conditions. The 0.5 Ir/TiO2 catalyst material was found to exhibit mild activity for NH3 oxidation and high activity for reducing NO to N2 in an atmosphere containing NH3 and O2. This nature was considered to be effective for reducing the interference from NO x at the vicinity of the interface between the catalyst layer and the In2O3 sensing layer doped with 5 mol% MgO. The reduction of the interference led to high NH3 sensitivity and a normal response to give a resistance decrease upon exposure to NH3 even at higher temperatures. The abnormal response of a double-layer sensor with a 0.5 Pt/TiO2 catalyst layer to give a resistance increase upon exposure to NH3 especially at higher temperatures was confirmed to arise from its high NH3 oxidation activity and low NO reduction activity. Keywords Adsorption Desorption Double-layer sensor Ammonia-gas sensing 1 Introduction Ammonia-gas sensing has become increasingly important in controlling systems for various industrial processes and human comfort. Numerous efforts have been directed to developing highly sensitive NH3 sensors by employing organic membranes, solid electrolytes and semiconductive metal oxides. Among them, most of the semiconductor gas sensors [1–5] reported so far exhibit very small changes in resistance (or conductance) upon exposure to NH3, i.e., very low NH3 sensitivity, except for an Au-loaded WO3 sensor [6,7]. Interference from NO x , especially NO2, which is an oxidation product of NH3 and is known to behave as an oxidizing gas [8,9], is presumed to be one of reasons for the low NH3 sensitivity observed. Actually, our previous study has shown that the interference from NO x is serious in detecting NH3 by semiconductor gas sensors [10]. A single-layer n-type In2O3 sensor doped with 5 mol% MgO {In2O3–MgO (5 mol%)} and equipped with a pair of electrodes in its innermost region (Fig. 1a and b) exhibited a resistance decrease, i.e., a normal response, upon exposure to 300 ppm NH3 at a temperature as low as 300°C. However, an abnormal response was observed above 500°C, an abrupt decrease in resistance, followed by a gradual increase to a higher level than that in air, upon exposure to NH3. Furthermore, an additional increase and a subsequent decrease in resistance were observed after removal of NH3. Such an abnormal response was further highlighted when the In2O3–MgO (5 mol%) sensor was covered with a TiO2 loaded with 0.5 wt.% Pt (0.5 Pt/TiO2) catalyst layer (Fig. 1c). The resistance of this double-layer sensor remained almost constant upon exposure to NH3 at 370°C, but increased after removal of NH3. At 620°C, the resistance increased abruptly upon exposure to NH3, and further increased even after removal of NH3. Such abnormal response behavior is undoubtedly due to interference from NO x . In contrast, we found that a double-layer sensor fabricated by coating an In2O3–MgO (5 mol%) sensing layer with a 0.5 Ir/TiO2 catalyst layer kept its normal response up to 620°C with relatively high NH3 sensitivity, although the resistance level just after removal of NH3 was slightly higher than the original air level. Furthermore, we succeeded to realize much higher NH3 sensitivity and complete recovery to the original resistance level after removal of NH3 even at 620°C by changing the electrode position from the innermost region of the sensing layer to the interface between the catalyst layer and the sensing layer (Fig. 1d). These results suggest that the control of oxidation behavior of NH3 over the catalyst and sensing materials is important in developing highly sensitive NH3 sensors. In order to discuss the NH3 sensing mechanism of the double-layer sensors and then to establish the guidelines on the design of semiconductor NH3 sensors, the surface chemistry of NH3 over the catalyst and sensing materials has been investigated by temperature programmed desorption technique (TPD) in the present study. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of specimens Titanium oxide was prepared by calcining the hydrolysis product of titanium tetrachloride at 1000°C for 1 h in air. The oxide was suspended in an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6·6H2O, PdCl2, or IrCl3·H2O, followed by evaporation to dryness [11,12]. The amount of the metal loaded was fixed at 0.5 wt.% in every case. The resultant solid was ground, and was subjected to reduction in flowing H2 at 400°C for 5 h. In2O3–MgO (5 mol%) as a sensing material was prepared in a dry process by mixing and grinding the constituent oxides, then calcining at 1100°C for 1 h in air. This process was repeated five times to ensure the solid solution of MgO into the In2O3 lattice [13]. 2.2 TPD measurement TPD spectra of gaseous species from the NH3-preadsorbed catalyst and sensing specimens were measured in a conventional flow apparatus under different adsorption and desorption conditions. The powder of the specimens was pressed into disks and then crushed to granules (40–60 mesh). The granules of each specimen (3.0 g) was set in the apparatus, and then were preheated at 700°C for 1 h under a flowing gas mixture of 20% O2 and 80% He at a rate of 30 cm3 min−1. In a cooling procedure the flowing gas was switched to another flowing gas, as indicated below, at 130°C. At the same temperature and in the same flowing gas, the granules were kept for 30 min for adsorption. Then the granules were cooled to room temperature in the same flowing gas. To remove physically adsorbed water, which may be produced by the oxidation of NH3 with oxygen adsorbates during the adsorption procedure, the granules were again heated at 120°C for 30 min under flowing pure He at a rate of 10 cm3 min−1. The granules were again cooled to room temperature under the same flowing. Thereafter, the TPD spectra were measured up to 700°C at a heating rate of 5°C min−1 in different flowing gases. The adsorption and desorption conditions were as follows: 1. Ads: 500 ppm NH3–0.2% O2–99.75% He; Des: 100% He 2. Ads: 500 ppm NH3–0.2% O2–99.75% He; Des: 300 ppm NH3–20% O2–79.97% He 3. Ads: 500 ppm NO–0.2% O2–99.75% He; Des: 100% He The No. 3 condition was conducted to confirm the surface reaction of NO with oxygen adsorbates over the specimens. The desorbed gases were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS, QP-5000, Shimadzu) every 3 min. The detection limits of NH3 and NO by GC-MS were about 400 and 200 ppm, respectively. However, GC-MS detection of a low NO2 concentration was difficult in the present study. Thus, the TPD peaks observed for these species correspond to concentrations higher than the limits. 3 Results 3.1 Desorption behavior of NH3 under flowing pure He Fig. 2 shows TPD spectra of gases desorbed from the NH3-preadsorbed 0.5 Ir/TiO2 measured under condition No. 1. The vertical axes represent the GC-MS intensities of the desorbed gases. Thus, the intensity does not directly mean the amount of a gas desorbed, but corresponds to a relative desorption rate of the gas. In addition, the intensity is plotted in an arbitrary unit, since quantitative analysis was not carried out for every gas in the present study. Therefore, the magnitude of the intensity cannot be compared among different gases, but can be a measure of the desorption rate for the same gas. Under experimental condition No. 1, maximum desorption peaks of NO, NH3, N2O, NO2 and N2 were observed around 273°, 305°, 320°, 320°, and 349°C, respectively. Although some amounts of NO, N2O and NO2 had already been produced during the NH3-preadsorption procedure, some amounts of these species may be produced by the reaction of the adsorbed NH3 with oxygen adsorbates during the desorption run to give some contribution to the TPD peaks. On the other hand, N2 is suggested to be produced by the reduction of NO with NH3 during the desorption run [14,15]. Thus, the N2 intensity can be regarded as a measure of the ability for reducing the interference from NO when the specimen is used as a catalyst layer in the double-layer NH3 sensors. Desorption behavior of each gas is compared among the specimens in Fig. 3 . For easy comparison of the data, the maximum scale of the vertical axis is kept constant for each gas throughout the present paper. The desorption of NH3 was observed with TiO2 and 0.5 Pd/TiO2 around 300°C as shown in Fig. 3a, but it was negligible in the cases of 0.5 Pt/TiO2 and In2O3–MgO (5 mol%). Among the specimens tested, 0.5 Ir/TiO2 exhibited the highest N2 desorption peak (Fig. 3b). Compared with the results obtained under different conditions shown in the below, the desorption peaks of N2O, NO and NO2 were small for every specimen under flowing pure He (Fig. 3c–e). 3.2 Desorption behavior of NH3 under a flowing gas mixture of NH3, O2 and He To get information on the desorption behavior of NH3 in the atmosphere of NH3 sensitivity measurement, TPD spectra were measured under a flowing gas mixture of 300 ppm NH3, 20% O2 and 79.97% He. The NH3 desorption peaks in Fig. 4a were obviously enlarged in comparison with those in Fig. 3a, except for that from 0.5 Pt/TiO2. Again, no NH3 desorption was observed from 0.5 Pt/TiO2. Additional adsorption of NH3 during the desorption run up to around 100°C is anticipated to be responsible for the enlargement. Besides 0.5 Ir/TiO2, only 0.5 Pt/TiO2 showed a clear N2 desorption peak around 163°C, but it was lower than that of 0.5 Ir/TiO2, as shown in Fig. 4b. Thus, it is shown that 0.5 Ir/TiO2 exhibits the highest activity for reducing NO to N2 among the specimens tested including the sensing material. Desorption peaks of N2O, NO and NO2 were also increased for every specimen under condition no. 2, due to both the increased amounts of adsorbed NH3 and the reaction of gaseous NH3, which was contained in the carrier gas, with oxygen adsorbates and/or gaseous O2. Especially, 0.5 Pt/TiO2 exhibited the maximum desorption peaks of N2O, NO and NO2 around 163°C, and their intensities were much larger than those observed with other specimens. These results imply the high catalytic activity of 0.5 Pt/TiO2 for the oxidation of NH3. Relatively large desorption peaks of NO and NO2 observed with most specimens above 400°C are considered to arise mainly from the reaction of gaseous NH3 with oxygen adsorbates and/or gaseous O2. 3.3 Desorption behavior of NO under flowing pure He To get information on the oxidation behavior of NO over the specimens and also on the desorption behavior of gases from NO-preadsorbed specimens, TPD spectra were measured under condition No. 3. A desorption peak of N2O was clearly observed around 274°C only with 0.5 Ir/TiO2, as shown in Fig. 5a . The specimen 0.5 Ir/TiO2 also exhibited a large desorption peak of NO around 226°C, but a small desorption peak of NO2, as shown in Fig. 5b and c, respectively. In contrast, 0.5 Pt/TiO2 exhibited the highest desorption peaks of NO and NO2 among the specimens tested. Furthermore, it is obvious that the desorption peak of NO2 shifted from 419°C to 306°C by the addition of 0.5 wt.% Pt to TiO2, as shown in Fig. 5c. These results confirm that the catalytic activity for the oxidation of NO is enhanced by the addition of Pt, and that 0.5 Pt/TiO2 exhibits the highest activity among the specimens tested. 4 Discussion Table 1 summarizes the sensing properties to 300 ppm NH3 in air of double-layer sensors consisting of a catalyst layer, an In2O3–MgO (5 mol%) sensing layer and interface electrodes, and the desorption data from the NH3-preadsorbed catalyst and sensing materials under condition No. 2. The sensing properties were cited from our previous study [10]. Here, the sensitivity is defined as the ratio of sensor resistance in air to that in 300 ppm NH3. For reference, the desorption behavior of gases from NH3-preadsorbed TiO2 is also listed in Table 1. The maximum sensitivity to 300 ppm NH3 of a thick film In2O3–MgO (5 mol%) sensor equipped with a pair of electrodes on the sensor surface was 1.3 at most, and was observed at 300°C. The coating of this sensor surface with a catalyst layer, i.e., fabrication of a double-layer sensor with interface electrodes, resulted in an increase in NH3 sensitivity. However, the magnitude of the sensitivity enhancement was markedly dependent on the kind of the catalyst layer. The most significant improvement was achieved with 0.5 Ir/TiO2 at 470°C. In addition, the resistance of the double-layer sensor with a 0.5 Ir/TiO2 catalyst layer recovered to the original air level after removal of NH3 over the whole temperature range of 340° to 620°C [10]. Although the coating with 0.5 Pt/TiO2 led to a slight increase in sensitivity at 340°C, the resistance of the double-layer sensor after removal of NH3 became higher than the original air level even at this temperature. This behavior became more significant at higher temperatures. Above 530°C the resistance in 300 ppm NH3 was higher than the original air level, and a further increase in resistance was observed just after removal of NH3. In the case of the double-layer sensor with a 0.5 Pd/TiO2 catalyst layer, such an abnormal response was not observed up to 620°C, whereas the sensitivity enhancement was less significant than that for the coating with 0.5 Ir/TiO2. Based on the present desorption behavior of gases from the NH3-preadsorbed materials, the reaction of NH3 in the double-layer sensors and their NH3 sensing mechanism are discussed below. The following reactions are likely to occur over the present catalyst and sensing materials. (1) 2NH 3 +4O − (ad)→N 2 O+3H 2 O+4e − (2) 2NH 3 +5O − (ad)→2NO+3H 2 O+5e − (3) NO+1/2O 2 →NO 2 (4) NO 2 +e − →NO 2 − (ad) (5) 2NH 3 +2NO+O − (ad)→2N 2 +3H 2 O+e − (6) 2NH 3 +2NO+3O − (ad)→2N 2 O+3H 2 O+3e − (7) 2NH 3 +N 2 O+2O − (ad)→2N 2 +3H 2 O+2e − Here, O−(ad) represents oxygen adsorbate, and reactions of NH3 with gaseous O2 are ruled out due to no direct electronic interaction with the sensing material. In the case of the double-layer sensor with interface electrodes employed in our previous study, it is of no doubt that chemical reactions in the vicinity of the interface between the catalyst and the sensing layer primarily regulate the electrical properties of the sensing layer. When 0.5 Ir/TiO2 is employed as a catalyst layer, most of NH3 is anticipated to diffuse into the interface through pores in the catalyst layer due to relatively low oxidation activity of the catalyst layer itself, as schematically shown in Fig. 6a . Then the resistance of the sensing material, n-type In2O3–MgO (5 mol%), decreases due to the reactions (1) and (2) at the interface. The N2O produced according to Eq. (1) is suggested to exhibit weak electronic interaction with the sensing material, and most of them go out of the sensor. In contrast, the NO produced according to Eq. (2) may directly affect the electronic properties of the sensing material by its chemisorption in the form of NO−(ad) or NO+(ad). Another possibility is that NO2 produced by the oxidation of NO with gaseous oxygen may chemisorb on the sensing material and then increase the sensor resistance according to Eqs. (3) and (4). However, the 0.5 Ir/TiO2 catalyst layer is considered to exhibit high activity for reducing NO to N2 under the presence of NH3 and O2 according to Eq. (5) or Eqs. (6) and (7). The progress of the reactions (2) and (5)–(7) results in a decrease in the sensor resistance, leading to high normal NH3 sensitivity of the double-layer sensor with the 0.5 Ir/TiO2 catalyst. Therefore, it is concluded that the high NH3 sensitivity and the normal response arise mainly from the high activity of 0.5 Ir/TiO2 for reducing NO to N2. On the other hand, most of NH3 is anticipated to be oxidized to N2O, NO and NO2 during the diffusion through the 0.5 Pt/TiO2 catalyst layer due to its high NH3 oxidation activity, as schematically shown in Fig. 6b. This is supported by the fact that no NH3 desorption peak is observed in the TPD spectrum, whereas large desorption peaks of N2O and NO are observed even at low temperatures, as summarized in Table 1. This is one of reasons for the lower NH3 sensitivity of the double-layer sensor with the 0.5 Pt/TiO2 catalyst layer than the sensor with the 0.5 Ir/TiO2 catalyst, because the steady-state NH3 concentration at the interface of the former becomes lower than that of the latter. Especially at temperatures higher than 350°C, the largest NO2 desorption peak was observed with 0.5 Pt/TiO2 among the specimens tested (Fig. 4e). Furthermore, 0.5 Pt/TiO2 is less active than 0.5 Ir/TiO2 for reducing NO to N2. Thus, the double-layer sensor with the 0.5 Pt/TiO2 catalyst layer is likely interfered from NO x , leading to an abnormal response to NH3 even at low temperatures. These results confirm that the abnormal response to NH3 arises from both the high activity for NH3 oxidation and the low activity for NO reduction of 0.5 Pt/TiO2. Due to the mild NH3 oxidation activity of 0.5 Pd/TiO2, in comparison with 0.5 Pt/TiO2, the double-layer sensor with the 0.5 Pd/TiO2 catalyst layer is anticipated to exhibit the intermediate NH3 sensing properties between the sensors with 0.5 Ir/TiO2 and 0.5 Pt/TiO2. Based on the above results, it may be argued that a thicker catalyst layer enhances the interference from NO x , even if its catalytic activity for NH3 oxidation is moderate. 5 Conclusion Comparison of the TPD spectra from the NH3-preadsorbed catalyst and sensing materials under a flowing gas mixture of NH3, O2 and He has revealed that the 0.5 Ir/TiO2 catalyst material exhibited the highest N2 desorption peak and therefore the highest activity for reducing NO to N2. In contrast, 0.5 Pt/TiO2 exhibited the largest desorption peaks of N2O, NO and NO2 around 163°C and a further large NO2 desorption peak above 370°C, showing its high activity for NH3 oxidation and low activity for NO reduction. Therefore, it is concluded that the high NH3 sensitivity of a double-layer sensor with a 0.5 Ir/TiO2 catalyst layer to give normal decreases in resistance, which was reported in our previous study, arises mainly from its high activity for reducing NO to N2, i.e., reducing interference from NO x to the sensor response. It is also confirmed that the complex response to NH3 of a double-layer sensor with a 0.5 Pt/TiO2 catalyst layer to give decreases or increases in resistance arises from both the high activity for NH3 oxidation and the low activity for NO reduction. To realize high NH3 sensitivity with semiconductor gas sensors, therefore, it is important to design the catalyst and sensing materials so as to exhibit moderate NH3 oxidation activity and high NO to N2 reduction activity. Furthermore, the sensor configuration such as electrode position and thickness of the catalyst and sensing layers is also important. References [1] P.J Shaver Appl. Phys.
