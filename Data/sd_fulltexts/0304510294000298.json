Osbaldiston, E.J. Markel* Department of Chemical Engineering, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208, USA (Received September 21, 1993; accepted February 4, 1994) Abstract Catalysts were synthesized using a displacement reaction of cobaltocene (Co (CSHS)2) with high surface area carbon to form a strongly bound metal surface complex and free cyclopentadiene. At loadings above 3 wt.%, the surface complexes polymerize to form metallocene sandwich polymers. Unlike pure unsupported cobaltocene, the supported metal complexes are stable up to 300 C in helium. X-ray diffraction analysis of the catalysts indicate the cobalt is highly dispersed with no cobaltcontaining crystalline phases present. Thiophene desulfurization measurements find a high selectivity for cis-2-butene and 1-butene. A mechanism for desulfurization by these catalysts is proposed in which 2,3-dihydrothiophene and 2,5-dihydrothiophene intermediates undergo rapid hydrogenolysis/ desulfurization reactions to form 1-butene and cis-2 butene, respectively. Selectivities for butane were below 2%, indicating the catalyst is a very poor hydrogenation catalyst. Keywords: Carbon; Cobaltocene; Desulphurization; Supported catalysts; Thiophene 1. Introduction Supported metal catalysts sinter at high temperatures, lowering metal dispersion and reducing catalyst effectiveness. In addition, dispersion is difficult to control using conventional liquid impregnation, calcination and reduction (activation) methods. This work examines a new route for the dispersion and immobilization of cobalt on a carbon support. A complex-support reaction will be used to bind cobalt directly to the surface of high surface area carbon via a covalent metal-carbon bond.

We have previously studied the reaction of cobaltocene with another allotrope of carbon (buckminsterfullerene) and observed rapid reaction to form an insoluble adduct containing buckminsterfullerene and cyclopentadienyl cobalt ligands (as determined by mass spectroscopy and IR [ 1 ] ) . Temperature-programmed desorption analyses of the material showed the cyclopentadienyl cobalt ligands were strongly bound to the complex, up to 350 C. Although it was not possible to produce the single crystals required to fully characterize the product, powder diffraction data indicated the unit cell of the polycrystalline solid was larger than the unit cell of buckminsterfullerene. Based on the available data, it was concluded that multiple-coordinated fullerene derivatives were formed (see Fig. 1) . This report extends the fullerene work using high surface area activated carbon as the substrate for cobaltocene reaction to produce a working heterogeneous catalyst (Fig. 1). Cobalt on carbon was chosen for this work because of interest in the role of cobalt in commercial alumina-supported cobalt molybdate catalysts for hydrodesulfurization. The structure of the active, sulfided phase of the commercial catalyst and the relative role of cobalt, molybdenum, sulfur and hydrogen is not completely understood. Topsoe and coworkers [ 2-1 ] have correlated the presence of a Co-Mo-S phase with catalytic activity. The Co-Mo-S phase is located at the edge planes of MOS2 crystallites [5-9].

Markel /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 91-106 93 and Co9S8 are less active. Yet, other recent work [ 10-18 ] has shown unusually high turnover numbers for thiophene desulfurization by cobalt supported on carbon, pointing to cobalt as an important component of the active phase of the working catalyst, even though it is present in relatively small amounts. At cobalt loadings above 1 wt. %, specific activities decline and Co9S$ is formed. The goal of this work is to disperse and bind cobalt to the surface of carbon to form a highly active catalyst which does not sinter to form inactive Co9S8. The thiophene hydrodesulfurization reaction was chosen for the testing of the carbon-immobilized cobalt catalysts. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation of catalysts Catalysts were synthesized from cobaltocene (Strem, 99%) and activated carbon (Atochem, GAC 250, 20/50 mesh, 980 m2/g) using solution impregnation/reaction methods to achieve loadings of 1, 3, 5, and 10 wt.% cobaltocene loadings. Typically, 500 mg of impregnated catalyst were prepared at a time. Air-sensitive cobaltocene was stored at -10 C in helium and carbon was stored in helium after being degassed at room temperature in a vacuum oven for 48 hours. To prepare each sample, the degassed carbon was first weighed. The mass of carbon was used to calculate the amount of cobaltocene required to achieve the desired loading. The cobaltocene was dissolved in degassed toluene in an inert atmosphere. The cobaltocene solution was added dropwise with a syringe. After filling the pores of the support with solution, flowing helium was introduced to evaporate the toluene. Multiple impregnations were required to achieve the higher loadings. In an alternative preparation, the support was immersed in a saturated toluene solution of cobaltocene for 24 h under nitrogen to allow adsorption/reaction to reach equilibrium. The solid product was removed and washed by immersion in a series of three toluene baths to remove any soluble reaction products or any unreacted cobaltocene. The washed material was dried using flowing helium and used immediately. 2.2. Temperature programmed decomposition/mass spectroscopy Catalyst samples were loaded into a 5 mm I.D. X 40 cm long quartz tube and heated in a laboratory furnace from 35 C to 982 C at 10 C/min in a helium stream (Matheson, 99.999%) flowing at 50 ml/h. The off-gas was carried by a heated stainless steel transfer line to a Finnigan model 400 ion trap detector. The mass spectrum was stored every 2 s and stored using an IBM PC /AT computer. An Omega Series 4000 CN201 1K temperature controller and a chrome//alumel thermocouple were used to program the furnace temperature. Catalysts loaded with 1, 3, 5, and 10 wt.% cobaltocene were tested. A sample mass of approximately 0.010 g was loaded into the quartz tube. Quartz frits or glass wool plugs were not used to hold the sample in place because the helium flow rate was slow enough not to entrain the particles. The quartz tube was joined to the stainless steel gas feed system and transfer line using a Swagelok connector and a nylon ferrule. 94 RJC. Osbaldiston, E.J. Markel /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 91-106 2.3. Scanning electron microscopy studies SEM micrographs were obtained using a Hitachi S-2500-Delta electron microscope equipped with an elemental analysis system. Samples were glued to aluminum stubs with graphite paste and loaded into the microscope under ambient conditions. Because the carbon support was conductive, gold sputtering was not required. 2.4. X-ray diffraction Diffraction patterns were obtained using a Rigaku D-max-B X-ray diffractometer equipped with a Cu source and a monochromator for the rejection of spurious lines. Samples were ground for analysis using an agate mortar and pestle and mounted on amorphous adhesive tape using a backless aluminum sample holder. The X-ray diffractometer's sample compartment did not permit an inert atmosphere to be maintained. Data was accumulated at a scan rate of 2 /min. 2.5. Thermogravimetric analysis A Perkin-Elmer TGA-7 thermogravimetric analyzer was used to monitor thermal decomposition of cobaltocene in nitrogen. A sample of 50 mg cobaltocene was quickly loaded to the sample pan and purged with nitrogen to avoid oxidative decomposition. Analysis was performed by heating from 35 C to 700 C at 20 C/min. Analyses of supported catalysts were not performed due to interference by adsorbed toluene. Adsorbed toluene remained on the surface of the catalyst samples because the measures required to remove the solvent (high temperatures, high vacuum) will disturb the surface species. 2.6. Thiophene desulfurization kinetic measurements Thiophene desulfurization rates were measured in a continuous flow, fixed bed reactor operating at approximately 1 bar. The reactor was constructed of 1 /8 in. I.D. quartz tubing and contained a bed of 0.100 g catalyst supported between pads of glass wool. A stream of 2.7% thiophene in hydrogen flowed at 0.5 ml/s over the bed of catalyst particles with a superficial space velocity of 10.5 s-'. Products were identified by GC/MS and quantified using gas chromatography. A Hewlett Packard 5890A gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and a 10 ft. X 0.125 in. O.D. picric acid column was used for separation of thiophene and the C4 hydrocarbon isomers. Data were stored and integrated using an IBM PC/AT computer using an A/D converter and software produced by Interactive Microware. Each experimental run commenced by heating the catalyst from room temperature to 400 C in the thiophene/hydrogen mixture at 0.125 C/s. After allowing a 20 min stabilization period at 400 C, the analytical system automatically sampled and analyzed the reaction products every 20 min for a 12 h period. Afterwards, the reactant mixture flow rate was increased from 0.5 ml/s to 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 ml/s to decrease residence time and approach differential conversion operation. Three analyses were obtained at each elevated flow rate for each catalyst. RJC. Osbaldiston, E.J. Markel /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 91-106 95 3. Results 3.1. Thiophene desulfurization kinetic studies Thiophene desulfurization activity was measured at 400 C over a 12-h period for catalysts with 1, 3, 5, and 10 wt.% cobaltocene loadings. Table 1 lists the fractional thiophene conversions observed at the end of the 12 h period for each catalyst. Catalyst deactivation during this period was found to average 20% (32% maximum deactivation) during the first four hours of reaction but declined little during the remaining eight hours. The carbon support alone exhibited a small but measurable activity (0.3% thiophene conversion at 400 C). Turnover rates were highest for the low loading catalysts and lower for the higher loading catalysts. The catalyst prepared by equilibrium adsorption produced the lowest turnover numbers. The principle products of thiophene desulfurization were identified by GC/MS as C4 hydrocarbons: butadiene, 1-butene, cis-2 butene, trans-2-butene and butane. Smaller amounts of CZ products were also observed. It is not clear if the CZ products are derived from the carbon support or from thiophene. Product analyses were used to calculate catalyst activities (defined as the fraction of thiophene converted to CQ products). Product selectivities at 400 C correlate well with the fractional conversion of thiophene for all reactions undertaken in this work, including reactions using different catalyst loadings and different space velocities (Fig. 2) . Fractional selectivities for butane, butadiene and butene are shown as well as the distribution of butene isomers (the molar ratio of the cis and trans isomers of 2-butene as well as the molar ratio of 1-butene and 2-butenes). Selectivities were observed to change slightly during the first four hours of reaction. These changes in selectivity were due to the changes in catalyst activity during early reaction. In all cases, the principle product ( > 80%) of desulfurization is butene. Smaller amounts of butadiene (5-18%) and even lesser quantities ( < 2%) of butane are observed. Substantial changes in selectivities are observed at low conversions: little butadiene or butane is observed at the lowest conversions. Interestingly, the dominant product expected at equilibrium is butane [ 16], but little is observed in these kinetic experiments. The observed product distributions are, therefore, due to reaction kinetics.

Thiophene desulfurization product selectivities from reactions utilizing all catalysts, each at a range of space velocities. The distribution of butene isomers at higher conversions is in agreement with equilibrium calculations: 2-butene predominates with a cisl trans ratio of 0.695. 1-Butene is observed at levels slightly higher than the 0.35 1-butene/2-butene ratio expected for an equilibrium distribution of isomers, but the 1-butene/2-butene ratio is sloping downward over this range of concentrations and extrapolation of this trend suggests equilibrium will be approached, given sufficient reaction time for equilibrium to be established. At differential conversions, 1-butene is the predominant product of thiophene desulfurization. Selectivity for cis-2-butene also increases. Extrapolation of selectivities to zero conversion indicates the direct product of thiophene desulfurization is 1-butene with lesser amounts of cis-2-butene formed and virtually no trans-2-butene, butane, or butadiene formed. Thus, the observation of butane, butadiene and trans-2-butene at higher conversions is not due to the kinetics of the thiophene desulfurization reaction but rather, the kinetics of the concurrent C4 hydrogenation/ dehydrogenation and isomerization reactions. A reference catalyst was prepared by liquid impregnation of cobalt nitrate to achieve a metal loading equivalent to the 10% cobaltocene catalyst. The catalyst was reduced and activated by sulfiding for two hours at 400 C using 10% HZS in hydrogen. Thiophene conversion at the end of a 12-h reaction period was 12.1%. The products of desulfurization consisted primarily of an equilibrium distribution of butene isomers, 11 % butane, and only traces ( < 1 %) of butadiene. The reference catalyst was more active for desulfurization and hydrogenation than the cobaltocene-derived catalysts. 3.2. Scanning electron microscopy Catalyst particles analyzed before and after reaction were found to have a coarse and random morphology. No flat surfaces, crystallites, or other regular structures were observed. RJC. Osbaldiston, E.J. Markel /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 91-706 97 In addition, the irregular surface features were not characterized by a particular scale length: their appearance did not change significantly with changes in magnification from 250 X to 3,000 X to 10,000 X . The energy dispersive capabilities of the electron microscope were used to obtain a semiquantitative measure of cobalt loading in samples prepared by equilibrium adsorption. Catalysts with known cobalt content (3%, 5%, and 10% cobaltocene by weight) were also analyzed to serve as a calibration curve. The X-ray signal from cobalt was integrated for 5 min to maximize the signal/noise ratio. In addition, eight areas were tested on each catalyst sample, the results being averaged to improve the accuracy of the measurements. Sites were selected to provide a direct line of sight to the energy dispersive detector. The relationship between cobalt loading and integrated X-ray signal intensity was nearly linear, with the catalyst produced by equilibrium adsorption containing slightly less than 10 wt.% cobalt. Additional analyses of all catalysts both before and after TPD/MS analysis show less than 4% of the total cobalt present is lost when the sample is slowly heated to 982 C in helium. Thus, little cobalt loss is expected from catalysts heated to only 400 C in the catalytic reactor. 1 II (c) . ,n r ,. r'n,~f,pv~y~,wWrlsrM.~kHO4 ~l~,t~W~ ~ !4~ (b) (a) . ,..n~n ~,r ~1r~nr~ir~run.w~a~,av..r..u~ ~1.wN 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Two Theta Fig. 3.

Markel /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 91-106 3.3. X-ray diffraction analyses X-ray diffraction patterns for catalysts of 1, 5, and 10 wt.% cobaltocene loading were taken both before and after reaction. In all cases, no crystalline phases were observed. A sharp line at 27 and a heightened baseline in the region of 22 were observed in all analyses and is due to the carbon support (Fig. 3) . The X-ray pattern of the catalyst synthesized using the equilibrium absorption method is slightly different (Fig. 3). The peak at 27 is very strong, about 100 counts per second. The peak at 22 is weak, and a new peak at 21 appears. Also, the baseline between 30 and 60 shows several unidentified small peaks. These new peaks indicate the catalyst produced by equilibrium absorption has a small amount of crystalline material present but the peaks do not correspond to the starting materials or any previously reported inorganic crystalline phase containing cobalt, sulfur, carbon and/or hydrogen [19]. Analyses of catalysts removed from the reactor show no evidence of Co9S8 or any other crystalline materials. 3.4. Temperature programmed decompositionlmass spectroscopy All fresh catalyst samples were tested using TPD/MS methods. At temperatures between 80 C and 200 C, all TPD/MS data are dominated and/or obscured by adsorbed toluene. It was not possible to completely remove toluene from these samples, even by evacuation. Desorption by heating would unacceptably alter the catalyst sample. Fig. 4 shows the TPD/ MS analysis of the catalyst impregnated to 10% cobaltocene loading.

Thermogravimetric analysis of cobaltocene. 600 700 found for the 5% catalyst. The most important feature observed is the presence of large amounts of free cyclopentadiene (mass 65 in the spectrum), even at room temperature. Free cyclopentadiene is observed from 35 C to 80 C, is obscured between 80 C and 200 C by solvent, and reappears between 200 C and 400 C. Less intense ions at masses 59, 124, and 189 are observed at temperatures above 300 C. These ions correspond to cobalt metal, 100 RJC. Osbaldiston, E.J. Markel /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 91-106 cyclopentadienyl cobalt fragments, and intact cobaltocene, respectively. No free cyclopentadiene is observed at these higher temperatures. Similar results are observed for the catalyst prepared by the equilibrium absorption technique, but with one important exception: no free cyclopentadiene is observed at room temperature. Free cyclopentadiene begins to desorb at 137 C and is observed up to 400 C. Less intense cobaltocene and cyclopentadienyl cobalt fragment ions are again observed only at high temperatures (above 300 C) and no free cyclopentadiene is detected in the mixture of cobaltocene and cyclopentadienyl cobalt fragments at high temperature. In addition, the intensity of the high temperature cobalt-containing peaks in the mass spectrum was considerably lower than observed in catalysts prepared by impregnation, even though the cobalt loadings are the same. TPD/MS analysis of cobaltocene provides more low-temperature information because interference from toluene is not encountered (Fig. 5). The data show cobaltocene decomposition begins at 50 C. Cobalt, cyclopentadienyl cobalt and cobaltocene all begin volatizing at 50 C, reach their maximum rate of evolution at 100 C, and continue to evolve steadily at a constant rate until the end of the experiment. Free cyclopentadiene is observed neither at room temperature nor at the onset of cobaltocene decomposition at 50 C. Cyclopentadiene begins to desorb at 100 C, reaches a maximum intensity at 210 C, and disappears at temperatures greater than 350 C. Thermogravimetric decomposition of cobaltocene in nitrogen confirms TPD/MS data for cobaltocene decomposition (Fig. 6). The results show cobaltocene undergoes an abrupt change between 210 C and 230 C, with gradual mass losses throughout the rest of the experiment. Supported catalysts with cobaltocene loadings below 5% did not desorb cobalt-containing fragments at any temperature. Free cyclopentadiene desorbs from these samples at room temperature, but no other compounds or fragments appear in the mass spectra, even though the spectrometer is capable of detecting signals two orders of magnitude smaller than those observed at 5% loading. 4. Discussion 4.1. Catalyst synthesis and characterization TPD/MS data show that a chemical reaction occurs during impregnation of cobaltocene which liberates cyclopentadiene (Cp) C support Co(Cp)2- ~ COCp* +Cp No free Cp is observed in TPD/MS analyses of catalysts formed by equilibrium adsorption because the catalyst was washed thoroughly with excess solvent after the adsorption step. Unbound, purgeable Cp is present in all impregnated catalysts at room temperature and its presence is attributed to interactions with the carbon support because no purgeable Cp is observed in analyses of unsupported cobaltocene. TPD/MS analyses indicate the impregnated cobaltocene-derived surface complexes consist of Cp ligands and cobalt. These complexes are stable to higher temperatures than pure R.J.C. Osbaldiston, EJ. Markel /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 91-106 101 cobaltocene: cobaltocene begins to decompose at 50 C during TPD/MS while the impregnated cobaltocene produces no Co or CpCo fragments until 300 C. In fact, no Co or CpCo fragments are evolved from catalysts with less than 5% loading, even at 982 C. Based on the available information as well as the results of the related reaction of Cbo and cobaltocene, it is proposed that the surface complexes consist of strongly bound CpCo surface ligands at loadings below 5% and more volatile metallocene polymers at higher loadings (Fig. 7). The formation of the metallocene polymer chains [ (C5H5CO ) where n = 3 to 9 ] in reactions of C60 and excess cobaltocene has been shown by mass spectroscopy and IR [ 1 ] . TPD/MS analyses of 5% and 10% cobaltocene on carbon catalysts are identical to analyses of the C6o polymetallocene material [ 1 ] . Additional analyses such as solid state '3C NMR, EXAFS or Mfissbauer spectroscopy are needed to establish the structure of the reaction product and binding geometries in these amorphous materials. Metal complex adducts of Cbo generally show p,2-bridging geometries [ 20-26] , the carbon reactivities resembling those of C=C bonds rather than delocalized 7r systems. Transmission IR, DRIFTS, XRD and FT-Raman analyses provided no additional information about surface structures. X-ray diffraction analyses of catalysts removed from the reactor showed no evidence of a crystalline phase forming on the carbon support. Previous workers have observed the formation of C09Sg in catalysts sulfided at 400 C in the presence of HZS [ 2-8 ] , but much more mild sulfiding conditions were used in this work: the highest HZS/HZ ratios encountered in this work were 3 X 10- 3. If crystalline cobalt-containing phases are to form, mixtures of Co and Co9S8 are expected at equilibrium [ 27 ] . Because neither phase is observed, cobalt either remains strongly bound to the surface or sinters to form amorphous materials. Loss of cobalt by sublimation was found to be minimal. Although TPD/MS analyses indicate some cobalt metal is volatized from 5 and 10% cobaltocene catalysts at high temperatures, EDAX measurements indicate the total amount of metal loss is less than 4% of the total amount of cobalt present. No metal is volatized at cobaltocene loadings of 1 % and 3%, even though the spectrometer was capable of detecting signals two orders of magnitude smaller than the Co and CpCo signals observed during heating of the 5% cobaltocene catalyst. Thus, the cobaltocene-derived surface complexes are tightly bound to the catalyst surface. ca\"`1 co~ ~/ co'~1 Ac. cof/ co% fiV/~Co Oco Fig. 7.

Markel /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 91-106 Similarities between the equilibrium absorption and liquid impregnation catalysts are observed. TPD/MS analyses of the equilibrium adsorption catalyst exhibited similar characteristics to the liquid impregnated ones. Reactivity patterns are also similar: for the catalyst prepared by the equilibrium absorption technique, the selectivities observed at each measured fractional conversion match the values observed from catalysts prepared by the liquid impregnation technique. SEM/EDAX places the total amount of cobalt to be equivalent to that of 10% cobaltocene, but quantitative measurements of desulfurization activity indicate the equilibrium adsorption catalysts have activities intermediate between the activities of 5% and 10% cobaltocene catalysts. No advantages to using the equilibrium adsorption technique are observed. 4.2. Catalytic activity Thiophene turnover numbers were found to be highest at lower loadings, as observed previously in carbon-supported cobalt systems derived from cobalt nitrate. All activities were lower, however, than the activities observed by Duchet et al. [ 13 ] for sulfided cobalt nitrate on carbon catalysts. Differences in turnover numbers may indicate either different metal dispersions or a different site structure. XPS analyses of the cobalt nitrate/carbon catalysts [ 13 ] showed the presence of low valent sulfur. The cobaltocene-derived catalysts were probably not well sulfided by thiophene and may require aggressive sulfiding conditions (e.g. HZS at 400 C) to produce the very high activities reported of the fully sulfided catalysts. Yet, in a previous study of carbon-supported cobalt sulfide complexes, we observed desulfurization activities similar to those of the cobaltocene-derived catalysts (Table 1). 4.3. Catalyst selectivity Catalyst selectivities at 400 C were found to be functions of thiophene conversion over a range of catalyst loading and reactant space velocity (Fig. 2). The selectivities also were found to be independent of the catalyst synthesis procedure: catalysts prepared by equilibrium adsorption exhibit the same selectivity trends as those prepared by cobaltocene impregnation. Butenes were the dominant HDS product under all test conditions, comprising approximately 90% of all products. All three butene isomers (1-butene, cis-2-butene, and traps-2-butene) were observed, but the ratio of the isomers was not constant. At high conversions, the distribution of butenes approaches equilibrium, but at low conversions, 1butene and cis-2-butene are favored. Very small amounts of butane are formed. Values were found to range from 1% to 2% of the total C4 desulfurization product pool. This result is interesting because butane is the reaction product expected if hydrogenation reactions are at equilibrium. Previous studies of carbon-supported cobalt catalysts derived from aqueous cobalt ions [ 13 ] and organometallic clusters [ 15 ] report substantially higher selectivities for butane at the same conversions. Thus, hydrogenation side reactions are not at equilibrium over the cobaltocene/carbon catalysts and the ratio of the rates of butene hydrogenation and thiophene desulfurization is much lower than in the other carbon-supported cobalt catalyst systems. Furthermore, the expected systematic trends in butane selectivity are not observed. Selectivity for butane is R.J.C. Osbaldiston, E.J. Markel /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 91-106 103 expected to increase with conversion by equilibrium, yet this increase is not observed experimentally. Higher conversions than reported herein are required to increase selectivity for butane. The rate of butene hydrogenation relative to the rate of desulfurization was too small to measurably affect butane selectivity. Butadiene comprises less than 10% of the total C4 pool at any given level of conversion. Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations for C4 hydrogenation reactions predict very low levels of butadiene, indicating hydrogenation reactions are not at equilibrium. Butadiene selectivity is a smooth function of thiophene conversion (Fig. 2) and extrapolation of the butadiene selectivity curve at low conversions shows no butadiene is expected at 0% conversion. Thus, butadiene is not a direct product of desulfurization but instead is formed by dehydrogenation of butene. 4.4. Mechanism of thiophene desulfurization The selectivity data provide some insight into the possible pathways of thiophene desulfurization which is difficult to extract from similar catalysts in which selectivities are substantially altered by high rates of hydrogenation and isomerization reactions. In our previous systematic studies of thiophene desulfurization at low conversions, the butenes were present in equilibrium amounts [15,28]. Using the present data, it is possible to extrapolate low conversion data to 0% conversion to identify the products obtained directly from thiophene and unaltered by hydrogenation and isomerization reactions. Fig. 2 shows thiophene is converted to predominantly 1-butene and cis-2-butene. It is not possible to determine the relative amounts of these isomers because the 1-butene/2-butene ratio and the cis ltrans ratio approach the y axis asymptotically upward. Production of butane directly from thiophene is expected to account for less than 1-2% of all desulfurization. Extrapolation of butadiene selectivities to 0% conversion indicates no butadiene is produced directly from thiophene. Changes in product selectivities at higher conversion levels provide information about side reactions. The low, invariant selectivity for butane indicates butene hydrogenation occurs more slowly than desulfurization. Butadiene selectivities increase from near zero to approximately 10%, indicating butadiene is not produced directly from thiophene but, instead, is produced by dehydrogenation of butene. A corresponding decrease in butene selectivity is observed. Butene isomerization reactions are the most rapid reactions occurring in the system: the butene isomers are converted to an equilibrium distribution at only 4% thiophene conversion levels. The mechanism of thiophene desulfurization in this system in which butene is the direct product of desulfurization is unlike the mechanisms observed in other catalyst systems in which butadiene [ 29-33 ] or butadiyne [ 34] are the predicted products of desulfurization. Instead, primarily 1-butene and cis-2-butene are observed as the direct products of desulfurization. It is proposed that a preference for these isomers instead of traps-2-butene is due to the structures of partially hydrogenated thiophene intermediates. In order to produce butene from thiophene, four hydrogen atoms must be transferred to the carbon chain of thiophene. Addition is expected to begin at the a-carbon, as predicted by the systematic reactivities of organic heterocycles [ 35 ] , followed by reaction at either the 3 or 5 positions to create low energy partially hydrogenated intermediates 2,3-dihydrothiophene and 2,5- 104 RJC.

Surface reactions observed during thiophene desulfurization by Co/C catalysts. Stereochemistry of the dihydrothiophene intermediates is retained in the 1-butene and traps-2-butene formed by the desulfurization (hydrogenolysis) reactions. dihydrothiophene (Fig. 8) . These compounds desulfurize rapidly [ 36,37 ] with the addition of two hydrogen atoms via hydrogenolysis reactions under conditions similar to those used in this study and are not expected to be observed in even trace amounts in our reactions. Hydrogenolysis of 2,3- and 2,5-dihydrothiophene intermediates produces I-butene and cis2-butene, respectively [ 36,37 ] . In this mechanism, the preferential formation of cis-2butene over traps-2-butene (the lower energy isomer) results from the retention of the cis configuration of the carbon backbone of thiophene in the butene product. 5. Conclusions Catalysts were synthesized by reaction of cobaltocene and high surface area carbon. The products of reaction were purgeable cyclopentadiene and cyclopentadienyl cobalt ligands strongly bound to the support. The CpCo ligands may polymerize on the surface to form volatile metallocene sandwich structures (CpCo) at loadings above 3%. The supported catalysts showed unusual and desirable selectivities. The predominant products of desulfurization were butenes. Less than 2% of the total product was butane, even at high conversions, indicating the rate of butene hydrogenation relative to the rate of thiophene desulfurization was very low. By adjusting the reactor space velocity to produce differential conversions of thiophene, the distribution of butene isomers shifted away from thermody- R.J.C. Osbaldiston, E.J. Markel /Journal of Molecular Catalvsis 91 (1994) 91-106 105 namic equilibrium, indicating only cis-2-butene and 1-butene are produced directly from thiophene. Based on the observed selectivities, a mechanism for thiophene HDS over this Co/C catalyst is proposed. This mechanism involves the stepwise addition of four hydrogen atoms to thiophene to produce butenes. In this mechanism, two hydrogen atoms are added in hydrogenation reactions to form 2,3- or 2,5-dihydrothiophene, followed by addition of two hydrogen atoms in rapid hydrogenolysis/desulfurization reactions to form 1-butene and cis-2-butene, respectively. Previously proposed mechanisms involving direct thiophene hydrogenolysis to form butadiene or direct beta hydrogen elimination to form butynes were not observed.

Catalysts were synthesized using a displacement reaction of cobaltocene (Co(C5H5)2) with high surface area carbon to form a strongly bound metal surface complex and free cyclopentadiene. At loadings above 3 wt.%, the surface complexes polymerize to form metallocene sandwich polymers. Unlike pure unsupported cobaltocene, the supported metal complexes are stable up to 300°C in helium. X-ray diffraction analysis of the catalysts indicate the cobalt is highly dispersed with no cobalt-containing crystalline phases present. Thiophene desulfurization measurements find a high selectivity for cis-2-butene and 1-butene. A mechanism for desulfurization by these catalysts is proposed in which 2,3-dihydrothiophene and 2,5-dihydrothiophene intermediates undergo rapid hydrogenolysis/ desulfurization reactions to form 1-butene and cis-2 butene, respectively. Selectivities for butane were below 2%, indicating the catalyst is a very poor hydrogenation catalyst. Keywords Carbon Cobaltocene Desulphurization Supported catalysts Thiophene References [1] R.J.C.
