DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(10)60123-4 The Effect of Preparation Procedure on the Performance of Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 Catalysts for the Direct Oxidation of Ethylene to Acetic Acid XU Shuliang 1,2 , CHU Wenling 2, *, YANG Weishen 2,# 1 National Engineering Laboratory for Methanol to Olefins, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian 116023, Liaoning, China 2 State Key Laboratory of Catalysis, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian 116023, Liaoning, China Abstract: Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 catalysts were investigated to elucidate the effect of preparation procedure on the direct oxidation of ethylene to acetic acid. Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 catalysts with a fixed amount of Pd and SiW 12 were prepared in various ways. The order in which Pd and SiW 12 were loaded on the SiO 2 support and the treatment conditions for the supported Pd have a significant influence on the dispersion of Pd on the Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 catalysts, but no influence on the concentration of B acid sites. The Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 catalyst prepared by simultaneously loading Pd and SiW 12 on the SiO 2 support showed the best catalytic activity. The dispersion of Pd was the main factor in the catalytic ac- tivity. Key words: preparation procedure; palladium; silicotungstic acid; silica; ethylene oxidation; acetic acid Acetic acid is a very important organic acid, which is used in a broad range of applications. It is mainly produced from methanol carbonylation and acetaldehyde oxidation, but both these processes give rise to many problems of corrosion and waste disposal [1–4]. The use of Pd-H 4 SiW 12 O 40 (SiW 12 )/SiO 2 for the direct catalytic oxidation of ethylene to acetic acid, developed by Showa Denko [1], has considerable interest. SiW 12 heteropoly acid has several advantages as a Brönsted acidic catalyst, which makes it economically and environ- mentally attractive [5,6]. The Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 catalyst is a promising material for reactions such as the isomerization of n-pentane and n-heptane [7–9]. Both the palladium catalyst and an acidic support are common features of the catalysts used for the selective oxidation of ethylene to acetic acid [10–13]. With the Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 catalyst, Pd and SiW 12 act as the redox and acidic active sites, respectively. Various parameters, including the Pd precursor [14] and the nature of the support [15], are factors that influence the cata- lytic activity of Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 . Besides these factors, the im- portance of the preparation procedure should also be empha- sized. It has been found that the procedure for the preparation of the Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 catalyst, such as the order of application of Pd and SiW 12 on the SiO 2 support, led to big differences in catalytic performance [7,10,16–18]. Therefore, new experi- mental data on the preparation procedures are needed to elu- cidate these differences. Furthermore, in the preparation proc- ess, the role of treatment conditions for the supported Pd is significant for the dispersion of the active phase. According to the literature [17,18], before loading the SiW 12 , reduction of Pd/SiO 2 by H 2 led to a lower catalytic activity than reduction by hydrazine hydrate (N 2 H 4 ·H 2 O). Despite extensive research work on the design and characterization of the Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 catalyst, the effect of preparation procedure on the catalytic performance for the selective oxidation of ethylene to acetic acid is still unclear. In this report, we describe the influence of the preparation procedure on the catalytic activity of Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 for the direct oxidation of ethylene to acetic acid. The catalyst was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) of adsorbed pyridine, and H 2 -pulse chemical adsorption. The XU Shuliang et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2010, 31: 1342–1346 relationship between Pd dispersion, surface acidity, and cata- lytic properties of the Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 catalyst is discussed. 1 Experimental 1.1 Preparation of the catalysts Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 catalysts with fixed amounts of SiW 12 and Pd, mass loadings 30.0 wt% and 1.0 wt%, respectively, were prepared by various procedures. Commercially available SiO 2 (A BET = 384.7 m 2 /g) was used as the support. The Pd-SiW 12 / SiO 2 catalysts were prepared according to the following dif- ferent procedures shown in Fig. 1. For procedure (A), Pd was first impregnated onto SiO 2 using a solution of PdCl 2 dissolved in 0.1 mol/L HCl. The mixture was stirred vigorously for 3 h, then dried at 343 K until the wet sample became colloidal. Then the Pd/SiO 2 sample was dried in an oven at 383 K overnight. The resulting dry solid was calcined at 523 K in static air for 3 h. Subsequently, SiW 12 was supported on the Pd/SiO 2 by the incipient wetness method from aqueous H 4 SiW 12 O 40 . After vigorously stirring for 3 h, the same procedures as those used in preparing the Pd/SiO 2 sample were used for drying and calcination. This catalyst was denoted as Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 (A). For procedure (B), Pd was first impregnated onto SiO 2 with the preparation process being the same as procedure (A) but the sample was reduced in an aqueous solution of 5% hydrazine hydrate at room temperature for 24 h. The resulting mixed sample was filtered and washed until no N 2 H 4 ·H 2 O was de- tected. The reduced Pd/SiO 2 sample was dried in an oven at 383 K overnight. Finally, SiW 12 was supported by the same incipient wetness method as that in procedure (A). This catalyst was denoted Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 (B). For procedure (C), Pd was first impregnated onto SiO 2 with the preparation process the same as that of procedure (A) but the sample was reduced in a flow of 5% H 2 -95% Ar (30 ml/min) at 523 K for 3 h. Finally, SiW 12 was supported by the same incipient wetness method as used in procedure (A). This catalyst was denoted Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 (C). For procedure (D), first, SiO 2 was added to an aqueous so- lution of H 4 SiW 12 O 40 in the appropriate concentration. The mixture was stirred vigorously for 3 h, then dried at 343 K until the wet sample became colloidal. Then the sample SiW 12 /SiO 2 was dried in an oven at 383 K overnight. The resulting dry solid was calcined at 523 K in static air for 3 h. Subsequently, Pd was supported using the incipient wetness method from a solution of the PdCl 2 dissolved in 0.1 mol/L HCl. The same procedures were used for drying and calcination as used in procedure (A). This catalyst was denoted Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 (D). For procedure (E), simultaneously, Pd and SiW 12 were supported onto SiO 2 using a mixed solution of PdCl 2 dissolved in 0.1 mol/L HCl and an aqueous solution of H 4 SiW 12 O 40 . The mixture was stirred vigorously for 3 h, then dried at 343 K until the wet sample became colloidal. After impregnation, the sample was dried in an oven at 383 K overnight and then cal- cined at 523 K in static air for 3 h. This catalyst was denoted Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 (E). 1.2 Characterization of the catalysts Powder XRD patterns were recorded with a Rigaku D/Max-2500 diffractometer employing Cu K . radiation ( = 0.154 2 nm) in the 2 range 5°–70° with a scan rate of 0.02º/s at 40 kV and 200 mA. FT-IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine were obtained using an FT-IR spectrometer. The samples were pressed into a self-supporting wafer (~10 mg/cm 2 ) and mounted into an in situ quartz IR cell with CaF 2 windows. The nature of the acid sites was investigated using pyridine as the probe molecule. Prior to the experiment, the sample was degassed at 523 K at a pressure of 10 –3 Pa. Pyridine was introduced to the evacuated samples for 10 min at room temperature, followed by evacua- tion at a fixed temperature (room temperature, 423 K, or 523 K) for 0.5 h. Then, a difference IR spectrum was recorded at room temperature. The palladium dispersion was measured by a H 2 -pulse chemical adsorption method using an Autosorb-1/C system at 313 K. In a typical experiment, the sample was first pretreated SiO 2 PdCl 2 Pd/SiO 2 H 4 SiW 12 O 40 Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 5%N 2 H 4 •H 2 O Pd/SiO 2 H 4 SiW 12 O 40 Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 5%H 2 -95%Ar Pd/SiO 2 H 4 SiW 12 O 40 Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 H 4 SiW 12 O 40 SiW 12 /SiO 2 PdCl 2 Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 PdCl 2 , H 4 SiW 12 O 40 Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 (A) (B) (C) (D) (E) Fig. 1.

Hydrogen was removed from the system by evacuating for 2 h. The adsorption isotherm was obtained by measuring the amount of H 2 adsorbed as a function of pressure at 313 K. The specific surface area and pore size distribution of the catalysts were derived from nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms at 77 K using a Counter Omnisorp-100CX apparatus using the BET and BJH methods, respectively. The samples were pretreated at 523 K under high vacuum (1.33 × 10 –4 Pa) for 3 h before the isotherms were recorded. 1.3 Catalytic reaction The direct oxidation of ethylene to acetic acid was per- formed in a fixed-bed flow reactor (stainless steel, 10 mm i.d.). The catalyst (2 ml, 40–60 mesh) was placed in the reactor and pretreated at 523 K for 1 h under a mixed stream of H 2 /He (1:1, vol%) at a flow rate of 60 ml/min. After cooling in a flow of He to the reaction temperature of 423 K, a mixture of the reactant gases (C 2 H 4 :O 2 :H 2 O:He = 50:7:30:13, vol%) was fed into the reactor at a total flow rate of 100 ml/min (SV = 3 000 h –1 ) and a total pressure of 0.6 MPa. A cooling trap filled with water and ice (~273 K) was used to collect the liquid products, which were later analyzed by FID-GC (Agilent 6890) equipped with an FFAP column (30 m × 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.3 m). The outlet gaseous compounds were analyzed by an online TCD-GC (Agilent 6890) with 13X (3 m × 2 mm) and Porapak Q (3 m × 2 mm) columns. 2 Results and discussion The XRD patterns of the Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 catalysts prepared using the various procedures are shown in Fig. 2. No diffrac- tion peak of Pd appeared for all the catalysts, which suggested that Pd was well dispersed on the surface of the catalysts. The samples displayed a wide peak at 2 = 8 o (d = 1.1 nm) that can be attributed to X-ray scattering by non-ordered hydrated SiW 12 polyanions present on the surface as isolated molecular moieties or small clusters containing a few Keggin units [7]. The absence of signals from bulk SiW 12 suggested that it was also well dispersed on the surface of the silica support. This observation is significant because the acidity of supported SiW 12 was related to its dispersion on the support [7,10]. It was reasonable to consider that with a higher SiW 12 dispersion, there are more protons present on the surface of the support. In order to investigate the nature of the surface acid sites (Brönsted and Lewis) of the catalyst, the FT-IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine on the Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 catalysts were re- corded. As shown in Fig. 3, pyridine molecules bonded to Lewis acid sites give a peak at 1 450 cm –1 , while those that interact with Brönsted acid sites (pyridinium ions) displayed absorbance at 1 540 cm –1 . The concentration of the Lewis and Brönsted acid sites, obtained from the integrated absorbance peaks of pyridine at 1 450 and 1 540 cm –1 [19], is shown in Table 1. As can be seen in Table 1, the Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 catalysts prepared using the various procedures possessed mainly Brönsted acid sites although small numbers of Lewis acid sites were also observed. It can be seen that the preparation proce- dure had little influence on the concentration of B acid sites on the Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 catalysts, but had significant influence on the L acid sites. It has been reported [20–22] that the appear- ance of Lewis acid sites on Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 catalysts was due to the presence of Pd 2+ electron-deficient metal sites, which ex- hibited Lewis acidity as a result of the interaction between the metal sites and the acid sites. The difference in preparation procedures can lead to different interactions between the metal sites and acid sites, which explained the difference in the 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 In te n s ity Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 (E) Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 (C) Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 (B) 2 T/( o ) Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 (A) Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 (D) Fig. 2.

Table 2 shows the specific surface areas measured by the BET method, and the dispersion of Pd determined from H 2 -chemical adsorption. On comparing the different Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 catalysts, no significant variation of the surface area was observed. This result indicated that the preparation procedures had little effect on the bulk physical structure of the catalysts. However, it is found that the Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 (E) catalyst prepared by simultaneously supporting Pd and SiW 12 on the SiO 2 support showed a better dispersion than those catalysts prepared by the other procedures. This clearly indi- cated that the dispersion of the Pd metal was strongly de- pendent on the preparation procedures, and decreased in the following order: (E) > (D) > (B) > (A) > (C). It is obvious that impregnating Pd first on the SiO 2 support or reduction of supported Pd was unfavorable for the dispersion of Pd on the Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 catalysts. Table 3 shows the catalytic performance for the oxidation of ethylene to acetic acid on the various Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 catalysts after 2 h reaction time. The catalytic properties strongly de- pended on the preparation procedure. The conversion of eth- ylene, space-time yield (STY) of acetic acid, and selectivity for acetic acid decreased in the order: Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 (E) > Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 (D) > Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 (C) > Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 (A) > Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 (B). The Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 (E) catalyst prepared by simultaneously loading Pd and SiW 12 on the SiO 2 support gave the best catalytic activity. The Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 (D) catalyst, which was obtained by first impregnating SiW 12 on the SiO 2 support, also exhibited better catalytic properties than those prepared by impregnating Pd first. As was concluded about the Pd dispersion, it can be seen that impregnating Pd first on the SiO 2 support or reduction of supported Pd was unfavorable for the catalytic performance of the Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 catalysts. In the literature [8–10], it was suggested that the direct oxidation of ethylene on Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 catalysts take place bifunctionally by cooperation between Pd species and the acid sites of the support. In the present study, the B acid sites of the catalysts prepared by various procedures were rather similar. It is well known that Pd itself plays a vital role in the selective oxidation of ethylene to acetic acid [23,24]. Usually, the cata- lytic properties of supported Pd catalysts were dependent on the Pd dispersion. Thus, the catalytic performance of the Pd- SiW 12 /SiO 2 catalysts prepared by the various procedures was mainly controlled by the dispersion of palladium for similar concentrations of B acid sites. This is in agreement with the result of our experiment, which showed that the catalytic per- formance of the Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 catalysts prepared by the various procedures was dependent on the dispersion of palla- dium. 3 Conclusions A series of Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 catalysts prepared by various procedures and their catalytic performance in the selective oxidation of ethylene to acetic acid was investigated. The numbers of B acid sites of the catalysts were similar. The order in which Pd and SiW 12 were supported on SiO 2 and the treat- ment conditions for the supported Pd catalysts had a significant influence on the dispersion of Pd. The catalytic activity was dependent on the dispersion of palladium. The Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 catalyst prepared by simultaneously supporting Pd and SiW 12 on SiO 2 gave the best catalytic performance for the selective oxidation of ethylene. This was attributed to the better disper- sion of palladium.

XU Shuliang et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2010, 31: 1342–1346 preparation procedures mainly influenced the dispersion of palladium and did not influence the concentration of surface acid sites. Thus, the high activity of the Pd-SiW 12 /SiO 2 catalyst can be assigned to the high dispersion of Pd. References 1 Sano K, Uchida H, Wakabayashi S.

Tel: +86-411-84379073; Fax: +86-411-84694447 Pd-SiW12/SiO2 catalysts were investigated to elucidate the effect of preparation procedure on the direct oxidation of ethylene to acetic acid. Pd-SiW12/SiO2 catalysts with a fixed amount of Pd and SiW12 were prepared in various ways. The order in which Pd and SiW12 were loaded on the SiO2 support and the treatment conditions for the supported Pd have a significant influence on the dispersion of Pd on the Pd-SiW12/SiO2 catalysts, but no influence on the concentration of B acid sites. The Pd-SiW12/SiO2 catalyst prepared by simultaneously loading Pd and SiW12 on the SiO2 support showed the best catalytic activity. The dispersion of Pd was the main factor in the catalytic activity. 摘要 ： 采用不同负载顺序或制备过程制备了 Pd-SiW12/SiO2 催化剂, 考察了它们在乙烯直接氧化制乙酸反应中的催化性能. 结果表明, Pd 和 SiW12 的负载顺序与 Pd 负载后的处理条件对 Pd-SiW12/SiO2 催化剂上 Pd 的分散度影响较大, 但对催化剂表面 B 酸量影响不大, 而 Pd 分散度较高时, 相应催化剂活性较高. 将 Pd 和 SiW12 同时负载于 SiO2 上时, 催化剂表现出较高的催化乙烯直接氧化制乙酸反应活性.
