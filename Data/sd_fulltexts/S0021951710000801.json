Both bulk metal phosphides with special morphology and supported metal phosphides that are used as catalysts can be synthesized by this synthetic approach. This paper presents a novel synthetic approach to synthesizing metal phosphides. Both bulk and supported Ni2P, Cu3P, MoP, and InP were synthesized by thermal decomposition of their metal oxide and hypophosphite precursors. Mechanistic studies of Ni2P were carried out using a separated-bed tube reactor, and the result indicates that NiO is reduced by PH3 (produced from decomposition of NaH2PO2) at 300°C. Ni2P hollow spheres were successfully synthesized by this method, which indicates that it is possible to synthesize metal phosphides with special morphology by using metal oxides with special morphology as precursors. Keywords Metal phosphide Metal oxide Nickel phosphide Sodium hypophosphite Hydrodesulfurization 1 Introduction Metal phosphides have attracted considerable attention because of their advanced catalytic, electronic, and magnetic applications. Among the metal phosphides, nickel phosphide (Ni2P) shows excellent activity in the hydrotreating of crude oil fractions such as gasoil and naphtha [1]. The good cyclability and fair reversible capacity of copper phosphide (Cu3P) can make it an alternative negative electrode in special battery designs [2]. In particular, the second-generation semiconductor material indium phosphide (InP) has various applications in telecommunications, optoelectronic devices, and solar cells [3]. It is well known that there are many ways to synthesize metal phosphides. These include temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) of metal phosphates [4] or metal phosphites [5,6], solvothermal reactions [7], decomposition of single-source precursors [8], high temperature annealing of preformed nanoparticle precursors [9], the reduction of metal oxide nanoparticles by PH3/H2 [10], the reaction of trioctylphosphine (TOP) with metal salts [11], the conversion of preformed metal nanoparticles into metal phosphides by solution-mediated reaction with TOP [12], the decomposition of nickel thiophosphate (NiPS3) [13,14], the reduction of oxide precursors in a hydrogen plasma [15], and the decomposition of metal hypophosphites [16,17]. Herein, we describe a modified approach for synthesizing metal phosphides. In contrast to the previous methods, our approach uses bulk or supported metal oxide as precursor. Both bulk and supported Ni2P, Cu3P, MoP, and InP can be synthesized by this method under mild conditions, which is more universal than the decomposition of metal hypophosphites [16,17]. On the one hand, metal nitrates are easily purchased and have a better solubility than metal chlorides, which is advantageous to the synthesis of supported metal phosphides. On the other hand, some supported metal phosphides could not be synthesized from metal chlorides. For instance, CuCl2 and NaH2PO2 will be rapidly precipitated in the solution; thus, it is difficult to synthesize supported Cu3P from the decomposition of metal hypophosphites. Interestingly, the morphology of the metal phosphides can be successfully inherited from the metal oxide precursors, which indicates that it is possible to synthesize metal phosphides with special morphology by using metal oxides with special morphology as precursors. Therefore, both bulk metal phosphides with special morphology and supported metal phosphides that are used as catalysts can be synthesized by this new synthetic approach. Similar to our previous work [16], the synthesis is not affected by the heating rates. It only requires a simple calcination in a static Ar atmosphere. 2 Experimental methods 2.1 Synthesis of bulk and supported metal phosphide Alumina (Tianjin Research Institute of Chemical Industry) was calcined at 600°C for 3h and had a specific surface area of 212m2 g−1, a pore volume of 0.39cm3 g−1, and a Barett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) average pore size of 4.8nm. Siliceous MCM-41 (Tianjin Chemist Scientific Ltd.) had a specific surface area of 889m2 g−1, a pore volume of 1.01cm3 g−1, and a BJH average pore size of 3.32nm. All reagents were analytical pure grade and purchased from Tianjin Guangfu Fine Chemical Research Institute, China. In a typical experiment, metal phosphide was obtained as follows. The stoichiometric amount of sodium hypophosphite was dissolved in deionized water with magnetic stirring to form a clear solution. Then metal oxide was added, which was obtained by the calcination of metal nitrate (Ni(NO3)2 for Ni, Cu(NO3)2 for Cu, (NH4)6Mo7O24 for Mo, and In(NO3)3 for In) at 500°C for 2h in a muffle furnace. Then, the slurry was evaporated slowly to dehydrate the product, and the product was dried at 80°C for 8h and subsequently heated at the required temperature (300°C for Ni and Cu, and 400°C for Mo and In, which was set according to the initial hydrogen reduction temperatures of their metal oxides) for 0.5h in a static Ar atmosphere. The product was cooled to ambient temperature under Ar, washed three times with deionized water, and dried at 120°C for 3h. To make the supported metal phosphide by impregnation, a certain amount of support was added to the solution of the metal nitrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24 for Mo). The sample was dried at 120°C for 3h, and supported metal oxide was obtained by the calcination of sample at 500°C for 2h in a muffle furnace, and the remaining steps were similar as those described above. In our approach, a 10% excess of P was used when supported metal phosphide was synthesized. 2.2 Characterization and activity test Powder X-ray diffraction was performed on a Rigaku D/Max-2500 diffractometer, with Cu Kα at 40kV and 100mA. The compositions of the sample were measured by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were acquired using a Philips Tecnai G2 F-20 field emission gun transmission electron microscope. Nitrogen adsorption was measured with a BEL-MINI adsorption analyzer. The H2-TPR and CO chemisorption were performed with Micromeritics chemisorb 2750 gas-adsorption equipment. The sample was loaded into a quartz reactor and pretreated in 10% H2/Ar at 450°C for 3h. After cooling in He, pulses of 10% CO/He in a He carrier (25cm3 (NTP) min−1) were injected at 30°C through a loop tube. The electrochemical response of the samples was tested on a Land CT2001C instrument. The bulk copper phosphide was used in a two-electrode cell using metallic lithium as the negative electrode. The discharge and charge capacities were measured at 0.01–3.5V and at a C/10 rate (37.7mAg−1). The HDS catalytic activities were evaluated using 3000ppm dibenzothiophene (DBT) in decalin. The testing conditions for the HDS reaction were 330°C, 3MPa, WHSV=6h−1, with a H2 flow rate of 160mLmin−1. Liquid products were collected every hour after a stabilization period of 6h. Both feed and products were analyzed with a FULI 9790 gas chromatograph equipped with an FID detector and an OV-101 column. The DBT conversion and turnover frequency (TOF) [18] were used to evaluate the HDS activity. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis of bulk and supported metal phosphide and activity As shown in Fig. 1 , the typical diffraction peaks of the samples are clearly shown, which indicate that bulk Ni2P, Cu3P, MoP, and InP were prepared from thermal decomposition of their metal oxide and sodium hypophosphite precursors. We chose mesoporous MCM-41 as the support to synthesize supported metal phosphides. The XRD patterns of the samples show that supported Ni2P, Cu3P, MoP, and InP were successfully prepared by treating the MCM-41-supported mixed salt precursors (Fig. S1). The ICP results showed that the composition of Ni2P/MCM-41 (nickel loading 5wt%) was Ni/P=1/0.59, and no sodium ion was detected, which were almost the same with the results of bulk nickel phosphide. It is notable that both bulk and supported Cu3P can be synthesized by this method. It provided a way to use supported Cu3P as a catalyst for some reactions, because other methods to synthesize supported Cu3P are very difficult. Hollow NiO microspheres were prepared according to the method of Wang et al. [19]; the microspheres are built from two-dimensional 100–500nm nanosheets. Interestingly, hollow Ni2P spheres were successfully synthesized by thermal decomposition of the as-synthesized hollow NiO spheres and sodium hypophosphite at 300°C for 0.5h. The XRD patterns of the as-prepared hollow Ni2P spheres are exactly the same as that of pure Ni2P. The structure of as-prepared Ni2P microspheres was confirmed by TEM. Fig. S2a and S2b show typical TEM images of as-prepared Ni2P microspheres. We can see that the diameter of the sphere is about 3.2μm. As shown in Fig. S2c, the magnified HRTEM image of the frame selected from image (b) yields a d-spacing of 0.503nm for the (100) crystallographic planes of Ni2P, which is in good agreement with the calculated value. The formation of hollow Ni2P microspheres indicates that it is possible to synthesize metal phosphides with special morphology by using metal oxides with special morphology as precursors. The catalytic activities of Ni2P/Al2O3 and Ni2P/MCM-41 prepared by thermal decomposition of supported NiO and NaH2PO2 were tested by the removal of sulfur from DBT in the HDS reaction. Table 1 shows a comparison of HDS activities of the catalysts prepared using different methods. The results indicated that both Ni2P/Al2O3 and Ni2P/MCM-41 catalysts prepared using two methods show similar high HDS activity. The results of electrochemical tests of the bulk Cu3P electrode are given in Fig. S3, which are similar to those reported by Pfeiffer et al. [2]. However, far from being a competitor material for graphite, the good cyclability and fair reversible capacity of Cu3P can make it an alternative negative electrode in special battery designs. 3.2 Investigation of the formation process We decided to use Ni2P/MCM-41 as a typical phosphide to investigate the formation process of the metal phosphide. We propose that the following possible reactions occurred at 300°C. (1) 2 NaH 2 PO 2 = PH 3 ↑ + Na 2 HPO 4 (2) 4 PH 3 + 6 NiO = 3 Ni 2 P + P + 6 H 2 O A separated-bed experiment was designed to prove that PH3 can be produced from reaction (1) and that NiO can be reduced by PH3 at 300°C in reaction (2). As shown in Fig. S4, 30wt% NiO/MCM-41 and NaH2PO2 were separated by 5-mm quartz fiber and treated at 300°C for 0.5h in flowing Ar. The amount of NaH2PO2 was insufficient to completely reduce the nickel oxide. The existence of the typical diffraction peaks of Ni2P indicate that NiO can be reduced by PH3 at 300°C, which is similar to those reported by Yang et al. [10]. At the same time, this also means that PH3 could be obtained from decomposition of NaH2PO2 at 300°C. No diffraction peaks of Ni were found in the XRD patterns, so PH3 might be directly reduced NiO to Ni2P without generating intermediate Ni. Compared with the TPR of the metal phosphate, Ni2P could be obtained at a low temperature from thermal decomposition of nickel oxide and sodium hypophosphite. The main reason is that the Ni–O bond is weaker than the P–O bond, and nickel oxide could be easily reduced by PH3 at a low temperature. From the H2-TPR results of metal oxides, we found that the initial hydrogen reduction temperatures of NiO, CuO, MoO3, and In2O3 were 275, 210, 373, and 355°C, respectively (Fig. S5). We perhaps could estimate the synthesis temperature of metal phosphides from the initial hydrogen reduction temperature. In our experiments, Ni2P, Cu3P, MoP, and InP were synthesized at 300, 300, 400, and 400°C, respectively. 4 Conclusions In summary, both bulk and supported Ni2P, Cu3P, MoP, and InP were synthesized by thermal decomposition of their metal oxide and hypophosphite precursors. It is notable that the temperature of thermal decomposition is lower than for the TPR method, and this reaction does not require temperature programming. Mechanistic studies of Ni2P were carried out using a separated-bed tube reactor, and the result indicates that NiO can be reduced by PH3 (produced from decomposition of NaH2PO2) at 300°C. At the same time, we found that PH3 might be directly reduced NiO to Ni2P without generating intermediate Ni. Ni2P hollow spheres were successfully synthesized by this method, which indicates that it is possible to synthesize metal phosphides with special morphology by using metal oxides with special morphology as precursors.

        "dc:description": "This paper presents a novel synthetic approach to synthesizing metal phosphides. Both bulk and supported Ni2P, Cu3P, MoP, and InP were synthesized by thermal decomposition of their metal oxide and hypophosphite precursors. Mechanistic studies of Ni2P were carried out using a separated-bed tube reactor, and the result indicates that NiO is reduced by PH3 (produced from decomposition of NaH2PO2) at 300°C. Ni2P hollow spheres were successfully synthesized by this method, which indicates that it is possible to synthesize metal phosphides with special morphology by using metal oxides with special morphology as precursors.",
