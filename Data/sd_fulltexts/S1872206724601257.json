Pd-based homogenous catalyst has been used for the urea synthesis, however the aggregation of Pd(0) species leads to the deactivation of the catalyst even under mild conditions. Here, we present a photon-involved carbonylation of amines to synthesize ureas, achieving product yields of up to 99%, using Pd(OAc)2 and KI without losing the performance owing to the fast regeneration of Pd species under light irradiation. Reaction kinetics results and ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra indicate the regeneration of the Pd species is realized by the light irradiation (below 450 nm) which induces the oxidation reaction between HI and O2 to produce I2, so that the active species PdI2 is regenerated through the reaction between Pd(0) and the I2. Graphical Abstract The reoxidation of Pd(0) species to Pd(II) is achieved through a photo-mediated method, which is successfully employed for the oxidative carbonylation of amines to synthesize symmetric and unsymmetric ureas under mild conditions. Keywords Photochemistry Carbonylation Pd catalysis Pd regeneration Urea Substituted ureas are important organic compounds present in nature and the manufacture of agrochemicals such as pesticides, herbicides, and pharmaceutical molecules as well [1–7]. The classic methods for synthesis of ureas involve the reaction of amines with phosgene (Scheme 1(A) ), triphosgene or isocyanate [8,9]. However, these reagents are notorious for their high toxicity or corrosive properties, and it is highly desirable for developing environmentally friendly approach. Carbonylation represents a significant category of organic reactions [10,11]. Among these, the Pd-catalyzed oxidative carbonylation of amines is recognized as an efficient method for urea synthesis [12–16]. However, the sluggish electron transfer rate between Pd(0) and O2 leads to the rapid aggregation of generated Pd(0), resulting in the formation of Pd black, causing the reaction terminated [17–19]. Although the introduction of electron-transfer mediators (ETMs) can significantly enhance the re-oxidation of Pd(0) to Pd(II), via stepwise electron transfer between Pd, ETMs, and O2, due to the sluggish oxidation kinetics of ETMs, these reactions require operation conditions under elevated temperatures/pressures as depicted in Scheme 1(B) [20–23]. To achieve mild reaction conditions, Han et al. [24] utilized a substantial quantity of NaI as ETM and DBACO additives to facilitate the Pd-catalyzed oxidative carbonylation of amines for urea synthesis, which also shows reduced catalyst efficiency and limitation of substrate to primary amines. In recent years, photo-induced catalytic reactions have attracted considerable interest from organic chemists [25–27]. Wu et al. [28] reported a visible-light-induced, palladium-catalyzed dehydrogenative carbonylation method for amines under oxidant-free conditions, resulting in the formation of oxalamide rather than urea. Herein, we report a photon-induced re-oxidation of HI process to facilitate the regeneration of Pd(II) for the oxidative carbonylation of various amines, producing both symmetric and unsymmetric ureas with high conversion and selectivity levels, reaching up to 99%, by using Pd(OAc)2 and KI under room temperature and atmospheric pressure (Scheme 1(C)). To accelerate stepwise electron transfer between Pd, ETMs and O2 under ambient conditions in the Pd-catalyzed oxidative carbonylation process of amines, we attempted to introduce light in the experiments using morpholine as the model substrate (Table 1 ). Encouragingly, the desired product was obtained with 87% conversion and 99% selectivity with blue LED light irradiation (entry 1). Subsequently, the different Pd sources was also examined, the results suggest that Pd(OAc)2 and PdCl2 show comparable conversion and selectivity (entries 1‒4). It is noteworthy that a reduction in the amount of Pd(OAc)2 leads to a significantly decrease in product yield to 57%, while an increase in the amount of Pd(OAc)2 only marginally improve the yield to 91% (entries 5, 6, Fig. S1). Control experiments show that the absence of Pd(OAc)2 results in no product (entry 7). And the reaction hardly proceeds without KI, light irradiation or O2 (entry 8‒11), only with Pd black formation. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of various solvents on the reaction. It is shown that acetonitrile gives the highest activity (entry 1 vs. 12‒14), displaying a positive correlation with their dielectric constants (Fig. S1) [29]. Among the iodine compounds KI, tetraethylammonium iodide (TEAI), tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI) and I2 used, KI shows highest performance (entry 1 vs. 15‒17), while KBr displays no products (entry 18), indicating the essential role of iodine. In addition, we also optimized the amount of KI (Fig. S2). 98% yield is obtained by prolonging the reaction time to 24 h (Fig. S3). Under the optimal reaction conditions, a variety of amines were investigated (Scheme 2(A) ). Notably, the use of aliphatic amines shows 63% to 96% yields of ureas (2a‒2h). Particularly, aliphatic amines with a benzene ring, such as unsubstituted benzylamine (1d) and benzylamine with electron-donating (1e) or electron-withdrawing substituents (1f,1g), result the yields ranging from 91% to 94% (2d‒2g). Interestingly, the steric hindrance effect has less influence on the performance. In cases where benzylamines bear substituents at the 2-position of benzene ring (1g) or the α-position of the amino group (1h), the yields remain at 91% and 95%, respectively (2g,2h). Furthermore, this method also exhibits excellent activity towards aromatic amines. Aniline yields a 96% product (2i). In the presence of electron-donating substituents on the benzene ring of aniline, the desired product can still be obtained in high yields, 97% and 99% are obtained when utilizing p-methyl aniline and p-methoxy aniline, respectively (2j,2k). Conversely, the reaction fails to proceed in the presence of an electron-withdrawing substituent, such as ‒Cl. This suggests that the nucleophilicity of the amino group significantly influences the reaction. Typically, the production of unsymmetric ureas necessitates the reaction between isocyanates, diazo compounds, or amide compounds with amines [30–33]. Nevertheless, these methodologies deviate from the principles of green chemistry. Our approach is also suitable for synthesizing unsymmetric ureas (Scheme 2(B)). 98% yields can be achieved when employing morpholine as the substrate and pairing it with either n-hexylamine or benzylamine (2ab,2ad). Similarly, a 70% yield is attained using cyclohexylamine as the reaction pair (2ac). Additionally, the combination of n-hexylamine and benzylamine in the reaction system yields a 72% target product (2bd). To understand the role of light in the reaction, we did more investigations. The reaction hardly proceeds without KI or light irradiation, only with Pd black formation. This observation suggests a synergistic promotion of Pd(0) re-oxidation by iodine and light. Without light and O2, 20 mol% of I2 was used to replace KI, and the yield based on I2 of final product can be 85% (Fig. 1(A) ). This result indicates an in-situ generation of I2 species during the reaction process. When 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl- 1-piperidinyloxy (TEMPO) is introduced as a radical-trapping reagent into the reaction system, the product yield drops to only 3% (Fig. 1(B)). At the same time, TEMPO-iodine and TEMPO-hydrogen adducts are detected in the mass spectrum (Figs. S4, S5). These findings imply the generation of HI during the reaction, and the photo-oxidation of HI to produce I2 proceeds via a radical mechanism. After treating the HI solution in an O2 atmosphere under light (HI-O2-light) or in darkness (HI-O2-dark), the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectrum was performed (Fig. 1(C)). The HI-O2-light absorption spectrum shows a notable decrease in the absorption peak of HI at 247 nm, accompanied by a discernible increase in the absorption peak of I2 at 292 nm. Conversely, there was no notable alteration observed in the HI-O2-dark absorption spectrum. These results illustrate HI exhibits a higher susceptibility to be oxidized to I2 by O2 when exposed to light illumination compared to the reaction conditions without light. The UV-vis absorption spectrum of the HI solution containing Pd black, treated under light (HI-Pd-O2-light) or in darkness (HI-Pd-O2-dark) in an O2 atmosphere are shown in Fig. 1(a). HI-Pd-O2-light absorption spectrum reveals that the absorption peak of HI at 247 nm almost completely vanishes, while the peak at 292 nm undergoes a significant increase, indicating the oxidation of HI to I2. Concurrently, an absorption peak attributed to PdI2 emerges at 217 nm, suggesting the formation of PdI2. As a comparison, no change is observed in the HI-Pd-O2-dark absorption spectrum, indicating the absence of any reaction. Furthermore, the UV-vis absorption spectrum of the I2 solution containing Pd black treated in darkness (I2-Pd), shows an absorption peak at 217 nm attributed to PdI2 emerges, suggesting that the PdI2 can be formed through reaction of I2 and Pd without light. These results indicate the regeneration of the Pd species is realized by the photon, in which light irradiation induces the regeneration of I2 from HI and O2 and the active species PdI2 can be produced between Pd(0) species and I2. We hypothesize that under photoexcitation, HI is predisposed to produce iodine radicals and hydrogen radicals. The iodine radicals tend to self-aggregate, forming I2, while hydrogen radicals undergo oxidation by O2, resulting in the formation of water. We also conducted experiments to investigate the impact of varying wavelengths of light on the catalytic activity (Figs. 1(E) and S6). Remarkably, we observed reaction activity only when the wavelength is shorter than 450 nm. This observation aligns with the UV-visible absorption spectrum of HI (Fig. 1(D)). Based on the verification reactions mentioned above and the previously reported results [34–40], the reaction process can be divided into the Pd-catalyzed process and the Pd regeneration process as described in Scheme 3 . In the Pd-catalyzed process, initially, PdI2, generated in situ via ligand exchange between Pd(OAc)2 and KI, reacts with an amine to form palladium-amine intermediate ii and HI. Subsequently, a CO insertion reaction occurs, leading to the formation of a palladium carbamoyl intermediate iii . For secondary amines, intermediate iii follows pathway a to yield the desired product and HI through nucleophilic displacement and reduction elimination, while for primary amines, intermediate iii may alternatively proceed via pathway b to yield HI and urea through β-elimination and nucleophilic addition. In the Pd regeneration process, the produced HI undergoes photolysis, resulting in the generation of iodine radicals and hydrogen radicals. Subsequently, the iodine radicals combine to form I2, while the hydrogen radicals react with O2 to produce H2O. The I2 then reacts with Pd(0) to regenerate the catalytic species PdI2, completing the catalyst cycle. To demonstrate the practical applicability of this method, we conducted both scale-up experiments and the synthesis of pharmaceutical molecules (Scheme 4 ). Dimorpholinomethanone (2a), a compound with potential applications as a thermal stabilizer in polymers [41] and as a fundamental element for a coupling agent in peptide synthesis [42], was selected as the target compound. For the gram-scale synthesis of this urea, morpholine was used as the substrate, resulting in a moderate yield of 64% (Scheme 4(A)). Diethylcarbamazine (DEC, 2lm), a widely used antifilarial drug [43], is traditionally synthesized by converting diethylamine into diethylaminoformyl chloride, followed by reacting with N-methylpiperazine to obtain the desired product [44]. Employing this established methodology, we successfully synthesized the drug molecules (Scheme 4(B)). The direct reaction of N-methylpiperazine with diethylamine yields the drug molecules with a 59% yield. Increasing the substrate amounts to 5 mmol N-methylpiperazine and 10 mmol diethylamine maintains the product yield at 46%. Additionally, the regeneration of Pd(II) is crucial in Pd-catalyzed aerobic oxidation reactions, such as aerobic oxidative carbocyclization [45,46], desulfurization coupling reactions [47], and decarboxylative coupling reactions [48]. We propose that this strategy offers a viable approach for these types of reactions. In summary, we have founded a photon-induced regeneration of Pd based catalyst for the oxidative carbonylation of amines to urea. The reaction takes place by employing the catalyst system comprising of Pd(OAc)2 and KI under light irradiation. This catalyst system enables the efficient synthesis of both symmetric and unsymmetric ureas, yielding up to 99%. Mechanistic studies indicate that photons play a crucial role in the regeneration of I2 from HI and O2 via radical mechanism, subsequently producing the active species PdI2 via the reaction of I2 and Pd(0). This provides an efficient approach to re-oxidize the Pd(0) under mild conditions, and affords a feasible strategy for conducting oxidative reactions under light irradiation and ambient conditions.
