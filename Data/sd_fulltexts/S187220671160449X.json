There are several advantages to the current process over the standard procedures available in the literature, including shorter reaction times (7â€“14 min), higher yields, facile work-up, and minimal environmental impact. Furthermore, the catalyst can be conveniently recovered and reused. Key words: 1,8-dioxodecahydroacridine; solvent-free condition; tetrabutylammonium hexatungstate 1,4-Dihydropyridines (1,4-DHPs) have been the subject of considerable attention because of their wide range of pharma- ceutical and biological properties, including antitubercular, antibacterial, antihypertensive, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory effects [1â€“5]. 1,4-DHPs are also commer- cially used as calcium channel blockers for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension [6,7]. Fur- thermore, dimeric 4-aryl-1,4-DHPs have been shown to act as HIV-1 protease inhibitors [8,9]. 1,8-Dioxodecahydroacridines and their derivatives are polyfunctionalized 1,4-DHP deriva- tives and have received less attention than other 1,4-DHP de- rivatives. The most straightforward synthesis of these com- pounds involves the three-component cyclocondensation of 1,3-cyclohexanedione or 5,5-dimethyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione (dimedone) with aromatic aldehydes and ammonium acetate or amines in the presence of a catalyst such as [Hmim]TFA [10], B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 [11], a BrÃ¸nsted acidic imidazolium salt [12], Zn(OAc) 2 [13], proline [14], Amberlyst-15 [15], CeCl 3 Â·7H 2 O [16], silica-bonded S-sulfonic acid (SBSSA) [17], and sil- ica-bonded N-propyl sulfamic acid (SBNPSA) [18]. These compounds have also been synthesized using the classical Hantzsch procedure [19] and by the reaction of aldoximes with dimedone under microwave irradiation and conventional heating conditions [20]. Although each of these individual methods has their own merits, with the exception of the mi- crowave irradiation procedure they all require relatively long reaction times (1â€“7 h). Furthermore, some of these procedures suffer other disadvantages, including the requirement for an expensive catalyst or the use of an excess of catalyst. To avoid these limitations and to improve the reaction conditions available for the synthesis of 1,8-dioxodecahydroacridines, the discovery of new methodologies using new heterogeneous and reusable catalysts is still in demand. The development of heterogeneous catalysts and how they affect specific transformations in chemical synthesis has be- come a major area of research. The potential advantages of these materials over homogeneous systems, in terms of their simplified recovery and reusability, could potentially allow for the development of environmentally benign chemical proce- dures in both academic and industrial settings. Catalysts of this type have the potential to make the processes in which they are applied cleaner, safer, higher-yielding, and relatively in- expensive [21â€“25]. During the course of our recent studies directed towards the development of practical and environ- mentally friendly procedures for the synthesis of organic com- pounds using reusable catalysts [26â€“34], we investigated the Abolghasem DAVOODNIA et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1797â€“1801 application of the isopolytungstate, tetrabutylammonium hexatungstate [TBA] 2 [W 6 O 19 ], as a catalyst for a series of organic transformations. This new reusable heterogeneous catalyst performed well and showed a high level of catalytic activity in the Knoevenagel condensation [35] and Biginelli [36] reactions, as well as in the synthesis of bis-coumarins [37]. This fact prompted us to investigate the catalytic activity of this material in the synthesis of 1,8-dioxodecahydroacridi- nes. 1 Experimental 1.1 Synthesis of tetrabutylammonium hexatungstate [TBA] 2 [W 6 O 19 ] A mixture of sodium tungstate dihydrate, Na 2 WO 4 Â·2H 2 O (99%, 33 g, 0.1 mol), acetic anhydride (40 ml), and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 30 ml) was heated at 100 Â°C for 3 h to obtain a white cream. A solution of acetic anhydride (20 ml) and 12 mol/L HCl (18 ml) in DMF (50 ml) was then added in a drop-wise manner over a period of time with stir- ring, and the resulting mixture was filtered to remove the un- dissolved white solids. A solution of tetrabutylammonium bromide (15.1 g, 0.047 mol) in methanol (50 ml) was then added to the filtrate with rapid stirring to give a white precipi- tate, and the resulting suspension was stirred for 5 min and the product subsequently collected by filtration. Recrystallization from a minimum amount of hot dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) gave the product as colorless diamond-shaped crystals [38]. 1.2 General procedure for the synthesis of 1,8-dioxodecahydroacridines catalyzed by [TBA] 2 [W 6 O 19 ] A mixture of dimedone 1 (2 mmol), aromatic or aliphatic aldehyde 2 (1 mmol), ammonium acetate or aromatic amine 3 (1 mmol), and [TBA] 2 [W 6 O 19 ] (0.04 g, 2 mol% based on the aldehyde) was heated in an oil bath at 120 Â°C for 7â€“14 min. The reaction process was monitored by TLC. Upon completion of the transformation, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and hot chloroform was added. This resulted in the precipitation of the catalyst, which was collected by filtration. The filtrate was then collected and distilled to dryness to give the crude product, which was recrystallized from a mixture of EtOH and H 2 O to give compounds 4aâ€“4q in high yields (Scheme 1). Melting points of the compounds were recorded on a Stuart SMP3 melting point apparatus. The IR spectra were obtained using a Tensor 27 Bruker spectrophotometer from KBr disks. The 1 H NMR (400 and 500 MHz) spectra were recorded with Bruker 400 and 500 spectrometers. 2 Results and discussion The [TBA] 2 [W 6 O 19 ] catalyst was prepared according to the method reported by Fournier [38]. Our efforts to develop an efficient and environmentally benign methodology for the synthesis of 1,8-dioxodecahydroacridines focused initially on the three-component cyclocondensation of dimedone with 4-chlorobenzaldehyde and ammonium acetate as a model reaction. Thus, a catalytic amount of [TBA] 2 [W 6 O 19 ] was added to a mixture of dimedone, 4-chlorobenzaldehyde, and R 1 H O O O [TBA] 2 [W 6 O 19 ] N R 1 R 2 OO + Solvent-free 120 o C + ArNH 2 NH 4 OAc or 1 2 3 4a - 4q 4a:R 1 =C 6 H 5 ,R 2 =H 4b: R 1 = 4-BrC 6 H 4 , R 2 = H 4c: R 1 = 2-ClC 6 H 4 , R 2 = H 4d: R 1 = 4-ClC 6 H 4 , R 2 = H 4e: R 1 = 4-MeC 6 H 4 , R 2 = H 4f: R 1 = 3,4-(MeO) 2 C 6 H 3 , R 2 = H 4g: R 1 = 4-Me 2 NC 6 H 4 , R 2 = H 4h: R 1 = 3-O 2 NC 6 H 4 , R 2 = H 4i: R 1 = 4-O 2 NC 6 H 4 , R 2 = H 4j: R 1 = C 6 H 5 , R 2 = C 6 H 5 4k: R 1 = 4-ClC 6 H 4 , R 2 = 4-MeC 6 H 4 4l: R 1 = 4-MeC 6 H 4 , R 2 = 4-MeC 6 H 4 4m: R 1 = 3-O 2 NC 6 H 4 , R 2 = 4-MeC 6 H 4 4n: R 1 = 4-ClC 6 H 4 , R 2 = 4-MeOC 6 H 4 4o: R 1 = 4-MeC 6 H 4 , R 2 = 4-MeOC 6 H 4 4p: R 1 = Et, R 2 = H 4q: R 1 = n-Pr, R 2 = H Scheme 1.

Pleasingly, we discovered that the reac- tion was efficiently catalyzed by [TBA] 2 [W 6 O 19 ] under sol- vent-free conditions at an elevated temperature, providing a high yield of product 4d. The reaction conditions were then optimized by conducting the reaction at different temperatures and employing different loadings of the catalyst. The results are summarized in Table 1. A low yield of the product was only obtained in the absence of the catalyst at 120 Â°C following a 60 min reaction time (Table 1, entry 1), indicating that the catalyst was necessary to the reaction. The best result was obtained when the reaction was conducted at 120 Â°C in the presence of 0.040 g (2 mol%) of the [TBA] 2 [W 6 O 19 ] catalyst (Table 1, entry 12). To evaluate the scope of this catalytic transformation, the optimized reaction conditions were subsequently applied to the reaction of dimedone 1 with a variety of different aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes 2 in the presence of one of two nitro- gen sources, including ammonium acetate or an aromatic amine 3 (Table 2). A wide range of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes bearing either electron-donating or elec- tron-withdrawing substituents reacted successfully with di- medone and ammonium acetate or aromatic amines to give the corresponding 1,8-dioxodecahydroacridines products in high yields over short reaction times. When an aromatic amine substituted with an electron-withdrawing group was used, however, 1,8-dioxooctahydroxanthenes [39] were formed as the products (Table 2, entries 18â€“20). According to Shenâ€™s report [12], aromatic amines substituted with an elec- tron-withdrawing group are not nucleophilic enough to pro- duce 1,8-dioxodecahydroacridines.

The structures of some products were also confirmed by 1 H NMR analysis. b Isolated yields. Abolghasem DAVOODNIA et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1797â€“1801 odology, we compared our results with those of the other methods reported for the synthesis of 1,8-dioxodecahy- droacridines. This comparison is shown in Table 3. It is clear from the data that our method reduces the reaction times sig- nificantly and provides higher yields of the products. In the interests of green chemistry and developing an envi- ronmentally benign process, the reusability of the catalyst was explored using the model reaction system under the optimized conditions. The catalyst itself could be readily recovered from the reaction mixture according to the procedure outlined in the experimental section. The separated catalyst was washed with cold ethanol and subsequently dried at 60 Â°C under vacuum for 1 h before being reused in a similar reaction. The catalyst could be used at least three times without significant reduction in its activity (93% yield for first use, 93% for second use, and 92% for third use). A plausible mechanism for the formation of the 1,8-dioxodecahydroacridine products using [TBA] 2 [W 6 O 19 ] as a catalyst has been depicted in Scheme 2. Based on our pre- vious reports [35,37], we were aware that [TBA] 2 [W 6 O 19 ] can play a dual role. Thus, we propose that the tetrabutylammo- nium ion [(n-Bu) 4 N + ] induces the polarization of the carbonyl groups, whereas the terminal oxygen atoms or the bridging oxygen atom in the polyoxometalate anion, W 6 O 19 2â€“ , are slightly basic and can promote the necessary reactions. The [TBA] 2 [W 6 O 19 ] can therefore activate the reactants and the intermediates in this reaction. As shown in Scheme 2, we propose that [TBA] 2 [W 6 O 19 ] facilitates the formation of the intermediates I and II that subsequently react together to give the final products 4aâ€“4q. 3 Conclusions The isopolytungstate, [TBA] 2 [W 6 O 19 ], showed high cata- lytic activity in the synthesis of 1,8-dioxodecahydroacridines via the one-pot three-component reaction of dimedone with aromatic or aliphatic aldehydes and ammonium acetate or aromatic amines under solvent-free conditions. This procedure offers several advantages over the other techniques available in the literature, including much shorter reaction times, higher yields, facile workup, and the absence of any hazardous or- ganic solvents, which makes it a useful and attractive protocol for the synthesis of these compounds. Furthermore, the catalyst could be recycled after a simple work-up, and used at least Table 3 Comparison of the efficiencies of different catalysts for the synthesis of 1,8-dioxodecahydroacridines Catalyst Solvent Temperature (ÂºC) Time (min) Yield (%) Ref.

Tel: +98-511-8435000; Fax: +98-511-8424020 Tetrabutylammonium hexatungstate, [TBA]2[W6O19], has been used as an efficient, inexpensive, and recyclable green catalyst for the one-pot three-component synthesis of 1,8-dioxodecahydroacridines by the reaction of dimedone with aromatic or aliphatic aldehydes in the presence of a nitrogen source (ammonium acetate or aromatic amines) under neat conditions. There are several advantages to the current process over the standard procedures available in the literature, including shorter reaction times (7–14 min), higher yields, facile work-up, and minimal environmental impact. Furthermore, the catalyst can be conveniently recovered and reused.
