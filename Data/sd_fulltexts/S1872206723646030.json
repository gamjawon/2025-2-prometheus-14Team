The sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) pose significant challenges for the viability of rechargeable Zn-air batteries. Developing efficient, cost-effective, stable, and dual-purpose oxygen electrocatalysts remains a formidable hurdle. In this study, we successfully synthesized a highly promising chainmail catalyst named FeNi@NC, comprising ultrathin carbon shells encapsulating FeNi alloy nanoparticles on N-doped graphene-like nanosheets. The strong synergistic effects between FeNi alloys and N-doped carbon shells result in outstanding bifunctional catalytic activity, particularly in alkaline media. Consequently, Zn-air batteries incorporating FeNi@NC as the catalyst demonstrate exceptional performance, operating reliably at high power density with extended lifespan. Furthermore, computational analyses provided further confirmation of the catalytic activity and revealed that the electron transfer from FeNi alloy nanoparticles to the carbon shells activates the carbon surface, leading to enhanced catalytic performance. This research not only sheds light on the rational design and synthesis of heteroatom-doped carbon materials supporting the growth-constrained transition metal alloys but also offers a practical solution for advancing the application of Zn-air batteries. Graphical Abstract FeNi alloy nanoparticles, encapsulated in a carbon shell and supported on N-doped graphene nanosheets, have been prepared. This chainmail catalyst demonstrates superior performance in oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, and Zn-air batteries. This enhanced performance is attributed to the synergistic effect between the shell and the alloy. Keywords Zn-air batteries Chainmail catalyst Bifunctional electrocatalyst FeNi alloy Carbon shell 1 Introduction The surge in global energy demand has led to significant depletion of conventional fossil fuels and severe environmental issues. Undoubtedly, the advancement of efficient energy storage and conversion technologies is a crucial research area [1–4]. Rechargeable Zn-air batteries have attracted great research interest due to their high energy density, low cost, environmental friendliness, and safety [5–7]. However, the sluggish kinetic processes of air cathodes limit the development of Zn-air battery technology, namely the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) during discharge and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during charge [8]. Therefore, efficient electrocatalysts are required to promote these two reactions. Usually, electrocatalysts based on noble metals, such as platinum (Pt) for ORR, and Ru and Ir oxides for OER, are typically effective. However, their practical application is inevitably hindered by their unsatisfactory bifunctional catalytic activity, poor stability, low abundance, and high cost [9,10]. Therefore, designing efficient and inexpensive catalysts with bifunctional catalytic activity for ORR and OER remains a great challenge. Over the past decade, researchers have dedicated to develop bifunctional electrocatalysts without noble metals, including transition metals (Fe, Co, Ni, and Mn), metal alloys, oxides, nitrides, hydroxides, and phosphides [11–13]. Among these candidates, transition metal alloys have garnered significant attention due to their affordability and high catalytic activity for both ORR and OER [14,15]. In-depth studies have shown that iron–based catalysts can provide excellent catalytic activity for ORR but their OER catalytic performance is poor, while nickel–based catalysts have outstanding performance in OER [16–18], and undoubtedly, the combination of Fe and Ni is a strategic choice for the development of efficient bifunctional catalysts. It is highly desired to prepare FeNi alloy electrocatalysts with good ORR and OER catalytic activities simultaneously. There has been some progress in this direction [19–21]; however, the metal components continue to exhibit inadequate durability, as repeated redox reactions can result in the dissolution of the metal in aqueous solutions [22]. Balancing catalytic activity and durability of alloy electrocatalysts is one of the major challenges in achieving excellent performance. To address this problem, an effective chainmail strategy is to construct an encapsulation structure with carbon materials. The chemical reaction environment, which typically includes reacting molecules in a liquid solution, temperature, and a variety of physical fields, is like the battlefield on which catalysts fight. The stabilized carbon layer protects the internal metal core from the destructive reaction environment. It is therefore figuratively described as chainmail catalysts. The chainmail should not only be a robust material for separating and protecting the catalyst from corrosive environments, but should also be able to transfer catalytic activity to its outer surface, which then participates in the catalytic reaction. Based on the above consideration, we prepared a chainmail catalyst with ultrathin carbon shell-encapsulated FeNi alloy nanoparticles on graphene-like carbon nanosheets (FeNi@NC). The alloy core transports electrons to the outer carbon atom layer. Benefiting from efficient catalytic activity, fast mass and charge transport at the interface and stable encapsulation structures, the catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic performance for ORR and OER and displayed high power density and long cyclic stability as air cathodes for rechargeable Zn-air batteries. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials preparation Iron acetate tetrahydrate (Fe(CH₃COO)₂·4H₂O), nickel acetate tetrahydrate (Ni(CH₃COO)₂·4H₂O), Glucose (C6H12O6), and melamine (C3H6N6) are purchased from Aladdin. All reagents are analytical grade purity and used as received. Melamine (6.00 g), glucose (0.50 g), iron acetate tetrahydrate (0.07 g) and nickel acetate tetrahydrate (0.07 g) are dissolved in deionized water and stirred magnetically for 5 h, then the solution is dried at 60 °C. The obtained powder is pyrolyzed at 900 °C for 3 h under Ar atmosphere to prepare the target material FeNi@NC. As reference, the control samples are synthesized by a similar process, without adding iron acetate tetrahydrate and nickel acetate tetrahydrate to the precursor to obtain the sample NC, without adding nickel acetate tetrahydrate to obtain the sample Fe3C@NC, without adding iron acetate tetrahydrate, the sample Ni@NC is prepared. To investigate the influence of pyrolysis temperature, the samples obtained at different temperatures (700, 800, 900, and 1000 °C) were prepared, named FeNi@NC-700, FeNi@NC-800, FeNi@NC-900 and FeNi@NC-1000, respectively. 2.2 Materials characterization The structures and morphologies of the synthesized samples are examined with a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-7800F), a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM–2800F), and X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku XtalAB PRO MM007 DW). The surface chemical composition and elementary chemical states are investigated with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi). The elemental content is analyzed with inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Agilent 725ES & Agilent 5110). X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) including extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) at Ni K-edge are collected at easyXAFS300. 2.3 Electrochemical measurements Electrochemical tests are conducted on the CHI760E electrochemical workstation with a standard three-electrode system. The working electrode is fabricated by mixing 5.0 mg of catalyst, 50 mL of 5 wt% Nafion solution, 500 mL of distilled water, and 450 mL of ethanol, followed by sonication for 30 min. Subsequently, 5 mL of this ink is pipetted onto a commercial glassy carbon (GC) electrode (AFE5TOSOGC, 5 mm in diameter, 0.196 cm2, Pine Research Instrumentation) with a syringe, and the electrode is left at room temperature until completely dry. A carbon rod and Ag/AgCl electrodes (saturated with KCl) serve as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Prior to the ORR test, O2 is circulated for 30 min to achieve O2 saturation in the electrochemical cell filled with 0.1 mol L−1 KOH at room temperature. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is performed at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1, and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) is recorded at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 with a rotating speed of 1600 r min−1. Tafel plots are derived from the corresponding LSV curves. All potentials in this study are normalized to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) based on the Nernst equation (E RHE = E Ag/AgCl + 0.198 + 0.059 × pH). Rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) curves are recorded to determine the content of peroxide intermediates. The peroxide yield (HO2 −) and the number of transferred electrons (n) are calculated using the equations below: HO 2 - ( % ) = 100 2 I r / N I d + I r / N n = 4 I d I d + I r / N where I d is the disk current, I r is the ring current, and N is the collection efficiency of the Pt ring and is determined to be 0.38. 2.4 Battery assembly and tests Zn-air batteries are assembled in the following order: a stainless-steel mesh (SSM) current collector, a Zn anode, an alkaline electrolyte, a separator, a carbon cloth coated with catalysts, a gas diffusion layer (GDL), and a current collector. The gas diffusion layer (PLM0), sourced from Changsha Spring New Energy Company, is composed of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and carbon. It has a thickness of 0.32 mm, an air permeability of 30–40 mL cm−2 min−1, a porosity of 10%–15%, and a bending radius of 1 cm. The separator is a hydrophilic Celgard 2340, with a thickness of 38 μm, a porosity of 45%, and a pore size of 0.035 mm. 2.5 Computational details Density functional theory (DFT) computations with spin-polarization are conducted with Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). The Perdew-Burke-Enrzerhof (PBE) parametrization of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) is used to describe the electronic exchange-correlation energies. The D3-Grimme dispersion correction is utilized to accurately characterize weak interactions. Considering the Coulomb interactions in d states of Fe and Ni, we added Hubbard corrections (U eff = 3 eV for the d states of Fe atoms; U eff = 2 eV for the d states of Ni atoms). A cutoff energy of 400 eV for plane–wave basis set is used. During the structure relaxation, the setup of convergence criterion for residual force and energy are 0.03 eV Å−1 and 10−5 eV, respectively. When optimizing structures, one or two bottom layers within slab are fixed to represent the bulk structure of catalyst. Brillouin zones are sampled by a Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh with 2 × 3 × 1, 3 × 3 × 1, 2 × 2 × 1, and 3 × 3 × 1 k-point grid for FeNi@NC, Ni@NC, Fe3C@NC, and NC, respectively. A vacuum space more than 15 Å is employed to avoid the interaction between two periodic units. Two explicit water molecules are added in each model to describe the electrochemical environments of catalysts more realistically. The free energy change (ΔG) of each ORR/OER elementary reaction is calculated as ΔG = ΔE + ΔE ZPE – TΔS where ΔE, ΔE ZPE, T, and ΔS are the reaction energy, zero-point energies correction, temperature, and entropy change, respectively. The free energy correction for adsorbed intermediates is computed with the VASPKIT tool at 298.15 K. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Materials characterization The preparation process is shown in Fig. 1 and the details are presented in the experimental section. The precursor material was obtained by simply mixing and drying the mixture composed of melamine, glucose and inorganic metal salts. In the pyrolysis, melamine can convert into temporary graphitized carbon nitride (g-C3N4) [23]. When the pyrolysis temperature surpasses a specific value (> 750 °C), the aromatic carbon intermediates, which are produced from glucose, condense within the interlayer space of g-C3N4, and g-C3N4 is completely decomposed into highly conductive N-doped graphene-like carbon nanosheets [23,24]. Fe and Ni agglomerate at highs temperature to form alloy nanoparticles, which are encapsulated by ultrathin carbon shells and uniformly distribute on the N-doped graphene-like carbon support. The obtained catalyst is named FeNi@NC. By changing the type of metal salts in the precursor, N-doped carbon (NC) without FeNi alloy nanoparticles, N-doped carbon with Fe3C nanoparticles (Fe3C@NC) and N-doped carbon with Ni nanoparticles (Ni@NC) were also prepared for comparison. This preparation method, which does not necessitate any complex procedures, specific atmospheres, or specialized equipment, can concurrently achieve the doping of heteroatoms into the carbon substrates, the confined growth of transition metals alloys, and the uniform dispersion of alloy nanoparticles on high-conductivity carbon substrates. This provides a general method to design and prepare complex non-precious metal bifunctional electrocatalysts with inexpensive raw materials. The crystal structure of the samples was characterized by XRD. As shown in Fig. S1, for the N-doped carbon material obtained without adding metal salts to the precursor, the peaks around 26.0° and 44.0° are attributed to the (002) and (101) planes of carbon [20]. When both Fe and Ni salts were added to the precursor, Fe and Ni species formed an alloy phase, and the diffraction peaks at 43.5° and 50.7° can be assigned to the (111) and (200) planes of the FeNi alloy [25]. When only Fe salt was added to the precursor, Fe and C form Fe3C alloy phase, and the strong diffraction peaks at 37.6° and 44.6° can be assigned to the (031) and (210) planes of Fe3C [26,27]. When only Ni salt was added to the precursor, Ni metal nanoparticles formed, and the diffraction peaks at 44.3° and 51.7° correspond to the (111) and (200) planes of Ni [25]. The diffraction peaks around 26.0° of the three metal-containing samples belong to the (002) plane of graphitic carbon. The XRD patterns confirm the formation of the FeNi alloy phase in FeNi@NC. As shown in Figs. 2(a) and (b), SEM and TEM of FeNi@NC show many FeNi nanoparticles distributed in the graphene-like carbon matrix. In Fig. 2(c) , high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) clearly reveals a highly crystalline FeNi structure with a lattice spacing of 0.207 nm on the (111) plane of the FeNi alloy. This structure is enveloped by a carbon shell with a lattice spacing of 0.341 nm corresponding to the (002) plane and a thickness of approximately 3–4 nm. This observation confirms that FeNi nanoparticles are encapsulated within a graphene-like carbon shell. Fig. 2(d) presents the elemental mapping of FeNi@NC, which verifies the presence of C, N, O, Fe, and Ni elements in the sample. The N element, derived from the melamine precursor, is uniformly doped in situ into the carbon sheet, and many uniform FeNi alloy nanoparticles are distributed in the graphene-like carbon matrix. As shown in Fig. 2(e), the energy dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS) further proves the existence of Fe and Ni in FeNi@NC, with a mass percentage of 3.00% and 3.06%, respectively. In order to obtain more accurate metal contents, ICP-OES tests were further conducted. The weight percentages of Fe and Ni are 4.13% and 4.25%, respectively. The elemental composition and chemical state of the samples were explored by XPS. Fig. 3(a) is the total spectrum of FeNi@NC, which shows that there are C, N, O, Fe, and Ni elements in FeNi@NC. From Fig. 3(b), the fine spectrum of C 1s of FeNi@NC can be deconvoluted into three peaks at 284.8, 285.8, and 290.3 eV, corresponding to C–C, C–N and C–O. The N 1s fine spectrum consists of pyridine N (398.6 eV), pyrrolic N (400.0 eV), graphitic N (401.3 eV) and oxide N (403.3 eV) (Fig. 3(c)) [8]. The O 1s fine spectrum in Fig. 3(d) can be deconvoluted into three peaks at 530.6, 532.5 and 533.9 eV, corresponding to O2–, OH and adsorbed H2O molecules, respectively. Fig. 3(e) is the fine spectrum of Fe 2p in FeNi@NC, the two peaks around 721.0 and 710.0 eV correspond to the spin-orbit splitting of Fe 2p 1/2 and Fe 2p 3/2, and the peak at 707.4 eV corresponds to Fe0 [28]. Two other peaks located at 710.6 and 713.6 eV can be assigned to Fe2+ and Fe3+ species, respectively [29], which may be due to the surface oxidation of the metal alloy. Fig. 3(f) is the fine spectrum of Ni 2p in FeNi@NC. The two peaks around 872.0 and 855.0 eV correspond to 2p 1/2 and 2p 3/2 of Ni, and the peak at 853.1 eV corresponds to Ni0 [28], the peak at 854.9 eV is attributed to Ni2+, and the peak at 859.8 eV is attributed to the satellite peak. The presence of Fe0 and Ni0 further verifies the formation of FeNi alloy in the FeNi@NC sample. The k 2-weighted Fourier transforms of the EXAFS are utilized to further examine the interaction between Fe and Ni. As depicted in Fig. S3, the Ni–O and Ni–O–Ni interactions of NiO are located at 1.65 and 2.61 Å, respectively. The Ni-Ni interaction of Ni foil is situated at 2.15 Å. FeNi@NC exhibits main peaks around 2.01 Å, which can be attributed to the Ni-Ni/Fe interaction [30]. Notably, the radial distance of FeNi@NC is shorter than that of Ni foil, indicating that alloying leads to Ni–Fe interaction and changes the chemical condition. According to the principle of the XPS, the inner-shell electron binding energy of atoms depends on the chemical environments of atoms; thus the changes of chemical environments could be reflected as shifts of peaks in the XPS. When the atom loses electrons, its inner shell electron binding energy rises; when the atom gains electrons, its inner shell electron binding energy decrease. Therefore, we could correlate the variable binding energies in the XPS of Fe and Ni with the transfer of electrons between carbon shells and alloys. Figs. 3(g) and 3(h) display the binding energy of Fe and Ni in FeNi@NC shift about 0.70 and 0.50 eV in the positive direction compared to pure Fe and Ni metal nanoparticles, suggesting that electron transfer occurs from the FeNi alloy core to the nitrogen-doped carbon shells. As shown in Fig. 3(i), charge transfer occurs at the interface between the metal alloy nanoparticles and the encapsulated shell, which can introduce electronic modifications on the shell and directly affect its adsorption behavior during catalysis, ultimately altering its catalytic reactivity and selectivity. 3.2 Electrochemical performances CV testing was employed in O2 or N2 saturated 0.1 mol L−1 KOH solution to evaluate the ORR catalytic activity of FeNi@NC. As illustrated in Fig. 4(a) , there is no reduction peak in the CV curve recorded in the N2 saturated electrolyte, but the CV curve recorded in the O2 saturated electrolyte has an obvious reduction peak, which indicates that the sample has oxygen reduction activity. To further reveal the dynamic mechanism of the samples for ORR, LSV was performed in O2-saturated 0.1 mol L−1 KOH solution. As illustrated in Fig. 4(b), the onset potentials of Fe3C@NC and FeNi@NC are 0.98 and 0.97 V, respectively, which are comparable to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.97 V) and higher than those of NC (0.84 V) and Ni@NC (0.85 V). The half-wave potentials of Fe3C@NC and FeNi@NC are 0.83 and 0.84 V, respectively, which are significantly higher than the half-wave potential of NC (0.69 V) and even better than the performance of the commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.82 V). The ORR performance is also comparable to that of the reported catalysts (Table S1). After adding Ni salt into the precursor, Fe and Ni form FeNi alloy phase, and the ORR performance from the Fe component is also well maintained. From Fig. 4(c), the Tafel slopes of Fe3C@NC and FeNi@NC are 87 and 84 mV dec−1, which are lower than NC (126 mV dec−1) and even commercial Pt/C catalysts (88 mV dec−1). A lower Tafel slope indicates the faster current density rise and the lower overpotential of the ORR, suggesting that oxygen is more easily adsorbed and activated on the catalyst surface. The LSV curves for ORR of FeNi@NC at different rotational speeds are further tested in 0.1 mol L−1 KOH solution (Fig. 4(d)), and the electron transfer number can be calculated to be about 4 according to the K-L equation (Fig. 4(e)). The disk current and ring current are obtained by the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) test (the inset of Fig. 4(f)), the electron transfer number is close to 4, which is consistent with the calculation of the K-L equation, and the peroxide yield is low (Fig. 4(f)), which indicates that the ORR catalytic process of FeNi@NC is close to the efficient 4e− reaction path. LSV tests were also performed in 0.1 mol L−1 KOH solution to evaluate the OER performance of the samples. As shown in Fig. 4(g), the potential of FeNi@NC at 10 mA cm−2 is 1.71 V, which is close to the value of RuO2 (1.68 V) and significantly smaller than those of Ni@NC (1.81 V) and Fe3C@NC (1.92 V), indicating that the further introduction of Ni salt to form FeNi alloy is of great help for the OER catalytic performance. The corresponding Tafel slope of FeNi@NC (168 mV dec−1) is lower than those of Ni@NC (172 mV dec−1), Fe3C@NC (174 mV dec−1) and NC (190 mV dec−1), demonstrating the excellent OER kinetic performance (Fig. 4(h)). Compared with Fe3@NC, Ni@NC and NC samples, the enhanced OER catalytic activity of FeNi@NC can be attributed to the uniformly distributed FeNi nanoparticles grown within the carbon substrate. The OER performance of FeNi@NC and RuO2 was further tested in 1 mol L−1 KOH solution (Fig. 4(i)). The potential of FeNi@NC at 40 mA cm−2 is 1.68 V, which is smaller than that of RuO2 (1.70 V), indicating the excellent OER performance of FeNi@NC in high-concentration alkaline solution. This also further demonstrates the protective effect of carbon shell chainmail on catalytic activity in extremely alkaline catalytic environments. After testing the catalytic activity of the samples at different pyrolysis temperatures, the optimal synthesis temperature is determined to be 900 °C (Fig. S4). The metal mass loading normalized ORR and OER LSV results show that the mass catalytic activity of FeNi@NC is superior to that of commercial precious metal catalysts (Fig. S5). The superior bifunctional catalytic performance of FeNi@NC can be attributed to the synergistic effect between the highly active FeNi nanoparticles and the external carbon shells. This is further substantiated by subsequent DFT computations. Bao group demonstrated that encapsulated metal alloy nanoparticles are the core of chainmail catalysts and they are the origin of reactivity and the source of redistributed electrons [31]. According to the report by Lin group, transition metals typically have a relatively low electron function compared with precious metals, making them highly reactive in oxidizing or corrosive environments, but also susceptible to phase transition deactivation [32–34]. The carbon shells encapsulated around FeNi nanoparticles can effectively maintain the stability and durability of the active species that are prone to dissolution. As shown in Fig. S6, benefiting from the protective effect of the carbon shell like a “chainmail”, the LSV curves change slightly after 5000 cycles. As shown in Figs. S7(a) and S7(b), the SEM and TEM images of FeNi@NC show similar structure and morphology after the stability test, and FeNi nanoparticles distribute in the graphene-like carbon matrix. In Fig. S7(c), the HRTEM image clearly shows that the highly crystalline FeNi alloy is still surrounded by the carbon shell. As seen from the elemental mapping (Fig. S7(d)) of FeNi@NC, both Fe and Ni still distribute homogeneously in the FeNi alloy particle, confirming the favorable structural stability of FeNi@NC. 3.3 Computational insights From the above tests and analysis, the synergistic effects between the alloy and outer carbon shell contribute to the enhancement of electrocatalytic performance of alloy/carbon catalysts. Therefore, in-deep understanding about the specified roles of the synergistic effects played on catalytic mechanism was obtained by DFT computations. Four models corresponding to four synthesized catalysts are constructed based on experimental characterizations (Figs. S8–S11). The adsorption and desorption of oxygen-containing species/intermediates are important parts of ORR and OER. Electron transfer from metal alloys to carbon shells leads to rich electrons locating on the carbon shell, which can activate the surface of carbon shells and directly affect its adsorption behavior during catalysis, ultimately altering its catalytic activity and selectivity. The strong interactions between the metal/alloy nanoparticles and the carbon–based substrates can promote catalytic performance. According to Fig. 5(a) , in the OER process, the first step from H2O to *OH (where * refers to adsorption site) experienced on NC is difficult, while the rate-determining step for all metal@NC catalysts is the third elementary reaction (from *O to *OOH). The three metal@NC catalysts all show better OER activity than NC catalysts. Among the four catalysts, FeNi@NC shows minimum free energy change for rate-determining step, indicating the best OER activity, which is consistent with the electrochemical tests. When considering ORR process at 0 V vs. RHE (Fig. 5(b)), the first step on NC (from O2 to *OOH) proceed only acquiring energy. On the contrary, all steps conducted on three metal@NC catalysts are exothermic. The third step (from *O to *OH) is rate-determining step for Ni@NC (ΔG = 0.633 eV) and Fe3C@NC (ΔG = 0.709 eV), while the first step (from O2 to *OOH) is rate-determining step for FeNi@NC (ΔG = 0.773eV). FeNi@NC also exhibits the best ORR activity among the four catalysts. It can be concluded that the sites on NC are more active when encapsulating FeNi alloy compared with those on pure NC. Then the interactions between FeNi alloys and outer NC shells are further explored by computations. Obviously, the electrons of the alloy, especially Fe atoms, are transferred to the outer C and N atoms from Figs. 5(c) and S12, which leads to rich electrons locating on the carbon shell and the rich electrons can activate the surface of carbon shell [35–40]. Meanwhile, the work function (Fig. 5(d)) of FeNi@NC (3.858 eV) is lower than that of NC (4.936 eV), which is beneficial for the electron transfer, thus enhancing the electrocatalytic performance of FeNi@NC [41]. In addition, incorporating FeNi alloys significantly promotes the density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level (Fig. 5(e)), which reflects that the conductivity is improved since combining NC with FeNi alloys. High conductivity can also improve the electron transfer process in electrocatalytic reactions. In details, 3d orbitals of Fe and Ni atoms make contributions to the promotion of DOS near Fermi energy (Fig. 5(f)). According to previous reports [8,19,40], the doped nitrogen species change the electronic structure of the neighboring carbon sites, and graphitic N and pyrrolic N can provide electrons to the π-conjugated system. Thus, the introduction of graphite/pyrrolic N can increase the nucleophilicity of the neighboring carbons, which enhances the adsorption of O2 at these carbon sites, and therefore facilitates ORR [41]. Graphitic N species can also change the intrinsic properties of the material, thereby increasing the limiting current density and exhibiting better catalytic activity [19,42]. In addition, pyridinic N can accept electrons from neighboring carbon atoms, thus enhancing the adsorption of *OH, and *OOH at these carbon sites, which is favorable for OER. It is also postulated that pyridinic N can improve surface wettability, which is advantageous for electrochemical reaction processes [8,42]. Therefore, abundant N species of FeNi@NC are beneficial to enhance the oxygen catalytic activity. Accordingly, FeNi@NC inherently possess extraordinary ORR and OER activity, partially due to the combination between NC and FeNi alloys. The synergistic effect brings about rich and active electrons on the NC shell to join in electrocatalytic reactions quickly. According to the above exploration, the excellent bifunctional catalytic properties of FeNi@NC could be attributed to (1) the synergistic effect between highly active FeNi nanoparticles and the outer carbon shells, the electron transfer from FeNi alloy nanoparticles to the carbon shells can activate the surface of carbon and thus provide high catalytic activity; (2) the carbon shells encapsulated around FeNi nanoparticles can effectively maintain the stability and durability of the alloy species that are prone to dissolution; (3) N–doped graphene–like nanosheet substrates facilitate uniform distribution of metal alloy nanoparticles and provide high conductivity, and nitrogen dopants increase the electron density on the graphene surface, which is also conducive to improving the electrocatalytic activity. 3.4 Battery performance In view of the good ORR and OER performance, FeNi@NC catalysts are used as the cathode catalyst to assemble Zn-air batteries. Two Zn-air batteries connected in series can light up a small screen consisting of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which can operate continuously for 24 h (Fig. 6(a) ), demonstrating the practical usability of FeNi@NC catalysts. The charge-discharge polarization curves of the batteries based on FeNi@NC and Pt/C+RuO2 are shown in Fig. 6(b), and the battery based on FeNi@NC exhibits a lower charge-discharge voltage gap, indicating that the battery has superior rechargeability. In addition, the power density of battery based on FeNi@NC is 172 mW cm−2, which is superior to that of the batteries assembled with the Pt/C+RuO2 control sample (123 mW cm−2) (Fig. 6(c)). The batteries with FeNi@NC catalysts operate stably for 350 h at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with a flat charge-discharge voltage platform, and the charge-discharge voltage difference is 0.91 V and the efficiency is 53.1% at the 175th cycle (Fig. 6(d)). To further evaluate the durability of the catalyst, the batteries assembled with FeNi@NC or Pt/C+RuO2 catalysts were used for long–cycle tests at a current density of 5 mA cm−2 (Fig. 6(e)), and the battery with Pt/C+RuO2 catalyst operates for nearly 500 hours, while the battery with FeNi@NC as the catalyst can operate stably for 700 h with a flat charge-discharge voltage platform. At the 100th hour, the charge-discharge voltage difference was 0.80 V, and the efficiency was 58.1%. Until the 600th hour, the charge-discharge voltage difference and efficiency are slightly changed, which are 0.83 V and 57.8%, respectively. Zn-air batteries with FeNi@NC as cathodes outperform most of the reported advanced work (Table S2), especially in terms of stability and durability. Carbon shell chainmail provides critical protection for the catalyst from environmental damage in the harsh catalytic reaction environment inside Zn-air batteries, thus maintaining the full catalytic capacity, allowing the battery to output superior durability. The above results show that the Zn-air battery assembled with FeNi@NC bifunctional electrocatalyst has better cycle performance, power density and stability than the precious metal-based and reported advanced catalysts, which fully demonstrates the potential for applications of FeNi@NC. 4 Conclusions We successfully achieved the controlled growth of transition metal alloy within graphene-like nanosheets, coupled with the strategic introduction of nitrogen dopants. This straightforward synthesis method has yielded a remarkable chainmail catalyst, namely ultrathin carbon shell-encapsulated FeNi alloy nanoparticles supported on N-doped graphene-like nanosheets, referred to as FeNi@NC. The heart of our achievement lies in the synergistic interplay between the highly active FeNi nanoparticles and the protective carbon shells. This synergy is pivotal for achieving efficient bifunctional catalytic activity. FeNi@NC demonstrates exceptional performance in catalyzing both ORR and OER in alkaline environments. When integrated into Zn-air batteries, FeNi@NC allows for stable and sustained operation at high power densities, ensuring an extended lifespan. Moreover, the carbon shells enveloping the FeNi nanoparticles play a dual role by effectively maintaining the distribution and stability of active species that are prone to dissolution and facilitating the rapid transport of ions and electrons at the interface. Computations further substantiate our work, demonstrating that electron transfer from FeNi alloy nanoparticles to the carbon shells activates the carbon surface, resulting in enhanced catalytic activity. In a broader context, our research illuminates the rational design and synthesis of heteroatom-doped carbon materials that support the controlled growth of transition metal alloys and protect the alloy nanoparticles. The exceptional performance of FeNi@NC offers a practical and promising solution for achieving high-efficiency Zn-air batteries, with far-reaching implications for energy storage and sustainability.

        "dc:description": "The sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) pose significant challenges for the viability of rechargeable Zn-air batteries. Developing efficient, cost-effective, stable, and dual-purpose oxygen electrocatalysts remains a formidable hurdle. In this study, we successfully synthesized a highly promising chainmail catalyst named FeNi@NC, comprising ultrathin carbon shells encapsulating FeNi alloy nanoparticles on N-doped graphene-like nanosheets. The strong synergistic effects between FeNi alloys and N-doped carbon shells result in outstanding bifunctional catalytic activity, particularly in alkaline media. Consequently, Zn-air batteries incorporating FeNi@NC as the catalyst demonstrate exceptional performance, operating reliably at high power density with extended lifespan. Furthermore, computational analyses provided further confirmation of the catalytic activity and revealed that the electron transfer from FeNi alloy nanoparticles to the carbon shells activates the carbon surface, leading to enhanced catalytic performance. This research not only sheds light on the rational design and synthesis of heteroatom-doped carbon materials supporting the growth-constrained transition metal alloys but also offers a practical solution for advancing the application of Zn-air batteries.",
