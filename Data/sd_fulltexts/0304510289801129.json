SIMARD, A. ADNOT and S. KALIAGUINE Department of Chemical Engineering and GRAPS, Uniuersite Laval, Ste-Foy, Que. (Canada) (Received March 9, 1988; accepted September 5, 1988) Summary This paper reports an investigation of Fe Pd/ZSM-5 catalysts prepared by two different techniques, both using ferrocene and palladium allylcycio- pentadienyl as sources of iron and palladium respectively. These catalysts are used for deoxygenation of organic compounds in the presence of CO. They were characterized using XRD, quantitative IR of adsorbed pyridine and quantitative ESCA (electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis). Cata- lytic tests including CO hydrogenation and methanol conversion in carbon monoxide are reported and discussed. Introduction In the present communication, we wish to complete and further discuss work reported recently [1] on the development of a suitable catalyst for deoxygenation of organic materials in the presence of a CO-rich gas. In the previous work, the catalyst Fe Pd/ZSM-5 demonstrated a good capacity to transform methanol to high quality hydrocarbon products in the presence of CO, while making optimal use of the hydrogen in CH30H. Hence, a detailed investigation was carried out here to characterize this bimetallic catalyst using X-ray diffraction, IR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine and ESCA. The model of ESCA intensity ratio analysis developed by Kaliaguine et al. [2] for supported catalysts with surface segregation is applied here for the first time to bimetallic supported catalysts. The changes in dispersion of the iron- and palladium-containing phases, both with the method of preparation and following a Fischer-Tropsch test, were monitored using this quantitative treatment of ESCA data. Experimental Catalyst preparation Two series of catalysts were prepared using two different techniques for deposition of the organometallic compound used as the metal source. The 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 82 first series (including sample 107) was prepared by the so-called calcination technique [1]. In this case the activated H-ZSM-5 is soaked in a solution of ferrocene and palladium allylcyclopentadienyl in an appropriate solvent (n-pentane in the case of sample 107), sonicated for 30 min at room temper- ature, and the solvent evaporated to dryness. Then the dry residue is calcined in air at 550 C. The second series, which includes samples 149 A, B and C, was prepared by another technique, designated as gas phase adsorption, in which the zeolite and the two organometallic compounds are ground together in a mortar, introduced in a pyrex tube which is evacuated, sealed and slowly heated to a temperature higher than the decomposition tempera- ture of the complexes. This temperature, which in this particular case was 300 C, is maintained for 24 h. The recovered material is placed in a crucible and calcined in air at 500 C. Table 1 presents for each catalyst studied the composition, preparation method and characteristics of the support. Iron and palladium bulk contents expressed in metal wt.% were determined by atomic absorption.

Spectra were recorded using Cu Ka ray excitation. XRD was performed to establish the presence of a population of oxide crystallites located on the outer surface of the ZSM-5 particles. From the width of the XRD lines, an average particle size is calculated for this population using the Debye- Sherrer equation [3]. Infrared analysis of adsorbed pyridine allows determination of the level of substitution of protonic acid sites in ZSM-5 by metal cations. Spectra were obtained and treated following a procedure described by Stencel et al. [4]. 83 Oxidation states and dispersion were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ESCA). Spectra were acquired on a VG Escalab Mark II elec- tron spectrometer equipped with an hemispherical electrostatic analyzer. Samples were mounted on indium foils and analyzed in the constant-pass energy mode (20 eV), using an incident beam of Al Ka X-rays. Pressure in the chamber during spectral acquisition was less than 10~6 Pa. All binding energies were corrected for charging by referencing the binding energy scale to Sizp at 103.3 eV. Catalyst evaluation Two catalytic tests were performed on selected catalysts. A syngas conversion test was carried out at temperatures up to 400 C with a CO/H^ ratio of 1. This test was conducted in order to verify that high CO hydro- genation activities were maintained at the higher temperatures necessary to conduct MTG reactions in optimal conditions. Then a test of the reaction of methanol with CO at 400 C was performed as a model reaction for the deoxygenation in a CO atmosphere. These two tests were carried out in a microcatalytic fixed bed reactor, made of a SS tube (38 cm X 6 mm i. d.), where 1 g of catalyst is placed between two plugs of glass wool. The experi- mental setup as well as the details of the chromatographic procedure used for analysis of the products are described in [1, 5, 6]. Results and discussion XRD spectra of all calcined catalyst samples were recorded and the interpretation of these patterns is summarized in Table 1. The assignments of the phases present are made by comparing the XRD spectra of the catalysts with that of the support. This shows only the presence of PdO particles (20 = 33.7 ) with average size of 80 -100 A on all samples but sample 149C, which contains less than 1% Pd. The absence of lines for a given phase in an XRD spectrum may not necessarily mean the absence of this phase in the sample. In that case, the phase may be present with a particle size below 50 A or at a bulk concen- tration below the XRD limit of detection. Table 2 shows the results of IR spectra of chemisorbed pyridine. The observed complete disappearance of the 3610 cm\"1 line upon pyridine adsorption was accepted as a proof that all Bronstedacid sites in the ZSM-5 pore lattice were actually reached by pyridine. Bronsted (B) and Lewis (L) acid site concentrations and degrees of ion exchange have been quantita- tively determined. In these catalysts, as the valence state of the cations has not been unambiguously determined, we have assumed that cations are in the +2 oxidation state, as with Fe/ZSM-5 [6] and Pd/ZSM-5 [1]. It was also assumed that the relative Fe24\" and Pd2\"1\" degrees of exchange are in propor- tion to the relative bulk contents of Fe and Pd in each sample. The total content of M2\"*\" cations per unit cell was calculated from the experimental 84 TABLE 2 IR results of adsorbed pyridine Sample Wt.% designation metal ^B \"L AB/AL M^/unitcell B/unit cell Wt.% metal (cm~1) (cm\"1) exchanged 107 1.93% Fe 1530 1445 0.294 0.49 0.62 0.25 3.45% Pd 0.44 149A 0.92% Fe 1532 1443 0.323 0.35 0.62 0.10 3.57% Pd 0.39 149B 1.83% Fe 1530 1445 0.126 0.46 0.41 0.23 3.19% Pd 0.41 149C 3.65% Fe 1532 1448 0.217 0.43 0.47 0.49 0.83% Pd 0.11 values for the absorbance ratio (AB/AL) for the 1540 and 1450 cm ' lines of the catalyst and its support zeolite: B, - L,(eL/CB)(AB/AL) (1) 2(eL/(?B)(AB/AL) + 2 From the same data, estimates can also be calculated for the number of Bronsted acid sites per unit cell for the support (B^) and the catalysts (B): 2B, = (eL/eBXAB/AJ. (2) n D- B = B, - 2M2-1- (3) where n is the number of aluminum atoms per unit cell. From Table 2 it can be seen that sample 107 has the same number of Bronsted acid sites as 149A and cationic concentrations closer to those of sample 149B. ESCA spectra of the calcined Fe Pd/ZSM-5 catalysts in the Feap and Pd^ regions are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. At higher Fe contents (sample 149C), the 2p3/2 and 2p,/2 binding energies (711.2 and 724.1 eV), as well as the position of a small satellite are characteristic of Fe(III) in FejOy [6]. As iron concentration decreases, the position of the satellite shifts slightly downward, whereas the 2p3/2 peak shifts upward by 0.6 eV. This behaviour is identical to that observed in the Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst [7], and was explained by the appearance at low Fe content of a contribution of fully ionized Fe2\"1\" cations. The binding energies of Pd^ lines (337.1 0.2 eV) in the spectra of all the calcined catalysts are characteristic of Pd(II) in PdO [5].

The (Pd/Si)EscA values seem closer to the 87 bulk value, but this cannot be interpreted as indicating a uniform dispersion of Pd throughout the particle, as XRD data gave evidence for the existence of PdO crystallites with sizes 80 -100 A. Such crystallites cannot be accom- modated within the pores and must therefore be surface-segregated. This illustrates the necessity to use a model for the supported catalyst, taking into consideration the simultaneous influence of surface segregation and disper- sion in the quantitative treatment of ESCA intensity data. We have recently proposed such a model [2], which represents ESCA intensity ratios as: m =(K^}[(l-P^ l}|(l-P^-l] (5) V-'s/ESCA where p stands for the supported phase (the promoter) and s for the support. K is an explicit constant, whereas Pi, P; and ?3 are probabilities for the photoelectrons to cross various regions of the supported catalyst, defined in the model [2]. These probabilities are functions of the following adjustable parameters: Ci, c;: sizes of the crystallites of the supported phase located in the pores and on the external surface of the support respectively; x^, x^: the wt.% of these two populations of crystallites, related by: ;)Cl+;X:2=.X:B (6) where Xy is the bulk loading of the supported element, measured indepen- dently. In the calculation reported in the present paper, Ci was arbitrarily fixed at 3 A, and Xi was calculated from the IR spectrum of adsorbed pyridine as: %H^ ^-^ '\"'(^H.^ <7' where in each case the reference sample was the one with the smallest con- tent of the element under consideration (149A for Fe and 149C for Pd) and ( \"^ref was arbitrarily set at 50% of (;x:B)ref- With these assumptions, eqn. (5) can be solved for c^; the results are reported in Tables 3 and 4 for the calcined catalysts. Obviously the two methods of preparation lead to different structures for the dispersion of the oxide phases. Sample 107 should be compared to sample 149B of compara- ble metal content. The results for c^ in Tables 3 and 4 show that in 107 the PdO particles are two times smaller than the Fe;;03 crystallites, whereas the reverse situation is observed in sample 149B. A comparison between samples 149A, B and C shows that the PdO crystallite size decreases from 212 to 117 A when the Pd content decreases. Simultaneously, the Fe203 crystallite size diminishes from 134 to 73 A, as the Fe content increases from 0.92 to 3.65%. This last result is quite unexpected, and suggests that both elements Fe and Pd are present in the same crystallites, whose the dimensions are imposed by the palladium oxide geometry. Actually the values of the ratio (capa/c^pe) a^e wy close for the 88 three catalysts 149A, B and C 1.58,1.64 and 1.60 respectively. This must be related to the fact that only the PdO oxidic phase is observed, in addition to the support, in the XRD diagrams of these catalysts. Such a bimetallic oxidic phase might be the precursor for the generation of bimetallic clusters. Garten [8], for example, has shown by Mossbauer spectroscopy that binary clusters of Fe Pd can be obtained on A^Oa supports. ESCA spectra were also recorded for the two catalysts 107 and 149B cooled under helium gas after a Fischer-Tropsch test conducted at 400 C. The binding energies and line intensity ratios observed are reported in Tables 5 and 6, which give also the values of c; obtained by solving eqn. (5). The well-resolved Pd^ lines with a Pd^ 3/2 binding energy value at 335.3 eV indi- cate that Pd is in the metallic state in both samples. The Fe^p lines presented in Fig. 4 indicate that in both catalysts the iron is only partially reduced to Fe(0). In spite of these results, the values for the parameters of the sup- ported phase used to calculate the values of c; reported in Tables 5 and 6 were those of the metal in both cases; in particular, pp-e = 7.86 g cm\"3 and ppa = 11.97 gem-3. On comparing the values of c; after calcination (Tables 3 and 4) and after reduction and Fischer-Tropsch reaction (Tables 5 and 6), it can be seen that the dispersion changes in samples 107 and 149B are completely differ- ent. In sample 107, both Pd and Fe phases diminish their crystallite size upon reduction, from 153 to 55 A for iron and from 70 to 58 A for palla- dium. In the case of sample 149B, all results for Cz indicate an increase in TABLE 5 ESCA data and calculated results for the Fez? line of Fe Pd/ZSM-5 catalysts after a Fischer-Tropsch test Sample ^charge Ois Fe2p 3/2 W/Si ^B l!

These changes in dispersion suggest that the two methods of prepara- tion yield very different supported materials. In the case of sample 107 prepared by the calcination technique, the supported materials display a moderate decrease in size upon reduction. This suggests that each crystallite shrinks without interaction with neighbouring crystallites, which implies that each crystallite is isolated and fixed to the surface of the support. With sample 149B, prepared by the gas phase adsorption technique, as the particles grow in size during reduction, it seems that both metals can migrate which suggests mass transfer between crystallites during reduction or Fischer-Tropsch (F.T.) test. Such a behaviour should correspond to a decrease in F.T. activity with reduction time and time on stream. It is inter- esting to note that Garten, in the work already cited [8], also found a signif- icant agglomeration of bimetallic FePd clusters supported on 77 + A^Oa upon heating in hydrogen at temperatures successively increasing from 673 to 973 K. These results illustrate the interest of the quantitative approach used here for the treatment of ESCA data, which allows monitoring of the changes in dispersion of a supported phase during any chemical transformation. Table 7 shows experimental results obtained in Fischer-Tropsch tests with samples 107, 149A and 149B and with monometallic catalysts G-55 and G-155B. These results show that at 400 C catalyst 107 has F.T. activity com- parable to that of 149A, although, as shown in Figs. 6 and 7, the first yields, 300 350 Temp. ( C) Fig. 5.

At the same temperature, 107 is much more active than 149B, yielding a CO + H; conversion of 64.4% compared to 37.4%. For these two catalysts, Tables 5 and 6 report the values for Si and S; which are the surface areas of the metallic phase per gram of catalyst, calculated for the crystallites located in the pores and outside the support particles respectively. These values were calculated from the ESCA data using eqn. (8): 5x, S, = (8) pc, where p is the density of the metallic phase. These calculations suggest comparable values for S, + S; of both Fe and Pd in the two catalysts. They show also that most of the metallic surface is associated with the smaller particles within the pores. The consequence is that the estimations of these surfaces may be in large error, as only 03, and not Ci, is determined with some precision from the ESCA data. The funda- mental reason for this is that all atoms in particles smaller than the escape depths have a high photoelectron escape probability, so that the effect of particle size on ESCA intensity is not very significant for particles below 10 A. This may explain the lack of correlation between the observed F.T. activities and the estimations of surface Si + S;. Another possible explana- tion is that in the case of sample 149B Fe and Pd are associated in the same crystallites, whereas in sample 107 the two metals are present in separate phases, as suggested in the previous discussion. In these conditions, the lower F.T. activity observed for 149B would correspond to a lower catalytic activity of the mixed Fe + Pd phase. Table 8 shows some data for the conversion of methanol in the pres- ence of CO at 400 C. In such systems several reactions are produced simulta- neously. First, in the presence of metallic functions methanol can be decomposed to CO and H2. This reaction is detected by the presence in the products of more H; than is produced by water-gas shift. The corresponding stoichio metric amount of CO is calculated and considered as a product. Methanol to gasoline (MTG) reactions on the Bronsted acid sites of the zeolite consume all the remaining methanol, yielding approximately 56% TABLE 8A Results of MeOH + CO tests for G-134, G-117, G-158 and 107 catalysts at 400 C Exp.

From the amount of CO; formed, one can calculate the amount of water converted (HaOweg) so that a percentage of water-gas shift conversion is obtained. Important departures from the 56/44 distribution of (H^Oexp + H^OwGsVhydrocarbons indicate that additional amounts of tl^O, CO; or hydrocarbons are produced, possibly by reaction with CO of the hydrogen generated by methanol decomposition and water-gas shift. Such a case is obtained with catalyst 107. In this case the percentage of the total hydrogen introduced as CH30H in the feed, which is recovered in the hydrocarbon fraction of the products, is much higher than the 50% value obtained when MTG is the only reaction to take place. The role of Pd is to dissociate hydro- gen and accelerate the hydrogenation of CO by spillover of atomic hydrogen. In Table 8 it can be seen that with catalyst 149A submitted to various reducing pretreatments and with sample 149C the amount of H in hydro- carbons remains very close to 50%. This suggests a lower ability of Pd to dissociate hydrogen on samples prepared by vapor adsorption. Possible explanations for this would be an association of the Pd with Fe, either with iron covering the Pd surface or by any other effect of alloying. It is interest- ing to note that, as discussed above, the quantitative analysis of ESCA inten- sity ratios suggests that bimetallic crystallites containing both Fe and Pd exist already on the calcined form of the corresponding catalysts. Conclusion The present work shows that the quantitative use of ESCA intensity ratios, although not yet fully developed, has interesting potential applica- tions in the characterization of supported catalysts having quite complex structural features, such as those of bimetallic catalysts deposited on zeolites. Some information can be gained on the size of the various sup- ported phases and on the possible association of the two metals in these phases. It is especially noteworthy that by using ESCA these features can be examined whatever the chemical environment of the metallic elements under consideration, as demonstrated here with the calcined and reduced forms of the examined catalysts.
