Short communication Amberlyst-15: A mild, efficient and reusable heterogeneous catalyst for Michael addition of pyrroles to α,β-unsaturated ketones Biswanath Das ⁎ Kongara Damodar Nikhil Chowdhury Organic Chemistry Division-I, Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, Hyderabad 500007, India ⁎ Corresponding author. Tel.: +91 40 27160512; fax: +91 40 27160512. A general procedure for the Michael addition of pyrroles with α,β-unsaturated ketones using catalytic amount of Amberlyst-15 at room temperature has been developed. This method is fast, efficient, high yielding and eco-friendly to afford the corresponding Michael adducts generally in good to excellent yields without polymerization. Graphical abstract Keywords Amberlyst-15 Pyrrole α,β-Unsaturated ketone Michael reaction Heterogeneous reusable catalyst Pyrrole and C-alkylated pyrroles are important building blocks in various biologically active molecules, such as chlorophyll, porphyrin, hemoglobin, Vitamin B12, indigo and bile pigment [1]. The synthesis and reactions of pyrroles have thus attracted much attention over a century. Among pyrroles, 2-alkyl or 2-acyl pyrroles are versatile synthons for the synthesis of a wide range of pyrrole derivatives [2]. The indirect routes affording C-alkyl pyrroles involve the Wolf–Kishner reduction of 2-formyl or 2-acyl pyrroles [3], the application of pyrrolyl magnesium halides [4] and isomerization of N-alkyl pyrroles by thermal rearrangement at high temperature, resulting in 2- and 3-alkyl pyrroles [5]. However, these indirect methods are associated with the disadvantages of multistep reactions and of polymerization under most reaction conditions. A direct useful method for C-alkylation of pyrroles is the Friedel–Crafts type conjugate addition to α,β-unsaturated ketones. The direct synthesis of 2-alkylated pyrroles still remains a challenge for the synthetic chemists because of their sensitivity to air and acids which lead to polymerization [6]. The Lewis acids, InCl3 [7], Bi(NO3)3 [8], Yb(OTf)3 [9], CuBr2 [10] and metal triflate [11] have recently been reported as catalysts for this reaction. A microwave-assisted method have also been used for alkylation of pyrroles [12]. As a part of our continuing effort towards the development of useful synthetic methodologies [13] with the application of Amberlyst-15, we recently observed that it can catalyze the Michael addition of pyrroles to α,β-unsaturated ketones (Scheme 1 ). The reaction was initially attempted for catalytical evolution of Amberlyst-15 for conjugate addition of pyrrole with methyl vinyl ketone using equimolar ratio (entry a, Table 2). The conversion was complete within 6min when 10% (w/w) of Amberlyst-15 was used in CH3CN at room temperature. 2-Alkyl pyrrole, 3a and 2,5-dialkyl pyrrole, 4a, were obtained in a ratio of 1:3 in 91% yield (Scheme 1 and Table 2). The reaction was attempted with different solvents (Table 1 ) and the yield was found to be better in CH3CN. Further increment of the amount of Amberlyst-15 did not enhance the yield of the products. No products were obtained when the reaction was conducted in absence of this catalyst. Subsequently, different other α,β-unsaturated ketones (2b–2e) were reacted with pyrrole at room temperature to give the corresponding 2-alkyl and 2,5-dialkyl pyrroles in various ratios and in 65–91% combined yields (Scheme 1 and Table 2 ). N-Methyl and N-benzoyl pyrroles were also applied for alkylation by the present method. N-Benzoyl pyrrole afforded only monoalkylated products in somewhat low yields (entry k and l, Table 2) due to low electron density on the ring carbon. Dialkylated pyrroles were obtained exclusively by increasing the amount of the ketones. Thus, reaction of pyrroles with excess α,β-unsaturated ketones (1:3) in the presence of 10% (w/w) Amberlyst-15 in CH3CN afforded only 2,5-dialkylated pyrroles in 65–89% yield within short reaction time at room temperature (Table 3 ). The catalyst, Amberlyst-15, is commercially available, inexpensive and non-hazardous. It works under heterogeous conditions and can easily be handled and removed by simple filtration. The recovered catalyst was recycled consecutively three times to produce the desired products with little variation of their yields. In summary, Amberlyst-15 has been demonstrated here as an efficient catalyst for the C-alkylation of pyrroles with α,β-unsaturated ketones. The mildness, simple experimental procedures, short reaction times, impressive yields and reusability of catalyst are the advantages of the present protocol. 1 Experimental 1.1 Typical experimental procedure To a mixture of pyrrole (1mmol) and α,β-unsaturated ketone (1 or 3mmol) in CH3CN (5mL) Amberlyst-15 (10%, w/w) was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for the appropriate time (Tables 2 and 3). The reaction was followed by TLC. After completion of the reaction, the catalyst was separated by filtration. The solvent was evaporated from the filtrate by reduced pressure and the residue was subjected to column chromatography (silica gel, hexane–EtOAc) to obtain pure products. The recovered catalyst was reused for consecutive three times to form the products with a little variation of their yields.
