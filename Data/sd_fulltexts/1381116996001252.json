Rouisco Pais, 1096 Lisboa Codex, Portugal Received 2 October 1995: accepted 29 February 1996 Abstract The effect of doping N'M004 with increasing Cs concentrations (1, 3 and 6%), on the crystalline structure, chemical nature and catalytic behaviour for the oxidative dehydrogenation of butane, was studied. The atomic ratio Mo/Ni = 1 and the cesium concentration were checked by several techniques (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic absorption, inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy). The structural study of the a- and -phases was carried out by high temperature X-ray diffraction and showed that Cs does not affect the molybdate structure at room temperature. However it makes the transition from a- to phase by heating difficult. Cs remains on the catalyst surface blocking pores and reducing BET surface area. The acid and basic natures of the catalysts were studied by NH, and CO, temperature programmed desorption, respectively. The formation of nitrogenated compounds during the NH3-TPD was observed. C02-TPD shows an increase in the catalyst basicity with Cs doping, but overdoping was observed for the 6% Cs-NiMo04 catalyst. The catalytic tests showed a decrease of activity with the Cs content. In both the a- and phases the selectivity to dehydrogenation products increases with the Cs contents, but tends to decrease for the 6% Cs-NiMo04, due to the overdoping effect. This effect in the a-phase and the j3-phase stabilisation in the catalyst with higher Cs contents, contributes to an increase of the activity normalised to surface area.

Introduction It is well known that NiMo04 may have three different structures, but, only two of them are stable at atmospheric pressure [1].

All rights reserved. PIIS1381-1169(9000125-2 shows a octahedral coordination of Mo ( aphase) at room temperature. It is stabilised in tetrahedral coordination (phase) at high temperature and cannot be quenched to ambient temperature. The catalytic activity of both phases was studied by several researchers. However, while Itenberg [2] found that both phases present similar activity and selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane into butadiene, it is generally accepted [1,3] that the a-phase is more 314 F.J. Maldonado-Har et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical Ill (1996) 313-323 active and the phase is more selective for this kind of alkane reactions. New preparation methods using organic salts have recently been tested in order to induce a greater stabilization of (3-phase at room temperature [4] for obtaining better selectivities and to avoid the continuous heating required to maintain the catalyst in its configuration. The catalytic behaviour of the NiMo04 is not only influenced by the crystalline structure. The chemical nature of catalyst surface (acidity/basicity) also influences the activity and product distribution with oxide-based catalysts [5,6]. On the other hand, alkali metals used as promoters also affect the activity and selectivity of the catalyst according to the nature of the promoter ion [3,7]. No papers were found concerning the effect of alkaline cations on physicochemical properties of the Ni-Mo-O system. However, a few papers studied these aspects for other catalytic systems, such as V205-Ti02 [8,9] or M003-Ti02 [10-12], including active ones for the dehydrogenation of alkanes [13]. It is therefore of great interest to study the structural and chemical aspects of NiMo04 not yet clarified, the changes that the cesium deposition causes in them, as well as the relationship between the chemical and physical properties and the activity/ selectivity of these catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of butane. 2. Experimental An unsupported a-NiMo04 catalyst was prepared by coprecipitation reaction according the method described by Mazzocchia et al. [14] with a Mo/Ni atomic ratio of 1. Cesium doped catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation of the a-NiMo04 over about 15 h at 60, using cesium nitrate; the liquid to solid ratio was 10 by weight. The impregnated sample was filtered and dried at 120 for 4 h and finally calcined in air for 2 h at 550. The characterization of the prepared catalysts was carried out by Inductively Coupled Plasma Spectroscopy (ICP), Atomic Absorption (AA), XRD, IR and XPS. Experimental details can be found elsewhere [3]. All the catalysts had an atomic ratio Mo/Ni = 1 and a cesium surface concentration of 1, 3 and 6%. The surface areas of all catalysts were determined by the nitrogen BET method. An attempt was made to estimate the surface areas of 0phase catalysts by quenching them after the thermal treatment required to produce the hase, although this phase cannot be completely stabilized at room temperature as shown by the XRD experiments. The structural study of both a- and phases was carried out by XRD in a Rigaku apparatus using the Cu Ka radiation (Ni filter) from 10 to 50 at 2min. The spectra were recorded at 21 for the a-phase. The activation to phase was made in situ with air flow, heating the sample at 20/min up to 710 and maintaining this temperature for 10 min before recording the spectrum [ 1 ]. The acidity/basicity of the catalyst's surface was studied by NH3 and COZ TPD, respectively. The NH 3-TPD experiments were performed only for some samples adsorbing NH 3 at 30 because formation of nitrogenated compounds was observed. The C02-TPD experiments were carried out adsorbing COZ at 30 and 250. The catalyst was pretreated by heating the sample in He flow up to 550 to clean the surface, but avoiding the transition to phase. One previous experiment carried out in He flow up to 650 showed that between 550 and 650 the detector signal is negligible. In both cases about 0.3 g of the catalysts were saturated in NH3 or COZ at the corresponding temperature and then desorbed by heating at 10/min in a He flow of 1 cm3/s, with on-line gas analysis performed with the TC detector of a Shimadzu GC-8A gas chromatograph. The catalytic experiments were carried out in a fixed-bed, continuous flow tubular quartz reactor (I.D. 20 mm; length 600 mm) with a F.J. Maldonado-Har et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical H1 (1996) 313-323 coaxially centered thermocouple. The catalyst charge was 0.3 g mixed with quartz in a volume ratio of 1:2 catalyst to quartz. This catalyst charge was chosen for always having differential conversions. All the experiments were performed at atmospheric pressure. The feed was a mixture of butane, oxygen and nitrogen with molar ratio of 4/9/87 and the contact time was equivalent to W/F = 12 g - h/molbutane. The catalytic tests were performed between 375 and 575 for a-phase and 425-600 for (3-phase. The phase catalysts were formed in situ by heating a-phase catalysts at 710 in air flow for 10 min, and then cooling to the predetermined temperature. The stability of the phase was checked throughout the temperature range used. Blank runs proved that under the experimental conditions used the homogeneous reactions can be neglected. Analyses of reactants and products were carried out by an on-line Shimadzu GC-8A gas chromatograph with two columns: (i) molecular sieve 13X (60-80 mesh, 2 m X 1 /8 in. stainless steel); (ii) 33% dimethylsulpholane on Chromosorb P (60-80 mesh, 6 m X 1/8 in.). NiMo0, 315 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Catalyst characterization AA, ICP and XPS measurements confirmed an atomic ratio Mo/Ni = 1 (stoichiometric NiMo04) and only traces of alkali metal were detected in the bulk of the catalysts. XPS evidenced that the surface cesium concentration is in agreement with the expected dopage: 1, 3 and 6% (Table 1). In addition, the binding energies of MOM XPS spectra becomes lower in the doped catalysts, which suggests an increase of the average electron density [3]. The unpromoted NiMo04 and the Cs doped catalysts were structurally studied at room temperature (21) by XRD (Fig. 1). The amolybdate showed only the peaks of the a-phase (ASTM - 33-948). The results show that doping with Cs does not produce apparent changes in the molybdate structure, independently of the alkali concentration. Cs remains only on the catalyst surface and does not produce segregation of NiO or M003. However, the Cs doping produces blockage of the NiMo04 pores leading to smaller surface areas when the Cs concentra- 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 ze 6% Cs - NIMOOd 1 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 ze Fig. 1.

Other important cx-phase peaks (ASTM - 33-948) are even negligible (14.0 43.7and 47.5 at 710. However, whereas the presence of Cs does not affect the catalyst structure in the a-phase, significant differences are observed in the a - transition. In fact the a - transition is inhibited by the presence of cesium in the doped catalysts. A mixture of both phases is observed in all the cases, and the a-peaks, weak in the unpromoted catalyst, are again easily identified even with the lower Cs contents. The alpha/beta ratio can be determined by the intensity ratio of the txphase characteristic peak with respect to the corresponding one of phase. It follows the sequence: unpromoted < 1% Cs < 3% Cs = 6% Cs. In the case of 3 and 6% Cs doped NiM004, the phase transition is only ca. 50%. The catalysts surface was characterized by NH3 and CO2 TPD in order to investigate their acid-basic nature. The data obtained are showed in Fig. 3. In the NH3-TPD profile (Fig. 3A), the detector response shows a maximum at about 100 and decreases quickly at the beginning and more slowly between 200-400. A second less important maximum appears at around 600. These results suggest that besides physical NH, adsorption, the catalyst surface also exhibits a certain acidity, possibly involving two main types of sites. However, after this experiment, a change in the sample colour was observed. The 317 original light green yellow is transformed into blue-purple. This fact suggests the possible formation of nitrogenated compounds which were also observed by Verhaak [15] in other Ni supported catalyst during NH3-TPD experiment. Consequently, the acidity estimation by this method could be altered by this reaction and, probably, a less basic adsorbate (e.g. pyridine) must be used. The C02-TPD experiment for a-phase, with adsorption at 30 (Fig. 3B) shows that the physisorption of COZ is negligible (important detector response was not observed below 100) and two types of sites with different 7ooo 8000 5000 4000 3000 2000 1000 - A j n t . - - - - 3% Cs - NiMO 0 100 8000 - 5000 3000 zooo 4000 1000 3500 3000 zsoo 2000 7500 l~ tooo soo 200 300 400 Temperature ( ) 500 800 NiMo04 ------ t% Cs -NiMo04 3% Cs - NiMo04 -8% Cs - NiMo04 i kl 0 o too DI o too 200 300 400 Temperature ( ) soo soo ~ NiMo04 ------1% Cs-NiMo04 200 300 400 500 800 Temperature ( ) Fig. 3.

Maldo-Har et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 111 (1996) 313-323 basic strengths are in evidence. The cesium doping causes an increase in the catalyst basicity with respect to the unpromoted N'M004 (visible by the increase in the first peak area) as would be expected according to the electron donor nature of Cs. The peaks tend to appear at higher temperatures with stronger basicity of the surface sites. In our case, the position of the first maximum is progressively displaced to lower temperatures when the alkali contents increases, i.e., the doped catalysts exhibit more sites than the pure N'M004, but these new sites are less basic. With respect to the second type, we cannot draw a clear conclusion, partly because the maximum position was never exactly determined since the experiments were performed only up to 650 to avoid the possible a --> transition. However, in general, they seem to be displaced to higher temperatures. It is also noteworthy that although the area of the first peak increases with respect to the unpromoted NiMo04 for all the doped samples, this a - 6 CS - NiMoO, (21 ) Ir _jjj~' i nm~. . . . 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Ir 1, 20 a - 6 % Cs - NiMo04 (625 ) A A A __ ' 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 20 - NiMoO, (710 ) 10 15 20 25 30 20 - NiMoO(425 ) Ir 35 40 45 50 ,-i I_JW ~ A A ~.

In order to eliminate the possible effect of physically adsorbed CO2, the CO2 adsorption was also carried out at 250. The TPD profiles for the unpromoted and 1 % Cs doped samples are illustrated in Fig. 3C. A similar increase of basicity is observed although the maxima are logically displaced. 3.2. Catalytic behaviour The stability of both phases in the temperature range used for catalytic experiments was also confirmed by HTXRD (Fig. 4). It is noteworthy that only dehydrogenation products from butane (C4's) and carbon oxides (CO and CO2) were detected under all experimental conditions. Higher conversions are obtained with a-phase at the same temperature, which agrees with 1.0E-02 8.0E-03 - 8.0E-03 - 4.0E-03 - 1.8E-02 - 1.2E-02 8.0E-03 - 4.0E-03 I 0.0E+00 phase a-phase -f- NiMo04 -w-1 1% Cs - NIM004 -a 3% Cs - NiMO04 - n- 6% Cs- NiMo04 2.0E-03 o.oE+oo 350 400 450 500 550 B00 Temperature ( ) 400 450 -i - NiMo+-1 % Cs - NiMo04 --a- 3% Cs - NiMo04 -*- 8% Cs - NiMo04 r 500 550 p 800 850 Temperature ( ) Fig. 5.

Dependence of the activation energies on cesium contents for a- and phases. previous studies [1,3]. In general activity decreases for both phases according to the sequence: unpromoted > 1% Cs > 3% Cs > 6% Cs. In Fig. 5 are depicted the rates of butane conversion at different temperatures. For the experimental conditions used, with conversions low enough to allow computation of reaction rates (r) by the initial rate approach, the representation of In r versus 1 /T for each product shows a linear behaviour with correlation coefficients (RZ) always higher than 0.98. The dependence of the apparent activation energies ( Ea) for each product on the cesium contents is presented in Fig. 6. In general, Ea increases for both phases with the Cs doping, leading to activity decrease as mentioned above. It is also important to point out that specially for a-phase, such increase is significantly higher for CO and COZ than for C4's up to 3% cesium 320 F.J. Maldonado-Har et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical Ill (1996) 313-323 contents. However, for a-phase, above such dopant concentration, it is observed a decrease in the activation energies for both carbon oxides, being more significant in the case of CO2. In both phases the selectivity increases for 1-butane and 2-butanes up to 3% Cs and after a small decrease is observed for 6% Cs-N'M004. Butadiene selectivity only shows a certain improvement for 1 % Cs-(x-N'M004, decreasing for both phases with the Cs contents in such a manner that becomes negligible at lower temperatures. The selectivity for both carbon oxides decreases with respect to the unpromoted catalyst at low cesium concentration (up to 3% for a-phase and up to 1 % for phase) but increasing for CO2 with the 6% Cs-NiMo04 to the level of the unpromoted catalyst (Fig. 7). When the selectivity to C4's is plotted versus the cesium contents at constant conversion (Fig. 7), both phases present an increase for the 1 % doped catalyst with respect to the unpromoted NiMo04. This effect is more important for aphase, although the selectivity does not increase 30 20 10 0 ~- significantly after for the 3% Cs-N'M004. Maxima of selectivity are observed at about 3% Cs for a-phase and 1 % Cs for (3-phase with well visible decreases at 6% Cs doping. In Fig. 8 are presented the C4's yields vs. the butane conversion for the promoted and unpromoted catalysts. At identical conversions a significant yield improvement is obtained for ocphase with all the promoted catalysts. However, these improvements are less for the 6% CsNiMo04 catalyst. With (3-phase such behaviour is not so evident and only the 1% Cs-N'M004 presents a certain improvement with respect to the unpromoted catalyst. The catalytic activity of the studied catalysts is clearly in agreement with the structural and chemical features described above. It was seen that cesium doping inhibits the a -> transition, decreases the catalyst surface area and increases the catalyst basicity, although overdoping with 6% Cs-NiMo04 leads to a decrease in basicity with respect to the other doped catalysts.

It is well known that the CO,, formation is favoured by an increase in the catalyst acidity [5,16]. In our case, the basicity decrease originated by overdoping induces an increase of carbon oxides formation, mainly COZ. The C4's yield increases for a-phase with all the promoted catalysts, but this improvement is less for the 6% Cs-NiMo04 due to the overdoping effect. In phase, this improvement is only observed with the 1 % Cs catalyst, while at greater cesium contents the C4's yield even a - phase 4? x , 321 decreases with respect to the unpromoted catalyst due to the a-phase stabilisation and the overdoping effect. The effect of surface area decrease is easily eliminated if rates of butane conversion are based on unity surface area (Fig. 9). In such circumstances, the catalytic differences observed when cesium content is changed must originate from different basicities. An increase in the catalyst basicity leads to a decrease in the catalytic activity because the butane-catalyst surface interactions are weakened.

Influence of cesium surface content on butane conversion rate for a- and phases at different temperatures. cant decrease in the conversion rate is observed at 1 % Cs doped ot-N'M004 and this decrease attenuates at higher contents of cesium. In hase a minimum rate is observed at 1% CsNiMo04. The increase of the activity normalized to surface area at higher Cs loadings is probably due to overdoping and to the stabilization of the a-phase, as has been noticed by C02-TPD and HTXRD experiments, respectively. 4. Conclusions It has been confirmed by HTXRD measurements that both oc- and phases of nickel molybdate are stable in the reaction temperature range used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of butane. The doping of NiMo04 with cesium does not produce structural changes in the catalyst at room temperature but it restrains the ato phase transition, especially at high concen- trations of promoter (3 and 6%), for which only 50% transition was achieved. Alkali promoter remains essentially on the catalyst surface, blocking the catalyst pores, thus decreasing the catalyst surface area as the Cs concentration is raised, both for a- and phases. C02-TPD measurements with the promoted catalysts evidence that catalyst basicity increases with respect to the unpromoted N'M004. However, a basicity decrease is noticed for the 6% Cs-ot-NiM004 due to overdoping. Such properties of the catalysts are in agreement with the results of the catalytic tests. The catalytic activity decreases for both phases following the sequence: unpromoted > 1% Cs > 3% Cs > 6% Cs. The same trend is observed for a-phase when activity is normalized to surface area. The phase shows a minimum at 1% Cs and an increase at higher cesium concentrations. This increase in surface normalized activity possibly emanates from stabilization of a-phase and overdoping. The C4's formation is favoured by the cesium presence although in the case of 6% Cs-NiM004 the overdoping leads to an increase of the CO,, selectivity.

The effect of doping NiMoO4 with increasing Cs concentrations (1, 3 and 6%), on the crystalline structure, chemical nature and catalytic behaviour for the oxidative dehydrogenation of butane, was studied. The atomic ratio Mo/Ni = 1 and the cesium concentration were checked by several techniques (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic absorption, inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy). The structural study of the α- and β-phases was carried out by high temperature X-ray diffraction and showed that Cs does not affect the molybdate structure at room temperature. However it makes the transition from α- to β-phase by heating difficult. Cs remains on the catalyst surface blocking pores and reducing BET surface area. The acid and basic natures of the catalysts were studied by NH3 and CO2 temperature programmed desorption, respectively. The formation of nitrogenated compounds during the NH3-TPD was observed. CO2-TPD shows an increase in the catalyst basicity with Cs doping, but overdoping was observed for the 6% CsNiMoO4 catalyst. The catalytic tests showed a decrease of activity with the Cs content. In both the α- and β-phases the selectivity to dehydrogenation products increases with the Cs contents, but tends to decrease for the 6% CsNiMoO4, due to the overdoping effect. This effect in the α-phase and the β-phase stabilisation in the catalyst with higher Cs contents, contributes to an increase of the activity normalised to surface area.
