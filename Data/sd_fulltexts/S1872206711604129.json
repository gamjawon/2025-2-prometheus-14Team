DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(11)60412-9 ARTICLE Conversion of Isobutane in Presence of Carbon Dioxide over Molybdenum Oxide Catalysts Obtained from Heteropolymolybdate Precursors Ahmed AOUISSI*, Daif ALDHAYAN, Saad ALKAHTANI Chemistry Departement, College of Science, King Saud University, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Abstract: Molybdenum based oxide catalysts Mo-H, Mo-Fe, Mo-Ce, and Mo-Sn were prepared by calcining H 3 PMo 12 O 40 , Fe 1.5 PMo 12 O 40 , Ce 1.5 PMo 12 O 40 , and Sn 1.5 PMo 12 O 40 heteropolyanion precursors at 700 Â°C, respectively. The prepared oxides have been characterized and tested for the dehydrogenation of isobutane (IB) to isobutene in the presence of CO 2 . The effects of temperature, time on stream and CO 2 /IB ratio were investigated. It was found that Ä®- and E-MoO 3 phases were present in all catalysts. Catalytic tests showed that increasing the reaction temperature increased both the conversion and isobutene selectivity, whereas increasing the CO 2 /IB molar ratio increased the conversion but decreased the selectivity for isobutene. Iron was found to be an effective additive element for the enhancement of catalytic activity compared with Ce and Sn. Key words: isobutane; isobutene; heteropoly compound; mixed oxide; carbon dioxide Isobutene is one of the most important chemical intermedi- ates with a wide range of applications. It is used as a feedstock in the production of oxygenated compounds such as methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE) and alkylates for motor fuels. It is also used widely to produce polyisobutene, butyl rubber, methyl acrylates, and other chemicals. The increasing demand for isobutene has drawn considerable attention towards enhancing its production. Currently, it is produced industrially by the dehydrogenation of isobutane (IB) over a Cr 2 O 3 -Al 2 O 3 catalyst at 900 K [1]. Owing to the endothermic nature of this reaction, elevated temperatures are necessary to achieve acceptable levels of conversion. These extreme operating conditions favor coke formation and catalyst deactivation. As a consequence, the process requires feeds diluted with hydrogen or steam and short reaction cycles with frequent regenerations. Therefore, researchers are pursuing ways to improve isobutene yield and catalyst stability. One route is the oxidative dehydrogenation of IB. In fact, oxidative dehydrogenation is an effective way to increase conversion and lower the reaction temperature. However, as the formation of carbon oxides is thermody- namically more favorable than the formation of isobutene, the selectivity for isobutene decreases rapidly with increase in IB conversion when using oxygen as the oxidant [2,3]. Recently, the utilization of carbon dioxide in IB dehydrogenation has been attempted [4â€“6]. This reaction is attractive because car- bon dioxide is affordable and naturally abundant and the re- sulting process would lead to consumption of a greenhouse gas. However, there are still some disadvantages associated with such a process, for example, the isobutene yield and catalyst stability over current available catalysts are still unsatisfactory for practical applications. An improved process would require the development of catalysts that perform well under severely deactivating conditions. For that purpose, several oxides have been tested as catalysts and it has been found that the dehy- drogenation strongly depends on redox [7â€“9] and the acid-base properties of the catalyst [10â€“12]. This research work deals with the dehydrogenation of IB over a series of oxides prepared from Keggin-type heteropolyanions as precursors. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation Ahmed AOUISSI et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1474â€“1479 12-Molybdophosphoric acid, H 3 PMo 12 O 40 Â˜13H 2 O and its salts Fe 1.5 PMo 12 O 40 Â˜13H 2 O, Ce 1.5 PMo 12 O 40 Â˜13H 2 O and Sn 1.5 PMo 12 O 40 Â˜13H 2 O were prepared according to a method described previously [13]. The oxides were obtained by cal- cination of the corresponding heteropolyanions, under an air flow of 6 L/h and 700 Â°C over 2 h. They were denoted Mo-H, Mo-Fe, Mo-Ce, and Mo-Sn, referring to their counter-cations (Fe 3+ , Ce 3+ , and Sn 3+ ). Another catalyst denoted Mo-(Fe-Ce) was prepared by mixing 1 mol/L Fe 1.5 PMo 12 O 40 Â˜13H 2 O and Ce 1.5 PMo 12 O 40 Â˜13H 2 O aqueous solutions in a volume ratio of 9. 1.2 Catalyst characterization The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on Siemens D5000 diffractometer with Cu K Ä® (O = 0.15418 nm) radiation. Fourier transform infrared (IR) spectra of the sam- ples were recorded with a Shimadzu FTIR Spectrometer 8400S at ambient conditions by grinding the sample with KBr and pressing it into a pellet. 1.3 Catalytic measurements Catalytic activities and selectivities were measured using a continuous-flow fixed bed reactor under atmospheric pressure. The catalyst (0.1 g) packed into a stainless reactor was pre- conditioned under CO 2 flow for 2 h at the reaction temperature. After pretreatment, the reagent mixture CO 2 /IB with desired molar ratio at a flow rate of 50 ml/min was fed into the reactor. The CO 2 and IB gas flows were controlled by mass flow con- troller. The reaction products were analyzed with a gas phase chromatograph (Agilent 6890N) equipped with flame ioniza- tion detector, thermal conductivity detector and capillary column (HP-PLOT Q, length 30 m, inner diameter 0.53 mm). 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Infrared characterization IR spectra of the Keggin-type heteropolyanion precursors (before calcination) are shown in Fig. 1. The main character- istic features of the Keggin structure are observed for all pre- pared catalysts. The bands observed at 1080â€“1060, 990â€“960, 900â€“870, and 810â€“760 cm â€“1 are assigned to the asymmetric stretching vibrations of the J as (Pâ€“Oa), J as (Moâ€“Od), J as (Moâ€“Ocâ€“Mo) and J as (Moâ€“Ocâ€“Mo) bonds, respectively [13,14]. 2.2 XRD measurements Table 1 presents the d-spacings corresponding to the most significant peaks in the patterns of the four calcined heter- opolyanions and Ä®-MoO 3 and E-MoO 3 . It can be seen that the mixed oxides have slightly different values from the pure ox- ides. The results indicated that Mo-H presented the typical features related to the most intense lines of the orthorhombic Ä®-MoO 3 [15] along with some lines of the monoclinic E-MoO 3 [16]. As for the rest of the catalyst series, it can be seen that besides Ä®-MoO 3 and E-MoO 3 , the catalysts contain the iron, cerium and tin oxide resulting from the corresponding cation (Fe, Ce, and Sn) in the precursor heteropolyanion. The dif- fraction peaks occurred at 0.3006, 0.2702, and 0.1632 nm and ascribed to (111), (200), (220) crystal planes are characteristic of the cubic fluorite structured CeO 2 (JCPDS 43-1002) [17]. In addition, reflections that are characteristic of Ce 2 Mo 4 O 15 occurred with a d spacing at 0.344, 0.325, 0.307, and 0.269 nm (JCPDS 30-0304).

Ahmed AOUISSI et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1474â€“1479 ides showed that the Mo-Fe catalyst corresponds to the ortho- rhombic ferric molybdate (Fe-MoO 3 ) [18]. As for tin oxide, the observed diffraction patterns at 0.2708, 0.2344, 0.1505, and 0.1436 nm which were associated with the (101), (200), (310), and (301) planes, respectively, are ascribed to SnO 2 (JCPDS 88â€“287) [19]. Nevertheless, other phases could be present as traces. In fact, the coexistence of various phases besides the main phase has been reported for several oxides [20,21]. 2.3 Catalytic activity 2.3.1 Effect of reaction temperature on IB dehydrogenation The effect of reaction temperature was studied in the range 500â€“600 Â°C. The dependence of conversion and selectivity on time on stream over Mo-H at different temperatures is shown in Figs. 2 and 3. It can be seen from Fig. 2 that the IB conversion rate remained almost constant with time on stream for the lower reaction temperatures and decreased slightly beyond 4 h on time on stream for higher reaction temperatures. Similarly the selectivity for isobutene showed the same trend (Fig. 3). As for the variation in conversion and selectivity to isobutene with temperature (Fig. 4), the result showed a significant increase at 600 Â°C. This result is in agreement with that of SkrzyÄ”ska et al. [22] where it was reported that the highest temperature below which carbon dioxide was not activated and did not take part in IB dehydrogenation over a VMgO x catalyst was around 527â€“553 Â°C. The presence of CO 2 enhanced the IB dehydro- genation yield significantly and is generally attributed to the fact that CO 2 as a weak oxidant can eliminate hydrogen pro- duced during dehydrogenation through the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction [23â€“25]: C 4 H 10 Äº C 4 H 8 + H 2 CO 2 + H 2 Äº CO + H 2 O 2.3.2 Effect of CO 2 /IB molar ratio on IB dehydrogenation The effect of the variation in amount of CO 2 on IB dehy- drogenation was investigated at 600 Â°C. The CO 2 /IB molar ratio was varied from 1 to 5.

Ahmed AOUISSI et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1474â€“1479 remained almost constant for the lower molar ratios. As for the dependence of conversion and isobutene selectivity on CO 2 /IB molar ratio (Fig. 6), the results showed that the conversion increased with increase in amount of CO 2 , whereas the isobu- tene selectivity decreased. The decrease in conversion with time on stream for the highest molar ratio results from the increase and accumulation of coke deposition during the reac- tion. It has been reported [26,27] that the amount of coke de- posited on the catalyst increased with increase in reaction temperature and for the CO 2 /ethylbenzene ratio, the larger the amount of IB converted, the more coke deposited. This result confirmed that carbon dioxide takes part in the dehydrogena- tion process, enhancing IB conversion. The carbon dioxide stream was able to gasify a portion of the coke deposit formed on the Mo-H catalyst surface, but did not remove all of the deposit. The rate of coking was faster than that of decoking. 2.3.3 Reactivity of different oxides The activity of four catalysts Mo-H, Mo-Fe, Mo-Sn, and Mo-Ce was compared for the conversion of IB at 600 Â°C, with a reactant mixture n(CO 2 )/n(IB) = 5. The results, reported in Fig. 7, showed that IB conversion decreased with time on stream for higher conversion while no significant decrease was noticed for lower conversions. In fact, the conversion obtained over Mo-H decreased from 90.0% to 59.4% when the time on stream increased from 1 to 5 h which represent a decrease of 30.6%. Similarly, the conversion obtained over Mo-Sn de- creased from 83.2% to 62.8% when the time on stream in- creased from 1 to 5 h which represented a decrease of 20.4%. Isobutene selectivity over Mo-Ce decreased with time on stream. The decrease in both the conversion and isobutene selectivity with time on stream suggests that besides catalytic cracking, thermocracking has also occurred. The conversion and selectivity of the products obtained at 5 h of time on stream over the series of catalysts are represented in Fig. 9. The results show that the conversion obtained over Mo-Fe and Mo-Ce was 37.1% and 5.56%, respectively. As for the selectivity, Mo-Fe and Mo-Ce were the most selective to yield isobutene with values of 16.1 and 22.1%, respectively. 12345 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Conversion S(isobutene) CO 2 /IB molar ratio C o n v e r s i o n ( % ) 4.8 5.0 5.2 5.4 5.6 5.8 6.0 6.2 6.4 6.6 S ( i s o b u t e n e ) / % Fig. 6.

Ahmed AOUISSI et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1474â€“1479 2.3.4 Reactivity of Fe 2 O 3 /Ce 2 O 3 /MoO 3 mixed oxide catalysts Taking into account that the highest conversion and selec- tivity of isobutene was obtained over Mo-Fe and Mo-Ce re- spectively, we attempted to compare the activity of these catalysts with that of the catalyst constituted from both the Mo-Fe and Mo-Ce oxides. The catalyst with Mo-Fe/Mo-Ce = 9 mass ratio designated Mo-(Fe-Ce) was tested under the same conditions. The variation in conversion with time on stream is represented in Fig. 10. It can be seen that the Mo-(Fe-Ce) catalyst led to a higher conversion than the Mo-Fe and Mo-Ce. Unlike the conversion, the selectivity for isobutene was less than that obtained over Mo-Fe and Mo-Ce (Fig. 11). The highest activity obtained with Mo-(Fe-Ce) indicated that Mo-Fe and Mo-Ce have a synergistic effect on IB conversion. It has been mentioned that partially reduced ceria can donate electrons to iron oxide in the RGWS reaction [28]. Thus, the presence of CO 2 produces redox couples (Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ) [25] which can further promote the reduction of ceria and the oxi- dation of iron. 3 Conclusions Molybdenum-based oxides prepared by calcining Keg- gin-type heteropolymolybdates as precursors were character- ized and tested for their conversion of IB with CO 2 . The effect of reaction temperature and amount of CO 2 was investigated. It was found that all obtained oxides contain orthorhombic Ä®-MoO 3 and monoclinic È•-MoO 3 as main phases. Results from the catalytic tests at various temperatures suggested that CO 2 is activated and takes part in the dehydrogenation process at 600 Â°C. The increase in CO 2 /IB molar ratio initially increased conversion but this subsequently decreased with time on stream.

Thus, the presence of CO 2 produces redox couples (Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ) [25] which can further promote the reduction of ceria and the oxi- dation of iron. 3 Conclusions Molybdenum-based oxides prepared by calcining Keg- gin-type heteropolymolybdates as precursors were character- ized and tested for their conversion of IB with CO 2 . The effect of reaction temperature and amount of CO 2 was investigated. It was found that all obtained oxides contain orthorhombic Ä®-MoO 3 and monoclinic È•-MoO 3 as main phases. Results from the catalytic tests at various temperatures suggested that CO 2 is activated and takes part in the dehydrogenation process at 600 Â°C. The increase in CO 2 /IB molar ratio initially increased conversion but this subsequently decreased with time on stream. The decrease may result from an accumulation of coke deposition during the reaction suggested that the rate of coking was faster than the rate of decoking. Mo-(Fe-Ce) mixed oxides exhibited a higher conversion than that obtained on single Mo-Fe and Mo-Ce oxides owing to a synergistic effect.

Tel: +966-1-467-5958; Fax: +966-1-467-5992 Molybdenum based oxide catalysts Mo-H, Mo-Fe, Mo-Ce, and Mo-Sn were prepared by calcining H3PMo12O40, Fe1.5PMo12O40, Ce1.5PMo12O40, and Sn1.5PMo12O40 heteropolyanion precursors at 700 °C, respectively. The prepared oxides have been characterized and tested for the dehydrogenation of isobutane (IB) to isobutene in the presence of CO2. The effects of temperature, time on stream and CO2/IB ratio were investigated. It was found that α- and β-MoO3 phases were present in all catalysts. Catalytic tests showed that increasing the reaction temperature increased both the conversion and isobutene selectivity, whereas increasing the CO2/IB molar ratio increased the conversion but decreased the selectivity for isobutene. Iron was found to be an effective additive element for the enhancement of catalytic activity compared with Ce and Sn. Graphical abstract Mixed Mo-M oxides (M = Sn, Fe, and Ce) were prepared by decomposition of Keggin-type (H3PMo12O40, Fe1.5PMo12O40, Ce1.5PMo12O40, and Sn1.5PMo12O40) heteropolyanions. Catalytic tests for the dehydrogenation of isobutane in the presence of CO2 showed that the Mo-Fe mixed oxides were the optimum catalysts of the series.
