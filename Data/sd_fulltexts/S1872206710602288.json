KEANE* Chemical Engineering, School of Engineering and Physical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Scotland, United Kingdom Abstract: Catalytic hydrodechlorination (HDC) is an innovative means of transforming chlorinated waste streams into a recyclable product. In this study, the gas phase HDC of chlorobenzene (CB) has been studied over bulk Pd and Ni and ((8 Â± 1) wt%) Pd and Ni sup- ported on activated carbon (AC), graphite, graphitic nanofibers (GNF), Al 2 O 3 , and SiO 2 . Catalyst activation was examined by tempera- ture-programmed reduction (TPR) analysis and the activated catalysts characterized in terms of BET area, transmission electron micros- copy, scanning electron microscopy, H 2 chemisorption/temperature-programmed desorption, and X-ray diffraction measurements. Metal surface area (1â€“19 m 2 /g), TPR, and H 2 uptake/release exhibited a dependence on both metal and support. The Pd system delivered specific HDC rates that were up to three orders of magnitude greater than that recorded for the Ni catalysts, a result that we link to the higher H 2 diffusivity in Pd. HDC was 100% selective over Ni while Pd also produced cyclohexane (selectivity < 4%) as a result of a combined HDC/hydrogenation. Bulk Pd outperformed carbon supported Pd but was less active than Pd on the oxide supports. In contrast, unsupported Ni presented no measurable activity when compared with supported Ni. The specific HDC rate was found to increase with decreasing metal surface area where spillover hydrogen served to enhance HDC performance. Key words: hydrodechlorination; chlorobenzene; bulk palladium and nickel catalysts; activated carbon; graphite; carbon nanofiber; alu- mina; silica; spillover hydrogen Halogen containing waste is typically xenobiotic and, hav- ing no analogous compounds in nature, there is no natural means of ameliorating the negative environmental impact. The presence of organo-halogens in effluent discharges is of in- creasing concern due to the mounting evidence of adverse stratospheric ozone, ecological, and public health impacts [1,2]. The legislation imposed by regulatory bodies is certain to become increasingly more restrictive. This has leant an added degree of urgency to the development of effective control strategies. In addition to the legislative demands, the economic pressures faced by the commercial sector in the 21st century include loss of potentially valuable resources through waste, escalating disposal charges and increasing raw material/energy costs. Chloro-aromatics, the focus of this study, are commer- cially important chemicals, used as end products and interme- diates in the manufacture of plastics, dyes, a diversity of ag- rochemicals, and as heat transfer media [3,4]. Catalytic hy- drodechlorination (HDC) is now recognized as a non-destructive low energy methodology for the transforma- tion of toxic chlorinated streams into valuable raw material with no directly associated NO x /SO x emissions or dioxin/furan formation [3,5]. In this study, we have adopted the HDC of chlorobenzene (CB) as a model reaction to probe support ef- fects for reaction over Pd and Ni catalysts. Catalytic CB HDC has been investigated using an array of supported metals, notably Pd [6â€“15], Pt [7,8,16], Ni [7â€“9,16â€“25], Rh [8,16], and Ru [16,26] where the supports that have been used include carbon [7,19â€“21,26], ZrO 2 [6], Al 2 O 3 [7,11,19â€“21,24], SiO 2 [12,13,18â€“22,24], MgO [15,19â€“21,24], Nb 2 O 5 [14], TiO 2 [10,24], zeolite [24], and AlF 3 [7]. The pri- Claudia AMORIM et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 746â€“755 mary function of the catalyst support is to provide a surface on which the metal is dispersed in order to obtain smaller metal particle sizes and, consequently, higher metal surface areas which, in turn, can favorably impact on catalytic activity. Moreover, product selectivity and catalyst stability can also be influenced by the nature of the catalyst support [3]. Such fac- tors as metal-support interaction, porosity, and acid-base properties have been considered to a limited extent in catalytic dehalogenation applications [3,8,19,27]. It should be noted that the studies cited above did not consider the HDC response of the corresponding unsupported metal, which is an essential test of the influence of the support on intrinsic catalytic activity. Wu and Xu [28] have, however, compared the action of Raney Ni with Ni/AC, Ni/Al 2 O 3 , and Ni/SiO 2 in the liquid phase HDC of CB (at 1 MPa H 2 ) and found that Raney Ni outperformed Ni/Al 2 O 3 and Ni/SiO 2 but was less active than Ni/AC. Unsupported mono- and bi-metallic catalysts such as Pd [29â€“31], Ni [32â€“34], Pd/Fe [35], Pd/Zn [35], Pt/Fe [35], and Ni/Fe [35] have been used to promote the dehalogenation of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) [30,31,33], dichlorotetrafluoro- ethane [29,31], chloroethenes [35], vinyl chloride [35], di- chlorobenzene [34], trichlorobenzene [32], and chloro-organic mixtures [35]. While it may be expected that a well dispersed supported metal catalyst should exhibit higher specific activity than the bulk metal, there are examples in the literature [30,33,36] of unsupported systems that deliver similar or greater dehalogenation rates when compared with corre- sponding supported catalyst(s). The properties of a catalyst support critical to achieving optimum HDC performance have yet to be conclusively established. In this paper, we compare the action of supported and unsupported Pd and Ni in the gas phase HDC of CB, linking the catalytic response to pertinent catalyst characterization measurements. Five different sup- ports, three carbon-based and two oxides, have been consid- ered: (1) conventional activated carbon (AC); (2) graphite; (3) graphitic nanofibers (GNF); (4) Al 2 O 3 ; (5) SiO 2 . Application of Pd/GNF and Pd/graphite in CB HDC was first reported in our previous work [37] and a search through the literature failed to unearth any reports of Ni/GNF use as catalyst in HDC proc- esses. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported direct comparison of gas phase CB HDC over unsupported Pd and Ni and the corresponding oxide/carbon supported catalysts. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation and activation The AC (G-60, 100 mesh) support was obtained from NORIT (UK), the graphite (synthetic 1â€“2 Pm powder), and SiO 2 (fumed) were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich and the Al 2 O 3 support (Puralox) was provided by Condea Vista Co. The GNF support was synthesized by the catalytic decomposition of ethylene, as described in detail previously [27,38], contacted with 1 mol/L HNO 3 to remove any residual metal particles and subjected to a partial oxidation (in 5% v/v O 2 /He) at 673 K for 2 h to remove the amorphous carbon content. The commercial AC and graphite samples were also subjected to the same demineralization; the carbon supports were thoroughly washed with deionized water (until pH approached 7) and oven-dried at 383 K for 12 h. The supported Pd and Ni catalysts ((8 Â± 1) wt%) were prepared by standard impregnation where a 2-butanolic Pd(NO 3 ) 2 or Ni(NO 3 ) 2 solution was added drop wise at 353 K to the substrate with constant agitation (600 r/min) and oven dried at 393 K for 16 h. The metal loading (reproducible to within Â± 4%) was determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Vista-PRO, Varian Inc.). Prior to use in catalysis, the precur- sors, sieved (ATM fine test sieves) into a batch of 75 Î¼m av- erage particle diameter, were reduced directly in a 60 cm 3 /min stream of ultra-pure dry H 2 at 10 K/min to (523 Â± 1) K (Pd system) or (723 Â± 1) K (Ni system), which was maintained for at least 12 h. PdO (99.998%) and NiO (99%), the unsupported Pd and Ni catalyst precursors, respectively, were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and activated as above. 1.2 Catalyst characterization BET surface area, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), H 2 chemisorption and temperature-programmed de- sorption (TPD) analyses were conducted on the bulk metals and supported catalysts using the commercial CHEMBET 3000 (Quantachrome Instrument) unit, employing a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) where a known mass (Â” 0.1 g) of sample was loaded into a U-tube (10 cm u 3.76 mm i.d.): data acquisition/manipulation employed the TPR Win TM software. BET areas were recorded in a 30% v/v N 2 /He flow; pure N 2 (99.9%) served as the internal standard. At least two cycles of N 2 adsorption-desorption were employed to determine total surface area using the standard single point method. TPR em- ployed a reducing gas mixture of 5% v/v H 2 /N 2 (mass flow controlled at 20 cm 3 /min) with a heating rate of 10 K/min to 523 K (for Pd catalysts) or 723 K (for Ni catalysts); the effluent gas was directed through a liquid N 2 trap. The reduced samples were swept with a flow of N 2 for 1 h, cooled to room tem- perature, and subjected to H 2 chemisorption using a pulse (50 Î¼l) titration procedure. At this pulse volume, the maximum partial pressure of H 2 in the sample cell (0.004 atm) was well below 0.013 atm, the pressure needed for Pd hydride formation at room temperature [39]. Hydrogen pulse introduction was repeated until the signal area was constant, indicating surface saturation. The specific metal surface area (S, m 2 /g) of the supported catalysts was calculated from H 2 chemisorption assuming an adsorption stoichiometry of H:Me = 1:1 (Me = Pd or Ni). The samples were then thoroughly flushed with N 2 for 30 min and TPD was conducted in N 2 at 50 K/min to 873 K. Claudia AMORIM et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 746â€“755 Based on TCD calibrations and analysis of the effluent gas using a MICROMASS PC Residual Gas Analyzer, the TPD profiles recorded in this paper can be attributed solely to H 2 release. BET surface area and H 2 uptake values were repro- ducible to within Â± 3% and the values quoted in this paper are the mean. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were re- corded with a Philips Xâ€™Pert instrument using Ni filtered Cu K D radiation. The samples were mounted in a low background sample holder and scanned at a rate of 0.02Âº/s over the range 20Âº d 2T d 90Â°. The diffraction patterns were compared with the JCPDS-ICDD [40] reference data for identification pur- poses. Analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out using a Hitachi S900 field emission SEM, operated at an accelerating voltage of 25 kV; the sample was deposited on a standard aluminum SEM holder and coated with gold. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses were con- ducted using a JEOL 2000 TEM microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The catalyst sample was dis- persed in 1-butanol by ultrasonic vibration, deposited on a lacey-carbon/Cu grid (200 Mesh), and dried at 383 K for 12 h before TEM analysis. 1.3 Catalysis procedure Reactions were carried out under atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed glass reactor (i.d. = 15 mm) with a co-current flow of CB in H 2 at 423 K (for Pd catalysts) or 473 K (for Ni catalysts). The catalytic reactor, and operating conditions/criteria em- ployed to ensure negligible heat/mass transport limitations, have been described in detail elsewhere [41,42] but some fea- tures, pertinent to this study, are given below. CB HDC was performed at inlet Cl to metal ratios of 3.1 Ã— 10 2 â€“6.1 Ã— 10 3 mol Cl /(mol Pd Â·h) and 90 mol Cl /(mol Ni Â·h) where the GHSV was maintained at 2 u 10 4 h â€“1 . The CB reactant was fed by means of a microprocessor controlled infusion pump (Model 100, kd Scientific) via a glass/teflon air tight syringe and a teflon line to the reactor in a stream of ultra pure H 2 , the flow rate of which was monitored using a Humonics 520 digital flow meter. The reaction products were analyzed by capillary GC as described previously [42]. The relative peak area % was converted to mol% using regression equations based on detailed calibration and the detection limit corresponded to a feedstock conversion < 0.4 mol%: overall analytic reproducibility was better than Â± 3%. Repeated catalytic runs with different samples from the same batch of catalyst delivered product compositions that were reproducible to within Â± 7%. As blank tests, passage of CB in a stream of H 2 through the empty reactor or over the supports alone, i.e. in the absence of Pd or Ni, did not result in any detectable conversion. The CB reactant was used as re- ceived (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%) and ultra high purity (99.999%) H 2 , He, and N 2 were supplied by Scott-Gross Co. Inc. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Catalyst characterization Metal loading (supported catalysts), BET surface area, H 2 uptake, and specific metal surface areas (S) are given in Table 1. The AC support is characterized by a large surface area with significant micro-/meso-porosity (average pore radius = 3.2 nm); pore volume = 0.5 cm 3 /g. Graphite has limited porosity (pore volume < 0.05 cm 3 /g) with a low associated surface area. The high aspect (length to diameter) ratio and fibrous nature of the GNF support is immediately apparent from the SEM shown in Fig. 1(a). High resolution TEM analysis, presented else- where [43], has demonstrated that the GNF support is charac- Fig. 1.

A representative TEM image presented in Fig. 1(b) illustrates the nature of the Pd particle morphology and dispersion on the GNF support. The interest in GNF as a catalyst support has increased in the last decade with applications in hydrogenation [43â€“46], ammonia synthesis [47], selective oxidation [48], and hydrazine decomposition [49]. This is due, in part, to the lower associated mass transfer constraints when compared with AC [44,48]. Moreover, AC exhibits variable structural characteristics when produced from different sources [49] while there is greater control over GNF structure during synthesis [44]. BET surface areas of the Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 based catalysts are similar and are in agreement with val- ues quoted in the literature [50,51]. The XRD patterns for the activated samples, given in Fig. 2, show no evidence of any bulk PdO or NiO. The four peaks that characterize the Pd samples (see Fig. 2(a)) at 2È™ = 40.1 o , 46.7 o , 68.1 o , and 82.15 o correspond, respectively, to Pd(111), (200), (220), and (311) planes and are consistent with an exclusive cubic symmetry. The diffractograms generated for the Ni samples (Fig. 2(b)) exhibit three peaks (at 44.5 o , 51.8 o , and 76.3 o , corresponding to (111), (200), and (220) planes of me- tallic nickel), also characteristic of cubic symmetry. The markers included in Fig. 2 illustrate the position and relative intensity of the XRD peaks for cubic Pd and Ni, taken from the JCPDS standards [40]. The XRD patterns for Pd/graphite and Ni/graphite are dominated by a peak at 2È™ = 26 o that is char- acteristic of structured (graphitic) carbon. While the XRD signals for Pd/GNF and Ni/GNF also demonstrate the strong presence of a graphitic phase, the broadness of the 2È™ = 26 o peak is indicative of a lesser long range structural order. The TPR profiles generated for all the Pd and Ni catalysts are given in Fig. 3. The level of reproducibility of the TPR response can be assessed from the repeated TPR measurements included in Fig. 3. The TPR profiles associated with the un- supported Pd and the three carbon supported Pd are charac- terized by a single negative peak, i.e. H 2 production. The oc- currence of a negative TPR peak has been observed previously and attributed to H 2 release due to the decomposition of E-phase Pd hydride [12,36,52]. It is well established that Pd can adsorb H 2 at room temperature to form a hydride [39,52] where the H 2 partial pressure exceeds 0.013 atm [39].

Claudia AMORIM et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 746â€“755 trast to Pd, the formation of Ni hydride at room temperature via contact with H 2 gas is very demanding, requiring H 2 pressures in excess of 3000 atm [53]. The temperature corresponding to maximum H 2 release/hydride decomposition for unsupported Pd (ca. 386 K) is higher than that (368â€“377 K) recorded for the supported catalysts. Palladium hydride decomposition from supported Pd has been reported in the literature to occur over the range 323â€“373 K [12,36,52â€“54]. Moreover, the decompo- sition temperature has been proposed to increase with in- creasing H 2 partial pressure and Pd particle size [52]. The latter response is consistent with our observation that a higher tem- perature is required for bulk Pd hydride decomposition com- pared with the supported systems. The absence of any detect- able H 2 consumption (during TPR) in advance of H 2 release suggests a room temperature reduction, prior to TPR. Indeed, there is a general agreement in the literature that the reduction of supported and unsupported PdO occurs at room temperature [55,56]. In addition to H 2 release/hydride decomposition, the TPR profiles for Pd/Al 2 O 3 and Pd/SiO 2 also included ill-defined positive peaks (H 2 consumption) during the tem- perature ramp that extended into the final isothermal hold in the case of Pd/Al 2 O 3 , suggesting an oxide support effect that serves to stabilize the Pd precursor, requiring a higher reduction temperature. This is in line with previous reports wherein H 2 consumption peaks up to 523 K were recorded for the TPR of PdO supported on Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 [57,58]. In contrast to the Pd system, the TPR profiles (Fig. 3(b)) of the Ni catalysts presented only positive peaks with a H 2 con- sumption during the temperature ramp; the associated T max values span the range 598â€“709 K. A two stage reduction has been proposed elsewhere [59] for the direct (without pre-calcination) TPR of a supported nickel nitrate precursor where thermal decomposition of the nitrate to NiO precedes the subsequent reduction of NiO to Ni 0 . TPR T max values at 630 K [60], 651 K [61], and 723 K [62] have been attributed to a reduction of NiO on SiO 2 . GonzÃ¡lez-Marcos and co-workers [63] linked their single TPR peak at 601 K directly to Ni(NO 3 ) 2 decomposition. The TPR profile generated in this study for bulk NiO yielded a single broad peak (573â€“723 K) that is in good agreement with the measurements provided by Roh et al. [64] and matches the higher temperature region of H 2 con- sumption associated with the supported catalysts. The TPR response recorded for the five supported Ni catalysts must represent a composite decomposition of the supported nitrate precursor with a subsequent (and possible concomitant) re- duction of NiO to Ni 0 where any differences in the temperature requirements reflect differences in interfacial energies between nickel and each support. Ni/Al 2 O 3 exhibits distinct behavior in that the reduction profile presents two distinguishable peaks, the second stage of reduction occurring during the final iso- thermal hold and must represent NiO reduction. TPR profiles for Ni/Al 2 O 3 with one [64], two [65], and even four [51] re- duction peaks have been reported in the literature. The higher temperature reduction suggests metal/support interaction that necessitates a higher reduction temperature: electron transfer from Al 2 O 3 has been proposed elsewhere [66].

Claudia AMORIM et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 746â€“755 hydrogen adsorption, to determine specific metal surface areas; values are given in Table 1. Hydrogen uptake was higher on the supported catalysts when compared with bulk metal, as ex- pected, where the support serves to disperse the metal, result- ing in higher specific metal surface areas and increased gas uptake. Two catalysts (Pd/Al 2 O 3 and Ni/AC) were subjected to comprehensive TEM analysis and representative images are given in Fig. 4, which also includes the particle size distribu- tion histograms. The metal surface area obtained from the size distributions (based on total metal particle counts in excess of 800) agreed to within r 8% with the values generated by hy- drogen chemisorption. TPD following H 2 chemisorption generated the profiles presented in Fig. 5 for Pd and Ni catalysts. Duplicate TPD measurements are included to demonstrate the degree of ex- perimental reproducibility. TPD profiles for the supported catalysts are characterized by two broad peaks, a lower tem- perature peak with a T max that spans the range 521â€“640 K (Pd catalysts) and 492â€“636 K (Ni catalysts) and a higher tem- perature peak with a T max from 850 K that extends into the final isothermal hold (873 K). It is worth noting that Ni/Al 2 O 3 pre- sents three stages of TPD with an intermediate H 2 release (T max = 785 K). Cesteros et al. [67] have also recorded three H 2 desorption peaks (T max = ca. 410, 720, and 820 K) from Ni/Al 2 O 3 . TPD from unsupported Pd only exhibited a lower temperature H 2 release while there was no measurable H 2 desorption from bulk Ni; any H 2 desorbed from unsupported Ni was below detection limits (< 0.02 cm 3 /g). A direct comparison of the H 2 -TPD profiles generated in this study with the limited reports in the literature is problematic given the differences in metal loading, support, catalyst preparation/activation and desorption procedure. Hydrogen TPD analysis is, nonetheless, a useful characterization technique to probe surface adsor- bate/adsorbent (both metal and support) interactions and to evaluate (indirectly) metal/support effects. Indeed, it has been established that different H 2 -TPD profiles are generated for the same metal (and similar loading) on different supports, e.g. 1 wt% Pd/C vs. Pd/Al 2 O 3 [68] and 1.5 wt% Ni/SiO 2 vs. 2.2 wt% Ni/Y-zeolite [69]. In this study, the occurrence of the additional higher temperature desorption peak for the supported catalysts can be attributed to the removal of spillover hydrogen from the support. This contention is consistent with the absence of a high temperature peak for the bulk metals. Moreover, the amount of H 2 released at T < 785 K (lower temperature peaks) matches that taken up in the chemisorption step (Table 1), which preceded TPD. In H 2 -TPD analysis of supported metal catalysts, hydrogen spillover has been linked to desorption at T > 503 K, regardless of the metal or support [70â€“74]. The spillover phenomenon describes the migration of atomic hy- drogen to the support after dissociation of molecular hydrogen on the metallic surface. Hydrogen spillover from metal to support has been reported in the literature for Pd [73â€“76] and Ni [69,71] on carbon [72â€“76], Al 2 O 3 [69,70] and SiO 2 [71] carriers. Ouchaib et al. [72] reported two H 2 desorption peaks from charcoal supported Pd at 373 and 673 K and attributed the higher temperature peak to spillover hydrogen. Dong et al. [74] concluded that hydrogen spillover takes place at 373 K on carbon supported Pd in order to account for H 2 uptake that exceeded the maximum Pd chemisorption capacity. Cheng et al. [75] recorded H 2 release from Pd/C during TPD that was higher than that predicted on the basis of the available surface Pd and attributed this to hydrogen spillover during the reduc- tion step (at 473 K). It can be seen from the profiles in Fig. 5 that the amount of hydrogen spillover varies according to the support and, in the case of the Ni systems, increased in the order: Ni/graphite (0.1 cm 3 /g) < Ni/Al 2 O 3 (0.4 cm 3 /g) < Ni/SiO 2 (0.7 cm 3 /g) < Ni/GNF (1.3 cm 3 /g) < Ni/AC (2.0 cm 3 /g). In the case of the Pd systems, Pd/Al 2 O 3 generated the greatest amount of spillover hydrogen (12.1 cm 3 /g), Pd/AC and Pd/SiO 2 , with quite different BET surface areas (see Table 1), delivered a similar high temperature hydrogen release ((2 Â± 0.5) cm 3 /g), exceeding that recorded for Pd/GNF (0.7 cm 3 /g) and Pd/graphite (0.1 cm 3 /g). These results suggest that the support surface area is not the only factor that can govern the 0 500 1000 1500 280 380 480 580 680 780 880 T e m p e r a t u r e ( K ) t/s (a) Ã—50 Ã—5 Ã—25 Ã—15 T P D s i g n a l Ã—5 (1) (4) (3) (2) (5) (6) 0 500 1000 1500 2000 280 380 480 580 680 780 880 T e m p e r a t u r e ( K ) t/s (b) (1) (4) (3) (2) (5) (6) Ã—10 T P D s i g n a l Fig. 5.

In addition to benzene, cyclohexane (selec- tivity < 4%) was isolated in the product stream generated over supported/unsupported Pd, resulting from a further hydro- genation of benzene. Indeed, HDC was promoted to a far greater degree over the Pd systems and when the reaction was operated under identical conditions, the supported Pd catalysts delivered activities that were up to three orders of magnitude greater than those recorded for supported Ni, a result that is in agreement with an earlier study that compared the HDC action of Pd/SiO 2 with Ni/SiO 2 [76]. In the dechlorination of di- chloromethane, Aristizabal et al. [77] found that the conversion over Pd/Al 2 O 3 was almost double that obtained with Ni/Al 2 O 3 . Simagina et al. [23] reported a 95% hexachlorobenzene con- version over Pd/C under reaction conditions where Ni/C was inactive. Moreover, Gomez-Sainero et al. [78], in studying the dechlorination of carbon tetrachloride to chloroform, recorded the following activity sequence: Pd/C >> Pt/C > Rh/C > Ru/C > Ni/C. A distinction should be drawn between HDC and de- hydrochlorination, the latter involving the internal elimination of HCl and is applicable to the dechlorination of aliphatic chloro-compounds (including CFCs) [41], where an external H 2 source is not necessary but can serve to limit deactivation [42]. In order to generate comparable HDC rates for both Ni and Pd catalysts and to ensure some differentiation in catalytic response for the various supported systems, two sets of HDC operating conditions were employed in this study (see ex- perimental section) and the resultant specific HDC rates (per metal surface area) are given in Table 2. It is noteworthy that bulk Pd outperformed the three carbon supported catalysts but was less active than the oxide based systems. In marked con- trast, unsupported Ni exhibited no measurable activity under conditions where each supported Ni generated a significant HDC rate. In order to achieve a comparable fractional CB dechlorination to that obtained with supported Ni, an eightfold increase in the mass of unsupported Ni was required with an increase in the reaction temperature by 100 K (to 573 K). While a consensus emerges from the literature that Pd is the most effective catalytic hydrodehalogenation agent, the precise source of this HDC efficiency has yet to be established. It is important to note that, as the decomposition of Pd hydride takes place where T < 400 K (see Fig. 2(a)) and HDC was performed at 423 K, any contribution due to Pd hydride can be discounted. The fact that the greater catalytic efficiency of Pd compared with Ni is not limited to HDC but also extends to hydrogenation reactions [79] suggests that H 2 /surface interac- tion is a critical factor. Differences in the heat of adsorption of H 2 can be used to probe adsorption dynamics where Watson et al. [80] reported that H 2 adsorption energies on the (111) sur- face of Pd and Ni single crystals were similar but different from that for Pt(111). Chou and Vannice [81] reported a heat of H 2 adsorption on bulk Pd and Pd supported on SiO 2 , SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 , Al 2 O 3 , and TiO 2 equal to (63 r 4) kJ/mol, dependent on particle size but independent of support. Weatherbee et al. [82] ob- served a support effect in the case of H 2 adsorption on Ni with a value of 90 kJ/mol for unsupported Ni, which is markedly lower than that recorded for Ni/Al 2 O 3 (122 kJ/mol). The available database of experimental and calculated heats of H 2 adsorption on Pd and Ni is insufficient to serve as a reliable indicator of HDC activity. It is, however, significant that the diffusion coefficient for H 2 in Pd (ca. 10 â€“11 m 2 /s) [83,84] is three orders of magnitude greater than that for Ni (ca. 10 â€“14 m 2 /s) [85], which is at the same scale as the difference in HDC activity recorded in this study. Moreover, it has been demon- strated that H 2 diffusivity in Pd-Ni alloys decreases with in- creasing Ni content [86]. A search through the literature did not reveal an explicit link between H 2 diffusion coefficients for catalytically active transition metals and performance in H 2 mediated reactions. We tentatively attribute the more facile diffusion of H 2 in Pd systems relative to Ni as a possible source of higher HDC activity. Specific HDC rates are plotted as a function of metal surface area (S) in Fig. 6 where (i) the higher specific activity associ- ated with the Pd catalysts is immediately evident and (ii) Pd and Ni systems exhibit a different HDC dependence on metal area. The Ni catalysts show an increase in specific HDC rate with decreasing metal surface area, which appears to converge to a rate invariance where S > 12 m 2 /g. HDC over bulk Pd and the three carbon supported Pd catalysts also increased with decreasing metal surface area but Pd/Al 2 O 3 and Pd/SiO 2 devi- ated significantly from this trend by presenting appreciably higher activities. Previous studies have shown that dehaloge- nation rates are enhanced at lower metal dispersion (or larger Table 2 Specific CB HDC rates (r) delivered by Pd and Ni catalysts Catalyst r/(mol Cl /(m 2 Â·h)) Pd 0.75 Pd/AC 0.50 Pd/graphite 0.15 Pd/GNF 0.28 Pd/Al 2 O 3 3.00 Pd/SiO 2 2.20 Ni â€” a Ni/AC 0.011 Ni/graphite 0.059 Ni/GNF 0.041 Ni/Al 2 O 3 0.010 Ni/SiO 2 0.005 a No measureable HDC activity.

In a number of dechlorination studies [29,31,34,35] that have involved un- supported metal catalysts, the dechlorination action of related supported metals was not considered. The studies that have compared dehalogenation performance of bulk and supported metals deal with gas phase CFC [30,33,88] and liquid phase CB [28] reactions. Rioux et al. [30] showed that CFC turnover rates recorded for Pd/C were equal to or four times greater than that of Pd black. It should, however, be noted that CFC trans- formation involves a dehydrohalogenation and struc- ture/activity relationships can differ from that which holds for catalytic HDC. Wu and Xu [28] recorded higher CB conver- sions over Raney Ni relative to Ni/Al 2 O 3 and Ni/SiO 2 but they did not provide characterization data that allow a direct com- parison of specific activities. Morato et al. [33] have reported higher CFC-12 and HCFC-22 turnover frequencies for bulk Ni relative to Ni supported on activated carbon or graphite. The higher activity delivered by unsupported Ni was attributed to particle size and morphology effects where octahedral particles were proposed to possess greater dehalogenation efficiency. In contrast, we did not observe any CB HDC activity for unsup- ported (cubic) Ni under conditions where supported Ni cata- lysts presented significant activities. The range of specific HDC rates recorded in Fig. 6 for supported metals suggests a catalyst support effect, especially when considering the higher activities delivered by Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 supported Pd. The supported Pd systems exhibited a twenty-fold difference in specific rate between the least (Pd/graphite) and most (Pd/Al 2 O 3 ) active catalysts while the values delivered by supported Ni differ by a factor of twelve when comparing the least (Ni/SiO 2 ) and most (Ni/graphite) active catalysts. Although an explicit link between catalyst support and HDC performance has yet to be established, there are a number of pertinent published studies that should be flagged. Benitez et al. [8] compared (liquid phase) CB HDC behavior of three supported Pd catalysts and recorded the following activity sequence: Pd/SiO 2 > Pd/Al 2 O 3 > Pd/C. On the other hand, in gas phase operation, Prati et al. [7] reported decreasing CB HDC activity in the order: Pd/C > Pd/Vycor (porous glass) > Pd/Al 2 O 3 >> Pd/AlF 3 . Wu and Xu [28] ob- served an increasing (liquid phase) CB HDC activity sequence, i.e. Ni/AC >> Ni/Al 2 O 3 > Ni/SiO 2 , that was attributed to the surface chemistry of the supports but the authors did not de- velop this correlation further. It is important to stress the di- vergence in the operation of batch liquid phase HDC reactions from our gas phase continuous flow system, notably with re- spect to temperature, contact time, and reactant feed concen- tration. Moreover, surface hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity and the involvement of a solvent can have a dramatic influence on liquid phase HDC where solution pH is a paramount factor [88 90]. Given the number of (interrelated) factors that can have a bearing on catalytic efficiency, it is difficult to pinpoint one catalyst property that determines HDC performance. However, it is clear from our results that metal-support inter- action is a contributory factor, impacting on TPR characteris- tics, ultimate metal surface area, H 2 uptake/release and the consequent HDC response. There is some evidence in the literature [91,92] for the involvement of spillover hydrogen in catalytic HDC. It is significant that the highest HDC rates were obtained with those catalysts (notably Pd/Al 2 O 3 ) that exhibited high spillover content. This suggests a surface synergistic effect where the occurrence of spillover contributes to en- hanced HDC performance. However, it should be noted that we have only considered the interaction of one of the reactants (H 2 ) with our family of catalysts and the dynamics of CB/surface (both metal and support) interaction can have a major bearing. A concerted effort to probe the nature of CB activation leading to C-Cl bond hydrogenolysis will form the basis of a future study. 3 Conclusions Bulk and supported (on AC, graphite, GNF, Al 2 O 3 , and SiO 2 ) Pd and Ni catalyst systems demonstrated quite distinct catalytic behaviour in gas phase CB HDC. While conversion of CB was 100% selective with respect to HDC over Ni, cyclo- hexane (selectivity < 4%) was also generated over sup- ported/unsupported Pd. Under the same operating conditions, supported Pd catalysts delivered specific HDC rates that were up to three orders of magnitude greater than that recorded for supported Ni. HDC performance of bulk Pd exceeded that of Pd on the three carbon supports while unsupported Ni was inactive under conditions where supported Ni exhibited sig- 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 0 5 10 15 20 0.00 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 Pd/graphite Pd/GNF Pd/AC Pd Pd/SiO 2 r / ( m o l C l / ( m 2 P d Â˜ h ) ) (a) Pd/Al 2 O 3 r / ( m o l C l / ( m 2 N i Â˜ h ) ) Ni/graphite Ni/GNF Ni/AC Ni/SiO 2 S/(m 2 /g) (b) Ni/Al 2 O 3 Fig. 6.

We propose that the higher activity delivered by Pd relative to Ni is associated with a more facile diffusion of H 2 in Pd. A support effect is evident from the range of surface areas exhibited by the supported metals and the divergence in the TPR and H 2 TPD response. Specific HDC rates over both supported Pd and Ni systems increased with decreasing specific metal area. Pd/Al 2 O 3 and Pd/SiO 2 deviate from a common trend line and delivered significantly higher HDC activities, a response that we ascribe to a contribution due to spillover hydrogen.

RESEARCH PAPER Application of Hydrodechlorination in Environmental Pollution Control: Comparison of the Performance of Supported and Unsupported Pd and Ni Catalysts Claudia AMORIM 1 Xiaodong WANG Mark A.

Tel: +44-131-4514719; Fax: +44-131-4513129 1 Work conducted at the Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering, University of Kentucky, Lexington, USA; present address: Shell International Exploration and Production, Houston, Texas, USA Catalytic hydrodechlorination (HDC) is an innovative means of transforming chlorinated waste streams into a recyclable product. In this study, the gas phase HDC of chlorobenzene (CB) has been studied over bulk Pd and Ni and ((8 ± 1) wt%) Pd and Ni supported on activated carbon (AC), graphite, graphitic nanofibers (GNF), Al2O3, and SiO2. Catalyst activation was examined by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) analysis and the activated catalysts characterized in terms of BET area, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, H2 chemisorption/temperature-programmed desorption, and X-ray diffraction measurements. Metal surface area (1–19 m2/g), TPR, and H2 uptake/release exhibited a dependence on both metal and support. The Pd system delivered specific HDC rates that were up to three orders of magnitude greater than that recorded for the Ni catalysts, a result that we link to the higher H2 diffusivity in Pd. HDC was 100% selective over Ni while Pd also produced cyclohexane (selectivity < 4%) as a result of a combined HDC/hydrogenation. Bulk Pd outperformed carbon supported Pd but was less active than Pd on the oxide supports. In contrast, unsupported Ni presented no measurable activity when compared with supported Ni. The specific HDC rate was found to increase with decreasing metal surface area where spillover hydrogen served to enhance HDC performance. Graphical abstract Chlorobenzene hydrodechlorination rate over Pd was three orders of magnitude greater than Ni. Bulk Pd outperformed Pd/carbon but was less active than Pd on oxides. Increased rates were observed with decreasing metal surface area where spillover hydrogen enhanced performance.
