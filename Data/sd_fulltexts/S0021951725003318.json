Graphical abstract Catalytic Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of biomass pyrolysis-derived bio-oil is a critical step for reducing oxygen content in the bio-oil, before its utilisation as a fuel. In this regard, HDO of bio-oil model compounds have been investigated over numerous supported metal catalysts, but the role of support on the catalytic activity has been largely ignored. In this work, the reaction mechanism for HDO of phenol – a bio-oil model compound was investigated on Pd/Al2O3, Pd/ZrO2 and Pd/TiO2 catalysts. Comprehensive reaction map and energetics of the multiple reaction pathways for phenol activation to benzene and cyclohexanone were elucidated using first-principles Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The metal-support interface provides a unique site for the adsorption of the reactants and the intermediates, which alter the reaction mechanism and consequently the product distribution. Over TiO2 and ZrO2 supports, phenol adsorbs on the Pd-support interface with the phenolic O binding to oxophilic cation of the oxide support and ring carbon to Pd, thereby weakening the Caryl-O bond and facilitating its cleavage to form benzene. In the case of Al2O3, phenol adsorbs only through the ring carbon on the Pd, which results in ring-hydrogenated products like cyclohexanone. A microkinetic analysis revealed the direct deoxygenation pathway to benzene to be favoured over Pd/ZrO2 and Pd/TiO2, while cyclohexanone production via a phenoxy intermediate was favoured on Pd/Al2O3, in agreement with experimental results.

Pyrolysis of biomass to bio-oil is a promising strategy for obtaining fuels. Catalytic Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of pyrolysis-derived bio-oil in the presence of H2 is a critical step in improving the quality of the raw bio-oil to produce chemicals and biofuels. Bifunctional catalysts having metal sites – for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation and acid sites – for dehydration have been considered as potential candidates for HDO [1–3]. Catalysts synthesised by the deposition of metal nanoparticles on acidic supports are a popular class of bifunctional catalysts. In this regard, the HDO of various bio-oil representative model compounds on supported metal nanoparticles have been explored. Phenol is an important model compound, which is present in lignin-derived pyrolytic oils and is also an intermediate during HDO of different molecules. The HDO of phenol over supported metal catalysts has been extensively explored and the nature of the catalyst support was found to have a significant effect on metal nanoparticle activity and selectivity [2,4–25]. Mortensen et al. [18] investigated the effect of different supports on Ni catalysts and found that Ni/ZrO2 exhibited the highest catalytic activity compared to Ni/SiO2 and Ni/Al2O3. Cyclohexane selectivity of more than 80 % was observed over Ni/ZrO2, with less than 50 % selectivity over Al2O3 and SiO2. The authors claim the superior activity to be due to phenol activation occurring at oxygen vacancy sites on ZrO2, which enhance adsorption and weaken the O–H bond in phenol. Additionally, Ni/ZrO2 exhibits high rates for both hydrogenation of the aromatic ring and subsequent deoxygenation to produce cyclohexane. The effect of the support on the activity of Ni, Ru and NiRu catalysts for phenol HDO was also studied over Al2O3, TiO2 and ZrO2 [10]. Cyclohexane selectivity of 86 % and 55 % was reported over Ni/Al2O3 and Ru/Al2O3 respectively. The NiRu/ZrO2 shows 40 % selectivity at 70 % phenol conversion, while NiRu/Al2O3 shows 85 % selectivity towards cyclohexane at 95 % conversion. Cyclohexanol is observed only in the presence of ZrO2. The NiRu/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited the highest activity for phenol HDO. This was attributed to strong metal-support interactions, which enhance nickel reducibility and promote hydrogen spillover from Ru to Ni. Additionally, the higher acidity and dispersion of active sites on Al2O3 facilitate phenol conversion via both hydrogenation and direct deoxygenation pathways. The incorporation of 20 % HY zeolite into the Al2O3 support of Pd/Al2O3 catalysts enhanced the phenol conversion from 28 to 63 % [19]. This was attributed to improved Pd dispersion, higher surface area along with the bifunctional nature of the support. Ghampson et al. [23] investigated the effect of oxide supports SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2 and ZrO2 on supported Co catalysts for phenol HDO. The catalytic activity was found to be governed by the total acidity of the metal support interface while product selectivity depended on the nature of the acid sites. The activity decreased in order: Co/Al2O3 > Co/Al2O3-SiO2 > Co/ZrO2 > Co/TiO2. The lowest activity for Co/TiO2 is attributed to the formation of a thin layer of TiOx (due to strong support-metal interaction) which covers the active metal sites. In the case of phenol and cresol, oxophilic metals Re, Fe and Ru produce benzene while less oxophilic metals like Pd and Pt promote hydrogenated products [24–27]. The Ru supported on TiO2 exhibited high activity towards direct deoxygenation (DDO) to benzene compared to carbon, Al2O3 and SiO2 supports [28]. This unusual activity is attributed to the formation of oxygen vacancies (due to the spillover of hydrogen from Ru to the support creating Ti3+ ions) on which the hydroxyl group of phenol binds. De Souza et al. [29] studied the effect of support on Ni2P for phenol HDO using SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, CeO2 and CeZrO2. Unsupported Ni2P was reported to have 95 % selectivity towards benzene, indicating the Ni2P phase was responsible for DDO while support was reported to enhance hydrogenation products via the tautomerization route. The effect of support on the HDO activity of Pd-based catalysts for phenol HDO was investigated by De Souza et al. [9] for oxide supports like SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, ZrO2, CeO2 and CeZrO2. They proposed that phenol activation proceeds via the formation of a cyclohexadienone intermediate, which can either undergo successive ring hydrogenations to form cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol or undergo hydrogenation at the carbonyl group to yield 2,4-cyclohexadienol, which dehydrates to benzene. Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) experiments under reaction conditions reported a buildup of phenoxy and cyclohexadienone species during the reaction, thus supporting their proposed reaction mechanism. No correlation was found between support acidity and deoxygenation activity. However, DRIFTS experiments of cyclohexanone revealed a correlation between deoxygenation activity and the strength of interaction between the oxygen of the phenolic compound and the oxophilic sites. Hence, the catalyst activity and selectivity of deoxygenated products depend on metal-support interactions. TiO2-supported Pd was reported to have the highest selectivity towards the deoxygenated product benzene followed by ZrO2-supported Pd. Cyclohexanone was a major product of the remaining Pd-supported catalysts. These studies highlight the importance of the support in tuning catalyst activity and selectivity. The presence of acidic supports has also been shown to cause rapid deactivation of the catalyst due to the formation of carbon deposits on the surface. Carbon formation can be graphitic or amorphous and forms via polycondensation and polymerisation routes. The nature of the deactivation is a strong function of the type of molecule undergoing HDO. Anisole was reported to undergo severe deactivation compared to guaiacol HDO [27,30]. Carbon deposition was not observed on supported catalysts during phenol HDO, and the build-up of a reaction intermediate is reported to be a probable cause for blocking active sites [9], preventing further access of reactants to these sites. All the above-mentioned studies indicate that the activity and selectivity of supported catalysts for HDO to be strongly governed by the nature of the support. However, understanding the exact role of the support would require a detailed mechanistic investigation of the reaction mechanism over supported catalysts. In this work, we attempt to provide mechanistic and kinetic insights into the effect of the support on the HDO over supported Pd catalysts using phenol as a model compound. The presence of metal-support interfaces opens up several active sites and phenol activation is investigated on these sites. A microkinetic model (MKM) was also developed to explain the catalytic activity and selectivity of the supported catalysts. Similar models have been successful in predicting the catalytic activity of transition metals for HDO, but have ignored the effect of metal-support interactions [31–33]. Our kinetic analysis also identifies the primary surface intermediate which may cause catalyst deactivation due to the blockage of the active sites. 2 Methodology Spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed with plane wave energy cut-off of 450 eV and a projector-augmented wave method [34,35], utilizing the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) version 5.4.1. The exchange–correlation energies were calculated using the vdW-DF functional [36–38], accounting for the significant non-local interactions present between the transition metals and aromatic molecules [39–43]. Unlike materials with highly localized electrons like Fe or Ni oxides which require a DFT + U formalism, the standard GGA functionals were found to be generally suitable to describe the electronic structure in ZrO2 and TiO2 because their d-electrons are not strongly correlated [44–46]. The Brillouin zone was sampled using a 2 × 2 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack grid. The energy and force convergence criteria were kept at 10-5 eV and 0.05 eV/Å respectively. Gas phase species are optimized in a supercell of 20 × 20 × 20 Å. The (101) tetragonal ZrO2 surface was modelled as a 3 layer thick (6x4) supercell [47], while a 3 layer (8 × 4) anatase TiO2 (101) was considered for modelling the TiO2 surface [48], For modelling the alumina support, a 3 layers thick slab supercell of (2 × 2) gamma Al2O3 (100) surface was considered [49,50]. The upper two layers were kept relaxed and the bottom layers were kept fixed. Digne model [51] was used for gamma Al2O3 modelling and the optimized lattice constants were a = 5.62 Å, b = 8.46 Å, c = 8.12 Å, α = γ = 90˚and β = 90.59˚. The optimised lattice constants of a = b = 3.86 Å, c = 9.70 Å α = β = γ = 90˚ for TiO2 and a = b = 3.66 Å, c = 5.34 Å, α = β = γ = 90˚ for ZrO2, are in reasonable agreement with experiments [52,53]. The interactions between successive unit cells were avoided by introducing 20 Å vacuum spacing above the cleaved surface. A 13 atom cluster was chosen for modelling the Pd, based on a balance between computational efficiency and accuracy in capturing surface properties. Pd13 represents the smallest 3D cluster that retains essential catalytic surface features, including corner, edge, and terrace atoms. Prior studies have demonstrated that clusters of this size can adequately model key adsorption and reaction characteristics of Pd-based catalysts [54,55], especially for high-dispersion catalysts like Pd/TiO2 [9]. This cluster size enables the study of localized surface interactions while minimizing computational demands. The thirteen-atom Pd clusters are modeled considering different possible orientations [56] as shown in Fig. 1 . Different adsorption configurations of these nanoclusters on oxide support are investigated and the most stable support- nanoparticle system was selected for further mechanistic investigation (Fig. S20). Transition states were located using a climbing image nudged elastic band [57] (CI-NEB) and verified by locating a single imaginary frequency along the reaction coordinate. A conjugate gradient and RMM-DIIS quasi-Newton algorithms were implemented for geometry optimisation and transition state energy minimisation respectively. The Gibbs free adsorption energies, activation barriers and reaction energies were computed at 523 K, 1 atm and were calculated by incorporating the enthalpy, entropy and zero point energy (ZPE) corrections from statistical thermodynamics [58]. To facilitate comparison with existing literature [9,20] the free energies were computed at different temperatures and 1 atm pressure to align with actual reaction conditions. The choice of 523 K and 600 K was made based on their relevance to typical operational conditions in HDO processes, where elevated temperatures are commonly employed to enhance reaction rates and improve product yields. The two distinct temperatures analysis aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the thermodynamic landscape of the reactions under both moderate and high-temperature scenarios. Details of these calculations are provided in S1 in the Supporting Information. An MKM is designed to determine the activity and selectivity of the modelled supported catalysts using the CatMAP [59] code. This code implements a mean-field approach and steady-state approximations to solve governing differential equations. Three types of surface sites are included in the model- (i) Pd sites, (ii) interface sites of Pd nanoparticles and supports (iii) support sites (cation and anion sites). 3 Results and discussion Phenol activation on the supported Pd catalysts results in the formation of benzene and cyclohexanone as the major products. The adsorption of phenol, benzene and cyclohexanone was investigated on the different adsorption sites (explained in methodology) of supported Pd surfaces and the most stable configurations shown in Fig. 2 . Phenol binds strongly on Pd/ZrO2 and Pd/Al2O3 with a Gibbs free binding energy of −0.45 eV and slightly weaker on the Pd/TiO2 with a Gibbs free binding energy of −0.26 eV. Although phenol binds with the same adsorption strength on Pd/ZrO2 and Pd/Al2O3, it binds to the metal-support interface on the former and on the Pd sites on the latter. In contrast, benzene binds strongly on Pd/TiO2 followed by Pd/ZrO2 and Pd/Al2O3 with Gibbs free binding energies of −0.57, −0.06 and 0.29 eV, respectively. Cyclohexanone binds with similar adsorption strength of −0.77 eV on Pd/ZrO2 and Pd/Al2O3 surfaces and slightly lower on the Pd/TiO2 surface. Cyclohexanone binds to the cation of support on Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/ZrO2, while it binds at the interface on Pd/TiO2. To understand the binding strength and geometry of phenol adsorption on Pd-supported catalysts, Bader charge analysis was performed to examine the charge transfer between Pd/support and phenol. The aromatic ring of phenol binds to two Pd atoms on all catalyst surfaces. Among the studied supports, Pd/Al2O3 exhibits the highest charge transfer from Pd to the aromatic ring (0.097e, 0.128e), followed by Pd/TiO2 (0.047e, 0.112e) and Pd/ZrO2 (0.036e, 0.033e). This strong upward shift in the d-band center with respect to Fermi level observed on Pd/Al2O3 leads to a stronger binding energy of phenol. Similarly, the phenolic O withdraws 0.089e from Zr, compared to only 0.015e from Ti. In contrast, there is no significant electron donation on Pd/Al2O3. This suggests that on Pd/Al2O3, the phenolic OH withdraws electrons primarily through the aromatic ring from the electron-rich Pd, as Al3+(0.53 Å), due to its small ionic radius, does not facilitate electron donation. In contrast, on Pd/ZrO2 and Pd/TiO2, the larger ionic radii of Zr4+ (0.72 Å) and Ti4+ (0.61 Å) allows phenolic OH to interact with both the metal cation and the aromatic ring. Atomic H prefers to bind on Pd on Pd/TiO2 and Pd/ZrO2 surfaces and on the surface O (anion of support) for Pd/Al2O3. The species O, OH and H2O prefer to bind at the interface between Pd and support for Al2O3. O and OH bind to the Pd-support interface on TiO2 and H2O binds to Ti. On ZrO2 support all three species bind to the Zr. The adsorption of all the intermediates involved in phenol activation (see Fig. 3 ) was also estimated at the different sites and the preferred adsorption sites based on relative adsorption stability on the various supported surfaces listed in the “Preferred Adsorption Sites” sheet of the SI Excel file. In general, oxygenated hydrocarbons preferentially adsorb on interfacial sites on all supports, except phenol which binds to the Pd in case of Pd/Al2O3 and cyclohexanone which binds to support’s cation on Al2O3 and ZrO2. 4 Reaction mechanism of HDO of phenol on Pd/support catalyst The reaction mechanism for phenol activation on the three surfaces was explored by considering the reaction pathways shown in Fig. 3. Phenol activation can proceed via 4 different pathways: I. Phenol can undergo DDO to yield the phenyl species(a), which can either hydrogenate to benzene or combine with another phenyl to form biphenyl. II. Phenol can get activated via dehydrogenation at O to yield species (c) which undergoes successive hydrogenations to cyclohexanone. III. Phenol can also undergo dehydrogenation at C to yield (h) species which can react with (a) to yield 2-Phenylphenol. IV. Phenol can also be activated via hydrogenation at C to species (b) which can undergo further ring hydrogenation to yield cyclohexanol. The rate of the coupling reactions to form biphenyl and 2-phenylphenol is likely to be a strong function of the surface coverages of the species (a) and (h). Note that the phenol activation pathway was not investigated on all three types of sites (metal, metal-interface or support) separately. Instead, the activation of each intermediate was considered on the site on which it was most stable (see “Site Coverage” sheet of the SI Excel file). The Gibbs free activation barriers for phenol activation via the DDO pathway to yield species (a) were found to be 2.88, 1.26 and 1.18 eV on the metal site of Pd/Al2O3 and interface sites of Pd/TiO2 and Pd/ZrO2, respectively. The high activation energy required for phenol dehydroxylation on Pd/Al2O3 is attributed to its primary adsorption through the Pd site via the benzene ring, leaving the Caryl-O bond unstretched (1.36 Å). On Pd/ZrO2 and Pd/TiO2 surfaces, phenol attaches to Pd via the benzene ring, while the phenolic oxygen interacts with the oxophilic Ti and Zr sites, thus stretching the Caryl-O bond to 1.40 Å and 1.41 Å, respectively and facilitating C-O cleavage. Similar behaviour was also observed on Ru/TiO2 [60]. H-assisted Caryl–OH cleavage was also considered where a hydrogen on the surface oxygens attacks the hydroxyl group of phenol followed by Caryl–OH cleavage and water removal. The Gibbs free reaction energies for this concerted mechanism were calculated to be 0.11 eV, 0.11 eV, and 0.21 eV on Pd/Al2O3, Pd/TiO2, and Pd/ZrO2, respectively with activation barriers exceeding 2 eV. In contrast, the direct deoxygenation (DDO) of phenol has Gibbs free reaction energies of –0.62 eV, 0.23 eV, and –0.37 eV on Pd/Al2O3, Pd/TiO2, and Pd/ZrO2, respectively. The species (a) undergoes hydrogenation to yield benzene with an activation barrier of 0.82 eV and 0.69 eV on the Pd sites of Pd/TiO2 and Pd/ZrO2, respectively. Alternatively, 2 molecules of (a) can combine to form biphenyl species with competitive barriers of 0.81 and 1.25 eV on Pd/TiO2 and Pd/ZrO2. Phenol activation to the phenoxy species − (c) via the second pathway was thermodynamically and kinetically favorable with Gibbs free energy of reaction (activation) −0.37(0.73), −0.28(1.35) and −0.92(0.50) eV on Pd/Al2O3, Pd/TiO2 and Pd/ZrO2, respectively. This indicates the ease of phenoxy formation on Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/ZrO2. Ring dehydrogenation of (c) to 2,4-cyclohexadien-1-one − (d) also proceeds with moderate barriers of 1.35, 0.93 and 1.44 eV on Pd/Al2O3, Pd/TiO2 and Pd/ZrO2, respectively and is endergonic. In contrast, Caryl-O cleavage of (c) to (a) is kinetically unfavorable on all the surfaces with activation barriers of 2.29, 1.89 and 2.26 eV on Pd/Al2O3, Pd/TiO2 and Pd/ZrO2, respectively. Species (d) can undergo hydrogenation at C or O to yield species (e) or (b), which can further hydrogenate the ring carbons to form cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol respectively. Hydrogenation on the C is kinetically favored over O on Pd/TiO2 and Pd/ZrO2 (0.70 vs 1.88 and 1.30 vs 2.43 eV), while O hydrogenation is favored on Pd/Al2O3, (1.13 vs 0.69). The relatively lower barriers on Pd/Al2O3 suggest the possibility of cyclohexanol formation along with cyclohexanone. Phenol can also activate via the hydrogenation of ring carbon to species (b) with activation barriers of 1.08, 1.08 and 1.65 eV on Pd/Al2O3, Pd/TiO2 and Pd/ZrO2, respectively. This pathway is however thermodynamically unfavorable compared to phenol activation to species (a) or species (c), with Gibbs free reaction energies of 0.54 eV (Pd/Al2O3), 0.51 eV (Pd/TiO2), and 1.07 eV (Pd/ZrO2). In contrast, phenol activation to species (a) has Gibbs free energies of −0.62 eV (Pd/Al2O3), 0.23 eV (Pd/TiO2), and −0.37 eV (Pd/ZrO2), while activation to species (c) has Gibbs free energies of −0.37 eV (Pd/Al2O3), −0.28 eV (Pd/TiO2), and −0.92 eV (Pd/ZrO2). Dehydrogenation of phenol to form species (h) was also thermodynamically and kinetically unfavorable with reaction energies (activation barriers) of 0.40(2.11), 1.06(1.45) and 0.59(1.62) eV on Pd/Al2O3, Pd/TiO2 and Pd/ZrO2, respectively. In addition to the reaction steps in Fig. 3, the removal of surface O and OH species generated during HDO in the form of water (thereby regenerating active sites) was also investigated. O hydrogenation to OH occurs on the metal-support interface sites on Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/TiO2 with Gibbs free reaction energies (activation barriers) of 0.46(1.56) and −0.25(0.96) and on the Zr sites of Pd/ZrO2 surface with Gibbs free reaction energies (activation barriers) of 0.06(1.21) eV (Fig. S18). H2O formation via OH hydrogenation had Gibbs free reaction energies (activation barriers) of 0.72(2.03), −0.12(0.65) and 0.58(1.64) eV on Pd/Al2O3, Pd/TiO2 and Pd/ ZrO2, respectively(Fig. S19). The lower barriers for water formation on the TiO2 surface suggest fast removal of the generated O and OH species from the Pd/TiO2 surface. The energetics of phenol HDO on the different supports were implemented in an MKM at a reaction temperature of 573 K and an H2/phenol ratio of 20, and a total pressure of 1 atm. The reaction rates for the formation of benzene, cyclohexanone, biphenyl and 2-phenylphenol on the supported catalysts were obtained from the MKM analysis (see reaction rates sheet in SI Excel file). Experimental studies [7,9,20] on these catalysts revealed benzene to be the major product on Pd/TiO2 and cyclohexanone to be the dominant product on Pd/Al2O3. The MKM analysis revealed the overall HDO activities towards benzene formation followed the order: Pd/TiO2 > Pd/ZrO2 > Pd/Al2O3, in excellent agreement with experimental studies [9,20]. The turnover frequency (TOF) for benzene production was found to be 3 orders of magnitude higher on Pd/TiO2 compared to Pd/ZrO2 which in turn was 6–7 orders of magnitude higher than that on Pd/Al2O3. In addition, the Pd/TiO2 surface allows rapid activation of surface O and OH species to water compared to Pd/ZrO2 (see reaction rates sheet in SI Excel file), which results in higher surface coverage of O and OH species on Pd/ZrO2 than Pd/TiO2. At similar phenol conversions, experimental phenol HDO rates on Pd/TiO2 were also observed to be 6 times higher than that on Pd/Al2O3 [9]. The TOF of cyclohexanone production was highest on Pd/Al2O3 followed by Pd/ZrO2 and Pd/TiO2. The TOF for cyclohexanone formation was 7 orders of magnitude higher than benzene formation on Pd/Al2O3, suggesting a high selectivity to cyclohexanone on Pd/Al2O3 in agreement with the experimental observations. On Pd/ZrO2, cyclohexanone TOF is two times higher than benzene resulting in a cyclohexanone and benzene selectivity of around 68 % and 32 % respectively (from our calculations) which is in excellent agreement with the literature [20]. This occurs because the reaction rates for benzene formation (Phenol to species a) and cyclohexanone formation (species (d) to (e)) are of similar orders of magnitude (see “Reaction Rates” sheet of the SI Excel file) on ZrO2. In contrast, benzene TOFs are 4 orders of magnitude higher than cyclohexanone on Pd/TiO2 resulting in high benzene selectivity. Note that the calculated HDO rate on Pd/ZrO2 of 1.89 x 10-3 s−1 is significantly less than that on Pd/TiO2 of 8.80 s−1. This is in contrast to experimental observations where rates of a similar order of magnitude were reported. This is probably due to the sensitivity of the MKM to the coverage of species (c). A degree of rate control (DRC) [61] analysis revealed that the stability of species (c) significantly affects the overall TOF on all the supported catalysts. For example, stabilizing species (c) by 0.15 eV on Pd/TiO2 results in a reduction in the TOF from 8.8 s−1 to 3.22 × 10−1 s−1. Similarly, destabilizing species (c) by 0.15 eV on Pd/ZrO2 enhances the TOF from 1.89 × 10−3 s−1 to 4.71 × 10−2 s−1. The interfacial sites were found to have the highest coverage of phenoxy (species (c)) followed by 2,4-cyclohexadien-1-one on all the supported Pd surfaces. Over 95 % of interfacial sites are blocked by the phenoxy species. This is not surprising as the phenoxy species is quasi-equilibrated on the three surfaces. DRIFT spectra obtained for phenol HDO on Pd/Al2O3, Pd/TiO2 and Pd/ZrO2 have indeed identified the presence of phenoxy and 2,4-cyclohexadien-1-one on all the supported surfaces [9,20]. The accumulation of the phenoxy species has been proposed to be one of the causes of catalyst deactivation by De Souza et al. [9]. The TOF of 2-phenylphenol and biphenyl are significantly lower than benzene and cyclohexanone on all the investigated surfaces, resulting in negligible selectivity towards 2-phenylphenol and biphenyl. This is not surprising as biphenyl formation would require higher surface coverages of the phenyl species (a). The MKM model predicts low coverages for the phenyl species and hence a low rate of biphenyl formation. The low H2 dissociation barriers on the Pd surfaces allow for high surface H coverages which leads to preferential hydrogenation of the phenyl species to benzene. Similarly, 2-phenylphenol formation would require the formation of species (h). Phenol activation via ring dehydrogenation to (h) had the lowest rates on all three surfaces, resulting in low 2-phenylphenol yields. The effect of the high surface H coverages on the Pd predicted by the MKM was also considered by calculating the adsorption energies of key intermediates in the presence of a 50 % covered pre-adsorbed H on the Pd cluster. The adsorption energies were found to change by less than 0.11 eV suggesting the high surface H coverage is unlikely to affect the reaction energetics. The effect of reaction temperature on the activity and selectivity was also investigated and shown in Fig. S1 and Fig. 4 . An increase in the reaction temperature results in higher TOF for benzene and cyclohexanone formation on all the supported catalysts. On increasing the temperature from 523 K to 600 K, cyclohexanone remains the dominant product over Pd/Al2O3 with a TOF increase from 1 × 10−3 s−1 to 7.84 × 10−3 s−1, while benzene TOF increased by over 5 orders of magnitude from 4.6 × 10−10 s−1 to 1.27 × 10−5 s−1. This is in sharp contrast to only 2 orders of magnitude increase for benzene over Pd/TiO2 and Pd/ZrO2 at higher temperatures. This is observed as the rate of benzene formation is highly temperature sensitive due to the significantly higher activation barrier for dehydroxylation of phenol to form species (a) over Pd/Al2O3. An interesting behavior is observed on Pd/ZrO2, where a rise in temperature results in an increase in benzene selectivity from 32 % to 91 % and a sharp decrease in cyclohexanone selectivity. On Pd/ZrO2, phenol undergoes dehydroxylation or dehydrogenation at phenolic O to form species (a) –precursor to benzene or species (c) –precursor to cyclohexanone with rates of 1.86 × 10−3 and 3.95 × 10−3 s−1 at 523 K, respectively. On increasing the temperature to 600 K, the rates increased to 0.69 s−1 (370 times increase) and 0.11 s−1 (27 times increase) respectively. The higher activation barrier of 1.18 eV for (a) formation vs 0.50 eV for species (c) formation results in the former being more sensitive towards temperature. Our results indicate that the phenoxy species remains the dominant surface species even at elevated temperatures (see “Site Coverage” sheet of the SI Excel file). The strong adsorption of phenoxy on Pd/ZrO2 along with high barriers for further activation results in higher coverages even at elevated temperatures. Consequently, the shift toward benzene selectivity observed at elevated temperatures is due to a temperature-accelerated increase in the rate of DDO of phenol relative to its hydrogenation. The impact of H2/phenol ratio on the activity and selectivity trends was also investigated. On increasing the H2/phenol ratio to 60, a 6 % increase in cyclohexanone (hydrogenated product) TOF and a 0.94 % increase in benzene (deoxygenated product) TOF is observed on TiO2. On ZrO2, TOF towards benzene and cyclohexanone increased by 0.56 % and 3.87 %, respectively. Similarly, on Al2O3, benzene and cyclohexanone TOF increased by 1.87 % and 4.22 %, respectively. This is not surprising as a higher hydrogen partial pressure enhances the availability of surface hydrogen, thereby promoting hydrogenation steps. The overall selectivity trends remain qualitatively unchanged, suggesting that lower H2/phenol ratios may be used without affecting the product yields. However, experiments are typically carried out at higher H2 pressures to minimise coke formation on the catalysts [65]. In summary, Pd/TiO2 shows exceptional HDO activity and selectivity towards deoxygenated products like benzene due to its excellent DDO capability (Pathway I). In contrast, DDO is severely limited over Pd/Al2O3 leading to cyclohexanone selectivity (Pathway II). Both pathways are favorable on the Pd/ZrO2 surface to yield benzene and cyclohexanone, with DDO favored at higher temperatures. The MKM was able to predict the product distributions on the three investigated surfaces in agreement with the experimental observations [9,20]. The present study did not consider the effect of a hydroxylated oxide support which may result due to a spillover of atomic hydrogen from the metal sites [62–64] and remains a scope for future work. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support may change the stability of the intermediates and the transition states and directly influence reaction rates, thus refining the accuracy of MKM predictions. In addition, the presence of oxygen vacancies and their role in vacancy-mediated reactivity pathways have been well documented [66]. Our present work thus serves as a first attempt in developing a mechanistic understanding of the behavior of pristine oxide supports for bio-oil HDO and sets the stage for more nuanced models that include the effect of surface defects. 5 Conclusion The reaction mechanism for the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of phenol on Pd/TiO2, Pd/ZrO2, and Pd/Al2O3 surfaces was investigated using a first-principles based microkinetic model. A multisite microkinetic modelling approach was considered to capture the effect of the different types of sites present on the real catalyst surface. The MKM analysis revealed the HDO activity to follow the order − Pd/TiO2 > Pd/ZrO2 > Pd/Al2O3, in agreement with experimental observations. On Pd/TiO2, phenol follows a DDO pathway involving a Caryl-O cleavage to form benzene. On Pd/Al2O3, cyclohexanone formation is favorable and proceeds via a phenoxy and a 2,4-cyclohexadien-1-one intermediate, which was also proposed experimentally. Over Pd/ZrO2 both benzene and cyclohexane formation is favored due to similar reaction rates. Interestingly, our MKM model predicts cyclohexanone formation to be favored on Pd/ZrO2 at low temperatures, while higher temperatures favor benzene. The results from the MKM analysis provide key insights into the role of supports on the HDO activity of supported metal catalysts and will stimulate further experimental studies to understand the role of support on the vapour phase HDO of bio-oil. 6 Associated content Transition state images and TOFs for benzene and cyclohexanone formation are provided at 523, 550 and 600 K, 1 atm.

        "dc:description": "Catalytic Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of biomass pyrolysis-derived bio-oil is a critical step for reducing oxygen content in the bio-oil, before its utilisation as a fuel. In this regard, HDO of bio-oil model compounds have been investigated over numerous supported metal catalysts, but the role of support on the catalytic activity has been largely ignored. In this work, the reaction mechanism for HDO of phenol – a bio-oil model compound was investigated on Pd/Al2O3, Pd/ZrO2 and Pd/TiO2 catalysts. Comprehensive reaction map and energetics of the multiple reaction pathways for phenol activation to benzene and cyclohexanone were elucidated using first-principles Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The metal-support interface provides a unique site for the adsorption of the reactants and the intermediates, which alter the reaction mechanism and consequently the product distribution. Over TiO2 and ZrO2 supports, phenol adsorbs on the Pd-support interface with the phenolic O binding to oxophilic cation of the oxide support and ring carbon to Pd, thereby weakening the Caryl-O bond and facilitating its cleavage to form benzene. In the case of Al2O3, phenol adsorbs only through the ring carbon on the Pd, which results in ring-hydrogenated products like cyclohexanone. A microkinetic analysis revealed the direct deoxygenation pathway to benzene to be favoured over Pd/ZrO2 and Pd/TiO2, while cyclohexanone production via a phenoxy intermediate was favoured on Pd/Al2O3, in agreement with experimental results.",
