A CO yield of 95% was obtained from a stoichiometric feed mixture of CH4 and CO2, at high GHSV ( 60 000 cm3 g- i h- l ), over a reduced NiO/MgO with a weight ratio of 0.2. In addition, the catalyst had excellent stability, since the CO yield remained unchanged during 120 h. Compared to the reduced NiO/MgO catalyst, the reduced NiO/CaO, NiO/SrO and NiO/BaO catalysts had low CO yields and very low stabilities. The TPD of CO over the reduced NiO/MgO catalyst indicated a lower decom- position of CO to CO2 than over the other catalysts investigated, hence that MgO inhibits the disproportionation reaction 2CO ~ C + CO2 over Ni. The behavior of the reduced NiO/MgO catalyst is probably due to the formation of a NiO-MgO solution, as a result of the similar crystalline structures of NiO and MgO.

Introduction The conversion of CH4 to the synthesis gas (CO+ H2), which constitutes the feed for the methanol and the Fischer-Tropsch syntheses, is very important from an industrial point of view. The dominant commercial method employed to produce synthesis gas is the steam reforming of methane [ 1,2], CH4WH20 --~ CO+3H2 AH=225.4kJ/mol (1) This reaction has, however, several limitations: (i) a very high energy consumption, (ii) poor selectivity for CO and (iii) a high H2/CO product ratio unsuitable for * Corresponding author.

In recent years, many researchers have attempted to convert methane to syngas via the catalytic partial oxidation of methane [3-9], cn4+lO2 ~ CO+2H2 AH=-22.6kJ/mol (2) Although this conversion is only mildly exothermic, a small decrease in the CO selectivity due to the total combustion of methane, which is a highly exothermic reaction, results in a large increase in the reaction temperature. In addition, a high methane conversion coupled with a high space velocity produces a large amount of heat in a small region of the catalyst. Because it is difficult to remove this heat from the reactor, particularly from a large-scale equipment, the process becomes very difficult to control [ 10,11 ]. To achieve a high CO selectivity and more suitable H2/CO ratios, several authors proposed to reform catalytically methane with CO2 instead of steam [ 12-16], CH4+CO2 ~ 2CO+2H2 AH=260.5 kJ/mol (3) This reaction has also important environmental implications, since both methane and carbon dioxide are greenhouse gases which can be converted into valuable feedstock. Sodesawa et al. [ 17] studied the CO2 reforming with a stoichiometric feed ratio, over NiO, CuO and Fe203 catalysts, reduced with H2 at 500. They found that Ni supported on SiO2 exhibited nearly the equilibrium conversion and a high selectivity to CO. The other catalysts, CuO and Fe203, deactivated rapidly, due to carbon deposition. An improvement was suggested by Topor et al. [ 18], who recom- mended the use of excess CO2 to avoid carbon formation. Chubb [ 19] and Chubb et al. [20] investigated the CO2 reforming using an excess of carbon dioxide, with CO2/CH4 molar feed ratios of 3:1 and 5:1, over nickel supported on alumina. They observed the powdering of the catalyst for both ratios, with a rate of disintegration smaller for the higher one. While investigations regarding the cause of deactivation were not carried out, the authors [ 19,20] speculated that the growth of carbon inside the pore is responsible for it. The catalyst deterioration could be alleviated by activating the catalyst with ruthenium; however, a much lower conversion was obtained. No commercial catalyst is yet available for reaction (3), the main reason being the formation of carbon via the reaction CH4 ~ C + 2H2 AH= 90.5 kJ/mol (4) which, in the absence of steam, quickly deactivates the conventional reforming catalysts. A similar difficulty arises with the methanation catalysts, because the low H2/CO ratio generated by reaction(3) leads to carbon formation via the reaction 2CO ~ C+CO2 AH=-170kJ/mol (5) The carbon formation sequence for various metals, reported by Rostrup-Nielsen [21], is: Ni >> Pt > Ru. Ashcroft et al. [12] and Rostrup-Nielsen [22] demon- E. Ruckenstein, Y.H. Hu / Applied Catalysis A: General 133 (1995) 149-161 151 strated that one can not avoid carbon formation with CO2/CH4 ratios 1:1 over nickel catalysts. Ashcroft et al. [ 12] suggested an alternative strategy for CO2 reforming, which provided a CO yield of 89% from a stoichiometric feed of CO2 and CH4. The carbon deposition ( 'coking' ) was suppressed by using the platinum- group catalysts. Although the catalysts based on noble metals are less sensitive to coking than the nickel-based catalysts, it is worthwhile to develop improved stable and effective nickel-based catalysts because of the high cost and limited availability of the noble metals. In the present paper, a Ni/MgO catalyst with excellent CO yield and stability for CO2 reforming of CH4 is proposed. A comparison among the Ni/alkaline earth metal oxides is also made. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation The NiO/MgO, NiO/CaO, NiO/SrO and NiO/BaO (with a NiO/oxide weight ratio of 20/100) were prepared by impregnating the alkaline earth metal oxides with an aqueous solution of nickel nitrate. The obtained paste was dried at room temperature in air, then decomposed and calcined at 800 in air for 1.5 h. 2.2. Catalytic reaction The catalytic reaction was carried out under atmospheric pressure in a flow system. A quartz tube (2 mm inside diameter) was used as reactor. The catalyst powder (weight: 0.020 g) was held on quartz wool. The molar ratio of the reactant gases, with high GHSV (60 000 cm3 g- 1 h- l, unless otherwise stated), was CO2/ CH4 -~ 1:1. The catalyst was reduced in H2 (20 ml/min) at 500 for 14 h, followed by an increase in temperature to 790 at a rate of 20/min, also in H2 (20 ml/ min). The analysis of reactants/products mixtures was performed with an in-situ gas chromatograph equipped with a Porapak Q column. The yield of CO is defined as the ratio in the product CO (mol) CO (mol)-~-CO2 (mol)-FCH4 (mol) 100% and the yield of H2 as H2 (mol) CH4conversion ( % ) H2 ( tool ) + H20 (mol) in the product. 152 E. Ruckenstein, Y.H. Hu/Applied Catalysis A: General 133 (1995) 149-161 2.3. CO adsorption The exposed Ni metal surface area of the catalyst was measured by CO pulse adsorption in a quartz tube (6 mm inside diameter) at room temperature, assuming a stoichiometry of 1/1. The catalyst powder (weight: 0.25 g) was held on quartz wool and its reduction was carried as described above. At 790, the reduced catalyst was purged with He (45 ml/min) for l0 min. Ultra high purity helium was used as carrier gas, at a flow rate of 45 ml/min. The analysis of gases during the adsorption of CO was carried out with an on-line mass spectrometer (HP Quadrupole, 5971 Series Mass Selective Detector) equipped with a fast response inlet capillary system. 2.4. Temperature-programmed desorption The temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments were carried out at a constant heating rate ( l0 K/min), using ultra high purity helium as carrier gas, at a flow rate of 45 ml/min. The analysis of the desorbed gases was performed with an on-line mass spectrometer (HP Quadrupole, 5971 Series Mass Selective Detec- tor) equipped with a fast response inlet capillary system. 2.5. X-ray powder diffraction X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was carried out on a Nicolet X-ray diffraction equipment, using the Cu Ka radiation, at 40 kV and 20 mA. 3. Results 3.1. CO2 reforming of CH4 over the reduced catalysts We examined the stoichiometric CO2-reforming reaction at atmospheric pres- sure, GHSV of 60 000 cma g- ~ h- 1 and 790 over a number of reduced NiO/ alkaline earth metal oxide catalysts. It was found that the reduced NiO/MgO was the best catalyst. Indeed, this catalyst provided about 91% and 98% conversions of CH4 and CO2 (Fig. 1), respectively, and yields of CO and HE of about 95% and 91% (Fig. 2), respectively. During 120 h of reaction, the conversions of the reac- tants and the yields of the products remained unchanged (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2), indicating that the reduced NiO/MgO catalyst has a rather high stability. Over the reduced NiO/CaO, the initial conversions of CH4 and CO2 were 67% and 86%, respectively, and the initial yields of CO and H2 77% and 65%, respectively. However, its stability was very low. During 8 h of reaction, the conversions of CH4 and CO2 dropped to about 11%, and the yields of CO and H2 dropped to 11% and 2.4%, respectively. The reduced NiO/SrO catalyst had lower initial conversions E. Ruckenstein, Y.H.

(CH4: 48.8% and CO2: 54.6%) and yields (CO: 51.7% and H2: 36.7%). The conversions and yields decreased after 50 h of reaction time to low values. The reduced NiO/BaO catalyst had no activity. The stabilities of the reduced NiO/MgO were compared at two space velocities (Fig. 3). We found that although the CO yield at GHSV = 253 521 cm3 g-1 h-1 was about 58%, hence much smaller than the one at GHSV = 60 000 cm3 g- 1 h- J, the yield still remained unchanged during 105 h of reaction. 3.2. C02 reforming of CH4 over unreduced catalysts The CO2 reforming of CH4 was carried out previously only over unreduced catalysts [ 12-16]. For comparison purposes, the reaction was also carried out by 154 E. Ruckenstein, Y.H. Hu / Applied Catalysis A: General 133 (1995) 149-161 100 90 80 lff oo 70 60 50 30 20 10 0 .......

Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 show that the unreduced NiO/MgO, NiO/SrO and NiO/BaO catalysts have very low activities. Over the unreduced NiO/CaO catalyst, the initial conversions of CH4 and CO2 were 51% and 62%, respectively, and the initial yields of CO and H2 56% and 37%, respectively; the conversions of reactants and the yields of products first increase with time and then decrease. 3.3.

The metal surface areas of reduced NiO/SrO and reduced NiO/BaO were rather small because the supports sintered at the high temperature of 790. The advanced sintering of SrO and BaO could be observed directly. 3.4. CO temperature-programmed desorption CO TPD was carried out to investigate the dissociation ability of the catalysts for CO. Fig. 6 shows that the reduced NiO/MgO, NiO/CaO and NiO/SrO catalysts have very similar TPD curves. There are two groups of overlapping peaks: at low temperatures ( < 260), and at high temperatures ( > 300). In the overlapping peaks at low temperatures, only CO is present, whereas in the overlapping peaks at high temperatures, both CO and CO2 are detected. Compared with the reduced NiO/CaO and NiO/SrO, the NiO/MgO catalyst exhibits a much smaller dispro- portionation of CO at high temperatures. 4. Discussion The reduced NiO/MgO provides very high conversions of CH4 and CO2 and yields of CO and H2. Hence this catalyst activates very well both CH4 and CO2. In the previously investigated Ni supported on A1203 and CaO [ 12,22], the deacti- vation via carbon formation could not be avoided. In contrast, the conversion and selectivity over the reduced NiO/MgO catalyst employed by us remained unchan- ged for 120 h, implying that the catalyst has rather high stability. In other words, the carbon formation, resulting in deactivation, is avoided over the reduced NiO/ 156 E. Ruckenstein, Y.H.

The carbon formation is mainly a result of two reactions: CH4 dissociation and CO disproportionation (2CO --* C + CO2). The TPD results showed that the reduced NiO/MgO produces a much smaller amount of CO2 from CO than the reduced NiO/CaO and NiO/SrO do; this implies that the high stability of the NiO/ MgO is at least partially due to the inhibition of the disproportionation reaction of CO. NiO, MgO, CaO, and SrO are face-centered cubic type oxides; however, only MgO has the lattice parameter and bond distance close to those of NiO (Table 2). For this reason, MgO and NiO can form a solid solution. This is also demonstrated by our XRD results which show that MgO and NiO/MgO have the same XRD spectra (Fig. 7). The formation of NiO/MgO solution has two important impli- E. Ruckenstein, Y.H.

Temperature-programmed desorption spectrum of CO over reduced NiO/MgO (a), NiO/CaO (b) and NiO/SrO (c). cations: (i) Because of the dissolution of NiO in the bulk MgO, the reduction of NiO to Ni occurs with some difficulty. This provides a relatively small amount of Ni segregated as small particles on the surface of the support. As a result, little sintering occurs. The low sintering is even probably compensated by some NiO dissolved in MgO, which, being reduced by the hydrogen generated by the reaction itself, segregates at the solid-gas interface. In this manner, a self conservation of the exposed surface of Ni is probably achieved. Since NiO does not form solutions E. Ruckenstein, Y.H. Hu /Applied Catalysis A: General 133 (1995) 149-161 Table 2 Crystal data for BI type metal oxides [23] 159 Compound a (,~) A-B (,~) MgO 4.2112 2.11 CaO 4.8105 2.40 SrO 5.1396 2.57 BaO 5.5391 2.77 NiO 4.1946 2.10 with the other supports, it is more easily reduced and sintering of the generated Ni particles occurs. In addition, the other supports, particularly SrO and BaO, sinter tremendously. (ii) Because there are strong interactions between the small Ni particles and MgO, the donor ability (Lewis basicity) of Ni is decreased. The binding of the CO molecule to a transition metal atom proceeds via the donation of the lone electron pair of the carbon atom to the vacant d orbitals of the metal atom and the back donation of electrons from filled d orbitals of the metal to the vacant antibonding rr* orbitals of the CO molecule [24]. The electron donation to the antibonding orbitals of the CO molecule weakens the CO bond. However, the donor ability of the small Ni particles in the Ni/MgO catalysts, and, consequently, the ability for disproportionation of CO is reduced. When the amount of NiO employed is too low, a too small amount of Ni is segregated at the solid-gas interface during reduction. As a results, the activity of the catalyst is expected to be low. This explains the low activity observed by Yamazaki et al. [ 14] for 5.6 wt.-% NiO/ MgO. An excess amount of Ni formed via the reduction of NiO supported on the CaO makes the relatively large Ni crystallites to behave like bulk materials. This increases the ability of CO for disproportionation. The unreduced NiO/MgO has low activity, because NiO and MgO form a solid solution and only little (if any) NiO remains exposed as particles to the chemical atmosphere. The unreduced NiO/ CaO has higher activity, because it has free NiO exposed to the chemical atmos- phere. NiO in NiO/SrO and NiO/BaO catalysts could not be reduced because of the sintering of SrO and BaO at the high temperature employed. 5. Conclusion The reduced NiO/MgO is an excellent catalyst for the CO2 reforming of CH4. It has high conversions of the reactants and high yields of the products as well as rather high stability. The reduced NiO/CaO and NiO/SrO have lower activities and selectivities as well as very low stabilities. The formation of a NiO-MgO solution in the NiO/MgO catalyst is responsible for the very high CO yield and rather high stability. 160 E. Ruckenstein, Y.H.

Tel. (+1–716) 6452911/2214, fax. (+1–716) 6453822. 1 Permanent address: Department of Chemistry, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361005, P.R. China. The CO2 reforming of CH4 over reduced NiO/alkaline earth metal oxide catalysts was investigated. A CO yield of 95% was obtained from a stoichiometric feed mixture of CH4 and CO2, at high GHSV (60 000 cm3 g−1 h−1), over a reduced NiO MgO with a weight ratio of 0.2. In addition, the catalyst had excellent stability, since the CO yield remained unchanged during 120h. Compared to the reduced NiO MgO catalyst, the reduced NiO CaO,NiO SrO NiO BaO catalysts had low CO yields and very low stabilities. The TPD of CO over the reduced NiO MgO catalyst indicated a lower decomposition of CO to CO2 than over the other catalysts investigated, hence that MgO inhibits the disproportionation reaction 2CO → C + CO 2 over Ni. The behavior of the reduced NiO MgO catalyst is probably due to the formation of a NiOMgO solution, as a result of the similar crystalline structures of NiO and MgO.
