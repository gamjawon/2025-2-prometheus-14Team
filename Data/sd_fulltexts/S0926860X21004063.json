The addition of non-precious-metal is a promising approach to develop Pd-based catalysts for the direct synthesis of H2O2. Herein, we prepare W modified Pd/Al2O3 for enhanced synthesis towards H2O2. With fixed Pd loading, the H2O2 productivity show a volcano relationship with increasing W addition, and reach up to peak value for slice W content. It is found that W species in the form of WO3 existing on the surface of Pd particles. The small addition of W optimizes the ratio between surface PdO and Pd, which simultaneously augments the productivity of H2O2 and hinders hydrogenation/decomposition of H2O2. Nevertheless, excess W addition not only leads to overmuch metallic state of Pd species, but also impedes the O2 adsorption on Pd particles surface, resulting in a decrease in H2O2 synthesis. This work demonstrates the promoter mechanism of W and offers a promising strategy developing Pd-based catalysts for the direct synthesis of H2O2. Graphical Abstract ga1 Keywords Direct synthesis Hydrogen peroxide Selectivity W-Pd/Al2O3 Promoter mechanism 1 Introduction Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as an important chemical product, is widely used as green oxidative for selective oxidation of olefins, water purification, paper/pulp bleaching and medicine sterilization [1–5]. The current industrial process of manufacturing H2O2 is the traditional anthraquinone method, which is an indirect method by hydrogenation and oxidation of anthraquinone sequentially [10,6–9]. However, anthraquinone method has several disadvantages refer to complex synthesis process, high production cost, environment pollution and large equipment investment [11]. Recently, direct synthesis of H2O2 from hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) has attracted intensive attention for its unique advantages of simple process, energy saving and environment friendly [12–15]. Low productivity and selectivity, derived from the side reactions including the dissociation of O2 to form H2O, H2O2 decomposition and hydrogenation, is the main challenge for the industrialized application of the direct synthesis approach [11,16]. Recently, supported Pd catalysts have been identified as the most promising catalysts for direct H2O2 synthesis [17–22]. Unfortunately, Pd catalysts also promote the formation of by-product H2O, which greatly reduces the selectivity of H2O2 [23–25]. Reasonable introduction of another metal as the second or third composition into Pd catalysts can effectively improve the activity and restrain the undesired side reactions since the geometric and electronic effects [26–28]. However, most of researches have been mainly focused on the incorporation of noble metals, such as Au [28–30], Pt [31,32] and Ag [33–35] etc., to obtain the state-of-the-art catalysts, while also pushing up the cost. In this regard, the development of highly efficient Pd-based catalysts in cooperation of cost-effective base metals is more attractive. Non-precious metals, such as Sn [26,27], Sb [36], Ni [37], Zn [38], Te [14,39], Pb [40,41], etc., have been demonstrated to effectively improve the performance of Pd catalysts for direct synthesis of H2O2. These non-precious metals mainly existing in the form of oxides, presents geometric effect (block undesired edge/corner sites on Pd particle), electronic effect (modify electronic distribution of Pd) or even co-catalytic role accompanying with Pd. Recently, our group [42] reported a theoretical strategy to screen the potential auxiliaries for Pd-based catalysts toward the direct synthesis of H2O2, by which PdW bimetallic nanocluster was considered as one of the promising catalyst candidates. However, the relationship between improvement effect and the W addition amount, as well as the exact enhancement mechanism of W addition, are still unclear, which hinders the further development of PdW bimetallic system. In this work, we develop a facile co-impregnation method by using Pd(NO3)2.2H2O and Na2WO4.2H2O as metal precursors to fabricate W modified Pd/Al2O3 catalysts. By fixing Pd loading and adjusting the loading of W to tune the surface composition of the W-Pd/Al2O3, the W-amount-dependent-H2O2 productivity and selectivity in the direct synthesis of H2O2 were explored. The morphology, elements distribution, crystal phase, surface electronic states of W-Pd/Al2O3 catalysts were characterized in detail to reveal the enhancement mechanism of W species, by using multiple physical characteristic techniques including transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), O2-temperature programmed desorption (O2-TPD). This work provided a deep insight into PdW bimetal and might guide future development of other non-precious-metal-modified Pd-based catalysts for direct synthesis of H2O2. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalysts preparation The typical process for preparing W-Pd/Al2O3 can be described as follows. Firstly, γ-Al2O3 was dried at 110 ℃ for 4 h to remove the moisture. Then, 25 mg of Pd(NO3)2.2H2O, a certain amount of Na2WO4.2H2O (4, 8, 12, 16, 20 mg) and 200 mg of glucose solution were dissolved in 20 ml of deionized water. Subsequently, 200 mg of γ-Al2O3 was added in the mixture and the new mixture was stirred at 40 ℃ for 24 h. After that, the centrifuged product was collected by centrifugation of mixture at 8000 rpm for 5 min and followed by drying at 60 ℃ for 12 h. Finally, the products could be obtained through a heat treatment process at 950 ℃ for 3 h under the inert gas (N2) protection, as illustrated in Fig. S1 (in Supporting Information). As a control, the monometallic Pd catalyst (25 mg of Pd(NO3)2.2H2O) and the monometallic W catalyst (20 mg of Na2WO4.2H2O) were prepared using the procedure mentioned above. 2.2 Physical characterization The actual loads of Pd and W were measured via ICP-OES using an Agilent ICP-OES 725 ES. TEM images were obtained on an FEI Tecnai G2 F20 microscope at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV and 200 kV. HRTEM images, elemental mapping images and line-scan profiles were obtained on JEM-2100F (200 kV) microscope equipped with LaB6 filament and EDX attachment. Power XRD patterns of materials were measured on an Ultima IV diffractometer equipped with a high speed detector D/teX-Ultra and a sealed tube providing CuKα radiation at a scan speed of 10° min−1 from 10° to 90°. XPS spectra were recorded on Axis Ultra DLD Kratos AXIS SUPRA spectrometer equipped with monochrome Al-K radiation source. All the Binding energies (BEs) were calibrated using the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV as a reference. O2-TPD experiments were performed on Micromeritics AutoChem 2900. Prior to adsorption, 50 mg of the catalyst was pretreated in Ar flow (30 ml/min) at 300 ℃ for 2 h, and then cooled down to 2 ℃. Adsorbents of 10% O2/Ar (30 ml/min) were introduced into the system at 2 ℃ for 1 h, respectively. Afterwards, the system was purged with Ar for 1 h to remove the weak physical adsorption O2 on the surface. Finally, the temperature was ramped from 2 ℃ to 800 ℃ at a rate of 10 ℃/min in Ar. The total O2 desorption amount (a) is the semi-quantitative data given during the characterization. The total area of the O2 desorption peak (b) is obtained by integrating, and the integration range is 21–800 ℃. The O2 desorption peak area on Pd (c) is calculated with the integral range of 21–255 ℃. The amount of O2 desorption from Pd is expressed by a/b*c. 2.3 Catalytic performance test The reaction is carried out in a low-temperature and high-pressure batch reactor. The reaction system is composed of a H2 Gas Cylinder (content 5%, balance gas is N2), O2 Gas Cylinder (content 25%, balance gas is N2), low-temperature reaction bath, high-pressure reactor, gas chromatography, etc. The flow chart of the experimental device is schematically illustrated in Fig. S2. In a typical reaction procedure, the prepared catalysts (30 mg), CH3OH (56 g), H2O (29 g) and H2SO4 (98%, 0.15 ml) were added into the reactor, sealed in the high-pressure reactor, and pressurized by 2.9 MPa 5% H2/N2 and 1.1 MPa 25% O2/N2 respectively. The whole reaction lasted for 15 min at 2 °C and 4 MPa. The concentration of H2O2 in reaction solution and the content of hydrogen in tail gas were measured by cerium method and gas chromatography respectively. The evaluation for the side reaction including hydrogenation and decomposition of H2O2 on different catalysts was similar to that of direct synthesis, except that methanol solution containing 1 wt% H2O2 was introduced. H2O2 hydrogenation experiments were carried out in 5% H2/N2, and the decomposition reactions were fed into pure N2. The H2O2 productivity is defined as the moles of H2O2 produced per kilogram catalyst per hour. H2 conversion and H2O2 selectivity were calculated according to the following equations: (1) H 2 conversion ( % ) = H 2 reacted ( mol ) H 2 fed ( mol ) × 100 % (2) H 2 O 2 selectivity ( % ) = H 2 O 2 formed ( mol ) H 2 reacted ( mol ) × 100 % 3 Results and discussion 3.1 W-amount-dependent H2O2 productivity of W-Pd/Al2O3 W-Pd/Al2O3 was prepared by a facile co-impregnation method. Their composition could be readily controlled by tuning the amount of Pd(NO3)2.2H2O and Na2WO4.2H2O precursors. Specially, Al2O3 support pre-impregnated with Pd2+, WO4 2- and glucose was calcined at 950 °C for 3 h under N2 environment. Table S1 shows the actual loading of Pd and W in W-Pd/Al2O3 catalysts measured by ICP. It is indicated that the measured amounts of Pd are basically the same, which provides a batch of suitable samples for studying the effects of W addition. And according to the loading of W, the samples were named by Pd+ 1–5% W/Al2O3. All performance test experiments were repeated three times to ensure the accuracy of the test. The catalytic performances for direct synthesis of H2O2 in CH3OH/H2O mixed solvent were investigated. As indicated in Fig. 1a, the H2O2 productivity on Pd/Al2O3 without W species is 67.1 molH2O2 kgcat −1 h−1. With the continuous increase of W loading, the H2O2 productivity shows volcanic trends. When the W loading adjust to 1%, the H2O2 productivity can reach up to 125.3 molH2O2 kgcat −1 h−1. While, further increasing the amount of W would leads to the degradation of catalyst performance, and the H2O2 productivity of Pd+ 5% W/Al2O3 drop to 93.9 molH2O2 kgcat −1 h−1. Fig. 1b shows the H2 conversion and H2O2 selectivity on W-Pd/Al2O3. It is found that the H2 conversion gradually increased from 13.9% to 35.9% with the increase of W content, indicating that W doping is beneficial to the catalytic conversion of H2. However, the H2O2 selectivity reaches up to maximum of 59.1% as the W loading is 1%, and decreases with increasing W addition. Table S2 lists the H2O2 selectivity and productivity data of Pd-based catalysts in ever reported work. Although limited by the different catalytic reaction conditions and solvents, the composition-optimized W-Pd/Al2O3 catalysts in this work displays higher H2O2 selectivity and productivity than most reported catalysts. Above results suggest that appropriate amount of W species can greatly promote the formation of H2O2 during the catalytic reaction on Pd surfaces. In order to reveal the behavior of the catalysts in the side reaction, the H2O2 hydrogenation and decomposition reactions were studied in the high concentration of H2O2-methanol solution under H2 and N2, respectively. As described in Fig. 1c, the hydrogenation and decomposition of H2O2 in Pd/Al2O3 are 880.0 molH2O2 kgcat −1 h−1 and 557.6 molH2O2 kgcat −1 h−1, respectively. By introducing a small amount of W into Pd/Al2O3, the H2O2 hydrogenation and decomposition rates were going down. When the mass loading of W is 1%, the hydrogenation and decomposition rates of H2O2 are 671.6 molH2O2 kgcat −1 h−1 and 210.1 molH2O2 kgcat −1 h−1, respectively, which are the lowest level among all catalysts. Notably, both the hydrogenation and decomposition rates of H2O2 decreased at first and then increased with the incorporation W species, suggesting the proper amount of W can effectively inhibit the H2O2 hydrogenation and decomposition. Despite of the H2O2 hydrogenation and decomposition, the formation of H2O for H2 and O2 is also a common side reaction. According to the previous investigation, when the conversion rate of H2 is under a low lever, the subsequent hydrogenation and decomposition of H2O2 could be negligible [43]. Therefore, the low conversion rate of H2 were achieved by reducing the amount of catalyst (10 mg) and the reaction time (4 min), thereby obtaining H2O selectivity data. Fig. 1d shows that the H2O selectivity of Pd+ 1% W/Al2O3 and Pd+ 5% W/Al2O3 are 78.8% and 77.1%, which are both lower than that of Pd/Al2O3 catalyst (84.7%). Above results further confirmed the effect of W-doping on the inhibition of side reactions and the enhancement of the selectivity of H2O2. 3.2 Promoter mechanism of W addition on W-Pd/Al2O3 The sample solely loading W (W/Al2O3) in Fig. 1 showed rather low H2 conversion and high H2O selectivity, leading to inferior H2O2 productivity to both pure Pd and other W-Pd/Al2O3 catalysts. It was suggested that may act as a spectator rather than participate directly as catalytic sites during the reaction, indirectly improving catalytic performance through promoter mechanism. In order to deeply explore the enhancement mechanism of W addition on the productivity and selectivity of H2O2, detailed physical characterizations of the catalyst were made. The morphology of W-Pd/Al2O3 was characterized by TEM method. Fig. 2a and Fig. S3 showed the representative TEM images in W-Pd/Al2O3 catalysts with different W content, presenting that the spherical nanoparticles are uniformly anchored on the support. As shown in Fig. 2b, the HRTEM image of Pd+ 1% W/Al2O3 demonstrated that the lattice spacings of the nanoparticles are 0.229, 0.199, and 0.166 nm, which assigning to Pd (111), (200), and (220) planes, respectively. However, the standard lattice spacing of the Pd crystal plane is 0.225, 0.195, and 0.138 nm, respectively. It can be seen that the addition of W expands the lattice spacing of Pd particles, which may be caused by the incorporation of some W atoms into the Pd crystal lattice. The Statistical measurements on particle size distributions of nanoparticles (Fig. 2c and Fig. S3) displayed that mean sizes of these nanoparticles are in the range of 17–32 nm, which indicates that the increase of W content can promote the dispersion of metal particles. To further analyze elemental distribution in W-Pd/Al2O3 catalysts, HAADF-STEM image (Fig. 2d) as well as corresponding EDS elemental mapping (Fig. 2e-h). It is found that Al and O are evenly distributed throughout the whole catalysts, while Pd locates in nanoparticle region. Moreover, it can be clearly seen that the distribution of W is divided into two parts, one part is concentrated near the Pd particles, while the other part is uniformly dispersed on the carrier. In addition, line-scan profile (Fig. 2i) of Pd+ 1% W/Al2O3 were obtained and the element distribution trend was in line with EDS elemental mapping above. The same element distribution was also observed in Pd+ 3% W/Al2O3 and Pd+ 5% W/Al2O3 (Fig. S4 and S5). The obtained results confirmed the formation of the W-modified Pd/Al2O3 composite structure. The representative XRD patterns of Al2O3, W/Al2O3, Pd/Al2O3, and Pd+ 1% W/Al2O3 are shown in Fig. 3a. Distinct diffraction peaks around 31.1°, 32.8°, 45.5° and 67.3° should be assigned to the γ-Al2O3 support. Distinct diffraction peaks around 40.1°, 46.6°, 68.1°, 82.1° and 86.6° should be assigned to pure Pd crystals with face-centered cubic (fcc) structure. The XRD pattern of Pd+ 1% W/Al2O3 is consistent with that of Pd/Al2O3, and no relevant peaks of W were detected on W-Pd/Al2O3 and W/Al2O3, indicating that W may exist in an amorphous form on Al2O3 support [44]. It was also found that there is no significant difference among the XRD patterns of W-Pd/Al2O3 with different W content (Fig. S6a), indicating that the amount of W added does not affect the crystal structure of the Pd particles. The surface composition and the chemical state of the elements in the W-Pd/Al2O3 were further analyzed by XPS. As shown in Fig. S7, the signal peaks of Al 2p, O 1s, Pd 3d and W 4f can be observed on the total spectrum of Pd+ 1% W/Al2O3. According to the integrated peak area, the atomic ratio of Pd and W elements can be obtained, as listed in Table S3. For Pd+ 1% W/Al2O3, the Pd:W atomic ratio obtained by XPS is about 1:1.61, which is much less than the atomic ratio (7.63:1) obtained by ICP measurement. The other samples have the same results, which means that W mainly exists on the surface of the W-Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. As shown in Fig. 3b, the detailed parameters of Pd 3d spectrum for all catalysts (Pd/Al2O3 and Pd+1%~5% W/Al2O3) suggested that Pd mainly exists in the form of metallic state (Pd0) and oxidized state (PdO), in which two intense peaks near 335.3 and 340.6 eV corresponding to Pd0 3d5/2 and Pd0 3d3/2, while the peaks near 336.7 and 342.0 eV attributed to PdO 3d5/2 and PdO 3d3/2. The relative content of each Pd species in the catalyst was listed in Table S4. The ratio of Pd0/PdO increased from 56.6/43.4 in Pd/Al2O3 to 66.3/33.7 in Pd+ 1% W/Al2O3 and then gradually increased to 77.5/22.5 in Pd+ 5% W/Al2O3 with increasing W content, which indicates that the incorporation of W species can protect Pd from oxidation due to its higher reducibility or oxygen affinity. Previous studies have suggested that Pd0 is the main active site for catalytic H2 dissociation, while the presence of PdO can inhibit the decomposition of H2O2 and increase the selectivity of H2O2. Therefore, a suitable Pd0/PdO ratio is the key to obtain the best catalytic performance [45–47]. The W 4f core level spectrum (Fig. S6b) displayed that WO3 species can be observed for both W-Al2O3 and W-Pd/Al2O3 catalysts. The characteristic peaks of catalysts around 35.6 and 37.8 eV are attributed to WO3 4f7/2 and WO3 4f5/2, respectively. In order to reveal surface exposed species of W-Pd/Al2O3, O2-temperature programmed desorption (O2-TPD) measurement was performed. According to Fig. 4a, there are three peaks in the test temperature range, which are marked as α (207.4 ℃), β (255 ℃) and γ (521.8 ℃). The desorption O corresponding to the α and β peak are derived from the O2 adsorbed by Pd particles and support Al2O3, respectively. It can be seen that with the increase of W content in W-Pd/Al2O3, the desorption peak areas of these two peaks decrease towards that of W/Al2O3, which means that W species disadvantageous for binging O2 covers the O2 adsorption sites on the surface of Pd particles and carrier. In addition, the γ peak correspond to the atomic O produced by the decomposition of PdO [48]. As the W content increases, the peak area of this peak also gradually decreases, which is consistent with the inference that the addition of W inhibits the excessive oxidation of Pd in XPS. As shown in Fig. 4b, the increase of W content results in more proportion of metallic Pd in W-Pd/Al2O3, and less amount of O2 captured by Pd particles (Table S5). To synthetically consider the catalytic performance and physical characterizations above, the promoter mechanism of W addition for W-Pd/Al2O3 catalyzed direct synthesis of H2O2 can be illustrated in Fig. 4c. With increasing W addition amount, more PdO are converted into metallic Pd, which is conducive to H2 conversion [45]. When a small amount of W is added, the productivity and selectivity of H2O2 can be optimized with a suitable ratio between Pd0 and PdO. However, excess W addition amount brings about multitudinous metallic Pd species on surface of Pd particles, which is disadvantageous for the productivity and selectivity of H2O2 due to the enhanced H2O2 hydrogenation/decomposition. In the meanwhile, most of active sites for the adsorption and hydrogenation of O2 towards H2O2 exposed on the Pd particles surface are gradually occupied by WO3, promoting the subsequent hydrogenation of O2 to water and accordingly reducing H2O2 productivity and selectivity. 4 Conclusion In summary, we prepared a W modified Pd/Al2O3 (W-Pd/Al2O3) with enhanced performance for the oxidation of H2 to H2O2 by a facile co-impregnation method. Fixed 5% Pd loading in catalyst, H2O2 productivity and selectivity were volcanically related to W addition amount. A moderate W addition (Pd+ 1% W/Al2O3) made Pd-based catalyst greatly superior to pure Pd (125.3 molH2O2 kgcat −1 h−1 and 59.1% vs 67.1 molH2O2 kgcat −1 h−1 and 34.8%). Detailed physical characteristics showed that the W species in the form of oxides (WO3) covers on the surface of Pd particles prevents the oxidation of Pd, which facilitates H2 conversion. The moderate addition of W optimizes the ratio of Pd0/PdO, enhancing selective hydrogenation from O2 to H2O2, and hindering hydrogenation/decomposition of H2O2. However, excess W coverage not only leads to excessive metallic Pd species, but also hinders O2 adsorption and hydrogenation to H2O2, resulting in a decrease in H2O2 productivity and selectivity.

        "dc:description": "The addition of non-precious-metal is a promising approach to develop Pd-based catalysts for the direct synthesis of H2O2. Herein, we prepare W modified Pd/Al2O3 for enhanced synthesis towards H2O2. With fixed Pd loading, the H2O2 productivity show a volcano relationship with increasing W addition, and reach up to peak value for slice W content. It is found that W species in the form of WO3 existing on the surface of Pd particles. The small addition of W optimizes the ratio between surface PdO and Pd, which simultaneously augments the productivity of H2O2 and hinders hydrogenation/decomposition of H2O2. Nevertheless, excess W addition not only leads to overmuch metallic state of Pd species, but also impedes the O2 adsorption on Pd particles surface, resulting in a decrease in H2O2 synthesis. This work demonstrates the promoter mechanism of W and offers a promising strategy developing Pd-based catalysts for the direct synthesis of H2O2.",
