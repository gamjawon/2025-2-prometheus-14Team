Experimental 2 1 Charactenzatlon methods IR spectral measurements were carned out m an evacuable IR Pyrex cell with Ca.FZ windows Pyndme adsorption expenments were performed as described by Occelh [8] The clay samples were ground to a fine powder, pressed mto self- supportmg wafers and mounted m the holder of the IR cell, evacuated at E 1 33 Pa, and degassed by heating at 400°C After coolmg the wafers at room temperature, pyndme was adsorbed m the samples The spectra were recorded on a Dlgllab FI’S- 40 interferometer. Adsorptlon/desorptlon expenments usmg Nz were camed out at -196°C on a Carlo Erba Sorptomatlc 1900 poroslmeter Pnor to each measurement the samples were outgassed at 150°C for six hours The Nz isotherms were used to determine the specific surface areas (S,) , the mesopore surface area (S,,,,) , the micropore volume (V,,,,), the mesopore volume (I’,,.,,,,) and the pore size dlsmbutlon of the samples Surface areas were obtamed using the BET equation The a-plot method was used to calculate the surface area of the mesopores, the micropore volume and the mesopore volume The unplllared clay (Detercol Pl ) was used as reference matenal [ 17-191 The mlcropore size dlstnbutlon was determined using the method developed by Horvath-Kawazoe [ 201 The X-ray dlffractlon spectra were measured with a Phlhps X-ray diffractometer using Cu K, radiation The samples were thm oriented films of clay mounted on glass slides or disc shaped pressed powders XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) measurements were made on a VG- ESCA 3 photoelectron spectrometer, using the Al K, and Mg K, X-rays for spectra excitation (h v= 1486 6 eV) Spectra were taken at room temperature on pressed wafers Curve fitting of the spectra was accomplished by means of routme program employmg Gaussian lmes Semlquantltatlve results were obtamed from relative peak area mtensities, after correction for cross-section values DTA and TGA analyses were made with a Netzsh STA 429 simultaneous thermal analyzer Air dned plllared clays were used for thermogravlmetnc analysis. The scan speed used was lO”C/mm to a final temperature of 900°C The catalytic tests were camed out m a tubular stamless-steel flow reactor mter-faced to a gas chromatograph (HP 5890) equipped with a flame lomzatlon detector The column was a 25 m Poraplot Q ( 4 = 0 53 mm) workmg at 135°C with a tamer gas flow of 10 ml/mm Water or 2-propanol were vaponzed mto the tamer gas stream (He) usmg a thermostated saturator In a typlcal expenment 500 mg of clay, placed between two layers of granular quartz, and a total feed of 27 ml/mm were used Ap( HzO) = 0.75 kPa and a p( 0,) = 5 45 kPa m the case of the propene conversion to acetone was used When the lsopropanol to acetone oxldatlon was studied, were used a p( 0,) or p ( N2) = 5 45 kPa and the p (0,) or p ( N2) /p (2-propanol) ratlo was 64 2 2 Pdlared clays syntheses The clay used m this study was a natural Na+-bentomte (Detercol Pl ) supphed by C Lavlosa SpA (Leghorn, Italy) with a CEC of 85 mequlv / 100 g All the chemicals were reagent grade and used without further punficatlon. Preparatzon of APB The bentomte pillared with alumina clusters was prepared according to a known procedure [ 71 a total of 15 g of Detercol Pl bentomte were suspended m water and allowed to sediment to remove carbonates and other dense lmpuntles by decantatlon The clay was suspended agam m dlstdled water ( 1 5 1) and stirred overnight at 55°C A total of 500 ml of an aqueous solution contammg 22 5 g of a solution (50% w/w) of 5/6 basic alummum chlonde salt (trade name Chlorhydrol, supplied by Rebels Co ) were added dropwise, under stmmg at 55”C, to the slumed clay The suspension was further stirred for 2 h at 70°C and then centnfuged and washed with water till total disappearance of Cl- ions (AgNO, test) The resultmg pillared clay was air dned and calcmed for a mmlmum of 18 h at 400°C Preparatzon of A FPB The preparation was conducted slmllarly to that described by Skoulankls et al [ 111 A total of 3 03 g of Fe( N03) 3 and 15 ml of Chlorhydrol ( 50% w/w solution) were added to 150 ml of distilled water and the solution was aged 17 h at room temperature The addition procedure, the clay punficatlon and the drying condltlons were similar to that described for the APB clay Preparatton of APB-Fe and AFPB-Fe The cation exchange was conducted slmdarly for APB and AFPB A sample of clay, (2 g) after calcmatlon at 4OO”C, was suspended m 30 ml of dlstllled water and treated under stlrrmg for 4 h with a solution containing an amount of Fe( N03) 3 9Hz0 correspondmg to 1 5 times the measured CEC of the clay The clay was then centnfuged, washed with water till total disappearance of NO3 - ion and dned at 60°C Preparatzon of ARuPB A total of 15 g of Pl bentomte punfied as described before are suspended m 1 5 1 of deionized water The suspension was stirred 24 h A solution composed of 22 5 g of Chlorhydrol (50% w/w solution) and 0 3856 g of RuC& 3 HZ0 m 200 ml of dlstllled water was aged 24 h The resultmg green solution was added to the clay suspension and the mixture was kept at 70°C under stlmng for 2 h The clay was separated by centnfugatlon, washed with drstllled water till Cl - ions disappearance ( AgN03 test) and oven dared at 400°C. 3. Results and discussion All the clays were characterized by chemical analysis, X-Ray dlffractlon, ther-mogravlmetrlc analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and nitrogen adsorp-tlon-desorptlon and the data are summarized m Tables 1,2 and 3. 3 1 X-ray dlffractlon The X-ray dlffractlon data of all the prepared clays are reported m Table 1 and some spectra are shown m Fig 1 All the clays showed a GoI peak m the range 1 75-l 9 nm, after a thermal treatment at 4OO”C, mdlcatmg that mtercalatlon and plllarmg of the polyoxocatlons had occurred The doe, peaks of the doped pillared clays appear less intense m compmson with the peak found for the alummum pdlared APB This finding can be kept as mdlcatlon of a less ordered and less stable structure This behavlour can be roughly attrrbuted to some disorder m the structure mduced by a plllarmg process mvolvmg ions of different dlmenstons generated by varying degrees of substltutlon by non (or ruthenmm) of the alummum atoms m the Keggm Ions The partial substltutlon of alummum m the pillars also appears responsible for the reduced thermal stablhty of the doped pillared clays The APB clay IS m fact stable up to 5OO”C, while the AFPB and ARuPB mterlayer spacing collapses at 450°C 3 2 Thermal anulym Fig 2 illustrates the dlfferentlal thermal analysis curves of selected pillared clays together with the curve of the Na+ -smectlte (Pl ) As found by other authors the pillared clays show two endothermic features The lower temperature endotherm corresponds to loss of water while the higher temperature endotherm, not observed m the curve of the parent clay, can be attnbuted to the dehydroxylatlon of the Table 1 Physlcal and chemtcal charactenzatlon of Fe/AI and Ru/Al pdlared clays RX (d&(A) cEC(mequ1v 1100 g) Fe (%)(w/w) Ru (%)(w/w) APB 189 14 8 006 APB-Fe 189 031 AFPB 180 129 2 26 AFPB-Fe 18 0 - 2 50 ARuPB 175 60 101 “All the samples were previously treated at 400°C 5 10 15 20 28 Fig 1 X-Ray spectra of selected pdlared clays 1 .

The process occurs at 300°C for the APB clay and at 400°C for AFPB and ARuPB For the last two clays the dehydroxylatlon process IS followed, at 450°C, by a rapld total loss of the basal spacmg, suggesting that the partial substltntron of Al m the pillars can induce a certam amount of thermal mstablhty m the clay structure, confirmmg what was found m the X-ray diffraction analysis 3 3 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ESCA spectroscopy was used with the aurn to obtam some mformatlon on the oxldatlon state of the Fe and Ru species contamed m the pillared clays The data are summarized m Table 2 and the representatlve spectrum of AFPB-Fe IS shown m Fig 3 All elemental peak positions were corrected for chargmg by assummg that the Al 2p peak IS located at 74 7 eV analogously to what was done with similar systems by other authors [ 211 All the rron contammg clays showed Fe 2p,,, peaks at 710 5 f 0 2 eV and Fe 3p peaks at 56 0 f 0 2 eV that can be attnbuted to the bmdmg energy of an iron oxide or to a mixture of non oxides [ 21,221 These values remamed substantially unchan- ged after the catalytic expenments, suggestmg the formation of stable Al/Fe mixed p&rs The Ru/ Al clay showed a Ru 3ds12 peak at 282 0 f 0 2 eV typical of oxidized ruthenium species, probably a mixture of oxides.

Lenarda et al. I Journal ofMolecular Catalysis 92 (1994) 201-215 dehydrogenation of Fe2 + /Fe3 + redox sites present in the natural sheet silicate glauconite was proved recently [35]. The APB clay, that contains a 0.06% wI w of iron, corresponding to the metal content in the octahedral layer of the starting bentonite, showed the lowest activity in air. As a result of the pillaring with iron doped aluminum polyhydroxy ions, the iron content of the resultant AFPB clay increases up to 2.26% wI w but the catalytic activity remains largely below that of the iron exchanged clay APB-Fe that contains only the 0.31 % wI w of metal. We can tentatively suggest from these data that the redox sites, created on the surface by thermal treatment of the metal exchanged clay, are much more accessible and effective as redox centres than the sites created in the clay octahedral layer or in the pillars structures by Al/Fe substitution. The higher reactivity of the Ru doped ARuPB clay is probably due to the well known strong oxidizing capacity of the ruthenium species. The reactivity in the propene conversion to acetone at 275°C follows the order: APB< ARuPB < AFPB « APB -Fe,AFPB -Fe the more active catalysts being by far the two iron substituted clays. The Ru doped ARuPB clay, that was the most active in the 2-propanol oxidation was found to be the least active in.the overall reaction. A possible explanation of this behaviour can be found by analyzing the catalyst behaviour in the 2-propanol to acetone conver­sion in nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. 9). The isopropanol dehydrogenation competes with the acid catalyzed dehydration to propene. The data for the propene formation for the representative APB, ARuPB and APB-Fe catalyst are reported in Fig. 9. It clearly appears from these data that the two unsubstituted clays APB and ARuPB are weaker acid catalysts. At this point, it can easily be understood why a strong oxidizing catalyst, such as ARuPB, results after all it is a mediocre catalyst of the entire reaction because of its low acidity. The best results have been obtained with the iron substituted clays APB-Fe and AFPB-Fe that are strongly acid and quite oxidising. Acknowledgements The financial support of M.U.R.S.T.

The alkali cations of some clays were successively exchanged with iron. The prepared pillared clays were characterized by X-ray diffraction, DTA, TGA, ESCA and N2 adsorption. The relative amount of Lewis and Brønsted acid sites was estimated from FT-IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine. All the clays resulted active catalysts for the vapour phase conversion of propene to acetone in the 150–350°C temperature range. The reaction appeared to occur via acid catalyzed propene hydration to isopropanol and successive oxidative dehydrogenation of the alcohol to acetone. The reactivity of all the prepared samples was correlated to the nature and number of the redox and acid sites.
