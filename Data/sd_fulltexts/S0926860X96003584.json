P. Gronchi*, E Centola, R. Del Rosso Department of Industrial Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, 32 P.za Leonardo da Vinci, 20133 Milan, Italy Received 18 June 1996; revised 4 October 1996; accepted 7 October 1996 Abstract The catalytic activities of Rh and Ni metals supported on SiO2 or La203 were compared at CH4+CO2 reforming conditions and performing catalytic tests and thermal analyses in thermodynamic conditions favourable for carbon deposition. The deactivation of both the metals deeply depend on the support. An increased CO production is obtained with lanthana but the comparison between Rh and Ni on carbon deposition base suggests that a positive effect could be reached only at low methanation activity. 1. Introduction The production of syngas through the reforming of CH4 with CO2 can substitute or implement the steam reforming process because the available CO/H2 ratio is more suitable for methanol or oxo-alcohols synthesis than that obtained by the wet process. The catalytic reaction requires the simultaneous adsorption and activation on the catalyst surface for both methane and carbon dioxide. The first is easily adsorbed and dissociated on metal like Rh [1], Ni [2], Pd [3,4] (CH4* = CHx * +H4-x*, (x = 3-0) while, at the same temperatures, carbon dioxide is adsorbed with difficulties on the metal [5]. The catalyst for the dry reforming reaction should contain base promoters or supports with the aim to promote a close contact of the reactants or their derived species [6]. In this paper we examine the role of La203 on the activities of Rh and Ni supported catalysts * Corresponding author. 0926-860X/97/$17.00 Copyright @ 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

As it was previously reported La203 deeply affects the selectivity of oxygenated compounds from CO+H2 reaction, owing to its base character and its affinity for carbon dioxide [7]. The aim of this work is to explore the role of La203 as support on the syngas production from CO2 and methane comparing catalysts based on metals of different activity. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts The Rh catalysts were prepared as previously described by Pessi and Bonvicino [8]. Ni catalysts (100-150 mesh) were prepared using incipient wetness impreg- nation techniques starting from nitrate Ni(NO3)2.6H20 alkaline solution of NH3 followed by drying at 383 K (24 h) and calcination (873 K; 2 h). SiO2 (Roth 0201; 100 mesh; 300 m2/g BET method), La203 (Fluka,Milano,Italy; La 99,98%; 9- 12 m2/g BET method) and 5 %La203-SiO2, obtained by impregnation of La(NO3)3 (Prolabo) solutions on SiO2 were the supports. Metal dispersion was measured by H2 static adsorption. All the freshly prepared catalysts were calcined and reduced with H2 before the catalytic tests. 2.2. Reaction apparatus A quartz tube flow reactor (10 mm in diameter, 400 mm overall length) filled with 200-500 mg of catalyst between two layers of carborundum, placed in a ventilated oven, with a thermocouple located inside the catalytic bed, was used. The flow rates of the gases (100 ml/min, CH4O2, diluted with N2) were controlled by mass flow meters (Brooks 5850). The concentration of reagents and products was determined using a GC (Dani 3800) equipped with a TCD and a Carbosieve S II packed column. Blank tests showed negligible conversions of the reagents. The discrepancy from 100% mass balance was ascribed to coke and tar formation. A direct measurement of the amount of deposited coke was made by an extensive hydrogenation of the catalyst to CH4 after each experiment in the 823- 923 K temperature range. 2.3. Thermal analysis A Mettler TA2000 system was used for TG. The analyses, on supports and catalysts, were performed under CO2+CH4 (1:1) at atmospheric pressure in isothermal conditions at 823, 873, 923 K with the H2 initial reduction and H2 final treatment (60 min He purge after each gas change).

Activity tests on rhodium catalysts The data of the specific conversions of the Rh catalysts (mol/Rh site x h) are reported in Table 1 at two CH4/CO2 feed ratio. The CO2 is consumed at a higher rate than CH4 with every catalyst. The apparent rate of disappearance of both reagents positively depends on the La203 content and the Rh(0.2%)/ La203 catalyst has the greatest activity, probably due to the high dispersion of the metal. The results show that the conversions of CH4 and CO2 do not significantly depend on feed ratio. At feed ratios < 1, the conversions obtained with all the catalysts have similar values [9]. The activity of each catalyst increases with the temperature and the order showed in Table 1 is confirmed all over the examined temperature range. With all feed ratios, at low temperature (723-823 K), the CO obtained on converted CO2 (see Table 2) advances towards 2 for the silica supported catalyst, but sets towards 1 with lanthana supported catalyst. At temperature higher than 823 K the CO/CO2 ratios come closer in the range between 1.6-2, depending on the feed ratio and independent of the support [10].

Gronchi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 152 (1997) 83-92 3.2. Activity tests on nickel catalysts Tests have been performed on Ni/SiO2 and Ni/La203 catalysts with a different metal content (30% and 4%) at temperatures of 823-923 K using a CO2/CH4---1 feed ratio. The CO2 and CH4 conversions (Figs1 and 2) are similar at low temperature but, when the temperature is increased, the conversions with the SiO2 support become greater than the La203 one. The CO2 consumptions are higher than CH4 ones on both catalysts; however, the CH4 is more preferentially consumed on silica than on lanthana support, as the ratio of CH4 converted to CO2 indicates [8]. 70 ~ 60 5O 40 20 10 0 i 540 560 Si02 /o A o 0 i i i i 580 600 620 640 660 Teamlaez atut e (K) Fig. 1.

The CO productions with Ni catalysts are presented in Table 3. In the same tests the activity decay with time and the CO/Ni value is the CO integral production in the first 100 min period. On silica with a low metal percent it was possible to run tests for a longer period than with the high metal content. On Ni/La203 a fast decay of activity was observed. The loss is greater with a lower metal content than in a higher one: at 873 K the time of activity half decay is 22 min with Ni(5)/La203 while it is 35 min with Ni(30)/La203. Considering the low metal content catalysts, the yield of CO on Ni atoms (surface + bulk metal) increases with the temperature while the selectivity index, CO formed on the CO2 converted, has an opposite behaviour on the two supports. Indeed the selectivity index has a low value (<1) both with the high Ni percent in silica and with the low metal content in lanthana. 3.3. Deactivation tests on rhodium catalysts Rh/SiO2 catalysts exhibit a very slight deactivation after 4 h of reaction with a CH4/CO2 ratio of 1 which is in agreement with the values predicted by Erdohelyi et al. [1]. The re-activation of the catalysts with H2, which was performed after each reaction at GHSV (apparent) of 1500 h-a, produces only traces of methane.The decay of activity of the Rh/La203 catalysts is reported in Table 4; it is shown that the 0.2 Rh/La203 quickly deactivates at 923 K. The catalyst was also partially regenerated in oxidising conditions with air at 573 K. The fast deactivation of the Rh/La203 catalysts was not entirely caused by carbon formation as, under H2 flow at the same conditions of the Rh/SiO2 88 P.

From the literature the SMSI effect occurs at the reducing conditions used in the tests. TG analyses performed in isothermal conditions (Table 5) indicate that at comparable metal dispersion the specific carbon deposition rate is 20-30 times greater in presence of lanthana than silica. All the curves are characterised by an induction time before carbon formation; this time decreases at high temperature and it is shorter with the lanthana than with the silica support. 3.4. Deactivation tests on nickel catalysts The deposited carbon on nickel catalysts was evaluated by the methane evolution during the H2 reduction reaction at 848 K after each test as previously reported; the generation of methane is greater from the SiO2 type catalyst at 873 K [11]. A very high rate of carbon deposition was observed at T-873 K and it was hard to perform analyses at reaction times longer than 100-120 min, owing to the crack of the quartz reactor. The carbon deposition was also measured in isothermal reaction/reduction cycles at the same temperature of catalytic tests by TG analysis; the results are reported in Table 6. The regeneration step is faster on silica at every examined temperature (max- imum at 873 K) than on lanthana; all the related curves do not come back to the starting level at the end of weight loss: the greatest difference between the starting and the final level is at 873 K while the lowest is at 923 K.

Discussion 4.1. Catalytic tests The addition of 5 % of lanthana on silica increases the specific conversion of both the reagents on Rh supported catalysts; the positive effect of lanthana is confirmed comparing the similarly dispersed catalysts Rh(5%)/SiO2 and Rh(1.5%)/La203. The 0.2% Rh on La203 catalyst shows the highest conversion among the rhodium catalysts probably due to the great dispersion of the metal; To explain the higher conversion of CO2 than CH4, RWGS reaction must be considered: CO2 + H2 ~ CO + H2OReverseWaterGasShift(RWGS) (1) The hydrogen can be supplied by the dry reforming reaction (DR): CO2 ~- CH4 ~ 2CO + 2H2DryReforming(DR), (2) or by the methane cracking: CH4 , C + 2HzMethanecracking. (3) The COobtained]CO2 converted ratio range from 2 (i.e. the stoichiometric value of DR reaction) and 1 (i.e. the stoichiometric value of RWGS). The low stoichio- metric ratios can be explained by also considering coke formation from CO dissociation COs + * ~ Cs + Os. (4) We have earlier found that CO~ increases at high lanthana load through CO2 dissociation on lanthana vacancies [10]. A CO/CO2 ratio=2 is possible only if the RWGS reaction together with the C deposition does not occur. Our results agree with the predictions of Borer and Prins which reports that La203 promotes the WGS equilibrium [12]. 90 P Gronchi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 152 (1997) 83-92 The CO2 conversion is always greater than the CH4 conversion with the Ni based catalysts and (Figs. 1 and 2) confirms the occurrence of the RWGS reaction similar to the Rh catalysts. In these cases the CO/CO2 ratio seems to directly depend on deactivation. With SiO2 the ratio is <1 for those catalysts which have the high metal load and undergoes a great loss of the activity due to the carbon deposition. On La203 also we observed that the CO/CO2 is <1 with 5% of metal on the support which is characterised by a faster activity decay than the 30% nickel catalyst. 4.2. Carbon formation We have then analysed the carbon deposition data (all the catalytic tests and the thermal analyses have been performed in thermodynamic conditions favourable for carbon deposition) with the aim of better understanding the role of lanthana as support for Ni and Rh metals in the dry reforming.The thermo-gravimetric results obtained with the Rh catalysts clearly indicate that lanthana increases the carbon deposition rate. On the Ni side the carbon deposition rate deeply depends on the metal amount and dispersion; thus on the high surface SiO2 the order is Ni(30)/SiO2>Ni(5)/SiO2 while on the La203 support is Ni(5)/La203> Ni(30)/La203. The comparison between the support shows that Ni(5)/La203 has a rate comparable to the Ni(30)/SiO2 (2-3 times less). To explain and better evaluate the behaviour of the catalysts, one must take into account the low surface area of La203: at the same metal percentage, a very different metal dispersion is obtained. As a consequence only Ni(30)/SiO2 and Ni(5)/La203 can be compared (1 10-3 and 510-3 g/Ni m2 respectively). On this basis at 823 K, the area specific carbon deposition rate is greater with La203 than with SiO2 (Table 7). The reaction which leads to the carbon formation (CO dissociation and/or CH4 cracking) seems to have different characteristics on both La203 and SiO2 because it rises earlier with lanthana than silica (see the induction times of the supported Ni catalyst). These results agree with those of the hydrogenation of the deposited carbon to CH4: we have found that at low temperature (773 K and 823 K) the amount of methane produced with the hydrogenation of Ni(30)/SiO2 and Ni(30)/La203 Table 7 Ni and Rh comparison by TG analysisa Catalystb Spec. dep. ratec Ni(30)/SiO2 0.2 Ni(5)/La203 0.3 Rh(5)/SiO2 1E-3 Rh( 1.5)/La203 0.

About the metal effect, we have found that the amount of deposited carbon on the Rh catalysts at same temperatures, is lesser than on the Ni catalysts. The comparison between the Rh and Ni catalysts by the area specific deposition rates of carbon show a less activity of the Rh ones at 823 K. The difference between Ni and Rh catalysts should be tentatively explained considering the activity of the metal in the CO dissociation. At this regard the relevance of this reaction in the carbon formation is enhanced by La203 support as it is known that lanthana with Rh promotes the CO formation in the CO2 hydrogenation at T<573 K [6]. Due to its basic character, the lanthana adsorbs CO2 which decomposes, at the border of the metal grain, through successive steps (from carbonate to formate species) to CO. Carbon monoxide then spills over the metal. Then the greater deposition of carbon on lanthana supported catalysts than on the silica ones could be due to the high CO concentration caused by lanthana. Indeed it is known that Rh catalysts promote the formation of C2 oxygenated from CO + H2 which involves the insertion of CO on a metal-alkyl bond while on Rh/A1203 the CO evolution takes place with greatest ease among VIII group metals [3]. Since on the contrary in the CO hydrogenation Ni is more selective towards methane than Rh, the great amount of carbon could be the consequence of the Ni higher activity in the CO dissociation than that of Rh. Our results agree well with Rostrup-Nielson and Bak Hansen which reports a kinetic effect related to the adsorption and dissociation of carbon monoxide. In addition a lesser reactivity of Cs, from the Boudouard equilibrium, than the CHx from methane dissociation with O. is reported [13]; the same carbon is more toxic than that derived from the methane [14]. 5. Conclusion In the methane reforming the addition of lanthana activates the CO2 dissociation CO2-~-* ) COq-Os. The data agree with a mechanism in which the rate of formation of CO and of its dissociation are significant in carbon deposition CO + * ~ COs COs +* ~ Cs +Os La203 enhances the extent of methanation by supplying CO to the metal. However, in the dry reforming a positive effect could exist when the metal has a low methanation activity like Rh, but a great C deposition and soot deactivation could be achieved by metal like Ni with a high activity in methanation. 92 P.

Centola R.Del Rosso Department of Industrial Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, 32 P.za Leonardo da Vinci, 20133 Milan, Italy ∗ Corresponding author. The catalytic activities of Rh and Ni metals supported on SiO2 or La2O3 were compared at CH4+CO2 reforming conditions and performing catalytic tests and thermal analyses in thermodynamic conditions favourable for carbon deposition. The deactivation of both the metals deeply depend on the support. An increased CO production is obtained with lanthana but the comparison between Rh and Ni on carbon deposition base suggests that a positive effect could be reached only at low methanation activity.
