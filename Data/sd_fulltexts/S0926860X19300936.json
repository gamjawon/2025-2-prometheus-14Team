Graphical abstract In dry reforming of methane (DRM), coke deposition on the Ni-based catalyst is the main cause of instability of the process. Perovskite LaNiO3 is a well-known highly active catalyst precursor for DRM, but the La-Ni catalyst derived from it is susceptible to severe coke deposition and thus difficult for practical applications. To improve its stability and activity, Co and Mn are introduced to develop a tri-metallic LaNi0.34Co0.33Mn0.33O3 catalyst precursor. The role of Mn is to improve the stability of the catalyst, whereas Co is an additional active component to increase the reaction rates. A strong metal and support interaction mediated by MnO is noted in the tri-metallic catalyst, which contributes to a synergistic effect of the tri-metals to sustain the high activity and stability under the harsh conditions of DRM. Keywords Dry reforming of methane LaNiO3 Co Mn substitution Coke formation Catalyst stability 1 Introduction Mitigation of carbon dioxide emission is an urgent global issue today to slow down the pace of climate change [1]. There have been immense research efforts worldwide to develop technologies for CO2 capture and storage (CCS) last three decades [2]. Yet, those past years have observed that storage of CO2 in a geological reservoir has significant drawbacks of the possible leakage, long-term liability, and unavailability of enough storage capacity. Hence, interest has been shifting from CCS to carbon capture and utilization (CCU) that can convert the captured CO2 into useful products such as fuels, chemicals, plastics, and alternative building materials. Some of these measures represent only a CO2-neutral path because fuels or chemicals turn to CO2 again upon combustion. Yet, to the extent that they replace fossil fuels and petrochemicals, they result in net reduction in CO2 emission to the atmosphere by reducing the consumption of the fossil fuels. Dry reforming of methane (DRM) is a promising route of CCU that converts carbon dioxide and methane into a synthesis gas (CO + H2), which is a versatile raw material to synthesize useful chemicals, fuels, and polymers [3]. The syngas is also used as a reducing gas of iron ores in steel-making industry [4,5] and a fuel for fuel cells [6]. (1) CH4 + CO2 2CO + 2H2 ΔH°1023K = 261 kJ mol−1 Nickel-based catalysts are most commonly used for DRM mainly for economic reason, but they have a serious stability problem, which poses the most critical barrier to industrial realization of the process. There are two major causes of instability of the DRM catalysts - metal sintering and coke formation [7]. Both causes are related with the high reaction temperatures (>1000 K) of this highly endothermic reaction. Sintering of metal is thermodynamically favorable under the reaction conditions and results in loss of active metal surface areas. Carbon deposition (or coking) also reduces the activity by covering the active metal surface and alters product selectivity. More importantly, operation of DRM could be interrupted by reactor plugging by excessive coke formation [7–10]. Thus, reactants cannot penetrate into the catalyst bed and instead are accumulated at the inlet side of catalyst bed causing additional pressure drop on the reactor, leading to eventual reactor plugging. Several approaches have been tried to minimize the deactivation of Ni-based reforming catalysts by sintering and coking. For example, bimetallic Ni-Co [11] or Ni-Mn [12] catalysts were reported to suppress the metal sintering. Small Ni particles exhibited better resistance against coke formation [13], and thus it is important to maintain small metal particles for stable DRM operation. Perovskite LaNiO3 was introduced as a highly promising active catalyst precursor for DRM because of their high initial activity [14]. However, the reduced LaNiO3 catalyst by hydrogen has a critical disadvantage of very low stability due to carbon deposition during the reaction. For the reason, researches on the material have been focused on suppression of coke formation [15–22]. Reduced LaNiO3 forms nickel nanoparticles on lanthanum oxide and a variety of strategies have been proposed to improve its resistance against coking by modifying A or B component of ABO3 perovskite structure. Modification of A (La) site improves oxidation property of the La2O3 support formed upon reduction of LaNiO3 [23]. Rare earth oxide support is considered as an adsorption site of CO2 that supplies oxygen atom to Ni sites where CH4 activation takes place. Thus, A site modification looks to improve oxygen mobility and CO2 adsorption ability of the support. The base transition metals are typically used to modify B (Ni) sites, which are responsible for tuning adsorption and activation of methane [24]. In spite of the significant progress during the past years, coking is still a crucial problem for LaNiO3-derived DRM catalysts. To improve the coke resistance and activity of LaNiO3, here we have added Mn and Co to synthesize tri-metallic LaNi0.34Co0.33Mn0.33O3 by a microwave-assisted Pechini method. The tri-metallic catalyst demonstrated high activity as well as excellent stability in continuous DRM operation. In a comparative study with various catalyst compositions, the role of Mn was determined to improve the stability of the catalyst by mediating the interaction between the active metals and the La2O3 support, whereas Co was an additional active component to increase the reaction rates. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation and characterization Lanthanum nitrate hexahydrate (La(NO3)3·6H2O) was purchased from Strem. Nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O), cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O), manganese nitrate hydrate (Mn(NO3)2·xH2O), and citric acid were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Lanthanum transition metal oxide perovskite was prepared by a microwave-assisted Pechini method. Equimolar lanthanum nitrate and nickel nitrate were dissolved in deionized water, and 3 times of metal moles of citric acid were added in the clearly dissolved metal nitrate solution. Ethylene glycol was added before microwave treatment in a 720 W microwave oven for 5 min. The obtained crushable polymer foam was calcined at 800 °C for 5 h. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was proceeded for 100 mg of sample loaded in a U-type quartz reactor. All samples were pre-dried at 200 °C under argon purging. Temperature was raised up to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 Kmin−1 in 60 sccm of 5% H2/Ar flow. Consumption of hydrogen was detected by a TCD cell. Carbon deposition was investigated by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The used catalyst was pre-dried to remove moisture at 200 °C for 1 h. Crystal structure of catalyst was determined by X-ray diffractometer (Panlytical, Powder-Xpro) with monochromatic Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 30 mA. Rietveld refinement of XRD pattern was performed by the X’pert Pro 3.0e program. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) images was obtained by using SU-8220 (Hitachi). Transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) images were obtained by using HR-TEM (JEM-2100 F, Jeol). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed by using ESCALAB 250 Xi (ThermoFisher Scientific). The BET surface area was determined from N2 physisorption at −196 °C by using a Mirae S.I. constant volume sorption apparatus. 2.2 Catalytic dry reforming of methane For DRM activity test, 100 mg of the catalyst was loaded in a 3/8 inch quartz reactor. Thermocouple was positioned on the top of the catalyst bed. Before the reaction, all catalysts were reduced at 800 °C for 1 h by a gas flow of 10% H2 in N2. The reactant gas feed mixture was CH4:CO2:N2 = 1:1.05:1, with N2 as a diluent and an internal standard for gas chromatographic analysis. The catalytic activity was tested at 800 °C and 1 bar with the reactant gas flow rate varied from 20 to 200 sccm. It was fixed at 60 sccm for stability test. Product gas was analyzed by a thermal conductivity detector of an Agilent 7890 gas chromatography. Conversions of methane (XCH4) and carbon dioxide (XCO2) were calculated by following equation, where CH4,in and CO2,in denoted mole flows of methane and CO2 in the reactant feed. Molar flow of each gas was calculated by nitrogen balance. (2) XCH4 = (CH4,in −CH4,out)/ CH4,in (3) XCO2 = (CO2,in −CO2,out)/ CO2,in 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Thermodynamic considerations The main source of carbon deposition during DRM is methane cracking [25] and, to a lesser extent, CO disproportionation (or Boudouard reaction) [26]. Like all industrial processes, high conversions of reactants methane and carbon dioxide are needed to reduce the energy cost of downstream separation and recycle processes. In Fig. 1 a, equilibrium compositions of DRM reactants and products are presented for CH4: CO2: N2 = 1:1:1 feed obtained by calculation of the chemical equilibria by using HSC4 Chemistry software provided by Outotech [27]. Practically meaningful conversions of reactants are possible above 800 °C. Since cracking of methane is the major pathway of carbon deposition under typical DRM conditions [28], its equlibrium was also presented in Fig. 1b. The cracking of methane is thermodynamically favored above 800 °C, where the main DRM reaction is also favorable due to both high reaction rates and high equilibrium conversions. In particular, when external heating is applied through the reactor wall to supply the heat of the reaction of this endothermic reaction, local overheating of the catalyst bed is unavoidable, which would accelerate the methane cracking and carbon deposition. Hence, we need to develop a highly coke-resistant DRM catalyst for stable operation. 3.2 Physical properties of catalysts X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted to verify the synthesized perovskite structures. The obtained XRD patterns of the calcined samples in Figure S1 of Supporting information (SI) are consistent with the orthorhombic LaNiO3 (LNO) perovskite structure. XRD peaks of Mn and Co-substituted catalysts, i.e. LaNi0.5Co0.5O3 (LNCO), LaNi0.34Co0.33Mn0.33O3 (LNCMO), LaNi0.5Mn0.5O3 (LNMO) also show the same perovskite structure, but their positions are slightly shifted to smaller 2θ angles. It indicates that Co and Mn are well-substituted into the LaNiO3 perovskite crystal lattice and that the lattice is expanded by the substitution as in Table S1 of SI, which lists lattice parameters obtained by Rietveld refinement. The lattice parameters of LaNi0.5Mn0.5O3 > LaNi0.34Co0.33Mn0.33O3 > LaNi0.5Co0.5O3 > LaNiO3 are consistent with their relative ionic radii of Mn3+ > Co3+ > Ni3+. Because of the high temperature calcination and reduction at 800 °C, the BET surface areas determined from N2-physisorption at liquid N2 temperature were very small (5-9 m2 g−1) as summarized in Table S1. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms in Figure S2 of all samples showed a typical type II isotherm, indicating the presence of a small amount of mesopores n the prepared catalysts. The surface electronic states of the catalyst precursors were also analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Since binding energies of Ni 2p3/2 and La 3d3/2 are overlapped, only O1s spectra are presented in Fig. 2 . The first peak positioned at 528–529 eV can be ascribed to a lattice O2− anion and the other peak at 531.18 eV to surface adsorbed oxygen [29]. The oxide peak shifts to higher energies by introduction of other metals, while the surface oxygen peaks remain at the same binding energy position. Thus, XPS results suggest the reducibility of perovskites as follows: LaNiO3 > LaNi0.5Co0.5O3 > LaNi0.34Co0.33Mn0.33O3 > LaNi0.5Mn0.5O3. 3.3 Dry reforming of methane The DRM reaction was carried out in a quartz flow reactor at 800 °C with 100 mg of reduced catalysts at 800 °C with a reactant gas mixture of CH4:CO2:N2 = 1 :1.05 :1 (GHSV = 12,000 ml/gcath). Fig. 3 a shows conversion-time profiles for prepared catalysts. The base LaNiO3-derived catalyst (LNO) shows initially high CO2 and CH4 conversions, but they rapidly decrease with reaction time. This behavior is consistent with previous reports on this catalyst [15–22]. Simultaneously, the reactor exhibited extreme pressure drop after 2 h and finally reactor plugging was observed at 11 h on stream. Conversion of CO2 was higher than that of CH4 on this catalyst, indicating that the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction occurs between CO2 and H2. Bimetallic LaNi0.5Co0.5O3-derived catalyst shows higher conversions and much better stability initially, but it also shows sudden reactor plugging at 12 h. Tri-metallic LaNi0.34Co0.33Mn0.33O3-derived catalyst exhibits the highest conversions and highly stable catalytic performance without any indication of deactivation or pressure drop. There is not much difference between conversions of CH4 and CO2 for the stable catalysts. Fig. 3b presents H2/CO ratios of the product observed during the DRM reaction. The H2/CO ratios of all the catalysts are higher than 1.0, indicating that side reactions that raise the ratio are significant such as methane cracking (CH4 → C + 2H2), Boudouard reaction (2CO → C + CO2), and secondary steam reforming (CH4 + H2O → CO + 3H2) with H2O generated from RWGS reaction. The highest H2/CO ratio is observed for LaNi0.34Co0.33Mn0.33O3-derived catalyst, which is most active and most stable as well. It indicates the smallest extent of RWGS due to the lowest concentration of unreacted CO2 over this most active catalyst. After 14 h of continuous reaction, the reaction was stopped and the catalysts were characterized. The SEM images in Fig. 4 show that monometallic LNO and bimetallic LNCO catalysts are completely covered by filamentous carbon after the reaction. However, used tri-metallic LNCMO catalyst shows clean and porous surface morphology exactly like the fresh catalyst. TEM images in Fig. 5 provide essentially the same information. The stable LNCMO catalyst shows unaltered morphology of both fresh and used catalysts. In contrast, fibrous carbon was well grown covering used LNO and LNCO catalysts. The amount of deposited coke was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of used catalysts in air flow. As shown in Figure S5, no weight loss was observed for the tri-metallic LNCMO catalyst, indicative of no coke deposition. In contrast, used LNO and LNCO catalysts show similar weight losses of ˜75 wt% due to the combustion of deposited carbon. However, the LNCO catalyst exhibited better coke resistance in the GHSV variation experiments summarized in Table S2. Reactor plugging was observed for LNO when GHSV was increased to 24,000 ml/gcath. But LNCO showed only a severe pressure drop at GHSV of 60,000 ml/gcath without plugging. The Mn-containing LNCMO and LNMO catalysts show neither pressure drop nor plugging. In any case, the large amount of carbon deposition is characteristic of LaNiO3-derived DRM catalysts as reported already [30]. But we found that the carbon deposition could be suppressed somewhat by introducing Co, and almost completely by making a Ni-Co-Mn trimetallic catalyst. It is well established how the coke formation influences the activity and stability of DRM reaction. Thus, the carbon blocks pores and hinders gas diffusion into the active sites of the catalyst particle. When the carbon formation becomes excessive, it also blocks interparticle space of the catalyst bed, leading to severe pressure drop and finally to the reactor plugging. Introduction of Co into the LNO catalyst increases the activity with only a small effect on coke formation. However, introduction of Mn is responsible for almost complete suppression of coke formation. In particular, by introducing both Co and Mn, synergistic improvement of both activity and stability could be realized. In order to elucidate different behaviors of the catalysts depending on their compositions, we have performed additional characterization. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) profiles of catalyst precursors are presented in Fig. 6 . Perovskite LaNiO3 shows two reduction peaks near 300 °C and 450 °C, which are consistent with two-step reduction of LaNiO3 through a La2Ni2O5 intermediate to metallic Ni and La2O3 [31]. Introduction of Co makes a ˜50 °C shift of the second reduction peak to a higher temperature reflecting lower reducibilty of LNCO. Introduction of Mn gives low temperature reduction below 200 °C due to the reduction of Mn3+ to Mn2+ in LNMO and LNCMO. Thus, decomposition of perovskite structure would start from the reduction of Mn3+ in Mn-containing perovskites. The Mn-containing perovskites also push the second reduction peak above 600 °C, and for the tri-metallic perovskite in particular to over 700 °C. To confirm the unique feature of reduction in the presence of Mn, only 10 mol% Mn-substituted LaNi0.45Co0.45Mn0.10O3 was prepared under the same conditions. Even with this small amount of Mn, the whole 2nd reduction peak is shifted above 600 °C. Thus, Mn component delays the reduction of Ni and Co components to metals, which is consistent with the largest electron binding energy in O1s XPS analysis in Fig. 2. Effects of MnOx addition onto Ni-based catalysts to suppress coke formation were well discussed in the literature [12,22–34]. Briefly, Ni particles are decorated by MnO patches to reduce their particle size as well as ensemble size. It also provides more sites for CO2 adsorption to supply oxygen species to the Ni sites, where methane cracking takes place. In the present case of reduced perovskite LaNiO3 catalyst modified with Co and Mn, Mn seems to provide related but more complicated effects. As evidenced by the results of TPR and XPS analyses, Mn as MnO strengthens the interaction of metals and the support, thereby delays their reduction. As shown by XRD in Fig. 7 , as-reduced LNCO and LNCMO show just well-reduced metals on La2O3 with the crystal size much smaller in LNCMO catalyst. The sizes of metallic Ni particles calculated by Scherrer equation were 17 nm for LNCMO and 24 nm for LNCO. Here is the first role of MnO to reduce the crystal size of active metals by a strong interaction with the metals. After DRM at 800 °C for 14 h, used LNCO catalyst shows that La2O3 has changed to lanthanum oxycarbonate (La2O2CO3) and Ni crystals have grown to large crystals. La2O2CO3 is readily formed by insertion of carbon dioxide into La2O3 during the DRM reaction [35]. In contrast, the LNCMO catalyst does not show La2O2CO3 formation and the Ni crystal size remains almost unchanged. Thus, another role of MnO is to stabilize Ni particles against their crystal growth and to prevent CO2 insertion into La2O3 during the DRM reaction, through strong interactions with Ni as well as the La2O3 support. In DRM, the support La2O3 serves as a CO2 adsorption sites and becomes a source of oxygen atom that reacts with carbon atom formed from the dehydrogenation of CH4 on the Ni (or Co) metal surface to form CO. Hence, it is critical to have a close contact between metal sites and the support to sustain the catalytic cycle of DRM. However, if coke formation becomes severe, metal particles are removed from the support by filamentous carbon as shown in Figs. 4 and 5. Then carbon atoms formed on the metal surface are not effectively reacted away because oxygen supply from La2O3 is physically blocked. Then the carbon atoms polymerize themselves and coking is accelerated. This is how the large amount of coke is formed, leading to eventual reactor plugging in DRM over Ni-based catalysts Hence, the close contact between metal sites and La2O3 support sites in DRM catalyst is an important requirement for high activity and stability because the CO formation reaction has to take place at the metal-support interface. The Mn-containing catalysts maintain such a metal-support interaction by suppression of coke formation. This mechanistic idea is depicted in Fig. 8 . Another evidence of the close contact of metal and support in the tri-metallic catalyst could be found in its ability of regeneration. Used LNO and LNCMO were oxidized at 800 °C for 1 h under air flow to obtain the original perovskite structure. As shown in Figure S5, oxidized used-LNO shows a mixture of La2O3 and NiO without perovskite formation. In contrast, used-LNCMO shows perovskite LaNiO3 with a small portion of La2NiO4 upon re-oxidation as shown in Figure S6. The result indicate that metallic Ni component and support component (La) were in a close proximate even under the completely reduced and working states of the catalyst. 4 Conclusions Dry reforming of methane was carried out over bi- or tri-metallic catalysts by partial substitution of Ni in LaNiO3. Especially, a tri-metallic LaNi0.34Co0.33Mn0.33O3 catalyst exhibited highly active and stable catalytic performance with little coke formation. The excellent performance may come from a close interaction between the metal components and the La2O3 support mediated mainly by MnO. It was observed that Ni particles were not separated from their support in the MnO-containing catalyst. The formation of CO takes place at the metal-support interface between carbon atoms from the metal sites and oxygen atoms from support sites. If the supply of oxygen is limited by the separation of two sites by coking, carbon atoms would polymerize to form more coke. Introduction of Mn contributes to stability by suppression of coking and Co contributes to enhanced activity, thereby both Mn and Co make a synergistic contribution in the tri-metallic LaNiCoMnO3 catalyst.
