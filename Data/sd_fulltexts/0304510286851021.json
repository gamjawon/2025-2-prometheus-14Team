Summary Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and X-ray absorp- tion near-edge structure (XANES) spectra were obtained for the Re L III edge for different loadings of ammonium perrhenate absorbed on alumina before and after calcination to produce rhenium oxide metathesis catalysts. In comparison with crystalline ammonium perrhenate, the spectra show that three-dimensional clusters of ammonium perrhenate exist on the alumina before calcination and at high loadings. After calcination, the spectra indicate that a perrhenate-like structure is retained for the calcined material. Low loading samples exhibit different spectral features which may indicate the formation of surface rhenium(VII) oxide clusters. Introduction Rhenium oxide on alumina is a well-known metathesis catalyst for alkenes and, when promoted with tetraalkyi tin, for alkenes containing func- tional groups[1,2]. A variety of techniques has been used to study the structure of the catalysts in terms of the dispersion state of the supported rhenium com- pound, the rhenium oxidation state and the location on the alumina surface of the rhenium and of the promoter [3 - 6]. Recent studies [7-9] have suggested that the ammonium perrhenate deposited on the alumina exists before calcination in gross three-dimensional macrostructures, whose properties are close to that of crystalline ammonium perrhenate, NH4Re04, even at the relatively low loading of 5 wt.%. After calcination, the supposed conversion to rhenium(VII) oxide, Re207, is accompanied by redistribution over the alumina surface, but these studies [7-9] revealed that considerable 0304-5102/86/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands quantities of rhenium oxide, if not the majority, remained locked in the meso-pores of the alumina and in the interparticle voids between the alumina particles. Subsequent work [10-13] contrastingly suggests that the dispersive effect of calcination is more widespread and fundamental, producing thin, extensive rafts or clusters of Re^O^, perhaps two- or three-molecular layers in thickness. The EXAFS/XANES technique is particularly well suited to the study of supported metal oxide catalysts, as structural information can be obtained for the absorbing metal oxide in its amorphous state as well as in the bulk crystalline condition. The work reported here represents a preliminary study of the EXAFS/XANES spectra of samples of NH4Re04 and rhenium oxide supported on alumina, whose metathesis activity and structural characteris- tics have already been described [9]. Experimental Materials \"f-alumina The 7-alumina used here was produced by grinding and sieving a Laporte ultra-pure crystalline boehmite and calcining a sieve fraction in dry air for 6 h at 525 C before use (alumina Al-L [9]). This Al-L possessed the following characteristics: surface area 157 n^g\"1; pore radius 6.5 nm; pore volume 0.47 cm3 g~1; 20 ppm Na. Ammonium perrhenate/rhenium(VI) oxide Supplied by Aldrich, with 99.999% purity. Typical impurities were 5 ppm of Si, Fe, Mg and Cu. Catalyst preparation Al-L was impregnated with NH4Re04 aqueous solution, as previously described [9], to produce samples with various loadings, designated as e.g. 15% NH4Re04/Al203. After calcination in dry air at 525 C for 2 h, samples were produced containing nominally Re2C>7, and designated as e.g. 15% ResC^/AliOa. These samples are listed in Table 4 of [9]. EXAFS/XANES Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and X-ray absorp- tion near-edge structure (XANES) spectra were obtained in transmission, using the Synchrotron Radiation Source (SRS, Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, England) with a beam energy of typically 1.80 GeV and a circu- lating current of between 186 and 110 mA. The transmission of the reference ionisation chamber was 90% and that of the signal chamber, 30% Spectra were obtained with essentially constant (75%) harmonic rejection by 69 using a double-crystal (Si(220)) order sorting monochromator. This tech- nique, coupled with the comparatively low energy of the SRS beam and the ion-chamber settings throughout helped to minimise the harmonic contam- ination of the transmission measurements. All samples were measured at room temperature in air, as finely ground powders, particle size approximately 1 Jum, as 1 mm thickness films en- trapped in Mylar. To achieve an optimum maximum absorbance of approxi- mately 2.2, samples were thoroughly mixed and diluted with boron nitride, whenever necessary. A rhenium metal foil, 10 fim, was used to calibrate the energy of the Re L III absorption edge at 10.532 keV (Si(220) crystal monochromator); crys- talline Re03 and NH4Re04 were used as reference compounds. Results and discussion The raw data was first processed using the program EXCALIB, part of the Daresbury suite of EXAFS programs, to convert the data based upon the Si(220) monochromator angle into normalised spectra of absorption versus electron energy in eV. Figure 1 shows the spectra produced via EXCALIB for the Cr metal foil calibrant and for the reference compounds ReC>3 and NH4Re04. The hexag- onal close-packed structure of Re metal produces. Fig l(a), a well-defined and regular EXAFS structure, from 50 eV to 1000 eV beyond the Re edge. Similarly, the well-ordered ReOa structure produces, Fig. l(b), distinctive EXAFS oscillations up to 400 eV from the Re edge, while the spatially distributed Re04~ moieties in NH4Re04, Fig. l(c), produce longer-wave- length EXAFS oscillation in the same energy region. The background-removed spectra, Fig. 2, were obtained using the program EXBACK, which itself uses the EXCALIB-processed excitation data as input. These spectra for Re metal and ReOa, Fig. 2(a) and (b), show the good resolution of extensive EXAFS structure achievable for regular crystal lattices. The EXBACK spectrum for NH4Re04, Fig. 2(c) reveals that distinc- tive EXAFS oscillations continue up to 1200 eV from the Re edge as origin. These 'standard' spectra will be used to verify, through the curve-fitting analysis of the normalised, background-free spectra and their Fourier trans- forms, the calculation of Re and 0 atom phase shifts and the application of the curved wave approximation. The normalised (EXCALIB) spectra and background-removed (EXBACK) spectra for NH4Re04/Al203 and Re207/Al203 samples are shown in Figs. 3 - 6. At loadings of 15% and 10% NH4Re04 on alumina, the spectra in Fig. 3(a) and (b) are remarkably similar to that of crystalline NH4Re04. Similarly, the EXBACK spectra of these materials. Fig. 4(a) and (b), are again almost superposable with that of crystalline NH4Re04, up to 700 eV beyond the Re edge. The relative amplitudes of EXAFS oscillations do show some differences from the crystalline compound, reflecting differences in the 70 112 116 EnergyI W2 aV Fig. 1. Normalised absorption spectra (EXCALIB) of reference compounds, absorption plotted vs. X-ray energy: (a) Re metal, (b) ReOs; (c) NH4Re04 local geometry of the Re species in the supported materials. At energies >700 eV, substantial shifts in the energies of the wave peaks become evident. In this preliminary report, and without the curve-fitting procedures, it is not possible to comment on the significance of the relatively small differ- ences observed. But the real and close similarity of supported and unsup- ported NH4Re04 EXAFS spectra does suggest that the crystalline forms of these materials are very similar. This observation is in accord with the con- clusions reached from previous studies using FABMS, nitrogen absorption and X-ray diffraction studies [9] and from recent TPR investigations[14]. After drying, the impregnated alumina appears to develop large, three- dimensional clusters of NH4Re04, which may be located predominantly within the meso-pore structure of alumina. 71 Fig 2. Normalised, background-removed EXAFS spectra (EXBACK) of reference com- pounds- (a) Re metal; (b) ReOs, (c) NH4ReC>4 During calcination of such materials, some workers suggest that during decomposition the Re^0^ becomes mobilised and transported in the vapour phase to exposed alumina surface. The resultant Re phase is therefore expected to be in a more highly dispersed state after calcination in air at >500 C[12-14]. It is therefore perhaps surprising that the EXCALJB spectra of 15% and 10% Re207/Al2C>3 materials, Fig. 5(a) and (b), are again remarkably similar to that of crystalline NH4ReC>4. Furthermore, the background-removed EXBACK spectra. Fig. 6(a) and (b), are virtually superposable with that of NH4Re04 up to 600 eV beyond the Re edge. EXAFS energy shifts again become distinguishable at energies greater than this value. 72 Fig. 3. Normalised absorption spectra (EXCALIB) of Re samples with various loadings of NH4Re04, uncalcmed, supported on alumina. Absorption is plotted us X-ray energy, (a) 15% NH4Re04/Al^Os; (b) 10% NH4Re04/Al203, (c) 2.6% NH4Re04/Al;203. The EXAFS/XANES spectra are a composite formation of the total Re and therefore represent the average Re environment in the sample. It is thus tempting to speculate that on this evidence, the Re in high loading samples remains virtually the same after calcination. That is to say, the Re is present predominantly as gross clusters of perrhenate-like species. Krebs et al. [15] describe the crystal structure of Re2C>7 in terms of strongly distorted ReOg octahedra and fairly regular ReC>4 tetrahedra connected through comers to form polymeric double layers, the double layers having only Van der Waals' contact with neighbouring layers. 73 Fig 4 Normalised, background-removed EXAFS spectra (EXBACK) of Re samples with various loadings of NH4ReC>4, uncalcined, supported on alumina- (a) 16% NH4Re04/ AlzOa, (b) 10% NH4Re04/Al2C>3, (c) 2 6% NH4Re04/Al2C 3, ( - ) spectrum for crys- talline NH4Re04 Although the ionic structure can be formally represented as Re031- Re04~, the molecular unit Re2C>7 is 'preferred' in the polymeric solid. In this event, the Re207 molecular unit would be assumed to produce at least one extra and large EXAFS peak corresponding to the nearest-neighbour Re-Re shell at 3.7 A in the spectra of calcined samples, if indeed the calcination of supported NH4Re04 was supposed to produce a supported and dispersed phase of Re207. At high loadings, this feature is not at all obvious, the spectra resembling that from the parent structure of discrete Re04~ entities. This conclusion is in some agreement with previous work [9] which concluded that for high loading catalysts, which were active in fatty acid ester metathesis, considerable amounts of Re remain locked within the pore structure of the alumina particles and in the interstitial voids between the alumina particles. Furthermore, the FABMS spectra [7, 9] strongly suggest that the perturbed Re^O-, species, which were evident at the surface of the materials, probably lay at the surface of gross Re04~ clusters, rather than 74 Energy I lO^aV Fig 5 Normalised absorption spectra (EXCALIB) of Re samples with various loadings of Re^C^ supported on alumina, after calcination at 525 C: (a) 15% Re^C^/Al^Oa, (b) 10% Re207/Ala03, (c) 2.5% Re^/A^Oa occurring as monolayer entities on the alumina surface. Nevertheless, it is expected that on analysis the distortions observed in the EXAFS spectra will yield the local geometry of the Re and confirm that the cluster layers are perhaps only 2 or 3 molecular layers in thickness [14]. Xu Xiaoding has suggested [11] that the supported Re species existing immediately after air calcination are different from those remaining after the calcined material has been exposed to moist air. It may be therefore that the high Re loading samples studied here have been altered during their exposure to the atmosphere both before and during the experiments. However, although a rhenium heptoxide dihydrate is known [16], the integrity of the 75 Energy/ 10 eV Fig. 6. Normalised, background-removed EXAFS spectra (EXBACK) of Re samples with various loadings of Re207 supported on alumina, after calcination at 525 C: (a) 15% Re207/Al203, (b) 10% Re^/AlzOa, (c) 2.5% Rest^/Al^Oa, ( ) spectrum for crys- talline NH4Re04. Re207 moiety is retained in the crystal structure, and the corresponding Re- Re EXAFS feature should be observed if this product were present. It is also possible that because of some doubt concerning the methodology used to obtain the SIMS spectra [II], some doubt should be expressed regarding the interpretation of the experimental data. It is only at the much lower loading of 2.5 wt.% on alumina, either as NH4Re04 or after calcination as 'Re^O^', that features can be distinguished showing dissimilarities with respect to crystalline NH4Re04, Figs. 3(c), 4(c), 5(c) and 6(c). The dissimilarity is so marked for 2.5% Re207/Al203 that the EXBACK spectrum. Fig. 6(c), is clearly and completely different from 76 NH4ReC>4, demonstrating that this supported Re phase differs considerably in nature from that in high loading samples. The analyses of these spectra will hopefully yield exciting and meaningful conclusions, so that it may well be that at 2.5% loading, the calcined Re material relates closely to a dispersed phase of Re207, existing perhaps as 'monolayer' clusters or islands. The enhanced stability of this phase of Re is in agreement with that expected from its proximity to the alumina surface. Finally, it has been shown that, for dispersed manganese dioxide oxida- tion catalysts [17] and for chromium oxide ethylene polymerisation catalysts [18], the shift of the X-ray absorption edge, relative to the edge position in the relevant metal, can be related to the oxidation state of the metal species in the compound. The absorption edge position was determined for the Re reference com- pounds and for the supported Re samples by obtaining the first derivative of the edge and by graphical construction. The values in Table 1 show that the maximum edge shift from Re(0) to Re(VIII) is only approximately 5.5 eV. The error which is obviously inherent in these measurements cannot allow these data to be used for comment on the edge shift variation. Nevertheless, the average oxidation state of calcined catalysts is seen to be close, if not equal to, 7+, by comparison with the reference compounds.

It may also prove possible to relate the absorption edge shift to the nearest-neighbour Re-0 distance and hence to the effective atomic charge on the Re.
