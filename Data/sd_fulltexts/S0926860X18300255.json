Graphical abstract The more and smaller-sized MoS2 which is active for the water gas shift reaction was formed on the Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O-Ce(5%) catalyst than Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O catalyst. A series of Mg-Al-Ce mixed oxides with (nMg2+)/(nCe3+ + nAl3+) = 5 and nCe3+/(nCe3+ + nAl3+) = 0 ∼ 7% were synthesized by co-precipitation method based on a hydrotalcite route and used as support to prepare Co-Mo sulfur-resistant water-gas shift (WGS) catalysts. The supports and catalysts were characterized by XRD, ICP, N2-physisorption, CO2-TPD, H2-TPR, H2S-TPS, TEM, and CO-IR. It is found that the catalytic performance and physicochemical property of the Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O catalyst are significantly influenced by the Ce modification. The addition of Ce effectively enhances the WGS activity and the highest activity is obtained on the Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O-CeO2 (5%) catalyst, where the activity at 623 K increases about 2.5 times. The results of H2S-TPS investigation show that in the presence of Ce, the H2S consumption peak shifts to lower temperatures and there is decrease of Mo sulfidation activation energy. Furthermore, HRTEM analysis shows that the addition of Ce (5%) results in decrease of MoS2 slab length and stacking number, and those of CO-IR characterization indicate increased exposure of surface MoS2 sites. It is suggested that the addition of Ce promotes the formation of MoS2 slabs that are smaller in size, leading to higher exposure of surface active sites and hence higher activity. Keywords Hydrogen production Water-gas shift reaction Hydrotalcite Magnesium-aluminum mixed oxide Co-Mo catalyst Ceria 1 Introduction Water-gas shift reaction (WGSR) is essential in coal gasification for large-scale hydrogen production [1–5]. Hydrogen is a useful feedstock for many chemical applications such as ammonia synthesis, petroleum refinery, and hydrogenation reactions [6–10]. The commercially available WGSR catalysts are those of Cu-Zn-Al [11–13] (low-temperature), Fe-Cr [14] (high-temperature), and Co-Mo [15,16] (broad-temperature) categories. There are also noble-metal catalysts developed for the reaction such as those based on Au[17], Pt [18], and Pd [19]. However, the high price and scarcity of noble metals restrict their industrial application. In addition, the noble metal catalysts and the Cu-Zn-Al and Fe-Cr commercial catalysts are highly sensitive to sulfur contamination [1]. Because the feed gas coming from coal gasification has multiple forms of sulfur, a sulfur-resistant catalyst is a necessity [15,20,21]. For feeds containing large quantities of hydrogen sulfide, the sulfur-tolerant Co-Mo catalysts are suitable [22]. Currently, the commercially available Co-Mo catalysts are essentially Co-Mo/MgO-Al2O3 and Co-Mo/Al2O3 [16,23]. However, the activity of these catalysts is relatively poor at low temperatures (523–623 K). Therefore, much efforts were paid to improve the catalytic performance of Co-Mo catalysts through the search of suitable support materials and effective preparation methods [15,23]. In a previous study [20], we reported that the Mg(Al)O mixed oxides derived from Mg-Al hydrotalcite-like compounds (HTlcs, also known as layered double hydroxides, LDHs) are good material to support the Co-Mo sulfur-resistant WGSR catalyst. Compared with the commercial Co-Mo/MgAl2O4 catalyst, the prepared Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O catalyst showed higher catalytic activity and stability. Nevertheless, the low-temperature activity of the Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O catalyst is still unsatisfactory and further improvement is required. In this work, the effect of CeO2 modification on the structural and catalytic property of Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O catalyst is studied. Ceria is well known as an effective support and promoter for Au- and Cu-based WGSR catalysts [24–26] due to strong metal-support interaction as well as its redox property; and in a number of studies it was also reported to show positive effect for Co-Mo catalysts. For example, Zhang et al. [15] reported that synergetic effect between K2O and CeO2 could improve the low-temperature activity of Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3 catalyst for WGSR. It was also reported that both catalytic activity and thermostability were remarkably improved when a small amount of CeO2 was added to Ni-Mo/TiO2 and Co-Mo/TiO2 hydrodesulphurization (HDS) catalysts, which have active metal and chemical state similar to those of Co-Mo sulfur-tolerant WGSR catalyst [27,28]. In this work, a series of Mg-Al-Ce mixed oxides with different Ce contents were synthesized via the hydrotalcite route and then used as support to prepare Co-Mo catalysts. The samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), inductively coupled plasma (ICP), N2-physisorption, temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD), temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), temperature-programmed sulfidation (H2S-TPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and CO-IR techniques. The relationship between the catalyst structure and catalytic performance for WGSR was discussed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation Mg-Al-Ce mixed oxides were prepared by co-precipitation method. A mixed aqueous solution of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O, Al(NO3)3·9H2O, and Ce(NO3)3·6H2O was added under stirring into a beaker containing an aqueous solution of sodium carbonate at room temperature. The pH of the solution was adjusted and kept at 10 ± 0.5 with an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide. The resulting suspension was then aged at 363 K for 24 h. Then the resulting precipitate was filtered out and washed several times with de-ionized water. Subsequently, the precipitate was dried at 373 K for 12 h and calcined at 973 K for 4 h in a static air atmosphere. The calcined product was pressed into a disk, crushed and sieved to particles with 20–40 mesh size. The precursors are denoted as Mg-Al-Ce (x)-LDHs, and the obtained supports are denoted as Mg(Al)O-CeO2 (x), where the molar ratio of Mg/(Al + Ce) is kept constant at 5, and x (x = 3, 5, 7%) refers the Ce/(Al + Ce) molar ratio. Co-Mo catalysts were prepared by incipient-wetness impregnation method. Typically, 5 g of support material (20–40 mesh) was impregnated with aqueous solution of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O to give 1.05 wt.% Co3O4 and 7 wt.% MoO3. The obtained slurry was aged at room temperature overnight, followed by drying at 373 K for 4 h and calcination in air at 723 K for 2 h. 2.2 Catalyst characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded from 10° to 100° (2 θ) on a PANalytical X’Pert spectrometer using Co Kα radiation (λ = 0.179 nm) at a scanning rate of 0.12°/min. The metal content in each precipitate was determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP, OPTIMA 8000, PerkinElmer) after the sample was completely dissolved in diluted hydrochloric acid. The BET surface area and pore volume were measured by means of nitrogen adsorption-desorption at 77 K on a Micrometrics ASAP 2020 instrument. CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) measurements were carried out on an AutoChem 2920 chemisorption analyzer (Micromeritics). First, around 50 mg of support was pre-treated with pure Ar at 573 K for 0.5 h to remove impurities and moisture, and then cooled down to 323 K. Subsequently, high-purity CO2 was introduced into the reactor for 1 h, followed by purging with Ar gas for 1 h to remove physically adsorbed CO2. Finally, the temperature was raised from 323 K to 1073 K at a heating rate of 10 K/min in Ar stream (30 mL/min). Desorption of CO2 was analyzed by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) measurements were performed on the same chemisorption analyzer. H2-TPR profile was recorded over 50 mg of sample from 323 K to 1173 K at a heating rate of 10 K/min in a 10% H2/Ar mixture (30 mL/min). The consumption of H2 was analyzed by TCD. H2S temperature-programmed sulfidation (H2S-TPS) patterns were registered on a Micromeritics Autochem 2920 with a corrosion-resistant TCD. H2S-TPS was carried out over 50 mg of sample under 1%H2S/9%H2/90%He mixed gas (30 mL/min) from room temperature to 823 K at a heating rate of 10 K/min. To calculate the activation energy of Mo sulfidation, a series of H2S-TPS patterns were recorded under different heating rates (3, 10 and 15 K/min). The activation energy of Mo sulfidation was calculated according to the literature [29]. HRTEM images were taken on an FEI Tecnai G2F20 at 200 KV. Before measurement, the oxide catalysts was sulfided with 1%H2S/9%H2/90%He at 623 K for 2 h and then quickly dispersed into ethanol. CO-IR characterization was conducted on a self-made cell named CellEx, which consisted of a stainless steel sulfidation reactor, an IR cell, and a transfer mechanism. The sample was pressed into a self-supporting pellet and sulfided at 623 K and 0.1 MPa with 10%H2S/H2 (30 mL/min) for 2 h. Then the sulfided pellet was transferred through the transfer mechanism to the IR cell under protection gas. Subsequently, low temperature CO adsorption, IR characterization, IR spectrum deconvolution, and sulfide site quantification were performed. More details about this equipment can be found in Ref. [30]. 2.3 Catalytic reaction WGSR was conducted on a fixed-bed micro reactor with 3 mL catalyst (20–40 mesh). Prior to the reaction, the catalyst was sulfided in 10%H2S/H2 at 623 K for 2 h. The catalyst activity was tested under the conditions: reaction pressure 0.15 MPa, reaction temperature 473–623 K, feed gas composition CO/H2/CO2 = 26/54/20, space velocity = 3000 h−1, and steam/gas ratio = 1. At each temperature, the activity was evaluated for 4 h. The CO conversion was analyzed using an on-line TCD-GC. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of Mg-Al-Ce (x)-LDHs and Mg-Al-Ce mixed oxide supports 3.1.1 XRD Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized precursors, which display the characteristic diffraction peaks of LDHs [20,31,32]. There are no other detectable phases, implying that the as-synthesized precursors have a pure LDHs phase. No diffraction peaks associated with Ce species such as CeO2 are observed, suggesting that the Ce species are highly dispersed or may be incorporated into the LDHs layer structure [32–35]. Since the ionic radius of Ce3+ (0.102 nm) is much larger than those of Mg2+ (0.069 nm) and Al3+ (0.0535 nm), the incorporation of Ce3+ ions into the Mg-Al LDHs is expected to cause an increase of lattice parameter [33,35]. In our case, the diffraction peak at 2θ = 12.85°, which is related to the cation-cation distance in the brucite layer [32], does not shift significantly, probably due to the low content of Ce. On the other hand, it is found that the intensity of the LDHs diffraction peaks decreases with the increase of Ce content, in accordance with the reports of Macedo Neto et al. [33] and Suárez-Quezada et al. [35], suggesting Ce incorporation into the Mg-Al LDHs structure. The intensity decrease may be attributed to the lattice distortion induced by the replacement of Al3+ with Ce3+. Nevertheless, owing to the large difference in the ionic radii between Ce3+ and Mg2+ and Al3+, it is considered that only a small fraction of Ce can be incorporated into the LDHs, and the presence of small-sized CeO2 out of the XRD detection limit cannot be ruled out. According to the ICP results as listed in Table 1 , within experimental errors the metal compositions of the precursors are close to those of the beginning mixed aqueous solutions, suggesting that most of the Ce cations are incorporated into the Mg-Al-Ce mixed oxide supports. Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the mixed oxides obtained by calcination of the precursors at 973 K. The two strong reflection peaks at 2θ = 51.2° and 74.9° can be attributed to Mg(Al)O mixed oxide, where Al3+ is incorporated into the MgO framework to form a solid solution [36]. In addition to Mg(Al)O, there also appears a small amount of Al2O3 and/or MgAl2O4. The presence of cubic CeO2 is also detected at 2θ = 33.2°, in accordance with the report of Wang et al. [32]. Owing to the large differences in lattice structures and ionic radii between CeO2 and MgO, it would be difficult for Ce to enter the MgO structure. Based on the diffraction peak at 2θ = 51.2°, the average crystallite size of Mg(Al)O was calculated by the Scherrer equation. As listed in Table 1, the crystallite size of Mg(Al)O decreases from 10.7 nm to 8.1 nm with the increase of Ce content, suggesting that the addition of Ce inhibits the crystal growth of Mg(Al)O. 3.1.2 N2 physical adsorption As shown in Table 1, the addition of Ce has a marked effect on the textural property of Mg-Al support. The Ce-modified samples show BET surface areas of 82–109 m2 g−1, which are much higher than that of the Ce-free sample. Besides, the pore volumes and pore diameters also become larger in the presence of Ce. Typically, the BET surface area, pore volume, and pore diameter increase with increasing Ce content from 3% to 7%. This may be related to the size decrease of Mg(Al)O due to the addition of CeO2 as indicated by XRD. Furthermore, textural measurement of the Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O-CeO2 catalysts were performed, and the results compared with those of the Mg-Al-Ce supports. With the introduction of Co and Mo species, there is reduction of BET surface area, pore volume and pore diameter plausibly a result of pore plugging. 3.1.3 CO2-TPD CO2-TPD measurements were conducted to determine the surface basicity. As presented in Fig. 3 (A), all CO2-TPD profiles are similar to each other in shape, which show two CO2 desorption peaks. The low-temperature peak at 373–473 K is assigned to the CO2 adsorbed on the weak basic sites, while the high-temperature peak at 573–773 K is attributed to the CO2 chemisorbed on the moderate-strong basic sites with three- and four-fold-coordinated O2− anions [37–40]. For the low-temperature peak, with increasing Ce content the peak area [Fig. 3(B) black] and position change only slightly, suggesting that the addition of Ce has little effect on the weak basic sites. On the other hand, the area of the high-temperature peak [Fig. 3(B) red] enlarges with increasing Ce content, indicative of the increase of moderate-strong basic sites. It is noted that the area of the high-temperature peak of the Ce(7%) sample is almost 4 times that of the Ce(0%) sample. It is considered that an increase in the number of moderate-strong basic sites may be favorable for the dispersion of active ingredients and enhancement of catalytic activity [15]. 3.2 WGSR activity of Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O-CeO2 catalysts The Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O-CeO2 catalysts were sulfided with 10%H2S/H2 at 623 K for 2 h and then tested for WGSR at 0.15 MPa and elevated temperatures from 473 to 623 K. As shown in Fig. 4 (A), all catalysts show low WGSR rates (less than 1 μmol s−1 gcat −1) below 523 K. As the temperature increases, the reaction rate increases remarkably particularly for those Ce-modified catalysts. As can be seen, the addition of Ce promotes the catalytic activity. At 623 K, the WGSR rate increases from 1.03 μmol s−1 gcat −1 for Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O to 2.52 mol s−1 gcat −1 for Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O-CeO2 (5%) by about 2.5 times, whereas it decreases to 1.74 μmol s−1 gcat −1 for Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O-CeO2 (7%). The highest activity is obtained on the Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O-CeO2 (5%) catalyst. The results indicate that the addition of Ce to Mg(Al)O is an effective method to obtain CoMo-based WGSR catalysts of improved performance. The Arrhenius plots and the calculated apparent activation energies over the Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O-CeO2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 4(B). The apparent activation energies are in the range of 41.2–58.2 kJ/mol, in general agreement with the values (30.4–112 kJ/mol) reported in the literature [44]. As can be seen, the activation energy decreases from 58.2 to 41.2 kJ/mol as the Ce content increases from 0 to 5%; nevertheless, further increasing the Ce content to 7% leads to increase of activation energy. This trend is in good agreement with the activity order. 3.3 Characterizations of Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O-CeO2 catalysts 3.3.1 H2-TPR The H2-TPR technique was used to investigate the reduction behavior of Mo species on the Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O-CeO2 catalysts. The obtained H2-TPR profiles and the total H2 consumption are shown in Fig. 5 . Two main broad and one weak H2 consumption peaks are observed over the Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O catalyst, which correspond to the reduction of different types of Mo species. The first peak at 573–723 K is ascribed to the reduction of octahedral Mo6+ to Mo4+, and the peak at about 773 K is assigned to the reduction of tetrahedral Mo6+ to Mo4+, while the peak at 1062 K is attributed to the second-step reduction of octahedral and tetrahedral Mo4+ to metallic Mo [23,41–44]. For the Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O-CeO2 catalysts, another H2 consumption peak is observed at 793–834 K, which can be attributed to the reduction of CeO2 [45]. It is noted that the total H2 consumption of the Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O-CeO2 catalysts calculated according to the peak areas and calibration curve, especially that of the Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O-CeO2 (5%) catalyst, are higher than that of the Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O catalyst [Fig. 5(B)], suggesting that more reducible Mo species are formed on the Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O-CeO2 catalysts. As reported in our previous work [20] and literatures [41,46], the reduction peaks of Co oxides were suppressed in the cases of CoMo catalysts. Consequently, the H2-TPR profiles of CoMo catalysts are somewhat similar to that of Mo-alone samples. 3.3.2 H2S-TPS Since the Mo sulfided phase is the active sites for WGSR [20,47,48], the sulfidation behavior of the Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O-CeO2 catalysts was investigated by H2S-TPS. The obtained results are shown in Fig. 6 . The TPS patterns are conformed by one well-defined peak, corresponding to H2S consumption during sulfidation [20]. With the increase of Ce content, the H2S consumption peak shifts from 668 K to 624 K. The H2S consumption peak areas normalized by the catalyst weight are shown in Fig. 6 (inset). The Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O-CeO2 (5%) sample consumes the largest amount of H2S, which means that more Mo sulfided phase may be formed. Based on the H2S-TPS measurements at different heating rates, the sulfidation activation energy (Es) was calculated and shown in Table 1. The Es value decreases from 102 kJ/mol to 92 kJ/mol as the Ce content increases from 0 to 5%, and then increases slightly to 94 kJ/mol with further increase of Ce content to 7%. These results clearly reveal that the addition of Ce promotes Mo sulfidization. In the activity test, the catalyst sulfidation was performed at 623 K, which is close to the maximum-consumption temperature for Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O-CeO2 but lower than that for Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O. It is thus reasonable to consider that more sulfided phase can be formed on the Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O-CeO2 catalysts under the adopted sulfidization conditions. 3.3.3 HRTEM The sulfided Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O and Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O-CeO2 (5%) catalysts were further analyzed by HRTEM to evaluate the influence of Ce on the morphology of MoS2 phase. As shown in Fig. 7 (A) and (B), the Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O catalyst shows more triple-layered MoS2 slabs with slab length longer than that of the Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O-CeO2 (5%) catalyst, suggesting that the addition of Ce promotes the formation of smaller MoS2 slabs [49]. From the statistical data on MoS2 phase (around 200 MoS2 slabs) (Fig. 7(C) and (D)), the average slab length for Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O is 4.38 nm, and it decreases slightly to 4.26 nm for Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O-CeO2 (5%). In line with Fig. 7(C), larger proportion (84%) of MoS2 with slab length <5 nm was found on the Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O-CeO2 (5%) catalyst in comparison to that (47%) of the Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O catalyst. Besides, the Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O-CeO2 (5%) catalyst has a smaller stacking number of MoS2 than the Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O catalyst. The average slab stacking numbers are estimated to be 1.91 and 1.42 for Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O and Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O-CeO2 (5%), respectively. As MoS2 is the active phase for WGSR, the small-sized MoS2 slabs are expected to show higher activity due to higher exposure of active sites [50]. 3.3.4 CO-IR Low temperature (liquid nitrogen temperature) CO adsorption followed by in-situ IR spectroscopy ((CO-IR)) has been proved to be an effective technique to titrate MoS2 surface active sites on sulfided Co-Mo catalyst [51]. The IR spectra of CO adsorption (100 K, 133 Pa CO at equilibrium) on the sulfided Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O and Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O-CeO2 (5%) catalysts are shown in Fig. 8 . In both cases, two v(CO) bands located at 2162 cm−1 and 2064 cm−1 are clearly detected, which are attributed to CO adsorption on the OH groups of support and on the S-edge of MoS2 phase, respectively [30,52]. The CO bands at 2162 cm−1 observed over the two catalysts look similar but the CO bands at 2064 cm−1 are different. First, the CO band intensity of Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O-CeO2 (5%) is higher than that of Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O, indicating the former has higher exposure of MoS2 surface sites. This result combined with the H2S-TPS and HRTEM results demonstrates the formation of more small-sized MoS2 slabs on the Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O-CeO2 (5%) catalyst. The increased exposure of surface MoS2 sites should contribute to the increase of activity in WGSR. Second, the CO band is up-shifted (∼12 cm−1) due to the addition of Ce as shown in Fig. 8 (inset). The shift of CO band may be explained as a result of increase of electron density on the S-edge, probably a consequence of electronic interaction between MoS2 and Mg(Al)O and/or CeO2. This may explain the lower WGSR activation energy on the Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O-CeO2 (5%) catalyst. 4 Conclusions The catalytic performance and structural property of Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O catalyst are significantly affected by the addition of Ce. The activity test showed that the addition of Ce to Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O catalyst effectively enhances the WGSR activity. The Co-Mo/Mg(Al)-CeO2 (5%) catalyst exhibits the highest activity, where the activation energy decreases from 58.2 kJ/mol to 41.2 kJ/mol, and the activity at 623 K increases about 2.5 times. The H2S-TPS characterization shows that on the Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O-CeO2 catalysts the H2S consumption peak shifts to lower temperatures and the activation energy of Mo sulfidation decreases as compared to the Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O catalyst, suggesting that Mo sulfidation is promoted in the presence of Ce. Furthermore, the HRTEM measurement shows that the slab length and stacking number of MoS2 active phase decrease as a result of Ce (5%) addition, and CO-IR characterization indicates that the number of surface MoS2 sites on Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O-CeO2 (5%) is higher than that on Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O. It is deduced that the addition of Ce promotes the generation of MoS2 slabs of smaller size, leading to higher number of surface active sites and thus the enhanced activity.

        "dc:description": "A series of Mg-Al-Ce mixed oxides with (nMg2+)/(nCe3+ + nAl3+) = 5 and nCe3+/(nCe3+ + nAl3+) = 0 ∼ 7% were synthesized by co-precipitation method based on a hydrotalcite route and used as support to prepare Co-Mo sulfur-resistant water-gas shift (WGS) catalysts. The supports and catalysts were characterized by XRD, ICP, N2-physisorption, CO2-TPD, H2-TPR, H2S-TPS, TEM, and CO-IR. It is found that the catalytic performance and physicochemical property of the Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O catalyst are significantly influenced by the Ce modification. The addition of Ce effectively enhances the WGS activity and the highest activity is obtained on the Co-Mo/Mg(Al)O-CeO2 (5%) catalyst, where the activity at 623 K increases about 2.5 times. The results of H2S-TPS investigation show that in the presence of Ce, the H2S consumption peak shifts to lower temperatures and there is decrease of Mo sulfidation activation energy. Furthermore, HRTEM analysis shows that the addition of Ce (5%) results in decrease of MoS2 slab length and stacking number, and those of CO-IR characterization indicate increased exposure of surface MoS2 sites. It is suggested that the addition of Ce promotes the formation of MoS2 slabs that are smaller in size, leading to higher exposure of surface active sites and hence higher activity.",
