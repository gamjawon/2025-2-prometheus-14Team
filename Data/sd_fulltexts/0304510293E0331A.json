The results indicate that the sintering occurs in both reduction and dehydrogenation processes. The Crz03-promoted copper catalysts prevent sintering in both reduction and reaction processes. The catalyst with Cr/Cu molar ratio of 4/40 has the highest activity and stability. The temperature-programmed reduction results indicate that the good dispersion of CrZ03 promoter helps to prevent sintering in the reduction process. The catalyst which contains Cu and ,CuCr204 has a lower initial activity and the thermal stability is as poor as the unpromoted one. Cu instead of Cu2+ is the active site. The TOFs of promoted catalysts with Cr/Cu = 1 /40 to 6/40 are lower than that of unpromoted catalyst, and thus the chromic oxide is not just a textural promoter of Cu. The higher copper surface areas of promoted catalysts easily overcome the loss in TOFs. Key words: chromic oxide; copper; dehydrogenation; ethanol; promoter 1. Introduction Copper catalysts are active for dehydrogenation of alcohols. For practical application, copper is always used in the form of a complex system by adding other chemical compounds as additives [ 1-12 ] . Chromium is the most popular element as an additive in copper catalysts for dehydrogenation of alcohols [ 13-15 ] , and the Cr component is usually in the form of Cr203 or CuCr204 in the catalysts. As early as 1934, Young [ 16] claimed a long life, high activity catalyst using a silica *Corresponding author; fax. ( +886-3)4252296.

[ 17 ] discovered that the CuCr204 and the metallic copper that dispersed on chromic oxide (Cr203) as a result of strong reduction of CuCr204 are active for methanol decomposition. Tonner et al. [ 13 ] assessed the dehydrogenation of methanol to methyl formate on the basis of specific rate constants, and found that commercial copper chromite catalysts, which consisted of intimate clusters of CuO and CuCr204 prior to reduction [ 18,19] , were particularly effective. It is reported that the presence of Cr203 greatly improved the performance of copper metal in the dehydrogenation reaction since it help in prolonging the activity and stability of the copper catalysts [ 11,20] . Prasad et al. suggested that Cr203 particles act as barriers between crystallites of copper which help to prevent sintering of copper crystallites throughout the period of use [ 21 ] . Although the dehydrogenation of various alcohols over copper-chromium catalysts has been studied previously, a detailed study of the effects of chromium and the difference between Cr203 and CuCr204 in a series of catalysts have not appeared. In the present work we have investigated the dehydrogenation of ethanol on a series of copper-chromium catalysts. In order to prevent the effect of support, unsupported catalysts were used in this study. Previously reported results [ 15 ] are also included for comparison. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation The copper-chromium catalysts with various Cr to Cu molar ratios of 0 to 0.5 were prepared from common solutions of copper nitrate (Cu(N03)2.3H20) and chromium nitrate (Cr(N03)3-9H20) using a sodium carbonate (Na2C03* lOHZ0) solution as precipitant. A well-stirred container was charged with distilled water as buffer. The previously described two solutions were slowly added to this distilled water with the rate of addition controlled in order to maintain the pH of the solution at a constant value of 8.0 0.1. The solution was kept at a temperature of 55 1 C. The resulting precipitate was filtered, washed with distilled water, and dried overnight at 100 C, followed by calcination at 450 C in a muffle furnace for 3 h. For ethanol dehydrogenation tests, each catalyst was reduced in situ at 200 C for 6 h by inflow of 10% Hz in argon. A stoichiometric shorthand notation is used to indicate the atomic ratio of Cr to Cu. For example, the catalyst which has Cr to Cu atomic ratio of 1 /40 is referred to as Cr/Cu = 1 /40. 2.2. X-ray diffraction studies X-ray powder diffraction patterns were obtained using a Siemens D-500 diffractometer employing nickel-filtered Cu Ka radiation (1.542 A). The crystallite sizes are calculated from XRD line broadening analysis using Bragg's equation D=KA/b cos0, where K, the particle shape factor, was taken as 0.89. Yau-Jen Tu et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 89 (1994)179-190 181 2.3. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) The TPR experimental was carried out by using a quartz U-tube reactor, similar to that described by Jenkins et al. [ 22 ] and Menon et al. [ 23 ] . The catalyst was loaded on a sintered quartz disk in the reactor, with gas fluid flowing upward, the sintered disk served as a good preheater. The catalyst usually formed a bed of less than 6 mm in thickness. The HZ in Ar carrier gas was further purified by passing through an Oxisorb (Alltech) and a 5A molecular sieve trap to remove trace amounts of oxygen and water. This gas stream was then split, one path leading to the reference arm of a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) (Shimadzu GC-8A) and the other passing through the reactor before going to the detector. Any reaction products generated during TPR were trapped by a dry-ice trap located between the reactor and the TCD. The TCD signal was calibrated by injecting a pure sample by using a Valco sampling valve of known volume. Several millimeters of glass wool were added at each end of the reactor to avoid entrance and exit effects, but there was no dilution of the catalysts. Before starting the TPR experiments, 40 mg of catalyst was dried in flowing Ar at 100 C for 1 h. 10% Hz was used as a reducing gas at a flow rate of 60 ml/min. The rate of temperature rise in the TPR experiment was 5 C/min up to 800 C. 2.4. Copper surface area determination The copper surface area and metal dispersion were determined by reaction of copper with nitrous oxide following the method of Bond and Namijo [24]. The instrument is the same as the TPR experiment. Firstly, a TPR was performed to measure the total amount of reducible copper. Reduction of the catalyst was performed by heating the sample from ambient to 200 C at 10 C/min in 10% HZ/Ar flow (60 ml/min) and kept it at 200 C for 1 h at least. The temperature was then kept at 60 C. The pure NZO was allowed to flow over the sample for 60 min at 60 ml/min. It is believed that the surface metallic copper was oxidized to CU20 at this condition. A second TPR can be performed to measure the amount of surface metallic copper. It is assumed that calcination in each sample afforded CuO, and also produced a reduced Cu catalyst in the TPR runs. The dispersion was then calculated using the copper content as determined by TPR. The copper surface area can be determined by assuming 1.47 X 10'9 atoms m-2. To avoid possible coke formation on the catalysts used, the surface area of the copper of the catalyst used was determined after flowing air in situ at 200 C for 4 h. 2.5. Scanning electron microscopy Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out for structure investigation using a Hitachi S-800 SEM (20 kV electron beam). All the catalysts, calcined, reduced and used, were investigated. 2.6. Ethanol dehydrogenation In a typical experiment 40 mg of sample, mixed with 200 mg quartz wool in a U-shaped Pyrex reactor, was reduced at 200 C for 6 h by a flowing 10% HZ/Ar mixture. A saturator 182 Yau-Jen Tu et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalvsis 89 (1994) 179-190 containing 95% ethanol was kept at a constant temperature of 22 C. Nitrogen was used as a carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 20 ml/min (STP). All experiments were performed at 310 C. To prevent possible condensation, all gas line connections and valves were wrapped with heating tapes. The products were sampled by a six-port valve and analyzed by a Shimadzu gas chromatograph (GC-8A) with a thermal conductivity detector. The column was three meters long and loaded with Porapak QS which was maintained at 110 C. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. X-ray diffraction studies The phase compositions of calcined and reduced catalysts are summarized in Table 1. All the calcined catalysts exhibited the CuO phase only. The CuCr204 phase was only detected in the catalyst with Cr/Cu = 20/40. It was found that copper oxide in the calcined catalysts was easily reduced into metallic copper by inflow of 10% HZ in Ar for 6 h at 200 C while the CuCr,04 in the catalyst with Cr/Cu=20/40 was not reduced in the reduction process. The XRD results did not show any peak of Cr component for the catalysts with Cr/Cu =1 /40 to 6/40. This can be attributed to the following reasons: the crystallite size of the Cr component in these catalysts is too small to be detected or it is amorphous. The crystallite sizes of calcined and reduced catalysts calculated by Bragg's law are listed in Table 1. The average crystallite sizes of copper oxide in all calcined samples are 133 10 A. This result shows that the incorporation of chromium into copper has no effect on the average crystallite size of copper oxide in the calcination process. The crystallite sizes of metallic copper in the reduced catalysts can be calculated on the basis of the crystallite size of copper oxide using the equation, assuming a spherical crystal: ,,TDcuOPCuo __ 7TDcuPCU (1) 6MCu0 6MCu where D is the average crystallite size, p is the density (pcuo = 6.32 and pcu = 8.96 g/cm'), and M is molar weight (MC o=79.54, MC =63.54 g/mol). The crystallite sizes of copper Table 1 Phase compositions and crystallite sizes of catalysts Cr/Cu ratio 0/40 1/40 2/40 3/40 4/40 5/40 6/40 20/40 calcined catalysts phase composition Cu0 Cu0 Cu0 Cu0 Cu0 Cu0 Cu0 Cu0 CuCrz04 CuO crystal size (A) 138 143 133 138 123 133 138 reduced catalysts phase composition Cu Cu Cu Cu Cu Cu Cu Cu CuCr_OQ copper crystal size (A) 270 230 195 180 170 175 170 'Not determined. Yau-Jen Tu et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 89 (1994)179-190 183 in the reduced catalysts calculated from Eq. 1 are nearly 110 A, nevertheless the copper crystallite size calculated by Bragg's law as shown in Table 1 are greater than 110 A. The results strongly suggest that the metallic particles of copper can sinter to yield relatively larger crystals in the reduction process. The reduction of copper oxide is an exothermic reaction CuO+Hz ;c~ Cu +H20 AH(200'C) = -83.1 kJ/mol (2) The growth of copper crystallite size results from the temperature rise in the bed. Furthermore, the copper crystallite sizes of promoted catalysts are smaller than that of unpromoted catalyst. The Cr component can prevent sintering of copper crystal in the reduction process. 3.2. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) Temperature-programmed reduction not only shows the quantity of hydrogen consumed, and thus the degree of oxidation of metal after calcination, but also provides information about the species produced during the calcination step, especially through analysis of the reduction temperature [ 25 ] . Fig. 1 depicts the TPR spectra obtained over the catalysts with different Cr/Cu molar ratios. Four peaks are seen with maxima at nearly 205 C (referred to as peak I), 230 C (peak 11), 380 C (peak III), and 400 C (peak IV). Each peak area can be evaluated by deconvolution of the TPR profile, namely, A,, An, A ,, and Aiv. For unpromoted copper catalysts, the TPR curve shows only a single peak of hydrogen consumption at 205 C. It has been attributed to the reduction of the CuO crystallites to metallic copper. After adding chromium to the catalyst, a second peak at 230 C was observed, and A depends markedly upon Cr/Cu molar ratio. It has been widely accepted that reducibility of the sample can be influenced by its surroundings. Adkins et al. [26] reported that the complete reduction of Cu\" can be inhibited by adding basic oxides, and this is achieved by stabilization of Cu' + [ 27 ] . Prasad et al. [ 11 ] suggested that the presence of CrZ03 promoter helps to maintain dispersion of metallic copper during reduction of CuO. Thus, it seems reasonable to propose that the latter peak in the TPR pattern is due to some CuO surrounding the Cr203 environment, making them more difficult to reduce. As the Cr/ Cu molar ratio increases to 20/40, the third and fourth hydrogen-consumption peaks appear. In conjunction with the XRD results in Table 1, peaks III and IV can be ascribed to the reduction of CuCr204. peak III: CuCr2 04 H2 .CuzCr204+Crz03+H20 (3) peak IV: Cu2 Cr2 04 HZ .2Cu+Cr203 +H,O (4) The variation in the TPR peak area ratio of An to A, + A is shown in Fig. 2. The ratio of A to A, + A refers to the index of CuO influenced by chromic oxide surrounded in the reduction process. For different Cr/ Cu ratios, the area of peak 11 to peak I + II has a maximum at Cr/Cu=4/40. The first part from Cr/Cu= 1/40 to 4/40 shows increasing hydrogen 184 Yau-Jen Tu et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 89 (1994) 179-190 I Cr/Cu= o/O If t /.w d z/ao c 0 s/4o o 4/40 U C m P 5/40 100 200 300 400 500 T/ C Fig. 1. Temperature-programmed-reduction of various catalysts. (The temperature was raised up to 800 C. However, there is no reduction peak after 300 C except the catalyst of Cr/Cu=20/40 which gave 2 reduction peaks at around 400 C.) consumption with increasing Cr/Cu ratio. In contrast, the second part from Cr/Cu=4/40 to 6/40 shows decreasing hydrogen consumption with increasing Cr/Cu ratio. The trend of the first part indicates the higher the Cr/Cu ratio, the more the copper oxide is influenced by the surrounding good dispersion of chromic oxide. In the second part, the hydrogen consumption fell gradually which may be due to the chromium ion concentration in the coprecipitation exceeding a critical value, resulting in the larger clusters of Cr components. The lower degree of dispersion of chromic oxide will reduce the effective contacting efficiency of copper oxide and chromic. The chromic oxide has a very high, negative, free energy of formation. It cannot be reduced in the reduction process at temperatures below 800 C. This result is consistent with the report by Rao et al. [ 12] . A sample of pure chromic oxide prepared by the precipitation method was also tested, and no peak was observed in this study. 3.3. Copper surface area The metal dispersion and copper surface area determined from the dissociative adsorption of nitrous oxide are shown in Fig. 3.

Copper surface areas of catalysts. is 9.0 m2/g Cu. Apparently, the copper surface area of catalyst increases by adding chromium into the catalyst, which results from that the chromic oxide resists sintering in the reduction process as discussion in the TPR section. As shown in Fig. 3, the copper surface areas decreased markedly after reaction at 310 C for 8 h. This result reveals that sintering of catalysts occurred in the dehydrogenation process. The copper surface areas of promoted catalysts decrease slower than that of unpromoted catalyst, thus sintering can be retarded by adding chromium to the catalyst. Since chromic oxide cannot fit into the copper lattice, Prasad et al. [ 11 ] suggested that chromic oxide forms a barrier phase between the copper crystallites. In addition, higher melting points of chromic oxide (2435 C) prevents itself from sintering during the reaction process. 186 Yau-Jen Tit et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalvsis 89 (1994) 179-190 3.4. Scanning electron microscopy The scanning electron micrograph images of unpromoted copper catalyst are shown in Figs. 4(a), (b) and (c). The results indicated that serious sintering occurred in both reduction and dehydrogenation processes. For the promoted catalysts with Cr/Cu=4/40, as shown in Figs. 5 (a), 5 (b) and 5 (c) , the particle sizes increased slightly under reduction and dehydrogenation processes. This is consistent with our X-ray diffraction and copper surface area analyses. 3.5. Reaction studies The dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde and hydrogen is endothermic.

The activity vs. time-on-stream is shown in Fig. 6. The pure metallic copper catalyst decays rapidly. The promoted catalysts with Cr/Cu=1 /40 to 6/40 are more stable than the unpromoted one in the reaction process. Research in this laboratory [ 15] has shown that the predominant decay of copper catalysts in ethanol dehydrogenation is sintering rather than coking. Several authors [ 1,5,28] have reported that the dehydrogenation activity is proportional to the metallic copper surface area. In this study, it shows that the turnover frequencies JOB) of promoted catalysts are lower than that of unpromoted catalyst as presented in Table 2. The results indicate that it is not just a structure promoter. There are some interactions between Cu and Cr203. Cr203 is a p-type semiconductor with a work function (5.88 eV) higher than that of Cu (4.55 eV). Chen et al. [29] reported that an inverse of strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) existed on the Cu/Cr203 catalyst, the electron density can transfer from Cu to the Cr203 support. Thus, electronic interactions between Cu and Cr203 enhance the quantity and stability of HZ adsorption on Cu [ 29 ] . Apply the inverse of SMSI to this study, the Cr203 promoted copper catalysts would enhance the quantity and stability of HZ adsorption on Cu in dehydrogenation reaction. Thus a possible local excess of hydrogen over promoted catalysts would favor the reverse of the dehydrogenation reaction (Eq. 5). The TOFs of Cr203 promoted catalysts are lower than that of pure Cu' catalysts. Nevertheless it seems also that the higher copper surface areas obtained in the promoted catalysts easily overcome the loss in TOFs. For the dehydroge- 188 Yau-Jen Tu et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalvsis 89 (/994) 179-190 nation of methanol to methyl formate over copper catalysts, Tonner et al. [ 13 ] also reported low TOFs for Cu on Cr203 and copper chromite catalysts. Cunningham et al. [30,31] reported that isopropanol dehydrogenation activity was enhanced when more than one valance state of copper - probably Cu' and Cu' + in Cu0 are presented together in the working-state surfaces. In this study, the synergetic promotion of Cu\" and CUZ+ in CuCr204 is not shown. As shown in Fig. 1, only a small portion of catalyst with Cr/Cu=20/40 was reduced at 200 C. Thus the low initial activity of catalyst with Cr/Cu=20/40 results from the low reducibility of catalyst. Tonner et al. [ 13 ] reported that the commercial copper chromite catalysts, which consist of CuO and CuCr204 prior to reduction [ 18,19], are effective for dehydrogenation of methanol to methyl formate at 220 C via the reassessment of the specific rate constant. In this study, the stability of the catalyst with Cr/Cu = 20/40 is as poor as the unpromoted one, thus this catalyst is not thermally durable at 310 C. 4. Conclusion The study of copper-chromium catalysts leads to the following conclusions: 1. The CuO crystallite sizes of calcinated catalysts are 133 10 A, and the crystallite sizes of Cu\" enlarge in the reduction process due to sintering. The TPR results indicate that the good dispersion of Cr203 promoter helps to prevent sintering in the reduction process. 2. Sintering occurs in both reduction and dehydrogenation processes. The Cr203 promoted catalysts have higher copper surface areas and are more stable than the unpromoted one. The catalyst with Cr/Cu=4/40 gives the highest Cu surface area and activity. The catalyst with Cr/Cu=20/40 has phase compositions of Cu and CuCr20,, and the stability is as poor as that of the unpromoted one. 3. The TOFs of promoted catalysts with Cr/Cu=1/40 to 6/40 are lower than that of unpromoted catalyst, nevertheless the higher copper surface areas of promoted catalysts easily overcome the loss in TOFs. 4. Cu' instead of Cu` + is the active site for ethanol dehydrogenation. 5. Chromic oxide is not just a structure promoter of Cu. There are some interactions between Cu and Cr203. 5.

(+886-3)4252296. 1 Present address: Refining and Manufacturing Research Institute, Chinese Petroleum Corporation, Chiayi 60036, Taiwan. The dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde has been studied over a series of unsupported copper-chromium catalysts. The results indicate that the sintering occurs in both reduction and dehydrogenation processes. The Cr2O3-promoted copper catalysts prevent sintering in both reduction and reaction processes. The catalyst with Cr/Cu molar ratio of 4/40 has the highest activity and stability. The temperature-programmed reduction results indicate that the good dispersion of Cr2O3 promoter helps to prevent sintering in the reduction process. The catalyst which contains Cu and CuCr2O4 has a lower initial activity and the thermal stability is as poor as the unpromoted one. Cu0 instead of Cu2+ is the active site. The TOFs of promoted catalysts with Cr/Cu = 1/40 to 6/40 are lower than that of unpromoted catalyst, and thus the chromic oxide is not just a textural promoter of Cu. The higher copper surface areas of promoted catalysts easily overcome the loss in TOFs. Keywords chromic oxide copper dehydrogenation ethanol promoter References [1] F. Pepe R. Polini L.
