The latter process could be depressed or eliminated by application of a non- polar solvent as the organic phase. Addition of aqueous NaB(C6Hg)4 to the reaction mixture allowed facile recovery of the used rhodium catalyst as NaRhCl4. The diene disproportionation has been shown to involve a rho- dium hydride species which is assumed to be formed by hydrogen transfer from the water to the starting ion pair. Introduction Recently [1] we have proposed that a rhodium complex of 1,3-cyclo- hexadiene is formed in a series of steps during the [(CgH^NCCI^)]*- [RhC^'nH^Ol'-catalyzed hydrogenation of benzene. Owing to the revers- ible nature of these steps, the treatment of the diene with the catalyst at 20 C results in its dehydrogenation and formation of benzene (eqn. (1)). CfiHg . CfeHfi + H^ (1) We now find that at a somewhat higher temperature the RhCl3- Aliquat 336 catalyst, as well as some analogous ion pairs, promote still another transformation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene: disproportionation into benzene and cyclohexene (eqn. (2)). 2C<,Hg ^ CfiHe + C<,Hio (2) * Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/88/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 208 Experimental General procedure for transformation of 1,3-cyclohexadienes into benzene and cyclohexene derivatives A solution of 10 mg (3.79 X 1CT2 mmol) of RhCla-SHp in 1 ml of deionized water was agitated under argon with a solution of 5.4 X 10~2 mmol of an appropriate phase transfer catalyst in 0.5 ml of CHgNO;. After 15 min the mixture was treated with 2 mmol of freshly purified cyclic diene and 100 fd of an internal standard (e.g. toluene in the transformation of unsubstituted 1,3-cyclohexadiene) and stirred (400 rpm) at 70 C. At intervals of 1 -10 min, 2-y\\ samples were withdrawn from the organic layer and immediately frozen at 40 C. GC analysis was carried out on a 2 m long column packed with 10% Carbowax 20 M on Chromosorb W (60 - 80 mesh) (column, 50 C, injector and detector, 80 C). Some representative results are summarized in Table 1. Recovery and recycling of the rhodium catalyst Typically, the above process was stopped at 85% conversion. The reaction mixture was cooled and the phases separated. The organic layer was stirred for 5 min under argon with 1 ml of aqueous sodium tetraphenyl- borate solution containing 20 mg (5.8 X 10~2 mmol) of the lipophilic salt. To the rhodium-containing aqueous solution was then added a fresh solution of 7.9 X 10~2 mmol of the phase transfer catalyst in 0.5 ml of nitromethane, containing 100 {d of the internal standard. After stirring the mixture for 15 min, 2 mmol of purified cyclic diene was added and the disproportiona- tion conducted as above. For efficient recovery of the rhodium from the second run, 39 mg (11.4 X 10~2 mmol) of sodium tetraphenylborate was required, and for re-extraction of the catalyst into the organic phase for the third run 15.1 X 10~2 mmol of the phase transfer catalyst was used. Results and discussion The results given in Table 1 indicate that under the experimental conditions the RhC^-ammonium salt ion pair promotes simultaneous disproportionation and dehydrogenation of various 1,3-cyclohexadiene derivatives. 1,2-Dihydronaphthalene, which can be regarded as a conjugated cyclic diene in which an olefinic linkage is replaced by an aromatic bond, undergoes solely disproportionation. Nonconjugated cyclic dienes proved, however, neither to be converted into 1,3-cycloolefins nor to follow reac- tions (1) and (2). Thus, 1,4-cyclohexadiene as well as 1,4,5,8-tetrahydro- naphthalene were completely unaffected by the rhodium catalyst at 70 C. 4-Vinylcyclohexene having one endo- and one exo-cyclic double bond was transformed, even at 90 C, only to the equilibrium mixture of the starting diene, and E- and .Z-4-ethylidenecyclohexene. The failure of the rhodium catalysts to promote the formation of a 1,3-cyclodiene system is remarkable, vsS-i'sQ, 0w V 0X-ifta a0 e S' \"s \"a\" -^ w( 2 5 '?> s 43 . a0 3 rt -0 0 0 .a rt w a A-*^ ,2 t+-4 en 0 ^10) sa > 0 top nM u 0s- tl S-1 a c a .2 -a 4^ -<-> aU}0) 0at> 03 0IS S t w ' S s-t 3 S, \"3 >< uIV .2' ^0 (8 0)rt 4J g0.66' iii i-'-4- ^ ^ 0 w ^-t 0 a .2 '+3 S c O) lit 0 f-4 'a !>> 43 Q> T3 a <u a!

Only the very sensitive 1,5,8-p-menthatriene [2] was found to undergo partial isoaromatization top-cymene, but yielded also the expected dehydrogenation and disproportionation products 2-(4-methyl- phenyl)propene, 2,8(9)-p-menthadiene and limonene. The two latter men- thadienes isomerized to give terpinolene and isoterpinolene but did not form dehydrogenation products unless heated at 90 C for a prolonged period. (Limonene, e.g., formed 10% of p-cymene when heated with the rhodium catalyst for 48 h). The alkyi functions in substituted 1,3-cyclohexadienes proved to undergo neither structural nor positional changes by the rhodium catalyst. Methoxy groups, however, were found to be affected and to undergo partial hydrogenolysis. Thus, l-methoxy-l,3-cyclohexadiene already at 25 C forms a mixture of anisole, 2-cyclohexenone and methane as the major products. The organic medium was found to have a significant effect on both the rate and the nature of the products. The experiments reported in Table 2 indicate that polar solvents promote faster reactions than nonpolar ones, though application of the latter led to higher selectivity. While in nitro- methane and in 1,2-dichloroethane the disproportionation of 1,3-cyclohexa- diene is accompanied by dehydrogenation, in toluene disproportionation was found to take place as the only catalytic process.

As for other processes promoted by the RhCla-ammonium salt ion pair [1, 3, 4], the presence of the water phase proved essential for the catalysis. Thus, when the aqueous layer was removed and the organic solution dried over MgS04, neither disproportionation nor dehydrogenation of the cyclic dienes took place. However, addition of ca. 20 Ml of either HjO or 2- propanol to the organic solution restored the activity of the system. (In the presence of 2-propanol, 55% of the 1,3-cyclohexadiene reacted within 211 100 min to give 75% benzene and 25% cyclohexene.) Since this and other alcohols successfully replaced tl^O, we assume that the latter serves as a hydrogen donor for the formation of the metal hydride required for the initial step of the process {vide infra). Examination of various phase transfer catalysts in reactions 1 and 2 revealed that the onium salts serve not only as extraction agents for the rhodium ion, but act also as ligands having electronic as well as steric effects on the acting catalyst. The data given in Table 3 for disproportionation- dehydrogenation experiments with different phase transfer catalysts indicate variations in the reaction rates in spite of the fact that all the rhodium had been transferred from the aqueous to the organic layer prior to the addition of the unsaturated substrate.

Application of ion pairs formed from Aliquat 336 and transition metal salts other than Rhd3 revealed that none of the complexes derived from RuCl3, IrCIa, K^IrCle, K^PdC^ and I^PtC^ catalyzed reaction (2) at 70 C. The iridium-containing ion pairs proved completely inactive, the ruthenium and platinum compounds promoted only slow dehydrogenation and the palladium system deteriorated upon addition of the cyclic diene. Also some other ionic rhodium compounds (e.g., [Rh(NH2(CH2)3NH2)(cod)]\"''Cr) were found inactive under our experimental conditions. The complex formed from aqueous Rhd3 and Aliquat 336 has already been shown to act as a true catalyst that can be recycled in isomerization of ally lie compounds [3] as well as in some unique transfer hydrogenation processes [4]. However, it was found to serve only as a catalyst precursor which loses halogen ligands during the reduction of olefinic, acetylenic and aromatic C C bonds with molecular hydrogen [1, 5 - 8]. In transformations of cyclic 1,3-dienes, the ion pair behaves as a true catalyst: it does not eliminate chloride ions, and after application it can be recycled by re- extraction into the aqueous phase (eqn. (3)). 212 ^NnRhCLJ-org + X-aq ^ [R4NrX-org + [RhC^-aq (3) Typical ions X~ that were used are CF, Cl0^~, 4-CH3C6H4S03~, BF4\" and [B(C6H5)4]~, of which the latter gave the best results. Application of 2.5 mol NaB(C6H5)4/mol Rh resulted in complete recovery of the rhodium at conversions < 40%. At higher conversions, however, part of the catalyst formed nonionic species which could not be recycled (cf. [3, 4]). Thus, e.g., when the catalytic process was terminated only after 85% conversion, significant losses in activity were observed after each run. Typical reaction profiles for the transformation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene by the RhC^-Aliquat 336 catalyst in the first three runs are shown in Fig. 1. 12 24 36 48 60 Time (mm ) Fig. 1. Conversion-time profiles for disproportionation-dehydrogenation of 1,3-cyclo- hexadiene by RhCl3-Aliquat 336 under the reaction conditions given in the Experi- mental. ( ) First run; (0) second run; (A) third run. Several mechanisms have been proposed for transition-metal catalyzed disproportionation of cyclic dienes. The results in hand may indicate that our catalysis follows a mechanism similar to that suggested by Moseley and Maitlis [9] (Scheme 1). The initial formation of a rhodium hydride a is supported by the following observations: (a) the reaction does not proceed in the absence of an external hydrogen donor, but is initiated by water, alcohols (e.g. 2-propanol), silicon hydrides (e.g. polymethylhydrosiloxane) or brief treatment with molecular hydrogen; (b) the appearance of metal hydride resonance peaks in the 300 MHz 'H NMR spectra of the reaction mixtures under conditions that do not permit dehydrogenation (vide supra). E.g., during the disproportionation of a-terpinene in toluene-water in the presence of [(C8Hl7)3NCH3]+[RhCl4 nH:iO]-, there appeared a triplet at -11.293 (J=6.2 Hz) and a multiplet centered at 11.800 ppm. The rhodium hydride may form a cyclohexadiene complex b that gives an 773 species upon intramolecular hydride transfer. Addition of a second diene molecule followed by similar ligand rearrangements could then yield a cyclohexene-rhodium complex f. Exchange of the coordinated alkene by a new diene molecule should result in formation of free cyclohexene and species g. Finally rearrangement of g to the arene complex h followed by liberation of benzene completes the catalytic cycle with regeneration of b. 213 h g f Scheme 1.
