The synthesis of manganese-cobalt oxide with outstanding activity and selectivity toward benzyl alcohol oxidation using air as oxidant is reported in this work. The as-synthesized catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, N2 physisorption, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Raman Spectroscopy, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy and Temperature Programmed Reduction/Desorption/Oxidation techniques. The catalysts with different Mn/Co ratio show obviously different morphologies and structures. The Mn1Co2 with spinel MnCo2O4 structure exhibits the lowest activation energy, as well as the best performances toward benzyl alcohol oxidation. It is considered that excellent performances is related to the good reducibility and reactivity of oxygen species, oxygen activation ability, in virtue of the close Mn-Co interaction with in the MnCo2O4 structure.

Introduction Aromatic carbonyl compounds are widely used as chemical intermediate in the field of organic synthesis such as pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. These compounds are mainly produced by selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols [1,2]. In contrast to the stoichiometric inorganic oxidants like permanganate and chromate, the use of molecular oxygen or H2O2 as oxidant is considered green and sustainable. [3,4] Because these oxidants are cheap, abundant and clean. Furthermore, molecular oxygen is more desirable, due to the safety issues associated with H2O2 resulting from its high instability. [5,6] But it also means that more severe condition is required when molecular oxygen is used. Therefore, the design of efficient catalysts is of critical importance for the selective oxidation using oxygen or air as oxidant. [5,7-9] The effective catalysts studied include the noble metal based catalyst [10–12] and non-noble transitional metal oxide catalyst [13–20]. By comparison, noble metal catalyst usually exhibit high TOF at relatively mild conditions. Unfortunately, its application is limited by the high cost, susceptible sintering and poisoning. While the transitional metal oxide catalyst, including the oxide of manganese, vanadium, cobalt and iron, is not as active as the noble metal, but it has advantages such as low cost and good stability. Among them, cobalt oxide and manganese oxide is believed to be good candidate [13,14,16]. One of the important reason is that the recycling of cobalt and manganese from large amount of waste battery material has significant environmental and economic benefits. In addition, manganese oxide and cobalt oxide is catalytically active and have been applied in various oxidation reactions. For example, MCM-41 supported manganese oxide with different structures was studied for benzyl alcohol oxidation [16]. The MnOx/MCM-41 with high Mnδ+valence showed good activity owing to the superior reducibility compared with low valence Mnδ+ oxo species. Efforts have also been devoted into optimization of cobalt oxide to improve its performances toward oxidation of alcohols or hydrocarbons. [7,18-20] However, the catalytic activity of these oxide catalyst is still inferior, and thus designing efficient transitional metal oxide catalysts with substantially improved catalytic performances is highly demanded. Compared with single oxide, combination of more than one metal oxides usually exhibits novel physical/chemical properties and better performances in various catalytic applications. [21–28] For the cobalt oxide with formula of Co3O4 displaying spinel structure, Co2+ occupies at the tetrahedral site and the Co3+ locates in the octahedral site. With similar ionic radius, Mn could be introduced into spinel structure of Co3O4. The reconstruction of chemical bond modifies the electronic properties of the binary manganese cobalt oxide, which could have an impact on the catalytic performances [22,23,29]. The work presented here is oriented toward investigation of structure, electronic properties, and catalytic behaviors of a series of manganese and cobalt oxide with different Mn/Co ratios in benzyl alcohol oxidation reactions. The oxides were characterized by XRD, Raman and XPS. The redox properties and oxygen activation abilities were also analyzed. The aim of this work is to gain insight into the relationship among the structural characteristics, physicochemical properties, and catalytic performances of the oxides, and develop non-noble transitional metal oxide as promising catalyst for benzyl alcohol oxidation by molecular oxygen/air. Experimental Catalyst preparation A series of single and mixed manganese cobalt oxide catalysts were synthesized by the procedures described as below. In the first step, appropriate amount of Mn(NO3)2·4H2O and/or Co(NO3)2·6H2O were dissolved in distilled water with vigorous stirring, followed by pouring of urea solution upon stirring. Then, the precipitate produced was then transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 150 °C for 10 h. Subsequently, the cooled product was washed with distilled water and ethanol, and then dried at 100 °C for 12 h. The manganese-cobalt oxides with different nominated Mn/Co ratios of 1/2, 1/1, and 2/1 are labelled as Mn1Co2, Mn1Co1, Mn2Co1, respectively. Catalyst characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiment were performed on a Bruker D8 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation operating at 40 kV and 30 mA over the 2θ range from 5° to 90° at a step of 5°/min. Raman spectra were recorded using Thermo Scientific DXR 2xi Raman microscope in the backscatting configuration with a 532 nm green laser in the range of 50–3400 cm−1 at room temperature. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface areas and pore volumes were determined by N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms conducted on a IQ2 Quantachrome porosimeter instrument at 77 K. The Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) images and Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) results were obtained on a thermo scientific Apreo 2C electronmicroscope equipped with OXFORD ULTIM Max65 spectrometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were carried out on a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi spectrometer equipped with an Al K radiation source. Spectra were analyzed by XPSPEAK, and the binding energies (BE) were calibrated by using C1s peak (BE of 284.6 eV) as standard and quoted with a precision of ±0.2 eV. Temperature-programmed reduction of samples by H2 (H2-TPR) was performed on a Quantachrome ChemStar-TPx Chemisorption Analyzer. Typically, 100 mg of catalysts was loaded into the reactor and pretreated under He (30 mL/min) at 300 °C for 30 min. After being cooled below 50 °C, 10 vol.% H2/He mixture was introduced into the reactor under a temperature-programmed procedures from 50 to 800 °C with a rate of 10 °C/min. Temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen(O2-TPD) followed by subsequent oxidation (TPO) was conducted on BelCata-II chemisorption analyzer. Before measurements, the catalyst was pretreated under Ar (30 mL/min) at 300 °C for 30 min and then cooled to 50 °C. The gas flow of O2 (30 mL/min) was introduced and kept for 30 min. After that, the catalyst was purged with Ar and kept for 30 min to remove the physiosorped O2. The temperature was ramped from 50 to 900 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min, and O2-TPD curve was recorded by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Finally, the TPO curve was further recorded under a flow of 5 vol.% O2/Ar from 50 °C to 900 °C (10 °C/min). Catalytic test The liquid phase oxidation of benzyl alcohol was carried out in a three-necked glass flask equipped with a reflux condenser and magnetic stirrer. Certain amount of catalyst was added into a mixture of benzyl alcohol, DMF (solvent) and n-amyl alcohol (internal standard) upon stirring at desired temperature with bubbling of controlled flow of air to allow the reaction for prescribed length of time. After the reaction, the solid catalyst was separated from the solution by centrifugation. The composition of liquid is analyzed by GC (FULI 9790Plus) with FID detector and FFAP column. Results and discussion Catalyst performance The liquid-phase benzyl alcohol (BzOH) oxidation in air flow over the catalysts (including sole CoOx, Mn1Co2, Mn1Co1, Mn2Co1, and sole MnOx) were studied, with results displayed in Fig. 3. What to be noted is that the benzaldehyde selectivity was always >97 % over all catalysts under the whole reaction conditions studied here. The sole CoOx gives the lowest BzOH conversions of 21.5 %, 32.4 %, 39.2 %, while the sole MnOx gives higher conversions of 62.7 %, 85.7 %, 93.7 % after 2, 5, 7-hour reaction, respectively (Fig. 3a). Most notably, the mixed oxides MnCo catalysts possess obviously higher activity than the sole CoOx and MnOx. In particular, the Mn1Co2 catalyst exhibits the highest activity among these three MnCo catalysts under the identical reaction conditions, giving >90 % BzOH conversion within 2 h. Interestingly, the BzOH conversion is decreased progressively for Mn1Co1 and Mn2Co1, and the conversion is closer and closer to that of sole Mn2O3 (Fig. 3a), likely due to more and more MnOx formed on catalyst surface along with increasing Mn content in these three MnCo catalysts (to be proved by the following results of XRD, Raman, and element analyses). The influences of reaction temperature, air flow rate, and BzOH/catalyst mass ratio on the catalytic performance of Mn1Co2 were further evaluated. The BzOH conversion is increased progressively along with reaction temperature from 60 to 100 °C, and tend to be stabilized with temperature from 100 to 140 °C (Fig. 3b). As observed in Fig. 3c, the air flow rate has less influence than the reaction temperature on BzOH conversion for the Mn1Co2 catalyst. In order to clarify whether the oxygen species is supplied from the originally adsorbed oxygen species on Mn1Co2 surface or the ones from activation of molecular oxygen from air, a control testing was conducted in N2 and air flow (inserted figure in Fig. 3c). Clearly, >90 % BzOH conversion could be obtained in air flow, whereas only 15–20 % conversion in N2 flow, indicating that the presence of air is necessary for the effective oxidation of BzOH. Moreover, the almost unchanged BzOH conversion at different air flow rates further suggests the effective adsorption and activation of molecular oxygen on the Mn1Co2 surface even at 20 mL/min. The increased amount of catalyst undoubtedly promoted the conversion of BzOH (Fig. 3d). Our Mn1Co2 catalyst was compared with the reported typical heterogeneous catalysts for the liquid-phase BzOH oxidation (Table S1). The noble metal-based catalysts generally possess excellent catalytic activity (entries 1–9). For example, Wu et al. reported the excellent activity of Au-Pd nanoparticles anchored on foam-like meso‑SiO2 [10], with 94 % BzOH conversion in a solvent-free system at a low catalyst/BzOH mass ratio (50 mg catalyst vs. 100 mmol BzOH). However, considerable amount of benzoic acid, benzyl benzoate, and benzoin were formed over most noble metal catalysts (entries 1–9). It is exciting to find that the Mn1Co2 performance is much better than that of Rh/C catalyst (entry 7). The non-noble metal catalysts (e.g., supported or unsupported transition metal oxides, hydrotalcite, MOF-derived materials, and N-doped active carbon) were also compared, and except for the La0.9Ce0.1CoO3 (entry 10), other reported non-noble metal catalysts were almost inferior to our Mn1Co2 catalyst (entries 11–18). The La0.9Ce0.1CoO3 gives a 92 % BzOH conversion and >95 % benzaldehyde (BzCHO) selectivity (under the reaction conditions: Cat. 0.05 g, BzOH 0.19 mmol, 88 °C, 1 h, O2 flow of 50 mL/min, toluene 20 mL) [21]; the comparable BzOH conversion and BzCHO selectivity could be obtainable over our Mn1Co2 catalyst under similar reaction conditions (Cat. 0.1 g, BzOH 1 mmol, 100 °C, 2 h, air flow of 50 mL/min, DMF 10 mL). The above comparison shows both promising activity and BzCHO selectivity over our Mn1Co2 catalyst. Structural and textual properties of catalysts In order to obtain the origin to the different catalytic performance, the phases of as-prepared catalysts were initially identified by XRD technique, and their XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 1a . The sole CoOx shows the intense diffraction line that matches well with the cubic spinel Co3O4 (JCPDS-42–1467), while the sole MnOx shows the diffraction line of cubic Mn2O3 (JCPDS-41–1442). The XRD patterns of Mn1Co2 and Mn1Co1 are very close to that of Co3O4, with a small diffraction shift towards the lower angles (as shown in Fig. 1b), suggesting that Mn with larger ionic radius is incorporated into the cubic spinel structure of Co3O4. Further analysis unveils that the patterns of Mn1Co2 and Mn1Co1 could be attributed to the inverse spinel MnCo2O4 [23,29]. As for the Mn2Co1, the diffraction line presents the existence of both MnCo2O4 and Mn2O3. Subsequently, these catalysts were probed by Raman spectra (Fig. 1c). The Co3O4 spectrum corresponds well with the Raman active mode of spinel Co3O4 at 690 (A1g), 618 (F2g), 522 (F2g), 482 (Eg), and 194 (F2g) cm−1 [30]. The Mn1Co2 shows similar but weaker spectrum in comparison to that of Co3O4, again suggesting the successful incorporation of Mn into the spinel Co3O4 structure to form the spinel MnCo2O4. The small shift of the band positions is supposed to be resulted from the different bond length and polyhedral distortion of spinel lattices between Co3O4 and MnCo2O4 [31,32]. With further raising Mn/Co molar ratio to Mn1Co1, the band at ca. 688 cm−1 of MnCo2O4 becomes greatly weakened, whereas a strong band at 616 cm−1 emerges (likely attributed to some small-sized MnOx [29,33], which should be formed on catalyst surface from the excessive Mn). However, no any XRD peak of MnOx is detectable for this catalyst, likely due to the amorphous structure or low-crystallinity of the as-formed MnOx species. For Mn3Co1, its spectrum is close to that of sole Mn2O3 (659 cm−1) with disappearance of MnCo2O4 signal, suggesting the large amount of Mn2O3 formation on the catalyst surface. The textual properties of all catalysts were analyzed by N2-sorption isotherms, which are displayed in Fig. 1d. All the samples exhibit the characteristics of type-IV isotherms, with a hysteresis loop appearing in higher P/P0 region, indicating the mesoporous structure. The specific surface area and pore volume data are listed in Table 1 . The Co3O4 has a surface area of 71.5 m2/g and total pore volume of 0.19 mL/g. With the incorporation of Mn, the surface area is reduced to 62.9 m2/g, but the pore volume is increased to 0.46 mL/g for Mn1Co2. With further increasing Mn content, both surface area and pore volume are decreased for Mn1Co1 (55.0 m2/g, 0.28 mL/g) and Mn2Co1 (44.7 m2/g, 0.14 mL/g). The Mn2O3 has a relatively low surface area and pore volume of 48.3 m2/g and 0.18 mL/g, respectively. Moreover, the data in Table 1 also show that the pore volume of all catalysts are dominated with mesopore volume. The SEM images of all catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 . The sole Co3O4 exhibits the folding fan-like morphology with dozens of micrometers length (Fig. 2a). With the incorporation of Mn, the spheres of 10–30 μm are formed for the MnCo samples with ever-denser morphology: the Mn1Co2 sphere has a diameter of 10 μm with the fluffy morphology (Fig. 2b); the Mn1Co1 sphere has a diameter of 8–10 μm with the denser morphology of broccoli (Fig. 2c); the Mn2Co1 sphere has a ca. 30 μm diameter with the dense morphology of stacking-cuboids (Fig. 2d). Entirely differently, the Mn2O3 shows a cubic-bulk morphology (Fig. 2e). These above ever-denser morphologies from Co3O4 to MnCo and to Mn2O3 are well consistent with their ever-decreasing surface areas (Table 1). The EDS mappings display that the Co, Mn and O elements are homogeneously distributed in these three MnCo catalysts (Fig. 2f-h). Moreover, the element analyses by XPS also suggest that the Mn At.% are progressively increased from Mn1Co2 to Mn1Co1 and to Mn2Co1 (Table 2 ), which coincides with the Raman spectra (i.e., more and more MnOx are formed on the catalyst surface from Mn1Co2 to Mn1Co1 and to Mn2Co1; Fig. 1c). The combination of XRD, Raman, N2-sorption, SEM, and element analyses consistently identify that: the sole cobalt oxide is Co3O4 and sole manganese oxide is Mn2O3; Mn1Co2 is composed of dominant inverse spinel MnCo2O4; Mn1Co1 is composed of MnCo2O4 and some small-size MnOx formed on catalyst surface, while Mn2Co1 is of MnCo2O4 and large amount of Mn2O3 formed on catalyst surface; finally, the morphologies from Co3O4 to MnCo catalysts and to Mn2O3 become more and more denser. Surface properties of catalysts The catalyst-surface compositions were characterized by XPS, and Fig. 4 shows their XPS spectra in Mn2p, Co2p and O1s regions. In the Co2p spectra for all Co-containing catalyst samples (Fig. 4a), two spin-orbit doublets corresponding to Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2, as well as two satellite peaks were observed. For the sole Co3O4 sample, the spin-orbit splitting of Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 for Co3O4 is about 15.2 eV, which is identical to the value that was reported for Co3O4 phase, and the shake-up satellite peak located at 788.6 eV is also characteristic of Co3O4 phase [34]. With the incorporation of Mn, the binding energies of Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 shift to higher values. In addition, the deconvolution results of Co2p further demonstrate that the Co2+/Co3+ ratio is 1.1 for sole Co3O4 sample, but is progressively decreased in the order of Co3O4>Mn1Co2>Mn2Co1>Mn1Co1, possibly resulting from the formation of MnCo2O4 as well as the strong interactions between MnOx and CoOx units. The Mn2p spectra are also composed of two main spin-orbital signals (Fig. 4b). For the sole Mn2O3 sample, the Mn2p3/2 and Mn2p1/2 peaks are respectively located at ∼642 and ∼653.7 eV, with splitting energy of 11.7 eV, similar to the reported value for Mn2O3 [22]. The deconvolution analysis of the Mn2p spectra was not performed due to the overlapping of the binding energies of Mn with different oxidation states. However, compared with the sole Mn2O3 sample, the Mn2p3/2 peaks slightly shift to lower binding energy for the mixed oxide MnCo catalysts and such shift could be ascribed to the presence of Mn2+. Based on above results, one can assume that the introduction of Mn results in the following redox reaction upon MnCo2O4 formation (i.e., Mn3+ + Co2+ → Mn2+ + Co3+) [35], which also portends the strong interactions between MnOx and CoOx. The O1s spectra of all catalysts are displayed in Fig. 4c. The two asymmetric signals could be fitted into two components: the one at lower binding energy of 529∼530 eV is ascribed to the stoichiometric oxygen that bonded with Mn or Co (or lattice oxygen, Oα), and the other one at higher binding energy corresponds to the adsorbed oxygen species (Oβ). Quantitative analysis shows that the amounts of surface adsorbed oxygen species for the Mn-containing catalysts are higher than that for the sole Co3O4 sample. Combining the information that the Mn-containing catalysts give higher catalytic performance than the sole Co3O4, it could be inferred that the surface adsorbed oxygen species is important for benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzaldehyde. However, one point to be more noticeable is that the MnCo-catalysts with Mn-Co interactions deliver higher catalytic performance than the sole Mn2O3 sample, despite that the sole Mn2O3 possesses the most abundant adsorbed oxygen species. This further indicates that the Mn-Co interactions may be more important for this reaction than the surface adsorbed oxygen species. Reducibility and O2-activation ability of catalysts To elucidate the Mn-Co-interaction-dependent properties of active oxygen species (such as reducibility or oxidative activity of oxygen species, and activation ability toward molecular oxygen over catalyst surface), H2-TPR and O2-TPD followed by sequential TPO experiments have been performed. According to Fig. 5 , the reduction of sole Co3O4 proceeds via two steps: corresponding to the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO at 296 °C, followed by CoO to metallic Co at 363 °C; the lower intensity of the first peak is in accordance with the stepwise reduction behavior of Co3O4. [23,36-38] The Mn2O3 also displays two reduction peaks at 293 and 456 °C, and the first peak is attributed to the reduction of Mn2O3 to Mn3O4, and the second one is resulted from the further reduction of Mn3O4 to MnO [39]. The reduction behavior of different MnCo catalysts varies largely depending on the Mn/Co ratio. The Mn2Co1 shows similar reduction pattern with Mn2O3 but with slightly lower reduction temperature. Obviously differently, multiple reduction peaks are observed for the Mn1Co1 and Mn1Co2 catalysts, possibly caused by the reduction of Mn3+/Mn2+ and Co3+/Co2+ in different structural and chemical environments. In particular, the Mn1Co2 catalyst gives the reduction at lowest temperature among all catalysts, which indicates the highest reducibility or oxidative activity of oxygen species over this catalyst and coincides well with its highest catalytic performance. The O2-TPD and TPO curves of the catalysts ae shown in Fig. 6 . No obvious desorption peak was observed for Co3O4 until approximately 716 °C (Fig. 6a) [40]. The peak desorbed at high temperature should be attributed to the evolution of lattice oxygen. Different from the Co3O4, the O2-TPD pattern of the Mn2O3 displays an additional desorption peak at lower temperature, indicating the presence of abundant adsorbed oxygen species. This result is consistent with that reported by O1s. For the Mn1Co2 catalyst, the weak and broad signal starting from 410 °C should also be resulted from adsorbed oxygen species. While the shoulder peak on the left side of the major peak in the desorption pattern of Mn1Co1 and Mn2Co1 suggested small amount of adsorbed oxygen species presented over the surface. On the other hand, the TPO results (Fig. 6b) demonstrated that Co3O4 consumed the largest amount of oxygen after O2-TPD process. The large O2 consumption mainly comes from the reoxidation at higher temperature as a result of evolution of lattice oxygen during O2-TPD. The amount of oxygen consumption decreased with the increasing incorporation of Mn. It was noted that the activation of O2 over Mn2O3 seemed to be more difficult compared with the others, as suggested by the higher starting temperature of oxidation in the TPO pattern. This should be responsible for the moderate activity of Mn2O3, despite of the rich reactive oxygen species presented. As a whole, the Mn1Co2 catalyst delivers the excellent catalytic performance, relevant to both the good oxygen activation ability and reactive oxygen species. This should be originated from the strong Mn-Co interactions lying in the unique structure of inverse spinel MnCo2O4 phase. Moreover, the intrinsic activities of the different MnCo catalysts were further probed by carrying out kinetics study. Based on the Arrhenius plots with BzOH conversion lower than 20 %, the apparent activation energies of these catalysts were calculated. The lowest activation energy of 22.0 kJ mol−1 was obtained for the Mn1Co2 catalysts, indicating that it is much easier to proceed benzyl alcohol oxidation over Mn1Co2. In general, reaction mechanism of the oxidation over metal oxide follows either Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) mechanism involving chemically adsorbed oxygen species or Mars–van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism involving lattice oxygen [41]. As the reaction was carried out at relatively lower temperature (∼100 °C), the lattice oxygen species can hardly participate into the oxidation (suggested by TPR and TPO results). Furthermore, there was a great difference in conversion between that performed under air and nitrogen (>90 % v.s. <20 %). It was supposed that l-H mechanism dominated in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol oxidation under the conditions of this study. According to the l-H mechanism, benzyl alcohol was oxidized by chemically adsorbed oxygen species, which was generated by activation of molecular oxygen via O2 ↔ O2 − ↔ O2 2− ↔ O − over the surface, especially over the oxygen vacancies. With introduction of Mn, more oxygen vacancies were generated, promoting the conversion of benzyl alcohol. Moreover, compared with normal spinel Co3O4 (CoTd[Co2]OctO4), half of Co3+ cation are replaced by Mn3+ cation in inverse-spinel MnCo2O4 (CoTd[MnCo]OctO4). The short B-B bond length in the MnCo2O4 facilitate the electron transfer and enhanced the catalytic performances. With further increasing Mn content, the activation capability toward molecular oxygen weakened, being responsible for the decreased performances. Conclusions In this work, a series of manganese cobalt oxides with different Mn/Co ratios have been synthesized and used in the liquid phase oxidation of benzyl alcohol with air. Compared with the single oxide, the binary oxide showed enhanced activity and selectivity. Among them, the Mn1Co2 catalyst exhibits the most outstanding performances. Structure characterizations showed that Mn1Co2 is composed of dominant MnCo2O4 with inverse spinel structure. The XPS and O2-TPD results both showed that the amount of reactive oxygen species of Mn1Co2 is not the most abundant. But the strong Mn-Co interactions lying inverse spinel MnCo2O4 structure promoted the reducibility and reactivity of oxygen species, as well as oxygen activation ability. These contributed to the excellent performance of Mn1Co2 catalyst toward benzyl alcohol oxidation.

        "dc:description": "The synthesis of manganese-cobalt oxide with outstanding activity and selectivity toward benzyl alcohol oxidation using air as oxidant is reported in this work. The as-synthesized catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, N2 physisorption, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Raman Spectroscopy, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy and Temperature Programmed Reduction/Desorption/Oxidation techniques. The catalysts with different Mn/Co ratio show obviously different morphologies and structures. The Mn1Co2 with spinel MnCo2O4 structure exhibits the lowest activation energy, as well as the best performances toward benzyl alcohol oxidation. It is considered that excellent performances is related to the good reducibility and reactivity of oxygen species, oxygen activation ability, in virtue of the close Mn-Co interaction with in the MnCo2O4 structure.",
