Electrocatalytic oxidation of cyclohexanol on a nickel oxyhydroxide modified nickel electrode in alkaline solutions Qingfeng Yi ⁎ Jingjing Zhang Wu Huang Xiaoping Liu School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hunan University of Science and Technology, Xiangtan 411201, China ⁎ Corresponding author. Electrocatalytic oxidation of cyclohexanol was investigated with cyclic voltammograms, linear galvanic voltammograms and chronoamperometric responses on a nickel oxyhydroxide modified nickel (NOMN) electrode prepared by cycling the potential of a nickel electrode in the potential range of 0.1V to 0.6V (vs SCE) in alkaline solutions. It was found that cyclohexanol was oxidized by NiOOH generated with further electrochemical oxidation of nickel hydroxide during the anodic potential sweep. One of the products of the reaction between cyclohexanol and NiOOH was Ni(OH)2 which was subsequently oxidized to NiOOH on the anode. This resulted in the appearance of a new anodic peak in cyclic voltammograms compared with the absence of cyclohexanol and this anodic peak strongly depends upon potential scan rates and cyclohexanol concentrations. In addition, the presence of cyclohexanol in NaOH solutions also lead to the decrease of anodic potentials in linear galvanic voltammetric responses and the increase of current densities in chronoamperometric curves. Results showed that the oxidation of cyclohexanol on the NOMN electrode follows the catalytic reaction mechanism. Keywords Nickel oxyhydroxide Cyclohexanol oxidation Cyclic voltammetry Electrocatalysis 1 Introduction Nickel is economically feasible with good electrocatalytic activity for alkaline batteries and organic oxidation. In the last several decades, its applications have attracted the attention of many researchers either to study the behavior of nickel electrode itself [1,2] or its electrochemical reactivity towards many other molecules [3–6]. Czerwinski et al. [7] has studied the electrochemical performance of nickel deposited on a reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) in KOH solutions. Their results indicated that Ni/RVC saturated with Ni(OH)2 shows behavior similar or even better than that of sintered Ni saturated with Ni(OH)2. Liu et al. [5] has studied the physical and electrochemical characteristics of aluminium-substituted nickel hydroxide. Since the 1970s, oxidation of organic compounds on the nickel electrode in alkaline solutions has been extensively investigated. Khalil et al. [8] has studied nickel impregnated silicalite-1 as an electro-catalyst for methanol oxidation. Jafarian et al. [2] has reported the electrochemical oxidation behavior of methanol on a Ni electrode . In addition, Ni(III) was used to oxidize methanol and it was found that the final oxidation product of methanol is acetic acid [9]. Also, it was demonstrated by Kauler and Schagfer [10] that Ni(OH)2/NiOOH couple can be applied in the electro-oxidation of some organic compounds. In this redox couple nickel oxyhydroxide was found to be a convenient and useful oxidant for obtaining carboxylic acids or carbonyl compounds from the corresponding alcohols [9–12]. As an oxidation product of cyclohexanol, cyclohexene or cyclohexanone, adipic acid has been widely used not only as an important intermediate in the manufacture of nylon but also as a plasticizer and a food additive. Therefore, researchers are interested in the development of simple and environmentally friendly methods of its synthesis. Sato et al. [13] reported a “Green” route to synthesize adipic, i.e. the direct oxidation of cyclohexene to adipic acid using hydrogen peroxide (30%) as an oxidation agent. Beziat et al. [14] demonstrated that a carbon-supported platinum catalyst was an effective heterogeneous catalyst for liquid phase oxidation of cyclohexanol into adipic acid. Chavan et al. [15] proposed a non-HNO3 route to synthesize adipic acid with the oxidation of cyclohexane, cyclohexanone, and cyclohexanol in the presence of Co/Mn cluster complexes. Electrosynthesis of adipic acid from cyclohexanol in an undivided cell was carried out by Lyalin and Petrosyan [16]. Since cyclohexanol is an important material used in the production of adipic acid, it is worth studying the reaction mechanism of electro-oxidation of cyclohexanol. The purpose of the present work is to investigate the electrochemical oxidation of cyclohexanol on nickel oxyhydroxide modified nickel (NOMN) electrode in alkaline solutions at room temperature. 2 Experimental details All chemicals used in this work were reagent grade products and used without further purifications. Cyclohexanol and sodium hydroxide were purchased from Sinopharm Group Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. Water was doubly distilled. The working electrodes were made of sheets of analytical grade (99.995%) nickel exposing geometric surface areas of 0.1cm2. Prior to the modification of the electrode, the nickel sheets had been polished with a diamond compound paste (01# and 06#) to mirror bright, then washed with acetone, dilute hydrochloric acid and double distilled water, successively. All electrochemical experiments were performed in a conventional three electrode cell powered by a CS300 Corrtest electrochemical system. A large platinum sheet was used as a counter electrode. A saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was a reference electrode. All potentials were measured with respect to the SCE which was positioned as close to the working electrode as possible by means of a Luggin capillary. The modified electrodes were prepared by cycling the potential of the working electrode in the range of 0.1–0.6V (vs SCE) at a scan rate of 100mV/s for 750 cycles. Electrochemical methods used in this work included cyclic voltammograms, linear galvanic voltammograms and chronoamperometric measurements. Unless otherwise specified, experiments were performed using 1M NaOH as a background electrolyte. Before measurements, solutions were deaerated by bubbling high-purity nitrogen (99.999%) for at least 20min. All experiments were performed at ambient temperature (20±2°C). 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 A shows 750 consecutive cyclic voltammograms(CVs) of a nickel electrode in 1M NaOH solution recorded at a potential sweep rate of 100mV/s, and Fig. 1B represents the first and the last scan CVs in Fig. 1A. It can be seen from Fig. 1A and B that during consecutive potential-sweeping cycles, both anodic and cathodic current densities increase progressively. Changes in the current density of the peaks are likely due to the changes in the crystal structures of the nickel hydroxide and the nickel oxyhydroxide [17]. Fig. 1 also shows that in the early sweeps, one anodic peak a1 appears at 360mV and only one cathodic peak c1 at the cathodic half cycle is observed at 275mV. However, a new cathodic peak c2 develops at 215mV position after prolonged cycling. Electrochemical behavior corresponding to the two peaks a1 and c1 is attributed to the redox couple Ni2+/Ni3+ according to: [1–3,12,17]: (1) Ni(OH)2 +OH− →NiOOH+H2O+e− In addition, it is seen from Fig. 1 that the potential of the anodic peak a1 becomes more positive with the increase of cycling. As has been reported [18–21], nickel hydroxide may generally exist in two different crystallographic forms designed α-Ni(OH)2 and β-Ni(OH)2 which are hydrous and anhydrous, respectively. In addition [21,22], the oxidation of nickel hydroxide gives two other varieties of oxyhydroxides, β and γ, which explains the existence of the two reduction peaks during the backward sweep. The α-form is known to be unstable, and when α-Ni(OH)2 is formed at the initial stage of electro-oxidation of the Ni electrode, it is further slowly converted to the β-Ni(OH)2. It was reported by Desilvestro et al. [23,24] that both the electrodeposited nickel hydroxide and nickel oxyhydroxide phases are believed to be un-stoichiometric. Therefore, the peak potentials change with the increase of cycling numbers. Fig. 2 shows CVs of a freshly prepared NOMN electrode from 0–0.6V at various potential sweep rates of 5–200mV/s in 1M NaOH solution. As the scan rate increases, the anodic peak potentials shift to more positive and the cathodic peak potentials are converted to a slightly negative direction. Fig. 3 indicates the plot of the anodic peak current density I pa in Fig. 2 against the square root of the scan rate v 1/2. As can be seen from Fig. 3 that the anodic peak current densities I pa are well linearly proportional to v 1/2, showing the dominance of the diffusion-controlled process. Effect of the presence of cyclohexanol in 1M NaOH on anodic potentials of the NOMN electrode is represented in Fig. 4 . When current density is less than around 2.5mA/cm2, curves I and II are overlaid, signifying that there is no oxidation reaction of cyclohexanol in the current density range of 0–2.5mA/cm2. However, when the current density is higher than 2.5mA/cm2, their potentials become different and potentials in the absence of cyclohexanol are much higher than those in the presence of cyclohexanol. This indicates that the presence of cyclohexanol can remove the insulated NiOOH deposited on the surface of Ni electrode because of the reaction between NiOOH and cyclohexanol: (2) NiOOH+org1→org2+Ni(OH)2 where org1 represents cyclohexanol and org2 the product of cyclohexanol oxidized. In addition, Ni(OH)2 can be easily formed in an alkaline solution according to (3) Ni+2OH− →Ni(OH)2 +2e− It can be seen from reactions (1)–(3) that NiOOH can be considered as an intermediate if cyclohexanol is present in the solution. The curve I in Fig. 4 can be divided into three parts: one is in the range of the current density 0–2.5mA/cm2, another in the range of 2.5–16mA/cm2 and the third over 16mA/cm2. The first part might be related to the electrochemical dissolution of the Ni electrode. The second is corresponding to reaction (1), i.e. the formation of NiOOH. This results in the quicker increase of potentials. When the surface of the electrode is totally covered with the NiOOH , the potential increases slowly with the current density as shown in the third part. However, curve II always displays a slow increase of the anodic potential at the current density over 2.5mA/cm2, showing the removal of the NiOOH by reaction (2). In order to further clarify the electrochemical oxidation mechanism of cyclohexanol on the NOMN, effect of cyclohexanol concentrations and potential scan rates on cyclic voltammetric responses is investigated. Fig. 5 is the typical cyclic voltammograms on the NOMN electrode in the absence (I) and the presence (II) of cyclohexanol recorded at the potential sweep rate of 5mV/s in the 1M NaOH solution. It is shown from curves I and II in Fig. 5 that an increment of the current density in the anodic peak a1 followed by the appearance of a new peak a2 at more positive potential and a decrease in the cathodic peak in the backward sweep are observed. It might be concluded from the appearance of the new anodic peak that cyclohexanol oxidation takes place after the oxidation reaction (1). In other words, the new anodic peak a2 results from the anodic oxidation of Ni(OH)2 formed from reaction (2). Crystallographic form of this Ni(OH)2, represented by β, is different from that of the α-Ni(OH)2 involved in the anodic peak a1. The corresponding electrode reaction involved in the anodic peak a2 might be (4) β-Ni(OH)2 +OH− →NiOOH+H2O+e− Therefore, the Ni(OH)2 produced in reaction (2) might be β-Ni(OH)2 [2]. This is consistent with different redox potentials of α-Ni(OH)2/NiOOH and β-Ni(OH)2/NiOOH [25], i.e. α-Ni(OH)2 is converted to NiOOH at a lower potential than β-Ni(OH)2 to NiOOH. Further insight into the electrochemical oxidation mechanism of cyclohexanol is indicated in Figs. 6–8 . Fig. 6 presents the typical CVs of the NOMN electrode in the range of 0–0.5V at the scan rate of 5mv/s. The concentration of cyclohexanol in 1M NaOH solution is changed from 0M to 0.25M. It is observed from Fig. 6 that as the cyclohexanol concentration increases, the current densities of both anodic peak a1 (assigned to the couple α-Ni(OH)2/NiOOH) and a2 (assigned to β-Ni(OH)2/NiOOH) increase in the forward sweep while the current densities of the cathodic peak (assigned to NiOOH reduction) decrease in the reverse sweep. Increasing concentration of cyclohexanol makes more NiOOH to be consumed through reaction (2). This is favorable for reaction (1) to take place at higher rates (current densities). Also, reaction (4) will proceed at higher current densities because more β-Ni(OH)2 is to be oxidized. In addition, the decrease of the cathodic peak current density is attributed to the consumption of the NiOOH produced during the forward potential scan because a lot of the NiOOH are transferred into the β-Ni(OH)2 by reaction (2). However, the reduction of NiOOH is likely a slow electrode reaction. This results in the less dependence of the decrease in the cathodic peak current on the cyclohexanol concentration. Therefore, it is seen from Fig. 6 that the relative decrease of the cathodic peak current density due to the increase in cyclohexanol concentration doesn’t match with the large increase of the current density of the anodic peak. Fig. 7 shows the dependance of concentrations of cyclohexanol on CVs on the NOMN electrode at the scan rate of 1mV/s. It is observed from Fig. 7 that when cyclohexanol concentration increases, the current density of the peak a2 increases significantly while the peak a1 decreases and even disappears when the concentration of cyclohexanol reaches 0.25M. This result shows that if the potential scan rate is very slow and cyclohexanol concentration is high enough, much more β-Ni(OH)2 is generated through reaction (2) and subsequently, the current density of the peak a2 increases considerably, as shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 8 exhibits the strong dependence of the peak a2 on the potential scan rate. The peak a2 only arises at very low scan rates and it disappears at higher scan rates. This means that the reaction (2) is not so fast that it doesn’t match with reaction (1). Therefore, the anodic current is mainly contributed by reaction (1). As a result, the peak a2 reduces with the increase of scan rates and finally disappears at the sweep rate of 40mV/s. The above analysis for the electrochemical oxidation mechanism of cyclohexanol is further supported by chronoamperometric measurements indicated in Fig. 9 . The potentials applied are 0.356V and 0.424V which are close to those of anodic peaks a1 and a2 respectively. Fig. 9 shows that compared with the absence of cyclohexanol, much larger increase of the current density at 0.424V is observed than that at 0.356V in the presence of 0.25M cyclohexanol. This is consistent with the analysis for Figs. 6–8. On the basis of the above discussion, we come to the conclusion that the Ni electrode modified with NiOOH has high electrocatalysis for oxidation of cyclohexanol in an alkaline solution. The reaction between NiOOH and cyclohexanol is a slow process and a rate-determining step for the electro-oxidation of cyclohexanol on the NOMN electrode. The redox couple Ni2+/Ni3+ has played a mediate role on heterogeneous catalytic-oxidation of cyclohexanol. In the redox system, α-Ni(OH)2 is firstly oxidized to NiOOH through the electrode reaction (1) in an alkaline medium; then the generated NiOOH is reduced to β-Ni(OH)2 by cyclohexanol through reaction (2). Subsequently, this β-Ni(OH)2 is converted to NiOOH at higher potentials, leading to the appearance of a new anodic peak. During the backward sweep, Ni(OH)2 is regenerated by the reduction of NiOOH according to: (5) NiOOH+H2O+e− →Ni(OH)2 +OH− Therefore, the electrochemical oxidation of cyclohexanol on the NOMN electrode follows the catalytic reaction mechanism [26]. Electrochemical oxidation processes of cyclohexanol on the NOMN electrode can be exhibited in Fig. 10 . 4 Summary A nickel electrode modified with a NiOOH film has been prepared in an alkaline solution using cyclic voltammograms. This NOMN electrode is found to be an effective catalyst for cyclohexanol oxidation. The electro-oxidation of cyclohexanol on the NOMN electrode in alkaline solutions follows the catalytic reaction mechanism. Firstly, Ni(OH)2 is electrochemically oxidized to NiOOH; then, cyclohexanol is oxidized by the NiOOH and then the latter is reduced to β-Ni(OH)2; subsequently, the β-Ni(OH)2 is further electro-oxidized to NiOOH at higher anodic potentials; finally, Ni(OH)2 is regenerated by the reduction of the NiOOH in the reverse sweep. This catalytic reaction mechanism is investigated using cyclic voltammograms, linear galvanic voltammetric measurements and chronoamperometric responses. Cyclic voltammetric characteristics of the NOMN in the presence of cyclohexanol strongly depend on potential scan rates and cyclohexanol concentrations. The oxidation reaction of cyclohexanol with NiOOH is a slow process. Acknowledgements This work has been supported by a Grant from the Science and Technology Department of Hunan Province (05FJ3052).
