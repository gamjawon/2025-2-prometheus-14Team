The activity of sup- ported Pt catalysts (Pt/Al 2 O 3 , Pt/ZrO 2 , Pt/TiO 2 , and Pt/H-ZSM-5) depends on the metal oxide support. Pt/Al 2 O 3 showed the highest catalytic activity when the catalysts were aged at 750 qC for 50 h in air. The activity of Pt/Al 2 O 3 was dependent on the valence state of the Pt surface. Pt/Al 2 O 3 with the Pt surface in the metallic state was more active than with the surface in the cationic state. The surface density of acid and basic sites on the Al 2 O 3 support controlled the valence state of the Pt surface and stability of the Pt particles in the highly dispersed state, respectively. Key words: diesel oxidation catalyst; platinum; alumina; valence state of platinum surface; surface acid-base property A diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) is used for the total oxi- dation of CO, unburned hydrocarbons (HCs), and soluble organic fraction (SOF) of particulates in a diesel exhaust [1â€“3]. The DOC is also used to burn a large amount of fuel, which are periodically supplied by post-injection, in order to raise the soot oxidation temperature for the regeneration of the diesel particulate filter (DPF) [4]. A large amount of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) in the system is applied to efficiently lower NO x from the engine, so the temperature of the exhaust gas from the diesel engine is low. Therefore, the DOC is re- quired to oxidize CO and HCs completely at low temperatures. In order to satisfy this requirement, relatively large amounts of Pt are used for the DOC. However, the use of minimal Pt is now receiving extensive attention because the demand for Pt for automotive catalysts is growing due to increasing envi- ronmental awareness [5]. Extensive research have been performed to improve the ac- tivity and durability of a DOC, e.g., the chemical deactivation of supported Pt DOC catalysts by sulfur oxide and contami- nants like phosphorus, zinc and calcium from lubricant oil has been extensively studied to get information for the develop- ment of a highly durable DOC [6â€“8]. Recently, Aluha et al. [9] reported that a Pt-Pd bimetallic catalyst supported on Al 2 O 3 modified with MoO 3 showed high catalytic activity for CO and C 3 H 8 oxidation even in the presence of 20 ppm SO 2 . Diehl et al. [10] studied the total oxidation of 48 hydrocarbons over Pt/Al 2 O 3 and reported that light alkenes were much more re- active than light alkanes, while the opposite was observed with long chain hydrocarbons. Although many research works have been performed to improve the supported Pt catalysts, fewer studies have been performed to understand the essential fea- tures in the catalysis by supported Pt catalysts that can lead to significant improvement of the catalytic performance. In the present work, we investigated in detail the catalytic perform- ance of Pt-based catalysts for the total oxidation of HCs in order to gain knowledge that will be useful for the use of minimal Pt for the DOC. 1 Experimental 1.1 Preparation of the samples Supported Pt (1 wt%) catalysts were prepared by the im- pregnation of metal oxide supports (Al 2 O 3 (Sosol), ZrO 2 (Daiichi Kigenso Kagaku Kogyo Co., Ltd., RSC-H), TiO 2 (Degussa, P-25), H-ZSM-5 (Tosoh, HSZ-830NHA, Si/Al 2 = 28)) with a solution of Pt(NO 2 ) 2 (NH 3 ) 2 (Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo; Pt: 4.595 wt% in solution). Four different Al 2 O 3 Masaaki HANEDA et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 777â€“781 (Al 2 O 3 -A: Sasol; Al 2 O 3 -B: Mizusawa Chemicals, GP-20; Al 2 O 3 -C: Sumitomo Chemical, NK-324; Al 2 O 3 -D: JRC- ALO-8), which have different physicochemical properties, were used. The catalyst precursors obtained were dried and then calcined at 600 qC for 5 h in air (fresh sample). The catalyst samples were further calcined at 750 qC for 50 h in air (aged sample). 1.2 Characterization of the samples The BET surface area of the samples was determined using a volumetric adsorption apparatus (Quantachrome, Nova-4200e) by N 2 adsorption at â€“196 qC. The dispersion of Pt was calcu- lated from CO chemisorption measured by the pulse method at 50 qC. Before the measurement, the sample was first reduced with H 2 at 400 qC for 1 h and then cooled to 50 qC in flowing He. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of adsorbed CO, used as the probe molecule, were obtain with a flow of 0.5% CO-99.5% He at 50 qC over the catalyst with a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer at a resolution of 4 cm â€“1 . A self-supporting sample disk of 14 mg/cm 2 placed in an IR cell with CaF 2 windows was used. This was pretreated at 500 qC in a flow of 10% O 2 -90% He and then cooled to 50 qC in the same at- mosphere. Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH 3 -TPD) and CO 2 (CO 2 -TPD) were performed using a TPD-1-AT-SP (Bell Japan Inc.) to estimate the acid and basic sites, respectively, on Al 2 O 3 . The catalyst sample was pre- treated in a flow of He at 600 qC. After cooling to 100 qC in flowing He, ammonia adsorption was carried out by passing a gas mixture of 0.5% NH 3 -99.5% He through the sample bed at 100 qC for 1 h. CO 2 adsorption was carried out by passing a gas mixture of 0.5% CO 2 -99.5% He through the sample bed at 50 qC for 1 h. After the adsorption gas was purged with He to remove physically adsorbed ammonia and CO 2 at each ad- sorption temperature, NH 3 -TPD and CO 2 -TPD measurements were carried out by heating to 600 qC at a heating rate of 10 qC/min in flowing He at a flow rate of 60 cm 3 /min. A quadru- pole mass spectrometer was used to measure the desorbed ammonia. 1.3 Activity test The catalytic activity was evaluated using a fixed-bed con- tinuous flow reactor. A reaction gas mixture containing NO (200 ppm), n-decane (1780 ppm C), 1-methylnaphthalene (220 ppm C), O 2 (5%), and H 2 O (10%) diluted in He as the balance gas was fed to a catalyst sample (10 mg), which had been pretreated in situ in a flow of 5% O 2 -95% He at 500 qC for 1 h at a flow rate of 100 cm 3 /min. The activity was measured while decreasing the temperature from 500 to 100 qC at a rate of 2 qC/min. The effluent gas was analyzed by two online gas chromatographs equipped, respectively, with a Molecular Sieve 5A column (for the analysis of CO) and a Porapak Q column (for the analysis of CO 2 ). 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Activity of the samples In the present study, a mixture of n-decane and 1-methyl- naphthalene was employed as the hydrocarbon source. We have measured the activity of the supported Pt catalysts for the oxidation of n-decane in another set of experiment and found that n-decane was oxidized at lower temperatures than 1-methylnaphthalene for all the supported Pt catalysts tested (results not shown). In order to simulate a diesel exhaust, the reaction gas with NO included was used. The selective reduc- tion of NO with HCs occurred at the temperatures at which the oxidation of HCs began. The presence of NO did not affect the activity of the supported Pt catalysts for the total oxidation of HCs (results not shown).

Masaaki HANEDA et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 777â€“781 (fresh sample) for the total oxidation of HCs. Pt/TiO 2 was the least active catalyst, while Pt/Al 2 O 3 , Pt/ZrO 2 , and Pt/H-ZSM-5 showed similar catalytic activities. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 1(b), when the catalysts were aged at 750 qC for 50 h, a decrease of the catalytic activity was observed for all the catalysts. Among the catalysts tested, Pt/Al 2 O 3 showed the highest catalytic activity. This showed that Pt/Al 2 O 3 was rela- tively stable under high temperature aging. 2.2 Characterization results Table 1 gives a summary of the BET surface area and Pt dispersion of fresh and aged catalysts. Since significant de- creases in Pt dispersion after aging were observed, the decrease in catalytic activity can be ascribed to the sintering of Pt par- ticles. However, no clear correlation between Pt dispersion and catalytic activity was observed. That is, Pt/ZrO 2 which has the highest Pt dispersion (CO/Pt = 0.24) exhibited a lower catalytic activity than Pt/Al 2 O 3 (CO/Pt = 0.01). This suggested that the metal oxide support played an important role in the total oxi- dation of HCs. In order to understand the effect of the metal oxide support, Pt/Al 2 O 3 catalysts were prepared using four different Al 2 O 3 supports. Their catalytic activity and physical properties were measured. Figure 2 shows the activity of the four Pt/Al 2 O 3 catalysts for the total oxidation of HCs. Table 2 gives a sum- mary of the BET surface area and Pt dispersion of the Pt/Al 2 O 3 samples. Although Pt/Al 2 O 3 -A and Pt/Al 2 O 3 -D have similar BET surface areas, the Pt dispersion was higher on Pt/Al 2 O 3 -D than on Pt/Al 2 O 3 -A. As can be seen in Fig. 2, Pt/Al 2 O 3 -D showed a higher activity than Pt/Al 2 O 3 -A, suggesting the im- portance of Pt dispersion on the activity for the total oxidation of HCs. On the other hand, the activity of Pt/Al 2 O 3 -B was higher than that of Pt/Al 2 O 3 -C although their Pt dispersions were similar. In order to clarify the importance of the Pt dis- persion, the TOF (expressed as moles of CO 2 formed per mole of surface Pt atoms per minute) was calculated for 230 qC. As shown in Table 2, the TOF values differ and depended on the Al 2 O 3 support employed. Pt/Al 2 O 3 -A gave a relatively high TOF value, while Pt/Al 2 O 3 -C gave a low TOF value. Similar TOF values were obtained for Pt/Al 2 O 3 -B and Pt/Al 2 O 3 -D. These results suggested that the activity of Pt/Al 2 O 3 was de- pendent on not only the Pt dispersion but also other features of the Al 2 O 3 support. Since Al 2 O 3 itself did not show oxidation activity (results not shown), Pt was the catalytically active component for the total oxidation of HCs. The HC oxidation activity of supported Pt is known to depend on the valence state of its surface [11,12]. In order to characterize the valence state of the Pt surface sup- ported on Al 2 O 3 , FT-IR spectra of CO adsorbed on Pt/Al 2 O 3 , which had been oxidized by pretreatment to be similar to the conditions of the catalytic reaction that was carried out under oxidizing condition, were measured. As shown in Fig. 3, ex- posure of CO to Pt/Al 2 O 3 gave an IR band at around 2100 cm â€“1 due to CO linearly adsorbed on Pt [13â€“17]. However, its band position was slightly different depending on the Al 2 O 3 support. CO species adsorbed on Pt/Al 2 O 3 -A, Pt/Al 2 O 3 -B, and Pt/Al 2 O 3 -D gave a strong IR band at 2104 cm â€“1 , while that on Pt/Al 2 O 3 -C gave the IR band at 2115 cm â€“1 . The interaction between CO and the Pt surface, which is reflected in the wavenumber of the IR band, is strongly dependent on the valence state of the Pt surface [13,16â€“19]. That is, CO bonded on Pt in the metallic state gives rise to an IR band at a lower wavenumber compared with that on Pt in a slightly cationic state. Therefore, the surfaces of Pt supported on Al 2 O 3 -A, Al 2 O 3 -B, and Al 2 O 3 -D were in the metallic state, while that on Al 2 O 3 -C was in the cationic state. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the first three catalysts, Pt/Al 2 O 3 -A, Pt/Al 2 O 3 -B, and Pt/Al 2 O 3 -D, showed higher activities for the total oxidation of HCs than the latter catalyst. This result suggested that Pt in the metallic state supported on Al 2 O 3 is the catalytically active site for the total oxidation of HCs.

Yazawa et al. [11] investigated the valence state of Pt supported on various metal oxides by Pt L II - and L III -edge XANES, and found that Pt on acidic supports was less oxidized than that on basic supports in an oxidizing atmosphere. This indicated that the oxidation-resistance of Pt was enhanced by an increase in the acid strength of the support. On the other hand, Nagai et al. [20] reported that the use of a basic support can stabilize Pt particles in a highly dispersed state. By taking into account these results in the literature [11,20], the differ- ence in the valence state of the Pt surface observed for the Pt/Al 2 O 3 samples in this study was attributed to the difference in the surface acid-base property of the Al 2 O 3 supports. In order to get information on the surface acidity and basicity of the Al 2 O 3 supports, NH 3 -TPD and CO 2 -TPD measurements were carried out. The NH 3 -TPD and CO 2 -TPD profiles of Al 2 O 3 -B and Al 2 O 3 -C were measured because the dispersions of Pt supported on these two Al 2 O 3 were similar (Table 2) while the valence states of the Pt surfaces were different (Fig. 3). Figure 4 shows the NH 3 -TPD profiles of the two Al 2 O 3 sup- ports. The shapes of the NH 3 -TPD profiles were similar, sug- gesting there was no significant difference in the acid strength. The amount of NH 3 desorbed from Al 2 O 3 -C (0.363 mmol/g) was more than that from Al 2 O 3 -B (0.217 mmol/g), indicating that Al 2 O 3 -C has more acid sites. However, as can be seen in Table 2, the surface area of Al 2 O 3 -C was larger than that of Al 2 O 3 -B. Therefore, the amount of acid sites normalized by surface area, which corresponds to the surface density of acid sites, was evaluated. The surface density of acid sites was slightly higher on Al 2 O 3 -B (1.20 u 10 â€“6 mol/m 2 ) than on Al 2 O 3 -C (1.16 u 10 â€“6 mol/m 2 ). A high surface density of acid sites on the Al 2 O 3 support appears to be important for stabi- lizing the Pt surface in the metallic state. Figure 5 shows the CO 2 -TPD profiles of the two Al 2 O 3 supports. Both Al 2 O 3 supports showed similar CO 2 -TPD pro- files, indicating there was no difference in their surface basic property (basic strength and amount of basic site, the amount of CO 2 desorbed from Al 2 O 3 -B and Al 2 O 3 -C were 0.0726 and 0.0768 mmol/g, respectively). The surface density of basic sites was higher on Al 2 O 3 -B (0.40 u 10 â€“6 mol/m 2 ) than on Al 2 O 3 -C (0.24 u 10 â€“6 mol/m 2 ). It is suggested that Pt particles are stabilized in the highly dispersed state on Al 2 O 3 -B under the reaction conditions for the total oxidation of HCs. Although further experimental details are necessary, the surface acidity and basicity of the Al 2 O 3 support can be con- cluded to be an important factor that also determines the ac- tivity of supported Pt for the total oxidation of HCs. 3 Conclusions The activity of supported Pt catalysts for the total oxidation of HCs depended on the metal oxide support. Pt/TiO 2 was the least active catalyst, while Pt/Al 2 O 3 , Pt/ZrO 2 , and Pt/H-ZSM-5 showed similar activities. The activity of the supported Pt catalysts decreased after aging at 750 qC for 50 h in air. Pt/Al 2 O 3 showed the highest activity after aging. The activity of Pt/Al 2 O 3 for the total oxidation of HCs strongly depended on the valence state of the Pt surface.

The surface density of basic sites was higher on Al 2 O 3 -B (0.40 u 10 â€“6 mol/m 2 ) than on Al 2 O 3 -C (0.24 u 10 â€“6 mol/m 2 ). It is suggested that Pt particles are stabilized in the highly dispersed state on Al 2 O 3 -B under the reaction conditions for the total oxidation of HCs. Although further experimental details are necessary, the surface acidity and basicity of the Al 2 O 3 support can be con- cluded to be an important factor that also determines the ac- tivity of supported Pt for the total oxidation of HCs. 3 Conclusions The activity of supported Pt catalysts for the total oxidation of HCs depended on the metal oxide support. Pt/TiO 2 was the least active catalyst, while Pt/Al 2 O 3 , Pt/ZrO 2 , and Pt/H-ZSM-5 showed similar activities. The activity of the supported Pt catalysts decreased after aging at 750 qC for 50 h in air. Pt/Al 2 O 3 showed the highest activity after aging. The activity of Pt/Al 2 O 3 for the total oxidation of HCs strongly depended on the valence state of the Pt surface.

Tel: +81-572-27-9964; Fax: +81-572-27-6812 The catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts for the total oxidation of hydrocarbons was investigated. The activity of supported Pt catalysts (Pt/Al2O3, Pt/ZrO2, Pt/TiO2, and Pt/H-ZSM-5) depends on the metal oxide support. Pt/Al2O3 showed the highest catalytic activity when the catalysts were aged at 750°C for 50 h in air. The activity of Pt/Al2O3 was dependent on the valence state of the Pt surface. Pt/Al2O3 with the Pt surface in the metallic state was more active than with the surface in the cationic state. The surface density of acid and basic sites on the Al2O3 support controlled the valence state of the Pt surface and stability of the Pt particles in the highly dispersed state, respectively. Graphical abstract Pt/Al2O3 that has the Pt surface in the metallic state was more active than with the surface in the cationic state. An Al2O3 support with a high surface density of acid and basic sites is important.
