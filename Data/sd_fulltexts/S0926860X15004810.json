Applied Catalysis A: General, 509 (2016) 30 Well-dispersed Pt on TiO2: A highly active and selective catalyst for hydrogenation of 3-nitroacetophenone Xingchun Yin, Daiping He, Ping Jiang, Gongbing Zhou, Hu Chen, Yan Deng Key Lab of Green Synthesis and Applications, College of Chemistry, Chongqing Normal University, Chongqing 401331, China 100% selectivity to 3-aminoacetophenone could be obtained from 3-nitroacetophenone hydrogenation over the Pt/TiO2. The catalytic activity of the Pt/TiO2 for 3-nitroacetophenone hydrogenation is almost 45 times higher than that of the Rh/SiO2. The results presented here highlight the great potential of the Pt/TiO2 catalyst in the selective hydrogenation of nitroacetophenones on a large scale.

A review on the catalytic combustion of soot in Diesel particulate ï¬� lters for automotive applications: From powder catalysts to structured reactors Debora Fino, Samir Bensaid, Marco Piumetti, Nunzio Russo Department of Applied Science and Technology, Politecnico di Torino, Corso Duca degli Abruzzi 24, 10129 Turin, Italy Soot oxidation catalysts exhibit oxidizing species with high mobility. Soot oxidation catalysts are dynamic entities. Multifunctional traps for diesel particulate abatement are highly complex systems. The multiscale nature of DPFs lends itself to a models hierarchical organization. New modelling approaches are necessary to compute the performance of a DPF.
