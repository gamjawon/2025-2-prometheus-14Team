Graphical abstract The development of efficient catalysts under reducing atmospheres remains a significant challenge. In this study, a series of ZnCuBi catalysts were synthesized by incorporating nitrogen defect sites into a porous carbon–nitrogen network while constructing Zn-N active sites and Cu+/Cu0 active interfaces (ZnCuBi-NvC). Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) modified ZnBiCu-BTC (PVP@ZnBiCu-BTC) served as a precursor, with polyvinylpyrrolidone acting as a nitrogen source during catalyst preparation. The incorporation of Bi enhanced the dispersion of Cu and Zn species. Synergistic catalytic behaviour was demonstrated through experimental characterization and DFT calculations. The Zn-N structure significantly enhanced the adsorption and activation of formaldehyde, while interfacial interactions between copper species promoted acetylene activation. The N-defect structure also facilitated electron transfer, stabilizing the Cu+/Cu0 active interface. The ZnCuBi-NvC catalyst exhibited 95 % selectivity for 1,4-butanediol (BD) in a cyclic activity test under a reducing atmosphere containing acetylene and formaldehyde.

The formaldehyde-acetylene reaction plays a critical role in the production of 1,4-butynediol, a key precursor to 1,4-butanediol (BD). Improving catalyst efficiency and stability in this process is essential for optimizing production yields. Recent research has increasingly focused on enhancing catalysts for formaldehyde ethynylation, aiming to improve both reaction performance and sustainability. Strategies have primarily targeted strengthening Cu-inert support interactions, incorporating oxidizing additives, and exploiting the long-range electromagnetic effects of noble metals to enhance catalytic activity. These approaches aim to optimize metal-support interactions, thereby improving reaction efficiency, selectivity, and sustainability in industrial applications [2–4]. However, the stability of Cu+ species under reducing conditions remains a significant challenge, often leading to diminished catalytic efficiency and selectivity. In reactions such as the formaldehyde-acetylene conversion to 1,4-butynediol, the integrity of Cu+ active sites is crucial, as high selectivity is directly dependent on their stability. Ensuring the stability of these sites is vital for improving catalytic performance and achieving precise reaction outcomes [5]. To address this issue, the present study focuses on the design of a novel zinc-copper-bismuth catalyst. This catalyst is derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and integrates Zn-N sites and nitrogen defects [6–8]. Additionally, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) is commonly employed as a ligand for MOF modification, which facilitates the formation of Zn-N configurations that enhance formaldehyde adsorption as the reaction substrate. Concurrently, the copper active interface reduces the adsorption activation energy of acetylene, thereby effectively promoting reaction progression. The nitrogen defects are anticipated to enable more uniform electron density distribution, consequently improving both catalyst stability and catalytic efficiency. This study provides novel insights for developing advanced catalytic materials capable of maintaining high activity and selectivity under harsh reaction conditions. Defect engineering on catalyst surfaces represents a highly effective strategy for improving catalytic efficiency [9]. The introduction of defects enhances electronic transfer between catalyst components and optimizes reactant adsorption. This strategy not only boosts catalytic activity but also improves selectivity and stability [10–13]. Recently, Yu et al. reported the development of a highly active and stable N-doped Co3O4 catalyst for low-temperature methane oxidation, achieving a methane conversion rate 7.3 times higher than that of pristine Co3O4, with superior performance attributed to the defective structure, enhanced redox properties, and the activation effect of N doping on Co3O4 [14]. Hu et al. presented the synthesis of ultrafine Pd nanoparticles (NPs) on nitrogen-defective graphite-like C3N4 (Pd/DCN), demonstrating superior photocatalytic performance in alkyne transfer hydrogenation with ammonia borane, achieving a higher reaction rate and selectivity compared to Pd/BCN, due to enhanced electronic properties from the Mott–Schottky effect and improved charge separation [15]. Zhang et al. introduced –CRN groups and N vacancies into g-C3N4 (Nv–CRN–CN) for efficient photocatalytic H2O2 production, revealing that dual defect sites enhance light absorption, charge separation, and H2O2 selectivity. The modification achieved an H2O2 production rate of 3093 mmol g-1h−1 and an apparent quantum efficiency of 36.2 % at 400 nm, surpassing previous g-C3N4-based catalysts, offering valuable insights into defect engineering for designing high-performance photocatalysts [16]. The aforementioned studies indicate that the introduction of N defects enhances electronic properties, improves charge separation, activates reactants, and promotes redox processes, significantly boosting catalyst activity and selectivity. Recently, Pei et al. developed MOF-derived Ni@C catalysts with abundant carbon defects, enhancing Ni dispersion and forming electron-deficient Ni nanoparticles, leading to high catalytic activity in the selective hydrogenation of nitrocyclohexane to cyclohexanone oxime. DFT calculations reveal that the SMSI between Ni and defect-rich carbon improves selectivity for cyclohexanone oxime, achieving 97.2 % selectivity at 95.2 % conversion [17]. As demonstrated, MOF-derived materials play a significant role in the preparation of N-defective catalysts due to their unique structural features and tunability. Similarly, MOF-derived metal–carbon composites optimize metal dispersion and reactant adsorption through defect engineering, enhancing catalytic efficiency. Xie et al. demonstrated the fabrication of N vacancies to enhance the electron density of Zn–N4 sites for efficient and stable photocatalytic H2O2 production under simulated sunlight, improving charge separation and transport efficiency, providing insights for designing high-performance photo catalysts for H2O2 photosynthesis [18]. Defect engineering also exerts extensive influence in conventional thermochemical processes. Wang et al. precisely engineered carbon defects in nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts by controlling the removal of N atoms at elevated temperatures, demonstrating that the catalytic activity for acetylene hydrochlorination increases with carbon defect density, which enhances the adsorption and activation of both C2H2 and HCl [19]. Yao et al. constructed a Ni/Al2O3@NC catalyst with 98 % C2H2 conversion and 97 % C2H4 selectivity, where nitrogen-doped carbon defects synergize with controlled NC layer thickness to optimize Ni dispersion, modulate electronic structure, facilitate selective H2 diffusion, and reduce energy barriers through enhanced metal-support interactions and electron transfer [20]. Based on these findings, and in conjunction with our previous work [5], this study develops a zinc-copper-bismuth catalyst derived from MOFs, incorporating Zn-N sites and nitrogen defects, aiming to optimize metal-intermediate interactions, enhance electron density distribution, stabilize the catalyst, and improve catalytic efficiency under harsh conditions. This strategy demonstrates high selectivity for the target product under reducing conditions, emphasizing its potential for practical applications. 2 Results and discussion The PVP@ZnBiCu-BTC composite materials were synthesized with a specific focus on the influence of PVP (Polyvinylpyrrolidone) as a stabilizing agent. SEM characterization of these particles, as seen in Fig. S1, indicates that they adopt a well-defined octahedral shape with a porous surface texture, typical of metal–organic framework (MOF) materials. The impact of PVP loading on the particle morphology is particularly noteworthy. Pure ZnBiCu-BTC particles, without PVP, typically exhibit a larger size of around 1 µm. However, upon the incorporation of 2.66 g of PVP, the particle size significantly reduces to approximately 500 nm. This 50 % decrease is likely due to the ligand’s end-capping effect, which hinders further particle growth and controls their size during the synthesis process [21]. Subsequent calcination of these materials at 400 °C leads to a further reduction in particle size. The SEM images of the MOF-derived catalysts, shown in Fig. S2, confirm that the octahedral structure is preserved even after thermal treatment. However, the calcination process results in a noticeable reduction in particle size, with the final particles measuring around 300 nm. This size reduction may be a consequence of the decomposition of organic ligands and the sintering of metal clusters under high-temperature conditions. HR-TEM images and elemental mapping (Fig. 1 b–d) reveal that Cu and Zn nanoparticles are uniformly embedded in the carbon–nitrogen carrier, with the addition of Bi enhancing the dispersion of both metals. HR-TEM images of ZnCuBi-NvC (Fig. S4a) show lattice spacings of 0.182 nm and 0.251 nm, corresponding to the (111) planes of metallic copper and cuprous oxide (Cu2O), respectively, indicating the formation of a Cu+/Cu0 active interface. For catalysts with varying PVP loadings (Fig. S4b), the Cu2O (111) plane is observed in ZnCuBi-NC, while HR-TEM images of ZnCuBi-C (Fig. S4c) show only the Cu (111) plane. Fig. S5a presents the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the MOF precursor materials. The XRD spectrum of pure Cu-BTC displays its most intense diffraction peak at 11.75°, while for Zn-BTC, the peak is shifted to 10.17°. Upon the incorporation of zinc species into the material, the PVP@Zn-Cu-Bi-BTC sample exhibits a noticeable shift in its characteristic diffraction peak to a lower angle, with the strongest peak now appearing around 11.4°. This shift suggests modifications in the crystalline structure due to the presence of zinc. However, the introduction of the PVP ligand does not appear to affect the overall crystalline phase of the precursor, as there are no significant changes observed in the XRD peaks, indicating that PVP likely does not alter the fundamental crystallinity of the material. Fig. S5b shows the specific surface area (SBET) data for PVP@ZnBiCu-BTC. All tested samples demonstrate a type IV adsorption isotherm, which is characteristic of mesoporous materials [22]. This result confirms the mesoporous nature of PVP@ZnBiCu-BTC. Interestingly, as the PVP loading increases, a gradual decrease in SBET is observed. Specifically, as the PVP content increases from 0 g to 2.66 g, the SBET of PVP@ZnBiCu-BTC values of 459, 476, and 529 m2/g, respectively, as shown in Table S1. This trend suggests that higher PVP concentrations may influence the porosity of the material, possibly by filling pores or altering the material's pore structure. The XRD data presented in Fig. 2 a demonstrates the characteristic diffraction features of the various catalysts under investigation. The main diffraction peaks observed at 36.4° and 42.3° are attributed to the (111) and (220) crystallographic planes of cubic Cu2O nanocrystals, as confirmed by the reference pattern (JCPDS-ICDD 01-078-2076). These peaks signify the presence of Cu2O, a Cu+ phase commonly encountered in catalysts that involve copper. In addition, peaks at 50.4° and 74.1° correspond to the (200) and (220) planes of copper in its metallic state, which adopts a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure (JCPDS-ICDD 01-070-3038) [23]. The clear distinction between Cu2O and Cu in these patterns indicates the presence of both phases in the catalyst material, and the formation of a Cu+/Cu0 active interface, which is consistent with the HR-TEM characterization results [24,25]. The XRD spectrum further reveals the presence of zinc oxide, with characteristic peaks at 31.8°, 34.4°, 47.5°, 56.6°, 62.9°, and 69.1°, corresponding to the (100), (002), (102), (110), (103), and (201) planes of ZnO (PDF#98-000-0483) [26,27]. These peaks confirm the incorporation of ZnO into the catalyst, which is consistent with its anticipated role in catalytic reactions. Despite the clear presence of Cu2O, Cu, and ZnO, no distinct diffraction peak corresponding to the Bi element is observed in the XRD pattern. This absence can be attributed to the low concentration of Bi and its high dispersion within the catalyst structure. Fig. 2b presents the full X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of the catalysts, revealing notable differences in the XPS profiles among the various catalyst samples. Fig. 2c further demonstrates the Zn 2p XPS analysis, showing a significant shift in the Zn peaks upon the introduction of ligands. Compared to ZnCuBi-C without ligands, the Zn XPS characteristic peak for ZnCuBi-NvC shifts 0.5 eV to the right, while the ZnCuBi-NC catalyst exhibits a 0.8 eV shift to the right. This suggests an increase in the electron cloud density of Zn [28,29]. This phenomenon likely results from modifications to the local coordination environment around Zn caused by ligand incorporation. Specifically, the introduction of nitrogen facilitates the accumulation of electron density around the Zn species, thereby enhancing its electron cloud density and lowering its oxidation state. Fig. 2d illustrates the deconvolution of the C 1s XPS characteristic peaks for the catalysts. In both ZnCuBi-NvC and ZnCuBi-NC catalysts, the peaks at 287.1 eV and 288.6 eV correspond to C=N and C-N bonds, respectively. In contrast, the ZnCuBi-C catalyst shows a peak at 288.9 eV attributed to C=O bonds and a peak at 281.9 eV corresponding to C-M metal–carbon bonds. These results suggest that Cu and Zn in ZnCuBi-C predominantly exist in the form of C-M or M−M bonds. Fig. 2e and f provide a further comparison of the N 1s XPS deconvolution results for the ZnCuBi-NvC and ZnCuBi-NC catalysts. The analysis reveals that both catalysts contain M−N metal-nitrogen coordination, attributed to Zn-N coordination, with the pyrrolic nitrogen peak at 399.2 eV showing minimal change [30]. The introduction of nitrogen defects induces the partial transformation of pyridinic N (397.6 eV) in ZnCuBi-NC into oxidized N species (403.3 eV) in ZnCuBi-NvC, as evidenced by XPS peak deconvolution. However, the peaks corresponding to pyridinic nitrogen, graphite nitrogen, and metal-nitrogen bonds shift slightly to the left, indicating a reduction in the electron cloud density around the nitrogen coordination sites [31]. This suggests that nitrogen acts as an electron-donating group, transferring electrons to the metal, which lowers the electron cloud density of the nitrogen species. This is consistent with the Zn 2p analysis. Fig. 2g presents the Raman spectra, which display two distinct peaks at 1350 cm−1 and 1580 cm−1, corresponding to the typical D and G bands of carbon, respectively. The G band reflects the disorder within the carbon structure, while the D band signifies the graphitic nature of the NxC matrix. The Raman peak at 2890 cm−1 is attributed to the highly graphitized 2D peak of the carbon support. The ID/IG ratios for ZnCuBi-C, ZnCuBi-NvC, and ZnCuBi-NC are 1.15, 0.96, and 0.95, respectively, suggesting that the carbon in ZnCuBi-C exhibits the highest degree of disorder, likely resulting from the absence of ligands, which promotes the formation of a disordered carbon structure upon pyrolysis. The I2D/IG ratios for ZnCuBi-NvC and ZnCuBi-NC are 1.07 and 1.54, respectively, indicating a significant presence of highly ordered graphitic carbon structure in ZnCuBi-NC [32]. In contrast, the degree of order in ZnCuBi-NvC is lower, likely due to insufficient ligand content, which leads to the formation of nitrogen vacancy defects during pyrolysis. This further corroborates the electron transfer observed in the N 1s XPS of ZnCuBi-NvC. Additionally, the defect sites in the as-prepared samples were identified using EPR spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 2h, the ZnCuBi-C catalyst exhibits almost no EPR signal around g = 2.004, whereas a weak EPR signal is observed in ZnCuBi-NC. Upon the introduction of nitrogen elements, ZnCuBi-NvC displays a significantly higher EPR signal. Since this sample was annealed in an inert atmosphere, it is speculated that ZnCuBi-NvC contains a substantial number of N vacancies [33]. The EPR intensity of ZnCuBi-NC is considerably lower than that of ZnCuBi-NvC, likely due to the increase in ligands, which leads to the formation of highly graphitized carbon–nitrogen supports. This effect likely compensates for the nitrogen vacancy defects in the catalyst, strengthens the C-N bonding, and reduces the number of unpaired electrons. These observations are consistent with the Raman spectroscopic results. Fig. 2i displays the FT-IR spectrum analysis of the catalysts. The characteristic peaks near 1400 cm−1 and 1600 cm−1 are attributed to the interactions of C-N bonds. Compared to ZnCuBi-NC, the C-N bond interactions in ZnCuBi-NvC are weaker. Additionally, in the ZnCuBi-NvC catalyst, the vibration peak at 895 cm−1, corresponding to the M−N metal-nitrogen bond, shows a redshift, indicating differences in the micro-coordination environment of nitrogen in the two catalysts. This further supports the presence of N vacancy defects, which agrees with the Raman and EPR characterization results. As displayed in Fig. 3 a, the catalytic performance of different catalysts was evaluated under Same condition (t = 20 h, T = 90 °C, n (C2H2) = 11.5 mmol, and V (3.0 wt% CH2O) = 20 mL), the experiments were conducted in a 50-mL batch reactor.As observed, the BD selectivity of ZnCuBi-C was 82.1 %, formaldehyde conversion rate of 34.1 %. The low formaldehyde conversion rate of the catalyst may be due to the lack of Zn-N structure, while the diminished BD selectivity is likely caused by excessive Cu0 formation. An overabundance of Cu0 promotes acetylene polymerization, leading to carbon deposition that not only consumes reactant acetylene but also hinders the reaction process. Notably, among the tested catalysts, ZnCuBi-NvC demonstrated the optimal catalytic performance (X (CH2O) = 69.8 %, S (BD) = 95.5 %). The high selectivity of the products can be attributed to the formation of a Cu+/Cu0 active interface and Zn-N site, the activity of the ZnCuBi-NC catalyst decreased, and the BD selectivity was 86.9 %. Combined with the XPS results (Fig. 3b) and TEM analysis (Fig. S4), we found that the predominance of Cu+ species in this catalyst impedes the formation of active Cu+/Cu0 interfaces, consequently decreasing catalytic activity. Fig. 3b clearly illustrate the Cu2p XPS peak of the MOF-derived catalyst showed a Cu+/Cu0 characteristic peak of 932.8 eV and a Cu2+ characteristic peak of 933.9 eV. A satellite peak of Cu2+ appeared at 942.1 eV in the ZnCuBi-NC catalyst, indicating that Cu2+ species were dominant in the catalyst [34–36]. Fig. S6 further analyzes the ratio of Cu+/Cu0 in different catalysts using Cu LMM. The Cu0/Cu+ ratio of ZnCuBi-C catalyst was 1.6, and the ratio of Cu+/Cu0 gradually increased with the introduction of precursor PVP, among which the Cu+/Cu0 ratios of ZnCuBi-NvC and ZnCuBi-NC catalysts were 2.2 and 4.0, respectively [37]. This is consistent with the results of TEM. To investigate the underlying reasons for the differences in catalytic activity, Fig. 3c–d present the infrared (IR) and chemical adsorption–desorption (TPD) characterization data for various catalysts after acetylene adsorption, revealing notable differences in their behaviour. In Fig. 3c, the catalysts exhibit transmission peaks at 584.5 cm−1 and 3437.6 cm−1, corresponding to the bending vibration of C≡C and the stretching vibration of C≡C-H in acetylene, respectively. A weak characteristic peak at 1637.8 cm−1, attributed to the C–H bond deformation vibration of acetylene, reflects the interaction between the acetylene molecule and the catalyst surface. Compared to ZnCuBi-C, the ZnCuBi-NC and ZnCuBi-NvC catalysts show stronger infrared absorption peaks, likely due to the formation of the Cu+/Cu0 active interface, which enhances the adsorption of acetylene molecules. Fig. 3d displays the acetylene desorption behaviour of the different catalysts, with the ZnCuBi-NvC catalyst showing a desorption peak at approximately 500 °C. ZnCuBi-NC exhibits desorption peaks at both 200 °C and 500 °C, indicating that some acetylene is physically adsorbed. In contrast, ZnCuBi-C shows a single desorption peak at 200 °C, suggesting that most acetylene molecules are bound to the catalyst surface via physical adsorption. These results further confirm the superior performance of the Cu+/Cu0 active interface in facilitating acetylene adsorption. Fig. S7 presents the infrared spectra of the catalyst after formaldehyde adsorption. The characteristic peaks at 667.8 cm−1 and 1725.9 cm−1 correspond to the flexural and stretching vibrations of the formaldehyde C=O bond, respectively, indicating that formaldehyde may interact with the catalyst surface during adsorption. Furthermore, the C–H deformation peak at 1109.3 cm−1 reflects the interaction between formaldehyde and the metal or metal oxide catalyst surface. Compared to ZnCuBi-C, the ZnCuBi-NC and ZnCuBi-NvC catalysts exhibit stronger formaldehyde adsorption peaks, likely due to the formation of Zn-N bonds, which enhance formaldehyde adsorption. In contrast, ZnCuBi-C lacks Zn-N coordination, which weakens its formaldehyde adsorption and results in a significant decrease in formaldehyde conversion. These findings highlight the structural differences in catalyst performance during the adsorption of reaction substrates. To further validate these experimental results, Fig. 3e–f present density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the adsorption energy for acetylene and formaldehyde on different catalysts. The results show that the adsorption energy barrier for acetylene at the Cu+/Cu0 interface is −1.45 eV, while the barrier for formaldehyde at the Zn-N interface is −1.79 eV, significantly lower than that of other structures (Fig. S9). These findings are consistent with experimental data and further emphasize the crucial role of Cu+/Cu0 and Zn-N structures in catalysis. As shown in Fig. 4 a, the catalytic activity of the optimal ZnCuBi-NvC catalyst in the acetylene-formaldehyde reaction was evaluated over five cycles (t = 20 h, T = 90 °C, n (C2H2) = 11.5 mmol, V (3.0 wt% CH2O) = 20 mL, m (catalyst) = 300 mg). Over these cycles, the catalyst's activity remained stable, with the formaldehyde conversion rate maintaining a steady value of approximately 66 %, while the selectivity for BD remained above 94 %, demonstrating excellent stability. The catalyst's stability may be attributed to the valence stability of the active species. The presence of N defects promotes metal-to-metal interactions and electron transfer, thus enhancing the stability of the active copper species. Fig. 4b presents the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of ZnCuBi-NvC after five cycles, where the main active metal phases remained unchanged. The characteristic diffraction peaks of Cu (200) and (220) planes at 50.4° and 74.1° (PDF#01-070-3038), as well as those of Cu2O (111) and (220) planes at 36.4° and 42.3°, were retained, alongside some Zn phases. No significant shift in the Zn 2p XPS profile was observed, indicating that the N-coordination environment of Zn remained stable (Fig. S10). Fig. 4c displays the Cu 2p XPS spectrum after cycling, showing characteristic peaks for Cu+/Cu0 at 932.8 eV and Cu2+ at 933.9 eV, with no significant change in the valence state of the active copper. To further investigate the stability of the active copper species, Fig. S10 shows the Cu LMM profile, revealing that the Cu+/Cu0 ratios of the ZnCuBi-NvC-x catalyst were 2.2, 2.3, and 2.5 after the 1st, 3rd, and 5th cycles, respectively, compared to a ratio of 2.2 before the initial reaction. These results demonstrate that the ZnCuBi-NvC catalyst can maintain the steady-state composition of its active copper throughout multiple cycles, with only slight changes in the Cu+/Cu0 ratio, further confirming its excellent stability in catalytic reactions. These findings provide strong evidence supporting the long-term use of the ZnCuBi-NvC catalyst and highlight its robust resistance to reactivity changes. Fig. 4d shows the N 1 s XPS spectra of the ZnCuBi-NvC catalyst before and after five cycles. The data indicate a 0.3 eV shift to the left in the M−N peak, accompanied by a decrease in electron cloud density. The pyrrole nitrogen peak at 399.2 eV shifted to the right by approximately 0.6 eV after cycling, with an associated increase in electron cloud density. This change strongly suggests that N defects can modulate the electron cloud density between metals, thereby stabilizing the valence state of the active metal. Fig. 4e illustrates the three-dimensional charge density difference between the Cu+/Cu0 interface and the CNv support, where yellow and cyan regions represent charge accumulation and depletion, respectively. The figure reveals that the average planar charge density difference at the Cu+/Cu0 interface is negative, while it is positive on the CNv side, indicating that electrons are transferred from the CNv material to the Cu+/Cu0 interface under the influence of the interfacial electric field [38,39]. According to Bader charge analysis, approximately 1.792 electrons are transferred from CNv to the Cu+/Cu0 interface, further demonstrating that N defects enhance the interaction between the metal and the support, contributing to the stability of the Cu+/Cu0 interface [40]. This result is consistent with experimental data and underscores the significant role of N defects in improving catalyst performance, particularly in strengthening the interaction between the metal and its support. 3 Conclusion This study successfully synthesized a novel catalyst based on a carbon–nitrogen (C–N) support, incorporating Cu–Zn–Bi and enriched with nitrogen defects. Nitrogen-defective sites were introduced into a porous C–N framework, which also contained Zn–N sites and Cu+/Cu0 active interfaces, resulting in the formation of the ZnCuBi-NvC catalyst. PVP-modified ZnBiCu-BTC (PVP@ZnBiCu-BTC) was used as the precursor, with PVP serving as the nitrogen source during catalyst preparation. The incorporation of bismuth was essential for improving the dispersion of Cu and Zn species, thereby enhancing the overall catalytic performance. Experimental characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed the synergistic catalytic behaviour of the catalyst. Notably, the Zn-N structure played a pivotal role in promoting the adsorption and activation of formaldehyde, while interfacial interactions between copper species facilitated the activation of acetylene. The nitrogen-defective structure further promoted efficient electron transfer, thus stabilizing the Cu+/Cu0 active interface. Activity tests revealed that the ZnCuBi-NvC catalyst achieved a formaldehyde conversion rate of 69.8 % and a high selectivity of 95.5 % for BD in the acetylene-formaldehyde reaction. Furthermore, the catalyst maintained 95 % selectivity for BD in cyclic activity tests conducted under a reducing atmosphere containing both acetylene and formaldehyde. Thus, this study presents a novel strategy that enhances the stability of active metals while achieving highly active catalytic performance under reducing conditions.

        "dc:description": "The development of efficient catalysts under reducing atmospheres remains a significant challenge. In this study, a series of ZnCuBi catalysts were synthesized by incorporating nitrogen defect sites into a porous carbon–nitrogen network while constructing Zn-N active sites and Cu+/Cu0 active interfaces (ZnCuBi-NvC). Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) modified ZnBiCu-BTC (PVP@ZnBiCu-BTC) served as a precursor, with polyvinylpyrrolidone acting as a nitrogen source during catalyst preparation. The incorporation of Bi enhanced the dispersion of Cu and Zn species. Synergistic catalytic behaviour was demonstrated through experimental characterization and DFT calculations. The Zn-N structure significantly enhanced the adsorption and activation of formaldehyde, while interfacial interactions between copper species promoted acetylene activation. The N-defect structure also facilitated electron transfer, stabilizing the Cu+/Cu0 active interface. The ZnCuBi-NvC catalyst exhibited 95 % selectivity for 1,4-butanediol (BD) in a cyclic activity test under a reducing atmosphere containing acetylene and formaldehyde.",
