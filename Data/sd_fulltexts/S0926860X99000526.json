The cobalt was either added during preparation or impregnated on the dry VPO precursor. The catalytic evaluation showed that the cobalt-impregnated solids gave the highest yields to maleic anhydride. To understand the promoting effect of cobalt, the catalysts were characterized using XRD, FTIR, SEM, TPR, Raman spectroscopy and XPS. The solids obtained through the addition of Co during the synthesis of the VPO precursor exhibit less disordered crystalline phases in the (001) direction. No separate Co-containing phase could be detected through the techniques used. In the non-equilibrated catalysts, V(V)-containing phases were detected through Raman spectroscopy. After 500h on stream under reaction conditions (equilibrated catalysts), vanadyl pyrophosphate was the only crystalline phase detected while V(IV) was the only surface species observed using XPS. XRD, FTIR and SEM coincidentally show that depending on the way cobalt is added the solids obtained develop different structural features. Keywords n-Butane oxidation Maleic anhydride VPO Promoters Cobalt 1 Introduction Alkanes are a very attractive feedstock to produce highly valued chemicals due to their low price and environmental neutrality. So far, however, the only successful industrial process is the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride using vanadium–phosphorus oxides (VPO) [1]. The origin of this unique ability of the VPO system to produce this deep oxidation has been a matter of intense research for the last 20 years [1–12]. It is generally agreed upon that the best catalyst precursor is VOHPO4·0.5H2O which is converted to (VO)2P2O7 during activation. The situation changes when a closer look is given to the system. Through the use of more sophisticated techniques applied to in situ studies such as NMR, Raman spectroscopy and XRD, the presence of V(V)-containing phases has been detected in laboratory catalysts. Among them, αII, γ, δ, and other VOPO4 phases have been claimed as necessary for the catalytic act [4, 5, 13]. However, these phases have never been detected in the so-called equilibrated catalysts that have been on stream for over several hundred hours [7, 14, 15]. Maybe, as suggested by several authors, the V(IV)/V(V) couple is formed on the (VO)2P2O7 surface of the highly crystalline equilibrated catalysts [8, 14, 15]. All the industrial catalysts contain additional cations that act as promoters of different kinds. A wide spectrum of cations such as Ce, Cd, Ni, Zn, Bi, Cu, Li, V, Zr, Mg, Ti, La, Mo, Nb, B, Fe and Cr have been mainly reported in patents [12]although a few articles have been published in the open literature. Bej and Rao [16]studied the simultaneous addition of Mo and Ce and reported good yields under severe operating conditions. Zazhigalov et al. [17, 18]studied alkaline and alkaline earth additives. Their goal was to achieve a fine control of the acid–base properties of the surface. The rationale was that basic sites participate in butane activation while the overall acidic character contributes to the rapid desorption of the product. Their catalysts, however, do not show a significant improvement in performance. Cheng [19]modified the P/V ratio and added both in and TEOS (tetraethylorthosilicate) to the VPO formulations. He concluded that the promoters drastically decrease both the thickness of platelets in the layered morphology, and their crystallite sizes. Sananes et al. [20]noticed that the addition of either Zn, Zr or Ti increased the molar yield to maleic anhydride in non-equilibrated catalysts. They were unable to explain this effect with the support of characterization data. In a systematic study of roughly a dozen promoters Hutchings and Higgins [21]used a simple kinetic analysis to gauge their effect upon the catalytic performance. The main conclusion they reached was that only Mo and Co showed a promotional effect, increasing the product yield per unit surface area. The authors reported that these cations have an electronic effect that induces the fast desorption of maleic anhydride limiting its over-oxidation and suggested that Co and Mo may induce defect formation in the active phase. Thus, even at low n-butane concentrations, the solids maintain an optimal defect concentration thereby controlling the oxidation state of vanadium on the surface. Several papers make specific reference to the effect and role of cobalt used as a promoter that can be summarized as follows: 1. Hutchings et al. [22]and Zazhigalov et al. [23]proposed the formation of cobalt phosphate. Its role would be to limit the phosphorus loss during reaction. 2. Hutchings et al. [22]and Volta and co-workers [24, 25]concluded that the addition of cobalt increases the V(V)/V(IV) ratio in VPO catalysts depending on the preparation method. The latter also reported that the promoter increases the rate of catalyst equilibration. 3. Zazhigalov et al. [23]reported that the addition of cobalt induces an increase in the P/V surface ratio. 4. Takita et al. [26]observed a linear relationship between catalytic activity for maleic anhydride formation and the frequency of the VO vibration of solids containing different promoters (Mn, Co, Fe, Zn and Zr). They concluded that the additives were incorporated into the crystal lattice of (VO)2P2O7. This study is aimed at providing additional experimental evidence concerning the role of Co incorporated to equilibrated VPO catalysts. In this way, we hope to contribute to the elucidation of the discrepancies described above. A battery of techniques, XRD, IR, Raman and XPS spectroscopies, together with temperature-programmed reduction and plug-flow reaction measurements were combined in these studies. 2 Experimental 2.1 Precursor synthesis Five grams of V2O5 were reduced with 30ml of isobutanol and 20ml of benzyl alcohol under reflux for 3h. Orthophosphoric acid (100%) was then added to obtain the desired P/V ratio in the solid and the solution refluxed for 2h. The suspension obtained was filtered and the solid dried at 390K in air for 24h. The cobalt (as cobalt acetate) was incorporated by: (i) Addition during the reduction step. The nomenclature is VPCoxR (where x represents wt% of Co). (ii) Addition during phosphatization. VPCoxP. (iii) By precursor impregnation, VPCoxI. The impregnation solutions contained the required amount of cobalt acetate in 30ml of isobutanol. After impregnation the solvent was evaporated at 310K, and the wet solid dried at 390K in air. The final Co content of all of the preparations was determined by atomic absorption. 2.2 Catalyst activation and reaction A fixed-bed reactor containing 1.0g of precursor with particle size in the 170–250μm range (Tyler 60–80 mesh) was used to activate the solids and perform the catalytic tests. All products were analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph equipped with a FID detector and an AT-1200 column. The catalysts were activated in two steps: 1. The precursor was heated up to 603K while flowing a mixture of 0.75% n-butane–air, with a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) measured at STP of 900h−1. The temperature was kept constant at 603K for 3h. Those catalysts which only underwent this treatment are here called non-equilibrated catalysts. 2. The n-butane concentration was increased to 1.5% while still maintaining the GHSV at 900h−1. The temperature was raised until either 80% conversion or the maximum allowable temperature of 703K was reached. Then, the GHSV was raised to 2500h−1 and the temperature was slowly increased with the limitation that conversion never exceeded 80%. The catalytic data reported here were measured over solids that did not show any change in activity and selectivity after at least 500h on stream (equilibrated catalysts). At this point when the reaction temperature was randomly varied up and down, reproducible values of activities and selectivities were obtained (error ≤5%). 2.3 Catalyst characterization 2.3.1 X-ray diffraction The measurements were made with a Shimadzu XD-D1-ray diffractometer, using Nickel-filtered Cu K α radiation with a scanning rate of 1°min−1. 2.3.2 Infrared spectroscopy The IR spectra were obtained at room temperature using a Shimadzu FTIR-8101M spectrometer. The solid samples were prepared in the form of pressed wafers (ca. 2wt% sample in KBr). 2.3.3 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) The morphology was studied using a Jeol microscope (Model JSM-35C) operated at accelerating voltages of 20–25kV. The particles were glued to a metallic sample holder using silverpaint. The preparations were covered with a thin gold layer. 2.3.4 Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) An Ohkura TP-20022S instrument equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used for the TPR experiments. 100mg samples were used and the reducing gas was a 5% H2–Ar stream, with a heating rate of 10K/min up to 1023K. 2.3.5 Laser Raman spectroscopy (LRS) The Raman spectra were recorded with a Jasco Laser Raman spectrometer model TRS-600-SZ-P, equipped with a CCD (charge coupled device) with the detector cooled to about 153K using liquid N2. The excitation source was the 514.5nm line of a Spectra 9000 Photometrics Ar ion Laser. The Laser power was set at 30mw. All the spectra were recorded with the samples under ambient conditions. The powdered solid was pressed into a thin wafer about 1mm thick. 2.3.6 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy The XPS measurements were carried out using an ESCA750 Shimadzu electron spectrometer. Non-monochromatic Mg K α X-ray radiation was used. The anode was operated at 8kV and 30mA and the pressure in the analysis chamber was about 2×10−6 Pa. The data were collected using an ESCAPAC 760 computer interfaced to the spectrometer and analyzed with the Googly software, developed at the University of Pittsburgh. The binding energies (BE) were referred to the C 1s signal (284.6eV). Peak synthesis was made using Gaussian–Lorentzian components. Account has been taken of the presence of Kα3 and Kα4 spectral lines of the large O 1s signal. These satellite peaks are 8.4 and 10.2eV down-shifted from the O 1s main peak and overlap the V 2p1/2 signal. Since the resolution of the V 2p1/2 is poorer than that of the V 2p3/2 level due to the overlapping of four signals, we preferably used the latter BEs and widths for comparison with literature data. Additional data for the curve fitting of the V 2p doublets include: 1. Spin-orbit separation 7.2eV. 2. V 2p1/2/V 2p3/2 intensity ratio 0.5. 3 Results 3.1 n-Butane oxidation Fig. 1 shows the catalytic performance of equilibrated solids containing Co added in different forms and a blank VPO formulation. The VPCo4I and 6I catalysts are the most active ones. The equilibrated cobalt-containing catalysts have 42m2/g while the equilibrated blank VPO has a somewhat lower surface area of 36m2/g. This 20% increase in surface area is upon the Co addition expected after the data published by Hutchings and Higgins [21]. The selectivity profiles are quite different in the four catalysts studied. Both the unpromoted VPO catalyst and the VPCo4P show increased selectivity with higher temperature. At the highest temperatures explored, the VPO selectivity starts to fall maybe as a consequence of the over-oxidation of the product. For the other three catalysts the selectivity monotonically decreases with reaction temperature. This seems directly related to the significantly higher activity of these formulations. Stronger oxidation catalysts will increasingly favor total oxidation at increased temperatures. Note that in all cases the maleic anhydride yield increases with temperature. The selectivity dependence with temperature is similar to that observed by Albonetti et al. [27]when they compared non-equilibrated and equilibrated unpromoted catalysts. The equilibrated catalyst exhibited an initially higher selectivity, which decreases as the n-butane conversion increases. The high selectivity (extrapolated to zero conversion) suggests that at low temperature the surface sites are highly selective to maleic anhydride formation, and at high conversion, the formation of CO x is preferred. When the non-equilibrated catalysts were assayed, highly scattered results dependent on time-on-stream were obtained. No correlation between catalytic behavior and promoter addition could be detected. 3.2 Bulk structure of the precursors and catalysts studied The XRD patterns of the precursors only show the characteristic reflections of hemihydrated vanadyl hydrogen phosphate. However, the solid obtained by the addition of Co during the reduction step also shows low intensity reflections belonging to VO(H2PO4)2. No catalytic data were obtained on this solid because it was not possible to produce the pure precursor phase (VOHPO4·0.5H2O) using this procedure. Table 1 shows the FWHMs of the (001) and (130) plane reflections, together with the ratio of their peak height (relative intensities). Note that I 001/I 130 is around 0.4±0.1 with the only exception of VPCo1R (1.2). The width of the (001) reflections is smaller for those solids in which Co was added during synthesis. In Table 2 Table 3 , the XRD data for non-equilibrated and equilibrated catalysts are shown. In all cases the only phase detected was vanadyl pyrophosphate. The main peaks correspond to the (200) and (042) reflections. Again the FWHMs of these peaks and their height ratios are reported. Note that the FWHMs of the equilibrated solids are smaller than in the non-equilibrated ones while the stacking order reflected by I 200/I 042 remained unchanged. Fig. 2 shows the IR spectra of two solids containing 4% of Co. In one case Co was impregnated while in the other it was added during the precursor synthesis. Both of them agree with the spectrum recorded with unpromoted VPO. A more detailed observation of the spectra, though, shows that the 742cm−1 band corresponding to the P–O–P vibration is more intense in the VPCo4P. This is more clearly seen when the I 1241/ I 742 relative intensities reported in Tables 2 and 3 are compared. The 1241cm−1 band is assigned to νasPO3. The solids obtained upon the addition of Co together with the phosphoric acid show a lower value independent of the Co content and of the time-on-stream. This suggests that this method of Co addition increases the number of P–O–P layer linkages. To investigate the possible presence of other phases Raman spectroscopy was used. This technique is more sensitive than XRD to detect the possible formation of V(V) phases that might be present in the VPO system. Fig. 3 shows the enlarged Raman spectra of several equilibrated and non-equilibrated solids. None of the equilibrated catalysts contain VOPO4 phases. A typical spectrum is shown (VPCo6I) which exhibits the bands of the (VO)2P2O7 at 927, 1191 and 1140cm−1, in agreement with those reported by Guliants et al. [28]. Additional bands appear at 1090 and 990cm−1 in VPCo1I and at 1020cm−1 in VPCo2P. These bands indicate that the δ- and αI-VOPO4 phases are present in these non-equilibrated solids. The other non-equilibrated solids do not show any signal belonging to V(V) phases. In our quest to find different types of cobalt interactions and/or phases in the different VPO solids prepared, they were subjected to TPR. The TPR profiles of equilibrated and non-equilibrated solids are shown in Fig. 4 . The TPR trace of non-equilibrated VPCo4I shows a wide peak centered at 574K. This is a characteristic peak exhibited by cobalt oxides [29]. The hydrogen consumption accounts for only 40% of the cobalt present in the sample. The TPR profile of the equilibrated catalysts is absolutely different showing in all cases peaks at much higher temperatures (ca. 1000K), symptomatic of the presence of less reducible Co-containing species. The morphology of equilibrated VPO, VPCo4I and VPCo4P catalysts was studied by SEM (Fig. 5 ). These catalysts are characterized by a lamellar morphology with well-developed plate-like crystals. The unpromoted sample (P/V=1.26) shows a small platelet morphology which is improved in the Co-impregnated solid. The VPCo4P reveals a larger, thicker exposed platelet face than the other two. 3.3 The surface of Co added VPO Fig. 6 shows the evolution of (Co/V)s as determined by XPS when the Co bulk content increases in the Co-impregnated solids. Both non-equilibrated and equilibrated catalysts show linear correlationships between (Co/V)s and the bulk concentration of Co. In the equilibrated catalysts a higher scattering is clearly observed (Table 3). The precursor (P/V)s data shown in Table 1 indicates that the Co addition leads to phosphorus surface enrichment, in agreement with previous results [23]. This effect is, however, less significant in both non-equilibrated and equilibrated catalysts (Tables 2 and 3). The oxidation states of vanadium on the surface of VPO catalysts has been a highly controversial matter for the last few years (vide ultra). The results obtained through curve fitting of the spectra in the V 2p–O 1s region are summarized in Table 4 , while a representative spectrum is shown in Fig. 7 . In all the cases studied, the curve fitting leads to a single, well-defined binding energy for V 2p3/2 (517.7±0.1ev) assigned to V(IV) in agreement with the values reported by López Granados et al. [15]for unpromoted catalysts. An additional method to find out the vanadium oxidation state is based on the difference in the BEs of the O 1s and V 2p3/2 signals (Δ(O 1s–V 2p3/2)). This method avoids the use of a reference as we concluded in a previous study [14]. Table 4 shows that all the equilibrated catalysts give Δ values of 14.3±0.1eV. Coulston et al. [30]have reported a correlationship between the Δ value and the average vanadium oxidation state. These values are reported in the last column of Table 4 for comparison with the results obtained from curve fitting. These calculated values are all around 4. This approach also supports the overwhelming presence of V(IV) on the surface of the VPO equilibrated catalysts. 4 Discussion The catalytic data (Fig. 1) show that the VPO solids impregnated with 4–6% of Co by weight and VPCo2P exhibit the best maleic anhydride yields. This is due to a significant increase in activity while the selectivity is less affected. There seems to be an optimum in the amount added during the VPO synthesis. Note that these conclusions do apply to equilibrated catalysts. It would be desirable to compare the catalytic results with others reported in the literature. Unfortunately, this is almost impossible because there are no such data reported for equilibrated Co-promoted catalysts. In some cases, the activity/selectivity data have been obtained on non-equilibrated powders [22, 25, 26], and in another case using pellets [23]. Let us now analyze the results obtained through the use of a variety of characterization tools and how they help us understand the promoting effect of cobalt. The XRD patterns of the precursor indicate a high degree of disorder in the VOHPO4·0.5H2O structure that may be traced to the high P/V ratio. Guliants et al. [28]have reported that at increasing P/V ratios the disorder of the precursor lattice increases, a feature that is carried through to the pyrophosphate catalyst. No VO(H2PO4)2 was detected despite the high P/V ratio (1.26), except in the precursor obtained with Co added in the reduction step. The presence of metaphosphate in the activated solid is symptomatic of the presence of VO(H2PO4)2 in the precursor. Guliants et al. [28]have reported that the catalysts prepared with the same organic synthesis route and similar P/V ratio have a content of metaphosphate phases of less than 2% based on the 31 PMAS-NMR data. Fast, standard activations of these precursors resulted in the formation of vanadyl pyrophosphate with no other crystalline phase detected by XRD. Several authors [1, 28, 31]agree that two parameters are used to determine the crystal size and degree of structural (stacking fault) disorder of vanadyl pyrophosphate: the half width of the (200) peak, and the ratio of intensities of the (200) and (042) reflections. These reflections are related to the (001) and (130) planes in the hemihydrate precursor. The line width increases with the decreasing size of the crystallites. The degree of disorder may also be increasing the line width. The decrease in the FWHMs of the (200) reflection with a long time on stream indicates that the thickness of the particles in the (100) direction decreases. The half width of the (042) peak changes slightly, reflecting a constant crystalline order of the bc plane, as well. The infrared spectra shown in Fig. 2 confirm that in equilibrated catalysts the only phase detected is vanadyl pyrophosphate. This compound presents a structure [3]in which two VO6 octahedra are joined by their edges. Octahedral pairs are connected by PO4 tetrahedra yielding a layer structure in the (200) plane. The layers are connected through V–OV and P–O–P bonds resulting in chains of vanadium octahedra sharing opposite corners and pyrophosphate groups. The following IR band assignments have been made [31, 32]ν(P–O–P)=742cm−1, ν(V–O–V)=797cm−1, ν(VO)=968cm−1. The bands at 1064, 1132, and 1245cm−1 are assigned to ν(PO3). On these peaks additional shoulders are observed (Fig. 2). The ν(P–O–P) at 742cm−1 has a lower relative intensity in the impregnated catalysts. This is substantiated by the high values (∼15) of the 1245/742cm−1 intensity ratio (last column of Table 2). The different preparation methods produce solids with varying strengths in the layer linkages. Perhaps, this is a consequence of the intercalation of excess lattice oxygen between the layers. In this vein, Satsuma et al. [33]reported a decrease in the intensity of the VO–V vibration due to the disruption of the interlayer caused by the intercalation of excess lattice oxygen. The weakening of the VO–V band correlated well with the broadening of the (200) line in the XRD pattern. The average SEM measured platelet thickness was 90 and 50nm for equilibrated VPCo4P and VPCo4I, respectively (Fig. 5). These dimensions are about 10 times larger than those calculated from XRD. FTIR spectra show varying strengths in the layer linkage of promoted catalysts. Maybe in the end the observed discrepancy is due to the combination of two factors, the stacking of several crystallite layers and the extent of disorder of each crystal. On the other hand, no shifts in the VO wave number of the promoted catalysts were observed. Takita et al. [26]found a significant shift in the absorption bands of the catalysts containing promoters. They suggested that the promoter ions are located in the crystal lattice of vanadyl pyrophosphate. Although both XRD and FTIR data indicate that the only phase present in some non-equilibrated catalysts is (VO)2P2O7, several authors have reported the presence of other phases in very low proportions [21, 28]. Laser Raman spectroscopy is recognized as a very sensitive technique for this purpose. As a matter of fact the Raman spectra of certain non-equilibrated catalysts show the presence of low amounts of orthophosphate (Fig. 3). The bands at 990 and 1090cm−1 belong to the main signals of αII-VOPO4 while the 1020cm−1 band might indicate the presence of the X1 phase reported by Koyano et al. [9]. However, the same precursors maintained on stream for more than 400h produce solids containing vanadyl pyrophosphate only, according to the Raman spectra shown in Fig. 3. These findings coincide with the observations made by López Granados et al. [15]with unpromoted VPO preparations. They found that the non-equilibrated catalysts contained small amounts of γ-VOPO4 which disappeared after equilibration. The presence of Co in our formulations did not induce the formation of other crystalline phases in the equilibrated catalysts. This is at variance with the results reported by Hutchings et al. [22]. Using two different preparation methods they found that in one case the proportion of V(V) phases (detected by Raman) increased with % Co addition, whereas in the other case it was just the opposite. Zazhigalov et al. [23]observed the appearance of Co2P2O7 for the catalysts with Co/V>0.15. In that case, they concluded that cobalt ions are present in the form of cobalt phosphate which binds the excess of phosphorus at the surface of VPO catalysts. In our case, neither XRD, FTIR nor LRS were able to detect the presence of Co-containing phases in all the formulations studied (Co/V=0.19). However, TPR yielded some interesting data. The fast activated, non-equilibrated solid exhibits a low temperature reduction peak at 574K (Fig. 4). This is symptomatic of the presence of cobalt oxides easily reducible at low temperatures. These cobalt oxides disappear completely after equilibration and do form less reducible Co phases undetectable by other techniques. Through the use of XPS we tried to detect modifications on the catalyst surface produced by the addition of cobalt. Using both curve fitting and the correlation proposed by Coulston et al. [30]it was concluded that only V(IV) is present on the surface of the equilibrated catalysts (Fig. 7, Table 4). The P/V ratio of all the preparations under study is higher than the stoichiometric one and it is known that this favors the stabilization of V(IV). Our results agree with those of López Granados et al. [15]on unpromoted VPO equilibrated catalysts. Koyano et al. [9], albeit studying non-equilibrated catalysts, found by XPS only V(IV) species on the surface of those formulations made up exclusively of vanadyl pyrophosphate. On the other hand, Hutchings et al. [22]showed results at variance with our observations and those of other groups. They reported a correlation between the proportion of surface V(V), also determined by XPS, and the selectivity to maleic anhydride in catalysts promoted with Co. The same correlation was observed when plotting MA selectivity vs the V+5/V+4 ratio measured by Laser Raman spectroscopy. Note, however, that they made these studies using promoted catalysts held on stream for 78h, too short a period to produce an equilibrated solid. Both the surface cobalt concentration (Table 3 Fig. 6) and the catalytic activity increased with the percentage of impregnated cobalt. Besides, the least active VPCo4P has the lowest (Co/V)s ratio of them all. These findings seem to indicate that the presence of the promoter on the surface of the VPO solids enhances the activity and somehow reduces the selectivity of the equilibrated catalysts. 5 Conclusions One clear conclusion emerges from our data: the observations made on non-equilibrated solids cannot be used to interpret the behavior of equilibrated catalysts. This has been said many times for unpromoted solids and through our results and comparisons with other studies it becomes clear that the above statement is also applicable when trying to elucidate the role of promoters. The non-equilibrated catalysts contain cobalt oxides which react with the VPO solids while on stream to yield a hard-to-reduce Co-containing phase. No evidence for Co-phosphate formation was found, probably due to the low Co/V ratio (<0.19). The VO vibration was not modified by the presence of cobalt. The addition of Co significantly increases the overall activity while slightly decreasing the maleic anhydride selectivity. Non-equilibrated unpromoted VPO and those containing small percentages of Co show V(V) phases present in low proportions. Anyway, after several hundred hours on stream, the only phase detected in all cases was V(IV) vanadyl pyrophosphate. When the promoter is added during the phosphatization step, the morphology is somehow modified. This effect is not observed in impregnated catalysts.
