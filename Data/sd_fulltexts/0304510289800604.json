For Pd, Pt and Pd/Pt alloys, the average particle diameter is in the range 1.5 - 3.5 nm, these extreme dispersions being favoured by the reduction process: single atoms are generated by the molecular species bonded to the support surface, with subsequent collapse to a minimum particle size [2, 3]. Within this high degree of dispersion, important particle size effects can be envisaged [4], owing to the surface electronic and structural features such as increased flexibility of the crystal lattice [3]. These facts suggest that the ordinary solubility of metals may be in- creased in the case of high dispersions: thus, heterogeneous catalyst prepara- tion based on reduction of an organometallic species bonded to a silica gel support was extended to the Pt-Ag system. Moreover, a recent paper [5] reports partial solubility of silver in a platinum lattice for unsupported catalysts of Pt-Ag. A silica xerogel was obtained by hydrolysis of Si(OEt)4 in ethanol. The resultant gel, desiccated at 240 C displays a specific surface area of 380 m2 g\"1. The presence of OH groups on the surface was determined by reaction with LiH in tetrahydrofuran suspension (15.8 ml of H; evolved per g of sup- port). The powder having dimensions below 100 /xm was used as a support for a ca. 1% metal (Pt + Ag) loading. Primary precursor anchorage was per- formed according to reactions (1) and (2); in the case of bimetallic systems, when reaction (1) was completed, the solid was reacted with the desired amount of Pt(allyl)2 according to reaction (2): CHzCL,25 C silica/-OH+ [Ag(l,5-C8Hi2)2rBF4- > silica/- Ag(l,5-CgHi2) +HBF4+l,5-CgHi2 (1) Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 0304-6102/89/$3.50 L14 pentane, 0 C silica/ OH + Pt(allyl)2 ' silica/ Pt(allyl) + propene (2) The progress of reactions (1) and (2) was monitored by GLC analysis of l,5-CgHi2 and propene respectively. Species 2 and 4 were reduced in a tetra- hydrofuran suspension with NaBH4, to give the catalysts listed in Table 1. The catalysts were stored and handled under H;. Before using, samples were heated to 100 C and degassed at 10~3 mmHg for 2 h. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray analysis. This was performed with a Rigaku III/B MAX diffractometer, using a fluorophlogopite mica internal standard (SRM 675) for peak position measurement. Warren- Averbach profile analysis was accomplished to determine the average crystal- lite size. No microstrain was detected. The catalytic activity was measured for the liquid phase hydrogenation of distilled and purified 1-hexene. Kinet- ics were studied in distilled n-heptane at 25 C under 1 atm H; constant pres- sure. Reaction kinetics were followed by measuring the decrease in Hz volume vs. time. The main results are reported in Table 1. All catalysts appear well dispersed, although catalysts composed of pure silver and pure platinum display a lower degree of dispersion in comparison with those composed of Pt/Ag. X-ray analysis shows the presence of a single metal phase for samples containing 83 and 56 at.% Pt; the position and in- TABLE 1 Characterization parameters and hydrogenation activity of Pt Ag catalysts Sample3 Metal1' Ft\" Lattice Average Specific Intrinsic (wt.%) (at.%) parameter, particle surface catalytic (nm, l XlO-4) diameter0 area activity (nm) (?^-' 5) (104Ms-lm-2 0.5) AN1 1.09 100 0.3923 6.5 43 10.5 AN2 1.35 83 0.3939 1.2 247 2.2 AN3 1.16 56 0.3958 1.4 236 1.1 AN4 1.24 35 fO.3986'1 to.4060'1 5.5 6.0 107 0.5 AN5 1.11 12 |0.4021d lo.4086d 3.1 4.0 84 0 AN6 1.27 0 0.4086 10.0 57 0 RC1 1.32 65 46 7.0 RC2 1.13 31 506 3.3 RC3 1.29 14 54 1.7 ^RC samples are mechanical mixtures of AN1 and AN6 catalysts.

LI 5 tensity ratios of peaks indicate maintenance of the fee Pt lattice, although progressive modification of the original fee Pt signals is observed as the silver content increases. This fact is quantified by the lattice parameters shown in Table 1. However, X-ray analysis of 35 and 12 at.% Pt samples could not account for the occurrence of a single solid solution of the two elements. Figure 1 shows the peak deconvolution of the (111) signal for AN5 catalyst: while the greater signal can be assigned to a (111) peak of pure silver, the smaller shoulder represents a different phase assigned to a solid solution of fee Pt satured by Ag atoms. These analyses allowed the determi- nation of lattice parameters and average particle diameters for the metal phases corresponding to the Pt/Ag solid solution and Ag metal or to Ag- richer alloy. Results show that Pt-Ag solubility is incomplete, even in well-dispersed systems: samples with more than 65 at.% Ag are composed of separate phases of Pt-Ag solid solutions and almost pure silver. It is noteworthy that our results are in excellent agreement with those reported in the literature concerning Pt/Ag bulk phase analyses. In particu- lar, lattice parameters determined for our extreme dispersions agree, within the experimental uncertainties, with those previously found [6, 7]. The intrinsic catalytic activity of pure Pt agrees with previous results on catalysts obtained by analogous preparation methods [2]. The lack of any catalytic activity for pure silver was expected, owing to the catalytic proper- ties of Group IB elements: the hydrogenation of olefins is lowered by 3 - 4 orders of magnitude when the intrinsic activity of Group VIII metals is com- pared with Group IB elements [8]. The activities of prepared catalysts as a function of at.% Ag are shown in Fig. 2. The effect of Ag alloying on Pt is strongly detrimental and cannot be ascribed merely to the expected lowering of population of Pt active sites as the Ag percentage is increased; indeed, the catalytic behaviour of AN catalysts deviates from the linear trend observed for mechanical mixtures having the same Pt + Ag loadings. Both electronic and structural effects may be invoked to account for the dependence of catalytic activity on catalyst chemical composition. The electronic configu- Ag af/o Fig. 1.

The dotted line refers to mechanical mixtures RC1-RC3. L16 ration of elemental silver allows a net electronic charge shift on Pt atoms, which become less prone to olefin or H; activation. Moreover, the increase in the lattice parameter for Pt/Ag solid solutions affords a valuable increase in the nearest neighbour bond distance. This fact may give rise to the sudden deterioration of Pt catalytic activity owing to the relationship between intrinsic hydrogenation activity and nearest neighbour distance of atoms on the surface of metallic catalysts [9]. Thus, the trend illustrated in Fig. 3, in which intrinsic catalytic activity is plotted us. the lattice parameter, confirms the connection between structural organization and catalytic performance in hydrogenation reactions, and suggests a possible extension of the synthetic procedure described here to the preparation of supported bimetallic alloy catalysts where the intrinsic catalytic activity of ordinary elements may be enhanced.
