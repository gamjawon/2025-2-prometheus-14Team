Mallat *, C. B65nnimann, A. Baiker Department of Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry, ETH-Zentrum, CH-8092, Ziirich, Switzerland Received 11 December 1995 Abstract The influence of phosphine and aminophosphine modifiers on the performance of 5 wt.-% Pt/C and Pt/alumina catalysts was studied in the partial oxidation of L-sorbose with molecular oxygen, The molar ratio of modifier to surface Pt atoms (Pt~) was varied between 0.1 and 1.0. In general, higher modifier/Pts ratios resulted in higher selectivity to 2-keto-L-gulonic acid and lower reaction rate. The activity and selectivity of Pt strongly depended on the chemical structure of phosphine. Tributhylphosphine in trace amounts (modifier: Pts = 0.1 mol/mol; modifier: sorbose = 600 ppm) proved to be an outstanding modifier, which improved the selectivity of Pt/C by 28-37% in the whole investigated conversion range. Monitoring the catalyst potential during the reaction revealed that the oxidation state of Pt decreased by promotion, which is an indication that some side reactions leading to catalyst poisoning are suppressed. Keywords: Pt/alumina; Pt/C; Modification; Phosphine; Sorbose: Oxidation 1. Introduction The platinum metal catalyzed oxidation of alcohols and polyols to carbonyl compounds or carboxylic acids is an attractive, environmentally friendly pro- cess. Platinum metals can activate both molecular oxygen and the reactant under very mild conditions in aqueous medium (for reviews see [1-5]). Drawbacks of the method are the frequently reported high catalyst/reactant ratio required for obtaining full conversion, and the moderate selectivity of Pt or Pd in the * Corresponding author.

Mallat et aL /Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 103-112 oxidation of polyfunctional reactants [6-8]. The discovery of the promoting effect of heavy metals, such as Bi and Pb, represents a breakthrough in the development of the method [9]. There are several examples in the literature on the beneficial effect of a second metallic component on the reaction rate and selectivity [10-18]. The effect of these promoters (which are inactive in the reaction when used separately) is usually explained by a geometric blocking of a fraction of Ptor Pdactive sites or by forming new adsorption sites for the reactant or oxygen. A great challenge to the application of this method is the direct catalytic oxidation of L-sorbose to 2-keto-L-gulonic acid (2-KLG), according to Scheme 1. For the sake of simplicity the Fischer projections of reactant and product are shown, but in neutral aqueous medium at ambient temperature the pyranose configuration (glycoside) is the most stable form [19]. If the C-1 hydroxymethyl group can be selectively oxidized to a carboxyl group (without protecting the other OH functional groups and oxidizing 2,3;4,6-di-O-isopropylidene-c~-L- sorbose), three subsequent steps in the synthesis of vitamin C can be replaced by one [20-23]. A detailed study [24] revealed that under optimized conditions, using a 5 wt.-% Pt/alumina catalyst in neutral aqueous medium, the 2-KLG yield is below 40%. At relatively low pH (7-7.5) the reaction is slow and the catalyst deactivates easily, while at higher pH the selectivity to 2-KLG drops due to product decomposition. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the negative influence of promotion with Bi or Pb on the overall performance of Pt and Pd in alcohol oxidation. Recently, we proposed a new method to improve the performance of platinum in sorbose oxidation [25]. Traces of tertiary and quaternary amines (amine/sorbose < 0.1%) were preadsorbed on supported Pt catalysts. Strongly basic amines (with a pKa >~ 10) enhanced the rate by a factor of up to 4.6. On the other hand, approximately 40% increase in selectivity was achieved in the whole investigated conversion range using a cycloaliphatic amine hexameth- ylenetetramine preadsorbed on a 5 wt.-% Pt/C catalyst. Tuning the selectivity of Pt metals in hydrogenation reactions with strongly adsorbed organic compounds (termed as selective poison, modifier or auxiliary) is not new. Well-known examples are the Rosenmund-reduction of acid-chlo- rides to aldehydes using quinoline-poisoned Pd/C [26], the enantioselective I_/O~HL Pt / 02 / H20 HO~HH OH pH = 7.3 --OH HO----~H HO--~H CH2OH CH2OH L-sorbose 2-KLG Scheme 1. T. Mallat et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 103-112 105 hydrogenation of substituted olefins and carbonyl compounds on Ni, Pt or Pd modified with chiral auxiliaries [27-30] and the diastereoselective hydrogena- tion of chirally substituted aromatic compounds on rhodium modified with long chain amines [31]. Modification of Pt with amines represents a new application of this technique in oxidation reactions. The scope of auxiliaries can be extended to other types of organic compounds, which adsorb strongly on Pt and interact with the reactant during the reaction. In this paper the application of some phosphine and amino-phosphine type modifiers will be shown, using the indus- trially important partial oxidation of L-sorbose to 2-KLG as a test reaction. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials Compounds used as modifiers are designated as numbers and the correspond- ing structural formula are presented in Scheme 2. L-sorbose ( >/99%, Fluka) was used as delivered. Distilled water (after ion exchange) was used for the experiments. The catalysts were prepared by modification of a 5 wt.-% Pt/alumina (Engelhard Escat 24, Pt-dispersion of 0.3, as determined by transmission electron microscopy) and 5 wt.-% Pt/C (Engelhard Escat 21, Pt-dispersion of 0.26, as determined by hydrogen chemisorption). In situ catalyst modification was applied with water-soluble phosphines: 1,3-dimethylene-2-phenyl- 1,3,2-diazaphospholidine (1) and hexamethyltri- aminophosphine (2). Preadsorption of the modifiers was performed in the same glass reactor, which was used for sorbose oxidation (see below). 0.6 g catalyst I i /N~p~N~ ~Nx ~Iv/p,..N~ ! 2 4 fi fi Scheme 2. 106 T.

After 20 rain hydrogen was substituted to nitrogen, the proper amount of modifier, dissolved in 2 ml water, was added and the slurry was mixed for 90 min. Ex situ modification under Ar was applied for triisopropylphosphine (3), tributylphosphine (4) and diisopropylphenylphosphine (5). 2 g catalyst in 50 ml CH2C12 was reduced with hydrogen at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. After 30 min hydrogen was substituted to Ar, the proper amount of modifier was added and the slurry was stirred for 90 min. The solvent was evaporated and the catalyst was stored in air. 2.2. Oxidation of L-sorbose The oxidation reactions were performed in a 200-ml flat-bottom glass batch reactor equipped with mechanical stirrer, gas distributor, condenser, combined temperature and pH electrode (Metrohm, 6.02181.010), and combined reference and measuring electrode (Metrohm, 6.0415.100). Temperature was controlled with a water bath within ___ I. Oxygen flow rate (5 ml min-~) was measured by a rotameter. The reproducibility of catalyst potential measurement during reaction was within _+ 10 mV. More details of the method can be found elsewhere [32-34]. All potentials in the paper are referred to the reversible hydrogen electrode emerging in the same supporting electrolyte which was in the main compartment of the cell. 0.6 g of ex situ modified catalyst was suspended in 40 ml water under nitrogen and heated to 50. In case of in situ modification the slurry was heated under nitrogen to 50 directly after catalyst preparation. Then 2.2 g L-sorbose was added and the pH adjusted to 7.3 by dosing 0.4 M aqueous NazCO3. The reaction was started by substituting nitrogen to oxygen. During reaction the pH was controlled by automatic titration with 0.4 M Na2CO3. Samples of 1 ml of the reaction mixture were periodically taken, filtered and stored at 5. Standard conditions (pH 7.3, T= 50, Po2 = 1 bar, n = 1800 rpm, catalyst: L-sorbose weight ratio of 0.27, modifier: Pts = 0.1 molar ratio) were applied if not otherwise stated. Under these conditions the reactor worked in a transport limited regime, which is necessary to avoid catalyst deactivation by over-oxidation of the Ptactive sites [24]. The samples were analyzed by HPLC (Waters). The separation was carried out at 30 on a 250 4 nun stainless-steel column slurry-packed with Nucle- osil-5 NH2 resin (Macherey Nagel). The eluent consisted of 4.5 g KHzPO4/330 ml water/670 ml acetonitrile with a flow rate of 0.8 ml min-~ and a column pressure of 90 bar. Peak detection was performed with an RI detector ther- mostated at 35. Conversion and selectivity were obtained by using the external standard method. Concentrations were corrected for dilution during pH-controlling and for the effect of sampling. T. Mallat et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 103-112 107 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Amount of phosphine modifier The influence of the molar ratio of phosphine modifier to surface Pt atoms (Pt~) is illustrated in Fig. 1, using diisopropylphenylphosphine (5) and Pt/alumina as examples. The higher the modifier/Pts ratio, the higher is the selectivity and lower the reaction rate. (The minor difference between unpro- rooted catalyst and the catalyst possessing 0.1 mol phosphine/mol PtS is likely due to the removal of some impurity from the commercial catalyst during the ex situ modifying procedure). At high molar ratio (1.0) the selectivity to 2-KLG increased by 13-20% between 0 and 50% conversion, but the rate decreased considerably and severe catalyst deactivation was observed above 50% conver- sion. A molar ratio of 0.5 seems to be optimal for this catalyst-modifier system (60% selectivity at 70% conversion), but the actual value of the optimum changes with catalyst and modifier. In the following a relatively low phosphine/Pts molar ratio will be used to avoid catalyst deactivation. 3.2.

The strength of the effect of phosphines on the reaction rate and selectivity strongly depends on their chemical structure. For example, triisopropylphosphine (3) has hardly any influence on the performance of Pt/C, whereas tributylphosphine (4), the structurally closest compound to (3) among the phosphines tested, provides the highest positive effect on the selectivity to 2-KLG with only minor loss in reaction rate.

T. Mallat et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 103-112 109 Fig. 2 for Pt/C modified with (2) or (4). Tributhylphosphine (4) proved to be an outstanding modifier: it improves the selectivity by 28-37% in the whole investigated conversion range. The performance of (4) is especially remarkable when we consider that it is used in very low concentration: only 1 molecule phosphine to 10 surface Pt atoms (applying a rather unrealistic assumption that all the modifier is present on the supported Pt particles during reaction). A common feature of phosphine and aminophosphine modifiers is that they increase the selectivity on the expense of the reaction rate. Some decrease in reaction rate is expected as a fraction of surface active sites are covered by the modifier. In case of trialkyl-, triaryl- and cycloaliphatic amines, electrochemical model experiments indicated a clear positive correlation between the amount of amine modifier and the surface coverage of Pt [35]. It is assumed that phos- phines adsorb on Pt at least as strongly as amines, and a considerable fraction of modifier is present on the catalyst surface during reaction. Another question is the stability of modifiers during the oxidation reaction. It is known [36] that phosphines can easily be oxidized to pV compounds. When using (6) as modifier for Pt/alumina, the selectivity dropped rapidly during reaction and above 40% conversion the selectivity of the modified catalyst was lower by ca. 20% than that of the unmodified catalyst. This is an indication that triphenylphosphine (6) is transformed to an other compound (likely to the corresponding phosphine-oxide under the mild reaction conditions), which has a negative influence on the 2-KLG formation. The other modifiers (1)-(5) were found to be stable under reaction conditions, or at least their oxidative transfor- mation had no influence on the selectivity to 2-KLG formation (see e.g. Fig. 2). Note that most of the tertiary and quaternary amines (except triethylamine), applied as modifiers in sorbose oxidation [35], were found to be resistant against oxidation on Pt in neutral aqueous medium at 50. 3.3. Catalyst deactiuation In order to obtain more information on the role of phosphine promoters, the catalyst potential was measured during the oxidation reaction. A typical course of catalyst potential is shown in Fig. 3. After catalyst prereduction with hydrogen the potential is zero. Substituting hydrogen to oxygen the potential increases rapidly. It is an important observation that there is no base consump- tion (i.e., no 2-KLG formation) until the potential reaches about 0.7 V [24]. During the oxidation reaction the catalyst potential is around 0.8-0.85 V. It has been shown [24] that in this neutral aqueous solution the oxidation of adsorbed hydrogen is finished and the adsorption of oxygen (as adsorbed OH species at pH 7.3) starts at around 0.5 V. The higher the potential above 0.5 V during reaction, the higher is the actual OH coverage of Pt. As only the Ptsites are active in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alcohols, a too high OH coverage of Pt will lead to low reaction rate. The phenomenon termed 'over-oxidation' or 110 T.

'oxygen poisoning' has been widely studied [37-39]. One has to control carefully the rate of oxygen supply in the reactor, i.e., working in the oxygen transport limited regime, to avoid this type of catalyst deactivation. It also means that the reaction rates, shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1, are distorted by mass transport effects and they are only qualitative measures of the catalytic activity. It is not so easy to avoid an other type of catalyst deactivation, which occurs at the beginning of the reaction, when the reactant comes into contact with Pt. The so-called 'self-poisoning' of Pt means the degradation of primary alcohols and activated carbonyl compounds to CO and C xHy fragments on the clean Pt surface at ambient temperature [40,41 ]. For example, the adsorption of ethylene glycol, glycerol or glyoxylic acid in aqueous acidic medium results in a CO coverage of Pt between 0.55 and 0.8 [42]. The oxidative removal of these poisoning species requires relatively high catalyst potential, which explains why the oxidation of sorbose proceeds on Pt/alumina with detectable rate only above 0.7 V. Promotion with phosphines decreases the catalyst potential during sorbose oxidation by about 200 mV, but still there is no reaction below 0.6 V. A typical example is shown in Fig. 3. Note that the oxidative removal of CO from the Pt surface in aqueous medium is complete at or above 0.6 V [43]. A comparison suggests that phosphines can suppress self-poisoning of Pt or accelerate the oxidative removal of certain type of surface impurities, but cannot eliminate the side reactions leading to CO formation.

Conclusions It has been shown that modification of Pt with various phosphines is an effective method for improving the selectivity of the L-sorbose---> 2-keto-L- gulonic acid transformation. It seems that after a proper tuning of the conditions (e.g., the phosphine: Pt ratio) a considerable selectivity enhancement can be achieved with only a small decrease in reaction rate. A further systematic study is required to understand the correlation between the chemical structure of the modifier and its influence on the oxidation reaction. The present findings also indicate that modification of Pt by strongly adsorbing organic species may be a generally applicable method in liquid phase oxidation reactions.

All rights reserved Modification of supported Pt catalysts by preadsorbed phosphines: enhanced selectivity in the oxidation ofl-sorbose T. Mallat * C. Brönnimann A.

Fax: (+41-16) 321163 The influence of phosphine and aminophosphine modifiers on the performance of 5 wt.-% Pt/C and Pt/alumina catalysts was studied in the partial oxidation ofl-sorbose with molecular oxygen. The molar ratio of modifier to surface Pt atoms (Pts) was varied between 0.1 and 1.0. In general, higher modifier/Pts ratios resulted in higher selectivity to 2-keto-l-gulonic acid and lower reaction rate. The activity and selectivity of Pt strongly depended on the chemical structure of phosphine. Tributhylphosphine in trace amounts (modifier: Pts = 0.1 mol/mol; modifier: sorbose = 600 ppm) proved to be an outstanding modifier, which improved the selectivity of Pt/C by 28–37% in the whole investigated conversion range. Monitoring the catalyst potential during the reaction revealed that the oxidation state of Pt decreased by promotion, which is an indication that some side reactions leading to catalyst poisoning are suppressed.
