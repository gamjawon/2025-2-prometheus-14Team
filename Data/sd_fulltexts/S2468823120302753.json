Graphical abstract In this study, SiO2-supported Pd catalyst (Pd/SiO2) and CeO2-encapsulated Pd/SiO2 core-shell catalysts (SiO2@Pd@CeO2) were prepared and examined for CO oxidation. After aging at 700 ℃, the thermal stability of SiO2@Pd@CeO2 catalyst was improved in comparison to Pd/SiO2 because the CeO2 shell increased the structural stability and effectively inhibited the sintering of Pd particles on SiO2. Moreover, the differences in activity and properties of the catalysts were investigated through various characterization methods. The CeO2 shell induced changes in the chemical properties of the Pd particles adjacent to CeO2 due to the strong interaction between Pd and CeO2 (PdxCe1-xO2 solid solution), and the interaction improved the activity of the SiO2@Pd@CeO2 catalysts. As a result, the SiO2@Pd@CeO2 core-shell catalysts have an enhanced thermal stability and catalytic activity resulting from both a morphology effect and a synergistic effect between Pd and CeO2. Keywords CO oxidation Palladium Ceria Core-shell structure Thermal stability 1 Introduction As environmental regulations on pollutants emitted from automobiles have been strengthened, researches have been conducted to reduce fuel consumption and emissions of harmful materials [1–5]. Although new technologies to increase the fuel efficiency, such as reactivity-controlled compression ignition (RCCI), can reduce the emissions of NOx and particular matter (PM), the emissions of CO and unburned hydrocarbons increase due to the lowered exhaust temperature [6,7]. Hence, many studies regarding catalysts for automotive purification systems have been carried out, especially targeting CO removal through oxidation, since CO constitutes the largest portion of automotive exhaust and CO oxidation is an effective way to remove the pollutant at low temperatures [8,9]. For CO oxidation reactions, precious metals such as Pt, Pd and Rh have widely been used. Among the active metals, the investigation of Pd-based catalysts has been extensively reported due to the high activity of Pd for CO oxidation [10,11]. The thermal stability of catalyst and their activity at low temperature is an important factor to be considered because the automotive catalysts are exposed to high-temperature conditions. The active metals sinter at higher temperatures, which leads to catalyst deactivation [12]. Controlling the morphology could enhance the thermal stability and prevent the sintering of catalysts. In particular, the core-shell structure (core@shell catalyst) prevents aggregation or sintering of the active metal by encapsulating it within a metal oxide shell [13,14]. Moreover, metal oxide shells with high reducibility in the core-shell structure promote the activity of catalysts via a synergistic effect with active metal [15,16]. CeO2 has been investigated as a metal oxide for various reactions including CO oxidation reactions due to its outstanding redox properties (Ce3+ ↔ Ce4+), resulting from surface lattice defects (called oxygen vacancies), and due to its excellent oxygen storage capacity [17]. Hence, the core-shell structure with a Pd core and a CeO2 shell (Pd@CeO2) could be a promising candidate catalyst for CO oxidation due to the improvements in both stability and activity [18]. Several studies have reported that Pd metal decorated in the inner walls of the CeO2 shells (@Pd/CeO2 hollow shell structure) shown an enhanced catalytic activity that is derived from the durability and synergistic effects between Pd and CeO2 [19,20]. In addition, Cargnello et al. suggested that Pd@CeO2 (core-shell structure) catalysts show an improved activity derived from the interaction between Pd and CeO2 [21]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have been reported that have investigate Pd@CeO2 core-shell structure catalysts for CO oxidation both in the terms of improved thermal stability due to morphology effect and enhanced activity derived from the synergistic effects between Pd and CeO2. In this study, the Pd@CeO2 catalysts with an SiO2 template (SiO2@Pd@CeO2) were synthesized, because the SiO2 could increase the structural stability and thermal durability [9,22,23]. Through characterization and a comparison of the CO oxidation activity, the morphology effects and chemical properties of the SiO2@Pd@CeO2 catalysts were examined. The improved thermal stability due to the morphology effect and an enhanced activity derived from the synergistic effects between the Pd and CeO2 interaction were found for the SiO2@Pd@CeO2 catalysts. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation 2.1.1 Highly dispersed Pd/SiO2 catalyst SiO2 nanospheres were synthesized by using the Stöber method as reported in previous study [24]. First, 74 mL of ethanol (Sigma Aldrich, ≥99.5 %), 10 mL of water, and 3.15 mL of ammonia solution (Sigma Aldrich, 28.0–30.0 % NH3 basis) were mixed for 30 min. Next, 6 mL of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, Sigma Aldrich, 98 %) was injected into the solution while stirring vigorously. The mixture was stirred for 12 h, and the colloid was recovered by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min (SiO2 nanospheres). To impregnate the Pd particles with high dispersion over the prepared SiO2 nanospheres, amine groups needed to be attached to the silanol groups on the SiO2 surface. First, the prepared SiO2 nanospheres were sequentially washed with ethanol and 2-propanol (Sigma Aldrich, anhydrous, 99.5 %) and were dispersed in 300 mL of 2-propanol. Next, 2.65 mL of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (ATPS, Sigma Aldrich, ≥98.0 %) was added and the mixture was stirred for 2 h at 80 ℃, resulting in the generation of the amine-functionalized SiO2 nanospheres (SiO2-NH2) [25]. The SiO2-NH2 nanospheres were recovered by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min. Pd/SiO2 catalyst was obtained by conventional wet impregnation. To attach the Pd particles, the SiO2-NH2 nanospheres were washed with deionized H2O and dispersed in 480 mL of deionized H2O. Next, 50 mL of Pd(NO3)2∙2H2O (41.2 mg) aqueous solution was added dropwise into the SiO2-NH2 mixture using a syringe pump at a speed of 10 mL/min while stirring overnight. The colloid was recovered by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min, and the solid product was dried at 60 ℃ overnight. Finally, the prepared Pd/SiO2 was calcined at 500 ℃ for 10 h with a ramp rate of 1 ℃/min and denoted as PdSi_500. Meanwhile, to compare the thermal stability of Pd/SiO2 catalyst, Pd/SiO2 was calcined at 700 ℃ for 25 h with a ramp rate of 1 ℃/min and denoted as PdSi_700. 2.1.2 SiO2@Pd@CeO2 core-shell structure catalyst For the synthesis of the core-shell structure catalyst, CeO2 sol was prepared [26]. First, 2.74 g of ammonium cerium (IV) nitrate (Sigma Aldrich, ≥98.5 %) was dissolved in 40 mL of H2O, followed by injection of 1.5 mL of ammonia solution. The precipitate was recovered by centrifugation and washed with H2O. The precipitate was dispersed in 20 mL of H2O and then 3 mL of nitric acid was added at 50 ℃ under ultrasonic conditions until the solution became transparent. The synthesis of the SiO2@Pd@CeO2 structure catalysts was performed according to a previously reported method [27]. First, 9 mL of the synthesized CeO2 sol was added to the prepared Pd/SiO2 colloid, which was dispersed in 100 mL of H2O. After stirring for 30 min, ammonia solution was added dropwise until the pH reached approximately 7. The suspension was heated to 60 ℃ for 4 h. The suspension of CeO2 and Pd/SiO2 was then recovered by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min and dried at 60 ℃ overnight. The prepared samples were calcined at 500 ℃ for 10 h or at 700 ℃ for 25 h with a heating rate of 1 ℃/min. The SiO2@Pd@CeO2 catalysts were denoted as SiO2@Pd@CeO2_500 and SiO2@Pd@CeO2_700. 2.2 Characterizations The weight fraction of Pd in the catalyst was confirmed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) using an OPTIMA 8300 (Perkin-Elmer) at the National Center for Inter-university Research Facilities (NCIRF), Seoul National University. The morphology of the prepared catalysts and the size distribution of Pd were investigated by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) using a Tecnai G2 F30 transmission electron microscope (FEI). The high-angle annual dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping images were obtained using a Titan Themis3 Double Cs & Monochromated TEM at the Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI), Seoul branch. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded by a X-ray diffractometer using SmartLab (Rigaku) through Cu Kα (λ = 1.5412 Å) irradiation. The XRD analysis was performed in the 2θ range of 10° to 70° with a scanning rate of 1°/min. The Pd surface area of the catalysts was examined using CO chemisorption. Measurements were performed using an AutoChem II 2920 instrument (Micrometics). For Pd/SiO2 catalysts, 50 mg of sample was placed in a quartz tube, heated to 150 ℃ and cooled to 40 ℃ under a 50 mL/min H2/Ar flow. After purging with He gas for 5 min at 40 °C, 8% CO/He was pulsed every 3 min repeatedly until the peaks were equal. For the SiO2@Pd@CeO2 catalysts, the Pd surface area was obtained using O2−CO2-H2−CO pulse adsorption as reported by Takeguchi et al. to prevent the CO adsorption onto CeO2 [28]. 50 mg of sample was placed in a quartz tube, heated to 150 ℃ and cooled to 40 ℃ under a 50 mL/min H2/Ar flow. Then, a gas flow of 10 % O2/He at 40 ℃ was injected for 5 min, and 10 % CO2/He was fed to the sample for 20 min and then the sample was purged with He for 20 min. Finally, 10 % H2/Ar was fed to the sample for 5 min and then 8% CO/He was pulsed until the intensity of the peak was a constant value. The Pd surface area was calculated by assuming a stoichiometric ratio of Pd:CO = 1:1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were conducted on a PHI 5000 VersaProbe with an Al Kα X-ray source, and the binding energies were calibrated with the C1 s binding energy at 284.6 eV. The core electrons of Ce 3d, Pd 3d, and O 1s were examined. Temperature programmed reduction by CO (CO-TPR) was performed. The sample was placed in a quartz tube and heated to 150 ℃ for 1 h under a flow of He. After cooling the sample in a flow of He to room temperature, the TPR measurement was carried out in a flow of 1000 ppm CO/He at a rate of 5 ℃/min. The outlet gas was monitored by a gas cell equipped FT-IR analyzers using Nicolet is50 (ThermoFisher Scientific). In addition, a CO-TPR analysis under isothermal condition was conducted. Each sample in a quartz tube was heated to 150 ℃ for 1 h and cooled to 100 ℃ under a flow of He. The CO-TPR was then initiated by flowing 1 % CO/He, and the outlet CO2 was recorded. The temperatures at which 100 ppm, 200 ppm, and 300 ppm of CO2 detected were denoted as TCO2(100), TCO2(200), and TCO2(300), respectively. 2.3 Catalytic activity test CO oxidation activity tests of the catalysts were carried out using a temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) instrument. The tests were performed in a fixed-bed reactor, and a thermocouple was placed close to the catalytic bed. A 50 mg sample of catalyst was placed in a quartz tube and was pretreated with 100 mL/min of He gas at 150 ℃ for 1 h to remove H2O or other impurities. After cooling to room temperature, 100 mL/min of feed gas consisting of 1% CO, 10 % O2 in He balance was fed. The reactor was then heated to each target temperature with ramping rate of 5 ℃/min and was held at the temperature to reach a steady state. The outlet gas was monitored by a FT-IR analyzer (Nicolet is50, ThermoFisher Scientific). The CO conversion was calculated by Eq. (1), and T50 and T90 are the temperatures at which the CO conversions are 50 % and 90 %, respectively.

Fig. 1A and B are HR-TEM images of the synthesized PdSi_500 catalyst at different magnifications, and Fig. 1C is the size distribution of the Pd particles. The samples are spherically shaped silica nanospheres with diameters of 250−280 nm. In Fig. 1A, the Pd particles are invisible on the SiO2 nanoparticles because the Pd particles are highly dispersed on the SiO2 nanoparticles. In the high-magnification images (Fig. 1B), the Pd particles are clearly observed and have a narrow distribution centering on an average of 2.2 nm (Table 1 ). In Fig. 1D and E, the HR-TEM images of the PdSi_700 catalyst at different magnifications and the size distribution of the Pd particles are shown (Fig. 1F). In the case of the PdSi_700 catalyst, the Pd particles are clearly observed even in the low-magnification TEM image, and the Pd particles exhibit a broad distribution with a mean size of 3.7 nm (Fig. 1F), which resulted from the sintering of Pd particles at high temperature. Fig. 2 shows the TEM and STEM images of the prepared SiO2@Pd@CeO2 catalysts. In Fig. 2A and B, the CeO2 shells are hard to identify and the CeO2 is widely in contact with the SiO2 core. Due to the high electron density of CeO2, Pd particles are hardly distinguishable in TEM images. Hence, EDS analysis was conducted to verify the Pd particles and CeO2 shells in the SiO2@Pd@CeO2_500 catalyst (Fig. 2C and D). The SiO2 core is covered by CeO2 shells and the Pd particles were highly dispersed between the CeO2 shell and the SiO2 core, which is the typical structure of a core-shell catalyst with a size of 250−280 nm. Fig. 2E and F show the SiO2@Pd@CeO2_700 catalyst; the core-shell structure was maintained and had a uniform size of 250−280 nm even after aging at 700 ℃. Moreover, the distributions of Pd, CeO2, and SiO2 of SiO2@Pd@CeO2_700 (Fig. 2G and H) were identical to those of SiO2@Pd@CeO2_500. XRD analysis was conducted in the 2θ range of 10−70° to evaluate the crystalline behavior of the prepared samples (Fig. 3 A). The spectra of all prepared samples show broad amorphous SiO2 peak in the 2θ range from 15° to 30°. The PdSi_500 and PdSi_700 catalysts show XRD reflections peak of PdO(101) that appear at 2θ = 33.7° according to JCPDS card no. 43-1024. Furthermore, the PdO peak of the PdSi_700 catalyst was sharpened in the high-magnification XRD pattern (Fig. 3B), which means that the crystalline size was increased. As a result of the pretreatment at high temperature, the Pd particles of PdSi_700 became sintered and the crystalline size of PdO was also increased compared to that of PdSi_500. Meanwhile, the XRD peak of metallic Pd appeared at 2θ = 40.1°, and metallic Pd was invisible on the Pd/SiO2 catalysts. Therefore, it is surmised that Pd mainly exists as palladium oxide and not the metal state, which will be explained by the XPS analysis below. For the core-shell structure catalysts, SiO2@Pd@CeO2_500 and SiO2@Pd@CeO2_700 show fluorite CeO2 peaks at 2θ = 28.7°, 33.2°, 47.5°, and 56.4° according to JCPDS card no. 00-043-1002 (Fig. 3A). Hence, the formation of crystalline CeO2 was verified in the core-shell catalysts. Meanwhile, the signals derived from Pd species were not observed for SiO2@Pd@CeO2_500 (Fig. 3B). This could be due to not only the lower Pd content but also the higher Pd distribution in SiO2@Pd@CeO2_500 than for PdSi_500 and PdSi_700 (Table 1). The Pd particles adjacent to the CeO2 shell may form a PdCe solid solution similar to the PdxCe1-xO2 structure. Hence, the XRD peak regarding the Pd species disappeared for the SiO2@Pd@CeO2_500 catalyst. In Fig. 3B, the XRD pattern of SiO2@Pd@CeO2_700 catalyst is similar to that of the SiO2@Pd@CeO2_500 catalyst. The peaks of typical CeO2 are observed and the signals of PdO(101) at 33.7° are invisible. This indicates improved thermal stability of the catalyst and reduced sintering of Pd particles in the core-shell structure catalysts in comparison to PdSi_700. As a result, core-shell structure of SiO2@Pd@CeO2 enhanced the interaction between Pd and CeO2 [29,30], which resulted in the improvement of the thermal durability and structural stability at high temperature. The exposed Pd area and Pd particle size in the prepared catalysts are listed in Table 1. The exposed Pd area was measured by the pulsed CO chemisorption method, and the Pd particle size was calculated from the CO chemisorption data. After thermal aging, the exposed Pd area of PdSi_700 (0.88 m2/g) decreased compared to PdSi_500 (1.18 m2/g). The Pd particle size of PdSi_700 (5.3 nm) was increased compared to PdSi_500 (3.9 nm), which is consistent with the estimated results from TEM analysis. After CeO2 encapsulation, the CeO2 shell of SiO2@Pd@CeO2_500 blocked the CO adsorption sites, resulting in a significant decrease of the exposed Pd area (0.25 m2/g). However, the exposed Pd area of SiO2@Pd@CeO2_700 (0.25 m2/g) was maintained, while the exposed Pd area of the Pd/SiO2 catalyst was decreased after thermal aging. It is suggested that CeO2 encapsulation helps to maintain the exposed Pd area, thereby, preventing Pd sintering. 3.2 Chemical properties of prepared catalysts XPS analysis was performed to investigate the chemical states of the Pd/SiO2 catalysts and SiO2@Pd@CeO2 catalysts. The electron states results of the Pd 3d region are shown in Fig. 4 A and Table 2 . Due to the asymmetric behavior of XPS data, the spectrum could be deconvoluted into two sets of spin-orbit doublets. For the PdSi_500 and PdSi_700 catalysts, the Pd 3d binding energies at 336.8 eV and 342.1 eV are attributed to PdO, and the binding energies at 337.9 eV and 343.2 eV are ascribed to PdO2 [31–33]. Metallic Pd (Pd°) was not observed, but PdOx species were present in the PdSi_500 and PdSi_700 catalysts. In particular, PdO2 existed in the matrix of PdO even after calcination at 500 ℃ and 700 ℃, and the PdO2 ratio of PdSi_700 catalyst (0.40) decreased compared to PdSi_500 (0.44). Some studies have reported that highly oxidized palladium species (PdO2) are observed in Pd-supported catalysts [33–35]. Generally, although PdO2 species are more unstable than Pd° and PdO species [36], the stability of PdO2 could be increased to some extent depending on the surrounding environment of PdO2. For examples, PdO2 species may exist with improved stability in the matrix of PdO, SnO2, and NaZSM-5 zeolite [36–38] and represent the thermal stability in oxidative conditions, even at 700 ℃ [37]. Hence, although the ratio of PdO2 species in PdSi_700 decreased compared to PdSi_500, the PdO2 species exist in both the PdSi_500 and PdSi_700 catalysts. The Pd spectra of the SiO2@Pd@CeO2_500 and SiO2@Pd@CeO2_700 catalysts are deconvoluted and shown in Fig. 4A. The Pd 3d binding energies at 336.8 eV and 342.1 eV are derived from PdO species [39,40]. Moreover, the binding energies at 338.0 eV and 343.2 eV are due to Pd species that are in a more oxidized state than the Pd2+ species. The XPS peaks of Pd2+ shifting to a higher binding energy value in the Pd-CeO2 systems could be explained by the formation of a solid solution-like PdxCe1-xO2 structure in which the Pd2+ ions replaced the Ce4+ ions in the CeO2 crystalline lattice. In the core-shell structure, the strong metal support interaction (SMSI) of Pd-CeO2 [15,18], which is similar to the PdxCe1-xO2 structure [11,39–41], could be induced from the interaction between Pd and CeO2 in the SiO2@Pd@CeO2 catalysts. The incorporation of Pd into the CeO2 lattice is consistent with the above XRD results (Fig. 3B). Hence, for the SiO2@Pd@CeO2_500 and SiO2@Pd@CeO2_700 catalysts, the binding energy corresponding to 338.0 eV could be due to not only PdO2 species but also Pd2+ ion species. The binding energy at 338.0 eV is difficult to be used to distinguish peaks between Pd2+ ions and PdO2 because they are separated by less than 0.1 eV [40,42]. In Table 2, the PdO ratio of SiO2@Pd@CeO2_700 significantly decreased compared to that of SiO2@Pd@CeO2_500. This is because the thermal treatment at high temperature enhanced the interaction between Pd and CeO2, which promoted Pd penetration into the CeO2 lattice and the formation of PdxCe1-xO2 [8]. Fig. 4B is the result of an O 1s from the surface oxygen of the prepared catalysts. The O 1s peaks could be deconvoluted into OB (532.3 eV), OV (530.4 eV), and OL (529.4 eV) peaks, which refer to bridging oxygen in Si-O-Si (OB), O2− in the oxygen vacancies (OV), and the O2− in the lattice oxygen (OL), respectively [43,44]. As listed in Table 2, the number of oxygen vacancies can be estimated from the ratio of OV/(OV+OL) [45]. The oxygen vacancies of SiO2@Pd@CeO2_700 increased compared to SiO2@Pd@CeO2_500 since the penetration of Pd into the CeO2 lattice induces the generation of oxygen vacancies. As Pd2+ is substituted for Ce4+ in the CeO2 lattice, oxygen vacancies are generated to maintain the charge neutrality when Pd2+-O2−-Ce4+ linkages are formed [46,47]. Hence, the higher ratios of Pd2+ ion species after calcination at 700 ℃ caused the formation of PdxCe1-xO2 solid solution and increased the surface oxygen vacancies, which agrees with the result of the higher ratio of (Pd2+ ion) + (PdO2) for SiO2@Pd@CeO2_700 compared to SiO2@Pd@CeO2_500. The spectra of the Ce 3d region and deconvoluted peaks are shown in Fig. 4C. The four peaks from Ce3+ 3d (v°, v’, u°, u’ : 880.9 eV, 885.2 eV, 899.1 eV and 903.4 eV ± 0.2 eV) and six peaks from Ce4+ 3d (v, v’’, v’’’, u, u’’, u’’’ : 883.0 eV, 888.0 eV, 898.0 eV, 902.0 eV, 907.0 eV and 917.0 eV ± 0.2 eV), respectively, are represented [48]. The SiO2@Pd@CeO2_700 catalyst contained a higher ratio of Ce3+/Ce4+ (0.47) than SiO2@Pd@CeO2_500 (0.41) (Table 2). The presence of Ce3+ is related to the surface oxygen vacancies because the conversion of Ce4+ into Ce3+ induces the formation of oxygen vacancies [49,50]. Hence, as represented in Fig. 4A and B, the Pd2+ ions in the PdxCe1-xO2 solid solution are formed after high-temperature treatment, resulting in an increase of the Ce3+/Ce4+ ratio and surface oxygen vacancies. 3.3 Reducibility and oxygen storage capacity CO-TPR was carried out to investigate the reducibility of the catalyst and the CO-TPR results are correlated with the activity in the CO oxidation reaction [10]. The CO2 concentrations derived from CO-TPR are shown in Fig. 5 A. The PdSi_500 showed CO2 generation at 120 ℃, and PdSi_700 started to generate CO2 at 150 ℃. Moreover, TCO2(100), TCO2(200), and TCO2(300) of the PdSi_700 are larger than those of PdSi_500 (Fig. 5B). It can be concluded that the reducibility of PdSi_500 is higher in comparison to PdSi_700, since the reducibility of the catalyst increases as CO is oxidized at low temperature [10]. The Pd particle size of PdSi_700 was increased compared to that of PdSi_500, as shown in the CO chemisorption results (Table 1) and in the XRD analysis (Fig. 3). As a result, the higher dispersion of PdSi_500 may induce an increased reducibility, whereas the larger Pd particles of PdSi_700 resulted in a decreased reducibility [51]. On the other hand, the SiO2@Pd@CeO2 catalysts showed a significantly increased reducibility compared to Pd/SiO2 catalysts at low temperature. The reducibility of SiO2@Pd@CeO2 catalyst was enhanced due to the formation of the CeO2 shell and the interaction between Pd and CeO2. Meanwhile, the TCO2(100), TCO2(200), and TCO2(300) of SiO2@Pd@CeO2_700 are higher compared to those of SiO2@Pd@CeO2_500. This is because that the PdxCe1-xO2 solid solution is reduced at a higher temperature than PdO species [11], and SiO2@Pd@CeO2_700 formed more PdxCe1-xO2 solid solution than SiO2@Pd@CeO2_500, which was revealed by XPS. Fig. 6 shows the CO2 concentration profiles during CO flow without gaseous O2 under isothermal conditions at 100 ℃. Herein, the CO was converted into CO2 by oxygen released from the catalyst, not from the gaseous O2. Hence, the CO2 concentration could be correlated with the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of the catalysts [10]. PdSi_500 generated up to 270 ppm of CO2 and PdSi_700 produced up to 160 ppm of CO2, which is a similar result as the CO-TPR analysis showing that PdSi_500 emits more CO2 than PdSi_700 at low temperatures. On the other hand, SiO2@Pd@CeO2 catalysts demonstrated a greatly improved OSC. In the case of SiO2-supported Pd catalyst, CO is oxidized to CO2 via the oxygen from the Pd oxide species (PdOx + CO → Pd + CO2) [10]. Hence, the formation of CO2 by the PdSi_500 and PdSi_700 catalysts is contributed by the reduction of PdOx. On the other hand, when a reducible support such as CeO2 is used, the oxygen lattice of support improves the formation of CO2. As a result, for the SiO2@Pd@CeO2 catalysts, the ability to generate CO2 was significantly increased compared to the Pd/SiO2 catalysts, and the OSC was improved due to the formation of the CeO2 shell. 3.4 Catalytic activity test for CO oxidation Catalytic activity tests for CO oxidation were carried out for the prepared catalysts, and the results are illustrated in Fig. 7 . For the Pd/SiO2 catalysts, the PdSi_500 catalyst showed a T50 at 155 ℃ and T90 at 159 ℃. The PdSi_700 catalyst showed a T50 at 165 ℃ and T90 at 170 ℃ (Fig. 7A and B). The high-temperature pretreatment decreased the activity of PdSi_700 compared to PdSi_500. In the catalytic CO oxidation reactions, the high dispersion of Pd metal results in an enhanced activity of the Pd-supported catalysts [52–55]. PdSi_700 has a larger Pd particle size and a lower Pd dispersion than PdSi_500 because the Pd particles sintered at high temperatures. Hence, the decreased activity of PdSi_700 is derived from the sintering and low dispersion of the Pd particles. For the SiO2@Pd@CeO2 catalysts, the SiO2@Pd@CeO2_500 catalyst showed a T50 at 144 ℃ and T90 at 151 ℃ (Fig. 7A and B). Although the Pd content of SiO2@Pd@CeO2_500 is lower than that of PdSi_500, the SiO2@Pd@CeO2 catalysts demonstrated an improved activity for CO oxidation, with lower T50 and T90 values. This is due to the promoting effect of CeO2 and the enhanced reducibility derived from the interaction between Pd and CeO2, which was confirmed by XPS and CO-TPR. As a result of the synergistic effect of the Pd-CeO2 system, SiO2@Pd@CeO2_500 displayed a higher activity than the PdSi_500 catalyst. Meanwhile, the catalytic activity of SiO2@Pd@CeO2_700 was maintained compared to SiO2@Pd@CeO2_500, and the T50 and T90 of SiO2@Pd@CeO2_700 did not change after thermal treatment at 700 ℃. The Pd surface areas of the SiO2@Pd@CeO2 catalysts are identical each other (0.25 m2/g), since the core-shell structure enhanced the thermal stability and prevented sintering of the Pd particles. Hence, the particle size and surface area of Pd were retained, and the activity of the SiO2@Pd@CeO2 catalysts was maintained after thermal treatment. The TOF values of the catalysts are compared in Fig. 7C. The TOF for CO oxidation is defined as the amount of reacted CO per active site and is an indicator of the intrinsic catalytic ability. According to a previous study regarding the TOF versus Pd metal supported on SiO2 over CO oxidation, the TOF value is identical irrespective of Pd particle size, which means that CO oxidation over Pd is a structure-insensitive reaction [56]. When comparing the Pd/SiO2 catalysts, although CO oxidation is a structure-insensitive reaction, the PdSi_700 showed a higher TOF value than PdSi_500. Therefore, it could be suggested that PdO and PdO2 exist in different ratios in the PdSi_500 and PdSi_700 catalysts (Table 2), leading to different TOF values. According to experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculation results for CO oxidation, the PdO2 species have higher activity than other Pd species [36,57–59]. In particular, PdO2 species are more active than metallic Pd, and PdO2 species itself could be an active site for CO oxidation [58]. Hence, the PdSi_500 catalyst with a higher ratio of PdO2 showed an increased TOF value for CO oxidation compared to the PdSi_700 catalyst. Meanwhile, CO oxidation occurs at the interface between Pd and CeO2 for the Pd-CeO2 system, and CeO2 enhances the activity of the catalysts. For the Pd-CeO2 system, the penetration of Pd into CeO2 led to a PdO/PdxCe1-xO2 solid solution; within this solution, the important Pd active species for CO oxidation is not one particular species but a combination of both Pd2+ ion and PdO [11]. Moreover, it has been reported that an appropriate proportion of Pd2+ ion and PdO is significant to improve the activity [11]. Thus, the differences in TOF values for the SiO2@Pd@CeO2_500 and SiO2@Pd@CeO2_700 catalysts are derived from the proportions of both Pd2+ ion and PdO (Fig. 7C and Table 2). This finding corresponds to reported studies that claim the important factor for activity is the ratio of Pd and oxidized Pd species [60,61]. Hence, it is concluded that the optimal ratio of Pd2+ ion to PdO in the SiO2@Pd@CeO2_500 catalyst resulted in the enhanced CO oxidation activity compared to the SiO2@Pd@CeO2_700 catalyst with a suboptimal ratio of Pd2+ to PdO. 4 Conclusion We synthesized CeO2-encapsulated core-shell catalysts over Pd/SiO2 (SiO2@Pd@CeO2) to improve both catalytic activity and thermal stability. After thermal aging, the Pd/SiO2 catalysts showed Pd sintering, which led to the deactivation of catalysts for CO oxidation. On the other hand, the Pd particle size and activity of the SiO2@Pd@CeO2 catalysts were maintained after thermal treatment. During thermal aging, the SiO2@Pd@CeO2 catalysts formed a PdxCe1-xO2 solid solution, which prevented the sintering of Pd particles. The interaction between CeO2 and Pd in the catalysts enhanced the reducibility and OSC, and influenced the generation of Pd2+ ion species. As a result, the SiO2@Pd@CeO2 catalysts demonstrated the improved activity for CO oxidation and thermal stability at high temperatures. The results suggest that SiO2@Pd@CeO2 core-shell catalysts have an enhanced thermal stability and catalytic activity in CO oxidation, which are derived from a morphology effect and a synergistic effect between Pd and CeO2.

        "dc:description": "In this study, SiO2-supported Pd catalyst (Pd/SiO2) and CeO2-encapsulated Pd/SiO2 core-shell catalysts (SiO2@Pd@CeO2) were prepared and examined for CO oxidation. After aging at 700 ℃, the thermal stability of SiO2@Pd@CeO2 catalyst was improved in comparison to Pd/SiO2 because the CeO2 shell increased the structural stability and effectively inhibited the sintering of Pd particles on SiO2. Moreover, the differences in activity and properties of the catalysts were investigated through various characterization methods. The CeO2 shell induced changes in the chemical properties of the Pd particles adjacent to CeO2 due to the strong interaction between Pd and CeO2 (PdxCe1-xO2 solid solution), and the interaction improved the activity of the SiO2@Pd@CeO2 catalysts. As a result, the SiO2@Pd@CeO2 core-shell catalysts have an enhanced thermal stability and catalytic activity resulting from both a morphology effect and a synergistic effect between Pd and CeO2.",
