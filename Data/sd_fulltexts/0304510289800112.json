KALLO, GY. ONYESTYAK and J. PAPP, JR. Central Research Institute for Chemistry of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, H-1525 Budapest, P.O. Box 17 (Hungary) Summary The late transition metal forms of zeolites are active for some addition reactions; however their activity is difficult to attribute to the classical acidic sites. The reaction of ethylene with hydrogen sulfide on Cd- or Zn-FAU catalysts results in the simultaneous formation of ethanethiol and diethyl sulfide. The reaction is initiated by the heterolytic dissociation of H^S on the surface. In this process both high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) OH groups and SH species are formed. The disappearance of the corre- sponding absorption bands in the IR spectra on increasing evacuation tem- peratures indicates a stepwise desorption ofHaS. The surface transformation of ethanethiol, resulting in the formation of dissociatively adsorbed HaS and diethyl sulfide, can be followed by IR spectroscopy. The adsorption and the transformation of the sulfide were studied separately in the presence and absence of preadsorbed Hy3 by detecting adsorbed conversion products on the surface. Surface species of the acetylene hydration to acetaldehyde were investi- gated mainly on Cd- and Zn-zeolites. The modes of acetylene adsorption are discussed. The reaction between zeolitic water and adsorbed acetylene was followed by IR spectroscopy. Catalytic activity in the condensation reaction of the product acetaldehyde is correlated with the strength of interaction between cations in zeolites of different structure and acet- aldehyde. For Cd- and Zn-clinoptilolites this interaction is weaker than for the same forms of X- or A-zeolite. Crotonic condensation takes place on the latter and carbonaceous deposits are thus formed, resulting in deactiva- tion, whereas clinoptilolite catalysts preserve their activity. Introduction The activity of zeolite catalysts in a great number of hydrocarbon transformations is attributed to their acidic character [1]. Bronsted and/or Lewis acid sites may be involved. Moreover, the same acid sites are involved 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 330 in some elimination reactions, e.g. the dehydration of alcohols [2]. Similarly, acidic centres are responsible for the decomposition of thiophene to hydrogen sulfide and heavier hydrocarbons on H-Y, FAU and different metal forms of Y, FAU [3]. The dehydrosulfurization of ethanethiol proceeding on H-Y, FAU is also an acid-catalyzed reaction, whereas the activity of alkaline, alkaline earth and transition metal forms of zeolites for the same reaction cannot be correlated with the acidities directly, but rather with the electronegativities of these metal ions [4]. A similar correlation has been found for the reverse reaction, i.e. for the olefin hydrosulfurization, where Cd- and Zn-faujasites were found the most active catalysts [5]. Like dehydration of alcohols, the hydration of olefins to alcohols is also an acid-catalyzed reaction [6, 7]. The hydration of acetylene to acet- aldehyde, however, cannot be carried out on conventional acid catalysts. The ions of late transition metals only are active, especially if they are bound electrostatically to the zeolite lattice [8]. The deactivation of late transition metal forms of different zeolites has been investigated in detail [9]. It was found that Cu2\"1\", Ag\"*\" and Hg24\" are easily reduced by acetylene, losing catalytic activity. Cd2\"1\"- and Zn^-zeolites deactivate because of a fast exothermic reaction resulting in the formation of carbonaceous deposits. The crotonic condensation of product acetaldehyde was thought to be responsible for deactivation, which could be suppressed by ammonia pre- adsorption [10]. No deactivation occurred ifCd- or Zn-clinoptilolites were used [9]. The two addition reactions, i.e. the hydrosulfurization of olefins and the hydration of acetylene, proceed favourably on Cd- or Zn-zeolites. The aim of the present work is to elucidate the interactions between the catalyst and substrate molecules, and to follow the transformation of surface species during these 'not-acid-catalyzed' reactions. Experimental Materials A-zeolite (Serva, FRG), X, FAU (Strem Chemicals, USA), Y, FAU (Bitterfeld, GDR), mordenite (Norton, USA), clinoptilolite (in a rhyolite tuff from Tokaj Hills, Hungary). The mineralogical composition of the tuff is: 60% clinoptilolite, ca. 15% quartz and cristobalite, 5% feldspar and the rest volcanic glass. By exhaustive ion-exchange, it was transformed into the monocationic sodium form. The catalysts were prepared by ion-exchange with 0.1 - 0.2 molar solu- tions of the corresponding metal nitrates for 3 X 8 h at 70 C. The degree of ion exchange was 40 - 60%. Hydrogen sulfide was a Linde (FRG) product of 99.6% purity, ethylene was a polymerization grade product from TVK (Hungary), ethanethiol and diethyl sulfide from Fluka (Switzerland) were 'purum'. Acetylene was a high purity Dissous gas (dissolved acetylene cylinder gas) (ODV, Hungary), from which acetone was removed in a trap at 73 C. 331 Methods Infrared spectroscopic studies were carried out in a Perkin Elmer 577 double grating instrument. Catalyst samples of appropriate particle size were pressed into self-supporting wafers (5 - 8 mg/cm\"2) and placed in a cell provided with a heating device for pretreatment. The cell was connected with a vacuum system and a gas dosage accessory. The transmittance of the appropriately pretreated self-supporting wafers was recorded at room tem- perature. Results and discussion Hydrosulfurization of ethylene The addition of hydrogen sulfide to an olefin results in simultaneous formation of the corresponding thioalcohol and thioether [5]. Other products are formed in an amount of less than 1% on the most active Cd- or Zn-faujasites. In order to avoid the formation of different isomers, ethylene, the simplest olefin, was chosen. According to the kinetics as determined [5], the reaction is initiated by the equilibrium adsorption of hydrogen sulfide, which is followed by the rate-determining surface reaction between adsorbed hydrogen sulfide and gas phase ethylene; the adsorbed ethanethiol formed transforms partly to diethyl sulfide, and the equilibrium desorption of the two products closes the cycle of catalytic conversion. The adsorption of hydrogen sulfide, ethylene, ethanethiol and diethyl sulfide was followed by IR spectroscopic measurements. The samples were pretreated in a nitrogen flow for 1 h at 450 C. Under less severe conditions, much more zeolitic water bound to the cations remains in the sample and the recorded spectra are not clear enough. On a pretreated Cd-X, FAU wafer, the adsorption of hydrogen sulfide at 25 C results in the appearance of absorption bands at 3630, 3530 and 2550, 2400, 2345 cm~1 (curve 2 in Fig. 1). After treatments in vacuum at increasing temperatures, the second group of bands disappears above 200 C (cf. curves 4 and 5) while the high-frequency bands are detectable even after a pretreatment at 450 C (curve 6). The bands in the 2600 - 2300 cm~1 region can be assigned to S H stretching vibrations [II], and the bands at 3650 and 3550 cm\"1 to the high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) bands of OH groups present in faujasites [I], After the adsorption of hydrogen sulfide, OH bands shift to lower frequencies by about 20 cm\"1 (cf. curves 2 - 6 and curve 1 in Fig. 1). Owing to their acidic character, they dis- appeared after adsorption of ammonia. It is well known that hydrogen sulfide generates acidic sites on metal forms of zeolites [12,13], and the formation of acidic OH groups is attributed to the heterolytic dissociation of adsorbed hydrogen sulfide [14]: Cd^Z-); + HaS ^=: CdSH-^Z- + H^- (1) Our results are in accordance with these assumptions. Some other supple- mentary observations are, however, of interest. We found [5] that the 332 4000 2500 3500 3000 WAVENUMBER (cm-1) Fig. 1. Adsorption of H^S on Cd-X, FAU.

The maxi- mum is at Cd2'*' (the activity of the Zn-form is somewhat lower). The mode of hydrogen sulfide adsorption on Cd-X, FAU ascertained by IR spectros- copy enables us to understand the trend of hydrosulfurization activity of different metal-zeolites. In the range of increasing activities, the higher the electronegativity of the metal cation, the more pronounced the heterolytic dissociation of hydrogen sulfide. In the course of decreasing activities, the increasing strength of the Me SH bond hinders the transfer of the SH group to the olefin. The reversibility of hydrogen sulfide adsorption resulting in the forma- tion of acidic OH groups was demonstrated as follows. A Cd-X, FAU sample was pretreated at 300 C in vacuum, then HzS was adsorbed at 25 C and pumped off at 450 C (curve 1 in Fig. 2). The spectra after room tempera- ture adsorption of HyS followed by evacuation for 10 min (curve 2), after treatment in vacuum for 1 h at 300 C (curve 3) and at 450 C (curve 4) were recorded. The same procedure was repeated several times. The spectra after the successive treatments are shown in Fig. 2 (curves 2 - 9). The first three cycles are illustrated only for the sake of simplicity. No hysteresis can be observed even for a further 5 - 8 cycles; however, the acidic OH band intensities drastically decrease each time. Normal dehydroxylation cannot 333 3500 2500 WAVENUMBER (cm-1) Fig. 2. Adsorption-desorption cycles of H^S on Cd-X, FAU.

In our case the same structure should be restored after each cycle. Probably the following reaction takes place at lower temperatures, resulting in the disappearance of SH groups (cf. e.g. curves 5 and 6 in Fig. I): 2CdSH+Z- ^ Cd-^-S-Cd^Z-); + tl^S (2) At higher temperatures the bridged sulfide reacts with an acidic OH group (formulated as H^Z\") Cd-'-S-Cd^Z-); + 211^- ^ 2Cd2+(Z-)2 + H^S (3) i.e. the original structure of the catalyst is restored after reactions (2) and (3). The formation of strongly bound unsaturated hydrocarbons is recorded after the adsorption of ethylene on Cd-X, FAU. Since these products are not formed during hydrosulfurization, the transformation of ethylene should be investigated in the presence of flyS. The reaction on the catalyst film in the IR cell was modelled by preadsorption of HaS and thereafter by intro- ducing ethylene. Because only small amounts of products were formed and retained on the catalyst, the observations were uncertain. In a separate series of experiments, the ethanethiol adsorption was investigated on Cd-X, FAU (Fig. 3). The most important bands are discussed as follows. S H vibration bands around 2500 cm~1 are found even after evacuation at 120 C (curve 3). HF and LF OH groups are detected right after room temperature adsorption (curve 2) and their band intensities increase with increasing temperature of the treatment up to 300 C (curve 5). The generation of OH groups is attributed to the evolution of HaS from ethanethiol. Intensities and positions of the OH bands change as in the case 334 4000 3500 3000 2500 2000 1800 1600 1400 1200 WAVENUMBER (cm-l) Fig. 3. Adsorption of ethanethiol on Cd-X, FAU.

Fig. 1). The formation of diethyl sulfide can be observed as well: both the frequencies and relative intensities of the absorp- tion bands of C H stretching vibrations at 2960, 2930 and 2870 cm\"1 correspond to spectral characteristics of diethyl sulfide [15]. At 200 C the 1440 cm\"1 band of the (^^-^\"C deformation vibration of diethyl sulfide can also be detected [15]. The spectrum recorded after desorption of diethyl sulfide on Cd-X, FAU at 120 C is a bit different from the spectrum recorded after adsorption of ethanethiol at the same temperature, indicating that the latter does not convert totally to the former (cf. curve 3 in Fig. 3 and curve 2 in Fig. 4). In the case of diethyl sulfide, no absorption bands of SH groups can be observed around 2500 cm~1, and the CHa S C deformation vibration band at 1440 cm~1 is detectable. After pretreatment in vacuum at 275 C (curve 3 in Fig. 4) the band intensities change slightly, but the 350 C pretreatment (curve 4) results in the disappearance of diethyl sulfide bands and the appearance of HF and LF OH bands. The decomposition of adsorbed diethyl sulfide to Hy5 and ethylene can thus be concluded. When diethyl sulfide is adsorbed on a Cd-X, FAU film containing pre- adsorbed HyS, a very intense broad band appears at 2390 cm\"1, and HF and LF OH bands disappear. Presumably a hydrogen bond is formed between the acidic OH group and the sulfur atom of thioether, or a proton transfer takes place between them. The interaction is observable even after evacua- tion at 120 C, and the intensity of the HF OH band is still lower than for the original sample. 335 2500 2000 1800 1600 1400 WAVENUMBER (cm-1) 3000 1200 3500 Pig. 4. Adsorption of diethyl sulfide on Cd-X, FAU. IR spectra: (1) after treatment in N2 flow for 1 h at 450 C; (2) after diethyl sulfide adsorption at 1.3 kPa at 25 \"C followed by evacuation tor 1 h at 120 C; (3) after evacuation for 1 h at 275 C; (4) after evacua- tion for 1 h at 350 C. The IR spectroscopic observations are in accordance with the kinetic results, and permit deeper insight into the nature of the hydrosulfurization steps: (i) The adsorption of HzS results in heterolytic dissociation and takes place on one active site only containing most probably one Cd2\"1\". (ii) The adsorption of ethylene on Cd-X, FAU containing preadsorbed HaS could not be detected. The refinement of experimental methods may perhaps be helpful. (iii) The transformation of adsorbed ethanethiol to adsorbed diethyl sulfide and to adsorbed Hy3 can be followed. (iv) At 20 C higher than the temperature of hydrosulfurization, adsorbed diethyl sulfide decomposes to ethylene and adsorbed HaS. When H2S is preadsorbed, diethyl sulfide is bound more weakly to the surface, presumably through a hydrogen bond. Hydration of acetylene Two types of Cd- or Zn-zeolite catalysts could be distinguished [9]. One type deactivates rapidly. The deactivation process is accompanied by the formation of a considerable amount of carbonaceous deposits. The other type preserves activity for over 100 h without any deposit formation. The Cd and Zn forms of X- and Y-faujasites, A-zeolite and mordenite belong to the first group and those of clinoptilolite to the second. The activity decrease of the first group of catalysts can be slowed down by pretreatment with ammonia [10]. Showing all the characteristic properties, Cd-X, FAU is the most typical representative of the first group of catalysts. The IR spectra of Cd-X, FAU after pretreatment in vacuum of 0.1 Pa at 180 C, after acetylene adsorption at 2.5 kPa at 25 C for ten minutes, followed by a treatment in vacuum for 10 min at 25 C, are illustrated in 336 Fig. 5 by curves 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Two bands can be attributed to adsorbed acetylene: one at 3170 cm\"1 and the other at 1940 cm\"1. Both are IR-active in the adsorbed state only. The former is assigned to r(5C H) vibration, indicating an 'end-on' adsorption [16], the latter to f(C=C) vibration, indicating a 'side-on' adsorption [16]. Bands corresponding to the Raman-active vibrations of the gas phase acetylene are at 3374 and 1974 cm~1, respectively [17]. Simultaneously with the adsorption of acetylene, two bands appear in the region of 1600 -1700 cm\"!: the band at 1690 cm~1 has been assigned to adsorbed acetaldehyde (v(C=0) = 1720 cm\"1 in the gas phase), the other one at 1635 cm\"1 reflects adsorbed crotonaldehyde (its C=0 stretching vibration in the non-adsorbed state is ~1680 cm\"!). Two further absorption bands are also important, one at 1410 and another at 1360 cm~1: the former is attributed to asymmetric and the latter to symmetric C H deformation vibrations in the CH3 group of aldehydes [15]. Their frequencies are the same in the gas phase. On pumping off, bands of adsorbed acetylene disappear and concomi- tantly the intensity of the aldehyde bands increases (curve 3). These observa- tions suggest that (i) acetylene is hydrated with the zeolitic water even at room temperature, i.e. far below the temperature of the steady-state catalytic reaction, which is around 180 C [10]; (ii) acetaldehyde transforms instantaneously to crotonaldehyde; (iii) C=0 frequencies are lower and C H frequencies are the same as in the non-adsorbed state, both aldehydes seem thus to be adsorbed by the C=0 groups. Since the activity is attributed to the Cd2\"'\" ions and the kinetic product inhibition by acetaldehyde has been proved [18], the C=0 group of the acetaldehyde and likewise that of crotonaldehyde is thought to be bound to Cd2\"1\" ions. The spectra recorded at room temperature after subsequent treatments in vacuum for 1 h at 100, 200 and 350 C, are shown in Fig. 6 by curves 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The temperature increase results in the following changes in the surface species: (i) the desorption of acetaldehyde below 200 C is in agreement with its steady-state catalytic formation around 180 C; (ii) adsorbed crotonaldehyde disappears at 350 C, with the simultaneous forma- tion of hydrocarbon deposits, indicated by the appearance of absorption bands at 1450 and 1485 cm\"1 assigned to C H bending vibrations [15] and by a broad band at 1590 cm\"! which is assigned to conjugated double bonds. The propagation of crotonic condensation results in long chain polyenes tightly bound to the surface which block the active sites [9]. A separate investigation of the transformation of adsorbed acet- aldehyde was carried out. The more pronounced changes in the spectra enabled us to confirm the above observations. When Cd-X, FAU film is pretreated in vacuum for 1 h at 500 C, after the admission of 1.3 kPa acetylene at 25 C, more intense absorption bands are recorded at 3170 and 1940 cm~1 than previously. Owing to the con- siderably higher pretreatment temperature, a more extensive dehydration is attained and thus Cd2\"1\" ions become more accessible for acetylene. Even under these conditions, no oligomerization products of acetylene are 337 3000 2000 1800 WAVENUMBER (cm-1) Fig. 6. Adsorption of acetylene on Cd-X, FAU.

The same sites are occupied by water and acetylene. The adsorption of water is, however, much stronger than that of acetylene. This sorption behaviour has been predicted based on kinetic measurements [18]. Because of the lower water content after pretreatment at higher temperature, the intensities of the aldehyde bands at 1690 and 1640 cm\"1 are smaller. The same phenomena were recognized for Cd-A zeolite, but the absolute and relative amounts of the surface species were different. Cd-clinoptilolite was studied as a representative stable catalyst. IR spectra after 1 h treatment at 0.1 Pa and at 180 C, after 10 min adsorption 338 2000 1800 WAVENUMBER (cm-1) 1400 4000 3500 3000 1600 Fig. 7. Adsorption of acetylene on Cd-clinoptilolite.

After admission of acetylene, a weak acetylene band is observed at 3200 cm\"1 and a strong band at 1705 cm~1, corresponding to the C=0 vibration of adsorbed acet- aldehyde. Upon evacuation, the 3200 cm\"1 band disappears and the band at 1705 cm\"1 becomes more intense. When the adsorption of acetaldehyde is investigated under identical conditions, 5(C H, asym) and 5(C H, sym) vibration bands are also clearly discernible at 1410 and 1355 cm~1 (curve 2 in Fig. 8); in addition a new band appears at 2930 cm\"! assigned to the OC H stretching vibration in acetaldehyde [15]. The intensity of the acetaldehyde band remains virtually unchanged after treatment in vacuum at 200 C (curve 3). At 350 C acet- aldehyde disappears, with no residue formation (curve 4). When the temperature of pretreatment in vacuum is as high as 450 C, the intensity of the band at 3200 cm~1 significantly increases, i.e. the amount of 'end-on' bound acetylene is essentially greater, for the same reason as in the case of Cd-X, FAU. Zn-clinoptilolite behaves identically in every respect. The substantial differences found by IR spectroscopy between deactivating and stable catalysts are the following: (i) The 'side-on' adsorption of acetylene is absent on stable Cd- clinoptilolite catalyst. (ii) The OC H stretching vibration band of adsorbed acetaldehyde is absent for deactivating Cd-X, FAU catalyst. (iii) The C=0 frequency of acetaldehyde adsorbed on Cd-X, FAU is lower by 30 cm~1 than in the gas phase, and this frequency decrease is only 339 3000 2000 1800 1600 HOO WAVENUMBER Icm-'l Fig. 8.

(iv) In the case of stable catalysts, products of crotonic condensation cannot be observed, whereas they are formed instantaneously on deactivat- ing catalysts. (v) A quantitative thermal desorption of acetaldehyde can be attained in vacuum for both types of catalysts; however, crotonaldehyde and its oligomers transform on the deactivating catalysts into irreversibly bound deposits. Conclusions Two different addition reactions were studied, which are not catalyzed by the acid sites of zeolites but by late transition metal cations, most effec- tively by Cd2\"1\" and Zn24\" introduced by ion-exchange into zeolites. The surface reaction was found to be the rate-determining step both for hydro- sulfurization [5] and acetylene hydration [18], taking place between adsorbed H2S and gas phase ethylene in the first case, and between strongly adsorbed water and weakly adsorbed acetylene in the second case. The weak interaction between these zeolite catalysts and hydrocarbon reactants, proved by IR spectroscopic investigations, is also rather striking. The forma- 340 tion and transformation of the surface species could be followed by IR spectroscopy. Results are in accordance with those of earlier catalytic measurements, and in addition some further details could be recognized. References 1 J. A.

Papp Jr. Central Research Institute for Chemistry of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, H-1525 Budapest, P.O. Box 17 Hungary The late transition metal forms of zeolites are active for some addition reactions; however their activity is difficult to attribute to the classical acidic sites. The reaction of ethylene with hydrogen sulfide on Cd- or Zn-FAU catalysts results in the simultaneous formation of ethanethiol and diethyl sulfide. The reaction is initiated by the heterolytic dissociation of H2S on the surface. In this process both high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) OH groups and SH species are formed. The disappearance of the corresponding absorption bands in the IR spectra on increasing evacuation temperatures indicates a stepwise desorption of H2S. The surface transformation of ethanethiol, resulting in the formation of dissociatively adsorbed H2S and diethyl sulfide, can be followed by IR spectroscopy. The adsorption and the transformation of the sulfide were studied separately in the presence and absence of preadsorbed H2S by detecting adsorbed conversion products on the surface. Surface species of the acetylene hydration to acetaldehyde were investigated mainly on Cd- and Zn-zeolites. The modes of acetylene adsorption are discussed. The reaction between zeolitic water and adsorbed acetylene was followed by IR spectroscopy. Catalytic activity in the condensation reaction of the product acetaldehyde is correlated with the strength of interaction between cations in zeolites of different structure and acetaldehyde. For Cd- and Zn-clinoptilolites this interaction is weaker than for the same forms of X- or A-zeolite. Crotonic condensation takes place on the latter and carbonaceous deposits are thus formed, resulting in deactivation, whereas clinoptilolite catalysts preserve their activity. References 1 J.A.
