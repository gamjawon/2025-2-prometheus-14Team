The calculated results indicate that for MoSa the Mo S bonding is not very strong. The Mo atoms are held together through bonding with S and the S atoms are held together through bonding with Mo. Three types of S atoms may be distinguished by their location, coordination and bond type. The d band of MoSa is different from that of Group VIII transition metals and markedly influence its adsorptive properties. The adsorption of a thiophene molecule on MoSa is weak, the interaction is complicated, and little activation is indicated. It may be inferred that thiophene is first hydrogenated to tetrahydrothiophene and then desulfurized. Introduction MoSa catalysts have been widely used as hydrotreating catalysts for quite some time. Much work has been done in this field, and excellent reviews have appeared in this regard [ 1-3]. In recent years attention has been focused on characterization methods and fundamental studies concerning the origin of catalytic activity and the promotion effect of hydrotreating catalysts, and many interesting results have been published [4 13]. Various models [14 19] have been suggested to elucidate the fundamental aspects of activity from different points of view, yet there is no conclusive evidence in these respects. Chianelli [20] has done quantum chemical calculations for a series of transition metal sufide clusters and has defined an activity parameter which is well correlated with the activity. It was concluded that the calculated results indicate that the electronic factors are related to catalytic activity in the case ofhydrodesulfurization (HDS). But they did not elaborate on the electronic factors in detail. In order to discuss the detailed aspects of the electronic factor of HDS catalysts, MoSg has been chosen as the subject of the present quantum chemical study. The model and the calculation method used will be described below; next, the main calculated results are presented. The electronic and the bonding properties of MoSg will then be discussed, after which discussion on the adsorption of thiophene and tetrahydrothiophene will follow. Finally, some conclusions will be drawn. 0304-5102/91/S3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 322 Method of calculation and model clusters used The authors have used the DV-X^ method to study the adsorption of sulfur compounds on MoSg. In this method the exchange term in the Hartree Fock equation is approximately calculated as [21]: ^(r^-SaCS/STr)?^))^ where a is the exchange potential parameter which is chosen to be 0.7. The molecular orbitals are constructed as linear combinations of symmetry-adapted orbitals by group theory. The atomic orbitals are obtained by solving the atomic Hartree Fock Slater equation numerically and the configurations are taken to be Mo 4d55sl5po, S Ss^p4, C 2s22p2, H Is', which are kept fixed in the course of the self-consistent procedure. The Hamiltonian matrix elements and the overlap matrix elements are evaluated by the numerical integration method [22]. The whole calculation is performed using the Self-Consistent charge (SCC) procedure [23]. It is well known that MoSg crystallizes as a layered lattice in which the metal atom is surrounded by a trigonal prismatic array of sulfur atoms. These prisms are joined by their edges to form sheets, and these sheets are held to each other by weak van der Waals forces. It is commonly accepted that highly dispersed molybdena on AlgOs carrier is arranged as a one dimensional chain and that the skeleton structure does not change during the course of sulfidation. We have simulated this case with a model cluster of MoaS^ which is schematically represented in Fig. 1. We use the MoaSia cluster to represent the MoSg with a sulfur vacancy, which may be depicted as the 0 S 0 Mo Fig. 1.

The S superscript denotes the sequential number of the same kind of atoms in the clusters and this conventional will be used throughout this paper. MoaS^Hg cluster is used to represent MoSg with surface SH groups, which could be depicted as two H atoms, placed just on top of the S7 and S11 respectively in Fig. 1. In these models the Mo/S ratio is not stoichiometric. In order to examine whether there is any difference in electronic properties between the stoichiometric and the non-stoichiometric model, we have compared the MosS^ to the MoaSe and N105810 models. Since the latter two are stoichiometric and the former is negatively charged, differences in their electronic properties would 324 be revealed by the calculated results. The latter two models are sketched in Figs. 2 and 3 respectively. One of the present purposes is to study the change in electronic properties of both the adsorbate and the substrate after the adsorption of a sulfur compound on MoSg, therefore models of thiophene or tetrahydrothiophene adsorbed on MoaSia are designed. In these models the sulfur atom of the adsorbate is located just at the vacant position of S1 in Fig. 1, and the adsorbates are placed in a perpendicular or a flat-lying manner with respect to the x-y plane. If the adsorbate is perpendicular with respect to the basal plane, it will be lying flat with respect to the edge plane and vice versa. The whole model possesses a symmetry of reflection with respect to the y-z plane, since both thiophene and tetrahydrothiophene are planar. The Mo Mo, Mo S and S S bond lengths chosen are the crystallographic values for MoSg. The bond lengths and bond angles of thiophene are taken from [24]. The bond lengths and bond angles of tetrahydrothiophene are adopted from [25] and estimated from the general rule of organic chemistry. All these data are listed in Table 1.

(1) From Table 2 it can be seen that the bond orders between Mo and its nearest neighbors take an average value of approximately 0.35 to 0.45 for a trigonal prism containing one atom of Mo and six atoms of S. If there are vacancies in the trigonal prism of sulfur, such as in the case of MogSis and MogSio, the number of coordinated S atoms is decreased to four or five, the average bond order is somewhat increased, but assumes a value .of 0.5 at most. If there are SH groups on the surface of the trigonal prism, as in the case of MosS^Hg, or there is charge on the cluster, as in the case of MogSi4 or M03Si4 with external added 0.5 electrons, it is found that no significant change in the average bond order occurs. From Table 4 it can be seen that after adsorption of thiophene or tetrahydrothiophene, the bond order between Mo and S on the average is changed by a small amount. But it still falls into the above-mentioned range if the bond order between the Mo and S atoms of the adsorbate is not considered.

Thus it is suggested that, for MoSg, the Mo S bond is not very strong and shows small changes for different environmental conditions. Generally speak- ing, in a single layer lattice, the Mo atoms are held together through the bridge or triple bonding of S at the edges of the trigonal prisms, while for the main part, the S atoms are held together through the tetragonal or octahedral bonding of Mo atoms. 329 0.2 0 ;0.27 SUBSTRATE d) o H 0 C Fig. 5. Bond orders between pair of atoms and charges on atoms for: (a) thiophene before adsorption, (b) thiophene after adsorption, (c) tetrahydrothiophene before adsorption, (d) tetrahydrothiophene after adsorption. (2) In spite of the small changes of the average bond orders, the bond order exhibits considerable changes from one S atom to another in the same trigonal prism. For example, as can be seen from column 1 of Table 2, in the central prism for Mo1 of the Mo3Si4 cluster, the bond order changes from 0.289 to 0.533, and in the periphery of the prism, the bond order changes from 0.226 to 0.494, which is a factor of 2. Evidently the difference observed in the bond order is not caused by the position of Mo but by that of the S atoms. Indeed in every prism, Mo is coordinated with six S atoms and each S atom may be coordinated with a different number of Mo atoms. As indicated by Ratnasamy and Sivasanker [19], three types of sulfur may be distinguished by their locations in the crystal and by their coordination number with respect to Mo. The first type of S atom is located on the basal plane of the lattice layers and its coordination number is 3; the second type of S atom is located on the edge of the crystal and its coordination number is 2; the third type of S atom is located at the comer and its coordination 330 number is 1. From the first to the fourth columns of data in Table 2, it can be seen that for the third type of S atom, such as S1, S2 and S^S14, the single bond order value is the largest, while for the second type of S atom, S^S6, the single bond order value is smaller, and there is no first type of S atom in these models. We can gain further insight from the data of the last column in Table 2, where the third type of S atom S^S10 possesses the largest single bond order value, the first type of S atom S' and S2 possesses the smallest single bond order value and the second type of S atom S^S6 possesses single bond order value in between. Since the ability to form a bond is contributed from both Mo and S atoms, the bonding manner of Mo is the same in every trigonal prism, and that of S atom is different for the three types of coordination. The first type of S atom must form three bonds with three Mo atoms and the strength of each bond might be weak, while the third type of S atom only forms a single bond with the Mo atom and its strength might be greater; the second type of S atom forms two bonds of intermediate strength with two Mo atoms. This is exactly what is reflected by the corresponding bond order values. (3) Furthermore, as can be seen from the data in the second column of Table 2, for the central prism of the MosSis cluster where there is a S vacancy, the bond order varies by a factor of 3 from 0.286 to 0.763. It seems that after removal of a sulfur atom S', part of the Mo' S1 bond is transferred to Mo^S2 where S2 is located nearest the vacancy, and the Mo' S2 bond order is strengthened considerably. This increase in Mo^S2 bonding is interesting, since it is largely due to an increase in electron density in the orbitals, which are the d orbitals of Mo' and the diffuse p orbitals of S2. The vacancy created by the removal of S2 leaves an empty space to accommodate the electron density between Mo1 atom and S2 atom. Thus a stronger bond with a higher bond order is formed and the potential field may be fairly uniform. If more vacancies are present on the same Mo, the variations in bond orders may be different. Another interesting point is indicated from the data in Table 2, i.e. that the presence of SH groups modifies the bonding of MoSg significantly. For the MoaS^Hg cluster, the bond order of the S atom of an SH group with an Mo atom, Mo2-S7, takes a value of 0.197 which is small in comparison with the corresponding value 0.447 of Mo2-^7 for the MOgS^ cluster. Since S7 is bonded to the Mo2 atom only, this bonding is weakened significantly by the presence of an SH group, and it can be assumed that this SH group could be removed easily. The weak bonding of an SH group with a Mo atom would influence the other Mo S bondings in the same trigonal prism, as does an S vacancy. This point can be judged from a comparison of the first three columns of data in Table 2. As a small negative charge -0.5 is added to the MoaS^ cluster (102.5 valence electrons), the calculated bond order would be somewhat increased and the calculated Fermi level would be raised. (LUMO + HOMO)/2 will be referred to as the Fermi level E,. If the negative charge is increased to 1.8, then the Fermi level would be raised above the vacuum level, taking a value 331 of 0.32 eV., which is rather unreasonable. Therefore the non-stoichiometry of the Mo/S ratio might cause the MoSa cluster to be charged with only a small negative charge. From the above calculated results, it can be inferred that, for the present proposed models, the non-stoichiometry of the Mo/S ratio would not produce a notable influence on the electronic properties. Electronic charge on MoS^ cluster atoms As can be seen from Table 5, the total charge on all Mo atoms for the clusters containing three Mo atoms is approximately 1.7-1.9 eV, and the average charge per Mo atom is about 0.6 for all the models. The interesting thing is that in these model clusters the number of S atoms varies from 6 to 14, and even external charge is included for the case of MoaS^ plus 0.5 electrons. Thus an inference may be drawn as follows: For the model clusters of MoSg, a variation in the number of coordinated S atoms does not change the average charge on the Mo atoms. As for the S atoms, the average electronic charge decreases with an increase in the number of coordinated S atoms in the cluster with a fixed number of Mo atoms. Again, for each single Mo or S atom in the clusters the electronic charges vary considerably, and their values depend on the environmental conditions of the atoms and the entire surrounding conditions of the clusters. It appears that there are two factors which control the electron charge distribution. On the one hand, the cluster itself would like to possess a potential field as uniform as possible. On the other hand, there must be more orbital overlap to form sufficient bonding between Mo and S atoms in the cluster. Since the bonds are mainly covalent in nature, the electron cloud of the bonding orbitals would be localized between the nuclei of the bonding atoms. Generally speaking, if the total bond order to an atom with all its coordinated neighbors increases, then it will be more positively charged for an Mo atom, and more negatively charged for an S atom, since there is a small charge transfer from Mo to S in forming a bond. Conversely if the total bond order decreases, then it will be less positively charged for Mo and less negatively charged for sulfur. This is the consideration from the bonding point of view only. At the same time, if a uniform potential field is desired, a higher electron density would be transferred into the region where the electron density is lower. For the atom with a larger number of coordinated atoms, the electron density would be higher between the nuclei of the bonding atoms. In order to obtain a uniform potential the higher electron density would be extended to other regions of the bonding pairs, thus make the bonding S atom more negative and the bonding Mo atom less positive. MoaS^ may be taken as a concrete example. For the convenience of discussion, the region between the bonding atomic nuclei will be called the bonding region and the other region of the bonding atom pairs the nonbonding region. Referring to Fig. 1, S3, S4, S5 and S6 are bonded to two Mo atoms (while other S atoms are bonded to only one Mo atom), therefore the electron density is high in the region enclosed by S^S6 and Mo atoms. Uniform potential field conditions require that part of the electron cloud be 332 extended to the nonbonding peripheral region other than the enclosed bonding region of S3-^ and Mo atoms. Thus the S3-^6 atoms are made more negative and the Mo1 atom less positive. It seems that from the consideration of its distribution in space, the electron cloud would be extended toward the peripheral nonbonding region of the atoms with large coordinated partner atoms in order to form a uniform potential field. As a result of this uniform potential field, the total charges on the two basal planes of all the model clusters are almost equal. The above considerations may be helpful in understanding the charge distribution of other clusters, but this aspect will not be discussed in detail. As for the average charge on the atoms of clusters they would reveal the fundamental electronic properties of the Mo and S atoms, their electronegativity and their bonding of covalent nature. The rationality of the proposed models will now be discussed. As pointed out above, the non-stoichiometry of the Mo/S ratio in the models will not influence the electronic properties very much. At the same time, if the data of MoaSg, Mo5Sio clusters are compared with that of Mo3Si4, MosS^ plus 0.5 electrons, N103813 and other clusters, the same conclusions may be obtained for the bond order and for the charge distribution, especially concerning their average values. Furthermore, these models will reveal the properties of such interesting cases as the properties of the edge and comer positions, which are expected to be useful in elucidating the chemisorptive and the catalytic properties of highly dispersed MoSg on a support. Energy levels in MoSy, and related adsorption systems From the calculated results of all the MoSg model clusters, the following facts can be established. The valence d orbitals of Mo and the valence p orbitals of S interact to form a series of molecular orbitals with d character, and the energy levels of these molecular orbitals are spaced densely, almost like the energy band of a solid, which may be called the d band for convenience. From Fig. 4 and the data in Table 6 it can be seen that this d band is about 10-11 eV wide, the top of this d band lies just below the vacuum level, and the Fermi level passes through the middle of this d band, thus this d band is half occupied. The HOMO and LUMO are separated by only 0.1-0.3 eV. These properties are very different from that of a group VIII transition metal cluster, in which the d band is only several eV wide, and the Fermi level passes through the top of the d band, thus the whole d band is occupied [26]. This unique property of MoSg clusters will have a decisive influence on their adsorptive and catalytic properties. It may be inferred that MoSg could interact with adsorbates whose HOMO and LUMO lie over a wide range of energy levels. If the HOMO is high for the adsorbate it could interact with the unoccupied d band easily, if the LUMO is low it might interact with the occupied d band as well. The interacting orbitals might be adapted over a very wide energy range. Since the bonding of Mo with S is not very strong, the interaction of a sulfur compound with MoSg would be weak. This aspect 333 may be fully understood after discussing the adsorption of thiophene and tetrahydrothiophene, as presented below. Adsorption on MoSy, Thiophene is a model compound for the study of HDS reaction, and tetrahydrothiophene is the intermediate product of the reaction, thus these two compounds were chosen as the adsorbates to be studied. Before discussing the adsorption, some calculated properties of the adsorbates will be mentioned. As can be seen from Table 3 and Fig. 5, the bond order between S C(o;) is higher than that of C(a) H(ff), and approximates that of C(a) C03). There is ~0.3 positive charge on the S atom. The HOMO and LUMO are -7.1 and -2.4 eV respectively. With respect to the bonding character between S and C(o;) of each orbital, three are bonding and four are nonbonding or weak antibonding for the occupied levels of thiophene. These levels are all positioned in the same energy range as the d band of MoSa. There are also two antibonding unoccupied orbitals positioned in this energy range. As for tetrahydrothiophene, the S C(a) bond order is 0.43, much smaller than that of thiophene. The positive charge on the S atom is also less than that of thiophene. Its HOMO and LUMO are -10.6 and - 5.0 eV respectively. There are fifteen occupied orbitals and seven unoccupied orbitals lying in the same energy range of the d band of MoSg. In the occupied orbitals, seven are bonding and six are antibonding with respect to the bonding character between S and C(Q!) of each orbital, while the empty orbitals are antibonding. After adsorption of the sulfur compounds on the sulfur vacancy of MoSg, the sulfur atom of the adsorbate is weakly bonded to Mo with a bond order of 0.14 and 0.27 for thiophene and tetrahydrothiophene respectively. But the bonding properties within the adsorbate molecule exhibit little change, as manifested from the data on Fig. 5. It could be inferred that the adsorption is weak and there is little activation with respect to the C(o;) S bond. This agrees with the experimental finding that the IR spectra of thiophene adsorbed on MoSg catalyst is almost the same as that of gaseous thiophene [28]. As for the interaction of the orbitals of adsorbate with that of the substrate MoSz, it is rather complicated because of the lack of higher symmetry of the model and the wide range of the interacting orbitals, as can be seen from Table 7. This table presents some of the eigenvalues and components of eigenvectors for the Mo3Sis, MosSia thiophene and Mo3Si4 clusters. We are interested only in the interaction of adsorbate with substrate which might be seen from the components of Mo atoms in MoSg and components of S atom in thiophene. Thus only these components of the MoaSis- thiophene system are tabulated. The data of MoaSi3 may be used as the reference before adsorption, and the data for Mo3Si4 may be used to elucidate the nature of interaction from the bonding properties of MoSg discussed above. Since adsorption takes place at the vacant position of S' on MoaSis, the components of the S' atom for the MosS^- thiophene system is just the components of the S atom in the adsorbed thiophene. If we compare these 334 components with that of the S1 atom for the MosS^ cluster, it may be seen that the interaction of thiophene with MogSia is the same as that of S1 with Mo atoms of MoaS^, i.e. the p orbitals of the S atom in thiophene interact with the d orbitals of Mo atoms. But for the case of adsorption, the S atom is originally bonded to C(a) of thiophene, and the interaction is much weaker than that of S with Mo atoms in MosS^. At the same time the interaction of thiophene with MogSia produces little influence upon the bonding character of thiophene. A striking feature that emerges from the adsorption study is that it may be inferred, from the bond orders of C(a) S of thiophene and tetrahydro- thiophene before and after adsorption, that thiophene is probably hydrogenated first to tetrahydrothiophene and then desulfurized. This is so since the bond order of C(o;) S of tetrahydrothiophene is much smaller than that of thiophene, whether before or after adsorption, and the breakage of the C(o') S bond of thiophene is much more difficult than that of tetrahydrothiophene. Another significant fact is that after adsorption the Fermi level still passes through the middle of the d band, thus the adsorption systems could easily interact with other adsorbates. Since the vacant d orbitals may be used for further adsorption, this would form the basis for the double molecule probe adsorption characterization method [9]. The proposed models for thiophene on MoSg are too few to warrant further discussion; work including more adsorption models is in progress. Conclusions (1) In MoSg the Mo S bonding is not very strong, Mo Mo is antibonding and S S is very weakly bonded or nonbonding; the Mo atoms are held together through bonding with sulfur and the sulfur atoms are held together through bonding with Mo; three types of S atoms may be distinguished by their locations in the crystal, their coordination numbers with respect to Mo and their bond orders. (2) For MoSg the average charge on Mo is about 0.6 and the average charge on S depends on the Mo/S ratio; as for a single atom, the charge is determined by its location, coordination number and bonding manner. (3) The d orbitals of Mo and the p orbitals of S interact to form a d band with a width of ~10-11 eV. The top of this d band lies just below the vacuum level and the Fermi level passes through the middle of this d band, thus this d band is half-occupied. These electronic properties are different from that of a transition metal, and will influence the adsorptive properties of MoSg. (4) For the proposed models, adsorption of thiophene on MoSg is weak and produces little change in the bond orders of both the adsorbate and the substrate. From the bond orders of thiophene and tetrahydrothiophene before and after adsorption it can be inferred that thiophene is probably hydrogenated first to tetrahydrothiophene and then desulfurized to hydro- carbon and hydrogen sulfide. 335 Acknowledgement The authors thank Prof. Wang Hongli for reviewing the manuscript.
