The effects of I-hexene/ethylene, AlEt,/Ti mole ratios, the polymerization time and the polymerization temperature on [C * ] are reported. At the same polymerization conditions the activity in copolymerization is higher; however, [C * ] in homo- and in copolymerization are found to be more or less the same. For a low Ti-content catalyst, the addition of a small amount of 1 -hexene results in a two- to threefold increase in the rate of ethylene consumption relative to a homopolymerization run. Such an increase in the rate of polymerization is not observed for a high Ti-content catalyst. Interestingly, [C * ] determinations reveal that, for either the low or high Ti-content catalyst, [C* ] in homo- and in co-polymerization are more or less the same. The effect of the polymerization temperature on [C*] for both homo- and co-polymerization is also reported and the activation and propagation energies for the catalytic system under investigation are estimated.

In olefin polymerization, it is normally observed that the addition of small amounts of comonomer, e.g., 1-hexene, to an ethylene polym- erization system results in an increase in the eth- ylene consumption rate in comparison to a homopolyethylene run. The reason for this has been interpreted in terms of chemical effects [ $61, e.g., number and type of active sites, or in terms of physical effects [ 7-91, e.g., catalyst par- ticle fragmentation and diffusion phenomena. Tait et al. [ 51 have stated that both chemical and phys- 136 LA. Jaber, G.

The data in the literature on the effect of the type and the concentration of the alkylaluminium compound on the kinetics of olefin polymerization is difficult to generalize because different mate- rials and catalytic systems have been used [ lo]. However, it is generally observed that there is a continual increase in the polymerization rate upon increasing the alkylaluminium concentration in the low region. As the alkylaluminium concentra- tion is increased further it is often observed that the polymerization rate decays rapidly which can be explained by adsorption [ 11,121 and reduction reactions [ 13,141. Studies on the effect of varying the reaction temperature on the catalytic activity and on [C * ] in olefin polymerizations are very scarce. This article also discusses our new findings on the var- iation of [C * ] in ethylene/ 1-hexene copolymer- ization compared homopolymerization tion temperature. to [C in ethylene in dependence of the reac- 2. Experimental The experimental procedure, materials, cata- lysts and techniques for active centre determina- tion using the 14C0 radio-tagging method have been detailed previously [ 151. The oxygen-flask method used for the measurement of the polymers radioactivity has been described in ref. [ 21. For some homopolymerization runs the values of [C * ] were obtained at an earlier stage of this work and were evaluated using the radioactivity values obtained from the gel method [ 151, these [C * ] could be slightly higher since, as will be shown, it is found that oxygen-flask method yields slightly higher [C*] . Homo- and co-polymerizations of ethylene with 1-hexene were carried out in a slurry reactor at temperatures in the range 20-80 and an ethylene pressure of 2 atm. AlEt,/Ti molar ratios employed were in the range 20-80. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Effect of the Ti content and catalyst sw$ace area on the activity and [C The variation of the polymerization activity with the titanium content and the surface area for the various TiCl,/MgH* catalysts used is shown in Fig. 1. By almost doubling the titanium amount on the support, the surface area decreased by a factor of three, whereas the overall polymerization activity was reduced by a factor of about ten. Active centres determinations for the catalysts studied show that the reason for the dramatic reduction in the overall polymerization activity is the sharp reduction in [C * 1, Fig. 2, and not to a change in the value of the propagation rate con- stant, ( kP for these polymerizations varied only in the range 230-300 l/(mol* s) [I].

For the TiClJMgH, catalyst system, it is evident that increasing the titanium content on the support results in reducing the surface area, the polymerization activity and [C * 1. It has been emphasized earlier that the rea- son for the reduction in [C * ] with increasing tita- nium content is due to decreasing the ethylene homopolymerization centres [ 21. 3.2. C& copolymerization using various Ti contents and w-&ace areas catalysts The rate-time profiles obtained for ethylene consumption in homopolymerization and C2/C6 copolymerization using a TiCI,/MgH2 catalyst of 3.65 wt.% Ti, are presented in Fig. 3. At low initial I-hexene concentration the rate of ethylene con- sumption is higher than that in homopolymeriza- tion and is of an acceleration type. The higher the initial I-hexene concentration the higher is the initial rate of ethylene consumption; however, the rate-time profile is now characterized by a gradual increase followed by a rapid decay. In comparison to a homopolymerization run, it is apparent that the maximum rate of ethylene consumption in copolymerization increases by a factor of about three at an initial I-hexene concentration of 0.5 14 mol/l. In contrast, when using TiClJMgH* cat- alysts of more than 6 wt.% Ti, the rate-time pro- files, Fig. 4, show that there is no increase in the rate of ethylene consumption as a result of the comonomer addition. In order to explain the observations in Figs. 3 and 4, [C* ] were determined. Employing the scintillation technique, [C * ] values were initially determined using the radioactivity values using the gel technique [ 15 ] . However, it was found out that [C * ] in copolymerization are not higher than in homopolymerization as is shown in Figs. 5 and 6. In order to make sure that the radioactivity val- ues and consequently [C*] were valid, the oxy- gen-flask method was used to determine the 04. , , , ;, , ,: , -0.1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 [l -Hexene], mold Fig. 6.

Fink/ Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 98 (1995) 135-141 radioactivity values [2]. Employing the gel method, the polymer is frozen and ground to a fine powder in liquid NZ, then about 0.03-0.05 g are mixed with a very viscous scintillation gel. How- ever, using the oxygen-flask method about 0.05 g of the polymer are burned in oxygen and the lib- erated CO;? is absorbed in a basic solution. After- wards, the radioactivity of either the viscous gel or the basic solution are measured using the scin- tillation counting technique [ 151. The results obtained using the gel or the oxy- gen-flask method are shown in Figs. 5 and 6. Fig. 5. shows a comparison of [C * ] determined using a catalyst of 3.65 wt.% Ti; whereas Fig. 6. shows the variation of [C * ] for higher Ti-content cata- lysts, 6.98 and 9.94 wt.% Ti. It is clear that the oxygen-flask method gives higher [C*] when compared to the gel method. This emphasizes that the oxygen-flask method is a better technique for radioactivity measurements because of the more homogeneous scintillation medium in comparison to the gel method whereby a fine polymer powder and a viscous liquid are combined. The results reported in the present article show distinct phenomena. Firstly, in spite of the differ- ences in the rate of ethylene consumption observed in the homo- and co-polymerization, it is found that whether or not there is an increase in the rate of ethylene consumption as a result of l- hexene addition, the [C * ] either remain constant or tend to decrease. Secondly, the lower the Ti content on the catalyst surface the higher is the ethylene consumption rate and the higher is the concentration of the ethylene polymerization cen- tres. Furthermore, only with the low Ti-content catalyst is an enhancement in the rate of ethylene consumption observed upon the addition of l-hex- ene comonomer. The reason for this behaviour has been explained in terms of different types of active cen- tres on the various TiC14/MgH2 catalysts. It has been emphasized that a low Ti-content TiClJ MgH, catalyst possesses mainly ethylene homo- polymerization centres. Upon increasing the Ti content, the number of active centres for ethylene homopolymerization decreases and the polymer- 102 mol I tc.1 molTi 0 Polymerization Time I min. Fig. 7.

EfSect of the polymerization time on [C*] The variation of [C* ] in dependence of the polymerization time in homo- and co-polymeri- zation is shown in Fig. 7. In homopolymerization there seems to be an increase in [C * ] at the very early stage of polymerization, between 2 to 10 min, beyond which [C * ] is more or less constant. In copolymerization, [C * ] varied only between 7 to 10% mol/mol Ti. These results indicate that in homo- and in co-polymerization the concentration of active centres is more or less constant with the polymerization time. Similar observation in pro- pylene homopolymerization has been reported earlier [ 161. The decay in the polymerization rate, (e.g., Fig. 3.), with time could be therefore due to the continuous build up of polymer around the active centres thus making it more difficult for ethylene to diffuse to the active polymerization centres. The difference in [C* ] between the homo- and the co-polymerization cases could be due to the use of different TiC14/MgH2 catalysts of slightly different Ti contents and surface areas. When the same catalyst is used, [C * ] for a hom- opolymerization run is basically the same as for a copolymerization run, (Fig. 7. runs performed for 10 min polymerization time using the 3.65 wt.% Ti catalyst). This emphasizes again that for the TiC14/MgH2 catalyst system there is no increase I.A. Jaber. G. Fink/ Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 98 (1995) 135-141 139 14 12 l@.W ,(J Fig. 8.

Effect of the ALEtfli mole ratio on [C*] The variation of [C * ] with varying the AlEt,/ Ti mole ratio, in homo- and in co-polymerization, is presented in Fig. 8. The plot of [C*] against the AlEt,/Ti mole ratio in homopolymerization shows an AlEt,-isotherm type of curve. The con- centration of active centres reach more or less a limiting value above an A1Et3/Ti molar ratio of 20 in homopolymerization and about 50 in the case of copolymerization. This finding confirms the AlEt,-isotherm type of curve for [C * ] in both the homopolymerization of ethylene and copoly- merization with 1-hexene. In copolymerizations, there are two noteworthy observations. Firstly, the maximum number of active centres is generated when the AlEtJTi mole ratio is about 50. Sec- ondly, although there is an increase in the polym- erization rate [ 31, still [C * ] did not increase in copolymerization when compared to a homopo- lymerization run. In accordance with a previous publication [ 21, the active centres on the low Ti- content catalyst of 3.65 wt.% Ti are mainly hom- opolymerization centres. Therefore, the observed increase in the polymerization rate without an increase in [C * ] can be attributed to a diffusion phenomenon. In other words, the incorporation of the 1 -hexene molecules in the polymer chain leads to a less crystalline polymer and therefore increases the diffusivity of ethylene to the active centre. 3.5. Effect of temperature on [C*/ The variation of [C* ] in C2/C6 copolymeri- zation within the temperature range of 303 to 343 K is shown in Fig. 9. The active centres concen- tration determined using the oxygen-flask method yields a higher concentration of active centres when compared to the gel method. This confirms again that the oxygen-flask method is a better tech- nique for radioactivity measurements when com- pared to the gel method. The dependence of [C * ] on temperature in both homo- and co-polymeri- zation of ethylene is shown in Fig. 10. In both cases, the variation in the reactor temperature has little effect on [CL]. The differences in [C between the homopolymerization and the copo- lymerization cases could be due to the fact that these runs were performed using slightly different catalysts of different Ti contents and surface areas. 140 LA.

When the same catalyst is used in homo- and co- polymerization, Fig. 10 shows that, at the same temperature 3 13 K, a homopolymerization run yields basically the same [C * ] as in copolymeri- zation. The overall activation energy, E,, and the prop- agation energy, Ep, were evaluated using an Arrhenius type of plots and using the formula: V,=&JMl - [C*l whereby kP=A.e-RT In the case where the value of [C * ] independence of temperature is not known then Eq. ( 1) is used to estimate E,: ln(V,/[M]) = -E,/RT+ln(A* [C) (1) However, if [C* ] is known then Eq. (2) is employed to estimate Ep: ln(V,/([M].[C*]))= -E,/RT+ln(A) (2) Thus the overall activation, E,, is obtained from the slope of the plot In ( VP/ [M] ) versus 1 /T, as is shown in Fig. 11 (lower line). The plot is observed to consist of two linear parts. This shape of plot has been observed by many workers in this field, e.g., [ 171. The break in the line at = 323 K could originate from the destruction of active cen- tres at high polymerization temperatures. The E, value obtained from the line in the temperature range 293 to 323 is estimated to be about 44.8 kJ/ mol. This value is in excellent agreement of pre- vious estimation of E, for the TiC14/MgH2 catalyst, whereby a value of 45 kJ/mol was reported [ 181. In addition, this value is in good agreement with other published values in the lit- erature for olefin polymerizations; for example, Keii et al. [ 171 and Chien et al. [ 191 have both reported a value of 50 kJ/mol activation energy in the polymerization of propylene. Most of the E, values reported in the literature did not however include the variation of active centres with temperature in the activation energy evaluation. In the present investigation, the prop- agation energy, Ep, can be evaluated using Eq. (2). This is also shown in Fig. 11 (upper line). The propagation energy estimated from the slope of the linear part (temperature range 293-323 K) gave a value of 33.4 kI/mol. The difference between E, (44.8 kI/mol) and Ep (33.4 kI/mol) is rather small. This means that for the catalyst system under investigation the temperature dependence of [C * ] is, if at all, very small. 4. Conclusion The results reported in this article and preceding publications [ 1,2,18] emphasize that the reason for the substantial increase in the rate of ethylene consumption in copolymerization when a low Ti- content catalyst was used is because the active centres on this type of catalyst are mainly homo- polymerization centres. In other words, lowering the crystallinity of the polymer particles as a result of the comonomer incorporation led to faster dif- fusion of ethylene and to an increase in the rate of ethylene consumption. In contrast, the reason that no rate enhancement in copolymerization was observed when a high Ti-content catalyst was used is because the active centres on this type of catalyst are mainly copolymerization centres. In this case, lowering the crystallinity of the polymer particles did not have an effect on the ethylene consumption rate because the active centres in this case are not suitable for ethylene polymerization. For a partic- ular TiC&/MgH* catalyst of certain Ti content and surface area the results emphasize that the sum of active centres is constant. LA. Jaber, G. Fink/Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 98 (199.5) 135-141 141 For the TiC14/MgH2 catalyst system in ethyl- ene, homo- and co-polymerization requires an optimal AlEtJTi mole ratio of about 50 to achieve maximum activity and a maximum number of active centres. In homo- and in co-polymerization, the results obtained indicate that the plot of [C * ] against the AlEtJTi mole ratio follows an AlEt,- isotherm type of curve. Furthermore, for the cat- alyst system under investigation the difference between E, and Ep is 11.4 kJ/mol, (2.7 kcal/ mol), this indicate that the temperature depend- ence of [C * ] is rather small.

(+49-208)3062980 The determination of active centres concentration, [C∗], by the 14CO radio-labelling technique in ethylene homopolymerization and copolymerization with 1-hexene using various TiCl4 MgH2 catalysts of different Ti contents and surface areas is discussed. The effects of 1-hexene/ethylene, AlEt3 Ti mole ratios, the polymerization time and the polymerization temperature on [C∗] are reported. At the same polymerization conditions the activity in copolymerization is higher; however, [C∗] in homo- and in copolymerization are found to be more or less the same. For a low Ti-content catalyst, the addition of a small amount of 1-hexene results in a two- to threefold increase in the rate of ethylene consumption relative to a homopolymerization run. Such an increase in the rate of polymerization is not observed for a high Ti-content catalyst. Interestingly, [C∗] determinations reveal that, for either the low or high Ti-content catalyst, [C∗] in homo- and in co-polymerization are more or less the same. The effect of the polymerization temperature on [C∗] for both homo- and co-polymerization is also reported and the activation and propagation energies for the catalytic system under investigation are estimated.
