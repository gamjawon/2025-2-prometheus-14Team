Division of Materials and Manufacturing Science Graduate School of Engineering Osaka University 2-1 Yamadaoka Suita Osaka 565-0871 Japan Graphical abstract A promotional effect of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) on direct hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) formation from H2 and O2 over a structure-controlled Pd-Au catalytic system is reported herein. Pd NPs supported on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) layer-coated Au nanorod (NR) nanocomposite catalysts were synthesized, and the structure was confirmed by multiple characterization techniques. H2O2 production is highly enhanced under visible light irradiation in the direct H2O2 formation from H2 and O2. The H2O2 decomposition test and the H2-D2 exchange reaction reveal that the SPR of Au NRs facilitates H2 activation on the Pd NP surface, leading to efficient H2O2 production. Furthermore, the rGO layer not only functions as an electron mediator in the catalytic reaction, but also contributes to the control of Pd NP sizes in the catalyst synthesis. Keywords Surface plasmon resonance Hydrogen peroxide synthesis Reduced graphene oxide Gold nanorod Heterogeneous catalysis 1 Introduction Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is extensively utilized in industry as an environmentally friendly oxidant. At present, H2O2 is produced by an anthraquinone autooxidation method; however, the high energy requirement due to the multistep reaction process is a serious drawback [1,2]. The direct synthesis of H2O2 from H2 and O2 gases is conceptually the most straightforward process, and has attracted much attention as an alternative process with low energy consumption [3–5]. Pd-based catalysts have been known to efficiently produce H2O2 in the direct process [6,7]. However, Pd is also active for H2O synthesis. Consequently, the produced H2O2 is easily converted to H2O through decomposition and hydrogenation pathways, and therefore, achieving both activity improvement for H2O2 synthesis and suppression of H2O2 decomposition is needed [8–11]. In other words, the promotion of H2 activation while preventing O-O bond dissociation is a key factor for efficient and selective H2O2 formation [11–13]. In order to enhance the H2O2 productivity, a number of Pd-based alloy catalysts have been studied, where electronic and geometric effects contribute to the improvement of H2O2 selectivity or the suppression of H2O2 decomposition [2,5,6,10–12]. However, the selective H2O2 formation with Pd catalysts remains to be a challenging task despite a lot of efforts, and a new approach is desired. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR), a photon-induced collective oscillation of electrons at the surface of noble metals, has lately come into focus in photocatalysis [14–20]. In photochemical processes, the excitation of SPR produces energetic hot electrons, which can be injected into specific orbitals of molecules adsorbed on the metal surface [21,22]. Specific reaction substrates and intermediates are activated, and thus, not only reaction rates, but also product selectivity can be controlled by the assistance of SPR [23,24]. N. J. Halas et al. have recently reported the SPR-induced dissociation of H2 on Au NPs under visible light irradiation, in which hot electrons produced by the SPR of Au NPs can be transferred into a contacted H2 molecule [25,26]. On the basis of these studies, the SPR-driven H2 activation could promote the direct H2O2 production from H2 and O2, without acceleration of H2O2 decomposition. In this study, we present the promotional effect of SPR on the direct H2O2 formation from H2 and O2 over Pd nanoparticles deposited on graphene-Au nanorod (NR) nanocomposite catalysts. A large SPR-driven rate enhancement in the production of H2O2 is observed under visible light irradiation. It is demonstrated that the SPR of Au selectively facilitates H2 activation, but not H2O2 decomposition on Pd, resulting in efficient H2O2 production. This study not only provides the first example of H2O2 production by the assistance of SPR of Au NRs, but also offers design guidelines for developing plasmonic nanocomposite catalysts for selective H2O2 formation. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Sulfuric acid (H2SO4), sodium nitrate (NaNO3), potassium permanganate (KMnO4), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30%), hydrogen tetrachloroaurate(III) tetrahydrate (HAuCl4·4H2O), sodium borohydride (NaBH4), silver nitrate (AgNO3), L(+)-ascorbic acid (C6H8O6), disodium tetrachloropalladate(II) (Na2PdCl4), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 16.9%), disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (NaHPO4), citric acid (C6H8O7), and perchloric acid (HClO4, 60%) were purchased from Nacalai Tesque Inc. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (C19H42BrN) was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Ind. Co., Ltd. Graphite powder and Oxo[5,10,15,20-tetra(4-pyridyl)porphinato]titanium(IV) ([TiO(tpypH4)]4+) were obtained from Kishida Chemical Co., Ltd and Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd, respectively. All chemicals were used without further purification. 2.2 Synthesis of PdNPs/Au@rGO First, the graphene oxide (GO)-coated Au NR colloids (Au@GO) were prepared based on our previously reported methods [27–29]. Au NRs (aspect ratio = 3) were synthesized using a seed-mediated method, and nanosized GO suspension was prepared with a modified Hammer’s method, followed by ultrasonication for exfoliation of GO sheets [28]. The Au NR colloids (98.0 mg/L, 20 mL) were centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 15 min to remove excess surfactant and the precipitants were re-dispersed in 20 mL of H2O. The nanosized GO suspension (32.1 mg/L, 10 mL) was added to an Au NR colloid suspension (20 mL) and left at room temperature overnight. The obtained colloids are denoted as Au@GO. In the next synthetic step, Pd nanoparticles (NPs) were formed on the carbon layer. A Na2PdCl4 solution (10 mM, 141 μL) was added to Au@GO and stirred for 15 min (denoted as Pd2+/Au@GO). The prepared colloidal suspension was then reduced by continuous hydrogen bubbling through the suspension at 50 °C for 30 min. At the same time, the GO layer was partially reduced to reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to afford Pd NPs supported on rGO-coated Au NR colloids (denoted as PdNPs/Au@rGO). No sedimentation was observed in the colloidal suspension even after several months. The Pd content was calculated to be 7.2 wt% in PdNPs/Au@rGO. 2.3 Synthesis of reference catalysts Reference catalysts were synthesized by a similar procedure as PdNPs/Au@rGO. PdNPs/rGO was synthesized by the impregnation of Na2PdCl4 solution (10 mM, 56.4 μL) on GO (20 mg) and the hydrogen reduction as described above (50 °C, 30 min). PdNPs/Au was prepared without the addition of the nanosized GO suspension in the PdNPs/Au@rGO synthesis. 2.4 Characterization Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a field emission-transmission electron microscope (FE-TEM; Hitachi Hf-2000) operated at 200 kV. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images and elemental mappings were obtained using a JEOL-ARM 200F equipped with a Kvex energy-dispersive X-ray detector (JED-2300T) operated at 200 kV. Raman spectroscopy measurement was performed using a laser Raman confocal microscope (Nanophoton, RAMAN-11) using an excitation wavelength of 532 nm through a 20x objective. Colloidal samples were deposited on quartz slides, and then, dried under reduced pressure at room temperature. UV visible absorption spectra were examined using a Shimadzu UV-2600 UV–vis spectrophotometer with a quartz cell (light-path length = 1.0 cm) at room temperature. Pd K-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectra were recorded in fluorescence mode at 01B1 beamline at the SPring-8, JASRI, Harima, Japan, using a Si(1 1 1) monochromator. The Fourier transform was applied to the k 3-weighted normalized extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data over the range of 3.0 < k (Å−1) < 12 to obtain radial structure functions using a Rigaku software REX2000. The zeta potential was measured using a zeta potential analyzer (Otsuka Electronics Co., Ltd., ELSZ-2000). The pH of each suspension was adjusted to 6 by using McIlvaine buffer solution. 2.5 Catalytic test The catalytic performance was evaluated by the direct hydrogen peroxide formation from hydrogen and oxygen. In a typical procedure, the colloidal suspension containing catalyst (10 mL) and HCl (1 M, 100 μL) were added into a glass reactor for pH adjustment. The reactor was placed in a water bath at 15 °C under continuous stirring in the dark or under visible light irradiation (500 W Xe lamp (SAN-EI ELECTRIC Co., Ltd., XEF-501S) with a 420 nm long-pass filter), and the reaction was initiated by bubbling a gas mixture containing hydrogen gas (10 mL/min) and oxygen gas (10 mL/min) through the suspension. The visible light intensity was set to I = 120 mW/cm2. The amount of produced H2O2 was examined by spectroscopic titration with an acidic solution of [TiO(tpypH4)]4+ complex (TiP reagent) [30]. The TiP reagent was prepared by dissolving the [TiO(tpypH4)]4+ complex (3.4 mg) in hydrochloric acid (50 mM, 100 mL). An aliquot of the reaction solution was diluted with water and used as the sample solution, and then, the sample solution (250 μL), perchloric acid (4.8 M, 250 μL), and the TiP reagent (250 μL) were mixed. After 2 min, the mixture was diluted to 2.5 mL with water and used for the spectroscopic measurements. Absorbance at λ = 432 nm was measured using a Shimadzu UV-2600 UV–Vis spectrophotometer (AS). A blank solution was prepared by adding water instead of the sample solution, and its absorbance was designated as AB. The difference in absorbance was determined by the following equation: ΔA432 = AB – AS. Based on ΔA432 and the volume of the solution, the produced amount of H2O2 was determined using a calibration curve prepared in advance [31]. The H2O2 hydrogenation test was carried out as follows. The suspension containing a colloidal catalyst (10 mL) and HCl (1 M, 100 μL) were added into a glass tube. The glass tube was placed in a water bath at 15 °C, and Ar gas (10 mL/min) was bubbled through the suspension. The reaction was initiated by addition of a designated amount of H2O2 with bubbling of hydrogen gas (10 mL/min) under continuous stirring in the dark or under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm, I = 120 mW/cm2). A H2O2 decomposition test was also performed without the hydrogen gas bubbling for the H2O2 hydrogenation test. 2.6 H2-D2 exchange reactions The colloidal suspension of prepared catalyst (5 mL) was added into a glass reactor, which was placed in an oil bath at 30 °C under continuous stirring in the dark or under visible light irradiation (500 W Xe lamp (SAN-EI ELECTRIC Co., Ltd., XEF-501S) with a 420 nm long-pass filter) [25,32]. A mixed gas containing H2 gas (1 mL/min), deuterium (D2) gas (1 mL/min), and Ar gas (4 mL/min) was bubbled through the suspension. To analyze the HD production rate, the outlet gas was examined by gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-2014 instrument) with He as the carrier gas and a Shinwa OGO–SP column held at −196 °C, in conjunction with a thermal conductivity detector [33,34]. All results were deducted of a background HD measured using pure water instead of the colloidal suspension. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis and characterization of PdNPs/Au@rGO The colloidal catalysts of Pd NPs supported on rGO-coated Au NRs (PdNPs/Au@rGO) were synthesized by a bottom-up method. In this nanocomposite structure, the SPR of Au nanorods is excited by a wide range of visible light because of the anisotropic structure, and hot-electrons concentrated at the ends of the long axis can be efficiently utilized for the catalytic reaction promotion [22,35]. In addition, the contacted rGO layer contributes to efficient transportation of hot-electrons from the surface of Au NRs to the Pd active sites [28]. First, graphene oxide (GO)-coated Au nanorods (Au@GO) were prepared based on our recently reported method [28]. The size of GO, synthesized by a modified Hummer’s method [36], was reduced through sonication and filtration to yield the nanosized GO suspension [29]. Then, colloidal Au NRs (Fig. 1 A; 25 nm diameter, 75 nm length, aspect ratio = 3) and the prepared nanosized GO suspension were mixed to yield Au@GO. The homogeneous coating of the GO layer on the Au NR surface was confirmed in the TEM image (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. S1, the surface charge of Au NRs was positive (zeta protentional = 39.0). In contrast, the surface of the nanosized GO was negatively charged (zeta protentional = −29.0), owing to the carboxylic acid and phenolic hydroxy groups on the surface of GO. Since Au NRs and the nanosized GO were oppositely charged, there should be an interaction between Au NRs and the nanosized GO. In addition, the zeta potential of Au@GO was 29.4, which was between that of Au NRs and the nanosized GO, indicating the formation of the nanocomposite material due to the electrostatic interaction. In the next step, Na2PdCl4 aqueous solution was added to the Au@GO colloidal suspension (denoted as Pd2+/Au@GO), and hydrogen gas was bubbled through the suspension at 50 °C to form Pd NPs on the layer. At the same time, the GO layer was partially reduced, and the final product of PdNPs/Au@rGO was obtained. Fig. 1C and D present TEM images of PdNPs/Au@rGO, where Pd NPs (circled in Fig. 1D) with a mean diameter of 4.2 nm having a narrow size distribution are observed on the rGO layer. It is noted that the size distribution of NPs was analyzed using multiple STEM and TEM images with a wider range (Fig. S2). Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and corresponding EDX elemental mapping images (Fig. 2 ) reveal that the Au NRs are homogeneously surrounded by the rGO layer, and the NPs deposited on the rGO layer consist of Pd species (see also EDX spectra in Fig. S3). TEM images of the reference catalysts of PdNPs/Au and PdNPs/GO are shown in Fig. 1E and F, respectively. In contrast to PdNPs/Au@rGO, the Pd species in PdNPs/Au were randomly aggregated to create large NPs with a mean diameter of 6.2 nm, whose size distribution is much broader than that for PdNPs/Au@rGO (see Fig. 1C). In addition, the TEM image of PdNPs/rGO showed NPs having a mean diameter of 6.7 nm with a narrow size distribution on the rGO surface. Since the pristine, not exfoliated, GO was utilized as a support for PdNPs/rGO, the NP size of PdNPs/rGO was larger than that of PdNPs/Au@rGO, but the Pd NPs on both PdNPs/rGO and PdNPs/Au@rGO were uniformly deposited. Considering these results, GO contributes to the control of the size of metal NPs, which enables the uniform formation of Pd NPs in the PdNPs/Au@rGO catalyst. Fig. 3 shows the UV–vis absorption spectra of prepared samples: colloidal Au NRs, Au@GO, Pd2+/Au@GO, and PdNPs/Au@rGO. Even after the GO layer coating, visible light absorption bands are retained at the wavelengths of 520 and 720 nm assigned to the SPR of the anisotropic Au NRs [37]. In addition, a new absorption band at around 260 nm in Au@GO indicates the presence of the GO layer. The absorption bands of Pd2+ ions in the UV region shown in Pd2+/Au@GO disappear after hydrogen treatment, which reveals the complete reduction of Pd2+ ions to the Pd NPs on the rGO layer. The formation of Pd NPs through the hydrogen treatment was also confirmed by the color change of the suspension from dark-red to black as shown in the inset of Fig. 3. X-ray absorption structure (XAFS) measurements were performed to examine the state of the Pd species. The Pd K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of all prepared samples are similar to those for Pd foil (Fig. S4A). In addition, Fourier transform extended X-ray absorption structure (EXAFS) spectra exhibit a strong peak at around 2.6 Å, assignable to Pd–Pd bonds, revealing the complete reduction of Pd2+ ions to metallic Pd NPs, consistent with the UV–vis results (Fig. S4B). The reduction of the GO layer to rGO through hydrogen treatment was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. The bands in the Raman spectra at around 1355 and 1593 cm−1 are associated with the D band and G band, respectively, and the intensity ratio (ID/IG) indicates the degree of reduction of GO; ID/IG increases along with the reduction of GO to rGO [38,39]. Fig. S5 summarizes the Raman spectra of prepared samples with the intensity ratio (ID/IG). The ID/IG of GO slightly increases to 0.99 through the sonication process (see Fig. S5a and b), and the degree of reduction in nanosized GO is maintained even after being combined with Au NRs (Fig. S5c). PdNPs/Au@rGO (Fig. S5d) presents a higher ID/IG than Au@GO, demonstrating the reduction of the GO layer to electro-conductive rGO through hydrogen treatment, along with the formation of Pd NPs. In addition, the reduction of GO was confirmed in the PdNPs/rGO synthesis (Fig. S5e). 3.2 Direct H2O2 formation from H2 and O2 The catalytic performance of the prepared samples was assessed in the direct H2O2 formation from H2 and O2. In the reaction, Pd catalyzes H2O2 formation from H2 and O2 (Eq. (1)), but at the same time, a competing reaction of H2O production also occurs (Eq. (2)). (1) H2 + O2 → H2O2 (2) H2 + 1/2O2 → H2O In addition, since H2O2 is thermodynamically unstable compared to H2O, the produced H2O2 is easily converted to H2O through both self-decomposition (Eq. (3)) and over-hydrogenation (Eq. (4)) pathways on the Pd surface. (3) H2O2 → H2O + 1/2O2 (4) H2O2 + H2 → 2H2O Therefore, the H2O2 concentration is determined from the balance of these four reactions [5,40]. Fig. 4 A shows the time course of the direct H2O2 formation using PdNPs/Au@rGO under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) and in the dark at 15 °C. H2O2 concentration first increased to 30 μmol/L in the dark, but it remained at around 25 μmol/L after 30 min of reaction, due to the reaction equilibrium between H2O2 production and decomposition. In contrast, H2O2 was promptly produced under visible light irradiation, and the H2O2 concentration was highly enhanced to around 160 μmol/L. After 4 h, the reaction was changed to the dark condition, whereupon the H2O2 concentration smoothly fell to 50 μmol/L, clearly indicating that the H2O2 formation was promoted by the assistance of light irradiation. Considering the fact that rGO-coated Au NR colloids (Au@rGO) synthesized without Pd species showed no activity in Fig. 4C, Pd NPs served as active sites for H2O2 formation in PdNPs/Au@rGO. The rGO-supported Pd NPs (PdNPs/rGO) exhibited no production enhancement under visible light irradiation, and thus, the SPR of Au NRs under visible light irradiation contributed to the improvement of H2O2 production over the Pd surface in the PdNPs/Au@rGO (Fig. 4B). It should be noted that the state of the Pd species did not change even after the reaction under both visible light and in the dark (see Fig. S4d and e). When the sample without the rGO layer (PdNPs/Au) was employed, the enhancement rate under visible light was only 1.6, which is inferior to that for PdNPs/Au@rGO (Fig. 4B). As presented in the TEM image of Fig. 1E, Pd NPs were formed randomly in irregular sizes in PdNPs/Au, and therefore, the controlled deposition of Pd species on the rGO layer in PdNPs/Au@rGO is an important factor for the SPR-driven highly efficient H2O2 production. The impact of the size of the Pd species on the catalytic activity was further investigated. As shown in Fig. 4C, the H2O2 production was enhanced as the amount of introduced Pd species increased to 7.2 wt%, whereas the sample having 9.8 wt% Pd exhibited lower activity than the sample with 7.2 wt% Pd. By comparing TEM images of the samples with different amounts of Pd species (Fig. S6A and B), the sample with higher Pd content was found to have a larger size of Pd NPs. Therefore, the H2O2 production is largely affected by the size of NPs, and the optimum size is considered to be 6.2 nm. Summarizing these results, the SPR of Au NRs can efficiently promote H2O2 formation on Pd species in the structure-controlled rGO-Au NRs supported Pd NP catalysts. 3.3 Reaction promotion mechanism in the direct H2O2 formation by surface plasmon resonance There are two possible effects of the SPR of Au NRs on the enhancement of the H2O2 production: (1) improving the activity for the H2O2 formation reaction from H2 and O2, and (2) suppressing the decomposition of produced H2O2 to H2O. To elucidate the origin of the reaction promotion in PdNPs/Au@rGO, the H2O2 decomposition rate was examined. As mentioned in the previous section, H2O2 can be converted to H2O through two pathways: self-decomposition (Eq. (3)) and over-hydrogenation (Eq. (4)). Thus, the self-decomposition test of H2O2 (Eq. (3)) was first conducted. As shown in Fig. 5 A, only a little promotion of decomposition was observed under visible light irradiation compared to that in the dark. H2O2 did not decompose without any catalyst, suggesting that the self-decomposition occurs on the Pd surface in the catalyst. On the other hand, the H2O2 decomposition under H2 bubbling was doubled under visible light irradiation, which demonstrated the promotional effect of the SPR of Au NRs on the over-hydrogenation of H2O2 to H2O (Eq. (4)) (Fig. 5B). In the over-hydrogenation pathway, firstly H2 was activated on the Pd surface, and the H2O2 was hydrogenated by the activated H2 to form H2O [11,12]. Therefore, the reaction result indicates that the H2 activation on the Pd surface was promoted by SPR of Au NRs. Here, the H2O2 formation also proceeds through the hydrogenation pathway (Eq. (1)), and thus, the acceleration of H2 activation by the assist of the SPR of Au NRs can lead to the promotion of H2O2 production. Therefore, these results not only refute the hypothesis of SPR-driven suppression of H2O2 decomposition, but also imply that the H2O2 formation reaction (Eq. (1)) is boosted by the SPR of Au NRs, because only the hydrogenation route (Eq. (4)) was accelerated under visible light irradiation among the two decomposition pathways (Eqs. (3) and (4)). To gain further insight into the reaction promotion mechanism, the rate of H2 activation was examined through the H2-D2 exchange reaction. The HD production rate was measured with H2 and D2 gases bubbling through the suspension containing PdNPs/Au@rGO under visible light irradiation and in the dark. Fig. 6 exhibits the time course of the HD production rate, showing a significant activity increase under visible light irradiation. The catalyst without Pd NPs (Au@rGO) provides no catalytic performance for the H2-D2 exchange reaction even under light irradiation. Therefore, Pd species act as the active sites in PdNPs/Au@rGO, and the reaction acceleration is driven by the SPR of Au NRs. Previous reports also demonstrated the SPR-mediated H2 activation over Au NPs supported on SiO2, where hot electrons generated by the SPR induced the H2 dissociation on Au NPs [25,26]. In addition, we previously reported that the rGO layer functioned as a hot-electron mediator between plasmonic Au NRs and catalytically active Pd species [28]. Based on these studies, the hot electrons produced by the SPR in Au NRs are transferred to the Pd NPs via the rGO layer in PdNPs/Au@rGO, promoting H2 activation on the Pd surface. Since the H2 activation ability directly relates to the H2O2 production performance (Eq. (1)), the SPR-enhanced H2 activation leads to the large H2O2 production of PdNPs/Au@rGO under visible light irradiation. 4 Conclusion In conclusion, a large SPR-mediated acceleration of H2O2 synthesis from H2 and O2 was obtained using the structure-controlled Pd-rGO-Au catalytic system. The synthesized nanocomposite catalyst was composed of the Au NR core and a rGO shell supporting the uniform Pd NPs with a mean diameter of 6.2 nm, which provided 3.5 times higher H2O2 production under visible light irradiation than in the dark after 30 min of reaction. The SPR of Au NRs drives the H2 activation over the Pd NP surface, which leads to the promotion of H2O2 formation. This study is the first example of SPR-enhanced H2O2 production, and provides valuable insights into the design and application of plasmonic nanocomposite catalysts.

        "dc:description": "A promotional effect of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) on direct hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) formation from H2 and O2 over a structure-controlled Pd-Au catalytic system is reported herein. Pd NPs supported on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) layer-coated Au nanorod (NR) nanocomposite catalysts were synthesized, and the structure was confirmed by multiple characterization techniques. H2O2 production is highly enhanced under visible light irradiation in the direct H2O2 formation from H2 and O2. The H2O2 decomposition test and the H2-D2 exchange reaction reveal that the SPR of Au NRs facilitates H2 activation on the Pd NP surface, leading to efficient H2O2 production. Furthermore, the rGO layer not only functions as an electron mediator in the catalytic reaction, but also contributes to the control of Pd NP sizes in the catalyst synthesis.",
