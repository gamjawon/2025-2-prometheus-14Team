DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(10)60174-X Nitrous Oxide Decomposition over Alkali-Promoted Magnesium Cobaltite Catalysts Bahaa M. ABU-ZIED* Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Assiut University, 71516 Assiut, Egypt Abstract: The direct decomposition of N 2 O was investigated over a series of magnesium cobaltite catalysts, Mg x Co 1-x Co 2 O 4 (0.0 Â” x Â” 1.0), which were prepared by the thermal decomposition of stoichiometric amounts of magnesium hydroxide and cobalt acetate. The thermal genesis of the different catalysts from their precursors was explored using thermogravimetric analysis, differential thermal analysis, and X-ray diffraction. Texture analysis was carried out using N 2 adsorption at â€“196 Â°C. We found that all the catalysts that were calcined at 500 Â°C have a spinel structure. N 2 O decomposition activity was found to increase with an increase in the spinel structureâ€™s magnesium content. The influence of alkali cation promoters (Li, Na, K, and Cs) on the activity of the most active catalyst in the Mg x Co 1-x Co 2 O 4 series, i.e. MgCo 2 O 4 , was also investigated. The sequence of the promotional effect was found to be: un-promoted < Li < Na < Cs < K-promoted catalyst. The reason for the increase in activity for the added alkali cations was electronic in nature. Additionally, the dependence of the activity on the K/Co ratio was also determined. The highest activity was obtained for the catalyst with a K/Co ratio of 0.05. A continuous decrease in activity was obtained for higher K/Co ratios. This decrease in activity was attributed to the elimination of mesoporosity in the catalysts with K/Co ratios > 0.05, based on N 2 adsorption and scanning electron microscopy results. Key words: nitrous oxide; cobalt oxide; magnesium cobaltite; spinel; alkali promotion Nitrous oxide is a dangerous environmental pollutant be- cause of its high greenhouse potential and its ozone-depleting property [1]. The Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Con- vention on Climate Change (December 1997) cites N 2 O as a second non-CO 2 greenhouse gas. N 2 O has an atmospheric lifetime of more than a century and its global warming poten- tial (GWP) is 310 times higher than that of CO 2 [2]. N 2 O emissions come from natural sources and human activity such as the production of chemicals (adipic acid, nitric acid, acry- lonitrile, nylon, caprolactame), combustion processes, road vehicles, and medical exhausts etc. A catalytic process seems to be an attractive way to solve this environmental problem. N 2 O decomposition into nitrogen and oxygen has been thoroughly studied over various catalysts [3â€“9]. Metal cobaltites belong to a class of complex oxides referred to as spinels and they have a composition of AB 2 O 4 where the A ions are generally bivalent metal ions that occupy tetrahedral sites and B ions are trivalent ions that occupy octahedral sites. Cobaltites have attracted much attention from chemists be- cause of their application in low cost fuel cell electrodes [10] and as anodes for Li-ion batteries [11]. As catalysts, they have well-established catalytic properties in many reactions such as ammonia oxidation [12], carbon monoxide oxidation [13,14], methanol decomposition [15], benzene oxidation [16], con- version of synthesis gas to light olefins [17], total oxidation of propane [18], methane combustion [19], and hydrogen perox- ide decomposition [20]. The activity of the cobalt containing spinels towards the direct decomposition of nitrous oxide was found to be good and that under selective catalytic reduction (SCR) conditions was good as well [8,21â€“33]. These reports demonstrate that catalyst activity mainly depends on the preparation methods, heat treatment, oxidation state, location of the cations (tetrahedral or octahedral sites), and the presence of promoters. MgCo 2 O 4 showed the best performance among a series of transition metal spinels (cobaltites, chromites, and ferrites) during N 2 O decomposition in the absence and pres- ence of oxygen [21]. Earlier published work for the interaction of CO with N 2 O over MCo 2 O 4 (M = Cu, Co, Ni) catalysts Bahaa M. ABU-ZIED et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 264â€“272 revealed that the activity is affected by the degree of Co 2+ substitution as well as the degree of spinel inversion [22]. Yan et al. [23,24] investigated N 2 O decomposition over a series of M x Co 1-x Co 2 O 4 (M = Mg, Ni, Zn, x = 0.0â€“0.99) spinel catalysts that they prepared by co-precipitation. Their results revealed that the catalytic activity depended on the degree of Co 2+ sub- stitution by Mg 2+ , Ni 2+ , or Zn 2+ . The highest activities were observed for the Mg 0.54 Co 0.46 Co 2 O 4 , Ni 0.74 Co 0.26 Co 2 O 4 , and Zn 0.36 Co 0.64 Co 2 O 4 compositions. More recent literature reports about the promotion of N 2 O decomposition over Co 3 O 4 spinel oxide revealed other par- ticularly important contributions. Xue et al. [25] found that ceria-doped Co 3 O 4 spinel oxide had a beneficial effect. Com- plete N 2 O conversion below 400 Â°C was observed for the catalyst with a Ce/Co molar ratio of 0.05. These authors sug- gest that CeO 2 promotes the reduction of Co 3+ to Co 2+ by fa- cilitating the desorption of adsorbed oxygen species, which is the rate-determining step for N 2 O decomposition. The same research group reported further activity enhancement for their Co 3 O 4 -CeO 2 (Ce/Co = 0.05) catalyst and this was due to the presence of residual K ions [26]. The role of alkali metal cations in the improvement of N 2 O decomposition by Co 3 O 4 spinel oxide catalysts has been reported by many authors [8,27â€“29]. Potassium and cesium are superior to lithium and sodium in enhancing the N 2 O decomposition activity [27] whereas the optimum M/Co doping level is 0.01â€“0.02 and 0.05â€“0.1 for potassium and cesium, respectively [28,29]. On the other hand, doping with alkaline earth cations has also been reported to promote N 2 O decomposition over Co 3 O 4 whereas strontium and barium-doped catalysts show the highest activity [8,33]. As an extension of this interesting literature data our inves- tigation represents a systematic study for the preparation, characterization, and comparison of the direct N 2 O decompo- sition activity of a group of magnesium cobaltite catalysts with a general formula of Mg x Co 1-x Co 2 O 4 (0.0 Â” x Â”1.0). For the most active catalyst, MgCo 2 O 4 , the effect of alkali element (Li, Na, K and Cs) doping on the increase in catalytic activity is also reported. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation Mg x Co 1-x Co 2 O 4 (0.0 Â” x Â”1.0) catalysts were prepared by aqueous solution impregnation. For each parent mixture, the required amounts of cobalt acetate and magnesium hydroxide were weighed to the nearest milligram. A solution of cobalt acetate was added to the magnesium hydroxide with constant stirring. The obtained mixtures were dried at 90 Â°C overnight. Finally, based on the thermal analysis results (vide infra), the parent mixtures were calcined in air at 500 Â°C for 3 h and then cooled to room temperature. Pure Co 3 O 4 , i.e. x = 0.0, was prepared by the calcination of cobalt acetate at 500 Â°C for 3 h. Alkali-doped catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of MgCo 2 O 4 with alkali carbonates (Li 2 CO 3 , Na 2 CO 3 , K 2 CO 3 , and Cs 2 CO 3 ). The alkali metal/cobalt ratio was adjusted to 0.05. The obtained mixtures were dried at 90 Â°C overnight and then calcined at 500 Â°C for 3 h in a static air atmosphere. 1.2 Catalyst characterization Simultaneous thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and dif- ferential thermal analysis (DTA) curves were recorded using a Shimadzu DT-60 apparatus at a heating rate of 10 Â°C/min in air. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the calcined samples were recorded with a Philips diffractometer (type PW 103/00) using Cu K Ä® radiation at room temperature and the other instrumental settings were 35 kV and 20 mA. Scanning electron micro- graphs were obtained using a JEOL JSM-5400 LV scanning electron microscope (SEM). Adsorption-desorption isotherms of nitrogen (at â€“196 ÂºC) were obtained using a Quantachrome (Nova 3200 series) multi-gas adsorption apparatus. Specific surface areas were calculated from these isotherms by applying the BET equation. S t values were calculated using the V a-t plots of de Bore and the corresponding pore size distribution curves were constructed using the BJH method [34]. 1.3 Activity measurements Nitrous oxide decomposition was carried out in an electri- cally heated quartz tube reactor. The temperature in the reactor was measured using a thermocouple adjacent to the catalyst bed. Before each experiment 0.5 g of the catalyst was treated in N 2 at 500 Â°C for 1 h. The desired concentration of N 2 O was added with the aid of thermal mass flow controllers (AAL- BORG, DFC2600) using N 2 as the balance gas. The volume flow rate was 200 cm 3 /min (NTP). In all experiments, the N 2 O reactor inlet concentration was 500 ppm. Quantitative analyses of the reactorâ€™s inlet and outlet gases were carried out using a magnetic oxygen analyzer (ABB, AO2020-Magnos 106) and a non-dispersive infrared analyzer for N 2 O and NO (ABB, AO2020-Uras 14). Preliminary experiments for the decompo- sition of nitrous oxide over all the catalysts showed the absence of NO in the exit gas. Nitrous oxide conversion was calculated using the formula [N 2 O] conv. = ([N 2 O] in Ã­ [N 2 O] out )/[N 2 O] in . 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Catalyst characterization 2.1.1 TGA and DTA analyses The TGA and DTA thermograms obtained for the MgCo 2 O 4 parent mixture are shown in Fig. 1. Several weight loss proc- Bahaa M. ABU-ZIED et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 264â€“272 esses were observed upon heating the mixture to 1000 Â°C. From ambient until around 200 Â°C three consecutive steps are present at around 79, 114, and 153 Â°C (DTG). These thermal events are endothermic in nature (Fig. 1(b)). These early weight loss steps are attributed to the dehydration of cobalt acetate [35,36]. Heating the parent up to 400 Â°C is accompa- nied by a complex series of overlapping decomposition proc- esses. It has been reported that the decomposition of anhydrous cobalt acetate takes place at 200â€“400 Â°C by the formation of three intermediates (hydroxy-acetate, oxy-acetate, and car- bonate) eventually leading to the formation of Co 3 O 4 (in air), CoO (in N 2 ), and Co (in H 2 ) [35,36]. In addition, it has been reported that magnesium hydroxide decomposes to magnesium oxide at around 365 Â°C [37]. Therefore, it is plausible to relate the observed weight loss processes at 200â€“400 Â°C to the decomposition of anhydrous cobalt acetate and of magnesium hydroxide. Within the same temperature range the DTA thermogram contains a sharp exo- thermic peak with a maximum at 363 Â°C. Two interesting points could be raised for this. First, upon heating a physical mixture of Mg(OH) 2 and Co 3 O 4 from ambient to 700 Â°C the obtained DTA thermogram (Fig. 2) has two endothermic peaks at 99 and 352 Â°C. The first one could be related to the removal of adsorbed water whereas the second one may be the de- composition of Mg(OH) 2 and the solid state interaction be- tween magnesium and cobalt oxides. Second, the reported work for the decomposition of anhydrous cobalt acetate indi- cates that this salt decomposes endothermically and exother- mically in nitrogen and air atmospheres, respectively [35]. Therefore, it is plausible to relate the sharp exothermic peak at 363 Â°C (Fig. 1(a)) to the superposition of: (i) the combustion of the evolved gases accompanying the decomposition of co- balt acetate (exothermic), (ii) the decomposition of magnesium hydroxide as well as the solid state reaction between magne- sium and cobalt oxides (endothermic). The final weight loss step in Fig. 1(a), which covers a wide temperature range from 600â€“950 Â°C can be attributed to the decomposition of magne- sium cobaltite according to: MgCo 2 O 4 Äº MgO + 2CoO + Â½ O 2 (1) In other words, this step is related to the thermal reduction of Co 3+ to Co 2+ . A similar observation was reported for Co 3 O 4 and Cu x Co 3-x O 4 [38]. The DTA thermogram (Fig. 1(b)) shows that this thermal event is endothermic in nature. Interestingly, the cooling curve (Fig. 1(a)) reveals that this step is reversible. Therefore, the observed weight gain upon cooling could plau- sibly be explained by the following reaction: 3CoO + Â½ O 2 Äº Co 3 O 4 (2) This is confirmed by an XRD analysis of the two samples that were calcined at 750 and 1000 Â°C (not shown), which indicates the coexistence of only MgO and Co 3 O 4 phases in the obtained diffractograms. 2.1.2 XRD analysis Based on the thermal analysis, different Mg x Co 1-x Co 2 O 4 catalysts were prepared by calcination for 3 h in static air at 500 Â°C and these compositions depended on their corresponding parent mixtures. Figure 3 shows XRD patterns of the obtained catalysts. Based on the diffraction peaks present all the cata- lysts had a good crystalline cobalt spinel structure (JCPDS 78-1970) and no other phases were detected. This suggests that Mg 2+ ions replaced the Co 2+ ions in the cobalt oxide spinel, Co 3 O 4 , giving corresponding Mg x Co 1-x Co 2 O 4 spinel oxides. The crystallite sizes of the different catalysts were calculated 200 400 600 800 1000 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 700 800 900 40 41 42 43 44 363 81 155 322 e n d o . m D T A o e x o .

ABU-ZIED et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 264â€“272 using the Scherrer equation [4]. The calculated values are listed in the Table 1. It is evident that the magnesium containing spinels have smaller crystallite sizes than the Co 3 O 4 spinel oxide. Additionally, an increase in the magnesium content of the catalyst is accompanied by a continuous decrease in the crystallite size. 2.2 Catalytic activity measurements 2.2.1 N 2 O decomposition over the Mg x Co 1-x Co 2 O 4 catalysts Figure 4 shows the dependence of the steady-state conver- sion of N 2 O on the reactor temperature for the Mg x Co 1-x Co 2 O 4 catalysts calcined at 500 Â°C. This figure reveals that the reac- tion over Co 3 O 4 starts at 250 Â°C and this becomes lower for the magnesium containing catalysts. The temperature dependence of the N 2 O conversion is the same for all the catalysts. Furthermore, increasing the x value leads to a continuous increase in the N 2 O conversion and a maximum value of 67% was obtained over MgCo 2 O 4 at 500 Â°C. Two points could be raised in this respect. (i) The trend of activity variation with the x value is different as reported by Yan et al. [23] who studied N 2 O decomposition over a series of Mg x Co 1-x Co 2 O 4 catalysts. They prepared the catalysts by co-precipitation using K 2 CO 3 and observed the highest activity for the catalyst with an x value of 0.54. (ii) Our obtained con- version values are lower than those reported by this research group [23]. This catalytic activity difference can be attributed to the difference in the preparation method used or to the cal- cination conditions (vide infra). The mechanism of the reaction between N 2 O and the cata- lysts active centers is generally thought to be a charge donation from the catalyst to the antibonding orbitals of N 2 O, which destabilizes the Nâ€“O bond and this leads to scission [3,39]. Therefore, electron charge transfer from the metal ion to the N 2 O molecule is a crucial step for N 2 O decomposition [33,39]. Electron transfer occurs from a low oxidation state metal cation, which then increases its oxidation state. The recoverability of the ion from a high to a low oxidation state is also important for the regeneration of the active centers. Accordingly, the activity of the Co 3 O 4 oxide spinel (x = 0.0) is attributed to the coexis- tence of a Co 2+ -Co 3+ ion pair because of a facile one electron transfer between these ions during N 2 O decomposition, as shown in the following mechanism [33]: N 2 O (g) + Co 2+ Äº N 2 O â€“ (ads.) Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Co 3+ (3) N 2 O â€“ (ads.) Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Co 3+ Äº N 2(g) + O â€“ (ads.) Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Co 3+ (4) â€“ (ads.) Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Co 3+ Äº Â½O 2(g) + Co 2+ (5) Dell et al. [40] correlated the N 2 O decomposition activity of a series of metallic oxides with their semi-conductivity be- havior. Based on their classification, the highest activity was observed over p-type semi-conductors whereas the lowest activity was correlated with n-type semi-conductivity. Because Co 3 O 4 is a p-type semi-conductor [33], this could be another reason for its N 2 O decomposition activity.

ABU-ZIED et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 264â€“272 500 ÂºC over the Mg x Co 1-x Co 2 O 4 catalysts are listed in Table 1. The TOF is defined as the number of moles of N 2 O per second per square meter of the catalyst. From the combination of the data presented in Fig. 4 and Table 1 the activity is shown to be directly proportional to the x value, i.e. the Mg content, on a weight basis. On the other hand it is inversely proportional based on the surface area. Xue et al. [25,26] investigated CeO 2 promoted Co 3 O 4 using various Ce/Co ratios during N 2 O de- composition. They pointed out that the increase in surface area is a very important factor in the high catalytic activity of these catalysts. The work of Chellam et al. [30] revealed that the partial substitution of Co 2+ with Mg 2+ increases the N 2 O de- composition activity on a weight basis over the Mg x Co 1-x Co 2 O 4 catalysts. On a surface area basis the catalysts containing more Co were more active. Yan et al. [23] reported that these cata- lysts, where Co 2+ was partially substituted with Mg 2+ , were more active than pure Co 3 O 4 during N 2 O decomposition and this was independent of catalyst weight or surface area. Therefore, the results presented here are in line with those of Chellamâ€™s group [30]. It seems that increasing the mole ratio of Mg/Co is important in ensuring a large surface area but Co is the more active species in determining the ultimate catalytic activity. The role of alkaline earth cations in enhancing the N 2 O de- composition over Co 3 O 4 has been reported in the literature. Ohnishi et al. [8] reported an electronic promotion effect for the Ca-, Sr-, and Ba-doped Co 3 O 4 catalysts during N 2 O decompo- sition. More recently, an electronic interaction between cobalt and strontium or barium cations has been suggested over SrCO 3 - and BaCO 3 -Co 3 O 4 catalysts [33]. This interaction produces electron-rich cobalt species having a higher electron donation ability toward N 2 O molecules, which activates N 2 O adsorption leading to its decomposition. It has also been re- ported that the presence of Mg 2+ helps N 2 O adsorption over Mg x Co 1-x Co 2 O 4 catalysts, which facilitates electron transfer from Co 2+ [30]. Figure 5 shows the DTA thermograms obtained by heating the 500 Â°C calcined Mg x Co 1-x Co 2 O 4 catalysts that have x-values of 0.00â€“1.00 in air to 1000 Â°C. For Co 3 O 4 , one sharp endothermic peak is present at 915 Â°C. This peak is attributed to the thermal reduction of Co 3+ to Co 2+ . The intro- duction of increased amounts of Mg 2+ , i.e., increasing the x-value leads to a continuous shift of this peak toward lower temperatures. For MgCo 2 O 4 the maximum of this peak is at about 815 Â°C. This peak becomes broader with an increase in the x-value, i.e., it covers a wider range of temperatures. It has been reported that the role of alkali cations in the increase of N 2 O decomposition activity is to enhance the Co 3+ Äº Co 2+ reduction for the cobalt based catalysts, i.e., the regeneration of Co 2+ ions that are required for N 2 O adsorption and subsequent decomposition [26,42]. Based on the data shown in Fig. 5, it is plausible that the role of the added Mg 2+ ions is to enhance the Co 3+ Äº Co 2+ reduction under catalytic conditions and thus increase the catalytic activity. Regarding the influence of the catalystâ€™s crystallite size, an inverse relationship has been reported for Ag crystallite size and N 2 O decomposition activity for a series of Ag/Al x Fe 2-x O 3 catalysts [4]. It has been demonstrated that the highest N 2 O decomposition activity is obtained over catalysts that have a lower Co 3 O 4 crystallite size for a series of SrCO 3 - and BaCO 3 -Co 3 O 4 catalysts [33]. Table 1 reveals that an increase in the Mg content is accompanied by a continuous decrease in catalyst crystallite size. Therefore, the increased activity of the magnesium-containing catalysts can be related to the observed decrease in their crystallite size. An additional role of magnesium can be understood upon investigating the catalystâ€™s texture. Nitrogen adsorp- tion-desorption isotherms for the Mg x Co 1-x Co 2 O 4 catalysts (not shown) were found to be type II according to IUPACâ€™s classi- fication, indicating a multilayer adsorption process [34]. The obtained hysteresis loops are nearly type H3. The obtained A BET values (Table 1) show a continuous increase with mag- nesium content, i.e., with x-value. A similar observation has been reported for the Mg x Co 1-x Co 2 O 4 prepared by co-precipitation [30]. We believe that increasing the x-value and undertaking low-temperature calcination prevents the sample from recrystallization, which is important for an in- crease in the A BET [30]. Table 1 also reveals that increasing the A BET is accompanied by a continuous decrease in the spinel crystallite size, which is in agreement with the work reported for Co 3 O 4 /CeO 2 [26]. Figure 6 shows that the pore size distribution curves of the Mg x Co 1-x Co 2 O 4 catalysts are different, as calculated by the BJH method. In addition, the adsorption parameters are listed in Table 1. Figure 6 reveals that the introduction of magnesium into Co 3 O 4 is accompanied by a dramatic textural change. For the catalysts with x = 0.5 and 0.75, mesoporosity develops as indicated by the presence of the peak at nearly the same pore diameter in the mesoporous region. With a further increase in the magnesium content another peak emerged in the vicinity of 600 650 700 750 800 850 900 950 1000 x = 0.00 x = 0.25 x = 0.50 x = 0.75 e n d o . m D T A o e x o .

ABU-ZIED et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 264â€“272 the microporous region. The calculated total pore volume and average pore diameter values increase with an increase in the magnesium content (Table 1). Having the same pore diameter indicates that increasing the A BET values (Table 1), as a result of increasing the magnesium content, results in an increase in the number of pores already present that have nearly the same shape and the same dimensions in the mesoporous region. This is also illustrated by the fact that the height of the distribution curves increase upon increasing the magnesium content. The exploratory work of PÃ©rez-RamÃ­rez et al. [41] revealed the development of mesopores as a consequence of alkali treat- ment for Fe-ZSM-5. The development of mesopores largely improved accessibility and gas transport, which in turn im- proved the N 2 O decomposition activities of their catalysts [41]. Therefore, it is plausible to suggest that the improved activity of the magnesium containing catalysts could be related to improved accessibility as a consequence of mesopore devel- opment. 2.2.2 Influence of the alkali cation promoters Many reports exist about the influence of alkali cations in the promotion of N 2 O decomposition over various catalysts [8,26â€“29,42]. However, there is a lack of information about the role of these ions over magnesium cobaltite catalysts. There- fore, this study was extended to investigate the influence of alkali modification in enhancing N 2 O decomposition over the most active catalyst of the Mg x Co 1-x Co 2 O 4 series, i.e., MgCo 2 O 4 . The obtained results are shown in Fig. 7, in which the N 2 O decomposition is plotted as a function of temperature for the MgCo 2 O 4 and alkali promoted MgCo 2 O 4 catalysts. All the alkali promoted catalysts exhibit a higher N 2 O decomposi- tion activity (T 50 values of 405, 374, 308, and 332 Â°C for the Li-, Na-, K-, and Cs-promoted catalysts, respectively) compared with that of the un-promoted MgCo 2 O 4 (T 50 = 467 Â°C). In other words, the activity order is: un-promoted < Li < Na < Cs < K. Stelmachowski et al. [27] reported the following activity order for alkali promoted Co 3 O 4 catalysts: un-promoted ~ Li << Na < K < Cs. This contradicted the results reported by Ohnishi et al. [8] who showed that Co 3 O 4 promoted by Li and Na exhibited higher N 2 O decomposition performance com- pared with K and Cs promoted catalysts. In our case it is ob- vious that the promotional effect of potassium was superior to that of the other cations. Accordingly, the influence of chang- ing the K/Co ratio was investigated. Figure 8 shows the variation of N 2 O conversion with K/Co ratio over the K/MgCo 2 O 4 catalysts from 250â€“500 Â°C. Figure 8 reveals that over the whole temperature range, K-doping even at a small ratio (K/Co = 0.0125) results in a noticeable increase in activity. A further increase in the K/Co ratio is accompanied by a continuous increase in activity until K/Co = 0.05. After this ratio a continuous decrease in activity is evident.

ABU-ZIED et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 264â€“272 all the K-doped catalysts had a higher activity compared with the un-doped MgCo 2 O 4 catalyst. Considering the pronounced enhancement upon alkali doping, the reported extraordinarily high N 2 O decomposition activity over the Mg x Co 1-x Co 2 O 4 catalysts [23], compared with that shown in Fig. 4, can be related to the presence of residual potassium ions and these cannot be avoided in the co-precipitation procedure [26]. The proposed redox mechanism of N 2 O decomposition (equations (3â€“5)) involves N 2 O adsorption on the catalyst active sites, which can be considered to be charge donation from the catalyst surface to N 2 O. Adsorbed N 2 O decomposes into nitrogen and adsorbed oxygen. Oxygen desorption is believed to be the rate determining step. It is obvious that these steps are strongly dependent on the electronic properties of the catalystâ€™s surface. Oxygen is one of the most electronegative elements and thus it forms polar bonds with other elements (with lower electronegativities). Oxygen and its partner atom in these bonds acquire negative and positive charges, respectively. It is known that alkali cations have the lowest electronegativity values among the elements of the periodic table. Therefore, when oxygen exists in the coordination sphere of one of these cations it acquires a more negative charge. In other words, and based on Sandersonâ€™s approach of the polarity of bonds they become highly basic. During N 2 O decomposition over the alkali promoted Co 3 O 4 spinel, electron donation occurs from the highly basic oxygen anions surrounding the alkali cations to the cobalt ion and this increases the electron density of the cobalt ions, which plays a vital role in enhancing N 2 O activa- tion [28,29]. Thermal analysis results of the K- and Cs-doped MgCo 2 O 4 catalysts (not shown) revealed that both K and Cs shifts the spinel decomposition step, i.e. the Co 3+ Äº Co 2+ re- duction, towards lower temperatures compared with MgCo 2 O 4 . However, the observed shift is more pronounced for K- than for Cs-containing catalysts. Therefore, it is plausible to suggest that the enhancement effect of the added alkali cations during N 2 O decomposition over the MgCo 2 O 4 catalyst is related to the enhanced redox properties induced by these cations. Cheng et al. [42], based on temperature-programmed re- duction (TPR) results, stated that doping with excess potassium (K/Co > 0.08) clearly blocked active sites, which resulted in a decrease of the catalytic activity and this shows the dependence of N 2 O conversion on the K concentration. Pasha et al. [28] investigated cesium-promoted Co 3 O 4 and related the observed decrease in activity for the catalysts with a Cs/Co > 0.05 to the Hedvall effect [43]. During catalyst preparation the alkaline cations distribute on the surface and also in the bulk of the catalysts, which decreases their activities. An analysis of the reason for the observed activity decrease at high K/Co ratios for the K-promoted MgCo 2 O 4 catalysts is of interest. Therefore, we carried out a texture analysis using SEM and N 2 adsorption. Figure 9 shows the SEM micrographs of MgCo 2 O 4 and its potassium-promoted catalysts (K/Co = 0.05 and 0.2). The morphology of the MgCo 2 O 4 sample (Fig. 9(a)) consists of a network of: (i) spherical crystallites of 0.1â€“0.44 È�m in size and (ii) irregular holes distributed among the various particles without a characteristic size or shape. This morphology re- sembles that reported for Co 3 O 4 [25]. The K/MgCo 2 O 4 (K/Co = 0.05) sample (Fig. 9(b)) possesses the same morphological features as the MgCo 2 O 4 sample but with larger grain sizes and smaller irregular holes. The micrograph of the K/MgCo 2 O 4 (K/Co = 0.2) sample (Fig. 9(c)) resembles that of the former catalyst. However, it has the smallest pores among the three catalysts. From the SEM it is plausible that the introduction of K into the MgCo 2 O 4 catalyst enhances the densification and sintering processes. This suggestion is reinforced by the results of the N 2 adsorption measurements. Adsorption-desorption isotherms of nitrogen measured on the K-promoted MgCo 2 O 4 catalysts (not shown) were found to be type II according to the IUPAC classification [34]. The corresponding textural data (not shown) reveals a noticeable gradual decrease in both A BET and V p as a result of increasing the K/Co ratio. This may suggest that effective pore blocking accompanies the increase in K content. This is supported by the observation that the closure point of the hysteresis loop does not vary dramatically with an increase in the K/Co ratio. Pore blocking should lead to a considerable decrease in the total pore volume but not the pore diameter [44]. This implies that the pores that escape blocking should retain their original (b) (c) (a) Fig. 9. SEM micrographs of MgCo 2 O 4 (a) and its K-promoted catalysts with K/Co = 0.05 (b) and K/Co = 0.2 (c) after calcination at 500 Â°C. Bahaa M. ABU-ZIED et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 264â€“272 diameters. Therefore, the results indicate that an increase in the K/Co ratio up to 0.075 is accompanied by a continuous de- crease in the average pore diameter. The catalysts with a higher K/Co ratio show a mild increase in average pore diameter. In addition to pore blocking the occurrence of pore narrowing may be inferred for an increase in the K/Co ratio. The pore size distribution curves of MgCo 2 O 4 and its K promoted catalysts (not shown) reveals that increasing the K content to K/Co = 0.05 results in a decrease in the height of the peak that char- acterizes the mesopores, i.e. the peak at 13.8 nm, together with a peak shift to higher values. At higher K/Co ratios, the peaks at 2.3 nm and higher pore diameters disappear. Therefore, in- creasing the K content in the catalyst results in the elimination of mesoporosity. From the data shown in Fig. 8 and based on the discussion in section 2.2.1 together with the information from the texture analysis, the observed activity decrease at K/Co > 0.05 can be attributed to the loss of mesoporosity. In other words, two competing effects exist upon increasing the K/Co ratio: (i) an increase in the electron donation ability of the catalyst which enhances N 2 O activation and (ii) an elimination of mesoporosity, which leads to a decrease in catalyst activity. Therefore, the catalyst with a K/Co ratio of 0.05 shows the optimal balance between these two effects. 3 Conclusions A structural analysis of a series of Mg x Co 1-x Co 2 O 4 (x = 0.0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.00) catalysts, that were prepared by the double decomposition of Mg(OH) 2 and Co(CH 3 COO) 2 Â·4H 2 O mixtures at 500 Â°C, revealed that all the catalysts have a spinel structure. The N 2 O decomposition activity of the Mg x Co 1-x Co 2 O 4 catalysts is controlled by many parameters such as the magnesium content, crystallite size, surface area, and mesoporosity. A continuous increase in activity was ob- tained by increasing the Mg-content, which is accompanied by a decrease in the crystallite size, an increase in the surface area, and the development of mesopores. A marked increase in ac- tivity was obtained upon doping the MgCo 2 O 4 with alkali cations (Li, Na, K, and Cs). The activity order that we found is: un-promoted < Li < Na < Cs < K-promoted catalyst. The in- crease in activity because of the added alkali cations is attrib- uted to an induced electron interaction, which improves the electron donation ability of the cobalt ions and this facilitates N 2 O adsorption and decomposition. Changing the K/Co ratio revealed that the maximum activity was obtained over the catalyst with a K/Co of 0.05. At higher K/Co ratios, a con- tinuous decrease in activity was observed. Considering the N 2 adsorption and SEM results, a considerable amount of sintering and a loss of mesopores occurs when K 2 CO 3 is added to MgCo 2 O 4 . The observed decrease in activity for the catalysts with K/Co > 0.05 is related to the textural modification ac- companying the increase in K 2 CO 3 .

Tel: +2-088-2412429; Fax: +2-088-2342708 The direct decomposition of N2O was investigated over a series of magnesium cobaltite catalysts, Mg x Co1-x Co2O4 (0.0 ≤ x ≤ 1.0), which were prepared by the thermal decomposition of stoichiometric amounts of magnesium hydroxide and cobalt acetate. The thermal genesis of the different catalysts from their precursors was explored using thermogravimetric analysis, differential thermal analysis, and X-ray diffraction. Texture analysis was carried out using N2 adsorption at −196 °C. We found that all the catalysts that were calcined at 500 °C have a spinel structure. N2O decomposition activity was found to increase with an increase in the spinel structure's magnesium content. The influence of alkali cation promoters (Li, Na, K, and Cs) on the activity of the most active catalyst in the Mg x Co1-x Co2O4 series, i.e. MgCo2O4, was also investigated. The sequence of the promotional effect was found to be: un-promoted < Li < Na < Cs < K-promoted catalyst. The reason for the increase in activity for the added alkali cations was electronic in nature. Additionally, the dependence of the activity on the K/Co ratio was also determined. The highest activity was obtained for the catalyst with a K/Co ratio of 0.05. A continuous decrease in activity was obtained for higher K/Co ratios. This decrease in activity was attributed to the elimination of mesoporosity in the catalysts with K/Co ratios > 0.05, based on N2 adsorption and scanning electron microscopy results. Graphical abstract N2O decomposition was studied over a series of MgxCo1-xCo2O4 (0.0 ≤ x ≤ 1.0) catalysts as well as over alkali-doped MgCo2O4 catalysts. The dependence of the activity on the K/Co ratio revealed that the catalyst with a K/Co ratio of 0.05 had the highest activity.

        "dc:description": "The direct decomposition of N2O was investigated over a series of magnesium cobaltite catalysts, Mg x Co1-x Co2O4 (0.0 ≤ x ≤ 1.0), which were prepared by the thermal decomposition of stoichiometric amounts of magnesium hydroxide and cobalt acetate. The thermal genesis of the different catalysts from their precursors was explored using thermogravimetric analysis, differential thermal analysis, and X-ray diffraction. Texture analysis was carried out using N2 adsorption at −196 °C. We found that all the catalysts that were calcined at 500 °C have a spinel structure. N2O decomposition activity was found to increase with an increase in the spinel structure's magnesium content. The influence of alkali cation promoters (Li, Na, K, and Cs) on the activity of the most active catalyst in the Mg x Co1-x Co2O4 series, i.e. MgCo2O4, was also investigated. The sequence of the promotional effect was found to be: un-promoted < Li < Na < Cs < K-promoted catalyst. The reason for the increase in activity for the added alkali cations was electronic in nature. Additionally, the dependence of the activity on the K/Co ratio was also determined. The highest activity was obtained for the catalyst with a K/Co ratio of 0.05. A continuous decrease in activity was obtained for higher K/Co ratios. This decrease in activity was attributed to the elimination of mesoporosity in the catalysts with K/Co ratios > 0.05, based on N2 adsorption and scanning electron microscopy results.",
