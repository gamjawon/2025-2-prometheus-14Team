(+33)78892583 (Received February 26, 1992; accepted September 30, 1992 ) Abstract Well defined new precursors of Cu-based catalysts were synthesised and characterized by XRD and surface area measurements (BET, N20 decomposition) after reduction at 300 C in flowing hydrogen. All the reduced catalysts - pure Cu, binary or ternary (Cu/Cr, Cu/Al, Cu/CrAl) - were selective towards ethanol dehydrogenation at 190 C while only the composite catalysts exhibited a selectivity with respect to methanol formation from C02-H2 mixtures at 300 C under a pressure of 32 atm. While both reactions showed structure insensitivity the C02 conversion involved different types of sites when compared to the ethanol dehydrogenation test. Key words: alumina; chromium; copper; dehydrogenation; ethanol; methanol synthesis; nitrous oxide titration; structure insensitivity Introduction A series of new Cu/V-Zn catalysts was recently described in the literature [ 1,2 ] , prepared from complex precursors of well-defined composition. They were tested in two gas-phase reaction-tests in the presence of H2: ethanol dehydrogenation and C02 conversion into CH30H [ 3 ] . The active centers of these catalysts were found to be the Cu metal surface atoms, and both reaction tests showed structure insensitivity with respect to the catalytic systems. Association of V and/or Zn with Cu resulted in its promotion towards the two catalyzed reactions, both for specific activities and selectivities (for methanol production) [ 1,2 ] . Chromia as well as alumina has been utilized for a long time as a promoter or support in binary copper catalysts [4-6 ] . On the basis of our previous results it seemed very interesting to prepare binary Cu/Cr and Cu/Al as well as Cu/ Cr-A1 catalysts using similar complex precursors as starting materials. In this work the relative amounts of Cu were set at a fixed value, while those of A1 and *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/93/$06.00 1993 - Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

With these preparations it is therefore possible to investigate the effect of the relative amount of Cr and A1 ions on the catalytic properties of Cu which is always present in the same atomic proportion for all the catalysts. Experimental Catalyst precursor preparation The binary Cu/Cr catalyst precursor was prepared according to the method previously described by Astier et al. [ 7 ] for Ni/Mo compounds and extended to the preparation of Ni/Cr, Cu/Mo and Cu/Cr compounds [8]. It consists in reacting a solution of ammonium bichromate with the copper tetrammine com- 0.8 U 0.4 U 0.2 0 ae E 0.8 _U z 0.4 0.2 ~ 0 a 0 0.2 0.4 0.8 0.8 1 Cr /(Cr+AI)Th. 0 Q2 0.4 0.8 0.8 1 Cr l(Cr+AI)Th.

The precipitate obtained after heating the resulting solution for about 3 h at 90 C is isomorphous to the ammonium tetranickel pentamolybdate of ideal formula [Ni4Mo502o (NH4) 3 ] 2- 2NH4 [ 4 ] . Sodium aluminate is soluble in concentrated ammonia solutions and was therefore chosen as a precursor to replace chromium by aluminium ions in the catalyst precursors. When aluminium ions are introduced, a small proportion of Na+ ions remains after washing and drying the solid. This proportion is between 0.002 and 0.006 wt.% with the exception of the Cu/(Cr 0.1-A1 0.9) v0 v C slow 20 (1 division=5 ) ss.M> C (f `~' I Pi 1. S.eBO 2 0 (1 division = 5 ) 55.~> Fig. 2.

Catal. 79 (1993) 217-228 sample in which 0.01 wt.% of sodium is detected. The chemical analysis shows that the atomic ratio Cu/ (Cr+Al) is close to 1 and that the theoretical Cr/ (Cr+Al) ratio is in very good agreement with the experimental one, as can be seen on the straight line of Fig. la. As the amount of copper is nearly constant for all the samples, the atomic N/Cu ratio is plotted as a function of the Cr/ (Cr+Al) ratio (Fig. lb). This ratio, which is 1 for the binary Cu/Cr sample, decreases linearly with the amount of aluminium for Cr/ (Cr+Al) > 0.5 and drops to a value of about 0.1 when Cr/(Cr+Al) <0.5. These results indicate that even if all the aluminium ions are precipitated, they do not replace the chromium ions in the Cu/Cr binary compound (for which the N/Cu atomic ratio is 1), as will also be shown by the XRD data described below. Pure copper is obtained from the reduction of the oxide prepared by precipitation of copper hydroxide by ammonia. Structural properties of catalyst precursors The XRD diagrams were recorded with a Siemens diffractometer (Cu/ KaA,=1.5418 A). The pattern corresponding to the binary Cu/Cr compound is identical to the one given in ref. 8 (Fig. 2, diagram a). The ternary precursors exhibit the same structures as long as the atomic Cr/(Cr+Al) ratio is comprised between 1 and 0.6 (Fig. 2, diagram b). When this ratio is < 0.5 then the solids are less well crystallized (Fig. 2, diagram c). For higher aluminium contents (Fig. 2, diagram d) and for the binary Cu/Al, the XRD lines correspond to a mixture in which it is possible to detect copper oxide (Cu0 ), copper nitrate hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide phases (Al (OH)3) (Fig. 2, diagram e). These results are in good agreement with the results of chemical analysis mentioned above. Textural properties of reduced samples Both binary and ternary catalyst precursors were reduced at 300 C by flowing H2 during 3 h for the determination of their textural properties and catalytic performances as well. Fig. 3 shows that the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K belong to those of microporous solids for both binary and ternary catalysts. Table 1 gives the BET surface areas for the whole series of catalysts as well as their Cu metallic specific areas measured by the N20 surface decomposition at 95 C [9-11 ] . These data are also represented in Fig. 4. A first glance at these data indicates that the BET areas of the ternary samples decrease linearly when the Cr contents in the catalysts increase and that their Cu metallic surfaces do not practically depend on this Cr content and thereafter on the A1 amount, too, i.e. Sc remains the same whatever the nature of the support (A1203 or Cr203). Considering the total surface areas, alumina is a much more efficient textural promoter for sample Cu/Al than N. Kanoun et al./J. Mol.

Catalytic results Catalytic ethanol dehydrogenation at 190 C The experimental conditions were as follows: Pyrex dynamic microreactor, mixtures containing 38 Torr of ethanol completed to atmospheric pressure by HZ and on-line analysis by gas chromatography. The total flow rate was 60 ml/min. The only product (the conversion was limited to 1%) detected was always acetaldehyde (selectivity 100%) with any catalyst containing Cu, while Cr203 alone was totally inactive, and pure A1203 gave only very small traces of dimethyl ether. All Cu catalysts exhibited a very rapid steady state of activity, which lasted for more than 20 h of run, independently of their compositions, N. Kanoun et al./J. Mol. Catal. 79 (1993) 217-228 223 so all the catalytic results are given at steady-state. Fig. 5 and Table 2 summarize the experimental data. The apparent activation energies were measured between 140 and 200 C. All the catalysts exhibited the same value, E8 = 22 kcal/mole, and the same preexponential factor [1 ]. The atomic rates (noted AR) are defined by the product TOF X dispersion (in % ) as proposed by Che and Bennett [ 12 ] : they represent the rate of production of a given product per unit time per mole of total metallic atoms. In terms of AC$t and TOF, pure Cu is the best catalyst, but not in terms of AC , where the introduction of Cr203 sets and maintains the TOF values at a much lower level, playing quite the same role as V in Cu/V-Zn [2] or Zr and U 200, ao 100 U Q 0l i i 0 0,2 0,4 0,8 0,8 1 Crl(Cr+AI) 1200 U 800 '\" .s eo 400 p 0 Fig. 5.

Thus chromia seems to act upon Cu as a textural promotor and a structurally detrimental one, as can be seen from the atomic rate AR values with respect to pure unsupported Cu. One may notice that both Ac, and Ac,, values are independent of the Cr/ (Cr+Al) ratios. The TOF are also constant, whatever the Cu particle sizes, indicating that the reaction is a structure insensitive one [ 14 ] . Catalytic conversion of COZ by H2 at 300 C A high-pressure, stainless-steel dynamic micro reactor operating at 32 atm and 300 C was used with a feed containing a 1/9 C02/H2 ratio (no CO). Analysis was carried out by gas chromatography. The C02 conversions were in the range of 1 up to 10% . The GHSV was 3 X 104 h-1. Methanol, methane and dimethyl ether were detected during each catalytic run. CO resulting from the reverse WGS reaction was not analyzed. All the catalysts showed a rapid steady state towards the three products mentioned above, which lasted over 20 hours, except for the binary catalyst Cu/Cr, whose activity decreased with time on stream for CH4 formation. Tables 3-5 give, respectively, the catalytic results for the formation of CH30H, CH4 and CH, -O-CH,. It is clear that pure Cu is less interesting than all its other combinations with Cr and or Al; indeed it leads to the highest selectivity in CH4 and the lowest in CH30H. The same stabilizing effect due to the promoters towards Cu in terms of TOF values is obtained here as in the case of the ethanol dehydrogenation reaction (leveling of the TOF to a mean stable value). The methanol and methane synthesis reactions can be found structure insensitive for all composite catalysts. The selectivities were calculated from the measured partial pressures of CO2, CH30H, CH3-O-CH3, CH4 while that of CO was determined by difference. It is likely that, as the Acat for CH30CH3 formation seems to increase with TABLE 3 Catalytic properties: CH30H formation at 300 C Catalysts Acet Ac TOFX103 Atomic Selectivity (g h-' kg-' (g h-' kg-' (molec/s rates (% ) (cat.))

Discussion All Cu composite catalysts indicate a fairly strong textural promotion with respect to both the BET and the Cu metallic surface areas. In particular, for binary catalysts all obtained with an atomic ratio Cu/M (M=V, Zn, Zr, Cr, Al) equal to one, these effects can be seen in Table 6, which compares the present results with others obtained previously [2,13]. In terms of increasing BET areas the ranking of the associated element in decreasing order is: A1 > Cr > Zr > V > Zn while in terms of the specific Cu metal areas this ranking is now: Cr > Zr= V > A1 > Zn. Thus Cr is the best textural promoter in order to develop a large Cu metallic specific area, this prop- 226 N. Kanoun et al./J Mol. Catal. 79 (1993) 217-228 TABLE 6 BET and Cu metal specific areas of binary catalysts Catalysts BET surface Cu metal surface (m2/g) (m2/g Cu) Cu 1 1 Cu-V 89 29 Cu-Zn 15 6.5 Cu-Zr 112 29 Cu-Cr 163 80 Cu-A1 214 14 erty is again true for the ternary Cu/Cr-A1 catalysts as already shown above in Table 1. Cr, as well as Al, exerts a strong influence on the yields of acetaldehyde coming from the dehydrogenation of ethanol, but not on the selectivity which always remains 100% . Again, Cr is a stronger beneficial textural promoter than Al, at least for two catalytic properties: the Ac,, values are always higher for the ternary catalysts than for Cu and Cu/Al systems, and the respective TOF values are decreased with respect to those pertaining to Cu and Cu/Al to a stable value provided the catalyst (binary or ternary) contains Cr even in a small amount. This behavior has also been found with V in Cu/V-Zn, see for example ref. 2. The apparent activation energies are the same for the whole series including copper alone, this equality suggests again that Cu zerovalent atoms are the active centers of all the catalysts no matter their relative compositions. These active sites are those titrated by the N20 surface decomposition reaction in good agreement with the results published by Sivaraj and Kan tarao [ 15 ] for the same dehydrogenation test. Considering the TOF values it appears that this dehydrogenation test is a facile reaction according to Boudart's classification [ 14 ] . The atomic rate [ 12 ] of pure copper is much smaller than those exhibited by all the other composite Cu catalysts (which are quite constant and independent of the Cr contents), indicating that the higher TOF, characterizing pure Cu, does not overcome its very low dispersion (see Tables 1 and 2). Nevertheless the variation of the atomic rate values quoted here are not as high as those related to copper catalysts also containing V [ 2 ] . Roughly speaking, the same trends as above can be noticed in the formation of CH30H from C02 + H2: leveling of the TOF values by introduction of Cr either to Cu alone or to Cu/Al systems and structure insensitiveness when evaluated on the same basis than for ethanol dehydrogenation. The main difference with ethanol dehydrogenation consists in the different selectivities in methanol. Tables 3 and 4 show clearly that pure copper is more a methanating catalyst than a methanol synthesis one (compare both the corresponding AC , TOF and selectivities) and it is completely inactive toward the formation of dimethyl ether (as expected). N. Kanoua et al./J. Mol. Catal. 79 (1993) 217-228 227 The best CH30H synthesis catalyst is the ternary Cu/Cr 0.1-A10.9 with the highest selectivity (58.5%) together with the greatest yield Ac (Table 3 ). Moreover, this catalyst exhibits the lowest selectivity in CO coming from the reverse WGS reaction since its total selectivity in hydrocarbon (CH,) plus oxygenates (CH30H, DME) amounts to 97.3% . The data relative to the methanation reaction of COz show again that for the composite Cu catalysts this reaction is again structure-insensitive. Fujimoto and Shikada [ 16 ] and Fujimoto and Yokota [ 17 ] have both stressed that with C02, the more thermodynamically favored reactions, i.e. hydrocarbon formation, are indeed observed on conventional Cu-Zn methanol synthesis catalysts (from CO), which is not quite obtained with our catalysts. Therefore it is interesting to put the stress on the strong kinetic selectivity control of theC02-112conversion which develops with both the binary Cu/Cr, Cu/Al and ternary composite systems depicted above. Pure copper (see Tables 3, 4 and 5), by contrast, leads to the production of CH, which is the most favored product from the thermodynamic point of view (no butane was detected in our runs). The synergy corresponding to the production of methanol in composite Cu catalysts involves the participation of atomic Cu atoms in an association with the promoters (Al and/or Cu) which cooperate in a different way towards methanol synthesis and acetaldehyde formation. Conclusions Addition of Cr, Al or both to pure Cu resulted in an improvement of its textural characteristics as well as a strong increase in yields and selectivities for both reaction tests: ethanol selective dehydrogenation into acetaldehyde and selective formation of methanol from C02-H2 feeds containing no CO. Though pure Cu is 100% selective towards acetaldehyde production it is not the case in the synthesis of methanol, where a strong increase in CH30H formation is readily noticed when Al or/and Cr is added to it. This suggests the development of a synergetic effect between Cu and the added components. Though both reaction-tests show structure-insensitivity, which indicates that only zerovalent Cu contributes the active sites in acetaldehyde formation, the situation is far from being so clear when the methanol synthesis is considered. Indeed the metallic copper atoms that are titrated by the surface decomposition of N20 belong to the active sites. Moreover these active sites appear to be located in a specific but yet unknown environment with either A1203 and/ or Cr203as it was also noticed for Cu/V-Zn catalysts [3 ] . Acknowledgements Mrs. F.

Well defined new precursors of Cu-based catalysts were synthesised and characterized by XRD and surface area measurements (BET, N2O decomposition) after reduction at 300°C in flowing hydrogen. All the reduced catalysts — pure Cu, binary or ternary (Cu/Cr, Cu/Al, Cu/CrAl) — were selective towards ethanol dehydrogenation at 190°C while only the composite catalysts exhibited a selectivity with respect to methanol formation from CO2H2 mixtures at 300°C under a pressure of 32 atm. While both reactions showed structure insensitivity the CO2 conversion involved different types of sites when compared to the ethanol dehydrogenation test.
