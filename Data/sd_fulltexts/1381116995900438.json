Pakkanen University of Joensuu, Department of Chemistry, P. O. Box 111, FIN-80101 Joensuu, Finland Received 2 February 1995; accepted 28 April 1995 Abstract Method and conditions of preparation strongly affect the hydroformylation activity of the ruthenium cluster derived Ru3(CO),2/2,2'-bipyridine/Si02 catalyst. The highest activities have been achieved with a dichloromethane impregnated catalyst. A major problem with this catalyst is poor reproducibility of the hydroformylation activity, probably due to uncontrolled formation of several supported surface species. Reproducibility can be improved by using a non-chlorinated impregnation solvent such as tetrahydrofurane. In hydroformylation, Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine/Si02 has a strong tendency to convert alkenes directly to alcohols. The limiting step in this process is the initial hydrocarbonylation of alkenes to aldehydes. Ru3(CO) lZ/2,2'bipyridine/S'OZ catalyzes the second step, hydrogenation of aldehydes to alcohols, in good yield. Use of an effective, aldehydeproducing cocatalyst such as Rh together with Ru3(CO),2/2,2'-bipyridine/Si02 allows very high alcohol yields to be achieved. The detailed surface structure of Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine/SiOz is not known, but one probable active species is oligomeric or polymeric [ { Ru (bpy) (CO) z) . Monomeric and dimeric ruthenium monobipyridines showed at most only moderate activity in hydroformylation. By contrast, [Ru(bpy) (CO)2Cl(C(O)OCH3) ] and [Ru(bpy) (CO)ZCIH] are highly active in hydrogenation of C7 aldehydes to C7 alcohols.

Introduction Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine/Si02 is active in the hydroformylation of alkenes [ 1,2] and in the water gas shift reaction [ 3-5 ] . In hydroformylation it favors the direct formation of alcohols and isomerization of linear alkenes, demonstrating its good hydrogen transfer properties. The catalytic behavior of Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine/Si02 varies markedly with the method of preparation. The highest activities have been obtained by impregnating Ru3 (CO)12 and 2,2'-bipyridine * Corresponding author. Tel.

All rights reserved SSDI1381-1169(95)00096-8 onto Si02 from dichloromethane, but reproducibility of the catalyst is then relatively poor [ 1,2] . Reproducibility can be improved by using a more easily controllable method of preparation, such as an ALE (atomic layer epitaxy) -related gas phase method [ 6 ] or pulse impregnation from THF [ 7 ] , which suggest the significant solvent effect in the catalyst preparation. In this work we studied the effect of impregnation solvent on the activity of Ru3(CO)1z/2,2'-bipyridine/Si02 in hydroformylation and in 1-heptanal hydrogenation to 1-heptanol. Monomeric and dimeric ruthenium bipyridine compounds were investigated as pos- 80 M.

Experimental Ru3 (CO) , 2 was obtained from Johnson Matthey or prepared by a literature method [ 8 ] . 2,2'-Bipyridine was purchased from Aldrich Chemicals, while [Ru(CO)3C12]2 and Rh/A1203 (5 wt% Rh) were from Johnson Matthey. The synthesis of [Ru(bpy) (CO)2C12], [Ru(bpy) (CO)2CIH], [Ru (bpy) (CO)2C1 (C(O) OCH3)], [Ru(bpy)(CO)2C1]2, [Ru(bpy) C13(NO)], [Ru2(bpy)2C15N(H20)] (Fig. 1) o I C O..C. , Cl' lu - ci A H O..C., I : N~ -C\"R O CI and [ Ru3 (bpy) (CO) to ] has been described elsewhere [ 9-11 ] .

In the case of poorly soluble compounds such as [ Ru (bpy) (CO) 2Cl ] 2, the precursor was mixed with the silica support in an organic solvent for 14-24 h.

NaOH treatments of the supported [Ru(bpy) (CO)ZCl2], [Ru(bpy) (CO)ZCl (C(O)OCH3)], [Ru(bpy)(CO)ZCIH], and [ Ru (bpy) (CO) ZCl ] 2 were likewise done under inert atmosphere. Samples were allowed to stand in 0.1 mol/1 NaOH solution overnight, after which they were washed with water and dried under vacuum. A typical hydroformylation catalysis experiment was carried out as a batch reaction in a Berghof's 100 ml autoclave with Teflon liner. 1Hexene (1 ml, 8 mmol) was transferred to the autoclave in toluene solvent (5 ml) with 0.2 ml benzene or cyclohexane as internal standard. All solvents were dried and deoxygenated before use. The total amount of supported catalyst per reaction varied between 500 and 800 mg and the total amount of metals was 0.05-0.16 mmol. With unsupported metallic catalysts, also much larger amounts of metal were tested. In all experiments the catalysts were packed into the autoclave under nitrogen atmosphere. HZ/CO (1:1) reaction gas was introduced into the autoclave to 50 bar total pressure and the reaction was carried out at 150 for 17 h. Hydrogenation of 1-heptanal to 1-heptanol was performed by using 50 bar of pure HZ or a HZ/CO mixture. Otherwise the reaction conditions were similar to those for 1-hexene hydroformylation ( 5 ml toluene, 1-1.3 ml 1-heptanal, 0.2 ml benzene or cyclohexane). Most of the hydrogenation and almost all hydroformylation products were colored. With ruthenium 2,2'-bipyridine based catalysts, the product solution was typically yellowish and it darkened with the oxygenate yield; this may indicate to leaching of the catalyst [ 2 ] . The ruthenium content of the products was not determined. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Solvent effects of Ru3(CO),zl2,2' bipyridinelSiOz catalyst In previous studies on the impregnated Ru3(CO),2/2,2'-bipyridine/Si02 catalyst we found its activity in hydroformylation to be rather poorly reproducible [ 1,2] .Reproducibility can be improved by using a more easily controllable preparation method, such as pulse impregnation [ 6 ] or an atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) related gas phase method [ 7 ] . The highest activities have nevertheless been achieved with a catalyst impregnated from CHZCIz [ 1,2], which indicates that the solvent may play an important role in the formation of the active catalyst. A characteristic feature of both the unsupported or silica supported Ru3(CO),2/2,2'-bipyridine catalyst is its tendency to favor direct formation of C7 alcohols in hydroformylation of 1-hexene. This is due to the presence of 2,2'-bipyridine [ 1,2] . The alcohol selectivity of an ruthenium catalysts can also be improved by using tertiary amine such as Et3N as cocatalysts [ 12] . A similar `amine effect' has been found for rhodium catalysts [ 13,14] . The hydroformylation activities of Ru3(CO),2/2,2'-bipyridine/Si02 catalysts impregnated from different solvents are shown in Table 1. In all impregnations a highly air-sensitive, dark blue catalyst was obtained after thermal activation. The lowest alcohol yields (3 wt% ) were obtained with CHZC12 impregnated catalysts with a ruthenium content of 0.072 mmol (Table 1). However, also the highest alcohol yields (76 wt%) were obtained with a CH2C12 impregnated catalysts (Ru content of 0.092 mmol). Still higher activities have been reported for catalysts supported on silica F-22 (maximum yield 97 wt%) [ 1,2]. IR studies have shown that more than one surface species may be formed during the impregnation, especially when chlorinated solvents such as CHZC12 are used [ 15 ] . It has been proposed that the presence of a chlorine source in impregnation may cause chlorination /oxidation of the catalyst and subsequent lowering of the activity. In a typical impregnation the catalyst is dried under vacuum before thermal activation to remove the solvent, but if drying is insufficient, residues of CHZCl22 will remain on the silica surface and chlorination of Ru3(CO),2/2,2'-bipyridine/Si02 may occur during activation. 82 M.

The product distribution is given as wt%. Chlorination is not possible in THF impregnations. According to IR studies, the formation of surface species is also more reproducible in THF impregnations, even though more than one surface species can still be formed [ 15 ] . Only moderately active catalysts with 16-37 wt% alcohol yields were obtained with THF impregnations (Table 1) . Maximum activities of these catalysts are similar to those of catalysts prepared by pulse impregnation (THF as a solvent) [ 7 ] and gas phase methods [ 6 ] . A typical feature of THF impregnations was that the solvent adsorbed strongly onto silica. In all experiments small amounts of THF were removed from the support into the hydroformylation solution even though the catalysts were dried under vacuum for several hours. Methanol was used as another non-chlorinated impregnation solvent. Activities of these catalysts were comparable to THF-impregnated catalysts (Table 1) . Although a highly active catalyst was not obtained by impregnation from THF, the use of a THF/CH2C12 mixture (20/80% v/v) gave a catalyst with good maximum alcohol yield of 63 wt%. Unfortunately, the reproducibility was as poor as with the CH2Cl2-impregnated catalysts. It is thus possible that CH2CI2 facilitates the formation of highly active surface species in addition to poorly active chlorinated/ oxidized species. High activities may arise from a single active surface species or a mixture of species. Competition in the formation of different species may be the primary reason for the variation in the hydroformylation activity, even more important than leaching [ 2 ] . When the activated catalysts (impregnated form THF or CH2C12) were allowed to stand in dichloromethane overnight, dried and tested in hydroformylation, the activity was in most cases reduced. IR studies have shown that such CH2C12 treatment leads to an increase in the amount of chlorinated/ oxidized surface species [ 15 ] . However, the reactivity suppressing effect of CH2C12 was not systematic and not observed in all experiments. With some THF-impregnated catalysts, the activity was even slightly improved after the CH2C12 treatment. The Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine/Si02 catalyst has a clear tendency to isomerize olefins [ 1,2] . Thus the dominating side reaction with all Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine/Si02 catalysts was M.

The product distribution is given as wt%. an isomerization of 1-hexene, mostly to trans-2hexene. Another common feature for all tested Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine/Si02 catalysts was the change in stereospecificity with increasing activity. The n/i ratio of the alcohols was typically high with poorly active catalysts and decreased with increasing alcohol yield. In the mixture of isomerized hexenes this is due to the higher reactivity of 1-hexene than of internal or branched hexenes. Poorly active catalysts are only able to hydroformylate 1-hexene and leave the other isomers intact [ 16 ] . The Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine/Si02 catalyst is highly air sensitive, losing its dark blue color rapidly when exposed to air. Oxidation can also be detected by IR [ 15 ] . Despite the drastic color change from dark blue to brown, moderately active CHZClZ- and THF-impregnated catalysts ( original alcohol yields < 30 wt% ) did not, however, lose their catalytic activity completely even after 1-5 days exposure to air. The moderate activity of an air-treated, oxidized catalyst supports the assumption that a complex mixture of surface species is formed on the silica during impregnation.

Activity of Ru, Co, and Rh reference catalysts in hydroformylation Metallic Co, Rh and Ru catalyst were used as reference catalysts in hydroformylation ( Table 2 ) . Unsupported metallic Co and silica supported Cot ( CO ) 8 behaved very similarly, yielding mainly aldehydes. This is in good agreement with the activities reported for unsupported CoZ ( CO ) g and CoC12 ~ 6H20 [ 12 ] . No amine effect has been observed with these unsupported cobalt catalysts. Similarly, addition of 2,2'-bipyridine as a cocatalyst with metallic Co did not change the product distribution. Alumina supported metallic Rh gave somewhat higher yields of C7 alcohols than Co catalysts, but again the main products were C7 aldehydes, as is expected for rhodium catalysts without amine-based cocatalyst [ 16] .

As seen in Table 2, unsupported metallic ruthenium and Ru/bpy behaved very similarly to RuC13-3H20 [ 12] , showing no activity in the hydroformylation of 1-hexene. [ { Ru (CO) 3 C12}2] /Si02 was only slightly active and had a strong tendency to effect isomerization. Addition of 2,2'-bipyridine inactivated the catalyst completely. A cluster derived unsupported [ Ru3 (bpy) (CO) to ] showed moderate activity, but unlike Ru3 (CO )12 /bpy, the main hydroformylation products were aldehydes. Silica supported [Ru3(CO) lo(bpy) ] yielded mainly alcohols as a hydroformylation product, indicating a clear support effect. However, the activity remained moderate. 3.3. Activity of silica supported mononuclear ruthenium monobipyridines in hydroformylation Schematic structures of the ruthenium monobipyridines tested are shown in Fig. 1. [Ru(bpy) (CO)2C12] is found to be relatively stable [ 9] ; it is dechlorinated only slightly under H2/ CO pressure at 150, yielding dimeric [Ru(bpy)(CO)2C1]2. It is also rather stable against chlorination even in concentrated HCl [ 10] . As expected, the yellow or orange-yellow [Ru(bpy) (CO) 2C12] /Si02 showed no activity in hydroformylation (Table 3) . Even isomerization was negligible with this compound. Impregnation from THF instead of CH2C12 made no difference. Similarly, a thermal treatment had no effect on the activity. [Ru(bpy) (CO)2CIH] is more reactive than [ Ru(bpy) (CO) 2C12] ; it is converted rather easily to dimeric [Ru(bpy)(CO)2C1]2, and also reacts with CH2C12 converting in part to [Ru(bpy)(CO)202] [9].Becauseofthereactivity of [ Ru (bpy) (CO) 2CIH ] with chlorine sources, we carried out impregnations only from THF. Impregnation yielded a gray product and no change in color occurred during thermal treatment at 100. [Ru(bpy)(CO)2CIH]/Si02showedno appreciable activity in hydroformylation, but as M. Haukka et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 102 (1995) 79-92 compared to [Ru(bpy) (CO) 2C12] /Si02 it was effective in the isomerization of 1-hexene (most favorable isomer, trans-2-hexene). This behavior is not a surprising since a hydride intermediate has been proposed to be included in the isomerization reaction pathway catalyzed by metal carbonyls [17]. Yellow [Ru(bpy) (CO)2C1(C(O)OCH3) ] / Si02 was clearly the best catalyst among the mononuclear compounds, giving moderate aldehyde yields (Table 3) . The same moderate activity has been obtained for unsupported [ Ru (bpy ) (CO)2C1(C(O)OCH3)] [18].IRstudiesonsupported [Ru(bpy) (CO)2 Cl(C(O)OCH3)] suggested that the methoxycarbonyl group is lost during impregnation, which should lead to a similar surface structure than supported [Ru(bpy)(CO)2CIH] [15].However,inadsorptions of both [Ru(bpy) (CO)2CIH] and [Ru(bpy)(CO)2C1(C(O)OCH3)] onto Si02 alternative routes are possible. The adsorption may be merely physisorption, or the chlorine ligand may also be replaced by a surface bond. According to IR studies physisorption is dominating for all monomers [Ru(bpy) (CO)2C12] / Si02, [Ru(bpy) (CO) 2C1(C(O)OCH3) ] /Si02, and [Ru(bpy) (CO)2CIH] /Si02 [ 15]. Such behavior explains the difference in activities between monomers. Unlike Ru3(CO),2/2,2'bipyridine/Si02 [Ru(bpy) (CO)2 Cl(C(O) OCH3) ] /Si02 favored the formation of aldehydes, especially when it was impregnated from CH2Cl2. Impregnation from THF improved the alcohol yield. In the case of [ Ru (bpy) (CO) 2CIH ] , a slight support effect was also found. While unsupported [ Ru (bpy) (CO) 2CIH ] produces aldehydes with low yield, supported complex favors alcohols (Table 3) . Behavior of both [ Ru (bpy) (CO) 2 Cl(C(O) OCH3) ] and [Ru(bpy) (CO)2CIH] is due to co-existence of several supported surface complexes, which is affected by the impregnation solvent [15]. [Ru(bpy) (CO)2C1]2, [Ru(bpy) C13(NO)], and [Ru2(bpy)2C15N(H20) ] were practically insoluble in CH2C12 or THF and therefore were 85 not supported onto Si02. Because all three complexes are quite stable, they were expected to be only poorly active in hydroformylation. [Ru(bpy)Cl3(NO) ] proved to be almost totally inactive; only a slight isomerization of 1hexene occurred (Table 2) . [ Rue (bpy) 2 C15N (H,O) ] showed some activity in isomerization, although the variations between experiments were considerable. Aldehyde and alcohol yields were typically very low. [Ru(bpy)(CO)2Cl]2 was clearly able to isomerize 1-hexene, but it was virtually inactive in hydroformylation. Only aldehydes were produced, and in very low yield. 3.4. Activity of NaOH-treated supported ruthenium monobipyridines in hydroformylation The dark blue color of Ru3 (CO) , 2 / 2,2'-bipyridine/SiO., was not achieved by supporting mononuclear ruthenium monobipyridines. Through electrochemical reduction [ 19,20] however, [ Ru (bpy) (CO) 2C12 ] can be dechlorinated to Polymeric [ { Ru (bpy) (CO) 2 } , a dark blue polymer that is highly air sensitive and active in the electrochemical reduction of C02. The physical properties of the polymer are thus similar to those of Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine/Si02. Furthermore, Ru3(CO),2/2,2'-bipyridine/Si02 catalyst is highly active in the water gas shift reaction [ 35 ] , which is closely related to C02 reduction. Since electrochemical methods are not suitable for supported complexes, we tested the NaOH treatment [ 15 ] for the dechlorination of silica supported [Ru(bpy)(CO)2C12], [Ru(bpy) (CO)2 Cl(C(O)OCH3)], [Ru (bpy) (CO)2CIH], and [Ru(bpy) (CO)2C1],. The blue or bluish black color was obtained in all experiments and the preliminary activity tests in WGSR showed considerable activity. The IR spectra of NaOH treated products closely resembled those of the activated Ru3(CO),2/2,2'-bipyridine/Si02 [15]. Although the hydroformylation activities of NaOH-treated ruthenium monobipyridines remained at most moderate, both [Ru(bpy) (CO)2CIH] and dimeric [Ru(bpy) (CO) 2Cl ] 2 were clearly activated by the NaOH 86 M.

Even more important is that all catalysts showed very high alcohol selectivity, similarly to the Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine/ Si02. 3.5. Hydrogenation of 1-heptanal to 1-heptanol The ability of Ru3 (CO )12 / 2,2 `-bipyridine / Si02 and related monobipyridines to convert aldehydes to alcohols was tested in hydrogenation of 1-heptanal under hydrogen pressure (Table 5). With the Ru3(CO)t2/2,2'-bipyridine/Si02 catalyst the hydrogenation was practically complete. Conversion was also very high with an air treated catalyst. With use of a gas mixture (H2 /M l:l ) the activity was slightly lower but still very high. The impregnation solvent seemed to have little or no effect on hydrogenation activity. As in hydroformylation, [ Ru (bpy) (CO) 2C12 ] exhibited no activity in the hydrogenation of 1heptanal to alcohols. Conversely, although supported [Ru(bpy) (CO)2CIH] was poorly active in hydroformylation, it showed considerable hydrogenation ability. However, unsupported [ Ru (bpy) (CO) 2CIH ] showed only moderate activity, indicating a clear support effect. Supported [Ru(bpy) (CO)2Cl(C(O)OCH3) ] was also highly active in hydrogenation even though in hydroformylation it favored the formation of aldehydes. The hydrogenation activity under pure hydrogen pressure may be due to lack of carbon monoxide, the presence of which in hydroformylation may prevent the hydrogenation reaction. The hydrogenation activity of [ Ru (bpy ) (CO)2CI(C(O)OCH3)]/Si02 was strongly reduced under H2/CO-mixture (Table 5), which supported the inhibiting role of carbon monoxide. Hydrogenation properties of supported [ { RU (CO) 3CI2121 differ considerably from those of Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine/Si02 catalyst and ruthenium(mono)bipyridines. With [ {Ru (CO)3 C12 } 2] the conversion of 1-heptanal was complete, but selectivity for I-heptanol was low, the main product being n-diheptyl ether (75 wt%). With other ruthenium, cobalt and rhodium catalysts the side products were more likely long chain C14 aldol condensation products, but hardly any ndiheptyl ether was observed. Occasionally some heptanoic acid was produced as well. Addition of 2,2'-bipyridine to the [ { Ru (CO) 3C12 } 2 ] catalyst reduced the conversion of 1-heptanal considerably and prevented the formation of n-diheptyl ether completely, directing the reaction towards other long chain products. Another side reaction with supported [ { Ru (CO) 3Cl2 } 2 ] was the hydrogenation of the toluene solvent to methylcyclohexane (and benzene mainly to cyclohexane). In most cases the conversion of toluene was low, but in some experiments conversions up to 40% were obtained. Variations in toluene hydrogenation indicate that the silica supported [ {Ru(CO)3CI2}2] has some ability to hydrogenate aromatic compounds. Cobalt metal and alumina supported Rh ( 5 wt%) were tested as reference compounds in 1heptanal hydrogenation. Metallic cobalt proved to M.

The product distribution is given as wt%. be only poorly active, and addition of 2,2'-bipyridine had a very little effect on the hydrogenation activity. Again, aldol condensation side products, mainly 2-pentyl-5-nonenal, were observed. The low hydrogenation activity is in agreement with the hydroformylation results, where alcohol yields were not improved by adding amines as cocatalyst (Table 2). Rh/A1203 (5 wt% Rh) was more effective in hydrogenation of 1-heptanal than was metallic cobalt, when pure hydrogen was used. However, if the reaction was carried out using the HZ/CO mixture (1:1), the conversion to 1-heptanol was strongly reduced. Addition of 2,2'-bipyridine suppressed the hydrogenation activity of Rh/A1203 in pure H2, but with use of a 1:1 HZ/CO mixture the alcohol selectivity was improved. In addition to 1-heptanal conversion, Rh/A1203 also catalyzed hydrogenation of toluene ( and benzene). An addition of amines to unsupported rhodium catalysts considerably improves the alcohol selectivity considerably in hydroformylation. By contrast an amine addition to phosphine- or phosphite-containing rhodium compounds such as HRh ( CO ) ( PPh3 ) 3 or Rh4 ( CO ) $ (( P ( OPh ) 3 ) 4 ] has no effect on the alcohol selectivity, indicating that presence of phosphine ligands prevents the amine effect [ 12 ] . Improvement in the hydrogenation efficiency of Rh/ A1203/bpy under HZ/CO mixture may be due to 88 M. Haukka et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 102 (1995) 79-92 formation of Rh-carbonyl-amine complex, which is known to be highly active in such processes [ 12-14] . The lower activity of cobalt/bpy under HZ/CO gas mixture may also be due to the formation of metal-carbonyl-amine complex, because with cobalt such complexes do not initiate a hydrogenation of alcohols to aldehydes. The diverse behavior of Rh and Co complexes has been attributed to the different nature of M-H interactions in metal-carbonyl-amine complexes [14]. The wide variations in Co/bpy and Rh/bpy activities were partially due to nonuniform bpy deposition onto metallic cobalt or Rh/A1203. Both catalysts were prepared by impregnating bpy from dichloromethane and activating the catalyst at 100 in a sealed glass ampoule. During activation, bpy was partially adsorbed onto the glass wall instead of the carrier, so lowering the true bpy content of the catalyst. 3.6. Hydroformylation activity of combined catalysts As seen in Table 5, the Ru3 (CO )12/2,2'-bipyridine/ Si02 catalyst was highly active in the hydrogenation of aldehydes with pure hydrogen or a HZ/CO mixture. In contrast to hydroformylation (see Table 2) , reproducibility of the hydrogenation is reasonably good. Thus the major hurdle in hydroformylation with Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine/Si02 catalyst seems to be hydrocarbonylation, the actual hydroformylation step from alkene to aldehyde. A typical Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine/Si02 catalyst is nevertheless effective in hydrogen transfer, as indicated by the strong tendency to isomerization and a direct alcohol production (Table 2) . In hydrogenation experiments with Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine/Si02 (Table 5), only 1-heptanal was used as a substrate. Therefore, a good aldehyde-yielding catalyst, Co or Rh, was added to the Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine/ Si02 in order to ensure the production of a mixture of aldehydes in high yield. In these experiments the function of Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine/Si02 was to hydrogenate formed aldehyde mixture to alcohols (Table 6). Co2(CO)8 supported onto Si02 showed high activity and selectivity towards aldehydes (Table 2) . However, as seen in Table 6, when Ru3(CO)12 and 2,2'-bipyridine were co-impregnated with Cot (CO) g onto Si02, and when the total amount of metals in the reaction varied between 0.045 and 0.1 mmol, the combined catalyst did exhibit better alcohol selectivity than Cot (CO) 8 / Si02 alone. In fact, the activity was lower relative to that with pureC02(CO)8/SiO2 with a comparable metal content of 0.085 mmol. When the Ru content was increased to 0.072 mmol and Co content to 0.085 mmol, a slight improvement in the alcohol selectivity was achieved, indicating the activity of Ru3(CO)12/ 2,2'-bipyridine/Si02. Alcohol selectivity was also better with the Ru3(CO)12/bpy/CoC12 catalyst, although again the main products were aldehydes. The activity of Ru3(CO)12/Co2(CO)g/ 2,2'-bipyridine on A1203 was clearly lower than the activity of the corresponding silica catalyst. Furthermore, its alcohol selectivity remained very low. The results indicate a negative support effect of A1203 on the Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine catalyst. Since Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine/A1203 was practically inactive in hydroformylation (Table 1) , the activity of the alumina supported combined metal carbonyl catalyst just arise from Co2(CO)g. A mechanical mixture of separately impregnated Ru3(CO)12/bpy/Si02 and Co2(CO)g/ Si02 with total metal content of 0.09 mmol showed only a moderate hydroformylation activity yielding alcohols; isomerization was the dominating reaction (Table 6). This behavior is similar to that of an average Ru3(CO).12/2,2'bipyridine/Si02 catalyst (Ru content 0.07-0.09 mmol), indicating that Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine can be partially replaced by cobalt carbonyl catalyst without losing its alcohol selectivity. When the composition of H2/CO gas mixture was changed from 1:1 to 4:1 the alcohol selectivity became even more pronounced. All the combined Ru3(CO)12/bpy/Si02 and Co2(CO)g/Si02 cat- M.

A pure RhlAl203 catalyst gave the nli ratio of 0.3 for C7 aldehydes and 0.5 for C7 alcohols (Table 2), whereas moderately active Ru3{CO},212,2'-bipyrine/S2 favors an n/i ratio higher than 1.5. A typical n/i ratio for C7 alcohols obtained by the combined Ru/Rh catalyst was c 1.0, indicating that rhodium is mainly responsible for aldehyde formation and Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyrinelS2 for converting C7 aldehydes to alcohols. 3.7.

Effect of the preparation method on hydroformylation activity of Ru3(CO) 12/2,2'-bipyridine catalyst. Si02 depend on the method and conditions of preparation. The effect of the preparation method and the behavior of variously active Ru3(CO)12/ 2,2'-bipyridine/Si02 catalysts in 1-hexene hydroformylation are summarized in Fig. 2 and 3. An uncontrolled formation of several supported ruthenium species during impregnation reduces reproducibility of the catalyst. In impregnation the optimum Ru/bpy ratio in Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine/Si02 catalyst is found to be 1:1 [ 1,2] . The same ratio has been found for pulse impregnated catalysts where considerable excess of 2,2'-bipyridine was used during a preparation [ 15 ] . This indicates that ruthenium monobipyridines are the most probable surface species. IR studies on the Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine/Si02 catalyst have shown some similarities with monomeric ruthenium monobipyridine dicarbonyls and with polymeric [ {Ru(bpy) (CO)2)n] [ 15] . A typical oxidation number for a stable monomeric ruthenium bipyridine dicarbonyl compound is +lI (Fig. 1) and thus the formation of monomers from Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine/Si02 requires oxidation of the original ruthenium cluster. If no `free' oxidizing agents such as oxygen are available, ruthenium may be oxidized by the silica surface. As seen in Table 3, the hydroformylation activity of this type of supported monomers is at most moderate, the dominating reaction being isomerization. Despite the low hydroformylation activity, supported monomers can be highly active in the hydrogenation of heptanal (Table 5) . A similar behavior has been observed with the Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine/Si02 catalyst (Fig. 3) .

Catalytic behavior of variously active Ru3 (CO) ,2/2,2'-bipyr idine/SiOz catalysts. M. Haukka et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 102 (1995) 79-92 main products are isomers and all hydroformylation products have been converted to alcohols. Furthermore, the high n/i ratio of alcohols indicates that only the energetically more favorable hydroformylation of linear and terminal alkenes occur [ 16] . With more active catalysts also branched or internal alkenes can be converted and the n/i ratio is closer to one. The solvent effect in impregnation is clear. Use of chlorinated solvents such as CH2C12 yields both highly active and almost inactive catalysts, whereas non chlorinated solvents such as THF yields at most moderately active catalysts. The negative effect of chlorinated solvent is most probably due to chlorination of the surfaces species. A similar deactivation with increased number of chlorine ligands is observed with ruthenium monomers. [ Ru (bpy) (CO) 2CIH ] and [Ru(bpy) (CO)2Cl(C(O)OCH3) ] were active at least in hydrogenation (Table 5) , while [Ru(bpy) (CO)2C12] is inactive in both hydroformylation and hydrogenation. Further chlorinated and oxidized [ Ru (bpy) Cl3 (NO) ] and [ Ru2 (bpy) 2Cl5N (H20) ] are practically inactive (Table 2) . Reduced activity is probably due to greater stability of chlorinated complexes. Both [Ru(bpy)C13(NO)] and [Ru2 (bpy)2 C15N (H20) ] are highly stable. In fact, they can be obtained from [ Ru (bpy) (CO) 2C12 ] under drastic conditions: in concentrated HCl/HN03 solution at 240 [ 10 ] . In addition to the possible formation of monomers, another potential deactivation process of Ru3(CO)I2/2,2'-bipyridine/Si02 is decarbonylation. As seen in Table 2, metallic ruthenium and Ru/bpy are completely inactive in hydroformylation. Formation of supported metallic ruthenium during the activation does not have to be complete to cause a steep drop in the catalyst activity. This is due to the narrow optimum loading of the active Ru species 1.1-1.8 wt% [2,6,7]. In the present work, the theoretical loading usually was set to 1.5 wt%, when relatively small loss of the active component would lead to a sharp drop in activity. 91 The high hydroformylation activity, found only with CH202 impregnated Ru3(CO)12/2,2'bipyridine/Si02 catalysts [ 1,2], is more difficult to explain. Although THF directs the surface reactions more specifically than CH2C12, no highly active THF impregnated catalyst were obtained. The activity of THF impregnated and pulse impregnated catalyst [ 7 ] is similar to that of the ALE prepared catalyst [6], which indicates that THF itself is not the reason for the lack of highly active catalyst components. However, THF probably direct the reaction to similar surface species at the preparation without solvent. It is thus possible that impregnation from CH2Cl2 facilitates the formation of a highly active compound or mixture as well as poorly active species. The detailed structure of the highly active component in the Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine/Si02 catalyst still remains unclear. One possibility is oligomeric or polymeric [ (Ru (bpy) (CO) 2 } ] As discussed earlier the blue, air sensitive polymer can be prepared from [ Ru (bpy) (CO) 2C12 ] by electrochemical reduction [ 19,20]. Similar blue product can be also obtained by NaOH-treatment of [Ru (bpy) (CO)2C1(C(O)OCH3)], [Ru(bpy)(CO)2ClH], or [Ru(bpy)(CO)2C12] [ 15 ] . Although the relation between an electrochemical [ {Ru(bpy) (CO) 2} ]polymer and NaOH-treated monomers is not yet clear, it seems likely that the NaOH treatment leads, at least partially, to dechlorination and oligo- or polymerization. The preliminary studies with NaOH-treated monomers in WGSR showed comparable activities, to those achieved with the Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine/Si02 catalyst. As seen in Table 4, NaOH treatment of supported monomers and [ Ru (bpy) (CO) 2Cl ] 2 dimer activated the catalyst, even though the activity remained relatively poor. In all cases the main hydroformylation products were C7 alcohols, which is also typical for Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine/Si02. Low activities may be due to a mixture of surface species. Some unreacted monomer or dimer could remain after NaOH treatment or the polymerization of the monomers could have partially stopped at the dimeric (for example 92 M. Haukka et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 102 (1995) 79-92 [ {Ru(bpy) (CO) 20H12] ) or at some poorly active oligomeric stage [ 15 ] . Yet another possibility is severe decarbonylation, leading either to metallic ruthenium or to surface oxidized ruthenium species, both of which are expected to be very poorly active. IR studies on NaOH-treated monomers indicate that the amount of unreacted monomer is low and considerable evolution of C02 during the treatment is not observed except for [Ru(bpy) (CO) 2Cl(C(O)OCH3) ], where it is probably due to decomposition of the methoxycarbonyl group [ 15 ] . The most likely alternative, then, is that the polymerization is incomplete and that unreactive oligomeric or polymeric side products are formed. Such side products could also appear in the preparation of Ru3 (CO) 12 / 2,2'bipyridine/Si02 catalyst with the solvent having an important role in directing their formation. 4. Conclusions The Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine/Si02 catalyst is highly active in hydrogen transfer processes such as isomerization of alkenes and hydrogenation of aldehydes to alcohols. It is also highly active in the water gas shift reaction, and in the hydroformylation of alkenes where it favors the direct formation of alcohols. Method and conditions of preparation strongly influence properties of the catalyst. A major problem with impregnated Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine/Si02 in hydroformylation is poor reproducibility. This can be improved, however, by choosing a more easily controlled preparation method such as an ALErelated gas phase method or pulse impregnation. In impregnation, the choice of solvent affects the hydroformylation activity of Ru3(CO)12/2,2'bipyridine/ Si02- With use of a chlorinated solvent such as CH2C12. catalysts vary widely from highly active to very poorly active. The considerable variations in hydroformylation activity of Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine/Si02 are probably due to the co-existence of several surface species. This would explain the effects of the solvent and the preparation method of the catalyst. In the pres- ence of Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine/Si02 cata- lyst, the limiting step in the hydroformylation of alkenes directly to alcohols is alkene hydrocarbonylation. If this initial step is achieved by adding a cocatalyst such as Rh favorable to aldehyde production, alcohols can be obtained directly in good yield. The exact structure of the active surface species of Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine/Si02 is not known, but one possibility is polymeric or oligomeric [ { Ru (bpy) (CO) 2 } ] Monomeric and dimeric ruthenium monobipyridines are typically only moderately active.
