Graphical abstract Acidity- and size-controlled SAPO-34 zeolites were prepared via a hydrothermal method by controlling the type and ratio of the structure-directing agents (SDA) such as tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH) and/or morpholine (MP). The SAPO-34 catalysts were applied and tested for their ability to convert ethylene to propylene (ETP) directly. The propylene formation from ethylene showed a volcano-type trend with a crystal size of 0.3–13μm of the SAPO-34 zeolite by changing the ratio of TEAOH and MP. In addition, the propylene yield increased with an increase in the Si/(Si+P+Al) ratio from 0.042 to 0.105 and decreased at a Si/(Si+P+Al) ratio of 0.119. The results show that the proper size and acidity of the SAPO-34 catalyst with controlling the ratio of TEAOH and MP are required for an efficient ETP transformation process. The improved catalytic performance achieved while controlling the size and acidity may be related to number and strength of the active acid sites on the SAPO-34 zeolite. Keywords SAPO-34 catalyst Ethylene to propylene reaction Heterogeneous catalysis Crystal size Acidity 1 Introduction Propylene is an important raw material for the production of polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and propylene oxide [1–3]. Due to the greater levels of need for propylene derivatives such as polypropylene, the production of propylene has received much attention recently. To meet the increasing demand for propylene, several strategies, such as propane dehydrogenation and the metathesis of ethylene and 2-butene, have been developed for propylene production [4–9]. More recently, the direct conversion of ethylene to propylene (ETP) was proposed as a new process for the production of propylene [10–18]. This would be an interesting reaction process by which to produce propylene, particularly when it is combined with the industrial processes of ethane cracking to ethylene and the dehydration of ethanol/bio-ethanol to ethylene. Several types of zeolites have been studied as potential ETP catalysts [10,13,15–17]. The acidity and the pore structure of zeolites were considered as the critical factors controlling the ETP reaction [16,17]. SAPO-34 and SSZ-13 zeolites with chabazite (CHA) cages connected via 8-ring windows for application to the ETP reaction have been reported in some studies, which show levels of high ethylene conversion and propylene selectivity [10,13,15,19,20]. The high propylene selectivity with CHA zeolites is related to shape selectivity caused by the small pores of the CHA zeolite [13,16]. It has been reported that the particle size of the SAPO-34 zeolite influences the degree of propylene selectivity and the production rate for the ETP reaction and that the acid strength of SAPO-34 is independent of the Si mole fraction, having little influence therefore on the degree of propylene selectivity [15]. The SSZ-13 zeolite had relatively high propylene selectivity compared to the SAPO-34 zeolite, but the catalyst was deactivated very rapidly [10]. We recently reported that the activity and selectivity for the ETP reaction were changed by controlling the SiO2/Al2O3 ratios (silica/alumina ratios or SARs) of SSZ-13 catalysts [21]. Compared to the SSZ-13 zeolites, the SAPO-34, which is known as a methanol to olefins (MTO) catalyst, can be easily synthesized with relatively cheap templates. It also can be prepared in the wide range of crystal size and Si/(Si+P+Al) ratio. Therefore, CHA zeolite systems such as the SAPO-34 can provide a considerable amount of information to those attempting to design active and selective catalysts and to understand the reaction chemistry of the ETP reaction; however, very few studies have been devoted to direct ETP reactions using SAPO-34 zeolites. In this work, a systematic study of the ETP reaction over a small-pore SAPO-34 molecular sieve was conducted in an effort to find ways to increase the propylene yield and change the product distribution by controlling the crystal size and acidity. SAPO-34 zeolites with different crystal sizes and acidity levels were synthesized via a hydrothermal method by controlling the type and ratio of the structure-directing agent (SDA), after which they were characterized by various physicochemical analyses. The propylene yield and product distribution of other hydrocarbons were investigated when ethylene was reacted over the size- and acidity-controlled SAPO-34 catalysts. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of acidity and size-controlled SAPO-34 catalysts SAPO-34 zeolites with different crystal sizes and acidity levels were synthesized via a hydrothermal method while controlling the type and ratio of SDA. First, a gel solution was prepared with a gel molar composition of 0.3 SiO2: 1 Al2O3: 2 SDA: 1P2O5: 52H2O with fumed silica (Aerosil 380) as a silica source, aluminium isopropoxide (Samchun Corp. 98%) as an alumina source, phosphoric acid (Samchun Corp. 85%) as a phosphorous source, and tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH, Sigma-Aldrich 25%) and/or morpholine (MP, Sigma-Aldrich 99%) as the SDA. The total molar ratio of SDA (including MP and TEAOH) was fixed at 2.0. To control the crystal size and acidity of the SAPO-34, the amount of MP was varied from 0 to 2.0. Note that MP 0, MP 1.0, MP 1.3, MP 1.5, MP 1.8 and MP 2.0 mean that the molar ratio of MP:TEAOH is 0.0:2.0, 1.0:1.0, 1.3:0.7, 1.5:0.5, 1.8:0.2 and 2.0:0.0, respectively. The prepared gel solution (MP 0–MP 2.0) was stirred for 24h at room temperature. The solution was then transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave with a rotary gear oven and crystallized at 180°C for 24h. After the crystallization process, the resulting solid samples were filtered, washed and then dried in an oven at 110°C for 12h. To remove the organic SDA, a calcination process was carried out at 550°C for 6h under an air atmosphere. 2.2 Catalyst characterization The structure of the SAPO-34 catalyst was investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns using a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ=0.15406nm) at 40kV and 30mA. The crystal size and morphology were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a Tescan Mira 3 LMU FEG at 20kV with a Pt coating. The chemical composition was analyzed by an inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) using a Thermo Scientific iCAP 6500 duo. The surface area of the catalyst was determined by N2 adsorption-desorption measurements using a Micromeritics ASAP2020 analyzer. The acidity of the catalyst was measured by the temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia gas (NH3-TPD) using a BEL-CAT-B analyzer. Solid-state 27Al MAS NMR spectra were obtained on a 400MHz Avance II+ Bruker spectrometer operated at radio frequency of 104.26MHz using a 90° pulse length of 1.8μs and a cycle delay time of 3s. 2.3 ETP reaction testing The catalytic performance for the ETP reaction was tested with a 1/2” fixed-bed reactor, where 0.5g of the SAPO-34 catalyst was loaded into the reactor, with the catalyst pretreated under a flow of nitrogen at 500°C with 150 cc/min for two hours. After the pretreatment, ethylene gas was injected into the reactor and reacted at 400°C with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 0.33h−1 under ambient pressure, where the concentration of ethylene was fixed to 30mol% under a nitrogen balance. The product gas was analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (GC, Younglin Corp. model 6100) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The conversion of ethylene was calculated from the GC-TCD signal of nitrogen and ethylene. The hydrocarbon products generated from the reaction were analyzed by GC-FID. The columns used were a HP-PLOT Q (Agilent) capillary column and a Carboxen 1000 (Supelco) packed column. Conversion and selectivity were evaluated on a carbon mole basis and defined in Eqs. (1)–(2): (1) Conversion (%)=[{carbon (mol) in initial ethylene−carbon (mol) in ethylene after reaction}/{carbon (mol) in initial ethylene}] * 100 (2) Selectivity (%)=[{carbon (mol) in a product}/{carbon (mol) in all products}] * 100 Based on GC analysis of products, the carbon balance was over 92−95% for each reaction performed. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structural and chemical characterizations Fig. 1 shows XRD patterns of the SAPO-34 prepared catalysts while controlling the ratio of MP and TEAOH with a SDA. The Si/(Si+P+Al) ratio was identical at 0.130 for all starting gels. The XRD result in Fig. 1 shows that the SAPO-34 catalysts prepared by changing the MP and TEAOH ratio have typical SAPO-34 crystalline characteristics [22–24] and that the XRD peak intensity gradually increases when increasing the amount of MP. This means that the crystallinity and size of the SAPO-34 catalysts increase with an increase in the amount of MP. It has also been reported that the crystalline phase and size change when MP is used as a template agent when also using TEAOH [22,23,25]. A change in the size of SAPO-34 was also demonstrated in the SEM analysis, as shown in Fig. 2 and in Table 1 . The SEM images in Fig. 2 indicate that the crystalline size increases from 0.3μm to 13μm when controlling the MP and TEAOH ratio and when simultaneously increasing the amount of MP. The SEM analysis reveals that crystal size of the SAPO-34 is dependent on the nature and ratio of SDA used during synthesis [22,25]. It has been reported that Si atoms incorporate into the AlPO4 framework through two different mechanisms [26,27]. One is a SM2 mechanism that one isolated Si atom substitutes for P to form Si(4Al) entities. The other is a SM3 mechanism that two Si atoms substitute for neighboring Al and P to generate Si(0–3Al) structures [28,29]. It has been also suggested that Si incorporation follows SM2 mechanism at the ratio of (Si+P)/Al=1 [27]. The SM2 and SM3 mechanisms all takes place during the SAPO-34 formation at the ratio of (Si+P)/Al>1. As shown in Table 1, chemical composition results analyzed by ICP-AES demonstrate that the (Si+P)/Al ratios are more than 1 for prepared MP 1.5–MP 2.0 SAPO samples, indicating that both SM2 and SM3 substitution may occur simultaneously when increasing the MP of >1.5. It should be noted that the surface area of all of the prepared SAPO-34 catalysts was about 530–600m2/g according to the N2 sorption measurements. This confirms that size-controlled SAPO-34 catalysts with a high surface area can be prepared by changing the type and ratio of the SDA. 3.2 Measurement of acidic property The acidity of the size-controlled SAPO-34 catalyst was investigated using a NH3-TPD tool in order to determine how the acidity changes with the crystalline size. It is noteworthy that the ETP reaction proceeds over the acid sites of zeolite catalysts [13,17]. Therefore, the acidity and acid strength of the prepared SAPO-34 catalysts should be compared and analyzed with regard to the ETP reaction. Fig. 3 shows the NH3-TPD profiles of the prepared SAPO-34 zeolite catalysts when controlling the type and ratio of the SDA. The catalyst samples exhibited two distinct peaks, i.e., a lower temperature peak (<250°C) and a higher temperature peak (>250°C), both in accordance with the literature regarding the acidity of SAPO-34 materials [25,30–34]. It is also well known that lower and higher temperature peaks correspond to weaker and stronger acid sites, respectively [25,30,31]. The peak position reflects the strength of the acid sites [17,24,25]. Fig. 3 and Table 1 clearly indicate that the total acidity (the sum of the weak acidity and strong acidity) increases with an increase in the amount of MP up to 1.5 (also increasing the crystal size up to 3.2μm). The acidity shows a slight increase in the SAPO-34 samples when the amount of MP exceeds 1.5 (crystal size, >3.2μm). The intensity of the high-temperature desorption peak (appearing at>250°C) assigned to the strong acidic sites which are generated by the incorporation of Si into the framework of the SAPO molecular sieve increased with an increase in the amount of MP in the order of MP 2.0>MP 1.8>MP 1.5>MP 1.3>MP 1.0>MP 0. These results demonstrate that the amount of the acid sites change with the crystal size when controlling the MP and TEAOH ratio [23]. The high-temperature desorption peak is related to the bridging hydroxyl group (OH) as a Brønsted acid site [35]. The hydroxyl group is responsible for the catalytic process at high temperatures. The concentration of bridging hydroxyl group varies with TEAOH/MP ratio. It should be noted that the higher desorption temperature represents the stronger acid sites. From the NH3-TPD results, the acid sites of samples with more MP are stronger than those with TEAOH. This may be due to the more silicon environment into the framework. It is well known that Si incorporation into AlPO framework for SAPO-34 molecular sieves plays an important role of the acid site generation [36,37]. The Si(4Al) structures generated by each Si substituting for P alone (SM2 mechanism) can lead to negatively charged framework and relatively weaker Brönsted acid sites. The Si(0–3Al) structures with double substitution of neighboring Al and P by two Si atoms (SM3 mechanism) cause the formation of stronger acid sites [27]. The acidic strength of bridge hydroxyl species of Si(nAl) decrease in the order of Si(1Al)>Si(2Al)>Si(3Al)>Si(4Al)>Si(0Al) [37,38]. In the NH3-TPD spectra of Fig. 3, the strong desorption peaks of MP 1.5, MP 1.8, MP 1.9 and MP 2.0 at high temperature might be attributed to either the high content of Si(0–3Al) or the existence of Si islands in these SAPO-34 catalysts [28]. This is supported by ICP-AES that both SM2 and SM3 substitution may take place when increasing the MP of >1.5. The low-temperature peak intensity (appearing at<250°C), attributed to the hydroxyl groups originating from the POH, SiOH, and AlOH groups not fully linked to the AlO4 tetrahedra [22,23,25], showed a gradual increase in the peak intensity with the amount of MP. This observation is supported by the XRD results shown in Fig. 1, which exhibit a gradual increase in the XRD peak intensity for SAPO-34 with a greater amount of MP. 3.3 27Al NMR studies The Brønsted acid site creates from the bridging hydroxyl groups between Al and Si atoms, thus the environment of Al in SAPO-34 molecular sieves is also closely related to the acid property [39,40]. Fig. 4 presents the 27Al MAS NMR spectra of the synthesized SAPO-34 samples with increasing the amount of MP. The spectra of MP 0 sample shows two resonance peaks at approximately 65 and 40ppm, corresponding to tetrahedral framework aluminum [21,40–43]. In addition to these resonance peaks, the spectra of the MP 0 (MP:TEAOH=0.0:2.0) sample exhibit two additional resonance peaks at approximately 10 and −10ppm that are attributed to pentacoordinated and octahedral aluminum species, respectively [40,43]. Interestingly, the 27Al NMR spectra with increasing MP amount show significant differences in the relative intensities of the tetrahedral, pentacoordinated, and hexacoordinated aluminum signals. As the MP amount is increased from 0 to 1.8 and the crystal size is also increased from 0.3 to 9μm, an increasing fraction of aluminum is converted from pentacoordination to tetrahedral (indicated by increase in the intensity of the resonance at 40ppm and decrease in the intensity of the resonance at 10ppm). In case of the MP 2.0 (MP:TEAOH=2.0:0.0), the Al fraction is slightly returned from tetrahedral framework to pentacoordinated species. These results suggest that the difference in 27Al MAS NMR spectra of SAPO-34 with different MP contents demonstrates the different Si status in the framework, and hence the different acid property [40,43]. These NMR results are also consistent with the NH3-TPD characterization data for the SAPO-34 catalysts that suggest increasing MP amount converts pentacoordinate aluminum species to tetrahedral framework aluminum, consequently creating Brønsted acid sites and increasing acidic strength of bridge hydroxyl species of Si(nAl) (as shown in Figs. 3 and 4). 3.4 Effect of MP amount on ETP reaction To demonstrate how the SAPO-34 zeolites with increasing MP amount affect the process of the formation of propylene from ethylene, it is reasonable to compare the catalytic ETP performance capabilities of SAPO-34 catalysts with different MP content, in this case from 0.3 to 13μm. It should be noted that pore size of SAPO-34 indicating the entrance pore diameter is 0.43nm, while the kinetic diameters of the C2H4, C3H6 and C3H8 molecules are 0.39, 0.45 and 0.43, respectively [44]. Thus, it is almost the same size as the pore diameter in SAPO-34. This suggests that these molecules can easily diffuse into the zeolite pores and suggests that reactions of these molecules within the SAPO-34 are reactions within the zeolite pores. Fig. 5 shows the changes in the crystal size, total actidity and Si/(Si+P+Al) ratio of the prepared SAPO-34 catalysts according to the amount of MP and the relationships between the total acidity and the propylene yield with different sizes for the ETP reaction at 400°C. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the crystal size of SAPO-34 increases with an increase in the amount of MP. This was discussed previously in the XRD and SEM results in Figs. 1 and 2. The Si/(Si+P+Al) ratio as measured by ICP-AES increases with an increase in the amount of MP to 1.5 and becomes saturated between MP 1.8 and MP 2.0. The NH3-TPD result in Fig. 3 also shows that the total acidity increases when increasing the amount of MP from 0 to 1.5, and it slightly increases in the range of MP 1.5–MP 2.0. In Fig. 5(b), it is interesting that the maximum propylene yield shows a volcano-type trend with the crystal size and MP content. The maximum propylene yield increased with the total acidity as the crystal size of SAPO-34 increased from 0.3μm to 3.2μm. The SAPO-34 with a crystal size of 3.2μm exhibited the best ETP performance among the tested SAPO-34 catalysts. The enhanced performance of SAPO-34 (MP 1.5) at an optimum crystal size of approximately 3.2μm can be explained by the effects of both the crystal size and the acidity, as the MP 0, MP 1.0, MP 1.5 and MP 2.0 samples have an identical crystal structure with the CHA topology and similar surface areas (see Fig. 1 and Table 1) but show different crystal sizes and acidic properties (see Figs. 2–4 and Table 1). In addition, the maximum propylene yield of the SAPO-34 catalysts with a crystal size exceeding 3.2μm and increasing MP content from 1.5 to 2.0 decreased when the size increased despite the similar total acidity values. This trend may be due to the increased strength of the strong acid sites on the zeolite catalyst with the increase in the size, as shown in Figs. 3 and 5 [17,23]. 3.5 Changes of ETP conversion and product distribution In order to determine how the product distributions for the ETP reaction differ with the crystal size, the ethylene conversion and product yield with respect to the reaction time were investigated at 400°C over the prepared SAPO-34 catalysts (MP 0, MP 1.5 and MP 2.0). As shown in Fig. 6 (a), the initial ethylene conversion increased in the order of SAPO-34 (MP 2.0)>SAPO-34 (MP 1.5)>SAPO-34 (MP 0). This can be expected given that the amount and strength of the acid sites on the SAPO-34 increased with an increase in the amount of MP. With regard to catalyst deactivation, SAPO-34 (MP 1.5) also showed excellent performance compared to the other tested catalysts. In Fig. 6(b–d), the SAPO-34 (MP 1.5) catalyst exhibits a higher propylene selectivity than the SAPO-34 (MP 1.0) and SAPO-34 (MP 2.0) catalysts. In the MP 1.5 and MP 2.0 SAPO-34 samples, the propylene yield increased, peaked and then decreased with time-on-stream due to the decreasing ethylene conversion and increasing propylene selectivity. When the MP amount increased from 0 to 2.0, the selectivity to propane was increased. This indicates that a hydrogen transfer reaction that converted propylene to propane is a major reaction on active Brønsted acid sites of the CHA zeolite [10,21]. As shown in Figs. 3 and 4 and Table 1, the total acidity increased and the environment of Al in SAPO-34 molecular sieves was changed when the size of SAPO-34 increased from 3.2μm to 13μm and also the MP amount increased 1.5 to 2.0. These results suggest that more acidity like Brønsted acid sites is needed for the ETP conversion. The NMR and ICP-AES analyses also demonstrate increasing MP amount converts pentacoordinate aluminum species to tetrahedral framework aluminum, originating Brønsted acid sites and increasing acidic strength of bridge hydroxyl species of Si(nAl). However, when the crystal size of SAPO-34 became too large, such as 13μm (MP 2.0), greater acidity levels resulted compared to those of SAPO-34 0.3μm (MP 0) and 3.2μm (MP 1.5) in size, having negative effects on the activity and stability of the ETP reaction. Thus, proper size control of the SAPO-34 catalyst with controlling MP amount is required together with the optimum acidity for an efficient ETP reaction. 3.6 Acidity effect on ETP reaction Fig. 7 shows a comparison of the product yields and total acidity levels of SAPO-34 with different Si/(Si+P+Al) ratios for the ETP reaction at 400°C. The SAPO-34 catalysts with different Si/(Si+P+Al) ratios were prepared under the MP 1.5 condition while controlling the gel molar composition of Si:Al:P. The chemical compositions of the prepared SAPO-34 catalysts were measured by ICP-AES. It should be noted that the sizes of the prepared SAPO-34 catalysts were approximately 2–3μm. This size enabled an accurate determination of the exact effects of the Si/(Si+P+Al) ratio. The acidity of SAPO-34 catalysts with different Si/(Si+P+Al) ratios was examined using a NH3-TPD to know how the acidity changes with the different Si/(Si+P+Al) ratios. The product yield was also measured after a reaction time of two hours. In Fig. 7(a), the propylene yield is shown to increase when the Si/(Si+P+Al) ratio increases from 0.084 to 0.098, though it decreases at a Si/(Si+P+Al) ratio of 0.119. It is well known that Si incorporation into the AlPO framework for SAPO-34 molecular sieves is a key factor for acid site generation [22,23,36,37]. In the series of SAPO-34 samples with different Si/(Si+P+Al) ratios, the number of acid sites increased with an increase in the Si/(Si+P+Al) ratio for SAPO-34, as shown in Figs. 7(b-c). This confirms that the number of acid sites is responsible for both the ethylene conversion and propylene formation rate, and a mediocre Si/(Si+P+Al) ratio with moderate surface acidity is favorable for the production of propylene. As shown in Figs. 6 and 7, a hydrogen transfer reaction as a major reaction also occurred on the SAPO-34 zeolite that converted propylene to propane. The propane yield increased as the crystal size increased and with an increase in the Si/(Si+P+Al) ratio. This result may be related to the change of active acid site property as shown in Figs. 3 and 4. It has been reported that the formation of propane from propylene is a more significant reaction for ethylene conversion over CHA zeolites, as the formation of propane decreases the yield of propylene [21,45]. Thus, the hydrogen transfer reaction must be controlled such that it remains slow to maximize the propylene yield. Although optimizing the crystal size and acidity of the SAPO-34 zeolite represent an option when attempting to control the hydrogen transfer rate in this work, more detailed studies are required in the future to understand precisely how to reduce the hydrogen transfer reaction on zeolites for the ETP reaction. 3.7 Possible reaction pathways of ETP reaction over SAPO-34 Fig. 8 illustrates the proposed reaction pathways for propylene production from ethylene at 400°C over the SAPO-34 catalyst. It has been reported that the strong Brønsted acid sites are responsible for the conversion of ethylene [17]. Ethylene molecules react with the Brønsted acid sites, and undergo oligomerization on the surface of zeolite. The cracking of the adsorbed oligomers likely results in the formation of propylene. The interconversion of olefin such as ethylene over an acidic catalyst occurs via two types of reactions: an oligomerization–cracking reaction and a hydrogen transfer reaction [45–49]. Propane appears only when propylene selectivity reaches the maximum at higher conversion of ethylene, suggesting that propane is produced from propylene during the hydrogen transfer reaction. However, the oligomerization-cracking reaction to produce propylene from ethylene is considerably more complex. It has been reported that the steps for the conversion of ethylene as the feed gas should proceed as following procedures [45,46]. Ethylene is dimerized firstly to C4, which is difficult to undergo monomolecular cracking. Then the formed C4 is further polymerized to C6. Because the cracking rate of C6 is faster than the formation rate, C3 is formed dominantly as a conversion product. In this study, we found that the proper amount of the active acid sites through control of the size and acidity level of SAPO-34 were necessary to produce propylene from ethylene through the oligomerization-cracking reaction. However, when the crystal size becomes too large and more acid sites exist on the SAPO-34 catalyst, the propylene formation rate from ethylene is decreased because propane production is favored by the hydrogen transfer reaction. Thus, optimizing the size and acidity of the SAPO-34 catalyst is required for an efficient ETP transformation process. 4 Conclusion A systematic study of the ETP reaction was conducted in an effort to understand how controlling the crystal size and acidity over CHA-type SAPO-34 affect the propylene yield and product distribution. SAPO-34 zeolites with different crystal sizes and acidity levels were prepared via a hydrothermal method while controlling the ratio of MP and TEAOH and changing the Si/(Si+P+Al) ratio. Propylene formation from ethylene exhibited a volcano-type trend with a crystal size of 0.3–13μm and a MP content of 0–2.0 of the SAPO-34 zeolite. The SAPO-34 (MP 1.5) with a crystal size of 3.2μm showed the best ETP performance among the tested SAPO-34 catalysts with different MP amount. In addition, a mediocre Si/(Si+P+Al) ratio with moderate surface acidity was responsible for the highest rate of propylene production. The enhanced catalytic performance when controlling the acidity and size is most likely due to the altered acidic properties of the SAPO-34 zeolite. This study paves the way for improved catalyst designs for the direct ETP reaction.

        "dc:description": "Acidity- and size-controlled SAPO-34 zeolites were prepared via a hydrothermal method by controlling the type and ratio of the structure-directing agents (SDA) such as tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH) and/or morpholine (MP). The SAPO-34 catalysts were applied and tested for their ability to convert ethylene to propylene (ETP) directly. The propylene formation from ethylene showed a volcano-type trend with a crystal size of 0.3–13μm of the SAPO-34 zeolite by changing the ratio of TEAOH and MP. In addition, the propylene yield increased with an increase in the Si/(Si+P+Al) ratio from 0.042 to 0.105 and decreased at a Si/(Si+P+Al) ratio of 0.119. The results show that the proper size and acidity of the SAPO-34 catalyst with controlling the ratio of TEAOH and MP are required for an efficient ETP transformation process. The improved catalytic performance achieved while controlling the size and acidity may be related to number and strength of the active acid sites on the SAPO-34 zeolite.",
