L6pez-Garz6n Dpto de Qu(mica Inorgdnica, Facultad de Ciencias, 18071 Granada, Spain (Received 3 December 1993, revised manuscript received 24 January 1994) Abstract Several activated carbons, prepared using Ni (NO3)2 6H20 and Ni (CO)4 as precursors, are used as supports for nickel catalysts. The influence of the textural characteristics of the supports (surface area, porosity and chemical surface groups) on metal dispersion and the influence of the preparation method, nickel content and reduction conditions (heating rate, temperature and period of reduction) on the characteristics of the catalysts are studied. Finally, the activity of these catalysts in n-butane hydrogenolysis is tested. Key words: activated carbons; butane; carbon; hydrogenolysis; nickel 1. Introduction Nickel catalysts are commonly used in many industrial processes including hydrogena- tion, hydrogenolysis of hydrocarbons and steam reforming. For this reason many papers deal with the characteristics and behaviour of nickel catalysts which are frequently supported on different solids. Inorganic oxides such as silica or alumina [ 1-3] and other materials such as silicates [4] are used as a support for metallic catalysts, although active carbons are increasingly used as supports for metals [5-8] since they are quite versatile materials. In fact, the surface area, porosity and chemical groups of active carbons can affect the characteristics of the catalyst. Moreover, these characteristics (surface area, porosity and chemical groups) can easily be changed using physical or chemical treatment. Bearing these points in mind, the aim of this study is to use different active carbons as supports for nickel catalysts. The active carbons have been obtained from almond shells. This laboratory has wide experience in preparing active carbons with high surface area, porosity and low ash content from this raw material. After preparation, the effect of textural characteristics of the support on catalyst behaviour and the methods of catalyst preparation, *Corresponding author. 0926-860X/94/$07.00 1994 Elsevier Science B.V.

Domingo-Garcia et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 112 (1994) 75-85 nickel loading and reduction conditions on the properties of the catalysts are studied. Finally, the behaviour of the catalysts in the hydrogenolysis of n-butane was considered. 2. Experimental 2.1. Supports Three active carbons were prepared by carbonization and simultaneous activation of almond shells, in a flow of carbon dioxide, at 1123 K for periods of 1, 8 and 16 h. The samples obtained were labelled C1, C8 and C16, respectively. The carbons C1 and C16 were modified by nitric acid oxidation ( 10 cm 3 of concentrated acid/1 g of carbon at 363 K to dryness), and further treatment at 873 K in nitrogen flow for 1 hour, these samples are called Clox600 and C16ox600. Finally, one activated carbon, CA4, was obtained by carbonization of almond shell in nitrogen at 1223 K and further activation in carbon dioxide at 1123 K. The surface area of the supports was calculated from the adsorption isotherms of N2 (at 77 K) and CO2 (at 273 K) measured in a conventional gravimetric system. Mercury intrusion curves up to 4200 atm were plotted from which the pore size distribution of pores O/> 3.6 nm was calculated. Micropore volume, V1, was calculated by applying the Dubinin- Radushkevich equation to the CO2 adsorption isotherm. 2.2. Catalysts Catalysts with nickel loading between 1 and 5 wt.-% were prepared by an incipient wetness technique using Ni(NO3)z\" 6H20 (supplied by Carlo Erba, reagent grade) dis- solved in ethanol or water as a metal precursor. After preparation, catalysts were dried overnight in an oven at 383 K and kept in a desiccator with P205 until use. In addition, catalysts loaded with about 1 wt.-% nickel were prepared by adsorption from the vapour phase of Ni(CO)4 on carbons C16 and CA4. Prior to adsorption from the vapour phase, each sample was outgassed at 10 -2 Torr (1 Torr= 133.3 Pa) for 1 h. The Ni(CO)a was then allowed to reach the bulb where the sample was placed. The closed system was shaken at room temperature for 4 h 30 min and kept closed until use. Catalysts are labelled with the name of the support followed by the metal percentage and (w) if the sample was prepared from aqueous solution of the precursor or Ni(CO)4 for samples prepared by adsorption from vapour phase of this compound. Catalyst metal content was analyzed gravimetrically after burning-off the support at 973 K in air. Percentages recorded here are the average of at least three determinations. The number of nickel surface atoms on the catalysts was determined by chemisorption of hydrogen in a volumetric system. The previous reduction treatment of the catalysts (in the same experimental system) was as follows: (i) 15 min in H2 flow at room temperature, (ii) heating in Hz flow (50 cm 3 min 1) at different heating rates (2.5, 5 or 15 K. min- 1), (iii) 4 or 13 h under H2 flow at the reduction temperature (473,573 or 673 K), (iv) 1 h at 50 K below the reduction temperature under high vacuum, (v) cooling down in vacuum to the chemisorption temperature. M. Domingo-Garcia et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 112 (1994) 75-85 The chemisorption of hydrogen was measured at 298 K. The experimental procedure is the conventional one in which the isotherm of chemisorption in the range 50-250 Torr is obtained. To determine the amount of hydrogen chemisorbed, the extrapolation at P = 0 method was used [9]. Adsorption of hydrogen on all supports was measured under the same experimental conditions and was found to be zero in all cases. The weight loss of the catalysts after reduction and use in the reaction is always lower than 3%. This means that no significant gasification of the supports is induced. Mean nickel particle size was calculated from the equation proposed by Coenen [ 10] for spherical particles as may be expected for catalysts prepared by the impregnation method: 543 d(nm) = (1) SNi where SNi is the metallic surface area (m 2 Ni .g 1 Ni) obtained using a value of 6.33 A. 2 for the cross-sectional area per surface nickel atom and assuming the full reduction of nickel supported. X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (in selected cata- lysts) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (in selected catalysts) were used in addition to chemisorption for a more accurate characterization of the catalysts. The XRD experiments were carried out in a Philips PW 1710 diffractometer using Cu Ka radiation. The peak belonging to the (11 l) Ni plane was selected and the Scherrer equation was applied. Electron microscopy studies were conducted using high resolution Carl Zeiss EM10C equipment. For all experiments samples were ultrasonically dispersed in toluene. Magnifi- cation was between 100 000and 125 000and photographs were analyzed using an image processor (SUN IPC) with Visilog 4.1.1. More than 1000 particles were counted for each sample. The XPS measurements were carried out with a Escalab 200R spectrometer using Mg Ka radiation at 2 kV and 10 mA. Binding energies were determined using the Cls line (284.3 eV) as internal standard. Prior to the experiment each sample was treated at the reduction temperature in hydrogen for 1 h. 2.3. Catalytic test Hydrogenolysis of n-butane was carried out in a flow system described elsewhere [ 11 ]. Catalysts were treated in the same way as for chemisorption measurements. Reaction temperature was between 463 K and 523 K, using a n-C4HIo/H2 mixture at a ratio of 1 / 10. The reaction was carried out at a pressure close to atmospheric and at low conversions. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Supports Some of the surface characteristics of the supports are listed in Table 1. The effect of the heat treatments can be quantified comparing porosity and surface areas obtained from the M.

Results show that the carbons C 1, C8 and C 16 are essentially microporous, macroporosity increasing with period of heat treatment. The SN2 of these carbons are lower than Sco2 which means that there are constrictions on pores hindering the access of nitrogen at 77 K, although this difference decreases with heat treatment. Oxidation treatment with HNO3 and further heat treatment (samples Clox600 and C 16ox600) produces a small increase in surface area and mesopore volume (V2). However, the surface areas measured with nitrogen and carbon dioxide are very close, which means that the treatment has eliminated the pore constrictions. Finally, for the CA4 support, previous treatment in nitrogen and further activation with carbon dioxide produces an important increase in surface area and mesopore volume. Moreover, the Sco2/SN2 ratio is lower than unity, probably because the micropores are widened and while liquid nitrogen is filling them, carbon dioxide is only covering the walls [121. 3.2. Catalysts 3.2.1. Influence of the nickel loading and surface characteristics of the supports Table 2 presents the results obtained from hydrogen chemisorption. Dispersion data have been calculated assuming the stoichiometry H/Ni = 1 and the particle size from the method described above. The latter is compared with the crystal size determined for selected catalysts from XRD measurements. In most catalysts, the dispersion values do not vary much with the metal loading, giving no clear trend. However, for the same nickel loading an increase in dispersion with the meso and macropore volume of the support is apparent (Tables 1 and 2). This means that when preparing a catalyst using an impregnation method only the macro and mesoporosity of the support are accessible to the metal precursor. Meanwhile, the narrow porosity is not acces- sible to the metallic precursor. In terms of surface area this means that no more than 10% of the surface area is available to the metal. This is in agreement with other data previously reported concerning KI supported on glassy carbons [ 13 ], and also with data reported for platinum supported on activated carbons [ 12]. M.

( 1 ) is also shown in Table 2. There is good agreement [3] between the values of d from hydrogen chemisorption and those obtained from XRD measurements. Determination of d by XRD for those catalysts with 1 wt.-% or lower nickel loading was not possible as in these cases the percentage of nickel partially oxidized to NiO when the catalysts are exposed to the air after the reduction treatment is higher than for those catalysts with nickel loading over 2 wt.-%. The highest intensity peak for nickel [plane( 111 ) ] thus overlaps with the maximum for the NiO [plane (200) ]. As the nickel loading is quite low, the measurement is not accurate enough. Likewise, for the same reason (low nickel content) the use of the lower intensity maximum for Ni plane (200) does not give accurate enough values. These complications are overcome when the nickel loading increases, as the maximum for the plane ( 111 ) of nickel becomes clearly defined. Finally, the value of d obtained from hydrogen chemisorption for samples C 1-1.14%Ni and C1 ox600-0.82%Ni has been verified by TEM. The mean values obtained by TEM, 11.4 and 10.8 nm respectively, are in very good agreement with those obtained by chemisorption. 3.2.2. Effect of the reduction conditions The effect of temperature, period of treatment and heating rate on the dispersion of nickel on the catalysts is shown in Table 3. From these data we can deduce that: (i) Heating rate (2.5, 5 or 15 K min-l) has no influence on metal dispersion. (ii) The same trend is also shown for the period of treatment (4 or 13 h). (iii) Increased treatment temperature from 473 to 573 K produces an important increase in dispersion, similar results have been found on Ni/graphite catalysts [14] and probably implies that the degree of reduction at 473 K is lower than 100%. (iv) The increase in temperature from 573 to 673 K produces a clear decrease in dispersion indicating that a significant sintering of nickel particles is produced. Points (iii) and (iv) are also supported by XPS data for catalyst C 16-1.01%Ni, as a binding energy of 855.5 eV belonging to Ni 2 + appears on those catalysts reduced at 473 K. However, when the reduction temperature is increased the former binding energy disappears and a M.

Moreover, the inten- sities ratio Iyi/lc decreases (from 0.0394 to 0.0171) when the reduction temperature increases which confirms the sintering of nickel particles mentioned in point (iv). The main conclusion is that 573 K is the optimum treatment temperature for the reduction of metal particles without sintering. 3.2.3. Effect of the preparation conditions The effect of the solvent used (water or alcohol) and the preparation method (incipient wetness or adsorption from vapour phase) is shown in Table 4. Results of the adsorption method on sample CA4 are also shown. These results indicate that when the incipient wetness technique is used to prepare the catalyst on support C 16 dispersion is not affected by the polarity of the solvent. This probably occurs because there is not a large enough difference between the solvent polarities. How- ever, despite of the trend with reduction temperature found and discussed above, support C 16ox600 renders catalysts with a lower dispersion than the original C 16 [ 15 ]. But when the catalysts C16ox600-0.86%Ni is reduced at 673 K the dispersion increases up to 7.5%, which indicates a higher reduction degree which occurs because the treatment of the support Table 4 Effect of the preparation conditions and of the metallic precursors on catalyst dispersion; reduction temperature 573 K Catalyst H2 adsorption Dispersion (/xmol g cat -t) (%) C16-1.01%Ni 9.8 11.4 C16-1.06%Ni (w) 10.2 11.3 C16ox600-0.86%Ni 3.8 5.2 C16ox600-0.94%Ni (w) 3.2 4.0 CI6-1.58%Ni[Ni(CO)n] 25.6 19.0 CA4-0.84%Ni[ Ni(CO)41 25.0 34.9 M.

Moreover, for the catalyst C 16ox600-0.94%Ni (w) reduced at 573 K, the value of the particle size obtained using Eqn. ( 1 ) for hydrogen chemisorption is 20.9 nm, notably higher than the one obtained from TEM (8.8 rim), which indicates that, as stated before, the reduction of the metal on this support is not completed at this lower temperature. As regards preparation methods, it is seen that better dispersion values are obtained for the catalysts prepared by adsorption of Ni(CO)4 from the vapour phase. This means that after outgassing the supports, the [ Ni (CO) 4 ] can reach the mesopores of the active carbons. The higher mesopore volume of the support CA4 (Table 1) and the lower metal loading, are the reasons for the higher dispersion exhibited by the catalyst CA4-0.84%Ni [ Ni (CO)4]. However, although these catalysts have the highest dispersion values it is important to point out that the XPS measurements indicated the presence of Ni 2+ when the reduction temper- ature was below 573 K. This is shown by the binding energy of 855.7 eV appearing at this lower reduction temperature which corresponds to Ni 2 +. This means that the supported Ni [from Ni(CO)4] has been oxidized. This occurs because the decomposition of Ni(CO)4 renders carbon dioxide and nickel, which in contact with air is oxidized to Ni 2 +. Thus, one of the \"a priori\" advantages of using Ni(CO)4 as precursor, i.e. to have the metal in zero- valent state, is no longer applicable. 3.3. Hydrogenolysis of n-butane Hydrogenolysis of hydrocarbons by hydrogen depends on the nature of the metal catalyst. Nickel typifies a group that has a marked preference for cleavage of the terminal C-C bonds on an alkane chain [ 16,17 ]. When the only reaction is rupture of these bonds hydrogenolysis occurs through the following sequence of reactions steps: n-C4~C3+ M.

The product dis- tribution, conversion percentages and fragmentation factors are shown in Table 5. Product distribution is in agreement with the former inequality suggesting that the rupture of the terminal C~ bonds is the main reaction on these catalysts. The fragmentation factor, has been calculated [ l l ] from the following equation: M.

It is interesting to note that the catalysts with higher dispersions present the lowest fragmentation factors (~:). These results are in good agreement with other published data [ 11 ] and have been explained by the fact that the less favoured formation of multiple bonds between the hydrocarbon and the metal crystallites for small metallic particles pro- duces a lower degree of hydrogenolysis of n-C4Hlo. In Table 6, activity (Ah) and turnover frequency (TOF) of the catalysts at 493 K are recorded. The former, defined as n-butane converted into all its products per gram of catalyst and the latter (TOF) is defined as the number of moles of n-C4Hio converted into all its products per mole of surface metal and per second. It is seen that the activity increases when the dispersion of the metal on the support increases. The turnover frequency is a suitable parameter because it is frequently used to compare different catalysts. In this respect Nazi- mek [ 18], Nazimek and Ryczkawski [ 19] and Romdhane [20] found maximum values of TOF for hydrogenolysis of n-butane on nickel catalysts at about 2.5 nm. In agreement, TOF vs. d in Fig. 1 shows an important increase when particle size decreases below 10 nm. The sensitivity of this reaction to the structure is currently explained by geometric reasons in 300 - ? 0 200' v M 100 i ! i 0 1 2 3 sm~ (m 2 Ni g cat -I) Fig. 2. Activity vs. surface area of metal exposed. The key of symbols is as in Fig. I. M. Domingo-Garcia et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 112 (1994) 7585 such a way that Nazimek [ 18] found that the maximum TOF corresponds roughly to the maximum surface concentration of B5 sites. Also, it is interesting to plot activity vs. surface area of nickel (Fig. 2). A maximum is obtained for the sample CA4-0.84%Ni[Ni(CO)4] and the point corresponding to sample C 16-1.58%Ni [ Ni (CO) 4 ] is near this, indicating the much greater activity of these two catalysts compared to the other. As previously explained, these two catalysts were prepared by adsorbing Ni (CO)4 from the vapour phase. It therefore seems as if this method of preparation produces catalysts which are more active in the hydrogenolysis of n-butane, which means that the influence of particle size in the catalysts activity is higher than the metallic surface exposed. Apparent activation energy values for the hydrogenolysis of n-butane obtained from the classical Arrhenius plots in the range 463-523 K are close to 190 kJ mol-1 with small variations. These values are similar to those obtained by Leclercq et al. [21 ] for nickel supported on dealuminated silica-alumina. 4. Conclusions The main point concerning textural characteristics of the supports is that the microporosity of the active carbons is not accessible to the metal precursor when incipient wetness or adsorption from vapour phase ( at low degree of outgassing, 10- 2 Torr) are used. As regards reduction conditions, a reduction temperature higher than 573 K causes sintering of the metal particles. Nevertheless for samples treated with HNO3 in which there is an increase of oxygen surface complexes, the best dispersion is obtained when the reduction is carried out at 673 K because at lower temperature there is not complete reduction of the catalysts. On the other hand a treatment period longer than 4 h has no effect on final particle size. The adsorption method from vapour phase renders catalysts with higher dispersion than that obtained for catalysts prepared by the incipient wetness technique. This probably results from the lack of an intermediate in the former method. Finally, as previously reported the hydrogenolysis of n-butane is a structure sensitive reaction with a maximum activity for a particle size around 2.5 nm.
