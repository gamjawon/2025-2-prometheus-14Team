Salas-Peregr, F. Javier Lez-Garz Departamento de Quica Inorgico, F. Ciencias, Universidad de Granada, 18071 Granada, Spain Received 8 March 1994; accepted 7 October 1994 Abstract Supported Ru catalysts on activated carbons were obtained from Ru3(CO),2. Two activated carbons with different surface area and porosity obtained by carbonization and COZ activation of olive stones were used as catalyst supports. The supported catalysts, once prepared, were heat treated at 673 K for 12 h in a He or H2 flow or under high vacuum, and subsequently characterized by Hz and CO chemisorption, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Results showed that the highest dispersion was obtained after He treatment and that Ru was present as ruthenium carbide, whereas after Hz treatment metallic Ru was found with a lower dispersion. When the He treatment was carried out at 423 K instead of at 673 K, there was a large increase in both the total and irreversible Hz uptake. The CO chemisorption stoichiometry was also affected by the atmosphere of the previous treatment. Thus, after He treatment CO was linearly chemisorbed, whereas after HZ treatment multiple CO chemisorption predominated. Finally, the behaviour of the catalysts in the hydrogenation reactions of CO2 and CO was also influenced by the treatment atmosphere. Thus, for the HZ/CO2 reaction, the methane production rate, rcHo decreased with reaction time after He treatment, whereas it remained constant after the HZ treatment. However, in the case of the HZ/CO reaction, rc,, remained practically unchanged with reaction time after He treatment, whereas it underwent a large increase after the Hz treatment.

Introduction Hydrogenation of CO and CO2 to methane and higher molecular weight hydrocarbons is important in the purification of ammonia feed, methanation of coal-derived gases and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The reactions are also of interest in the production of process heat from recyclable waste streams containing dilute carbon oxides [ 1 ] . Supported Ru catalysts are some of the most active * Corresponding author. 1381-1169/95/$09.50 1995 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved SSDI1381-1169(94)00023-9 catalysts for both CO andC02hydrogenation [ 14 ] . Their catalysis is also affected by the dispersion of Ru as well as the nature of the supports and the promoters [ 5-10] . Nowadays, activated carbons are of great interest as supports for metal catalysts due to the fact that these materials can be prepared with a high surface area and a well developed porosity which permits them to stabilize small highly dispersed metal particles [ 1130]. The properties and size of these supported metal particles depend on a series of factors, such as: the method of catalyst preparation, precursor 224 C. Moreno-Castilla et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 95 (1995) 223-233 salt used and the pre-treatment given to the supported catalysts to obtain the metal in its zero valent state. In this work, supported Ru catalyst were prepared from Ru3 (CO) 12. Metal carbonyl clusters provide a new class of supported metal catalysts with well defined structures and high metal dispersions as well as the fundamental aspect of catalysis. Most of the work published in the literature about supported Ru catalysts prepared from metal carbonyl clusters has been carried out using inorganic oxides as supports [31,32]. However, there are very few studies using carbon materials as supports. The main differences of these materials compared with the inorganic oxides is that the latter have a smaller surface area and porosity and a different surface chemical nature which can influence the metal. Thus, different Ru structures on inorganic oxides [32] have been found depending on their surface acidity and/or basicity, which affects the activity and selectivity of the supported catalysts. On the other hand, it has been found [ 33 ] that in Ru/Si02 catalysts prepared from Ru3(CO)12 the pretreatment atmosphere influence catalyst dispersion and activity. Also, with Ru/carbon cat alysts prepared from the same precursor [ 11 111, the treatment atmosphere influences the decomposi tion pathway of the ruthenium carbonyl cluster. However, the authors did not report any difference either in catalyst dispersion or activity. The objective of this work is therefore to study the influence of the pretreatment of Ru catalysts supported on activated carbons on their dispersion, chemical composition and activity in the hydrogenation of carbon oxides in order to determine whether there are differences or not with the behaviour of the previously reported Ru/Si02 catalysts. 2. Experimental Two activated carbons were used in the present study as supports for Ru catalysts. Activated carbons were obtained in the laboratory from olive Table 1 Characteristics of the supports Support %Ash SNZ Sco, V, V2 V3 (M2/g) (n,2/g) (cm31g) (cm31g) (cm31g) H14 0.04 725 974 0.43 0.15 0.05 H35 0.10 1190 1220 0.56 0.25 0.07 V, 3.6nm; VZ3.6<O<50nm; V350nm. stones. The procedure followed has been described in preceding papers [ 34,35 ] . The raw material was ground and sifted to a particle size between 1.4 and 2 mm, and was carbonized in a N2 flow at 1273 K for 30 minutes and subsequently activated in C02 at 1263 K for two time periods. Samples obtained are referred to in the text as H14 and H35 (the figure denotes the percentage burnoff of the sample during activation). Activated carbons were characterized by N2 and C02 adsorption at 77 and 298 K, respectively. Surface areas were obtained from the BET equation applied to the N2 adsorption data and from the Dubinin-Astakhov (DA) equation applied to the C02 adsorption data, following the method described elsewhere [ 34,36 ] . Cross sectional areas of N2 and C02 molecules were taken as 0.162 nm2 and 0.195 nm2 respectively [ 37 ] . Pore size distribution was obtained by mercury porosimetry up to 4200 kg / cm2, using a Quantachrome Autoscan 60 porosimeter. From these experiments, the volume of pores with a diameter smaller than 3.6 nn (V1) , between 3.6 and 50 nm (V2) and with a diameter greater than 50 nm (V3 ) were obtained. Ash content (%) of the activated carbons was obtained by burning a known quantity at 1073 K and weighing the residue. All these data are compiled in Table 1. Supported Ru catalysts were prepared from Ru3(CO)12 following a sublimation technique described elsewhere [ 38 ] . For this purpose, the powdered carbonyl was mixed with the appropriate amount of support (to yield about 2% metal loading) in a glass tubing which was sealed under vacuum (10-3 Torr). This closed reactor was mechanically rotated for about 4 hours at a temperature close to 343 K to encourage the carbonyl C. Moreno- Castilla et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 95 (1995) 223-233 225 to sublime evenly onto the support. After cooling to room temperature, the supported catalysts were sieved in order to remove the finest particles produced during the preparation procedure. All catalysts were kept in a desiccator with P205 until their use. The metal content of the supported catalysts was determined by burning a known quantity of the sample at 973 K in a Mettler TA 3000 thermobalance. These experiments were repeated at least five times in order to obtain a mean value for the metal loading. The catalysts are referred to in the text with the name of the support followed by the percentage of Ru. The supported catalysts were characterized by HZ and CO chemisorption at 298 K and, in some cases, at higher temperatures. Prior to the chemisorption runs, catalysts were treated at 673 K with a heating rate of 2 K min-' for 12 h in either He or HZ flow or under high vacuum (around 10-6 Torr) in order to decompose the carbonyl cluster. After He or HZ treatments, the catalysts were outgassed at high vacuum and at 50 K below the reduction temperature for 1 h and then cooled down to the chemisorption temperature. Two HZ chemisorption isotherms were obtained between 50 and 250 Torr [ 39 ] . After the first, the catalyst was outgassed (10-6 Torr) at the chemisorption temperature for 1 h (this time was arbitrarily chosen), and the second chemisorption isotherm was obtained in the same conditions as the first. The method proposed by Benson and Boudart [40] and Wilson and Hall [41 ] was followed to determine HZ uptake. HZ uptake obtained in the first isotherm, QT, gives the total amount of HZ chemisorbed. It is assumed that the uptake obtained in the second isotherm represents the HZ chemisorbed more weakly on the surface metal atoms. This quantity, QR, is referred to in the text as a percentage of the total HZ uptake, QT. Blank HZ chemisorption runs were carried out on the supports and they did not exhibit any Hz uptake. For the CO chemisorption, the dual technique of Yates and Sinfelt [42] was used. This consists of determining the CO isotherm in the 50-200 Torr range, evacuating for 15 min at the chemi- sorption temperature and at high vacuum, and measuring a second isotherm. Subtraction of the two isotherms at 100 Torr gave the amount of CO chemisorbed on the metal. Dispersion, D, and average particle size, d, of the catalysts were obtained from the HZ QT value, assuming that one H atom is chemisorbed by one surface Ru atom and that d (nm) = 0.91 /D (20) . After the chemisorption runs, some selected samples were further characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), using a Zeiss EM10C microscope at a magnification of 125,000 X . Samples were ground and ultrasonically dispersed in toluene. Micrographs were analyzed by a SUN IPC image processor station using Visilog software, the number of particles counted being not less than 3,000. By this procedure, the equivalent circle diameter of the Ru particles was obtained as a length number or arithmetic mean. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), was carried out in Escalab 2008 equipment, that used MgKa (hv=1253.6 eV) as a radiation source, working at 12 kV and 10 mA. Samples were pretreated in He or HZ at 673 K, and subsequently evacuated at 10-5 Torr and transferred to the analysis chamber without exposure to air. The internal standard peak taken to determine the binding energies was that of the carbon C 1 s (284.9 eV). The precision of the binding energy values was around 0.2 eV. The HZ/COZ and Hz/CO reactions were studied in a plug-flow microreactor. About 0.5 g of catalyst was introduced into the reactor and the reactant gases flowed upwards through it. Catalysts were pretreated in either He or HZ flow as in the chemisorption runs. Carbon dioxide hydrogenation was studied between 478 and 573 K with a H2/COZ ratio of 4/ 1 and carbon monoxide hydrogenation between 508 and 583 K with a HZ/ CO ratio of 3 / 1 or 2 / 1. In all cases the conversions were kept low in order to work under differential conditions. Gases were analyzed by gas chromatography using a HWD following the method described elsewhere [43,44]. All gases used in this work were of high purity and were further 226 C.

The uptakes are mean values (up to 3 trials using different samples of the same catalyst) with a precision of better than 10%. At first, it should be pointed out that although all catalysts were prepared in such a manner to yield a 2% metal loading, the final amount of Ru deposited on the supports following the method described before, was not equal in all cases and depended on the porosity of the support. Thus, support H35 with a higher surface area and a more developed meso- and macroporous network than support H14 was capable of admitting a greater amount of Ru, closer to the initial 2%. Several trends are evident from Table 2: (i) QT values depend on the treatment atmosphere, thus the highest value was obtained after He treatment and the lowest after the HZ treatment; the high vacuum treatment ( HV ) gives a QT value closer to that obtained after the He treatment. (ii) HZ uptake at 373 K is quite similar to that obtained at 298 K, which means that the HZ chemisorption on these catalysts is a non-activated process. This is Table 2 Hz uptake at 298 K on the catalysts heat treated at 673 K for 12 h Catalyst Treatment H14-0.84%Ru He H; H35-1.47%Ru He H2 HVe QT QR (lcmol/g cat) (%) 25.2 (21.3) 18.9 69.8 (62.3) 39.6 57.7 ( 60.6 ) 42.0 (49.7) 38.9 43.5 (55.2) 33.2 33.7 (44.7) 8 High vacuum.

( iii ) QR values at 298 K are quite similar, ranging between 30 and 40% of QR, and are independent of the reduction treatment. As expected, QR values obtained at 373 K are higher than those at 298 K. In order to know the effect of the metal content on the dispersion, two more catalysts were prepared with the support H35. The results of HZ chemisorption are compiled in Table 3, and indicate that there is a decrease in QT when the metal content increases up to 4.30%. A later increase up to 5.66% does not affect the QT value. The He treatment again yields catalysts with the greatest capacity to chemisorb 112- It is noteworthy that the He-HZ treatment ( the catalysts were treated for 1 h at 673 K in He and subsequently for 11 h in HZ) gives similar results than the HZ treatment. These results, together with those of Table 2, clearly show that the presence of HZ during the catalyst treatment at 673 K decreases their HZ chemisorption capacity either at 298 or 373 K. This could be due to the fact that both treatments produce catalysts with different particle size and/or with a different chemical composition. Guczi et al [ 33 ] also found that decomposition in a He atmosphere of Ru3(CO)tz supported on silica, gives a catalyst with a higher dispersion (measured from CO adsorption) and higher catalytic activity for CO/HZ and C4Hto/HZ reactions C.

The latter explanation being consistent with several of FischerTropsch synthesis studies [47-50]. On the other hand, Vannice at al [ 11 ] studied by DRIFTS the thermal decomposition of Ru3(CO)t2 supported on an amorphous carbon black and they found that the decomposition pathway of the carbonyl cluster depends on the treatment atmosphere. Thus, the decomposition in He appeared to proceed via decarbonylation of Ru3(CO) )2 followed by fragmentation of the metallic cluster, whereas the rapid formation of H4Ru4(CO) )Z and its subsequent decomposition was observed under H2. Complete decarbonylation in either gas produced zerovalent Ru with a high dispersion, but not as high as that reported in this study, probably because they used catalysts with a higher metal loading ( 8.3% ) . The increase in nuclearity of the original Ru cluster during the initial stages of HZ treatment could lead to a greater Ru particle size. However, these authors do not report any difference in the CO chemisorption at 673 K under either He or HZ as reported by Guczi et al [33]. In order to know whether both treatments produce Ru catalysts of different particle size, the sample H35-5.66%Ru was studied by TEM after treating it in He or HZ at 673 K for 12 h. Particle size distributions (PSD) obtained are given in Fig. 1 and average particle sizes, d, are compiled in Table 4. From Fig. 1, the HZ treatment gives a wider PSD than the He treatment together with a shift of the maximum to a greater size. Thus, the d value found for the HZ treatment was 2.1 nm, whereas for the He treatment it was 1.2 nm. These results therefore indicate that the HZ treatment produces a catalyst with a greater average particle size. It is well known [51,52] that the d value, as well as the dispersion (D), can be obtained from HZ chemisorption measurements taking a chemisorption stoichiometry of H/Rus =1 / 1. In this study, the total amount of HZ chemisorbed, QT, was used to obtain both D and d values. The results are given in Table 4 and they show that d values obtained by either HZ chemisorption or TEM are 228 C.

On the other hand, it is worth noting the high dispersion of all catalysts after He treatment, especially that of H35-1.47%Ru that can be considered as atomic dispersion. Results clearly indicate that He treatment gives a catalyst with a lower metallic particle size than HZ treatment; but both treatments could produce catalysts with different chemical compositions. For this reason, XPS was applied to the catalyst H35-1.47%Ru after treating it (in situ) in both He or HZ atmospheres at 673 K for 2 h. After deconvolution of the Cls and Ru3p3,z curves, the corresponding binding energies (eV) were obtained. These values are compiled in Table 5 and they indicate that: (i) both in the fresh catalyst and in that heat treated in He, there is a peak at 464.1 eV which corresponds to Ru(IV) ; (ii) the catalyst heat treated in H2 presents a peak at 460.9 eV equal to that for Ru3(CO)12, which corresponds to metallic ruthenium, and (iii) from IRII, values it is shown qualitatively, because Ru is supported on a highly porous solid, that the He treatment produces a slight sintering with regard to the fresh catalyst, that is higher after HZ treatment. Therefore, from the HZ chemisorption, TEM and XPS measurements it can be deduced that the He treatment at 673 K gives a ruthenium catalyst with a higher dispersion and with a different chemical composition than the same treatment in HZ. Because Ru(IV) was found in both the fresh catalyst and the one heat treated in He at 673 K, it is reasonable to expect that He treatment at a lower temperature would also yield a catalyst with an active phase capable of chemisorbing H2. Thus, the catalysts were heat treated in He at 423 K for 12 h and after that the HZ chemisorption isotherms at 298 K were measured. The QT and QR values obtained are shown in Table 6. These results are quite surprising because a treatment as mild as He at 423 K yielded a catalyst with a very large HZ chemisorption capacity which can be seen more directly from the QT (423 K) /QT (673 K) ratio. To our knowledge, a Ru catalyst has not yet been described with these characteristics. The high HZ chemisorption capacity of these catalysts could be due to one or more of the following points: (i) a chemisorption stoichiometry, H/Rus, higher than unity; ( ii) spillover of HZ from the Ru particles to the support, and (iii) occlusion of HZ into the metallic network of the active phase. However, point ii probably does not occur because these catalysts usually have quite a low QR ( lower than the same catalysts treated at 673 K); and, point iii is also improbable because the same catalyst treated in He at 673 K has already atomic dispersion (see Table 4), therefore when it is treated at lower temperature (423 K) it would not have the three-dimensional network necessary to occlude H2. All these considerations lead us to believe that the HZ chemisorption stoichiometry in these catalysts should be higher than unity, which would be supported by the low electron density of Table 6 HZ uptake at 298 K on the catalysts heat treated in He at 423 K for lz n Catalyst QT (wmol/g cat) QR (%) QT (423 K)/ QT (673 K) H14-0.84%Ru 141.0 H35-1.47%Ru 207.0 HW44-1.62%Ru 273.7 19.8 5.6 20.0 3.0 18.8 4.3 C.

On the other hand, the QR value of these catalysts (Table 6) is smaller than that obtained when the catalysts were previously treated in He at 673 K (Table 2) . S ayari et al [ 55 ] studied the weak HZ chemisorption on several supported Ru catalysts with a particle size between 0.9 and 12.4 nm and found that QR was around 10% for a particle size of 0.9 nm, reached a maximum of 32% for a particle size of 1.5 nm and took a value of zero for a particle size higher than 2.5 nm. The authors related the weak adsorption with special sites, invoking in particular the BS sites. It is well known [52,56] that the concentration of these sites on the crystallites is highly dependent on their shape. Therefore, the variation in QR with the heat treatment temperature could be due to a change in the shape of the crystallites of the active phase. This change also leads to some degree of sintering of the active phase particles (deduced from XPS measurements) which, brings about a decrease in HZ chemisorption stoichiometry. All these results, together with the fact that after He treatment the active phase is as Ru(IV), suggest that this should be a ruthenium carbide (RuC), because, as experimentally tested, Ru02 has no capacity to chemisorb H2. This RuC would be formed during the preparation of the catalysts by decarbonylation of the Ru3 (CO) 12 and CO dis- CO uptake (gmol/g cat) CO/H j H2 (nm) 146.0 140.5 263.4 262.1 258.6 236.7 164.5 180.0 330.7 353.2 1.04 1.77 0.95 1.81 0.9 1.7 1.4 2.7 0.90 1.2 1.67 2.4 proportionation, since by XPS both the fresh catalyst and the one heat treated in He contained Ru (IV). The H2 treatment of the catalysts would therefore gasify the carbon atoms of the RuC yielding methane and cause the Ru particles to sinter. Some of the above catalysts were characterized by CO chemisorption at different temperatures. The results obtained are compiled in Table 7 and show that CO uptake is independent of the treatment atmosphere (He or H2) and that it decreases when the temperature increases, from 373 to 458 K, indicating that it is not an activated process. These results are different to those previously found [30] with Ru catalysts supported on Saran carbons that reported an increase in CO uptake with temperature. This behaviour was due to the fact that these catalysts were prepared from RuC13 - H20 and it is known [45,46] that after HZ treatment at 673 K, small amounts of chlorine can remain on the catalysts which deactivates the metal particles, making the CO chemisorption an activated process. On the other hand, the results in Table 7 indicate that after He treatment the CO/H ratio is close to 1, whereas this ratio is between 1.5 and 2 after the HZ treatment. It is well known [ 57-59 ] that in Ru catalysts the CO/H and therefore the CO/Rus ratio depends on the nature of the support and the Ru crystallite size. Thus, the CO/H ratio is lower than unity for large crystallites of Ru revealing that CO is mainly chemisorbed in the bridge form, whereas at a smaller Ru crystallites size the CO/ 230 OAS ,a 0.30 0 0.15 0.00 0.16 .o 0 0 0 , o ' 0 0 0 0 0 o 0 o 200 400 boo 800 1000 12Do 1400 t (min) ooo>000000 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 o o aoo boo e00 1000 1200 1400 1600 i (min) Fig. 2.

H ratio is greater than unity, indicating the formation of surface carbonyl species such as Ru (CO)Z, RU (CO)3, Ru (CO)5 and Ru3(CO)12. Results from this study (Table 7) , show that after heat treatment in He the CO is essentially chemisorbed in a linear form. However, when the samples were treated in HZ there was multiple CO Table 8 Activity and selectivity of the catalysts in the HZ/COz reaction at 523 K C. Moreno-Castilla et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 95 (1995) 223-233 chemisorption due to the CO / H ratio being greater than the unity. This is due, in the first case (He treatment), to the fact that the active phase is composed of Ru (IV) which does not have an electronic density high enough to give back-donation bonds with more than one CO molecule per Ru surface atom. However, after HZ treatment the active phase is metallic Ru, with a higher electronic density and therefore, a higher capacity to give back-donation bonds, with more than one CO molecule per surface Ru atom if the crystallite sizes are small enough. On the other hand, if heat treatment in He for 12 h is carried out at 423 K instead of at 673 K, there is also an increase in CO uptake. Thus, for catalyst H35-1.47%Ru this is 243.1 Amol/g cat (treatment at 423 K) and 146.0 jLmol / g cat (treatment at 673 K). However, the CO/H ratio is now equal to 0.59 and not close to the unity which, as mentioned previously, is due to the multiple H chemisorption after the treatment at 423 K. 3.2.

(B) Pretreated in H= flow at 673 K. activity for the CH4 formation, rcH,, decreases with reaction time, and the activity for CO formation, rco, remains almost constant with time. However, neither rcH4 nor rco change with time if the catalysts are previously treated in Hz. The variation of rcH4 with time after He treatment is due to the hydrogenation of the carbon contained in the ruthenium carbide (active phase after the He treatment) under the reaction conditions, which affects the initial catalyst composition and dispersion. Several trends are deduced from the data in Table 8. All data referring to catalysts heat treated in He were taken after six hours reaction. Firstly, the rcH, value for a given catalyst is higher after the He treatment than after the HZ one. However, rco is practically independent of treatment atmosphere. Secondly, after both treatments, He or H2, rcH4 increases and rco decreases when the average particle size of the catalyst increases. The same 231 behaviour is observed when the metal loading of the catalyst increases because this increases the average particle size of the metal catalyst. This behaviour is in agreement with that previously observed [ 6,7,10,32,60] . Finally, apparent activation energy values for CH4 and CO formation, EcH4 and Eco, respectively, are quite similar and independent of the previous treatment and catalyst. The value is around 90 kJ/mol, which is higher than that reported for Ru/A1203 catalysts [ 61 ] , 70.3 kJ/mol, and Ru/Si02 catalysts, 72 kJ/ mol [ 1 ] and 67 kJ/mol [3]. It is known [3], that the HZ/COZ reaction mechanism on Ru catalysts involves, firstly, the COZ dissociation to CO and subsequently, this reaction would proceed with the H2/CO mechanism. Thus, the CO formed would be dissociated giving a highly active surface species, Cs, which would be rapidly hydrogenated to methane. It has been shown [ 3 ] that the concentration of surface species (CO), and CS on the Ru particles is much lower during the H2/COZ reaction than during the H2/CO one. Therefore, the surface species CS formed in the first reaction would be rapidly hydrogenated in an excess of H2, and as a result of the very low concentration of CS species, the carbon atoms contained in the ruthenium carbide (active phase after the He treatment) would be gasified which would bring about a decrease in rcH4 during reaction conditions. When the catalyst H35-1.47%Ru was heat treated in He at 423 K instead of at 673 K, the rcH4 and rco values, 0.45 and 0.24 Amol/g cat.s, respectively, were lower than in the last treatment (see Table 8) ; and rcH4 also decreased with the reaction time. The H2/CO reaction was studied with the catalyst H35-1.47%Ru after its treatment at 673 K for 12 h either in He or H2 and with a H2/CO flow ratio of 3 / 1 and 2 / 1. The only products detected in this reaction were methane and carbon dioxide which is in agreement with results found previously [ 30,62 ] . The presence of COZ can be due to both CO disproportionation and the water-gas shift reactions. 232 C. Moreno- Castilla et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 95 (1995) 223-233 Table 9 Activity and selectivity of the catalyst H35-1.47%Ru in the HZ/CO reaction at 523 K Treatment HZ/CO %S rCH, ECHO In ACH, ratio wmol/g kJ/mol cat s 673 K-He3/1 2/1 673 K-H23/1 2/1 85 0.17 65 0.14 109.515.5 23.4.2 115.511.224.6.1 78 0.17 115.6.3 24.8.9 57 0.14 111.9.023.9.1 Variation of rcH4 and rco with reaction time is given in Fig. 3, as an example, and results obtained at 523 K are compiled in Table 9. From Fig. 3, the behaviour of these catalysts depends on the treatment atmosphere. Thus, after He treatment there is a very slight increase in rcH, with time, whereas after HZ treatment rcH4 markedly increases during the first few hours. The behaviour is different to that observed previously with Ru catalysts supported on V3G or Saran carbon [ 30,62] prepared from RuC13 - H20 and heat treated in H2, in which rcH4 decreased or remained constant with time. This could possibly be due to the different precursor used in this latter study. Moreover, this behaviour is also different to that found in the H2/ C02 reaction, and a possible explanation might be as follows: after He treatment the active phase of the catalysts is RuC that would not be gasified under the reaction conditions because in the H2/ CO reaction the surface concentration of CS species is much higher than in the H2/C02 reaction. Therefore, all of these surface species are not hydrogenated at the same time and are transformed by aging to another surface species Cs' less reactive. The presence of a higher concentration of CS would thus prevent gasification of the ruthenium carbide, or if it is partially gasified it would be regenerated again by the CS species that are not hydrogenated. This argument explains the fact that after the He treatment, rcH4 changes very little with time, and also its large increase during the first hours of the reaction after the H2 treatment, since now Ru is the active phase and it would be transformed to ruthenium carbide by the excess of CS species not hydrogenated during the reaction. Therefore after several hours in the reaction the value of rcH4 is the same (see Table 9 ) regardless of the previous treatment, with He or H2. On the other hand, rcH4 for the HZ/C02 reaction is around three times higher than rcH4for the H/ CO reaction, which is also explained by the different surface concentration in (CO), and CS species of both reactions. Thus, the much lower surface concentration of these species in the H2/ C02 reaction makes them more easily hydrogenable per unit of time in a richer HZ atmosphere. The selectivity to produce methane, S, is higher for catalysts previously heat treated in He and for a H2/CO flow ratio of 3/1. Finally, the values of ECH4 and In ACH4 are independent of the previous treatment, and of the H2/ CO flow ratio. The ECH,value was around 110 kJ/ mol, close to the value of 101 kJ/mol [ 3] for Ru/ A1203 and Ru/Si02 catalysts. However, this value is higher than that of the H2/C02 reaction (90 kJ/ mol); this behaviour has been observed previously [ 3 ] and attributed to the different surface concentration of the CS species. Thus, as previously suggested, the higher CS concentration in the H2/CO reaction prevents all these species from being hydrogenated and they are transformed by aging to another surface species, Cs', less reactive with a slower hydrogenation and a higher activation energy. In conclusion, this work clearly shows that in the case of Ru/activated carbon catalysts prepared from Ru3(CO) t2, the atmosphere of the previous heat treatment influences both catalyst dispersion and the chemical nature of the active phase. Thus, by heat treating in He at 673 K, the highest dispersion is obtained and Ru is in oxidation state (IV), suggesting that it is present as ruthenium carbide. Treatment in He at 423 K causes an increase in both total and irreversible H2 uptake, due to multiple H2 chemisorption. When the catalysts were heat treated in H2 at 673 K the lowest dispersion was obtained and the catalysts were composed of metallic Ru. The nature of the treatment atmosphere also influences the CO chemi- C.

Salas-Peregrín F.Javier López-Garzón Departamento de Química Inorgánica, F. Ciencias, Universidad de Granada, 18071 Granada, Spain ∗ Corresponding author. Supported Ru catalysts on activated carbons were obtained from Ru3(CO)12. Two activated carbons with different surface area and porosity obtained by carbonization and CO2 activation of olive stones were used as catalyst supports. The supported catalysts, once prepared, were heat treated at 673 K for 12 h in a He or H2 flow or under high vacuum, and subsequently characterized by H2 and CO chemisorption, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Results showed that the highest dispersion was obtained after He treatment and that Ru was present as ruthenium carbide, whereas after H2 treatment metallic Ru was found with a lower dispersion. When the He treatment was carried out at 423 K instead of at 673 K, there was a large increase in both the total and irreversible H2 uptake. The CO chemisorption stoichiometry was also affected by the atmosphere of the previous treatment. Thus, after He treatment CO was linearly chemisorbed, whereas after H2 treatment multiple CO chemisorption predominated. Finally, the behaviour of the catalysts in the hydrogenation reactions of CO2 and CO was also influenced by the treatment atmosphere. Thus, for the H2 CO2 reaction, the methane production rate, r CH4 , decreased with reaction time after He treatment, whereas it remained constant after the H2 treatment. However, in the case of the H2 CO reaction, r CH4 remained practically unchanged with reaction time after He treatment, whereas it underwent a large increase after the H2 treatment.
