The corresponding grafted catalysts were prepared by anchoring the complexes onto SiO2 or Pd/SiO2 supports. 13C CP-MAS NMR and XPS spectroscopies showed that the organometallic complexes remained unchanged when they were deposited on the support. High activity and enantioselectivity in the reduction of acetophenone were achieved with some homogeneous complexes. Keywords Bisoxazolines Ruthenium Transfer hydrogenation Supported catalysts 1 Introduction The synthesis of optically pure compounds is still challenging. Asymmetric catalytic reduction of ketones has been extensively studied over last three decades. However few practical industrial applications have been developed mainly due to the problem of recycling the costly catalytic system (i.e. sensitive chiral ligand and transition metals). In order to circumvent these constraints, preparations of heterogeneous catalytic systems were reported according to two main approaches: either grafting of organometallic systems to solid support, or development of heterogeneous catalysts based on supported metals modified by chiral inductors (modifiers) [1]. Although these extensive works allowed high enantioselectivities, these systems remained very specific to the substrates or needed hard reaction conditions. More recently, an alternative approach was reported by Gao and Angelici in which they combined two catalytic systems: a covalently grafted homogeneous complex (i.e. molecular catalyst) associated to supported metallic nanoparticles (i.e. heterogeneous catalyst) on a single support [2]. These so-called TCSM (Tethered Complexes on a Supported Metal), exhibited higher activities than that of the corresponding tethered complex on the support or the supported metal particles separately. These combined catalysts proved to be very efficient not only for the reduction of arene to the corresponding saturated cyclic compounds [3], but also for the hydrogenation of cyclohexanone to cyclohexanol [4], the hydrodehalogenation of fluorobenzene [5] and the hydroformylation of terminal olefins [6]. The enantioselective hydrogenation of methyl-α-acetamidocinnamate with such catalysts (rhodium-chiral phosphine complexes tethered to palladium on silica) was also reported [7]. In ref. [3], the organometallic complex was immobilized over silica through sulfonato groups that formed strong H-bonds to silanols. Such a “hybrid system” (i.e. Rh(I)–Pd(0)/SiO2) is four times more active than the heterogeneous Pd(0)/SiO2 for the hydrogenation of arenes. Blum and co-workers reported the preparation of entrapped rhodium complex and palladium nanoparticle in a sol–gel material that exhibited high activities towards aromatic hydrogenation [8]. It has been proposed that the catalytic efficiency of the TCSM is a consequence of a hydrogen-spillover process enhancing thus the hydrogenation activity of the grafted molecular catalyst. However, this mechanism remains a subject of discussions. More recently, Bianchini et al. proposed that the enhanced activity of a Rh(I)–Pd(0)/SiO2 was due to a simultaneous activation of the substrate through isolated rhodium-grafted complex (i.e. single sites catalytic activation) and the palladium nanoparticles [9]. This explanation was supported by EXAFS, DRIFT measurements and batch catalytic experiments [10]. TCSM, when involving chiral complexes, could bring advantages to the development of enantioselective catalysts. Considering the previous literature reports, it can be expected that milder conditions should be necessary to achieve similar activities for a combined catalyst and the “parent” single species. As a consequence, one can expect enhanced optical purity using such systems. To our knowledge, a single report is dealing with the use of combined catalysts in asymmetric hydrogenation [7]. The authors grafted a [(2S,4S)-4-(diphenylphosphino)-2-(diphenylphosphinomethyl)pyrrolidine-rhodium-(COD)] complex on silica (SiO2) and supported-palladium on silica (Pd-SiO2) after modification of the diphosphine ligand. These catalysts were evaluated for the enantioselective hydrogenation of methyl-α-acetamidocinnamate, both giving high conversions and enantioselectivities (>90%); however, one should mention that the original rhodium complex used in this study was known to be highly active and selective for this reaction (ee >94%). Previously, we reported the synthesis of new heterogeneous chiral bis(oxazoline)-ruthenium complexes efficient for asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of ketones [11]. The corresponding rhodium-based complexes were less efficient in terms of optical purity but they could be grafted on silica without affecting their structures [12]. In this paper, we report the synthesis of homogeneous oxazoline-based ruthenium catalysts, as well as the corresponding grafted ([Ru]/SiO2) and combined ([Ru]/Pd@SiO2) catalysts. These catalysts were characterized by liquid- and solid-state NMR and XPS measurements and their catalytic properties were evaluated in the asymmetric reduction of acetophenone. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Preparation of the homogeneous catalysts The chiral bis(oxazoline) ligand 1 (BoxPh) and 2 (BoxOH) were synthesized in good yields (50–62%) from the commercially available diethylmalonimidate dihydrochloride and (S)-phenylglycinol or (1S, 2S)-2-amino-1-phenylpropanediol, respectively. Subsequently, the OH-protected ligand 3 (BoxOTMS) was obtained in high yield (94%) by treatment of 2 with TMSCl in THF/NEt3 [11,12]. The chiral pyridine-oxazoline ligands 4 (PyOxPh) and 5 (PyOxPr) were synthesized from commercially available picolinic acid and (S)-phenylglycinol or (S)-valinol, respectively, in reasonable yields (30%). Neutral chiral diphosphine ruthenium(2-Methylallyl)2 complexes are known to be very efficient in enantioselective hydrogenation of CC bonds or as precursors to active complexes for asymmetric hydrogenation of CO bonds [13]. These complexes are synthesized by reaction of the corresponding diphosphine with the [Ru(COD)(Metallyl)2] precursor complex. As to our knowledge, the corresponding pyridine-oxazoline or bis(oxazoline) complexes (named after along this paper “dinitrogen” complexes for convenience) were not described, we studied the reaction of [Ru(COD)(Metallyl)2] with the above ligands and more precisely BoxPh 1. Unfortunately, whatever the reaction conditions, the NMR analysis of the solid isolated after the reaction showed that the cyclooctadiene ligand was still chelated to the metallic centre. This was probably due to the fact that the dinitrogen BoxPh was not a ligand as good as the commonly used diphosphine [13] and was not able to shift the cyclooctadiene moiety from the ruthenium. Alternatively, cationic ruthenium complexes were then studied. The synthesis of the dinitrogen-chelated cationic ruthenium complexes from commercial [Ru(p-Cymene)Cl2]2 dimer was previously described [14]. These complexes exhibited efficient activity in Diels-Alder reaction or Claisen rearrangement. The Ru(II)-catalysts 6–10 were then synthesized in high yields (90–99%) in degassed methanol at room temperature for 6h by using a procedure very similar to that described by Dixneuf and co-workers [14] (Scheme 1 ). All complexes were fully characterized through their NMR and IR spectra, [α]D and elemental analysis. As a typical example, the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of complex 7 are given in Fig. 1 . All signals corresponding to the BoxOH ligand in the complex 7 were split compared to the naked ligand 2 meaning that the C2 symmetry of the ligand was not retained in the complex. The extensive attribution of the peaks was established with HMQC and COSY45 analyses. A clear difference (more than 2ppm: 164.5 and 166.8ppm) was observed for the two CN moieties. Moreover, both protons borne by the central carbon of the bisoxazoline ligand were significantly separated by more than 1ppm (3.64 and 4.71ppm). As the counter-ion could affect significantly the activity and/or selectivity of the catalyst, the hexafluorophosphate 11, tetrafluoroborate 12 and tetraphenylborate 13 complexes analogous of 7 were prepared by metathesis. Typically, complex 7 was treated with one equivalent of the corresponding sodium salt in acetone (Scheme 1) to give the expected cationic complexes isolated by filtration and evaporation of the solvent. 1H NMR spectra similar to that of 7 were observed for complexes 11–13. Whatever the counter ion, no single crystal could be isolated. Molecular modelling of complex 7 was made using MM2 parameters extended to transition metals. The structure corresponding to the thermodynamic energy minimum was further investigated using DFT calculations with the B3LYP functional and the LanL2DZ pseudopotential. At completion, it was checked that the optimized structure corresponds to a minimum by calculation of the infrared spectrum. Absence of imaginary frequencies confirms the energy minimization. As shown on Fig. 2 , a piano-stool arrangement is observed for the sandwich complex in which the ruthenium centre is coordinated to the p-cymene ring on one face, and to the two nitrogen atoms of the BoxOH ligand and the chloride ion on the second face, in good agreement with previous reports for similar complexes [15,16]. The main feature of the calculated structure is the presence of one hydrogen bond between one of the hydroxymethyl substituent of the Box ligand and the chlorine atom on ruthenium (d(HCl)=2.19Å), accounting for the loss of C2-symmetry in the complex 7 as observed from NMR experiments. 2.2 Preparation of the grafted and combined catalysts In order to achieve the heterogeneisation of complexes 6–8 onto silica, a tris(ethoxy)silyl-alkyl chain was introduced at the bridging CH2 of the bis(oxazoline) ligands 1–3 following reaction conditions described by Clarke and Shannon [17]. Treating 1–3 with nBuLi and I(CH2)Si(OEt)3 in THF gave the new ligands 14–16 in high yield (>95%). These ligands were further used without any purification. The corresponding cationic ruthenium complexes 17–19 were obtained in excellent yields (88–96%) following the procedure described above. NMR analyses of the new complexes 17–19 were similar to that observed for the related complexes 6–8. The grafted catalysts ([Ru]/SiO2) and the combined one ([Ru]/Pd@SiO2) were prepared by treating a suspension of activated silica (SiO2) or silica supported-palladium (Pd@SiO2) with the corresponding ruthenium complexes 17–19, respectively (Scheme 2 ). After filtration, extensive washing to remove the soluble non-grafted complexes and drying, the catalysts were analyzed to determine the grafting level. The corresponding data are collected in Table 1 . According to the elemental analysis, the presence of palladium on the silica did not affect the amount of grafted complex on the support. Whatever the initial complex, 0.16–0.20mmolcomplex g−1 were grafted on the support, in good agreement with literature data [18,19]. The successful grafting of the three complexes was supported by 13C CP-MAS NMR analysis of the different catalysts. Whatever the support used, identical NMR spectra were obtained for BoxOH-based complexes grafted on SiO2 (18/SiO2) or Pd@SiO2 (18/Pd@SiO2) meaning that in both cases the complex was grafted on the silicium oxide via silicate bridges and was not adsorbed on the metallic surface, as predictable, in the case of [Ru]/Pd@SiO2 (Fig. 3 ). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was used for qualitative and quantitative characterizations of the homogeneous 8, grafted 19/SiO2 and combined 19/Pd@SiO2 catalysts. The binding energy for the Ru 3d5/2 as well as the N/Ru and Ru/Pd atomic ratios is reported in Table 2 . A binding energy of 285eV corresponding to the C1s level was used as internal standard. The Ru 3d5/2 binding energies were in the range 281.5–281.8eV whatever the catalyst. Such values are in accordance with the presence of ruthenium in the +2 oxidation state as reported in the literature ([Ru(bpy)3]Cl2·xH2O; Ru 3d5/2 281.6eV) [20]. The close values observed for the three catalysts indicate that no modifications in the coordination sphere around the ruthenium centre, even in the presence of metallic palladium, occurred during the grafting procedure. The nitrogen/ruthenium atomic ratio calculated for the molecular catalyst 8 (2.0) was in good agreement with the expected value (2.0). Moreover, similar N/Ru ratios were obtained for the heterogeneous catalysts: the complex was then stable upon grafting without decomposition unlike the behaviour of the corresponding rhodium complexes. As expected from the XPS technique, the ruthenium/palladium ratio of the combined catalyst is higher than the corresponding ratio calculated from elemental analysis (6.2 and 4.1, respectively). 2.3 Reduction of acetophenone with ruthenium-based catalysts. Asymmetric reduction of acetophenone in the presence of the dinitrogen chelated ruthenium complexes 6–13 and the heterogeneous catalysts [Ru]/SiO2 or [Ru]/Pd@SiO2 was studied. Both iPrOH/tBuOK and HCOONa/H2O conditions were evaluated and the main results are reported in Table 3 . Using the reductive system iPrOH/tBuOK, all homogeneous ruthenium-based complexes 6–13 were evaluated. The pyridine-based complexes 9 and 10 showed no activity. On the other hand, the bisoxazoline based complexes 6–8 were efficient for this transformation. It was checked that the enantioselectivities kept constant all over the conversion. The highest enantioselectivity was achieved with complex 7 (90%, entry 2) bearing nitrogen functions as well as free hydroxyl groups [11]. The groups of Andersson and Wills reported the large enantiodifferentiation in transfer hydrogenation of ketones with stereochemically rigid β-amino alcohols [21,22]. The preparation of the catalyst did not influence its catalytic behaviour since similar conversions and enantioselectivities were achieved with the isolated complex 7 or the in-situ prepared catalyst (entry 2 versus 4). As the nature of the counter anions was known to modify the activity of some complexes in hydrogenation reactions [23], we examined their influence in the hydride transfer reduction of acetophenone. Surprisingly, none of the weaker coordinating anions led to an active catalyst (not shown). At this stage, we focussed on the most active complex 7. Careful attention to perform iPrOH/tBuOK reduction under strictly anhydrous conditions must be followed since the presence of water induced lower yield and enantioselectivity (entry 5). Xiao and co-workers reported recently very elegant asymmetric reduction of ketones using HCOONa as reducing agent in water [24,25]. We studied these reduction conditions in the presence of bisoxazoline-based ruthenium complexes 6 and 7. For this study, only in-situ prepared catalytic systems were evaluated. Negligible conversion was observed with complex 6 (entry 1). On the other hand, in the presence of complex 7, in pure water, a high enantiomeric excess was achieved but with a moderate yield (entry 2). This was easily overcome by addition of iPrOH in the reaction medium. Thanks to the presence of the cosolvent, all species were completely dissolved yielding very high conversion and optical yield (90% ee, 90% conversion; entry 3). Such reduction conditions are very useful as they do not need anhydrous conditions neither high pressure. The grafted [Ru]/SiO2 and combined [Ru]/Pd@SiO2 catalysts were evaluated in the same reaction. The reactions were performed in the presence of 3.3–3.8% Ru complexes and 1% Pd when mentioned (Table 4 ). No significant conversion was achieved with BoxPh-based catalysts (17/SiO2 and 17/Pd@SiO2). Fig. 4 gives the conversion of acetophenone as a function of time with the BoxOH and BoxOTMS-based catalysts (i.e. 18 and 19/SiO2; 18 and 19/Pd@SiO2). Significant lower reaction rates were achieved with the grafted complexes whatever the ligand and the support. The highest conversion was achieved in the presence of 19/Pd@SiO2 yielding 43% conversion after 8 days while almost complete conversion was observed with the homogeneous catalyst after 24h. The calculated initial reaction rates and the observed conversions and ees after 8 days are summarized in Table 4. As expected, silica supported palladium was not active for the reduction of acetophenone (entry 1). Using the BoxOH-based catalysts 18/SiO2 or 18/Pd@SiO2, similar activities were observed whatever the support (entry 2 versus 3) showing no influence of the presence of palladium particles. Surprisingly, the behaviour of the BoxOTMS-based catalyst 19/SiO2 or 19/Pd@SiO2 was affected by the presence of palladium on the support (entry 4 versus 5). The role of the palladium particles is not clear. It can be suggested that some dehydrogenation of iPrOH occurs on the surface improving thus the catalytic activity, while we do not have evidences for such a hypothesis. Unfortunately, very low enantiomeric excesses were achieved with these catalysts. 3 Conclusion Homogeneous and heterogeneous chiral ruthenium-catalysts based on bis(oxazoline) and pyridino-oxazoline ligands have been prepared and fully characterized. These catalysts were then immobilised by grafting onto silica or silica supporting palladium particles. After anchoring, the structure of the organometallic complexes remained intact even in the presence of palladium on the support as outlined by the 13C CP-MAS NMR and XPS analyses. The activity and selectivity of the homogeneous catalysts were evaluated for the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone using iPrOH/tBuOK or H2O-iPrOH/HCOONa systems as hydrogen donors, the last conditions being particularly of interest for applications (cheap, no need of anhydrous conditions). While the heterogeneous [Ru]/SiO2 and combined [Ru]/Pd@SiO2 catalysts exhibited low activity (<20%) and enantioselectivity (<20), up to high conversions and enantioselectivities were achieved using homogeneous systems. The best results were achieved in the presence of {[RuCl(BoxOH)(p-cymene)][Cl]}catalyst (90% conversion and 90% ee). Further studies aim at developing more active heterogeneous mixed catalysts [M]/Pd@SiO2 (M: Rh, Ru, Ir…) by controlling carefully the distance between the two partners of such catalytic system to improve their cooperation during the reaction. 4 Experimental All preparations, manipulations and reactions were carried out under argon (Schlenk techniques), including the transfer of the catalysts to the reaction vessel. All glassware was base- and acid-washed and oven dried. THF was distilled over sodium from purple benzophenone under argon before use while CH2Cl2 and CHCl3 were distilled over CaH2. Ligands 1–6 were prepared according literature [11,12]. Flash chromatography was performed using silica (Merck Silica Gel 60, 230–400mesh). Thin layer chromatography was performed on Fluka Silica Gel 60 F254. Silica Aerosil 200 was agglomerated prior to use by treatment with water. After evaporation and drying at 120°C for 3 days the resulting material was crushed and sieved to give a selected fraction with a particle size of 40–60mesh. BET of a silica sample dehydroxylated at 500°C under 10−5 mmHg for 6h gave the following characteristics: specific surface=204±4m2/g. All catalyst supports were dried before use at 120°C for 48h under 5.10−2 mmHg. Solution NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker AM 250 spectrometer (1H NMR were referenced to the residual proton of the solvent: CDCl3, δ =7.25ppm; 13C NMR were referenced to the C-signal of the deuterated solvent: CDCl3, δ =77ppm). Solid-state 13C-CP-MAS NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DSX 300 or DSX 500 spectrometer. 13C NMR were arbitrarily referenced to the internal aromatic signal of the phenyl-ring substituent on the oxazoline ring at 128ppm. XPS measurements were recorded on an ESCALAB 250 spectrometer equipped with an Al-K source (1486.6eV). The measurements of the binding energies were referred to the characteristic C1s peak of the carbon fixed at the generally accepted value of 285.0eV. The absolute ruthenium content of the catalysts was determined by ICP-AES from a solution obtained by treatment with a mixture of H2SO4 and HNO3 and HF in a Teflon reactor at 150°C then with HCl at room temperature. The absolute palladium content of the catalyst was determined by ICP-AES from a solution obtained by treatment with a mixture of HF, HNO3 and HCl in a Teflon reactor at 180°C. Gas chromatography was performed on a Shimadzu 14A chromatograph equipped with a FID detector and a Chirasil Dex CB column. 4.1 Synthesis of homogeneous complexes The ligand (2eq.) and the ruthenium dimer [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2 (1eq.) were dissolved in degazed methanol (0.5mmole per 10mL of MeOH) and stirred 6h at room temperature. The solvent was then evaporated and the obtained solid was dried under vacuum. {[RuCl(BoxOH)(p-cymene)][Cl]} 7: orange solid, 95% yield, m.p.=118–126°C (decomposition), [α]D 25 =−111.1 (c =0.2, CHCl3), IR: ν(CN)=1667cm−1, 1H NMR (CDCl3, 250MHz): 7.30 (m, 10H, CH (C6H5)); 6.33 (d, 3 J(H,H)=8.7Hz, 1H, CH (C6H4)); 6.10 (d, 3 J(H,H)=8.7Hz, 1H, CHO); 5.93 (d, 3 J(H,H)=8.7Hz, 1H, CH (C6H4)); 5.83 (d, 3 J(H,H)=8.7Hz, 1H, CH (C6H4)); 5.78 (d, 3 J(H,H)=8.7Hz, 1H, CHO); 5.71 (d, 3 J(H,H)=8.7Hz, 1H, CH (C6H4)); 4.71 (d, 2 J(H,H)=19.5Hz, 1H, NCCH 2CN); 4.44 (d, 3 J(H,H)=8.7Hz, 1H, CHN); 4.38 (d, 3 J(H,H)=8.7Hz, 1H, CHN); 4.19 (m, 2H, CH 2OH); 3.83 (m, 1H, CH 2OH); 3.66 (m, 1H, CH 2OH); 3.64 (d, 2 J(H,H)=19.5Hz, 1H, NCCH 2CN); 2.92 (sept, 3 J(H,H)=6.8Hz, 1H, CH (iPr)); 2.32 (s, 3H, CH 3 ); 1.23 (d, 3 J(H,H)=7.0Hz, 6H, CH 3(iPr)); 13C NMR (CDCl3, 62.9MHz): 166.8 (CN); 164.5 (CN); 136.6 (Cq(C6H5)); 136.5 (Cq(C6H5)); 126.1 to 129.6 (CH(C6H5)); 107.8 (Cq(C6H4)); 98.3 (Cq(C6H4)); 85.5 (CHO); 84.4 (CHO); 84.3 (CH(C6H4)); 84.2 (CH(C6H4)); 81.7 (CH(C6H4)); 81.6 (CH(C6H4)); 80.8 (CHN); 75.6 (CHN); 59.9 (CH2OH); 59.4 (CH2OH); 30.9 (CH(iPr)); 28.7 (NCCH2CN); 22.6 (CH3(iPr)); 22.0 (CH3(iPr)); 18.4 (CH3).

The mixture was then stirred for 1h at room temperature (r.t.) under argon. Then toluene was removed by evaporation leading a slightly yellow material. This solid was calcined under air flow (100mL/min) at 300°C for 2h and then reduced under H2 flow (80mL/min) in a U-reactor at 300°C for 2h to give the desired Pd(0)/SiO2 catalyst as a black material. AAS determination gave 0.84±0.05%wt Pd. 4.3 Preparation of tethered complexes on silica or on Pd-SiO2. Typical procedure The desired complex (1eq./surface OH) was added to a suspension of SiO2 or Pd-SiO2 in dry CH2Cl2 (15mL/0,1mmol). The mixture was stirred for 24h at room temperature. The heterogeneous catalyst was filtered under argon, washed twice with 10mL of dry CH2Cl2 and dried under vacuum. {[RuCl(BoxOH)(p-cymene)][Cl]}/SiO 2 18 /SiO 2 : NMR 13C (125.4MHz): 170 (CN); 139 (Cq(C6H5)); 128 (CH(C6H5)); 84 (OCH; CH(C6H4); Cq(C6H4)); 77 (NCH); 63 (CH2OH); 50 (CH2 CH2CH2); 32 (NCCHCN; CH (p-cy)); 19 (CH2 CH2CH; CH3 (p-cy)); 11 (CH2Si).

The mixture was stirred at 50°C during 24h. The same protocol was performed with the grafted or combined catalysts using 3.5% [Ru] and, if apply, 1% [Pd]. A treatment was made on the sample before GC analysis: to a 0.4mL sample was added 0.3mL of dichloromethane. The mixture was washed with 0.2mL of aqueous HCl 0.1N. The organic layer was filtered through a MgSO4 pad and analyzed by chiral GC. 4.5 Reduction with iPrOH-H2O/HCOOH Under argon, 0.01mmol of [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2 and 0.022mmol of ligand were dissolved in degazed H2O/iPrOH (4/2) mixture. After stirring for 1h, 1mmol of acetophenone and 5mmol of HCOONa were introduced and the solution was heated at 50°C for 24h. After cooling, the solution was neutralized with HCl and extracted with CH2Cl2. The organic layer was dried over MgSO4 and analyzed by GC.
