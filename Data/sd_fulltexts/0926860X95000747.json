The catalyst may be applicable to KA-oil (a mixture of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone) for the formation of 2,6dimethylphenol using methanol as a methyl group source. Keywords: Dimethylphenol; Chromium/ magnesia 2,6-Dimethylphenol is useful as a starting material for the manufacture of polyphenylene oxide, an important engineering plastic [ 1 ] . Currently, the industrial synthetic method is a liquid-phase process, where phenol is methylated with methanol using an A1203 catalyst; however, this process not only needs a high pressure and temperature but also produces a wide range of products, including various isomers of xylenol [ 2,3 ] . In the present communication we report a novel synthesis method of 2,6-dimethylphenol from methanol and cyclohexanol in one step at atmospheric pressure and elevated temperatures over magnesium oxide modified with chromium (Cr-Mg0). In an extension of this study, we have found that the catalyst may be applicable to KA-oil (mixture of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone) for the formation of 2,6-dimethylphenol using methanol as a methyl group source. The reactions were carried out in a fixed-bed system at atmospheric pressure. Mixtures of cyclohexanol and methanol (1:10) were fed by a syringe pump and vaporized. The vapor was diluted with nitrogen and the total flow-rate was held * Corresponding author. 0926-860X/95/$09.50 1995 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved SSDI0926-860X(95)00074-7 L230 F-L. Wang et al. /Applied Catalvsis A: General 126 (1995) L229-L233 constant at 45 ml min'. All chemicals used were of reagent grade quality and were commercially available. The Cr-MgO catalysts were prepared by impregnating magnesium oxide with a solution of chromium nitrate, Cr(N03) -9H20. The chromium content (wt.-%) was based on the concentration of chromium ion in the solution. After impregnation, the catalysts were dried in air at 383 K for 24 h. All the catalysts were heated in air for 6 h at 773 K before the reaction. The Cr-MgO catalysts maintain a stable activity for cyclohexanol conversion as well as a stable selectivity after an initial deactivation lasting a few hours. Results at steady state are summarized in Table 1. The reaction of methanol and cyclohexanol over various Cr-MgO catalysts yields methylated phenol, including 2,6DMP and 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (2,4,6-TMP), methylated cyclohexanol (2-methylcyclohexanol and 2,6-dimethylcyclohexanol), methylated cyclohexanone (2-methylcyclohexanone and 2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone) and trace amounts of cyclohexanone (runs 1-18). Excess methanol was recovered after the reaction in addition to small amounts of methane and carbon monoxide which might be formed by methanol decomposition. The combination effect of Cr and MgO is clearly revealed in the selectivity changes. It is worth noting that the selectivity toward 2,6-DMP can be enhanced by the addition of fairly small amounts of chromium ion, while the formation of 2-methylcyclohexanol and/or 2,6-dimethylcyclohexanol is decreased. The optimum results for conversion and selectivity were obtained for Cr(2.5 wt.-%) /MgO, for which catalysts the selectivity towards 2,6DMP attained 60% (runs 1-6). This suggests that the proton abstraction ability of basic sites on the surface of MgO is enhanced by the addition of chromium to Mg0 and is consistent with the formation of 2,6-DMP. By analogy with the alkylation of acetonitrile over Cr-MgO to give acrylonitrile, the chromium(III) ion shows stronger Lewis acidity than the magnesium ion [ 4 ] . The anion formed by deprotonation of cyclohexanol-like species at basic sites is more stabilized by adsorption onto CrIII ion sites then onto Mg', ion sites, making deprotonation more feasible. In addition, we have also found that, except for chromium, other 3rd period transition metals do not enhance the characteristic activity of MgO for the formation of 2,6-DMP from the reaction of methanol and cyclohexanol. Thus, at the moment, Cr and MgO are the best combination for the reaction. When the conversion of cyclohexanol was increased by varying the reaction temperature or contact time, the product distribution changed markedly in different ways. The exception to this was the selectivity towards 2-methylcyclohexanol and 2-methylcyclohexanone which decreased with conversion for both paths (runs 4, 7-18) , The selectivity of 2,6-DMP increased, passed through a maximum, and then decreased, while the selectivity to 2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone increased continuously with the temperature, and 2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone was the main product at high reaction temperatures (runs 4, 7-12). However, as the contact time was varied, formation of 2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone and 2,6-DMP showed inverse effects. Selectivity towards 2,6-DMP was higher at longer contact times while that for 2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone was lower (runs 4, 13-18).

Since dehydrogenation of the alcohol function would be easier than dehydrogenation of the ring, these results imply that the ketone (cyclohexanone and methylated cyclohexanone ) could be an intermediate en route to the phenol. They further suggest that the mechanism for the formation of 2,6-DMP, although not entirely clear yet, might consist of a series of complex dehydrogenation, condensation, and dehydration steps. It is interesting that such a multi-step reaction readily takes place on the surface of the catalyst, and this prompted us to study the reaction of KA-oil (mixture of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone) and methanol for the formation of 2,6-DMP. The results of the reaction of KA-oil and methanol (mole ratio; 1:10) at 400 over Cr-MgO are summarized in Table 2, where values of conversion and selectivity are calculated on the KA-oil basis. The selectivity to 2,6-DMP strongly depends on the ratio of cyclohexanone to cyclohexanol in KA-oil. The optimum results for conversion and selectivity were obtained for the ratio = 1, for which the selectivity towards 2,6-DMP attained 40%. Further work is needed in order to increase the selectivity. However, this study demonstrates again that 2,6-DMP is formed via a ketone intermediate from methanol and cyclohexanol in one step over Cr-MgO catalysts.
