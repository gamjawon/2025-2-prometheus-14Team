Graphical abstract Biomass-derived porous carbon with single-atom cobalt sites is synthesized as cathode to promote the transformation of cathode electrolyte interface in Zn-S batteries, thereby boosting the conversion between S and ZnS. Aqueous zinc-sulfur batteries at room temperature hold great potential for next-generation energy storage technology due to their low cost, safety and high energy density. However, slow reaction kinetics and high activation energy at the sulfur cathode pose great challenges for the practical applications. Herein, biomass-derived carbon with single-atomic cobalt sites (MMPC-Co) is synthesized as the cathode in Zn-S batteries. The catalysis of single-atom Co sites greatly promotes the transform of cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) on the cathode surface, while offering accelerated charge transfer rate for high conversion reversibility and large electrochemical surface area (ECSA) for high electrocatalytic current. Furthermore, the rich pore structure not only physically limits sulfur loss, but also accelerates the transport of zinc ions. In addition, the large pore volume of MMPC-Co is able to relieve the stress effect caused by the volume expansion of ZnS during charge/discharge cycles, thereby maintaining the stability of electrode structure. Consequently, the sulfur cathode maintains a high specific capacity of 729.96 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 4 A g−1, which is much better than most cathode materials reported in the literature. This work provides new insights into the design and development of room-temperature aqueous Zn-S batteries. Keywords Biomass-derived carbon Single-atom catalysts Rich pore structure Sulfur cathode Aqueous zinc-sulfur batteries 1 Introduction It is essential to develop clean energies (solar power, wind energy, hydroelectric power, etc.) to overcome the environmental pollution and fast consumption of fossil energy issues, but facing great challenges from low cost, high power density and high-energy density energy storage technology in practical applications [1,2]. In recent years, metal-sulfur batteries have attracted widespread attention due to the high theoretical capacity of sulfur (1675 mA h g−1), low expense, abundant raw materials, and environmental friendliness [3,4]. Many research papers on metal-sulfur batteries have been reported, including lithium-sulfur (Li-S), sodium-sulfur (Na-S), magnesium-sulfur (Mg-S), and aluminum-sulfur (Al-S) batteries [5–8]. Owing to the chemically active nature of metallic Li and Na, Li-S and Na-S batteries need to be prepared in an anhydrous and oxygen-free environment, which increases the production cost and assembly difficulty of batteries. Moreover, organic electrolytes used in Li-S and Na-S batteries are highly flammable and result in a large amount of safety hazards [9,10]. In addition, metal-sulfur batteries inevitably have some shortcomings, including poor conductivity of sulfur and corresponding polysulfides, slow reaction kinetics, and shuttle effect of polysulfides [11,12]. To cope with these challenges, it is necessary to continuously optimize these battery systems or innovate new battery systems. Rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZBs) are one of the promising energy-storage systems due to their reliable safety, environmental friendliness, rich raw materials and high theoretical capacity (820 mA h g−1) of zinc anode [13,14]. Nowadays great progress has been made in the cathode materials of AZBs, including manganese-based oxides, vanadium-based oxides, Prussian blue analogs and organic compounds [15–18]. Since the storage mode of zinc in these cathode materials is mainly based on intercalation chemistry, the specific capacity of AZBs is usually less than 400 mA h g−1, thus failing to fully utilize the advantages of zinc anode and reducing the energy density [19]. In comparison, sulfur cathodes based on conversion reaction have higher theoretical capacities and are expected to endow AZBs with higher energy density than intercalation-type cathodes. However, several problems also need to be addressed for aqueous zinc-sulfur (Zn-S) batteries. The conversion-reaction kinetics of S cathode in aqueous electrolytes is slow, hindering the development of batteries [20]. The volume expansion of ZnS causes the electrode material to pulverize, exacerbating battery capacity degradation. The poor wettability of aqueous medium to sulfur electrode hinders the transport of Zn ions in the cathode, leading to huge polarization [21]. The irreversible SO4 2− formed during battery operation causes the loss of sulfur molecules and the reduction of Coulombic efficiency [22]. In addition, hydrogen evolution reaction and zinc dendrite growth also induce battery failure [23]. To address the above issues, a variety of carbon nanomaterials have been applied to load sulfur, which improves the conductivity of sulfur and alleviates the stress effect caused by the volume expansion of discharge products [24]. However, the catalytic activity of carbon nanomaterials themselves is weak and insufficient to promote the redox kinetics of sulfur. Herein, a strategy implanting single-atom catalysts into inexpensive biomass-derived porous carbon has been proposed to maximize the catalytic effect and boost the reaction kinetics of sulfur electrode. Micro-mesoporous carbon with single-atom cobalt (MMPC-Co) has been successfully synthesized by a multistep heat treatment from mangosteen peel. The as-prepared MMPC-Co exhibits larger specific surface area, pore volume and pore diameter than pure MMPC, which provides more active sites. After loading sulfur, the sulfur cathode (S@MMPC-Co) demonstrates obviously increased electrical conductivity compared to pure sulfur. When used in AZBs, S@MMPC-Co maintains a capacity of 729.96 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at a 4 A g−1 and achieves high-rate performance (507.21 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1). Various characterization techniques reveal that S@MMPC-Co exhibits good integrity of electrode structure and conversion-reaction kinetics between sulfur and zinc sulfide (ZnS) during the charge–discharge process, which can be attributed to the high catalytic activity of single-atom cobalt. This work provides a new pathway for the development of sulfur-based batteries with low cost, high-energy density and good safety. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials HCl was purchased from Wuxi Jingke Chemical Co., Ltd. I2, S, KOH and K3[Co(CN)6] were purchased from Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co. Super-P, Ti foil, Zn foil, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and CR2032 button cells were bought from Guangdong Canrd New Energy Technology Co., Ltd. Zn(CF3SO3)2 was obtained from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. Ethylene carbonate (EC) was purchased from Shanghai Titan Scientific Co., Ltd. Mangosteen was purchased from RT-Mart supermarket. Resistivity of deionized water is 18.2 MΩ cm from Milli-Q. 2.2 Sample preparation The mangosteen peels were dried at 80 °C for 24 h and then grounded into powder. The powder was then stirred in 1 M HCl overnight, washed with deionized water until the water turned colorless, and dried at 80 °C for 12 h. The dried mangosteen peel powder, KOH and K3[Co(CN)6] were uniformly dispersed in water with a mass ratio of 1:2:1. The concentration of the solution is approximately 53.33 mg mL−1 and stirred overnight, and then freeze-dried to remove the moisture. The mixed precursors were then heated continuously in a tube furnace at 200, 300, and 400 °C for 1.5 h, respectively, and at 700 °C for 3 h in an Ar atmosphere at a heating rate of 3 °C min−1. The calcined product was soaked in 2 M KOH at 45 °C for 6 h, and washed with deionized water until the solution became neutral. The sample was then soaked in 1 M HCl at 45 °C for 12 h, washed with deionized water to neutrality, and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h to obtain the final product (named MMPC-Co). The control sample MMPC was prepared by the same process, except that no K3[Co(CN)6] was added. S@MMPC-Co was obtained by loading sulfur onto MMPC-Co via a two-step melt-diffusion method. The MMPC-Co and sulfur were uniformly ground with a mass ratio of 1:1.1 for 20 min at least, heated in a tube furnace at 155 °C for 15 h under an Ar atmosphere, and then heated at 200 °C for 0.5 h to obtain the final product (S@MMPC-Co). The preparation process of S@MMPC was the same as that of S@MMPC-Co except using MMPC instead of MMPC-Co. 2.3 Materials characterization The microstructure of the samples was obtained through field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM-IT800, Japan) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20, USA). Element distributions were recorded using an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) attached to a TEM (Hitachi HF5000, Japan). High-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM) measurements were performed on JEOL JEM-ARM 300F. The crystal structure of the samples was measured via an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8A A25, Germany) with a Cu Kα source (λ = 1.5418 Å). The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm of the samples was measured using the Autosorb-iQ automatic specific surface and pore size distribution analyzer (Quantachrome, USA). The quenched solids density functional theory (QSDFT) mode was selected to analyze the pore size, and pore volume of the samples. The molecular structure and surface groups of the samples were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, Thermo Scientific Nicolet IS5, USA) and Raman spectroscopy (Thermo Scientific DXR3 microscope, USA) with a 532 nm laser. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific ESCALAB Xi+, USA) with a monochromatic aluminum anode X-ray source was adopted to analyze the chemical composition and electronic structure of the sample surface. The elemental contents of C, H, N and S in the sample were measured with an elemental analyzer (Elementar Unicube, Germany). The Co content in MMPC-Co was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Agilent 725-ES). X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) Co K-edge spectra were conducted by the transmission mode at the TPS 32A beamline with tender X-ray range (1.7–11 KeV) in China, which utilizes a banding magnet (BM). Co foil and oxides were used for energy calibration and data comparison. XAS data were processed and analyzed using the Demeter software package [25]. A linear function was subtracted from the pre-edge region, then the edge jump was normalized using Athena software. The χ(k) data were isolated by subtracting a smooth, third-order polynomial approximating the absorption background of an isolated atom. The cut-off value for R bkg was set to 1 to ensure removal of the artificial peak that can appear below 1 Å in the spectra of Co materials. The k 2-weighted χ(k) data were Fourier-transformed after applying a Hanning window function (Δk = 1 Å−1). The global amplitude reduction factor (S 0 2), coordination numbers (N i), distances to the scattering atoms (R i), and mean-squared displacements (σ i 2) were obtained by nonlinear fitting, with least-squares refinement, of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) equation to the Fourier-transformed data in R-space, using Artemis software. EXAFS spectra of individual paths were simulated using FEFF6 [25], using imported crystallographic information files for the model compounds. The wavelet transform (WT) was performed with the HAMA Fortran package [26]. In a typical WT analysis, k-weight = 0, and the Morlet function was used, with k = 10, σ = 1 [27]. 2.4 Electrochemical measurements The active material, Super-P, and CMC binder were ground into a uniform slurry with deionized water at a mass ratio of 7:1.5:1.5. This slurry was then coated on a Ti foil. The electrode was obtained after drying at 60 °C for 4 h in a vacuum oven. The active material loading of conventional electrode was 1–1.2 mg cm−2, while the high-loading electrode was ∼4.33 mg cm−2. The CR2032 coin cells were assembled in air, using glass fiber as separator (Whatman, GF/D), and Zn foil as counter electrode, respectively. The electrolyte was based on a previously published literature with slight adjustments [28]. 2 M Zn(CF3SO3)2 in H2O/EC (3:2 by volume) containing 0.15 wt.% I2 was used as electrolyte. The galvanostatic measurement was performed on LANHE CT3002A battery test system (Wuhan, China) at room temperature (26 ± 4 °C) in the voltage range of 0.05–1.6 V. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were performed on a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation at the scan rate of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1 mV s−1, respectively. The electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) was measured using CHI 760E electrochemical workstation at the open circuit voltage in the range of 0.1–50000 Hz with an amplitude of 5 mV. The galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) tests were implemented on LANHE CT3002A battery test system. For the post-cycle analysis of battery, the cycled cathodes and anodes were soaked in ethanol three times for 24 h each time, and then dried in air. In this work, specific capacity and current density were calculated based on the mass of sulfur. 3 Results and discussion The preparation procedure of S@MMPC-Co is shown in Scheme 1 . MMPC-Co was prepared via a multi-step annealing process. Mangosteen peel powder, KOH, and K3[Co(CN)6] were mixed evenly in deionized water. To make Co(CN)6 3− ions evenly immerse into the mangosteen peel powder, freeze drying was employed. Moreover, the cyanide groups with a regular hexagon around the central Co atom can effectively disperse and stabilize Co atoms through Co–CN coordination to avoid the agglomeration of Co atoms in the following pyrolysis. MMPC-Co was thus obtained through a direct pyrolysis of the mixture precursor followed by washing with alkali and acid in order. Fig. S1 shows that the calcined product contains Co3[Co(CN)6]2, CoO and Co3O4, which is due to the addition of excess K3[Co(CN)6]. Co3[Co(CN)6]2 is only soluble in alkali solutions and produces Co(OH)2 precipitation. Co(OH)2, CoO and Co3O4 dissolve in acid. Therefore, it is first washed with alkali followed by acid. Impurities cannot be removed by water wash alone. The preparation process of the control sample (MMPC) was similar to that of MMPC-Co, except that K3[Co(CN)6] was not added. A two-step melting method was employed to infiltrate sulfur into MMPC-Co to obtain S@MMPC-Co. As shown in Fig. 1 (a), MMPC-Co still maintains a three-dimensional porous structure similar to MMPC (Fig. S2a), indicating that the addition of K3[Co(CN)6] causes little changes in the morphology of the material. It can be seen from the TEM images (Figs. 1b and S2b) that both MMPC and MMPC-Co maintain interconnected pore structures. In addition, the amorphous nature of MMPC-Co (Fig. 1c) also provides compelling evidence that there are no obvious Co clusters in the carbon matrix. The HAADF-STEM images were obtained to elucidate the existence of Co species in porous carbon. As shown in Fig. 1(d), due to the stronger scattering of transition metal elements, many dispersed points with high brightness are detected (especially highlighted with circles), clearly indicating the presence of Co single atoms in the porous carbon. After the alkali washing and acid washing processes, Co single atoms are retained due to the strong coordination of CoNC, while the unstable Co nanoclusters are almost removed. After loading sulfur, S@MMPC-Co still maintains a three-dimensional interconnected porous structure (Fig. 1e). HRTEM image shows that S@MMPC-Co still remain the disorder (Fig. 1f) and no obvious diffraction rings or dots are observed in the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image (inset of Fig. 1f). Elemental mapping images also verify the uniform distribution of different elements in S@MMPC-Co (Fig. 1g), indicating the successful formation of single-atom cobalt and penetration of sulfur into MMPC-Co. The determined content of Co in MMPC-Co is 0.426 wt.% by ICP-OES. X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements were performed to further assess the local structure of Co sites in MMPC-Co. The Co K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectrum of MMPC-Co is shown in Fig. 1(h). The white line peak of MMPC-Co is located between CoO and Co3O4, and is closer to CoO, indicating that the ability of Co to bind electrons is similar to that of CoO. The Fourier-transform EXAFS (FT-EXAFS) of Co foil is shown in Fig. 1(i). A major peak at 2.15 Å in the FT magnitude (not phase-corrected) arises due to CoCo single-scattering. The broad intensity in the region 4–5 Å in the FT-EXAFS of Co foil is consistent with CoCo single-scattering in the extended solid-state structure. MMPC-Co peaks appear at 1.5 and 2.24 Å, respectively. The intensities in the FT magnitude of MMPC-Co at 4–5 Å decrease strongly relative to the spectrum of Co foil. Suppression of the peak at 4–5 Å is consistent with disruption of the extended structure (and therefore disappearance of the CoCo path), thereby indicating that the CoCo bond does not exist in MMPC-Co and that Co exists as a single atom. Compared with cobalt foil, the WT map of MMPC-Co further confirms the distribution of atomic cobalt (Fig. S3). The structure of the Co sites in MMPC-Co was investigated further by EXAFS curve fitting. The fits are shown in Figs. 1(j) and S4, and curve-fit parameters are summarized in Table S1. The CoN1 path at 2.05 ± 0.01 Å is significantly longer than the corresponding bond distance in CoN (mp-1009078, from Materials Project, 2.004 Å), presumably due to electronic difference. Fitting analysis of the EXAFS spectra reveals that the coordination number is 4 for CoN1, suggesting the dominant CoN4 coordination structure in MMPC-Co. Although CoN2 and CoCo paths appear in the fitting results, the CoN2 bond at 2.93 Å and CoCo bond at 3.31 Å do not exist in the actual CoN crystal structure (mp-1404786, from Materials Project). In the XRD pattern of MMPC-Co (Fig. 2a), the peak at 26.6° is attributed to the (1 1 1) crystal plane of graphite (JCPDS No. 75-2078). In addition, two broad humps are shown at 23° and 43°, indicating the existence of amorphous carbon, which is consistent with the results of HRTEM and SAED images of MMPC-Co. The XRD pattern of MMPC only shows two broad peaks at 23° and 43° and no peak at 26.6°, which indicates that the graphite may originate from the decomposition of K3[Co(CN)6] at high temperature [29]. Compared with S@MMPC, the XRD pattern of S@MMPC-Co does not show an obvious sulfur peak. However, the broad peak at 43° slightly shifts, indicating that sulfur penetrates into MMPC-Co and turns into amorphous sulfur. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements were performed to analyze the specific surface area and pore size distribution of the samples. Typical type I isotherms for MMPC and MMPC-Co with H4 type hysteresis loops are shown in Fig. 2 (b), which indicates the existence of micropores and mesopores. MMPC-Co has a larger specific surface area (2402.06 m2 g−1) than MMPC (1276.86 m2g−1), which indicates that the introduction of K3[Co(CN)6] enriches the pore structure, thus increasing the specific surface area of MMPC-Co. The computational model of N2 on carbon at 77 K (slit/cylindrical pores, QSDFT adsorption branch) was chosen to analyze the pore structure information of MMPC and MMPC-Co, because the fitting error under this model was the smallest (0.068% and 0.158%, respectively) among all fitting models (Fig. S5a). Fig. 2(c) displays the pore-size distribution curves of MMPC and MMPC-Co. It is observed that the pore diameters of MMPC-Co are mainly 0.545, 0.889 and 3.096 nm, while the values for MMPC are 0.545 and 2.195 nm. This indicates that MMPC-Co has abundantly larger pore structure, which can accelerate the transport of zinc ions inside the pores, thereby improving the battery performance of MMPC-Co. In addition, the micropore volume and mesopore volume of MMPC-Co is 0.693 and 0.915 cm−3 g−1, respectively, both of which are higher than that of MMPC (0.406 and 0.351 cm−3 g−1). This suggests that the introduction of K3[Co(CN)6] not only enriches the pore structure of MMPC-Co, but also expands its pore volume. The cumulative pore volume curve also shows that as the pore diameter increases, the pore volume of MMPC-Co is always higher than that of MMPC (Fig. S5b). Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that when the same amount of sulfur is loaded, MMPC-Co can alleviate the stress effect caused by volume expansion better than MMPC. This is beneficial to maintaining the integrity of the structure and reducing the loss of sulfur in the material. After sulfur penetration, the specific surface area of S@MMPC-Co (284.36 m2 g−1) decreases significantly, but is still higher than that of S@MMPC (17.15 m2 g−1) (Fig. 2b). The pore structure of S@MMPC and S@MMPC-Co also changes. Namely, the micropore disappears, leaving only mesopore (3.31 nm for S@MMPC and 3.707 nm for S@MMPC-Co), which indicates that sulfur successfully penetrates into the pores of MMPC-Co (Fig. S6) [30]. Furthermore, the pore volume of S@MMPC-Co is 0.365 cm−3 g−1, much higher than S@MMPC (0.048 cm−3 g−1), which would be beneficial for the loading of sulfur. The graphitization degree of the samples was analyzed by Raman spectroscopy. Both MMPC and MMPC-Co exhibit typical G-band and D-band peaks near 1350 and 1580 cm−1, but the relative intensities of the peaks are different (Fig. 2d). The ID /IG value of MMPC-Co is 0.88, which is smaller than that of MMPC (0.97), indicating that MMPC-Co has a higher degree of graphitization than MMPC. After loading sulfur, this trend remains, that is, the I D/I G value of S@MMPC-Co (0.97) is still smaller than that of S@MMPC (1.00), indicating that S@MMPC-Co has a higher degree of graphitization. Carbon materials with higher degree of graphitization have better conductivity [31]. This demonstrates that MMPC-Co and S@MMPC-Co have better electrical conductivity than MMPC and S@MMPC. The functional groups of the samples were analyzed by using FT-IR. Infrared spectra of MMPC and MMPC-Co in Fig. 2(e) show identical groups, namely CH (625 cm−1), COC (1108 cm−1), CC (1587 cm−1), CH2 (2928 cm−1) and OH (3438 cm−1). These results show that the introduction of K3[Co(CN)6] cannot change the functional groups of MMPC and the formed single-atom cobalt structure cannot affect the groups either. S@MMPC and S@MMPC-Co also maintain the same groups, indicating that the high catalytic activity of S@MMPC-Co is independent of functional groups. The sulfur content in the sample is the absolute mass fraction measured by an elemental analyzer using the combustion method, as shown in Table S2. S@MMPC-Co has a sulfur content of approximate 55 wt.%. The elemental composition and chemical state of a sample surface can be analyzed through XPS. The survey spectra of MMPC and MMPC-Co show obvious signals of C, N, O and S elements, but there is no obvious Co signal due to the low Co atomic content (Fig. S7). It can be seen from the high-resolution N 1s spectra of MMPC and MMPC-Co that the N element signal of MMPC-Co is significantly stronger than that of MMPC (Fig. 2f), indicating that the surface of MMPC-Co contains more nitrogen elements, which originates from the surface-absorbed [Co(CN)6]3−. The N 1s spectrum can be deconvoluted into four peaks, namely, pyridinic N, pyrrole N, graphitic N and oxidized N [32]. Interestingly, the peak of pyridinic N in MMPC-Co is shifted by about 0.25 eV toward lower binding energy relative to MMPC, indicating that N gains electrons, which may be due to the binding of pyridinic N and Co. In the high-resolution O 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 2g), the binding energy of CO and CO in MMPC-Co moves toward the lower binding energy direction, which may be due to the electron donation of abundant nitrogen on the surface of MMPC-Co. Fig. S8 shows the fine spectra of C 1s and S 2p of MMPC and MMPC-Co, respectively. The spectra assigned to C 1s and S 2p of MMPC and MMPC-Co are almost identical, indicating that they are not affected by the introduction of K3[Co(CN)6], that is to say, they are not associated with the high catalytic activity of MMPC-Co. After loading sulfur, the peaks of CO and CO in S@MMPC-Co move to the direction of high binding energy by 0.75 and 0.95 eV, respectively, in the high-resolution O 1s spectrum (Fig. 2h), which may be attributed to the electron redistribution caused by the introduction of sulfur. The bonds of S8 molecule are broken at high temperature, forming metastable small sulfur molecules (S2–4) [33]. These metastable small sulfur molecules interact with C atoms, changing the electronic equilibrium states of CO and CO, thereby inducing a shift in binding energy. The same situation was also observed in the C 1s and N 1s fine spectra of S@MMPC-Co (Fig. S9). As shown in Fig. S9(d), the intensity of S 2p peak of S@MMPC-Co is significantly stronger than that of MMPC-Co, and the intensity of CS peak increases significantly, indicating that sulfur successfully infiltrates into MMPC-Co and interacts with C. Fig. 2(i) shows that S@MMPC-Co still maintains the pyridinic N structure, while S@MMPC does not, indicating that the formed single-atom structure is stable and cannot be affected by sulfur penetration. The electrochemical energy storage performance of S@MMPC-Co as a cathode of Zn-S battery was tested in the form of a coin cell with aqueous electrolyte at room temperature. Fig. 3 (a) shows the CV curves of S@MMPC and S@MMPC-Co over a voltage range of 0.05–1.6 V at 0.2 mV s−1. The reduction peak potentials of S@MMPC-Co are 0.35 V (peak 2) and 1.16 V (peak 1), respectively. The reduction peak at 1.16 V is not related to the conversion of sulfur, but to the reduction of the redox mediator I3 − [34]. This is confirmed by the CV curve of MMPC-Co as shown in Fig. S10, in which MMPC-Co has almost the same reduction peak at 1.16 V but not at 0.35 V. This indicates that the reduction peak of S@MMPC-Co at 0.35 V is related to the reduction of sulfur. S@MMPC does not show a reduction peak at 0.35 V and the onset potential of sulfur reduction is obviously more negative than that of S@MMPC-Co. It shows that S@MMPC-Co has better catalytic activity than S@MMPC, and the polarization potential for sulfur reduction can be reduced due to the catalytic effect of the single-atom cobalt. During the charge process, S@MMPC-Co shows an obvious oxidation peak at 1.31 V (peak 3), which is attributed to the oxidation of I− and ZnS [34]. As shown in Fig. 3(b), S@MMPC-Co retains a specific capacity of 715.19 mA h g−1 after 180 cycles at 1 A g−1, while S@MMPC only retains 181.64 mA h g−1. Furthermore, the Coulombic efficiency of S@MMPC-Co remains 99%. It is noted that the battery capacity significantly decreases during the first 40 cycles, which is caused by the activation and interface reconstruction of the electrode material. This phenomenon has been confirmed by numerous studies [35–39]. Fig. 3(c) shows the galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) curves of S@MMPC-Co at 1 A g−1. In the first 40 cycles, S@MMPC-Co has discharge platforms at 0.4 and 0.15 V, respectively, while S@MMPC only exhibits a platform at 0.15 V (Fig. S11). The polarization of the discharge plateau of S@MMPC-Co at 0.15 V gradually increases with the increase of the number of cycles. After the battery stabilizes, the voltage platform at 0.15 V disappears completely, leaving only a discharge platform at 0.4 V. The result clearly indicates that the decrease in battery capacity is caused by the increase in battery polarization, which is related to the formation of a solid electrolyte interface on the electrode surface [40]. The rate performance of S@MMPC-Co was measured at different current densities, as shown in Fig. 3(d). The specific capacities of S@MMPC-Co at 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4 and 5 A g−1 are 1445.38, 990.63, 602.35, 562.1, 530.48 and 507.21 mA h g−1, respectively, which are much higher than those of S@MMPC. When the current density drops back to 1 A g−1, S@MMPC-Co exhibits a reversible capacity of 1147.96 mA h g−1. Moreover, Fig. S12 also shows that S@MMPC-Co has more stable Coulombic efficiency. The good rate performance of S@MMPC-Co is related to its rich pore structure, because the rich pore structure is beneficial to the penetration of electrolyte, thereby accelerating the transport of zinc ions [41]. At the same time, the single-atom Co sites with highly catalytic activity promote the rapid conversion of S and Zn, reducing the generation of intermediate polysulfides and irreversible SO4 2− [42]. This is consistent with the GCD curve trend of S@MMPC-Co with reduced polarization and a distinguishable plateau, whereas the plateau of S@MMPC gradually disappears (Fig. S13). Fig. 3(e) shows the capacity retention rates of S@MMPC and S@MMPC-Co at 1.5, 2, 3, 4 and 5 A g−1. The capacity retention rates of S@MMPC-Co are 68.5%, 41.7%, 38.9%, 36.7% and 35.1%, respectively. Compared with S@MMPC, S@MMPC-Co not only maintains a higher reversible capacity, but also has a higher capacity retention rate at different rates. The rate performance of S@MMPC-Co catches up with the rate performance reported in most literatures. As shown in Fig. 3(f), in the long-cycle performance test, electrochemically activated S@MMPC-Co delivers an excellent capacity of 729.96 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 4 A g−1, which is much higher than that of S@MMPC (56 mA h g−1). S@MMPC-Co also exhibits a more stable Coulombic efficiency than S@MMPC, always remaining above 99% (Fig. S14). An interesting phenomenon is observed that the capacity of S@MMPC-Co gradually increases as the number of cycles increases at 4 A g−1, instead of the traditionally gradual decay. The GCD curves of S@MMPC-Co at 4 A g−1 are shown to analyze the reason of this interesting phenomenon (Fig. S15). It can be seen that the shape of the charge–discharge curve has not changed, and no additional platforms have appeared, indicating that the electrochemical reaction in the battery has not changed. However, as the cycle number increases, the polarization of the discharge curve gradually decreases. As the current density activating the electrode material increases, the amount of sulfur in the electrode material participating in the battery reaction decreases. When the battery operates stably at 4 A g−1, the previously unreacted sulfur gradually participates in the reaction under the catalytic effect of single-atom Co sites in S@MMPC-Co. The decrease of polarization prompts more sulfur to participate in the reaction, thus leading to a gradual increase in battery capacity. Fig. 3(g) compares the battery performance of S@MMPC-Co with that reported values in the literature for aqueous Zn-S batteries at room temperature, which shows the competitive performance of S@MMPC-Co. The detailed data are shown in Table S3. Fig. 3(h) compares the GCD curves of S@MMPC and S@MMPC-Co at 4 A g−1. The discharge platform of S@MMPC-Co is significantly improved, resulting in a much smaller polarization potential difference than S@MMPC [28,43]. This also shows that MMPC-Co effectively activates sulfur molecules, reduces the polarization potential between S and Zn, and accelerates its reaction kinetics. In order to explore the commercialization potential of S@MMPC-Co, the performance of cathode with high loading mass was tested. Fig. 3(i) shows the cycle performance of the battery when the loading mass of S@MMPC-Co is 4.33 mg cm−2. S@MMPC-Co has a high reversible capacity of 615.79 mA h g−1 after 88 cycles at 1 A g−1. The long-term cycling stability of S@MMPC-Co suggests that rich pore structure and single-atom Co sites in biomass-derived carbon can effectively modulate the cathode materials for high-performance aqueous Zn-S batteries at room temperature. EIS was conducted to evaluate the interfacial charge transfer capability. Prior to EIS testing, the batteries were cycled at 1 A g−1 for 100 cycles to reach a steady state. Fig. 4 (a) shows the Nyquist plots of S@MMPC and S@MMPC-Co in the discharged state. The equivalent circuit can be seen in the inset of Fig. 4(a), and the fitted results are listed in Table S4. S@MMPC-Co exhibits a much smaller interface charge transfer resistance (19.67 Ω) than S@MMPC (40.88 Ω), indicating faster interface charge transfer, which is consistent with the electrocatalytic activities assessed by the CV results above (Fig. 3a). The GITT reveals that the initial discharge potential of S@MMPC-Co at the beginning of discharge is higher than that of S@MMPC (Fig. 4b), indicating that MMPC-Co delivers a more positive potential for the sulfur reduction reaction, resulting in lower polarization and thus promoting the reduction kinetics of sulfur. The CV curves at different scanning rates were used to further study the kinetic process of S@MMPC-Co, as shown in Fig. S16. As the scan rate increases, in addition to the increase in current, the potential of S@MMPC-Co also shifts, leading to an increase in polarization. The diffusion coefficient of zinc ions can also be calculated according to Eq. (1). (1) I p = 2 . 69 × 1 0 5 n 1 . 5 A D Zn2 + 0.5 C Zn2 + v 0 . 5 where I p, n, A, D Zn2+, C Zn2+, and v represent the peak current, the number of electrons (n=2), the electrode area (A=1.13 cm2), the diffusion coefficient, the concentration, and the scanning rate. Fig. S17(a) shows the linear fitting curves between I p and v 0.5 for S@MMPC-Co. The diffusion coefficient of S@MMPC-Co can be calculated according to the slope of the fitting curve. As shown in Fig. S17(b), S@MMPC-Co has a higher diffusion coefficient (6.18 × 10−15 cm2 s−1) than S@MMPC (4.85 × 10−16 cm2 s−1), particularly for peak 2. Eq. (2) was applied to analyze the influence of adsorption and diffusion on the kinetic process of S@MMPC-Co [44]. (2) log i = log a + b log v where i, b, and v represent the current, constant, the scanning rate. When b value is close to 0.5, it is a diffusion-controlled process, and it is an adsorption-controlled process when b value is close to 1. Fig. S18 shows that b values of S@MMPC and S@MMPC-Co, are 0.725 and 0.812, respectively, indicating that ion diffusion and adsorption are involved in the reaction of electrode. The influence of ion diffusion and adsorption on the electrode reaction can be further analyzed according to Eq. (3). (3) i = k 1 v + k 2 v 1 / 2 where k 1 v is the adsorption-controlled process and k 2 v 1/2 is the diffusion-controlled process. The constants k 1 and k 2 can be determined by plotting i/v 1/2 versus v 1/2 at a fixed potential [44]. Fig. 4(c) shows the contribution of ion diffusion and adsorption to the capacity of S@MMPC-Co at different scan rates. Compared with S@MMPC, S@MMPC-Co exhibits more contribution from the adsorption-control process at all scan rates, because MMPC-Co accelerates the reaction kinetics of S and Zn. In addition, with the increase of scan rate, the adsorption-control contribution in S@MMPC-Co also gradually increases. To evaluate the ECSA of S@MMPC and S@MMPC-Co, electrochemical double-layer capacitance (C dl) was measured in a range of 0.875–0.925 V (Fig. S19), in which there is no Faraday current. The results show that the C dl of S@MMPC and S@MMPC-Co is 0.029 and 0.114F cm−2, respectively (Fig. 5 d). The larger the C dl, the greater the ECSA. Therefore, S@MMPC-Co has a larger ECSA than S@MMPC, which indicates that S@MMPC-Co creates more reaction active sites than the latter one for better discharge rate and power density. The reaction mechanism of the S@MMPC-Co cathode was revealed using ex-situ XRD. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the initial cathode (point a) shows the same XRD peaks as the S@MMPC-Co powder except for the diffraction peaks of the substrate Ti foil (JCPDS No. 44-1294). When the electrode is discharged to 1.16 V (point b), no obvious peak appears. Since less sulfate is formed, no XRD peak is detected; but the sulfate signal appears in the subsequent XPS S 2p spectrum. After discharging the electrode to 0.48 V (point c), the peak signals of (Zn(OH)2)3(ZnSO4)(H2O)5 (JCPDS No. 78-0246) are observed at 24.4° (0 0 3) and 33° (3 −1 1), due to the use of Zn(CF3SO3)2 [45,46]. After discharging to 0.13 V (point d), the signals of (Zn(OH)2)3(ZnSO4)(H2O)5 not only become obviously stronger at 24.4° and 33°, but also appear at 16.2° (0 0 2) and 21.3° (−1 0 2), respectively. Additionally, the ZnO (JCPDS No. 21-1486) signal appears at 58.7°. When the electrode is discharged to a cut-off voltage of 0.05 V (point e), the diffraction peaks of ZnS (JCPDS No. 05-0566) are clearly observed at 28.6° (1 1 1), 47.5° (2 2 0), and 56.3° (3 1 1) [28]. With charging to 0.95 V (point f), the diffraction peaks of ZnS at 47.5° and 56.3° weaken, indicating that the ZnS is oxidized. After charging to 1.22 V (point g), the ZnS diffraction peak signals further weaken. When the electrode is charged back to 1.6 V (point h), the diffraction peaks of ZnS, ZnO, and (Zn(OH)2)3(ZnSO4)(H2O)5 all disappear. Since the sulfur formed is still in an amorphous state, the electrode shows essentially same XRD peaks as the initial state. This means that a highly reversible transformation occurs between S and Zn due to the catalysis of MMPC-Co. During the discharge process of electrode, an cathode electrolyte interface (CEI, ZnO and (Zn(OH)2)3(ZnSO4)(H2O)5 is formed as a protective layer on the surface, and ZnS is subsequently formed inside the cathode [46,47]. When the electrode is charged, ZnS first transforms gradually, and then the CEI gradually disappears. This is also confirmed by follow-up ex-situ XPS results. Fig. 5(b) shows the high-resolution spectra of S 2p of the S@MMPC-Co cathode in different states. The initial electrode (point a) exhibits a typical elemental sulfur S 2p spectrum around 164 eV. Once the electrode discharges to 1.16 V (point b), the sulfate signal appears at 169 eV. When the electrode continues to discharge to 0.48 V (point c), the sulfur signal becomes weaker, because more (Zn(OH)2)3(ZnSO4)(H2O)5 is formed on the surface to mask the sulfur signal. At the same time, the signal of the C 1s spectrum also weakens due to the increase of (Zn(OH)2)3(ZnSO4)(H2O)5 on the electrode surface (Fig. S20). As the discharge continues to 0.13 V (point d), the sulfate signal further increases. At the same time, a sulfide signal appears around 162 eV. When the electrode is placed at 0.05 V (point e), as the increase of discharge products, sulfide signal becomes obvious. When the electrode is charged to 0.95 V (point f), the signal of sulfide begins to weaken, but the signal of sulfate does not change, which indicates that sulfide is first oxidized during charging, causing the decrease of its content. After charging to 1.22 V (point g), the peak of sulfur begins to appear, but the signal is weak due to the small amount of formed sulfur. As the electrode voltage is placed at 1.6 V (point h), obvious sulfur signals are detected, and the sulfate signal almost disappears. However, there is still CEI on the surface to facilitate the next cycle, because the sulfate signal has not completely disappeared. In the O 1s fine spectrum, it is also observed that the O signal gradually shifts toward the direction of low binding energy as the discharge proceeds due to the formation of ZnO and (Zn(OH)2)3(ZnSO4)(H2O)5 (Fig. S21). Then during the charging, as these two species disappear, the O binding energy changes toward a higher binding energy. However, the O binding energy has not returned to the initial state, which also indicates that there is still CEI on the surface. This is also confirmed by the Zn 2p fine spectrum (Fig. S22). Fig. S23 shows that S@MMPC-Co has a stronger sulfur signal and a weaker sulfate signal than S@MMPC in the charged state after the rate test, evidencing that the former can promote sulfur conversion and inhibit the generation of irreversible SO4 2−. FESEM was used to observe the surface morphology of the cycled cathode. Fig. S24 shows the surface morphology of the initial S@MMPC and S@MMPC-Co cathodes, which have uniform and dense surfaces without obvious cracks. After cycling, obvious cracks appeared on the surface of the S@MMPC cathode (Fig. 5c). This is because MMPC has a small pore volume and cannot withstand the stress caused by the volume expansion of ZnS. In contrast, the surface of the S@MMPC-Co cathode maintains a uniform and dense morphology without cracks (Fig. 5d). This is attributed to the large pore volume of MMPC-Co, which effectively alleviates the stress caused by the volume expansion of ZnS, thereby maintaining the integrity of the electrode structure and inhibiting the pulverization of the electrode material. Some interesting phenomena were also observed on the surface of the Zn anode. In this work, Zn (S@MMPC) represents the Zn anode paired with the S@MMPC cathode and Zn (S@MMPC-Co) represents the Zn anode paired with the S@MMPC-Co cathode. As shown in Fig. S25, Zn5(OH6)(CO3)2 (JCPDS No. 72-1100) always exists on the Zn (S@MMPC-Co) surface during the charge–discharge process, which is related to EC in the electrolyte [48]. Fig. S26 shows XRD patterns of Zn anode after rate measurement. The diffraction peak of ZnCO3 (JCPDS No. 83-1765) appears in the Zn (S@MMPC) after rate measurement, while the diffraction peak of Zn5(OH6)(CO3)2 disappears. Although Zn (S@MMPC-Co) also has the diffraction peak of ZnCO3 (the signal of its peak intensity is weaker than the signal of S@MMPC), there is the diffraction peak of Zn5(OH6)(CO3)2, indicating that MMPC-Co can alleviate the degradation of SEI. In addition, the diffraction peak of ZnCO3 was also detected at the cathode, as shown in Fig. S27. The surface morphology of the Zn anode was also observed through FESEM, as shown in Fig. S28. The surface of the initial Zn anode is relatively smooth and has no cracks. The surface of the tested Zn (S@MMPC) is uneven and has huge cracks, which is related to the formation of ZnCO3. Although some lumpy objects appear on the tested Zn (S@MMPC-Co), the surface is relatively smooth without any huge cracks. Fig. S29 shows the C 1s spectrum of the Zn anode, in which Zn (S@MMPC) has a stronger signal of carbonate than Zn (S@MMPC-Co), indicating that it produces more ZnCO3. According to the above experimental results, the following conclusions can be inferred. During the operation of the Zn-S battery, a solid electrolyte interface layer (SEI, Zn5(OH6)(CO3)2) can be formed on the surface of the Zn anode, which inhibits the growth of Zn dendrites and side reactions [48]. The degradation of battery performance is related to the formation of ZnCO3 on the cathode and anode surface. Compared with MMPC, MMPC-Co can mitigate the degradation of the anode SEI, because after the rate test, there is still SEI on the surface of Zn (S@MMPC-Co), while there is no SEI on the surface of Zn (S@MMPC). To sum up, a mechanism diagram about the battery reaction is proposed, as shown in Fig. 5(e). During the electrochemical reaction process, an electrolyte interface protective layer can be formed on the surfaces of the cathode and anode. The anode SEI always exists and does not change with the charging and discharging conditions. The cathode CEI is reversible and changes as the charging-discharging status. Sulfur molecules react rapidly with zinc ions under the catalysis of single-atom Co to form ZnS, realizing a solid–solid transformation reaction, thereby restraining the generation of intermediate polysulfides and irreversible SO4 2−. 4 Conclusions In summary, this work reports a strategy to synthesize porous carbon materials derived from biomass waste, which not only can clean environment, but also combine inexpensive carbon with single-atom Co as a high-performance electrocatalyst for S cathode. The preparation method is facile through a multi-annealing process by mixing mangosteen peel with K3[Co(CN)6] and KOH, then washing and drying for the catalyst. When employing the product as sulfur host in room-temperature aqueous Zn-S batteries, MMPC-Co improves sulfur electron transport due to its good electrical conductivity. The single-atom cobalt catalyst accelerates the interface charge transfer for fast kinetics of the sulfur reduction reaction, realizing the rapid solid–solid transformation of S to ZnS, thereby restraining the generation of intermediate polysulfides and irreversible SO4 2−. Furthermore, the rich pore structure not only physically limits sulfur loss, but also accelerates the transport of zinc ions. In addition, the large pore volume of MMPC-Co is able to relieve the stress effect caused by the volume expansion of ZnS during charge/discharge cycles, thereby maintaining the stability of the electrode intact structure. Consequently, the as-assembled aqueous Zn-S battery exhibits a high capacity of 507.21 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1, and maintains a capacity of 729.96 mA h g−1 at 4 A g−1 even after 500 cycles. The S@MMPC-Co cathode-based Zn-S battery delivers super electrocatalytic performance, which is much better than most cathode materials reported in the literature. This work provides a new strategy for constructing high-performance aqueous Zn-S batteries at room temperature by constructing biomass-based single-atom materials, while holding great promise for their practical applications.

        "dc:description": "Aqueous zinc-sulfur batteries at room temperature hold great potential for next-generation energy storage technology due to their low cost, safety and high energy density. However, slow reaction kinetics and high activation energy at the sulfur cathode pose great challenges for the practical applications. Herein, biomass-derived carbon with single-atomic cobalt sites (MMPC-Co) is synthesized as the cathode in Zn-S batteries. The catalysis of single-atom Co sites greatly promotes the transform of cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) on the cathode surface, while offering accelerated charge transfer rate for high conversion reversibility and large electrochemical surface area (ECSA) for high electrocatalytic current. Furthermore, the rich pore structure not only physically limits sulfur loss, but also accelerates the transport of zinc ions. In addition, the large pore volume of MMPC-Co is able to relieve the stress effect caused by the volume expansion of ZnS during charge/discharge cycles, thereby maintaining the stability of electrode structure. Consequently, the sulfur cathode maintains a high specific capacity of 729.96 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 4 A g−1, which is much better than most cathode materials reported in the literature. This work provides new insights into the design and development of room-temperature aqueous Zn-S batteries.",
