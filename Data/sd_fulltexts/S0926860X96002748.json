Analytical results clearly showed the presence of Ca1 - x SrxTi i - y Ni ~.O perovskite structure, where Sr substituted all the Ca sites while Ni substituted the Ti sites in the range of y < 0.1. Among the catalysts tested, the compositions of x = y = 0.2 showed the highest activity. Either Ni species in the Ca0.8Sro.2Til_yNiyO perovskite structure or NiO originally separated from the perovskite structure during the preparation was in situ reduced to Ni metal during the CH4 oxidation. The Ni metal thus formed showed high activity for synthesis gas production, where Cao.sSro.2TiO3 perovskite has an important role as a cartier of the Ni catalyst. Three catalysts of the composition Cao.sSr0.2Til.oNi0.~O were then prepared by citrate, impregnation and mixing methods. The highest activity was obtained with the citrate, followed by the impregnation of Ni on Cao.sSr0.2TiO3 perovskite. The catalyst prepared by the mixing method afforded no perovskite, resulting in low activity. The amount of coke formation over the Ni catalysts after the reaction for 150 h was as follows: citrate < impregnation << Ni/y-A1203 as the comparison.

Introduction The partial oxidation of CH4 to synthesis gas is an established industrial process [1] which operates at high temperatures (> 1200) and high pressures (150 atm). Recently, an intensive study has been carried out on the catalytic partial oxidation of CH4 to synthesis gas [2-14]. This process has advantages over the conventional steam reforming of CH4 to make synthesis gas, as the latter process is highly endothermic and produces synthesis gas having a H2/CO ratio ~> 3. The partial oxidation of CH4, expected to afford synthesis gas having an H2/CO ratio of about 2, makes methanol synthesis an ideal follow-up process. Ashcroft and co-workers [2-4] reported that transition met- als, Ni, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir, and Pt supported on alumina were active in this reaction at temperatures of 775. Schmidt and co-workers [5-7] reported that platinum and rhodium surfaces in a metal-coated ceramic monolith afforded mostly U2 and CO with almost complete conversion of CH4 and 02 at a short residence time. Some transition metal oxides combined with alkaline earth or rare earth oxides, i.e. CoO-MgO, NiO-CaO, CoO-Yb203, or Ni/Yb203 were interest- ingly found to be active as the catalyst at low temperatures ( ~< 700, down to 300) and extremely high space velocities in the partial oxidation of CH4 to synthesis gas [8-11], but hot spots have been observed in the catalyst bed where the actual temperature was 300-850 higher than that reported [12-14]. Ni/A1203, a typical catalyst for the steam reforming, was studied for the partial oxidation of CH4 at temperatures > 700 [15]. This process was thought to involve first the oxidation of a part of CH4 to H20 and CO2, followed by the reforming reactions of CH4 with H20 and CO2. In the steam reforming of CH4 to synthesis gas, deactivation of supported metal catalysts by coke formation is a serious problem caused by fouling of the metal surface, blockage of catalyst pores and voids, and/or actual physical disintegration of the catalyst support [16]. Actually, in the industrial process, a large amount of steam was added in order to avoid coke formation. In the partial oxidation of CH4 to synthesis gas, coke formation over the catalyst frequently takes place, resulting in catalyst deactivation. Coke formation has been fre- quently ignored in the literature [2-15], except in the case of Claridge et al. [17], who observed that the relative rate of coke formation follows the order Ni > Pd >> Rh, Ru, Pt, Ir. Nickel catalysts are highly effective for partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas, but they are unsatisfactory with respect to coke formation. Audier et al. [ 18] clearly demonstrated that a significant amount of coke can be formed over the catalysts containing iron or nickel. High T. Hayakawa et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 391-410 393 dispersion of metal species over catalyst may reduce coke formation [16]. Slagtern and Olsbye [19] reported the in situ formation and high activity of metal species for synthesis gas production in LaMO3 (M = Rh, Ni or Co) perovskite system, where the perovskite structure decomposed during the reac- tion. The best system, LaRhO3, kept high activity for 120 h on stream at 800 and showed high dispersion of Rh metal, while both LaNiO3 and LaCoO3 were deactivated probably due to coke formation during the reaction. We have briefly reported the activity of Ca 1 - x SrxTi 1 -- y Ni yO in the oxidation of CH 4 to synthesis gas, where the Ni catalyst was prepared by the citrate method followed by the in situ reduction of perovskite-like precursors [20,21]. It is likely that Ca1 , SrxTiO3 perovskite and the citrate method are important for the sustainability of the Ni catalyst against coke formation [22]. From the industrial point of view, Ni is preferable as the active species compared to expensive precious metal such as Rh or Ru. This paper deals with the details of the activity of the (Ca, Sr)(Ti, Ni)O catalyst and its sustainability against coke formation in the partial oxida- tion of CH4 to synthesis gas. 2. Experimental The catalysts Cal_xSrxTil_yNiyO (x = 0-1.0 and y = 0-1.0) were prepared by the citrate method [23] as follows: an aqueous solution of reagent grade nickel nitrate, alkaline earth carbonates and titanium isopropoxide was treated with an excess amount of citric acid and ethylene glycol, evaporated at 80-90 to make a sol of organic metal complex. This was followed by two-step decomposition by heating at 200 for 5 h and 500 for 5 h, and finally calcination at 850 in air for 10 h. Moreover, three catalysts of the composition Ca0.8Sro2Ti~.oNi0.20 were prepared by citrate, impregnation and mixing meth- ods. The impregnation method for preparing Ni/Cao.sSro.zTiO3 was carried out as follows: the calculated amount of aqueous nickel nitrate was treated with an equimolar amount of citric acid and ethylene glycol, evaporated at 80-90 to make a viscous liquid, and then diluted with distilled water. The solution was then added into a suspension of the Ca0.sSro.zTiO3 perovskite in distilled water, which was previously prepared by the citrate method. The suspension was again evaporated at 80-90, and calcined at 850 in air for 5 h. The mixing method for preparing the mixed metal oxide was carried out by grinding a mixture of metal oxides followed by calcination at 850 or 1100 in air for 5 h. The catalysts are shown as Ni/Ca0.sSro.2TiO3 (cit.), Ni/Cao.sSro.zTiO3 (imp.) and Ca0.sSr0.2Til.0Ni0.20 (mix.) for citrate, impregnation and mixing, respectively. The Ni/y-A1203 catalyst, used for comparison, was prepared by the impregna- tion method as follows: the calculated amount of aqueous nickel nitrate was treated with an equimolar amount of citric acid and ethylene glycol, evaporated at 80-90 to make a viscous liquid, and then diluted with distilled water. The 394 T. Hayakawa et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 391-410 solution was then added into a suspension of \"y-A1203 (Sumitomo, NK-124). The suspension was again evaporated at 80-90, and calcined at 850 in air for 5 h. The amount of Ni was 11.5 wt.-% on T-AlzO3. The structure of the catalysts thus prepared was studied as follows: the powder X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) were recorded using MXP-18 (MAC) with Cu K ce radiation. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were obtained with a PHI-5000 spectrometer employing Mg Ka radiation (1253.6 eV) and an electron flood gun to provide charge neutralization of the non conducting samples. The surface area of the catalysts were measured by the BET method with a Micromeritics model 2200. Cal_~Sr~Ti0.8Ni0.20 showed a surface area between 0.7 and 8.3 m2/g, increasing with increase in the Sr content. Both Ca0.8Sr0.2Til_vNiyO and Ca0.sSr0.2Til.0Ni0.20 showed almost the same value at 1 m2/g. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Hitachi S-800) was used to study the overall microstructure of the catalyst particles. Transmission electron mi- croscopy (TEM; JEOL, JEM-2000FXII) was undertaken to study the microstruc- ture on a fine scale and identify coke formation over the catalyst. Analyses using energy dispersion spectroscopy (EDS, Phillips DX-4) were carried out by fixing a probe diameter at 1.0 nm. All the catalysts have been tested by using temperature programmed reaction (TPR) in a mixture of air (2.4 l/h) and CH4 (1.0 I/h, from Takachiho). The TPR was carried out by increasing the reaction temperature from room tempera- ture to 800 at the rate of 2.5/min. Moreover, the reactions for testing the catalyst life were carried out at 800 for 150 h under the same conditions. A U-shaped quartz reactor was used, with the catalyst bed near the bottom. 300 mg of catalyst was dispersed in 2 ml of quartz wool to avoid sintering and clogging of the reactor. The thermocouple was introduced at the top of the reactor, and placed in the middle of the catalyst bed. The produced gases were sampled immediately after the reactor and injected into a gas chromatograph for analysis. The selectivities to C2 compounds, CO2, CO and H2 were calculated based on the numbers of carbon and hydrogen atoms in CH4. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Structure of Ca1_ xSr~TiI- yNiyO We previously reported that the Cal_xSrxTil_yNiyO is not homogeneous, and Ni is not able to substitute the Ti sites to a large extent in the Ca~ _xSrxTiO3 perovskite structure [24]. Iwahara et al. [25] reported that the solid solution formation range is limited to y = 0.1 or less in CaTil_yNiyO3_~. XRD mea- surements of Cao.8Sro.2Ti~_yNiyO clearly showed the peaks of NiO (JCPDS: 22-1189) together with orthorhombic Ca0.8 Sro.2TiO3 perovskite(JCPDS: 42-423); NiO was separated from the perovskite structure even in a nickel content of y = 0.1 (Fig. 1). No significant shift but line broadening was observed in the T.

After the reaction, peaks of Ni metal appeared instead of the weakening of NiO peaks, suggesting a substantial reduction of NiO to Ni metal during the reaction. No change in the peaks of Ca0.8Sr0.2TiO3 suggests that the perovskite was stable during the reaction; only NiO was reduced to Ni metal. XRD analyses of Cal_xSrxTi0.8Ni0.20 clearly showed the peaks of NiO together with Cal_~SrxTiO3 perovskite: NiO was again separated from the perovskite structure (Fig. 2). Weak peaks of CaO (JCPDS: 37-1497) were also observed at a high concentration of Ca, while SrO was not detected even in SrTi0.8Nio.20. This may be due to an enhanced substitution of Ni for the Ti site in the Sr-rich perovskite since SrTiO3 possesses a highly stable structure. The crystal structure of CaTiO3 is orthorhombic [26], while SrTiO3 has a cubic structure which is the most symmetric and contains one formula unit per cell [27]. The peaks of the Cal_~SrxTiO3 perovskite were sharpened and shifted towards lower 2 0 angle, i.e., a higher d value, almost obeying the Vegard's law when x increased, due to the structure transition from orthorhombic CaTiO3 to cubic SrTiO3 without an intermediate tetragonal phase [24,27]. 3.2. CH4 oxidation over Ca1_ xSrxTil_ ~Ni,.O Oxidation of CH4 with air over Ca0.sSro.2Til_yNiyO was carried out and the results are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 3.

During the TPR, increasing the temperature from room temperature to 800, the total amount of carbon in the effluent gas, E C, showed no change, suggesting that no (or very little) coke formation took place.

After the reduction with CH4 (1.0 l/h) for 2 h at 800, the activity of the catalyst (y = 0.2) for synthesis gas formation was unchanged (Table 1). The catalyst (y = 0.4) showed similar results to that (y = 0.2). When the Ni content was low, i.e., y = 0-0.025, synthesis gas was not formed even after the catalysts were treated with CH4. It is likely that Ni species substituted for Ti site in the perovskite structure cannot be reduced easily and showed no activity for the reforming reaction. Only the catalyst with (y = 0.05) showed a substantial increase in the activity for synthesis gas formation after reduction with CH4. The selectivity to synthesis gas increased with increasing Ni content and reached an almost constant value at y >~ 0.2. Thus, it is likely that the active species for the synthesis gas formation is Ni metal formed by the reduction of NiO, which is separated from the perovskite structure. The ratio of Ni/Ti was hereafter fixed at 0.2/0.8. The CH4 oxidation activity increased by increasing x in Cal_xSrxTi0.8Ni0.20, and the catalyst (x = 1.0) completely substituted showed the highest activity for CH4 combustion (Fig. 5). This may be due to the higher substitution of Ni for Ti site in the Sr-rich perovskite as mentioned previously. The highest selectivity to synthesis gas was observed over the catalyst (x = 0.2) just after the reaction temperature reached 800 (Table 2). A high concentration of Ca in the catalyst was preferable for the formation of C2 compounds, which may be due to the basicity of the Ca component. Further, reaction at 800 for 30 min resulted in the selective formation of synthesis gas over all the catalysts used, among which the highest selectivity to synthesis gas was again observed with the catalyst (x = 0.2). ~C was almost constant in the reactions in Table 2, suggesting no (or very little) coke formation over the catalysts during the TPRs.

Cao.sSro.2Tio.8Nio.20 for synthesis gas formation suddenly appeared when the reaction temperature reached 800 (Fig. 4). The other Cat_xSrxTi0.sNi0.20 catalyst did not produce synthesis gas, but substantially catalyzed CH4 combus- tion just after the reaction temperature reached 800. In these cases, a reaction time of 10-30 min at 800 was required for modifying the catalyst suitable for synthesis gas formation (Table 2). Therefore, an easier reduction of NiO to Ni metal may occur in Cao.8Sro.2Tio.8Nio.20 compared to the other Cal_xSrxTio.sNio.20 catalysts. It was thus found that the Ni catalyst prepared from Cao.8Sro.2Tio.8Nio.2O showed the highest activity for synthesis gas forma- tion from CH4. 3.3. Structures of the Ni catalysts prepared by three different methods The Cao.sSro.2Tio.8Nio.20 was a mixture of CaO, Cao.sSro.2TiO3 and NiO (Figs. 1 and 2). CaO is frequently used for the oxidative coupling of CH4 [28] and can reasonably affect the CH4 oxidation results. In order to get a more precise view of the Ni catalyst by simplifying the system, the Cao.sSro.2Til.0Nio.20 composition has been chosen considering the stoichiom- etry of Cao.sSro.2TiO3 perovskite in the catalyst preparation. To confirm the effect of the perovskite structure, Cao.sSro.2Til.0Nio.20 catalysts were prepared by three different methods, i.e., citrate, impregnation and mixing methods, and are shown as Ni/Cao.8Sro.2TiO3 (cit.), Ni/Cao.sSro.2TiO3 (imp.) and Cao.sSro.2Ti ~.oNio.20 (mix.), respectively. In the mixing method, two calcination temperatures, 850 for 5 h and 1100 for 5 h, were applied in order to check the effect of growth of the perovskite structure during the calcination. XRD patterns of Ni/Cao.8Sro.2TiO3 (cit.) and Ni/Cao.8Sro.2TiO3 (imp.) are shown in Fig. 6. The peaks of orthorhombic Cao.sSro.2TiO3 perovskite and NiO 400 T.

After the TPR (b), the peaks of CaO and NiO were weakened, those of SrzTiO4 disappeared and new peaks of Ni metal and CaCO3 (JCPDS: 5-586) appeared, showing that NiO was partly reduced to Ni metal, the unstable SrzTiO4 was decomposed and CaO was converted to CaCO3 during the TPR. The partial reduction of NiO to Ni metal resulted in a marked contrast in the results obtained with the catalysts prepared by citrate and impregnation, where NiO was almost perfectly reduced to Ni metal. When the catalyst was prepared by calcining at 1100 for 5 h, CaTiO3 perovskite structure (JCPDS: 42-423) was more clearly observed (c) compared to that calcined at 850, suggesting the growth of Cao.sSro.2TiO3 structure during the heating process. After the testing (d), CaO and NiO were weakened and Ni metal appeared, also suggesting the partial reduction of NiO to Ni metal. By means of X-ray line broadening measurements, using the Scherrer equa- tion, d = KA//3cosO (K, constant which was taken as 0.9; A, wave length of the X-ray used; /3, broadening of spectral line chosen; 0, diffraction angle of the line considered; for these calculations the most intense peak (111) for Ni was chosen), the average particle sizes (d) of Ni metal in the catalysts after the testing are given in Table 3. Thus, the citrate method gave smaller particles of Ni metal, followed by impregnation, while mixing gave rather large sizes of Ni metal particles. 3.4. Activities of the Ni catalysts prepared by three different methods It may be assumed that the solubility of Ni on B sites in the lattice is lower in the conditions of testing than during calcination. The difference in solubility may lead to a fine distribution of Ni particles precipitated on the outer surface of the perovskite crystallites. The results of the CH4 oxidation over the three catalysts are shown in Fig. 8. The highest activity was obtained with Ni/Cao.sSro.2TiO3 (cit.), followed by Ni/Cao.sSro.2TiO3 (imp.). Ni/Cao.gSr0.2TiO3 (cit.) showed high activity just after the temperature reached 800, before the reduction with CH4 flow (1.0 l/h) for 2 h, suggesting an easy reduction of NiO to Ni metals, as previously observed with Cao.sSro.2Tio.sNio.20. 402 7\".

On the other hand, the activity of Ni/Cao.sSro.2TiO3 (imp.) increased after the reduction with CH4 and reached almost the same value as Ni/Ca0.8Sro.2TiO3 (cit.). Cao.8Sro.2Til.oNio.20 (mix.), calcined at 850 for 5 h and showed a high activity for CH4 combustion. Calcination at l l00 resulted in an increase in the activity for C2 compound formation. In the all reactions, was almost constant, except for Cao.8Sro.2Til.oNio.20 (mix.) calcined at ll00, which showed a decrease in the ~C value and a low activity for synthesis gas formation. It appears that the high activity of the present Ni catalyst for synthesis gas formation is due to the combination of Ni metal and the Cao.sSro.2TiO3 perovskite structure. 3.5. Distributions of Ni species in the catalysts prepared by three different methods In X-ray photoelectron spectra of the catalysts, Ni 2d peaks appeared at 852.7 eV (Ni and around 855.5 eV (Ni2+ and Ni3+) and the former peak was clearly enhanced after the TPR, suggesting the reduction of NiO to Ni metal during the CH4 oxidation. The compositions of metals were calculated from the spectra by using the method reported by Penn [29] and are shown in Fig. 9, where the amount of Ni was obtained by summing Ni Ni2+ and Ni3+. After the TPR, the reactor was cooled down in nitrogen atmosphere and the catalysts were exposed to air at room temperature prior to obtaining XPS. Surface of Ni metal over the catalyst was possibly oxidized. Therefore an exact evaluation of the surface state of Ni metal was difficult, and only total amount of Ni species over the catalyst was available.

Surface composition of metals on the Ni catalysts after the reaction. citrate method (Cao.sSro.2Tio.8Nio.20 and Cao.sSro.2Tio.95Nio.050) may have a homogeneous distribution of the metal species from the surface to the bulk since the metal compositions obtained showed no significant difference from the calculated value. The effects of the preparation method were checked over the three catalysts prepared by citrate, impregnation and mixing methods. Similar metal distribu- tions were observed between the impregnation and the citrate methods, except that a slightly higher Ni content was observed for the latter catalyst, contrary to our expectation; these distributions did not significantly change during the reaction. The catalyst prepared by the mixing showed a substantial increase in the Ca content, in contrast to a decrease in the both Ti and Ni contents. By calcining the catalyst at a high temperature (1100), the Ca content decreased with increasing B site atom content. These results coincided well with the partial reduction of NiO to Ni metal and the growth of the Cao.sSro.2TiO3 and Sr2TiO4 structures at high temperatures, observed in the XRD analyses of the catalysts prepared by the mixing method. This suggests a concentration of Ni species in the bulk of the catalyst prepared by mixing. NiO in the catalyst bulk cannot be reduced easily, resulting in the partial reduction of NiO to Ni. It is interesting that the citrate method gave the highest surface content of Ni species among the preparation methods tested. The catalytic activity for CH4 conversion may depend on the amount of Ni on the surface of the catalyst, as well as the surface properties. It is likely that Ni migrates to the surface of the catalyst particles during the calcination of the catalyst prepared by the citrate method.

The particle size of 10 /xm before testing (a) decreased to 1 /zm after testing (b), suggesting that the catalyst particles were pulverized during the CH4 oxidation. This may be due to the reduction of NiO to Ni metal: NiO was separated from the perovskite structure and may be located at the grain boundaries of the fine particles (1 /zm) as the binder before the TPR, and the catalyst grains (10 /zm) may break down to the fine particles due to disappear- ance of NiO as the binder after the TPR. On the other hand, SEM observation of the catalyst prepared by mixing suggests that the catalyst particles may be composed of tight agglomerates formed by the sintering of small particles of the metal oxides crystals, in which NiO cannot easily be reduced during TPR. Surface morphology changed after TPR, suggesting that only NiO species at the surface of the particles were reduced to Ni metals. It is most likely that the different behavior of Ni species prepared by the different methods strongly affects the catalytic activity. 3.6. Sustainability of the Nil Cao.sSro.eTiO~ catalysts Both the Ni/Cao.sSro.2TiO3 (cit.) and the Ni/Cao.sSro.2TiO3 (imp.) were tested for 150 h at 800 under a mixed gas flow of CH4 (1 l/h) and air (2.4 l/h) to test the catalyst life. Both the catalysts showed stable activity and the former catalyst gave a higher selectivity to synthesis gas than the latter (Figs. 11 and 12). Ni/y-A1203 was used for comparison and showed unstable activity; both selectivity and conversion oscillated periodically with a considerable time interval. At each oscillation the selectivity to synthesis gas decreased, while the complete oxidation to CO2 was accelerated (Fig. 13), which is further demon- strated in Fig. 14, where a sudden decrease in the value of EC is observed at each oscillation point, while both the Ni/Cao.8Sro.2TiO3 (cit.) and the T.

The instability of the Ni/y-A1203 catalyst is as expected when heavy coke formation takes place and partly blocks the reactor. After the reaction for 150 h, the reactor was cooled to room temperature in N2 gas flow. The catalyst was then treated in air (1.5 l/h) by increasing the temperature at 2.5/rain so as to measure the amount of coke formed over the catalyst during the CH4 oxidation.

On Ni/~/-A1203, the typical tubular carbon filaments (whisker carbon) with a small nickel particle at the end were observed [17]. On the other hand, no coke formation took place on the surfaces of Ni/Ca0.sSro.2TiO3 (imp.) and Ni/Ca0.8Sro.2TiO3 (cit.), where a significant growth of nickel particles, 40 and 60 nm diameter on the former and the latter catalysts, respectively, were observed after the reaction. Before the reaction, NiO particles were well dispersed on Ni/Ca0.sSr0.2TiO3 (cit.) and their average sizes were below 5 nm in diameter. It is likely that the perovskite particle as the support was composed of an agglomerate of small oval-shaped single crystals of Ca0.sSr0.2TiO3 ( = 100 5onrll Fig. 16.

Some substructures were observed in the single crystals in the Ni/Cao.sSro.2TiO3 (imp.) catalyst, while the crystals in the Ni/Cao.8Sro.2TiO3 (cit.) catalyst were apparently homogeneous. When the catalyst was prepared by the citrate method, Ni possibly substituted the Ti site in the perovskite structure. Actually EDS measurements showed that a small amount of nickel species is present in the crystals in the Ni/Cao.sSro.2TiO3 (cit.) catalyst. Moreover, tiny dark spots were observed in the field of the oval-shaped single crystal of the perovskite (Fig. 16c), suggesting the formation of finely dispersed Ni metal over the Ni/Cao.sSro.2TiO3 (cit.) catalyst. The citrate method thus gave high dispersion of Ni species over the Cao.8Sro.2TiO3 perovskite containing Ni species in the structure, resulting in a strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between Ni and the perovskite. This reflects the XPS observation of the high surface content of Ni species over the Ni/Cao.8Sro.2TiO3 (cit.) among the catalysts used, suggesting that the Ni species has a high dispersion over the catalyst surface. The easy reduction of Ni species over the Ni/Cao.sSro.2TiO3 (cit.) compared to that over the Ni/Cao.8Sro.2TiO3 (imp.) mentioned previously also suggests the presence of finer particles of Ni over the Ni/Cao.8Sro.2TiO3 (cit.). It is likely that both the high Ni dispersion and the SMSI contribute to the high activity as well as the high sustainability of the catalyst. As previously mentioned in the CH4 oxidation over Ni/A1203 catalyst [15], the present process is also thought to involve first the oxidation of part of CH4 to H20 and CO2, followed by the reforming reaction of CH4 with H20 and CO2. Therefore, the catalyst bed may be composed of two zones, the first zone is composed of NiO over the perovskite or Ni in the perovskite under the oxygen-rich atmosphere and the second is of Ni metal under the reducing atmosphere. Coke formation reasonably takes place over the Ni metal surface of the second zone and its rate strongly depends on the carrier of the Ni metal catalyst. It has been demonstrated that the Ni catalysts supported on (Ca,Sr)TiO3 are active for the cn4 oxidation to synthesis gas, among which the Ni/Cao.8Sro.2TiO3 (cit.) prepared by the citrate method from the perovskite precursor was the most effective. Coke formation over the Ni/Cao.8Sro.zTiO3 (cit.) was negligible, even after the reaction for 150 h, and this is important since Ni is abundant and cheap, and can be used in place of the expensive platinum group metals. 4. Conclusion A series of Cal_xSrxTil_yNiyO perovskite catalysts was prepared by the citrate method and used in the oxidation of CH4. In the series of Ca o.8Sro.2Til_ y NiyO, the catalysts containing Ni (y >~ 0. l) showed high activity for CH4 combustion around 600, which suddenly changed to synthesis gas T. Hayakawa et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 391-410 4(/9 formation at 800. In the case of Cal_xSrxTi0.sNi0.20, an increase in x resulted in a high activity for the CH4 combustion, and the highest selectivity to synthesis gas at 800 was obtained with the catalyst of x = 0.2. Under the conditions of synthesis gas formation, the catalyst bed was composed of two zones: the first catalyzed CH4 combustion under the oxygen-rich atmosphere and the second catalyzed CH4 reforming with H20 and CO2 under the oxygen-deficient atmosphere. Among the catalysts tested, Cao.sSro.2Tio.sNio.20 showed the highest selectivity for the synthesis gas formation. Either Ni species in the perovskite structure or NiO originally separated from the perovskite structure during the catalyst preparation was easily reduced to Ni metal under the oxygen-deficient atmosphere at high temperature, and the Ni metal thus formed in the second zone showed high activity for synthesis gas formation. The Ni catalyst prepared by impregnation over Cao.sSro.2TiO3 perovskite carrier showed activity, while that prepared by mixing and calcining metal oxides contained no perovskite structure and showed no activity. The Ni/y- A1203 catalyst used for comparison showed activity, but significant coke formation occurred resulting in the deactivation. In situ prepared Ni catalyst from the composition Cao.sSro.2Til.0Nio.2O showed no coke formation and the highest activity among the catalysts tested. It is thus likely that the Cao.sSro.2TiO3 perovskite structure has an important role as the carrier of the Ni catalyst for synthesis gas formation. Both the high sustainability and the high activity of the in situ prepared Ni catalyst may be due to the high Ni dispersion and a strong metal-support interaction between Ni and the Cao.sSro.2TiO3 perovskite. The high Ni dispersion can be formed by the following two possible mechanisms: ( 1 ) Ni included originally in the perovskite lattice is released together with St/Ca during the preparation, or (2) NiO originally separated from the perovskite structure can be reduced to Ni in the presence of Sr/Ca during the reaction. The composition of Cao.sSro.2TiO3 as the carrier may also have a certain importance from the point of view of structure transition from orthorhombic unit cell to cubic unit cell, thereby affecting the catalytic activity in the CH4 oxidation.

Tel.: (+81-298) 54-4450; fax: (+81-298) 54-4709 A series of mixed metal oxides of the compositions Ca1−x Sr x Ti1−y Ni y O (x = 0–1.0, y = 0–1.0) were prepared by the citrate method, and was tested for the oxidation of CH4 to synthesis gas. Analytical results clearly showed the presence of Ca1−x Sr x Ti1−y Ni y O perovskite structure, where Sr substituted all the Ca sites while Ni substituted the Ti sites in the range of y < 0.1. Among the catalysts tested, the compositions of x = y = 0.2 showed the highest activity. Either Ni species in the Ca0.8Sr0.2Ti1−y Ni y O perovskite structure or NiO originally separated from the perovskite structure during the preparation was in situ reduced to Ni metal during the CH4 oxidation. The Ni metal thus formed showed high activity for synthesis gas production, where Ca0.8Sr0.2TiO3 perovskite has an important role as a carrier of the Ni catalyst. Three catalysts of the composition Ca0.8Sr0.2Ti1.0Ni0.2O were then prepared by citrate, impregnation and mixing methods. The highest activity was obtained with the citrate, followed by the impregnation of Ni on Ca0.8Sr0.2TiO3 perovskite. The catalyst prepared by the mixing method afforded no perovskite, resulting in low activity. The amount of coke formation over the Ni catalysts after the reaction for 150 h was as follows: citrate < impregnation ⪡ Ni γ-Al2O3 as the comparison. Ca0.8Sr0.2TiO3 perovskite was effective as the carrier of the Ni catalyst for the partial oxidation of CH4 to synthesis gas. Ni/Ca0.8Sr0.2TiO3 prepared by the citrate method is the most sustainable against coke formation during the reaction. It is likely that the citrate method gave high Ni dispersion over the perovskite as well as strong metal-support interaction between Ni and the perovskite, resulting in both high activity and high sustainability against coke formation.
