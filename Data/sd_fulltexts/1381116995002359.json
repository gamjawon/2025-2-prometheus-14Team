Baudoul, A. Borcy, S. Mommerency, P. Vanderwegen, G. Jannes * lnstitut Meurice, Av. E. Gryzon, 1, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium Abstract The influence of water on the cyanide displacement reaction of l-chlorobutane and of 1-bromobutane has been studied. Kinetics of both reactions have been followed under homogeneous and transfer conditions. The influence of water on the reaction rate and on the relative molar conductivity of the 18-crown-6 ether-KCN complex has been measured. In the first reaction, water reduces the reactivity of cyanide anions by solvating them. In the second reaction, this negative effect is overcompensated by the positive influence of water on the transfer steps between solid and liquid phases.

Introduction The hydrogenation of saturated and unsatu- rated nitriles has already been proposed as a kinetic tool to characterise hydrogenation cata- lysts [1-3]. Some compounds, such as acetoni- trile, butyronitrile, adiponitrile or benzonitrile are used to characterise hydrogenation catalysts through their ability to form primary, secondary and tertiary amines. In another way, unsaturated nitriles like acrylonitrile, 2-butenonitrile and 3- butenonitrile are well-adapted to characterise hydrogenation catalysts through the study of the C= C double bond reduction. In the case of 3-butenonitrile, the double bond is not conjugated to the nitrile group and a * Corresponding author. particular hydrogenation mechanism has been proposed by Dallons et al. [3]. With the aim to determine if this mechanism is also operative in the case of other non-conjugated unsaturated nitriles, it is interesting to verify whether the substitution level and the position of the olefinic bond play any role in the hydrogenation. Hence, the study of the reduction of higher non-con- jugated unsaturated nitriles, such as isomeric pentenonitriles and 3,3-dimethyl-3-butenonitrile has been envisaged. Whereas 3-pentenonitrile is commercially available, the others must be syn- thesised. An easy way to prepare aliphatic nitriles starts from the corresponding acid and proceeds via dehydration of the amide. But the dehydra- tion step generally occurs at high temperature and, if we aim at obtaining a non-conjugated unsaturated nitrile, milder chemistry would be 1381-1169/96/$15.00 1996 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

A feasible way to prepare these ni- triles is the nucleophilic substitution of an halide in halogenoalkenes by a cyanide anion. How- ever, the formation of a homogeneous phase containing an inorganic salt and the organic reactant at high concentration is challenging. Phase transfer catalysis may be the solution. Starks and Liotta [4] describe different cyanide displacements using liquid-liquid phase transfer catalysis or solid-liquid phase transfer catalysis. Solid-liquid phase transfer catalysis is often preferred to liquid-liquid phase transfer cataly- sis, because the solvation of the reactive cyanide anion is lower in the first system. But some- times it is noted that (i) a different order in the halobutane reactivity is observed in comparison with the common order suggested by the litera- ture and that (ii) small amounts of water added to the mixture increases the reaction rate. Displacement reactions under phase transfer conditions may sometimes be very sensitive to the water present in the organic phase. In some cases, it is suggested to add small amounts of water in order to increase the reaction rate and the name omega phase was given to a new region of the reaction system where water coats the surface of the salt and extracts the crown from the organic phase [5,6]. This study attempts to give a better interpre- tation of the key role played by water by corre- lating the reaction rate with the concentration of water in the organic phase and by the study of the influence of water on the relative molar conductivity of the 18-crown-6 ether-KCN complex in an organic solution. This work also describes the kinetics of cyanide displacement of 1-chlorobutane and 1- bromobutane using 18-crown-6 ether as transfer agent with and without water addition to the reaction mixture. These halobutanes were chosen as model molecules of the more expensive bromoalkenes and chloroalkenes we intend to use for the synthesis of the desired unsaturated nitriles. We have verified that, as expected, the presence of a C=C double bond does not influence the reac- tion kinetics. 2. Experimental Reaction mixture (halobutane, potassium cyanide, catalyst and acetonitrile as solvent) was refluxed (acetonitrile b.p.: 81.6) in a two-necked flask fitted with a condenser and magnetic stirrer. All the reagents were labora- tory grade (acetonitrile: Janssen Chimica, 99%; potassium cyanide: Merck p.a., min. 97%; 1- chlorobutane: Aldrich, 99,9%; 1-bromobutane: Aldrich, 99%; 18-crown-6: Aldrich, 99%). Potassium cyanide was dried under vacuum at 80, crushed in a planetary mill and dried again before use. The water concentration was measured by the Karl-Fischer method. The concentrations of reactants were determined by gas chromatography (Hewlett Packard 5890, column: CP Wax 52 CB from Chrompack). Atomic absorption measurements were carried out with a Perkin Elmer E360 apparatus with an air/acetylene flame; potassium determination was made according to Vogel's standard method. Metrohm Konduktoskop E365 was used to mea- sure conductimetric data. Two sets of kinetic experiments were carried out. In the first (phase transfer experiments), an excess of potassium cyanide (10 g) was added to the reaction mixture (4 ml of 1-halobutane, 200 ml of acetonitrile and 1 g crown ether). In a second series (homogeneous experiments), reac- tion mixtures were derived from a saturated solution prepared in the following way: excess potassium cyanide, 10 g of crown ether and 500 ml of acetonitrile were refluxed for 2 h in a 1-1 flask. The solution was stirred overnight at room temperature. After filtering, the volume was adjusted to 500 ml. Starting from this stock solution, dilutions were made to obtain the cor- rect concentration and an equimolar amount of the co-reactant was added. Potassium concentration and water concentra- F.

Results and discussion 3.1. Mechanism Scheme 1 summarises all the equilibria coex- isting during the reaction. First, potassium cyanide is complexed by the crown ether (CE). The complex CE KCN then dissociates to pro- duce a free cyanide anion which can react with the organic reactant. The same equilibria appear with the potassium halide produced by the syn- thesis reaction. At equilibrium, the reaction yield depends on the solubility ratio of potassium cyanide to potassium halide. In a previous study [7], we have shown that at low crown ether concentration (0-0.02 M), all the transfer agent is complexed with cyanide g o o~ g~ o 0,2 0,15 0,1 0,05 I I n 100 150 Time (rain.) , Transfer l-bromobutane Transfer l-chlorobutane Homogeneous l-bromobutane Homogeneous l-ehlorobutane n b 0 50 200 250 Fig. 1.

K= [CE-K+] [CN-]/[CEKCN] = [CN-]2/[CE KCN] = 0.05 This value was determined by measuring the limiting molar conductivity. During the same study, we have concluded that the rate determin- ing step of 1-chlorobutane cyanation was the nucleophilic substitution itself. This fact was verified by the comparison of the kinetic con- stant of reactions conducted under both 'trans- fer' conditions and 'homogeneous' conditions. 3.2. Kinetic results 3.2.1. Comparison of the cyanation of 1-chloro- butane and 1-bromobutane. The kinetic results of cyanide displacement of 1-chlorobutane and 1-bromobutane under 'transfer' conditions and 'homogeneous' condi- tions are given in Fig. 1. For a 'homogeneous' reaction, the rate equation is: r = k[CN-] [ 1-halobutane] We know that under 'transfer' conditions, the cyanide anion concentration in the organic phase is constant, and determined by the crown ether concentration. Hence, the reaction rate expres- sion reduces to: r = kapp[ 1-halobutane] where kapp = k[CN-]. In the case of 1-chlorobutane, as previously mentioned [7], the true kinetic constants k are equal under 'homogeneous' and 'transfer' con- ditions. Hence, we may conclude that the reac- tion rate is not limited by the transfer of species at the solid-liquid interface. If we compare the results obtained with 1- bromobutane and 1-chlorobutane, it may be seen that under 'transfer' conditions, the reaction rate of the chloride is higher than that of the bro- mide. This confirms the observation done by Starks and Liotta in a similar experimental sys- tem. However, our experiments show a marked initial drop in the bromobutane concentration. This drop is nearly equal to the value of the crown ether concentration. After this initial drop, the concentration of the reactant linearly de- creases in time. This suggests an apparent zero order reaction rate in contrast with the results found in the case of 1-chlorobutane. Under 'ho- mogeneous' conditions, the rate diagram is clas- sical, and 1-bromobutane runs faster than 1- chlorobutane. Actually, the reaction is so fast 0,2 0,15 m 0,1 g 0 0,05 oOM 0,56 M 1,7 M o 3,4 M 4,5 M t 0 100 200 300 Time (min) Fig. 2.

The comparison with 1-chlorobutane is therefore im- possible. Consequently, in the case of the 1-bromobu- tane, under transfer conditions, the reaction seems to be limited by the transfer of species through the solid-liquid interface. 3.2.2. The influence of water Fig. 2 shows the influence of water on the kinetics of cyanide displacement of 1-chloro- butane. The addition of water clearly decreases the reaction rate as demonstrated by the compar- ison of the concentration-time curves at low or at high amount of added water.

Baudoul et al./Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 107 (1996) 351-358 unchanged and is still equal to 1. However, the effect of water is more important at low concen- tration than the effect of further water addition. Fig. 3 shows the dependence of the kinetic constant on the amount of water added to the mixture. In the concentration range of 0 to 1 M of added water, the value of the kinetic constant sharply decreases. At higher concentrations, the changes are much smaller and the value of the apparent rate constant approaches 0.04 min-l 1 mol- l In the case of 1-bromobutane (Fig. 4), higher water concentrations lead to higher reaction rates in the range of added water from 0 to 5 M. Moreover, the concentration-time curves look more like first order kinetics. From the above data, it is evident that water has an opposite effect on the two halides under- going the nucleophilic substitution. However, in both cases, with the same amount of added water, the catalytic system is similar and does not depend on the nature of the halide com- pound: the solvation level of cyanide anions and their ionisation constant are identical, but the reaction rates vary in opposite ways. Water has a deactivating effect on the reaction of 1-chloro- butane, and exhibits an activating effect for the bromo compound. 3.3. Water concentration in the organic phase In a first series of experiments, we have determined by the Karl-Fischer's method the concentration of water in the organic phase. The samples were prepared as for the kinetic experi- ments under transfer conditions. The results were compared to the results of experiments without crown ether in the system. Fig. 5 shows the concentration of water in the organic phase versus the amount of water added to the mix- ture. The general behaviour does not depend on the presence of transfer agent and we pointed out that three different zones (A, B, C) may be defined in the evolution of the water concentra- tion. In zone A (0-2 M of water), all the water goes into the organic phase. When the initial water concentration is increased (zone B, 2-5 M), the water concentration in the organic phase remains constant at about 2 M. In this zone, a solubility equilibrium is reached between a new aqueous phase and solid cyanide. The system is then triphasic: solid (KCN)-liquid (water satu- 6 L 0 ..= ~J L. .= 0 Solid-Liquid Zone A A ;im me I P Sofid-Liqui Zoni I I I I -Liquid B / / ( / i i\" Liquid-~iqul /Zone C I / / / /* /i g *lIi~v~hautC . plq ~m ~ i 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 he~ Wan- Oli~a.al~a (M) Fig. 5.

For an overall water concentration above 5 M (zone C), all the solid is solubilised in the water and the system is formed by two liquid phases only. The calcu- lated KCN concentration in the aqueous phase (45 g/100 ml H20) is close to KCN solubility (50 g/1 O0 ml). In a second series of experiments, we have measured the potassium concentration in the organic phase by flame AA spectroscopy and studied the effect of 18-crown-6 ether addition (Fig. 6). The general behaviour of the curves is similar to what was described above.

Crown ether is less effective probably because the transfer agent (dashed area) coats the surface of solid potassium cyanide. The last experiment (Fig. 7) shows the molar conductivity of the crown ether-KCN complex versus the concentration of water in the organic phase. The results clearly show a decrease in the molar conductivity on increasing water con- tent. This demonstrates the effect of solvation of the ions by water leading to a reduced mobility, in the same way as it leads to a decreased reactivity. In zone A, the added water completely goes in the organic phase. In this range (0-2 M), water realises the solvation of the cyanide an- ions and reduces their reactivity. Consequently, the reaction rate must decrease. This fact is observed using 1-chlorobutane as starting or- ganic compound (see Figs. 2 and 3). The de- crease of the value of the apparent rate constant kapp as a function of the amount of added water is m good agreement with the variation of the molar conductivity described in Fig. 7. In the case of the bromo compound, the same effect probably exists, but it is overcompensated by the influence of water on the transfer steps between solid and liquid phase. Work is under progress to distinguish between an effect on cyanide solubilisation or complexation, or an effect on bromide deposition. 4. Conclusions Synthesis of nitriles by cyanide displacement of chloroalkenes can be envisaged by solid- liquid phase transfer catalysis. Presence of wa- ter should be avoided as it reduces the reactivity of cyanide anions by solvation. When bromoalkanes or bromoalkenes are considered as starting material, 100% conver- sion will be very difficult to achieve, unless water is added in the system. Addition of suit- able amounts of water may realise an optimum between the negative effect of solvation and the positive effect water exerts on phase transfer. This optimum probably lies in using liquid- liquid phase transfer catalysis. References [1] J.L. Dallons, Ph.D. Thesis, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, 1986. [2] J.L. Dallons, G. Jannes and B.
