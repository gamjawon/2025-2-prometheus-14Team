In this study, density functional theory (DFT) was employed to model Ag4, Ag8, and Ag13 nanoparticle-supported g-C3N4 catalysts. The stability of the Ag4, Ag8, and Ag13 nanoparticle-supported g-C3N4 catalysts was rigorously confirmed, followed by the computation of electron density and differential charge density profiles. The adsorption configuration of CO2 on the catalyst surfaces was optimized, revealing that the adsorption process is predominantly governed by chemisorption. It was determined that the activation of this process is intricately linked to the electronic interactions between CO2 molecules and the catalyst surface. Furthermore, the study explored the mechanisms underlying the electrochemical reduction of CO2, with a focus on elucidating the production pathways of four key products: HCOOH, CO, CH3OH, and CH4, across the three catalysts. The free energy profiles along the reaction pathways were analyzed to compare the selectivity and catalytic activity of the three catalysts for various reduction products. Among the catalysts studied, the Ag4-supported g-C3N4 catalyst exhibited the highest selectivity for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to HCOOH. Additionally, the study demonstrated that an increase in the size of the Ag nanoparticles correlates with an enhanced selectivity for CO as a two-electron reduction product, while the catalytic activity for multi-electron reduction products such as HCOOH, CH3OH, and CH4 decreases. Band structure and density of states calculations for the three Ag nanoparticle-supported catalysts revealed an inverse correlation between band gap values and catalytic activity, with smaller band gaps associated with higher catalytic activity. This work provides critical insights into the relationship between Ag nanoparticle size and CO2 electrocatalytic reduction activity, offering a theoretical foundation for the design of advanced CO2 reduction catalysts.

This disruption of the carbon cycle in ecosystems is severely affecting the human living environment [1–4]. Converting excess carbon dioxide into valuable chemical fuels represents one of the most effective strategies to achieve carbon neutrality and mitigate environmental issues [5,6]. Researchers have proposed various methods for converting carbon dioxide into value-added compounds, including photocatalysis [7–10], thermal catalysis [11–13], and electrocatalysis [14–17]. Electrocatalysis is widely employed due to its straightforward operation and broad energy applicability [18,19]. In recent years, composite materials, including metal-carbon composites (e.g., graphene, g-C3N4) and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), have been extensively investigated as catalysts for CO2 reduction [20–25]. Among metal atoms, the d-shell element silver (Ag) has become a widely studied electrocatalytic material due to its relatively low overpotential and high selectivity towards reduction products. Lu et al. developed a nanosilver catalyst capable of selectively reducing carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide with an efficiency of 92% at a voltage of 0.6 V [26]. Yu et al. employed plasma technology to control the morphology of catalysts, thereby achieving efficient conversion of CO2 to CO [27]. Chen et al. synthesized Ag@C catalysts with electrocatalytic properties using a hydrothermal method and found them to be highly active [28]. Koshy et al. discovered that silver catalytic surfaces modified with ionically cross-linked polymers can regulate hydrogen evolution rates during carbon dioxide reduction [29]. Silver-copper nanodimers [30], along with other silver-containing catalytic materials, have also been investigated. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is a typical nitrogen-containing two-dimensional semiconductor characterized by its excellent thermal and chemical stability. It is a superior nitrogen-containing two-dimensional material. Sung et al. successfully synthesized CuO-derived electrocatalysts on g-C3N4 nanosheets, enabling the conversion of carbon dioxide into carbon-containing compounds such as CH4 [31]. Liu et al. developed hydrogenated silicon-doped g-C3N4 electrocatalysts that achieve efficient and selective CO2 conversion to CH4 [32]. Zhang et al. employed density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the catalytic performance of nickel (Ni) clusters supported on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4). They found that Nin@g-C3N4 clusters exhibit significant binding energies and enhanced conductivity, with the catalytic performance in CO2RR being influenced by the size of the doped Ni clusters. Among these, the Ni4@g-C3N4 catalyst demonstrated optimal efficiency in formic acid (HCOOH) production [33]. Ren et al. investigated a series of metal trimer clusters supported on g-C3N4 substrates, discovering effective adsorption and activation of CO2 on M3@g-C3N4, and selective CH4 generation on Cu3@g-C3N4 catalysts [34]. Through experimental and theoretical studies, Zhang et al. discovered that SnO2/g-C3N4 heterojunctions exhibit superior activity and stability for the CO2RR conversion to formic acid [35]. These studies collectively demonstrate that g-C3N4, as a catalyst support, exhibits excellent performance. Sastre et al. proposed a novel electrocatalyst by combining the excellent properties of silver-based catalysts and g-C3N4, formed by loading silver nanoclusters onto g-C3N4. This catalyst demonstrated strong activity and selectivity in the reduction of CO2 to CO and H2 in aqueous solutions [36]. Zhang et al. prepared a silver nanocluster composite catalyst using a hydrothermal decomposition method, with g-C3N4 as the carrier, from a silver oxide precursor. This catalyst can catalyze the reduction of CO2 to CO at a lower onset potential (190 mV) and exhibits high Faradaic efficiency. Ag4, Ag8, and Ag13 are among the commonly encountered stable silver clusters [37–42]. Li et al. investigated Ag2-loaded g-C3N4 electrocatalysts for the reduction of CO2. Experimental data and DFT calculations demonstrated that diatomic Ag sites can effectively adsorb CO2 and lower the barrier for *COOH formation [43]. Density functional theory studies revealed that Ag4 nanoclusters supported on γ-graphyne exhibit higher stability compared to Ag2 and Ag3 clusters, as determined by their band structure and density of states analysis [44]. Matuli et al. constructed Ag8 clusters with different electrical properties and established the varying adsorption strengths of NO based on their distinct symmetrical structures, thereby demonstrating the excellent adsorption capabilities of Ag8 clusters [45]. Zhang et al. prepared Au8 cluster-loaded carbon nitride catalysts and evaluated their performance in the electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 to CO [46]. Takesue et al. found that Ag13 clusters are most likely to aggregate, forming silver nanoparticles [47]. Through DFT calculations on the active sites of silver clusters, Zhang et al. predicted that CO2 tends to adsorb on the bridge sites of silver clusters, with CO being strongly adsorbed during catalysis, thereby favoring the production of CH3OH and CH4 [48]. Based on the aforementioned studies, this paper constructs three catalytic models (Ag4-C3N4, Ag8-C3N4, and Ag13-C3N4) with silver nanoparticles loaded onto g-C3N4. These models investigate the characteristics of catalysts and the electrocatalytic reduction mechanism of CO2, with the aim of providing theoretical foundations for optimizing and designing CO2 electrocatalysts. 2 Calculation methods This study optimized the stable structures of Ag4, Ag8, and Ag13 nanoparticles on g-C3N4, as illustrated in Fig. 1 . All structure optimizations, vibrational frequency calculations, and related tasks were performed using spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) and the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) [49]. Projector-augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials were employed to describe the ion cores [50]. This study employed the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional within the framework of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [51,52]. The Brillouin zone was sampled at 3 × 3 × 1 k-points, and the plane-wave cutoff energy was set to 450 eV after testing. Electronic energy and forces were converged to 10-4 eV and 0.01 eV/Å, respectively [53]. The influence of water was considered using the implicit solvent model in VASP [54]. Van der Waals interactions between adsorbates and substrates were corrected using the semi-empirical DFT-D2 correction in the Grimme scheme [55]. All structures were based on a 2 × 2 × 1 supercell of g-C3N4 with silver clusters loaded onto it. To prevent interactions between periodic images, a vacuum layer of 20 Å was applied in the computational models [56]. In the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2, the Gibbs free energy change for each reaction step is crucial in determining spontaneity. The calculation expression for the Gibbs free energy change for each step of the reaction is as follows: G = EDFT + EZPE - TS + ∫CPdT + GpH In this formula, EDFT represents the energy output from DFT calculation, EZPE denotes the zero-point energy of the reaction, S is the thermodynamic entropy, and T represents the temperature, which is 298.15 K under standard conditions. EZPE and S can be obtained by calculating the vibrational frequency of the adsorbed intermediate. The entropy S of the gas molecules can also be obtained from the NIST database. ∫CPdT represents the vibrational thermodynamic enthalpy H from 0 to T K, and GpH is the pH correction to the free energy, calculated as GpH = kBT × ln10 × pH (kB stands for Boltzmann's constant) [57]. The calculation methods related to the stability of reaction intermediate in the electrocatalytic process derived from Nørskov's research [58,59]. The calculation of the electrocatalytic Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) refers to computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model, and its expression is as follows: H + + e − ⇌ 1 2 H 2 ( g ) Δ G = 0 eV In the CHE model, when comparing reversible hydrogen electrodes at different pH values, the reaction reaches equilibrium when the electrode potential is 0 V, i.e., ΔG = 0 eV. Therefore, when calculating the free energy of a specific reaction, the free energy of 1 2 H2 can be used to replace H+ + e-, that is, the reaction *X + 1 2 H2(g) = *XH can be used to replace the reaction *X + H+ + e- = *XH. (* denotes surface adsorption sites) During the adsorption process, due to the decrease in molecular velocity, a portion of energy is released, termed adsorption energy (Eads), which can be calculated as follows: Eads = Etotal - Eslab - Ead In the formula, Etotal, Eslab and Ead represent the total energy of the adsorbed substance adsorbed on the surface, the energy of the surface adsorbed alone and the energy of the adsorbed substance. Typically, the adsorption energy is negative, and the greater its absolute value, the stronger the adsorption effect and the higher the stability of the adsorption system [60]. To confirm the stability of the catalysts, we calculated the binding energies (Eb) of Ag4-C3N4, Ag8-C3N4, and Ag13-C3N4. The binding energy (Eb) is calculated as: Eb = E(Agn-C3N4) – E(g-C3N4) – E(Agn) Here, E(Agn-C3N4) denotes the total energy of silver nanoparticles anchored to g-C3N4, and E(g-C3N4) and E(Agn) (n = 4, 8, 13) indicate the energies of nitrogen-doped carbon and silver nanoparticles, respectively. Additionally, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were conducted to confirm the structural stability of the three catalysts, with energy and temperature profiles for Ag4-C3N4, Ag8-C3N4, and Ag13-C3N4 presented in Figure S1. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Silver nanoparticle loaded g-C3N4 catalyst structure The carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) atoms in the two-dimensional material g-C3N4 hybridize into sp2 configurations, forming highly delocalized π-conjugated systems, that are well-suited for semiconductor band edge positions. We optimized three stable catalytic models with Ag4, Ag8, and Ag13 nanoparticles loaded onto g-C3N4, as illustrated in Fig. 2 . In the stable structure of Ag4-C3N4, Ag4 nanoparticles aggregate into a rhomboidal shape (initially configured as a tetrahedral structure). The distance between the nearest neighboring silver atoms is 2.65 Å, while between farther silver atoms it is 2.69 Å, resembling structures studied by Chen et al. [37]. In Ag8-C3N4, the distances between silver atoms range from 2.75 Å to 2.90 Å, with two silver atoms being closest to g-C3N4 at the lower end of the nanoparticle. The distances between the nearest two silver atoms and nitrogen atoms are 2.51 Å and 2.36 Å, respectively. In Ag13-C3N4, the Ag13 nanoparticles adopt a stable structure resembling a centered icosahedron when loaded onto g-C3N4. The distance between Ag atoms is approximately 3.0 Å, with the nearest Ag atom on the bottom surface of the nanoparticle to g-C3N4 being 2.27 Å. The binding energies(Eb) of Ag4, Ag8, and Ag13 nanoparticles loaded onto g-C3N4 are -1.68 eV, -1.96 eV, and -2.36 eV, respectively, Furthermore, AIMD calculation results show that the temperature and energy of the three catalysts remain stable during the dynamic simulation, confirming the dynamical stability of Agn-C3N4 (n=4, 8, 13), as presented in Figure S1.We also calculated the electron density and differential charge density maps for Ag4, Ag8, and Ag13 nanoparticles loaded onto g-C3N4 catalysts, as illustrated in Fig. 3 . It can be observed that charge transfer and electron cloud overlap occur between Ag4, Ag8, Ag13 and the g-C3N4 substrate, indicating strong electronic interactions between the metal nanoparticles and the substrate. This enhancement improves both the stability of the catalyst and its electrocatalytic performance. 3.2 Adsorption of CO2 on the catalyst surface Experimental studies by Liang et al. indicate that CO2 hydrogenation generally follows the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) mechanism when both *CO2 and *H are adsorbed on the catalyst surface. In contrast, the Eley-Rideal (ER) mechanism is more likely when gas molecules interact with pre-adsorbed species.[61–63] In this study, the adsorption energies (Eads) for *CO2 and *H on Ag4-C3N4, Ag8-C3N4, and Ag13-C3N4 are -0.19, -0.71, -0.11 eV and -2.24, -2.94, -3.10 eV, respectively. The substantial difference in Eads values between *CO2 and *H indicates that the ER mechanism is likely to be operative when CO2 adsorbs onto the catalyst. We first investigated the adsorption process of CO2 molecules on the catalyst surface, a crucial step for CO2 activation. A significant hallmark of this process is the geometric transformation of CO2 from a linear to a bent V-shaped structure (∠OCO bond angle less than 180°). Adsorption energies of CO2 on different catalysts were calculated for various adsorption sites, with the most stable adsorption configurations on Ag4-C3N4, Ag8-C3N4, and Ag13-C3N4 shown in Table 1 . Additional adsorption sites are listed in Table S1. In Table 1, Ead denotes the adsorption energy of CO2 on the catalyst surface, along with the corresponding changes in the CO2 molecular bond angles. In the Ag4-C3N4 adsorption model, CO2 adsorbs above the Ag4 nanoparticle on the catalyst surface exhibiting an adsorption energy of -0.19 eV. During the activation process of CO2 on the catalyst surface, the bond angle changes from a linear 180° to a bent 177.8° V-shape. The distance between the C atom of CO2 and the Ag atom is 3.36 Å, while the closest O atom to the Ag atom is at a distance of 2.90 Å. In the most stable adsorption configuration on Ag8-C3N4, CO2 adsorbs onto the surface of the Ag8 nanoparticle catalyst, exhibiting an adsorption energy of -0.71 eV. During the activation process of CO2 on the catalyst surface, the bond angle of the CO2 molecule changes from a linear 180° to a bent 169.1°. The distance between the C atom of CO2 and the Ag atom is 2.67 Å, while the closest O atom to the Ag atom is 3.03 Å away. Posada-Pérez et al. have also investigated catalysts with single-atom Ag loaded onto g-C3N4 [64]. For Ag13-C3N4, the most stable adsorption configuration differs from Ag4-C3N4 and Ag8-C3N4. CO2 adsorbs on the side of the Ag13 nanoparticle (after comparing multiple adsorption sites, including top and side adsorptions, similar to the other optimized configurations of Ag13-C3N4 adsorption positions do not converge), with an adsorption energy of -0.11 eV. The geometric configuration of the CO2 molecule also changes, with the ∠OCO bond angle bending from a linear 180° to 178.4°. The distance between the C atom of CO2 and the Ag atom is 3.52 Å, while the closest O atom to the Ag atom is 3.19 Å away. The optimal adsorption energies of CO2 on Ag4-C3N4, Ag8-C3N4, and Ag13-C3N4 were calculated to be -0.19 eV, -0.71 eV, and -0.11 eV, respectively, with corresponding O-C-O bond angles of 177.8°, 169.1°, and 178.4°. These variations in adsorption energies and bond angles are consistent with previous studies [61,63]. Additionally, the negative adsorption energies confirm that the adsorption processes on all three catalysts are thermodynamically favorable. CO2 does not form a bond with Ag4-C3N4 or Ag13-C3N4; instead, an oxygen atom from CO2 tends to approach the silver cluster, leading to physical adsorption. In contrast, Ag8-C3N4 forms a bond with the carbon atom in CO2, resulting in chemical adsorption [65]. CO2 exhibits a higher adsorption energy on Ag8-C3N4, indicating a more pronounced activation process on this surface. In three adsorption models, the CO2 bond angle changes noticeably from linear to a bent V-shape. This indicates that there is electron transfer between CO2 and Agn-C3N4, allowing it to stably adsorb on g-C3N4. 3.3 Reduction of CO2 to CO and HCOOH CO and HCOOH are the major carbon-containing compounds produced in CO2RR, representing its two-electron reduction products. Their formation involves adsorbed CO2 (*CO2, where * denotes the catalyst adsorption surface) undergoing a two-step proton transfer process. In this process, first, CO2 molecules are adsorbed and activated on the catalyst surface. The adsorbed CO2 captures an electron (e-) and combines with a proton (H+), forming intermediate species COOH or OCHO, which remain adsorbed on the catalyst surface (denoted as *COOH or *OCHO). Concurrently, we computed the desorption energies (Edes) of the optimal adsorption sites for *COOH and *OCHO on three distinct catalysts. The desorption energies for *COOH on Ag4-C3N4, Ag8-C3N4, and Ag13-C3N4 were determined to be 2.02 eV, 1.99 eV, and 2.44 eV, respectively, whereas the Edes for *OCHO were found to be 2.66 eV, 3.44 eV, and 2.71 eV, respectively. The elevated desorption energies suggest that *COOH and *OCHO are not readily detached from the catalyst and can undergo stable reactions at the optimal adsorption sites. The difference in the formation of the intermediates COOH and OCHO stems from the initial adsorption configuration of carbon dioxide. When the carbon (C) atom in CO2 accepts a proton attack, the intermediate *OCHO is formed, whereas when the oxygen (O) atom accepts a proton attack, the intermediate *COOH is formed. In this process, due to the change in the inert structure of CO2, the reaction is thermodynamically non-spontaneous. COOH or OCHO further captures an electron (e-) and combines with a proton (H+), forming adsorbed CO and HCOOH (denoted as *HCOOH or *CO). Finally, *CO and *HCOOH desorb from the catalyst surface to yield CO and HCOOH molecules. Therefore, the formation and dissociation of *HCOOH are crucial steps for the generation of various organic products on the silver surface. [66,67] In this study, the free energies required for the hydrogenation of CO2 to *COOH on Ag4-C3N4, Ag8-C3N4, and Ag13-C3N4 are -0.33 eV, -0.63 eV, and -0.44 eV, respectively, while the free energies for its hydrogenation to *OCHO are 0.27 eV, -0.11 eV, and -0.19 eV, respectively. These results show that the free energy required to form *COOH is significantly lower than that required for *OCHO formation, indicating that the initial hydrogenation step of CO2 is more favorable for *COOH production. This is consistent with the findings of Li et al. [43] The adsorption intermediate configurations for CO2 reduction to HCOOH and CO on Ag4-C3N4, Ag8-C3N4, and Ag13-C3N4 surfaces have been optimized. The free energy changes for each step of the intermediate on the catalyst surface are listed in Table 2 , whereas the adsorption configurations and energies are detailed in Table S2. The free energy changes for surface catalytic reactions on Ag4-C3N4, Ag8-C3N4, and Ag13-C3N4 are presented in Figures S2, S3, and S4, respectively. The horizontal axis represents the number of proton and electron transfers for each intermediate, whereas the vertical axis represents the free energy change of the reaction intermediates relative to the initial CO2. On the Ag4-C3N4 catalyst surface, CO2 undergoes adsorption and activation initially combining with a proton and an electron to form two different intermediates, *COOH or *OCHO. Due to structural changes in the linear CO2 during adsorption activation, the Gibbs free energies for generating these intermediates are -0.33 eV and 0.27 eV, respectively. Analysis from Table 2 indicates that for Ag4-C3N4, the free energy for forming *OCHO is positive, suggesting a higher reaction energy barrier, whereas the free energy change for the reaction *CO2 + H+ + e- → *COOH is negative, indicating a high degree of spontaneity in the reaction process. Formation of HCOOH can be obtained through two pathways: CO2 → *CO2 → *COOH → *HCOOH →HCOOH or CO2 → *CO2 → *OCHO → *HCOOH → HCOOH. In the *OCHO intermediate configuration, the C and O atoms of *OCHO are adsorbed above Ag4 nanoparticles, with an O to Ag distance of 2.65 Å. In the adsorption configuration of the *COOH intermediate, the C atom is 2.49 Å away from the Ag atom, and the O atom is 2.72 Å away from the Ag atom. *COOH further captures an electron and a proton to form *HCOOH molecules, with a free energy change of 0.28 eV for this process. *OCHO further captures an electron and a proton to form *HCOOH molecules, with a free energy change of -0.32 eV for this process. This indicates that the main pathway for generating HCOOH is CO2 → *CO2 → *OCHO → *HCOOH → HCOOH. *HCOOH desorbs from the catalytic surface, which is the rate-determining step of the entire reaction, with a free energy change of 0.66 eV. In contrast to the formation of HCOOH, the production of CO proceeds exclusively via the pathway CO2 → *CO2 → *COOH → *CO → CO. During the proton and electron transfer process, the hydroxyl oxygen of *COOH binds with a proton, resulting in the cleavage of the carbon-oxygen bond to form *CO and H2O. This process involves a free energy change is 0.36 eV. The desorption of CO from the catalyst surface is the rate-determining step for CO generation, involving a free energy change of 0.80 eV. Zhang et al. conducted a parallel study on Ni4-C3N4, finding that the formation of HCOOH and CO requires significantly higher energies of 0.84 eV and 1.46 eV, respectively [33]. Evidently, Ag4-C3N4 demonstrates a distinct advantage over Ni4-C3N4 in catalyzing the reduction of CO2 to HCOOH and CO. The desorption process has a high energy barrier, indicating that *CO is an crucial intermediate for the catalytic conversion of CO2 into multi-carbon organic compounds [68,69]. Ag8-C3N4 and Ag13-C3N4 follow the same mechanistic pathways for electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to HCOOH and CO. On the Ag8-C3N4 surface, the primary pathway for HCOOH generation proceeds via CO2 → *CO2 → *OCHO → *HCOOH → HCOOH. The desorption of HCOOH from the catalytic surface is the rate-determining step of the entire reaction, involving a free energy change of 0.88 eV. On the Ag13-C3N4 surface, the primary pathway for HCOOH generation involves CO2 → *CO2 → *OCHO → *HCOOH → HCOOH. The desorption of HCOOH from the catalytic surface is the rate-determining step of the entire reaction, with a free energy change of 0.73 eV. On the Ag8-C3N4 surface, the mechanism for CO generation proceeds as CO2 → *CO2 → *COOH → *CO → CO. The desorption process of CO from the catalyst surface is the rate-determining step for CO production, involving a free energy change of 0.69 eV. On the Ag13-C3N4 surface, the desorption energy of CO is 0.62 eV. From the reaction barriers on three different catalysts, Ag4-C3N4, Ag8-C3N4, and Ag13-C3N4, it is observed that as the nanoparticle size increases, the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO becomes more active. Zhang et al. developed a composite catalyst using g-C3N4 as a support for silver nanoparticles. This catalyst facilitates CO production from CO2 at lower onset potentials, further validating the high selectivity of Ag nanoparticles for CO generation [70]. 3.4 The process of CO2 reduction to CH3OH CH3OH is the six-electron reduction product of CO2. The conversion of CO2 to CH3OH involves six elementary reaction steps, each entailing transfer of a proton-electron pair (H+/e-). We have optimized the stable configurations, free energy changes, and adsorption energies of each adsorbed intermediate in the CO2 reduction to CH3OH pathway on the surfaces of Ag4-C3N4, Ag8-C3N4, and Ag13-C3N4, as detailed in Table 2 and Table S2. The free energy changes of the catalytic reactions on the surfaces of the three catalysts are shown in Figures S2, S3, and S4. During the reduction process of methanol, the first two reduction steps are analogous to those involved in *HCOOH and *CO. In the third reduction step, *CO adsorbed on the catalyst surface captures additional electrons and protons, forming intermediates *COH or *CHO. The free energy of *COH on Ag4-C3N4, Ag8-C3N4, and Ag13-C3N4 is 0.98 eV, 1.09 eV, and 1.14 eV, respectively, while for the further hydrogenation of *CO to form *CHO, the free energy is 0.61 eV, 0.79 eV, and 0.91 eV, respectively, on these catalysts. *HCOOH can accept a proton and an electron to form either *CHO or *OCH2OH.[63] The free energy needed to form *CHO from *HCOOH is 0.69 eV, 0.90 eV, and 0.96 eV on Ag4-C3N4, Ag8-C3N4, and Ag13-C3N4, respectively, while for *OCH2OH formation on these catalysts, it is 0.75 eV, 0.97 eV, and 1.07 eV, respectively. Based on free energy values, the energy barrier for forming *OCH2OH from *HCOOH is higher than that for *CHO, indicating that *CHO formation is more favorable. Consequently, *CHO is the predominant product of the three-electron reduction. On the Ag4-C3N4 surface, the free energy changes for the formation of *CHO from *HCOOH and *CO are 0.69 eV and 0.61 eV, respectively. *CHO is an important intermediate in CRR (*CO2 reduction reaction), adsorbing on the side of Ag4 nanoparticles with a C-to-Ag atom distance distance of 2.26 Å and an adsorption energy of -2.44 eV. *CHO can further capture an electron and combine with a proton on either the oxygen or carbon atom to form *CHOH or *CH2O, with respective free energy changes of -0.33 eV and -0.28 eV. When a proton and electron attack the O atom, *CH2O is formed, whereas if the C atom of *CHO accepts a proton and electron, the *CHOH intermediate is produced. The adsorption energies of *CH2O and *CHOH are very similar. *CHOH and *CH2O are both four-electron reduction intermediates in the CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) process, capable of further reduction. Specifically, *CHOH is exclusively reduced to *CH2OH, with a free energy change of 0.81 eV, indicating an endothermic process requiring higher energy input. In contrast, *CH2O can be reduced to either *CH2OH or *OCH3, with free energy changes of 0.76 eV and -0.54 eV, respectively. The formation of *OCH3 is exothermic and can proceed spontaneously. *CH2OH and *OCH3 serve as five-electron reduction intermediates in the CRR. *CH2OH and *OCH3 can further capture an electron and combine with a proton on either a C or O atom to form methanol molecules. This process involves the sixth electron and proton transfer in the CRR. The free energy changes for the conversion of *CH2OH and *OCH3 to *CH3OH are -0.58 eV and 0.72 eV, respectively. Comparing the reaction free energy changes, the generation of CH3OH on Ag4-C3N4 follows the pathway: CO2 → *CO2 → *COOH → *CO → *CHO → *CH2O → *OCH3 → CH3OH. Among these steps, the reaction *OCH3 + H+ + e- → * + CH3OH is the rate-determining step for CH3OH production, involving a free energy change of 0.72 eV. On the surfaces of Ag8-C3N4 and Ag13-C3N4, the mechanism for CO2 electrocatalytic reduction to CH3OH is identical to that on Ag4-C3N4: CO2 → *CO2 → *COOH → *CO → *CHO → *CH2O → *OCH3 → CH3OH. The reaction *CO + H+ + e- → *CHO serves as the rate-determining step for CH3OH production, with respective free energy changes of 0.79 eV and 0.91 eV. As the size of Ag nanoparticles increases, the activity for CO2 electrocatalytic reduction to CH3OH decreases. 3.5 CO2 reduction to CH4 process The conversion of CO2 to CH4 involves eight elementary steps, each entailing the transfer of a proton-electron pair (H+/e-). We optimized the configurations of intermediates in the CO2 reduction to CH4 pathway on the surfaces of Ag4-C3N4, Ag8-C3N4, and Ag13-C3N4. The free energy changes of each intermediate at every reaction step on the catalyst surfaces are listed in Table 2, whereas the adsorption configurations and energies are detailed in Table S2. The free energy changes of catalytic reactions on the surfaces of Ag4-C3N4, Ag8-C3N4, and Ag13-C3N4 are illustrated in Figures S2, S3, and S4.The first five reduction steps for CH4 production are identical to those for CH3OH, up to the formation of the five-electron reduction intermediates *OCH3 or *CH2OH. From this point, methane (CH4) production can proceed via two distinct pathways. One of these pathways begins with the intermediate *CH3O, following the reaction sequence: *CH3O → CH4 + *O → *OH → H2O. In this pathway, *CH3O first captures an electron and combines with a proton to form a six-electron reduction intermediate. If at this point the proton combines with oxygen, a molecule of methanol (CH3OH) is obtained, a process that has already been discussed in the context of CH3OH production. On the surface of Ag4-C3N4, after *CH3O captures an electron, the proton no longer combines with oxygen but with carbon instead. Simultaneously, the C-O bond breaks, and the generated CH4 quickly leaves the catalytic surface, leaving behind an O atom adsorbed on the catalyst surface (denoted as *O) to continue the subsequent reduction process. The free energy change for this process is -0.31 eV. *O as a six-electron reduction intermediate stably adsorbs above Ag4, with O atoms positioned at distances of 2.33 Å and 2.60 Å from the nearest Ag atoms on the nanoparticle surface. The adsorption energy is -2.77 eV. *O can further capture an electron and a proton to form *OH, eventually being reduced to H2O. In the process from *O to H2O generation, two protonation and electron transfer steps are required (*O → *OH → H2O), with free energy changes of -0.15 eV and 0.84 eV, respectively. If we take the adsorbed intermediate *CH2OH as the starting point, the process of *CH2OH → *CH2 → *CH3 → *CH4 differs from the generation of methanol. After *CH2OH captures an electron, unlike in the methanol generation process, the proton combines with oxygen instead of carbon, simultaneously breaking the C-O bond and releasing a water molecule from the catalytic surface. The intermediate CH2 then adsorbs onto the catalyst surface (denoted as *CH2), with a free energy change of 0.37 eV in this process. Compared to other single-atom catalysts, the silver nanoparticle-loaded g-C3N4 exhibits the lowest C-O bond-breaking energy barrier [71], suggesting enhanced catalytic activity favorable for CH4 production. Subsequently, *CH2 undergoes a protonation and electron transfer process to form the seven-electron reduction intermediate *CH3, with a free energy change of -0.46 eV in this step. *CH3 then captures a proton and electron to form CH4, with a free energy change of -0.83 eV in this final step. Energy analysis reveals that on Ag4-C3N4, the pathway for CH4 generation is CO2 → *CO2 → *COOH → *CO → *CHO → *CH2O → *CH2OH → *CH2 → *CH3 → CH4. The rate-determining step for CH4 production is *CH2O + H+ + e- → *CH2OH, with a free energy change of 0.76 eV. On the surfaces of Ag8-C3N4 catalysts, the mechanism for CO2 electrocatalytic reduction to CH4 is identical to that on Ag4-C3N4, with the pathway for CH4 production being CO2 → *CO2 → *COOH → *CO → *CHO → *CH2O → *CH2OH → *CH2 → *CH3 → CH4. The rate-determining step for CH4 generation is *CO + H+ + e- → *CHO, with a free energy change of 0.79 eV, consistent with the rate-determining step proposed by Yan et al. for CO2 reduction on Cu-C3N4 [72]. On the surface of Ag13-C3N4, based on the energy barrier analysis of each elementary step in Table 2, the pathway for CH4 generation is CO2 → *CO2 → *COOH → *CO → *CHO → *CH2O → *OCH3 → *O → *OH → CH4. The rate-determining step for CH4 production is *CO + H+ + e- → *CHO, with a free energy change of 0.91 eV. As the size of Ag nanoparticles increases, the activity for CO2 electrocatalytic reduction to CH4 decreases. 3.6 CRR product selectivity and catalyst performance analysis The limiting potential (UL) is defined as the maximum free energy change along the lowest free energy reaction pathway, ensuring a downhill energy difference for each step. We summarized the limiting potentials (UL) for the CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) producing four C1 products on Ag4-C3N4, Ag8-C3N4, and Ag13-C3N4 catalysts, as shown in Table 3 . On the surface of Ag4-C3N4, the rate-determining step for the generation of CO is the desorption process, involving a free energy change of 0.80 eV. For the generation of HCOOH, the desorption process is the rate-determining step for the entire reaction, involving a free energy change of 0.66 eV. Both are two-electron reduction products of the CO2 reduction reaction (CRR). Compared to CO, the desorption of HCOOH is much easier, thereby enhancing the selectivity of Ag4-C3N4 towards the HCOOH reaction. For the production of CH3OH, the free energy change of the rate-determining step is 0.72 eV, which is similar to that for the rate-determining step of CH4 production (0.76 eV). The close UL values indicate that Ag4-C3N4 exhibits similar reaction selectivity towards both products. However, due to the lower UL value of CH3OH compared to CH4, Ag4-C3N4 still demonstrates better selectivity towards CH3OH over CH4. The Ag4-C3N4 catalyst for CO2 electrocatalytic reduction favors the generation of HCOOH and demonstrates selectivity towards both CH3OH and CH4. On the surface of Ag8-C3N4, the free energy change for CO generation is 0.69 eV, which constitutes the rate-determining step for CO2 electrocatalytic reduction to CO. In contrast, the free energy change for the rate-determining step of HCOOH generation is 0.88 eV, indicating that the desorption process of HCOOH is more challenging than that of CO. For CH3OH and CH4, both C1 products share the same rate-determining step, with a free energy change of 0.79 eV, indicating similar UL values. The Ag8-C3N4 catalyst for CO2 electrocatalytic reduction exhibits higher selectivity towards CO. On the surface of Ag13-C3N4, the free energy change for the rate-determining step in CO2 electrocatalytic reduction to CO is 0.62 eV, the lowest among the three catalysts. Based on the UL values from Table 3 for Ag4-C3N4, Ag8-C3N4, and Ag13-C3N4 catalysts, as the nanoparticle size increases from Ag4 to Ag8 and Ag13, the activity for CO2 electrocatalytic reduction to CO enhances. This is similar to other Ag electrocatalytic materials, where increasing nanoparticle size results in greater stability of intermediates in the CO2 reduction process on highly curved surfaces, requiring less overpotential to overcome thermodynamic barriers [73]. According to the results in Table 3, as the nanoparticle size of Ag increases, the activity for CO2 electrocatalytic reduction to methanol decreases. Zhao et al. also found similar results in experiments with Cu/ZrO2 catalysts converted CO2 to methanol, indicating that larger copper particles lack the ability to activate CO2 at lower temperatures [74]. The band gap diagrams of the three catalysts are shown in Fig. S5, with band gap values of 0.39 eV, 0.71 eV, and 1.08 eV for Ag4-C3N4, Ag8-C3N4, and Ag13-C3N4, respectively. Among the catalysts studied, Ag4-C3N4 exhibited the smallest band gap, indicative of strong metallic properties, while Ag13-C3N4 showed the largest band gap, implying weaker metallicity. Consequently, the smaller radius of Ag4-C3N4 enabled superior charge transfer during CO2 catalytic reduction, resulting in enhanced catalytic activity. This observation is consistent with previous studies. For instance, Zhang et al. reported that in the CO2 reduction to C1 products using Nin-C3N4 (n = 1-6), Ni cluster introduction reduced the band gap of g-C3N4, with Ni4-C3N4, due to its smaller radius, exhibiting enhanced catalytic performance.[33] Similarly, Liu et al. found that during CO2 reduction to C1 products using REM@N6-G (REM = La, Ce, Pr, Nd), La@N6-G, with the largest metal radius, showed the highest band gap of 1.74 eV, while Ce@N6-G, Pr@N6-G, and Nd@N6-G, with smaller radii, exhibited stronger metallic properties and relatively higher catalytic activity. [63] The band gap values of catalysts are inversely proportional to their catalytic activity, with smaller band gaps indicating stronger catalytic activity. This result indicates that Ag4-C3N4 catalyst exhibits higher catalytic activity. As the nanoparticle size decreases, the catalytic activity gradually increases. In the CO2RR process, if the adsorption energy of intermediates on the catalyst is excessively high, desorption from the catalyst surface is hindered, occupying active sites and potentially resulting in catalyst \"poisoning\" and subsequent activity loss.[75,76] To assess this, we calculated the adsorption energies of H2O on Ag4-C3N4, Ag8-C3N4, and Ag13-C3N4 catalysts, yielding values of -0.37 eV, -0.11 eV, and -0.62 eV, respectively (Table S2). The adsorption energies suggest that the interaction between water molecules and the catalyst surface is relatively weak. Following proton and electron capture by *OH, H2O can readily desorb from the catalyst surface, keeping the active sites available. Furthermore, studies report that water molecule involvement enhances selectivity and catalytic activity during the CO2RR process.[77] Therefore, H2O does not exhibit toxicity on the surface of the silver nanoparticle composite catalysts. In the CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) process, a competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) significantly impacts the Faradaic efficiency of CRR [78,79]. We investigated the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) mechanisms for the three catalysts, with their free energy changes are shown in Fig. S6. By calculating the free energy for the initial proton-electron transfer steps of the CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) *CO2 + H+ + e− → *COOH or *CO2 + H+ + e− → *OCHO and HER's H+ + e- initial protonation steps, we can determine the selectivity of CRR and HER. On the surface of Ag4-C3N4, the free energy barrier for HER is 0.25 eV, while the free energy differences for *CO2 + H+ + e− → *COOH and *CO2 + H+ + e− → *OCHO on Ag4-C3N4 surface are -0.47 and 0.13 eV, respectively. On the surface of Ag8-C3N4, the free energy barrier for HER is 0.32 eV, while the free energy changes for *CO2 + H+ + e− → *COOH and *CO2 + H+ + e− → *OCHO are -0.32 eV and 0.20 eV, respectively. On the surface of Ag13-C3N4, the free energy barrier for HER is 0.41 eV, while the free energy changes for *CO2 + H+ + e− → *COOH and *CO2 + H+ + e− → *OCHO are -0.62 eV and -0.37 eV, respectively. This indicates that in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction process using the three catalysts studied, the HER reaction is inhibited. 4 Conclusion In this study, density functional theory (DFT) was utilized to model Ag4, Ag8, and Ag13 nanoparticles supported on g-C3N4 catalysts. We systematically investigated the structural properties of these catalysts, the adsorption behavior of CO2 on their surfaces, and the catalytic mechanisms underlying the electrochemical reduction of C1 products. The optimized stable structures of Ag4, Ag8, and Ag13 nanoparticles supported on g-C3N4 were employed for electronic density and differential charge density calculations. The adsorption sites for CO2 on the surfaces of the three catalysts were identified and optimized, revealing characteristics of chemisorption. The most stable adsorption energies for CO2 on Ag4-C3N4, Ag8-C3N4, and Ag13-C3N4 were calculated to be -0.19 eV, -0.71 eV, and -0.11 eV, respectively. Notable changes in the ∠OCO angle of CO2 during adsorption suggest significant electronic interactions that activate CO2 on the catalyst surfaces. Concurrently, we explored the reaction mechanisms for the formation of four products in the CO2 reduction reaction (CRR): HCOOH, CO, CH3OH, and CH4. The structures of reactants, products, and intermediates were optimized, and the corresponding adsorption energies, zero-point energies, and free energies were calculated. Based on the free energy profiles along the reaction pathways, we identified feasible CRR mechanisms and compared the product selectivity across the Ag4, Ag8, and Ag13 catalysts supported on g-C3N4. Our results indicate that Ag4-C3N4 exhibits a preference for HCOOH production during electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, while Ag8-C3N4 and Ag13-C3N4 show the highest selectivity for CO. This trend suggests that as the size of Ag nanoparticles increases, the catalysts tend to favor two-electron reduction products like CO, while their selectivity for multi-electron reduction products such as HCOOH, CH3OH, and CH4 decreases. Further comparative analysis of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) indicated that HER is suppressed in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction process for all three catalysts. Band structure and density of states calculations revealed an inverse relationship between band gap values and catalytic activity, with smaller band gaps corresponding to enhanced catalytic activity. Notably, the Ag4-C3N4 catalyst demonstrated superior catalytic activity, particularly for multi-electron reduction products such as HCOOH, compared to Ag8-C3N4 and Ag13-C3N4, aligning with experimental findings. This study elucidates the varying catalytic activities of Ag4-C3N4, Ag8-C3N4, and Ag13-C3N4 in the electrochemical reduction of CO2, showing that catalytic activity increases as the nanoparticle size decreases. These findings provide a robust theoretical foundation for the rational design of novel electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction reactions (CRR). Notes The authors declare no competing financial interest.

        "dc:description": "In this study, density functional theory (DFT) was employed to model Ag4, Ag8, and Ag13 nanoparticle-supported g-C3N4 catalysts. The stability of the Ag4, Ag8, and Ag13 nanoparticle-supported g-C3N4 catalysts was rigorously confirmed, followed by the computation of electron density and differential charge density profiles. The adsorption configuration of CO2 on the catalyst surfaces was optimized, revealing that the adsorption process is predominantly governed by chemisorption. It was determined that the activation of this process is intricately linked to the electronic interactions between CO2 molecules and the catalyst surface. Furthermore, the study explored the mechanisms underlying the electrochemical reduction of CO2, with a focus on elucidating the production pathways of four key products: HCOOH, CO, CH3OH, and CH4, across the three catalysts. The free energy profiles along the reaction pathways were analyzed to compare the selectivity and catalytic activity of the three catalysts for various reduction products. Among the catalysts studied, the Ag4-supported g-C3N4 catalyst exhibited the highest selectivity for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to HCOOH. Additionally, the study demonstrated that an increase in the size of the Ag nanoparticles correlates with an enhanced selectivity for CO as a two-electron reduction product, while the catalytic activity for multi-electron reduction products such as HCOOH, CH3OH, and CH4 decreases. Band structure and density of states calculations for the three Ag nanoparticle-supported catalysts revealed an inverse correlation between band gap values and catalytic activity, with smaller band gaps associated with higher catalytic activity. This work provides critical insights into the relationship between Ag nanoparticle size and CO2 electrocatalytic reduction activity, offering a theoretical foundation for the design of advanced CO2 reduction catalysts.",
