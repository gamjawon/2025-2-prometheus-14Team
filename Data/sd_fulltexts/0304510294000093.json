MO1* Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Amsterdam, Nieuwe Achtergracht 166, 1018 WV Amsterdam (Netherlands) Abstract Self-metathesis of unsaturated fatty acid esters provides a convenient route to unsaturated diesters which can be used as intermediates for the production of polymers and other useful chemical products such as civetone. Cross-metathesis reactions with lower alkenes result in medium-chain fatty acid esters which are highly-demanded raw materials for the industrial production of surfactants. Crossmetathesis with ethene (ethenolysis) gives compounds with terminal double bonds, having a broad range of applications. The metathesis of fats and oils proceeds intra- as well as intermolecularly. Ethenolysis of unsaturated fatty oils or triglycerides allows the transformation of long-chain fatty acid triglycerides into fatty oils of lower molecular weight. In recent years, new catalyst systems have proven useful for the metathesis of unsaturated esters. Especially modified heterogeneous rheniumbased catalysts have attracted much attention. Other catalyst systems have also appeared to be of interest for these substrates, notably molybdenum-based catalysts. Certain CO-photoreduced cyclopropane-treated supported M003 catalysts give interesting results as a possible alternative to the promoted rhenium oxide catalysts, especially when supported on silica. Key words: ethenolysis; esters; fatty acids; metathesis; molybdenum; oils 1. Introduction Unsaturated fatty acid esters and fatty oils are very promising and cheap feedstocks for metathesis. For this reason, the metathesis reaction has attracted attention in the oleochemical industry. In this article, possibilities in this area will be considered; recent results from the author's own research group as well as from the literature will be discussed. *Corresponding author, present address: Werkendelslaan 36, 1851 VC Heiloo, Netherlands. 0304-5102/94/$07.00 1994 Elsevier Science B.V.

Unsaturated fatty acid esters Unsaturated fatty acid esters are generally obtained by transesterification of natural oils and fats of vegetable and animal origin with a lower alcohol, e.g., methanol. Although 90% of all chemical reactions of fatty acid esters (or acids) are carried out at the carboxy function, transformation of unsaturated fatty acid esters by reactions of the carbon-carbon double bond, such as hydrogenation, dimerization or oxidative cleavage is also of industrial importance. Here we will focus on a different reaction of the double bond of unsaturated fatty acid esters, viz. the metathesis reaction. 2.1. Self-metathesis Since the first report some 20 years ago by Boelhouwer and coworkers [ 1 ] on the successful metathesis of long-chain unsaturated fatty acid esters, much interest has been roused for possibilities in the oleochemical industry. In the presence of a suitable catalyst, the metathesis of unsaturated fatty acid esters provides a convenient and highly selective route to unsaturated diesters. Thus, metathesis of methyl oleate (methyl cis-9-octadecenoate), a readily available ester of naturally occurring, cheap oleic acid, yields 9-octadecene and dimethyl 9-octadecenedioate (equilibrium conversion 50%) 2Me (CHZ) 7 CH=CH (CHZ) ., COOMe Me (CHZ) ., CH=CH (CH2) 7 Me + Me00C (CHZ ), CH=CH (CHZ ), COOMe Unsaturated diesters can be used for the production of useful chemical products such as macrocyclic compounds. Thus, the diester of methyl (or ethyl) oleate can be converted via a Dieckmann condensation to civetone, an important base material in the perfume industry [ 2,3] . Dicarboxylic esters and acids are also interesting starting materials for the manufacture of unsaturated polyesters and polyamides. 9-Octadecene can be dimerized to a lube oil range hydrocarbon intermediate. In order to obtain a general impression of the possibilities for fat research, many unsaturated fatty acid methyl esters of the general formula Me (CHZ) CH=CH(CHz).COOMe were subjected to metathesis conditions [4]: 2Me (CHZ ), CH=CH (CHZ) , COOMe Me(CH2) CH=CH(CHZ) Me+Me00C(CH2)~CH=CH(CHZ)mCOOMe Conversions comparable to methyl oleate (n=m=7, cis) were obtained with methyl elaidate (n=m=7, trans), methyl 11-eicosenoate (n=7, m=9), methyl palmitoleate (n=5, m=7), methyl vaccenate (n=5, m=9), methyl erucate (n=7, m=11, the main substance of high-erucic-acid rapeseed oil and crambe oil), methyl petroselenate (n= 10, m=4, the main substance of coriander oil), and methyl 5-eicosenoate (methyl gadoleate) (n =13, m = 3, the main substance of meadowfoam oil). Metathesis of polyunsaturated fatty acid esters, e.g., methyl linoleate and methyl linolenate, leads to a variety of reaction products, including polyenes, monoesters, diesters and cyclopolyenes [ 5 ] . Metathesis of a mixture of unsaturated esters derived from South African sunflower oil (ethyl oleate and linoleate) producing diesters has also been reported [6]. J. C. Mol /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 90 (1994)185-199 187 2.2. Cross-metathesis reactions Cross-metathesis reactions of unsaturated fatty acid esters with alkenes is an elegant way of synthesizing homologues of these esters, and greatly extends the versatility of the metathesis reaction in the field of oleochemistry. From most industrial vegetable oil crops predominantly fatty acids or esters are obtained with a chain length of 16 or 18 carbon atoms. Shortening C,6-C,8 fatty acid esters to the less abundant medium-chain fatty acid esters (C,o C,4) is possible via cross-metathesis with lower olefins. Compounds of medium chain length - especially C,2 - are highly-demanded raw materials for the industrial production of surfactants. Thus, methyl oleate was reacted with 2-butene, with 2-pentene and with a mixture of 2-hexene and 3-hexene, all giving C -C13 esters [7-9], e.g., Me (CHZ)7 CH=CH(CHZ)7 COOMe+MeCH=CHMe Me (CHZ) 7 CH=CHMe + MeCH=CH (CHZ) 7 COOMe With regard to their chain length these esters are quite similar to those of esters of the fatty acids derived from coconut oil and palm kernel oil. In addition, C -C,3 alkenes with the double bond near the end of the chain are of interest for, e.g., the production of C12-C,4 alcohols by hydroformylation. Not only cross-metathesis of these C4 C6 olefins with methyl oleate has been reported. Their cross-metathesis with methyl linoleate and with mixtures of unsaturated C,g methyl esters derived from tallow and from sunflower, rapeseed or soybean oil [9] or palm oil [ 10] also leads to reaction mixtures containing medium-chain unsaturated esters. Another possibility is the cross-metathesis of C,g methyl esters derived from palm oil with 1-hexene [11]. Cross-metathesis of ethyl oleate with 5-decene results in a cis-trans mixture of ethyl 9tetradecenoate (ethyl myristoleate), a pheromone precursor [12]. Cross-metathesis mixtures of C,8 ethyl esters (oleic, linoleic, linolenic) derived from olive, sunflower and linseed oil with excess 5-decene also produces ethyl 9-tetradecenoate [ 13 ] . It is, however, also possible to lengthen the carbon chain of unsaturated esters: crossmetathesis between methyl 10-undecenoate (source: e.g., castor oil) and 2-butene leads to a C1z ester. Long-chain linear di-unsaturated monoesters (and diesters) can be prepared by crossmetathesis of an unsaturated monoester (or diester) with a cyclic olefin [ 14,15 ] . 2.3. Ethenolysis Ethenolysis, cross-metathesis with ethene, of unsaturated fatty acid esters allows the synthesis of shorter-chain co-unsaturated fatty acid esters with a broad range of applications [16]: Me(CHZ)7CH=CH(CHZ)7COOMe+CH2=CH2 Me (CHZ)-, CH=CHZ + CHZ -CH (CH2) 7 COOMe An excess of ethene can easily be applied (e.g., by using elevated pressures) to suppress self-metathesis of methyl oleate and to force the conversion to completion. The ethenolysis 188 J.C. Moll Journal of Molecular Catalysis 90 (1994) 785-199 of methyl oleate will lead to methyl 9-decenoate, together with 1-decene. Methyl 9-decenoate is the hypothetical source of many polymers and copolymers; it can, e.g., be used for the production of nylon-10. It is an interesting chemical building block for the synthesis of relevant chemical products; after hydrolysis and hydrogenation it yields decanoic acid or decanol, which are used in lubricants and plasticizers. In addition, long-chain dicarboxylic acids and diols can be obtained, as well as fragrances such as 9-decen-l-of and civetone, or pheromones, prostaglandins etc. [17,18], which can easily be isolated in pure form. 1Decene, like other a-alkenes, is an important intermediate in organic syntheses, and has a variety of end uses in polymers, surfactants and lubricants. Ethenolysis of methyl erucate gives another co-unsaturated ester, methyl 13-tetradecenoate, which could have analogous applications to methyl 9-decenoate. To investigate the possibilities of the ethenolysis of unsaturated esters taking place in the presence of heterogeneous catalysts (vide infra) we compared two Re-based catalysts (Re207/A1203 and Re2071SiO2 - A1203) promoted with tetrabutyltin [ 19] . The maximum turnover number, TON ( =number of effective cross-metathesis reactions per mol Re207) of a promoted catalyst consisting of 3 wt.% Re207/S'02 - A1203 in half an hour of reaction time was about 150 mol/mol at 297 K and an ethene pressure of 30 bar. The conversion of the alumina- supported Re201 catalyst increased with increasing ethene pressure in the range 1 to 50 bar, while for the silica-alum ina-supported catalyst it possessed an optimum at approx. 30 bar, due to enhanced deactivation at higher ethene pressures. At pressures above 30 bar the self-metathesis of methyl oleate was almost completely suppressed. The conversion increased with temperature in the range 273 K to 343 K [ 19]. For efficient production of the diester of methyl oleate a two-step process can be considered [ 20] . In the first step the unsaturated ester undergoes ethenolysis to 1-decene and 9methyl decenoate. High conversions can be obtained by using a high ethene pressure. In the second step methyl 9-decenoate undergoes self-metathesis to ethene and dimethyl 9octadecenedioate. (1) Me(CHz)7CH=CH(CHz)7COOMe+CHZ=CH2 Me (CHZ)7CH=CHZ +CHZ=CH(CHz)7COOMe (2) 2CH2=CH(CHZ)7COOMe;F~ CHZ=CHZ +Me00C(CHZ)7CH=CH(CHZ)7COOMe The latter equilibrium can be shifted to the right by continually removing the volatile ethene. In this way more than 50% conversion can be obtained in both reaction steps, and there are no big problems in separating the reaction products, while 1-decene has a wider range of applications (vide supra) than 9-octadecene. The same procedure can be followed with methyl erucate, giving the C26 diester and 1-decene. 2.4. Civetone synthesis As mentioned before, civetone (cis-9-cycloheptadecen-l-one) can be made from the diester obtained by metathesis of methyl oleate (or ethyl oleate) via a Dieckmann condensation of the diester to establish ring closure. For the metathesis of methyl oleate, however, J.C.

Oleon metathesis. a very pure methyl oleate (containing no free acids, alcohols, peroxides or water) is required. We demonstrated a new convenient synthesis of civetone [ 21 ] . In this process, methyl oleate is first converted to the doubly-unsaturated ketone oleon (pentatriaconta-9,26-dien18-one) which can be separated in pure form from the reaction mixture as a water- and acid-free substrate. Oleon was converted into civetone via an intramolecular metathesis reaction as outlined in Fig. 1 in the presence of the heterogeneous catalyst system Re20-,/ Si02 - A1203 SnBu4 at room temperature. Products of both inter- and intramolecular metathesis reactions were obtained. To reduce the possibility of intermolecular metathesis between two oleon molecules it was necessary to carry out the reaction under high dilution conditions. The products were 1: 1 mixtures of cis and trans isomers of 9-cycloheptadecene-l-one and 9-octadecene. Similar experiments were carried out with nonadeca-1,18-diene-10-one, CHZ=CH(CHZ)7C(O) (CHz)7CH=CH2 (prepared in the same way as oleon, but using methyl 9-decenoate as starting material). This also yielded civetone under the experimental conditions mentioned above [ 21 ] . 3. Natural fats and oils Metathesis of fatty oils, which contain many triglycerides of unsaturated fatty acids, proceeds intra- as well as intermolecularly, the latter reaction strongly predominating. Thus, olive oil, which consists mainly of glycerol trioleate, yields 9-octadecene and polymeric glycerides (mainly dimers and trimers). Metathesis of oils such as soybean oil and linseed oil, consisting of triglycerides of oleic, linoleic and linolenic acid, results in viscous highmolecular oils with outstanding drying properties [ 22] . Several types of palm oil underwent metathesis in the presence of the homogeneous catalyst system WCIb/Me4Sn, yielding 6pentadecene and 9-octadecene as low-molecular-weight products, due to an intramolecular reaction between oleate and linoleate or oleate chains in the triglyceride. Quenching the reaction with methanol afforded various fatty acid methyl esters (methyl palmitate and methyl oleate), as well as dimethyl 9-octadecenedioate, through transesterification [ 23,24] . 190 J.C.

Molar ratio triolein/Re207lSnBU4 =166/ 1 / 1.1. Cross-metathesis with lower olefins of distinct fatty oils offer an attractive and nondestructive route from natural fats and oils consisting of long-chain fatty-acid triglycerides with isolated C=C bonds into fatty oils of lower molecular weight [ 18 ] . These mediumchain (C,o C,4) fatty oils are normally found in coconut oil or palm kernel oil and are in short supply on the world market. We studied the ethenolysis reaction in more detail with triolein (glycerol trioleate) as a model substrate: CH2-OOC(CH2)7CH=CH(CH2)7Me CH2-OOC(CH2)7CH=CH(CH2)7Me+ 3 CH2-CH2 CH2-OOC(CH2)7CH=CH(CH2)7Me CH2-OOC(CH2)7CH=CH2 C H2-OOC(CH2)7CH=CH2+ 3 CH2=CH(CH2)7Me CH2-OOC(CH2)7CH=CH2 The advantage of using a model substrate like triolein in stead of a vegetable oil is its simple well-defined starting composition. The ethenolysis of triolein was studied with the two catalyst systems Re207/A1203SnBu4 and Re207/S'02 -A1203-SnBu4 [25]. The ethenolysis proceeds via three consecutive metathesis reactions from triolein (03) to tridecenylglycerol (D3): CH2=CH2 CH2=CH2 CH2=CH2 03 ), D02 - D2 ~~ D3 Results obtained with a 3 wt.% Re207/SiO2 - A1203 SnBu4 catalyst at 297 K and an ethene pressure of 30 bar showed that after 2 h of reaction time a 90% conversion of triolein was achieved at a molar ratio triolein/Re207 of 42/ 1. The conversion and product formation all J.C. Mol /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 90 (1994) 185-199 191 increased with increasing pressure (Fig. 2) due to an enhanced reaction rate. Thus, the yield of the completely ethenolysed product increases with increasing conversion. The same patterns were found for the alumina-supported catalyst. Hydrogenation of this mediumchain triglyceride (D3) gives tricaprin. Ethenolysis of triolein over supported Re207 catalysts proceeds much more slowly than ethenolysis of methyl oleate over the same catalyst; the lower reactivity is probably due to mass transport limitations. Ethenolysis of the triglyceride of erucic acid (trierucaine) produces trimyristine along a similar route. Cross-metathesis of vegetable oils (e.g., sunflower, soybean, rapeseed and safflower oil) containing mono-, di- and tri-unsaturated carbon chains with a considerable excess of olefins (3-hexene, 5-decene and 7-tetradecene) was attempted in order to produce triglycerides with more desirable chain lengths of the triglyceride acyl group. In the presence of the three component catalyst system MOC15 /SiOZ EC14 (E=Si, Ge) the reaction proceeded with high conversion at 80 C [ 26] . Certain insect pheromones were obtained by transesterifi cation of these synthetic oils with ethanol, followed by reduction of the ethyl esters of the mono-unsaturated fatty acids to alcohols with subsequent oxidation or acetylation to form aldehydes or acetates [26,27]. 4. Catalyst systems Because of the potential industrial importance of the reaction, much effort has been devoted to the development of catalysts able to bring about the metathesis of fatty acid esters on a level high enough to be of interest for practical applications [ 18 ] . In comparison with metathesis of normal olefins, metathesis of functionalized olefins, such as unsaturated esters, is in many cases hampered by the poisoning effect of the polar group. Nevertheless, catalysts have been developed which can withstand the negative effect of the functional group. 4.1. Homogeneous catalysts In the first instance, homogeneous catalyst systems were developed for the metathesis of unsaturated esters, mainly consisting of the combination of WCI6 or WOC14 with a suitable cocatalyst such as SnMe4 [ 18,28 ] . More recently, some well-defined homogeneous catalysts which contain an alkylidene ligand and do not require a cocatalyst have been reported to bring about the metathesis of alkyl oleates, viz., W (CHCMe,) (CHZCMe33) (0-2,6-C,H3_ Ph2)ZCl(ORZ) (R=Et or i-Pr) [29], W(CHCMe3)(N-2,6-C6H3-i-Pr2)[OCMe (CF3)2]z [30] and W(CHCMe3)[0-2,6-C6H3Ph(2-C6H4)](0-2,6-C6H3Ph2)Cl(OEtZ) [ 31 ] . The last catalyst appears the most active: 50% conversion of ethyl oleate was obtained after 1 h at 25 C with a substrate /catalyst molar ratio of 500/1. Even a homogeneous rhenium catalyst has now also been developed for the metathesis of methyl oleate, viz., Re (CCMe3) (CHCMe3) [OCMe(CF3)2]z, with a reported absolute rate of approximately 17 equiv. h-` at room temperature [32]. 192 J.C. Mol /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 90 (1994) 185-199 4.2. Heterogeneous catalysts Much effort has been put into the development of heterogeneous rather than homogeneous catalysts, because they are more favorable with respect to the separation of the catalyst from the reaction products, catalyst regeneration and application in continuous processes. 4.3. Rhenium catalysts The first heterogeneous catalyst found to be effective for the metathesis of functionalized olefins such as methyl oleate consisted of Re207 supported on alumina. This catalyst was only active in combination with a small amount of tetramethyltin [ 2 ] . The rhenium-based catalyst has attracted much attention because it is active at room temperature, is highly selective, and can be recovered easily. We have since improved the alumina-supported rhenium oxide catalyst in several ways: (1) by incorporating a third metal oxide, such as V205, Mo03 or W03, (2) by using a modified support, e.g., phosphated or borated alumina or silica-alumina, and (3) by using other promoters, e.g., SnR4 or PbR4 [ 18]. With these rhenium catalysts selectivities of nearly 100% are quite normal. Recent research has been done into the influence of different reaction parameters in the metathesis of methyl oleate in the presence of supported Re207 catalysts promoted with tetrabutyltin [ 33 ] . In our study we used a silica-alumina support containing about 25 wt.% A1203, which appeared to be the most active among the commercially available (AKZO) supports studied [ 34 ] . The conversion increased with increasing methyl oleate concentration in its solvent (hexane). Optimum conversions were obtained at reaction temperatures of approximately 40-45 C (313-318 K) with a turnover number of approximately 240 mol/mol Re207 (Fig. 3). At higher temperatures the rate of catalyst deactivation prevails. Conversions as a function of time-on-stream obtained in continuous-flow experiments are given in Fig. 4. All catalysts, except 1 wt.% Re201 /Si02 - A1203, have about the same conversion-vs.-process time pattern. Apparently, higher rhenium loadings do not give extra active sites for metathesis. Silica-alumina-supported Re207 catalysts appeared to have a higher stability than alumina- supported ones, which is due to a higher apparent activation energy for deactivation compared to alumina- supported catalysts. If we calculated a total TON, we would get a highest value of 444 mol/mol Re207 for a 2 wt.% Re207 catalyst. The turnover number decreases with increasing rhenium content of the catalyst, because inactive rhenium centers are formed at higher loadings due to adsorption of rhenium on silanol groups on the support during catalyst preparation. The latter type of rhenium center is not active in metathesis [34] . In contrast, with an alumina support the turnover number increased with increasing rhenium loading up until about 12 wt. % Re207 and then remained constant, in agreement with earlier results of Ellison [ 35 ] . An explanation for the increase in activity with increasing rhenium content for alumina- supported catalysts can be given on the basis of the activity of the surface Re04 groups which have reacted with Lewis acid sites and with different alumina-bonded hydroxyls during the catalyst preparation [36]. The constant activity in the case of methyl oleate metathesis at rhenium oxide contents higher than 12 wt.% might be caused by the fact that above 12 wt.% Re207 the extra active sites are blocked by enhanced adsorption of the ester. A remarkable phenomenon was observed: the so-called dilution effect. Diluting a Re207 / J.C.

Methyl oleate concentration in hexane=1.5 kmol/m3. Si02 ~ A1z03 catalyst with extra support material before calcination resulted in a spectacular increase in its specific activity after promotion with tetraethyltin. Rhenium analyses revealed that during calcination part of the rhenium was transferred from the original catalysts to the admixed support, leading to a \"lower-loaded\" catalyst, but with the same total amount of rhenium. Indeed, separate experiments confirmed that the turnover number of non-diluted silica-alumina-supported catalysts is higher for catalysts with a lower rhenium content. An additional role of the extra support material was to act as a trap for impurities present in the substrate [ 34 ] . Methyltrioxorhenium, CH3Re03, an organometaloxide prepared from Re207 and SnMe4 brought onto a silica-alumina support forms a catalyst that is active without additives for the metathesis of various functionalized olefins including methyl oleate, and is reportedly more efficient than the Re207/S'02 ~ A1203-SnMe4 system at 25 C when the same amount (e.g., 3 wt.%) of rhenium oxide is used. However, data on a possible regeneration were not presented [37]. It seems that promoted, supported rhenium oxide catalysts are most attractive for ester metathesis. So far, it appears that of all combinations with supported rhenium oxide catalysts, the Re207 ~ B203/Si02 ~ A1203-SnBu4 system is most active [ 10] . However, rhenium is a precious metal and the use of a tin compound has several drawbacks: it is toxic and during 194 J.C.

Tin alkyls pose a real problem for environmental and occupational safety, especially the lower tin alkyls [ 38 ] . 4.4. Molybdenum catalysts Recently, molybdenum-based catalysts have also been reported to be able to bring about the metathesis of functionalized olefins such as unsaturated esters. MoCls supported on Si02 is an active catalyst, but still needs a tinalkyl compound (SnMe4) as cocatalyst [ 12,26,27 ] . An interesting tin-free catalyst system for the metathesis of olefins has been developed in recent years by Russian workers, viz., a M003/S'Oz catalyst, which is photoreduced in a CO atmosphere with a Hg lamp, and subsequently treated with cyclopropane [ 39] . It was deduced that during photoreduction in the CO atmosphere Mob' species are selectively reduced to coordinatively unsaturated Mo4+ ions; the subsequent addition of cyclopropane induces metal carbene formation. These metal carbenes form the active sites in the metathesis reaction. The catalytic system obtained also appeared to be active in the metathesis of unsaturated fatty acid esters such as ethyl oleate, even more so than rhenium-containing catalysts. An ethyl oleate conversion of 50% was obtained within 10 min with a substrate/ Mo ratio of 250 (i.e., TON= 125) at 50 C [ 13 ] . We have developed an alternative activation procedure, consisting of CO photoreduction by a laser beam of 308 nm, followed by the cyclopropane treatment [40]. Catalysts con- J. C. Mol /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 90 (1994)185-199 195 sisting of sso03 supported on Si02,A1203 and Si02 - A1203 (24.3 wt% A1203) were prepared by pore-volume impregnation with an aqueous solution of ammonium paramolybdate, followed by drying in air and subsequent calcination in an oxygen stream at 500 C, and finally rinsed in nitrogen. The CO photoreduction took place at room temperature by irradiation with a laser beam, while the catalyst bed was fluidized by a stream of 1 % CO in argon. After photoreduction, the CO adsorbed onto the catalyst was stripped off in a nitrogen stream, and a pulse of cyclopropane was led over the catalyst. The catalyst was transferred to the reaction vessel under an argon atmosphere, after which the reaction was started by introducing the methyl oleate. The silica-supported molybdenum catalysts thus obtained were more active than supported tetrabutyltin-promoted rhenium oxide catalysts [40] . Fig. 5 shows the conversion of methyl oleate for the M003/Si02 catalyst with varying molybdenum loadings [ 41 ] . All of these give higher conversions than the catalyst system 3 wt.% Re207lSiO2.Al2O3-SnBU4 per unit weight of catalyst. A 5 Wt.% M003/Si0z catalyst is most active; catalysts with a higher loading have a lower activity. The turnover numbers (defined as moles methyl oleate reacted per Mo or Re atom in 3 h reaction time) are also higher than those of the rhenium catalyst; they decrease with increasing Mo loading. The fact that the turnover number decreases with increasing molybdenum loading can be explained by considering the molybdenum species present on the surface of the support after calcination of the catalyst: isolated tetrahedrally coordinated Mob+, polymolybdate in which Mob+ is octahedrally coordinated, and crystalline Mo03.

Mol /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 90 (1994) 185-199 unsaturated Mo + ions obtained by photoreduction of the tetrahedral Mob+ ions, react with cyclopropane to generate the active Mo carbenes [42] . The highest fraction of these tetrahedrally coordinated Mo6+ species is found at low molybdenum loadings and decreases sharply with increasing MOO, content. This, then, also results in an optimum weight percentage of Mo03 for these impregnation catalysts at about 5 Wt. /0 Mo03. Above 5 wt.% MOO, the fraction of tetrahedral Mob+ ions is very low, instead the molybdenum oxide phase mainly consists of polymolybdate chains and crystalline Mo03. It cannot, however, be excluded that at higher Mo loadings octahedral Mo6+ ions from the polymolybdate phase are also active site precursors. Fig. 6 shows the conversion of methyl oleate as a function of reaction time for silicaalumina supported M003 catalysts after the same photoreduction procedure and cyclopropane treatment. It can be concluded that the latter catalysts are less active than the silicasupported ones with the same M003 content. Finally, M003/A1203 showed no activity at all. An explanation for these differences might be that the optimal reduction procedure for M003/Si02, which was also applied for the other two catalysts, is not optimal for all catalysts. From a study of the effect of the reaction temperature on the activity of CO-photoreduced and cyclopropane-treated 1 and 5 Wt-% Mo03/Si02 catalysts it appeared that the optimal reaction temperature is about 40 C (313 K) (Fig. 7) [41 ] .

The turnoverfrequencies ( =TON/ unit time) still increase with increasing reaction temperature. 4.5. Catalyst activity and stability The rate of metathesis of unsaturated esters is inherently limited by the ester functionality. The ester group can interfere with metathesis in different stages of the reaction: (1) by interaction with the cocatalyst, if present, (2) by coordination of the ester carbonyl group to the metal center in competition with the olefinic double bonds and ( 3 ) by destruction of the catalyst precursor or the metal carbenes. In addition, the catalyst deactivates due to impurities in the substrate, such as alcohols, free acids, water and peroxides (their removal might be a difficult task!), or by adsorption of diester when using a solid catalyst, which can block active sites or even the pores of the catalyst. Finally, termination reactions in which active intermediates are lost, e.g., a Wittig-type reaction between the carbonyl group and the metal carbene or reductive elimination, may also be responsible for a decrease in catalytic activity. For the CO-photoreduced Mo03 catalysts an intrinsic deactivation mechanism was sup- 198 J.C. Mol /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 90 (1994)185-199 posed to be operative: isomerization of the Mo-cyclobutane complex, formed in the interaction of the Mo=CHZ carbenes with an alkene, into an inactive 7r-complex of the alkene [43,44]. With increasing reaction temperature both the reaction rate and the rate of deactivation increase. This results in an optimum reaction temperature of about 313 K. In summary, for the metathesis of esters, laser-photoreduced cyclopropane-treated Mo03 / Si02 catalysts form an interesting alternative to the tetraalkyltin-promoted supported Re207 catalysts, although for practical applications the rhenium catalysts have the advantage of a simple activation procedure. 5. Concluding remarks Metathesis of unsaturated fatty oils and their derivatives has not yet made it to a commercial level. An economical metathesis of these substrates is still a \"dream waiting to be fulfilled\" [45]. The activity of the catalysts is decreased by the functional olefin and thus catalyst costs are high, because high catalyst concentrations are required. The question of activity not only concerns the turnover number that can be attained, but also the reaction rate or turnover frequency, in other words how long the reaction takes to reach an acceptable conversion. For the well-defined homogeneous catalyst complexes a considerable amount of time and money may be expended in just the catalyst preparation alone, which means that from an industrial point of view, they are very expensive [ 38 ] . Therefore, in view of the present knowledge, we have to focus on regenerable heterogeneous catalysts. After the catalyst has deactivated, the question is not only if it can be regenerated to its original activity, but also how many times one can do this. For the heterogeneous rhenium oxide catalysts we have already established that they can be regenerated many times without any loss of activity (i.e., by calcination and addition of a new amount of promoter). Moreover, the rhenium can be recovered from these catalysts after total deactivation. References [ 1 ] P.B. van Dam, M.C. Mittelmeijer and C. Boelhouwer, J. Chem. Soc., Chem Commun., (1972) 1221;1.

Mol ∗ Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Amsterdam, Nieuwe Achtergracht 166, 1018 WV Amsterdam Netherlands * Corresponding author, present address: Werkendelslaan 36, 1851 VC Heiloo, Netherlands. Self-metathesis of unsaturated fatty acid esters provides a convenient route to unsaturated diesters which can be used as intermediate for the production of polymers and other useful chemical products such as civetone. Cross-metathesis reactions with lower alkenes result in medium-chain fatty acid esters which are highly-demanded raw materials for the industrial production of surfactants. Cross-metathesis with ethene (ethenolysis) gives compounds with terminal double bonds, having a broad range of applications. The metathesis of fats and oils proceeds intra- as well as intermolecularly. Ethenolysis of unsaturated fatty oils or triglycerides allows the transformation of long-chain fatty acid triglycerides into fatty oils of lower molecular weight. In recent years, new catalyst systems have proven useful for the metathesis of unsaturated esters. Especially modified heterogeneous rhenium-based catalysts have attracted much attention. Other catalyst systems have also appeared to be of interest for these substrates, notably molybdenum-based catalysts. Certain CO-photoreduced cyclopropane-treated supported MoO3 catalysts give interesting results as a possible alternative to the promoted rhenium oxide catalysts, especially when supported on silica.

Cross-metathesis with ethene (ethenolysis) gives compounds with terminal double bonds, having a broad range of applications. The metathesis of fats and oils proceeds intra- as well as intermolecularly. Ethenolysis of unsaturated fatty oils or triglycerides allows the transformation of long-chain fatty acid triglycerides into fatty oils of lower molecular weight. In recent years, new catalyst systems have proven useful for the metathesis of unsaturated esters. Especially modified heterogeneous rhenium-based catalysts have attracted much attention. Other catalyst systems have also appeared to be of interest for these substrates, notably molybdenum-based catalysts. Certain CO-photoreduced cyclopropane-treated supported MoO3 catalysts give interesting results as a possible alternative to the promoted rhenium oxide catalysts, especially when supported on silica.",
