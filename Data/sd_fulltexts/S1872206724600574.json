In order to reduce energy consumption in water electrolysis, it is of great importance to design active and stable electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solution, especially based on earth-abundant metal. Here we integrate carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and Ni-Ni(OH)2 heterostructure multifunctional components to design a self-supported 3D CNTs-Ni-Ni(OH)2 catalyst for HER by composite deposition and subsequent in-situ oxidation. In alkaline solution, this designed CNTs-Ni-Ni(OH)2 catalyst exhibits 0 mV onset overpotential, and overpotentials of 65 mV and 109 mV at 10 and 50 mA/cm2 respectively. Electrochemical measurements, characterizations, and simulation results attribute the outstanding performance to the incorporation of CNTs and heterostructure. CNTs induce the formation 3D catalytic surface, enhance electrochemical active surface area, and more importantly weaken the adsorption of H. Moreover, the formation of heterostructure, especially reversible Ni(OH)2, supplies active sites and adjusts the adsorption strength of H atom to an optimal value. CNTs and heterostructure synergistically facilitate water adsorption, promote water dissociation, and accelerate H2 desorption. Significantly, integration of multifunctional components supplies a distinct strategy for development of cost-effective electrocatalyst with outstanding performance. Graphical Abstract The CNTs-Ni-Ni(OH)2 catalyst was fabricated by integrating CNTs with a Ni-Ni(OH)2 heterostructure through electrodeposition and subsequent in-situ oxidation. This integration synergistically promoted the HER through the enhanced electrochemical active surface area and moderate adsorption energy of the H atom Keywords Ni-Ni(OH)2 heterostructure Electrocatalyst Hydrogen evolution reaction Carbon nanotubes Adsorption free energy 1 Introduction As a promising sustainable energy to substitute traditional fossil fuel, hydrogen captures attentions all over the world [ 1 ]. Combining renewable power sources with electrochemical dissociation of water, such as solar power, high-purity hydrogen can be continually produced and store energy with high density. In order to avoid large energy consumption during hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), active cathodic electrocatalysts are essential [ 2–6 ]. In alkaline electrolyte, HER takes place on cathode through two steps. In the first step, an electron coupled with a water molecule on the electrode will yield an absorbed hydrogen atom (Had) and a hydroxyl ion (Volmer step, dissociation of H2O molecule). In the second step, H2 will form via Tafel step (2Had → H2) or Heyrovsky step (H2O + Had + e → H2 + OH–) and escape from the surface of cathode. Generally, the second step controls the whole reaction rate under low current because of insufficient Had. While under high current, high coverage of Had makes dissociation of H2O molecule (Volmer step) become the rate determining step [ 3–7 ]. Ideal cathodic electrocatalyst should possess high catalytic activity for H2O dissociation, as well as appropriate hydrogen adsorption free energy to balance the adsorption/desorption of reactant/product [ 3,4 ]. From these two perspectives, catalysts based on platinum group elements are extraordinarily suitable for catalyzing HER, and in particular Pt-based catalysts could exhibit the most active catalytic performance [ 8–14 ]. In order to replace precious Pt-based catalysts, Ni-based and Co-based catalysts for HER have been synthesized, such as alloys [ 15,16 ], sulphides [ 17–19 ], and phosphides [ 20 ]. So far, Ni-based materials have been extensively used as cost-effective catalysts for HER, especially self-supported Ni materials [ 21–29 ]. In consideration of the high electrochemical active surface area (ECSA), the self-supported Ni-based catalysts are always designed with 3D structure, and therefore exhibit reduced overpotential for HER [ 15,17,18,30–32 ]. However, for Ni-based catalysts, the dissociation of H2O is sluggish. Moreover, the strength of hydrogen adsorption on Ni is identified to be strong, resulting in restricted desorption of H2. It indicates that the two steps of HER are both limited on Ni-based catalysts. Consequently, Ni-based catalysts always fall short of satisfying performance. It should be noted that, although catalytic activity for H2O dissociation as well as hydrogen adsorption free energy are intrinsic properties of material, they also can be significantly influenced by structure, composition and preparation method [ 21–25 ]. For example, the addition of Mo in Ni-based alloy will distinctly reduce the activation energy for H2O dissociation and accelerate Volmer step [ 33 ]. Therefore, in order to obtain outstanding performance, favorable design strategies for Ni-based catalyst are significantly important, especially on molecular-level for reaction pathways, such as hybridization with functional materials to accelerate H2O dissociation as well as H2 desorption. It has been proved that the kinetics of HO–H bond cleavage on metal hydroxides/oxides could be obviously promoted, especially on Ni(OH)2 [ 12,34–43 ]. However, the adsorption of H2O on Ni(OH)2 is considered as the rate determining step. Based on these findings, Pt-Ni(OH)2 heterostructure has been designed, which simultaneously offer the superiorities of Pt as well as Ni(OH)2. For the dissociation process of H2O molecule in alkaline solution, it was proposed that the boundaries of Pt-Ni(OH)2 heterostructure firstly provided convenience for H adsorption on Pt and O adsorption on Ni(OH)2 due to electrostatic affinity. Afterwards, the specially designed Ni(OH)2 sites could intrinsically accelerate the HO–H bond cleavage within adsorbed H2O mole. Thereby, functional Pt-Ni(OH)2 heterostructure performed as active sites for Volmer step, and consequently provided greatly improved catalytic activity towards HER [ 12,34–38,40,43 ]. Taking advantage of the synergistic effect between different components in heterostructure, catalysts with heterostructures have been designed, such as Ni/Ni(OH)2 and MoNi@Ni(OH)2 on Ni foam [ 30,32 ]. Additionally, many research works showed that, in a carbon nanotubes (CNTs) modified Ni material, CNTs could support the active materials, benefit the formation of 3D structure, and rapidly transfer the involved electrons during the catalytic process [ 44,45 ]. Moreover, carbon materials might even influence activation energy of catalytic reaction, and perhaps be beneficial to the catalytic activity [ 46,47 ]. Therefore, the strategy of CNTs supporting active catalyst can not only supply high ECSA, but may also have a positive impact on the kinetics of HER. Here, we synthesized a self-supported HER catalyst composed of CNTs and Ni-Ni(OH)2 heterostructure by in-situ growth of Ni-Ni(OH)2 heterostructure on self-supported CNTs-Ni film. Attributed to CNTs, the prepared CNTs-Ni-Ni(OH)2 film possessed 3D structure, provided sufficient ECSA, and even weakened the adsorption of H. More significantly, the formation of heterostructure with reversible Ni(OH)2, supplied active sites, synergistically led to an optimal adsorption strength of H atom, and consequently accelerated HER. Attributed to the extremely important synergistic effect between heterostructure and CNTs in the prepared CNTs-Ni-Ni(OH)2 film, the corresponding overpotential for HER was dramatically decreased in comparison with pure Ni. The designed active catalyst with multifunctional components provided a distinct strategy for cost-effective electrocatalysts applied in sustainable energy field. 2 Experimental 2.1 Chemicals Nickel sulfamate tetrahydrate (Ni(SO3NH2)2·4H2O, 98%), nickel chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2·6H2O, 99.9%), CTAB (C19H42BrN, 99%), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 99.9%) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30% in H2O) were bought from Aladdin Reagent. Boric acid (H3BO3, 99.5%) and ammonium chloride (NH4Cl, 99.5%) were purchased from Macklin. Pristine multi-walled CNTs (with diameter of 8–15 nm and length of about 50 μm, Aladdin Reagent) were calcined at 500 °C and then immersed in diluted HCl (10%) for 6 h to remove the impurities. Then the pre-treated CNTs were repeatedly washed with water and freeze-dried for 48 h. Ultrapure water with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ was used in all the pre-treatments, synthesis and electrochemical measurements. 2.2 Synthesis of 3D CNTs-Ni film The 3D CNTs-Ni films were prepared by composite electrodeposition. The electrodeposition solution comprised of 300 g/L Ni(SO3NH2)2·4H2O, 15 g/L NiCl2·6H2O, 20 g/L NH4Cl, 30 g/L H3BO3, 0.2 g/L CTAB and 1 g/L CNTs. The pH of solution was adjusted to 4.0. CTAB was added as a surfactant for homogeneous dispersion of pre-treated CNTs. Ultrapure Ni was selected as the anode, and smooth brass plate was chosen as the cathode. After sufficient ultrasonic treatment and mechanical stirring for the electrolyte, the composite electrodeposition procedure was conducted at 40 °C and 2.0 A/dm2, with proper mechanical stirring. Afterwards, the prepared 3D CNTs-Ni films were washed by ultrapure water to thoroughly eliminate residual electrolyte. 2.3 In-situ growth of Ni(OH)2 on 3D CNTs-Ni film The prepared 3D CNTs-Ni film was immersed in 15% H2O2 solution at 40 °C. After 1 h, an appropriate amount of Ni(OH)2 could be in-situ produced on the 3D CNTs-Ni film, generating functional Ni-Ni(OH)2 heterostructure. Subsequently, the 3D CNTs-Ni-Ni(OH)2 composite cathode was thoroughly washed by ultrapure water and alcohol, and then blown by cold air. 2.4 Electrochemical measurements Electrochemical measurements were carried out using a CHI-760e electrochemical workstation (CH Instrument). The catalytic activity of synthesized composite catalyst for HER was measured by linear sweep voltammetry and chronopotentiometry in a classical three-electrode electrochemical cell. The effective surface of working electrode was placed upwards to facilitate the escape of H2 bubbles. Before each measurement, the working electrode was electrochemical reduced under a constant cathodic current of 200 mA/cm2 for 30 min to get rid of the unstable oxides/hydroxides on the surface. For comparison, 0.1 mg Pt/C (20%) was uniformly loaded onto a glassy carbon electrode of 4 mm in diameter. Hg/HgO (1.0 mol/L KOH) electrode was chosen as the reference electrode, the potential of which was calibrated against RHE. The calibration of Hg/HgO (1.0 mol/L KOH) electrode referred to the reference [ 48 ]. All potential values used in this paper were converted to RHE. A Pt foil was used as the counter electrode. Linear sweep voltammetry was conducted at a scan rate of 10 mV/s. The current density in chronopotentiometry was fixed at 160 mA/cm2. All polarization curves and potential~time curves were iR l corrected. The solution resistance values (R l) were measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Background current could be observed, and shifted the polarization curves positively and disturbed analysis of catalytic activity, as shown in Figs. S1 and S2. Therefore, the polarization curves obtained by linear sweep voltammetry were background corrected in this paper referring to the reference [ 49 ]. In order to estimate the ECSAs, double-layer capacitances (C dl) were determined by cyclic voltammetric curves (CVs). CVs were investigated in the non-Faradaic potential region (0.150–0.200 V vs. RHE) at different scan rates (10–50 mV/s). Δj represented the double-layer charging current density, which was half of the difference between j a and j c. Δj was plotted against the scan rate, and the derived slope was C dl [ 30 ]. 2.5 Material characterizations Morphologies and elements mappings of the 3D films were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Zeiss Merlin Compact) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX, Oxford X-50max). X-ray diffraction (XRD) [ 50 ] pattern was obtained with a Bruker AXS D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (Bruker AXS, Germany). XPS (Kratos Axis Ultra) was used to characterize composition of the films. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis and performance of CNTs-Ni-Ni(OH)2 film The designed CNTs-Ni-Ni(OH)2 film could be simply prepared by composite electrodeposition and subsequent in-situ oxidation in H2O2. The whole synthesis process was schematically represented in Fig. 1(a) , including formation as well as dispersion of positively charged CNTs, codeposition of CNTs with Ni, growth of Ni particles with increasing 2D edges, and in-situ generation of Ni-Ni(OH)2 heterostructure. For the dispersion of CNTs, if CNTs were oxidized to form hydrophilic groups on the surface, such as carboxyl, CNTs should be negatively charged and homogeneously dispersed in electrolyte [ 45 ]. However, negative charge went against the electromigration of CNTs to cathode, which affected the deposition of CNTs in the composite film. As a result, although the prepared CNTs-Ni film showed 3D morphology (Fig. S3), Ni particles did not possess wrinkled structure and 2D edges, which determined a relatively ordinary specific surface area. Correspondingly, oxidized CNTs were identified to afford a small enhancement in performance for the CNTs-Ni film (Fig. S4). Therefore, CNTs were used without oxidation pre-treatment, and CTAB was chosen as a surfactant for CNTs to enhance the hydrophilicity. Attributed to the addition of CTAB, hydrophobic CNTs were grafted with hydrophilic cetyltrimethylammonium group, and could be well dispersed through ultrasonic treatment and mechanical stirring as shown in Fig. 1(b). Moreover, the positively charged cetyltrimethylammonium group on CNTs promoted the electromigration of CNTs towards cathode. As a result, positively charged CNTs were driven by the electric field and co-deposited with Ni on cathode, generating a CNTs-Ni film. In order to confirm the codeposition of CNTs with Ni, the prepared film was etched in 17 wt% HNO3. According to the appearance (Fig. S5) and morphology (Fig. S6) of the prepared film, the morphology of the film after short-time etching (Fig. S7), as well as SEM images of the exfoliated powders after etching (Fig. S8), it could be concluded that CNTs were co-deposited with Ni. SEM images in Fig. 1(c) revealed the surface morphologies of prepared films at different stages. CNTs and spherical Ni particles formed abundant wrinkled boundary structures, supplying sufficient catalytic area. As the Ni particles grew up, significant changes in shape occurred and amounts of 2D edges appeared. The generated 2D edges might play an important role in the catalytic process as demonstrated in many research works [ 38,40,51 ]. After an oxidation treatment in H2O2, Ni-Ni(OH)2 heterostructure was confirmed to be in-situ generated by elements mappings, XPS and XRD, as shown in Fig. 2 . The corresponding elements mappings (Fig. 2(a)) resolved distribution of Ni, O, and C elements on the synthesized film. Furthermore, composition of the film was investigated by XPS in Fig. 2(b). The generation of Ni(OH)2 was confirmed by peak at 531.8 eV in high-resolution O 1s XPS spectra. High-resolution Ni 2p 3/2 XPS spectra identified the domination of Ni(OH)2 (856.2 eV) on the surface. However, after Ar+ sputtering for 60 s, the peak for metallic Ni (852.2 eV) enhanced remarkably, implying the coexistence of Ni with Ni(OH)2 on the subsurface [ 50,52–56 ]. In addition, XRD pattern (Fig. 2(c)) could reveal the co-existence of Ni and Ni(OH)2 in the film [ 51 ]. According to the results, it was determined that the interfacial Ni-Ni(OH)2 heterostructure could be formed on the self-supported film. The outstanding catalytic property of designed CNTs-Ni-Ni(OH)2 film for HER in alkaline solution was demonstrated by linear sweep voltammetry as well as chronopotentiometry. The polarization curve for CNTs-Ni-Ni(OH)2 film in Fig. 3(a) was background corrected, because substantial background current could be observed (Fig. S1). The background current might be ascribed to non-faradaic procedures and other electrochemical process. The accurate correction processes referred to the reference [ 49 ]. In fact, the correction for background current negatively shifted the curves. After correction, CNTs-Ni-Ni(OH)2 film exhibited 0 mV onset overpotential for HER, and overpotentials of 65 and 109 mV at 10 and 50 mA/cm2 respectively, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The HER performance of prepared CNTs-Ni-Ni(OH)2 film was compared with the reported catalysts supported on 3D substrates and catalysts with heterostructures as exhibited in Table S1. Generally, the reported catalysts were not background corrected and were supported on Ni foam. However, the performance of designed CNTs-Ni-Ni(OH)2 film supported on a smooth substrate was identified rather excellent [ 21,30,32,51,56–63 ]. Furthermore, chronopotentiometry identified the overpotential to be around 160 mV under the current of 160 mA/cm2 (Fig. 3(b)). More importantly, the designed CNTs-Ni-Ni(OH)2 film showed stable catalytic activity, and had even lower overpotential than Pt/C under long-term electrolysis. The outstanding performance could be attributed to incorporation of CNTs, formation of heterostructure, as well as their corresponding synergistic effect. 3.2 Significance of CNTs in the film After background corrections (Fig. S2), the catalytic activities of 3D CNTs-Ni films were still obviously much higher than that of pure Ni. The overpotential could be reduced for more than 100 mV as revealed by polarization curves in Fig. 4(a) . It indicated that the incorporation of CNTs actually played a positive role. Unlike the particular structure in Fig. 4, surface morphology of pure Ni film was revealed to be relatively smooth (Fig. S9). Therefore, the addition of CNTs in electrolyte facilitated the formation of 3D structure. SEM images in Figs. 4(b)–(g) revealed more specific processes for growth of CNTs-Ni film. At the initial stage, porous CNTs-Ni film with spherical and wrinkled particles formed, as shown in Figs. 4(b) and (c). Besides increased specific surface area, it could play a part of bubble refining devices, promoting the escape of H2 bubbles as well as avoiding the isolation of catalytic surface from electrolyte. As the codeposition proceeded, wrinkled Ni spheres grew up (Figs. 4(d) and (e)), and supplied plenty of 2D edges. When the deposition time reached 60 min, Ni cluster changed from wrinkled sphere to flower-like shape (Figs. 4(f) and (g)). Surface structure became more and more complex with deposition time, while the performance did not show an ascending tendency, and reached optimum with the deposition time of 30 min. To further demonstrate the HER performance from the point of view of geometry, C dl values were calculated to estimate ECSA, as shown in Figs. S10 and S11. The C dl value of pure Ni was only 0.683 mF/cm2, while CNTs-Ni films showed much higher C dl values. Importantly, the C dl value dramatically increased with the deposition time. It indicated that the CNTs-Ni film (60 min) not only exhibited the most complex structure as shown in Fig. 4, but also indeed provided the most electrochemical active sites. In order to compare the HER performances more fairly, the polarization curves in Fig. 4(a) were normalized to the corresponding ECSAs (C dl values) as illustrated in Fig. S12. Impressively, the CNTs-Ni film (15 min) showed the most excellent HER performance after normalization, while the normalized HER performance of CNTs-Ni film (60 min) was similar to pure Ni [ 30 ]. It suggested that CNTs had a positive influence on the kinetics of HER on Ni, however excessive Ni on CNTs would weaken or even eliminate the influence. It also implied that appropriate incorporation of CNTs might be beneficial for HER by enhanced ECSA as well as improved kinetics. 3.3 Importance of Ni-Ni(OH)2 heterostructure for activated HER The significance of constructing Ni-Ni(OH)2 heterostructure on CNTs-Ni film to catalyze HER was determined in Fig. 5(a) . Compared with CNTs-Ni film, the polarization curves obviously shifted to the positive direction after the formation of Ni-Ni(OH)2 heterostructure. It identified the significantly improved performances for CNTs-Ni-Ni(OH)2 films. For the films with oxidation times of 0.5 and 1 h, the overpotentials were approximately 100 mV lower than that for CNTs-Ni. The outstanding performance could be attributed to the formation Ni-Ni(OH)2 heterostructure. However, excessive oxidation (oxidation for 2 h) led to the depression of HER activity. In order to analyze the relationship between Ni-Ni(OH)2 heterostructure and HER performance, C dl values of the CNTs-Ni-Ni(OH)2 films were calculated and compared in Figs. S13 and S14. The C dl value increased obviously after oxidation for 1 h, and reached 8.86 mF/cm2 after oxidation for 2 h. Therefore, the generation of Ni-Ni(OH)2 heterostructure could supply sufficient active surface area and facilitate HER from the point of view of geometry. Impressively, after normalization to ECSAs (C dl values), the polarization curves in Fig. 5(b) obviously demonstrated that the oxidation time depressed kinetics, and CNTs-Ni-Ni(OH)2 film with oxidation time of 0.5 h showed the most excellent performance [ 30 ]. Therefore, excessive oxidation remarkably worsen the kinetics of HER, in spite of enhanced ECSA. Acceleration of H2O dissociation on Ni(OH)2 has been verified by many research works. However, the adsorption of H2O on Ni(OH)2 was considered to be difficult [ 12,38–43 ]. Therefore, the domination of Ni(OH)2 on the surface proved by XPS analysis in Fig. 2(b) should not facilitate HER. Indeed, the background currents for the CNTs-Ni-Ni(OH)2 films in Fig. S15 demonstrated a distinct phenomenon. In spite of the increasing ECSA with oxidation time, the background currents were inconsistent with ECSAs, but were in accord with the corresponding HER performances. Therefore, we proposed that the background current might contain the electrochemical reduction of reversible Ni(OH)2 as well as non-faradaic procedures, and the regenerated Ni on Ni(OH)2 acted as the active sites. Briefly, the formation of reversible Ni(OH)2 during oxidation process was absolutely necessary for HER, and excessive oxidation damaged the reversibility of Ni(OH)2. The optimal HER performance of generated Ni-Ni(OH)2 heterostructure originated from improved ECSA and appropriate HER kinetics. Moreover, the negative influence of improper oxidation on the HER performance could be further evidenced by the fact that improper oxidation temperature (Fig. S16) and other oxidation methods (Fig. S17) for CNTs-Ni film could not obtain satisfying catalytic activity. 3.4 Computational synergistic effect between CNT and heterostructure In order to further evaluate the influence of CNTs on HER and their synergistic effect, computational simulations were employed. The calculation details were shown in the supporting information. Based on the distinct theory that the reversible Ni(OH)2 provided enhanced ECSA as well as re-generated Ni on reversible Ni(OH)2 supplied active sites, CNT-Ni(OH)2-Ni was used to simulate the synergistic effect between CNTs and heterostructure. Adsorption free energies of H as well as the density of states (DOS) of pure Ni, CNT-Ni and CNT-Ni(OH)2-Ni were calculated and compared in Fig. 6 . As shown in Fig. 6(b), the adsorption free energy of H atom (ΔG H) on pure Ni was –0.42 eV, corresponding to a theoretical overpotential (η HER) of 0.42 V. While the ΔG H (η HER) on CNT-Ni turned to be 0.10 eV (0.10 V), indicating weakened adsorption. This should be ascribed to the fact that the incorporation of CNT significantly reduced the d band center of Ni (ɛ d) from –1.156 to –1.243 eV as indicated in Fig. 6(c). Furthermore, the importance of Ni on Ni(OH)2 was illustrated by computational results in Figs. 6(b) and (c)). The computed ΔG H (η HER) on CNT-Ni(OH)2-Ni was 0.02 eV (0.02 V), which was quite close to 0 and in line with experimental observation very well. Computation found that the ɛ d value slightly increased to –1.179 eV induced by the incorporation of Ni(OH)2. The moderate ɛ d in CNT-Ni(OH)2-Ni led to an optimal adsorption strength of H atom, thus excellent HER activity. Therefore, CNT and heterostructure in the as-prepared catalyst could synergistically improve kinetics, as illustrated in Fig. 7 . Firstly, the electrochemical reduction of reversible Ni(OH)2 to Ni active sites promoted water adsorption. Secondly, Ni active sites and residual Ni(OH)2 on the surface supplied convenience for dissociation of adsorbed H2O [ 12,38,40,43 ]. Then the desorption of Had could be accelerated because of the moderate adsorption of H induced by CNT and heterostructure. 4 Conclusions This work successfully synthesized a 3D CNTs-Ni-Ni(OH)2 catalyst for active HER by codeposition and following in-situ oxidation. CNTs and Ni-Ni(OH)2 heterostructure in the designed CNTs-Ni-Ni(OH)2 film greatly enhanced the ECSA, and could improve the HER activity from geometric factors. Importantly, the incorporation of CNT as well as heterostructure adjusted the ɛ d value to a moderate value (–1.179 eV) for hydrogen adsorption. As a result, CNTs and heterostructure synergistically improved kinetics for HER, as well as geometry of the CNTs-Ni-Ni(OH)2 film. Therefore, the designed 3D CNTs-Ni-Ni(OH)2 catalyst in this paper showed extraordinary performance for HER, suggested promising application for HER in alkaline solution. In addition, this research work provided a distinct strategy to design and simply synthesize cost-effective Ni-based electrocatalyst with excellent catalytic performance for HER.

        "dc:description": "In order to reduce energy consumption in water electrolysis, it is of great importance to design active and stable electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solution, especially based on earth-abundant metal. Here we integrate carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and Ni-Ni(OH)2 heterostructure multifunctional components to design a self-supported 3D CNTs-Ni-Ni(OH)2 catalyst for HER by composite deposition and subsequent in-situ oxidation. In alkaline solution, this designed CNTs-Ni-Ni(OH)2 catalyst exhibits 0 mV onset overpotential, and overpotentials of 65 mV and 109 mV at 10 and 50 mA/cm2 respectively. Electrochemical measurements, characterizations, and simulation results attribute the outstanding performance to the incorporation of CNTs and heterostructure. CNTs induce the formation 3D catalytic surface, enhance electrochemical active surface area, and more importantly weaken the adsorption of H. Moreover, the formation of heterostructure, especially reversible Ni(OH)2, supplies active sites and adjusts the adsorption strength of H atom to an optimal value. CNTs and heterostructure synergistically facilitate water adsorption, promote water dissociation, and accelerate H2 desorption. Significantly, integration of multifunctional components supplies a distinct strategy for development of cost-effective electrocatalyst with outstanding performance.",
