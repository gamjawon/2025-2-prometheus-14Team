The catalysts were prepared by the precipitation – calcination method from layered double hydroxides (LDH) structures. The oxide forms of the catalysts were obtained by calcination of these structures at programmed temperatures, up to 350°C. The catalysts were characterized by the following methods: X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), thermogravimetric analyses (TGA), N2-physisorption and temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD). It was found that Zn plays acts as a structure modifier, influencing Cu dispersion and particle size. Consequently, Zn has an impact on the catalyst activity. In particular, the Zn effect had its maximum at the concentration corresponding to a ratio of Zn/(Cu+Al) = 0.35 where conversion of 65% and the selectivity to 1,2-propanediol of 70% was achieved after 60 min of reaction time.

In recent decades, glycerol has been produced in large quantities as a byproduct in fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) production [1]. Its utilization as a substitute for propylene in propylene glycol production is a promising way of utilizing renewables in the petrochemical industry [1]. Hydrogenolysis of glycerol is a reaction of glycerol with hydrogen usually performed in the liquid phase in the presence of a heterogeneous catalyst, although gas phase reactions have also been studied [2,3]. Many noble and other transition metals have been described as being effective as catalysts in the selective hydrogenolysis of glycerol, where Cu based catalysts represent a cheaper alternative to noble metals with comparable effectiveness [2–4]. Cu containing catalysts are usually prepared by coprecipitation [5–10], although impregnated catalysts have also been studied [11,12]. Ƴ-alumina[11] or SiO2 [12] are most frequently used as carriers for the preparation of Cu impregnated catalysts, but the use of MgO for this purpose has also been described [7]. Different methods of coprecipitation have been described as effective in the preparation of Cu based catalysts; the oxalate gel–coprecipitation method [8] and coprecipitation with alkali (NaOH, KOH, Na2CO3, K2CO3) [8,13-18] gare preferential preparation methods. Under certain conditions, layered double hydroxides (LDH) i.e., hydrotalcite-like structures, are formed [13] by coprecipitation of a solution containing divalent and trivalent metal salts. pH solution control is very important for the layered double hydroxide structure to be formed [13,14] during precipitation. As in natural hydrotalcite, also in synthetic LDH, aluminium usually plays the role of trivalent metal, while different divalent metals can be used. Cu is the most important divalent metal used if hydrotalcite structures are prepared as intermediates in the preparation of oxide catalysts intended for hydrogenolysis [14,15]. The properties of the resulting catalysts can be improved by another divalent metal addition. The use of Zn [13,16], Mg, Ni, Co[13] or Fe [14] for this purpose has been described. The LDH containing Al, Cu and possibly another divalent metal(s) is calcined at high temperature, usually between 400 and 650°C [14–17], to obtain mixed oxides which are characterized by small dimensions of primary particles [15]. The particles therefore have a large Cu surface area. After being activated, i.e., reduced by hydrogen at higher temperature and elevated pressure, these oxides provide active catalysts [13–18], usually more active than the catalysts prepared from the oxides obtained by other preparation methods [6–11]. Compared to other oxide mixtures [19–21], the mixed oxides from LDH precursors are more homogeneous, having a higher specific surface area, and individual metals are better mixed there, therefore a higher synergistic effect of metals is ensured. In recent research, special attention has been given to the influence of Zn on the properties of hydrogenolysis catalysts prepared by coprecipitation via hydrotalcites. Cu/Al hydrotalcites with the addition of another metal, i.e., Zn. Co, Ni [13,14], Fe [13], Mg [14] or Ca [18] were studied as precursors for the preparation of catalysts for glycerol hydrogenolysis.Cu/Zn/Al catalysts prepared from hydrotalcites have been found to have both activity and selectivity higher than similar compositions in which another divalent metal mentioned above was used [13,14]. The Cu/Zn/Al catalyst was even active when crude glycerol from FAME production, in which remainders of KOH were neutralized, was used. Although Zn has been described as an effective modifier of Cu based catalysts several times, no detailed study about its role in Cu/Zn/Al catalytic systems prepared from LDH structures has been published thus far. Zhang et al. [16] prepared a series of Cu/Zn/Al catalysts with different atomic ratios ranging from 1:3:1 to 3:1:1 and tested these catalysts in phenol oxidation. The Cu/Zn ratio had an impact on the internal surface area (BET) and the dispersion of Cu species on the catalyst surface, which was very important for the catalyst activity. The maximum Cu surface and activity were also achieved with the catalyst having a Cu/Zn ratio of 1:1. Du et. al. [22], who studied the deactivation of Cu-ZnO catalysts, concluded that the Cu and ZnO crystallite morphology played an important role in the catalyst activity and that the aggregation of these particles caused deterioration of the catalyst activity. A positive effect of Zn on the decrease in the dimensions of Cu primary particles and, at the same time, on the Cu surface increase has also been mentioned in other studies [9,23]. In these studies, an increase in the concentration of acidic sites is also emphasized as being a remarkable effect of zinc addition. However, the role of the surface acidity and its impact on the catalyst activity in glycerol hydrogenolysis have not been fully clarified. Acidic sites are necessary for the first step of the so-called dehydration-hydrogenation mechanism [24] dehydration of glycerol to acetol. On the other hand, they play no role in the dehydrogenation-dehydration-hydrogenation mechanism, which takes place in parallel with the dehydration route [24]. This study was performed with aim of clarifying and analysing in detail how zinc influences the properties and performance of catalysts for glycerol hydrogenolysis obtained by calcination of Cu/Zn/Al layered double hydroxide structures. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The layered double hydroxides, which were intermediates for the mixed oxides, were synthesized by the coprecipitation method. The coprecipitation was carried out in a stirred glass precipitation reactor equipped with two pumps, a thermometer and a pH metre (Syrris Globe). The cation containing solution was prepared by dissolution of Cu, Zn, Al nitrates in deionized water (Cu(NO3)2 ֗ 3H2O; Al(NO3)3 ֗ 9H2O; Zn(NO3)2 ֗ 6H2O; Lach:ner; purity p.a.) . The total concentration of metals in the solution was 1 mol/dm3 and the molar ratio of metals was Cu:Zn:Al = 2:x:1 (x=0; 0.25; 0.5; 1; 1.5; 2). The range of x values was chosen based on a review by Cavani et al. [19]. The aim was to prepare LDH material as a single phase. The coprecipitation was carried out at a constant temperature of 60°C and pH= 9.5. The constant pH value was maintained by controlled addition of mixed solution contain KOH (2 mol/dm3; Lach:ner, purity p.a.) and K2CO3 (0.2 mol/dm3; Lach:ner, purity p.a.). The metal salt solution was fed at a rate of 30 cm3/min. After the addition of the precipitation agent had been finished, the solution was aged for 1 h and then the formed hydrotalcite like compound (LDH) was filtered, washed with deionized water (to pH 7) and dried at 65°C overnight. In this study, LDH was utilized as a catalyst precursor for the preparation of active catalysts for glycerol hydrogenolysis. They were subsequently converted to mixed oxides (MO) by calcination in an air atmosphere. The temperature of 350°C was derived from the TG analysis as the lowest for the complete conversion of LDH to MO (economic point of view). Finally, the metal oxides were reduced by hydrogen (details in Section 2.2. Catalytic testing) to obtain the active form of the catalysts (aMO). All said types of materials were characterized by multiple methods (see below). The names of material samples used in the following text contain the abbreviation of the material type (LDH, MO, aMO) as well as the molar ratio of Zn to Al (Table 1 ). 2.2 Catalysts characterization ICP-OES The real metal content in the prepared mixed oxides was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES - Agilent 725, USA). Before the analysis, 1 g of MO was mineralized with 0.1 g of p-toluenesulfonic acid at 500°C. Then the sample was dissolved in sulfuric acid and diluted with demineralized water. The mass fraction of the metals was converted to a molar fraction being used further for discussion. XRD X-ray diffraction (XRD) of powder samples (LDH, MO and aMO) was performed with the use of a D8 Advance ECO (Bruker) device, applying CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å), scanned in 2θ intervals from 5° to 90° with a rate of 0.04°/s. The patterns were evaluated by means of the Diffrac.Eva software with the Powder Diffraction File database (PDF 3, International Centre for Diffraction Data). TGA Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed in the temperature interval from 25 to 900°C (10°C/min) by means of thermogravimetric analyser (TA Instruments Discovery), in a nitrogen atmosphere. The gas output stream (H2O and CO2) was analysed by a Pfeiffer Vacuum OmniStarTM GSD 320 mass spectrometer. N2-physisorption The specific surface area (BET) and textural characteristics of the solid materials were determined by nitrogen physisorption performed at the boiling point of nitrogen (-196°C). The nitrogen isotherms were measured using an Autosorb IQ (Quantachrome) device. The samples were outgassed at 250°C under vacuum for 24 h. The pore distribution was evaluated by the DFT model, and the specific surface area was determined by the BET method. Temperature programmed reduction Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) of the CuZnAl mixed oxides was determined by a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 (Micromeritics Corp.,USA) device with the thermal conductivity detector. A total of 100 mg of a fine powdered sample was placed in a quartz reactor. Before the reduction, the sample was pretreated in a flow of oxygen at a programmed temperature ramp of 10°C min−1, up to 350°C. Afterwards, the sample was cooled down in a flow of helium to a temperature of 30°C. The reduction was carried out in a flow of a gas mixture containing 5 vol% of H2 in Ar at a temperature ramp of 10°C min−1, up to 500°C. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) with N2O passivation was used to study the copper specific surface area in the activated mixed oxides. Before the reduction, the sample was pretreated in a flow of hydrogen (5 vol% of H2 in Ar) at programmed temperature ramp of 10°C .min−1, up to 350°C, maintaining the maximum temperature for 15 min. The sample was then cooled down in a flow of helium to 90°C. The Cu surface oxidation (passivation) was carried out at flow (25 ml/min) of a gas mixture containing 2 vol% of N2O in He, at 90°C for 1 h. Subsequently, the sample was cooled down in a flow of helium to 30°C and reduced again in a flow of gas mixture containing 5 vol% of H2 in Ar, to 500°C. [25] Temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) Temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) was measured by Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 (Micromeritics Corp.,USA) equipped with a Pfeiffer Vacuum OmniStarTM GSD 320 mass spectrometer. A total of 100 mg of a fine powdered sample was placed in a quartz reactor to perform the measurement. Before the adsorption, the sample was pretreated in a flow of hydrogen (5 vol% of H2 in Ar) at a programmed temperature ramp of 10°C.min−1, up to 350°C. The sample was then maintained at the final temperature for 15 min. After that, the sample was cooled to 70°C in a flow of helium and subsequently saturated with a gas mixture containing 5 vol. % ammonia in helium for 30 min. The sample saturated with ammonia was flushed in helium flow for 1 h to remove physically adsorbed molecules. The TPD experiment was carried out in a flow of helium (25 ml.min−1) at a temperature ramp of 10°C.min−1, up to 400°C. 2.3 Catalyst testing The catalytic activity of CuZnAl activated catalysts was tested in a stainless-steel batch autoclave (Parr, USA), which was equipped with an electrical heating, rotating stirrer, temperature and pressure measurement, gas (H2 or N2) input tubing and a sampling valve for sampling of liquid samples during the reaction. A total of 10 g of CuZnAl mixed oxides (4.8 wt% of the starting glycerol amount) in the fine powder form was inserted into the reactor. The amount of catalyst (catalyst/glycerol ratio) was chosen based on ongoing experiments. First of all, sufficient reaction rate achievement was taken into consideration. The aim was to observe changes in conversion and selectivity over the series of catalysts to describe the effect of Zn content. Before the reaction, the catalyst was activated (reduced) in situ in a flow of hydrogen (30 l/h) at 7 MPa and the temperature was increased by a speed of 2°C/min to 350°C, at which the catalyst was maintained for 4 h. After activation, the reactor was cooled to 90°C, and the pressure was decreased to 0.2 MPa. After that, 200 g of glycerol was pumped into the reactor. The reaction mixture was then heated quickly to 230°C while being mixed at 800 rpm. The hydrogen pressure was then increased to 7 MPa. The moment at which these reaction conditions were achieved was taken as the start of the reaction. Liquid samples were withdrawn at reaction times of 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240 and 300 min. The liquid samples were then analysed by gas chromatography. The conversion of glycerol (Xglycerol ) and the selectivity to 1,2-propanediol (S1,2-propanediol ) were calculated according to (2), (3): (2) X g l y c e r o l = n g l y c e r o l 0 − n g l y c e r o l n g l y c e r o l 0 (3) S 1 , 2 − p r o p a n e d i o l = n 1 , 2 − p r o p a n e d i o l n g l y c e r o l 0 − n g l y c e r o l , where n g l y c e r o l 0 is the amount of mole glycerol added to the reactor and n g l y c e r o l and n 1 , 2 − p r o p a n e d i o l are the amounts of mole glycerol and 1,2-propanediol after defined reaction times. The products of the catalytic test were analysed by gas chromatography (GC) using an Agilent 7890 device with a flame ionization detector (FID). A 30 m long capillary column NukolTM (Supelco), with an inner diameter of 0.32 mm and a film thickness of 0.25 μm, was used. The following analysis conditions were applied: carrier gas He, column input pressure of 30 kPa, gasifier temperature of 320°C, detector temperature of 320°C. The oven temperature was programmed from 60 to 160°C, with a temperature ramp of 5°C/min, then up to 200°C with a ramp of 10°C/min. The final temperature of 200°C was maintained for 30 min. The main compounds were determined, namely glycerol, 1,2-propanediol, 1,2-ethanediol and 1-hydroxypropan-2-one (acetol). Quantification was performed using an internal standard (3-methylbutan-1-ol). 3 Results and discussion A series of CuZnAl hydrotalcite like compounds with different metal molar ratios were prepared by the coprecipitation method. It was found that the real molar ratio values (Table 1) were actually slightly different from what was expected based on the input mass balance. The real ratio values of divalent v.s. trivalent cations (Cu+II+Zn+II)/Al+III were approximately 8-20% higher than theoretically expected. It is however in agreement with the literature as divalent cations have better ability to be built into the structure of LDH, than trivalent cations [26,27]. 3.1 X-ray powder diffraction The XRD patterns of LDH (A), MO (B) and aMO (C) are shown in Fig. 1 . The PDF numbers for the selected phases are listed in Table 2 SM. In Fig. 1A, sharp, symmetric diffraction lines with high intensity at 2 θ = 11.7, 23.5, 34.6, 39.2, 46.7, 60.0 and 63.3 ° can be seen. These lines are characteristic of the LDH structure. Other diffraction lines were not observed. The layered structure with trigonal R-3m symmetry is characterized by lattice parameters a and c calculated from the diffraction lines at 2 θ = 60.0° and 11.7°, respectively (Table 1). The lattice parameter a represents the distance between two cations in the crystal lattice of LDH and the lattice parameter c represents the distance between the three brucite and anion layers. The lattice parameter a increased from 0.3069 to 0.3085 nm, depending inversely on the Al content. This was expected because of the relatively small aluminium ion diameter (0.054 nm) compared with that of Cu (0.073 nm) and Zn (0.074 nm). Identical results were observed by Behresen M. et al. [28]. However, an analogical dependence of the lattice parameter c on the Al content was not observed. The reason is that it is affected by more parameters such as the content and type of anions bonded in the interlayer of LDH. As only the diffraction lines that can be attributed to LDH were found and the lattice parameters agree with the literature, it can be considered as confirmed that pure CuZnAl LDH materials were prepared. CuZnAl MO was formed from LDH by calcination at 350°C and the structure of MO was confirmed by XRD (Fig. 1B). The broad signals with low intensities at 2θ = 35.6, 38.7 and 48.8° corresponding to tenorite (CuO) show the low crystallinity of MO. The intensity of the diffraction lines increased with increasing Zn content. The diffraction line at 2θ = 31.8° observed in the MO_Zn-2 diffraction pattern (the oxide with the highest Zn content) indicates the presence of ZnO. The other intensive diffraction lines of ZnO (34.4; 36.2°) are not observed because they overlap with the lines of tenorite. The diffraction lines of Al2O3 are not observed, which indicates the formation of an amorphous phase of Al2O3 or good dispersion of Al2O3. Similar results have been described earlier [29]. The activation of the mixed oxides (aMO) at 350°C and 7 MPa of H2 led to the formation of another crystal phase identified by XRD (Fig. 1C). The presence of Zn significantly influenced the structure of aMO. The diffraction lines at 43.3, 50.5 and 74.1 ° correspond to metallic Cu formed by the reduction of the CuO phase. Additionally the diffraction lines at 2θ = 29.7, 36.5, 42.2 and 61.1° characterizing the CuO+ species can be seen in the XRD pattern of aMO_Zn-0. They were most likely formed by partial oxidation of the materials during storage with air access after activation and before XRD analysis. Additionally, the diffraction lines at 2θ = 31.5, 35.5, 38.9, 46.1, 48.9, 53.5, 58.2, 61.3, 65.9 and 66.1°, characteristic of the CuO phase, were observed in aMO containing Zn, which can also be attributed to the oxidation of metallic Cu species during storage with air access. Moreover, diffraction lines at 2θ = 31.2, 36.8, 44.8, 49.1, 55.7, 59.3, 65.4, and 77.4, corresponding to gahnite (ZnAl2O4) with a spinel structure were observed. The gahnite diffraction lines were broader and of lower intensity for aMO_Zn-0.25 compared with aMO with higher Zn content. Zn is obviously preferentially bound in the spinel structure of gahnite, which is evident from the diffraction lines mainly those for samples with higher Zn content. Divins et al. [30] presented the formation of ZnAl2O4 spinel at 220°C and a pressure of 2 MPa in the presence of CO2, CO and H2 during methanol synthesis. In catalysts aMO_Zn-1 aMO_Zn-1.5 and aMO_Zn-2 characteristic ZnO diffraction lines were observed. The diffraction lines for ZnO (31.8, 34.4, 36.3, 47.5, 56.6, 62.9, 66.4, 67.9, 69.1, 72.6 and 77.0 °) were sharper, and the intensity increased with increasing Zn content. This indicated the formation of well-ordered ZnO crystals [31]. It can be concluded, that up to stoichiometric amount, practically all Zn is consumed by spinel formation. The excess Zn above this stoichiometric amount is converted to the ZnO phase during calcination. 3.2 Thermogravimetric analysis Remarkable mass loss signals can be detected from TGA curves (Fig. 2 ). The first one, observed at 155°C (for LDH_Zn-0) corresponds to the release of water physically adsorbed in the LDH interlayers. A slight shift of the peak to lower temperature, down to 140°C, with the increase in Zn content can be noticed. The dTGA curve showed a shoulder on the left side of the dTGA peak at 130°C. This is remarkable especially for LDH_Zn-1, being however not observed in case of LDH_Zn-0. It can be explained by the difference in decomposition temperatures of CuAl (150°C) and ZnAl (133°C) LDH structures [32,33]. The first mass loss ranges from 11.0 to 16.2 wt.%. A moderate increase in the mass drop with increasing Zn content can be seen if LDH_Zn-0 was taken out of consideration. The second mass loss, which can be attributed to the dehydroxylation of the LDH interlayer and MO formation, is observed at 183°C for LDH_Zn-0 and between 224 and 255°C for the Zn containing materials (see Fig. 2). In this step, the mass lost ranged between 10.2 and 15.0 wt. %. The last mass loss in the temperature range from 580 to 690°C corresponds to the decomposition of the anions remaining in the MO structure and, at the same time, the MO transformation to the spinel form. In this third step, a higher mass release was observed for the Zn containing LDH, in comparison with LDH_Zn-0. This indicated that zinc was built in the spinel structure with higher stability than copper. The total mass loss was approximately 34 wt. % in the temperature range from 30 to 900°C in case of CuZnAl LDH. 3.3 N2-physisorption N2 adsorption isotherms are shown in Fig. 3 . According to IUPAC characterization, all measured isotherms for MO and aMO are of type IV with a hysteresis loop of type H3. The isotherms and hysteresis loops are characteristic of mesoporous materials with pores corresponding to slit shapes. The calculated values of the specific surface area and the total pore volume are listed in Table 3 . A decrease in both the specific surface area and the total pore volume after addition even a small amount of Zn, was observed (Zn-0 and Zn-0.25) while a further increase in Zn content (from Zn-0.5 to Zn-2) resulted in a moderate increase in these porosity characteristics. A decrease in SBET values during activation in a hydrogen atmosphere was also observed (MO and aMO series). A possible explanation is the blocking of pores by bulk metallic copper species produced within the catalyst reduction. The pore size distribution was determined by NLDFT analysis and distribution curves for MO and aMO are showen in Fig. 3. All MO and aMO CuZnAl samples contained pores in the size range from 3 to 60 nm, with a maximum of approximately 6 nm. It was found that the proportion of micropores increased with the Zn content. The glycerol molecule is, however too large to enter the micropores, and for this reason, the influence of micropores on the reaction is not assumed. During the reduction, a decrease in the total pore volume was observed (Table 3; MO and aMO series). 3.4 Temperature programmed desorption – NH3 Ammonium desorption curves on aMOs in the temperature interval between 70 and 400°C can be seen in Fig. 4 . The curves peaked at approximately 150-180°C. The curves were tailed at high temperature which was evidence of a heterogeneity of acid centres. The inset of Fig. 4 depicts normalized curves 0-1 to compare the distribution of centres. No significant difference in the distribution of centres was observed; only the Zn-1 catalyst showed a higher population of high temperature related centres. The total concentration of acid centres (CAS) was determined by integrating the NH3-TPD curves obtained in the temperature interval from 70 to 400°C. The CAS was detected in the interval of 10-24 µmol g−1. CAS plotted against the Zn/(Cu+Al) ratio (Fig. 4) revealed increasing concentrations of acid centres with the amount of zinc in the oxide. Because the Cu/Al ratio is kept almost constant in the series, ZnO bears a higher acidity than Al2O3 and metallic copper. 3.5 Temperature programmed reduction The H2-TPR analysis results are shown in Fig. 5 . The experiment took place in the temperature range of 30 - 450°C, in which only copper oxides are reduced, which was previously shown in the literature [34]. No reduction peaks were observed on samples of ZnAl oxides without Cu (not shown here). The reduction of copper oxides in CuZnAl MO took place in the temperature interval of 200-405°C, the only exception being CuAl MO, which was reduced in the temperature interval between 160 and 420°C. Three unseparated reduction peaks on the reduction curve for CuAl MO are observed, while only two are observed on the curves for the zinc containing MOs. The peaks reflect either gradual reduction of copper oxides (Cu+II → Cu+I → Cu0) or the presence of different types of copper species (bulk or surface CuO) with different reducibility [27,35,36]. As is apparent, zinc caused a decrease in the end reduction temperature which dropped from 420°C for MO_Zn-0 to 370°C for MO_Zn-2. The shift of the reduction peaks to lower temperatures with increasing zinc content can be explained by changes in the copper dispersion as well as the synergic effect between copper and zinc in the crystal lattice [37,38]. From the measured TPR curve, the total amount of H2 consumed during the reduction process was calculated by curve integration (using TCD calibration). Knowing the amount of electrons needed for reduction and the actual amount of copper in the oxide (ICP-OES analysis), the average change in the copper oxidation state was determined. Specific differences in the copper oxidation state in the CuZnAl series were observed (Table 1 SM). The change in the oxidation state of 2 was calculated for MO with zero Zn content, which means that the copper oxide had been totally reduced by hydrogen. A slightly lower, but higher than 1.8, value of change in oxidation state was observed for the MO containing zinc. This can be explained by the presence of irreducible forms of copper oxides or building a certain proportion of copper oxide in irreducible positions inside the structure. 3.6 H2-TPR N2O passivation The specific copper surface area SCu (m2 Cu/g Cu) and average volume-surface diameter dv.s. (nm), were determined by H2-TPR with N2O passivation. The calculation method was performed on the basis of a previous study [25]. SCu and dv.s. values were determined using experiments on samples with passivated copper, i.e. of copper with an oxidized surface by the reaction with N2O. On the basis of hydrogen consumption during the reduction of the (i) total amount of copper and (ii) passivated copper, the Cu particle characteristics were calculated. The temperature and time of N2O passivation were optimized for the CuZnAl aMO system. The dependency of SCu a dv.s. on the Zn/(Cu+Al) molar ratio are shown in Fig. 6 . It was found that the mixed oxides without zinc have lower values of SCu than the mixed oxides containing zinc. It is apparent that low amounts of Zn had a positive effect on the Cu specific surface area, and the maximum SCu was achieved at Zn/(Cu+Al)=0.2. A further Zn content increase had a rather negative impact. A shift of the temperature maxima on TPR curves with increasing Zn amount, up to Zn/(Cu+Al) molar ratio of 2, was observed because of Zn impact on the mixed oxide particle size. The finer particles, the more remarkable the shift of the reduction maxima to lower temperature, which could be seen as smaller particles are easier to reduce. In the concentration interval mentioned above, Zn takes part in a structure modifier contributing to the creation of a fine dispersion of Cu particles. 3.7 Catalyst testing Before the catalytic tests of copper catalysts, blank tests without catalyst as well as the test with catalyst, containing only Zn, Al and no copper, prepared from Zn, Al hydrotalcite intermediate, were carried out to verify if a noncatalytic reaction can take place. Only negligible glycerol conversion was observed during these tests. Plots of glycerol conversion on reaction time were obtained a result of the batch glycerol hydrogenolysis tests (Fig. SM 1). Glycerol conversion at 50 and 90 min of reaction time were chosen as the criteria for the comparison of catalyst activity. The values of selectivity to 1,2-propanediol at 65% glycerol conversion (iso-conversion data) were also compared for the whole set of catalysts studied. The dependence of the activity and selectivity on the Zn/(Cu+Al) molar ratio is shown in Fig. 7 . The increase in activity with increasing Zn content, up to Zn/(Cu+Al) = 0.35, can be clearly seen in Fig. 7. For this molar ratio, the conversion at 90 min reached 75%, then it started to decline with a further increase in Zn content. A Zn/(Cu+Al) molar ratio of approximately 0.35 (Zn/Cu = 0.5) was the optimum in terms of catalyst activity. The maximum activity was observed over the catalyst with the finest Cu particles and largest Cu surface area. It is therefore evident that Zn affected catalyst activity through its impact on the Cu surface. In Fig. SM 2 is direct correlation of ethanol conversion on specific surface area and copper particle size. In contrast, the selectivity at 65% glycerol conversion continued to decline with the Zn concentration in the same composition extent in which a positive effect of Zn on activity was observed. A selectivity of 75% was achieved with the catalyst of optimum activity, in which Zn/(Cu+Al) was 0.35. The selectivity remained almost constant with a further Zn content increase. Acidic centres on catalyst surfaces can play an important role in glycerol hydrogenolysis. Two possible reaction mechanisms have been described in the literature to date [10,22,24]. The first starts with dehydration of glycerol to acetol on acidic centres, and the second starts with dehydrogenation of glycerol to glyceraldehyde on metallic reduction centres. Both pathways can take place in parallel. As discussed earlier, Zn played an important role in the Cu-Zn-Al catalyst compositions. Basically, the concentration of acidic centres was consistent with the Zn concentration. For the catalyst activity, its dependence on Zn concentration had its maximum response to the Zn/(Cu+Al) molar ratio of 0.35. This shows the complexity of the reaction mechanism and the fact that the pathway starting with dehydration did not prevail. 4 Conclusion Zn proved to be an efficient modifier of the Cu based hydrogenolysis catalysts prepared by calcination of hydrotalcite-like structures. In a certain range of concentrations, Zn can increase the catalyst activity. It was disclosed that its presence in the catalyst compositions influences the Cu particle size as well as their surface. Zn thus plays a role of a structure modifier which is in principle the reason for its effect on the catalyst activity. However, only a small amount of Zn, which corresponds to the ratio of Zn/(Cu+Al) = 0.35 at maximum, had a positive effect on the Cu particle surface and therefore on the catalyst's activity in glycerol hydrogenolysis. The most likely is that Zn in these concentrations, up to the stoichiometric amount, is preferentially bound in the mixed oxide of spinel structure gahnite (ZnAl2O4) during the calcination of layered double hydroxides. This mixed oxide is quite easy to reduce in hydrogen, which contributes to the formation of a fine metal dispersion during the activation of the catalyst in hydrogen. However, a further increase in Zn content had no positive impact on either the Cu surface area or the catalyst activity, although a higher Zn content contributes to a higher concentration of acidic centres on the catalyst surface. An excess of Zn leads to the formation of ZnO crystals during catalyst calcination which causes deterioration of the Cu surface in the final, form of the catalyst. This results in a gradual decrease in the catalyst activity. This also means that the acidic centres are not primarily important for the reaction mechanism in the case of bulk Cu based catalysts.

The catalysts were prepared by the precipitation – calcination method from layered double hydroxides (LDH) structures. The oxide forms of the catalysts were obtained by calcination of these structures at programmed temperatures, up to 350°C. The catalysts were characterized by the following methods: X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), thermogravimetric analyses (TGA), N2-physisorption and temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD). It was found that Zn plays acts as a structure modifier, influencing Cu dispersion and particle size. Consequently, Zn has an impact on the catalyst activity. In particular, the Zn effect had its maximum at the concentration corresponding to a ratio of Zn/(Cu+Al) = 0.35 where conversion of 65% and the selectivity to 1,2-propanediol of 70% was achieved after 60 min of reaction time.",
