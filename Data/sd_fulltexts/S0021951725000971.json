Graphical abstract Cu-SSZ-39 has garnered significant attention because of its outstanding NH3-SCR activity and hydrothermal stability. To facilitate commercial application of Cu-SSZ-39, it is crucial to streamline the synthesis process, adopt eco-friendly synthesis methods, enhance the catalytic performance, and explore the underlying catalytic mechanisms. Herein, ammonia exchange was skipped and Cu-SSZ-39 was directly synthesized via Cu-exchange of Na-SSZ-39. This approach yielded a Cu-SSZ-39 with superior catalytic performance compared to that prepared using the conventional NH4-SSZ-39. Comparative characterization of the Cu-SSZ-39 catalysts, derived from both Na-SSZ-39 and NH4-SSZ-39 exchanges demonstrated that the positioning of Na cations affected Cu distribution, and controlling Na distribution can enhance deNO x activity. It was also found that while cation locations did not alter the reaction mechanism of Cu-SSZ-39 at low temperature, they did increase the concentration of active NO x intermediates, thereby boosting catalytic performance. This study facilitates a more sustainable synthesis of Cu-SSZ-39 and provides deeper insights into how cations’ distribution in zeolites affects catalytic efficiency.

Metal-promoted zeolites have received extensive attention due to their outstanding performance in a wide range of chemical reactions, such as hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, catalytic oxidation, and selective catalytic reduction of NO x with NH3 (NH3-SCR), within both the petrochemical and environmental fields [3]. CHA and AEI, as typical small-pore zeolites, exhibited remarkable NH3-SCR activity and stability after loading Cu species. The Cu-SSZ-39 (AEI) catalysts, featuring a more complex channel structure and higher levels of paired Al, were particularly notable for its commercial potential, providing superior hydrothermal stability compared to Cu-CHA zeolites [4,5]. To accelerate the practical application of Cu-SSZ-39 catalysts, efforts were directed towards reducing synthesis costs and production time, with extensive research on various templates [6,7], precursors [8], and synthesis methods [9–11]. However, as exhaust emission standards become stricter and new, fuel-efficient engines produce cooler exhaust, enhancing catalytic performance of Cu-SSZ-39 catalysts at low temperature remains crucial. Conventional metal doping of Cu-SSZ-39 has been investigated [12,13], meanwhile, to accelerate the oxidation cycle from Cu+ to Cu2+ at low temperatures, hybrid composite catalyst systems have been employed [14,15], including CeMn [16,17], Mn2O3 [18] and CeZrO x [19], each improving the low-temperature activity of Cu-SSZ-39 to varying extents. Additionally, Xu et al. found that modifying Cu-SSZ-39 with ammonia water enhanced NH3-SCR activity by facilitating the migration of Cu2+ between zeolite crystals via NH4 + [20]. Unexpectedly, hydrothermal aging (HTA) converted some Cu2+ ions near d6r into CuO x species, which enhanced the formation of critical nitrate intermediates in SCR reactions and improved low-temperature activity [21]. Similarly, Chen et al. reported that HTA also recovered some deactivated Cu2+ ions in phosphorus-poisoned Cu-SSZ-39 by partially decomposing Cu-P species [22]. Our previous studies indicated that NO2 promoted the SCR activity of Cu-SSZ-39, suggesting a potential for improved low-temperature performance by leveraging the fast SCR pathway, unlike Cu-SSZ-13 [23,24]. Moreover, Fu et al. discovered an unexpected enhancement in the NH3-SCR activity of Cu-SSZ-39 due to H2O, which increased oxygen activation and lowered the overall catalytic cycle energy [25]. Thus, despite their structural similarities, Cu-SSZ-39 and Cu-SSZ-13 exhibited distinct behaviors in the NH3-SCR reaction. Alkali metals significantly influence the NH3-SCR catalytic performance of copper-based small-pore zeolites. Some alkali metals, originating from urea solutions and lubricating oils in diesel vehicles, can deposit on the catalysts’ surface. This deposition can block the pores, reduce the number of acidic sites, and even impair the redox properties, ultimately leading to the chemical deactivation of the catalysts [4,26]. Our previous research had demonstrated that impregnating Cu-SSZ-39 with different alkali (alkaline earth) metals caused varying degrees of catalytic activity reduction, with the following order of impact: K > Mg > Ca > Na [27]. The alkali metals introduced through impregnation typically deactivated Cu-based zeolite catalysts, which was similar to alkali metals poisoning observed in conventional oxide-type NH3-SCR catalysts. Alkali metal Na is commonly found in zeolites due to their synthesis in highly alkaline conditions, and incomplete ammonia exchange can result in Cu-based zeolites with both Na and Cu, and the residual Na can have distinct effects on the catalyst’s performance. Zhao et al. showed that a moderate amount of Na in zeolites stabilized the framework aluminum and enhanced the redox capacity of Cu2+. However, when Na concentration exceeded 2.3 %, it can lead to the conversion of Cu2+ to CuO x , decreasing the hydrothermal stability of the catalyst [28]. Similar findings were reported by Chen et al., who observed that small amounts of residual Na improved the hydrothermal stability of Cu-SSZ-13, while decreased the catalytic activity, due to the competition between Na+ and Cu2+ ions for exchange sites [29,30]. Gao et al. suggested that moderate Li and Na can improve the NH3-SCR activity and hydrothermal stability of Al-rich SSZ-13 zeolite [31]. Our previous research indicated that Na enhanced the NH3-SCR activity of Cu-Beta zeolites, though this effect was strongly dependent on the Cu introduction method [32]. Na also facilitated the migration of Cu species from 6MR into the 8MR of Cu-SSZ-13, boosting catalytic activity [33]. Consequently, precise control of Na was expected to lead to superior NH3-SCR performance in Al-rich Cu-SSZ-39 catalysts. It is crucial to investigate both the locations of residual Na ions and those introduced by post-ion-exchange, and their impacts on the distribution of copper species. In this study, we investigated the distribution of Na in Na-SSZ-39 synthesized directly, NH4-SSZ-39, and Na-SSZ-39 prepared through post-ion-exchange using 23Na MAS NMR. The effects of Na distribution on the catalytic performance of Cu-SSZ-39 catalysts were further explored through H2-TPR, NH3-TPD, and in-situ DRIFTS. The findings revealed that Cu-SSZ-39, directly prepared by Cu-exchanging Na-SSZ-39, showed an increase in [Cu(OH)+]-Z species, Lewis acid sites, and active NO x intermediates, leading to improved catalytic activity. This research enhances our understanding of the atomic-level catalytic mechanisms of Cu-SSZ-39 catalysts. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Catalyst preparation Na-SSZ-39 was prepared by a hydrothermal synthesis method [8], and designated as Na-SSZ-39-D. This material was then ammonium ion-exchanged to produce NH4-SSZ-39, which was further subjected to Na-exchange to prepare Na-SSZ-39-IE. The corresponding CuNa-SSZ-39-D, Cu-SSZ-39 and CuNa-SSZ-39-IE were obtained through Cu-exchange of Na-SSZ-39-D, NH4-SSZ-39, Na-SSZ-39-IE, respectively. The obtained hydrothermally aged catalysts were labeled as CuNa-SSZ-39-D-HA, Cu-SSZ-39-HA and CuNa-SSZ-39-IE-HA, respectively. Details of the ion-exchange and hydrothermal aging were provided in the Supporting Information (SI). 2.2 Catalyst characterization ICP-OES, XRD, SEM, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, 23Na/27Al MAS NMR and in situ DRIFTS were carried out, and comprehensive details about the experimental instruments and methods used were available in SI. 2.3 NH3-SCR activity tests The NH3-SCR activities were evaluated in a fixed-bed quartz tubular flow reactor with an inner diameter of 5 mm. Typically, 0.15 mL catalyst (∼85 mg) of 40–60 mesh was utilized for activity test. The concentrations of NO, NO2, N2O, and NH3 were continuously monitored with a Nicolet IS50 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer. The FTIR quantification was performed using the classical least squares (CLS) method. The reaction conditions were set to: [NH3] = [NO] = 500 ppm, 5 vol. % O2, 5 vol. % H2O, with N2 as the balance gas, and [GHSV] = 200,000 h−1. NO x conversion and N2 selectivity were calculated using the following equations: NO x c o n v e r s i o n % = ( 1 - N O out + NO 2 out N O in + NO 2 in ) × 100 % N 2 s e l e c t i v i t y % = ( 1 - 2 N 2 O out NO x in + NH 3 in - NO x out - NH 3 out ) × 100 % Additional details of NH3-SCR activities and kinetic measurements were shown in SI. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 NH3-SCR performance Fig. 1 a demonstrated the NH3-SCR activity of different Cu-SSZ-39 catalysts. The Cu-SSZ-39, derived from NH4-SSZ-39 through Cu-exchange, demonstrated the lowest NO x conversion, reaching 100 % only above 420 °C. In contrast, CuNa-SSZ-39-D, produced by Cu-exchange of Na-SSZ-39-D, exhibited significantly improved low-temperature activity, achieving 100 % NO x conversion near 270 °C. Following 850 °C-16 h hydrothermal treatment, the low-temperature NH3-SCR activity (<390 °C) of Cu-SSZ-39-HA considerably increased, confirming the previously observed unusual behavior of Cu-SSZ-39 [21]. CuNa-SSZ-39-D-HA, however, retained its low-temperature activity and showed higher NO x conversion compared to Cu-SSZ-39-HA, suggesting that the ammonia exchange step prior to Cu-exchange in the traditional Cu-SSZ-39 preparation may be redundant. To investigate why CuNa-SSZ-39-D, prepared by direct Cu-exchange of the hydrothermally synthesized Na-SSZ-39-D without ammonia exchange, exhibited superior activity, NH4-SSZ-39 was sequentially ion-exchanged with NaNO3 and Cu(NO3)2 to produce CuNa-SSZ-39-IE. Conventionally, residual Na ions and those introduced during ion exchange are considered equivalent, as both are dissolved and equilibrate in the liquid phase, whether during the initial zeolite synthesis or the wet ion exchange process [30]. Compared with Cu-SSZ-39, CuNa-SSZ-39-IE demonstrated significantly improved low-temperature activity, though it was still about 10 % and 20 % lower at 180 °C and 240 °C than that of CuNa-SSZ-39-D, respectively. Additionally, the CuNa-SSZ-39-IE with different Cu loadings also exhibited superior activity compared to corresponding Cu-SSZ-39 obtained under the identical exchange condition (Fig. S1). After hydrothermal aging, the low-temperature NO x conversion of CuNa-SSZ-39-IE-HA showed significant improvement, even slightly exceeding that of CuNa-SSZ-39-D-HA. However, the high-temperature performance of all three catalysts declined, likely due to partial dealumination (Fig. S2). All catalysts demonstrated outstanding N2 selectivity (∼100 %) and minimal N2O production (Fig. S3), with aged samples showing relatively higher N2O yields but still below 10 ppm. Although CuNa-SSZ-39-D and CuNa-SSZ-39-IE had nearly identical Cu and Na contents, they showed slightly different catalytic activities. Both exhibited higher Cu contents and catalytic performance compared to Cu-SSZ-39, indicating the residual Na and ion-exchanged Na within the zeolite framework can improve the catalytic activity of Cu-SSZ-39. Furthermore, CuNa-SSZ-39-IE maintained stable performance after repeated tests (Fig. S4), suggesting that modulating the Na locations in zeolites is a viable approach to enhancing the catalytic performance of Cu-SSZ-39. This promotion effect contrasts with the deactivation observed when Na was impregnated onto the catalyst, as reported in our previous study [27], highlighting the importance of investigating the impact of Na on Cu distribution. As the Cu loadings in Cu-SSZ-39 increased, the proportion of [Cu(OH)+]-Z species also rose [34]. Similar to Cu-SSZ-13, the distribution of Cu species in Cu-SSZ-39 was affected by the Cu loadings. In the present study, to investigate how the Na locations influenced the Cu distribution of Cu-SSZ-39, it was necessary to exclude the effect of Cu content. Therefore, CuLNa-SSZ-39-D/IE and CuL-SSZ-39, produced via Cu-exchanging of Na-SSZ-39-D/IE and NH4-SSZ-39 in 0.001 M Cu(NO3)2 solution for 1 h, had lower and nearly identical copper contents of 0.631 %/0.617 % and 0.618 %, respectively (Table S1). All three catalysts exhibited low catalytic activity, with NO x conversion reaching up to 90 % only above 450 °C (Fig. S1b). Nevertheless, their low-temperature activity followed the order in CuLNa-SSZ-39-D > CuLNa-SSZ-39-IE > CuL-SSZ-39. This further indicated that Na promoted Cu-exchange and improved the NH3-SCR activity of Cu-SSZ-39. Fig. 1b shows the kinetic data of the catalysts. The reaction rate of CuNa-SSZ-39-D was significantly higher than that of Cu-SSZ-39, while the intrinsic activity of CuNa-SSZ-39-IE was similar to that of CuNa-SSZ-39-D. The slightly higher catalytic activity of CuNa-SSZ-39-D at low temperatures compared to CuNa-SSZ-39-IE might be attributed to a marginally greater number of active centers. The Ea values for Cu-SSZ-39, CuNa-SSZ-39-IE, and CuNa-SSZ-39-D were 39.6, 48.2, and 55.8 kJ/mol, respectively. The lowest Ea for Cu-SSZ-39 may be due to the lowest Cu loading and a unique rate-limiting step involving Cu(I) oxidation [35,36]. This variation indicated that both the content and distribution of Na-cations may influence the active centers or the rate-limiting step of the reaction. 3.2 Analysis of composition and structure Na-SSZ-39-D, initially synthesized hydrothermally, had a high Na content of 1.733 % (Table S1). After exchanging Na-SSZ-39-D with NH4NO3 twice, NH4-SSZ-39 was obtained with a Na content of 0.732 %. This material was then exchanged with NaNO3 to produce Na-SSZ-39-IE, which had a Na content of 1.408 %. This suggested that some residual Na ions in SSZ-39 zeolites were positioned in sites that were inaccessible for ammonium exchange [37]. CuNa-SSZ-39-D, Cu-SSZ-39, and CuNa-SSZ-39-IE were prepared by exchanging Na-SSZ-39-D, NH4-SSZ-39, and Na-SSZ-39-IE with Cu(NO3)2 under identical conditions. The Na and Cu contents in CuNa-SSZ-39-IE and CuNa-SSZ-39-D were similar, with Na contents of 0.873 % and 0.897 % and Cu contents of 1.602 % and 1.636 %, respectively, resulting in comparable catalytic performances. The higher Cu content in CuNa-SSZ-39-D/IE compared to Cu-SSZ-39 indicated that Na enhanced Cu ion-exchange, probably due to the lower Na+ cations migration energy, facilitating the replacement by Cu2+ ions [38]. XRD results (Fig. S5) showed that all three catalysts displayed the distinctive AEI structure diffraction peaks with high crystallinity. The intensity of the XRD diffraction peaks for the three catalysts showed almost no difference, which aligned with the 27Al NMR results of the fresh catalysts (Fig. S2). Notably, the absence of distinct diffraction peaks for copper species suggested that copper was probably present as isolated Cu ions at exchange sites or evenly distributed within the catalysts. Moreover, all three catalysts displayed similar rectangular morphologies with particle sizes around 300–500 nm (Fig. S6). These observations suggested that the crystalline structure or morphology were not changed by NH4 +/Na-exchange step. Cu-SSZ-39-D/IE, derived directly from Na-SSZ-39-D/IE, demonstrated markedly improved catalytic activity compared to Cu-SSZ-39. This implied that Na locations affected the state and distribution of Cu species, as discussed in the following section. 3.3 The effects of Na locations on Cu species The positioning of external cations within the zeolite framework is crucial for understanding how various catalytic and adsorption properties relate to structural features. Solid-state NMR is a powerful technique for mapping cations’ distribution in zeolites. Zhang et al. employed 23Na MQ MAS NMR combined with DFT calculations to ascertain the locations of Na+ ions outside the framework of SSZ-13 and SSZ-39 zeolites, as well as the associated Al distribution [39,40]. The one-dimensional 23Na NMR spectra for different SSZ-39 and Cu-SSZ-39 zeolites displayed varying peak shapes, reflecting differences in Na+ distribution (Fig. 2 ). Deconvolution of 23Na NMR spectra revealed signals at −11, −20, −31, and −38 ppm, corresponding to Na+ locations in the 6MR or 8MR sites of the AEI cage. Specifically, the signal at −11 ppm was associated with Na+ at the paired Al position of the 6MR window (SIIa1), −20 ppm with Na+ at the isolated Al position of the 6MR window (SIIa0), −31 ppm with Na+ at the isolated Al position of the 8MR window (SIII’a0), and −38 ppm with Na+ at the paired Al position of the 8MR window (SIII’a1) [40]. For the three SSZ-39 zeolites, Na+ cations predominantly occupied the 6MR sites (Table S2), consistent with earlier studies [31]. Comparison of Na+ distribution showed an increase in Na cations at the isolated Al position of the 6MR (SIIa0) after NH4 +-exchange. Subsequent Na+ exchange resulted in a higher percentage of Na cations at the paired Al position of the 6MR (SIIa1) and some entering the isolated Al position of the 8MR (SIII’a0), indicating that Na+ cations in the paired Al position of the 6MR were highly migratory and easily exchanged. Generally, Cu2+ preferentially occupied the paired Al position in the 6MR [41], effectively exchanging Na+ from these sites [42]. After Cu exchange, the signal intensity of Na+ cations on CuNa-SSZ-39-D and CuNa-SSZ-39-IE were significantly weakened, especially at SIIa1, as Cu replaced Na+ at the paired Al of the 6MR, with some Na+ subsequently moving to the isolated Al sites in the 8MR. ICP results indicated that the overall Na content in Cu-SSZ-39 remained constant before and after Cu exchange (Table S1), but the distribution shifted from the 6MR to the 8MR. Our prior research identified the configuration with Na in the 6MR and Cu in the 8MR as the most stable according to DFT calculations [33]. Increased Na+ occupancy in the paired Al of 8MR (SIII’a1) of Cu-SSZ-39 limited Cu2+ migration into these sites, thereby reducing catalytic activity. The distribution of Cu active sites were determined by analyzing H2-TPR and NH3-DRIFTS, with the results shown in Figs. 3 and 4 , respectively. In Fig. 3, for all three catalysts, the H2 consumption in the low-temperature range (200–500 °C) was significantly greater than that at high temperatures (>500 °C). The peaks below 500 °C for CuNa-SSZ-39-D, Cu-SSZ-39 and CuNa-SSZ-39-IE were deconvoluted into two distinct peaks at 275/332 °C, 300/359 °C and 290/344 °C, respectively. The peaks at 275–300 °C corresponded to [Cu(OH)]+-Z near 8MR while those at 332–359 °C corresponded to Cu2+-2Z near 6MR [8,43,44]. The peak at 617–766 °C was linked to the reduction of Cu+ to Cu0, where Cu+ originated from either the reduction of isolated Cu2+ ions or from the initial Cu+ present in the zeolite framework [45]. The peak at 1009–1027 °C was attributed to the reduction of highly stable Cu+ to Cu0, which occurred when the zeolite structure started to collapse [46]. From the deconvolution of H2-TPR data, the percentage of [Cu(OH)]+-Z to total Cu species was 26.8 %/25.4 % for CuNa-SSZ-39-D/IE, higher than the 18.0 % for Cu-SSZ-39. Furthermore, CuNa-SSZ-39-D/IE also exhibited shift in the peak below 500 °C to lower temperature, indicating enhanced redox performance, consistent with their superior catalytic activity. The proportion of different Cu sites was further estimated by analyzing the T-O-T bands in NH3-DRIFTS spectra (Fig. 4). The negative peaks at 950 and 900 cm−1 corresponded to the T-O-T vibrational peaks of [Cu(OH)]+-Z and Cu2+-2Z, respectively [47]. CuNa-SSZ-39-D had the highest amount of [Cu(OH)]+-Z species at 37.2 % compared to the other two catalysts. CuNa-SSZ-39-IE had approximately 32.6 % [Cu(OH)]+-Z species, higher than Cu-SSZ-39, where Cu species were predominantly near 6MR (88.5 %). This finding aligned with H2-TPR profiles, suggesting CuNa-SSZ-39-D and CuNa-SSZ-39-IE contained more [Cu(OH)]+-Z species, which were more active in the NH3-SCR reaction at low temperatures [48]. This accounted for the higher NO x conversion observed in CuNa-SSZ-39-D/IE at lower temperatures. In addition, the increased proportion of [Cu(OH)]+-Z species in CuNa-SSZ-39-D/IE suggested that Na promoted Cu migration from 6MR to 8MR, consistent with our previous study [33]. The spent catalysts were also analyzed for Na and Cu distribution, revealing that the Na distribution of the spent catalysts remained largely similar to that of the fresh catalysts (Fig. S7 and Table S3). However, the proportion of [Cu(OH)]+-Z in the 8MR notably increased (Fig. S8), which can be attributed to the migration of Cu species in the presence of NH3 and NO [49,50]. 3.4 Surface acid sites Fig. 5 a shows the NH3-TPD profiles (100–650 °C) of three Cu-SSZ-39 catalysts. Specifically, peak A, noticeable between 100 and 250 °C, was attributed to physiosorbed NH3 species or NH3 weakly bound on weak acid sites [51,52]. Peaks B (250–400 °C) was associated with NH3 adsorbed on Lewis acid sites, typically formed by Cu2+ ions [38]. Peak C, spanning 400–600 °C, was linked to NH3 adsorbed at Brønsted acid sites [53]. Comparing Cu-SSZ-39 with CuNa-SSZ-39-D and CuNa-SSZ-39-IE, it was found that Cu-SSZ-39 contained the highest proportion of Brønsted acid sites (55.4 %), possibly due to its lower Na and Cu contents. Conversely, CuNa-SSZ-39-D and CuNa-SSZ-39-IE exhibited more Lewis acid sites, accounting for 56.0 % and 51.1 %, respectively. The NH3-DRIFTS analysis of OH regions (Fig. S9) further supported this, showing that Cu-SSZ-39 had more Si-OH-Al (3606/3581 cm−1), contributing to increased Brønsted acid sites [13]. Moreover, Cu-OH (3655 cm−1) and the hydroxyl groups in partially extra-lattice positions (3675 cm−1) also contributed to Brønsted acid sites [37,54]. Cu-SSZ-39 displayed a higher intensity of Cu-OH (3655 cm−1) compared to the other catalysts, potentially due to its overlap with the bands at 3675 cm−1. In situ DRIFTS using NH3 as a probe molecule was further employed to identify the types of acid sites on Cu-SSZ-39 catalysts, as shown in Fig. 5b. NH4 + species bound to Brønsted acid sites were signified by the bands at 3351 and 3278 cm−1, and the band at 3185 cm−1 related to NH3 coordinated with Lewis acid sites [55]. Additionally, bands at 1473 and 1616 cm−1 corresponded to NH bending vibrations of NH4 + on Brønsted acid sites and coordinated NH3 on Lewis acid sites, respectively [44,52]. Compared with CuNa-SSZ-39-D, Cu-SSZ-39 exhibited increased peak intensity for Brønsted acid sites, likely due to the reduced Na content. Conversely, CuNa-SSZ-39-D showed higher peak intensity of Lewis acid sites than Cu-SSZ-39, indicating a greater presence of Cu2+ species. These results were consistent with NH3-TPD results. 3.5 The reaction mechanism To determine if the reaction mechanism changed with varying Na distribution, in situ DRIFTS spectra of interactions between different reactants over CuNa-SSZ-39-D and Cu-SSZ-39 were analyzed, as shown in Fig. 6 . After saturating CuNa-SSZ-39-D with NH3 (Fig. 6a), bands at 3351/3278/1472 cm−1, related to NH4 + on Brønsted acid sites (B-NH4 +), and bands at 3185/1612 cm−1, linked to NH3 on Lewis acid sites (L-NH3) [44], were observed. Upon introducing NO + O2, these bands decreased, stabilizing after 3 min, indicating involvement of the adsorbed ammonia in the NH3-SCR reaction. Meanwhile, the new peaks at 1575 cm−1 and 1300 cm−1 appeared, corresponding to bidentate nitrate species and ion nitrate species, respectively [13,45,56]. Notably, the peak intensity of the NH3 on Brønsted acid sites (1472 cm−1) initially increased due to NH4NO3 formation, which elevated NH4 + levels [8]. In Fig. 6b, after NO + O2 adsorption on CuNa-SSZ-39-D, a weak broad peak at 1620–1760 cm−1 was observed, particularly at 1716 cm−1 and 1675 cm−1, owing to the formation of adsorbed N2O4 and adsorbed NO2, respectively [56]. Following the introduction of gaseous NH3 to the pre-adsorbed NO + O2 on CuNa-SSZ-39-D for 3 min, these peaks became indistinguishable or overlapped with the broad peak at ∼1750 cm−1, while new peaks associated with NH3 adsorption appeared and intensified. Additionally, the weak bands corresponding to bidentate nitrate (1575 cm−1) species and ion nitrate (1300 cm−1) were observed following NO + O2 adsorption. Upon NH3 introduction, the peak for bidentate nitrate species remained, suggesting the accumulation of stable nitrate species on the surface of CuNa-SSZ-39-D. The peak at 1300 cm−1 intensified, possibly due to overlap of adsorption peak of coordinated NH3 species on Lewis acid sites (1283 cm−1) [57]. These results indicated that NO x reduction on CuNa-SSZ-39-D primarily followed the Eley-Rideal (E-R) mechanism, with a minor contribution from the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) mechanism. When NH3 was introduced to Cu-SSZ-39, its adsorption behavior was similar to that observed with CuNa-SSZ-39-D (Fig. 6c), showing distinct bands for NH3 and NH4 + species. After continued introduction of NO + O2, the NH3 adsorption peaks decreased over time, and nitrate species (1569 cm−1) started to build up on the surface. Passing NO + O2 through Cu-SSZ-39 also resulted in a weak broad peak (1620–1760 cm−1), attributed to adsorbed N2O4 and adsorbed NO2 (Fig. 6d). In the presence of NH3, NO + O2-saturated Cu-SSZ-39 exhibited a gradual increase in NH3 adsorption peaks, with a concomitant buildup of bidentate nitrate species (1575 cm−1) on the surface. These results indicated that NO x reduction over Cu-SSZ-39 also followed the E-R mechanism. Analysis of the spectra after 5 min of NH3 reacting with pre-adsorbed NO x on both catalysts highlighted a greater extent of nitrate accumulation (1300/1575 cm−1) and showed an increased presence of active NO x intermediates (2137 cm−1 for NO2 + species in charge-compensating cationic positions [58], 1926 cm−1 for Cu2+–NO+ species, and 1764 cm−1 for Cu+–NO+ species) on CuNa-SSZ-39-D (Fig. S10) [59], indicating superior deNO x activity. A similar reaction mechanism was noted for CuNa-SSZ-39-IE (Fig. S11). CuNa-SSZ-39-D, prepared directly from Na-SSZ-39-D, showed higher catalytic activity due to better Na distribution at the optimal zeolite sites and increased adsorption of reactive NO x intermediates. In contrast, Cu-SSZ-39, prepared via conventional ammonia exchange, exhibited a similar reaction mechanism but slightly reduced activity because the Na distribution influenced the distribution of Cu species, thereby affecting catalytic performance. As a result, Cu-SSZ-39 was directly synthesized from Na-SSZ-39, leading to improved catalytic activity, a shorter preparation cycle and preventing the formation of ammonia-containing wastewater. 4 Conclusions In this study, Cu-SSZ-39 obtained directly through Cu-exchange of Na-SSZ-39 (CuNa-SSZ-39-D) showed superior catalytic performance compared to the counterpart (Cu-SSZ-39) prepared from NH4-SSZ-39. CuNa-SSZ-39-D achieved over 90 % NO x conversion in the range of 240–600 °C, while Cu-SSZ-39 required temperatures above 360 °C to achieve the same level of conversion. This improvement was attributed to the Na cations enhancing the Cu-exchange process, which allowed Cu species to migrate into 8MR sites, increasing the number of Lewis acid sites and [Cu(OH)]+-Z species. Both CuNa-SSZ-39-D and Cu-SSZ-39 followed a similar reaction pathway for low-temperature NH3-SCR, predominantly the E-R mechanism with a minor L-H mechanism. However, CuNa-SSZ-39-D exhibited more active NO x intermediates, boosting its catalytic performance.

        "dc:description": "Cu-SSZ-39 has garnered significant attention because of its outstanding NH3-SCR activity and hydrothermal stability. To facilitate commercial application of Cu-SSZ-39, it is crucial to streamline the synthesis process, adopt eco-friendly synthesis methods, enhance the catalytic performance, and explore the underlying catalytic mechanisms. Herein, ammonia exchange was skipped and Cu-SSZ-39 was directly synthesized via Cu-exchange of Na-SSZ-39. This approach yielded a Cu-SSZ-39 with superior catalytic performance compared to that prepared using the conventional NH4-SSZ-39. Comparative characterization of the Cu-SSZ-39 catalysts, derived from both Na-SSZ-39 and NH4-SSZ-39 exchanges demonstrated that the positioning of Na cations affected Cu distribution, and controlling Na distribution can enhance deNO x activity. It was also found that while cation locations did not alter the reaction mechanism of Cu-SSZ-39 at low temperature, they did increase the concentration of active NO x intermediates, thereby boosting catalytic performance. This study facilitates a more sustainable synthesis of Cu-SSZ-39 and provides deeper insights into how cations’ distribution in zeolites affects catalytic efficiency.",
