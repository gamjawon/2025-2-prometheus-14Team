ABSTRACT Recent studies have revealed the extraordinary performance of zirconium oxide in propane dehydrogenation, which is attributed to the excellent reactivity of the coordinatively unsaturated zirconium sites (Zrcus) around the oxygen vacancies. The origin of the enhanced catalytic activity of ZrO2 with defective tetrahedral Zr sites was examined by direct comparison with its pristine counterpart in the current study. Electronic-structure analysis revealed that electrons from oxygen removal were localized within vacancies on the defective surface, which directly attacked the C–H bond in propane. The involvement of localized electrons activates the C–H bond via back-donation to the antibonding orbital on the defective surface; conversely, charge is transferred from propane to the pristine surfaces. The barrier for the first C–H bond activation is clearly significantly reduced on the defective surfaces compared to that on the pristine surfaces, which verifies the superior activity of Zrcus. Notably, however, the desorption of both propene and hydrogen molecules from Zrcus is more difficult due to strong binding. The calculated turnover frequency (TOF) for propene formation demonstrates that the pristine surfaces exhibit better catalytic performance at lower temperatures, whereas the defective surfaces have a larger TOF at high temperatures. However, the rate-determining step and reaction order on the defective surface differ from those on the pristine surface, which corroborates that the catalysts follow different mechanisms. A further optimization strategy was proposed to address the remaining bottlenecks in propane dehydrogenation on zirconium oxide. Graphical Abstract The balanced ability between C–H bond activation and H2 formation rendered the excellent catalytic performance of defective ZrO2. Keywords Propane dehydrogenation Zirconium oxide Oxygen vacancy Density functional theory Microkinetic 1 Introduction Propylene is an important raw material that is primarily used in the production of polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, phenol, acrylic acid, and other chemical products [1–4]. Conventional industrial routes for propylene production include steam cracking of naphtha and catalytic cracking of heavy oil fractions [5]. In recent years, with the rapid growth in the demand for propylene and the continuous depletion of non-renewable resources such as coal, oil, and natural gas, traditional methods of obtaining propylene have become unsustainable, particularly considering the low selectivity and high energy input of these methods. In contrast, catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is extremely selective for propylene [6] and has recently gained an increasing market share as an alternative to conventional methods. The two major industrial PDH technologies are Oleflex and Catofin, which utilize platinum and chromium oxide, respectively, as catalysts. Although commercial PDH has made great progress, the scarcity and poisoning (especially via fast coke deposition) of currently used catalyst materials are still bottlenecks, leading to the requirement for frequent regeneration to maintain the catalyst activity. For example, it is estimated that three-quarters of the Catofin process involves catalyst regeneration, which significantly lowers the production efficiency. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify novel PDH catalysts to inject new momentum for further development. Zirconium oxide, which was previously used as a support for PDH catalysts [7–9], has recently demonstrated superior performance as a catalyst in PDH with excellent durability under industrially relevant conditions, making it a promising next-generation catalyst [10–19]. In a series of investigations on ZrO2 catalysts in PDH, Kondratenko et al. [17,19] revealed that the coordinatively unsaturated Zr site (Zrcus) was responsible for the observed PDH activity, which resulted from the formation of oxygen vacancies. In 2015, they compared several oxide supports, including SiO2, Al2O3, and LaZrO2 in PDH and found that the support with the weakest metal-oxygen bond had the best performance [15], which suggests the key role of oxygen vacancies. The identification of Zrcus as the active site was further corroborated by comparison of the Arrhenius plots of the LaZrO2, Ru/LaZrO2, and Rh/LaZrO2 catalyst, where the activation energy was the same; hence, the active site should be the same, which is obviously not a metal and is attributed to Zrcus. It was also noted that Cu/LaZrO2 maintained stable activity for over 240 h in 60 PDH/regeneration cycles under industrially relevant conditions. In a subsequent study, they further elaborated that two Zrcus sites on nanosized ZrO2 homolytically break the C–H bonds in propane [17]. They found that the propene yield and selectivity increased with reduced crystallite size owing to the increased number of oxygen vacancies, which again corroborated the identification of Zrcus as an active site in the reaction. Further insights were gained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the entire reaction pathway. The first C–H bond activation barrier in propane is only 0.16 eV at Zrcus, which is significantly smaller than that on pristine ZrO2 (1.25 eV). On the other hand, the desorption of H2 molecules from the Zrcus site is endothermic (1.4 eV) and the desorption energy is much larger than the C–H bond activation barrier, which suggests that the rate-limiting step should be H2 formation rather than C–H bond activation. In addition, this large endothermic desorption energy severely hindered regeneration of the active site and resulted in a complete catalytic cycle. Nevertheless, the ZrO2 catalyst outperformed most contemporary PDH catalysts, including Pt, Ga x O, CrO x , and VO x in terms of the time-space yields of propene. Interestingly, the activity of the Zrcus site is quite universal despite the phase (monoclinic or tetragonal) of the ZrO2 catalyst [19]. The C–H bond activation barrier is linearly correlated with the binding energy of hydrogen [18], as has also been observed for other PDH catalysts [20,21]. Overall, ZrO2-based PDH catalysts demonstrate superior performance and durability under industrially relevant conditions and are promising candidates for next-generation PDH catalysts. One of the major conclusions regarding ZrO2 catalysts is the identification of Zrcus as an active site in the reaction. However, there are still unresolved questions regarding the reaction mechanism, such as available routes for regenerating the active site to complete the catalytic cycle, and the intrinsic origin of the increased activity of the Zrcus site, etc. However, previous computational studies have not carefully evaluated the effects of side reactions, which eventually lead to coke formation during PDH, and have probably failed to discern the excellent durability of the catalyst. Moreover, the description of the reaction process is not sufficient to reach a decisive conclusion as it is solely derived from potential energy calculations along the pathway. To address the pertinent issues associated with ZrO2 in PDH, a DFT-based microkinetic simulation is performed herein to uncover the reaction mechanism and provide a quantitative comparison between pristine and defective ZrO2. Moreover, DRC analysis and turnover frequency (TOF) calculations from microkinetic simulations are used to establish a relationship between the properties of Zrcus and the catalytic performance. Overall, the current study consolidates the basis of the utility of the ZrO2 catalyst in PDH and paves the way for further optimization. 2 Computational methods The VASP computation employs the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of DFT [22–24]. Interactions between the valence electrons and ionic nuclei were treated using the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method [25,26]. The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerh (PBE) function was used to define the exchange correlation energy [27]. Because the d-orbitals of Zr in ZrO2 are occupied by electrons, the DFT+U approach [28] was used to account for the coulombic interactions, where U was set to 4 eV according to a literature report [17,29,30]. The DFT-D3 method was used for the van der Waals corrections [31]. The energy cutoff was set to 400 eV. The optimization stops when the force on the atom is below 0.02 eV Å–1; the energy threshold was set to 10–5 eV. For the unit cell, a 9 × 9 × 6 Monkhorst-Pack grid was sampled for the Brillouin zone [32]. Tetragonal ZrO2 (t-ZrO2) was adopted in the calculations, which has shown remarkable catalytic performance in PDH [19,33]. The calculated lattice parameters were a = b = 3.64, c = 5.18 Å, which are in good agreement with the experimental value s [34]. The two most stable surfaces, (100) and (001), of t-ZrO2 were selected for investigation, partly because their oxygen configurations are well-defined, which is conducive for exploring the activity of oxygen vacancies [35]. For the t-ZrO2 (100) and (001) surfaces, 6-layer and 9-layer slabs were used, respectively, with the bottom two and three layers fixed during the optimization. Accordingly, 3 × 2 and 3 × 3 supercells were constructed on the t-ZrO2 (100) and (001) surfaces, respectively. To prevent periodic interactions, a 15 Å vacuum layer was used. The k-point sampling for the Brillouin zone used a 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack mesh [32]. Hereafter, the (100) and (001) surfaces of t-ZrO2 are denoted as (100) and (001), respectively. The two different methods for calibrating the formation of oxygen vacancies are shown in Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively: Equation (1) describes the energy cost of removing an oxygen atom from the surface, whereas Eq. (2) is the energy required for the reaction between hydrogen molecules and surface oxygen, which results in the release of water molecules from the surface. (1) E f(Ov) = E d + 1/2E O2 – E s (2) E f(Ov) = E d + E H2O – E s – E H2 E f(Ov) is the oxygen-vacancy formation energy, E d is the energy of defective ZrO2, and E s is the energy of the clean surface slab of ZrO2. The (100) and (001) surfaces with one oxygen vacancy were designated as (100)-vac and (001)-vac, respectively. The adsorption energy of the reactant and product is defined as: (3) ΔEads = E ads+slab – E ads – E slab where ΔE ads is the adsorption energy, E ads+slab is the total energy of the slab with adsorbed propane or propylene, ΔE ads is the energy of gas-phase propane or propylene, and E slab is the energy of the pure slab. The reaction energy is calculated as: (4) ΔE r = E fs – E is where ΔE r is the reaction energy, E fs is the final-state energy, and E is is the initial-state energy. The transition state of the reaction pathway was identified using either the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) or the dimer method and was verified with only one imaginary frequency. The energy barrier was calculated as follows: (5) E a = E ts – E is where E a is the energy barrier or activation energy, E ts is the transition-state energy, and E is is the initial-state energy. Microkinetic simulations were performed using MKMCXX [36,37]. The adsorption/desorption processes are described by Eqs. (6) and (7), respectively. (6) k ads = P i A i 2 π m i k b T In Eq. (6), Pi is the partial pressure of the molecules in the gas phase, Ai is the area of the surface site where the molecules are absorbed, i is the relative molecular mass, and denotes the molecule adsorbed on the catalyst site. (7) k des = k b T 3 h 3 A i ( 2 π m i k b ) σ i θ rot , i exp ( - E des , i k b T ) For the surface reaction ‘s’, the Arrhenius-type equations is employed as shown in Eq. (8). (8) k = k b T h Q # # Q exp ( - Δ E α k b T ) The first term in the program (k b T) is the frequency factor (with units of reciprocal seconds), corresponding to the number of species crossing the barrier in the transition state within a given timeframe. The second term is the quotient of the total distribution function between the transition and the initial states. The last part deals with the difference in the electronic energy of the initial and transition states with zero-point energy vibration correction, which is usually denoted as the activation energy. The crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) was determined using the local orbital basis suite towards electronic structure reconstruction (LOBSTER) package [38]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Properties of pristine and defective surfaces The optimized structures of t-ZrO2 (001) and (100) are shown inFigs. 1(a) and (c) , respectively. As shown in Fig. 1, Zr and O in the top layer of the (001) surface have a zigzag-like arrangement from the side view, whereas they are nearly in the same plane on the (100) surface. The coordination numbers of Zr and O in the top layer of the (001) plane were 6 and 2, respectively, and those of the atoms in the (100) plane were 6 and 3, respectively. The charges associated with O and Zr were determined to be −1.15 e and +2.39 e, +2.41 e in the (001) and (100) planes, respectively, from Bader charge analysis. It has been extensively reported that the Zrcus site is an active center in PDH [17–19,39,40] and is formed after creating an oxygen vacancy, as shown inFigs. 1(b,d). Hence, the properties of the oxygen vacancies are closely related to the catalytic performance of PDH mediated by the Zrcus site. First, the energy for oxygen vacancy formation was determined using two different methods, as indicated in Eqs. (1) and (2) (Fig. S1). Equation 1 represents the conventional method for calibrating the energy cost of creating oxygen vacancies by removing an oxygen atom from the surface. In contrast, hydrogen molecules, the product of PDH, can reduce the catalyst surface by interacting with the surface oxygen to release water molecules and simultaneously create an oxygen vacancy, as indicated in Eq. 2. This clearly indicates that oxygen vacancies are more conducive to hydrogen molecule reduction with a formation energy below 4 eV, whereas the energy for the counterpart (direct removal of an oxygen atom) is above 5 eV, which suggests a possible route for the generation of vacancy sites. Moreover, the oxygen on the (100) surface was suggested to be slightly more active than its counterpart on the (001) surface because the former has a smaller vacancy-formation energy. The creation of oxygen vacancies also induces perturbations in the electronic structure compared to that of the pristine surfaces, as revealed by the PDOS and real-space orbital analysis shown in Fig. 2 . PDOS analysis clearly indicated that a new localized state appeared on the defective surface after the creation of oxygen vacancies. This localized state is immediately below the Fermi level on the (001) surface and at the top of the valence band on the (100) surface. These new states are conducive to electron transfer as the bandgap is narrowed, which potentially increases the reactivity. The real-space orbitals associated with the new state further verified that the new states were mainly localized within the oxygen vacancies; this phenomenon was observed in our previous study of lanthanum oxide, which also demonstrated a localized state inside the oxygen vacancy [41]. The creation of oxygen vacancies also causes charge redistribution, as shown in Fig. 1. The charge remaining after removing the oxygen atom was partly transferred to two neighboring Zr atoms on the (001) surface; consequently, each atom was reduced by 0.52 e. On the other hand, the oxygen atoms around the vacancy were nearly unchanged, partly because of the large separation from the vacancy site, with a distance of 4.21 Å. This situation is different for the (100) surface because both O and Zr obtain charges from the vacancy sites, as shown in Fig. 1(d). Nevertheless, more charge was transferred to Zr (0.36 e for each atom) than to oxygen (within 0.08 e). Overall, charge reduction enabled the Zrcus site to become a good electron acceptor, which could facilitate C–H bond activation by extracting electrons from the bonding orbital. 3.2 Adsorption of reactant and product Adsorption is the first step in the dehydrogenation reaction pathway and is a key factor in determining the activity of the PDH catalyst. Experimentally, temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) is often used to quantify the adsorption of molecules, where strong reactant adsorption often has a positive effect on reactivity [42]. Propane is a nonpolar and chemically inert molecule. In contrast, the target propene product is more chemically active because of the electron-rich C=C bond. The optimized adsorbed structures and calculated adsorption energies of propane and propene are shown in Fig. 3 . The calculated propane adsorption energy was −0.30, −0.58, −0.47, and −0.40 eV on (001), (001)-vac, (100), and (100)-vac, respectively. Propane adsorption was enhanced on (001)-vac compared to that on (001), whereas it was basically unchanged on the (100) surfaces despite the presence of oxygen vacancies. The increased adsorption energy on (001)-vac is explained by the close proximity of propane to Zrcus (2.40 Å), which is the shortest among the adsorbed configurations. Overall, the weak adsorption of propane was ascribed to physisorption. The propene adsorption structures and energies are shown inFigs. 3(b) and S2, respectively. On the (001) and (100) surfaces, the propene adsorption energy was moderately higher than that of propane. On the other hand, the energy for propene adsorption at the Zrcus site in (001)-vac and (100)-vac increased dramatically to −2.75 and −2.62 eV, respectively. This indicates strong chemisorption at the Zrcus site. The carbon atoms in the C=C bond of propene form a covalent bond with Zrcus, which is responsible for the high adsorption energy. The strong adsorption of propene at Zrcus may result in difficult desorption, and also increases the possibility of deep dehydrogenation, which eventually leads to coke formation due to prolonged retention on the surface [43]. Another key characteristic of propane dehydrogenation is the formation and desorption of hydrogen molecules. It is generally accepted that propane dehydrogenation proceeds via two continuous hydrogen-abstraction steps to produce propene [44,45]. Two hydrogen atoms, which are the precursors of the final hydrogen molecule, are generated during this process. As shown in Fig. S3, the calculated barrier for formation of a hydrogen molecule on the (001) and (100) planes is 0.91 and 0.67 eV; these values are comparable to the barrier for C–H bond activation, as shown below. However, this process became highly endothermic at the Zrcus site, with a reaction energy of 1.57 and 2.17 eV, respectively, which means that the barrier for formation of a hydrogen molecule will be even higher. This phenomenon has the same origin as propene adsorption at the Zrcus site, which impedes the release of hydrogen molecules. The difficult release of hydrogen molecules has previously been reported. The formation energy of the hydrogen molecule on defective monoclinic ZrO2(-111) and t-(101) surfaces was estimated to be endothermic, requiring an input of 1.42 and 1.30 eV, respectively [17,19]. From the above discussions, the superior activity of Zrcus is a double-edged sword because it enhances the adsorption of propane, but excessively strong adsorption of propene and hydrogen hinders the formation of the products, which might reduce the yields. 3.3 Reaction pathways of propane dehydrogenation 3.3.1 Pristine surfaces The PDH reaction pathway for propane dehydrogenation involves two processes: continuous hydrogen abstraction and product (propene and hydrogen molecules) desorption. On the pristine (100) and (001) surfaces, the reaction starts with the physical adsorption of propane at a distance of 2.72 and 2.49 Å above the respective catalyst surfaces, as shown in Figs. S4 and S5. Generally, metal-oxygen pairs on metal oxide surfaces serve as active sites for breaking C–H bonds, and two dissociation fragments, C3H7 and H, bind at the metal and oxygen sites, respectively, in the current case. Note that there are two different kinds of hydrogen atoms in a propane molecule, namely, primary and secondary hydrogen. Therefore, two different choices are available for the first C–H bond activation in propane, as shown inFigs. 4 and S6, where the secondary hydrogen has a weaker C–H bond than the primary hydrogen; therefore, secondary hydrogen abstraction was first explored, as shown in Fig. 4. After propane physisorption, the reaction proceeded via the first C–H bond activation with a calculated barrier of 0.99 and 1.42 eV on the (100) and (001) surfaces, respectively (shown as TS1 in Fig. 4(a)). Note that C–H bond breaking was accompanied by the transfer of a charge of 0.12 and 0.01 e from propane to the (100) and (001) surfaces of the catalyst, respectively, indicating that activation proceeded via a σ-bond donation mechanism as charge was transferred from the bonding orbital to destabilize the C–H bond. From charge analysis, C–H bond breaking is suggested to proceed via heterolytic dissociation, as H is positively charged and C is negatively charged. C3H7* and H* fragments that dissociated from the first C–H bond undergo breaking and binding at the O and Zr sites to form surface propyl and hydroxyl groups. In the second hydrogen abstraction step, neighboring Zr or O sites abstract hydrogen from the (100) and (001) surfaces, respectively, concurrently with propene desorption. The calculated barrier for the second C–H bond activation on the (100) and (001) surfaces was 1.17 and 1.26 eV, respectively, where the barrier for the former is still smaller than that for the latter, which follows the same trend as the first C–H bond activation. In this step, the two remaining hydrogens on the surfaces are converted to metal hydride (Zr–H) and hydroxyl (O–H), respectively, which form another product, a hydrogen molecule, to restore the active site thereby completing the catalytic cycle. This process is indicated by configurations E1–A1, as shown in Fig. S5. During this process, there was one extra step for hydrogen diffusion on the (001) surface, with a barrier of 0.87 eV, which was absent on the (100) surface because of the close proximity between the two hydrogen atoms. Overall, the barrier for formation of the hydrogen molecule was 0.67 and 0.91 eV, respectively, on the (100) and (001) surfaces. Overall, the (100) surface has a lower barrier for C–H bond activation and hydrogen-molecule formation than the (001) surface. 3.3.2 Defective surfaces Propane dehydrogenation also proceeded via the PDH pathway on the defective surfaces in the presence of an oxygen vacancy, as shown inFigs. 4(b) and S5. At the beginning of the pathway, the interaction between propane and Zrcus is significantly strengthened compared with that on the pristine surfaces, as revealed by the COHP analysis shown in Fig. S7, which is beneficial for subsequent hydrogen abstraction. The most significant difference compared with the reaction on the pristine surfaces is the greatly reduced barrier of the first C–H bond activation, with calculated values of 0.47 and 0.49 eV on (100)-vac and (001)-vac, corresponding to reductions of 0.52 and 0.93 eV relative to those of the pristine surfaces, respectively. Not only the reaction barrier but also the active sites for C–H bond activation were changed to Zrcus around vacancies on (100)-vac and (001)-vac instead of the Zr–O pair on the pristine surfaces; therefore, the improved C–H activation ability is plausibly attributed to the high reactivity of Zrcus, due in part to its unsaturated coordination, which has also been discussed in previous studies [46]. The coordination number of Zr is 6 on the pristine surface, compared with 5 at the vacancy site. The better reactivity of the Zrcus site was also explained from the perspective of localized electrons within the vacancy, in addition to the coordination factor. As shown in Fig. S8, the localized electron was transferred to the propane molecule and induced breakage of the C–H bond. First, propane adsorption induced redistribution of the localized electron within the vacancy, and the localized charge attacked the C–H bond in the transition state; the charge was subsequently diminished after the C–H bond broke. Moreover, it was found that a greater charge, ca. 0.50 and 0.57 e on (001)-vac and (100)-vac, was transferred from the surface to the activated propane molecule in the transition state, which further verified the active role of the localized electron. The mechanism of C–H bond activation on the defective surfaces differed from that on the pristine surfaces as charge was transferred from the catalyst to the propane molecule, thereby injecting electrons to the antibonding orbital for activation. Overall, both the geometric and electronic factors contributed to the increased reactivity of Zrcus. However, the better reactivity of the defective surfaces was not maintained in the second C–H bond activation, as the calculated barriers were even larger than those on the pristine surfaces. This difference may arise because the neighboring oxygen abstracted hydrogen from C3H7* rather than from the Zrcus site. Another significant difference between the defective and pristine surfaces is the desorption of propene and hydrogen molecules. Because of the unsaturated coordination of Zrcus, the binding of propene and hydrogen is strong at the Zrcus site, hindering facile desorption. Overall, the comparison between the defective and pristine surfaces revealed that Zrcus shows improved reactivity towards the first C–H bond activation in the propane molecule due to unsaturated coordination and localized electrons within the vacancies. Conversely, however, the reactivity of Zrcus has an adverse effect on product desorption. 3.4 Microkinetic modeling The energetics and barriers of the reaction pathway alone cannot determine the performance of a catalyst and the related kinetic properties [47]. To deepen the understanding of propane dehydrogenation, a microkinetic simulation was performed by solving a differential equation consisting of related elementary steps, as shown in Fig. 5 and Table S1, which included both primary and secondary C–H bond activation and possible side reactions. The elementary steps considered in the microkinetic simulation included not only the dehydrogenation steps, but also the side reactions that led to unwanted intermediates and products, as indicated by the red color in Fig. 5. The TOF for propylene formation is the most important metric for evaluating the catalyst performance for dehydrogenation and was obtained from the microkinetic simulation for each investigated catalyst surface, as shown in Fig. 6 . First, the TOF increased with increasing temperature for all the investigated catalysts, which is consistent with the experimental observations [46]. This trend was more pronounced for the defective surfaces, possibly due to the enhanced desorption at high temperatures. The comparison between the pristine and defective surfaces revealed that the performance of the (001) and (100) planes reaches a crosspoint at approximately 650 and 750 K, respectively, whereas the pristine surface exhibits better performance at low temperatures. At a typical reaction temperature of 850 K, the TOF sequences from largest to smallest were (100)-vac, (001)-vac, (100), and (001). Overall, the TOF calculations verified the superior performance of defective surfaces compared with that of pristine surfaces at relevant temperatures, which suggests the active role of oxygen vacancies. DRC analysis was used to gain further insight into the reaction mechanism (Fig. 7 ), where a striking difference between the pristine and defective surfaces was observed. For the pristine surfaces, both the (001) and (100) surfaces possessed a single rate-determining step, which was identified as the first primary and secondary hydrogen abstraction, respectively, throughout the investigated temperature range. This is consistent with the conventional concept of C–H breakage as the most difficult step in propane dehydrogenation [48]. In contrast, no single determining step was found for the reaction on the defective surfaces; instead, several steps are associated with noticeable DRC values. However, for both defective surfaces, the most influential step is formation of the hydrogen molecule, and the significance of C–H bond breakage is significantly decreased. This observation is consistent with the barrier calculations, which showed that the defective surfaces greatly reduce the barrier of the first C–H bond breakage, whereas formation and desorption of the hydrogen molecule became difficult steps with a large barrier. Note that the DRC values for formation of the hydrogen molecule on both defective surfaces decreased with increasing temperature, which suggests that formation and desorption of the hydrogen molecule are enhanced at elevated temperature. Therefore, the DRC analysis clearly demonstrates the difference in the reaction mechanism between the pristine and defective surfaces. This dynamic evolution of the mechanism has been observed in a previous study on Pt clusters in propane dehydrogenation [49]. In that study, product desorption was identified as the rate-determining step for small clusters, whereas the dehydrogenation step was rate determining for large clusters. Therefore, both the literature report and the current study agree that no single factor determines the reaction rate for propane dehydrogenation due to the varying mechanisms depending on the catalyst structure. The reaction order of propane followed different trends, as shown in Fig. S9. For the pristine surfaces, the reaction order was almost equal to one, indicating that propene formation is first-order and dependent on the propane pressure, which is consistent with the stoichiometry of the reaction formula. On the other hand, the reaction order of propane on the defective surfaces exhibited an increasing trend with increasing temperature but did not reach unity even at the highest temperature. Therefore, propene formation is not solely determined by propane adsorption and activation, which seems to be consistent with the DRC analysis, as there is more than one determining step. The above analysis clearly shows distinct features for the reaction mechanism on the pristine and defective surfaces. Therefore, further improvements in the performance of ZrO2 catalysts for PDH should focus on facilitating the formation and desorption of hydrogen molecules. One possibly effective method is the introduction of a second active material to form a tandem catalyst that is responsible for hydrogen molecule combustion, which will push the reaction forward. This approach has been proven to be beneficial for increasing both the propylene yield and catalyst stability from literature reports [50,51]. 4 Conclusions The catalytic performance of pristine and defective ZrO2 (001) and (100) surfaces in propane dehydrogenation was critically compared based on DFT calculations and microkinetic simulations, which uncovered the distinct features associated with adsorption, C–H bond activation, and the reaction mechanism, as indicated below. (1) The improved chemical reactivity of the Zrcus site is clearly revealed by calculations of the adsorption energy of the reactants. Notably, the propene-adsorption energy is significantly increased on defective surfaces compared with that on pristine surfaces, which also hinders the desorption of H2 and propene. (2) The C–H bond activation in propane is mainly attributed to the attack of localized electrons within oxygen vacancies on the defective surfaces, and electrons are transferred from the catalyst to propane; conversely, electrons are transferred from propane to the catalyst on the pristine surfaces. (3) The calculated TOF for propene formation clearly exhibited two temperature ranges, in which either the pristine or defective surfaces exhibited better performance, which resulted from the different reaction mechanisms, as revealed by DRC and reaction-order analyses. Overall, the current work highlights the crucial effects of localized electron-steered dehydrogenation and uncovers the differences in the adsorption properties, C–H bond activation, and reaction mechanism at the molecular level from comparison of pristine and defective surfaces. The results provide key insights for improving the performance of hydrogenation catalysts through effective release of the hydrogen molecules formed during the reaction.

        "dc:description": "ABSTRACT Recent studies have revealed the extraordinary performance of zirconium oxide in propane dehydrogenation, which is attributed to the excellent reactivity of the coordinatively unsaturated zirconium sites (Zrcus) around the oxygen vacancies. The origin of the enhanced catalytic activity of ZrO2 with defective tetrahedral Zr sites was examined by direct comparison with its pristine counterpart in the current study. Electronic-structure analysis revealed that electrons from oxygen removal were localized within vacancies on the defective surface, which directly attacked the C–H bond in propane. The involvement of localized electrons activates the C–H bond via back-donation to the antibonding orbital on the defective surface; conversely, charge is transferred from propane to the pristine surfaces. The barrier for the first C–H bond activation is clearly significantly reduced on the defective surfaces compared to that on the pristine surfaces, which verifies the superior activity of Zrcus. Notably, however, the desorption of both propene and hydrogen molecules from Zrcus is more difficult due to strong binding. The calculated turnover frequency (TOF) for propene formation demonstrates that the pristine surfaces exhibit better catalytic performance at lower temperatures, whereas the defective surfaces have a larger TOF at high temperatures. However, the rate-determining step and reaction order on the defective surface differ from those on the pristine surface, which corroborates that the catalysts follow different mechanisms. A further optimization strategy was proposed to address the remaining bottlenecks in propane dehydrogenation on zirconium oxide.",
