Pmnavala Department of Chemistry, Michigan State University, East Lansing, M! 48823, USA Received 16 July 1997; received in revised form 3 October 1997; accepted 4 October 1997 Abstract Catalysts derived from Mg2A1 layered double hydroxides (LDHs) intercalated by polyoxometalates (POMs) of molybdenum and tungsten have been previously reported to exhibit substrate shape selectivity in condensed phase olefin oxidations. On the basis of X-ray powder diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and nitrogen adsorption studies of these and related Zn2A1-LDH-POM systems, the present work elucidates the catalyst precursors in terms of mixtures of salt-like and interlayered LDH phases containing M07064 and W7064. Under the conditions used to dry the precursors prior to catalysis (120), the LDH components are transformed into layered decomposition products that act as the active catalysts. Substrate selectivity based on the preferred access to the intragallery sites of pillared LDH phases is precluded under catalytic conditions. Even a structurally stable Zn2A1-HzWIzO460-LDH catalyst lacks the intragallery microporosity needed for shape selective substrate access to intragallery active sites under condensed phase reaction conditions. Other factors, perhaps selective adsorption based on substrate polarity, are responsible for the observed selectivity. ~: 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) intercalated with polyoxometalate (POM) anions hold promise for applications in industrial and environmental cata- lysis [1]. Sometimes designated 'anionic clays' or 'hydrotalcite-like' clays, LDHs are the only general class of materials which contain exchangeable anions between charged layersBrucite-like in structure, LDHs may be viewed as infinite sheets of MZ+(OH)2 in which the substitution by trivalent metal cations introduces a positive charge balanced by inter- *Corresponding author. layer anions. The general formula for an LDH is 2+ 3+ n [M~I_x)Mx (OH)zlAx/n.mH20. Naturally occurring hydrotalcite has the composition [Mg6A12(OH)I6]- CO3.4H20. Applications as diverse as fine chemical synthesis, photochemical NOx reduction, and water pollution might be all accomplished using LDH-POM catalysts. Examples of POM chemistry applied to catalysis include the oxidation of alkanes, phenols and olefins, C-C bond cleavage of vic-diols, the epoxidation of alkenes, allylic acetoxylations, forming glycerol from allylic alcohols, and gluteraldehyde from cyclopen- tene [2]. POM chemistry can be also environmentally relevant, particularly when it is applied to non-pollut- 0926-860X/98/$19.00 (~5 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. PII S0926-860X(97)00299-8 66 E. Gardner, ZJ. Pinnavaia/Applied Catalysis A: General 167 (1998) 65-74 ing 'green technology' or to remediation methods to clean polluted segments of the environment. An exam- ple of an application to green technology is their use as a highly selective, multifunctional and reusable cata- lyst in the production of wood pulp into paper [3]. The decontamination of water by photocatalytic decom- position of organic pollutants, such as aromatic and 4 3- chlorinated hydrocarbons by W10032, PW120:,0, and SiW1204o, is an example of their potential use for environmental remediation [4]. The first preparation of an LDH-POM intercalate was achieved by an anion exchange reaction of dec- avanadate (Vi006~) and Keggin ions (XM120~0) with an acidic Zn2AI-NO3 [5]. Since then several strate- gies for the intercalation of POMs have been advanced. In the method developed by Drezdon [6], large organic ions were used to separate the layers, facilitating POM exchange. Chibwe and Jones [7] used a calcined Mg2A1-CO2 to form a metal oxide precursor which was rehydrated to from meixnerite, a Mg2AI-LDH intercalated with OH . This was fol- lowed by anion exchange with the desired POM. Narita et al. later showed this to be a general method [8] and in 1990, Dimotakis [9] showed that meixnerite could be swelled with glycols to facilitate POM anion exchange reactions. Wang et al. [10] extended the anion exchange of POMs over a range of AI substitu- tion in MgA1 and NiA1-LDHs and was able to inter- calate Keggin ions (XMj20]o) with n<6. Direct synthesis of LDH-POMs [11] was finally followed by the intercalation of larger POMs such as Dawson and Finke ions by Sang and Pinnavaia [12]. In practice, POM intercalated LDHs have not yet reached their anticipated potential as heterogeneous catalysts. Substrate size- and shape-selective effects are expected for LDH-POM intercalates that are pillared. However, pillaring requires lateral separation between the intragallery anions to allow for substrate access. In the absence of pillaring, only the POMs at the edges of the LDH layers are available for catalysis. So far, only one study has been reported concerning the shape selectivity for an LDH-POM catalytic reaction. Tatsumi et al. were the first to suggest substrate shape selectivity for LDH catalysts interlayered by polyoxomolybdate and -tungstate anions [13]. The active phases were identified as Mg2A1-LDHs of heptamolybdate, [Mg 12A16(OH)36]MovO24.mH20, and paratungstate B (dodecatungstate), [Mg2oAl~o- (OH)6o]H2W12042-mH20. Both intercalates were better catalysts for the oxygenation of 2-hexene than the unsupported POMs. More importantly, for the epoxidation of 2-hexene and cyclohexene, the inter- calated POMs were 4-6 times more selective in favor of the smaller 2-hexene substrate than the homoge- neous catalysts. Encouraged by the substrate selectivity effects reported by Tatsumi et al., we initiated the present study with the intent of extending the selective oxida- tion catalysis of LDH-POM to include acidic Zn~AI- LDH hosts. In contrast to basic Mg2A1-POMs, Zn2AI- derivatives can be formed at acidic pH values where many POM anions are stable. Consequently, hydro- lysis reactions between the POM and LDH host are less likely to occur. However, as we report in the present work, the synthetic method used to prepare the original catalysts affords products that are much more complex than previously realized. Our results also indicate that the relevant Mg2A1-LDH phases are structurally unstable even under relatively mild con- ditions. In contrast, the acidic Zn2A1-LDH phases are more stable, particularly when the gallery anion is the relatively robust H2W1206o Keggin ion. Even in this latter case, however, substrate shape selectivity is precluded by the lack of intracrystalline microporosity under condensed phase reaction conditions. 2. Experimental 2.1. Physical measurements Raman spectra in the region 1200-200 cm-j were recorded on a BIO-RAD FT Raman spectrometer equipped with a Spectra-Physics Topaz T10-106c 1.064 nm YAG laser and a Ge detector. The samples were ground into a fine powder and loaded into glass sampling tubes. X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained with a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer equipped with DMAXB software, a curved graphite monochromator and CuK~ radiation. Samples were either thin films on glass slides formed by evaporation of an LDH slurry or dried samples ground into a fine powder. Proton NMR spectra of the cyclohexene oxidation products were recorded on a VXR 300 or VXR 500s spectrometer. The delay time between pulses was long E. Gardner, T.J.

Elemental analyses were performed by ICP emis- sion at the Toxicology Laboratory at MSU. Solutions for analysis were prepared by dissolving 15 mg of solid in 100 ml of 15% HNO3. 2.2. Catalyst synthesis by in situ POM hydrolysis and LDH-terephthalate exchange A Mg2Al-terephthalate LDH was prepared accord- ing to the methods followed by Drezdon and Tatsumi et al. [6,13] and stored as a suspension in degassed- deionized water. The terephthalate-intercalated LDH was converted to the desired POM intercalate accord- ing to the procedure used by Tatsumi et al. [13]. Na2MoO4 (25.4g, 0.105 mol) or Na2WO4 (27.7 g, 0.84 mol) was added to 200 ml of the Mg2Al-ter- ephthalate slurry and then the pH was lowered to 4.4 with 2 M NaOH. After 10-15 rain of additional stirring, the product was washed 4 times by centrifu- ging and resuspending the pellet in deionized water. A thin film sample was made, and the remainder was dried at 120. Mg2AI-Mo70~4-XRD (A): 10.2, impurity; 6.08, (002); 4.03, (003); 3.03, (004); 2.44, (005); and 1.99 A, (006).

[15], was used to prepare a stable, highly ordered nitrate- intercalated ZnzA1-LDH. Even though the reaction is not very sensitive to carbonate contamination through exposure to CO2 in the air, N2 was bubbled into the reaction mixture, but no other steps were taken to prevent contact with air. The pH of a 200ml solution of 0.1M Al(NO3)3.9H20 in a 1 1 three neck round bottom flask was adjusted to 7.0 with 2 M NaOH. The white slurry was stirred for 1 h, and then 200ml of 0.3 M Zn(NO3)2.6H20 was added dropwise. As the Zn2+ solution is added, the pH was allowed to fall to 6.4 and then maintained at that level with the simultaneous addition of 2 M NaOH. Upon complete addition of the zinc nitrate solution, the temperature was raised to 95 and digested with gentle stirring for one week. The product was rinsed four times by centrifuging. After the final rinse, the pellet was resuspended in 500 ml water. In order to maintain a supply of Zn2A1-NO3 for subsequent anion exchange experiments, the above slurry was purged with N2 and stored in a stoppered single neck round bottom flask. There was no degra- dation of the LDH over a several month period. XRD (A): 8.93, (001); 4.46, (002); 2.97, (003); 2.82; 2.61, and 2.48. 2.4. Zn2Al-MoT064 and Zn2A1-H2W12064o-LDHs 100 ml of Zn2A1-NO3-LDH slurry was heated to 95 and dripped into 100 ml of a 1.2x 10-2 M solu- tion of (NH4)rMovO24.4H20 or (NH4)6H2W1204o 4H~O at room temperature and pH 5.1 and 4.3, respectively. The pH of the solution was too low for carbonate contamination to be a significant pro- blem, so there was no attempt to prevent exposure to air. The solution was allowed to stir for 90 min and rinsed three times by centrifugation and resuspended in 100 ml deionized water. After the final rinse, the pellet was resuspended in 100 ml deionized water and digested for 18 h at 80. A thin film sample was made for the X-ray diffraction analysis, and the remainder was dried at room temperature. Powder samples were made from the dried product.

Oxidation of cyclohexene Oxidation reactions of cyclohexene were carried out according to the previously described methods of Tatsumi et al [13]. The catalyst (1 mmol of W or Mo) and 100 mmol of cyclohexene were stirred at 73in an oil bath. 100 mmol of 10% H202 in (BuO)3PO was slowly dripped into the mixture of substrate and catalyst and the reaction was stirred at 73 for a 68 E.

The products were identified by Total Correlation Spectroscopy (TOCSY) NMR, also known as homonuclear Harman-Hahn (HOHAHA) NMR, using purchased standards as reference sam- ples. Yields were calculated from NMR. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Catalyst synthesis and characterization The substrate-selective LDH-molybdate catalyst reported by Tatsumi et al. [13] was prepared by the in situ hydrolysis of Na2MoO4-2H20, a method ori- ginally developed by Drezdon [6]. As the pH of the molybdate solution is lowered, heptamolybdate forms in solution and undergoes ion exchange reaction with the LDH-terephthalate. As shown by the X-ray dif- fraction patterns in Fig. 1 (a), the product as a thin film contains sharp 001 reflections characteristic of the Mg2A1-Mo70:46- System , t a.~ L~,,j' Thin film 25 - t'N \"~ Powder 25 _= 10 20 30 40 50 2-theta/degrees Fig. 1.

The 001 reflection is buried under a broad impurity peak at ~10.2 A. The XRD pattern is consistent with a mixture of an authentic Mg2Al-Mo7064-LDH phase and a salt-like Mg2+- or A13+-POM impurity phase. When the XRD pattern of the reaction product is obtained for an unoriented powder sample (Fig. l(b)) rather than a film, the impurity phase reflection increases greatly relative to the LDH phase. That is, the preferred orientations of the LDH platelets in a thin film sample masks the salt-like impurity. The ratio of Mg : A1 : Mo by ICP analysis is 1.7 : 1.0 : 0.82, whereas the expected ratio is 2.00: 1.00: 1.17. These values do not give an accurate indication of the Mg : AI : Mo ratio in the LDH phase, because the impurity also adds to the total metal content. In the catalytic oxidation studies reported by Tat- sumi, the LDH-molybdate catalyst had been dried at 120'C before use. The X-ray diffraction pattern of the Mg2A1-MoTO64-LDH dried at 120:C shows an unex- pected result (Fig. l(c)). The heptamolybdate inter- calated LDH component undergoes decomposition at this temperature, as indicated by the disappearance of the 002 and 003 reflections, whereas the salt-like impurity phase is unaffected by heating at 120~C. Raman spectroscopy was used in order to identify the intercalated anion and the impurity salt obtained as the major components of the MgzAI-MoTO64 reaction products (Fig. 2). Previous work [16] has shown that as the pH of a MoO4- solution is reduced from an initial value of 11.0 to 4.2, the anion is progressively converted to heptamolybdate as the only other POM species in solution. The MoO4 anion exhibits a Raman Mo=Ot stretching frequency at 898 cm 1 and a Mo=O bending frequency at 320 cm ~. Hepta- molybdate is readily distinguished from molybdate by a Mo=Ot symmetric stretch at 947 cm ~, a Mo=O bend at 340 cm-j, and a Mo-O-Mo deformation at 220 cm- ~. The Raman spectrum of the reaction pro- duct formed by the in situ MoO2- hydrolysis and exchange reaction with MgzAl-terephthalate matched closely with the spectrum of solid (NH4)MovO24. The presence of heptamolybdate as the only Raman-iden- tifiable POM suggests that the relatively large fraction of the impurity phase formed in the Mg2A1-Mo70~4 reaction system is a magnesium/aluminum salt of Mo7064.

[13] also used the in situ hydrolysis method to prepare a substrate-selective catalyst, which was identified as a paratungstate B (MgzA1- H~W1201)-LDH intercalate, for the peroxide oxi- dation of olefins. As shown by the XRD patterns in Fig. 3, however, the product by this reaction route is a mixture of two phases with XRD properties similar to those found for the analogous molybdate product (Fig. 1). The d spacing of the minor Mg2A1-LDH component is 12.1 A, and the salt-like impurity phase gives a peak at 10.1 A. The observed Mg : A1 : W molar ratio of 1.8 : 1.0 : 0.74 is close to the calculated ratio of 2.0 : 1.0 : 0.83, but, again, the elemental ratio is not an accurate indication of the LDH composition due to the large amount of impurity presentAlso, the 12.1 ]~ d spacing for the MgzAl-isopolytungstate phase is not consistent with the previously reported literature value of 14.6 ,~ for H2W120~ intercalated into an LDH [15]. Drying the isopolytungstate catalyst at 120 results in the decomposition of the LDH component (see Fig. 3(c)). This result is also incom- u ,,~,. ,qn) intercalated LDH phase, patible with a ~2,* 12u42 because such intercalates previously have been shown to be stable at 220 [15].

At pH 9, the predominant species is WO] . As the solution is acidified, W7064 is rapidly formed at pH 5 to 6. The WvO64 ion, which is in equilibrium with lo H2W12042 , is converted primarily to H2W12O10 at pH 4.4. Although we were not able to distinguish between these isopolytungstate possibili- ties by Raman spectroscopy, the X-ray spacing of 12.1 A (Fig. 3) suggests that WvO64 is the interca- lated anion in the Mg2AI-LDH component of Tatsu- mi's catalyst. Apparently, the W70262 anion rapidly exchanges with the Mg2Al-terephthalate as soon as it is formed in the in situ hydrolysis reaction and is stabilized in the LDH galleries at a pH where H2WI2O10 would normally form. By further analogy to the molybdate system, we assign the impurity phase as a salt of the W7064 anion. From the above results, we conclude that neither the isopolymolybdate nor the isopolytungstate catalyst used in the earlier selective epoxidation studies con- tains a POM intercalated LDH phaseInstead, the initial catalysts consist of salt-like M7064 phases that are present as an initial impurity and decomposition products that were formed as a result of the thermal decomposition of the LDH component when dried at 120. In order to obtain stable LDH systems, authen- tic Zn2AI-POMs were synthesized, wherein the 70 E. Gardner; T.J.

Well crystallized Zn2A1-Mo7064 and -H2W120460-LDH intercalates were prepared by the anion exchange of the ammonium POM salt with Zn2AI-NO3 [14] using the method developed by Kwon and Pinnavaia [15], with only slight modifica- tions. The Zn2AI-NO3 suspension was formed at 95 and then the anion exchange reaction was con- ducted at the ambient pH of the aqueous POM solu- tion. In addition, an 18 h digestion period at 80:C was performed, which was especially helpful for promot- ing the Mo7064 exchange. In general, the digestion step is desirable, because it helps in producing con- sistently well-ordered intercalated products, as judged by XRD (Fig. 4). A 12.1 ,~ d spacing for Zn2AI- Mo7064 was obtained by averaging the values from five orders of (001) reflections (Fig. 4(a)). Analysis by ICP gave the ratio of Zn : AI : Mo as 2.0 : 1.0 : 1.1 which was very close to the expected ratio of 2.00 : 1.00 : 1.17. The Raman spectrum of the Zn2A1-Mo7064-LDH product showed the presence of bands at 950, 360 and 220cm-1 (Table 1) which was in good agreement with the Raman spectrum of crystalline (NH4)MoTO24. The Raman data, together with the ICP and X-ray diffraction measurements (Fig. 4) are consistent with a well defined intercalated product. In fact, the X-ray diffraction pattern of the oriented thin film of Zn2A1-Mo7064 (Fig. 4(a)) gives a text- book LDH diffraction pattern with sharp, intense (001) peaks. However, when the pattern of a less oriented powder sample is recorded, an impurity peak, though relatively weak in intensity, becomes clearly evident at a d spacing of 10.8 ,& (Fig. 4(b)). Thus, as emphasized earlier, thin film samples can mask the presence of an impurity phase by enhancing the (001) reflections of the LDH phase through preferred orien- tation of the platy crystallites. Although the X-ray diffraction pattern, ICP elemental analyses, and Raman spectrum for the Zn2A1-Mo7064 intercalate verified that the initial gallery anion is heptamolyb- date, this intercalate also decomposes when dried at 120 (Fig. 4(c)).

A Raman study was also carried out for the thermal decomposition for the relatively pure Zn2Al- MovO64-LDH phase (Fig. 5). The important Raman features, given in Table 1, are the (M=Ot) Usym band above 900 cm-1, and the Mo-O-Mo deformation band at 220 cm t. The spectrum of ZnzA1-MoTO264 dried at 105 shows a splitting of the (M=Ot) Usym stretch (950, 919 cm-1) and the (M=Ot) bend (360, 317 cm-1), respectively. The Mo-O-Mo deformation frequency does not change significantly in wavelength or intensity. By 220, the bands have shifted to 936, 341 and 206 cm i. The sample dried at 220 was slurried in water to determine if rehydration would return the layer spacing to that of the original LDH intercalate. Ordered reflections for a layered material with a d spacing of 9.6 ,~ were observed. The Raman spectra of the rehydrated product has the most intense band at 922 cm-1 and low intensity, broad bands near 320 and 200 cm-1. The spectrum is similar to those reported for the Raman bands arising from the AI-O- Mo linkages in rehydrated MoO3 supported on alu- mina [17], which suggests that the decomposition product contains similar linkages. There is no evi- dence for the survival or reformation of the heptamo- lybdate anion. Thus, the changes in XRD properties upon heating to 220 are not simply due to the loss of gallery water, but to the transformation of the LDH- POM structure itself. In a related Raman study of LDH heptamolybdates, Twu and Dutta [18] concluded that the LDH layers degraded at 200, while the integrity of the heptamolybdate was maintained at 400. A Keggin ion intercalated Zn2A1-H2WI206o-LDH was also prepared by the same general ion exchange reaction between the POM salt and the Zn2A1-NO;-- LDH precursor. The molar Zn : A1 : W ratio for the reaction product was 2.1:1.0:2.2, close to the expected 2.0:1.0:2.0 ratio, but still with some impurity present. The d-spacing for the LDH was 14.6 A, in good agreement with the sum of 4.8 for an LDH layer and 9.8A for a Keggin ion (Fig. 6(a)). However, a salt-like impurity was also present, as indicated by the broad peak at 11.1 A. For this LDH intercalate, there is no change in the diffraction pattern when it is dried at 120cC (Fig. 6(b, c)). The identification of the intercalate as an H2W1206o anion, was based on the ICP elemental analysis, d spacing, and thermal stability, all of which are in agreement with previous literature results [15]. In the present work only the ZnzA1-H2W12046o- LDH intercalate was stable when dried at 120~C. Although the LDH structure is retained, the intragal- lery POM anions are not accessible for reaction with olefinic substrates in solution. Not even N2 is capable of accessing the space between the solvated gallery anions, as judged by the absence of microporosity and low surface area when the LDH is dried at the cata- lytically relevant temperature of 70 (see below). Fig. 7 presents the N2 adsorption isotherm and N2 BET surface area for the ZnzAl-HzWlzO460-LDH. Included for comparison is the isotherm and surface area for MgzA1-W7064. Both materials exhibit iso- therms characteristic of non-porous (solvated) struc- tures. It should be noted, however, that Zn2AI- H2W120460 is microporous, indeed pillared, when outgassed under vacuum at 150, in accord with 72 E. Gardner, T.J.

All of the heptametallate LDH intercalates are unstable under reaction conditions and are transformed into lower nuclearity species on the LDH surface. Only the Zn2AI-H2WI2046i~ intercalate is stable under reaction conditions. The AI-POM salt was made by the reaction of AI(NO?)3 and (NH4)6H2WI2040 under the conditions analogous to those used to prepare Zn2A1 H2W120406 -LDH. prepared by the in situ hydrolysis method of Tatsumi et al., are indeed active for the peroxide oxidation of cyclohexene to the corresponding epoxide and diol in (BuO)3PO solution. Included in Table 2 for compar- ison purposes are the results for the unsupported catalyst precursors, (NH4)6M07024 and (NH4)6H2- W12040 as well as for the Zn2A1-LDH derivatives prepared by the direct ion exchange of Zn2A1-NO3-. No olefin oxidation products were detected in the absence of a POM catalyst or in the presence of a Mg2A1-LDH in which carbonate is the gallery anion. The results given in Table 2 show that the LDH intercalates are far less reactive than the unsupported catalysts. This is consistent with the inaccessibility of E. Gardner, T.J. Pinnavaia/Applied Catalysis A: General 167 (1998) 65-74 73 the gallery POM centers under reaction conditions. It is highly unlikely that the activities observed for the LDH catalysts are due to the leaching of the POM ions into the solution. LDH intercalates have virtually no solubility in (BuO)3PO and no anions are generated in the oxidation reaction for displacing POM ions from the LDH surfaces. The epoxide and diol product selectivities also differ for the intercalated and unsupported catalysts. For instance H2W12060, which forms a stable Zn2A1 intercalate under reaction conditions, gives exclu- sively diol when intercalated in a Zn2A1-LDH and a mixture of epoxide and diol when used as an unsupported catalyst. The surface acid-base proper- ties of the LDH may promote ring opening of the epoxide to the diol. On the basis of the X-ray powder diffraction results described above, the MgzA1-Mo70264 and W7064- LDH precursors decompose when heated to 120. The decomposition products are not substantially altered under reaction conditions (see parts (c), (d)) in Fig. 1 and Fig. 3). Because Tatsumi et al. dried their Mg2A1-LDH catalysts at 120 prior to use for olefin oxidation in (BuO)3PO solution, we may conclude that it was the LDH decomposition products and not the initial Mg2A1-POM-LDH phases that were responsible for favoring 2-hexene oxidation over cyclohexene oxidation relative to the unsupported POMs. Drying the MgzAI-LDH precursors at room temperature instead of 120 does not preserve the LDH structure under catalytic reaction conditions. In fact, when air-dried MgzA1-MoTO64 was merely stir- red in cyclohexene at 75 for 3 h, the result was a loss of ordered reflections for the Mg2A1-MovO64-LDH phase. The phase formed under the conditions of catalytic oxidation is uncertain, but the X-ray powder pattern, shown in Fig. 4(d), is consistent with a layered structure, perhaps a MoO2 -LDH intercalate. However, this layered phase is no more reactive for cyclohexene oxidation than the decomposition pro- duct obtained from the corresponding Mg2AI-LDH precursor (Table 2). In the present work only the Zn2A1-H2W12060- LDH derivative was stable toward both to drying at 120 and to olefin oxidation conditions (see Fig. 4(c), (d)). Although most of the intercalated POM anions in this intercalate are inaccessible to the substrate under catalytic reaction conditions, sig- nificant activity is observed. This suggests that the accessible POM sites at the outer LDH surfaces are more reactive than unsupported POMs. But even this catalyst in as-synthesized form contained a salt-like impurity phase that was observable by XRD. The salt- like impurity cannot be ignored as a potential olefin oxidation catalyst. In an effort to demonstrate the possible role this impurity phase in the catalytic process, we prepared an aluminum salt of HzW12060 by precipitation reaction of Al(NO3)3 and (NH4)6H2WI204o. The precipitate gave an X- ray diffraction pattern similar to the impurity phase found in ZnzA1-H2W12060. Table 2 shows that the A1-H2W12060 salt is reactive for the oxidation of cyclohexene to the corresponding diol. Consequently, the role of the salt-like impurity phases as contributors to the catalytic properties cannot be discounted, par- ticularly for the MgzAI systems where these impurity phases are an abundant component. 4. Conclusions The results of the present study clarify the nature of the catalyst precursors used in the earlier work of Tatsumi et al. in terms of mixed phases of salt-like POM impurities and MgzA1-LDH intercalates inter- layered by Mo70264 and W7062. Moreover, the Mg2AI-POM-LDH components of the as-synthesized catalysts decompose at the temperatures used to dry the intercalates prior to the catalytic reaction. Despite the thermal instability of MgzA1-POM intercalates, the substrate selectivity effects observed by Tatsumi for the decomposition products are nonetheless impressive. For instance, the preference of the Mg2A1-POM catalyst precursor systems for the epoxi- dation of 2-hexane in the presence of cyclohexene as a co-substrate was enhanced 4 to 6 fold relative to the unsupported catalysts. The origin of the enhanced substrate selectivity, however, cannot be attributed to molecular sieving based on the substrate size of shape, because the intercalated structure of the LDH is lost after drying and used as a catalyst. Moreover, even if the LDH-POM structure was retained, shape selec- tivity effects based on sieving would not be expected because of limited access to the solvated gallery anions under reaction conditions. Factors other than pillaring and substrate size selectivity, such as selec- 74 E. Gardner, T.J. Pinnavaia/Applied Catalysis A: General 167 (1998) 65 74 rive adsorption, may be responsible for the previously observed preference of LDH-POM catalysts toward smaller olefins.

Pinnavaia * Department of Chemistry, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48823, USA * Corresponding author. Catalysts derived from Mg2Al layered double hydroxides (LDHs) intercalated by polyoxometalates (POMs) of molybdenum and tungsten have been previously reported to exhibit substrate shape selectivity in condensed phase olefin oxidations. On the basis of X-ray powder diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and nitrogen adsorption studies of these and related Zn2Al-LDH-POM systems, the present work elucidates the catalyst precursors in terms of mixtures of salt-like and interlayered LDH phases containing Mo7O24 6− and W7O24 6−. Under the conditions used to dry the precursors prior to catalysis (120°C), the LDH components are transformed into layered decomposition products that act as the active catalysts. Substrate selectivity based on the preferred access to the intragallery sites of pillared LDH phases is precluded under catalytic conditions. Even a structurally stable Zn2AlH2W12O40 6−-LDH catalyst lacks the intragallery microporosity needed for shape selective substrate access to intragallery active sites under condensed phase reaction conditions. Other factors, perhaps selective adsorption based on substrate polarity, are responsible for the observed selectivity.
