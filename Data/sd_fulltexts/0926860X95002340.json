In addition to a previous characterization by XRD, DRS and XPS, the catalysts have been characterized here by DRS, FTIR spectroscopy in their oxide state and by FFIR spectroscopy of NO chemisorbed on the sulphided catalysts. A promoting effect of phosphorus is observed in all phosphorus containing samples. The catalytic activity vs. phosphorus content curve has a complex behavior passing through a maximum and a minimum. Phase transitions are observed in the samples with the change of the phosphorus content. The form of the catalytic activity curve is discussed in the light of these phase transitions and the structure and properties of the different phases. The highest catalytic activity is observed for the sample with 0.6% P205. This sample is also characterized by the highest amount of chemisorbed NO and by a local maximum in the relative number of terminal W=O bonds. When strong overlapping of the bands is observed, the NO adsorption technique should be applied with care. Also, NO might adsorb on sites which are not active in the corresponding hydrotreatment reaction and the trend predicted by the total amount of chemisorbed NO should not necessarily coincide with the form of the catalytic activity * Corresponding author.

Introduction In the search of new and better catalysts for hydrotreatment reactions, different approaches are applied, such as the use of mixed oxides as supports, modification of the supports by controlled porosity, changes of the surface properties of the supports by the introduction of electron acceptor elements such as fluoride, introduction of a second promotor in addition to the conventional Ni or Co promoters or variations in each step of the catalysts' preparation (se- quence of introduction of the components, pH of the impregnation solution, calcination temperatures, etc.). One of the second promoters that have attracted much attention recently is phosphorus. It has been shown in a number of papers, that the introduction of phosphorus to promoted and unpromoted molybdenum based hydrotreating catalysts enhances the HDS, HDN and HYD activities, depending on phospho- rus concentration and preparation method ([1-9] and references therein). The tungsten based systems have been much less studied than the molybde- num based systems and generally the conclusions are made in analogy with the molybdenum catalysts. The stronger interaction between tungsten and the sup- port in comparison to molybdenum, hence, the differences in reducibility and sulfidability, have been pointed out in [10-14]. The effect of the pH of the impregnation solution and the type of tungsten distribution on the support have been studied in detail in [14,15]. The state of nickel and tungsten in Ni-W/A1203 systems has been reported in a number of papers [16-19]. The effect of phosphorus on the structure and properties of Ni-W/AI203 catalysts has been studied in a limited number of papers [20-26]. In a previous paper [27], we reported the results from the physical characterization and the phase composition of a series of P-Ni-W/AI203 catalysts of low tungsten concentration (1.6 W atoms/nm2) prepared by co-impregnation, at pH 1, aqueous oxalic acid being used as a solvent of the tungsten salt- (NH4)10H2(W207)6 \"xH20. The same series of catalysts is studied in the present paper. Here we would like to briefly review the basic previous conclu- sions as obtained by XRD, DRS, IR and XPS studies of this series of catalysts. Phosphorus interacts with the support to form AIPO4-1ike species which serve as a modified support for the nickel and tungsten species. The distribution of phosphorus is monolayer up to concentrations of I P atom/nm2. The addition of increasing quantities of phosphorus leads to a linear decrease of the BET surface area of the catalysts due to blocking of the pores and the corrosive action of the T. Halachev et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 136 (1996) 161-175 163 phosphoric acid. The distribution of tungsten and nickel is inhomogeneous and strongly depends on the phosphorus concentration. The preparation conditions applied lead to the formation of NiO crystallites which are present in all samples. At low phosphorus content a phase of WO3 is observed, which, with the increase of the phosphorus concentration, gradually transforms into NiWO4 and WO3 is no longer XRD detectable. However, as will be discussed below, the presence of a highly dispersed WO3 phase in the high phosphorus content catalysts cannot be excluded. We would also like to mention that the catalysts present a complex mixture of different compounds of the active components, the concentration of which varies as a function of the phosphorus content. Here, we would like to point out the importance of the preparation method and of the pH applied in the preparation of these samples. In another series of P-Ni-W/AI203 catalysts [23] where the preparation conditions were different (pH 4, multiple step impregnation, different initial tungsten compound), highly dispersed catalysts, without XRD detectable phases, were obtained. Of course, one should expect that the catalytic properties of the two series of catalysts would be quite different. The majority of the catalytic activity studies on phosphorus promoted tung- sten based catalysts have been performed in the reaction of HDS. Therefore, in the present paper we report the results on the catalytic activity of the previously characterized series of catalysts [27] in the hydrogenation of naphthalene. Some additional characterization by FTIR spectroscopy of the oxide state of the samples and of NO adsorbed on the sulfided catalysts, as well as DRS results on the amounts of Nie+(Oh) and Ni2+(Td) are also reported. The complex shape of the catalytic activity curves vs. phosphorus content is discussed in terms of the phase transitions in the catalysts, as observed by the physical characterization methods. 2. Experimental The catalytic activity in the hydrogenation of naphthalene was carried out in a batch Parr reactor, charged with 0.1 g of the catalysts, 1 g of naphthalene dissolved in 30 ml of n-hexadecane and 0.01 ml of CS2 to maintain the catalysts in sulfided state. The catalysts were sulfided first in a flow reactor at 673 K for 4 h in a 15% HES/H2 mixture at flow rate of 20 ml//min. After the sulfidation was completed, the catalysts were cooled down to room temperature in a nitrogen flow and transferred to the batch reactor in a nitrogen atmosphere with the aim to avoid contact with air. After charging, the reactor was additionally purged with nitrogen to eliminate traces of oxygen. The reaction was carried out at P = 44 atm and T = 573 K for 8 h, at constant speed of agitation of the reaction mixture. The reaction products were analyzed by GC on a Perkin Elmer Sigma 2000 chromatograph using a 1.8 m long Carbowax on Cromosorb column 164 T.

A Perkin Elmer Sigma 15 integrator was used for numeric processing of the chromatographic results. The IR spectroscopy of adsorbed NO was carried out in an in situ cell with self-supporting wafers of the catalysts with thickness of 10 0.1 mg/cm2. Before recording the spectra the wafers were sulfided in the cell with a sulfidation mixture, consisting of 15% H2S/H2. The sulfidation of the samples was carried out at 673 K for 4 h at a flow rate of 20 ml/min. Then, the cell was cooled down to room temperature in a nitrogen flow. The cell with the sulfided wafer was evacuated at 723 K for 2 h, cooled down and then background and sample spectra were recorded at a residual pressure of 2-3 10-5 Torr. The samples were then exposed to pulses of 4 mm Hg NO and spectra were recorded. Then, the excess of NO was evacuated from the cell and spectra of the chemisorbed NO were recorded. The spectra were recorded on a Nicolet ZDX FTIR spectrometer working at a resolution of 4 cm-1 and scanning 200 times. The IR spectra of the oxide state of the samples were recorded on the same spectrometer using KBr pellets. Compensation of alumina absorption was used in the 1000-400 cm-1 range by substraction of a spectrum of an equivalent amount of carrier from the spectra of the samples. The diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded in the 250-2500 nm range on a UV-VIS-NIR Beckman spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere using BaSO4 as reference. Table 1 gives the composition of the samples. 3. Results and discussion Fig. 1 shows the initial pseudo-first order reaction rates of the catalysts as a function of the phosphorus content. The numerical method of Marquardt was used in the determination of the rate constants of the reactions. The curve has a complex shape, passing through a maximum for the sample with 0.6% P205 and through a minimum for the sample with 2.5% P205. Then, the activity increases again for the sample with the highest phosphorus content. All phosphorus containing samples manifest higher activity compared to the phosphorus free sample. The promoting effect of phosphorus is most strongly expressed for the T.

Fig. 2a contains the degrees of conversion of naphthalene measured after 3, 6 and 8 h. It is interesting to note the behavior of the two catalysts with the highest catalytic activity. After the sixth hour the conversion over these cata- lysts, which in the first hours was different, is practically the same. This implies that the catalyst with 1% P205 undergoes certain changes during the reaction, resulting in the formation of active sites, which are either more active or are in a larger number than the initial active sites. Indeed, the results of Fig. 2b indicate that after the fourth hour the catalyst with 1% P205 increases its activity, which is reflected by the change of the slope of the conversion vs. time curve. Therefore, it might be concluded that just the sulfidation procedure may not be enough for the formation of all active sites in hydrogenation. This observation is rather interesting and needs additional investigations. We should note that the idea that the active sites are formed and change during the hydrotreatment process has also been pointed out recently [28,29], where the theory of the 'remote control' has been revisited with some new and strong supports for its applicability. Since the first step in the hydrogenation of naphthalene to tetraline is rather fast (kl), it is of interest to follow the activity in the second steps of the reaction, where tetraline is converted to cis (k3) and trans (k2) decalines. Fig. 3 gives the ratio between the rate constant of hydrogenation to tetraline (k1) and the sum of the rate constants (k2 and k3). Fig. 3 gives not only the selectivity to tetraline but also an indication of the reaction rate of the second step of the reaction. Obviously, the activity order of the catalysts in the second step is the 166 T.

The lowest selectivity to tetraline, i.e., the highest activity in the second reaction step is observed for the catalyst with the highest hydrogenation activity -- P,0.6. It is rather tempting to explain the complex character of the catalytic activity vs. the phosphorus content curve with changes in the dispersion of the active components. However, it is difficult to explain the activity manifested by the T.

Indeed, for the latter sample the activity should have been rather low because of the presence of a large amount of NiWO4 and the rather poor dispersion [27] but, surprisingly, it has an activity which is close to that of the most active catalysts. At the same time, the sample with 2.5% P205, which has better dispersion, shows the lowest activity. Obvi- ously, the varying phosphorus content has different effects on the active components. Besides, the changes in the catalytic activity cannot be explained by changes in the surface area of the catalysts after introduction of phosphorus. Linear decrease in the surface area is observed with the increase in phosphorus content [27] which cannot account for the complex shape of the catalytic activity curve. Below, we present some additional characterization results of the cata- lysts, which allow a better insight in their structure and performance. Fig. 4 (curves a and b) gives the amounts of NO adsorbed during the pulse treatment of the samples, as measured by the intensity of the IR bands of NO 168 T.

It is interesting to note that the sample with 1% P205, which manifests much higher activity than the sample with 2.5% P205, adsorbs less NO than the latter. Obviously, the NO adsorption technique, which is often used to determine the total number of adsorption sites, although it sometimes correlates with the activity results, fails to predict correctly the activity of the sample with 1% P205. Similar discrepancies and the dangers in the application of this technique have been pointed out [30]. Fig. 4c represents the ratio between curves a and b and could serve as a measure of the promoting effect of Ni on the activity of W. Fig. 5 (curves a and b) gives the amounts of NO chemisorbed over the samples after outgassing the cell from the excess of the pulse of NO. The curves have practically the same form as in Fig. 4, but the intensity of the absorption bands is much lower, as the spectra in Fig. 6 indicate, especially, for the adsorption over the tungsten species. Most probably, at the high vacuum used to record the spectra, part of the adsorption complexes of NO with Ni and W decompose, which results in lower intensity of the absorption bands. One can also conclude that the adsorption complex of NO with nickel is more stable than that with tungsten. This conclusion is supported by the results presented in Table 2 which give the decrease (in %) of the IR intensity of the NO peak adsorbed on Ni and W species after outgassing the excess NO from the cell.

It has a high activity even during the first hours of the reaction, when the possible changes in its structure have not yet occurred, but the NO adsorption over it is the lowest. One could also look for other dependencies, such as, the coordination symmetry of nickel or its dispersion and distribution, in the search for an explanation of the observed catalytic activities. Fig. 7 shows the ratio between Ni2+(Oh) and Ni2+(Td) as obtained from the Kubelka-Munk's intensities of the DRS spectra of the samples. Indeed, all phosphorus containing samples manifest a higher content of Ni2+ (Oh), which could account, to a certain degree, for their higher catalytic activity, but the form of the curve is quite different from that of the catalytic activity. One could also conclude, upon comparison between this curve and the curves of the NO chemisorption, that the adsorption on the Ni2+(Oh) species is strongly impeded (the sample with 1% P205, which has the highest amount of Ni2Oh) manifests the lowest NO adsorption). Besides, Fig. 10 in [27] indicates, that the sample with 2.5% I)205, which in our 1.6 F(ROh) F(RTd) 1.4 1.2 Z 1.0 I I I I :x 0.8 I I I I 0 2 4 6 8 I0 P/ALX 102 Fig. 7.

Halachev et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 136 (1996) 161-175 171 case shows a low activity, has the highest dispersion and homogeneity, close to the monolayer distribution of nickel, as evaluated by XPS measurements. Therefore, the activity cannot be explained just by the dispersion of nickel, its symmetry and distribution over the support. Also, the results shown on Fig. 7 cannot account for the high adsorption of NO over the catalyst with the highest phosphorus content and for its high activity, observed despite the rather poor dispersion and the presence of X-ray detectable phases of NiO and NiWO4. We suspected that the high adsorption of NO on this sample could be due to possible adsorption on the relatively large amount of the NiWO4 phase. However, the IR spectra of NO adsorbed over wafers of the pure support and over a mixture of the support and NiWO4, specially prepared and sulfided under the same conditions as the catalysts, indicate no peaks of NO adsorption in the 1950-1650 cm-1 range. In order to further analyze the possible effect of the NiWO4 phase in the presence and absence of NiO, additional catalytic activity measurements were carried out over samples containing only NiO or NiWO4 and a mechanical mixture of the two compounds. The samples were presulfided and the reactions carried out at exactly the same conditions used in the catalytic activity measure- ments over the catalysts. No traces of catalytic activity were registered. Besides, the investigations reported in [18,19] indicate that at 673 K, the temperature conventionally used for sulfidation of the hydrotreating catalysts, the phase of NiWO4 is not sulfidable, its sulfidation starts high above this temperature. Therefore, since the observed changes in the catalytic activity cannot be clearly related to the changes in the concentration of the different nickel phases present in the catalysts, the reason for the observed form of the catalytic activity curve of this series of catalysts should be sought in the changes induced by phosphorus on the relative amounts of each tungsten phase and on its structure. Fig. 8 shows the IR spectra of the samples in their oxide form in the 1000-600 cm-1 range. The vibrational analysis of different types of tungsten trioxides, tungsten trioxide hydrates [31] and phospho-tungsten heteropoly compounds [32-35] allows us to assign the bands in the 1000-912 cm-~ range to a stretching vibration of a W=O terminal bond and those at 893-665 cm-1 to the stretching vibrations of W-O-W bridge bonds. The phosphorus contain- ing samples have more pronounced peaks with smaller half-widths at half-maxi- mum, which is obviously related to the formation of well crystallized, X-ray detectable phases of WO3 and NiWO4. The peak positions of the bands are practically identical, but differences in the relative intensities of the bands are observed. Fig. 9 shows the dependence of the ratio between the intensities of the W= O and W-O-W bands vs. the phosphorus content. The curve has a striking resemblance to the catalytic activity curve. The sample with the highest catalytic activity has a local maximum in the relative number of terminal W=O bonds, while for the sample with the lowest catalytic activity a minimum in the relative number of terminal bonds is observed. Most probably, this sample has a high 172 T. Halachev et al. /Applied Catalysis A.\" General 136 (1996) 161-175 o ~o Pdo.6 l.o PW2.5 ~5.9 81p 680 I000 900 800 700 600 cm-I Fig. 8.

Halachev et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 136 (1996) 161-I 75 173 degree of polymerization of the tungsten species with included nickel ions. Such an increased polymerization at similar phosphorus content has also been ob- served in molybdenum based systems [36]. The sample with the highest phosphorus content has the highest relative number of terminal bonds. Most probably, this is caused by the presence of a highly dispersed WO3 phase, which is not X-ray detectable or, according to Raman studies [12], to a surface oxide species bound to the support. Indeed, simple calculations based on the samples' composition and the presence of phases of NiO, NiWO4 and some amounts of NiAI204 [27] indicate that only a part of tungsten participates in the formation of NiWO4 and the rest should be present as a highly dispersed phase. It should be this phase that is responsible for the high catalytic activity of the sample. Of course, one should bear in mind that Fig. 9 shows only a ratio between the IR intensities. Therefore, it is the form of the curve that is informative. The fact that the catalyst with the highest phosphorus content (5.9% PeOs) has the highest intensity ratio value (Fig. 9) does not mean that it would manifest the highest catalytic activity, because a part of tungsten is included in the catalytically inactive NiWO4 phase. It could be speculated from the spectrum of this sample (Fig. 8), that the intensity of its peaks is much lower than that of the sample with the highest catalytic activity and that the number of terminal W=O bonds is less in the former than in the latter. However, in the former sample (5.9% P205) the highly dispersed phase is catalytically rather efficient. It is also clear that, while the trend of the ratio of terminal to bridged bonds can be clearly outlined, an accurate quantitative estimation is not possible by the IR spec- troscopy technique used here. Clearly, from the above results and those pub- lished previously [27], the previous incorporation of phosphorus into the cata- lysts, in conjunction with the particularities of the method of preparation employed, lead to changes in the amounts and distribution of the different possible tungsten and nickel species, some of which are active and some are not. Obviously, for the sample with 0.6% P205 an optimal distribution and structure is realized under the influence of the surface AIPOa-like species formed on the surface with the incorporation of phosphorus to the support. It seems, in our case, that the precursor oxide tungsten species with W=O terminal bonds lead, after sulfidation, to the type of unsaturated sites where the hydrogenation reaction takes place. This idea is also developed ([28,29] and Refs. therein). However, the question that still remains to be answered is why such an increased number of terminal W=O bonds is observed at low and high phosphorus content. Finally, we would like to point out that the catalytic activity of this series of catalysts with a tungsten surface concentration of 1.6 W atoms/nm2 is higher than that of some conventional molybdenum based catalysts also modified by phosphorus, where the concentration of Mo atom/nme is twice as high as that of tungsten in the catalysts studied here. One could expect that if the amount of tungsten is increased the catalytic activity would be even higher. 174 T. Halachev et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 136 (1996) 161-175 4. Conclusions (1) The introduction of phosphorus has a promoting effect on the catalytic activity in HYD of naphthalene. The highest activity and selectivity towards decalines is observed for the sample with 0.6% P205. This sample is also characterized by the highest NO chemisorption in its sulfided state and by a local maximum in the relative number of terminal W=O bonds in its oxide state. (2) The coordinatively unsaturated sites related to the terminal W--O bonds in the precursor state are most probably the active sites in HYD in this series of catalysts. (3) The NO adsorption technique cannot always predict correctly the catalytic activity because NO might adsorb on species which are not active in the reaction of interest. (4) The formation of new active sites is possible during the reaction. Acknowledgements T. Halachev and P.

A series of co-impregnated (pH 1) PNiW/Al2O3 catalysts of low tungsten content (1.6 W atoms/nm2) and varying phosphorus concentration (0–5.9 wt.−% P2O5) have been studied in the reaction of hydrogenation of naphthalene in a batch Parr reactor at 573 K and P = 44 atm. In addition to a previous characterization by XRD, DRS and XPS, the catalysts have been characterized here by DRS, FTIR spectroscopy in their oxide state and by FTIR spectroscopy of NO chemisorbed on the sulphided catalysts. A promoting effect of phosphorus is observed in all phosphorus containing samples. The catalytic activity vs. phosphorus content curve has a complex behavior passing through a maximum and a minimum. Phase transitions are observed in the samples with the change of the phosphorus content. The form of the catalytic activity curve is discussed in the light of these phase transitions and the structure and properties of the different phases. The highest catalytic activity is observed for the sample with 0.6% P2O5. This sample is also characterized by the highest amount of chemisorbed NO and by a local maximum in the relative number of terminal WO bonds. When strong overlapping of the bands is observed, the NO adsorption technique should be applied with care. Also, NO might adsorb on sites which are not active in the corresponding hydrotreatment reaction and the trend predicted by the total amount of chemisorbed NO should not necessarily coincide with the form of the catalytic activity curve. The catalytic activity curves indicate that during the reaction changes in the number of active sites or the formation of new active sites are possible.
