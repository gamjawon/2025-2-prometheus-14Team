Introduction Despite extensive studies on heterogeneous acid catalysts, the application of base catalysts receives much less attention. However, interest has increased during the past two decades. Base catalysts catalyze a wide variety of reactions, viz. isomerization, dehydration, dehydrogenation, amination, alkylation, hydro- genation and aldol condensation [1]. Methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) is used as an excellent solvent for the paint industry and an important reagent in dewaxing mineral oils. It is traditionally manufactured via three-step reactions: base-cata- lyzed aldol condensation of acetone in the liquid phase to diacetone alcohol (DAA); acid catalyzed dehydration of DAA to mesityl oxide (MSO); and metal * Corresponding author.

Ko / Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) L259-L265 catalyzed hydrogenation of MSO to MIBK [2]. Recently, one-step processes operating at 100-160 and 10-100 atm have been developed employing bifunctional catalysts such as palladium or platinum metal supported on metal oxides (KOH/A1203, MgO/SiO2 and Nb205) [3,4], ZrO(OH)2/C [5], acidic cation exchange resins [3,6] and zirconium phosphate [2]. Although very high selectivity to MIBK ( > 90%) with acetone conversion ( ~ 40%) was attained, the high pressure system and its complicated operation are a disadvantage. Hence, it is of great importance to develop a process for low-pressure one-step synthesis of MIBK. A ZSM-5 zeolite containing palladium and an alkali metal (Pd/KHZSM-5) was reported to convert acetone at 250 and 1 atm to MIBK with 67.8% selectivity and 45.3% acetone conversion [7]. For the reaction over Pd/ZSM-5 catalyst treated with organic acid, the MIBK selectivity and catalyst life were enhanced due to an expansion of secondary pores and increased acidity [8]. With palladium supported on silicoaluminophosphate molecular sieve (SAPO-34), 60% MIBK selectivity at 20% acetone conversion was obtained [9]. A new hydrogenated aluminophosphate oxynitride supported nickel catalyst was claimed to be effective for the low-pressure one-step synthesis of MIBK [10]. In the reaction of acetone and hydrogen over Ni/MgO catalyst at 200 and 1 atm, high MIBK selectivities (70-80%) were reached. However, the MIBK yield decreased rapidly from 18% to 6% during 3 h process time [11]. In this paper, we report the preliminary results on highly selective synthesis of MIBK from acetone and hydrogen at 200 and 1 atm using magnesia supported palladium catalysts. The catalyst basicity is enhanced by sodium vapor deposition on magnesia, resulting in large increase of acetone conversion and MIBK yield. The catalytic activity and product selectivity are correlated to the catalyst basic and metallic sites. Such catalyst exhibits significantly better results in the catalyst stability, activity and MIBK yield than those reported in the literature [7-11 ]. 2. Experimental Magnesia (Strem, 93-1244) was impregnated with a solution of tetraamine palladium (II) chloride monohydrate (98%, Aldrich), dried at 110 for 12 h and then calcined at 600 for 4 h in air to contain 0.5 wt.-% palladium supported on magnesia (Pd/MgO). Sodium modified magnesia (Na/MgO) was prepared from sodium vapor deposition on magnesia by heating sodium metal at 480 for 0.5 h and then at 550 for 2 h under vacuum (10-3 torr) [12]. Then palladium was supported on Na/MgO following similar procedures. Such catalyst was denoted as Pd/Na/MgO. The BET surface area of the catalysts was obtained with a sorption analyzer (Quantachrome Quantasorb). The measured values are 53, 49, 49 and 60 m2/gcat. for MgO, Na/MgO, Pd/MgO and Pd/Na/MgO, respectively. To K.-H. Lin, A.-N. Ko / Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) L259-L265 L261 analyze the amount of sodium in Pd/Na/MgO, the sample was dissolved in 1 M HCL solution and was found to contain 0.47 wt.-% Na by using an atomic absorption spectrometer (Hitachi Z-6100). The basicities of Pd/MgO and Pd/Na/MgO were determined by temperature-programmed desorption of car- bon dioxide with values of 1.27 and 2.50 t.~mol m-2, respectively. The reaction was conducted at 200 and 1 atm in a fixed-bed, integral-flow reactor (1.7 cm I.D. 50 cm). Before the reaction, the catalyst was treated with hydrogen gas (50 ml/min) of high purity (99.99%) at 400 for 10 h, then cooled to the reaction temperature with flowing dry nitrogen gas. Reagent grade acetone and hydrogen with a molar ratio of 1:1 were fed into the reactor at a total flow rate of 0.1 tool h-1 via a microfeeder (Razel A-99) and a gas flow controller (Scott 52-36E), respectively. The reaction products were identified with a GC-MS (Hitachi M-52) and periodically analyzed by a gas chromato- graph (HP 5890 series) equipped with a PONA column (0.2 mm X 50 m) and a flame-ionization detector. 3. Results and discussion The conversion of acetone (XA), the selectivity (Si) and the yield (Y i) of ith product are defined on the basis of converted acetone. mol of acetone in the product XA(mOI--%) = 1-- mol of acetone in the feedI X 100% mol of acetone converted to i th product Si(m - %) = tool of acetone reacted X 100% mol of acetone converted to i th product Y~(mol - %) = X 100% mol of acetone in the feed Under our reaction conditions, viz. 200, 1 atm, acetone/hydrogen molar ratio 1:1 and W/FA 6.0 goat' h/mol acetone, the main products are MIBK and diisobutyl ketone (DIBK) with total selectivities more than 87%. The minor products include 2-propanol (2P), 4-methyl-2-pentanol (4M2P), 4,6-dimethyl-2- heptanone and 2,6,8-trimethyl-4-nonanone. Contrary to this result, a large quantity of 2P was observed in the reaction of acetone and hydrogen over the Ni/MgO catalyst [11]. Fig. 1 shows the catalyst activity as a function of time-on-stream for acetone conversion over Pd/MgO and Pd/Na/MgO. Both catalysts decay slightly during 8 h on stream, indicating the resistance to coke formation on these catalysts. In addition, Pd/Na/MgO shows much higher activity (~ 56% con- version) than Pd/MgO ( ~ 28% conversion). Fig. 2 compares the selectivities of MIBK, DIBK and 2P in 8 h process time. The MIBK selectivities (58%-65%) were quite high on both catalysts. The selectivity to DIBK was higher on L262 K.-H. Lin, A.-N.

Based on the above results, the Pd/Na/MgO catalyst clearly exhibits much better performances on acetone conversion and MIBK yield in spite of its slightly lower selectivity. Consequently, this is a highly recommended catalyst for low-pressure one-step synthesis of MIBK because of its stability and high MIBK selectivity.

The proposed reaction network in the synthesis of MIBK. attained at W/FA 6.0 g.h/mol. Fig. 5 illustrates the possible reaction network [10]. The main path (I) starts from self condensation of acetone on the catalyst basic sites to yield DAA followed by dehydration to MSO. Selective hydrogena- tion of MSO on metallic sites leads to the formation of MIBK. In a similar way, DIBK is produced from MIBK, acetone and hydrogen. The less important paths (II, III) correspond to the direct hydrogenation on the carbonyl functional group of acetone and MIBK to yield the minor products of 2P and 4M2P, respectively. The role of palladium as metallic sites for hydrogenation is verified by the absence of all hydrogenated products over MgO and Na/MgO catalysts. Since the selectivities of MIBK and DIBK are mucher higher than those of 2P and 4M2P, this implys that hydrogenation of C=C bond of a ketone is much faster than the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group. Such selective hydrogenation over palladium catalyst generally applies to unsaturated ketone and aldehydes [ 13,14]. The Pd/Na/MgO catalyst gives acetone conversion and DIBK selectivity both larger than Pd/MgO; these results are attributed to its stronger basic strength and larger base amount as measured from the temperature-programmed desorp- tion of carbon dioxide. The enhancement of solid basicity by sodium vapor deposition has also been described in the literature [1,12]. In summary, the experimental results can be correlated with the catalytic properties of basic and metallic sites. 4. Conclusion In this preliminary work, sodium modified magnesia supported palladium has shown to be a very promising catalyst for low-pressure one-step synthesis of MIBK from acetone and hydrogen. This catalyst exhibits good stability, high activity and MIBK yield. Further experiments are in progress in order to investigate the optimum reaction conditions, the catalyst characterization and the reaction mechanism.
