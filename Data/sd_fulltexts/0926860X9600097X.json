The SiO2-grafted A1C13 catalysts were active at a temperature as low as 0 and were tractable in handling when they were repeatedly used for the catalytic reaction. Although their catalytic activities were gradually lowered by repetition of the catalytic runs, the catalysts were able to repeatedly apply to the catalytic reaction until the turnover number exceeded 110. The liquid-solid heterogeneous reaction was probably limited by diffusion steps of reactants and/or product in porous catalysts. An ultrasonic vibration during the course of catalytic reaction gave an accelerat- ing effect in such a way that the reaction rates were increased up to about one order of magnitude, compared to those in cases without ultrasonic vibration. The cause of the accelerating effect was discussed from the results which were obtained in the experiments by using several catalysts with different sizes in the particle diameter and in the pore diameter.

Introduction It has been well known that benzene (hereafter, abbreviated simply as B) and substituted benzenes are alkylated with olefins by using strong Lewis acid catalysts such as AIC13, TaCIs, and ZrC14 [1]. Such catalysts, however, are not always applicable to the alkylation using cyclohexene (abbreviated as C). This is believed to be based upon the empirical fact that reactivity of C is so high that * Tel.: (+ 81-43) 2903377; fax: (+ 81-43) 2903039. 0926-860X/96/$15.00 Copyright 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

Sato et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 143 (1996) 271-281 undesirable products such as resinous substances are significantly produced, and that consequently the catalytic selectivity leads to unfavorable low values. As a selective catalyst for the liquid-phase alkylation, it can be referred that SiO2- supported TaC15 [2] selectively promotes the alkylation of B with C to produce cyclohexylbenzene (abbreviated as CB), and that heteropoly acid, CSz.5H0.5PW12040, [3] promotes an alkylation of 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene with cyclohexene. Supported A1C13 catalysts are known to be strong acids, and exhibit catalytic activities for skeletal isomerization of alkane [4]. One of the authors previously mentioned the structures of SiO2-grafted A1C13 and its characteristic behaviors as an acidic catalyst for the entitled reaction [5]. It has been also stated that the active aluminum chloride species is dimerized like a structure of A12C16, whereas monomeric A1CI3 species is less active for the reaction. The dimerized A1C13 species are stabilized at temperatures lower than 250. On the other hand, ultrasonic vibration (USV) is known to accelerate a variety of chemical reactions, particularly those relating to liquid-liquid [6] or liquid-solid heterogeneous reactions [7]. In the latter, most of USV applications have been successfully made on reactions catalyzed by metals [8,9] or reactions of solid reagents in a reactant media [10]. The USV irradiation to the heteroge- neous system is considered to affect processes as cleaning and erosion of metal surfaces and improved mass transfer [7-9]. Much less research on the mechanis- tic considerations has been done on nonmetallic catalyst than on metals. In this report, we describe in detail the catalytic activities of SiO2-grafted A1C13 prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method for the alkylation of B with C in a liquid phase, as in the following: (liquid phase) C6H6 + C6HIo ~ C6H5-C6HII (B) (C) grafted A1CI3 (CB) In addition, we would like to note that irradiation of USV during the reaction results in a significant accelerating effect upon reaction rates of the entitled liquid-solid heterogeneous reaction. We will also discuss about the cause of the accelerating effect owing to irradiation of USV in the porous SiO2-grafted A1C13 catalyst. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation Two silica gels mainly used as supports of A1C13 were supplied by Fuji Davison Ltd. (CARIACT-10: specific surface area (SA) 313 m2 g ~, pore volume (PV) 1.01 cm3 g-1, average pore diameter (Dpore) 13 nm; B-type gel: SA 460 m2 g-1, PV 0.80 cm3 g-1, Dpore, 7.0 nm). The silica supports were S. Sato et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 143 (1996) 271-281 273 crushed and sieved to collect six fractions in particle size: below 60 mesh fraction (average particle diameter: DP = 0.16 mm), 45-60 mesh (DP = 0.6 mm), 24-45 mesh (DP = 0.8 mm), 16-24 mesh (DP = 1.1 mm), 10-16 mesh (DP = 1.9 ram) and over 10 mesh (DP = 2.8 mm). A similar procedure as described in the previous paper [5] was applied to the catalyst preparation. The SiO2-grafted AIC13 catalyst was prepared by the following CVD procedure. The silica support (0.2-0.5 g) was placed on a bed fixed with glass-wool. After the silica had been preheated at 150 for 1 h in a stream of nitrogen, A1C13 vapor was brought into contact with the silica support at 150 for 1 h in a stream of nitrogen (flow rate: 100 cm3 min- 1). In order to compare the activity of SiO2-grafted A1C13 catalyst with those of A1C13 catalysts supported on other materials such as A1203 supplied by Dia Catalyst and Chemicals Ltd. (DC-2282; SA, 195 m2 g-l), SIO2_A1203 by Nikki Chemical Co. (N631-L; SA, 440 m2 g 1) and acidic ion-exchange resin by Rohm and Haas (Amberlyst-15), several catalysts were also prepared by the similar CVD method as SiO2-grafted A1C13 catalyst. Unless otherwise stated, the conditions of catalyst preparation and the way of application to catalytic reaction were the same as those of SiO2-grafted A1C13 catalyst. In addition, for the purpose of evaluation of the effect of catalyst pore diameter upon the reaction, three other kinds of silica with different pore diameters were used as catalyst supports. The silicas were also supplied by Fuji Davison Ltd. (ID gel: Dpore, 22 nm; SA, 253 m2 g-l; PV, 1.4 cm3 g ~; ID Q270: Dpore, 27 nm; SA, 117 m2 g 1; PV, 0.80 cm3 g-l; ID Q450: Dpore, 45 nm; SA, 84 mz g- 1 ; PV, 0.94 cm3 g- 1). These three kinds of silicas were made of uniform particle size in mesh 24-45 (DP = 0.8 mm). The procedure of A1C13 loading onto the silica supports was similar to that described in the cases of CARIACT-10 and B-type gel. 2.2. Catalytic test Catalytic tests were carried out by the usual procedure for batch method in a liquid-solid heterogeneous reaction. In a typical experiment, the reactant mix- ture of B (20 cm3, 230 mmol) and C (1 cm3, 10 mmol) was placed in a 50 cm3 lidded glass vessel and fully immersed in water-bath of the common USV laboratory cleaner (Shibata Kagaku Kikai Kogyo, Model SU-2T, 40 kHz, 60 W/ll0 120 mm). The temperature of water bath was maintained at 0 by occasional adding of crushed ice into the water bath. The reaction-vessel in the bath was positioned at the location of a distance of approximately 5 mm from the bottom where USV was generated. After the reactant mixture had been cooled to 0, 0.2-0.5 g of SiO2-grafted A1C13 catalyst was admitted into the reactant mixture to initiate the reaction. Reaction products were periodically analyzed by gas chromatography using Shimadzu GC-8A unit with 1 m PEG-HT column. Progress of the catalytic 274 S. Sato et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 143 (1996)271 281 reaction was followed by the conversion ( Xc) of C as a function of reaction time (t). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Catalytic ActiL, ities of SiO:-grafted AICI A SiO2-grafted A1CI3 catalyst promoted selectively the alkylation to produce CB under the reaction conditions of a temperature of 0 and of high B/C mol ratios in the range from 10 to 30. In order to determine a suitable support of A1CI> activities of several catalysts were tested under identical reaction condi- tions (Table 1). In each case listed in Table 1, a resinous substance was scarcely produced and the selectivity to CB was close to 100% without forming other by-products, except for dicyclohexylbenzene. It can be seen from Table 1 that SiO2 (CARIACT-10) is most suitable as a support of A1C13 among the routine materials tested. Thus, in the subsequent experiments, we decided to employ the SiO2 as a catalyst support. A difference in activity among the catalysts listed in Table 1 appears to be attributable to the difference in loading of A1CI> which is caused by the varieties of physico- chemical properties such as total surface area or concentration of surface OH-groups in the material used as a support. A commercial reagent A1C13 without any treatment was generally less active for the alkylation of B with C because the reagent surface was partly hydrol- ysed. Although a freshly sublimed AIC13 ('free' A1C13) was active for the reaction, the 'free' A1C13 was dissolved in the reaction mixture, and was very sensitive to moisture. The use of SiO2-grafted A1C13 catalyst was found to have advantage over the 'free' A1C13.

S. Sato et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 143 (1996) 271-281 275 A1C13 catalyst is tightly bound to SiO2 substrate [5] and does not freely move through the system, whereas 'free' A1C13 is partially dissolved into the reactant mixture and contaminates the reaction product. Moreover, the SiO2-grafted A1C13 catalyst was convenient to be repeatedly used for the catalytic reaction from the standpoint of the ready recovery and the easy handling. The typical mode of activity decay was roughly depicted in Fig. 1. For the SiO2-grafted A1C13 catalysts, the catalytic activities were gradually lowered by repetition of the catalytic runs. It can be seen from Fig. 1 that the reaction rate decreases greatly with the repeated number of runs. The decay of catalytic activity would be ascribed to the contamination of active sites by moisture and/or resinous product during the repetition of runs. Until the sixth time of repetition had been finished, a numerical value of turnover number, TON (tool of CB produced based on mol of A1 included in the catalyst used), was found to reach a value over 110. Although the TON value of 110 seems to be low in heterogeneous catalysis, other typical solid acids such as silica-alumina, HY zeolite, heteropoly acids (H3PW12040 and CSz.5Ho.sPWI2040), and protonated ion-exchange resin (Am- berlyst-15), which contained no A1C13, were inactive. The TON value was varied with reaction conditions: TON value was at most 30 under the conditions at B/C ratio of 11 [5]. In any way, the SiO2-grafted A1C13 was active and selective in the entitled reaction. 1.0 L_ ~o.8 ;, = ) \"-0.6 6 o ,_0.4 o c- o *~'-*'0\"I 7 c ~0 0 2 4. 6 8 10 12 14. 16 18 20 Reec'tion 'time, \"t / h Fig. 1.

Effect of USV on the catal3,tic reaction and test of conc, ersion data for integral form of first order kinetics Fig. 2 illustrates an example of the effects of USV upon the catalytic reaction. Fig. 2 clearly shows that irradiation of USV during the course of reaction results in a significant increase in the reaction rate up to the level of several times. The accelerating effect of USV on the catalytic reaction was observed only when A1C13 coexists as a component of the catalyst: SiO2 alone was unable to allow the CB formation, even when USV was irradiated for long time under the analogous reaction conditions. In addition, Fig. 2 shows an another important fact that the accelerating effect of USV is not observed unless USV is irradiated. When the irradiation of USV is discontinued, the reaction rate returns immedi- ately to the corresponding value to the case in which USV is not irradiated (curves (2) and (3) in Fig. 2). Thus, the effect of USV was found to be limited to only during the period of its irradiation, so as to have completely no post-in- fluence. Relationships between conversion (Xc) and reaction time (t) were tested by the following equation which had been derived from the conventional integrat- ing procedure for the first order kinetics in terms of cyclohexene in a slurry-type reactor. 1 W In -- - kt 1 - X, V where k is the rate constant (cm3 g-cat-1 rain-1), V is the reactant volume (cm3) and W is the catalyst weight (g-cat). Fig. 3 shows plots of In 1/(1 - Xc) vs. t for the conversion data which have been shown by curve (1) and (4) in Fig. 2. In Fig. 3, two straight lines passing through the origin and having different slopes were demonstrated. Thus, it has been proved that the above described equation is well suited for evaluations of the rate constants and one may quantitatively compare the activities of various catalysts with the rate constant k. By using the integral rate equation and the evaluated values of slopes of two straight lines shown in Fig. 3, the rate constants kusv and knon were found to be 5.25 and 0.66 cm3 g-cat-~ rain-l, where kusv and kno~ are the rate constants with and without USV irradiation, respectively. A ratio of kvsv/knon is about 8 for the narrow-pore silica CARIACT-10, and it can be said as a qualitative expression that the irradiation of USV increases the reaction rate up to about one order of magnitude. 3.3. Effect of catalyst particle size upon the reaction rates A separate series of experiments was performed by using six kinds of SiO2-grafted A1C13 catalysts which were chosen of differing particle sizes from S.

By using the integral equation of first order kinetics previously described, the conversion data were analyzed to determine the numerical values of k in the six kinds of catalysts. The values of k were illustrated in Fig. 4 on log-log scales, as a function of DP. It has been seen in Fig. 4 that the rate constant k varies extensively with DP, regardless of the irradiation of USV. Although the variation in k appears to be complicated, k -- k' DP- for line 2 at a full range of DP in Fig. 4, and k = k' DP-].2 for line 1 at DP ranges higher than 0.5 mm, where k' is the proportional constant. It can be summarized in the following way: the numerical values of k decreased inversely with the increase in DP in such a way that the equation k = k' DP-1 can be approximately derived. This expression between k and DP is allowed to speculate the case in which diffusion steps of reactants and/or product act as a rate-determining step in the heterogeneous catalytic reaction consisting of a series of various steps such as external mass transport and internal mass transport process in porous materials. Taking this matter into consideration, some of the discussion on the accelerating effect of USV upon the catalytic reaction will be described in the following section. 3.4. Discussion on the accelerating effect of USV upon the catalytic reaction In many liquid-solid heterogeneous reactions catalyzed by metals, the accel- erating effect of USV is known to be attributed to a creation of highly active metal surface by a localized erosion or collisions between the suspending solid S. Sato et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 143 (1996) 271-281 279 particles [9]. In this work, however, the accelerating effect of USV is considered to be ascribed to the other cause. This consideration is based on the following experimental facts: the irradiation of USV scarcely gives a development of new fine particles of catalyst even after the catalytic runs had continued for a long reaction time (3 h), and the effect was limited to the period of addition in such a way that it immediately disappeared when USV was discontinued, as shown in Fig. 2. Although the intrinsic role of USV for enhancement of the reaction rates has not defined yet, we have tentatively speculated that the irradiation of USV decreases the resistance of mass transfer through the porous catalyst particles: it enhances the intra-diffusivities of reactants and/or product in the porous catalyst particles. This speculation was also supported by the experiment in which several silica supports with different pore diameters were used, as described in the next section. 3.5. Effect of catalyst pore size upon the reaction rate Five kinds of silica with different pore diameters, which varies from 7.0 to 45 nm, are used as catalyst supports. Although the A1C13 loading was almost independent of particle size (DP) of the silica supports of B-type gel and CARIACT-10, an A1C13 loading was linearly proportional to specific surface area (SA) of supports: the A1C13 loadings were 0.25, 0.16, 0.15, 0.07, and 0.04 g-A1C1x g-SiO2~ for the silica supports of B-type gel (SA=450 m2 g-~), 60 5O \"7 e-- \" 40 \"7 C3 -- 30 I \" 20 10 [q (2) 0 i i 0 10 20 30 4.0 50 Pore dinae~er, Dpore / nn Fig. 5.

CARIACT-10 (313 m2 g l), ID gel (253 m2 g ~), ID Q270 (117 m2 g 1), and ID Q450 (84 m2 g-l), respectively. Fig. 5 shows a relation between average pore diameter (Dpore) of the supports and reaction rate constants, kusv and knon, based on the A1C13 loading. If an external transport process limits the reaction rate, the reaction rate constant should be independent of Dpore. In the case of without USV irradiation, however, the rate constant of knon was saturated with increase in Dpore (curve 2 in Fig. 5). The saturation in knon indicates that diffusion of reactants and/or product is not restricted in the catalyst pores larger than 22 nm. In other words, this reaction is limited by diffusion of substrates in the pores smaller than 22 nm. This finding is consistent with the above-mentioned speculation that the rate-determining step in the liquid-solid heterogeneous reaction is the diffusion step of reactants and/or product. In contrast to the rate constant of k ..... the rate constant of kusv was maximized at a Dpore of 13 nm (curve 1 in Fig. 5). In order to clarify the effect of USV irradiation on the acceleration of reaction rate, a ratio of kusv to knon is summarized in Fig. 6. The ratio of kusv to kno. was found to increase with decrease in Dpore. The smaller the pore size of catalyst, the more effective is the acceleration of the reaction rate with USV irradiation. Because USV irradiation probably increases the transport rate of the reactant molecules as a result of weakening of resistance of mass transfer, the number of collisions between the reactants and the catalytically active sites in narrow pores of the catalyst is larger than that in wide pores. The maximum in kusv of the curve 2 S. Sato et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 143 (1996) 271-281 281 in Fig. 5 is explained as follows: although the accelerating effect owing to irradiation of USV is much more efficient in smaller pores, the transport of reactants and/or product itself is greatly limited in the narrowest-pore (7 rim) catalyst. 4. Conclusion Liquid-phase alkylation of benzene with cyclohexene to produce cyclohexyl- benzene was selectively catalyzed by using SiO2-grafted A1C13 prepared by CVD. The SiO2-grafted A1C13 catalyst was highly active at a reaction tempera- ture of 0 and was able to repeatedly apply to the reaction until the value of TON exceeded 110. Several experimental results indicate that the rate-determin- ing step in the liquid-solid heterogeneous reaction was probably the diffusion step of the reactants and/or product in the pore of catalyst. In addition, applying of USV to the reaction gave a significant accelerating effect on the reaction rates. The cause of the accelerating effect of ultrasonic vibration was improve- ment of mass transfer of reactants and/or product. References [1] G.A.

Liquid-phase alkylation of benzene with cyclohexene to cyclohexylbenzene was investigated using SiO2-grafted AlCl3 catalysts prepared by the chemical vapor deposition method. The SiO2-grafted AlCl3 catalysts were active at a temperature as low as 0°C and were tractable in handling when they were repeatedly used for the catalytic reaction. Although their catalytic activities were gradually lowered by repetition of the catalytic runs, the catalysts were able to repeatedly apply to the catalytic reaction until the turnover number exceeded 110. The liquid-solid heterogeneous reaction was probably limited by diffusion steps of reactants and/or product in porous catalysts. An ultrasonic vibration during the course of catalytic reaction gave an accelerating effect in such a way that the reaction rates were increased up to about one order of magnitude, compared to those in cases without ultrasonic vibration. The cause of the accelerating effect was discussed from the results which were obtained in the experiments by using several catalysts with different sizes in the particle diameter and in the pore diameter.
