HAMILTON, KENNETH J. IVIN and JOHN J. ROONEY Department of Chemistry, The Queen's University of Belfast, BT9 SAG (U.K.) Summary A 51:49 mixture of syn- and ant(-7-methylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene was subjected to a number of Ru-, Os-, Ir-, W- and Re-based catalysts, and the structures of the polymers and their hydrogenated analogues determined by \"C NMR spectroscopy. Except in one case, the polymer consisted exclusively of ring-opened units of the anti isomer; the syn isomer could be recovered in good yield. This confirms that the exo face of norbornenes is normally highly reactive whereas the endo face is relatively inert towards metathesis. The exception was the highly reactive (mesitylene)W(CO)3/ EtAlCl^/epoxide catalyst, where a small proportion of syn units was found in the soluble part of the polymer. The same catalyst also polymerises the syn isomer in the presence of a small amount of anti isomer and effects its copolymerisation with norbornene. It will also polymerise bicycio [2.2.2]- oct-2-ene by ring-opening, but not l,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene. The ring dyad tacticity with respect to both cis and trans junctions could be determined directly from the spectra of the ring-opened polymers of the anti isomer, and the overall tacticity from the spectra of the corre- sponding hydrogenated polymers. The fractions of m and r dyads for trans and cis junctions respectively are generally in the range 0.5 -1.0, but are not always equal, with noble metal catalysts having a tendency (which is espe- cially marked in the case of initiation by the Ru-TFA complex) for trans junctions to be atactic and cis junctions syndic tactic. The cis/trans double bond distribution is often blocky. These results confirm that, in general, two types of metal-carbene com- plex are important propagating species; one in which the last formed unit (cis) is still coordinated, thereby sterically biasing the next monomer inser- tion in favour of another cis unit, while in the second the last formed unit (trans) has detached from the metal ion before the metal carbene reacts with monomer, which it then does with a strong bias towards the formation of a trans junction. Various possible chiral and achiral forms of these two species together with appropriate relaxation processes are briefly discussed. 0304-5102/85/$3.30 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 256 Introduction The ring-opening polymerisation of norbomene (1) can be induced by a wide range of metathesis catalysts based on transition metal compounds [1]. metathesis catalyst I- ^ v \\_J 1 2 Catalysts are available to give polymers 2 with a complete range of cis/trans double-bond content. Ring-opening occurs at the double bond itself, so that the cyclopentane rings in the polymer are always c('s-l,3 enchained. The rings, however, may have two possible configurations and, as represented in 2, successive rings may have either an m dyad (isotactic) relationship or an r dyad (syndic tactic) relationship. It is now well established that these polymerisations are propagated by metal-carbene complexes [I], normally generated in situ from the catalyst/ monomer mixture, or sometimes employed as such [2]. An important ques- tion concerns the stereochemistry of the propagating species, and in partic- ular whether it is chiral with respect to the metal centre. An answer to this question can be obtained from the ring dyad tacticity. If it is assumed that this is governed only by the chirality with respect to the metal centre and that this chirality is preserved between propagation steps, then it may be predicted that cfe double bonds will be associated with r dyads, and trails double bonds with TO dyads [3]. If the metal centre is achiral, or is chiral but rapidly epimerising, then the polymer should be atactic, unless chirality within the polymer chain itself can influence the tacticity. Unfortunately, the \"C NMR spectrum of polymer 2 shows no resonances that are sensitive to this m/r structural effect [3]. We have there- fore had to resort in the past to the use of optically-resolved 5-substituted norbornenes, thereby permitting the m/r effect to be transformed into a head-tail or head-head, tail-tail effect which can be readily detected by \"C NMR spectroscopy. In this way we have shown, for example, that Reds gives an all-cis syndiotactic polymer while RuCIs gives an all-trans, nearly atactic polymer [4, 5]. This method has allowed us to divide catalyst sys- tems into four types, according to the observed tacticities with respect to cis and trans double bonds in the polymer [6]. This method of using optically-active 5-substituted norbornenes to determine tacticity suffers from three drawbacks: (i) the optical resolution of the monomer precursor is time-consuming and necessarily of low yield; (ii) the results must be corrected for the presence of the minor enantiomer when the monomer is not 100% optically pure; (iii) the interpretation be- 257 comes more complicated if there is any tendency towards head-tail bias in the polymers made from the racemic monomer. Quantitative measurements of tacticity in systems of this type would be made much easier and more precise if a monomer could be found whose polymers gave \"C NMR spectra with resonances directly sensitive to m/r dyads. We have found that ant;-7-methylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene (3) is one such monomer and the results with some key catalysts are reported here. The spectra of the hydrogenated analogues 5 also provide valuable informa- tion concerning tacticity. 5,__6 metathesis ,-3 J\\^-i H catalyst '/ \\ r3 4/ u2 1 )^<T^CH^ 4 5 Results Cis-content and cis/trans blockiness in polymers 4 The cis contents of polymers made with eight catalysts are listed in Table 1, in order of increasing Oc values. The 'best' values of Oc are con' sidered reliable to 0.01. In the four cases where it was possible to derive values of r^ and r< the cis/trans distributions were somewhat blocky (r^r^ > 1), as expected from previous work with norbornene [6, 7]. The \"C NMR spectra on which these values are based are presented below in order of increasing complexity. The assignments rest on the knowledge [4, 5, 8] that the fourth and eighth catalysts in Table 1 normally give highly tactic polymers, in the sense that cis double bonds are associated with r dyads, and trans double bonds with m dyads. With all but the fourth catalyst, only the anti isomer was polymerised from a 51:49 mixture of syn and anti isomers. If the polymerisation of the anti isomer was allowed to go to completion, the syn isomer could be re- covered in good yield from the reaction mixture. Later we describe exper- iments involving the polymerisation of the syn isomer itself. Reds-initiated polymer The \"C NMR spectrum of this polymer is shown in Fig. 1. It consists of five main lines, all very sharp, as expected for a syndiotactic polymer. The line positions and assignments are listed in Table 2. Some minor peaks are due to the presence of about 10% trans double bonds. The position of the trans C114 line at 51.56 ppm corresponds in position to that of an m dyad, as identified later. 258 TABLE 1 cis Contents a and blockiness1' in ring-opened polymers\" of 3 Catalyst systemRuCla-SHaO OsCIa\" (60 \"0 (60 C) [1 (r0 0 ^]nol dm9 9 a, ^ C0 0 1,30015 L-CT(Cl,4000 0 13 C5'60 00 0 13 'best'000 0 13 'CC7 ' ( C7 IrCls-SHzO (90 C) 1 1 0 25 0 22 026 0 24 (mesitylene)W(CO)3/ (20 C) 0 4 0 51 043 046 045 23s 26 EtAlCli/EPOdO 1 1) WCl6/Bu4Sn (1 2) (20 C) 0 7 0 52 0 53 0 51 052 1 8 1 6 WC4/Me4Sn (14) I*' (20 C) 1 3 0 52 0 53 0 55 0 54 lit (20 C) 0 55 0 56 0 56 056 1 9 1 3 lie 0 54 0 57 0 56 0 56 1 9 1 3 Ru-TFA complex h (70 C) 0 9 0 55 0 55 0 57 0 56 3 2 2 1 Reds\" (20 C) 1 6 -09' ^Oc = fraction of double bonds that are c;s, calculated from the carbon resonances indicated ^r^ = cc/ct, Tt = tt/cc where cc, ct, ft denote the proportions of the various double-bond pairs c Prepared in the presence of an equal proportion of syn isomer which is only polymerised to a slight extent in one case (fourth catalyst) [M] = concentration of anti isomer in mol dm\"3 [7?] = 190 and 13 cm3 g\"3 for OsCIa and Reds initiated polymers, respectively (25 C, CHCIa) ''Epoxide of norbornene ''C5'6 gives rc= 1 5,r( = 25 f I and II are different preparations BFrom the spectrum obtained with gated pulsing (to remove NOE) \"TFA = CFaCOO 1 Estimated (trans peaks not printed out) -.23 -14 -56 r 56 [s^r'XLZ hCH-<z/*-C CH+ CH 8 -.14 136 132 50 40 30 20 ppm Fig I \"C NMR spectrum of polymer initiated by Reds, Oc~ 0 9 For line positions, see Table 2 259 TABLE 2 Line positions and assignments for the l3C NMR spectrum of a high-cis syndiotactic polymer of 3 (see Fig 1) Position Assignment Substitution parameters (ppm)'1 (ppm j13 134 25 rcC2'3 7+8 0 2C 48 38 rcC7 a 5.5 46 69 re C1.4 (j3+e)+e 7.85 31.98 re C5'6 (7+5) -1.3 16 29 rcC8 a In order to ensure internal consistency with irons polymers, these line positions were those recorded from a spectrum of a mixture of high-cis and aU-trans polymers. b Chemical shift in polymer 4 less the corresponding chemical shift in polymer 2 [9] (7+5) denotes that the substituent is both 7 and 5 with respect to C5'6, likewise for (^e) \"This value is positive rather than negative because C8 is trans with respect to C2 and C3, making 7 very small.

One assumption is required in making the assignments of the C1'4 peaks, namely that the line order for the secondary splitting is the same for the 51.76, 51.70 pair as for the 51.53, 51.47 pair (5^ r = 0.06 ppm). This is the same magnitude and direction as for the m/r splittings of C8, where the effect is transmitted through the same number of bonds. The primary splitting for C1'4 (5,. 6n, = 0.23 ppm) is very similar to that observed in HH trans dyads for polymers of 5,5-dimethylbicyclo [2.2.1 ]hept-2-ene (0.26 ppm) [5]. (Mesitylene)W(CO)3/EtAlCl^/EPO-initiated polymer This polymer (Op = 0.45) was separated into two fractions, one soluble (27%), and the other insoluble (73%) but swollen in chloroform.

It will be seen later that these are due to units of the syn isomer. The spectrum of the insoluble fraction is shown in Fig. 3, and the line positions and assignments listed in Table 4. Some of the lines (bracketed) are common to those in Tables 2 and 3, where they have been used as the basis of the assignments. The others arise from the presence of ct pairs. The line 262 order for C7, namely cc, ct, tt, is the same as in the polymer of 1 but the magnitude of the splitting is only 0.4 ppm, instead of 0.7 ppm [3]. The line order for C5'6, namely cc, ct, tc, tt, is also the same as for the polymer of 1 but again the splittings are somewhat smaller. The C''4 resonances do not show any secondary splittings, unlike the polymer of 1, but the primary splitting (51.54 46.67 = 4.87 ppm) is of comparable magnitude. The ratios / c and f( (see Table 1) may be derived from both the C7 and C5'6 signals; TC Tt is greater than unity indicating a certain degree of cis/trans blockiness. It is especially to be noted that only one line is observed for C8 in a tactic polymer containing comparable proportions of cis and trans double bonds, in contrast to the two well-resolved peaks (16.29,16.15 ppm, respec- tively) seen in the spectrum of a mixture of high-cfs and ailerons polymers. The reason for this must be that the chemical shift of C8 carbons within a cc dyad is sensitive to the configuration of the next-nearest double bonds (cccc, 16.29 ppm; ccct, tcct, 16.18 ppm). WCl^/Bu^Sn-initiated polymer The spectrum of this polymer {Oc = 0.52), shown in Fig. 4, contains considerably more fine structure than that of a tactic polymer of similar c;s content (Fig. 3). This indicates that the ring dyads are atactic with respect to both cis and trans double bonds, as discussed in detail below. The line positions and assignments are listed in Table 5. The main problem is to distinguish m(r splittings from cc/ct or tt/tc splittings. In this we are helped by a knowledge of the assignments derived from Figs, 1, 2 and 3 (peak positions shown in brackets in Table 5); the remaining lines may then be assigned with a fair degree of certainty. c' n-n c t 2,3 136 134 54 52 50 48 46 34 32 30 18 16 ppm Fig. 4. \"C NMR spectrum of polymer initiated by WCle/Bi^Sn system; Oc 1= 0.52.

Bracketed values correspond to those in Tables 2, 3 or 4 as appropriate. ''The first letter in the tacticity assignment (m or r) corresponds to the first letter in the double-bond assignment (c or t). Where no letter (m or r) is given, the line position is in- sensitive to tacticity-in this spectrum. In the olefinic region (C2-3) the positions of the t m, t r and c r lines are already known from Figs. 1 and 2. The additional line at 134.53 ppm is therefore assigned to c m. The fine structure of the c r and t m signals, seen as shoulders or discrete peaks in Fig. 3, is now obscured, since the various pos- sible double-bond triads can be associated with other tacticity triads, e.g. ccc with mrr and mrm as well as rrr. Only two lines are observed in the C1'4 trans region. The triad tacticity, previously seen in Fig. 2, is no longer resolved, probably because the secondary m/r splitting (0.06 ppm) is now masked by a very small un- resolved tt/tc splitting. The primary splitting (0.18 ppm) is sufficiently large to give well-resolved peaks from which a reliable value of the tacticity with respect to trans junctions can be obtained. In contrast, the C1'4 ct's resonance at 46.71 ppm shows no m/r splitting. The C7 region shows three additional lines compared with Fig. 3, at 49.03, 48.72 and 48.32 ppm. We already know that there is no m/r splitting for the tt signal (47.56 ppm; cf. Fig. 2). It is therefore reasonable to assume that for a ct structure any splitting will be due only to m or r tacticity with respect to the cis double bond, giving two lines, while for cc there will be three possibilities, namely mm, mr (= rm) and rr. Hence six lines may be expected altogether, as indeed is observed in this particular spectrum. The 264 position of ccrr is already known from Table 2, as well as ctr from Table 4. The other three ci's lines may then be assigned as shown in Table 5, on the basis of a constant difference, , ,. = 0.29 0.02 ppm, for both cc and ct. In other spectra of atactic polymers the two central C7 lines (48.45, 48.32 ppm) were not resolved, which unfortunately reduces the precision of c;'s tacticities derived from the C7 peaks. The C5'6 resonance consists of eight peaks in two groups of four: a c;s group (31.91 - 32.29 ppm) and a more closely spaced trans group (31.41 - 31.66 ppm). This compares with a total of four C5'6 peaks in the spectrum of the cis/trans tactic polymer (Fig. 3), from which it may be concluded that there is an m/r splitting to give the eight C5'6 peaks in Fig. 4. The assign- ments in Table 5 fit a consistent pattern, with , ,. equal to 0.27 0.01 ppm for cc and ct, and 0.07 0.02 ppm for tc and tt. Since the peaks are rather close together the computer print-out will not give very reliable values of the tacticity, especially for trans junctions. The C8 fine structure may be interpreted in a manner similar to that for C7. We already know from Fig. 3 that ttmm, ctrm (s tcmr), and ccrr must be coincident or nearly so. In an all-trans polymer the m/r splitting is 0.06 ppm (Table 3) but this may well be obscured when cttc and cttt sequences are present. The main cause of the fine structure of the C8 resonance in Fig. 4 must therefore be an m/r splitting associated with the cis double bonds (8m ~ 5r = 0.28 0.02 ppm), giving the assignments shown in Table 5. It is difficult to obtain a reliable value for the tacticity of the cis junctions from the C8 peaks because of the proximity of tt mm, tc mr and cc rr peaks. WCl(,/Me^Sn-initiated polymer This polymer had a similar cis content (Oc = 0.55) to that of the WCl^/ Bu4Sn-initiated polymer (Oc = 0.52), but the C7 ct m and cc rr peaks were not resolved. In order to arrive at a value for the cis tacticity it is necessary to estimate the contribution of each structure to the merged peak, which can be done approximately knowing the value of Oc from the C1'4 or C5'6 peaks. An interesting feature of the spectrum of this polymer was the occur- rence of very small peaks at 142.99, 113.51 and 52.46 ppm (about 2% of the height of the main peaks) which clearly derive from carbons a, b and c respectively in the vinyl end-group structures 7. No other types of end group were apparent. One end group of this type is to be expected from the known mechanism of initiation via [W]=CH2 using this catalyst [10]. The fact that both end groups appear to be the same suggests that [W]=CHPn undergoes either (i) reaction with itself to give P^CH=CHP^, or (ii) reaction with [W]=CH2 to give CH^=CHP^, or (iii) a 265 transfer reaction with ethylene produced as a by-product of the catalyst sys- tem. Polymer initiated by the Ru-TFA complex The spectrum of this polymer, Fig, 5, gives CT(. = 0.57, i.e. a similar cis content to the previous three polymers. However, the fine structure is notably different from that for both the fully tactic (Fig. 3) and atactic polymers (Fig. 4). The C1'4 trans peaks show clearly that the trans junctions are essentially atactic, but the absence of additional C7 and C8 peaks, com- pared with Fig. 3, indicates that the cis junctions are highly syndiotactic. Furthermore, the C7 fine structure gives r-c = 3.2, F( = 2.1. Thus a typical sequence of double bonds in this polymer would be four cis followed by three trans. 136 134 132 52 50 48 46 34 32 30 18 16 ppm Fig. 5. \"C NMR spectrum of polymer initiated by Ru-TFA complex; Oc = 0.56. For numbering, see Fig. 1. Peak i = impurity. OsC/3- and IrClyinitiated polymers These two polymers, having Oc equal to 0.13 and 0.25 respectively, gave spectra indicating that the trans junctions were atactic or somewhat biased to m dyads. It is more difficult to deduce anything definite about the tacticity of the cis junctions since the two most downfield C7 peaks (49.03, 48.72 ppm) were very small and possibly overlaid by peaks from end groups or impurities. This was particularly liable to be the case for the IrCl3- initiated polymer, where there were small peaks elsewhere in the spectrum (132.48, 53.42, 25.72, 12.38 ppm). In these two cases the cis tacticity is better obtained by subtracting the trans tacticity from the overall tacticity derived from the spectrum of the hydrogenated polymer, as described below. 266 The hydrogenated polymers 5 The spectrum of a typical hydrogenated atactic polymer is shown in Fig. 6. The line positions and assignments are listed in Table 6. The assign- ment of the C2'3 peaks was confirmed by the spectrum of a deuterated polymer where the C2'3 resonance is much reduced. The C1'4, C5'6 and C8 resonances are all sensitive to triad tacticity, while the C2'3 resonance is sensi- tive to dyads. Only C7 is insensitive to tacticity. The fine structure was readily assigned by comparing the spectra of atactic and predominantly syndiotactic polymers. Unlike the unsaturated precursors, the line order in the hydrogenated polymers is the same for all carbon nuclei that are sensitive to tacticity ( , > 5,.). 50 46 46 36 34 32 30 28 20 18 16 ppm Fig. 6. \"C NMR spectrum of a hydrogenated atactic polymer. For line positions, see Table 6. Peak i = impurity. The hydrogenated polymer made from the (mesitylene)W(CO)3/ EtAlClz/EPO-initiated polymer (Oc = 0.45) is an especially interesting case. We have seen that in the original polymer not only are c;'s junctions syndio- tactic and trans junctions isotactic, but the cis/trans double-bond distribu- tion is somewhat blocky. The m/r distribution in the hydrogenated polymer should therefore also be somewhat blocky, as indeed is confirmed by the spectrum shown in Fig. 7. The values of mm/mr and rr/rm derived from the three C8 peaks are 1.9 and 1.85 respectively, in reasonable agreement with the values of r^ and r<; derived from the spectrum of the precursor (Fig. 3 and Table 1).

However in the present case some small discrepancies were noted in the overall tacticities derived from the spectra of 4 and 5 when run under normal pulsing conditions. It therefore became necessary to check the values of Ti and NOE.

If the NOE values from peak areas are to be believed, the NOE values are constant within 2% for a given nucleus, except for C114. How- ever, this abnormality is not reflected in the ratio of peak heights for C1'4. The procedure adopted for polymer 4 was to correct the data on the basis of the NOE values derived from the peak areas. The correction is only slight and is in the direction to eliminate at least part of the aforementioned discrepancies. No corrections were applied in the case of polymers 5, where up to four values of the tacticity parameter could be derived from one spectrum and the mean value taken. The TI values show two interesting features. First, the values for nuclei associated with c;'s double bonds are about half those for nuclei associated with trans double bonds. This is clearly due to the greater ease of segmental motion which is possible for a dyad containing a trans double bond. Secondly, the longest Ti values are those for the methyl carbons, reflecting the relatively rapid rotation that is possible for the methyl group. Quantitative determination of tacticities The fractions of ci's and trans junctions associated with m dyad struc- tures in polymer 4 are defined as (Om)c an(^ (Om)t, respectively. The overall m dyad tacticity a^ is defined by eqn. (1). 0m = Oc(am)c + <Jt(Om)t (1) The value of Op, observed for the hydrogenated polymer provides a cross- check on the value of a^ derived from eqn. (1). The experimental values are collected in Table 8. For the reasons given earlier, the directly determined values of (Om)c for the Osda- and Irda-initiated polymers are not reliable. In these cases (Om)c ha^ been calculated from eqn. (1), putting o^i equal to Om. These two polymers resemble the polymer initiated by the Ru-TFA complex in having predominantly syndiotactic cis junctions and more or less atactic trans junc- tions. ^H NMR spectra of polymers 4 A brief study was made of some of the polymers described in Table 1, but the spectra did not yield much useful information in terms of ci's content or tacticity.

BCH^ 10 In each case a sample of the 51:49 mixture of syn and anti isomers was first polymerised to high conversion of anti isomer using WC4/Me4Sn as the catalyst. In the first experiment, the residual monomer (mainly syn) was pumped off from the reaction mixture, collected and treated with the (mesitylene)W(CO)3/EtAlCl2/EPO catalyst system (in the presence of any residual volatile tin compounds from the first polymerisation). This resulted in the polymer whose spectrum is shown in Fig. 8. This contains small peaks from units of the residual anti monomer, with positions as in Fig. 3, but the main peaks, whose line positions are listed in Table 9, correspond to those seen previously only as weak peaks in the spectrum of the soluble fraction of polymer made from the 51:49 syn/anti mixture. The line intensities in Fig. 8 show that the polymer contains 83% syn units flanked by 80% trans and 20% cis double bonds, and 17% anti units flanked by 60% cis and 40% trans double bonds. A predominance of trans double bonds associated with syn units is also observed in the soluble fraction of the polymer containing mainly anti units. There is no sign of m/r splitting of any peak associated with syn units, so that here too the polymer is likely to be tactic (c r, t m). Since the much more reactive anti isomer polymerises first, followed more slowly by the syn isomer, the product may consist, at least in part, of a block copolymer. In the second experiment, after removal of the anti isomer by pre- polymerisation, the recovered syn isomer (which this time was essentially free of anti isomer) was mixed with the (mesitylene)W(CO)3/EtA!Cl2/EPO catalyst. No reaction appeared to have occurred after 2 d, as judged by the viscosity, and so a small amount of norbornene was then added resulting in 272 -14 23 C as r'l rti C t tctt cc ct C56 s C t 5 6 CH <^C CH-, C c t 134 132 52 50 48 46 44 42 32 30 28 16 14 12 10 ppm Fig. 8. \"C NMR spectrum of polymer made from monomer rich in syn isomer, initiated by (mesitylene)W(CO)3/EtAlCl2/EPO system (cf.

The spectrum of the polymer formed showed that it contained 34% norbornene units flanked by 58% cis, 42% trans double bonds, and 66% syn monomer units flanked by about 85% trans and 15% cis double bonds. Again one cannot be sure whether the product is a true copolymer, a block copolymer or just a mixture of homo- polymers. In another experiment, using four parts syn isomer and one part 273 norbornene (premixed) and the same catalyst, the polymer contained more than 90% norbornene units. In view of the successful polymerisation of the syn isomer, an attempt was made to polymerise l,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene (11), and to copolymerise it with norbornene using the same catalyst system but with- out success. However, bicyclo[2.2.2]oct-2-ene (12) was found to polymerise to 30% conversion using this catalyst system in the presence of a trace of norbornene and tetramethyl tin. The \"C NMR spectrum of the polymer 11 12 accorded with the ring-opened structure 13: C2'3 133.56, 133.35, 132.98; C1'4 tt 38.25, tc 37.82, ct 34.01, cc 33.65; C5-6-7-8 c 29.99, t 27.76. The C1'4 lines gave Oc = 0.25 and indicated a somewhat blocky cis/trans distribu- tion {i-t = 3.2, TC = 0.75). Although 12 has been reported before to polymerise with metathesis catalysts [II], the structure of the polymer has not previously been established. Discussion The fact that with all eight catalyst systems the anti isomer polymerises much more readily than the syn isomer proves, as previously assumed [3], that attack on norbornenes in metathesis systems occurs at the much more reactive exo face [12]. Nevertheless 12, which has two equivalent faces spa- tially similar to the endo faces in the bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-enes, polymerises using the (mesitylene)W(CO)3-based catalyst. Therefore on steric grounds alone we cannot exclude the possibility that the syn isomer polymerises by attack on the endo face; also, in known addition reactions of 7,7-dimethyl- bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, attack occurs on both the exo and endo faces depending on the reagent [13], so the question of the preferred orientation of the syn monomer for metathesis is still unresolved. In any event, the steric effect is manifest in the higher trans character of the polymer formed from the syn monomer. In our previous work with 5,5-dimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene (5,5- DMNBE) as monomer, we were able to divide catalyst systems into four types according to the tacticity of the resulting polymers [6]. The same clas- sification can be used here but with essentially only three types represented, as indicated below: 274 Type I (Or)c - (Om)t ~ 1 Type III (Or)c > (ffm)t Type IV (Or)c ~ (Om)t - 0.5 Reds (mes)W(CO)3/EtAld2* OsCl3 IrCIs Ru-TFA* (RuCL,) RuCIa gives an all-trans polymer and may belong either to Type III or to Type IV. The asterisked catalysts all give polymers with cis content in the middle range (Oc = 0.45 - 0.56) and all with blocky cis/trans distribution. Some of the other catalysts may give blocky distributions as well. Thus regardless of tacticity behaviour, it is generally necessary to postulate at least two kinetically distinct propagating metal-carbene complexes. This means that the propagation rate depends on whether the previously formed double bond was cis or trans. In the case of the former, the more strongly complex- ing cis unit (which possesses a dipole moment) may remain within the coor- dination sphere until the next monomer enters, and, because of steric com- pression, forces the next junction to be again largely c;s. However, when the last formed unit is trans, it is likely to be less strongly complexing (no net dipole moment) and to detach completely from the metal before the next monomer complexes, which it does in a largely trans mode, in order to minimise steric repulsion on the developing metallacyclobutane. Provided that both species are chiral, and do not epimerise or become achiral by some relaxation process between propagation steps, Type I behaviour is accounted for by complexes 14 and 15 and their mirror-image forms, as previously dis- cussed [6] (Pn denotes polymer chain). / Mt D / | 14 15 The mechanism of metathesis that we then envisage is via direct supra- facial [2+2] cycloadditions and cycloreversions involving the Mt=C double bonds in these complexes and the C=C double bonds in monomers and polymer chain respectively [14]. For catalysts giving Type III behaviour with the present monomer, the value of (o,.)c is high (0.8 -1.0) while the value of (On,); is in the region of 0.5 (0.44 - 0.65). The limiting case of (o,.)c =i 1 ^d {Om)t = 0.5 can be readily 275 explained, along with cis/trans blockiness, in terms of propagation by two species. One of these is 14 where the complexed double bond prevents loss of chiral identity or epimerisation, while the other is a racemic mixture of -R and S forms of 15, or is a highly symmetrical achiral isomer formed from 15 by a rapid relaxation process. We are confident that the value of (o,n)t ^ess than 0.5 in the particular case of the Ru-TFA catalyst is significant, and that there is a slight syndio- tactic bias in making trans junctions. One possible explanation is that a somewhat relaxed form of 14 may also propagate formation of a trans junc- tion, but here the monomer enters by suprafacial attack on the [Mt]=C bond on the side anti to the last formed double bond, which is still within the coordination sphere. We may note that with IrCIa, (Om)^ has a value of 0.65 suggesting that epimerisation or relaxation is not complete in this case. Shifts from Type III to Type IV behaviour also seem to be brought about by slight changes in catalyst or in monomer. Thus IrCl3 in the present system behaves differently from IrC^-COD with 5,5-DMNBE (Type IV behaviour), yet Ru-TFA in the present system behaves like RuCl3-COD with 5,5- DMNBE [6]. Finally, we come to the catalysts giving Type IV behaviour. With 5,5- DMNBE as monomer, WCle/Bu4Sn at 20 C gives tactic polymer (Type I, Op = 0.61) whereas at 100 C it gives atactic polymer (Type IV, Oc = 0.71) [6]. With 3 as monomer, the same catalyst at 20 C gives atactic polymer (Type IV, ac = 0.52), i.e. the behaviour resembles that with 5,5-DMNBE at 100 C. Likewise with WCl<,/Me4Sn at 20 C as catalyst, 5,5-DMNBE gives behaviour intermediate between Types I and IV (Type II, dc = 0-69) whereas 3 gives atactic polymer (Type IV, Oc = 0.53). This might imply a slower propagation rate at 20 C for 3 compared with 5,5-DMNBE, giving more time for conversion of the metal carbene complex to its achiral or epimerised form between each propagation step. However, the continued blockiness im- plies that there are still two distinct propagating species. It would appear, therefore, that mechanisms are available for epimerisation or relaxation to an achiral form for both 14 and 15. With another monomer, namely endo, endo-5,6-dimethylbicyclo[ 2.2.1 ]hept-2-ene, we have even found that WClg/ Bu4Sn at 20 C gives high ci's (&c = 0.91) but atactic polymer, (Or)c = 0.49, supporting the conclusion that there is a route for epimerisation or relaxa- tion to an achiral form before decoordination of the last-formed double bond [15]. It is possible in the light of recent work [16] that a kinetically symmet- rical agostic-type [17] alkylidene complex 16 is a better description of 14 in such high-ci's-directing W-based systems. Such a complex, which will /^i c H^|j \\\"/ --Mt a /! 17 276 propagate atactic polymer formation, has also a possible counterpart in 17. However, we do not believe that these species have much significance for the noble metal catalysts where the t^ set of d orbitals is filled, such that the tendency to form a carbyne complex from a carbene complex is greatly diminished. Conclusions Anfi-7-methylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene is an extremely useful monomer for the investigation of ring-opening polymerisations by metathesis catalysts. The \"C NMR spectra of the polymers gave not only the cis content but also the cis/trans blockiness and the dyad tacticities with respect to both cis and trans double bonds. Furthermore, the polymers can be readily hydrogenated and additional tacticity information derived from the spectra of the products. The tacticity and blockiness data support and extend the mechanism previously proposed [6], especially the important idea that two types of metal-carbene complex propagate metathesis, one in which the last- formed double bond is cis and is still coordinated and the other where the last-formed double bond is trans and has decoordinated. This provides a very general explanation of the origin of the 'cis after c;'s and trans after trans' stereoselectivity feature frequently noted in the metathesis of n-alk-2-enes [18,23]. Experimental The mixture of syn and anti monomers was prepared via literature methods [19 - 21] from cyclohexa-l,3-diene according to Scheme 1. The mixture was analysed by 'H and \"C NMR spectroscopy [21] and by GLC. Bicyclo[2.2.2]oct-2-ene (ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc.) was used as received.

The Ru-TFA catalyst was prepared by Dr. G. M. McCann of these laboratories, as follows: 1.5 g (5.8XKT3 mol) RuCLj-SHzO and 4.3 g (19.5 X 10~3 mol) CF3COOAg were added to 120 cm3 water, mixed well and warmed to 60 C for 2 h. A white solid (AgCl) was filtered off. The dark brown solution was passed through kieselguhr and evaporated to dryness, yielding a black solid. This was taken up in ethanol and again evaporated to yield blackish crystals. Analysis: calc. for R^CFsCOC^-SHaO: C 13.6%, H 0.8%. Found: C 13.24%, H 0.55%. Since this compound has not been fully characterised, we prefer to designate it as the Ru-TFA complex. The polymerisation procedure has also been described before [22]. With noble metal catalyst systems, the polymerisations were conducted in sealed tubes using PhCl/EtOH (1:1 vol) as the solvent. Other polymerisa- tions were conducted under nitrogen in PhCl as the solvent. The hydrogenation of the polymers was carried out in xylene at 120 C using p-CH3CeH4S02NHNH2 as the hydrogenating agent. Details are given elsewhere [22]. \"C NMR spectra were obtained using a Bruker WM250 FT spectro- meter operating at 62.8 MHz, with routine proton decoupling by broad-band irradiation, a spectral width of 12 195 Hz, a pulse interval of 0.67 s and 16 K data points transforming to 8 K. Values of Ti and NOE were obtained by the standard inversion recovery method and gated pulsing method, respectively. Samples were run either as solutions in CDC4 or as gels swollen in CDCIa when they would not dissolve. All chemical shifts are relative to TMS as internal standard. Small variations of chemical shift from sample to sample (in excess of the experimental error) are attributed to an effect of solute concentration. Assignments were made from off-resonance spectra, com- bined with a consideration of substitution parameters (see various tables). References 1 K. J.

Hamilton Kenneth J. Ivin John J. Rooney Department of Chemistry, The Queen's University of Belfast, BT9 5AG U.K. A 51:49 mixture of syn- and anti-7-methylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene was subjected to a number of Ru-, Os-, Ir-, W- and Re-based catalysts, and the structures of the polymers and their hydrogenated analogues determined by 13C NMR spectroscopy. Except in one case, the polymer consisted exclusively of ring-opened units of the anti isomer; the syn isomer could be recovered in good yield. This confirms that the exo face of norbornenes is normally highly reactive whereas the endo face is relatively inert towards metathesis. The exception was the highly reactive (mesitylene)W(CO)3/ EtAlCl2/epoxide catalyst, where a small proportion of syn units was found in the soluble part of the polymer. The same catalyst also polymerises the syn isomer in the presence of a small amount of anti isomer and effects its copolymerisation with norbornene. It will also polymerise bicycio [2.2.2]-oct-2-ene by ring-opening, but not 1,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene. The ring dyad tacticity with respect to both cis and trans junctions could be determined directly from the spectra of the ring-opened polymers of the anti isomer, and the overall tacticity from the spectra of the corresponding hydrogenated polymers. The fractions of m and r dyads for trans and cis junctions respectively are generally in the range 0.5–1.0, but are not always equal, with noble metal catalysts having a tendency (which is especially marked in the case of initiation by the Ru-TFA complex) for trans junctions to be atactic and cis junctions syndic tactic. The cis/trans double bond distribution is often blocky. These results confirm that, in general, two types of metal-carbene complex are important propagating species; one in which the last formed unit (cis) is still coordinated, thereby sterically biasing the next monomer insertion in favour of another cis unit, while in the second the last formed unit (trans) has detached from the metal ion before the metal carbene reacts with monomer, which it then does with a strong bias towards the formation of a trans junction. Various possible chiral and achiral forms of these two species together with appropriate relaxation processes are briefly discussed. References 1 K.J.
