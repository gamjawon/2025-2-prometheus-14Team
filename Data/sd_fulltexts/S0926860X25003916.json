With the Euro 7 regulation, the European Union has set a CO2 emission target of 94 g/km for passenger cars. Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) engine technology has the potential to significantly improve overall fuel economy and thus reduce CO2 emissions. One of the main drawbacks of GDI engines is the high level of particulate emissions (mainly very small particles) compared to conventional gasoline engines. In this context, the efficiency of the active oxygen species released by ceria-praseodymium mixed oxides to oxidise soot under an inert atmosphere has been well demonstrated in a previous work. In the present work, the aim is to analyse the uncatalysed and catalysed combustion behaviour of model soot (Printex-U) and a real GDI soot supplied by CMT-UPV, since soot reactivity is a primary property affecting the dynamics of GPF regeneration. An in-depth knowledge of the oxidation behaviour of the GDI soot with respect to the model soot (Printex-U) was sought by means of TG-MS analysis, by carrying out isothermal tests in the temperature range of interest for the application studied (500–525–550°C), combined with different O2 concentrations (0.25–1.3–16.6 %). These values emulate real operating conditions from very low O2 concentrations, which are governed by lambda control, to high O2 concentrations, which are representative of fuel shutdown events where passive filter regeneration is promoted. Complementary catalytic experiments with selected ceria praseodymia formulations (shown to be very active in previous studies) allowed us to understand the whole combustion process and the feasibility of this strategy in the context of catalysed GPFs.

In addition, the fuel injection control of GDI is more precise than its counterpart, port fuel injection (PFI), resulting in improved potential for higher thermal efficiency and fuel economy. GDI engines also offer higher specific power output than a comparable PFI engine. However, this new technology, introduced by car manufacturers to combat CO2 emissions and improve fuel efficiency, has had the unwanted effect of producing soot in the combustion chamber and subsequent wear. GDI engines achieve this improved fuel economy by injecting fuel at high pressure directly into the combustion chamber of each cylinder, allowing precise control of the timing and amount of fuel injected, resulting in more power from smaller engines [2]. Because the fuel is injected directly into the cylinder, incomplete combustion and fuel dilution can be an issue, resulting in more soot and particulate matter than conventional PFI engines [3,4], especially during warm-up and transient conditions [5]. The main concern with GDI technology is the higher levels of ultrafine particulates, which are even higher than those from diesel engines fitted with diesel particulate filters. GDI units must comply with the limits of 4.5 mg/km and 6.0·1011 #/km for PM and PN respectively. Such limits present a non-trivial challenge for engine manufacturers, as the new regulation (Euro 7) counts particles as small as 10 nm in diameter towards the PM limit, whereas the Euro 6 limit only included particles as small as 23 nm [6,7]. This PN regulation must be met not only in WLTC mode, but also in the Real Driving Emission (RDE) mode introduced in 2018 [6]. New vehicles are also using start-stop technology to improve fuel efficiency. There are concerns that the intermittent stops could lead to an overall increase in PM emissions. In the same line, hybrid models have been shown to increase PM emissions when switching between engine and battery operation. Furthermore, the re-ignition event (start-up) resulted in particle number emission rates more than four times higher than the stabilised PN emission rates for the hybrid vehicle. The driving cycles including cold start and hard acceleration transients result in the highest PM mass and number emissions [5]. Therefore, further reduction of particulate emissions from last generation engines, which are strictly regulated in both mass and number, has become an urgent task [8]. In accordance with the very strict Euro 7 regulation, GDI engines should be equipped with a catalysed gasoline particulate filter (cGPF). In addition to PM/PN filtration efficiency, the cGPF is required to have low pressure drop and high exhaust gas purification performance [9]. Therefore, cGPF could play a key role as an essential component for effective PM and PN abatement and offer a promising technological avenue to meet the requirements of the new Euro 7 regulations for particulate emissions in vehicles [10], regardless of the operating conditions described above. The basic design and operation of a gasoline particulate filter (GPF) is similar to that of a diesel particulate filter (DPF). However, the limited presence of oxidant molecules in a GPF makes the regeneration process even more critical. Unlike a DPF, the upstream three-way catalysts (TWCs) convert CO and HCx at the expense of NOx and O2 [11], making the functions of a cGPF very demanding. According to the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) conditions, the inlet temperature of the DPF can vary between 300 and 500°C during city driving. When the vehicle is travelling at speeds above 80 km/h, allowing soot combustion during the very short and infrequent fuel cut events, such passive regeneration should be controlled so as not to release enormous amounts of heat when a significant amount of soot has accumulated [12]. In this line, catalytic materials that are very stable and active under these demanding conditions are required to design very robust cGPF systems [13]. In this complex scenario, inorganic oxides capable of efficiently generating and transferring active oxygen species to the soot surface would be highly desirable [14]. Martínez-Munuera et al. [15] demonstrated that certain Ce1-xPrxO2-δ formulations exhibited high soot combustion activity with a marked intervention of unlabelled active oxygen species during the long inert period after the 18O2 pulse, mimicking the situation found in a real GDI exhaust. Although transient soot oxidation experiments would be the most representative catalytic tests and the ones that most faithfully reflect the conditions that occur in the exhaust of a direct-injection gasoline engine, the performance of these experiments, together with the necessary data processing and interpretation, presents significant challenges. In this sense, Piqueras et al. [16] developed an interesting work by selecting the O2 concentrations and temperatures according to the values extracted from real GDI engines. For this purpose, these authors combined isothermal TGA tests at representative temperatures (635–670–750℃, selected from the high temperature range) and different O2 concentrations (0.25–1.3–16.6 %). These three concentrations emulate three representative scenarios of GDI emissions: from very low oxygen concentration, governed by the lambda control [17], to high oxygen concentration, representative of fuel cut-off events where passive filter regeneration is promoted [18]. As the GPF inlet temperature can vary between 300 and 500°C during driving, according to the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) test results [19], as mentioned above, the boundary conditions chosen for the present study (500–525–550°C) can be considered as a good reflection of the upper limit of city driving and the lower range of highway driving. Based on all the previous work, and in an attempt to explore the combined effect of temperature (in the range of the temperature intersection of the two driving modes) and oxygen partial pressure, isothermal TGA experiments were designed to combine representative situations in the GDI exhaust. For this purpose, a matrix of TG-MS experiments was approached by combining three representative temperatures (500–525–550℃) with three different O2 concentrations (0.25–1.3–16.6 %) in an attempt to simulate real world conditions during normal stoichiometric λ= 1 operation and fuel cuts. Therefore, this matrix was designed and used to conduct a comprehensive study of the uncatalysed soot combustion process and selected representative conditions for the catalysed soot combustion reaction. Due to the significant influence of soot properties on soot oxidation [20], many recent works have focused on analysing the physicochemical properties of GDI exhaust soot. Gaddam et al. [21] investigated the physicochemical properties of GDI soot and found that the soot produced by different engine operating modes has different morphological and chemical characteristics. They confirmed that the soot characteristics are directly related to the engine operating parameters, including air/fuel ratio and engine load. In the same line, Pfau et al. [22] reported that the formation and oxidation of soot produced by direct gasoline engines is highly dependent on engine operating conditions such as injection modes, cold start conditions or engine speed and load. Even assuming that commercially produced soot is considered to be a more affordable and reproducible replacement for engine soot due to its high cost and strong dependence on the conditions associated with the generation of real engine soot, a comprehensive analysis of the uncatalysed and catalysed performance of GDI real soot compared to standard and well accepted soot surrogates would be highly desirable. Therefore, the present study has a twofold purpose: to deepen the knowledge of the physico-chemical properties of a real GDI soot compared to a well-accepted surrogate, i.e. Printex-U from Evonik-Degussa, and to provide new insights into the effect of the different nature of the soot on the uncatalysed and catalysed soot combustion performance by selecting these two representative soots. Since soot reactivity is a fundamental property that significantly influences the dynamics of GPF regeneration, the analysis of the inherent activity of the soot is of paramount importance. The implications and knowledge gained from the non-catalysed soot combustion tests are relevant to the approach of the catalysed soot combustion process in a subsequent step, as catalysed and non-catalysed soot combustion will co-exist in the GDI exhaust gas due to their higher temperatures (unlike the common approach in diesel soot combustion studies and in terms of cGPF configuration and exact location [23]). The catalysed soot combustion study here presented was carried out using the three most noteworthy catalysts (three home-made CexPr1-xO2-δ oxides) characterised in detail in a previous publication on diesel soot combustion [24], as well as the two soots mentioned: Printex-U, widely used in the literature as a diesel soot surrogate, and a real GDI soot supplied by CMT-Universitat Politécnica de Valencia (UPV). The aim of the present work, based on the analysis of uncatalysed and catalysed soot combustion under conditions very close to those found in the exhaust of GDI engines, is: to shed some light on the reactivity of a real GDI soot, as opposed to the well-known Printex-U, where many controversial results have been published in the literature [11,16,25]. From this point of view, this work should be useful and have practical implications. On the other hand, the advantages of carrying out isothermal experiments at the temperatures of interest (instead of temperature-programmed reactions) are many, opening up the possibility of carrying out kinetic modelling and obtaining the kinetic parameters of interest, as will be explored in a later paper. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials 2.1.1 Soot samples Two different soot samples were used for the corresponding uncatalysed and catalysed soot combustion studies: a commercial carbon black from Evonik-Degussa (Printex-U). This is the most commonly used carbon black and is considered a good surrogate for soot in many studies [11,26–28]) and a real GDI soot. This is the first time in the research group that a real GDI soot has been analysed and represents a novelty and one of the main contributions of this work. The real soot was provided by the CMT-Motores Térmicos group (Universitat Politècnica de València). The GDI soot was collected from successive cold starts of the GDI engine followed by high power operation, which is representative of hybrid vehicle operation. The main characteristics of this engine are presented in Table S1 in the Supplementary Material, together with details of the real soot collection procedure (Figure S1). In order to clarify some aspects of the characterisation, two additional soot samples were included in some parts of the characterisation studies: a Cabot carbon black (Vulcan XC-72R), which is a very pure carbon black, and a real diesel soot from Renault (utilised in previous studies [26]). 2.1.2 Catalysts Three home-made CexPr1-xO2-δ oxides with different nominal compositions in cerium and/or praseodymium (x = 0, 0.2 and 0.3; where x refers to the cerium content) were prepared, including pure praseodymia. The solids were prepared from an intimate mixture of cerium nitrate and praseodymium nitrate precursors by taking the required amounts and mixing in a mortar for 10 min. This was followed by a calcination step at 500 ºC for 1 h in static air. This method was chosen for its simplicity and sustainability compared to other more common methods, such as co-precipitation under alkaline media [14,24]. The selected compositions gave satisfactory results for both diesel soot combustion analysis and for soot combustion under inert atmosphere [14,24]. The characterisation of these catalysts has been reported elsewhere [24] and a corresponding brief summary can be found in the Supplementary Material (Table S2). 2.2 Characterisation techniques TEM analyses of the soot samples were carried out using a JEOL microscope (JEM-1400) operating at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The maximum resolution obtained is 0.14 nm between lines and 0.25 nm between points. A few droplets of an ultrasonically dispersed suspension in ethanol of each soot sample were placed on a grid (300 mesh copper grid coated with LACEY and evaporated carbon). The suspension was dried under ambient conditions (22°C and 40 % humidity). X-ray diffractograms of the obtained soot samples and the catalysts were recorded in a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer equipped with a copper anode. The equipment includes a Goëbel mirror for non-planar samples, a high temperature chamber (up to 900°C) and a Kristalloflex K 760–80 F X-ray generator (power: 3000 W, voltage: 20–60 kV and current: 5–80 mA). Diffractograms were recorded between 20° and 80°. The scan rate used was 1°/min and the wavelength employed was 0.1540598 nm, corresponding to CuKα radiation. Raman spectra of the obtained soot samples and the corresponding catalysts were recorded in a Jovin-Ivon dispersive Raman spectrometer, model LabRam, equipped with a confocal microscope, a He-Ne laser source (632 nm) and a charge-coupled device (CCD) detector cooled by Peltier effect. The C, H, N, S compositions of the soot samples obtained were determined by elemental analysis (also known as ultimate analysis) performed on an Elemental CHNS Microanalyzer with LECO Micro TruSpec detection system by carrying out a controlled combustion of the sample in a pure oxygen atmosphere, by passing the gases produced through a system of columns containing specific reagents (metallic copper and WO3) which, after oxidation of the sample, ensure the complete conversion of the gases produced into CO2, N2, SO2 and H2O respectively. The proximate analysis of the soot samples obtained was carried out on a METTLER TOLEDO thermogravimetric differential thermal analyser (model TGA/SDTA851e/SF/1100). The analysis is carried out in three successive steps: (i) moisture quantification: the sample was first heated under He flow at 115°C for 30 min and cooled to room temperature; (ii) volatile matter quantification: the sample was heated under He flow at 900°C for 15 min and cooled to room temperature; (iii) fixed carbon quantification: the inert gas is then changed to an oxidising atmosphere (60 ml/min He+60 ml/min air) and the sample is heated at 800°C for 15 min and, subsequently, cooled to room temperature. The air is then replaced with helium. The weight loss observed during combustion is related to the percentage of fixed carbon in the sample and the residual mass is related to the percentage of ash. All proximate analysis measurements were made at room temperature under a flow of helium, and all heating and cooling steps were performed at 10 °C/min. BET surface areas were measured by multi-point N2 adsorption at 196°C using an automated Autosorb-6B (Quantachrome equipment). The samples (both soot samples and catalysts) were previously degassed under vacuum at 200°C for 4 h. 2.3 Soot combustion experiments The information obtained from isothermal reactions is very useful because they are experiments that simulate the conditions of the GPFs in the GDI exhaust system. For this purpose, a matrix of TG-MS experiments for uncatalysed soot combustion was approached by combining three representative temperatures (500–525–550℃) with three different O2 concentrations (0.25–1.3–16.6 %) in an attempt to simulate real conditions during normal stoichiometric operation λ= 1 and fuel cuts [16–18]. Therefore, this matrix was designed and used to perform a comprehensive study of the uncatalysed soot combustion process by selecting two representative soots (Printex-U and GDI soot). The soot combustion tests were carried out in a simultaneous thermogravimetric system (TG-DSC) coupled to a mass spectrometer (MS). The thermogravimetric instrument is a TA Instruments SDT Q600 and the mass spectrometer is a Balzers Instruments Thermostar model. The soot (1 mg) was placed in the corresponding crucible. After evacuation at 150°C by a heating ramp (10℃/min) for 60 min under He, the soot was oxidised under isothermal conditions (500, 525 or 550ºC) with a specific O2/He composition (up to 60 % soot conversion in most cases, except for the experiments characterised by very low reactivities). After this isothermal step, a final TPO was performed in the same atmosphere to estimate the corresponding carbon mass balance, using a heating ramp of 10℃/min up to 950℃. The catalysed soot combustion study was carried out using a catalyst/soot ratio of 20/1 under the so-called loose contact mode. Specifically, ceria-praseodymia mixed oxides were selected to evaluate the combustion of soot at 500℃ under 1.3 % oxygen concentration (and 0.25 % in selected cases). Throughout the experiment, the gas flow rate is 100 ml/min. Preliminary tests were conducted to assess quantitative reproducibility by repeating the same experiment four times under the following conditions: 1.3 % O₂, 500 °C and the most active catalyst (Ce₀.₃Pr₀.₇O₂), with Printex-U acting as the soot. Considering the isothermal combustion step (as shown in Fig. 5a), the deviation from the results of the presented experiment can be estimated as ±3 %. Using the mass spectrometer detector, the signals corresponding to water (m/z 18), carbon monoxide (m/z 28), oxygen (m/z 32) and carbon dioxide (m/z 44) are monitored during the soot combustion experiment. Calcium oxalate monohydrate was used to calibrate the emission of water (H2O), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The selectivity towards CO2 emission obtained in each test was determined using the following equation: (1) CO2 /COx (%) = 100·CO2/(CO+CO2) 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Uncatalysed soot combustion: impact of the reaction temperature and oxygen concentration on the soot combustion profiles rates and CO2 selectively As anticipated, the effect of the O2 concentration on this context (GDI exhaust) was investigated at the chosen temperatures, (500–525–550°C), according to literature data, by varying the O2 concentration, (ranging from 0.25, 1.3, and 16.6 %), as mentioned above. This allows us to obtain the so-called 3 × 3 matrix. The results are presented in separate Figures, for every temperature (500–525–550°C) in terms of the temporal evolution of m/minitial of soot ratios (residual soot mass normalized to its initial value). Following this procedure, the m/minitial of soot is defined as ranging from 1 to 0 in all the tests) versus time (details of the calculation are described in the Supplementary Material). With these very simple representations, the soot conversion profiles are represented from the initial time when the reactive atmosphere is fed to the thermobalance, and the first part of stabilization under He, until achieving the reaction temperature is not considered (the full protocol is described in the next section). Fig. 1 illustrates the uncatalysed soot consumption under the selected conditions mentioned above. All the profiles show quasi-linear trends, starting from an initial value of 1 (m/minitial of soot) and leading to distinct final conversion values, depending on the percentage of oxygen in the reaction atmosphere and the reaction temperature chosen. After a proper analysis of these representations, the outcomes are described as main guidelines and summarised as follows: - Soot combustion takes place even at the very low oxygen concentration of 0.25 % and the lowest temperature tested of 500°C. - As a general trend, an increase in temperature from 500 to 525°C enhances the soot conversion rates, but the next temperature increment, from 525 to 550°C, increases the activity to a much greater extent: - 500 < 525 < <550°C - The differences in activities due to the different oxygen concentrations used become lower and lower as the reaction temperature increases. - GDI soot is more reactive than Printex-U, but the differences become smaller as the temperature increases. At 550°C, the profiles of the two soots even overlap, as can be seen in Fig. 1.c. All of these results could point out to a possible change in the rate-determining step as the temperature increases. It could be suggested that the rate-determining steps could be related to the inherent reactivity of the soot at the lowest reaction temperatures, as a first approach [29]. It is well observed that linearity occurs even at a very low O2 concentration of 0.25 % for Printex-U. Irrespective of the O2 concentration used, the GDI soot consistently shows higher (or slightly higher) reactivity than the model soot, in agreement with some previous studies [30]. A very thorough study was reported by Choi et al. [31], who found that the overall oxidation reactivity of several GDI soots was higher than that of Printex-U. This was mainly attributed to the catalytic effects of ashes. Nevertheless, the aforementioned GDI soots exhibited almost constant intrinsic carbon oxidation reactivity, which remained unaffected by engine operating conditions. This conclusion is interesting in terms of comparing different studies. The observed reactivities at the proposed O2 concentrations result in significantly different experiment durations. This can have a significant impact on the design of the experimental tests. For example, in Fig. 1.a, GDI soot at 0.25 % O2 reaches only 10 % conversion after 500 min, whereas at 16.6 % O2, a 60 % soot conversion is achieved in only 70 min. These results clearly emphasize the significant influence of O2 concentration at this temperature (500°C) and confirm the findings of Zouaoui et al. [32]. According to these authors, carbon gasification by oxygen is insignificant in the temperature range of 300–400°C. However, above 500°C, it exhibits measurable oxidation rates. The oxygen concentration affects differently on the soot reactivities in terms of the reaction temperature because as the temperature increases, the soot combustion rates tend to reach higher conversion values: 500 < 525 < <550°C, mainly at very low O2 concentrations (where a slight increase in concentration from 0.25 % to 1.3 % seems to be more critical at the lowest temperatures). Meanwhile, at the highest temperature, the activity of the two soots remains almost identical. Taking into account the different physico-chemical and structural features of GDI compared to Printex-U (higher ash content and volatile matter, less fixed carbon, as well as lower degree of order, as shown in the previous sections), GDI soot is quite more reactive than Printex-U, but the reaction conditions are critical. At the highest reaction temperature (together with 1.3 % and 16.6 % of O2 concentration), the different physico-chemical properties of the GDI soot compared to the model soot do not seem to be relevant. At 0.25 % of O2 concentration, the impact of the temperature on the soot reactivity is more evident. It is interesting to note that at the beginning of the reaction at the lowest temperature, (500°C), the profile of the GDI soot at 1.3 % of O2 is more similar to that of Printex-U tested at 16.6 % of O2 than both soot profiles are under the same experimental conditions. This coincidence can also be seen, when comparing the pair 1.3 % O2 Printex-U/0.25 % GDI soot. These correlations are very interesting to analyse because they lead to the assessment that the milder the reaction conditions, the more relevant the nature of the soot tested. From the emission rates of CO2 and CO (the corresponding reaction products), the soot combustion rates were estimated and represented in terms of the soot conversion percentages. These representations complement properly the corresponding information extracted from weight losses in terms of time. A brief discussion is included in the Supplementary Information. The maximum soot combustion rates obtained (taken from Figure S4 are now plotted against the reaction temperature (see Fig. 2.a) for all the experimental conditions analysed. In general, the value of soot combustion rate increases with temperature (more clearly and reaching linearity at the highest oxygen concentration). This means that for the particular case of very low oxygen concentration, the soot combustion is very slow, and no clear correlations can be given for the maximum value increase. Conversely, in the simulated situation of a fuel cut (a deceleration with air intake), the regression coefficient is excellent (especially in the case of GDI soot, which is 0.99), allowing us to state that temperature is the most important variable in defining the maximum soot combustion rate when the O2 supply is high and guarantees the presence of sufficient oxygen molecules in the reaction stream. The linearity observed for Printex-U is also interesting (r2 = 0.93). On the other hand, when this parameter (maximum soot combustion rate) is plotted against the oxygen partial pressure (the other variable tested in this study, in the corresponding Fig. 2.b), the regression coefficients obtained are closer to 1 for almost all conditions, indicating that the oxygen partial pressure is a more relevant parameter for defining the maximum oxidation rate than the temperature. Again, the effect of oxygen partial pressure obeys a much more satisfactory linearity for GDI soot than for Printex-U, as shown in Fig. 2.b. All these experimental results and correlations are of paramount importance for understanding the GPF regeneration located in a GDI vehicle. To complete the discussion of the soot combustion behaviour, it is worth mentioning the conclusions of the analysis of the selectivity towards CO2 in terms of temperature and O2 concentration (in parallel with the analysis presented above) for each soot. The selectivity towards CO2 formation is determined using Eq. 1 and is presented in Fig. 3 as a function of temperature and oxygen concentration. The data analysis shows that the GDI soot has a higher selectivity towards CO2 formation than the model soot (Printex-U) under all conditions tested. In Fig. 3.a it is well observed that the selectivity towards CO2 decreases with increasing temperature, which was an expected result considering the literature [29,33,34]. It is well known that the ratio of CO to CO2 in oxidation/combustion reactions increases with increasing temperature. At low temperatures, CO2 is the main product, whereas at high temperatures and low oxygen partial pressure, CO becomes the dominant product. This observation is supported by references [29,33,34] which state that the CO/CO2 ratio in oxidation/combustion reactions is temperature dependent. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3.b, there is an increase in selectivity with higher oxygen concentrations. These results are consistent with previous results reported in the literature [33–35]. However, when comparing the regression coefficients obtained from Fig. 3.b with those estimated from Fig. 3.a, it is evident that the derived regression coefficients are generally less robust than those obtained for the temperature parameter. This suggests that the reaction temperature has a tremendous impact on the selectivity towards CO2, while its influence on defining the maximum soot combustion rate if it exists, remains more diluted or dissipated (except in the case of 16.6 % O2 concentration). On the other hand, (when all the experimental conditions are grouped and analysed together), the O2 concentration has a greater influence on the definition of the maximum soot combustion rate, while its influence on selectivity is more limited. Irrespective of the parameter study, GDI soot always offers better relationships (if linear regression coefficients are considered), which can be very positive for predicting soot combustion behaviour in order to carry out modelling tasks. 3.2 Catalysed soot combustion 3.2.1 Comparative discussion between model soot and real soot catalysed combustion. Description of all the steps of the experiment By selecting the specific conditions (1.3 % O2 and 500°C), a series of experiments were carried out with Printex-U and GDI soot using the catalysts selected for this study (PrO2, Ce0.2Pr0.8O2 and Ce0.3Pr0.7O2). The three steps of the whole experiment are shown in Fig. 4 for the most active catalyst (as a representative example). The O2 percentage in the middle of the O2 concentration interval (1.3 %) and the lowest temperature (500°C) were chosen as representative conditions in order to study more clearly the influence of the nature of the soot [14]. These experiments will allow us to make comparisons between the effects of the choice of one or other soot in all the steps of the designed catalytic test, once the uncatalysed combustion has been analysed in depth. Therefore, the results presented in this study refer only to CO2 emissions, as the use of this particular set of catalysts was found to result in negligible CO emissions during the corresponding tests (as will be explained in the next subsection 3.2.2). Fig. 4 shows the complete soot oxidation profiles (expressed as CO2 emission rates) of the model and real soot using the Ce0.3Pr0.7O2 catalyst. It is relevant to describe all the results and the corresponding patterns through all the steps of the designed soot combustion tests because, due to the high activity of the selected catalysts (even under inert atmosphere), some soot combustion activity could be found in the pre-treatment step (under He), thus affecting the following stage (the isothermal soot combustion step). Therefore, the information presented in Fig. 4 reflects the three steps carried out, which are as follows: (1) Pre-treatment under inert gas (He) up to 500°C, in ramp mode (10 °C/min), followed by a short isothermal step of 30 min. (2) Isothermal combustion at 500°C under 1.3 % O2/He. (3) Temperature programmed oxidation (TPO), in ramp mode (10 °C/min) up to 900°C. The profiles in Fig. 4 show that there are certain differences in terms of the soot selected from the very first step of pre-treatment under He. Previous work has demonstrated the ability of ceria-praseodymium mixed oxides to oxidise soot even under an inert atmosphere and loose contact between the catalysts and the soot [14,15]. Therefore, the CO2 emission peak profiles during step (1) are due to three main causes that could occur simultaneously since fresh catalysts were used: i) the possible \"decarbonisation\" of the catalyst (see Figure S9 in the Supplementary Material for more details), ii) the decomposition of surface oxygen groups of any soot, which will be greater for GDI soot compared to Printex-U, and finally, iii) a more accentuated reactivity of GDI soot compared to Printex-U, which is notorious even under inert atmosphere. Once the isothermal step starts at 500°C, the CO2 emission decays very sharply. As soon as O2 is fed into the thermobalance at 500°C (step (2)), a very sharp increase in CO2 emission is observed, up to a maximum value of 18 µmol CO2/s·gsoot for the GDI soot. After reaching the maximum rate, an abrupt decrease in CO2 emission is observed, more pronounced for the GDI soot, due to the higher amount of soot consumed at this point compared to Printex-U. This way of analysing the soot combustion plots is very useful as it allows all the details of the whole catalytic test to be appreciated in a simple way. In this line, the GDI soot catalysed with Ce0.3Pr0.7O2 would be characterised by very fast soot combustion rates in a very short time (just at the beginning of the experiment), with a pronounced decay thereafter. In fact, the last part of the experiment (consisting of a TPO until the complete combustion of the remaining sample in order to carry out the carbon mass balances, step (3), for more details see Table S7 in the Supplementary Material) shows that almost all the GDI soot in the crucible was consumed in a very short time (about two and a half hours), in contrast to Printex-U. In the case of the model soot, although the isothermal step was extended to more than five hours, the mild oxidation conditions tested were not sufficient and a much greater amount of Printex-U remained in the crucible and was eventually oxidised during the final TPO. The results are therefore very interesting and show, a priori, the suitability of these catalyst formulations to achieve fast dynamics of gasoline filter regeneration. In conclusion, the inherent nature of the soot influences its intrinsic reactivity, and this affects all the steps of the catalytic test designed, with the catalytic response of the GDI soot being more advantageous from a practical point of view than that of the model soot. 3.2.2 Combined analysis of the effect of the nature of the catalyst and the soot on the catalysed soot combustion activity With all these considerations in mind, it is now possible to study the influence of each catalyst on the catalysed soot combustion performance. For this purpose, Fig. 5(a-b) shows the curves of the catalytic soot oxidation reaction obtained under 1.3 % oxygen in helium at 500°C, expressed as the m/minitial of soot ratio versus time, for the model soot and the real soot, respectively. To provide a basis for comparison, the Figures also include the uncatalysed profiles of both soot types. As expected, the combustion profiles are much more pronounced when a catalyst is used, either with model soot or GDI soot, compared to the non-catalysed profiles. The gradation of catalytic activity also appears to be a function of the type of catalyst and the type of soot. The catalytic order in the case of Printex-U is quite gradual and independent of the progress of the reaction. In other words, the order of catalytic activity is always the same. However, it is interesting to note that due to the high initial reactivity of some catalysts over GDI soot, the order of catalytic activity is the same as that observed for Printex-U at very low conversions, but as soon as the time on stream increases, the order changes considering the pair of the two most reactive catalysts. This deviation could be attributed to the high initial reactivity of the catalyst on GDI soot. In simpler terms, the reaction rate may change more rapidly at this early stage due to the increased catalyst activity and the nature of the soot (high ash content, etc.). All these conditions could create that more fraction of initial soot is oxidised in the pre-treatment, thus affecting the profile of the soot combustion curve. This can be considered a tentative explanation for the profiles seen in Fig. 5b. Analysing the catalytic profiles shown in Fig. 5, it can be seen that the role of the catalyst is quite evident from the first seconds of the isothermal test. For the Ce0.3Pr0.7 O2/Ce0.2Pr0.8O2 pair, the increase in activity with respect to PrO2 is remarkable. This is consistent with the physicochemical properties of the oxides, which were well described elsewhere [10,24] and presented in Table S2. These desired properties include a balanced combination of textural properties (such as a BET surface area of 42 m2/g for Ce0.3Pr0.7 O2 and of 31 m2/g for Ce0.2Pr0.8O2) and redox properties (similar and very pronounced oxygen release capacity, especially at low temperatures), as reported in previous works [10,24]). Supplementary information can be provided in Fig. 6, which serves as a valuable guide for following the variation of the soot combustion rate, emphasising its importance. The CO2 emission rate is shown alone because CO2 is the primary product to be monitored due to its high selectivity, which exceeds 96 %. This high level of selectivity ensures accurate and reliable monitoring, providing a clear and focused perspective on the positive environmental impact of the catalysed combustion process. This means that the catalyst facilitates the oxidation of carbon monoxide, leading to its conversion into carbon dioxide (CO2), a non-toxic gas. This allows us to conclude that the catalyst acts as both a source and a reservoir of oxygen [36] (the corresponding CO profiles are shown in Figure S10 in the Supplementary Material, just to prove that the CO emission rate is much lower than that of the corresponding uncatalysed experiment). According to Fig. 6, the activity is very fast from the beginning of the experiment, without the short \"induction period\" typical of the uncatalysed reaction, (especially evident for Printex-U) and the maximum rate is reached as soon as the reactive gas is fed to the crucible, in contrast to the behaviour of Printex-U (whose maximum CO2 emission rate is reached after 25 min). The profiles of the three catalysed reactions are in complete agreement with the physico-chemical properties of the catalysts tested (see Table S2). This high initial CO2 emission could be advantageous for the regeneration of a catalysed gasoline particulate filter (cGPF) [37]. Finally, the lower CO2 emission rates at the end of the test compared to the uncatalysed experiment can be attributed to the fact that there are very low amounts of soot in the crucible and that the most reactive part of the loaded soot has already been oxidised. While comparing the profiles of the catalysed reactions, it is noted that catalysed soot combustion responses are better, (considering all the relevant catalytic parameters), when GDI soot is employed versus Printex-U, hence higher maximum CO2 emission rates (maintained for longer times) for GDI soot are measured, and the curves become closer and closer to each other as the catalyst's activity increases. Actually, the initial combustion rate of the uncatalysed GDI soot expressed as CO2 emitted in µmoles/s·ginitial of soot is almost so high than that of Printex-U with the catalyst (PrO2), which might have a remarkable impact on the GPF’s regeneration. The influence of the catalyst is more notorious for GDI soot, whatever the catalyst considered, and very high oxidation rates are achieved at low and medium soot conversion values. The catalytic activity can be ranked in the following sequence: The set of praseodymium-based catalysts selected appears to exhibit effective interaction with gas-phase O2, even at concentrations as low as 0.25 % (see complementary information depicted on Figure S11). This suggests that the catalyst is capable of efficiently facilitating reactions involving oxygen, even when it is present in relatively small amounts in the gas mixture [38]. These findings indirectly support the occurrence of the Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism, where the catalyst itself provides oxygen, and then the gas-phase O2 replenishes the oxygen vacancies of the catalyst. As a significant result of practical interest, the CO2 selectivity, indicating that the catalyst enabled the effective oxidation of CO to CO2, even in the very low oxygen concentration (quasi-stoichiometric conditions), exceeded 94 %. Furthermore, the combustion profiles are remarkably distinct, indicating a high catalytic response consistent with the anticipated catalytic order. The primary disparity between 1.3 % and 0.25 % O2 lies in the slower rates of soot combustion and smoother combustion profiles. Nevertheless, the final soot combustion rates (at the same time intervals) are remarkably similar. This underlines a key concept: under stoichiometric conditions, where uncatalysed soot combustion is almost negligible, the role of the catalyst may be to initiate and sustain the soot combustion process. During deceleration (fuel cut-off with oxygen intake), the rapid catalysed reaction, coupled with contributions from the uncatalysed pathway, can provide a combined and effective dynamic of GPF regeneration. It is worth noting that the maximum value of the uncatalysed real GDI soot oxidation rate is similar to that of the catalysed Printex-U (with PrO2). To conclude the discussion of these variables, and in order to analyse the data accurately and obtain more comparable activity values for this study, a comparative assessment of the maximum rates of uncatalysed and catalysed soot combustion was made in conjunction with the CO2 selectivity data. The resulting data are presented in Fig. 7 as a bar graph, which provides a clear visual comparison of the activity values and CO2 selectivity between the different catalyst samples. The analysis shows a significant increase in the maximum soot combustion rates when a catalyst is used, with this effect being more pronounced when GDI soot is tested. In particular, praseodymia shows poorer catalytic data compared to the two mixed oxides, which is consistent with the results presented in [24] and is also in line with the better physico-chemical properties of the two mixed oxides. Of particular interest is the consistent and significant effect of all catalysts on the selectivity parameter. The catalysts consistently show improved selectivity towards CO2 as the primary (or secondary) reaction product. For this reason, as explained above, only the CO2 emission rates are presented. Again, the effectiveness of all catalysts in promoting the selectivity towards CO2 production over CO should be emphasised. When a highly active catalyst is used with GDI soot, there is a more significant increase in activity promotion from a proportional perspective. Looking closely at Fig. 7 and comparing the GDI soot data/Printex-U data in terms of maximum soot combustion rates, it is evident that these ratios follow an increasing order: uncatalysed < PrO2 < Ce0.2Pr0.8O2 < Ce0.3Pr0.7 O2. This trend underlines that the more reactive the soot, the more advantageous the use of a highly active catalyst. Furthermore, when estimating a theoretical proportional factor based on the maximum combustion rate data represented by the bars, these ratios progressively increase from the uncatalysed data to the data associated with Ce0.3Pr0.7O2, which is identified as the most active catalyst (see Table 1). Finally, Table 1 shows the percentages of soot conversion during the first minutes of the reaction, when the regeneration behaviour should be more intense. As shown in the Table, during the first 10 min of regeneration, when soot would be deposited on the filter walls, only 2 % of Printex-U would be burnt off in the case of an uncoated GPF and 5 % in the case of a GDI real soot. In contrast, the use of a catalyst results in a much higher soot combustion, even when using pure praseodymia with its low surface area, thus mimicking a highly \"sintered\" or \"aged\" catalyst. The superior responses are evident when the two mixed oxides are used with GDI soot, promoting regeneration even under these very demanding conditions (500℃ and extremely low oxygen concentration, quasi-stoichiometric conditions). It is very important to keep in mind that the present research only lays the groundwork in a preliminary way on the potential interest of the present catalysts in the catalysed combustion of GDI soot. Further rigorous studies should follow that analyse the impact of the presence of water vapor, as it has been found that its presence can affect the oxidation rate of the soots [39] and the selectivity towards CO2, but its impact is poorly understood, mainly in the presence of catalysts [40]. In this sense, conditions closer to automotive exhaust gas aftertreatment should be approached. In summary, the comprehensive results obtained so far show that the differences in catalysed soot combustion are due to the different physico-chemical properties of the two catalysts and the soots. Although these variations are not (in principle) so relevant, they do characterise the unique and different behaviour of the two soots. These variations include slight structural differences, but are primarily manifested by differences in chemical composition, particularly in terms of oxygen content, volatile content and ash content, as discussed along the soot characterisation. Together, these differences contribute to the increased reactivity of GDI soot under all conditions tested. In particular, these differences are accentuated with the most reactive catalysts, highlighting the potential effectiveness of praseodymium-based oxide coated gasoline particulate filters (GPFs) as an interesting way to achieve exceptionally high performance under the demanding conditions required for GPF regeneration. This suggests that the use of GPFs coated with this family of catalysts holds promise for improving the dynamics and efficiency of GPF regeneration processes by combining high activity under catalytic conditions with some contribution from the uncatalysed GDI soot reaction. 4 Conclusions The comparison of physicochemical properties between real roots and commercial soot has been studied in detail, and the following conclusions can be highlighted. The four investigated soot samples have a qualitatively comparable microstructure, consisting of spherules with a core-shell structure, with long-range layers concentrically distributed along the outermost periphery and short layers amorphously structured inside the core. Although no major changes were found between the methodologies utilized, Raman analysis results suggest that Vulcan has the most ordered structure. GDI soot similar to the diesel soot, appears to be less ordered compared to the model soot (Printex-U). Model soot samples include more carbon and have fewer of amounts heteroatoms than real soot samples. Model soots present higher fixed carbon percentages and lower volatile matter, ash, and moisture percentages than real soot samples. The most significant differences among the two real soot samples analyzed are the volatile matter/fixed carbon contents, which are directly related to the type of engine and the engine operating conditions (idle or loaded) and the textural properties being better for Printex-U with high surface area, Vp and dpore than GDI soot in agreement with their corresponding distribution in particles sizes. In the light of all the results obtained, it can be asserted that Printex-U’s properties are closer to those of GDI soot than those of D-soot. The main conclusions of the study referred to the uncatalysed and catalysed soot reaction in the exhaust of direct injection gasoline engines are as follows: The oxygen concentration has a different effect on the soot reactivities with respect to the reaction temperature, because as the temperature increases, the soot combustion rates reach higher conversion values in trend: 500 < 525 < <550°C, mainly at very low O2 concentrations (where a slight increase in concentration from 0.25 % to 1.3 % seems to be more critical at the lowest temperatures). GDI soot shows higher reactivity than model soot, with catalytic effects significantly increasing the reactivity of GDI soot, especially at lower temperatures and oxygen concentrations. The different chemical composition in Printex-U results in a theoretically lower reactivity compared to GDI engine soot. The oxygen partial pressure is a more relevant parameter in determining the maximum oxidation rate than the reaction temperature. On the contrary, the reaction temperature has an enormous influence in defining the selectivity towards CO2 and the oxygen concentration is less determinant. GDI soot achieves a better selectivity value than Printex-U, for whatever conditions tested. The influence of the catalyst is evident from the start of the isothermal test with a marked increase in activity for the Ce0.3Pr0.7O2/Ce0.2Pr0.8O2 mixed oxide pair. Furthermore, the inherent nature of the soot influences its intrinsic reactivity and this affects all steps of the designed catalytic test, with the catalytic response of the GDI soot being more advantageous from a practical point of view than that of the model carbon black. The catalysts consistently show improved selectivity towards CO2 as the primary reaction product, indicating their effectiveness in promoting this selectivity: the estimated theoretical proportional factor, based on the maximum combustion rate ratios for the two soots, increases from the uncatalysed data to the data associated with Ce0.3Pr0.7O2, identified as the most effective catalyst. Ceria-praseodymia catalysts are highly suitable for use under demanding GDI conditions due to their fast soot combustion dynamics, very high CO2 selectivities and very high combustion rates from the very beginning of the reaction.

Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) engine technology has the potential to significantly improve overall fuel economy and thus reduce CO2 emissions. One of the main drawbacks of GDI engines is the high level of particulate emissions (mainly very small particles) compared to conventional gasoline engines. In this context, the efficiency of the active oxygen species released by ceria-praseodymium mixed oxides to oxidise soot under an inert atmosphere has been well demonstrated in a previous work. In the present work, the aim is to analyse the uncatalysed and catalysed combustion behaviour of model soot (Printex-U) and a real GDI soot supplied by CMT-UPV, since soot reactivity is a primary property affecting the dynamics of GPF regeneration. An in-depth knowledge of the oxidation behaviour of the GDI soot with respect to the model soot (Printex-U) was sought by means of TG-MS analysis, by carrying out isothermal tests in the temperature range of interest for the application studied (500–525–550°C), combined with different O2 concentrations (0.25–1.3–16.6 %). These values emulate real operating conditions from very low O2 concentrations, which are governed by lambda control, to high O2 concentrations, which are representative of fuel shutdown events where passive filter regeneration is promoted. Complementary catalytic experiments with selected ceria praseodymia formulations (shown to be very active in previous studies) allowed us to understand the whole combustion process and the feasibility of this strategy in the context of catalysed GPFs.",
