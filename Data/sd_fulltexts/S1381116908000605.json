Partial oxidation of CH4 using molecular oxygen has been carried out over various commercial silicas and alumina doped silica catalysts using a flow reactor system. Partial oxidation products such as C2H6, C2H4, HCHO, CH3OH, and CO were formed over these catalysts as well as over a quartz reactor only. The presence of Al ions in silica remarkably enhanced the formation of C2H6, H2, HCHO, and CO even at low O2 concentrations. States of Al ions in silica were studied using MAS NMR of 27Al. The results indicated that tetrahedrally coordinated Al(4) ions seem to be present and be isolated in silica. The mechanism of CH4 oxidation is proposed under the heterogeneous participation of O2 activated on such sites. Graphical abstract Keywords Partial oxidation of CH4 C2H6 and HCHO formations Al doped silica catalysts MAS NMR spectra of 27Al 1 Introduction Several reviews concerning the partial oxidation of CH4 have been reported previously [1–4]. The direct conversion of CH4 into partial oxidation products has been reported using glass-coated reactors or pyrex and quartz reactors [5–7]. Partial oxidation of CH4 using O2 has been reported with supported catalysts such as Fe-silica, [8–12] V-silica, [13–15] Mo-silica [16–18] and various elements-silica [19]. Some workers have also studied CH4 oxidations over SiO2 itself [20–22]. In the past, we have also reported the partial oxidation of CH4 over various commercial silicas, over those prepared from metal Si [23,24] and over ZSM-5(MFI) zeolite [25,26] at low CH4 pressure of ca. 10mmHg using a closed circulation system and quartz reactor. In this work, activities of CH4 partial oxidation over commercial silicas were compared using a flow reactor system instead of a circulation system. Partial oxidation products were formed such as HCHO, CH3OH, C2H6, C2H4, and CO, which were nearly the same as those in homogeneous processes. ADM silica that contains Al impurities exhibited high activities. Then, Al doped silica catalysts were prepared and partial oxidation of CH4 was examined over them. The states of doped Al oxide in silica was studied by MAS NMR. Heterogeneous roles of Al ions in the CH4 oxidation and tentative reaction mechanism were discussed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials ADM silica catalyst was provided from Shin-Etsu Chemicals (Japan). Silica gel 60 (extra pure, MERCK) and A300 silica (Japan Aerosil) were used. The surface area and impurities in these silicas are shown in Table 1 .The Al doped silica catalysts in this work were prepared by an impregnation method using Al(NO3)3 (Wako chemicals, Japan) solution and Silica gel 60 (extra pure, MERCK). The catalysts 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0wt% of Al2O3 in Silica gel 60 were heated at 1000°C after dryness. Reactant gases were obtained from a cylinder standard gas (CH4:N2 =1:1 or 2:1, Taiyo-Nissan company, Japan) and air (21% of O2, Okaya Sanso, Japan). 2.2 Reactors Partial oxidation of CH4 was carried out using flow system. The reactor is made of quartz (or pyrex) glass and with a diameter of 18 or 10mm. About 100mm of quartz reactor was heated at desired temperatures by furnace. Methane and air were adjusted using mass flow controllers to make the flow speed 28ml/min at STP. The reaction times were calculated as ca. 18 and 5.5s at 650°C. Silica and Al/silica catalysts were placed in the reactor with quartz wool. The reaction temperature was controlled around 550–650°C by the temperature controller. 2.3 Analysis of products CH3OH was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) using FID detector, PEG 400 column, and He carrier gas. CO and H2 were analyzed quantitatively using Molecular sieve (MS-5A) column and Ar carrier gas. The remaining methane was evacuated at −196°C from a sample tube, then the condensed C2H6, C2H4 and CO2 were analyzed by Porapack Q column and HCHO by APS-201 (GL science, Japan) column, respectively, using He carrier gas. 2.4 Characterization of Al/silica catalysts by MAS NMR spectra MAS NMR spectra of 27Al of Al/silica catalysts were obtained using JEOL JNM-LA300 spectrometer (Japan). The spectra were recorded at a frequency of 78.18MHz, with a pulse length 2μs, a spinning speed of 5700–6000Hz and measuring times of 24–48h. A γ-Al2O3 powder was chosen as a reference sample. The spectra of 0.1–1.0wt% Al2O3/silica catalysts were measured. That of 0.05wt% Al2O3/silica could not be obtained because its signal was too weak to get a spectrum. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Partial oxidation of CH4 in the presence and absence of silica catalysts Fig. 1 shows the results of CO formation rates as a function of O2/(O2 +CH4). In the presence of ADM silica, CO formation exhibits high activities even at low O2 concentrations. Little or no formation of CO was observed at low (3–14%) O2 concentrations in the absence of ADM silica, i.e., only quartz or pyrex reactors. Rates of CO formation increase remarkably above 40–50% of O2/(O2 +CH4) and furthermore, the difference of them in the presence and absence of ADM silica becomes smaller. Table 2 shows the results of C2H6, C2H4 and H2 formations. The C2H6 formation is higher at low concentration of O2 (3–14%) in the presence of ADM silica. The C2H4 formation becomes higher at above 30% of O2. At around 30% of O2, C2H6 and C2H4 formations exhibit the same rates. Rates of C2H6 depend on the low O2 concentrations. The rates of H2 formation are higher in the range of 3–14% of O2 than those of C2H6 and C2H4 (Table 2). Fig. 2 shows the selectivities of CH3OH and HCHO as well as other hydrocarbons. ADM silica exhibits only 1% of selectivity to CH3OH and HCHO and several % to C2H6 and C2H4. Little difference is observed between CO2 formation in the presence and absence of ADM silica (Fig. 3 ). These indicate that CO2 formation occurs over quartz reactor, i.e., in the absence of the catalysts. With Silica gel 60 catalyst, CH4 conversion and CO formation rates are shown later (Figs. 4 and 5 ). The CO formation is smaller than over ADM silica at low concentration of O2 (3–14%), its activity being nearly the same as quartz reactor only (Figs. 4 and 5). With A300 catalyst, CO, CO2, H2 and CH3OH formations were not observed at low O2 concentrations (3–14%), being the same as those in the absence of catalysts. The A300 catalyst exhibited low activity in the partial oxidation of CH4 although the figures are not shown. Table 1 shows that ADM silica contains some impurities of Al2O3 and CaO. On the contrary, Silica gel 60 contains little or no impurities. A300 silica contains some impurities but their amounts are not larger than those in ADM silica. Thus, high activities with ADM silica seem to be originated from the presence of Al2O3 or CaO. It is interesting that the activities are not depending on the surface area of these silicas. Catalysts containing 0.1–0.5wt% of CaO on Silica gel 60 were prepared and the CH4 oxidations were examined. These CaO/silicas did not exhibit high activities and their activities were the same as those of Silica gel 60 although the figures are not shown here. Thus, it is concluded that the high activity of ADM silica comes from the presence of Al ions. 3.2 Partial oxidation of CH4 over Al/silica catalysts It is concluded that impurities of Al oxide in silica play an important role for the partial oxidation of CH4 as described in Section 3.1. In this section, we attempted oxidation of CH4 over the prepared Al/silica catalysts that contain 0.05–1.0wt% of alumina in extra pure Silica gel 60. The 0.1–0.5wt% catalysts show higher activities than Silica gel 60 and quartz reactor (Fig. 4). The conversions increase with the increase of O2%, i.e., O2/(O2 +CH4). The catalysts exhibit nearly zero conversion at zero O2%. The activities of Al2O3 1.0 and 0.05wt% catalysts were lower than those over 0.1–0.5wt% catalysts though the figures are not shown here. Fig. 5 shows the results of CO formations. The rates increase with O2 concentrations. The CO formation rates are at the same level as those over ADM silica. The selectivities to CO are ca. 70% at a reaction time of 18s and ca. 60% at 5.5s (Fig. 6 ). The selectivities to CO2 range from 0% to 20% and they are smaller at a short reaction time of 5.5s (Fig. 7 ). Fig. 8 shows that the selectivity to HCHO ranges from 7% to 2% with the increase of O2% from 3% to 50% at a reaction time of 5.5s. Those to CH3OH range from 1% to 3.5%, its rate increasing with the increase of O2/(O2 +CH4). The selectivity to C2H6 ranges from 15% to 11% at a reaction time 5.5s (Table 3 ). These selectivities are the highest among the partial oxidation products. The C2H4 formation shows a reverse tendency of C2H6 formation. The H2 selectivities are calculated by hydrogen balance and the results are shown in Table 3. The H2 selectivities are similar to those of C2H6. Its selectivity decreases with the increase of O2/(O2 +CH4). H2 seems to be produced with C2H6 formations. H2 formation may occur on acid sites by cracking CH4 since the amounts of H2 are more than those of C2H6. As described above, 0.1wt% Al2O3/silica catalyst prepared from Silica gel 60 exhibited higher selectivities to C2H6, H2, and HCHO at low O2 concentrations. The selectivities over 1.0wt% Al2O3/silica were nearly the same over 0.1wt% Al2O3/silica catalysts except more CO2 formation. The selectivities over 0.05wt% Al2O3/silica were also similar to those over 0.1wt% Al2O3/silica catalyst. But it exhibited little or no formation of CO2 and C2H4 at low oxygen concentrations. Thus, there was a little difference present among 1–0.05wt% Al2O3/silica catalysts. 3.3 Characterization of Al ions on Silica gel by MAS NMR According to Kirkpatrik et al., resonance spectra of 27Al were obtained at +50 to +80ppm for Al(4) and at −10 to +20ppm for Al(6) [27]. Theγ-Al2O3 exhibits peaks at 68.1 and 8.7ppm [28], as shown in Fig. 9 . Al(4) means tetrahedrally coordinated state and the Al(6) means octahedrally coordinated one. Their area ratio of peak area for γ-Al2O3 is determined as Al(6)/Al(4)=1.9/1 (Table 4 ), which is the value of imperfect spinel γ-Al2O3 structure. The spectra of α-Al2O3 was reported one peak of ca. 5ppm, which is attributed to Al(6) ions although the spectra was not shown [28]. Fig. 10 shows the MAS NMR spectra of 0.1 and 1.0wt% Al2O3/silica catalysts, respectively. The chemical shifts of Al(4) ions including 0.5wt% Al2O3/silica catalyst are 54, 50 and 45ppm (Table 4). They increase to higher magnetic fields with the decrease of Al contents. With Al(4) species, some workers reported that chemical shifts depended on the Al/Si ratio of compounds. The shifts decrease with the decrease of Al ions in Al–Si oxide compounds [28,29]. The change of chemical shifts in this work seems to come from some shielding and from isolation of Al ions. The catalysts containing 0.1–0.5wt% of Al2O3 should have both Al(4) and Al(6) ions in silica and the former should have Lewis acid characters due to dehydration at high temperatures such as 650°C. NMR intensity ratio of Al(6)/Al(4) is larger with 1.0wt% Al2O3/silica catalyst, which is different from 0.1wt% catalyst sample. This suggests that 1.0wt% catalyst contains some Al oxide on silica containing both Al(6) and Al(4) species. Consequently, isolated Al(4) species will be decreased. The amount of Al(4) species with 0.05wt% Al2O3 seems to become less than 0.1–0.5wt% catalysts due to decrease of Al concentrations. 3.4 Discussion with the reaction mechanism It is well known that the process occurs on wall effects in homogeneous processes [2]. Partial oxidation reaction is initiated by methyl radical formation. It is reported that methyl radicals are also formed by O2 [2]. CH4 +M→CH3 +H +M CH4 +O2 →CH3 +HO2 In this study, the presence of Al/silica catalyst and O2 are needed to facilitate reactions as described in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. Al/silica C H 4 + O 2 * ⟶ Al / silica C H 3 + H O 2 In this work, O2* seems to be produced on around Al ions, i.e., Lewis acid sites. This may come from the characters of electron donating (O2) and accepting (Al ions). It is likely to be a kind of adsorption since O2* will never change to O2 +. O2* will have the same radical characters as gaseous O2. It will be a heterogeneous step in the homogeneous reactions. Such Lewis acid sites may be present more over 0.1–0.5wt% Al2O3/silica than over other catalysts as described in Section 3.3. Ethane will be formed in the following steps. H2 will be formed at the same time. 2CH3 →C2H6 2H →H2 Ethane selectivities decreased with the increase of reaction time, but H2 selectivities did not vary so much with the change of reaction time (Table 3). Ethane seems to be dehydrogenated with accompanying H2 formation. Ethylene seems to be formed in two ways. The possibility of dehydrogenation by lattice oxygen will not be excluded as described below. C2H6 →C2H5 +H C2H5 →C2H4 +H C2H6 +(O)→C2H4 +H2O Products CO and HCHO will be produced via CH3OO as described below. The step will also be facilitated by the presence of O2* as the concentration of the radicals increase on around Al ions. Kobayashi [10] has reported that the selectivity to HCHO in the CH4 oxidation is high over low Fe/silica catalyst, i.e., over isolated Fe species. Similar reactions may take place here. CH3 +O2 →CH3OO →→CH3O →HCHO→CO CH3 +O2*→CH3OO →→CH3O →HCHO→CO Little amounts of methanol are produced in this study. Methanol will be produced via following steps in the homogeneous process as reported previously [2]. CH3O +CH4 →CH3OH+CH3 CH3O +H →CH3OH CH3 +OH →CH3OH One of CH3OH processes described above is hydrogen abstraction of CH3O from CH4. Zhang et al. [7] have got high CH3OH selectivities (−60%) at high pressures and high CH4 concentrations using quartz reactor. The process should occur in their cases. However, it will be difficult in this case because of low pressure and low concentration of CH4. Furthermore, CH3OH should be oxidized to CO and CO2 due to long reaction times. The third process described above will become possible if a large amount of OH are present as well as CH3 . Details will be a future subject. 4 Conclusions Partial oxidation of CH4 with O2 was carried out over a quartz reactor and in the presence of silica and Al doped silica catalysts. The partial oxidation of CH4 with molecular oxygen took place over all these conditions. Rates of CH4 conversions were enhanced by the presence of 0.1–0.5wt% alumina/silica even at low O2 concentrations. The products such as C2H6, C2H4, CH3OH, HCHO, CO and H2 were formed, which were nearly the same ones in homogeneous reactions. The products such as C2H6 and HCHO were formed with high selectivities of 15–10%. The states of Al ions by using MAS NMR were determined as tetrahedrally coordinated and isolated Al ions. These seem to facilitate O2* adsorptions due to Lewis acid characters. This species seem to enhance the partial oxidation products such as C2H6, HCHO and CO. References [1] R. Pichai K. Klier Catal.
