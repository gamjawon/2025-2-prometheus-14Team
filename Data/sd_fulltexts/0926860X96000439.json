Guin * Chemical Engineering Department, 230 Ross Hall, Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849, USA Received 2 October 1995: revised 16 January 1996; accepted 16 January 1996 Abstract This work investigated coke induced physical changes in pore geometry and intraparticle diffusivities of deactivated unimodal and bimodal catalysts withdrawn from a 4 ton/day direct coal liquefaction ebullated bed reactor. Porosimetry, surface area, equilibrium adsorption, and pore diffusivity measurements were performed on fresh, spent, and regenerated catalysts. Equilibrium adsorption experiments showed the loss in adsorption sites in the spent catalysts to be significantly greater than indicated by the decrease in overall BET surface areas. Pore diffusivity measurements performed using solute adsorption from a finite bath surrounding the catalyst particles yielded pore diffusivities two orders of magnitude lower than would be expected based on the measured average pore characteristics of the spent catalysts. This observation was postulated to result from a nonuniform radial distribution of coke deposits within the spent catalyst particles. A mathemati- cal diffusion model incorporating the nonuniform coke deposition aspect of the deactivation process was formulated and used to simulate experimental diffusional uptake experiments. The model yielded results in satisfactory agreement with experimental measurements and provided a reasonable rationalization for the low diffusivities in the spent catalysts using physically realistic parameter values.

Deactivation is caused by several phenomena among which are physical changes in the catalyst pore structure due to the deposition of carbonaceous and metallic deposits [1-6]. These deposits can lead to greatly decreased pore diffusion Corresponding author. Tel. (+ 1-334) 8442020, tax.

Guin /Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 15.3 174 coefficients and associated reductions in overall catalytic activity [1-8]. The prediction of intraparticle diffusivities in actual used catalysts is important for an estimation of catalyst effectiveness factors and resulting global reaction rates. This work investigates the nature and extent of changes in catalyst pore structure due to coke and metals deposition along with the associated effects on pore diffusion rates. Two catalysts, one unimodal and one bimodal, from a 4 ton/day direct coal liquefaction process were studied. Comparisons were made of fresh, spent and regenerated catalysts. A mathematical model was formulated and compared with experimental diffusion data. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials 2.1.1. Chemicals Quinoline (99 + %, Aldrich Chemical Company) and HPLC grade cyclohex- ane (99.9 + %, Fisher Scientific) were used as solute and solvent, respectively, in diffusion studies. Both were pretreated with 4A molecular sieves prior to use to remove impurities and water. 2.1.2. Catalysts Two NiMo/A1203 catalysts were used in this study. Criterion 324 catalyst, denoted as catalyst A, is a unimodal catalyst developed by Criterion Catalyst Company (formerly Shell). EXP-AO-60 catalyst, denoted as catalyst B, is a bimodal catalyst designed by Amoco. Both catalysts were utilized for direct coal liquefaction in an ebullated bed hydrotreater at the Wilsonville Coal Liquefac- tion Research and Development Facility, Wilsonville, AL, USA. Properties of the fresh catalysts are given in Table 1. Additional fresh catalyst properties are given later for comparison with spent and regenerated catalysts.

Yang, J.A. Guin /Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 153-174 155 were calcined at 673 K for 12 hours prior to use in diffusion experiments to remove moisture and adsorbed impurities. The spent catalyst samples were obtained from Run 261 performed at the Wilsonville Advanced Coal Liquefaction Research and Development Facility. Run 261 liquefied Illinois No. 6 Coal from the Burning Star Mine #2 at a feed rate of about 4 tons/day. The process was operated in the Close-Coupled Integrated Two Stage Liquefaction (CC-ITSL) mode with the primary purpose of the run being to achieve high distillate yields at high coal throughout rates and to test a new attrition resistant bimodal catalyst (catalyst B). The CC-ITSL mode of operation refers to the use of two sequential ebullated bed catalytic reactors directly coupled without any pressure let-down or deashing between reactors [9]. The spent catalyst samples were withdrawn from the first reactor and thus were exposed to raw coal, ash, and preasphaltenes/cresol insolubles(recycle solvent) in the reactor. Both catalysts were operated at about 2650 p.s.i. (1 p.s.i. = 6894.76 Pa) H2 pressure at a coal feed rate of 60 lbm mf (moisture free) coal/hr-ft3-cat with a 2/1 solvent/coal ratio. Catalyst B was operated at 694 K, and was withdrawn at a catalyst age of 1375 Ibm mf coal/Ibm-cat. Catalyst A was operated at a slightly higher temperature of 705 K and was withdrawn at an age of 884 lbm mf coal/Ibm-cat. A detailed log of operations is contained in the pertinent technical report [10]. The spent catalysts were Soxhlet extracted with THF (tetrahydrofuran) for 9 days to remove residual liquids and were vacuum dried at 383 K for 24 hours. The remaining deposits, both carbonaceous and metallic, are lumped together as \"coke\" for the pur- poses of this work. Regenerated catalysts were prepared in the laboratory using air as the coke burnoff gas. The regeneration temperature program was: 4 h at 503 K, 4 h at 573 K, 14 h at 673 K, and 30 h at 773 K, during which the ratio of air flow to catalyst volume was 1000 sccm/cm3-cat. The fresh, spent and regenerated catalyst samples were stored in sealed bottles under nitrogen atmosphere in a desiccator until used. 2.2. Apparatus and procedures 2.2.1. Catalyst properties Catalyst pore volume, particle density and porosity were measured by pyc- nometry. Catalyst surface area was determined by the single point BET method using N2. Pore size distribution was determined by Hg porosimetry to 60 000 p.s.i. 2.2.2. Equilibrium adsorption isotherms Equilibrium adsorption experiments were performed to measure solute (quinoline) uptakes of catalysts at different concentrations. Solutions of 25 cm3 of quinoline in cyclohexane at various concentrations were placed in bottles 156 X. Yang, J.A. Guin / Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 153-174 containing -45 /~m (-325 mesh) weighed catalyst particles. The bottles were placed in an environmental shaker at 303 K for 10 to 14 days until equilibrium was attained. Quinoline concentration was determined by UV spectrophotometry at 274 nm. 2.2.3. Diffusion experiments Effective pore diffusion coefficients were determined using the uptake of solute (quinoline) from a finite bath surrounding the catalyst pellets. This basic technique has been used by a number of investigators [1,4-6]. In some experi- ments, catalyst extrudates were crushed or broken in order to obtain particles of different radii. For these particles, effective radii were taken as the geometric mean of adjacent screen openings. For the whole cylindrical pellets, effective spherical radii were calculated as 3 times the ratio of pellet volume to external surface area [11]. Diffusion experiments were performed in a magnetically stirred glass diffusion cell containing a screen wire basket for holding catalyst particles at 303 K [1]. Catalyst samples were presaturated with cyclohexane before diffusion runs, during which the uptake of quinoline was monitored periodically by UV spectrophotometry at 274 nm. In general terms, the solute uptake rate depends on the intrapore diffusivity and the equilibrium adsorption isotherm. 3. Diffusion model A mathematical model was utilized to obtain the effective diffusivity in the catalyst particles. The porous catalyst particles were immersed in a finite well-stirred bath containing sotute and solvent. Solute molecules diffuse into the porous particle where they are adsorbed onto the solid catalyst surface. As a result of this diffusion-adsorption process, the concentration of solute in the surrounding bath is depleted. The diffusion parameters in the model can be determined by fitting a mathematical model to the experimentally observed solute uptake curves. Generally, in studies of this type, catalyst properties are considered to be uniform throughout the catalyst particle. However, in the model developed here, it is assumed that the values of porosity and pore size in a catalyst particle may be functions of radial position. This assumption, motivated by experimental results to be discussed later, results in an effective diffusivity which is also a function of radial position inside the catalyst particle. Thus, the model presented here is somewhat more general than previously used models which assumed constant average values for catalyst properties and a resulting constant effective diffusivity [1-7]. The model developed in this study also assumes negligible solute transport by surface diffusion, spherical catalyst particle geometry, negli- gible external fluid solid mass transfer resistance, and local adsorption equilib- X. Yang, J.A. Guin /Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 153-174 157 rium inside the particle pores. While most of these assumptions are generally valid in system of this type, they were nevertheless examined in a series of preliminary experiments. The error involved in modeling the cylindrical extru- dates as equivalent spheres is only around 5%, providing an appropriate length scale (radius of equivalent sphere) based on the ratio of particle volume to external surface area is used [11]. The model also incorporates hindrance effects present when the catalyst pore size approaches the size of the diffusing solute molecule. Based on the above assumptions, the following mathematical model can be derived. The mass balance for the solute in the porous particle is: cg(KpEC) O(ppq) 10(20C) -q- .... r De-~-r (1) Ot Ot r2 Or with initial and boundary conditions: cl,-0 = o (2) r=R OC Or r=0=0' CIr=R=fb(t). (3) A material balance for the solute in the bath yields: d(VbCb) _47rR2k(D~OC] dt = -~r }It=R (4) with the initial condition: Cbl,-0 = Cbi. (5) In above equations, De is the effective pore diffusivity expressed by e Kp Kr De = --DAB (6) Z in which Kp and Kr factors are hindered diffusion parameters due to steric and hydrodynamic factors, respectively [12]. These two hindrance factors were estimated by the following two expressions derived for spherical solutes diffus- ing in cylindrical pores [12] Kp = (1 - A)2 (7) Kr = 1 - 2.104A + 2.089A3 - 0.948A5. (8) Other mathematical expressions [12,13] have been developed for these factors, however, they give essentially the same numerical values as Eqs. (7) and (8). A unique aspect of the model developed here is that these hindrance factors are evaluated locally as a function of radial position inside the catalyst particle. By defining the following dimensionless variables, the above equations can be 158 X. Yang, J.A. Guin /Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 153-174 put into dimensionless form, where the \"0\" subscript denotes properties of the fresh catalyst used as a reference state. r Deo % C Cb q t*- t, 0=--, 0b=--, Oq=- (9) ~:= R' Kpoe[oR2 T Cbi Cbi qi Kp E Kp Kr e Pp qi Vb Pp gl-------, g2-- , E- , F- Kpo eo Kpo Kro e0 Kpo e0Cbi We Kp0 ~50 Use of these variables gives the dimensionless diffusion model as 8(0q) --+E-- c)t * 0It*=0 =0 ~:<1 dOu Ot* (lO) (11) (12) --o, 01 =1-- (13) 11 dt* F gz (14) 1 1. (15) As noted above, the model presented here is somewhat more general than previously used models in that it allows for a nonuniform catalyst pore structure in which the local porosity and pore diameter can be functions of radial position inside the catalyst particle. This radial dependence of catalyst properties appears in the local hindrance functions g l and g2, which reflect the local degree of diffusive hindrance caused by pore clogging due to deposits in the pore structure. For a fresh catalyst particle, gl = g2-~ 1. For a spent, but uniform catalyst particle, g~ and g2 are constants, however, with values less than 1. For a nonuniform catalyst particle, g l and g2 are functions of radial position inside the particle. In the case of a nonuniform particle, the local pore diffusivity at any radial position in the particle is given by g2% De = --De0. (16) r The local diffusivity De can be significantly reduced from the fresh catalyst value Deo by the local value of g2 which reflects the hindrance effects due to local reduction in pore diameter caused by coke deposition. In the model developed here, the tortuosity factor r is considered as a constant average value, independent of radial position, although values of r for the spent and regenerated catalysts will generally differ from the value ro for the fresh catalyst.

(18) Ot* Ot* ~- O~ ge ~ 2 Using experimental parameters E, F, n, and local expressions for gl and ge, the above equations were solved numerically using the Method of Lines and subprogram IVPRK in the IMSL mathematics package [14]. Comparing the numerical solution with experimental data allows the effects of catalyst deposits on diffusion parameters to be ascertained. The accuracy of the numerical solution was verified by comparing with several available solutions, including an analytical solution with linear adsorp- tion [15], approximate analytical [16] and numerical [17] solutions with negligi- ble pore accumulation, and an numerical solution with constant adsorption for negligible bath concentration change [18]. A mass balance was also performed during the numerical solution at various times to confirm that the amount of solute in the overall system was constant. 4. Results and discussion 4.1.

As shown in Fig. 1, the major difference in fresh catalysts A and B is the presence of macropores and micropores in B, giving rise to a bimodal pore size distribution as compared to unimodal A. The presence of macroporosity in fresh bimodal catalyst B is apparent, as reflected in its lower particle density and higher pore volume, as well as the fact that B has about double the pore volume of A. On the other hand, the presence of smaller micropores in catalyst B as compared to catalyst A is reflected in its higher surface area, as shown in Table 2. The lower density of a bimodal catalyst such as catalyst B is usually reflected in a lower crush strength, while the greater pore volume and surface area are expected to give rise to higher activity and deposit capacity. Apparent from Fig. 2 is the fact that the regenerated catalysts have the same pore size distribution as the fresh catalysts, except for the region of micropores in catalyst B which appears to be unrecovered in the regenerated 0.8 4 6 0.6 0.4 5 0.2 0.0 .......................

Fig. 2 also shows the dramatic loss of pore volume due to coke deposition in the spent catalysts. From Table 2 it can be seen that due to deposits in the catalyst pores during the coal liquefaction process, the particle densities increased by 40% and 33% for catalysts A and B, respectively, and the associated pore volumes decreased by 70% and 61%, respectively. Upon regeneration by controlled oxidation, the surface area for catalyst A recovered nearly to that of fresh catalyst(90%), but the percent restoration for catalyst B, 79%, was not as large. This is probably associated with the loss of micropores in catalyst B, as shown in Fig. 2. On the other hand, for both catalysts, the volumetric properties of particle density, pore volume and porosity were restored nearly to those of fresh catalysts. The high percent recovery of volumetric properties such as particle density and pore volume shown in Table 2 indicates that deposits in these direct coal liquefaction catalysts are primarily carbonaceous, rather than metallic. As measured by weight loss of the spent catalysts upon regeneration, organic deposits in both catalysts A and B were more than 20 wt% of the spent samples. This observation is in contrast to the situation typically observed in deactivated petroleum resid catalysts, where deposits contain a high percentage of metals, primarily V and Ni. For example, Johnson et al [5] found the deposits of V and Ni metal sulfides in resid deactivated CoMo/A1203 HDS catalysts to be greater than 20 wt% of the spent catalyst, whereas organic deposits were less than 15 wt%. One should also note from Table 2 that the average pore diameters Dp for both spent catalysts A and B were decreased by 41%. It will be seen later that these percentage decreases are not commensurate with the much greater de- creases observed in the effective diffusivities. The estimated average pore sizes for the regenerated catalysts were slightly larger than those for fresh catalysts, as shown in Table 2. This is probably a result of the averaging process, especially for the bimodal catalyst in which the pore size is an average of the micropores and macropores, considering the fact that a major loss of pore volume of the bimodal catalyst was in the micropore region, as shown in Fig. 2. 4.2. Equilibrium adsorption isotherms The equilibrium adsorption of solute on the catalyst surface, q~, was obtained from the following mass balance equation, Vb (1 - Kp)~Cbe qe = .~'7(Cbi- Cbe) q- (19) We Pp The second term on the right side of Eq. (19) accounts for the solute in the catalyst pore fluid with the exclusion factor Kp estimated from Eq. (7). This term was generally less than 1% of the right hand side due to the strong 162 X.

The equilibrium adsorption data were fitted by the Freundlich adsorption isotherms according to Eq. (17). Fig. 3 shows the isotherms for the adsorption of quinoline from cyclohexane with fresh, spent and regenerated catalysts, and Table 3 gives the corresponding Freundlich isotherm parameters m and n for these catalysts. The Freundlich equation yields a satisfactory fit of the equilibrium data. As shown in Fig. 3, presumably due to deposits on the spent catalysts, the adsorption capacities of these samples were less than 20% of those for the fresh catalysts. The regeneration procedures only partially restored the adsorption capacities. Fig. 4 shows the same adsorption data on a per unit surface area basis for the fresh, spent and regenerated catalysts. It is observed that the loss in adsorption capacity is significantly greater than would be expected based on the corresponding loss in total BET surface area. Considering the basic nature of the quinoline adsorbate, these results indicate a preferential loss of catalyst active Table 3 Freundlich isotherm parameters tbr quinoline in cyclohexane with fresh, spent and regenerated catalysts Catalyst m n Catalyst A Fresh 52.4 7.03 Spent 13.6 3.16 Regenerated 35.1 6.03 Catalyst B Fresh 59.4 7.25 Spent 22.1 3.90 Regenerated 47.9 4.89 X.

Diffusion experiments and effective diffusivities from uniform particle model To verify the experimental apparatus and validity of model assumptions, uptake experiments were performed using several catalyst particle sizes obtained by crushing a fresh Shell 324 NiMo/AI203 unimodal catalyst. Particle radii were 0.08, 0.055, 0.039 and 0.018 cm, as estimated from the geometric mean of upper and lower sieve openings. Shell 324 is essentially the same catalyst as Criterion (formerly Shell) 324 [10]; however, the particular sample used in these preliminary experiments was from a different batch than catalyst A in Tables 2 and 3 and had slightly different properties, viz., Vp = 0.50 cm3, S = 162 mZ/g, Freundlich parameters: m = 54.3, n = 8.5. Adsorptive uptake results from these preliminary experiments are shown in Fig. 5 as dimensionless bath concentration Cb/Cbi VS. time. The mathematical model fits all experimental data for four different particle sizes, with an error of less than 10%. The effect of various particle sizes on the quinoline uptake rate is reflected in the dimensionless time t *, as shown by the second expression in Eq. (9). This expression shows that the slope of a ln-ln plot of t*,/t vs. R should be -2 providing the model assumptions are valid. When the data for the four particle sizes are plotted as shown in Fig. 6, a least square slope of -1.97 is obtained. This value, being very close to -2, supports the assumptions made in the model development and indicates that the adsorption-diffusion process is controlled by intrapore diffu- sion at a rate inversely proportional to R2 in accordance with theory and model assumptions. Fig. 7 plots dimensionless time t * vs. t/R2 for different catalyst particle sizes. According to Eq. (9), a plot of dimensionless time t* vs. t/R2 164 X. Yang, J.A.

Thus Fig. 7 supports the assumption involving the neglect of external mass transfer as a controlling mechanism. For a diffusion controlled process without external mass transfer effects, the effective pore diffusivity should be the same regardless of differences in catalyst particle sizes. The effective diffusivity determined from the slope of Fig. 7 using experimental data for all particle sizes is (3.0_+ 0.2)10-6 cm2/s. These results indicate the model satisfactorily fits experimental data with different particle sizes, and serves to Fig. 6.

In particular, the effective diffusivity is independent of the particle size in keeping with model assumptions, and the overall adsorption-diffusion uptake process is controlled by intrapore diffusion. Following the above preliminary tests, diffusion experiments with fresh, spent(both extrudates and crushed particles) and regenerated catalysts were performed. Figs. 8 and 9 show two sets of typical data for uptakes of quinoline in the surrounding bath as a function of time, together with the curves fitted from the model solutions for fresh, spent and regenerated catalysts.

Guin / Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 153-174 167 cyclohexane was estimated from the Wilke-Chang equation as 1.16 l0-5 o cm2/s. The critical diameter of quinoline was calculated as 6.9 A, based on bond lengths, bond angles and atomic radii of the molecular structure. Restric- tive diffusion factors Kp and Kr were estimated by Eqs. (7) and (8), respec- tively, based on the critical diameter of quinoline and the average pore diameter for each catalyst in Table 2. These calculations gave values of A ranging from 0.045 to 0.094, and corresponding values of Kp and Kr from 0.82 to 0.91 and 0.80 to 0.91 for catalyst A and B, respectively. Thus hindrance effects for quinoline as based on the uniform properties model with an average pore diameter are not extremely large, although the product KpKr in Eq. (6) does lower the effective diffusivity by a factor of almost 50%. Table 4 shows that the effective diffusivity for fresh bimodal catalyst B is higher than that for fresh unimodal catalyst A, a fact which could significantly affect the catalyst activity for macromolecular (eg., asphaltene and preasphal- tene) reactions, such as occur in direct coal liquefaction. In addition, the calculated tortuosity for fresh catalyst B is smaller than that for fresh catalyst A. These results may be attributed to the more accessible bimodal pore size distribution for fresh catalyst B as compared to unimodal catalyst A. Thus, based on consideration of only fresh catalyst diffusivities, the bimodal catalyst would appear to offer possible advantages in a coal liquefaction process. Effective diffusivities for both A and B spent catalyst extrudates were extremely low as suggested by the extended time scale required in Figs. 8 and 9. As shown in Table 4, the actual diffusivity values were less than 1% of those for the fresh catalysts. Based on this observation it would seem that in the coal liquefaction process, a primary advantage evidenced by the fresh bimodal catalyst would not be fully maintained, although its diffusivity does remain an order of magnitude higher than that of the unimodal catalyst. As shown in Table 4, calculated tortuosity factors were of reasonable magnitudes for the fresh and regenerated catalysts; however, for spent catalysts A and B, calculated apparent tortuosities were 1080 and 116, respectively. These extremely high values are a direct consequence of the very low De values for the spent catalyst extrudates. Tortuosity values can be seen via models to result from pore constrictions and increased diffusional path length as compared to uniform pores [19,20], and while coke deposits may lead to some increase in tortuosity, values of this magnitude, i.e. 1080 and 116, are not physically realistic, as normally observed tortuosity values are in the range from 1 to 10 [21,22], and typically average around 3 to 4 [23]. The extremely high tortuosity values for the spent catalysts indicate that the uniform particle model does not satisfactorily model diffusion in the spent catalyst extrudates. Viewed in another way, the extremely low values of effective diffusivities for the spent catalyst extrudates are much lower than would be predicted by a uniform particle model using physically reasonable values of tortuosity. Based on these results, it was hypothesized that the very low spent catalyst diffusivities might be due to a nonuniform coke deposition in 168 X. Yang, J.A. Guin /Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 153-174 the spent catalysts, whereby the diffusivity at certain points in the catalyst particle, namely near the outer surface, was reduced to a much lower value than that calculated from Eq. (6) by using the constant Kp, Kr and E factors based on the average pore diameter as measured in Table 4. Thus it was postulated that a radially nonuniform coke deposition profile might account for the extremely low diffusivities and correspondingly high apparent tortuosities for the spent extrudates. To experimentally test for the presence of a nonuniform coke deposit, the spent catalyst extrudates were crushed to produce particles with radii of 0.016 cm, and additional uptake experiments were performed. The results with the crushed particles are also shown in Table 4 and Figs. 8 and 9. As shown by the preliminary experiments discussed earlier in Figs. 5-7 with fresh catalysts of varying particle sizes, when the properties of the catalyst particles are uniform, the values of effective diffusivity and tortuosity are independent of particle size. From Table 4 it can be seen that in the case of the spent catalysts, the calculated effective diffusivities for the crushed particles are much greater than for the extrudates. In addition, the data from the crushed particles yields more reason- able (lower) tortuosity factors as compared to the extrudates. These observations confirm the existence of nonuniform coke deposits in the spent extrudates. Higher diffusivities observed with crushed particles indicate that the interior of the extrudates is not as clogged by deposits as the outer region of the extrudates. The percentage increase in diffusivities obtained by crushing the extrudates is greater for catalyst A than for catalyst B, suggesting a more severely clogged outer pore region for the unimodal catalyst, possibly due to the lack of macroporous access channels as are present in bimodal catalyst B. Diffusion experiments were also performed with regenerated catalysts A and B. The model fitted effective diffusivities thus obtained are also shown in Table 4. The regeneration process significantly restores the effective diffusivities, by about two orders of magnitude, for both unimodal and bimodal catalysts, although not completely to the original levels for fresh catalysts. The percent effective diffusivity restoration for bimodal catalyst B (35%) is, however, greater than for unimodal catalyst A (17%). Thus even though the overall volumetric parameters were recovered by regeneration, the pore diffusivities were not completely recovered, possibly due to a small amount of metallic deposits near the outer particle surface, which is not evident in measurement of overall volumetric properties. The significant restoration of diffusivities in our experiments following oxidative regeneration can be contrasted with the results of Zhang et al. [2] who found very little restoration of diffusivities following regenerative oxidation alone. In this latter case, their results were found to be due partly to a mineral shell surrounding the catalyst particles which could not be removed by oxidation, but which could be removed by additional acid treatment. Following oxidation and acid treatment their diffusivities were com- pletely restored. In our case, the extremely low values of spent catalyst X. Yang, J.A. Guin / Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 153-174 169 diffusivities seem to be caused primarily by carbonaceous deposits in that they are significantly restored by oxidative regeneration alone. Furthermore, in contrast to the work of Zhang et al. [2], SEM micrographs of our spent and regenerated catalyst extrudates indicated the absence of any external shell surrounding the pellet exterior. However, examination of the spent catalysts by EDS (Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy) did show a small amount of metallic deposits, particularly Ti, Fe, Ca, near the outer surface of the particles. 4.4. A nonuniform particle model for spent catalyst extrudates As noted in the preceding section, the extremely low values of effective diffusivity for the spent extrudates, (or correspondingly high values of tortuos- ity), together with the higher diffusivities and more reasonable values for the tortuosities of the crushed particles indicated a nonuniform distribution of deposits in the extrudates. In the case of a nonuniform deposit distribution, the porosity, pore size, and other physical properties in the spent catalysts would be functions of radial position in the catalyst particle. With the above ideas in mind, an attempt to more realistically represent the diffusion behavior in spent catalyst extrudates was made by development of a model which included a nonuniform distribution of coke deposits. In a nonuni- form deposit model, the corresponding local coke deposit distribution along the particle radius is needed. Because the exact radial distribution of deposits in the spent catalyst is generally unknown, as was the case here, a postulated distribu- tion of deposits with adjustable parameters was assumed. In accord with the discussion for diffusion of the spent extrudates and crushed particles, it is apparent that the deposits are located increasingly near the surface of catalyst particles. For simplicity, it was assumed that the local porosity in the spent catalyst could be represented by a step function of the particle radius having three adjustable parameters, b, c and co, viz., _[ c,~<b (20) e0[ co, b ~< ~ ~< 1 \" A better physical understanding of the postulated deposit distribution may be obtained by referring to Fig. 10. In Eq. (20), parameter b locates the step, c and c0 are the ratios of E/E0 in the inner and outer regions of the particle, respectively. The values for b, c and co must be in the range 0 to 1, with c greater than co. We should emphasize here that the purpose of this deposit postulation is to provide a rational explanation for the observed diffusivities in the spent catalysts and that the actual deposit distribution is probably not the same as the simple step model assumed here. However, it is required, as shown in the following, that our postulated distribution of a/E0 conform to the experimentally measured macroscopic properties of the spent catalysts. 170 X. Yang, J.A.

Step model for nonuniform coke deposit profiles in spent catalysts (not to scale). In order to have physically realizable values of surface area, pore volume and tortuosity in the spent catalyst, the parameter values in the postulated e/e0 distribution are restricted to a fairly narrow range. By trial and error it was determined that allowable values of parameter b were around 0.75 for catalyst A and 0.90 for catalyst B. The other two deposit parameters, c and co were determined by matching the experimentally measured changes in two average properties of the spent extrudates, namely, specific surface area and pore volume, as compared to their values in the fresh extrudates.

The resulting deposit distributions are shown in Fig. 10. These distributions indicate that catalyst A is more severely clogged at the particle surface than catalyst B. X. Yang, J.A.

The resulting fit parameters for spent catalysts A and B extrudates with the nonuniform particle model are shown in Table 5. From Table 5 it can be seen that with the nonuniform particle model, the porosity e and hindrance factors Kp and Kr at catalyst particle exterior surface are decreased substan- tially as compared to the uniform particle model. These reduced hindrance factors at the particle surface are a consequence of the lower porosity and pore diameter near the outer particle surface as depicted by the porosity distribution in Fig. 10. The tortuosity factors r are now physically reasonable values of 4.1 and 3.7 for spent A and B respectively, as compared to the unrealistic values of 1080 and 116 obtained from the uniform particle model fit. These results show that by allowing for nonuniform coke deposition within the spent catalyst particles, a reasonable fit of the diffusional uptake data is possible, with physically realistic values of the parameters, including the tortuosity. The preceding results indicate that reliable estimates of pore diffusivities in spent catalyst extrudates can not be made a priori from experimentally measured 172 X. Yang, J.A. Guin /Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 153 174 average physical properties, e.g., pore volume, surface area, pore diameter, etc. without taking into account the possible nonuniformity of particle deposits. By adopting a model which allows for nonuniformity of coke deposition within the catalyst particle, a reasonable description of the intrapore diffusion process can be obtained. 5. Conclusion The pore volumes, porosities, surface areas and adsorption capacities for both spent unimodal and bimodal direct coal liquefaction catalysts were much less than those for the fresh catalysts. The equilibrium adsorption isotherms of quinoline in cyclohexane with fresh, spent and regenerated unimodal and bimodal catalysts were all nonlinear, and were well represented by the Fre- undlich isotherms. The loss in active sites during the coal liquefaction process, as indicated by reduced adsorption of the basic N compound quinoline, was much greater than would be estimated from the loss in BET surface area. Carbonaceous deposits, rather than metals, were the dominant factor causing a decrease in the effective diffusivity for the spent catalysts, and this decrease was much greater than would be estimated from the decrease in average pore diameter calculated based on surface area and pore volume of the spent catalysts. Regeneration by controlled oxidation of spent unimodal and bimodal catalysts significantly restored the effective diffusivities, although not com- pletely to the levels for the fresh catalysts, with the regeneration extent for the bimodal catalyst exceeding that of the unimodal catalyst. A diffusion model based on uniform particle properties satisfactorily fit the experimental data with both fresh catalysts, with the effective diffusivity for the bimodal catalyst being greater than that for the unimodal catalyst. The uniform particle model was not valid for spent catalyst extrudates as was evident from unrealistically high tortuosity factors. Experiments with crushed spent particles indicated a nonuniform coke deposit in both spent unimodal and bimodal catalyst extrudates. A diffusion model incorporating a nonuniform deposit distribution gave a satisfactory fit of the observed data for the spent catalyst extrudates, including reasonable tortuosity factors, and indicated that nonuni- formity of pore deposits should be considered when modeling intrapore diffu- sion in spent catalyst extrudates. 6.

This work investigated coke induced physical changes in pore geometry and intraparticle diffusivities of deactivated unimodal and bimodal catalysts withdrawn from a 4 ton/day direct coal liquefaction ebullated bed reactor. Porosimetry, surface area, equilibrium adsorption, and pore diffusivity measurements were performed on fresh, spent, and regenerated catalysts. Equilibrium adsorption experiments showed the loss in adsorption sites in the spent catalysts to be significantly greater than indicated by the decrease in overall BET surface areas. Pore diffusivity measurements performed using solute adsorption from a finite bath surrounding the catalyst particles yielded pore diffusivities two orders of magnitude lower than would be expected based on the measured average pore characteristics of the spent catalysts. This observation was postulated to result from a nonuniform radial distribution of coke deposits within the spent catalyst particles. A mathematical diffusion model incorporating the nonuniform coke deposition aspect of the deactivation process was formulated and used to simulate experimental diffusional uptake experiments. The model yielded results in satisfactory agreement with experimental measurements and provided a reasonable rationalization for the low diffusivities in the spent catalysts using physically realistic parameter values.

The model yielded results in satisfactory agreement with experimental measurements and provided a reasonable rationalization for the low diffusivities in the spent catalysts using physically realistic parameter values.",
