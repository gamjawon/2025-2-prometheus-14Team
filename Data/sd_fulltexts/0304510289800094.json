HALASZ, K. VARGA and P. FEJES Applied Chemistry Department, Jozsef Attila University, H-6720 Szeged (Hungary) Summary The selective ammoxidation of propene was studied over Sn02-Sb204 and promoted (B403, Ga^Os, 111203 and ^03) tin-antimony mixed oxide catalysts. Over binary tin-antimony oxides, the main products of the allyl type oxidation are acrylonitrile and acrolein, but doping with oxide pro- moters was found to influence the selectivity towards formation of special products. Over catalysts promoted with In^O^, 1,5-hexadiene and benzene are produced from two propene molecules chemisorbed on the same In3* center residing in the surface layer of the catalyst. The formation of 4- methylpent-2-enonitrile over catalysts doped with Bi203, Ga203 or Tl^Oy is explained by the ammoxidation of 4-methylpent-2-enyl carbenium ion produced by the interaction of a ir-allyl intermediate and an isopropyi carbenium ion formed on surface Bronsted acidic centers. Introduction Tin-antimony mixed oxides exhibit catalytic activity in selective oxi- dation and ammoxidation of 03-04 olefins [1-3]. In contrast to other selective oxidation catalysts, such as bismuth-molybdate [4] or uran- antimonate [5], active catalysts can be found over almost the whole compo- sition range [6,7]. Investigation of thermal behaviour of the tin-antimony mixed oxide system by derivatography [3, 8] showed neither exothermic nor endotherm- ic features. XRD measurements [3, 9] revealed that no new crystalline phase or compound formed in the binary oxide system. Mossbauer spectra [10,11] show the presence oftin(IV), antimony(V), and antimony(III) species in an oxygen environment. The coexistence of random arrays of such units is consistent with the thermal analytical and the XRD results, in that these catalysts can be described as a mixture of single oxides and a solid solution of antimony oxide in the tin(IV) oxide lattice with limited (~ 5%) concentration. Although modem spectroscopic techniques have been implemented for the investigation of tin-antimony mixed oxides, the identification of 0304-5102/89/$3.60 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 304 active sites has not yet been unambigous, because of the difficulties in determination of surface properties in this complicated system. However, changing the character of the base catalyst by addition of different pro- moters can be a useful indirect way to unravel the nature of surface active sites and to suggest possible reaction mechanisms. In the present work we have used this 'chemical' method, which is the determination of products formed in reactions taking place over the base and the promoted catalysts, in order to elucidate the mechanism of propene ammoxidation. The experimental procedure, the methods of preparation and inves- tigation of the catalysts and the catalytic measurements have been reported previously [3,12,13]. Results Catalytic properties of pure oxides The results obtained in the ammoxidation of propene over pure oxides in a pulse reactor at 673 K with a reactant composition of 7% C^tl^^ 7% NHa, 18% On and 68% N, are shown in Table 1. The single oxides display different behaviour with respect to activity (conversion) and selectivity for products. Propene reacts with high conversion over SnO; and ^303, but the acrylonitrile production is negligible. Over 8^04, Ga203 and ^303, which have rather low activities, the nitrogen of ammonia may be incorporated into a Tr-allyl type intermediate. Over In^O^ a substantial amount of 1,5- hexadiene and benzene can be produced, even in the presence of ammonia. Catalytic behaviour of the promoted catalysts Studies of the effect of the composition of tin-antimony mixed oxide in the propene ammoxidation [3,12] proved that the Sn:Sb =1:1 catalyst is the most effective in this reaction. Therefore, this oxide was used as base catalyst in the present work to study promotion effects. The experimental results are shown in Table 2, together with data of the base catalyst. Over catalysts promoted with Biz03, the conversion increases with growing additive concentration, while acrylonitrile selectivity decreases. Over these catalysts the formation of a dimerization product, 4-methylpent- 2-enonitrile (MPN) could be observed. It is produced in the presence of Gaa03 and Tl^O^ as well. On doping with Tl^O^ the acrylonitrile production is increased at low thallium concentrations. At higher promoter content, the selectivity undergoes a very rapid deterioration. Over tin-antimony mixed oxide promoted with ^03, reduced activity and selectivity towards acrylonitrile can be observed, but the oxidative dehydrodimerization and aromatization are enhanced to such a degree that 1,5-hexadiene and benzene constitute the main reaction products. 01 N <!f I 1 1 1 1 3 1 W ' Q m M w a C<1 10 ln.r-l 1 1 I '~1 I 1 1 1-1 1 1-1 1 'C 4-1 'S 0 '^, i-l <f CO 0 0 10 ^ r- o i-i i-i 10 no a) ^< CO CO a . ^3 '3 ^ 'S CO l0 10 >0 t~ T3 10 (N ^1 (M t~ 001-1 ' ^ S <s> S B ^ 1+3 0 0 8 t~ ^ t~ o 10 o a) i-l N (0 N 1 <r a a M 0 ^ u a bO 0^ '0 ce >>-4-3 >i g S '5 a -U O X; u '^5 w 3 ^ CM c~ r~r-i <0 1 1 CO 1 ^ '3 0 -S 0 3 a e 0 0 >-i0. a e 1^ 0 10 (0 10 0 t~ .2*4J 5& CO 10 0 00 0 CO <0 ^'i-l 5 0 3 -s *4->Sa I ^3 <t m?s ^0-MMCQO >S P 0.S &<a z ^<OOC~ <NC~00 C<IC~ TriOT-1 1 CT iri td ^ oi od 1 r^ T-< c~ (o ^ <u g N >n 1-1 r-i o 10 0 i i r-i w i i . o ro td 111 ^3 1 1 1 1 1 1-1 1-1 r-l 1 1 | s 0) '3 a x <v ft in ^i' ^r >o f >-i 10T l , i-i e<i 10 iii i\" ai IM' 111 01 i 'a ^3 '?> o ^'coi-i t~ooN ^'c-co riooo S <yi o>ooi-i coioo coioeo 100110 ca t- ^ ^<ro tOtO-^i Mi-ir-i f-^ii-i c \"3 '3 t- (Mr-lr-l t'OOlO COlOCO lOi-IO ' ^i u 0 CTOtO 00<0l0 OOIMr-1 (OTOi-1 4J pj 1-1 1-1 ni T3 'R w 0 s 3 's 5 5 S a OO-tflMNlOCO^\" C~0 0 S ^ oo c~ f- co t-' <d III co IM | A 9^ 0 & <u U T3 o > ^ a -^ B ^S4-3u (U 1) O3 o*0 U \"3 0) 0 10 10101N INC~CO ^000) <f CO CO cS IN ro (0 io ^<\" ro co r^ r-i csi \"^'11 4-' CO c <i) 0'& g i^ 1^ (N COi-ICM lOIMOt ^'C-IO (NC-tD 'a 0 hp 01 ^'O-* C~000 101000 000> 0 U - CO 10t0(0 COCON COCMl-1 ^'COr-1 o 3 'O B 0 0 -1 **3 r^ a. n) r-( a >-i +a ^^ o C 6? 11 4J a e u a a o5S XI 03G T-IIOO r-1100 r-<l00 r^lOO CQ r-t i-l r-l r-1 i ^3 5 4-1S3 01 M ^^ to w0 0 0 0 . ' S g ^ca o p 0.5 hce 307 Discussion On the basis of experimental data, mechanisms have been suggested to describe the oxidation reactions taking place over tin-antimony mixed oxides [3,13]. The steps (1) - (8), discussed in detail in [3], show best the characteristics of propene ammoxidation over the base catalyst system: CaHe + Sn^ + O2- > [Sn-- ^Hg]^ + [HO]- (1) [Sn-'-C^sl^+Sb^ ^[Sb-.-CaHsl^+Sn4-1- (2) [Sb-'-CaHgl^+O2- ^[Sb C3H4]3++[HO]- (3) [Sb C3H4]3++[NH]2-+202-+2Sb5+ > CH2=CH-CN+3Sb3++2[HO]- (4) NHa + 202- > [NH]2- + 2[HO]- Sb3-\" + Sn^ > Sb5-1- + Sn^ 2Sn2+ + O; > 2Sn4+ + 202- 2[OH]- >02- +H20 (5) (6) (7) (8) (In these equations, [Sn C3H5]3+ denotes a ir-allyl complex, [Sb\"-C3- H4]3+ a carbene intermediate and [OH]~ a surface hydroxyl center.) The main products of propene reaction over InzC^-promoted catalysts are 1,5-hexadiene and benzene, similarly to the pure oxide. To explain the formation of these products, the former mechanism must be considered, namely, that the formation of the carbene intermediate necessitates the transfer of two electrons. Moreover, these reactions may take place only if the transfer occurs in separate steps on two different metal ions (steps (1) and (3)) [14]. Consequently, metal ions which withdraw two electrons simultaneously are inactive in the formation of 0- or N-containing products. However, it is possible that two electrons may be transferred from two separate propene molecules chemisorbed on the same active center [15,16]. Following the electron transfer, the bonds to the metal ion are loosened and 1,5-hexadiene formed by the coupling of two adsorbed species. The hexa- diene may react further to give benzene. Over the catalysts promoted by Bi^O^, Ga^O^ and Ti^fis, another type of dimerization takes place, because in these cases a branched nitrile forms with only one double bond. The formation of MPN can be explained by the following steps: CH2=CH-CH3 + [OH]- > [CH3-CH-CH3] + O2- (9) 308 [CH3-CH-CH3] + [Sb- C3H4]3\"\" > f J\"3 1\" [CHa-CH-CH^CH-CH- SbJ + [OH]- (10) [ T3 r [CH3-CH-CH=CH-CH- SbJ + [NH]2- + 202- > CH3 CH3-CH-CH=CH-CN+Sb3++2[OH]- (11) In contrast to that of hexadiene, the formation of MPN cannot be described by the interaction of two allylic intermediates. In this scheme, step (9) shows the formation of an isopropyi carbenium ion, which takes place over surface Bronsted acidic sites of the promoter. The carbenium ion can interact with the carbene species to give a 4-methylpent-2-enyl carben- ium ion (step (10)). The further reaction of this dimer with the lattice oxy- gen and ammonia results in MPN (reaction (11)), in a manner similar to the formation of acrylonitrile. References 1 F. J. Berry, Adv.
