Where once this test was a tool for assessing the catalyst activity, it is now routinely used to predict the yields in commercial FCC units. However, the necessity of a thorough revision of this test is generally agreed upon to come up to its new requirements. To obtain data reflecting those observed in circulating riser pilot units, which provide the best smaller-scale simulation of commercial FCCU operation, a new MAT method was developed using an operating scenario quite different from those of the traditional ASTM-MAT test. Cracking of vacuum gas oil and heavy resid feeds over catalysts with quite different properties was performed with the ASTM-MAT technique, the modified MAT approach and in a riser pilot unit to evaluate the modified procedure. This paper shows that with the choice of appropriate experimental conditions for MAT, a good simulation of the riser pilot units can be obtained. It is demonstrated that the modified test eliminates the ranking reversals identified for the comparison of catalyst selectivities obtained by the ASTM-MAT and riser pilot units. Moreover the selectivity levels obtained by the modified MAT configuration are very close to riser data indicating similar reaction pathways in these very different reactor types. ~c' 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

To bridge the gap between laboratory testing and indus- trial units the use of circulating riser pilot units has provided the best small-scale simulation of commer- cial units [1]. However, these units require compara- tively high investment and are expensive to operate. This configuration is not suitable if a larger number of samples has to be examined, as required in catalyst development. For this reason MAT is very important for catalyst screening. 0926-860X/98/$19.00 ~ 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. Pll S0926-860X(97)00307-4 142 D. Wallenstein et al./Applied Catalysis A.\" General 167 (1998) 141-155 The MAT test is described by ASTM D-3907-80 as a tool to measure the activity of FCC catalysts. It can also be used to determine the selectivities of FCC catalysts [2,3], and for the kinetic analysis of cracking reactions. However, the commercial FCC process has seen dramatic changes such as the use of highly active catalysts, deteriorating feed qualities and shorter con- tact-times. Up to now the ASTM-MAT test itself has not been revised to adapt the method for today's commercial FCCU operation. Therefore several research groups have modified the ASTM method [4-8] resulting in many different test methods. How- ever, no MAT method has hitherto been published which affords similar catalyst ranking compared with riser units. On the contrary, it is often claimed that MAT will result in ranking discrepancies if different catalysts are compared [4,9-12]. We believe that the discrepancies reported are due to the inappropriate test conditions in the MAT test, such as the catalyst bed design, feed pre-heat, liquid and gas recovery, tem- perature and reaction time. Thus, the lack of a MAT method enabling a realistic judgement of catalyst performance emphasizes the need to revise the tradi- tional ASTM-MAT approach. The principal shortcomings of the ASTM technique are identified and given in the following: a catalyst contact-time of 75 s is not representative of commer- cial operation where contact-times between 2 and 10 s are employed. FCC catalysts are almost completely deactivated by coke formation after 12 s reaction time (see Fig. 1). This implies that all subsequent reactions take place on a deactivated catalyst which enhances the contribution of thermal reactions and non-selective matrix cracking to the overall reaction rate. Further- more the long contact-time gives more importance to secondary hydrogen transfer reactions, yielding an altered product distribution (less olefinic products). The reaction temperature in the MAT reactor is a further decisive determinant for the simulation of the reaction kinetics in riser reactors. Most research groups use temperatures far below the catalyst-to- oil mixing temperatures in riser reactors. An adequate feed vaporisation cannot be achieved by too low temperatures leading to restricted diffusion of feed molecules into the catalyst particles and capillary condensation of high boiling feed components [10]. Apart from the contact-time and temperature, the ASTM-MAT device is not satisfactorily designed for selectivity testing. The small volume of the collection system for liquid products (receiver) is considered to be the major drawback. Considerable amounts of the liquid products are lost and thus not analysed resulting in poor accuracy and precision. The temperature of the injected feed is poorly controlled entailing large scat- ter for thermal products. The manner of adjusting the operating severity also has an influence on catalyst ranking. The reaction severity has to be varied to obtain selectivity curves which enable the comparison of selectivities of dif- ferent activity catalysts.

However, this MAT approach ensures that selectivities are determined at different feed reaction times if catalysts of different activities are investigated. This results in artificial yield differences due to the so- called 'severity effects'. The dependence of olefin formation at constant conversion on reaction severity is illustrated in Fig. 3 which demonstrates that sever- ity effects might mask catalyst properties. The following modifications were implemented to overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings. A new receiver was developed to improve the recoveries of the liquid products. An annular, diluted catalyst bed was employed to achieve a better isothermicity and to improve feed vaporisation and feed dispersion.

The thermal conditions in the MAT reactor were adjusted to those in a pilot riser by rates of thermal cracking and hydrogen transfer, to ensure similar reaction patterns in the two techniques. The variation of reaction sever- ity was performed via catalyst quantity to reduce severity effects. A schematic representation of the modified MAT equipment is shown in Fig. 4. Apart from the method used to determine catalyst selectivities, the deactivation of the fresh catalysts plays a decisive role for catalyst evaluation as well. The cyclic propene steaming (CPS) procedure devel- oped by Grace Davison [13] was used for catalyst deactivation prior to MAT and riser testing. This technique affords a realistic deactivation of contami- nant metals and catalysts in multiple reduction/oxida- tion cycles in the presence of sulphur dioxide. All these modifications do not eliminate the funda- mental differences between the fixed catalyst bed in a MAT reactor and the continuous flow catalyst bed of pilot riser units. However the testing of metallated, CPS deactivated catalysts in the optimized micro- activity mode has been able to simulate the riser to such an extent that very similar catalyst ranking and similar selectivity levels are obtained. The ASTM-type MAT presently used at Grace Davison is performed as follows: catalytic activity and selectivity are determined using a fixed-bed reac- tor with reactor oven, oil injection system and product recovery system as described by ASTM D 3907-80. Variation of the catalyst-to-oil ratio between two and six is used to generate selectivity curves or yield curves depending on conversion. The catalyst mass is kept constant at 5 g. To ensure an even catalyst bed geometry and a steady dispersion and pre-heating of the oil before entering the catalyst bed, 4 g of glass beads of 0.2-0.3 mm diameter are used below and 6 g of glass beads above the catalyst bed. Experiments are carried out at a reactor temperature of 800 K and a catalyst time on stream of 30 s. For each MAT experiment, a new portion of the catalyst and glass beads are used. Before the cracking experiment is started, the reactor is equilibrated for at least 45 min in flowing nitrogen at the reaction tem- perature of 800 K. The feed is injected into a heated steel capillary (815 K). After passing through the cata- lyst bed the liquid products are collected in a receiver and a trap at a slightly negative pressure of -60 mbar. The gaseous products pass through the liquid products and are collected over water. Immediately upon com- pletion of feed addition (30 s), the nitrogen purge is started. The catalyst bed and liquid products are then stripped for 15 min with 500 ml nitrogen. During oil injection the liquid recovery system (see Fig. 4) is cooled with ice (receiver) and dry ice (trap) which is removed during the stripping phase to allow the liquid to warm up to room temperature. With this procedure, it is certain that no C ~-C4 hydrocarbons (below detec- tion limits) are retained in the liquid products. Alter the purge the weight of the liquid products is deter- mined and the gas volume and N2 purge volume is determined by the displacement of the water. D.

A mass balance is performed for each reac- tion run and the conversion is defined as the sum (wt.%) of C5 + gasoline, CrC4 gases, hydrogen and coke. The methods used for analysis of CI-C6 gases, liquid compounds, gasoline composition and coke on catalyst have been described in [14]. The approach used for the prediction of yields at constant conversion has also been described previously in detail by D. Wallenstein and U. Alkemade [14]. The characterisation data of the feeds employed in this study are given in Table 1. 2.3. Modifications 2.3.1. Product recoverT system The modified receiver has a volume of 150 ml and an internal tube cooled by air to 273 K during the cracking experiments (Fig. 4). A positive pressure is adjusted in the product recovery system to facilitate the precipitation of the mist in the receiver. 100 cracking experiments (20 selectivity curves, 5 different catalyst-to-oil ratios for each curve) with a commercially equilibrated catalyst and Feed A were performed using the ASTM receiver and the modified one to investigate the influence of the new receiver on liquid recoveries, catalyst selectivities and precision. 2.3.2.

ASTM-MAT catalyst bed was replaced by an annular bed (Fig. 5) to balance the omission of the feed pre- heat by the heated steel capillary used in the ASTM procedure. The configuration of the annular catalyst bed was realized by a glass core of 1 cm diameter and l0 cm length in the catalyst bed. The catalyst was diluted with glass beads (diameter: 0.2-0.3 ram) to a volume of l0 ml to keep the thermal mass constant. The distance between reactor wall and glass core was 2.5 mm. Temperature profiles in the middle of the catalyst bed were recorded during MAT runs to deter- mine the influence of the glass core and omission of feed pre-heat on temperature. 100 cracking experiments (20 selectivity curves, 5 different catalyst-to-oil ratios for each curve) using the ASTM method and the modified one were performed with a commercially equilibrated catalyst and Feed A to investigate the influence of the feed pre-heat mod- ification and the annular catalyst bed on yields and scatter of thermal products. A further aspect is the feed pre-heat by a glass bead layer above the catalyst bed used by some research groups [14,15]. To investigate the influence of the distribution of the inert particles in the catalyst bed MAT experiments were performed with two config- urations. In the first test series a glass bead layer of 6 g above the catalyst was used. In the second one the glass beads were mixed with the catalyst. A heavy paraffinic resid feedstock (Feed D) and a paraffinic vacuum gas oil (Feed B) with 5.1% and 0.53% Conradson carbon respectively were employed for MAT. 2.3.4. Reaction severity adjustment Selectivity curves are generated by plotting the yield of a given product versus the conversion. Varia- tion of the catalyst-to-oil ratio is used to obtain the different conversions. In the ASTM-type MAT test the catalyst mass is fixed at 5 g and the feed rate is varied. Consequently the selectivities of different activity catalysts are determined at different operational seve- rities. The effect of this severity variation on selectiv- ities are the so called severity effects and an attempt was made to quantify these severity effects. The dependency of selectivities on the catalyst-to-oil ratio obtained from about 50 MAT studies generated under identical experimental conditions were investigated by linear regression. In the modified approach the feed rate is kept constant at 1.5 g and the catalyst quantity is varied to ensure constant feed velocities in the reactor bed. The catalyst is always diluted with glass beads (dia- meter: 0.2-0.3 mm) to a volume of 10 ml to keep the thermal mass constant. Two catalysts of different activity referred to as Catalyst A and B were tested with Feed B in both methods. 2.3.5. Temperature Catalyst bed temperatures and feed injection times were modified to adjust the thermal conditions in the modified MAT reactor to those prevailing in a riser reactor via the rates of thermal cracking and hydrogen transfer. The following conditions were used: ASTM based MAT Modified MAT: Temperatures: Feed injection time Catalyst bed as described above 800 K, 833 K, 848 K 12s annular D.

Results and discussion 3.1. Product recovery system Recoveries, selectivities and precisions for the liquid products are summarised in Table 2. The receiver specified in the ASTM method did not afford a sufficient trapping of the liquid products mainly due to its limited volume of 50 ml. During the cracking experiments about 130 ml of crack gases and uncondensed liquid products are produced and about 13% of the liquid products are blown out and precipitated in the trap. The modified receiver increased the liquid recoveries from 87% to higher than 99%. The larger receiver volume, the internally cooled tube and the positive pressure substantially improved the precipitation of the mist in the receiver. The improved liquid recovery results in significantly reduced experimental scatter for all the liquid pro- ducts. On an average the relative precision of liquid products was improved by 50%. The higher gasoline yields and lower light cycle oil yields in the ASTM receiver are affected by the hypothetical assumption that only gasoline range compounds are lost by use of the ASTM receiver and collected in the trap. The mass of liquid products in the trap is not sufficient for GC analysis. Therefore the content of the trap is added to the gasoline fraction analysed for the receiver content. However, the find- ings suggest that the trap contains light cycle oil range compounds as well which leads to increasing gasoline Table 2 Influence of the different product recovery systems on yields and 2or errors at 60% conversion Product recovery system: ASTM Number of determinations: 88 New 8O Yields (wt%) relative 2or(%) Yields (wt%) relative 2o (%) Gasoline Light cycle oil Heavy cycle oil n-Pentane n-Hexane n-Heptane n-Octane n-Nonane Liquid recovery, receiver~ Liquid recovery, trapa Catalyst properties Deactivation A1203, wt% RE203, wt% V, ppm Ni, ppm Zeolite SA, m2/g Matrix SA, m2/g ucs, A 46 2.3 42.6 l.l 22 2.3 22.7 1.4 18 2.9 17.3 1.9 0.32 12 0.44 6 0.26 15 0.34 3 0.20 7 0.22 2 0.41 9 0.36 5 0.15 14 0.12 5 63% 77% 9.4% 0.6% Commercially (equilibrium catalyst) 44.3 1.1 3229 1015 204 40 24.26 a Percentage of feed. 148 D.

The dependency of yield levels on molecular weight observed for the selectivities of homologous com- pounds is demonstrated by the yields of n-paraffins. These shifts are due to the increasing losses of liquid products with decreasing molecular weight in the ASTM receiver. Consequently, the yields of light compounds are lower than the actual value. In con- trast, the estimate for heavier compounds are higher than the actual value. 3.2. Contact-time Selectivities obtained for 30 s and 12 s feed injec- tion time are summarised in Table 3.

The yields of C3 and C4 compounds, gasoline and olefins represent the contribution of secondary reactions to the overall reaction rate. Secondary cracking reactions of gasoline range compounds decreased resulting in higher gasoline yields and lower C3, Ca yields. The increased olefins mirror the reduced rate of the sec- ondary hydrogen transfer reactions. The lower light cycle oil and higher heavy cycle oil yields is attributable to the lower catalyst activity in the ASTM based MAT. After 12 s feed injection time the coke on catalyst has reached the saturation point (see Fig. 1) which means that in the ASTM-based MAT described in Section 2.2, 60% of the feed is contacted with a deactivated catalyst. Consequently less feed is converted after 12 s and the products have a higher heavy cycle oil concentration diluting the product in the receiver with unconverted products. 3.3. Feed pre-heat, catalyst bed Temperature profiles of different catalyst bed designs (Fig. 5) are displayed in Fig. 6. Comparison of corresponding experiments revealed that the change from the cylindrical catalyst bed to the annular catalyst bed has the most prominent effect on the catalyst bed temperature during the gas-oil cracking experiment.

The temperatures profiles in the annular catalyst bed demonstrate that this heat loss is neutralised to a large extent by the thermal mass of the glass core. A heated steel capillary (resistance heater) is used in the ASTM-MAT method for feed pre-heat. This config- uration was developed for the relatively long injection time of 75 s in the ASTM test and worked satisfacto- rily under these conditions. However, at shorter oil injection times the response of this system on tem- perature deviations from the target value is very slow. This is reflected by the omission of feed pre-heat with the electrically heated capillary which only causes a small temperature drop of 5 K. Moreover, this system turned out to be very imprecise. Visual inspection of the feed pre-heat controller at oil injection times of 12 s revealed temperature deviations ranging from 20 K to 100 K from the targeted value. Selectivities and 2~ errors are given in Table 4. A higher thermal cracking rate was observed in the cylindrical catalyst bed despite the 30 K lower tem- perature indicating a high contribution of thermal cracking in the electrically heated ASTM oil injection capillary. This is due to the temperature of the oil injection capillary walls which exceeds 1100 K when the controller of the oil injection capillary tries to adjust the targeted feed temperature by heating of the capillary. Moreover, the poorly controlled feed pre- heat by the ASTM device leads to an increased experimental scatter for C1, C2 compounds and coke. Some research groups use a glass bead layer above the catalyst bed for feed pre-heat. However, experi- mental findings suggested that some part of the Con- Table 4 Influence of feed pre-heat on yields and 2~r errors at 60% conversion radson carbon is filtered out of the feed by this layer of inert material above the catalyst bed resulting in an alteration of feed stock properties before it enters into the catalyst bed. With increasing Conradson carbon content of the feed an increasing coking of the glass bead layer above the catalyst bed occurred. Compar- ison of the coke selectivities obtained in reactors where glass beads and catalysts were mixed with the findings observed for the reactor bed with a glass bead layer above the catalyst exhibited the following shifts for the glass bead/catalyst blend: 36% higher coke levels on the catalysts were observed in case of the heavy resid feed (feed D) whereas the lighter vacuum gas oil (feed B) only supplied 16% higher coke formation. This indicates that the coke level difference between the two procedures depends on the amount of Conradson carbon content in feed and therefore bears out the filter theory. 3.4. Reaction severity adjustment The results of the severity effect analysis obtained by the linear regression of those MAT data determined with the ASTM catalyst-to-oil adjustment procedure are given in Table 5 and illustrated in Fig. 3 where the severity effect is exemplified by liquified petroleum gas (LPG) olefinicities. The observed severity effects on thermal, second- ary, and bimolecular reactions are supposed to be caused by the following reasons: 1. Temperature effect: A low catalyst-to-oil ratio means that the absolute mass of the feed is high leading to a stronger cooling effect due to the endothermic cracking reactions of the high feed mass. Moreover, the poor temperature control of the injected feed, discussed above, results in a Catalyst bed: ASTM, cylindrical Feed pre-heat: ASTM feed pre-heat Yields Annular No feed pre-heat relative 2~r (%) Yields, wt% Relative 2or (%) Number of determinations Coke, wt% C1+C2, wt% Catalyst properties: see Table 2 88 88 44 44 2.7 l0 2.2 5.5 1.3 l0 l.l 6.5 150 D.

Conse- quently, thermal reactions are reduced and the exothermic hydrogen transfer reactions are pro- moted at the low catalyst-to-oil ratios. 2. Residence time effect: At constant conversion the residence times of feed molecules are lower for catalysts of high activity due to the higher mass of feed which has to pass through the catalyst bed within the same time interval the feed of the low activity catalyst has to pass through. Products formed by the secondary reactions are favoured by longer residence times whereas the selectivities of primary unstable products such as gasoline decrease. 3. Concentration effects': A low catalyst-to-oil ratio corresponds to a large feed quantity. Consequently, the concentration of the feed molecules in a reactor bed of a high activity catalyst is higher than in a reactor bed of a low activity catalyst at constant conversion. The higher concentrations will favour bimolecular reactions such as hydrogen transfer. The severity effects summarised in Table 5 go along with these perceptions. C1 and C2 compounds are considered to be the typical thermal products and therefore develop faster with increasing temperatures and residence times at constant conversion. C3 and C4 compounds are end products of serial reactions and increase with longer residence times as well. Hydro- gen transfer involves exothermic, secondary, bimole- cular reactions, being favoured by high reactant concentrations and low temperatures. The hydrogen transfer reaction rate is mirrored by the LPG olefini- cities which significantly increase with reaction sever- ity. Gasoline is a primary unstable product in catalytic cracking and therefore decreases with increasing resi- dence times. Coke, and light cycle oil are not affected by severity effects. The findings obtained by the different catalyst-to- oil adjustment procedures are summarised in Table 6 where the key parameters responsible for severity effects (catalyst and oil quantities) and the selectivities having the strongest response on different reaction severities are summarised. Comparison of the catalyst- to-oil ratios at constant conversion reveals that the different approaches do not have a major impact on the reaction severity necessary to achieve a given conver- sion. The selectivities imply that the adjustment of the catalyst-to-oil ratio by catalyst quantity reduces sever- ity effects. In the modified approach the higher oper- ating severity is achieved by increasing the number of active centres at constant feed rate i.e. feed mass and feed residence times are constant. The selectivities are shifted to the same extent that can be expected from the data analysis given in Table 5. The severity effect even resulted in a reversed ranking for hydrogen selectivity. Apparently the variation of feed quantity is a strong determinant for severity effects. 3.5. Temperature The findings observed for the modified MAT reactor temperatures are compared with the corresponding DCR (Davison circulating riser [1]) data in Table 7. C1, C2 yields and LPG olefinicity are the key indicators for thermal conditions in a reactor. Com- parison of DCR data and MAT findings determined with the ASTM-type test reveals that the thermal cracking rate in the MAT is increased by 30%. This undesirable side effect is caused by the feed pre-heat in the oil injection capillary and the longer feed injection times discussed in Sections 3.2 and 3.3. This observation is confirmed by the LPG olefinicities. If the higher Cl and C2 yields were caused by the thermal conditions in the reactor, the MAT olefinicities should have to be higher as well. C~, C2 formation observed in the modified test at 800 K is 60% below the ASTM test yields despite the higher temperature in the annular catalyst bed, dis- cussed in Section 3.3. However, olefin levels now agree better with DCR levels. It can be concluded that the modification of the parameters contact-time, catalyst bed, feed pre-heat and temperature in fact D.

The response of the individual selectivities on raising temperatures from 800K to 833 K and 848 K is discussed below: CI, C2 yields and LPG olefinicity were shifted very close to DCR levels reflecting that the increas- ing temperature favours thermal cracking rates and suppresses exothermic hydrogen transfer reactions. 152 D. Wallenstein et al./Applied Catalysis A.\" General 167 (1998) 141-155 Coke yields obtained from vacuum gas oil cracking (Feed B) did not show large shifts. The coke formation observed in case of heavy resid feed (Feed C) cracking significantly decreased with increasing temperatures. These findings indicate that the cracking of large molecules is facilitated by temperature increase. 800 K appears to be sufficiently high to crack the heavy compounds of light gas oil feedstocks. How- ever, in the case of heavy resid feeds the reaction temperature of 800 K seems to be too low to prevent condensation reactions of large cyclic compounds in the catalyst pores which ultimately leads to higher coke yields. An interesting finding was the increasing heavy cycle oil yields and declining light cycle oil and gasoline formation at elevated temperatures. This is somewhat surprising because reaction rates generally increase with molecular weight. The observed lower reaction rate increase with increasing chain length and raising temperatures is due to the structure/reactivity relationship of the individual feed compounds [16]. The following order of reactivity is widely accepted: Aromatics with substituents greater than > naphthenes > paraffins > mono, polyaromatics Accordingly, light crackable feed compounds are already cracked at lower conversions, whereas the compounds relatively resistant against cracking reac- tions remain. The main feature in cracking of alkyl- aromatics is the great stability of the phenyl ring and the relative ease of chain removal by dealkylation. The findings suggest that there are mainly dealkylated polyaromatics in the conversion range where we investigated the influence of temperature. In this conversion range the temperature only has a minor influence on the reaction rate of dealkylated feed polyaromatics to LCO whereas the impact on second- ary reactions of LCO and gasoline range compounds is more prominent. 4. Applications- FCC catalyst ranking Several studies were performed using the DCR technique, the modified MAT approach and the ASTM type procedure. Catalysts with quite different proper- ties were chosen. Light vacuum gas oils and heavy resid feeds were used. These different reactants ensure a reasonable assessment with regard to the ranking of FCC selectivities obtained by the different methods. The optimized operation mode derived from Sec- tion 3 is given below and is used in the modified micro-activity approach: 12 s oil injection time, 833 K reaction temperature, new receiver, no feed pre-heat, annular catalyst bed, catalyst-to-oil ratio variation by catalyst quantity. Table 8 summarises the outcome of a study where the influence of different matrices on bottoms crack- ing and metals tolerance were investigated. The cat- alysts were co-impregnated to 3000ppm V and 2000ppm Ni and CPS deactivated. A paraffinic vacuum gas oil (Feed B) was used for selectivity testing. Both the DCR and the modified MAT identi- fied Catalyst B to have the best bottoms cracking capability. This classification was less pronounced in the ASTM-MAT which is attributed to the poorer feed vaporisation at 800 K. All methods identified Catalyst A to have the lowest activity. The ranking of Catalyst B and C was the same for the DCR and the modified MAT whereas the conversions measured with the ASTM-type MAT revealed a reversed order. Concerning the catalytic activity of contaminant metals the ASTM-type MAT showed Catalyst A to have the poorest performance and thus contradicted the DCR and the findings of the optimized MAT configuration where Catalyst B produced the highest hydrogen yields. The reversed ranking noted for hydrogen might be due to severity effects in the ASTM-type MAT. The similar adjustment of operat- ing severity in the DCR and modified MAT obviously affords similar ranking for this product. There are still differences in the absolute values for coke, hydrogen and olefin formation between the modified MAT approach and the DCR. However, the selectivities of the modified MAT approach show a significant shift in direction to the product slate obtained by DCR testing. In another study the ranking of three catalysts formulated with sieves of different unit cell sizes as well as different matrices were determined in the DCR and the modified MAT. Two sets of operating condi- tions, 800 K and 830 K were used for MAT. Again, the catalysts were metallated and CPS deactivated. A D.

However, DCR and MAT in the high reactor temperature mode (833 K) noted the highest activity for Catalyst D. Inspection of the selectivities did not reveal any ranking reversals besides for gasoline, caused by interpolation of DCR data in the overcracking regime.

The third study compares the performance of two matrix active catalysts versus a non-matrix active catalyst referred to as sample G, H and I respectively. The catalysts were deactivated under metals-free con- ditions at 816 K for 5 h in a 100% steam atmosphere [14]. A heavy aromatic resid feed (Feed C) is used for selectivity testing in the DCR, the ASTM type MAT test and the modified MAT. Here again, the ASTM-MAT could not confirm the large bottoms cracking differences observed in the DCR and the modified MAT. The DCR and modified MAT identified the non-matrix active catalyst to have inferior light cycle oil and heavy cycle oil yields whereas the ASTM test did not afford any significant bottoms cracking discrimination which we ascribe to the poor feed vaporisation. Again, the different rating of gasoline selectivities is due to interpolation of DCR data in the overcracking regime. 5. Conclusions The assessment of FCC catalyst performance by MAT depends to a certain extent on the operating scenario. A new method has been developed which avoids most of the shortcomings encountered with the traditional MAT and those methods published in many papers. The reliability and accuracy of MAT has been improved by shifting the thermal conditions in the catalyst bed and the catalyst time on stream towards commercial conditions as well as by simulation of the operating severity adjustment procedure used in circulating riser units. The good agreement of ranking and selectivity levels observed in the DCR versus MAT comparison studies is remark- able when one considers the fundamental differences between the time averaged product mixture of the MAT technique and the continuous flow product D. Wallenstein et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 167 (1998) 141-155 155 obtained by DCR testing. Evidently, the deactivation of metallated catalysts by several redox cycles in the presence of sulphur dioxide associated with the application of an appropriate micro-activity unit configuration and relevant test conditions provide a tool for catalyst evaluation comparable to riser pilot units.

The increasing demand for a quick and simple screening tool of FCC catalysts and feedstocks has propelled the well known micro-activity test (MAT) ASTM-D 3907-80 far beyond its original purpose. Where once this test was a tool for assessing the catalyst activity, it is now routinely used to predict the yields in commercial FCC units. However, the necessity of a thorough revision of this test is generally agreed upon to come up to its new requirements. To obtain data reflecting those observed in circulating riser pilot units, which provide the best smaller-scale simulation of commerical FCCU operation, a new MAT method was developed using an operating scenario quite different from those of the traditional ASTM-MAT test. Cracking of vacuum gas oil and heavy resid feeds over catalysts with quite different properties was performed with the ASTM-MAT technique, the modified MAT approach and in a riser pilot unit to evaluate the modified procedure. This paper shows that with the choice of appropriate experimental conditions for MAT, a good simulation of the riser pilot units can be obtained. It is demonstrated that the modified test eliminates the ranking reversals identified for the comparison of catalyst selectivities obtained by the ASTM-MAT and riser pilot units. Moreover the selectivity levels obtained by the modified MAT configuration are very close to riser data indicating similar reaction pathways in these very different reactor types.

        "dc:description": "The increasing demand for a quick and simple screening tool of FCC catalysts and feedstocks has propelled the well known micro-activity test (MAT) ASTM-D 3907-80 far beyond its original purpose. Where once this test was a tool for assessing the catalyst activity, it is now routinely used to predict the yields in commercial FCC units. However, the necessity of a thorough revision of this test is generally agreed upon to come up to its new requirements. To obtain data reflecting those observed in circulating riser pilot units, which provide the best smaller-scale simulation of commerical FCCU operation, a new MAT method was developed using an operating scenario quite different from those of the traditional ASTM-MAT test. Cracking of vacuum gas oil and heavy resid feeds over catalysts with quite different properties was performed with the ASTM-MAT technique, the modified MAT approach and in a riser pilot unit to evaluate the modified procedure. This paper shows that with the choice of appropriate experimental conditions for MAT, a good simulation of the riser pilot units can be obtained. It is demonstrated that the modified test eliminates the ranking reversals identified for the comparison of catalyst selectivities obtained by the ASTM-MAT and riser pilot units. Moreover the selectivity levels obtained by the modified MAT configuration are very close to riser data indicating similar reaction pathways in these very different reactor types.",
