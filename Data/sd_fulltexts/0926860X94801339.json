Introduction Many methods have been reported to obtain furoic acid among which the Cannizzaro reaction from furfural [ 1 ], oxidation of furfural using KMnO4 [2], MnO2 [3] or NaOC1 [4]. These reactions, carried out with a large amount of reagents generally higher than the stoichiometry, yield highly polluting effluents. The use of catalysts such as Ag20 [5], CuO/ Ag20 mixtures [6] or mixtures of metallic oxides such as iron, copper and noble metal oxides like platinum [ 7 ] has the small disadvantage of giving chemical oxidations. How- ever, these catalysts are easily poisoned and their regeneration appears to be quite delicate [8]. Up to now, the use of platinum on charcoal for this reaction has not been reported. We have found that furfural can be easily oxidized to furoic acid with oxygen in the presence of platinum on charcoal. Additionally, we have shown that the addition of a lead salt increases the catalytic activity of platinum drastically [9]. Investigation of different para- *Corresponding author. Tel.

Verdeguer et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 112 (1994) 1-11 meters of the reaction led to the proposition of mild operating conditions which can be scaled up to industrial application. The results obtained are taken into account in the proposed reaction scheme. 2. Experimental The furfural used was distilled before utilization and had a purity of 99%. An amount of 250 ml of an aqueous solution of furfural of the desired concentration and the necessary amount of catalyst were placed in a 350 ml flask, equipped with a condenser, a stirrer, an oxygen supply and a NaOH supply. At initial time (t= 0), oxygen was introduced at the desired flow-rate and the pH was controlled by a pH meter and regulated by adding a 2 M NaOH solution. At the end of the reaction, the crude oxidation mixture was filtered and the catalyst washed with 500 ml of hot water. The reaction mixture and the wash water of the catalyst were then analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). 2.1. Analysis An analytical method allowing the assay of furfural, furoic acid and furfuryl alcohol simultaneously was set up and samples were analyzed by HPLC under the following conditions: --Column: Bronlee Lab RP 8; 25 cm: 5 mm; 4.6 mm I.D. --Mobile phase: H20/AcOH (1%o): 70% --Acetonitrile: 30% --Flow-rate: 0.5 ml/min --Detection: UV: 260 nm. Para-methoxyacetophenone was used as internal standard. 3. Results 3.1. Choice of the reaction medium Preliminary investigation on solvent and metal showed that the formation of furoic acid is only observed in water and in the presence of a platinum catalyst [9]. Platinum is widely used for this type of reaction and the efficiency of the metal seems to be linked to the solvent/substrate couple [ 10]. Table 1 presents tests carried out with different types of platinum on charcoal. We found that catalytic activity increased with the specific surface of charcoal for a 5% platinum loading. Pt/CA catalyst from Engelhard was used for the rest of our study. Adding various compounds, in heterogenous catalysis, lead in some cases to increased performance of the catalyst [ 11 ]. Thus, sugars can be oxidized in an aqueous medium in the presence of noble metals catalysts; lead and bismuth in salt forms, oxides and hydroxides were often added as co-catalysts [ 12-14]. P.

Verdeguer et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 112 (1994) 1-11 Table 2 shows in the case of oxidation of furfural that bismuth has no effect whereas lead acetate produces a fourfold increase of the catalytic activity. Pb(OAc)2 was used as pro- moter for the rest of this study. Heyns and Paulsen [ 10] reported that oxidation of alcohols or aldehydes to acids must be carried out in an aqueous alkaline medium to neutralize the progressive formation of acid. In the case of furfural (Table 3), when the reaction is carried out without adjusting the pH value, it stops when the pH becomes too acid. Increasing the pH, by progressively adding NaOH, leads to an increase of catalytic activity. However, above pH 10, the selec- tivity decreases. Analysis of the reaction mixture reveals the presence of furfuryl alcohol, indicating that furfural is subjected to the Cannizzaro reaction. Previous tests had enabled us to establish the main components of the reaction medium. Thus catalytic oxidation of furfural must be carried out in an aqueous alkaline medium in the presence of lead/platinum on charcoal. 3.2. Effect of the main parameters of the reaction It is the intent of this work to present a better comprehension of the mechanism of this oxidation with particular emphasis on the role of each parameter. It then becomes possible to find the most suitable operating conditions to scale up the reaction. Results of Table 4 show that increasing the catalytic ratio is favourable for the conversion of furfural. However, above 2% the catalytic activity decreases, and further increasing the catalytic ratio is of no use. It seems that at high catalytic ratio (5%) the viscosity of the reaction medium increases, limiting the diffusion of the substrate to the catalytic sites. The increase of the amount of lead acetate raises the selectivity and the catalytic activity (Table 5). In the case of oxidation of gluconic acid into 2-ketogluconic acid, Smits et al. [15] used a lead/platinum atomic ratio between 0.2 and 0.5, but to our knowledge no general rule has been reported. Rising the temperature up to 65 lead to an increase of the catalytic activity, as is shown in Table 6. The increase of thermic agitation favours diffusion of furfural to active catalytic sites in the liquid phase. Nevertheless, it yields a decrease of oxygen solubility in water [ 16], Van Dam et al. [ 17] showed that decreasing the temperature from 80 to 20 results in an increase of the oxygen solubility by a factor of 1.8. In the case of furfural oxidation, at 75 selectivity decreases due to furfural losses by evaporation through the oxygen outlet tubing.

However, we are limited by the solubility of furfural in water. Table 7 shows a maximum catalytic activity for an initial concentration of furfural of 0.25 M. A series of tests were carried out for 5, 10, 20, 30 and 60 min reaction time. Results of these experiments are presented in Fig. 1. In terms of conversion of furfural to furoic acid the reaction was quantitative in 60 min. The rate of the reaction was higher at short reaction time and decreased rapidly. The catalytic activity decreased with furfural concentration as the reaction proceeded [9]. This clearly shows that it is better to keep the concentration of furfural constant in the reaction mixture in order to maintain a high catalytic activity.

In a discontinuous system, remarkable results are obtained. Conversely to catalysts used up to now to carry out this reaction [5-8], the lead/platinum on charcoal system is not subjected to deactivation even after a successive tenfold recycling of the catalytic charge (Table 8). Notice that lead acetate is added at the first cycle and the system does not require further addition of lead.

Mechanism Taking into account the results obtained during this study, it is now interesting to try to understand better the role of the different parameters. The role of platinum is explicitly explained by the dehydrogenation theory, proposed by Wieland [ 18-21 ], which seems the most adequate for this type of reaction. This author investigated oxidation of simple alcohols to aldehydes in a diluted aqueous medium in the presence of platinum and oxygen. He showed that replacement of oxygen by a hydrogen acceptor (methylene blue) resulted in dehydrogenation. Platinum activates geminal hydrogen of the group to be oxidized [22].

Proposition of a reaction mechanism for the oxidation of furfural to furoic acid in the presence of a catalytic Pb/Pt system. This activation leads to the formation of a catalyst/hydrogen complex which weakens the C-H bond. The catalyst attracts the negative charge of the hydride and oxygen, present in the medium, combines with the hydride to form a hydroxyl ion. The latter attacks the cationic substrate, hence justifying comparison with nucleophilic substitution [23] (Fig. 2). Recently, Sheldon [24] proposed this mechanism for oxidation of secondary alcohols. Fig. 3 shows the necessity, for oxidation of aldehydes, to introduce a hydrated form of the carbonyl group [ 17,25]. This explains why the oxidation of alcohol stops at the aldehyde P. Verdeguer et aL / Applied Catalysis A: General 112 (1994) 1-11 stage when the reaction is carried out in an organic medium [ 17]. Therefore, we now understand better that catalytic oxidation of furfural is only observed in water [9]. Even though utilization of a bi-metallic oxidation system like Pb/Pt has considerably expanded during these last years [26-35], the role of the co-catalyst has not been clearly elucidated. To our knowledge, two interpretations have been proposed. The first one concerns the role of bismuth in the oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid in the presence of a palladium/ bismuth system. Saito [33] associates high selectivity of this catalytic system with the formation of a Pd/Bi alloy which may be the active catalytic species. However, this is in contradiction with the work of Fuentes and Flbche [35] and more recently of Despeyroux et al. [ 36] who did not detect the formation of a Pd/Bi alloy by ESCA analysis. The second one concerns the oxidation of gluconic acid into 2-ketogluconic acid, Smits et al. [ 15,37] found that the Pb/Pt system is more selective than platinum. They assume that this high selectivity is due to formation of a gluconate/lead complex at the surface of the catalyst. Thus, lead allows the positioning of the substrate in a configuration which favours departure of the hydride at C2. For oxidation of furfural, lead probably acts on the adsorption step of this molecule to the surface of the catalyst. Being in an ionic form, Pb 2+ is softer than platinum which is essentially [37] present in a reduced form. We can therefore think of an interaction between lead and 7r electrons of the furanic ring rather than with oxygen electron pairs. So a contribution of furfural adsorption to the catalytic surface is an intermediate step, resulting in the formation of a \"Pb-furanic ring\" complex. Hence, addition of a water molecule (Fig. 4), in an aqueous medium, on the carbonyl groups results in the formation of a gem-diol. This latter adsorbs to the surface of the catalyst through ~- electrons of the ring and results in a cleavage giving furoic acid and the hydride ion. In a basic medium, desorption of furoate is favoured. Meanwhile, the hydride ion com- bines to form a hydroxyl ion and liberates the active catalytic site. 4. Conclusion Investigation on the main parameters of oxidation of furfural to furoic acid in the presence of oxygen and a Pb/Pt catalyst system gives the possibility for a proposition of mild operating conditions. Thus under oxygen stream, at 65, pH 8, a 0.36 M solution of aqueous solution of furfural is completely transformed to furoic acid within 1 h. This requires a 2% catalytic ratio using a 5% Pt/C catalyst and lead acetate as co-catalyst (15%). This original process, characterized by a quantitative reaction which does not modify catalyst life time, is propitious to a transfer on a larger scale. For an industrial perspective of this process, serious effort has been carried out on the treatment of this reaction mixture. The entire amount of furoic acid formed is recovered by acidification of the reaction mixture to pH 1 with concentrated HC1. A reaction mechanism compatible with the results obtained and which takes the literature data into account has been proposed. The role of lead regarding P. Verdeguer et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 112 (1994) 1-11 furfural seems the basis of the originality of this process which results in the formation of furoic acid. 5.

Tel. (+33) 61175720, fax. (+33) 61175730. Catalytic oxidation of furfural leads to 2-furancarboxylic acid. The reaction is carried out in an aqueous alkaline medium under a stream of oxygen in the presence of a bi-metallic lead/platinum deposited on charcoal catalyst. The effect of the main reaction parameters is studied and a reaction scheme is proposed taking in account the results obtained.
