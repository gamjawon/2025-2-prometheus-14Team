Influence of the calcination temperature on the catalytic activity/selectivity and catalyst deactivation due to coking in the propane aromatization process (at 550) has also been thoroughly investigated. The acidity, framework Ga, crystallinity and catalytic activity and catalyst deactivation in the propane aromatization are found to be strongly influenced by the calcination temperature, mostly because of the extensive degalliation of the zeolite, depending upon the calcination temperature. The product selectivity, shape selectivity and dehydrogenation activity relative to cracking activity, of the zeolite in the propane aromatiza- tion are influenced strongly by the calcination temperature and also by the catalyst deactivation due to coking.

Introduction ZSM-5 type H-gallosilicates (H-GaMFI) show high aromatization activity and selectivity in the conversion of lower alkanes to aromatics [1-7], which is a process of great commercial importance. The high aromatization activity/selec- tivity of this zeolite is attributed to its high activity for the dehydrogenation of alkane and naphthene intermediates [3,6,8]. The active gallium species for the dehydrogenation are not the framework Ga [2,6] but the extraframework gallium species [2,3,5,6,9] present in the zeolite due to their formation during zeolite synthesis or pretreatment [3,6,9]. However, the extraframework Ga species are active in cooperation with the framework Ga (i.e., protonic acid site), involving a bifunctional mechanism [5,6]. The deactivation of this zeolite catalyst in the propane aromatization is, however, quite fast [3,6,7]. Very recently, it is shown that the thermal treatments to H-GaMFI at 700-800 under dry air flow results in a significant increase in its selectivity in propane aromatization due to the formation of well dispersed extraframework gallium species [6]. It is, therefore, interesting to study in details the influence of calcination temperature on the acidity/acid strength distribution, extent of degalliation, activity/selectivity and deactivation due to coking of H-GaMFI in the propane aromatization process. The present investigation was done for this purpose. 2. Experimental H-GaMFI zeolite samples were obtained from NH4-GaMFI (bulk Si/Ga = 33, crystal size 6-7 /zm and NH4exchange--90%) by its deammoniation at different temperatures (600-1100) under static air for 4 h. The NH4-GaMFI was prepared by exchanging H-Na-GaMFI (obtained after calcining TPA-GaMFI at 550 in static air for 15 h) with 1 M ammonium nitrate solution repeatedly (for 4 times) at 80 for 1 h, washing with demineralized water and drying at 120 for 4 h, pressing binder-flee and crushing to 0.2-0.3 mm size particles. The TPA-GaMFI was synthesized by its hydrothermal crystallization from a gel (pH 9-10) consisting of Na-trisilicate (Fluka) (50.0g), gallium nitrate (Aldrich) (5.0 g), TPA-Br (Aldrich) (5.7 g), sulfuric acid (BDH, Analar) (28.8 ml) and demineralized water (300 ml) in a stainless steel autoclave at 180 for 24 h. The TPA-GaMFI zeolite crystals were washed and dried at 120 for 4 h. The MFI framework structure of the zeolite was confirmed by its XRD and FFIR analysis. The incorporation of Ga in the zeolite framework was confirmed 71 29 by its Ga and Si M_AS NMR. The zeolite samples (obtained by the calcination of NH4GaMFI at different temperatures) were characterized by XRD (using Philips diffractometer-1700 series), FTIR (using Perkin-Elmer FTIR 1600 series), XPS (using ESCA V.R. Choudhary et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 136 (1996) 125-142 127 Scientific VG 7274), 71Ga and 29Si MAS NMR (using Bruker MSL 300 MHz spectrometer, 2 /zs pulse and a flip angle of 45 the samples were spun at 3-3.5 kHz). The bulk Si/Ga ratio and Na-content of the zeolite samples were determined by the chemical analysis. The zeolite samples were further characterized for their acidity/acid strength distribution by measuring step-wise thermal desorption (STD) of pyridine from 100-400 in a number of temperature steps (viz. 100-175, 175-250, 250-325 and 325-400) and also by determining chemisorption of pyridine at different temperatures (100-400), using the GC adsorption/desorption methods [10,11]. The detailed procedures for measuring the acidity distribution on the zeolites are given in earlier papers [7,10,11]. The chemisorption in the present case is defined as the amount of pyridine retained by a presaturated zeolite after it is swept with pure N2 (20 cm3 min-1) for a period of 1 h. The catalytic activity/selectivity of the zeolite samples in the acid catalyzed model reactions, viz. isooctane cracking (at 400) for characterizing external acidity, and o-xylene isomerization (at 400) and toluene disproportionation (at 500) for measuring the overall acidity, were determined using a pulse micro-reactor (made up of quartz tube with id = 4.5 mm and od = 6.0 mm and l = 30 cm) packed with 0.1 g zeolite catalyst. The microreactor was connected directly to a gas chromatograph with FID and computing integrator. The pulse reactions were carried out by injecting 0.4/xl reactant at the respective reaction temperatures and analyzing the reaction products by the on-line GC, using a column (3 mm x 5 m) of Benton-34 (5%)-dinonylphthalate (5%) on Chro- mosorb-W. Pure N2 (20 cm3 min-1) passed over molecular sieves and Oxysorb was used as a carrier gas. The activity/selectivity and catalyst deactivation due to coking were mea- sured as a function of time-on-stream (up to about 8.6 _+ 0.4 h) in propane aromatization (at 550 and 1 atm pressure) were investigated using a continu- ous flow quartz reactor (i.d = 13 mm) containing 1 g zeolite catalyst and provided with a Cr-Al thermocouple located axially in the center of the catalyst bed. The reaction was carried out using 33 mol-% propane and 67 mol-% N2 gas mixture as a feed at a gas hourly space velocity of 3100 cm3 (STP) g- 1 h- and analyzing the reaction products by an on-line GC using Poropak-Q (3 mm x 3 m) and Benton-34 (5%)-dinonylphthalate (5%) on Chromosorb-W (3 mm 5 m) columns for separating C1-C4 and aromatics, respectively. The catalytic activity/selectivity data at different space velocities were obtained in the absence of catalyst deactivation (i.e., initial activity/selectivity) at 550 by carrying out the propane aromatization under steady-state for a short period (5 min) and then replacing the reactant by pure N2 during the period of product analysis by GC. The carbon deposited on the catalysts was determined by microanalysis. Before the reaction, the zeolite catalysts were pretreated in situ in a flow of moisture-free N2 (30 cm3 min-1) at 550 for a period of 1 h. 128 V.R.

Choudhary et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 136 (1996) 125-142 129 frequency (at about 100 cm-1) is increased significantly, with increasing the calcination temperature. Since, the T-sites in ZSM-5 type zeolites are not crystallographically identi- cal, the determination of FW Si/Ga ratio from X9si MAS NMR is not very accurate [12]. Nevertheless, the changes in the FW-Ga and non-FW Ga are large enough to draw a conclusion about the degalliation during the catalyst calcina- tion. The observed heavy degalliation of the zeolite was further confirmed by observing a large decrease in the 71Ga MAS NMR peak intensity (at + 156 ppm) with increasing the calcination temperature (Fig. 2) and also by the observed increase in the IR asymmetric stretching frequency (Fig. lc) [13]. It may be noted that the bulk Si/Ga ratio of the zeolite is not changed significantly due to the calcination even at 900. The XPS analysis of the zeolite calcined at the different temperatures has indicated that the calcination temperature has no significant effect on the concentration of Ga on the external surface of the zeolite crystallites. This indicates that the Ga-oxide species formed due to degalliation are present in the zeolite channels. 3.2. Acidity / acid strength distribution Results showing a strong influence of the calcination temperature on the acidity and acid strength distribution on the zeolite (measured by the STD and chemisorption of pyridine at 100-400) are presented in Figs. 3 and 4. The columns in Fig. 3 show site energy distribution of the acid sites involve in the chemisorption of pyridine at 100. Each column of the site energy distribution represents a number of acid sites measured in terms of the pyridine desorbed in the corresponding step. The energy of the sites is expressed in terms of the desorption temperature, Td, which lies in the range of temperature, T1 < Td ~< T2, in which the chemisorbed pyridine is desorbed. Td* corresponds to the temperature at which pyridine is not chemisorbed at all. The data for 400 < Td ~< Td* was obtained as the chemisorption of pyridine at 400, measured by the GC pulse technique [10]. The results on the STD and chemisorption of pyridine (Figs. 3 and 4a) reveal that the acid strength distribution on the zeolite is quite broad and it is strongly influenced by the calcination temperature. The zeolitic acid sites (strong acidity measured in terms of the pyridine chemisorbed at 400) are decreased sharply with increasing calcination temperature (Fig. 4b). The observed decrease in the acidity is mostly due to degalliation of the zeolite. Similar to H-ZSM-5 [14,15], the acidity of H-GaMFI is also attributed to the tetrahedral Ga (i.e., FW-Ga) in the zeolite [7]. Indeed, as expected, the strong acidity is found to be directly proportional to the FW Ga (Fig. 4c). Whereas, the total acidity (measured by the pyridine chemisorption at 100) is not directly proportional to the FW Ga. The weak acid sites (i.e., those involved in the desorption of pyridine between 130 V.R.

Te = 600 (a), 750 (b), 900 (c) and ll00 (d). 100-250) are expected to be mainly due to the non-FW Ga-oxide species and terminal/defect silanol groups of the zeolite. The protonic acidity is also expected to be decreased by the dehydroxylation of the zeolite during its calcination at higher temperature. However, in this case the dehydroxylation is accompanied with the extensive degalliation. 3.3. Acid catalyzed model reactions Influence of the calcination temperature on the external (i.e., intercrystalline) acidity of the zeolite has been investigated by the isooctane cracking (at 400) V.R.

Fig. 5a shows an exponential decrease in the isooctane cracking activity and, hence, in the external strong acidity of the zeolite with increasing the calcination temperature. Since, isooctane cannot penetrate the channels of ZSM-5 type zeolites at 400 [16,17], the isooctane cracking activity provides an information on the external strong acid sites. Earlier studies [16,17] showed that isooctane cracking occurs on the strong acid sites. The observed sharp decrease in the external acidity is mostly due to the degalliation of FW Ga present on the external surface of the zeolite crystallites. Results in Fig. 5b and Fig. 5c show that the catalytic activity in the o-xylene isomerization and toluene disproportionation reactions is also decreased markedly with increasing the calcination temperature. This indicates that the overall zeolitic acidity is decreased exponentially with increasing the calcination tem- perature. It may be noted that almost the same trend is observed for the decrease of external and overall acidity of the zeolite. The observed decrease in the catalytic activity for the above reactions (Fig. 5) 132 V.R.

Fig. 6 shows an excellent (linear) correlation between the strong acidity and the catalytic activity in the iso-octane cracking, o-xylene isomerization and toluene disproportionation reactions, indicating that the catalytic activity is directly proportional to the strong acidity. Whereas, the relationship between the catalytic activity for the reactions and the total acidity (measured by the pyridine chemisorption at 100) is found to be non-linear. 3.4.

The catalytic activity is decreased quite rapidly with increasing time-on-stream, indicating fast deactivation of the zeolite in the reaction. Earlier studies [7] have shown that the catalyst deactivation is mainly due to the coke deposition on the zeolite during the propane aromatization processes. Values of the deactivation rate constant, kd, and the carbon deposited on the zeolite calcined at different temperatures are given in Table 1. The carbon deposition on the zeolite is decreased with increasing the calcination tempera- ture. However, the changes in the deactivation rate constant are quite complex. The deactivation rate constant was estimated from linear plots of In{In[i/(1 - x)]} vs. time-on-stream (where, x is fractional conversion), according to the V.R.

These observations reveal that the shape selectiv- ity or para selectivity of the zeolite is drastically increased with increasing the calcination temperature and also the catalyst deactivation. The observed increase in the shape selectivity of the zeolite due to increase in the calcination temperature is attributed mainly to the increased intracrystalline diffusional resistance because of a reduction in the effective channel diameter due to the presence of gallium oxide species (formed by the degalliation) in the zeolite channels. The increase in the zeolite shape selectivity with increasing the time-on-stream (i.e., increasing catalyst deactivation) is also attributed mostly to the increased intracrystalline diffusional resistance because of the deposition of coke on the zeolite at its external crystal surface blocking partially or completely some of the channel openings. Results showing the influence of catalyst deactivation due to coking on the selectivity for aromatics, propene and cracked products (C1 + C2 hydrocarbons) and also on the dehydrogenation/cracking (D/C) and aromatization/cracking (A/C) activity ratios in the propane aromatization are presented in Table 2. The results on the fresh and deactivated catalysts are compared at almost the same propane conversion. The results indicate that, because of the catalyst deactiva- tion, the aromatics selectivity and the D/C and A/C activity ratios are decreased appreciably, whereas the selectivity for propene and C1 + C2 hydro- carbons is increased. The decrease in the dehydrogenation and aromatization activity relative to the cracking one clearly shows that the dehydrogenation sites which are also essential for the aromatization are deactivated faster than the cracking sites (i.e., the strong acidic sites) of the zeolite. 3.4.2.

Influence of calcination temperature on the total propane conversion and to aromatics in the propane aromatization over H-GaMFI zeolite. propane aromatization are presented in Figs. 9 and 10, respectively. Variation of the propane conversion and the aromatics selectivity and D/C activity ratio (at the same conversion of propane viz. 4% and 15%) with the strong acidity and also with the FW Ga/bulk Ga ratio is shown in Fig. 11. Fig. 9 shows a strong influence of the calcination temperature on the initial activity of the zeolite. Both the total propane conversion and its conversion to aromatics are decreased sharply with increasing the calcination temperature; at and above the calcination temperature of 900, the formation of aromatics is negligibly small. The decrease in the activity is expected mostly because of the extensive degalliation of the zeolite at the higher temperature, causing a large decrease in the FW Ga and consequently in the zeolitic strong acidity. This is supported by the fact that the propane conversion activity is increased markedly with increasing the strong acidity (measured in terms of pyridine chemisorbed at 400) almost linearly. The activity is also increased very appreciably with increasing the FW Ga/bulk Ga ratio of the zeolite (Fig. 11). The results in Fig. 10 show that the selectivity, D/C activity ratio and aromatics/(C1 + C2) mass ratio (at the propane conversion, X = 4% and 15%) are also influenced appreciably by the calcination temperature.

The changes in the product selectivity are expected mainly due to the extensive degalliation of the zeolite, resulting into a large decrease in the FW Ga and consequently in the zeolitic acidity. As expected from the above, indeed the aromatics selectivity is increased with the increase in the strong acidity and also with the increase in the FW Ga/bulk Ga ratio (Fig. 11). 140 V.R.

The increase in the dehydrogenation/cracking activity ratio is also expected mostly due to the decrease in the zeolitic acidity responsible for the cracking activity and also because of the increase in the non-FW Ga-oxide species responsible for the dehydrogenation activity. This is consistent with the ob- served decrease in the D/C activity ratio with increasing the strong acidity and/or FW Ga/bulk Ga ratio (Fig. 11), particularly at the lower conversion. The smaller influence on the D/C activity ratio at the higher conversion may probably be due to the fact that, at higher conversions, cracking of higher hydrocarbons and dealkylation of aromatics are also expected to occur to an appreciable extent. V.R. Choudhary et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 136 (1996) 125-142 141 4. Conclusions This investigation leads to the following important conclusions. (1) The calcination of H-GaMFI at higher temperatures causes not only dehydroxylation but also heavy degalliation of the zeolite, accompanied by a loss of its crystallinity and acidity. The degalliation is almost complete at about 900. The degalliation is responsible for a large decrease in the zeolitic acidity, both the internal and external strong acid sites, depending upon the calcination temperature. The strong acidity (measured in terms of pyridine chemisorbed at 400) shows a linear dependence on the framework Ga of the zeolite. (2) A linear correlation exists between the strong acidity of the zeolite and its activity in the iso-octane cracking, o-xylene isomerization and toluene dispro- portionation reactions. (3) The activity and aromatics selectivity of the zeolite in the propane aromatization is greatly reduced due to its calcination at higher temperature. However, the reduction in the acid function is much more than the dehydrogena- tion activity of the zeolite. This is attributed to the decrease in the FW Ga (or zeolitic acidity) and consequently the increase in the non-FW Ga-oxide species, resulting from the degalliation of the zeolite. The strong dependence of the activity and selectivity on the zeolitic acidity and/or on the FW Ga/bulk Ga ratio has indicated that larger number of zeolitic acid sites are essential for higher propane aromatization activity of H-GaMFI. (4) The influence of calcination temperature on the catalyst deactivation in the propane aromatization is quite complex. Because of the catalyst deactivation due to coking, not only the catalyst activity is decreased but also the aromatics selectivity and the dehydrogenation function relative to the cracking one are reduced. The shape selectivity of the zeolite is however increased with increas- ing the catalyst deactivation and also with increasing the calcination temperature (i.e., degalliation) of the zeolite.

H-Gallosilicate (MFI) (bulk Si/Ga = 33) calcined at different temperatures (600–1100°C) has been characterized for its acidity/acid strength distribution (by step wise thermal desorption and chemisorption of pyridine at 100–400°C), acid function by acid catalyzed model reactions (viz. isooctane cracking (at 400°C) for external acid sites and o-xylene isomerization (at 400°C) and toluene disproportionation (at 500°C) for overall acid sites), crystallinity by XRD, incorporation of Ga in the zeolite framework by 71Ga MAS NMR and FTIR, and framework and non-framework Ga by 29Si MAS NMR and bulk chemical analysis. Influence of the calcination temperature on the catalytic activity/selectivity and catalyst deactivation due to coking in the propane aromatization process (at 550°C) has also been thoroughly investigated. The acidity, framework Ga, crystallinity and catalytic activity and catalyst deactivation in the propane aromatization are found to be strongly influenced by the calcination temperature, mostly because of the extensive degalliation of the zeolite, depending upon the calcination temperature. The product selectivity, shape selectivity and dehydrogenation activity relative to cracking activity, of the zeolite in the propane aromatization are influenced strongly by the calcination temperature and also by the catalyst deactivation due to coking.
