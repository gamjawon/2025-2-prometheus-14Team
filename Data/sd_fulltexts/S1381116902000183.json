Two series Rh catalysts were prepared depending on the kind of the support: (i) Rh supported on zeolite and (ii) on oxide carriers. Rh/NaY zeolite catalysts were prepared by ion-exchange from an aqueous solution of [Rh(NH3)5]Cl3. Rh catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3, Nb2O5 and TiO2 were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method of the carrier with an aqueous solution of RhCl3·2H2O. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), temperature-programmed desorption of hydrogen (TPD-H2). Test reaction for Rh catalysts was CO2 reforming of methane at different reaction temperatures. TPD data showed that the dispersion of metal particles depends on the pretreatment activation procedure; highest dispersion was observed for samples previously calcined and then activated in H2. Catalysts activated directly in H2, steam or submitted directly to the reaction conditions showed large metal particles. The effect of the protons on the destabilization of the zeolite framework during reaction was revealed by the higher Si/Al ratios, due to a dealumination of the zeolite. Neutralization of protons with solution of NaOH leaded to a stabilization of the dispersion and zeolite structure. Correlation between the dispersion and specific activity in CO2 reforming was found for zeolite-supported Rh catalysts. When the activities are compared by turnover frequencies, oxide-supported Rh catalysts are significantly more active compared to zeolite-supported ones due to a higher degree of participation of the reverse water–gas shift reaction (WGSR). The difference in activity and thermal stability was related to the nature of the support. Keywords Rhodium catalysts Zeolite Oxides CO2 reforming of CH4 XRD TPD 29Si NMR 1 Introduction The catalytic process of carbon dioxide reforming of methane to synthesis gas, which converts two of the most abundant and cheapest carbon-containing gases (CH4 and CO2) into a useful chemical products, has received considerable attention in recent years [1–6]. This reaction offers important advantages: (i) the formation of a suitable H2/CO ratio for use in a Fischer–Tropsh synthesis to liquid carbons [7], (ii) reducing of CO2 and methane emissions as both gases are contributors to the greenhouse effect [8] and (iii) better use in the chemical energy transmission [9]. The research of the catalysts for this reaction has been mainly focused on the intrinsic activity of the metal phase, on its stability towards carbon formation, the type of the support most suitable for improving the efficiency of the catalyst and the reaction mechanism. Although the extensively development of catalysts based on non-noble metals (Fe, Co or Ni) from the industrial point of view, these catalysts have shown very high activity, which is completely lost within a few hours of reaction, that is due to the formation of a stable and inactive carbon on the surface [10–13]. Because of this, recently numerous studies related to the reforming of methane with carbon dioxide were focused over noble metal catalysts supported on different carriers, which exhibit better activity and very high stability due to the less sensitivity to carbon deposition [14,15] compared to non-noble metal catalysts. Rostrup-Nielsen [15] comparing catalysts based on nickel, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, iridium and platinum has found that ruthenium and rhodium showed high selectivity for carbon-free operation. It has been found that the performance of Rh catalysts under reaction conditions of CO2 reforming of methane strongly depends on the carrier employed to disperse the metal. The initial specific activity, the deactivation rate, and the carbon deposition were found to depend on the support material. Zhang et al. [16] showed that three main factors are contributed to the catalyst deactivation of Rh catalysts supported on different carriers: (i) carbon deposition, (ii) sintering of metal crystallites and (iii) blocking of the Rh surface sites by species originating from the carrier, as the importance of each factor is strongly determined by the nature of the carrier and the size of metal particles. In our previous work [6], studying ruthenium catalysts supported on zeolite and amorphous carriers in CO2 reforming of methane, it has been shown that the activity was strongly effected by the activation procedure applied to the catalyst before to be used in the reaction. In this work we attempted to find a correlation between the activity of Rh-containing catalysts in CO2 reforming of methane and their structure after different primary treatment. A comparison of the catalytic behavior of rhodium catalysts supported on Y-zeolite and oxide supports such Al2O3, TiO2 and Nb2O3 was done. Different techniques were applied for characterization of the samples: X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance (29Si NMR) and temperature-programmed reduction of hydrogen (TPR-H2). 2 Experimental 2.1 Sample preparation 2.1.1 Zeolite-supported Rh catalysts NaY was prepared from LZ Y-52 (Si/Al=2.6, Linde Molecular Sieves) by two successive exchanges with NaNO3, according to the method previously described [17]. Rh/NaY and Rh/NaMOR were prepared by ion-exchange starting from an aqueous solution of [Rh(NH3)5]Cl3. The dilute solution of [Rh(NH3)5]Cl3 (0.003M) was slowly added to a stirred zeolite slurry (3g/l) at 353K over a period of 12h, followed by an additional stirring for 60h. The samples were filtered and washed at room temperature with doubly deionized water until Cl− free. This followed by drying of the samples at room temperature in air and in a vacuum desiccator for 3h. The resulting samples were stored in a desiccator over a saturated MH4Cl solution before to be used. The content of Rh was 3wt.%. 2.1.2 Amorphous-supported catalysts Rhodium catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3, Nb2O5 and TiO2 were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method using an aqueous solution of RhCl3·2H2O with appropriate concentration followed by drying in a rough vacuum at room temperature. The content of Rh was 1–3wt.%. 2.2 Activation procedure NaY-supported [Rh(NH3)5(H2O)]3+ catalysts before using in test reaction were activated by different procedures: (A) Sample was heated in a flow of He (100ml/min) up to 773K at rate of 2K/min. This sample was labeled Rh/NaY-A. (B) Samples were heated up to 653 or 773K in a flow of pure O2 (100ml/min) at a rate of 2K/min and then maintained at these temperatures for 2h. After that the samples were cooled to room temperature, followed by reduction in a flow of pure H2 at 100ml/min up to 673K and maintained at this temperature for 2h. The samples were labeled Rh/NaY-B1 and Rh/NaY-B2 calcined at 653 and 773K, respectively. (C) Sample was directly activated under reaction conditions by heating in a mixture of CH4/CO2/N2 (20/20/60) from room temperature up to the reaction temperature of 973K at a rate of 2K/min in a total flow of 100ml/min. The sample was labeled Rh/NaY-C. (D) Sample was activated by a procedure similar to B1, followed by ion-exchange neutralization in two successive treatments with a 1M aqueous solution of NaOH (pH=10) at room temperature. The sample was labeled Rh/NaYN-D. (E) Sample was activated by the procedure similar to B1, after that was exposed to a steam action by heating from room temperature up to 973K at 2K/min in a H2/H2O/He (5/2.6/92.4) mixture at a total flow rate of 100ml/min and maintained at this temperature for 2h. This sample was labeled Rh/NaYvap-E. (F) Sample was firstly activated by the procedure similar to that described for Rh/NaYN-D and then was exposed to a steam in H2/H2O/He (5/2.6/92.4) at 973K at a total flow of 20ml/min. The sample was labeled Rh/NaYN,vap-F. (G) Sample was activated by the procedure similar to that for Rh/NaYN-D and then exposed to H2 up to 673K for 2h. Sample was labeled Rh/NaYN+H2 -G. (H) Sample was heated in a H2 flow of 100ml/min at a rate of 2K/min from room temperature up to 673K and maintained at this temperature for 2h. The sample was labeled Rh/NaY-H. Rh supported on Na mordenite was activated by the procedure similar to B1 and was labeled Rh/NaMOR-B1. The neutralized sample was labeled Rh/NaMORN-B1. Rh catalysts supported on oxide supports, Nb2O5, Al2O3 and TiO2, were activated by the procedure E and were labeled Rh/Nb2O5 vap-E, Rh/Al2O3 vap-E and Rh/TiO2 vap-E, respectively. 2.3 Characterization Chemical analysis of the samples was performed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP). XPS was performed using a XSAM HS spectrometer from Kratos Analytical. Radiation source was Mg Kα (power given by 15kV and 15mA). The pressure in analysis chamber was 10−9 Torr. Samples were flooded with low energy electrons from a flood gun to avoid charging effect. XRD patterns were carried out by a Siemens D-5000 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (40kV, 40mA) with a Ni filter. Data were collected for the spent catalysts. 29Si MAS NMR spectra were carried out using a Varian Unity Plus 400MHz spectrometer operating at 9.4T using 7mm diameter rotors spinning at 5kHz. Quantitative spectra were measured at 79.5MHz with 50° radio-frequency pulses and 30s recycle delays. Chemical shifts (σ) were given in relation to a tetramethyl-silane (TMS) adjusted for a single 29Si resonance at −91.5ppm of kaolinite, consistent with the presence of a single Q3 (OAL) silicon environment [18]. The framework Si/Al ratio from 29Si NMR spectra was determined according to the equation given by Klinowski et al. [19]. The Si/Al ratio accuracy calculated by integrating Gaussian curves was around 5%. Temperature-programmed desorption of hydrogen (TPD-H2) analyses of the samples were performed using a Micromeritics Pulse Chemisorb 2705. After activation, samples were exposed to 5% H2/Ar (30ml/min) and heated from 298 to 773K at 10K/min. Samples were cooled to room temperature for 2h and purged in Ar for 30min. The stabilization of H2 adsorption and of the system was monitored with TCD detector. The samples were cooled to 253K, then heated from 253 to 873K at 10K/min. Error in quantification of the TPD results was estimated at ±3–5%. The amount of H2 desorbed during TPD analysis was obtained by integration of the TPD profiles and was used to estimate the dispersion of metal particles. The TPD data were expressed as H/Rh molar ratios. 2.4 Reaction The CO2 reforming reaction of CH4 was carried out in a continuous flow quartz tube reactor at 1atm pressure with a constant feed of composition of CH4/CO2/N2 of 20/20/60, respectively at a total flow rate of 100ml/min, with a 0.05–0.2g of catalyst. The Rh catalysts were tested in the temperature range of 723–973K. The Rh/zeolite catalysts were maintained in the reaction conditions for 300h. The reaction data was monitored after 15min on stream. The turnover frequencies (TOF) results for oxide-supported catalysts were calculated in initial time on stream, which was estimated from plot of activity versus time on stream. Reaction products were analyzed by on-line gas chromatography, employing a combination of two GCs (Varian-3400) having a TCD detector. One chromatograph employed He and the other N2 as carrier gas. For reaction product analysis, two columns of Porapak N and Molecular Sieve 13 X were used in a series-bypass arrangement. TOF and rates (mol i /s) per number of Rh on surface (molRh) were determined under different CH4 conversions obtained by variation of the total flow rate (Table 3). 3 Results 3.1 XPS results XPS data of Rh/NaY samples obtained by encapsulating of [Rh(NH3)5(H2O)]3+ demonstrate the absence of Cl− ions. 3.2 XRD spectra XRD spectra of the Rh/NaY samples after reaction are shown on Fig. 1 . For comparison the XRD spectrum of the initial [Rh(NH3)5H2O]3+/NaY zeolite presents (Fig. 1a). There is a change of the intensity of XRD peaks of the samples depending on the pretreatment procedure. A small decrease of the intensity of the XRD peaks is observed for samples treated in O2 at 653 and 773K followed by heating in H2, as well as for Rh/NaYvap-E sample (Fig. 1b, c and f). XRD spectrum of the Rh/NaY-C sample submitted to the reaction conditions (Fig. 1d) shows the lowest intensity of the diffraction peaks of the zeolite Y, meaning a partial destruction of the zeolite matrix. Neutralized sample, Rh/NaYN-D, presents XRD patterns similar to those of the initial NaY zeolite that suggests a higher degree of preserved crystalline (Fig. 1e). 3.3 TPD-H2 results TPD data (H/Rh) for all samples are listed in Table 1 . It is seen from Table 1 that the different activation procedures have a significant effect on the particle size of the catalysts. The samples previously calcined at different temperatures and then reduced by hydrogen show the highest H/Rh ratios of 1 and 0.98, respectively for Rh/NaY-B1 and Rh/NaY-B2. This indicates a high dispersion of metal particles. After neutralization of the protons with NaOH the Rh/NaYN-D and Rh/NaYN+H2 -G samples have also a high H/Rh of 0.90. Non-neutralized sample after treatment in the steam, Rh/NaYvap-E, shows a significant decrease of the H/Rh ratio from 1.0 to 0.42, as well as the neutralized sample exposed to H2O/H2, Rh/NaYN,vap (Table 1). The Rh/NaY-B1 and neutralized, Rh/NaYN-D, samples after reaction show slowly decrease of the H/Rh ratio (0.86 and 0.85, respectively), suggesting that the dispersion of Rh particles, practically does not significantly change during reforming of CH4. However, the sample submitted directly to the conditions of the reaction, Rh/NaY-C, shows very low H/Rh of 0.18. The zeolite-supported [Rh(NH3)5(H2O)]3+ complex after heating in He undergoes extensive autoreduction leading to a formation of large metal particles (Table 1). It has been shown [20] that the heating of [Rh(NH3)5(H2O)]3+-loaded NaY in argon up to 773K leads to 100% autoreduction of rhodium and a formation of rather large rhodium particles. Large Rh particles are formed when Rh/NaY sample is reduced directly in H2 confirmed by the lowest value of H/Rh ratio of 0.16. Rh supported on mordenite also shows low H/Rh ratio before to be neutralized (Table 1). The H/Rh ratio for Rh catalysts supported on oxide supports decreases in the following order: Rh/Al2O3>Rh/Nb2O5>Rh/TiO2 (Table 1). The values of H/Rh ratios of these catalysts are lower compared to those of the zeolite-supported samples treated in O2 and H2 and neutralized, meaning a lower dispersion of the Rh particles on the amorphous supports. 3.4 29 Si NMR spectra 29Si NMR spectra of the initial NaY zeolite and spent NaY-supported Rh catalysts treated by different activation procedures are shown in Fig. 2 A and B. Values of the framework Si/Al ratio for the spent catalysts are listed in Table 2 . 29Si NMR spectrum of NaY zeolite (Fig. 2A(a)) shows four peaks with chemical shifts (σ) at −104.5, −99.4, −93.5 and −87.9ppm related to Si(0Al), Si(1Al), Si(2Al) and Si(3Al) environments, respectively with Si/Al ratio of 2.6. It is seen from Table 2 that Si/Al ratio of the zeolite framework structure of the samples is changed with the different procedures of treatment, as well as the intensities of peaks (Fig. 2). The samples treated in He, H2 atmosphere and non-neutralized have a higher Si/Al ratio compared to that of the initial NaY zeolite (Fig. 2A(a) and (d) and Fig. 2B(a), (b) and (d)). This means a dealumination of the framework structure of NaY zeolite during reaction. With extent of the dealumination the intensities of the first peak, Si(0Al), and the second peak, Si(1Al) increase, while the intensities of the third peak, Si(2Al), and the fourth peak, Si(3Al), decrease. The highest value of Si/Al ratio of 3 is obtained for sample exposed directly to the conditions of reaction, suggesting a stronger dealumination (Table 2). Rh/NaMOR sample also exhibits higher Si/Al ratio value after reaction. However, the samples exposed to a neutralization of protons (Rh/NaYN, Rh/NaYN+H2 and Rh/NaMORN) show similar Si/Al ratios to those of the initial NaY and NaMOR (2.6, 2.7 and 8.0, respectively; Table 2). 3.5 Catalytic activity data Catalytic activity data for Rh catalysts supported on NaY zeolite and oxide carriers in the reaction of CO2 reforming of CH4 at 773 and 873K temperatures are listed in Table 2. It is seen that the conversion of CH4 and CO2 is strongly influenced by the method of preparation and preliminary activation of the catalysts. Rh/NaY catalysts activated in He, H2 and H2/H2O only and those submitted directly to the conditions of the reaction show very low conversions as well as a low specific activity (r). This phenomenon can be connected with both, the stronger dealumination of the zeolite framework and the agglomeration of rhodium particles confirmed by the 29Si NMR (Fig. 2) and TPD-H2 data (Table 1), respectively. Catalysts activated in oxygen, followed by hydrogen activation, and neutralized ones show the highest CH4 and CO2 conversions in CO2 reforming of methane as well as the highest specific activity (Table 2). According to the different activation procedures, the specific activity of the zeolite-supported Rh catalysts decreases in the following order: Rh/NaY-B≈Rh/NaYN+H2 -G>Rh/NaMORN-B1>Rh/NaYN-D>Rh/NaMOR-B1>Rh/NaY-C>Rh/NaYvap≈Rh/NaY-A>Rh/NaY-H. The activity of the neutralized catalyst, which after reaction was re-oxidated and re-activated, does not change (Table 2). The conversions increase with increasing of the reaction temperature. It should be expected that the H2/CO ratio be also increased. However, all catalysts at 773 and 873K show H2/CO ratio lower than 1 (Table 2), meaning that the thermodynamic equilibrium is not reached. However, for runs with a 0.200g of catalyst at temperature about 973K data of the equilibrium constant, K p was close to the ratio Q=P CO 2×P H2 2×P CH4 −1×P CO2 −1. According to calculation related to partial pressures and temperature differences between bulk fluid and surface of the catalyst particle [21], any external mass and heat transfer were observed within our experimental conditions. It has been shown that TOF of Ru/NaY catalysts [6] as well as Ru catalysts supported on oxide supports, were very active in CO [5] and CO2 hydrogenation [22]. It was suggested that a reverse water–gas shift reaction (WGSR) prevails at lower temperature in agreement with thermodynamics [23]. The measured H2/CO ratios from Table 2 showed good agreement with those calculated by Eq. (1), presented by Bradford and Vannice [5] when the reaction equilibrium of production of synthesis gas from methane and carbon dioxide (2) is influenced by the simultaneous occurrence of the reverse WGSR (3): (1) H 2 CO = 3− r CO 2 r CH 4 1+ r CO 2 r CH 4 (2) CH 4+CO 2⇔2CO+2H 2 (3) CO 2+H 2⇔CO+H 2 O where r CH4 and r CO2 are the experimental rates of CH4 and CO2 conversions, respectively (Table 2). If the observed TOF for the net rate of CO2 reforming of CH4 at 723K, TOFobs, is influenced by the reverse reaction, the net rate can be approximated by the following expression [5]: (4) TOF obs =TOF for −TOF rev =TOF for −krP H 2 γP CO δ where TOFfor and TOFrev are the turnover frequencies for the forward CO2 reforming reaction of CH4 (including the reverse WGSR) and for the reverse reaction (CO hydrogenation), respectively, kr the rate constant for hydrogenation of CO, and P H2 and P CO are the partial pressures for H2 and CO, respectively. The values of TOFfor and the kinetics parameters γ and δ obtained for TOFCO according to Eq. (4) are summarized in Table 3 . The dependence of TOF for CO formation on the partial pressures of CO and H2 for different catalysts is, approximately linear as is shown on Fig. 3 . The observed trend in TOFCO with partial pressures of H2 and CO shows an influence of the reverse reaction. This empirical analysis indicates that significantly high space velocities must be used to maintain low conversions which decrease effluent partial pressures H2 and CO and thus minimize the influence of the reverse reaction during kinetic studies of CO2 reforming of CH4. The calculated values of kr as well as the values of TOF for zeolite-supported Rh catalysts are much lower than those for oxide-supported ones (Table 3). It means that the influence of hydrogenation in kinetic studies is minimized for Rh zeolite catalysts. It is seen from Table 2 that the values of CO2 conversion are greater than those for CH4 conversion, especially for oxide-supported Rh samples due to the influence of the reverse WGSR consisting with thermodynamic calculations. In addition, the values of measured H2/CO ratio for the latter catalysts are significantly lower than 1. The H2/CO product ratio determined during a series of activity tests is plotted as a function of carbon dioxide conversion for different samples in Fig. 4 . The apparent relation between carbon dioxide conversion and the H2/CO ratio indicates the strong influence of the water–gas shift equilibrium for oxide-supported Rh catalysts. This consists with results of Swaan et al. [24] and Blom et al. [25] who showed that H2/CO is a function of water–gas shift equilibrium. For Rh zeolite catalysts the H2/CO ratio are significantly higher compared to those for Rh catalysts over oxide carriers, suggesting that the influence of reverse WGSR is minimized (Table 2 and Fig. 4). When the activity of the zeolite-supported catalysts in CO2 reforming reaction is compared in terms of TOFfor (Table 3) the order of activity is the following: Rh/NaY-C>Rh/NaMOR-B>Rh/NaY-B>Rh/NaYN-D. The order of activity compared by TOF for oxide-supported catalysts is as follows: Rh/Al2O3>Rh/TiO2>Rh/Nb2O5 (Table 3). There was a pronounced difference in the catalyst stabilities under reaction conditions. The activity of Rh catalysts supported on oxide supports decrease with time on stream, whereas all zeolite-supported Rh catalysts showed stable activity over reaction time of 300h at 773K. Although the high Si/Al ratios for Rh/NaY-C, Rh/NaYvap-E, Rh/NaY-H and Rh/NaMOR samples, these catalysts showed remarkable stability in the activity under reaction conditions. Different opinions have been proposed about the unique stability of zeolite-supported noble metals [26,27]. Authors connect the high thermal stability with the dispersion of metal particles. However, Bath and Sachtler [23] have shown that the high thermal stability of Rh/NaY zeolite in CO2 reforming of CH4 was related to large Rh particles of 40Å, which are formed in the initial stage of the catalytic operation: ones they are formed no further agglomeration takes place. 4 Discussion 4.1 Effect of the activation procedure on the structure and dispersion The atmosphere of the primary thermal treatment strongly influences the rhodium particle size, consequently, the dispersion. The highest values of H/Me for Rh/NaY samples calcined at 653 or 773K and followed by reduction at 673K mean highly dispersed rhodium particles in NaY zeolite. Increasing of the temperature of calcination leads to a stabilization of the zeolite framework for Rh/NaY-B2 sample caused by the migration of the Rh3+ ions into the hexagonal prisms of zeolite. It is well known [20] that three types of rhodium species are formed in the reduced samples (after extended calcination at 773K) identified as Rh3+ in supercages, Rh+ in small cages and high temperature reduction species Rh3+ in hexagonal prisms. The reduction of the latter species will have higher activation energy than the reduction of the same ions in more accessible cages, where the concentration with lattice oxygen is less favorable. On the other hand, the small difference in the TPD data of both samples (Table 1) could be connected with the difference of the local environments of the rhodium particles on each of the samples. The slightly higher H/Me ratio for Rh/NaY sample calcined at lower temperature may be is due to a multiple adsorption of hydrogen on rhodium atoms similar to the high H/Rh ratio reported for highly dispersed rhodium on alumina [20], where less than 10% of the rhodium present in a cationic form. It has been shown [28] that after calcination of Rh/NaY to 653K, both RhO2 and Rh2O3 were identified, besides small amounts of RhO+ and Rh3+. However, in the case of the Rh/NaY-B2 sample calcined at higher temperature most of the rhodium present in cationic form and some [Rh n 0−H x ] x+ adducts would be formed as a result of reduction of rhodium cations to Rh0 by reducible protons like to the observation by Tomczak et al. [20] for Rh/NaY calcined at 773K. These adducts can agglomerate at high temperature (773K) and to form small clusters of adducts, adsorbing less hydrogen. On the other hand, these samples show slowly dealumination of the zeolite framework (Table 2). It has been demonstrated [23] that non-neutralized Rh/NaY zeolite after use in the reaction of CO2 reforming has rhodium particles of, approximately 40Å and their formation inside the zeolite lead to some local destruction of the zeolite framework. The lower values of H/Rh of the samples would be related to the suppression of H2 chemisorption and/or growing of the metal particles according to the literature data. The H2 chemisorption may be decreased due to metal particles filling of zeolite supercages. During the initial reduction of the precursor form of the catalyst, some of the rhodium may also have migrated to the external surface where large particles could be formed. Such distribution of metal particles between the pore system and the external zeolite surface has been demonstrated by TEM for Ru supported on zeolite [17]. On the other hand, the cause for the suppression of H2 chemisorption can be the proton-adduct formation [17] that leads to a change of the electronic structure of the Ru clusters and this induces a lowering of the propensity of these particles to chemisorb hydrogen. A significant suppression of H2 chemisorption can be occurred on Rh/zeolite due to an interaction of Rh with some zeolite hydroxyls [29]. For many catalytic reactions over zeolite-supported metal catalyst the zeolite protons can act as chemical anchors [30] for the metal particles in zeolite cages and stabilize the metal dispersion. However, the results indicate that the presence of protons and water producing during reverse WGSR destabilizes the dispersion of the metal particles, leading to favoring of the dealumination (Table 2). The very low values of H/Me ratios for the samples activated in steam, or H2 atmosphere, or exposed directly to the reaction conditions can be connected with the formation of large metal particles. TEM and EXAFS analyses of rhodium in HY and NaY zeolites [23] were demonstrated, that a high concentration of protons within the zeolite has a dramatic effect on the size of particles formed during reduction. Probably, protons formed after autoreducing of [Rh(NH3)5(H2O)]3+ complex in Rh/NaY-C catalyst and then connected with H2O produced during reverse reaction or liberated from inside of the zeolite provoke a high dealumination of the zeolite framework (Table 2). The effect of the hydrothermal treatment on the dealumination of zeolites is well known [31–33]. Dealumination through hydrothermal treatment leads to a hydrolysis of AlO bonds with a creation of defect sites in the zeolite structure and the particles easily accumulate and aggregate in these sites under reaction conditions. Neutralization of the protons in Rh/NaY samples with NaOH suppresses the formation of large metal particles and stabilizes the zeolite framework under reaction (Rh/NaYN-D, Rh/NaYN,vap-F and Rh/NaMORN) as well as the surface of Rh particles to be accessible to the reagents (Tables 1 and 2). TEM analysis of Ru/NaY catalyst treated with NaNO3 to neutralize protons after reduction was showed absence of any Ru metal particles larger than the zeolite Y supercage [17]. The importance of this neutralization to particle growth has been also documented for [Pd(NH3)4]2/NaY [34]. 4.2 Influence of the support on catalyst activity Zeolite-supported Rh catalysts show a correlation of the CH4 conversion and specific activity (r) with the accessible metal surface of the rhodium particles, as shown in Table 2. Increase of the metal dispersion leads to increase of the activity: Rh/NaY-B and neutralized Rh/NaYN and Rh/NaYN+H2 samples, having the highest dispersion, show the highest activity in CO2 reforming of CH4. Therefore, the influence of zeolite as support is limited to affecting the metal dispersion during the course of the catalyst preparation and stabilizing the metal surface area under reaction conditions, which is responsible for catalyst activity, similar to the inert SiO2 support [26,27]. The same effect has been found for zeolite-supported Ru catalysts in CO2 reforming of CH4 [6]. However, for oxide-supported catalysts there is no strong correlation between conversions and activity and the metal dispersion of Rh particles on the various supports (Table 2). It suggests that the activity of Rh catalysts supported on oxide supports depends on the type of the support: Rh supported on alumina shows the highest specific activity. It should be noted, that the zeolite- and oxide-supported Rh catalysts differ in two main aspects: (i) the H2/CO ratio is significantly higher for zeolite catalysts compared to that for amorphous-supported ones and (ii) the Rh zeolite catalysts reveal a significant stability with time on stream. When the activity of the catalysts in CO2 reforming reaction is compared in terms of TOF (Table 3) it is seen that the CO2 reforming of CH4 over oxide-supported Rh catalysts is coupled with reverse WGSR, which is quasi-equilibrated under reaction conditions. Experimental results indicate that the H2/CO product ratio for oxide-supported Rh catalysts is a function of carbon dioxide formation (Fig. 4). Consequently, lower H2/CO product ratio is obtained for these catalysts (Table 2). The kinetic data for Rh zeolite catalysts are not significantly influenced by the reverse reaction and the relative low values of TOF for Rh zeolite catalysts are likely due to the effect of the overall reverse reaction, which CO hydrogenation to CH4 constitutes the initial reaction [5]. The difference in the catalytic behaviors of the samples could be strongly affected by the nature of the carrier, suggesting that the activity and rate of deactivation on metal particle size is likely to be related to the different extent of electronic interaction between metal and support, influencing the bonding and reactivity of the chemisorbed species [35,36]. It should be noted that the activity of Rh/Nb2O5 catalyst is high and similar to that of Rh/Al2O3 catalyst, while the rate constant for CO hydrogenation is very low and similar to that for Rh catalysts supported on NaY (Table 3). Therefore, it is reasonable to suppose that different mechanisms of activation of the reagents take place on the surface of the catalysts supported on Al2O3 and Nb2O5. It has been shown [37] that the CO chemisorption on Rh/Nb2O5 catalyst is suppressed by a geometric blockage of the Rh surface after high temperature reduction (773K) due to more intimate contact between Rh and niobia that result in lower hydrogenation of CO. On the other hand, it is well known that partially reduced NbO x species on the metal surface greatly promote catalytic activity in CO2 reforming, because of the creation of a large number of interfacial sites [38]. Taking into account the small adsorption energy of CO2 on Rh surface (≈5kcal/mol) [39] and the fact that dissociation of CO2 on the surface of Rh is slower than dissociation of CH4, the coverage of Rh with CO2 will be very small at high temperature. According to Nakamura et al. [26] Al2O3 as support plays a role for accelerating of the CO2 dissociation by rising CO2 concentration in the vicinity of Rh particles by trapping CO2 as formate, which produce CO after its decomposition. The electron transfer from the H to CO through Rh increases the RhC bond strength, and at the same time weakens the CO bond on the surface that result in higher activity for CO hydrogenation [40]. Introduction of a strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) into Nb2O5- and TiO2-supported metal catalysts can be also correlated with an increase of the electron density in the metal crystallites [41]. It cannot be excluded the acidic character of the carrier that may promote methane dissociation via CH3+ intermediate species on the sites at the perifering of the metal crystallites as was suggested by Huder [42] and Zhang et al. [43]. The TOFfor over more dealuminated zeolite-supported Rh catalysts are higher than those over less dealuminated catalysts (Table 3). Some diffusion effect inside the structure of zeolite could not be excluded, that causes the increase of activities of Rh/NaY-C and Rh/NaMOR samples with a higher degree of agglomeration of particles. Since the CO and H2 has been reported to compete the same adsorption sites in CO hydrogenation [44], it is likely that a higher CO coverage on Rh decreases the concentration of hydrogen on the surface (i.e. H2/CO decreases) and consequently the overall rate of the CO2 reforming reaction on zeolite-supported Rh catalysts. The absence of appreciable deactivation for zeolite catalysts during 300h of time on stream is of importance for their industrial application. According to literature data different reasons would take place. The absence of coke formation as the main reason has been found for the extraordinary stability of zeolite-supported Rh catalysts. This can be related to some geometric effects caused by the microporous structure of the zeolite, which inhibits the formation of coke. Another reason for the unusual stability of the zeolite catalysts is the absence of metal agglomeration during reaction. The small decrease of H/Me ratios for Rh/NaY-B1 and Rh/NaYN-D samples (Table 1) (from 1.0 and 0.90 to 0.86 and 0.85, respectively) after they have been used in the reaction confirm the absence of a very strong sintering of the metal Rh particles during reforming process. Also, the Si/Al ratio values suggest no growth of particles beyond the size, which would lead to a drastic destruction of the zeolite framework. Dealumination of the zeolite framework does not proceed when the protons are neutralized and it leads to increase of the CH4 conversion and specific activity of the zeolite catalyst (Table 2). The thermal stability of oxide-supported catalysts is affected by the dispersion of metal particles. Rh catalyst supported on alumina with high dispersion (Table 3) exhibited higher thermal stability compared to that for niobia- and titania-supported catalysts. The different behaviors of both Rh series catalysts with respect to carbon deposition reflects different mechanistic processes occurring for the reforming of CH4 with CO2 depending on the nature of the support used. The deactivation of the oxide-supported catalysts could be related to the long residence time of the carbonaceous intermediates on the metal surface, which favor polymerization and eventually formation of graphitic-type carbon on the Rh particles. It has been shown for alumina-supported ruthenium catalyst [27] that the surface hydroxyl groups in the oxide are responsible for the diffusion process that allow mobility of oxygen and hydrogen, thus increasing the resistance to carbon deposition by oxidation of the carbonaceous adsorbed species formed from methane adsorption on the metal. The relative catalyst resistance to coking for oxide-supported Rh catalysts is Rh/Al2O3>Rh/Nb2O5>Rh/TiO2, which would be correlated with the support ability to stabilize CH x decomposition and carbon monoxide dissociation [45]. It should be noted that the initial activity of Rh supported on TiO2 was very high, but quickly deactivation after few hours was observed. We suppose that due to SMSI phenomenon TiO x species are formed, which promote the high initial activity. The strong deactivation of Rh/TiO2 catalyst may be due to either continual deposition of carbon or additional blockage of active sites by migrating TiO x species under reaction conditions and the activation barrier for methane dissociation increases [41]. On the other hand, the presence of large quantities of water formed during reverse WGSR may produce surface hydroxyl groups via dissociation of water that leads to a decomposition of formate-type intermediate CH x O species, which yield H2 and CO at the metal-support interface [41,45]. 5 Conclusions Two groups of catalysts are formed according to the procedure of the catalyst activation: (i) non-neutralized and (ii) neutralized. Non-neutralized samples suffer a partial destruction of zeolite structure after reaction. Neutralization of the protons leads to a stabilization of the zeolite framework. A correlation between the specific activity in CO2 reforming and the dispersion of metal particles for Rh/NaY zeolites is revealed. TOF for CO formation over supported Rh catalysts are strongly affected by the type of the support. The activity of oxide-supported Rh catalysts is mainly determined by the participation of the reverse WGSR. Zeolite-supported Rh catalysts reveal a strong thermal stability.

        "dc:description": "Two series Rh catalysts were prepared depending on the kind of the support: (i) Rh supported on zeolite and (ii) on oxide carriers. Rh/NaY zeolite catalysts were prepared by ion-exchange from an aqueous solution of [Rh(NH3)5]Cl3. Rh catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3, Nb2O5 and TiO2 were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method of the carrier with an aqueous solution of RhCl3·2H2O. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), temperature-programmed desorption of hydrogen (TPD-H2). Test reaction for Rh catalysts was CO2 reforming of methane at different reaction temperatures. TPD data showed that the dispersion of metal particles depends on the pretreatment activation procedure; highest dispersion was observed for samples previously calcined and then activated in H2. Catalysts activated directly in H2, steam or submitted directly to the reaction conditions showed large metal particles. The effect of the protons on the destabilization of the zeolite framework during reaction was revealed by the higher Si/Al ratios, due to a dealumination of the zeolite. Neutralization of protons with solution of NaOH leaded to a stabilization of the dispersion and zeolite structure. Correlation between the dispersion and specific activity in CO2 reforming was found for zeolite-supported Rh catalysts. When the activities are compared by turnover frequencies, oxide-supported Rh catalysts are significantly more active compared to zeolite-supported ones due to a higher degree of participation of the reverse water–gas shift reaction (WGSR). The difference in activity and thermal stability was related to the nature of the support.",
