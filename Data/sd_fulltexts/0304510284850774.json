THOMAS Department of Physical Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Lensfield Road, Cambridge CB2 1 EP (U.K.) Summary Although montmorillonites have been found to have little catalytic activity in their natural Na+ form, various cation-exchanged montmoril- lonites have proved to be effective catalysts for a wide variety of organic reactions. Alkenes can be induced to add (a) water, (b) alcohols, (c) thiols and (d) carboxylic acids to furnish ethers, thioethers and esters in the presence of these cation-exchanged sheet silicates, but amines failed to undergo addition with alkenes under similar conditions. The number of products obtained in each reaction depended upon the ease of rearrangement of the carbocation intermediates. High yields were obtained in those cases where a single carbocation intermediate was involved. The cation-exchanged sheet silicates also catalysed a variety of elimina- tion reactions. Water was eliminated from alcohols to produce ethers, ammonia was eliminated from amines to make secondary amines and hydro- gen sulphide was eliminated from thiols to give dialkyi sulphides. Cation- exchanged bentonites were also effective catalysts in the production of dioxan from ethylene oxide and in the preparation of acetals with ortho- formates. Analysis of the products from the reactions suggested that the cation- exchanged montmorillonites reacted, in nearly all cases, as acidic hetero- geneous catalysts.

This report contains a selection of the reactions studied in Swansea. Results and discussion Clay-catalysed addition reactions of alkenes Addition of water to alkenes: ether formation Alk-1-enes were found to react under reflux conditions with the water contained in the interlamellar layer of a variety of cation exchanged mont- morillonites to give an equal mixture of the two diastereoisomers of the di(alk-2-yl) ethers in addition to small amounts of the alkan-2-ol [2].

However, this was clearly a stoichio metric and not a catalytic reaction, as once the water in the clay was consumed the reaction ceased. Addition of alcohols to alkenes: ether formation In the reaction of alkenes with alcohols, ion-exchanged montmoril- lonites acted as true catalysts for the formation of ethers. For example, hex-1-ene reacted with ethanol in the presence of Al^-exchanged mont- morillonite at 150 C for 3 h in a sealed reactor to yield two ethers; 2-ethoxyhexane (14%) and 3-ethoxyhexane (3%). The reaction was rather slow and 80% of the reactants were recovered unchanged [3]. A]3+ R-CH2-CH=CH2 + EtOH - > R-CHa-CHOEt-C^ montmonllonite + R-CHOEt-CH2-CH3 The reaction was more efficient in the case of 2,2-dialkyla^kenes when 70% of the reactants were consumed to produce high yields of 2-ethoxy-2- methylpropane (68%) from the reaction of 2-methylpropene with ethanol at 100 C for 24 h in a sealed reactor. Small amounts of 2-methylpropan-2-ol were also obtained from the competitive addition of the small amount of intercalated water which was present in the clay [3]. At temperatures much above 150 C the etherification reaction failed with 2,2-dialkylalkenes, and the only observed products were alkene dimers and trimers. 159 Attempted addition of amines to alkenes The reaction of amines with alkenes failed completely and no addition products were observed [4]. Addition of thiols to alkenes: thioether formation Alkenes reacted readily with thiols in the presence of ion-exchanged montmorillonites to give high conversions to a variety of thioethers. For example, hex-1-ene reacted with butane-1-thiol in the presence of Al3\"1\"- exchanged montmorillonite at 200 C in a sealed reactor for 4 h to yield hex-l-yl,butyl sulphide (12%), hex-2-yl.butyl sulphide (30%) and hex-3- yl,butyl sulphide (23%) [5].

The most successful catalysts were Al3\"1\"-, H\"1\"- and Cr^-exchanged montmorillonites and the products depended upon the size of the alkyi chain and the tempera- ture of the reaction. Ethene reacted with ethanoic acid at 200 C in the presence of Al^-exchanged montmorillonite to give an almost quantitative yield of ethyl ethanoate after 40 h [7]. Propene also gave a single ester product (prop-2-yl ethanoate), whereas hex-1-ene gave a mixture of hex-2-yl and hex-3-yl ethanoates, and dec-1-ene gave a mixture of four esters, i.e. dec-2-, 3-, 4- and 5-yl ethanoates. A good yield of a single ester, cyclohexyl ethanoate, was also obtained from cyclohexene.

Very high yields of esters were obtained at much lower temperatures when 2,2-dialkylalkenes were employed for ester synthesis. For example, the reaction of 2-methylpropene with ethanoic acid gave 2-methylpropyl ethanoate (65%) in a very clean reaction after 24 h at 18 C [7]. Mechanism of alkene addition reactions using ion-exchanged sheet silicates Analysis of the products from the clay-catalysed reactions clearly showed that, when a 2,2-dialkylalkene was used, a single addition product was obtained in high yield during a low-temperature reaction. When the products from other alkene reactions were compared, it was apparent that 160 single addition products were also obtained with ethene, propene and cyclo- hexene, but multiple addition products were obtained when the alk-1-ene chain contained five or more carbon atoms. The common factor of those alkenes which gave a single product was that on protonation each would give a single carbocation, whereas the larger chain alkenes would give carboca- tions which were capable of rearrangement to give alternative secondary carbocations. The overall mechanism must therefore involve the intermediacy of carbocations. These can theoretically be produced either by protonation or by the involvement of a Lewis acid site in the clay. As it has been well established that the interlamellar region of these sheet silicates contains protons of high acidity [9], it seems reasonable to propose a protonic mechanism for these reactions. The overall mechanism for most of these reactions can therefore be formulated as in Scheme 1, where protonation is followed by nucleophilic attack and finally by explusion of proton.

Overall reaction mechanism developed for hex-1-ene as the reactant. The intermediacy of carbocations can explain the high yields of products obtained from 2,2-dialkylalkenes at lower temperatures because of the facile production of the stabilised tertiary carbocations, and the multiple products from the long-chain alk-1-enes because of carbocation rearrange- ments. Carbocation intermediates can also account for the alkene isomerisa- tion and oligomerisation that were observed in the high-temperature ester reactions. The failure of amines to add to the alkenes can be explained because of the much higher basisity of the amines, which would compete very favour- ably for the available protons, so that little if any alkene protonation would occur with the result that there would be very few carbocations for the amine to react with. 161 The anomolous production of alk-l-yl addition products with thiols has been studied, and it is probable that this is due to the participation of free radical intermediates, common in thiol chemistry, which enable some anti- Markownikov addition to take place. Indeed, the alk-l-yl thioether is the sole product when the reaction is carried out in the absence of the clay catalyst, and when the clay is added much of the reaction changes over to a carbocation mechanism to yield the expected alk-2-yl and alk-3-yl thioethers [5]. The addition of the intercalated water is of interest as it is astonishing that this reaction occurs at all, for five different reactants (two molecules of alkene, two protons and one molecule of water) have to come together in the interiamellar region for this to proceed; and the water is present to only about 8% of the weight of the clay (Scheme 2).

Dimerisation of ethylene oxide: formation of dioxygen heterocycles Another type of addition reaction which is catalysed by ion-exchanged montmorillonites is the dimerisation of ethylene oxide. High yields of 1,4-dioxan (65%) and 2-methyl-l,3-dioxolane (13%) were obtained by reac- tion of ethylene oxide with Al^-exchanged montmorillonite for 30 min at 100 C. The dioxolane appears to be a secondary product which increases in yield at the expense of the dioxan in prolonged reactions [10], and a simple carbocation rearrangement can account for this phenomenon. 162 0 / \\ CHz-CHz H+ interlamellar \"^ CH;-CH, W1 CHi / CH2 CH;, CH; CHa 0 H-0+ -H+ / \\ ' CH^ GHz CHo CH^ \"-o H-0:- CH, CH2-CH2-0-CH2 primary carbocation 0 /\\ -^ CH; CH-CHa CHa-O H-O H-0: CH, CH-CHa CH^-O CH2-CH2-0 secondary carbocation Addition to carbonyl compounds: acetal formation Alcohols add to aldehydes or ketones in the presence of ion-exchanged montmorillonites to give acetals at moderate temperatures [11].

At higher temperatures, the conversion was improved for acetophenone reacted with ethylene glycol in the presence of Al^-exchanged montmorillonite in refluxing benzene to give an almost quantitative yield of the ethylene ketal. In the presence of trimethyl orthoformate the formation of acetals was very fast. On addition of Al^-exchanged montmorillonite to a mixture of anisaldehyde and trimethyl orthoformate at room temperature, an exother- mic reaction took place which resulted in an almost quantitative yield of the acetal in a 10 min reaction [11].

Minor amounts of the alkene and alkene-derived ethers were also observed. For example, propan-1-ol reacted with Al^-exchanged montmorillonite in a 4 h reaction at 200 C to yield di(prop-l-yl) ether (67%), prop-1-yl, prop-2-yl ether (8%) and propene (2%). R-CH^-OH montmorillonite R-CH7-0-CH,-R + H,0 The primary diol, ethylene glycol, reacted with ion-exchanged mont- morillonites at 200 C to give a mixture of the cyclic ether, dioxan and oligomeric ethers [10]. Secondary and tertiary alcohols underwent preferential intramolecular dehydration to the corresponding alkenes with very little ether formation [3,12]. Any suggested mechanism for this intermolecular dehydration must clearly avoid the intermediacy of carbocations or alkenes, as the major products were di(alk-l-yl) ethers and not the branched ethers which would have been expected by Markownikov addition. Clearly an unprotonated alcohol molecule must displace water from a protonated alcohol molecule in an Sy,2 substitution reaction as outlined in Scheme 3. The minor ether is derived from the alkene.

The product was identified as a poly(phenylene methylene) with a molecular weight range up to 250 000 daltons. The formation of the product can be rationalised as in Scheme 4, where the water is displaced by attack of the activated ortho- or para-positions of a neighbouring activated benzene ring acting as the nucleophile [3, 12].

Conversion of thiols to thioethers Primary aliphatic thiols reacted cleanly with ion-exchanged montmoril- lonites at 220 C to yield the corresponding di(alk-l-yl) thioether by displacement of hydrogen sulphide [13]. The conversion rate was slow so that, for example, after 24 h reaction 75% of propane-1-thiol was recovered unchanged. Very little intramolecular elimination of hydrogen sulphide took place. Al3'1' R-CH2 SH > R-CHz-S-CHs-R + ii^S montmorillonite The reaction with secondary thiols was considerably faster, and, in contrast to the result with secondary alcohols, produced good yields of secondary thioethers with very little intramolecular elimination of hydrogen sulphide to the alkenes. Benzyl thiol reacted in exactly the same manner as benzyl alcohol and yielded the same polymer, poly(phenylene methylene) [5]. A novel reaction took place between thiophenol and the ion-exchanged sheet silicates, for although phenol and aniline did not react, thiophenol gave good yields of both diphenyl sulphide and benzene at 200 C [5]. The latter product 165 corresponds to the elimination of elemental sulphur and this interesting reac- tion is being investigated further. Conversion of amines into alky lamines Primary amines reacted very cleanly with a variety of ion-exchanged montmorillonites in a slow reaction at 220 C to yield secondary amines by intermolecular elimination of ammonia [14]. Al^ R-CH2 -NH2 > R-CH2-NH-CH2-R + NH3 montmonllonite Alk-2-yl amines and cycloalkyi amines reacted much faster to give good yields of di(alk-2-yl) amines and dicycloalkyi amines. There was no evidence of any intramolecular elimination of ammonia to give alkenes. The reactions were very temperature-dependent, and the yield of dicyclohexylamine in a 24 h reaction rose from 5% at 160 C to 60% at 220 C [4]. The intermolecular elimination mechanism for these amine reactions is considered to be proton-catalysed and identical to those observed with alcohols and thiols. Kindler et al. [15], Winaus and Adkins [16] and Yoshimura et al. [17] have suggested an oxidation/reduction mechanism for the production of secondary amines from primary amines over nickel and palladium surfaces. The proposed oxidation/reduction mechanism has key steps of dehydrogenation to an imine, coupling with an amine, followed by elimination of ammonia to give a Schiffs' base, which is finally hydrogenated. However, as the clay-catalysed reaction proceeds well with Al3\"1\"-, H\"^-, NI-^- and Cr^-exchanged montmorillonites, it seems improbable that the final hydrogenation step could take place in this case in the absence of traditional transition metal hydrogenation catalysts. Very small amounts of the Schiffs' bases are, however, often observed, so that it seems that there is a small potential for the dehydrogenation and coupling steps to occur with sheet silicate catalysts.

The cyclic secondary amine, pyrrolidine, was also found to eliminate ammonia in the presence of ion-exchanged montmorillonites, but in this case three molecules of pyrrolidine are involved in the elimination step (Scheme 5). The intermediate nature of compound I was established, as in prolonged reactions the yield of compound II increased at the expense of compound I [14]. Conclusion Ion-exchanged montmorillonites have been shown to be efficient heterogeneous catalysts for a wide range of organic reactions. Their mode of action seems to be, in the main, due to interlamellar acidity. They have considerable advantages over conventional homogeneous acid catalysts, as the products can be obtained after simple removal of the catalyst by filtra- tion or centrifugation, or by the use of a flow system. Some of the organic reactions which were found to take place in the sheet silicates were unknown in solution chemistry, because of the presence in the sheet silicate of both protonated and unprotonated reactants in a micro-environment which facilitated intermolecular reactions. In general, the types of organic reactions which took place in the sheet silicates were different from those commonly carried out with zeolite catalysts.

        "dc:description": "Although montmorillonites have been found to have little catalytic activity in their natural Na+ form, various cation-exchanged montmorillonites have proved to be effective catalysts for a wide variety of organic reactions. Alkenes can be induced to add (a) water, (b) alcohols, (c) thiols and (d) carboxylic acids to furnish ethers, thioethers and esters in the presence of these cation-exchanged sheet silicates, but amines failed to undergo addition with alkenes under similar conditions. The number of products obtained in each reaction depended upon the ease of rearrangement of the carbocation intermediates. High yields were obtained in those cases where a single carbocation intermediate was involved. The cation-exchanged sheet silicates also catalysed a variety of elimination reactions. Water was eliminated from alcohols to produce ethers, ammonia was eliminated from amines to make secondary amines and hydrogen sulphide was eliminated from thiols to give dialkyl sulphides. Cation-exchanged bentonites were also effective catalysts in the production of dioxan from ethylene oxide and in the preparation of acetals with orthoformates. Analysis of the products from the reactions suggested that the cation-exchanged montmorillonites reacted, in nearly all cases, as acidic heterogeneous catalysts.",
