The reaction was carried out between 410 and 650 K. The conversion of nH is strongly inhibited in the presence of MCH, which remains the most abundant reactant adsorbed on the metal particles. Neither the activity, nor the selectivity for MCH conversion, were modified by the presence of nH in the feed. During MCH conversion, the dehydrogenation to toluene is the only reaction observed on Pt catalysts. On Ir and Ru catalysts, ring opening and deep hydrogenolysis to lower alkanes operate, the extent of which depends on the metal and the size of the particles.

Introduction When processing feedstocks containing different compounds such as alkanes, naphthenes, aromatics, etc., the competitive reaction between each of them is a key point. Thus, the hydroisomerisation of C4-C5 alkanes on Pt/mordenite can be hindered by the presence of aromatics which poison partially both the acidic and * Corresponding author. t Present address: Institut de Recherches sur la Catalyse, 2 avenue A.

Walter et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 133 (1995) 95-102 the metallic functions [ 1,2]. Conversely, the hydrodecyclisation of polycyclona- phthenes to alkylnaphthenes, or alkanes, could be modified by the presence of alkanes. This last reaction may become important in the future when trying to increase the cetane number of 'gas-oil'. Indeed, patents claim partial hydrodecy- clisation of the naphthenes produced after hydrogenation of polycyclic aromatics on PtPd/NaHY [3,4]. It is also well known from the works of Gault and co- workers [5,6] that the Pt particle size greatly influences the hydrogenolysis of methylcyclopentane: small particles promote non-selective ring opening to n-hex- ane and methylpentanes, whereas large particles catalyse the selective ring opening to methylpentanes alone. Therefore, it was of interest to investigate the competitive reaction between methylcyclohexane and n-hexane with hydrogen on a series of alumina-supported Pt, Ru and Ir catalysts of dispersions varying from 10 to 100%. 2. Experimental The catalysts were prepared from \"y-Al203 (Rh6ne Poulenc, SBET = 200 m2 g- ~, C1 < 20 ppm) and metal 2,4-pentanedionates by ligand exchange according to procedures described by Boitiaux et al. [7]. A toluene or tetrahydrofuran solution of the precursor was contacted with the dehydrated support for 72 h, after which time the ligand exchange was complete. The solution was then either filtered or the solvent was evaporated. After drying under vacuum at 333 K the resulting solids were subjected to different thermal treatments as outlined in Table 1. More details on the preparation of the Pt and Ru catalysts are given elsewhere [ 8,9]. The catalysts were characterized by H2 chemisorption and transmission electron microscopy. The chemisorption of hydrogen was carried out in a conventional volumetric apparatus in the 0-20 kPa pressure range, at 298 K for Pt and Ir, and at 373 K for Ru. The sample was first reactivated in situ under flowing hydrogen at Table 1 Main characteristics for the preparation of alumina-supported Pt, Ir and Ru catalysts Catalyst Metal Thermal treatments H/Me dp TEM (wt.-) Calcination Reduction (nm) PtXI 1.4 Air, 623 K, 4 h, ramp: 1 K/min H2/N2 (20/80), 623 K, 4 h, ramp: 0.5 0.99 1.2 K/min PtlV 2.2 Hz/HzO (97.5/2.5), 973 K, 16 h 0.09 12.0 lr7 0.3 N2, 393 K, 4 h, ramp: 0.5 K/min.

The linear part of the isotherm, usually between 10 and 20 kPa, was extrapolated to zero pressure to determine the hydrogen uptake. The size of the metallic particles was checked by transmission electron microscopy using a Jeol 100CX apparatus. The agreement with the chemisorption results was generally satisfactory. The chemical compositions of the solids were determined after dissolution by elemental analysis at the Service Central d'Analyse (CNRS, Solaize, FRANCE). The main characteristics of the catalysts are presented in Table 1. The reaction of methylcyclohexane (MCH, Fluka A.G., > 99%) and n-hexane (nil, Carlo Erba, > 99%), alone or in a 1/1 mixture, with hydrogen (AGA, high purity grade > 99.99%) was carried out in a dynamic glass reactor. As pure reactant, or in mixture, the partial pressure of both MCH and nH was maintained at 1.2 kPa. The effluents were analyzed by sampling on-line to a FID gas chromatograph equipped with a J & W capillary column (60 m X 0.5 mm I.D., DB 1 apolar bonded phase). An aliquot of the catalyst, typically 100 mg, was reactivated in situ by reduction in flowing hydrogen (20 cm3 min- J ) up to 623 K (ramp: 1 K min- 1 ), maintaining it at this temperature for 3.5 h before cooling down to the initial reaction temperature (413 K). The typical range of reaction temperatures studied was 413-650 K, depending on the activity of the sample. The protocol for the catalytic tests was as following: the MCH was first processed, then nil, and finally the one to one MCH/ nH mixture. During the test, the reaction temperature was increased at 0.5 K min- ~, then decreased at the same rate to the initial value. The catalyst was regenerated at 673 K under pure hydrogen overnight between each reactant conversion. The following parameters were evaluated: n t/ Conversion (mol-%) = (y'(i/n)Ci)/(C~+ ~(i/n)Ci) x 100 1 I Selectivity Si to compound i: /1 Si (mol-%) :Ci/(Efi) X 100 1 where Ci is the mole percent of product with i carbon atoms and is C,the mole percent in the feed ofMCH (n=7) or nH (n=6). 3. Results and discussion Some deactivation occurred between the increasing and the decreasing ramps during the catalytic tests. The extent of this deactivation was low on small Pt and Ir particles, but more important for large Ru particles. Actually, this phenomenon 98 C.G.

Therefore, all the catalytic data presented below were collected during the increasing reaction temperature ramp. In the reaction of MCH with hydrogen, toluene, ring opening products (ROPs: n-heptane ( nC7) + 2-methylhexane (2MH) + 3-methyhexane (3MH)) and lower alkanes are formed (Table 2). In the reaction of nH with hydrogen, single hydro- genolysis to Cj + C5, C2 + C4 and C3, deep hydrogenolysis to lower alkanes, as well as isomerisation to 2MP and 3MP occur, with a small amount of cyclisation products at high temperature. The selectivity for these different compounds depends on the metal and the dispersion of the catalyst. It can be pointed out that the major product of MCH conversion on Pt is toluene. The other salient point is that Ru gives mainly deep hydrogenolysis, with small amounts of toluene from MCH. Ir exhibits an intermediate behaviour. On both Ru and Ir catalysts the extent of deep hydrogen- olysis decreases as the size of metal particle decreases.

Whatever the particle size, the activity for ring opening and/or hydrogenolysis (C- C bond cleavage) decreases in the sequence: Ru > Ir > Pt. This is in perfect agreement with the general considerations about the hydrogenolytic activity of the transition metals [6,10,11 ]. Moreover, large Ir and Ru particles are more active than the smaller ones; this is not the case for Pt. There is now much evidence to show that in many reactions of alkanes with H2, the turnover frequency is dependent on metal particle size [ 12], and more specifically for alumina-supported Ru cata- lysts [ 13,14]. It was suggested that this structure sensitivity may be due in part to variations in the strength of H2 chemisorption [ 15 ]. For all the samples, when converting the mixture of MCH and nil, the rate of reaction for the naphthenic compound remains nearly the same, but the conversion of nH decreases. It is clear that the adsorption of nH on the metal surface is strongly 40 8 2O 0 400 450 500 $80 C.G.

This behaviour increases accord- ing to the sequence Ru < Ir < Pt. As far as the conversion of MCH is concerned, the selectivity pattern remains the same when MCH is processed as pure reactant or in mixture with nil.

Under these reaction conditions, MCH dehydrogenation is the only reaction observed on Pt, with toluene and MCH proportions corresponding to the values expected at the thermodynamic equilib- rium.

The competition between nH and MCH, or toluene which is in thermodynamic equilibrium with MCH, is highly unfavourable to nH which then cannot be adsorbed. On the contrary, with Ir and specially Ru catalysts, the selectivity to toluene remains far from that expected from the thermodynamic equilibrium. It is worth noting that hydrogenolysis occurs to a larger extent with these metals, whereas no opening of the cyclohexane ring was observed on Pt catalysts. Actually, nET, 2MH and 3MH are observed as primary products of MCH ring opening on Ir and particularly on Ru, but only at low conversions. As soon as the conversion increases, deep hydrogenolysis of these alkanes occurs without desorption of the alkyl fragments (Fig. 5), as found for nH conversion. This effect is particularly true with large Ru particles. Table 3 gives for Ir and Ru catalysts the distribution among the ROPs: nCT/2MH/3MH at 540 K. For a statistical cleavage of the endocyclic C-C bonds we should have a 1 / 1 / 1 (nC7 / 2MH/3MH) distribution (non-selective mechanism). It is clear that the ring opening mechanism is mostly selective (cleavage of CH2-CH2 bonds only) and especially on Ru catalysts. The particle size does not seem to have any clear influence on the nature ( selective or non-selective) of the ring opening mechanism. This is also in agreement with the selective character of methylcyclopentane ring opening on Ru/A1203 [9] and Ir/A1203 [16]. If the rate of hydrogenolysis was simply determined by the probability of CHa-CH2 bonds splitting, MCH should react faster than nil; this is not observed experimentally. Moreover, it can be remarked that the MCH conversion produces toluene, not obtained in the nH conversion, which can also participate in the inhibition of the reaction. In conclusion, the competitive conversion of nH and MCH under hydrogen shows that: 1. The presence of nH in the feed does not affect either the reactivity or the selectivity for the conversion of MCH, which remains the most abundant reactant on the metal surface. 2. Whatever the particle size of Pt catalysts, the only observed reaction is the dehydrogenation to toluene. 3. Some opening of the MCH ring occurs on Ir and Ru catalysts. The ROP selec- tivity can approach 50% on small Ru particles and low conversion. The ring opening is essentially selective. 102 C.G.

        "dc:description": "The conversion of methylcyclohexane (MCH), n-hexane (nH) or a 1/1 mixture of the two hydrocarbons was studied over alumina-supported Pt, Ir and Ru catalysts with metal dispersions varying from 10 to 100%, and prepared from the acetylacetonate precursors. The reaction was carried out between 410 and 650 K. The conversion of nH is strongly inhibited in the presence of MCH, which remains the most abundant reactant adsorbed on the metal particles. Neither the activity, nor the selectivity for MCH conversion, were modified by the presence of nH in the feed. During MCH conversion, the dehydrogenation to toluene is the only reaction observed on Pt catalysts. On Ir and Ru catalysts, ring opening and deep hydrogenolysis to lower alkanes operate, the extent of which depends on the metal and the size of the particles.",
