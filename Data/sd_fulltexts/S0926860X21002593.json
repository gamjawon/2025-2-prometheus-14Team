The Pd dispersion was estimated based on the surface Pd content of 0.5 wt%. The amount of Pd atoms exposed at the surface was measured by pulsed CO chemisorption.

Graphical abstract Methane upgrading into more valuable chemicals has been a promising challenge. It was previously reported that highly oxidized Pd/CeO2 could produce ethane from methane. Here, we enhanced the ethane productivity by controlling oxygen mobility of the catalyst support and adding water adsorbents. Pd/Ce1-xPdxO2-y catalyst, in which Pd atom was doped at the ceria support, showed enhanced oxygen activation and oxygen transfer, improving the ethane productivity from 0.04 molC2H6/mmolSurfacePd/h in Pd/CeO2 to 0.57 molC2H6/mmolSurfacePd/h in Pd/Ce1-xPdxO2-y. In order to remove the water produced from methane oxidation, zeolite 13X was physically mixed with Pd/Ce1-xPdxO2-y. The water adsorbent could increase the ethane production significantly, especially at low temperatures. The ethane yield of 0.30 % could be obtained at 290 °C using gaseous O2 as an oxidant. This work can provide useful ways to enhance the yield of value-added products in oxidative methane conversion. Keywords Methane Ethane Oxygen transfer Water adsorbent Heterogeneous catalyst 1 Introduction The direct conversion of methane to value-added chemicals has high industrial potential as an efficient route using natural gas or shale gas [1–3]. This process has received much attention, but direct methane conversion has been very difficult [4]. Non-oxidative route to convert methane to C2/C3 chemicals and aromatics requires high reaction temperature (> 1000 °C), necessitating huge energy use [5–7]. Oxidative methane conversion to produce ethane and ethylene has been reported using O2 as an oxidant, typically allowing lower reaction temperature (> 700 °C) [8,9]. However, various side-products were formed together due to radicals produced at such high temperatures. The poor selectivity causes additional cost for separation [10]. We previously showed that highly oxidized Pd/CeO2 catalysts can catalyze oxidative methane conversion into ethane below 400 °C [11]. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation results showed that the PdOPd sites, not PdOCe, enabled the oxidative methane coupling. Although the PdOCe sites preferred subsequent CH bond cleavage, eventually leading to CO2 formation, the CeO2 support was still required because it helped the Pd domain to maintain a highly oxidized state in spite of reductive methane flow. However, the maximum ethane yield obtained in the Pd/CeO2 catalysts was below 0.1 %. When ethane production was monitored for various concentrations of methane and O2, the ethane production was saturated at low O2 concentrations on the Pd/CeO2 catalyst, whereas the ethane production increased linearly up to high concentrations of methane. It indicates that O2 activation is limiting the ethane production. Many CeO2-based composites are known to be an excellent oxygen carrier. CeO2-Fe2O3 showed greater and faster oxygen storage/release property than CeO2 or Fe2O3 [12]. When CeO2 nanoparticles were deposited on Cu(111), they provided a fast oxygen channel for CO oxidation, resulting in higher activity than original Cu(111) [13]. Especially, ceria-based CexM1-xO2-y (M = Cu, Fe, Zr, Ru, Mn, Pd) solid solution, in which other metal atoms are substituted in the ceria lattice, has shown improved oxygen storage or transfer, comparing to original CeO2. Ce0.9Ru0.1O1.94 presented higher oxygen storage capacity (OSC) than CeO2 [14]. Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 showed the reducibility superior to CeO2 or ZrO2 [15]. Ce0.9Fe0.1O2 or Ce1-xCuxO (x = 0.1∼0.3) had oxygen desorption peak at lower temperatures than CeO2 on O2-temperature programmed desorption (TPD) analysis, indicating high oxygen mobility [16,17]. Due to their facile oxygen transfer, the ceria-based solid solutions have been used as a good support to maintain the oxidation state of surface PdO. Pd on MnOx-CeO2 solid solution remained more oxidized during CO oxidation than bare CeO2 support [18]. PdO on kappa-CeZrO, which had better oxygen mobility than tetragonal-CeZrO, showed more stable redox cycle on CH4 and O2 pulse [19]. Pd/Ce1-xPdxO2-y catalysts have shown the improved catalytic performance in CO oxidation [20–22]. Methane oxidation is a highly exothermic reaction, forming hot spots easily within the catalyst bed, which often leads to catalyst degradation. The formation of hot spots can be minimized through thermal dilution by adding an inert diluent along with the catalyst [23–25]. The methane oxidation also produces water, promoting or hindering further reaction. Adding water increased methanol productivity in direct methane oxidation by blocking over-oxidation of methane over CeOx-Cu2O composites [26,27]. CO oxidation on PdO or Pd/Al3O3 catalysts was promoted when water was introduced [28,29]. On the other hand, adding water deactivated Pd/CeO2 catalysts for methane combustion [30,31]. Water retarded CH activation on PdO and oxygen transfer between PdO and support, such as Al2O3 or SnO2, suppressing the methane combustion [32,33]. Removing water during the methane oxidation could increase the yield of the desired product. In this study, Pd/Ce1-xPdxO2-y catalyst was prepared by solution combustion method and used for direct methane oxidation to produce ethane using gaseous O2 in a continuous flow reactor. The oxygen transfer and ethane productivity of Pd/Ce1-xPdxO2-y were compared with those of Pd/CeO2. The hot spots were formed within the catalyst bed, easily degrading the catalyst, and they were minimized by adding diluents. The water, which was formed during the methane oxidation, was removed using zeolite 13X as water adsorbent to increase the ethane yield as much as possible at low temperatures. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Catalyst syntheses Pd/Ce1-xPdxO2-y (x = 0−0.05) catalyst was synthesized by a solution combustion method. [20,34] (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6 (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥ 99.99 %) 1 g was dissolved in 0.8 mL of deionized water. Pd(NO3)2 (Sigma-Aldrich, ≤ 100 %) 9 mg and 340 mg of glycine (C2H5NO2, Sigma-Aldrich, ≥ 99 %) were dissolved in 0.6 mL of deionized water, then this Pd solution was mixed with the Ce solution. The mixture was stirred to make a homogenous solution and moved to an alumina crucible. The crucible was transferred into a furnace maintained at 350 °C. The solution was boiled and burned with a flame to form solid product. The solid was ground in a mortar and calcined at 650 °C for 16 h in air. We named this samples as ‘Pd/CePdO’. The surface Pd was removed by leaching the Pd/CePdO with nitric acid to prepare CePdO support. Specifically, 0.1 g of Pd/CePdO powder was immersed in 5 mL nitric acid (SAMCHUN, 60 %) in a Teflon-coated vessel and the lid was closed to prevent evaporation. The vessel was heated at 250 °C for 1 h. When the temperature decreased to room temperature, the vessel was opened and the powder was washed with a copious amount of deionized water. The remaining solid was dried at 80 °C for 12 h. Pd/CeO2 was prepared using a conventional deposition-precipitation method [11]. First, CeO2 support was synthesized; 1 g of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (Kanto chemical, 99.99 %) was added in 25 mL deionized water and the aqueous ammonia (Duksan, 25∼30 % NH4OH) was injected dropwise into the solution until pH reached ∼8.5. After stirring for 1 h, the solution was filtered with deionized water. The collected precipitate was dried at 80 °C for 10 h. The solid product was calcined at 500 °C for 5 h in air. Then, CeO2 powder 380 mg was dispersed in 5 mL of deionized water. H2PdCl4 solution was obtained by dissolving PdCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99 %) in HCl (SAMCHUN, 35∼37 %) solution with 1: 2 molar ratio. The H2PdCl4 solution containing an appropriate amount of Pd was injected dropwise into the CeO2 solution under rapid stirring. The Na2CO3 solution was introduced together to make the pH of the solution ∼9. The final solution was stirred for 2 h and aged without stirring for 2 h at room temperature. The slurry was filtered with deionized water. The obtained precipitate was dried at 80 °C for 6 h, and the final solid product was calcined at 750 °C for 25 h in air. We named this samples as ‘Pd/CeO2’. 2.2 Catalytic reactions The catalytic performance of the catalysts was examined in a U-shaped quartz glass fixed bed flow reactor at atmospheric pressure. The catalyst 10 mg was placed inside the reactor. The inlet gas was introduced with 6.8 sccm of O2 (99.995 %), 8.4 sccm of N2 (99.999 %), and 90 sccm of CH4 (99.999 %). All data about the catalytic activity were obtained when the temperature was held for 1 h to establish steady-state condition. The product gases (CO2 and C2H6) were analyzed with a gas chromatograph (GC-6100 series, Younglin) with Molecular Sieve 5A and Porapak N columns (Sigma-Aldrich) equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and flame ionization detector (FID). To maximize the ethane yield, Pd/CePdO catalysts were physically mixed with a diluent such as silica (Junsei, Quartz sand), molecular sieves 13X (Thermo Scientific), or calcium oxide (Sigma, anhydrous). C2H6 selectivity, CH4 conversion, and C2H6 yield were estimated with the following equations using molar flow rates: C2H6 selectivity (%) = 2C2H6(out) × (CO2(out) + 2C2H6(out))−1 × 100 CH4 conversion (%) = (CO2(out) + 2C2H6(out)) × CH4(feed) −1 × 100 C2H6 yield (%) = (CH4 conversion × C2H6 selectivity) × 100−1 2.3 Characterizations The actual Pd amount in the catalysts was measured with an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, ThermoFisher Scientific). Specifically, 30 mg of the powder sample was introduced in an open Teflon-coated vessel containing 2.5 mL nitric acid, 2.5 mL hydrogen peroxide and 0.1 mL sulfuric acid. The solution was heated to 180 °C. When the amount of solution decreased, it was cooled to room temperature, 3 mL of nitric acid was added and heated at 180 °C again. The process was repeated to obtain a clear yellow or orange solution in which all the powders were dissolved completely. The crystalline structure was analyzed by powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD, RIGAKU). High angle annular dark field-scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) images and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images were measured using a Titan cubed G2 60 − 300 (FEI) with an accelerating voltage of 300 kV. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was measured at 10 C Wide XAFS beamline of the Pohang Light Source (PLS). The Pd K-edge spectra were observed in a fluorescence mode using a passivated implanted planar silicon (PIPS) detector (Canberra). Each sample was calibrated by measuring the reference Pd foil concurrently. The XAS data were processed and fitted using the ARTEMIS and ATHENA software. A coordination number was calculated by fixing the amplitude reduction factor (S0 2) to the values obtained from the reference Pd foil. The Debye-Waller factor (σ2) was fixed to a reasonable value to 3.0·10−3 in order to limit independent parameters for fitting [35,36]. The oxidation state of Pd was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, K-Alpha, Thermo VG Scientific). The binding energies were calculated using the maximum intensity of the advantageous C 1s signal at 284.8 eV as a reference. Pd dispersion was measured with a pulsed CO adsorption, which was modified from Takeguchi’s method [37]. First, the Pd/CePdO catalyst 30 mg was heated in the 5% O2/He gas at 300 °C for 10 min followed by cooling to 50 °C with He gas for 5 min for purging. The sample was heated in 4.9 % H2/Ar gas to 200 °C for 15 min. After cooling to 50 °C, the catalyst was treated under following conditions; 1) He gas for 5 min, 2) 5% O2/He gas for 5 min, 3) CO2 gas for 10 min, 4) He gas for 20 min, 5) 4.9 % H2/Ar gas for 5 min. CO2 was introduced to form carbonates on ceria surface to avoid overestimating the Pd dispersion. Finally, CO gas was pulsed every 1 min in He stream repeatedly until the adsorption of CO onto the catalyst was saturated. In-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS, Thermo Scientific) was performed with a MCT detector and a diffuse reflectance assembly chamber having a KBr window. The 5 mg sample was mixed with 95 mg KBr powder and pretreated at 100 °C for 1 h under Ar gas flow to remove water and impurities. The mixture was cooled to room temperature and a background spectrum was measured. To observed CO adsorption, 1% CO/Ar gas flowed over the sample for 10 min to saturate CO atmosphere. The spectra were obtained during CO desorption by Ar flow with evacuation for 10 min at room temperature. Finally, adsorbed-CO spectra onto the sample was obtained. O2-temperature programmed desorption (O2-TPD) spectra was performed on a BETCAT-B (BEL, Japan) equipped with high sensitivity TCD. A water trap was used to exclude the signals from water. Each catalyst 0.1 g was pretreated for 30 min at 100 °C in 5% O2/He gas flow and cooled down to 50 °C by purging with He gas flow. The catalyst was exposed to He gas flow for 1 h and stabilized under the flow for 30 min. Then, the temperature increased from 30 to 900 °C with a ramping rate of 10 °C min−1 to obtain O2-TPD spectra. The temperature increased from 30 to 900 °C with a ramping rate of 10 °C min−1. H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) spectra were obtained using BEL-CAT-II (BEL Japan Inc.) equipped with a TCD. Each catalyst 50 mg was heated for 1 h at 200 °C in Ar flow and cooled down to -90 °C using a cryogenic apparatus using liquid nitrogen. Then, the catalysts were exposed to a 4.9 % H2/Ar gas flow and stabilized under the flow for 10 min. The temperature increased from -90 to 600 °C with a ramping rate of 10 °C min−1. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalytic activity of Pd/CePdO and Pd/CeO2 catalysts In our previous work, we showed that Pd/CeO2 catalyst can produce ethane from direct methane oxidation [11]. However, O2 activation was rather poor in the Pd/CeO2 catalyst, limiting the ethane productivity. The Pd/CePdO catalyst was prepared to enhance the O2 activation by using a solution-combustion method. When a high concentration of CH4 (86 %) was introduced with gaseous O2 (6.5 %) at elevated temperature, the C2H6 yield was compared by adjusting the Pd contents of Pd/CePdO to 1, 3.5, 8 wt%. The Pd contents in Pd/CeO2 catalysts was also varied to 1, 4, 8 wt%. The conventional deposition-precipitation method was used to synthesize the Pd/CeO2. The C2H6 yields obtained were shown in Fig. 1 a and b. The 1 wt% Pd/CePdO and 4 wt% Pd/CeO2 showed the highest C2H6 yield of 0.084 % and 0.054 % at 350 °C and 390 °C, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1c. The C2H6 selectivity was also shown in Fig. S1. When the Pd content of Pd/CePdO increased over 1 wt%, large PdO domains were formed, and PdO peak was observed in the XRD patterns as shown in Fig. S2. Turnover frequency for ethane production (TOFC2H6) was estimated per surface Pd atom to compare the catalytic activities on the 1 wt% Pd/CePdO and the 4 wt% Pd/CeO2 as shown in Fig. 1d. The maximum TOFC2H6 could reach 0.57 molC2H6/mmolSurfacePd/h at 350 °C in the 1 wt% Pd/CePdO, while the 4 wt% Pd/CeO2 had the maximum TOFC2H6 value of 0.04 molC2H6/mmolSurfacePd/h at 390 °C. These results show that low-temperature C2H6 production could be much increased in Pd/CePdO catalyst. When the reaction temperature was higher than 350 °C, the C2H6 production suddenly decreased. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results showed that the oxidic state of the surface Pd maintained after the reaction at 350 °C as shown in Fig. S3. But the Pd surface was reduced after the reaction at 430 °C, indicating that C2H6 production did not occur at metallic Pd surface. CO-DRIFT spectra were obtained to observe whether the CePdO support, which was prepared by immersing the 1 wt% Pd/CePdO in nitric acid (60 %) at 250 °C for 1 h, has surface Pd sites, as shown in Fig. S4 [20]. The CO molecules adsorbed onto single Pd sites show a peak at 2000–2200 cm−1, while the CO adsorbed onto ensemble Pd sites show a peak at 1800–2000 cm−1 [38]. The Pd/CePdO clearly showed the peaks for adsorbed CO, but the CePdO support showed no CO peak, indicating that Pd was not exposed at the CePdO support surface. When the Pd content was measured by ICP-OES, it was 0.5 wt% in the CePdO support. Table 1 showed the Pd dispersion, size and BET surface area of the 1 wt% Pd/CePdO and 4 wt% Pd/CeO2. The Pd dispersion and size were estimated based on surface Pd contents (0.5 wt% for Pd/CePdO and 4 wt% for Pd/CeO2). The Pd size was similar as 3.8 nm for the Pd/CePdO and 2.9 nm for the Pd/CeO2. Their TEM images were shown in Fig. S5. The Pd/CePdO has much larger ceria domain than the Pd/CeO2 . The Pd/CePdO catalyst has the surface area of 7.8 m2 g−1, much lower than the Pd/CeO2 with 32.4 m2 g−1. The solid solution synthesized by the solution combustion method usually had low surface area of <10 m2 g−1 [39,40]. EDS mapping image was obtained for the 1 wt% Pd/CePdO catalyst, as shown in Fig. 2 a. Red dots (Pd) were evenly dispersed and several clustered Pd red dots indicated the presence of Pd nanoparticles on the surface of the CePdO support. The structures of the 1 wt% Pd/CePdO and the 4 wt% Pd/CeO2 were compared in Pd K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), as shown in Fig. 2b. Fig. S6 and Table S1 showed the EXAFS fitting results. While the Pd/CeO2 has PdO nanoparticles on CeO2 support, the Pd/CePdO has PdO nanoparticles on CePdO support. Fig. S7 showed X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the Pd/CePdO, Pd/CeO2, CePdO support and CeO2 support. The XRD peaks for only CeO2 phase were observed. The XRD peaks for PdO or Pd are not observed, indicating fine dispersion of Pd species. The shift in the CeO2 XRD peaks upon Pd substitution was not clear in the Pd/CePdO or CePdO, probably due to low Pd content of 0.5 %. Fig. 2c shows the O2-TPD results of 1 wt% Pd/CePdO and 4 wt% Pd/CeO2, indicating the oxygen transfer. The Pd/CePdO showed the oxygen desorption peak at 270 °C while the Pd/CeO2 had the peak at much higher temperature of 620 °C, indicating that the surface oxygen species can be desorbed much more easily on the Pd/CePdO. The lattice oxygen started to be desorbed at 450°C in the Pd/CePdO catalyst. The change in oxygen vacancy sites was investigated using Ce 3d and O 1s XPS on the Pd/CePdO and Pd/CeO2, as shown in Fig. S8. The Ce 3d XPS peaks were deconvoluted and the percentages of Ce3+ and Ce4+ were estimated from the peak area ratio. The ratio of Ce3+ was higher in the Pd/CePdO (15.1 %) and CePdO (16.5 %) than Pd/CeO2 (9.7 %) and CeO2 (10.4 %). The higher Ce3+ ratio indicates more oxygen vacancy sites, resulting in higher oxygen activation [20,41,42]. Similarly, O 1s XPS peaks were also deconvoluted to lattice oxygen (Olatt) and surface oxygen adsorbed on the defect sites (Oads). The Pd/CePdO had more Oads than Pd/CeO2, with 27.8 % versus 19.8 %. The Pd/CePdO possesses more surface oxygen species. The H2-TPR results in Fig. 2d show that PdO nanoparticles were reduced to Pd metal at 60 °C in the Pd/CePdO. A shoulder at higher temperatures (∼110 °C) was ascribed to the reduction of Pd2+ in the lattice of CeO2 on Pd/CePdO catalyst [43,44]. PdO nanoparticles deposited on CeO2 showed the reduction peak at lower temperature of 30 °C. These results inform that the oxidic Pd was preserved better on the Pd/CePdO under reductive condition. In our previous work, the oxidic PdOPd sites are the active sites to produce C2H6 at low temperature [11]. The Pd/CePdO could maintain the oxidic PdOPd better than the Pd/CeO2, resulting in better C2H6 productivity. The effect of CH4 and O2 content was examined on the Pd/CePdO and Pd/CeO2 as shown in Fig. S9. The C2H6 productivity increased linearly as the CH4 content increased on both Pd/CePdO and Pd/CeO2 catalyst, indicating that CH4 was easily activated on the catalysts. The C2H6 productivity became saturated as the O2 content increased on the Pd/CeO2, whereas the C2H6 productivity kept increasing on the Pd/CePdO. Clearly, better oxygen activation and better oxygen transfer on the Pd/CePdO catalyst could increase the C2H6 production. 3.2 Effect of thermal dilution It was attempted to increase the C2H6 production further by controlling the reaction condition. The C2H6 yield and TOFC2H6 were observed by controlling the catalyst weight from 5 mg to 100 mg, as shown in Fig. 3 . When the amount of Pd/CePdO catalysts increased, the C2H6 production stopped at earlier temperature. When 100 mg of the Pd/CePdO catalyst was used, the catalyst stopped working at 290 °C. This sudden stop in the ethane production was due to the catalyst reduction [11]. Because methane oxidation is highly exothermic, a large amount of reaction heat is generated from the catalytic reaction, creating a hot spot with a large thermal gradient in the catalyst bed [23,24]. When the hot spots are formed, the catalyst could be easily degraded, resulting in low C2H6 production rate. The temperature difference between the reactor temperature with and without the catalyst was measured for various amounts of the Pd/CePdO catalysts, as shown in the lower figure in Fig. 3a. Fig. 3b shows TOFC2H6 estimated for the various catalyst amounts, plotted versus the actual catalyst temperature. TOFC2H6 was nearly the same irrelevant to the catalyst amount, but the catalyst was degraded at lower temperatures as the catalyst amount increased. Silica sand was used as a diluent to buffer the thermal gradient on oxidative methane conversion, as shown in Fig. 3c and d. The highest C2H6 yield increased from 0.02 % to 0.18 % for 100 mg catalyst, from 0.09 % to 0.16 % for 50 mg catalyst, and from 0.09 % to 0.12 % for 25 mg catalyst when each Pd/CePdO catalyst was physically mixed with 15 g of silica diluent. The 5 and 10 mg Pd/CePdO catalysts showed the similar C2H6 yield when diluted with silica sand, indicating that the 5 mg or 10 mg of the catalyst would not form the hot spots much. Fig. S10 showed that the C2H6 selectivity was hardly affected by the silica diluent. Fig. S11 also showed that the C2H6 selectivity had little dependency on the space velocity. TOFC2H6 kept increasing at higher temperature in Fig. 3d, although the larger catalyst amounts still showed some deviation from the case of 5 mg or 10 mg. The deviation implies that there might be another factor suppressing the C2H6 production. It has been reported that water can inhibit CH activation on PdO and oxygen transfer between PdO and the support of Al2O3 or SnO2 [32,33]. The water effect is investigated in the next section. 3.3 Effect of water adsorbents Fig. 4 a shows that the C2H6 yield decreased when water introduced into reactant feed flow. Surely, water inhibits the C2H6 production, resulting in low C2H6 yield below 400 °C. In order to remove water, which is formed during methane oxidation, zeolite 13X was used as a water adsorbent. Instead of silica sand, zeolite 13X was mixed with the Pd/CePdO catalyst. Fig. 4b shows TGA result of zeolite 13X, showing that most of the adsorbed water would be removed at 400 °C. The zeolite 13X was mixed with the Pd/CePdO catalyst, then treated at 200, 300, or 400 °C. No C2H6 was produced on zeolite 13X only. The C2H6 yield surely increased upon mixing with zeolite 13X, especially at low temperatures. The C2H6 selectivity also increased as shown in Fig. S12. Removing water using zeolite adsorbents was not very efficient at high temperatures, though, because the water sorption capacity was much smaller. The maximum C2H6 yield obtained increased slightly from 0.27 % to 0.32 % at 370 °C upon mixing with zeolite 13X. To maximize the removal of water using zeolite adsorbents and the C2H6 yield, it was attempted to lower the reaction temperature as much as possible by diluting the CH4 concentration. Fig. 4d shows that C2H6 yield at 290 °C increased from 0.11 % for the reactant flow of CH4/O2 73 %/18 % (balance N2) to 0.30 % for CH4/O2 1.5 %/0.38 % (balance N2). In-situ mass spectra (MS) were measured to observe the signal of products (C2H6, CO2, H2O) over the physical mixture of 1 wt% Pd/CePdO catalyst and silica sand or zeolite 13X at 310 °C, as shown in Fig. 5 . When the Pd/CePdO catalyst was physically mixed with silica sand, all the C2H6, CO2 and H2O signals were simultaneously measured during the direct methane oxidation. When mixed with zeolite 13X, however, the H2O production signal was delayed while the signals of C2H6 and CO2 increased significantly at initial stage (∼0.3 h). It clearly shows that the H2O produced during the reaction was adsorbed on zeolite 13X, leading to H2O-free condition with higher C2H6 production. The C2H6 yield obtained in this work was compared with the literature values, as shown in Table 2 . The production of valuable chemicals, such as C2H6, dimethyl ether (DME) and methanol (MeOH), from direct methane oxidation has been reported using continuous gas-phase reactor below 400 °C. The product yields were lower than 0.1 % in the most literatures. We could further control the apparent C2H6 selectivity using CaO as an absorbent, as shown in Fig. S13. CaO has been reported to absorb both H2O and CO2 [45]. The C2H6 yield on the mixture of 1 wt% Pd/CePdO and CaO was lower than the mixture with zeolite 13X, but the C2H6 could be obtained with 100 % selectivity because the side product CO2 was absorbed onto the CaO. The C2H6 production on the physical mixture of 1 wt% Pd/CePdO and zeolite 13X was tested for long-term reaction, as shown in Fig. 6 . Both high and low methane concentrations (73 % CH4 and 1.5 % CH4) were tested at 370 °C and 290 °C, respectively. The C2H6 yield decreased from 0.32 % to 0.24 % after 50 h of reaction at 370 °C. This is mainly due to the poisoning from water produced during the reaction. The catalyst bed was regenerated by treating at 500 °C for 2 h under air flow, then the initial C2H6 yield was recovered. Fig. S14 shows the mass spectra obtained during the regeneration step. The desorbed water was clearly observed. The water poisoning effect was more dominant for the long-term reaction at low methane concentration. The C2H6 yield decreased from 0.30 % to 0.14 % after 50 h of reaction at 290 °C. The initial yield was also recovered after the regeneration step. When C2H6 production rate was compared, the high methane concentration flow could produce ethane stably with ∼0.1 mmolC2H6/h at 370 °C, while the production rate was much lower as ∼0.001 mmolC2H6/h at 290 °C for the low methane concentration flow. 4 Conclusions The Pd/Ce1-xPdxO2-y catalyst was compared with the Pd/CeO2 catalyst for direct methane oxidation using O2 in a continuous gas-phase reactor. The Pd/Ce1-xPdxO2-y could produce C2H6 more than the Pd/CeO2 with much higher turnover frequency. The O2-TPD and H2-TPR results confirmed that the Pd/Ce1-xPdxO2-y catalyst has enhanced oxygen transfer, preserving surface oxidic Pd better than the Pd/CeO2 catalyst. The hot spots, which were formed during highly exothermic methane oxidation, degraded the catalysts easily, thus the diluent should be mixed with the Pd/Ce1-xPdxO2-y catalyst to increase the C2H6 yield. Water produced during the methane oxidation also behaved as poisoning species against C2H6 production. Zeolite 13X was added to remove the water and also as a diluent. Mass spectra clearly showed that C2H6 production was promoted by removing the poisoning effect of water. The C2H6 could be produced stably with a rate of ∼0.1 mmolC2H6/h at 370 °C and ∼0.001 mmolC2H6/h at 290 °C. The use of a different diluent, such as CaO, enabled the production of C2H6 only by absorbing CO2 selectively. This work demonstrates an interesting example to increase the ethane production in direct methane oxidation at low temperatures. CRediT authorship contribution statement G. Kwon and H.

        "dc:description": "Methane upgrading into more valuable chemicals has been a promising challenge. It was previously reported that highly oxidized Pd/CeO2 could produce ethane from methane. Here, we enhanced the ethane productivity by controlling oxygen mobility of the catalyst support and adding water adsorbents. Pd/Ce1-xPdxO2-y catalyst, in which Pd atom was doped at the ceria support, showed enhanced oxygen activation and oxygen transfer, improving the ethane productivity from 0.04 molC2H6/mmolSurfacePd/h in Pd/CeO2 to 0.57 molC2H6/mmolSurfacePd/h in Pd/Ce1-xPdxO2-y. In order to remove the water produced from methane oxidation, zeolite 13X was physically mixed with Pd/Ce1-xPdxO2-y. The water adsorbent could increase the ethane production significantly, especially at low temperatures. The ethane yield of 0.30 % could be obtained at 290 °C using gaseous O2 as an oxidant. This work can provide useful ways to enhance the yield of value-added products in oxidative methane conversion.",
