Cu-based catalysts have been extensively studied to enhance the performance of the electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3–RR), while it is still a challenge to balance high ammonia (NH3) current density and Faradaic efficiency. Here, we incorporated nitrogen coordinated iron single atom catalyst (FeNC) with copper phthalocyanine (CuPc), denoted as CuPc/FeNC, for NO3–RR. Compared with the two individual catalysts, this two-component catalyst increases NH3 Faradaic efficiency and current density at low overpotentials, achieves efficient synergistic catalytic conversion. Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the enhanced electrochemical performance of CuPc/FeNC catalyst comes from the tandem process, in which NO2 – is produced on CuPc and then transferred to FeNC and further reduced to NH3. In this exceptional tandem catalyst system, an outstanding NH3 Faradaic efficiency close to 100% was achieved at potentials greater than –0.35 V vs. RHE, coupled with a peak NH3 partial current density of 273 mA cm–2 at –0.57 V vs. RHE, effectively suppressing NO2 – production across the entire potential range. This strategy provides a design platform for the continued advancement of NO3 –RR catalysts. Graphical Abstract CuPc/FeNC tandem catalyst achieved both high NH3 current density and Faradaic efficiency at low overpotentials for electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction as verified by electrochemical operando spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations.

Despite various remediation techniques being utilized to remove nitrate, large-scale applications are restricted by low-value products and challenging operating conditions [ 5,6 ]. A viable alternative approach is the electrochemical NO3 – reduction reaction to produce NH3, which not only facilitates the removal of nitrate with moderate operating conditions but also can be a promising pathway for renewable NH3 production [ 7 ]. NH3 is considered as a promising energy carrier with the potential to perform a robust and sustainable role in future energy scenarios [ 3,7,8 ]. However, conventional NH3 synthesis still relies on the Haber-Bosch process, which operates at elevated temperatures and pressures (400–500 °C and 150–300 atm), leading to huge energy consumption and significant carbon emission [ 3,5,7 ]. Over the past few decades, electrochemical N2 reduction has been explored as an alternative approach for NH3 synthesis. Compared with the highly stable N≡N bond (941 kJ mol–1) of N2, the comparatively low N=O bond dissociation energy (204 kJ mol–1) of nitrate makes it a desirable nitrogen source for NH3 production [ 2,7,9–11 ]. However, the NO3 –RR suffers complex reaction pathways involving multiple electron-proton transfer in an alkaline medium (NO3 – + 6H2O + 8e– → NH3 + 9OH–). Of which, the NO3 – undergoes initial hydrogenation to form NO2 –, followed by further reduction until NH3 is produced. Therefore, developing catalysts with high activity, selectivity, and stability for efficient NH3 synthesis is an imperative task. In recent years, Cu-based catalysts, attributed to the special d-orbital electron configurations, have served as model catalysts for NO3 –RR, and the research undergone an upsurge [ 9,12–14 ]. However, the highly negative applied potentials were supplied in the reaction to maintain enough *H coverage for a significant surface hydrogenation rate, which is energetically inefficient. While at low overpotentials, the insufficient *H supply over Cu is the primary limitation on the hydrogenation of NO3 –RR intermediates [ 15,16 ]. Till now, numerous strategies have been explored to boost catalytic activity, such as synthesizing metal alloys from random to ordered alloys [ 12,17 ], utilizing metal salts with different ligands [ 18 ], or minimizing active metal concentration from cluster to single atom [ 16,19,20 ]. However, due to the ubiquitous adsorption-energy scaling limitations, ensuring both high NH3 current density and Faradaic efficiency in equilibrium remains a pressing concern. The metal-phthalocyanine (M-Pc), two-dimensional (2D) material with a planer conjugated array structure, has emerged as highly efficient catalyst [ 21–23 ]. A prior study investigated the performance of CuPc in NO3 –RR and found that the reaction potential could regulate selectivity, effectively reduced NO3 – to NO2 – at low overpotentials [ 24 ]. However, further reducing NO2 – to NH3 still requires a significant overpotential (–0.7 V vs. RHE), which is also susceptible to the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the accumulation of NO2 – [ 4,19,25 ]. Therefore, rational design of catalysts with robust ability is crucial to make NO3 –RR practically realizable. Recently, the close-packed FeNC catalytic centers have been reported to facilitate the NO2 –-binding and multi-electron reduction process, which was widely used for natural cytochrome c nitrite reductase [ 26 ]. Wang et al. [ 7 ] also observed that FeNC active center electrochemically converted NO3 – to NH3, yet the maximum NH3 Faradaic efficiency was only 75%. In order to improve the selectivity and efficiency of NH3 production at relatively low overpotentials, a two-component catalyst may be a desired option to accelerate the tandem process between NO3 – to NO2 – and NO2 – to NH3 [ 27–30 ]. Inspired by these findings, we developed a catalyst combined CuPc and FeNC (denoted as CuPc/FeNC) and investigated its performance in NO3 –RR, which exhibits excellent activity and selectivity towards NH3 production at low overpotentials. At potentials greater than –0.35 V vs. RHE, the NH3 Faradaic efficiency is nearly 100%, and the highest achieved NH3 partial current density reaches 273 mA cm–2 at –0.57 V vs. RHE. The improved performance of CuPc/FeNC catalyst can be attributed to synergistic catalytic conversion through the tandem process (Scheme 1 ). The NO2 – is initially generated on CuPc, and subsequently transports to FeNC, where it undergoes further reduction to yield NH3. The CuPc/FeNC tandem system, which overcomes their individual limitations, such as high overpotential and NO2 – buildup on CuPc and irrepressible HER on FeNC and breaks the adsorption-energy ratio relationship for NO3 –RR. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and chemicals Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (China) provided the zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, > 99%) and 2-methyl imidazole (2-MeIM, 99%). J&K Chemicals was the supplier of ammonium ferric citrate (AFC). Sigma was the source of the copper phthalocyanine (CuPc). Maclin was the supplier of potassium hydroxide (KOH). No additional purification was required for any of the reagents. 2.2 Synthesis of FeNC catalyst FeNC was made using the technique we previously published [ 31 ]. In 400 mL of methanol combined with 10 mL of water containing 30 mg of AFC, 10 mmol Zn(NO3)2·6H2O was dissolved. The aforementioned solution was rapidly stirred vigorously while 100 mL of methanol containing 6.7 g 2-MeIM was added. After obtaining the solution, it was stirred for 1 h and then left motionless for a full day. The product was collected by centrifugation, followed by washing with methanol for three times, and a vacuum-dried 60 °C process. The 400 mg AFC-functionalized ZIF-8 was subjected to heating at 1000 °C in an Ar environment and subsequently allowed to cool naturally to ambient temperature. The obtained black powder was crushed and named as FeNC. 2.3 Gas diffusion electrode (GDE) preparation Firstly, in order to boost the hydrophobic properties of carbon paper, Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, Sigma-Aldrich) was first impregnated into the carbon paper until the mass ratio of PTFE reached 20 wt%. The carbon paper was then calcined for 2 h at 350 °C. Additionally, Vulcan XC-72R carbon black was dispersed in ethanol using ultrasonic treatment before being added to PTFE solutions to create carbon ink. The carbon paper was painted by hand with ink on one side. The last gas diffusion electrode was produced by 2 h of annealing in a muffle furnace. 2.4 Preparation of catalyst ink and the working electrode All catalyst inks were prepared by mixing catalyst with Nafion ionomer solution with a mass ratio of 8:2, then ultrasonically stirring in ethanol for 1 hour, which was drop-casted over carbon paper to prepare the working electrode. The catalyst loading was maintained at 2.5 mg cm–2. As for CuPc/FeNC electrode, the mass ratio of CuPc and FeNC is 2:8. The CuPc/XC-72R electrode has the same proportion of CuPc. XC-72R carbon black was incorporated to enhance the electrode's conductivity because CuPc is an organic semiconductor with relatively poor conductivity. 2.5 Physicochemical characterizations Measurements of X-ray diffraction (XRD) were performed at a scan rate of 5°/min using a PANalytical X’pert PPR diffractometer. Field emission electron microscopy (JSM-7900F) was adopted to complete scanning electron microscopy (SEM) tests. JEM-ARM200F (JEOL, Japan) was used to capture high-annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images. The contents of metal species were performed on inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, ICPS-8100, Shimadzu). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded using a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer. The binding energies were calibrated based on the C 1s feature located at 284.6 eV. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption was recorded with ASAP2020. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were acquired on JEM-2100 instrument. For the characterization of post-reaction catalysts, such as XRD and TEM, the catalysts undergo the same reaction time and applied potential as utilized in the electrochemical performance measurements of NO3 –RR. The operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements were conducted on BL11B beamline at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The metallic Fe foil and Cu foil were used as references for calibrating the energy scale. The data were obtained using the fluorescence-yield mode, and were processed by ATHENA. The operando Raman spectroscopy measurements were carried out on Renishaw Raman and JPK NanoWizard atomic force microscope (AFM) coupling system with 785 nm laser light. 2.6 NO3 –RR measurements The electrochemical assessments were conducted employing a flow cell as detailed in our prior publication [ 31,32 ]. A three-electrode system consisted of a working electrode with the reaction area of 2 cm2, an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and a counter electrode (composed of Ti foam coated with IrO2). The cathode electrolyte consists of 1.0 mol L–1 KOH and 0.2 mol L–1 KNO3, the anode electrolyte was 1.0 mol L–1 KOH and separated by an anion exchange membrane. The flow rates of cathode and anode electrolytes are 3 and 5 mL min–1, respectively. Ar with 5% He was fed into the flow field of the cathode through the GDE into the cathode electrolyte. The electrochemical performance was conducted at room temperature, approximately 25 °C. The duration of reaction for each applied potential exceeds 20 minutes until a stable current was achieved. The cathode potential was universally calibrated to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) with iR correction: E (RHE) = E (Ag/AgCl) + 0.21V + 0.0591V × pH – iR × 85% 2.7 Product analysis Gas and liquid products were assessed using Gas chromatography and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometry, respectively. The Faradaic efficiency (ε Faradaic,i) of product i was determined using the formula: ε Faradaic,i = Q i/Q total × 100 = (N i × n i × F)/Q total ×100 ε Faradaic,i: Faradaic efficiency of product i, %; Q i: the charge consumed for a specific product i, C; Q total: the total consumed charge, C; N i: amount of the product i, mol; n i: number of transferred charge in the product; F: Faradaic constant (96485 C mol–1). 2.8 Determination of liquid product NH3 quantification [ 7 ]. The NH3 concentration was determined using the indophenol blue method. The color reagent A consists of 4 g NaOH, 5 g salicylic acid, and 5 g sodium citrate in 100 mL water (stored at 4 °C). The color reagent B was 0.05 mol L–1 NaClO (stored at 4 °C). 1.0 wt% sodium nitroferricyanide was named as color reagent C. Typically, the electrolyte to be tested was diluted to 2 mL with a blank electrolyte. Then, 2 mL of A, 1 mL of B, and 0.2 mL of C were introduced into the diluted electrolyte for the color reaction. After keeping still in dark for 2 h, the solution was performed with UV-vis spectrophotometry. At a wavelength of 655 nm, the indophenol blue's absorbance was measured. The calibration curve was measured in the same way, except for different concentrations of NH4Cl. NO2 – quantification [ 7 ]. The Griess color agent was prepared by dissolving 4 g sulfonamide, 10 mL H3PO4 (85%), and 0.2 g N-(1-naphthyl) ethyldiamine dihydrochloride in 100 mL water (stored at 4 °C). 3 mL of electrolyte was neutralized by 3 mL HCl (1.0 mol L–1). The aforementioned solution was mixed with 0.1 mL of coloring agent, and the mixed solution was left undisturbed in the dark for 20 min. The absorbance at 540 nm was determined by the concentrations of NO2 –. Different concentrations of KNO2 solutions were used to measure the calibration by the same way. NMR determination of NH3 [ 7 ]. In order to further determine the concentration of NH3, the calibration curve was also measured with 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR, 400 MHz). First, different concentrations of NH4Cl solutions were prepared in 1.0 mol L–1 KOH and 0.2 mol L–1 KNO3. 3.0 mol L–1 HCl was used to bring the pH of the solutions down to 2. Mixing 500 μL above solution into the nuclear tube with 100 μL internal standard, which is 23 mg C4H4O4 dissolved in 5 mL DMSO-d6. The calibration curve was performed by measuring the ratio between NH3 and C4H4O4. Then the concentrations of NH3 in the test were determined in the same way. The concentration of NH3 during NO2 –RR was measured by NMR determination. 2.9 Computational details All calculations were carried out utilizing the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) employing spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) [ 33 ]. The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) form of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was employed to elucidate the exchange-correlation energy of electron interactions [ 34,35 ]. The van der Waals forces were accounted for using the DFT-D3 correction method [ 36 ]. In the process of geometry optimization, the energy convergence threshold was established at 1.0 × 10–5 eV, while the force convergence criterion was set to 0.02 eV Å–1. Brillouin zone sampling was performed using a 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack mesh. Plane waves with a 450 eV cutoff energy were used to expand the electron wave functions. A 15 Å vacuum region was employed to separate neighboring layers of CuPc and FeNC. All DFT-calculated NO3 – electrocatalytic conversion process is conducted at 0 V vs. RHE at pH = 14. In order to mimic the solvate environment, the VASPsol model was employed to account for solvation effects [ 37 ]. The approximate expression for the adsorption energy of NO3 – (ΔG *NO3) is given by: ΔG *NO3 = G *NO3 – G * – G HNO3(g) + 0.5G H2(g) + ΔG correct ΔG correct = –ΔG S1 – ΔG S2 where the Gibbs free energy of NO3 – adsorbed on surface, substrates, HNO3, and H2 molecules in the gas phase are, in turn, represented by G *NO3, G *, G HNO3(g), and G H2. The adsorption energy correction, or ΔG correct, for this task is set at 0.392 eV. The Gibbs free energy (ΔG, 298 K) for each reaction step is performed through: ΔG = ΔE + ΔE ZPE – TΔS where TΔS is the difference in entropy between the gas phase and the adsorbed state, ΔE ZPE is the difference in zero-point energy, and ΔE is the adsorption energy. The catalysts’ HER activity can be assessed using ΔG H, which is defined as: ΔG H = ΔE H + ΔE ZPE – TΔS H, ΔE H is defined as the hydrogen adsorption energy, given by: ΔE H = E (System+ H) – E (System) – 0.5E H2, E (System+ H) and E (System) represent the energies of the entire research system with and without hydrogen adsorption, respectively. ΔE ZPE refers to the change in zero-point energy in the overall system, and T is set at 298 K. ΔS H represents the entropy change of the hydrogen atom as it transitions from the gaseous to the adsorbed state. In this context, ΔE ZPE – TΔS H is approximated as 0.24 eV [ 38 ]. The elementary steps of various pathways are shown in supporting information. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of FeNC catalyst and working electrode The Fe content in FeNC was quantified as 1.0 wt% through inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy. The diffraction peaks of amorphous carbon were obtained by XRD and no metal peak appeared (Fig. S1). Fig. S2 further displays the observation of the amorphous carbon structure of FeNC through TEM. XPS was conducted to the analysis of the chemical composition and structure of FeNC. The appearance of the metal-nitrogen peak at 399.6 eV and the oxidation state of the Fe species (Fig. S3) confirm the formation of Fe-N coordination [ 39 ]. HRTEM images reveal the presence of porous graphitic carbon, with no discernible metal nanoparticles in FeNC (Fig. 1(a) ). By using HAADF-STEM, the isolated metal in FeNC was observed to be dispersed on the porous amorphous carbon framework (Fig. 1(b)). The Fe K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra of FeNC exhibits comparable adsorption features to FePc (Fig. 1(c)). This suggests that the Fe species in FeNC and FePc share a similar valence state of +2, corroborating the findings from XPS analysis. The presence of the Fe-N bond is indicated by a dominating peak at roughly 1.5 Å in the related extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra for both FeNC and FePc (Fig. 1(d)). Furthermore, the similarity in wavelet transform analysis of the Fe K-edge EXAFS demonstrates a comparable atomic distribution in FeNC and FePc, without the observation of Fe-Fe bonds (Fig. 1(e)). The coordination number of 3.8 is obtained by fitting Fe-N x sites in FeNC. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis confirms that the porous FeNC exhibits a specific surface area of 868.8 m2 g–1 (Fig. S4), which is beneficial to the continuous delivery of electrons and protons during the NO3 –RR. The CuPc/FeNC electrode was examined using SEM images and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) elemental maps. These examinations disclosed a uniform distribution of FeNC on the gas diffusion electrode, while CuPc was observed to be adhering to the surface of FeNC (Figs. S5 and S6). This configuration offers an ample reaction interface for NO3 –RR. 3.2 Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction To accomplish the NO3 –RR in flow cell, a reactant of 0.2 mol L–1 KNO3 dissolved in an electrolyte of 1.0 mol L–1 KOH was employed, and the configuration graph of the flow cell was shown in Fig. S7. The alkaline media can effectively avoid the production of toxic nitrogen oxides compared with those in acidic and neutral media [ 40 ]. Besides, the higher-concentration NO3 – (e.g., 1.0 mol L–1) may obscure the intrinsic activity of catalysts, which makes the reaction mechanism unclearly [ 30 ]. The liquid products were detected by the UV-vis spectrophotometry, and more details were shown in “experimental” and Figs. S8-S10. The presence of NO2 – in the anodic solution was further monitored to prevent potential interference with the quantification of NO2 –, as it may permeate through the anion exchange membrane. As shown in Fig. S11, NO2 – Faradaic efficiency in the anodic solution does not exceed 0.1% with the home-made flow cell, indicating that the NO2 – permeating through the anion exchange membrane does not significantly affect the quantification of NO2 – for this work. Fig. 2 shows the NO3 –RR performance of the CuPc/FeNC, FeNC, and CuPc/XC-72R electrodes. For the CuPc/XC-72R electrode, a more negative potential is needed to drive the NO3 –RR (Fig. 2(a) ), which presented a volcano distribution for NH3 production due to the generation of NO2 – at low overpotential and severe HER at high overpotential (Fig. S12). On FeNC electrode, the reaction overpotential was significantly reduced, and the NH3 Faradaic efficiency was close to 100% at the potential greater than –0.35 V vs. RHE. In addition, NO2 – production was inhibited during a wide potential ranging in –0.28––0.53 V (vs. RHE) (Fig. 2(b), Fig. S12). However, with the potential increasing more negatively, a sharp decline of NH3 Faradaic efficiency occurred because of the irrepressible HER (Fig. S12). Impressively, both H2 and NO2 – were significantly suppressed on CuPc/FeNC electrode, leading to a substantial increase of NH3 production compared with that of FeNC and CuPc/XC-72R electrodes. For example, CuPc/FeNC and FeNC electrodes showed a similar high ratio of FE(NH3)/FE(NO2–) around –0.53 V vs. RHE, which is ~50 times enhancement compared with that of CuPc/XC-72R electrode (Fig. 2(c)). Meanwhile, the CuPc/FeNC electrode exhibited a 1.5-fold NH3 partial current density (j NH3) compared with FeNC electrode. Furthermore, a maximum NH3 partial current density of 273 mA cm–2 on CuPc/FeNC electrode was achieved at the applied potential ranging from –0.31 to –0.61 V vs. RHE (Fig. 2(d)). Additionally, we conducted measurements of double-layer capacitance (C dl), which is directly proportional to the electrochemical surface area (ECSA). The similar Cdls of both electrodes in Fig. S13 affirm that the enhanced activity is not contingent on the quantity of active sites. Furthermore, FeNC and CuPc/FeNC display similar Nyquist curves (Fig. S14), indicating that the enhanced performance of CuPc/FeNC is not attributed to the promotion of electron transfer processes. Above results show that the FeNC and CuPc catalysts have a synergetic effect, which can not only effectively suppress the production of NO2 –, but also show a high performance during NO3 –RR towards NH3 production. This performance outperforms that of recently reported metal-nitrogen-carbon and metal phthalocyanine catalysts in NO3 –RR (Table S1). The catalytic stability of the CuPc/FeNC electrode was also evaluated at constant potential (–0.47 V vs. RHE). The NH3 Faradaic efficiency was stable at about 94% while the current density slightly decreased in 25 h (Fig. S15). 3.3 Electrochemical nitrite reduction reaction NO2 –, an important intermediate during NO3 –RR, is produced by NO3 – reduction (2e– transfer pathway) and is further consumed to NH3 (6e– transfer pathway) [ 13 ]. To investigate the mechanism of the synergetic effect between FeNC and CuPc, electrochemical nitrite reduction reaction (NO2 –RR) measurements were further performed over CuPc/FeNC, FeNC, and CuPc/XC-72R electrodes. Figs. 3(a) and (b) demonstrate that the FeNC electrode prefers to catalyze NO2 – to produce NH3. Within the range of greater positive potentials (–0.16 to –0.43 V vs. RHE), the FeNC electrode demonstrated notable selectivity and efficiency in reducing NO2 – to NH3 (Fig. 3(b) ). Notably, it effectively suppressed the HER in comparison to NO3 –RR (Fig. 3(a)). As a result, at –0.43 V (vs. RHE), the NH3 Faradaic efficiency exceeded 93% with a partial current density of 300 mA cm–2. DFT calculations additionally validate that the associative adsorption of NO2 – on FeNC is more energetically favorable, yielding a calculated adsorption Gibbs free energy of –0.55 eV. This value is markedly lower than that of NO3 – adsorption at 0.27 eV (Fig. 3(d)). The excellent NO2 –RR activity on FeNC electrode was verified by theoretical calculations and experiment results, indicating that the process of NO3 – to NO2 – limits the NO3 –RR activity of FeNC electrode [ 41 ]. Furthermore, CuPc/FeNC and FeNC electrodes performed a similar NH3 partial current density between –0.17 and –0.41 V (vs. RHE) during NO2 –RR (Fig. 3(c)), which is in sharp contrast to the NO3 –RR (Fig. 2(d)). Hence, it could be inferred that the introduction of CuPc on FeNC electrode facilitated the reaction of NO3 – to NO2 – during NO3 –RR. Combined with that the NO2 – can be produced on CuPc during NO3 –RR (Fig. S12), we thus proposed a tandem catalysis strategy. On the CuPc/FeNC electrode, CuPc supplies NO2 – to adjacent FeNC, and sequentially NO2 – is reduced to NH3 on FeNC. 3.4 Ex-situ and operando characterization of CuPc The unusual experiments phenomenon of the CuPc/XC-72R electrode has caught our attention, that is, the NH3 partial current density increased rapidly with applying more negative potential (Fig. 2(d)). Considering the former studies on the reconstruction of Cu-N4 during electrocatalysis [ 42–44 ]. We carried out a series of ex-situ and operando characterizations on CuPc/FeNC and CuPc/XC-72R electrodes. According to the XRD patterns, no metal signal was observed on either the CuPc/FeNC electrode or the CuPc/XC-72R electrode after the electrochemical reduction process (Fig. S16). However, the Cu nanoparticles with the length of 50 nm were observed in TEM images of the post-electrolysis CuPc/XC-72R electrode, indicative of the occurrence of the reconstruction of CuPc (Fig. S17). The CuPc/FeNC electrode in Fig. S18 showed relatively fewer particles exsolved on the main body of CuPc than the CuPc/XC-72R electrode. The difference in amount and size of Cu particles between CuPc/FeNC and CuPc/XC-72R electrodes may be attributed to the decreased overpotential of NO3 –RR after mixing FeNC with CuPc. We further adopt operando XAS measurement to explore the reconstruction of CuPc in CuPc/FeNC and CuPc/XC-72R electrodes during the NO3 –RR. As depicted in Fig. 4(a) , Cu K-edge XANES spectra at 50 mA cm–2 and –0.52 V vs. RHE was basically unchanged when compared to the open circuit potential (OCP) on CuPc/XC-72R electrode, which is corresponding to the peak NO2 – production at –0.47 V vs. RHE (Fig. 2(b)). After increasing the current density to 100 mA cm–2, the pre-edge of Cu K-edge XANES spectra of CuPc/XC-72R electrode moves toward Cu foil, referring to a partial reconstruction of CuPc, which coincided with the experiments of the maximum NH3 Faradaic efficiency (92%) at –0.56 V vs. RHE (Fig. 2(a)). This is also consistent with former studies, which suggested that more negative potential would result in breaking the structure of CuN4 [ 43,44 ]. The operando Raman spectroscopy was further employed to investigate the evolution of CuPc structure over CuPc/XC-72R electrode (Fig. 4(b)). The structure of CuPc at the current density lower than 100 mA cm–2 was almost unchanged when compared to that of OCP, but the peak belonging to Cu-N deformation at 235 cm–1 was slightly attenuated at the applied current density of 100 mA cm–2 [ 45 ]. Simultaneously, the peak of C-H deformation at 1112 cm–1 was extended, and the peak intensity of 1148 cm–1 was lower than OCP, indicating that partial reconstruction of CuPc occurred at relatively high current density. These operando results are well consistent with the TEM images (Fig. S17), which confirms a slight reconstruction of CuPc. This explained why the NH3 partial current density increased rapidly with applying more negative potential (< –0.53 V vs. RHE) over CuPc/XC-72R electrode. However, the Cu K-edge XANES spectra of CuPc/FeNC electrode in Fig. 4(c) also shows a similar curve at 100 mA cm–2 at –0.36 V vs. RHE, indicating that the reconstruction of CuPc was effectively inhibited compared with CuPc/XC-72R electrode. The corresponding Fourier-transforms of EXAFS spectra in Fig. 4(d) clearly shows that the Cu–N bond on CuPc/FeNC electrode was still undamaged at current density lower than 100 mA cm–2, which can be attributed to the introduction of FeNC. FeNC decreases the overpotential of NO3 –RR, preventing obvious CuPc reconstruction. Compared to the CuPc/XC-72R electrode (from –0.48 V to –0.67 V vs. RHE), the CuPc/FeNC electrode maintains the low potential range (–0.31 to –0.61 V vs. RHE) inherited from the FeNC electrode (–0.28 to –0.52 V vs. RHE) (Fig. 2(d)). Above results show that the combination of FeNC and CuPc can efficiently reduce the reconstruction of CuPc, which is consistent with the TEM image after the reaction (Fig. S18). It is worth noting that the CuPc at low overpotentials is beneficial to the production of NO2 – (Fig. 2(b)). Thus far, the high performance of the CuPc/FeNC electrode can be attributed to the tandem effect between FeNC and CuPc. CuPc contributes to the formation of NO2 –, which is subsequently reduced by FeNC at low overpotential. 3.5 DFT calculations DFT calculations were conducted to unravel the reaction mechanism and get insights into the origin of the catalytic performance in NO3 –RR. Firstly, the reaction pathway of the NO3 –RR process is presented in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b) depicts the relevant intermediate structure. The NO3 –RR could be divided into several deoxygenation processes, including *NO3 → *NO2 → *NO → *NOH→ *NHOH → *NH, then will go through hydrogenation steps, *NH → *NH2 → *NH3, and finally desorption of NH3. As we can see, CuPc prefers to activate NO3 – and further produce NO2 – with a downhill free energy change. However, the subsequent hydrogenation of *NO2 to generate NO2H requires a relatively high energy, preventing further reduction to NH3. This is also consistent with the experimental results of NO2 – buildup under higher potential. While for FeNC, a 0.22 eV energy input is required for the first hydrogenation process and is not conducive to the generation of NO2 –. Nonetheless, the further reduction of NO2 – to NH3 is easier on FeNC than on CuPc. Interestingly, the synergistic effect of the two-component catalyst avoids NO2 – accumulation and improves NH3 Faradaic efficiency, which is related to the tandem process. In this process, NO2 – desorbs from CuPc because of the weak adsorption (E ads = –0.43 eV on CuPc) and transferred to FeNC due to its stronger adsorption performance (E ads = –0.55 eV on FeNC). The charge density difference, as illustrated in Fig. 5(c), can be used to further explain the phenomenon. There is obvious charge transfer between *NO2 and Fe active site on FeNC. This is in sharp contrast to the CuPc counterpart where limited electron transferred to *NO2, thus leading to weak adsorption. Bader charge analysis shows that when *NO2 is adsorbed on CuPc, the number of electrons transferred is only 0.07 e– less than that on FeNC (0.16 e–), implying that the *NO2 prefer to be activated on FeNC. In addition, the next hydrogenation step on FeNC is also an exothermic process with the reaction energy of –1.31 eV. In contrast, the hydrogenation step of *NO2 on CuPc is an endothermic process, which is not conducive to further decomposition of NO2 –. Therefore, FeNC is more favorable to proceed the reaction from *NO2 for the further formation of NH3. Subsequently, *NO species are continuously hydrogenated to form *NHO on FeNC with an uphill ΔG values of 0.24 eV. The next hydrogenation process to form *NHOH will require higher energy (0.36 eV). In terms of the overall nitrate reduction process, *NHO → *NHOH shows the highest formation barrier and is defined as PDS (Fig. 5(a)). Thus, the following hydrogenation will go through the path: *NHOH → *NH → *NH2 → *NH3. The last three hydrogenation steps will go through downhill energy changes and finally generate NH3 (g). We then calculated the primary competitive reaction of NO3 –RR, HER, of these two catalysts under alkaline conditions (Fig. 5(d)). This reaction including three steps: H2O adsorption, the breaking of H-OH to form *H and *OH, respectively; *H desorption to produce H2 gas. The related adsorption structures are shown in Fig. S19. The changes of adsorption Gibbs free energy (ΔG ads) of H2O on CuPc and FeNC are 0.38 and –0.36 eV, respectively. The following H-OH breaking on CuPc (1.86 eV) will require more energy than FeNC (1.47 eV). And the adsorption of *H on FeNC (–0.13 eV) is stronger than that on CuPc (0.32 eV). The suitable *H adsorption energy on FeNC is also beneficial to the hydrogenation process to produce NH3. All above results demonstrated that CuPc is not conductive to produce H2 (g), which is coordinated with former experimental results (Fig. S12). 4 Conclusions In summary, the two-component CuPc/FeNC catalyst was developed and achieved efficient synergistic catalytic conversion to balance high NH3 partial current density and Faradaic efficiency for NO3 –RR. Compared with the CuPc or FeNC electrode alone, there is significant enhancement in NH3 partial current density over CuPc/FeNC electrode at relatively low overpotentials. The electrochemical operando spectroscopy and DFT calculation results revealed the tandem mechanism as follows: the NO3 – was firstly reduced to NO2 – on CuPc, and then FeNC promoted the reduction of NO2 – to NH3. DFT calculations further demonstrated that the weaker *NO2 adsorption and high PDS for the reduction of NO2 – on CuPc leading to above tandem catalysis process. This work incorporated CuPc with FeNC to improve NO3 –RR selectivity for NH3 production and presented a potential avenue for designing and synthesizing efficient catalysts.

        "dc:description": "Cu-based catalysts have been extensively studied to enhance the performance of the electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3–RR), while it is still a challenge to balance high ammonia (NH3) current density and Faradaic efficiency. Here, we incorporated nitrogen coordinated iron single atom catalyst (FeNC) with copper phthalocyanine (CuPc), denoted as CuPc/FeNC, for NO3–RR. Compared with the two individual catalysts, this two-component catalyst increases NH3 Faradaic efficiency and current density at low overpotentials, achieves efficient synergistic catalytic conversion. Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the enhanced electrochemical performance of CuPc/FeNC catalyst comes from the tandem process, in which NO2 – is produced on CuPc and then transferred to FeNC and further reduced to NH3. In this exceptional tandem catalyst system, an outstanding NH3 Faradaic efficiency close to 100% was achieved at potentials greater than –0.35 V vs. RHE, coupled with a peak NH3 partial current density of 273 mA cm–2 at –0.57 V vs. RHE, effectively suppressing NO2 – production across the entire potential range. This strategy provides a design platform for the continued advancement of NO3 –RR catalysts.",
