Graphical abstract Density functional calculations were employed to determine the formation mechanisms of the Mo-methylidene species in Mo/HBeta zeolite catalysts. It was found that both free energy barriers and reaction heats for the whole processes were lower in the Mo(VI) rather than in the Mo(V) active site, indicating that the Mo(VI) active site is more efficient to produce the Mo(VI)-methylidene species over the Mo/HBeta catalysts. Furthermore, the reactivities of the Mo active sites with different oxidation states were elucidated by the electronic properties of the Ob-ligands bonded to the Mo centers. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were performed to optimize the Mo active sites in HBeta zeolite catalysts as well as to locate the reaction pathways to form the Mo-methylidene species. Two different Mo active sites, i.e., the oxidized MoVIO2 and its reduced form MoVO(OH), were developed and incorporated into HBeta zeolites by replacing a pair of Brønsted acidic sites. The Mo-methylidene species were found to be produced through two elementary reaction steps, and the Mo-oxametallacyclobutanes were identified as the intermediates. The activation barriers of the decompositions of the oxametallacyclobutane intermediates (Step 2) were estimated to be higher than those of the ethene addition on the Mo active sites (Step 1). The oxidation states of the Mo centers exerted marked influences on the stabilities of the intermediates as well as on the activation barriers and reaction heats of Steps 1 and 2, which were elucidated by the electronic properties of the Ob-ligands directly bonded to the Mo centers. Both free energy barriers and reaction heats have indicated that the whole processes of generating the Mo-methylidene species were preferred over the Mo(VI) rather than Mo(V) active site. Accordingly, the Mo(VI) active site was more efficient in catalyzing the formation of Mo-methylidene species in the heterogeneous Mo/HBeta catalytic systems. Keywords Active sites Density functional calculations Mo/HBeta catalysts Olefin metathesis Oxidation states 1 Introduction Zeolites are three-dimensional aluminosilicates with molecular-dimension cages and channels acting as micro-reactors. The loading of molybdenum (Mo) species into the acidic sites of zeolites enhances their performances in many catalytic processes, such as selective oxidation, hydrodesulfurization and metathesis [1–5]. Recently, our laboratory has reported that the Mo-loaded HBeta zeolite exhibits activities for the metathesis reaction of ethene and 2-butene to form propene [6,7]. Addition of alumina into the HBeta zeolite resulted in a proportion of the Mo species preferentially migrating into the alumina phase. A higher reactivity was thus obtained compared to the pure zeolite catalysts [7]. The metal-carbene species are usually acknowledged as the initiating and propagating intermediates in olefin metathesis, as described by the Hérisson-Chauvin mechanism [8–10]. However, it is still unclear how the metal-carbene species is formed on the metal-supported catalysts [8,9,11–19]. The dynamic counting experiments indicated that in the highly dispersed Mo/Al2O3 catalysts, less than 1% Mo sites are active for the propene metathesis [20,21]. It thus becomes challenging to detect the Mo active sites with the current spectroscopy techniques. Very recently, Salameh et al. [22] have studied the reaction of Re2O7/Al2O3 catalysts with various olefins and shown that the creation of Re-carbene species does not require an allylic olefin. A four-membered oxametallacyclobutane structure was considered to act as the intermediate, which was formed and then decomposed to produce metal-carbene species. A large number of quantum chemical calculations have been devoted to the mechanistic studies on ethene addition to OsO4 and ReO3L (L denotes the ligand) to produce the metallaoxetane intermediates [19,23–28]. As to the Mo-based catalysts, only few computational studies were conducted on the homogeneous systems. Rappé and Goddard [11,29] investigated the activation process of ethene by the simple MoVIO2Cl2 complex via the pseudo-Wittig mechanism. What will happen if the complex is switched to the heterogeneous Mo-based HBeta zeolite catalysts? It is a question worthy of further investigations. Furthermore, most of the previous theoretical calculations focused on the metallaoxetane intermediates, while the important process of dissociating the metallaoxetane intermediates to form the metal-carbene species has not received enough attention. In this work, the whole reaction processes from the Mo active sites to the Mo-carbene species were investigated with the aid of density functional calculations. The Mo/HBeta zeolite was used as the catalyst. The activation barriers of the two reaction steps, i.e., the formations of the metallaoxetane intermediates from the Mo active sites as well as the Mo-carbene species from the decomposition of the metallaoxetane intermediates, were obtained. Owing to their low concentrations as described above, the oxidation states of the Mo active sites still remain pendent. Grüenert et al. [30,31] considered that the Mo(VI) active sites were responsible for the reactivity whereas the Mo(V) species were the by-products. On the contrary, the ESR results obtained by Jin's group [32] supported the Mo(V) active sites. The Mo(IV) species were also claimed to be active sites in the Mo/SiO2 catalysts prepared via the fixation of organometallic complexes [12,33,34] or by photo-reduction [8,9,35,36]. In our in situ ESR studies (in preparation), the intensity of the Mo(V) peak became stronger upon exposure to alkene atmosphere under reaction conditions, which was caused by the reduction of Mo(VI) sites. The in situ XPS studies of ours further pointed out that the Mo(IV) signals were detected after a long reaction period, accompanied by the deactivation of the catalysts. Accordingly, the Mo(IV) species may be the precursors but unlikely to be active sites. The possible Mo(V) and Mo(VI) active sites were considered here to initiate the metathesis reactions, which were incorporated into HBeta zeolite by replacing a pair of Brønsted acidic sites. Parallel density functional calculations of the two oxidation states were performed on the whole reaction pathways. On the basis of these calculations, the electronic properties of the oxygen ligands bonded to the Mo(V) and Mo(VI) sites were studied, providing insights into the relative stabilities of the oxametallacyclobutane intermediates as well as the energy barriers of the elementary reaction steps. 2 Computational details 2.1 Cluster models The Beta zeolite models were taken from the framework structure of polymorph A reported by Newsam et al. [37]. Beta zeolite has two straight channels (0.76nm×0.64nm) perpendicular to each other and another helical channel (0.55nm×0.55nm) perpendicular to the previous two. The three channels intersect with each other and form the open pore systems [38]. The β-site (Fig. 1 ) consisting of planar deformed six-membered rings (6-MR) represents the most stable and preferable location of transition metal ions in HBeta zeolite. The visible and FTIR spectral studies on the Co(II) sited in dehydrated HBeta zeolite suggested that the CoII ions predominated in the β-sites where two framework Al atoms were situated nearby [39]. In addition, the recent quantum chemical calculations of Zn(II)-exchanged HBeta zeolite indicated that a majority of Zn(II) ions were located at the six-membered rings, and the results were confirmed by the EXAFS experiments [40]. Thus the β-sites in HBeta zeolite were chosen here to hold the exchanged Mo ions. The 27Al MQ MAS NMR results showed that Al atoms in T1 and T2 sites of HBeta zeolite resisted dealumination and accordingly did not adopt octahedral oxygen coordination, suggesting that these two sites were energetically favoured over the other T sites [41]. As shown in Fig. 1, the geometries of the T1 and T2 sites in the six-membered rings are quite similar, and the two T1 sites were replaced by the Al atoms. The two T1 sites are next-next-nearest neighbors (NNNN) to each other, which obey the Lowenstein's rule. The cluster approaches have been proven sufficient to reproduce the properties and catalysis of metal-exchanged zeolites [42–46]. In this work, the Mo-exchanged Beta zeolites were represented by clusters containing 10 T sites, which were much larger than the commonly used 5 T clusters [42,46]. Similar Beta cluster models were used by Pietrzyk et al. [47] to study the properties and reactivities of the VVO2-exchanged Beta zeolite. The clusters were terminated by H atoms bonded to O or Si atoms, directing towards what would have been the next zeolite framework atoms. The terminal Si–H and O–H distances were fixed at 1.500 and 1.000Å, respectively. The terminal H, O and Si atoms were kept fixed during the geometry optimizations in order to retain the local geometries of Beta zeolite, while the other atoms were allowed to relax fully so as to consider the deformations of the zeolite frameworks induced by the extra-framework species. 2.2 Theoretical methods Density functional theory calculations were performed using the nonlocal three-parameter B3LYP density functional, which combines the Becke's exchange [48,49] and Lee, Yang and Parr's correlation functionals [50,51]. The LANL2DZ basis set with relativistic effective core potential (RECP) of Hay and Wadt [52] was used to describe the Mo element, and the 6-31G(d,p) basis set for all the remaining elements. Such a combination was designated as basis set 1 (B1). The structures were optimized without any symmetry constraints, and frequency calculations at the same level of theory (B3LYP/B1) were carried out to ensure that all the stationary points (reactant, products and intermediates) possess no imaginary vibrations and the transition states each possess only one imaginary vibration. The Gibbs free energies corrected by zero point energies (ZPE) were computed from the harmonic frequencies at 400K and 1atm, consistent with the experimental conditions [6]. The atomic charges were obtained using the Mulliken Population Analysis (MPA) scheme. The above computational methods (B3LYP/B1) have been reported to obtain satisfactory results for late-transition-metal reactions [53]. To further confirm the reliability of B3LYP/B1 methods, some important structures were also optimized with larger basis set (B2). The details of the B2 basis set were as follows: The same RECP as in B1 was used for Mo, augmented with a f-polarization function (exponent 1.043) [54], and the other atoms were described by the 6-31+G(d,p) basis set. As elucidated in the forthcoming Section 3, the B3LYP/B2 geometries showed quite similar features to those of the B3LYP/B1 methods. The total and relative energies were computed at the B3LYP/B2//B3LYP/B1 level of theory, since the recent calculations [23,55] of metal-oxide additions to olefins have shown that the B3LYP/B2 energies were in excellent agreements with the CCSD(T) theoretical and the experimental results. All the calculations were performed with the Gaussian98 software package [56]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Geometric structure of the Mo(VI) active site The Mo/HBeta catalysts were prepared by impregnation of HBeta with aqueous ammonium heptamolybdate (AHM) solution. By calcinating the sample at high temperature, MoO2(OH)2 precursors, which may result from the decomposition of AHM, can migrate into the zeolite channels, where it reacts with the acidic proton to form the MoO2(OH)+ active sites. At even higher temperatures, the MoO2(OH)+ active sites can further react with a vicinal Brønsted acidic proton to form the MoO2 2+ active sites within zeolite pores, as shown in the reaction below [57–59]. H+Z−Z−H+ +H2MOO4 →Z−MOO2 2+Z− +2H2O The energy-minimum and transition-state structures along the reaction path of ethene addition to the Mo(VI) active site a1 to form the Mo-methylidene species a5 are presented in Fig. 2 , with the important geometrical parameters listed in Table 1 . The Mo(VI) active site possesses a symmetrical dioxo structure anchored by the lattice-O atoms. The distances between the Mo and dioxo O atoms (Oa and Ob) are about 1.70Å, characteristic of MoO double bonds. As deduced from the Mo–Oz distances (Oz from the zeolite lattices), the Mo(VI) center forms four direct bonds with the Oz atoms belonging to the six-membered ring, consistent with the recent quantum mechanics results on various transition-metal-ion (TMI)-zeolite systems [60–64]. Moreover, the minimal MoOz bond length is found equal to 2.122Å and the Mo–Al distances are equal to 3.078Å, which are also in agreement with the previous results of the Mo species encaged in other zeolites [65,66]. 3.2 Mo-methylidene formation over the Mo(VI) active site According to the pseudo-Wittig mechanism shown in Scheme 1a, the first stage is the formation of the oxamolybdacyclobutane intermediate a3. As the optimized geometries indicated, a3 exhibits a trigonal bipyramidal (TBP) geometry. The oxo-Ob and lattice-O11’ atoms are the apical ligands. The three equatorial-O and Mo atoms fall almost within the same plane, which can be observed from the summed ∠O11–Mo–Oa, ∠Oa–Mo–C2 and ∠C2–Mo–O11 angles with the value of 359.1°. The oxamolybdacyclobutane intermediate a3 results from the [2+2] cycloaddition of MoOa in the Mo(VI) active site a1 and C1 C2 in ethene. New MoC2 and C1 Oa bonds are formed with the distances optimized at 2.229 and 1.429Å, respectively. Meanwhile, the original MoOa and C1 C2 double bonds are severely impaired and turn to single bonds (see the exact values in Table 1). That is, four single bonds constitute the MoOaC1C2 oxamolybdacyclobutane ring in the intermediate a3. As the data in Table 1 showed, the geometric parameters at B3LYP/B1 and B3LYP/B2 levels are quite close to each other, and therefore the additional polarization functions exert slight influences on the geometries. The a1 and a3 stationary points are connected with the transition state a2, which has more features alike to a3 rather than a1. In a2, the C1 C2 bond is elongated to 1.422Å (vs. 1.330Å in the isolated ethene molecule and 1.513Å in a3), suggesting that the ethene molecule has been much activated. The oxo-Ob and lattice-O11’ ligands in a2 are greatly tilted with the ∠Ob–Mo–O11’ angle calculated at 155.5°, different from the axial direction in a3 (∠Ob–Mo–O11’=166.9°). It is caused by the long distance between the ethene fragment and MoOa bond. A significant portion of the MoC2 bond is formed in a2 with the distance equal to 2.321Å. It proves only 0.092Å elongated compared with the corresponding bond in a3. However, the C1 Oa distance is optimized at 1.890Å, being 0.461Å longer than that in a3. It indicates that the formation of the C1 Oa bond lags far behind the MoC2 bond. Owing to the formation of the C1 Oa bond, the negative charge on the Oa atom increases from −0.42a.u. in a1 to −0.58a.u. in a3. The C1 atom is negative (−0.43a.u.) in the isolated ethene molecule but positive (0.13a.u.) in the intermediate a3, which is due to the formation of a direct bond with the Oa atom of larger electronegativity. An electronic charge of ca. 0.35a.u. is transferred from the C2H4 to the MoO2 fragments. Accordingly, the formation of the a3 intermediate can be regarded as the electrophilic attack of the MoVIO2 2+ fragment to the π-bond of the ethene molecule. According to the population analysis, the stages of a1 → a2 → a3 witness the gradual transfer of negative charges from the ethene to the MoVIO2 2+ fragments, consistent with the geometric analysis as described above. The opening of the four-membered ring in the a3 intermediate leads to the final product of the Mo-methylidene species (a5) and formaldehyde (Scheme 1a). The transition-state structure of the a3 → a5 conversion step is denoted as a4. It was found that a4 has a very flat ring with the Mo–C2–Oa–C1 dihedral of 178.4°. However, the angle between the oxo-Ob and lattice-O11’ ligands, i.e., Ob–Mo–O11’, is equal to 144.6° and deviates severely from 180.0° in an ideal TBP geometry, which may be caused by the loosely bound formaldehyde fragment. The comparisons between the bond lengths in structures a3 and a4 show that the C1 C2 bond is elongated by 0.515Å and is more obvious than the MoOa bond elongated by 0.094Å. The Mo center in the Mo-methylidene structure a5 has one oxo-Ob-ligand, one carbene group and four direct bonds with the lattice-Oz atoms. In a5, the Mo–C2 distance is equal to 1.934Å, close to the Mo–C lengths of the Mo-methylidene species on the silica and alumina clusters [67,68]. There is little spectroscopic evidence for the metal-carbene species anchored on the surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts. In this work, the C–H-stretching frequencies in a5 are calculated at 3233.6 and 3125.2cm−1, well consistent with the reported data of 3225 and 3096cm−1 for the alkylidene moiety on molybdena–alumina [69]. The energy diagram of the whole process; i.e., from the addition of ethene towards the Mo-dioxo active site a1 to the final product of the Mo-methylidene species a5, is graphically presented in Fig. 3 . According to the B3LYP/B2//B3LYP/B1 results, the formation of the oxametallacyclobutane a3 from a1 is an endothermic process (ΔE =8.2kcalmol−1) with a moderate activation barrier (24.4kcalmol−1). Step 2 occurs with a higher energy barrier (about 34.0kcalmol−1), since the formation of the product a5 requires the ruptures of two direct bonds in the oxametallacyclobutane intermediate a3 (C1–C2 =1.513Å and Mo–Oa =1.936Å). This activation barrier is close to that of the cleavage of the Re-metallaoxetane complex to the Re-carbene species [26,27]. The free energy profile at 400K is shown in Fig. 4 , based on the B3LYP/B1 level of theory and corrected with zero point energies. As expected from the loss of the translational entropy (S) in the bimolecular reaction a1 +C2H4 → a3, the Gibbs free energies (G) produces a higher barrier as well as less stable intermediate a3 and transition state a2 than predicted from the electronic energies in Fig. 3. The free energy ΔG for Step 1 is estimated at 23.1kcalmol−1, crossing over a free energy barrier of 40.4kcalmol−1. Accordingly, the formation of the oxametallacyclobutane intermediate is thermodynamically disfavoured. However, the situation is opposite in Step 2, a3 → a5 +HCHO, where the gain in the entropy for a dissociation reaction leads to a lower energy barrier and more stable products a5 and transition state a4 than those predicted from the electronic energies in Fig. 3. The decomposition of the TBP intermediate a3 into the products is slightly exothermic (−2.0kcalmol−1), overcoming a barrier height of 32.9kcalmol−1, indicating that the generation of the Mo-carbene species is an energetically advantageous process. It is revealed that the Mo-alkylidene species can be created by ethene and do not require olefins with allylic CH bonds, which thus provides the direct evidence for the pseudo-Wittig mechanisms in the heterogeneous systems. However, the energy barriers of the present work are relatively high, which can be caused by the low reactivity of ethene. A significant reduction in the energy barriers of Step 2 was observed when 2-butene instead of ethene reacts over the Mo active sites [70]. 3.3 Geometric structure of the MoV active site At elevated temperatures, the transformations from the Mo(VI) to Mo(V) active sites can occur in the presence of olefins or other reducing agents. The Mo(V) peak was also detected in the Mo/Al2O3 catalysts when the sample was pretreated with an inert gas or alkene [31,32]. The optimized MoVO(OH)/T1T1 model, b1, is shown in Fig. 5 and the selected geometrical parameters are given in Table 2 . The terminal MoOa bond is 1.671Å, slightly shorter than that in the MoVIO2 monomer. The MoOH single bond length is 1.957Å, close to that reported for the adsorption of H atoms on the oxo groups of Mo3O9 clusters [71]. Furthermore, the hydroxyl group is oriented towards the framework O11 atom, forming the hydrogen bond with the distance of 2.202Å. 3.4 Mo-methylidene formation over the Mo(V) active site The geometries of the energy minima and transition states along the reaction pathway are depicted in Fig. 5, and the selected geometrical parameters are given in Table 2. As shown in Scheme 1, the reaction pathway of the Mo(V)-carbene formation on the b1 active site is analogous to the Mo(VI)-carbene formation on the a1 active site. The addition of ethene to b1 produces the oxametallacyclobutane intermediate b3, and the following is the cycloreversion resulting in the products of the Mo(V)-methylidene species b5 and formaldehyde. The comparisons of the energy minima and the transition-state geometries (Figs. 2 and 5) indicate that the reaction pathways on the a1 and b1 active sites have many similar characteristics. From the transition structure b2 to the oxametallacyclobutane intermediate b3, the formation of the MoC2 bond is anterior to the C1 Oa bond, and from b3 to b4, the MoOa bond is less elongated than the C1 C2 bond, which are in good agreement with the results of the a series (a1–a5). The C–H stretching vibrations in b5 are computed at 3187.6cm−1 and 3076.9cm−1, also close to the reported values. The structural differences of the b series (b1–b5) with the a series (a1–a5) are the substitutions of an oxo-O atom with a hydroxyl group, which allows weak interactions with the adjacent lattice-O atoms. In the energy minima b3 and b5, the hydroxyl H atoms form hydrogen bonds with the nearest equatorial lattice-O11 atoms with their distances optimized at 2.270Å and 2.338Å, respectively. However, the apical O ligands are much more tilted in the transition states b2 and b4 (∠Ob–Mo–O11’=154.2° in b2 and 145.6° in b4, respectively) compared with those in the energy minima b1 and b5, where the ∠Ob–Mo–O11’ angles are equal to 177.4° and 171.5°, respectively. As a result, the hydroxyl H atoms in the transition states shift away from the lattice-O11 atoms and point towards the lattice-O32 atoms not belonging to the TBP geometries (Fig. 5). The ObHO32 hydrogen bonds are calculated at 2.355 in b2 and 2.141Å in b4, respectively. Despite the numerous geometrical similarities of the Mo(VI) and Mo(V) pathways, their energy profiles are different as shown in Figs. 3 and 4. With the entry points (a1 +C2H4 and b1 +C2H4) of each pathway set as the benchmark, the other energy minima are more stable in the case of Mo(VI) active site than in the case of Mo(V) active site. That is, the oxametallacyclobutane intermediate b3 is formed more endothermically (ΔE =12.7kcalmol−1, ΔG =28.9kcalmol−1) than the corresponding intermediate a3. The activation barrier of Step 1 in the Mo(V) active site is also 4.7kcalmol−1 higher in energy than in the Mo(VI) active site. For Step 1, the negative charges transferred are calculated to be 0.35 and 0.29a.u. for the Mo(VI) and Mo(V) active sites, respectively. As this step is an electrophilic attack, the less transferred charges in the Mo(V) active site will be expected to have higher barriers, which were confirmed by the calculated data discussed earlier. However, the situation is changed for Step 2. At this step, the formation of the Mo(V)-methylidene species has an activation barrier about 2.5kcalmol−1 lower than that of the Mo(VI)-methylidene species, which can be attributed to the less stable intermediate b3 (Figs. 3 and 4). 3.5 Electronic effects and frontier orbital analysis As discussed above, the formations of the Mo-methylidene species over the Mo(VI)-dioxo and Mo(V)-monooxo active sites proceed via two independent pathways. The energy barriers of the elementary reaction steps are sensitive to the oxidation states of the Mo centers. The oxo-Ob-ligands present in the a series act as an electron-withdrawing group, which causes the Mo(VI) center more electrophilic and thus conduces to the reduction of energy barriers for the formation of the oxametallacyclobutane intermediate a3. Compared with the respective entry points (a1 +C2H4 and b1 +C2H4), the oxametallacyclobutane intermediates are of higher stabilities in the case of the Mo(VI) active site, which however accounts for the higher energy barrier in the following [2+2] cycloreversions. The introduction of the hydroxyl group at the Mo(V) active site decreases the positive charge of the Mo(V) center to 1.43a.u. instead of 1.52a.u. of the Mo(VI) center, which in turn causes a decreased affinity for the ethene molecule. Meanwhile, the less electropositive Mo(V) center weakens the MoOa bond, so the oxametallacyclobutane intermediate of b3 is destabilized and results in a lower activation barrier for the subsequent [2+2] cycloreversion step. In both reaction pathways, the activation barriers of Step 2 are estimated to be higher than those of Step 1 (Fig. 3). The overall free energy barriers at B3LYP/B1 level are calculated at 56.0 and 58.1kcalmol−1 on the Mo(VI) and Mo(V) active sites, respectively (Fig. 4). That is, the activation barrier is slightly lower in the case of the Mo(VI) active site. In addition, their reaction heats for the overall process are estimated to be 21.1 and 33.7kcalmol−1, respectively, which indicates that the process on the Mo(VI) active site is much preferred in thermodynamics. Accordingly, the Mo(VI) active site rather than the Mo(V) active site is more efficient in catalyzing the formation of the Mo-carbene species, and therefore the Mo-methylidene species is more likely to form with the Mo center of +VI oxidation state. The isosurfaces of the frontal molecular orbitals of the two Mo-oxo centers are presented in Fig. 6 . The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of a1 is related to the p orbitals of the lattice-O atoms, whereas the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is predominantly from the Mo d-orbitals. In b1, the shape and size of the HOMO and LUMO differ significantly from those of a1. The HOMO is composed of the d xy orbital of the Mo(V) center and the p y orbital of the oxo-Ob atom, while the LUMO is attributed to the d z 2 orbital of the Mo(V) center. Obviously, the HOMO of a1 is not involved in the reaction process, and therefore it is very likely for a1 to offer LUMO to interact with the HOMO of the incoming ethene molecule. It is consistent with the above Mulliken charge analysis and supports the electrophilic nature. In addition, the energy gap between the HOMO of ethene and the LUMO of a1 is calculated at 0.13a.u. and 0.02a.u. lower than that to b1, which indicates the slightly higher reactivity of a1 than b1 towards the ethene molecule. 4 Conclusions The reaction mechanisms of the Mo-methylidene formation over the Mo/HBeta zeolite catalysts were studied with density functional methods. Two different Mo active sites, the oxidized form MoVIO2 and the reduced form MoVO(OH), were considered. It was found that the Mo-carbene formations are divided into two elementary reaction steps via the pseudo-Wittig mechanism: Step 1 is the endothermic formation of the oxametallacyclobutane intermediates through the [2+2] cycloaddition between the CC bonds in ethene and MoOa bonds in the Mo active sites; Step 2 is the opening of the four-membered rings in the oxametallacyclobutane intermediates producing the Mo-methylidene species. The activation barriers of Step 2 were estimated to be higher than Step 1: 33.9kcalmol−1 vs. 24.4kcalmol−1 and 31.4kcalmol−1 vs. 29.1kcalmol−1 on the Mo(VI) and Mo(V) active sites, respectively. In addition, it was revealed that Mo-alkylidene species can be created by ethene and do not require olefins with allylic CH bonds, which substantiates the pseudo-Wittig mechanisms in heterogeneous systems. The reactivities of the Mo active sites were dependent on their oxidation states, which were elucidated by the electronic properties of the Ob-ligands bonded to the Mo centers. Step 1 was facilitated by the electron-withdrawing Ob-ligand in the Mo(VI) active site; instead, Step 2 was more facile in the Mo(V) active site owing to the destabilized Mo-oxametallacyclobutane intermediates caused by the presence of the electron-donating –ObH group. For the whole processes of generating the Mo-methylidene species from the Mo active sites, both of the free energy barriers and reaction heats were found to be lower in the Mo(VI) rather than in the Mo(V) active site, indicating that the initiation reaction over the Mo(VI) active site was preferred. Accordingly, the Mo(VI) active site was more efficient in producing the Mo(VI)-methylidene species over the Mo/HBeta catalysts.

        "dc:description": "Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were performed to optimize the Mo active sites in HBeta zeolite catalysts as well as to locate the reaction pathways to form the Mo-methylidene species. Two different Mo active sites, i.e., the oxidized MoVIO2 and its reduced form MoVO(OH), were developed and incorporated into HBeta zeolites by replacing a pair of Brønsted acidic sites. The Mo-methylidene species were found to be produced through two elementary reaction steps, and the Mo-oxametallacyclobutanes were identified as the intermediates. The activation barriers of the decompositions of the oxametallacyclobutane intermediates (Step 2) were estimated to be higher than those of the ethene addition on the Mo active sites (Step 1). The oxidation states of the Mo centers exerted marked influences on the stabilities of the intermediates as well as on the activation barriers and reaction heats of Steps 1 and 2, which were elucidated by the electronic properties of the Ob-ligands directly bonded to the Mo centers. Both free energy barriers and reaction heats have indicated that the whole processes of generating the Mo-methylidene species were preferred over the Mo(VI) rather than Mo(V) active site. Accordingly, the Mo(VI) active site was more efficient in catalyzing the formation of Mo-methylidene species in the heterogeneous Mo/HBeta catalytic systems.",
