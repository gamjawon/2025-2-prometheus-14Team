Hydrogenation activity was affected by the kind of tin compounds used for the preparation of the Ru-Sn catalyst. Bis-tributyl tin oxide ((Bu3Sn)20), K2SnO3 and Na2SnO3 were found to be the appropriate materials for the hydrogenation of C=O group over the Ru-Sn catalysts. The C=O hydrogenation activity for the hydrogenation of carboxylic acids increased with the increasing amount of Sn added whereas, the C=C hydrogenation activity decreased. Effect of activation temperature was also studied. The C=O hydrogenation activity was increased by calcinating the catalyst precursor, Sn/alumina, before impregnation with Ru solution. The calcination of the Sn/alumina at 973 K was quite effective for the hydrogenation of carboxylic acids over the resultant Ru-Sn/alumina catalysts. The Ru-Sn/alumina catalysts reduced at 723 K were also effective for the hydrogenation of carboxylic acids. We have also studied the hydrogenation in a continuously flowing system. The Ru-Sn/alumina catalysts showed high and stable activity under mild conditions in the flowing system. Keywords: Ru-Sn catalysts; Hydrogenation; Carboxylic Acid 1. Introduction The hydrogenation of fatty acids to fatty alcohols is one of important industrial processes. Fatty alcohols have been commercially produced by hydrogenation of fatty acid esters.

Hydrogenation of rosin to rosin alcohol. many catalysts were investigated for the hydrogenation of esters to the correspond- ing alcohols. We have reported the hydrogenation of dicarboxylates by Rh-Sn bimetallic catalysts [2]. Direct hydrogenation of fatty acids to fatty alcohols is very important reaction for industries. But it is difficult to use copper chromite catalysts because the copper in the catalysts were readily leached out during the reaction. There are some reports of direct hydrogenation of carboxylic acids. It was reported that fatty acids were hydrogenated to fatty alcohols by an acid-resistant spinel copper chromite catalyst [3] in the condition of a high pressure and temperature. Using Ru-Sn catalyst prepared by the sol-gel method, the hydrogenation of oleic acid to 9-octadecen-1-ol under mild conditions were reported by Mizukami et al. [4]. But the sol-gel method is not practically applicable for the preparation of industrial catalysts. Thus fatty alcohols have been commercially produced by hydrogenation of fatty acid esters. It is our purpose to hydrogenate carboxylic acids to the corresponding alcohols on the catalysts prepared by a more practical impregnation method. We have been studying to hydrogenate carboxylates to the corresponding alcohols for industrial purposes. This paper focuses on the hydrogenation of carboxylic acids to alcohol, directly on Ru-Sn/alumina catalysts. We report the hydrogenation of rosin, which can be transformed to a useful rosin alcohol (Fig. 1). The hydrogenation reactions of some other carboxylic acids to corresponding alcohols in liquid phase were also studied. 2. Experimental 2.1. Reagents A ruthenium nitrosil nitrate (Ru(NO)(NO3)3) solution (containing 5% Ru) was obtained from N.E. Chemcat Corporation, SnC12-2H20 from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, (BuaSn)20 from Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co., K2SnO3 (containing 39 wt% Sn) and Na2SnO3 from Nihon Kagaku Sangyo Co. Tin sulfamate, tin 2-ethylhex- anoate and benzoic acid were obtained from Kishida Reagents Chemicals. The support alumina (Neobead GB, 220m2g-1, 0.58 ml g-l) was obtained from K. Tahara et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 154 (1997) 75-86 77 Mizusawa Industrial Chemicals. The reactants, lauric acid, 2-ethylhexanoic acid, hexanoic acid and oleic acid were obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries. Cyclohexanecarboxylic acid was obtained from Aldrich Chemical Company. 2.2. Preparation of 5 wt% Ru, 11.7% Sn/Ale03 Alumina (17.66 g) was soaked in an aqueous solution of KzSnO3 (6 g of K2SnO3 in 60 ml of water). The mixture was aged for 12 h at room temperature and was dried at 343 K in vacuo. The powder obtained was calcined at 973 K in an air stream for 2 h and dried at 343 K in vacuo. Then 18 g of this powder was soaked in a 2-propanol solution of Ru(NO)(NO3)3 (17.05 g of Ru(NO)(NO3)3 solution in 60 ml of 2-propanol). The mixture was aged for 12 h at room temperature. The solvent was removed at 343 K under vacuum. The catalyst precursors were reduced in a hydrogen stream at 723 K for 2 h and cooled under nitrogen atmosphere. 2.3. Hydrogenation reaction The hydrogenation reaction was carried out in a stainless steel autoclave equipped with a mechanical stirrer (volume: 300 ml). The reactor was charged with 30 g of rosin (Arakawa Chemical Industries), 3 g of catalyst and 57 g of diethyleneglycol dimethylether as a solvent. After purging with 0.98 MPa in gauge of hydrogen for three times, the reactor was pressurized with H2 to 5.9 MPa. The temperature was raised up to 533 K for 1 h and the pressure in the reactor was increased from 5.9 MPa to 9.8 MPa. The reaction was performed at 533 K under 9.8 MPa for 6 h. The reactor was cooled down to room temperature; then the reaction mixture was recovered for a product analysis. For the flow reactor experiments, a 20 ml of fixed bed reactor (12 mm ID, 200 mm) was charged with 18 g of catalyst and was heated in an oven to 533- 553 K. LHSV values were adjusted by the reactor length. A solution of rosin/ solvent (20 wt/wt%) was continuously fed at 30 ml rain-Z into the reactor. Diethylene-glycol dibuthylether was used as a solvent. Hydrogen was also fed at 20 1 h-~ of flow rate. The diagram of the flowing system was shown in Fig. 2. 2.4. Analysis of hydrogenation products The solvent was removed by vacuum distillation, after the catalyst was filtered off after the reaction. The reaction products were analyzed by the acid value and the hydroxyl value [5]. Conversion of rosin and selectivity to rosin alcohol were estimated from the acid value and the hydroxyl value. The hydrogenation of C=C bond was evaluated by 1H-NMR measurement. Liquid component of the reaction mixture in the flow system was analyzed on HPLC (Shimadzu Co. Ltd, LC-10A, column ODP 6.0 tumiD 250 ram, solvent MeOH: water:acetic acid----80 : 20 : 1). The hydrogenation products of various 78 K.

Effect of starting material of Sn on catalytic activity and selectivity We have prepared the Ru-Sn catalysts by impregnation method using various tin compounds (Table 2). The Ru-Sn/A1203 catalyst prepared from (Bu3Sn)20 gave rosin alcohol in a high conversion (Run 1). Unfortunately, organic tin compounds have strong toxicity and thus are not suitable for industrial use as catalyst precursor. We tried inorganic tin compounds as they are non-toxic, but SnC12 and tin sulfamate showed low conversion (Run 2, 3). The catalysts prepared from tin 2-ethylhexanoate, K2SnO3 and Na2SnO3 showed higher conversion than the catalyst prepared from SnC12 and tin sulfamate (Run 4-6). The conversion of rosin decreased in the order K2SnO3 > Na2SnO3 ~ tin 2-ethylhexanoate > SnC12 > tin sulfamate. On the other hand, selectivity of rosin alcohol was high on those catalysts, which were not prepared from SnC12. Table 1 shows the catalyst composition on the Ru-Sn catalysts. Considerable amount of sulfur was detected by EDX analysis on the catalyst prepared from tin sulfamate. Considerable amount of chlorine was detected by EDX analysis on the catalyst prepared from SnC12. On the other hand, neither C1 nor S was detected on the catalysts prepared from tin 2-ethylhexanoate, K2SnO3 and Na2SnO3 because these resources do not contain chlorine or sulfur. Generally, it is known that S is a poison to noble metal catalysts [6]. It would inhibit the hydrogenation activity of C=O. We have studied the effect of removal of C1 on Ru-Sn catalysts in the hydrogenation of carboxylates and found that the catalyst without C1 was effective for the hydrogenation of carboxylates [7]. Nishiyama et al. [8] have been studying the selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde with Rh-Sn bimetallic catalysts and found that the tin species reduced to a low valent state on the catalyst surface was effective for the hydrogenation of C=O group. In present work the Ru-Sn catalyst prepared from tin 2-ethylhexanoate indicated higher conversion than the catalyst 80 K. Tahara et aL /Applied Catalysis A: General 154 (1997) 75-86 from SnC12. Tin would not be reduced to a low valent state in the presence of C1. The absence of C1 would facilitate the reduction of tin oxide to lower oxidation state in the Ru-Sn catalyst prepared from tin 2-ethylhexanoate [9]. Potassium and Na were detected by EDX analysis in the catalysts prepared from K2SnO3 and Na2SnO3. On the other hand, no alkaline metal was detected in the catalyst prepared from tin 2-ethylhexanoate. The alkaline metal might affect the C=O hydrogenation activity. The catalysts from K2SnO3 and Na2SnO3 showed higher yield of rosin alcohol than tin 2-ethylhexanoate. The effect of starting materials of Sn would be explained by considering the decomposition temperature of each starting material. Tin chloride is decomposed at 520 K, whereas K2SnO3 and Na2SnO3 is decomposed at 413 K [10,11]. These suggest that ease of decomposition of the starting salts is also important for the Ru-Sn bimetallic catalysts. The selectivity of rosin alcohol is the lowest on the catalysts prepared from SnC12. Nishiyama et al. reported that alloying of Rh and Sn was confirmed after Sn was reduced by XRD powder diffraction and TPR study [12]. We have studied the TPR study of Ru-Sn catalyst prepared from SnC12 and found that Ru and Sn were separated on A1203 [9]. In present work tin would not be reduced to a low valent state in the presence of C1 and Ru would not be alloyed with Sn. 3.2. Effect of Sn/Ru ratio The hydrogenation activity would be affected by the surface Sn concentration of the Ru-Sn catalysts. The effect of Sn/Ru ratio was also studied for rosin hydro- genation as shown in Table 3. The -C=C- double bond in rosin was preferentially hydrogenated over the Ru-Sn/A1203 when Sn/Ru ratio is equal to one. Increase of the Sn/Ru ratio to 2, brought about a marked increase of-C=O double bond hydrogenation, whereas the -C=C- double bond was maintained in the obtained rosin alcohol. Further increase of tin (Sn/Ru=3 or 5) somewhat decreased the - C=O hydrogenation activity, and strongly suppressed the -C=C- hydrogenation. The role of tin in bimetallic catalysts has been discussed by many workers. Narashimhan et al. [ 13,14] have suggested that tin preferentially activated -C=O bonds in the hydrogenation of methyl oleate over the Ru-Sn catalysts.

Tahara et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 154 (1997) 7546 81 et al. [ 15] have suggested that the hydrogenation activity of-C=C- on the Ru-Sn catalysts was decreased with decreasing surface Ru concentration in the hydro- genation of unsaturated aldehyde and -C=O groups were actively adsorbed on Sn sites. In this paper, the surface Ru concentration would be decreased with the increase of Sn content. The high Sn surface concentration brought about the decrease of - C=C- hydrogenation activity and the enhancement of-C--O hydrogenation. Because of the higher oxidation enthalpy, which are identical to the heat of formation for the corresponding oxides of tin than that of Ru (RuO2: -239.3, SnO2:-285.8 kJ mol-l), tin should show a stronger affinity to oxygen than Ru [ 16]. These suggest that a high concentration of surface Sn brought about a strong interaction of oxygen atoms in -C=O groups on the catalyst surface. 3.3. Effect of calcination temperature Generally, Ru catalysts are not recommended to be calcined at higher tempera- tures in oxidizing atmosphere, because ruthenium oxides (RuO2 or Ru2OT) are volatile. The calcination was carried out after impregnation of Sn on A1203 in the absence of Ru because of the volatility of Ru oxide. The Sn/AI203 was impreg- nated with Ru compounds followed by reduction in hydrogen stream. Table 4 shows effect of calcination temperature on the activity for rosin hydrogenation. The Ru-Sn/A1203 catalyst just dried at 343 K, without calcination indicated 95% of selectivity of rosin alcohol. When catalysts were calcined in the range between 973 and 1173 K, the selectivity of rosin alcohol reached almost 100%. The Ru-Sn/ AI203 catalyst calcined at 573 K showed a low conversion, whereas the conversion increased with increasing calcination temperature as shown in Runs 4-6 in Table 4. 3.4. Effect of reduction temperature Effect of reduction temperature on the rosin hydrogenation reaction was shown in Table 5. The Ru-Sn catalyst reduced at 573 K showed the low activity.

The catalysts reduced at 723 and 873 K indicated high conversion as shown in Table 5. Nishiyama et al. [8] have studied the selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde with Rh-Sn bimetallic catalysts and have indicated that the tin species reduced to a low valent state was effective for the hydrogenation of C=O groups. They have also reported that the Rh oxide in the catalyst precursor was reduced at 373 K, then the reduction of Sn oxide proceeded at 500 K [12]. The reduced Rh metals played as a catalyst for reduction of the Sn oxides [12] over the SiO2-supported Rh-Sn bimetallic system. We have studied the TPR spectrum of Ru-Sn/alumina catalyst and have indicated that Ru species was reduced at 473 K and Sn species was reduced at 673-773 K [9]. In the present work, the reduction at 573 K seems to be insufficient for the reduction of the Sn oxide on the A1203 support. The higher temperature reduction brought about the reduction of Ru and Sn precursors and mixing to a Ru-Sn bimetallic system. It should be noted that the reduction temperature did not affect the selectivity of rosin alcohol as shown in Table 5. 3.5. Hydrogenation of various carboxylic acids on Ru-Sn/Al203 catalysts The activity of the Ru-Sn/A1203 catalysts was also investigated for the hydro- genation of various carboxylic acids as shown in Table 6. Hexanoic acid was hydrogenated to hexyl alcohol and lauric acid was hydro- genated to lauryl alcohol in high yield (Run 1, 2). 2-Ethylhexanoic acid and cyclohexane carboxylic acid were also hydrogenated to the corresponding alcohols Table 6 Hydrogenation of various carboxylic acids on Ru-Sn-alumina catalysta Run No. Reactant Product Yield (%)b 1 hexanoic acid hexanol 86 2 lauric acid lauryl alcohol 94 3 2-ethylhexanoic acid 2-ethyl hexanol 67 4 cyclohexane carboxylic acid cyclohexanemethanol 74 5 oleic acid stearyl alcohol 76 6 benzoic acid benzyl alcohol 94 a The catalysts were calcined at 973 K and reduced at 723 K. K. Tahara et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 154 (1997) 75-86 83 over the Ru-Sn/A1203 catalysts as shown in Table 6 (Run 3, 4). Oleic acid was hydrogenated to stearyl alcohol and benzoic acid was hydrogenated to benzyl alcohol (Run 5, 6). The branched carboxylic acid (Run 3) indicated a steric hindrance of the hydrogenation. The hydrogenation of unsaturated carboxylic acid (Run 5) mainly gave the saturated alcohol. It should be noted that the hydrogena- tion of benzene ring was completely suppressed over Ru-Sn]A1203 (Run 6). Ruthenium monometallic catalysts, e.g. Ru/AI203, indicated the remarkable activity of hydrogenation of benzene ring [17]. The Ru-Sn bimetallic system showed a selective hydrogenation of carbonyl groups in organic compounds. 3.6. Hydrogenation of rosin on the flow system Few examples have been reported on the hydrogenation of carboxylic acids over the Ru-Sn bimetallic catalysts in a flow system. The Ru-Sn/A1203 catalyst that was calcined at 973 K followed by reduction at 723 K showed a high activity for the hydrogenation of rosin in a fixed-bed reactor as shown in Table 7. The hydrogenation activity for rosin was very high (Run 1) under the condition of 553 K of reaction temperature, 2.45 MPa of hydrogen pressure, 20 N1 h-1 of hydrogen flow, and 0.33 of LHSV. The reaction temperature greatly affected the conversion of rosin (Runs 1-3). The contact time of liquid components, LHSV, did not affect strongly the hydrogenation activity (Runs 2 and 3). Hydrogen flow rate also strongly affected the hydrogenation activity of rosin as shown (Runs 3 and 4) in Table 7. The high flow rate of hydrogen may overcome the diffusional limitation for dissolution of molecular hydrogen to liquid phase. 3.7. Chemisorption of the Ru-Sn/A1203 catalysts Table 8 shows chemisorption capacity of the catalysts for carbon monoxide (CO) and oxygen (02). It is generally known that CO is not chemisorbed on neither Sn nor alumina surfaces irreversibly. It is considered that CO was chemisorbed only on the Ru surface in the Ru-Sn bimetallic system.

A higher oxidation enthalpy of Sn (Ru=-239.3 and Sn=-285.8 kJ mole-1) may explain stable adsorption of oxygen on the Sn sites in the Ru-Sn/AI203 catalysts. The Ru-Sn catalysts in Table 8 had poor capacity for CO adsorption and high capacity for O2 adsorption. The amount of adsorbed CO was decreased by increasing the calcination temperature of Sn/AI203 before Ru impregnation, whereas 02 adsorption capacity was not significantly decreased. It should be noted that the calcination condition before the Ru impregnation affected the CO adsorption capacity of the catalysts. The higher reduction temperature gave the lower CO adsorption capacity, whereas O2 adsorption capacity decreased a little as shown in Runs 3-6 in Table 8. A high temperature reduction would cause sintering of metallic particles on a support. The low adsorption capacity of CO at higher reduction temperature seems to indicate the sintering of Ru particles, while a little decrease of adsorption capacity of 02 suggest that active surface site of Ru-Sn bimetallic particles was not decreased even at the high reduction temperature. Nishiyama et al. have reported the reduction behavior of Rh-Sn/SiO2 catalysts during the activation of the catalyst precursor by TPR technique [12]. The reduction of Sn oxide in the catalyst precursor of Rh-Sn/SiO2 catalysts proceeded just after the reduction of Rh salt (or Rh oxide) to metallic Rh. The reduction of Sn oxide required at least 473 K of reduction temperature [ 12]. When the Rh-Sn/SiO2 catalyst precursor was reduced at higher than 673 K, alloying of Rh and Sn was confirmed by XRD powder diffraction [12]. These results indicate that the decrease of adsorption capacity of CO was ascribed not to the sintering of Ru particles but to alloying of Ru and Sn by reduction of Sn oxide in the catalyst precursor. Verbeek [18] and Bouwman [19] reported that the surface Sn concentration of the Pt-Sn catalysts increased with calcination temperature, whereas it decreased with reduction temperature. We have reported that the activity for C=O hydro- genation increased with reduction temperature on Rh-Sn catalyst [2]. Masai et al. [20] suggested that hydrogen adsorption ability of the supported Rh and Ru catalysts was decreased by alloy formation with Sn. K_ Tahara et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 154 (1997) 75-86 85 The Ru-Sn/A1203 catalyst which was activated by calcination at 1073 K and reduction at 723 K indicated high activity for hydrogenation of rosin as shown in Tables 3 and 4. The site with high activity has poor capacity for CO adsorption and high capacity for 02 adsorption. Ru/A1203 catalyst indicated the high CO adsorption capacity (3.64 ml gcatal. 1). The high temperature calcination and reduction brought about mixing between Ru and Sn. The obtained Ru-Sn/ A1203 catalysts indicated high selectivity of rosin alcohol. The previous paper indicated that low temperature reduction lower than 573 K brought about separation of Ru and Sn oxide because of insufficient reduction temperature in order to reduce Sn oxide to metallic Sn for alloying. The well-mixed Ru-Sn surface is suitable for the hydrogenation of rosin to rosin alcohol. 4. Conclusions 1. The Ru-Sn/A1203 bimetallic system is one of the effective catalysts for selective hydrogenation of C=O group in carboxylic acids. 2. The kind of tin compound for the preparation of the bimetallic catalyst played a significant role in hydrogenation activity of C=O. The effective materials are (Bu3Sn)20, K2SnO3, and Na2SnO3. 3. The C=O hydrogenation activity increased and the C=C hydrogenation activity decreased with increasing Sn/Ru ratio. 4. The calcination and reduction temperatures also markedly affected the activity in the catalyst preparation. The C=O hydrogenation activity was increased by increasing the calcination and reduction temperatures. 5. In a flow system, the Ru-Sn/A1203 catalyst also showed high activity under mild conditions.

Heterogeneous RuSn catalysts are effective for the liquid-phase hydrogenation of CO group in car☐ylic acids. Hydrogenation activity was affected by the kind of tin compounds used for the preparation of the RuSn catalyst. Bis-tributyl tin oxide ((Bu3Sn)2O), K2SnO3 and Na2SnO3 were found to be the appropriate materials for the hydrogenation of CO group over the RuSn catalysts. The CO hydrogenation activity for the hydrogenation of car☐ylic acids increased with the increasing amount of Sn added whereas, the CC hydrogenation activity decreased. Effect of activation temperature was also studied. The CO hydrogenation activity was increased by calcinating the catalyst precursor, Sn/alumina, before impregnation with Ru solution. The calcination of the Sn/alumina at 973 K was quite effective for the hydrogenation of car☐ylic acids over the resultant RuSn/alumina catalysts. The RuSn/alumina catalysts reduced at 723 K were also effective for the hydrogenation of car☐ylic acids. We have also studied the hydrogenation in a continuously flowing system. The RuSn/alumina catalysts showed high and stable activity under mild conditions in the flowing system. Keywords RuSn catalysts Hydrogenation Car☐ylic Acid References [1] Connor R. Folkners K.
