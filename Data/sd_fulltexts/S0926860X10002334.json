Letter to the Editor Reply to the comments on “NO2 − adsorption onto denitration catalysts” Akane Miyazaki ⁎ Toru Asakawa Ioan Balint Japan Women's University, Department of Chemical and Biological Sciences, 2-8-1 Mejirodai, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 112-8681, Japan ⁎ Corresponding author. Comments on our paper [1] are published as a ‘Letter to the Editor’ [2] in this issue of Applied Catalysis A: General. The comments are concerning citation and experimental data shown in the paper. Below, we would like to reply to the critical comments. It is still a matter of debate whether catalytic reduction is a realistic way to treat nitrates in drinking water. For researchers investigating catalytic reduction of nitrate activity as well as selectivity is the most critical aspect. In our paper we cited three references, having opposite opinions concerning the potential of catalytic denitration. Then the following sentence was introduced “Conversion over denitration catalyst must be sufficiently high to overcome the regulation limits, and this is one of the critical point that would allow or prevent practical applications.” We believed it is fair to cite two different opinions upon the potential application of catalytic denitration in practice. The impression is that the criticism on our work is mainly the result of contradicting opinions among different research groups working in this field. We performed NO2 − adsorption onto alumina several times to confirm the accuracy of experimental data. The data shown in Fig. 3 represent one of the series of adsorption experiments onto alumina and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. The slight difference between the NO2 − equilibrium amounts of 0.62 and 0.54mmolL−1 highlighted by Bevia [2] can be explained by the experimental errors associated to the colorimetric determination of NO2 − concentrations. However, the Langmuir-type adsorption can be easily recognized in Fig. 3 for all materials investigated. On the other hand, the kinetic aspects of NO2 − adsorption onto alumina need further investigation. Finally, we would like to correct the unit of NO2 − density in Table 1 from [molg−1] to [mmolg−1] and to thank for the critical review. References [1] A. Miyazaki T. Asakawa I. Balint Appl. Catal.
