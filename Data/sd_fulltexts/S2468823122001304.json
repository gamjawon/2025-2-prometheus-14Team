Structured catalysts are emerging as active and durable catalysts in dry reforming of methane due to their inherent characteristics like lattice insertion of active metals and consequent stability imparted. Here we report Ti and Zr substituted Gd2B2-xNiyO7-δ (B = Ti, Zr) catalysts synthesized by citrate gel method, which are characterized and tested for dry reforming of methane. Structure and Ni substitution has been confirmed by Rietveld refinement of powder XRD patterns and Raman analysis. TPR and CO2-TPD were performed to analyze the reducibility and effect of basic sites of catalysts in DRM activity. Ni doped Ti analogue shows stable and superior activity towards dry reforming of methane for 100 h. The in situ IR studies and XPS analysis confirmed the presence of surface hydroxyl species in this catalyst, which triggers the activation of CO2 and provides higher and durable activity in dry reforming reaction. Absence of any C formation in this catalyst after durability test indicates the mechanism of C gasification by the surface hydroxyl species enhancing stable activity for long durations. Graphical abstract Image, graphical abstract Keywords Ternary metal oxide Dry reforming of methane A2B2O7 Citrate gel method 1 Introduction The increase in global average temperature is attributed to an alarming upsurge in the greenhouse gas emissions, especially CO2. To address this issue, several reactions converting CO2 to useful products have been reported, viz., hydrogenation, reforming, methanation, carboxylation etc [1]. Among them, CO2 reforming has attracted more attention since it utilizes two greenhouse gasses, CO2 and methane, to generate valuable syngas (1). In particular, dry reforming of methane (DRM) generates syngas with H2/CO ≈ 1 at thermodynamic equilibrium using CO2 and CH4 [2]. Generated syngas can be further used for the synthesis of DME or long chain hydrocarbons by FT synthesis [3,4]. (1) CH4 + CO2 ↔ 2CO +2H2 (ΔH°298 K = +247 kJ/mol) Most of the catalysts reported for this process are based on Ni supported on basic oxides, well known for steam reforming. Although, Ni based catalysts show superior activity at steam reforming conditions, they are prone to severe coke formation under dry reforming conditions, caused by two reactions, Boudouard reaction (2) and methane cracking (3) at temperatures around 550 °C and 700 °C respectively [5,6]. (2) 2CO ↔ C(s) + CO2 (ΔH°298 K = −171 kJ/ mol) (3) CH4 ↔ C (s) + 2H2 (Δ Ho 298K = +75 kJ/ mol) Another major drawback of supported metal catalysts, especially Ni, is the sintering of active metal nanoparticles at high temperature thereby compromising number of active sites in the catalyst [7]. Several suggestions to minimize these problems are documented and it has been observed that high dispersion and smaller particles of the active Ni with good metal support interaction can limit sintering as well as coke formation [8]. Support characteristics like redox property, basicity etc. also influence the activity and durability of the catalyst. Recently, the concept of stabilizing active metal sites as ionic lattice sites in stable structured oxides, to prevent sintering and coke formation has been attracting attention. A2B2O7 ternary oxides form a potential family of compounds for various reforming reactions due to their high thermal stability and tolerance to structural variations and lattice site doping. These analogous compounds are known to have various structure types like pyrochlores and defect fluorite. Effect of different parameters viz., A and B site substitutions in these structure types and oxygen vacancies have been studied for gasification, reforming and coupling reactions etc. Most of the reports are on lanthanum zirconate pyrochlore and noble metals like Rh, Ru and Pt as well as Ni have been studied as active metal [9–14]. Apart from this, the effect of Rh doping in the kinetic parameters of dry and bi reforming of methane is also analysed [15–18]. In this paper, we report B site substituted Gd based ternary metal oxides and compared their activity and durability in dry reforming of methane. Unsubstituted and Ni substituted Gd2B2O7 (B = Ti and Zr) have been synthesized by conventional citrate gel method. Structure-activity correlation by various characterization techniques and spent catalyst analysis suggests that structured ternary metal oxide catalyst with Ti has superior activity and is stable for dry reforming of methane. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis All structured catalysts were synthesized by conventional Pechini method. Metal nitrate precursors were dissolved in minimum amount of distilled water separately, mixed together and then added to citric acid solution with the ratio of 3:1 (citric acid: nitrate precursors) under constant stirring at 80 °C. For Gd and Ti, Gd2O3 and Ti isopropoxide were dissolved in conc. HNO3 before mixing with citric acid. Gd:B:Ni molar ratio in the solution was 1:0.96:0.099 for Ti compound whereas for Zr analogue, it was 1:0.898:0.099. Ethylene glycol was added to the solution as polymerizing agent with molar ratio of 1:1 (EG:CA). Formed gel was dried overnight at 180 °C to promote polyesterification and removal of water. The obtained fluffy material was crushed and calcined at 800 °C for 6 h in air to get the ternary metal oxides. 2.2 Characterizations Powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the parent and Ni substituted Gd2B2O7 (B = Ti and Zr) catalysts were collected using PANanalytical X'pert Pro-dual goniometer diffractometer equipped with an X'celerator solid-state detector. Nickel filtered Cu Kα (1.5418 Å) radiation was used for the data collection using a flat holder in Bragg-Brentano geometry with 1° slit at the source side. The data were recorded in 2θ range (10–90 °) in step size of 0.008 ° GSAS EXPGUI suit was used for Rietveld refinements of powder XRD pattern. First, refinement was carried out by fixing the stoichiometry of B site as in the synthesis and NiO secondary phase was quantified. Then refinement was done again by fixing the Ni occupancy based on the difference of Ni concentration added during synthesis and that present as NiO. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of the samples were measured by N2 sorption at liquid nitrogen temperature (−196.15 °C) using a Quantachrome Autosorb iQ equipment. Prior to N2 adsorption, the samples were degassed at 300 °C for 3 h to remove any residual moisture and other volatiles. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) profiles were obtained using a Micromeritics Autochem 2920 catalyst characterization system, equipped with TCD detector. Freshly calcined samples were treated in 5% O2-He gas mixture (30 mL min−1) by ramping the temperature to 400 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. Following this heat treatment for 1 h, the sample was cooled to 50 °C in Ar (purity 99.995%) flow. Subsequently, the gas was changed to 30 mL min−1 of 5% H2 in Ar flow and the catalyst was heated to 1000 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The change in H2 concentration at the outlet was monitored by TCD and plotted against temperature to get TPR profiles. Water produced during the reduction process was condensed and collected in a cold trap. Temperature programmed desorption of CO2 (TPD- CO2) was carried out on a Micromeritics Autochem 2920 equipped with a TCD detector. The samples were first degassed at 300 °C in 40 mL min−1 of He flow for 1 hour. Then the sample was cooled to 50 °C in He, and the gas was switched to 30 mL min−1 of 10% CO2 in He for 30 min. Following this, the sample was purged with He for 30 min by ramping the temperature to 100 °C at 5 °C min−1 in order to remove the physisorbed CO2. Subsequently, the sample was heated at 10 °C min−1 to 1000 °C under He flow (40 mL min−1) while monitoring the TCD signal for desorbed CO2. Raman spectra were recorded using Horiba JY Lab RAM HR 800 Czerny-Turner type spectrograph equipped with 800 mm focal length achromatic flat field monochromator and charge-couple device (CCD) detector. The wavenumber region (200–2000 cm−1) was scanned using a He-Ne laser (632.8 nm, 20 mW). The in situ FTIR spectra were collected using Nicolet iS50 Analytical FTIR Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in diffuse reflectance mode (DRIFT) equipped with MCT detector. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using K-Alpha+ model Thermo Fisher Scientific (UK) make XPS instrument with an Al Kα source. XPS data of all the compounds were fitted with the Shirley type background subtraction method using XPSPEAK41 software. Quantitative analysis of coke formation in spent catalysts performed by Thermogravimetric analysis in Perkin Elmer TGA/DTA model instruments by heating the sample to 1000 °C in air flow at 10 °C min−1, using the weight loss in a defined region was used to estimate the coke content. 2.3 Catalysis The dry reforming reactions were carried out in a packed-bed tubular down flow reactor made of Inconel HT, placing it in a programmable tubular furnace. All the gasses (CH4, CO2 and N2) used for the reaction were regulated by mass flow controllers (Brooks Instruments). 0.5 cm3 (0.6–0.75 g) of 0.3–0.5 mm range catalyst particles were mixed with 0.5 cc of same size quartz pieces and loaded in the reactor tube supported by ceramic wool plugs. The catalyst bed temperature was measured by chromel-alumel thermocouple centered in the catalyst bed. Prior to the reaction, the catalyst was calcined at 700 °C for 5 h and reduced in situ at 700 °C for 5 h using 20% H2 in N2 gas mixture. DRM reaction was carried out using a gas mixture consisting of CH4, CO2 and N2 in the volume ratio of 1:1:1; with flow rate 80 mL min−1 with total gas hourly space velocity at 28,800 h − 1. The product gas mixture was analyzed by online gas chromatograph (Chemito 8610) equipped with a Spherocarb packed column (1/8″ OD and 8 feet length). CH4 and CO2 conversions and the H2/CO ratio were calculated using the gas composition analyzed by GC and conversions were calculated by the formulae, CH4 Conversion: XCH4% = [(FCH4 in - FCH4 out)/FCH4 in] x 100 CO2 Conversion: XCO2% = [(FCO2 in - FCO2 out)/FCO2 in] x 100 H2/CO ratio: H2/CO = [Fout H2/Fout CO] 3 Results and discussion Our strategy was to identify structural frameworks with stable ions which form the basis for lattice insertion of active metals. A2B2O7 compounds with B site occupied by Zr and Ti were anticipated to provide stable skeletal framework as well as provide catalytically active sites through a synergistic interaction of Zr and Ti with Ni ions. The materials were synthesized by conventional Pechini method and phase analysis was carried out by PXRD (Fig. 1 (A)). Gd2Zr2O7 (GZO) crystallized in defect fluorite structure with Fm 3 ¯ m space group (PDF 01–080–0471), while Gd2Ti2O7 (GTO) crystallized in pyrochlore structure with Fd 3 ¯ m space group (PDF 01–073–1698). Ni doping (named as GTNO and GZNO for substitution in Ti and Zr compounds respectively) seems to have minimal effect on the structure type and parent structures are retained, with small amount of NiO present as impurity outside the lattice as indicated by the peak at 43.2° [19,20]. The XRD patterns also show a small shifting of peaks in Ni doped catalysts towards high 2θ values, pointing to a contraction of lattice. This is further confirmed by full pattern refinement by Rietveld method using GSAS-EXPGUI software [21]. For GZO, refinement was done with defect fluorite Gd2Zr2O7 model, with Fm 3 ¯ m space group (ICSD collection code - 068,265). Refinement went smoothly and resulted in a good fit with cell parameter a = 5.3008 Å, which is in agreement with the literature data [19]. For GTO, the refinement analysis confirmed a face centered cubic lattice system with Fd 3 ¯ m space group (ICSD collection code- 024,207) with cell parameter a = 10.1861 Å. With Ni doped catalysts, quantitative analysis shows that 1.34 wt% and 0.68 wt% of Ni is present outside the lattice as NiO, in GTNO and GZNO respectively. Refinement studies were carried out by substituting appropriate concentrations of Ni (subtracting the Ni concentration present outside the lattice) in Zr and Ti sites and cell parameters were refined to be 5.2678 and 10.1842 Å for GZNO and GTNO respectively. The decrease in cell parameters of substituted catalysts confirms the incorporation of Ni in Ti and Zr sites. Lattice site substitution of Ni in Ti analogue is obviously lower due to the higher concentration of Ti added, which in turn has led to a higher concentration of NiO outside the lattice, in a well dispersed manner. Crystallite size of main phases was calculated by Lorentian broadening of refined XRD peaks. Refined profiles and parameters are given in Fig. S1 (A-D) and Table 1 respectively. Atomic parameters are given in Table S1. In general, surface area of the materials is low as expected due to the high temperature synthesis (Table S2). Substitution of lower valent Ni in the lattice is expected to affect the stoichiometry and hence form and redistribute O occupancy and vacancies. Since scattering parameters of O is low in x-ray diffraction methods, we have refrained from refining O occupancy in Rietveld analysis. However, an attempt to understand O occupancy and vacancy distribution in the catalysts through Raman spectroscopy was carried out (Fig. 2 (A)). Pyrochlore structure is known to have 6 active Raman modes distributed as A1g+Eg+4F2g irreducible presentations [22–24]. The A1g mode corresponds to Ti-O stretching, at higher frequencies (515–530 cm−1) and Eg modes are due to O-Ti-O bending motion (330 – 340 cm−1), while the F2g modes are due to O-Ti-O bending (300–320 cm−1) and vibration of Gd-O’ lattice (200–250 cm−1). For GTNO catalyst, Raman modes around 215, 310, 449, 519 and 715 cm−1 were observed. Bands around 710–750 cm−1 are attributed to the defect originated oxygen disorder confirming the occurrence of oxygen vacancy in GTNO catalyst [22]. While in GZNO catalyst, broad Raman bands have been observed in the range of 300–350 cm−1, the broadness of Raman modes confirm the defect fluorite structure of the catalyst [25]. According to Glerup et al., the absence of broad peak at 750 cm−1 confirms the lack of disorder generated oxygen vacancies in GZNO catalyst. Difference in reducibility of both the catalysts was ascertained by TPR analysis. It can be seen from Fig. 2(B) that, in GZNO two reduction peaks were observed at around 459 °C and 559.6 °C. The first peak corresponds to the reduction of surface NiO particles and the second peak at 559.6 °C is owing to the lagged reduction of Ni+2 → Ni0 present in the sub surface layers of the support [26,27]. In case of GTNO, the reduction of NiO particles on the support surface occurs at much lower temperatures in the range of 350 – 410 °C, possibly due to better dispersion. The peak in the range of 480 - 500 °C corresponds to the reduction of NiO, which is strongly interacting with the support. Along with this, reduction peaks centered at 630 °C and 700 °C suggested the reduction of lattice Ni2+ into metallic Ni [28]. On comparing both the materials, it can be concluded that GTNO has more reducible Ni species over the surface as well as in sub layers of support. Surface acidic/basic nature also plays an important role in DRM, since CO2 is acidic in nature; higher the basicity of support, more CO2 is adsorbed activating CO formation and further dry reforming of methane. This was estimated by CO2-TPD experiments (Fig. S2) and in GTNO, the desorption peaks are observed in lower temperatures as well as in higher temperature range which confirms the presence of weak, medium and strong basic sites facilitating activation of CO2. While in GZNO catalysts, the broad peaks observed at around 200 °C indicates the presence of weak basic sites resulting in less desorption and activation of CO2 [29,30]. To understand the surface composition of metals in the catalysts, XPS analysis has been carried out (Fig. 3 ). In GTO (Fig. S3) and GTNO catalyst, Ti 2p XPS spectrum showed the presence of Ti+4 through binding energy peaks at 458.1 and 463.8 eV [31]. Interestingly, we also observed a small peak at 456.6 eV which can be attributed to reduced Ti species [32]. The concentration of this reduced Ti species on the surface, however, decreased on Ni doping. The O 1 s spectrum of GTNO catalyst displays two peaks at 529.2 eV and 531.9 eV corresponding to the surface adsorbed oxygen (O −) and hydroxyl oxygen (OH−) species respectively [31]. The ratio of surface adsorbed oxygen (O −) and the hydroxyl species (O −: OH−) was estimated from the area under the peaks and is found to be 9:1 in GTO while in GTNO catalysts it is 7:3. This confirms the enhanced generation of hydroxyl species by Ni substitution in Ti site. In case of GZNO catalyst (Fig. 3), the Zr 3d XPS profile showed peaks at 182.5 eV and 184.9 eV confirming Zr in +4 valence state [33]. The O 1 s spectrum shows the binding energy at 529.1 eV indicating only loosely bound surface oxygen species and the lower binding energy peaks correspond to lattice oxygen atoms (Fig. S3). It is noteworthy that in GZNO, peak corresponding to hydroxyl oxygen species at 531.9 eV is missing. Furthermore, we performed DRIFT experiments to understand the adsorbed species on the surface of these catalysts upon exposure to CO2. Before the analysis, the sample was heated inside the DRIFT cell in N2 at 400 °C to clean the surface. Following this, the sample was reduced in H2 (20 mL min−1) for 2 h and later the cell chamber was purged with N2 at 400 °C for 30 min. H2 is expected to be homolytically dissociated and adsorbed on the catalytically active sites and N2 purge would sweep away any H2 not anchored on the surface. Then a mixture of N2 (20 mL min−1) and CO2 (5 mL min−1) was passed over the sample and spectra were recorded at 400 °C in absorbance mode. The spectra show the presence of carbonates (symmetric stretching OC-O and CO) and formate species in the range of 1300–1600 cm−1 (Fig. 4 (A)). Formate species are formed because of interaction between CO2 and adsorbed H* on the surface Fig. 4.(C) shows the absorption bands at 3630 cm−1 and 3735 cm−1, which correspond to the hydroxyl species; however, gaseous CO2 also shows absorption in the same range and hence this cannot be conclusively assigned. The desorbed gaseous CO has been observed at 2143 cm−1 in Fig. 4(B) [34,35]. The peak at 2143 cm−1 is more intense in GTNO than GZNO catalyst, as the desorption of gaseous CO is more in GTNO catalyst which triggers the fast activation of CO2. The less desorption of CO in GZNO shows lesser activation of CO2. The activity for dry reforming of methane of both the Ni substituted catalysts have been studied at various temperatures (Fig. S4) and durability was tested at optimized reaction conditions at 800 °C, 28,800 h − 1 GHSV, CO2: CH4: N2 = 80:80:80 mL min−1 and atmospheric pressure for 100 h time on stream (Fig. 5 ). Among the two catalysts, GTNO showed superior DRM activity. Initial activity of both the catalysts was poor and reached steady state conversions after 35–40 h. Initial poor activity was also accompanied by H2/CO ratio much less than what is expected of DRM. It has been reported that, the decrease in H2/CO ratio may be because of side reactions like reverse water gas shift reaction (4) and reverse Boudouard reaction at high reaction temperature (800 °C) (5) [36]. In case of GTNO, the activity recovers to 94% CO2 and 88% CH4 conversion and 0.96 (∼1) H2/CO ratio, whereas, GZNO exhibited much lower activity at maximum conversion. (4) CO2 + H2↔ CO + H2O (ΔH°298 K = +40.6 kJ/mol) (5) 2CO ↔ C(s) + CO2 (ΔH°298 K = −171 kJ/ mol) It is understood that the surface oxygen species play a key role in gasification of coke formed during the dry reforming reaction by converting it into CO. The XPS and in situ IR studies confirm the presence of these species, especially hydroxyl in GTNO catalysts. These active groups prevent blockage of active sites by carbonaceous species and make the active sites available for further reaction. We can anticipate this mechanism of coke removal from GTNO catalyst surface. The absence of hydroxyl species in GZNO catalyst may be the reason for its decreased activity by accumulation of carbonaceous compounds. In order to check the structural change and the stability of Ni substituted catalysts after 100 h of reaction, the x-ray diffraction analysis of the spent catalysts was carried out. All two spent catalysts retained their parent structure after 100 h time on stream in DRM conditions (Fig. 6 A). An extra peak in case of GZNO catalyst at 2θ, 26.2° (JCPDS No.75–1621) is attributed to graphitic carbon [36]. To further substantiate the presence of graphitic carbon, Raman analysis of spent GTNO and GZNO catalysts was done (Fig. 6B). Raman spectrum of GZNO catalyst showed bands at around 1350 cm−1 and shoulder peak at 1615 cm−1 corresponding to D and G bands of disordered graphitic carbonaceous species [36]. For the estimation of the amount of carbon formed during the dry reforming of reaction, thermogravimetric analysis was also done on the spent catalysts. The experiment was carried out under air and oxidized carbon was calculated in moles per gm of catalyst (Fig. 7 ). It has been observed that the GZNO showed more coke formation in comparison with GTNO. From the above characterization studies, it can be inferred that structural and other factors like reducibility assist GTNO to be more active and stable in dry reforming conditions. Presence of more hydroxyl species as well as reduced Ti species possibly play very important roles in enhanced CO2 activation. Presence of well dispersed NiO particles on the surface of GTNO could have enhanced the reducibility and hence activity. Surface hydroxyl groups on the surface could also influence gasification of the C formed resulting in further enhancement of activity and stability. 4 Conclusions The Gd based Ni substituted ternary metal Ti and Zr oxide catalysts have been synthesized and tested for dry reforming of methane. The XRD analysis and refinement studies confirm the incorporation of Ni in the lattice as well as presence of reducible NiO over the surface resulting in enhanced activity of the Ti based Ni doped catalyst. Temperature programmed reduction confirms that the reducibility of this catalyst is more than the Zr analogue, which substantiates the presence of well dispersed NiO particles over the surface and presence of stable active metal ions in the bulk. Strong basicity of GTNO catalyst also results in the promotion of CO2 adsorption and activation than in GZNO catalyst towards DRM. This is corroborated by in situ IR studies which prove more reductive adsorption and desorption of CO2 as CO on GTNO. Presence of loosely bound surface oxygen and hydroxyl oxygen species in GTNO catalyst may also be helpful in activation of CO2 as well as simultaneous coke gasification on the GTNO catalyst surface. Amount of carbon formed in dry reforming of methane is less in GTNO than GZNO catalyst and absence of graphitic carbon shows the simultaneous removal of coke from the surface of GTNO catalyst and availability of active sites for DRM. This study unveils the influence of reducibility, basic strength of support and formation of defect modified oxygen as well as hydroxyl species for the superior and stable activity of GTNO catalyst towards dry reforming of methane.

        "dc:description": "Structured catalysts are emerging as active and durable catalysts in dry reforming of methane due to their inherent characteristics like lattice insertion of active metals and consequent stability imparted. Here we report Ti and Zr substituted Gd2B2-xNiyO7-δ (B = Ti, Zr) catalysts synthesized by citrate gel method, which are characterized and tested for dry reforming of methane. Structure and Ni substitution has been confirmed by Rietveld refinement of powder XRD patterns and Raman analysis. TPR and CO2-TPD were performed to analyze the reducibility and effect of basic sites of catalysts in DRM activity. Ni doped Ti analogue shows stable and superior activity towards dry reforming of methane for 100 h. The in situ IR studies and XPS analysis confirmed the presence of surface hydroxyl species in this catalyst, which triggers the activation of CO2 and provides higher and durable activity in dry reforming reaction. Absence of any C formation in this catalyst after durability test indicates the mechanism of C gasification by the surface hydroxyl species enhancing stable activity for long durations.",
