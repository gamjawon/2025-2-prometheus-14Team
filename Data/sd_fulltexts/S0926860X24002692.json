Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR) is a promising approach to accomplish the CO2 net emission. Ni-based single-atom catalysts (Ni-SACs) with the Ni-N-C structure have been the hotspot in this field. However, its catalytic activity is still unsatisfied. Regulation of the coordination environment of the active site via heteroatom doping is an efficient strategy to improve its catalytic characteristics and activity. Herein, the heteroatom phosphorus is introduced into the N-doped carbon supporter to form Ni-SA/CN-P catalyst achieving the CO Faraday efficiency of 91.8 % at a potential of -1.1 V along with the CO current density 91.2 mA cm-2 in the flow cell, which is superior to the sample Ni-SA/CN without P dopant. It is attributed that the more defects are built in the Ni-SA/CN-P catalyst due to the different atomic radiuses of P and N atoms. Moreover, the gap between d-band center and Femi energy level is narrowed due to the doped P atoms, which reduces the rate-limiting barrier height leading to the promoted catalytic performance. The cooperation of various items finally results in the overall performance. This work provides a simple method for establishing single-atom catalysts with P doping to improve catalytic performance for CO2RR.

Direct electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) into fuels and valuable chemicals by renewable electricity is one promising approach to address this challenge, while reducing the dependence on the traditional fuels [3–5]. Due to the chemical inertia of CO2, a large overpotential is needed to activate CO2 molecules. Furthermore, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the competing reaction of CO2RR in aqueous condition, is accelerated in the high overpotential, which decreases the energetic efficiency and product selectivity [6,7]. It is desirable to develop the robust and efficient electrocatalysts for CO2RR with the reduced overpotential and enhanced selectivity. Although the electrocatalysts based on the noble metal and rare earth elements display the excellent performance, the high cost and scarcity hinder their practical applications [8–11]. Transition metal single-atom catalysts (SACs) based on the nitrogen-doped carbon materials have emerged as the potential alternatives with excellent stability and low cost. However, it is challenging to achieve the comparable activity with the noble metal electrocatalysts, especially at the low overpotential. Modulating the charge distribution of metal center in SACs is a feasible and efficient approach to adjust their intrinsic activity. Doping different heteroatoms is a popular strategy to accomplish above goal [12–14]. In most of SACs, the isolated active site was anchored by N heteroatoms within the carbon matrix [15,16]. The P atom is in the same group as the N atom with the similar feature, however, it is rarely employed as the heteroatom to anchor the metal site in SACs. Sun et al. have developed the Fe-based single atom catalyst co-doped by the N and P atoms (Fe-SAC/NPC) achieving the excellent catalytic performance for CO2RR at very low overpotential [17]. Later, the other N,P-codoped Fe-based SAC was fabricated, which presented the Faradaic efficiency of carbon monoxide (FECO) for 98 % at -0.45 V [18]. As compared with the Fe-based SACs, the influence of N and P doped atoms on the Ni-based SACs is obscure and barely explored [19]. In this work, heteroatom P is inserted into an N-doped carbon-supported Ni SACs to form the Ni-SA/CN-P with the aim to boost CO2RR. The Ni-SA/CN-P exhibits the FECO of 96.9 % at -0.8 V and a stable CO partial current density (jCO) of 9.4 mA cm-2 for 18 h in the H-type cell. More impressively, a large current density of 91.2 mA cm-2 along with FECO > 91.8 % at -1.1 V is achieved in the flow cell. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the free energy to form *COOH intermediate is greatly reduced due to the doped P heteroatom. From the theoretical viewpoint, it is attributed that the d band energy shifts toward the Femi energy leading to the less band gap and the accumulated electrons on Ni sites after the P is doped in the carbon matrix. 2 Experimental section Firstly, zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6 H2O 1.722 g), nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6 H2O 0.119 g), and triphenylphosphine (PPh3, 1.773 g) were dissolved in 100 mL methanol. Next, 20 mL methanol containing 2.997 g 2-methylimidazole (2-MeIm) was slowly added to the above mixture and then stirred (500 r min-1) for 12 h at room temperature. Finally, the mixed solution was heated and kept at 70 °C to thoroughly remove methanol and dried at 60 °C under vacuum to obtain Ni, P codoped zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 precursor (Ni, P codoped ZIF-8). The corresponding structure was verified via X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and Raman, as shown in Fig. S1. As shown in Fig. S1b, the characteristic diffraction peaks of the Ni, P codoped ZIF-8 samples partially coincide with those of standard ZIF-8 card (ccdc# 602542), which indicates that the incorporation of Ni(NO3)2/PPh3 has effect on the structure of ZIF-8. Due to the appropriate cavities and small apertures, the ZIF-8 was used as a host to encapsulate the P sources and Ni sources [20,21]. After that, Ni, P codoped ZIF-8 was annealed at a high temperature under the N2 ambient to convert the crystal to disorder carbon matrix. Meanwhile, P and Ni atoms were evenly distributed on the carbon supporter. After that, the as-synthesized Ni, P codoped ZIF-8 was pyrolyzed at 1000 °C for 2 h under nitrogen gas (N2) with a ramping rate of 5 °C min-1. After cooling down to room temperature, the black powder was homogeneously dispersed in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution (60 °C) for 12 h, and washed by deionized water until pH≈7. The resultant catalyst was donated as Ni-SA/CN-P. The schematic representation of Ni-SA/CN-P is plotted in Scheme 1. Ni-SA/CN and CN-P were synthesized by the same approach without PPh3 and Ni(NO3)2·6 H2O, respectively. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of Ni-SA/CN-P The Ni-SA/CN-P catalyst is prepared via two-step process, as shown in Scheme 1. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) images show that the synthesized Ni-SA/CN-P renders an apparent layer structure ( Fig. 1a). No aggregated Ni atoms are observed in the magnified TEM image, as shown in Fig. 1b suggesting that the Ni species is in the form of atomically dispersed Ni atoms in the Ni-SA/CN-P sample. In the high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image (Fig. 1c), the lattice spacing of 0.31 nm indicates the projection of ordered graphene, which is designed to the (002) plane of graphene. On this basis, the aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) is conducted for the direct observation of Ni species (Fig. 1d, e). Since Ni atoms are heavier in comparison to N, P, and C atoms, the bright spots indicate the well-isolated Ni atoms in the carbon matrix. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping confirms the homogeneous distribution of C, N, P, and Ni atoms in the Ni-SA/CN-P (Fig. 1f). According to the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) analysis, the Ni contents of Ni-SA/CN-P and Ni-SA/CN are 0.8 and 1.4 wt% (Table S1), respectively. According to the XPS measurements, the C content, N content, and P content of Ni-SA/CN-P are 94.5, 4.1 and 1.1 at% (Table S1), respectively. The C content and N content of Ni-SA/CN are 90.6 and 7.1 at% (Table S1), respectively. The crystal structures of CN, CN-P, Ni-SA/CN, and Ni-SA/CN-P samples are determined by XRD, which are plotted in Fig. 2a. For all samples, only one broad peak is identified at 24.1°, 22.5°, 24.2°, and 22.4°, respectively, corresponding to the (002) plane of carbon [22]. No characteristic peak related with metallic Ni particles is observed, which is in good agreement with the TEM result. The characteristic peaks of P-doped samples, CN-P and Ni-SA/CN-P, shift to the lower direction relative to the corresponding sample without P element i.e., CN and Ni-SA/CN, unfolding the enlarged lattice spacing. It is attributed that the atomic radius of P atom is the larger than that of N atom. The different atomic radiuses of doped P and N atoms are beneficial to make the defects [23]. The Raman spectra patterns of above samples are measured and shown in Fig. 2b. Two peaks centered at 1355.4 and 1581.3 cm−1 are identified to disorder-induced carbon defects (D band) and graphitic carbon (G band), respectively [24]. The band intensity ratio of the D band to the G band (I D /I G ) could be utilized to judge the defect extent. The I D /I G of Ni-SA/CN-P sample is 1.02, which is greater than that of Ni-SA/CN sample (0.99). The similar order is suitable for CN-P (0.96) and CN (0.95) indicating the lower graphitization and more defects in the P-doped samples. The larger structural defects in Ni-SA/CN-P are favorable to expose the active site and accelerate the mass transfer resulting in the enhanced activity. The Ni-SA/CN-P and Ni-SA/CN samples exhibit the identical Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area with the values of 124.1 m2 g-1 and 821.2 m2 g-1, respectively. The introduction of P results in a larger population of pore size between 3–4 nm, which is easier for the mass transferring and accessing (Fig. S2 and Table S2). To further confirm the chemical state and elemental composition, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is carried out for Ni-SA/CN and Ni-SA/CN-P samples and plotted in Fig. 2c, d, e. All expected elements, C, N, O, P, and Ni elements, are included in the full spectrum (Fig. S3). Four peaks at 397.41 eV, 398.34 eV, 399.79 eV, and 402.39 eV are deconvoluted, which is assigned to pyridinic N, Ni-N bond, pyrrolic N, and graphitic N, respectively [25,26]. After the involvement of P element, all peaks are kept. However, the proportions of different N species are changed. The total N contents of Ni-SA/CN-P and Ni-SA/CN are 4.1 % and 7.1 %, respectively. The contents of four N species in Ni-SA/CN-P and Ni-SA/CN samples are listed in Table S3. Specifically, the atomic percentage of pyrrolic N increased from 36.4 % to 48.6 %, and the graphitic N percentage increased from 8.6 % to 14.0 % after P incorporation. The pyridinic N content decreases from 44.8 % in Ni-SA/CN to 19.6 % in Ni-SA/CN-P implying that some pyridinic N atoms are replaced by P atoms. The P atom is not only doped in the carbon matrix but also form the coordination with Ni metal center [19,27]. The Ni-N content in Ni-SA/CN-P is more than that in Ni-SA/CN unfolding that the P doped is helpful to increase the Ni content in the sample. In the high-resolution P 2p spectrum of the Ni-SA/CN-P sample, five fitted peaks are assigned to P-O (134.9 eV), P-C (132.2 eV), P-grap (131.0 eV), P-Ni (128.6 eV and 129.8 eV), respectively [18,28]. The existence of Ni-P bond also indicates the formation of Ni-P coordination. The high-resolution Ni 2p spectra of Ni-SA/CN-P and Ni-SA/CN are shown in Fig. 2e. Two main peaks in Ni-SA/CN-P sample at 853.71 eV and 871.05 eV correspond to the Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 levels, respectively [29], which shift to the lower binding energy with respect to that of Ni-SA/CN (854.0 and 871.15 eV). The P contents in Ni-SA/CN-P are expected to induce a variation of electron density distribution toward the Ni active sites ultimately leading to the observed shift of the binding energy peak. The electron enrichment of the Ni active sites can improve their capability to donate electrons to the reactants leading to the enhanced electrocatalytic performance. The Ni 2p3/2 peak at 853.71 eV is higher than that of Ni0 (853.0 eV) and lower than that of Ni2+ (855.7 eV) meaning that the oxidation state of Ni species is larger than 0 but less than +2 [30,31]. The Ni atoms are well isolated in the Ni-SA/CN-P sample with the N and P coordination [32]. 3.2 Electrocatalytic performance for CO2RR The electrocatalytic CO2RR performances of above samples are evaluated in a three-electrode H-type cell containing CO2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 electrolyte. Taken the Ni-SA/CN-P as an example, the pyrolysis temperature and content of phosphorous source are firstly optimized. The optimal pyrolysis temperature is 1000 °C along with 3.5 g P sources, as shown in Fig. S4. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) of all samples including CN, CN-P, Ni-SA/CN, and Ni-SA/CN-P is carried out and displayed in Fig. 3a. The current densities of samples with Ni atom are much larger than those without Ni atom suggesting the importance of Ni atom in catalysis. In addition, the Ni-SA/CN-P sample achieves the larger current densities as well as the lower onset potential (-0.6 V) relative to the Ni-SA/CN samples (-0.8 V). It is attributed to the electron rich of doped P atoms and synergistic effect of doped P and N atoms. For Ni-SA/CN-P sample, the maximum FECO reaches 96.9 % at −0.8 V meaning the excellent selectivity. At the same time, the satisfactory FECO, over 90 %, is maintained by Ni-SA/CN-P sample under a broad range from −0.6 to −0.8 V (Fig. 3b). No liquid product is observed in the 1H NMR spectrum plotted in Fig. S5. The current densities for CO production (J CO ) under various potentials are displayed in Fig. 3c. As expected, the J CO of Ni-SA/CN-P catalyst is the highest at all tested potentials as compared with other three samples. In addition, assuming that all Ni sites can be utilized in Ni-SA/CN-P sample, the calculated turnover frequencies (TOFs) for CO reach 1008.7 h−1 at -0.8 V (Fig. 3d) [18], which is superior to most of the results reported in previous literature (Fig. S6). Above results also demonstrate the successful doping of P elements. The different atomic radiuses of P and N atoms are favorable to build the defect, which is already verified by the Raman results. The more defects in Ni-SA/CN-P sample accelerates the reaction process leading to the superior catalytic performance. Stability is an important item to evaluate the performance of catalysts. Therefore, we performed an 18 h chronoamperometry test at −0.8 V for Ni-SA/CN-P catalyst (Fig. S7a). The current density of −9.7 mA cm−2 and FECO > 90% are maintained throughout the whole operation with a slight fluctuation. On the basis of the XRD (Fig. S7b) and Raman (Fig. S7c) results, the structure of Ni-SA/CN-P catalyst is kept indicating the excellent stability. Furthermore XPS measurement is carried out for Ni-SA/CN-P sample after CO2RR testing and listed in Table S4. The content of P element is 1.1 at% in fresh Ni-SA/CN-P sample, while it reduces to 0.7 at% after the CO2RR test. There is slight loss of P element in Ni-SA/CN-P sample during eletrocatalysis. 3.3 Electrocatalytic performance in a flow cell The CO2 diffusion from the bulk electrolyte to the electrode surface is slow and difficult, which restricts the catalytic process in the H-type cell [33–35]. Hence, the catalytic feature of Ni-SA/CN-P sample is also measured by a tailor-made flow cell with a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) device (Fig. 3e). The Ni-SA/CN-P loaded GDE as the cathode for CO2RR and the anode for the oxygen evolution reaction is made of the commercial IrO2 catalyst coating on a Ti sheet [35,36]. As presented in Fig. 3f, FECO is still over 90 % in a wide potential range from -0.4 V to -1.1 V. When the applied potential is set to be -0.6 V, the highest FECO is almost up to 100 %. The current density of CO in the flow cell (81.9 mA cm-2) is enhanced by 9 times as compared that in H-type cell (9.4 mA cm-2) at the applied potential of -1.0 V. And the maximum CO current density reaches 91.2 mA cm-2 at -1.1 V (Fig. 3g). In addition, Ni-SA/CN-P reiterates its high FECO (greater than 90 %) and maintains well the stable current density during 36 h (Fig. 3h). The Ni-SA/CN-P catalyst realizes high current density, selectivity, and stability exerting the promising potential for electrocatalytic CO2RR. In addition, the performance of Ni-SA/CN-P is also comparable to those of many previously reported electrocatalysts—a detailed comparison is summarized in Tables S5 and S6 in the Supporting Information. 3.4 Mechanism for enhanced electrocatalytic activity To shed light on the intrinsic feature resulting in the superior performance of Ni-SA/CN-P, the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) and Tafel plots are analyzed. The ECSAs are deduced from double-layer capacitance (Cdl) (Fig. S8) in our work. From the results in Fig. 4a, Ni-SA/CN-P exhibits the larger ECSA (76.3 mF cm-2) than those of Ni-SA/CN (51.2 mF cm-2), CN-P (4.4 mF cm-2), and CN (37.7 mF cm-2) indicating more accessible catalytic active sites in Ni-SA/CN-P [37]. It is consistent with the Raman result that more defects are formed in the Ni-SA/CN-P. The Tafel slope at low overpotential regions (Fig. 4b) is 168.5 mV dec−1 for Ni-SA/CN-P suggesting that the rate-determining step (RDS) is the initial electron transfer to produce COOH* intermediate [38,39]. In addition, the lower Tafel slope of Ni-SA/CN-P relative to Ni-SA/CN (183.9 mV dec−1) indicates the enhanced reaction kinetics with the involvement of heteroatom P atom. Subsequently, DFT calculations are carried out to study CO2RR activity and mechanism at the atomic level. To conduct the DFT calculations, two coordination structures (including Ni-N4 and Ni-N3-P anchored to the graphene layer, respectively) are optimized as the models of Ni-SA/CN and Ni-SA/CN-P, respectively (Fig. 4c, d). Generally, the electrochemical CO2 reduction to generate CO is considered to contain the following four steps [37]. Step 1: CO2 molecules are adsorbed on the surface of the active site; then, the electron is transferred to generate the *CO2 − intermediate. Step 2: After a proton-coupled electron transfer step, the *CO2 − intermediate is transformed into *COOH. Step 3: the -OH is attacked by proton and electron to form H2O. Step 4: the *CO dissociates to generate the CO product. Fig. 4e shows the Gibbs free energy of different reaction intermediates. Obviously, the CO2→*COOH step is the rate-limiting step in the CO2RR. For the Ni-N4 model, the protonation of CO2 to *COOH is thermodynamically uphill with a free energy of 1.82 eV. After doping with P atoms, the free energy is decreased to 1.65 eV suggesting that the *COOH formation is easier in the Ni-N3-P mode. In the second and third steps, showing decreasing free energy profiles, CO can be readily obtained after the *COOH transfers to *CO from the active sites for both models. Thus, later two steps are not rate-limiting step. Above theoretical analysis indicates that the doped heteroatom P can facilitate the formation of *COOH, thus contributing to higher activity and selectivity for CO2RR. To further elucidate the intrinsic items to affect the activity, the partial density of states (PDOS) is calculated at the same level and shown in Fig. 4f. The d band center shifts towards the Femi energy leading to the less band energy gap due to the doped P atom. Moreover, the more electrons are distributed on the Ni site after the introduction of P atom, which is favorable for the electron transfer to form the *COOH (Fig. 4g). 4 Conclusion In summary, we have designed atomically dispersed Ni−N−C catalyst tuned with heteroatom P for electrochemical CO2 reduction. Due to the incorporation of P, the catalytic activity and selectivity of Ni-SA/CN-P are higher than that of P-free sample in the H-type electrolytic cell. The theoretical calculation results illustrate that the existence of heteroatom P can decrease the rate-limiting barrier height of CO2 reduction promoting the CO2RR. More important, in the flow cell, Ni-SA/CN-P reaches a maximum current density of 91.2 mA cm−2 with high FECO (91.8 %) at –1.1 V, and outstanding durability (∼36 h). Overall, this work not only paves a promising approach for selectively producing CO from CO2 electroreduction but also provides new insight into catalyst design by heteroatom doping.

        "dc:description": "Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR) is a promising approach to accomplish the CO2 net emission. Ni-based single-atom catalysts (Ni-SACs) with the Ni-N-C structure have been the hotspot in this field. However, its catalytic activity is still unsatisfied. Regulation of the coordination environment of the active site via heteroatom doping is an efficient strategy to improve its catalytic characteristics and activity. Herein, the heteroatom phosphorus is introduced into the N-doped carbon supporter to form Ni-SA/CN-P catalyst achieving the CO Faraday efficiency of 91.8 % at a potential of -1.1 V along with the CO current density 91.2 mA cm-2 in the flow cell, which is superior to the sample Ni-SA/CN without P dopant. It is attributed that the more defects are built in the Ni-SA/CN-P catalyst due to the different atomic radiuses of P and N atoms. Moreover, the gap between d-band center and Femi energy level is narrowed due to the doped P atoms, which reduces the rate-limiting barrier height leading to the promoted catalytic performance. The cooperation of various items finally results in the overall performance. This work provides a simple method for establishing single-atom catalysts with P doping to improve catalytic performance for CO2RR.",
