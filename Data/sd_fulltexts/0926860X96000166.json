The maximum conversion occurs at the 0.6-1.0 wt.% Pt concentration range; increasing further the Pt concentration up to 5.0 wt.% does not increase the conversion of n-hexadecane. At a constant conversion, the selectivity for isomerization and cracking is the same for different levels of Pt. However, the carbon number distribution of the cracked products shows a small shift to higher carbon numbers with increasing Pt loadings. Keywords: Platinum; Sulfated zirconia; Hydrocracking 1. Introduction The 1990 Clean Air Act and its succeeding amendments have caused the US refining industry to reconsider their current strategies to meet the requirements stipulated by the act. The processes of alkylation, isomerization, oligomerization and etherification have found a growing importance in the production of reformulated gasoline.

Keogh et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 140 (1996) 47-57 current commercial catalysts have increased the research to find new catalysts for these processes. The utilization of sulfated zirconia catalysts for these processes has assumed an important role in the search for a stronger acidic property as well as a more stable and environmentally acceptable acid catalyst for these processes. The solid sulfated zirconia catalysts are considered to have superacidity [1,2]; that is, they have acidities greater than 100% sulfuric acid. The presence of noble metals on the sulfated zirconia catalysts enhances the activity and/or stabilities of these catalysts [3,4]. It is accepted generally that Pt is the superior metal [5,6] for promotion of these catalysts, and is most widely used. The state of platinum as well as its function is still a matter of controversy. Wender et al. [7] suggest that platinum provides the metallic role in a bifunctional mechanism. However, Ebitani et al. [8,9] suggested that the promoting effect of hydrogen was due to the generation of strong acid sites via hydrogen dissociation on platinum followed by spiliover and subsequent proton formation. Ebitani et al. also suggests that the unique properties of the Pt/SO4 /ZrO2 catalyst could be due to the fact that a large fraction of the platinum remains in the form of PtO and PtS with very little of Pt in the metallic form. Iglesia et al. [10] presented data to show that the Pt is present as small crystals of PtS. Recent XAFS data show that metallic Pt is present in the catalyst after activation at 650 [11]. Sayari and Dicko have also reported that calcination in air at high temperature produces metallic Pt [12]. Although a great deal of work has been done, and more still needs to be done to define the role and state of Pt in the working catalysts, little work has been done to define the effect of different levels of Pt on the activity and selectivity of these catalysts. The objective of this work was to define the changes observed in the hydrocracking and hydroisomerization of n-hexadecane as a function of Pt concentration. 2. Experimental Zirconium oxide was prepared by rapidly precipitating from a 0.3M aqueous solution prepared from anhydrous ZrCI4 with an excess of NH4OH to a final pH of 10.5. After washing the precipitate thoroughly with water and then with ethanol to remove most of the bound water, the catalyst was dried in air at 120 for 2 to 3 days. The chloride content of the final water wash was less than 3 ppm. Sulfation of this powder was accomplished by slurrying the dried material with 0.5M H2SO4 (t5 mL/g of catalyst). The sulfated catalyst was dried at 120 overnight and ground to a fine powder. The sulfur content of this catalyst was 3.44 __ 0.02 wt.%. The sulfated catalyst was promoted with Pt at concentrations of 0.03, 0.30, 0.60, 1.00, 3.00 and 5.00 wt.%. Pt was added onto the SO4 /ZrO2 catalyst using the appropriate amounts of an aqueous solution R.A. Keogh et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 140 (1996) 47-57 49 of chloroplatinic acid (Colonial Metals, Inc.) with the incipient wetness tech- nique. All of the catalysts were calcined in air using a temperature of 725 for two hours, unless otherwise stated. The use of this temperature was based on previous work which showed that this temperature produced the most active catalyst. In the activity testing experiments with n-hexadecane, the calcined catalyst was placed in a predried reactor directly from the muffle furnace and stored in a desiccator to cool to room temperature (typically 15 rain). The activity testing was done in a dried 25 mL batch microautoclave. The reactions were carried out using a temperature of 150, a 15 rain residence time, 500 psig H2 (ambient), and a n-hexadecane (4 g)/catalyst (2 g) ratio of 2. Anhydrous n-hexadecane (Aldrich) was used in all of the experiments. After the reactors were loaded with the catalyst and feedstock, UHP hydrogen was used to purge the reactor and bring the reactors to the final pressure, The reactors were heated to 150 in a fluidized sand bath and shaken vertically at 400 cycles per minute for the desired residence time. Typical times to reach the reaction temperature was less than two minutes; the heat-up times were the same for the runs so that the conversion during this period should be similar for the various runs. After the completion of the experiment the reactor was cooled to room temperature (typically within 1 rain) and vented into a gas bomb for analysis and the results incorporated into the total product distribution. The liquid reaction products were filtered from the catalyst and stored in a freezer prior to analysis. The gaseous products were analyzed by a dedicated Carle 311H gas chro- matograph. The liquid products were analyzed using a 60 m 0.32 mm DB-5 capillary column (0.25 /~m thickness) installed in a HP 5890 Series II gas chromatograph with FID detectors. Conversion was defined by the disappear- ance of n-hexadecane in the liquid phase; therefore, conversion includes both isomerization and cracking products. Isomerization was based on the sum of the iso-C 16 products and cracking was based on the sum of the products with carbon numbers less than sixteen. Surface areas were obtained using the standard BET method. X-ray diffrac- tion was carried out using a Philips X-ray diffractometer with a graphite crystal monochromator on the diffracted beam path. The radiation used was Cu K c~ at 40 kV and 20 mA. The data were collected at a step width of 0.02 deg, counting 2 s at each step. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Catalyst characterization The sulfated and Pt promoted sulfated zirconia catalysts are amorphous prior to the calcination step. After calcination, all of the catalysts have the tetragonal 50 Table I Catalyst properties R.A.

All of the Pt promoted catalysts have essentially the same XRD pattern. The sulfur contents of the catalysts after calcination are given in Table 1. The catalysts have essentially the same sulfur content (1.01 +_ 0.02 wt.%) indepen- dent of the Pt concentration. Also shown in Table 1 are the surface areas of the catalysts after calcination. The catalysts have essentially the same surface areas (74_+ 7 m2/g). The characterization data obtained for the Pt promoted sulfated zirconia catalysts suggest that the catalysts have the same crystalline phases, sulfur contents and surface areas. Therefore, any changes in the observed activity and selectivity may be attributed to the different concentrations of Pt on the catalysts. 3.2. Hydrocracking and hydroisomerization of n-hexadecane The effect of the concentration of Pt for catalysts activated using the same conditions on the total conversion of n-hexadecane is shown in Fig. 1. The conversion at a very low concentration (0.03 wt.%) or without added Pt is very low. The conversion increases with increasing Pt concentration up to 0.6 wt.%. The conversion of n-hexadecane appears to be a maximum (76.1 wt.%) at this Pt concentration. Further increases in the Pt concentration causes the conversion to decrease to 57.1 wt.% at a loading of 5.0 wt.% Pt. It appears from these data that Pt has a strong influence on the conversion of n-hexadecane and that the optimum concentration of Pt appears to be in 0.6 to 1.0 wt.% range for the maximum conversion of n-hexadecane. Tierney and Wender [13] also reported the effect of Pt concentration (0.2, 0.5 and 1.0 wt.%) on hexadecane conversion using similar conditions in a batch reactor. Their data were similar to that shown in Fig. 1 which indicated an increase in conversion with an increase in Pt concentrations up to 1 wt.%. The authors did not report any results for catalysts with Pt concentrations greater than 1 wt.%. However, Hino and Arata [14] reported the effect of Pt concentra- R.A.

Their data showed a rapid increase in n-butane conversion with increasing Pt concentration. Maximum activity was obtained at Pt concentration of 8.0 wt.%. Increasing the Pt concentration to 10 wt.% showed a rapid decrease in the conversion of n-butane. The selectivity for isomerization and cracking for these catalysts are shown in Fig. 2. It has been shown [15] that the isomerization and cracking yields are a function of conversion independent of the process conditions that produced the conversion level. In Fig. 2, the open symbols represent the selectivities for isomerization and cracking using a Pt loading of 0.6 wt.% and a number of different hydrocarbon/catalyst ratios, total pressures and residence times to vary conversion levels at 150. At the low to intermediate conversions (ca. 2-50 wt.%), the isomerization yields are slightly higher than the cracking yields. For conversions greater than 50 wt.%, the cracking yields show a rapid increase with increasing conversion and the isomerization yields show a corresponding de- crease. The data obtained for the catalysts containing different concentrations of Pt but using the same process conditions are also shown in Fig. 2 (solid symbols). As can be seen, the isomerization and cracking yields obtained for these catalysts fit the curves defined by the data obtained from using the 0.6 wt.% Pt catalyst and a number of different process conditions. The carbon number distribution of the cracked products obtained from the catalysts containing different concentrations of Pt are shown in Fig. 3. At the lower conversions and 52 R.A.

This was activated at 725 in air. The 0.5, 3.0 and 5.0 wt.% Pt catalysts were calcined for 30, 15 and 15 rain, respectively. The conversions obtained were 87.77, 87.01 and 86.98 wt.%, respectively. The results obtained for the isomerization and cracking selectivities (Fig. 4) show that there is very little difference in the isomerization and cracking selectivities for the catalysts promoted with 0.6, 3.0 and 5.0 wt.% Pt. These data suggest that the Pt concentration on the sulfated zirconia catalyst has no significant effect on these selectivities when the conversion levels are the same. The carbon number distribution of the cracked products from the experiments at constant conversion (Fig. 5) show that there are some minor distribution changes in the product slates. The cracked products obtained using the catalyst promoted with the 0.6 wt.% Pt are shifted to lower carbon numbers with the maximum yields at carbon numbers 6 and 7. The maximum yields for the catalysts promoted with 3.0 and 5.0 wt.% Pt occurred at a carbon number of 7. R.A.

The iso/normal ratios versus the cracked products at constant conversion. have much lower iso/normal ratios when compared to the products from catalysts with low hydrogenation activity and higher acidities. The data in Fig. 6 show the total iso/normal ratios for carbon numbers Ca plus C5 (similar to Sullivan's data) and the carbon numbers C4 through C]3 at a constant n-C]6 conversion (ca. 87 wt.%). The iso/normal ratios of both sets of data show a slight decrease with increasing Pt concentration; however, this decrease is small relative to the large range in Pt concentrations. These data also suggest that the hydrogenation function slightly increases over the Pt concentrations studied. It is conceivable that the chloride, added as chloroplatinic acid, may play an active role in determining the catalytic activity. For instance, the loss of chloride during activation may impact defect sites to the zirconia. The activated catalyst contains less than 0.02 wt.% C1. As an approach to learn the role of chloride, a dried SO2-/ZrO2 sample was impregnated with aqueous ammonium chloride to produce the same chloride content as was added during impregnation with chloroplatinic acid to produce 0.6 wt.% Pt. The conversion data for the SO2-/ZrO2 (3.34 wt.%) and the NH4C1 impregnated SO2 /ZrO2 (3.25 wt.%) show that chloride added as NH4C1 has no impact upon the catalytic activity, and by implication, that the increased activity (82.50 wt.%) and/or stability of the Pt-containing material is due to the presence of Pt. The curve shown in Fig. 3 resembles the classic curves reported for the dependence of the conversion upon the metal loading for bifunctional catalysis [17]. Thus, for a given acidic support, the conversion of a naphtha increases almost linearly with metal loading to attain a maximum conversion and then 56 R.A. Keo~h el a[. / Applied Catalysis A.\" General 140 (1996) 47-57 remains constant with further increase in metal loading. In this case, it is viewed that the maximum is attained because the olefin approaches closely or attains the equilibrium concentration. Thus, at low metal loading the low olefin concentra- tion limits the reaction rate. The overall rate increases as the metal loading increases because the olefin production increases to attain the equilibrium value. The further increase in metal loading should not decrease the olefin concentra- tion unless metal particle growth increases so rapidly that the total metal dispersion decreases beyond some critical metal loading. Furthermore, the authors have shown [18] that the Pt (0.6 wt.%) in a catalyst that had been deactivated (low conversion) after 600 h of processing n-hexadecane still has catalytic activity. This was demonstrated by switching from the hexadecane feed to a 1-octene/octane mixture. The 1-octene was completely converted to octane with little concurrent isomerization and cracking of the octane. These data show that the low activity of the catalyst was not due to the deactivation of the metal function. Another reason that conversion could show a decline with metal loading that exceeds the optimum would be for the added metal to cause poisoning of the acid function. 4. Summary The addition of Pt to promote SO4 -ZrO2 catalysts has a strong influence on the conversion of n-hexadecane. The maximum conversion occurs in the 0.6 _+ 0.2 wt,% concentration range, and increasing the Pt concentration up to 5.0 wt.% does not increase the conversion of n-hexadecane. At a constant level of conversion, the selectivity for isomerization and cracking does not change with different levels of Pt promotion. However, the carbon number distribution of the cracked products show a small shift to higher carbon numbers with increasing Pt loadings.

APCATA 96000166 0926-860X(96)00016-6 10.1016/0926-860X(96)00016-6 The effect of Pt concentration on the activity and selectivity of SO4 2−ZrO2 catalysts for the hydrocracking and hydroisomerization of n-hexadecane Robert A. Keogh Ram Srinivasan Burtron H. Davis ∗ Center for Applied Energy Research, University of Kentucky, 3572 Iron Works Pike, Lexington, KY 40511, USA ∗ Corresponding author. Tel. (+1-606) 2570251, fax. (+1-606) 2570302 The addition of Pt to promote the long-term activity of SO4 2−ZrO2 catalysts is showm to have a strong influence on the conversion of n-hexadecane. The maximum conversion occurs at the 0.6–1.0 wt.% Pt concentration range; increasing further the Pt concentration up to 5.0 wt.% does not increase the conversion of n-hexadecane. At a constant conversion, the selectivity for isomerization and cracking is the same for different levels of Pt. However, the carbon number distribution of the cracked products shows a small shift to higher carbon numbers with increasing Pt loadings.
