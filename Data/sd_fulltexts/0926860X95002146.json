II. Magnesia alumina supported catalysts G.E. Vrieland, B. Khazai, C.B. Murchison * Catalysis Lab, Central Research and Development, The Dow Chemical Company, 1776 Bldg, Midland, M148674, USA Received 31 May 1995; revised 23 August 1995; accepted 23 August 1995 Abstract Magnesia alumina spinels and composites have been developed as attrition resistant supports for the magnesium molybdate which selectively oxidizes butane to butadiene. As with the magnesia supports the optimum yields are obtained with 15%-25% MoO3 together with small amounts of alkali metals to minimize carbon oxides. Vanadia is a promoter which allows for lower temperatures and less coking. Designed experiments were used to model and optimize the reaction conditions and the amounts of vanadia/alkali metal. Characterization of these catal, ysts by XRD, SEM and TEM indicates that particles of magnesium molybdate are found on both the occluded MgO and on the magnesium aluminate spinel surface of the alumina matrix. These molybdate particles are larger and more stable than those found on the MgO support. The result is that these catalysts are less active initially but more stable with time than those on MgO.

Introduction A potential new route to styrene based on n-butane as the raw material begins with the selective oxidation of C4's (butane or butenes) to butadiene followed by catalytic cyclization to vinylclyclohexene (VCH) and finally, oxydehydrogenation of VCH to styrene. Since the cost of styrene is dominated by the cost of raw materials and since butane is available in large quantifies at historically low cost, this process would have significant advantages over the existing process based on ethylene and benzene. * Corresponding author.

Vrieland et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 123-145 In a previous paper [ 1 ] we described an excellent catalyst for the oxydehydro- genation of butane to butadiene, namely, highly dispersed magnesium molybdate together with a trace of alkali metal oxide on magnesia support. This material serves as the source of oxygen for the oxidation reaction. The reaction is best carried out in a riser reactor in which the butane feed carries spherical particles of the catalyst up through a hot tube to produce butadiene and a reduced catalyst. The catalyst is re-oxidized in a fluid bed which is well suited to handle this exothermic reaction. However, the collisions of the catalyst spheres with each other and with the walls tend to fracture the spheres and produce fines which are lost to the process. Although the catalyst supported on magnesia is sufficiently active and selective, it is inherently fragile and at temperatures required to fuse it, the surface area is severely reduced. Therefore, other supports or binders are needed to produce a commercially practical catalyst. There are three criteria which must be met for such a catalyst support. Firstly, it must be basic in order to release the butadiene product. Alkenes and dialkenes, in particular, are strongly adsorbed on acid sites and undergo further reactions. The support must not react with the active magnesium molybdate or have undesired activity of its own. Secondly, it must have high particle strength. This needs to result from bonding which occurs in the drying and calcination of a spray dried droplet rather than by mechanical compaction. Thirdly, it must have high surface area which is stable at 600 in the presence of the small amount of water produced in the reaction. Alumina is a well known binder and support for catalysts but it has strong acid as well as basic sites and is therefore unacceptable. However, the addition of magnesia to the alumina system neutralizes the acidity of alumina [ 2,3] without sacrificing its strength or surface area. In this paper we report that the pure mag- nesium aluminate spinel is a good support for the magnesium molybdate, and as a surface coating on alumina supports or composites it also provides excellent attrition resistance. Of the many different catalysts and promoters we have tried, only vanadia added in low levels to the magnesium molybdate is able to increase the activity without significant loss of selectivity to butadiene. In all of the catalysts a specific low level of alkali metal is necessary to remove residual acidity which would lead to loss of butadiene by coking. 2. Experimental 2.1. Equipment and analysis A pulse reactor was used to simulate a transport bed (riser) reactor and this has been described in the previous paper [ 1 ]. Butane pulses were in the range of 5-30 s with butane concentrations of 10%-50% in helium diluent. Gases were collected in Saranbags over several cycles and analyzed. G.E. Vrieland et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 123-145 125 2.2. Catalyst preparation The preparations of the pure spinel, MgA1204 and the composite, MgO- MgA1204, were carried out by rapid mixing of a solution of NaAIO2 with a solution of MgC12 at pH = 9.2-9.6 in the presence of Na2CO3 tO form a precipitate of MgAI(OH)4CO3. This was washed free of CI- and dried. In order to avoid any contamination with CI- we prepared one sample with Mg(NO3)2 rather than MgC12. Also, commercial samples called Cernel 125 prepared by this method were obtained from TAM Ceramics, Inc. The dried samples were pressed iso-statically at 5-10 kpsig, crushed to 14--40 mesh and calcined at 600. A composite catalyst of alumina and magnesia was prepared by blending mag- nesia powder with colloidal alumina. The procedure consists of adding colloidal alumina (Nycol, 20 wt.-%) to MgO ((Magox Super Premium Grade, Premier Refractories and Chemicals Co.) dispersed in water under low shear. The mixture can be spray dried to give a free flowing powder and calcined at 600 for 2 h. The surface stabilized magnesia with a Mg/A1 ratio of 5/1 was prepared as described by Schaper et al. [4]. A solution of Mg(NO3)2\"6H20 and AI(NO3)39H20 was pumped simultaneously with a second solution of K2CO3 into a precipitating vessel at 65 with pH held at 9 with KOH. The precipitate was washed three times with hot water. Spinel supported on a pre-formed alumina is obtained by twice impregnating with concentrated magnesium nitrate hydrate solution followed by calcination at 550. The final support contains 27.7% MgO and has a surface area of 100 m2/ g. The desired loading with molybdenum and alkali metal is obtained impregnating to incipient wetness with ammonium heptamolybdate (AHM) and alkali carbonate solution, drying for 18 h and calcining up to 600 for 3 h. For preparing the catalysts containing vanadium, we found the best procedure was to first dissolve the ammonium metavanadate in a solution of H202 at room temperature rather than with heating. Then the AHM/K2CO3 was added with cooling applied as necessary to keep the temperature from rising. 2.3. Acidity measurement by adsorption of ammonia Ammonia adsorption was measured by passing 5% NH3 in nitrogen for 30 min over a catalyst sample suspended from a Cahn RG Electrobalance followed by purging in N2 for 60 min. The residual weight was considered the chemisorbed ammonia. This cycle was repeated at 40 steps in temperature up to 260. 2.4. Attrition testing The jet cup attrition test developed at W.R. Grace is a standard procedure used in the catalytic cracking industry to give a number called the 'Davison Index'. 126 G.E. Vrieland et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 123-145 Particles are introduced into a cone shaped cup and high velocity carder gas, N2, circulates the particles for 60 min. The index measures the percentage of < 20/xm particles which are generated by attrition. One alteration of the standard test was that dry rather than humidified N2 was used because the MgO in our samples absorbed water and aggregated. 3. Results 3.1. Catalytic activities of the different forms of magnesia-alumina Spinels The very first results were obtained on a sample of the pure spinel, MgA1204, (Cernel 125 from TAM Ceramics Inc.) and spinels with excess MgO. Using 10% butane with a 30 s pulse time and 570, we obtained 39.8% conversion of butane over the pure spinel and 68.8% selectivity to C4 alkenes as shown in column 1 of Table 1. Excess MgO was added to the spinel by impregnation with magnesium acetate with varying amounts of Cs20 and the results in column 2-4 of Table 1 indicate the strong effect of alkali metal both to decrease conversion and to increase selectivity to butadiene. Column 5 shows the results on a catalyst support in which the MgO was incorporated in the original precipitate (Cernel 125M). Finally, in column 6 is a sample with an even greater excess of MgO (from Kyowa Chemical Industry Co., Ltd). Compared at approximately 38% conversion level, the selec- tivities are in the range 74%-79% butadiene. The selectivities for the MgO enriched samples are higher than that for the pure spinel alone which would indicate that the excess MgO does give improved selectivity but the effect is level after the first mole of MgO. It is significant that the spinel itself is reasonably active and selective because the only magnesium available to form magnesium molybdate must be extracted from the spinel itself. These initial results indicated that magnesium aluminate spinels have good activ- ity and selectivity. Unfortunately, we could not prepare attrition resistant spheres from spinels formed by precipitation probably because, like MgO, they are crys- talline materials. Magnesium aluminate composites and magnesia on alumina supports Composite materials formed by gelation of alumina in the presence of magnesia have been described for example by Yoo et al. [5-7] and these can be spray dried to give attrition resistant spherical materials. Examples of results with 30, 40 and 44 wt.-% MgO (where the pure spinel contains only 30%) spray dried composites are given in Table 2 under slightly different conditions, 20% butane, GHSV = 844 h- ~, 10 s pulse and 570. The results are similar for the three with slightly higher conversion and selectivity for the higher loading with MgO. However, these are not pure spinels but rather bonded mixtures of MgO and alumina along with a Table 1 The effect of Cs20 promoter and a comparison of magnesia alumina spinel, spinel- MgOAc and spinel- xMgO Spinel Support Spinel (only) Spinel + Mg(OAc)2 Spinel+ Mg(OAc)2 Spinel+ Mg(OAc)2 MoO3 (%) 24.6 18.8 t8.8 18.8 Cs20 (%) 0.70 0.0 0.25 0.58 MgO (%) 21.0 35.7 35.6 35.4 Surf. area (m2/g) 104.8 90.7 100.0 104.2 Conversion 39.8 48.1 37.9 29.8 Selectivity Butadiene 55.1 48.7 62.8 70.0 Butenes 13.7 8.5 13.5 19.0 Sum C4's 68.8 57.2 76.3 89.1 Ethylene + propene 2.8 1.9 2.2 3.1 CO2 + CO 17.0 26.7 11.4 8.2 Furan + benzene 7.0 9.1 3.9 2.2 Unknown 4.4 5.1 6.2 0.0 Carbon balance 98.2 97.6 97.7 100.8 Spinel.

So even the catalyst with the lowest level of MgO, 30%, contains a MgO phase. Addition of Mg(NO3)2 or magnesium acetate to preformed alumina supports can be used to form the surface spinel and has the advantage of the attrition resistance of the alumina phase. Column 5 shows the result of two additions of magnesia to 700/zm spheres to give a total of 28% MgO in the support. This gives results very similar to the composite catalysts, 31.4% conversion and 83.5% selec- tivity. A single impregnation to give only 15.8% MgO in the support (column 6) is not sufficient to prevent an excess of combustion products. Comparison of magnesia-alumina composites with MgO The spinel based catalysts are active and selective but how do they compare with the pure MgO supports previously reported? Table 3 shows a comparison of rep- resentative magnesium alumina composite supports with the pure MgO. The com- posite in column 2 was prepared from a support prepared by W.R. Grace and represents one of the best examples of this type of catalyst with a slightly higher %K20. Typically the conversion is near to 30%. Column 3 is an example of the preformed alumina catalyst, again with conversion just above 30% and selectivities G.E.

Under the same conditions the MgO supported catalyst gives 61.2% conversion and nearly 80% selectivity. With higher GHSV in order to achieve the same conversion as the composites, the selectivity is 96%. This latter is a more accurate comparison of activity and indicates that pure MgO is 3-4 times more active than the composites. An obvious conclusion is to increase the %MgO in the composite as high as possible to improve activity and still gain stability and strength. Schaper et al. [4] published results on MgO with small amounts of alumina, MgO/AI203 = 5-10, which showed unusually high surface area stability. Table 4 shows results of the 5/1 catalyst containing 63% MgO compared with the normal composite with only 34% MgO. The results are very similar. This result has important implications for our model of these catalysts. 130 G.E.

Effect of MoO3 and Cs20 concentration The effects of %MoO3 and %Cs20 on Cernel 125M composite were explored with just three levels of MoO3 (9%, 18.5% and 28%) and three levels of Cs20 (0%, 0.38% and 1.1%). Fig. la shows an effect of %MoO3 very similar to that previously described for the MgO supported catalysts [ 1 ], namely, a broad maxi- mum in activity in the 15%-25% region dropping off at higher loading of MOO3. We would expect, based on the MgO catalysts, that below the 9% level, the conversion would drop off rapidly. This figure also shows that the surface area per g decreases with %MoO3 while the density remains nearly constant and the loss in total surface area contributes to the loss in activity especially at the higher loadings. Fig. lb shows the effect of %Cs20 on conversion and, as with the MgO supports, the activity decreases significantly with increasing alkali. In order to evaluate the effect of %MoO3 and %Cs20 independent of conversion, the space velocity was varied to obtain a nearly constant conversion of 38%-40%. Under these conditions, Fig. 2 shows that the selectivities to butadiene and Ca alkenes (butenes + butadiene) improve slightly in going from 9% to 18.5% MoO3 G.E.

We used the RS/Discover program (BBN Software Products Corp.) with the circumscribed central composite (CCC) design. An important advantage of this procedure is that one obtains not only a predicted result but also the uncertainty of that result based on the central repeated points. As examples, conversions and C4 selectivities are plotted in Fig. 4a and Fig. 4b vs. temperature at three space velocities. Conversion increases with temperature and decreases with GHSV as one would expect. The effect on selectivity is just the opposite. The uncertainty bars indicate these are significant effects. Very useful are the surface profile plots such as Fig. 5 for conversion, productivity and selectivity as functions of temperature and %butane. Conversion increases primarily with increasing temperature and decreases with increasing %butane. Selectivity decreases with increasing temper- ature and conversion and also with increasing butane. Productivities are highest in the upper right comer of the graph, i.e., at high temperature and butane concentration and also high space velocity. Economic sensitivities will dictate where the minimum cost will be and the exact conditions necessary to achieve that. 3.4. Vanadia promotion As noted previously (see Table 3) the magnesia alumina composite supported catalysts are less active than those supported on MgO. For practical operation of a riser reactor it would be highly desirable to recover this activity by chemical promoters. We have tested many other compounds and promoters and the only element showing promise is vanadium. The addition of vanadia to the molybdenum on magnesia catalyst has been described in the Russian literature [ 8,9]. They find that added vanadia up to 10 wt.-% increases the activity and the amount of available oxygen for either butene or butane oxidation while still providing high selectivity to butadiene. The effect of vanadia was particularly useful when steam rather than an inert gas was used as a diluent. We have explored the effect of added vanadia in many different catalysts includ- ing those on MgO and the result in Table 5 is a clear example of the advantage of vanadia. The sample with 0.85% V205 and nearly the same %Cs20 on the composite support, MgO-MgA1204, provides the same conversion and selectivity as the un- promoted catalyst but at 307 lower temperature. This can be important in the riser reactor because at lower temperatures the vapor phase cracking reaction to lighter hydrocarbons decreases. The typical effect of adding vanadia to a catalyst already containing MoO3 and K is to increase the conversion, decrease the selectivity to C4's and increase the selectivity to COx. But it is not possible by this approach to separate the effect of the conversion increase from the effect of the added V205. Since vanadia promotes activity and alkali metals promote selectivity while inhibiting the activity, there might be an optimum level of the two which would give enhanced activity and selectivity. To explore this possibility required the use of a designed experiment in G.E.

Fig. 6 shows the surface profile for productivity and selectivity to C4's. As expected, the productivity increases with higher %V205 and lower %K while the selectivity is favored by low %V205 and h~gh %K. A balance of these two variables appeared to lie in the area of 2.0% V205 and 0.5% K. Table 6 shows the comparison of samples from the experiment, one without V205 and a second which was closest to the proposed optimum with 1.4% V205 and 0.38% K and then a catalyst with 2.0% V205 and 0.49% K. The catalyst volumes were varied to give the same conversions at the conditions of 70% butane and 580. The conversions of all three catalysts is nearly the same, 38%, and the selectivities are all 67%-68%; however, the productivities have improved from 17.2 #C4/ft3/h for the un-promoted catalyst to 23.3 for the best sample in the designed experiment and 24.2 for the 'optimum' sample. Unfor- tunately, the concentration limit of 2% for V205 in our experiment was too narrow; however, other experiments have shown that levels of V205 over 2% do not give improved performance. G.E.

An unexpected benefit of the vanadia promoted catalysts is that under riser testing they give less coking. We believe this can be explained by the fact that the higher level of alkali metal which is needed to modify the vanadia promotion leads to a more basic catalyst and this minimizes the adsorption and condensation of butadi- ene. 3.5. Catalyst life In the previous paper [ 1 ] we reported that the activity of MgO supported catalysts decreases significantly over the first 100 h. as shown in Fig. 7. Although the mag- nesia alumina supported catalysts are initially less active, they are more stable and maintain their initial activity practically unchanged over long periods of time. Some of the more active samples of magnesia alumina catalysts do lose initial activity during the first 24 h but then remain constant near the conversion level in Fig. 7. However, even though the MgO supported catalysts lose much of their initial activity, they are still more active than the magnesia alumina catalysts after 200 h. The selectivities to C4's of the composites are comparable to those for the MgO catalysts even though one might expect them to be higher because of their lower conversion. G.E.

Attrition resistance The reason for going to the magnesium alumina system was to obtain attrition resistance and, in fact, this has been realized. Results obtained in the Davison- Grace testing laboratories indicates that the Davison Index is typically 5%-10% which is well within the acceptable range for known FCC catalysts. We used our own small attrition testing unit consisting of catalyst particles continuously circu- 142 G.E. Vrieland et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 123-145 Fig. 13.

The attrition losses were less than that from a standard FCC catalyst. 3.7. Characterization Acidity determination by ammonia adsorption as shown in Fig. 8 indicates the effect of addition of MgO and Cs20 to the spinels. The spinel by itself has the G.E. Vrieland et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 123-145 143 greatest adsorption of ammonia and therefore the greatest acidity. Addition of magnesium acetate (Mg-Spinel) reduces the acidity significantly while addition of molybdenum gives little change. Cs20 reduces the acidity by 30%-40% but MgO is still the least acidic as one might expect. The magnesium molybdate particles in a freshly calcined catalyst supported on MgO were too small to be detected by XRD or even electron diffraction but were clearly observed by laser-Raman spectroscopy (LRD). However, the magnesium molybdate particles supported on all of the magnesium alumina composite catalysts were large enough to be observed by XRD even on the freshly calcined, un-used catalyst as shown in Fig. 9. The band at 20 = 26 ,~, is characteristic of MgMoO4. Line broadening of the peak corresponded generally to particle sizes of 150-250 ,~,. XRD also shows the presence of MgO and either spinel or alumina. The spinel peaks are shifted only slightly from those of alumina. Thus, it is difficult to actually measure the amounts of alumina or spinel. Fig. 9 also shows the XRD of the same catalyst used for 262 h. There is very little change except that the MgMoO4 peak is larger, i.e., the particle size has grown. The BET surface area has remained the same. This is in contrast to the MgO supported catalysts which after use showed significant loss of surface area. For MgO supported catalysts the appearance of MgMoO4 particles large enough to be observed by XRD occurred only after significant use. Since the composites contain a MgO phase, it is not surprising that MgMoO4 would form; however, MgMoO4 also forms on the pure MgA1204 spinel which has at most trace amounts of MgO. This indicates that molybdenum can extract magnesium from the spinel to form MgMoO4. This difference in particle size on composites vs. magnesia is significant for activity. The active surface of MgMoO4 is much higher on the very small particles on magnesia but the particles grow to larger, more stable particles with use. Appar- ently, the spinel support does not stabilize the dispersed molybdate as well and larger, stable particles are formed even in the beginning. MgO and A1203 can react to form spinel at 600 provided there is intimate contact. In the case of co-precipitated salts to form a gel, only spinel forms after calcination. With the fairly large particles of MgO present during the formation of the composite, careful XRD does indicate the presence of spinel but primarily alumina. The addition of molybdenum catalyzes the formation of spinel. Therefore, the surface of the alumina phase is probably covered with a layer of spinel. This would explain the similarity of activity of magnesia alumina catalysts over a wide range of composition. The magnesia stabilized with 20% alumina very likely has a surface coating of spinel and therefore gives activity almost identical to that of the alumina rich catalyst (Table 4). Elemental X-ray maps showing the structure of the composite and the distribution of A1 and Mg in the composite support and Mo in the calcined catalyst are given in Fig. 10. The backscattered electrons (BSE in Fig. 10a) shows the heterogeneous structure of the support. The profiles for A1 and Mg (Fig. 10b and Fig. 10c) indicate 144 G.E. Vrieland et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 123-145 that particles rich in Mg are surrounded by a matrix containing alumina. When molybdenum is added to form the calcined catalyst (Fig. 11 ), the AI map retains its discrete structure (Fig. 1 lb) but the Mg and Mo (Fig. 1 lc and Fig. 1 ld) are more evenly distributed. With greater magnification by TEM the composite support shows two major phases (Fig. 12). The first consists of occlusions which are predominantly a porous MgO with trace amounts of AI ( < 0.2%). These are surrounded by a matrix which contains the aluminum and some magnesium (8% MgO by wavelength dispersion spectroscopy). When molybdenum is added Fig. 13, the occlusions are replaced by a void lined with crystals of MgMoO4. Both MgMoO4 and MgO are observed by electron diffraction within the matrix of alumina. A possible explanation is that when AHM is added to the composite support, the MgO occlusions partially dis- solve in the aqueous phase (since MgMoO4 is quite soluble, ca. 12 wt.-%) and redistributes on the alumina/spinel matrix phase to form a dispersion of MgO and MgMoO4. This is the dominant active phase. Any MgMoO4 which is not dispersed on the support forms large crystallites and these contribute only a small amount to the total activity. 4. Conclusions In the previous paper [ 1 ] the catalyst magnesium molybdate supported on MgO was shown to be an excellent catalyst for the butane to butadiene oxidation. How- ever, it had practical limitations such as poor attrition resistance and loss of activity with time due to loss of surface area of the support and of the active molybdate particles. The addition of alumina to this system preserves most of the desirable catalytic properties of the MgO supported catalyst while providing structural sta- bility. ( 1 ) Catalysts with alumina added to the magnesia support have been prepared in commercial scale spray drying equipment which have excellent attrition resis- tance adequate for use in transport bed reactors. An additional unexpected result is that the catalyst stability with time on stream is greater than that observed on magnesia. (2) The activities of magnesia-alumina either in the form of the pure spinel, spinel on magnesia alumina composites, or supported on alumina are very similar, indicative of a common spinel surface. The activities are less than those obtained on magnesia alone; however, acceptable conversions can be obtained at lower space velocities and the selectivities to butadiene and butenes are still high. (3) The effects of %MoO3 and %alkali are similar to those observed on MgO, namely, a broad maximum in activity with %MOO3 at around 15%-25% and selective poisoning of sites producing COx by the addition of alkali to give improved selectivity to C4's. The level of alkali metal is slightly higher than that needed for MgO reflecting the inherent higher acidity of the alumina containing system. G.E. Vrieland et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 123-145 145 (4) The composite support was observed to consist of occlusions of MgO in a matrix of alumina. After the addition of molybdenum the MgO occlusions shrink to a few large crystals of MgMoO4 while most the molybdenum is dispersed as particles of MgMoO4 with MgO on the spinel covered surface of the alumina matrix. These particles, although less active because of lower surface of the active molybdate, are more stable to further growth during catalyst use. (5) The addition of up to 2% V205 allows us to recover some of the lower activity and run at lower temperatures. With a corresponding higher addition of alkali high selectivity can be recovered and the coking of butadiene is reduced.
