Bhat, W.M.H. Sachtler * V.N. Ipatieff Center for Catalysis and Surface Science, Department of Chemist~, Northwestern University, Evanston, 1L 60208, USA Received 25 April 1996; revised 8 July 1996; accepted 8 July 1996 Abstract Zeolite Y supported rhodium catalysts were prepared by ion-exchange starting from an aqueous solution of [Rh[(NH3)sC1]C12 - 6H20]. Previous work in this laboratory had shown that this procedure results in a Rh dispersion of near 100%. The catalysts were tested for their activity in the CO2 reforming of CH4. They were found to combine extraordinary stability with high activity and selectivity. At 923 K, 90 mol-% of the CH4 was converted giving a H2/CO ratio near unity. A weight loading of 0.5 to 0.93% Rh gives the highest turnover frequencies. Thermody- namic equilibrium is reached near 873 K. With a given Rh loading, the zeolite supports are superior to amorphous supports and NaY is superior to the HY. No deactivation was observed in tests of 30 h time on stream at atmospheric pressure or after repeated thermal cycles. No coke deposition was detected by temperature programmed oxidation of used catalysts. Temperature programmed reduction indicates the presence of three discernible Rh species.

Introduction In recent years much research has been devoted to the chemical transforma- tions of methane [1], in particular its conversion into synthesis gas, or 'syngas'. Syngas is the starting material for the manufacture of liquid energy carriers by the Fischer-Tropsch process [2,3], and the production of base chemicals, such as methanol, by catalytic processes. Defining 'syngas' as any mixture of carbon * Corresponding author. Fax: (+ 1-847)491 5263; e-mail: wmhs@nwu.edu. 0926-860X/97/$17.00 Copyright © 1997 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Sachtler / Applied Catalysis A: General 150 (1997) 279-296 monoxide and hydrogen, three routes using methane as the starting material are of interest: (1) Steam reforming, leading, ideally, to H2/CO = 3: CH4 + H20 ~ CO + 3H2, An°98 = 206kJ/mol (1) (2) CO2 reforming, leading to H2/CO = 1: CH4 -t- CO2 ~ 2CO + 2H2, AH°98 = + 247 kJ/mol (2) (3) Partial oxidation, leading to H2/CO = 2: 1 CH4 + 702 ~ CO + 2H2, AH°98 = -38kJ/mol (3) Among these routes, steam reforming is by far the most mature and widely applied process. Supported nickel catalysts, e.g., Ni/A1203, are used for this purpose. If a H2/CO ratio > 3 is required, steam reforming can be combined with the water gas shift reaction: H20 + CO ~ CO2 ~ H2, AH°98 = -41.16kJ/mol (4) While it is not the purpose of this paper to dwell on the relative merits of the three routes, it is necessary to mention that nickel based catalysts require a high partial pressure of steam. When used for route (2), without steam in the feed, carbon deposits are formed which deactivate the catalysts, as reported by Rostrup-Nielsen and Bak Hansen [4]. The carbon deposits often appear in the form of fibrous 'whiskers', which tend to plug the reactor. Carbon formation on nickel is a consequence of the Boudouard reaction: 2CO ~ C + CO2, An°98 = - 172kJ/mol and/or methane cracking: cn4 ~- C -J- 2H2, AH°98 = 74.91 kJ/mol (5) (6) both reactions being catalyzed by nickel. This fact makes steam reforming and nickel based catalysts less attractive for applications where a H2/CO ratio < 3 is desired. For these applications CO2 reforming of methane producing a H2/CO ratio near 1/1 appears the preferred choice. It has been suggested that noble metal catalysts [5], e.g., rhodium or ruthenium, or even sulfur passivated nickel catalysts will not suffer from the carbon deposition problem typical for nickel in the absence of steam addition to the feed. CO2 reforming was studied as early as 1928 by Fischer and Tropsch [6], Solymosi et al. [7] and Erdoheyli et al. [8] showed that rhodium catalysts prepared by impregnation of RhC13-3H20 over SiO2, A1203 and TiO2 are active for methane decomposition and CO2 reforming of methane. More re- cently, Rostrup-Nielsen [9] compared catalysts based on nickel, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, iridium and platinum; they found that ruthenium and rhodium showed high selectivity for carbon-free operation. Tsipouriari et al. [10] found that the performance of Rh catalysts, under conditions of CO2 reforming R.N. Bhat, W.M.H. Sachtler / Applied Catalysis A: General 150 (1997) 279-296 281 of methane, strongly depends on the carrier employed to disperse the metal. The initial specific activity, the deactivation rate, and the carbon deposition were all found to depend on the support material. Also Zhang et al. [11] showed that activity of oxide supported Rh catalysts in the CO2 reforming of CH4 strongly depends on the support. They also demonstrated that catalyst deactivation is a function of both support and the metal particle size. Tomiainen et al. [12] studied direct oxidation of methane to syngas on alumina monolith-supported noble metal catalysts. They observed that rhodium does not display measurable deactivation. Choudhary et al. [13] reported the simultaneous use of CO2 and 02 in the conversion of CH4 into syngas over NiO-CaO catalysts and severe conditions e.g. GHSV = 48,000 cm3/g/h at a temperature of 1123 K. Efs- tathiou et al., using isotopic tracing, showed that the carbon containing species accumulated on the catalyst surface under steady state conditions originates from the CO2 molecules [14]. The present paper focuses on Rh supported on a zeolite. The structure and the chemistry of these catalysts has been studied extensively in this laboratory. The experimental procedure to obtain a homogeneous distribution of Rh inside zeolite granuli by ion exchange is described by Tomczak et al. [15]. For low Rh loadings, a very high and stable metal dispersion can be achieved, because the protons, formed upon reducing rhodium ions with H2, act as 'chemical anchors'. These very small Rh clusters have a strongly reduced propensity to chemisorb H2 at low temperatures [16]; they share this behavior with small Rh clusters in molecular beams [17] and with highly dispersed Pd in proton containing zeolites [18]. As a consequence, the size of the Rh clusters is not derived from conventional hydrogen chemisorption but from electron microscopy or EXAFS. The preparation procedure used in this work is the same as described by Tomczak et al. [15,16] and by McCarthy et al. [19]; it leads to a very high metal dispersion, exposing virtually every Rh atom to the gas phase. Therefore 100% dispersion has been assumed in the present work for calculating turnover frequencies. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation The NaY and NH4Y zeolite supports were prepared from LZ Y-52 (Si/A1 = 2.6, Linde Molecular Sieves, Lot No. 968087061020-S-8). Two successive exchanges with a 20 molar excess of NaNO3 at room temperature were used to generate NaY, whereas NH4Y, the precursor to HY (90% exchange), was prepared by three successive exchanges with a 10 molar aqueous solution of NH4NO3 at 353 K. For exchanging rhodium into the zeolite, a dilute solution of [Rh(NH3)sC1]C12 (= 0.002 M) was slowly added to a zeolite slurry (3 g/l, 353 282 R.N. Bhat, W.M.H. Sachtler /Applied Catalysis A: General 150 (1997) 279-296 K) over a period of 12 h. Subsequently, the slurry was stirred for an additional 60 h in order to achieve homogeneous distribution of Rh throughout the zeolite granuli, as explained in the previous article. This was followed by filtration and washing with deionized water and drying in an oven at 120°C. Weight loadings were in the range of 0.5 to 7.3 wt.-%. Rhodium catalysts on AI203, TiO2 and SiOz supports containing 1.0% or 5% Rh respectively were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation using RhC13 • 3H20. These catalysts were cal- cined from RT to 723 K over a period of 12 h in a flow of pure 02 (100 ml/min) and kept at this temperature for 4 h, followed by flushing with Ar. Some samples were subsequently reduced in flowing Hz at 723 K. The metal load of the samples was determined by ICP elemental analysis. 2.2. Catalytic tests The COz reforming reaction of CH4 was carried out in a continuous flow quartz microreactor at atmospheric pressure. Ultra-high purity reactants were used in all the experiments. Mass-flow controllers (Brooks) allow exact control of the volumes of CH4, CO2 and Ar flowing into the reactor. This system was used in conjunction with two GCs (Varian-3400 and HP-5980), having a TCD and FID detector, respectively. The reaction temperature was measured using a Cr-alumel thermocouple which was placed in the center of the catalyst bed. The reported reaction temperatures were measured at steady state reaction condi- tions. No temperature gradients were observed. A packed 12' silica gel column and a 50 m PONA capillary column were used for the total analysis of the reaction products, In a typical reforming reaction 200 mg of the catalyst was charged in the quartz microreactor. The catalyst was calcined from RT to 723 K at a rate of 1 K/rain, then maintained at 723 K for 4 h. This was followed by flushing the catalyst with Ar for half an hour before the reactants were admitted. The feed rate was in the range of 60-100 ml/min. The reactions were studied in the temperature range 723-1023 K. The catalysts have been tested under various pretreatment and steady state conditions. 2.3. Temperature programmed reduction / desorption (TPR / TPD) Used catalysts were cooled in helium to RT and transferred to the TPR system. In some cases they were first calcined under specified conditions. The temperature was measured in the center of the catalyst bed, using a Cr-alumel thermocouple. Linearity of the temperature programming was ensured by an electronic timer. Before starting a TPR program, the samples were cooled to 193 K and the flowing gas was switched to 5% H2/Ar (25 ml/min). The tempera- ture was then increased with a ramp of 8 K/min up to a holding temperature of 973 K, which was held for 30 min. The H2 consumption was monitored with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) connected to a PC data station. Following R.N. Bhat, W.M.H. Sachtler / Applied Catalysis A: General 150 (1997) 279-296 283 reduction, samples were cooled to room temperature in 5% H2/Ar. After 30 min they were purged in an Ar flow of 25 ml/min for 30 min. The system was then cooled to 193 K to start the temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of H2• 2.4. Temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) TPO experiments were conducted to detect and quantify carbonaceous de- posits over the used catalysts. The reactor containing the catalyst was transferred to the TPO apparatus without exposing the catalyst to air. The catalyst was then heated in the flow of 5% 02 in He, from room temperature to 1023 K, with a heating rate of 8 K/min. The evolved gases were monitored by on-line mass spectrometry. 2.5. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) A Hitachi HF-2000 high resolution analytical electron microscope equipped with a field emission cathode was used for rhodium particle size analysis. The microscope was operated at 200 keV in the bright field mode. The ex-situ treated catalysts were supported on carbon coated copper grids for the experi- ment. 3. Results 3.1. Catalysis A 17 wt.-% Ni/A1203, used in steam reforming, was tested for CO2 reforming of CH4 without adding steam to the feed. This catalyst gave high initial conversions but showed rapid deactivation. Carbon filaments (' whiskers') could easily be seen with the naked eye. This carbonaceous deposit led to a severe pressure drop in the reactor; in one test run this resulted in the destruction of the reactor. A zeolite supported cobalt catalyst likewise displayed rapid deactivation. In contrast, initial studies with zeolite supported Rh catalysts gave very encouraging results; research further focused on this class, in particular rhodium on zeolite NaY (Rh/NaY). 3.1.1. Effect of reaction temperature The catalytic activities were tested at temperatures ranging from 723-973 K with a constant feed composition of 20:20:60 ml/min of CH4:CO2:Ar, respec- tively. The results are shown in Fig. 1, where the solid line indicates theoretical thermodynamic equilibrium. The data show that equilibrium is reached near 850 K. As expected, the conversion of CH4 increases with temperature and so does 284 R.N. Bhat, W.M.H.

This reflects the interference of the water-gas shift reaction (WGSR). At lower temperature in the presence of CO and H2 the reverse WGSR is favored, leading to the formation of more CO. 3.1.2. Effect of feed composition Fig. 2 shows the effect of varying of the (CH4/CO2) ratio in the feed for the 3.2% Rh/NaY catalyst. The H2/CO product ratio shows little dependence and is near unity, indicating the absence of major side reactions. This is consistent with thermodynamic data [20]. 3.1.3. Effect of rhodium loading Rh/NaY catalysts with varying rhodium content, namely 0.5-7.3 wt.-% of rhodium over NaY, have been studied in the CO2 reforming of CH4.

For all these catalysts thermodynamic equilibrium is reached at around 873 K. Rhodium loading of 0.5 to 0.93 wt.-% in NaY was found to suffice for obtaining the desired high activity and selectivity. 3.1.4. Effect of supports In Table 1, data are compiled for rhodium catalysts on a variety of supports, viz. NaY, NaZSM-5, A1203, and SiO2. For each catalyst the CH4 conversion and the H z/CO ratio in the reaction product are given. With comparable weight loadings of rhodium, these catalysts differed in the H2/CO product ratio, which was near unity for NaY supported Rh, but substantially lower for Rh on Table 1 Effect of supports in the CO2 reforming of CH4 over supported rhodium catalysts Catalyst CH4 conversion (mol-%) H2//CO 0.1% Rh/NaY 10 0.75 0.5% Rh/NaY 20 0.78 0.93% Rh/NaY 30 0.92 1% Rh/NaZSM-5 28 0.89 1% Rh/NaZSM-5 (N) 34 0.93 1% Rh/AI203 23.4 0.42 1% Rh/A1203 * 21.7 0.38 1% Rh/SiO2 10 0.55 1% Rh//SiO2 * 21 0.61 5.0% CoO/NaZSM-5 15 0.76 5.0% CoNiO/NaZSM-5 25 0.845 a Prepared as per Ref.

There was also a pronounced difference in the catalyst stabilities under reaction conditions. The activity of rhodium on amorphous oxide supports decreased with time on stream, whereas the zeolite supported rhodium catalysts did not deactivate even at the longest times on stream. These results indicate an important advantage of the zeolite support. 3.1.5. Comparison between H-, Na-, and neutralized Rh / NaY catalysts It is known that for many catalytic reactions over zeolite supported metal catalysts, zeolite protons act as BrCnsted acid sites and as chemical anchors for the metal particles. Protons can be formed by thermal decomposition of NH~- ions and by chemical reduction of metal ions with H2. Therefore we compared Rh in three types of Y zeolites: (1) HY, where all charge compensation ions are protons; (2) NaY, where only the protons are present that are formed during the reduction of the Rh3÷ ions; and (3) neutralized catalysts where the protons formed during reduction were neutralized by treatment with NaOH, followed by a second reduction. It was found that the 7.3% Rh/NaY catalyst showed higher activity than the 7.3% Rh/HY catalyst in the CO2 reforming of CH4. A catalyst sample that was neutralized, followed by washing with double deionized water, gave a higher conversion and selectivity than non-neutralized catalysts as shown in Fig. 4. These results indicate that acidity has no positive effect in the COz reforming of CH4 over Rh/NaY catalysts. In view of the high reaction temperatures required for the catalysis of the endothermic reforming reaction, it is conceivable that the state of the rhodium, whether metallic or oxidic, will be defined by the interaction of Rh with the gases, i.e. equilibria such as: Rh203 + 3H2 ~ 2Rh° + 3H20 Rh203 d- 3CO ~ 2Rh° + 3CO2 R.N.

As it is not predictable precisely where these equilibria will be for the small clusters in the zeolite cages, a few catalytic tests were carried out with pre-reduced catalysts and those which were used after the ordinary calcination treatment without special reduction. It appeared that the prereduced catalysts exhibited a lower catalytic activity, as shown in Fig. 5. The unreduced catalysts retained their superior performance through numerous catalytic cycles. It was, therefore, decided to test further samples without prereduction. 3.1.6. Reaction kinetics Dependencies of reaction rates on the partial pressure of CH4 and COz were determined over a range of partial pressures for 3.2% Rh/NaY catalyst. The reaction orders for CH4 (a), and CO2 (b), were determined by fitting the data to a power rate law of the form: ri = kP~H4 P~oz (7) Experiments were done at a total pressure of 1 bar, keeping the partial pressure of one reactant constant and varying that of the other reactant, using argon to make up the difference. In Fig. 6 the In rate-vs-ln Px plots are shown for 3.2% Rh/NaY catalyst at 873 K. From these plots the following reaction orders are derived: a= 1.0 and b=0 3.2. Temperature programmed reduction / desorption Fig. 7 shows some of the TPR profiles of the 7.3% Rh/NaY catalyst that had been cooled in helium after the end of the catalytic run.

Whereas in profile B of Fig. 8, the TPR of H2 of the used catalyst cooled in feed stream without any treatment, then reoxidized to 573 K, 823 K and 923 K gave H/Rh ratios of 0.38, 0.83, 2.64 and 3.17, respectively. The profiles C and D in Fig. 8 indicate the presence of three different species of rhodium. The peak at 358 K is assigned to Rh203 the peak at 471 K is assigned to Rh3+ in sodalite cages. The peaks at 439.38 K in profile A (Fig. 7) and at 404 K in profile C and D (Fig. 8) are assigned to Rh3 ÷ in super cages. The peak at 247.6 K is an artifact, caused by the desorption of Ar. In Table 2 the H/M (M = Co, Ni, Rh... ) values are compiled. In the case of TPR these are an indication of the average valency of the Rh, in the case of TPD they present the apparent metal dispersion. 3.3. Catalyst deactivation As shown in Fig. 9A, the 7.3% Rh/NaY catalyst showed constant activity and selectivity during the entire duration of the 30 h long time on stream experiment. The Rh/NaY catalyst gave a H2/CO ratio near unity; no deactiva- tion was observed in any of these experiments. However, there was slight change in the color of the used catalyst from colorless to light brown. When the reaction was operated with increasing temperature followed by lowering the temperature, the ascending and descending branches gave the same catalytic performance at the same temperature. These 'thermal cycle' data are shown in Fig. 9B. They confirm the total absence of any observable catalyst deactivation. In these tests, the temperature was maintained for 1 h after reaching the upper value (923 K) and for 2 h at the lower value (723 K) before analyzing the effluent. Even after 20 thermal cycles the 0.93 wt.-% Rh/NaY catalyst did not show any appreciable deactivation. As coke deposition and particle agglomeration are common causes for the deactivation of supported metal catalysts, it was decided to separately probe for any carbonaceous deposits by temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) and for particle agglomeration by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It was found that no CO2 was detectable with TPO with samples that had been used as catalyst for several hours and were subsequently cooled in a helium flow. The absence of a signal is considered significant; for samples of the same composi- tion, 7.3% Rh/NaY, that were cooled in the feed gas TPO did reveal formation of some CO2 and CO. This TPO profile is shown in Fig. 9C. The temperature at which these gases appear is below 473 K indicating that adsorbed CO was desorbed and physisorbed methane oxidized. To confirm this hypothesis, an experiment was carried out by cooling a catalyst sample in the feed and subsequently flushing it with pure Ar at 393 K for 30 rain. As shown in Fig. 9D, the TPO of this sample did not show CO2 formation, but a small quantity of CO was detected. This indicates that when the catalyst is cooled in the feed stream, rhodium carbonyl complexes are formed, either CO adsorbed on Rh particles or t°°i _~ (a)( t -~ L E 60+ '°t 0 0.60 0.4 0.2 ,I ....

Recently, Efstathiou et al. [14] also reported similar observations over oxide supported Rh catalysts. Fig. 10 shows TEM micrographs of 7.3% Rh/NaY samples after use and cooling in the feed stream. It clearly shows the presence of rhodium particles of approximately 40/~. Their formation inside the zeolite must have led to some local destruction of the zeolite framework; it further remained intact, as can be seen from the clearly visible fringes. The XRD powder pattern confirmed the structural integrity of the zeolite; it also revealed the presence of metallic rhodium; broad lines are consistent with small particles of the size indicated by B Fig. 10.

This is in agreement with our earlier results that fresh Rh/NaY catalysts have a metal dispersion near 100% [15]. The high thermostability of the catalysts indicates that the 40 A Rh particles are formed in the initial stage of the catalytic operation; once they are formed no further agglomeration takes place. For comparison, a TEM micrograph of a Rh/SiO2 that was used as a catalyst is included in Fig. 10. Note the difference in magnification of the two micro- graphs. Clearly the Rh particles are larger in the Rh/SiO2 sample than in Rh/NaY. 3.4. Comparison of rhodium catalysts prepared by ion exchange or impregna- tion In addition to the support effect, Table 1 also gives a comparison between ion-exchanged and impregnated rhodium catalysts in CO2 reforming of CH4. With different weight loadings of rhodium in the ion-exchanged catalysts the H2/CO ratio was nearly unity, whereas in the impregnated catalysts this ratio is always less than one. Likewise, in the work by Erdtihelyi et al. [8], with catalysts prepared by impregnation, a H2/CO ratio near 0.36 was reported for the lower temperatures. The activity for CO2 reforming of CH4 of the impreg- nated samples l%Rh/SiO2 and 1% Rh/A1203 is high. 4. Discussion The results show that CO2 reforming of methane is efficiently catalyzed by zeolite supported rhodium catalysts. A high conversion (95 mole %) is easily achieved between 873-973 K. The two reactants apparently facilitate each other's dissociation, as reported previously by Erdtihelyi et al. [8]. Zeolite supported Rh, prepared by ion exchange, appears to differ from other supported Rh catalysts in two respects: (1) the H2/CO ratio in the product is significantly higher (ca. 1.0) than for rhodium on amorphous supports prepared by impregna- tion, (2) the zeolite supported rhodium catalysts are remarkably stable. Higher H z/CO ratios can easily be achieved by adding steam to the feed. This provides high flexibility of operation under varying feed composition. The order of the reaction with respect to CH4 was found to be 0.94 _+ 0.06; for CO2 it is ca. 0. The former values are in good agreement with that reported by Rostrup-Nielsen and Hansen [9]. For feeds containing much less CO2 these authors report a reaction order near unity for CO2. The absence of any appreciable deactivation during 30 h of time on stream and after multiple thermal cycles is remarkable and of importance for industrial application. Though some of the characterization data were obtained with 294 R.N. Bhat, W.M.H. Sachtler /Applied Catalysis A: General 150 (1997) 279-296 samples of higher Rh content, the catalytic data show that catalysts with rhodium contents as low as 0.5-0.93 wt.-% did not deactivate either. In contrast, rhodium supported on amorphous oxides deactivated significantly under the same conditions of reaction. One cause of the extraordinary stability of zeolite supported rhodium is the absence of coke formation. As mentioned, no carbonaceous material could be detected with the TPO. The high sensitivity of this method is manifest from its detection of adsorbed molecules in the samples that had been cooled in the feed stream. The second cause for the unusual stability is the lack of metal agglomeration beyond the stage of 40 .~ Rh particles. We can only speculate about the causes for this. An obvious possibility is that the zeolite framework efficiently sup- presses any particle mobility, after the initial agglomeration has created the voids which accommodate the 40 ,~ particles. It is easy to imagine that metal particles can slide more easily over the surface of an amorphous support than move through a three-dimensional framework with holes that are much smaller than the size of the particle. Supported metal particles do, however, not only grow by migration and coalescence. The classical process of Ostwald ripening assumes that smaller entities, e.g., individual atoms, shuttle between particles; in this process the larger particles exposing stable crystal faces grow at the expense of smaller particles. It is not very likely that Rh atoms could easily leave Rh clusters, as the heat of sublimation of Rh is very high. A more likely candidate for a shuttling process would be the ion Rh(CO)~-, which is easily formed when Rh particles interact with CO molecules and an appropriate electron acceptor. In the previous work it was shown that with protons as electron acceptors, the reaction: 1 2Rhn + 2CO + H+ ~ Rhn_1 -q- Rh(CO); --~ ~-H2 (8) occurs readily with zeolite supported Rh [21]. The observations: (1) that the apparent valency of the Rh in used catalysts is > 0 and (2) that some CO is desorbed from samples that were cooled in the feed, could imply that dicarbonyl cations might exist, either during the catalysis or during the period when catalysts were cooled in the feed stream. However, even if some exchange of matter occurs between Rh particles during the steady state, there is no driving force for Ostwald ripening when all Rh particles have the same Gibbs free energy, i.e. the same size and shape, as appears to be the case from the TEM results. Moreover, any growth of particles beyond the size which is apparently attained rather rapidly would require drastic destruction of the encaging zeolite framework and thus have a high activation energy. It is interesting that Rh/HY is inferior to Rh/NaY as a catalyst for CO2 reforming of methane. The reaction orders suggest that dissociative adsorption of methane on Rh particles is a difficult step in this reaction. It is known that in the presence of protons metal-proton adducts are formed in zeolite cavities [22]. R.N. Bhat, W.M.H. Sachtler / Applied Catalysis A: General 150 (1997) 279-296 295 For Pt and Pd it was shown that dissociative chemisorption of H2 is inhibited on metal-proton adducts [18], it is therefore conceivable that a similar effect is valid for the dissociative adsorption of methane. Another possibility is partial destruction of the zeolite framework by the combined action of steam, formed by the WGS reaction, and protons acting as acid sites. These questions have been left open, as the work described in this paper mainly focused on the more active Rh/NaY catalysts. 5. Conclusions Zeolite supported rhodium particles, encaged in zeolite NaY, prepared by ion-exchange of [Rh(NH3)sC1]C12, effectively catalyze the conversion of CO2 + CH4 to CO -b H2 even with very low metal loadings. The Rh/NaY catalysts are very active and produce syngas with a H2/CO ratio near unity from equimolar CO2 + CH4 feeds. Higher H2/CO ratios are obtained from feeds containing steam in addition to CO2 and CH4. Most remarkable is the unique stability of these catalysts under operating conditions of high temperature and atmospheric pressure. One cause of this unique stability is the total absence of carbonaceous deposits that has been verified by temperature programmed oxida- tion of used catalysts. TEM micrographs show that the Rh particles are quite uniform, having a size of -\" 40 A. Apparently, this particle size is attained in the early stages of the catalysis and the zeolite framework protects the encaged particles against further growth. Therefore catalyst deactivation is not observed under conditions where it is significant for Rh on amorphous supports. Rh/HY is also stable, but less active than Rh/NaY. In contrast, nickel and cobalt catalysts have very poor stability; they deactivate rapidly in the absence of steam in the feed because of extensive formation of carbon whiskers.
