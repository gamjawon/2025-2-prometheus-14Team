Box 513, 5600 MB Eindhoven, The Netherlands Received 7 April 1997: received in revised form 14 June 1997\" accepted 15 July 1997 Abstract A study of the intrinsic kinetics of the oxidation of formic acid over a 1% Pt/C catalyst has been performed, at oxygen concentrations in water varying from 0.6 to 2.8 molm-3 and at formic acid concentrations varying from 30 to 400 molm-3 Experiments were performed in a continuous-flow stirred slurry reactor. To avoid mass transfer limitation of oxygen, a temperature interval from 282 to 293 K and a total pressure in the reactor of 0.6 MPa has been used. The pH interval of the experiments ranged from 1.1 to 13.0. Single response non-linear regression has been used to fit the parameters for a kinetic model. The proposed model can predict the steady-state disappearance rate of formic acid, as a function of the oxygen concentration, the formic acid concentration, the temperature and of the pH. Electrochemical experiments have been carried out for a better understanding of the pH effect on the formic acid oxidation, c:{~ 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

A study of the intrinsic kinetics of the oxidation of formic acid over a 1% Pt/C catalyst has been performed, at oxygen concentrations in water varying from 0.6 to 2.8 mol m−3 and at formic acid concentrations varying from 30 to 400 mol m−3. Experiments were performed in a continuous-flow stirred slurry reactor. To avoid mass transfer limitation of oxygen, a temperature interval from 282 to 293 K and a total pressure in the reactor of 0.6 MPa has been used. The pH interval of the experiments ranged from 1.1 to 13.0. Single response non-linear regression has been used to fit the parameters for a kinetic model. The proposed model can predict the steady-state disappearance rate of formic acid, as a function of the oxygen concentration, the formic acid concentration, the temperature and of the pH. Electrochemical experiments have been carried out for a better understanding of the pH effect on the formic acid oxidation.
