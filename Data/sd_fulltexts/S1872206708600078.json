RESEARCH PAPER Deactivation of CeO 2 -Promoted Co/SiO 2 Fischer–Tropsch Catalysts DAI Xiaoping, YU Changchun*, LI Ranjia The Key Laboratory of Catalysis CNPC, University of Petroleum, Beijing 102249, China Abstract: The catalytic performance of the CeO 2 -Co/SiO 2 catalyst was investigated for Fischer–Tropsch synthesis on a lab-scale fixed-bed reactor filled with 1.5 L catalyst (1–3 mm) for 300 h under the reaction conditions of 1.5 MPa, 488 K, and 400 h –1 . The catalyst was char- acterized by temperature-programmed reduction, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The catalyst exhibited a CO conversion of 41%, a C 5+ selectivity of 85%, and a CH 4 selectivity of 10%. XRD results revealed the presence of CoO and cobalt silicate species on the catalyst that was located near the outlet of the reactor after reaction. It was proposed that the cobalt silicate species was formed through reaction 2Co + SiO 2 + 2H 2 O : Co 2 SiO 4 + 2H 2 via a CoO intermediate, which was kinetically restricted under typical Fischer–Tropsch synthesis conditions. Key words: ceria; cobalt; silica; supported catalyst; Fischer–Tropsch synthesis; catalyst deactivation Fischer–Tropsch (FT) synthesis has attracted more and more attention for the conversion of natural gas via syngas to ul- traclean transportation fuels that are free of S, N, metals, and aromatic hydrocarbons. The major driving force to develop the gas-to-liquid (GTL) technology is the high price of crude oil and the growing demand for clean diesel fuels in the world. During the last few decades, Sasol, BP, Shell, Exxon, and many other companies have invested time and resources in the de- velopment of the GTL technology primarily using the FT synthesis process. The economy of the FT process is critically dependent on the effectiveness of the catalysts, which should have high activity and selectivity for heavy products in the FT synthesis at low temperature but low activity in the water–gas shift reaction. The current emphasis has shifted toward maximizing the yield of high cetane number C 10 –C 20 and C 20+ products from FT synthesis. The increasing worldwide demand for low-sulfur diesel has further stressed the importance of developing zero-sulfur FT fuels [1]. Among the catalysts for FT synthesis, cobalt catalysts are the most active, selective, stable, and fa- vorable for the production of long-chain paraffins with high selectivity [2]. Various promoters for obtaining higher activity and C 5+ yields have been investigated, including metal pro- moters such as Ru [3], Pt [4,5], and Re [6,7], and oxide pro- moters such as La 2 O 3 [8,9], ZrO 2 [10,11], and CeO 2 [12–15]. However, cobalt catalysts used in the FT synthesis are rela- tively expensive compared to iron and need to have a high metal dispersion and long life to remain economically attrac- tive. The development of economically attractive cobalt-based FT synthesis catalysts with high stability requires detailed fundamental understanding of their deactivation mechanism. The oxidation of cobalt metal by water is generally considered the major reason for the deactivation of cobalt catalysts during FT synthesis [16–22], but these studies do not indicate how Co 0 can form a cobalt silicate. Other authors [23–26] argued that bulk metallic cobalt cannot be oxidized to CoO or Co 3 O 4 under real FT synthesis conditions. However, these studies were carried out under a simulated reaction condition by introducing water, and this might lead to an unreasonable explanation for the catalyst deactivation. Recently, we reported a CeO 2 -promoted Co/SiO 2 catalyst, which has merits of high activity (CO conversion > 85%), low formation of CH 4 , high C 5+ selectivity (~80%), and high sta- bility [15], but the tests were performed in a fixed-bed micro- reactor with 2 ml catalyst (20–40 mesh). Therefore, it is of great importance to scale up the preparation and catalytic tests of the CeO 2 -Co/SiO 2 catalyst in a lab-scale fixed-bed reactor, which will be favorable for the industrial application of the DAI Xiaoping et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2007, 28(12): 1047–1052 catalyst. In this study, the stability and deactivation of the CeO 2 -Co/SiO 2 catalyst have been investigated in a lab-scale fixed-bed reactor, and the catalysts were characterized by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The reasons for the catalyst deactivation in FT synthesis are dis- cussed. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation The CeO 2 -Co/SiO 2 catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of calculated amounts of Co(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O and Ce(NO 3 ) 3 ·6H 2 O (industrial products, Shandong Zibo Zhaoyi Chemical Co., China) over 1.5 kg SiO 2 (Qingdao Haiyang Chemical Co., China, A BET = 175.5 m 2 /g, 3 = 1–3 mm). The Co loading was 15 wt%, and the Ce/Co molar ratio was 0.28. The samples were dried in air at 353 K for 24 h and calcined at 723 K for 10 h. 1.2 Catalyst characterization TPR with H 2 was performed in a fixed-bed quartz microre- actor (i.d. 8 mm) packed with 0.3 g of catalyst samples. The temperature was raised from room temperature to 1100 K at a rate of 10 K/min in 20% H 2 –80% Ar at 30 ml/min. The analysis of the reactants and products was carried out using an online mass spectrometer (Ametek Dycor system 1000). Crystal phase analysis was performed by XRD on a Shi- madzu XRD-6000 diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu K . ra- diation operated at 40 kV and 35 mA. The XRD patterns were recorded from 2 = 10º to 70º at a rate of 4º/min. XPS measurements were conducted on a VG MKII system. The C 1s line with the binding energy (BE) of 284.6 eV from carbon contaminations was used as the reference. 1.3 Stability tests of the catalysts Stability tests of the catalysts were carried out in a fixed-bed reactor (i.d. 33 mm u 2200 mm) packed with 1.5 L catalyst. The reactor was heated with heat transfer oil by circulation. The catalyst was activated at 723 K under atmosphere pressure in 10% H 2 –90% N 2 at 1 L/min for 24 h and then cooled to room temperature in a flow of H 2 . The reaction conditions were T = 488 K (heat transfer oil temperature), p = 1.5 MPa, and GHSV = 400 h 1 . A synthesis gas of H 2 :CO = 2/1 (molar ratio) with 3% (v/v) nitrogen was used for the evaluation of the catalyst activity. Nitrogen was used as an internal standard to calculate the CO conversion and product selectivity. The synthesis gas was prepared by methanol decomposition, and it was then purified by cooling, desulfurization, and deoxidation. After that, the ratio of H 2 :CO was adjusted. The product analysis method and the equipment flow diagram were described in the literature [27]. The products were collected with a hot trap and a cold trap in sequence. The tail gas was analyzed by an HP 5890 gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a C sieve column (thermal conductivity detector, TCD) and a Porapak-Q column (flame ionization detector, FID). The liquid products were analyzed by an Agilent 1790 GC equipped with an HP-101 capillary col- umn and an FID. 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR spectra of the liquid hydrocarbons were recorded in CDCl 3 solvent on a JEOL JNM-LA 300 FT-NMR spectrometer under 75.5 MHz using tetramethylsi- lane (TMS) as an internal reference. 2 Results and Discussion 2.1 TPR and XPS Fig. 1 shows the TPR profiles of the catalysts. The fresh CeO 2 -Co/SiO 2 catalyst exhibited two reduction peaks at tem- peratures lower than 845 K, which were typically assigned to the reduction of Co 3 O 4 to CoO followed by the reduction of CoO to metallic Co [28]. However, the area ratio of the two peaks was away from the theoretical ratio of 3.0. This indicates that the reduction of CeO 2 , CeO 2 + H 2 : CeO 2–x + H 2 O [14], was involved in the reaction. In addition, the reduction tem- perature of CeO 2 over Co/SiO 2 was lower than that of pure CeO 2 . Similar results were observed by Barrault et al. [29] and Trovarelli et al. [30] in the presence of Ni and Rh. A third reduction peak appeared near 980 K, which corresponds to the reduction of cobalt silicate Co 2 SiO 4 [31]. Since the catalysts were reduced at 723 K before use, the cobalt species present in the 980 K reduction step was most likely not active for the FT synthesis. Typically, Ce 3d XPS core level spectra show three lobed envelopes at 879–890, 895–910, and approximately 916 eV as shown in Fig. 2. Following the labeling first used by Burroughs Fig. 1 TPR profiles of CeO 2 -Co/SiO 2 catalysts (1) and pure CeO 2 (2) DAI Xiaoping et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2007, 28(12): 1047–1052 et al. [32], the peaks labeled V were attributed to Ce 3d 5/2 , and those labeled U were attributed to Ce 3d 3/2 . The bands V, V\", and V''' were attributed to Ce 4+ . The reduction of CeO 2 would therefore result in a decrease of V''' and U''' peaks. This is consistent with our results. Rodríguez-Ramos et al. [33] and Ernst et al. [14] obtained similar results, where CeO 2 is par- tially reduced to CeO 2 �x and forms new bi-nuclear active sites together with Co 0 to improve the catalytic performance. 2.2 The catalyst stability Fig. 3 shows the conversion and selectivity of the CeO 2 -Co/SiO 2 catalyst as a function of time on stream. At the beginning, an activation process was observed over the catalyst, and the CO conversion was stabilized after 30 h, while the selectivity for C 5+ hydrocarbons declined to 85%. The product distribution over the CeO 2 -Co/SiO 2 catalyst was 10.1% CH 4 , 1.1% CO 2 , and 85.0% C 5+ . The selectivity for C 10+ hydrocar- bons was about 88% in liquid hydrocarbons (C 5+ ). H 2 O was the main byproduct, and CO 2 was the minor one. As time on stream increased, the CO conversion declined slightly, while the C 5+ selectivity remained at the level of 85%, which was relevant with the oxidation of metallic cobalt. The 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR spectra of liquid hydrocarbons are shown in Fig. 4. For the 1 H NMR spectrum, the peak at / = 0.9 was assigned to the protons of the terminal methyl group that was adjacent to the carbon atoms in the main chain back- bone. The peak at / = 1.3 was attributed to the protons of –CH 2 – in the main chain. For the 13 C NMR spectrum, the peak at / = 14 was mainly due to the carbon resonance for the ter- minal CH 3 group in the main chain. The peaks at / = 23, 29, and 32 were associated with the internal methylene carbon in the main chain of liquid hydrocarbons [34]. These results indicated that there were no detectable alkenes, aromatics, and oxygen- ates in the products. Such products were of particular value as diesel and jet fuels.

The fresh catalyst clearly exhibited two crystalline structures, Co 3 O 4 (JCPDS Card No. 43-1003) and CeO 2 (JCPDS Card No. 43-1002). Co 2 SiO 4 (cobalt silicate) was not detected over this catalyst. It is generally known that Co crys- tallites are the active sites for the FT synthesis. The dominant Fig. 2 Ce 3d XPS spectra of fresh CeO 2 -Co/SiO 2 (1) and 723 K reduced CeO 2 -Co/SiO 2 (2) Fig. 3 The stability test of CeO 2 -Co/SiO 2 catalyst in FT synthesis in a lab-scale fixed-bed reactor (Reaction conditions: 488 K, 400 h –1 , 1.5 MPa.) DAI Xiaoping et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2007, 28(12): 1047–1052 phase in the reduced catalyst was metallic Co 0 (41.6º, 44.3º, and 47.4º, JCPDS Card No. 89-4308). A small amount of CoO (36.6º and 42.6º, JCPDS Card No. 75-0533) and Co 2 SiO 4 (36.6º and 42.6º, JCPDS Card No. 75-0533) were detected over the post-reaction CeO 2 -Co/SiO 2 catalyst near the outlet of the reactor, but the main phases over the post-reaction catalyst were still Co 0 and CeO 2 . Although the diffraction peaks of Co 0 decreased, CoO and Co 2 SiO 4 were not detected over the post-reaction catalyst at the inlet of the reactor. Only a differ- ence between the post-reaction catalysts at the inlet and at the outlet was the composition of the reaction gases. The water partial pressure at the outlet was higher than that at the inlet, and the formation of CoO and Co 2 SiO 4 was relevant to the water partial pressure.

The concentration of water vapor increases along the length of a tubular reactor, and the formation of cobalt silicate is most favored at the downstream end of the tubular reactor [35]. The oxidation of surface cobalt atoms during FT synthesis has been observed by many researchers [16–19]. Chen et al. [20] proposed that the cobalt silicate species in the Co/ZrO 2 /SiO 2 catalyst might be responsible for the irreversible deactivation of the catalyst. The solid state reaction between CoO and SiO 2 requires a reaction temperature of 1173 K [36], but the reaction temperature of FT synthesis is in the range 453–523 K. Hence, the concentration of water vapor, which is relevant to silicic acid, plays a vital role in the formation of cobalt silicate [35]. Typical reaction conditions for FT synthesis were as follows (assuming a gradientless reactor): pressure of 1.5 MPa, tem- perature of 453–513 K, synthesis gas composition of 67% H 2 and 33% CO, and CO conversion of 36%–46%. These condi- tions resulted in a hydrogen partial pressure between 0.54 and 0.64 MPa and a water partial pressure between 0.18 and 0.23 MPa. Thus, a p(H 2 )/p(H 2 O) ratio was in the range 2.78–3.0. Accordingly, the changes of Gibbs energy for typical FT syn- thesis are shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 Gibbs energy changes for the catalyst deactivation reactions under FT reaction conditions (Conditions: total pressure 1.5 MPa, reaction temperature 453–513 K, synthesis gas composition 67% H 2 and 33% CO, CO conversion 36%–46%.) It can be seen in Fig. 6 that the oxidation of bulk phase me- tallic cobalt to CoO under typical FT synthesis conditions was unlikely from a purely thermodynamic point of view [21], and the oxidation of metallic cobalt became more impossible with increasing reaction temperature. However, many researchers reported the existence of cobalt catalyst oxidation during FT synthesis [6,16–22,37–39]. Kogelbauer et al. [16] found the formation of cobalt silicates upon exposure of the catalyst to H 2 O/Ar and H 2 O/H 2 /Ar (5%–10% H 2 O) and suggested that the formation of silicates leads to the oxidation of metallic cobalt. Huffmann et al. [25] observed the oxidation of Co/SiO 2 when CO/H 2 /H 2 O was introduced during the reaction. Li et al. [19] found that partial oxidation of metallic cobalt occurs during a long time exposure of the catalyst to water vapor at high partial pressure, and the cobalt metal with small crystallite size ap- pears to be more easily oxidized by water vapor to form cobalt oxide and leads to the catalyst deactivation. This deactivation is most likely caused by the oxidation of surface cobalt [22]. It can also be seen from Fig. 6 that the consecutive reaction, 2CoO + OSi(OH) 2 o Co 2 SiO 4 + H 2 O, is spontaneous and kinetically favored because its � G m is smaller than 0, and the conversion of 2Co + SiO 2 + 2H 2 O to Co 2 SiO 4 + 2H 2 is also spontaneous. Furthermore, the oxidation of Co to Co 2 SiO 4 DAI Xiaoping et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2007, 28(12): 1047–1052 should be considered to be kinetically restricted under typical FT synthesis conditions. The extent of oxidation depends on the water partial pressure and the ratio of p(H 2 O) to p(H 2 ) [40]. Because the surface Gibbs energy of nano-sized cobalt crys- tallites was lower than that of bulk cobalt crystallites, the sta- bility of small metallic cobalt crystallites may differ from bulk metallic cobalt. The oxidation of nano-sized cobalt to CoO depends on the crystallite size, morphology, the starting crystal phase, and the ratio of p(H 2 O) to p(H 2 ) [41]. Hence, smaller cobalt crystallites would have a higher propensity to be oxi- dized than larger ones. This is in agreement with the results of Iglesia [42], who found that small Co metal crystallites appear to be oxidized and rapidly deactivated in the presence of water under typical FT synthesis conditions. It is clear from the XRD measurements and literature results that the formation of CoO and Co 2 SiO 4 over the post-reaction catalyst at the reactor outlet was possibly due to the nano-sized cobalt and high water partial pressure. Therefore, it can be deduced that the conversion of metallic Co and silicic acid to Co 2 SiO 4 spinel proceeds via CoO species, where silicic acid is from the hydration of SiO 2 . Consequently, the observed deac- tivation is partially caused by the formation of the thermody- namically stable Co 2 SiO 4 spinel from the oxidation of highly dispersed Co particles [18]. 3 Conclusions The two reduction steps from Co 3 O 4 to CoO and CoO to metallic Co with partial reduction of CeO 2 were observed over the fresh CeO 2 -Co/SiO 2 catalyst. During the 300 h test of the CeO 2 -Co/SiO 2 catalyst in a lab-scale fixed-bed reactor, the conversion of CO was 41%, and the selectivity for liquid hy- drocarbons was 85%. The products were mainly straight-chain hydrocarbons, which are particularly valuable as diesel and jet fuels. The presence of water vapor led to the formation of thermodynamically stable Co 2 SiO 4 spinel from hydrated sili- con dioxide and CoO intermediate.

RESEARCH PAPER Deactivation of CeO2-Promoted Co/SiO2 Fischer-Tropsch Catalysts DAI Xiaoping YU Changchun * LI Ranjia The Key Laboratory of Catalysis CNPC, University of Petroleum, Beijing 102249, China * Corresponding author. Tel: +86-10-89707447; Fax: +86-10-89734979 The catalytic performance of the CeO2-Co/SiO2 catalyst was investigated for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis on a lab-scale fixed-bed reactor filled with 1.5 L catalyst (1–3 mm) for 300 h under the reaction conditions of 1.5 MPa, 488 K, and 400 h−1. The catalyst was characterized by temperature-programmed reduction, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The catalyst exhibited a CO conversion of 41%, a C5+ selectivity of 85%, and a CH4 selectivity of 10%. XRD results revealed the presence of CoO and cobalt silicate species on the catalyst that was located near the outlet of the reactor after reaction. It was proposed that the cobalt silicate species was formed through reaction 2Co + SiO2 + 2H2O→Co2SiO4 + 2H2 via a CoO intermediate, which was kinetically restricted under typical Fischer-Tropsch synthesis conditions.
