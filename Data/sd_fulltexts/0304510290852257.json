These catalysts displayed high activity for the Heck reaction ofiodobenzene with olefins. By using (P) 3-aminopyridine-palladium, a turnover number exceeding 16700 was observed for the reaction of iodobenzene with styrene or acrylamide. This catalyst can be recovered and reused by using tributylamine as base. It can also tolerate the presence of a variety of functional groups. Introduction We have been interested in the Heck reaction [1] catalyzed by polymer-bound palladium catalysts, especially in view of our observation that (P) byp-Pd I [2] is a more efficient catalyst than the polymeric phos- phinated palladium complex (P) PPh2 Pd PPh3 II [3]. However, the reduction of catalytic activity was serious during the reaction as a result of palladium leaching from the polymer support. Recently, we have reported a new polymer-bound palladium catalyst (P) Ph phen-Pd (reduced) HI [4] (Scheme 1), and a preliminary study of its catalytic properties for Heck olifination. Catalyst III showed high activity and can be recovered and reused by using tributylamine as base. However, extensive lose of catalytic activity was observed after several cycles due to the palladium leaching from the polymer support. More recently, we found that the palladium leaching from the polymer support is mainly caused by competitive complexing with ligands in the reaction media [5]. When sodium acetate and DMF, which is a poor ligand, were used in place of tributylamine. III showed high catalytic activity. After ten consecutive runs it still had higher activity. We also observed that some catalyst beads recovered were pulverized. In previous experiments, polystyrene resin with 2% divinylbenzene was used as the polymer support. The principal disadvantage of polymers is their lack of stability, both thermal and chemical, especially in reactions requiring higher *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/90/$3.50 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 298 O-^^-bpy.

Macroporous styrene-divinyl- benzene polymers are particularly notorious in this respect [6]. The in- stability of the polymer support might be another reason for palladium leaching from polymer support. The major advantages of inorganic supports over their organic counterparts are their better mechanical and thermal stabilities coupled with reasonable heat transfer properties. Thus, it is desirable to use inorganic species as the support. With this objective, we have designed several silica-supported palladium catalysts. In this paper we describe their syntheses and application to Heck olefination. Experimental Melting points were determined on a Yanoco micromelting point apparatus and are uncorrected. Infrared spectra were obtained on a Nicolet FT-IR 170 SX spectrometer, with samples run as KBr pellets. ^NMR spectra were obtained on a Varian FT-80 nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer using TMS as external standard. Elemental analyses were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 240 elemental analysis instrument. ESCA spectra were obtained on an Escalab spectrometer. HPLC were performed on a Varian SY-5060 chromatography system. Catalyst preparation Silica-supported PBI-Pd (IV) Polybenzimidazole (PBI) was prepared by a literature method [7] using an equimolar mixture of p-, and m-phthalic acid. To a solution of PBI (0.5 g) in DMF (30 ml), silica gel (5 g, 60-80 mesh, 406.2 m2 g~1) was added. The solvent was flash evaporated. Methanol (30 ml) was added into the residue, the @ PBI was separated by filtration, washed with methanoi and dried in a vacuum oven. The preparation of ( 1) PBI-PdClg complex and its reduction (Scheme 2) followed the procedure described for its PBI-supported analogue [7]. The color of catalyst IV was black. Elemental analysis found 0.16% Pd. Amirw-functionalized silica-supported palladium catalysts (V, VI, VII) Silica gel (60-80 mesh, 406.2 m2g~1) was predried under vaccum. A mixture of silica gel (15g), chloromethyltriethoxylsilane (13g) and 299 ;OOH ^(S^PB. ^(s^PB,-PdC,,-^(s^PB,.P<o) IV Scheme 2. anhydrous benzene (80ml) was refluxed with occasional stirring for 15 h. After cooling, the silica gel was separated by nitration, extracted with benzene for 8 h using a Soxhiet apparatus, washed with ethyl acetate (3 x 20 ml) and dried under vacuum. The chloromethylated silica gel (4.0 g) was refluxed with 2-aminopyridine (0.7 g) in THF (50ml) for 10 h. The resulting silica gel was collected, washed successively with 10% NagCOs, HgO, dilute acetic acid, ethyl acetate, acetone and ethanol, and dried under vacuum. Palladium acetate was coordinated to aminofunctionalized silica gel, followed by reduction, to give catalyst VI (Scheme 3) according to the procedure described in previous papers [2,4]. Elemental analysis found 1.24% Pd. The same procedure as described above was followed for the syntheses of polymeric catalysts V and VII (Scheme 3); elemental analyses found the palladium contents to be 0.66% and 1.27%, respectively. General procedure for Heck reaction A mixture of halide (lOmmol), olefin (llmmol), tributylamine (llmmol), DMF (2ml) and a given amount of catalyst was stirred under argon at the appropriate temperature. After the desired reaction time, the silica-supported catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture by filtra- tion, washed several times with DMF and re-used in the next run. The filtrate was poured into water, the precipitate formed was collected, washed with water and dried. The crude product was recrystallized to give the pure Si^OH Md^(s>-CH,C, J^^-CH^HR M^ (si)-CH,NHR Pd(OAc); LiAIH4 (s<)-CH,NHR Pd(o) Scheme 3. 300 Fig. 1.

All compounds had IR and ^NMR spectra consistent with their structures (Table 6) and gave satisfactory C, H and N analyses ( 3% of the calculated values). The comparison of catalytic activity between catalyst VII and Pd(OAc)z A mixture of iodobenzene (10 mmol), styrene (11 mmol), tributylamine (11 mmol), DMF (3ml) and a given amount of catalyst was stirred at the indicated temperature (Fig. 1). Aliquots were taken periodically and analyzed by HPLC (85% methanol/water; 0.4 ml min\"1) with biphenyl as internal standard, and with UV detection at 265 nm (Fig. 1). Results and discussion Silica gel is more robust mechanically and more stable thermally than polystyrene. At first, we have used silica gel as support and covered with PBI, which has good thermally stability. The resulting silica beads were then treated with PdClg, and reduced by Hg/PhNOg [8] to provide a silica- supported PBI Pd(0) catalyst IV (Scheme 2). Preliminary tests of catalyst IV m the reactions of iodobenzene with styrene or acrylamide showed that its 301 catalytic activity was lower than that of catalyst III or Pd(OAc)z. The results are summarized in Table 1. Attempts were made to increase the yield by increasing the amount of catalyst used, however no significant change was observed, probably due to the relatively weak coordinate ability of the monodentate ligand PBI toward palladium. Thus, palladium is readily released to solution. In the absence of a reasonable ligand, such catalyst might well undergo over-reduction, affording palladium black or palladium mirror prior to completion of the reaction. Using a more rigid support, with reduction of the coordinating groups, might activate the palladium catalyst by promoting a higher degree of coordinative unsaturation while simultaneously retarding palladium ag- gregation. Therefore, we have used silica gel as support to synthesize three amino-functionalized palladium catalysts. The amino-functionalized silica was prepared by treating silica gel with chloromethyltriethoxysilane followed by reacted with an amine (aniline, 2-aminopyridme or 3-aminopyridme). Palladium acetate was anchored to the resulting amino-functionalized silica to give the colored complexes. The color of the aniline derivative was reddish brown, and the other two were orange. All were reduced to black species (V, VI, VII) upon interaction with lithium aluminum hydride in THF at room temperature (Scheme 3). These silica-supported Pd species (reduced) are very stable to air and moisture. ESCA analyses showed that the Pds/z and Pds/a binding energies for catalyst VII, referred to Cis (285.0 eV), were 340.5 and 335.0 eV, respectively. The palladium 3d binding energy data indicated the presence of Pd(0) species. The detailed structures of these reduced species are under investigation in order to determine whether these are metallic Pd(0) species or coordinatively unsaturated Pd(0) complexes.

The results are presented in Table 2. When these reactions were carried out at 100 C for 2 h, (2? )-stilbene or (E )-cinnamamide was obtained in good yield (78-89%), indicating the high catalytic activity of these catalysts. In the case of catalyst VII, these reactions could be completed in 0.5 h at 130 C. Catalyst VII was the most active among these catalysts. Though only a trace of catalyst VII (0.00477 mol% based on halide) was used, good yields (80%) were obtained for both reactions. At this point the catalyst VII had a turnover number exceeding 16700. To evaluate the activity of catalyst VII, styrene was reacted with iodobenzene in the presence of catalyst, and the progress of the reaction was followed by HPLC. Aliquots were taken periodically from the reactor and analyzed by HPLC to determine the yield of (E)-stilbene. As shown in the plots of yield us. time (Fig. 1), in the case of catalyst VII the catalytic rate at 100 C was lower in the initial 15 min than that ofPd(OAc)2.

The reaction with catalyst VII was completed faster than that with Pd(OAc)a, and the efficiency of VII was also higher (Table 3). These silica-supported palladium catalysts could also be re-used for the reaction of styrene with iodobenzene by using tributylamine as base (Table 4). However, the activity of catalyst V was dramatically reduced after two cycles. This could be ascribed to the weaker coordinating ability of the aniline moiety in the amino-functionalized silica gel. It is apparent from the data in Table 4 that the lifetimes of VI and VII were longer than those of catalysts I [2], II [3] and III [4]. This result suggests that the use of silica gel as support can improve the stability of the catalyst and reduce metal leaching from the support. Catalyst VII was the best among these catalysts: it has been recycled up to eleven times with no decrease in activity. In the case of catalyst VI, activity appeared to gradually reduce after nine cycles. This was probably due to the lessened steric hindrance around the coordinative nitrogen atom in the pyridine residue of VII, thus the ligand in the polymeric TABLE 3 The efficiency of catalyst Vn No. Catalyst React, completion Catalyst efficiency cat. mg 10-3 mmol Temp.( C) time (min) yield(%) product (mmol) product/pd.min 1\"y3-4b Pd(OAc)2virPd(OAc)2 VIT 0.46 17.4 18.2 238 2.1 2.1 81 28 130 130 100 100 40 30 20 40 71.5 74 75 74 5.1 5.3 15 14.8 61.4 84.6 9.3 13.2 \"Carried out with 7.2 mmol iodobenzene, 7.92 mmol styrene, 7.92 nunol Bu3N and 2 ml DMF.

In order to examine the reactivity of catalyst VII, a variety of substituted iodobenzenes were reacted with olefins in the presence of catalyst VII. The results obtained are summarized in Table 5. In all cases, good to excellent yields were obtained. These indicated that catalyst VII could tolerate the presence of a variety of functional groups. However, catalyst VII was not effective for the Heck reaction of bromide. When catalyst III was used for the reaction of bromobenzene with styrene at 130 C for 2 h, stilbene was obtained in good yield (80%) [4]. By contrast, only traces of product were found when catalyst VII was used for the same reaction, even if the reaction was performed at 130 C for 12 h.

Three amino-functionalized silica-supported palladium catalysts have been synthesized. These catalysts displayed high activity for the Heck reaction of iodobenzene with olefins. By using XXX—aminopyridine-palladium, a turnover number exceeding 16700 was observed for the reaction of iodobenzene with styrene or acrylamide. This catalyst can be recovered and reused by using tributylamine as base. It can also tolerate the presence of a variety of functional groups. References 1 B.F. Heck Org. React. 27 1982 345 2 Z.Y.
