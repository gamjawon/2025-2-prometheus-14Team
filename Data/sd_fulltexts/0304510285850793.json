H. ELLESTAD* Central Institute for Industrial Research, P.O. Box 350, Blindem, Oslo 3 (Norway) (Received May 24, 1984) NiO when reacted with TiCl4 and subsequently with Et^AlCl was pre- viously reported to give polymeric products [1]. This was explained by the usual formation of Ziegler type Ti(III)Clx catalytic sites on the surface of the nickel oxide support which mainly influenced the stereospecificity of the polypropylene product. Recently we reported that Oligomerization of propene occurred using catalysts made from reactions between nickel oxide surfaces, TiCl4 and diethylaluminium chloride. When employing Et3Al no activity was observed, and with monoethylaluminium chloride the reaction with TiCl4 had no influence on the Oligomerization activity [2]. The activity was attributed to catalytic sites formed by surface Ni2\"1\" ions complexed with the aluminium compound. The effect of TiC4 was mainly to stabilize the Ni2\"1\" ions from reduction by the cocatalyst. It is well established that homogeneous Ni(I) catalysts oligomerize alkenes ([3] and references therein), and the industrial Dimersol process has been developed on this basis [4]. In the literature, homogeneous Co(II) as well as Co(I) complexes have also been reported to be active catalysts for ethene and propene dimerization [5-7]. In addition, solid Co-based cata- lysts have been prepared by impregnation of Co(II) salts on various supports. Reactions with alkenes [8] or isoprene [9] gave oligomeric or polymeric products, respectively. It was of some interest to compare our previous results for NiO [2] with CoO-based systems, and also to include Co^Oa to see if the variation of the oxidation number of the metal has any influence. The results are re- ported in this note. Isomorphous Ni(OH)2 and Co(OH)2 with Cdl; structure (oxides of cubic Nad structure) and Co(OH)3 (C3m) (all from Roc/Ric) were calcined to their respective oxides in a stream of dry N3 at 450 C for 20 h. This is well above the respective decomposition temperatures. The oxides were reacted with l M solutions of TiCl4 in heptane for 3 h. The liquid was *Present address: Statoil, 4001 Stavanger, Norway. 0304-5102/85/$3.30 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 120 TABLE 1 Catalytic data for oligomerization of propene Support Anchored Ti Product (%) (g) NiO 3.1 U'1'11 CoO 0.83 4e CoiOa 0.95 10 \"Oligomeric products, complete reaction of the propene.

The experi- ments were performed under rigorous inert Ar atmosphere conditions. The anchored Ti was analysed as a Ti/HssO^/H^O^ complex by visible spec- troscopy at 410 nm. For further details see ref. 2. The catalytic tests were carried out using l g catalyst, 5 ml 0.4 M Et^AlCl and ca. 10-15 g propene (Phillips, polymerization grade) in Parr autoclaves with stirring for 20 h at ambient temperature. The data are given in Table 1; the distribution of Cs-isomers is listed in Table 2. The results can be given an explanation consistent with previous observations. For the cobalt(II) oxide-based system, titanium(IV) is reduced and forms Ziegler Ti-sites on the surface, with the oxide acting mainly as a support influencing activity, chain length and stereoregularity of the poly- meric product. Accordingly, for the given calcination conditions the catalyst 121 behaves as the NiO/TiCl^/EtzAlCl and SiOz/Codz/Et^AlCl systems which are reported to give polymeric products [1,9]. The Co^Oa/TiCLc/EtiAlCl catalyst behaved differently and produced dimeric products, as previously reported for our NiO/TiCLc /Et2AlCl system [2]. The results can be given an analogous interpretation. When Co(OH)3 is heated above 300 C, water and oxygen are evolved with the formation of 304 [10]. The actual oxidation number or structure of the surface is not established, but most likely the upper layers consist of a mixture of Co(III) and Co(II) ions in an oxide and hydroxide matrix. TiCl4 may react with surface hydroxyl groups and possible metal oxygen bonds, as is the case for CoO and NiO [2]. The Co(III) ions have strong oxidation power, and they are likely to be reduced to Co(II) when Et^AlCl is admitted. The Co(III) ions may also stabilize Co(II) ions on the surface by preventing further reduction to Co(I) or Co(0), and thereby hamper or diminish a reduction of Ti(IV) to Ti(III). Thus, just as for the corresponding NiO system [2, 11], the oligomerization- active sites may consist of Co(II) ions stabilized by Co(III) and Ti(IV)Clx groups. Significant variations in the distributions of Ce-isomers for the NiO and Co^Oa based systems appear, as shown in Table 2. The Co203-based catalyst gives considerably less 2-methylpentenes and dimethylbutenes, and corre- spondingly more 4-methylpentenes than the related NiO-based system. This can be explained by a dominating Markownikoff formation of the o-Co- propene complex, while the NiO system favours the anti-Markownikoff-type complex according to the following accepted oligomerization mechanism [12,13]: Anti-Markownikoff Ni H + 2-methyl-1-pentene(+) t C ^\"S ^t^c^ ,, c C C * ./11 C C S-6 -NI-C ^^Y\\^^^ \\^ * f-y c' j. c NiH v \\c - or -< || CoH c 'i c ^ c ^* ^ c3\"e */c-c ^\\/\\ * ^-/^ Co c' .

Generally, higher amounts of the more thermodynamically stable isomers with the double bond in the 2-position were favoured by the longer resi- 122 dence time in the autoclave, compared to previously published data for the NiO system where glass apparatus and 30 min reaction time were employed [2]. Also, pressure variations may influence the mechanism [6]. Concerning the product variations, it is experimentally well established that nickel and cobalt oxides reacted with TiCl4 may give polymeric or oligo- meric products [1,2,9]. This is further confirmed by own experiments where VCl4 deposited on the same NiO and 00303 supports polymerized propene, although with relatively low molecular weights. This observation may be explained by a substantial surface coverage of active Ziegler polymer- ization centres (5.6% V for 203), which dominate the reaction pattern and also are able to include in the polymerization sequence oligomeric products from possibly exposed metal oxide sites. When the surface is only partially covered by the Ziegler catalyst precursor, as in this and the previous study [2], it seems possible to form Ti surface sites which can act in conjunction with catalytic centres from the metal oxide to form active oligomerization centres, as shown. Generation of one or the other type of surface species may be strongly modified by factors such as starting material for preparation of the metal oxide, calcination temperatures and other experimental details. This may also influence the amount of residual chloride acting as ligands to the surface species which may contribute to the polymerization activity.
