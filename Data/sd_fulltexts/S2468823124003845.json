Molybdate-intercalated magnesium–aluminum hydrotalcite-like compounds (HTlc) were synthesized by anion-exchange and used as precursor to prepare supported molybdenum nitride catalyst for ammonia decomposition. The as-synthesized precursors and the derived mixed metal oxides and nitride catalysts were characterized by ICP, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, XPS, H2-TPR, and HAADF-STEM-EDX. The characterizations indicated that molybdate was well intercalated into the HTlc interlayer as MoO4 2– and the Mo content was tunable by altering the intercalation degree of molybdate. Upon calcination, molybdena was dominantly presented as isolated tetrahedrally coordinated MoO x species. Upon nitridation with ammonia at 700 ºC, highly dispersed and composition-uniform molybdenum nitride (Mo2± x N) was formed. The Mo0.5Mg3Al nitride catalyst showed good activity for ammonia decomposition, providing nearly full conversion of ammonia at 625 ºC under a space velocity of 5,000 mL gcat –1 h–1. The optimal catalyst also exhibited high catalytic stability during 100 h operation at 625 ºC, and no obvious aggregation took place, attributable to the strong metal–support interaction between molybdenum nitride and Mg–Al mixed oxide. It is suggested that the hydrotalcite-derived Mg–Al mixed oxide supported highly dispersed Mo2± x N species was active and stable for ammonia decomposition.

However, there have been many difficulties in the handling and storage of hydrogen for practical applications. To address this issue, researchers have been searching for an effective hydrogen carrier such as methanol, formic acid, ammonia, hydrazine, and ammonia borane [1–3]. Among various hydrogen carriers, ammonia is regarded as an appropriate candidate due to its high hydrogen storage capacity (17.6 wt%), ease of storage and transport, and safety against fire and explosion. Moreover, catalytic ammonia decomposition produces CO x -free hydrogen, and the unconverted ammonia can be reduced to less than 200 ppb level by using a suitable adsorber. For these advantages, the use of ammonia for on-site hydrogen generation has very good prospects. So far, great efforts have been made to develop efficient catalysts for ammonia decomposition by using precious metals (e.g. Ru, Ir, Pt, Rh), non-precious metals (e.g., Fe, Co, Ni), and transition metal carbides and nitrides [4–14]. Among the investigated catalysts, the Ru catalyst has shown the highest catalytic activity at low temperatures and represents the state-of-the-art catalyst for ammonia decomposition. However, the large-scale application of Ru catalyst is limited by its high cost and low availability. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop cost-effective non-precious metal catalysts for practical applications. In this regard, transition metal nitrides (TMNs) such as molybdenum nitrides appear one of the alternatives due to their precious-metal-like catalytic properties [15,16]. Bulk molybdenum nitrides, bimetallic nitrides (e.g., CoMoN, NiMoN, FeMoN), and their supported catalysts have been studied for ammonia decomposition [17–35]. Recently, Huo et al. [35] reported the preparation of highly dispersed molybdenum nitride nanocrystals embedded within two-dimensional mesoporous silica (SBA)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) hybrid nanosheets via a nanocasting route. The prepared Mo2N/SBA-15/rGO and MoN/SBA-15/rGO catalysts showed nearly full ammonia conversion at 600 ºC under a space velocity of 30,000 mL gcat –1 h–1, appearing to be one of the most active non-precious metal catalysts reported to date. It was shown that MoN/SBA-15/rGO and MoN/SBA-15 exhibited excellent stability at 600 ºC over 50 h. However, Mo2N/SBA-15/rGO and Mo2N/SBA-15 underwent deactivation due to the phase transformation from Mo2N to MoN, whereas MoN/rGO and Mo2N/rGO were deactivated due to the agglomeration of nitride nanoparticles. The high-temperature deactivation of supported molybdenum nitride catalysts was also reported in several studies [29,33]. Therefore, more efforts are needed to develop supported molybdenum nitride catalyst with good activity and high-temperature stability. Hydrotalcite-like compounds (HTlc), also known as layered double hydroxides (LDHs), have been widely used as precursors for catalyst preparation due to their unique structural properties and composition versatility [36–40]. HTlc are a class of anionic clay materials and their formula can be generally described as [M2+ 1− x M3+ x (OH)2][An− x /n·zH2O], where M2+ = Mg2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, etc.; M3+ = Al3+, Fe3+, etc.; An− = CO3 2−, OH−, Cl−, NO3 −, etc.; x generally varies between 0.2 and 0.33. The structure of HTlc consists of positively charged brucite-like layers with interlayers filled by anions and water molecules to maintain overall charge neutrality. One property of HTlc is that upon thermal decomposition it can be converted into well-dispersed mixed metal oxides (MMOs) with high surface area, good thermal stability, and basicity, which make them as promising catalyst supports. Another important property of HTlc is its ability to intercalate catalytic active anionic species (e.g. molybdate) within the interlayer [41–43]. These attractive properties motivate us to prepare molybdenum nitride catalyst by using HTlc as precursor. In this study, molybdate-intercalated Mg–Al HTlc was synthesized by anion-exchange and used as precursor to prepare supported molybdenum nitride catalyst. Nitrate-intercalated Mg–Al HTlc was synthesized by co-precipitation and used as the parent HTlc; then various contents of molybdate were intercalated into the HTlc interlayer by anion-exchange, followed by calcination and nitridation treatments. The anion-exchange method has been used to synthesize HTlc intercalated with anions such as molybdate [41–43] and tungstate [43]. The as-synthesized HTlc precursors and their derived mixed metal oxides and nitride catalysts were characterized by various techniques in order to understand the state of molybdenum during the preparation process. It is found that the HTlc-derived molybdenum nitride was highly dispersed and composition-unform and showed good activity and stability for ammonia decomposition. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation All chemicals including ammonium paramolybdate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O), magnesium nitrate (Mg(NO3)2·6H2O), aluminum nitrate (Al(NO3)3·9H2O), sodium nitrate (NaNO3), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were analysis grade and used as purchased. The de-ionized water was decarbonated by boiling and used for synthesizing and washing. Firstly, the parent Mg3Al–NO3 HTlc was synthesized by constant pH co-precipitation at room temperature. Under magnetic stirring, a mixed aqueous solution of Mg and Al nitrates (molar ratio Mg:Al = 3:1) was dropped into a NaNO3 aqueous solution (molar ratio NO3:Al = 1:1). The solution pH was maintained at 10±0.5 by dropwise adding a NaOH aqueous solution (2 mol L−1) with a peristatic pump connected to a pH controller. The resulting precipitate was filtered, washed, and dried at 100 ºC overnight. Subsequently, molybdate-intercalated Mg3Al HTlc was prepared by anion-exchange. A portion of Mg3Al–NO3 HTlc was added to an aqueous solution containing a desired amount of (NH4)6Mo7O24 and kept for 24 h. After that, the sample was filtered, washed, and dried. The as-synthesized precursors were calcined in air at 500 ºC for 5 h to yield mixed metal oxides. The calcined product was grounded to powders and pressed into a disk, followed by crushing and sieving to get 30–60 mesh particles (0.3 − 0.6 mm). Finally, temperature-programmed nitridation was performed under ammonia flow (25 mL min–1) with 50 mg calcined sample in a fixed-bed reactor. The temperature was raised from room temperature to 700 ºC at a ramp rate of 10 ºC min−1 and held at 700 ºC for 0.5 h. The obtained precursors, mixed metal oxides, and nitride catalysts were denoted as Mo x Mg3Al-HT, Mo x Mg3Al-MMOs, and Mo x Mg3Al-N, respectively, where x was the nominal Mo/Al molar ratio in the metal precursors (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5). The actual Mo atomic content and mass content measured by ICP are listed in Table 1 . 2.2 Catalyst characterizations The relative contents of Mg, Al, and Mo in the as-synthesized precursors were measured by inductive coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP OES) on a Perkin-Elmer OPTIMA 8000 spectrometer after dissolving the precursor with diluted hydrochloric acid. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was measured using a PANalytical X'PertPro diffractometer with Co Ka radiation (λ = 1.789 Å) operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed on a Nicolet 6700 infrared spectrometer with KBr pellets. The spectra were recorded in the range of 400–4000 cm–1 with a resolution of 4 cm–1. Raman spectroscopy was taken on a RenishawinVia Reflex Raman spectrometer using Ar ion laser (532 nm) as the excitation source. N2 physisorption was conducted at –196 ºC on a Micrometrics ASAP 2020 apparatus. Before the measurement, the sample was treated in vacuum at 250 ºC for 2 h. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) was taken on a Hitachi S-4800 microscope operated at 5.0 kV. High-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) combined with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis was conducted on a JEOL JEM-2100F microscope operated at 200 kV. Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was measured on a Micrometrics AutoChem 2920 instrument. About 100 mg of the calcined sample was treated in Ar flow at 300 ºC for 0.5 h. After cooling to room temperature, the sample was reduced with 10 %H2/Ar (30 mL min–1) by raising the temperature to 800 ºC at a ramp rate of 10 ºC min–1. The consumption of H2 was recorded with a thermal conductivity detector. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi spectrometer using Al Ka X-ray radiation (1486.6 eV). The binding energy of adventitious C 1 s peak (284.8 eV) was used as a reference for charge correction. 2.3 Catalytic performance tests The catalyst performance for ammonia decomposition reaction was evaluated in a fixed-bed continuous flow quartz reactor at atmospheric pressure. Pure ammonia was used as the feed gas, and the flow rate was kept constant at 25 mL min–1 with a mass flow controller. The space velocity (SV = 5000–30,000 mL gcat –1 h–1) was varied by adjusting the catalyst weight (calcined sample, 50–300 mg, 30–60 mesh). The reaction temperature was controlled by a programmable temperature controller and monitored with a K-type thermocouple placed inside the catalyst bed. Prior to the test, temperature-programmed nitridation was performed in 25 mL min–1 NH3 flow by raising the temperature from room temperature to 700 ºC at a ramp rate of 10 ºC min–1 and holding at 700 ºC for 0.5 h. In the activity tests, the reaction temperature was increased from 350 to 800 ºC at 25 ºC intervals; at each temperature, the reaction was maintained for 0.5 h. In the stability test, the reaction was run at 625 ºC for 100 h under SV = 10,000 mL gcat –1 h–1. The concentration of the outlet gases including N2 and NH3 was analyzed by an online gas chromatography (GC9790 II) equipped with a Poropak-Q column and a thermal conductivity detector using H2 as the carrier gas. The ammonia conversion was calculated by the equation: conversion (%) = [(NH3)in–(NH3)out]/(NH3)in × 100 %, where (NH3)in was the flow rate of NH3 in the inlet gas, and (NH3)out was the flow rate of NH3 in the outlet gas. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of the HTlc precursors The SEM images of the as-synthesized HTlc precursors are provided in Fig. S1, from which a randomly oriented nanoplate morphology characteristic of HTlc was observed. The actual metal compositions of the HTlc precursors measured by ICP are given in Table 1. The Mg/Al atomic ratio for the parent Mg3Al–NO3 HTlc was in good agreement with the value in the starting salt solution. Nonetheless, it was somewhat lower for the molybdate-containing precursors. Similar result had been reported previously [41,42] and it might be ascribed to the preferential dissolution of Mg2+ in the low-pH molybdate aqueous solution during exchange due to the larger basicity of Mg2+ than Al3+. On the other hand, the Mo/Al atomic ratio was close to the nominal value, suggesting that molybdate was well intercalated into the interlayer. For Mo0.5Mg3Al-HT, the Mo/Al atomic ratio (0.46) was approached to that (Mo/Al = 0.5) required for compensating the positive charge due to the presence of Al3+ cations in the brucite-like layers given molybdate (e.g. MoO4 2−) replacing all the initial anions in the parent HTlc; the intercalation degree was as high as 0.92. Thus, it was capable of tuning the Mo content by altering the intercalation degree of molybdate. The XRD patterns of the HTlc precursors are shown in Fig. 1A , all of which displayed only the diffraction peaks of HTlc. The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 12.2º, 24.5º, 40.3º, 44.6º, 53.1º, 71.5º, and 72.8º could be indexed to the (003), (006), (012), (015), (018), (110), and (113) reflections of HTlc with a rhombohedral R3m symmetry, respectively. The peak intensity decreased with the increase of Mo content, suggesting a decrease in the crystallinity. It is noticed that the basal (003) and (006) peaks were shifted to lower angles compared to the Mg3Al–CO3 HTlc standard diffractogram. According to the layered structure of HTlc, the basal reflections are relevant with the interlayer space, and the d 003 spacing corresponds to the sum of one interlayer distance and one brucite-like layer thickness. The interlayer distance is dependent on the charge and size of the intercalated anions as well as the positive charge of the brucite-like layers. As listed in Table 1, the lattice parameter c (c = 3d 003) was calculated to be 25.266 Å for Mg3Al–NO3 HTlc, which was similar to that reported in the literature [44] and larger than that of Mg3Al–CO3 HTlc (c = 23.23 Å JCPDS 14–0191). This was because nitrate was less negatively charged than carbonate so that the electrostatic attraction between the interlayer and the brucite-like layer was weak, leading to larger interlayer space. Upon exchanging with a small amount of molybdate (x ≤ 0.2), the parameter c decreased slightly, which might be ascribed to the intercalation of more negatively charged molybdate that strengthened the electrostatic attraction between brucite-like layer and interlayer. With further increasing the molybdate content, an increase in the parameter c was observed. This might be ascribed to the expansion of interlayer distance due to the larger ionic radius of molybdate (2.46 Å for MoO4 2–) [45] than nitrate (2.04 Å). Table 1 also lists the lattice parameter a estimated from the (110) reflection (a = 2d 110). The parameter a is related to the average distance of metal–metal cations in the brucite-like layers. Since the ionic radius of Al3+ (0.535 Å) is smaller than that of Mg2+ (0.72 Å) [46], the parameter a decreased slightly with the decrease of Mg/Al atomic ratio. Fig. 1B shows the FTIR spectra of the HTlc precursors, which are typical for HTlc. According to the literature [47–49], the broad bands centered at 3450 cm–1 corresponded to the stretching vibration of hydroxyl groups in the brucite-like layers and the interlayer water molecules, and the band at 1637 cm–1 was due to the bending vibration of water molecules. The weak bands at 2930 and 2810 cm–1 could be ascribed to hydrogen bonds between water and anions. The bands at 1385 and 835 cm–1 could be assigned to the antisymmetric stretching v 3 and out-of-plane bending v 2 vibrations of nitrate. In addition, the shoulder band at 1350 cm–1 was ascribable to the v 3 vibration of carbonate. The presence of carbonate was probably due to contamination from the carbon dioxide present in the aqueous solution and/or the adsorption of CO2 from air. Upon exchange with molybdate, the bands due to nitrate became weak, and meanwhile the band at 838 cm–1 assignable to the Mo=O stretching vibration of molybdate [48] was intensified, indicating that molybdate was intercalated into the interlayer to replace nitrate. The intercalation of molybdate into the HTlc interlayer was further confirmed by Raman spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 1C. For Mg3Al–NO3 HTlc, the bands at 472 and 550 cm–1 could be assigned to the Mg/Al–OH translation models of the brucite-like layers, and those at 715, 1044, and 1054 cm–1 might be attributed to the intercalated nitrate and carbonate anions [47]. Upon exchange with molybdate, the bands due to nitrate were weakened; meanwhile, three new bands at 320, 836, and 896 cm–1 appeared, which got stronger with increasing the Mo content. These bands could be assigned to tetrahedrally coordinated MoO4 2– [47,50]: the band at 320 cm–1 was due to the Mo–O bending vibration, and the bands at 896 and 836 cm–1 corresponded to the Mo–O symmetric and antisymmetric stretching vibrations, respectively. These variances confirmed the intercalation of molybdate into the interlayer to replace nitrate. It is well known that the molecular structure of molybdate is sensitive to the solution pH. MoO4 2– is stable at pH >6.5, while polymolybdate is formed upon acidification [50]. The parent Mg3Al–NO3 HTlc is a basic material, which processes a number of hydroxyl groups at the brucite-like layers. So, molybdate might present as MoO4 2– monomer in the HTlc interlayer. The TG-DTG profiles of the HTlc precursors are depicted in Fig. 1D, which displayed a two-step weight loss typical for HTlc [36]. The first weight loss at 100−300 ºC corresponded to the removal of interlayer water and physically adsorbed water, and the second weight loss at 300−500 ºC was assigned to the dehydroxylation and elimination of interlayer anions, after which the layer structure collapsed and HTlc was converted into MMOs. The first weight loss was similar for all HTlc precursors, while the second weight loss decreased for molybdate-intercalated HTlc due to the replacement of nitrate with molybdenate. Notably, the DTG peak of the second weight loss moved towards higher temperatures from 400 to 505 ºC, indicating an improved thermal stability by intercalation of molybdate. This might be attributed to the strong interaction between molybdate and brucite-like layers via forming hydrogen bonds. According to TG, the thermal decomposition of HTlc was almost completed at ∼500 ºC, which was therefore chosen as the calcination temperature. 3.2 Characterization of the mixed metal oxides and nitride catalysts Fig. 2A shows the XRD patterns of the calcined samples. The broad diffraction peaks at 2θ = 42.1º, 50.2º, 74.1º, 89.6º, and 95.0º could be assigned to the poorly crystalline Mg(Al)O mixed oxide, where Al3+ was incorporated into the MgO lattice [51,52]. This was confirmed by a slight shift of diffraction peaks to higher angles compared to MgO standard diffractogram. With increasing the Mo content, the diffraction peaks of Mg(Al)O became weak, and additional peaks at 2θ = 43.2º, 52.6º, 70.2º, and 77.6º assignable to MgAl2O4 spinel appeared. This might be ascribed to the loss of Mg during the exchange process, which gave rise to local Al-rich domains and yielded MgAl2O4 upon calcination. Noteworthily, no diffraction peaks corresponding to molybdenum compounds such as MoO3 and MgMoO4 were discerned, indicating that the molybdenum oxide (MoO x ) was highly dispersed. Raman spectroscopy was further employed to investigate the structure of the Mo oxide on the calcined samples, as shown in Fig. 2B. There was no observation of a band at around 220 cm–1, which is diagnostic of the Mo–O–Mo deformation for polymolybdate [50], suggesting that the molybdena was an isolated species. Besides, no bands due to MoO3 (ca. 994, 818, 281 cm–1) [50] were discerned, indicating the absence of MoO3. The bands at 903 and 316 cm–1 could be assigned to the Mo–O symmetric stretching and bending vibration of isolated tetrahedrally coordinated molybdena species, respectively [50]. These bands were intensified with the increase of Mo content and were dominant in all Raman spectra. At high Mo contents (x = 0.3–0.5), several new bands emerged at 955, 863, and 345 cm–1, which could be assigned to MgMoO4 [50]. The band at 863 cm–1 was due to the Mo–O–Mg stretching vibration, and those at 955 and 345 cm–1 corresponded to the Mo–O stretching and bending vibrations, respectively. These Raman bands were relatively sharp but weak, implying the presence of a small amount of nanocrystalline MgMoO4. The presence of MgMoO4 indicated the formation of chemical bond between MoO x and MgO, signifying a strong metal–support interaction (SMSI). It could be deduced from the Raman spectra that the calcined samples contained mainly isolated tetrahedrally coordinated MoO x species that closely interacted with the Mg–Al mixed oxides. The oxidation state of MoO x in the calcined samples was investigated by XPS. As shown in Fig. 2C, the Mo 3d XPS spectra displayed two peaks, corresponding to the spin-orbit doublet 3d5/2 and 3d3/2. The spin-orbit splitting was ∼3.2 eV and the peak area ratio of Mo 3d5/2 to Mo 3d3/2 was about 1.5. With increasing the Mo content, the binding energies (BEs) of Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 increased slightly from 232.40 to 232.62 eV and from 235.56 to 235.75 eV, respectively. The high BEs could be assigned to Mo6+ [17–19,25,29,35], and the increase of BEs suggested an enhanced interaction between MoO x and support. The H2-TPR profiles of the Mo x Mg3Al-MMOs are shown in Fig. 2D. All of the samples displayed only one high-temperature reduction peak. With increasing the Mo content, the reduction peak moved towards higher temperatures from 596 ºC to 670 ºC. The reduction peak could be assigned to the highly dispersed MoO x species that had interaction with the Mg–Al mixed oxides. The high-temperature shift of the reduction peak indicated an enhanced metal–support interaction, in general agreement with the results of Raman spectroscopy and Mo 3d XPS. The Mo x Mg3Al-N nitride catalysts were obtained by temperature-programmed nitration with ammonia over the mixed metal oxides. As shown in Fig. 3A , the XRD patterns of the nitride catalysts resembled those of the calcined samples, although the peak intensity increased to some extent due to the crystal growth during the high-temperature nitridation treatment. There was no observation of diffraction peaks due to molybdenum nitride (Mo2N or MoN), suggesting that the molybdenum nitride species was highly dispersed. The formation of molybdenum nitride was examined by XPS. Fig. 3B shows the Mo 3d XPS spectra of the nitride catalysts. The Mo 3d spectrum could be deconvoluted into three couple peaks. The peaks at 228.4 and 231.6 eV were assigned to Mo2+, and the peaks at 229.7 and 232.8 eV were attributed to Moδ+ (2<δ<4), whereas the peaks at 232.5 and 235.6 eV were due to Mo6+ [17–19,25,29,35]. The presence of Mo2+ and Moδ+ could be related to molybdenum nitride [17,53], and the presence of Mo6+ might be due to the incomplete nitridation and/or the oxidation of molybdenum nitride upon exposure to air [17]. The Mo 3p–N 1 s XPS spectra of the nitride catalysts are provided in Fig. S3. The peak at 410–420 eV corresponded to Mo 3p1/2, whereas the peak at 390–402 eV involved Mo 3p3/2 and N 1 s [53,54]. We had tried to calculate the N 1 s peak area from the Mo 3p3/2–N 1 s peak area [54]: the Mo 3p3/2 peak area was estimated from the Mo 3p1/2 peak area (the theoretical value of the Mo 3p3/2 to Mo 3p1/2 peak area ratio is 2/1), and the N 1 s peak area was obtained by subtracting the Mo 3p3/2 peak area from the Mo 3p3/2–N 1 s peak area. Then, the Mo:N atomic ratio was calculated from the Mo 3p3/2 to N 1 s peak area ratio. The chemical compositions calculated from XPS are listed in Table 2 . Generally, the surface Mg/Al atomic ratio was lower than the bulk value measured by ICP, which might be ascribed to the surface enrichment of Al in the Mg(Al)O solid solution [55]. The surface Mo content was similar to the bulk content determined by ICP, suggesting the uniform distribution of Mo. The Mo:N atomic ratio was estimated to be 1.8∼2.4, which might imply the formation of Mo2± x N species. To gain further information about the dispersion state of molybdenum, HAADF-STEM- EDX measurement was performed on the Mo0.5Mg3Al-HT, MMOs, and nitride samples. As can be seen from Fig. 4a , molybdenum was highly dispersed and well mixed with magnesium and aluminum in the HTlc precursor. According to the layered structure of HTlc, molybdate (MoO4 2−) was intercalated into the interlayer between the positively charged brucite-like layers through the electrostatic attraction. Therefore, the uniform distribution of positive charge in the brucite-like layers would determine the distribution of molybdate in the interlayer in a similar way. It is envisioned that the layered structure of HTlc provides a confinement effect for molybdate, which favors the dispersion of molybdate and improves its thermal stability against aggregation. Afte calcination, molybdenum still remained high dispersion (Fig. 4b). This is in accordance with the presence of isolated tetrahedrally coordinated MoO x species that closely interacted with the Mg–Al mixed oxides. Upon nitridation, nitrogen was presented and evenly distributed with molybdenum, as shown in Fig. 4c, confirming the formation of highly dispersed molybdenum nitride. By EDX line scan analysis, the molar ratio of Mo:N was determined to vary in a narrow range between 1.8 and 2.2, suggesting that the molybdenum nitride had relatively uniform composition. These results revealed the formation of composition-uniform, highly dispersed, and thermally stable Mo2± x N species. It has been indicated that Mo16N7 and Mo2N are more active than MoN for ammonia decomposition [32,35,56]. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore-size distributions of the nitrided samples are displayed in Fig. S2. The BET specific surface area, total pore volume, and average pore diameter are listed in Table 1. All samples displayed an IV-type isotherm with a H3-like hysteresis loop at the range of p/p 0 = 0.4∼1.0 and showed the presence of mesopores with the most probable pore diameter around 3.5 nm and an average pore diameter of ∼5 nm. All samples had a relatively high BET specific surface area, attributable to the good sintering-resistance of Mg(Al)O mixed oxides [55]. The BET specific surface area decreased at higher Mo contents, which might be ascribed to the formation of crystalline MgAl2O4 spinel. 3.3 Catalytic performance for ammonia decomposition Fig. 5A shows the catalytic activities of the Mg3AlMo x -N nitride catalysts with various Mo contents for ammonia decomposition as a function of reaction temperature at SV = 30,000 mL gcat –1 h–1. The ammonia conversion increased significantly with the rise of temperature because ammonia decomposition is an endothermic reaction. The catalyst activity increased progressively with the increase of Mo content, and the highest activity was obtained on the Mo0.5Mg3Al-N catalyst, which afforded nearly full ammonia conversion at 675 ºC. Based on the conversion data, the Arrhenius plots for ammonia decomposition were established, as shown in Fig. 5B. The apparent activation energy (E a) was calculated to be 126–135 kJ mol–1, which was similar to those reported for γ-Mo2N [17,18] and MoN@C [33] and lower than those for Mo2N/rGO and MoN/rGO [35]. Fig. 5C shows the catalytic activities of the best Mo0.5Mg3Al-N catalyst under different space velocities. As expected, the ammonia conversion increased with decreasing the space velocity. Nearly full ammonia conversion was reached at 650 ºC and 625 ºC as the space velocity was decreased to 10,000 and 5000 mL gcat –1 h–1, respectively, indicating that the Mo2± x N species was effective for ammonia decomposition. Table S1 compares the catalytic activities of Mo nitride catalysts for ammonia decomposition. Although Mo0.5Mg3Al-N was less active than Mo2N/SBA-15/rGO and MoN/SBA-15/rGO [35], it performed better than the Mo catalysts supported on carbon fiber [34], reduced graphene oxide (rGO) [35], Y-doped ZrO2 (YSZ) [26], and SBA-15 [30] as well as the bulk ones prepared from MoO3 [20,32]. Further, the long-time stability test over the Mo0.5Mg3Al catalyst was investigated at 625 ºC under a space velocity of 10,000 mL gcat –1 h–1, as depicted in Fig. 5D. It was observed that the ammonia conversion gradually increased from initial 95 % to >99 % at the early 20 h and thereafter remained stable up to 100 h on stream. Similar induction behavior had been frequently reported for the Mo catalysts [17,29,33] and it might be ascribed to the enhanced nitridation degree of molybdenum under the reaction atmosphere. The XRD measurement of the used catalyst showed no marked change in the crystalline phase (Fig. S4), and no crystalline phase due to molybdenum nitride was identified. The HAADF-STEM-EDX images of the used catalyst are shown in Fig. 4d. Even upon high-temperature long-time operation, the molybdenum nitride still remained highly dispersed, and the Mo:N molar ratio did not change a lot. It is suggested that the highly dispersed Mo2± x N species was stable against sintering under the reaction conditions. These results indicate that the hydrotalcite-derived highly dispersed and stable Mo nitride catalyst can be potential candidate for ammonia decomposition. To meet the practical application requirement, further studies to improve the catalyst activity are in progress in our group. 4 Conclusions Molybdate-intercalated Mg–Al hydrotalcite-like compounds with various contents of molybdenum were obtained by anion-exchange. Calcination of HTlc produced mixed metal oxides consisting of mainly isolated tetrahedrally coordinated MoO x species and Mg(Al)O with close interaction. Upon nitridation, highly dispersed and composition-uniform molybdenum nitride (Mo2± x N) was formed. The catalyst activity for ammonia decomposition increased with the increase of Mo content, and the highest activity was obtained on the Mo0.5Mg3Al nitride catalyst. It showed nearly full conversion of ammonia at 625 ºC under a space velocity of 5000 mL gcat –1 h–1, and exhibited high catalytic stability during 100 h test without obvious aggregation. It is suggested that the hydrotalcite-derived Mg–Al mixed oxide supported highly dispersed Mo2± x N species was active and stable for ammonia decomposition. These results demonstrated the feasibility of preparing supported molybdenum nitride catalyst from molybdate-intercalated HTlc.

        "dc:description": "Molybdate-intercalated magnesium–aluminum hydrotalcite-like compounds (HTlc) were synthesized by anion-exchange and used as precursor to prepare supported molybdenum nitride catalyst for ammonia decomposition. The as-synthesized precursors and the derived mixed metal oxides and nitride catalysts were characterized by ICP, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, XPS, H2-TPR, and HAADF-STEM-EDX. The characterizations indicated that molybdate was well intercalated into the HTlc interlayer as MoO4 2– and the Mo content was tunable by altering the intercalation degree of molybdate. Upon calcination, molybdena was dominantly presented as isolated tetrahedrally coordinated MoO x species. Upon nitridation with ammonia at 700 ºC, highly dispersed and composition-uniform molybdenum nitride (Mo2± x N) was formed. The Mo0.5Mg3Al nitride catalyst showed good activity for ammonia decomposition, providing nearly full conversion of ammonia at 625 ºC under a space velocity of 5,000 mL gcat –1 h–1. The optimal catalyst also exhibited high catalytic stability during 100 h operation at 625 ºC, and no obvious aggregation took place, attributable to the strong metal–support interaction between molybdenum nitride and Mg–Al mixed oxide. It is suggested that the hydrotalcite-derived Mg–Al mixed oxide supported highly dispersed Mo2± x N species was active and stable for ammonia decomposition.",
