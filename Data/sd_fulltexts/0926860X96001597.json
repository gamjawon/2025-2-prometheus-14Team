Only the zeolite showed exchange with the isopentane at 373 K. The addition of 10% of 2-methyl-l-butene to the isopentane accelerates the exchange with USY zeolite and promotes a small exchange with amorphous silica-alumina and Amberlyst-15. Nevertheless, the selectivity was different. With USY, no olefin was detected in the products, suggesting that they were protonated (deuterated) to give the tertiary carbenium ion, which, after hydride transfer, desorbs as a deuterated isopentane molecule. CP/MAS 13C NMR analysis of the zeolite after exchange showed a significant amount of adsorbed olefinic material. On the other hand, the main reaction on Amberlyst-15 and silica-alumina is the apparent isomerization of 2-methyl-l-butene to 2-methyl-2-butene. The reactivity of the zeolite for the reaction with isopentane is probably due to steric effects, associated with the distortion of the crystalline structure. These effects are absents in Amberlyst-15 and amorphous silica-alumina catalysts. Keywords: Acidity; Amberlyst-15; Isopropanol; Silica-alumina; Zeolites 1.

Although carbocations are believed to be intermediates in alkane reactions over solid acid catalysts, their mechanism of formation is still unclear. One of the problems associated with the study of the mechanism of alkane activation over solid acids is the high temperatures usually used (ca. 673-773 K), which cannot totally prevent the involvement of radical species [1-3]. On the other hand, the mechanism of alkane activation in liquid superacid is well studied .at low to moderate temperatures, evidencing the involvement of pentacoordinated carbo- nium ions [4-7]. We investigated the H-D exchange between zeolites and alkanes at 373 K, to study the mechanism of alkane activation and carbocation formation [8,9]. Initially, we proposed the formation and rearrangement of pentacoordinated carbonium ions [10,11]. However, Sommer and co-workers [12,13], as well as Engelhardt and Hall [14], later showed that the involvement of pentacoordinated carbonium ions is not completely clear. The exchange on zeolites is similar to exchange in sulfuric acid [15,16], which has been attributed to involve carbenium ions and olefins. In sulfuric acid the activation of the alkane and initial formation of carbenium ions is believed to proceed through an oxi-reduction reaction, producing a cation radical and liberating SO2 [17,18]. Nevertheless, zeolites do not usually present oxi-reduction sites and the mecha- nism of alkane activation is still open for discussion. Sommer proposed the dehydrogenation on conjugated Lewis acid and basic sites or formation of a short-lived pentacoordinated carbonium ion, which decomposes to carbenium ion and hydrogen, as possible pathways for the mechanism of alkane activation on zeolites. The purpose of this work is to show recent results of H-D exchange of isopentane on USY, amorphous silica-alumina and Amberlyst-15 catalysts, leading to further insights in the mechanism of activation of small alkanes on solid acid catalysts, especially with respect to the nature and structure of the active site. 2. Experimental part 2.1. Materials A NaUSY zeolite was obtained from Akzo Chemie, Holland. Exchange with 4 M NH4C1 solution at boiling temperature and calcination through a multi-step temperature program, starting at 423 K (30 min), then at 623 K (30 min) and finally at 823 K (120 min) was carried out to afford the HUSY zeolite. The amorphous silica-alumina and Amberlyst-l 5 catalysts were commercial samples obtained from Katalystics and Rohm and Haas Company. The chemical and physical analysis of the catalysts are shown in Table 1. Isopentane was purchased from Riedel and shows a purity greater than 99.5 wt.-%.

Deuterated water (99.8% isotopic purity) was purchased from Aldrich Chemicals. 2.2. H-D exchange About 550 mg of the catalyst were loaded in an U-type glass reactor and pre-treated at 773 K for 30 rain in a flow of 38 ml/min of nitrogen. The temperature was decreased to 473 K and the nitrogen flow driven to a saturator with D20, kept at ambient temperature (ca. 298 K). Deuteration was carried out during 60 min with an additional 15 min of N2 purge. Then, the temperature was adjusted to the desired value, and the N2 flow reduced to 20 ml/min and directed to a saturator, kept at 273 K, containing neat isopentane or mixed with 10% of 2-methyl-l-butene. The hydrocarbon was passed during 15 min, fol- lowed by an additional 15 min of N2 purge, and collected in a condenser immersed in acetone-dry ice bath. 1H and 2H NMR analysis of the collected hydrocarbon were carried out in a Varian VXR-300 spectrometer using a standard mixture of 10% benzene-d6 in benzene, to allow quantification of the exchange. Gas chromatographic analysis were carried out in an HP 5890 A instrument equipped with flame ionization detector. A capillary phenyl-methyl- silicone column (50 m, 0.2 mm, 0.5 ~m) operated at a temperature program starting at 318 K (84 s) and increasing at a rate of 0.8 K/s up to 443 K (252 s) was used to separate the products. Hydrogen was used as carrier gas. For Amberlyst-15, the pre-treatment and deuteration were carried out at 423 K. 3. Results The 2H NMR spectrum of isopentane after exchange with deuterated HUSY zeolite (DUSY) at 373 K showed two peaks centered at 0.9 and 1.2 ppm with relative intensities of 2.9 to 1.

From the I H and 2H NMR spectra, the amount of deuteration was estimated at 3.4%. On the other hand, no peak was observed in the 2H NMR spectra of isopentane exchanged with Amberlyst-15, at 373 K, and with amorphous silica-alumina, at 373 and 523 K. A small peak centered at 0.9 ppm could be observed in the 2H NMR spectrum, after acquiring about 320 transients, of isopentane exchanged with silica-alumina at 623 K. To study the influence of olefins and Lewis acidity a NaUSY zeolite was used. The exchange of isopentane with deuterated NaUSY at 373 K showed about 0.3% of deuteration. However, addition of 10% of 2-methyl-l-butene to the isopentane increased the deuteration 6-fold. No olefinic product was ob- served in either experiment. The 2H NMR spectrum of the recovered hydrocar- bon showed, in both experiments, two peaks centered at 0.9 and 1.2 ppm (Fig. 1), relative to exchange in methyl and methylene groups adjacent to the tertiary center, respectively. The addition of 10% of 2-methyl-l-butene to the isopentane promoted a low degree of exchange with Amberlyst-15 and silica-alumina catalysts. Apparently, the exchange is principally occurring with the olefin. The 2H NMR spectrum of the hydrocarbon collected after the exchange with Amberlyst-15 at 373 K showed peaks centered at 0.9, 1.6, 1.7 and 5.3 ppm (Fig. 2), with relative C.J.A.

The peaks at 1.6, 1.7 and 5.3 ppm were ascribed to deuterium in 2-methyl-2-butene [19] and the peak at 0.9 ppm is probably due to deuterium in the methyl ~osition of isopentane. The total amount of deuteration, estimated by 1H and H NMR analysis, was 3.7%. Gas chromatographic analysis showed isopentane as the main component and forma- tion of about 4.5 wt.-% of 2-methyl-2-butene and 1.4 wt.-% of heavy C5+ hydrocarbons. The amount of 2-methyl-l-butene accounted for just 0.8 wt.-% of the collected hydrocarbons. The 2H NMR spectrum of the hydrocarbon collected after the H-D exchange of silica-alumina with a mixture of 10% 2-methyl-l-butene in isopentane, at 373 and 523 K, also showed peaks centered at 0.9, 1.6, 1.7 and 5.3 ppm, as in the case of exchange with Amberlyst-15. At 373 K, the relative intensities were 2.8, 2.8, 2.8, 1, respectively and the amount of deuteration, estimated from the ~H and 2H spectra, was about 0.6%. At 523 K, the NMR pattern was the same and the amount of deuteration was estimated to be about 1.2%. Gas chromato- graphic analysis revealed that isopentane was the major component. At 373 K, there was about 2.8% of 2-methyl-2-butene, 0.8% of 2-methyl-l-butene and about 1.2% of heavy C5 + hydrocarbons. At 523 K, the amount of 2-methyl-2- butene and 2-methyl-l-butene observed by gas chromatography was 3.3% and 1.2%, respectively. The heavy C5 + hydrocarbons accounted for about 2% of the total collected material. 186 C.J.A. Mota et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 146 (1996) 181-192 4. Discussions 4.1. H-D exchange with USY The addition of 10% of 2-methyl-l-butene to isopentane, significantly in- creased the rate of H-D exchange with deuterated NaUSY. The ultra-stabiliza- tion process, to increase the framework molar Si/A1 ratio, is carried out treating a NH4NaY zeolite with steam at high temperatures [20]. The aluminum atoms released from the framework stay inside the cavities as extra-framework material (EFAL). It is believed that cationic and condensed aluminum species are present as EFAL, and are the main responsible for the Lewis acidity of the zeolite [21,22]. After the ultra-stabilization process, most of the Bronsted acid sites, associated with the remaining framework aluminums, are neutralized by sodium. Thus, in a NaUSY Lewis acidity predominates. Infrared analysis of adsorbed pyridine showed that, the amount of Bronsted acid sites per gram of catalyst in HUSY is about 2.5 times higher than in NaUSY, considering the same extinc- tion coefficient for the band associated with the pyridinium cation (ca. 1540 cm-1) on both zeolites. The slow exchange observed for isopentane and the fact that addition of 10% of 2-methyl-l-butene accelerates the exchange with deuterated NaUSY indicate that Lewis acidity, alone, is not responsible for activation of the alkane, and that the rate determining step is anterior to the formation of the olefin. It is interesting to note that when 2-methyl- 1-butene was added to the isopentane, although the rate of exchange increased, no olefin was detected in the products, suggesting that they were rapidly and irreversibly adsorbed, followed by reversible protonation (deuteration) to form an adsorbed carbenium ion, which, by hydride transfer, gives the deuterated alkane. In fact, CP/MAS 13C NMR analysis of the NaUSY after exchange with the mixture of 2-methyl- 1-butene and isopentane revealed the presence of olefinic hydrocarbon (100-160 ppm), probably of polymeric nature, adsorbed over the zeolite surface (Fig. 3), showing the strong tendency of olefins to be adsorbed on the zeolite surface and possibly contributing to the deactivation of the zeolite. The exchange of isopentane with DUSY, of low sodium content, showed a higher degree of deuteration, compared to exchange with deuterated NaUSY. A reliable determination of the deuterium content on both zeolites is difficult, because EFAL also present hydroxyl groups [23], and their nature is not exactly known. The EFAL hydroxyls, although do not directly exchange with the hydrocarbon, undergo hydrogen bonding with the framework hydroxyls [9], making protons very mobile inside the zeolite cage and increasing the amount of exchangeable deuteriums. As ammonium exchange of NaUSY does not signifi- cantly affect the EFAL content, it is reasonable to suppose that the amount of EFAL hydroxyls is almost the same in NaUSY and HUSY. Therefore, differ- ence in hydroxyl content and, by consequence, in deuterium content is mostly related to the amount of Bronsted acid sites, which was estimated to be 2.5 C.J.A.

The amount of hydrocarbon passed over the two catalysts were the same, but the degree of deuteration of isopentane after exchange with DUSY was about 11 times higher than the deuteration after exchange with deuterated NaUSY. This value is much higher than the difference in the amount of structural hydroxyls, indicating that Bronsted acidity is involved in the initial step of alkane activation on zeolite catalysts. Therefore, we propose that the mechanism of alkane activation on zeolites involves the polarization of the C-H bond followed by electrophilic attack and direct formation of an adsorbed carbenium ion taking place on Bronsted acid sites (Scheme 1) [24]. 4.2.

The addition of 2-methyl-1- butene promoted the exchange at 373 K, but with a different selectivity compared to exchange with USY zeolite. The peaks at 1.6 and 1.7 ppm in the 2H NMR spectra indicate that the isomerization of the 2-methyl-l-butene to 2-methyl-2-butene is the main process occurring on these catalysts (Scheme 2). The peak at 0.9 ppm in the 2H NMR spectra, associated to deuterium in methyl position of the isopentane, can be explained by a hydride transfer reaction involving the deuterated tertiary carbenium ion (Scheme 3). The peak at 5.3 ppm is possibly due to deuterium in olefinic position of the 2-methyl-2-butene, originated from a second deuteration process similar to the one showed in Scheme 2. A remarkable difference was found in the chemistry of carbenium ions and olefins adsorbed over the three catalysts. In USY zeolite, at the exchange temperature, the rates of hydride transfer and olefin protonation are greater than the rate of olefin desorption. Thus, no olefin was detected in the products, although they are believed to be intermediates in the H-D exchange process [12-14]. In silica-alumina and Amberlyst-15 catalysts the rate of olefin desorp- tion is comparable, or higher, than the rate of hydride transfer and olefin protonation. Therefore, olefin adsorption is reversible and deuterated olefins appear as the main product of H-D exchange. Considering the relative intensi- ties of the peaks at 1.6 and 1.7 ppm, relative to deuterium in 2-methyl-2-butene and of the peak at 0.9 ppm, relative to deuterium in isopentane, it is possible to estimate the hydride transfer to olefin desorption ratio (kwr/kol). In Amberlyst- 15 kHr/kol is 0.43 and in silica-alumina is 0.5. 4.3. Comparison of the catalytic behavior of USY, silica-alumina and Am- berlyst-15 Alkanes are very weak bases, normally inert to most chemical agents. Therefore, electrophilic activation of the C-H bond usually requires high acid strength, such of liquid superacids [25]. The reliable measurement of acid strength of solid acids, specially zeolites, is a difficult matter, due to diffusion D D + H--Cat Scheme 3.

Recently, Umansky and Hall reported a scale for solid acids based on the adsorption of 4-nitro-toluene and 4-nitro-fluorbenzene [26,27]. Their results pointed to an H0 around -6 for silica-alumina and around - 10 for USY, both being weaker acids than 100% H2804, which has an H0 of -12.4. Notwith- standing, H0 as low as -13.2 has already been reported for an amorphous silica-alumina catalyst [28]. Another methodology for measuring the acid strength of solid acids, based on the protonation of water molecules and observation of the NMR pattern at low temperature, has recently appeared in the literature [29-31]. Equilibrium measurement indicated that on zeolite Y only 20% of stoichiometrically adsorbed water are protonated to hydronium cations [29,30], while in the sulfonic acid resin Nation-H, a complete protonation of the adsorbed water to hydronium cations was observed [31]. The Bronsted acidity in Amberlyst-15 is associated to a proton attached to a sulfonic group (Scheme 4). Therefore, the acid character of the proton is associated to the delocalization of the electron density toward the sulfonic moiety. In zeolite and silica-alumina catalysts, the Bronsted acidity is associ- ated to a proton attached to a Si-O-A1 linkage, conceptually formed through the interaction of a silanol group with an adjacent tricoordinated aluminum (Scheme 5). Therefore, the acid character is probably related to the strength of the Si-O-A1 interaction. Besides the acid character, zeolites are good nucle- ophiles, interacting with cationic species, delocalizing the positive charge into the framework [32-35]. Thus, the measurement of the zeolite acid strength relying on the degree of charge transfer to a base, may not reflect the reactivity of the zeolite toward electrophilic reactions. Zeolites act as an acid, protonating bases, and as a solvent, delocalizing the positive charge of cations. The strength of the Si-O-A1 interaction should be higher in zeolites than in silica-alumina. Besides conferring acidity, it contributes to maintain the crystalline structure of the framework, thus explaining the higher acid strength of zeolites compared to amorphous silica-alumina. However, it cannot explain the high reactivity of zeolites toward very weak bases like alkanes. HS+ I ~.,O.. 8~ -% Scheme 5. Nature of Bronsted acidity in zeolites and silica-alumina. 190 C.J.A. Mota et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 146 (1996) 181-192 In liquid superacids, such as HSO3F/SbF5, the driving force for the remark- able reactivity to alkanes seems to be the formation of Sb2Fj0FSO3 and more associated anions, delocalizing the negative charge and reducing the nucle- ophilicity of the system [36-38]. Upon protonation of the hydrocarbon, the excess of negative charge in zeolites is mainly localized on the oxygens adjacent to the aluminum atom, thus increasing their nucleophilicity and explaining the observed tendency of zeolites to interact or solvate carbocations [32-34]. On the other hand, theoretical calculations on a large zeolite cluster, resembling the real structure of zeolite Y, showed that upon the attachment of a proton to a Si-O-A1 linkage, there occurs a stretching of the A1-O bond and a decrease of the Si-O-A1 bond angle, creating a distortion in the crystalline structure [39]. This may be the origin of the high reactivity of zeolites toward alkanes, compared to amorphous silica-alumina and Amberlyst-15 catalysts. In the latter, the nature of the acid site is different from the zeolite and the acid strength should probably be similar to the strength of sulfonic acids. In silica-alumina, although the nature of the Bronsted acid site is the same as in the zeolites, the deformations in bond length and bond angles are better accommodated by the amorphous structure, decreasing the reactivity. Scheme 6 shows a pictorial view of hydrocarbon reactions on zeolites. Upon proton transfer to the hydrocarbon (I), a relaxation of the zeolite structure occurs (II), relieving the steric strain si.O-si'O~si-O.Si.o si.O-si'O~si-O.Si.o 0 ~ 0 Si t Si Si # Si # # 0 t 0 0 t - 0 t , - } Si ~ Si , , ....

Pictorial view of hydrocarbon reactions on zeolites. C.J.A. Mota et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 146 (1996) 181-192 191 associated to the attachment of the proton. However, the excess of negative charge on the framework, mostly concentrated on the oxygens adjacent to the aluminum atom, increases the nucleophilicity and favors the interaction with the carbocation formed (III). This causes, again, a local deformation of the structure, favoring the elimination to give the olefin (IV), which may be further proto- nated, reinitiating the cycle. Acidity, as strictly defined by the equilibrium reaction between a proton donor (acid) and a proton acceptor (base), does not seem to be suitable for correlating with zeolite catalytic properties. As catalysis is a kinetic phe- nomenon and acidity a thermodynamic one, both, electrophilicity and nucle- ophilicity concepts should be used instead. In fact, the concept of superelec- trophiles has been recently invoked to explain reactivity behavior in liquid superacid solutions [40]. In zeolites the acid strength, as measured by the equilibrium of proton transfer to a base, does not appear to be high, resembling the acid strength of concentrated sulfuric acid solutions. However, the elec- trophilicity, as measured by the kinetics of H-D exchange with alkanes, is probably very high, making zeolites good catalysts for hydrocarbon reactions. Another important factor is the zeolite nucleophilicity, which seems to be involved in equilibrium acidic and kinetic electrophilic measurements. 5. Conclusions The H-D exchange of isopentane and isopentane/2-methyl-l-butene mixture with solid acid catalysts is a convenient method to study the mechanism of alkane activation and the reactivity of different catalysts. With zeolites, ex- change readily occurs at 373 K and the addition of an olefin accelerates the exchange, indicating that the rate determining step in alkane activation over zeolite is anterior to the formation of the olefin. Nevertheless, with Amberlyst-15 and silica-alumina almost no exchange with isopentane was observed. The addition of 2-methyl-l-butene promoted the exchange, but isomerization to the deuterated 2-methyl-2-butene was the main reaction, indicating that exchange has occurred with the olefin. The origin of the high reactivity of zeolites toward alkanes, compared with Amberlyst-15 and amorphous silica-alumina, is probably due to steric reasons, associated with the distortion of the crystalline structure upon the attachment of a proton in a Si-O-A1 linkage.

Fax. (+55-21) 5986626 The mechanism of activation of isopentane on USY zeolite, amorphous silica-alumina and Amberlyst-15 catalysts was studied by H-D exchange. Only the zeolite showed exchange with the isopentane at 373 K. The addition of 10% of 2-methyl-1-butene to the isopentane accelerates the exchange with USY zeolite and promotes a small exchange with amorphous silica-alumina and Amberlyst-15. Nevertheless, the selectivity was different. With USY, no olefin was detected in the products, suggesting that they were protonated (deuterated) to give the tertiary carbenium ion, which, after hydride transfer, desorbs as a deuterated isopentane molecule. CP/MAS13C NMR analysis of the zeolite after exchange showed a significant amount of adsorbed olefinic material. On the other hand, the main reaction on Amberlyst-15 and silica-alumina is the apparent isomerization of 2-methyl-1-butene to 2-methyl-2-butene. The reactivity of the zeolite for the reaction with isopentane is probably due to steric effects, associated with the distortion of the crystalline structure. These effects are absents in Amberlyst-15 and amorphous silica-alumina catalysts. Keywords Acidity Amberlyst-15 Isopropanol Silica-alumina Zeolites References [1] Scherzer J. Ritter R.E. Ind. Eng.
