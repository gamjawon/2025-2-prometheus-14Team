Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to multi-carbon product, especially for ethylene (C2H4), provides a favorable pathway for carbon neutrality and renewable energy storage. However, the second-order C-C coupling reactions in CO2RR need always the high activation/driven energy in dynamics originating from the trace C1 intermediate product. Herein, we synthesized the Ag-decorated Cu2O porous hollow core-shell catalyst named Ag@Cu2O where Ag nanoparticles uniformly distributed on inner the surface of the hollow Cu2O (H-Cu2O) via the sacrificial template method. Benefiting from the synergistic hollow structure and electron transfer from Cu and Ag to O, Ag@Cu2O catalyst delivers the excellent C2H4 Faradaic Efficiency (FE) of 55 % ± 2 % at −1.0 V (vs. RHE), which is superior to the most reported catalysts. More importantly, in situ infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the introduction of Ag can decrease the activation energy required for *CO and C-C coupling.

Consequently, the effective reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere represents a pressing global issue. The electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 presents a promising and sustainable solution to this issue [1–4]. Employing renewable electricity for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction addresses environmental challenges while simultaneously transforming CO2 into valuable chemical feedstocks, thereby alleviating energy scarcity [5,6]. In electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), the product composition is notably intricate, including carbon monoxide (CO) [7], methane (CH4) [8,9], formic acid (HCOOH) [10], ethylene (C2H4) [11–18], ethanol (C2H5OH) [19,20], n-propanol (C3H7OH) [21,22]. Among the products, C2H4 is a priority target with high market value and has been widely studied in the chemical industry [23]. However, due to the slow kinetics of C-C coupling reaction, the high selectivity of CO2RR to generate C2H4 remains a great challenge [24]. Noticeably, Cu-based catalysts exhibit a unique ability to drive C-C coupling to produce C2H4 in CO2RR [25]. CO related intermediate, adsorbed CO (*CO), is a raw material for C-C coupling and an important intermediate for CO2RR to produce C2H4. Therefore, promoting the production and timely capture of *CO through the design of catalyst structures has attracted great attentions. Accordingly, the Cu-based catalysts with a hollow structure have been designed to enrich *CO in a given region, and this structure has been used to limit the loss of *CO and promotes the C-C coupling process [26–30]. For instance, Yang's group used prepared multicavity Cu2O catalyst, which can retain the Cu+ species and enrich *CO, resulting in the high C2/C1 ratio [27]. Chun reported when there are more cavitary shells, the C1 intermediate is more likely to undergo a C-C coupling process, which has a longer diffusion path, and a stronger resistance to the outward diffusion of carbon species intermediates to improve selectivity for C2 products [28]. To sum up, the hollow structure will significantly limit the transfer of C1 species, resulting in local enrichment of C1 intermediates in the cavity, which is conducive to the production of C2 products. However, the reported Cu-based hollow catalysts are unable to generate *CO with high efficiency, leading to inadequate *CO supply for the C-C coupling process. Introducing some additional components, such as nickel [31], zinc [32,33], aurum [34–36] and silver [37–41], into Cu-based catalysts can effectively improve the production of *CO. Among them, Ag has a remarkable inhibitory effect on hydrogen evolution reactions (HER), which have combined with copper-based catalysts have received widespread attention [42–44]. Hence, the Cu-Ag composite catalysts with a hollow structure hold very promising prospects in the CO2RR, which have been few reported in the literatures. In this work, Ag@Cu2O catalysts with a hollow structure have been synthesized by the sacrificial template method. Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) with the diameter of about 4 nm are uniform distributed on the inner surface of porous Cu2O. Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) results show that Ag NPs have the stronger ability to generate significant amounts of *CO with lower energy, which can be enriched in the inner cavity of Ag@Cu2O. Upon *CO reaching the active site of Cu2O, it is easy to form C-C bonds because of the lower energy barrier, contributing to the achievement of notable selectivity towards C2H4. Therefore, the C2H4 Faradaic Efficiency (FE) of Ag@Cu2O reaches 55 % ± 2 % with a bias current density of 11.0 mA cm−2, which is 1.8 times higher than that of hollow pure Cu2O (H-Cu2O, 31 %). 2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials and reagents Copper nitrate (Cu(NO3)2.·3 H2O), sophorolipid (SL), silver nitrate (AgNO3), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), ascorbic acid (AA), ammonium hydroxide (NH3·3 H2O, 14 mol L−1), sodium borohydride (NaBH4) were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. Styrene (C8H8), acrylic acid (C3H4O2), ammonium persulfate (KPS), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), methyl methacrylate (C5H8O2), ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3), N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF), potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3) and isopropyl alcohol (C3H8O) were purchased from Aladdin. Nafion D-520 dispersion (5 % w/w in a mixture of lower aliphatic alcohols and water) was purchased from du Pont Company. All chemicals are commercially available and used directly without further treatment. Deionized water (18.25 MΩ cm−1) was employed to prepare all aqueous solutions in this work. 2.2 Catalyst preparation 2.2.1 Synthesis of polystyrene spheres (PS, 150 nm) 14.45 mL styrene, 1.27 mL acrylic acid, 1.5 mL methyl methacrylate, 0.67 g NH4HCO3, 0.1 g KPS and 0.1 g SDS were added into 50 mL deionized water under stirring. After 20 min, 14.45 mL styrene and 50 mL water were subsequently added. After that, the above solution was reacted under the nitrogen atmosphere at 85 °C. The monomers were polymerized for 11 h and milky white suspension products were obtained. The above suspension was washed three times with water to remove unreacted raw materials and modifiers. The wet solid was collected by centrifuging, which was transferred to water to form a dispersion. 2.2.2 Synthesis of Ag@Cu2O Firstly, 1 mmol AgNO3 was dissolved in the 100 mL water. Next, slowly adding ammonia in AgNO3 solution until it was colorless and transparent. 0.3 mL of PS suspension and 108 mg SL were added to the above solution and stirred for 30 min. Then, 50 mL (0.03 M) of NaBH4 solution was slowly added to the above solution. Transferred the product to a beaker and aged for 30 min. Finally, the product named PS@Ag was centrifuged, washed three times with ethanol and dried in vacuum for 24 h at 60 °C. Then, 1 mmol Cu(NO3)2·3 H2O and 0.56 mL ammonia were dissolved in 20 mL water (called A), 10 mg PS@Ag were dissolved in 10 mL ethanol (called B) and sonicated for 30 min. Subsequently, Poured B into A and stirred for 30 min. Next, quickly added 4 mL of 1.0 M AA solution and kept reacting for 1 h. Finally, the product was centrifuged and dried after the precursor was entirely reduced. The dried product was dissolved in DMF to remove the PS and washed three times with water. The obtained sediment was dried in vacuum for 24 h at 60 °C for further experiment and characterization. 2.2.3 Synthesis of H-Cu2O, Cu2O and loaded on Cu2O (Ag/Cu2O) The experiment synthesis of H-Cu2O and Cu2O were the same as that of Ag@Cu2O, except that PS@Ag was replaced by PS and not adding, respectively; The experiment synthesis of Ag/Cu2O was that 1 mmol H-Cu2O was dissolved in 30 mL water, dropped 1 M 0.07 mL AgNO3 solution in it slowly kept reacting for 1 h. Finally, the product was centrifuged and dried after the precursor was entirely reduced. 2.3 Catalyst characterization The phase identification and crystal structure were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, X’Pert Pro diffractometer) with Cu Kα radiation. The surface compositions and chemical states were collected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fisher Scientific Escalab 250Xi). The deconvolution and fitting of Cu LMM Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) spectra were obtained by Advantage software. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM, JSM-7800F) and transmission electronic microscopy (TEM, HT7700) were used to characterize structure and surface morphology of samples. The surface lattice of Ag@Cu2O were revealed by high resolution-TEM (HRTEM, H-9500). Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was performed on Agilent 7700X. N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were recorded on an ASAP P2460 accelerated surface area and a porosimetry instrument, equipped with an automated surface area, at 77 K by using Barrett−Emmett−Teller calculations. 2.4 Catalyst test To prepare the electrodes for H-type cell, the working electrodes were prepared by loading catalysts suspension onto Toray Caborn fiber paper (TGP-H-60), a certain amount of catalyst (1.0 mg) was dispersed in 5 μL Nafion dispersion in the mixture of water (100 μL) and isopropanol (100 μL) for 1 h to form homogeneous suspension. The suspension was loaded on working electrode with an area of 1.0 × 1.0 cm and dried. After drying, the working electrode was ready to use in H-cell for CO2RR. The electrochemical CO2RR performance of these catalysts were evaluted by chronoamperometry in a gas-tight H-cell (Figure S1) with CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte at an applied potential of −0.9 to −1.1 V vs. RHE. Before CO2RR, 0.1 M KHCO3 solution was used as electrolyte solution and catholyte were bubbled with CO2 for 30 min to reach saturation. The gaseous and liquid products were measured quantitatively by gas chromatography and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy, respectively. This study primarily focused on the content of gas products, with a relatively lower proportion of liquid products. All potentials in this study were IR-corrected for H-cell unless specified and measured against the Ag/AgCl reference electrode (in 3 M KCl solution) and converted to the RHE reference scale by E vs . RHE = E ( vs . Ag / AgCl ) + 0.197 + 0.0592 × pH The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was carried out from 0 V to −1.2 V vs. RHE in CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 or Ar-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 to evaluate the activity of CO2RR. The double layer capacitance (Cdl) was calculated different sample according to cycle voltammetry (CV) ranging from 20 to 120 s - 1 and then the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) was calculated. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was carried out from 100000 to 0.1 Hz with an amplitude of 10 mV. The stability test was carried out in the CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 at 1.0 V for 9 h during the stability test. The gas products were detected by online gas chromatography (GC-2014C) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and two flame ionization detectors (FID1, FID2). The quantification analysis of gases adopts the external standard method. Under the control of a mass flow controller, the standard mixture of H2, CO, CH4 and C2H4 with a determined concentration gradient are directly introduced into GC. According to gas samples based on the peak areas and gas concentrations of different products, chromatography detection allows for the determined of standard curves. High purity argon (Ar) gases were used as the carrier gas. The outlet gas stream was injected into GC after CO2 electrocatalysis for 10 min at each potential. The liquid products were detected and quantified by 400 MHz 1HMR spectrometer. The liquid products were calculated referred to the concentration of internal standard based on ratio of NMR peak integral area to internal standard area and calibration curves. Subsequently, to prepare the NMR samples, 500 μL of the freshy collected electrolyte was mixed with 100 μL D6OS (99.9 %). The faradaic efficiency (FE) is the main parameters used to evaluate the CO2RR selectivity of catalyst. The gas and liquid products were calculated by the following formula FE = Q product / Q total = nZF / Q total = nZF / it Where n is the transfer number for a specific product for each sampling time, Z is the transfer number of electrons to generate 1 mol of product, F is Faraday constant, i is the current at cathodic pulse, t is running time for a cathodic pulse. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis and characterizations of the catalysts The process for synthesizing Ag@Cu2O is illustrated in Fig. 1 a. Figs. 1 b- 1 i correspond to the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of PS, PS@Ag, PS@Ag@Cu2O, Ag@Cu2O in the process flow diagram respectively. Ag@Cu2O is used to craft by the sacrificial template and wet reduction method [45]. Firstly, PS sphere as a sacrificial template is synthesized by the emulsion polymerization method, which has a diameter of about 150 nm with smooth surface as depicted in Figs. 1 b and 1 f. Then, Ag is uniformly distributed on the surface of PS under the action of reducing agents and the overall particle size of the catalysts is increased by about 10 nm (Figs. 1 c and 1 g). Subsequently, [Cu(NH3)4]2+ absorbs on the surfaces of PS@Ag due to electrostatic interaction. The introduction of ascorbic acid induces [Cu(NH3)4]2+ to facilitate the development of a core-shell type nanocomposite with PS@Ag as the core and Cu2O as the shell called PS@Ag@Cu2O. It is worth nothing that the surface of Cu2O is very rough. At this point, the overall size of the catalyst is approximately 210 nm (Figs. 1 d and 1 h). Finally, removal of the PS results in the formation of the product Ag@Cu2O. As shown in Figs. 1 e and 1 i, the Ag@Cu2O does not collapse with a hollow structure inside, and the particle size is similar to that without removing the template. And the part of the dashed box in Fig. 1 i shows a broken shell Ag@Cu2O, which reveals that the interior is hollow, corresponding structure to Fig. 1 e. Fig. 2 a is the TEM image of PS@Ag, which shows Ag NPs uniformly distributed on the surface of the PS sphere, and the average particle size of Ag NPs is about 4 nm (inset in Fig. 2 a). Furthermore, the high-angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF STEM) and the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping results of PS@Ag shows that Ag NPs are spread on the surface of the PS sphere (Figure S2). Fig. 2 b illustrates a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) image of PS@Ag with a lattice spacing of 0.240 nm, which corresponds to the crystal plane of Ag (111) and further proves the successful loading of Ag NPs on the PS surface. Ag@Cu2O with a diameter of 210 nm and a wall thickness of 30 nm is obtained after the template PS sphere is removed by DMF (Fig. 2 c). And a TGA test is conducted on Ag@Cu2O. 450 °C has exceeded the decomposition temperature of PS and the result shows that its weight loss rate from 35 to 500 °C was less than 4 % (Figure S3) [46]. Therefore, PS has been completely removed by DMF during the process of PS@Ag@Cu2O turning into Ag@Cu2O. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area for Ag@Cu2O is determined to be 22.7 m3/g and the pore size is 10–20 nm (Fig. 2 d). In addition, the distinct stripes can be clearly observed from the HR-TEM map of Ag@Cu2O (Fig. 2 e), where the lattice spacing is 0.249 nm and 0.217 nm, corresponding to the (111) and (200) crystal planes of Cu2O, respectively. Fig. 2 f is HAADF STEM and EDS elemental mapping images of Ag@Cu2O. The results show that Ag NPs exist in the interior of the Ag@Cu2O hollow core-shell structure. The thickness of the Ag NPs layer is about 4 nm, which is consistent with the particle size of the Ag NPs, indicating the monolayer distribution of Ag NPs. The thickness of the Cu2O layer is about 26 nm. In addition, EDS data shows that the peak positions of Cu and O elements are the same, and the peak position of Ag is on the inner side of Cu EDS data shows that the peak positions of Cu and O elements are the same, and the peak position of Ag is on the inner side of Cu EDS data and reveals the peak positions of Cu and O elements are the same, and the peak position of Ag spreads in the inner side of Cu, which are consistent with the HAADF STEM and EDS results (Figure S4). Besides, in order to access Ag@Cu2O effects of the hollow and Ag introduction, we also prepare a catalyst for comparison. The morphologies of H-Cu2O, Ag/Cu2O and Cu2O are characterized, and the TEM results are shown in Figure S5a-S5c. The morphologies and sizes of H-Cu2O and Ag/Cu2O are similar to the Ag@Cu2O. It is worth noting that the morphology of Cu2O prepared without the PS template is a solid porous cube with a diameter of about 150 nm. The structure of the catalyst is characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 3 a represents the XRD patterns of Ag@Cu2O, PS@Ag@Cu2O, H-Cu2O and Ag/Cu2O. The diffraction peaks of H-Cu2O and Cu2O at 29.63°, 36.50°, 42.40°, 61.52° and 73.70° correspond to the (110), (111), (200), (220) and (311) crystal planes of Cu2O (PDF#65–3288) [47,48], respectively. In addition, there are additional diffraction peaks at 38.14°, 44.30°, 64.44° and 77.40° in the XRD patterns of Ag@Cu2O, PS@Ag@Cu2O and Ag/Cu2O, which correspond to the (111), (200), (220) and (311) crystal planes of Ag (PDF#87–0597) [49,50]. The content of Ag in Ag@Cu2O is determined as 6.0 wt% by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) in Table S1. Subsequently, characterization of the surface compositions and chemical states of Ag@Cu2O are conducted by XPS. Fig. 3 b shows the full spectrum of XPS for Ag@Cu2O, resulting in the presence of Cu, Ag, and O elements. Fig. 3 c is the XPS spectra of Cu 2p which detects Cu2+ (with peaks at 934.51 and 953.86 eV) and Cu+ (with peaks at 932.40 and 952.07 eV) in the catalyst [51–53]. The presence of Cu2+ can be attributed to the catalyst being oxidized by immersion in air. In addition, the Cu LMM auger peak is measured to be 570.1 eV through auger electron spectroscopy (AES), which proves that the main valence state of Cu in the catalyst is Cu1+ (Fig. 3 d) [54]. The Ag species is confirmed by Ag0 (the peak positions of 368.14 and 374.14 eV) in Ag 3d XPS spectra (Fig. 3 e) [55], Nevertheless, the O 1 s peak position is approximately 531.38 eV (Fig. 3 f) [56]. In comparison to Ag@Cu2O, Cu2O, and Ag, the Cu 2p and Ag 3d XPS peaks of Ag@Cu2O exhibit a shift towards higher binding energy. Nevertheless, the O 1 s peak experiences a displacement towards lower binding energy. In addition, Raman spectroscopy (Figure S6) demonstrates that the introduction of Ag does affect the form of Cu2O in the catalyst. Compared to Cu2O, Ag-O is observed in both Ag@Cu2O and Ag/Cu2O at 342 and 445 cm−1 [57], indicating the presence of a small amount of Ag-O on the contact surface between Ag and Cu2O in the catalyst. This scenario may be attributed to the contact surfaces and robust interactions between Cu and Ag, which facilitates the passage of electrons from Cu and Ag to the lattice oxygen of Cu2O [58]. Moreover, this may result in the surface migration of *CO produced by Ag to Cu2O surface, and be benefit to subsequent C-C coupling process. 3.2 Electrocatalytic Performances of Ag@Cu2O CO2RR activity of the synthesized catalysts is investigated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) analyses. The data are shown in Figure S7, it can be seen that all catalysts exhibit greater current density in CO2- compared to in Ar-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 aqueous solution. This suggests that CO2RR activity is more advantageous than HER [59]. In addition, compared to PS@Ag@Cu2O, H-Cu2O, Ag/Cu2O, and Cu2O catalyst, Ag@Cu2O possesses the greatest CO2RR activity, which is evident from the highest current density ( Fig. 4 a). In order to assess the selectivity of CO2RR, a set of chronoamperometry experiments are performed on all catalysts in CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte. The primary products of these catalysts, as depicted in Fig. 4 b and Figure S8, are H2, CO, C2H4, and a minor quantity of CH4. Moreover, Ag@Cu2O has a greater selectivity for C2H4 (Fig. 4 c). The FEC2H4 for Ag@Cu2O achieves 55 % ± 2 % at −1.0 V vs. RHE, which is much more than that of PS@Ag@Cu2O (40 %). A broad potential range is observed, with FEC2H4 exceeding 48 % at −0.9 to −1.1 V vs. RHE. Compared to PS@Ag@Cu2O, Ag@Cu2O holds lower FECO and higher FEC2H4 (Figure S9). A greater amount of CO is transformed into C2H4, which implies the existence of hollow structure can enhance the conversion rate of C2H4. This is attributed to the fact that after removal the PS template, CO produced will accumulate inside the hollow and increase the possibility of C-C coupling. Based on the results of introducing hollow to improve C2H4 selectivity, we further explore whether the addition of Ag element affects the selectivity of the product. As shown in Fig. 4 c, the FEC2H4 for Ag@Cu2O is an 80 % improvement compared to H-Cu2O (31 %) (Fig S10). Moreover, Ag@Cu2O catalyst exhibits a lower FE of H2 and CO because Ag can efficiently inhibit HER and produce more CO, meanwhile the produced CO is reduced to C2H4 by Cu2O due to the storage effect of cavity (Fig S11). This conclusion is also consistent with the peak shift of the element in XPS. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to C2H4 is a tandem reaction. In order to access the influence of the position of Ag on product selectivity, Ag@Cu2O and Ag/Cu2O are prepared and their FE of C2H4 and CO are tested. Throughout the tested voltage range, as shown in Fig. 4 c, FEC2H4 of Ag@Cu2O is greater than that of Ag/Cu2O. Nevertheless, FECO of Ag/Cu2O is far more than that of Ag@Cu2O, almost 70 % higher at −1.0 V vs. RHE (Figure S12). It is indicated that Ag/Cu2O catalyst has a high CO yield and a low C2H4 yield. The main reason may be that when Ag is loaded on the outer surface of Cu2O, a portion of the CO produced by Ag in close proximity to Cu2O will engage in the C-C coupling process. However, the majority of the CO located at a distance from Cu2O will be released from the system (Figure S13a). On the contrary, the presence of Ag on the inner surface of Cu2O leads to the enrichment of CO produced by its catalysis within the cavity, this enrichment results in an elevation of the concentration of CO inside the hollow structure, thereby enhancing the likelihood of C-C coupling process [60]. Moreover, Figure S13b is the overpotential required for the same C2H4 current density, Ag@Cu2O has a lower overpotential at the same C2H4 current density. This proves Ag@Cu2O only lower energy is needed to achieve the same electrochemical activity as Ag/Cu2O, which also indicates that Ag@Cu2O activity is better than Ag/Cu2O. The stability of catalysts is assessed by long-term chronoamperometry experiments conducted in a CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte at −1.0 V vs RHE and the results are shown in Fig. 4 d. Ag@Cu2O exhibits the great stability with no notable decrease in FEC2H4 and current density subsequent to 16 hours of electrolysis. For the H-Cu2O, FEC2H4 sharply drops after 3.7 hours of CO2RR (Figure S14). Meanwhile, SEM of Ag@Cu2O and the H-Cu2O are employed to exhibit the structure changes (Figure S15). Following stability testing, there is no obvious changes in the structure of Ag@Cu2O, and no Ag element is found in the electrolyte after stability testing (Figure S15a and S15c). However, the architecture of H-Cu2O experienced substantial alterations. The structure of H-Cu2O collapses and the overall sphericity of the catalyst is disrupted after stability testing (Figure S15b and S15d). And XRD of Ag@Cu2O and H-Cu2O before and after electrolysis experiments is analyzed (Figure S16), and the result shows that the crystal form of Cu2O in Ag@Cu2O in the electrolyte remains unchanged (Due to the catalyst being coated on carbon paper in an amount of 1 mg/cm2, Ag@Cu2O The amount of Ag in the sample is too small to detect in XRD), while only the diffraction peaks of Cu (PDF#70–3038) appeared on the XRD pattern of H-Cu2O after electrolysis, indicating that H-Cu2O had undergone metamorphism at this time. This phenomenon can be attributed to the displacement of electron clouds in Ag and Cu, resulting in Ag partially stabilizing Cu2O and enhancing the overall stability of the catalyst [61]. Furthermore, comparing the double-layer capacitance (Cdl), electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of the aforementioned catalysts, the Cdl values for Ag@Cu2O, PS@Ag@Cu2O, H-Cu2O, Ag/Cu2O and Cu2O are determined to be 6.94, 2.49, 1.55, 5.54 and 1.33 mF cm−2 respectively in Figure S17-S18, which demonstrate that Ag@Cu2O holds a highest number of active sites under unit mass. An analysis of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) reveals that the Ag@Cu2O has a lower charge-transfer resistance (Rct), indicating a rapid reaction rate (Figure S19) [62]. Finally, we prepare a hollow core-shell catalyst Ag@Cu2O with FEC2H4 of 55 % ± 2 % at −1.0 V vs. RHE, which surpass that of most previously reported catalysts (Fig. 4 e). 3.3 Mechanism of Electrocatalytic CO2RR The evolution of transmitted reaction intermediates from −0.6 V to −1.6 V vs. RHE in CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte is monitored using in situ infrared spectroscopy for a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanism behind the synthesis pathway of C2H4. Figs. 4 f and 4 g are the in situ infrared spectroscopy graphics of Ag@Cu2O and H-Cu2O respectively. An absorption vibration peak of H2O is detected at 1650 cm−1 [63], and the intensity of this peak rises with the increase of voltage,suggesting that H2O is adsorbed and activated on the catalyst to generate *Had. Besides, it provides proton source for the hydrogenation process of CO2RR. The *CO and *COOH signals locate at 2068 and 1396 cm−1 respectively [64]. For Ag@Cu2O, the two signals exist at −0.7 V (vs. RHE), with the stronger peaks stronger than those of H-Cu2O. This is mainly attributed to the more efficient adsorption of CO2 by Ag in Ag@Cu2O to form the *COOH, after protonation and dehydration to generate *CO (*CO2→*COOH→*CO). Noticeably, An evident absorption peak at 1543 cm−1 in the in situ infrared spectroscopy graphic of Ag@Cu2O and H-Cu2O corresponds to the adsorption of *OCCO [65]. The increase in absorption peak of *OCCO intensity with increasing potentials indicates an acceleration in the production rate of C2H4. The *OCCO absorption peak of Ag@Cu2O is clearly more pronounced than that of H-Cu2O, suggesting that the adsorption of *OCCO by Ag@Cu2O is more stable. Furthermore, this result confirms that CO generated by Ag can be enriched inside the hollow Cu2O, which can increase the possibility of C-C coupling. Summarizing, the findings of in situ FTIR suggest that Ag has a high capacity for CO2 adsorption and a substantial quantity of *CO can be generated. The *CO subsequently is enriched and reacted at the active sites of Cu2O, enhancing C-C coupling mechanism and resulting in the formation of C2H4, and the whole process is shown in Fig. 5 a. DFT was employed to further understand the catalystic mechanism of Ag@Cu2O. Based on the HRTEM images and in situ FTIR specroscopy, the Cu2O (111) and Ag (111) crystallographic planes are built for modeling. The distinction between Ag@Cu2O and H-Cu2O catalysts can be made by whether Ag4 clusters are placed on the Cu2O (111) slab, as depicted in Fig. 5 b and Figure S20 -21. First at all, the generation of *COOH has a high thermodynamic energy barrier (-0.20 eV) in Ag@Cu2O catalyst, but it exhibits lower adsorption energy (-0.37 eV) in the generation and desorption of *CO than H-Cu2O (-0.98 eV) (Figure S22 -23). Moreover, the adsorption energy of Ag@Cu2O (0.75 eV) is much lower than H-Cu2O (1.02 eV) in forming 2*CO process, which is rate-determining step. Therefore, 2*CO only requires lower desorption energy to easily stabilize, transfer and finish the subsequent C-C coupling process (Figure S24 -25). In addition, dimerization (2*CO→*OCCO) is a crucial step in the formation of C2H4. As shown in Fig. 5 c, the reaction Gibbs free energy of C-C coupling process for the Ag@Cu2O is 0.50 eV, close to H-Cu2O (0.53 eV), which is difficult to distinguish between the two catalysts in the C-C step (Figure S24 -25). The DFT results are consistent with the experimental and in situ FTIR results mentioned above, and also demonstrates Ag@Cu2O has advantages in *CO generation and C-C coupling at the theoretical level. 4 Conclusion In summary, we have successfully designed and synthesized the porous hollow core-shell Ag@Cu2O catalyst, which exhibits excellent performance in both activity and selectivity towards C2H4, and FEC2H4 reaches 55 % ± 2 % at −1.0 V vs. RHE with a bias current density of 11.0 mA cm−2. In situ infrared spectroscopy and DFT data verify main generation of CO at Ag NPs and reaction pathway of C-C coupling. Experimental results have shown that when Ag NPs are present on the inner surface of hollow Cu2O. The impact of Ag on the crystal structure of Cu2O results in a shift of electrons from both Ag and Cu towards O. The CO generated by Ag NPs can be enriched in central cavity and facilitate subsequent C-C coupling. This work enhances the C-C coupling process by structural design and enrichment of reaction intermediates, providing a structurally guided approach for the efficient production of C2H4.

        "dc:description": "Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to multi-carbon product, especially for ethylene (C2H4), provides a favorable pathway for carbon neutrality and renewable energy storage. However, the second-order C-C coupling reactions in CO2RR need always the high activation/driven energy in dynamics originating from the trace C1 intermediate product. Herein, we synthesized the Ag-decorated Cu2O porous hollow core-shell catalyst named Ag@Cu2O where Ag nanoparticles uniformly distributed on inner the surface of the hollow Cu2O (H-Cu2O) via the sacrificial template method. Benefiting from the synergistic hollow structure and electron transfer from Cu and Ag to O, Ag@Cu2O catalyst delivers the excellent C2H4 Faradaic Efficiency (FE) of 55 % ± 2 % at −1.0 V (vs. RHE), which is superior to the most reported catalysts. More importantly, in situ infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the introduction of Ag can decrease the activation energy required for *CO and C-C coupling.",
