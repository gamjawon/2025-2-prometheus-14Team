The allylsilanes crossmetathesis with some vinylsilanes and 1-alkenes has been found to proceed likewise. Key words: allyl derivatives; metathesis; ruthenium; silanes 1. Introduction The present state of metathesis of silicon-containing olefins has been summarized in recent reviews [ 1,2] . There are only a few reports on the self-metathesis of allylsubstituted silanes. Molybdenum and tungsten based systems, the classical metathesis catalysts, show rather low activity in the presence of silicon containing olefins. Finkelshtein at al. reported good metathetical activity of the Re207/AI201/SnR, system for intra-metathesis and metathetical polymerization of diallyl-substituted silanes [3] and disilanes [4]. We found that activation of RuC12(PPh3)3 in benzene makes the catalytic system very effective in metathesis and cross-metathesis of a series of vinyl-substituted silanes (with Me, OR and Ph substituents) [ 5 ] . However, at the beginning of our investigation on metathesis of silicon-containing olefins, we observed that replacement of vinyl by allyl substituents in alkenylsilanes decreases markedly both the activity of the RuC12(PPh3)3 complex and the yield of metathesis [6] . In this paper we present the untypical behaviour of ruthenium complexes in the metathetical conversion of allylsilanes. *Corresponding author.

Marciniec et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 90 (1994) 125-133 2. Results and discussion The self-metathesis of allylsilanes catalyzed by rhenium oxide catalyst [ 3 ] occur according to the following equation (Eq. 1) CH2=CHCH2SiR3 R3SiCH2CH=CHCH2SiR3 [Re[ CH2=CHCH2SM3 CH2=CH2 The reaction carried out at 120 C in the presence of ruthenium complex e.g. RUC12 (PPh3) 3 dissolved in benzene proceeds in a different way. The GC analysis of liquid products obtained in the reaction with participation of allyltriethoxysilane shows 12.9% yield of the product. This substance, after separation from the reaction mixture, was analysed by GC/ MS, `H and `3C NMR methods which showed that it contains only three carbon atoms between the two silyl groups. Upon analysis of gaseous product, propene was detected instead of ethylene ensuing from the Eq. 1. Additionally, the analysis of substrate left after the reaction indicated that allyltriethoxysilane was almost completely isomerized to 1propenyltriethoxysilane. This can be explained by the fact that vinylsilanes are more stable (ca. 8 kJ /mol) than their allyl isomers [ 7 ] . Matsuda reported that allyltrimethylsilane was readily contaminated by isomerized product, 1-propenyltrimethylsilane, at 100 C in the presence of catalytic amount of RhH (PPh3) 4, RuH (Cl) (CO) (PPh3) 4 or RuH2 (PPh3) 4 [ 8 ] . The last ruthenium hydride complex has been known to cause isomedzation of allylic trimethylsilyl ethers to vinylic ethers [9,10] . Formation of the detected propene and 1,3-bis(triethoxysilyl)propene can be explained as follows: during the processes of isomerization and metathesis, the left allyltriethoxysilane reacts with their isomerized form, 1-propenyltriethoxysilane, resulting in formation of the observed products (Eq. 2): CH2=CHCHZSi(OE03 CH3CH=CHSi(OEt)3 (Et0)3SiCH=CHCH2Si(OEt)3 [Ru] + + (2) CH2=CHCH2Si(OEt)3 CH3CH=CH2 Having allyltriethoxysilane isomerized to propenyltriethoxysilane, one would expect quite different products of metathesis than those obtained, i.e. 2-butene and 1,2 bis(triethoxysilyl)ethene according to the following equation (Eq. 3): CH3CH=CHSi(OEt)3 (Et0)3SiCH=CHSi(OEt)3 + -X-4 + (3) CH3CH=CHSi(OE03 CH3CH=CHCH3 However, none of them is observed. In a separate experiment, pure I-propenyltriethoxysilane [ 11 ] heated (110 C, 24 h) in the presence of benzene solution of RUCIZ(PPh3)3 gave exclusively the product of 1,3bis(triethoxysilyl)propene, instead of the expected 1,2-bis(triethoxysilyl)ethene (Eq. 3). This indicates, that in the catalytic cycle reversible formation of allylsilane occurs. B.

Also, in the case of allyltrimethylsilane, isomerization to 1-propenyltrimethylsilane was observed, followed by their cross-metathesis with allyltrimethylsilane resulting in 1,3-bis(trimethylsilyl)propene (Eq. 4). Relevant synthetic and spectroscopic data are given in Experimental. CH3CH=CHSiMe3 Me3SiCH=CHCH2SiMe3 + + (4) CHZ=CHCH2SiMe3 Me3SiCHZCH=CHCHZSiMe3 Several ruthenium complexes have been investigated as catalyst of allylsilane metathesis. Selected experimental data are compiled in Tables 1 and 2. Under the reaction conditions used (130 C, 48 h), a yield 15-14% of 1,3-bis(triethoxysilyl)propene and 8-40% of 1,3bis(trimethylsilyl)propene can result, accompanied by tetraethoxysilane (10-20%) and other by-products. The most active catalyst appeared to be [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 in both cases, i.e. of allyltriethoxy- as well as allyltrimethylsilane. The reaction is not stereoselective and two isomers are formed, however, the E/Z ratio is high and equal to 9 : 1 for allyltriethoxysilane and 1 : 1 to 17:1 for allyltrimethylsilane. Addition of carbene initiator NZ=CHSiMe3 or hydride donor (HSiEt3) practically had no effect on the reaction yield in the case of allyltriethoxysilane. However, as to the less metathetically susceptible allyltrimethylsilanes, the co-catalysts lead to a very significant increase of the reaction yield and to the improvement of their stereoselectivity (E/Z doubled in a few cases). In the case of allyltrimethylsilane products of their self-metathesis i.e. 1,4-bis(trimethylsilyl)-2-butene, also were formed (1-8%). This product is not observed in the case of allyltriethoxysilane metathesis. A study was extended on cross-metathesis of allylsilanes with 1-alkenes. The reaction occurs according to the following equation (Eq. 5a): CH2=CHCH3SiR3 --> CH3CH=CHSiR3 CH3(CHZ)7CH=CHSiR3 + -- + (5a) CHZ=CH(CH2)7CH3 CH3CH=CHZ Also, in the case of the cross-metathesis reaction, allylsilanes first undergo isomerization to propenylsilane followed by the cross-metathesis with 1-decene resulting in 1-(triethoxysilyl)-1-decene (30% yield). Theoretically one can expect 1-(triethoxysilyl)-2-undecene as a product of the reaction examined (Eq. 5b): CHZ=CHCH2SiR3 CH3(CHZ)7CH=CHCHZSiR3 + -X-a + (5b) CH2=CH(CH2)7CH3 CH2=CHZ When allyltriethoxy- and allyltrimethylsilanes are together cometathesized, (Eq. 6) 1(trimethylsilyl)-2-(triethoxysilyl)ethene (I) and 1,3-bis(triethoxysilyl)propene (11) were formed in the ratio 9 : 1. CH2=CHCH2Si(OE03 Me3SiCH=CHSi(OE03 (1) + + (6) CH2=CHCH2SiMe3 (Et0)3SiCH=CHCH2Si(OE03 (lI) Product I was previously [ 12 ] obtained in the cross-metathesis reaction of vinyltriethoxy- B. Marciniec et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 90 (1994) 125-133 129 and vinyltrimethylsilane. It was also obtained in the reaction of vinyltrimethylsilane with allyltriethoxysilane (Eq. 7 ) CH2=CHCH2Si(OE03 Me3SiCH=CHSi(OE03 CHZ=CHSiMe3 CHZ=CHSi(OE03 In the reaction equilibrium two other products were additionally observed. Formation of vinyltriethoxysilane may be explained as a head-to-tail molecule orientation in the reaction intermediate complex. In the case of allyltrietoxysilane cross-metathesis with vinyldimethylethoxysilane (Eq. 8), CHZ='HCH2Si(OE03 (Et0)3SiCH=CHSi(OEt)3 (1) (Et0)3SiCH=CHSiMe2(OEt) (1I) (8) CH2=CHSiMe2(OEt) (Et0)MeZSiCH=CHSiMe2(OEt) (111) three products were formed, two of them (I) and (II) provide the evidence of propenylsilane formation prior to cross-metathesis. Heating (70-130 C, 24 h) of allyloxysilanes in the presence of ruthenium complexes leads to a very high conversion of the substrates. However, the obtained products are oligomers. No ethylene was evolved, which means that non-metathetical polymerization occurs. Further experiments, to optimise conditions, for example lowering the temperatures, variation in the concentration of substrates and a suitable catalytic system, should markedly improve the yield and selectivity of the metathesis products. 3. Experimental 3.1. Materials The allyltrimethylsilane, vinyltrimethylsilane, vinyldimethylethoxysilane and allyltriethoxysilane were purchased from Fluka AG and were used as received. 1propenyltriethoxysilane was obtained by cross-metathesis of vinyltriethoxysilane with 1propene catalyzed by RuClZ(PPh3)3 [11]. 1-decene was from Loba Chemie (Vienna). Benzene was dried on molecular sieves. RuC12(PPh3)3 was prepared by a standard procedure. 3.2. Measurements GC analyses were carried out on a Chromatron GChF 18.3 chromatograph equipped with a PC for data collection and treatment. TCD was the detector and a 3 m steel column packed with 10% SE-30 on Chromosorb P (programmed temperature rise 6 C/min, He as carrier gas). 130 B. Marciniec et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 90 (1994) 125-133 'H and '3C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Gemini 300 MHz spectrometer. Mass spectra were obtained with a Finnigan MAT ITD 800 GC/MS spectrometer. 3.3. Metathesis reactions The reactions were carried out in Supelco vials. All manipulations were performed in air and no solvent was used. 3.4. Allyltriethoxysilane metathesis The catalyst [Ru] complex (2.1 X 10-5 mol) was dissolved in 0.5 ml dried benzene and then 1.10 ml (5 X 10-3 mol) of allyltriethoxysilane was added to the catalyst solution. The vials were tightly closed and the reaction mixture was heated at 120 C for 48 h. After that time liquid products were purified from catalyst using column chromatography (aminomodified silica gel MN-60) and isolated by vacuum distillation.

The vials were tightly closed and the reaction mixture was heated at 120 C for 60 h. After that time liquid products were purified from catalyst using column chromatography (aminomodified silica gel MN-60) and isolated by vacuum distillation.

Cross-metathesis of allylsilanes In general, all reactions were carried out in the same way as metathesis reactions. 3.7. Cross-metathesis of allyltriethoxysilane with allyltrimethylsilane The catalyst RuC12(PPh3)3 0.02 g (2.1 X 10-5 mol) was dissolved in 1 ml dried benzene and then a mixture of 1.0 ml (4.7 X 10-3 mol) allyltriethoxysilane and 0.75 ml (4.7 X 10-3 mol) allyltrimethylsilane was added to the catalyst solutions. The course of the reaction was followed by GLC. The products of the reaction were identified by GC/MS and NMR spectroscopy by comparing their parameters with those of the authentic samples [ 12 ] . 3.8. Cross-metathesis of allyltriethoxysilane with vinyltrimethylsilane The catalyst RuC12(PPh,), 0.02 g (2.1 X 10-5 mol) was dissolved in 1 ml dried benzene and then a mixture of 1.0 ml (4.7 X 10-3 mol) allyltriethoxysilane and 0.69 ml (4.7 X 10-3 mol) vinyltrimethylsilane was added to the catalyst solutions. The course of the reaction was followed by GLC. The products of the reaction were identified by GC/MS and NMR spectroscopy by comparing their parameters with those of authentic samples [ 12] . 3.9. Cross-metathesis of allyltriethoxysilane with vinyldimetylethoxysilane The catalyst RuC12(PPh,), 0.02 g (2.1 X 10- 5 mol) was dissolved in 1 ml dried benzene and then a mixture of 1.0 ml (4.7 X 10-3 mol) allyltriethoxysilane and 0.78 ml (4.7 X 10-3 132 B. Marciniec et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 90 (1994) 125-133 mol) vinyldimethylethoxysilane was added to the catalyst solutions. The course of the reaction was followed by GLC. The products of the reaction were identified by GC/MS and NMR spectroscopy by comparing their parameters with those of authentic samples [14]. 3.10. Cross-metathesis of allyltriethoxysilane with 1-decene The catalyst RuC12(PPh3)30.02g (2.1 X 10-5 mol) was dissolved in 1 ml dried benzene and then a mixture of 1.0 ml (4.7 X 10-3 mol) allyltriethoxysilane and 0.9 ml (4.7 X 10-3 mol) 1-decene was added to the catalyst solutions. The course of the reaction was followed by GLC. The products of the reaction were identified by GC/MS and NMR spectroscopy by comparing their parameters with those of authentic samples [ 15 ] . 4. Conclusions An untypical, in comparison to classical metathesis catalyst, metathetical conversion of allylsilanes in the presence of ruthenium complexes has been found. It was proved that allyltrisubstituted silanes first undergo isomerization to 1-propenyltrisubstituted silanes followed by cross-metathesis to give his (silyl)propene. A similar metathesis reaction with 1-alkenes and vinylsilanes confirmed this reaction pathway. The obtained results provide convincing evidence for direct metathetical activation of ruthenium catalysts by vinyl-substituted silanes, to which allylsilane should be firstly isomerized.

Metathetical activity of allylsubstituted silanes in the presence of ruthenium catalyst Bogdan Marciniec ∗ Zenon Foltynowicz Mariusz Lewandowski Faculty of Chemistry, Adam Mickiewicz University, Grunwaldzka 6, 60-780 Poznan, Poland * Corresponding author. Untypical catalysis by ruthenium complexes in metathetical conversion of allylsubstituted silanes has been observed in which allylsilanes first undergo isomerization to 1-propenyl-trisubstituted silanes which is followed by their cross-metathesis with the parent allylsilanes. The allylsilanes cross-metathesis with some vinylsilanes and 1-alkenes has been found to proceed likewise. Keywords allyl derivatives metathesis ruthenium silanes References [1] B. Marciniec B.
