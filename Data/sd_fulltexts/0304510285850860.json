The stoichiometric hydrogenation of Schiff bases with HCo(CO)4 is a two-step process with an imine'HCo(CO)4 adduct as an intermediate. Introduction Catalytic hydrogenations using Co2(CO)g have been widely investigated with various unsaturated substrates [1]. Very little is known, however, about the mechanism of hydrogenation in the case of compounds having carbon-nitrogen double bonds. The reduction of AT-benzylideneaniline [2, 3] or N-benzylidene-o.o-diethylaniline [3] with synthesis gas in the presence of Co2(CO)g catalyst precursor gives high yields of the corresponding benzyl- amines. In the absence of hydrogen, facile carbonylations take place [3,4]. We now report on the kinetics of imine hydrogenation under catalytic and stoichiometric conditions. Results and discussion N-Benzylideneaniline was smoothly hydrogenated to JV-benzylaniline with H; + CO (1:1, 100 bar) and Co2(CO)s as catalyst precursor at 95 C in toluene solution (eqn. I): PhCH=NPh + H2 co:!(co)8'co PhCH2NHPh (1) Under such conditions, hydrogenation proceeded with 100% selectivity and no side reactions (such as carbonylations) took place. 0304-5102/85/$3.30 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 344 10-'r Ms-i / /< lO^Co^lCOlg] M 0 20 40 60 90 100 01234 105r Ms-1 3 - \\, PCO bar 0 20 40 60 60 100 Fig. I.

The catalytic hydrogenation showed first-order dependence in Co;- (C0)g (if [Co2(CO)g] < 0.025 M) and in PH, ^ PH,< 50 bar), and negative first-order dependence in Ppo (between 10 and 45 bar).

The reac- tion was zero-order with respect to the substrate within one experiment (Fig. 2). On comparing these results with those of earlier experiments on the rate of HCo(CO)4 formation from Co2(CO)8 and Hz [5] (eqn. 2), it became apparent that the latter is practically identical with the rate of the catalytic hydrogenation of A^-benzylideneaniline (extrapolated to zero imine concen- tration) and shows similar dependences on Co2(CO)s, PH ^d PCO as describ- ed above for eqn.(1). Co2(CO)s + H, ^ 2HCo(CO)4 (2) The only difference between the kinetic characteristics of the two reactions was the dependence on N-benzylideneaniline concentration in the case of reaction (1) (Fig. 3). This can be regarded, however, as the result of the promoting effect of N-bases on reaction (2), also described earlier [6]. Accordingly, HCo(CO)4 is most probably the actual reducing agent in the catalytic cycle, and the rate of hydrogenation is determined by the rate of its formation from Co2(CO)g (Scheme 1). PhC^NHPh Scheme 1. PhCH=NPh This interpretation of the results is strongly supported by the fact that HCo- (00)4 reacted rapidly with A^-benzylideneaniline in a stoichiometric reaction even at 60 C (eqn. 3). 346 C0,lbar PhCH=NPh + 2HCo(CO)4 > PhC^NHPh + Co^COg (3) It therefore became evident that further information about the mecha- nism of the catalytic hydrogenation reaction could only be obtained by investigating this stoichiometric reaction in more detail. It is known that Et3N gives an adduct with HCo(CO)4, which shows a characteristic infrared spectrum [7]. This adduct has been isolated and shown to contain a Co H N bond. Using equimolar amounts of HCo(CO)4 and JV-benzylideneaniline, however, we were not able to observe such an adduct, but only the products indicated in eqn. (3). Experiments with less reactive substrates such as EtCH^NCHMe; or Me(i-Bu)C==NPh were more successful. Yellow crystalline adducts were formed with HCo(CO)4 in a 1:1 molar ratio at 60 C which decomposed slowly above 0 C. These adducts showed infrared spectra in the r(C 0) region similar to that of Et3N' HCo(CO)4 (EtCH=NCHMe2-HCo(CO)4: 2020w, 1931s, 1896vs and Me(i- Bu)C==NPh-HCo(CO)4: 2022w, 1931s, 1904vs cm-'); they could be con- verted into the corresponding hydrogenated products and Co2(CO)g by adding a second mole of HCo(CO)4.

(4a) and (4b). Accordingly, the first hydrogen atom is transferred onto the nitro- gen atom over an adduct with a Co H N bond, and the second hydrogen atom originating from the second molecule of cobalt carbonyl hydride becomes attached to the carbon atom of the C=N bond. Some information about the second hydrogen transfer could be obtain- ed from the observation that the rate of the stoichiometric hydrogenations Fig. 4. Conversion of HCo(CO)4 with time atPpo = 3 bar (+) andPgo a! 1 bar (0) in tolu- ene solution: (a) [PhCH-= NPh] = 0.06 M, [HCo(CO)4] = 0.04 M at 15 C; (b) [Me(i-Bu)- C NPh] = 0.08 M, [HCo(CO)4] = 0.12 M at +30 C. 347 showed a negative dependence on Pco (Fig. 4). This can be explained by the assumption that the second mole of HCo(CO)4 has to lose a CO ligand in this process. The most plausible explanation of this observation is the forma- tion of an intermediate containing a TT-bonded C=N group (eqn. 5) which then decomposes into the saturated amine and 2(00)7 (eqn. 6).

The catalytic hydrogenations were run in a 20 ml stainless-steel thermostatted rocking autoclave using 5 ml samples of a freshly prepared solution containing JV-benzylideneaniline and Co2(CO)s. After purging and pressurizing with CO:H2 mixtures at room temperature, the reaction was started by immersing the autoclave into the preheated thermostatting equip- ment. The reaction time was corrected empirically for the warming-up period. The reaction was followed by gas chromatography of the quenched reaction mixture (Hewlett-Packard Model 5830A, 10 m glass capillary column, OV-1 stationary phase, 10 C min~1, Ar, FID). Kinetic experiments with HCo(CO)4 under atmospheric pressure or under 3 bar CO pressure were run in a thermostatted glass apparatus. The reaction was started by injecting the HCo(CO)4 solution in toluene into the vigorously stirred solution of the substrates. GLC analyses were made after quenching with a 5-fold molar excess of a NaOEt-piperidine mixture. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Carl Zeiss Jena IR 75 spectrophoto- meter using a CaF2 cuvette (0.11 mm). References 1 B. R.
