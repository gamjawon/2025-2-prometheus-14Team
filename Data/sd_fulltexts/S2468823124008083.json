In the days that followed, countless messages and tributes poured in from friends and colleagues across Italy, reflecting the deep respect and admiration he had earned over the years. Among the many heartfelt messages was one that captured the essence of his impact: \"More than the teacher, I want to remember with great affection and sorrow the friend Rosario, who was always there for me with his wise and clear advice, always free from condescension and full of humanity. I was truly fortunate to have met him on my journey. I will miss him dearly.\" The career of prof. Rosario Pietropaolo: a lifelong dedication to science and academia Rosario Pietropaolo was born on August 17th, 1941, in Bagnara Calabra, a small-town neighbor to Scilla, the birthplace of Raffaele Piria, who is considered one of the fathers of aspirin for his pioneering work in preparing salicylic acid from the salicylin of willow bark. He earned his degree in Chemistry with honors in June 1964 from the University of Messina. Following his graduation, he served as a Teaching Assistant in the Chair of General and Inorganic Chemistry at the University of Messina from September 1st, 1964, to June 30, 1966, and as an Associate Assistant from July 1st, 1966, to October 31st, 1975. Between 1965 and 1969, he conducted research at the University of Padova. In 1969, he was awarded a prestigious C.N.R. fellowship, allowing him to conduct research as a \"visiting lecturer\" at the laboratory of Professor B.L. Shaw at the University of Leeds. From December 1971 to October 31, 1974, he served as the Director of the Institute of General Chemistry at the University of Messina. In 1985, he was appointed to the Chair of Chemistry at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Reggio Calabria. In 1986, he became the first Dean of the Faculty of Engineering, a position he held until 1991. In June 1989, he was elected Rector of the University of Reggio Calabria, a role he would hold through three terms until 1999. During his tenure as Rector, he oversaw the construction and development of the university as it is known today, and the first autonomy statute of the university was enacted under his leadership. As Rector, Prof. Rosario Pietropaolo actively participated in the Bologna Process, the international reform initiative of higher education systems in the European region, promoted by the Council of Europe, aimed to establish the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) by 2010. He was present in Bologna when 29 European Ministers of Education gathered on June 18th-19th, 1999, to sign the agreement known as the \"Bologna Declaration.\" From 1992 to 1996, he was a member of the Presidency Committee of the Conference of Italian University Rectors (CRUI). He also served on the Italian University Council (CUN) as a Rector's delegate, where he played a crucial role in the development of new degree programs in Italy around the year 2000. When he ended his term of rector in 1999, he received from the Italian Ministry of Research On. Ortensio Zecchino, a letter of acknowledgments for his mandate (Fig. 1 ). When he stepped down as rector, he actively resumed his research work, always remaining in service to the Engineering community at the Università degli Studi Mediterranea di Reggio Calabria. From October 1999 to October 2005, he served as the Director of the MecMat Department. Prof. Rosario Pietropaolo retired on November 1st, 2011, after more than 40 years of service as a university professor, during which he taught inorganic chemistry, radiochemistry, organometallic chemistry, and general chemistry to engineering students. A passionate lover of philosophy, he employed Socratic methods in his teaching, guiding students to develop independent thinking and their perspectives. He also authored a university textbook, Lezioni di Chimica, co-written with Paolo Finocchiaro and published by Schonenfeld & Ziegler. In August 2012, Rosario Pietropaolo was honored with the title of Professor Emeritus by the Italian Ministry of Research, bestowed by Prof. Francesco Profumo. Throughout his career, he was an active member of the Evaluation Unit (Nucleo di Valutazione) and served on the Board of Administration at the University of Catania. He was also a member of the Board of Directors of the CARICAL Foundation. Prof. Rosario Pietropaolo received numerous awards and recognitions throughout his distinguished career, among which he particularly cherished the \"Calabresi nel mondo\" gold medal, awarded to him in April 1992 at the Campidoglio in Rome from the then-President of the Italian Republic Oscar Luigi Scalfaro for his contributions to renewing the ancient tradition of the Calabrian people and honoring Italy (Fig. 2 ). The \"San Giorgio d'Oro,\" the highest civic honor awarded by the city of Reggio Calabria and named after its patron saint, St. George, was another important award that deeply resonated with Prof. Rosario Pietropaolo, reflecting his significance to both the city and the region. He received this prestigious recognition in 2014 for his key role in the construction of the Università degli Studi Mediterranea di Reggio Calabria. His enduring commitment with the academic discipline “Principles of chemistry for applied technologies” Prof. Rosario Pietropaolo had a profound and lasting relationship with the academic discipline \"CHIM/07 - Principles of Chemistry for Applied Technologies\" (now “CHEM-06/A - Chemical Foundations of Technologies”). For over 30 years, he taught in engineering programs, dedicating himself to strengthening collaboration between researchers and faculty who, like him, were responsible for teaching chemistry within engineering departments across Italy. Notably, between 1997 and 1999, he played a crucial role in the reform and definition of disciplinary groups, leading to the establishment of the then academic field CHIM/07. Throughout the years, he fiercely defended this academic discipline during various tentative reforms of scientific-disciplinary sectors, which at times seemed to threaten the uniqueness and significance of this specialized area, what he always considered “the home” to chemistry professors in engineering schools and departments. He was a founding member of the AICIng Association (Italian Association Chemistry for Engineering) that he served as President during the 2005/2006 biennium. He greatly valued the AICIng award, which he received at the 2010 Bressanone conference in recognition of his significant contributions to Engineering Chemistry in Italy. At that event, he inaugurated the conference with a plenary lecture titled \"From Piria to Modern Green Chemistry\". Prof. Rosario Pietropaolo's unwavering dedication to his academic discipline field was evident in his attendance at every AICIng conference, even during the most challenging periods of his life when his health was severely compromised. Despite these hardships, his commitment never wavered. Always seated in the front row with his signature cap, he was ready to contribute, offering insights that often-shed new light on the research being presented. His sharp intellect and passion for academic discussion sparked lively, stimulating exchanges. His contributions were not merely comments but invaluable insights that opened new paths for exploration and debate. In 2019, he was one of the supporters for the establishment of the new Division of \"Chemical Foundations of Technologies\" within the Italian Chemical Society (SCI). In celebration of his 80th birthday, the CHIM/07 community organized a conference in Reggio Calabria (XII Convegno Nazionale AICIng, Reggio Calabria, 5th-8th September 2021) to honor him. The event drew 171 participants from 31 universities. At the conclusion of the conference, Prof. Rosario Pietropaolo was celebrated with a tribute that reflected the deep admiration and affection of the community: \"The feelings we have for Prof. Rosario Pietropaolo can be summed up in three words: Respect, Love, and Gratitude. Respect for his vast knowledge and passion for science. Love for his pivotal role in building a strong, cohesive, and harmonious community within our discipline. Gratitude for his tireless efforts in championing the role of chemistry in engineering faculties at the highest levels and for founding our association.\" (Fig. 3 ) Early years of a brilliant scientific career: advancements in homogeneous catalysis (1960s-1970s) From a scientific point of view, during the 1960s and 1970s, in the early stages of his career, Prof. Rosario Pietropaolo was deeply engaged in research on homogeneous catalysis, with a particular focus on transition metal complexes. During this time, he focused on the structural and bonding aspects of π-allylic complexes of palladium. His early publications explored the mechanisms by which metal complexes, particularly those involving platinum and palladium, could facilitate catalytic processes [1,2]. His work on the hydrogenation of olefins using platinum complexes demonstrated not only high activity but also remarkable selectivity, which is crucial for industrial applications [3]. He made significant contributions to organometallic chemistry through his research on the insertion of sulfur dioxide into platinum-carbon σ-bonds, uncovering important mechanisms for the functionalization of platinum complexes [4]. Additionally, he explored the synthesis and reactivity of palladium and platinum dienyl complexes, which are essential in various catalytic processes, including polymerization and organic synthesis [5]. Notably, during his time at the University of Leeds in Bernard Shaw's lab, Prof. Rosario Pietropaolo conducted pioneering ¹H and ¹³C NMR studies on π-allylic-palladium complexes [6]. This work provided crucial insights into the electronic structure and bonding characteristics of these complexes, significantly advancing the understanding of their behavior in catalytic reactions and contributing to the development of more efficient catalytic systems. The father of the school of chemistry at the University of Reggio Calabria: foundations of chemical technologies through heterogeneous catalysis (1980s-2000s) As Prof. Rosario Pietropaolo's career progressed, his research focus shifted towards heterogeneous catalysis during the 1980s and early 2000s, particularly at the University of Reggio Calabria. He extensively studied the catalytic properties of d-block transition metals such as palladium and platinum, in various hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions. His research demonstrated how these catalysts could be effectively used in the reduction of organic compounds, such as aldehydes and nitriles, to produce valuable chemicals with high selectivity [7–9]. His research made notable strides in the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, focusing on achieving selective reductions crucial for producing fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Prof. Rosario Pietropaolo showed how catalysts like platinum and palladium could be fine-tuned to either target the carbon-carbon double bond or the carbonyl group, depending on the desired product. This selectivity was key in optimizing industrial processes by improving yields and minimizing unwanted byproducts [7–9]. In his studies on cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation, Prof. Rosario Pietropaolo emphasized the importance of catalyst modification in controlling reaction pathways, offering practical insights for industrial applications. His work demonstrated that the addition of metal chlorides could significantly influence the selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic process [10–12]. His research on citral, an important component in the production of fragrances and flavors, focused on achieving selective hydrogenation to produce either citronellal or geraniol, depending on the desired end product [13–15]. Prof. Rosario Pietropaolo's studies demonstrated how careful control of reaction conditions and catalyst selection could steer the hydrogenation process towards one product over another, which is critical in the flavor and fragrance industries where specific isomers are needed. Moreover, his research extended to the interaction of cis-2-butene-1,4-diol with palladium and platinum catalysts, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms of hydrogenation and isomerization reactions [16–20]. These works not only advanced the theoretical understanding of these catalytic processes but also had practical implications for the development of more effective industrial catalysts. The last scientific dance: pioneering green chemistry (2010s-2020s) In the final decade of his career, Prof. Rosario Pietropaolo turned his attention to green chemistry. His work during this period was particularly focused on the catalytic conversion of biomass-derived molecules, aiming to develop sustainable methods for producing valuable chemicals from renewable resources. One of his most notable contributions during this period was his pioneering study on the transfer hydrogenolysis of glycerol, a byproduct of biodiesel production. His research demonstrated that supported palladium catalysts could effectively catalyze the hydrogenolysis of glycerol to produce 1,2-propanediol, a compound widely used in the chemical industry. This work was particularly significant as it provided a sustainable method for converting a waste product (glycerol) into a value-added chemicals, aligning with the principles of green chemistry [21–24]. Prof. Rosario Pietropaolo explored the catalytic hydrogenolysis of other biomass-derived polyols, such as sorbitol and xylitol. His studies on the selective cleavage of CO bonds in these polyols using metal catalysts provided new insights into the design of catalytic processes for the production of renewable chemicals [25]. He also made significant advancements in the field of bioethanol production, particularly focusing on the direct conversion of cellulose to ethanol without the need for extensive pretreatment procedures. This research was particularly important in the context of renewable energy, as it provided a cleaner and more efficient process for producing biofuels, which are essential for reducing reliance on fossil fuels [26]. One of Prof. Rosario Pietropaolo's last contributions to green chemistry was his research on the catalytic transfer hydrogenolysis of lignin-derived compounds [27–29]. Lignin, a complex polymer found in plant cell walls, represents a challenging substrate for chemical conversion due to its heterogeneous and recalcitrant structure. His studies demonstrated that using supported palladium catalysts, it was possible to selectively break down lignin into aromatic compounds such as phenols and benzene derivatives, which are valuable building blocks in the chemical industry. This work provided a viable pathway for the valorization of lignin, turning a low-value byproduct of the paper and biofuel industries into high-value chemicals. These contributions were crucial in advancing the field of green chemistry, particularly in the development of sustainable chemical processes that align with the principles of the circular economy. The VSI in his honor published in molecular catalysis journal In his memory, this Virtual Special Issue 'Rosario Pietropaolo' was launched in November 2022 in Molecular Catalysis, an initiative made possible through the support and dedication of the past Editor-in-Chief, Prof. Rafael Luque. The special issue has received numerous contributions from Prof. Rosario Pietropaolo's friends, colleagues, and collaborators, who wish to honor his legacy by dedicating their research to him. Among contributions, Prof. Maria Michela Dell'Anna developed N-doped resin-supported cobalt nanoparticles for the catalytic reduction of nitroarenes to corresponding anilines in an aqueous medium [30]. This study is particularly significant for the synthesis of anilines, which are key intermediates in producing dyes, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals. The research emphasizes the use of cobalt as a cost-effective and sustainable alternative to precious metals, aligning with green chemistry principles. Prof. Eleonora Aneggi contributed with her work on the solvent-free selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol using ruthenium-loaded ceria-zirconia catalysts. This process is essential for producing benzaldehyde, a valuable compound in the fragrance and pharmaceutical industries. The solvent-free approach not only improves efficiency but also reduces environmental impact, which is central to the ethos of sustainable catalysis [31]. Prof. Raffaele Cucciniello explored the use of I-Layered Double Hydroxides (I-LDH) as heterogeneous bifunctional catalysts for converting CO2 into cyclic organic carbonates. His research addresses the urgent need for carbon capture and utilization technologies, transforming CO2, a major greenhouse gas, into valuable chemical products [32]. This work highlights the potential of catalysis in contributing to global sustainability efforts. In another significant contribution, Prof. Isabella Chiarotto focused on the electrochemical bottom-up synthesis of biomass-derived carbon dots, which are then used to promote Knoevenagel condensation reactions [33]. This innovative approach combines green chemistry with advanced nanotechnology, offering a sustainable route to producing carbon dots and enhancing their application in organic synthesis. Prof. Josip Bronić contributed research on the modification of ZSM-5 zeolites by combining hierarchization with Mg2+ ion insertion to tune their acidity for optimal performance in the Methanol-to-Olefins (MTO) reaction [34]. This study is particularly relevant to the petrochemical industry, where the optimization of MTO processes is crucial for producing ethylene and propylene, fundamental building blocks for a wide range of chemicals. Prof. Marianna Bellardita prepared CuBi2O4/TiO2 hetero-systems, which are employed for the selective oxidation of 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol under simulated solar light. Her work is significant in the field of photocatalysis, where the development of efficient and selective oxidation reactions is crucial for environmental and industrial applications [35]. Prof. Francesco Parrino presented two contributions. The first deals with the generation of nitrate radicals via TiO2 heterogeneous photocatalysis and their application in cleaving C=C double bonds to form carbonyl compounds [36]. This research advances the field of advanced oxidation processes, which are essential for water treatment and environmental remediation. His second contribution focuses on the application of advanced oxidation processes, including photocatalysis, for removing off-flavours such as geosmin (GSM) and 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) from recirculating aquaculture systems [37]. This work is vital for improving water quality in aquaculture, promoting healthier environments for fish farming. Prof. Giuseppe Marcì investigated the use of Nb2O5 and niobium-based oxides as redox photocatalysts for the partial oxidation of 2-propanol and hydrogen generation by photoreforming [38]. This research is significant for its dual approach to producing valuable chemicals and clean energy, addressing both environmental and industrial challenges. Prof. Gloria Mazzone contributed a study on the use of a manganese PNN pincer complex in the hydrogenation of carbamate and urea derivatives, with a detailed examination of the reaction mechanism using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations [39]. Her research is relevant to the synthesis of nitrogen-containing compounds, which have important applications in pharmaceuticals and agriculture. Finally, Prof. Tommaso Tabanelli and Prof. Emilia Paone focused on the catalytic upgrading of orange peel waste-derived methyl levulinate and limonene into valuable chemicals like γ-valerolactone and p-cymene using Pd/ZrO2 and ZrO2 catalysts [40]. Their research reflects the principles of green chemistry, converting agricultural waste into valuable resources, and contributing to the development of sustainable chemical processes.
