Graphical abstract An efficient and robust in situ surface-confined strategy was demonstrated for the fabrication of single-atom Fe-N4 on N-doped carbon nanoleaves (L-FeNC). Benefiting from abundant Fe-N4 active sites, enhanced mass and charge transfer, L-FeNC delivered superior performance for ORR and Zn-air battery to commercial Pt/C. Controllable fabrication of Fe-N-C based single-atom catalysts (SACs) for enhanced electrocatalytic performance is highly desirable but still challenging. Here, an in situ surface-confined strategy was demonstrated for the synthesis of single atomic Fe-N4 on N-doped carbon nanoleaves (L-FeNC). The in situ generated Zn3[Fe(CN)6]2 could not only serve as a protection layer against collapse of nanoleaves but also provide abundant Fe source for the formation of Fe-N moieties during pyrolysis, leading to high surface area and high graphitization degree of L-FeNC simultaneously. Benefiting from abundant Fe-N4 active sites, enhanced mass and charge transfer, the as-prepared L-FeNC manifested a half-wave potential of 0.89 V for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in 0.1 M KOH. A maximum power density of 140 mW cm−2 and stable discharge voltage even after operation for 50,000 s have been demonstrated when the L-FeNC was used as air cathode for Zn-air battery. This work not only provided a unique surface-confined strategy for the synthesis of two-dimensional nanocarbons, but also demonstrated the significant benefit from rational design and engineering of Fe-N-C SACs, thus offering great opportunities for fabrication of efficient energy conversion and storage devices. Keywords Single atom catalyst Iron-nitrogen-carbon Surface confine Oxygen reduction reaction Metal-organic frameworks 1 Introduction Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted considerable attention in various catalytic processes because they can combine the merits of both homogeneous catalysts and heterogeneous catalysts [1–3]. As one of the most intriguing SACs, iron–nitrogen-carbon (Fe-N-C) based SACs have flourished as promising candidates in many valuable electrocatalytic processes, including oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) [4–12], oxygen evolution reaction (OER) [13,14], CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) [15,16] and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) [17] because of their high activity, high selectivity and low cost. Developing novel and controllable synthetic strategy will enrich the inventory of the synthetic methods of Fe-N-C SACs and push their application into a more practical direction. Direct pyrolysis of precursors containing iron, carbon and nitrogen species at high temperature (usually > 700 °C) has been the most popular methods, but it has been suffering from severe aggregations of Fe-N x moieties and formation of less active metallic iron clusters, iron oxides or iron carbides due to limited chemical control during the complex high-temperature reactions [18]. In order to solve this problem, confined pyrolysis using SiO2 as protection layers has proven to be an effective way in restricting metal moieties and trapping volatile species during pyrolysis [19–21]. However, this method involves tedious post-treatment under harsh conditions (e.g., HF solution) to remove inert SiO2, which may also cause damages to active sites [18]. In this context, fabrication of Fe-N-C SACs via an in situ surface-confined strategy, in which iron-based precursor serves as surface-confined layer, is highly desirable because this strategy not only eliminates the need of inert SiO2 shell coating and removal, but also in situ generates the active Fe-N x sites via thermolysis of surface iron species. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), consisting of metal nodes and organic ligands, are expected to be promising scaffolds for the fabrication of Fe-N-C SACs because of their unique properties, such as high surface areas, well-defined structures and rich surface chemistry [22,23]. Upon pyrolysis, the organic ligands will be converted into N-doped carbon that can anchor the iron atom through Fe-N coordination [24]. As a common subclass of MOFs, Zn-based zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) have been widely used for fabricating Fe-N-C SACs because Zn-based ZIFs can effectively anchor and isolate single-atom Fe-N x sites [25,26]. However, for conventional ZIFs-derived Fe-N-C SACs, the majority of Fe-N moieties were inactive because they were mainly hosted in microporous carbon which made them inaccessible [27]. Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have attracted great effort in catalysis because of their high surface-to-volume ratio, short ion and electron diffusion length [28–32]. In this respect, anchoring Fe-N moieties on 2D nanocarbons is expected to ensure the exposure of more Fe-N x sites and favor mass and charge transfer, thereby achieve higher catalytic performance. Inspired by above-mentioned discussion, herein we demonstrated an in situ surface-confined strategy for fabricating single-atom Fe-N4 sites on N-doped carbon nanoleaves (L-FeNC). The formation mechanism was also revealed by combining series of characterizations, including thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which help to understand the formation of SACs from MOFs and may bring more opportunities for the synthesis and application of a wide range of M-N-Cs. As an ORR electrocatalyst, L-FeNC manifested a half-wave potential (E 1/2) of 0.89 V in 0.1 M KOH, which was better than that of commercial Pt/C (0.86 V). The as-prepared L-FeNC also showed higher stability and better methanol resistance than Pt/C. When L-FeNC was applied in Zn-air battery, it delivered a power density of 140 mW cm−2, which was significantly higher than that based on Pt/C (87 mW cm−2). 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 2-methylimidazole (2-mIm), K3[Fe(CN)6], FeSO4·7H2O and Nafion solution were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. KOH (>99.99%) was purchased from Aladdin. The commercial Pt/C catalysts were purchased from Alfa Aesar (20 wt% Pt on carbon black, HiSPEC 3000). The particle sizes of Pt are about (3.45 ± 0.3) nm. All the chemicals were used without further purification. Ultra-pure water (18.2 MΩ) was obtained from Milli-Q water system. 2.2 Synthesis of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks nanoleaf (ZIF-L) First, two solutions were prepared by dissolving 1 mmol of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O in 20 mL of deionized water and 8 mmol of 2-mIm in 20 mL of deionized water, respectively. Then, the solution of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O was poured into the solution of 2-mIm. Next, the mixed solution was vigorously stirred at room temperature for 12 h. The precipitates were separated by centrifugation and washed with deionized water for three times. Then, the products were dispersed in 10 mL deionized water. 2.3 Synthesis of Fe-ZIF-L The Fe-ZIF-L was prepared by using ZIF-L as precursor. In a typical synthesis of Fe-ZIF-L-0.3, aqueous solution of K3[Fe(CN)6] (20 mL, 5 mg mL−1) was added into 10 mL of ZIF-L suspension under stirring. After stirring for 4 h at room temperature, Fe-ZIF-L was separated by centrifugation and washed with deionized water for three times, followed by drying at 60 °C overnight. For the synthesis of other Fe-ZIF-L samples, different amount of K3[Fe(CN)6] (33 mg for Fe-ZIF-L-0.1, 66 mg for Fe-ZIF-L-0.2, and 132 mg for Fe-ZIF-L-0.4) was added. 2.4 Synthesis of Fe doped ZIF-L For comparison, Fe doped ZIF-L was synthesized by using FeSO4·7H2O as iron precursor. First, two solutions were prepared by dissolving 1 mmol of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.02 mmol FeSO4·7H2O in 20 mL of deionized water and 8 mmol of 2-mIm in 20 mL of deionized water, respectively. Then, the solution of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O was poured into the solution of 2-mIm. Next, the mixed solution was vigorously stirred at room temperature for 12 h. The precipitates were separated by centrifugation and washed with deionized water for three times, followed by drying at 60 °C overnight. 2.5 Synthesis of NC, FeNC and L-FeNC For the synthesis of L-FeNC, 80 mg Fe-ZIF-L was calcined at 900 °C for 2 h with a ramping rate of 5 °C min−1 in a tube furnace under Ar atmosphere. NC and FeNC were obtained by calcining ZIF-L and Fe doped ZIF-L under the same condition as L-FeNC. 2.6 Synthesis of NiFe LDH 1.5 mmol Ni(NO3)2 and 0.5 mmol Fe(NO3)3 were dissolved in 200 mL water. Then, 300 μL ammonium hydroxide were added into the solution. The resultant solution was transferred into the oven at 90 °C and aged for 2 h. The precipitates were separated by centrifugation and washed with deionized water for three times, followed by drying at 60 °C overnight. 2.7 Materials characterizations TEM characterizations were performed at 200 kV on TECNAI G2F20 from FEI. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were collected on Zeiss G500 from Carl Zeiss at 5 kV. XRD patterns were collected by a Bruker D8 Advance Diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were collected by SSIS-Probe XPS spectrometer. Raman spectra were carried out on a LabRAM HR800 Raman microscope. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were collected by using ASAP2020 HD88. 2.8 Electrochemical characterizations All electrochemical measurements were conducted with a CHI 660E in a three-electrode cell at room temperature. A graphitic rod, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and a glassy carbon electrode (5 mm in diameter) were used as the counter, reference and working electrodes, respectively. To prepare the working electrode, 5 mg of the catalyst was dispersed in the nafion solution containing 750 μL of water, 250 μL of isopropanol, and 50 μL of Nafion (5%) by ultrasonication for 1 h. Then 20 μL of the solution of catalyst was drop-casted on a polished RDE/RRDE electrode. Both of the loading amounts of Pt/C and L-FeNC are 0.5 mg cm−2. Before the electrochemical tests, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 for 20 cycles to activate the catalysts. LSV curves were collected at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 with the rotating rate of 1600 r min−1 in an O2 saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. In all ORR measurement, the potential of SCE were calibrated to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to the following equation: E RHE = E SCE + 0.059 pH + 0.244 The peroxide species and the electron transfer number (n) were obtained by RRDE at 1600 r min−1 based on the following equation: H 2 O 2 % = I r / N / I d + I r / N × 200 ; n = I d / I d + I r / N × 4 , where I d represents the disk current, I r represents the ring current, and N represents the current collection efficiency (0.37) of the RRDE. 2.9 Zn-air battery test Zn-air batteries were carried out in a two-electrode configuration by using L-FeNC on the Teflon-treated carbon fiber paper (CFP), polished Zn foil and 6 M KOH solution with 0.2 M zinc acetate as cathode, anode and electrolyte, respectively. The cathode electrodes were prepared by spraying the catalyst inks on CFP with the loading amount of 1 mg cm−2. The stability measurements were conducted at 40 mA cm−2 for 50,000 s. Cyclic charge and discharge were conducted at 2 mA cm−2 with alternating charge and discharge each for 300 s. 3 Results and discussion The fabrication process of L-FeNC was schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 . First, 2D zeolitic imidazolate frameworks nanoleaves (ZIF-L) were prepared in an aqueous solution by using Zn(NO3)2 and 2-mIm as metal precursor and ligand, respectively. With the assistance of H2O, the sodalite layers of ZIFs were connected by hydrogen bonds between 2-mIm and H2O, forming ZIFs with leaf-like structure [33,34]. Then, ZIF-L was etched by K3[Fe(CN)6] in aqueous solution. During this process, some Zn nodes in ZIF-L could coordinate with [Fe(CN)6]3− and form Zn3[Fe(CN)6]2 on the surface of ZIF-L, labelled as Fe-ZIF-L. L-FeNC was finally obtained by pyrolysis of Fe-ZIF-L at 900 °C under Ar atmosphere. During the pyrolysis, ZIF-L matrix was converted to N-doped carbon and anchored Fe-N species derived from [Fe(CN)6]3−. The fabrication process was monitored by using SEM and TEM. As presented in Fig. 2 (a and d), the original ZIF-L showed a uniform leaf-like morphology with lateral dimensions of approximately 6.0 μm × 2.5 μm (Fig. S1). After being etched by [Fe(CN)6]3−, the 2D leaf-like morphology was still maintained, while many small particles with sizes about tens of nanometers were presented on the surface (Fig. 2(b and e)). After pyrolysis at 900 °C under Ar atmosphere, leaf-like morphology was well-maintained in resulted L-FeNC (Fig. 2(c and f)), with an average lateral size of around 4.0 μm × 2.0 μm. In contrast, direct pyrolysis of pristine ZIF-L and Fe-doped ZIF-L at the same conditions led to sever aggregation (Fig. S2). The elemental distribution was revealed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), in which Fe, N and C elements were homogenously distributed on L-FeNC (Fig. 2(g)). The amount of iron in L-FeNC was determined to be about 2.6 wt% based on EDS results (Fig. S5). From X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of L-FeNC, two broad peaks located at around 25° and 44° were detectable, corresponding to the (002) and (101) planes of graphitic carbon. No peaks related to crystalline iron species were observed, which suggested that iron may be atomically dispersed on the carbon matrix (Fig. S6). To gain deeper understanding into the evolution from Fe-ZIF-L to L-FeNC, TGA was carried out within the temperature range from 50 to 950 °C under Ar atmosphere (Fig. 3 (a)). TGA curves of ZIF-L can be divided into three main stages: 50–290 °C, 290–840 °C and 840–950 °C. While for Fe-ZIF-L, three stages, named 50–300 °C, 300–780 °C and 780–950 °C, could be identified. In the first stage, the weight loss for ZIF-L (~17%) and Fe-ZIF-L (~13%) was attributed to the removal of guest water molecule and weakly linked 2-mIm [33]. The second stage can be described as the decomposition of 2-mIm into N-doped carbon, evaporation of Zn species and formation of Fe-N species. In the final stage, no obvious weight loss was detected. The remaining weight for ZIF-L and Fe-ZIF-L was 8% and 31%, respectively. Based on the TGA profiles of ZIF-L and Fe-ZIF-L, XRD measurements were further carried out to characterize pristine ZIF-L, Fe-ZIF-L and samples calcined at 300, 400, 500, 600, 700 and 800 °C. Pristine ZIF-L underwent crystal phase change into another form of Zn-2-mIm complex because of partial removal of water and 2-mIm ligand at 300 °C (Fig. 3(b)). From 300 to 600 °C, the Zn-2-mIm complex was relatively stable. When the calcination temperature was raised up to 700 °C, Zn nodes were converted into ZnO (JCPDS No. 36–1451). Diffraction peaks for ZnO disappeared at 800 °C, which was attributed to the carbothermal reduction of ZnO into metallic Zn and the evaporation of Zn [26]. In contrast, profiles of calcined Fe-ZIF-L samples were different from those of calcined ZIF-L samples (Fig. 3(c)). Zn3[Fe(CN)6]2 (JCPDS No. 38-0687) was deposited on the surface of nanoleaves after reaction between ZIF-L and [Fe(CN)6]2−. At 300 °C, diffraction peaks for Zn3[Fe(CN)6]2 and ZIF-L were still remained and no additional peaks were detected, suggesting that the introduction of Zn3[Fe(CN)6]2 could stabilize ZIF-L. From 400 to 500 °C, partial decomposing of Zn3[Fe(CN)6]2 and ZIF-L was observed, which caused broadening of diffraction peaks. Peaks that can be indexed as ZnO emerged at 600 °C and became sharper at 700 °C, indicating the formation and gradual growth of ZnO nanoparticles. When the calcination temperature was further increased, ZnO was reduced into metallic Zn and Zn was evaporated because of its relative low boiling point (~907 °C). In order to further explore the role of Zn3[Fe(CN)6]2 in the surface-confined pyrolysis process, attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy was collected for ZIF-L, ZIF-L-300, Fe-ZIF-L and Fe-ZIL-F-300 (Fig. 3(d)). The bands of ZIF-L, ZIF-L-300 at 1585, 600–800 and 423 cm−1 could be indexed as CN stretching, out-of-plane bending of imidazolate ring and Zn-N stretching, respectively, which was in line with the reported literature [35]. For Fe-ZIF-L, additional bands in 2000–2200, 600 and 495 cm−1 could be assigned to cyano-bridged complexes, stretching and bending of FeC, respectively, confirming the formation of Zn3[Fe(CN)6]2 in Fe-ZIF-L [36]. There was no obvious change in the FTIR spectrum for Fe-ZIF-L-300, further indicating that Zn3[Fe(CN)6]2 was stable at 300 °C. The surface Zn3[Fe(CN)6]2 not only served as protection layer against the phase change of ZIF-L at 300 °C but also provided abundant Fe source for the formation of Fe-N moieties at elevated temperature. In addition, morphological transformation of Fe-ZIF-L during pyrolysis was monitored by TEM (Fig. 4 (a–f)). After pyrolysis at 300 °C, leaf-like structure was well-maintained for Fe-ZIF-L, while pristine ZIF-L underwent severe structural change and aggregation because of losing guest water and weakly linked 2-mIm (Fig. S8). As annealing temperature increased to 500 °C, many small particles emerged on the surface of Fe-ZIF-L and became larger with increased temperature. From high-resolution TEM image (inset in Fig. 4(e)), the interspacing of small nanoparticles was about 0.248 nm, corresponding to (101) plane of ZnO, which was in good agreement with XRD patterns. Those ZnO nanoparticles vanished at 800 °C, which was attributed to the reduction of ZnO into metallic Zn and subsequent evaporation of Zn. Based on the above results, an in situ surface-confined pyrolysis mechanism was proposed for the formation of L-FeNC (Fig. 4(g)). For direct pyrolysis (Route 1), ZIF-L tended to undergo dramatic structure change even calcined at a low temperature of 300 °C because guest water molecule and weakly linked 2-mIm (17%) were lost during this process. While for in situ surface-confined pyrolysis (Route 2), [Fe(CN)6]3− coordinated with Zn nodes and formed Zn3[Fe(CN)6]2 on the surface of ZIF-L, which prevented ZIF-L from collapse because Zn3[Fe(CN)6]2 is stable at 300 °C. As temperature increased from 300 to 700 °C, [Fe(CN)6]3− was in situ converted into Fe-N species, while Zn species were converted into ZnO. Finally, Zn species underwent carbothermal reduction and evaporation from 700 to 900 °C. With the help of in situ surface-confined pyrolysis, L-FeNC was fabricated. In order to investigate the surface electronic state and chemical composition of L-FeNC, XPS was carried out (Fig. 5 ). The high-resolution N 1 s spectrum revealed the presence of pyridinic N (398.3 eV), pyrrolic N (400.2 eV), graphitic N (401.0 eV), oxidized-N (404.4 eV) and Fe-N (399.1 eV) [37]. High-resolution Fe 2p XPS spectrum was deconvoluted into 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of Fe-N (710.7 eV/724 eV) and satellite peaks (714.8 eV/730 eV) [38]. In addition, Fe K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) was conducted to figure out the local structures of Fe centers. Fe K-edge XANES spectra of L-FeNC, Fe foil and Fe phthalocyanine (FePc) reference were shown in Fig. 5(c). The pre-edge feature at ~ 7114 eV was detectable for L-FeNC and FePc, which should be related to the deviation of perfect Fe-N4 with square planar D 4h symmetry and the presence of axial ligand which was most likely absorbed O and/or hydroxyl groups [27,37]. Fourier transformed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) for L-FeNC in R space (Fig. 5(d)) showed a main peak at 1.5 Å, matching well with that of FePc reference, which was attributed to Fe-N scattering path. Furthermore, the absence of peak at 2.2 Å corresponding to Fe-Fe scattering path for L-FeNC suggested that Fe in L-FeNC was atomically dispersed. In order to reveal the distribution of Fe in L-FeNC, aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (AC-HAADF-STEM) at atomic resolution was conducted. Single-atomic iron was identified, as indicated by the bright spots in red circles (Fig. 5(e)). The atomic-scale electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) suggested the co-existence of Fe, N and C elements (Fig. 5(f)), which agreed well with XPS results. Combining EXAFS, HAADF-STEM and atomic level EELS data, it was safe to draw conclusion that single-atom Fe-N4 on N-doped carbon nanoleaves were successfully fabricated via the in situ surface-confined pyrolysis. As a demonstration, the ORR performance of L-FeNC was evaluated in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte in a typical three-electrode system (Fig. 6 ). The ORR performance of FeNC derived from Fe-doped ZIF-L, NC derived from ZIF-L and commercial Pt/C was also measured for comparison. After activation using CV, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of different samples are recorded using a rotating disk electrode (RDE) at 1600 r min−1. NC showed the lowest ORR activity in terms of overpotential and current density. FeNC and L-FeNC showed significantly decreased overpotential and higher current density, suggesting that Fe-N4 moieties were main active sites for ORR. L-FeNC manifested the highest ORR activity among the samples. Half-wave potential (E 1/2) and diffusion-limited current density (j L) were applied to quantify the ORR activities. L-FeNC displayed an E 1/2 of 0.89 V and a j L of 5.2 mA cm−2, which was better than those of FeNC (E 1/2 = 0.85 V, j L = 4.3 mA cm−2), NC (E 1/2 = 0.75 V, j L = 3.2 mA cm−2) and commercial Pt/C (E 1/2 = 0.86 V, j L = 5.2 mA cm−2) (Fig. S9). The Tafel slopes for NC, FeNC, Pt/C and L-FeNC are 119, 113, 122 and 109 mV dec−1, respectively. L-FeNC manefestes the lowest Tafel slope among all the samples, indicating its fastest ORR kinetics (Fig. S10). The high ORR activity also made L-FeNC among the best Fe-N-C-based ORR electrocatalysts (Table S1). Additionally, we investigated the ORR performance of L-FeNC with different [Fe(CN)6]3−/ZIF-L ratios (Figs. S11 and S12) and pyrolysis temperature (Fig. S13). The ORR activity increased initially with increment of [Fe(CN)6]3−, reaching a maximum at 0.3 and decreased with further increased [Fe(CN)6]3−. Furthermore, the pyrolysis temperature displayed remarkable influence on the catalytic activity. From the TEM images (Fig. S14), L-FeNC-850 °C, L-FeNC-900 °C and L-FeNC-950 °C show 2D leaf-like morphology. Two broad peaks located at around 25° and 44° were detectable, corresponding to the (002) and (101) planes of graphitic carbon (Fig. S15). No diffraction peaks relating to Fe species are observed from the XRD pattern of L-FeNC-850 °C, L-FeNC-900 °C and L-FeNC-950 °C. L-FeNC-900 °C manifested the highest ORR activity among all the three samples (Fig. S13). It is generally accepted that there are two kinds of reaction pathways of oxygen reduction, including a four-electron pathway to generate O2 and a two-electron pathway to generate H2O2. The four-electron pathway is considered as a more favorable pathway since the production of H2O2 in the two-electron pathway can damage the membrane of fuel cells and reduce energy-conversion efficiency. The ORR pathway of L-FeNC and Pt/C was investigated by conducting rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) measurement [39]. The L-FeNC showed a peroxide yield below 5% over the potential range of 0.4–0.8 V and electron transfer number was about 3.93, which was very close to that of commercial Pt/C (n = 3.99), indicating that L-FeNC was favorable for the four-electron pathway and the formation of H2O2 was largely depressed. The resistance to methanol crossover for ORR electrocatalysts is an important parameter for direct methanol fuel cells. Adding methanol into electrolyte brought negligible effect on L-FeNC, while commercial Pt/C showed significant decrease in current upon injection of methanol, implying that L-FeNC presented better resistance to methanol crossover than commercial Pt/C (Fig. 6(c)). The stability of catalysts is also important for practical application. We evaluated the ORR stability of L-FeNC and Pt/C based on chronoamperometry. As shown in Fig. 6(d), L-FeNC retained about 95% of its original current after 10000 s continuous operation while only 84% was maintained for commercial Pt/C. Since L-FeNC manifested good ORR activity and stability, we further demonstrated its application as cathode electrocatalysts for primary Zn-air battery. The maximum power density of Zn-air battery based on L-FeNC was 140 mW cm−2, which was significantly higher than that based on Pt/C (87 mW cm−2) under the same condition and other reported catalysts (Table S1). At a discharge current density of 40 mA cm−2, the initial voltage for L-FeNC was 1.18 V and maintained above 1.13 V after a continuous operation for 50,000 s. In contrast, the initial voltage for Pt/C was 1.15 V and dropped to 0.89 V after 50,000 s. The discharge profiles further demonstrated the superior stability of L-FeNC to Pt/C. For the application in rechargeable Zn-air battery, oxygen evolution reaction is also important. L-FeNC shows overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 larger than 500 mV in 1 M KOH. In order to achieve better OER performance, L-FeNC + NiFe-LDH composites are prepared via mixing NiFe-LDH with L-FeNC. The overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 for L-FeNC + NiFe-LDH composites is 330 mV, which is lower than that of Pt/C + Ir/C composites (410 mV) (Fig. S17). L-FeNC + NiFe LDH also showed faster OER kinetics than L-FeNC (196 mV dec−1) and Pt/C + Ir/C (119 mV dec−1) (Fig. S18). The charge and discharge curves for L-FeNC, Pt/C, L-FeNC + NiFe LDH and Pt/C + Ir/C were also tested (Fig. S19), in which L-FeNC + NiFe LDH showed comparable voltage gap with Pt/C + Ir/C. And galvanostatic discharge–charge measurements at a current density of 2 mA cm−2 for L-FeNC + NiFe LDH were measured as well (Fig. S20). The initial discharge and charge potentials are 1.15 and 1.95 V with a small charge/discharge voltage gap of 0.80 V. After 65,000 s, the charge/discharge voltage gap is 0.86 V. The low charge–discharge voltage gap and superior stability of L-FeNC may provide great opportunities for its practical application in Zn-air batteries. As ORR took place in the gas-electrode–electrolyte interfaces, high surface area and porosity of electrocatalysts are favorable for the improvement of ORR performances by allowing better access to active sites and more rapid mass transfer processes [40,41]. We evaluated the surface area and pore structure by nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms (Fig. 7 (a)). The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of NC and FeNC increase sharply in volume at low relative pressure. This indicated the presence of micropores which were mainly from ZIF-L derived NC. In contrast, N2 nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of L-FeNC can be identified as type-IV isotherms with remarkable hysteresis loop, which indicated the presence of abundant mesoporous with the help of the surface Zn3[Fe(CN)6]2. The specific surface area and cumulative pore volume of L-FeNC were 357 m2 g−1 and 0.34 cm3 g−1, respectively, much higher than that corresponding values for FeNC (238 m2 g−1 and 0.10 cm3 g−1) and NC (169 m2 g−1 and 0.07 cm3 g−1). Thus, the surface Zn3[Fe(CN)6]2 played an important role in preventing the aggregation and fusion of ZIF-L nanoparticles during the high-temperature pyrolysis. The high surface area and pore volume of L-FeNC originating from the in situ surface-confined strategy led to more exposed Fe-N4 active sites and facilitated the mass transfer, which was one of the reasons for the enhancement of the ORR performance. In order to get deeper insight into the high ORR performance of L-FeNC, Raman spectra of L-FeNC, FeNC and NC were conducted (Fig. 7(b)). Two dominant peaks located at 1345 and 1582 cm−1 were observed, which corresponded to the defects of carbon structure (D band) and graphitic carbon (G band), respectively. The ratio of the intensity of D band and G band (I D/I G) was indicative for the graphitization degree of carbon. The higher I D/I G indicates that more sp2-hybridized carbon atoms are present and this may be beneficial for accelerating the charge transfer rate. The values of I D/I G gradually decreased with the increase of Fe content in the ZIF precursors, which indicated that Fe content played an important role in controlling the degree of graphitization due to its catalytic effect. Increasing Fe content in the ZIF precursors can the graphitization degree of the ZIF-L derived carbons. The I D/I G of L-FeNC (1.17) was much lower than that of FeNC (1.37) and NC (1.39), indicating that L-FeNC possessed more sp2-hybridized carbon atoms are present in this carbon, which facilitated the fast electron transfer. For conventional pyrolytic synthesis of Fe-N-C electrocatalysts, higher graphitization degree of carbon always lowered the surface area. However, in our in situ surface-confined synthesis, the surface iron species not only protected the morphology of nanoleaves from fusion and aggregation, but also catalyzed the graphitization of carbon, simultaneously enhanced mass and electron transfer and accelerated the ORR kinetics. 4 Conclusions In summary, an efficient and robust in situ surface-confined strategy was demonstrated for the fabrication of single-atom Fe-N4 on N-doped carbon nanoleaves. With the help of this strategy, L-FeNC possessed higher surface area, larger pore volume and better graphitization. Benefiting from abundant Fe-N4 active sites, enhanced mass and charge transfer, L-FeNC manifested superior ORR activity and stability to commercial Pt/C. When applied as air cathode for Zn-air battery, L-FeNC delivered a maximum power density of 140 mW cm−2 and stable discharge voltage even after a continuous operation of 50,000 s. This work not only provided detailed mechanism studies on the formation of Fe-N-C SACs via in situ surface-confined strategy, but also demonstrated the significant benefit from rational design and engineering of Fe-N-C SACs for higher electrochemical performance, thus paving the way for fabrication of efficient energy conversion and storage devices.

        "dc:description": "Controllable fabrication of Fe-N-C based single-atom catalysts (SACs) for enhanced electrocatalytic performance is highly desirable but still challenging. Here, an in situ surface-confined strategy was demonstrated for the synthesis of single atomic Fe-N4 on N-doped carbon nanoleaves (L-FeNC). The in situ generated Zn3[Fe(CN)6]2 could not only serve as a protection layer against collapse of nanoleaves but also provide abundant Fe source for the formation of Fe-N moieties during pyrolysis, leading to high surface area and high graphitization degree of L-FeNC simultaneously. Benefiting from abundant Fe-N4 active sites, enhanced mass and charge transfer, the as-prepared L-FeNC manifested a half-wave potential of 0.89 V for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in 0.1 M KOH. A maximum power density of 140 mW cm−2 and stable discharge voltage even after operation for 50,000 s have been demonstrated when the L-FeNC was used as air cathode for Zn-air battery. This work not only provided a unique surface-confined strategy for the synthesis of two-dimensional nanocarbons, but also demonstrated the significant benefit from rational design and engineering of Fe-N-C SACs, thus offering great opportunities for fabrication of efficient energy conversion and storage devices.",
