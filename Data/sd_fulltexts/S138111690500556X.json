Graphical abstract Incorporation of a salpr schiff base ligand within the large pores of mesoporous material MCM-41 and subsequent treatment with MoO2(acac)2 affords a new truly heterogeneous molybdenum catalyst for successful epoxidation of cycooctene,cyclohexene,1-octene and 1-hehene with TBHP with high selectivities, turnover frequencies, and stability. The mesoporous molecular sieve MCM-41 was covalently grafted with 3-chloropropyl trimethoxylsilane and was then reacted with N,N′-bis(3-salicylidenaminopropyl)amine(salpr) to afford MCM-41 containing salpr ligand, salpr/Si-MCM-41. Powder X-ray diffraction and nitrogen adsorption–desorption analyses revealed that not only the textural characteristics of the support were preserved during the grafting experiments but also the channels remained accessible despite sequential reduction in surface area, pore volume and pore size. The salpr/Si-MCM-41 material was then reacted with MoO2(acac)2 to give MoO2(salpr)/Si-MCM-41 catalyst with molybdenum loading of 1.75wt.%. The molybdenum-containing MCM-41 was shown to successfully catalyze the epoxidation of 1-hexene, 1-octene, cyclohexene and cyclooctene with tert-butylhydroperoxide (TBHP) quantitatively with 95–99% selectivity toward the corresponding epoxides under mild conditions. Keywords Molybdenum N,N′-bis(3-salicylidenaminopropyl)amine(salpr)MCM-41 Epoxidation Heterogeneous catalyst 1 Introduction Studies of catalytic epoxidation reactions as an important area has attracted many research groups during the past years. These have been based on the fact that these compounds are important intermediates either in laboratory researches or in industries for production in huge tonnages. Using soluble compounds of early transition metal compounds such as Mo, W, Ti and V as homogeneous catalysts for olefin epoxidations have been reported previously [1]. The fundamental role of molybdenum-based catalysts for the production of both bulk and fine chemicals has increased the researchers attentions toward this metal [1,2]. Utilization of bis(acetylacetonato)dioxo-molybdenum (VI) and two types of MoO(O2)2L1L2 and MoO2X2L1L2 complexes as olefin epoxidation catalysts provide successful examples [3–5]. Dioxomolybdenum (VI) complexes of tetradentate Schiff bases [6], dichloro and dimethyldioxo Mo (VI) diazabutadiene were reported as active epoxidation catalysts [7]. Despite good results obtained with soluble Mo complexes, many attempts have been made to develope the heterogeneous systems. Grafting Mo compounds to functionalized polymer supports [8,9], preparation of amorphous Mo silicates via sol–gel method [10,11] and incorporation of Mo in the framework of silicalite are examples in this regard [12]. Micelle-templated inorganic oxides of silica and alumina have emerged in the past decade as very promising support materials owing to their unique textural properties (high surface area, pore volume and narrow pore size distribution) [13–17]. Jia and Thiel modified the micelle-templated silica MCM-41 with a bidentate pyrazolylpyridine ligand and prepared a covalently anchored complex of MoO(O)2(L-L) types [18,19]. It was found that this hybrid catalyst was active for epoxidation of cyclooctene. Mo complexes of MoO2Cl2(L1)(L2) type have also been immobilized within MCM-41 functionalized with monodentate nitrile and bidentate bipyridyl ligands [20,21]. Moreover, functionalization of MCM-41 and MCM-48 with a bidentate 1,4-diazabutadiene ligand and complexation with molybdenum resulted in a more stable catalyst for olefin epoxidation [22]. In this study, we have attempted to prepare and characterize a new stable and recyclable heterogeneous catalyst of molybdenum with covalent attachment of a tetradentate Schiff base ligand, salpr, to MCM-41 and subsequent complaxation of MoO2(acac)2 with supported ligand for epoxidation of olefins. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of catalyst 2.1.1 Preparation of MCM-41 and chloropropyl modified MCM-41 (Clp/Si-MCM-41) Mesoporous molecular sieve MCM-41 was prepared according to reported method [23]. Modification of the prepared MCM-41 was performed as followed: MCM-41 (4g) was suspended in dry toluene (70ml) and then chloropropyl trimethoxysilane (4g, Merck) was added under dry nitrogen atmosphere and the mixture was refluxed for 6h. The solid was filtered, washed with dichloromethane and ethanol and dried. It was then soxhlet extracted with a mixture of ethanol and dichloromethane (1:1) to remove the silylating reagent residue and was vacuum dried at 473K. Characterization of Clp/Si-MCM-41 was performed using FT-IR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. 2.1.2 Preparation of salpr/Si-MCM-41 The salpr ligand was prepared according to the reported method [24]. For preparation of salpr modified MCM-41 [25], Clp/Si-MCM-41 (2g) was suspended in 90ml of benzene and to this mixture was added excess of salpr ligand (1g, 3.2mmol) and triethylamine (0.5ml) and refluxed for 12h. The solid was filtered, dried and then soxhlet extracted with ethanol and dried under vacuum at 473K. The prepared salpr/Si-MCM-41 material was characterized with FT-IR spectroscopy and BET nitrogen sorption studies. 2.1.3 Preparation of MoO2-(salpr)/Si-MCM-41 For preparation of MoO2(salpr) modified MCM-41(MoO2-salpr/Si-MCM-41), excess MoO2(acac)2 (500mg, 1.5mmol) prepared according to the literature method [26], was dissolved in ethanol (50ml). salpr/Si-MCM-41 (1g, dried in vacuum oven at 473K) was then added to this solution and the mixture was refluxed for 12h. After filtration, the product was dried and then soxhlet extracted with a mixture of dichloromethane and ethanol (1:1) to remove unreacted MoO2(acac)2. MoO2-salpr/Si-MCM-41 was then dried under vacuum at 473K and characterized with FT-IR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and BET nitrogen sorption studies. 2.2 Instrumentation Infrared spectra were recorded using Shimadzu 4300 FT-IR spectrometer. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected with a SIEFERT XRD 3003 PTS diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. Chemical analysis of samples was carried out with Perkin-Elmer atomic absorption spectrometer. Nitrogen sorption studies were performed at liquid nitrogen temperature using Quantachrome Nova 2200, Version 7.11 Analyzer. 2.3 Catalytic epoxidation Epoxidation of olefins such as cyclohexene, cyclooctene, 1-hexene and 1-octene purchased from Merck was carried out in a 25ml round-bottomed flask equipped with a condenser and a magnetic stirrer. Tert-butylhydroperoxide (TBHP) (obtained from Merck as 80% in di-tertiary butyl peroxide) was used as oxidant. In a typical procedure, to a mixture of catalyst (200mg) and olefin (8mmol) in chloroform (20ml) was added TBHP (1.6ml, 14.4mmol) under nitrogen atmosphere and the mixture was refluxed for appropriate time. Samples were withdrawn periodically and after dilution with chloroform and cooling were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (HP, Agilent 68909N) equipped with a capillary column (HP-5) and a FID detector. Products were quantified using isooctane (1g, 8.75mmol, Merck) as internal standard. GC-MS of products were recorded using a Shimadzu-14A fitted with a capillary column (CBP5-M25). The molybdenum content of recycled catalyst was measured with above mentioned atomic absorption spectrometer after dissolution of the solid in hydrogen fluoride solution. 3 Results and discussions 3.1 Preparation of the catalyst The catalyst was prepared using the standard reaction for the surface modification of mesoporous materials i.e. reaction of surface silanol groups of MCM-41 with alkoxy silanes (in this work, chloropropyl trimethoxysilane) and subsequent reaction with chelate ligand, salpr. In this reaction, the chloro group of Si-MCM-41 is replaced with the secondary amine group of salpr ligand. The ligand supported MCM-41 then reacts with MoO2(acac)2 to afford a heterogenized homogeneous catalyst i.e. MoO2-salpr/Si-MCM-41 (Scheme 1 ). That the multidentate schiff base, salpr, was bound to the surface of modified MCM-41 was confirmed by FT-IR spectroscopy and nitrogen sorption studies. In the FT-IR spectrum of MoO2-salpr/Si-MCM-41 (Fig. 1(a)), a new band at 1635cm−1 is assigned to CN stretching vibration of salpr ligand [24], and some weak bands at 1400–1500cm−1 belong to stretching vibrations of aromatic rings which are not observed in either MCM-41 or Si-MCM-41. Upon reaction of salpr ligand with MoO2(acac)2, the band located at 1635cm−1 is shifted to lower frequency (1620cm−1) (Fig. 1(b)) indicating complexation of CN group of supported ligand with molybdenum. The appearance of two adjacent bands at 902 and 947cm−1 in the FT-IR spectrum of complexed material is also characteristics of the presence of cis-MoO2 group [27] and formation of MoO2-salpr/Si-MCM-41 material. Atomic absorption spectroscopy showed 1.75wt.% of molybdenum in the MoO2-salpr/Si-MCM-41 catalyst. This quantity was obtained after 24h soxhlet extraction of product obtained from reaction of MoO2(acac)2 with salpr/Si-MCM-41. Thus any impregnated molybdenum in this material is negligible. 3.2 X-ray diffraction studies Textural properties of resulted molybdenum catalyst were investigated with XRD. X-ray diffraction patterns of prepared MCM-41, Clp-MCM-41 and MoO2-salpr/Si-MCM-41 are presented in Fig. 2(a)–(c). X-ray diffraction pattern of unmodified MCM-41 (Fig. 2(a)) consists of a strong reflection at 2θ =2.71° assigned to the 100 reflection and three weaker reflection at higher angles that can be assigned to the 110, 200 and 210 reflections of a hexagonal unit cell. The hexagonal unit cell parameter, a 0 (or lattice parameter), a measure of spacing between the hexagonal layers is calculated as the d 100 (2/√3). For the unmodified MCM-41, this parameter is 37.6Å (Table 1 ). The XRD pattern for the chloropropyl modified MCM-41 (Fig. 2(b)) also shows the strong (100) reflection as well as two weak reflections (110 and 200) at higher angles. Compared to MCM-41, the intensities of peaks decrease and shift to lower angles (higher d-values). The lattice parameter for this material is 38.06Å (Table 1) and increases with respect to MCM-41 indicating expansion of unit cell due to incorporation of chloropropyl groups within MCM-41. In the XRD pattern of supported molybdenum catalyst, MoO2-salpr /Si-MCM-41 (Fig. 2(c)), the 100 reflection is only present and shifts to lower angle (or higher d-value). The lattice parameter for this material is 38.3Å (Table 1) and increases with respect to MCM-41 and ClpMCM-41 due to the incorporation of bulky group MoO2-salpr and expansion of unit cell. Lower intensity of the peak 100 for MoO2-salpr/Si-MCM-41 is likely due to decrease of surface uniformity in this material with respect to MCM-41 and Si-MCM-41. 3.3 Nitrogen sorption studies Nitrogen sorption isotherms of MCM-41, salpr/Si-MCM-41 and MoO2-salpr /Si-MCM-41 are shown in Fig. 3(a)–(c). These materials all show the type IV isotherms in the IUPAC classification with the appearance of hysteresis loop resulted from capillary condensation of nitrogen gas in mesopores. For unmodified MCM-41, the step corresponding to capillary condensation appears in the relative pressure ranges 0.2–0.4 (Fig. 3(a)). The specific surface area and total pore volume of prepared MCM-41 are 1211m2 g−1 and 0.852cm3 g−1, respectively (Table 2 ). The isotherms of salpr/Si-MCM-41 and MoO2-salpr/Si-MCM-41 (Fig. 3(b) and (c)) show a lower nitrogen uptake pointing out to a decrease of specific surface area and pore volume (Table 2) due to incorporation of salpr and MoO2-salpr group in MCM-41. An interesting object in comparing BET results of salpr/Si-MCM-41 and MoO2-salpr/Si-MCM-41 is that the surface area of MoO2-salpr/Si-MCM-41 is higher than salpr/Si-MCM-41 (Table 2). This is explained with contraction of aromatic arms of salpr ligands due to complexation of salpr/Si-MCM-41 with molybdenum (Scheme 1). We also observed a broader hysteresis loops for these materials (Fig. 3(b) and (c)) with respect to MCM-41 because of a probable decrease of uniformity in pore size. 3.4 Catalytic activity The catalytic activity of the prepared MoO2-salpr/Si-MCM-41 was evaluated through epoxidation of the aforementioned olefins. The optimum reaction time for cyclooctene was obtained from the study of olefin conversion percentage at different times (Fig. 4 ). 1-Octene and 1-hexene oxidations were carried out at twenty hours in order to obtain similar conversion percentages. The conversions and selectivities as well as turnover frequencies (TOFs) (mmol of product formed per mmol of molybdenum in catalyst) are given in Table 3 . We have included the tests with blank (without catalyst) and MCM-41 (without complex) in Table 3, in order to make the comparison more convenient. As seen, the conversion percentages of cyclooctene has drastically increase from 14 (blank) and 21 (MCM-41) to 99 in the presence of MoO2-(salpr)/Si-MCM-41 catalyst. It is evident that compared to linear olefins, cyclohexene and cyclooctene show higher reactivity and TOF although similar selectivites toward the corresponding epoxides are obtained. The different behavior between linear and cyclic alkenes might be inferred if one considers the reaction mechanism. On the basis of our previously reported mechanism [12], epoxidation of cyclohexene and trans-2-hexene-1-ol with TBHP catalyzed by molybdenum-incorporated silicalite proceed through the peroxo intermediate and concerted oxygen atom transfer to the olefin [7,28]. Based on the experimental and theoretical investigations reported very recently, epoxidation of some olefins in the presence of bis(halogeno)dioxomolybdenum(VI)–diimine complexes as catalyst was indicated to involve the transfer of a TBHP proton to the terminal oxygen atom of one of the MoO groups and coordination of t-BuOO− to the Lewis acidic metal center and formation of the peroxo intermediate in the first step [28]. With the similar mechanism depicted in Scheme 2 , it can be seen that the approach of either cyclohexene or cyclooctene to the catalyst center take place faster with respect to the linear 1-hexene and 1-octene olefins with terminal double bonds since in cyclic olefins, the internal double bonds located between secondary carbons enjoy richer electron densities. Moreover, while the cis-double bond either in cyclohexene or cyclooctene bears bonds consisting of CH2 groups and therefore feels less steric crowding in approaching to metal center, the 1-hexene and 1-octene with alkyl chain in the vicinity of double bond suffer more steric repulsion near the oxidation center. The stability of the MoO2-salpr/Si-MCM-41 catalyst was studied by recycling the recovered catalyst and determination of metal content using atomic absorption spectroscopy. The molybdenum content of recovered catalyst was shown to be 1.73wt.% with little change with respect to initial catalyst. The recovered catalyst was used again in epoxidation of cyclooctene with TBHP. As shown in the last entry of Table 3, minor decrease in conversion and TOF percentages were observed although selectivity remains unchanged. With this result and observation of no desorption, the presence of affixed Mo complex within MCM-41 is confirmed. It can be concluded that the catalytic epoxidation is truly heterogeneous in nature. 4 Conclusion Our work has revealed that incorporation of a multidentate schiff base ligand such as salpr within the large pores of mesoporous material Si-MCM-41 and subsequent treatment with MoO2(acac)2 affords a new highly stable and heterogeneous molybdenum catalyst for epoxidation of olefins with high turnover frequencies and selectivities.
