(Received November 20, 1986; accepted July 25, 1988) Summary Catalysts obtained by interacting T^CH^C^s)* or Zr(7r-C3H5)4 with the surface of SiOy, and treated with hydrogen possess a very high activity with respect to hydrogenation of benzene and cyclohexene. This activity is commensurable with that of supported Group VIII metals. The catalysts were studied by chemisorption, thermodesorption and EXAFS methods, and were shown to contain anchored hydride complexes of Ti and Zr, whose content can be controlled by varying the temperature of their treatment with hydrogen. A quantitative correlation exists between the specific activity of the catalysts under consideration in hydrogenation reactions and the content of hydride complexes in these catalysts. Introduction Catalysts containing surface hydride complexes of Group IVB transi- tion metals (Eiv) are active in olefin polymerization [1, 2] and olefin hydrogenation [3, 4]. Complexes with Eiv H bonds are formed on the surfaces of oxide supports upon heating anchored organometallic complexes of Ti, Zr or Hf under vacuum or hydrogen atmosphere [1, 2]. It has been found recently [5] that catalysts with surface Ti hydrides are very active with respect to benzene and cyclohexene hydrogenations. The specific activity of these catalysts is commensurable with that of sup- ported Group VIII metals, and particularly with the activity of Ni/SiO;. Surface hydrides of Group IVB transition metals are precursors of active sites of olefin polymerization [6-8], but their role in hydrogenation is not clear as yet, because the hydrogenation may be expected to occur also on low-valent Eiv ions formed via decomposition of anchored organo- metallic complexes. In this work, in order to determine the nature of the active sites in Fiv/SiOa catalysts (Eiv = Ti or Zr) that are responsible for \" \"Author deceased. 0304-6102/88/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 122 benzene and cyclohexene hydrogenations, we compared the rates of these reactions with the content of Eiy H bonds in the catalysts, and also exam- ined the state of Eiy and the local coordination of Zr. Experimental Catalyst preparation Catalysts were prepared by treating silica (250 m2 g~1) dehydrated in vacuum at 873 K with a pentane solution of Ti(CH2CeH5)4 or Zr(7r-C3H5)4. The treatment was followed by washing the residues of unreacted complexes with pentane and by removal of the solvent by evacuation at 298 K. At this step of the preparation, the following reaction occurs [1, 2]: ra(^Si-OH) + EivR4 y ($Si-0),.ER4_,. + nRH t (1) where $Si OH are surface hydroxyl groups of SiO;, Eiy = Ti or Zr, R = CHaCfiHs and ir-CyHsfor Ti and zr. respectively. The catalysts were then treated with hydrogen at 423 - 873 K. At this step the removal of organic ligands, formation of surface hydride complexes of Ti or Zr [1, 2], and partial reduction of E^y ions to lower oxidation states [9] occur. All procedures of catalyst preparation and study were performed without contact with air. Thermodesorption measurements These were carried out in a high-vacuum static reactor furnished with a mass spectrometer. The samples, pretreated with hydrogen at a definite temperature, were placed in the reactor, and then were outgassed to 10~7 torr and heated to 873 K at a rate of 5 K muf1. The organic products desorbed (mainly benzene and toluene in the case of Ti/SiOz and propane in the case of Zr/SiO^) resulting from decomposition of organic ligand residues were frozen out with liquid nitrogen. The desorbed gaseous prod- ucts were predominantly hydrogen with methane impurities (in the case of Ti/SiC 2 no more than 5 -10 vol.% CH4). The total amount of hydrogen evolved was calculated relative to the content of Ti or Zr in the catalysts. Benzene hydrogenation This was performed in a glass static reactor (with circulation) at 423 K (on Ti/SiOz) or 363 K (on Zr/SiO;) at C6He and H, pressures of 50 and 300 torr, respectively. The reaction was followed by the measuring pressure drop of the reaction mixture; the products were analyzed chromatograph- ically. Cyclohexene hydrogenation This was performed in a similar reactor at 298 K and pressures of CfiHio, H2 and Ar of 50, 150 and 500 torr, respectively. The activities of 123 both reactions were calculated from the initial linear portion of the 'com- position us. time' curve at a conversion of <10%. Adsorption measurements These were carried out using a flow pulse system with a chromato- graphic analysis. The reduced samples were evacuated at the reduction temperature at 10~3 ton, and the amount of the oxygen adsorbed was then measured at 298 - 873 K. EXAFS X-ray spectra at the K-edge of zirconium absorption were taken using synchrotron radiation of the storage ring VEPP-4, installed in the Institute of Nuclear Physics of the Siberian Division of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences, by the method described in [10]. Spectra were analyzed over the range from 3.8-12.0 A~1 as described in [10]. The accuracy of the determination of the positions of coordination maxima was 0.06 A. Coordi- nation numbers were not determined because of the presence of the third order in the radiation spectrum of the storage ring. Results Study of the state ofE^ ions in catalysts Hydrogen content in catalysts Figure 1 illustrates the dependence of the quantity of desorbed hydro- gen, calculated relative to the content of Ti or Zr in the catalysts, on the temperature of prereduction. In the case of the Ti/SiO; catalyst reduced at 423 K, more than two hydrogen atoms are desorbed from each titanium ion. The amount of the desorbed hydrogen monotonically decreases almost to zero with increasing temperature of the catalyst reduction to 873 K 0 473 Reduction 673 873 temperature K. Fig. 1.

The amount of the desorbed hydrogen agrees within an accuracy of 20% with the amount of hydrogen in Ti/SiO; determined by the method of deuterium exchange [5]. An analogous dependence is observed for the Zr/Si02 catalyst (Fig. 1, curve 2), but at the same temperatures of reduction the content of hydrogen in this catalyst is 1.5 - 2 times lower than that in Ti/SiO;. The content of H^ in the products of desorption of Kiv/SiO; catalysts not subjected to hydrogen pretreatment is at least one order of magnitude smaller in comparison with the reduced samples. Thus, the amount of H2 formed during dehydrogenation of organic ligands that occur upon thermo- desorption has little effect on the total amount of desorbed hydrogen. This fact indicates that the total amount of desorbed hydrogen is due to hydride complexes of titanium and zirconium, whose content in the catalysts tends to decrease with increasing temperature of reduction. Oxidation state of Ti and Zr ions (Table 1) The Ti/SiOa catalysts reduced at 423 and 573 K adsorb oxygen in amounts 0/Ti = 1.37 and 0.92, respectively, (atomic ratio) at 298 K, and as a result are decolourized due to the oxidation of titanium ions to Ti4\"1\". A rise of oxidation temperature to 673 K is accompanied by a negligible increase in the amount of the adsorbed oxygen in comparison with adsorp- tion at 298 K (Table 1). From the amount of oxygen consumed for the complete oxidation of E^/SiO; at 673 - 873 K (0/Eiy), a mean oxidation number of Eiv(\") in the initial catalyst can be calculated by eqn. (I): n = 4 20/Eiv + H/Eiv (1) The addend in eqn. (1) allows a correction for the oxygen consumed for the titration of Eiv H complexes. The calculated values of n for the Ti/SiO; catalysts reduced at 423 and 573 are 3.4 and 3.0, respectively. The Ti/SiOz sample reduced at 873 K absorbs oxygen in amounts 0/Ti = 0.70 at 873 K. The estimated value of n for this sample is 2.7, which indicates the presence of some Ti2* ions, along with Ti3\"1\" ions in it. On increasing the reduction temperature, the mean oxidation number in the Zr/SiO; system calculated via eqn. (1) decreases from 3.4 to 3.2. EXAFS data The X-ray spectra at the K-edge of zirconium absorption for Zr/SiO; catalysts are shown in Fig. 2. Figure 3 illustrates the radial distribution of atoms (RDA) around the ionized zirconium atom which have been obtained by Fourier transform of the oscillating structure of the spectra. All RDA curves have peaks at (R 6,-) s 1.0 A, the position and intensity of which depend largely upon the spectra treatment procedure. Consequently, all these peaks are spurious, in other words, are caused by errors in isolation and analysis of the fine structure of X-ray spectra (in particular, by incorrect application of Fourier analysis to this region (R 6;)). The spurious maxima on the RDA curves are indicated by asterisks (*). The intensity of the 126 I a u 2468 2468 -300 0300600900E,eV 024680246 8(R-Si)A Fig. 2.

RDA curves for 5.2% Zr/SiO^ catalysts. Numbers of the curves correspond to those in Fig. 2. maxima at (R 6;) > 4 A corresponds to the noise level. Most probable assignments of the coordination maxima to bond lengths, with corrections for phase shifts (6zr_o = 0.48 A and 5zr-zr = 0-24 A) [II], are listed in Table 2. On the RDA curve of the non-reduced Zr/SiO^ catalyst (Fig. 3, curve 1) the coordination peak at (R 6,) = 1.62 A can be attributed to the Zr 0 bond of zirconium with the oxygen of SiO^ [12]. It seems likely that the Zr C distance between the zirconium atom and carbon atoms of allyl ligands contributes to the coordination maximum at (R 8,) = 1.62 A of the non-reduced Zr/SiO; catalyst. The length of this bond (2.10 A after correction for 5,) is close to the metal-carbon distance in a series of Tr-allyl complexes of transition metals of the second period, e.g. in (7r-C3H5PdCl)2 (2.1 A) [13]. According to PMR data [14], in the molecule of Zr(ir-C3H5)4 all allyl groups are equivalent and are symmetrically bonded with the zir- conium atom. Therefore it can be assumed that in the surface Zr complex all Zr C distances are also equivalent. Moreover, the experimental data on allyl metal complexes indicate that the M C distance deviation in them is 0.08 A [18], which is beyond the accuracy of the EXAFS method. The intensities of the subsequent coordination peaks (Fig. 3, curve 1) are close to the noise level, which makes their accurate interpretation quite difficult. A peak at (R 5,-) =2.48 A can be attributed to the Zr O Si distance in the anchored Tr-allyl complex. The corresponding peaks were attributed to Zr 0 Zr and Zr^O Si distances on the basis of experimental data on Zr 0 and Zr 0 M distances and also characteristic values of Si 0 distances and Zr 0 M angles. All RDA curves of the Zr/SiO; catalysts reduced with H^ at 423 - 873 K show a peak at (R 5;) = 1.48 0.02 A, which has been attributed to the 127 TABLE 2 Positions of the coordination maxima of RDA curves (Fig. 3) and their assignment to the bond lengths No. of the curve in Fig. 3 Temperature of reduction (K) (R,-(A) - ,) S, (X) ^(A) Assignment 1.62 0.48 2.10 Zr-0 1 nonreduced 1.62 0.48 2.10 Zr-C 2.48 0.48 2.96 Zr Si ^0^ 1.50 0.48 1.98 Zr-0 2 423 2.48 0.48 2.96 Zr^ /Si 573 3.08 1.46 2.48 1.48 0.24 0.48 0.48 0.48 3.32 1.94 2.96 1.96 0 Zrs. /Zr 0 Zr-0 Zr^Si 873 Zr-0 Zr 0 (1.96 A with correction for the phase shift) distance in the surface Zr complex. There are two known modifications of zirconium oxide, namely monoclinic and cubic ZrOz. The Zr 0 distance of 1.96 0.02 A observed corresponds to neither of the modifications. This distance is too short for the cubic modification; regarding the monoclinic ZrO;, a set of distances should have given a far broader peak than that observed in our case. For the catalyst reduced at 423 K (Fig. 3, curve 2), a peak at (R 5,.) = 3.08 A seems to belong to the distance between zirconium ions bound through bridge oxygen. The ratio between coordination numbers for Zr 0 and Zr O Zr distances is close to 3:1. This ratio corresponds best to the structure in which the zirconium ion is in a tetrahedral surrounding of oxygen ions and hydride anions, the zirconium ions being bound through bridge oxygen atoms to give dimers. An increase in the temperature of reduction of the catalysts diminishes the amplitude of the maxima at (R 6,) = 3.08 A to the value comparable to the noise level (Fig. 3, curves 3 and 4), which may be caused by the dissociation of dimeric hydride com- plexes of zirconium. It should be mentioned that the dissociation of the surface rhenium trimers, obtained by interacting [Re(OC2H5)3]3 with silica, during the course of the high-temperature treatment has been observed earlier [15]. Thus, in catalysts reduced at 573 - 873 K the isolated zirconium ions bound with the oxygen of the support are prevailing. Note that the Zr H 128 bonds cannot be observed by EXAFS because the photoelectron scattering on hydrogen atoms is insignificant. Catalytic properties ofE^/SiO^ Ti/SiO^ The dependences of the catalytic properties of Biv/SiO; catalysts on the temperature of their hydrogen treatment are shown in Table 1. The Ti/SiO; catalysts were found to be very active with respect to benzene hydrogenation. When reduced with hydrogen at 423 K, the catalyst had a specific activity of 0.02 s~1. This value is close to the specific activity of the supported Pd/SiO^ catalyst, which is about 0.1 s~1 under identical conditions [16]. On increasing the reduction temperature to 873 K, the specific activity of the Ti/SiO; catalyst falls by more than one order of magnitude. In the hydrogenation of cyclohexene at 298 K, the specific activity of the Ti/SiO; catalyst reduced at 423 K is 0.6 s~1. Note for comparison that the specific activity of the Pt/SiOa catalyst in this reaction is 2.0 s~1 (295 K, ^\"c^Hio = 75 torr) [17]. When the reduction temperature of Ti/SiO; is raised to 873 K, the activity falls by a factor of 30, as in benzene hydrogenation. Zr/SiO^ The specific activity of the Zr/SiC>2 catalyst, reduced with hydrogen at 423 K with respect to benzene hydrogenation at 363 K is 0.02 s~1 (to be compared with 3.3 X 10~3 s~1 for Pd/Si02 under the same conditions [16]). Thus, in our conditions Zr/SiO; is six times more active than Pd/SiOa. In addition, Zr/SiO; is far more active than Ti/SiO;, since at nearly the same activities of these samples the reaction temperature for the former is 60 K lower. However, as for Ti/SiO;, the activity of Zr/SiO; also tends to fall drastically with increasing reduction temperature. In contrast, in cyclohexene hydrogenation the specific activity of Zr/SiC>2 reduced at 423 K is one order of magnitude smaller than that of Ti/SiO;. Also, with increasing reduction temperature the activity of Zr/SiO^ with respect to cyclohexene hydrogenation monotonically decreases. The only benzene hydrogenation product observed on both catalysts was cyclohexane. The absence of cyclohexene in the products seems to be due to the fact that the rate of its hydrogenation is some orders of magni- tude higher than that of benzene. Discussion State of Ti and Zr ions in E^y/SiO-^ The presence of surface Ti H and Zr H complexes in reduced Eiy/ SiO; catalysts was shown earlier by means of IR spectroscopy [1, 2]. In this work the amount of such hydride complexes was determined. As sug- 129 gested by thermodesorption data, hydride hydrogen in Ti/SiOa and Zr/SiO; reduced at 423 K accounts for approximately 1.5-2 atoms of hydrogen per ion of Ely (Fig. 1). The mean oxidation number of Ti and Zr in these sam- ples determined from 0; adsorption is n = 3, 4. The latter is in agreement with ESR data that indicate the presence of isolated Ti3\"1\" and Zr3\"1\" ions, comprising ~10 - 20% of the total amount of supported metals, in Eiy/ SiC>2 catalysts reduced at 423 K [9]. The process of formation of Ti hydride complexes upon treatment with H; at 423 K may be described by the following scheme: ^-0^ ^CH,Ph H, ^-0^ ^H ^ ^H // Ti4* ^ ^ Ti4* + ^-0-Ti3* + ^ ^CH,Ph 423K |-0^ ^H ^ ^H / /' + CHaPh (2) The literature [1, 2, 5 - 9] and our data suggest that the process of formation of Zr hydride complexes upon treatment with H; at 423 K may follow the analogous scheme: ^T0^ H, ^-0. ^-0. ^H ^ >r^(C3H^ ^ ^ ^Zr^-H + ^ >r^ + ^-0\" 423K ^-0 ^-0^ ^H y / / + CaHg (3) The most probable structures of the surface complexes Fiv/SiO^ at different reduction temperatures are shown in Table 1. An increase in reduction temperature of Ery/SiOa systems leads to a sharp fall of the content of Eiy H complexes in them, as well as to addi- tional reduction of Eiy ions. The Fiv/SiO; catalysts treated with hydrogen at 873 K contain predominantly Ti3'1' and Zr3\"1\" ions which are not bound with hydrogen. The oxidation states obtained from 0; adsorption data are supported by ESCA data. The binding energy (E^) of Ti 2p3/z for the Ti/SiO; sample treated with hydrogen at 873 K is 459.5 eV, which is almost the same as E^ of Ti3* in TiCIa [19]. According to high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) data [19], upon supporting tetrabenzyltitanium or tetraallylzirconium on Sic; and further reducing with H; at 573 - 873 K the morphology of silica remains nearly unchanged. This is evidence that neither three-dimensional disperse particles of oxides nor extended two-dimensional surface com- pounds of titanium or zirconium are present in these samples. In this work, we have obtained direct evidence by EXAFS methods that all Zr/SiOa catalysts contain surface zirconium ions bound with the oxygen of the support. The catalyst reduced at 423 K seems to have dimeric hydride complexes of zirconium chemically bound with the oxygen of SiO;. Note 130 that despite a rather low oxidation number of Zr, the Zr 0 distance ob- served (1.96 A) is considerably shorter than in the known modifications of ZrO; and Zr silicates [12]. This allows us to assert that there are no particles of bulk Zr oxides in the system studied. Rather, surface species are formed, in which the oxygen surrounding the Zr is partially substituted by hydride anions. However, we are unaware of any individual molecular analogs to these surface compounds. In the samples treated with hydrogen at 573 - 873 K, the peaks of the subsequent coordination spheres of zirconium are weak, which indicates the absence of heavy elements, namely Zr atoms, in the second coordination sphere of an ionizing atom. This fact allows us to conclude that the Zr/SiO; catalysts reduced at 573 - 873 K have predom- inantly isolated zirconium ions bound with the surface oxygen of SiO;. This conclusion is in agreement with the high resolution electron microscopy data, indicating the absence of finely dispersed particles of oxides and other zirconium compounds in the catalysts under consideration. Thus, the Fiv/SiOz catalysts treated with hydrogen contain Ti H and Zr H complexes chemically bound with the surface oxygen of the support (Table 1). The concentrations of these complexes in the catalysts can be controlled by varying the temperature of their reduction. Correlation between the content of E^ H complexes in the catalysts and their activity with respect to hy drogena tion We have found that anchored hydride complexes of titanium and zirconium show very high catalytic activities in benzene and cyclohexene hydrogenation which are comparable with the activities of Group VIII supported metals under otherwise identical conditions. Fez and Crisey [20] reported the hydrogenation of benzene in the presence of bulk hydrides of Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb, La and V. It is known that benzene hydrogenation occurs readily in the presence of solutions of transition metal complexes, including those of titanium [21 - 24]. It was assumed [21, 24] that precursors of active sites of homogeneous hydrogenation of benzene are mononuclear hydride complexes of transition elements. From a comparison of the dependences of activities (Table 1) and con- tents of hydride hydrogen in the catalysts on their reduction temperature, it follows that the specific activity of Fiv/SiOa catalysts towards hydrogena- tion is in quantitative agreement with the content of Eiv H complexes in the catalysts (Figs. 4 and 5). The dependence of the specific activity on the concentration of Eiv H complexes in the catalysts can be described by a simple low-power equation: A=fe[Eiv-H]'\" (4) In cyclohexene hydrogenation (Fig. 4), the activity is proportional to the content of Eiv H complexes in the catalysts. A linear correlation between the activity in the hydrogenation and the content of the Eiv H complexes suggests that either all surface complexes having a Ti H (or Zr H) bond, or 131 0 05 10 15 H/Tl 0 05 10 15 H/Zr 0 05 10 15 H/Tl 0 05 10 15 M/Zr Hydrogen content in the catalysts Mycfrogen content in the catalysts Fig. 4.

(1) 1.1% Ti/SiOz, (2) 5.2% Zr/SiO,. a portion of the hydride complexes which is constant relative to their total amount, are active sites of hydrogenation. Low-valent titanium and zirconium ions, nonbound to hydrogen, are inactive with respect to the hydrogenation (Table 1). Regarding benzene hydrogenation, the dependence of the activity on the content of E^y H complexes in the catalyst is non- linear (Fig. 5). The values of exponent m in eqn. (4) are 1.7 and 2.8 for Ti/SiO; and Zr/SiO;, respectively, which means that two or three neigh- bouring surface hydride complexes, having a sufficient number of hydrogen atoms for the complete hydrogenation of CeHg, take part in the hydrogena- tion of one benzene molecule. Support for this conclusion comes from EXAFS data indicating the presence of anchored dimeric hydride com- plexes of zirconium in the Zr/SiO; catalysts reduced at 423 K. The mechanism of benzene hydrogenation on anchored hydride com- plexes of Ti and Zr appears to be similar to that of homogeneous hydro- genation in solutions of the complexes of these elements [21 - 24], which includes the consecutive addition of hydrogen atoms to the molecule of benzene, leading to the formation of TT-complexes bound with the atom of the transition element. Additional investigations are necessary for an under- standing of the mechanism of benzene hydrogenation on surface Ejy H complexes. References 1 V. A. Zakharov, V. K. Dudchenko, E. A. Paukshtis, L.

Catalysts obtained by interacting Ti(CH2C6H5)4 or Zr(π-C3H5)4 with the surface of SiO2 and treated with hydrogen possess a very high activity with respect to hydrogenation of benzene and cyclohexene. This activity is commensurable with that of supported Group VIII metals. The catalysts were studied by chemisorption, thermodesorption and EXAFS methods, and were shown to contain anchored hydride complexes of Ti and Zr, whose content can be controlled by varying the temperature of their treatment with hydrogen. A quantitative correlation exists between the specific activity of the catalysts under consideration in hydrogenation reactions and the content of hydride complexes in these catalysts.
