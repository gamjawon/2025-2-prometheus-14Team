The process evolved three general stages. In the induction period carbon was dissolved into the Ni particles as evidenced by in situ X-ray powder diffraction measurements. This promoted the formation of large metal particles pear-shaped in Ni catalysts and quasi-octahedral in Ni-Cu ones. The steady-state growth of the filaments occurred on the second stage. Finally, the catalyst was deactivated producing porous granules composed of interlaced long carbon filaments. In deacti- vated Ni catalysts the nickel was found in metal state, while in Ni-Cu samples about half of the nickel was atomically dispersed in carbon as revealed by extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. The deactivation of the catalysts was suggested to include the fragmentation of the metal particles as well as an atomic erosion in Ni-Cu samples. In addition, in both catalysts the filaments growth could also be limited when the close-packed structures of porous carbon were achieved.

Introduction Methane conversion, e.g. steam reforming, as an important industrial process has been investigated intensively for many years. One of the main problems in these catalytic reactions is the carbon formation which is generally considered to poison the catalyst. In some cases the carbon was found as filaments grown out of the metal (Ni or Fe) particles (for instance, see Ref. [1]). This carbon deposition occurs without blocking the metal surfaces responsible for the decomposition of the carbon-containing gas, hence, the lifetime of the catalyst could be increased. However, the accumulation of significant amounts of the carbon can create some operational problems in the reactors. Therefore, investi- gations are usually aimed to reduce the carbon deposition, e.g. by additives like sulphur. Nevertheless, we believe that the formation of filamentous carbon could be suggested as a desired process. Such a carbon has a porous structure and could be considered for commercial application as a highly dispersed carbon support, adsorbent, etc. [2]. In addition, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) pho- tographs showed a variety of morphologies of the deposited carbon [3-6]. Therefore, one can vary the carbon structure and, hence, its chemical and mechanical properties, e.g. in adsorption [7]. Finally, it is very attractive to produce both the filamentous carbon and hydrogen using low temperature methane decomposition. Inspired by this purposes, we have developed Ni catalysts performing this reaction at temperatures of ca. 800-900 K, i.e., about 300 K lower with respect to Fe ones. TEM pictures of carbon deposited on supported Ni catalysts showed that one filament grows out from one metal particle [3-5]. Therefore, we have suggested the more nickel the more carbon. On the other hand, Ni foil and powder are known to be inactive in methane decomposition. Subsequently, the coprecipi- tated Ni-alumina catalysts were synthesized with a high Ni content. In Part I [8] we have investigated the structure of the coprecipitated catalysts in calcined and reduced states. The surface and bulk structure of the catalysts was found to depend on their composition. When Cu was introduced, the Ni-A1 spinel, found in Ni catalysts, was not observed. Moreover, the alumina phase was fragmented and covered the Ni-Cu alloy particle surface enriched with copper. Therefore, introduction of copper is believed to influence the catalytic properties of these catalysts. In this paper carbon deposition on coprecipitated Ni-alumina and Ni-Cu- alumina catalysts and the evolution of the catalyst structure have been investi- gated during the methane decomposition reaction. 2. Experimental The same catalysts as studied in Part I were used for catalytic tests. After reduction in hydrogen at 823 K, passivation was carried out by cooling the L.B. Aedeeva et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 117-129 1 t 9 reactor to 310 K, followed by injection and subsequent flooding the reactor with ethanol. Subsequently, the catalysts were dried in ambient conditions. The catalysts activities were measured in a vibrating flow reactor equipped with temperature controller and heated lines for gas inlet. Methane of 99.99%, H2 of 99.9% and He of 99.9% purity were used. The composition of the outlet gas was determined by gas chromatography. All the measurements were carried out at identical conditions. A catalyst (100 mg) was placed in the quartz reactor and heated in methane flow up to the reaction temperature of 823 K with a rate of 6 K/min. The reaction was performed at atmospheric pressure of methane (100 kPa) and the flow corre- sponded to 120 1/(gcat h). Note, that the reactor volume and flow were chosen to operate in the kinetic region of the reaction, i.e. no gas diffusion limitation was observed. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Siemens URD-63 diffractometer using Cu K a radiation and a graphite crystal monochro- mator. In situ XRD measurements were performed in a high-temperature chamber (HTK-10 Anton Paar) installed in the diffractometer. The passivated catalyst mixed with silicon as an internal standard was placed in the chamber and heated in a 5% H2 + 95% He mixture flow up to 823 K and subsequently was kept at this temperature for one hour. When 50% CH4 + 50% He mixture flow of ca. 5 l/(gcat h) was introduced into the chamber the consecutive XRD patterns were recorded simultaneously. Two diffraction angle regions, 2 0, were investigated in different experiments: 17-32(Si(lll) and C(002) lines) and 73-75(Ni(220) and Si(331) lines). EXAFS spectra of the nickel K-edge were recorded with an EXAFS spec- trometer in the Siberian Center of Synchrotron Radiation (Novosibirsk). The spectra were treated to obtain the radial distribution of atoms (RDA) curve using the common procedure as described elsewhere [8]. TEM pictures were obtained with a JEM-100CX microscope at room temper- ature. The samples passivated in ethanol were ultrasonically dispersed over holly carbon and dried in the vacuum chamber of the microscope. 3. Results 3.1. Ni-alumina catalysts Table 1 summarizes the parameters of the catalysts during methane decompo- sition at 823 K. The reactions were carried out until complete deactivation of the catalysts. The amount of carbon accumulated in the reactor as well as the carbon capacity, Gc , calculated per gram of nickel, were proportional to the Ni content in the Ni-alumina samples, however, the nickel powder (100Ni sample) as expected was deactivated rapidly. Therefore, this relationship reveals a maxi- 120 L.B.

At the conditions chosen (T = 823 K, PCH4 = 100 kPa), the 90Ni catalyst was characterized by both a longer lifetime and higher methane conversion. The global evolution of the reaction is shown in Fig. 1. Three stages are clearly resolved: (i) the induction period, when methane conversion, 77, in- creases; (ii) the steady state, when the 7/ value is constant; (iii) deactivation stage, when conversion falls to zero. We tentatively assumed that each stage was connected with some changes of the catalyst structure. In situ XRD studies of the 75Ni sample showed that during the first 8 min of the reaction the Ni(220) diffraction line (Fig. 2) was shifted to smaller angles. (The same effect was found with the Ni(311) line, not shown in the figure.)

Scan rates were 2rain for Ni(220), and 5min for C(002) regions, respectively. Left and right patterns were recorded with different samples of the same catalysts. accordance with the \"classical\" model [1,9] this shift is likely caused by dissolving of the carbon atoms, produced by methane decomposition, into the Ni particles. Indeed, the carbon atom radius 0.77 A is significantly larger than a o vacancy in the Ni lattice, 0.52 A, therefore, carbon incorporation should increase the lattice parameter and, in turn, decrease the 20 value. The shift, A(20)= - 0.3 found for the Ni(220) line at the 8th minute of the reaction, corresponds o to an increase of the lattice constant by 0.014 A. Note also, that no lines attributed to the nickel carbide structure were found in these measurements. Subsequently, both Ni(220) and Si(311) lines were shifted to higher angles, with Si line broadening and non-resolving due to the overlapping with the Ni(220) one. These \"positive\" shifts were attributed to defocusing of the sample in the diffractometer caused by the formation of filamentous carbon as shown in Fig. 3a. Moreover, the C(002) line was also detected at this time-scale (Fig. 2). It is interesting that after 5 min exposure to the reaction gas, while the graphite (002) line was still not detected in the XRD pattern, the methane-helium flow was replaced by pure helium. This resulted in a fast appearance of the C(002) line. Ex situ XRD studies of the 75Ni samples, taken from the main reactor, showed that the Ni particle size was increasing during the reaction. The nickel Djj~ values were found to be 16.5, 22.5 and 40 nm after 20, 60 and 180 rain of L.B. Al'deet'a et al./ Applied Cutalysis A: General 141 (1996) 117-129 122 U , ~oo..1, Fig. 3.

Note, that heating in hydrogen at 1073 K during two hours resulted in a particle size of ca. 15 nm only. Therefore, the formation of large Ni crystallites in the reaction is likely caused by dissolution of the carbon into the metal. Fig. 3b-3d show the evolution of the catalyst morphology in the reactor. One can see that after 20 min of reaction (Fig. 3b and 3c) filaments have grown from the large particles. Some of them were well faceted (A) while others (B) were found at the earlier stage of the formation of pear-shaped nickel particles. Smaller particles of the original catalyst were also found in these pictures. After one hour of reaction the number of large particles was increased as well as L.B.

Fig. 3a and 3d demonstrate that long filaments are observed mostly growing from the large particles, while only short ones are found on the small particles. The mean particle size measured by TEM after two hours of reaction increased significantly in comparison with the reduced cata- lysts and was equal to 50 and 30 nm, in 90Ni and 57Ni samples, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1, the steady-state prolongation depends on the Ni content. However, the global rate of the carbon deposition, calculated as Gc divided by to,t, did not differ significantly for all Ni samples studied (Table 1). Therefore, the higher carbon capacity found with 90Ni samples must be attributed to the longer lifetime of this catalyst. TEM pictures of the deactivated Ni catalysts generally showed non-faceted particles likely encapsulated by carbon. In addition, EXAFS spectra of these samples were identical to those of bulk nickel. The RDA curves of the 90Ni and 57Ni samples (Fig. 4) indicate the Ni particles to be larger than, at least, 50 A, since the coordination number, N, of the first coordination sphere of nickel is close to that of the metal foil and, moreover, the ratio of N for the first three spheres is equal to 2\" 1 4, i.e., the same as that in the bulk (Table 2). Note also, that the spinel structure observed in the reduced 57Ni catalysts [8] was not found in reaction treated samples. Therefore, the Ni-AI spinel phase appears to be destroyed under the reaction conditions. 3.2. Ni-Cu-alumina catalysts When copper was introduced, the quantitative parameters of the reaction such as carbon capacity, methane conversion and macroscopic rate of carbon deposi- tion were changed significantly (Table I). Moreover, the carbon capacity has a 124 L.B.

Note, that in the best case the Gc value achieves 250 g/g~.~,, which corresponds to 99.6% of carbon purity. So-called \"octopus\" [6] carbon, where a few filaments grow from one particle, were found in samples with more than 9 at.% of Cu, with a particle shape being close to octahedral (Fig. 5). Electron microdiffraction has shown that the graphite layers are oriented perpendicular to the filament axis and parallel to the Ni(111) plane. These data are in agreement with those previously observed by Bernardo et al. [6] in supported Ni-Cu/SiO2 catalysts of steam reforming except that they found the \"octopus\" carbon at a significantly higher copper to nickel bulk atomic ratio, ca. 80%. In general, the evolution of Ni-Cu catalysts was similar to that of Ni ones. However, the catalysts were deactivated after ca. 30 h of reaction, i.e., the lifetime of the catalyst was increased twice. EXAFS spectra of deactivated Fig. 5.

At'deet,a et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 117-129 125 Ni-Cu samples differ dramatically from those of Ni ones. Indeed, the RDA curves show a new peak (Fig. 4). The best fit parameters have been found by assuming two different environments for Ni. One is attributed to Ni in metal crystallites while the other is connected with atomically dispersed Ni, with the Ni-C bond being equal to 1.9 A and a real coordination number of ca. 6. These two states of Ni are more pronounced in the 57Ni-23Cu sample. The above mentioned coordination number ratios in this sample differ a little from those for bulk nickel, hence, the size of the Ni particles is larger than 50 A. However, based on absolute N values, a simple calculation shows that only about 40% of nickel forms metal particles with Ni-Ni bonds. In the 82Ni-8Cu sample part of the nickel is also found in the \"atomic\" state. However, the N ratio differs strongly from that in the bulk. This indicates a very small size of the Ni particles, e.g. as clusters. Therefore, in this sample the metal catalyst is strongly fragmented during the reaction. 4. Discussion The macrokinetic curves presented on Fig. 1 were similar for all Ni catalysts studied, therefore, the mechanism of carbon deposition appears to depend slightly on the Ni content. It generally evolves the induction period, the steady state and the final period of falling activity. An in situ XRD study shows that the carbon atoms, produced by methane decomposition, dissolve into the metal particles and increase the lattice parame- ter of Ni by 0.014 ,~. Based on the linear relationship between the lattice parameter of the Ni-C alloy and the carbon concentration with coefficient of 0.0074 (at.%)-I [10], we have calculated the bulk concentration of carbon in nickel to be ca. 2 at.%, i.e., much higher than 0.1 at.% observed at these temperatures under ambient conditions [11]. Therefore, this saturated carbon-in- nickel state exists only in methane flow when surface carbon atoms can be produced. Indeed, when the methane-helium mixture flow was replaced by pure helium, the dissolved carbon was precipitated immediately as graphite. Subsequently, during the initial 10-20 min of the reaction the first carbon filaments were formed (Fig. 3a-3c). The data show that the steady growth of filamentous carbon occurs mostly on Ni particles of 30-50 nm which are significantly larger than those in the reduced catalyst (5-14 nm [8]). Therefore, only coalesced metal particles do intensively produce the carbon filaments. The sintering of the particles saturated with carbon is likely facilitated by their direct contact in original catalysts with a high Ni content. In addition, the data indicate that particles saturated with carbon can diffuse over the \"support\" (alumina and Ni-A1 spinel frame [8]) in the 57Ni sample which is more related to Ni catalysts supported on alumina. A simple calculation shows that the number of small particles that should be agglomerated to form a large one exceeds 102. We 126 L.B. At:deeca el al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 117-129 believe that such a number of particles could not sinter if the filaments would rapidly grow from the small particles, since the filaments formed would take these particles away from the contact with neighbours. Therefore, it appears that the Ni particles are sintered until the critical size that favours the fbrmation of filamentous carbon is reached, in accordance with the views of Tibbetts [12] who has suggested a minimum filament diameter, below which no filaments would grow. It is very attractive to suggest that this kind of metal sintering includes the quasi-liquid state of metal, similar to a recent observation by in situ TEM in the reaction of amorphous carbon and iron at mild temperatures [13]. Possibly, small Ni crystallites, supersaturated with carbon, could partially melt at these temperatures and coalesce like a quasi-liquid. At present, we cannot confirm or reject this mechanism. The TEM study of Ni and Ni-Cu catalysts reacted with methane clearly showed that the shape of the metal particles and the carbon morphology were dramatically changed when only 9 at.% of Cu has been introduced. Despite the graphite layers are parallel to the Ni(111) plane in both cases, carbon filaments are formed by the stacked cones of curved basal planes and grow from pear-shaped particles in Ni catalysts, while the graphite layers are oriented perpendicular to the axis of the fibers grown from quasi-spherical particles in Ni-Cu ones. To date it is difficult to explain the genesis of the metal particle shape. However, the fact, that similar reaction induced shapes were found in Ni catalysts supported on silica, magnesia and carbon [3-6,14], leads to the conclusion that, in general, the particle shape is determined by the type of the carbon deposited and the carbon precipitation process which, in turn, depends on the surface structure of the metal particle. The surface of the reduced Ni-Cu particles is enriched with Cu and is covered by highly dispersed alumina clusters [8] which inhibit methane decom- position and the precipitation of graphite as well. Indeed, both the global rates of carbon deposition and methane conversion decreased with Cu content (Table 1). In addition, the segregation of copper on the surface as islands on the Ni(l 11) planes could explain the formation of \"octopus\" carbon, when many filaments grow out from one metal facet (Fig. 5). Since the graphite planes are not curved in Ni-Cu catalysts, the total surface energy of the filament, that determines the minimum fiber diameter, is likely lower [9,12]. From this point of view, the filaments could grow out of every metal particle including small ones. However, Fig. 5 shows that the metal particles in Ni-Cu catalysts have also been sintered and, moreover, they are generally larger than in Ni samples (see also Ref. [6]). Therefore, a process of sintering predominates the carbon precipitation in Ni-Cu catalysts. Thus, after the initial period the system transforms to a generally new structure with respect to that before exposure to methane. From this moment the catalyst should be described as metal particles on the end (top) of the carbon filaments as a \"living\" support. Once being formed, these particles perform the L.B. AudeeL)a et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) I 17-129 127 reaction according to the generally accepted scheme [6,9]: methane decomposi- tion on the Ni(100) and/or Ni(ll0) planes; carbon diffusion through the particles; and graphite precipitation on the Ni(111) planes. The particles move chaotically like growing worms with the metal on their heads. The catalyst granules continuously swell due to the accumulation of carbon. Finally, the catalyst is deactivated and represents porous carbon in the form of hard irregular shaped granules up to 4 mm in size, with an average filament length of ca. 20 and 4 /zm in 90Ni and 57Ni samples, respectively. In principle, the deactivation of catalysts could be caused by any factor which breaks one of the above steps in the model. In the deactivated Ni samples EXAFS data showed the presence of Ni particles larger than 50 ,~. However, appropriate TEM pictures generally showed non-faceted particles mostly having no clearly resolved microdiffraction pattern. Therefore, we suggest that the mechanism of deactivation includes the fragmentation, e.g. splitting, of the metal particles into smaller inactive units. In some cases a tearing-off the cone-shaped apex into the filament body could occur. Indeed, Fig. 3b illustrates the elongated tail in two large metal particles which is absent in particle (A). In addition, the presence of small Ni crystallites in the interior of the carbon filament was found by Kuijpers et al. [15]. Since we know that the active metal particle has been formed by agglomeration of a large number of smaller ones, it must have long-range bulk or surface defects. Precipitation of carbon or, for instance, segregation of some impurities or by-products at these defects could split the particle or, at least, prevent the carbon diffusion. The situation is quite different with Ni-Cu samples. EXAFS data showed that approximately half of the nickel was atomically dispersed in or over the carbon filaments due to some kind of erosion process. At present, this mechanism is still unclear. We can only suppose that erosion of Ni enriches the copper surface content of Ni-Cu particles and, hence, accelerates the deactivation. The rate of \"atomic\" fragmentation appears to be lower than fragmentation by splitting, since the lifetimes of the Ni-Cu catalysts are significantly higher in comparison with Ni ones. The deactivated catalyst represents porous carbon and looks like a sponge. It is very amazing to see that the volume of the catalyst sample is increased after the reaction about three orders of magnitude. Therefore, the morphology of the catalyst, which continuously varied during the reaction, could not be ignored. The type of global reaction kinetics, presented on Fig. 1, is independent on the carbon deposition which favours the conclusion that no gas diffusion limitation occurs. However, from adsorption measurements we found that the total pore volumes in 57Ni and 90Ni samples are approximately identical and equal to ca. 0.3 cm3 g-~. Given a measured carbon density of 2.15 g cm-3, we have calculated the filling factor, Vcarbon/Vtota~, to be ca. 0.6. This value points to a close-packed structure of the carbon granule in both catalysts. In the deactivated Ni-Cu catalysts the filling factors were found to decrease to 0.56 and 0.4, in 128 L.B. AvdeeL,a et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 141 (1996) 117-129 87Ni-3Cu and 82Ni-8Cu samples, respectively, since it is more difficult to pack the \"octopus\" carbon. Therefore, from this point of view, the deactivation of Ni catalysts could be also explained so that the carbon \"worms\" stop moving in the porous frame when the filling factor achieves the appropriate maximum. In other words, the Ni particle on the top of the filament cannot penetrate through the interlacing fibers. As a result, the particle is likely encapsulated by carbon or fragmented to smaller units. 5. Conclusions Using coprecipitated Ni-alumina and Ni-Cu-alumina catalysts, up to 250 g/goat of filamentous carbon was produced by methane decomposition at 823 K and a methane pressure of 100 kPa. The process evolved three general stages. In the induction period carbon was dissolved into the Ni particles. This promoted the formation of large metal particles pear-shaped in Ni catalysts and quasi-oc- tahedral in Ni-Cu ones. The large particles are taken away by the carbon filament formed. Subsequently, new parts of the catalyst body are involved in the process. The catalyst granule swells continuously, producing a porous frame for lower-lying metal particles. Finally, the catalyst was deactivated producing hard porous granules. It appears that deactivation of the catalysts is caused by several reasons. Ni on the top of filament stops moving when the porous granules achieve the near close-packed structure and is subsequently fragmented or encapsulated by precipitated carbon. In addition, the fragmentation of the metal particles could also occur by splitting of the pear-shaped apex in the Ni catalysts as well as by atomic erosion in Ni-Cu ones.
