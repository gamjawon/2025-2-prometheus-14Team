However, the low conductivity and low active site density of these catalysts limit their effective application in electrochemistry. The results show that the electronic structure and spatial configuration of the active sites can be significantly improved by doping metal/non-metal elements, which can significantly improve the oxygen reduction activity and stability of the rare-earth based catalysts. In this paper, the main research work on improving the performance of rare earth-based catalysts doped with metal/ non-metal elements at home and abroad in recent years is reviewed, and their development prospects and future prospects are also prospected. 114417 Catalyst and catalytic mechanism for direct synthesis of cyclic carbonates by one-pot oxidative carboxylation of olefins and CO2 HuidongÂ Wang, ZiyuÂ Gao and JianminÂ Sun ZhonghuaÂ Sun, ZhihuiÂ Zhang, MingyangÂ He, QunÂ Chen and JunfengÂ Qian Contents 114400 PVP-assisted in-situ self-assembly hierarchical BiOCl with oxygen vacancies for efficient photocatalytic oxidation of cyclohexane under air in solvent-free conditions JunleiÂ Wang, KuanÂ Wang, TongÂ Sun, YiÂ Wang, Zhen-HongÂ He, HuanÂ Wang, WeitaoÂ Wang, YangÂ Yang and Zhao-TieÂ Liu 114397 Atomically dispersed Rh active sites on MOF-5 via defect engineering for hydroformylation of n-butene YifeiÂ Chen, XinnanÂ Zhao, ChenÂ Xin, XiuqinÂ Dong and HaoÂ Gong 114406 Enhancing the rigidity of the catalytic pocket entrance to improve catalytic efficiency and thermal stability of alginate Lyase from Pseudoalteromonas QiuyaÂ Gu, KeÂ Wang, ShuoqiÂ Jiang and XiaobinÂ Yu 114407 Exploring the key role of electronic effects in Pd catalysts supported on Ni-modified N-doped porous carbon for direct synthesis of H2O2 under atmospheric pressure DonghaiÂ Jiang, YongyongÂ Shi, LimingÂ Zhou, JunÂ Ma, ChaochuangÂ Yin, QianÂ Lin and HongyanÂ Pan Contents 114405 Photoinduced radical-polar-crossover cyanomethylation-cyclization cascade of unactivated N-alkene-linked indoles with bromoacetonitrile towards cyanomethylated pyrrolo[1,2-a]indoles QiÂ Wang, LiÂ Fu, ZhiyangÂ Gao, JiaqiÂ Huang, LeiÂ Zhang, HuaÂ Wang, YingfangÂ Zhong, ManÂ Zhou, QitongÂ Huang and MinÂ Yang Unactivated N-alkene-linked indoles were established as general substrates for cyanomethylation- cyclization cascade reactions with bromoacetonitrile in a photoinduced condition, generating diverse cyanomethylated pyrrolo[1,2-a]indoles with a broad substrate scope in moderate to good yields.
