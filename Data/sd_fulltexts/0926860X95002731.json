The alumina-boria catalysts have been prepared from boric acid using a classical impregnation method on porous and non-porous alumina. To obtain more dispersed boron oxide on the surface of the support, some alumina-boria samples were prepared by chemical vapour deposition and a comparisor~ with impregnated samples has been performed in the ethane selective oxidation. The contribution of gas-phase reactions to the formation of ethylene and the role of boron oxide at different percentages on alumina for ethane conversion are discussed. A maximum of activity (18.7% conversion) was observed with the sample with 30 wt.-% boron oxide on non-porous alumina. The main product was ethylene (16.7% yield) while CO and CH4 were the secondary products, coming from the decomposition of ethylene. A correlation has been demonstrated between catalytic activity and the acidity of the alumina-boria catalysts. The boron oxide (with its specific acidity) was responsible for the activation of ethane and for the stabilisation of the ethylhydroxyperoxide radical formed during the reaction and favouring the partial oxidation reaction leading to ethylene formation while alumina was shown to result into deep oxidation due to its too strong acidic sites. It is concluded that the role of alumina consists mainly in dispersing boria, resulting in a much more selective catalyst for ethane oxidation to ethylene than the support itself.

Colorio et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 137 (1996) 55-68 1. Introduction The selective oxidation of alkanes has been receiving increasing attention because of the potential benefits of using these inexpensive raw materials to produce chemicals. Among the alkanes, the catalytic oxidation of ethane has received the least attention, principally because of the existence of an attractive route to ethylene by non-oxidative cracking [ 1 ]. However, ethane is an abundant component in natural gas and is the primary product of methane conversion by oxidative coupling [2]. Thus, development of alternative conversion routes is desirable. The partial oxidation of ethane using oxygen as oxidant has already been reported [3-11 ]. However, most of the studies reported in the literature deal with N20 as oxidant [12-16], which is not a particularly attractive reactant for industrial purposes. However, recently Murakami et al. [17] have demonstrated that boron oxide supported on alumina could be a selective catalyst for partial oxidation of ethane into acetaldehyde using air as an oxidant. We have reported in previous papers [18,19] the acidity and the physico- chemical characteristics of alumina-boria studied by different techniques includ- ing adsorption microcalorimetry measurements of probe molecules and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) [20]. The alumina-boria catalysts are expected to exhibit no redox properties, in contrast with most metal oxide catalysts. Boron oxide deposited on alumina support was shown previously [18] to cover the acidic and basic sites of amphoteric alumina while generating acid sites of medium strength. In this paper, such alumina-boria catalysts were used for selective oxidation of ethane for ethylene production. The contribution of gas-phase reaction in the formation of ethylene and the role of boron oxide on alumina at different percentage are discussed in order to elucidate the reaction mechanism. To obtain more dispersed boron oxide on the surface of the alumina support, alumina-boria catalysts were prepared by chemical vapour deposition and a comparative study with samples prepared by impregnation was performed for the ethane selective oxidation reaction. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation The catalysts were prepared using two different methods: a classical impreg- nation method already described [20] and chemical vapour deposition (CVD).

Chemical vapour deposition apparatus: (1) Temperature-regulated bath for precursor, (2) precursor, (3) rotation system, (4) glass column, (5) pyrex glass reactor, (6) H.F. furnace, (7) coated alumina, (8) ground-glass filter, (9) connection with vacuum system and pressure control, (10) air flow control. [18], were used as support. Boron oxide used for impregnation was from Merck (purity > 99,8%). The chemical vapour deposition was performed as follows. A simple appara- tus (Fig. 1) specially convenient for laboratory experimentation on CVD from liquid precursor has been realized. It is composed by a fixed glass reaction vessel fitted at its top with an adjustable air inlet (10) and an outlet connected to a regulated vacuum line (9). The bottom of the reaction vessel is screwed on the driving part of a rotary evaporator (3) in which the evaporation flask, dipped into a temperature controlled bath (1), is filled with precursor (2). The upper part of the evaporator has been changed for a fritted glass support (4) carrying the alumina (7) and fitted to a graphite susceptor of a high frequency furnace (5) in order to heat the alumina substrate. The two mobile parts, precursor flask and 58 G. Colorio et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 137 (1996) 55-68 substrate support, can be rotated around a 45axis to homogenize the alumina. To avoid the blowing of the catalyst during the coating, the oxidation and hydrolysis of the boron oxide precursor was performed by an air stream through a microporous inlet (8). The precursor can be introduced with controlled flow and pressure through the heated alumina. The more efficient conditions for boron oxide deposition have been determined by changing the experimental parameters: the temperature of the substrate, the total pressure, the precursor oxidation air flow rate and the deposition time. In a standard preparation, the alumina support was pretreated in situ in an air flow at 450 for 2 h. The usual conditions for a 20% coating of B203 were the following: the precursor, B(OCH3)3, was kept at -5, the temperature of the substrate regulated at 300, a 60 cm3 min-1 air flow leading to a 4 kPa deposition pressure was regulated during the deposition. Calcination at 600 under air flow was further performed under the same conditions as for the impregnated samples. The catalysts so-prepared were introduced in the catalytic reactor and then heated up to the reaction temperature in a helium flow. 2.2. Catalytic test For the catalytic studies, ethane (99.4% purity) and ethylene (99.9% purity) were obtained from Air Liquide, helium (99.9% purity) from Carboxyque Fran~aise. All gases were used without further treatment. The catalytic experiments were performed in a fixed-bed continuous flow quartz micro-reactor, operating under atmospheric pressure. The temperature of the reactor was monitored by a thermocouple placed along the wall of the reactor. The temperature rate increase was 5/rain. The reaction conditions were as follows unless otherwise stated: W= 0.1 g, T= 550, F = 50 cm3 min-1, Pc~,6 = Po2 = 10 kPa and balance to atmospheric pressure was provided by helium. The reactants and the products were analyzed by means of a gas-chromato- graph equipped with a Porapak Q column using a flame ionisation detector and a thermal conductivity detector with a Carbosieve G column. The flows of ethane, oxygen and helium were controlled by Brooks mass flowmeters. A pressure gauge was included in the system to monitor its pressure and to ensure that a back pressure had not built up in the reactor. The activity will be reported below as the ratio of converted ethane to all products; the selectivity to a specific product is given as the percentage of ethane converted to that specific product. The contribution of 'wall effect' of the reactor on the catalytic activity was observed after many days of utilisation of the same reactor. After every catalytic test, the reactor was washed with distilled hot water but boron oxide had impregnated the reactor wall. G. Colorio et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 137 (1996) 55-68 59 3. Results 3.1. Gas-phase reaction 3.1.1. Homogeneous contribution to the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane Numerous examples of reactions involve a homogeneous contribution to the total effect of a catalyst via hetero-homogeneous pathways, particularly at high temperature. Ethane can undergo thermal dehydrogenation to ethylene in the gas-phase at high temperature. Alternatively, it may be activated by reactions with a molecular oxygen or HO., or HO2radicals [21]. Consequently, in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene it was important to take proper account of possible gas-phase contributions to the overall reactivity. The purpose of this part of our work was to examine the extent of homogeneous oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane under the experimental conditions typically used for the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation and thus to compare the yields of ethane produced in different cases. Firstly, in a new empty quartz reactor, the thermal pyrolysis of ethane could occur in the absence of oxygen above a minimum temperature of at least 535. The results showed that at 535 the non-oxidative pyrolysis of ethane was not significant. The reaction appeared at first sight to be very selective to ethylene (100%), with a conversion of 0.7% at temperatures above 550 with a total flow rate of 50 cm3 min- ~ and an ethane pressure of 10 kPa (Table 1). Secondly, oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane was performed with an empty new reactor using various ethane/oxygen ratios at different temperatures. The conversion and selectivities to ethylene and other products are shown in Table 1. A pressure lower than 10 kPa of ethane yielded only ethylene. The selectivity to ethylene for the oxidative dehydrogenation (Table 1) was very high, also at high temperature. Further oxidation or decomposition reactions of ethylene lead to the production of CO or CH4 respectively. The selectivity to carbon monoxide tended to increase with increasing temperature and at high temperature with increasing ethane/oxygen ratio val- ues. Only carbon monoxide was detected, a result which is consistent with the well established mechanism of gas-phase oxidation reactions. Methane was produced at high temperature (550) and with high concentration of ethane (14.4/10). The ethane conversion was not negligible at 550 and in presence of oxygen. Our results differ from those of Burch and Crab [22] and Roos et al. [23]. However, the experimental conditions used by these authors were considerably different from ours including a different dilution in helium. To summarize, the homogeneous reaction for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane could be important, the temperature at which it becomes significant depends on the partial pressures of ethane and oxygen. The presence of a certain 60 G.

Contribution of boron oxide coating on the reactor wall The experimental results without catalyst were not the same with a reactor which has worked many times with boron oxide catalyst and with a new reactor. In the aged empty reactor, the homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions still occurred and the conversion decreased appreciably, which is probably due to the presence of deposited boron oxide impregnating the walls of the reactor. Unfortunately, the amount of boron oxide coating was not measurable as a function of time and so the evaluation of the results was not easy. On Fig. 2, the ethane conversion and ethylene yield versus the temperature are illustrated for a new empty reactor and an aged empty reactor. G.

Ethane conversion (11), ethylene yield (+) versus the temperature () for new (1) and aged (2) (2 years) empty reactor (ethane pressure = 10 kPa, oxygen pressure = 10 kPa, Total flow rate = 50 cm3 min- ~). The results at 550 for various total gas flow rates with the new and aged reactors displayed the same trend as shown in Table 2. The deposited boron oxide seemed to act as an inhibitor especially at low total gas flow for the reaction of formation of ethylene and as catalyst for CO formation with ethylene, but no information on the nature of this coating was obtained. The insolubility in hot water of the coating and its inhibiting properties could be related to a reaction between the reactor walls and some gaseous boron oxide at high temperature. 3.2. The heterogeneous reaction 3.2.1. Catalyzed reactions on bulk boron oxide In Table 3, the main products of the catalytic reaction with bulk boron oxide compared to the reaction with the empty used reactor are represented.

The conversion was higher with boron oxide which had a very low surface area (0.4 m2 g-l) and should have melted under these experimental conditions. So, bulk boron oxide had a very high activity per m2 for ethylene formation. However, most of the studies reported in the literature [24] confirmed that boric acid and its derived products were utilized as inhibitors for the total oxidation of alkanes and more generally for the oxidation of organic products. In these experimental conditions at high temperature and in the presence of oxygen, the ethoxide, probably formed by the ethylhydroperoxide, was directly transformed in ethylene. Generally in the autooxidation of alkanes, the formation of esters of secondary alcohol by boric acid was a slow step in the reaction [24]. Boron oxide was able to esterify the alcohol produced and to protect it from successive oxidation. Another reason for a supposed selectivity for the alcohol formation was the capacity of boron oxide to decompose the formed hydroxyperoxide and to reduce the radicals formation. In all cases, the peroxide was the intermediate product [24]. The ratio between the different species was the same, but the conversion was twice as high with a coated utilised reactor. 3.2.2. Alumina sample These measurements were performed in order to compare the catalytic activity of the support with that of the alumina-boria samples. The predominant products C2H4, CO, CO2 and cn4 of the catalytic reaction are reported in Table 4. The yield of the partial oxidation product (C2H4) was lower than the yield of the total oxidation products (CO, CO2) and CH4 at 550. When the tempera- ture was decreased, the conversion decreased but the yield of CO remained very high. 3.2.3. Alumina-boria samples The catalytic activities of boron oxide supported on porous and non-porous alumina were measured and are summarized in Table 4. The ethane conversion and the yields for all the products were constant throughout 70 h of reaction. They are represented in Fig. 3 for the sample with 20 wt.-% of boron oxide supported on porous alumina. Though ethane was highly converted over pure alumina, the main product was CO. When 5 wt.-% of boron oxide was added to porous alumina, the G.

The behaviour of the sample seemed to be different related to support of boron oxide. When non-porous alumina was used, small changes in product selectivity were noted. CH4 was maintained at a very low yield and a slight decrease of C2H4 is related to a rise of the CO selectivity. The changes were more important when porous alumina was used.

Colorio et al./ Applied Catalysis A\" General 137 (1996) 55-68 CO yield decreased from 43% to 7%. A special case was obtained for a 5% coating, where the changes in the yields appeared to be very different. These differences could be interpreted in terms of coverage of the alumina support with B203. From a first order calculation, assuming a molecular cross-sectional area of B203 of about 17 nm2, the theoretical amount of a B203 monolayer over alumina may be evaluated to 21 wt.-% of B203 over the porous alumina and to 7 wt.-% of B203 over the non-porous alumina, respectively. In the 5% B203 on porous alumina, the amount of boron oxide was not high enough to cover the total surface of alumina. Many sites of free alumina remained uncovered and were responsible for total oxidation with this support. When reaching 20 wt.-% of boron oxide, the selectivity in ethylene increased hugely, while oxidation in CO decreased drastically. At high boron oxide percentage, the main product was always ethylene and the yields of CO and CH4 were very low. The addition of other layers of crystalline boron oxide on the surface of alumina appeared not to improve the results. With 30 wt.-% of boron oxide the conversion slightly decreased, but stayed very close to that for bulk boron oxide. In any case, a small amount of acetaldehyde and propene (1% and 0.2% respectively) was observed with longer residence time, while, for comparison, Murakami et al. [17] observed a selectivity of 3% for acetaldehyde. The addition of ethylene to the gas-phase mixture produced an increase of CO and CH4 products, which confirms the mechanism of the formation of these species from ethylene after oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. 3.2.4. The Chemical Vapour Deposition samples The CVD method was also utilized to prepare samples on porous alumina, the pores of which could be plugged by boron oxide. Table 5 presents the catalyst testing results for the impregnated and CVD catalyst samples with the same loadings of boron oxide and support.

G. Colorio et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 137 (1996) 55-68 65 When using the chemical vapour deposition method, the C2H4 selectivity was weakly improved. At a high percentage of boron oxide (30 wt.-%), the CVD sample showed improved conversion, whereas it was decreased at lower loading. With an amount of boron oxide lower than the monolayer (10 wt.-%), the results were identical for the two methods, so, the preparation method seemed to change neither the interaction mode between the oxide and the support nor the yield of the reaction in a significant way. With an amount of oxide higher than the monolayer, the chemical vapour deposition created a more homogeneously dispersed layer of boron oxide on the surface and a better catalytic effect. The preparation method did not affect the surface species because the products did not change. No oxygenated products besides carbon oxides were observed in both cases. 4. Discussion In previous papers [18,19], we have characterized the acido-basic properties of the alumina-boria catalysts using different techniques. The characteristic of alumina-boria, which is correlated to the catalytic activity, has been shown to be the acidity of the system. By adsorption microcalorimetry of ammonia, the acidity, at least for the weaker sites of the samples, has been shown to increase in number but not in strength with boron oxide content. The results of the measurements indicated that a large number of weak acid sites were created on the catalyst surface when the boria amount was larger than the amount necessary for the formation of the monolayer. The number of acid sites determined when using pyridine as probe molecule remained constant whatever the quantity of boron oxide. Pyridine, because of its steric hindrance, dosed only a certain kind of acid sites. In comparison, ammonia appeared to be adsorbed at three times the amount of pyridine on the 30 wt.-% catalyst. In any case, with a low percentage of boron oxide, new acid sites with medium strength were generated by covering of the strong acid sites of alumina. At high loadings of boron oxide, weak acid sites were generated by formation of oxide agglomerates. The acid sites were uniformly dispersed on the samples prepared by CVD. The basicity of the system, measured by sulphur dioxide adsorption, de- creased progressively with the increase of boron oxide, showing a good disper- sion of boron oxide at high percentage. The change of support did not affect the acid-base results expressed by m2 greatly, but the B203 amount required to correspond at least to the monolayer. Probably, as reported in the literature [17], the reaction mechanism under these experimental conditions was of radical type. 66 G.

[19]). The catalytic mechanism of the supported boron oxide action is probably the same as the mechanism proposed by Brotherton and Steinberg [24] for bulk boron oxide. The boron oxide with its specific acidity was responsible for the activation of ethane and for the stabilisation of the ethylhydroperoxide radical formed during the first step of the auto-oxidation reaction and favouring the partial oxidation with ethylene formation. In all cases, the peroxide was the intermediate product. The limitation of the oxidation was obtained through the boron oxide radical transfer. The active sites responsible for the catalytic activity were the weak acid sites generated by the deposited boron oxide at a percentage high enough to form a monolayer, on the alumina surface. When the amount of boron oxide was higher than the amount required for a monolayer, the formation of aggregates was observed involving a degree of acidity close to that of bulk boron oxide. In this case, the catalytic activity was comparable with the activity of bulk boron oxide. In Fig. 4, the selectivity of ethylene at 550 and the number of acid sites determined with different probe molecules versus the B203 loading on porous alumina is represented. A correlation was not obvious between the catalytic activity and the acid sites. This correlation was more evident at low percentage of oxide, since ammonia was able to titrate the acid sites both of alumina and boron oxide. At high percentage loadings, the multilayers of boron oxide could be used as G. Colorio et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 137 (1996) 55-68 67 a reserve of crystalline boron oxide which was lost by sublimation during the experimental procedure. A maximum of activity was observed with the sample with 25 wt.-% of boron oxide. CO and CH4 were the secondary products, coming from the decomposi- tion of ethylene. At high percentage of boron oxide, crystallites were present on the surface, as determined by the XRD characterization. For all percentages of oxide, only one species of boron was determined by XPS measurement. During the catalytic test, the amount of oxide that was deposited on the wall was not significant, as previously seen in the evaluation of the chemical analysis results. Homogeneous reaction in the empty reactor has to be considered, particularly under high pressure of oxygen, but not in our experimental condi- tions. The main changes were observed in the conversion ratio but not in the selectivity and the obtained results were very close to the highest selectivity values measured for highly dispersed boron oxide samples. 5. Conclusion From the above results one may conclude that: (1) The alumina-boria catalysts are suitable and relatively stable catalysts for the production of ethylene. Boron oxide covers the acid sites of A1203 which are detrimental to the selectivity to ethylene and creates new weakly acidic sites active for the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation into ethylene. (2) Boron oxide species, with its particular acidity and electron attractive characteristics, seemed to be the privileged element to form the stable ethylhy- droperoxides and to avoid total oxidation, leading to ethylene formation. (3) The role of the support was to disperse boron oxide on its surface and the porosity was shown not to play a significant role in the catalytic activity. References [1] C.N.

The alumina-boria catalysts have been prepared from boric acid using a classical impregnation method on porous and non-porous alumina. To obtain more dispersed boron oxide on the surface of the support, some alumina-boria samples were prepared by chemical vapour deposition and a comparison with impregnated samples has been performed in the ethane selective oxidation. The contribution of gas-phase reactions to the formation of ethylene and the role of boron oxide at different percentages on alumina for ethane conversion are discussed. A maximum of activity (18.7% conversion) was observed with the sample with 30 wt.-% boron oxide on non-porous alumina. The main product was ethylene (16.7% yield) while CO and CH4 were the secondary products, coming from the decomposition of ethylene. A correlation has been demonstrated between catalytic activity and the acidity of the alumina-boria catalysts. The boron oxide (with its specific acidity) was responsible for the activation of ethane and for the stabilisation of the ethylhydroxyperoxide radical formed during the reaction and favouring the partial oxidation reaction leading to ethylene formation while alumina was shown to result into deep oxidation due to its too strong acidic sites. It is concluded that the role of alumina consists mainly in dispersing boria, resulting in a much more selective catalyst for ethane oxidation to ethylene than the support itself.
