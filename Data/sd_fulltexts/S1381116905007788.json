Graphical abstract DRIFT spectra of carbonyl groups in supported titanium–magnesium (TiCl4/ID/MgCl2) catalysts suggest that internal donors (ethyl benzoate and di-n-butyl phtalate) form several different types of surface complexes. The possible nature of these complexes as related to the different Mg ions, to the mode of donor coordination and to the effects of TiCl4 are discussed. The state of internal donor (ID) in the supported titanium–magnesium (TiCl4/ID/MgCl2) catalysts for stereospecific propylene polymerization has been studied by diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFT). The samples were prepared via interaction of highly dispersed MgCl2 with different IDs (ethyl benzoate, EB; di-n-butyl phthalate, DBP) and TiCl4. It was found that the DRIFT spectra of carbonyl groups of IDs adsorbed on MgCl2 could be best described as a superposition of several overlapping vibration bands from a variety of surface complexes. Within this model the content of individual EB and DBP complexes on the MgCl2 surface was calculated. In the case of EB, three main complexes were found on the MgCl2 support in about equal proportions. In the case of DBP, only one of three complexes was preferentially formed. The surface content of both EB and DBP was found to decrease in presence of TiCl4. At the same time TiCl4 had influenced the distribution pattern of EB but not DBP complexes. The most likely scenario of competitive adsorption of TiCl4 and IDs on the MgCl2 support is discussed. A model describing surface distribution of TiCl4 on MgCl2 is proposed for TiCl4/EB/MgCl2 and TiCl4/DBP/MgCl2 catalysts. Keywords Ziegler–Natta polymerisation Propylene MgCl2 support DRIFT spectroscopy Internal donor 1 Introduction The internal donor (ID) is an important component in supported Ziegler–Natta catalysts for propylene polymerization responsible for stereospecificity of these catalysts [1–3]. It was demonstrated that the internal donor was strongly bound to the MgCl2 support and did not interact with adsorbed TiCl4 [4–7]. It is believed that the internal donor blocks particular sites on the MgCl2 surface, which otherwise upon coordination with TiCl4 would produce precursors of non-stereospecific active sites [4,8,9]. It was also suggested, that when adsorbed on the catalyst's surface the internal donor could convert aspecific active sites into specific ones [2,10–16]. Several theoretical studies have been performed to address the possible role of internal donors in Ziegler–Natta catalysts [17–19]. At the same time only limited experimental data on the distribution of the internal donor on the MgCl2 support has been reported so far. One 13C CP-MAS NMR study had found two esters (EB, ethyl benzoate and DIBP, di-iso-butyl phthalate) coordinated by non-equivalent surface sites on the MgCl2 surface, with diester demonstrating somewhat different behaviour than monoester [6]. DRIFT spectroscopy is one of the most useful research tools in studying variety of surface species in solid catalysts. It can also be applied to probe the state of carbonyl groups in the molecules of internal donors, since the ν(CO) adsorption band is very sensitive to coordination. Typical spectra of carbonyl groups of internal donors would have asymmetric shapes due to many different complexes co-existing on the surface [5,20–22]. In this work we have analyzed the ν(CO) regions in the DRIFT spectra of samples prepared via interaction of highly dispersed MgCl2 with EB (ethyl benzoate), DBP (di-n-butyl phthalate) and TiCl4. Broad and asymmetric ν(c) bands were deconvoluted into several components from individual surface complexes involving internal donors. Using this approach it was possible to obtain quantitative information on the content of different complexes of EB and DBP. The likely mechanism of competitive adsorption of internal donors and TiCl4 is discussed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Heptane, butylchloride, chlobenzene (PhCl), EB and DBP were used after dehydration over molecular sieves. All the preparation and manipulation with samples were performed under argon atmosphere. Argon gas was additionally dried with molecular sieves and using a Drierite gas drying unit with anhydrous calcium sulfate. 2.2 Support The highly dispersed MgCl2 support was prepared via interaction of magnesium metal powder with C4H9Cl (molar ratio C4H9Cl/Mg=3) in heptane at 98°C with subsequent washing with heptane [23]. The resulting MgCl2 support contained ca. 10wt.% of organic residue and had a surface area of ca. 90m2/g. 2.3 ID/MgCl2 samples The MgCl2·0.35EB, MgCl2·0.1EB, MgCl2·0.35DBP and MgCl2·0.1DBP samples were prepared by interaction of a suspension of MgCl2 in heptane (2.5ml/g of MgCl2) with corresponding ester (loading ester/MgCl2 molar ratio of 0.35:1 for the MgCl2·0.35ID samples and 0.1:1 for the MgCl2·0.1ID samples) at 103°C for 5h. The samples were washed twice with heptane. The EB/MgCl2 (−50°C) and DBP/MgCl2 (−50°C) samples were prepared by dosing ester (EB/Mg ratio of 0.0057 and DBP/Mg ratio of 0.00085 and 0.0017) to a suspension of MgCl2 in heptane (25ml/g of MgCl2) at −50°C for 0.5h. After dosing, the temperature was increased to 20°C and the reaction mixture was kept at this temperature for 1h. The EB/MgCl2 (20°C) and DBP/MgCl2 (20°C) samples were prepared by dosing ester (EB/Mg ratio of 0.014 and 0.028 and DBP/Mg ratio of 0.014) to a suspension of MgCl2 in heptane (25ml/g of MgCl2) at 20°C for 0.5h and kept at this temperature for 1h. The samples were washed once with heptane. The EB/MgCl2 (105°C) sample was prepared by adding EB to a suspension of MgCl2 (EB/MgCl2 =0.1) in PhCl (25ml/g of MgCl2) at 105°C and keeping the reaction mixture at this temperature for 1h. The resulted sample was washed once with PhCl at 105°C and twice with heptane. The DBP/MgCl2 (115°C) sample was prepared by adding DBP to a suspension of MgCl2 (DBP/MgCl2 =0.07) in PhCl (25ml/g of MgCl2) at 115°C and keeping the reaction mixture at this temperature for 1h. The resulted sample was washed once with PhCl at 115°C and twice with heptane. 2.4 Catalysts Titanium–magnesium catalyst (I) with a composition of TiCl4/EB/MgCl2 (0.77wt.% of Ti, 1.5wt.% of EB) was prepared via treatment of MgCl2 with a mixture of TiCl4/PhCl (1:1vol., Ti/Mg=10) in presence of EB (EB/MgCl2 =0.1) at 105°C for 1h and followed by two treatments with the same TiCl4/PhCl mixture at 105°C for 0.5h. The catalyst was washed once with PhCl and three times with heptane. Titanium–magnesium catalyst (II) with a composition of TiCl4/DBP/MgCl2 (0.82wt.% of Ti, 2.8wt.% of DBP) was prepared via treatment of MgCl2 with a mixture of TiCl4/PhCl (1:1vol., Ti/Mg=10) in presence of DBP (DBP/MgCl2 =0.07) at 115°C for 1h and followed by two treatments with the same TiCl4/PhCl mixture at 115°C for 1 and 0.5h. The catalyst was washed once with PhCl and three times with heptane. 2.5 Chemical analysis Titanium content in the samples was determined with inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). To determine DBP content the samples were suspended in heptane and decomposed by 10% H2SO4. The organic phase was separated, washed twice with distilled water, dried and weighted. The EB content was determined by GC analysis of the organic phase after hydrolysis of the samples in heptane with 10% H2SO4. 2.6 DRIFT measurements Prior to DRIFT measurements all samples were dried in vacuum at room temperature. The DRIFT spectra were recorded on a Bruker Vector 22 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a dry nitrogen chamber and sealed cells with CaF2 windows. All spectra were recorded with a nominal resolution of 4cm−1. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Interaction of EB with MgCl2 On the surface of highly dispersed polycrystalline MgCl2 there are three types of low-coordinated Mg ions, i.e. Q 5 sites, five-coordinated Mg ions at the (100) face; Q 4 , four-coordinated Mg ions at the (110) face, and Q 3 , three-coordinated Mg ions at the edges and corners of MgCl2 crystals [8,10]. These low-coordinated Mg ions demonstrate pronounced Lewis acidic properties and are capable of strong coordination of ester molecules, including EB and DBP internal donors studied in this work. Since there are several different Mg sites on the MgCl2 surface, it is typical to observe several types of carbonyl groups in the corresponding IR spectra of adsorbed IDs [24]. The individual c absorption bands would often overlap and produce a broad asymmetric feature covering the whole range of vibrations of carbonyl groups. As an example, the DRIFT spectra of the MgCl2·0.35EB and MgCl2·0.1EB samples (see Section 2) are shown in Fig. 1 . In this spectrum the absorption bands of carbonyl groups ν(c) can be seen in the range of 1600–1750cm−1 with at least four distinct maxima at ca. 1649, 1675, 1697 and 1724cm−1. The band at 1724cm−1 is close to the ν(c) carbonyl stretching vibrations in neat EB ester (ca. 1720cm−1) and can be attributed to carbonyl groups in loosely coordinated EB or EB in MgCl2·1EB and MgCl2·2EB complexes [22]. On the other hand it is known, that upon coordination of ester molecules to metal ions via carbonyl oxygen, the corresponding ν(c) frequencies would decrease relative to free ester [5]. Thus, we suggest that three remaining c bands in the DRIFT spectrum of this sample are most likely from three distinct types of EB species bound strongly to Q 3 –Q 5 Mg ions of MgCl2. The ratio between individual complexes can be determined via computer-assisted deconvolution of the DRIFT spectra into separate bands. In this work such deconvolution (Table 1 ) has been performed based on a Gaussian shape of the adsorption bands and on an assumption that each carbonyl band in the spectrum had the same extinction coefficient. It was found, the bands positions used for deconvolution do not depend on the composition of samples 1 and 2 in spite of significant differences in EB content and can be obviously used as start position for deconvolution of spectra of other samples studied in this work. We have also prepared a series of four EB/MgCl2 samples with progressively increased EB contents ranging from 1 to ca. 4wt.% (samples 3–6, Table 1). The preparation procedure has been chosen to increase EB/Mg ratio and temperature at adsorption of EB on MgCl2. In the samples 3 and 4 the quantity of adsorbed EB was equal to the quantity of EB used for adsorption. It is important that in samples 5 and 6 the amount of adsorbed EB was very close, or about 250μmol/g, as determined by the chemical analysis, despite almost three-fold difference in the EB loading in the reaction mixture and considerably higher reaction temperature for the latter (see Section 2, Table 1). We believe, that the loading of ca. 250μmol/g was the saturation level for EB adsorbed on used MgCl2 under our experimental conditions, above which no further EB adsorbtion was possible. This value is slightly higher than the content of Lewis acidic sites estimated via low temperature adsorption of CO on a similar MgCl2 sample (180μmol/g) [25]. The difference is likely due to incomplete coverage of centers with low acidity with CO. Note, much higher the EB content in samples 1 and 2 is due to other conditions of their preparation (higher (one order) concentration of reagents, other solvent) resulting in more profound interaction of EB and MgCl2 with a partial disintegration of MgCl2 structure. The DRIFT spectra for the samples 3–6 are compared in Fig. 2 . Similarly to the above-discussed DRIFT spectra of the MgCl2·nEB samples (Fig. 1), the c adsorption band in these samples is very broad and asymmetric indicating presence of several types of surface complexes in slightly different relative proportions. Based on the deconvolution model proposed for the MgCl2·nEB samples, these DRIFT spectra can also be presented as a superposition of three major components at ca. 1645, 1675 and 1695cm−1 (Figs. 2 and 3 ) (note absence of loosely coordinated EB in these samples). For the samples 4–6 an additional adsorption band of low intensity at ca. 1717cm−1 can be seen, and in the sample 6 prepared at high temperature a small shoulder at ca. 1737cm−1 was also found. Results of the computer-assisted deconvolution of these DRIFT spectra are summarized in Table 1. As has been mentioned above, three major types of EB species detected in the DRIFT spectra of EB/MgCl2 samples most likely correspond to three types of surface-exposed Mg ions in different chlorine coordination, Q 5 , Q 4 and Q 3 . It is understood, that the Lewis acidity of these ions would increase as Q 5 < Q 4 < Q 3 while the ν(c) frequency for surface EB·Q n complexes is likely to decrease in the same direction. Thus, individual c bands detected in the DRIFT spectra can be tentatively attributed to particular surface EB complexes: EB·Q 5 at 1695cm−1, EB·Q 4 at 1675cm−1 and EB·Q 3 at 1645cm−1. Relative amounts of EB·Q n complexes in the studied EB/MgCl2 samples as determined via deconvolution of the DRIFT spectra (Fig. 2) are summarized in Table 1. The sample 3 prepared at −50°C shows that at low temperatures EB would form predominately EB·Q 4 complexes with ν(c) at 1675cm−1. In the sample 4 all three surface complexes were populated in about equal proportions. In the samples 5 and 6, where the saturation EB loading was achieved (see above), the DRIFT spectra as well as their deconvolutions were remarkably close, indicating that similar complexes and in similar ratios were formed regardless of preparation conditions. 3.2 Interaction of EB with MgCl2 in presence of TiCl4 It is clear, that in real titanium–magnesium catalysts of propylene polymerization the active component, TiCl4, will affect the distribution of EB over MgCl2 surface. To investigate these effects, a catalyst sample with a composition of TiCl4/EB/MgCl2 was prepared under the same conditions (as to temperature, EB/Mg ratio, duration and solvents) as have been used to synthesize the EB/MgCl2 sample 6 (see Section 2). The chemical analysis data indicate, that when the treatment of MgCl2 with EB was performed in presence of TiCl4, the amount of adsorbed EB was considerably lower (Table 1). At the same time the total number of surface species (EB and TiCl4) found in the catalyst was very close to the EB content in the EB/MgCl2 sample, 260 and 240μmol/g, respectively. This observation suggests, that the lower EB content in the catalyst (I) is most likely a result of competition of TiCl4 and EB for the same surface adsorption sites. DRIFT spectra of two samples are compared in Fig. 3. The spectra are notably different due to different distribution patterns of EB complexes in two systems (Table 1). In the catalyst (I) EB exists mainly as EB·Q 4 complexes (71%) and only 24% as EB·Q 3 complexes, while the number of EB·Q 5 complexes in this catalyst was very low (not exceeding 3%). Two sets of data, DRIFT and the chemical analysis, have allowed us to identify most plausible localization of TiCl4 and EB species on different crystallographic faces of MgCl2 crystals (Table 2 ). Perhaps the most important observation was that the complexes of EB with Q 5 ions were almost totally eliminated in presence of TiCl4. There was also moderate (by ca. 40%) removal of EB·Q 4 and EB·Q 3 complexes. Thus, it becomes clear that TiCl4 may indeed substitute or prevent interaction of EB with all three types of Mg ions. TiCl4 predominately substitutes complexes of EB with Q 5 ions, while the most preferable interaction of EB in presence of TiCl4 is with Q 4 ions. In this sample TiCl4 species occupy almost all available Q 5 adsorption sites at the (100) face of MgCl2, when at the (110) face such species are likely to have EB species in their nearest surrounding (EB/Ti ratio for this face is 1.76). About 15% of TiCl4 molecules is coordinated by Q 3 Mg ions and would also contain EB in their nearest surrounding (EB/Ti ratio is 1.17). 3.3 Interaction of DBP with MgCl2 The DRIFT spectra of MgCl2·0.35DBP and MgCl2·0.1DBP samples prepared in excess of DBP were very complicated with several pronounced maxima (Fig. 4 ). These spectra can be best represented as a superposition of at least five separate bands at ca. 1650, 1672, 1699, 1722 and 1734cm−1 (Fig. 4(1)). The bands at 1650, 1672 and 1699cm−1 are most likely from complexes of DBP with surface acidic sites of MgCl2, since formation of such complexes would decrease the ν(c) vibration frequency comparing with neat ester (ca. 1728cm−1 in liquid DBP and 1760cm−1 in the gas phase). The bands at 1722 and 1734cm−1 may indicate presence of free or weakly bound carbonyl groups of ester molecules. The ratio between different carbonyl species depends on the composition of MgCl2·nDBP samples. Note here, similarly to EB containing samples the bands positions do not depend on the composition of samples. In the sample with lower ester content (MgCl2·0.1DBP) the share of complexes in the low frequency range (1650–1700cm−1) was higher (Fig. 4). This observation supports earlier suggestion, that the c absorption bands at lower frequency correspond to stronger complexes of esters with Mg ions. Indeed, such sites are first to be occupied at lower ester loadings. In DBP/MgCl2 samples prepared via controlled addition of ester to MgCl2 (Table 3 , samples 3–6) only surface DPB complexes were expected to form. The shape of DRIFT spectra for these samples depends on the DBP loading and synthesis conditions (Fig. 5 ) similarly to the EB/MgCl2 system. Using the same approach these DRIFT spectra were deconvoluted using band positions found for MgCl2·0.35DBP and MgCl2·0.1DBP samples. The deconvolution data are summarized in Table 3. It is interesting, that in all studied DBP/MgCl2 samples only a single predominant complex of DBP at ν(c)=1699cm−1 was apparently formed with 53–76% of the total intensity. The share of two other complexes with ν(c) at 1672 and 1650cm−1 had varied from 9 to 25%. Unlike the case of EB, for DBP it was difficult to attribute observed ν(c) bands to particular DBP complexes with Mg ions: DBP molecules have two carbonyl groups and may interact either with single Mg ion producing chelated complex or with two Mg ions producing bridged complex. Thus, the correlation between the number of chlorine vacancies at Mg ions and the ν(c) frequencies may be somewhat different from what was found for EB. Recent quantum chemical calculations has also suggested presence of both chelated and bridged complexes of phthalate on (110) face of MgCl2 surface [19]. The absolute energy of bridged phthalate complexes was lower at the (110) than at (100) face, while formation of chelated complexes at the (110) face was found less preferable then formation of bridged complexes at the (100) face. These most recent quantum chemical calculation data correlate well with earlier studies [17]. Based on these results, we may suggest two possible interpretations of DRIFT spectra recorded in the DBP/MgCl2 system. (i) The attribution similar to the EB/MgCl2 system, i.e. the complexes with ν(c) frequencies of 1699 and 1672cm−1 are the complexes of DBP with Q 5 and Q 4 ions, respectively. The complexes with Q 5 ions are most likely of bridged type, while complexes with Q 4 ions can be either chelated (two carbonyl groups per Mg ion) or bridged (two carbonyl groups per two Mg ions). Note, in this case similar frequencies of DBP and EB carbonyl groups with Mg ioms are observed (for instance, 1699 and 1695cm−1 with Q 5 Mg ions, respectively). (ii) The second possibility would be to assign the band at 1699cm−1 to chelated DBP complexes with Q 4 Mg ions while the band at 1672cm−1 to bridged DBP complexes with Q 5 ions. This possibility corresponds to literature data on the preferable coordination of an internal donor on the (110) face of MgCl2 (Q 4 ions) [8,26,27]. Thus, presented DRIFT data does not allow us to make conclusive attributions of the observed ν(c) bands to any particular type of surface DBP. At this moment we are performing quantum chemical simulations of the IR spectra for EB and DBP complexes with different types of Mg ions. We believe these results would help in selecting most plausible configurations of surface complexes of internal donors. 3.4 Interaction of DBP with MgCl2 in presence of TiCl4 The TiCl4/DBP/MgCl2 catalyst (sample 7) was prepared under the same conditions as the DBP/MgCl2 sample 6. The DRIFT spectra of these two samples are compared in Fig. 6 . According to the chemical analysis (Table 3), presence of TiCl4 resulted in a drastic decrease of the total DBP content in the catalyst sample, with both TiCl4 and DBP competing for the same MgCl2 sites, similarly to the catalyst (I) containing EB. The total content of the surface species (DBP and TiCl4) was similar in the catalyst (II) and in the DBP/MgCl2 sample 6, 280 and 250μmol/g, respectively. In the catalyst (II) significant part of DBP was converted into phthaloyl chlorides as supported by the presence of the characteristic DRIFT band at ca. 1752cm−1 from COCl groups (Fig. 6) [21]. The latter feature was the main difference between the DBP/MgCl2 sample 6 and the catalyst (II), while the distribution patterns of carbonyl groups among different sites were similar for two samples (Table 3). The complexes of DBP characterized by ν(c) of 1699cm−1 had dominated in both cases. It was possible to quantify distribution of DBP complexes on MgCl2 in presence and absence of TiCl4 (Table 4 ). Different types of DBP complexes were replaced with TiCl4 in close proportions contrary to the catalyst (I) containing EB, where favorable removal of only one type of complexes was observed (Table 2). In the total the TiCl4 complexes are distributed on different Mg ions in the proportion 3:1:6 (Table 4) at the places of DBP complexes possessing with ν(c) of 1650, 1672 and 1699cm−1, correspondingly. TiCl4 complexes adsorbed on different Mg ions could contain DBP in their nearest surrounding (the DBP/Ti ratio at all ions is 0.5–0.78). 4 Conclusion It has been established that the internal donors (EB and DBP) could form different surface complexes on the MgCl2 support, in particular, with three-, four- or five-coordinated Mg ions (Q 3 , Q 4 or Q 5 ). In the case of EB these complexes were formed in close proportions. In the case of DBP formation of only one type of complexes was most preferable. In presence of TiCl4 the surface complexes of EB were formed mostly with Mg(Q 4 ) ions. At the same time TiCl4 had not affected the distribution pattern of DBP complexes on the MgCl2 support. In both cases presence of TiCl4 resulted in considerable decrease in the total content of internal donor. Apparent competition of the internal donor and TiCl4 for the same surface adsorption sites has allowed us to probe the distribution of TiCl4 on different Mg ions. This information readily accessible via DRIFT spectroscopy may be useful in understanding different catalytic behavior of catalysts prepared with EB and DBP internal donors, and further in developing more effective TiCl4/ID/MgCl2 catalytic systems.

The samples were prepared via interaction of highly dispersed MgCl2 with different IDs (ethyl benzoate, EB; di-n-butyl phthalate, DBP) and TiCl4. It was found that the DRIFT spectra of carbonyl groups of IDs adsorbed on MgCl2 could be best described as a superposition of several overlapping vibration bands from a variety of surface complexes. Within this model the content of individual EB and DBP complexes on the MgCl2 surface was calculated. In the case of EB, three main complexes were found on the MgCl2 support in about equal proportions. In the case of DBP, only one of three complexes was preferentially formed. The surface content of both EB and DBP was found to decrease in presence of TiCl4. At the same time TiCl4 had influenced the distribution pattern of EB but not DBP complexes. The most likely scenario of competitive adsorption of TiCl4 and IDs on the MgCl2 support is discussed. A model describing surface distribution of TiCl4 on MgCl2 is proposed for TiCl4/EB/MgCl2 and TiCl4/DBP/MgCl2 catalysts.",
