Polyaniline/gamma aluminum oxide (PAn/γ-Al2O3) nanocomposites were synthesized via in situ electropolymerization on gold electrodes and modified electrodes (Au/PAn/γ-Al2O3) were used for the detection of vitamin E (VE). The electrochemical and electropolymerization performance of aniline in the presence of γ-Al2O3 nanoparticles improved dramatically. The kinetic results indicate that the polymerization growth rate of PAn in the presence of nanoparticles catalyst on Au electrode is fast. The resulting electrode exhibited excellent performance with regard to detecting VE. The mechanisms of electropolymerization of aniline in presence of γ-Al2O3 nanoparticle catalyst and mechanism of redox behavior of VE are investigated. The limit of detection (LOD) was observed to be around 0.06 μM. The tolerance limits of some important interfering species with VE were studied. Graphical abstract Unlabelled Image Keywords γ-Al2O3 Catalyst Polyaniline Kinetic Biosensor Vitamin E 1 Introduction Nanocomposite-based polymeric matrices are a new paradigm in materials science due to the intelligent incorporation of nanoparticles, which has served to enhance performance and lead to specialized applications. The properties of nanocomposites are extremely dependent on the distribution of nanoparticles within a polymeric matrix [1]. Conductive polymers (CPs) have been used as conventional polymeric matrices. Among the potential CPs, polyaniline (PAn) and its nanocomposites have been actively studied due to their high conductivity, high storage capability, distinct oxidation states, and mechanical flexibility [2]. Thus, PAn is considered to be an attractive material for biosensors [3]. On the other hand, metal oxide nanoparticles are considered to be a good filler material. Metal oxide nanoparticles have been used in a variety of applications, such as sensors, fuel cells, batteries, and catalysts [4,5]. In particular, gamma-alumina (γ-Al2O3) is an important catalyst with a large surface area, pore volume, pore-size distribution, and acid/base characteristics [4–7]. PAn also possesses a distinct redox behavior, which is dependent on filler properties. The γ-Al2O3 nanoparticles are able to catalyze some of the PAn redox behavior within the polymer matrix. The in situ electropolymerization of An and the electrosynthesis of nanocomposites has been reported previously [8]. Anodic oxidation is the most important electropolymerization method used to prepare CPs. However, the electropolymerization mechanism of CPs has continued to be a controversial subject that is not yet wholly understood. Vitamin E (VE) is a mixture of four tocopherols (α, β, γ, and δ) and tocotrienols. Among them, alpha-tocopherol (α-TOH) has been studied most widely due to its antioxidant properties that serve to protect living cells by quenching free radicals [9]. Here, we synthesized PAn in presence of γ-Al2O3 nanoparticles, as a catalyst, on gold electrodes via in situ electropolymerization methods. The electrochemical techniques, as simple, stable, fast, cheap, sensitive methods, were used to evaluate of application and electrochemical performance of PAn/γ-Al2O3 nanocomposites. By intelligently selecting and adding nanoparticle (γ-Al2O3) and synthesis of PAn/γ-Al2O3 nanocomposite, we achieved three goals, catalyze of electropolymerization of PAn, susceptible to supercapacitor material, and biosensor for vitamin E detection. This modified electrode was thus investigated and applied to the detection of VE. 2 Experimental An (99%, Aldrich) was distilled, yielding a colorless product that was used. γ-Al2O3 nanopowder (99%, 20 nm, US Research nanomaterials, Inc., TX, USA), sulfuric acid (98%, Merck), HClO4 (98%, Merck), acetonitrile (99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich), KCl (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), and lithium perchlorate (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as-is without further purification. In order to clean the gold electrodes of any surface impurities prior to electropolymerization of the An/γ-Al2O3 nanocomposite, CVs were obtained in 0.1 M HClO4 at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 for 50 cycles [10]. The gold electrode was roughened (polycrystalline 99.99%, polished down to 0.3 μm Al2O3) to increase its surface activity, which was performed in a separate cell with an aqueous solution of 0.1 M KCl through treatment with 50 oxidation–reduction cycles (ORC) between E SCE = −0.28 and 1.22 V at 500 mV s−1 [12]. VE (α-TOH) was obtained as a gift from Caspian Tamin Pharmaceutical Co (Iran). A traditional three-electrode glass cell was used with a potentiostat/galvanostat (Autolab PGSTAT302 N). EIS and charge-discharge measurements were performed with a Zahner/Zennium potentiostat/galvanostat (Zahner, Germany). Synthesis of the nanocomposites was performed under magnetic stirring of around 120 cycles per minute, due to the formation of homogenous and thick nanocomposite films. Moreover, stirring served to keep the nanoparticles in suspension and caused the nanoparticles to be in continuous contact with the electrode surface. A double band-gap gold electrode was used as a working electrode for the in situ conductivity measurements. Details with regard to the methods and instruments for the in situ conductivity measurements were described previously [11]. Impedance measurements were performed at an open circuit potential between the frequency range of 10 kHz–50 mHz with a sinusoidal potential signal amplitude of 10 mV. Experimental impedance spectroscopy data was fit to the proposed equivalent circuit using Z-view software. The experiments were performed at room temperature with nitrogen-purged solutions. 3 Results and discussions Fig. 1A shows the initial CV curves for the PAn and PAn/γ-Al2O3 nanocomposites. During the positive scan, the current increased steeply at 0.81 and 0.74 V and anodic oxidation peak potentials were observed at 1.05 and 0.93 V for the An and An/γ-Al2O3 nanoparticles, respectively. The anodic oxidation peak current of the An/γ-Al2O3 nanoparticles was much higher than that of An. The difference between the anodic peak potential and half the anodic peak potential (E pa-E pa/2) was estimated to be 0.11 and 0.09 V for An and An/γ-Al2O3, respectively. During the negative scan, two trace crossings were observed due to the nucleation overpotential. The first/second trace crossing for the An and An/γ-Al2O3 nanoparticles occurred at about 0.65/0.86 and 0.61/0.77 V, respectively. Oligomer electrooxidation was easier than that of the aniline monomer due to its extensive π conjugation. Alternatively, it was suggested that the trace crossing was due to an increased local concentration of oligomers close to the electrode [10]. The catalytic effect of γ-Al2O3 nanoparticles on the electropolymerization of An could be clearly seen in previously reported CV data, showing that CV could enhance catalysis of the monomer redox process [4,12]. Chain propagation between an oligomer-monomer and monomer-monomer was rather difficult due to the slow elimination of protons from the intermediate (Scheme 1 ). The intermediates of An dimers and other oligomers were weak acids. On the other hand, γ-Al2O3 nanoparticles possess vast surfaces covered by OH groups that can serve as proton acceptors and facilitate proton elimination [6,7]. An increase in current with each cycle indicated polymer growth on the electrode surface (Fig. 1B). During the electropolymerization process, three redox peaks were observed for the PAn/γ-Al2O3 nanocomposite. Compared to the polyaniline voltammograms [9], the redox peak potentials were shifted slightly to positive values. The morphology of PAn/γ-Al2O3 was compared with that of PAn via SEM (Fig. S1A) and TEM (Fig. S1B). The nanocomposite TEM image clearly supported the incorporation of γ-Al2O3 nanoparticles into PAn when compared to the TEM image of PAn [9]. The presence of nanoparticles in the polymer film was also confirmed via EDX analysis (Fig. S1C). Fig. 1C shows CV data for the PAn and PAn/γ-Al2O3 nanocomposites on the electrode. The charging current of Au/PAn/γ-Al2O3 was higher than that of Au/PAn due to an increase in surface area. The PAn/γ-Al2O3 nanocomposite possessed four redox peaks corresponding to polaron states, benzoquinone/hydroquinone, p-aminophenol/benzoquinoneimine, and bipolaron states, respectively. Benzoquinone/hydroquinone and p-aminophenol/benzoquinoneimine were products of PAn degradation during growth. The oxidation peak potential of benzoquinone/hydroquinone in the presence of γ-Al2O3 nanoparticles was shifted toward a negative potential and was separated from the p-aminophenol/benzoquinoneimine peak. Peak separations (ΔE = Epc − Epa) for the benzoquinone/hydroquinone and p-aminophenol/benzoquinoneimine peaks were 0.0 and 7.0 mV, respectively; however, these peaks overlapped and were not distinguishable from each other in the absence of γ-Al2O3 nanoparticles. In the presence of γ-Al2O3 nanoparticles, the peak current increased for all redox peaks. Moreover, peak currents for the benzoquinone/hydroquinone and p-aminophenol/benzoquinoneimine peaks increased linearly between the scan rate of 10 and 200 mV s−1, which supported the redox surface-controlled process. The electrochemical performance of the modified electrode as a biosensor was measured in a non-aqueous solution containing VE. Fig. 1D compares the CV data for 3.0 mM VE recorded with bare Au, Au/Pan, and Au/PAn/γ-Al2O3 electrodes (after electrosynthesis of the PAn and PAn/γAl2O3 nanocomposites via 7 cycles on clean [10] and treatment with 25 activated Au [13] oxidation-reduction cycles (ORC). The CV data of VE revealed two different redox peaks at 0.75 V (ox.) and −0.45 (red.) (Fig. 1D). The first peak indicated that VE (α-TOH) was oxidized to quinone [14], which was more complicated than expected for a simple reversible electron transfer. Quinone could be reduced during the negative scan. The modification of Au/PAn with γ-Al2O3 yielded a well-defined VE oxidation peak with an improved peak separation potential (ΔE) of 25 mV (see Table S1). Furthermore, a substantial negative anodic peak potential (E a ) shift by about 35 mV and a 1.7-fold increase in anodic current was observed for the Au/PAn/γ-Al2O3 electrode over that of Au. Additionally, E pa -E pa/2 of about 32 mV was obtained for the voltammogram of VE at the Au/PAn/γ-Al2O3 electrode, which was lower than that at the Au and Au/PAn electrodes. The ECE process predicted an E pa -E pa/2 separation of 56.5/n mV [14]. Therefore, small values of E pa -E pa/2 proved an ECE mechanism. With regard to four heterogeneous one-electron-transfer steps and three homogeneous proton-transfer reactions involving phenolic hydrogen ions for the voltammetry oxidized VE (α-TOH) in CH3CN (ECE mechanism, intermediate pathway, Scheme S1) [14], proton exchange was an important step and γ-Al2O3 was prone to accepting protons and facilitating the electrooxidation of VE. The cathodic charge at the gold electrode as a function of potential cycle number (CN) can be seen in Fig. S2A and B. These data were used to calculate the degree of polymer growth [15]. The rate equations, kinetic expressions, and polymerization reactions of aniline are described in the Eqs. (S1)–(S3). Reaction orders were calculated during the 25 cycles and the obtained kinetic parameters can be found in Table S2. Data in Table S2 indicates that the growth rate is around l/3 order with respect to the AnH concentration. Which suggested that polymer grew in one dimension or close to the gold electrodes [15] and about 1/2 order with respect to the polymer itself. The 1/3–l/2 orders suggest that the formation of a dimer or trimer radical cation might present the rate limiting step for the polymerization reaction. Also, the dependence of the growth rate with β′ is consistent with an autocatalytic growth mechanism [16]. Compared to PAn, the growth rate order for the PAn/γ-Al2O3 films was slightly higher due to a higher anodic current and lower oxidation potential. The electrochemical behavior of the modified electrodes was investigated via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and conductivity measurements. The EIS diagrams of the PAn and PAn/γ-Al2O3 electrodes were obtained at open circuit potentials (OCP) between the range of 10 kHz–50 mHz in 1.0 M H2SO4 (Fig. 2A). The PAn/γ-Al2O3 electrode diagram consisted of an inductor (L), a small distorted semicircle (at high frequencies), and a nearly straight line (at low frequencies). The existence of an inductive component within the high frequency region was associated with the porous nature of the electrode [17]. The EIS diagram of PAn (without inductive impedance) with Warburg impedance (W) corresponded to the diffusion of H+ and SO4 −2 ions [18]. No separate semicircle in the diagrams represented a very small charge transfer resistance at the PAn/γ-Al2O3 electrode/electrolyte interface. The linear component of the PAn/γ-Al2O3 Nyquist diagrams was closer to a vertical line along the imaginary axis than that of PAn, suggesting that the PAn/γ-Al2O3 electrode was more activated than the PAn electrode, which was consistent with the CV results. The in situ conductivity results (not shown here) indicated that the conductivity of PAn/γ-Al2O3 was higher than that of PAn, which was consistent with prior results [8]. The differential pulse voltammogram (DPV) with different VE concentrations was recorded at the Au/PAn/γ-Al2O3 electrode under optimum conditions (Fig. 2B). The anodic peak current (I pa /μA) exhibited a good linear relationship with the concentration of VE. Using DPV, the pulse amplitude, pulse width, and scan rate were tested over the following variable ranges of interest: 25–100 mV (pulse amplitude), 30–100 ms (pulse width), and 10–100 mV s−1 (scan rate). During the test, two parameters were held constant while the other was changed. Finally, well-shaped curves were observed with relatively narrow peak widths and good sensitivity at the optimal values of 60 mV for the pulse amplitude, 35 ms for the pulse width, and 80 mV s−1 for the scan rate. The limits of detection (LOD) were calculated to be 0.06 μM based on 3SD (SD is the standard deviation) of the calibration curve (n = 5). The tolerance limits of some important interfering VE species were evaluated (Table S3). We selected dopamine, ascorbic acid, uric acid, VB6, VA, thiourea, urea, glucose, Cu2+, and Fe2+ as interfering species, which were present in collected urine, food, and other biological fluid samples. Under optimal conditions, a relative maximum error of 3–5% was observed and was considered tolerable. The results indicated that the proposed modified electrode functioned as a good sensor for VE. 4 Conclusions In conclusion, we synthesized PAn in the presence of γ-Al2O3 nanoparticles as a catalyst via in situ electropolymerization on gold electrodes. By intelligently selecting and adding γ-Al2O3 nanoparticles, the electropolymerization of aniline was improved and the electrochemical activity of PAn on gold electrodes was enhanced. This was achieved through a simple procedure that did not utilize any complex materials. The fabricated modified electrode could be utilized as a good sensor for VE without interfering with other competing species.

The electrochemical and electropolymerization performance of aniline in the presence of γ-Al2O3 nanoparticles improved dramatically. The kinetic results indicate that the polymerization growth rate of PAn in the presence of nanoparticles catalyst on Au electrode is fast. The resulting electrode exhibited excellent performance with regard to detecting VE. The mechanisms of electropolymerization of aniline in presence of γ-Al2O3 nanoparticle catalyst and mechanism of redox behavior of VE are investigated. The limit of detection (LOD) was observed to be around 0.06 μM. The tolerance limits of some important interfering species with VE were studied.",
