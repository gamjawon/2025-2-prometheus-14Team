Ganeshpure and Sheo Satish Research Centre, Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Limited, Vadoaara 391 346 (India) (Received October 1, 1991; accepted February 10, 1992) Abstract Mono- and binuclear complexes of Ru(III) were synthesized using Schiff base ligands obtained by condensation of 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde with 1,2- and 1,3- or 1,4-phenylenediamine, respectively. The complexes were characterized by analytical, spectral, conductance, cyclic voltammetry, and ESR studies. The epoxidation of alkenes was studied using these complexes as catalysts and iodosylbenzene as an oxidant. The complexes were found to be remarkably stable under the reaction conditions. Rates of the epoxidation of cis-cyclooctene using binuclear complexes were found to be nearly twice those using the mononuclear ones, indicating participation of both the metal centres of the former in the reaction. The absence of p.-oxo reaction product was shown by cyclic voltammetric studies. The mechanism of the reaction is suggested. Introduction Interest in hydrocarbon oxidation has stimulated a major effort to mimic the oxygen activation and transfer reactions characteristic of cytochrome P450 [1-,4]. The development of synthetic chemical models that mimic the active site of heme proteins has provided a detailed understanding of the oxygen binding by globin and oxidations mediated by cytochrome P-450 [5]. Many of the essential features of oxygen transfer by cytochrome P-450 have been modelled with synthetic metalloporphyrin catalysts using iodosylbenzene or other single oxygen donors as oxidants [6]. A useful chemical simplification of the process of oxygen transfer by metal is the oxygen rebound mechanism [ 7 ] (Scheme 1). Recently, mono- and,binuclear transition-metal complexes derived from ligands other than porphyrins have also been employed as catalysts for epoxidation of alkenes [8 ]. The use of metal-Schiff base complexes, e.g., metal-salen and metal-saloph, to catalyse the oxidation of hydrocarbons by *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/92/$5.00 0 1992 - Elsevier Sequoia.

In recent years, Ru-aminocarboxylic acids, Ru-salen, and Ru-saloph have been reported as oxidation catalysts [13-16]. In cytochrome P-450, the Fe(III) centre is coordinated to the four nitrogen atoms of porphyrin. Hence salen, saloph, or aminocarboxylic acid complexes with O and N donor atoms are not close models for such metalloporphyrins. Earlier, we showed that Schiff bases derived from 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde and diamines are stable under the oxidation reaction conditions. It has also been shown that the bridged binuclear Schiff base complexes of Fe(III) and Mn(II) are more selective catalysts for epoxidation of alkenes than the corresponding mononuclear complexes [ 17, 18 ]. We now report synthesis of mono- and binuclear Ru(III) complexes with a ligand derived from the condensation of 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde with 1,2-, 1,3-, and 1,4-phenylenediamine, and the study of their use as catalysts for epoxidation of alkenes using iodosylbenzene as an oxidant. Experimental Ruthenium trichloride hydrate (Johnson Mathey) and 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde (Fluka) were used as received. 1,2-, 1,3-, and 1,4-phenylenediamine (Fluka) were recrystallized before use. Iodosylbenzene was prepared according to the method of Lucas et al. [ 19 ]. All other chemicals were of AR grade and were used as received. The solvents were purified by reported literature procedures. Freshly double-distilled water was used. Synthesis of complexes 1-3 To a solution of 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde (2 mmol) in dry ethanol (25 ml) was added a solution of 1,2-, 1,3-, or 1,4-phenylenediamine (1 mmol) in dry ethanol (60 ml), and the mixture was stirred for 30 min. The Schiff base formed was then added dropwise to a solution of RuC13 - 31120 (1 mmol) in dry ethanol (50 ml). The mixture was stirred for 30 min and then refluxed on a water bath under dinitrogen atmosphere for 6 h. Excess solvent was evaporated: the solid was filtered, washed with dry ethanol, and dried under vacuum at 100 C. Physical measurements Microanalysis of the complexes was done using a C, H, N Carlo Erba 1106 elemental analyser.

Solution electric conductivities were measured at room temperature on a Toshniwal conductivity bridge. Electronic spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-Vis spectrophotometer UV-160. The ESR investigation was carried out with a Bruker ESP-300 X-band spectrometer using a 100 kHz field modulation. The magnetic field was calibrated using an ER-035 NMR gaussmeter. DPPH was used as a field marker (g = 2.0046). ESR. experiments were conducted on powder samples at 298 and 77 K. Low-temperature measurements were performed using a quartz Dewar. Cyclic voltammetry data were recorded on a Princeton Applied Research electrochemistry system (model 174) equipped with a precision x-y recorder. The working electrode was platinum. The reference electrode was Ag/AgCl (0.1 m) in 1:1 v/v water-dioxane. Procedure for catalytic oxion of alkenes The oxidation reactions using complexes 1-3 as catalysts were carried out in a Schlenck tube under dinitrogen atmosphere. To a solution of catalyst (0.01 mmol) in water (1 ml) was added a solution of alkene (2.5 mmol) in dioxane (6 ml), and the mixture was de-aerated by bubbling dinitrogen for 10 min. Iodosylbenzene (0.5 mmol) was added, and the mixture was stirred at 25 C for 45 min. A suitable internal standard was added, and the reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography. 280 Results and discussion The elemental analyses (Table 1) of complexes 1-3 were found to be in good agreement with the proposed formulae. IR spectral data of the complexes in the solid state showed bands at 1610-1590 cm-1, corresponding to the coordinated azomethine (C=N-) stretching, and the bands due to v(M-Py) at 280-255 cm-'. The far-IR spectra of the complexes exhibit a highly intense band at 320 cm-1 due to the Ru-Cl stretching mode, indicative of a trans configuration of the chlorides [20]. All the complexes were soluble in DMF, water, and water-dioxane (1:1). To determine the number of chlorides inside and outside the coordination sphere of the complexes, the molar conductances were measured in DMF as well as in water. The molar conductance of complex 1 was found to be 88 fl-' M-' cm' in dry DMF and 280 S2' M-' cm' in water. This shows that in the solid state or in DMF, two chlorides are coordinated with the metal at axial positions, and one remains outside the coordination sphere. The value of the molar conductance in water corresponds to a 1:3 electrolyte, indicating that chlorides get dissociated in water. For the binuclear complexes, 2 and 3, the molar conductances in dry DMF were found to be 167 and 185 fl-' M-' cm', respectively, corresponding to two ionisable chloride ions outside the coordination sphere. The molar conductances of complexes 2 and 3 in water were found to be 564 and 580 fl-' M-' cm', respectively. These correspond to a 1:6 electrolyte, and indicate that all six chlorides become dissociated in water. To know the number of free coordination sites available on the metal centre of the complexes under the conditions of catalytic reactions, the molar conductances of the complexes were also measured in water-dioxane (1:6). The values were found to be the same as in water, indicating that in water-dioxane mixture all the chlorides remain in the dissociated form.

The calculated g, values are given in Table 1. There is no hyperfine splitting due to coupling with the ruthenium nuclear spin 1= 5/2. Similar values were observed by Taqui Khan and coworkers [21 ] in the case of mononuclear Ru(III)--Schiff base complexes. A shift in g values occurs upon cooling the sample to 77 K. Thus the ESR spectra in the present binuclear complexes are similar in nature to those of the mononuclear complexes. This indicates that the two paramagnetic centres are equivalent and there is no superexchange interaction between the two metal centres. Catalytic oxidations Iodosylbenzene was used as a terminal oxidant, as the course of the reaction can readily be monitored by observing the gradual disappearance of iodosylbenzene and by analysis of its innocuous reduction product, iodobenzene. Optimum conditions for the catalytic epoxidation were initially developed with norbornene. It was found that alkenes used did not undergo epoxidation in the absence of either a catalyst or an oxidant. However, norbornene gave a negligible quantity of epoxide in the presence of iodosylbenzene alone. The results of epoxidation of alkenes with iodosylbenzene using the mono- and binuclear complexes 1-3 as catalysts are shown in Table 2. The analysis of the oxidation products showed that norbornene, ciscyclooctene, and traps-4-octene gave the respective oxides, selectively. Oxidation of styrene gave a mixture of styrene oxide and phenylacetaldehyde. It has been reported that a part of styrene oxide rearranges to phenylacetaldehyde owing to the influence of heat in the GC injection port [22]. However, the possibility of the formation of phenylacetaldehyde as the oxidation product is not ruled out. It is observed that electron-rich alkenes such as norbornene, cis-cyclooctene, and styrene are substantially more reactive than the acyclic alkene trans-4-octene. In the case of cyclohexene, epoxidation is accompanied by a large amount of allylic hydroxylation and subsequent ketone formation. A Ru(V)-oxo species is usually proposed as the intermediate in Ru(III) complex-catalysed oxidations using iodosylbenzene. Taqui Khan and co workers [23] have isolated and characterized such species from Rum (saloph) and iodosylbenzene. On the other hand, Valentine and others [8, 24, 25] have proposed that metal-catalyzed oxidation may proceed via a M-O-I-Ph reactive intermediate. Such a metal-iodosylbenzene adduct has been isolated by Smegal and Hill [26], in the manganese porphyrin system. Our attempts to isolate or characterise the active catalytic species in solution were un successful, perhaps owing to its poor stability. When iodosylbenzene (3 equiv.) was added to solutions of metal complexes 1-3 in water-dioxane (1:1), the colour of the solution changed from reddish-brown to green, indicating the formation of a new species. However, the UV Vis spectrum 282 TABLE 2 Alkene epoxidation catalyzed by complexes 1-3a Alkene Catalyst Epoxide yield\" Norbornene 1 8 2 8 3 9 cis-cyclooctene 1 19 2 24 3 32 Styrene 1 17 (3 ) 2 23 (5`) 3 27 (5`) trans-4-octene 1 4 2 6 3 7 Cyclohexene 1 40 (3 , 11 ) 2 20 (Id, 4e) 3 26 (2d, 6e) aSubstrate:oxidant:catalyst mole ratio 250:50:1; solvent, water-dioxane (1:6, v/v); react. time, 45 min.

Therefore, in the present work, we cannot unambiguously identify the structure of the reactive intermediate complex that is responsible for the observed epoxidation reaction. The complex catalysts 1-3 were isolated at the end of the epoxidation reaction, washed with acetone, and dried under vacuum. The IR spectra of the used complexes were identical with those of the original complexes. This indicates that the complexes did not undergo oxidative disintegration during the reaction. This conclusion is further supported by the following experiment. Epoxidation of cis-cyclooctene using complex 3 as a catalyst gave 6.4% yield (based on alkene taken) of the epoxide in 45 min (see Table 3). Upon addition of iodosylbenzene, the colour of the solution changed from reddish-brown to green, and after 45 min, when all the iodosylbenzene had been consumed, the solution was restored to its original colour. Charging the additional quantity (0.5 mmol) of PhIO and stirring the mixture, the colour again changed to green, and after 45 min the original colour was again restored. Analysis of the mixture showed that the yield of epoxide had nearly doubled. Similarly, repeating the addition of PhIO (0.5 mmol) five times resulted in a fivefold increase in the yield of epoxide. The catalyst 283 TABLE 3 Oxidation of cis-cyclooctene by stepwise addition of PhlO using complex 3 as a catalyst' Amount of PhIO Yield of epoxide Turnover numberb (mmol) (g'o) based on Phl0 based on alkene 0.5 32 6.4 16 1.0 33 13.2 33 1.5 34 20.4 51 2.0 34 27.2 68 2.5 34 34.0 85 BAlkene 2.5 mmol; catalyst 0.01 mmol; solvent: water-dioxane (1:6, v/v). bMoles of epoxide per mole of catalyst. showed a turnover number of 85. However, the percent utilization of PhIO for epoxide formation remained practically the same. Cyclic voltammetric study The mononuclear complex, 1 shows a first reduction potential at + 0.11 V and another at - 0.48 V, which correspond to Ru(IV) /Ru(III) and Ru(III)/Ru(II), respectively. Similarly, oxidation potentials were observed at -0.25 V and +0.34 V for Ru(II)/Ru(III) and Ru(III)/Ru(IV) respectively. In binuclear complexes the redox couple appears in a similar potential range, indicating that both the Ru(III) centres are equivalent, with no interaction between them. The systems are found to be reversible. An attempt was made to study the redox potential of the intermediate brown and green species. To a complex 1 solution in water-dioxane (1:1 v/v) a stoichiometric amount of iodosylbenzene was added, and the mixture was stirred under nitrogen atmosphere for 10 min, until the solution turned green. The cyclic voltammogram of the green solution, the probable Ru(V)-oxo, shows a shift in the redox potential as compared with the original complex. The cyclic voltammogram of the Ru(V)-oxo complex 1 shows two reduction potentials at + 0.16 V and - 0.62 V, which correspond to Ru(V)/Ru(IV) and Ru(IV)/Ru(III) reduction, respectively. The oxidation potentials were observed at - 0.34 V and + 0.43 V for Ru(III) /Ru(IV) and RU(IV) /Ru(V) oxidation, respectively. The binuclear complexes 2 and 3 also show similar redox potentials in the presence of an oxidant (see Rg. 1). This shows that Ru(III) in the complex becomes oxidized to Ru =O and can reversibly return to Ru(III). The CV study shows that there is no formation of a A.-oxo species, which causes termination of catalytic activity. The rates of the epoxidation of cis-cyclooctene using the binuclear metal complexes, 2 and 3, were nearly twice that using the corresponding mononuclear complex, 1 (Fig. 2). This indicates that in binuclear complexes, both of the metal centres actively participate in the reaction. 284 -1.0 I I / i r / i r / I / v II I / / ~~_/I 1 / I / l + 1.2 Fig. 1.

The fact that the rate of epoxidation of olefin using the binuclear complexes is not exactly double that in the case of the mononuclear complex, supports the formation of metallaoxetane as an intermediate, with olefin bound to the metal oxo. In a binuclear complex, there may be steric hindrance to the simultaneous approach of the olefin molecules to both metal centres, resulting in a lowering of their catalytic activity. Epoxidation of norbornene was carried out with t-butyl hydroperoxide as an oxidant, using all three complexes as catalysts. It was observed that during the reaction t-butyl hydroperoxide was consumed at a slower rate 285 than PhIO. Complexes 1-3 gave 5ss'o yield (based on t-butyl hydroperoxide charged) of norbornene oxide in 45 min, which increased to 13, 19, and 23%, respectively, upon stirring the mixture for 24 h. Conclusion It is thus observed that in the present binuclear complexes, the two metal centres are equivalent, as indicated by electrochemical and ESR studies. All the complexes are stable under the conditions of the oxidation reaction. As catalysts, the binuclear complexes are nearly twice as effective as the corresponding mononuclear complex.

Rates of the epoxidation of cis-cyclooctene using binuclear complexes were found to be nearly twice those using the mononuclear ones, indicating participation of both the metal centres of the former in the reaction. The absence of μ-oxo reaction product was shown by cyclic voltammetric studies. The mechanism of the reaction is suggested. References 1 E.P. Guengerich T.L. MacDonald Acc. Chem.
