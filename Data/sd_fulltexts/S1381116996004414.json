F-59652 Villeurbanne Cedex, France Received 18 July 1996; accepted 12 November 1996 Abstract Sucrose-butadiene telomerization is efficiently carried out in water or water-organic medium in the presence of a palladium salt and TPPTS (TPPTS = trisodium tris(m-sulfonatophenyl)phosphine as catalyst. Mono- and dioctadienylether compounds are selectively obtained using a NaOH 1 M/isopropanol mixture. Keywords: Sucrose; Butadiene; TPPTS; Telomerization 1. Introduction The telomerization of butadiene with alcohols, for which the most appropriate catalysts are based on palladium compounds, has now been studied for a long time [1,2]. A wide variety of nucleophiles has been used including phenol [3] as well as a protected galactopyranose [4]. The use of carbohydrates as nucleophiles leads to hydrophobic alkyl glucosides. These products show interesting physicalchemical properties of surfactants and have the advantage of being biodegradable. Furthermore, they possess good compatibility properties towards the skin. They are also used in detergent formulations and emulsifiers in cosmetics and food [5]. The selective monoetherification of ' Corresponding author. 1381-1169/97/$17.00 Copyright 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. PH S 1381-1169(96)00441-4 unprotected sucrose remains a particularly difficult task because of the small differences in the activation energies among the several classes of the OH groups. Recently, Hill et al. have described a direct route for telomerizatiotl of butadiene with sucrose in the presence of a Pd(II)/PPh3 system in a mixture of propan-2-of and water [6,7]. Sucrose octadienyl ethers were obtained with an average degree of substitution of 4.7-5.3. However, the presence of 2-propyloctadienylether and butadiene dimers in the crude product was also observed. We describe here some hydrosoluble palladium catalyst systems that enable the straightforward telomerization of butadiene with sucrose in water or water-organic medium [8]. The mono- and dioctadienylethers were obtained in high yield with a small amount of side products identified as butadiene dimers ( < 2%). 140 OH O OHOO O~ OH + n HO OH OH L Pennequin et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 120 (1997) 139-142 ~ri o H O HO O R2 OH OH OH R,=C8H12, Rz=H (65%) R1=H> R2=C8H12 (18%) + di-, tri-, tethers Scheme 1. Despite the use of water as solvent, no octadienols which could arise from the telomerization of butadiene with water were formed (Scheme 1). The catalyst system was formed from palladium diacetate and trisodium tris( m-sulfonatophenyl)phosphine (TPPTS). 2. Experimental In a typical experiment, sucrose (8 g, 23.4 mmol), Pd(OAc)2 (20 mg, 0.09 mmol) and TPPTS (150 mg, 0.27 mmol) were weighted and introduced into a 100 ml stainless steel double walled autoclave equipped with a magnetic stirrer. After a nitrogen purge the degassed solvent were added. The autoclave was frozen at -10 and liquid butadiene (15 g, 278 mmol) was transferred. The mixture was then heated to 80, in which case the pressure increased to 11 bar corresponding to the butadiene vapor pressure at that temperature. After reaction, the autoclave was cooled and degassed. A light yellow monophasic solution was generally obtained unless ketones were used. The solvents were evaporated under vacuo and analyzed by gas chromatography (CP Sil SCB, length 25 m, internal diameter: 0.22 mm). The crude products were analyzed after peracetylation with a mixture of acetic anhydride and pyridine by GC with a high temperature SGE HT 5 0.1 column (length: 25 m, internal diameter: 0.32 mm). The telomerization products were also characterized Pd(II)/IPPTS by positive FAB (matrix: thioglycerol/sodium NaOH IM acetate). The different telomers fractions were separated by flash chromatography. From the monoethers fraction, each telomer was isolated by preparative HPLC on a C 1g column (Spheri sorb ODS 2, 25 cm length, 10.5 mm internal diameter) using MeCN/HZO (20/80: v/v) as eluent and fully characterised by NMR ' H and '3C DEPT technics [9]. The structure of major monoethers and their relative amounts in this fraction were as depicted in Scheme 1. 3. Results and discussion The telomerization reaction was first exam ined in aqueous medium. The results are re ported in Table 1. Using water alone, the sucrose conversion was only 65 % after 5 h (entry 1). The peracety lated reaction mixture was found to be com posed mainly of about 36% mono- and 480 di-O-octadienyl compounds. An increase of the reaction time allowed to reach a 90% conver sion, but led to an enhancement of the average number of substitutions on the OH groups (en try 2). In this latter case, the di- and trisubsti tuted ethers were the main products. The introduction of sodium hydroxide re sulted in a large increase of the catalytic activity so that the reaction went to completion within 2.5 h (entry 3). The reaction rate was so effec tive that after only 26 min, 87% of sucrose was converted into di- and triethers. In this latter case, the degree of substitution remained quite high (entry 4, N = 2.4). An optimised time of 23 min has allowed to obtain a good compro mise between the sucrose conversion and the substitution degree (entry 5). In order to im prove the monotelomers selectively, the butadi ene quantity has been decreased but in such cases the activity decreased simultaneously con siderably. For example, with a butadiene/sucrose ratio of 3, no reaction oc curred. I.

Sucrose telomers selectivities according to the solvent (Conv. > 98%>. alytic activity was observed, probably due to a better butadiene solubilization into the liquid phase. Another approach was to use an hydroalco holic solution of sucrose which has already been reported by H. Cie using triphenylphosphine as ligand [6]. Actually the above results were im- proved by introducing isopropylalcohol. In our References case, a 66% selectivity into monooctadienyl ethers was obtained at a 73% conversion which corresponds to a 48o monoethers yield (entry 3, Table 2). Interestingly, no isopropyloctadi enylether was observed. Selected results ob tained with various solvents are summarised in Fig. 1. We also studied the effect of a non-hydro soluble ligand using a mixture of water and isopropanol like those retained for entry 9, Table 2. In this latter case, when PPh3 was used instead TPPTS, the reaction did not occur at all. This result arose from a too low solubility of PPh3 in that case. ' 1 In our hands, Hill telomerization conditions using PPh3 gave the results obtained by this group, due to a much higher iPrOH/H20 ratio allowing a good solubilization of the ligand. A series of experiments to optimize this reaction has been performed. Varying the amount of alcohol had a major effect on the reaction rate and selectivity (entries 3 to 6): a high conversion (90%) was obtained with an alcohol/water ratio of 1 together with a low substitution degree. The use of isopropylalcohol allowed to obtain selectively the sucrose mono- and dioctadienylether compounds, which appear to be less reactive in the mixture alcohol/alkaline solution than in other solvents (entry 9, Table 2 versus entry 3, Table 1 and entries 1-2, Table 2). In this latter case, only small amounts of tetraethers were obtained even at an almost complete sucrose conversion. The extension of this reaction to others carbohydrates is currently under investigation. Acknowledgements We thank Beghin-Say financial support. C ie and the CNRS for [1] R.F.
