Graphic In this paper, plasma treatment of Ni catalyst for partial oxidation of methane to syngas was investigated by using plate–plate discharge model via a corona discharge by flowing argon under atmospheric pressure and room temperature. The catalytic activity and stability for partial oxidation of methane (POM) process were measured for the catalyst before and after plasma treatment. It was found that after plasma treatment, methane conversion increased 5–10% and the syngas selectivity kept the same as before treatment. Also, these catalysts were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis and XPS measurement. It was found that the argon plasma treatment can improve the catalytic stability by preventing the carbon deposition on the Ni catalyst. Keywords Plasma Ni Partial oxidation Methane 1 Introduction The catalytic partial oxidation of methane is an attractive way to produce syngas. Of the reported catalysts, a supported Ni catalyst is a promising catalyst for partial oxidation of methane (POM) process since it has a high activity and a low price [1–4]. However, the catalytic stability of Ni catalysts is not so desirable and the catalyst deactivates with time by the carbon deposition, the nickel sintering and loss, and by the phase transformation, which limits its further industrial application. In the past years, many researchers managed to improve the catalytic stability of Ni catalyst by addition of promoters to Ni catalyst or modifying the catalyst preparation method [5–8] but no breakthrough was obtained. The field of materials surface modification by cold plasma treatment has been used in the surface modification of polymers, for which there now exist numerous industrial applications. So, using plasma to treat catalyst surface to improve catalytic activity and stability is considered reasonable. In this paper, plasma treatment of Ni catalyst for POM to syngas was investigated by using plate–plate discharge model via a corona discharge by flowing Ar. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The catalyst was prepared by an impregnation method. The required amount of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O was slowly added to the support (diameter of 3–5mm) to obtain the catalyst. After impregnation, the sample was dried at 120°C for 2h and calcined at 400°C for 4h, and then calcined at 800°C for 8h. Finally, the sample was reduced at 500 or 800°C by hydrogen for 2h. 2.2 Plasma treatment The plasma treat experiment of Ni catalyst for partial oxidation of methane to syngas was carried out in a continuous system by using plate–plate ac discharge model under atmospheric pressure and room temperature by flowing argon. The breakdown voltage for Ar corona was 20kV and the discharge voltage is 40kV for plasma treatment. The flow rate of Ar is 20ml/min. The plates were inserted into a quartz tube with inner diameter of 14mm. The distance between the two plates was 30mm. Each time 3.0g catalyst was treated for 4min by plasma technique. 2.3 Catalyst evaluation A quartz tube of dimension of 5mm o.d.×3mm i.d.×300mm length was used as a reactor. The catalyst amounts were 60mg. The reaction temperature was 800°C and the space velocity was 1.0×105 h−1 with the mole ratio of CH4:O2:N2 as 2:1:1. High purity Ar was used as the carrier gas for GC analysis of the inlet and outlet gas mixtures. The conversion and selectivity were calculated from the GC analysis results based on 100% C, H, O, and N mass balance. 2.4 TPR, TPO measurement and chemisorption Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were performed using an automatic TPR/TPD 2910 adsorption instrument by passing 10vol.% H2/Ar mixed gas with a flow rate of 20ml/min. Temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) experiment was performed by passing 5vol.% O2/He mixed gas with a flow rate of 20ml/min. The amount of catalysts used was 100mg and the temperature was increased at a rate of 10°C/min to 900°C. H2 chemisorption on reduced Ni catalyst was measured by titration 5% H2/Ar mixed gas. The Ni dispersion on the support can be calculated from H2 chemisorption amount. 2.5 Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis Thermogravimetric experiments were carried out in a TA-50 thermal analysis system. The experiment was conducted using N2 gas (99.99%) and air (99.99%) at flow rates of 20 and 30ml/min, respectively. Samples (about 20mg) were loaded into the thermobalance and heated to 800°C at a controlled heating rate of 10°C/min until a constant weight was achieved. The weight loss rate was recorded simultaneously. 2.6 XPS characterization XPS analyses employed a multi-pass analyzer (PHI 1600) with pass energy of 188eV for survey spectra and 29eV for high-resolution spectra. X-rays were generated using a Mg Kα X-ray source. 2.7 XRD measurement XRD measurement was done using D/max-2500 XRD instrument. X-ray source was Cu Kα. The voltage is 50kV and the electric current is 200mA. The scanning rate is 4–8°/min and the scanning range is 2θ=3–80°. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalytic performance The catalytic activity of Ni catalyst after Ar plasma treatment was measured and shown in Figs. 1 and 2 . It was found that the methane conversion increased after plasma treatment while the CO selectivity kept the same value as before treatment. In order to know what change occurred on the Ni catalyst surface after plasma treatment, a series characterization were made and discussed in the following parts. 3.2 XRD results XRD measurement for three catalysts before and after Ar plasma treatment were shown in Fig. 3 . It can be seen that the XRD spectra after plasma treatment is nearly same as before plasma treatment. No apparent change was observed from XRD results. The reason is that during the plasma treatment the temperature is kept about room temperature, which could not result in the crystal change of the catalyst. 3.3 TPR, TPO results and H2 chemisorption TPR and TPO profile shown in Fig. 4 proved that the oxidative and reductive performance of the catalyst has little change after Ar plasma treatment. Table 1 shows that after Ar plasma treatment, H2 chemisorption amount and Ni dispersion increased, which is one of the reasons result in the increase of methane conversion. Also, the increase of Ni dispersion may be beneficial for the catalytic stability, which was further proved by TG results. 3.4 Carbon deposition by TG results The weight loss data for different catalysts after the POM reaction are listed in Table 2 . It can be seen that the carbon deposition decreased after the catalyst was treated by Ar plasma. Fig. 5 shows the weight loss rate of 10% Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts after POM reaction. After plasma treatment, the 10% Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst showed a lower and narrower temperature peak. Other catalysts showed the similar results. These results proved that the plasma treatment is beneficial for preventing the carbon deposition on the Ni catalyst. 3.5 The surface modification Fig. 6 shows the comparison of high-resolution XPS spectra of Ni 2p before and after Ar plasma treatment. It can be seen that the Ni0 increased after Ar plasma treatment. Since the reduced Ni is the active site for POM reaction, it is obvious that Ni0 increase on the surface results in the catalytic activity increase. 4 Conclusion Ar plasma treatment can increase the catalytic activity of Ni catalyst and the Ni dispersion. Also, the plasma treatment improved the catalytic stability by preventing carbon deposition on the Ni catalyst.

        "dc:description": "In this paper, plasma treatment of Ni catalyst for partial oxidation of methane to syngas was investigated by using plate–plate discharge model via a corona discharge by flowing argon under atmospheric pressure and room temperature. The catalytic activity and stability for partial oxidation of methane (POM) process were measured for the catalyst before and after plasma treatment. It was found that after plasma treatment, methane conversion increased 5–10% and the syngas selectivity kept the same as before treatment. Also, these catalysts were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis and XPS measurement. It was found that the argon plasma treatment can improve the catalytic stability by preventing the carbon deposition on the Ni catalyst.",
