It is shown that a model consisting of a constant and a monoexponential term describes the deactivation rate data very well suggesting that the catalytic activity of nickel is controlled by two components. One component seems to show a steady catalytic activity where the activity of the other component appears to decline exponentially. Transient tracing of the methanation on Raney nickel using ~3CO indicates that these correspond to two forms of intermediates adsorbed on two distinct catalyst sites. These findings are supported by rigorous statistical analyses of the correlation between model parameters and the goodness of the fit of data to the model. Keywords: Methanation; Nickel; Plug-flow reactor I. Introduction For a long time our interest in catalysis has been the identification of the mechanisms of methanation over nickel. We have used 13CO and deuterium tracer data to investigate the mechanisms of this reaction. In our earlier works using Harshaw nickel catalyst we observed that the methanation activity of nickel drops substantially as the ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide is reduced in the feed. By way of modeling, we found out that this phenomenon * Corresponding author. 09~6-860X/97/$17.00 Copyright 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. PII S0926- 860X(96)0029 1 - 8 98 M. Otarod et aL /Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997) 97-107 corresponds to a high concentration of intermediates. Throughout our work with nickel, we consistently found out that a high concentration of intermediates was associated with a lower level of methanation activity. Our recent work [1] with Raney nickel using a different model resulted in the identification of two types of intermediates in two parallel paths both contributing to the production of methane. From our tracer data, we concluded that the catalytic activity of Raney nickel is controlled by the concentration of two forms of intermediates which are adsorbed on two distinct catalyst sites. One form which we called Ni-1 appears to exhibit a high level of activity when the catalyst is fresh but is more readily prone to a loss in its activity. The other site which we denoted by Ni-2 shows a lower level of activity but possesses a more enduring catalytic characteristic such that its catalytic activity remains fairly constant over long times on stream. The present work is an attempt to combine the results of our recent work [1] using tracer data with conventional plug flow rate data on methanation to identify a model which adequately describes the deactivation of Raney nickel in time. Here, we will present a model consisting of parallel first order kinetics to describe the deactivation data. A detailed statistical analysis of the model versus data will be presented to demonstrate the appropriateness of our model in describing the deactivation data. Current literature has focused little on model identification using a rigorous analysis of the statistics resulting from curve fitting procedures. The statistical data on modeling such as correlation matrix and the goodness of fit can and should be used exhaustively to distinguish between competing models. We will show a rigorous application of these statistics as a means to distinguish among competing models. 2. Experimental The bulk of data used in this article was reported in our previous work [1]. More data on nickel deactivation are reported here. The experiments were conducted by [2] who measured the methanation activity of Raney nickel for times on stream of up to 313 h. These experiments were conducted in a plug-flow reactor running at high space velocities corresponding to differential conversions. The detail of the experiments are given by Soong et al., and the results are reported in Table 1. In the study by Soong et al., only five of the ten data points (marked by asterisks) involved transient tracing of the steady state reactions. All studies corresponded to a H2/CO ratio of 2 and at a constant temperature of 210. 3. Modeling catalyst deactivation data The correlation of transient data from our previous work was supplemented by the additional overall rate data obtained by Soong et al. without conducting M.

These data are more readily obtained using conven- tional differential plug flow experiments. The tracer data enabled clear demonstration to be made that the step velocities could be well modelled by assuming a model structure involving two parallel paths. Examination of Fig. 5 of the previous paper shows that these two paths present different characteristics. The major proportion of activity is associated with the species Ni-1 that seems to be associated with the finely divided nickel comprising the fresh catalyst. Methanation by this species decreases exponentially, approaching a relatively constant value. A second component with much lower but relatively constant activity corresponds to the species Ni-2. This component may be associated with the formation of an active carbonaceous intermediate. In experiments that we have conducted on methana- tion [3] it has been observed that freshly reduced catalyst did not attain full activity until contacted with CO containing feed gases; which lends support to this possibility. Examination of experimental data reveals that catalytic activity does not die out abruptly but asymptotically reaches a steady state value and stays at that level for a long time compared to the time frames that concern our study. Hence, if V is the methanation activity then V= a + be-e' (3.1) We obtained a least square fit of the data in Table 1 using Eq. (3.l). Estimates of the parameters are reported in Table 2. Using the values of the parameters we have V = 0.0691 + 0.0300 e-zTzt, t = hours (3.2) The agreement between the data and model appears to be very close. The small standard deviations of parameters a, b and c indicate that they are 100 M.

A short discussion of how to use the information provided by the correlation matrix is given in Appendix A. The experimental data and the corresponding values generated by the model and the residuals are listed in Table 2. Concerning a criterion to establish the goodness of fit between the model and data we will adopt the nomenclature in [1] and proceed as follows. We observe that the model parameters are estimated by minimizing the sum of squares of the residuals j(0): 1 N j(O) = -~ Y'~. [ Y(ti) = Ym(ti,O)]2 (3.3) l where N is the number of data points, y(ti) the rate measured at time ti Ym(ti, 0) the rate predicted by Eq. (3.2) and 0 = (a,b,c)r, the vector of parameters. In general, for nonlinear systems an exact solution 0 which minimizes j cannot always be obtained. Hence, as an alternative, a 0 is sought which gives a best fit to the data. This concept of best fit introduces statistical uncertainty into the system. Thus the parameters are assigned a standard error as a measure of uncertainty in their estimated value. Often little attention is paid to the statistical nature of the best fit itself to find out if the model is, at least statistically, a 'good' representative of the data. A small value of j is often taken as a satisfactory measure of a good fit. Although such a criterion can lead to the Table 2 The results of nonlinear regression Time on stream (h) V, experimental data (ml/s/g catal.) V, model (ml/s/g catal.)

Several methods are available to check statistically whether a fit is a good fit. Among them are the test of the number of runs, Kolmogorov and Shapiro-Wilk tests of goodness of fit, etc. All of these methods require the computation of a statistic representing the data to compare to a standard quantity, the quantile of a distribution (normally tabulated in statistics books), which is derived from theoretical development of the method. For a detailed discussion of the statisti- cal methods consult [4]. We chose and applied the Kolmogorov test of goodness of fit to the deactivation data. We found out that the distribution of the residuals satisfy the Kolmogorov test of normality (Appendix A) supporting our assumption that Eq. (3.2) properly represents a model which describes the deactivation data. The interested reader should consult Appendix A for a detailed discussion of the application of the Kolmogorov test of the goodness of fit. 4. Discussion The study described here represents a new approach to the characterization of catalyst deactivation. This subject is one of great interest, having been treated to date in six symposia, the latest concluded in Ostend, Belgium [5]. As noted in [6] and [7] deactivation is a complicated phenomenon. In the present studies using Raney nickel catalyst for methanation, the previous investigation [2] had indicated that the catalyst aging could be inferred to proceed via two parallel pathways. In a further development of this model [1] we showed how this model could be quantified so as to obtain numerical values for the parameters involved. As shown in the present study the conclusions arrived at by transient tracing can serve as a basis for further evaluation of deactivation data. In this study, the major contribution to catalyst deactivation in methanation appears to be related to sintering of the Ni-1 catalyst component. Separate studies of supported metal sintering have often used power law rate forms for correlation of sintering rates. Fuentes and Gamas [8] noted that these expression resulted in the prediction of zero dispersion after a sufficiently long period of time and proposed a general- ized power-law equation (GPLE) to describe the fact that usually a non-zero limiting dispersion is observed. This GPLE when integrated results in an expression that is similar to our Eq. (3.2) when the sintering order is one. Bartholomew [9] has applied this type of power law model to kinetic studies of sintering. Somewhat similar expressions have been used to correlate data on catalyst deactivation [10]. It would be of interest to study the applicability of the approach in this study to problems of this type. The use of tracer transients presents the possibility of 102 M.

Otarod et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997) 97-107 assess the goodness of fit between the model and data. However, a normal distribution of the residuals would suggest mathematical agreement between the data and model. To see this, let M represent the points generated by the model and D the experimental data points. If R represents the residuals, then M - D = R, for all datapoints (5.3) Ideally, a perfect match between the model and data would result in R being 0 everywhere for all data points. This does not happen too often though! As an alternative, we may settle for the case where residuals compare to the probabilis- tic distribution of the errors of measurement and therefore, be normally dis- tributed with mean /z and variance or 2. We expect IX, if not zero, to be very small. Hence, for M to be a good representation of D, the random variable (M - D) should be normally distributed with mean IX and variance or 2. This we denote as (M-O)~92(IX,Or2) (5.4) From (5.4) it follows that (M-D)-IX ~ 92 (0,1) = the standard normal (5.5) or Now, since ((M-D)- Ix)/o- is a standard normal random variable, with probability (1 - a), it assumes values which fall within a confidence interval of length 2z,~/2, where z,~/2 is the a/2 quantile of the standard normal distribu- tion. This implies that if a sample from the population of ((M - D) - Ix)/o- is taken, only 100a points out of every 100 times it is sampled will fall within the two far ends of the bell shaped curve which is called the critical region. Due to the symmetry in the probability density function of the standard normal variable, we choose z,~/2 such that a 1 (x- ~)2 1 (x - ~)2 -~ =,_~f-z~/2--e~or 2~2 dx= f;~/2 ~o.e 2~2 dx (5.6) In Eq. (5.6) the integral on the left gives the area under the standard normal curve for quantiles in the interval ( - ~, - z~/2) and the integral on the left gives the area under the curve for quantiles which are in the interval (z~/2, ~). The area under the bell shaped curve between -z~/2 to a2/2 is (1 - a). Therefore, if ((M- D) - Ix~a) is normally distributed, with probability (1 - a) (M-D)-IX -z,~/2 < < z~/2 (5.7) Or Solving for M we will obtain D + Ix - oz,~/2 < D + Ix + oz,~/2 (5.8) implying that with probability (1 - a), the points M generated by the model are M. Otarod et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997) 97-107 105 no farther from the experimental data points than /x + o-zc</2. But then, this is the criterion for accepting the null hypothesis H0 as opposed to the alternative hypothesis Ha: H0: M = D, M represents the data D properly (5.9) Ha: M D, M does not (5.10) For the residuals listed in Table 3, /x = 0.0 and o-= 0.000982. At a signifi- cance level of o~ = 0.05 we have z,~/2 = 1.96. If we substitute these into Eq. (5.8) we will have D- 0.0019 < D + 0.0019 (5.11) Eq. (5.11) indicates that with 95% probability only 5% of the residuals may fall outside the interval (- 0.0019, 0.0019). But since 5% of ten residuals is 0.5 points, we should expect that no more than one residual fall outside the above interval. This observation is confirmed by an inspection of the residuals. We choose a normal distribution of the residuals with a small mean and standard deviation as a measure of the goodness of fit because it almost mimics the ideal fit that we mentioned before. There are several statistical methods to examine the normality of the distribu- tion of residuals. The Kolmogorov test seems to be the method of choice for our study. According to [4], at a significance level of a, the residuals are normally distributed if the Kolmogorov test statistic T1 = suplF(x)-S(x)l does not exceed w~_~l the (1 - c~) quantile of the Kolmogorov probability distribution. This implies that, if the residuals are normally distributed, with probability (1 -a) the supremum of the absolute value of the differences between F(x) and S(x) will fall within the interval S(x) +_ tol_~. For a sample of size 10 at a = 0.05, Conover gives O9o.95 = 0.409. We computed T1 = 0.181. Since T1 < O9o.95 the residuals pass the Kolmogorov normality test with 95% probability, supporting the goodness of fit between Eq. (3.1) and data. Another useful statistic usually obtained from a regression analysis is the correlation matrix. The off-diagonal elements of a correlation matrix are each the correlation coefficients between two parameters and are used as a measure of their independence. A value close to 0 of an element of the correlation matrix usually indicates independence and a value close to 1 or -1 dependence between parameters. One should be cautious though in using the correlation coefficient as the measure of independence between parameters. A small value of a correlation coefficient is not always an indicator of stochastic independence. As an example (see [11]), consider random variables A and B = A2, where A assumes values of _+ 1 and _+2 each with probability 1/4. The correlation coefficient between A and B turns out to be zero while A and B are completely dependent. Although a discussion of the statistical distribution of the correlation coefficients is outside the scope of this article, it should be noted that, apart from exceptional cases such as this, the correlation coefficient, like any other 106 M.

Tables giving the quantiles of the correlation coefficients are available in many statistic books. See Bickel and Doksum [12] for a discussion and further references. Nonetheless, as a rule of thumb, a value of correlation coefficient less that 0.8 is more likely to satisfy the independence hypothesis between parameters. We used this rule to give our interpretation of the correlation matrix. For a detailed discussion of these methods see [13,4,11]. As an example, we sought a fit between the methanation rate data and a biexponential model V = a + be-el + de-el. The results of the regression are reported in Table 4, and the correlation matrix for this model follows. [(rij)], [i,j= 1 ..... 4] = 1.00 ) 0.35 1.00 0.76 0.83 1.00 - 0.54 - 0.92 - 0.89 1.00 0.41 0.88 0.74 - 0.79 1.00 The sum of squares of errors (Table 4) being equal to 0.00000702 indicates that the biexponential model gives a closer fit to the data than our model for which the sum of squares of the errors was 0.00001 which is one order of magnitude greater than that for the biexponential model. The biexponential model also passed the test of normality of the residuals indicating that the fit was satisfactory, not the result of artifacts. Yet we rejected this model in favor of Eq. (3.2) for two reasons. First, the standard deviation of parameters d and e are comparable to the value of the parameter themselves indicating that they are not statistically well determined. In addition the small value of d = 0.0040 and the large value of e = 0.1281 indicate that the second exponential will tend to zero very quickly so that for example, its contribution to the rate after 20 h on stream is 0.0003 (ml/s/g) only, Second, the correlation matrix contains ele- ments which are close to 1 or -1. For instance, r42 = 0.92 and r43 = 0.89 indicating a large correlation between d and b and between d and c, respec- tively. These high values are likely to support the hypothesis of the dependence of these parameters. In general, large values of the correlation coefficients indicate that there are more parameters in the model than can be supported by data. M.

Deactivation of Raney nickel is studied using the methanation rate data in a plug-flow reactor. It is shown that a model consisting of a constant and a monoexponential term describes the deactivation rate data very well suggesting that the catalytic activity of nickel is controlled by two components. One component seems to show a steady catalytic activity where the activity of the other component appears to decline exponentially. Transient tracing of the methanation on Raney nickel using13CO indicates that these correspond to two forms of intermediates adsorbed on two distinct catalyst sites. These findings are supported by rigorous statistical analyses of the correlation between model parameters and the goodness of the fit of data to the model.
