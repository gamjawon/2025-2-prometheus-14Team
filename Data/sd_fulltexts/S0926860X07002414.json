Graphical abstract Pure β-MoO3 was successfully synthesized through evaporation of a molybdic acid solution containing HNO3, whereas α-MoO3 was selectively produced from the HNO3-free solution. Compared to the α-form, β-MoO3 had the larger amount and higher acidity of Lewis acid sites on the surface, and thereby exhibited much higher catalytic activity in partial oxidation of methanol. Two types of molybdenum trioxide were synthesized by evaporating the molybdic acid solution prepared via cation-exchange of an aqueous solution of Na2MoO4·2H2O. When the molybdic acid solution was evaporated to dryness at 323K under reduced pressure and then calcined at 573K in a stream of oxygen, α-MoO3 was exclusively produced. However, addition of HNO3 to the solution before the evaporation resulted in formation of a bright yellow powder which was identified as β-MoO3. The phase ratio of β/α was dependent on the quantity of HNO3; pure β-MoO3 was successfully synthesized when the molar ratio of HNO3/Mo in the solution was in the range of 1–2. It was also found that the HNO3 addition made no structural change of the isopolymolybdates in the solution and the dried precursor, but did affect the dehydration of the dried precursor to induce the crystallization of the β-phase. In partial oxidation of methanol, β-MoO3 exhibited much higher methanol conversion than the α-form. IR spectra of chemisorbed pyridine elucidated that the higher catalytic activity was caused by the relatively large number and high acidity of Lewis acid sites on the surface of β-MoO3. Keywords β-MoO3 α-MoO3 Selective synthesis Methanol oxidation Acid property 1 Introduction Since molybdenum oxide is the major component of the catalysts for selective oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde in a large excess of air, there have been many studies on the catalytic behavior of pure MoO3 [1–6]. Orthorhombic α-MoO3, which is the most thermodynamically stable phase of molybdenum trioxide, exhibits high selectivity to formaldehyde, but the activity is much lower compared to the industrially used ferric molybdate catalysts with excess molybdenum [1–8]. Farneth et al. [7,8] have investigated the chemisorption and reaction of methanol on α-MoO3 using temperature-programmed desorption and have described the mechanism of methanol oxidation involving dissociative chemisorption, rate-limiting C–H bond cleavage of the adsorbed intermediate, and reoxidation by molecular oxygen. They demonstrated that an important factor that limits the catalytic activity of α-MoO3 was relatively low coverage of the intermediate, Mo(OCH3), that could be produced on the surface of polycrystalline α-MoO3 powders by the dissociative chemisorption of methanol. According to their consideration, the low saturation coverage is attributable to the layered solid-state structure of α-MoO3, in which the major (010) crystal face is coordinatively-saturated and the metal atoms are not easily accessible to incoming alcohol ligands. Consequently, it is expected that molybdate-based catalysts on which there are more coordinatively-unsaturated metal sites have a high capacity for dissociative chemisorption and a high catalytic activity for partial oxidation of methanol. In 1985, McCarron [9] succeeded in synthesis of a new type of molybdenum trioxide, β-MoO3, through spray drying of a molybdic acid solution via cation-exchange of a sodium molybdate solution. X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy indicated that β-MoO3 has the ReO3-like structure in which MoO6 octahedra share the corners only with each other, whereas in α-MoO3, they share the corners and edges. β-MoO3 is the metastable phase of molybdenum trioxide and is transformed into the more stable α-form by heating at above 673K. Machiels et al. [10] have demonstrated that β-MoO3 is a more active catalyst than the α-phase with regard to the selective oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde. In fact, it has been proved by temperature-programmed reaction spectroscopy that the β-phase has more surface adsorption sites for methoxy groups from methanol which are oxidized to formaldehyde [11]. After the successful synthesis by McCarron [9], other preparative procedures of β-MoO3 have been reported [12–15]. Juárez Ramírez and Martínez-de la Cruz [15] have achieved the production of the β-MoO3 powder free from the α-phase by vacuum drying of the molybdic acid solution. They also found a high ability of β-MoO3 to form lithium molybdenum bronzes as an active material for lithium batteries [15,16]. However, this synthetic method had a disadvantage of slowness in the drying process: it required 36h to dry the solution in a 50-cm3 vessel. We have recently developed a simple and quick preparation route for pure β-MoO3 using a common rotary evaporator [17]. The key was the addition of a small amount of HNO3 into the precursory molybdic acid solution. Evaporation of the HNO3-added solution under reduced pressure, followed by calcination at 573K, resulted in formation of a bright yellow powder which was identified as pure β-MoO3, whereas a pale-green powder of α-MoO3 was exclusively obtained from the HNO3-free solution. In this study, we determined the necessary requirements for the selective synthesis of β-MoO3 and the role of HNO3 in the crystallization of β-MoO3. In addition, we compared the catalytic behaviors of α- and β-MoO3 in partial oxidation of methanol. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of β-MoO3 The precursory solution of molybdic acid was prepared from a 1mol/dm3 solution of Na2MoO4·2H2O. 1dm3 of the solution was passed through a column packed with 500cm3 of cation-exchange (CE) resin (Rohm and Haas, Amberlite IR120B Na) to remove Na+ ions. The resin was regenerated with 1mol/dm3 HCl solution (1dm3) and washed with distilled water until the pH was 7. These operations were repeated 10 times. 30cm3 of the obtained precursory solution was then poured into a 300-cm3 vessel and evaporated to dryness at 323K and 300–400Pa after addition of 1% HNO3 solution. The drying was completed within 1h. Molybdenum oxide was produced by heating the dried powder at the desired temperatures for 1h in an oxygen stream. 2.2 Characterization The Na content in the Mo solution was determined with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Shimadzu AA-660). XRD measurements were carried out using a Rigaku RINT2000 diffractometer with a copper X-ray tube operated at 30kV and 20mA. Structural information of the Mo atoms in the solutions, the dried precursors, and the calcined powders was obtained with a double-crystal EXAFS spectrometer (Rigaku R-EXAFS2000) equipped with Ge(660) and graphite(002) bent crystals. The X-ray generator with a rotating tungsten anode was operated at 40kV. The incident and transmitted X-ray intensities were monitored by an ionization chamber and a scintillation counter, respectively. The crystallization of molybdenum oxide from the dried precursor was investigated by thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) and thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS). The TG-DTA profile was obtained using a Mac Science TG8110 in an oxygen stream at a rate of temperature rise of 10K/min. In the TDS measurement, the sample (0.1g) was heated in vacuum at a rate of 10K/min and the emitted gases were detected with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Anelva AQA-200). Acidic property was estimated through IR spectra of chemisorbed pyridine. The calcined product (0.1g) was pressed into a disk of 10-mm diameter and evacuated at 573K for 1h in an in situ cell equipped with CaF2 windows. The sample was then exposed to approximately 1.3kPa of pyridine at room temperature and evacuated at the desired temperatures for 1h. IR spectra were recorded using a JASCO FT/IR-410 spectrometer with an MCT detector at a resolution of 4cm−1. 2.3 Partial oxidation of methanol Catalytic methanol oxidation was performed with a fixed-bed flow reactor. 4.3% methanol/air mixture was prepared by bubbling air into methanol at 273K and supplied to the sample (0.3g) placed in an 8-mm i.d. glass reactor at a flow rate of 200cm3/min. The reaction temperature was 473–723K. The gases passed through the catalyst bed were analyzed with two gas chromatographs (Shimadzu GC-8A): one was equipped with a 4-m column of ASP-201 for methanol and formaldehyde, and the other was equipped with a 2-m column of Carbosieve S-II for CO and CO2. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 The optimum conditions for synthesizing β-MoO3 The precursory molybdic acid solution was prepared by 10 CE treatments of the Na2MoO4 solution. The starting solution was colorless but it became tinged with blue by repeating the CE treatment. Changes in Na content and in the pH of the solution with the CE treatment are shown in Fig. 1 . The Na+ ions were exponentially decreased up to 8 CE cycles and the final concentration was approximately 1.5×10−5 mol/dm3. The pH was also lowered up to 4 CE cycles and then remained at approximately 1.5. By absorption spectroscopy using sodium thiocyanate, the Mo content in the final solution was determined to be 3.3×10−2 mol/dm3, which was equivalent to only 3.3% of the initial value. The MoO3 powder was obtained by evaporating the CE-treated solution (30cm3) doped with 1% HNO3 solution, followed by calcination at 573K for 1h in oxygen. Fig. 2 shows the XRD profiles of the calcined products with different HNO3 contents. In the absence of HNO3, the resultant powder was pale-green and its XRD pattern agreed completely with that of α-MoO3 (JCPDS 5–0508). Adding 1cm3 of the HNO3 solution resulted in a decrease in the peak intensities due to the α-phase and an appearance of the additional peaks at 23.0 and 25.0 degrees, which were assigned to the reflections from (011) and (200) lattice planes of β-MoO3 (JCPDS 47–1081), respectively. The phase ratio of β/α increased with increasing amount of HNO3 and finally pure β-MoO3 was produced when 7–12cm3 of the HNO3 solution was added. The powder was bright yellow. However, a further increase of the HNO3 amount brought about a reappearance of the α-phase. When the amount of the HNO3 solution was 100cm3, the β-phase was completely supplanted by the pale-green α-phase. Consequently, the optimum quantity of 1% HNO3 solution for the selective synthesis of β-MoO3 was 7–12cm3 for 30cm3 of the precursory Mo solution, which corresponded to a HNO3/Mo molar ratio of approximately 1–2. Fig. 3 illustrates the calcination-temperature dependence of the crystallographic structure of the powder prepared from the Mo solution containing 7cm3 of the HNO3 solution. No XRD peak was observed when the sample was treated at temperatures of 373K or lower. The peaks due to the β-phase appeared at 473K and grew by heating at 573K. However, the XRD profile at a calcination-temperature of 673K indicated the formation of pure α-MoO3; therefore β-MoO3 is the metastable phase of molybdenum trioxide which is transformed into the more thermodynamically stable α-phase at some temperature between 573 and 673K. We also prepared the powders from the Mo solutions at every CE cycle to elucidate the influence of the residual Na+ ions in the solution on the formation of β-MoO3. The volume ratio of 1% HNO3 solution to the Mo solution was 7/30 and the calcination-temperature was 573K. The XRD results are given in Fig. 4 . The powder obtained from the untreated solution exhibited three intense peaks due to Na2MoO4 at 16.9°, 27.7°, and 32.6°, as well as some very small peaks due to Na2Mo2O7. Most of the Na2MoO4 crystallites were converted into Na2Mo2O7 by the first CE. The second CE treatment resulted in a marked reduction of Na2Mo2O7 and an appearance of small peaks due to α-MoO3. The XRD patterns at the third and fourth CE were in agreement with that of the α-phase. β-MoO3 was first detected at the fifth CE treatment and grew with the CE number. The nearly pure β-phase was derived from the 8-CE-treated solution and the α-phase disappeared completely at a CE number of 9 and 10. By taking into account the results in Fig. 1, we found that the increase in the β/α phase ratio was intimately related to the reduction of the Na content in the solution rather than to the pH which was almost unchanged in the CE cycle range of 4–10. Indeed, by addition of NaCl to the 10-CE-treated Mo solution at a concentration of 1×10−3 mol/dm3, although the solution pH was not affected, the resulting powder was crystallographically changed to the α-phase. These results clearly indicate the inhibitory effect of Na+ ions on the synthesis of β-MoO3. 3.2 The role of HNO3 in the selective formation of β-MoO3 The chemical state of isopolymolybdates in the aqueous solution is influenced by the pH [18], and hence the cause of the β-MoO3 formation may be structural changes of the molybdate ions in the precursory solution by the HNO3 addition. Accordingly, we measured Mo K-edge EXAFS of the CE-treated Mo solutions, the dried precursors, and the calcined products without and with the HNO3 addition. The k 3-weighted EXAFS spectra and the associated Fourier transforms (FT) are shown in Fig. 5a and b, respectively. The results of the untreated Na2MoO4 solution are also included for comparison. Because the phase factor was not corrected in the EXAFS analysis, all of the peaks in Fig. 5b appeared at shorter interatomic distances than the real values. The raw Na2MoO4 solution showed the relatively monotonous EXAFS oscillation in Spectrum a1 and only one FT peak due to the Mo–O bonds in MoO4 2− ions at 0.132nm in Spectrum b1. By 10 CE treatments, the EXAFS curve became intricate and the amplitude was much lowered as is shown in Spectrum a2. The Mo–O peak in Spectrum b2 was shortened by 0.018nm and was notably weakened. In addition, a small peak appeared at 0.291nm. Curve fitting analysis of EXAFS can give information about the coordination numbers and interatomic distances around the X-ray-absorbing atoms, but it is often difficult for molybdenum oxides and molybdates because they have many different Mo–O and Mo–Mo interatomic distances. For example, Mo atom in α-MoO3 is surrounded by six O atoms at five different distances (0.1671, 0.1734, 0.1948×2, 0.2251, and 0.2332nm) with a disordered octahedral coordination [19]. In such a case, curve fitting result often converges at local minima with no physically meaningful values due to the strong correlation between the parameters. Accordingly, we gave up the curve fitting analysis in this study. Nevertheless, based on the interatomic distance, the new peak at 0.291nm in Spectrum b2 is most likely due to Mo–Mo, which suggests the change of the mononuclear molybdates, MoO4 2−, to polynuclear molybdates by the decrease in the solution pH [18]. Evaporating the solution to dryness resulted in the shift of the main Mo–O peak to 0.129nm and the appearance of an additional Mo–O peak at around 0.08nm in Spectrum b4. The EXAFS oscillation and the associated FT after the calcination at 573K (spectra a6 and b6, respectively) were equivalent to those of commercial α-MoO3. The EXAFS data of the CE-treated solution, the dried precursor, and the calcined product with the HNO3 addition are illustrated in spectra 3, 5, and 7, respectively. There is no evident difference between spectra 2 and 3, nor between spectra 4 and 5 in Fig. 5a and b. This not only excludes the structural change of the isopolymolybdates by the HNO3 addition but also excludes creation of new Mo compounds containing NO3 − ions in the solution and the dried precursor. However, spectra a7 and b7 for the calcined powder are quite different from spectra a6 and b6, respectively, indicating that the calcination is the most important process for the crystallization of β-MoO3. A conceivable effect of HNO3 is a decrease in the solution pH to induce the formation of the β-phase. However, this is eliminated by the experimental results that the HNO3 addition little affected the pH and the addition of HCl solution instead of HNO3 produced not β-MoO3 but α-MoO3; therefore, we suspected that the NO3 − ions played an important role during the calcination. In order to make this clear, we carried out the thermal analyses of the dried products. Fig. 6a and b shows DTA and TG profiles of the HNO3-free powder, respectively. The weight gradually decreased with increasing temperature and dropped steeply with a sharp endothermic peak at 508K. The differential TG (DTG) curve in Fig. 6c was in excellent agreement with the TDS profile of H2O in Fig. 6d; thus, the decrease in weight was attributable to dehydration of the dried product. The total weight loss was 14.3%, which corresponded to approximately 1.3 of n in MoO3·nH2O. After the final dehydration, an exothermic peak appeared at 573K without weight change. This peak was assigned to the crystallization of α-MoO3 by XRD. Fig. 6e–h illustrates the results for the dried precursor containing HNO3 at a HNO3/Mo molar ratio of approximately 1. Compared to the peak in Fig. 6a, the endothermic peak at 508K in Fig. 6e was markedly weakened and two additional endothermic peaks appeared at 420 and 470K. At almost the same temperatures, the weight losses due to dehydration were observed in the TG and DTG curves (Fig. 6f and g, respectively). A similar stepwise dehydration has been reported by Juárez Ramírez and Martínez-de la Cruz [15] in the synthesis of β-MoO3 from the vacuum-dried molybdic acid. The total weight loss was 15.7%, which was slightly larger than that in the absence of HNO3. A notable feature in the TDS profiles of the HNO3-doped sample (Fig. 6h) is the emission of NO and NO2 in the temperature range of 470–600K, indicating the decomposition of the remaining NO3 − ions during the final dehydration process. In Fig. 6e three exothermic peaks can be observed at 552, 580, and 660K. The highest-temperature peak was also detected for pure β-MoO3 [17]. Taking into account the XRD results in Fig. 3, we concluded that the β-phase was crystallized at 552 and/or 580K, and transformed into the α-phase at 660K. In addition, a small TDS peak of NO appeared at 667K in Fig. 6h despite a lack of the associated weight loss. This means that a tiny quantity of NO3 − ions remained in β-MoO3 and was completely decomposed with the phase transition of β into α at around 660K. As is shown in Fig. 2, β-MoO3 was not obtained by evaporation of the CE-treated solution in the absence of HNO3. However, the particular drying techniques such as spray drying [9], freeze drying [14], and vacuum drying [15] allowed the formation of the β-phase even from the HNO3-free solution, suggesting that the dehydration is the key process for the β-MoO3 synthesis. The thermal analyses in Fig. 6 clearly demonstrated that the NO3 − ions had a significant influence on the dehydration of the dried powder. Based on the above considerations, we concluded that the role of the NO3 − ions was to control the manner and strength of coordination of H2O molecules to MoO x in the dried precursor to form β-MoO3. When a larger excess of HNO3 was added, the dried precursor looked damp even after the evaporation for 5h. The TG analysis of the dried product from the mixed solution of 30cm3 of the Mo solution and 100cm3 of the HNO3 solution showed the weight loss due to dehydration of 17.5%, which was much lager than that in Fig. 6f. It is likely that the excess NO3 − ions tend to hold excess water molecules in the dried precursor which prevent the crystallization of the β-phase. 3.3 Catalytic behavior of α- and β-MoO3 in partial oxidation of methanol We performed catalytic oxidation reactions of methanol over α- and β-MoO3 prepared from the HNO3-free and -added precursors, respectively, as well as over the commercial α-MoO3 powder (Kishida Chemical Co.) for comparison. The filled symbols in Fig. 7 represent the methanol conversions as a function of reaction temperature. The catalytic activity of the prepared α-type sample was relatively low at every reaction temperature and was equivalent to that of the commercial one. In contrast, β-MoO3 exhibited a significantly higher catalytic activity even at 523K, as was reported by Machiels et al. [10] Since the BET surface area of β-MoO3 was only 1.2–1.4 times larger than that of α-MoO3 as is shown in Table 1 , the big difference between the catalytic activities of the two was largely attributable to the differences between their surface chemical properties. The conversion over β-MoO3 decreased above 573K but was maintained at a high level. At reaction temperatures of 673 and 723K, although the phase transition into the α-form was confirmed by XRD, the catalytic activity was much higher than those of the prepared and commercial α-MoO3. This is worthy of attention but the reason has never become clear. The formaldehyde yields were also shown by the open symbols in Fig. 7. They were much lower than the methanol conversions despite no detection of other gaseous and volatile products such as CO, CO2, or dimethyl ether. During the reactions, we observed white solid deposits around the outlet of the reactor, which were identified to be 1,3,5-trioxane, a trimeric product of formaldehyde, by XRD and IR spectroscopy; therefore formaldehyde was the chief product of the catalytic oxidation of methanol over α- and β-MoO3 in a large excess of air. The mechanism of catalytic methanol oxidation to formaldehyde was investigated on the MoO3-based catalysts [4,7,8,11,20,21]. The first reaction step is the formation of methoxy groups by dissociative adsorption of methanol, which is considered to take place on terminal oxygen (MoO) vacancy sites on the catalyst surface which behave as Lewis acid centers [4,11,20]. This suggests that the high catalytic activity of β-MoO3 in methanol oxidation may be due to improvements in the acid property. To confirm this, we estimated the type and amount of acid sites on MoO3 through IR spectra of chemisorbed pyridine. The results for α- and β-MoO3 are shown in Fig. 8a–d and e–h, respectively. In spectra a and e, the absorption band characteristic of pyridinium ions adsorbed on Brönsted acid sites was observed at 1537cm−1. Both the samples showed almost the same tendency of the peak intensity to decrease with increasing evacuation temperature, indicating that α- and β-MoO3 had nearly equivalent Brönsted acid sites. On the other hand, the peak intensity of the absorption bands at 1445cm−1 in Fig. 8e–h was higher than that at 1447cm−1 in Fig. 8a–d at every evacuation temperature. These absorption bands are due to pyridine molecules coordinatively-bonded to Lewis acid sites, and hence β-MoO3 has the larger number of Lewis acid sites with higher acidity than α-MoO3. The quantitative difference of Lewis acid sites between the two can be predicted by a model which assumes that the surface stoichiometry is represented by an ideal termination of the bulk [11]. α-MoO3 has a layered structure in which the layers composed of corner- and edge-shared MoO6 octahedra are stacked along the b axis. If cleavage for segmentation of the bulk into small crystallites takes place between the adjacent layers, that is, along the (010) lattice plane, none of the bonds in the MoO6 octahedra is broken. However, cleavage in other directions requires breaking of the bonds between the Mo atoms at the centers and the shared oxygen atoms at the corners of the MoO6 octahedra, resulting in creation of oxygen vacancies on the exposed surface. In practice, due to the weak interlayer interaction, the coordinatively-saturated (010) faces tend to make up a large percentage of exposed faces [5,6]; therefore the fraction of exposed Mo atoms as Lewis acid centers on the surface is expected to be relatively small. On the other hand, β-MoO3 forms a monoclinic ReO3-structure in which every MoO6 octahedron shares all of its corners with adjacent MoO6 octahedra [9,14]. Accordingly, cleavage in any direction is accompanied with breaking of the Mo–O bonds to produce a large quantity of coordinatively-unsaturated Mo atoms on the surface which would behave as active centers for methanol oxidation. Indeed, it was estimated from Fig. 8a and e that β-MoO3 had approximately two times the number of Lewis acid sites per unit weight of α-MoO3, but the relative catalytic activity of β-MoO3 was far higher than the value: for example, the methanol conversion at 523K over β-MoO3 was 19 times higher than that over α-MoO3. This suggests that the higher acidity as well as the larger number of the Lewis acid sites on the surface of β-MoO3 probably led to the higher catalytic activity in partial oxidation of methanol. 4 Conclusions We developed a very simple and rapid synthetic procedure of β-MoO3 through evaporation of the HNO3-added molybdic acid solution. The pure product was obtained only when the molar ratio of HNO3/Mo in the solution was approximately 1–2, whereas α-MoO3 was undesirably produced outside that HNO3/Mo ratio range. Na+ ions must be exhaustively removed from the precursory Mo solution because they seriously disturbed the formation of the β-phase. The HNO3 addition brought about no structural change of isopolymolybdate ions as well as no creation of new Mo compounds in the solution, but affected the dehydration of the dried precursor to induce the crystallization of the β-phase. Compared to the α-form, β-MoO3 had the larger number of Lewis acid sites with higher acidity on the surface, and thereby exhibited much higher catalytic activity in partial oxidation of methanol. The catalytic behavior of β-MoO3 in other reactions merit further research.
