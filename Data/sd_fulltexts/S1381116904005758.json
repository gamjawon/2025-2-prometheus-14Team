The results indicated that the conversion increases with reaction temperature and hydrogen pressure. And increasing the hydrogen pressure results in more hydrogenation, but increasing reaction temperature can improve the two parallel pathways of direct desulfurization and hydrogenation desulfurization at same degree. Sulfur can replace the surface oxygen of passivated nitride in the HDS reaction although the bulk structure is preserved. Graphical abstract The reaction network for HDS of dibenzothiophene over β-Mo2N0.78/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. Keywords Dibenzothiophene Alumina β-Mo2N0.78 Hydrodesulfurization 1 Introduction An increasing interest has developed in exploring the catalytic properties of molybdenum nitrides because they resemble group VIII metals in a number of hydrogen involved reactions, which include CO hydrogenation [1], NH3 synthesis [2] and hydrotreating (HDN, HDS) [3–5] reactions, etc. Studies have shown that the alumina-supported γ-Mo2N is more active than molybdenum sulfided catalysts for the HDSs of thiophene, benzothiophene and dibenzothiophene [5–8]. Nagai et al. [5] found that γ-Mo2N has extremely selective activity for the CS bond breakage of dibenzothiophene to form biphenyl. Both Abe and Bell [8], and Markel and Van Zee [9] found unsupported γ-Mo2N is active for HDS of benzothiophene or thiophene, and the study also showed that the bulk structure of the γ-Mo2N is preserved despite the sulfiding conditions present in the catalytic reactor. Recently some research found that γ-Mo2N will be transformed to β-Mo2N0.78 when it is heated in He [10], and Nagai et al. [11] once synthesized pure β-Mo2N0.78 when they replaced NH3 with He to cool down the product of temperature-programmed reaction of MoO3 and NH3. We synthesized the pure β-Mo2N0.78 via the temperature-programmed reaction of MoO3 and N2–H2 mixture gases, and found that it is more active than molybdenum sulfide in thiophene's HDS reaction [12]. In this paper, the γ-alumina-supported β-Mo2N0.78 catalyst was prepared with N2–H2 mixture gases, and its HDS activity and selectivity of dibenzothiophene is first reported. 2 Experiment Alumina-supported molybdenum oxide precursors with various Mo loadings were prepared by impregnation of γ-Al2O3 with aqueous solutions of ammonium heptamolybdate. Catalysts with loading above 10wt.% required multiple impregnations. Following impregnation, catalysts were dried 3h at 393K and then calcined 5h in air at 773K. Alumina-supported nitrides were produced according to the reference [12]. The precursor of catalyst was packed on the center of a quartz tube reactor, and was treated with N2–H2 from room temperature to 573K at a heating rate of 10Kmin−1, from 573 to 773K at 0.6Kmin−1, then from 773 to 973K at 2Kmin−1 and hold at this temperature for 2h. After the nitriding reaction, the reactor was cooled down to room temperature under N2, and then passivated with a mixture of 1% O2 in N2 for 2h. Bulk crystal structures of catalyst were determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD). Specific surface area of catalyst was evaluated by applying the BET method to the nitrogen adsorption isotherms measured at 77K. The MoK-edge EXAFS spectra were collected at the beamline of 1W1B, the XAFS station of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF). The electron storage ring was operated at 2.2GeV with a typical current of 80mA. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were carried out in 10% H2 in Ar (by volume) with a flow rate of 30ml/min and a temperature ramping rate of 10K/min. TPR profiles were recorded with a thermal conductivity detector. The TPR experiment of molybdenum sulfide was performed in situ after sulfuration of molybdenum trioxide. The sulfuration was carried out using a 3% CS2/cyclohexane mixture at 623K for 2h and the H2 flow rate of 20ml/min. The activity measurement for dibenzothiophene HDS was carried out in the high pressure autoclave for 1h. The reaction material is 0.5wt.% dibenzothiophene in cyclohexane and the liquid products of HDS was analyzed by gas chromatogram. 3 Results and discussion XRD patterns of molybdenum precursor before and after nitridation are shown in Fig. 1 . The appearance of MoO3 diffraction peaks besides that of γ-Al2O3 indicates that the precursor is MoO3/γ-Al2O3. After nitridation with N2–H2 mixture gases, the diffraction peaks of MoO3 disappear and a number of β-Mo2N0.78 diffraction peaks are observed. These results indicate that MoO3 is transformed to β-Mo2N0.78 by nitridation and β-Mo2N0.78/γ-Al2O3 is synthesized via temperature-programmed reaction. For samples with Mo loading below ∼10wt.%, only diffraction of γ-Al2O3 supporter is observed in XRD patterns. At high loadings (≥20wt.%), a number of diffraction peaks of β-Mo2N0.78 phase are observed. It indicates that molybdenum nitride formed and highly dispersed on the surface of alumina supporter when the loading amount of Mo is low. The specific surface area of catalyst with different Mo loading is shown in Table 1 . The surface area slowly decreases with increase of Mo loading when it is low (≤10wt.%) or high (≥20wt.%), but decreases greatly when Mo loading increases from 10 to 20wt.%, which indicates that alumina support is fully covered by Mo species in the Mo loading of 10–20wt.%. Thus, we attempted to apply XANES spectroscopy to elucidate structural details. MoK-edge XANES spectra and Fourier transform of the EXAFS oscillations for several compounds and catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 . Before nitriding reaction, the spectral of MoO3/γ-Al2O3 is almost similar to ammonium heptamolbdate, which is distorted octahedral. It suggests that dominant Mo species on alumina support are also in poor order. After nitriding, structural change can be clearly seen in XANES, and the spectral of supported nitride is similar to unsupported nitride. There is only one large peak at about 0.136nm for standard compound Na2MoO4·2H2O on its radial structure functions (RSFs), which represents the four nearest oxygen neighbors. The MoO distances are 0.176nm according to the literature [13], so the position of the peak of RSF is downshifted from the true distance by about 0.04nm. Three major peaks on the RSF of MoO3/γ-Al2O3 crystalline are observed, the first two represent six nearest neighbor oxygen atoms around the Mo atom and the third large peak is due to the next nearest neighbors, which are consistent with previous reports [14]. There are three major peaks on the RSF of unsupported β-Mo2N0.78 at about 0.161, 0.258 and 0.380nm, respectively. For alumina-supported oxide after nitridation, three peaks are located almost at the same positions as those of β-Mo2N0.78 crystalline, which indicates that Mo oxide transforms to β-Mo2N0.78 through nitriding reaction. And the magnitude of the third peak greatly decreases on the RSF of supported nitride compared with that of unsupported. This result suggests that the Mo species are well dispersed on the surface of support. The main products for HDS of dibenzothiophene on β-Mo2N0.78/γ-Al2O3 catalyst are biphenyl (BP) and cyclohexylbenzene (CHB), and minority hexahydrodibenzothiophene and tetrahydrodibenzothiophene are also created. So the HDS reaction goes through two parallel pathways: (i) direct desulfurization to yield BP, and (ii) hydrogenation followed by desulfurization to yield CHB, which like previous results about HDS of dibenzothiophene on γ-Mo2N [5]. In addition, our experiment result showed that 26% BP can be converted to CHB when 0.5wt.% BP in cyclohexane at 593K and 12MPa hydrogen pressure with 10% Mo loading catalyst, which indicates that BP can further convert to CHB by hydrogenation. Nagai et al. [5] once reported that BP is not hydrogenated to form CHB on alumina-supported γ-Mo2N catalyst, which indicates that β-Mo2N0.78 has stronger hydrogenation capacity than γ-Mo2N. The results of DBT HDS at different temperature are shown in Table 2 . It shows that the DBT conversion increases with increasing of temperature, and the BP selectivity almost unchanged at these temperatures, which indicates that the reaction temperature increasing can improve the two parallel pathways at same degree. The effect of hydrogen pressure on the conversion of DBT at 593K is shown in Table 3 . The conversion of DBT increases with increasing of hydrogen pressure, and the selectivity of BP decreases with the pressure increasing. It indicates that high hydrogen pressure is favorable for the hydrogenation of DBT. The decrease of BP selectivity is also because that some BP can be further hydrogenated to form CHB at high hydrogen pressure. We reported that the bulk structure of β-Mo2N0.78 catalyst was kept after thiophene HDS reaction at 633K for 9h in our previous work [12]. The MoK-edge XANES spectra and RSF of supported nitride after HDS of dibenzothiophene at 563K is shown in Fig. 3 . It can be seen that after HDS reaction, XANES spectra and RSF have slightly change, which indicates that the structure of catalyst is preserved after HDS reaction. Several groups [15–16] reported the result of surface sulfidation of γ-Mo2N catalysts. In this study, H2-TPR experiment is also used to deeply indicate the change of catalyst properties after HDS. The TPR profiles of unsupported and supported passivated catalyst are shown in Fig. 4 . Compared with free passivated β-Mo2N0.78, passivated β-Mo2N0.78 shows two hydrogen consumption peaks, which indicates that the peak at about 700K is caused by reduction of surface oxide species created during passivate reaction. The same phenomenon was also observed in TPR character of γ-Mo2N [17]. The TPR profile of β-Mo2N0.78/γ-Al2O3 shows two hydrogen consumption peaks and they are similar to those of unsupported β-Mo2N0.78 basis on the temperature position. After HDS reaction, it can be seen that the 700K reduction peak of supported β-Mo2N0.78 catalyst becomes very weak and a new reduction peak at about 540K is observed correspondingly. Compared with the TPR profile of molybdenum sulfide, the new peak formation can be attributed to the sulfuration of molybdenum nitride in the condition of HDS. There is a high temperature reduction peak above 1000K for molybdenum sulfide, but it is not observed for the nitride catalyst after HDS. These results indicate that β-Mo2N0.78/γ-Al2O3 catalyst surface is slightly sulfided, which results from sulfur replaces the surface oxygen of passivated nitride in the HDS condition although the bulk structure is preserved.

        "dc:description": "γ-Alumina-supported β-Mo2N0.78 catalyst was synthesized by the temperature-programmed nitriding reaction and tested to determine its catalytic activity and selectivity during the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) of dibenzothiophene. The results indicated that the conversion increases with reaction temperature and hydrogen pressure. And increasing the hydrogen pressure results in more hydrogenation, but increasing reaction temperature can improve the two parallel pathways of direct desulfurization and hydrogenation desulfurization at same degree. Sulfur can replace the surface oxygen of passivated nitride in the HDS reaction although the bulk structure is preserved.",
