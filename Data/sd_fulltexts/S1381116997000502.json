Singh * , A.K. Pandey Catalysis Division, National Chemical Laboratory, Pune 41 1008, India Received 18 October 1996; accepted 19 February 1997 Abstract The vapour phase acetylation of benzene has been investigated over various zeolite catalysts using acetic acid as acetylating agent in a tubular reactor and at atmospheric pressure. The rate of acetic acid conversion (TOF = m mol s- 1 mot-' AI X 10-3) is found to be about eleven times higher over H-ZSM-5 (TOF=46.2) compared to the H-mordenite (TOF = 4.3). HY and REY do not catalyze the reaction. The acidity of the catalysts is evaluated by the temperature programmed desorption of ammonia. NH 3 TPD results show that the presence of strong Brsted acid sites are desired for the acetylation of benzene by acetic acid. The effects of time on stream (TOS), degree of Na-exchange, S'OZ/A1203 molar ratios, reaction temperature, weight hourly space velocity (WHSV h- 1 ) and molar ratios of benzene/CH 3COOH upon the conversion of acetic acid and product yields are investigated in the acetylation of benzene using H-ZSM-5 zeolite. H-ZSM-5 is partially deactivated under these reaction conditions. Acetic acid conversion increased with reaction temperature and benzene/CH,COOH molar ratios, whereas it decreased with the increase in reaction time, degree of Na-exchange, WHSV (h-1) and Si02/A1203 molar ratio. Presumably, the acetylation proceeds by the attack of an electrophile (CH,C0+) on the benzene ring resulting in the formation of acetophenone. 1997 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction Acetophenone can react with formaldehyde to yield light resistant resins which are used as additives in nitrocellulose paints [1]. It is also used as a photoinitiator and in the pharmaceuticals, perfumery and pesticide industries [2]. It can be hydrogenated to 1-phenylethanol which is used for the production of aromatic ester fragrances [3]. Industrially, acetophenone is produced in the Hock process by decomposition of hydroperoxide. A more selective synthesis of x Corresponding author.

P/1 S1381-1169(97)00050-2 acetophenone by cleavage of cumene hydroperoxide over a cupric catalyst, has been patented [4]. Acetophenone can also be produced by oxidizing the methyl phenyl carbinol intermediate which is found in styrene production processes [5,6]. Conventionally, it was prepared by the Friedel-Crafts reaction of acetyl chloride with benzene in the presence of homogeneous catalyst, AIC13. However, the homogeneous catalysts have several disadvantages if applied to industrial processes such as wasting large amounts of catalysts, corrosion of reactors, water pollution by acidic waste water and difficulty of catalyst recovery [7]. In order to overcome the difficulties of the homogeneous sys- 142 A.P. Singly AX Pandey/Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 123 (1997) 141-147 tems, the development and utilization of a solid zeolite catalyst is important. Zeolites are attractive as catalysts for the acetylation reactions due to their acidity, shape selectivity and regenerability properties [8-17]. The objective of the present work is to develop a zeolite catalyst for the acetylation of benzene to acetophenone and to replace acetyl chloride (used in the conventional methods) by acetic acid. Acetyl chloride produces HCl during the reaction, which is environmentally hazardous. The catalyst and process parameters are optimised to enhance the conversion of acetic acid and selectivity to acetophenone. The reaction using zeolite as a catalyst and acetic acid as an acetylating agent has not been reported before. 2. Experimental ZSM-5 zeolites were synthesized using the literature procedure [18]. The Si02/A1203 ratio in the final product was varied by adjusting the amount of Al source added in the synthesis mixture. As synthesized ZSM-5 samples were calcined in air at 773 K for 16 h to remove the occluded structure-directing agent. The calcined samples were then refluxed thrice with a 1 M NH4N03 solution for 8 h at 353 K followed by calcination at 773 K for 16 h in order to ensure that the samples were in their complete protonic forms. Modified forms of H-ZSM-5 such as H-Na(28.9)ZSM-5, H-Na(34.1)ZSM-5 and HNa(37.3)ZSM-5 were prepared by an exchange with 0.3, 0.5 and 1.0 M solutions of NaN031 respectively, for 24 h at room temperature. Zeolites H-mordenite and Na-Y were obtained from Laporte Inorganics, Cheshire, UK. RE-Y was prepared from Na-Y by exchange with 1 M NH4NO3 (three exchanges, 353 K, 8 h) and thus the resulting NH4-Y was treated with 5% rare earth chloride solution by following the analogous method employed for NH 4-Y exchange. The X-ray powder diffraction patterns of all samples were recorded on a Rigaku (D- Max/III-VCmodel, Cu K oc radiation) X-ray diffractometer. Chemical analysis was performed by a combination of wet chemical and atomic absorption spectroscopy (Hitachi 800). The nitrogen BET surface areas were measured using an Omnisorb 100 CX apparatus. Scanning electron microscope (Shimadzu, Model UV2101 PC) was used to determine the average crystal size of the zeolites. Typical characteristic data of the zeolites are listed in Table 1. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of ammonia was recorded on a fixed bed flow type apparatus attached to a HCl solution trap [9,19]. Approximately 1.0 g of sample was activated in flowing N2 at 773 K for 4 h, then ammonia was passed over the sample at 303 K for 30 min. The sample was subsequently kept in the flow of N2 (50 ml min -1) at 303 K for 15 h in order to eliminate the physisorbed ammonia. Acid-strength distribution and NH 3 chemisorbed at 303 K were obtained by raising the temperature, with a ramping rate of 10 min-1, from 303 to 773 K in a number of steps in a flow of nitrogen (10 ml min-1), Table 1. The NH 3 evolved was trapped in a HCl solution and titrated with a standard NaOH solution. The gas-phase acetylation of benzene with acetic acid was carried out in a fixed bed type reactor with a continuous flow system at atmospheric pressure. The zeolite catalyst (2.0 g, mesh size 15-30 mesh range) was packed in a glass reactor (1.4 cm I.D) and placed in a vertical furnance. Pretreatment of the catalyst consisted of heating in a stream of nitrogen (50 cm 3 min-') for 2 h. Then a predetermined mixture of benzene and acetic acid was passed through the catalytic bed by a syringe pump. The product mixture was condensed at the reactor outlet and the samples were analyzed periodically by a gas-chromatograph (Blue Star Model 421) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a capillary column (5 /.t,m thick crosslinked methyl silicone gum, 0.2 mm X 50 m long). The products were also identified by injecting an authentic sample and GC/MS (Shimadzu, QP 2000A) analysis.

Catalyst characterization Table 1 lists the Si02/A1203 ratios, H+-exchange (%), crystal size and surface areas of H-ZSM-5 and H-mordenite zeolites used in this work. These data reveal that zeolite samples are highly crystalline and in the protonic forms. No reflections of a dense phase or any other zeolite phase are found. Table 1 also illustrates the amount of NH 3 desorbed from zeolites in different temperature steps. 3.2. Catalytic activity The results of the catalytic activities in the acetylation of benzene with acetic acid using H-ZSM-5 and H-mordenite catalysts are shown in Table 1. The main product of the reaction is acetophenone. Small amounts of diacetylbenzenes (others) are also detected in the reaction. The activities of H-ZSM-5 and H-mordenite are compared using data after the initial 2 h of the run under similar reaction conditions. H-ZSM-5 exhibits the higher catalytic activity and the rate of acetic acid conversion (TOF) is found to be several times higher over H-ZSM-5 than that of the H-mordenite. Zeolites H-Y and RE-Y are ineffective for the acetylation of benzene to acetophenone at our reaction conditions. The conversion of acetic acid over H-ZSM-5 and H-mordenite are found to be 42.6 and 7.2 wt%, respectively. The corresponding TOF are 46.2 and 4.3, respectively. In addition, the results show that the selectivity for acetophenone over H-ZSM-5 is greater (91.1 wt. %) than that of H-mordenite (31.4 wt%). From the data in Table 1, it is clear that the performance of the catalyst is governed by the acidity and structure of the zeolites. The higher conversion of acetic acid over H-ZSM-5 seems to be due the fact that the H-ZSM-5 exhibits the three dimensional channel systems and stronger Brsted acid sites compared to the H-mordenite (Table 1). These results indicate that acid strength is the most important factor for the polarization of CH3COOH into an electrophile (CH3C0+) which attacks the benzene ring and produces the acetophenone [9,12,14,20]. The higher selectivity for acetophenone over H-ZSM-5 might be attributed to its smaller pore openings (0.51 X 0.55 nm and 0.54 X 0.56 nm) than H-mordenite (0.65 X 0.7 nm) which prevent the secondary reactions in the zeolite channels and consequently the formation of diacetyl benzene. 3.3.

Pandey/Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 123 (1997) 141-147 zenes (others) over H-ZSM-5 are presented as a function of time on stream in Fig. 1. No substantial change in the conversion of acetic acid is observed after 2 h time on stream study, however, slight deactivation of the catalyst is noticed in the beginning of the reaction. A marginal increase in the selectivity for acetophenone is noticed with the reaction time. The increase in selectivity for acetophenone with time on stream may be attributed to the deactivation of the outer surface of H-ZSM-5 which inhibits the formation of unwanted products. 3.4. Effect of Na-exchange The conversion of acetic acid to the products in the acetylation of benzene was measured over a series of Na+-exchange H-ZSM-5 zeolites at a constant temperature (523 K) with benzene/acetic acid molar ratio of two. The data presented in Table 2 show that the rate of acetic acid conversion decreases in the following order: H-ZSM-5 > H-Na(28.9)-ZSM-5 > HNa(34.1)-ZSM-5 > H-Na(37.3)-ZSM-5. HZSM-5 zeolite is much more active than Na+exchanged zeolite [ 12] but is less selective for acetophenone formation. In addition, there is more diacetyl benzenes produced over H-ZSM-5 than over Na+-exchanged H-ZSM-5. These data suggest that the stronger Brsted acid sites of H-ZSM-5 are capable of facilitating reaction between acetophenone and acetic acid (to a little extent) to the formation of diacetyl benzenes. Thus removal of little amount of stronger Brsted acid sites by Na+-ion exchange in Table 2 Effect of Na-exchange 145 Table 3 Effect of Si02 /A1203 molar ratio of H-ZSM-5 S'Oz /Al ,03 molar ratio 41 80 102 160 Conversion of acetic acid (wt%) 42.6 38.8 15.4 14.1 Product distribution (wt%) Acetophenone (ACP) Others a Reaction conditions: see footnotes to Table I. H-ZSM-5 results in slightly lower activity but improves selectivity up to 100 wt% for acetophenone (Table 1). 3.5. Effect of Si0z/A1203 ratio Table 3 depicts a comparison of the performance of H-ZSM-5 zeolite having Si02/A1203 molar ratios of 41, 80, 102 and 160 in the acetylation of benzene at 523 K. Acetic acid conversion decreased with the increase in Si0z/A1203 molar ratio without a significant change in the product distribution. 3.6. Effect of reaction temperature The temperature of the reaction has a determining influence on the rate of acetic acid conversion and product distribution (Fig. 2). The initial rate of CH 3COOH conversion (TOF) over H-ZSM-5 increases linearly with the increase in reaction temperature but selectivity towards acetophenone decreases as shown in Fig. 2. A maximum in acetophenone selectivity (100%) over this catalyst is observed at 503 K 91.1 86.1 91.9 88.4 8.9 13.9 8.1 11.6 Catalyst Conv. of acetic acid (wt%) TOF(M mol s-1 mol- 1 AI X 10-3) b Product distribution ` (wt%) ACP others H-ZSM-5 d 42.6 38.5 91.1 8.9 H-Na(28.9)ZSM-5 a 39.3 35.5 93.7 6.3 H-Na(34.1)ZSM-5 a 31.1 28.1 100.0 - H-Na(37.3)ZSM-5 ` 30.2 27.3 100.0 - a h ` d See Table 1. e Values in parenthesis represent the Na-exchange (%) in H-ZSM-5.

Mechanism The classical Friedel-Crafts acylation is an electrophilic aromatic substitution in which an electron-deficient species (electrophile) is generated by the activation of acetic acid on the protonic sites of the zeolite which attacks the benzene ring resulting in the formation of acetophenone according to the following equations (Eqs. (1)-(3) [9,12,14,20]. O OH II CH3-C-OH + Zeol -H1 ~ CH3-C-OH Ze01 (i) + CH3-C-OHZeoI- ~,. H + ~'~-CH3Zeo1-+HZ0-(21 0 COCH3 O'I-CH3Zeol +Zeot-Ht-(3) 4. Conclusions As a result of this work, it has been demonstrated that H-ZSM-5 showed higher catalytic activity and selectivity than that of H-mordemte for the vapour phase acetylation of benzene by acetic acid. The present study reveals that the excellent activity and selectivity of H-ZSM-5 compared to the H-mordenite are due to both the stronger acid sites and to its narrow pore structure. Increased reaction temperature and molar ratios of benzene/acetic acid lead to increase in acetic acid conversion whereas it decreased with the increase in reaction time, degree of Na+-exchange in H-ZSM-5, Si02/A1203 ratio and WHSV h-'. Further, it is concluded that the presence of stronger 147 Brsted acid sites in zeolite catalysts appears to be very important for the polarization of acetic acid into an electrophile (CH3C0+) which then attacks the benzene ring resulting in the formation of acetophenone.

MOLCAA 97000502 S1381-1169(97)00050-2 10.1016/S1381-1169(97)00050-2 Molecular aspects of heterogeneous catalysis Article Acetylation of benzene to acetophenone over zeolite catalysts A.P. Singh ∗ A.K. Pandey Catalysis Division, National Chemical Laboratory, Pune 41 1008, India ∗ Corresponding author. Fax: +91-212-334761. The vapour phase acetylation of benzene has been investigated over various zeolite catalysts using acetic acid as acetylating agent in a tubular reactor and at atmospheric pressure. The rate of acetic acid conversion (TOF = m mol s−1 mol−1 Al × 10−3) is found to be about eleven times higher over H-ZSM-5 (TOF = 46.2) compared to the H-mordenite (TOF = 4.3). HY and REY do not catalyze the reaction. The acidity of the catalysts is evaluated by the temperature programmed desorption of ammonia. NH3-TPD results show that the presence of strong Brønsted acid sites are desired for the acetylation of benzene by acetic acid. The effects of time on stream (TOS), degree of Na-exchange, SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratios, reaction temperature, weight hourly space velocity (WHSV h−1) and molar ratios of benzene/CH3COOH upon the conversion of acetic acid and product yields are investigated in the acetylation of benzene using H-ZSM-5 zeolite. H-ZSM-5 is partially deactivated under these reaction conditions. Acetic acid conversion increased with reaction temperature and benzene/CH3COOH molar ratios, whereas it decreased with the increase in reaction time, degree of Na-exchange, WHSV (h−1) and SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio. Presumably, the acetylation proceeds by the attack of an electrophile (CH3CO+) on the benzene ring resulting in the formation of acetophenone.
