Graphical abstract Chemical routes for preparing Ziegler-Natta (ZN) catalysts accompany the formation of by-products that remain in final catalysts in different amounts. In the history of ZN catalysts, much less emphasis has been given to analyze such by-products present in catalysts. Herein, we prepared various Mg(OEt)2-based ZN catalysts and conducted solution-state NMR measurements to characterize and quantify the organic components of these catalysts. It was found that, depending on the molecular structure of the internal donor (ID) and catalyst preparation conditions, an ID can undergo side reactions to produce organic by-products. All the catalysts contained different amounts of titanium alkoxy by-products formed in the reaction between Mg(OEt)2 and TiCl4, which were detrimental for the catalyst activity. These by-products were responsible for increasing the amount of the amorphous fraction in polypropylene and decreasing the highly crystalline fraction's stereoregularity. Possible hypotheses to explain the negative impacts of titanium alkoxy by-products are discussed. Keywords Ziegler-Natta catalysts Mg(OEt)2 precursor Solution-state NMR spectroscopy Internal donor Propylene polymerization Titanium alkoxy by-products 1 Introduction Polyolefins have a dominant share in the worldwide production of thermoplastics [1]. The commercial success of polyolefins is driven by the continuous development of various catalysts [2,3]. Among these, heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta (ZN) catalysts have evolved as front-runners, especially for the industrial isotactic polypropylene (PP) production [4–7]. The typical formulation of an industrial ZN pro-catalyst is TiCl4/internal donor/MgCl2, where the internal donor (ID) is an organic Lewis base [4–7]. For polymerization, the pro-catalysts are activated with an alkyl aluminium reagent, often in the presence of another Lewis base called the external donor (ED) [4–7]. In the pro-catalyst, TiCl4 is epitaxially chemisorbed onto coordinatively unsaturated lateral surfaces of MgCl2, together with the ID, and results in the formation of multiple types of active sites [4–7]. The ID coordinates and stabilizes specific lateral surfaces of the MgCl2 support during catalyst preparation [8–10]. In combination with an ED, the ID improves various catalytic properties, such as the productivity, stereospecificity, hydrogen response, and so on [8–10]. Accordingly, the optimum performance of ZN catalysts is dependent on the cooperation among their multiple components. Academic researches on ZN catalysts are mainly devoted to understanding the structure of each component and its catalytic role(s) as well as interactions among different components. These have been pursued by X-ray diffraction/scattering, microscopic, and spectroscopic characterization of support materials, model catalysts, real catalysts, and product polymers [11–20]. A combination of these characterization results with state-of-the-art computational modeling has augmented the fundamental understanding of ZN catalysts and their catalysis [21–25]. In contrast to these efforts, the presence of by-products in ZN catalysts formed during catalyst synthesis and their impacts on the polymerization performance have been negligibly investigated, even though such considerations are not trivial, particularly from an industrial viewpoint. One of the preparation routes for industrial ZN catalysts is based on the solid-state conversion of Mg(OEt)2 to MgCl2 by reaction with TiCl4 in the presence of an ID [14,26]. During this process, titanium ethoxy compounds of the form of TiCl4– x (OEt) x are produced, which may remain in catalysts as surface adsorbed impurities [27]. Nearly three decades before, Lee and co-workers prepared a series of MgCl2/benzoyl chloride/TiCl4 catalysts from Mg(OEt)2 and evaluated the ethoxy content of these catalysts [28]. They found that the ethoxy content had a negative correlation with the catalyst activity and stereoregularity of formed PP, and it decreased with an increase in the number of TiCl4 treatment in catalyst preparation. The ethoxy content became insignificant after three repeated cycles of the TiCl4 treatment, while such a rigorous process may not be suitable in terms of the catalyst preparation cost. A few similar studies also reported the negative impacts of ethoxy compounds on the polymerization performance of Mg(OEt)2-based ZN catalysts [29–31]. In all these earlier studies, the ethoxy content was evaluated by measuring the ethanol amount of a catalyst dissolved in a protic solvent or solution (e.g. acidic water) using gas chromatography (GC). As a result, GC analysis could not confirm the true chemical identity of ethoxy compounds. Apart from these, ZN catalysts preparation requires an elevated temperature, at which the ID can undergo side reactions to produce organic by-products, as evident earlier by GC and IR spectroscopic analyses of catalyst samples [32–34]. Since the seminal paper of Lee and co-workers [28], negligible progress has been made in understanding the by-products of ZN catalysts and their impacts on the polymerization performance. Herein, we wish to revisit these issues by solution-state NMR measurements of ZN catalysts in a polar aprotic solvent, namely, deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d 6). The polarity of DMSO-d 6 was exploited to effectively dissolve the MgCl2-supported ZN catalysts. At the same time, the aprotic nature and the absence of acid were advantageous in retaining the molecular structure of the ethoxy and other organic compounds of the catalysts. Gupta and co-workers employed solution-state 1H NMR in deuterated methanol to accurately determine the ID content of a ZN catalyst [35]. In a subsequent publication, they quantitatively characterized different organic compounds present in a fourth-generation ZN catalyst by employing 1H, 13C, and 2D NMR spectroscopy in solution [36]. Even though these previous studies demonstrated the potential of solution-state NMR, applying the technique for systematic investigations of by-product formation in different generations of ZN catalysts has not been done. In this study, we thus set our aim to apply 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy of 1H and 13C nuclei in polar aprotic DMSO-d 6 to characterize and quantify the organic components of three widely used and industrially relevant generations of ZN catalysts. Also, polymerization experiments were conducted to understand the impacts of by-products on the catalytic performance. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials All commercially available reagents were of research grades and used as received unless specified. Titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), ethyl benzoate (EB), di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), and 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. DBP and EB were dried over molecular sieves 4A with N2 bubbling. 2-Isopentyl-2-isopropyl-1,3-dimethoxypropane (DE) was synthesized and used as a 1,3-diether compound after purifying by distillation under reduced pressure. n-Heptane and toluene were purchased from Kanto Chemical Co., Inc. They were dried over molecular sieves 4A with N2 bubbling and stored under N2. Cyclohexylmethyldimethoxysilane (CMDMS) was purified by distillation under reduced pressure. DMSO-d 6 was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. Propylene of a polymerization grade was donated by Japan Polypropylene Corporation and used as delivered. Triethyl aluminium (TEA) as an activator for propylene polymerization was donated by Tosoh Finechem Co. and used after diluting with n-heptane. 2.2 Catalyst preparation Three kinds of ZN catalysts were prepared, which differed in the internal donor (ID) employed during catalyst preparation. Note that each kind was prepared in duplicate pairs (Table 1 ) to cautiously avoid any misleading conclusions that could be obtained owing to the small amount of the by-products. The catalysts are represented in the form of CatID-x, where x corresponds to the serial number for the catalysts prepared using the identical ID. The catalysts were prepared from spherical Mg(OEt)2 particles based on our previous papers [14,37]. A three-neck flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a condenser was charged with 20 g of Mg(OEt)2 powder and 136 mL of toluene under an N2 atmosphere. To this, 40 mL of TiCl4 was added dropwise by maintaining the temperature at 4–5 °C with continuous stirring for 20 min. Thereafter, the temperature was slowly raised to 60 °C to add 42.0 mmol of EB or 23.4 mmol either of DBP or DE. Important to note that EB is a monofunctional ligand, and therefore its amount was almost doubled compared with the other bifunctional IDs. The temperature was further raised to 90 °C in the case of EB and to 110 °C in the cases of DBP and DE. A lower reaction temperature for EB compared with DBP and DE was chosen due to its smaller adsorption energies on catalytically relevant surfaces of the MgCl2 support [23]. After 2 h reaction, the supernatant was removed, and the solid was repeatedly washed with toluene at 100 °C. The obtained product was treated with additional 40 mL of TiCl4 and 136 mL of toluene for 2 h at 90 or 110 °C. After this, the product was washed with n-heptane at 40 °C and vacuum dried to obtain the catalysts (Table 1) in the solid form. Another duplicate pair of DBP-containing catalysts (CatDBP-3,4, Table 1) was prepared with one TiCl4 treatment to understand the effect of TiCl4 treatment on the formation of by-products. They were obtained in the solid form after additional washing of the product of the first TiCl4 treatment (as explained above) with n-heptane at 40 °C followed by vacuum drying. 2.3 Catalyst characterization All NMR spectra such as 1H, 13C{1H}, 1H–1H COSY, 13C DEPT, and 1H–13C HMQC of the catalysts were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE III 400 MHz spectrometer using standard pulse program in DMSO-d 6 at 25 °C. Chemical shifts were acquired in ppm, referenced to the peak of residual DMSO at 2.50 ppm, and the peak of DMSO-d 6 at 39.52 ppm in the 1H and 13C{1H} NMR, respectively. For NMR measurements, a specified amount of a catalyst and an aliquot of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane were dissolved in DMSO-d 6 and transferred to an NMR tube under an N2 atmosphere. The peak integral of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane at 7.00 ppm in 1H NMR was used as an internal standard for quantifying the organic components of a catalyst. The titanium content of the catalysts was determined by a colorimetric titration method. A specified amount of a catalyst was dissolved in a HCl/H2SO4/H2O2 solution, and the absorption intensity of a charge-transfer complex of titanium at 410 nm was recorded on a UV–vis spectrometer (V-670 JASCO) to calculate the titanium content using an external calibration curve. 2.4 Propylene polymerization Propylene polymerization was performed in a 1 L stainless steel reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer rotating at 350 rpm. Typically, n-heptane (400 mL), TEA (2.0 mmol), CMDMS (0.2 mmol), a catalyst (Ti =5.0 μmol), and H2 (0.025 MPa) were introduced to the reactor in this order under N2 at room temperature. Immediately afterward, propylene (0.6 MPa) was introduced, and the temperature was brought to 70 °C (took a few min). Polymerization was performed for 30 min with a constant supply of propylene. Finally, the reaction mixture was dried over N2 flow, followed by vacuum drying at 60 °C for 8 h. 2.5 Polymer characterization The average molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of polypropylene (PP) samples were acquired against polystyrene standards on a high-temperature gel-permeation chromatography (GPC150C, Waters) system equipped with polystyrene gel columns (AT-806MS, Shodex) and an IR detector (IR-4, Polymer Char) at 140 °C, using o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) as an eluent. Temperature-rising elution fractionation (TREF, Japan Polychem) equipped with an IR detector was employed to determine the amount of the ODCB-soluble amorphous fraction (OS), ODCB-insoluble crystalline fraction (OI), and the peak elution temperature (T p) of the crystalline fraction of PP samples. 20 mg of a PP sample was dissolved in 4.0 mL of ODCB containing 0.04 wt% of 2,6,-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol as an antioxidant at 140 °C. The solution was transferred to a TREF column, and gradually cooled down from 140 °C to room temperature. The elution of the loaded PP with ODCB was first carried out at 40 °C for 10 min to obtain the OS fraction, and then the column was gradually heated up to 140 °C to elute the OI fraction and determine its T p. 3 Results and discussion The list of prepared catalysts is shown in Table 1. Here, the chemical compositions of three successive generations of ZN catalysts prepared from the Mg(OEt)2 precursor are comprehensively compared. The internal donor (ID) and Ti contents were within typical ranges for industrial ZN catalysts [7,37]. The Ti content was sensitive to the number of TiCl4 treatment during catalyst preparation and the type of the employed ID, as they can influence the size and morphology of primary crystallites as well as the extent of competitive adsorption on MgCl2 surfaces [8,29]. For the DBP- and DE-based catalysts, the Ti/ID mole ratio was on an average close to 1, and higher than that of the EB-based catalysts, plausibly due to the molecular bulkiness of DBP and DE. Fig. 1 shows the 1H NMR spectra of representative catalysts with peak assignments for various organic components. The assignments were performed by referring to the 1H NMR spectrum of the individual IDs (Fig. S1) and confirmed by performing 13C{1H}, 13C DEPT, and 2D NMR measurements (Figs. S2–4). In the case of EB- and DE-based catalysts, the peaks were straightforwardly assigned to the original ID, residual n-heptane, and ethoxy (OEt) group. The 1H NMR spectra of the DBP-based catalysts, on the other hand, are complicated due to the occurrence of side reactions of DBP. In particular, transesterification reactions with TiCl4– x (OEt) x compounds and the reaction with TiCl4 resulted in the exchange of butoxy groups with the ethoxy and chloride groups, as evidenced from Figs. 1 and S3. The number of TiCl4 treatment likely affected the extent of side reactions, which will be discussed in a subsequent section. It is known that the occurrence of side reactions of an aromatic ester sensitively depends on the temperature employed for the activation of a catalyst [32,33]. An increase in temperature with respect to the optimum activation temperature accelerates transesterification reactions as well as the reaction with TiCl4. Thus, a lower optimum activation temperature of 90 °C for the EB-based catalysts than 110 °C for the DBP-based catalysts would reasonably explain the absence of an EB-derived carbonyl chloride species in these catalysts (Figs. 1 and S2). On the contrary, the low reactivity of 1,3-diether compounds with TiCl4, in general [38], would account for the absence of DE-derived by-products in the DE-based catalysts (Figs. 1 and S4). In Fig. 1, the ethoxy group was identified in all catalysts, which was most likely associated with residual titanium ethoxy compounds formed upon reaction of Mg(OEt)2 with TiCl4. Since earlier studies could not assure the chemical identity of these ethoxy compounds, an attempt was made to analyze them in more detail by NMR spectroscopy. Fig. 2 shows the 1H NMR methylene region of the ethoxy group of selected catalysts, which remained isolated in all spectra (see Fig. 1). In this methylene region, a quartet peak, centred at 3.37–3.39 ppm, primarily appeared. Note that the methylene peaks of the Mg(OEt)2 precursor and EtOH as a residual in the synthesis of Mg(OEt)2 also appear at an almost identical position (Fig. S5). However, the ethoxy peaks of the catalysts were not from residual EtOH or Mg(OEt)2 due to the following reasons: 1) The triplet peak of the −OH group of ethanol at 4.35 ppm was barely detected in the 1H NMR spectrum of all catalysts (see Fig. 1) and 2) the reaction between Mg(OEt)2 and TiCl4 is highly exothermic; hence any residual Mg(OEt)2, which is hardly accessible by TiCl4 in solid catalysts, would be immediately converted into TiCl4– x (OEt) x as soon as a catalyst is dissolved in the NMR solvent. A comparative study of the products formed in a model reaction between TiCl4 and EtOH at the 10:1 mole ratio, with EtOH and Ti(OEt)4, by NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S6), suggested that the primary quartet of the ethoxy group of the catalysts was due to TiCl3(OEt). To the downfield of this primary quartet, another plausible quartet of weaker intensity appeared in CatDBP-1,2, which could be ascribed to a TiCl3(OEt)/ID adduct as proposed earlier [30]. The use of toluene instead of n-heptane as the washing solvent (see Experimental Section) likely dissolved [30,39], and thus effectively removed the TiCl3(OEt)/ID adduct formed in the first TiCl4 treatment during catalyst preparation. This consideration would explain the absence of the said adduct in CatDBP-3,4. This secondary quartet more or less existed in CatEB-1,2 and CatDE-1,2 with further weaker intensities. Additionally, to the upfield of the primary quartet, a sharp triplet of weaker intensity appeared in CatDBP-1,2, which became further weaker in CatDBP-3,4. This triplet was correlated to the peak at 1.35 ppm in the 1H–1H COSY NMR (Fig. S3b); hence it could be ascribed to TiCl3(OnBu) formed in the earlier explained side reactions of DBP. A weaker intensity peak to the upfield of the primary quartet also appeared in CatDE-1,2; however, its origin cannot be proposed at present. As described above, a few alkoxy species related to Ti were present in the prepared catalysts. Therefore, all the peaks within the range of 3.25–3.50 ppm (Fig. 2) of the methylene region were assumed to be from TiCl3(OR) compounds. These peaks were used to determine the alkoxy content of a catalyst. Table 2 summarizes the overall quantitative NMR analysis results. As can be seen in Fig. 1, each of the catalysts contained a non-negligible amount of residual n-heptane. Hence, the quantity of an organic component was derived as a solvent-corrected mole fraction after excluding the amount of n-heptane from a catalyst. As mentioned earlier, EB and DE were solely present as an ID in the case of EB- and DE-based catalysts. On the other hand, DBP, as well as ethoxy- and chloride-substituted species contributed as IDs in the case of DBP-based catalysts (see Table 1). For CatDBP-3,4, the ethyl content was higher than CatDBP-1,2, while the chlorine content was zero. These facts suggest that TiCl3OEt was produced mainly in the first TiCl4 treatment during catalyst preparation and thus formed TiCl3OEt reacted via transesterification with DBP. The alkoxy content varied in the range of 0.50–1.37 mol%, depending on the ID type. It increased in the order of DBP < DE < EB. The lower alkoxy content of the DBP-based catalysts can be (partly) explained by the consumption of TiCl3OEt in the transesterification reaction with DBP. The product TiCl3(OnBu) formed in this reaction was possibly more effectively dissolved than TiCl3OEt by hot toluene and TiCl4 during catalyst preparation [40]. The number of TiCl4 treatment during catalyst preparation also largely influenced the alkoxy content. It varied in the range of 0.50–2.06 mol%, being the lowest and highest for CatDBP-2 and CatDBP-3. A 3–4 times higher alkoxy content of CatDBP-3,4 compared with CatDBP-1,2 was likely because of the presence of a higher amount of surface TiCl3(OR) compounds in these catalysts. Moreover, to find the direct impact of TiCl3(OR) compounds on the catalytic activity, another parameter, alkoxy/Ti mole ratio, was determined for all catalysts. This alkoxy/Ti mole ratio varied in a narrow range of 0.25–0.38 (mol/mol), depending on the ID type. In contrast, it varied in a wide range of 0.25–0.75 (mol/mol), depending on the number of TiCl4 treatment during catalyst preparation. The large deviation in the alkoxy/Ti mole ratio between CatDBP-1,2 and CatDBP-3,4 suggests that in the second TiCl4 treatment during catalyst preparation, any residual Mg(OEt)2 converted to MgCl2, and TiCl4 replaced a major amount of surface TiCl3(OR) compounds. Propylene polymerization experiments were conducted using selected catalysts and the results are presented in Table 3 . A fixed set of polymerization conditions was employed. CMDMS, which is widely used in industries for fourth- as well as for fifth-generation ZN systems [8,9], was selected as a standard ED for a fair comparison of the polymerization results. On the other hand, additional polymerization was also performed using EB as the ED for CatEB-1 (run 2) and without an ED for CatDE-2 (run 8), to be in line with historically used combinations for a third- and a fifth-generation ZN systems [8]. First, the general tendency of the obtained results is explained as follows. The catalysts exhibited a moderate to high activity expressed as the polymerization rate per mole of Ti. Runs 1,3 and 5,6 represent the reproducibility of the experiments. Among all polymerization runs, the span of the catalyst activity was substantially large (3760–21600 kg-PP/mol-Ti h, which indicated that all the visible factors, such as the molecular structure of an ID, a combination effect between an ID and an ED, and the number of TiCl4 treatment during catalyst preparation, possibly influenced the activity. Using CMDMS as the ED, the activity of different catalysts varied in the order of DBP > DE > EB. CMDMS, in comparison to EB, resulted in a marginally superior activity of CatEB-1 (run 1 vs. 2). On the other hand, the use of CMDMS was somewhat detrimental to the activity of CatDE-2 (run 7 vs. 8). As a matter of fact, when the ID is a 1,3-diether compound, the addition of an ED may not require as the ID is not supposed to be displaced from the catalyst surface by the alkyl aluminium cocatalyst [8,38]. The catalyst activity greatly improved when the TiCl4 treatment was doubled (run 4 vs. 5/6), even for the same ID. All the results are consistent with the general understanding of propylene polymerization by ZN catalysts [7–9,41], while they enable a systematic comparison of the performance of three successive generations of ZN catalysts prepared from the Mg(OEt)2 precursor. Next, according to the purpose, we tried to understand the impact of by-products on the catalyst activity. Fig. 3a plots the activity against the alkoxy content of the catalysts for all the polymerization experiments. The activity rapidly decreased with the increase of the alkoxy content and then approached an almost constant value over the alkoxy content of 1.50 mol%. This trend confirms that residual TiCl3(OR) compounds sensitively deteriorated the catalyst activity in propylene polymerization. Previous studies of Lee [28] and others [27,29,30] found the negative impact of alkoxy (or ethoxy) compounds on the activity of a series of catalysts prepared by using the same internal donor but varying other catalyst preparation conditions, such as the number of TiCl4 treatment, TiCl4 feed rate, solvent, and the activation temperature. Unlike previous studies, a clear negative correlation between the activity and the alkoxy content is seen in Fig. 3a, even for the catalysts with different IDs. This is one of the new findings of the present study. Here we assume that TiCl3(OR) by-products behaved as spectators during polymerization, and the TiCl4 species present in a catalyst decided the productivity in propylene polymerization. Under this assumption, at first, we determined the effective Ti (Tieffect) amount by subtracting the amount of TiCl3(OR) compounds from the total amount of Ti in a catalyst. After that, the activity at each polymerization run was evaluated based on the amount of Tieffect, and the results are reported in Table 3. Fig. 3b plots the activity determined based on the amount of Tieffect against the alkoxy content of the catalysts. To our surprise, a negative correlation was found in Fig. 3b, which would propose TiCl3(OR) compounds as poisonous rather than merely inactive by-products of the prepared ZN catalysts. One potential explanation is that (at least) a fraction of TiCl3(OR) compounds might coadsorb with TiCl4 on MgCl2 surfaces and form inactive or poorly active dinuclear Ti species through alkoxy bridges. However, it should be noted that a relatively large dispersion along the trend line exists in Fig. 3b, indicating that the difference of the activity did not solely arise from the difference in the amount of TiCl3(OR) compounds present in the catalysts. In other words, the activity was likely influenced by the changes in both structure and chemical compositions of the catalysts upon the variation of the ID and the number of TiCl4 treatment during catalyst preparation. Finally, the polymer characteristics (Table 4 ) are explained as follows. The average molecular weight (M w) of the produced polymers is comparable to that of commercial polypropylene (PP). The differences in the isospecificity and H2 response of the catalyst systems would explain the small variation of the molecular weight among the produced polymers. The M w/M n values ranged between 3.8 and 6.4, suggesting the multisite nature of the employed catalysts. The relatively small M w/M n values of the polymers produced with the DE-based catalyst systems arose from the ID induced preferential growth of MgCl2 crystal along the 110 direction [8,13], leading to a narrower distribution of active sites compared with the EB- and DBP-based catalysts. Table 4 also summarizes the results of stereoregularity distribution analysis performed by using TREF. Here, OS represents the ODCB-soluble amorphous fraction, OI represents the ODCB-insoluble crystalline fraction, and T p represents the peak elution temperature of the OI fraction of PP. It is known that the OS fraction contains poorly isotactic, while the OI fraction contains isotactic PP chains [9,19]. The OS and OI fractions can be roughly considered to be produced by aspecific and isospecific active sites. These active sites can undergo interconversion, as suggested by the stereoblock nature of PP chains of both the OS and the OI fractions [9,19]. Also, it is known that the T p is generally correlated with the degree of stereoregularity of the highly crystalline fraction [41,42]. Thus, the amounts of aspecific and isospecific active sites of a catalyst and the isospecificity of the main active sites would determine the amounts of the OS and the OI fractions, and the T p of the OI fraction. In general, the formation of aspecific and isospecific active sites, as well as the isospecificity of the main active sites, depends on the state and location of Ti species on MgCl2 surfaces and the presence and absence of donor molecules in their vicinity [8–10,23]. It is to be noted that an ID can influence the amount and distribution of TiCl4 in a catalyst by inducing the exposure of specific lateral surface(s) of MgCl2 crystal on which the ID and TiCl4 competitively adsorb or coadsorb close to one another [8–10,23]. Thus, the ID modification can significantly influence the amounts of the OS and the OI fractions, and the T p of the OI fraction, as can be seen from Table 4. Using CMDMS as the ED, the OS fraction of polymers produced with different catalysts decreased in the order of EB > DE > DBP; as a matter of fact, the OI fraction of the polymers produced with the DBP- and DE-based catalysts exceeded over 95 wt%, a value usually requires for industrial catalysts. The T p of the OI fraction of the polymers produced with these catalyst systems increased in the order of EB < DE < DBP. Moreover, the same order was observed for the molecular weight of the polymers. It is known that the increase of isospecificity accompanies a greater propagation rate constant (k p) and a lower probability for chain transfer reactions [10,20,43]. Therefore, the relationship between the increase in the T p and the molecular weight consistently suggests that the isospecificity of the main active sites increased upon the ID modification. A combination effect between an ID and an ED on the polymer characteristics can also be seen from Table 4. In comparison with CMDMS, the use of EB as the ED, marginally decreased the OS fraction, increased the T p of the OI fraction, and the molecular weight of the polymer produced with CatEB-1. The positive influence of EB in terms of the polymer characteristics is in accordance with the fact that EB is the preferred ED for a third-generation ZN system [8]. On the other hand, the presence and absence of an ED did not make any difference in the amount of the OS fraction of the polymers produced with CatDE-2. It is known that when the ID is an aromatic ester, it tends to be extracted from MgCl2 surfaces by the alkyl aluminium cocatalyst [5,8]. Thus, in the absence of an ED, the amount of aspecific active sites gradually increases on contact of the catalyst with the cocatalyst [43]. As mentioned earlier, a 1,3-diether compound, on the other hand, is difficult to be displaced from surfaces by the alkyl aluminium cocatalyst, which would explain why the OS fraction of the polymer made with CatDE-2 did not increase in the absence of an ED. However, the use of CMDMS as the ED slightly increased the T p of the OI fraction and the molecular weight of the polymer produced with CatDE-2, suggesting a small improvement of isospecificity of the main active sites. These facts were likely due to ID/ED exchange events, during which CMDMS molecules replaced (a fraction of) DE molecules from the catalyst surface and improved the isospecificity of the neighboring active sites. A smaller amount of the OS fraction, a higher T p of the OI fraction, and a higher molecular weight were observed for the polymer produced with CatDBP-2 compared to those made with CatDBP-3,4, indicating the positive influence of the number of TiCl4 treatment during catalyst preparation on the polymer characteristics. Unlike the case of catalyst activity, the impacts of TiCl3(OR) compounds on the polymer characteristics were less prominent. No clear correlation between any of the properties and the alkoxy content was found for all polymerization experiments. However, upon comparison with an excerpt of the polymerization experiments conducted using CMDMS as the ED (Fig. 4), a positive correlation can be seen between the alkoxy content and the amount of the OS fraction of the polymers, while a negative correlation can be seen between the alkoxy content and the T p of the OI fraction of the polymers. These correlations further improved in Fig. 5 upon a comparison of the polymerization experiments conducted using the DBP-based catalysts, suggesting that TiCl3(OR) compounds tended to increase the amount of non-selective (aspecific) active sites and (slightly) decrease the isospecificity of the main active sites of a catalyst. It seems likely that TiCl3(OR) compounds by itself can polymerize propylene with low efficiency to produce poorly stereoregular PP chains. However, the mechanism by which TiCl3(OR) compounds affect the isospecificity of the main active sites of a catalyst remains unclear. Therefore, further investigations are required to clarify this mechanism. 4 Conclusions In the present contribution, we characterized and quantified the organic components contained in Mg(OEt)2-based Ziegler-Natta (ZN) catalysts using 1D and 2D NMR measurements of 1H and 13C nuclei in solution. A deuterated polar solvent, namely, DMSO-d 6, was employed to dissolve the ZN catalysts. The aprotic nature of this solvent and the absence of acid enabled the acquisition of NMR spectra without affecting the molecular structure of various compounds of interest. Emphasis was given to characterize the by-products that formed during catalyst preparation and remained in the catalysts. Two kinds of by-products were identified: One originated from side reactions of an internal donor (ID) during catalyst preparation, whereas another kind of by-products, related to titanium alkoxy compounds, formed in the conversion of Mg(OEt)2 to MgCl2 by reaction with TiCl4. The formation and the amount of these by-products were dependent on the ID type and catalyst preparation conditions such as the activation temperature and the number of TiCl4 treatment. Propylene polymerization experiments were conducted with selected catalysts and obtained polypropylene (PP) samples were characterized in terms of the molecular weight and stereoregularity distributions to understand the impacts of by-products on the polymerization performance. The major findings are summarized below. i) Irrespective of the ID type, the activity was strongly affected by the presence of titanium alkoxy by-products. The negative impact could not be explained by considering the titanium alkoxy by-products merely as spectators during polymerization. ii) Titanium alkoxy by-products tended to increase the amount of the amorphous fraction in produced PP. iii) Titanium alkoxy by-products tended to decrease the stereoregularity of the highly crystalline fraction of produced PP. From the polymerization results, titanium alkoxy compounds are concluded to be poisonous by-products of ZN catalysts. Mechanistic investigations can be done in the future to establish the mode of action of titanium alkoxy by-products. However, even without such investigations, the present study has successfully established that the alkoxy content of ZN catalysts determined using solution-state NMR spectroscopy can be an excellent indicator for improving both the catalyst activity and PP properties.

        "dc:description": "Chemical routes for preparing Ziegler-Natta (ZN) catalysts accompany the formation of by-products that remain in final catalysts in different amounts. In the history of ZN catalysts, much less emphasis has been given to analyze such by-products present in catalysts. Herein, we prepared various Mg(OEt)2-based ZN catalysts and conducted solution-state NMR measurements to characterize and quantify the organic components of these catalysts. It was found that, depending on the molecular structure of the internal donor (ID) and catalyst preparation conditions, an ID can undergo side reactions to produce organic by-products. All the catalysts contained different amounts of titanium alkoxy by-products formed in the reaction between Mg(OEt)2 and TiCl4, which were detrimental for the catalyst activity. These by-products were responsible for increasing the amount of the amorphous fraction in polypropylene and decreasing the highly crystalline fraction's stereoregularity. Possible hypotheses to explain the negative impacts of titanium alkoxy by-products are discussed.",
