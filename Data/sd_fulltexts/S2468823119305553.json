Department of Chemistry University of Patras Patras GR-26504 Greece Graphical abstract Upon selective deoxygenation of waste cooking oil the green diesel yield is maximized over a Ni-Al2O3 co-precipitated catalyst with 80 wt % Ni loading. Three nickel-alumina catalysts were prepared with nickel content 60, 80 and 90 wt % (symbols: 60NiAl, 80NiAl, 90NiAl) following a co-precipitation methodology. The catalysts were characterized and evaluated in the selective deoxygenation of waste cooking oil for the production of third generation green diesel under solvent free conditions. Metallic Ni, NiO, and NiAl2O4 were detected in the 60NiAl catalyst. NiAl2O4 is hardly detected in the 80NiAl catalyst but not at all in the 90NiAl catalyst. The extent of reduction of NiO to metallic Ni upon activation is considerably higher in the 80NiAl and 90NiAl samples with respect to the 60NiAl sample resulting in much higher active site population. The increase in the nickel content causes a change in the porous structure and a decrease in the specific surface area. The catalytic performance increases considerably from the 60NiAl catalyst to the 80NiAl one due to the increase in the active site population. The higher catalytic performance of the 80NiAl catalyst with respect to that of the 90NiAl catalyst, exhibiting almost equal active site population, is due to convenient porous structure of 80NiAl catalyst, which hinder the insertion of deleterious bulky compounds present in the waste cooking oil, as well as to its strong acid sites. Keywords Green diesel Renewable diesel Waste cooking oils Biofuels Nickel catalysts 1 Introduction The catalytic transformation of natural triglycerides into C15-C18 n-alkanes (green diesel) over nickel non-sulphided catalysts supported on various carriers has gained much interest in the last decade [1–6]. The domain has been recently reviewed by our group [7]. This transformation takes place by hydrotreatment in the temperature range 240–360 °C and hydrogen pressure 10–80 bar. The removal of oxygen without fragmentation of the side chains of triglycerides, selective deoxygenation (SDO), may proceeds through decarboxylation (deCO2), decarbonylation-dehydration (deCO–deH2O) and/or dehydration (deH2O). Following a recently proposed terminology for biodiesel [8], one can classify green diesel in four generations according to the raw triglyceride material used (first generation: edible vegetable oils, second generation: non-edible vegetable oils, third generation: residual vegetable oils and animal fats, and fourth generation: algal oils). In the most of studies fresh edible vegetable oils are used as sources of natural triglycerides. However, the use of such oils compete the production of foods. Therefore, replacing fresh edible oils by residual materials, like waste cooking oils (WCO), for producing third generation green diesel is extremely useful. The exploitation of WCO to produce fuels not only solves waste problem but also recycles energy [9]. Nowadays, WCO is readily available in large quantity and presents a cost effective resource for biofuel production [10]. Nevertheless, studies dealing with the use of WCO for the production of third generation green diesel are relatively few [7,10–18]. In the last years we have contributed to this domain by developing a co-precipitation methodology ensuring severe control of the precipitation parameters. Co-precipitation leads to Ni catalysts with high metal surface area (desired for hydrogen splitting) and less amount of strong acid sites (desired to avoid extended hydrocracking) [19]. Recently, Cao et al. [20] following a similar methodology have prepared high Ni-loading catalysts (50 mol %) with highly dispersed Ni nanoparticles, which showed excellent catalytic performance in benzonitrile hydrogenation. Following co-precipitation we have also succeeded to prepare nickel-alumina [21] and nickel-zirconia [22] catalysts with high specific surface area and small supported nickel nanocrystals even for catalysts with very high nickel content. Thus, catalysts with very high active surface have been prepared. These catalysts exhibited high performance, even under solvent free conditions and very high vegetable oil volume to catalyst mass ratio (100 mL/1 g). The activity was further increased by applying the co-precipitation methodology for preparing molybdenum [18,23] and zinc [24] promoted nickel-alumina catalysts. In almost all cases sunflower oil (SO) has been used as source of natural triglycerides. The replacement of the SO by WCO is the main pursuit of the present work. Previous catalytic tests had indicated that nickel catalysts with high nickel content and suitable pore size distribution are required for obtaining high catalytic performance in the transformation of WCO into green diesel [22,23]. Therefore, the present study focuses on the preparation, characterization and evaluation of three nickel-alumina catalysts with nickel loadings 60, 80 and 90 wt % symbolized by 60NiAl, 80NiAl and 90NiAl, respectively. These catalysts were prepared using the aforementioned co-precipitation procedure. Moreover, in order to rationalize the catalytic behavior, important physiochemical properties of WCO were investigated vis-à-vis to SO. 2 Experimental The catalysts were prepared by co-precipitation at constant pH from aqueous solutions containing Al(NO3)3*9H2O, (E. Merck) and Ni(NO3)2*6H2O (Merck, kGaA). Ammonium hydroxide solution (NH4OH 30%, Carlo Erba Reagents) was used for regulating the pH. Proper amounts of the above salts were dissolved in distilled water. The solution was fed by a syringe pump to a 500 mL beaker containing 180 mL of distilled water. The pH was initially adjusted to pH = 8 and maintained constant during preparation using a pH-stat (Metrohom-645). A bare alumina sample was also prepared following the same procedure without adding nickel nitrate. The solids obtained by filtration were dried at 110 °C overnight, heated under argon flow (30 mL/min) for 40 min, required for the increase of temperature from room temperature to 400 °C, and then were reduced at 400 °C for 2.5 h under hydrogen flow (30 mL/min). The activated catalysts were characterized using the following techniques. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were recorded in a Micromeritics apparatus (Tristar 3000 porosimeter). Specific Surface Area (SSABET) calculation was based on BET equation using adsorption data recorded at relative N2 pressure in the range 0.03 < P/P0<0.5. Pore size distribution was determined using the BJH method and the N2 desorption curve. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded in the range of 10° ≤ 2θ ≤ 80o by a Bucker D8 Advance diffractometer equipped with nickel-filtered Cu Kα (1.5418 Å) radiation source working at 40 kV and 20 mA. The step size and the time per step were respectively fixed at 0.02o and 0.5 s. The mean crystallite size was estimated using Scherrer’s equation. Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive Spectrometry (SEM-EDS) was used for the determination of catalysts percentage composition in nickel. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEMJEOL JSM6300) equipped with an Energy Dispersive Spectrometry accessory has been used working with 20 kV accelerating voltage and 10 nA beam current. Microanalysis was performed on gold coated samples. The sample powders were mounted directly on the sample holder. Transmittance Electron Microscopy (TEM) was used for recording TEM images of the catalysts in a JEOL JEM-2100 system operated at 200 kV (resolution: point 0.23 nm, lattice 0.14 nm) equipped with an Erlangshen CCD Camera (Gatan, Model 782 ES500W). The specimens were prepared by dispersion in water and spread onto a carbon-coated copper grid (200 meshes). NH 3 -TPD experiments were performed in laboratory-constructed equipment. In a typical experiment, 100 mg of the pre-reduced catalyst were placed in a quartz micro-reactor and helium was fed (flow rate 30 mL min−1) for 30 min in order to remove any adsorbed species from the catalyst surface. Then, a stream of NH3 was fed in the micro-reactor for 30 min at room temperature and then it was switched to He to remove the physically adsorbed ammonia. The temperature was then increased linearly (10 °C/min) up to 500 °C. The amount of the desorbed ammonia was determined by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). CO-chemisorption was performed on the aforementioned laboratory-constructed equipment following pulse technique. 100 mg of the pre-reduced catalyst were placed in the quartz micro-reactor and He was fed (40 mL min−1) until a constant base line to be obtained. The CO uptake was measured at 30 °C by successive injection of 0.5 mL of CO samples (10% v/v in He) via calibrated loop of a six-port valve into He carrier until saturated peak was detected by TCD in the reactor outlet. The catalyst surface was washed with He for half an hour and a second cycle of successive injections was performed. The chemically adsorbed CO was calculated by subtracting the CO adsorbed during the second cycle from that of the first one. Precursor samples (after Ar treatment at 400 °C and before reduction) were characterized by H 2 -TPR experiments performed in the same laboratory-constructed equipment. An amount of sample, 0.04 g, was placed in the quartz reactor and the reducing gas mixture (H2/Ar: 5/95 v/v) was passed through it for 2 h with a flow rate of 40 mL min−1 at room temperature. Then the temperature was increased to 1000 °C with a constant rate of 10 °C min−1. Reduction leads to a decrease of the hydrogen concentration of the gas mixture, which was detected by the TCD. The reducing gas mixture was dried in a cold trap (−95 °C) before reaching the TCD. The catalysts were evaluated for transformation of WCO to green diesel under solvent free conditions at 310 °C, 40 bar hydrogen pressure, WCO volume to catalyst mass ratio 100 mL/1 g and various reaction times up to 9 h. A falling basket batch reactor (300 ml, Autoclave Engineers), working in a semi-batch mode with hydrogen flow rate 100 mL/min, has been used. The WCO used in this study, was obtained by a local company, “COLLECTOIL”. It was filtered three times using cloth filters of different sizes and then it was centrifuged prior to its use. The analysis of the liquid samples was performed by gas chromatography and confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. More details concerning preparation, characterization and evaluation of the catalysts have been reported in references [8,10–13]. SO and WCO were characterized using TGA, FT-ATR, GC–MS whereas their important physicochemical properties (acidity, viscosity, iodine number and water content) have been determined [25]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Composition and physicochemical properties of WCO It should be taken into account that the major portion of the WCO, drawn from the Greek restaurants, is manly produced by cooking SO. The determination of characteristic parameters has shown that WCO exhibits higher static and dynamic viscosity (9.89 cSt, 0.088 P) than SO (7.39 cSt, 0.066 P) as well as lower iodine number than SO (WCO: 67, SO: 120–134). Both can be attributed to the acidic polymerization of a small portion of triglycerides upon cooking starting from the double olefinic CC bonds of their side chains. The increase in the viscosity upon cooking can be also partly attributed to the presence of potato starch or meat proteins in the WCO inserted in the SO upon cooking. The presence of polymeric compounds, starch and proteins in the WCO is also investigated by comparing the TGA curves of SO and WCO illustrated in Fig. 1 . Inspection of this figure shows that the TGA curves are almost identical in the range 25–450 °C due to the triglyceride structure of both raw materials. This is also confirmed by the almost identical FT-ATR spectra recorded for both of them (Fig. 2 ). However, returning to the TGA curves we are observing that the weight of SO takes a zero value at about 450 °C whereas a small amount of WCO remains in the range 400–450 °C. This indicates the presence of more difficultly sublimated compounds, much probable polymers, starch and proteins. However, the weight of WCO takes a zero value after heating the sample at 450 °C for 0.5 h. The determination of characteristic parameters has shown that WCO exhibits higher acidity expressed in oleic acid (WCO: 0.83%, SO: 0.60%). This can be attributed to the partial dissociation of the natural triglycerides to fatty acids upon cooking. In fact, small amounts of stearic acid are identified in the GC chromatograms of the WCO (not shown here) together with small amounts of mono and di-glycerides produced by progressive dissociation of a small portion of triglycerides. The water content of the two feedstocks was also determined and was found to be different (WCO: 0.14 wt %, SO: 0.04 wt %). In view of the above one can conclude that besides the differences in acidity and water content, an important difference between SO and WCO is the presence of bulky compounds in the latter. 3.2 Solid phases The compositions of the catalysts determined by EDS are very close to the nominal ones. The crystal phases of the catalysts studied were investigated by XRD and electron diffraction whereas the distribution of the solid phases was investigated by TEM. The XRD patterns of the catalysts studied are illustrated in Fig. 3 . Inspection of the XRD patterns shows the presence of metallic nickel [peaks at 2θ: 44.5, 51.8 and 76.3°, JCPDS 04-0850] and nickel oxide [peaks at 2θ: 43.4, 37.3 and 62.9°, JCPDS 01–1239] on the catalysts studied. Small amounts of nickel aluminate are detected in the sample 60NiAl [shoulders at 2θ: 45.0 and 65.5, JCPDS 01–1239]. Nickel aluminate is very hardly detected, in the 80NiAl catalyst but not in the 90NiAl catalyst. The absence of peaks corresponding to alumina crystals strongly suggests that the alumina formed is amorphous. Comparison of the height of the peak at 2θ: 44.5° with that at 2θ: 43.4° shows that the minimum ratio Ni/NiO is obtained in the 60NiAl sample and the maximum one in the sample 80NiAl. This indicates that in the latter sample the highest extend of NiO reduction towards the catalytically active metallic nickel is achieved upon activation. The mean crystal size of the metallic nickel calculated on the base of diffraction peak at 2θ: 51.8° was found to be equal to 9.6, 11.2 and 10.9 nm for the 60NiAl, 80NiAl and 90NiAl catalysts, respectively. The XRD results are confirmed by the electron diffraction results. Thus, the electron diffraction pattern of the sample 60NiAl showed the presence of Ni, NiO and NiAl2O4 nanocrystals whereas the electron diffraction patterns of the samples 80NiAl and 90NiAl showed the presence of only Ni and NiO nanocrystals. A typical electron diffraction pattern for the most active catalyst, 80NiAl, is illustrated in Fig. 4 . The TEM images recorded for the catalysts studied depict the distribution of their solid phases at nanoscale. Typical examples are illustrated in Fig. 5 . The TEM images of the catalyst 60NiAl display two regions; one with relatively small nickel phase nanoparticles separated by areas comprised from very small alumina nanoparticles (Fig. 5a) and another one with relatively big nickel phase nanoparticles separated by mixed areas comprised from smaller and smaller nickel phase nanoparticles and very small alumina nanoparticles (Fig. 5b). The second picture predominates in the 80NiAl (Fig. 5c) and 90NiAl catalysts (Fig. 5d). The separating areas are wider in the 80NiAl catalyst. 3.3 Textural properties and metallic nickel surface Table 1 compiles important parameters of the catalysts studied concerning their texture probed by N2 physisorption and metallic area investigated by pulse CO adsorption experiments. Inspection of Table 1 shows that although the specific surface area decreases with nickel content, thanks to the preparation methodology applied it remains adequately high, even in the catalyst with nickel content as high as 90 wt %. The relatively high SSABET values are compatible to the mesoporous texture of the catalysts inferred by inspecting Fig. 6 . The change of nickel content is accompanied by considerable changes in the pore volume distributions. The 60NiAl catalyst exhibits a double peak centered at 3 and 5 nm and a broad one in the range 12–100 nm. The catalyst 80NiAl exhibits its main peak at about 7 nm and a smaller size peak in the range 18–100 nm. The no formation of pores with 3 and 5 nm diameter in the 80NiAl catalyst is reflected in the decrease of its SSABET whereas the smaller size of the peak in the range above 10 nm is in accordance with its decreased SPV value (Table1). Finally, the 90NiAl catalyst exhibits a broad pore volume distribution with a main maximum in the range 10–20 nm which is extended to higher than 100 nm justifying both the further decrease in SSABET and the impressive increase in the value of MPD (Table 1). It is well known that CO-chemisorption cannot be considered as an absolute quantification measure of metallic sites. This is mainly caused by the different ways CO-chemisorption occurs on the various sites. For Ni catalysts, the CO-chemisorption is affected by the metal content, the “Ni-support” interaction, the metal particles dispersion, and the presence of impurities. On the other hand, several possible modes of adsorption such as linear, bridged and carbonyl type adsorption have been observed [27] and metallic Ni centers can interact with two, even three CO molecules [28]. However, the low temperature CO-chemisorption contacted in our case is expected to lead mainly in linear adsorption on metallic Ni sites. Although, the quantification of chemisorbed CO with 1:1 stoichiometry per surface Ni atom is widely used in the recent literature for Ni surface area and dispersion determination [29], it is more realistic to consider the amount of chemisorbed CO (μmol/g catalyst) as a reliable parameter for comparison [28,30]. In this sense, the CO chemisorption results (Table 1) clearly show that the surface of metallic nickel increases with the nickel content. The increase is abrupt when going from the 60NiAl catalyst to the 80NiAl one. In fact, whereas the weight ratio in total nickel is equal to 80/60 = 1.33, the corresponding ratio in the amount of the adsorbed CO is 209/15 = 13.93. This can be explained considering that a great portion nickel in the 60NiAl catalyst is present as nickel oxide and nickel aluminate relatively not active in the CO adsorption. This is not the case for the 80NiAl catalyst where according to the XRD and electron diffraction results it is obtained the highest extent of NiO reduction to metallic nickel and where nickel aluminate is not present. Moreover, combining the XRD, electron diffraction and CO adsorption results we incline to argue that nickel oxide and nickel aluminate relatively small nanocrystals presumably predominate in regions of the 60NiAl catalyst pictured in the up- left image of Fig. 5. The increase in the nickel metallic surface follows the increase of the nickel content when going from the 80NiAl catalyst to the 90NiAl one. In fact, the weight ratio in total nickel is equal to 90/80 = 1.12 and the corresponding ratio in the amount of the adsorbed CO is 227/209 = 1.08. The slightly lower value in the latter ratio could be attributed to the smaller extend of NiO reduction in the 90NiAl catalyst with respect to the 80NiAl catalyst deduced by XRD. 3.4 Catalysts reducibility and acidity The XRD, electron diffraction, TEM and CO adsorption findings are corroborated by the H2-TPR results illustrated in Fig. 7 . Before discussing the H2–TPR curves it is useful to mention that the reduction time upon activation at 400 °C is much higher (2.5 h) than the very small reduction time upon the transient H2-TPR procedure. This allows us to assume that the hydrogen consumption up to roughly 450 °C corresponds to the reduction of NiO nanocrystals to metallic nickel detected by XRD and electron diffraction in the reduced catalysts. The hydrogen consumption in the range 450–750 °C corresponds to the reduction of NiO nanocrystals non-reducible upon activation and thus they are detected by XRD and electron diffraction as nickel oxide. Finally, the hydrogen consumption in the range 750–800 °C corresponds to the reduction of nickel aluminate [18,31–35]. Let’s concentrate our attention to the H2-TPR curve of the 60NiAl catalyst. We are observing a peak at about 350 °C corresponding to quite large NiO nanocrystals weakly interacted with alumina [31,32] and thus easily reducible to quite large nickel nanocrystals (low dispersion). Moreover, the hydrogen consumption in the range 350–450 °C corresponding to smaller NiO nanocrystals moderately interacted with alumina [33,34] and resulting to better dispersed nickel nanocrystals is relatively low compared to the other two samples. In contrast, the hydrogen consumption above 450 °C corresponding to NiO nanocrystals non-reducible upon activation and nickel aluminate [35] is considerably higher compared to those of the other two catalysts. The above results are in full agreement to the XRD and electron diffraction results and justify the relatively low metallic nickel surface inferred by the CO adsorption. The increase in hydrogen consumption in the range 350–450 °C with the nickel content is in line with the increase in the amount of metallic nickel also inferred by the increase in the magnitude of the XRD peak at 51.8° and the increase in the CO adsorption. The decrease in hydrogen consumption in the range 500–750 °C with the nickel content reflects the decrease in the relative amount of NiO with respect to metallic nickel. Finally, nickel aluminate, reducible in the range 750–800 °C is indicated in the 60NiAl catalyst, hardly in the 80NiAl catalyst but not in the 90NiAl one, in agreement to the XRD results. The acidity of the catalysts was studied by NH3-TPD experiments. Fig. 8 illustrates the NH3-TPD curves. Fig. 8 illustrates the NH3-TPD curves of the catalysts studied and the bare alumina. All the samples exhibit high populations of weak acid sites (desorption temperature < 300 °C), small populations of sites with moderate acidity (300 °C < desorption temperature < 450 °C) and few strong acid sites, only in the sample 80NiAl (desorption temperature > 450 °C) [36]. We are observing that the bare alumina (0NiAl) exhibits the highest population of weak acid sites. This population decreases with the nickel content following approximately the decrease of the alumina content and the parallel decrease in the specific surface area (Table 1). This is an indication that the weak acid sites are mainly situated on the alumina surface. The observation that the moderately strong and very strong acid sites appear mainly on the surface of the Ni catalysts indicates that these are situated on the supported nickel phases. They could be related to the empty d orbitals of the metallic nickel and the Ni2+ ions in the supported nickel oxide and nickel aluminate which can interact with the lone pair of electrons of ammonia [37]. Taking into account the XRD results one can attribute the creation of moderately strong acid sites to all nickel phases while that of the very few strong acid sites mainly to the metallic Ni. The latter phase was found to be predominant in the 80NiAl catalyst. We shall return to this point after the evaluation of the catalysts performance. 3.5 Evaluation of the catalytic performance Before dealing with the catalytic behavior of the catalysts studied it is useful reminding the SDO of triglycerides network over nickel non-sulphided catalysts [7]. It is proceeding through the hydrogenation of olefinic bonds of the triglycerides followed by the decomposition of the OC bonds in the glycerol side and the formation of fatty acids and propane. The fatty acids are reduced to aldehydes and alcohols. The aldehydes are decarbonylated resulting to n‐C17 and n‐C15 alkanes and CO. The alcohols are dehydrated and the produced olefins are hydrogenated resulting to n‐C18 and n‐C16 alkanes. In parallel, the alcohols react with the fatty acids producing long chain esters with both hydrocarbons parts corresponding to fatty acids of triglycerides. The esters undergo SDO resulting to hydrocarbons. Thus fatty acids and esters are intermediate products. The CO produced may react with hydrogen producing methane. The most important products identified in the liquid phase were non-reacted triglycerides, long chain esters with both hydrocarbon parts corresponding to fatty acids of triglycerides, palmitic and stearic acid (mainly stearic acid) and normal alkanes, n-C15–n-C18, whereas CO, propane and methane have been identified in the gas phase. The above products are expected from the reaction network described just before. Typical kinetic curves for the catalyst 80NiAl are presented in Fig. 9 . It is seen that the conversion increases considerably even for reaction time of 1 h indicating that the first steps of the SDO network (hydrogenation of olefinic bonds of the triglycerides, decomposition of the O‐C bonds in the glycerol side) are very rapid in agreement to the literature [7,17,18]. Moreover, the kinetic curves show maxima concerning the acid and esters evolution indicating that these molecules are actually intermediate ones in agreement to the reaction network. On the other hand, the evolution of the hydrocarbons, as final products, follows a rather linear kinetic curve. In almost all cases the amounts of n-alkanes with even number carbon atoms (principally n-C17) is much higher than the amounts of the hydrocarbons with odd number of carbon atoms, indicating that the process proceeds mainly through the decarbonylation of the intermediate aldehydes which is the case of nickel metallic catalysts [7]. In conclusion, the replacement of the SO by WCO does not seem to affect generally the triglyceride SDO network. The comparative evaluation of the catalysts studied is presented for the maximum reaction time (Fig. 10 ). As it is seen complete conversion of WCO (100%) is achieved under reaction conditions used over all the catalysts studied. However, the liquid product distribution obtained depends on the catalyst used. It is seen that the total amount of the hydrocarbons produced in the diesel range, the most important evaluation parameter from the catalytic point of view, follows a volcano-like trend maximized over the 80NiAl catalyst. The value obtained over this catalyst, equal to 36 ± 2% is quite high taking into account the very high ratio of WCO volume to catalyst mass adopted in the present work. Moreover, this is considerably higher than that obtained over the 60NiAl catalyst (13 ± 2%) and quite higher than that obtained over the 90NiAl catalyst (29 ± 2%). The increase of the catalytic performance from the 60NiAl catalyst to the 80NiAl can be mainly attributed to the increase in the active site population inferred by the CO adsorption. It is well known that the reduction of intermediate free fatty acids to the corresponding aldehydes is the rate determining step of the triglycerides SDO network [7]. This step is catalyzed by active sites situated on the metallic nickel [7]. Thus, the highest green diesel yield achieved over the 80NiAl catalyst is easily explained. In contrast, the change in the active site population cannot explain the decrease of the catalytic performance going from the 80NiAl catalyst to the 90NiAl one. Indeed, considering the chemisorbed CO (Table 1) as a relative measure of metallic nickel site population one can conclude that active site populations in these two samples are almost equal. Therefore, two additional observations should be taken into account in order to explain the achievement of the maximum catalytic performance over the 80NiAl catalyst. The first concerns the presence of the very strong acid sites present exclusively in this catalyst (Fig. 8). These presumably involved in the decomposition of the bulky compounds being in WCO, mentioned in 3.1 subsection, which would eventually adsorbed and thus deactivate active sites. The second observation concerns the catalysts texture. As already mentioned, pores of about 7 nm are the predominant ones present in the 80NiAl catalyst. In contrast, pores with sizes extended from 15 up to higher than 100 nm are present in the 90NiAl catalyst (Fig. 6). One may assume that the WCO bulky compounds, probably acting as poisons, cannot easily inserted in the small pores of the 80NiAl catalyst justifying its very high performance in the SDO of WCO. Closing this section we have to stress that Ni leaching determination and catalysts reuse experiments are crucial for the application of such catalysts in real SDO processes of WCO. SEM – EDS experiments performed over fresh and used catalysts proved that the leaching of Ni phase is not important. This is in agreement with our previous studies on relevant catalysts [18]. It seems that the co-precipitation methodology used for catalysts preparation results to relatively strong metal-support interactions [38] preventing Ni leaching, ensuring also good catalyst stability, as no appreciable aggregation is usually observed in the spent catalysts [20]. 4 Conclusions Nickel-alumina nanostructured catalysts with nickel content in the range 60–90 wt % (60NiAl, 80NiAl and 90NiAl) are proved to be active in the transformation of WCO into green diesel under very high WCO volume/catalyst mass ratio and solvent free conditions. The catalytic performance follows a volcano-like trend maximized over the 80NiAl catalyst. The considerably high catalytic performance obtained over this catalyst with respect to that of the 60NiAl one is mainly attributed to its much higher metallic nickel surface compared to the latter catalyst. On the other hand, the higher catalytic performance of the 80NiAl catalyst with respect to the 90NiAl catalyst, exhibiting somewhat higher metallic nickel surface, is attributed not only to its convenient porous structure exhibiting pores with mean diameter about 7 nm, which hinder the insertion of deleterious bulky compounds present in the WCO, but also to few but strong acid sites present exclusively in the 80NiAl catalyst, which presumably are involved in the decomposition of these bulky compounds.

        "dc:description": "Three nickel-alumina catalysts were prepared with nickel content 60, 80 and 90 wt % (symbols: 60NiAl, 80NiAl, 90NiAl) following a co-precipitation methodology. The catalysts were characterized and evaluated in the selective deoxygenation of waste cooking oil for the production of third generation green diesel under solvent free conditions. Metallic Ni, NiO, and NiAl2O4 were detected in the 60NiAl catalyst. NiAl2O4 is hardly detected in the 80NiAl catalyst but not at all in the 90NiAl catalyst. The extent of reduction of NiO to metallic Ni upon activation is considerably higher in the 80NiAl and 90NiAl samples with respect to the 60NiAl sample resulting in much higher active site population. The increase in the nickel content causes a change in the porous structure and a decrease in the specific surface area. The catalytic performance increases considerably from the 60NiAl catalyst to the 80NiAl one due to the increase in the active site population. The higher catalytic performance of the 80NiAl catalyst with respect to that of the 90NiAl catalyst, exhibiting almost equal active site population, is due to convenient porous structure of 80NiAl catalyst, which hinder the insertion of deleterious bulky compounds present in the waste cooking oil, as well as to its strong acid sites.",
