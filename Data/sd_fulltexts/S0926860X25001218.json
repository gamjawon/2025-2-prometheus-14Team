The selective oxidation of methacrolein (MAL) to methacrylic acid (MAA) is a key step in C4 oxidation for polymethyl methacrylate production, but the limited catalytic activity of polyoxometalates (POMs) hinders their industrial use. Here, we synthesized POM-IL hybrid catalysts via ion exchange and calcination. Ionic liquids disrupted the POM structure through hydrogen bonding, creating oxygen vacancies that optimized adsorption energy and prevented MAL over-oxidation to COx. The hydrogen bonding between ionic liquids and polyoxometalate anions, coupled with ammonium ions derived from ionic liquids, generated a synergistic effect that markedly improves the acidity and redox properties of the catalyst. The catalyst achieved 82.9 % MAL conversion, 88.9 % MAA selectivity, and exceptional stability over 80 h. In-situ infrared spectroscopy and partial density of states (PDOS) analysis identified Mo=Od as the active site, with ester intermediate formation as the rate-determining step. This study uncovers the influence of hydrogen bonding in ionic liquids on the structure-activity relationship of polyoxometalate anions, offering crucial insights into the mechanism of methacrolein selective oxidation.

However, the current industrial production of MMA using the acetone cyanohydrin (ACH) process involves the use of highly toxic hydrogen cyanide (HCN), posing serious environmental and health risks. Consequently, recent research has focused on developing a cleaner C4 oxidation process to improve environmental sustainability and eliminate harmful substances. The C4 oxidation process consists of three steps: (1) conversion of tert-butanol or isobutene to methacrolein (MAL), (2) oxidation of MAL to methacrylic acid (MAA), and (3) conversion of MAA to MMA. Among these steps, the efficient production of MAA from MAL is crucial to the success of the C4 oxidation process [5–10]. Polyoxometalates, such as phosphomolybdate and phosphomolybdovanadate, are commonly used catalysts in the oxidation of MAL to MAA [11]. However, these catalysts often suffer from drawbacks such as low specific surface area and poor thermal stability, which result in low catalytic efficiency and limited catalytic lifetimes. Research has demonstrated that introducing Cs+ counterions to heteropolyacids enhances both their thermal stability and specific surface area. With increased cesium content, the specific surface area of phosphomolybdate rises from approximately 5 m2/g to over 50 m2/g [12]. Recently, researchers have modified cesium phosphomolybdovanadate salts to further improve their catalytic performance. For instance, Zhang et al. [13] observed that the incorporation of Cu2+ and Fe3+ ions enhanced the catalysts' redox capacity, leading to increased catalytic activity. The addition of NH4 + also modified the structural and catalytic properties of the catalysts. Cao et al. [14] synthesized and characterized a series of Cs(NH4 +)xH3-xPMo11VO40 catalysts with varying ammonium contents. Compared to CsH3PMo11VO40, the introduction of ammonium salts not only increased the specific surface area but also augmented the acidic site density. Additionally, electron transfer was enhanced, facilitating the reduction of V5+ to V4+. This resulted in an increased concentration of the reactive species (VO2+) involved in the MAL oxidation reaction. Li et al. [15] also proposed a novel method to synthesize defective CsH3PMo11VO40 through microwave-assisted precipitation for the oxidation of MAL to MAA. Their findings indicated that microwave treatment accelerated the nucleation rate of the catalyst and promoted the formation of oxygen vacancies. These vacancies improved the oxidative capacity of active Mo species, thereby enabling adsorbed oxygen activation to lattice oxygen, which promoted MAL oxidation [16–18]. Nonetheless, despite enhancements from counterions like Cu2+, Cs+, and NH4 +, the conversion rate of MAL and the selectivity for MAA remain suboptimal [19,20]. Ionic liquids (ILs) are molten salts composed of organic cations and anions. Through double displacement reaction, they can react with POMs to form POM-IL hybrid, a new class of organic-inorganic hybrid materials [21]. POM-IL hybrid exhibit excellent chemical properties and can be utilized in various reactions, including oxidative desulfurization (ODS) [22–26], benzene hydroxylation to phenol [27], and the oxidative conversion of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) [28]. Cao et al. [29] successfully synthesized [EMIM]PAVAC, achieving up to 98 % MAA selectivity in MAL oxidation. The generation of NH4 + during calcination could promote the reduction of V5+ to V4+, thus enhancing the redox capacity of the catalyst. Proton migration between the ionic liquid and polyoxometalate anions significantly enhances the catalyst's redox properties and helps form diverse hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. Gao et al. [30] found the hydrogen-bonding interactions between the ionic liquid and polyoxometalate anions can significantly modulate their structural characteristics and catalytic performance. However, systematic studies on the influence of hydrogen bonding effects in ionic liquids on the structure of polyoxometalate salts and their catalytic performance in methacrolein selective oxidation are still lacking. 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate, a highly acidic ionic liquid, has been recognized for its ability to efficiently dissolve cellulose in aqueous phases and to exhibit exceptional catalytic performance in various esterification reactions [31–33]. Additionally, this ionic liquid has been demonstrated as an effective additive to modify the crystal structure of electrolytes, significantly improving their overall performance [34,35]. Based on these properties, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate was chosen, and a novel POM-IL hybrid catalyst was successfully synthesized using ion exchange and calcination methods. Characterization results revealed that the hydrogen bonding between ionic liquids and POM anions, along with the synergistic effect of ammonium ions derived from the ionic liquid, significantly enhanced the catalyst's acidity and redox properties. Additionally, hydrogen bonding was found to increase the number of oxygen vacancies in POM anions, thereby promoting gaseous oxygen adsorption and enhancing lattice oxygen replenishment.These changes led to a significant enhancement in catalytic activity. In-situ infrared spectroscopy identified the terminal Mo=Od site in the catalyst as the active site for MAL oxidation. DFT calculations revealed that the formation of ester intermediates at the terminal Mo=Od site is the rate-determining step in MAL oxidation. The catalyst achieved an 82.9 % conversion rate of MAL and 88.9 % selectivity for MAA under atmospheric pressure at 310 °C. These findings highlight the POM-IL hybrid catalyst's outstanding performance in MAL oxidation and offer critical insights for the design and application of industrial catalysts. 2 Experiment 2.1 Materials All chemicals were employed in their original state without any prior treatment. Methylacrolein (95 wt%), methacrylic acid, molybdenum trioxide (MoO3), acetic acid, vanadium pentoxide (V2O5), phosphoric acid (85 wt%), Ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3), copper nitrate (Cu(NO3)2), cesium nitrate (CsNO3), and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazole bisulfate ([BMIM]HSO4) were purchased from Aladdin Company. 2.2 Preparation of catalysts H4PMo11VO40 (HPAV) was prepared according to the literature [36]. Initially, 0.004 mol [BMIM]HSO4 was dispersed in deionized water to form solution A. In parallel, 0.004 mol of HPAV was dissolved in deionized water to prepare solution B. Simultaneously, 0.004 mol CsNO3 and 0.0008 mol Cu(NO3)2 were each dissolved in deionized water to form solution C. Then, solution A and C were added sequentially to solution B at 85 °C and stirred vigorously for 6 h continuously. The mixture was subjected to multiple centrifugation and washing cycles. Barium nitrate was then added to the wash solution until no more precipitate formed, indicating the completion of the washing process. Finally, the washed precipitate was dried overnight at 80°C, followed by further calcination at 350 °C for 12 h to obtain the final product, named (NH4 +)XCu0.2CsH4-X-1.2PMo11VO40 (BPAV). The synthesis process is illustrated in Scheme 1. The synthesis methods for Cu0.2CsH2.8PMo11VO40 (CPAV) and (NH4 +)Cu0.2CsH1.8PMo11VO40 (NPAV) are similar to the aforementioned process. The only difference for NPAV is that [BMIM]HSO4 is replaced with NH4HCO3 during the synthesis. All catalysts are pressed and sieved for catalytic testing. 2.3 Characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was conducted using a Smartlab 9 kW diffractometer (Japan) to study the crystal phase and crystallinity of the catalyst. The X-ray source was Cu-Kα with a wavelength of 0.15418 nm. The tube current was 100 mA, the tube voltage was 40 kV, and the scanning angle range was 2θ = 5–80°, with a scanning rate of 10°/min. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the sample were collected using a Thermo Nicolet 870 infrared spectrometer. Samples were prepared by mixing and grinding with KBr. They were tested with a resolution of 4 cm−1 and 32 scans in the wavenumber range of 400–4000 cm−1. Diffuse reflection UV–visible (UV–vis) spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV3600 spectrophotometer, tested at 200–800 nm with BaSO4 as the reference. Raman spectra were obtained using a Thermo Fischer DXR with a 100 mV laser and CCD detector. Thermogravimetric analysis (TG-DTA) was carried out on a Rigaku thermal gravimetric analyzer (Japan) to study the structural evolution of the catalyst precursor (15 mg). The sample was heated from room temperature to 600 °C in an alumina crucible at a rate of 15 °C/min under airflow. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) using Zeiss Gemini 300 field. The sample was fixed on the surface of the conductive adhesive and coated with gold. The scanning voltage was usually 5 kV and the scanning current was usually 10 μA. The pore structure of the relevant samples was observed using JEOL 794 transmission electron microscope from Japan. N2 adsorption and desorption were performed using an ASAP 2020 adsorbent instrument from Micromeritics, USA, and the samples were degassed at 180 °C for 4 h prior to measurement. The samples were tested using a PHI-5300 Versa Probe X-ray energy spectrometer (XPS) and Al K α (h) ν = 1486.6 eV monochromatic radiation was used as the radiation source, with an acceleration power of 15 kW. Before measurement, the sample was first processed in an ultra-high vacuum tube. After the test, the binding energy of the standard C1s (284.8 eV) was used for calibration. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectra (ICP-OES) (PerkinElmer 8300) was used to determine the actual amount of P/Mo/V/Cs in the catalyst. An EPR spectrometer (Bruke Emxplus, Germany) was used to perform EPR spectroscopy at room temperature in the X-band mode. The microwave power, resonance frequency, modulation width and time constant were 2 mW, 9.417 GHz, 0.5 mT and 0 s, respectively. Ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) was evaluated using Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 instrument equipped with thermal conductivity detector to assess the acidity of the catalyst. NH3-TPD curves from 50 to 650 °C was obtained with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. Temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was tested on the same equipment by weighing 30 mg of a 40–60 mesh sample in a sample tube and treating it at 200 °C for 2 h under the atmosphere of Ar, and then lowering it to 50 °C. The sample was treated at 200 °C for 2 h under Ar atmosphere, and then lowered to 50 °C. The change in H2 concentration in a 10 % H2/Ar atmosphere was measured using a TCD from room temperature to 700 °C at 10 °C/min. In situ IR spectroscopy was performed using German Bruker INVENIO-S. Approximately 10 mg of BPAV was compressed into KBr pellets (1 wt%) and loaded into a high-temperature IR cell. Next, the catalyst was treated by warming the battery in Ar gas (20 mL/min) at 310 °C (15 °C/min) for 2 h. 2.4 DFT calculations All calculations were carried out using the DMol 3 program in Materials Studio from Materials Inc [37]. The fact that all atoms were in a relaxed state ensured the accuracy of the calculation of the interaction between the MAL and the catalyst. The generalized gradient approximation of the PBE function was used to measure the exchange correlation energy. The interactions between the nuclei and electrons of metal atoms were calculated by the DSPP method, while other atoms were treated as all-electrons [38]. At the same time, the valence electron function was extended into atomic orbitals with a DNP basis and partial occupancies were calculated by means of 0.005 Hartree smearing value [39]. The adsorption configuration adopted a 2x1x1 Monkhorst Pack lattice. The convergence criteria for structural optimization were: allowable energy of 2 × 10−5 eV/atom, maximum force of 0.05 eV/atom and maximum displacement of 2 × 10−3 atom. The adsorption energy was calculated using the following formula: Eads=EHPAV-MAL-EMAL-EHPAV. The response coordinates were optimized using the Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) method. In NEB, each image was connected to its neighboring images through harmonic constraints, simulating the effect of an elastic band. The relaxation of the entire band towards the minimum energy path (MEP) was driven by adjusting the spring and atomic forces to ensure they were orthogonal to the reaction path. Force and energy calculations were performed using Grimme's three-modified Hartree-Fock method. The calculations continued until the maximum force on the atoms in all NEB images was less than 0.03 eV/Å, with a maximum number of iterations set to 300. 2.5 Catalytic testing The oxidation of MAL to MAA was studied in a fixed bed reactor under atmospheric pressure. 1 g catalyst was placed in the middle of the reaction tube and fixed with quartz wool. When the temperature was increased to 310 °C, the reactant mixture (4.4 % MAL, 65.7 % N2, 11.1 % O2, and 18.8 % H2O (mol. %)) was fed into the fixed bed reactor, and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was set from 900 h−1 to 3600 h−1. After the reaction stabilized, liquid phase products such as MAA, acetic acid, and MAL were analyzed by an Agilent GC7890B equipped with a DB-WAX capillary column and an FID detector. N-butanol was used as an internal standard. COx were detected using a gas chromatograph SP-6890 equipped with a Porapak Q packed column and a TCD detector. The conversion rate and selectivity after 3 h of reaction were calculated. The formulas for calculating the MAL conversion rate and product selectivity were as follows: CMAL (%) = (1-nMAL,product/nMAL,feed)× 100 Sproduct,I (%) = (ncarbon in product I,product/ncarbon in MAL,feed-ncarbon in MAL, product) × 100 Where C was MAL conversion, S was product (i) selectivity. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of catalysts We constructed a molecular model of the POM-IL hybrid precursor and conducted electrostatic potential analysis to clearly illustrate the positions of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors in the system, as well as their interaction modes. As shown in Fig. S1, the C-H bond between the two nitrogen atoms in the imidazole ring is identified as the hydrogen bond donor, while the oxygen atoms in the polyacid anion structure serve as the hydrogen bond acceptors, with the hydrogen bond formation taking the form of C-H···O. Organic elemental analysis and ICP-OES were employed to determine the elemental contents of H, N, S, Cu, Cs, P, Mo, and V in the catalysts (Table S1). The elemental composition of BPAV was found to match the theoretical values, from which the structural formula was deduced as (NH4 +)XCu0.2CsH4-X-1.2PMo11VO40. Fig. 1a displays the XRD analysis results of all catalysts. Except for HPAV, all catalysts exhibited diffraction peaks at 10.5°, 18.1°, 26.3°, and 30.2°, which were assigned with the (110), (220), (222), and (400) crystal planes of cubic crystal CsPAV (JCPDS card number 46-0418). The results indicate that the addition of Cs during the calcination process facilitated the formation of a cubic crystal system favorable to the reaction [40]. Compared with NPAV and CPAV, BPAV exhibited a reduced diffraction peak intensity at 26.3°, which was attributed to the hydrogen bonding effects of ILs, leading to reduced crystallinity of the catalyst. The crystal size (p) and cubic lattice parameters (α) were calculated using the Scherrer equation on the (222) crystal plane (Table S2). The BPAV catalyst exhibited the smallest α and p values, indicating that the interaction between BMIM+ and PAV- notably influenced the crystal phase structure of BPAV following the incorporation of ILs with CsCuPAV. During the calcination process, ILs decomposed to form NH4 +, which disrupted the original structure, resulting in intensified interlayer cation exchange and a decrease in the d-spacing [29,41]. Moreover, the hydrogen bonding effects of ILs created oxygen vacancies in the polyoxometalate anions of the BPAV catalyst, promoting an optimal cation exchange balance. Therefore, the BPAV catalyst demonstrated the lowest lattice parameters and grain size (Table S2) [42]. Fig. 1b presents the FT-IR analysis results for all catalysts. Characteristic peaks representative of the Keggin structure were observed in all catalysts, corresponding to the stretching vibrations of P = O (1078 cm−1), Mo=Od (966 cm−1), Mo-Ob-Mo (890 cm−1), and Mo-Oc-Mo (793 cm−1). Additionally, characteristic bands of vanadium oxide (VOx) were detected in the BPAV, NPAV, and CPAV samples (Fig. S2), which were attributed to the secondary structure of the polyoxometalate. These findings suggest that during the calcination process, V atoms migrated from the original Keggin anionic structure [43–45]. The absorption band of the BPAV catalyst at 595 cm−1 was attributed to the presence of MoO3 [46]. The absorption band of BPAV at 1415 cm−1 corresponded to the N-H vibration of the NH4 + part, indicating that during the calcination process, the decomposition of the imidazole ring yielded NH4 +, maintaining the charge balance of the POM-IL hybrid. Compared with other catalysts, the IR spectrum of terminal Mo=Od in BPAV showed a red shift (Fig. S2), which was attributed to the hydrogen bonding effects between the Keggin anion and ILs. Raman spectroscopy was employed to investigate changes in the structure of polyoxometalates, as shown in Fig. 1c. The band of the BPAV catalyst at 246 cm−1 was assigned to the deformation vibration of the Keggin structure [47]. The broad band at 615 cm−1 corresponded to the symmetric stretching vibration of Mo-Oc-Mo [48]. The bands in the 880 cm−1 region were attributed to the stretching vibration of Mo-Ob-Mo [49]. The stretching vibration of Mo=Od was associated with the band at 990 cm−1 [50]. The shoulder peak at 290 cm−1 and the absorption band at 770 cm−1 in the BPAV catalyst originated from the V-O vibration in the secondary structure of the catalyst and the M-O vibration in the defective Keggin structure. This suggested that V atoms migrated from the primary structure of the Keggin structure to form defective polyoxometalate anionic structures. Compared with other catalysts, the intensity of the terminal Mo=Od peak in BPAV was reduced, which was attributed to the hydrogen bonding effects of ILs during the calcination process, thereby reducing the structural stability of the polyoxometalate anion and resulting in the formation of oxygen vacancies [51]. Fig. 1d depicts the thermogravimetric behavior of the catalysts. In the TG curve of BPAV, the weight loss of approximately 1.86 wt% below 160 °C was ascribed to the desorption of physically adsorbed water. The weight loss from 160 °C to 450 °C was 9.84 wt%, corresponding to the gradual decomposition of ILs, which was consistent with the theoretical IL content in BPAV (11 wt%), suggesting that most ILs were decomposed during the calcination process. Thermogravimetric information for other catalysts can be found in the supporting documents (Figs. S3–5). Figure S6 presents the SEM images of the catalysts. As shown in Figs. S6a and S6b , both organic and inorganic ammonium ions effectively promoted the formation of spherical morphologies in the catalysts. Notably, ammonium ions derived from ionic liquids facilitated the development of uniform spherical nanoparticles. In contrast, catalysts without ammonium ions exhibited irregular block structures (Figs. S6c and S6d). Fig. 1e shows the N2 adsorption/desorption curves of the catalysts, all of which demonstrate the irreversible N2 adsorption characteristic of type IV mesoporous isotherms. The specific surface area of BPAV was measured to be 9.79 m2/g, significantly higher than that of HPAV at 5.52 m2/g and exhibits a typical H3-type hysteresis loop (Table S3). This indicates that NH4 + and Cs+ produced by the thermolysis of ILs contributed to the increase in the catalyst's specific surface area. This is primarily because NH4 + and Cs+ substituted H+ on the surface of the catalyst, and their larger ionic radius led to an increase in the specific surface area [52]. Compared to NPAV (14.67 m2/g), the specific surface area of BPAV was reduced, which was attributed to the hydrogen bonding effects of ILs, resulting in the decomposition of some polyoxometalate anions. Additionally, compared to other catalysts, BPAV exhibited the smallest particle size (10.46 nm). UV-Vis spectra of all catalysts are displayed in Fig. 1f. The UV absorption peaks in the 300–400 nm range for all samples are attributed to the ligand-metal charge transfer region of the Keggin structure in polyoxometalates. The reduced intensity of the typical Keggin structure absorption peaks in the BPAV samples was due to the formation of oxygen vacancies within the polyoxometalate anions. Compared to other catalysts, BPAV shows a blue shift in the spectra at 500–600 nm, indicating significant interactions between the active component VO2+ and the polyoxometalate anions. The efficient electron transfer rate within the Keggin structure further enhances the redox performance of the catalysts. The d-d transitions of metal ions in the 600–800 nm range for BPAV suggest the reduction of ligand atoms within the polyoxometalate anions. Changes in the electronic structure confirm that the introduction of ILs through hydrogen bonding effects reduced the structural stability of the polyoxometalate anions, leading to the formation of oxygen vacancies. This process was accompanied by the migration of active VO2+ species to secondary structures, consistent with the previously mentioned Raman and FT-IR spectroscopy results. NH3-TPD analysis was employed to assess the acidity of the catalysts ( Fig. 2a). The results revealed that the BPAV catalyst exhibited both weak acid sites (100–200 °C) and moderate acid sites (400–500 °C), with the amount of moderate acid sites reaching 1.794 mmol/g, significantly higher than that of the CPAV and HPAV catalysts. This indicates that the NH4 + ions produced during the pyrolysis of ILs partially replaced H⁺, which likely reduced the charge density of the oxygen atoms in the polyoxometalate anion structure. The reduction in charge density improved the proton mobility at the terminal oxygen (Mo=Od), thereby enhancing the acidity of BPAV [53–55]. Additionally, ammonium ions were present in both NPAV and BPAV, but BPAV exhibits slightly higher acidity than NPAV. This further indicates that the synergistic interaction between the hydrogen bonding of ionic liquids with POM anions and the NH4 + ions generated during pyrolysis plays a crucial role in enhancing the acidity of BPAV. H2-TPR was employed to evaluate the redox ability of the catalysts (Fig. 2 b). The reduction peak for vanadium species could not be observed because of their low content. The reduction peak in the range of 575–650 °C corresponded to the decomposition of polyoxometalate anions and the formation of MoO3. The highest reduction peak of BPAV (578 °C) occurred at a lower temperature compared to other catalysts, suggesting that it was more easily reduced, which demonstrates that the introduction of ILs enhances the redox ability of BPAV [56,57]. O2-TPD analysis was conducted to evaluate the oxidative performance of the catalysts (Fig. 2c), with peaks below 300 °C ascribed to the desorption of surface-adsorbed oxygen, and peaks between 300 and 600 °C representing the release of lattice oxygen. BPAV possessed the highest amount of lattice oxygen (2.211 mmol/g), indicating that its lattice oxygen was more easily activated, contributing to enhanced surface oxygen replenishment ability [58]. Furthermore, BPAV displayed the highest peak for adsorbed oxygen (0.693 mmol/g), indicating that its lattice oxygen exhibited high mobility. These characteristics allowed BPAV to adsorb a large amount of gaseous oxygen on its surface, facilitating the rapid replenishment of lattice oxygen [59,60]. The presence of oxygen vacancies in the catalysts was investigated using EPR characterization (Fig. 2d). All catalysts exhibited EPR signals associated with oxygen vacancies at g= 2.003 [61]. The BPAV catalyst demonstrated significantly higher peak intensity compared to other catalysts, indicating that hydrogen bonding interactions within the ionic liquids (ILs) effectively promoted the formation of oxygen vacancies in the catalysts. XPS analysis was performed to determine the valence states and composition of elements near the surface of the catalysts. The XPS spectra of O 1s, V 2p, Mo 3d, and Cu 2p are presented in Fig. 2e, f, Fig. S8 and Fig S9, respectively. The variation in the relative molar atomic ratio of V/P (Table S4) suggests the rearrangement of V on the catalyst surface. Compared to other catalysts, BPAV exhibits the highest V/P ratio of 2.97, indicating that during the calcination process, the hydrogen bonding effects between ILs and polyoxometalate anions facilitated the transfer of V atoms from the bulk to the surface [52]. Fig. S8 demonstrates that the Mo species in the BPAV catalyst remained stable after calcination, suggesting that the introduction of ILs has little effect on the chemical state of Mo. Regarding vanadium ions, XPS analysis (Fig. 2d) reveals binding energy peaks at 516.2 eV and 517.2 eV, attributed to V4+ and V5+ species, respectively [30,62]. Among all the catalysts studied, BPAV demonstrates the lowest V5+/ V4+ atomic molar ratio, measured at 0.69 (Table S5), suggesting that ammonium ions derived from ionic liquids enhance the self-reduction ability of BPAV. This behavior likely results from hydrogen bonding between ionic liquids and POM anions, destabilizing the Keggin structure. Consequently, V species are more prone to migrating from primary to secondary structures during calcination [63,64]. Additionally, terminal oxygen (Mo=Od) bonds tend to cleave during calcination [7], with the released lattice oxygen oxidizing into O₂ molecules. This facilitates the reduction of V5+ to VO₂⁺ (VOx → VO2 + + O) and generates oxygen vacancies at lattice oxygen escape sites [15,52,65]. VO₂⁺ are widely acknowledged as the key redox-active center in BPAV catalysts [29], sees an increase in its abundance, significantly enhancing the redox activity of the catalyst [62,63]. The O 1s peak's binding energies at 530.4 eV, 531.5 eV, and 532.6 eV are assigned to lattice oxygen (Olatt), oxygen vacancies (Ovaca), and adsorbed oxygen (Oabs), respectively. Compared to other catalysts (Table S5), BPAV exhibits the highest relative atomic molar ratio of Ovaca to Olatt, measured at 0.69 (Fig. 2c). This suggests that the hydrogen bonding effects of ILs facilitates the cleavage of terminal oxygen Mo=Od in the polyoxometalate anions, resulting in the release of lattice oxygen and the formation of additional oxygen vacancies. Concerning copper ions, XPS analysis (Fig. S9) identifies binding energy peaks near 932 eV and 953 eV for Cu 2p1/2 and Cu 2p3/2, alongside peaks at 933.1 eV and 931.5 eV corresponding to Cu+ and Cu2+ environments. Cu+ and Cu2+ coexist in all Cu-containing catalysts. Notably, the binding energies for Cu+ and Cu2+ in BPAV show a positive shift relative to NPAV and CPAV, implying that hydrogen bonding interactions between ionic liquids and POM anions enhance the electron transfer rate between Cu+ and Cu2+. This enhancement enables Cu2+ to attract electrons from the Keggin structure during the MAL oxidation process, thereby improving the oxidative capabilities of active centers and facilitating the conversion of MAL to MAA. Simultaneously, Cu+ contributes to reoxidation by donating electrons to the Keggin structure, ensuring that the reduced active centers are more readily reoxidized, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the catalytic cycle [56]. 3.2 Catalytic performance and mechanism studies 3.2.1 Performance studies To investigate the effect of temperature on the selective oxidation of MAL to MAA, BPAV and three other catalysts were employed to conduct the reaction at different temperatures. Fig. 3a and S10 illustrate that as the temperature increased from 280 °C to 310 °C, the conversion rate of MAL over the BPAV catalyst rose from 68.6 % to 82.9 %. The selectivity for MAA likewise increased from 52.2 % to 88.9 % with the rise in temperature, but declined to 64.9 % at 320 °C. The BPAV catalyst exhibited superior performance compared to other catalysts in both the conversion rate of MAL and the selectivity for MAA (Fig. 3a), demonstrating enhanced catalytic activity across different temperatures. The increase in MAL conversion rate with temperature can be attributed to the participation of more activated molecules in the reaction. However, beyond 310 °C, the generation of by-products intensified, resulting in a decrease in selectivity. The optimal reaction temperature for the BPAV catalyst was determined to be 310 °C, with a conversion rate of 82.9 % and a selectivity of 88.9 %. To investigate the roles of ionic liquids, copper, and vanadium in catalytic reactions, we employed a variable control method to prepare catalysts missing one of the above specific component. As shown in Table S7, compared to the BPAV catalyst, the catalyst (NH4 +)XCsH3-XPMo11VO40 lacking copper ions exhibited a significant decrease in both conversion rate and selectivity. This is likely because Cu2+/Cu+ ions can accelerate the electron transfer rate between the Keggin-type heteropolyacid anion structure, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity in the MAL reaction. Furthermore, the catalyst (NH4 +)XCu0.2CsH3-X-1.2PMo12O40 showed lower catalytic activity compared to other vanadium-containing catalysts. This indicates that the VO2+ species formed during the calcination process in vanadium-containing catalysts play a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity of the MAL reaction. Finally, Cu0.2CsH2.8PMo11VO40, compared to BPAV, showed a certain gap in both conversion rate and selectivity. This is likely due to the absence of ionic liquid modification, which leads to insufficient acidity and redox capacity of the catalyst, thereby affecting its catalytic performance. Fig. 3b demonstrates that the yield of MAA is positively correlated with the amount of acid sites, indicating that higher acidity of the catalyst is more favorable for MAA production, which aligns with previous research findings. The enhanced performance of the BPAV catalyst can be attributed to the following factors: (1) The hydrogen bonding effects of ILs reduces the structural stability of polyoxometalate anions, making the terminal oxygen Mo=Od more susceptible to breaking, thereby releasing lattice oxygen and forming oxygen vacancies, which enhances lattice oxygen replenishment ability and accelerates the reaction rate [66–68]; (2) The synergistic interaction between the hydrogen bonding of ionic liquids with POM anions and the NH4 + ions generated during pyrolysis plays a key role in enhancing the acidity of BPAV, thereby facilitating the adsorption of MAL and the desorption of MAA; (3) The introduction of ILs reduces V5+ and Cu2+ in the catalyst, generating active components VO2+ that facilitate the reaction. Additionally, copper accelerates electron transfer between active components, further enhancing the catalytic activity of BPAV. The long-term stability experiments of the BPAV catalysts were conducted at 310 °C. As shown in Fig. 3c, the catalytic activity of BPAV remained almost unchanged after 80 h of testing. This indicates that the BPAV catalyst has good stability. The used catalyst was characterized by XRD and FT-IR. Compared to the fresh catalyst, the used catalyst still retained the characteristic peaks of the polyoxometalate Keggin structure. A distinctive absorption peak associated with reduced molybdenum was observed at 624 cm−1 (Fig. S11), suggesting that the catalyst gradually decomposes during prolonged reaction and forms MoO3/MoO2 [61]. This finding is consistent with reports in the literature [67,68]. As shown in Fig. S12, the characteristic peaks of the Keggin structure of the heteropoly acids attenuated after long-term evaluation, but the Keggin structural units of catalysts were still retained intact [68]. We have included the turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) data for the catalyst in the supplementary information (Table S5). Specifically, using the formulas from references [69–71], we calculated that the catalyst exhibits a TON value of 40 and a TOF value of 20 h⁻¹ in the MAL oxidation reaction. To further evaluate the catalyst's performance, we compared the TON and TOF values obtained in this study with those of benchmark catalysts reported in the literature. The results indicate that the performance of this catalyst ranks among the top in the industry, demonstrating superior catalytic efficiency and activity. Fig. 3d summarize the performance of typical catalyst, showing that the catalytic performance of BPAV significantly outperforms that of typical catalysts previously employed in Methacrylic acid synthesis [3,7,15,36,29,52,53,64,71]. This suggests that the catalyst holds significant potential for the MAL selective oxidation to MAA reaction and could serve as a preferred catalyst for such processes. We conducted control experiments to evaluate the actual contribution of hydrogen bonding in the ionic liquid. Specifically, stoichiometric amounts of imidazole and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) were used as modifiers to replace the ionic liquid BmimHSO4. The preparation procedures for these control catalysts were identical to those of the primary experimental group, ensuring comparability of experimental conditions. The experimental results, provided in Table S6, indicate that using sulfuric acid as a modifier increased the MAL oxidation conversion rate of the catalyst to 89.5 %, while the corresponding MAA selectivity decreased to 20.5 %. This phenomenon may be attributed to the significant enhancement in catalyst acidity caused by sulfuric acid, which increases the adsorption capacity of the catalyst surface for both reactants and products, thereby facilitating side reactions and reducing the selectivity of the target product. In contrast, the catalyst modified with imidazole exhibited a modest improvement in MAA selectivity, achieving 59.6 %, though the MAL conversion rate remained at a lower level of 68.5 %. This result suggests that the imidazole ring may enhance the catalyst's surface characteristics through decomposition into organic amine species, thereby improving catalytic activity, although its impact on acidity enhancement is less pronounced compared to sulfuric acid. To further explore the enhancing effects of ionic liquids, we employed various types of ionic liquids as modifiers and systematically analyzed their relationship with catalytic performance, focusing on variations in cations and anions as well as the influence of alkyl chain length in the cation. First, we evaluated the influence of various anions on the selective oxidation performance of MAL. As depicted in Fig. 3f, the catalyst modified with 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride demonstrated the highest MAL conversion rate of 90.6 %, but its selectivity notably dropped to 20.9 %. This phenomenon is likely due to the chloride ion serving as a strong hydrogen bond acceptor, forming robust hydrogen bonds with the C-H bond in the imidazole ring [72], thereby increasing the probability of side reactions and decreasing the selectivity for the target product. Conversely, the catalyst modified with 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate achieved a conversion rate of 85.8 %, though its MAA selectivity was slightly lower than that of the catalyst modified with hydrogen sulfate. Additionally, catalysts modified with 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium nitrate and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate demonstrated relatively poor performance. These discrepancies may arise from differences in hydrogen bond strength between various anions and the imidazole ring, subsequently affecting the catalysts' acidity and redox properties. Regarding the cation, we selected hydrogen sulfate ionic liquids with different cations and alkyl chain lengths to investigate their impact on catalytic performance. As shown in Table S6, methyltrioctylammonium hydrogen sulfate demonstrated the best catalytic performance, achieving an MAL conversion rate of 74.2 % and an MAA selectivity of 76.9 %. Further analysis of the impact of alkyl chain length on catalytic performance (Fig. 3e) revealed a volcano-shaped trend in MAA selectivity with increasing chain length. The MAA selectivity peaked at 88.9 % when the alkyl chain length reached 4, but gradually decreased as the chain length exceeded 4. This phenomenon may be attributed to medium alkyl chains optimizing the catalyst's acidity and redox properties, while excessively long alkyl chains could induce overly strong acidity, thereby reducing catalytic activity. To further assess the differences in interfacial wettability among the synthesized catalysts (BPAV, HPAV, NPAV, CPAV). As depicted in Fig. S14, the ionic liquid-modified catalyst BPAV exhibited a contact angle of 25.7°, indicating strong hydrophilicity. By comparison, the contact angles of the non-ionic liquid-modified catalysts CPAV, NPAV, and HPAV were 32°, 28°, and 37.8°, respectively, underscoring BPAV's superior wettability. This phenomenon can likely be attributed to the hydrogen bond interactions between the hydrogen bond donors in the ionic liquid and the oxygen atoms on the catalyst surface, which modify the surface charge distribution, thereby enhancing its hydrophilicity [73]. The increased hydrophilicity of the catalyst surface promotes the adsorption of water molecules and the formation of hydrated protons (e.g., [H3O+]), which effectively activate MAL molecules and significantly enhance catalytic activity [19,74]. 3.2.2 Mechanistic analyses Fig. 4c illustrates the in situ IR spectroscopy of the catalysts. The bands at 1055 cm−1, 991 cm−1, 867 cm−1, and 814 cm−1 represent P-O stretching, Mo=Od stretching, Mo-Ob-Mo stretching, and Mo-Oc-Mo stretching, respectively. The peaks at 1021 cm−1 and 934 cm−1 specifically refer to the molecular vibrational features of MAL [15]. At reaction temperatures below 200 °C, the weak intensity of the terminal Mo=Od peak in the catalyst's Keggin-type structure indicates MAL adsorption on the terminal Mo=Od. This is attributed to the lower negative charge of the terminal Mo=Od, which facilitates acidic proton release and MAL adsorption. As the temperature increased, the intensity of the terminal Mo=Od peak gradually increased until stabilizing at 310 °C, while the MAL peak intensity gradually decreased. This suggests that increasing the temperature not only accelerates the reaction of MAL but also promotes the replenishment of terminal Mo=Od lattice oxygen in the catalyst. With extended reaction time, the infrared peaks of the terminal Mo=Od gradually red-shifted, likely due to the interaction between MAL and the terminal Mo=Od during the oxidation process. In conclusion, these observations indicate that the active site of the MAL oxidation reaction is located at the terminal Mo=Od [5]. Utilizing DFT calculations, we performed an in-depth analysis of the adsorption interactions between the catalyst and MAL [75]. Considering the structural attributes of the heteropolyacid catalysts, we utilized a simplified Keggin anion atomic group model to depict the CPAV catalyst. For the BPAV catalyst, we introduced oxygen vacancies by modifying the Keggin anion model through the removal of terminal oxygen atoms. According to the MAL reaction mechanism, we crafted the adsorption configurations for both catalysts, as illustrated in Fig. 4a and b. The C-O bond length resulting from MAL adsorption on the BPAV catalyst is 2.229 A, which is relatively longer than the bond length on the CPAV catalyst, measuring 2.214 A. Simultaneously, the bond angle for the BPAV catalyst is 129.999°, significantly smaller than the CPAV's angle of 157.498 °. These observations suggest that oxygen vacancies reduce the adsorption energy between the heteropolyacid anion and MAL. Consequently, MAL desorption on the BPAV catalyst is promoted, which not only reduces the risk of MAL over-oxidation but also boosts the selectivity for MAA. Fig. 4e and f demonstrate the PDOS of MAL in the s and p orbitals before activation by adsorption on BPAV. Fig. 4g further demonstrates PDOS of MAL in the s and p orbitals after adsorption. It is evident that the p-orbital projected state density of BPAV tends to move towards lower energy levels. This implies an interaction between the molecular orbitals of MAL and the d orbitals of BPAV. After energy level splitting, some antibonding orbitals have energies higher than the Fermi energy level, prompting electron transfer towards the surface of BPAV. Fig. 4h then demonstrates the PDOS on the surface of BPAV after MAL adsorption, where the p-orbitals of the oxygen atoms in BPAV and the p-orbitals of the carbon atoms in MAL show significant overlap below the Fermi energy level, with a high degree of matching orbital energies. This further confirms the formation of the chemical bond between BPAV and MAL, indicating strong chemisorption properties. Combined with the optimization model analysis of MAL adsorption on BPAV, it can be observed that the C-O bond forms on the surface of BPAV after MAL adsorption. As demonstrated in Fig. 5a and b, the generation of multiple products, including MAA, acetic acid (HAC), and COX species, was detected when the reaction temperature was increased to 310 °C. The characteristic absorption peak of CO2 showed a weaker signal at 2345 cm−1. Meanwhile, the characteristic absorption peaks of CO were significantly stronger at 2105 cm−1 and 1910 cm−1, suggesting that CO was the main by-product in the MAL oxidation process. The characteristic absorption peaks of acetic acid were weak at 1321 cm−1 (C-O bond) and 1855 cm−1 (CO bond). The characteristic absorption peaks of MAA were also weak at 1222 cm−1 (C-O bond), 1710 cm−1 (CO bond), 2700 cm−1 (OH bond), and 2998 cm−1 (C-H bond). These peaks confirm the presence of MAA and acetic acid. The characteristic absorption peaks of intermediate M2 were located at 3098 cm−1 (C-H bond) and 2802 cm−1 (O-H bond) [76]. The peak at 1145 cm−1 represents the C-O bond vibration of the M2 ester group, whereas the peak at 1721 cm−1 represents the CO bond vibration of the M2 ester group. The intensity of the CO peak of the M2 ester group is significantly higher than that of the C-O peak, indicating that the carbonyl carbon in the M2 ester group of the intermediate was linked to the oxygen atom in the terminal Mo=Od at the end of the catalyst through C-O bond. Based on the in situ IR spectroscopy analysis and related literature [5,15], the mechanism for the selective oxidation of MAL to MAA over the BPAV catalyst is proposed (Fig. 5d) and the whole reaction pathway in conjunction with DFT calculations (Fig. 5c) is explained. In an acidic environment, the carbonyl carbon atom of MAL first breaks and adsorbs onto the terminal Mo=Od of the heteropolyacid anion containing an oxygen vacancy, forming the M1 structure. In the TS1 stage, the C-H bond in the MAL molecule breaks, weakening the strength of the terminal Mo=Od, while the carbonyl carbon of MAL begins to undergo reconstruction. The Gibbs free energy required for this step is 68.85 kcal/mol. Subsequently, the broken hydrogen atom migrates to another position of the terminal Mo=Od, forming an O-H bond and contributing to the creation of the intermediate ester group M2. This transition has a Gibbs free energy of 66.88 kcal/mol, which is considered the rate-determining step of the reaction. Next, the oxygen atom in the terminal Mo=Od breaks and combines with hydrogen atoms to form the target product MAA. The Gibbs free energy requirement for this process is 24.97 kcal/mol. The oxygen vacancies further adsorb gaseous oxygen, leading to the breakage of the O-O bond in the oxygen molecule at the oxygen vacancies and replenishing of the oxygen atoms into the lattice, forming lattice oxygen. The Gibbs free energy of this step is 24.33 kcal/mol. After completing the above cycle, the catalyst returns to its pristine state M5. 4 Conclusion In this study, polyoxometalate-ionic liquid catalysts were successfully synthesized through ion exchange followed by calcination. The incorporation of ILs weakened the structural integrity of the polyoxometalate anions via hydrogen bonding, leading to the formation of abundant oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface. These vacancies provided ideal adsorption energy, effectively preventing the over-oxidation of MAL to COx. The synergistic interaction between the hydrogen bonding of ionic liquids with POM anions and the NH4 + ions generated during pyrolysis plays a key role in enhancing the acidity of BPAV. Under atmospheric pressure and at a reaction temperature of 310 °C, the developed catalyst exhibited exceptional performance, achieving an MAL conversion rate of 82.9 % and MAA selectivity of 88.9 %, while maintaining outstanding stability over 80 h of continuous operation. Moreover, in-situ infrared spectroscopy and PDOS analysis confirmed that the terminal Mo=Od site was the primary active site for MAL oxidation. Reaction pathway calculations indicated that the formation of an ester intermediate at Mo=Od is the rate-determining step. This work systematically explores the impact of hydrogen bonding in ionic liquids on the structure-performance relationship of polyoxometalate anions and further enhances our understanding of the mechanism behind the selective oxidation of methacrolein.

        "dc:description": "The selective oxidation of methacrolein (MAL) to methacrylic acid (MAA) is a key step in C4 oxidation for polymethyl methacrylate production, but the limited catalytic activity of polyoxometalates (POMs) hinders their industrial use. Here, we synthesized POM-IL hybrid catalysts via ion exchange and calcination. Ionic liquids disrupted the POM structure through hydrogen bonding, creating oxygen vacancies that optimized adsorption energy and prevented MAL over-oxidation to COx. The hydrogen bonding between ionic liquids and polyoxometalate anions, coupled with ammonium ions derived from ionic liquids, generated a synergistic effect that markedly improves the acidity and redox properties of the catalyst. The catalyst achieved 82.9 % MAL conversion, 88.9 % MAA selectivity, and exceptional stability over 80 h. In-situ infrared spectroscopy and partial density of states (PDOS) analysis identified Mo=Od as the active site, with ester intermediate formation as the rate-determining step. This study uncovers the influence of hydrogen bonding in ionic liquids on the structure-activity relationship of polyoxometalate anions, offering crucial insights into the mechanism of methacrolein selective oxidation.",
