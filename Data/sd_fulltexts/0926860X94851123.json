COM (Received 13 December 1993; revised 21 February 1994; accepted 22 February 1994) Abstract As shown previously, an unsupported Fe-Mo sulfide catalyst is quite selective toward hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) relative to hydrodesulfurization (HDS). This paper is primarily concerned with the activity enhancement of that catalyst. It is shown that the HDN and HDS volumetric activities of the Fe-Mo catalyst can be significantly increased by promotion with nickel or cobalt. The increased activities are much higher than those observed with existing commercial catalysts. This was observed in tests with a petroleum distillate feed. The overall HDS kinetics are catalyst dependent; theoretical explanations for such a dependence are given. Keywords: Hydrotreating catalysts; Lumped kinetics; Pore diffusion in reaction mixtures; Promotion effects 1. Introduction In a previous paper [ 1 ] we described the preparation, characterization, and performance of a bulk (unsupported) catalyst system which gives an unusual combination of high hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) and low hydrodesulfurization (HDS) activities. The catalysts are bulk Fe-Mo and Fe-W sulfides prepared from a class of heterometallic metal sulfur complexes called metal amine thiomolybdates and thiotungstates. In these complexes the metals are molecularly associated with each other. The Fe-Mo sulfide bulk catalyst has also been found to be active for hydrogenating aromatics [ 2] . Moreover, results from accelerated aging have indicated that the catalyst is thermally stable [ 1 ] . The main purpose of this paper was to show how the HDN and HDS activities of the bulk Fe-Mo sulfide can be enhanced through the addition of a co-promoter *Corresponding author.

Ho et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994)127-139 such as nickel or cobalt. The results indicate that the present catalyst system offers a greater control of catalyst activity and selectivity than conventional catalyst preparation chemistry. In the course of this work, we found also that the kinetics for sulfur removal are catalyst dependent; a theoretical basis for such a dependence is provided. This is based on theory of continuous reaction mixtures with and without pore diffusion limitation. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation The synthesis of the catalyst precursors used in this study has been detailed in ref. [ 3 ] . The Fe-Mo bulk sulfide described in [ 1 ] was prepared from thermal decomposition of iron bis(diethylenetriamine) thiomolybdate in H2S/H2 at 325. It is straightforward to extend this binary system to a doubly promoted ternary system; e.g., precursors of the form MxM', -.(amine) 6,nMoyW, _yS4, where M and M' are different bivalent metal promoters, 0 sx, y <_ 1, and n the total number of nitrogen atoms in the amine chelating ligand. Prior to decomposition, the precursor compounds were pressed into pellets and sized to 20-40 mesh granules to ensure adequate particle-to-reactor diameter ratios in the activity tests. The metal sulfide catalysts used in the present study were obtained by decomposition of the precursors with a 10% hydrogen sulfide in hydrogen gas mixture at 325 and atmospheric pressure for three hours. After this treatment the bulk metal sulfides generally contain small amounts of carbon and nitrogen. Note that the preparation does not involve calcination in air. Using ethylenediamine (en) as the chelating ligand, we prepared the following precursor compounds: Fe (en) 3MOS4, Co (en) 3MOS4, Ni (en) 3MOS4, Feo.sCOo.s(en)3MOS4, Feo.sNio.s(en)3MOS4, FeMNio.3(en)3MOS4, and Feo.7COO.3 (en) 3MOS4. Two commercial catalysts, designated here and in ref. [ 1 ] as A and B, were tested to provide a set of base cases. The composition (wt.-% ), BET surface area, and pore volume of these catalysts are: Catalyst A, 12.5% Mo03, 3.5% CoO, 285 m2/g, and 0.52 cm3/g; Catalyst B, 18.0% Mo03, 3.5% NiO, 180 m2/g, and 0.5 cm 3/g. These y-A1203-supported catalysts were presulfided at 360 and ambient pressure for one hour with a 10% H2S-in-H2 gas mixture. 2.2. Catalyst characterization The precursor compounds upon thermal decomposition have specific BET (with N2) surface areas typically in the range of 5 to 15 M2/ g. The following observations exemplify the main differences in pore structure between the bulk metal sulfides and commercial catalysts. Catalyst A has a sharp unimodal pore-size distribution T C. Ho et al. l Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994)127-139 129 with a mean pore diameter of about 60 A. Nearly all of its pore volume and surface area is contained in the pores of 20-100 A size. In contrast, the pores of the bulk 0 Feo.s-COO.s-MO catalyst are bidispersed, with peaks at about 40 and 25 000 A. Here the micropores are generated by the thermal decomposition of the organic chelating ligand, while the macropores are the result of pelletizing. The BET surface area of the fresh Feo.5-Coos-MO catalyst is about 6.5 M2/g. As discussed previously [ 1 ] , M6ssbauer characterization of fresh bulk Fe-Mo catalyst indicated that the catalyst appears to be composed of an iron analog of the COMoS phase found by Topstbe et al. [4]. Also, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for both fresh and spent Fe-Mo catalysts showed a poorly crystalline MOSZ superimposed with lines of pyrrhotite (Fe, _XS) [ 1 ] . The bulk sulfide catalysts used in this study were characterized by XRD. In all cases, the qualitative characteristics of the poorly crystalline MOSZ phase are similar to those observed with the bulk Fe-Mo catalyst. XRD patterns of spent Ni-Mo and CO-Mo catalysts indicated the presence of Ni3S2 and Co9S$ phases, respectively. Similarly, in the spent Feo.5-COO.s-MO and FeO_5-NiO.5-Mo catalysts, Fe4,5C04_SSg and Fe4.5Ni4.5Sg (that is, the pentlandite phase) were observed, respectively. The pentlandite phase is known to be isostructural with Co9Sg and exists over a wide composition range in the Co-Fe-Ni-S phase diagram [ 5,6] . No attempts were made to identify phases not seen by XRD. 2.3. Catalyst evaluation The feedstock used was a light catalytic cycle oil containing 1.5 wt.-% total sulfur and 370 wppm total nitrogen (designated as feedstock A in ref. [ 1 ] ). The aromatic sulfur compounds are almost exclusively of the benzo- and dibenzothiophene types. Dibenzothiophenes with a sterically hindered sulfur atom are very refractory (ref. [ 7 ] and references therein). The most refractory ones are 4,6dimethy1dibenzothiophene and its derivatives because the sulfur atom is doubly hindered [ 7 ] . About 70% of the nitrogen compounds are carbazoles and the other 30% are spread evenly between indoles and quinolines. The activity tests were conducted in an automated trickle-bed unit consisting of four independent reactors in a common sand bath [ 1 ] . Each reactor was loaded with 20 cm3 catalyst. The conditions used were 3.25 MPa hydrogen pressure, 325, 1.5-6 h-' liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV), and 3000 SCF/B (standard cubic feet/barrel) hydrogen treat gas rate. Each catalyst was run for about 200 h. It took about 60-80 h for the catalysts to attain their steady-state activities. The liquid products were analyzed for total sulfur by X-ray fluorescence using the Princeton Gamma-Tech Analyzer (Model 100) and for total nitrogen by combustion/chemiluminescence using the Antek analyzer. 130 3. Results T. C. Ho et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994)127-139 The observed HDS and HDN kinetics are the sums of a huge number of individual HDS and HDN reactions of widely different rates. In situations like this, considerable theoretical work has been done to justify the use of power law model for the overall, lumped kinetics [ 8-13 ] . In what follows we use the rate constants of power law kinetics as measures of catalyst HDS and HDN volumetric activities. HDN was found to be adequately represented by first-order kinetics with rate constant KN (The kinetics treatment has been detailed in refs. [ 1,2] ). For sulfur removal, however, we found that the overall reaction order is catalyst dependent. The active ones were best described by 1.5th order with rate constant KS', while the less active ones followed second order with rate constant KS. This observation deserves further discussion, and we shall return to this point later. Examples of the kinetic plots are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. It should be emphasized that the lumped power-law rate constants represent the catalysts' volumetric activity.

As mentioned earlier, the surface area of conventional catalysts is greater than those of the bulk sulfide catalysts by at least an order of magnitude. In this connection, it is relevant to point out that due to the anisotropic character of MOS2 crystallites, there is no correlation between surface area and catalyst activity [ 14 ] . The selectivity of the catalysts for HDN relative to HDS is defined as the ratio of the rate constant of HDN to that of HDS; that is, SN=KN/Ks and SN' -KN/KS'. The KN, KS, KS', SN and SN' values for all the bulk sulfide catalysts evaluated are compiled in Tables 1 and 2. Table 1 contains results for catalysts whose HDS rates are best described by second order kinetics, whereas Table 2 contains those catalysts whose HDS rates are best described by 1.5th order kinetics. Also listed in the tables are the correlation coefficients (r) of the fit. Notice in Table 2 that the HDS data for catalyst A were fitted by 1.5th order to obtain a consistent basis for comparison, even though second order kinetics gave a better fit, Table 1. As can be seen from Table 2, the 1.5 order fit for catalyst A, on a relative basis, is reasonably good. This approach does not affect in any way the relative activity ranking among the bulk sulfide catalysts listed in Table 2, but provides a more conservative comparison between the commercial and the bulk sulfide catalysts. 132 TC Ho et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994)127-139 4. Discussion 4.1. Synergistic effects The results shown in Tables 1 and 2 indicate that metal composition is a primary variable for controlling the selectivity and activity of the bulk metal sulfides for heteroatom removal. The HDN and HDS activities of the Fe-Mo catalyst can be greatly enhanced by copromotion with cobalt or nickel. As shown in Fig. 3, the Fe, _x-Nix Mo and Fe, _x-Cox Mo systems both appear to have a maximum HDN activity at about x=0.5, at which copromotion produces a synergy. Note that in Fig. 3 the volumetric activities are normalized with respect to that of catalyst B. Of the bulk catalysts evaluated, the best HDS catalyst is Feo.S-Coos-Mo sulfide which showed roughly a two-fold advantage over the conventional HDS catalyst (catalyst A). In contrast, the best HDN catalyst, Feo.5-N'0.5Mo sulfide, showed about a six fold advantage over the conventional HDN catalyst (catalyst B). These results support our earlier assertion [ 1 ] that there exists significant room for improving the HDN level attained by current commercial catalysts. 6 M=Ni 5 4 4 M=Co z 0 m a~ 3 as 2 1 Fe1.x Mx Mo 0.2 0.6 1.0 Fe -Mo x M-Mo Fig. 3.

Ho et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994)127-139 133 The bulk catalysts, regardless of their compositions, all give higher HDN-toHDS ratios than commercial catalysts. Note that Feo.5-Nia.5-MO is more HDNselective than Fe-Mo and Ni-Mo and that Feo.S-Coos-Mo is more HDN-selective than Co-Mo. In this regard, some conjectures regarding the characteristics of the active sites on these catalysts seem to be in order. As discussed previously [ 1,2], the activation energy for HDN on the Fe-Mo catalyst is higher than that on commercial catalysts. This suggests that the Fe-Mo catalyst probably provides more sites where nitrogen heterocycles can be preferentially adsorbed and/or hydrogenated. The low HDN selectivity of the commercial catalysts may be partially attributed to the presence of the A1203 support. It has been well recognized that HDN involves two consecutive steps: hydrogenation followed by hydrogenolysis. In HDN of many basic nitrogen compounds (e.g. quinolines) over conventional catalysts, the weight of evidence suggests that hydrogenolysis appears to be the rate-limiting step under most commercial conditions. As for multiring nonbasic nitrogen compounds (e.g. carbazoles), indications are that the rate of hydrogenation can be much slower than that of hydrogenolysis [ 15 ] . One may further speculate that the bulk sulfides and commercial catalysts probably have more or less the same ability for the adsorption and hydrogenation of basic nitrogen heterocycles. What makes the bulk catalysts more selective for HDN might be the catalysts' stronger affinity for nonbasic nitrogen heterocycles. Further work addressing this fundamental issues is needed. 4.2. Shift of overall HDS order Here we present two possible explanations for the observed shift in HDS overall reaction order. The treatment invokes two basic assumptions. One is that the number of sulfur species is so large that the reaction mixture can be treated as a continuum [ 8 ] . Another is that HDS of individual sulfur species can be described by pseudofirst-order kinetics (ref. [ 7 ] and references therein). We first consider the case where the reactions are not limited by pore diffusion. Overall kinetics with no diffusion limitation Using the individual HDS rate constants as the label for the desulfurizing species, we can write the concentration of each sulfur species in an isothermal plug flow reactor as c(k,t) -c(k,0)exp( -kt) (1) Here t is the space time and c(k,0)dk is the concentration of species with rate constant between k and k+dk. The total sulfur concentration Qt) can then be calculated as C(t) -fc ( k, 0)e-k`dk (2) 0 134 T C. Ho et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994)127-139 Now consider a class of feedstocks whose c(k,0) can be described by the gamma distribution [ 8 ] (hereafter called gamma feeds) c(k,0) = yY(klK)Y-'e _'r*'K/r(y) y> O (3) where r is the gamma function. With only two parameters, this function can portray a wide variety of shapes. As Fig. 4 shows for the case K=1, y=1 corresponds to an exponential distribution, implying that the feed has a non-zero amount of virtually unreactive species. When y> 1, the distribution is monomodal. A large y means not only an easy but also a relatively homogeneous feed (a sharper peak). In fact, in the limit y---> oo, the feed has only one component. A linear combination of two gamma distributions gives a bimodal distribution. Substituting Eq. (3) into Eq. (2) and integrating Eq. (2) gives Qt) =(1+Ktly)-Y (4) This implies that the overall kinetics is power law dC= ' KC (5) at where the overall order m has a physical meaning. It is related to the feed property y by m=1 + 1 /y > 1 for finite y (6) This says that a large collection of first-order reactions behaves likes a single species with a higher-than-first-order kinetics, a result first obtained by Aris [ 8 ] . This is 1.0 o -Y 6 -Y _ 2 w 0.5 V = 1 0.0 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 k Fig. 4. Gamma distributions (K=1) for different y values. T.C Ho et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994) 127-139 135 hardly surprising; as time progresses the reactive sulfur species desulfurize rapidly and the mixture becomes progressively more refractory, thus giving rise to a higher overall order. As discussed in refs. [ 9-11 ] , the overall order m can be viewed as reflecting the activity of the catalyst for attacking the nearly unconvertible species present in the feed: the higher the activity, the lower the overall kinetic order. Based on the above, the observed shift of overall HDS order may be interpreted as follows. Under the conditions used, the Fe-Mo catalyst is not active enough to desulfurize some of the refractory sulfur species (e.g., sterically hindered sulfur heteroatoms), thus giving rise to an overall order of two (y=1). The incorporation of nickel or cobalt as co-promoter enhances the ability of the catalyst to attack the refractory sulfur species, which in turn lowers the overall reaction order to 1.5, corresponding to y=2. Incidentally, we note that if one insists that the overall order is unity (consistent with the order of the underlying kinetics), then the overall rate `constant' must be a decreasing function of time to reflect the slowdown of the overall rate. One can write the overall kinetics as dC= - Ka(t)C (7) at with a(t) -C(t) \"y (g) From Eq. (4), a (t) for feeds of the gamma type has the form a(t) _ 1 (1+Ktly) (9) Obviously, a goes to zero as t-* -. It may be interesting to note that in the case of coupled bimolecular reactions, the time-dependent overall rate `constant' approaches a non-zero constant as t--~, oo [ 16]. Asymptotic kinetics with no diffusion limitation The above treatment is restricted to gamma feeds [ Eq. (3) ] . For an arbitrary feed, the overall HDS kinetics can be developed asymptotically at high HDS levels. In this regard, we remark that under the recent U.S. Clean Air Act, the sulfur specification in diesel oils has been lowered from 0.2-0.3 wt.-% to 0.05 wt.-%. In catalyst exploratory and development studies, HDS data are necessarily gathered at high HDS levels. It is thus useful (e.g., for catalyst ranking purposes) to know the kinetics in this regime. In the case of first-order reactions, the behavior of C at large times is governed by the most refractory species (small k), as might be expected intuitively. This leads to the following treatment due to Ho and Aris [91. Let c(k,0)=k''-'(co+ c,k+ ), y>Oandco00 (10) 136 T C. Ho et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994)127-139 When y=1, the feed contains a finite amount of virtually unreactive organosulfur species. Performing the term-by-term integration, one obtains C(t) t J'co+cj t+...)v''-le-dv \\0 _ F(Y) y) c0 + O (t y 1J as t---+ bgoo (11) Retaining only the leading order term, one obtains the following long time, asymptotic power law kinetics dC _ y C, (12) dt [ r(y) CO] \"'' where the asymptotic reaction order m' again takes the form m'=1+1/y (13) Also the overall asymptotic rate constant depends on y and co. As with the previous case, a more active catalyst gives a lower overall order. We next discuss another possible reason for the shift in the overall reaction order. Asymptotic kinetics with pore diffusion When a single species undergoes an nth-order reaction, it is well known that severe pore diffusion limitation causes a shift in the reaction order - from n to (n+ 1) /2. The only exception is when the reaction is first order, for which the order remains unchanged. One may wonder if this means that the overall order of a continuum of first-order reactions remains intact when all reactions are severely diffusion limited. This is the question we address here. For simplicity, we assume all reactants have the same diffusivity. In the presence of pore diffusion limitation, the concentration of the individual species in the bulk fluid phase is c(k,t) =c(k,0)exp[ -krl(k)t] (14) where rl(k) is the effectiveness factor associated with species k. When the diffusion limitation is severe, rl approaches the reciprocal of the Thiele modulus 0; that is, 1 1 il(k) \"'=L(klD)1/2 (15) in which D is the diffusivity and L the characteristic size (i.e., volume to surface ratio) of the catalyst particles. The total concentration is the integral of all reactant concentrations in the fluid phase; that is, T.C Ho et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994)127-139 137 C(t) - J C(k,0)e -(`2/LlktIztdk (16) 0 Let (DO 1/2 L --_a (17) Then, the above integral in terms of the new variable a takes the form 2t C(t)- 2D Jc(u,0)ue-\"`du (18) 0 and Eq.

Eq. (23) essentially is the same relationship for the single-reactant case. Hence, as far as reaction order is concerned, the mixture at high HDS under strong diffusion limitation can be treated as if it were a single reactant. The foregoing treatment shows that pore diffusion can indeed cause a shift in the overall order of a continuum of first order reactions. However, it seems unlikely that the shift in HDS order observed in this study results mainly from pore diffusion 138 T C. Ho et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994)127-139 limitation. If all the individual HDS were severely diffusion limited, then it is likely the overall HDN order should also show some degree of catalyst dependence. Moreover, a rough calculation using the Weisz and Prater criterion [ 17 ] for the Feo.5-Coos-Mo catalyst indicated that significant pore diffusion limitation is unlikely, as shown below. The Weisz and Prater criterion for the absence of significant pore diffusion limitation takes the form z <c 1 (24) where CS is the reactant concentration at the catalyst surface and R the radius of catalyst particles. The effective diffusivity D was estimated from binary diffusion coefficient D'; the latter was estimated using the Wilke-Change correlation [ 18 J . For dibenzothiophene in the feed, D = 1.4 - 10 - 5 cm2/s for liquid filled pores. The observed HDS rate (rP) on the Feo.5-Coos-MO catalyst was estimated to be about 4.5 - 10-g mol/s . cmI catalyst with Cs =4 - 10-5 mol/cm3. With these parameter values, the Weisz and Prater criterion is met. Admittedly, the above calculation is subject to some uncertainty. Should diffusion be the limiting step, it means that the relative intrinsic activities of the highly active bulk catalysts would be even greater than those shown in Tables 1 and 2. 5. Concluding remarks The results indicate that the present synthetically homologous class of catalysts show a strong effect of catalyst composition. These low surface area sulfides, to a varying degree, generally display higher selectivity for HDN than conventional catalysts. The HDN volumetric activity of the Fe-Mo sulfide catalyst can be significantly increased by copromotion with nickel or cobalt. The optimum composition appears to occur at a 1.0 iron-to-nickel or iron-to-cobalt atomic ratio. These doubly promoted molybdenum sulfides are more effective for HDN than their singly promoted counterparts. The basic idea behind our approach is that the formation of catalytically active phases can be facilitated by preparing molecular catalyst precursors in which molybdenum, promoter metal (s) , and sulfur are intimately mixed at the molecular level. This approach seems to offer a greater control of catalyst activity and selectivity than has been possible hitherto. Finally, we have presented a general analysis of how the overall, lumped kinetics are affected by catalyst activity (or feedstock properties) and pore diffusion. While pore diffusion does not change the apparent reaction order of a single first-order reaction, it does shift the overall order of the lumped kinetics of a bunch of firstorder reactions. This result does not appear to be intuitively obvious. T.C Ho et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994)127-139 139 References [ 1 ] T.C. Ho, A.J. Jacobson, R.R. Chianelli and C.R.F. Lund, J.

As shown previously, an unsupported Fe-Mo sulfide catalyst is quite selective toward hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) relative to hydrodesulfurization (HDS). This paper is primarily concerned with the activity enhancement of that catalyst. It is shown that the HDN and HDS volumetric activities of the Fe-Mo catalyst can be significantly increased by promotion with nickel or cobalt. The increased activities are much higher than those observed with existing commercial catalysts. This was observed in tests with a petroleum distillate feed. The overall HDS kinetics are catalyst dependent; theoretical explanations for such a dependence are given.
