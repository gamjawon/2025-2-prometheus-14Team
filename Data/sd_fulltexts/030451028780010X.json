Specific activities and selectivities vary in a limited range for n-hexane, whereas large variations are observed with 2,2,3,3-TMB and MCP. In all cases specific activities for hydrogenolysis increase with particle size. Some general rules appear for the influence of size on the splitting of the different bonds found in these alkanes: the cleavage of bonds involving only primary, secondary or tertiary carbon atoms is less sensitive to a change in particle size of the metal, since activities vary by less than a factor of ten The activation energy for these reactions is lower than that observed for the hydrogenolysis of bonds involving a quaternary carbon atom. The splitting of these bonds is highly sensitive to the metallic disper- sion, since specific activities can vary by four orders of magnitude between catalysts of high and low dispersion, for the splitting of biquaternary C C bonds. These different behaviours can be rationalized assuming different types of adsorption of the hydrocarbon depending on the size of the metallic particles and the substitution of the carbon atoms. Introduction The rate of C C bond splitting has been found to depend on surface structure on several metals [1-4] This type of reaction has been mainly investigated on platinum and indium in relation to reforming. Studies on films have shown that rhodium is one of the most active metals for hydro- genolysis, and differs from palladium in the sense that rhodium favours mainly terminal splitting, while palladium catalyses the rupture of internal *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed 0304-5102/87/$3 50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 94 bonds [3, 5] Previous work on the catalytic properties of Pd and Rh showed that particle size and support effects are much more important on Rh than on Pd [6-10]. The turnover frequency for the ring opening of methylcyclo- pentane or cyclopentane remains constant with dispersion on Pd/Al203, whereas a ten-fold change is observed on Rh/AlzG^ [10] In the case of Rh/SiOz, a maximum of activity was observed for particles around 30 A in size for the hydrogeno lysis of ethane [11] and methylcyclopentane [7,10]. This different behaviour between palladium and rhodium was attri- buted to a greater ability of supported rhodium particles to retain particular crystal habits, and therefore a given coordination of surface atoms, in the conditions of the reaction [7, 8]. These crystal habits depend on the nature of the support and on the size of the rhodium particles [9] The importance of the hydrocarbon structure is well known [4, 5, 12,13a, 13b] Depending on the nature and the dispersion of the metal, different intermediates have been proposed for hydrogenolysis, mainly 1-2C and 1-3C adsorbed species The former should prevail on N1, Co, Rh and Ru, and the latter on Pd and Pt, Ir being an intermediate case. However, 1-4C and 1-5C adsorbed species have also been proposed in the conversion of different hydrocarbons on platinum [13]. The aim of this work is to obtain a better descnption of the conversion of hydrocarbons on Rh catalysts Different model molecules were compared on a series of Rh catalysts which have been described earlier [6-10], in order to determine the relative importance of these different surface com- plexes in relation to the structure of the molecule and the metal particle size. Experimental Reactants Hydrogen of high purity grade (> 99.99%) was used for the catalytic experiments, and oxygen and hydrogen of ultra-high purity (>99.9995%) for adsorption measurements. These gases were purchased from Air Liquide. The hydrocarbons used were methylcyclopentane (MCP) from Carlo Erba (RPE grade), n-hexane (nH) and 2-methylpentane (2MP) from Merck, 3-methylpentane (3MP) from Fluka (punss. grade), 2,2-dimethylbutane (22DMB) and 2,2,3,3-tetramethylbutane (2233TMB) from Aldnch The rhodium precursors were RhCla^HaO from Merck and (Rh(NH3)5Cl)Cl2 from Ventron. Catalysts The catalysts were prepared following the method described by Brunelle [14] The supports used were two samples of 7-alumma from Rhone Poulenc of 202 m2 g~1 and 320 m2 g~1 To obtain well-dispersed catalysts, rhodium is introduced as Rhdy'SH^O by ion exchange in acidic medium (pH ~2), in contrast, large rhodium particles on alumina can be obtained by 95 impregnation of the support by the amine salt in aqueous solution. During the exchange procedure the contact time between the earner and the solu- tion was short and did not exceed half an hour After deposition of the desired salt, the catalysts were dried at 110 C overnight. To obtain very small rhodium particles, for samples Rh 11, CG F22 and CG F16, a calcination step is performed before reduction under the following conditions, calcination temperature 693 K, duration 2 h, heating rate 0 5 C mm\"1. Finally, samples were reduced under flowing Hz By changing the method of Rh deposition, the reduction temperature and the water partial pressure over the solid, the dispersion of the metallic phase can be varied over a wide range, as previously shown [15a] The residual water pressure, due to reduction of Rh203 particles, was modified by chang- ing the hydrogen flow rate and/or diluting hydrogen by nitrogen The dispersion of Rh was determined by H; or 0; chemisorption and H^-O; titration. The results were checked by transmission electron micros- copy In an extended study on Rh and Pd supported catalysts ranging from 1-1.5 nm to >10 nm in metal particle size, Fuentes and Figueras [15a] have shown previously that extrapolation to zero pressure of the 0; and Hz adsorption isotherms in the 0 -10 torr range, gives an adsorption stoichiom- etry for surface rhodium atoms, H/Rhg and 0/Rhg, close to unity. In all cases the agreement was excellent with transmission electron microscopy results At higher pressures, this stoichiometry will be generally greater than 1 [15b, 15c]. For all samples, with the exception of CG F22 and CG F16, the mean particle size determined by TEM is in good agreement with the results of adsorption measurements. TEM shows that CG F22 and CG F16 samples have a high dispersion (large number of particles of size <1 nm). In that case the stoichiometries of adsorption change, if oxygen gives 0/Rhg~l, hydro- gen adsorption and Hz-O; titration are excessively low and cannot be used practically for dispersion measurements [15b] These two samples may be called 'ultra-dispersed catalysts'. The main characteristic features of the catalysts are listed in Table 1. Activity measurements Catalytic activities were determined on an aliquot (50 -100 mg) of the sample used for chemisorption measurements. The sample was reactivated in situ under flowing Hz at 450 C overnight The rates were measured in a conventional flow reactor at low conversion in order to avoid heat and mass transfer limitations. Depending on the reactivity of the sample, reaction temperatures ranged from 433 - 533 K. Partial pressures of reactants were. nH = 44 torr, 2MP = 74 torr, 3MP = 60 torr, 22DMB = 120 torr; 2233TMB = 14 torr; MCP = 40 torr The composition of the effluent was determined by sampling on line to a gas chromatograph using a squalane column (6 m X 1/8 in, 80 -100 mesh). 96 TABLE 1 Characteristic features of the rhodium catalysts Cat; NarRh alysts ne84s1-d %lo1 Metal lading85 Red%H300 uction tr2 % N2-0 eatmfC<til (s >ntantact ine -1) .

The general trend shows a decrease in activity when the rhodium dispersion on alumina in- creases, but the magnitude of the effect depends on the hydrocarbon mole- cule. An enhancement of the structure sensitivity appears when the carbon atoms become more and more substituted The ratio of activities between 97 TABLE 2 Specific activities (h~1) in the conversion of various alkanes on Rh/Al^Oa at 493 K Catalyst nH 2MP 3MP 22DMB 2233TMB MCP Rh84 185 185 195 390 260 500 Rh 50 85 100 127 550 CGAF 110 110 140 75 39 420 Rh6A 75 46 80 50 76 Rh 11 38 42 35 58 13 30 CGF22 24 32 34 4 007 12 CGF16 25 20 10 5 5 the most and the least active samples goes from 6 for nH to 4 X 103 for 2233TMB The turnover frequencies for MCP conversion are m close agree- ment with the values reported earlier on similar catalysts [7], with the interesting exception of CG F22 and CG F16 samples, for which a sharp decrease in TOF appears We note finally that catalysts Rh 84, Rh 50 and CG AF prepared with different supports, rhodium salts, and different deposition procedures exhibit similar catalytic activities The only common point is that large Rh particles are present in the three samples Tables 3 to 8 present the selectivity patterns for the conversion of nH, 2MP, 3MP, 22DMB, 2233TMB and MCP respectively, as well as the fragmen- tation and the reactivity factors The former characterizes the depth of hydrogenolysis and represents the number of hydrocarbon fragments per molecule decomposed It was defmed following Paal and Tetenyi [16] as n-l c, ^~ \"y^c s \" c- In order to describe the pattern of hydrogenolysis for different bonds, we have used the reactivity factor CJ defined previously by Leclercq et al [13] actual rate of rupture o; = expected rate of rupture (random fission) The selectivity pattern in MCP conversion exhibits a close similarity with previous works [7, 10], and confirms the tendency for non-selective nng opening on the smaller Rh particles This behaviour is emphasized on the three well-dispersed catalysts. A point which can be noted is the con- stancy of 3MP selectivity, it seems that when the dispersion increases, nH is formed m higher amounts, mainly at the cost of 2MP Ring opening represents the main reaction during MCP conversion, however, deeper a e 2 2 ^ 4- -S c c a> S a fm as ' 04-a V o os ^1 uo w w ocCM r-l i-l 0 0 i-- 0 i 2U '<(' CO OS <S> r^ Ol CM i-4 0 0 i-l 0 . at M N M M SM CT M CM fe 6 CO N N CM 01 CSI ct M (M f-1 0 U3 CO t-( 0 ^f QQ ^ ao o <o <o ^y f~t0 (0 r-l 0 i 1 ' I 0 0 0 \"-1 r-< i-l r-l 1-* A oa IQ w N CM i-< i-i0000000 i.

However, when nH is converted first, the initial amount of CH4 is higher (Fig 1), but rapidly reaches a steady state value after a few minutes under feed. In the conversion of nH, it seems that the deactivation process is directly correlated to the excess amount of CH4 which corresponds to deep hydrogenolysis. For hydrocarbons containing primary-secondary (P S) and secondary- secondary (S S) bonds, such as nH and 2MP, the terminal splitting and the fragmentation factor decrease to the advantage of internal splitting when the dispersion increases. On Rh black, terminal splitting is largely favoured, since reactivity factors of P S bonds in nH and 2MP are respectively equal to 1 33 and 2.70 [5,17]. 101 30 -A- >< E 20 10 50 100 time ( mn ) Fig. I Activity and selectivity versus time for the conversion of n-hexane over CG F22 catalyst, relative activity (A), selectivities for Ci (n), Cy.

As for activity, the most important changes are observed for 2233TMB, since from a purely selective Q Q bond rupture on large particles the reaction changes to a noticeable P Q bond cleavage on small particles. The determinations of the activation energies for the cleavage of each bond were achieved from knowledge of the selectivity patterns and activities at different temperatures. The values were calculated from the amount of the larger fragment, and temperature was varied in both increasing and decreasing orders. The results are presented in Table 9.

A value of 53 kcal mol\"1 for neopentane conversion on Rh/silica has been reported by Boudart and Ptak [18b]. These values are not so far from the present ones for nH and 22DMB conversion For MCP conversion, the data are also in good agreement with previous work [7], and the sequence 3(8 T) > E^S S) > E^(S S'} is reporduced. The effect of particle size appears different depending on the nature of the bond and the hydrocarbon involved. General trends may be established: the activation of P S bonds increases with increasing dispersion of Rh, with the exception of 22DMB, while for S S bonds Eg, goes through a minimum value. Bonds involving a tertiary or quaternary carbon atom seem less affected by particle size changes, except for 2233TMB, for which P Q and Q Q are more activated on small Rh particles. For nH and 2MP conversions, we can see that, if a(P S) is greater than a(S S) on big clusters, the reverse is true on smaller ones. On the different molecules it becomes evident that bonds with qua- ternary carbon atoms are more activated, followed by bonds containing CT, then Cp, and finally Cg Cs are the easiest to cleave. To some extent an analogy exists between S S bonds in nH and MCP. similar values and a dependence of 3 upon Rh particle size. It is important to note the dif- ference of J?a o\" P S and S S bond cleavage between nH and 2MP. This observation may be rationalized by assuming that an increasing degree of ramification of the carbon atom in the (3-position of P S and S S bonds increases the activation energy for the rupture of these bonds Trace amounts of isomenzation compounds can be found. On the one hand, whatever the Rh particle size when nH, 22DMB or 2233TMB are processed, no isomenzation has been detected. On the other hand with 2MP and 3MP only a small MP interconversion occurs on large Rh particles, but 2MP, 3MP, nH and MCP are formed on well-dispersed catalysts. Keeping in mind that the selectivity of isomenzation never exceeds 3 - 5% and that isomenzation products are present as trace amounts in the starting reactants, only rough estimates of the activation energies can be obtained for isomen- zation. At first sight it seems that these activation energies ranged between 50 - 60 kcal mol\"1 on small Rh particles and between 30 - 40 kcal mol\"1 on the others. Discussion Three interesting features can be seen in the conversion of alkanes over rhodium catalysts. The first one is that skeletal rearrangement remains quite marginal, usually less than 5%, whatever the rhodium dispersion; the main products come from hydrocrackmg. The inability of rhodium to promote isomenzation may be understood in terms of metallocarbene chemistry. The metals which possess better capacities to form metallocarbenes are also the 104 best for C C hydrogenolysis, namely Ni>Rh>Ir>Pt [12]. This classi- fication parallels that suggested by the multiple exchange of methane for adsorbed methylene [19a, b]. In the hydrocracking of nH and 2MP on large Rh particles, the main product is a large excess of methane (1; >2), reflecting a simple cleavage into Ci + Cs. This behaviour clearly shows that several consecutive C C bond ruptures occur before desorption. Triple or multiple attachment to the surface may therefore be possible on rhodium, leading to complete degrada- tion to single-carbon species, which then desorbs as methane When the rhodium particle size decreases, this behaviour tends to disappear (^ ~2). The second feature is the very large variations in particle size sensitivity depending on the hydrocarbon which is reacted The third point is a slight, but significant, difference in hydrocarbon reactivity on a given catalyst. It must be emphasized that the different alkanes are not converted at the same partial pressure, and this has an influence on the rates In the conversion of ethane [20] or n-pentane [18a] over Rh/silica, a value of 0 8 -1 has been found for the order relative to the alkane, assuming that the same values hold in the present case, then at the same hydrocarbon pressure of 120 torr for instance, the TOF on Rh 84 will be 350 - 500 for the conversion ofnH, 2MP, 3MP and 22DMB, and 1200 -1500 for MCP and 2233TMB. A more accurate description of hydrogenolysis can be obtained by considering the specific reactivity of each bond in the different alkanes in relation with the possible surface complexes, rather than the reactant con- version as a whole. For this purpose Table 10 presents specific activities for each bond rupture at 493 K These values are obtained from the overall TOF (Table 2) and the percent of the larger fragment in each bond cleavage (Tables 3 - 8). Hydrogenolysis of the biquaternary C C bond The most salient point is the behaviour of the biquaternary C C bond in 2233TMB, which exhibits high reactivity on large Rh particles, then falls sharply when the dispersion increases In this case the change in activity exceeds 104, which is probably one of the largest structure effects observed. It is generally admitted that the rupture of a C C bond requires at least two carbon atoms attached at the surface during the catalytic act Then rupture of the Q Q bond most likely involves 1-4C diadsorbed species Such an intermediate is rather uncommon, but has been previously proposed by Leclercq and Maurel [13a] for the hydrogenolysis of 2233TMB on Pt/Al^Oa, and by Weisang et al [21, 22] for the isomenzation of methylpentanes over Ir/Al^Oa The latter authors propose that a diadsorbed carbene complex occurs, then progresses to isomer products in a concerted mechanism via a 'quasi-cycio butane' nng. Another possibhty is the formation of a metal- lacyclopentane by 1-4C dialkyladsorption at one Rh atom, which is known to occur in organometallic reactions with Pt [23] and N1 [24] With nickel- acyclopentane, the C C bond rupture leading to ethane readily occurs when the coordination of N1 is high An analogy may be found between N1 and 106 Rh, which often exhibit similar behaviour; here the Q Q bond rupture is very marked on large Rh particles, on which the coordination number is high Finlayson et al. [25] propose a similar 1-5C dialkyi complex linked at one Rh site in order to explain the selective cyclic mechanism in 1-5 dehydrocychzation of 2,2,4,4-tetramethylpentane It should be pointed out, however, that the selectivity for cyclization was very low in experiments on Rh films as for our supported Rh catalysts. Moreover both isomenzation and cyclization of methylpentanes which could proceed by this mechanism are marginal reactions on rhodium at the temperature used here. It is then doubtful that such a complex, attached at a single rhodium site, has a real significance in Q Q bond hydrogenolysis. Thus the very high sensitivity to Rh particle size (>104) suggests a site of large size [26]. Moreover, it is well known that Rh favours multiple H/D exchange with alkanes [27], and a highly dehydrogenated intermediate could then be considered. Therefore, for the cleavage of the Q Q bond we favour a 1-4C complex multiply bonded to the metal, requiring an ensemble of a large size (Scheme 1) An analogous intermediate may be found in the hydrogenolysis of 1,2-dimethylcyclobutane on Rh film [28], which leads to 2,3-dimethylbutane via a 1-2C dimetallocarbene. It should be emphasized that in no case has isomenzation of 2233TMB been detected Splitting of secondary-quaternary and primary-quaternary C C bonds The Q Q bond rupture is very sensitive to Rh particle size In contrast, splitting of the S Q bond in 22DMB or the S T bond in 3MP is less depen- dent on this factor and remains reactive on small particles It seems likely that 1-4C complexes described above (Scheme 1) do not operate in 22DMB conversion This enables us to postulate a 1-3C complex for the rupture of P- Q and S Q bonds in 2233TMB and 22DMB, as similar magnitudes of the particle size dependence can be found for these bonds. It is more difficult to define whether the nature of that complex is single site [29] or multisite c-^ III C II ^-C M III II * * Scheme 1 Hydrogenolysis of 2233TMB 107 [30], and no mformation can be obtained from isomenzation, which does not occur with 22DMB or 2233TMB Thus if structure sensitivity is lower than for the Q Q bond, it remains significant (~102) and might favour a multisite adsorption Moreover, we note that using Rh/silica, Boudart and Ptak [18b] found 53 kcal mol~1 for the activation energy of neopentane hydrogenolysis (rupture of a P Q carbon bond). In the present work, 3 ^OT P~Q ^d S Q carbon bond cleavages ranges from 56 to 60 kcal mol~1 depending on the rhodium dispersion. Isomemation of hexanes and hydrogenolysis of MCP Whatever the hydrocarbon processed, skeletal rearrangement remains a marginal reaction in alkane conversion over rhodium catalysts. A large body of works shows that alkane isomenzation over metals may proceed via the so-called bond shift and cyclic mechanisms (see [12] for a review). The prevailing mechanism depends on the nature and the dispersion of the metal The bond shift mechanism (Scheme 2) mainly occurs via metallocyclo- butane species [12,31a]. On large rhodium particles only MP intercon- version operates, and no isomenzation products have been detected in 22DMB and 2233TMB conversion. This observation makes unlikely the occurrence of a 1-3C complex in MP isomenzation, even though rhodacyclo- butane complexes have been reported recently in organometalhc chemistry [31b] A selective cyclic mechanism (SCM) may be suggested [21, 30, 31a]. To that purpose MP isomenzation will proceed via 1,5-dehydrocychzation, leading to adsorbed MCP which in turn gives MP by selective nng opening (Scheme 3) This SCM allows nng closure exclusively between methyhc terminal carbon atoms Corollary MCP ring opening mainly occurs at S S carbon bonds, as evidenced by the very low selectivity for nH formation on large rhodium particles. Furthermore, this is in agreement with the ease of Scheme 2 Isomenzation of 22DMB over Pt or Ir catalysts 108 ill II I ** w * Scheme 3 MP isomenzation and MCP hydrogenolysis on large Rh particles forming 1,2-dimetallodicarbene with 1,2-dimethylcyclobutane on rhodium films [28]. As previously mentioned, on small rhodium particles MP, nH and MCP have been detected in the reaction products in MP conversion, but not in the case of n-hexane. Neither bond shift nor selective cyclic mechanisms can explain these observations. A selective 1-5 ring closure followed by a non- selective ring opening may rationalize this behaviour. Since on large rhodium particles nng closure occurs preferentially at methylic terminal carbon atoms, then the adsorbed MCP intermediate can suffer a partially selective nng opening, as shown by the increasing amount of nH when the size of rhodium particles decreases. With this hypothesis the 1,5-dehydrocyclisation of MP and the MCP nng opening might follow different mechanisms on small rhodium particles. A similar proposal has been suggested by Finlayson et al [25] for hydrocrackmg and nng opening of cyclic and acyclic alkanes. The non-selective ring opening of MCP may proceed by ff-olefimc or Tr-allylic adsorption on a rhodium atom, followed by insertion of the metallic atom in the S S or S T carbon bond. Splitting of bonds involving primary, secondary and tertiary carbon atoms Geometrical effects can explain well the reactivities of bonds involving a Cq. Now considering P S and S S bonds, it appears clearly that the TOP and reactivity factor o> increase with the substitution of the C atom in the ^-position, namely that P-S(22DMB) > P-S(2MP, 3MP) > P-S(nH). Simi- lar behaviour has previously been found by Paal and Tetenyi [17] and Leclerq et al [13] on Rh and Pt catalysts respectively. These authors postu- lated a 1-3C complex doubly bonded at the Cp which exhibits high reactivity for j3-scission relative to the CT atom. This explanation alone is not sufficient for Rh, since the highest reactivity is observed with 22DMB where a 1-3C complex is excluded. Differences of activity may be accounted for in part by the hydrocarbon adsorption, which is highly favoured at P S and S S bonds (1-2C diadsorption) in nH five bonds of this type exist, but only two for 2MP and 3MP and one for 22DMB. It seems likely that an adsorp- 109 tion localized at the P S bond of 22DMB explams part of its high reactivity. Nevertheless, many results are not easy to include in this simple framework. Thus the P S bond in 22DMB is very sensitive to Rh particle size (~102) although the S S bond in 2MP is much less affected by it (<10). Moreover the activation energies for P S and S S bond ruptures change with disper- sion for nH and 2MP, and not for 22DMB. In hydrocarbons containing both P S and S S bonds, we also note that the reactivity factor a? moves significantly in favour of the S S bond at high dispersion. In contrast, for molecules without an S S bond (3MP and 22DMB), o; for the P S bond does not change. These facts provide strong support for preferential adsorp- tion at P S and S S bonds, and for the occurrence of two different mecha- nisms for P S and S S bond cleavage, depending on whether or not a CQ atom exists in the (3-position The first is a single site mechanism by ir-allyl adsorbed species, known to occur with mononuclear Rh complexes sup- ported on silica [32, 33], this pathway, possible with nH, 2MP and 3MP, is excluded with 22DMB due to the presence of the CQ atom (Scheme 4). Secondly, a multisite mechanism via a 1-2C complex similar to that operat- ing in ethane hydrogenolysis, 22DMB being the archetypical molecule for this route (Scheme 5). The former mechanism, mainly occurring on small particles, is the least sensitive to particle size, whereas the latter, favoured on large Rh clusters, is more dependent upon this factor. For nH, 2MP and 3MP both mechanisms can operate together, thus explaining the low particle size dependence as well as the change in activation energy.

Multisite mechanism for hexane hydrogenolysis 110 effect and constancy of activation energy in 22DMB conversion are similarly rationalized, since this alkane can react only by the multisite mechanism. Furthermore, we note that the activation energy of the P S carbon bond rupture in 22DMB ranges from 42 - 46 kcal mol\"1, and that Sinfelt and Yates [20] found 42 kcal mol\"1 and Rouco and Haller [34] 49 - 53 kcal mol~1 for ethane hydrogenolysis on Rh/sihca catalysts. With nH and 2MP, terminal splitting dominates on large Rh particles, such as on films [17]. On the smaller particles, internal cleavage is pre- dominant Moreover terminal splitting, which is the least activated reaction on poorly dispersed samples, becomes more activated when the dispersion increases All these facts lead us to conclude that a network of subtle in- fluences exists between bonds in different molecules, probably not only geometrical but also inductive, hgand or electronic effects must be con- sidered. Reactivity of P T and S T bonds seems to follow the same trends as for P S and S S bonds, since the changes in activity with dispersion do not exceed a factor of 10 Otherwise cleavage involving the CT atom is hindered and appears more activated than P S and S S bond splittings. Surprisingly, the ratio TOF(S S)/TOF(S T) in MCP and 2MP con- versions moves in opposition when the dispersion increases. At first sight this phenomenon does not arise from a change in S T bond rupture be- haviour, but more probably from a higher sensitivity to Rh particle size of the S S bond splitting of MCP Two different mechanisms occur in MCP ring opening or alkane hydrogenolysis, namely, formation of 1-2C multi- bonded species on large particles and w-allyl species on small particles We suggest that the proportion of each one is closely dependent on the nature of the alkane, in this scheme the smgle site mechanism will occur more easily with acyclic alkanes, perhaps due to plananty requirements which are easier to fulfill for 2MP than for MCP surface complexes Conclusion The fact that rhodium highly favours hydrocrackmg is a clear point appearing from this work As previously suggested in the literature, this behaviour can be explained by the facility with which rhodium forms metallocarbenes Superficial metallacycles appear more difficult to obtain on rhodium compared with platinum or palladium, thus hydrogenolysis of alkanes on a small metallic site likely proceeds via surface Tr-allyl species Consequently, our mam conclusion is that two large classes of surface intermediates may exist in the conversion of alkanes over supported rhodium catalysts first, metallocarbenes which prevail on large rhodium particles but are highly sensitive to rhodium dispersion, second, Tr-adsorbed allyl species which can occur with similar probabilities whatever the rhodium particle size The former is the only species occurring when the alkane reactant contains quaternary carbon atoms, as do 22DMB and 2233TMB, thus Ill clearly explaining the very high sensitivity of those compounds upon rhodium dispersion In contrast, the possible coexistence of metallocarbene and Tr-allyl complexes is a likely explanation for the relative msensitivity upon rhodium dispersion of nH, 2M and 3MP hydrocracking. In conclusion, the effect of particle size may appear enhanced or minimized in function of the molecule being processed, the structure sensi- tivity depending critically on the type of carbon bonds involved.

The influence of particle size has been investigated on the hydrogenolysis of n-hexane, methylpentanes, 2,2-dimethylbutane, 2,2,3,3-tetramethylbutane and methylcyclopentane using a series of Rh/Al2O3 catalysts of widely varying dispersion. Specific activities and selectivities vary in a limited range for n-hexane, whereas large variations are observed with 2,2,3,3-TMB and MCP. In all cases specific activities for hydrogenolysis increase with particle size. Some general rules appear for the influence of size on the splitting of the different bonds found in these alkanes: the cleavage of bonds involving only primary, secondary or tertiary carbon atoms is less sensitive to a change in particle size of the metal, since activities vary by less than a factor of ten. The activation energy for these reactions is lower than that observed for the hydrogenolysis of bonds involving a quaternary carbon atom. The splitting of these bonds is highly sensitive to the metallic dispersion, since specific activities can vary by four orders of magnitude between catalysts of high and low dispersion, for the splitting of biquaternary C-C bonds. These different behaviours can be rationalized assuming different types of adsorption of the hydrocarbon depending on the size of the metallic particles and the substitution of the carbon atoms.

        "dc:description": "The influence of particle size has been investigated on the hydrogenolysis of n-hexane, methylpentanes, 2,2-dimethylbutane, 2,2,3,3-tetramethylbutane and methylcyclopentane using a series of Rh/Al2O3 catalysts of widely varying dispersion. Specific activities and selectivities vary in a limited range for n-hexane, whereas large variations are observed with 2,2,3,3-TMB and MCP. In all cases specific activities for hydrogenolysis increase with particle size. Some general rules appear for the influence of size on the splitting of the different bonds found in these alkanes: the cleavage of bonds involving only primary, secondary or tertiary carbon atoms is less sensitive to a change in particle size of the metal, since activities vary by less than a factor of ten. The activation energy for these reactions is lower than that observed for the hydrogenolysis of bonds involving a quaternary carbon atom. The splitting of these bonds is highly sensitive to the metallic dispersion, since specific activities can vary by four orders of magnitude between catalysts of high and low dispersion, for the splitting of biquaternary C-C bonds. These different behaviours can be rationalized assuming different types of adsorption of the hydrocarbon depending on the size of the metallic particles and the substitution of the carbon atoms.",
