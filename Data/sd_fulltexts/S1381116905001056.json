A novel ligand modified heterogeneous catalyst has been developed for hydroformylation of propylene, which showed excellent activity, selectivity and stability and need not be separated from the product after reaction in a fixed-bed reactor. The coordination bonds between triphenyl phosphine (PPh3) and Rh/SiO2 were confirmed by means of thermogravimetric (TG), solid-state 31P NMR, XPS and FT-IR. Two types of active species for hydroformylation were formed, which were proved by in situ FT-IR techniques. The problem of metal leaching was greatly reduced by directly fastening Rh particles on the support, and the active Rh species that was responsible for the outstanding performance of propylene hydroformylation was tightly bound by the very strong metal–metal bonds. No sign of deactivation was observed over a period of more than 1000h on the condition that PPh3 was added at 300–350h of time on stream. Graphical abstract A novel heterogeneous PPh3-Rh/SiO2 catalyst showing high activity and selectivity under mild conditions (1MPa, 393K) has been developed; the problem of metal leaching is greatly reduced and no sign of deactivation is observed over a period of more than 1000h. Keywords Hydroformylation Propylene Heterogeneous Rh/SiO2 Phosphine ligands 1 Introduction Hydroformylation is one of the largest industrial processes (millions of tonnes annually) catalyzed by homogeneous transition metal complexes [1,2]. In spite of the high level of implemented commercial processes, their practical applications have been limited by difficulties in achieving industrially viable catalyst–product separation [3]. A series of studies of this catalyst system led to an understanding of the factors that govern reactivity and selectivity [4]: σ-donor ligands may inhibit the reaction completely, switching to stronger π-acceptor ligands such as phosphites leading to more active and more selective hydroformylation catalysts [5–8]. The new hydroformylation processes under investigation can be broadly grouped into two types. One is often referred to anchored catalysts [9], tethered catalysts [10], supported aqueous phase (SAP) catalysts [11,12] and supported ionic liquid phase (SILP) catalysts [13,14] as heterogenized homogeneous catalysts; the other is the biphasic system [15] using aqueous biphase [16], supercritical fluids [17–19] and ionic liquids [20]. In these works, interesting concepts have emerged, however, they suffer from low selectivity, reactivity (TOF) and recyclability, high metal leaching, or expensive ligands, and hence, need to be improved for practical applications [21]. Although hydroformylation of alkenes by heterogeneous catalysts is less extensively studied [22–24] than that by homogeneous transition metal complexes [25,26], heterogeneous hydroformylation is a promising process from academic and practical points of view. Therefore, we proposed to modify Rh/SiO2 with triphenyl phosphine (PPh3), in the hope that there might be chemical adsorption of PPh3 on Rh/SiO2, which may promote the in situ growth of the active species for hydroformylation in syngas atmosphere, and that the problem of metal leaching might be resolved by directly fastening the metal particles on the support. This catalyst designated by PPh3-Rh/SiO2 was applied to the hydroformylation of propylene. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of PPh3-Rh/SiO2 catalyst The catalyst was prepared using a commercial SiO2 (Qingdao Haiyang Chemicals Plant, specific surface area 250m2 g−1) as support. The support was impregnated with an aqueous solution of rhodium chloride (Johnson Matthey) using the incipient wetness method. After impregnation, the samples were first dried at 373K, then calcined at 673K in a quartz tube and finally reduced by H2 at 673K. The Rh loading was 1wt%. Rh/SiO2 precursor was introduced into the PPh3 solution in tetrahydrofuran and this mixture was stirred for 0.5h. The solvent was removed under vacuum at room temperature, and the resulting black PPh3-Rh/SiO2 (the molar ratio of P:Rh=10:1, unless specified) was stored under argon atmosphere. When the activity and the selectivity tended to decline in the range of about 300–350h time on stream, the PPh3-Rh/SiO2 catalyst was taken out from the reactor and allowed to contact the PPh3 solution in tetrahydrofuran. The solvent was removed under vacuum at room temperature after this mixture was stirred for 0.5h. Thus, treated PPh3-Rh/SiO2 catalyst was employed in the experiments of 1000h stability test of the catalyst. HRh(CO)(PPh3)3 was prepared according to a procedure reported earlier [27], and dissolved with PPh3 (the total molar P:Rh ratio=10:1) in toluene. Then SiO2 was introduced into this solution and the mixture was stirred for 0.5h. Finally the yellow HRh(CO)(PPh3)3/SiO2 was obtained after removing toluene. All manipulations were carried out under an argon atmosphere, and all reagents were dehydrated with CaH2 and degassed with argon. 2.2 Hydroformylation reaction The hydroformylation was conducted in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor (i.d. 4.6mm). The effluent was passed through a condenser filled with 100ml of cold de-ionized water. Butyraldehyde in the products of hydroformylation was captured completely by dissolution into the water in the condenser. An HP-6890N GC with an FFAP column, using an FID detector and ethanol as an internal standard, analyzed the aqueous solution containing butyraldehyde. The tail gas was analyzed on-line on an HP-6890N GC with a Porapak-QS column and a TCD detector. 2.3 Instrumentation Solid-state 31P-MAS NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker DRX-400 spectrometer. Data were obtained by measuring the samples using a frequency of 161.97MHz, a pulse width of π/8, a delay of 2.0s, and 100 scans. Solid-state 31P NMR chemical shifts were reported relative to 85% H3PO4. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were recorded on a Leybold AG LHS-12 MAS instrument, using radiation of unmonochromatized Mg Kα (photo energy −1253.6eV). In situ FT-IR spectra were measured by a Bruker EQUINOX 55 single-beam Fourier Transform infrared spectrometer equipped with a DTGS detector. All spectra were recorded with 16 scans with a resolution of 4cm−1. The sample wafer was mounted in a high temperature/high pressure cell (SPECAC INC P/N 5850) fitted with ZnSe windows and an automatic temperature controller; the cell is a water-cooled, stainless steel chamber. The sample was reduced in flowing H2 at 393K for 1h. After reduction, the catalyst was cooled down to 323K in a flow of N2 and was subjected to FT-IR measurement (spectrum A). Subsequently, a premixed (H2:CO:C2H4=1:1:1) gas was introduced into this system, and kept flowing for 30min under atmospheric pressure. After purging the chamber with high-purity nitrogen for 30min, spectrum B was recorded. Subtracting spectrum A from spectrum B gave a final FT-IR spectrum. We also analyzed the aqueous solution containing butyraldehyde with an inductive coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) measurement to detect metal leaching. PPh3 in the aqueous solution were analyzed by an Agilent 5973N GC–MS instrument. 3 Results and discussion In order to obtain information about the influence of PPh3 on the Rh/SiO2 catalyst, we have made a comparison of the catalytic performance of the HRh(CO)(PPh3)3-derived catalyst (HRh(CO)(PPh3)3/SiO2), conventional heterogeneous catalyst (Rh/SiO2) and PPh3-Rh/SiO2 with the same concentration of Rh in a fixed-bed reactor under the same conditions (Table 1 ). It is obvious that PPh3-Rh/SiO2 showed far higher activity (TOF, mol-butyraldehyde/(mol-Rhh)) and conversion of propylene) than that of the conventional heterogeneous catalyst. However, the activity was lower than the HRh(CO)(PPh3)3-derived catalyst due to the exposure of 67% of Rh particles, while the n/i ratio for PPh3-Rh/SiO2 was comparable to that for the HRh(CO)(PPh3)3/SiO2. After the reaction, the solution was transparent and colorless. The similar performance of PPh3-Rh/SiO2 and HRh(CO)(PPh3)3/SiO2 for hydroformylation of propylene, including propylene conversion, selectivity and n/i ratio of butyraldehydes, allowed us to propose that there might be coordination bonds between the ligands and the highly dispersed Rh species on the surface of Rh nano-particles. Consequently, we made an investigation of the interaction between PPh3 and Rh/SiO2 by means of thermogravimetric (TG), solid-state 31P NMR, XPS and in situ FT-IR techniques. Thermogravimetric analysis and TG derivative profiles of the SiO2, PPh3/SiO2 and PPh3-Rh/SiO2 samples are demonstrated in Fig. 1 . The great weight loss before 383K is due to the solvent evaporation. A large peak at about 513K and a relatively small peak at about 613K are assigned to the removal of physically and chemically adsorbed PPh3, respectively. Compared to PPh3/SiO2, PPh3-Rh/SiO2 shows a decrease in physically adsorbed PPh3 and an increase in chemically adsorbed PPh3. Solid-state 31P NMR techniques can provide evidence for the formation of the coordination bond. Solid-state 31P NMR spectra of PPh3 modified Rh/SiO2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 . In the spectrum A, there is a sharp absorption peak at −5.7ppm assigned to the free PPh3 in the PPh3/SiO2 sample. A broad peak at +35.4ppm due to the phosphines of rhodium complex appears in the spectrum of HRh(CO)(PPh3)3/SiO2 sample (Fig. 2 Curve D) [28]. As both the chemical shift and the feature of the absorption at +30.1ppm in spectrum B are similar to those of the peak at +35.4ppm in spectrum D, it is assigned to PPh3 that chemically adsorbed on the surface of Rh nano-particles. The chemical shift difference reasonably interpreted by assuming that the electronic state around these Rh species have been changed after being coordinated by PPh3, and is different from that around Rh+1. The sharp peak at −5.6ppm in PPh3-Rh/SiO2 sample is attributed to the free PPh3. Only a slight increase in the free PPh3 was observed after the PPh3-Rh/SiO2 catalyst was treated by syngas. The XPS results imply that Rh δ+ (0< δ <1) species with the binding energy of 307.5–308.0eV appears on the surface of supported metal nano-particles after PPh3-Rh/SiO2 sample was treated with syngas, while only Rh0 (307.2eV) species was detected in Rh/SiO2, Rh/SiO2 (treated by syngas) and PPh3-Rh/SiO2 samples. These binding energies are found to be in agreement with the literature values [29,30]. It is to be noted that Rh δ+ (0< δ <1) species in situ formed after the PPh3-Rh/SiO2 sample was treated with syngas; most Rh0 species in the Rh nano-particle on SiO2 could be oxidized to Rh δ+ as a result of reaction with syngas. We presume distribution of Rh species as shown in Fig. 3 , the Rh particle was directly fastened to SiO2 by interaction of Rh and SiO2 (RhO bonds) after calcination and most Rh species at the outer layer of Rh nano-particle were reduced to Rh0 species. After they had been chemically adsorbed by PPh3, these Rh0 species at the surface were oxidized to Rh δ+(0< δ <1) species by syngas and bound to the Rh0 layer in the bulk of metallic nano-particles, and all these exterior Rh species were tightly bound by the very strong metal–metal bonds [31]. When the coordination bonds between Rh δ+ and ligands are broken during catalytic reactions, Rh species is fixed on SiO2 by the RhO bonds and the very strong metal–metal bonds and PPh3 is inevitably leached in the case of PPh3-Rh/SiO2, however, the Rh ion may break away from the support in a homogeneous catalyst heterogenized on a solid support [21]. The RhO bonds and the strong metal–metal bonds is the reason for the problem of metal leaching being greatly reduced. Fourier transform infrared transmittance spectra of Rh/SiO2, HRh(CO)(PPh3)3/SiO2 and PPh3-Rh/SiO2 are demonstrated in Fig. 4 . There are three primary carbonyl species in the FT-IR spectrum of Rh/SiO2: geminal dicarbonyl of Rh(CO)2 with asymmetric and symmetric bands at 2095 and 2031cm−1; linear Rh x –CO at 2066cm−1; and bridged Rh2–CO at 1867cm−1, as originally assigned by Yang and Garland [32]. According to the earlier report of Wilkinson and co-workers [27,33], the broad band at 2005–2035cm−1 in the spectrum of HRh(CO)(PPh3)3/SiO2 suggests the existence of three species: HRh(CO)(PPh3)3, 2005cm−1; [Rh(CO)2(PPh3)3]2, 2017cm−1 and HRh(CO)2(PPh3)2, 2035cm−1, revealing the following equilibria: (1) HRh ( CO ) ( PP h 3 ) 3 ⇌ H 2 CO HRh ( CO ) ( PP h 3 ) 2 + PP h 3 (2) HRh ( CO ) ( PP h 3 ) 2 + CO ⇌ H 2 HRh ( CO ) 2 ( PP h 3 ) 2 (3) 2 HRh ( CO ) 2 ( PP h 3 ) 2 ⇌ H 2 CO [ Rh ( CO ) 2 ( PP h 3 ) 2 ] 2 + H 2 They also pointed out that in the above equilibria, the active species for hydroformylation was HRh(CO)2(PPh3)2, while the most stable species was [Rh(CO)2(PPh3)3]2. The HRh(CO)(PPh3)3 species and HRh(CO)2(PPh3)2 species predominate on PPh3-Rh/SiO2 as revealed by the peaks at 1920, 2003cm−1 and 1938, 2038cm−1, respectively. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider that the active species of HRh(CO)2(PPh3)2 for hydroformylation in situ form on the surface of Rh/SiO2 catalysts after PPh3-Rh/SiO2 is treated with a premixed gas (H2:CO:C2H4 =1:1:1). On the basis of TG, solid-state 31P NMR, XPS and in situ FT-IR results, we could conclude that chemical interactions do exist between PPh3 and Rh/SiO2, and the chemically adsorbed PPh3 promotes the in situ formation of HRh(CO)2(PPh3)2, which is responsible for active and selective hydroformyaltion of olefins, while the RhO bonds and the strong metal–metal bonds of Rh species might prevent Rh from leaching. The Bruker software WINNMR was employed for deconvolution using Gaussian–Lorentzian line-shapes. By integration of Curve B in Fig. 2, we found the percent area of the peak at +30.1ppm was 77%; therefore, the molar ratio of coordinated PPh3 to exposed Rh particles was calculated as follows: coordinated PP h 3 exposed Rh particles = the molar ratio of PP h 3 Rh × the percent area of coordinated PP h 3 the exposure of Rh where the exposure of Rh is 67% based on 0.64ml/g STP H2 adsorbed on Rh/SiO2 in hydrogen chemisorption experiment. The molar ratio of coordinated PPh3 to exposed Rh particles was about 3. Accordingly, we have made a model of our catalyst in Fig. 5 to expound the PPh3-Rh/SiO2 catalyst clearly. With the purpose of investigating the application of the PPh3-Rh/SiO2 catalyst, a series of propylene hydroformylation reactions was carried out in a fixed-bed reactor under different conditions. Fig. 6 shows the effect of space velocity and pressure on the activity of PPh3-Rh/SiO2 catalyst. The turnover frequency of formation of butyraldehyde and its n/i ratio increase with the space velocity, while the conversion of propylene decreases slightly. It is found that the TOF and conversion of propylene increase and the n/i ratio decreases with pressure. Due to the low reaction temperature of hydroformylation and the coordination bonds between Rh nano-particles and PPh3, the selectivity of butyraldehyde under all process conditions is as high as over 99.5% as expected. The evidence obtained from ICP-AES measurements shows that no Rh species in excess of 0.01ppm level was detected in the product solutions, while PPh3 was found in the GC–MS analysis of the product solutions. To make a comparison between HRh(CO)(PPh3)3/SiO2 and PPh3-Rh/SiO2, we also tested their stabilities and the results are given in Fig. 7 . It is obvious that the activity and the n/i ratio of HRh(CO)(PPh3)3/SiO2 reduce quickly after a run of 16h, while those of PPh3-Rh/SiO2 remain unchanged after a run of 33h. In particular, we have carried out the hydroformylation of propylene in a fixed-bed reactor for a period of over 1000h with the propylene conversion, n/i ratio and TOF remain approximately the same, on the condition that PPh3 is supplemented at about 300–350h of time on stream, and some representative data are shown in Table 2 . Consequently, we could deduce a conclusion that PPh3-Rh/SiO2 catalyst is nearly free of Rh metal leaching in the hydroformylation of propylene. 4 Conclusion The present work has shown that PPh3-Rh/SiO2 is a novel heterogeneous catalyst for hydroformylation of propylene. The TG, solid-state 31P NMR, XPS and in situ FT-IR techniques all confirm that PPh3 molecules could be chemically adsorbed on the heterogeneous Rh/SiO2, and that they promote the in situ formation of HRh(CO)(PPh3)3 species and HRh(CO)2(PPh3)2 species, which play an important role in improving the activity and selectivity of olefin hydroformylation. The problem of metal leaching is greatly reduced by directly fastening Rh nano-particles to the support, and Rh species are tightly bound by the RhO bonds and the very strong metal–metal bonds. Our observations are limited to the effect of PPh3 on Rh/SiO2, and further investigation on different ligands and supports would disclose an interesting prospective in heterogeneous catalysis.
