It was found by chromatography and 13C NMR spectroscopy that diethyl 2,3-diisobutyl succinate (DIBS), which is used as a stereoregulating electron donor in titanium–magnesium catalysts, exists as rac and meso stereoisomers. Their molecular structure was calculated using the DFT method. It was ascertained that mainly rac-DIBS is anchored to the surface of MgCl2. Subsequent interaction between the MgCl2/DIBS sample and TiCl4 leads to further removal of meso-DIBS. Titanium–magnesium catalysts of composition MgCl2/DIBS/TiCl4 prepared by different procedures contain 85–91% rac-DIBS. The IR spectroscopy data on the stereoisomeric configuration of DIBS in MgCl2/DIBS samples and titanium–magnesium catalysts MgCl2/DIBS/TiCl4 prepared by different procedures and the data on propylene polymerization over these catalysts are presented.

These catalysts belong to the family of Ziegler–Natta catalysts and are used in propylene polymerization in combination with a cocatalyst (triethylaluminium) and an additional stereoregulating agent (an external donor, ED), which is introduced to the reaction mixture along with AlEt3. The internal donor within a TMC ensures enhanced stereospecificity of the catalyst (isotacticity of the produced PP), while the external donor additionally increases stereospecificity of the catalytic system. The data on the role of internal and external donors of different composition in propylene polymerization over TMC and the effect of compositions of ID and ED on catalyst activity and stereospecificity as well as on the molecular weight distribution of the produced polypropylene are presented in reviews [1–3]. In most of the known TMC preparation procedures, an internal donor is added simultaneously with TiCl4 at the stage when the δ-MgCl2 support is formed from magnesium-containing compounds of different composition. In this case, the internal donor significantly effects on structural characteristics of the produced MgCl2 within TMC [4–7], making it possible to obtain TMC exhibiting high activity and stereospecificity. Furthermore, it is known that TMC containing ID of different composition produce PP with varied molecular weight distribution. Today, TMC containing three types of ID are used most commonly for producing PP with different MWD: (1) 1,3-diethers for producing narrow MWD PP (Mw/Mn = 3–4); (2) phthalates for producing PP with medium MWD (Mw/Mn = 4–5); and (3) succinates for producing PP with the broad MWD (Mw/Mn = 5–7). The third group of catalysts appeared later than the first and second ones. Findings on propylene polymerization over succinate-bearing TMC and properties of the produced polymer were reported in refs. [8–11]. The data on surface compounds of ID formed within TMC during their interaction with MgCl2 have been presented in many studies [2,5,7,12–20]. A noticeable part of these data was obtained using IR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Anchoring of these donors to the surface of magnesium dichloride was shown to occur upon interaction between the carbonyl group of carboxyl moiety and acidic surface sites of MgCl2 accompanied by formation of a set of surface compounds that are characterized by a broad IR band at 1630–1750 cm−1. A number of surface compounds have been identified by deconvoluting these spectra into individual components. It is supposed that most of these compounds having absorption bands centered at 1660–1670 cm−1 and 1700–1705 cm−1 are formed upon interaction with coordinatively unsaturated tetra- and pentacoordinated magnesium ions that reside on the lateral faces of crystallites of “activated” MgCl2 and exhibit Lewis acidic properties. The feasibility of formation of these surface compounds for ethyl benzoate and dialkyl phthalates was confirmed by DFT calculations [13,18–20]. Potapov et al. [16] reported the IR spectroscopy data on interaction between diethyl 2,3-diisopropyl succinate (DIPS) and “activated” magnesium dichloride. They demonstrated that a set of surface compounds having absorption bands (νC O) at 1630–1750 cm−1 is formed in this case, like when using diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP). However, for the MgCl2/DIPS sample, the ratio between the two major spectral components with absorption bands centered at 1670 and 1700 cm−1 differs noticeably from the ratio between these bands in the IR spectrum of the MgCl2/DIBP sample. This study reports that diethyl 2,3-diisobutyl succinate (DIBS) exists as two stereoisomers (the rac and meso isomers). With allowance for this fact, the interaction between DIBS and “activated” magnesium dichloride as well as the stereoisomeric configuration of DIBS in two TMC samples prepared using different methods have been studied. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials DIBS ( Scheme 1) was synthesized according to the procedure described in ref. [21]. DIBS, chlorobenzene, and heptane were dried over molecular sieves. 2.2 Synthesis of the model “activated” MgCl2 support The MgCl2 support was prepared via the interaction of magnesium powder with an excess amount of butyl chloride (BuCl/Mg = 3) in heptane at 98 °C according to ref. [22]. The support has the surface area SBET = 80 m2/g and contains approximately 10 wt. % of organic polymeric products. The MgCl2/DIBS samples were prepared by adding a calculated amount of DIBS to magnesium chloride suspension in chlorobenzene at 115 °C. The mixture was stirred during 1 h, washed once with chlorobenzene at 115 °C and thrice with heptane at room temperature. 2.3 Preparation of titanium–magnesium catalysts containing DIBS The model titanium–magnesium catalyst MgCl2/DIBS/TiCl4 (TMC-M) was prepared by treating of MgCl2/DIBS substrate with titanium tetrachloride at a TiCl4/MgCl2 molar ratio = 100 in chlorobenzene at 115 °C during 1 h. The resulting TMC-M catalyst was washed once with chlorobenzene at 115 °C and thrice with heptane at room temperature. The standard TMC-S was prepared in compliance with the procedure described in ref. [23]. According to this procedure, the first stage involved synthesis of pre-support via the interaction between organomagnesium compound Ph4Mg3Cl2 and tetraethoxysilane in dibutyl ether and chlorobenzene yielding support precursor particles of composition 2 Mg(OEt)2·MgCl2. At the second stage, the resulting support precursor was treated with a mixture of TiCl4 and DIBS at molar ratios DIBS/Mg = 0.1 and TiCl4/Mg = 30 at 115 °С. Next, the sample was treated twice with a mixture (1:1 vol.) of titanium tetrachloride and chlorobenzene at 115 °C and TiCl4/Mg molar ratio = 15. The resulting sample was washed thrice with heptane at room temperature. The produced catalyst was characterized by average particle size of 25 µm and high specific surface area according to the low-temperature nitrogen adsorption data (SBET = 470 m2/g). 2.4 Chemical analysis The Si, Al and Ti contents of the samples were determined by atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) on an Optima 4300 DV spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer). The contents of DIBS were measured by GC analysis using solutions of the compounds in acetonitrile. Acetonitrile (20 mL) was added to 0.1–0.15 g of the support or catalyst. The mixture was stirred during 1 h at room temperature. The resulting solution was analyzed by gas chromatography. The measurements were made on a Khromos GKh-1000 system using an SGE BP1 GC column (0.25 μm × 0.32 mm × 25 m), FID as a detector, and helium as a carrier gas. 2.5 FTIR measurements of the samples All the operations were carried out in an inert atmosphere of argon. All the samples were dried under vacuum to a residual pressure of 2·10−2 mbar before measurements. Samples (0.02–0.03 g) were transferred, under an inert atmosphere, to a cuvette suitable for FTIR characterization. The FTIR spectra were recorded on a FTIR-8400S Shimadzu spectrometer in the range of 400–6000 cm−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1. 2.6 1H NMR and 13C NMR measurements The 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV 400 spectrometer using 908 pulses (24 ms) with 2.7 s acquisition time and 1 s delay time. Before determining the stoichiometric configuration of both isomers, we performed complete signal assignment by combining one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy methods, including DEPT spectroscopy, the 1H–1H and 1H–13C two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy, the selective INEPT technique, and two-dimensional COLOC spectroscopy that allows one to correlate signals from 13C atoms with proton signals separated by two or three bonds: 13C-C-H or 13C-C-C-H. The diastereomeric ratio was determined by quantitative 13C NMR spectroscopy (inverse-gated proton decoupling (INVGATE) in combination with a long delay between scans to ensure complete nuclear spin relaxation). 2.7 Propylene polymerization Propylene polymerization was carried out in a 1.0 L reactor in a heptane medium at 70 °C, propylene pressure of 6 bar and hydrogen pressure of 0.14 atm during 1 h ([AlEt3] = 4 mmol/L) in the presence of cyclohexyl-methyl-di-methoxy silane as an external donor at an Al/CHMDMS molar ratio = 20; catalyst loading was 0.03–0.04 g/L. Stereospeciﬁcity of the catalyst was estimated as the xylene-insoluble portion of PP residue at room temperature (II = 100 – XS) according to ref. [24]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 The stereoisomeric composition and molecular structure of DIBS Fig. 1 shows a chromatogram of the DIBS sample as well as MgCl2/DIBS samples in acetonitrile solution. The chromatographic curve of DIBS solution (Fig. 1, curve A) contains two peaks with retention times of 16.3 min (peak 1) and 16.4 min (peak 2). The ratio between the areas of peaks (1) and (2) is 1:0.9. The presence of two peaks on the chromatogram gives grounds for assuming that the initial DIBS sample contains two stereoisomeric structures at a 1: 0.9 ratio. We studied the DIBS sample by 13C NMR to determine its stereoisomeric composition. Fig. 2 shows the 13C NMR spectrum of this sample. One can see that the spectrum contains two signals for each of the CH and CH2 moieties in isobutyl groups (at 47.2 ppm and 45.9 ppm for the CH moiety; 39.7 ppm and 39.2 ppm for the СН2 moiety in isobutyl groups). These results show that the DIBS sample contains two stereoisomers: the meso isomer, which is characterized by signals at 47.2 ppm and 39.7 ppm and the rac isomer characterized by signals at 45.9 ppm and 38.2 ppm. According to these data, the ratio between signal intensity in the 13C NMR spectrum corresponds to the meso/rac ratio, which is equal to 1:0.9 in the mixture of DIBS stereoisomers. These findings give grounds for assuming that peak (1) with τ = 16.3 min on the chromatographic curve (Fig. 1A) corresponds to meso-DIBS, while peak (2A) with τ = 16.4 min corresponds to rac-DIBS; the ratio between these isomers is 1:0.9. The structures of DIBS stereoisomers and their conformers were computed using the DFT (B3LYP/6–311+G(d,p)) method. Two energetically favorable diastereomeric structures were determined based on the results of DFT calculations ( Fig. 3). The conformer with C1 symmetry and the H-C*-C*-Н dihedral angle = 180° was identified for the meso isomer. The conformer with C2 symmetry and the H-C*-C*-Н dihedral angle = 170° was identified for the rac isomer. 3.2 Studying the interaction between DIBS and MgCl2 Two model MgCl2/DIBS samples were prepared by treating MgCl2 with DIBS solution in chlorobenzene at 115 °C at different molar ratio of MgCl2/DIBS (0.05 and 0.10) ( Table 1, exp. 1 and 2). One can see that both samples contain close amounts of DIBS (182 and 210 μmol DIBS/g MgCl2). Fig. 1 (curves B and C) shows chromatograms of the solutions obtained by dissolving MgCl2/DIBS in acetonitrile. Like for the initial DIBS (Fig. 1, curve A), these chromatograms contain two peaks with retention times of 16.30 and 16.39 min, which characterize meso- and rac-DIBS, respectively. However, the ratio between the intensities of these peaks for both MgCl2/DIBS samples differs drastically from that for the initial DIBS. As mentioned above, the meso/rac ratio being 1.0/0.9 in the initial DIBS sample. Meanwhile, rac-DIBS is the preferential isomer in MgCl2/DIBS samples, the rac/meso ratio being 2.2–2.9 in these samples (Fig. 1 and Table 1, exp. 1 and 2). Hence, the data obtained demonstrate that rac-DIBS is preferentially anchored to the surface of the MgCl2 support. The computed data on the molecular structure of the rac and meso stereoisomers of DIBS (Fig. 3) showed that meso-DIBS exists in the solution predominantly as a conformer whose carboxyl groups occupy trans-positions, thus probably impeding its adsorption onto the surface of magnesium chloride. Meanwhile, rac-DIBS preferentially exists in the solution as a conformer whose carboxyl groups occupy gauche positions, which does not impede its adsorption onto the surface of magnesium chloride. Our findings are good consistent with the results of DFT calculations [13] demonstrating that the rac stereoisomer of dimethyl 2,3-dimethyl succinate binds to the surface of magnesium chloride stronger than the meso stereoisomer does. Fig. 4 shows the IR spectrum of the initial DIBS solution (curve 1) and the IR spectrum of the MgCl2/DIBS sample (curve 2). Data on the content of DIBS in these samples are listed in Table 1 (exps. 1 and 2). One can see that the absorption band at 1733 cm−1 characterizing stretching vibrations νС=O in the carboxyl moiety of DIBS disappears as DIBS gets anchored to the MgCl2 surface, while a broad band at 1640–1750 cm−1 of the surface compounds of DIBS immobilized on magnesium chloride appears. These data indicate that DIBS is anchored to the MgCl2 surface due to interaction between the carbonyl group in the carboxyl moiety of DIBS and coordinatively unsaturated surface magnesium ions exhibiting Lewis acidic properties. This mechanism of anchoring of carboxyl-containing compounds was previously studied in IR spectroscopic studies focusing on interaction of ethyl benzoate and dibutyl phthalates with MgCl2 [12–20]. By deconvoluting the spectral profile (2) shown in Fig. 4 into individual components, we identified several components with absorption bands at 1620, 1670, and 1705 cm−1. The absorption band centered at 1620 cm−1 is characteristic of δ (H2O) of trace water bound to MgCl2; the absorption bands centered at 1670 cm−1 and 1705 cm−1 belong to νС=O of DIBS attached to tetra- and pentacoordinated magnesium ions, respectively. 3.3 Investigation of surface compounds of DIBS in TMC-M and TMC-S catalysts and the data on propylene polymerization over these catalysts The TMC-M catalyst has been prepared by treating the MgCl2/DIBS support with titanium tetrachloride (exps. 2 and 3 in Table 1). The data on composition of this catalyst are presented in Table 1 (exp. 3). One can see that treatment of the MgCl2/DIBS support with titanium tetrachloride noticeably reduces the DIBS content in the catalyst (from 210 to 98 μmol/g). The amount of immobilized TiCl4 in the TMC-M catalyst is 2.4-fold larger than the amount of DIBS removed from the MgCl2/DIBS support during catalyst preparation. This fact indicates that there are free sites on the surface of the MgCl2/DIBS support to which TiCl4 can be anchored. Furthermore, the rac-DIBS/meso-DIBS ratio in the TMC-M catalyst increases significantly (from 2.2 to 6.0) as one proceeds from the MgCl2/DIBS support to the TMC-M catalyst (exp. 2 and 3, Table 1). It indicates that meso-DIBS is weaker anchored to the MgCl2 substrate than rac-DIBS, and the meso stereoisomer of DIBS is preferentially removed from the MgCl2/DIBS support during the interaction with TiCl4. Fig. 4 (curves 2 and 3) shows the IR spectra of the samples of the MgCl2/DIBS support and TMC-M catalyst prepared using this support. One can see that both samples have similar broad absorption bands in the range of 1600–1750 cm−1. The IR spectrum of the TMC-M catalyst also contains an additional broad band centered at 1745 cm−1, which presumably belongs to acyl chlorides, the products of DIBS decomposition that are formed upon interaction between the MgCl2/DIBS support and TiCl4. Fig. 4 also shows the profiles of deconvoluting the IR spectra into individual components. The major components of these spectra can be identified (with absorption bands centered at 1670 and 1705 cm−1). As mentioned above in Item 3.2, these components are characteristic of surface DIBS compounds anchored to the tetra- and pentacoordinated magnesium ions on the MgCl2 surface. One can see that treatment of the MgCl2/DIBS support with TiCl4 solution (TMC-M catalyst) alters the ratio between the intensities of absorption bands centered at 1670 and 1705 cm−1( Table 2). The intensity ratio I(1705)/I(1670–1675) increases from 1.17 to 1.48 (exps. 1 and 2). These data demonstrate that treatment of the MgCl2/DIBS support with TiCl4 solution leads to preferential removal of DIBS anchored to tetracoordinated magnesium ions. It is interesting to compare data on the surface species of DIBS in the model TMC-M catalyst produced using the MgCl4/DIBS support and the real highly active TMC-S catalyst prepared via the procedure described in the Experimental. The key difference in the procedure used for producing the TMC-S and TMC-M catalysts is that for the TMC-S catalyst, the support and the catalyst are formed in the presence of both components (DIBS and TiCl4). In this case, the internal donor (DIBS) can have a profound effect on structural characteristics of the support and the catalyst, the porous structure of the catalyst, and the pattern of anchoring of DIBS and TiCl4 to the MgCl2 support within the catalyst [2–7,12,25]. The data on compositions of the TMC-M and TMC-S catalysts are listed in Table 1 (exp. 3 and 4). One can see that DIBS and titanium contents in the TMC-S catalyst are much higher than those in the TMC-M catalyst. For the TMC-S catalyst, the DIBS/Ti molar ratio is also significantly increased, which is an essential prerequisite for attaining high stereospecificity of these catalysts. Furthermore, the rac-DIBS/meso-DIBS ratio in TMC-S catalysts is maximal (10.5; Table 1, exp. 4). Therefore, the highly active and stereospecific TMC-S catalyst preferentially contains the rac isomer of DIBS (91%). Fig. 4 (curves 3 and 4) shows the IR spectra of the TMC-M and TMC-S catalysts, as well as the profile of deconvoluting these spectra into individual components. Both spectra contain three identical components belonging to the DIBS surface compounds with absorption bands centered at 1650, 1670, and 1705 cm−1. The potential pattern of DIBS anchoring to the MgCl2 support corresponding to these absorption bands was discussed earlier in Item 3.2. As one proceeds from the TMC-M to the TMC-S catalyst, the ratio between the intensities of absorption bands centered at 1705 cm−1 and 1670–1675 cm−1 (Table 2) rises from 1.48 to 1.58, which corresponds to the increase in the fraction of DIBS surface compounds anchored to pentacoordinated magnesium ions. Table 3 summarizes the data on the composition of the TMC-M and TMC-S catalysts, their activity and stereospecificity in propylene polymerization. One can see that activity and stereospecificity of the TMC-S catalyst are substantially higher compared to those of the TMC-M catalyst. In the TMC-S catalyst, titanium content and the DIBS/Ti molar ratio are much higher than those in the TMC-M catalyst (Table 3). Furthermore, the TMC-S catalyst is characterized by high specific surface area. The simultaneous presence of an internal donor (DIBS) and TiCl4 during formation of the “activated” MgCl2 and titanium–magnesium catalyst apparently ensures the required specific surface area of the catalyst and potentially, the optimal structural characteristics of the “activated” MgCl2 in the produced catalyst as well as the optimal ratio between the internal donor and titanium in the catalyst. 4 Conclusions It has been revealed by chromatography and 13C NMR spectroscopy that diethyl 2,3-diisobutyl succinate, which is used as an internal stereoregulating donor in titanium–magnesium catalysts of propylene polymerization, exists as a two stereoisomers (the rac and meso isomers) that are present in DIBS at a 0.9: 1.0 ratio. The molecular structures of rac- and meso-DIBS has been calculated using DFT with allowance for the 13C NMR spectroscopy data. The interaction between DIBS and “activated” MgCl2 has been studied and the data on the rac-DIBS/meso-DIBS ratio in MgCl2/DIBS samples have been obtained. The rac isomer is found to preferentially anchor to the MgCl2 surface, and the rac/meso ratio in these samples is 2.2–2.9. The IR spectroscopy data recorded for the MgCl2/DIBS samples indicate that DIBS is attached to the surface of “activated” MgCl2 due to interaction between the С=О group in the carboxyl moiety of DIBS and Lewis acidic sites of magnesium dichloride yielding a number of surface compounds whose absorption bands (νC O) lie in the range of 1640–1705 cm−1. It has been found that upon the interaction between the MgCl2/DIBS support and TiCl4 at 115 °C, most DIBS (53%) is removed, while TiCl4 is anchored to the support, and the MgCl2/DIBS/TiCl4 catalyst (TMC-M) with the DIBS/TiCl4 molar ratio = 0.41 is formed. The fraction of rac-DIBS in the TMC-M catalyst increases noticeably, being as high as 85%. Therefore, meso-DIBS is weaker attached to the MgCl2 surface compared to the rac-isomer, so the former isomer is preferentially removed from the MgCl2/DIBS support during the interaction with TiCl4. The IR spectroscopy data suggest that treatment of the MgCl2/DIBS support with titanium tetrachloride yielding the TMC-M catalyst results in preferential removal of DIBS attached to tetracoordinated magnesium ions. Data obtained for the model TMC-M catalyst characterized by low titanium and DIBS contents and exhibiting low activity in propylene polymerization are compared with data obtained for highly active and stereospecific TMC-S catalyst. In this case, the support (“activated” MgCl2) and the catalyst are formed simultaneously in a single process in the presence of DIBS and TiCl4. The TMC-S catalyst is characterized by high surface area and higher DIBS and TiCl4 contents at the higher molar ratio of DIBS/TiCl4 = 0.86. The content of rac-DIBS is maximal in this catalyst (91%). According to the IR spectroscopy data, DIBS is anchored preferentially to pentacoordinated magnesium ions in this catalyst. CRediT authorship contribution statement Valentina N.

        "dc:description": "It was found by chromatography and 13C NMR spectroscopy that diethyl 2,3-diisobutyl succinate (DIBS), which is used as a stereoregulating electron donor in titanium–magnesium catalysts, exists as rac and meso stereoisomers. Their molecular structure was calculated using the DFT method. It was ascertained that mainly rac-DIBS is anchored to the surface of MgCl2. Subsequent interaction between the MgCl2/DIBS sample and TiCl4 leads to further removal of meso-DIBS. Titanium–magnesium catalysts of composition MgCl2/DIBS/TiCl4 prepared by different procedures contain 85–91% rac-DIBS. The IR spectroscopy data on the stereoisomeric configuration of DIBS in MgCl2/DIBS samples and titanium–magnesium catalysts MgCl2/DIBS/TiCl4 prepared by different procedures and the data on propylene polymerization over these catalysts are presented.",
