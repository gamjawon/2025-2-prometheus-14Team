Spronk, A. Andreini and J. C. Mol* Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Amsterdam, Nieuwe Achtergracht 166, 1018 WV Amsterdam (The Netherlands) Abstract The stability of supported Rea07 metathesis catalysts during the metathesis of propene has been studied in a micro catalytic flow reactor. Promoting the metathesis catalysts with alkyltin compounds led to a large increase in activity, but the stability of the catalyst decreased considerably. The stability of the catalysts appeared to be influenced to a large degree by the choice of support: a 3 wt.% Re207/Si02-Al203 catalyst promoted with tetraethyltin proved to be much more stable than a corresponding -/-alumina-supported one. However, the stability of an alumina-supported catalyst can be improved by increasing its rhenium content: a Regf^/Al^Oa catalyst containing 12 wt.% ReaOy turned out to be the most stable. This is not the case for catalysts on silica-alumina. This can be explained on the basis of the different types of hydroxyl groups of the support that can react with ReC>4' ions. The use of a -/-alumina guard bed in the reactor can increase the stability of a 12 wt.% ReaOr/AlaOa catalyst. This is probably not only due to purification of the feed but also to the gradual release of the promoter from the guard bed onto which it was originally adsorbed. Besides the poisoning of the catalyst, which occurs due to impurities in the feed, an intrinsic deactivation mechanism is also present. This deactivation mechanism is strongly temperature dependent: the lower the reaction temperature the more stable the system. It could be shown by means of temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO), differential thermogravimetry (DTG) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) that the promoter is bonded to the catalyst and that regeneration of a spent catalyst results in formation of SnOa which remains behind on the catalyst surface. A mechanism is proposed for the first alkylation by the promoter of the oxidic catalyst, in which the tin atom of the promoter becomes bonded to rhenium via an oxygen bridge. Introduction Supported rhenium catalysts for the metathesis of alkenes have been the subject of many studies in the past 20 years [1]. These studies usually deal with the catalyst ReaOy/AlaOs. The use of a tetraalkyltin compound as a promoter for these catalysts was first described in a patent in 1974 [2]. Verkuyien et al. [3] discovered that a ReaOy/AlgOs catalyst, when promoted with Sn(CH3)4, is active for the metathesis of functionalized olefins. Promoted rhenium oxide-based catalysts are already commercially applied for the metathesis of normal alkenes [4], although it has not been disclosed *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/91/S3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 220 which promoter is used. Only a few papers so far have dealt with these tetraalkyltin-promoted catalysts for the metathesis of normal alkenes [5, 6]. We chose the metathesis of propene as a model reaction to study these promoted catalysts in more detail. Besides good activity and high selectivity, the lifetime, or stability, of a catalyst under practical working conditions often plays a crucial role in the commercialization of a process. Therefore, we systematically studied the factors involved in the deactivation of (promoted) rhenium-based catalysts. One of these factors is the choice of the support, The role of the support in the initiation or propagation steps as well as in the deactivation reactions is still not well understood. The role of the promoter has been the subject of much debate, mainly in the case offunctionalized olefins [ 1 ]. For heterogeneous metathesis catalysts many questions have remained unanswered. The answers to these questions are important not only from a scientific point of view, but also from a practical point of view. When such promoted catalysts are to be used on a large scale, it is also important to know what happens to the promoter during reaction and regeneration, since tetraalkyltin compounds are toxic substances. There- fore, we also studied the fate of the promoter. Experimental Catalysts and pretreatments All catalysts were prepared by pore-volume impregnation of the support with calculated amounts of an aqueous solution of ammonium perrhenate (Johnson Matthey JMC 836 Specpure), followed by drying overnight at 383 K in air. The supports used were -/-alumina (Keljen CK 300, 5'^ = 208 n^g\" \\ 180-250 iim) and silica-alumina (Akzo SA-HA, 24.3 wt.% AlgOa, 374 m2 g~1, 180 250 /xm). The catalyst samples were calcined in situ. The promoters used were tetraoctyltin (TOT) (Fluka), tetrabutyltin (TBT), tetraethyltin (TET) and tetramethyltin (TMT) (Aldrich, 97%), tetraethyllead (TEL) and tetrabutyllead (TBL) (home-made). Activity measurements The deactivation experiments were carried out in a conventional mi- crocatalytic fixed-bed flow reactor. The reactor was a quartz tube (10 mm i.d.), which could be placed in a vertical oven. In a typical experiment, a catalyst sample of 200 mg was placed in the reactor and calcined for 2 h in an oxygen stream (50 ml min~1) at 823 K (heating rate 10 K min\"1), followed by a nitrogen purge for 1 h at 823 K. The reactor was subsequently removed from the oven, and cooled to room temperature in 5 to 10 min. A silica alumina-supported catalyst was calcined at 773 K, because of possible loss of rhenium at higher temperatures. After the catalyst was left under nitrogen for a period of 1 h at room temperature, the promoter was added by means of a hypodermic syringe through a septum at an injection port upstream of the catalyst bed. During impregnation with the promoter the 221 bed was occasionally shaken, to insure a homogeneous distribution of the promoter over the catalyst. A fixed amount of promoter was used with all catalysts, independent of their loading, normally in undiluted form (TET). This resulted in an atomic Sn:Re ratio of 1:1 for a 3 wt.% catalyst and 1:4 for a 12 wt.% catalyst. In the case of a comparative study between different promoters, the promoters were diluted in hexane and brought onto the catalyst bed. Standard reaction conditions were a contact time (WIF) of 3.52 kg (cat) s per mol (200 mg of catalyst and a propene How of 83.2 cm3 per min), a pressure of 1.5 bar and room temperature (293 K). The propene (Matheson, C.P.) was purified by means of purification beds containing y- alumina, 3A molecular sieves and Cu/AlgOs, respectively. The reaction products were analysed on line by an Intersmat gas chro- matograph, using a 30% bis(2(2-methoxy,ethoxy)ethyl) ether on a Chromo- sorb P column (12 inch X 1/8 inch o.d.) and a flame ionisation detector. The GC signals were real time processed by a Milton Roy CI-10 integrator. Temperature-programmed oxidation Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) was carried out in a quartz reactor tube (i.d. 4 5 nun) by placing approximately 135 mg of catalyst between two quartz wool plugs, after which the temperature of the sample was increased linearly from room temperature to 973 K at a heating rate of 10 K per min. The feed gas consisted of 20 vol.% Oa in He (2.5 JU,mol Oa s~1). The product mixture was passed over a CuO column (1115 K) in order to quantitatively convert CO and partially burned hydrocarbons into COg. Subsequently, the reaction products (COg and HgO) were trapped in a column containing 5A molecular sieves. The Oa content of the remaining mixture was monitored continuously with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Samples of the product mixture were taken by means of a sampling valve, placed directly behind the CO-converter and before the product trap, at preset time intervals, and gas chromatographically analyzed to determine the COg production. Calibration of the TCD and the gas chromatograph was performed using MogC. Differential thermogravimetry Differential thermogravimetry (DTG) was carried out on a Setaram (TG 85) thermobalance in a flow of dry air (150 ml min\"1) at a heating rate of 10 K min\"1. Weight losses were measured as a function of temperature; the first derivative of this weight signal was plotted against temperature. In a typical experiment approximately 40 mg of catalyst was used. An empty sample holder was used as reference. Energy dispersive analyses of X-rays Rhenium and tin measurements were carried out by means of Energy Dispersive Analyses of X-rays (EDAX) in a Philips SEM-505 electron mi- croscope coupled to an EDAX-9900 X-ray microanalysis system. A small amount of the powdered catalyst was placed on a sample holder which 222 contained a double-sided adhesive tape. Metal contents were calculated from the intensity of the Al Ka-, the Sn La- and the Re Ma-lines, as the mean of a number of particles by using a 30 keV electron beam. Results Deactivation experiments The deactivation of TET-promoted catalysts was monitored by measuring the propene conversion as a function of the process time. All catalysts started off at equilibrium conversion and their activity gradually decreased with time. The conversion after 15 h was chosen as a measure of the stability and was plotted against the rhenium loading for different supports (Fig. 1). The dashed line represents the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion [7]. Figure 1 shows that a 3 wt.% catalyst with silica-alumina as a support is markedly more stable than 3 wt.% RegOy/AlaOa. An increase in the weight percentage rhenium oxide, however, strongly improves the stability of alumina-supported catalysts. This effect is not detected for the silica-alumina-supported catalysts: it even seems that increasing the rhenium content of silica alumina-supported catalysts results in a decrease in stability. In order to understand the nature of the difference in stability between a 6 wt.% and a 12 wt.% RegOy/AlgOs catalyst, we studied these two catalysts more closely. For a direct comparison, 200 mg of 6 wt.% RegC^ catalyst (normal amount) was compared with 100 mg 12 wt.% RegOy catalyst, mixed with 100 mg of AlgOg. The latter situation is schematically drawn in Fig. 2 0 5 10 15 20 Re,0, / wt% Fig. 1. Propene conversion after 15 h as a function of the weight percentage Re^ for different supports.

Since the same absolute amount of tin compound was added, both catalyst beds now contained the same calculated amounts of rhenium, tin and aluminium. Figure 2 shows the deactivation curves for these systems. Both systems reach the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion at (=0. Nevertheless, the 12 wt.% catalyst mixed with Al^Og performs markedly better than the 6 wt.% catalysts. The addition of alumina to the 12 wt.% Re^Oy catalyst can be done in two other ways (configurations), namely with the alumina underneath the catalyst (B) or with the alumina on top of the catalyst bed (T). Apparently, adding the alumina on top of the catalyst bed gives the most stable system with a 12 wt.% catalyst. In contrast, extra alumina on top of a 6 wt.% catalyst does not influence its stability. In an experiment with a 6 wt.% RegC^/AlgOa catalyst, we stopped the propene flow after 20 min and kept the catalyst under a propene atmosphere at the reaction temperature for 17 h. On restoring the propene flow we then measured a conversion approximately equal to the conversion of a catalyst that had been on stream for 17 h. However, when a similar experiment was carried out leaving the catalyst under a nitrogen atmosphere for 17 h, no deactivation was detected (Fig. 3). Figure 4 shows the influence of the reaction temperature on the deac- tivation rate of a 12 wt.% Reat^/AlgOa catalyst promoted with TET. When the reaction temperature is raised from 293 to 353 K the stability decreases, whereas lowering the reaction temperature to 263 K results in an increase 224 4U eq <T^-^----------------------------------------A------- ^\\^ NITROGEN ^ 30 ''0. ^. ^^^^ '0 1 20 ^'\"-0-^^ L- ~~~~--0 1) A > PROPENE 0 10ft 10 15 20 Process time / h Fig. 3.

(*) unpromoted catalyst. in stability. At the latter temperature no deactivation was noticed for a period of over 60 h. The difference in initial activity at different temperatures is caused by the shift in thermodynamic equilibrium conversion. In Fig. 4, the deactivation curve of an unpromoted catalyst at 353 K is also shown. The rate of deactivation of this catalyst is much lower than that of its promoted 225 counterpart, and the activity of the promoted catalyst eventually drops to that of the unpromoted catalyst. The influence of different alkyltin promoters on the stability of the catalyst was also tested at 353 K (Fig. 5). Little improvement can be achieved by using a promoter other than TET, although TBT proved to be the best promoter under our reaction conditions. The deactivation curves of catalysts promoted with TEL and TBL are not shown here; both promoters performed less well than TMT. Temperature-programmed oxidation and differential thennogravimetry To determine if deactivation at 353 K is caused by side reactions such as polymerization of the allcenes involved, we studied our catalysts with temperature-programmed oxidation. Figure 6 shows two TPO patterns of a 12 wt.% Regt^/AlaOs catalyst promoted with TET. One catalyst had been on stream for 20 min at 353 K and still had full activity (thermodynamic equilibrium). The other catalyst had been on stream for 17 h and its conversion had decreased to less than 10%. The patterns of both COg production and Oa consumption proved the same for the two catalyst samples. Further experiments were carried out to determine the carbon sources of the TPO peaks. Figure 7 shows the TPO patterns of 12 wt.% Re207/Ala03 catalysts, with different promoters, after 17 h reaction at 353 K. A large peak at 535 K is present on catalysts promoted with TET, TBT and TOT. This peak is split into two peaks on the catalyst promoted with TMT. The size of the peak is roughly proportional to the number of carbon atoms in the promoter. The peak at 753 K also shows a correlation with the number (0 ^ c o 0 Process time / h Fig. 5.

The peak at 453 K, which is present on the unpromoted catalyst and which can also be seen on the promoted catalysts, is assigned to the oxidation of alkenes adsorbed on the catalyst surface. This oxidation probably takes place in the CO converter, placed after the reactor (see Experimental). When the unpromoted catalyst was stripped under nitrogen for 2 h at 473 K prior to the TPO analysis, this peak was not detected. This indicates that it is a compound which can desorb from the surface at relatively low temperatures. The TPO patterns of 12 wt.% catalysts promoted with TEL and TBL are shown in Fig. 8. The main peak, situated at 535 K in Fig. 7, has now shifted to a lower temperature (508 K). In contrast, the peak at 753 K remained in the same position. Again, there seems to be a correlation between the size of these two peaks and the number of carbon atoms in the promoter. Integration of both the Oa consumption and COg production peaks of the TPO patterns, when multiplied by the calibration factor, give results which correspond roughly with the total theoretical amount of Og consumed and COa produced if a total oxidation of MR4 (M=Sn or Pb) to COa, HaO and MOg is taken as the only occurring reaction. Only for the catalyst promoted with TOT were the amounts of Og consumed and COg produced clearly less than calculated. 227 500 700 900 300 500 700 Temperature / K Temperature / K Fig. 8.

Figure 9 shows the DTG patterns of the catalysts promoted with the tin- containing compounds. If we compare these DTG patterns with the TPO patterns (Fig. 7), we observe an extra peak at low temperature (373 K). This peak is due to loss of physisorbed water, which was adsorbed on the catalyst when the sample was transferred to the TPO apparatus. Furthermore, we see that the peak at 535 K, characteristic for promoted catalysts, has vanished on the TMT-promoted catalyst. On the TET-promoted catalyst this peak might be present, but is partially masked by the large water-desorption peak. Only on the catalysts promoted with TBT and TOT do we see a clear peak at 535 K. The peaks at 753 K were not altered relative to the TPO patterns. EDAX EDAX measurements were performed to check whether tin remains behind on the catalyst surface after regeneration (Table 1). The Table shows that after 20 min and 17 h of reaction and after regeneration, the same amount of tin is present within the experimental error. It should be noted 228 TABLE 1 Aluminium, rhenium and tin content analysis by means of EDAX of fresh, used and regenerated 12 wt.% Re207/Al20a-SnEt4 catalysts.

Whether the tin is really present as SnOg after regeneration has not been established, but from the literature [8], this seems most likely. Discussion Influence of the support on the stability We observed differences in deactivation rate for several Re-based catalysts. It was almost impossible to choose reaction conditions that resulted in initial conversions below the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion because of the very high activity of the promoted catalysts. Therefore the differences in deactivation rate could be caused by either a faster deactivation process or a different number of active sites with the same deactivation rate. Some additional activity measurements (W/F=0.68 kg(cat)s/mol) did show that a 12 wt.% catalyst is more active than a 6 wt.% catalyst. We therefore conclude that the differences in stability can mainly be assigned to a difference in catalyst activity. It appears that the type of support strongly influences the relationship between stability and weight percentage rhenium oxide. Kapteyn et al. [9] already showed that for unpromoted ReaC^/AlgOa catalysts the rate ofpropene metathesis increases almost exponentially with increasing RegOy content. The catalytic activity of these unpromoted catalysts is probably limited only by the maximal amount of rhenium oxide that can be anchored on an alumina surface. Indeed, it has been shown in the literature that there is a maximum loading, which depends on the type of alumina used [10, 11]. On the surface of y-alumina, five types of hydroxyl groups exist [12]. The calculated charge on these hydroxyl groups varies between +0.5 and 0.5. An explanation for the increasing activity (or stability) with increasing weight percentage rhenium oxide can be given on the basis of the reaction of Re04~ ions with these surface hydroxyls. Let us assume that a precursor of an active site is formed only in the case in which Re04~ ions react with, 229 or replace, a specific type of hydroxyl group. Apparently, at low loadings Re04~ ions have then preferentially replaced one or more of the four other types of hydroxyl groups, which leads to only a very small number of active sites. Increasing the rhenium content leads to more Re04~ ions which have replaced this specific type of hydroxyl group, thus giving more active sites. On silica-alumina with an alumina content of up to 25%, two types of hydroxyl groups have been detected by means of IR spectroscopy [13]. One is similar to those present on silica and one is associated with bridging hydroxyls between silicon and aluminium ions. The high activity at low rhenium loadings of silica alumina-supported catalysts can then be explained by a preferential adsorption of Re04~ ions on these bridging hydroxyls, followed by anchoring during the calcination procedure, since rhenium oxide on pure silica is not active in metathesis [6]. When the rhenium oxide content is increased, the activity will rise [5]. Finally all bridging hydroxyls will be occupied and additional rhenium oxide will then become bonded mainly to silica. When a promoter is used, however, the activity (or stability) of rhenium oxide on silica-alumina decreases with increasing rhenium oxide content (Fig. 1). In our experiments we added a fixed amount of TET to all catalysts, independent of their loading. The promoter is thought to be responsible for the creation of the majority of the active sites for metathesis, i.e. metal-carbenes (vide infra). When a large amount of rhenium is present that cannot give active sites, it will prevent the promoter from reacting with the proper rhenium species, thus leading to an even lower activity. This can also explain the fact that an 18 wt.% RegOy/AlgOa catalyst is somewhat less stable than a 12 wt.% RegOy/AlaOs catalyst (Fig. 1). The bridging hydroxyls on silica alumina have a Bronsted acid character and can be viewed as positively charged. The support we used is one of the most acidic silica-aluminas commercially available [14]. If we relate the acidity of the hydroxyl groups of silica-alumina to the five types of hydroxyl groups on -y-alumina, we might conclude that the most positively charged hydroxyls on y-alumina lead to active sites after they have been replaced by Re04 -. The Bronsted-acid nature of the positively charged hydroxyl groups stems from its electron-withdrawing surroundings (or Lewis acidity of the support). Consequently, the Re04 groups linked to sites previously covered by acidic hydroxyl groups will have a lower electron density. This is probably a prerequisite for catalytic activity; Lewis acids are often needed in homo- geneous metathesis catalysts [15]. Horton et al. [16] suggest that active metal-carbenes based on rhenium are in their highest oxidation state. They synthesized high-oxidation state Re-carbenes, which, however, did not show any catalytic activity. They concluded that their complexes are not electrophilic enough and that cationic complexes might give the desired activity [16]. The addition of a strong Lewis acid might also give the desired activity. Another explanation for the relationship between activity and rhenium oxide content shown by alumina-supported catalysts could be the formation of rhenium clumps or clusters at higher loadings [17, 18]. However, this 230 seems unlikely for the silica-containing catalysts, since they have a low loading and a very high surface area. Deactivation For the deactivation of rhenium based metathesis catalysts, several possible routes can be envisaged [1, 19]: (1) poisoning by trace impurities in the feed; (2) oven-eduction of the rhenium past its optimal oxidation state; (3) adsorption of polymeric byproducts on the surface of the catalyst, blocking the active sites or even the catalyst pores; (4) termination via the reaction of two metal carbenes, (5) reductive elimination of the metallacyclobutane intermediate resulting in the formation of cyclopropane or an alkene (Scheme 1); (6) termination caused by the reversal of the initiation steps, for instance /3-proton abstraction (intramolecularly or intermolecularly) followed by a- proton addition [20]. We attribute the positive effect on the stability of extra alumina in the reactor to the adsorption of the promoter on this alumina, after which it is slowly released and then adsorbs onto the catalyst. In Fig. 2 one can indeed see that the activity of the catalyst just after start-up is very low, due to the fact that the promoter is first trapped on the alumina. Once the propene has reached the alumina, the tin compound is slowly released and the conversion rapidly increases. This slow release can be followed visually, since the colour of the catalyst changes from white to brown as soon as it comes into contact with TET. After a short time the activity of the catalyst is already so high that equilibrium conversion is reached. The release of the promoter from the alumina probably continues for several hours, thus constantly creating new active sites, resulting in a better stability than without extra alumina. This means that in practice a promoter should be added in small portions over a large time span. Indeed, we observed that spreading the addition of the total amount of TET over a large time span leads to better stability [21]. A second role of the extra alumina could be removal of trace impurities still present in the feed despite rigorous purification. The most likely impurity (n-2)* Re + (n-2 * Re / H > Re + Scheme 1. 231 still present in the propene feed is carbonyl sulfide (COS), which is very difficult to separate from propene by means of distillation [22]. However, poisoning by impurities in the feed does not seem to be an important deactivation mechanism, because a 6 wt.% catalyst deactivated as quickly in flowing propene as it did under a static propene atmosphere (Fig- 3). It is remarkable that extra alumina had no effect when a 6 wt.% catalyst was used. This could be due to the fact that on a 6 wt.% catalyst only such a small amount of active sites can be generated by TET, that shortly after start-up all these sites have already been formed and all the TET released from the guard bed thereafter has no effect. This was confirmed by experiments in which a second portion of promoter was added to both deactivated 6 wt.% and 12 wt.% ReaC^/AlaOa catalysts. Only the addition to the 12 wt.% catalyst resulted in an increase in activity [21]. The fact that a 6 wt.% catalyst deactivates only under a propene atmosphere (Fig. 3) indicates that an intrinsic deactivation mechanism, in which an alkene participates, is at work. The TPO patterns of the fully active and the deactivated catalyst (Fig. 6) show no differences. From this it can be concluded that the deactivation at 353 K is not caused by polymerization reactions, since a buildup of polymers on the surface would lead to an extra Og consumption peak and an extra COa production peak. Oven-eduction of the rhenium oxide is also not likely, since this would also lead to an extra Og consumption peak. One should, however, bear in mind that only a small fraction of the rhenium atoms on the catalyst surface form active sites. TPO is a bulk technique, so this does not conclusively prove that oven-eduction of the active site does not take place. The fact, however, that the deactivation experiments are performed at very mild reaction conditions makes it a less probable mechanism. There are still several other possible mechanisms for deactivation: a termination reaction between two metal carbenes, the formation of cyclo- propane or alkenes from the metallacyclobutane intermediate and termination by the reversal of the initiation reaction. A termination reaction involving two metal-carbenes seems unlikely for a heterogeneous metathesis catalyst, since (1) the metal carbenes are probably far apart and anchored to the support and (2) the deactivation should then continue under a nitrogen atmosphere. This second reason also rules out a termination caused by the reversal of the initiation steps. The only plausible mechanism left seems to be cyclopropanation or alkene formation from the metallacyclobutane in- termediate. This indeed needs an alkene to be present to form the intermediate metallacyclobutane. As we saw from the experiments carried out at different temperatures (Fig. 4), the activity of a promoted catalyst drops to that of an unpromoted catalyst. A possible explanation is the existence of two types of active sites, one created by the promoter and one created by propene itself. On a 12 wt.% RegOy/AlgOs catalyst this is not unreasonable, since the promoter is added in a Re:Sn=4:l atomic ratio, which means that if every molecule of promoter reacts with one rhenium atom, 75% of the rhenium still has not 232 reacted. Apparently, the active site created by the promoter is less stable. Both active sites must, however, consist of metal-carbenes. Why is one site more stable than the other? A tentative explanation based on the assumption that a reductive elimination is the cause of the deactivation can be given. It is thought that the activation energy of a reductive elimination is influenced by the oxidation state of the metal ion and the number and size of the ligands [23]. A high formal charge on the metal seems to favor a reductive elimination. In the reaction between the promoter and the rhenium (see next paragraph) no reduction takes place, and a bulky ligand is attached to the rhenium; both favor a reductive elimination. This bulky ligand is certainly not present on the active sites of unpromoted catalysts and the oxidation state is not yet known. Mechanism/or the reaction between SnR^ and Re-f)-, /Al^Oy In Figs. 7 and 8 it can be seen that all the promoted catalysts show two peaks in TPO, with a peak maximum at 535 K and 753 K, respectively, which are proportional to the lengths of the alkyi groups attached to the promoter metal. The position of the lower temperature peak depends on whether a Sn- or Pb-containing promoter was used. Therefore the peak at 535 K on the catalysts promoted with SnR4 can be interpreted as originating from a carbon source attached to the metal of the promoter. The peak at 753 K, then, originates from a carbon source not attached to the promoter, possibly to rhenium. Taking the relatively high temperature of the peak at 535 K into consideration and the fact that its position is not changed by the type of alkyi group in the promoter, it is likely that the tin is bonded to surface rhenium. If the peak at 535 K in Fig. 7, as proposed above, were due to the oxidation of the promoter, then some oxygen would have been consumed for the oxidation of Sn to SnOg. This gives an oxygen consumption peak in the TPO pattern, but also results in a weight increase of the catalyst if the SnOa remains behind on the surface. This may then result in no net weight loss and could explain the absence of the 535 K peak in DTG in the case of promoters with a low carbon to tin ratio (TMT, TET) and the reduction in intensity in case of promoters with a high carbon to tin ratio (TBT, TOT) (Fig. 9). A second cause for the (partial) absence of this peak is the fact that the alkyi groups attached to tin produce a lot of water when they are oxidized, which results in little weight loss, while a large amount of oxygen is consumed. The effect on the size of the peak again depends on the carbon to tin ratio. Thus, from the TPO patterns the conclusion can be drawn that the promoter still has a number of the original carbon atoms bonded to the metal and that it is probably bonded to rhenium. This assumption is an agreement with results obtained by Maksimov et al. [24] who showed by means of Mossbauer spectroscopy that upon treatment of RegOy/AlgOs with TBT a tin species of general formula R4_^Sn(OM)n (n= 1, 2 or 3) is formed in which M is either tin or rhenium. From the TPO results it can also be 233 concluded that there is a carbon source bonded to rhenium that used to belong to the promoter. Bearing this in mind we propose Scheme 2 for the reaction between the promoter and the rhenium oxide. It is generally accepted that most of the rhenium in RegC^/AlgOs is present as monomeric ReC>4 tetrahedra, stabilized by the aluminium in the support [1, 25]. The cleavage of a carbon tin bond can occur either het- erolytically or homolytically [ 26 ]. The heterolytic reaction is usually dominated by electrophilic attack at carbon, although nucleophilic assistance may be provided at the tin centre. The homolytic cleavage might in this case take place after a Single Electron Transfer (SET) reaction. Both routes are schematically drawn in Scheme 2. Whatever the reaction mechanism, a species is formed that has three alkyi groups bonded to the promoter metal and one to rhenium. This corresponds well with the relative intensities of the TPO peaks at 535 K and 753 K and with the shift in the 535 K peak when we compare tin TPO patterns with lead TPO patterns. Herrmann et al. [27] showed that after treating unsupported RegOy with Sn(CHa)4 both CHaReOg and Re04SnCCHg)3 can be isolated. No reduction takes place, even when excess Sn(CH3)4 is used. However, they did not isolate a species having both an OSn(CH3)3 and a CHa group attached to the rhenium. The main difference between their experiments and ours is that we used a true metathesis catalyst which does not contain Rea07 but, rather, stabilized ReC>4 tetrahedra. Whether a reduction of rhenium takes place in our system is not sure. The colour change of the catalyst (white to brown) when it comes in contact with the promoter might be caused by reduction. However, TPO experiments gave no indication for this. 0 'S\"^ 0^0\\ -0- SnR, ^ -0- Scheme 2. 234 If the carbon source bonded to rhenium were a carbene, all carbenes would have lost their identity after reaction with propene and the relation between the length of the carbon chain bonded to the original promoter and the high temperature peak in the TPO pattern would not have been found, Since the TPO patterns suggest that for the majority of the Re-Sn species this relation does exist, one can only conclude that the major part of the tin does not generate carbenes, or that all tin generates carbenes but that part of them are not catalytically active. The mechanism by which carbenes are formed from the species presented in Scheme 2 and the role of the support in this process is presently under investigation. Conclusions The influence of the type of support on the relationship between metathesis activity and rhenium oxide loading can be related to the number and the Bronsted acidity of the hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support. The high Bronsted acidity of certain hydroxyl groups is due to the local strong electron-withdrawing properties of the support. When such a hydroxyl group is replaced by ReC>4 then this species can be the precursor of an active metal carbene. The main cause of deactivation of a promoted metathesis catalyst is probably a reductive elimination of the metallacyclobutane intermediate, which is strongly temperature dependent. The lifetime of the catalyst can be extended by working at low reaction temperatures and by adding the promoter over a large time span. A mechanism for the reaction between rhenium oxide and a tetraalkyltin compound is given, in which monoalkylation of the rhenium occurs.

Mol ∗ Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Amsterdam, Nieuwe Achtergracht 166, 1018 WV AmsterdamThe Netherlands * Author to whom correspondence should be addressed The stability of supported Re2O7 metathesis catalysts during the metathesis of propene has been studied in a micro catalytic flow reactor. Promoting the metathesis catalysts with alkyltin compounds led to a large increase in activity, but the stability of the catalyst decreased considerably. The stability of the catalysts appeared to be influenced to a large degree by the choice of support: a 3 wt.% Re2O7/SiO2·Al2O3 catalyst promoted with tetraethyltin proved to be much more stable than a corresponding γ-alumina-supported one. However, the stability of an alumina-supported catalyst can be improved by increasing its rhenium content: a Re2O7/Al2O3 catalyst containing 12 wt.% Re2O7 turned out to be the most stable. This is not the case for catalysts on silica-alumina. This can be explained on the basis of the different types of hydroxyl groups of the support that can react with ReO4 − ions. The use of a γ-alumina guard bed in the reactor can increase the stability of a 12 wt.% Re2O7/Al2O3 catalyst. This is probably not only due to purification of the feed but also to the gradual release of the promoter from the guard bed onto which it was originally adsorbed. Besides the poisoning of the catalyst, which occurs due to impurities in the feed, an intrinsic deactivation mechanism is also present. This deactivation mechanism is strongly temperature dependent: the lower the reaction temperature the more stable the system. It could be shown by means of temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO), differential thermogravimetry (DTG) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) that the promoter is bonded to the catalyst and that regeneration of a spent catalyst results in formation of SnO2 which remains behind on the catalyst surface. A mechanism is proposed for the first alkylation by the promoter of the oxidic catalyst, in which the tin atom of the promoter becomes bonded to rhenium via an oxygen bridge. References 1 J.A.
