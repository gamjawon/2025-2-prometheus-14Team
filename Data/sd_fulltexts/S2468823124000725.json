Cobalt carbides demonstrate higher selectivity towards light olefins and alcohols in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS). In this study, we present an investigation of a series of supported cobalt catalysts that were carburized with CO for different time. The presence of Co3CCo, Co and Co2CCo phases in these catalysts was confirmed through Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The Co/SiO2-RC-0.5 h catalyst with both Co3C and Co structure exhibits the highest CO conversion for the FTS reaction. By utilizing the chemisorption techniques, we studied the structure-performance relationships between the phase and activity, and confirmed that Co3C has the highest intrinsic activity, which is beneficial for CO activation. This study provides further insight into the positive effects of Co3C on the FTS reaction and guides us in the rational design of high active Co-based FTS catalysts.

Introduction In recent years, the challenges of depleting crude oil reserves and the increasing energy demand due to economic development have become increasing apparent. This has created an urgent imperative to explore alternative approaches for the production of clean liquid fuels and chemicals [1–3]. The Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) technology provides an effective pathway for the production of high-value-added chemicals through the conversion of syngas (a mixture of CO and H2) derived from coal, biomass, and natural gas [4–7]. Among the various FTS catalysts, cobalt-based catalysts have emerged as one of the most suitable candidates due to their excellent catalytic activity, superior stability, remarkable selectivity towards long-chain hydrocarbons, and low water-gas shift activity [5,7-10]. During the reaction process, various phases can be present in the catalysts, including metallic cobalt (Co) [5,7], cobalt oxide (Co3O4 or CoO) [11,12], cobalt carbide (Co2C or Co3C) [13–17] and others [18]. According to the conventional views, metallic Co is considered as the active phase, and it is believed that hexagonal close-packed (HCP) metallic cobalt exhibits a higher activity compared to face-centered cubic (FCC) metallic cobalt [19–22]. However, the formation of cobalt carbides and their role in the FTS reaction is a controversial topic. For a long time, cobalt carbide has been regarded as an inactive phase during the FTS reaction process [23,24]. Recent studies and discoveries have challenged the role of cobalt carbides as inactive phase. Ding and co-workers reported that Co2C and the interface with metal Co were found to be beneficial for the production of alcohols [25–27]. Very recently, Zhong et al. found that Co2C nanoprisms including exposed (101) and (020) facets manifested a high selectivity to lower olefins with 60.8 % in the FTS reaction [14]. In addition, Liu et al. discovered that Co3C (101) can enhance the selectivity of light olefins by suppressing hydrogenation and the Co/Co3C interface further facilitated the CO dissociation and the formation of light olefins [16,28]. These findings indicate that cobalt carbides not only enhance the catalytic activity of catalysts but also exhibited high selectivity towards the high-value-added products, including high alpha-alcohols and light olefins. Very recently, we have discovered that catalysts with different phase compositions can be prepared by adjusting carburization time in Co-based Fischer-Tropsch synthesis [17]. The Co-Co3C catalyst exhibited a higher catalytic activity with 38 % CO conversion, while the Co-Co2C catalyst exhibited the lowest catalytic activity, as compared with metallic Co catalyst. By the combination of experimental and theoretical calculations, we demonstrated that Co3C is more active towards CO activation than Co and Co2C, resulting in a higher CO conversion of Co-Co3C catalyst. Despite the Co-Co3C catalyst exhibiting a higher CO conversion, it is still unable to meet the industrial application requirements due to the absence of a support. The supported catalysts are widely utilized to enhance catalysts stability and promote the dispersion of the active phase in Fischer-Tropsch reactions. The common supports usually employed include alumina, titania, silica (SiO2), zeolites, and carbon-based materials [29–34]. Among these various supports, SiO2 is widely recognized as an excellent catalyst support due to the suitable metal-support interactions [35–37]. Bartholomew et al. demonstrated that Co/SiO2 catalyst exhibited high catalytic activity (per surface Co atom) [38]. Recently, the Co3O4/SiO2 catalysts was synthesized by an in-situ soaking method to add SiO2 into cobalt precursors, which showed much high FTS activity and excellent stability than that of ex-soaking Co3O4/SiO2 catalysts [35]. Although there have been many reports demonstrating that the introduction of SiO2 can enhance the catalytic activity of Co/SiO2 catalysts, the effects of SiO2 on Co-CoxC catalysts (x = 2, 3) is still not well established for FTS reaction. Therefore, our research focused on exploring the effects of CO3C on the catalytic performance over the Co/SiO2 catalysts for FTS reaction. On the basis of our previous investigations, a series of catalysts with different phases were prepared through the carbonization of Co/SiO2 for different time. Compared with unsupported catalysts, the catalytic activity of supported catalysts is significantly enhanced. In addition, the activity order of the supported catalysts is as follows: Co-Co3C/SiO2 > Co/SiO2 > Co-Co2C/SiO2. The detailed characterization techniques were applied to investigate the intrinsic structure-activity relationship on Co-Co3C/SiO2 catalyst. This study provides a fundamental understanding toward the function of the supported cobalt carbide and guide us to rational design the effective cobalt catalysts for FTS. Experimental Reagents Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate [Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 99.9 %], Ethanol (C2H5OH, 99.9 %) Silicon dioxide (SiO2) were purchased from Sinopharm chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All chemicals were used as received without further purification. Catalysts preparation Co3O4/SiO2 was synthesized by the conventional incipient wetness co-impregnation method. In a typical procedure, 9 g Co(NO3)2·6H2O was dissolved to 20 g ethanol to form a cobalt nitrate solution. Then the SiO2 support was added into the prepared solution. The mixture was exposed to the air at 25 °C for 24 h, and dried at 120 °C for 6 h. After drying, the sample was transferred to a muffle furnace and calcinated at 450 °C for 4 h. The Co3O4/SiO2 sample had the 15 wt% Co loadings. Finally, the samples were pressed, crushed, and sieve into fine particles through a 20–40 mesh. After the Co3O4/SiO2 precursor preparation, the carburization pretreatments of Co3O4/SiO2 precursor were conducted. Firstly, the Co3O4/SiO2 precursor was reduced in a quartz tube at 350 °C for 4 h in pure H2 (GHSV = 6000 mL gcat −1 h−1). This reduced catalyst was labeled as Co/SiO2-R. Subsequently, the reduced catalyst was carburized at 250 °C for different durations (0.5 h or 2 h) in a pure CO flow (GHSV = 6000 mL gcat −1 h−1). The carburized catalysts were labeled as Co/SiO2-RC-0.5 h and Co/SiO2-RC-2 h, respectively. After the pretreatments, the catalysts were protected using absolute ethanol for further characterization. Catalysts characterization X-ray diffraction and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer XRD pattern of the catalysts were collected on X-ray diffractometer (Bruker, Germany) with Co Kα radiation at 35 kV and 40 mA. The scan rate of samples was set 4.8°/min from 20° to 80°. The actual Co content of all the samples was determined using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) with a PerkinElmer Optima-2100DV. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were performed on a FEI Quanta 400 field-emission scanning electron microscope. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a FEI Talos F200A electron microscope at 200 kV accelerating voltage. Before the measurements, the catalysts powder was dispersed in ethanol under sonication for 30 min. The resulting suspended powder was dropped on a copper grid covered with carbon film. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiment was conducted using a Thermal Scientific K-alpha instrument with Al Kα (hν = 1486.6 eV) as X-ray source. The C1s peak of adventitious carbon at 284.8 eV was used as the reference energy for charge calibration. CO pulse experiments CO pulse experiments were carried out to confirm the amounts of active sites (Micromeritics ASAP 2920, America). Firstly, about 200 mg catalyst was reduced at 350 °C for 4 h in pure H2 and then cooled down to room temperature in a U-type tube reactor. Then the flow was switched to CO and the catalyst was carburized at 250 °C for different time. Afterwards, the flow was switched to Ar until the reactor was cooled down to 50 °C for the pulse experiments. The 5 % CO/He gas mixture (50 mL min−1) was pulsed into the reactor via a dosing loop. The exit gas flow was detected with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Catalyst performance FTS reactions were performed in a fixed-bed stainless-steel tubular reactor (inner diameter, 10 mm) with 2 g catalyst (20–40 mesh) diluted with 2 g quartz sand (20–40 mesh). Before the reaction, the catalysts were in situ reduced at 350 °C for 4 h in a flow of pure H2 (50 mL min−1). Subsequently, the reduced catalysts were in situ carburized at 250 °C for different times in a stream of pure CO (50 mL min−1). Afterwards, the reactor was cooled down to 120 °C, and the gas was switched to syngas (H2/CO = 2). The FTS reactions were investigated in a stream of syngas (H2/CO = 2) with a flow rate of 5000 mL gcat −1 h−1 at 220 °C and 2 MPa. The effluent gas was detected online using Agilent 4890D and 6890 N gas chromatography equipped with two sampling loops. In one sampling loop, the hydrocarbons flowed through an Al2O3 capillary column and were analyzed with a flame ionization detector (FID). In the other loop, H2, N2, CO, CH4, and CO2 flowed through a column packed with Porapak Q stainless steel, a PLOT Q and 5A molecular sieve, and analyzed with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The oil, water, and wax of the products were collected every day to calculate the mass balance. Results and discussion Textural properties The Co loadings was confirmed by ICP methods. All three catalysts had the Co loadings with around 15 wt%, and the results were shown in Table S1. The textural and structural properties of different catalysts were investigated by N2 physisorption, including specific surface area, pore volume and average pore radius. From Table 1 , it is shown that the BET surface area of Co/SiO2-R catalyst increased from 115.4 to 130.4 and 133.6 m2 g−1 after carburization. This may indicate that the catalysts surface becomes rougher after carburization. In addition, the specific surface area of supported catalysts was larger than that of unsupported catalysts in our previous works [17]. The larger specific surface area can enhance the dispersion of active sites, to further improve the catalytic activity. Phase and structure properties XRD measurements can effectively provide the information on the phase and structure of catalysts. Therefore, XRD was performed on the oxidized, reduced, and carburized catalysts, and the results are shown in Fig. 1 . For the Co3O4/SiO2 catalyst, the peaks at 22.1°, 36.5°, 43.1°, 45.1°, 52.5°, 57.7°, 65.7°, 70.2° and 77.5° can be attributed to Co3O4(111), (220), (311), (222), (400), (331), (422), (511), and (440) lattice planes (Co3O4 PDF#43–1003), and the broad diffraction peaks at 25° corresponds to SiO2 support. After the oxidized catalyst was reduced and carburized, the Co3O4 diffraction peaks completely disappeared. For the reduced Co/SiO2 catalyst, the typical diffraction peaks at 48.8 and 55.9° can be ascribed to hcp Co(100) and (101) lattice planes (hcp Co PDF#05–0727), and the peak at 60.6° can be assigned to fcc Co(200) lattice plane (fcc Co PDF#15–0806). The highest intensity peak at 52° can be classified as the overlap peaks of hcp Co(002) at 52.5°and fcc Co(111) at 51.8°. For the Co/SiO2-RC-0.5 h catalyst, the diffraction peaks showed no obvious change compared with reduced catalyst. Due to the limitation of detection in XRD measurements, the cobalt carbide species in catalysts may not be detected. Previously, we utilized XPS depth profile analysis to confirm the existence of Co3C in the catalysts [39]. After carburization for 2 h, a typical diffraction peak for Co2C appeared at 50.1° (Co2C PDF#05–0704). This indicated that prolonged carburization can lead to the generation of Co2C, which is consistent with the previous reports [15]. Chemical and electronic properties XPS experiments were carried out to investigate the surface and phase composition of the Co/SiO2-RC-0.5 h catalyst. As shown in Fig. 1(c), the C1s spectrum of the Co/SiO2-R catalyst can be fitted into two peaks located at 284.8 and 286.4 eV, which can be attributed to C–C species and CO species, respectively. For the spectrum of Co/SiO2-RC-0.5 h catalyst, a new peak appeared at 282.5 eV, which can be attributed to Co–C species (atomic C). However, it is difficult to distinguish between Co2C and Co3C. In our previous reports, we observed the existence of Co3C in the unsupported catalyst by utilizing TEM technique [17]. Therefore, we employed the TEM characterization technique to confirm the structure of the Co/SiO2-RC-0.5 h subsequently. Structure properties In order to further confirm the structure of Co/SiO2-RC-0.5 h catalyst, (HR)TEM measurement was conducted as shown in Fig. 2 . The lattice distance of 2.13 Å displayed in Fig. 2(a) can be assigned to the (012) plane of Co3C. In addition, fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis was performed on the selected area in Fig. 2(a), and the result is shown in Fig. 2(b). There are three pairs of diffraction patterns, which can match well to the standard patterns of Co3C at the [100] zone axis. This confirms the existence of Co3C structure in the Co/SiO2-RC-0.5 h catalyst. Therefore, the Co/SiO2-RC-0.5 h catalyst which mainly consists of Co and Co3C was synthesized after 0.5 h carbonization as revealed by the multiple characterization methods. Catalytic performance All three supported catalysts were evaluated to determine the effect of the phase composition on the catalytic performance over the Co/SiO2 catalysts. Firstly, the space velocity of 2000 mL gcat −1h−1 was used, which is the same as the reaction conditions of the unsupported catalysts. Table S2 displays the activity and product selectivity for the stabilization of different catalysts. Under the low space velocity conditions, the CO conversion reaches over 75 % of all three catalysts. It is difficult to distinguish the differences in the activities. Therefore, the FTS performance was evaluated under the conditions of 2 MPa syngas with a higher space velocity of 5000 mL gcat −1h−1. The activity and product selectivity after 9 h reaction are presented in Table 2 . The Co/SiO2-RC-0.5 h catalyst exhibited the highest CO conversion of 48 % compared with Co/SiO2-RC-2 h catalyst (16 %) and Co/SiO2-R catalyst (40 %). The activity on the basis of the cobalt space-time yield (CTY) exhibited a similar trend as follows: Co/SiO2-RC-0.5 h > Co/SiO2-R > Co/SiO2-RC-2 h. Furthermore, the Co/SiO2-RC-0.5 h catalyst exhibited a desirable product distribution with the CH4 selectivity of 11 % and C5+ selectivity of 82 %. The CH4 selectivity for the Co/SiO2-R catalyst is 13 %, while the Co/SiO2-RC-2 h catalyst increased to 38 %. The C5+ selectivity is 84 % and 45 % with the Co/SiO2-R catalyst and Co/SiO2-RC-2 h catalyst respectively. The CO conversion and product selectivity as a function of time on stream are presented in Fig. 3 . All three catalysts keep a stable catalytic performance after reaction 10 h. In our previous work, the CO conversion of unsupported catalysts decreased during the reaction due to the particle aggregation. However, in this study, the particles dispersed well on the catalyst surface, which is responsible for catalysts stability. Structure and activity relationships In addition, the relationship between the structure and activity was investigated as well. Based on our experimental and computational studies of the unsupported catalysts [17], the presence of Co3C phase has been found to be beneficial for the CO activation, resulting in a higher intrinsic activity. Therefore, a series of CO pulse experiments were conducted to evaluate the number of active sites on the supported catalysts. As depicted in Fig. 4 , the intensity of remained CO in exit gas reached maximum after 42 min, 30 min and 12 min for Co/SiO2-R catalyst, Co/SiO2-RC-0.5 h catalyst and Co/SiO2-RC-2 h catalyst, respectively. As shown in Table 3 , the quantity of CO adsorption decreased from 0.5 to 0.2 mL g−1. The specific number of active sites was calculated based on the quantity of CO. Under the assumption that there is a 1:1 stoichiometry between the quantity of adsorbed CO and the number of active sites. The number of active sites decreased from 2.5 × 10−5 to 1.0 × 10−5 mol gcat −1 as the carburization time was prolonged. However, the Co/SiO2-RC-0.5 h catalyst exhibited the highest TOF with 2.0 h−1, followed by Co/SiO2-R catalyst with 1.4 h−1, and Co/SiO2-RC-2 h catalyst exhibited the lowest TOF with 1.3 h−1. This is consistent with the catalytic performance, indicating that Co3C phase on supported Co-based catalysts exhibits a higher intrinsic activity compared to metallic Co and Co2C phase. Based on the results of this study and the DFT calculations from our previous work on unsupported catalysts, it is reasonable to conclude that Co3C exhibits higher activity for CO activation, leading to a higher CO conversion on the supported catalysts [17]. Discussion For a considerable period of time in the past, the role of cobalt carbides in the FTS reaction has been consistently controversial. Recent studies have shown that cobalt carbides (especially Co2C) exhibit a high selectivity towards olefins and alcohols [14,27,40]. In our previous study, we found that Co3C exhibits higher activity compared to Co and Co2C on unsupported catalysts [17]. By utilizing the same procedure, a series of carburized supported catalysts were synthesized and evaluated for FTS reaction. Additionally, we were able to capture the transition phase of Co3C on the Co/SiO2-RC-0.5 h catalyst. It has been found that the supported catalyst containing Co3C exhibits higher activity in the FTS reaction, which is consistent with the results of unsupported catalyst. In our previous study, we found that the higher activity of Co/0.5h-CO catalyst can be attributed to the high intrinsic activity of Co3C, rather than the more quantity of active sites. In this study, we dispersed cobalt carbide on the SiO2 support, the Co/SiO2-RC-0.5 h catalyst with Co3C similarly does not exhibit the highest number of active sites by CO pulse experiments. The intrinsic activity of carburized catalysts was calculated and expressed via TOF. The results indicated that Co3C exhibited the highest intrinsic activity, which is responsible for the highest CO conversion in the FTS reaction. Combining the results of unsupported and supported catalysts over the cobalt carbide-based FTS reaction, Co3C may be a hidden gem and it brings us numerous surprises on exploring the role of cobalt carbides in the FTS. Conclusion In this study, we investigated the effects of carburization treatment on Co/SiO2 catalysts in FTS reaction. As the carburized time was prolonged, the phase composition of the catalysts evolved from metallic Co to Co3C to Co2C. The Co/SiO2-RC-0.5 h catalyst with Co3C exhibited the highest activity. Using CO chemisorption techniques, we found that the higher intrinsic activity of Co3C is responsible for the high CO conversion of Co/SiO2-RC-0.5 h catalyst in FTS reaction. Our study presents a reasonable route for designing highly active cobalt carbide catalysts for FTS reaction.

        "dc:description": "Cobalt carbides demonstrate higher selectivity towards light olefins and alcohols in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS). In this study, we present an investigation of a series of supported cobalt catalysts that were carburized with CO for different time. The presence of Co3CCo, Co and Co2CCo phases in these catalysts was confirmed through Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The Co/SiO2-RC-0.5 h catalyst with both Co3C and Co structure exhibits the highest CO conversion for the FTS reaction. By utilizing the chemisorption techniques, we studied the structure-performance relationships between the phase and activity, and confirmed that Co3C has the highest intrinsic activity, which is beneficial for CO activation. This study provides further insight into the positive effects of Co3C on the FTS reaction and guides us in the rational design of high active Co-based FTS catalysts.",
