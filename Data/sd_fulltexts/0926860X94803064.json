Introduction Composite catalysts based on CaO as main constituent to which an oxide, hydrox- ide or salt of sodium is admixed show high C2 + selectivity in the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) [ 1,2]. It was found that the composition of this type of catalysts, especially the amount of surface sodium promqter and, to a lesser degree, different salts used, affect the catalytic performance [3 ]. It is known that the introduction of a sodium compound into the CaO lattice leads to an increase in basicity which * Corresponding author. on leave from Institute of Energochemistry of Coal and Physical Chemistry of Sorbents, University of Mining and Metallurgy, 30-059 Krakow, Poland. 0926-860X/94/$07.00 SSDI O926-860X ( 94 )O0188-X L104 Teresa Grzybek, Manfred Baerns /Applied Catalysis A: Genera1118 (1994) LlO3-L110 plays an important role in the formation of C2 hydrocarbons from methane [4]. The aim of this note is to elucidate the effect of introducing small amounts of zinc nitrate, i.e., Zn2cations, onto the surface of a NaOH (11 mol-%)-CaO catalyst on C2+ selectivity in the OCM reaction. An attempt is made to correlate the observed increase in C2 + selectivity ~to the surface composition of the catalyst. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts Calcium oxide was first impregnated with an aqueous solution of sodium hydrox- ide using the incipient wetness technique. Then, the solid material was dried at 393 K in air for ca. 16 h. Subsequently, the sample was impregnated with an aqueous solution of zinc nitrate in the same manner resulting in overall loadings of 1, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.001 or 0.0001 mol-% of zinc nitrate (Merck, purity grade 98.5%); finally, the catalyst precursor was dried under the above-mentioned conditions. For comparison, catalysts containing no sodium were prepared by impregnating cal- cium oxide with zinc nitrate solutions resulting in overall loadings of 0.0001 and 0.01 mol-% of zinc nitrate. Before calcination the catalyst precursors were either sieved (designation A) or first pelletized and then crushed and sieved (designation B); calcination was carried out at 1023 K in nitrogen for ca. 16 h. 2.2. Catalytic experiments The OCM reaction was carried out in a quartz-made reactor at 1023 K applying a methane-to-oxygen ratio of 8.7 to 10 at a total pressure of ca. 101 kPa (nitrogen used as a diluent, its partial pressure was ca. 22 kPa). A gas flow of 50 ml min- was passed through a fixed bed of 500 mg of catalyst (dp= 0.5 to 0.7 mm). 2.3. Surface analysis of the catalysts Surface analysis of the catalytic materials was performed in most cases after drying, calcination and the OCM reaction (Leybold spectrometer LH 10 applying a Mg Ka source; an AI Ka source could not be used since there would be a secondary oxygen peak overlapping with the Zn 2p3/2 peak). Unfortunately, it is not possible to differentiate between metallic zinc and the zinc cation (Zn+ 2) using the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) binding energy (see Section 3.1.); also the so- called Auger parameter (see Section 3.1.) could not be used since it was not measurable because the Na Auger (KLz3L23) and Zn Auger (L3M45M45) peaks overlapped. The XPS spectra were smoothed and satellites due to the non-mono- chromatic X-ray source were eliminated. A non-linear background was subtracted in the case of the Na 1 s, O 1 s, Ca 2p and C 1 s peaks and a linear background in the Teresa Grzybek, Manfred Baerns /Applied Catalysis A: General 118 (1994) L103-L110 L105 case of Zn 2p peaks. The use of the non-linear background subtraction did not change the binding energy of the Zn 2p peaks by more than + 0.1 eV. Calculation of the surface composition was based on the Na Is, Ca 2p, O Is, C ls and Zn 2p3/ 2 peaks and sensitivity factors of Wagner et al. [ 5 ]. The binding energies were calibrated using the Ca 2p3/2 peak (346.5 eV) as an intemal standard because the C ls contamination peak (284.7 eV) was in most cases too small and therefore unreliable. 3. Results and discussion First, surface composition of the catalysts and secondly, its effect on C2+ selec- tivity is described and discussed. 3.1. Surface composition XPS spectra of Zn-doped NaOH-CaO catalysts showed peaks of Na 1 s, O 1 s, Ca 2p and C 1 s at binding energies similar to those observed for the NaOH-CaO catalyst itself [ 3 ]. The surface Na-to-Ca ratio was not influenced by the presence of minor amounts of zinc. Typical Zn 2p peaks are shown for catalysts doped with 1, 0.1, 0.01 and 0.0001 mol-% of Zn in Fig. 1; the spectra of the catalysts containing 0.05 and 0.001 mol-% Zn were qualitatively similar to those for 0.01 and 0.0001 mol-% Zn and are therefore omitted.

CNa+Ca+Zn = 100at.-%. Below detection level. 2pl/2 peaks and the surface zinc content (Zn+Ca+Na = 100 at.-%) for the various catalysts studied are given in Table 1. Significant differences in the binding energies of the Zn 2p3/z peaks occur for the various solid samples (see Table 1 and Fig. 1) and can be grouped as follows: (a) binding energies of ca. 1018.5 to 1019.5 eV were observed for NaOH-CaO catalysts doped with 0.0001 to 0.05 mol-% of zinc nitrate after drying, as well as after calcination and after exposition to the OCM reaction and for the Zn (0.0001%)-CaO catalyst (without NaOH) after drying; (b) binding energies of 1021.6 only occur for Zn( 1 mol-%)-NaOH--CaO catalyst after drying and calcination; (c) binding energies of 1018.8 +0.5 eV and 1021.6 +0.3 eV were observed for the Zn(0.1 moI-%)-NaOH-CaO catalyst after all treatment conditions, and Teresa Grzybek, Manfred Baerns /Applied Catalysis A: General 118 (1994) L103-L110 L107 (d) in all instances when a negative BE shift of the Zn 2p3/2 peak was observed, a similar shift occurred for the Zn 2pl/2 peak. The Zn 2p3/2 binding energies are reported to be 1021.7_ 0.3 eV for Znand 1021.8 +0.3 eV for ZnO [6]; thus no distinction between metallic zinc and zinc oxide is possible on the basis of the Zn 2p3/2 peak. There would be a fairly large difference in the Auger parameter of zinc (the sum of energies of Zn 2p3/2 peak and of the L3MasM45 Zn peak); however, this Auger peak is too small to be registered and additionally, the Auger peaks of sodium KL23L23 (which is fairly large) and of zinc overlap. According to Dake et al. [6] different zinc compounds show no binding energies with values lower than metallic zinc; the data do not contain, however, sodium zincate to which the shift might be ascribed but this proposition appears to be rather unlikely. If the lower binding energy would be exclusively related to zincate formation, it should be the same for all zinc-doped catalysts but it should not be observed for the dried zinc-doped catalyst containing no sodium. The observed negative shift of the binding energy might be explained as follows. For metallic species on a support, both, positive and negative shifts of the binding energies have been observed. They are generally believed to originate from small clusters of promoters, surface atoms, electron transfer processes and/ or promoter-support interactions. Positive binding energy shifts are usually found for small clusters of atoms or matrix isolated atoms [7-10] and in some cases also for cations [ 11 ]. Therefore, it may be excluded that ZnO forms small clusters on CaO or NaOH-CaO surfaces of the present catalysts doped with minor amounts of zinc not higher than 0.05 mol-%. Negative shifts of the binding energy were explained by either charge transfer [ 12-15], or energy changes of surface atoms [ 9,16 ] or incorporation of atoms into the lattices of another compound [ 17,18 ]. The formation of Zn2+ clusters can be excluded and any electron charge transfer between Zn2+ and NaOH--CaO seems improbable because this solid material is not reducible and the effect is observed for all the samples, i.e., dried, calcined and exposed to the OCM reaction. Hence, it may be assumed that Zn2+ is introduced into the surface lattice of CaO. This could be in agreement with observations for ZnO-CuO catalysts [ 17,18] where a shift of the binding energy of - 1.7 eV was interpreted as Zn2+ existing as a supersaturated solid solution in a CuO-ZnO catalyst. For the sake of completeness it should be stated, however, that some authors [ 19] did not find Zn2+ forming solid solutions in their ZnO/CuO catalysts. Zn2 + does not form stoichiometric solid solutions in CaO or Ca(OH) 2, the ionic radii for Ca2+, Zn2+ and Zn+ being 0.99, 0.'~4 and 0.88 A, respectively. It can, however, be assumed that some Ca2+ cations of the surface lattice may be exchanged by Zn2 + cations, thus forming a kind of solid solution in the near-surface region. The amount of zinc introduced in this way should be very small. Higher amounts should lead to bigger ZnO clusters on the CaO surface and then the Zn peak should show a binding energy equal to that of bulk ZnO as is the case for the L108 Teresa Grzybek, Manfred Baerns /Applied Catalysis A: General 118 (1994) LIO3-Ll lO ZnO( 1 moI-%)-NaOH-CaO catalyst. The catalyst containing 0.1 mol-% of zinc shows both features. The effect of the observed binding energy shift is obviously related only to the CaO lattice since it was also observed for catalysts containing no sodium. Sodium, however, stabilizes Zn2 near the surface of the catalyst: the Zn2 peak disappears after calcination of Zn-doped CaO samples but stays unchanged for calcined and reacted samples containing sodium. The observed amount of surface zinc (on the average 0.7 at.-%, Na+Ca+Zn= 100 at.-%, see Table 1), indicates that all or almost all zinc is present in the near-surface region. (The escape depth of an electron for 200 eV as Na Is and Zn 2p kinetic energies is 2 monolayers and for 900 eV for Ca 2p electrons is 5 monolayers [20] ). 3.2. C2+ selectivity The selectivity of Zn-doped NaOH-CaO catalysts was related to the bulk content of zinc as is shown in Fig. 2. An increase in C2 + selectivity is observed for catalysts containing between 10-4 and 5.10-2 mol-% of zinc; the effect was independent of catalyst preparation (samples A or B). If zinc is not present in the near-surface region (e.g. Zn(0.01 mol-%) in CaO without NaOH, no change in C2+ selectivity was found in comparison to pure CaO. If one assumes that heterolytic splitting of the weakly acidic methane occurs on the highly basic surface, Zn2may act as an electron acceptor from the methyl anion forming Zn+ or Znas transitional states. Neutral methyl radicals could then easily escape to the gas phase where they would recombine to ethane. Adsorbed oxygen could be easily reduced by Zn+~ or Zn hereby its transformation into lattice oxygen would be facilitated. This phenomenon might also contribute to a rapid removal of adsorbed oxygen species from the surface which are assumed to be responsible for non-selective oxidation. In the reviewing procedure the question has been raised to what extent, apart from the overall C2 + selectivity, the product distribution is affected by zinc doping.

I So2+/% Fig. 3. Change in the selectivity ratio of ethane to ethylene and of C3+ selectivity as a function of total C2+ selectivity when affected by Zn doping. When C2 + selectivity increases due to doping, C3 + and ethylene selectivities are enhanced while the ratio of ethane to ethylene decreases (see Fig. 3) and ethane selectivity remains constant (39%). From these results it may be concluded that the consecutive total oxidation of ethylene is suppressed. These effects should be considered, however, as a general phenomenon for highly selective catalysts and not as a characteristic of the present situation. The CO2/CO ratio is independent of doping by zinc as long as it stays below 0.1 mol-%; it is constant within experimental accuracy and amounts to 28. In the case of a C2+ selectivity decrease due to excessive Zn doping (Zn > 0.1 mol-% ) the COJCO ratio, however, becomes about 52 which is ascribed to the total oxidation potential of ZnO clusters (see above). 4. Conclusions Incorporating reducible zinc cations from ZnO onto the near-surface lattice of a NaOH-CaO catalyst leads to an improvement of C2 selectivity as long as no ZnO clusters are formed on the surface. It may be assumed that Znz+ acts as an electron acceptor, facilitating electron transfer from a methyl anion formed by heterolytic splitting of weakly acidic methane whereby Znt + or Znsurface species are prob- ably formed as transitional states. To generalize this suggestion for other catalysts further experimental evidence is required. Acknowledgements This work has been partly supported by the European Community within the JOULE I Program.

        "dc:description": "ZnO added to a NaOH-CaO catalyst by the incipient wetness method affects C2 hydrocarbon selectivity in the oxidative coupling of methane. The zinc content was varied between 0.0001 and 1 mol-%. At concentrations from 0.0001 to 0.05 mol-% an increase in selectivity was observed as compared to the undoped catalysts. By X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of the catalyst surface a negative shift in binding energy of the Zn 2p3/2 peak in the range of enhanced selectivity was observed which is ascribed to an incorporation of zinc cations into the CaO surface lattice. The selectivity increase is supposed to be due to Zn2+ accepting electrons from CH− 3 formed by heterolytic splitting of methane and the subsequent reduction of adsorbed oxygen to O−2 lattice oxygen by electron transfer from Zn1+ or Zn0.",
