Tel.: +91 40 27191474; fax: +91 40 27193991. Efficient bromination of polyaniline base to poly(2-bromoaniline)-bromide is successfully carried out using bromodimethylsulfonium bromide. Poly(2-bromoaniline)-bromide salt was obtained in a dry amorphous nature, having high conductivity (2.5S/cm) with agglomerated spherical morphology. Poly(2-bromoaniline)-bromide salt was proved to be a novel, efficient, reusable, cheaper and eco-friendly polymer-based solid acid catalyst in the reaction between aromatic amines and N-vinyl lactam under solvent-free conditions to provide 2-methyl-4-anilino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolines. These 2,4-disubstituted tetrahydroquinolines were synthesized with trans selectivity. Graphical abstract Synthesized brominated polyaniline and acts as novel reusable polymeric catalyst in organic synthesis. This methodology is economic, very simple, green benign and energy efficient. InChIKey SJYFSJCPORTOHY-RTVQCLFWSA-N Keywords Polyaniline salt Reusable catalyst Green chemistry Tetrahydroquinoline Stereoselectivity 1 Introduction Polyaniline (PANI) is one of the most interesting conducting polymers due to its good environmental stability, interesting redox properties, optoelectronic features and controllable electrical and electrochemical properties [1]. As a result, many technological applications have been demonstrated with polyaniline in the development of sensors, rechargeable batteries, super capacitors, electrochromic materials, electromagnetic shielding, light emitting devices, photovoltaic materials, ESD, and corrosion-protecting coatings [2–5]. Despite the vast bibliography devoted to PANI, new studies focusing on the polymerization process are reported each year [6–9]. Recently, PANI has been receiving considerable attention for catalytic reactions as a catalyst and support owing to its highly conducting and redox properties [10]. Furthermore, its easy preparative protocol from non-expensive starting material (aniline), controllable doping levels through an acid doping/base dedoping process, and non-solubility in most organic solvents and water make it useful in heterogeneous catalysts. By exploiting these properties, polyaniline-based solid acid catalysts have been reported earlier by our group for various organic transformations [11]. The tetrahydroquinoline scaffold is a core structure in many biologically-active natural products and synthetic pharmaceutical agents. 2,4-Disubstituted tetrahydroquinolines have been synthesized by Batey and other groups' research, via 1:2 coupling of substituted anilines with vinyl ethers [12–16]. Our group very recently reported the synthesis of cis-2-methyl-4-substituted tetrahydroquinoline derivatives from the reaction of substituted aniline and N-vinyl lactam [17] using polyaniline-based solid acid catalysts. In 2010, Jia et al. reported for the first time the synthesis of 2-methyl-4-anilino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline derivatives [18] via a tandem cyclization of imine with its enamine isomer induced by the radical cation salt tris(4-bromophenyl)aminium hexachloroantimonate (TBPA+). However, the drawbacks of this method include the non-reusable, toxic, and expensive nature of the catalyst. In order to improve the synthetic methodology, a polyaniline salt is used as a cheaper, reusable and environmentally-friendly catalyst in the stereoselective synthesis of trans-2-methyl-4-anilino tetrahydroquinoline derivatives. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of poly(2-bromoaniline)-bromide salt (P2BrABr-I) using BDMS Bromodimethylsulfonium bromide (BDMS) [19] and polyaniline base [20] were prepared by following a procedure reported earlier [19,20]. Polyaniline base (0.5g) was added to 50mL of dichloromethane solution containing 0.5g BDMS and the mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 4h. The resultant mixture was filtered, washed with dichloromethane and then acetone until the filtrate is colorless and dried at 50°C until the weight is constant. 2.2 Preparation of poly(2-bromo aniline)-bromide salt using Br2 (P2BrABr-II) Polyaniline base (0.5g) was added to 50mL of dichloromethane solution containing 2.57mL of bromine and the mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 4h. The product was isolated by using the above procedure. 2.3 General procedure for P2BrABr salt-catalyzed domino tetrahydroquinoline synthesis A mixture of aromatic amine (2mmol), N-vinyl lactam (1mmol) and P2BrABr catalyst (14wt.% with respect to aromatic amine) under solvent-free conditions was stirred at 80°C for a particular period of time. Ethyl acetate was added to the reaction mixture. The catalyst was separated by simple filtration. Ethyl acetate solution was washed with water, followed by brine, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and concentrated. The products were isolated by column chromatography using silica gel (60–120mesh) and eluted with petroleum ether. All of the products were authenticated by 1H NMR and mass spectroscopy data [18,21,22]. The recyclability experiment was carried out using the recovered catalyst, wherein, the recovered catalyst was washed with acetone and dried in an oven at 50°C for 10min. 3 Results and discussion P2BrABr salt was prepared by oxidizing aniline using sodium persulfate oxidant in the presence of hydrochloric acid, followed by dedoping of polyaniline-hydrochloride salt (PANI-HCl) to polyaniline base (PANI) and subsequent doping with bromodimethylsulfonium bromide (BDMS) or bromine (Br2) to 2-bromopolyaniline-bromide salts, P2BrABr-I and P2BrABr-II respectively. 3.1 Physical properties of P2BrABr Bromination of polyaniline base using BDMS and Br2 yielded 0.7g and 0.85g (with respect to 0.5g of PANI base used) respectively. Conductivity of the P2BrABr-I prepared using BDMS (2.5S/cm) was found to be higher than that of the P2BrABr-II sample prepared using Br2 (0.2S/cm). This result indicates that the efficiency of bromination of polyaniline base is higher with the use of BDMS. Conductivity of P2BrABr is 12 orders of magnitude higher than that of PANI base (insulator level, <10−12 S/cm). Increase in conductivity result confirms that insulating PANI base is converted to doped PANI salt. The densities of P2BrABr-I and P2BrABr-II were found to be 1.5 and 1.7g/cm3, respectively, which are higher than that of PANI base (1.2 to 1.3g/cm3). This result is due to the presence of higher density bromine on the polyaniline system. In order to determine the amount of moisture present in the brominated polyaniline salt, the sample was heated at 100°C for 48h and weighed. The weight of the brominated polyaniline salt before and after heating was found to be almost the same. This result indicates that the brominated polyaniline salt does not have moisture compared to conventional polyaniline salt, which contains 5 to 8% moisture [23,24]. 3.2 Infrared spectra of P2BrABr Infrared spectra of P2BrABr-I, P2BrABr-II and dedoped P2BrABr-I are shown in (Fig. 1 ). The major characteristic peaks obtained from 2000 to 750cm−1 for the three polymer samples are reported in Table 1 . Infrared spectral peaks for P2BrABr-I are very similar to the infrared peaks reported in polyaniline salt [25]. Infrared spectral peaks of its corresponding base are nearly the same with that of the polyaniline base peaks reported in the literature [17] except the shifting of CN str. of the quinoid ring peak from 1310 to 1295cm−1. This is due to the presence of bromine in the ortho-position of the polyaniline base. The IR spectral peaks of P2BrABr-II consisted of polyaniline base peaks in addition to salt peaks (Table 1). This result indicates the lower efficiency of doping of bromine on the polyaniline system by bromination of polyaniline base with bromine. 3.3 XRD pattern of P2BrABr The X-ray diffraction pattern of conventionally synthesized semicrystalline polyaniline salts showed four clear peaks around 2θ=9.3, 15, 20–22, 25 and 27° [26–28]. In this work, the X-ray diffraction profile registered for P2BrABr-I (Fig. 2b) showed broad peaks around 2θ=7, 14 and 24° with corresponding d-spacing 12.1, 6.3 and 4.3 respectively, indicating less crystallinity. The X-ray diffraction pattern of P2BrABr-II (Fig. 2a) showed a broad peak around 2θ=25°, which indicates an amorphous nature for the polyaniline salt. The X-ray pattern of the dedoped P2BrABr-I sample showed a broad band around 2θ=25°, similar to that of P2BrABr-II. Recycled P2BrABr-I showed a broad peak around 2θ=21° representing an amorphous nature. 3.4 FE-SEM and EDAX of P2BrABr Morphologies of polyaniline samples are found out from field emission scanning electron microscopy. The SEM picture of brominated polyaniline base by BDMS (P2BrABr-I) showed aggregated nanofibers with spheres (Fig. 3a) and by bromination with bromine, morphology changed to agglomerated spheres (Fig. 3b). The SEM picture of dedoped P2BrABr-I showed nanospheres with a diameter of 55–105nm (Fig. 3c). The SEM picture of recycled P2BrABr-I also showed nanospheres with a diameter of 55–110nm (Fig. 3d). EDAX of polyaniline base brominated using BDMS, P2BrABr-I, showed 30wt.% of bromine and its corresponding dedoped polyaniline base showed 14wt.% of bromine. This result indicates that dedoped polyaniline base contains bromine due to the formation of poly(2-bromoaniline). Higher bromine weight percentage on polyaniline salt indicated that poly(2-bromoaniline) contains bromide dopant, i.e., formation of poly(2-bromoaniline)-bromide salt. 3.5 Synthesis of 2-methyl-4-anilino tetrahydroquinoline using P2BrABr catalyst In 2010, for the first time, Jia et al. carried out the above reaction by changing the stoichiometric amount of reactants as 2mmol aniline and 1mmol N-vinyl pyrrolidone, which gave the product, cis and trans isomers of 2-methyl-4-anilino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline [18]. In order to improve the methodology in terms of toxicity, and cheaper and reusable catalyst, we used polyaniline-based solid acid material as a catalyst in this work. We attempted out the reaction of aniline (2mmol) with N-vinyl pyrrolidone (1mmol) using an iodine-doped polyaniline catalyst. However, this reaction gave two products, cis isomer of 2-methyl-4-pyrrolidin-2-one-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline (20%) and mixtures of (trans & cis) isomers of 2-methyl-4-anilino tetrahydroquinoline (50%). A similar result was obtained with the use of a polyaniline-hydrochloride or polyaniline-sulfate salt catalyst. However, the use of poly(2-bromoaniline) salt gave a single product with major trans selectivity. Reaction of aniline (1mmol) with various amounts of N-vinyl pyrrolidone (2, 1.5, 0.7 and 0.5mmol) was carried out using a P2BrABr-I catalyst (14wt.% with respect to the amount of aniline) under solvent-free conditions at 80°C. The use of 2mmol of N-vinyl pyrrolidone gave 94% yield of the cis isomer of 2-methyl-4-substituted-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline. However, decreasing the amount of N-vinyl pyrrolidone from 2mmol to 1.5, the reaction gave a mixture of products, i.e., 66% of cis 2-methyl-4-substituted-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline and 34% of trans and cis isomers of 2-methyl-4-anilino tetrahydroquinoline (Scheme 1 ). On further decreasing the amount of N-vinyl pyrrolidone to 0.7 or 0.5mmol, the reaction gave only trans and cis isomers of 2-methyl-4-anilino tetrahydroquinoline. In a typical procedure, the reaction of aniline (2mmol) with N-vinyl pyrrolidone (1mmol) using a P2BrABr-I catalyst at 80°C under solvent-free conditions for 20min, gave the product of 2-methyl-4-anilino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline in 90% yield with 72% trans selectivity. The catalytic activity of P2BrABr-I is checked in different solvents. The use of solvents such as ethanol, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, and chloroform all allowed the formation of cis and trans isomers of 2-methyl-4-anilino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline. Tetrahydrofuran solvent gave higher yield of the product (70%) with 75% trans selectivity, acetonitrile (66%) with 67%, and ethanol (45%) with equal amounts of isomers. However, reaction did not proceed with the use of solvents such as toluene or water. In this reaction, the N-vinyl lactams such as N-vinyl pyrrolidone, N-vinyl lactam or N-vinyl carbazole are not only the dienophiles but also serve as precursors of acetaldehyde [17,29]. In order to determine the effect of catalyst, P2BrABr-I, the reaction was extended with various aromatic amines (2mmol) and N-vinyl lactams (1mmol) at 80°C under solvent-free condition and the results are reported in Table 2 . The reaction went smoothly in all of the cases with excellent yields (75–93%) and with major trans selectivity. 3.6 Recyclability Reusability of the P2BrABr-I catalyst was verified for the model reaction of aniline with N-vinyl pyrrolidone under solvent-free condition at 80°C for 20min. The reaction gave 72% selectivity of trans isomer with 90% yield. Reusability was checked by separating the catalyst from the reaction mixture by filtration followed by purification using acetone and used in the reaction again. This procedure was carried out for six cycles and provided the product in 90 (72), 89 (70), 90 (69), 91 (68), 87 (57) and 87 (52)%, respectively, with decreasing amounts of the trans isomer. After the recyclability experiment, the catalyst is analyzed by spectral analyses (Figs. 1–3) and similar results were obtained for the catalysts before and after the reaction. The above results indicate that the P2BrABr catalyst shows recyclability. 4 Conclusions Polyaniline base was successfully brominated using bromodimethylsulfonium bromide as bromine source. Poly(2-bromoaniline)-bromide salt was proved to be a cheap, efficient and recyclable catalyst for the synthesis of trans-2-methyl-4-anilino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline derivatives.
