F. Nalewajski, J. Korchowiec K. Guminski Department of Theoretical Chemistry, Jagiellonian University, R. Ingardena 3, 30 060 Cracow (Poland) R. Tokarz, E. Broclawik and M. Witko Institute of Catalysis and Surface Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, Niezapomincjek, 30 239 Cracow (Poland) (Received October 18, 1991; accepted May 13, 1992) Abstract The semiempirical charge sensitivity analysis in atomic resolution has been applied to the V206 clusters modelling active sites of vanadia catalysis, ranging from 1 to 15 pyramidal units, and to selected (n-V206)- - -HZ chenusorption systems. Both the atomic and normal population mode sensitivities are reported. In particular, it is shown that the atomic Fukui function distribution and the topology of the energetically most important normal modes provide adequate sensitivity and reactivity criteria leading to predictions supporting an earlier SCF MO description of the chemisorption/desorption processes on vanadia surfaces, which identified differences in catalytic functions of various types of oxygens on the surface. The influence of the shape and size of a cluster on the charge sensitivity data. has been examined in order to identify the smallest adequate active site representation. Introduction The detailed description and eventual understanding of processes occurring on surfaces of catalysts always requires combining reactivity information obtained from various experimental and theoretical sources. The theoretical treatments are particularly suitable for investigating elementary steps of hypothetical catalytic mechanisms. Besides the standard SCF MO approaches, the novel charge sensitivity analysis (CSA) [ 1-101 has recently been advocated as an attractive tool for identifying the controlling electronic factors influencing catalytic activities and selectivities [ 1 c, 6-81. This method can be applied at various levels of resolution and in alternative representations, thus exhibiting a high degree of flexibility suitable for describing various stages of catalytic processes. The vanadia catalysts have recently been the subject of numerous theoretical studies [ 11-151. Their importance follows from the wide range of industrial applications of the V205 based catalysts in the oxidation of hydrocarbons. Previous SCF MO (SINDO) studies [ 11, 12 ] have identified 0304-5102/92/$05.00 0 1992 - Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. All rights reserved 166 the active centre responsible for the hydrogen adsorption, modelling the first step of the overall process, and provided a basis for qualitative speculations concerning the successive steps of the oxidation reaction. More specifically, the differences between catalytic functions of crystallographically different oxygen atoms on model vanadia surfaces have been pointed out. However, in order to further verify these proposed mechanisms an independent model study would be required. This is the main purpose of the present paper, in which results of the CSA calculations are reported for a selection of vanadia clusters. The standard semiempirical CSA method in the atoms-in-molecules (AIM) resolution [1, 6] has been adopted, and calculations have been performed for the cluster geometrical parameters used in previous theoretical studies [11, 12]. Calculations Method As the theory has been described in detail elsewhere [ 1, 2 ], only the essential features and definitions will be summarized here. The semiempirical AIM CSA is based upon the canonical AIM hardness tensor, 77ij=a2ElWi aNj=aAilWj=a/ajlWi (1) where N= (Nl, NZ . . . ) is the AIM electron population vector, E(N) is the system electronic energy, and 1u = aE /W is the vector of the AIM chemical potentials. The hardness tensor can be approximated, for the specified AIM oxidation states, by the valence-shell electron-repulsion integrals, estimated from the atomic ionization potential and electron affinity data via. the familiar Pariser [ 16 ] and Ohno [ 17 ] formulas of the semiempirical SCF MO theories. Among many sensitivities of interest in the theory of chemical reactivity, the AIM Fukui function (FF) indices, fi=wilaiv (2) where N=YiNi is the system global number of electrons, are of special importance for investigating the charge transfer (CT) processes [1, 2, 5-10]. They represent local AIM electron population responses per unit change in N. It has been demonstrated elsewhere [ lb, 2b, 6 ] that deeper insight into the CT and/or polarization (P) processes can be achieved by examining the normal mode (decoupled) representation [lb, 2b, c, e, 6] corresponding to the eigenvectors of the hardness matrix, in which {77ij} becomes diagonal, 1hass = h saJ, UTnU = h, UL>T -1 (3) The principal hardnesses {ha} measure the `force constants' of the independent, collective displacements in the AIM electron populations. The diagonal elements, p, of the associated `charge-and-bond-order' matrix: 167 P = UTNU, {Nij -Ni 3ij} (4) group the normal-mode occupations, while the vector-like transformation of the AIM populations, v=NU, generates coordinates of the electron population vector, vY, with the coordinates N in the space of the AIM population reference frame, in the rotated, principal axes system [lb, 2b, c, e]. In the previous CSA of metallic clusters [61 the following probability quantity has been designed within the normal representation: wa=(alvlav )(avalaN)=XOUi,, Uj -1j\"Uj~ Fa-Xj'wO>0, 1awa=1 (5) where Fa= ava/W is the mode FF index associated with the normal population va. The quantity of eqn. (5) represents the relative ath mode contribution to the CT energy, and at the same time its AIM contribution, wj, measures the ath normal-mode contribution to the ith AIM FF index [lb]: w, = (aNi/ava)(ava/w (5a) The neutral oxygen and V(1 +) hardness parameters have been used in all calculations reported in the present study. The neutral vanadium hardnesses have led to charge instabilities (negative principal hardnesses) for larger clusters. Throughout the paper atomic units are used. Model clusters Vanadium oxides are among the most commonly used catalysts. In particular, vanadia compounds catalyze selective oxidation of hydrocarbons [ 18, 19 ]. The most studied systems in this context are vanadia monolayers, supported on titania [20-23], and solid solutions of M003 in VZOb. The crystals of these compounds may be thought of as composed of deformed VO6 'octahedra' or, in an idealized structure [11, 121, of regular square pyramids (shown in Fig. 1(a)) with the vanadium ion placed above the square plane of oxygens shared by the neighbouring pyramidal units. The vanadyl bond length is the same as in the real crystal structure, while the remaining V-O bonds in the pyramid are equal to the average bond lengths observed in the crystal [ 11, 12 ]. As seen in Fig. 1(b) the plane of the square base coincides with the (010) plane of the crystal. For a given 'octahedron' unit, there is a marked difference between the V-O bond lengths for bonds directed above and below (010) plane. In the pyramid-units visualization the longer bond connects pyramids belonging to different (010) layers, whereas the shorter (vanadyl) bond is included in the pyramid. As also seen in Fig. 1, there is an alternating pattern of such elongations along each layer, which leads to a pair of short and long V-O bonds separating two layers (Fig. 1(b)). When the crystal is cleaved the longer V-O bonds are broken, so the cleavage plane may be considered as consisting of VO6 pyramids. In the (010) cleavage plane such pyramids form zigzag-like chains, with each linear stretch of the zigzag consisting of two pyramids sharing an edge, one with the vanadyl oxygen atom above and the other with the vanadyl oxygen atom 168 (a) a, I II - --Q III 0 0~____ _ _ I i_~s ~ I 11 I V \"' '' ;I 0(z)ss Cs I_ __ I , ~ I I I I I I ~ I I 0(1) IV I o_ _ _ _a_ _I_ _nV d I i , I (b) Fig. 1.

The neighbouring chains are joined together by pairs of pyramids sharing a corner. Such a monolayer cut of the VZOb crystal represents a realistic model of the vanadia clusters on the surface; such idealized models with regular square pyramids have been used in previous SCF MO theoretical studies of vanadia catalysts [ 11, 12 ] and they are also adopted in the present sensitivity study. In Fig. 1(a) the small cluster models used in the present calculations are shown. They include models ranging from 1 to 15 VOb pyramids. The four-pyramid model, IV, is the smallest one exhibiting three different types of oxygen atoms: the vanadyl (terminal) 0(1) oxygens, coordinated to one vanadium atom, and the following two kinds of bridging oxygens: 0(2) and 0(3), coordinated to two and three metal ions, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1(a) the six-pyramid model, V, is the first one to exhibit in addition an empty square unit (without a metal ion). For this reason structure V has been used in hydrogen chemisorption calculations reported in this work. For the spec- 169 Va _' _ _ i H Vc ' _ i Fig. 2. The 2H-chemisorbed six-pyramid clusters with O-H bond length It(O-H)=0.9 A. ification of the 2H-chemisorbed structures the reader is referred to Fig. 2 (models Va-Vc). The three structures considered correspond to hydrogens being adsorbed, within a given model, above crystallographically identical oxygen atoms, with the H-H bond already broken. The Va, Vb and Vc models correspond to the hydrogen chemisorption on the vanadyl (0(1)), O(Z) and 0(3) oxygens, respectively. As usual in cluster analysis the problem of oxygens with unsaturated bonds (broken as the result of cutting the cluster out of an infinite surface) appears. In order to test how saturation of such dangling bonds affects the predicted charge sensitivities, additional test calculations have also been carried out for both bare and chemisorbed six-pyramid clusters, with all (010) plane terminal oxygens saturated by formation of the standard OH bonds. Results and discussion VaOia clusters In Fig. 3 we present the O FF distribution for all vanadia clusters in order to trace its evolution with increasing cluster size and shape. In Fig. 4 the energetically most important selective normal modes are plotted; the mode number a is in accordance with the increasing mode principal hardness (starting from the softest mode), ha, which is also given together with the wa probability weight. In the wa hierarchy this is the second highest wa mode, next after the totally nonselective normal mode (see, for example, Fig. 5), of practically no interest for chemical reactivity. In Fig. 5 we display the six most important (in the wa sense) modes for the six-pyramid structure with the relevant normal-mode characteristics.

Similarly, for dN < 0, when the cluster behaves as a global base, the fi < 0 atoms exhibit local acidic character and fs > 0 atoms behave as local basic centres. 173 The general conclusion following from Fig. 3 is that owing to unsaturated valencies of the cluster perimeter oxygens they exhibit relatively large, positive FF indices. This indicates a relatively high softness of these atoms, which therefore contribute most to the overall net change in the cluster number of electrons. As shown in Fig. 6 this artefact of the finite size of the cluster disappears when the terminal oxygens are hardened by the presence of hydrogens. It should be observed, however, that some of the FF distribution patterns inside the cluster remain unchanged by the saturation of terminal oxygen valencies. In particular, we would like to point out that in both cases the 0(3) oxygens exhibit negative fi values, and that the introduction of additional OH bonds creates also negative FF indices on some peripheral O(Z) atoms. The hydrogens in Fig. 6(b) now exhibit relatively high FF values, as expected for terminal atoms. The negative FF feature of the O atoms can be found already in the four-pyramid structure, the first to include such atoms, and it stays when the cluster size is increased. As we shall argue later in the text this property should be vital for catalytic activity. Therefore, we conclude that at least four-pyramid clusters should be used in model theoretical studies of vanadia chemisorption systems. It follows from Fig. 4 that the selective CT (SCT) mode, the most important energetically (second highest wa index), undergoes quite dramatic variations when the cluster size and shape are changed. In the one-pyramid cluster it represents mostly V -)- O polarization, while in the two- and threepyramid structures one detects mostly inter-oxygen polarization. In the fourpyramid cluster one observes a polarization between the central and peripheral pyramids, with charge displacement also being observed on the vanadium atom of the central pyramid. Yet another pattern, again redistributing charge mainly between O(Z) and 0(3) atoms in the centre, acting in one phase, and the peripheral atoms, acting in the opposite phase, is seen for the six-pyramid cluster. Finally, for the largest (fifteen-pyramid) structure, including some extra bridging oxygens, the polarization takes place between the whole central and peripheral sheets of pyramids, with the largest negative values being observed on the 0(3) atoms. As indicated in Fig. 4 the SCT mode hardness increases when large collections of neighbouring atoms act in phase. This is particularly true for the fifteen-pyramid SCT mode contour. The six energetically most important normal modes in the six-pyramid cluster are shown in Fig. 5. As already mentioned, the first mode contributing most to the CT energy is totally nonselective and represents almost uniform increase or decrease in AIM electron populations. The SCT mode, the second in the wa hierarchy, has already been discussed and identified as determining the catalytic site-selectivity. Examining the remaining modes of the figure shows that the wa weight decreases rapidly in accordance with the increasing polarization character of the mode. For this reason all of the remaining 20 modes (not shown in the figure) can be considered to be purely polarizational, wa - 0. It should also be noticed that in three selective modes with appreciable 174 wa indices, shown in Fig. 5, the 0(2) and 0(3) atoms exhibit negative contributions. Chemisorption systems and implicatians for catalytic mechanism As indicated in the previous CSA of metallic catalytic clusters [61 the FF and the normal-mode data for chemisorption systems provide a basis for qualitative predictions concerning the CT-induced desorption phenomena. The inflow/outflow of electrons to/from such systems can be thought of as resulting from: adsorption of additional molecules on the surface, the influence of the catalyst support, or the charge couplings with other surface units realized directly or indirectly (through the support).

Because of the importance of selective CT modes for the desorption selectivities [6] we also display (F3g.8) the highest wa selective CT modes for the same clusters. a=20 wa=0.035 ho = 0.329 (a) a=19 wa=0.016 ha= 0.302 a=25 wa= 0.044 he=0.644 a=22 wa=0.039 I I h~= 0.35 I (b) Fig. 8. a=25 wa= 0.008 he=0.69 a=22 wa=0.007 I I ha=0.403 I I I I I I 1 a=15 wa=0.011 I -- I - I he=0.246 I I I I I I a=20 wa = 0.005 1- - I - hQ=0.328 I I.

The four energetically most important (in the wa sense) selective normal modes in the 2H-chemisorbed systems of Mg. 2: (a) Va; (b) Vb; (c) Vc. In isolated small molecules the fi index reflects regional acidic/basic properties, which usually allow correct predictions of the reaction selectivity trends toward electrophilic or nucleophilic attacks [la, lb, 2e, 5, 6, 81. In heterogeneous catalysis the energetics of a reaction is determined by a redistribution of electrons in the whole cluster, and the local efficiency of the active site to accommodate the extra charge (by redistributing it to its crystal environment) may prove a decisive factor. This has been pointed out by some of the authors in their previous sensitivity analysis of metallic clusters [6]. Og to the unsaturated valencies on the cluster boundary, the terminal atoms exhibit artificially large positive FF indices, and this clearly does not necessarily imply that they are the preferred adsorption sites. This preference is determined by the global CT stabilization energy including contributions from alt constituent atoms. This is why the energetically most important normal modes were found to provide the most reliable reactivity criteria [6]. It should be realized that the fi redistribution pattern abstracts from any particular way through which the electrons were donated or withdrawn to/ from the system, since it characterizes the global equilibrium state of the cluster. Thus site selectivities will depend on the relative ability of a site to enhance or inhibit the formation of the chemisorption bond between the catalyst (C) and the adsorbate (M). When electrons are donated to the cluster M - C, the fi < 0 sites will enhance the coordination and the opposite is true for fs > 0 sites. The same conclusion applies for the M - C processes, since 177 for the global dN < 0 change, the f; < 0 sites exhibit a net increase in the number of electrons, thus enhancing the back-donation from cluster to adsorbate. Among the f; > 0 sites the same reasoning leads to the minimum f; reactivity criterion for a nucleophilic M (dN> 0) and the maximum fi criterion for an electrophilic M (dN< 0). In the H adsorption there is a net donation of electrons to the vanadia catalyst [11, 12], dN>0, so the catalyst acts as a global acid (A-type). The negative fs sites in A, local basic regions in A (Ab-type), represent the natural `electron sinks' of the A-cluster through which the incoming electrons can be effectively redistributed to the Aa-sites of the cluster (f'a > 0, local acidic regions in A). Also, during the H adsorption the Ab-sites further decrease their electron population, thus enhancing the C - M bond. We therefore conclude that the bridging oxygens, and especially 0(3) atoms (Fig. 3), are the preferred adsorption sites. Similarly, in the dN < 0 adsorption processes, when electrons are donated to the adsorbate, the cluster acts as a global base (B-type); now its fi < 0 sites behave as local acidic regions (Ba-type) and the fi > 0 regions act as a whole cluster (Bb-type). One could again consider the fi < 0 (Ba) locations to be the preferred adsorption sites, since they represent natural 'electron taps' of the B-cluster. The effect of excess electrons, resulting from adsorption of additional hydrogens or the presence of the catalyst support, on the H - C bond is represented by the FF distributions shown in Fig. 7. This effect is similar for the 2H adsorption on the O(z) and 0(3) atoms (Figs. 7(b) and 7(c)), and it differs significantly from that corresponding to the 2H adsorption on. the vanadyl (O(l)) oxygens (Fig. 7(a)). In the latter case the hydrogens substantially increase their electron population when extra electrons are added to the cluster, while the population of the terminal (vanadyl) oxygens (adsorption sites) remains practically unchanged. The opposite trend in the hydrogen electron population is observed in Figs. 7(b) and 7(c), where the electron populations of both bridging oxygens and hydrogens are practically unaffected by the excess electrons. This seems to suggest that the strengths of the 0(2)-H and 0(3)-H surface bonds will be only slightly modified by the successive adsorptions or a donation of electrons from the support. In the case of O(l)-H adsorption such an intervention of the cluster environment has a much stronger effect. Reference to Fig. 7(a) indicates that an inflow of extra electrons to the cluster should facilitate CT-induced desorption of hydrogens adsorbed on terminal oxygens. As shown in Figs. 7(b) and 7(c) such a CT has little effect on relatively strongly bonded protons on bridging oxygens. It should be observed that in the latter cases the whole OH group exhibits slightly negative FF indices of constituent atoms. A deeper understanding of the electron redistribution processes comes from examining the respective CT-active (wa > 0) population normal modes shown in Fig. 8, where we have omitted the nonselective mode with the highest wa parameter. For the interpretation of the CT-induced desorption processes, the modes with substantial electron population changes within 178 the OH groups are the most important. In Fig. 8(a), corresponding to the terminal oxygen 2H adsorption, such changes are observed in only two modes (a= 25, 22), which practically have a purely polarizational (wa-0) character. The shape of the a=19 mode, with a slight increase in the H electron population, supports our earlier conclusion that excess electrons can induce hydrogen desorption from the vanadyl oxygens. Notice that the a= 20 mode of Fig. 8(a) is practically the same as the a=20 mode of the bare cluster of Fig. 5; this indicates that the 0(3) bridging oxygens are still available as strongly preferred sites for successive adsorptions. The normal modes represent the independent (decoupled) unit vectors of the collective AIM population displacements (the normal population reference frame). In the present study the orientations of these principal axes are fixed for the CT-active (wa > 0) modes by the phase convention Fa > 0. The real equilibrium displacements of the AIM populations in a given normal mode, per unit change in the global number of electrons in a system, are measured by the product quantities wa -FQ UO > 0, defined in eqn. (5). The FQ weighting factors for the most important selective normal modes of Figs. 5 and 8 are listed in Table 1. It follows from the table that a relatively high Fa index for the SCT mode 20 in the bare cluster V further strengthens our earlier conclusion about the special roles played by the 0(3) atoms, namely that of the electron sinks in the dN > 0 chemisorption and that of the electron taps in the dN < 0 processes, on vanadia monolayer clusters. Moreover, the mode contours of Fig. 5 and the respective FF normal indices of Table 1 could suggest a similar role, be it with a lower site selectivity, for the 0(2) (modes 20 and TABLE 1 The FF indices (Fa) of the four energetically most important selective normal modes (Figs. 5 and 8) in the bare and 2H-chemisorbed six-pyramid vanadia clusters (Figs. 1 and 2) Cluster Mode (a) F V 20 0.119 23 0.060 19 0.064 12 0.063 Va 20 0.114 19 0.079 25 0.037 22 0.047 Vb 25 0.092 22 0.118 15 0.074 20 0.042 ve 22 0.122 25 0.096 9 0.068 21 0.050 179 23) and the vanadyl oxygens (modes 20, 23 and 19). However, the overall pattern of equilibrium population displacement (Fig. 6) clearly distinguishes the 0(3) atoms as the only sites exhibiting such a resultant property. Turning now to the chemisorption systems we would like to report the sums of the wj contributions over the four modes shown in Fig. 8 for each system, 0 = 1a4)w,,,i, for the adsorbed hydrogens and the respective oxygen chemisorption sites: Va: 0[O(l)] = +0.007; 0[H] = +0.014; Vb: 0[0(2)] = -0.047; 0[H] = -0.040; Vc: 0[0(3)]=-0.051; 0[H]=-0.045. These population changes within the O-H fragments indicate that the O(l) chemisorbed system has a tendency to increase the hydrogen population when electrons are added to the cluster, while the 0(2) and 0(3) systems withdraw electrons from the O-H fragments in such processes. This is in qualitative accord with the overall FF trends seen in Fig. 7 and the conclusions drawn from it. Thus the transfer of excess electrons to hydrogens in the Va cluster should indeed facilitate the H desorption, while the predicted removal of electrons from the 0(2)-H and 0(3)-H fragments in structures Vb and Vc, respectively, does indeed suggest that such fragments, already weakly bonded internally, could then also be removed more easily from the remainder of the cluster. Besides the CT-activation (active when dN 0 0) of the desorption processes there are also the polarizational (P) channels (active when dN= 0), which can participate in an internal population displacement of the chemisorption system. This distinction between the CT- and P-induction mechanisms is not an exclusive one, since the selective CT-active modes also include a strong polarizational component, which dominates in practically all the modes shown in Fig. 8. In such modes a small electron inflow to the system triggers a quite substantial internal redistribution of charge, which is ultimately responsible for differences in local chemisorption preferences. It should be realized, however, that there is a densely spaced band of purely polarizational (CT-inactive), soft population normal modes, through which the adsorbed species could be activated via an exclusively internal redistribution of electrons within the chemisorption cluster. We now examine the selective CT modes in the chemisorption clusters corresponding to the hydrogen being adsorbed on bridging oxygens (Figs. 8(b) and 8(c)). In contrast to the adsorption on the vanadyl oxygen, substantial population changes within the OH groups can already be seen in two modes (a=22, 25) exhibiting relatively high wa energy weights, which indicate that such modes - in addition to a strong polarization component - appreciably participate in the charge transfer and the associated stabilization energy. When additional electrons are transferred to the cluster via these modes, the constituent atoms of the OH groups increase their net charges (lessscreened nuclei), thus weakening 0(2)-H and 0(3)-H bonds, which could lead to the proton desorption. However, such changes in the electronic structure also weaken the 0(2, 3) =* V coordinations, since a decrease in the 180 oxygen electron population indicates a lower number of bonding electrons. This in turn could lead to a separation of such an OH group, weakly bonded to its cluster environment and with a weakened OH bond, from the cluster. The OH groups practically do not participate in the remaining modes shown in Figs. 8(b) and 8(c).
