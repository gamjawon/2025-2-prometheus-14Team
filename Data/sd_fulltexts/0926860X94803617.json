Except for the case of thepara-nitro derivative, the reaction is highly selective towards S-S bond hydrogenolysis since thiols were the only products formed. Molecular mechanics calculations evidenced that all the X-DPDS adopted the same conformation. These results may account for a high accessibility of the S-S bond to a plane surface explaining the high selectivity observed. Among the substituted DPDS, the dinitro compound was found to be poorly reactive and under more severe experimental conditions, hydrogen attacks preferentially the N-0 bond. Theoretical considerations may explain this behaviour. The presence of the other substituents i.e. Cl, NH2, CH3, OH, in a para position induces a diminution of the reaction rate whatever their nature. This behaviour is different from the one observed in homogeneous media using nucleophilic reagents to perform the same reaction. To interpret this discrepancy between the results of the heterogeneous reaction and those obtained in homogenous media, it is assumed that in the first case the reaction does not imply an important electron transfer from the catalytic site to the adsorbed molecules.

Introduction Industrially, thiochemistry is related to the synthesis of about 30 compounds, among which mercaptans, sulfides, polysulfides, sulfones or sulfoxides, thioacids *Corresponding author. 0926-860X/94/$07.00 1994 Elsevier Science B.V.

Calais et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 115 (1994) 303-314 and thioester which are used in increasing quantities in agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals products, petrochemicals, lubricants, cosmetics and gas odorants. Among them, mercaptans are the most important ones because they are very often used as starting materials for the synthesis of the other thiocompounds. Aliphatic mercaptans are currently prepared by direct thiolation of alcohols or through alkene reactions with HZS, using alkali metal salts or oxides supported on alumina and acidic catalysts [ 1 ] . Selectivities higher than 95% are generally obtained even for an almost complete conversion of the starting alcohol or alkene. By contrast, the synthesis of aromatic mercaptans seems to be less optimised. For instance, lower selectivities and conversions have been reported for the catalytic thiolation of phenol into benzenethiol [ 2,3 ] . The low selectivity observed in this reaction is probably due to the high temperatures and pressures required for the transformation of the reactant. The methods now in force for the synthesis of such thiols turn to reduction reactions which can be carried out under mild conditions, i.e. reduction of the corresponding sulfonic acids [ 4-7 ] or sulfonyl chlorides [ 810] with phosphorus or native hydrogen being produced with a metal and a mineral acid. Although high selectivities could be observed (90%), such procedures suffer from the disadvantage of forming large amounts of phosphoric acid or metal chloride wastes. Up to now most of the literature data related to the selective rupture of the S-S bond have evidenced that high yields can be obtained using nucleophilic reagents like hydrides, cyanides or phosphines [ 11-17 ] . Although high selectivities can be obtained under mild conditions, these reactions are not catalytic since an additional hydrolysis step is required to recover the thiol from the thiolate. Consequently, there is a need to develop catalytic processes working under mild conditions and allowing the selective synthesis of a wide number of arylthiols. For reactions involving sulfur containing molecules, the utilisation of sulfide catalysts can be envisaged since these solids are resistant to sulfur poisoning. Moreover, recent papers have evidenced that these solids can be applied to fine chemical synthesis because they could exhibit higher selectivities than other catalytic systems like metals and oxides [ 18,19]. Recently, we have investigated the ability of a series of alumina supported sulfide catalysts (Ru, Rh, Mo, W, NiMo, CoMo, etc.) to achieve the selective reduction of the non-substituted diphenyldisulfide (H-DPDS) into benzenethiol [ 20 ] . It was shown that sulfide catalysts are valid candidates to perform this catalytic reduction. In this study, results have evidenced that under the mild conditions used (T=433 K, PHZ =3 - 105 Pa), the selectivity towards benzenethiol was 100% independently of the chemical nature of the sulfided phase. Among these catalysts the mixed NiMo system was found to be the most active. The aim of the present work was to further examine the ability of sulfide catalysts to achieve selectively the S-S bond cleavage of para-substituted DPDS and to get information about the geometric or electronic factors which could affect the reducibility of the S-S bond. As mentioned in the introduction the NiMo system was C. Calais et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 115 (1994) 303-314 305 found to be the most efficient for the reduction of H-DPDS so that it was selected for this study. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst The NiMo/y-A1203 catalyst used was an industrial Procatalyse HR 346 (BET surface area 256 m2 g -') , containing 3 and 14 wt.-% of NiO and M003, respectively. Prior to the catalytic tests, the catalyst was crunched and sieved to a particle size of 100 Am (80-120 lum) and sulfided in a flow reactor at 673 K for 4 h under a stream of 15 % H2S - 85 % H2 (4 1 h -') . This procedure allowed the complete sulfidation of the oxidic transition metal phases. After cooling to room temperature, the sample was flushed with a nitrogen flow and stored under argon in sealed bottles to prevent its oxidation. 2.2. Reagents Diphenyldisulfide (H-DPDS) and para-substituted diphenyldisulfides X-DPDS (X = H, CH3, Cl. OH, NH2) as well as the solvent (diglyme) and the internal standard (n-tridecane) were purchased from Aldrich (purity > 99%) and used without any further purification. Hydrogen used for catalytic runs was a high purity gas (99.995 %) from Air Liquide. 2.3. Reaction test procedure The reactor used for the catalytic tests is a 200 cm3 stirred slurry tank reactor (STR) operating in batch mode. The scheme of the apparatus has been detailed elsewhere [ 20 ] . In atypical run, 80 cm' of a 0.3 M solution of the organic substrate in diglyme was charged into the autoclave with 0.2 g of n-tridecane used as internal standard for the gas chromatography (GC) analysis. 0.1 g of the freshly sulfided catalyst was then added to the solution. The reactor was flushed with nitrogen and heated to the reaction temperature (433 K). Nitrogen was then replaced by a hydrogen atmosphere (3 - 105 Pa) and the stirring was started. This step defined the zero time of the reaction. Samples (0.4-0.5 cm3) were periodically withdrawn during the reaction course. Taking into account that in these experimental conditions less than ten samplings were necessary to determine the evolution of the conversion versus time, the volume of solution withdrawn was negligible. The analyses of the solutions were performed on a HP 5890A gas chromatograph equipped with a FID detector and a non polar semi-capillary column (HP-1 methyl silicon gum, 5 m X 0.53 mm, film thickness 0.23 /u,m) at a temperature programmed from 313 K to 523 K (15 K /min). For most of the reagents studied, the only product formed 306 C. Calais et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 115 (1994) 303-314 was the corresponding benzenethiol. The conversions were calculated either from the disappearance of the reactant or the formation of the product. A preliminary study [20] has shown that using a stirring rate of 1500 revolutions per minute (rpm) and the experimental conditions described above (weight and particle size of catalyst, temperature and hydrogen partial pressure) the reaction proceeded under chemical control meaning that the overall mass transfer rate was faster than the reaction rate. In addition, blank tests were conducted in order to make sure that no reaction took place in the absence of any catalyst as well as that the solvent and the internal standard did not react in the presence of the catalyst. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Catalytic tests Except for the para-nitro DPDS, the transformation of the others X-DPDS (X = H, CH3, Cl, OH, NH2) leads selectively to the corresponding thiols X-C6H5SH. As a matter of fact, although sulfide catalysts are efficient and commonly used to achieve carbon-heteroatom hydrogenolysis or aromatic ring hydrogenations none of these reactions occurred under our experimental conditions because of the low temperature and pressure selected. For the para-N02 derivative no reaction was observed but under more severe conditions (T=473 K, pH2 -106 Pa) the reaction proceeds first via the hydrogenation of the -N02 substituents. This result will be discussed later in this paper. As the selectivity is 100% towards thiol formation, the reactivity of the various DPDS can be differentiated only by the level of activity of the catalyst for each reaction. Examples of the variations of the conversion as a function of time for HDPDS and para-chloro and para-methyl substituted DPDS are given in Fig. 1.

The calculated initial activities are reported in Table 1. The data show that the reaction rate of all the substituted DPDS are lower than the one observed for H-DPDS which exhibits the highest reactivity. In particular it should be mentioned that compared to H-DPDS, the lower reactivities of the XDPDS are independent of the electronic effect induced by the substituent X, electrowithdrawing for X = N02 and Cl or electro-donating for X = CH3, OH, NH2 (see Table 1) . Moreover, these different values are almost identical for all the X-DPDS (except for N02-DPDS which does not react). This finding is completely different from the results obtained [ 11-17) in homogeneous media when using nucleophilic reagents such as hydrides to perform the reductive cleavage of the X-DPDS. As a matter of fact, in these studies the authors have always observed that the reactivities of the different X-DPDS correlated with the electronic effects induced by the substituents, following a Hammett type relationship, i.e. the more withdrawing the substituent was, the higher was the rate. The observed order of reactivity was then NOZ > CI > H > CH3 > OH > N112It can be inferred that in our case the completely different results observed may arise from the presence of the catalyst. In particular in heterogeneous catalysis the nature of the adsorbed species is of prime importance and can be very different from the species which take part in reactions in homogeneous media. In our previous study [ 20] dealing with the catalytic properties of different sulfide catalysts for the reduction of H-DPDS, temperature-programmed reduction and temperature-programmed desorption studies have suggested that the presence of both SH groups and coordinatively unsaturated metal ions were a necessary requirement for the catalytic activity. Accordingly, a mechanism has been proposed in which the reaction may proceed via the addition of a Hs+ species (fixed on a sulfur anion) and of a Hs- adsorbed on a coordinatively sulfur-deficient metal ion. In this case the reaction step does not occur via an important charge transfer such as the one observed in classical organic cleavage by nucleophiles which could explain in part that the order of reactivity of the X-DPDS is not related to any electronic effect existing in the organic substrate. Compared to the reaction in homogeneous media, 308 C. Calais et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 115 (1994) 303-314 this lack of correlation in the case of the catalytic reduction of the S-S bond may also arise from different elementary reaction steps, steric effects or different adsorption modes depending on the nature of the reactant. To get more insight into these various possibilities, some molecular mechanics and quantum chemistry calculations have been done. The former calculations have been performed in order to see if the conformation of the organic molecule could be greatly affected by the presence of the substituent while molecular orbital calculations were undertaken in order to explain the lack of reactivity of the para-vitro compound. 3.2. Conformational analysis Molecular mechanics calculations, also known as force field calculations, have been used to investigate the molecular conformations [ 21 ] of the various aryldisulfides utilised in this study. The most stable conformations have been calculated by using the systematic SEARCH function within the molecular modelling program SYBYL (Tripos Associates, Saint Louis, MO). Since the geometry of the aromatic ring is flat, the three CSSC bonds were selected as the rotatable bonds. The torsion angles were defined by clockwise rotation around the appropriate bonds using rotation intervals of 10 A local energy minimum was observed for a dihedral CSSC angle of 90 This result agrees fairly well with previous quantum theoretical CNDO calculations performed on the model H2S2 [ 22 ] molecule or on symmetrical or asymmetrical aliphatic disulfides [ 23 ] . Fig. 2 shows the calculated most stable conformations of DPDS and of the dinitro derivative. These preferred geometries are also adopted by the other molecules independently of the chemical nature of the substituent (CH3. OH, Cl, NH2). Taking into account these data it appears that the S-S bonds are never hindered by steric effects coming from the rest of the molecule. If we assume that the molecular X= H C ~`S ~H X=N02 C S H Fig. 2. Most stable conformation of diphenyldisulfide (X=H), and para-dinitrodiphenylaisulfiae (X=NOZ). C.

Molecular orbital calculations The adsorption of a molecule on the surface of a catalyst can be typically described according to the Blyholder model [24,25 ] . In such a model, the chemisorptive bond relies on a combination of electron donation from an occupied adsorbate orbital to the surface, i.e. xz, yz or z2 orbitals of the transition metal ion, and back donation from the surface into an empty adsorbate level. Theoretical studies on sulfide catalysts were recently reviewed by Harris and Chianelli [ 26] . 310 C.

Therefore, the full description of the reacting molecule with the catalyst surface cannot be achieved. However, the initial adsorption step could be schematically described by comparing the adsorbate MO's with the electronic structure of the metal d block of the transition metal sulfide. To get information on molecular orbitals, Extended Huckel calculations have been done taking into account the conformational data obtained with the molecular mechanics modelling and using the ICON8 Foam program with the parameters listed in Table 2. Molecular orbital calculations have been performed by setting the origin of the molecule between the two sulfur atoms as shown in Fig. 3. The electronic structure of free DPDS can be depicted as follows: - The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) contains mainly the electronic contribution of the two sulfur lone pairs of the two sulfur atoms. The corresponding anti-bonding MO is located at much higher energy level ( - 0.8 eV) due to the presence of several .7r * MO having an energy comprised between - 4.5 and - 8.5 eV. - The energy of the it MO lies slightly below the HOMO (energy difference ca. 1 eV) On the right side of Fig. 3, we have also reported the schematic energy level diagram of the Mo d block of MOS2 proposed by Zonnevylle et al. [ 27 ] . As underlined by these authors, the Mo d orbitals are directly involved in the chemisorption process. According to them, the Fermi level of the MOS2 catalyst is thus close to the energy of the HOMO, 7T and ir* MO of H-DPDS. Although the catalyst used in this study was a nickel promoted molybdenum sulfide, we have utilised the diagram of the unpromoted solid since our objective is to give a qualitative description of the electronic process. It can also be expected that the presence of the promoter would result only in a slight rise of the Fermi level. From these representations, it can be envisaged that two types of interaction between the organic molecule and the free Mo d levels are energetically favoured: C. Calais et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 115 (1994) 303-314 311 ENERGY (eV) i I i IV -10.5 eV nO groups T Fig. 4. Schematic representation of the LUMO of para-dinitOiphenyldisulfide. (i) The electronic interaction of the it MO (or the ir* MO) of the aromatic ring in a geometrical flat position and the vacant bands (or the occupied bands) of the metal. (ii) The interaction of the HOMO with the metal vacant bands above the Fermi level. In this case, the adsorption may be visualised as an acid-base interaction in which the two sulfur lone pairs of H-DPDS (Lewis bases) share the electrons with the Lewis acid site located on coordinatively unsaturated metal cations present at the surface of the sulfide catalyst. On one hand, the first adsorption mode does not give any reaction since the experimental conditions used in this work are too mild to hydrogenate an aromatic ring. On the other hand, the second adsorption mode described above (i.e. adsorption by the S-S bond) is probably responsible for the activated adsorbed species which take part in the reaction leading to the selective cleavage of the H-DPDS. The calculations performed for the other X-DPDS show that except for the N02 group, the presence of apara-substituent does not to a great extend affect the energy levels of the MO represented in Fig. 3. They slightly modify the a (or -7r *) MO levels by adding a small contribution from the lone pairs in the p7 or py orbitals of the heteroatoms i.e. Cl, N, O. In contrast, for the almost non-reactivep-N02 derivative, the general MO scheme appears to be modified by the presence of a new unoccupied MO at -10.5 eV which is close to the Fermi level of MOS2. This LUMO is schematically represented in Fig. 4 which shows the strong contribution of the nitrogen and oxygen lone pairs. Such a MO is likely to be the best electron acceptor for a back donation of electrons from the d orbitals of the metal. This indicates the possibility of an important interaction of the surface with the N02 group. The resulting strong adsorption can explain the lack of reactivity of this molecule. As a matter of fact, taking into account the conformation of the X-DPDS (see the above conformational analysis) such an adsorption by the N02 group in para position should move the S-S bond far away from the surface of the catalyst preventing its activation. In order to verify 312 C. Calais et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 115 (1994) 303-314 this theoretical approach, we have performed a catalytic test at higher temperature (473 K) and hydrogen pressure (106 Pa). At the beginning of the reaction, the para-dinitro DPDS is converted into the para-amino nitro DPDS. After one hour, a mixture of para-amino nitro DPDS and para-diamino DPDS is observed with small amounts of para-nitro and para-amino benzenethiols. For longer reaction time (about 3 h) the conversion of the reactant is almost complete and an equimolar repartition of the above mentioned products has been detected. At the end of the reaction the para-aminotiophenol is the only product obtained. This indicates that the reaction proceeds preferentially through the hydrogenation of the N-O bonds confirming for this molecule an adsorption by the NOZ substituent. 4. Conclusions This work has evidenced that a conventional NiMo hydrotreating catalyst can achieve the catalytic reduction of para-substituted diphenyldisulfides (X-OS-SOX)into their corresponding mercaptans at moderate temperature and low hydrogen pressure. As a matter of fact, for X = H, Cl, NH2, CH3 and OH no secondary products have been detected in the reaction mixture. Molecular mechanics calculations showed that the conformation of the molecules remain identical whatever the substituent is. According to the calculated geometries, the aromatic rings are perpendicular to the S-S bond. As the latter is free from steric hindrance the adsorption can easily occur and this accounts for the selectivity of the catalytic reduction. Molecular orbital calculations performed on free molecules also suggest that such an adsorption through the S-S bond is energetically favoured on an anionic vacancy of the catalyst. By contrast, we have observed that the para-nitro derivative reacts differently since the reaction proceeds via the hydrogenation of the substituent (formation of the para-amino nitro and para-diamino DPDS) prior to the S-S bond cleavage. Such reactivity indicates a preferred adsorption through the nitro group. MO calculations indicate that the flat adsorption of the NOZ substituted aromatic ring could be favourable. Taking the conformational analysis into account, such adsorption moves the S-S bond off the surface of the catalyst, impeding its activation. Therefore, the behaviour of this compound differs from the other substituted DPDS. Concerning the reactivity, the presence of a substituent (Cl, NH2, CH3, OH) in a para position induces a diminution of the reaction rate independently of their field or resonance electronic effects. This behaviour is completely different from the one observed in homogeneous media using nucleophilic reagents [ 11-17] to perform the same reaction or from the CSP2-X hydrogenolysis of a series of X substituted benzenes catalysed by a sulfided phase [18]. In both cases strong electron donation from either the surface site or the nucleophilic agent have been evidenced. In the present study, similar conclusions cannot be drawn. The results C. Calais et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 115 (1994) 303-314 313 rather suggest that the reaction does not require an important electron transfer from the catalytic site to the adsorbed X-DPDS or vice versa. This work also shows that catalytic reactions can be significantly different from reactions in homogeneous media. Care should be taken when catalytic reaction results are interpreted in terms of organic chemistry of homogeneous reactions. Acknowledgements The authors thank Elf-Aquitaine for financial support.

The reactivity of a series ofpara-substituted diphenyldisulfides (X-DPDS, X = OH, NH2, CH3, NO2, CH3) have been determined in a G/L/S reactor in the presence of a sulfided nickel molybdenum sulfide catalyst. Except for the case of thepara-nitro derivative, the reaction is highly selective towards S-S bond hydrogenolysis since thiols were the only products formed. Molecular mechanics calculations evidenced that all the X-DPDS adopted the same conformation. These results may account for a high accessibility of the S-S bond to a plane surface explaining the high selectivity observed. Among the substituted DPDS, the dinitro compound was found to be poorly reactive and under more severe experimental conditions, hydrogen attacks preferentially the N-O bond. Theoretical considerations may explain this behaviour. The presence of the other substituents i.e. Cl, NH2, CH3, OH, in apara position induces a diminution of the reaction rate whatever their nature. This behaviour is different from the one observed in homogeneous media using nucleophilic reagents to perform the same reaction. To interpret this discrepancy between the results of the heterogeneous reaction and those obtained in homogenous media, it is assumed that in the first case the reaction does not imply an important electron transfer from the catalytic site to the adsorbed molecules.
