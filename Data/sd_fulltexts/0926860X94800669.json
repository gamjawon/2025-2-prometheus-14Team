Papageorgiou, A.M. Efstathiou, X.E. Verykios* Institute of Chemical Engineering and High Temperature Chemical Processes, Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Patras, GR-26500, Patras, Greece (Received 3 November 1993, revised manuscript received 4 January 1994) Abstract The oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to C-hydrocarbons was studied on a series of lithiumdoped titania catalysts by cofeeding methane (Pc,-1-0.5 bar) and oxygen (Po, -0.07-0.16 bar) at 1 bar total pressure in the temperature range of 750-900. The degree of lithium doping was varied between 0 and 4 wt.-% on Li20 basis. Electrical conductivity measurements confirmed that doping (i.e. incorporation of the Li + cations into the crystal structure of Ti02) did indeed occur. At 900, a C-hydrocarbons selectivity of the order of 70%, at a methane conversion level of 12%, was obtained over the 1 wt.-% Li20-doped Ti02 catalyst. This catalytic performance stayed practically constant within a period of 72 h of continuous reaction. Transient kinetic studies of ethene and ethane reactions with the lattice (in the absence of gaseous oxygen) and adsorbed (in the presence of gaseous oxygen) oxygen species of undoped and Li +-doped Ti02 catalysts showed that adsorbed oxygen species are more reactive towards ethene than ethane, while lattice oxygen is more reactive towards ethane than ethene. These results explain well the CHQ/CH6 product ratio obtained under OCM reaction conditions. It was also found that C2-hydrocarbons selectivity correlates well with surface acidity and basicity characteristics of the Li +-doped Ti02 catalysts.

Introduction The influence of surface promoters and dopants on the catalytic performance of Ti02 and other rare-earth oxides for the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) has gained a significant interest among many investigators [ 1-13 ] .

Papageorgiou et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 111 (1994) 41-62 crystal structure of the parent oxide. As a result of this process, the electron structure (Fermi energy level) [14], oxidation /reduction potential, acidity /basicity characteristics [10,15,16] and oxygen ion mobility [7,17-19] can be altered in a predictable manner. These parameters are expected to influence catalytic rates of surface reactions, which in turn control activity and selectivity parameters. Lane et al. [ 12] have studied a Li /T102 catalyst with variable Li20 content, in the range 0 to 31.7%, under OCM reaction conditions. However, the conditions employed in the formulation of their catalysts were significantly different than those used in the present investigation, primarily as regards calcination temperature and Li20 content. In particular, in the present catalyst, doping of Ti02 with Li + cations did occur during high-temperature diffusion, as evidenced by electrical conductivity measurements. Although no such information is provided for the catalysts employed by Lane et al. [ 12], doping is not expected to have occurred at the relatively low calcination temperature employed. Furthermore, in most cases, the Li20 concentration is well above the solubility limit. Comparison of the results of the two studies is of interest since they show significant differences in the effects of promotion and doping on catalytic parameters. Recent efforts in this laboratory have concentrated on the oxidative coupling of methane to form CZ-hydrocarbons over Ti02 catalysts doped with various cations of valence lower (Li +, ZnZ+) [9,10,19,20] or higher than that of the parent cation (TaS+, Nbs+ W6+) [20]. In these reports kinetic studies as well as studies on catalyst performance at high levels of methane conversion have been presented. In particular, emphasis has been given in correlating the effects of lattice oxygen mobility, surface acidity /basicity characteristics as well as bulk and surface composition with catalytic properties. From those studies, lithium-doped Ti02 appeared to be a promising catalyst for the reaction under study. In the present study, results on the lithium-doped Ti02 catalyst are reported with an optimum lithium dopant concentration and calcination temperature, a high methane pressure (0.5 bar), a CH4/O2 feed ratio in the range of 3 to 7, and at temperatures between 750 and 900. Transient experiments with CZH4/He, CZH6/He, CZH4/O2 and CA/Oz mixtures have also been conducted in order to obtain information concerning the reactivity of lattice and adsorbed oxygen towards CZ-hydrocarbons, and to relate this with the CZHq/CZH6 product ratio obtained under OCM reaction conditions over the Li +-doped Ti02 catalysts. The stability of the Li +-doped Ti02 catalyst with reaction time is also presented. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation and characterization of Li +-doped Ti0Z catalysts Lithium-doped Ti02 catalysts were prepared by high-temperature diffusion. Lithium nitrate was used as precursor of the doping Li + cation in appropriate amounts so as to yield lithium concentrations in the range of 0 to 4 wt.-% (based on Li20/ (Li20+Ti02)). The precursor was mixed with Ti02 of the anatase form (Degussa P-25) in a beaker containing distilled water. The slurry was heated under continuous stirring to evaporate the water, and the residue was dried at 110 overnight. The solid material obtained was crushed and sieved to 48 mesh, placed in a ceramic tube and then fired in air at the temperature of 900, D. Papageorgiou et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 111 (1994) 41-62 43 unless otherwise indicated. The firing procedure involved placing the ceramic tube in a furnace and heating at a rate of 15/min to the calcination temperature, maintaining at this temperature for 6 h and then allowing to cool slowly to room temperature. The Li +-doped Ti02 catalysts were characterized in terms of total surface area (BET), their electrical conductivity and activation energy of electron conduction, surface acidity and basicity characteristics, bulk lattice oxygen diffusion and surface lattice oxygen exchange with '802 [ 19], bulk composition (X-ray diffraction) as well as surface composition (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, XPS). Details of the experimental procedures have been reported elsewhere [ 10,19] . 2.2. Flow system for catalyst performance and transient studies Catalyst testing was conducted in a conventional flow apparatus. This consisted of a flow measuring and control system, a mixing chamber, a fixed bed reactor and an on-line gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, 9A). The flow system consists of three compressed gas cylinders: pure methane, 10% OZ/He or pure oxygen, and helium, which are connected to thermal mass flow meters and control valves (MKS, 274C). The flow-rates of gas streams are thus monitored and controlled. In all experiments the methane pressure was maintained constant at 0.5 bar while the oxygen pressure was varied between 0.07 and 0.17 bar, unless otherwise indicated. Helium was used as diluent. The reactor was a quartz tube, 10 mm I.D., the exit of which was a quartz tube of 2 mm I.D. The catalyst particles, of an average diameter of 0.2 mm were placed near the exit tube. The reactor was encased in a furnace (Heraeus) which was controlled by a programmable temperature controller. The temperature of the catalyst bed was measured by a thermocouple placed in the middle of the bed, encased within a quartz thermowell. Separation of the effluent product stream from the reactor was performed on two packed columns, a Carbosieve (for separation of 02, CO, CH4 and COZ) and a Poropak Q (for separation of CO2, CZH4, CZH6, H20 and higher hydrocarbons). The feed was also analyzed using a loop of a sampling valve of the gas chromatograph. Certified calibration gas mixtures were used to calculate response factors of all components. Transient experiments for studying the reactivity of CZ-hydrocarbons with lattice and adsorbed oxygen species of the catalyst were performed in a flow system which has been described elsewhere [ 10,21 ] . Continuous monitoring of the transient responses obtained from the reactor was performed by an on-line mass spectrometer (VG-Quadrupoles, Sensorlab 200D) equipped with a fast response inlet capillary system. The reactor system used consisted of a 7.0-mm I.D. quartz tube of 2.0 ml nominal volume, narrowed to a 4.0-mm I.D. quartz tube before and after the catalyst bed. Heating was provided by a furnace controlled by a programmable temperature controller (Omega Engineering Inc., CN-2010) , whereas the temperature was measured by a K-type thermocouple encased in a quartz capillary tube. The latter was placed in the middle of the catalyst bed. All gases were used at a flow-rate of 30 cm'/ min (ambient). 3. Results 3.1. Influence of Li+-doping of Ti02 on physicochemical structure The influence of Li +-doping of Ti02, at concentration levels between 0 and 4 wt.-% on oxides basis, on the physicochemical parameters of the resulting material was discussed in O D. Papageorgiou et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 111 (1994) 41-62 a previous publication [ 10] . In summary, BET surface areas, as obtained by argon adsorption at liquid nitrogen temperature, were found to be in the neighborhood of 0.2 M2/ g, not significantly affected by Li+-doping, within the concentration range investigated. X-ray diffraction measurements revealed the presence of Li2Ti03 phase only on the 4 wt.-% Li20doped Ti02 catalyst. Such a phase was not detected at lower Li20 concentration levels. Lithium oxide and lithium carbonate phases were not detected in any of the 1-4 wt.-% Li20/TiO2 catalysts after doping. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of the 4 wt.-% Li20/TiO2 catalyst detected some segregation of Li + at the surface of the material, as compared to bulk phase concentration. Atomic ratios of Ti/O and Li/Ti of 0.35 and 0.42, respectively, were found, to be compared to 0.47 and 0.22, respectively, for the bulk composition. No indication of the presence of Li20 and/or Li2C03 on the catalyst surface before reaction was found by the XPS measurements. Alterations in the electronic structure of Ti02, which is a n-type semiconductor, upon doping with cations of lower valence (Li + ) were determined by measurements of electrical conductivity and activation energy of electron conduction. The former quantity was found to decrease with increasing Li +-dopant concentration in the Ti02 matrix, while the opposite was observed for the latter quantity. These results are in agreement with theoretical predictions and they demonstrate that doping of Ti02 does indeed occur, following the procedure which was described earlier. Surface acidity and acid strength distribution was determined by the amine titration technique [22] while total surface basicity was estimated by carbon dioxide adsorption/ desorption techniques [ 10] . It was found that surface acidity decreased monotonically with increasing Li +-dopant concentration in the catalyst while surface basicity was found to be enhanced upon doping (1 wt.-% Li20/TiO2) and to decrease at higher levels of doping. 3.2. Catalyst performance studies 3.2.1. Effects of Li +-dopant concentration The effects of Li +-dopant concentration in the Ti02 matrix on methane activity, CZhydrocarbons selectivity and yield were investigated in the temperature range of 750 to 900, with a constant methane pressure of 0.5 bar and CH,/02 ratios of 3 and 7. Specific initial reaction rates of methane consumption, determined at methane conversions of less than 5%, are shown in Fig. 1 as a function of the Li20 content of the catalyst. These results pertain to a reaction temperature of 900, CH4102 ratios of 3 and 7 and a constant W/F ratio. It is apparent that the activity of the catalyst is enhanced upon doping and that a maximum in catalytic activity is exhibited at a Li20 concentration level of 1 wt.-%. These conclusions were also found to be valid under integral reactor operating conditions at methane conversions between 10 and 30%. CZ-hydrocarbons selectivity in this reaction system is a definite function of methane conversion. To illustrate the influence of Li20 concentration in the catalyst on C2 selectivity, this parameter is shown as a function of methane conversion for CH4/OZ ratios of 3 (Fig. 2a) and 7 (Fig. 2b). At both CH4102 ratios, C2-hydrocarbons selectivity, at the same methane conversion level, is significantly enhanced upon doping and continues to increase with dopant concentration up to 2 wt.-%, at which level selectivity exhibits a maximum D.

Comparison of Fig. 2a and 2b, within the common range of methane conversion, shows that selectivity is somewhat higher at the higher CH4/Oz ratio, as would be expected. However, although the oxygen partial pressure is more than doubled in going from the high to the low CH4/OZ ratio, the reduction in selectivity is only a few percentage points. The influence of Li20-dopant concentration in the Ti02matrix on yield of C2-hydrocarbons is illustrated in Fig. 3 for CH4/OZ ratios of 3 and 7. These results pertain to oxygen conversions higher than 90%, at which level maximum yields were observed. At both oxygen partial pressures, maximum yield is obtained at a U20 concentration in the neighborhood of 2 wt.-%. Higher yields are obtained at the higher oxygen partial pressure (CH4/ OZ = 3) due to significantly higher methane conversions which are achieved. The influence of reaction temperature on CZ-hydrocarbons selectivity is shown in Fig. 4. It is apparent that, at constant methane conversion level, selectivity is enhanced with increasing reaction temperature. This phenomenon is more pronounced at low conversion levels. At conversion levels approaching 30%, the influence of temperature on selectivity is a weak one. Product distribution in this complex reaction network is of significant importance from the practical point of view as well as from fundamental aspects since it reveals information concerning the overall reaction network. The CZH4/CZH6 ratio obtained over the 1 wt.-% Li20/TiO2 catalyst at reaction temperatures of 750 and 850 is shown in Fig. 5a as a function of methane conversion. Also shown is the oxygen conversion vs. methane conversion obtained at 850. The CZH4/C2H6 ratio increases significantly with increasing methane conversion (or, alternatively, with increasing reactor space-time) and with increasing temperature, especially at high conversion levels. It should be mentioned that the CZH4/ C2H6 ratios obtained over this catalyst are significantly higher than those reported in the literature, obtained over other catalysts. Worth noting is the large increase of C2H4/CZH6 ratio in the methane conversion range between 20 and 30%, as oxygen conversion approaches 100%. This behavior is discussed later. The CO/COZ ratio is also shown as a 46 D.

This ratio decreases with increasing conversion while it is significantly enhanced at the higher reaction temperature. The effects of reactants partial pressure and temperature on activity and product distribution were investigated employing the 1 wt.-% U20-doped Ti02 catalyst. It was found that methane and oxygen conversion increased with increasing the partial pressure of either of the reactants, at constant reactor space-time, which is consistent with the positive reaction rate order with respect to both reactants [ 10]. The influence of methane pressure on CZhydrocarbons selectivity is that, for constant methane conversion, selectivity is higher at the lower reactants pressure, a result which was found to be valid over the entire feed composition range investigated (Po,cH, between 0.03 and 0.5 bar) and for all CH4/OZ ratios ( between 1 and 7 ) .

Stability of catalytic performance of the 1 wt.-% LizO/Ti02 catalyst The stability of the catalytic performance of the 1 wt.-% Li20/TiO2 catalyst, calcined at 1000, was tested for a period of 72 h on stream at 900, a methane partial pressure of 0.5 bar and CH4102 ratio of 7. Methane conversion and selectivity are shown in Fig. 6 as a function of time-on-stream, under the conditions stated. Fig. 6 shows that after approximately 8 h on stream the catalyst exhibits a stable performance. During the initial 8 h period, methane conversion drops by approximately 2 percentage points, while selectivity drops by approximately 7 percentage points during the initial 5 h period. However, activity and selectivity remain stable during the remaining period of the experiment. 48 D.

Correlation of activity and selectivity parameters with catalyst aciditylbasicity characteristics As stated in previous sections, the catalysts employed in the present investigation were characterized in terms of surface acidity and basicity. An attempt is made to correlate these catalyst characteristics with the observed activity and selectivity parameters. For this purpose, initial rates and initial selectivities, at methane conversions less than 5%, were obtained. Conversion was maintained at low levels so as to minimize consecutive reactions of primary products. The initial selectivity obtained at 750, a CH4/OZ feed ratio of 3 and Po,cl-u -0.5 bar is shown in Fig. 7 as a function of surface acidity or surface basicity of the catalysts. It is D.

Selectivity increases rapidly with surface basicity, exhibiting a maximum at a surface basicity value of approximately 20 EUmol/m2. It should be noted that these correlations should be viewed with caution since the variation of surface properties of the catalysts was achieved by cation doping which affects catalytic performance by other means as well. 3.4.

Following the initial transient response, there is a decrease of carbon dioxide production with time-on-stream, the magnitude of which is different for the two catalysts. For example, there is a rapid (within 30 s) decrease of carbon dioxide production rate for the Li +-doped Ti02 catalyst, while a smaller decrease is obtained for the undoped Ti02. For the latter catalyst, a shoulder appears after 1 min of reaction. Methane is also formed during reaction but only over the undoped Ti02 catalyst. This methane response is different from that of carbon dioxide. Integration of the transients of Fig. 8 D. Papageorgiou et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 111 (1994) 41-62 51 provides the amounts of carbon dioxide and methane produced. For the undoped Ti02, 10.0 Am01 COZ/g and 5.4 Amol CH4/g are obtained, whereas 6.6 Am01 COZ/g are obtained for the Li +-doped Ti02 catalyst. During reaction of ethene with the lattice oxygen of undoped and Li+-doped Ti02 catalysts (Fig. 8), carbonaceous species accumulate on the surface. Fig. 9 shows the results of the isothermal oxygen titration experiments at 800 of these carbonaceous species to carbon dioxide, following reaction with 10% C2H4/He mixture at 800 for 10 min and a helium purge for 3 min. It is found that the carbonaceous species are very reactive towards oxygen, and the reaction is complete after 30 s or 60 s for the case of undoped and Li+doped Ti02, respectively. Note that a shoulder appears in the carbon dioxide response curve after about 40 s of reaction in the case of Li+-doped Ti02 (Fig. 9). The amount of carbonaceous species accumulated on the surface after reaction with CA/He is calculated based on the area under the transients of Fig. 9. This is found to be 8.5 and 54.8 Amol/g for undoped and Li +-doped Ti02, respectively. 3.4.2. Reactivity of ethane with the lattice oxygen (C2H6/He reaction) Fig. 10 shows transient responses of gas-phase carbon dioxide at 700 and 845 following the switch: He-> 10% C2H6/He (t) over undoped and Li+-doped Ti02 catalysts. At the lowest temperature studied (700), there is an initial sharp increase in the rate of production of carbon dioxide as the CA/He mixture starts to flow over the catalyst, followed by a quick decrease. The rate of reaction subsequently goes through a second overshoot, larger than the first one, the time of appearance of which depends on the catalyst formulation. Following this second peak, a third small peak also appears after about 7 min of reaction in the case of Li +-doped Ti02 catalyst, and a shoulder after about 90 s of reaction in the case of undoped Ti02 catalyst. Increasing the temperature to 845, in the case of undoped Ti02 (Fig. 10) the second peak observed at 700 disappears, the intensity of the first peak (spike) increases signif- 10 TiOE(845) 8 oe 6 TiOZ(700) 4 t 5 Li/TiOz(700) O 2 (zs) 0 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Time (min) He ~- 10 % CEHa/He Fig. 10.

A similar experiment performed over the Li +-doped Ti02 catalyst resulted in a qualitatively similar carbon dioxide response as that observed over the undoped Ti02 catalyst. Integration of the transients shown in Fig. 10 provides the amount of carbon dioxide produced during reaction of ethane with the lattice oxygen of the catalysts. This is found to be: 47.6 and 28.0 ftmol COZ/g at 700 and 845, respectively, in the case of undoped Ti02, whereas in the case of Li +-doped Ti02, 15.5 and 43.3 Amol COZ/g at 700 and 845, respectively, are measured. As in the case of C'.ZHQ/He reaction with the lattice oxygen of the catalysts, carbonaceous species also accumulate during reaction with CZH6/He (Fig. 10). The transient kinetics of the oxidation of these carbonaceous species to form carbon dioxide is presented in Fig. 11 at 700 and 845, for undoped and Li' -doped Ti02 catalysts. Following reaction with CZH6/He, the feed is changed to helium for 3 min followed by a switch to 10% 02/He while the carbon dioxide response is followed with on-line mass spectrometry. In the case of undoped Ti02 at 700, upon switching to the 02/He mixture a rapid increase in the rate of production of carbon dioxide is obtained which then increases slowly for a period of about 7 min. Then, the rate of increase of the carbon dioxide production rate becomes larger and a second peak is formed after about 10 min of oxygen titration. In the case of undoped Ti02 oxygen titration at 845 results in a different transient behavior. Upon switching to the 02/He mixture the rate of production of carbon dioxide is very small (Fig. 11) and remains so after about 7 min of reaction. Then, a large increase in the rate is obtained and a carbon dioxide peak is formed with a maximum at a shorter time than in the case of oxygen titration at 700. On the other hand, oxygen titration at 845 over Li +-doped Ti02 results in a transient different from that obtained at 845 with undoped Ti02. The initial rate of carbon dioxide formation (first peak) is larger and the time of appearance of the second peak is smaller than in the case of undoped Ti02- Integration of the transients of Fig. 11 8 Li/TiOR(845) N TiOE( 845) TiOZ(700) 0 2 4 8 8 10 12 14 16 Time (min) He ~--10 % 02/He Fig. 11.

These are found to be: 278 and 82 gmol/ g at 700 and 845, respectively, over the undoped Ti02 catalyst, and 160 and 500 Amol/ g, respectively, over the Li +-doped Ti02 catalyst. 3.4.3. Reactivity of ethene and ethane with adsorbed oxygen species (CZHqlOZ and CZH6/ 0, reactions) Transient experiments with 8% CZH4/6.6% OZ/He and 8% C2H6/6.6% 02/He mixtures in the range of 570 to 680 have been conducted in order to study the reactivity of adsorbed oxygen species towards ethene and ethane, the former produced by interaction of gaseous oxygen with the catalyst surface. It was determined that, under the present experimental conditions, gas-phase oxidation reactions of the C2-hydrocarbon molecules leading to carbon dioxide were absent. Upon switching from helium to the CZH4/OZ/He or C2H6/OZ/ He mixture, a rapid increase in the rate of production of carbon dioxide is obtained, while within about 2 min on stream a steady-state value in the rate of reaction is achieved. Tables 1 and 2 show the specific reaction rate, R, (umol/min m2) of carbon dioxide formation from the CZH4/OZ and CZHr,/02 reactions, respectively, over the undoped and 2 wt.-% Li20-doped Ti02 catalysts. For comparison purposes, the initial rates of reaction, Rz (f.tm01 / min m2) of ethene and ethane with the lattice oxygen of these catalysts are also given in Tables 1 and 2. These rates are calculated based on the transient results of Figs. 8 and 10. In the case of ethene, it clearly appears that adsorbed oxygen species are more reactive than lattice oxygen species towards combustion of ethene to form carbon dioxide (Table I ). On the other hand, in the case of ethane, lattice oxygen is much more reactive than adsorbed oxygen species to form carbon dioxide (Table 2). Worth noting is the decrease of the specific reaction rate with increasing reaction temperature in the case of CZH4/OZ reaction over the Li +-doped Ti02 catalyst (Table 1).

[ 211. 4. Discussion 4.1. Catalytic performance of LiM02 system There are only limited reports related to lithium-titania catalysts employed in the methane oxidative coupling reaction to form C2-hydrocarbons [ 12,23 ] . However, lithium has been used as a promoter or dopant of many catalysts for the present reaction system [ 11,24-29] . Lane et al. [ 12] have studied the Li/Ti02 catalyst with variable Li20 content, in the range of 0 to 31.7 wt.-%, over a wide range of experimental conditions. Preparation of their Li/ Ti02 catalysts involved calcination at a temperature of 600 while reaction was carried out at temperatures between 650 and 800. It is not certain, and no evidence has been provided, that under these conditions incorporation of Li' cations into the crystal matrix of Ti02 (doping) did take place. On the other hand, Li/Ti02 catalysts employed in the present study were calcined at temperatures between 900 and 1000 and evidence has been presented, in the form of measurements of electrical conductivity and activation energy of electron conduction [ 10], that Ti02 was indeed doped with Li' cations, following the procedure described in a previous section. This is a significant difference between the Li/ Ti02 catalysts employed by Lane et al. [ 12] and those employed in the present study. This difference is also illustrated in the performance characteristics of the two catalytic systems. In the former case the Li/Ti02 catalysts exhibited optimum performance at a Li20 level of approximately 17 wt.-%, they were active at low temperatures and their stability was low since the space-time yield of CZ-hydrocarbons dropped by a factor of 5 after 47 h of operation. In the latter case, the optimal L120 loading is in the range of 1 to 2 wt.-%, the catalysts are active at high reaction temperatures and their stability is significantly better. In addition, XPS measurements performed on the present 4 wt.-% Li20/TiO2 catalyst indicated that some segregation of lithium from the bulk to the surface had occurred, since a Li/Ti ratio of 0.42 was obtained, to be compared to 0.22 for the bulk composition [ 10]. However, the same catalyst (4 wt.-% Li20/TiO2) used by Lane et al. [ 12] showed a Li/ Ti ratio of 0.71. Thus, it can be stated that the Li/Ti02 catalysts prepared and tested by D. Papageorgiou et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 111 (1994) 41-62 55 Lane et al. [ 12 ] possess a significantly different physicochemical structure as compared to the Li/Ti02 catalysts prepared and tested in the present study. It could probably be stated that the former catalysts exhibited a Li +-promotional effect rather than a dopant effect, the latter being operative in the present catalysts. Doping of Ti02 with foreign cations implies incorporation of the latter into the crystal matrix of the parent metal oxide, at defect sites and/or substituting Ti\" cations. The fact that doping of Ti02 with Li + cations did indeed occur, following the methodology described earlier, has been demonstrated by measured alterations in the electrical conductivity and activation energy of electron conduction [ 10] . In general, doping of a semiconducting metal oxide with a cation of valence lower or higher than that of the parent cation results in alterations in the electronic structure of the material, as reflected in shifts of the Fermi energy level and the work function of the surface. Figs. 1-3 clearly demonstrate that doping Ti02 with Li + cations influences significantly its catalytic performance under OCM reaction conditions. The degree of alteration of activity and selectivity seems to be a function of the dopant concentration in Ti02. Thus, an optimal Li20-dopant concentration of ca. 1 wt.-% is shown in Fig. 1 to maximize catalytic activity. Selectivity towards C2 hydrocarbons is more drastically affected by Li' -doping and an optimal concentration of ca. 2 wt.-% Li20 is shown to exist (Figs. 2a and 2b) for selectivity maximization. A comparison of Figs. 2a and 2b also reveals that the order of selectivity with respect to dopant concentration might be influenced by the CH4/OZ ratio. The optimal concentration for yield maximization is ca. 2 wt.-% Li20, as shown in Fig. 3. These alterations in catalytic performance of Ti02 upon doping with Li + cations may be attributed to either or both of the following factors: (a) changes in bulk and surface electronic properties caused by the doping process, such as electrical conductivity, Fermi energy level, surface work function, and oxygen ion mobility [ 14,17,30,31 ]; (b) changes in surface chemical composition and surface properties (i.e. surface acidity /basicity characteristics) caused by segregation of the doping cation to the surface [ 10,15 ] . 4.1.1. Effect of Li' -dopant on methane activity It has been demonstrated recently [ 19] that a good correlation exists between catalytic activity (initial methane consumption rate) and lattice oxygen mobility, as characterized by the activation energy of lattice oxygen diffusion, of the present Li +-doped Ti02 catalysts. The catalyst with the highest activation energy of lattice oxygen diffusion (1 wt.-% Li20) appears to be the most active (see Fig. 1) . It seems that activation of the methane molecule to form CHI radicals requires a less mobile surface oxygen species, in accordance with what has been proposed earlier [32]. It can be further speculated that the catalyst surface may possess [Li+0-] centers which facilitate the stability of O- species and which may be responsible for methane activation. Such centers have first been observed by Ito et al. [24] over the Li/MgO catalyst. X-ray diffraction measurements performed on the 1 and 4 wt.-% Li20-doped Ti02 catalysts revealed that Li2Ti03 is present in the latter catalyst formulation, whereas no such indication was found for the former catalyst [ 10] . It may be appropriate to state that by increasing the L'Z0 dopant concentration, Li2Ti03 is formed at the expense of [Li+0- ] centers on the catalyst surface which results in decreased ability for methane activation. 56 D. Papageorgiou et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 111 (1994) 41-b2 4.1.2. Effect of Li +-dopant on CZ-hydrocarbons selectivity It is well established that doping of a semiconductor (such as Ti02) with cations of valence lower than that of the parent cation (Li + in the present case) reduces the n-type semiconductivity of the parent material or even transforms it into a p-type. It has also been shown [ 15 ] that C2 hydrocarbons selectivity under OCM conditions is favored over a ptype semiconducting catalyst. Thus, the significant enhancement of selectivity of Li +-doped Ti02 could be attributed to this factor. However, the fact that an optimal Li20-dopant concentration exists clearly demonstrates that this is not the only factor responsible for alterations in selectivity in the present catalytic system. Evidence for this is found in the reactivity results of ethene with the catalyst surface to form carbon dioxide in the presence of gaseous oxygen (Table 1). It is shown that the specific reaction rate of ethene with adsorbed oxygen species is largely enhanced when Ti02 is doped with Li + cations. On the other hand, there is a decrease in the combustion rate of ethane to form carbon dioxide when Ti02 is doped with Li' cations. The results of the reaction rate of ethane with the lattice oxygen of the catalysts are also important, pertaining to conditions of high oxygen conversions under OCM reaction. Table 2 shows that when Ti02 is doped with Li' cations, the reaction rate of ethane with lattice oxygen is drastically reduced, while there are only small effects on the combustion rate of ethene (Table 1). As mentioned earlier, doping of a semiconductive metal oxide with altervalent cations influences not only bulk properties but also surface properties, such as acidity and basicity as well as acidic/basic strength distribution. Results on the acidity and basicity characteristics of the present Li20/TiO2 catalysts were reported recently [ 10]. Acidity and acid strength distribution was determined employing the amine titration technique while basicity was determined by selective carbon dioxide chemisorption. The basicity measurements performed were directly related to the basic character of surface oxygen anion species. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of carbon dioxide revealed two well-resolved peaks [ 10] , likely attributed to two different oxygen species; that of lattice oxygen and O-, the latter associated with the [Li+0-] centers as previously discussed. A correlation between selectivity and total surface acidity /basicity is attempted in Fig. 7. It should be stated, however, that surface acidity /basicity was not varied independently but only through the doping process, as a result of which many other catalyst parameters varied, as discussed earlier. Thus, the results of Fig. 7 should be viewed with extreme caution and only very general conclusions should be attempted. It is probably safe to state that surface acidity is detrimental to selectivity, in accordance with results of other investigators [ 33 ] . The weak maximum observed in selectivity at low levels of acidity might also indicate that low surface acidity might improve selectivity, as also mentioned by Becker and Baerns [ 16] . A significant enhancement of selectivity with increasing surface basicity is observed. At high values of basicity, however, selectivity seems to be somewhat reduced. These results are qualitatively similar to those reported over La203-CaO catalysts [ 16] . 4.1.3. Effects of temperature on C,-hydrocarbons selectivity The fact that selectivity to CZ-hydrocarbons formation is, to a large extent, governed by surface processes is illustrated in Fig. 4 in which selectivity is shown to increase with increasing temperature, in the range of 750 to 900, at constant methane conversion. This result implies that the rate of CZ-hydrocarbons formation increases with temperature in a D. Papageorgiou et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 111 (1994) 41-62 57 larger extent than the rate of CO. formation. This is consistent with the relative values of the activation energies of the two reaction routes. It was found that the activation energy of Cz hydrocarbons formation is approximately 8 kcal/mol higher than that of CO., formation [ 10] . The beneficial influence of temperature on selectivity is maintained even at high temperatures although gas-phase combustion reactions at these temperatures are expected to play an increasingly significant role. If it is assumed that coupling of CH; radicals (formed on the catalyst surface) occurs in the gas phase, as reaction temperature increases the rate of coupling of CH; radicals to form ethane is expected to increase. However, it is also true that the rate of combustion of ethane and ethene to form CO. in the gas phase is also expected to increase with increasing temperature. The variation of selectivity with temperature may further imply that the surface coverage of carbon intermediate species which are in the pathway for CZ hydrocarbons and CO. formation must increase or decrease, respectively, with increasing reaction temperature. The transient results of Figs. 9 and 11 and others reported earlier [21,34] show that the conversion of ethene and ethane to carbon dioxide by lattice oxygen leads to surface carbonaceous species. The amount of these species which react with gas-phase oxygen to produce carbon dioxide decreases with increasing reaction temperature in oxygen flow. This observation is consistent with the results of Fig. 4. In addition, the studies with CZH4/ OZ and CZH6/OZ mixtures revealed that the rate of combustion of ethene to form carbon dioxide decreases to a greater extent with increasing temperature (Table 1) than the increase of the rate of ethane combustion (Table 2). 4.1.4. Effects of methane and oxygen pressures on CZ-hydrocarbons selectivity It was found that increasing the methane pressure from 0.3 to 0.5 bar and the oxygen pressure proportionately so as to keep the CH,/02 ratio constant at 3 or 7, results in an increase in methane conversion for a given WIF ratio. This result is consistent with the positive order of reaction rate with respect to both methane and oxygen [ 10] . However, selectivity decreases with increasing reactants pressure at a given methane conversion level. This result may be attributed to enhanced rates of combustion in the gas phase due to increased oxygen pressure. However, this is not necessarily the only factor since the same phenomenon was observed at low temperatures at which gas-phase reactions are not significant. To explain correctly the effects of oxygen pressure on CZ selectivity, the effects of oxygen pressure on the kind and coverage of adsorbed oxygen species which are in the reaction pathway to form CO,, from methane, and the interaction of ethane and ethene with such species must be understood. The reactivity results of ethene and ethane with the catalyst surface (Tables 1 and 2) indicate that the rate of ethene combustion in the presence of oxygen over the 2 wt.-% U20 M02 catalyst is much larger than the corresponding reaction rate of CZH6/OZ mixture. The opposite behavior is found for the rate of combustion of ethene and ethane with the lattice oxygen of the catalyst (CA/He and CZH6/He feed mixtures). It is suggested that the presence of gaseous oxygen leads to the formation of adsorbed oxygen species, like O-, which decrease, on an average basis, the effective charge of Ti' + and Li + cations on the surface, as compared to that found in the presence of lattice OZ- species and oxygen vacancies. The Ti\" and Li + cation species, as well as adsorbed/ lattice oxygen species may be viewed acting as pairs of centers for ethene and ethane chemisorption and hydrogen abstraction with subsequent reactions to form carbon dioxide. 58 D. Papageorgiou et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 111 (1994) 41-62 It seems that chemisorption of ethene on the aforementioned sites becomes stronger when the effective charge of these sites is reduced. This, in turn, increases the rate of C-C bond breaking, eventually leading to carbon dioxide. The oxygen pressure is, therefore, an important parameter in controlling the coverage of adsorbed oxygen species, and in turn the combustion of ethene and ethane. 4.1.5. Distribution o f reaction products The product distribution obtained over the 1 wt.-% Li20/TiO2 catalyst at 750 and 850 with a CH4/OZ ratio of 3 is illustrated in the form of C2H4/C2H6 (Fig. 5a) and CO/COZ (Fig. 5b) ratios as a function of methane conversion. It is apparent that at both temperatures the C2H4/C2H6 ratio increases with increasing methane conversion. This is probably due to ethane dehydrogenation which is favored at longer reactor space-times which are required to achieve higher methane conversions. The ethane dehydrogenation reaction is also favored at higher temperatures. However, this behavior of the C2H4/C2H6 ratio with increasing methane conversion can also be explained based on the following observations: the increase of methane conversion is of course accompanied by an increase of oxygen conversion as shown in Fig. 5a. At CHQ conversions in the range of 25-30% the oxygen conversion is in the range of 95-99%. The results of Tables 1 and 2 show that the rate of ethene combustion to carbon dioxide by lattice oxygen is much smaller than that obtained in the presence of gaseous oxygen, while the opposite is true for the case of ethane. Thus, under conditions of low oxygen pressure in the reactor (high oxygen conversions) ethane is oxidized more rapidly than ethene giving rise to higher C2H4/C2H6 ratios. However, the fact that at low oxygen concentrations dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene may be favored cannot be ruled out. Fig. 5b indicates that the CO/CO2 ratio decreases with increasing methane conversion at both reaction temperatures, while it increases with temperature. It should also be mentioned that at lower temperatures the selectivity towards carbon monoxide was found to be nearly independent of conversion, while the selectivity towards carbon dioxide was found to increase rapidly with increasing methane conversion. Furthermore, the reaction of ethane and ethene with lattice and adsorbed oxygen over the present catalysts was found to produce almost exclusively carbon dioxide [21,34]. Thus, the variation of the CO/COZ ratio with methane conversion can be attributed to carbon dioxide production by the interaction of ethane and ethene with the catalyst surface. It is also shown in Fig. 5b that the CO/COZ ratio is enhanced at higher temperatures. This observation is probably due to the fact that at 850 gas-phase combustion of ethane and ethene becomes important. It has been shown by Lane and Wolf [ 35 ] that these gas-phase reactions lead primarily to carbon monoxide, which would indeed increase the CO/CO, ratio. Another source of carbon monoxide might be water reforming of ethane and ethene which may become appreciable at higher temperatures. These reactions would also tend to increase the CO/COZ ratio with increasing temperature. 4.2. A comparison of the catalytic performance of Li' -doped Ti02 with other OCM catalysts It is difficult to compare the catalytic performance of the present Li +-doped Ti02 catalysts with that of other catalysts reported in the literature. This is primarily due to the fact that D. Papageorgiou et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 111 (1994) 41-62 59 (a) there are only limited reports on the stability of various catalysts that seem to have \"good\" catalytic performance under OCM reaction conditions, and (b) CZ-hydrocarbons selectivity vs. methane conversion results are rather limited in the literature. The latter relationship is essential in order to evaluate the catalyst performance correctly. Furthermore, many reports which have appeared in the literature have dealt with dilute feed mixtures of methane (i.e. Pss,4 < 0.1 bar). However, it is recognized that for practical and economic reasons the feed must be significantly more concentrated. It is well established that the general trend is that CZ-hydrocarbons selectivity and yield decrease with increasing methane partial pressure at the same CHQ/OZ ratio. In spite of these difficulties it can be stated that the performance of the present Li +-doped Ti02 catalyst (calcined at temperatures between 900 and 1000) competes well with that of Li /Mg0 [ 11,13,24], doped SM203 materials [ 11 ], various alkaline earth compounds [36], alkali-promoted oxides [29,37], and other catalytic systems reported in recent review papers [38-40]. 4.3. Some mechanistic aspects of the OCM reaction over Li +-doped T1OZ catalyst The transient results of Figs. 8 and 10 clearly demonstrate large differences in the kinetics of combustion of ethene and ethane to carbon dioxide over the lattice oxygen of undoped and Li +-doped Ti02 catalysts. The Li +-dopant has certainly affected the surface chemical properties of titania, which in turn has affected certain elementary steps of the reaction sequence of CZ-hydrocarbons combustion to carbon dioxide. Based on recent transient work reported elsewhere [34], it was suggested that the Li+-dopant affects more one of the oxidation steps of CH,, and/or CHx0 intermediate species, the latter formed after reaction of ethene or ethane with lattice oxygen, rather than one of the steps of the formation of these species (i.e. chemisorption of CZ-hydrocarbons and cleavage of C-C bond). It is shown in Fig. 10 that at 700 for both catalysts the reaction of ethane with lattice oxygen produces three peaks. For the case of Li +-doped Ti02 catalyst, we have extensively discussed the origin of these peaks in a previous publication [ 21 ] . In summary, peak 1 (overshoot at time zero) is consistent with the initially high surface concentration of lattice oxygen species and the formation of a very active CH, and/or CHx0 species. Peak 2 (formed after 4 min on stream) is due to the oxidation of carbonaceous species which have been accumulated in \"island\" forms during reaction. Diffusion of lattice oxygen from the bulk to the surface gives rise to a critical oxygen coverage, which results in a large rate enhancement of oxidation to carbon dioxide of the aforementioned carbonaceous species. Peak 3 (formed after 7 min on stream) may have the same origin as peak 2, but it may also be due to the oxidation of a less active carbonaceous species formed in a previous reaction time. In the case of undoped Ti02, peak 3 appears as a shoulder in Fig. 10, whereas the appearance of peak 2 occurs at a shorter time-on-stream. Based on a kinetic model presented elsewhere [21 ], the latter behavior is explained as due to the different activation energy of the ratelimiting step for the oxidation of the intermediate species, CH. and/or CH.O. A similar behavior is observed in Fig. 11, where the oxidation (in the presence of gaseous oxygen) at 845 of the carbonaceous intermediate species formed after reaction of ethane with lattice oxygen results in the appearance of the carbon dioxide peak maximum at different times-on-stream in oxygen flow for the undoped and Li +-doped Ti02 catalysts. 60 D. Papageorgiou et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 111 (1994) 41-62 The results presented in Table I show that there is a large enhancement in the combustion of ethene to carbon dioxide in the presence of gaseous oxygen. Based on other transient results reported elsewhere [ 34 ] , it was suggested that this is due to the decrease in the activation energy of oxidation of carbonaceous intermediate species formed. This, in turn, implies that adsorbed oxygen species become more active towards total oxidation of ethene than lattice oxygen species. The opposite behavior is illustrated in Table 2 for the case of ethane. These results, as already mentioned previously, are in harmony with the CA/CA product ratio behavior obtained under OCM reaction conditions (Fig. 5). Based on the reactivity results of C2H4/OZ and CA/% reactions (Tables 1 and 2) and the kinetic OCM results reported elsewhere [ 10], it is estimated that at 650 less than 5% of CZ-hydrocarbons react on the surface to give carbon dioxide under OCM reaction conditions. More of this subject is reported elsewhere [ 34] . The larger amounts of carbonaceous species accumulated on the surface of undoped Ti02 catalysts than on the Li +-doped ones after CA/He reaction (for the same experimental conditions), indicate again the significant effect of the Li +-dopant on the interaction of ethane molecule with the surface of titania. This different interaction is also illustrated in Fig. 10 via the transient kinetics of carbon dioxide formation following reaction of ethane with the surface lattice oxygen of the catalysts. Based on these remarks it is speculated whether the lower methane activity and also the significantly lower CZ selectivities obtained over the undoped Ti02, as compared to the 2 wt.-% Li20-doped Ti02 catalyst (Figs. 1 and 2), could be partly due to the larger accumulation of inactive carbonaceous species formed under OCM reaction conditions over the undoped than the Li +-doped Ti02 catalyst. We have recently reported on the surface coverages of the carbon- and oxygen-containing intermediate species formed under OCM reaction conditions over Li +-doped Ti02 using steady-state tracing techniques [ 41 ] . It was found that a very small amount of active carbon and a large amount of surface/ subsurface oxygen species which lead to carbon dioxide exist on the catalyst under reaction conditions. There is no reversibly adsorbed methane on the catalyst surface. However, it was found that a large amount of inactive (spectator) carbonaceous species accumulate on the surface after I h of reaction. The latter result may explain the decrease in methane activity reported in Fig. 6. 5. Conclusions The following conclusions may be drawn from the results of the present investigation. 1. Doping of rutile Ti02 with lithium cations in the range of 1-2 wt.-% Li20 results in promising stable catalysts for the oxidative coupling of methane. Their catalytic performance is comparable with that of other good catalysts reported in the literature. 2. An optimal level of doping for activity maximization (ca. 1 wt.-% Li20) and selectivity maximization (ca. 2 wt.-% Li20) exists. 3. For methane conversions in the range of 10-30%, a 0.5 bar methane pressure and a CH41 OZ ratio of 3, there is a monotonic increase of CZ-hydrocarbons selectivity with increasing reaction temperature in the range 750-900. 4. Product distribution in terms of CZHQ/CA and CO/COZ ratios is significantly affected by methane and oxygen conversions and reaction temperature. Unusually high CA/ CA ratios are obtained over the Li +-doped Ti02 catalysts at high reaction temperatures. D. Papageorgiou et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 111 (1994) 41-62 61 5. Reactivity results of ethene and ethane with both lattice and adsorbed oxygen species explain well the observed CZHc/CZH6 product ratio under OCM reaction conditions. 6. The Li +-dopant strongly affects the rate of combustion of ethene and ethane with lattice and adsorbed oxygen species (in the presence of gaseous oxygen), thus influencing CZhydrocarbons selectivity and yield. 7. Li +-doped Ti02 catalysts exhibit good stability, after approximately 8 h on stream, under OCM reaction conditions. 6.

The oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to C2-hydrocarbons was studied on a series of lithiumdoped titania catalysts by cofeeding methane (P CH 4 = 0.5 bar) and oxygen (P o 2 = 0.07–0.16 bar) at 1 bar total pressure in the temperature range of 750–900°C. The degree of lithium doping was varied between 0 and 4 wt.-% on Li2O basis. Electrical conductivity measurements confirmed that doping (i.e. incorporation of the Li+ cations into the crystal structure of TiO2) did indeed occur. At 900°C, a C2-hydrocarbons selectivity of the order of 70%, at a methane conversion level of 12%, was obtained over the 1 wt.-% Li2O-doped TiO2 catalyst. This catalytic performance stayed practically constant within a period of 72 h of continuous reaction. Transient kinetic studies of ethene and ethane reactions with the lattice (in the absence of gaseous oxygen) and adsorbed (in the presence of gaseous oxygen) oxygen species of undoped and Li+-doped TiO2 catalysts showed that adsorbed oxygen species are more reactive towards ethene than ethane, while lattice oxygen is more reactive towards ethane than ethene. These results explain well the C2H4/C2H6 product ratio obtained under OCM reaction conditions. It was also found that C2-hydrocarbons selectivity correlates well with surface acidity and basicity characteristics of the Li+ -doped TiO2 catalysts.
