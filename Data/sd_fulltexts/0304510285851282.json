The effects of all these parameters on the hydrogenation of the individual substrates and of their equimolar mixture were studied. It was found that the competitive hydrogenation of these substrates is a suitable model for determination of the selectivity of hydrogenation of the triple bond, even if very selective catalysts are used. The effects of the catalyst, carrier and solvent on the hydrogenation process are discussed. The palladium catalysts were much more selective in the hydrogenation of the triple bond than the platinum ones; the double bond of 1-heptene was isomerized on the former, and these catalysts also were somewhat more active. Introduction The selective hydrogenation of alkynic compounds to olefinic ones is used in many processes of organic technology. Often an apparently insig- nificant rise in selectivity may have considerable economic consequences: in most of these cases, not only are the original raw materials utilized more effectively, but the costs of separating the olefinic from the paraffinic products are lower. Palladium catalysts, which are most frequently used in industry for this purpose, possess high selectivity. Thus, it is experimen- tally demanding to detect apparently insignificant differences in the selec- tivity of palladium catalysts, caused e.g. by various treatments of the catalyst or by various reaction conditions, since in these catalysts the selectivity usually ranges above ca. 98%. The high selectivity of palladium catalysts is due to the high adsorptivity of the alkynic substrate, compared with that of the respective olefinic substrate [1]. The olefinic substrate which forms from the alkynic is removed from the catalyst surface by the original com- pound, and its hydrogenation takes place only at very low alkyne concen- tration in the reaction mixture. If, however, an olefinic substrate is used, 0304-5102/85/$3.30 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 34 the adsorptivity of which is much higher compared with the olefinic sub- strate obtained from the alkynic one, and if the former is capable of being competitively hydrogenated with the given alkyne, a system is obtained which provides a much larger amplitude for the investigation of selectivity changes, in this case of competitive hydrogenation between the triple and double bonds. If, moreover, the slowest process is the surface reaction, and not the establishment of adsorption equilibria, which is usual in hydrogena- tions of this type, the selectivity thus determined must be related to the selectivity of hydrogenation of the triple bond to the double bond. The advantage in this case is that the pair of compounds used in competitive hydrogenation may be chosen so as to leave a sufficiently wide amplitude for the usual investigation of the improvement of selectivity by various treatments. In this study, a model pair of substrates, viz., 2-octyne and 1-heptene, were chosen, where the a-olefinic bond is capable of competitive adsorption along with the disubstituted j3-alkynic bond, because its adsorptivity is much higher compared with the (3-olefinic bond arising from the alkyne. The system is somewhat complicated due to the fact that under the hydrogena- tion conditions, the double bond of 1-heptene is isomerized on palladium catalysts to the thermo dynamically more stable ^-position, which should be borne in mind in the evaluation. Experimental Catalysts The catalyst carriers used were active charcoal Supersorbon Degussa HB-3 (F.R.G.) and silica gel L 100/250 Lachema Brno (C.S.S.R.) in powder form, particle size < 0.063 mm. The carriers were impregnated with aqueous solutions of hexachloroplatinic acid or palladium(II) chloride, so that the amount of active metal in the catalysts thus prepared was a constant 5 wt.%.' Reductions were carried out at 150 and 250 C for the palladium and platinum catalysts respectively, in a reactor with a mobile catalyst layer [2]. Substrates 2-Octyne (Schuchardt, Munich) and 1-heptene (Koch-Light, England) were commercial products. They were freshly distilled before use and were chromatographically pure. Methanol and cyclohexane, analytical purity grade, Lachema Brno, were used as solvents in the hydrogenation. Apparatus and methods The hydrogenations were carried out in a standard apparatus [3] at 20 C and atmospheric pressure. The rate was observed by measuring the time dependence of hydrogen consumption together with changes in the concentration of reacting compounds with time, determined by chromatographic analysis using a Chrom-4 apparatus equipped with a 35 flame-ionization detector. A glass column, 3.5 m X 2.5 mm packed with 15% SE-31 on Chromaton NAW/DMCS, particle size 0.16 -0.20 mm, at 70 C was used in the experiments. Competitive hydrogenations were carried out, each time using 1.2 ml of an equimolar mixture of 2-octyne and 1- heptene and 10 ml of solvent; in the individual hydrogenations, 0.6 ml of substrate and 5 ml of solvent were used each time, the amount of the cata- lyst varying in the range between 5 and 30 mg. Results and discussion All measurements were carried out under conditions such that the reaction rate was not affected by mass transfer [4]. External diffusion was eliminated by sufficiently efficient stirring, while internal diffusion (if any) was strongly suppressed by the choice of a catalyst with small par- ticle size. In hydrogenations of the individual substrates, it was found that reac- tions of 2-octyne and 1-heptene differ in their kinetics. While the hydrogena- tion of 2-octyne was virtually zero order with respect to the concentration of the substrate up to high conversions of 2-octyne to 2-octene, the rate of hydrogenation of 1-heptene decreased slightly with increasing conversion. The effect was much more pronounced with Pd catalysts, as is illustrated in Fig. 1. One of the causes underlying the decrease in the rate of hydrogena- tion during the reaction is the isomerization of 1-heptene to 2-heptenes, which are hydrogenated more slowly than 1-heptene [1]. (The ratio between c;s and trans isomerization was not studied in this work.) On platinum catalysts no isomerization took place, and the decrease in the rate of hydro- genation of 1-heptene with time was also insignificant. 0 30 60 t (min) Fig. 1.

The values indicate that in all systems 1-heptene reacted more quickly than did 2-octyne. With all catalysts the reactions proceeded more quickly in methanol, in agreement with the generally accepted views regarding the effect of solvent on the course of catalytic hydrogenations [1]. Catalysts with a silica gel carrier were more active than those on active charcoal, and pal- ladium catalysts were more active than platinum ones. The ratio between the rates of hydrogenation of 2-octyne (r^g) and of hydrogenation and isomerization of 1-heptene (^7 resp. r,^) was somewhat higher on palladium catalysts than on platinum ones. Furthermore, equimolar mixtures of both substrates were hydro- genated in all systems. Typical time dependence curves of the concentrations of both compounds are shown in Fig. 2. From these dependences, the instantaneous concentrations of the initial compounds were read off, related to the initial concentrations and plotted in a system of coordinates cor- responding to the Rader-Smith relation for the calculation of the selectivity of competitive hydrogenation [5]: log (CA/CAO) ^ ^A-^A log (CB/CBO) k^Ky (1) where A = 2-octyne, B = 1-heptene, k = rate constant, K = adsorption coefficient, c concentration Since isomerization (on Pd catalysts) hydrogenation occurs on the catalytic surface with participation of hydrogen, selectivity had to be 0 20 trmin) W Fig. 2.

From the rates of hydrogenation and isomerization of 1-heptene at the beginning of the reaction, the selectivity values of hydrogenation with respect to isomerization were also determined (S; in Table 1). On platinum catalysts isomerization did not occur; on palladium catalysts it was con- siderable, and was more pronounced in polar methanol than in cyclohexane. From Figs. 3 and 4 it can be seen that the concentration dependences in Rader-Smith coordinates are not always linear, which is more obvious with cyclohexane as solvent; in a given solvent, this fact becomes more pronounced with palladium catalysts. Hence, it can be concluded that selectivity (above all on Pd catalysts in methanol) cannot be calculated using the Rader-Smith relation, because selectivity is not constant during the reaction, but varies with increasing conversion. For this reason, the usual calculation of relative adsorption coefficients using relation (1) is not possible, as these would vary in the course of the reaction. On plati- num catalysts the linear relation was much better satisfied. In all cases selectivity increases, i.e. the hydrogenation of 2-octyne is preferred. This phenomenon cannot be explained merely on the grounds of the non-identical kinetics of hydrogenation of the individual substrates, as in such cases the rate of hydrogenation of 1-heptene did not drop so markedly as would correspond, e.g., to the course of competitive hydro- genation with 2-octyne in cyclohexane on palladium catalysts (cf. Fig. 4). It can hardly be assumed that the reaction products (2-octene, octane, 2-heptenes, heptane) would lead to a larger decrease in the reactivity of 1-heptene than in that of 2-octyne. 39 Fig. 4. Concentration dependences in the course of competitive hydrogenation of 2- octyne (A) and 1-heptene (B) in cyclohexane. Catalysts as denoted in Fig. 3. Neither can this decrease be explained by isomerization, as the latter was more marked in methanol, while the selectivity of competitive hydro- genation varied markedly with the degree of conversion, mainly in cyclo- hexane. It seems, therefore, that a plausible explanation would require that both compounds be hydrogenated on Pd catalysts with other forms of hydrogen, at least in part, and that these forms should not be in equilibrium during the reaction. The existence of various forms of hydrogen on palla- dium catalysts is known [6-8], so that such an assumption is not unreal. A strong effect of the solvent on these phenomena, as documented by a comparison between Figs. 3 and 4, seems to be noteworthy. A similar behaviour has been observed with dienic-olefinic systems, in which diene behaves similarly to alkyne [9]. Since the selectivity of hydrogenation varied with the degree of con- version, the selectivity values at the beginning of the reaction were used, obtained by calculation from the initial reaction rates (cf. Table 1) read off from the time dependence of concentrations in competitive hydrogena- tion. The effect of the individual factors on the selectivity of catalysts resembled that observed in the individual hydrogenations. A basic differ- ence between both groups of catalysts along with the isomerization mentioned above is reflected in the considerably higher selectivity of hydrogenation of the triple bond on palladium, in agreement with gen- eral findings [10] regarding the selectivity of hydrogenation on metals of Group VIII. The study reported in this paper has shown that the method of com- petitive hydrogenation (analysed in detail in [11]) of a suitably chosen alkyne-alkene system may be very useful in testing the selectivity of hydro- genation of the triple bond, even with highly selective catalysts. 40 References 1 L.
