Herein, a novel catalyst was designed using the ILs and MOFs for the efficient CO2 cycloaddition reaction. The obtained IL@MIL-101(Cr) catalyst exhibits high catalytic efficiency (the per pass conversion of PC is about 30% and selectivity is over 99%) under ambient conditions. The mechanism reveals that the synergistic effect of ILs and MOF promotes the apparent reaction rate of the catalyst. The coupling of reaction and separation could be realized by introducing the mixture of CO2 and PO into the fixed-bed reactor with the precisely designed catalyst.

Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) have been developed to remove anthropogenic CO2 and valorize CO2 into commercially attractive production [7–15]. Among the processes related to CCUS, the CO2 fixation reactions to propylene carbonate (PC), as an atom economic reaction route, is trending research according to the literature reports [16–20]. PC obtained by CO2 fixation reaction could be applied to various fields, such as aprotic polar solvents, electrolytes for secondary batteries, intermediates for synthesis of some chemicals, and precursors for polymers, etc. [21]. However, the thermodynamic stability, high valent and kinetic inertness of CO2 lead to the low activity of catalyst under ambient conditions, which limits a large-scale industrial production of the PC from CO2 waste [22]. Ionic liquids (ILs), as potential catalysts in CO2 conversion, are composed of cations and anions. Due to the negligible volatility, high thermal stability, and the fine-tuning, ILs have excellent performance in CO2 fixation reaction and easy separation from the reaction system [23,24]. Typically, functional ILs based on imidazolium, pyridinium, phosphpnium or quaternary ammomium cations have the advantages of high activity, low volatility, good thermal stability, and ease of catalyst recovery and product purification [24–29]. Nevertheless, homogeneous catalytic reactions represented by ILs are facing challenges in the operation of chemical units for continuous production, mass transfer in gas-liquid phase interface, and “back-mixing” problem. Nanoconfined ILs is a simple but versatile strategy to overcome many problems of ILs in multipurpose [30]. Fortunately, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with good thermodynamic stability, large specific surface area, and uniform pore size may be more appropriate candidate carrier for the construction of nanoconfined ILs [31–36]. It may be a very good decision to use the confined ILs based on MOFs for CO2 cycloaddition. Confined ILs can simultaneously include a variety of catalytic active sites originated from designed IL and MOF materials, which can ensure the efficient of reaction. What is more, tuning the spatial distance between various active sites can also achieve the effect of synergistic catalysis [37,38]. Compared to the gas-liquid phase reaction based on ILs for CO2 cycloaddition, gas-solid phase reaction based on confined IL with large specific surface area is more conducive to mass transmission and catalytic rate. After fully considering the insolubility of designed IL in PC and physical properties of low boiling-point (307 K at 1.0 bar) of propene oxide (PO) and high boiling-point (515 K at 1.0 bar) of PC [39], such a delicate strategy is more beneficial to the chemical operation unit. Because the coupling of reaction and separation could be realized by introducing the mixture of reactants (CO2 and vaporized PO) into the fixed-bed reactor with the precisely designed IL@MOF catalyst. Not only that, gas-solid phase reaction based on the fixed-bed reactor with IL@MOF catalyst can reduce “back-mixing” problem and achieve continuous production comparing with gas-liquid phase reaction. Herein, a novel IL@MIL-101(Cr) catalyst was designed using the ILs ([BOHmim][Zn2Cl5], 1-(4-hydroxy-butyl)-3-methylimidazolium chlorozincate) and stable MOF (MIL-101(Cr)) for the efficient CO2 cycloaddition reaction (as shown in Scheme 1 ) without using any solvent. The obtained IL@MIL-101(Cr) catalyst exhibits high CO2 cycloaddition reaction efficiency (the per pass conversion of PC is about 30% and selectivity is over 99%) under ambient conditions (298 K and 1.2 bar). The mechanism reveals that Zn and Cl in ILs play important role in the intrinsic kinetics of chemical reactions while porous skeleton of MIL-101(Cr) is favorable for the internal and external diffusion of guest molecule. Such the synergistic effect of ILs and MOF promotes the high reaction activity of the catalyst. More importantly, the coupling of reaction and separation was realized based on designed catalyst and fixed-bed reactor. In this regard, such a novel way to develop catalysts for chemical fixation of CO2 based on the advantages of ILs and MOFs is very attractive from both green industrial and academic viewpoints. 2 Experimental section Reagents and Materials: All reagents and solvents used in this work were commercially available and used as supplied without special purification. The source and purity of all chemicals used were listed in revised Supporting Information (SI, 1.1 Preparation of materials). 2.1 Preparation of materials The synthesis of MIL-101(Cr) adopted the hydrothermal synthesis process reported by Férey, G. et al. [40]. The synthesis of [BOHmim][Zn2Cl5] adopted two-step method, which is similar to the method reported in the literature [41]. Firstly, 1-(4-hydroxy-butyl)-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([BOHmim][Cl]) was synthesized by the N-alkylation reaction. Secondly, the mixture of [BOHmim][Cl] and ZnCl2 at a mole ratio of 1:2 was heated in a dry N2 atmosphere. As for [BOHmim][Zn2Cl5]@MIL-101(Cr), [BOHmim][Zn2Cl5] was loaded into MIL-101(Cr) powder when methanol (CH3OH) was used as dispersant. The resulting sample was dried in an oven at 378 K overnight after CH3OH was evaporated. Detailed synthesis approaches of MIL-101(Cr), [BOHmim][Zn2Cl5] and IL@MIL-101(Cr) catalyst can be found in the Supporting Information (SI). 2.2 Characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the samples were measured on a Bruker D8 Advance instrument with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å). The data of N2 adsorption/desorption were determined with a Micromeritics ASAP 2460 physisorption analyzer with degassing temperature of 373 K under vacuum overnight. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy analyses of the samples were performed by Thermo Scientific FT-IR spectrophotometer. The chemical elements and components of materials were investigated through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements (XPS, Thermo Scientific K-Alpha). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was conducted by ZEISS Gemini 300 instrument to investigate the morphology of the samples. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were taken by JEOL JEM-F200. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was conducted on JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope. The data of catalytic performance for catalyst were determined with the self-built catalytic device. The liquid products were identified with a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC–MS) (Agilent 7890A/5975B) equipped with capillary of HP-5MS. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out on a Discovery TGA 550 instrument under N2 atmosphere. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of IL@MIL-101(Cr) catalyst As shown in Scheme 1, the IL@MIL-101(Cr) catalyst consists of MIL-101(Cr) and [BOHmim][Zn2Cl5]. ILs are dispersed on the inner and outer surfaces of MOF materials to fully expose the catalytic active sites. It can be found that the catalyst was successfully synthesized as expected through the analysis of characterization results. At the outset, the powder XRD (PXRD) patterns of IL@MIL-101(Cr) catalyst are depicted in Fig. 1a, which shows that the experimental PXRD patterns of IL@MIL-101(Cr) basically match the experimental and simulated ones of MIL-101(Cr). As for the weak characteristic peaks of catalyst at 5–7°, which may be attributed to the IL incorporation. The XRD patterns of the catalyst after removal of IL by CH3OH washing can be basically consistent with the one of original MIL-101(Cr), indicating that the characteristic peaks at 5–7° are affected by ILs. In a word, PXRD patterns demonstrate that the obtained catalyst maintains the structure of MIL-101(Cr). What is more, FT-IR, XPS, and N2 adsorption of catalyst further demonstrate the successful ILs incorporation into MIL-101(Cr). As depicted in Fig. 1b, the catalyst shows additional peaks at 3131 cm−1 and 1548 cm−1 corresponding to ν(OH) and νs(C=C) of ILs [42]. Based on XPS analyses (Fig. S1), Zn and Cl characteristic peaks of [BOHmim][Zn2Cl5] appeared in IL@MIL-101(Cr) catalyst [43]. Some ILs are grafted onto Cr unsaturated metal sites of MIL-101(Cr) by electrostatic interaction. The change in binding energy (from 576.6 eV to 577.2 eV) at the Cr2p peak (as shown in the Fig. S2) indicates the interactions between IL and the metal sites in MIL-101(Cr). The porous structure of MIL-101(Cr) and IL@MIL-101(Cr) catalyst were detected by N2 adsorption−desorption isotherms at 77 K (as shown in Fig. 1c). The evaluated BET surface areas are 3241 m2g−1 for MIL-101(Cr) and 600 m2g−1 for IL@MIL-101(Cr) catalyst, respectively. Distribution curves of pore size (as shown in Fig. 1d) based on N2 adsorption isotherms confirm ILs exists in the pores of MIL-101(Cr). ILs are not only present in the inner side of the pore, but also in the outer side, which is proved by TEM images (as shown in Fig. S3). HRTEM image clearly reveals lattice fringes and well-ordered two-dimensional arrays of IL@MIL-101(Cr) with highly crystalline porous structure (as shown in Fig. S4. a), which is similar to that of MIL-101(Cr). This illustrates that the nanostructure of MIL-101(Cr) remained intact after ILs incorporation. The dimensions of the IL@MIL-101(Cr) crystals ranged from 50 nm down to 5 nm. It was difficult to estimate the porosity and ILs dispersion when obtaining accurate ILs distribution histograms (as shown in Fig. S4. b). The fine details were not observed in the HRTEM image because of the strong drift due to the charging [44], extremely sensitive to the electron beam [45], the minimum exposure time and the poor ILs-support contrast when ILs were embedded in the cages of MIL-101(Cr). SEM images of MIL-101(Cr) and IL@MIL-101(Cr) catalyst are shown in Fig. 1e. The size integrities and morphologies are similar in MIL-101(Cr) and IL@MIL-101(Cr) catalyst. 3.2 Catalytic details and performance of catalyst In view of the specific production of PC, comprehensive considerations are as follows: (1) The reaction form by horizontal flow can reduce back-mixing and improve reaction efficiency. (2) Continuous production is more favorable than batch production. (3) Controlling the reaction temperature between the boiling points of PC and PO can realize the coupling of reaction and separation and reduce the chemical operation units. Based on these, catalytic performance of catalyst was determined by self-built catalytic device (as shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. S5). The general operation is as follows: The high-purity CO2 (1) enters the flowmeter (3) through the regulation of the valve (2). The formed quantitative CO2 enters the PO solution (5) (298 K) in the form of bubbling and carries the vaporized PO into the fixed-bed reactor (7) (298 K). The gas mixture (CO2 and PO) passes through the fixed-bed reactor equipped with IL@MIL-101(Cr) catalyst (8) in the form of horizontal flow, and the generated PC (10) with high boiling-point flows down in drops. The unreacted mixture (9) is collected for treatment and can be used for the next cycle. Specific parameters and details are shown in SI (1.2 Procedure for CO2 cycloaddition reaction). Under the stable environmental conditions, about 0.5 mL·min−1 PO was steadily carried by 1.5 mL·s−1 CO2 into fixed-bed reactor with 10 mm internal diameter (the filling height of 1.70 g activated catalyst is about 37 mm). Due to the large porosity (about 77%) of the fixed-bed, there is only slight pressure difference (0.2 bar) between the upper and lower sides of the fixed-bed. CO2, as carrier gas, had an appreciable flux of 2.5 cm·s−1. During the experiment, the catalyst was gradually wetted from top to bottom, and the liquid product drips down very slowly from the end of the fixed-bed. Finally, a total of 1.86 g liquid product was produced. The per pass conversion rate (about 30%) of PO was calculated based on the feed rate of PO and the production rate of liquid product. The high per pass yield (30%) and high selectivity (> 99%) of PC were further calculated through the characterization data of the liquid product based on methods reported in literature (detailed approaches can be found in the SI) [46]. Also, the obtained catalyst exhibits high TOF value (49.2 h−1), which are higher than those reported catalysts (such as: MIL-101-N(Bnme2)Br, TOF = 20.2 h−1; UiO-66-10TFA, TOF = 6.4 h−1) [47–49]. Not only that, the idea about rapid chemical fixation of CO2 under ambient conditions (298 K and 1.2 bar) based on the coupling of reaction and separation was achieved by the designed catalyst. By removing the coordinated water molecules, the exposed Cr3+ centers are capable of acting as Lewis acid sites for cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides [20,50]. Herein, the controlled experiment was carried out to analyze the contribution of Cr3+ centers of MIL-101(Cr) for this reaction system. 1.70 g IL@MIL-101(Cr) was replaced with 1.70 g MIL-101(Cr) and put into fixed-bed reactor. The feed condition of CO2 and PO, reaction temperature (298 K) and reaction pressure (1.2 bar) remain unchanged. However, no liquid product drips out in more than three times of the reaction time. SO, we speculate that MIL-101(Cr) has lower reactivity than IL@MIL-101(Cr). In particular, ILs were grafted onto Cr3+ centers. The Cr3+ centers were theoretically covered by the large loading ratio of ILs (40 wt%). It is difficult to play a role in CO2 catalysis for the covered Cr3+ centers. MIL-101 (Cr) mainly acts as a carrier in this research, and is used for highly dispersed active centers. To date, a wide range of functional ILs catalysts for the synthesis of PC have been explored [27,38,51–53]. G. Chen et al. [42] reported the [Hmim]2[ZnBr4] catalyst with a high yield (99%) and selectivity (> 99%) of PC at 298 K for 5 h. R. Santiago et al. [24] reported the [P66614][2-CNPyr] catalyst with a high yield (85%) at 393 K and 20 bar for 22 h. Y. Wu et al. [29] reported the [bmim]Br/H2O catalyst with a high yield (> 99%) and selectivity (> 99%) of PC at 413 K and 30 bar for 2.8 min. B.-H. Xu et al. listed 13 catalysts for PO, which all require higher temperature, higher pressure or longer reaction time (such as CS–ZnCl2/BMImBr: 383 K, 15 MPa, 1 h) [21]. The catalytic efficiency and reaction conditions of 11 catalysts for the cycloaddition of CO2 were compared by S.K. Das et al. Similarly, more harsh conditions are required in terms of temperature, pressure or reaction time (such as Zn@SBMMP: 353 K, 2 MPa, 10 h) than ambient conditions [54]. Although the per pass conversion is not as high as the catalyst in the literature mentioned, the catalyst designed in this work can be applied to more mild reaction conditions (298 K and 1.2 bar) and shorter reaction time. More importantly, the coupling of reaction and separation could be realized by introducing the mixture of reactants (CO2 and vaporized PO) into the fixed-bed reactor, which means that pure PC can be obtained directly. In this regard, such a novel strategy to develop catalysts for chemical fixation of CO2 is very meaningful from both catalyst design and intensification of reaction and separation processes. 3.3 Mechanism of CO2 cycloaddition Encouraged by the efficient performance, the deep-seated study was carried out for underlying mechanism of CO2 cycloaddition. To probe the binding states and qualitative chemical compositions of guest molecules in IL@MIL-101(Cr) catalyst, Zn 2p XPS was investigated (as shown in Fig. 3a). A slight red-shift (about 0.3 eV) occurred for Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 after the introduction of PO into catalyst, which indicates the weak interaction between PO and Lewis acid site of zinc (I) [55–57]. Furthermore, the ZnO peak at 420–460 cm−1 in FT-IR spectra (Fig. S6) is hard to be found after the introduction of PO, proving that there is only weak interaction between Zn and O [58]. The weak interaction may be more conducive to PC desorption from active site. Fig. 3b-d show the FT-IR spectra of different functional groups in IL@MIL-101(Cr) before and after reaction. The characteristic peak at 1029 cm−1 (Fig. 3b) corresponds to CCl [59], which indicates that Cl− in [Zn2Cl5]− effects the ring opening of PO. The characteristic peak at 1673 cm−1 corresponds to CO of MIL(metal-ILs)-O-CO2, which can be attributed to the formation of intermediate products related to the complex of CO2 and PO [42]. The characteristic peak at 1784 cm−1 corresponding to CO of PC demonstrates the generation of PC. The high apparent reaction rate also benefits from suitable carriers. MIL-101(Cr) (BET = 3241 m2g−1), as the carrier of the catalyst, dispersed the active sites of ILs to a great extent. The porous skeleton of MIL-101(Cr) is favorable for the internal and external diffusion of guest molecule. According to the above research, a possible mechanism is shown in Fig. 4 . Initially, PO is adsorbed on Lewis acid site of zinc (I). Concurrently, nucleophile Cl− in [Zn2Cl5]− attacks on the β‑carbon atom of PO with less steric hindrance and promotes the ring-opening of PO (II). Subsequently, CO2 is inserted into the ring-opening intermediate of PO and Zn (III). Finally, PC is formed and desorbed (IV). Simultaneously, the catalyst is regenerated. 3.4 Stability and reusability of the catalyst TGA (Fig. 5a) shows that the catalyst underwent two steps of weight loss. The first step shows about 15% weight loss before approximately 450 K. The weight loss can be attributed to the H2O molecules adsorbed in catalyst because the catalyst has good hydrophilicity (the H2O contact-angle is shown in Fig. S7). In general, the MIL-101(Cr), IL@MIL-101(Cr) catalyst, and the catalyst after the reaction can maintain good stability until 600 K. SEM image (Fig. 5b) of IL@ MIL-101(Cr) catalyst after the reaction maintained the initial morphology. ILs originally located on the surface are still intact outside the catalyst after reaction (the TEM image is shown in Fig. S8). PXRD patterns (Fig. 5c) of IL@ MIL-101(Cr) catalyst before and after reaction match well. All the characterization results demonstrate the good thermal and chemical stability. To prove the reusability of IL@MIL-101(Cr) catalyst, its performance for PC synthesis was repeated (as shown in Fig. 5d). Prior to each cycle, the sample was heated at 373 K under vacuum (10−4 bar). Then, it was kept for 10 h to thoroughly remove the guest molecules. The catalytic performance can be maintained without obvious reduction over 5 cycles. As shown in Fig. S9. The experiments of different batches show that the good reproducibility of the catalyst synthesis. And, the catalytic performance also remains basically unchanged. 4 Conclusions In summary, a novel IL@MIL-101(Cr) catalyst was elaborately designed and successfully synthesized using [BOHmim][Zn2Cl5] and MIL-101(Cr). It realized the rapid chemical fixation of CO2 under ambient conditions (298 K and 1.2 bar). A variety of characterization methods were used to systematically explore the basic characteristic and catalytic mechanism. After fully considering the principle of chemical operation unit and physical properties of PC and PO, coupling of reaction and separation was realized by the fixed-bed reactor equipped with IL@MOF-101(Cr) catalyst. Not only that, the IL@ MIL-101(Cr) catalyst can reduce “back-mixing” problem, achieve continuous production and shorten the residence time comparing with gas-liquid phase reaction based on pure ILs. This work provides a general way to develop catalysts for chemical fixation of CO2 based on the advantages of ILs and MOFs.

        "dc:description": "It is of great significance to valorize anthropogenic CO2 into commercially attractive production. Herein, a novel catalyst was designed using the ILs and MOFs for the efficient CO2 cycloaddition reaction. The obtained IL@MIL-101(Cr) catalyst exhibits high catalytic efficiency (the per pass conversion of PC is about 30% and selectivity is over 99%) under ambient conditions. The mechanism reveals that the synergistic effect of ILs and MOF promotes the apparent reaction rate of the catalyst. The coupling of reaction and separation could be realized by introducing the mixture of CO2 and PO into the fixed-bed reactor with the precisely designed catalyst.",
