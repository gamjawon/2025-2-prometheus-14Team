Graphical abstract The UV/vis absorption spectral study of two highly aggregating phthalocyaninatocobalts in neutral, acidic or oxidative conditions revealed that the protonation and decompositions of their aggregations are more difficult than those of monomers, and the aggregations always dissolved into their monomers before being protonated or decomposed. Highlights ► Two highly aggregating phthalocyaninatocobalts were synthesized and separated. ► Both of them were confirmed by MS and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. ► The aggregations of both phthalocyanines are more stable than their monomers. ► The aggregations are always disassembled into the monomers before being protonated. ► The aggregations are always disassembled into the monomers before being decomposed. Two unsymmetrical phthalocyanines (Pcs) having a strong tendency toward forming aggregations were synthesized and the electronic absorption spectral studies revealed that their monomers are much easier to be protonated or decomposed than the aggregations in acidic or oxidative conditions. Before being protonated or decomposed, the aggregations are always disassembled into the monomers in the solutions. This conclusion is undoubtedly of considerable realistic significance for the practical application as molecular catalysis. Keywords Phthalocyanines Aggregation Chemical stability 1 Introduction Metal-phthalocyanines (MPcs), particularly those contain redox-active central metals (e.g. FePcs, CoPcs, et al.), are excellent molecular catalysts for oxidative desulfurization of hydrocarbons [1]. In the past decades, these unique complexes have also been examined as biologically simulated oxidative metalloenzymes [2]. Among these applications, those with high chemical stability are required. In our previous publications [3–5], we have carefully investigated the chemical stabilities and decomposition mechanisms of non-aggregating MPcs in acid or oxidative conditions, which revealed that those with substituents of strong electronic donating and central metals of strong coordination ability were less stable. Indeed, for some practical applications, Pcs are used in solid state or aggregations in solutions. However, few examples until now dealt with the chemical stability of the Pc aggregations. Herein, we give a report to compensate this loss. For the realization of this concept, we have synthesized a pair of aggregating CoPcs with only one benzene ring substituted by two alkoxy groups, whose monomers and aggregations can coexist in solutions. The UV/vis absorption spectroscopy revealed that the aggregations of Pcs are more stable than their monomers in acidic or oxidative solutions. Before being protonated or decomposed, the aggregations are always disassembled into the monomers. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and measurements Unsubstituted phthalonitrile and DBU (1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene) were purchased from Aldrich. Substituted phthalonitriles were synthesized according to the methods reported in literature [6,7]. Other reagents and solvents were used without further purification. All synthetic reactions were performed under nitrogen atmosphere. The infrared spectra were recorded in the range of 400–4000cm−1 on Perkin–Elmer FT-IR spectrophotometer. And elemental analyses were carried out on a Vario EL III elemental analyses instrument. The ESI mass spectra were measured with a FINNIGAN LCQ DECA XP MAX spectrometer and UV/vis spectra were recorded on a PE-Lambda 9 UV/vis spectrophotometer using 1cm path length cuvettes at room temperature. 2.2 General synthetic procedure for 1–2 A mixture of unsubstituted phthalonitrile (30mmol), respective substituted phthalonitrile (5mmol), anhydrous CoCl2 (17mmol) and DBU (4mL) in n-pentanol (100mL) was heated at 160°C for 10h. The solvents were removed in vacuo and the resultant residue was washed with methanol and toluene repeatedly until the eluate was light green. Then the residue was extracted using THF and purified by column chromatography (silica gel, THF as eluent). A green band was collected and the solvent was evaporated to give a crude product, which was further purified by recrystallization using THF/MeOH as solvent affording the dark-green target products. 1,4-di(iso-propoxy)phthalocyaninatocabalt (1): Yield: 7.7%; anal. calcd. for C38H28CoN8O2: C 66.38, H 4.10, N 16.30; found: C 66.55, H 3.95, N 16.51; MS (ESI): m/z 687.61 (M+, 100%); IR (ν, cm−1): 1596 (CN), 1523 (CC), 1284 (Ar-O-C), 913 (Co-N); UV/vis (chloroform/nm): 326, 619, 682. 1,4-di(iso-butoxy)phthalocyaninatocabalt (2): Yield: 8.2%; anal. calcd. for C40H32CoN8O2: C 67.13, H 4.51, N 15.66; found: C 66.43, H 3.95, N 15.63; MS (ESI): m/z 715.67 (M+, 100%); IR (ν, cm−1): 1606 (CN), 1523 (CC), 1287, 1272 (Ar-O-C), 913 (Co-N); UV/vis (chloroform/nm): 324, 665, 685. 2.3 X-ray crystallography The diffraction data for compound 1 was collected on a Rigaku Raxis-Rapid Imaging Plate Diffractometer with a graphite-monochromated Mo-Kα (λ =0.071069nm) in the range of 3.10–27.56° at room temperature. The data intensity was corrected for LP factors without absorption correction.

And those in oxidative condition were examined under the same procedure but replacing TFA by the oxidant benzoylperoxide (BPO). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis As shown in Scheme 1 , in presence of organic base DBU and inorganic cobalt chloride, a statistical cyclotetramerization of phthalonitrile and 3,6-di(iso-propoxy)phthalonitrile (or 3,6-di(iso-butyloxy)phthalonitrile) [7] in n-pentanol led to compound 1 or 2, respectively. For such synthetic approach, the ratio of the two precursors is known to play the most important role to the product distributions. For example, a molar ratio of 6:1 was adopted in this work so that to generate large amounts of unsubstituted and monosubstituted CoPcs, which could be separated easily by filtration. The obtained substituted CoPcs could be further separated by column chromatography affording the final products. 3.2 Crystal structures of compound 1 Crystals of 1 were obtained upon slow evaporation of a pyridine solution of 1 at room temperature. The molecular structure of compound 1 was unequivocally assigned by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis (Fig. 1a). Different from the common substituted MPcs possessing a distorted ring skeleton, [9] that of compound 1 basically maintained planar conformation with all atoms distance to the plane within 0.5Å, which might be attributed to the pyridine coordination at the axis. The distances between the N atom of pyridines and the center atom Co are 2.443Å and 2.347Å respectively, which are longer than the distances between the atom N of isoindoles and the center Co atom (1.937Å, 1.915Å, 1.932Å and 1.917Å). Comparing the four lengths of Co-N (isoindole), the lengths of Co-N(1) and Co-N(3) are slightly longer than that of Co-N(2) and Co-N(4) because of the hauling electron effect of the alkoxy groups. In the crystal, along the x axis, the neighboring two molecules were overlapped each other with a distance of ca. 3.5Å to form a one-dimensional molecule chain (Fig. 1b). For every molecules, the pyridine molecules near the alkoxy groups are somewhat tilted as a result of the pushing of the neighbor molecules’ alkoxy groups, where the included angles between the planes of pyridine and Pc rings are 79.468° (those of the opposite pyridines are 87.418°). 3.3 Electronic spectra in different solvents The electronic absorption spectra of compound 1 in different solvents are shown in Fig. 2 and the detailed data for both compounds are collected in Table 1 . Compared with the unsubstituted CoPc, the contributions of alkoxy substituents on their electronic absorption spectra were rather distinct and ca. 9nm bathochromic shift for each alkoxyl group at α position were observed. It is worth pointing out that, different from the spectra of the common symmetrical MPcs holding a typical Q0-0 and Soret bands of Pc ring, those of compounds 1 and 2 showed a new band (named as SW bands) at the shorter wavelength side of the Q band in the new preparation solutions, particularly those using the coordinate solvents (e.g. THF, DMF and Py), which may be attributed to the aggregation. This is indeed supported by the mass spectra, for example, the abundance of the dimer ion peak of compound 1 in THF is more than 80%. Furthermore, the phenomena that such bands could be disappeared after standing in air for about one week for those from the coordination solvents, but not for non-coordination solvents, also confirmed the deduction that the aggregation of MPcs account for the S bands. Considering the high solubility in chloroform but clear coexistence of Q bands and S bands, the chemical stability experiments of compounds 1 and 2 in acidic and oxidative conditions were performed in chloroform. 3.4 Spectra and stabilities in TFA/chloroform MPcs are a class of potential bases because their four meso nitrogen atoms can be protonated under acidic conditions. When protonation, a new absorption band (named as X band) assigned to the mono-protonated MPcs always could be detected at the longer wavelength side of the Q band [5,11]. Similarly, for compounds 1 and 2, the X bands referred to the mono-protonation of monomers were also observed upon addition of TFA, however, no other bands in line with the aggregations were found (Fig. 3 , where the concentrations of CoPcs are 3.5×10−6 mol/L and the concentrations of TFA are shown in the insets). Owing to the spectral intensity of the Q bands decreasing much faster than those of the S bands upon protonation, only S bands left when Q bands almost disappeared upon addition of around 50×10−3 mol/L TFA. Although S bands could continue decreasing with the increasing intensities of X bands, the rates were much smaller. Based on these observations, a deduction that the aggregations were disassembled into their monomers through a procedure of ( MPc ) n ⇌ K a n MPc ⇌ K p n MPcH + before being protonated could be drawn, where the protonation rate K p is very fast and the aggregation rate K a is the determination step. It is known that the chemical stabilities of MPcs are always lower after protonation [5,12]. Recently, we have studied carefully chemical stability of some mono-protonated MPcs bearing four alkoxy substituents at α position in acidic condition [5] and found their decomposition rates depend on their protonation extent, axial coordination ability of central metals and intensity of their CN bonds. However, compounds 1 and 2 are rather stable after protonation and no any decomposition was observed even by standing in air for about one week, which agrees with the fact that the traditional unsubstituted Pcs can be purified by precipitation from their acid solution repeatedly [13,14]. It is reported that the alkoxy substituents at the α-position can expand the Pc ring, increase the CN bond lengths and weaken their intensities. [10] In the case of compounds 1 and 2, only two alkoxy substituents at the α-position, such weakening are rather trivial. 3.5 Spectra and stabilities in BPO/chloroform Considering that CoPcs are famous molecular catalysts for the degradation of organic pollutants in presence of the oxidizers (BPO, oxygen, et al.), the studies of their chemical stabilities, particularly of the aggregations, in oxidative conditions is undoubtedly of considerable realistic significance. As shown in Fig. 4 , compounds 1 and 2 are found to be decomposed in BPO/chloroform exhibiting the intensities of the Q bands and S bands decreased. For compound 1, a new band at 701nm (named as LW bands) was found at the longer wavelength side of Q band, and its intensity increase accompanied the intensity decreasing of Q bands and SW bands. This new band has been assigned to an intermediate where the BPO are bridged at the center atom and their meso N atom [4]. For compound 2, some broader bands at the longer wavelength were found around the position of that LW bands, and their intensities also increase with the reducing of Q bands and S bands. However, the UV–visible spectroscopy revealed that the different decomposition rates of the monomers and the aggregations in BPO/chloroform for both compounds. For the monomers, same as the non-aggregating substituted CoPcs [4], their decomposition rates are fast and have a good linear fitting of 1/A against the time (Fig. 5a), where A is the intensities of their Q bands. But the aggregations decompose slowly and their decomposition rates possess a good fitting of ln(A) against the time (Fig. 5b), where A is the intensities of their S bands. It was reported that the decomposition rate of BPO in solution is about 0.0650 [15,16]. Thus, the concentration of the activated BPO in our experiments is about 10−5 mol/L, which is close to the concentration of compounds 1 and 2. As a result, the decompositions of the monomers are a second-order reactions that are controlled by the activated BPO and MPcs with the mechanisms reported previously [4]. And the aggregations are supposed to be decomposed following the pathway: ( MPc ) n ⇌ K a n MPc ⟶ K d Decomposition products where the decomposition rates (K d ) of the monomer are much higher than the dissolution rates (K a ) of aggregations into monomers. So the K a is the determination step and the reaction is seemingly shown as a first-order kinetic. Furthermore, although the decompositions of both monomers of compounds 1 and 2 are in second-order reaction, their rates are different and sorted by a sequence of 2 > 1, which is in good agreement with the order of their maximum absorption wavelengths and same as the general non-aggregating substituted phthalocyanines [4]. For the aggregations, the decomposition of compound 2 is much faster than that of compound 1 because the former hold a larger steric congestion of substituents. 4 Conclusions In summary, we have successfully synthesized two aggregating unsymmetrical CoPcs, whose one benzene ring was substituted by two alkoxy groups, through a statistical cyclotetramerization of phthalonitrile and substituted phthalonitriles. The electronic absorption spectral studies revealed that the protonation and decompositions of their aggregations are much more difficult than those of monomers, and the aggregations always dissolved into their monomers before being protonated or decomposed. This conclusion is undoubtedly of considerable realistic significance for the practical applications of MPcs, such as catalysis, chemical sensors, et al.
