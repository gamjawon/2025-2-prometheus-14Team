Ruthenium compounds as catalysts S. Chocron and M. Michman* Department of Organic Chemistry, The Institute of Chemistry, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 91904 (Israel) (Received June 25, 1990; revised October 18, 1990) Abstract The indirect anodic oxidation of 2-methylnaphthalene and naphthalene to 2-methylnaphthoquinone-1,4 and naphthoquinone, respectively, was carried out with RUC13 - 31120, Ru(acac)3 and Ru(NHq)ZCIg as catalysts, in an undivided cell using platinum electrodes. Current-potential analysis of the hydrocarbon shows two oxidation waves in solutions of acetonitrile-HZSOq which collapse into a single wave in presence of water, implying an electrodic-chemical-electrodic (ECE) reaction sequence. RuC13 - 31120 or Ru(NH4)aClo increases the selectivity for quinone formation, whereas Ru(acach has no such effect. Voltammetry shows that RuC13 - 31120 and Ru(acac)3 oxidize water and not the hydrocarbon. It also identifies an activated complex in which RuC13 - 3Hz0, but not Ru(acac)3, binds to the oxidised form of the hydrocarbon. This analysis explains the catalytic effect of RuC13 - 31120 and the inefficiency of the coordinatively saturated Ru(acac)3. RuC13 - 31120 is also an efficient catalyst in non-acidic solutions containing high concentrations of diisobutylamine and diisopropylamine and in which oxidation of 2-methylnaphthalene to 2-methylnaphthoquinone-1,4 is possible at a very low potential. Introduction Batch oxidations by chemical reagents frequently involve safety and environmental problems. Organic electrooxidation [ 1, 2 ] could be an attractive alternative for such methods, in so far as it can circumvent the use of poisonous metals or peroxides, high temperature and pressure. The advantage in safety is particularly evident since electrooxidation is carried out in mild conditions and is suited for continuous operation. Yet it frequently suffers from low selectivity. Low selectivity may be corrected by any of several contrivances. One such method is indirect electrolysis, in which a mediator for electron transfer is activated between the electrode and the substrate [3] and indeed considerable interest has been given in recent years to the initiation of homogeneous catalysts which can be recycled by electrodic reactions [4, 5]. Selectivity can also be obtained by creating electrogenerated reagents [6], which are produced electrodically at relatively low potentials and have consequent (selective) chemical reactions with a given substrate. *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/91/$3.50 0 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 86 Catalysis at the electrode surface and the use of modified electrodes are also of great importance [7]. Since the electrodic process is affected at different stages, e.g. the electrode surface, the double layer, the medium or the sequence of reactions, different effects may operate simultaneously yet their experimental distinction, though it may not be complete, is illustrative whenever it enables the characterization of the associated catalytic process. The oxidation of 2-methylnaphthalene (1) to 2-methylnaphthoquinone1,4 (2) (eqn. 1) is a relevant case. The oxidation of 1 to 2 - which is the parent compound of the Vitamin K group - is commonly carried out with chromic acid [8] or peroxides [9]. Use of these reagents involves batch procedures as well as disposal and safety problems. Because of this and because it is suitable for continuous operation, electrochemical oxidation [ 10 ] is a possible alternative, but would become attractive only if selectivity and yields of 2 are improved. The requirement for division of the electrolysis cell [ 10 ], which is often regarded as a precondition, adds a significant practical detriment; dispensing with this requirement would add expediency to the anodic process. Attempts at the electrooxidation of 1 as well as of naphthalene have been made since the turn of the century. In typical recent procedures, the anodic oxidation of 1 to 2 takes place with low selectivity. Values of 30 10% are common and are very dependent on type of electrode and electrolyte [10]. Formation of other products, such as binaphthyl, from dimerization of the radical-cation, is a main cause of low selectivity in 2. For this reason we pursued catalysts for the oxidation of water rather than 1 (eqn. 1) with the anticipation for enhanced aromatic hydroxylation by electrogenerated hydroxy radicals. The indirect electrooxidation of 1 to 0 00 CH3 + H20 ' 2e I CH3 [~CH3 12 O 2 (1) ca 1 2 was therefore studied using ruthenium salts as catalysts. Results of this study imply that only catalysts capable of oxidizing water and binding the oxidized hydrocarbon at the same time can effectively increase selectivity for 2. Ruthenium salts were chosen for the following reasons: the availability of several oxidation states within a small energy range, the capacity for a reversible electron transfer by Ru(acac)3 and the low overpotential for the oxidation of water by RuCl3 - 3H20 [ 11 ] and; as found here, by Ru(acac)3. Voltammetric analysis provides some elucidation of the nature of catalysis involved, such as a rationalization of the initial electrodic step, and some insight into consequent reactions. The present objective was explicitly to study the effect of catalyst on the formation of 2 regarding the mode of catalyst action as it is reflected by voltammetric analysis, and by differences in rates rather than reaction yields. Choice of reaction conditions in this study was meant to be optimal for voltammetry and for comparisons under a number of variables; Pt electrodes were found most suitable for this. Yields 87 of 2 in the present study are in the range of 2-1095 after converting 50-6090 of 1. Although far from optimal, they are 5-10 fold improved over uncatalysed runs. Methods for obtaining high yields on a preparative scale resulting from the present study are discussed in a subsequent paper. Experimental For electrochemical analysis and reactions, a PO Model 362 scanning potentiometerwas usedwith a Yokogawa Hokushin Electric 3025 X-Y recorder. All experiments were carried out at a controlled temperature of 20 1 C. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and constant potential electrolysis (CPE) were conducted in undivided cells with Pt electrodes in oxygen-free solutions under argon. The volume of solutions for CPE was always 35 ml. The anode for LSV and cyclic voltammetry (CV) was a Pt wire tip < 10-2 cm2, the anode for CPE was a,' Pt plate 3 x 2 cm. The reference electrode was Ag I Ag+ [ 0.1 M](AgBF4) in all experiments, and these were regularly checked against hydrogen electrodes. Actual values of anode potential when measured in CPE were 0.2-0.3 V above the corresponding values determined by LSV. The electrolyte in all solutions was Bu4NC104 0.1 M. Initial concentration of 2-methylnaphthalene 1 was 10-2 M. RuC13-3H20, when present, was 0.0025 M unless otherwise specified. Anhydrous RuC13 is insoluble and therefore ineffective. The solvent was acetonitrile-water 80120 v/v or 651 35 v/v. Deviations from any of the specifications listed above are indicated for individual cases. CPE for reactions with diisobutylamine (DIBA) and diisopr6pylamine (DIPA) was carried out in acetonitrile-water 65/35 in pH 7. All CPE were run and followed by sampling at 15, 30, 45 and 60 min. Aliquots of 0.25 ml were diluted with 0.8 ml methanol and analysed directly by HPLC. Analysis by HPLC was carried out on a Tracor 970A model, using a C18 inverse column with a variable band W detector which is selective for the naphthalene derivatives but insensitive to the electrolyte or the amines. Recording was done with a Merck-Hitachi D 2000 Chromato-Integrator with which the ratio of molar concentrations to HPLC peak areas was determined by calibration. Analysis was also by TLC, by GCMS and HPLCMS. Compounds 2 and 2,2'-dimethylbinaphthyl are the most commonly formed products. RuCls - 3H20 also shows a well-defined peak in HPLC by which its quantity during and after runs can be determined in comparison with 1 and 2. In control tests for background chemical reactions in the presence of RuC13-3H20, mixtures were kept for 2.5 h with no exerted potential, and yielded 2 up to 0.04% at 20 C and 0.2% at 50 C. Results The anodic oxidation of 1 has been studied by CPE in undivided cells and was followed up by voltammetric measurements. RUC13 - 3H20, Ru(acac)3 88 and RuC16(NH4)2 were tested as catalysts, and catalysis by RuC13 - 3H20 is the main objective of this study. Oxidative coupling of the initially formed radical-canon is observed in anhydrous as well as in aqueous acetonitrile (see below, Scheme 1), but 2 is formed only in aqueous solutions where water acts presumably as a hydroxylating agent [ 12 ] . A typical follow-up of CPE of 1 at 1.8 V is outlined in Fig. 1. Initial rates are calculated from the tangent to the reaction curve at time zero. Selectivity for 2, i.e. formation of 2 vs. consumption of 1, is calculated as 102 times the ratio of initial rates, i.e. 100X [d[2]/dt/d[1]/dt] as determined from HPLC readings.

The rates increase in all catalysed runs but increase in rate as well as in selectivity for 2 is brought about only in the presence of acid. The selectivity for 2 improves from 12.7 and 18ss'o to 17 and 22ss'o in reactions catalysed by RuC13 - 3H20 (sets 2 and 3). At 1.8 V for the working electrode, the direct (uncatalysed) electrolysis is ten times slower than at 2.2 V, while the catalysed reaction is only three times slower (compare Table 1 sets 3 and 4). The selectivity in these reactions attains 28-30ss'o. Below 1.8 V (CPE), in acetonitrile-water 65/35 there is practically no uncatalysed reaction (see Table 1 set 4). A sample run is given in Table 2, where the electrolysis carried out at 1.8 V in acetonitrile-water 80/20, without acid may be compared with set 1 in Table 1 (same .solvent) or set 4 (same potential). The ratio of rates of catalysed to uncatalysed oxidation is higher at 1.8 V than at 2.2 V (Fig. 1) and selectivity for 2 at this lower potential is in the range of 9% for the uncatalysed reaction and 27% for the catalysed run. It is also seen in Table 1 that increased amounts of RUC13 - 3H20 have a limited effect. The ruthenium salt is a recoverable catalyst, of which 90 t 590 is recovered after electrolysis of 1 h at 2.2 V and 95% after 1 h at 1.8 V in solutions of acetonitrile-water 65 /35 oracetonitrfle-water80/20, conditions under which 90% 1 is converted. A small amount of water is essential in order to obtain 2, but reactions slow down when the proportion of water becomes too high. The rate of direct oxidation in acetorutrile-water 65/35 is half that in acetonitrile-water 80/ 20. This corresponds to voltammetric measurements that show that overpotential for the oxidation of 1 increases with addition of water. A typical i-E curve of LSV in dry acetonitrile, with Bu4NC104 0.1 M, shows two maxima for the anodic oxidation of 1 at Ep 1.4 V and E, 2.0 (for v=50 mV s-1); 2.1 V (for v=500 mV s-1) anodic (Fig. 2), which converge to one distinct wave at E,p 1.7 V in the presence of water. The addition of RuC13-3H20 in dry acetonitrile has no effect on the first wave of 1, but the second LSV wave is enhanced and shifted to a potential lower by 0.12 V. It is also noted that whether Ru is present or not, the second wave becomes smaller relative to the first when scan rates are increased TABLE 2 CPE at 1.8 V with Pt anode, BuqNC10q, acetonitrile-water 80/20 ww, concentration of 1=10-2 M; A=RuC13 absent; B=RuC13 0.025 M.

In all cases the second wave disappears when water is added. The single wave observed in aqueous solutions is not affected by RuCla ~ 3H20. Cyclic Voltaxnmetry (CV) of RuC13 ~ 3H20 in dry a.cetorutrile gives a complex i E curve which may reflect formation of Ru02 on the electrode. A part showing an irreversible redox curve with EP an9dic at 1.3 V is shown in Fig. 3. The Voltammagram is unaffected by the presence of 1, but water concentrations as high as 4.5 M increase current densities. The same increase occurs when RuCl3 ~ 3H20 is added to acetorutrile/$u4NC104 0.1 M containing water. It is particularly pronounced around 1.8 V (Fig. 4), in accord with the previously reported observation of RuC13 having a low overpotential for the oxidation of water [ 11 j and observations that water causes a gradual current increase but no peak current. We have also examined the effect of Ru(acac)3 as a reversible [Ru3+ j electron-transfer standard (Table 3). The reactions occur at 2.2 V in acetonitrile-water 65/35. Yields of 2 are low and side products not analyzed here. Although both Ru(acac)3 and RuC13 ~ 3H2(J apparently act through oxidation of water (see below), Ru(acac)3 causes faster oxidation of 1 but does not improve the yields of 2 over uncatalysed reactions. The CV of Ru(acac)3 is well defined. Ru(acac)3 is a known one-electron standard [13], and in dry acetorutrile I Bu4NC104 0.1 M has a reversible CV curve (Fig. 5). 91 I IOyA (a) 5 4 3 50yA 2 I L (b) I 1,8 0 V V Fig. 4.

The current potential curve is not at all affected by 1, but small amounts of water increase the oxidation current at Ep > 1.09 V and decrease the return wave. Hence Ru(acac)3 exhibits characteristics expected of a true homogeneous mediator [ 14 ] for the oxidation of water, while no correspondence with the oxidation wave of 1 is detected. 92 Ru(NH4)ZCIe as a [Ru4+] salt seems to be more effective and have better selectivity for 2 than RuC13 - 31120, which provides some support to the contention that an active form of [Ru4+ ] may be involved. However we could not examine the correspondence of voltammetric curves of 1 and Ru(NH4)2C1g, due to the insolubility of the latter in dry acetonitrile. The construction of a catalyst with still lower E values was tested by adding electron-donating ligands to RuC13 - 31120. When tested by LSV at pH > 7 with 0.25 M DIBA, 1 shows an oxidation wave at E1,3 -1.08 which shifts to 0.93 V when RuC13 - 31120 is present as well (Fig. 6). Such an effect is also observed with DIPA but not with di-n-propylamine. No complex of RuC13 and DIBA or DIPA has been isolated, but > 70 fold excess amine causes disappearance of the UV absorption bands for RuC13 - 31120 at 585 and at 400 nm in acetonitrile-water 65 /35, implying a reversible association between the amine and ruthenium salt with a small equilibrium constant. This is not seen with di-n-propylamine. When CPE is carried out with excess DIBA or DIPA (Table 4), both consumption of 1 and formation of 2 are accelerated and the minimum required value of anode potential is only 1.2 V (Table 4). A comparison of control runs carried out at 1.8 V in acetonitrile-water 65/ 35 shows that addition of DIBA alone has a positive effect on CPE and accelerates the oxidation of 1 five-fold and formation of 2 1.1-fold. These effects are considerably stronger when RuC13 - 31120 is present (Table 4). In this case CPE in acetonitrile-water 80/20 is accelerated by a factor of 7, and CPE in acetonitrile-water 65/35 by 12 for conversion of 1 and by 22 I0.5 m< Fig. 6.

At 1.5 V the effect of DIBA is very significant, since in its absence even the reaction catalysed by ftuCl3 - 3H20 is negligible. The indirect electrooxidation of naphthalene to naphthoquinone-1,4 was also studied. The rate of reaction is close to the value obtained for 1. Little is known from this or from previous studies with regard to side products [10]. We have observed by GCMS and HPLCMS the presence of dimers, some methylnaphthol and a compound M/z 183, possibly C13H13N, a product of nucleophilic attack of acetonitrile on the radical-ion from 1. When CPE is conducted at 2.2 V, only a small increase in rates is observed for the catalysed reactions. The difference is more pronounced at lower potentials. Apparently at 2.2 V both indirect and direct oxidations take place, and the latter slows down at 1.8 V. The enhancement of initial rates, decrease in required potential and improvement in selectivity are important for flow systems where contact time is short. Lower potentials are also beneficial for work in undivided cells and for preservation of the electrodes. No optimization was undertaken but preferable conditions are 94 indicated. On the one hand low water content and low pH, on the other DIPA and DIBA combined with the catalyst in neutral conditions, are effective at very low potentials. The voltammetric analysis provides some elucidation of the reactions concerned. Discussion Oxidation of 1 to 2 involves many steps, the first being electrodic formation of the radical-cation of 1. In principle, in the first step E1, an effect of indirect electrolysis should be observed. Compounds such as W(CO)g and Fe(CO)6 act as mediators that enhance E 1 [ 12 ], but these do not necessarily augment formation of 2 since the radical-cation it not selective and may end up in oxidative coupling or other radical termination. Direct anodic oxidation of 1 ECE sequence in acid anhydrous solution: E1 C11H,o-e-' [CilHlol*+ (1) C1 [C11Hlol*+ -'' [C11Hsl*+H+ E2 [C11Hsl'-e ) [C11Ha]+ Nuclear hydroxylation and oxidation to quinone: C2 [C11Hlo] + or [C11Hs]* or [C11Hs]++H20-ss ---, CIIH802 (2) Oxidative cowling is more straightforward: C 2[C11H10] + `~ [C11Hlo-C11H10]2+ CzzH18+2H+ or C 2[C11Hs]' -' C22H18 E - Electrodic step; C =Chemical step; Scheme 1. The ECE sequence is suggested by the presence of two oxidation waves in the LSV curve for 1 in dry solvent (Fig. 2). The sequence E1-C1-E2 is a typical transformation expected for aromatic hydrocarbons [ 15 ]. Reaction of water with the product of E1 or C1 would quench step E2 and indeed LSV shows the quenching of the second wave by H20. The Randles-Sevcik equation [1, 14] which describes the i-E curve in terms of the diffusion current i, as a function of potential sweep rate v, shows that in CV of reversible electron transfer i, is linearly related to v -'10. In the present case, in anhydrous acetonitrile, the first wave displays an ip which grows by 3.2 when v is increased by 10 (Fig. 2) in accord with the Randles-Sevcik equation, while the second wave decreases at the same time. This can be explained 95 if the second wave represents a second oxidation stage of the primary product which is depleted as a result of the smaller charge passed under fast scan. RuC13 - 31120 differs from the carbonyls mentioned above, since it does not affect E1 but causes catalysed oxidation of water that could enhance hydroxylation. This fits the observations. Firstly, the anodic wave of RuC13 - 31120 in dry acetonitrile solution is not sensitive to 1, whereas a true mediator would be [4]. Secondly, as mentioned above, RUC13 - 31120 intensifies the oxidation current of water (Fig. 3). Although LSV shows a gradual current increase and no i is located, the reaction of ruthenium chloride with water rather than with 1 is apparently the initial step. This alone may not be sufficient, since by comparison Ru(acac)3 also catalyses the oxidation of water. Ru(acac)3 actually acts as a true homogeneous mediator for water oxidation at 1.09 V, yet it still does not promote formation of quinone. However, LSV in dry acetonitrile shows that a downward shift in potential of the second wave for oxidation of 1 is caused by addition of RuCl3 - 31120 (Fig. 2). Such a shift designates a lower value of AGO for this oxidation. Since the only change made to cause this shift was addition of RuC13 - 31120, this could result from some sort of binding of the ruthenium salt to the product of the first wave, presumably [C11Hlo]'+ or [C,1H9]'. Bringing the hydrocarbon and the catalyst into close contact at the site of water oxidation may be important in directing the reaction towards nuclear hydroxylation, and be the cause for difference from Ru(acac)3 which, unlike ruthenium chloride, is coordinatively saturated and does not affect the oxidation wave of 1. Clearly, LSV as in Fig. 2 shows that RuCl3 - 31120 actually binds to [C11H1o]\", the primary oxidation product (Scheme 2), to give an activated complex. It is only possible to observe this in the presence of minute quantities of water and in the absence of oxygen. Independently, the LSV results with amines such as DIBA similarly assert the crucial role of RuC13 - 31120 in the electron-transfer process from the shift of the single wave observed (Fig. 6), and especially confirm a way to manipulate the redox potential of the catalyst by complexation. The complexes of RuC13 - 61120 with aliphatic amines are apparently weak. In order for the UV absorption of unassociated RuC13 - 61120 to disappear completely, an excess of - 70-fold DIBA is required, implying a high dissociation constant. By comparison, absence of complexation with di-n-propyl amine corresponds to a zero shift of E, anodic in the i-E curve, i.e. with this amine there is no enhancement of electron transfer. With DIBA and DIPA, electron transfer is enhanced apparently through the formation of at least a transient associated complex of catalyst and substrate, since RuC13 - 61120-amine complex induces a shift in El, of ArH oxidation (Fig. 6), and an `inner sphere' mechanism [16] for the electron transfer is suggested. As for other differences between RuC13 - 31120 and Ru(acac)3, such as the presence of chloride ions, results were unchanged when the ionic strength of Cl- was increased up to three-fold with NaCl, with no evidence of chlorinated products. Voltammetric analysis reveals aspects of this catalysis which are not otherwise evident, but some of the chemical steps suggested in the Schemes 96 Indirect anodic oxidation of 1: E3 and C3 are clearly reversible for Ru(acac)3; RUC13 is not reversible: E3 Ru3+-e- [Ru4+] C3 [Ru4+]+1120--+ Ru3++H++[OH]' Since anodic hydroxylation is known [ 19 ]: [OH]'+CiiHlo-\"~ [CiiHio]'++OH- [OH]'+C11Hlo ) [C11HloOH]'+ Binding of oxidised hydrocarbon with RuClO112 O but not with Ru(acac)3 , implied by LSV: RuC13 - 31120+ [C11Hlo]'+ -- [(C11Hlo)(Ru)]4':+ A possible sequence brings hydrocarbon and hydroxylating agent into close contact which favours attack by electrogenerated OH' or OH-: C4 [OH]' or OH-+[(C11Hlo)(Ru)]4'+ -- -- C11Hs02+RuC13 (2) E = Electrodic step; C = Chemical step; Scheme 2. are not subject to it. Also, contributions of electrode surface or double-layer effects are not easily discerned. Thus DIPA in acetonitrile-water affects not only the redox potential of RuC13 - 31120 but the medium at large, since excessive amounts are used. In addition, the type of ruthenium ion in the active species cannot be accurately determined. Although at the end of a run HPLC shows no depletion in ruthenium chloride quantity, no information could be had from the CV analysis since [Ru4+], which presumably forms from RuC13 - 31120, is not reversibly reduced, at least on the voltammetry time scale. Indeed [Ru3+] is reported to be recovered only slowly from [Ru4+] [17]. If during electrooxidation a layer of Ru02, which is a strong oxidant [18], forms on the anode, coating of the electrode will require a negligible fraction of RuCl3 - 31120 and the rest will not be involved, which will explain its preservation. A Ru02 surface however should affect the first wave in dry solution. Repeated electrode performances also showed no bias. Still, this explanation should not be ruled out altogether. The reactivity of Ru(NH4)2C16 as a catalyst (Table 3) suggests that the Ru(IV) oxidation state is important, but it was not possible to test it by voltammetry in dry acetonitrile, in which it is insoluble. Illustrative and relevant aspects of indirect anodic oxidation by ruthenium compounds can be found in several other contexts [20]. Finally it is noted that the well-known electrosynthesis of benzoquinone from benzene is also based on iron-catalysed oxidation of water [21 ]. 97 Conclusion Formation of 2 from 1 requires several stages and is not directly related to the initial reaction of 1 or even to the oxidation of water, as is apparent from the difference between RuC13 - 3H20 and Ru(acac)3. The activity of RuC13 - 3H20 and Ru(acac)3 as catalysts is clearly not with 1 but with water, possibly to cause the electrogeneration of hydroxyl radicals and anions. In the case of RuC13 - 3H20, further interaction with the oxidized hydrocarbon is crucial for the formation of 2. At 2.2 V, 1 is oxidised both directly to the radical-cation and by the catalysed process which consists of a different chain of reactions. At 1.8 V the direct reaction is slow and the indirect process prevails, providing the increase in selectivity. The use of DIBA is another method of oxidation at very low potentials of the working electrode.

Michman ∗ Deparment of Organic Chemistry, The Institute of Chemistry, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 91904 Israel * Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. The indirect anodic oxidation of 2-methylnaphthalene and naphthalene to 2-methylnaphthoquinone-1,4 and naphthoquinone, respectively, was carried out with RuCl3·3H2O, Ru(acac)3 and Ru(NH4)2Cl6 as catalysts, in an undivided cell using platinum electrodes. Current-potential analysis of the hydrocarbon shows two oxidation waves in solutions of acetonitrile-H2SO4 which collapse into a single wave in presence of water, implying an electrodic-chemical-electrodic (ECE) reaction sequence. RuCl3·3H2O or Ru(NH4)2-Cl6 increases the selectivity for quinone formation, whereas Ru(acac)3 has no such effect. Voltammetry shows that RuCl3·3H2O and Ru(acac)3 oxidize water and not the hydrocarbon. It also identifies an activated complex in which RuCl3·3H2O, but not Ru(acac)3, binds to the oxidised form of the hydrocarbon. This analysis explains the catalytic effect of RuCl3·3H2O and the inefficiency of the coordinatively saturated Ru(acac)3. RuCl3·3H2O is also an efficient catalyst in non-acidic solutions containing high concentrations of diisobutylamine and diisopropylamine and in which oxidation of 2-methylnaphthalene to 2-methylnaphthoquinone-1,4 is possible at a very low potential.
