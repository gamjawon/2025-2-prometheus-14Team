Organic bases were first used as effective catalysts for the synthesis of propylene carbonate from propylene glycol and carbon dioxide in the presence of acetonitrile. Acetonitrile in the reaction acted as not only the solvent but also the dehydrating reagent to remove the water produced from the reaction. It was interesting that upon ammonium carbonate being introduced into the reaction system, the catalytic selectivity was significantly enhanced. With 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene (TBD) as the catalyst, the yield of propylene carbonate could reach 15.3% with the selectivity of 100% under the optimal conditions. Keywords Propylene carbonate Organic bases Propylene glycol Carbon dioxide Ammonium carbonate 1 Introduction Recently, due to that the development of an environmentally friendly industrial process utilizing CO2 has drawn much interest, it has been well recognized that the utilization of CO2 as a carbon resource is important [1,2]. The transformation of CO2 to useful compounds has been a challenge for synthetic chemists [3–5]. One of the most promising methodologies in this area has been the synthesis of five-membered cyclic carbonates from CO2 and cyclic oxide, such as propylene carbonate (PC) and ethylene carbonate (EC). Nowadays, numerous homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts have been reported to be effective in the production of five-membered cyclic carbonates [6–11]. Five-membered cyclic carbonates are commercially important compounds and are used as electrolytes in lithium batteries, as aprotic polar solvents, and as intermediates for producing polycarbonate and fine chemicals [12–14]. In addition to their biodegradability and high solvency, they have high boiling and flash points, low odor levels and evaporation rate and low toxicities. Moreover, a possible utilization of cyclic carbonates, such as PC and EC, is the transesterification with methanol to form dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and the corresponding glycol. It is well known that the transesterification of PC with methanol to form DMC is widely used in industrial synthetic process [15–19]. But, propylene glycol (PG) as by-product is always inevitable to be produced with DMC in the transesterification process (See Eq. (1)). How to effectively use PG was attracting more and more attention. At the present, the alcoholysis of urea with PG to synthesize PC is an available approach for making use of PG [20,21]. However, it is a more perfect route to directly synthesize PC from CO2 and PG (See Eq. (2)). In this way, not only can be PG recycled but also CO2 can be utilized effectively. As a result, DMC can be synthesized from methanol and CO2 by using PC as a recyclable intermediate according to Eq. (1) and Eq. (2). (1) (2) As a novel route, PC was first synthesized from PG and CO2 via CeO2–ZrO2 in the presence of CH3CN [22,23]. Although the selectivity of PC was 100%, the conversion of PG was very low, which was only about 2.0%. Recently, dibutyltin oxide or dibutyltin dimethoxide [24] has been developed to catalyze the synthesis of PC from PG and CO2 in supercritical conditions using N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as the solvent, but the yield of PC was still low. This was attributed to the thermodynamic limitation, and hence the removal of H2O from the reaction system will benefit the yield of PC [24]. In the present work, a series of organic bases, such as 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene (TBD), 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) and triethylamine (TEA), were used as catalysts for the synthesis of PC from PG and CO2 in the presence of acetonitrile. Different from the previous reports [22,23], CH3CN in the reaction acted as not only the solvent but also the dehydrating reagent to remove the water produced from the reaction. Thus, the thermodynamic limitation was shifted and the yield of PC was greatly improved. At the same time, ammonium carbonate was used as the coupling reagent to obviously enhance the selectivity of PC. 2 Experimental 2.1 Reagents TBD and DBU were produced by Fluka Chemie Company. TEA, ammonium carbonate, PG and acetonitrile were supplied by Shanghai Chemical Reagent Factory. All the chemicals were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. CO2 (>99.95%) was provided from Beijing Analytical Instrument Factory. 2.2 Reaction apparatus and operation The reaction was carried out in a 50mL stainless-steel autoclave reactor equipped with a magnetic stirrer, in which organic bases (2.5mmol) and ammonium carbonate (0.6g) were added to a solution of PG (7.6g, 100mmol) and CH3CN (10mL) as a typical process. And then CO2 was introduced into the autoclave to displace the air three times with the pressure of 1.5MPa. After that, the autoclave was pressurized with CO2, and then was heated and magnetically stirred constantly during the reaction. After the reaction, the autoclave was rapidly cooled to ambient temperature in a water bath and the excess of CO2 was vented slowly. The products in liquid phase were quantificationally analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC-920) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a capillary column (TC-WAX) using 2-propanol as an internal standard. And the qualitative analysis was further determined by GC–MS (HP G1800A) with a capillary column (HP-5MS). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalytic performance of organic bases in the presence of CH3CN The reaction results under various conditions are shown in Table 1 . Without the catalyst, the carboxylation of PG did not take place whether CH3CN was present or not (Entries 1 and 2 in Table 1). However, the considerable amounts of PC were obtained in the presence of organic bases (Entries 4, 5 and 6 in Table 1). The introduction of CH3CN appeared very important for the synthesis of PC from CO2 and PG via organic bases. In the absence of CH3CN, PC was hardly detected (Entry 3 in Table 1). In fact, many other reagents were also used as the solvent in our experiment, but they were found not available. The water produced from the reaction could be consumed via the hydrolysis of CH3CN, and then the yield of PC could be improved. As a result, CH3CN acted as not only the solvent but also the dehydrating reagent. TBD, DBU and TEA were strong non-ionic nitrogen bases and possessed considerable activities for the synthesis of PC from PG and CO2, producing 22.5%, 12.6% and 6.2% PC, respectively (Entries 4, 5 and 6 in Table 1). It was widely known that TBD was strong guanidine bases with Pka value of 25.9 (in CH3CN) [25] and DBU was strong amidine bases with Pka value of 24.3 (in CH3CN) [26]. TEA showed relatively weak basicity comparing to TBD and DBU, whose Pka value was 18.5 (in CH3CN) [27]. So, the yield of PC appeared to be dependent on the basicity, and the strong bases were favorable for the reaction due to their spontaneous ability for the hydrolysis of CH3CN. Among the catalysts, TBD exhibited the highest catalytic activity (Entries 4 and 8 in Table 1). As a result, the yield of PC over TBD was much higher than that reported by others [22–24]. Furthermore, with the amount of organic bases increased, the yield of PC was gradually enhanced and reached a certain value at last (Entries 8, 11 and 12 in Table 1). 3.2 Improvement of the selectivity of PC by ammonium carbonate Obviously, the selectivity of PC was not very high in the presence of CH3CN. PG–2-acetate was detected in a definite amount, which was attributed to that the hydrolysis of CH3CN formed acetic acid and ammonia (See Eq. (3)). Under the reaction conditions, so-produced acetic acid could react with PG to produce PG–2-acetate (See Eq. (4)). In order to enhance the selectivity of PC, ammonium carbonate as the coupling reagent was added into the reaction system. It was well known that ammonium carbonate was very easy to be decomposed to produce two molecules of NH3, a molecule of H2O and a molecule of CO2 (See Eq. (5)). Thus, the produced NH3 could inhibit the acetamide from further hydrolyzing to produce acetic acid, and then improved the selectivity of PC. As shown in Table 1, when ammonium carbonate was added into the reaction system, the selectivity of PC was greatly improved (Entries 7, 8, 9 and 10 in Table 1). (3) CH 3 CN → + H 2 O CH 3 CONH 2 → + H 2 O CH 3 COOH + NH 3 (4) (5) ( NH 4 ) 2 CO 3 → Δ CO 2 + 2 NH 3 + H 2 O The effect of the amounts of ammonium carbonate on the reaction is shown in Fig. 1 . With the increase in the amounts of ammonium carbonate, the selectivity of PC increased gradually or even reached 100%. However, the yield of PC was found to decline to a certain extent. This was due to that the NH3 produced from the decomposition of ammonium carbonate also prevented CH3CN from hydrolyzing, which resulted in the decrease in the yield of PC. As a result, the amounts of ammonium carbonate should be appropriate and more ammonium carbonate was disadvantageous to the reaction. 3.3 Effect of reaction conditions TBD was chosen as a typical catalyst to investigate the effect of the reaction conditions on the yield of PC. It has been mentioned above that the presence of CH3CN was very important for the reaction. Here, in order to further confirm the role of CH3CN, the effect of the amounts of CH3CN on the yield of PC was investigated in detail. As shown in Fig. 2 , the yield of PC remarkably increased with the rise of the CH3CN amounts from 2 to 10mL, and decreased by further increase in the CH3CN amounts. This could be ascribed to that CO2 was easily dissolved in CH3CN and CO2 concentration in the liquid increased with the amounts of CH3CN, which led to the high yield of PC. However, more CH3CN reduced the concentration of PG and then the yield of PC. As shown in Fig. 3 , the yield of PC increased with the rise of reaction temperature in the range of 75–175°C, but further increase of the temperature caused a sharp decrease in the yield of PC, possibly due to the formation of side-products, such as dipropylene glycols (DPGs), which was produced via the dehydration of PG [22,23], and the products of decomposition and polymerization of PC [24]. In fact, some other by-products were detected when the reaction temperature exceeded 200°C. Fig. 4 shows the effect of reaction pressure on PC synthesis. The yield of PC was nearly proportional to reaction pressure in the range of 2–10MPa. As mentioned above, CO2 could be dissolved in CH3CN, and the solubility of CO2 in CH3CN increased with CO2 pressure. As a result, the high concentrations of CO2 would shift the reaction equilibrium and improved the conversion of PG. However, the yield of PC did not further increase when reaction pressure surpassed 10MPa. The effect of reaction time on PC synthesis illustrated that the yield of PC increased with the reaction time (See Fig. 5 ). The reaction proceeded rapidly within first 15h, and then the yield of PC increased slightly, indicating that the reaction reached the thermodynamic balance. Furthermore, more by-products could be formed in this case [24]. 3.4 Possible reaction mechanism It was widely known that non-ionic nitrogen bases, such as TEA, DBU and TBD, possessed strong basicity, which were often used as nucleophilic reagents and proton acceptors to transfer proton from the reactants, and the proton transfer in acid–base catalysis is an important chemical step [28–30]. Especially, TBD as a powerful organic guanidine base, had been widely employed as catalysts in organic synthesis. In the present work, using TBD as the catalyst, a plausible catalytic cycle for PC synthesis from PG and CO2 has been proposed as illustrated in Scheme 1 . First, the complexes between TBD and PG were possibly produced in CH3CN, where hydrogen-bonded chains [N–H–O] were formed including TBD and PG molecules [31]. And the complexes were susceptible to react with CO2 to produce PC, and then the catalyst of TBD was regenerated. In addition, DBU and TEA were also possible to pass through the similar catalytic cycle. 4 Conclusions A novel reaction system was developed for the effective synthesis of PC via the reaction of PC with CO2 using organic bases as the catalysts in the presence of CH3CN. The yield of PC was found to be closely related with the basicity. In the course of reaction, CH3CN acted as not only the solvent but also the dehydrating reagent to eliminate water produced from the reaction, thus improving the yield of PC. Ammonium carbonate was added into the reaction as the coupling reagent to significantly elevate the selectivity of PC. Under the optimal conditions, the yield of PC could reach 15.3% with the selectivity of 100%. References [1] M.
