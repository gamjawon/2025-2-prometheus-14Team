It was found that in the presence of bisupported catalysts, the polymerization temperature and time affect not only the molecular weight, but also the polydispersity M ,/M . The kinetics curves of ethylene homopolymerization were decay type, but acceleration-type kinetics curves of ethylene- 1-butene copolymerization were obtained with the same catalysts. When AlEt2Cl was used as a co-catalyst the activity was very low, but there was a pronounced increase in activity when a mixture of AlEt3/AlEt2C1 was used as co-catalyst, and at an optimum AlEt3/AlEt2C1 ratio the activity was even higher than when only AlEt3 was used. The molecular weight (MW) and molecular weight distribution (MWD) of polyethylene (PE) with the (Si02/MgCl2)/TiC14-AlEt3 system were similar to those for the MgCl2/TiC14-AlEt, system, which indicates that the two catalyst systems have a similar active component. Under the same polymerization conditions, the activity for ethylene -1-butene copolymerization was much higher than that for ethylene homopolymerization. When the Mg content of the bisupported catalysts and the mole concentration of 1-butene co-monomer in the feed were increased, the activity of copolymerization and the content of 1-butene units in the copolymer increased, while the melting point, crystallinity and density of the polymer decreased. Results of 13C NMR and DSC analysis of the polymer show that the 1-butene units in the copolymer principally form isolated ethyl branches, and the polymer is nearly a random copolymer. Ethylene/1-butene copolymer with ultra low density can be obtained with these bisupported catalysts. Introduction Recently, new highly active bisupported catalysts for olefin polymerization have been developed and used in practical processes [1]. The main efforts seem to be directed toward modifying or developing catalytic systems that can produce polymers that have the desired properties [2]. We reported earlier [3] on the structure and behaviour of Si02/MgC12 bisupported titanium catalyst (SMT). It was found that the composition and structure of SMT catalysts have a remarkable effect on the activities of olefin polymerization. In this paper, the behaviour of ethylene homopolymerization and ethylene- 1-butene copolymerization with the SMT catalysts are described in detail. Copolymers with ultra low density from ethylene and 1-butene were produced by slurry copolymerization. 0304-5102/92/$5.00 1992 - Elsevier Sequoia. All rights reserved 196 Experimental Catalyst preparation All processes were carried out under inert atmosphere (NZ or Ar). To a reactor containing molten M9C12 alcoholate and equipped with a stirrer, pretreated Si02 (Silica 944 from USA, 200-300 mesh, calcined at 200 C for 4 h) was added to give a solid product. This solid product was treated with S'C14 in n-heptane at room temperature for 30 min, then at 60 for 1 h, then filtered and washed with n-heptane. The resulting solid was further treated twice with TiC14 in monochlorobenzene at 110 C for 1-2 h; in the first treatment, dibutyl phthalate (DBP) was added as an internal donor. The precipitate was separated by filtration, then washed with hexane and dried in vacuum to give the catalyst SMT. Polymerization and copolymerization Polymerization and copolymerization were carried out in a 500 ml glass flask equipped with a stirrer, in 100 ml of anhydrous n-heptane solution containing AlEt3 (TEA) and/or AlEt2Cl (DEAL) as co-catalyst at 60 C and at a pressure of 1.06 x 105 Pa. During the copolymerization the pressure was maintained by continuous introduction of a mixture of ethylene/1-butene of a given composition. Polymer characterization The molecular weight (MW) and molecular weight distribution (MWD) were determined by intrinsic viscosity measurements and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The intrinsic viscosity of the sample was determined using decalin as solvent at 135 C. The average molecular weight was calculated according to the following equations: [q] = 2.30 x 10-' M .82 [4a], and [q] = 6.77 x 10-4 M ;6' [4b]. The chromatograms were recorded on a Waters 150C GPC instrument, using polystyrene gel columns with porosities of 103, 104, 105 and 106, o-dichlorobenzene as the carrier solvent at 135 C, a solution concentration of 0.1-0.15% (w/v) and a flow rate of 1.0 cm' min-'. The melting point (Tm) of the polymer was determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), using a Perkin-Elmer DSC 7 instrument at heating rate of 20 C min-1. The crystallinity was calculated from the heat of fusion (dHf) using the following equation: crystallinity(%) = J Ho x 100 f where JHf is determined from the DSC curve, and dH is the heat of fusion of folded-chain polyolefin crystals, taken to be 66 cal g-1 [5]. The 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a JNM-FX100 instrument. The polymer solutions for the 13C NMR measurements were prepared in o-dichlorobenzene-d4. The 1-butene content and the triad sequence 197 distribution were calculated from the intensities of the signals according to the method reported by Hsieh and Randall [6]. The density of the polymer was measured with density gradient column techniques. A mixture of anhydrous ethanol and H20 was used to prepare the density gradient covering a density range of 0.82-0.95 g ml-1; the measurement temperature was 25.0 C. Results and discussion Ethylene homopolymerization In this section, we direct our attention mainly to the molecular weight (MW) and molecular weight distribution (MWD) of PE and the effect of aluminum alkyl on the behaviour of ethylene polymerization in the presence of SMT catalysts. MW and MWD of PE obtained with SMT catalysts It was found that, when the polymerization time (tP) was increased, the MW of PE also increased (Fig. 1). When the polymerization temperature (TP) was increased, the MW of PE decreased. The values of tP and TP affected not only the MW but also the polydispersity (MW/Mn); the results are listed in Table 1. With increasing tP, the value of MW/Mn increased, whereas the value of Mw/M decreased with an increase in TP. 5.0 50 C 4.0 3.0 0 x 3 2.0 60'C V 1.0 70 0 20 40 60 60 100 120 Polymerization time (min) Fig. 1.

As shown in Figs. 2, 3 and 4, GPC curves of PE obtained with the catalysts listed in Table 2 were all asymmetric, owing to several unresolved peaks. This may be attributed to the presence of several active sites on the catalyst with different reactivities.

For the Si02/TiCl4 catalyst, the GFC curve (Fig. 4) is rather broad and can be divided into three peaks with a polydispersity of 13.6, which suggests that there exist at least three types of active sites. It is known that there are three types of surface hydroxyl groups on Si02, which can react with TiC14 to form at least three types of sites, which are all active for ethylene polymerization. The active site for Si-O-Ti from single hydroxyl groups has the highest activity [7], so the position of the highest-molecular-weight peak corresponds to the polymer formed by this Si--O-Ti active site. The effect of aluminum alkyl on the behaviour of ethylene polymerization Aluminum alkyl co-catalysts have a great effect on the behaviour of ethylene polymerization (Table 3).

The effect of mixtures of TEA/DEAL on the activity was also observed. When TEA was used together with DEAC as the co-catalyst, there was a pronounced increase in activity, and at the optimum TEA/DEAC ratio, the activity was higher than with TEA only. Typical kinetics curves of the polymerization with different co-catalysts are shown in Fig. 6. In the case of DEAL as co-catalyst, the kinetics curve is `hybrid type' [8], while the other co-catalysts give decay-type curves. There is no difference in the rate of decay of polymerization when using TEA (curve (3)) and TEA/DEAC (curve (4)) as co-catalyst. This indicates that the enhancement of catalyst 201 TABLE 3 The effect of aluminum alkyl as co-catalyst on activities for ethylene polymerization a Co-catalyst Activity (g PE (g Ti)-' h-') AlEt3 4630 A1(iso-Bu)3 3488 AlEtZCl 499 AlEt3/AlEt2C1(mol/mol) 1/2 1230 1 4185 4 5784 8 4616 aPolymerization conditions: TP = 60 C, Al/Ti = 40, tP = 2 h; AlEt3 and AlEt2 Cl were added simultaneously. 4000 3000 _m O 4 m m 2000 3 o O N X 1000 O a- 0 7 0 4 0 60 60 100 1 20 Polymerization time (min) Fig. 5.

Further study is needed to confirm this. It is worth noting that the co-catalysts affect the morphology of the polymer particle to some extent. Figure 6 shows that, with TEA, the polymer particles obtained are spherical, but with DEAC, needle-shaped particles are produced. Fig. 6.

Ethylene-l-butene copolymerization Ethylene-l-butene copolymerizations were carried out in the presence of SMT catalysts with various Mg contents; TEA was used as co-catalyst. The results obtained are given in Table 4. It was found that the Mg content in bisupported catalysts has an obvious effect on the copolymerization behaviour. Increasing the Mg content results in increases in both the copolymerization activity and the content of butene units (B) in the copolymer, whereas the density of the copolymer decreases correspondingly. Under the same polymerization conditions, the activity of the catalyst is much higher in copolymerization than in ethylene homopolymerization. This may be explained by formation of new active centers due to the coordination of the co-monomer 1-butene to the initial active centers and/or by a decrease in the crystallinity of the forming polymer layer covering the catalyst particles [9]. The diffusion of the monomer to the growing polymer particle can proceed more easily if the crystallinity of the forming copolymer is decreased. The behaviour of ethylene-l-butene copolymerizations on changing the molar concentration of 1-butene co-monomer (cB) in the feed is shown TABLE 4 The effect of the Mg content of the catalyst on ethylene-l-butene copolymerization Mg content Homopolymerization Copolymerization B Copolymer density (wt.%) activity activity (mol%) (g cm-3) (g PE (g Ti)-' h-') (g PEB (g Ti)-' h-') 4.33 760 2302 5.34 0.9147 7.07 859 3676 5.61 0.9107 8.18 802 5031 7.72 0.8970 203 TABLE 5 The effect of c, on the copolymerization activity and properties of copolymers CB Activity B T Crystallinity Density (mol%) (g PEB (g Ti)-' h-') (mol%) ( C) (%) (g cm-3) 0.0 802 0 144.3 69.7 0.9406 5.0 2285 3.05 135.7 40.7 0.9280 10.0 5031 7.72 134.0 30.7 0.8970 15.0 6029 11.0 132.5 20.7 0.8915 in Table 5. With the increase in c,3, the activity of the copolymerization and the content of 1-butene units in the copolymer increased, while the melting point (Tm), crystallinity and density of the polymer decreased. Figure 7 shows the DSC curves of PE and copolymers of various compositions. The melting-point peak of the copolymer is broader than that of PE, which may be due to the heterogeneity caused by the incorporation of 1-butene. It should be noted that the values of the crystallinity and density are considerably low. Especially in comparison with a copolymer with a corresponding 1-butene content obtained using other MgC12 supported titanium catalysts [10], the Tm of the copolymer obtained using our catalysts is higher and both crystallinity and density are lower. Considering all the results listed in Tables 4 and 5, it can be concluded that ethylene/1-butene copolymers with ultra low density can be produced with these bisupported catalysts and that these copolymers show a broad range of densities. -4 i i ' 2 ' i I L ~ i i i i i 100 120 130 140 150 160 170 Temperature, C Fig. 7.

The triad sequence distributions, average sequence lengths and run numbers in the copolymers were calculated according to [6]. Typical results are given in Table 6, where [ B] and [ E] are the mole fractions of 1-butene and ethylene monomer units in the copolymers, respectively; [B] = [EBE] + [EBB] + [BBB] and [E] = [BEB] + [BEE] + [EEE]. The average co-monomer sequence lengths are given by nB = [ B] /1V and taE _ [ E] /1V; N' is the run number per 100 structural units and is equal to ([EBE] + [EBB]/2) x 100. With increasing mol% of 1-butene in the feed, the sequence distribution containing 1-butene units increased, while only the [EEE] sequence decreased. Although the values of nB slightly increased with increasing CB, the values of nB are close to 1. This suggests that the 1-butene units in the copolymer are nearly isolated. It was also found (Table 7) that, with increasing Mg content in the catalysts, the sequence distribution containing 1-butene units increased, while only the [EEE] sequence distribution decreased. This suggests that an increase in the Mg content enhances the reactivity of the 1-butene co-monomer. Kinetics curves of ethylene homopolymerization with effective SMT catalysts are decay type (Fig. 8). However, acceleration-type curves of ethylene- l-butene copolymerization are obtained in presence of the same SMT catalysts. Moreover, there is an acceleration period in the curves of the copolymerization, and this period varies with the molar concentration of the co-monomer 1-butene in the feed (Fig. 9) and the Mg content in the TABLE 6 Triad distributions, average sequence lengths and run numbers of copolymer obtained with various contents of the monomer feed (SMT cat.)

The higher the Mg content in the catalyst, the more potential active centers there are; and the higher the value of cB, the shorter the period necessary for the potential active center to transform into the new active center. It seems that these new active centers are rather stable, and for this reason, the rate is relatively constant after the acceleration period.

It was found that in the presence of bisupported catalysts, the polymerization temperature and time affect not only the molecular weight, but also the polydispersity M w/ M n. The kinetics curves of ethylene homopolymerization were decay type, but acceleration-type kinetics curves of ethylene—1-butene copolymerization were obtained with the same catalysts. When AlEt2Cl was used as a co-catalyst the activity was very low, but there was a pronounced increase in activity when a mixture of AlEt3/AlEt2Cl was used as co-catalyst, and at an optimum AlEt3/AlEt2Cl ratio the activity was even higher than when only AlEt3 was used. The molecular weight (MW) and molecular weight distribution (MWD) of polyethylene (PE) with the (SiO2/MgCl2)/TiCl4—AlEt3 system were similar to those for the MgCl2/TiCl4—AlEt3 system, which indicates that the two catalyst systems have a similar active component. Under the same polymerization conditions, the activity for ethylene—1-butene copolymerization was much higher than that for ethylene homopolymerization. When the Mg content of the bisupported catalysts and the mole concentration of 1-butene co-monomer in the feed were increased, the activity of copolymerization and the content of 1-butene units in the copolymer increased, while the melting point, crystallinity and density of the polymer decreased. Results of 13C NMR and DSC analysis of the polymer show that the 1-butene units in the copolymer principally form isolated ethyl branches, and the polymer is nearly a random copolymer. Ethylene/1-butene copolymer with ultra low density can be obtained with these bisupported catalysts.
