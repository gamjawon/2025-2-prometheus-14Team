Introduction Some molecular transformations at metal catalyst surfaces require single metal atoms as adsorption sites whereas others require sites each composed of an ensemble of metal atoms. Metal cluster compounds contain small numbers of metal atoms directly bonded together, and stabilized by ligands. It is important to know whether the metal clusters available as compounds (or derivatives of these clusters) have catalytic properties, and whether the available geometries simulate the ensemble sites at metal sur- \"''Present address: ICI New Science Group, P.O.

If such simulations are possible then the way is clear for the design and, hopefully, for the preparation, characterization and use, of an entirely new class of well-defined metal catalysts. We reviewed the field of clusters and cluster catalysis in 1981 [1] and have recently described the charac- terization of supported osmium catalysts derived from 083(00)13 and Osg(CO)i8 [2]. This paper rehearses the philosophy of our approach to the problem of cluster characterization. It might appear, at first sight, that cluster characterization should prop- erly be approached as an exercise in high-resolution electron microscopy. Certainly, single metal atoms on support surfaces can be rendered visible in electron microscopy by use of specialized equipment for systems composed of metals of high atomic weight and supports of low atomic weight [3]. Small clusters of metal atoms can thus be recognized by this technique. However, the average supported metal catalyst derived from a cluster com- pound has a constitution that does not readily lend itself to such high- resolution electron microscopy. In particular, the common oxide supports (e.g. silica and alumina), though they can be prepared in forms that are not opaque to electrons, nevertheless scatter the beam to an extent that makes it difficult under routine conditions to image metal clusters or particles less than 1 nm in diameter. The best result that we have achieved to date [4], using a JEOL 100C electron microscope, is the tentative recognition of Os^oC(CO)^~ clusters on single crystal MgO for which the osmium cluster diameter is nominally 0.7 nm, the longest non-bonding distance in the tetracapped octahedron being 0.567 nm. In such cases, where success is achieved, the cluster is imaged as a black spot on a lighter background. No structural information is available. Nevertheless, the result is valuable be- cause it shows whether or not cluster nuclearity is uniform, or whether a proportion of the clusters has sintered to give the microcrystals typical of conventional supported metal. For the materials described in this paper, the osmium clusters were of such a size that they were too small to be imaged by electron microscopy; from our experience with osmium and with these particular supports we conclude that the osmium clusters were less than 0.9 nm in diameter. Experimental Os6(CO)ig, which contains a bicapped tetrahedron of osmium atoms, was prepared by a literature method [5] and purified by HPLC. Purity was better than 99%, the impurity being Os^CO)^. Silica (Cab-0-Sil) and alumina (Degussa Aluminium Oxid C) were partially dehydroxylated by heating to 773 K for 16 h in a stream of dry nitrogen after which they exhibited BET surface areas of 110 and 97 m2 g~1 respectively. Supports were impregnated with solutions of Os6(CO)ig in 1,2-dichloroethane, and solvent removed at 313 K in a stream of dry nitrogen. The resulting materials contained 2.0% by weight osmium. 291 The instrumentation used to obtain optical spectra is described else- where [2]. EXAFS spectra were obtained at the Synchrotron Radiation Source (SRS) at the Science and Engineering Research Council Laboratory, Daresbury, Cheshire. Characterization Spectroscopic methods Freshly impregnated Os^COhg/silica and Os6(CO)i8/alumina possess no catalytic properties, but they are converted into catalysts, active at moderate temperatures [6], by a simple process of thermal activation involving heating in vacuum or in a helium stream at a steady rate of 10 C min~1 from 293 to 523 K. We have enquired, therefore, whether the clus- tered state is retained in the freshly impregnated materials and if so, wheth- er it is further retained in the thermally activated materials. At each stage, the alternatives to cluster retention are (i) cluster growth, and (ii) cluster degradation, ultimately to mononuclear species [7]. It appears to us that Spectroscopic methods must play an important role in investigations of the clustered state. Two techniques worthy of exploitation are UV/visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS). Each probes di- rectly properties of the sample which depend on the presence of metal atoms in the clustered state. UV/visible spectroscopy Tyier, Leverson and Gray have reported that Os3(CO)i2 in solution gives a UV/visible absorbance spectrum which contains (inter alia) bands at 330 and 385 nm which they assign to a - a* and a*'-> a* transitions, i.e. transitions involving orbitals associated with Os Os bonds [8]. Our spec- trum for Os3(CO)i2 dissolved in cyclohexane contained such bands at 329 and 394 nm. Osg(CO)i8 in cyclohexane provides comparable bands at 355 and 394 nm, whilst the higher cluster OSloC(CO)242- in ethanol gives bands at 341 and 387 nm. Thus UV/visible radiation can be used to stimulate elec- tronic transitions in the osmium cluster framework, and hence this spec- troscopy may be diagnostic for the presence of the clustered state in sup- ported materials including catalysts. Partial spectra for freshly impregnated Os6(CO)i8/silica and for Os6(CO)i8/alumina, and the catalysts derived from them by thermal acti- vation, are shown in Table 1. By analogy with the spectrum for Os3(CO)i2 in solution, transitions involving orbitals associated with Os Os bonds (region 1) occur in all of the supported materials, and hence metal-metal bonding is preserved throughout catalyst preparation. The spectra of Osg(CO)i8 and of OSloC(CO)242- in solution each con- tain bands in the region 425 - 900 nm, a region that is absolutely clear for Os3(CO)ia in solution. We call this 'region 2'. The freshly impregnated and 292 TABLE 1 Peak maxima over the spectral regions 300 - 420 nm and 550 - 650 nm in UV/visible absorbance and reflectance spectra Sample State of sample Peak maxima (nm) Region 1 Region 2 Os3(CO)i2 In solution8 329 394 Os6(CO)i8 Insolution8 355 394 596 OsioCtCO)^2\" In solution11 341 387 667 Os6(CO)i8/silica Freshly impregnated 328 370,413 606 Os6(CO)i8/alumina Freshly impregnated 342 427'1 595 Os,,(CO)i8/silica Thermally activated' 331 376,400 595 Os6(CO)ig/alumina Thermally activated\" 317 394 613 ^n cyelohexane. ''In ethanol. \"Active catalyst. dAssignment uncertain. thermally activated materials also showed bands in region 2, suggesting that not only is Os Os bonding preserved in the catalysts, but that high nucle- arity is also preserved. Partial data for region 2 are also given in Table 1. Full spectra for these and other materials have been reported elsewhere [2]. The advantages of UV/visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy are that it is simple to perform and it gives qualitative information about cluster retention quickly. However, the spectra are often weak, and arguments based on similarity of spectra are more convincing if corroborated by other inde- pendent observations. We have turned to EXAFS for independent evidence; this technique, by contrast, is far from simple but the same samples give acceptably strong spectra and the calculations are capable, in principle, of providing quantitative structural information. EXAFS spectroscopy Figure l(a) shows the osmium Lm-edge spectrum for freshly impreg- nated Os<,(CO)i2/silica after background subtraction, deglitching and spline smoothing. The contribution from scattering by the carbon and oxygen atoms of the CO ligands is small beyond an energy of about 400 eV and hence the observation of fine structure beyond this energy is evidence of scattering by osmium. In fact, this spectrum is closely similar to that for pure Os6(CO)ig for which a full analysis has been carried out resulting in calculated values for bond distances that agree closely with those determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction [9]. Thus, Figure l(a) demonstrates that Osg(CO)i8 is impregnated on to silica without either formula change or structural change. (Association with the support has not converted it to octahedral Os^CO^g2\" for which the spectrum is different in detail [9]). Figure l(b) shows the osmium Lni-edge spectrum for the catalyst obtained by the thermal activation of freshly impregnated Os<,(CO)i8/alu- mina. The spectrum is different from that shown in Fig. l(a), from which it 293 100 300 500 700 Photon energy /ev Fig. 1.

Nevertheless, fine structure at high energy reveals the retention of Os Os bonding and the Fourier transform of Fig. l(b) provides a value for the Os Os bond length of 0.280 nm (cf. 0.278 nm in pure OSfi(CO)is [9]) and indicates an average coordination number for nearest-neighbor osmium atoms of 4. It is hoped that further computation will provide non-bonding osmium-osmium distances and coordination numbers from which a structure for the cata- lytically active cluster can be determined. At this interim stage, the EXAFS spectroscopy supports and extends the information obtained from UV/visi- ble diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The EXAFS spectrum of a conventional 2% silica-supported polycrys- talline osmium catalyst (Figure l(c)) is quite different from that of the clusters, indicating no gross sintering during thermal activation. Infrared spectroscopy It might be expected that vibrational spectroscopy would reveal the presence of Os Os bonding, but our attempts to obtain such spectra for catalytically active materials have failed so far, possibly due to the low con- centration of the clusters on the supports. However, transmission infrared 294 absorption spectra give rich information in the carbonyl stretching region, and to a certain extent clusters of metal atoms can be recognized from the vibrational spectra of their ligands. Thus, Os^CO^g in a Nujol mull and freshly impregnated Ose(CO)i8/silica (values in parentheses) each provide 14 bands in the range 1935 - 2110 cm-1: 2109 (2110); 2082 (2087); 2061 (2060); 2042 (2044); 2034 (2034); 2023 (2023); 2000 (1999); 1995 (1995); 1987 (1985); 1984 (1984); 1977 (1977); 1972 (1972); 1944 (1945); 1937 (1938). Thus the impregnation of Os6(CO)ig onto the silica without molecu- lar change is confirmed. The same conclusion holds for impregnation onto alumina [2]. The infrared spectra of the thermally activated materials are different, and contain only three broad bands. For the material derived from Osg- (C0)i8/alumina the absorption bands are at 1945 cm\"1, 2021 cm-1 and 2120 cm-1. We have proposed that these bands represent CO bonded to osmium atoms in formal 1, 0 and +1 oxidation states respectively [2]. These formal oxidation states are present in the parent compound and appear to be retained in the catalytically active cluster. Catalytic activity in a series of these materials correlates with shifts in the band attributed to Os( 1) CO [6]. Composition and adsorption site density The characterization of a catalyst containing metal atom clusters involves determinations not only of nuclearity and of cluster structure but also the number and nature of the protecting ligands and the concentration of adsorption sites. During thermal activation of Os6(CO)ig/silica carbon dioxide is evolved, and the carbon loss amounts to 5% when expressed as the percentage of CO ligands converted to products. It appears that carbon dioxide was formed by the Boudouard reaction (eqn. 1)), 2(ligand-CO) = ligand-C + C02(g) (1) and chemisorption evidence for the formation of ligand-C is presented else- where [10]. Thermal activation of Osg( CO) is/alumina caused a carbon loss, similarly defined, of 15%, the products being CO;, 91%; C2H4, 7%; CzHg, 2%. The hydrogen atoms in the hydrocarbon originated in the surface hydroxyl groups of the support. Thus, the ligand-CO and ligand-C contents of the active catalysts are known. Adsorption site densities for these cluster catalysts can be determined from adsorption measurements using the conventional volumetric method [10]. Exposure of the thermally activated materials to carbon monoxide or to oxygen at 293 K results in strong adsorption irreversible at that tempera- ture. Desorption of each adsorbate can be achieved by heating to 523 K in vacuum, and such adsorption-desorption cycles can be repeated indefinitely. The amounts of CO and of 0; irreversibly adsorbed are closely similar; e.g. for adsorption on thermally activated Os^CO^g/alumina, the extents of irreversible adsorption were 13 ^mol CO (g sample)-! and 12.5 ^mol 0; 296 (g sample)\"1. Isotopic labelling experiments showed that adsorbed CO does not equilibrate with ligand-CO [10]. Thus, both CO and 0^ adsorption provide a measure of the adsorption site density. Consequently the empirical formulae of the catalytically active clusters can be expressed thus: for thermally activated Os6(CO)ig/silica, OSn(CO)2.sn- Co.inXo.osn; ior thermally activated Os^CO^s/alumina, Os,,(CO)2.2nCo.4n- Xo.25n> where X represents a site for the adsorption of one CO molecule or one 02 molecule (no assumption being made as to the nature of the adsorbed state or the number of osmium atoms that may constitute a site). Given reasonable values of n in the above empirical formulae, it appears that these osmium clusters possess only one or two adsorption sites each, on average. They are, nevertheless, good CO hydrogenation catalysts [6]. Conclusions This paper represents an interim report on the characterization of catalysts containing metal atom clusters. Elsewhere [2] we have speculated on the likely nuclearity of the catalytically active cluster, but the best hope for firm information lies in the further refinement of EXAFS spectra. One important matter not discussed here is the extent of the support- cluster interaction. That such interactions exist is manifest from support effects on catalytic activity and on the displacements which occur in the frequencies of the three bands observed in the transmission infrared spectra of the catalytically active materials [6]. Little is known of this interaction except that it appears to involve electron donation from the support to the cluster. A better understanding of the chemistry of this interaction must be an important objective of future characterization studies.
