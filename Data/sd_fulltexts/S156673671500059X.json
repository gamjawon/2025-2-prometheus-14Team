In this work, a catalyst with FeVO4 nanorods supported on TiO2 was prepared and applied for NH3–SCR reaction. A significantly enhanced low temperature catalytic activity has been achieved in the presence of 10% H2O with the active window shifting by 15°C to lower temperatures, compared to the classical catalyst with FeVO4 nanoparticles supported TiO2. For the catalyst containing FeVO4 nanorods, enhanced redox ability and enriched surface active oxygen species originated from its unique crystal structure and predominantly exposed reactive crystal facets (−2 1 0) on the catalyst surface are responsible for its improved low temperature catalytic activity. Graphical abstract Keywords FeVO4 nanorods Crystal planes NH3–SCR SO2 resistance 1 Introduction Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) with ammonia is considered as the most efficient technology for DeNOx process, the commercial V–W–Ti catalysts reveal considerably high NOx reduction efficiency under 300–400°C. However, due to several drawbacks associated with poor activity at low temperatures, formation of N2O at high temperatures (above 450°C) and the release of the poison vanadium pentoxide to the environment, the traditional V-based catalysts are deeply limited for further extensive application. Hence, considerable efforts have been devoted to develop an alternative with excellent catalytic performance and high resistance to SO2 and H2O poisoning [1–6]. FeVO4 is widely applied in high energy density lithium batteries [7], photocatalysts [8], catalytic hydrogen combustion [9]. Recently, M. Casanova and coworkers [10] firstly found that FeVO4/TiO2–WO3–SiO2 catalysts showed high catalytic activity in the NH3–SCR reaction at 250–450°C. Following their works another report by Liu et al. [11] also demonstrated that FeVO4/TiO2 catalysts showed excellent SCR activity and high N2 selectivity in a temperature range of 250–400°C. But a further understanding of the influence of the structural properties of the as-synthesized FeVO4 on the catalytic ability is not yet achieved in their studies. And further investigation of the FeVO4 species used as active materials in SCR reaction process is still absent. Generally, the catalytic performance of catalysts strongly depends on their crystal structures and surface active sites of their active components [12–14], owing to their direct relationship with the exposed crystal planes, redox performances, and stereochemistry of the as-prepared catalysts. A typical case is the iron catalysts used for the synthesis of ammonia. Another study by Zhou et al. [13] concluded that the conversion rate of CO oxidation over CeO2 nanorods with predominantly the reactive (1 1 0) and (1 0 0) planes exposed is three times higher than that over the traditional ceria nanoparticles with the (1 1 1) planes exposed at 190°C. To exploit a desirable catalyst with the defined crystal planes exposed many methods have been developed [15–17]. Among them morphology-controlled synthesis of nano-structured materials is an important route [13,15], due to the fact that the crystal planes are closely related with the morphologies [18,19]. The as-synthesized FeVO4 species prepared using the traditional methods usually show nanoparticle morphologies. To our best knowledge, FeVO4 nanorods supported on TiO2 used for SCR of NO with NH3 has not been reported so far. Considering that the synthesis of FeVO4 at normal temperature and pressure is rather sensitive to the preparation condition, mechanical mixing method was adopted to prepare the catalysts. Additionally, TiO2 was utilized as supporting material due to its high thermal stability, high surface area and excellent sulfur resistance. In the present study, two kinds of FeVO4 species, with nanorod and nanoparticle morphologies, were successfully synthesized at normal temperature and pressure but assisted by different surfactants. The relationship between the structures of FeVO4 and their catalytic performances was investigated. The reason of the improved low temperature catalytic activity over FeVO4 nanorods/TiO2 compared with that loaded with FeVO4 nanoparticles was proposed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation FeVO4 nanorods were synthesized by a co-precipitation method using Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and NH4VO3 as the starting precursors, together with PEG-200 as the structure directing agent. During the synthesis process the pH of the mixed-solution was adjusted to 4.5 by a standard NH3·H2O (3mol/L). The obtained deposits were aged for 7days at ambient temperature, then centrifuged and washed with deionized water, followed by drying at 100°C for 24h and calcining at 550°C for 3h in air, finally the solids were crushed and sieved to 40–60 meshes. The as-synthesized FeVO4 nanorods were denoted as NR–FeV. For comparison, FeVO4 nanoparticles were also synthesized using the similar method except that PVA-200 was used as the surfactant, which were denoted as NP–FeV. Pure Fe2O3 was obtained by direct thermal decomposition of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O at 400°C for 3h in air, and pure V2O5 was obtained by thermal decomposition of NH4VO3 at 350°C for 3h in air. The catalysts were prepared by coating the mixture of active materials and support TiO2 on honeycomb cordierites (cylinder, diameter: 11mm, length: 26mm, bulk: 2.5cm3, 62cell·cm−2, Corning Ltd. USA). Firstly, the as-synthesized FeVO4 materials support a certain amount of additive and water that were mixed and then ball-milled to obtain slurries with the solid content of 40wt.%. Then the resulting slurries were coated on cordierite substrates, and the excess slurry was blown away by air. Thereafter the catalysts were dried at 105°C for 24h and calcining at 550°C for 3h in air. The detailed description of the preparation of the monolith catalysts was already published in our previous study [20]. The contents of active materials in all catalysts were 12% by weight. And the total coating quantity was 160g/L. The two catalysts were referred to as NP–FeV–Ti and NR–FeV–Ti, respectively. 2.2 Catalytic activity tests The catalytic activity tests were carried out in a fixed-bed quartz flow reactor at atmospheric pressure with a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 30,000h−1. A movable K-type thermocouple is enclosed in the quartz sheath in contact with the middle pore of the cordierite substrates. The reaction conditions were controlled as follows: 1000ppm of NO, 1000ppm of NH3, 5% O2, 10% H2O, and 100ppm of SO2 (when used), balanced with N2, and the total flow rate was 1250ml/min. Prior to flowing the reaction gas into the reactor, all of the stainless steel piping was heated to 150°C in order to prevent the formation of ammonium nitrate and the condensation of moisture. The concentrations of inlet and outlet gas concentrations of NO, N2O, NO2 and NH3, were continually analyzed by a FT-IR (Antaris IGS-6700, Nicolet, Thermo Fisher Scientific). All the experimental data were recorded when the steady-state reaction was reached after 30min at each temperature. 2.3 Catalytic characterization The crystal phases of the samples were analyzed using a powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD: model D/max RA, Riga ku Co., Japan; Cu Kα radiation source, λ=0.15405nm). A scanning electron microscope (Hitachi-S-4800, Japan) and field emission high-resolution electron microscope (Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN, USA) were used to obtain surface information on the catalysts. The specific surface areas of the catalysts were determined by the N2 adsorption method at −196°C on an adsorption unit (Quantachrome, Autosorb SI, USA). The samples were pretreated at 300°C for 3h prior to the measurement. H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was performed using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Prior to the TPR measurements, the samples with a size of 40–60 mesh were treated under N2 at 400°C for 60min, which were subsequently reduced with a mixture (40ml/min) of 5% H2/N2 by heating at a rate of 8°C/min. The surface properties were determined on a British Kratos XSAM-800 electron spectrometer. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 XRD structure Fig. 1 illustrates the XRD patterns of NR–FeV and NP–FeV. The characteristic peaks at 25.2°, 27.1°, 27.8°, and 28.1° are attributed to the (0 1 2), (−2 0 1), (1–1 2), and (−2 1 0) lattice planes of the triclinic FeVO4 (PDF #71-1592), and no obvious characteristic peaks corresponding to V2O5 phase can be observed. Compared with NP–FeV, the relative intensity of (−2 1 0) peak over NR–FeV is obviously enhanced, indicative of a preferred growth of the (−2 1 0) planes. The XRD data of NR–FeV–Ti and NP–FeV–Ti feature only the typical anatase TiO2 (supporting information Fig. ST1), without observation of triclinic FeVO4, a similar result was also reported by Liu et al. [11]. 3.2 SEM/TEM and textural properties analysis Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of the two active materials. Obviously, NP–FeV (Fig. 2a) is composed of huge amounts of nanoparticles with an average size of ca. 95nm, while the sample NR–FeV (Fig. 2b) shows nanorod morphologies with an average diameter and length of ca. 73nm and ca. 453nm, respectively. Additionally, Fig. 2c and d show the TEM figures of the two catalysts, as we can see, the active materials in the two samples retained nanoparticle and nanorod morphologies respectively after coating, without changes of the shapes and sizes compared with those of NP–FeV and NR–FeV. It indicates that the coating process has little influence on the morphology of the active components. By further increasing the magnification, it can be observed that, NR–FeV–Ti predominantly exposes (−2 1 0) lattice planes (Fig. 2f), whereas in catalyst NP–FeV–Ti the crystal planes (0 1 2) are predominantly exposed (Fig. 2e), which is consistent with the XRD results. The BET surface areas of the two catalysts are listed in Table 1 , both of the two samples show similar textural properties, which makes it possible to compare the catalytic activities of the catalysts directly without normalization by the surface area. 3.3 Redox performance analysis It has been established that the redox ability over the catalysts containing vanadium species is considered as a key factor for the catalytic cycle of the SCR reaction [21,22]. The H2-TPR measurements are conducted and the results are shown in Fig. 3 . The support displays only one very weak H2 consumption peak at 520°C, assigned to the partial reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+ [23]. Four deconvoluted reduction peaks (α, β, γ, ν) are observed for the two catalysts. The reduction peak α (ca. 400°C) and β (ca. 450°C) can be interpreted as the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe(3−δ)+ and Fe(3−δ)+ to Fe2+ [24,25], respectively, the peak γ (ca. 510°C) can be attributed to the overlapped reduction of V5+ to V3+ [26,27] and Ti4+ to Ti3+, and the peak ν (ca. 590°C) can be assigned to the reduction of Fe2+ to Fe0 [24,25]. Clearly, the positions of peaks α and ν over the two samples are close to each other, but peaks β and γ over NR–FeV–Ti locate at significantly lower temperatures compared with those over NP–FeV–Ti, implying the superior redox ability of NR–FeV–Ti. What is more, the total H2 consumption (Table 1) of NR–FeV–Ti is higher than that of NP–FeV–Ti, suggesting that the former has more reducible oxygen and oxygen defects. Taking the HR-TEM results into consideration, a short conclusion can be drawn that the predominately exposed (−2 1 0) planes over NR–FeV–Ti favors the formation of the oxygen defects and consequently enhances the redox performance. 3.4 XPS analysis As shown in Fig. 4 , the concentration of chemical adsorbed oxygen (located at 530.9–531.9eV) over the sample NR–FeV–Ti is noticeably higher than that over NP–FeV–Ti. It means that more oxygen vacancies are induced over the NR–FeV–Ti catalyst, which is in accordance with the H2-TPR results. It is well-published that the chemical adsorbed oxygen is highly active in oxidation reactions (NO+O2 =NO2) due to its higher mobility, and a “fast SCR” reaction would occur, thus leading to a significant increase in low temperature SCR activity [28,29]. Our separate NO oxidation reaction experiment (Fig. ST2) also evidently indicates that the sample NR–FeV–Ti has a stronger NO oxidation ability compared with NP–FeV–Ti. 3.5 NH3–SCR activity The SCR activities of the serial catalysts and support as a function of temperature were performed in the presence of 10% H2O, as shown in Fig. 5a. Apparently, the pure support TiO2 shows a negligibly low activity. And the pure Fe2O3/TiO2 demonstrates relatively low NO conversion. Though the sample V2O5/TiO2 shows a good catalytic activity in the temperature range of 300–400°C, it suffers a significant deactivation at the temperature above 400°C due to a competing reaction of ammonia oxidation [30]. As expected, the catalysts loaded with FeVO4 reveal significantly improved catalytic activity. Comparing the NO conversions over the catalysts containing FeVO4, it can be observed that NR–FeV–Ti discloses a significantly higher low-temperature catalytic activity than NP–FeV–Ti, with the active window shifting by 15°C to lower temperatures. At 225°C, the NO conversion is 60% over NR–FeV–Ti and only 44% over NP–FeV–Ti. In addition, a slight decrease of the NO conversions at the temperature above 450°C can be due to the oxidation of NH3. It is important to note that the concentration of N2O at the temperature below 450°C is negligibly low (below 4ppm). In order to further confirm the practical applicability of this promising catalyst, the effect of SO2 on the activities over NR–FeV–Ti was evaluated. As shown in Fig. 5b, the co-presence of H2O and SO2 has almost no negative influence on the catalytic activity after a 25h of continuous test at 280°C, suggesting that the catalyst has excellent resistance ability to H2O and SO2 poisoning. The above results suggest that FeVO4 nanorods/TiO2 catalysts are suitable for SCR of NO with broad active temperature window. This catalytic activity behavior mentioned here can be well connected with the above characteristics. It is widely accepted that different crystal planes contain different surface energies, which have a direct relationship with the redox performance and catalytic activity due to a fact that they usually act as the surface active sites [13,14]. From the results of the XRD patterns and HRTEM observations, the two samples have the same phases but different crystal planes are predominantly exposed. In correlation with the H2-TPR and XPS results, the improved redox ability and richer surface active oxygen species over the catalyst NR–FeV–Ti should be relied on the surface exposed planes (−2 1 0). Hence, it can be reasonably accepted that the surface planes (−2 1 0) are more active for the NH3–SCR reaction with respect to planes (0 1 2). And the reactive crystal planes (−2 1 0) on the NR–FeV–Ti catalyst surface exert an important contribution to the improved physical–chemical properties and the enhancement of the low temperature catalytic activity. 4 Conclusion The low temperature catalytic activity over the FeVO4 nanorods/TiO2 monolith catalyst is significantly improved compared with that over the traditional FeVO4 nanoparticles/TiO2 catalyst. The enhanced catalytic ability can be attributed to the improved redox performances and richer surface active oxygen species, which are considered to benefit from the predominantly exposed reactive planes (−2 1 0).
