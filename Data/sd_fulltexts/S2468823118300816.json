National Institute of Technology Division of Catalysis and Chemical Processes Rio de Janeiro Brazil Graphical abstract Cyclohexene to adipic acid synthesis using heterogeneous polyoxometalate catalysts. Polyoxometalates prepared with W or Mo precursors, have been used together with H2O2 as homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts for the adipic acid synthesis from cyclohexene. In this context, the K3PMo12O40, Cs3PMo12O40, K3PW12O40 and Cs3PW12O40 heteropolysalts were synthesized and calcined at 600 °C, characterized by XRD, acid-base titration, Raman Spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, SEM-EDX and evaluated in the cyclohexene oxidation to adipic acid. The XRD and FT-IR analyzes showed that the polyoxometalates structures were stable even after calcination at 600 °C. The thermogravimetric results showed that the heteropolysalts present superior thermal resistance compared to heteropolyacids. However, the acidities of the heteropolysalts are lower than the heteropolyacids. The K3PW12O40 catalyst presented the best performance in the catalytic tests (77% yield in adipic acid) associated with its higher total acid sites density. The catalytic performance of this recycled catalyst was evaluated and the yield in adipic acid was maintained. Keywords Cyclohexene Adipic acid Polyoxometalate Heteropolysalts 1 Introduction Adipic acid, or hexanedioic acid, is an important industrial commodity. It is used as a starting raw material for polyamide 6.6, among other products. There are several commercial routes for adipic acid production, all of them based on petroleum-derived feedstocks (cyclohexane, cyclohexene, cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone). Currently, about 94% of the production processes are based on oxidation of cyclohexane. Nevertheless, the usual oxidizing agent (HNO3) promotes the formation of N2O, a major greenhouse gas [1–3]. Awareness of environmental issues has proven to be an effective driving force in the development of friendly processes and technologies in the chemical industry. Thus, many researchers have developed alternative processes. The use of H2O2 as an oxidizing agent has been extensively studied, replacing conventional oxidizing agents such as HNO3. The application of H2O2 in the production of adipic acid is directly related to the development of sustainable processes, its decomposition produces water as by-product. On the other hand, the transportation, storage and use of concentrations higher than 60% H2O2 are complicated for safety reasons [4–6]. Alternative routes of cyclohexene oxidation to adipic acid have been proposed, and high adipic acid yields were screened in some versatile catalytic systems. For instance, Sato et al. [4] demonstrated direct cyclohexene conversion to adipic acid by using Na2WO4·2H2O as homogeneous catalyst and H2O2 as oxidizing agent. The experiment was carried out in a round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar (1000 rpm) and a reflux condenser (atmospheric pressure) and maximum temperature at 90 °C for 8 h. The authors achieved 78% in adipic acid yield. However, heterogeneous catalysts have advantages over homogeneous ones. They are more easily separated from the final product and have the advantage of being able to generate higher quality products [7]. Hydrogen peroxide has high concentration of active oxygen to promote oxidation reactions. Catalysts based on polyoxometalates of tungsten and molybdenum have been used together with hydrogen peroxide in both homogeneous and heterogeneous reaction systems for the production of adipic acid. In addition to the use of H2O2, there are several advantages in the use of polyoxometalates in catalysis. For example, they are more cost-effective than the noble metals that are traditionally used in many catalytic reactions such as ruthenium, platinum and palladium among others [8–10]. Peroxomolybdates and peroxotungstates are efficient phase transfer catalysts, using H2O2 as the oxidant in epoxidation of olefins, cleavage of double bonds, or alcohols to ketones conversions under moderate conditions. Compared to most existing systems for CC bond cleavage, the heteropolyacids require no organic solvent addition [11,12]. Polyoxometalates, in particular heteropolyacids and their acidic salts of the Keggin type, are excellent acid catalysts. The Keggin structure is composed of a central tetrahedron (XO4, where X = P, Si, B) surrounded by 12 MO6 octahedrons (M = W or Mo) arranged in four groups of the type M3O13 [13,14]. Heteropolyacids are completely soluble in aqueous reaction medium. Furthermore, the number of accessible surface acidic sites is low in apolar systems where they are insoluble. However, heteropolyacids containing polyoxometallic anions ([PW12O40]3−,[PMo12O40]3−) and an ionic exchange of H+ by large cations (Cs+, K+, Rb+, NH4 +) can yield insoluble materials in aqueous medium [6,12]. Heteropolyacids and heteropolysalts are strong oxidants capable of promoting redox reactions involving more than one electron. In solution, the reduction is accompanied by protonation to maintain the charge of the polyanions. Once reduced, they can be reoxidized by molecular oxygen [12]. The acidity of the polyoxometalates is a result of the large size of these polyanions and their poor interaction with the protons, H+ in the case of heteropolyacids and K+ or Cs+ in the case of heteropolysalts [12,15]. Alcañis-Monge et al. [6] studied the oxidation of cyclohexene to adipic acid. The authors reported the use of homogeneous (HPMo, HPW) and heterogeneous catalysts (PFeMo, PCoMo, PNiMo, VPMo, (N(C3H7)4)3PMo12O40, (NH4)3PMo12O40, Cs3PMo12O40 and Cs3PW12O40) in the cyclohexene oxidation reaction to obtain adipic acid in mild conditions (batch reactor, 75 °C and autogenous pressure). They achieved 80% yield for adipic acid using hydrogen peroxide as the oxidizing agent and Cs3PMo12O40 as the catalyst, with acetic acid in the reaction medium. This organic acid was added in order to stabilize the hydrogen peroxide, reducing its rate of decomposition and it had a remarkable effect in the adipic acid yield. In fact, the reported adipic acid yield was less than 13% when acetic acid was absent. Maheswari et al. [16] also showed that acetic acid acts positively on epoxidation reactions. However, according to Shang et al. [31], the acid can act as a catalyst for the hydrolysis steps. In this case, the catalysis would include a homogeneous contribution. With these premises, the objective of the present work is to prepare, characterize and evaluate K3PW12O40, K3PMo12O40, Cs3PW12O40 and Cs3PMo12O40 catalysts in the oxidation of cyclohexene to adipic acid, without addition of organic or inorganic acids and using H2O2 as the oxidant agent, with emphasis on heterogeneous catalysis. 2 Experimental 2.1 Samples preparation The synthesis of the polyoxometalates was performed in two steps. The first step was the synthesis of the heteropolyacids (homogeneous catalysts), which are the protonated forms of the polyoxometalates. This synthesis was carried out by adding concentrated HCl to an aqueous solution containing the Na2HPO4 and Na2MO4 salts (where M is W or Mo) [17]. Subsequently, extraction was carried out with ethyl ether to produce the pure heteropolyacids (H3PW12O40 or H3PMo12O40). The heteropolyacids were subjected to a thermal treatment in a muffle at 200 °C (rate of 10 °C min−1) under atmospheric air for 3 h and named as HPW and HPMo. Heteropolysalts (heterogeneous catalysts) were prepared by ion exchange of HPMo and HPW with K+ and Cs+ cations (K2CO3 and Cs2CO3) following the methodology reported by Okuhara et al. [18]. Addition of the stoichiometric amounts of Cs2CO3 and K2CO3 salts, required for the complete substitution of the H+ ions, was performed at room temperature and constant stirring. The catalysts were calcined in a muffle under atmospheric air at 600 °C (rate of 10 °C min−1). The samples were denoted as KPW (K3PW12O40), CsPW (Cs3PW12O40), KPMo (K3PMo12O40) and CsPMo (Cs3PMo12O40). 2.2 Catalysts characterization The heteropolyacids and the heteropolysalts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyzes performed on a Bruker D8 diffractometer, radiation Cu Kα, ranging from 5° to 60°. The composition of the samples was performed on an FEI Inspect S50 scanning electron microscope (20 kV acceleration voltage and secondary electron detection mode) and tungsten filament equipped with X-ray dispersive energy (EDX) spectroscopy detector. The analyzes were performed in triplicate in different regions. The primary structure of Keggin ions was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), using pellets containing 3% of KBr and the catalysts. The spectra were collected in a Thermo Nicolet iS50 spectrometer, in the region of 4000–400 cm−1 and resolution of 4 cm−1. Raman scattering spectroscopy was performed on a Horiba LabRam HR-UV 800/Jobin-Yvon equipment, equipped with a He-Ne laser (λ = 632 nm) with 10 mW of intensity, a CCD detector and an Olympus BX41 microscope with a 100× objective. Thermogravimetric (TGA) measurements were performed on a TA Instruments with simultaneous thermal analyzer SDT Q600. The analyzes were performed under air flow (50 mL min−1) and rate of 20 °C min−1 up to 900 °C. The acidity was obtained by acid-base titration in aqueous medium following the procedure adapted from Davis et al. [19]. This method is performed indirectly by placing a suitably standardized NaOH (0.01 mol L−1) solution on the solid catalyst maintained in contact for 10 min. In sequence, this solution was titrated with HCl standardized solution (0.01 mol L−1) until complete neutralization. The total density of acid sites was obtained by the difference between the initial NaOH mols added and the HCl mols used in the titration, with an error <5%. 2.3 Adipic acid synthesis The oxidation of cyclohexene to adipic acid was carried out in a batch reactor at 75 °C. The reaction medium composition was as follows: 9.5% m/m (catalyst/cyclohexene), 0.21 mol of H2O2 (5 mL) and 0.023 mol (1.2 mL) of acetonitrile. Acetonitrile was used for promoting higher stability to the heteropolysalt [6]. The quantification of the products from cyclohexene oxidation was performed by taking a liquid sample after 24 h of reaction, filtering and analyzing it in a Agilent 7890 A gas chromatograph (HP-5MS column, 30 m × 0.25 mm). The apparatus is equipped with an automatic injector, a flame ionization detector and a mass spectrometer for quantification and identification of the products, respectively. Conversion of cyclohexene, selectivity and yield to adipic acid was calculated according to the following expressions: Conversion = (mols cyclohexene reacted/mols cyclohexene initial) × 100 Selectivity = (mols desired product/sum mols products) × 100 Yield = (mols desired product/mols cyclohexene initial) × 100 Additional catalytic tests were performed owing to evaluate the reuse of the catalysts. After the first test with KPW, the catalyst underwent a regeneration treatment as follows: Sample 1 (KPW) – Treatment 1 – The catalyst was washed and centrifuged twice with distilled water and dried in an oven at 100 °C. Notation: KPW – Regenerated 1. Sample 2 (KPW) – Treatment 2 – The catalyst was washed and centrifuged twice with distilled water, dried in an oven at 100 °C and calcined in a muffle under atmospheric air at 600 °C for 3 h. Notation: KPW – Regenerated 2. The operating conditions and amounts of catalyst and reagents were identical to the initial catalytic test. 3 Results and discussion The thermogravimetric analysis of the Mo and W heteropolysalts are presented on Figs. 1 and 2 , respectively. For comparison, their respective heteropolyacids profiles are also presented on these figures. All the heteropolysalts were thermally more stable compared to their heteropolyacid precursors. These results are also observed in the literature [20–22]. Haber et al. [21] synthesized the heteropolysalts KxH3-xPW12O40 and AgxH3-xPW12O40, where 0 ≤ x < 3. According to the authors, KxH3-xPW12O40 form a solid solution for 2 ≤ x < 3 and AgxH3-xPW12O40 in the whole composition range 0 < x < 3. In these conditions, the heteropolysalts are thermally more stable than their heteropolyacid precursors, and decomposes only at temperatures above 900 °C. Based on Figs. 1 and 2, tungsten heteropolysalts presented higher thermal resistance than the heteropolysalts of Mo as observed by Kozhenikov [12]. The thermal stability of the catalysts follows the order: Heteropolysalts > HPW > HPMo. For heteropolyacids, the major weight loss occurred before 200 °C. These weight losses are related to the elimination of water molecules at lower temperatures, attributed to crystallization water (up to 200 °C) and constitutional water (up to 400 °C). There is still an abrupt weight loss around 750 °C, especially for HPMo and its salts, that was attributed to the decomposition of the catalysts, promoting phases segregation. It is important to highlight the high thermal stability of HPW and its salts, even at 900 °C. The primary structure of tungsten and molybdenum polyoxometalates were evaluated by FT-IR and these results are presented in Fig. 3 a and b, respectively. The typical Keggin anion bands of tungsten and molybdenum polyoxometalates are the PO4 central tetrahedron bands at 1080/1070 cm−1, W = O/Mo = O at 982/965 cm−1, WOW/MoOMo edge sharing at 815/790 cm−1, WOW/MoOMo corner sharing at 891/870 cm−1 and OPO at 588/591 cm−1 [22–25]. The splitting observed at 982/965 cm−1 can be associated to the interaction between Cs+/K+ and W = O/Mo = O The displacement in the characteristic frequencies of MOM edge (M = W or Mo) may be assigned to the interaction between Keggin anion and cation (Cs+ or K+) [26]. The results obtained by FT-IR spectra in the present work were in agreement with those found in the literature, which proves that the synthesis method was efficient. Furthermore, all bands observed for the polyoxometalates, after ion exchange, indicate that the Keggin primary structure remains intact. The diffractograms of the stoichiometric salts and the heteropolyacids are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 . The XRD of HPW, CsPW and KPW show no evidence of phase segregation and are in agreement with the literature [21]. The XRD of the catalyst HPMo shows the characteristic phases of heteropolyacid besides reflections related to α-MoO3. It was also reported by Abu-Zied et al. [27] and maybe due to the high calcination temperature. KPMo also shows extra reflection peaks. CsPMo was the only one that presented a single phase (only the peaks corresponding to the cesium salt) as also observed by Langpape et al. [20] and Abu-Zied et al. [27]. The displacement of the peaks of the heteropolysalts can be related to the cations insertion in the heteropolyacid structure [27,28]. According to Corma et al. [28], the insertion of cations causes a rearrangement of the secondary structure of the polyoxometalates. These results also showed that Keggin's primary structure remains intact even after calcination at 600 °C. The chemical composition and acid-base titration results are presented in Table 1 . The compositions estimated by EDX, although limited to the surface of the catalyst, were quite close to those of the theoretical values, what means that probably the ion exchange between the Cs+ and K+ cations and the protons of the heteropolyacids was performed completely. However, the complete ion exchange of the cations reduced drastically the acidity of the heteropolysalts in relation to the heteropolyacids. Based on the acid-base titration technique used it is not possible to evaluate the strength of the acid sites. However, it is possible to measure the total density of these sites. The acidic properties of the heteropolyacids are related to the presence of protons. However, the drop in the density of total sites of the heteropolysalts can be attributed not only by the insertion of the cations (Cs+ and K+) but also to the calcination temperature used [29]. The total density of acid sites is consistent with the results found in the literature: HPW >> KPW > CsPW and HPMo >> KPMo > CsPMo [14,15,30]. Catalytic tests were performed using the heteropolyacids under the same conditions as the heteropolysalts tests and the results are presented in Table 1 in parenthesis. The homogeneous heteropolyacids catalysts have highest acidity and exhibited superior catalytic activity than their respective heteropolysalts, as observed by Essayem et al. [32]. The catalytic performances of the heteropolysalts in the cyclohexene conversion are presented in Fig. 6 . The yields were expressed in three distinct groups: Diol (cis and trans – 1, 2-cyclohexanediol), adipic acid (AA) and others (cyclohexene oxide, 1, 2-cyclohexanedione, cyclohexanone-2-hydroxy, hexanedial and hexanedioic acid-6-hydroxide). All catalysts achieved complete conversion of cyclohexene after 24 h of reaction. The four heteropolysalts showed selectivity to adipic acid, with a superior performance of the KPW catalyst that presented the highest yield of adipic acid. However, the recovery of this catalyst was only 74% (w/w) in relation to the initial amount used, indicating that part of the catalyst was probably lost during transfers, sampling or solubilized after 24 h of reaction, despite calcination at 600 °C. The same problem was observed by Alcañis-Monge et al. [6], where 40% (w/w) of the best catalyst was solubilized after three reaction cycles (total of 18 h of reaction). The synthesis of adipic acid involves basically two types of reactions: oxidation and hydrolysis reactions and both are favored by the presence of H2O2. The acidity is crucial for the direct oxidation of cyclohexene to adipic acid, and the addition of organic or inorganic acids enhances the stability and the oxidative properties of hydrogen peroxide. Moreover, the organic or inorganic acid can act as a catalyst for the hydrolysis steps in the reaction mechanism [31], that is, the system has a homogeneous catalysis contribution. Thus, in this work, acetic acid was not used in order to ensure that the exclusive effect of heteropolysalts as catalysts is being evaluated. As aforementioned, the yield of adipic acid seems to be correlated with the catalyst acidity. However, the decomposition of H2O2 (evaluated by the pressure achieved inside the reactor, Table 1), also shows a positive influence, as observed by Shang et al. [33]. In agreement to this, the best catalyst in this work, KPW, presented the highest pressure (77 psi) and the higher concentration of acid sites (Table 1). Besides, a reaction was carried out without catalyst (heteropolyacids or heteropolysalts). In this case, the pressure reached 34 psi but no adipic acid was formed. Thus, our results show that the catalysts are acting on both the decomposition of H2O2 and the oxidation of the diol to adipic acid. Among the synthesized samples, the acidity of the catalysts was higher using potassium than cesium salts, since the formers tend to be less basic than the cesium salts. As we can observe in Fig. 7 , the catalytic activity increases with the increase of acidity. This parameter seems to be important for the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The FT-IR analysis of the polyoxometalates in the region above 1200 cm−1 is showed in Fig. 8 and indicates the presence of hydroxonium ion or di-aqua proton (H5O2 + = H2O⋯H+⋯OH2), in the range of 1610–1620 cm−1 and in approximately 3500 cm−1 [34,35]. Among the heteropolysalts, KPW is the only that presents these bands, reinforcing that KPW is more acid than the other heteropolysalts. Considering that the recyclability of the catalyst is an important parameter for its potential application, recycling tests of KPW were conducted under the same reaction conditions. The potassium heteropolysalt was recovered by two different treatments and the samples were denoted as KPW – Regenerated 1 and KPW – Regenerated 2, with similar mass recovery of 74% and 70% (w/w), respectively. The yields of the products after the catalyst regeneration are shown in Fig. 9 . Both tests performed with the regenerated catalysts achieved 100% conversion of cyclohexene. However, the first recycle with KPW – Regenerated 1 showed a lower yield in adipic acid (23%), much lower than the catalytic test with fresh KPW that reached 77% yield. On the other hand, the reuse of the catalyst KPW – Regenerated 2 presented almost the same adipic acid yield than the initial test (81%). The acidity of the catalyst was measured again after the first catalytic test and second calcination in muffle (600 °C for 3 h). The results showed a small drop compared to the original catalyst, but not enough to decrease its yield in adipic acid, as we can see in Fig. 7. This small decline may be attributed to the high temperature of the second calcination that may have removed the hydroxonium ion from the heteropolysalt structure. The thermogravimetric curves of the regenerated catalysts are showed in Fig. 10 . KPW Regenerated – 1 shows mass loss up to 200 °C (H2O loss) and at higher temperatures (>450 °C) that may be related to the decomposition of organic reaction products not removed by the thermal treatment at 100 °C (regeneration procedure 1). This low temperature may not have been sufficient to eliminate all organic material deposited on its surface. This blockage by the organic material may have prevented the access to the catalyst acid sites that promote the oxidation and hydrolysis reactions. On the other hand, KPW – Regenerated 2 presented the same profile as the fresh KPW catalyst. In order to analyze the effect of the thermal treatment on the structure of the catalysts, Raman spectroscopy analyzes of KPW and KPW – Regenerated 2 were performed and the results are presented in Fig. 11 . The Keggin anion characteristic bands at 1011 cm−1, which refer to the symmetrical stretch WO of the terminal groups, are present in both heteropolyacids and heteropolysalts. The small differences can be explained by the insertion of the large monovalent cation, into the heteropolyacid structure. An expansion occurs in its structure, as reported by other authors [20,28]. However its rupture does not occur, remaining intact, showing a great thermal stability, even after a second calcination of the catalyst KPW – Regenerated 2, also performed at 600 °C for 3 h. In addition, we can verify bands related to WOW vibrations at 217 cm−1, 522 cm−1, 536 cm−1. Thus, we conclude that there is preservation of Keggin's primary structure. 4 Conclusions The heteropolysalts catalysts syntheses were successfully performed. All heteropolysalts presented higher thermal stability than their heteropolyacids precursors and were active in the oxidation of cyclohexene to adipic acid. The ion exchange resulted in catalysts with different acid properties, ascribed to the basic strength of K+ and Cs+ cations. Among the heteropolysalts, KPMo and KPW catalysts showed higher acidity, H2O2 decomposition and yields of adipic acid. A direct relationship between the acidity of the catalyst with catalytic activity and selectivity in the oxidation of cyclohexene to AA was observed. The characterizations showed the insertion of Cs+ and K+ in the heteropolyacid structure. The calcination at 600 °C did not cause the collapse of the primary structure of the heteropolyacid. All catalysts were active and selective to adipic acid, even with a complete absence of organic or inorganic acid as proton promoters. The regeneration of the catalyst showed that KPW is highly thermo resistant, as it was able to maintain the primary structure characteristic of the Keggin anion even after a second calcination at 600 °C. In addition, its acidity suffered a slight drop after the second calcination. However, the conversion remained at 100% and the adipic acid yield practically maintained unchanged.
