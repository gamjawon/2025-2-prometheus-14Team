Graphical abstract The devastative effects of traditional fossil fuel consumption have made biomass (e.g., plants, wood, and waste) a widely used renewable source of energy. The variety in biomass properties makes tunable catalysts an essential ingredient to promote reactions for desired molecule outputs. Catalysts with optimal catalytic performance are typically structured with complicated morphology, such as high porosity and sophistic pore network, which makes it challenging for catalyst fabrication. Recent progress in utilizing 3D printing as the fabrication method has demonstrated great potential of handling the complex structure while improving catalytic performance; however, rare work has focused on biomass-bio-oil conversion (BBC). With the aim of developing the optimal structured catalysts for BBC applications, this paper particularly reviewed 1) typical catalysts used for biomass conversion applications, 2) 3D printed catalysts, and 3) design and optimization of structured catalysts. It is found that the BBC is often isolated from manufacturing and focused more on different catalyst composition with transition metals to provide the desired catalyst architecture and further to improve upgrading of the BBC product. Current work on 3D-printed catalysts also show deficiency in several aspects including formation of coke and catalyst deactivation, lack of a comprehensive design for the catalyst structure (e.g., mostly 2D structures), absence of manufacturing constraints in design operation, and insufficient resolution of 3D printing methods. To solve these issues, several potential research directions and opportunities are discussed at the end of the study. Keywords Biomass conversion Catalyst morphology 3D printing Catalyst design Optimization Data availability No data was used for the research described in the article. 1 Introduction As the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere rises, biomass has become a viable non-greenhouse energy source. Biofuel that is created from biomass recycles atmospheric carbon, as opposed to fossilised carbon conversion, which only creates carbon dioxide. However, biomass conversion still has many limitations. For example, bio-oil, one product of biomass conversion using fast pyrolysis (a thermochemical process with controlled environment), is highly corrosive and has a low heating value since it comprises a complicated variety of oxygen functional groups [1]. Moreover, bio-oil has high viscosity and is not chemically stable when stored, which is due to a number of processes, such as polymerization, that occur between the various oxygenation functionalities [2].To improve bio-oil yield and quality, a catalyst is frequently used in the process. Some of the instances include zeolite, activated carbon, alumina, etc., each of which has different impacts on the product yields and imposes various challenges. For example, catalyst deactivation was observed during the process using ZSM-5 as one of the popular catalysts in this application, since the micro-porous architecture of these catalysts are clogged by solid residue (coke). Some studies tried to alleviate the problem by employing dopants into the catalyst [3,4], however the recent investigations suggest using hierarchical catalyst [5]. The inquiries into both approaches require a general understanding of the catalyst morphology and a proper design structure. Since the overall objective is to improve the reaction rate and product selectivity, adding catalyst to the reaction is essential along with the tuning of other parameters, such as concentration of the reactants, surface area and temperature [6]. A catalyst can lower the activation energy for a reaction by i) aligning the reacting particles to increase the likelihood of a successful collision, and ii) reacting with the reactants to create an intermediate that requires less energy to complete the reaction [7]. A proper design of the catalyst architecture can significantly promote the reaction rate [8]. However, understanding of the catalyst morphology and the impact of morphological parameters on the reaction rate during the thermochemical processes has rarely been discussed in the literature. Furthermore, due to the high geometrical complexity of the optimal design, the manufacturing constraints need to be considered which is also neglected in previous studies. A proper manufacturing technique is critical for securing the desired performance of a structured catalyst with complicated structures. The recent advancements in additive manufacturing (AM, also known as 3D printing) made this technology a great candidate for this application. AM is an advanced fabrication process in which precise geometric patterns can be manufactured by deposition of materials layer by layer. The ability to locally tune catalyst morphology along both the axial and transversal coordinates and control the material compositions has brought unprecedented design freedoms for optimizing the catalyst patterns. There have been a variety of studies focused on the 3D fabrication of catalysts for different applications including monolithic catalysts, reactors, mixers, and ancillaries [9], yet the investigation into the biomass application is scarce. The mostly used 3D printing techniques for catalytic materials in literature are composed of slurry-based [10], filament-based [11] and powder-based [12] methods. The process of choosing the right approach while taking into account the porosity, resolution, and compatible materials may actually open up opportunities for an infinite number of possible geometries. Despite the recent advancements, there are still many fabrication challenges, such as material limitations, printing quality, and resolution of printers for nano-scale porous media. With the aim of developing novel structured catalysts for biomass-bio-oil conversion with improved catalytic performance, this paper has reviewed the progress in 3D printing and optimal design of catalysts. This literature review begins by outlining the catalysts that are most frequently used in biomass conversion processes and then examines various measures that have been taken to enhance the quality of the bio-oil. Next, key 3D printing techniques for catalyst fabrication are summarized. Furthermore, the significance of catalyst morphology and how the morphology affects the overall catalytic performance are surveyed. More specifically, the design and optimization of the catalyst structure regarding the design variables and objective functions are presented. Finally, potential research directions to tackle the identified challenges are discussed. 2 Biomass conversion A variety of thermochemical techniques have been used to make bio-oil. Pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction are the most common ones [13]. These methods transform biomass feedstock to bio-oil, biochar, and gas, the compound of which may vary and depend on the feedstock, pre-treatment, process, operating conditions, and subsequent upgrading. Table 1 [14] compares the characteristics and technical practicability of the two thermochemical operations for bio-oil generation. Fast pyrolysis is characterised by a short residence time (1 s), atmospheric air pressure, and a moderate temperature (450–500 °C). However, biomass drying is required. In contrast, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) requires a lower temperature (300–400 °C), longer residence durations (0.2–1.0 h), and higher working pressure (5–20 MPa). In addition, the HTL process does not need drying of the feedstock, making it particularly ideal for naturally wet biomass. However, a catalyst is frequently used in this process to improve oil yield and quality. As seen in Table 1, the fast pyrolysis process would have a higher bio-oil yields while the HTL process can produce bio-oil with higher quality in heating value and moisture content. This section will provide an overview of the typical catalysts that are used for the upgrading of bio-oil quality in both the fast pyrolysis and HTL processes. 2.1 Hydrothermal liquefaction With a high moisture feedstock and gaseous, aqueous, and solid phase by-products, hydrothermal liquefaction is a method for converting biomass to bio-liquids that is performedin water at high pressures (5–20 MPa) and moderate temperatures of 300–400 °C. In contrast to other methods, its product has a high energy content and a distinctive feature of increased heat recovery. To create a reaction analogous to pyrolysis, hot compressed water is used in liquefaction as the reactant's catalyst. In liquefaction, other types of catalysts are crucial for increasing efficiency and minimising the development of tar and char. In this regard, heterogenous catalysts are popular that can provide high levels of stability, recyclability, and hydrogen selectivity. The literature has described the use of a variety of heterogeneous catalyst types, including zeolites and transition metals, to enhance the quality of bio-oil. Several catalysts, including Pt/C, Pd/C, Ni/SiO2-Al2O3, Ru/C, and zeolites, were evaluated for their impacts on the HTL of microalgae and were found to improve oil output by 10–22 wt% when compared to liquefaction without catalysts [15]. Wang et al. [16] examined the impact of transition metals impregnated as nitrate (Fe, Co, Mn, Ni, and Mo) on TiO2 as catalysts for microalgal liquefaction. The liquefaction of microalgae was accelerated by Ni/TiO2 catalysts, which resulted in bio-liquid with lower viscosity and enhanced hydrocarbon content. To maximise the production of biofuel, Nan et al. [17] investigated the effects of various heterogeneous catalysts on the HTL of cardboard. Results showed that the reaction temperature, water ratio, and residence duration all have a significant impact on the bio-oil output. At 300 °C for 30 min, Ni(NO3)2, produced the highest hydrogen yield (=11.46 mL/g), but the highest bio-oil yield (=47.14 percent) was seen at 275 °C for 30 min. Ni/Al2O3, Pt/Al2O3, and CoMo/Al2O3 were investigated by Biller et al. [18] for their impact on microalgal liquefaction. A lower yield of bio-oil is obtained from liquefaction process of Chlorella vulgaris microalgae without catalysis. Results showed that utilizing Ni/Al2O3 could boost bio-oil's heating value and encourage the deoxygenation of lipids to produce alkanes. When compared to zeolite and Na2CO3, nano-Ni/SiO2 catalyst delivered the best bio-oil yield [19]. Zeolites have also shown promises to increase the bio-oil yield in microalgal biomass. Hierarchical Zeolites (HZSM-5) are mostly used for removing oxygen out of oxygenated compositions. A higher yield of bio-oil was produced when zeolites and metals were combined than when zeolites were used alone [20]. The yield of oxygenated compounds declined whereas the yield of hydrocarbons was enhanced when a Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst was used (ketones, acids, alcohols, and phenols) [21]. The effects of K2CO3 and HZSM-5 catalysts using various Ni loadings were reported by Cheng et al. [22]. Among all catalysts, K2CO3 with Ni loading provided the highest yield and the lowest solid by-product. To liquefy biomass, supercritical ethanol was employed as a solvent and used to assess the performance of a Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst [23]. Compared to HZSM-5 alone, Zn/HZSM-5 had a stronger catalytic effect by yielding biofuel with the highest hydrocarbon percentage. To successfully scale up the approach, there are various issues with HTL that should be resolved. Heteroatoms like N, O, and S are sometimes found in microalgae-based HTL bio-oil. To reduce the generation of heteroatoms, temperature and catalyst modification are therefore required. Another instance is catalyst deactivation which has been documented and is thought to be caused by phenolic oligomers. However, it has been found that simple aromatic chemicals (such as guaiacol and phenol) and inorganic compounds are not the cause of catalyst deactivation. The optimum reactionfor measuring deactivation is the reformation of glycolic acid in the liquid phase. Additionally, it has been reported that the deactivation is due to the temperature that affects the synthesis of large molecular weight compositions [24]. 2.2 Catalytic pyrolysis Fast pyrolysis (FP) is a method for converting biomass into useful biofuels and chemical feedstocks. For bio-oil production, FP defines as cracking process that takes place without oxygen at temperatures ranging from 500 to 800 °C for 0.5–3 s. More biochar is formed when the residence time is longer, and the temperature is lower. Dried biomass (<10 %), small particles (<3 mm), and quick condensation of pyrolyzed vapour are preferred. Pyrolysis yields three distinct products: biochar, bio-oil, and gases, such as CO2 and CO (the most frequent), H2, hydrocarbons like methane and volatile carboxylic acids [25]. Increasing the moisture translates to high energy expenses as well as worse fuel yield and quality. Due to heat and mass transfer restrictions, larger particle sizes result in incomplete pyrolysis, and quick quenching avoids additional oxidation and cracking. Fast pyrolysis has many advantages, including the ability to operate at atmospheric pressure and at moderate temperatures (450 °C), or high yield of bio-oil (more than 70 %). However, as mentioned before, the inclusion of water and oxygen molecules in crude bio-oils generated from fast pyrolysis results in poor quality. Also, other disadvantages, such as high viscosity, storage instability, low heating value, and high acidity (corrosiveness) ​are also identified in the bio-oil produced in this process. Therefore, catalytic upgrading is employed as a solution to improve the bio-oil quality for different applications (especially biofuels). Chemical and thermocatalytic operations and physical upgrading methods could be used to improve the physicochemical qualities of bio-oil. For bio-oil upgrading, several catalytic processes including aldol condensation, ketonization, esterification, and Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) can be used [26]. Other upgrading techniques include catalytic cracking and deoxygenation over zeolites, as well as innovative technologies like catalytic plasma reactors. It's worth noting that physical upgrading approaches have received less attention compared to chemical upgrading methods. Three primary factors are critical in catalytic pyrolysis/upgrading: catalyst type, heating rate, and catalyst/feedstock ratio. Catalysts can considerably increase the composition of bio-oil during or after the pyrolysis process [27]. In the following, the in-situ bio-oil catalytic upgrading processes that has been used in recent years is briefly described, and for more details, readers are referred to [29]. Biomass conversion to fuel using in-situ catalytic rapid pyrolysis with zeolite catalysts opens up the possibility of generating gasoline-like aromatics. The acidity of the zeolite, along with its textural and topological characteristics, impact the amount of aromatic chemicals generated [28]. In general, noncatalytic pyrolysis produces more liquid products than the amount by catalytic pyrolysis where Y zeolite, for instance, is integrated on an active (alumina, silica-alumina) or inactive (silica) matrix in a commercialized equilibrium fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalyst. By using a catalyst, larger quantities of hydrogen were also observed [29]. Karnjanakom et al. [30] performed in-situ catalytic upgrading of bio-oil to aromatic hydrocarbons. The relative overall hydrocarbon quantity significantly grew when the catalyst/biomass ratio climbed to 8 wt-%. While the ratio between catalyst and biomass was more than 8 wt-%, the total relative hydrocarbon content decreased slightly, possibly due to the activation of secondary processes in which hydrocarbons were broken down into gases and coke during the longer residence time. Zeolite and biomass pre-treatment and different metal catalysts were studied in literature [31]. The vapour from fast pyrolysis of biomass was directly catalytically cracked (using HZSM-5 catalyst integrated with Fe, Zr, and Co) to enhance bio-oil properties. In addition, increasing the temperature of the catalytic reaction promoted the concentration and output of aromatic hydrocarbons significantly. The use of 4Fe/HZSM-5 boosted the production of naphthalene compositions, and 4Zr/HZSM-5 increased the generation of benzene derivatives when the 4CO/HZSM-5 catalyst was used to influence gas generation. Pre-treatment with HCl and NaBH4 also raised the hydrocarbon content; however, pre-treatment with NaOH mostly resulted in the synthesis of phenol. The catalytic fast pyrolysis of biomass was studied in a unique study that included methane aromatization [32]. In the presence of HZSM-5 zeolites, this fast pyrolysis technology can be employed as a solution to the high price of H2 usage in standard bio-oil upgrading procedures. In comparison to hemicellulose and lignin, cellulose produced more aromatic compounds. In addition, utilizing methane (rather than Helium) resulted in a higher HDO of lignin-derived phenols and a higher aromatic output. Table 2 demonstrates the catalysts that are used for bio-oil production with associated process conditions. A variety of zeolite catalysts (acidic, basic, and -alumina catalysts with doped metals, as well as their parental counterparts) were examined. The quality of the produced bio-oil was found to be highly dependent on the type of catalyst; nevertheless, the bio-oils acidity decreased dramatically while deoxygenation increased for all types of catalysts [33].MgO materials have recently been studied as catalysts (as an alternative to traditional acidic zeolite catalysts) for catalytic rapid pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass [34]. The MgO catalysts greatly reduced the oxygen contents of the resulting bio-oil and had equivalent or even higher performance than the industrial ZSM-5 catalyst. This is because oxygen was eliminated by the CO2 production route instead of CO and water synthesis in the case of ZSM-5 zeolite. However, formation of coke was marginally higher on MgO catalysts than on ZSM-5, although the produced coke was oxidised at low temperatures [34]. Another study investigated the performance of Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst for quick biomass pyrolysis. The Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst had better activity for oxygenate conversion and higher generation of aromatic hydrocarbons compared to the ZSM-5 catalyst. Furthermore, the yields of aromatic hydrocarbons increased significantly as the temperature incremented from 500 to 600 °C, but decreased as the temperature raised from 600 to 800 °C. Further polymerization reactions of aromatic hydrocarbons and oxygenates were hampered using the above-mentioned synthesised catalyst [35]. In a downdraft fixed bed reactor, a zeolite catalyst modified with copper was employed to improve bio-oil’s quality in a pyrolysis and upgrading operation. The hydrocarbon selectivity of high silica-zeolite was quite high. Moreover, by altering a small amount of copper, the selectivity was enhanced considerably [36]. 2.3 Challenges Even though catalytic pyrolysis improves bio-oil production and quality, some issues remain, including catalyst deactivation, clogging of reactor, formation of coke, and a high H2O content in the product. The combination of operations (catalytic pyrolysis and catalytic cracking) increases the yield and properties of the product. Catalysts and upgrading procedures are used to enhance bio-oil fuel efficiency, which raises the cost of production. Furthermore, bio-oil generation as a fuel replacement is currently not thought to be economically viable enough to be a viable replacement to petroleum fuels. To obtain maximal yields of the desired mono-phenol and mono-aromatic hydrocarbons, future research will focus on increasing HZSM-5 acidity and preventing coke deposition. In addition, more research into catalyst preparation and effects is required. Because of the complexity of bio-oil reactions and production, as well as the difficulty of managing several reactions occurring at the same time, designing an entire structure of bio-oil upgrading and fast pyrolysis is tough. Catalysts can help with this problem, but most of them are very costly and may be readily deactivated. The impacts of metal and oxide inclusion over diffusion, structure, topology, and stability aspects of the zeolites, as well as the feasibility of optimising aromatics yield (beyond 95 %), are the main issues of in situ catalytic rapid pyrolysis. Bio-oil upgrading can also be replaced by cracking bio-oils in the existence of solid acid catalysts using mono- and multifunctional zeolite catalysts. Because it works at atmospheric pressure and with the absence of hydrogen, this method is less expensive than ex-situ operations (like HDO) [37]. The main issue in biomass catalytic fast pyrolysis is catalyst swamping and deactivation because of alkaline ash in the system (from biomass). In this instance, direct interaction of the catalyst and the biomass must be prevented. As a result, before commercialising the technique, this problem must be discovered and resolved. To address this issue, an ex-situ procedure for reforming primary pyrolysis vapours has been proposed [38]. The catalyst being used in the thermochemical process needs to have suitable characteristics to endure the process and leads to great catalytic performance. Thermal stability is one of those essential characteristics for the utilized catalyst. Each thermochemical process operates with an optimum temperature depends on yield of the product. For instance, Demirbas [39] reported the optimal temperature for the highest yields of liquid in pyrolysis. This value is around 700 °C for almost all various biomass feedstocks. Although using a catalyst reduces the optimal process temperature, the catalyst should have a thermal stability up to 700 °C. Moreover, there are some morphological aspects of catalyst which are described in the next section. 3 3D printing of catalysts 3D printing or Additive Manufacturing (AM) is a process of stacking materials layer by layer to transmute a virtual artifact into a physical part. It is a unique fabrication method that allows the manufacturing of very complex geometries with great precision that would be difficult to achieve using conventional methods like casting and machining [40]. Moreover, it effectively gets rid of the limitations on design and fabrication that come with traditional production techniques [41]. A wide range of materials, including ceramic, glass, metals, polymers, and composite materials, can be fabricated using AM processes [42]. Popular power sources used in AM techniques include lasers and electron beams. There are a wide range of AM approaches, each of which operates with a certain type of material and energy source. The most dominant AM processes that are used in catalyst fabrication are demonstrated in Fig. 1 . Projection light is used in Digital Light Processing (DLP) printers to polymerize materials and create the pre-designed structures. As shown in Fig. 1a, light is bounced off a deformable mirror device (DMD) or through a liquid crystal screen to expose the photopolymer. Because a full layer is exposed at once, DLP consumes less photopolymer than Stereolithography (SLA) and has the potential for quicker manufacturing. This technology has substantial advantages over other 3D printing processes in terms of printing resolution, productivity, and operating conditions. It is used mostly in medical [43], jewelry [44] and automotive [45] industries. Powder bed fusion (PBF) is another technique for sintering or fusing atomized powder particles together using a heat source, usually a laser [46]. This is done one layer at a time as other additive procedures. Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) is one of the processes belonging to this category (Fig. 1b). SLA as displayed in Fig. 1c, is a technique that uses photochemical processes by concentrating an ultraviolet laser on a volume of photopolymer resin in the desired pattern, which solidifies the resin due to its photosensitivity [47]. The final product from SLA has a high level of accuracy and a nice surface finish. Fig. 1d shows Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) approach in which a material is heated and dispensed from a nozzle to construct layers of the final item [48]. Extrusion causes the material to solidify immediately. The method works well with thermoplastics, edible materials, elastomers, and clays. Robocasting (Fig. 1e), also known as direct ink writing (DIW) is a meso- and micro-scale additive manufacturing technique based on extrusion. In DIW, liquid-phase “ink” is dispensed through small nozzles at controlled flow rates and deposited along digitally determined routes layer-by-layer to create 3D structures [49]. Ceramics and metals are the most common materials for DIW. A recent review [51] of 3D-printed structured catalysts summarized the progress in the general processes and materials as well as its industrial applications (e.g., electrodes and reactors), but it failed to capture the morphology, design, and quality aspects which are critical for catalysts in biomass conversion applications. This section will focus on reviewing the recent advances in 3D-printed structured catalysts (e.g., zeolites) that potentially could be used for biomass-bio-oil applications. According to the form of the feedstock, these works are classified as slurry-, filament-, and powder-based methods. 3.1 Slurry-based 3D printing Slurry-based 3D printing operates with materials typically in the form of pastes or inks that contain the catalyst (or its precursor) particles, dependent upon the solid content and viscosity of the system [40]. There are many 3D printing processes in this category including SLA [52], DLP [53], Two-Photon Polymerization [54], Inkjet Printing [55] and DIW [56]. Among which, the most favorable one for catalytic printing is DIW because of its more reasonable operation cost and simpler material composition. The process starts with material preparation. The catalysts are mostly in the shape of powder, and they are mixed with dispersant, binder and deionized water. The deionized water is usually employed as a solvent for ceramics to avoid introducing the impurities. Moreover, the binder which is mostly polymers is essential for the printing process and can be used as the template to control the porosity of the catalyst structure. The slurry is provided by mixing these ingredients via different types of blenders until a homogeneous mixture is achieved. Dispersants are necessary to enhance particle detachment and prevent agglomeration or clumping. After the slurry is prepared, it is transferred to the 3D printer to begin the fabrication process. The two important parameters must be considered while making the slurry are: a) viscosity of mixture which highly affects the quality of the printed part and enables the proper extrusion, and b) controlling the particle size of the binder to obtain a catalyst with desired porosity and pore size distribution. After the part is printed, it is dried to remove the moisture and sintered or calcinated to remove the binder. In some cases, coagulant is added to regulate the rheological properties by increasing the viscosity. However, it is rarely used in 3D printing of catalysts. A wide range of catalysts have been successfully printed by adopting slurry-based techniques including zeolite [10,57–59], alumina [60,61], copper [62,63], silica [64], and its compound. 3D printing of structures with zeolite as a catalyst is one of the most important topics. Lefevere et al. [10] studied the effects of various binders on zeolite paste, including bentonite, colloidal silica, and aluminophosphate solution. As a catalyst, zeolite ZSM-5 is made from an aqueous solution of alumina, silica, and sodium hydroxide and has a fine pore size and high adsorptive characteristics. The mechanical properties and number of active sites was investigated and results [10] indicated that using a combination of binders can improve these properties. In another study [57], a highly absorbent structure was fabricated using DIW. Zeolites 13X, carboxymethylcellulose as a binder, and activated carbon were used to prepare the feedstock material. Adsorption equilibrium isotherms measurements were used to assess adsorption capabilities of the printed parts. The results showed that the textural properties of printed items have improved. Introducing metals in zeolite composition was another subject investigated by Li et al. [58]. The focus was to incorporate metal doping into ZSM-5 zeolite and test its performance in the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) reaction. Some metals including Cu, Cr, Mg, Zn, etc. were used as dopants. The influence of dopants on the physical and chemical properties of the doped monoliths was investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX) and NH3-TPD (temperature programmed desorption) analysis. The efficiency of these produced metal–doped zeolite monoliths in MTO reactions was investigated and compared to non-doped counterparts. Metal precursor solution was mixed into bentonite clay together with the zeolite to form metal-doped ZSM-5 monoliths. Calcination was used after printing to break down and eliminate the methyl cellulose that acted as a template. Mg/ZSM showed remarkable coke resistance due to the amount of occupied space in the micropores. The results of this research reveal that the Mg/ZSM-5 monolith with metal integration for the MTO method is a potential 3D-printed ZSM-5 monolith. 3D-printing of hierarchical zeolites (HZSM-5) as heterogeneous catalyst for the n-hexane cracking reaction was studied in literature [59]. A lab-scale 3D printer (Geetech®) was used to build monolithic zeolite catalysts. Samples with various types of zeolites were printed and compared, including HZSM-5, H-Beta, HY and pristine zeolites. The results reveal that the HZSM-5 zeolite monolith has a stronger selectivity for light olefins and has a more stable n-hexane cracking activity than powder zeolites. The other popularly investigated material as a catalyst or support is Alumina. Yang et al. [61] studied the influence of temperature and carrageenan (as a binder) concentration on the rheology of the paste and optimum slurry suitable for 3D printing process. To control the viscosity of the resulting mixture, alumina in the form of powder was used as the feedstock, together with ammonium citrate (as a dispersion) and carrageenan powders as a thermo-curing binder. A barrel retains the paste and uses gas pressure to propel it into a chamber. The paste is then extruded to the printing table through a screw extruder and solidified by hot airflow and the temperature of the print table. In a different study [60], alumina has been used as catalyst support along with Ni as its catalyst. CO2 hydrogenation to methanewas examined using Ni-alumina-based catalysts that were 3D printed into highly adjustable monolithic and multi-channel systems. In this study, the performance of a 3D-printed structure of Ni-alumina is compared with Octolyst® catalyst. Fig. 2 b and c show the fabrication of two catalyst using a DIW process. The comparative analysis indicated that the 3D-printed parts with commercial Octolyst® has superior performance for conversion of methane. As alumina proved to be a great catalyst support, it was also utilized in a study conducted in literature [62]. Alumina particles, aqueous copper (II) nitrate hemi(pentahydrate), Cu (NO3)2.2.5 H2O, and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (to modify the viscosity) were used to make the final ink. The supported copper catalyst plays a critical role in the Ullmann reaction to produce biaryl. Similarly, copper has been used as a catalyst support for the application of CO2 methanation [63]. Through analysing the morphology of the printed parts (Fig. 2d), the sintering temperature was identified as a critical parameter in which using lower sintering temperature reduced the inner porosity. To produce heterogeneous multi-catalytic multi-component reactions (MMCRs) catalyst, 3D printing of a silica monolith was performed [64]. The findings indicated that 3D printing of SiO2 monoliths was a feasible way to make monolithic Pd- and Cu-based MMCRscatalysts that are efficient, robust, and reusable. Arriaga et al. [65] conducted research on 3D printing of TiO2 catalyst which is mostly used in photocatalytic processes. An SEM analysis was carried out to compare the performance of the extruded parts with nanopowder TiO2, and an improvement of the structured catalyst for the photocatalytic processes was eventuated. 3.2 Filament-based 3D printing The material used in this category is in the form of filament and the structures are fabricated via a FDM type of printer. In this process, the printing material is mostly thermoplastic polymers such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polylactic acid (PLA), or high impact polystyrene (HIPS). Polymers are not known as good catalysts, due to their low surface areas and poor thermal stabilities. However, they can be combined with an active component to create a hybrid organic/inorganic product [66]. These characteristics make the printed polymers acceptable to be used as a template for monolithic catalyst preparation. There are two typical ways to print a product with filament-based technology as can be seen in Fig. 3 . The first method is defined as the pre-processing approach where the catalyst is introduced before the printing process by making a composite of polymer and catalyst material. In this method, the catalyst powder is added to melted polymer and mixed until a homogeneous mixture is achieved. After hardening, it is cut into to small granules and extruded to a desired diameter using an extruder machine. Producing composite filament is quite challenging, and a few problems might occur during this process, including filament diameter instability (pulsation), air bubbles in the filament's core, surface defects and ovalization [67]. The filament produced by this method is employed to print the catalyst structure. Afterwards, the product is sintered inside a furnace to attain a porous structure. The second filament-based means is defined as the post-processing approach. In this approach, the structure is printed with the polymer filament and further coated with the catalyst material. Various coating techniques can be applied by using solutions or thermal treatments. 3D printing of a composite filament was carried out by Mackiewicz et al. [11]. The research focused on developing and using functional 3D printing composite filaments with a catalyst substrate (nickel powder) integrated in a polymeric binder for 3D printing (PLA, Polyvinyl butyral (PVB) or ABS). The method of filament preparation varied according on the polymer utilised. For instance, a melting approach would be applied for PLA, whereas a solvent (acetone)-assisted process was used for PVB and ABS. Nickel powder was added in a precise ratio after melting PLA. To get a homogeneous consistency, the composite was mixed with a spatula. The mixture was then evenly dispersed on a foil substrate and hardened completely. The solid composite was chopped into small pieces for use in the filament extrusion process. The constructions are printed using an Ultimaker® S5 printer after the filaments were prepared. To remove organic moieties from the printed composite item, debinding with heat treatment is performed. Finally, the structure was fully sintered, resulting in a porous part. The impact of Ni-to-polymer ratio on the final porosity of various structures was discussed. Another study focused on the mechanical properties of printed samples using a composite filament of TiO2-ABS [69]. The presence of TiO2 within the polymer nanocomposite was confirmed using powder X-ray diffraction analysis. For samples with different ratios of TiO2, stress analysis was evaluated and discussed. In another research [70], a CuFeO2 structure is created from a composite filament that is made up of Cu and Fe components. The transition and composition were verified using XRD and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) /Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) analysis. For the hydrogen evolution and water oxidation reactions, 3D-printed graphene/PLA electrodes have been developed [71]. In this study, it was claimed that commercial filament contains metal impurities, which can act as catalysts for the reactions mentioned above. However, the solvent and post treatment method have a considerable impact on their reactivity. The presence of Fe and Ti impurities, as well as a low carbon-to-oxygen ratio, were linked to the optimal performance of the thermally treated 3D-printed graphene/PLA electrode for the hydrogen evolution reaction. As a result, researchers working in this field should be aware of the presence of metal impurities in commercial graphene/PLA filaments, as well as their significant impacts on electrocatalysis. The coating routine was investigated in [68] with a goal of creating Cu-BTC (benzenetricarboxylate) Metal-organic Frameworks (MOFs) for Methylene Blue removal. The component was first printed with ABS filament and went through a few repeated cycles in Cu and BTC solutions (see Fig. 3b); then, Cu-BTC/ABS composites were ultimately produced. By synthesising novel frameworks with MOFs and polymers, 3D printing is a viable technique for producing materials with application other than adsorption. Similar work was also reported in literature [72]. The 3D-printed part was made of high-impact-polystyrene filament and went though a sulfonation process to make the monoliths work as an acid catalyst. 3.3 Powder-based 3D printing Powder-based 3D printing employs powder as the feedstock which can be a combination of ceramic and metal catalyst. The particles are merged using either liquid binders or powder fusion with the help of heat energy from a laser beam. The powder fusion approaches mostly investigated for the catalytic technology are Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) and Selective Laser Melting (SLM). These methods are very similar with the difference that in SLS the laser only sinters the loose powder together rather than melting the entire particles [73]. The SLS approach frequently results in undesirable and uncontrolled porosity inside the material, which has a negative effect on the overall strength of the produced component. The major benefit of selective laser melting or sintering is the large range of materials that can be used, including Al-based alloys [74], Fe-based alloys [12], copper-based alloys [75], and metal composites. Moreover, compared to other 3D printing methods, the strength and mechanical properties of the metal and ceramic catalysts are superior in these two processes. Also, 3D printing of catalyst with higher precision is achievable, especially in terms of more complicated geometries like porous structures. However, these technologies are more expensive than others with more material waste. The process usually starts by preparing a composite powder of metal and ceramic. This operation is less complicated compared to other AM processes, and some of the compositions are commercially available. Typically, de-ionized water and dispersants are utilized to make a homogeneous mixture. However, prior to the printing process, the mixed powder is usually dried to remove any leftover moisture. The microporosity of the final structure is controlled by the ratio of the powder composition. Those micropores are produced after the printing process through dealloying. In this section, some instances of SLS and SLM printing of catalysts are presented. The degradation of methyl orange was examined using Zr-based Bulk Metallic Glass (BMG) and copper as a catalyst [75]. A great photocatalytic performance was achieved using complex geometries such as lattice hollow and cubic structures, which showed to be promising for functional applications. A number of optimised process parameters were used to print the samples directly. Then, free corrosion was employed to dealloy the structure until a copper nanostructure was achieved. The findings indicated that the lattice structure with the highest specific area has the best catalytic efficacy and cycling stability. A free-standing hierarchical nano-porous copper material was also introduced as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for methanol oxidation [75]. It was created using a SLM 3D printing approach and a dealloying operation. Cu-Mn powder composition with a specific ratio was printed and alloyed during the fusing process. Nanoscale porous structure was obtained in the last step of the production process through chemical dealloying by immersing the 3D Cu/Mn alloy structures in (NH4)2SO4 solution to remove Mn. The findings showed that a computer-controlled hierarchical structure with macro- and nano-scaled pores could be used to promote and direct mass transport while also improving catalytic capabilities. Essa et al. [74] employed SLM to fabricate catalyst bed samples using alumina ceramic lattices for the application of High-Test Peroxide (HTP) monopropellant thruster. The purpose of the study was to increase the HTP decomposition. Different wash coatings were used to increase the surface areas of the specimens, including gamma alumina and a combination of gamma alumina and carbon nanotubes. Alumina was chosen as the catalyst bed substance because it has excellent mechanical qualities at high temperatures. Incorporating lattice structures into catalyst samples resulted in a great surface area and acceptable pressure drop. The performance of samples with different coating materials were evaluated, and results indicated a great improvement with additively manufactured catalyst beds. SLM was also used in fabricating custom-made electrodes with a desired shape for electrochemical applications [77]. Stainless steel was chosen as the main feedstock; however, steel cannot be used directly as an electrode due to its slow electron transfer and high charge transfer resistance. As a result, a conductive catalyst such as IrO2 was deposited on the steel electrode’s surface. The 3D printed steel-IrO2 electrodes demonstrated excellent capacitive and catalytic properties in alkaline liquids, as well as Nernstian behaviour as a potentiometric pH sensor. In the custom-made fabrication of electrochemical devices, the use of 3D printing to fabricate sophisticated 3D electrode designs on-site has shown to be a game-changer. The integration of metal catalyst in SLS structures was examined by Wei et al. [12] for the application of self-catalytic reactor (SCR) for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, CO2 hydrogenation, and CO2 reforming of CH4. Metals like Fe, Co, and Ni have all been utilised separately as catalysts. Metal 3D printing provides the control functions to tailor the catalytic product distribution, according to the Co-SCR geometrical investigations. According to the findings, Fe-SCR and Co-SCR give highly selective liquid fuel synthesis in high-pressure Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and CO2 hydrogenation. The Ni-SCR has a high CO2 and CH4 conversion rate in high-temperature dry reforming of methane. Examples of the 3D printed parts are illustrated in Fig. 4 . 3.4 Challenges Morphological design and accuracy of the printed catalyst have a considerable impact on the catalytic performance. In the slurry-based approaches, the most critical factors of printing accuracy are material viscosity and dispersion, nozzle diameter, and printing parameters, such as layer thickness, printing speed, infill, and post treatments operations like drying, sintering, etc. The uniform dispersion of catalyst particles in the slurry has a significant impact on the quality and morphological accuracy of printing parts. The important conditions for attaining outstanding printability with DIW are the slurry's pseudoplastic nature, settling upon dispensing, and uniform dispersion of the particles. While preparing the slurry, the particle sizes should be an order of magnitude smaller than the resolution of the final part to make sure that a high-resolution product is achieved. Getting a high-density printed part without clogging the nozzle is one of the most difficult challenges in DIW. Only a slurry with proper homogeneous dispersion of the particles could make this possible. In order to obtain a desirable product, the rheology of the slurry, particle size distribution, and moisture qualities should all be adjusted. Compared to polymer 3D printing, the impact of process parameters on the dimensional accuracy and surface quality are barely discussed in the catalytic 3D printing investigation. In general, a higher printing speed reduces the time it takes to fabricate a layer and makes it easier to maintain a consistent flow. However, printing with high path accuracy can be problematic for a complicated design with sharp corners which are difficult to fabricate. Therefore, it's critical to experiment with various printing speed and find the optimal value. The impact of printing speed was examined for robocast printing of zirconia before the sintering operation [11]. The range of dimensional accuracy was resulted between 0.14 % and 1.49 % and surface roughness is between 25 and 43 μm. It was demonstrated that the accuracy was highly dependent on the relation between layer thickness and infill whereas roughness relied more on interaction between printing speed and infill. Similar deficiency is also observed in filament-based and powder-based studies. An optimal set of process parameters must be set to reach a desirable dimensional accuracy and better-controlled structure morphology. The relation between printing speed and nozzle size, travel duration, and density of infill has been investigated by Perez et al. [79], but the understanding between process parameters and desired morphology of 3D printed catalysts remains unknown. Most studies on 3D-printed catalyst served as a proof of concept with simple catalyst structure/patterns (2-dimension or 2.5-dimension where there is no variance in Z direction). These structures are typically comprised of uniform pores and a single material, which do not fully exploit the freedoms of AM to enhance catalytic performance. Having a multifunctional reactor can improve the efficiency of chemical reactions. Some studies attempt to fabricate bi-functional catalysts using 3D printing. However, they made the catalyst composite before the fabrication process. As demonstrated in Sections 3.1-3.3, the ratio of the catalyst to the base or support material has a great influence on the reaction rate and final yield. Yet, the capability of fabricating multiple materials and spatially controlling the catalyst deposition is missing. 4 Design and optimization of the catalyst structure Understanding the interactions between catalysts and biomass feedstocks is essential for controlling and optimising the performance of thermochemical processes in biomass conversion applications. The morphology of the catalyst and the surrounding chemical environment have a significant impact on reaction [80]. As discussed previously, some of the parameters such as the concentration of reactants, surface area, temperature, and catalysts, affect the rate of a chemical reaction. Due to the fixed process condition of the thermochemical processes, tuning the environmental conditions is not the focus of this review article, and the main attention goes to the morphological design of catalyst structures. As discovered in Section 2, zeolites are one of the popular catalysts used in biomass industry due to their microporous structures [81]. However, transport restrictions frequently have a negative impact on their overall performance. A conceptual illustration is presented in Fig. 5 a explaining how reactant need to diffuse over a space varying from millimeter to nanometer scale (depends on catalyst pore type) until arriving to the active site which is located on the internal surface. After interacting in surface reactions, the product must diffuse out to the outside surface. Wide pores can be used as molecular highways to help overcome transportation restrictions, manage product dispersion, and counteract the effects of catalyst deactivation [82]. Improving the diffusivity requires reducing the reactants particle size or enhancing the pore network structure. Although having a large internal surface area is imperative for the higher distribution of active species, increasing nanopores inside the structure provides more diffusion limitations as a result of the confinement effect. Therefore, porous channels with wider diameters are needed for greater diffusivity. Thus, a proper design of a structural network is essential to maximize efficiency. As reported by Coppens et al. [82], the optimised hierarchical catalyst can improve the catalytic activity by 2.8 times while reducing catalyst weight by 45 % comparing to a mesoporous benchmark catalyst. Porosity, pore size distribution, and particle size must at least be included in the structural parameters for optimization. Pore connectivity and spatial crystal or porosity distribution are other significant factors needed to be considered. Therefore, development of a hierarchical catalyst must make it possible to effectively regulate the morphological parameters including, pore size distribution, pore volume and pore network. 4.1 Optimization of porosity and pore size distribution There are several studies attempt to demonstrate the effect of different parameters on catalyst performance. Some of these parameters are related to the geometry of the pore network and a few associated with the environment, including temperature, pressure, etc. For instance, the effectiveness of a meso-macro porous commercial catalyst for the autothermal reforming of methane on Ni/Al2O3 is demonstrated to be greatly enhanced by optimising the macro-porosity and size of the macropores [83]. The mathematical model was initially defined by the relation between effective diffusivity, meso-porosity and meso-pore size, and using the effectiveness factor as an objective function. By considering a maximum value of effectiveness factor, adjusting the macropore size to 1 μ m and macroporosity to an optimal value around 0.2–0.3, could increase overall catalytic activity by 40–300 %. In another research, Szczygiel [8] constructed a mathematical model to optimize the radius of the micro- and macropores for the reforming catalysts. The proposed structure was also determined to control the diffusion resistance and the contribution of kinetics to the overall rate. In order to describe the mass transport in the catalyst grain under the circumstances of reforming, a general equation was derived. The model makes it possible to calculate pertinent impacts and identify the appropriate porous structure to regulate how much kinetics and diffusion resistance contribute to the process' overall rate. For the reforming catalyst that had been used to fill the reactor of an experimental device, efforts were conducted to determine the optimal radius of the pores. The effective diffusion was regarded for optimizing the pore size distribution of Alumina as catalyst support [84]. In this regard, tortuosity factor ( τ ) was presented to evaluate the porosity ( ε p ) , effective diffusion ( D e f f ) and molecular diffusion ( D m ) of the alumina (see Equation (1) [84]). (1) D eff = D m . ε p / τ Although all alumina supports had equal total porosities, the observed tortuosity values are actually different and significantly greater than those anticipated by these theoretical models. The assumption of a two-level pore network organization, whose properties can be entirely calculated from a traditional nitrogen adsorption isotherm, has been used to reconcile this disparity. The textural features of mesoporous alumina can be evaluated using this straightforward methodology, which is helpful for the design and optimization of many catalytic processes. Time as an additional factor affecting the catalytic activity is reported in another research [85]. In this regard, a mathematical optimization method is given, which considers the catalytic performance over time on stream. The objective function is defined as reaction yield which is described by macro-porosity, pore size, surface area and reactant concentration. The optimal values for meso-/macropore diameters, surface area, meso-/macro-porosity, and grain radius were evaluated. As a result, the mesoporous structure indicates superior performance in the beginning. However, it starts to fall during the time and show the worse performance after 10 days. On the contrary, hierarchical structures demonstrates higher rate in the long term. 4.2 Optimizing the pore network Pore connectivity is another significant factor highly affecting the mass transfer and the amount of active site inside the catalyst structure. In this regard, Liu et al. [86] provided an optimal pore network using the CFD model by considering the effect of concentration and temperature gradient along with pore size, porosity and pellet shape inside a reactor. The optimal structures at pellet level and reactor level were compared to each other, and the results indicated that the catalyst performance must be considered at the reactor level for industrial use. Liu et al. [87] explained the trade-off between reaction rate and diffusion and offered a desired range of porosity for monodisperse and bi-disperse catalyst pellets under various environmental conditions. These types of structures are demonstrated in Fig. 5b. The black regions present the nanoporous material and white regions are the diffusion channels. A combination of bi-disperse structures forms the bimodal ones (like 3 × 3 bidisperse as indicated in Fig. 5b). In this study, the pore size and porosity were optimized for monodisperse and bi-disperse networks. The results present an improved catalytic activity for the bi-disperse structure (50 % – 175 %) as well as lower amount of catalyst material (10 % − 18 %) in comparison to monodisperse structures. The electrode performance for the lithium-ion battery was another case study of Ye et al. [88]. This work created an analytical model based on the relationship between porosity, diffusion, and tortuosity to optimise the hierarchical pore network. The objective function was presented as the effective tortuosity which needed to be minimized and the size of the pore channels was the optimization variable. The lower porosity and higher electrode thickness demonstrate superior performance in terms of energy density of electrodes compared to the benchmark and without chemical modification of the materials. The reaction yield of a zeolite catalyst pellet using a composite of meso- and macropores are shown to be almost twice than the pellet that is constructed only by macropores with the same macro-porosity [89]. A numerical optimization method was used to maximize the reaction yield in the ethylating of benzene. The mathematical method defines the effectiveness factor by describing the reaction rate, diffusion and the concentration of ethylene and benzene. In another study conducted by Becker et al. [90], it was shown that activity and product selectivity of Fischer-Tropsch catalysts are significantly impacted by diffusional limitations in the porous network. It has been demonstrated that the presence of transport channels permits an extension of the diffusion length while preserving high reaction rates and selectivity. Also, through the improvement of the transport pore fraction, productivity can be raised up to 47 %. In order to improve the conversion of nickel metalloporphyrin in the crude oil, Rao and Coppens [91] mathematically tailored nano- and macropores in a large pore network of a hierarchical structured hydrodemetalation catalyst. In this study, an optimization model of the broad pore network is proposed for diffusion-limited reactions that are being deactivated in the areas filled with nano-pores of a hierarchical structure catalyst. A scaled yield that represents the objective function was defined using the reaction yield, and the broad pore size of bi-disperse and bimodal structure was optimized and compared considering one year time on stream. As a result, compared to the yield achieved from a uniform nano-porous catalyst, the integrated reaction rate of the optimum hierarchical catalysts was reported over 8 times greater. The ideal hierarchical catalyst uses around 21 % less catalytic material than the pure nano-porous one over the course of a year of operation. They used relation between effectiveness factor and thiele modulus as presented in Equation (2). (2) Φ = V S r c 0 2 ∫ c c c 0 D e f f r c d c - 1 2 where, V is the volume of the catalyst particle​, S is the external surface area of the catalyst particle​, r is reaction rate​, D e f f defines the effective diffusivity in the porous catalyst, c refers to concentration​, c 0 is the concentration on the external surface of the catalyst and c c is typically assumed to be zero for fast enough reactions. Prachayawarakorn-Mann [92] simplified the problem by considering a 2D pore network and attempted to optimize the network for better reactivity. Fig. 5c displays the investigated 2D networks. The black region is the nano-porous area, and the small and large pore channels are presented in yellow. The relation between tortuosity and thiele modolus (see Equation (1)) indicates the objective function in which less tortuosity results in more reactivity. Moreover, the performance was evaluated by effectiveness factor presented in Equation (3) [92]. The findings showed the minimum shielding in which large channels positioned in its margins had the highest reactivity compared to others and the worst case resulted from the random structures. In fact, the minimum shielding is 8 times more reactive than the random network. (3) η = tanh Φ Φ Wang et al. [93] compared the optimal networks in Fig. 5b (bimodal, bi-disperse and monodisperse) in terms of yield. The characteristics of the nano-porous material, such as its kinetics and texture (more specifically, its pore size), are predetermined and are not changed during optimization. The yields from the optimum bimodal and bi-disperse catalysts are approximately the same and can be much higher than those from a monodisperse catalyst. Therefore, the bi-disperse structures with the optimised channel volume fraction and channel diameter ought to be preferred in practice because they are simpler to synthesise, have nearly identical catalytic performance to the bimodal ones, and have a significantly higher production rate than the monodisperse ones. The bimodal structure was also considered in [95] as fractal-like pore hierarchies and compared with the optimal uniform architectures (bi-disperse). Again, they employed the yield as the objective function and attempt to optimize the geometry of the network by maximizing the yield. The performance of the optimal structures was compared to that of self-similar, fractal-like pore hierarchies, and it was discovered that the latter could be made to provide the same effectiveness factor as the optimal ones. This finding suggests that fractal-like catalysts operate very close to optimality, even though their structure differs greatly from that of the true optima. To examine the direct impact of pore assembly on diffusion and reaction in FCC catalyst particles, 2D networks were applied in study conducted by Nafaty-Mann [94]. Different pore architectural structures, such as random, spiralled positively, spiralled negatively, structured, and interspersed 2D networks, were examined considering the burn-off reaction in coked particles like zeolites.The spiral positively defined by locating the larger pore in the perimeter of the catalyst while the negative one means an interior-pored network. The interspaced structure presented in Fig. 5d performs better than the other structural configurations in terms of reaction rate and the amount of time needed for full coke combustion in the network. The optimization problem is not only limited to the performance of the catalysis as the main objective function but also is investigated in other aspects which are directly affecting the catalytic process. To this end, the ratio of some environmental parameters on producing desired specific surface area for the synthesis application is determined by means of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) [96]. This study used incomplete carbonised glucose (ICG) as the template and polyethylene glycol as a surfactant to hydrothermally manufacture mesoporous NiO-ICG catalysts. Five widely used learning systems including quick propagation, batch back propagation, incremental back propagation, Levenberg-Marquardt, and genetic algorithm were used to apply a multilayer feed-forward neural network. Modeling was carried out to determine how various hydrothermal reactions, including metal ratio, surfactant and template concentrations, and calcination temperature, would affect the predicted surface areas of the produced catalyst. The most influential factor on the surface area (among the chosen effective parameters) was the calcination temperature, which had a relative effectiveness of 29.97 % whereas the concentration of the incomplete carbonized glucose was the least effective one. The specific surface area measured had an error of 9.45 %, which was noticeably close to the amount predicted by the model. In the presence of coking-induced deactivation, a 3D network of porous structure was suggested by Ye et al. [97] and used to optimise the catalyst's porosity, pore size distribution and pore connectivity. The goal was to produce catalyst particles that are very resistant to deactivation caused by coking for the propane dehydrogenation. The mathematical model used for optimization was broke down into three components: the pore network, the reaction and diffusion modelling equations, and the coking and deactivation equation models. Two types of networks including random uniform distribution and bimodal were provided to present the pore connectivity model. The pore channels were designed in cylindrical shape in which radius and length of these channels along with surface area were utilized to describe the reaction and diffusion model. The mathematical presentation of the coke accumulation over time in a cylindrical pore was also provided. The objective function, which takes into account a catalyst particle's activity and stability, is the time-averaged propene production rate per unit catalyst volume. As a result, it was proven that the unimodal network with larger pore size in outer zones and with an average pore diameter of 500 nm was up to 14-folds more active than the benchmark. A correct optimization approach requires sufficient understanding of synthesis, mass transport properties and morphology. In this context, Stoeckel et al. [98] introduced a method to describe the morphology of the meso- and macro-porous silica monoliths. They managed to reconstruct the 3D model via analyzing the 2D images obtained from the tomography scan. The findings indicate that the macropore and mesopore spaces have a very similar topology but have different geometrical characteristics. It has also been revealed that the 3D structures can be deemed significant while optimizing the hierarchical porous structure [99]. The presented paper investigates the random 3D networks and their influence on reaction rate and diffusivity. 4.3 Challenges Understanding the relationship between their synthesis, morphology, and mass transport qualities is necessary for the targeted optimization of their functional features. But for multi-size channel catalyst architectures, there hasn't been a precise and comprehensive morphological description. Some studies examined the influence of porosity and pore size distribution without considering pore connectivity [8,83–85], and some attempt to investigate pore network only [87,90,93,95]. A 2D pore network has been studied in most of the cases, and the same behavior in other directions was assumed to lower the computational cost. However, porous structures have very complicated geometry in which tailoring their physical structures is a big challenge due to manufacturing limitations. Therefore, a comprehensive study requires the exploration of the impact of 3D network along with other parameters like pore size distribution, porosity and surface area. Ye et al. [97] attempted to consider these facts and make more extensive research. However, their study can be improved by considering other types of networks. Since it was proved by Prachayawarakorn-Mann [92] that random network has much lower efficiency than others. Moreover, only a limited number of types of networks are presented and investigated for various applications rather than developing a mathematical model to tailor the pore connectivity in an optimal way. The other significant gap is that the manufacturing constraints including catalyst particle size, resolution of the manufacturing method, etc. were not considered. 5 Future research directions There are both new and ongoing challenges, some of which were mentioned in prior sections and require considerable amount of research and development. Structured catalyst 3D printing has been increasingly popular in recent years and is still evolving in other fields. Although some progress has been achieved, the following areas still require further study for biomass conversion applications. 5.1 Development of a comprehensive design framework for structured catalysts As already indicated in Section 2, most of the studies focused on various compositions of catalysts to provide the desirable catalyst architecture. Through understanding of the process, the impact of catalyst morphology on its performance becomes apparent. For instance, a hierarchical structure of catalyst meaning a micro/macro-porous composition have been proposed in numerous chemical pathways of biomass conversion [5]. However, the disconnection between BBC and proper catalyst fabrication method will make the research even more obscure. As discussed, tuning the macro channels which is one of the most challenging design criteria to improve the diffusivity and proper arrange of pore connectivity, can be controlled via 3D printers during the fabrication process. Since the investigation of using structured catalyst for thermochemical process of biomass conversion has been rare, there is a lot of room for research in this area through working on structured catalyst with optimal 3D network. The vast majority of studies focused on optimizing 2D networks without considering other significant parameters like surface area and porosity. Therefore, a comprehensive design approach needs to be developed for biomass thermochemical reactors. It is also expected that the optimal network can alleviate the coke formation of zeolites. 5.2 Integration of manufacturing constraints into catalyst design As discussed, a suitable design strategy must include the manufacturing limitation for a practical engineering design. The 3D printers can mitigate the manufacturing restrictions, but they are also limited to a certain amount of resolution. Depending on the reactant’s particle size, utilizing lower macro-pores can enhance the catalytic performance by increasing the surface area and number of active sites. Therefore, upgrading the printers for fabrication of catalyst structures with higher resolution is always desirable and is expected in the near future for this application. One of the options is to introduce ceramic particles in high resolution AM methods like DLP process [100]. Also, the reactant’s particle size can be tuned based on the catalyst pore size. However, a proper relation between catalyst morphology and reactant’s particle size is imperative. Another AM challenge which needs consideration is the accuracy of the fabricated part which must be comparable to the design artifact. The printing parameters and material properties are the significant factors affecting accuracy of the printing sample [101]. According to the literature, the impact of these parameters on the accuracy (in the catalytic 3D printing area) is still unknown and requires more attention. 5.3 Development of multi-functional catalysts for diversified yields The other benefit of three-dimensional fabrication is the capability of multi-material printing. Since different catalysts have various morphological properties, the suitable composition of the catalysts can enhance the morphology and the overall efficiency. Norouzi et al. [102] showed that the interconnected structures with a composition of zeolite (with magnetic properties) and hydrochar can operate as channels which may lead to increased reactant density. However, most of the compositions are made in homogeneous form and the density, of catalyst material is not spatially controlled for the specific application. This idea was demonstrated in the study conducted by Thongthai et al. [104] for the conversion of CO2 to methane in which different catalyst zones were developed inside the reactor to target a specific reaction in each step of the process. The AM technologies are great candidates to easily control the material composition with desired density. AM enables us to easily examine various catalyst combinations and supports to enhance upgrading not only bio-oils but also other products like biochar and syngas. 6 Conclusion The presented study conducted a review of the most used methods and catalysts for upgrading bio-oils from biomass conversion. Among the existing literature for this application, an optimal design and manufacturing approach is still missing which opens many doors for further investigation. The promotion of the bio-oil quality for direct use as fuel or chemical compounds was the main concept in this paper. We believe that using structured catalyst in thermochemical reactions enables researchers to further develop optimal catalyst design which results in greater catalytic performance and quality of the products. The optimization studies indicate that using 3D network with larger channels on the outer side along with proper relation between surface area and porosity is desired. Also, among the presented studies, the use of 3D printing methods was devised to fabricate the complicated design geometries. The ability to control the macro channels (controlling the network) along with tuning material composition are key to undertaking AM technologies as a suitable fabrication process. It is believed that the offered methodology can provide potential research opportunities with the focus on improving catalytic performance in biomass conversion.

        "dc:description": "The devastative effects of traditional fossil fuel consumption have made biomass (e.g., plants, wood, and waste) a widely used renewable source of energy. The variety in biomass properties makes tunable catalysts an essential ingredient to promote reactions for desired molecule outputs. Catalysts with optimal catalytic performance are typically structured with complicated morphology, such as high porosity and sophistic pore network, which makes it challenging for catalyst fabrication. Recent progress in utilizing 3D printing as the fabrication method has demonstrated great potential of handling the complex structure while improving catalytic performance; however, rare work has focused on biomass-bio-oil conversion (BBC). With the aim of developing the optimal structured catalysts for BBC applications, this paper particularly reviewed 1) typical catalysts used for biomass conversion applications, 2) 3D printed catalysts, and 3) design and optimization of structured catalysts. It is found that the BBC is often isolated from manufacturing and focused more on different catalyst composition with transition metals to provide the desired catalyst architecture and further to improve upgrading of the BBC product. Current work on 3D-printed catalysts also show deficiency in several aspects including formation of coke and catalyst deactivation, lack of a comprehensive design for the catalyst structure (e.g., mostly 2D structures), absence of manufacturing constraints in design operation, and insufficient resolution of 3D printing methods. To solve these issues, several potential research directions and opportunities are discussed at the end of the study.",
