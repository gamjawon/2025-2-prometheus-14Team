Graphical abstract A hierarchical micro-meso-macroporous Beta zeolite (HB) was developed by a steam-assisted crystallization method and was employed for cobalt Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Meso-macroporous silica (HS), alumina modified meso-macroporous silica (HAS) and conventional Beta zeolite (CB) were used for comparison. Structural characterization indicated that the as-synthesized HB exhibited nanosized Beta zeolite crystallites and a hierarchical micro-meso-macroporous structure. The HB supported catalyst showed very high isoparaffins selectivity because of the isomerization reaction at the strong acidic sites of the Beta zeolite, while due to its good macroporous structure, which is in favor of reducing the internal diffusion limitations, the methane selectivity was kept as low as HAS supported catalysts. In this paper, we use large particle catalysts for evaluation, which are very close to industrial condition. And the conclusions obtained may be very important for the design of new Fischer-Tropsch catalysts. Keywords Fischer–Tropsch Synthesis Isoparaffins selectivity Internal diffusion limitations Cobalt 1 Introduction As an important heterogeneous catalytic polymerization process, Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS) is expected to produce super-clean fuel and valuable chemicals from various non-petroleum carbon resources such as coal, gas and biomass [1,2]. Among the reported FTS catalysts, due to its excellent properties such as high activity, low activity for the competing water gas shift (WGS) reaction and high selectivity of C5+ hydrocarbons, supported cobalt catalyst is one of the most widely used catalyst for the low-temperature Fischer–Tropsch synthesis [3]. As the FTS product is believed to follow the Anderson–Schulz–Flory distribution, the product distribution is very wide and the desired hydrocarbon fractions (diesel and gasoline ranges) is not very high [4,5]. In order to produce diesel or gasoline, additional refining processes are usually required, which always significantly increase the cost and energy consumption [6,7]. Therefore, it is of great interest to design bifunctional catalyst for the FTS reaction to directly convert of syngas to hydrocarbons of certain carbon number and with a branched structure at the same time. In recent years, many research groups combined Fischer-Tropsch catalysts with zeolites to prepare bifunctional catalysts to increase the proportion of isoparaffins and middle distillate [8–10]. Zhang et al. prepared a series of ZSM-5/SBA-15 compound supported cobalt catalysts [11]. The ZSM-5/SBA-15 composite supported catalysts showed superior catalytic performance as compared to the single material supported catalysts. However, in this system, the cobalt active sites are far away from the acid sites of the zeolite, so that a large amount of the product directly diffuses into the catalyst bed, losing the opportunity for further reforming. Capsule catalyst can overcome this problem well because the Fischer-Tropsch product formed inside the catalyst must pass through the zeolite shell, where sufficient hydrocracking and isomerization would occur [12]. Tsubaki et. al prepared a capsule catalyst by coating a H-ZSM-5 membrane onto the surface of the pre-shaped Co/SiO2 pellet [13]. In the prepared capsule catalyst, the C10+ hydrocarbons were suppressed completely and the selectivity of middle isoparaffins was considerably improved. However, in the capsule catalyst, microporous structure of the zeolite is very detrimental to the mass transfer of reactants and products, which leads to excessive cracking of the Fischer-Tropsch products, resulting in a large amount of gaseous products. In order to solve this problem, many researchers have prepared mesoporous zeolites, utilizing the mesoporous channels to solve the problem of mass transfer [14–16]. However, few researchers have applied zeolite with macroporous structures to cobalt-based Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. As we all know, in order to keep advisable pressure gradients and heat transfer, packed-bed Fischer-Tropsch synthesis reactors always require large pellet catalysts (1–3 mm), resulting in serious internal diffusion limitations, which would decrease Fischer-Tropsch synthesis rates and C5+ selectivity [17–19]. In our previous research, we have demonstrated that introducing of additional macropores is expected to be an effective way to reduce internal diffusion limitations in large pellet catalyst [20]. Many other researches have also demonstrated the effect of macropores on mass transfer and diffusion [21,22]. As discussed above, zeolite with macroporous structures is expected to be a kind of good support: on the one hand, the isoparaffins selectivity can be increased because of its rich acidic sites, on the other hand, internal diffusion limitations could be reduced due to its macroporous structures. In the present work, the performance of cobalt Fischer-Tropsch synthesis catalyst supported on a micro-meso-macroporous Beta zeolite was presented. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of supports and catalysts Meso-macroporous silica monolith was prepared according to our previous report [23]. The prepared meso-macroporous silica monolith was then grinded into 10–20 mesh (800–1700 μm) and was noted as HS. The alumina modified meso-macroporous silica support was prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation method. According to the different loading amount of Al2O3, the prepared samples were noted as HAS (Al2O3 loading of 0.8%) and HAS10 (Al2O3 loading of 10%). The hierarchical Beta zeolite was prepared by steam-assisted crystallization (SAC) method using HS as precursor. The specific preparation process was as followed: A desired amount of Al(NO3)3·9H2O and NaOH was dissolved in a certain amount of TEAOH solution(25 wt%). The as prepared HS was then impregnated into the solution described above. After ultrasonic for 10 min, dried at room temperature for 24 h and at 60 °C for 12 h, the mixture became a dry gel. The dry gel and H2O (2 mL) were sealed in a Teflon-lined steel autoclave (150 mL), and crystallization was conducted at 150 °C for 3 days. The sample was removed, washed with water and dried at 60 °C for 6 h and then calcined at 550 °C for 6 h with a rate of 1 °C/min. The prepared sample was subjected to ion exchange for transformation into the H-form and noted as HB [24]. It should be noted that HB has similar Si/Al ratio to HAS. The conventional Beta zeolite with the similar Si/Al ratio to HB was purchased from Nanjing JCNANO. The same ion exchange procedure was taken for the conventional Beta zeolite, and was named as CB. The resulted materials were used to prepare cobalt catalysts and noted as Co/HS, Co/HAS, Co/HAS10, Co/HB and Co/CB respectively. 2.2 Catalyst characterizations A JSM-7001 F scanning electron microscope (SEM) was employed to observe the morphology of the supports, operating at 5.0–15.0 kV. Nitrogen sorption was measured with a Micro Active for ASAP 2460 2.01 instrument at liquid nitrogen temperature. The specific surface areas of the samples were determined by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. Mesoporous size distributions were obtained by applying the BJH formalism to the desorption branch of the isotherms. Microporous size distributions were obtained by the Horvath–Kawazoe (HK) method. The phase structures of the catalysts was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), performed at room temperature on a PANalytical Empyrean X’pert powder diffractometer operated at 50 kV and 50 mA with monochromatized Cu Kα radiation. The Scherrer’s equation was used to calculate the average size of the Co3O4 crystallite from the most intense Co3O4 peak at 2θ = 36.9° [[25]]. The average Co pellet size dx in the reduced catalysts was then obtained from the corresponding Co3O4 crystallite size by applying the relative molar volume correction dx = 0.75 d (Co3O4). Then, the Co° metal dispersions can be calculated using the equation: D = 96/d(Co°) [26]. In order to observe the active component distributions and morphology of the catalysts, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed, operated at 200 kV with an JEOL: JEM·2010 FEF microscope. The acid strength of the samples was determined by NH3 temperature programmed desorption method. The samples (50 mg) were pretreated at 200 °C in Ar flow (30 mL/min) for 2 h to remove the adsorbed H2O in the samples. After the sample was cooled to 80 °C, the gas was switched to a NH3/Ar mixture (10 vol% NH3, 30 mL/min) for 30 min. Then pure Ar was introduced again to purge the physically adsorbed NH3 for 30 min. Then the programmed temperature desorption was conducted by increasing the temperature from 80 °C to 800 °C at a ramp rate of 10 °C/min in an Ar flow (30 ml/ min). The desorbed NH3 was detected by a mass spectrometer. The Pyridine IR of the samples were determined on a Nicolet Magna 550 infrared spectrometer. After grinding into below 200 mesh, the samples (20 mg) were mixed with potassium bromide and pressed into a translucent wafer, then connected to the vacuum system. Samples were first evacuated at 400 °C for 3 h under a vacuum of 1.33 × 10−3 Pa, then cooled to room temperature. The sample was then followed to adsorb pure pyridine vapor under static conditions for 30 min. The system was heated up to 150 °C, maintained for 60 min to remove the excess pyridine, then the Py-IR spectra were collected after the temperature reduced to room temperature. The reduction behaviors of the different catalysts were studied by H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2 -TPR) using a Zeton Altamira AMI-200 unit. 50 mg samples were initially flushed with high purity argon (30 ml /min) at 120 °C for 2 h to remove H2O in the catalysts. When the system cooled down to 50 °C, a gas consisting of 5% H2 in Ar was switched on and the temperature was increased to 960 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C /min. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were obtained on an AXIS ULTRA DLD spectrometer equipped with a hemispherical electron energy analyzer. The C 1 s line (284.6 eV) was taken as a reference to calibrate the binding energies (BEs). Al MAS NMR was carried out on a Bruker AVANCE IIITM 600 MHz superconducting nuclear magnetic spectrometer, operating at 156.3 MHz for aluminum using a Chemagnetics 2.5-mm HX MAS probe. Magic angle spinning (54.7°) was carried out at a rotation speed of 12 kHz using a 4 mm diameter zirconium tube. Al(NO3)3 aqueous solution (1.0 M) was used as a standard sample to measure chemical shifts. A Nicolet Magna 750 infrared spectrometer spectrometer supplied with a MCT detector was used to record diffuse reflectance FTIR spectra with a resolution of 8 cm−1 and accumulation of 64. The catalysts were first reduced in situ for 6 h under atmospheric pressure with a stream of high hydrogen (>99.99%) at 400°C, then the system cooled down to 30 °C. High purity CO (>99.99%) was introduced for 30 min. Then the system was purged with argon for 10 min to remove gaseous CO. 2.3 Fischer–Tropsch synthesis catalytic evaluation Fischer–Tropsch synthesis catalytic evaluation was carried out according to our previous study [1]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Morphology and texture of the samples Fig. 1 shows that HS, HAS and HAS10 have a honeycomb-like structures with interconnected macropores. The conventional Beta zeolite presents irregular globular shape, and does not exist macroporous structure. HB obtained by steam-assisted crystallization method still retains the macroporous structure, at the same time a large number of zeolites nanocrystallites can be found inside and outside the macroporoes. As discussed above, the steam-assisted crystallization method can not only form Beta nanocrystallites but also maintain the original good macroporous structure of the meso-macroporous silica. Fig. S1 (a) and (b) shows that the supports HS, HAS, HAS10 and the corresponding catalysts all have typical type IV adsorption isotherms, indicating that the samples have mesopores [27–29]. In addition, CB and HB also have a weak hysteresis loop near 0.5- 0.75, indicating the presence of mesoporous channels, which might originate from the accumulation pores between Beta nanocrystallites. HB, CB and their corresponding catalysts also have the characteristics of type I adsorption isotherms indicating that they have rich microporous structure [30]. Fig. S1 (c) and (d) shows HS, HAS, HAS10 and their corresponding catalysts all have a single centrally distributed mesopore with a pore size about 12.3 nm. For HB, CB and their corresponding catalysts, there is a mesoporous distribution about 4 nm. In summary, according to the SEM and BET results, HS, HAS, HAS10 and their corresponding catalysts have meso-macroporous structures, CB and its corresponding catalyst have micro-mesoporous structures, HB and its corresponding catalyst have micro -meso-macroporous structures. 3.2 Phase structure and morphology of the samples For Co/HS、Co/HAS and Co/HAS10, peaks at 2θ of 31.4°, 36.9°, 44.8°, 59.4°, 65.2° are related to the different crystallite planes of spinel Co3O4 crystallite phase [31]. In addition to the characteristic diffraction peaks of Co3O4, the catalysts Co/CB and Co/HB also have obvious Beta zeolite characteristic diffraction peaks [32]. The average crystallite diameters of Co3O4 calculated by the Scherrer equation are listed in Table 1 [25]. The crystallite size of Co/HAS10 is much smaller than that of Co/HAS and Co/HS due to the excess of Al2O3 in Co/HAS10 and the interaction between Al2O3 and cobalt is much stronger, which increases the dispersion of the active component and reduces the crystallite size [33,34]. Co/CB has the smallest crystallite size, mainly because CB has the largest surface area leading to the active component can be well dispersed. Fig. S2 shows that the cobalt particles of the catalyst Co/HB are much larger than the other four catalysts, which is consistent with the previous XRD results. For the remaining four catalyst, active component is dispersed very uniformly, especially for the catalysts Co/HAS10 and Co/CB, in which the cobaltparticles are small and are uniformly dispersed on the surface of the support. 3.3 Acid site distributions of the supports The absence of the NH3 desorption peak in HS and HAS suggests that there are no any acidic sites indicating a small amount of Al2O3 modification did not significantly change the acidity of the SiO2 support. HAS10 has a weak desorption peak at 130 °C, which is attributed to the desorption of NH3 at weak acid sites. There is a strong NH3 desorption peak for HB at about 130 °C, indicating that it has relatively rich weak acid sites. For CB, two distinct NH3 desorption peaks at about 130 °C and 300 °C are observed indicating that CB simultaneously has a wealth of strong acid sites and weak acid sites [35,36]. As shown in Fig. 2 , the adsorption peaks of the supports at 1550 cm−1 and 1450 cm−1 are assigned to the adsorption of pyridine on Brønsted acid and Lewis acid, respectively [37,38]. HS does not have any absorption peak over the entire temperature range, indicating that it contains no acidic site, which is consistent with the NH3-TPD curve. HAS and HAS10 have strong Lewis acid adsorption peak and weak Brønsted acid adsorption peak. In addition to Lewis acid sites, CB and HB also have abundant Brønsted acid sites, respectively. Brønsted acid is derived from the negative charge caused by Al in the silicon framework, so that a positively charged proton is needed to balance the charge [39]. SiO2 and Al2O3 in HAS and HAS10 are more often surface-contacted, so the amount of Al entering the silicon framework is limited and therefore the Brønsted acid is very weak. HB obtained by the steam-assisted crystallization due to the crystallization process makes more Al into the silicon skeleton, it has abandent Brønsted acid sites. 3.4 Reduction behavior of the samples Fig. 3 shows that the reduction of Co3O4 by hydrogen can be divided into two steps: the first step, Co3O4 is reduced to CoO (200 °C–300 °C); the second step, CoO is reduced to Co (250 °C–500 °C) [40,41]. Co/HS and Co/HAS have similar reduction curves, mainly because they have similar crystallite size. The first and second reduction peaks of Co/HAS10 are completely integrated, and the reduction temperature shifted towards to higher temperature. In addition, there is very a strong reduction peak near 750 °C, which results from a large amount of Al2O3 interacts strongly with the active components. The reduction curve of Co/CB is similar to that of Co/HAS10, but the reduction temperature of the first two steps is relatively lower, and the reduction peak intensity before 400 °C is higher than that of Co/HAS10. In addition, reduction peak about 800 °C is also observed in the reduction curve of Co/CB, and the reduction temperature is slightly higher than that of Co/HAS10, probably because Co2+ or cobalt oxide species were embedded in the microporous channels making it more difficult to be reduced [42]. Co/HB has a higher degree of reduction due to its larger crystallite size, especially for the second reduction step. In addition, a high temperature reduction peak was also observed at about 700 °C, probably because of the strong interaction between the Al species that does not enter the silicon skeleton and the active component. 3.5 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) Fig. 4 shows the Co 2p3/2 peak is located at approximately 780.02–780.81 ev and the peaks around 795.41–796.04 ev are assigned to the highly Co 2p1/2 spin-orbital peaks [43]. The binding energy of the Co 2p3/2 peak can be arranged in the following order: Co/HS < Co/HB < Co/HAS < Co/CB < Co/HAS10, which was due to different metal–support interaction [44]. Co/HS does not contain any Al, so its Co 2p3/2 peak locates in the lowest binding energy position. The highest content of Al in Co/HAS10 has a stronger metal-support interaction, leading to the shift of the Co 2p3/2 peak towards the highest binding energy. 3.6 Al NMR spectroscopy The location of the Al atoms in the supports was investigated by 27 Al NMR spectroscopy. The resonances that appears in the chemical shift range of 0–10 ppm correspond to hexacoordinated non-framework aluminum (AlO6); resonances appearing in the range of 26–35 ppm is attributed to distorted or penta-coordinated aluminum species; resonances in the 50–67 ppm range is tetrahedrally coordinated framework aluminum (AlO4) [45]. Fig. 5 shows that there is a strong peak around 5.7 ppm for HAS and HAS10, indicating that in HAS and HAS10, most of the Al did not enter the silica framework and existed in the form of hexacoordinated non-framework Al. Furthermore, in HB and CB, most of the Al is in the form of tetrahedrally coordinated framework Al, with a major peak at about 53 ppm. And there is also a weak peak near 0 ppm, corresponding to octahedral Al species, which generated from that a small part of the Al atoms are released from the zeolite framework after calcination [46]. In summary, the amorphous SiO2 support can be crystallized into Beta molecular sieve through the method of steam-assisted crystallization, so that more Al atoms enter into the framework of silica. 3.7 In-situ FTIR The peaks at 2170 cm−1 and 2130 cm−1 can be assigned to gaseous carbon monoxide. The peaks at about 1933 cm−1 are attributed to bridged CO adsorbed on cobalt metal and the peaks at about 2000-2100 cm-1 are assigned to CO adsorbed on cobalt particles in a linear geometry [47,48]. Many research groups have reported that bridge-type adsorbed CO is much more active for the FT reaction than linearly adsorbed CO and the latter has little effect on the activity of the catalyst. Fig. 6 shows that the intensity of the bridge-type CO is changed in the order of Co/HAS > Co/CB > Co/HB > Co/HS > Co/HAS10, which indicates that Co/HAS might have the highest catalytic activity [47,48]. Fig. 6 shows that all the catalysts have a peak around 2032 cm−1, belongs to the linear adsorption of CO on the Co° surface. Furthermore, there is a peak about 2058 cm−1 for Co/HS, Co/HAS, Co/HAS10 and Co/CB. To the best of our knowledge, there are currently three explanations for the peaks range 2050-2090 cm−1: (1) CO linearly adsorbed on Coδ + sites, or on Co° in an oxygen-rich environment [49] (2) dicarbonyl species attached to cobalt defect sites [[50] (3) hydrocarbonyl structures [51]. First, a blue shift of the linear-type adsorption of CO on Coδ + sites, or on Co° would be expected if the cobalt sites themselves were electron deficient. Such phenomenon might be found when CO adsorbed on near unreduced cobalt ions or in close contact with the oxide support, where oxygen atoms on the surface of the oxide support would induce a more electropositive character on these adjacent cobalt sites. This assignment is in concordance with that Co/HS, Co/HAS, Co/HAS10 and Co/CB contain smaller crystallite, which is expected to have more Co-support contact surface. Additionally, several groups attribute the peak around 2058 cm−1 to dicarbonyl species attached to cobalt defect sites, which is not agreement with our results as it requires the existence of coupled bands for the symmetric and antisymmetric vibration modes, which is not detected in our spectra [52]. Finally, the possible assignment of the 2058 cm−1 band to a partially hydrogenated Co(H)CO adsorbed species has been reported by many groups. However, in our experiments, Co/HB does not show an absorption peak around 2058 cm−1 under the same experimental conditions, so it is unscientific to assign this peak to the Co(H)CO adsorbed species. Based on the above discussion, the greatest possible of the peaks around 2058 cm−1 for Co/HS, Co/HAS, Co/HAS10 and Co/CB is CO linearly adsorbed on Coδ + sites, or on Co° in an oxygen-rich environment. What’s more, there is an absorption peak around 2085 cm−1 for Co/HB and Co/CB. This peak is most likely to belong to the Co(H)CO adsorbed species. As mentioned above, Brønsted acid is derived from the bridging hydroxyl group between the aluminum and silicon, which is caused by the Al entering the silicon framework leading to a negative charge that requires a positively charged proton H+ to balance the charge. In catalysts Co/HB and Co/CB, adsorption of CO on cobalt in the presence of H+ can lead to species such as Co(H)CO. 3.8 Fischer–Tropsch synthesis reaction behaviour Fischer-Tropsch reaction performance data for the different catalysts are listed in Table 2 . It is worth mentioning that the pellet size of the catalysts is about 830–1700 μm (10–20 mesh). As we have discussed in the introduction, such large pellet catalysts theoretically exist serious internal diffusion limitations. As shown in Table 2, the CO conversion of the catalyst Co/HAS is significantly higher than that of Co/HS. Tsubaki et al. also found that the catalysts modified by Al2O3 showed a significant increase in catalytic activity compared with the original Co/SiO2 catalysts, and the reason was the interaction between Al2O3 and cobalt was much stronger, which was conducive to the dispersion of the active component, increasing the number of active sites [53]. However, in our experiments, Co/HS and Co/HAS have very similar crystallite sizes, dispersion and reduction degree. Therefore, we infer that the reason for the increase of the catalytic activity of Co/HAS is not the increase of component dispersion, but for the bridge-type CO. As we have discussed above, the intensity of the bridge-type CO was changed in the order of Co/HAS > Co/CB > Co/HB > Co/HS > Co/HAS10, which was consistent with the FTS results. The CO conversion of Co/HAS10 decreased obviously compared to Co/HAS and Co/HS. The crystallite size of Co/HAS10 is smaller than Co/HAS and Co/HS, meaning a better dispersion, but it has severe metal-support interactions duo to the excess Al, resulting in the formation of a large number of species that are difficult to be reduced, which can be confirmed by H2-TPR. Co/CB also has a relatively high conversion of CO, probably due to its good dispersion. The activity of Co/HB lies in the middle of the five catalysts, which may depend on the coupling of its of dispersion and reduction [1]. The hydrocarbon selectivity and product distributions of the different catalysts are listed in Table 2 and Fig. S3. As expected, Co/HS catalysts have very low isoparaffins selectivity (6.72%), as well as a relatively broad product distribution with the highest C19 + selectivity. The catalysts Co/HAS and Co/HAS10 modified by Al2O3 shows a small increase in the isoparaffins selectivity, but the proportion is still very low. As indicated by the NH3-TPD and pyridine-IR characterization, HAS and HAS10 do not have enough strong acid sites, so that their ability to cleave long-chain hydrocarbons is very weak, resulting in very weak hydrocracking and isomerization reactions. These results indicate that simple Al2O3 modified silica catalysts cannot significantly enhance the isoparaffins selectivity. As shown in Table 2 and Fig. S3, the isoparaffins selectivity of Co/CB is the highest, due to its abundant acidic sites, but its methane selectivity is also the highest, which is as high as 28.57%, whereas the product after C20+ is almost negligible. As we have explained in the introduction, in large pellet catalysts, diffusion resistances developed very seriously, which is more pronounced for CO than H2 because of the different diffusion coefficients. H2 diffuses much faster than CO, thus the concentration of CO decreases more obviously and leads to that the local H2/CO ratio increases, which often lead to higher methane selectivity and lower heavy hydrocarbon selectivity [18]. As the BET result shows, Co/CB only has a stacking mesopore about 4 nm, which is not enough to reduce internal diffusion limitations. On the other hand, because of diffusion limitations, the FTS product may undergo excessive hydrocracking at the strong acid sites, increasing the selectivity of gaseous hydrocarbons such as C1-C4, which is consistent with the previous reports [54,55]. As above discussion, although conversional Beta zeolite supported catalyst can greatly enhance the isoparaffins selectivity, but due to diffusion restrictions, the selectivity of gaseous hydrocarbons such as methane increased substantially. Based on the FT Synthesis results, the hierarchical Beta zeolite supported catalyst can solve this contradiction. As shown in Table 2, the methane selectivity of Co/HB is a little higher than that of Co/HS, but as low as that of Co/HAS and Co/HAS10, while the C19+ selectivity and olefin selectivity showed the opposite trend. Theoretically, these four large pellet catalysts have serious internal diffusion limitations, but because of the excellent mass transfer and diffusion efficiency of their macropores, the methane selectivity is much lower than that of Co/CB. As shown in Scheme 1 , the syngas can easily reach the active sites without much resistance. In addition, the isoparaffins selectivity of Co/HB is significantly improved compared with that of Co/HS, Co/HAS and Co/HAS10. This is mainly because the amorphous silica support is crystallized by steam-assisted crystallization to form Beta zeolite, resulting in abundant acidic sites. Scheme 1 shows that long-chain hydrocarbons formed on the surface of metallic cobalt would perform secondary reactions at acidic sites those are very close to cobalt to form isoparaffins. As for the sources of the increasing isoparaffins compared with Co/HS, we believe that on the one hand it is from the hydrogenation/isomerization reaction of the produced primary olefins, as the olefin selectivity of Co/HB is lower than that of Co/HS. On the other hand the increasing isoparaffins is from the hydrocracking/isomerization reaction of long-chain hydrocarbons, as the C19+ selectvity of Co/HB is much lower than that of Co/HS. Based on above discussion, the hierarchical Beta zeolite supported catalyst can not only solve the problem of internal diffusion limitations in large pellet catalysts, but also improve the isoparaffins selectivity. There has been a lot of controversy over the recognition of active centers for catalytic isomerization. There are groups reported that Brønsted acid is conducive to promoting the formation of isoparaffins, Lewis acid is favor for hydrocracking; but others reported the opposite results [56,57]. In addition, Meijiers et al have demonstrated that the isomerization reaction is carried out under the synergistic effect of the two kind acids [58]. As the FT synthesis result shows, the isoparaffins selectivity of Co/HB and Co/CB is much higher than that of Co/HAS and Co/HAS10. HB and CB have abundant Brønsted acid sites and Lewis acid sites based on pyridine-IR results. But for HAS and HAS10, the acid type is mainly Lewis acid, while the Brønsted acid is minimal. From this, we infer that the active center of the isomerization reaction may be Brønsted acid or isomerization reaction only carry out with the synergistic effect of Brønsted acid and Lewis acid. 4 Conclusions In this article, we successfully prepared micro-meso-macroporous Beta zeolite by the method of steam-assisted crystallization and applied to cobalt Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Co/HS, Co /HAS and Co/HAS10 have very low isoparaffins selectivity due to the lack of sufficiently acidic sites. The conventional zeolite supported catalyst can greatly improve the isoparaffins selectivity, but because of the microporous structure, which is not conducive to mass transfer and diffusion, resulting in very high methane selectivity. The hierarchical micro-meso-macroporous Beta zeolite (HB) supported catalyst, on the one hand has a wealth of acidic sites, increasing the selectivity of isoparaffins; on the other hand has a good macroporous structure, which is favour for reducing the internal diffusion limitations, reducing the methane selectivity. The high selectivity of isoparaffins combined with relatively low methane selectivity will make the hierarchical Beta zeolite supported cobalt catalyst very promising for cobalt Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. In this article we use large pellet catalysts during the evaluation, which is very close to the conditions of industrial production, at which the hierarchical Beta zeolite supported cobalt catalyst can not only reduce the internal diffusion limitations but also improve the selectivity of cobalt-based catalyst.

        "dc:description": "A hierarchical micro-meso-macroporous Beta zeolite (HB) was developed by a steam-assisted crystallization method and was employed for cobalt Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Meso-macroporous silica (HS), alumina modified meso-macroporous silica (HAS) and conventional Beta zeolite (CB) were used for comparison. Structural characterization indicated that the as-synthesized HB exhibited nanosized Beta zeolite crystallites and a hierarchical micro-meso-macroporous structure. The HB supported catalyst showed very high isoparaffins selectivity because of the isomerization reaction at the strong acidic sites of the Beta zeolite, while due to its good macroporous structure, which is in favor of reducing the internal diffusion limitations, the methane selectivity was kept as low as HAS supported catalysts. In this paper, we use large particle catalysts for evaluation, which are very close to industrial condition. And the conclusions obtained may be very important for the design of new Fischer-Tropsch catalysts.",
