Uniform free standing TiO2 nanostructure with different shapes was extensively prepared by a template assisted hydrothermal method by controlling the pH and using Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4 as the titanium source. {101} and {200} planes of TiO2 were found to be the preferentially exposed active crystal planes for both nanospheres and nanostrips TiO2. The newly synthesised TiO2 materials were found to be very efficient for the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants in industrial wastewater. Graphical abstract Keywords Self-assembly Morphology controlled synthesis TiO2 nanostructure Photocatalysis Wastewater treatment 1 Introduction Controlling size and shape of the nanostructured material is crucial to tune physiochemical properties of those materials [1]. Specifically, 3D nanostructures with a desired expose crystal planes to a large extent may show enhancement in catalytic properties. Apart from graphene related materials [2], substantial research efforts have been made to synthesise 3D nanocrystals of various geometry, including metal oxides and supported metal oxides [3]. Nanostructured TiO2 has attracted considerable interest not only as catalyst materials, but also in other applications like photo catalyst, solar cell applications, intercalated electrode for Li-ion batteries and supercapacitor [3–4]. Over the past decade, a large number of synthesis methods have been applied to fabricate TiO2 nanoarchitectures, using sol–gel, template assisted hydrothermal methods etc. [5]. Although there are several methods for the preparation of TiO2 nanoclusters, but a simple, reliable preparation method, which is highly reproducible and can be prepared in large scale is still a challenge for the researches. Most of the reports for the preparation of nanostructured TiO2, involves the use of strong inorganic acid such as HF, HCl etc. [6]. The use of alkali for the same has also been well exploited and demonstrated by Y. Lan et al. [7] Nevertheless, all the methods for synthesising nanosized TiO2; substantial amount of acids or bases have been used and the question of reproducibility has not been highlighted in most of the cases. Photocatalytic decomposition of organic pollutants present in wastewater is one of the most environmentally friendly modern pollution-treatment method. It has attracted tremendous attention over the last decades as it offers the direct use of UV or visible light for environmental applications [8]. Among the potential semiconductor photocatalyst, TiO2 is the most explored photocatalyst; as it is nontoxic, stable under radiation, easily available with cheaper price and has a high electron mobility, which is essential for enhanced photocatalysis. In general, the semiconductors used as photocatalyst implicate photogenerated electrons followed by holes migrating to the surface [9]. For the photocatalytic processes on TiO2 catalyst, it is known that the photogenerated holes present are responsible to oxidize the water adsorbed on the TiO2 surface to create hydroxyl radicals as strong oxidizing agents. These redox sources then react with adsorbed pollutant molecule, leading to the degradation of pollutants. However, TiO2 based photocatalysts face the problem of the rapid recombination of charge carriers — the photo-generated electrons (e−) and the holes (h+), which leads to low quantum efficiency and recyclability of the material. The photocatalytic efficiency can be improved by preventing the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole [10]. Herein, we report a simple approach for the preparation of three dimensional (3D) shape selective TiO2 nanoarchitecture material using a simple preparation method by controlling the pH with the use of an organosilane template. This newly designed material has been accessed for photocatalytic application in environmental decontamination of waste water pollutants by using standard UV irradiation. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Formation mechanism of TiO2 nanoarchitecture To understand the formation mechanism, material was collected with predetermined intervals during the crystallization process and we found that formation of TiO2 nanocatalysts of different sizes and shapes was a combination of Ostwald ripening [11] and self-assembly process. A schematic description of the self-assembly of TiO2 nanostructure is shown in Scheme 1 . Initially, the hydrolysis of titanium isopropoxide took place in ethanol medium similar to that reported by E. Hosono et al. [12] and more recently by Wang et al. [13] in aqueous medium. As a result, numerous tiny titanium hydroxide nuclei appeared in the presence of octadecyldimethyl [3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl] ammonium chloride. The freshly grown titanium hydroxide nuclei were aggregated to minimise their surface area through Ostwald ripening and the shape formation has been taken place. It is assumed that the shape formation is completely governed by the pH of the solution in our case. Octadecyldimethyl [3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl] ammonium chloride forms ionic head in the solution and a co-operative self-assembly with tiny titanium hydroxide nuclei. The template then interacts with titanium hydroxide aggregates (which have been strongly assisted by pH) and forms distorted small crystallites with different shapes depending on the pH of the medium as shown in Figs. S1 and S2. It is a well established phenomenon that the curvature of an ionic micelle can be turned from spherical to rod like micelle by adding certain additive [3] during the preparation, the addition of Na+ ions acts as an additive and transforms ionic micelles from spherical shape to rod like shape. With prolonged time, these crystalline self-assembly nuclei grow into 3D nanostrips or spherical titanates based on their inner crystallographic orientation [14]. 2.2 Physiochemical characterization The TiO2 nanostructures obtained after hydrothermal treatment of titanium isopropoxide and octadecyldimethyl [3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl] ammonium chloride were viewed by SEM images as shown in Figs. 1A–D and S1, (in the Supporting Information). The growth of TiO2 nanoparticles was triggered by adding 1(M) solution of sodium hydroxide. The shapes of the TiO2 nanostructures are spherical; oval and nanostrips when the pH was 4, 5 and 6 respectively and this was done by the addition of different concentration of Na+ (Figs. 1 and S2, in the Supporting Information). In order to verify the formation mechanism of the TiO2 nanostructures, samples were collected and the SEM images were taken at different stages of the crystallization process and shown in Fig. 2A–C. During the monitoring process no evidence of any geometrical shape formation have been traced before hydrothermal treatment; and the morphology changes were noticed at different stages of the nucleation process. After 6h of hydrothermal treatment, 3D spherical TiO2 consists of small nanotubes (Fig. 2A) was visualized. Those nanotubes were more prominent between 12h to 18h of autothermal treatment (Fig. 2B–C), when pH was below 6 those intermediate structures were transformed to spherical and oval titanates; whereas at higher pH (≥6) the nanotubes decoiled to form nanostrips. The corresponding TEM images shown in Fig. 2D–F; at low pH those small nanotubes form larger octahedral particle constituents of nanospheres. However, the relatively large polycrystalline particle of the free standing nanostrips in the HRTEM image of Fig. 2E–F shows exposed (200) planes and (101) planes of fcc-structured TiO2. We reproduced the synthesis method and found similar morphology pattern of TiO2 in each synthesis (as shown in Figure S3, in Supporting Information). The XRD patterns (Fig. 3a) show that the shape selective TiO2 was purely in anatase form, while coming from nanospheres to free standing nanostrips the samples become more amorphous in nature. The BET surface area of TiO2 varies with the shape of the formed particles. The surface area of the spherical TiO2 nanoparticles synthesised at pH4 was 29.3m2g−1 whereas, for nanostrips (synthesised at pH7) the surface area was 52.6m2g−1. Ti 2p XPS spectra of the as-prepared TiO2 is shown in Fig. 3b. The peak corresponding to Ti 2p appears at binding energy (BE) 458.4eV along with it's shake up lines at BE 464.4eV and is recognized for TiO2 in both strips and spherical particles. No other peaks except Ti and O was found in the XPS analysis, which confirms the high purity of the material. Fig. 3c shows Raman spectra of the TiO2 nanostrips calcined at 750°C. The Raman bands at 144, 197, 398, 514 and 519 (superimposed with 514cm−1 band) and 639cm−1 were the bands for anatase phase of TiO2. These typical Raman bands attributed to the six Raman active modes of anatase TiO2 of symmetries Eg, Eg, B1g, A1g, B1g and Eg stretching modes, respectively[15]. The thermal stability of the prepared TiO2 nanostrips was examined by thermogravimetric analysis and shown in Fig. S4. There is not much weight loss on TGA curve (4% only); this indicates that no decomposition of anatase TiO2 has occurred. No phase change (it was believe that anatase phase was transferred to rutile phase between 550 to 600°C) [16] was observed between the temperature range of 400 to 800°C in accordance with the DTA pattern as shown in Fig. S4a (in the Supporting Information). These observations confirm the high surface thermal stability of the as prepared TiO2 nanostrips. We believe that, the organo alkyl silane is not completely removed during the post synthesis procedure and this small amount of silica restricts the phase transformation during the calcination; as observed by TGA analysis. The same has been reported by Hirano et al. [17], where they found that TiO2/SiO2 composite; the anatase-to-rutile phase transformation was retarded to maintain the anatase-type structure up to 1300°C with no trace of rutile phase. We have treated the as prepared TiO2 nanowire with HF for the complete removal of silica and did the calcination at two different temperatures (at 550 and 750°C). The result shows that in 550°C calcined sample it was completely anatase while at 750°C (Fig. S5, in the supporting information) rutile-type (rutile–anatase mixed) TiO2 was observed. The TGA analysis of the HF treated sample is shown in Fig. S4b; where the exothermic peak at 709°C was attributed to the latent heat for the phase transformation from metastable anatase TiO2 to stable rutile phase. Fig. 3d shows the normalized UV–Vis absorption spectra of different TiO2 nanoparticle along with the commercially available TiO2 (P25). The absence of any additional peak of adsorption was also notified for the prepared TiO2. The optical band gap of morphology controlled TiO2 photocatalyst was calculated by following relational expression proposed by Davis, and Mott[18]. αhν 1 / n = C hν − E g where α is adsorption coefficient, h is Plank constant, ν is the frequency of light, C is the proportionality constant, E g is the band gap energy and n =1/2 for direct band gap semiconductor and n =2 for indirect band gap semiconductor. TiO2 regarded as indirect band gap semiconductor (n =2) and α can be calculated by α = − 1 / t × A × log e where A is the absorption and t is the thickness of photocatalyst film. The case of synthesised TiO2 plots of (αhν)2 vs hν (eV) for the indirect transitions are presented in Fig. 3d where the value of the band gap (E g ) was obtained by extrapolating the linear part of the graphics to the axis of the abscissa. From the Tauc's plot the calculated band gap of 3.3eV was observed for oval TiO2, 3.1eV for TiO2 nanostrips and 3.0eV for P25 were observed. The band gap energies of TiO2 of oval morphology found to be larger than the known value of anatase TiO2 and that for nanostrips were in-between to the band gap energy of rutile and anatase TiO2 [19]. The increased band gap energies for oval TiO2 can be attributed to the partly amorphous-crystalline nature of the sample and the binding energy values were in agreement with the work of Welte et al. [20]. However, the slight decrease (0.1eV) in band gap shiftsthe conduction band edge position slightly downward and valence band edge position slightly upward[21]. We assumed that the electron and holes produced in TiO2 nanostrips have lower negative and positive potential and that definitely enhance the reduction potential of the photo-generated electrons for TiO2 nanostrips. Therefore, the downswing in conduction band position enhanced the photocatalytic activity for the TiO2 catalyst compared to commercial P25. 2.3 Catalytic activity Photocatalytic degradation of various organic dyes present in wastewater of textile industries in the presence of TiO2 nanostrips (synthesised at pH7) under UV radiation was performed and illustrated in Fig. 4a–d. All the organic dyes exhibit typically large absorption of absorptive wavelength of 365nm or higher and we have used this absorption band to monitor the photo-degradation of organic dyes present in dye wastewater. It was clearly observed that all the dyes degrade >90% within 40min time (Table 1 ). 20% methyl orange was degraded within 10min (red line) of the reaction (Fig. 4a). This data clearly indicated the efficacy of our material and the function of catalytically active exposed (200) and (101) phases of anatase TiO2 with a wide band gap (∼3.2eV) that has been used for environmental photocatalysis. Furthermore, the rate of photo-degradation took a 41/2 fold increase after 20min (blue line) and encountered >90% degradation of methyl orange and it took only 30min (pink line) to complete the degradation of methyl orange. The photocatalytic efficiency for the decomposition of methyl orange has been tested with TiO2 of different morphologies, and the results were shown in Table S1. It must be emphasized that the morphology of the material has exhibited an enhancement of photocatalytic activity. The degradation efficiency reaches to 95.7% (entry 3) for our TiO2 nanostrips, whereas TiO2 of oval (2D) shape encountered 93.6% (entry 2) followed by 92.1% degradation efficiency of spherical TiO2 (entry 1). We believe, that higher surface area enhances (52.6m2g−1 for TiO2 nanostrips compare to 29.3m2g−1 for oval TiO2 nanostructure) dye absorption over TiO2 surface which further improves photon harvesting capability, and causes better photocatalytic activity for TiO2 nanostrips. For comparison, we have tested the degradation efficiency of methyl orange over commercial P25 (Sigma Aldrich, USA), but only 25% degradation efficiency was observed after 30min. In addition, it was found that parent titanate precursor shows no photocatalytic activity, which may be attributed to the higher band gap (≥3.3) energy of our titanate samples relative to that of titania nanostrips (3.1) and hence a higher energy of irradiation (than the 365nm light used in this study) is needed for optimal photocatalytic activation. The oval titania which has a band gap of 3.3 also experienced less photocatalytic efficiency compared to titania nanostrips. Although P25 has a small band gap of 3.0 but the morphology-driven energy shift and broadening of the absorption spectrum of anatase TiO2 nanostrips, with respect to that of anatase TiO2 nanoparticles and P25, can account for the increased photoactivity[22]. We have also compared our results with the literature data (in Table S1) and found that our prepared TiO2 shows almost three fold increase in degradation efficiency [23–24]. We believe that photodegradation behaviour of the TiO2 nanostructure depends on the surface structure of the prepared TiO2. The similar observation was noticed by Huang et al. [25] and according to them nanotube array exhibits enhance photocurrent, which is responsible for the enhancement in photocatalytic activity. Hence, the band property of the photocurrent enhancement was better in our case to show better photodegradation activity. We compare our result with the reported result in the literature [25]. Wang et al. reported the preparation Iron(III) doped TiO2 catalyst where they found almost ~99.9% degradation of methyl orange; however 4 fold extra time was necessary to acquire this degradation efficiency compared to our results [26]. Our catalytic efficiency is also superior, compare to the N-doped TiO2 catalyst reported by Bu et al. [23], Table S1. Methyl purple also showed almost 60.2% degradation efficiency within 30min under UV irradiation (Fig. 4b). The efficiency reached ~95% after 40min time-on-steam. The absorption band for methyl red was found at 427nm and a change in the optical absorption within 15min was observed (Fig. 4c) and encountered almost 60.6% degradation efficiency. Further increase in irradiation time, the degradation efficiency reaches 94.2% after 30min. Rhodamine 6G showed adsorption band centred at 526nm and a linear decrease of optical density was observed with prolonged irradiation time (as shown in Fig. 4d). The TiO2 nanostrips encountered 90.4% degradation efficiency after 30min of UV irradiation. The photodegradation of chloro-benzene was carried out at 365nm UV irradiation and the results are summarized in Fig. S6 (in the supporting information). 76.2% degradation efficiency of chloro-benzene was observed after 30min of UV irradiation and complete degradation of the solution was achieved after 180min. 3 Conclusions In summary, we have demonstrated a simple approach for the preparation of controlled TiO2 nanostructures with different shape by hydrothermal method using octadecyldimethyl [3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl] ammonium chloride and 1M NaOH. The size and shape of nanoparticles can be tuned by controlling the pH of the solution by 1M NaOH. The catalytic performance of the size and shape controlled TiO2 was quantitatively evaluated in the photocatalytic dye degradation present in waste water. The TiO2 nanostrips were found to exhibit the highest catalytic activity and showed >90% degradation efficacy for the investigated dyes. We are currently expanding our approach to the preparation of other noble metals and oxide supports. Our method for continuous production of easy-to-tailor shape controlled TiO2 will be useful for discovering low-cost, absolutely 100% reproducible and highly efficient catalysts for industrially important chemical reactions.
