Cction electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) have attracted increasing recent years, due to the potential for highly efficient ration from clean energy sources, without evolution of ong time, the Pt catalysts used in both electrodes were be indispensable for the electrochemical reactions in ever, the limited availability and high price of Pt cat- ajor barriers to commercialization. Consequently, the nt of alternative catalysts is essential. In the past few nificant advances have been made in the preparation ance of Pt-free catalysts for PEFC cathodes, and the of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in such mate- come clearer [1â€“6]. , several groups have reported carbon-based catalysts RR activity. Dodelet et al. prepared catalysts by wet on of iron (II) acetate into carbon black, followed by heat nder flowing NH 3 [7]. They suggested that the active t of Fe cations coordinated to pyridinic N, in the inter- phitic sheets. Popov et al. prepared nitrogen-modified posite catalysts, using pyrolysis of a Coâ€“Feâ€“N chelate pported on carbon black [8,9]. Also, Ozaki et al. [10], l. [11] and Wu et al. [12] prepared catalysts starting ding author. Tel.: +81 3 5734 2433; fax: +81 3 5734 2875. ress: mkakimot@o.cc.titech.ac.jp (M.-a. Kakimoto). from a mixture of resins and Fe or Co phthalocyanine, followed by pyrolysis at 600â€“1000 â—¦ C. Both Popovâ€™s and Ozakiâ€™s groups applied acid-washing treatment to remove metal on the catalyst surface, but the same level of ORR activity as the un-washed catalysts was still observed, suggesting that the ORR active site does not require Fe-coordination. Although surface metal was removed after pyrolysis, it was implied that it is essential at the preparation stage, in order to obtain high ORR activity. Conversely, there are several reports about ORR catalysts prepared from metal-free, N- containing polymers [13â€“15]. Recently, the ORR active site was proposed to be on C atoms neighboring graphite-like N atoms along the zigzag edges of graphite layers, according to computational studies by Terakura et al. [16], and by X-ray absorption analy- sis reported by Oshima et al. [17]. Additionally, Popov et al. have suggested that pyridinic and graphite-like N act as the active site for ORR [9]. All proposed mechanisms for carbon-based catalysts maintain that the N atom plays an important role for ORR. Since aromatic polymers are well known precursors of graphitic mate- rials, carbon-based catalysts prepared from nitrogen-containing aromatic polymers with well-defined chemical structures could help clarify the correlation between the starting materials and the pyrolyzed samples. Recently, we reported the ORR activity of carbon-based catalysts prepared by metal-free pyrolysis of polyimides (PI), polyamides (PA), and azoles (Az). We investigated the relation between the N content in the starting polymer and the ORR activity of the pyrolyzed catalysts.
