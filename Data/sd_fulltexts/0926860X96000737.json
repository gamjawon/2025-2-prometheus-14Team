Dai a, Randall H. Petty a, Conrad W. Ingram b, R. Szostak b,, a Texaco R&D Port Authur, 4545 Savanah Avenue, Port Authur, TX 77641 USA b Department of Chemistry, Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, GA 300083, USA Abstract Substitution of transition metals for either aluminum and/or phosphorus in the AIPO4-11 framework is found to afford novel heterogeneous catalysts for liquid phase hydroxylation of phenol with hydrogen peroxide. A1PO4-11 is more active than SAPO-II and MgAPO-II for phenol conversion to hydroquinone. Substitution of transition metal cations, such as Fe, Co and Mn significantly improves the conversion of phenol. The activity follows the order of FeAPO-11 > CoAPO-11 > FeMnAPO-11 > MnAPO-11 > > A1PO4-11. FeAPO-11, FeMnAPO-I1 and CoAPO-11 give similar product selectivities of about 1:1 hydroquinone (HQ) to catechol (CT) whereas MnAPO-11 favors the production of catechol. FeAPO-11 show comparable performance to TS-1 (titanium silicate with MFI topology) for phenol conversion, with TS-1 giving higher selectivities toward hydroquinone. Medium pore size CoAPO- 11 was more active than larger pore CoAPO-50, -36 and -5. The external surfaces of the catalysts play a significant role in these oxidation reactions.

Introduction In the continual effort to transform fine chemical production to more environ- mentally benign technologies, metal-containing aluminophosphate molecular sieves offers tremendous potential as catalysts for heterogeneous oxidation in the production of these chemicals. This follows from the significant advancement in * Corresponding author. 0926-860X/96/$15.00 Copyright 1996 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Dai et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 143 (1996) lOl-llO the field of heterogeneous catalysis by molecular sieves, resulting from the synthesis of the titanium-containing silicate (TS-1) by Enichem researchers [1-3]. This catalyst has proven to be very effective in a wide range of catalytic oxidation reactions of industrial importance, such as, epoxidation of alkenes, oxidation of alcohols, and hydrocarbons, caprolactam synthesis and hydroxyl- ation of aromatics. The success of TS- 1 established the precedence for other redox metal-contain- ing molecular sieves to be used in such heterogeneous catalytic reactions. One such group of materials is the metal substituted aluminophosphates (MeAPOs) [4]. These materials were synthesized following their earlier counterparts, the pure aluminophosphates (A1PO4) [5]. They are formed from the isomorphous substitution of aluminum for di- or trivalent metals in the framework of aluminophosphate molecular sieves. Substitution of metal cations with redox properties such as Fe, Co and Mn may be expected to afford novel heteroge- neous catalysts for liquid phase oxidation reactions. The framework phosphorus in A1POas can also be substituted with vanadium [6-9], another redox metal, to give vanadium-containing molecular sieves (VAPOs). Though tremendous progress has been made in their preparation, and though they have demonstrated potential in oxidation reactions, so far little advancement has been made in this regard. Sheldon and co-workers found that CoAPO-11 and CoAPO-5 are both effective, stable, and recyclable solid catalysts in the facile oxidation (with 02) of p-cresol to p-hydroxybenzaldehyde at 50, with conversion and selectivity both reaching 90% [10,11]. The superior performance of the catalysts over homogenous cobalt salt was attributed to the fact that unlike the cobalt salt, CoAPO cannot form ix-hydroxo bridged cobalt dimers. In other reports, Lin et al. [12] showed CoAPO-5 to be an active and moderate catalyst for the auto-oxidation of cyclohexane in acetic acid. At 30-40% conversion, selectivity to adipic acid was up to 45%. The oxidation of saturated hydrocarbons involving CoAPO molecular sieves has also been demonstrated by Kraushaar-Czarnetzki et al. [13]. The redox properties of the catalyst were related to the ability of the framework Co to change between the Co(II) and Co(liD oxidation states. Sheldon and co-workers also investigated the catalytic behavior of a variety of redox MeAPOs in liquid phase oxidations with 02 and tetrabutylhydroperox- ide (TBHP), examples of which include: the oxidation of alkanes, alkylaromatic, alcohols and the epoxidation or oxidative cleavage of olefins with TBHP. They reported for example that CAPO-5 is an excellent, recyclable, solid catalyst for the oxidation of secondary alcohols to the corresponding ketones using TBHP or 02 as the oxidant [14]. Chen et al. reported that CAPO-5 was an active, stable and selective catalyst in the decomposition of cyclohexyl hydroperoxide towards cyclohexanone, benzylic oxidations and the (auto)-oxidation of secondary alco- hols with TBHP and 02 [15,16]. VAPO-5 and VAPO-I1 were both demon- strated by other researchers to catalyze oxidations, such as epoxidation of allylic P.-S.E. Dai et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 143 (1996) 101-110 103 alcohols analogous to homogenous vanadium salts [8,9,17] and benzylic oxida- tions with TBHP and oxygen [8,9]. In this paper we investigate the catalytic activities of MeAPO-11 containing Fe, Co, Mn for the hydroxylation of phenol with hydrogen peroxide. The effects of molecular sieve structures including CoAPO-11, CoAPO-36 and CoAPO-50 on the phenol conversion reaction, were also considered. 2. Experimental 2.1. Synthesis of MeAPOs Synthetic procedures were according to those of Flanigen and co-workers [4]. Phosphoric acid (Fisher, 85%) was the source of phosphorus. Metal acetates (Fisher) were sources of Co, Mn and Mg, while ferric sulfate (Aldrich) was source of Fe. Aluminum source was either aluminum isopropoxide (Aldrich) or Catapal B (Vista Chemical Co.) and the source of silicon was Ludox HS 40 (Dupont). Organic amines (R) were obtained form Aldrich. These were as follows: diethylethanolamine for MgAPO-5 and CoAPO-5, di-n-propylamine for MgAPO-11 and CoAPO-50, diisopropylamine for CoAPO-11 and FeAPO-11, and tripropylamine for CoAPO-36. With the exception of A1PO4-11, SAPO-11 and FeAPO-11, the general molar composition of the reaction mixtures was: R = 1.0; MeO = 0.167; A1203 = 0.917; P205 = 1.0; AcOH = 0.33; C3H7OH = 5.5; H20 = 50. For FeAPO-11, the iron content of the reaction mixture was varied according to Table 4. The synthesis mixtures were heated in Teflon-lined autoclaves at temperature between 150 and 200 and times between 24 h and 168 h, following which, the autoclaves were water quenched, the solid product filtered, washed with distilled water and dried in air overnight. All samples were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and chemical analysis by ICP or atomic absorption spectroscopy to monitor crystallinity, particle size, crystal morphology and chemical composi- tion. XRD patterns, which were recorded on a Philips X'PERT Diffractometer using Cu k~ radiation and nickel filters, showed each sample to be of high crystallinity. A sample of TS-1 was obtained from Uetikon, (Switzerland). 2.2. Catalytic testing Hydroxylation reactions were performed in a stirred 250 ml round-bottom flask fitted with a water cooled condenser. Reactions were done under atmo- spheric pressure, and temperatures were between ambient and 180. Typically, 0.2 g of molecular sieve powder, 45 ml of water, 2 g of phenol (Aldrich) and 2 g of hydrogen peroxide (30%, Fisher) was added to the reaction flask. The reaction was heated to the desired temperature and the progress of the reaction 104 P.-S.E. Dai et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 143 (1996) 101-110 was monitored as a function of time. Reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography. 3. Results and discussion The performances of A1PO-1 ls with a range of compositions are compared for the catalytic conversion of phenol (Table 1). The order of catalytic activity, expressed in terms of phenol conversion is as follows: FeAPO-11 >> A1PO4-11 > MgAPO- 11 = SAPO- 11. The superior performance of FeAPO- 11 can be attributed to the presence of the transition metal in the catalyst. It is known that strong Br~nsted acidity catalyzes the decomposition of peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide and t-butyl peroxide [18]. Both MgAPO-11 and SAPO-11 are characterized by having greater total acidity than FeAPO-11 and A1PO4-11. Competing hydrogen peroxide decomposition reactions catalyzed by the high concentration of BriSnsted acidities in both SAPO-11 and MgAPO-11 resulted in a lower conversion compared to A1PO4-11 and FeAPO-11. The role of catalyst acidity in oxidation reactions has been previously highlighted in the use of Ti(IV) silicates containing AI(III) or Fe(III) in the epoxidation of propylene [3]. The higher acidity associated with the trivalent ions resulted in a much lower conversion to the epoxide, compared with the pure Ti-silicate (TS-1). The samples show approximately 1:1 selectivity for hydroquinone:catechol, with the exception of MgAPO-11 which show a low selectivity for hydroquinone forma- tion. The performance of FeAPO-11 with reaction time during the conversion of phenol is compared for both the as-synthesized (Fig. 1A) and calcined (Fig. 1B) forms of the catalyst. The catalytic activity was similar in both cases and reached a constant as early as half an hour reaction time. The hydroquinone selectivity also remained constant at approximately 1:1 hydroquinone:catechol. The halt in phenol conversion may result from deactivation of the catalyst or a depletion of hydrogen peroxide from the reaction mixture (vide infra).

This comparable activity demonstrated by the as-synthesized catalyst strongly suggests that active sites on the external surfaces of the catalysts play a significant role in the phenol conversion reaction. The high activity demonstrated by FeAPO-11 prompted further investigation of other transition metal-containing MeAPO-11s. As with the case of Fe, substitution of framework aluminum by other transition metal cations, such as Mn and Co appears to significantly improve the conversion of phenol. Fig. 2 shows the conversion of phenol as a function of time for MnAPO-11. The activity was similar for both the as-synthesized (Fig. 2A) and calcined (Fig. 2B) catalyst, but lower than that of FeAPO-11. Here again the significance of active external surface species in the catalysis process is inferred. A high hydroquinone selectivity was observed using the calcined MnAPO-11 catalyst.

MeAPO-11 catalyst system containing both Fe and Mn was also evaluated for phenol conversion. The activity was found to be similar for both the as-synthesized (Fig. 3A) and calcined (Fig. 3B) samples. Furthermore the activity falls between those cata- lysts containing the respective single transition metal cations. The overall activity of calcined materials followed the order of FeAPO- 11 > FeMnAPO- 11 > MnAPO- 11. A summary of the activities of the as-synthesized transition metal containing MeAPO-1 Is (including CoAPO-11) is given along with that of TS-1 in Table 2. In this case it was observed that CoAPO-1 1 gave higher activity than FeM- nAPO-11. Overall activities of the MeAPO-11 s were comparable to TS-1, but TS-1 giving a higher hydroquinone selectivity. The activities observed for both as-synthesized and calcined MeAPOs could not be rationalized simply on the basis of the reduction potential of the transition metals.

With regards to product selectivity, in general FeAPO-11, FeMnAPO-11 and CoAPO-11 give similar product selectivities of about 1:1 of hydroquinone:catechol, whereas MnAPO-11 favor the production of catechol. The effects of reaction conditions were carried out for FeAPO-11. Fig. 4 shows the effect of temperature on the conversion of phenol. At 5 h, the temperature had no significant influence on the catalytic activity and hydro- quinone selectivity (23% and 48% respectively) as the temperature was in- creased from 40 to 80. However, at a shorter reaction time (1 h) an increase of catalytic activity with increasing temperature was observed. Phenol conver- sion increased from 0% at 40 to 20% at 60 after which it remained constant. Phenol conversion was therefore effective at the lower temperature, but as is expected, at a much slower reaction rate. The effect of hydrogen peroxide concentration was investigated. The activity, yield (conversion selectivity) and selectivity all show strong dependence on the hydrogen peroxide concentration (Fig. 5). Phenol conversion and yield of hydroquinone increased significantly as the H 202 :phenol mol ratio was increased from 0.5 to 5.5. The results suggest that the phenol conversion reaction progressed directly to the main products, hydroquinone and catechol with little or no side products. Like in most cases in this study, an increase in conversion is accompanied by an increased selectivity towards catechol, and corresponding decreased selectivity for hydroquinone. This may be due to secondary isomerization of hydroquinone to catechol at higher conversion levels. The effect of AI:Fe ratio of FeAPO-11 is shown in Table 3. For samples A to C, an increase in phenol conversion and a decrease in hydroquinone selectivity were observed for catalyst of different AI:Fe ratios as the reaction time was 108 P.-S.E.

For large changes in the AI:Fe ratio of the catalyst however, no significant effect on the catalytic activity was observed. With a greater than 10-fold increase in the amount of iron in the FeAPO-11 synthesis mixture between sample C and A, only a small enhancement in phenol conver- sion was obtained, while the selectivity to hydroquinone remained unchanged. On the contrary, sample D with twice as much Fe as sample C, showed a dramatic increase in phenol conversion and a lower hydroquinone selectivity.

Attempts were also made to study the influence of the pore size of the molecular sieves. The molecular sieves chosen for this study were CoAPOs of structure type -11, -36, -50 and -5. Their performances in the conversion of phenol are listed in Table 4. CoAPO-11 was tested only in its as-synthesized form, as it has been shown above that the as-synthesized and calcined MeAPO- 11 s both gave comparable catalytic performances. The order of activity observed was CoAPO-11 >> CoAPO-50 > CoAPO-36 = CoAPO-5. The much higher activity for CoAPO- 11 is not readily explained by a pore size effect. CoAPO- 11 is a medium pore material with a free pore diameter of 6.3 ,~ 3.9 A while the later three materials, CoAPO-50, -36 and -5 areolarge pore MeAPOs with free pore diameters of 6.1 ,~, 6.5 A 7.5 ,~ and 7.3 A respectively [19]. The slower rate of diffusion of the reactants in the smaller pores of CoAPO-11, due to reactant selectivity, is more likely than in the larger pore materials. This would result in a lower percentage conversion of phenol. Furthermore, the as-synthe- sized CoAPO- 11 with little or no pore access, (resulting from entrapment of the organic amine) should also prevent reactants from reaching active sites in the internal pores of the molecular sieves. This superior performance of CoAPO- 11 strongly suggests that active sites on the external surfaces of the catalysts play a significant role in the phenol conversion reaction. CoAPO-36 and -50 both showed high selectivity for hydroquinone formation at low conversion. It is therefore concluded that medium pore MeAPO-1 l s are the most active catalysts in the conversion of phenol and that the external surfaces of the catalysts also play a significant role in the process. The lower activities observed for the large pore CoAPOs may be a result of deactivation due to large organic species formed in the large pore materials. Clearly, further studies are needed to be elucidate the effect of pore structure on their catalytic performances. 4. Conclusion MeAPOs have demonstrated significant catalytic activities for the liquid phase hydroxylation of phenol with hydrogen peroxide. Substitution of divalent 110 P.-S.E. Dai et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 143 (1996) 101-110 and trivalent metal cations, such as Fe, Co, and Mn significantly improve the levels of conversion. The external surface of these catalysts played a significant role in their catalytic activity. FeAPO-11 showed comparable performance to TS-1. The activity depends upon AI:Fe ratio and level of acidity of the molecular sieves. Medium pore MeAPOs are more active than their larger pore counterparts.

Substitution of transition metals for either aluminum and/or phosphorus in the AIPO4-11 framework is found to afford novel heterogeneous catalysts for liquid phase hydroxylation of phenol with hydrogen peroxide. AlPO4-11 is more active than SAPO-11 and MgAPO-11 for phenol conversion to hydroquinone. Substitution of transition metal cations, such as Fe, Co and Mn significantly improves the conversion of phenol. The activity follows the order of FeAPO-11 > CoAPO-11 > FeMnAPO-11 > MnAPO-11 ≫ AlPO4-11. FeAPO-11, FeMnAPO-11 and CoAPO-11 give similar product selectivities of about 1:1 hydroquinone (HQ) to catechol (CT) whereas MnAPO-11 favors the production of catechol. FeAPO-11 show comparable performance to TS-1 (titanium silicate with MFI topology) for phenol conversion, with TS-1 giving higher selectivities toward hydroquinone. Medium pore size CoAPO-11 was more active than larger pore CoAPO-50, -36 and -5. The external surfaces of the catalysts play a significant role in these oxidation reactions.
