Photocatalytic conversion of NO x on AgCl/Al2O3 catalyst Yohichi Yamashita a Naoko Aoyama a Nobutsune Takezawa b Kiyohide Yoshida a a Riken Corporation, Suehiro 4-14-1, Kumagaya, Saitama 360-8522, Japan b Division of Materials Science and Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-8628, Japan The rate of NO conversion under UV illumination was evaluated over Ag/Al2O3 and AgCl/Al2O3 catalysts at room temperature. The AgCl/Al2O3 catalyst is highly active for the conversion of NO x . The conversion is enhanced in the presence of O2 and further enhanced when oxygen coexists with hydrocarbons. Diffuse reflectance spectra of AgCl/Al2O3 and Ag/Al2O3 show an absorption band at ∼250 nm, and a weak and broad band at ∼230 nm, respectively. The high photocatalytic NO x conversion is achieved over the AgCl/Al2O3 catalyst. The conversion level of NO x is maintained above 60% over 5 h in the presence of O2 and hydrocarbons under UV-irradiation. The absorption band at ∼250 nm is ascribed to the band gap energy of crystallized AgCl particles on Al2O3. These results suggest that high photocatalytic NO x conversion proceeds on crystallized AgCl particles formed on Al2O3. Keywords Photocatalytic conversion NO x AgCl/Al2O3 catalyst 1 Introduction Application of photocatalysis has been recently studied for the NO x reduction [1–4]. Ibusuki and Takeuchi [1]reported that dilute NO x in ambient air is effectively removed by photocatalytic oxidation on TiO2. Anpo et al. [2]found that NO is decomposed to N2 and O2 on Cu/ZSM-5 under the UV irradiation in the absence of oxygen. In addition, they showed that NO is photocatalytically converted into N2, N2O and NO2 on Ag/ZSM-5 in the presence of oxygen [3]. Miyadera et al. found that an alumina-supported silver (Ag/Al2O3) catalyst is highly effective for the reduction of NO x with propene [5–7]and ethanol [6–8, 22, 9, 10]. Recently, Aoyama et al. have found that an AgCl/Al2O3 [7, 11]catalyst also exhibits high activity for the reduction of NO x with ethanol and propene. The present work is extended to study the NO conversion on Ag/Al2O3 and AgCl/Al2O3 catalysts under photo-irradiation in a model gas flow containing NO, NO and O2 or NO, O2, C2H6 and C3H8. It is shown that the AgCl/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits high NO x conversion under photo-irradiation. 2 Experimental The Ag/Al2O3 and AgCl/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by impregnation of γ-Al2O3 powders (230 m2/g, Condea Chemie) with an aqueous solution of silver nitrate, and aqueous solution of silver nitrate and ammonium chloride, respectively. The resulting samples were then dried at 393 K for 3 h and calcined at 873 K for 2 h in air. The Ag content in these catalysts was 2.0 wt.%. No appreciable difference in Ag or Cl content was observed between bulk AgCl/Al2O3 dried at 393 K and calcined at 873 K. The NO x conversion was evaluated using a flow-type photochemical reaction system as shown in Fig. 1 . The catalyst (3 g) was packed in a reactor made of quartz and irradiated by using a 500 W Xe lamp (UXL-500D, USHIO). Irradiation area was ca. 6 cm2 and light intensity was ca. 60 mW/cm2 (at 365 nm). A reaction gas stream containing 10 ppm NO, 10% (or 0%) O2, 5 ppm (or 0 ppm) C2H6, 5 ppm (or 0 ppm) C3H8 and balance N2 was flowed at a rate of 620 cm3/min. The concentration of NO x (NO+NO2) in the outlet gas stream was measured with a chemiluminescence based NO/NO x analyzer. The Ag/Al2O3 and AgCl/Al2O3 catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using CuKα radiation (MPX3, MAC-Science) and ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) diffuse reflectance spectra using a Shimadzu UV-2400PC spectrometer before and after the NO x reduction under photo-irradiation. Products under photo-irradiation to the Ag/Al2O3 and AgCl/Al2O3 catalysts in the presence of NO (25 Torr) were measured by a mass spectrometer (UPM-ST-200P, ULVAC). 3 Results and discussion Fig. 2 Fig. 3 Fig. 4 show the NO x conversion at room temperature on the γ-Al2O3, Ag/Al2O3 and AgCl/Al2O3 catalysts under irradiation with a 500 W-Xe lamp. On the γ-Al2O3, the rate of NO x conversion is very low in the absence of O2 (Fig. 2a). On the other hand, reduction of NO x occurs rapidly on the Ag/Al2O3 and the AgCl/Al2O3 catalysts (Fig. 2b and 2c). Sixty to sixty five percent of NO x is initially converted on the AgCl/Al2O3 catalyst while about 10% of NO x is converted on the Ag/Al2O3 catalyst. By mass spectrometric measurements it was shown that UV irradiation to the AgCl/Al2O3 and Ag/Al2O3 catalysts in the presence of NO (25 Torr) led to the formation of N2O. NO x conversion over the Ag/Al2O3 and AgCl/Al2O3 catalysts is enhanced in the presence of oxygen (Fig. 3). Initial conversion of NO x is 70–75% on AgCl/Al2O3. The conversion level of NO x over Ag/Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3 is much lower than that over AgCl/Al2O3. It is to be noted that the NO x conversion is further enhanced in the presence of hydrocarbons along with oxygen on the AgCl/Al2O3 catalyst (Fig. 4). The conversion reaches 75–78% over AgCl/Al2O3, while that over Ag/Al2O3 or γ-Al2O3 is 11% or 3%. It was found that more than 10 mol of NO is converted for 1 mol of AgCl in the long time experiments. Thus, it is suggested that NO is photocatalytically converted on the AgCl/Al2O3. Fig. 5 shows the UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the γ-Al2O3, Ag/Al2O3 and AgCl/Al2O3 catalysts calcined at 873 K in air. The Ag/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits a broad and weak absorption band at ∼230 nm followed by a shoulder at ∼300 nm and the spectra are different from those of γ-Al2O3. On the other hand, an intense absorption band appears at ∼250 nm for the AgCl/Al2O3 catalyst calcined at 873 K. Fig. 6 shows the XRD spectra of the γ-Al2O3, Ag/Al2O3 and AgCl/Al2O3 catalysts calcined at 873 K in air. No XRD peaks attributable to crystallized silver metal or silver compounds are seen in the spectra of the Ag/Al2O3 catalyst. We previously reported [7]that oxidation of the Ag/Al2O3 catalyst at 873 K induced an interaction between Ag and Al2O3, resulting in the growth of the disordered silver oxide particles on Al2O3. Thus, the broad and weak absorption band at ∼230 nm in Fig. 5b is attributable to the silver oxides on Al2O3. The shoulder band at ∼300 nm is ascribed to the Ag0 atoms reported by Ozin and Huber [12]. On the other hand, distinct XRD peaks attributable to crystallized AgCl are observed for the AgCl/Al2O3 catalyst calcined at 873 K. The present AgCl/Al2O3 catalyst calcined at 873 K in air showed high NO x conversion under UV irradiation. The absorption band observed at ∼250 nm in the UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of AgCl/Al2O3 is attributed to the band gap energy of crystallized AgCl particles [13–15]on Al2O3. Thus, it is suggested that crystallized AgCl particles on Al2O3 play an important role in the high NO x conversion on AgCl/Al2O3 under UV irradiation. The AgCl/Al2O3 catalyst calcined at 773 K in air showed low NO x conversion under UV irradiation compared with that calcined at 873 K in air. By XRD measurements, it was shown that calcination of the catalyst below 773 K results in the formation of large crystallized AgCl particles on Al2O3 [16]. In contrast, calcination at temperatures higher than 773 K leads to the formation of highly dispersed AgCl particles [16]. The dispersion was enhanced on calcination at 873 K. Thus, high NO x conversion under UV irradiation observed on the AgCl/Al2O3 catalyst calcined at 873 K in air is ascribed to the progress of the dispersion of AgCl on Al2O3. The rate of NO x conversion decreased gradually in the absence of O2 with reaction time (Fig. 2). On the other hand, the presence of oxygen and hydrocarbons suppressed the lowering of the rate (Figs. 3 and 4). The conversion level of NO x was maintained above 60% over 5 h under UV irradiation in the presence of O2 and hydrocarbons over the AgCl/Al2O3 catalyst. Fig. 7 shows the XRD spectra of the AgCl/Al2O3 catalysts observed before and after NO x conversion for 30 min in the presence of O2 under photo-irradiation. The photo-irradiation results in the formation of crystallized metallic Ag particles. Fig. 8 shows UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the AgCl/Al2O3 catalysts observed before and after the photo-irradiation. An intense absorption band at ∼210 nm and a broad and weak absorption band at 300∼500 nm appear with the intense absorption band at ∼250 nm in UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the catalyst after the photo-irradiation. The absorption band at ∼210 nm is attributed to the 4d10→4d95s1 electron transition of isolated Ag+ ions [3, 17–19]whereas that at 300–500 nm is attributed to the Ag0 atom, Ag n 0 and Ag m n+ clusters [12, 20]. Thus, it is suggested that the photo-irradiation leads to the formation of isolated Ag+ ions which are followed by the formation of Ag0 atom, Ag n 0, and Ag m n+ clusters. The lowering of photocatalytic conversion of NO on the AgCl/Al2O3 catalyst UV-irradiated is ascribed to the formation of Ag0 atom, Ag n 0, and Ag m n+ clusters. Fig. 9 compares NO x conversion evaluated in the presence of oxygen for the fresh catalyst and the catalyst calcined again at 873 K in air after the photo-irradiated. The NO x conversion is almost recovered to its initial one before photo-irradiation by the calcination of the irradiated catalysts at 873 K. Fig. 10 shows UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra observed for the fresh catalyst and the catalyst calcined again at 873 K in air. The UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectrum for the calcined catalyst is also almost restored to that for the fresh catalyst. These results suggest that the recovering of crystallized AgCl particles leads to the increase in the rate of NO x conversion. Under photo-irradiation, electrons and holes are probably produced by photoactivation of the crystallized AgCl on Al2O3. The Ag0 atom, Ag n 0 and Ag m n+ clusters are formed by reaction between the created electrons and Ag+ ions [21]. Thus, it is suggested that the presence of oxygen suppresses the formation of Ag0 atom, Ag n 0 and Ag m n+ clusters, and stabilizes crystallized AgCl particles formed on Al2O3. Presence of hydrocarbons enhanced the conversion of NO x as shown in Fig. 4. Hydrocarbons probably react readily with holes produced by photoactivation, suppressing the recombination of the created electron and hole. Thus, it is suggested that higher NO x conversion in the presence of hydrocarbons is ascribed to a more efficient electron charge transfer into the π anti-bonding molecular orbital of NO. Further studies concerning the reaction mechanism and the stability of the AgCl/Al2O3 catalyst performance are currently under way. References 1 T. Ibusuki K. Takeuchi J. Mol. Catal. 88 1994 93 2 M.
