ACODEDJI, J. LIETO* and J. P. AUNE Institut de Petroleochimie et de Synthese Organique Industrielle, Centre de St-Jerome, Rue Henri Poincare, 13397 Marseilles, Cedex 13 (France) (Received December 12, 1982) Summary Anchored Pd salts have been prepared and characterized by infrared spectroscopy. The supported salts are active for the decomposition of cyclo- hexyl hydroperoxide into trons-2-hexenal, and give similar results as their soluble analogues when mass-transfer limitations can be avoided. Introduction Palladium salts are mainly used as catalysts for olefin hydrogenation and isomerization [1-10]. However, PdCU2\" has recently been used for producing ^rans-2-hexenal from the decomposition of cyclohexyl hydro- peroxide (CHHPO) [11-13]. This organic compound finds many applica- tions in food and perfumes preparation and as pheromon agent for insects [11]. Its preparation is illustrated by the following reaction scheme n\"\" ^^ \" rf+ n^^J10 k^ Gyclohexane, 353 K ^^' k^-1 The new synthesis path for fcrans-2-hexenal using soluble Pd salt presents a problem associated with the catalyst recovery: during the reaction the soluble catalyst decomposes into Pd aggregates which are difficult to recover. We addressed this problem by using PdCU2\" salts anchored on func- tionalized supports. We present here the preparation and characterization of supported Pd salts responsible for frans-2-hexenal production from CHHPO decomposition. A comparison of the catalytic activity of the supported salt with its soluble analogue is also presented. *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/83/$3.00 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 74 Experimental The complex K^PdCl^ was prepared according to a described procedure [14]. The commercial supports Amberlyst A-27 and Dowex-1 were succes- sively washed with 5% hydrochloric acid solution, ethanol and hexane and dried under vacuum. The solids lost approximately 30% of their weight after this treatment. Poly(styrene-divinylbenzene) membranes and beads were prepared and functionalized according to described procedures [15]. The functional groups of the supports are typified in Table 1. The attachment of the Pd complex to the supports followed a literature procedure [10]. Samples Sl - S4 were obtained (Table 2). The CHHPO decomposition was carried out in a 100 ml jacketted reactor, equipped with a nitrogen inlet, a sampling cap and a magnetic stirrer. The temperature was controlled by means of hot fluid circulation through the jacket. The CHHPO was obtained from Rhone Poulenc Industries Ltd., and shown to be 92% pure by potentiometric titration. In a typical reaction, 1 g of beads incorporating Pd salts, 2 mg of FeS04'7H20 as an initiator and 1.5 ml of water were charged under N3 in the reactor. The hot fluid circulation and the stirring were then started. When a steady temperature was reached (353 K) a solution of CHHPO in cyclohexane (0.28 g : 2.3 mmol/3 ml) was syringed in the reactor. After continuous stirring for 1 h under an inert atmosphere the catalyst was recovered by filtration. The organic layer was separated from the water layer TABLE 1 Functional groups present in the supports Supports Functional groups N (wt.%) Cl (wt.'

The organic and ether layers were mixed, dried overnight over CaCIa and analyzed. The reaction could also be monitored by sampling and analyzing small aliquots of the reaction mixture. The analyses were performed using a gas chromatograph equipped with a 3 m long, 0.0032 m diameter, stainless-steel column (10% Carbowax 20M, on Chromosorb 60/80M), a flame ionization detector and an electronic integrator. A Nicolet FTIR 7199 was used for the IR catalyst characterization. Results and discussion Palladium tetrachloride salts were attached to four supports. The func- tional groups incorporated in these supports are typified in Table 1. The color and the Pd and Cl contents of the different solids (Samples Sl - S4) are reported in Table 2. Identification of the supported species was made by FTIR by compari- son of the spectra of the solids incorporating the Pd species with that of a known molecular compound. The results of this comparison are reported in Table 3 and illustrated in Fig. 1. The structure of the Pd salt was preserved after fixation as evidenced by FTIR. We observed a good correspondence between the bands corresponding to Pd Cl vibration in the supported and soluble state. The slight differences reported in Table 3 and Fig. 1 in the Pd Cl vibration can be explained by the different nature of the substituents on the ammonium groups, as demonstrated by preliminary ESCA results. The Pd oxidation degree was slightly higher in the soluble salt than in the complex embedded in the polymer Sl. Furthermore, the molar ratio Pd/Cl in S3 was close to 4 (Table 2), pointing to the presence of the PdO^2\" struc- ture. As expected, commercial supports which included binding agents and impurities, led to poorly-defined spectra, whereas the tailor-made, nearly transparent membranes led to better spectra.

Far-infrared spectra of supported and soluble palladium salts. A: ((CH3CH2)4N)2PdCl4; B: K^PdCU; C: ((P)-N(CH3)3),PdCl4 (S4). The supported complexes were air stable. They reacted with hydrogen to produce metal aggregates (26 A) as observed by electron microscopy. These aggregates were responsible for the observed olefin hydrogenation activity when a mixture of olefin and hydrogen was flowed over the solids. The solids then acquired an irreversible black color and did not exhibit any IR bands associated with Pd Cl bonds. The solids incorporating PdC^2\" salts were tested as catalysts for CHHPO decomposition. The experimental conditions were similar to those indicated in the literature for the same reaction catalyzed by soluble PdC^2\" [11]. A comparison of the yields obtained with the different solids and the soluble complexes is reported in Table 4. It was verified that PdC^2\" was responsible for the formation of trans- 2-hexenal by running a blank reaction with a support lacking the catalyst. The thermal decomposition of CHHPO led uniquely to cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol (Table 4). The different activities of the soluble and supported catalysts can be explained on the basis of diffusional problems. Yields of frans-2-hexenal obtained with porous beads (Sl - S3) are smaller than those obtained with the soluble salts. Any indication of the reaction rate being limited by pore diffusion could be obtained by changing the bead size. When the beads were crushed, a fine aggregate powder containing Pd salts was obtained which could not be properly dispersed in the reactor. However, the energy of activation of the CHHPO decomposition reaction induced by Sl (with a porous support) was equal to 3.6 kcal mol~1. This low value pointed to the probable presence of mass-transfer limitations in the pores.

The catalysts turned black after the CHHPO decomposition reaction. This color is indicative of the presence of Pd metal on the support, and has been verified by ESCA and electron microscopy [16]. It was impossible to quantify this Pd metal formation. However, the catalyst degradation was slow enough to allow the same catalyst batch (Sl) to be used as much as seven times but with a progressive decrease in activity. The IR spectrum of the catalyst showed a continuous intensity decay of the Pd Cl band as the number of times of use increased. The activity stopped when the IR band disappeared completely, thus indicating that Pd metal is inert toward the decomposition of CHHPO. Thus we conclude that on average 1 mol of Pd salts supported on Dowex (Sl) transform 25.8 mol of CHHPO into 7.2 mol of trans-2-hexenal. The formation of cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol can partly be attributed to thermal decomposition, as indicated in Table 4. Current investigations are aimed at obtaining kinetics measurement of the traras-2-hexenal formation using a gas flow system and a membrane support which will allow simultaneous infrared analysis of the catalyst in the functioning state.
