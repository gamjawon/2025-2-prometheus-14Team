The mesoporous catalyst is significantly more active than the microporous catalyst; the zeolite supported catalyst is inactive under the same conditions. The results illustrate the effect of pore size on the reaction rate for large molecules. Both mesoporous and microporous catalysts show good stability and a high selectivity towards formation of primary amine. The reaction order in hydrogen is positive with both catalysts; the apparent reaction order in nitrile is negative with the mesoporous catalyst but positive with the microporous catalyst. The activation energy of the reaction is about 90 kJ/mol. TPR data show that under the conditions chosen for pretreatment no SO4 reduction takes place; at higher temperature the sulfur is reduced from S6+ to S2 . ~i 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. Keywords.

Introduction The ideal solid catalyst should have a high density of active sites that are easily accessible to reactant molecules; it should selectively catalyze the reaction for which it is designed and not deactivate. For the conversion of large molecules, in particular in the liquid phase, the need for high site density and good accessibility translates into a catalyst structure which *Corresponding author.

Many traditional catalysts using microporous supports fail to achieve optimum performance because the transport of large molecules through narrow pores limits the overall rate. Even for the gas phase hydrogenation of benzene a positive effect of wider pores on the turn- over frequency over supported Rh catalysts has been reported by del Angel et al., who compared A1203 and various zeolites as supports [1]. At the other extreme, macroporous systems are limited by low surface area, resulting in low site density. An optimum compromise 0926-860X/97/$I7.00 ~i!, 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Sachtler/Applied Catalysis A: General 163 (1997) 245 254 of high site density and good transport characteristics can be achieved by catalysts with a mesoporous structure. A well-known example for such material is the aluminosilicate MCM-41 [2,3]. It excels because of a regular arrangement of pores wide enough to transport large molecules; unfortunately the sites at the pore walls of MCM-41 appear to be weaker acids than those in microporous zeolites. With other mesoporous transition metal oxides that have been reported more recently [4], the thermal stability is unsatisfactory because the pore structure collapses when crystallization takes place [5]. Mesoporous zirconia has been prepared by a con- trolled sol-gel process in the presence of surfactant which acts as a template, followed by ethanol extrac- tion to remove the template. Without further precau- tions, the mesoporous structure is maintained up to 300; above this temperature crystallization leads to the collapse of the pores. A much more stable material has, however, been obtained by sulfating prior to calcination; in this case the mesopores survive heating to 650, even while substantial crystallization to tetragonal zirconia takes place [6]. When probed as an acidic catalyst with small molecules, this material shows the same activity as microporous sulfated zir- conia. Upon testing it for the liquid phase reaction of large molecules, such as the alkylation of 1-naphthol with 4-tert-butylstyrene, the mesoporous catalyst is distinctly superior to its microporous counterpart; it is not only more active but also shows a higher selec- tivity towards the ortho-alkylated product [6]. Coke formation is a major cause of deactivation for these and other acidic catalysts. It can be controlled by adding a platinum metal to the catalyst and working under an atmosphere of hydrogen. Indeed, very stable butane isomerization catalysts have been prepared in this laboratory by combining sulfated zirconia (SZ) with platinum [7,8]. These results inspired us to study mesoporous SZ as a support for a transition metal and to probe such catalysts for the hydrogenation of a large molecule in the liquid phase. For this purpose, the hydrogenation of stearonitrile, C17H35CN, to octa- decylamine, CIsH37NH2, was chosen as the probe reaction. Ruthenium was chosen as the transition metal because preliminary studies had shown its high selectivity towards primary amines. The reaction was carried out in the liquid phase under a high hydrogen pressure. This paper reports the results of these tests and compares them with tests in which Ru, supported in microporous SZ, or on the zeolite HY, was used under identical conditions. A conventional analysis of the reaction kinetics and some catalyst characterization by temperature programmed reduction (TPR), tempera- ture programmed desorption (TPD), and transmission electron microscope (TEM) are also included. 2. Experimental 2.1. Sample preparation and pretreatment Mesoporous zirconia was synthesized by the pro- cedure described in [6]. 7 g of the surfactant hexa- decylamine was mixed with 70 ml water under gentle heating. 45 ml of 70% zirconium propoxide was homogenized with 5 ml acetylacetone and added to the surfactant-water mixture under strong stirring. Stirring was continued for another 30 min. The mix- ture was aged at room temperature (RT) for 120 h, separated by centrifuging and the solid was dried in air. To remove most of the organic components by extraction, the solid material was subsequently treated twice with 90% ethanol (50 ml/g) at 80 and dried in air at 110. Sulfation was performed by immersing mesoporous zirconia in 1 N sulfuric acid (15 ml/g) for 15 min, filtering and drying in air at I 10. The material was calcined at 650 for 2 h in a carefully controlled flow of oxygen. Microporous SZ was obtained by calcining SZ hydroxide (MEI) at 650~C for 1 h with a high ramping rate, as described in [9]. As reported in [6], the mesoporous and microporous SZ samples have similar surface areas, sulfur content, and contents of the tetragonal phase. They differ only in their pore size distribution characteristics. Fig. 1 shows their pore size distribution l~rofiles. The meso- pores have a radius of Rp=18.5 A while the micro- pores have a radius of Rp<10 A. SZ supported ruthenium was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of SZ with an aqueous solution of RuCI3.3H20. The catalysts were dehydrated in flowing N2 at 450cC for 1 h, reduced in H2 at 200 for 4 h and sealed in glass tubes under N2 before catalytic testing. Y-Y Huang, W.M.H.

Pore size distribution of sulfated zirconia supports. 40 A Ru/HY sample with 3 wt% Ru loading was prepared by ion exchange of Ru(NH3)6C13. NH4Y from Union Carbide was exchanged twice with 1 N NH4NO3 before use. A 0.01 N Ru(NH3)6C13 solution was added dropwise to a water/NH4Y slurry (800 ml/ g) under stirring. Stirring was continued for 48 h at RT. Then the material was filtered, washed and dried in air at RT. Before catalytic testing, the material was pre- treated in the same way as the Ru/SZ catalysts. 2.2. TPR and TPD TPR and TPD experiments were carried out in an open flow system with automatic flow control and equipped with a TCD cell. TPR profiles were recorded in 5% H2/Ar of 30 ml/min from RT to 750 at 8/ min while TPD profiles were recorded in an Ar flow of 30 ml/min from -70 to 650 at 8/min. Prior to a TPD experiment, samples were dehydrated in a He flow of 60 ml/min at 450 for 1 h and reduced in situ in a H2 flow of 30 ml/min at 200 for 2 h. After cooling to RT and holding there for 30 min in the flowing H2, samples were purged with argon for 30 rain. 2.3. TEM TEM analysis was done on a Hitachi HF-2000 high resolution analytic electron microscope equipped with an emission cathode operated at 200 kV in bright field mode. 2.4. Catalytic testing Liquid phase hydrogenation of stearonitrile was performed in a 300 ml autoclave (Autoclave Engi- neers). Typically, 50ml heptane (Aldrich, HPLC grade) and 0.05 mol stearonitrile (Aldrich, 90%, tech- nical grade) were mixed inside the autoclave. The reduced catalyst (500 mg) was rapidly added to this mixture and another 50 ml heptane was added. Alter closing the autoclave, it was purged with hydrogen for about 15 rain under stirring of 300 rpm. After filling the system with hydrogen to 24 bar at RT, the reaction was started by heating while the stirring rate was set at 1500 rpm. It took about 15 min for the system to reach the designated temperature. After that the reaction was continued for a certain time and the temperature and pressure of the system were recorded continuously. At the end of a run the reactor was cooled under stirring. At RT the gas phase mixture was released and about 1 ml liquid sampled for analysis. After supplying fresh H2 and/or nitrile, the next reaction cycle was carried out. GC-MS and J3C NMR were used tbr the analysis of the reaction mixture. GC-MS gives the ratio of nitrile and primary amine while 13C NMR provides the distribution of primary, secondary and tertiary amines. The initial reaction rate was obtained by extrapolat- ing the measured pressure-time curves in the constant temperature regime to t=0 and differentiating it at t=0. 3. Results 3.1. Characterization of catalysts Preliminary TPR experiments identified the best reduction conditions. Fig. 2 shows the TPR profiles for SZ, RuC13/microSZ and RuCl3/mesoSZ with 3 wt% Ru loading. The reduction of SZ was reported in a previous paper, from which the SZ profile has been taken over in Fig. 2110]. Reduction becomes detectable at 400, a single TPR peak is observed at 664. As reported in 248 Y.-E Huang, W.M.H.

TRP profile of SZ, RuCl3/microSZ and RuC13/mesoSZ. [10], the hydrogen consumption per sulfate ion corre- sponds to a H/S ratio of about 5, because 50% of the SO4 groups are reduced to SO2, the other 50% form a surface sulfide. The TPR patterns for RuC13/microSZ and RuC13/ mesoSZ look very similar. Three reduction peaks are observed at 158, 342 and 481 for RuC13/ microSZ and at 163, 335 and 485 for RuC13/mesoSZ, respectively. The peak at about 160 is attributed to the reduction of Ru3+ to Ru its position is close to the TPR peak of RuC13/A1203 [ 11 ]. The H2 consumption under this peak corresponds to a H/Ru ratio of 3.3 for RuC13/microSZ and 2.8 for RuC13/mesoSZ, respectively. The two peaks at higher temperatures are attributed to the reduction of sulfate. The combined hydrogen consumption under these two peaks corresponds to a H/S ratio of 7.8 for RuC13/ microSZ and 7.9 for RuCl3/mesoSZ, respectively, which is similar to the value reported previously for Pt/SZ : H/S=8 [10,12] and is expected for the valence change from S6+ to S2-. Ruthenium, like platinum, enhances the reduction of the sulfate, shifting the TPR peaks to a lower temperature; in addition it catalyzes the reduction of the SO+, formed over pure SZ, to HzS. As the reduction of the sulfate is negligible below 230, it was decided to reduce Ru at 200\"C and limit the temperature of the catalytic tests to 180C. Ha TPD and TEM experiments were performed to characterize the dispersion of Ru metal in Ru/SZ. The H2 TPD analysis shows that Ru/microSZ has a ratio of desorbed hydrogen to Ru, H/Ru=0.21 and Ru/ mesoSZ has a H/Ru=0.18. However, the TPD profiles of both RuC13/microSZ and RuC13/mesoSZ show that the desorption of hydrogen stops abruptly above 270~C, when reduction of sulfate by hydrogen becomes detectable. As a result of this sulfide poison- ing of the metal, it is not possible to derive the true Ru dispersion from H2 cbemisorption data. The TEM images of both RuCl3/microSZ and RuC13/mesoSZ are very similar; large particles of crystalline zirconia are clearly seen while Ru metal particles are barely visible. Ru is easily oxidized upon contacting air. Small Ru oxide particles cannot be distinguished from zirconia by TEM due to the similar atomic masses of Ru and Zr. However, large Ru oxide particles can be distinguished from zirconia by their different crystal fringes. The absence of these fringes thus suggests that the Ru dispersion is very high in both catalysts. For Ru/HY, it was shown previously that the true metal dispersion cannot be obtained from H2 chemi- sorption, because metal proton adducts are formed which suppress hydrogen chemisorption in the particle size range considered here. After heating in flowing N2 at 400+'C and then reducing in flowing H2 at 500C, a very low H/Ru ratio was observed by Hz TPD while all Ru particles were found located inside zeolite cages [13]. In the present work, Ru/HY was reduced at much lower temperature; the true metal dispersion thus should be even higher. Indeed, the white color of reduced Ru/HY indicates very small Ru particles. The Ru dispersion in RuCl3/microSZ and RuC13/ mesoSZ is assumed to be similar but lower than in Ru/HY, as follows from the gray color of both SZ supported samples. The results show that microporous and mesoporous SZ are chemically very similar: their main difference is the pore geometry. Comparison of these supports thus should show the effect of pore size distribution on catalysis, while all other variables are essentially kept constant. Y.-Y. Huang, W.M.H.

Activio, Jbr liquid phase hydrogenation of stearonitrile The real pressure-time curves of three catalysts, Ru/mesoporous SZ, Ru/microporous SZ and Ru/HY for liquid phase hydrogenation of stearonitrile with heptane as solvent at 180 and an initial hydrogen pressure of 24 bar are shown in Fig. 3. From the slope of the p=f(t) plots the -dp/dt=f(t) plots are con- structed as shown in Fig. 4. Conversion and selectivity data are listed in Table 1. Fig. 3 shows that initially the pressure rises while the temperature is increased. Once a constant tem- perature is reached, the pressure decreases with time for both Ru/SZ samples while it stays constant for Ru/HY. Clearly, Ru/mesoSZ and Ru/microSZ are active catalysts, whereas Ru/HY is inactive. The pressure-time plots show that the pressure increase during the warming-up period is lower with Ru/mesoSZ than with Ru/microSZ. Evidently, more H2 is consumed during the warming-up period with the former catalyst. After the temperature reaches the constant value, the system pressure keeps decreasing more rapidly with Ru/mesoSZ, which clearly indicates a higher catalytic activity of Ru/mesoSZ. Table 1 shows that the conversion of nitrile in the first reaction cycle is 85.2% with Ru/mesoSZ, but only 61.7% with Ru/microSZ. For both Ru/mesoSZ and Ru/microSZ, most of the nitrile is converted in the first reaction cycle. As a result, the slope -dp/dt is very low in the second reaction cycle with the same initial H2 pressure (see Fig. 4). After virtually all nitrile was converted, a new batch was added. After bringing, again, the H2 pres- sure to the initial value, the reaction rate, expressed by the -dp/dt value, is equal (within experimental error) to that in the first cycle. These data show that the decrease of the reaction rate during a cycle is due to the change in reactant and/or product composition, not to catalyst deactivation. The catalysts are quite stable under the reaction conditions used. Table 1 also shows that both Ru/mesoSZ and Ru/ microSZ produce primary amine with high selectivity in the first and second reaction cycles. In the third reaction cycle, after adding a new batch of nitrile, the selectivity to secondary amine is higher. This change 250 Y.-Y. Huang, W..M.H.

Note that the rate is very low in the second cycle because most nitrile was consumed in the first cycle. in selectivity is more pronounced for Ru/microSZ than for Ru/mesoSZ. 3.3. Reaction order Besides the partial pressure of H2, the measured total pressure contains the partial pressures of solvent and solutes which all change when the concentrations of the nitrile and the amines are changing during the catalytic reaction. The negative differential quotient of the total pressure, -dp/dt, is, therefore, only an approximate measure of the reaction rate. Its value extrapolated to t=0 is, however, considered a fairly reliable approximation for the desired value of -dp(Hz)/dt, because the pressure of the solvent and the concentration of the solute are initially equal for different runs at the same temperature; only the cata- lyst is different. The system pressure at t=0 can be reliably derived from the pressure at constant tem- perature with the inactive catalyst Ru/HY, which thus serves as a blank run. Values of -dp/dt at t---0 for runs with different initial concentrations of nitrile or hydro- gen have been used to determine the reaction orders in nitrile and hydrogen. In Fig. 5 the initial reaction rates, measured at 180 with the same nitrile concentration but different hydrogen pressures, are plotted as ln(-dp/dt)o against In P(H2)r-0. A straight line is obtained, its slope is 2.8 for Ru/mesoSZ and 1.7 for Ru/microSZ. Clearly, the reaction order in hydrogen is positive with both cata- lysts. As pore diffusion control usually brings a positive order down towards no 1, this could mean a higher extent of pore diffusion control for the microporous catalyst. Under constant hydrogen pressure but different nitrile concentrations at 180, different reaction rates, (-dp/dt)o are obtained. The plots of ln(-dp/dt)o versus In c0(nitrile), where Co stands for the con- centration at t---0, are shown in Fig. 6. They are linear; from their slopes a negative reaction order in nitrile of -0.72 is obtained for Ru/mesoSZ, but a positive value of 0.48 is obtained for Ru/microSZ. Y.-E Huang, W.M.H.

Activation energy By keeping the nitrile concentrations and the initial hydrogen pressures constant while changing the reac- tion temperature, the initial reaction rates were obtained as a function of temperature. The conver- sions are far enough from thermodynamic equilibrium that reverse rates can be ignored. The measured rates are plotted as ln(rate)o in Fig. 7 against 1/T. From the slopes of these lines, the apparent activation energies are calculated. A value of Ea=86.6 kJ/mol is found for Ru/mesoSZ and 94.9 kJ/mol for Ru/microSZ. This difference is not considered significant. 4. Discussion Many data on the hydrogenation of nitriles to amines are in patents [14], but a few review articles are in the open literature [15,16]. Transition metals, including Co, Ni, Ru, Cu, Rh, Pd and Pt, are known to catalyze this reaction [ 17]. The kind of metal used has a profound influence on the product selectivity. The metals Pd and Pt preferentially form tertiary amines, while Cu and Rh are selective towards secondary amines and Co, Ni and Ru have high selectivity for primary amines. The present results confirm that for stearonitrile hydrogenation, supported Ru catalysts show a high selectivity to primary amine. Volf and Pagek [15] state that the catalyst support has little effect on hydrogenation activity and selec- tivity. However, none of the reports known to us mentions zeolite or mesoporous supports. The present results indicate that for the hydrogenation of mole- cules as large as stearonitrile in the liquid phase, a zeolite supported Ru catalyst is all but inactive under conditions where microporous and mesoporous sup- ports give active catalysts. As separate experiments showed that stearonitrile is extensively adsorbed in zeolite NaY, the lack of catalytic activity of zeolite supported Ru is likely due to pore plugging by strongly adsorbed Cl8 nitrile or amines. The present results also show the superiority of the mesoporous over the microporous support, which conforms with the expectation that for large molecules wide pores improve accessibility of sites and facilitate diffusion of reactants and products. The outstanding stability of the present catalyst is in line with previous work, where Pt/SZ was used as catalyst for n-butane isomerization. Also in that work, catalysts were found to be extremely stable because the combination of Pt and a high pressure of hydrogen prevented formation of coke precursors [7,18]. In previous work it was shown that properly pre- pared SZ is a strong solid acid [19], though not a superacid, as assumed by some authors [20]. Acidity is not an issue in the present work. For the hydrogenation of acetonitrile over Ni catalysts, Verhaak et al. reported that the primary amine is formed in high yields only over basic supports; these authors assume that acid sites catalyze the condensation of primary to secondary amines [21]. The latter statement is not confirmed with the present ruthenium catalysts; the primary amine always prevails in spite of a fairly high acidity of the support. When SZ is impregnated with RuC13, some of the strong acidity will disappear, as water is known to lower the acidity of SZ [22]. Sulfated tetragonal zirconia becomes a very strong acid only after calcination above 500c'C [23-25], whereas the Ru/SZ samples used in the present work were only dehydrated at 450. No attempt was, therefore, made in the present work to differentiate between the acid sites in the three prototype catalysts. The TPR data do not reveal any chemical differences in the state of Ru; they justify the interpretation of the results on the basis of pore structure and transport properties. The reactivity and kinetics data obtained over the mesoporous catalyst indicate a highly positive reac- tion order in hydrogen and a negative order in nitrile. Qualitatively, this is what one would expect for two reactants of vastly different heats of adsorption that compete for the same sites. In the steady state, the metal sites will be mainly covered with adsorbed nitrile, which inhibits the chemisorption of hydrogen. The situation is reminiscent of the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide over Co catalysts: CO is much more strongly adsorbed than H2; therefore, the reaction order is positive in H2 but negative in CO. If such a situation is modified by classical pore diffusion con- trol, this would lead to a steady state where deep in the pores the population of adsorbed nitrile will be smal- ler, and that of the less strongly adsorbed amines larger, than near the pore mouths. In that simple picture, the catalytic sites deep in the pores are no longer overwhelmed by adsorbed nitrile. Conse- 254 Y-Y Huang, V~M.H. Sachtler/Applied Catalysis A: General 163 (1997) 245-254 quently, the reaction order in hydrogen should become smaller and that of the nitrile less negative. Painting with a very broad brush, it seems that the difference in kinetics parameters between meso- and microporous support could be described by assuming that the kinetics over the microporous catalyst are partially pore diffusion controlled. 5. Conclusions 1. Ru/mesoSZ is a more active catalyst than Ru/ microSZ for the hydrogenation of large molecule as stearonitrile under high hydrogen pressure in the liquid phase. As both catalysts contain Ru in the same chemical state, the difference in activity is attributed to the difference in diffusion rates between micro- and mesoporous supports. 2. Mesoporous and microporous catalysts both pro- duce predominantly primary amines and show good stability. 3. There is no evident diffusion limitation of the reaction rate for the mesoporous catalyst, while for the microporous catalyst the reaction seems to be partially diffusion controlled.

Tel.: +1 847 4915263; fax: +1 847 4671018 Ruthenium supported on mesoporous sulfated zirconia was tested as a catalyst for the liquid phase hydrogenation of stearonitrile, >n-C17H35CN, and compared with Ru, supported on either microporous sulfated zirconia or the zeolite HY. The mesoporous catalyst is significantly more active than the microporous catalyst; the zeolite supported catalyst is inactive under the same conditions. The results illustrate the effect of pore size on the reaction rate for large molecules. Both mesoporous and microporous catalysts show good stability and a high selectivity towards formation of primary amine. The reaction order in hydrogen is positive with both catalysts; the apparent reaction order in nitrile is negative with the mesoporous catalyst but positive with the microporous catalyst. The activation energy of the reaction is about 90 kJ/mol. TPR data show that under the conditions chosen for pretreatment no SO4 reduction takes place; at higher temperature the sulfur is reduced from S6+ to S2−.
