Tel.: +45-45-27-22-02; fax: +45-45-27-29-99 The catalytic ammonia synthesis activities of four supported ruthenium catalysts are reported. It is seen that Ru/MgAl2O4 is more active than two similar Ru/C catalysts, which are significantly more active than Ru/Si3N4. The activity differences cannot be satisfactorily explained solely by the differences in dispersion. Recent results from single crystal studies and DFT calculations have shown that ammonia synthesis over ruthenium catalysts is a very structure sensitive reaction, more so than on iron catalysts. It is suggested that special B5-type sites are primarily responsible for the catalytic activity of the present supported Ru catalysts. It is shown how the number of such B5-type sites depends on the Ru crystal size for a given crystal morphology. We have found that the activity of the Ru/MgAl2O4 catalyst increases significantly during the initial part of a test run. This activity increase is paralleled by the disappearance of crystals smaller than ca. 1.0nm due to sintering and a resulting formation of larger crystals. We conclude that there exists a lower limit to the desired crystal size of Ru in supported ammonia synthesis catalysts. This is in agreement with a low number of B5-type sites expected for such crystal sizes. Furthermore, we suggest that the support plays a decisive role in controlling the morphology of the Ru crystals and the resulting change in abundance of B5-type sites is the main cause for the significant activity variations observed for Ru catalysts with different supports. Finally, the support may also influence the electronic and catalytic properties of neighboring B5-type sites. Keywords Ruthenium Ammonia synthesis Structure sensitivity B5 sites 1 Introduction The catalytic ammonia synthesis technology has played a central role in the development of the chemical industry during the 20th century. This industrial importance has been paralleled by a significant scientific interest in understanding and improving the ammonia synthesis catalyst. Often new techniques, methods, and theories of catalysis have initially been developed and applied in connection with studies of this system. Similarly, new discoveries in the field of ammonia synthesis have been extended to other areas of catalysis. The combined influence of refined characterization techniques, improved kinetic analyses, and new possibilities in theoretical modeling has led to a detailed insight into the fundamentals of ammonia synthesis catalysts. Several recent reviews give a comprehensive account of the current understanding of catalytic ammonia synthesis [1–4]. It is an interesting paradox that despite these efforts the industrial ammonia synthesis catalyst is still very similar to that developed by Mittasch and co-workers. Ammonia synthesis over iron-based catalysts is the standard textbook example of a structure sensitive [5] heterogeneous catalytic reaction. This was first evident by the variation of the turnover frequency (TOF) with metal particle size, the TOF being higher for large Fe particles than for small ones in an Fe/MgO catalyst [6,7]. Later, measurements of the rate-determining step, the N2 dissociation [8,9], as well as the ammonia synthesis rate over different Fe surface planes on single crystals [10,11] provided independent support of the structure sensitivity. The Fe(111) surface is superior to the Fe(100) and the Fe(110) surfaces in both reactions. The conclusion from this pioneering surface science study [10,11] and the studies of small iron particles was that the most active site for ammonia synthesis over iron is an ensemble of Fe atoms including a C7 atom, i.e. a surface atom with seven nearest neighbors. The experimental findings on the Fe(111) surface have been supported by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations [12]. It was first realized by the group of Haber that ruthenium catalysts are potentially interesting ammonia synthesis catalysts [13] and later the work of Ozaki and Aika [3] has led to renewed interest in such catalysts. Recently, promoted Ru/C catalysts have been introduced in commercial operation [14–18]. However, it is still not clear whether the significantly higher cost and shorter life-time is justified by the higher activity compared to traditional iron-based catalysts. From recent single crystal studies, DFT calculations, and studies of supported catalysts it was found that ammonia synthesis over ruthenium is an even more structure sensitive reaction than over iron-based catalysts [19–22]. Based on these results, dramatic support and particle size effects can be expected and in order to obtain a more detailed understanding of this structure sensitivity we have conducted an investigation of a series of ruthenium catalysts supported on different materials. From these studies it is apparent that the activities of such catalysts are very dependent on the choice of support. The present high resolution electron microscopy studies suggests that these activity variations can be attributed to a combined influence of the crystal size distribution and the support induced morphology of the ruthenium crystals. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation Powdered magnesium aluminum spinel [23] and α-Si3N4 (obtained from H.C. Starck) were pressed into pellets using an IR press. Carbon extrudates (Norit RO 0.8) were graphitized at 1900°C according to the procedure of Kowalczyk et al. [24]. The catalyst supports were crushed and sieved to a particle size of 0.1–0.2mm prior to Ru impregnation using incipient wetness impregnation with ruthenium nitrosyl nitrate (Johnson Matthey). The impregnated support materials were dried at room temperature overnight and reduced at 1bar in flowing hydrogen at 450°C for 48h. 2.2 Catalyst testing After reduction the catalysts were passivated by treatment with 1000ppm O2 in nitrogen at room temperature. Subsequently, the sample was weighed and transferred to the testing unit previously described [25]. The catalytic activities were measured after reducing the passivated catalyst at 450°C in synthesis gas. The catalytic activities are reported on basis of the amount of catalyst loaded into the reactor. 2.3 Transmission electron microscopy TEM images were recorded using a Philips CM200 FEG instrument equipped with an UltraTwin lens (information limit 0.12nm), EDS and PEELS detectors. The operating voltage was 200kV. Images were obtained ex situ from reduced and passivated samples, and from samples passivated after reactor tests. For each sample, crystal size distributions were obtained from 10 to 20 images recorded at a magnification of 300000×. Image processing, i.e. automatic crystal identification, counting, and measurements were carried out using the ImagePro+ software. To obtain a crystal size distribution the diameter of 500–600 crystals in each sample were measured and the dispersion was calculated assuming spherical crystal morphology. 2.4 N2 adsorption/desorption Surface areas of support materials and reduced catalysts were obtained from dinitrogen adsorption and desorption using a Quantachrome Autosorb analyzer. 2.5 H2 adsorption The hydrogen chemisorption was conducted as described by Fastrup [26] for a series of Ru/MgAl2O4 catalysts. 3 Results All catalysts were prepared using ruthenium nitrosyl nitrate as a precursor and the supports were shown by chemical analyses to contain negligible (<15ppm) amounts of possible poisons such as chlorine or sulfur. Low concentrations of impurities have been shown to be able to significantly alter the reaction kinetics of supported Ru catalysts [27]. It has been shown that oxygen poisoning is negligible in the present testing unit [25]. The compositions of the four catalysts studied are summarized in Table 1 together with the surface areas and pore radii of the support materials. The testing was conducted in 3:1 and 1:1 mixtures of dihydrogen and dinitrogen at temperatures of 320, 360, 400, and 440°C at 50bar. The space velocity was varied to study the influence of the ammonia exit concentration on the reaction rate. Fig. 1 shows the catalytic activities of the four catalysts tested in a 3:1 mixture of H2 and N2 at 400°C. In all cases the activity increased by a factor of 2–3 when the catalysts were tested in a 1:1 mixture of H2 and N2. Apparent activation energies for the four catalysts are given in Table 2 . These activation energies are reported for constant flow since calculations of the activation energies at constant conversions unfortunately would require extensive extrapolations of our activity data. Figs. 2–4 illustrate transmission electron micrographs obtained from Ru/carbon(1), Ru/MgAl2O4, and Ru/Si3N4, respectively. The micrographs shown were obtained prior to the catalysts testing. In all cases micrographs were also obtained from the samples after testing. The dispersions determined by TEM and H2 chemisorption before testing are shown in Table 3 . The H2 dispersions are obtained by considering only the strongly bound hydrogen and by assuming a surface stoichiometry of H/Ru=1. The TEM dispersions were calculated by assuming spherical Ru crystals without contact to the support. It was observed that the Ru/MgAl2O4 catalyst increased its activity during the initial part of the testing. This behavior is contrary to the other catalysts studied, which exhibited very stable activities throughout the test runs. Therefore, we decided to follow the activity of the Ru/MgAl2O4 catalyst in more detail. In Fig. 5 below it is seen how the activity increases during the test run. The reported activity data for Ru/MgAl2O4 (e.g. Fig. 1) were obtained from measurements after the activity reached a stable level. To check that the activity increase is not related to the catalyst not being fully reduced we carried out a temperature programmed reduction (TPR) experiment (up to 600°C) of the catalyst in 1% dihydrogen in argon at 1atm. It was found that under these conditions the reduction is complete at 450°C and it appears reasonable to assume this is also the case when the partial pressure of dihydrogen is significantly higher. In Fig. 6 , we have shown the crystal size distribution of the Ru/MgAl2O4 catalyst after reduction (corresponding to situation A in Fig. 6) and after the activity test (corresponding to situation F in Fig. 5). 4 Discussion Table 1 shows some selected data for the catalysts studied. It is seen that the surface areas of MgAl2O4 and the carbon are significantly higher than that of α-Si3N4. For all catalysts the pore sizes are large enough that the activity data are not influenced by mass transfer limitations at the relatively low conversions reported (this has been shown to be the case for much more active catalyst under the same conditions [25]). From Fig. 1 it is seen that the activity varies by more than two orders of magnitude for the different catalysts. The one supported on MgAl2O4 is more active than the carbon supported catalysts which is much more active than the Si3N4 supported catalyst. Si3N4 has not attracted much interest as a catalyst support although it has several interesting properties and can be prepared with a high surface area. Recently, a palladium/Si3N4 was reported to be active in methane oxidation [28]. For ammonia synthesis Si3N4 could be interesting [29] since it is stable to hydrogenation contrary to carbon supports [30]. From Table 2, it is seen that the apparent activation energies vary significantly for the different catalysts. Aika et al. [31–33] and Rosowski et al. [34] have previously reported that both the activity and activation energy seem to depend strongly on the choice of support material and promoter. Aika et al. attempted to correlate the activity with the electronegativity of the support [3,32,33]. In their data both promoted and unpromoted catalysts are included and a fair correlation can be achieved. However, recent DFT calculations show that the promoter can only exert a significant influence on the activity if it is situated in the immediate neighborhood of the sites for dinitrogen dissociation [35,36]. In Table 3, the dispersions calculated from TEM and H2 chemisorption are given. It is seen that no satisfactory agreement between the numbers can be found. It has recently been shown by Kowalczyk et al. [37] that the dispersions obtained from H2 chemisorption on Ru/carbon catalysts are not reliable. Therefore, a careful study of the transmission electron micrographs was conducted to obtain accurate estimates of the particle sizes and these numbers will also be used in the following discussion. It is seen that the activity difference between the carbon supported and magnesium aluminum spinel supported catalysts can be explained by the difference in the number of active sites calculated from the metal concentrations and the TEM dispersions but not from the hydrogen chemisorption data. Also, the two catalyst systems show quite different activation energies. The activity of the Si3N4 supported catalyst is much lower than expected basis of either the TEM or H2 dispersions. The present results show, in agreement with previous work [3], that there is no direct correlation between the activity of Ru supported on different supports and the dispersion. In our recent microkinetic analysis we have shown that an excellent fit to the activity data can be obtained by taking the structure sensitivity of a Ru/MgAl2O4 catalyst into account [21]. Single crystal studies and DFT calculations [19,20] have indicated that the most active sites for N2 dissociation and ammonia synthesis are ensembles of five Ru atoms fulfilling two requirements: (1) they have to expose a three-fold hollow site and a bridge site close together and (2) part of the atoms have to be low-coordinated surface atoms such as edge atoms on small crystals. By fulfilling these requirements it is secured that the two nitrogen atoms of a dinitrogen molecule are not simultaneously bonded to the same Ru surface atom during dissociation. In the terminology of Van Hardeveld and Van Montfoort [38] these active sites are B5 sites involving edge atoms. In their analysis of marble models of Ni fcc crystals with a basic cubo-octahedral morphology, they found that B5 sites were only present on crystals with a size larger than ca. 1.5nm. The maximum probability for B5 sites was found for particles of 1.8–2.5nm and for particles larger than that, the probability for B5 sites monotonically decreased. In Fig. 7 , we have similarly counted the relative number of B5-type sites, which are part of edges on small Ru crystals with only hcp (001) and (100) surfaces exposed. Our result show the same trend as calculated by Van Hardeveld and Van Montfoort [38]. The reason for the lack of B5-type sites on very small crystals is identical in the two calculations; the crystals simply have to be of a certain size before the ensembles are formed. However, in our case the decreasing fraction of B5-type sites with increasing crystal size is not due to a general decrease in the number of these sites but to the fast decrease in the fraction of edge atoms as also shown in Fig. 7. These arguments are general for any crystal morphology, hence a maximum in the number of the most active sites at some intermediate crystal size should always be found. A maximum in ammonia synthesis activity would also be found if the number of active sites was taken relative to the number of surface atoms since the number of edge atoms is decreasing more rapidly than the number of surface atoms. In the transmission electron micrographs of the four catalysts studied (see Figs. 2–4) it is found that a significant fraction of the Ru crystals exhibit a hexagonal morphology. The crystal size distributions are generally broad and no specific orientation of the Ru crystals relative to the support seems favored in the Ru/C and Ru/MgAl2O4 catalysts. However, in the micrographs of Ru/Si3N4 it is seen that the Ru crystals appear to be facetted by the support material (Fig. 4 is typical for Ru/Si3N4), i.e. the edges of the Ru crystals are parallel to the lattice planes of the Si3N4 support. Such an effect is not observed for the Ru/C but cannot be excluded for the Ru/MgAl2O4 catalyst. In Fig. 5, it is shown how the activity of Ru/MgAl2O4 progressively increases during the initial part of the test run. It might be argued that the reduction has not been completed at the start of the run. However, this is not in agreement with our TPR results. To understand this activity increase, the crystal size distribution was determined before and after the test run as shown in Fig. 6. It is seen, that the smallest crystals have disappeared and larger crystals have formed. Therefore, we conclude that there exists a lower limit to the optimal ruthenium crystal size as also suggested in Fig. 7. Previously, similar slow activation phenomena have been observed by Aika et al. [33] and by Bossi et al. [39] for promoted and unpromoted Ru/MgO catalysts, and by Jacobsen and Fastrup [40] for promoted Ru/MgAl2O4 catalysts, but the cause(s) for the activation was not determined. In order to understand the activity pattern for the four Ru catalysts it appears necessary to take into account both the dispersion and the different interactions with the supports. It is suggested that both the size and the morphology of the Ru crystals is determined by the interaction with the support. This has a dramatic influence on the activity because of the extreme structure sensitivity. In addition to these structural and morphological effects we cannot exclude that electronic effects due to the support partially covering the Ru crystals may also be of importance. The difference in activation energies could be indicative of such a promotion/poisoning by the support and this might also explain why there is not a general agreement between the H2 and TEM dispersions. When the activity is determined by very few sites it is necessary to be very careful relating activity differences to one specific effect. The slow activation of unpromoted Ru catalysts also appears to be valid for promoted catalysts [3,39,40] and further studies are in progress to obtain more information about the behavior of promoted Ru catalysts on various support materials. 5 Conclusion The catalytic ammonia synthesis over supported Ru catalysts is a very structure sensitive reaction. The activity depends on the crystal size as shown in Fig. 7 for a given morphology. Generally, the exact position of the maximum depends on the morphology of the ruthenium crystals and it appears that the morphology is influenced by the support material. This must be taken into account when rationalizing the activities of different supported Ru catalysts. From the inspection of crystal models combined with experimental observations it is concluded that there exists a lower limit to the optimal crystal size in supported ruthenium catalyst for ammonia synthesis. Optimal catalysts exhibit the highest possible concentration of B5-type sites. The results indicate that partial coverage of the Ru crystals by the support may also take place and this may influence the electronic and catalytic properties. Due to the extreme structure sensitivity small changes in structural, morphological and electronic properties may have dramatic catalytic consequences and in view of the dominating role of a very low number of sites it may in real Ru catalyst systems be quite difficult to determine the relative role of the different effects.

        "dc:description": "The catalytic ammonia synthesis activities of four supported ruthenium catalysts are reported. It is seen that Ru/MgAl2O4 is more active than two similar Ru/C catalysts, which are significantly more active than Ru/Si3N4. The activity differences cannot be satisfactorily explained solely by the differences in dispersion. Recent results from single crystal studies and DFT calculations have shown that ammonia synthesis over ruthenium catalysts is a very structure sensitive reaction, more so than on iron catalysts. It is suggested that special B5-type sites are primarily responsible for the catalytic activity of the present supported Ru catalysts. It is shown how the number of such B5-type sites depends on the Ru crystal size for a given crystal morphology. We have found that the activity of the Ru/MgAl2O4 catalyst increases significantly during the initial part of a test run. This activity increase is paralleled by the disappearance of crystals smaller than ca. 1.0nm due to sintering and a resulting formation of larger crystals. We conclude that there exists a lower limit to the desired crystal size of Ru in supported ammonia synthesis catalysts. This is in agreement with a low number of B5-type sites expected for such crystal sizes. Furthermore, we suggest that the support plays a decisive role in controlling the morphology of the Ru crystals and the resulting change in abundance of B5-type sites is the main cause for the significant activity variations observed for Ru catalysts with different supports. Finally, the support may also influence the electronic and catalytic properties of neighboring B5-type sites.",
