Fierro Instituto de Catalisis y Petroleoquimica, C.S.LC. Serrano, 119, 28006 Madrid (Spain) (Received March 29, 1991; revised May 22, 1991) 1,6-Hexanedinitrile (adiponitrile) is used in nylon-6 and nylon-6,6 manufacture, undergoing partial hydrogenation to 6-aninohexanenitrile and then to 1,6-hexanediamine respectively [ 1 J. For this purpose, several catalysts are used industrially. Among these, copper, cobalt and iron are used at high pressures {270-600 bar, 100-180 C) [2]. Manganese-based catalysts can be used at lower pressure, but an excess of ammonia is essential to suppress secondary and tertiary amine formation [3], in which presumably the reaction proceeds through a diixnine intermediate [4]. Nickel and rhodium-based catalysts for hydrogenation of aminonitriles and dirutriles were also reported [5, 6]. Unfortunately, as most of the available literature is comprised of patents, often results of the characterization and detailed catalytic activity of the heterogeneous catalysts concerned are lacking. Here, we report studies involving the preparation, XRD phase identification and catalytic properties of several nickel catalysts which exhibited activity for the hydrogenation of adiponitrile at 1 atm pressure. Bulk nickel precursors wire prepared by air-calcination of nickel nitrate hexahydrate samples. These preparations will be designated hereafter as precursors 1-6. Supported precursors 6-17 were prepared by impregnation of iron(III) oxide with nickel and potassium nitrate aqueous solutions, yielding 0.21 g Ni g-1 Fe203. The amount of potassium was variable. This landing was 7 X 10`3 g K g-' Fe203 for precursors 6-13, 3.5 X 10-3 g K g-' Fe203 for 15, 1.05 X 10-2 g K g-' Fe203 for 16 and 1.4 X 10-~2 g K g-' FeZQ3 for 17. Precursor 14 was K-free. All samples were dried at 120 C and reduced with hydrogen/argon at a 1/20 volume ratio and temperatures shown in Table *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-51021911$3.50 0 1991 - Elsevier Sequoia, Lausanne L1O 1 (290 C for samples 14-17). Catalysts did not show diffusion restrictions. All reagents were reagent grade, and pure gases were previously dried and deoxygenated. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the catalysts were obtained with a Philips PW 1010 diffractometer using nickel-filtered Cu Ka radiation. The patterns were recorded over a range of 28 angles from 5 to 85 and compared with the X-ray powder files to confirm phases identity. Catalytic experiments were carried out in a fixed-bed flow tubular reactor using 1 g of catalyst. The hydrogenation of adiponitrile was carried out in the vapour phase at 180 C and 1 atm pressure, with a molar ratio adiponitrile/ hydrogen of 1/300 at a space velocity of 1500 h-;. Reaction products were analyzed by on-line gas chromatography using a 25 m phenylmethylsilicone capillary column and a 70-300 C oven temperature program. The following 28 (deg) values were obtained from the powder diffraction lines: 44.51vs, 51.85s, 76.36m for the Ni phase; 43.30vs, 37.29vs, 62.91m, 75.43w for the NiO phase; 35.43vs, 62.51m, 30.10m, 56.94m for the Fe304 magnetite phase and 44.67vs, 82.32m, 65.02w for -Fe phase. Table 1 compiles the XRD phases identification and reduction temperatures of the catalysts after on-stream reduction. Catalysts 14-17 show the same powder XRD pattern as 8, since they were all reduced at 290 C and only exhibit minor differences in potassium composition. Metallic nickel is observed only for bulk nickel catalysts reduced at temperatures above 225 C. However, potassium-promoted Fe203-supported nickel catalysts do not exhibit the presence of metal Ni diffraction lines, even at temperatures as high as 420 C, the highest reduction temperature used. Although the N10 phase is always present, the magnetite phase is obtained over the reduction temperature range 225-325 C, and only the a-Fe phase is found above 290 C. However, since crystallite sizes under 40 A are not actually detected by the powder X-ray technique, one may infer the existence of highly dispersed metal crystallites on those catalytically active samples (see below). Thus, magnetite and also a-Fe hinder NiO reduction and prevent the Ni microcrystallites, if any, from growing. Table 2 shows conversions and selectivities of these catalysts for the hydrogenation of adiponitrile under the conditions detailed above. The phases Fe203, Fe304, Fe and NiO proved catalytically inactive when tested separately in the pure form, whereas only reduced nickel exhibited catalytic activity for adiponitrile hydrogenation under the conditions specified in the Experimental section. Conversions are higher for bulk nickel catalysts reduced at temperatures in the range 200-300 C, probably due to their having crystallite sizes smaller than those reduced at higher temperatures (390 C). Among iron oxide/nickel catalysts (o-17) potassium was chosen as a convenient doping alkaline component from a previous report [7]. Ni particle sizes (under 40 A) and reduction degrees probably decrease with increasing potassium content in catalysts in the order 14 > 16 > $ > 16 > 17; in which the maximum and zero values of conversion may be interpreted in those terms.

Monoamine=6-aminohexanenitrile; diamine=1,6-hexanediamine; others= azacycloheptane mainly. L20 results, previously reported studies [ 7, 8 ] also showed a remarkable decrease in catalyst surface area with the presence of alkaline doping. High selectivities (100, 90 and 100%) in 6-aminohexanenitrile were obtained for catalysts 5, 12 and 14 respectively. Generally, when selectivity in 6-aminohexanenitrile increases, that in 1,6-hexanediamine decreases and vice versa. Also, 1.6-hexanediamine is usually obtained together with certain amounts of azacycloheptane, both of which seem to be produced on different active centres than 6-aminohexanenitrile. In order to know more about the nature of the active sites involved in this reaction, an in-depth characterization of the catalytic surfaces is in progress. References 1 K. Weissermel and H. J.
