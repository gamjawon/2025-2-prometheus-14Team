Faculty of Metallurgical and Energy Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology Kunming 650093 PR China Producing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrochemically is a possible alternative to industrial anthraquinone synthesis. Herein, α-MoO 3−x catalysts with controllable oxygen vacancies for two-electron Oxygen Reduction (2e− ORR) electrocatalysis have been reported for the first time. Because of the finely tuned oxygen vacancy concentration of α-MoO3−x-400, it is particularly sensitive to the production of H2O2, providing very high selectivity in H2O2 production reaches as high as 93% with an average yield of 310 mmol gcat −1 h−1 over 12 h. In addition to providing us with the most abundant and attractive transition metal oxide (TMO) catalysts yet, this research provides a fresh approach to the rational development of effective TMO catalysts. Graphical Abstract ga1 Keywords 2e− oxygen reduction reaction Hydrogen peroxide Oxygen vacancy concentration α-MoO3 Data Availability Data will be made available on request. 1 Introduction The wide application of hydrogen peroxide in wastewater treatment, disinfection, pulp manufacturing and chemical synthesis make it one of the most valuable oxidants.[1–3] The escalating global H2O2 demand will rise to 6000 kilotons in 2024.[4] At present, more than 95% of H2O2 is produced by the anthraquinone process, which consumes energy and materials intensively. The anthraquinone process uses expensive palladium catalysts to indirectly hydrogenate 2- alkylanthraquinone. In addition, the storage and transportation of a high concentration of H2O2 produced by the anthraquinone process bring serious security risks.[5] In recent years, the electrochemical synthesis of H2O2 by 2e− ORR transfer process has attracted extensive attention in academia and industry.[6] Compared with the traditional anthraquinone methods, its advantages include mild reaction conditions at ambient temperature and pressure, input of renewable energy without CO2 emissions, high-energy conversion efficiency, and green precursors such as air and water.[7] Since O2 can also be completely reduced to H2O through the 4e− ORR transfer process, which is the preferred route for fuel cell applications. Therefore, the development of high selectivity and activity 2e− ORR catalysts is the prerequisite for this sustainable synthesis route.[8] Nobel-metal-based catalysts including precious metals and their alloys have shown high selectivity for 2e− ORR.[9] Although precious metals are expensive and scarce, they will be difficult to deploy in large quantities in the future.[10] Furthermore, carbon-based catalysts,[11] which include reduced graphene oxide materials, nitrogen and oxygen doped carbon materials and some nonmetallic doped carbon materials,[12] perform well. However, the stability of carbon catalysts in H2O2 solutions with strong oxidation may exist.[13] Therefore, the low-cost and high-stability transition metal oxides, such as Fe3O4,[14] CeO2,[15] Ta2O5,[16] Nb2O5 [17] and VxOy,[18] have become research hotspots. The catalytic activity of transition metal oxides can be further improved by modifying the support or introducing heteroatoms, and the crystal plane effect has also made good progress in recent years. Although the research on transition metal oxides has been carried out step by step, there are still the following problems due to the current research: (1) the intrinsic activity of transition metal oxides is not reported enough; (2) there is no definite production of hydrogen peroxide; (3) there are few reports on the electronic structure and oxygen concentration of metal oxide surface interface; (4) the application of the crystal structure of metal oxides in the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction has not been clearly reported at present. Therefore, it is very necessary to solve the internal structure-activity relationship of metal oxides by using the good conductivity and excellent stability of metal oxides and the adjustability of the oxygen vacancy state on the surface, which is of great significance to explore the role of oxygen in transition metal oxides and the preparation of hydrogen peroxide by ORR method [19]. MoO3 as a non-toxic, environmentally friendly, low-cost and highly stable catalyst[20] is widely used as an electrocatalyst, supercapacitor, batteries made of lithium-ion, and electrocatalysis.[21,22] The orthogonal α-MoO3 shows hierarchical structure, which is composed of by superimposing MoO6 octahedral double-layer sheets vis. Van der Waals forces.[23] This structure is intensively investigated as an electrocatalyst because it is capable of removing and introducing tiny ions.[24] Previous studies have shown that molybdenum oxide-based compounds can exhibit excellent performance in oxygen evolution reaction (OER), [25–27] lithium-ion battery, supercapacitor and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) through the introduction of metal atoms,[28–30] the loading of graphene oxide[31] and the regulation of crystal structure,[25] which have attracted great attention. According to literature reports, there is no research on the intrinsic activity of 2e− ORR of MoO3, and no one has used oxygen vacancy strategy to adjust the oxygen structure in MoO3. In this study, MoO3 showed excellent selectivity to catalyze 2e− ORR by introducing oxygen vacancies and the surface oxygen vacancy concentration was finely controlled. In alkaline medium, when the oxygen vacancy concentration reaches 28%, the selectivity of α-MoO 3−x -400 to produce H2O2 is as high as 93%, and an average yield is 310 mmol gcat −1 h−1 over 12 h. 2 Experimental sections 2.1 Synthesis of orthorhombic (α-MoO3) 1.4 g H24Mo7N6O24·4 H2O and 0.05 g CTAB were mixed in 40 mL HNO3/H2O (1:5, volume ratio) solution and stirred magnetically for 30 min at room temperature. After that, the solution was placed in a 50 mL autoclave composed of Teflon-linked stainless steel and heated to 200 °C for 20 h. The suspension was obtained by repeatedly cleaning with distilled water and ethanol. The obtained precipitates were dried in a drying oven at 80 ℃ for 12 h, and finally, the mixture was ground into a fine powder and named α-MoO 3 . 2.2 Synthesis of orthorhombic with O vacancy (α-MoO3−x) The α-MoO 3 was partially pyrolyzed in a tubular furnace at 300 °C, 350 °C and 400 °C with a heating rate of 5 ℃/min in an atmosphere of argon and hydrogen for 2 h. The pyrolysis samples were termed as α-MoO 3−x -300, α-MoO 3−x -350, α-MoO 3−x -400 and α-MoO 3−x -500, respectively. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization As can be seen in Fig. 1 a, the XRD of the synthesized α-MoO3 and α-MoO 3−x samples have the same characteristic diffraction peaks (α-MoO 3 phase, JCPDS No. 05–0508).[32] The phase crystallizes in the layered MoO6 octahedron structure by sharing the pyramids, which indicates that the α-MoO3 structure has been successfully prepared, and the consistent crystal structure has been completely maintained at high temperature. Among them, the crystallinity of α-MoO 3−x -350, α-MoO 3−x -400 and α-MoO 3−x -500 is obviously lower than that of α-MoO 3 , which may be due to the formation of oxygen vacancies by calcination in a hydrogen atmosphere at high temperature.[21] As we know, when calcining in an anoxic environment, the non-stoichiometric phenomenon will occur due to the difference of oxygen atom concentration between samples and calcination atmosphere and temperature, and oxygen vacancy will be introduced into α-MoO3 lattice, resulting in oxygen depletion.[33] As shown in Fig. 1 b and Table S1, the dominant (040) lattice space of the α-MoO 3−x samples expands with the increase of pyrolysis temperature. Theoretically, Na-Phattalung et al.[34] and Lee et al.[35] predicted that the α-MoO3 lattice's oxygen deficiency would cause Mo atoms to shift outward, cementing the bonding of Mo-O and Mo-Mo bonds. Santara et al. also noted that the presence of oxygen vacancies caused a comparable lattice expansion in pure TiO2.[36] It is reasonable to assume that the synthesized α-MoO3−x sample contains a specific number of oxygen vacancies, and that when the calcination temperature rises, the oxygen vacancy concentration in the α-MoO3 matrix increases. The morphology of the α-MoO3 and α-MoO 3−x samples is depicted in the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) pictures in Fig. 1 c-d and Figs. S1–2. Close observation shows that the original α-MoO3 has a uniform nanorod structure and smooth surface. These nanorods possess a wide of 200–300 nm, a length of 5–10 µm and the thickness of about 50 nm. After hydrogen reduction treatment, α-MoO 3−x maintained its initial morphology and size. Additionally, photos taken with a transmission electron microscope (TEM) reveal that the morphologies of α-MoO3 and α-MoO3−x-400 are similar. Fig. 1 e displays stripes of ordered lattice. The lattice stripe in Fig. 1 f, which is consistent with the XRD study and attests to the high degree of retention of the α-MoO3 crystal structure, has a interval of 0.35 nm for the (040) plane.[20] In addition, the obvious disordered pore structure (Fig. 1 e and S3) can be observed in TEM of α-MoO 3−x -400, which may be due to the oxygen vacancy defects produced by hydrogen reduction at high temperature. Furthermore, the EDS mapping image verified the existence of Mo and O elements and their uniform distribution in α-MoO 3−x -400 sample (Fig. S4 a-c). The BET method was used to analyze the produced catalysts for investigate the specific surface area of α-MoO3. These five catalysts pore size distributions and N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were computed. Fig. 1 g shows that when the p/p0 ratio is 0.80–1, the adsorption-desorption curves of the five catalysts all belong to the type IV isotherm of H3 hysteresis loop.[37] Through BJH pore size analysis in Fig. 1 h and Table S2, all these catalysts have obvious mesoporous structures. This may be beneficial to promote the permeation of O2 and electrolyte, and improve its ORR activity [38,39]. The valence states of molybdenum and oxygen were examined by XPS to establish the presence of oxygen vacancies. XPS spectra for all of the synthesized samples showed the coexistence of Mo and O elements (Figs. S5-S9), which were in good agreement with EDS measurement results (Fig. S4 a-c). The high-resolution Mo 3d XPS spectra for pure α-MoO3 and hydrogen reduced α-MoO 3−x samples may be deconvolved into a strong Mo6+ and a somewhat faint Mo5+ bimodal. The Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 of Mo6+ for α-MoO3 could be responsible for the doublet at 232.80 and 235.93 eV, respectively ( Fig. 2 a).[39,40] Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 are responsible for the doublet near 231.90 eV and 234.70 eV when the hydrogen reduction temperature rises (Fig. 2 b-e). This indicates that oxygen vacancies have been successfully formed in α-MoO 3−x by reducing in hydrogen atmosphere at chosen temperatures.[21] Three peaks at 530.50, 531.00, and 531.57 eV can be apportioned to the lattice O (OL), oxygen vacancy (Ov), and chemically adsorbed oxygen on surface (OC), respectively, in the O 1 s spectrum (Fig. 2 f–j).[21] The atomic ratio of Mo5+/Mo6+ steadily rises with rising temperature, and the amount of oxygen vacancies also rises gradually. The concentration of oxygen vacancies reaches its highest value of 36.6% when the atomic ratio of Mo5+/Mo6+ hits 0.137. According to the XPS O1s peak fitting, the proportion of oxygen vacancies gradually rises as the hydrogenation temperature rises (Fig. S10). Finally, it can be seen from the Fig. 2 k of the relationship between the percentage content of Mo5+/Mo6+ and oxygen vacancy content that the oxygen vacancy concentration also increases with the increase of Mo5+ content. These results clearly show that α-MoO 3−x forms a large amount of OV in the synthesis process. As a result of EPR measurements, the hydrogen reduction temperature was confirmed as a factor affecting the concentration of surface oxygen vacancies as well as their properties were identified. As can be seen from Fig. 3 a, all samples exhibit electron paramagnetic resonance spectra showing a 2.003 g value as indicated by the EPR spectra, which is located at the vacancy center of ionized oxygen. EPR characteristic peak and the quantity of oxygen vacancies on the surface are positively correlated.[41] In the absence of hydrogen reduction, only a small EPR signal peak appears in α-MoO3. However, with the increase of hydrogen reduction temperature, an obvious EPR signal peak appears, which indicates that the oxygen vacancy content on the surface increased gradually as the temperature increases, which further confirms the change of oxygen vacancy content by TEM analysis and XPS. After high-temperature treatment under hydrogen condition, the color of the oxide changes with the reduction degree, and the color changes from off-white to blue-black, as shown in Fig. S11. Ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–vis) can further indicate the existence of oxygen vacancies (Fig. S12a). A strong absorption at wavelengths between 325 and 800 nm can be attributed to α-MoO3−x-400, due to the increase in oxygen vacancies caused by hydrogen reduction.[42,43] The bandgap energy of α-MoO3、α-MoO 3−x -300、α-MoO 3−x -350 and α-MoO 3−x -400 (Figs. S12b -e) were 2.98、2.90、2.86 and 2.88, respectively, which was lower than that of commercial α-MoO3(3.34 eV).[44] This result showed that the intrinsic conductivity of α-MoO 3−x is significantly increased, which was conducive to improving the reactivity of 2e− ORR.[45]. In addition, the area enclosed by the spectral absorption peak is proportional to the number of spins in the measured sample, and the percentage of oxygen vacancy in the measured sample can be quantitatively analyzed by measuring the area enclosed by the spectral absorption peak. As shown in Fig. 3 b and Table S3, with the increase of hydrogen reduction temperature, the area surrounded by spectral absorption peaks also gradually increases, which manifests that the content of oxygen vacancies also gradually increases. It is found that the percentage of oxygen vacancy in α-MoO3 is close to the same as that of XPS analysis. Through the quantitative analysis of XPS and EPR, we can also find that the change of oxygen vacancy concentration is consistent in a certain temperature range, which further proves that the change of oxygen vacancy concentration by hydrogen reduction temperature is obvious. 3.2 Performance test Using 200 µg cm−2 as a catalyst, the ORR catalytic performance of α-MoO3 and α-MoO 3−x in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte was assessed on RRDE. Notably, the RRDE electrode (bare glassy carbon) had a very low catalytic action in the absence of a catalyst ( Fig. S13 ), which was nearly consistent with other research.[10] Additionally, the collection efficiency (N) was calculated in detail and found to be 0.365 following calibration in potassium ferricyanide solution (see Fig. S14). To assess the oxygen reduction activity of the synthesis catalyst, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed ( Fig. 4 a). The five α-MoO3 catalysts can be seen to have clear oxygen reduction peaks in an O2 saturated electrolyte, which disappear in a N2 saturated solution, demonstrating clear ORR catalytic activity. At a scanning rate of 10 mV s1, Fig. 4 b displays the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) of the α-MoO 3 electrocatalyst together with the disk and ring current densities. Both the disk electrode's and the ring electrode's onset potentials are at 0.68 V vs. RHE, demonstrating that α-MoO 3 possesses strong oxygen reduction activity. As shown in Fig. 4 c, α-MoO 3−x -400 showed a selectivity of about 93% in the potential range of 0.1–0.6 V vs. RHE, which was higher than that of α-MoO3 by about 11%. Meanwhile, α-MoO 3−x -300 and α-MoO 3−x -350 showed 2e− ORR selectivity of about 85%. In addition, in the ORR process, the number of electrons transferred (n) of α-MoO 3 , α-MoO 3−x -300, α-MoO 3−x -350, α-MoO 3−x -400 and α-MoO 3−x -500 were about 2.36, 2.30, 2.31, 2.14 and 2.34, respectively (Fig. 4 d), which supported the 2e− ORR path of each catalyst. According to the analysis of double-layer capacitances (Cdl) (Fig. S15), α-MoO3 shows the highest specific surface area, but its selectivity and activity do not show obvious advantages. There is no obvious difference in the specific surface area of the α-MoO 3−x catalysts after hydrogen reduction treatment, which is almost consistent with the conclusion of BET, indicating that the specific surface area may not be the main factor leading to the performance difference. 3.3 Stability test Further electrochemical tests showed that α-MoO 3−x -400 exhibited high Faraday efficiency of about 87% in the potential range of 0.1–0.6 V vs. RHE, which was much higher than that of α-MoO3 (69%), α-MoO 3−x -300 (74%), α-MoO 3−x -350 (74%) and α-MoO 3−x -500 (71%) (Fig. S16). The long-term stability of α-MoO 3−x -400 was measured by chronovoltammetry at − 0.4 V vs. RHE. The comparison of LSV curves obtained in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte that was O2 and N2-saturated significantly revealed that α-Mo 3−x -400 had a high oxygen reduction capacity ( Fig. 5 a). After 12 h of the electrochemical test, the current density of α-Mo 3−x -400 shows a slight increase due to the increase in the H2O2 concentration that leads to the shift of the Nernst equation.[46] Compared with α-MoO3, α-MoO 3−x -300, α-MoO 3−x- 350 and α-MoO 3−x -500 (Figs. S17-20), which has the best stability and keeps the highest initial current. It proves that α-MoO 3−x -400 is stable in alkaline electrolyte containing H2O2 for a long time. Additionally, a two-chamber H-cell with 0.1 M KOH electrolyte was used for the experiment to produce H2O2 using electrocatalysis. The accumulation concentration of H2O2 was determined by the ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry of cerium sulfate (Ce(SO4)2) (Supplementary Information Figs. S21–22).[46] α-MoO 3−x -400 has the accumulated H2O2 concentration of 38 mM within 12 h electrochemical test and an average yield of 310 mmol gcat −1 h−1, which was approximately linear with the reaction time (Fig. 5 b). Furthermore, Fig. 5 c clearly showed that the XRD of α-MoO 3−x -400 was consistent with the initial state after 12-hour electrochemical test, which indicates that the structure of α-MoO 3−x -400 has not changed before and through long-term electrochemical test. Furthermore, the morphology of α-MoO 3−x -400 obtained after the durability test was studied by TEM (Fig. 5 d-e and S23), The shape of α-MoO 3−x -400 nanorods is stable after the long-term electrochemical test, and the HRTEM images further showed the same lattice stripe characteristics like the initial α-MoO 3−x -400. These results suggest that the α-MoO 3−x -400 catalyst has good durability under ORR process conditions. It is worth to notice that the 2e− ORR selectivity of the α-MoO 3−x -400 catalyst is better than that of the most robust catalysts and even the noble metal catalysts such as Pt-Hg[47] and Au-Pt-Ni[48] (Fig. 5 f and Table S4), thus it is listed as one of the intentional non-noble metal 2e− ORR catalysts. 3.4 Discussion The association between the creation of oxygen vacancies and the selectivity of H2O2 was further examined, we calculated the percentage change of oxygen vacancies. As shown in Fig. 6 a-b, α-MoO3, which was not reduced by hydrogen at high temperature, showed a weak oxygen vacancy concentration. The selectivity and average yield of H2O2 increased with the increase of the oxygen vacancy concentration. It can be seen that the high-temperature hydrogen reduction treatment changes the concentration of oxygen vacancies, and the selectivity and average yield of H2O2 shows a volcanic trend. When the reduction temperature is 400 ℃, the 2e− ORR selectivity of α-MoO 3−x -400 showed the best, reaching 93%, which shows that the addition of oxygen vacancy is advantageous for the development of 2e− ORR. The 2e− ORR selectivity decreased as the hydrogenation temperature rose to 500 °C. In the adsorption of tiny molecules like oxygen[49], water[50], nitric oxide[51] and small hydrocarbons, α-MoO3 is typically thought to be electrochemically inert, indicating that the contact between the adsorbate and stoichiometric MoO3 surface is a typical weak Van der Waals interaction.[52] However, the exist of oxygen vacancies increases the adsorption and reactivity of oxygen molecules at these defect sites due to the insufficient coordination of Mo atoms caused by the lack of oxygen on the surface (Fig. 6 c). When the oxygen vacancy concentration reaches 28%, the selectivity of α-MoO 3−x -400 to H2O2 reaches 93%. Therefore, a reasonable control of the oxygen vacancy concentration of α-MoO3 can further improve the 2e− ORR electrocatalysis performance [53]. 4 Conclusions In summary, α-MoO3−x with controllable oxygen vacancies was finely fabricated and demonstrated as an efficient and stable 2e− ORR catalyst. Under the conditions of 0.4 V vs. RHE, the catalyst has a high selectivity of over 93% and Faraday efficiency of 87%, which is better than most 2e− ORR catalysts. According to the structure analysis, the high selectivity of α-MoO3 is attributed to the introduction of oxygen vacancies. With the increase of oxygen vacancy concentration, the α-MoO3−x catalysts shows the volcano trend of the selectivity and H2O2 yield. Our findings may be of great significance to explore the rich and efficient 2e− ORR catalysts for the future.

        "dc:description": "Producing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrochemically is a possible alternative to industrial anthraquinone synthesis. Herein, α-MoO 3−x catalysts with controllable oxygen vacancies for two-electron Oxygen Reduction (2e− ORR) electrocatalysis have been reported for the first time. Because of the finely tuned oxygen vacancy concentration of α-MoO3−x-400, it is particularly sensitive to the production of H2O2, providing very high selectivity in H2O2 production reaches as high as 93% with an average yield of 310 mmol gcat −1 h−1 over 12 h. In addition to providing us with the most abundant and attractive transition metal oxide (TMO) catalysts yet, this research provides a fresh approach to the rational development of effective TMO catalysts.",
