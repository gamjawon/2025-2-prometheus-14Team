Graphical abstract The limited carrier separation efficiency in conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) remains a critical constraint for their photocatalytic performance. Recognizing the built-in electric field (BEF) as a crucial kinetic factor for promoting photoinduced carrier separation and migration, we developed a BEF intensification strategy through asymmetric extension of monomer conjugation systems. A series of CMPs were rationally designed and synthesized via metal-free Chichibabin reactions, featuring systematically varied π-conjugated architectures. Combined experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate that asymmetric expansion of monomer π-conjugation effectively enhances the BEF intensity through optimized molecular polarization, thereby promoting directional charge separation and transport. This BEF enhancement enables efficient photocatalytic CH trifluoromethylation of diverse bioactive heterocyclic compounds under visible light irradiation, achieving exceptional catalytic yields up to 98 %. Our findings establish fundamental correlations between asymmetric conjugation engineering and the BEF optimization, providing valuable insights for molecular-level design of high-performance polymeric photocatalysts.

Inspired by natural photosynthesis, metal-free organic semiconductor photocatalysis offers a promising solution by converting solar energy into storable chemical energy, thereby addressing pressing energy and environmental concerns [2–4]. Among various organic photocatalysts, conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) have emerged as highly promising candidates due to their extended frameworks, excellent chemical stability, and broad visible-light absorption [5–7]. However, the low dielectric constant of CMPs leads to rapid electron-hole recombination, significantly limiting their photocatalytic efficiency [8]. Overcoming this limitation is essential for advancing the development of high-performance CMP-based photocatalysts. The construction of built-in electric fields (BEFs) within semiconductors facilitates exciton dissociation into free electron-hole pairs, thereby significantly enhancing carrier separation in photocatalytic systems [9–11]. Driven by the BEF, photogenerated holes and electrons migrate in opposite directions, which markedly accelerates exciton separation. Crucially, as the driving force for exciton dissociation, BEFs enable superior photocatalytic performance, with their driving capability quantifiable through dipole moment measurements. Although BEFs may arise from charge distribution asymmetry caused by externally applied forces [12,13], non-centrosymmetric structures [14,15], Fermi level differences or surface state variations [16], the obscure relationship between modification strategies and catalytic activity has limited the effectiveness of these approaches for strengthening BEFs [17]. Recently, porous polymeric catalysts have been reported to offer a promising alternative. By systematically tailoring their molecular structures, these materials can modulate intramolecular dipole moments, thereby influencing internal charge distributions. This capability provides a novel and effective strategy for enhancing BEFs [18,19]. Previous studies have demonstrated that donor (D)-acceptor (A) composite architectures in CMPs represent an effective strategy for achieving large dipole moments [20–23]. Conventional acceptor units such as benzothiazole derivatives [24], aryl triazines [25], perylene diimides [19] and bipyridines [26] have been incorporated into CMP frameworks to overcome the strong intrinsic Coulomb interactions of excitons and promote their separation. However, the prevalent symmetric structures in most reported D-A CMP photocatalysts compromise material polarity, thereby diminishing the BEF and minimizing its influence on charge separation and transport effects. This critical limitation underscores the urgent need for developing effective strategies to enhance the BEF, thereby optimizing charge separation and transfer in D-A CMP systems. In this work, two pyridine-based CMPs with distinct conjugated linkers, Ph-CMP and NaPh-CMP, were synthesized (Scheme 1 ). Through precise modulation of monomer conjugation structures in CMPs, this study achieves controlled structural asymmetry, systematically optimizing the BEF and consequently enhancing photocatalytic performance in trifluoromethylation of heteroaromatic compounds. Experimental results demonstrate that asymmetric conjugation extension increases dipole moments, intensifies the BEF, prolongs carrier lifetime, suppresses electron-hole recombination, enhances photocurrent response, reduces impedance, while maintaining appropriate exciton binding energy. Furthermore, conjugation extension regulates band structures to facilitate CF3SO2Na activation. Compared to Ph-CMP, NaPh-CMP exhibits superior catalytic efficiency. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparations 1,4-diacetylbenzene (2 mmol), terephthalaldehyde (1 mmol) and ammonium acetate (2.31 g, 30 mmol) were added sequentially in a 100 mL round bottom flask, followed by pyridine (35 mL), and the reaction was carried out at 115 °C for 8 h. After the reaction, the solvent was removed by filtration, and the remaining solid was washed with deionized water and chloroform in sequence. Then, the solid was dried at 60 °C for 72 h to obtain final powders (Ph-CMP). The synthesis of NaPh-CMP was carried out using 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxaldehyde as the starting material, with all other procedures identical to those described previously. (Scheme 1). 2.2 Light initiated trifluoromethylation of arenes To a flame-dried 10 mL reaction vial equipped with a magnetic stir bar was charged with CMPs, arenes, CF3SO2Na and DMSO. The vial was sealed with Parafilm. And then the reaction mixture was irradiated with 30 W blue LEDs for 24 h (around 35 °C). The reaction mixture was quenched with water and extracted with ethyl acetate three times. The combined organic layers were dried with MgSO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The crude material was purified by flash chromatography to afford the products. 2.3 Characterizations The details of the characterizations and the NMR data of the products were provided in the supporting information. 3 Results and discussion Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the CMPs exhibit two prominent absorption bands within the 1750–1500 cm−1 range, corresponding to vibrational modes of benzene and pyridine rings, respectively. A weaker band near 3000 cm−1 arises from CH stretching vibrations of residual methyl groups (Fig. 1 a) [27]. Complementarily, Solid-state 13C cross polarization/magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (13C CP/MAS NMR) analysis confirms the polymer structure, where the characteristic signal at 130–150 ppm verifies CN bond formation. Additional carbon environments are identified: signals at 20–30 ppm and 180–200 ppm are assigned to formyl carbons, while aromatic carbons resonate between 128–147 ppm (Fig. 1b) [28]. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) further corroborates these findings, revealing well-defined C1s and N1s peaks that definitively confirm pyridine ring incorporation (Figs. S1, S2). Moreover, Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with elemental mapping illustrates homogeneous distribution of C and N across both catalysts, providing direct evidence for the successful synthesis of Ph-CMP and NaPh-CMP (Fig. 1d–e). Collectively, these spectroscopic and microscopic results conclusively demonstrate the construction of the desired conjugated frameworks via thermal cyclization reactions. Physical characterization confirms that the synthesized CMPs exhibit properties favorable for photocatalytic applications. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis reveals well-defined porosity in both materials, with NaPh-CMP demonstrating a substantially higher specific surface area (426.6 m2/g) than Ph-CMP (355.3 m2/g), consistent with theoretical predictions (Fig. 1c). Moreover, Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) morphological examination indicates that both CMPs adopt spherical architectures, while Powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns unequivocally confirm their amorphous nature (Figs. S4–S5) [29,30]. Following confirmation of successful material synthesis, Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) was employed to evaluate the surface potential distribution of the photocatalysts and its evolution under illumination (Fig. 2 a–f). The Contact potential difference (ΔCPD) between the probe and photocatalyst directly quantifies the built-in electric field (BEF) intensity. Specifically, Ph-CMP exhibits a ΔCPD of 3 mV, whereas NaPh-CMP demonstrates a significantly higher value of 40 mV. Notably, upon irradiation, both CMPs show enhanced surface potentials relative to their dark states, with NaPh-CMP displaying markedly greater enhancement than Ph-CMP. Critically, the substantially elevated ΔCPD of NaPh-CMP compared to Ph-CMP indicates that the introduced asymmetric naphthalene ring architecture facilitates a stronger BEF, thereby markedly improving the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. This conclusion is further corroborated by Electrostatic potential (ESP) mapping, which reveals distinct negative potential regions localized at pyridine rings and adjacent benzene moieties, while positive potentials predominantly accumulate on naphthalene units (Fig. 2g, h). Quantitatively, NaPh-CMP exhibits a 2.8-fold larger dipole moment (0.1684 Debye) than Ph-CMP (0.0604 Debye), directly evidencing that extending the asymmetric π-conjugated system effectively enhances molecular polarity. Consequently, this dipole moment amplification substantially strengthens the BEF. To elucidate the structure–property relationships influenced by conjugation effects, we conducted comprehensive investigations of charge transfer dynamics using Transient photocurrent response measurements and Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Fig. 3 a-b). Our systematic analysis revealed a distinct dependence of charge transfer characteristics on the degree of linker conjugation, with NaPh-CMP demonstrating superior performance metrics. Specifically, this material exhibited significantly enhanced photocurrent intensity, substantially reduced charge transfer resistance, and improved charge separation efficiency − all of which can be directly attributed to its strengthened BEF resulting from extended asymmetric π-conjugation. For deeper understanding, we performed Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and steady-state Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopic analyses. The TRPL measurements clearly showed that NaPh-CMP possesses a markedly longer average carrier lifetime (2.18 ns) compared to Ph-CMP (1.12 ns) (Fig. 3c), providing direct evidence for more efficient charge separation in the former system. Complementary temperature-dependent fluorescence spectroscopy studies quantitatively determined the exciton binding energies to be 59 meV for Ph-CMP and 66 meV for NaPh-CMP (Fig. 3d–f) [31]. The higher binding energy observed in NaPh-CMP reflects enhanced exciton stability and consequently suppressed charge recombination. Collectively, these experimental results unambiguously demonstrate that the enhanced BEF in NaPh-CMP, arising from its extended asymmetric π-conjugation architecture, effectively promotes charge carrier separation and significantly prolongs exciton lifetime relative to its less conjugated Ph-CMP counterpart. The trifluoromethylation reaction represents a powerful transformation that can effectively modulate both pKa values and lipid solubility of organic molecules, making it particularly valuable for pharmaceutical chemistry and materials science research [32,33]. Given the ubiquitous presence of CH bonds in organic compounds, developing efficient and atom-economical methods for direct CH trifluoromethylation is of great importance [34–36]. In this context, photocatalytic CH trifluoromethylation strategies have attracted considerable attention due to their mild reaction conditions and high efficiency [37–46]. From a mechanistic standpoint, photocatalytic CH trifluoromethylation proceeds through photogenerated charge carrier-mediated redox processes, which facilitate fluoroalkyl radical formation and subsequent reduction steps [47,48]. The reaction kinetics are predominantly governed by the charge separation and migration efficiency within the photocatalytic system. Based on these fundamental principles, we hypothesized that strengthening the BEF could enhance photogenerated charge separation and promote directional charge migration, potentially leading to efficient photocatalytic CH trifluoromethylation. Our experimental results confirmed this hypothesis, with the optimized catalytic performance demonstrating satisfactory efficiency across various substrates (Table S1). An in-depth investigation of the reaction mechanism commenced with characterization of the band structure properties of pyridine-based CMPs. Ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) spectroscopy reveals that NaPh-CMP exhibits substantially enhanced visible-light absorption relative to Ph-CMP, with an absorption edge extending to 700 nm (Fig. 4 a). This observation aligns with experiments where substituting NaPh-CMP with Ph-CMP under standard conditions resulted in significantly diminished reaction yields. Furthermore, variations in illumination conditions profoundly impacted catalytic performance: irradiation with 24 W blue light (450–460 nm) afforded the target product in 30 % yield using NaPh-CMP, whereas green light (530–540 nm) reduced the yield to 5 %. Under 24 W white light (380–850 nm), only 10 % yield was obtained. Collectively, these results indicate that extending the asymmetric conjugated structure narrows the catalyst bandgap, promotes electron excitation, and enhances visible-light photocatalytic conversion. To gain further mechanistic insights, systematic scavenger experiments employing various quenchers were conducted: copper chloride (CuCl2) for trapping photogenerated electrons (e−), potassium iodide (KI) for scavenging holes (h+), benzoquinone (BQ) for quenching superoxide radicals (O2 −), and tert-butanol (t-BuOH) for eliminating hydroxyl radicals. Yield analysis demonstrated significant suppression upon addition of CuCl2 or KI compared to the scavenger-free control. Similarly, depletion of O2 − substantially diminished the yield, while t-BuOH exerted only a marginal effect. Critically, the successful trapping of product 4 using radical scavenger 1,1-diphenylethylene under optimized conditions confirmed the presence of CF3 radicals. These findings collectively establish the active involvement of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, with CF3 and O2 − serving as essential intermediates in the photooxidation process. Control experiments established that the reaction failed to proceed in the absence of either light irradiation or the CMP photocatalyst, providing clear evidence that the transformation is genuinely light-driven and that the CMP catalyst plays an indispensable role in facilitating the reaction (Fig. 4b). Subsequently, disparities between the two catalysts were further elucidated. Tauc plot analysis determined optical band gaps (Fig. S6), while Mott-Schottky measurements confirmed conduction band positions (Fig. S7). Notably, both CMPs possess sufficient thermodynamic driving force for CF3SO2Na reduction (oxidation potential: 1.05 V vs. SCE) (Fig. 4c). Moreover, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy verified the generation of oxygen and trifluoromethyl radicals in both systems, with NaPh-CMP exhibiting markedly intensified signal intensities (Fig. 4d–e) [47]. In situ infrared spectroscopy analysis following 60 min of adsorption of 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene and CF3SO2Na on CMP revealed characteristic vibrational signatures through comparison with the WUJING database (https://www.basechem.org) (Fig. 4f–g). Distinct peaks corresponding to CO stretching vibrations of aromatic ether (1021 and 1252 cm−1), CH stretching vibrations of benzene rings (2903 and 2983 cm−1) and CF stretching vibration of CF3SO2Na (1046 cm−1) were clearly identified. Upon light excitation, significant changes in vibrational intensities indicated the occurrence of radical addition processes involving 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene. The CO stretching vibrations shifted from 1021 to 1058 cm−1 and from 1252 to 1286 cm−1, while the CF stretching vibration shifted from 1046 to 1106 cm−1. In contrast, the CH stretching vibrations at 2903 and 2983 cm−1 showed minimal displacement. Additional spectral evidence emerged with the appearance of a new band at 1333 cm−1, assigned to the SO stretching vibration of SO2. Time-dependent spectral evolution demonstrated progressive intensity increases for peaks at 1058, 1286, 1106, and 1333 cm−1, accompanied by gradual decreases in the benzene ring CH stretching vibrations at 2903 and 2983 cm−1. The observed vibrational shifts in CF stretching modes (1058 and 1286 cm−1) and the emergence of the SO stretching vibration (1333 cm−1) provide direct spectroscopic evidence for CF3SO2Na decomposition generating CF3 • during the reaction. Concurrent attenuation of benzene ring CH stretching vibrations (2903 and 2983 cm−1) under illumination confirmed successful CF3 • addition to the aromatic system. Based on these experimental observations, a photocatalytic trifluoromethylation mechanism was established (Fig. 4h). The proposed pathway involves light-induced electron excitation from the valence band (VB) to conduction band (CB) of NaPh-CMP, generating electron-hole pairs. Photogenerated holes mediate oxidation of CF3SO2Na to produce CF3 • radicals, which subsequently add to the substrate forming intermediate A. This intermediate undergoes hydrogen migration to generate carbon radical intermediate B, which is ultimately oxidized by reactive oxygen species (O2 •−) to yield the final product. To evaluate the synthetic applicability of this catalytic strategy, the substrate scope was systematically investigated using NaPh-CMP as the photocatalyst (Fig. 5 ). Under optimized reaction conditions, aromatic compounds bearing substituents underwent efficient trifluoromethylation, affording the corresponding products in excellent yields (94–95 %, 3a–b). Significantly, the catalytic system demonstrated remarkable versatility towards diverse heteroaromatic substrates including thiophene, furan, pyrimidine, and pyrrole derivatives, delivering trifluoromethylation products in moderate to good yields (64–89 %, 3c–g). The reaction exhibited excellent functional group tolerance, as evidenced by the successful transformation of both electron-rich pyrimidine derivatives and electron-deficient pyrrole compounds with comparable efficiency (80–82 %, 3f–g). Notably, the protocol proved particularly effective for indole substrates, where indoles were smoothly converted to the desired products in excellent yields (81–85 % for products 3h–i). The synthetic utility was further demonstrated through successful trifluoromethylation of biologically relevant molecules. Both hormone derivatives and amino acid analogs participated effectively in the transformation, providing access to valuable trifluoromethylation compounds in moderate to good yields (55–76 %, 3j–o). More importantly, this strategy enabled direct trifluoromethylation of various bioactive xanthine alkaloids, including caffeine, doxofylline, theobromine, and pentoxifylline, underscoring the potential of highly conjugated CMPs in pharmaceutical development and drug candidate modification. 4 Conclusions In summary, this study developed a BEF enhancement strategy in CMPs through naphthyl linker incorporation. The extension of asymmetric π-conjugated systems reduces material symmetry while amplifying the BEF, which significantly facilitates charge separation/migration. This structural modification enables efficient transition-metal-free trifluoromethylation of diverse heterocyclic compounds, including bioactive molecules. These significant findings establish fundamental molecular-level design principles that advance the development of high-performance functional materials for photocatalytic applications, while simultaneously providing an environmentally benign approach to valuable chemical transformations. The demonstrated methodology represents an important step forward in the rational design of metal-free polymeric photocatalysts with tailored electronic and interfacial properties.

        "dc:description": "The limited carrier separation efficiency in conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) remains a critical constraint for their photocatalytic performance. Recognizing the built-in electric field (BEF) as a crucial kinetic factor for promoting photoinduced carrier separation and migration, we developed a BEF intensification strategy through asymmetric extension of monomer conjugation systems. A series of CMPs were rationally designed and synthesized via metal-free Chichibabin reactions, featuring systematically varied π-conjugated architectures. Combined experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate that asymmetric expansion of monomer π-conjugation effectively enhances the BEF intensity through optimized molecular polarization, thereby promoting directional charge separation and transport. This BEF enhancement enables efficient photocatalytic CH trifluoromethylation of diverse bioactive heterocyclic compounds under visible light irradiation, achieving exceptional catalytic yields up to 98 %. Our findings establish fundamental correlations between asymmetric conjugation engineering and the BEF optimization, providing valuable insights for molecular-level design of high-performance polymeric photocatalysts.",
