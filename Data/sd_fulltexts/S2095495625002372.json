(b) The structural models of TMH-NGDY (4-coordinated, H-site) and TML-NGDY (2-coordinated, L-site) with the corresponding TM elements. (c) The most stable adsorption energy for N2 on TML/H-NGDY. Fig. 2 (a) The reaction mechanism diagram of NRR illustrating four pathways: distal, alternating, consecutive, and enzymatic. Additionally, it depicts two modes of N2 adsorption: end-on and side-on. (b) Free energy changes for the first and the last hydrogenation step of NRR. (c) U L of HER and NRR for 11 TML/H-NGDY SACs, simultaneously comparing the performance with several other SACs in previous studies, including TM@GDY, TMB@GY, TM-BN-G, and TM-B-GY. (d, e) Gibbs free energy diagrams for MoL-NGDY and NbL-NGDY that exhibit the best catalytic performance. Fig. 3 (a) The “acceptance and donation” mechanism between TM and N2. (b) The density of states of free N2 molecule and the adsorbed N2 molecule on MoL-NGDY and MoH-NGDY. (c) Charge density difference after N2 adsorption on MoL-NGDY and MoH-NGDY with isosurfce level = 0.007 electron/bohr3 (cyan and yellow, respectively, represent the consumption and accumulation of electrons). (d) The COHP comparison between N atoms in adsorbed N2 on MoL-NGDY, MoH-NGDY vs. pure N2. (e) Gibbs free energy for H* and N2* adsorption, and PDS of NRR on TML/H-GDY (TM = Mo, Nb, Re, Os, and W). Fig. 4 (a) Machine learning workflow. (b) Fitting results between DFT-calculated and ML-predicted ΔG PDS, and feature rankings by AdaBoost. (c) The feature rankings of TML/H-GDY by AdaBoost. (d) The calculation and prediction of TML/H-GDY, TML-GDY, and TMH-GDY by SISSO. Fig. 5 (a) The variation in Bader charge at a reaction Mo site and another Mo site during the six-electron step process of NRR. (b) Charge density difference and the heat map of ΔQ after Mo loaded on SAC MoL/H-GDY. (c) The charge variations induced in the 6 moieties of the SAC MoL/H-NGDY surface when an atom is added to form DAC, with the ΔQ values for each moiety labeled. Bold numbers represent the total charge transferred from the introduced metal to SAC. (d) Changes in 6 moieties of ΔQ during adsorption of different reaction intermediates on MoLMo-NGDY and MoHMo-NGDY. Fig. 6 (a) Gibbs free energy diagram for NRR at MoL and WH site on DAC MoW-NGDY.

Graphical abstract The long-range interaction mechanism driven by low coordination metals in nitrogen-doped graphdiyne derivatives (NGDY) enhances the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) selectivity and activity of dual active sites in dual-atom catalyst (DAC). Catalysts with asymmetric coordination exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity due to changes in the active sites, which affect the arrangement of reactants and catalytic activity/selectivity. Hence, the exploration of the inherent characteristics of active sites within diverse coordination environments holds great significance for the experimental design of catalytic structures. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) characterized by high coordination with four carbons (26 candidates) and low coordination with dinitrogen (27 candidates) are constructed using nitrogen-doped graphdiyne derivatives (NGDY) as the substrate. Additionally, 5 species of dual-atom catalysts (DACs) with coexistence of both high and low coordination sites are also developed and their nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) activities are systematically investigated by density functional theory. The results indicate that metals with low coordination exhibit superior catalytic performance, such as MoL-NGDY (U L = −0.30 V) and NbL-NGDY (U L = −0.32 V). Furthermore, machine learning (ML) methods have deeply analyzed and elucidated the primary intrinsic characteristics that influence catalytic performance. These results not only unveil the underlying mechanisms behind the exceptional catalytic performance exhibited by low-coordination metal atoms, but also provide relevant and significant descriptors. More importantly, based on an investigation of the catalytic activity of a series of DACs, the “buffer and low-coordination accumulate” asymmetric coordination mechanism is proposed to unveil the long-range interactions between low and high coordination atoms. Due to this remote communication, MoNb-NGDY (U L = −0.09/−0.37 V) exhibits the best NRR activity. This mechanism provides valuable insights into the origin of long-range bipartite interactions and inspires the design and synthesis of NRR catalysts with different coordination environments. Keywords Nitrogen reduction Asymmetric coordination DAC Machine learning Long-range interactions 1 Introduction In addressing the pressing challenges posed by energy and environmental issues, the development and utilization of clean and renewable energy sources have emerged as a pivotal strategy. Ammonia (NH3), characterized by its high energy density and safe transportation properties, has promising potential for applications in agricultural fertilizer production and industrial chemical synthesis [1,2]. Currently, the industrial production of NH3 primarily relies on the Haber-Bosch process, which operates under high-temperature and high-pressure conditions and results in substantial carbon dioxide emissions [3]. Electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) has emerged as a promising alternative to the Haber-Bosch process [4,5], offering significant environmental benefits by converting renewable electricity into chemical energy storage. This technology plays a critical role in advancing sustainable ammonia production and optimizing the nitrogen cycle. The primary challenges in electrocatalytic NRR stem from the competition with the thermodynamically favorable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), coupled with the low solubility of N2 in aqueous electrolytes and the high stability of the N≡N triple bond. These factors collectively result in low faradaic efficiency (FE) and ammonia production rates. Therefore, it is imperative to develop synergistic catalyst-electrolyte systems with high NRR activity and selectivity while also exploring reaction engineering strategies [6]. On the one hand, researchers have focused on developing highly active and selective NRR catalysts and investigating their reaction mechanisms. On the other hand, substantial efforts have been directed toward electrolyte engineering (e.g., lithium-mediated aprotic systems) and cell configuration design (e.g., the use of gas diffusion electrodes in flow cells), which collectively enhance N2 mass transfer efficiency and improve reaction stability [7–9]. In the exploration of high-efficiency NRR catalysts, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have garnered considerable attention in the field of catalysis due to their remarkable atomic economy, exceptional catalytic efficiency, and relatively low preparation costs [10,11]. In the design of SAC synthesis strategies, the selection of substrate material is crucial for maximizing single-atom activity [12]. Carbon-based two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as graphene and nitrogen-doped graphene, have served as platforms for transition metal (TM) single-atom supports [13–15], owing to their large specific surface area, diverse surface loading sites, straightforward synthesis routes, and excellent mechanical properties [16]. Moreover, the evolution from single-atom catalysts to dual-atom catalysts (DACs) [12,17–19] not only broadens the application scope of catalytic reactions, but also offers new insights and directions for achieving more efficient and selective catalytic processes. The diverse coordination environments offered by different carbon-based 2D materials enable SACs to exhibit exceptional catalytic activity and selectivity in key catalytic processes [20,21]. Li et al. [22] synthesized three Cu-SACs with unsaturated coordination via modified thermal polymerization and studied their photocatalytic performance. Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) results showed that Cu-N2-V, which features defective low-coordination Cu-N2 sites, exhibits a yield of approximately ∼10 times higher than that of Cu-N3 or Cu-N4. Wang et al. [23] developed Mn-N2/CNs with low coordination to optimize Mn monoatomic centers for better sulfur electrochemistry in room-temperature Na-S batteries. They discovered that the symmetric Mn-N4 structure weakly binds polar NaPSs, causing severe shuttle effects and slow kinetics, while Mn-N2 resolve these issues. Cho and his team [24] analyzed the key roles of low-coordinated PtII/CNT and three-coordinated PtII/CNT (with disrupted D4h symmetry) in electrocatalytic chlorine evolution reaction on carbon-based Pt SACs. Their findings highlighted the importance of disrupting geometric symmetry in SAC design. Despite the variety of catalytic reactions, studies of their coordination environments consistently indicate a common trend: asymmetric low-coordination environments are more favorable for catalysis. This preference is critical, as diverse coordination environments significantly regulate the activity, selectivity, and efficiency of electrocatalytic processes [25–27]. Therefore, for NRRs involving multiple electron transfer steps, it is crucial to explore the influence of coordination environment on the electronic structure and geometric configuration of SAC active sites [20,28–31], as well as the impact on the adsorption configuration of N2 molecules and the catalytic activity of NRRs. Graphdiyne (GDY), due to its inherent structural asymmetry, emerges as a unique 2D carbon allotrope, serving as an ideal substrate for exploring asymmetric coordination configurations [32,33]. However, due to the structural characteristics of GDY, current research on the catalytic activity of GDY-based SACs and DACs primarily focuses on symmetric four-coordinated configurations [34–37]. Duan et al. [38] employed a tom-up synthetic strategy to design nitrogen-containing graphdiyne analogue (N2-GDY) with an under-coordinated environment, utilizing GDY as the foundation. The subsequently synthesized Cu1.0-N2-GDY exhibited high Faraday efficiency in the electrocatalytic reduction (80.6%, −0.96 V vs. RHE). As depicted in Fig. 1 (a), the novel N2-GDY structure simultaneously provides a high-coordination environment with four-carbon atoms and a low-coordination environment with dinitrogen for single-atom metals. Additionally, the long distance between these two distinct sites offers the potential for exploring the active sources of bimetallic catalysts for remote regulation. Current DACs for electrocatalytic NRR are predominantly designed in symmetric configurations [35], while research on catalysts with asymmetric and low-coordination environments remains relatively scarce. Meanwhile, discussions on the electron transfer mechanisms underlying DAC activity primarily focuses on catalysts between metal atoms at closer distances [39,40]. Current research on the catalytic mechanisms of asymmetric configurations and the regulatory effects between distant active centers remains insufficient. Herein, N2-GDY (hereinafter simplified as NGDY) is employed as the substrate to anchor 28 transition metal (TM) atoms spanning from the 3d to 5d series at two specific sites on its surface, thereby constructing two SACs models TML/H-NGDY and one DAC model MoLTM-NGDY (among them, L represents the 2-N low coordination site, and H represents the 4-C high coordination site). Utilizing DFT calculations, both the SACs and the DACs are evaluated for their stability, NRR activity, and selectivity. After an initial screening process, 7 NRR SACs are discovered to exhibit great potential in catalytic activity and selectivity. Subsequently, the relationship between the local environment and the source of activity in SACs is discussed by combining electronic property analysis with machine learning (ML). In our study of DACs, there is a long-range interaction between low and high coordination TM atoms which named “buffer and low-coordination accumulate” asymmetric coordination mechanism. The flowchart illustrating the overall work process is presented in Fig. 1(a). This work offers insights into the understanding of the influence of the coordination environment on NRR catalytic activity and provides theoretical guidance for the rational design of effective NRR catalysts. 2 Computational methods The first-principle spin polarization calculations are performed by using the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) [41–43]. The electron exchange correlation functional is represented using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) function, which has been extended by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [44]. The ion–electron interaction is described by utilizing the projector augmented wave (PAW) potential. To account for the Van der Waals interaction, the long-range dispersion correction proposed by Grimme-D3 is employed [45]. The lattice constant of the NGDY unit cell is 14.10 Å, and the lattice constant along z direction of all 2D materials was fixed to be 20 Å to avoid the interactions between two periodic units. The kinetic cutoff energy was set to 400 eV. The criterion of convergence in structure optimization for energy is 10−5 eV, and 0.01 eV/Å for force. To sample the Brillouin region, 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack k-point meshed is performed. The binding energy E b of TML/H-NGDY is defined as follows [46]. (1) E b = E TM L / H - NGDY - E NG D Y - E T M L / H The changes of Gibbs free energy (ΔG) in each of the basic steps of the NRR process are defined as follows (2) Δ G = Δ E + Δ Z P E - T Δ S + Δ G U + Δ G p H The computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model proposed by Nørskov et al. was utilized to determine ΔG. Here, ΔZPE and ΔS represent the zero-point energy and entropy, respectively. The thermodynamic temperature (T) was set at 298.15 K. The free energy contribution from the applied voltage (U) is denoted as ΔG U and can be formulated as ΔG U = −neU. The ΔG pH accounts for variations in H+ concentrations and is calculated using ΔG pH = k B T × pH × ln10, where k B is the Boltzmann constant. In this study, the pH value was set to zero. The limiting potential (U L) required to overcome the energy barrier of the potential determining step (PDS) is defined as U L = −Max(ΔG i)/e. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Screening of efficient SACs TML/H-NGDY The primitive cell of NGDY, comprising a layered structure with 6 N and 18 C atoms, has been experimentally proven to consist of two types of sites suitable for single-metal loading: the L-site, coordinated by two N atoms, and the H-site, coordinated by four C atoms. A unit cell with lattice constants of a = 14.10 Å and b = 14.10 Å has been constructed, in which the distance between the two sites is measured to be 5.72 Å, as depicted in Fig. 1(b). SACs, designated as TML/H-NGDY, have been constructed by loading 28 types of transition metals from the 3d to 5d series onto these two sites on NGDY. Notably, the relevant data pertaining to the active sites of the radioactive element Tc are utilized solely in the ML section and will not be addressed in the results. A systematic four-step screening methodology, outlined in Fig. 1(b), is utilized to effectively identify NRR catalysts. Firstly, as illustrated in Fig. S1, the stability of TML/H-NGDY is considered, with the negative binding energies (E b) values indicating that the single metals are stably loaded onto the substrate. Due to the near-zero E b of ZnH, CdH, and CdL causing desorption of single atoms in the relaxed structure, 53 stable SAC models are selected. The fundamental prerequisites for the subsequent hydrogenation process include the adsorption and activation of N2 molecules on the catalyst surface. In Fig. 2 (a), two types of N2 adsorption configurations (end-on and side-on) are considered on the active sites. The energies for the most stable N2 adsorption on different SACs are displayed in Fig. 1(c), with additional data listed in Table S1. Ultimately, 50 varieties of TML/H-NGDY can efficiently adsorb N2, excluding ZnH, ZnL, CdH, CdL, PtH, and PtL. Fig. 2(a) illustrates the four reaction pathways of the NRR mechanism: distal, alternating, associative, and enzymatic. Studies have indicated that the first hydrogenation step (N2*→NNH*) and the last hydrogenation step (NH2*→NH3*) are typical PDSs that require sufficient energy input [47,48]. For rapid screening of NRR catalysts, the PDS energy of 0.64 eV on the ruthenium (Ru) (001) facet is adopted as the benchmark (Fig. S2). As shown in Fig. 2(b) and Table S2, the first and the last hydrogenation steps of TML/H-NGDY are screened. Under the screening criterion of ΔG PDS ≤ 0.64 eV, 12 SACs are identified: WL-NGDY, NbL-NGDY, OsL-NGDY, MoL-NGDY, ReL-NGDY, TiL-NGDY, NbH-NGDY, VH-NGDY, OsH-NGDY, RhH-NGDY, HfH-NGDY, and IrH-NGDY. The full reaction pathway calculations for these NRR catalysts are summarized in Tables S3 and S4, with ΔG PDS values ranging from 0.30 to 0.84 eV. Notably, HfH-NGDY is excluded due to its higher ΔG PDS (0.84 eV) compared to the Ru (001). During electrochemical processes, HER competes with NRR for active sites and electrons, reducing Faraday efficiency and hindering the practical application. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure the priority of N2 adsorption and superior activity over HER. Fig. S3 displays the competitive adsorption between H* and N2*, with ΔG N2* and ΔG H* listed in Table S5. Except for RhH-NGDY, other SACs prefer N2 adsorption. Fig. 2(c) compares NRR and HER limit potentials (U L), revealing seven SACs (MoL-NGDY, NbL-NGDY, ReL-NGDY, OsL-NGDY, WL-NGDY, OsH-NGDY, and NbH-NGDY) with good activity and selectivity of NRR (U L HER < U L NRR). Among them, low-coordination metals show superior performance. Although the U L NRR of OsL-NGDY (−0.58 V) is slightly inferior to OsH-NGDY (−0.57 V), Fig. 2(c) reveals that the adsorption selectivity of OsL for N2 is significantly better than that of OsH. For HER, the applied voltage impacts adsorption performance for H*, but not for N2* [49], making the larger difference in adsorption between N2* and H* particularly crucial for the NRR [50]. In the next section, we will delve into the intrinsic reasons behind the catalytic performance exhibited by low-coordination metals. The Gibbs free energy diagram for NRR on seven SACs is illustrated in Fig. 2(d) and Fig. S4. Except for WL-NDGY, N2 configuration on the other six SACs catalysts is end-on, with the distal pathway being the optimal one for NRR. On WL-NDGY, NRR occurs for N2 in the side-on mode via a consecutive pathway. Among them, MoL-NDGY exhibits the most excellent NRR activity with the PDS being 0.30 eV. In Fig. 2(c) and Fig. S3, the TML/H-NDGY nanosheets are also compared with those based on other 2D materials such as graphene and graphdiyne. It is evident that, compared to TMB@GY [51], TM@GDY [52], TM-BN-G [53], and TM-B-GY [54], TML/H-NDGY catalysts generally exhibit superior NRR activity and selectivity. This indicates that TML/H-NDGY nanosheets possess excellent catalytic properties for NRR, making them a highly desirable material for NRR. 3.2 Coordination environment and SACs catalytic performance An in-depth analysis and discussion of the electronic properties have been conducted to explain the superior activity of the low-coordination metal sites at the L-site compared to those at the H-site. After SACs adsorbed N2, the projected density of states (PDOS), crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP), the charge density difference, and Bader analysis of TML/H-GDY (TM = Mo, Os, Nb, W, and Re, which are the TM elements contained in the seven screened SACs) are calculated and analyzed in this section. As shown in Fig. 3 (a), the TM activates N2 through the “acceptance-donation” mechanism, where metal atoms accept their lone electron pairs when adsorbing nitrogen and feedback the electrons back to the 2π* orbital of N2, causing the antibonding state to transfer below the Fermi level [55]. This process weakens the N≡N bond strength and activates the N2 molecule. Taking MoL/H-NGDY as an example, the PDOS and pCOHP of free N2 are investigated, as well as MoL-NGDY and MoH-NGDY with N2 adsorption. In the case of MoH-NGDY, it is observable that the orbital hybridization between N2 and MoH site is more pronounced compared to that of MoL-NGDY (Fig. 3b). Fig. 3(c) shows the Bader analysis of Mo active sites and N2. Compared to N2 adsorbed on MoL site in an end-on, MoH sites simultaneously adsorb two N atoms in a side-on mode, thereby obtaining more electrons (+0.50 e− vs. +0.40 e−). These phenomena elucidate why N2 adsorption capacity is stronger on MoH-NGDY (ΔG N2* = −1.26 eV) than that on MoL-NGDY (ΔG N2* = −1.02 eV). However, COHP analysis in Fig. 3(d) shows that the strong adsorption on the MoH site fails to effectively activate the N≡N bond. The COHP analysis of pure N2 yielded an ICOHP(N–N) value of −9.30, indicating a very strong N≡N bond that is resistant to weakening and activation. After N2 adsorption on MoL-NGDY and MoH-NGDY, the values of ICOHP(N–N) increased to −4.09 and −6.79, respectively. The large difference in ICOHP indicates that MoL site is more favorable for N2 activation, thereby promoting subsequent hydrogenation steps. Subsequently, the ICOHP of H* adsorbed at two different sites is analyzed, revealing that the ICOHP(Mo–H) value at the MoL site (−0.25) is lower than that at the MoH site (−0.73), indicating weaker adsorption for H* on the L-site. This regulation of N2* and H* adsorption also appears in NbL-NGDY, ReL-NGDY, OsL-NGDY, and WL-NGDY, as shown in Fig. S5. In general, low coordination metal active centers have more unoccupied orbitals, which can more easily accept electrons from N2, thereby promoting activation of N2 and subsequent hydrogenation reactions. From Fig. 3(e), it is evident that the difference between ΔG N2* and ΔG H* in TML site is larger; accordingly, the 2-low coordination metal exhibits more advantageous adsorption of N2 than the 4-high coordination. This larger difference reduces the impact of applied voltage on nitrogen adsorption and prevents the active sites from being poisoned by H* [50]. To further investigate the relationship between the NRR asymmetric catalytic activity and the metal active sites as well as their coordination environment, machine learning algorithms can be employed to reveal the underlying relationship between the free energy values and the inherent features of the catalysts. Fig. 4 (a) illustrates the workflow of machine learning. We use the data with the largest Gibbs free energy for hydrogenation from both the initial and final steps in the DFT calculation as input values for ΔG PDS. The selected inherent features can be divided into two main categories: elemental features of the anchored TM atom and the substrate, and the structural and electronic characteristics of the local environment of the active sites. X is used to represent the coordinating elements around the TM atoms. They are atomic radius (R), metal atomic d-band center (ɛd), covalent radius (R C), atomic Pauling electronegativity (e Neg TM), ionization energies (IE), electron affinity (Ea), individual atomic energy of metals in stable alloys (Em), the number of electrons in the d-layer (ed), and number of coordination atom (N coord. X), respectively. Using the Scikit-learn Python library, a dataset comprising 50 data points is constructed and four machine learning algorithms—adaBoost, random forest (RF), support vector regression (VSR), and gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT)—are employed to evaluate the importance of each feature. As shown in Fig. 4(b) and Table S6, after performing the 10-fold cross-validation, compared with RF, GBDT, and SVR, the higher predictive accuracy of ΔG PDS is obtained by the AdaBoost algorithm with a high score of 0.97 and a low root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.06 eV for the training set. The e Neg TM and Em occupy a major position in the feature importance, with a ratio of 59.84% and 13.75%. The electronegativity of metals directly influences the relative magnitude of bonding electron attraction ability, which subsequently affects the adsorption and desorption processes of intermediates. From the overall feature ranking, the characteristics of the metal active center are the most major factors. The pie chart demonstrates that both the radius and the number of X-type coordination atoms remain critical factors in governing the ΔG PDS. Among them, the proportion of N coord. X is notably higher, specifically accounting for 8.20%. The feature importance of AdaBoost provided the intrinsic features ratios of metal active centers, while also demonstrating the potential influence of coordination atoms on the reaction steps of NRR. The coordination environment directly influences the electronic characteristics of the catalytic active centers. To explore the direct impact of low- and high-coordination metals on PDS, the AdaBoost algorithm is utilized, excluding the factor of coordination environment. A comparative analysis is conducted on two sets of PDS data from TML-NGDY and TMH-NGDY, respectively. The results of the importance ranking are presented in Fig. 4(c). In TML-NGDY, the top two factors are EaTM and EmTM, with proportions of 57.20% and 22.50%, respectively. In contrast, the highest proportions in TMH-NGDY belong to EmTM (62.77%) and ɛd (13.46%). This indicates that the low coordination environment greatly stimulates the influence of the electron affinity of the metal active center on the catalytic performance. As shown in Fig. 4(d), utilizing the SISSO algorithm, the relationship between target properties and inherent features can be presented in a clearer equational form by evaluating highly correlated subsets of features. There are 14 most significant intrinsic properties extracted, which encompass both the metal active center and its coordination environment. When considering both datasets of TML-NGDY and TMH-NGDY, the specific expression for the predicted ΔG PDS is as follows (3) Δ G P D S = - 1.721 I E 1 T M E m T M R T M × e N e g T M + 0.248 The training score of ΔG PDS is 0.88 (with a RMSE of 0.24 eV), indicating the existence of a certain error between the predicted and calculated values. However, upon removing the coordination environment factors and training the TML-NGDY and TMH-NGDY datasets separately, the following formula is obtained (4) Δ G P D S T M L - N G D Y = 0.813 ( E m T M - ε d ) × e N e g T M I E 2 T M - 0.001 M T M × ε d E a T M - ε d + 0.152 (5) Δ G P D S ( T M H - N G D Y ) = 4.480 I E 1 T M + ε d E m T M 2 + 0.006 e d T M ε d E m T M + I E 1 T M + 0.464 The separate training of data from different coordination environments results in a significant decrease in their respective RMSE (0.20 and 0.12), with more accurate predictions achieved through individualized training. This indicates that PDS affected by varying coordination environments is difficult to fit into a single formula. It further demonstrates the significant variability and uniqueness of PDS in different coordination environments. It is revealed that, despite the comparatively modest coefficients of the second terms in Eqs. (4) and (5) obtained through SISSO training, the RMSE of the one-dimensional expression increased significantly upon removing these terms (specifically, reaching to 0.25 and 0.17, as detailed in Table S7). This underscores the importance of the intrinsic features embedded within the second terms of the two-dimensional formulas, which cannot be disregarded. Furthermore, the intrinsic features revealed by formulas obtained through separate SISSO training of ΔG PDS align with the feature rankings result presented in Fig. 4(b), which underscores the good complementarity and mutual verification capability between SISSO and AdaBoost. 3.3 “Buffer and low-coordination accumulation” mechanism on DACs During the initial screening for active SACs, seven TML/H-NGDY (TM = Mo, Os, Nb, W, and Re) are identified, with MoL-NGDY exhibiting the highest NRR activity. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that metal active centers featuring low coordination display superior NRR activity and selectivity. There is a keen interest in exploring the potential impact of the coexistence of low- and high-coordinate metals on the NGDY surface on catalytic activity. Consequently, a series of DAC models are constructed, where a Mo atom is loaded at the 2-coordinate L-site, while various metals (Mo, Os, Nb, W, and Re) are placed at the 4-coordinate H-site. For simplicity, L or H is labeled only on the reaction site to indicate the coordination environment, and the reaction site is placed at the front. Meanwhile, the symbol TMATMB-NGDY is used to represent the overall DAC, where TMA is at the L-site and TMB is at the H-site. Their stability studies are presented in Table S8, and the results demonstrate that the E b of bimetallic sites is less than 0, and the co-existence of dual atoms is more stable compared to the presence of single atoms alone. The NRR activity of the homonuclear DAC MoMo-NGDY is first studied, with the Gibbs free energy diagram presented in Fig. S6. N2 is adsorbed in end-on mode at both active sites of MoMo-NGDY, and the optimal reaction pathway is the distal path, with their PDS both occurring at the first hydrogenation step. All subsequent electron-involved steps on MoMo-NGDY are exothermic. The introduction of Mo at the L-site changes the N2 adsorption configuration on MoHMo-NGDY from side-on to end-on. The change in adsorption mode results in a significant change in the energy of subsequent hydrogenation steps. The U L for MoLMo-NGDY is −0.23 V, and for MoHMo-NGDY it is −0.56 V, representing significant improvements in performance compared to their respective SAC counterparts. It is speculated that the enhanced performance of the dual active sites in MoMo-NGDY is attributed to the long-range interaction between the two Mo atoms. To substantiate this hypothesis, the Bader charges at both the reaction site and the other Mo site are calculated for the 6-proton-electron coupling step of NRR on MoLMo-NGDY and MoHMo-NGDY. As shown in Fig. 5 (a), it can be seen that there is a significant charge fluctuation at MoL site during the NRR of MoH site. Simultaneously, minor fluctuations are also observed at the Mo on H-site when MoL reacts. This indicates that there is indeed an interaction between the two sites during the reaction process, and MoH is more strongly affected by the low coordination of MoL during the NRR. To explain the occurrence of long-range interactions between MoL and TMH site, a quantity ΔQ is introduced. This value represents the difference in Bader charges between atoms on DACs (MoTM-NGDY) and those on SACs (TML-NGDY or MoH-NGDY). The application of ΔQ quantifies the charge redistribution upon introducing a second metal into SACs. Clarifying such variations is essential for studying the transfer of long-range electrons. Charge density difference after Mo loaded on L-site of MoH-NGDY and H-site of MoL-NGDY is shown in Fig. 5(b) (cyan and yellow, respectively, represent the consumption and accumulation of electrons). According to the Bader charge analysis results, MoL and MoH transferred 1.08 and 0.59 electrons respectively to MoH-NGDY and MoL-NGDY, and the ΔQ values of each atom are listed in Table S9. A heatmap of ΔQ values, as shown in Fig. 5(b), illustrates the detailed electron transfer from MoL/H to each atom of the substrate. Comparing the color of reaction site, it is evident that the MoL reaction site appears close to white, indicating minimal charge transfer from MoH. In contrast, MoH reaction site clearly receives electrons transferred from MoL. This phenomenon arises because among the four C atoms coordinated with MoH, C5 (where all atomic numbers of NGDY are labeled in Fig. S7) acquires a large number of electrons, which is also reflected by its darkest orange in the heatmap. Consequently, the electrons lost by MoH are progressively weakened as they are transferred outwardly. The NGDY substrate is a highly symmetrical structure, with the innermost layer C as the center and atoms distributed in a circular shape outward. Additionally, during the electron transfer process from Mo-to-Mo reaction site, all atoms in each layer are affected by the electron transfer and exhibit different electron gain and loss situations. As shown in Fig. 5(c), MoMo-NGDY can be divided into different layers from the inside out to analyze the overall electron transfer process. MoMo-NGDY is classified into 6 moieties (C1, N, C2, C3, C4 from the inside out, and MoL/H reaction site respectively), with numbers on each circle representing the sum of ΔQ for each moiety. The bold numbers represent Bader charge value of MoL/H. During the e− transition from MoL to MoH reaction site, MoL under low coordination lose more electrons (−1.08 e−), with the N layer serving as a “buffer layer” acquiring only +0.07 e−. Subsequently, electrons are transferred through the N layer to both inner and outer layers. The inner layer C1 receives some electrons (+0.26 e−), and then these electrons are passed outward, with each subsequent layer acquiring a gradually decreasing number of electrons, ultimately resulting in MoH gaining +0.10 e−. In contrast, during the transition from MoH to MoL reaction site, after losing electrons, the adjacent C4 and C3 layers acquire the vast majority of the electrons (+0.18 e− and +0.77 e−). Although there is a slight replenishment of electrons in the C3 layer, upon further transfer inward, the N and C1 layers gain only a minor number of electrons, and the electrons transferred to the MoL site are slight. It is inferred that the improved dual active site performance of MoMo-NGDY is attributed to the long-range interactions between these two metals. The driving effect of low coordinated MoL on four coordinated MoH is more pronounced, as it first contacts the N “buffer layer” and does not lose too many electrons in other C layers. This trend of charge transfer also occurs during the reaction process at the reaction site. The ΔQ profiles of six moieties and five dominant intermediates (N2*, NNH*, NH2*, NH3*, and H*) are tracked during HER and the first/last NRR hydrogenation stages, providing site-specific charge redistribution insights. The ΔQ values of 6 moieties and intermediates are visualized in Fig. 5(d), where the spots on dark blue line represent the value on the circle in Fig. 5(c). It is worth noting that, when adsorbing different intermediates, ΔQ also showed the same trend. N acts as a buffer layer to better transfer electrons to the outer layer. The relevant data of ΔQ are shown in Table S10. The comparison of the obvious trend in Fig. 5(d) confirms the remote interactions driven by the low coordination metal. Due to the differences in electronegativity, ionization energy, and other factors between homonuclear bimetallic materials, the amount of charge transfer is not obvious. Additionally, potential diatomic catalyst models containing two Mo atoms are compared in terms of their activity. One is a DAC MoHMoH-NGDY, where the two Mo atoms are bonded to each other and both located at H-sites. The other is a DAC MoLMoL-NGDY, where the two Mo atoms are separately positioned at two L-sites. The comparison of performance among them is illustrated in Fig. S8, with specific data listed in Table S11. The dual active sites of MoMo-NGDY exhibit superior catalytic activity and selectivity compared to single-atom catalysts and other diatomic catalysts. The free energy diagrams and the intermediate structures of the optimal NRR pathways for all DACs MoTM-NGDY (TM = Mo, Os, Nb, W, and Re) are illustrated in Fig. S9. The results show that, compared to SAC, the catalytic performance of both active sites in DAC MoTM-NGDY are greatly improved, with MoLW-NGDY, MoLNb-NGDY, MoLRe-NGDY, and MoLOs-NGDY exhibiting extremely low NRR limiting potential of −0.07, −0.09, −0.10, and −0.12 V, respectively. Meanwhile, the catalytic performance of MoL site on heteronuclear DACs is significantly better than that of homonuclear DACs. The combined influence of long-range interactions and a low-coordination environment renders the MoL sites exhibit superior catalytic activity. This also indicates that heteronuclear DACs have superior activity. It is noteworthy that the varying trend of ΔQ is also observed in MoOs-NGDY, MoNb-NGDY, MoW-NGDY, and MoRe-NGDY, as shown in Fig. S10 and Tables S12–S16. Fig. 6 (a) displays the Gibbs free energy diagram for NRR on DAC MoW-NGDY. In the presence of both metals, the adsorption capacity of N2 is significantly enhanced, and the adsorption mode of N2 on WH site changes to side-on compared to SAC WH-NGDY. The optimal reaction pathways for MoL and WH sites are distal pathway and consecutive pathway, respectively. The U L at the WH site is reduced from −0.91 to −0.80 V. MoL site exhibits the lowest U L of −0.07 V. The Bader charge analysis results of MoW-NGDY are shown in Fig. 6(b). Before N2 adsorption, Mo and W transfer 1.03 and 1.10 electrons to NGDY. Due to N having a lower electronegativity than C, the N layer gains electrons. With the N layer serving as the boundary, both the inner and outer carbon layers, C1 and C2, lose electrons. The electrons loss from the metal, C1, and C2 layers converge in the N layer. When N2 is activated at the MoL site, WH site loses more electrons and remotely supplies electrons to the active site, and these electrons gradually accumulate in the N layer and are then donated to N2. The right diagram indicates two pathways, along which the charge undergoes significant changes. Combining Fig. 6(b) and Fig. 5(d), due to the driving force of the low-coordination MoL, MoL transfers electrons to the TMH through the buffering of the N-layer, while the electrons lost by the TMH undergo buffering in the N-layer before accumulating back at the MoL during the N2 activation step. This unique electron transfer mechanism is termed as “buffer and low-coordination accumulate” asymmetric coordination mechanism. To determine whether the long-range interactions induced by low-coordination Mo are structurally dependent and whether such interactions can be generalized to other metals in L-sites, we analyze the catalytic activities of WW-NGDY and WMo-NGDY, as shown in Fig. S11. By comparing the PDS of WW-NGDY and WL/H-NGD, it can be observed that the NRR performance of both WL (0.45 vs. 0.48 eV) and WH (0.91 vs. 0.89 eV) sites has been slightly improved. The changes of ΔQ in 6 moieties have also shown the same trend. However, the PDS of WHW-NGDY (0.89 eV) and MoHW-NGDY (0.65 eV) is significantly higher than that of WHMo-NGDY (0.65 eV) and MoHMo-NGDY (0.54 eV), which indicates that WL site in WTM-NGDY does not improve the activity of each site. The PDOS and pCOHP of MoHMo-NGDY and MoHW-NGDY with N2 adsorption are investigated in Fig. S12. In the case of MoHMo-NGDY, it is observable that the orbital hybridization between N2 and MoH site is more pronounced. This phenomenon elucidates why N2 adsorption is stronger on MoHMo-NGDY than MoHW-NGDY. After N2 adsorption on MoHMo-NGDY and MoHW-NGDY, the values of ICOHP(N–N) are −5.36 and −5.60. Therefore, the MoH site in MoMo-NGDY exhibits superior catalytic activity in facilitating N2 activation. Further evidence supports the existence of an undercoordination-driven “buffer and low-coordination accumulate” asymmetric coordination mechanism in homonuclear diatomic species, whereas W located at the N-site exhibits significantly less driving force compared to Mo, resulting in limitations in enhancing the activity of heteronuclear DAC WTM-NGDY. As shown in Fig. 6(d), a comparison of MoLTM-NDGY DACs with other reported TM diatomic catalysts reveals their superior NRR activity and selectivity [31,56–58]. Finally, three MoTM-NGDY DACs with double active sites have been selected: MoNb-NGDY (−0.09 and −0.36 V), MoOs-NGDY (−0.10 and −0.42 V), and MoMo-NGDY (−0.23 and −0.56 V). The NRR U L for both active sites in these DACs is better than that of Ru (001). Meanwhile, the Mo site on MoLW-NGDY exhibits the lowest PDS for NRR (U L = −0.07 V). 4 Conclusions In summary, we have investigated the NRR activity of SACs and DACs based on nitrogen-containing graphdiyne analogue (NGDY), focusing on the influence of coordination environments on catalytic active site, as well as the mechanisms of long-range communication between dual active sites. Based on the screened NRR SACs, the combination of DFT calculations and machine learning is employed to elucidate the potential causes of the superior activity and selectivity exhibited by metals in low coordination states during catalytic processes. Furthermore, the AdaBoost algorithm is used to determine the ranking of feature importance, followed by quantification using the SISSO method. In the study of DACs, three DACs with dual active sites are successfully screened, with MoNb-NGDY (U L = −0.09/−0.37 V) exhibiting the best performance. The origin of this dual active center is primarily attributed to the long-range interactions by “buffer and low-coordination accumulate” asymmetric coordination mechanism between bimetallic atoms. This research unveils the intrinsic relationship between the local environment of catalytic active centers and their activity, providing new directions for designing NRR catalysts with diverse coordination environments.

        "dc:description": "Catalysts with asymmetric coordination exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity due to changes in the active sites, which affect the arrangement of reactants and catalytic activity/selectivity. Hence, the exploration of the inherent characteristics of active sites within diverse coordination environments holds great significance for the experimental design of catalytic structures. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) characterized by high coordination with four carbons (26 candidates) and low coordination with dinitrogen (27 candidates) are constructed using nitrogen-doped graphdiyne derivatives (NGDY) as the substrate. Additionally, 5 species of dual-atom catalysts (DACs) with coexistence of both high and low coordination sites are also developed and their nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) activities are systematically investigated by density functional theory. The results indicate that metals with low coordination exhibit superior catalytic performance, such as MoL-NGDY (U L = −0.30 V) and NbL-NGDY (U L = −0.32 V). Furthermore, machine learning (ML) methods have deeply analyzed and elucidated the primary intrinsic characteristics that influence catalytic performance. These results not only unveil the underlying mechanisms behind the exceptional catalytic performance exhibited by low-coordination metal atoms, but also provide relevant and significant descriptors. More importantly, based on an investigation of the catalytic activity of a series of DACs, the “buffer and low-coordination accumulate” asymmetric coordination mechanism is proposed to unveil the long-range interactions between low and high coordination atoms. Due to this remote communication, MoNb-NGDY (U L = −0.09/−0.37 V) exhibits the best NRR activity. This mechanism provides valuable insights into the origin of long-range bipartite interactions and inspires the design and synthesis of NRR catalysts with different coordination environments.",
