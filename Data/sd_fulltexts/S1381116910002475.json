Tel.: +81 29 861 8454; fax: +81 29 861 8374. Graphical abstract MFI zeolite catalysts with various Si/Al2 ratios were synthesized. Ethanol conversion reaction results imply that the acidic sites of this series of MFI-type zeolite catalysts were of the same nature. Industrial demand for propylene is increasing. Alternative sources of propylene other than petroleum are of wide interest. The catalytic transformation of bioethanol is a promising avenue for the production of propylene. However, the reaction mechanism and the nature of active sites on the catalyst remained unclear. In this work, MFI-type zeolite catalysts with various Si/Al2 ratios (73, 97, 128, 176, 207) were prepared by hydrothermal synthesis under atmospheric pressure. We characterized these MFI catalysts by BET surface area measurements, X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, temperature programmed desorption of ammonia, and 27Al MAS NMR to understand the effect of the Si/Al2 ratio. The ethanol conversion reaction was systematically investigated using these catalysts according to the contact time and reaction temperature. The conversion of ethanol yielded similar product distributions over these catalysts at different contact times, indicating that the product distribution has no relationship with the Si/Al2 ratio. Also, the propylene production rates per acidic site of these catalysts were similar. These results strongly imply that the acidic sites of the different MFI-type zeolite catalysts have the same nature, as well as the same reactivity. The catalytic activity was proportional to the number of acidic sites. Keywords Ethanol Propylene MFI Si/Al2 ratio Active sites 1 Introduction As a major chemical intermediate, the production of propylene always attracts broad attention in the industrial and academic research field. Propylene is generally produced by steam thermal cracking of the naphtha from the petroleum. However, due to the global energy crisis and the increasing demand for propylene in the industrial field, much more attention has been paid to alternative resources to petroleum. Methanol can be obtained in large quantities from fossil fuels like petroleum, nature gas and coal. The process for methanol to gasoline (MTG) and methanol to olefins (MTO), which can be used to produce liquid fuels for the automotive sector or to make olefins suitable for polymerization, has been well established and commercialized since 1980s [1,2]. Ethanol can be produced from renewable sources such as biomass by fermentation. It also has great potential to be a candidate for the source of light olefins such as ethylene and propylene. If the conversion of ethanol to propylene is selective and efficient, propylene can be produced without the utilization of petroleum resources. Therefore, ethanol to olefin (ETO) process has recently received much attention but has not yet been used in industrial application. Only a few literatures reported the conversion of ethanol or ethylene to olefin. These literatures reported the conversion of ethanol to hydrocarbons over unmodified and metal-modified ZSM-5 catalysts [3–9]. The conversion of ethylene to propylene has also been investigated over SAPO-34 [10] and nickel ion-loaded mesoporous silica catalysts [11]. Recently, LEV zeolite catalyst was also used for the ethanol to olefin reaction [12]. However, as mentioned above, much attention has been paid to mainly synthesize ethylene, gasoline, or aromatic hydrocarbons from ethanol. There are few reports concerning the ethanol to propylene process [8]. The zeolite H-ZSM-5 has been widely used as the active catalyst for various reactions owing to its special pore structure, thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity, and reactivity. It has long been used for MTO conversion in industry [1,2]. Furthermore, this catalyst was found to be the alternative catalyst for ethanol transformation into hydrocarbons. Understanding the reaction mechanism and active sites of H-ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts is crucial for improving catalytic performance in ethanol conversion; however, the reaction mechanism and the nature of the active sites remain unclear. Recently, we studied the conversion reaction of ethanol to propylene on H-ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts. In those works, we speculated that a series of MFI-type zeolite catalysts with various Si/Al2 ratios could be used to explore both the catalytic performance of these catalysts under various operating conditions and the nature of active sites for the conversion of ethanol to propylene. In this work, we successfully synthesized a series of MFI-type zeolite catalysts with various Si/Al2 ratios (73, 97, 128, 176, 207) and characterized the catalysts by BET surface area measurements, X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD), and 27Al MAS NMR to understand the effects of Si/Al2 ratios. We systematically converted ethanol to propylene over these catalysts at various contact times and reaction temperatures. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of catalyst A series of MFI-type zeolite catalysts with various Si/Al2 ratios was synthesized hydrothermally. Colloidal silica (SNOWTECH O) and Al(NO3)3·9H2O were used as Si and Al sources, respectively. Tetra-n-propylammonium bromide was used as a template. Al(NO3)3·9H2O was first dissolved in the Colloidal Silica, and then NaCl and NaOH were added to get solution A. The template was dissolved in water to get solution B. Solution B was added slowly to solution A with stirring. After the addition was completed, the gel was stirred for at least 30min to homogenize while being heated to 373K. Then the hydrothermal conversion was conducted under reflux for 14 days at atmospheric pressure. Finally, the Na-type zeolites were filtered off, washed thoroughly with deionized water until no Cl− remained in the filtrate, dried at 383K for 16h, and calcined at 873K for 4h in an air stream to burn off the template remaining in the zeolite crystals. H-type zeolite catalysts were prepared from Na-type catalysts by the ion-exchange method. The Na-type zeolite catalysts were repeated ion-exchange for 4 times with a 1M HCl aqueous solution (500mL) under reflux at 373K for 7 days. Finally, the product was filtered off, washed with deionized water until no Cl− remained in the filtrate and dried at 383K for 16h. After that, the catalysts were calcined in air at 873K for 4h with a heating rate of 4.5K/min. 2.2 Characterization Surface areas and pore volumes were determined by the N2 adsorption-desorption method (BET method) at 77K by using a volumetric unit (Micromeritics ASAP 2020). Prior to the adsorption measurements, each sample was degassed at 623K for 10h under reduced pressure. XRD patterns of the solid products were measured with a powder X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, RINT 2000) with Cu Kα monochromatized radiation (λ =0.154178nm) at 40kV and 40mA. Si/Al2 ratios of these catalyst samples were determined by XRF (RIGAKU EDXL 300). The crystal morphology was observed by SEM (Jeol-JSM-5600). NH3-TPD was also used (BEL-CAT-32) to investigate the acidic site properties. Catalyst sample (0.1g) was placed in a small quartz tube and dried in flowing He (99.99%, 30mL/min) at 773K for 1h. The sample was cooled to 373K, the adsorption of NH3/He (30mL/min) for 1h took place at 373K, and then the catalyst was flushed with He (30mL/min) at the same temperature for 1h to remove NH3 that was physically adsorbed on the sample surface. TPD measurements were done from 373 to 873K with a heating rate of 10K/min, with He as the carrier gas. The desorbed NH3 was quantified with a thermal conductivity detector. The 27Al MAS NMR spectra were obtained on a Varian VXR-400 spectrometer at 104.3MHz with a ca. 4.5kHz spinning speed and 1.73μs pulses for 4000 scans. The chemical shift was referenced to an external standard of Al (H2O)6 3+. 2.3 Catalytic apparatus and ethanol transformation reaction Ethanol (99.5%, Wako) was used without further purification. All the MFI zeolite samples were powdered, pressed, crushed, and sieved with a 14–22 mesh. The conversion reaction was carried out at atmospheric pressure using a continuous-flow fixed-bed quartz tubular reactor with 0.1–0.8g catalyst. Reaction temperature (673–873K) was monitored by a thermocouple in the catalyst bed. Prior to each reaction, the catalyst was pretreated in a flow of N2 (flow rate: 100mL/min) at 873K for 1h. Reactants (ethanol concentration 50vol% in a flow of N2) were fed into the reactor by means of a micro pump and were vaporized before entering the reactor. The reaction products were analyzed by using on-line gas chromatography (hydrogen-flame ionization detector with RT-alumina PLOT (Restek USA) for C1–C4 hydrocarbon, and thermal conductive detector with Shincarbon ST (Shinwa Chem. Ind. Ltd., Japan) for N2 and H2). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of MFI zeolite catalysts Table 1 summarizes the XRF and nitrogen adsorption/desorption (BET) results for these MFI zeolite catalysts. The BET surface areas of all the catalysts were between 370 and 420m2 g−1. The pore volumes of the catalysts were mostly about 0.2cm3 g−1. These MFI zeolites were characterized for their crystalline nature by XRD. The XRD patterns of the synthesized MFI zeolites are shown in Fig. 1 . All samples’ XRD patterns presented similar diffraction peaks, which were consistent with typical X-ray patterns of MFI-type zeolite structure, and no other peak could be observed. The results indicated that the MFI-type catalysts with high purity were successfully synthesized. As shown in Fig. 1, the XRD patterns have different relative peak intensity. The MFI catalysts with the higher Si/Al2 ratio showed higher peak intensity. Fig. 2 displays the 27Al MAS NMR spectra of the catalyst samples with various Si/Al2 ratios. The peak at 56ppm is commonly assigned to four-coordinated framework aluminum, while the peak at 0ppm is referred to non framework octahedral aluminum [13]. As shown in Fig. 2, all the catalyst samples exhibited the same framework aluminum (tetrahedrally coordinated) peaks at about 56ppm. No nonframework aluminum peak could be observed. The results indicate that all the Al atoms are incorporated into the catalyst framework. Furthermore the intensity of the signal at 56ppm decreased with increasing Si/Al2 ratio. SEM was also used to investigate the crystal size and morphology of these MFI catalyst samples. The micrographs were presented in Fig. 3 . Most of these crystals showed the MFI-typical hexagonal morphology. The crystals of the catalyst with Si/Al2 =73 were smaller than 1μm. The small crystals of the catalyst with Si/Al2 =97 tended to form agglomerates around 5–10μm. The catalyst with Si/Al2 =128 included some small crystals (smaller than 2.5μm) together with large crystals (about 10μm), all with the same shape. The crystals of the catalysts with Si/Al2 =176 and 207 were similar in shape, but the latter were a little larger. Clearly, the Si/Al2 ratio affected the morphology of these MFI catalysts. The crystals size increased with Si/Al2 ratio, a conclusion that is also supported by the XRD peak intensities. We investigated the amount and strength of acidic sites of the zeolite catalyst series by using the NH3-TPD method (Fig. 4 ). All the catalyst samples exhibited the same two well-resolved NH3 desorption peaks: the low-temperature peak at about 473K and the high-temperature peak at about 673K, corresponding to the weak and strong acid sites, respectively. This result means that the strengths of the acid sites of these MFI catalysts were the same. The spectral peak area decreased with increasing Si/Al2 ratio, which indicates that the density and total amount of acidic sites decreased with increasing Si/Al2 ratio. 3.2 Transformation of ethanol to propylene Over each of the synthesized MFI-type catalysts, we carried out the ethanol conversion reactions under atmospheric pressure at 673, 723, 773, 823, and 873K. Under these reaction conditions on these catalysts, ethanol was completely converted to hydrocarbons, such as ethylene, propylene, and other higher hydrocarbons. We compared catalytic performance at various contact times and reaction temperatures. The optimum yield for propylene (at various reaction temperatures) was 24–28%. Fig. 5 shows the production distribution on these catalysts at 823K. The contact time is defined as W/F, where W denotes the catalyst weight (g) and F denotes the total flow rate (mL/min). As shown in Fig. 5, over all catalysts, ethylene was the main product under very low W/F conditions. As W/F increased, ethylene yield decreased, and propylene and butene yields increased. Paraffins (ethane, propane, and butane) increased with the decrease of olefins (ethylene, propylene, and butene), which were produced by hydrogenerating olefin. On the basis of these results, we proposed the reaction mechanism. First, ethylene was produced from ethanol. Then the ethylene was converted in parallel to propylene and butene. Finally, propylene, and butene were converted to propane, butane, and other higher hydrocarbons (olefin, paraffins, and aromatics). The details of the reaction mechanism will be presented in a future report. As shown in Fig. 5, the contact time for optimum propylene yield increased with increasing Si/Al2 ratio, perhaps due to variations in MFI catalyst acidic site density with Si/Al2 ratio: the acidic site density of MFI catalyst with high Si/Al2 ratio was lower than that of catalyst with low Si/Al2 ratio. So the contact time when the optimum propylene yield was obtained was delayed. In addition, in order to develop the catalyst with high selectivity for ethanol transformation to propylene, it is very important to inhibit the transformation from propylene and butene to over C5 products, which will be further investigated in our future work. We also further compared and summarized the above product distribution results. At various contact times (W/F), similar product distributions were obtained on all five catalysts (Table 2 ). This result strongly implies that the product distribution is independent of the Si/Al2 ratio. The nature of acidic sites among H-ZSM-5 catalysts should be the same. The high-temperature peak acid sites were reported to be connected with the active center for the conversion of methanol [14]. We calculated the number of strong acid sites corresponding to the desorption amount of NH3 at high temperature from the NH3-TPD spectra of our zeolite catalyst series; also, we calculated the initial propylene space-time yield (STY) of these MFI-type catalysts. Fig. 6 showed the relationship between STY and the NH3 desorption amount at high temperature (673K). The relationship of STY to NH3 desorption amount at the high temperature (673K) was almost linear; that is, STY increased linearly with the number of strong acid sites. So the strong acid sites are the active sites for the ethanol conversion to propylene. The turnover frequency on each active site was same on the different Si/Al2-ratio catalysts. This indicates that the active sites are the same in nature on the different H-ZSM-5 catalysts. For the ethanol conversion reaction, only the number of active sites on the MFI catalysts changed with Si/Al2 ratio. On the basis of the product distribution and TPD results, we propose that the nature and reactivity of the acidic sites are the same on MFI-type zeolite catalysts with different Si/Al2 ratios. 4 Conclusions A series of MFI-type zeolite catalysts with various Si/Al2 ratios was successfully synthesized. To understand the effects of Si/Al2 ratios on the catalysts, we characterized them by BET surface area measurements, XRF, XRD, SEM, NH3-TPD and 27Al MAS NMR. The conversion of ethanol over these catalysts at various contact times yielded similar product distributions, which indicates that the product distribution is independent of the Si/Al2 ratio. Also, the production rates of propylene per acidic site of these catalysts were identical. These results strongly imply that the acidic sites on the different MFI-type zeolite catalysts have the same nature and reactivity; the catalytic activity should be proportional to the number of acidic sites.
