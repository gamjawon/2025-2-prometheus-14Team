In both reactor types, methanol and limonene as feedstock react to 1-methyl-4-[alpha- methoxy-isopropyl]-l-cyclohexene with a yield of about 85%. Thus, the beta zeolite seems to be more active and selective for methoxylation of limonene than other catalysts described in the literature for this reaction type. For the methoxylation of alpha-pinene, however, the highest yield of the corresponding alpha-terpinyl methyl ether is only up to 50% in both reactor types, as several bicyclic and double addition products are formed in parallel. The selectivity for all addition products together can reach values of about 85%. The other zeolites and solid acids applied for the methoxylation of alpha-pinene reveal considerably lower conversion and selectivity. We discuss the dependencies of conversion, selectivity and product distribution on tempera- ture, WHSV, TOS, pressure and the starting material ratio. The possibility for a regeneration of beta zeolite with air or oxygen is shown as well. Different linear and branched alcohols (C t-C5 alcohols) are compared in relation to their activity for the heterogeneously catalyzed alkoxylation of limonene and alpha-pinene.

Introduction Zeolites can be used for numerous acid catalyzed reactions, e.g., nucleophilic and electrophilic substitution reactions, isomerisation and rearrangement reac- tions, addition and elimination reactions or oxidation and condensation reactions [1-5]. We report on the synthesis of 1-methyl-4-[alpha-alkoxy-isopropyl]-l- cyclohexenes which are used as flavours and fragrances for perfume and cosmetic products, as additives for pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals, as well as in the food industry [6-9]. They are also very important for the synthesis of specialty fine chemicals and natural-like products [10,11] (Scheme 1). Particular 1-methyl-4-[alpha-alkoxy-isopropyl]-l-cyclohexenes are evaluated by a perfumer according to their flavours. The alpha-terpinyl methyl ether smells grapefruit-like and might be used as a perfumery material. The ethyl derivative has a green citrous fragrance, and the butyl derivative smells woody. The propyl derivative has a fresh grass flavour. Several ways to produce these alpha-terpinyl alkyl ethers are known [12-29], but limonene and alpha-pinene are the mostly used feedstock molecules. Alkox- ylation of limonene and alpha-pinene over homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts as, e.g., strong acids HC1, U2SO4 or p-toluenesulfonic acid [12-17], aluminium trichloride and boron trifluoride etherate [18] and acidic cation exchange resin [19] has already been reported. The reaction of alpha-terpinyl chloride (which can be obtained by the addition of dry hydrogen chloride to limonene) with protic solvents (CI-C5 alcohol) over zinc or silver compounds as catalysts leads to the corresponding ethers with good yields (up to 95%) [20-221. Due to corrosion and environmental problems, almost all the catalysts for the production of 1-methyl-4-[alpha-alkoxy-isopropyl]-1-cyclohexenes are unaccept- able for the industry. The main drawbacks of the application of zinc and silver compounds as well as Lewis acids are difficult to handle and the separation of CH3 CH3 H3 H3 H3 H2 OR limonene 1 -methyl-4-[alpha-alkoxy- isopropyl]-l-cyclohexene ROH 4t Scheme 1. CH3 alpha-pinene K. Hensen et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 311-329 313 the catalysts is complicated, which are often destroyed in this process. More- over, zinc or silver compounds require environmental reconditioning. Another process to produce alkylterpinylethers is the oxymercuration-de- mercuration of limonene with mercury acetate in anhydrous methanol followed by treatment with alkaline sodium boron hydride [23,24]. A mixture consisting of unreacted limonene (39%), methylterpinylether (33%) and a dimethylether (28%) is obtained. Due to the above mentioned problems and the high toxicity of the mercury salts, this process is not feasible for an industrial application. The zeolite-catalyzed alkoxylation of limonene [25,26] and alpha-pinene [26-28] over acid-treated mordenite, clinoptilolite and ferrierite as catalysts has already been reported in the literature. Two Chinese groups [27,28] carried out the zeolite-catalyzed addition of methanol to alpha-pinene in a batch reactor under atmospheric pressure at a temperature of 50-100. In 5 h reaction time, they obtained up to 35% 1-methyl-4-[alpha-methoxy-isopropyl]-l-cyclohexene in the presence of an acid-treated mordenite, which was not further character- ized. Methoxylation of limonene over the above mentioned catalyst [25] at a temperature of 50-70 and 5 h reaction time in a batch reactor yielded 1-methyl-4-[alpha-methoxy-isopropyl]-l-cyclohexene up to 55%. M. Nomura et al. [26] carried out zeolite-catalyzed alkoxylation of limonene and alpha-pinene with methanol, ethanol, n-propanol and n-butanol as addition compounds in a batch reactor under atmospheric pressure at a temperature of 65-115 and 2-5 days reaction time. The best results were obtained for methoxylation of limonene in the presence of a clinoptilolite-type zeolite (60% yield). The yield of the corresponding alpha-terpinyl ether decreases for the addition of ethanol to limonene over mordenite (54%) and n-propanol to limonene over ferrierite-type zeolite (48%). The alkoxylation of alpha-pinene with methanol in the presence of mordenite achieved also the highest yields of 66% for 1-methyl-4-[alpha-methoxy-isopropyl]-1-cyclohexene. With n-propanol as addition compound and clinoptilolite as catalyst the yield decreased remark- ably to 30%; however, with n-butanol as addition compound and ferrierite as catalyst the yield to the corresponding alpha-terpinyl ethers increased again to 40%. Neither the group of M. Nomura [26] nor the Chinese groups [25,27,28] have described whether the reaction occurs inside or outside the pore structure. However, on account of the small pores of clinoptilolite and ferrierite, it probably takes place on the outer surface of these zeolites. Syntheses of 1-methyl-4-[alpha-alkoxy-isopropyl]-l-cyclohexenes via zeolite-catalyzed alkoxylation of other terpenes were reported in a review paper [29]. The aims of this work were: (a) improvement and optimization of the already existing zeolite-catalyzed processes with regard to conversion and selectivity; (b) regeneration of the zeolite and (c) run of the reaction in a continuous process to make an industrial application feasible. 314 K. Hensen et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 311-329 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials o~-Pinene (boiling point 155-156, purity 98% (GC)) and limonene (boiling point 176-178, purity 98% (GC)) were kindly provided by Firmenich S.A. (Geneve, Switzerland). The alcohols were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification. The zeolites in powder form were kindly provided by the PQ Corp., USA. The ion exchanger and the heteropolyacid were obtained from commercial sources. The powder was kneaded with water and a peptizing agent. Afterwards it was formed into extrudates with a diameter of 2 mm. These extrudates were dried at 110 for 12 h, then heated up with the rate of 1 K/min and calcined at 500 for 12 h. Crushing and sieving gave a catalyst with the particle size of 1.0-1.6 mm for the fixed bed reactor. 2.2. Apparatus and general reaction procedure 2.2.1. Batch reactor 2 g zeolite powder, 20-200 g alcohol and 10-100 g limonene or alpha-pinene (measured to 0.1 g accuracy) were introduced in this order into a 50-500 ml batch reactor and heated in an oil bath under stirring, with a reflux condenser. The temperature of the oil bath was in the range of 25-100. Samples were taken from the reactor at regular intervals by using a syringe filter. After 1 to 20 h the catalyst was recovered through filtration or centrifugation. The exact reaction conditions are given in Tables 1-3, 6-8. 2.2.2. Fixed bed reactor Alkoxylation of limonene or alpha-pinene was carried out in an integral continuous flow fixed bed reactor made of a stainless steel tube (9 mm i.d., 12 Table 1 Methoxylation of limonene in the presence of various acidic catalysts in a batch reactor Catalyst Temperature Conversion (%) Selectivity (%) Yield (%) () (limonene) (o~-terpinyl methyl ether) (a-terpinyl methyl ether) H-Mordenite(15) a 100 5.6 80.0 4.5 H-USY (6) a 100 8.7 74.1 6.4 H-USY (40) a 60 57.1 78.8 45.0 H-USY (70) a 100 6.2 70.5 4.4 H-Beta (25) a 25 91.1 93.2 84.9 Ion exchanger 60 84.5 61.0 51.5 Heteropolyacid 100 98.4 4.7 4.6 a The various SiO2/A1203 ratios of the zeolites are put in parentheses.

The operation under pressure was possible, too. For the catalyst pretreatment and regeneration, the apparatus is equipped with gas dosing systems (mass flow controllers, Brooks) for N2, 02 and air. Zeolite catalysts in form of small particles (1.0-1.6 mm) in amounts of 2-5 g were placed in the center of the reactor by using a glass wool plug. An inert bed of 2-5 g glass beads (< 1.0 mm) lay on the catalyst bed.

Before terpenes and alcohols were introduced, zeolite catalysts were pretreated by heating under a nitrogen stream to 500 (heating rate of 1 K/min) overnight. Then, the reactor was cooled down to the desired reaction tempera- ture under a stream of nitrogen and 2-20 g/h limonene or alpha-pinene and 4-40 g/h of alcohol were added into the reactor using two separate HPLC pumps (Latek P-402). The products were condensed in a cold liquid trap at 4. The regeneration of zeolite was carried out with oxygen or air in the same way as the above mentioned pretreatment of the catalyst. The regeneration time was dependent on the amount of gas flowing over the catalyst bed. 2.3. Analysis of the products The product analysis was performed in a Siemens Sichromat 3 using a 35-m capillary column (FS-SE 54-CS) with nitrogen as carrier gas. The injection volume was 0.3 /xl, and injection temperature 250. The temperature program started at 80 and ended at 280 with a heating rate of 5 K/min to 130 and 15 K/min to 280. The internal standard was tridecane. The different com- pounds were identified by comparing the GC-MS, GC-IR and NMR results with those of original samples. The mass balance was at least 98%. 2.4. Characterization of the catalysts The quality of the zeolites used was checked by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Siemens D 5000 diffractometer and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of ammonia. The BET surface area of the catalysts were calculated from nitrogen adsorption at 77 K (Omnisorb 100). Further informa- tion about the characterization of the catalysts will be published elsewhere [30]. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Alkoxylation of limonene 3.1.1. Reactions in the batch reactor Methanol reacts with limonene over acidic catalysts in a batch reactor to 1-methyl-4-[alpha-methoxy-isopropyl]-l-cyclohexene (alpha-terpinyl methyl ether) as the main reaction product (see Scheme 2: R-= CH3-). Besides the desired methoxylation, isomerisation reactions leading to terpinolene and traces of alpha- and gamma-terpinene can be observed. Furthermore, the addition of methanol to the methylterpinylether leads to the undesired cis- or trans-1,8-di- methoxy-p-menthane. The amount of unidentified products does not exceed 1% K.

At high temperatures and long reaction times the reverse reaction of the alpha-terpinyl methyl ether and the other addition products to limonene and its isomers can be observed. The reaction scheme of the alkoxyl- ation of limonene is illustrated in Scheme 2. The reaction pathway is identical to that of alpha-pinene alkoxylation except that bicyclic compounds are not formed. As mentioned in the literature [25,26], alkoxylation of limonene to 1-methyl- 4-[alpha-alkoxy-isopropyl]-l-cyclohexene can be carried out only in the pres- ence of acidic catalysts. The conversion, selectivity and product yields for limonene methoxylation in the presence of various acidic catalysts are presented in Table 1. In contrast to the zeolites employed for alkoxylation of limonene in the literature [25,26], medium pore zeolites like H-ferrierite or H-ZSM-5 and large pore zeolites like H-mordenite or various H-USY show only low activity. The selectivity to the desired product reaches values of about 70-80%. Only in the presence of a H-USY zeolite with the SiO2/AlzO3 ratio of 40, the limonene conversion increases to 57% in spite of a lower reaction temperature at a selectivity to alpha-terpinyl methyl ether of about 79%. Addition of methanol to limonene in the presence of beta zeolite produces the highest selectivity to 318 K. Hensen et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 311-329 1-methyl-4-[alpha-methoxy-isopropyl]- 1-cyclohexene of about 93% at 91% con- version. Surprisingly, the highest yield of about 85% has been obtained at room temperature. The acidic cation exchanger shows also good results for limonene methoxylation. At a reaction temperature of 60, 85% of limonene has been converted into various products in the presence of this catalyst. On account of the formation of several isomerisation products, the selectivity to the desired product decreases to 61%. The limonene conversion over the strongly acidic heteropolyacid H3040PW~2 aq. is about 100%, whereas the selectivity of alpha-terpinyl methyl ether is lower than 10%. In this case, the main reaction products are various isomerisation and polymerisation compounds. Thus, beta zeolite seems to be more active and selective for methoxylation of limonene than other catalysts described in the literature for this reaction type. The other zeolites and solid acids applied for the alkoxylation of limonene reveal considerably lower conversion and selectivity. It is interesting to note that the destruction of the structure of beta zeolite by treatment with strong acids or high temperature leads to a complete deactivation of the catalyst for limonene alkoxylation. By using a higher reaction temperature only isomerisation and polymerisation products have been obtained, l-methyl-4- [alpha-methoxy-isopropyl]-l-cyclohexene or other addition products cannot be found. The most likely reasons for the high activity of beta zeolite are the relatively high BET surface area of the catalyst (750 m2/g). Furthermore there are some hints by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of ammonia that a large amount of acid sites are present [30]. We assume that the alkoxylation of limonene takes place inside the pore structure of the beta zeolite. This will be proved by computer modeling and calculations [30]. The high selectivity of beta zeolite might be originated from suitable acid sites in pores of its defined size and shape. Further investigations about the active sites of the beta zeolite used for the reaction will be published soon [30]. On account of high activity and selectivity of beta zeolite and good product yields for limonene alkoxylation in the presence of this catalyst, the influence of various reaction conditions to optimize the reaction procedure are studied by using this beta zeolite. The dependence of limonene conversion and selectivity to 1-methyl-4-[alpha-methoxy-isopropyl]-l-cyclohexene over beta zeolite in a batch reactor on temperature is presented in Table 2. The influence of temperature on the reaction has been investigated within the temperature range from 25 to 80. Contrary to the temperature ranges described in literature [25,26], the optimum temperature has been found at 40 for the reaction time of 5 h. At this temperature, the highest selectivity of about 92% at 93% conversion has been obtained. Temperature above 40 results in a considerable selectivity reduction due to either consecutive reactions and decom- position of 1-methyl-4-[alpha-methoxy-isopropyl]-l-cyclohexene or other side reactions occurring even at a shorter reaction time. At a reaction temperature of K. Hensen et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 311-329 319 60 and a reaction time of 2 h a maximal conversion of 94% is reached. A higher temperature of 80 promote increasingly the reverse reaction of the alpha-terpinyl methyl ether to limonene and its isomers under elimination of the methanol, so that the conversion remains almost constant while the selectivity to the desired product decreases. Lower temperature results in a drop of the limonene conversion. However, the latter can be compensated by a longer reaction time. The selectivities obtained at lower reaction temperatures are up to 98%. The conversion, selectivity and product yield for the addition of other alcohols to limonene in the presence of the beta zeolite are presented in Table 3. As in the case of limonene methoxylation, the addition of higher alcohols delivers also the corresponding alpha-terpinyl alkyl ethers as the main reaction products. However, the conversions of limonene by using ethanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol or 1-pentanol are surprisingly lower than those with methanol. It would have been expected that in an electrophilic addition the longer-chain alcohols would be more reactive. The higher conversion when methanol is used is possibly due to lesser diffusion constraints. The maximum selectivity obtained for ethoxylation of limonene is 94% at 42% conversion. By increasing the chain length of the linear alcohols, a decrease of the selectivity was observed. This might be caused by sterical hindrance in the zeolite pore structure in such a way that longer alcohols do not easily form the transition state. Also, side reactions of limonene to its isomers occur. Good product yields are achieved only in the case of the linear alcohols, whereas for iso alcohols as 2-propanol, 2-butanol or 2-pentanol, a remarkable drop in limonene conversion and selectivity to corre- sponding alpha-terpinyl alkyl ethers is observed; with 2-methyl-2-propanol, no addition products have been found. The reason for those effects might again be sterical hinderance and diffusion restrictions in the elliptical pores of beta zeolite resulting in a lower reactivity. Moreover, branched and iso alcohols tend to dehydrate to corresponding alkenes and water. Thus, besides the desired product terpineol out of limonene and water has been found in the reaction mixture. In the case of the alpha-terpinyl ethers a side reaction might be the elimination of propene, butene, iso-butene and pentene resulting in the formation of alpha- terpineol. 3.1.2. Reaction in an integral continuous flow fixed bed reactor For methoxylation of limonene in the presence of beta zeolite in a continuous flow-type apparatus with an integral fixed bed reactor, the same tendencies as for the batch reactor are observed in general. The great advantage of the reaction in an integral continuous fixed bed reactor is the easy separation of the products from zeolite and, on the other hand, a higher productivity can be expected in a continuous process.

Influence of temperature on limonene conversion and selectivity to 1-methyl-4-[alpha-methoxy-isopro- pyl]-l-cyclohexene in an integral continuous flow fixed bed reactor. Conditions: p = 10 bar; WHSV = 2.2 h-l; methanol/limonene = 2:1 (mass ratio); 5 g beta zeolite. After a short increase at the beginning of the reaction the limonene conver- sion decreases within 9 h TOS. Surprisingly, at the highest and the lowest reaction temperature the conversion is almost constant. The highest limonene conversion obtained is about 95% at 80. The selectivity to the alpha-terpinyl methyl ether increases within 9 h TOS. However, the selectivity is lowered to 75% at 80 while at a lower temperature it increases to 95% during 9 h TOS. At the limonene conversion of about 60% and a reaction temperature decreased to 40, selectivities higher than 95% are achieved. A temperature lower than 40 causes a noticeable decrease of the limonene conversion. In spite of this, selectivity to alpha-terpinyl methyl ether remains on the same level of about 95%. The product distribution is nearly the same as in the batch reactor. Application of a moderate pressure of 10 bar in the integral fixed bed reactor does not influence significantly the limonene conversion or selectivity to the desired product, because the reaction takes place in the liquid phase. The chosen mass ratio between methanol and limonene of 2:1 is advanta- geous, because the feedstock and the products are well dissolved at this concentration. However, the excess of methanol can react with 1-methyl-4-[al- pha-methoxy-isopropyl]- 1-cyclohexene to cis- or trans- 1,8-dimethoxy-p- menthane in a consecutive reaction. This reaction is strongly accelerated when the limonene conversion exceeds 90%. That consecutive reaction together with the decomposition of the desired product and other side reactions decrease selectivity in spite of a high limonene conversion. All those facts indicate that consecutive reactions of the desired product are favoured if not enough limonene is available in the case of a high limonene conversion. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the reactivity of limonene with methanol is higher than that of K.

Therefore, it is advisable to limit the limonene conversion to about 90%. Nevertheless, the reduction of the amount of methanol to a ratio of 1:1 did not bring positive results. A slight increase in the selectivity to l-methyl-4-[al- pha-methoxy-isopropyl]-l-cyclohexene and an also a slight decrease in the consecutive reactions was indeed observed, but the reduction in the amount of methanol caused a drop of almost 50% in the limonene conversion. The relations between the WHSV (weight hourly space velocity) and limonene conversion and selectivity are presented in Table 4. In these experiments, the WHSV has been changed by varying the limonene/methanol feed rate in the presence of a constant amount of catalyst. The reduction of contact time with a higher WHSV causes a decrease of the limonene conversion. The selectivity to the alpha-terpinyl methyl ether increases with the reduction of the residence time. The experiments have revealed that not only higher reaction temperature and the limonene conversion above 90%, but also a longer contact time caused by a lower WHSV favour the consecutive reaction of the excess methanol with 1-methyl-4-[alpha-methoxy-isopropyl]-l- cyclohexene to cis-or trans-l,8-dimethoxy-p-menthane. The conversion, selectivity and product yield of the addition of other alcohols to limonene in the presence of beta zeolite are listed in Table 5.

Fig. 2 shows the catalyst service time at two different reaction temperatures as a function of time-on-stream. The catalyst service time can be increased by using a higher temperature as deactivating compounds desorb more easily at elevated temperatures. However, after an initially small increase, the limonene conversion decreases in 1 or 2 days. Therefore, attempts have been made to regenerate the deactivated catalyst. 3.1.3. Regeneration of beta zeolites For an industrial application, it is necessary that the catalyst can be regener- ated. In contrast to the reactions in the batch reactor where the catalyst has to be separated from the products and the regeneration must be done outside of reactor, in the integral continuous flow fixed bed reactor both the reaction and the regeneration can be carried out inside the reactor. The limonene conversion in the presence of the original catalyst and two samples regenerated with synthetic air as a function of time-on-stream are shown in Fig. 3. Beta zeolite used in this regeneration procedure is heated up with a heating rate of 1 K/min in the presence of synthetic air from the reaction temperature to 500 and kept at this temperature for 16 h. As can be seen from Fig. 3, the limonene conversion before and after regeneration is comparable and indicates a successful regeneration. Whereas initially the limonene conversion remains at the same level, a decline is observed within 30 h TOS. After the second regeneration, this decline becomes slightly faster. It is assumed that during the regeneration procedure with air or oxygen the intrinsic temperature inside the zeolite bed increases strongly due to burning off coke precursors and other K.

This high temperature is likely to partially destroy the pore structure of the zeolite so that the overall activity of zeolite decreases. Indeed, nitrogen adsorption measurements showed that the t-plot microporous volume decreased from 0.24 ml/g to 0.19 ml/g after the second regeneration. A solution for this problem is to limit the oxygen amount during the regeneration procedure. Fig. 4 shows the results of such regeneration procedure. The amount of oxygen in the regeneration gas is reduced by diluting air with nitrogen. The regenerating gas contains only 3.5% 02 and 96.5% N2.

Hensen et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 311-329 neously, the gas flow is raised. By this procedure, the limonene conversion as well as the decline of the conversion remain almost the same within 9 h. These milder regeneration conditions lead to the complete reactivation of the catalyst. Contrary to the limonene conversion, the selectivity to alpha-terpinyl methyl ether remains on the same high level of about 92% during 9 h time-on-stream and after four regeneration runs with a defined amount of oxygen. By applying the above described regeneration procedure it is possible to regain the complete activity and selectivity of beta zeolite which is of high interest for industrial production. 3.2. Alkoxylation of alpha-pinene 3.2.1. Reactions in the batch reactor The addition of methanol to alpha-pinene in the presence of the above mentioned beta zeolite as catalyst in the batch reactor results in the cleavage of the cyclobutane ring and yields 1-methyl-4-[alpha-methoxy-isopropyl]-l- cyclohexene (alpha-terpinyl methyl ether) as the main reaction product (see Scheme 2: R-= CH3-). The global reaction pathway, as suggested, based on the product distribution, is presented in Scheme 2. The most common by-products to be found are isomerization compounds like camphene, limonene and terpinolene, and several bicyclic and double addition products, e.g., endo- or exo-methylbomylether, endo- or exo-methylfenchylether and cis- or trans- l,8-dimethoxy-p-menthane. Depending on the reaction conditions, over 50% selectivity to the desired product can be achieved. The other methoxy compounds formed by the sec- ondary addition of methanol to the product or to various isomerisation products are obtained with 28% yield. By summarizing all addition products, the selectiv- ity of the methoxy compounds increases to about 79%. The reaction mixture contains only 20% of terpenes including the unreacted alpha-pinene. The amount of unidentified products does not exceed 1% and can therefore be neglected. The catalytic activity in the methoxylation of alpha-pinene over beta zeolite dependent on the temperature is presented in Table 6. The influence of temperature has been investigated within the range from 25 to 80. The optimum temperature for alpha-pinene methoxylation has been found at 40 at a reaction time of 5 h. At this temperature, the highest selectivity obtained over beta zeolite is about 54% at 92% conversion. A temperature above 40 gives significant reduction in selectivity due to the occurrence of consecutive reactions or decomposition of 1-methyl-4-[alpha- methoxy-isopropyl]-l-cyclohexene and other side reactions at even shorter reaction times. A lower temperature causes a drop of the alpha-pinene conver- sion. However, this can be compensated by a longer reaction time. The dependencies of temperature and reaction time are consistent with the K.

However, as can be seen from Table 2, selectivities up to 98% are obtained for limonene methoxylation, whereas the highest selectivity achieved for methoxylation of alpha-pinene amounts to 54%. On account of the above mentioned additional formation of various bicyclic addition products, the selectivities for all methoxy compounds increase to about 80%. This indicates that for the production of 1-methyl-4-[al- pha-methoxy-isopropyl]-l-cyclohexene beta zeolite is more selective for the addition of methanol to limonene than to alpha-pinene. The activity of the catalyst, however, is nearly the same for both reactions. Table 7 shows the effect of catalyst loading (g alpha-pinene/g catalyst) on the conversion of alpha-pinene and selectivity to 1-methyl-4-[alpha-methoxy- isopropyl]- 1-cyclohexene. The alpha-pinene conversion decreases with increase in catalyst loading from 5 to 50 g alpha-pinene per g catalyst. The selectivity increases gradually with Table 7 Influence of catalyst loading on alpha-pinene conversion and selectivity in a batch reactor Catalyst loading a 5 10 20 30 50 Conversion (%) (c~-pinene) 100 99.6 97.0 94.6 75.4 Selectivity (%) ( c~-terpinyl methyl ether) 26.9 36.0 47.1 48.2 49.3 Selectivity of all addition compounds (%) 77.3 77.9 71.1 70.1 66.0 Conditions: T= 80; t = 20 h; p = normal pressure; methanol/alpha-pinene = 2:1 (mass ratio): 2 g beta zeolite.

Hensen et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 311-329 the increase of catalyst loading and an alpha-terpinyl methyl ether selectivity of 50% is achieved at a loading of 50 g/g. The same effect can be noticed in Table 6: at high conversions, the alpha- terpinyl methyl ether selectivity decreases whereas the selectivity of all methoxy compounds increases. The mass ratio of methanol to alpha-pinene shows an excess of methanol during the reaction. As a result of the consecutive reaction between excess methanol and 1-methyl-4-[alpha-methoxy-isopropyl]-l-cyclohexene to cis- or trans-1,8-dimethoxy-p-menthane, the selectivity to the desired product decreases whereas the selectivity to all addition products increases. These consecutive reactions are favoured only if the amount of alpha-pinene is reduced as a result of a high conversion. As in the case of limonene methoxylation, alpha-pinene shows also a higher reactivity by the addition of methanol in the presence of beta zeolite than that of alpha-terpinyl methyl ether. As the ether itself can also react with methanol in the presence of beta zeolite, it seems advisable to limit the alpha-pinene conversion to about 90%. The use of equimolar amounts of methanol and alpha-pinene leads, as in the case of the alkoxylation of limonene, only to a decrease in conversion, but not to a significant increase in the selectivity to the corresponding alpha-terpinyl alkyl ethers. The results of the addition of other alcohols to alpha-pinene using beta zeolite as catalyst are presented in Table 8. As in the case of alpha-pinene methoxylation, the addition of ethanol or 1-propanol delivers similar alpha-pinene conversions and selectivities to corre- sponding alpha-terpinyl alkyl ethers.

K. Hensen et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 311-329 327 alpha-pinene ethoxylation is 57% at 98% conversion. As already noticed for alpha-pinene methoxylation, this alkoxylation results in the formation of various bicyclic and double addition products in parallel to the desired products. Using 2-propanol, a decrease in alpha-pinene conversion and selectivity was observed. As in the case of limonene alkoxylation, we assume that sterical hinderance and diffusion restrictions in the elliptical pores of beta zeolite causes less reactivity. In addition the iso-alcohols have the tendency to dehydrate to the corresponding alkenes and water. In the case of alpha-terpinyl isopropyl ether, a side reaction might be also the elimination of propene resulting in the formation of alpha- terpineol. 3.2.2. Reactions in the integral continuous flow fixed bed reactor Methoxylation of alpha-pinene in the continuous flow-type apparatus with an integral fixed bed reactor over beta zeolite as catalyst shows very similar results as in the batch reactor. The great advantage of the fixed bed reactor was already mentioned above. Fig. 5 shows the alpha-pinene conversion and the selectivity to 1-methyl-4-[alpha-methoxy-isopropyl]-l-cyclohexene at different reaction temperatures as a function of time-on-stream. The dependence of alpha-pinene conversion and selectivity to the alpha- terpinyl methyl ether on temperature and time-on-stream are in agreement with observations for limonene methoxylation. For the temperature range studied, the alpha-pinene conversion decreases within 9 h TOS. The highest alpha-pinene conversion of about 98% is obtained at a reaction temperature of 80. However, at this temperature, the selectivity to the alpha-terpinyl methyl ether is lowered to 40% due to consecutive reactions or decomposition of 1-methyl-4- [alpha-methoxy-isopropyl]-l-cyclohexene and other side reactions.

Hensen et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 311-329 perature causes a stronger decrease of the alpha-pinene conversion, whereas the selectivity increases. The highest selectivity obtained is of about 51% at 85% conversion and 40. At this reaction temperature the selectivity is constant for the TOS used. The product distribution is nearly the same as in the batch reactor. As mentioned for the limonene alkoxylation a moderate pressure of 10 bar applied in the flow reactor does not show any significant influence on the alpha-pinene conversion and selectivity to the alpha-terpinyl methyl ether. 4. Conclusions The heterogeneously catalyzed alkoxylation of alpha-pinene and limonene over beta zeolite provides excellent results in both a discontinuous batch reactor and a continuous flow-type apparatus with a fixed bed reactor. In both reactors, the use of methanol as addition compound and limonene as feedstock gives 1-methyl-4-[alpha-methoxy-isopropyl]-l-cyclohexene with the yield of 85% (conversion: 93%, selectivity: 92%). By means of variation of the reaction parameters, the limonene conversion can be adjusted within the range 40-90%. The selectivity to 1-methyl-4-[alpha-methoxy-isopropyl]-l-cyclohexene remains always about 95%. For mixtures of methanol and alpha-pinene, the highest yield of correspond- ing alpha-terpinyl methyl ether is only of about 50% (conversion: 99%, selectiv- ity: 51%) in both reactor types, as several bicyclic and double addition products are formed in parallel. The selectivity of all addition products can reach values of about 85%. In the case of limonene and alpha-pinene alkoxylation with higher alcohols (C2-C5 alcohols), good results are obtained by using linear alcohols only. Other (iso- and branched) alcohols tend to dehydrate to corresponding alkenes and water. This might also reflect a shape selective effect. Alkoxylation of alpha-pinene or limonene in the presence of other large pore zeolites, e.g., H-USY or H-mordenite, and solid acids, e.g., ion exchanger or heteropolyacids, results in a considerable selectivity reduction to the correspond- ing alpha-terpinyl alkyl ethers. The destruction of the structure of beta zeolite leads to a complete deactivation of the catalyst. The beta zeolite is more active as well as more selective than all other catalysts described in the literature for this reaction type. The most likely reasons for the high activity of beta zeolite are the relatively high BET surface area of the catalyst and the large amount of acid sites measured by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of ammonia [30]. We assume that the alkoxylation of limonene takes place inside the pore structure of the beta zeolite. We also assume that the high selectivity of beta zeolite originates from suitable acid sites in pores of its defined size and shape. Further investigations about the active sites of beta zeolite are in preparation [301. K. Hensen et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 311-329 329 By using a defined amount of oxygen and air in nitrogen as the regenerating gas at a temperature of about 500 (heating rate of 1 K/min), it is possible to regain the complete activity and selectivity of the catalysts. The high activity and selectivity of beta zeolite in an integral continuous fixed bed reactor and the possibility to regenerate this catalyst in the same reactor make an industrial application feasible.

The heterogeneously catalyzed alkoxylation of limonene and alpha-pinene with C1–C5 alcohols to 1-methyl-4-[alpha-alkoxy-isopropyl]-1-cyclohexene in the presence of beta zeolite in liquid phase has been studied in both a discontinuous batch reactor and a continuous flow-type apparatus with a fixed bed reactor. In both reactor types, methanol and limonene as feedstock react to 1-methyl-4-[alpha-methoxy-isopropyl]-1-cyclohexene with a yield of about 85%. Thus, the beta zeolite seems to be more active and selective for methoxylation of limonene than other catalysts described in the literature for this reaction type. For the methoxylation of alpha-pinene, however, the highest yield of the corresponding alpha-terpinyl methyl ether is only up to 50% in both reactor types, as several bicyclic and double addition products are formed in parallel. The selectivity for all addition products together can reach values of about 85%. The other zeolites and solid acids applied for the methoxylation of alpha-pinene reveal considerably lower conversion and selectivity. We discuss the dependencies of conversion, selectivity and product distribution on temperature, WHSV, TOS, pressure and the starting material ratio. The possibility for a regeneration of beta zeolite with air or oxygen is shown as well. Different linear and branched alcohols (C1–C5 alcohols) are compared in relation to their activity for the heterogeneously catalyzed alkoxylation of limonene and alpha-pinene.
