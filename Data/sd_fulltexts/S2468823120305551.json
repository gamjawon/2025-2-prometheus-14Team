Graphical abstract Quaternary ammonium salts bearing different alkyl chains and hydroxyl groups were synthesized and tested for the first time as co-catalysts in the cycloaddition reaction between CO2 and propylene oxide. Their synergetic catalytic effect together with the known tetranuclear zinc(II) complex [Zn4(μ3 -OH)2 (1κO:2κO-HL)4(κO-HL)2(H2O)4] (1), H2L = 3-(2-carboxyphenyl-hydrazone)pentane-2,4-dione, was investigated at 60 °C and 4 MPa. Results obtained highlight the importance of exploring the hydrogen bonding effect via functionalization with hydroxyl groups but show that the length of the alkyl chains of the ammonium cation is a more relevant factor affecting the reaction kinetic for the system studied. Keywords CO2 utilization epoxides organic carbonates propylene carbonate ionic liquids catalysis arylhydrazones of B-diketones Introduction Carbon dioxide (CO2) has been widely explored as feedstock in the production of cyclic carbonates [1,2]. In recent years, the importance of this topic has grown significantly due to the belief that being a versatile molecule, cyclic carbonates may become a platform to introduce CO2 as a renewable feedstock into different areas of the chemical sector. Indeed, cyclic carbonates are already in use as polar aprotic solvents, fuel additives, electrolytes for lithium batteries, fine chemicals intermediates, as well as monomers in the production of polymers [3]. One of the most attractive routes to produce cyclic carbonates is the atom economic coupling reaction between CO2 and highly energetic epoxides. Binary catalytic systems composed of homogeneous metal complexes together with ionic liquids have been successfully used [4–7]. It was reported that due to a synergetic effect, various cyclic carbonates could be produced from corresponding epoxides even at room temperature with good yields [8]. Theoretical DFT calculations have determined considerably lower energy barriers which may be crucial for the future implementation of the process using less reactive epoxides, namely bio-based ones [9]. The ionic liquid plays a crucial role in the reaction kinetics, with the anion being responsible for the nucleophilic attack to the epoxide ring, which is the rate-determining step, and the cation contributing for the stabilization of the ring-opened alkoxide intermediate [10–14]. Halides are the most active anions, due to their strong nucleophilic character, with the activity depending on both the nucleophilicity and leaving group ability. Furthermore, it is well known that the cation possesses determinant influence on the anion reactivity. Bulky organic cations can contribute to keep the anion away from the structure centre, exhibiting weaker electrostatic interactions, which leaves the anion more available for the nucleophilic attack. Several reviews have reported the most important advances made in this field [15–17]. In this context, tetraalkylammonium halides have been one of the most explored organic salts due to the bulkiness of the tetrahedral ammonium ion, commercial availability and simple functionalization. The most common strategy to increase the catalytic activity of these organic salts was first reported by Sun et al. in 2008 [18], comprising the functionalization of the cation alkyl chains with hydroxyl groups. These hydroxyl-functionalised tetraalkylammonium halides achieved yields of 20–30 % higher than unfunctionalized ones. The reaction mechanism have been investigated with evidences showing that the ring opening was promoted both by the nucleophilic attack on the carbon atom of the epoxide from the anion, along with the hydrogen bond formed between the oxygen atom of the epoxide and the hydroxyl group of the cation [19]. In a subsequent work, the same authors have showed that the tetraalkylammonium salt activity increased with the increasing number of hydroxyl groups until a maximum number of three groups and that interestingly, the catalytic activity decreased when the tetraalkylammonium cation was functionalised with four hydroxyl groups. The authors emphasized the fact that although the hydroxyl group clearly favours the reaction kinetics, the catalytic activity was not strictly proportional to the number of the hydroxyl functionalised groups [20]. In the same year, Buttner and Werner reported an additional crucial factor to be the distance between the nitrogen centre and the alcohol moiety [21]. In fact, when the chain bearing the alcohol function was reduced from butyl to propyl, the reaction yield decreased. Theoretical calculations have been explored to predict the catalytic activity of hydroxyl and multi-hydroxyl functionalised ionic liquids [22–24]. Despite modulation’s important advances recently made, as using more than one ion pair to consider the effect of hydrogen bond interactions in the reaction mechanism, the type of hydroxyl-functionalised quaternary ammonium catalysts reported in the literature is still very limited to achieve consistent predictions [23]. As part of our interest in exploring zinc(II) complexes of arylhydrazones of β-diketones (Zn(II)-AHBDs) as homogeneous catalysts for the coupling reaction between CO2 and epoxides, we have previously reported the activity of known tetranuclear zinc(II) complex, [Zn4(μ3 -OH)2 (1κO:2κO-HL)4(κO-HL)2(H2O)4] (1), H2L = 3-(2-carboxyphenyl-hydrazone)pentane-2,4-dione as catalyst for the cycloaddition reaction between CO2 and styrene oxide [25]. Arylhydrazones of β-diketones (AHBD) are an attractive type of ligand due to their rich chelating ability, high stability and straightforward preparation from cheap starting materials, as aromatic amines and β-diketones. Several metal-AHBD complexes have been reported to have further interesting catalytic activities in reactions such as the Henry reaction or in the oxidation of alkanes and alcohols [26–28]. In this work a comparative study on the activity of different hydroxyl-functionalised quaternary ammonium salts as co-catalysts together with known tetranuclear Zn(II)-AHBD complex in the coupling reaction between CO2 and propylene oxide was performed. Experimental section Materials All chemicals and solvents were used as received without further purification. Carbon dioxide (99.998 mol % purity) was supplied by Air Liquid. Propylene oxide (99.5 % purity), bis(triphenylphosphine)iminium chloride ([PPN]Cl) (≥ 97 % purity), tetrabutylammonium bromide ([TBA]Br) (≥ 98 % purity), tetrabutylammonium chloride ([TBA]Cl) (≥ 97 % purity), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide ([EMIm]Br) (≥ 97 % purity), choline chloride ([Chol]Cl) (≥ 99 % purity) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. All functionalised tetralkylammonium salts were synthesized by Solchemar (see support information). Zn(II)-AHBD complex was synthesized as previously reported [25–27]. Methods Propylene carbonate synthesis were performed using the same experimental procedure described in detail in previous works [25,29,30]. The reactor is a stainless-steel cylinder with a volume of approximately 10 cm3. The top and bottom of the reactor is equipped with two sapphire windows which allow the visualization of the entire reactor volume [31,32]. The catalytic procedure consisted in loading the reactor with propylene oxide (1 mL), metal catalyst, ionic liquid, and a magnetic stirring bar. Temperature was controlled using a thermostatic water bath in which the reactor was immersed and that maintained the temperature within ± 0.1 °C. Finally, CO2 was introduced into the reactor using a CO2-compressor. Pressure was measured with a pressure transducer 204 Setra calibrated between 0 MPa and 34.3 MPa (precision: 0.1 %; accuracy: 0.15 %, at the lowest pressure). At the end of the reaction, the high-pressure reactor was first slowly cooled and very slowly depressurized to atmospheric pressure. A glass trap immersed on an ice bath was used to assure that no substrate or product was lost within the CO2 flow. For analytic purposes, a sample of the reaction mixture, was transferred into an NMR tube, to which chloroform-d1 was added. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker 500 MHz type (400 MHz). Peak frequencies were compared against solvent, chloroform-d1 at 7.26 ppm. The epoxide conversion and product yield were determined by integrating the relevant peaks in the 1H NMR spectra. All liquid solutions were prepared gravimetrically using analytical balance (Sartorius model R180D) with the precision of ±0.0001 g. Results and discussion Following our interest in using Zn(II)-AHBD complexes as homogeneous catalysts for the CO2 cycloaddition reaction to epoxides [25], in this work the activity of different hydroxyl-functionalised quaternary ammonium salts as co-catalysts was investigated (Fig. 1). For comparative purposes, all reactions were performed in a high-pressure apparatus at a fixed pressure of 4 MPa. The effect of pressure on the reaction kinetics was reported in previous works [25,29,30]. CO2 pressure increases the reaction rate up to around 50 bar, after which, the reaction mixture starts to volumetric expand and the dilution effect negatively impacts the reaction kinetics. Therefore, and in order to have a good control of the rection pressure in the existing experimental apparatus, 4 MPa was established as the operational pressure to carry out all reactions in this study. Propylene oxide was used as a model substrate and preliminary experiments at different temperatures and various Zn(II)-AHBD and [TBA]Br loadings were performed for 3 h in order to characterize the reaction system (scheme 1 ). Results presented in Fig. 2 show the catalytic effect of Zn(II)-AHBD on the reaction kinetics for a fixed amount of [TBA]Br of 1 mol % in relation to the substrate. For higher temperatures (60 and 80 °C), it is possible to observe that the reaction proceeds even in the absence of a metal complex. However, for 80 °C, the addition of only 0.05 mol % of Zn(II)-AHBD drastically increased propylene carbonate formation from 25 % to 95 %. On the other hand, for lower temperatures, the need for a metal catalyst becomes more evident and at 40 °C the reaction simply did not occur without the presence of Zn(II)-AHBD. Moreover, an increase in the amount of metal catalyst in relation to [TBA]Br, increased propylene carbonate formation, although a maximum seems to be reached, after which there is no advantage in increasing the amount of metal complex. This behaviour was earlier observed by us for styrene oxide and is related with the importance of the metal/nucleophile ratio, also reported by other authors [25]. For higher Zn-AHBD loadings, a slight PC formation decrease was observed. Actually, at Zn-AHBD concentration of 0.25 mol % the solubility limit of the catalyst in the reaction mixture was largely exceeded. The increase of solids in the reaction mixture increases it viscosity, which negatively impacts the reaction rate. Fig. 3 shows the effect of increasing [TBA]Br molar percentage, for a fixed amount of Zn(II)-AHBD. It is possible to observe that for all temperatures studied, the reaction did not occur without the presence of the organic salt and that for the concentrations studied, an increase in [TBA]Br molar percentage had always a positive effect on the reaction kinetics. These results highlight the crucial role of [TBA]Br in the rate-determining reaction step attributed to nucleophilic attack and the opening of the epoxide ring. The metal complex, in its turn, considerably facilitated this step, by lowering the activation energy of the reaction, although it did not catalyse the reaction alone. This is the reason why, for a fixed amount of [TBA]Br, there is a limit after which there is no advantage in increasing the concentration of the metal complex. These results are in accordance with the most general accepted reaction mechanism in which the metal complex activates the epoxide, facilitating the ring opening step by the nucleophile [25]. Furthermore, also the activity of some commercially available organic salts widely reported in literature was investigated. Reactions were performed for 3 h, in neat propylene oxide at 60 °C and 4 MPa. Results are presented in Table 1 . Results obtained for propylene carbonate formation revealed a significant difference concerning the catalytic performance of [TBA]Br compared with the other commercial organic salts tested. This higher catalytic activity is clearly due to the bulkiness of the tetrahedral ammonium cation in combination with the bromide anion which, for the experimental conditions studied, presented a higher activity compared to chloride. On the other hand, the low performance of the [EMIM] structure results from the high charge stabilization between species, which makes the strength of ionic bond between the planar five-member ring [EMIM] and bromide, stronger than the interaction between [TBA] and bromide. In addition, also the bis(triphenylphosphine)iminium cation presented a very good catalytic performance in opposition to the choline cation that showed the lowest catalytic activity. Finally, a comparative study on the catalytic effect of several hydroxyl-functionalised quaternary ammonium salts together with homogeneous Zn(II)-AHBD was investigated. A series of hydroxyl-functionalised quaternary ammonium salts were synthesized and applied as co-catalysts for the reaction under study. The selection of the reaction temperature and catalyst loading was based on the above presented results in order to be possible to either detect a positive or a negative effect on final PC formation. These conditions correspond to 60 °C; 0.05 mol % of Zn and 0.4 mol % of co-catalyst, for which 48 % of PC formation was attained using [TBA]Br as co-catalyst. In Fig. 4 a series of quaternary ammonium salts bearing ethyl and hydroxyethyl substituents were investigated. It was observed that for the experimental conditions studied, the increase in the number of hydroxyl groups had only a slight positive effect on the catalytic activity. Contrasting with the results reported by Chen et al. [20], the activity decreased when the tetraalkylammonium cation was functionalised with three hydroxyl groups. Furthermore, when one hydroxyl group is present and an ethyl substituent is replaced by a hexyl unit, the increase in the catalytic activity was strongly pronounced, highlighting the predominant effect of electrostatic interaction over the hydrogen bonding. Additionally, in Fig. 5 , a different series of quaternary ammonium salts bearing methyl, hydroxyethyl and hydroxy-isopropyl substituents were investigated. The replacement of a hydroxyethyl group by a hydroxypropyl group was earlier reported to have a negative effect on the reaction kinetics due to the increase in the distance between the N atom and the hydroxyl group [21]. However, the effect of a hydroxy-isopropyl substituent was never investigated. At the experimental conditions studied in this work, the replacement of the hydroxyethyl group by a hydroxy-isopropyl group resulted in a clear increase in the catalytic activity. This positive effect was only slightly observed for the first two entries in Fig. 4. However, when comparing the activity of [N1,1,6,2OH]Br versus [N1,1,4, iso -3OH]Br, it can be observed that although the latter bears a shorter alkyl chain, a higher catalytic activity was registered due to the presence of the hydroxy-isopropyl group. Once again it was the combination of only one hydroxyl group with a longer alkyl unit that rendered the best catalytic activity. Moreover, the catalytic activity observed for the simple tetrabutylammonium bromide ([TBA]Br) was higher than those achieved for all the tested hydroxyl-functionalized tetraalakylammonium salts, what eventually can be accounted for by the competitive coordination of the alcohol functional group of the latter ILs to the Zn(II) metal centre, thus hampering the epoxide coordination required to its activation towards nucleophilic attack by the halide. Conclusions In this work, the synergetic catalytic effect of several hydroxyl-functionalised quaternary ammonium salts together with homogeneous tetranuclear zinc(II) complex was investigated. The length of the alkyl chains of the ammonium cation (electrostatic interactions) showed to be a more relevant factor affecting the reaction kinetic than the number of hydroxyl groups (hydrogen bonding effect). However, the best catalytic activity was attained when both effects were combined by functionalizing the ammonium cation with a longer alkyl chain and only one hydroxyl group. Regarding the hydroxyl functionalization, the replacement of a hydroxyethyl group by a hydroxy-isopropyl group was studied for the first time and revealed to have a significant positive effect in the reaction kinetics.

        "dc:description": "Quaternary ammonium salts bearing different alkyl chains and hydroxyl groups were synthesized and tested for the first time as co-catalysts in the cycloaddition reaction between CO2 and propylene oxide. Their synergetic catalytic effect together with the known tetranuclear zinc(II) complex [Zn4(μ3 -OH)2 (1κO:2κO-HL)4(κO-HL)2(H2O)4] (1), H2L = 3-(2-carboxyphenyl-hydrazone)pentane-2,4-dione, was investigated at 60 °C and 4 MPa. Results obtained highlight the importance of exploring the hydrogen bonding effect via functionalization with hydroxyl groups but show that the length of the alkyl chains of the ammonium cation is a more relevant factor affecting the reaction kinetic for the system studied.",
