DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(10)60223-9 Cu/SiO 2 Catalysts Prepared by the Sol-Gel Method for Hydrogenation of Dimethyl Oxalate to Ethylene Glycol LIN Ling, PAN Pengbin, ZHOU Zhangfeng, LI Zhaoji, YANG Jinxia, SUN Minling, YAO Yuangen* State Key Laboratory of Structural Chemical Chemistry, Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, China Abstract: A series of Cu/SiO 2 catalysts for the hydrogenation of dimethyl oxalate to ethylene glycol were prepared by the sol-gel method. Under optimized hydrogenation conditions, dimethyl oxalate conversion and ethylene glycol selectivity were found to reach 99.9% and 95.0%, respectively, upon varying the copper loading between 15% and 25%. The prepared catalysts were characterized by N 2 -physisorption, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, H 2 -temperature-programmed reduction, N 2 O titration, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results show that when the copper loading was increased under the same experimental conditions the factors that mostly affect the activities of the catalysts prepared by the sol-gel method are encapsulation and agglomeration. The encapsu- lation of silica is strong and it becomes the major factor when w(Cu) Â” 10% while agglomeration among the copper species on the catalyst surface becomes more serious and is a major factor when w(Cu) > 10%. These two factors influence the surface structure, the morphology of the copper species, and the chemicals surroundings the catalysts and as a result the performance of the catalysts is affected too. Key words: sol-gel method; dimethyl oxalate; hydrogenation; copper; silica; ethylene glycol; encapsulation; agglomeration As an important chemical material, ethylene glycol (EG) is currently prepared by ethylene oxidation. However, as crude oil resources gradually decrease the development and use of abundant coal and natural gas resources is strategically and economically significant in China. Currently, the synthesis of EG from syngas can be divided into a direct and an indirect synthesis process. The direct synthesis process requires noble metal catalysts, high reaction temperatures and pressures, and it is far from being industrialized. The indirect synthesis process includes the coupling of CO with nitrite esters to form diethyl oxalate followed by the hydrogenation of diethyl ox- alate. Interesting work has been done on oxalate hydrogenation [1â€“4]. Because of the moderate reaction conditions large-scale industrial application is promising. The Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has developed a series of core catalysts for a â€œcoal to ethylene glycolâ€� process and their technology includes independent intellectual property rights obtained from over 20 years of research. The â€œcoal to ethylene glycolâ€� technology with a production capacity of 1 million tons of EG a year passed an appraisal by CAS in March 2009. An industrial demonstration unit with a production capacity of 20 million tons EG in a year has been built in Tongliao, Inner Mongolia, China. Copper chromite catalysts are highly active catalysts for the synthesis of EG from syngas but the toxicity of Cr severely limits its practical application. Therefore, the research and development of environment friendly and efficient ester hy- drogenation catalysts is urgent. Cu/SiO 2 catalysts have shown good activities toward the hydrogenation of dimethyl and diethyl oxalate [5â€“7], and these have been prepared by methods such as aqueous impregnation, deposition precipitation, ion exchange, and the silicate ester sol-gel method [5â€“10]. The sol-gel technique offers advantages such as the effective in- corporation of the Cu species into the ionic oxide network, and this leads to the formation of a catalyst with a Cu loading of up to 10%. The prepared catalysts exhibit high stability and metal dispersion. However, lower activities are usually observed LIN Ling et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 957â€“969 because of encapsulation in some sol-gel catalysts [11â€“14]. Based on previous work, the copper loading of the catalysts prepared by the sol-gel technique was found to be less than 10% and reports about the application of these catalysts to the hydrogenation reaction of dimethyl or diethyl oxalate are rare. Therefore, we prepared a series of catalysts with different copper loadings by the sol-gel technique and used them for the catalytic hydrogenation reaction of dimethyl oxalate. The physical and chemical properties of the Cu/SiO 2 catalysts with the different copper loadings were systematically characterized and we discuss the factors that influence the catalytic activity. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation Cupric nitrate trihydrate (AR, Shanghai Country Medicine Group) was dissolved in deionized water and then tetraethy- lorthosilicate (TEOS, AR, Shanghai Country Medicine Group) as well as ethanol (AR, Shanghai Country Medicine Group) were added under stirring. The solution was placed in a 50 Â°C water bath for 6 h to generate a gel followed by aging, drying, calcination, and reduction to produce the Cu/SiO 2 catalysts. The copper content of the catalysts were 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, and 40%, respectively. The copper loading of the catalysts was calculated using the following equation: w(Cu) = w Cu /(w Cu +w SiO2 ), where w Cu is the weight of metallic copper calculated from the amount of cupric nitrate trihydrate actually used; w SiO2 is the weight of SiO 2 calculated from the amount of TEOS actually used. 1.2 Catalyst characterization The specific surface area and pore volume of the catalysts were determined by nitrogen adsorption using a Micromeritics Tristar 3020. The samples were pretreated at 150 qC for 2 h in vacuum. The specific surface area was obtained based on the BET method. The pore volume of the mesoporous material and its pore size distribution were calculated by the BJH method while the micropore volume was determined by the t-plot method. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were ob- tained using a Japan JEM-2010 transmission electron micro- scope equipped with a Gatan-794MSC CCD camera system, a Gatan-676TV system, and an OXFORD-INCA ultra-thin window EDS system. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Rigaku Rotaflex D/Max-C X-ray diffractometer using Cu K Ä® radiation and the tube voltage was 40 kV while the current was 30 mA. The XRD data were collected between 2È™ = 10Â°â€“80Â° at a scan speed of 3Â°/min. H 2 -temperature-programmed reduction (H 2 -TPR) was car- ried out using a Micromeritics AutoChemII 2920 (with a Hidden mass spectrometer QIC 20) with 50 mg of a calcined Cu/SiO 2 sample that had been outgassed at 100 Â°C under 5% H 2 -95% Ar for 60 min. After cooling to room temperature under 5% H 2 -95% Ar the sample was heated to 700 Â°C at a ramping rate of 10 Â°C/min. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray induced Auger electron spectroscopy (XAES) were obtained using a VG MultiLab 2000 analyzer with a Mg K Ä® radiation source and the binding energies were referenced to C 1s (284.6 eV). The metallic Cu surface area was measured using a Micro- meritics AutoChemII 2920 and the catalyst was reduced with H 2 at 350 Â°C over 2 h. Surface oxidation was performed by bringing nitrous oxide (5% N 2 O/Ar) into contact with the re- duced catalysts at 60 Â°C for 0.5 h. We assumed that all the surface copper atoms were oxidized from Cu 0 to Cu + . Cu + was then reduced by a pulsed method with H 2 and the consumption of H 2 was determined using a TCD. An adsorption stoichiometry of two Cu atoms per O atom and a Cu surface density of 1.46 Ã—10 19 Cu atom/m 2 were assumed. The bulk composition was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP) and the test was carried out using an Ultima2 plasma emission spectrometer from Jobin Yvon. 1.3 Catalyst testing Activity tests were carried out in a continuous flow system equipped with a stainless steel fixed-bed tubular reactor (inner diameter and length were 14 mm and 490 mm, respectively). The amount of catalyst (20â€“40 mesh) used was 5.6 g, the height of the catalyst bed was about 70 mm and both sides of the catalyst bed were packed with porcelain rings. The catalyst was activated in a H 2 atmosphere under the following conditions: pressure 1.0 MPa, flow rate 500 ml/min, temperature 250 Â°C for 5 h at a ramping rate of 1 Â°C/min. After cooling to 220 Â°C, 0.2 g dimethyl oxalate (DMO) in 1 ml methanol and H 2 were fed into the reactor at a H 2 /DMO molar ratio of 50â€“80 under a system pressure of 2.5 MPa. The liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) of DMO was controlled between 0.2 to 0.5 h 1 . The products were condensed and analyzed by gas chromatography after 5 h time on stream. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Textural properties and crystalline phase of the cata- lysts The physicochemical properties of the catalysts with dif- ferent copper loading are summarized in Table 1. The specific surface areas initially increased with an increase in copper loading and decreased gradually at higher than 10%. The spe- cific surface area of the catalysts decreased to about 400 m 2 /g and when the copper loading was increased to 40% it decreased LIN Ling et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 957â€“969 to 273 m 2 /g. The pore volumes and pore diameters all increased initially with an increase in copper loading and the maximum pore volume was 0.43 cm 3 /g when the copper loading was 15%. The maximum pore size was 4.14 nm when the copper loading was 25% and these values decreased when the copper loading was increased further. Nevertheless, these values in- creased again when the copper loading was 40%. The real copper loading, as determined by ICP, was far less than that calculated based on the amount of cupric nitrate tri- hydrate used apart from the 5%Cu/SiO 2 and 40%Cu/SiO 2 samples and these results imply that the catalysts contained a certain amount of hydroxyl groups. At a copper loading of less than 10% the catalyst prepared by the sol-gel method was found to be green in the presence of cupric ions Cu 2+ and these were incorporated into the silica gel matrix and, therefore, no separate CuO phase was formed during calcination [16â€“18]. When the copper loading was higher than 10%, the color of the catalysts changed from green to black and this shows that the concentration of CuO increased as the copper loading increased. Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of the calcined Cu/SiO 2 samples before and after reduction. The peak at 2È™ = 22.0Â° belongs to amorphous silica. For a copper loading lower than 10% the copper oxide signal is absence for the catalysts before reduction and the catalysts after reduction showed a dramati- cally weakened diffraction peak at 2È™ = 43.3Â°. For a copper loading between 10% and 30% the catalysts before reduction show strong diffraction peaks that come from CuO and all the peaks become stronger as the copper loading increases. Ac- cordingly, the diffraction peaks from Cu 0 become strong as the copper loading increases. In addition, a weak diffraction peak from Cu 2 O is present at 2È™ = 36.5Â° and it becomes stronger as the copper loading increases and this indicates that a portion of the copper exists as Cu + after reduction. Table 1 shows that the average diameters of the CuO and Cu 0 species all increase as the copper loading increases while the diameter of Cu 0 be- comes larger than that of CuO. This indicates that agglomera- tion of the copper species may take place during the reduction process. When the copper loading is higher than 30%, and especially when raised to 40%, the peaks from CuO and Cu 0 all strengthen and the average diameters of the CuO and Cu 0 species, as estimated from the XRD data, reaches 32.0 nm and 43.7 nm, respectively. This also shows that the agglomeration was very serious. The average diameter of CuO in the 30%Cu/SiO 2 sample was obviously less than those of the 20%Cu/SiO 2 and 25%Cu/SiO 2 samples. The copper loading measured by ICP corresponds to the copper loading calculated from the amount of cupric nitrate trihydrate actually used for the 40%Cu/SiO 2 sample. Additionally, the BET results show that the pore diameter of the 40%Cu/SiO 2 sample corresponds to that of pure SiO 2 . It seems that the high copper content resulted in the destruction of the silica gel skeleton leading to the separation of the copper species from silica. From the above XRD analysis we determined that the copper species on the surface was dispersed very well or that the CuO species was very small when w(Cu) Â” 10%. The surface CuO diameter increased as the copper loading increased and a peak specific to the copper crystallite phase was found when w(Cu) >10%.

LIN Ling et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 957â€“969 2.2 Morphology of the catalysts TEM images of the catalysts with different copper loadings are shown in Fig. 2. When the copper loading is lower than 10%, small copper particles with diameters of ca. 3 nm were homogeneously dispersed in the silica matrix as shown in the TEM image. In the low magnification TEM image the clear copper species was difficult to find for the 5%Cu/SiO 2 sample and a copper species that was embedded in silica gel was ob- served for the 10%Cu/SiO 2 sample. This shows that the ag- glomeration of the copper species was weak while encapsula- tion by silica was very strong. XRD results show that a strong CuO diffraction peak was observed when the copper loading was higher than 10% and the peak became stronger as the copper loading was increased. Clear single CuO crystallite particles were difficult to find while a clear lattice stripe was observed especially in the TEM image of the 20%Cu/SiO 2 sample and the average diameter of the CuO crystallite particles was about 5â€“20 nm while the diameter of the agglomerated CuO crystallites were larger than 20 nm for the 30%Cu/SiO 2 and 40%Cu/SiO 2 samples. This shows that agglomeration in the samples was serious. The agglomerated CuO species of different size are easily observed in the TEM images and agglomeration among the CuO crys- tallite particles became more obvious as the copper loading increased. Single-crystallite CuO was observed when the copper loading was higher than 25% and its diameter became larger than 100 nm while some of the CuO single-crystallite particles that separated from the silica gel were also observed. We found that the single-crystallite CuO that separated from the silica gel was reduced with more difficulty than the sup- ported CuO phase. The average diameter of the 30%Cu/SiO 2 sample was less than that of the 20%Cu/SiO 2 and 25%Cu/SiO 2 samples but the agglomeration was more obvious. Moreover, a considerable amount of single-crystallite CuO particles were present in the 30%Cu/SiO 2 sample, which may affect its activity. Lambert et al. [19] reported that large copper particles (> 8 nm) catalyze the reaction and that small copper particles (2â€“3 nm) are completely inactive during the dehydrogenation of 2-butanol. 2.3 H 2 -TPR results The observed shift in reduction temperature may be because of the different copper particle sizes, the different interactions between the copper oxide and silica, and the different copper oxide dispersions. Chen et al. [20] reported that the lack of reduction peaks at temperatures lower than 200 Â°C indicated the absence of oxocations [Cu-O-Cu] 2+ while the lack of peaks at temperatures higher than 260 Â°C indicated the absence of a (e) (a) (b) (c) (d) (f) Fig. 2.

The w(Cu) < 8% catalysts were prepared by the chemisorption-hydrolysis method, which ensured the formation of a unique copper phase that was well dispersed over all the supports [21]. Dow et al. [22] investigated the TPR of supported CuO under hydrogen. For copper oxide supported on È–-Al 2 O 3 the highly dispersed copper species include isolated Cu 2+ ions that strongly interact with the support and isolated Cu 2+ that weakly interact with the support (cupric ions are in close contact with each other) as well as small two-dimensional clusters or three-dimensional clusters. Wang et al. [11] reported that for a sol-gel catalyst only two peaks were present in the low temperature region. Compared with the impregnation catalyst in the TPR profile this shows that highly dispersed Cu(II) species and small clusters exist in the sol-gel catalyst. Three TPR peaks were observed in the impregnation catalyst and the strong peak was assigned to the reduction of larger CuO clusters. Yin et al. [23] pointed out that the formation of large CuO crystallites is most probably due to a poor interac- tion between Cu 2+ and the surface of the silica support under higher acidity. Kundakovic et al. [24] reported that copper is present as highly dispersed clusters or as isolated copper ions, which could interact strongly with the support at a low copper loading. Lu et al. [18] reported that reduction peaks at 320 and 400 Â°C were due to the formation of a Si-O-Cu species. From the above and Fig. 3, the copper species are highly dispersed in the precursor when w(Cu) Â” 15%, and they are not only highly dispersed the CuO crystallite but small CuO crys- tallites also exist in the catalysts when w(Cu) > 15% while the copper species also include bulk-like CuO when w(Cu) > 30%. For w(Cu) = 5% the peak at 225 Â°C is attributed to a weak interaction between isolated copper species, small two-dimensional copper clusters or three-dimensional clusters and the support (cupric ions are in close contact with each other) while the tailing peak at 320â€“500 Â°C is attributed to isolated Cu 2+ ions that strongly interact with the support. A shoulder peak is present at 214 Â°C for w(Cu) = 10% and it is probably due to the reduction of surface copper, which can be reduced more easily than the bulk copper oxide [25] sug- gesting that the copper species agglomerates to a certain de- gree when w(Cu) = 10%. Chary et al. [26] reported that the broadening of the peak and the shifting of the reduction peak toward high temperatures may be due to the increase in crystallinity of CuO with an increase in the copper loading. It is obvious that the low tem- perature reduction peak shifted to higher temperatures in Fig. 3 especially for w(Cu) = 15% and its reduction peak is higher than that for w(Cu) = 20%. When w(Cu) > 15%, many CuO crystallites from the agglomeration of the highly dispersed copper species emerge and large CuO crystallites, even bulk-like CuO particles, formed as the copper loading was increased. Therefore, the agglomeration of the surface copper species becomes more obvious and stronger when w(Cu) > 10%. Zhang et al. [27] found that isolated cupric ions become clustered when the copper loading was increased. Because of cupric nitrate hydrolysis, the pH of the preparation solution decreases as the copper loading increases. This may promote copper species agglomeration. 2.4 Surface chemical states of the catalysts XPS and X-ray induced Auger spectra (XAES) of the re- duced Cu/SiO 2 catalysts are shown in Figs. 4 and 5, respec- tively. The binding energy of the Cu 2p 3/2 core level rested between 934.9â€“932.6 eV and the absence of the characteristic shakeup 2pÄº3d satellite peaks suggests that the copper species is reduced (Cu 0 or/and Cu + ) [28,29]. Because the binding en- ergy values for Cu + and Cu 0 are almost identical the distinction between these two species on the catalyst surface needs a modified Auger parameter (Ä®'). The Ä®' value at ca. 1851.0 eV is 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 600 I n t e n s i t y Temperature ( o C) (7) (6) (5) (4) (3) (2) 288 266 241 225 (1) Fig. 3.

LIN Ling et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 957â€“969 due to Cu 0 and that at ca. 1849.0 eV to Cu + [28]. The decon- volution of the original Cu LMM peaks was thus carried out and the peak positions as well as their contributions were ex- tracted from the deconvolution and are listed in Table 2. These results indicate that both Cu 0 and Cu + coexist on the surface of the reduced catalyst. The smaller Ä®' value for Cu + compared with the bulk value is attributed to a strong interaction between Cu + and the support. It has been reported that when copper is in a highly dispersed state and in intimate contact with the sup- ports, Ä®' can range between 2â€“3 eV lower than the bulk values [30]. Table 2 shows that the change in the Cu + /(Cu + +Cu 0 ) intensity ratio that is derived by fitting the Cu LMM peak with an in- crease in the copper loading is in inverted volcanic form, and the maximum and minimum are w(Cu) = 5% and 20%, re- spectively. It has also been shown that the CuO species weakly interact with the support and can be readily reduced to Cu 0 at 350 Â°C [31,32]. The high Cu + /(Cu + +Cu 0 ) intensity ratio for the reduced Cu/SiO 2 catalysts signifies the retarded Cu 2+ reduction in the calcined Cu/SiO 2 samples [8]. Therefore, the high Cu + /(Cu + +Cu 0 ) intensity ratio with low copper loading suggests that the encapsulation of silica gel is very strong and the copper species is reduced to Cu 0 with difficulty while the encapsulation is less at a higher copper loading. The high Cu + /(Cu + +Cu 0 ) intensity ratio increases when w(Cu) > 20%, and it is probable that large and even sing-crystal CuO was formed and this shows that the agglomeration of the copper species increases the difficulty of copper species reduction to Cu 0 . The Cu surface area was relative to the amount of Cu on the surface, the Cu metal surface area and the Cu dispersion of the Cu/SiO 2 catalysts, as shown in Fig. 6. Changes in the Cu sur- face area with an increase in copper loading took on a volcanic shape and the Cu surface area of the w(Cu) < 15% sample was far less than that of the others suggesting that the amount of Cu on the surface increases while the encapsulation decreases. The decrease in Cu surface area is due to agglomeration when w(Cu) > 20%. Yin et al. [33] reported that a large Cu surface enhanced the activities of the catalysts. Copper species dispersion slowly decreased but when the copper loading was higher than 20%, the copper species dis- persion decreased quickly. This shows that agglomeration becomes more serious with an increase in copper loading and the agglomeration was especially serious when the copper loading was higher than 20% and this may decrease the ac- tivities of the catalysts. Therefore, the effect of copper loading on dispersion was weak to a certain degree while it could ob- viously weaken the encapsulation. 2.5 Activities of the Cu/SiO 2 catalysts for the dimethyl oxalate hydrogenation reaction The results of Cu/SiO 2 catalyst activities with different Cu content for the dimethyl oxalate hydrogenation reaction are 910 912 914 916 918 920 922 924 u 3 u 3 (7) (6) (5) (4) (3) (2) (1) Kinetic energy (eV) I n t e n s i t y 916.0 918.8 Fig. 5.

Cu metal surface area and Cu dispersion of the Cu/SiO 2 cata- lysts. LIN Ling et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 957â€“969 shown in Fig. 7. We found that DMO conversion and EG se- lectivity were all very low when w(Cu) < 15%. The activity increased sharply when the copper loading was increased to 15%. The conversion of DMO and the selectivity for EG was 99.9% and 95.0%, respectively. The space-time yield was close to 100 g/(LÂ·h). The activities of the catalysts obviously de- creased when the copper loading was higher than 25% inde- pendent of activities or stability and the 20%Cu/SiO 2 sample was optimal. Table 3 shows that the TOF values of EG were similar when the copper loading was between 15% and 25% and the TOF values were very low when the copper loading was 5% and 40%. The role of Cu 0 , Cu + , and Cu 2+ has been reported in the lit- erature but there is still no agreement on the role of the copper species toward catalytic hydrogenation [8,34â€“37]. Li et al. [36] reported that Cu + was decisive in the conversion of oxalate and that Cu 0 is responsible for the selectivity for ethylene glycol. Chen et al. [8] reported that a cooperative effect exists be- tween Cu 0 and Cu + and that this was responsible for their ac- tivities during DMO catalytic hydrogenation. Yin et al. [38] reported that better dispersion of copper spe- cies together with proper ratio of Cu 0 /Cu + made great contri- butions to the enhanced catalytic performance. Figure 8 pre- sents EG space-time yield and Cu 0 /(Cu + +Cu 0 ) ratio as a func- tion of Cu content. It showed that the changes of catalytic activities and Cu + /(Cu + +Cu 0 ) ratio with the increase of copper loadings were all volcanic form under lower H 2 /DMO and higher LHSV. This suggested that the catalytic performance was relevant to the content of Cu 0 and Cu + , that is, the coop- eration of Cu 0 and Cu + had an effect on the catalytic perform- ance. Therefore, the relatively large quantity of small CuO crys- tallites (5â€“20 nm) on the catalyst surface results from encap- sulation and agglomeration and the highest Cu surface area and the most optimal Cu 0 to Cu + ratio is responsible for the highest hydrogenation activity for the 20%CuSiO 2 sample. 3 Conclusions The encapsulation of silica and the agglomeration of Cu species can be overcome to a degree by adjusting the copper loading in catalysts prepared by the sol-gel method. This re- sults in a larger number of small CuO crystallites (about 5â€“20 nm), which are easily reduced. The difference between this and previous work is that the copper loading exceeded 10% and the catalysts prepared by the sol-gel method gave high activities when the copper loading was higher. The shortcoming is that the agglomeration becomes more serious and results in the copper species dispersion decreasing with an increase in cop- per loading. In future work, we will add additives to weaken the encapsulation and to reduce the amount of agglomeration in the higher copper loading catalysts and the Cu surface area should thus increase. The Cu 0 to Cu + ratio will also be opti- mized. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 20 40 60 80 100 (2) (3) (1) Cu loading (%) E G s e l e c t i v i t y a n d D M O c o n v e r s i o n ( % ) S p a c e - t i m e y i e l d o f E G ( g / ( L Â˜ h ) Fig. 7.

Tel: +86-591-83711523; Fax: +86-591-83714946 A series of Cu/SiO2 catalysts for the hydrogenation of dimethyl oxalate to ethylene glycol were prepared by the sol-gel method. Under optimized hydrogenation conditions, dimethyl oxalate conversion and ethylene glycol selectivity were found to reach 99.9% and 95.0%, respectively, upon varying the copper loading between 15% and 25%. The prepared catalysts were characterized by N2-physisorption, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, H2-temperature-programmed reduction, N2O titration, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results show that when the copper loading was increased under the same experimental conditions the factors that mostly affect the activities of the catalysts prepared by the sol-gel method are encapsulation and agglomeration. The encapsulation of silica is strong and it becomes the major factor when w(Cu) ≤ 10% while agglomeration among the copper species on the catalyst surface becomes more serious and is a major factor when w(Cu) > 10%. These two factors influence the surface structure, the morphology of the copper species, and the chemicals surroundings the catalysts and as a result the performance of the catalysts is affected too.

        "dc:description": "A series of Cu/SiO2 catalysts for the hydrogenation of dimethyl oxalate to ethylene glycol were prepared by the sol-gel method. Under optimized hydrogenation conditions, dimethyl oxalate conversion and ethylene glycol selectivity were found to reach 99.9% and 95.0%, respectively, upon varying the copper loading between 15% and 25%. The prepared catalysts were characterized by N2-physisorption, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, H2-temperature-programmed reduction, N2O titration, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results show that when the copper loading was increased under the same experimental conditions the factors that mostly affect the activities of the catalysts prepared by the sol-gel method are encapsulation and agglomeration. The encapsulation of silica is strong and it becomes the major factor when w(Cu) ≤ 10% while agglomeration among the copper species on the catalyst surface becomes more serious and is a major factor when w(Cu) > 10%. These two factors influence the surface structure, the morphology of the copper species, and the chemicals surroundings the catalysts and as a result the performance of the catalysts is affected too.",
