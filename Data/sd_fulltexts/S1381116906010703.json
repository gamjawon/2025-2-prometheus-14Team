Keywords Carbon dioxide Epoxides Organic base Stannic chloride Coupling reaction 1 Introduction Recently, the carbon dioxide fixation has received much attention by reason of carbon dioxide is the most inexpensive and renewable carbon resource from the viewpoint of green chemistry and atom economy [1–5]. The cyclic carbonates are valuable products that are widely used as organic synthetic intermediates, aprotic polar solvents, and raw materials for plastics [6–16]. Various catalyst systems have been developed for the cyclocarbonate synthesis (Eq. (1)) via the coupling reaction of carbon dioxide and epoxides including metal salts, metal oxides, organometallic compounds, ionic liquid, transition-metal and main group complexes [17–30]. Most of these catalysts initiated the coupling reaction under harsh condition. (1) We have previously reported an efficient catalyst system, SalenSn/DMAP, for coupling reaction of CO2 and epoxides, that the SalenSn complex and DMAP are not catalysts alone [31]. The primitive blank experiment of coupling reaction of CO2 and propylene oxide (PO) was failed due to the insolubility of SnCl4-2DMAP precipitates. Surprisingly, when the DMAP was firstly dissolved into PO and then SnCl4 was added to the solution to make a clearly or little slurry solution, the expected coupling reaction was carried out under very mild condition. We were pleased to discover that the neutral Lewis acid–Lewis base complexes of SnCl4-organic base are excellent catalysts for coupling reaction of carbon dioxide and epoxides. Herein, we disclose our results for the optimization and application of these simple catalysts to various cyclic carbonate syntheses. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials The epoxides were purified and dried with CaH2. Stannic chloride and other chemicals were purchased from Aldrich and used without further purification. 2.2 General procedure of catalytic coupling reaction All coupling reactions were performed in a 250mL glass autoclave, shown clearly the solubility of catalyst, equipped with a magnetic stir bar. The chemicals, dried solvent and autoclave were taken into dry-box. The autoclave was charged successively with the epoxide, organic base, and diluting SnCl4 (in CH2Cl2). After taking out the closed autoclave from dry-box, it was pressurized with CO2 to 100psi through connecting to the CO2 pressure vessel and then was heated and stirred. When the pressure of CO2 fell down to 0–15psi, the reactor was cooled and was then vented. The remaining mixture was distilled under reduced pressure or recrystallized with ethanol to obtain the pure cyclic carbonate. 2.3 In situ 119Sn NMR investigations The investigated samples were prepared by adding SnCl4 to CH2Cl2 in a vial under N2 and cooled down in dry ice. It was transferred slowly to another vial containing DBU and PO in toluene (also cooled in dry ice). When the mixture was warmed up to room temperature, it was transferred to an NMR tube to collect the 119Sn NMR data at 75°C by using Sn(CH3)4 as an external standard without lock. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Anion effect of catalysts in the coupling reaction of propylene oxide and CO2 Firstly, different stannic halogenides were used as Lewis acid to form these complex catalysts with two equivalent DMAP (Table 1 ). The catalytic results demonstrated that SnCl4-2DMAP catalyst has the highest activity comparing with other catalysts. SnF4-2DMAP has no activity due to its insolubility. 3.2 Base effect of catalysts in the coupling reaction of propylene oxide and CO2 Several other organic bases were investigated as possible Lewis base for SnCl4-organic base catalysts (Table 2 ). SnCl4-DMAP has superior activity in comparison to other organic bases, which might be attributed to its high Lewis basicity. SnCl4-DABCO has no activity at all due to its insolubility. The quantity of organic base was found to be quite important. While the presence of organic base is critical for high activity and the TOF increased upon going from 2 to 5 equivalent of organic base (for DBN, the number is from 2 to 4), further addition of organic base results in a decrease of the TOF. Finally, extension of these ideas to the different high valency metal chlorides such as the ZrCl4-2DBU and SbCl5-2DBU catalyst systems was also investigated in the coupling reaction of PO and carbon dioxide. ZrCl4-2DBU has activity with 102 of TOF value and SbCl5-2DBU shown no activity due to its insolubility. It is worth to mention that the cheap and easy to handle stannic chloride hydrate of SnCl4·5H2O was also used to make precipitate with five equivalent DBU that can also catalyze efficiently the coupling reaction of PO and carbon dioxide with a little impurity. 3.3 The cyclic carbonates syntheses from CO2 with various epoxides The SnCl4-5DBU was used as catalyst in the coupling reaction of CO2 and various epoxides at 75°C generating the relevant cyclic carbonates with good to excellent yield (Table 3 ). This coupling reaction can also take place under more mild condition (50°C) except for the hexene oxide in which the catalyst is insoluble (entry 3). This simple and effective catalyst, SnCl4-5DBU, can also be utilized in the coupling reaction of CO2 and cyclohexene oxide (CHO) to conveniently obtain the cyclohexene carbonate under mild condition with high stereoselectivity (94% cis-hexahydro-1,3-benzodioxol-2-one, entry 7) [32]. 3.4 Proposed mechanism of coupling reaction The above results might be explained by considering a similar mechanism for this coupling reaction when using an Cr(III)porphyrin/DMAP catalyst system. In this mechanism (Scheme 1 ), the epoxides replace the coordinated organic bases to dissolve the precipitate of SnCl4-2Base complexes and be activated by a Lewis acidic metal center, and then be attacked by nucleophilic reagent to produce the requisite metal alkoxide intermediates suffering insertion of CO2 to lead cyclic carbonates. The in situ 119Sn NMR spectra show that there are two peaks for SnCl4-4PO (Sn(PO)Cl4, −551.8ppm; Sn(PO)2Cl4, −555.0ppm) and six peaks for SnCl4-4PO-2DBU (Sn(PO)Cl4, −599.5ppm; Sn(PO)2Cl4, −605.2ppm; Sn(PO)(DBU)Cl4, −607.5ppm; Sn(PO)(POCl)Cl4, −630.7ppm; Sn(POCl)(DBU)Cl4, −634.9ppm; Sn(DBU)2Cl4, −663.6ppm) demonstrating different species of the precipitate (insoluble, Sn(DBU)2Cl4) and the soluble coordinated complexes in the mixture solution comparing one peak for SnCl4 (−155.9ppm). 4 Conclusion In summary, we developed a series of novel and high efficient catalysts, SnCl4-organic bases. Among them, SnCl4-5DBU is one of the best catalysts for the coupling reaction of carbon dioxide and various epoxides yielding relevant cyclic carbonates by which carbon dioxide can be easily introduced into organic molecules under very mild condition.
