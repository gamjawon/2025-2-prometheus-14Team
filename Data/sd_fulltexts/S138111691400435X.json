Graphical abstract A theoretical interpretation of the mechanism of ethylene glycol oxidation to glyoxal over Ag-containing catalysts is considered. A model system, reflecting the interaction of Ag cluster with process adsorbates and/or intermediates, is proposed. Both partial oxidation of ethylene glycol to glyoxal and CO2 formation routes are reconstructed, and the corresponding reaction profiles are represented. The roles played by the most important reaction intermediates participating in the process under consideration are discussed. Keywords Silver Cluster model Ethylene glycol Oxidation DFT 1 Introduction Partial oxidation of alcohols to produce valuable organic compounds has always been of interest to experimental and theoretical science. Among these thoroughly investigated processes are ethylene and propylene epoxidation [1,2], methanol oxidation to formaldehyde [3], etc. It is widely known that silver is one of the most active catalysts for the partial oxidation processes. Recently, various silver-catalyzed processes have been described using density functional theory (DFT) based approaches [4–8]. The main aspects investigated were mechanisms of catalytic action, gas-phase adsorption of compounds as well as their interactions within the system [9–12]. It is noteworthy that the calculation methods based on DFT approaches usually provide a unique opportunity to investigate the material surfaces on atomic level with good accuracy [13–17]. This allows investigating both experimentally found stable species as well as highly reactive surface intermediates and transition states determining the reaction kinetics [18–20]. To investigate the abovementioned peculiarities of oxidation processes it is convenient to use small cluster models, which proved their usefulness in adsorption studies and allowed the researchers to describe correctly the structures, vibrational spectra and properties of the adsorbates as well as energies of physical and chemical adsorption [21–23]. Recently, more attention has been given to the process of ethylene glycol oxidation into glyoxal over IB metal catalysts [24,25]. Novel supported silver catalysts (5wt.% of Ag) with active component particle size distribution from 5 to 50nm were developed [26]. The active component of the catalyst mentioned is immobilized in silicate-phosphate matrix [27] and organized as various neutral and charged silver clusters (Ag4, Ag4 2+, Ag2 +, Ag6, Ag8 2+, etc.) over the support surface [28]. Using XPS and TPD methods it was shown that small silver clusters participate in ethylene glycol oxidation into glyoxal. Despite wide experimental investigations there were no attempts to look at the process of ethylene glycol oxidation from the quantum-chemical point of view. Theoretical approaches were used mainly for systems describing the silver-oxygen interaction solely [29–33] or in a combination with experimental studies [34–45]. Several works were devoted to simulations of structural and energy parameters of gas-phase molecules and adsorbed intermediates for individual components participating in the process under consideration. Structural and energy parameters were determined for glyoxal [16,46–48], ethylene glycol [49–51], formaldehyde [52,53], molecular oxygen [29,54,30,55], carbon dioxide [52], hydrogen [56,57] using various functionals and basis sets. More efforts were given to simulations of interactions of silver surface with reaction intermediates. The interactions of H2O, O, H and OH species with silver were studied in [32]. The interactions of ethylenedioxy species, which is believed to be one of the most important reaction intermediates in several partial oxidation processes, was studied in [41]. Formate and carbonate species interactions studies were carried out in [58–60]. It is noteworthy that all the calculations mentioned were carried out using different approaches, functionals, and basis sets. This complicates the comparison and application of the results obtained. For the key components of the process (ethylene glycol, glyoxal, etc.) such studies were not carried out yet. Thus, the aim of the present work was to undertake systematic theoretical study of the main structural parameters and interaction energies of the most important reaction intermediates and adsorbates in the process of ethylene glycol oxidation into glyoxal as well as to construct energy profiles of the major reaction routes. 2 Computational details In the present paper the systems containing neutral Ag4 cluster and/or adsorbates/intermediates were calculated at B3LYP/DGDZVP level of theory. The calculations were carried out using the Gaussian’09 program package installed at SKIF “Cyberia” supercomputer of Tomsk State University [61,62]. Initial silver state was represented by four-atom cluster with planar geometry. The distance between two adjacent silver atoms in the initial structure was 4.086Å [63]. Calculations of the tetrahedron-like initial state of silver cluster were carried out for comparison. The role and nature of support was not taken into consideration in the present work. Gas-phase molecule and/or process intermediates were placed no less than 1.4Å above the cluster surface in atop (A), bridge (B), “hollow, above” (C), and “hollow, in-plane” (D) adsorption sites (Fig. 1 ). The energy of gas-phase molecule/intermediate adsorption over the cluster was determined as a difference between total energy of the adsorbate(intermediate)/surface system and a sum of isolated adsorbate(intermediate) and silver cluster energies. Geometry of all the obtained structures was fully optimized. In all cases the nature of stationary point was checked by vibrational frequency calculations. The majority of the optimized structures was in global energy minimum and had real frequencies only. The absence of imaginary vibrational frequencies confirmed the stationary character of structures. When the structure had imaginary frequencies, IRC calculations were carried out to determine the transition state. The thermodynamic parameters of the molecules calculated were corrected for zero-point vibrational energy (ZPVE) and reduced to normal conditions (298.15K, 1atm) using thermal corrections to enthalpy and free energy. Thermodynamic parameters were also calculated under real process conditions (830K, 1atm) [64] corresponding to the maximal selectivity towards glyoxal observed in real process conditions. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Tentative mechanism of ethylene glycol partial oxidation over silver-containing catalysts In our previous works [24,65] it was shown that the process of ethylene glycol oxidation into glyoxal over silver-containing catalysts (i.e., bulk, supported or nanostructured materials) proceeds through three main temperature modes, namely, kinetic, transient and external diffusion ones. The main products in each temperature zone are glyoxal, glycolaldehyde, formaldehyde, carbon oxides, hydrogen, and several carbon acids (glycolic acid, glyoxalic acid, etc.). Glyoxal is the predominant product at elevated temperatures, and different amounts of carbon oxides and hydrogen are formed depending on the type of catalyst used. The product distribution clearly shows that both oxidative dehydrogenation and total oxidation routes, resulting in formation of glyoxal and carbon dioxide, respectively, take place over silver-containing catalysts. This situation is observed for all above-mentioned types of silver catalysts pointing out that there are active sites with similar nature. It is noteworthy that the process of catalytic oxidation of ethylene glycol into glyoxal differs from the reactions of monoalcohol oxidation and is complicated by a number of transformations which do not take place in cases of oxidation of methanol, ethanol and other alcohols (e.g., ethylene glycol oxidation to acetaldehyde or glycolaldehyde, glycolaldehyde oxidation to glyoxal, etc.) [24]. The transformations mentioned usually occur due to high reactivity of both ethylene glycol molecule and the products of its oxidation. There are only sparse literature data concerning the detailed mechanism of ethylene glycol oxidation into glyoxal over active sites of silver-containing catalysts. Due to hard process conditions there were almost no attempts to carry out the in situ studies under real process conditions. Madix and Capote [66,67] carried out the in situ studies of the process mechanism using EELS and TPR techniques. In [67] the adsorption and reaction of ethylene glycol over clean and oxygen-covered Ag (110) surface were investigated. It was shown that ethylene glycol participates in reversible adsorption over clean silver surface from monolayer state, and is tied to the Ag (110) by both oxygen atoms in monolayer state. It was demonstrated also that ethylene glycol interacts with atomic oxygen over partially oxidized surface to form adsorbed ethylenedioxy species (Z2(CH2O)2) which is stable to up to 350K, where cleavage and transformation of C-H bond resulting in elimination of ethylene glycol, glyoxal and hydrogen takes place. It was stated that decomposition of Z2(CH2O)2 proceeds through formation of surface bound species. In [58] an influence of coadsorbed oxygen atoms on the decomposition of 1,2-ethylenedioxy surface species was studied over Ag (110). It was shown that surface oxygen atoms react with 1,2-ethylenedioxy species to give water and formaldehyde as well as adsorbed formate. Then the later species decomposes to form CO2 and H2. The isotope technique was used to show that oxygen atom is transferred to formaldehyde from 1,2-ethylenedioxy species, while the adsorbed formate accepts one oxygen atom from ethylenedioxy species and the other one from coadsorbed oxygen. Hydrogen atom cleavage from methylene carbon in Z(OCHCH2O) and surface formate decomposition with formation of CO2 also take place. On the basis of the abovementioned data the following reaction set can be proposed (Table 1 ). Here Z is the active site participating in adsorption of gas phase molecules or intermediates. Z2 corresponds to two-side adsorption of the species. EG, GO, FD correspond to gas phase ethylene glycol, glyoxal and formaldehyde molecule, respectively, ZO and ZO2 correspond to adsorbed atomic and molecular oxygen species, Z2EG is adsorbed ethylene glycol, ZEDO is adsorbed ethylenedioxy species, ZOEO is adsorbed 2-oxoethoxy species, ZFA is adsorbed formate species, ZH and ZH2 are adsorbed atomic and molecular hydrogen species, ZCO3 is adsorbed carbonate species, ZH2O is adsorbed water. This set of reactions will be adequate to describe the experimentally observed regularities of the process under consideration and carry out the quantum chemical calculations. The probable route connected with transformation of ethylene glycol to glycolaldehyde was not taken into consideration to simplify the model and due to the fact that the impact of this route in case of bulk silver catalysts is negligible. Thus, taking into account the data on product distribution, the propositions on the process mechanism as well as the data on physical and chemical interaction of silver with the process components it is possible to suggest that the following key components can be taken for the quantum-chemical calculations of the process: • gas phase molecules: ethylene glycol, oxygen, glyoxal, carbon dioxide, water, formaldehyde, hydrogen, • intermediates: atomic hydrogen, atomic oxygen, ethylenedioxy, 2-oxoethoxy, formate. 3.2 Calculation results obtained at B3LYP/DGDZVP level of theory Ag 4 cluster. The optimized cluster represents a planar rhomboidal structure. At the B3LYP/DGDZVP the bond length between two adjacent silver atoms was 2.91Å with rhomb angles of 124.1° and 55.9°. The calculation results obtained correlated well with known experimental and theoretical results (for instance, 2.889Å in [58], 2.838Å in [22], 2.66Å in [68]). Gas phase molecules. B3LYP/DGDZVP level of theory was used to optimize the geometry parameters of gas phase molecules forming and participating in the process under consideration. The received bond lengths and angles correspond to those experimental or calculated results reported for glyoxal in [69], ethylene glycol in [70], singlet and triplet oxygen in [71], molecular hydrogen in [72], carbon oxides [32], formaldehyde [15 and references therein], and water [73], respectively. The calculation error was less than 0.1% for all the molecules mentioned. Thus, one can see that the used level of theory provides adequate correlation between calculated and experimental results for the majority of cases. This can be explained by the fact that full-electron valence-split basis set with additional polarization functions (DGDZVP) was specially optimized for DFT calculations, including those made using B3LYP hybrid functional. Moreover, the vibrational spectra of all the gas-phase molecules calculated at B3LYP/DGDZVP level of theory correlate well with known experimental data. For the majority of cases the positions of calculated peaks agreed with known literature data within 25–70cm–1. It is noteworthy that for those systems containing both silver cluster and gas-phase adsorbate/intermediate only EELS spectra were available from the literature, implicating that only peak positions can be compared, but not the peak intensities. Thus, the method can be used for correct description of the interactions within silver-containing geometries with adequate accuracy, which was also shown by several research groups [9,74–78]. It is noteworthy that when initial cluster structure was equal to tetrahedron, the optimized structure turned into planar rhomboidal shape with the same geometry parameters as for initial planar structure for both used levels of theory. 3.3 Energy profile of the ethylene glycol partial oxidation process at the B3LYP/DGDZVP level of theory The process mechanism, taken for the calculations, was formulated on the basis of experimental results obtained in [24,66,67]. A good correlation between the present calculation results and known experimentally determined structural and vibrational parameters of gas phase molecules and adsorbed reaction intermediates was achieved. In Fig. 2 one can see the resulting energy profile containing the key component interactions in the process of EG oxidation over silver-containing catalysts. The following mechanism was assumed. The activation of gas-phase oxygen over silver cluster is the first stage of the process. Both triplet and singlet states of oxygen molecule were considered. The results of energy calculations show that triplet-oxygen-containing systems possess lower total energies compared to those containing singlet oxygen. The calculated and optimized geometry parameters and interaction energies show that weak interactions are typical for such systems. This correlate with the results by [80] showing that the error in determination of activation energy using DFT methods may amount to 3–5kcal/mol. According to the calculation results, the most energetically favorable place for singlet molecular oxygen activation is the hollow site of the cluster. The distance between two oxygen atoms in the ZO2 geometry is 1.433Å, which proves the activated state of singlet oxygen molecule over the Ag4 cluster (OO bond length in isolated molecule was 1.21Å). It is noteworthy that the reconstruction of the cluster occurs during the activation of oxygen molecule. Similar situation is believed to take place on the real Ag catalyst surface under oxygen-lean conditions. The resulting cluster geometry is close to tetrahedral one and corresponds to C1 type of framework group. The next important stage is splitting of the molecular oxygen into two separate atoms. The process can be realized due to probable surface diffusion of one of oxygen atoms towards clean silver surface areas caused by high affinity of silver for oxygen. Another possible mechanism can be connected with significant surface restructuring which usually takes place during the formation of oxygen state (which is active in partial oxidation of alcohols [43]), interaction of oxidized silver surface with water, etc. The atoms form stable 2.05-Å Ag–O bonds and are adsorbed on atop and bridge site positions providing the opportunities for various process routes. The resulting system belongs to C1 type of framework group. Then the reconstruction of Ag cluster takes place resulting in formation of boat-like geometry containing two types of active sites represented by Ag-adsorbed oxygen atoms in atop/bridge and hollow site positions. According to the results obtained, oxygen atoms in atop/bridge sites participate in partial oxidation reactions, while hollow sites are active in total oxidation processes. Different energetics causes the opportunity for these species to display different activity in subsequent activation and transformation of ethylene glycol and other species. It is noteworthy, however, that the energy levels of atop and bridge sites, obtained during the calculation, are equal. This hinders the opportunity to tell one from the other and complicates the understanding of the role played by each species. Thus, for the subsequent interpretation of the DFT results we denote the species active in partial oxidation process as the bridge one. Participation of oxygen atoms in different processes correlates with the experimental data on the existence of several atomic oxygen species (i.e., Oα, Oβ, Oγ) and their roles in the oxidation processes over silver-containing catalysts [3]. Taking into account the literature data on the mechanism of methanol transformation to formaldehyde [3,82], it is possible to conclude that within the proposed model the oxygen atom in bridge position may correspond to Oγ species, which is believed to be responsible for partial oxidation processes at high temperatures. Atomic oxygen in atop position may participate in deep oxidation processes, and may be considered as Oα species. Hence, the atomic oxygen in hollow position may play the role of donor for the above mentioned oxygen species, and can be denoted as Oβ. However, different type of model (e.g., periodic slab model) is required to make more precise designations. Activation of ethylene glycol is the next important process. According to the computational results, only slight activation of ethylene glycol is observed under oxygen-lean conditions. The O–H and C–C bond lengths are equal to those in isolated gas phase ethylene glycol molecule (i.e., 0.971 and 1.512Å, respectively). The slight deviation is observed when ethylene glycol is located in atop site position: slight stretching of both O–H and C–C bonds (0.977 and 1.528Å, respectively) takes place. However, such effects seem inadequate to activate ethylene glycol towards any particular processes. The interaction of ethylene glycol with oxygen-less system is quite weak. It is noteworthy that in the most energetically favorable system (see Fig. 2) ethylene glycol is coordinated via both oxygen atoms with respect to different atoms of the cluster, which does not agree with the proposition on bidentate or chelating correlation of monolayered ethylene glycol species made by [66]. The experimental value of interaction energy determined in [81] was 48.9–58.3±0.8kJ/mol, which is close to the one received in the present work (42.5kJ/mol). When oxygen atom is present in the cluster model, the situation is changed. In the majority of the calculated geometries, containing silver cluster, oxygen atom and ethylene glycol molecule in various positions, the geometry parameters of ethylene glycol remained unchanged in comparison with those in gas phase molecule. However, in the most energetically favorable structure, where oxygen atom was placed in bridge position and ethylene glycol molecule was located in “hollow, above” site position, the distance between O and H atoms in the OH-group, adjacent to the cluster, reached 1.006Å, indicating that surface oxygen plays crucial role in activation of ethylene glycol molecule during the process. Ag–O distance within the cluster was the largest one (2.089Å) in case of the system mentioned, while in other systems comprising cluster, oxygen atom and ethylene glycol it was slightly shorter (2.054–2.064Å). It is noteworthy that, when oxygen atom is present in the initial cluster geometry, the coordination of ethylene glycol proceeds via both oxygen atoms (see Fig. 1), reflecting the two-side adsorption. A step-by-step activation of OH-groups takes place resulting in scission of OH bonds and formation of ethylenedioxy oxametallacycle, which correlates with the propositions made in [66]. Ethylenedioxy species is believed to be the most important reaction intermediate in ethylene glycol partial oxidation, since it participates in all transformations resulting in the majority of the reaction products. Geometry parameters of the optimized structures of key reaction intermediates are represented in Table 2 . The calculated vibrational spectra coincide with experimental results [66], if scaling factor of 0.965 is used. According to the results obtained, under oxygen-lean conditions ethylenedioxy species interacts with silver cluster via both oxygen atoms located in two bridge positions. This stage is considered as a rate-limiting step of the process. Similar situation is observed in case of the system, which models oxygen-covered surface. The interaction energy is higher in case of oxygen-containing system, which is caused by well-known affinity of silver for oxygen. Among all possible geometries two are of particular importance. The first one represents a structure where both oxygen atom and ethylenedioxy species are located in bridge position. The resulting geometry reflects the process of C–C bond cleavage and formation of two adsorbed activated formaldehyde molecules. One of the activated molecules is adsorbed via CO oxygen atom and one of hydrogen atoms interacting with silver and surface oxygen atom, respectively. The deep oxidation products are not formed, proving that oxygen in bridge site position participates in partial oxidation processes. The second geometry consists of silver cluster, ethylenedioxy and atomic oxygen species adsorbed in atop positions. According to the results obtained, C–H bond activation takes place followed by transfer of H atom to atomic oxygen in atop position resulting in formation of surface adsorbed OH and 2-oxoethoxy species. 2-Oxoethoxy species is considered as another important reaction intermediate. According to the known propositions on the process mechanism, the decomposition of the ethylenedioxy species results in glyoxal evolving. The geometrical parameters of the optimized adsorbed structure are represented in Table 2. The peak positions in the calculated vibrational spectra correlate with known experimental results [66], if scaling factor of 0.965 is used. When 2-oxoethoxy species interacts with oxygen-containing cluster, the interaction energy rises. Slight increase in C–C bond length is observed (up to 1.530Å), while the distance between oxygen atom and closest silver atom reduces to up to 2.102Å. Obviously, the majority of geometry parameters of the species are close to those of glyoxal molecule (i.e., r (C–C)=1.528Å, r (CO)=1.214Å, r (C–H)=1.108Å) providing favorable energy costs to form the desired product. The species reacts with surface oxygen to yield formate species which is believed to be a source of carbon dioxide and formaldehyde. The formate species is characterized by geometry parameters represented in Table 2. The Ag–O distance is 2.260Å. The geometry of the species remains stable in case of oxygen-containing systems. However, the interaction energy rises in 2.75 times compared to the one under oxygen-lean conditions. Probably, formate species participates in two processes: its direct decomposition results in formation of adsorbed CO2 and H species, while its interaction with surface oxygen may lead to formation of adsorbed CO2 and OH species. The formed adsorbed CO2 species may also interact with surface oxygen to yield carbonate species over silver. In [82] it was shown that direct decomposition of formate species over free active site is a rate-limiting step of the methanol oxidation to formaldehyde along with the decomposition of methoxy species. In [32] it was shown that the energies of water adsorption over silver surface in atop and bridge sites are 46.4 and 50.2kJ/mol, respectively, which correlates well with the results of the present work. It is necessary to point out that the formed atomic hydrogen species may play an important role in the process under consideration. In [83] an effect of gas additives was studied in the process of ethylene glycol oxidation to glyoxal. During the experiment molecular hydrogen was introduced into reaction mixture partially replacing the nitrogen. It was shown that interaction of active sites of the surface of real silver-containing catalysts with hydrogen leads to reduction in the amount of hydrogen emitted during the process. This proves that reversible reaction 2ZH↔H2(g) +2Z is indeed takes place over the catalyst surface, and molecular hydrogen is the product required to maintain the adiabatic mode of ethylene glycol oxidation process. Several transition states were found. Among them are geometries reflecting the interaction of silver cluster containing oxygen atom in hollow site position with ethylenedioxy and 2-oxoethoxy species as well as molecular hydrogen (all species adsorbed in atop site position). One more transition state comprises atomic oxygen in bridge site position and ethylene glycol molecule adsorbed in hollow position. The transition geometries mentioned readily participate in key stages of ethylene glycol oxidation. The cluster model used does not allow describing all the aspects of surface processes, inhomogeneity of real catalyst surface, interlayer atomic interactions, relaxation of subsurface layers, etc. The modeling of the mentioned peculiarities via development of correct surface model will be a subject of separate work and is beyond the aims of the present article. The used cluster model imitates the catalyst surface location (e.g., active site formed by silver atom cluster) and is suitable to demonstrate the opportunities to obtain correct and having physical sense values of interaction energies and geometry parameters for the interaction of the main process components with silver catalyst. 3.4 Thermochemistry. The results obtained using B3LYP/DGDZVP level of theory were used in thermochemical calculations (Table 3 ). The calculated heat effects had adequate values and correlated with the known experimental results. However, in case of molecular hydrogen the values were lower, which was caused by the structure of the DGDZVP basis set. For those reactions also represented in [82,84] (namely, reactions 3, 9) a good correlation between the results obtained was achieved despite application of different levels of theory. The calculated results for reactions 1, 4–8 correlate well with the data of [82] in terms of close values obtained for similar stages. The results for molecular oxygen were slightly higher and closer to the dissociative adsorption heat effects. Stages 5, 6, 8, where atomic or molecular hydrogen is released, are endothermic, while those stages dealing with adsorption of initial gas-phase substances or oxidation stages, where atomic oxygen is involved, are exothermic. Good correlation with [66,67] was achieved with respect to heat effect of reactions 5 and 6 (51 and 73.1±3.8kJ/mol for ethylenedioxy species and 108.6 and 87.8±3.8kJ/mol for 2-oxoethoxy species, respectively). In case of reaction 10 the heat effects determined in the present work do not correspond to the known experimental and calculated data, since the dehydrogenation processes are endothermic on their nature. However, in [52] it was shown that this regularity may not be fulfilled in case of surface reactions, and heat effect may possess a negative value. The reason for the inconsistency can be also connected with the structure of the used basis set, which is specially optimized for DFT calculations of heavy atoms. Being a light element, hydrogen is treated by calculation of 5S functions, which results in reduction of the values of bond energy in molecular hydrogen. Nevertheless, the thermochemical results obtained quantitatively reflect the transformations assumed to take place over the Ag-containing catalysts of ethylene glycol oxidation to glyoxal. Obviously, the catalyst support used can influence on the resulting geometrical, energetic and vibrational parameters. The composition of the supporting matrix of the catalyst under consideration will definitely impact on step-by-step activation of O–H and C–H bonds both in terms of energetics and geometry. For instance, one can expect an increase in interaction energies within the systems reflecting the interaction of process components with silver cluster adsorbed on the model support structure due to H-bonding. These processes may also result in additional C–O bond elongation and occurrence of shifts in calculated vibrational spectra. However, complex composition and structure of supporting matrix requires additional research to reveal the impact of the factors mentioned. Nevertheless, the cluster model used is adequate enough to describe the interactions with ethylene glycol oxidation components, since the received values of interaction energies, geometry and vibrational parameters have physical sense and correlate with known experimental and calculated results. 4 Conclusions A detailed investigation of the mechanism of ethylene glycol oxidation over Ag4 silver cluster has been carried out at B3LYP/DGDZVP level of theory. The results obtained for all the species involved within common approach and methods will be useful in further detailed elaboration of the process mechanism. It was shown that DFT method provide good correlation between experimental and theoretical data at relatively low time and computer costs. The reaction profile reflecting the processes of ethylene glycol partial oxidation to glyoxal and its deep oxidation to carbon dioxide were generated. It was shown that bridge site is preferable for atomic oxygen adsorption, and participates in ethylene glycol activation, while hollow site is involved in deep oxidation processes. This correlates well with known assumptions on different forms of oxygen on the surface of Ag-containing catalysts and their roles in the oxidation processes over silver-containing catalysts. Most important reaction intermediates were also revealed. Thus, ethylenedioxy and 2-oxyethoxy species were found to be the basic reaction intermediates transforming into major reaction products.

        "dc:description": "A theoretical interpretation of the mechanism of ethylene glycol oxidation to glyoxal over Ag-containing catalysts is considered. A model system, reflecting the interaction of Ag cluster with process adsorbates and/or intermediates, is proposed. Both partial oxidation of ethylene glycol to glyoxal and CO2 formation routes are reconstructed, and the corresponding reaction profiles are represented. The roles played by the most important reaction intermediates participating in the process under consideration are discussed.",
