No. 458, (Associe d I'Ecole Nationale Superieure de Chimie de Lille) Universite des Sciences et Techniques de Lille, 59655 Villeneuve d'Ascq Cedex (France) Summary Bimetallic Pt Mo catalysts deposited on silica, with an equal number of metal atoms per gram of catalyst, have been prepared by co impregnation of the support, then reduction at 500 C under flowing hydrogen. XPS analysis indicates that the ratio J(Pt4f)/Z(Si2p) is proportional to the ratio Pt/Si of the number of platinum to silicon atoms, and that molybdenum is only partially reduced to Mo , the ratio Mo^Mo^ai being roughly the same for all catalysts. The binding energy of 4d7/2Pt electrons is the same what- ever the catalyst composition, indicating that if any electronic modification of Pt occurs it is very slight. Hydrogen chemisorption (HC) indicates that the ratio H/Pt decreases when the molybdenum proportion increases. Oxygen uptakes at 300 C were measured, and the degrees of oxidation of molyb- denum have been estimated using two different sets of hypotheses. These results have been discussed and compared to XPS results. The catalysts were then characterized by their activity in three organic test reactions. The rate of cyclohexane dehydrogenation at 270 C is proportional to the amount of platinum present, but rates of butane hydrogenolysis at 300 C and of benzene hydrogenation at 50 C indicate the occurence of synergy effects which are stronger for butane hydrogenolysis. These results are discussed, and can be accounted for if the ratio Ptg/Pt is constant throughout the series of catalysts. The rate-determining step of the cyclohexane dehydrogenation takes place only on surface platinum atoms. However butane hydrogenolysis and benzene hydrogenation probably occur on Pt Mo at rates higher than on platinum. Mixed sites of the same composition are thought to operate on all the catalysts. Such active sites include at least one hydrogen adsorption site. *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/84/$3.00 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 68 Introduction The importance of bimetallic catalysts, such as Pt Sn and Pt Pb on the one hand and Pt Ir and particularly Pt Re on the other hand, in the catalytic reforming industry has been increasing during recent decades [1-5]. These catalysts exhibit important advantages compared to classical reforming catalysts, since they have better activities and selectivities and, above all, better stability. However, for the catalysts of the second category, because of their industrial interest the prices of additives to Pt (Ir and partic- ularly Re) have increased significantly, and moreover the reserves of these metals are limited. Considering these conditions, it seems interesting to try to substitute these expensive metals in part by other additives which are more abundant and cheaper, such as molybdenum and tungsten, and which could modify the properties of platinum in a manner similar to iridium or rhenium. Indeed, although the solubility of platinum in molybdenum is very low, molybdenum is widely soluble in platinum and leads to solid solutions with platinum, having a face-centered cubic system up to 46% molybdenum, and a hexagonal close-packed phase at levels between 46 and 72% molybdenum [16]. Molybdenum is thus soluble in platinum at least up to 72% Mo; more- over, the solubility of molybdenum can be increased for small particles com- pared to bulk samples [17]. In this case, the addition of molybdenum is likely to modify the properties of platinum since both metals can cocrys- tallize [18]. An extensive study of bimetallic platinum-rhenium catalysts [6 -10] has pointed out some remarkable features: the occurrence of interactions between platinum and rhenium which indicate that atoms of platinum and of rhenium are in the same metal particle; phenomena of synergy, particularly for hydrogenation and hydro- genolysis reactions; a clear catalytic effect of platinum in the reduction of rhenium oxide. The bimetallic association of platinum-molybdenum has already been studied by Yermakov et al. [11] in ethane hydrogenolysis and Tri et al. [12, 13] in butane hydrogenolysis. These authors have both clearly shown that bimetallic Pt + Mo catalysts have higher activities than platinum or molyb- denum alone, the latter being nearly inactive. The catalysts were prepared in two different ways. Yermakov et al. have successively exhanged the OH groups of a silica gel with allyl complexes of molybdenum and then of platinum. Tri et al. first exchanged the cations of Y zeolite with platinum and then reduced the catalyst and added molybdenum by sublimating hexa- carbonyl molybdenum which then decomposed under hydrogen at 300 C. Thus, in both cases the two constituents were successively introduced: either first Mo then Pt, or first Pt then Mo. 69 In this study, we decided to prepare our catalysts by the classical coim- pregnation method in order to check whether the method of preparing Pt Mo catalysts has an influence on their properties. Silica was preferred to alumina as a support since it exhibits less interaction with molybdenum [14,15]. In the first part of this work we have attempted to characterize the sur- faces of the catalysts using XPS and chemisorption studies of hydrogen and of oxygen. The solids were then tested in three organic reactions modeling reforming reactions: dehydrogenation of cyclohexane at 270 C; hydrogenation of benzene at 50 C; reactions of butane with hydrogen at 300 C. Experimental Catalytic activities Hydrogenolysis of butane and dehydrogenation of cyclohexane were carried out in a flow reactor at atmospheric pressure as described in refs. 19 and 20. As the hydrogenation of benzene is fast, in order to eliminate all diffusion limitations, it was carried out in a batch recirculation system [21] modified according to ref. 22. Procedures have already been described elsewhere [19, 20, 23]. Adsorption experiments The adsorption apparatus was a conventional gas volumetric system [24] equipped with a Texas Instrument precision pressure gauge [23]. The samples were reduced in situ at 500 C in order to avoid any con- tamination by oxygen during transfer. They were subsequently outgassed at 500 C for about 12 h. XPS The X-ray photoelectron spectra were taken with an AEI ES 200 B spectrometer equipped with an Al anode (hv = 1486.6 eV, 300 W). The use of a dry N2-purged glove box attached between the spectrometer and a reactor in which H; reductions were performed allowed examination of the reduced samples without contact with air. The prereduced catalysts were set on a metallic grid, where the subsequent reduction was carried out at 500 C for 1 h, or pressed on an indium foil for treatments at room temperature. The sample probe was inserted into the reactor for the H2 treatment, trans- ferred through the glove box and then inserted into the spectrometer. Mo3d3/2-s/2 and Pt4f5/2.7/2 doublets were always accumulated (4 h each) to improve the signal-to-noise ratios. But the samples in the spec- trometer chamber exhibit charge effects which decrease slightly as a function of irradiation time and contamination by carbon, which lowers the Si2p 70 signal by ~10% between the beginning and the end of the experiment (10 h). To minimize these effects, in each case the Si2p signal was recorded before and after Mo and Pt accumulation. The intensity ratios /(Mo3d)/ J(Si2p) and J(Pt4f)//(Si2p) were calculated using the area of the doublet and the average area of the Si2p signal recorded before and after accumulation. Concerning the binding energy (BE) calculations, we have observed a con- stant splitting between the Ols, Si2p and CIs kinetic energies. If the CIs core level is assumed to be at 285 eV, then the Ols and Si2p BEs are respectively 533.3 and 103.8 eV. This latter peak, the kinetic energy of which is averaged before and after accumulation, is used for Mo3dg/2 and Pt4f^^ BE deter- minations. Catalysts The support, high purity silica Aerosil 200 Degussa (BET surface area 200 m2 g~1, average particle size 120 A), was impregnated by aqueous solu- tions of chloroplatinic acid (Johnson Matthey) and of ammonium hepta- molybdate (Fluka). After evaporation, the solids were dried overnight in an oven at 110 C, then reduced under flowing hydrogen at 500 C. A series of Pt Mo catalysts were prepared with a constant metal atom content (Pt + Mo) of about 9.0 X 1019 metal atoms per gram of dried un- reduced catalyst (corresponding to about 2.9 wt.% platinum) with various proportions of platinum and molybdenum. These catalysts were designated PMDx, where P is for platinum, M for molybdenum, D for Degussa and x the relative atomic percentage of molybdenum in the total metal content (Pt + Mo). After reduction some molybdenum is lost, as can be seen in Table 1. Chemical analysis The chemical analyses were performed by the Service Central d'Analyse du CNRS. After dissolution of the samples, platinum and molybdenum were analyzed by atomic absorption. Results Adsorption Hydrogen chemisorption (HC) Hydrogen chemisorption was performed at room temperature with hydrogen pressure ranging between 50 - 300 torr. Under these conditions, after reduction and outgassing at 500 C, molybdenum in PMD100 does not chemisorb hydrogen. Then, by assuming that even in the presence of plati- num, molybdenum does not adsorb hydrogen, we are able to calculate plati- num dispersion from H^ chemisorption. The results are reported in Table 2. It is clear that HC and H/Pt decrease with increasing Mo/Mo + Pt ratio between 0 and 67%; thereafter, HC and H/Pt seem to be constant. However it must be pointed out that when Mo/Mo + Pt is higher than 50%, the accuracy of H/Pt is rather low. 71 TABLE 1 Mo and Pt weight contents of Pt Mo bimetallic catalysts Catalyst Treatment Mo (wt.%) Pt (wt.%) PMDO drying reduction 0 0 2.86 3.11 PMD14 drying oxidation\" 0.18 0.16 2.30 2.56 PMD28 drying reduction oxidation 0.40 0.34 0.34 2.12 2.16 2.14 PMD45 drying oxidation'1 0.56 0.49 1.39 1.51 PMD55 drying reduction oxidation8 0.79 0.68 0.72 1.32 1.35 1.41 PMD67 drying oxidation\" 0.92 0.75 0.95 0.90 PMD76 drying reduction oxidation 1.13 1.02 1.02 0.71 0.66 0.68 PMD87 drying oxidation'1 1.0 1.17 0.30 0.36 PMD100 drying oxidationa 1.70 1.55 0 a Oxidation at 300 C after reduction. It is well known that after reduction at 500 C, platinum is totally reduced but molybdenum is probably not [25]. Thus, in order to determine the degree of oxidation of molybdenum, after HC the catalysts were out- gassed and then reoxidized with oxygen at 300 C. Yermakov reoxidized Mo catalysts at 500 C [11] to Mo\"1\"6, but in the case of Pt Mo we must take into account the participation of platinum in the oxygen uptake. Since the plati- num surface is likely to be involved in this adsorption, it seemed better to try to adsorb oxygen at a lower temperature in order to avoid Pt sintering. Hence we have checked whether oxidation at 300 C can reoxidize molybde- num to Mo\"1\"6. PMD100 adsorbed 140 Jumol Oz per gram of catalyst at 500 C and 139 at 300 C. Thus 300 C seems a temperature high enough to obtain Mo\"1\"6, and we decided to measure the oxygen chemisorption at 300 C. For Pt alone, it was shown that only surface atoms are concerned with oxygen consumption, since a ratio OC3oo/HC of 1.17 was obtained for different platinum dispersions. It has been assumed that the ratio OC3oo/HC for plati- 72 TABLE 2 Hydrogen and oxygen chemisorption on Pt Mo: degree of oxidation of molybdenum Catalyst He\"-13 H/Pt (X^OO\"-\" HT^ x' in Mo** HTMo\" H/Mo y6inMo^-y PMDO 42.4 0.59 116.6 PMD14 32.3 0.55 53.0 123.7 2.42 15.8 1.9 2.94 PMD28 24.2 - 22.9 0.44 -0.42 64.0 117.0 1.92-1.75 40.5 2.0 - 2.3 2.91 PMD45 9.5 0.27 67.0 80.0 1.62 48.3 1.9 2.79 PMD65 5.0 0.15 80.0 43.3 1.94 26.6 0.73 2.64-2.77 PMD67 2.8 0.11 76.4 29.7 2.30 20.3 0.51 2.97 PMD76 2.2 0.12 89.6 13.7 2.72 6.3 0.12 3.08 PMD86 1.1 0.15 103.8 2.64 2.76 PMD100 0 139.0 0 2.55 0 0 2.55 - 2.86 140 (500 C) ^p.mol (g catalyst) 1. t> Hydrogen chemisorption at room temperature. \"Oxygen consumption at 300 C.

(I): 6-x Mo Mo^ + O2- (1) -0 The values of x are reported in Table 2. If the value obtained for PMD 14, which is not very accurate, is excluded, it is clear that platinum increases the degree of reduction of molybdenum when it is present at the surface of the catalyst in a noticeable proportion. This catalytic effect of platinum on the reduction of molybdenum com- pounds appears even at room temperature, since the values of HT, the amount of hydrogen consumed at room temperature after OCaoo. are much higher than they would be if only platinum surface atoms were concerned in the hydrogen titration of oxygen. In the seventh column of Table 2 we list the difference HTMo between HT experimental and the contribution of platinum to this hydrogen uptake, calculated using: HTMo =HT-3.34HC Its value increases up to 45% molybdenum and then decreases, but when HTMo is calculated for 1 molybdenum atom, as reported in the eight column of Table 2, it can be seen that about 2 hydrogen atoms are consumed per molybdenum atom up to 45% Mo. This number corresponds to the maxi- mum amount of hydrogen in molybdenum bronzes [26] and is close to the usual value of 1.6 -1.7 obtained by spillover using H^/Pt [34]. Probably 73 there is enough Pt on the surface of these catalysts to catalyse the total for- mation of bronzes. But when the proportion of molybdenum is increased, the formation of bronze may be incomplete, and its amount decreases with the proportion of platinum. XPS Platinum binding energy analysis Whatever the final treatment (H^ at 500 C or at room temperature, or 0; at 300 C), the Pt4f7/2 BE is always in the 71.4 - 71.8 eV range (see Table 3). These values are slightly higher than that recently reported for bulk platinum [27] of 71.1 or 71.2 eV. This positive shift may be due to several effects, i.e. (a) Adsorption of residual oxygen on the reduced samples during the transfer in the glove-box, which will give PtOads species whose BE was reported to be 71.8 eV [28]. Deep Pt oxidation to give PtO is more unlike- ly, as the Pt4f7/2 BE of PtO is 72.2 or 73.4 eV [28, 29]. (b) A metal-support interaction which involves a decrease in the elec- tron density of the supported metal. This interaction was reported for sup- ported Pt [30], Re [31] or Ir [32]. (c) Changes in the extra-atomic relaxation which occur during photo- emission when comparing bulk metal with small supported crystallites. As an example, Vedrine et al. [33] reported the Pt4f7/2 BE of Pt atomically dis- TABLE 3 Platinum binding energy analysis Sample Pt4f7/2 binding energy (eV) PMDO [HP 71.8 [0] 71.8 [H] 71.7 PMD28 [R] 71.8 [0] 71.8 [H] 71.4 PMD55 [R] 71.7 [0] 71.6 [H] 71.8 PMD76 [R] 71.8 [0] 71.8 [H] 71.7 \"[R]: reduced samples at 500 C.

(d) Electronic transfer between Pt towards Mo, except of course for the PMDO samples. These effects can be combined, but from a comparison between Pt SiO; and Pt Ti02, Fung [34] has shown that the major effect responsible for the position shift is the modification of extra-atomic relaxation of the small Pt crystallites when supported on SiO;. Thus we cannot conclude from this study that a SMSI occurs between Pt and SiO;, nor that an electron transfer occurs from Pt to Mo. Molybdenum The Mo3d3/2-s/2 spectra are reported in Fig. 1. After oxidation at 300 C (samples [0]), the apparent maximum, corresponding to the Mo3ds/2 level, is always in the 232.0 - 232.5 eV range whatever the sample composi- tion. This indicates the presence of Mo^ species (see Table 4), as expected from the calcination conditions. Interaction with N2 at room temperature (samples [H]) apparently does not cause any changes in the doublet shape except for the PMD28 sample, for which a maximum at 228.6 eV associated with a broad tail on the high binding energy side is clearly detected. This shift towards lower BE can be interpreted as partial reduction of Mo^. As this reduction occurs at room temperature only for the sample with high Pt loading, a hypothesis of formation of a bronze H :Mo03 by H spillover (under which conditions a Mo oxidation number lower than VI is expected to be present) is highly probable, as indicated by the adsorption experi- ments. However the position of the maximum we observed is lower than that reported for Mo^ in well-defined bronzes (Table 4). This observation is perhaps due to the presence of a Mo oxidation number between IV and 0 or to the fact that the bronze is well dispersed on a support and some interaction between Mo^ and Si02 may occur. The samples reduced at 500 C ([R]) (Fig. 1) give evidence of two maxima centered around 231.5 eV (probably Mov) and 228.1 eV which correspond without any doubt to metallic molybdenum. Obviously, these reduction conditions are more severe than those used by Tri et al. [12] on Pt Mo bimetallic catalysts supported on Y-zeolite (1 torr H2 at 573 K in the XPS chamber) for which no Mo was detected. By considering the Mo 3ds/2 peak (dashed line in Fig. 1) and the intensity ratio /(Mo3ds/2)/J(Mo3d3/2) equal to 1.5, the extent of reduction Mo /MOtotai can be estimated. We found 0.30 for PMD25, 0.26 for PMD50, 0.32 for PMD75 and 0.34 for PMD100. Within the experimental precision, no great variations are detected when the Pt loading is varied, which would indicate that there is no synergy effect for reducing the deposited Mo species to metallic Mo . However, some care has to be taken in considering the observed extent of reduction, as sintering of the Mo particles may affect the experimental ratios. 75 B.E..V 220 B.E, v B.E,.v 230 220 B.E.eV Fig. 1.

Mo and Pt repartition. As XPS is a surface-sensitive technique, modifica- tion of Mo and Pt repartition on the support as a function of the composi- tion or of the metal loading can be obtained by plotting the intensity ratios 7(Mo3d)/J(Si2p) or 7(Pt4f)/J(Si2p) as a function of the bulk (atomic) com- position (Mo/Si) or (Pt/Si). 76 TABLE 4 Mo3d5/2 binding energy: reference samples Sample Oxidation Binding number energy (eV) Calibration level Ref.

In Fig. 2, we have plotted the ratio 7(Pt4f)//(Si2p) (which is related to platinum particle size), versus the atomic ratio Pt/Si of the catalysts. The points can be considered in the vicinity of a straight line, taking into account the margin of error mainly due to Pt peak broadening. This shows that the proportion of platinum 'seen' by XPS, hence the platinum particle size, does not change significantly with the catalyst composition. We have also compared the experimental ratio J(Mo3d)//(Pt4f) to the bulk atomic ratio Mo/Pt of the catalysts (Fig. 3, curve a). The straight line obtained indicates that, in the layers analyzed by XPS, the composition is proportional to the bulk composition.

These reactions were performed at 300 C with butane and hydrogen pressures respectively equal to 0.1 and 0.9 atm. Figure 4 reports the variations in the activity of PMDx catalysts ex- pressed as molecules of butane transformed per hour per metal atom versus the atomic composition of the catalysts. A strong synergistic effect is ob- served since, when the activity is maximum, one metal atom would be about 24 times more active than one Pt atom in PMDO. Molybdenum is almost inactive at 300 C, and it is necessary to perform this reaction at 340 C to obtain a noticeable conversion. Moreover, at that temperature, with PMD100 the conversion of butane increases as a function of the reaction time corre- sponding to carburization of molybdenum (Fig. 5). A similar phenomenon has already been observed, for example by Sinfelt et al. [38] for the hydro- genolysis of ethane. However, it must be pointed out that the catalytic activities are calculated by extrapolation to zero of the curve: T vs. time and 79 0.6 0.4 0.2 Conversion Time [h] 0133 Fig. 6.

Tri et al. [13] qualitatively observed similar changes in the activities for hydrogenolysis of butane at 320 C and ratios P^/Pc = 40. The maximum they found was situated at a higher level of molybdenum: 50 to 60% against 30 to 40% Mo atoms in this work. In Table 5 we report the activities of the catalysts per gram of catalyst and per atom of metal, the activation energies, together with some selec- tivities: The ratios C^/C i of the mol.% propane to methane in the products at low conversion (in fact sometimes up to 15 - 20% conversion) give an idea of Fig. 6. Rate of benzene hydrogenation us. relative atomic Mo percentage. T = 50 C, PC H = 0.05 atm, PH. = -95 atm. the excess of methane produced with respect to the stoichiometry of reac- tion (2), and hence an idea of the relative importance of reactions (4) and (5) of multiple hydrogenolysis. The ratios Vy/Vy, of the rate of hydrogenolysis of the middle bond (reaction (3)) to that of the terminal bond (reaction (2)) give an estimate of the selectivities in the single hydrogenolysis. The ratios V^/Vy of the rate of isomerisation (reaction (6)) to that of hydrogenolysis (reactions (2 - 5)). It can be seen that the selectivities of PMDa: where x is different from 0 are quite different from that on platinum alone, but are similar to each other, except for PMD100. The same is true for the energies of activation. Hydrogenation of benzene was performed at 50 C with benzene and hydrogen pressures respectively of 0.05 and 0.95 atm. Figure 6 shows the changes in the rate of benzene hydrogenation as a function of the composi- tion of the catalysts. Here again the phenomenon of synergy appears with a maximum in activity around 25 - 30% molybdenum atoms, but it is much less important than in butane hydrogenolysis. Hydrogenation of cyclohexane was carried out at 270 C with Pen = 0.023 atm and PH, = 0.977 atm. The rate of this reaction decreases monot- onously almost linearly when the proportion of molybdenum increases (Fig. 7). 81 12 10 Fig. 7.

Discussion One of the most prominent features in this study is the apparent de- crease in platinum dispersion (H/Pt) in the bimetallic catalysts Pt Mo (Table 2). With PtMo on Y zeolite, Tri et al. [12] also reported such a decrease in hydrogen chemisorption. This could of course be a consequence of larger platinum particle sizes, but XPS measurements (Fig. 2) seem to indicate that the number of metal atoms analyzed by this method increases almost linear- ly when the platinum percentage is increased, which probably means that the particles containing platinum have almost the same size for all our PMDx catalysts. There remain two explanations to these observations proposed by Tri etal. [12]: a surface enrichment of metal particles with molybdenum (either Mo or Mo at various states of oxidation), or an electronic modification of platinum atoms by molybdenum lead- ing to an inhibition of hydrogen chemisorption on Pt. This last proposition has been discussed by these authors and does not seem very likely for reasons exposed in detail in ref. 13. Moreover, XPS experiments have evidenced that binding energies of 4f7/; electrons in platinum are constant within experimental error, whatever the catalyst com- positions. Of course, a slight modification not visible by XPS cannot be excluded. On the contrary, the first proposition of a molybdenum surface 82 enrichment is quite in agreement with XPS observations as seen in Fig. 3: the XPS ratio of Mo/Pt was calculated from the expression [36]: MMO _ J(Mo3d) gpt / (Pt4f) y-7 npt J(Pt4f) flTMo^(Mo3d); where a is the atomic cross section and E the kinetic energy. Curve b in Fig. 3 clearly shows that, for the three samples studied, the ratio Mo/Pt in the layers analyzed by XPS is notably higher than Mo/Pt in the bulk. Of course, this only means that near the surface of silica Mo is present in higher amounts than is Pt. This could be due to a molybdenum surface enrichment or to segregated Mo deposited on the support separately from bimetallic particles. As far as the state of oxidation of molybdenum is concerned, things do not seem very straightforward. It is clear that Mo is not completely reduced to Mo , but XPS shows that some molybdenum is reduced to the metallic state. Moreover it seems to indicate that the ratio Mo^Mo^ai 1s roughly con- stant and equal to about 0.3-0.35. The shape of XPS molybdenum broad peaks suggests that several degrees of oxidation are probably present. On the other hand, if the basic assumptions made are correct, oxygen uptakes in adsorption experiments show that the average degree of oxidation of Mo decreases when the proportion of platinum decreases if PMD14 is ex- cluded and XPS and adsorption results seem to be in disagreement. How- ever, it must be remembered that oxygen uptake is for all molybdenum atoms, but XPS can 'see' only some layers near the surface, each layer participating differently in the final signal. Thus it may be possible that in the few layers near the surface the proportions of Mo and Mo\"1\"* are constant, but that the reduction can go deeper when platinum is present in rather high proportion. Another explanation could be that the proportion of Mo is constant, but that the proportion of Mo\"1\"'\" to lower degrees of oxidation is higher in Pt Mo. Considering that the reduced samples have to be transferred through the glove box into the spectrometer, Mo could be reoxidized to a constant level by oxygen traces whatever the sample. However this does not seem very plausible although it cannot be completely excluded. Moreover, the calcula- tions of x in Mo+x could be questioned, since the assumptions could be wrong: the stoichiometry of oxygen adsorption on Pt at 300 C could be a function of the Mo content, or the surface composition could be different under oxygen at 300 C than under hydrogen at 500 C, or the ratios H/Ptg do not allow calculation of platinum dispersion Pts/Pt. In fact, it is quite possible that Ptg/Pt is constant for all the catalysts; this is not in disagree- ment with the proportionality of J(Pt4f)//(Si2p) to rip^/risi shown in Fig. 2. If the degree of oxidation of molybdenum is recalculated from these assump- tions: Pts/Pt =0.59 and OCpi/Pts = 1.17 as for PMDO, then the values y reported in the last column of Table 2 are obtained. It is unsettling to note that the same oxidation state, close to +3, is obtained for Mo in all catalysts. Moreover, if, as suggested by XPS, Mo is mainly present as Mo and Mo\"1\"5, 83 then the ratio Mo^Mo^ai corresponding to an average oxidation state of +3 is equal to 0.40, which is very close to the value obtained by XPS. This seems to be a good argument in favor of a constant platinum dispersion. Moreover, when HTMo and H/Mo as defined above are recalculated using this new set of hypotheses, new values for H/Mo are obtained: 1.17, 1.1, 0.84, -0.2, -0.15 and -0.25 respectively for PMD14-28-45-55-67 and 76. The slightly negative values are due to uncertainties in the measurements, and the ratios H/Mo for PMD55, 67 and 76 are probably close to 0. This in quite good agreement with XPS since among the 3 PMDs studied by XPS, PMD28 is the only one to exhibit a shift for the Mo3d signal indicating the forma- tion of molybdenum bronze. Catalytic activities Synergy effects have been observed for butane hydrogenolysis (strong) and benzene hydrogenation (weak) but not for cyclohexane dehydrogena- tion. Similar phenomena more important for hydrogenolysis than for hydro- genation were previously observed with other bimetallic systems such as Pt Re and Pt Ir [6 -10]. Moreover in these systems, the rates of dehydro- genation of 1,1,3-trimethylcyclohexane (Pt Re and Pt Ir) and of cyclo- hexane (Pt Ir) [10] decreased monotonously as a function of Re or Ir content. The catalytic analogy between Pt Re, Pt Ir and Pt Mo associa- tions is therefore obvious. Usually, two hypotheses are proposed as an explanation to these ob- servations on bimetallic catalysts: an electronic modification of Pt by the additive (and vice versa) resulting in an increased activity of this metal; a mixed site comprising both Pt and additive atoms could be more active than a site made of atoms of only one metal. For Pt Mo other hypotheses can be considered: an increase in Pt dispersion when Mo is added. However this assump- tion can be ruled out considering chemisorption results; as Mo is not totally reduced to Mo , it is possible that in the pres- ence of Pt at the surface, the extent of reduction of Mo would be increased, leading to catalytically active Mo. In fact if the ratio H/Pt reflects Pt dis- persion, the reduction of Mo seems to be increased in Pt Mo catalysts. How- ever, the new interpretation of the oxidation experiments reported above, together with XPS experiments, would indicate the contrary. It must also be considered that PMD28 and PMD55 have about the same average degree of oxidation when calculated using the assumption H/Pt = Ptg/Pt, but that they have very different activities. The same observations can be made for PMD76, PMD86 and PMD100. Therefore, it seems that if there is any change in the oxidation state of Mo, and if this oxidation state has an influence on the activities of Pt Mo catalysts, the phenomenon is not straightforward. Now emphasis can be put on the very different behaviour of the Pt Mo catalysts in cyclohexane dehydrogenation on the one hand, and butane hydrogenolysis and benzene hydrogenation on the other hand. Here, it may 84 TABLE 6 Rates of hydrogenolysis of butane, hydrogenation of benzene and dehydrogenation of cyclohexane per hydrogen adsorption site (mol h~1 H\"1) on Pt Mo catalysts Catalyst Hydrogenolysis Hydrogenation Dehydrogenation of butane of benzene of cyclohexane PMDO 8.7 0.53 xl03 1.6 xl03 PMD14 73.2-67.8 0.87 x 103 1.7 xl03 PMD28 321.1 -330.0 1.45 xl03 2.8 - 2.3 X 103 PMD45 663 1.80 X 103 3.3-3.5 X 103 PMD55 623 1.39 x 103 6.0 X 103 PMD66 607 1.23 x 103 8.35 X 103 PMD76 607 1.95 x 103 6.35-6.65 Xl03 PMD87 632 9.3-11.2 Xl03 first seem surprising that the rates of two opposite reactions do not change in a similar manner when the compositions of the catalysts are changed. However, it must be pointed out that the conditions of reactions are very different in the two cases: 50 C for benzene hydrogenation and 270 C for cyclohexane dehydrogenation. Hence the rate-determining steps could be different for the two reactions, the rates of these two steps being modified differently by changes in the catalysts. Another tentative explanation could be the occurrence of side effects such as coking at higher temperature. The cyclohexane dehydrogenation rate is roughly proportional to the platinum content (Fig. 7) which is again in favor of a constant Pt dispersion through- out the series of catalysts. If for all catalysts Ptg/Pt is equal to 0.59, the turnover frequency of platinum is 1560 h~1 under our experimental condi- tions with a margin of error of about 10% for all the catalysts. In contrast the rate of butane hydrogenolysis and of benzene hydro- genation on one platinum atom is not constant, as can be seen in Figs. 4 and 6. But if these rates are calculated for one hydrogen adsorption site, the results reported in Table 6 are obtained. It is remarkable that this rate in- creases for butane hydrogenolysis for PMDO to PMD45 and then remains constant. This can easily be explained if the rate-determining step of this reaction takes place on mixed sites of constant composition for all catalysts (these sites include at least one adsorption site for hydrogen). For catalysts relatively rich in platinum, there is not enough molybdenum for all Pt atoms adsorbing hydrogen to be included in active sites, the number of which is consequently lower than the number of hydrogen adsorption sites and in- creases with Mo content. This is the case for PMD14 and PMD28. The same explanation holds for benzene hydrogenation. Here, the site active for this reaction would be richer in platinum than that active in butane hydrogenolysis, provided, of course, that the surface composition is not modified by the different gas composition. This hypothesis of sites with constant activity and composition is in good agreement with the constant selectivities and activation energies ob- served in butane hydrogenolysis. 85 Conclusions There are three arguments in favor of a constant platinum dispersion (Ptg/Pt) throughout the series of Pt Mo catalysts studied here: the proportionality of Pt/Si detected by XPS to the nominal bulk Pt/Si ratio; the fair agreement between the oxidation degree of Mo calculated from XPS signals and from the amounts of oxygen used for the oxidation of Mo at 300 C, when it is assumed that Ptg/Pt is constant; the proportionality of the rates of cyclohexane dehydrogenation to the Pt content. It must be pointed out that if the platinum dispersion does not change with the catalyst composition, the decrease in H/Pt when the Mo content increases does not necessarily imply the occurrence of an electronic effect, but could be due to a dilution of Pt atoms with Mo if the dissociation of H^ molecule necessitates the presence of two adjacent Pt atoms. If Pts/Pt is really constant, then our catalytic measurements have shown that the rate-determining step of cyclohexane dehydrogenation occurs only on Pt surface atoms at 270 C. On the contrary, the rate-determining steps of butane hydrogenolysis and of benzene hydrogenation take place on mixed sites, including Pt surface atoms able to chemisorb hydrogen and molyb- denum surface atoms in a constant proportion whatever the catalyst com- position. Finally, the analogies between the catalytic properties of Pt Re, Pt Ir and Pt Mo systems allow us to foresee a possible replacement of costly bi- metallic catalysts by cheaper Pt Mo catalysts.

Bimetallic Pt-Mo catalysts deposited on silica, with an equal number of metal atoms per gram of catalyst, have been prepared by co impregnation of the support, then reduction at 500 °C under flowing hydrogen. XPS analysis indicates that the ratio I(Pt4f)/I(Si2p) is proportional to the ratio Pt/Si of the number of platinum to silicon atoms, and that molybdenum is only partially reduced to Mo°, the ratio Mo°/Mototal being roughly the same for all catalysts. The binding energy of 4d 7 2 Pt electrons is the same whatever the catalyst composition, indicating that if any electronic modification of Pt occurs it is very slight. Hydrogen chemisorption (HC) indicates that the ratio H/Pt decreases when the molybdenum proportion increases. Oxygen uptakes at 300 °C were measured, and the degrees of oxidation of molybdenum have been estimated using two different sets of hypotheses. These results have been discussed and compared to XPS results. The catalysts were then characterized by their activity in three organic test reactions. The rate of cyclohexane dehydrogenation at 270 °C is proportional to the amount of platinum present, but rates of butane hydrogenolysis at 300 °C and of benzene hydrogenation at 50 °C indicate the occurence of synergy effects which are stronger for butane hydrogenolysis. These results are discussed, and can be accounted for if the ratio Pts/Pt is constant throughout the series of catalysts. The rate-determining step of the cyclohexane dehydrogenation takes place only on surface platinum atoms. However butane hydrogenolysis and benzene hydrogenation probably occur on Pt-Mo at rates higher than on platinum. Mixed sites of the same composition are thought to operate on all the catalysts. Such active sites include at least one hydrogen adsorption site. References 1 a U.S. Pats. 3 415 737 (1968), to H. E. Kluksdahl. b U.S. Pats. 3 537 980 (1970) to H. E.

        "dc:description": "Bimetallic Pt-Mo catalysts deposited on silica, with an equal number of metal atoms per gram of catalyst, have been prepared by co impregnation of the support, then reduction at 500 °C under flowing hydrogen. XPS analysis indicates that the ratio I(Pt4f)/I(Si2p) is proportional to the ratio Pt/Si of the number of platinum to silicon atoms, and that molybdenum is only partially reduced to Mo°, the ratio Mo°/Mototal being roughly the same for all catalysts. The binding energy of 4d 7 2 Pt electrons is the same whatever the catalyst composition, indicating that if any electronic modification of Pt occurs it is very slight. Hydrogen chemisorption (HC) indicates that the ratio H/Pt decreases when the molybdenum proportion increases. Oxygen uptakes at 300 °C were measured, and the degrees of oxidation of molybdenum have been estimated using two different sets of hypotheses. These results have been discussed and compared to XPS results. The catalysts were then characterized by their activity in three organic test reactions. The rate of cyclohexane dehydrogenation at 270 °C is proportional to the amount of platinum present, but rates of butane hydrogenolysis at 300 °C and of benzene hydrogenation at 50 °C indicate the occurence of synergy effects which are stronger for butane hydrogenolysis. These results are discussed, and can be accounted for if the ratio Pts/Pt is constant throughout the series of catalysts. The rate-determining step of the cyclohexane dehydrogenation takes place only on surface platinum atoms. However butane hydrogenolysis and benzene hydrogenation probably occur on Pt-Mo at rates higher than on platinum. Mixed sites of the same composition are thought to operate on all the catalysts. Such active sites include at least one hydrogen adsorption site.",
