A simple preparation of an efficient heterogeneous gold catalyst for aerobic amine oxidation Linda Aschwanden Tamas Mallat Frank Krumeich Alfons Baiker ⁎ Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, ETH Hönggerberg, Wolfgang Pauli Strasse 10, CH-8093 Zürich, Switzerland ⁎ Corresponding author. Tel.: +41 44 632 31 53. Graphical abstract For the oxidation of amines a very simple preparation of a heterogeneous gold catalyst has been developed. The catalyst has a comparable or even superior activity compared to other formerly published or commercially available catalysts. Numerous sophisticated techniques have been applied in the past years for the preparation of supported gold catalysts designed for oxidation reactions. Here we show that it is possible to arrive at an efficient catalyst without using any conventional step for the synthesis of supported gold nanoparticles. The reaction studied was the oxidative dehydrogenation of amines to imines with molecular oxygen. The catalyst precursors Au(OAc)3 and an oxide support were simply added to the reaction mixture and the active gold nanoparticles on the support were formed in situ. The corresponding imines were produced in 89–100% yield and the catalyst was proved to be truly heterogeneous and recyclable. Despite of the simplicity of the method, the activity of the catalysts was comparable, or even superior, to other known catalysts of the oxidative dehydrogenation of amines and to some commercially available supported gold catalysts. Keywords Gold nanoparticles Catalyst preparation Aerobic oxidation Amine Imine 1 Introduction The interest in gold catalysis has increased rapidly after the fundamental work by Bond, Hutchings, and Haruta in gold-catalyzed hydrogenation, hydrochlorination, and oxidation reactions, respectively [1–3]. It is now well established that the outstanding catalytic properties of gold is related to the appropriate preparation of nanoparticles. An important field of catalytic uses is oxidation [4–6], including the oxidation of aldehydes [7–9] and alcohols [10–14], and the epoxidation of olefins [15,16]. A recent application is the oxidative dehydrogenation of amines to imines with molecular oxygen, in which reaction even non-nanogold – i.e. gold powder – has detectable activity [17], although remarkably lower than that of small gold particles deposited onto an oxide support [18,19]. Imines are crucial intermediates in the synthesis of biologically active nitrogen compounds [20,21]. Selective oxidation of amines to the corresponding imines [22,23] offers an alternative route to the mostly applied synthesis, the condensation of an amine with a carbonyl compound. Table 1 presents an overview on the catalysts that are active with molecular oxygen as the only oxidant in the transformation of dibenzylamine to dibenzylimine, a commonly used test reaction. Note that depending on the catalyst, the oxidation of amines may lead to various other products, such as nitriles [24], oximes [25], amides [26], enamines and heteroaromatic compounds [27], and carbonyl compounds and carboxylic acids [28]. Most of the gold catalysts used for aerobic oxidations have been prepared in a similar way: a gold salt, frequently HAuCl4, is applied in the presence of a support and the precursor salt is transferred to metal nanoparticles by reduction or calcination. For example, preparation of the Au/Al2O3 catalyst used for the oxidative transformation of amines to imines involves the impregnation of Al2O3 with a HAuCl4 solution, a reduction step in H2 at 300°C, and additional calcination at 700°C [18]. Equipments necessary for the last two steps are not commonly available in a synthetic laboratory. Our aim was to develop a simple and efficient method for the synthesis of active gold catalysts. We have shown recently [19] that gold acetate adsorbed onto ceria from an aqueous solution is more active in the oxidative dehydrogenation of dibenzylamine to dibenzylimine (Scheme 1 ) than any other known catalyst (Table 1). Importantly, neither a reduction nor a calcination step was necessary to obtain the active catalyst, since the gold nanoparticles were formed in the reaction mixture, as demonstrated by in situ XANES and electron microscopy. Here we report a further development, in which case there is no need for any ex situ preparation step of the gold catalyst for the efficient transformation of amines to imines. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials The Au/CeO2 (A) catalyst [29] was purchased from the laboratory of Professor Corma. The Au/TiO2 (B) and Au/ZnO (C) catalysts and the Al2O3 support were generously provided by AuTek. The SiO2 support (Aerosil®380) was kindly supplied by Evonik (Degussa). The TiO2 support (Aeroxide® P25) was purchased from Acros and the CeO2 from Micro Coating Technologies. According to TG analysis, CeO2 contained a small amount of nitrate that was removed by calcination at 500°C for 4h before use. The BET surface area after calcination was 117m2/g. The Au(OAc)3 (99.9%) was purchased from AlfaAesar. 2.2 Oxidative dehydrogenation of amines According to the standard procedure, the reaction was carried out in a 25mL two-neck pear-shaped flask equipped with a cooler to which a balloon, connected through a three-way tap and filled with oxygen, was attached. Ground gold acetate (2.6mg) and 118.6mg support were added and air was replaced with oxygen after evacuation. Through a septum, 3mL solvent (dried with MS 4Å) was injected and the stirring was turned on (1000rpm). Then the amine (0.4mmol) and an additional 2mL of solvent were added and the flask was immersed into a pre-heated oil bath. In the case of the oxidative dehydrogenation of dibenzylamine at the end of the reaction diphenylamine was added as the internal standard for GC analysis. After oxidation of benzylamine and indoline the yields were determined by NMR after the catalyst was filtered off and the solvent was evaporated. If not mentioned otherwise, the transformation of dibenzylamine with ex situ prepared catalysts was performed similarly. The reaction flask containing the catalyst was filled with oxygen, 1.5mL of dried toluene was added, and the stirring was started (750rpm). Dibenzylamine and then an additional 1.5mL of toluene were added. The reaction was initiated by immersing the reactor into a pre-heated oil bath. Turn over frequency (TOF) was calculated based on the conversion of the amine (Eq. (1)): (1) TOF = n ( amine converted ) n ( Au ) total × t In Eq. (1) the total amount of gold applied in the reaction was considered, since the fraction of surface gold atoms is frequently not available. When the conversion was not mentioned in the literature, the yields were used to estimate the TOF. These approximate TOF values are marked by an asterisk. The approximation did not cause a significant error since the yields were typically higher than 90%, except for the Au powder (64% yield, TOF=0.001h−1 [17]). In this case the TOF would be only 0.0016h−1 even if 100% conversion is assumed (see Table 1). Note also that any comparison based on TOFs is only semi-quantitative, since the reaction conditions are partly different and usually not optimized. The gold content of the filtrate after the oxidation of indoline was determined (at ALAB AG, Switzerland) by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The detection limit of the method was 3ppm. After evaporation of the chlorobenzene the residue of the filtrate analyzed was 28.6mg. 2.3 Catalyst characterization The particle size of gold nanoparticles was studied with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). After the oxidation reaction the catalyst was filtered off, washed with ethyl acetate, and dried in vacuum at room temperature. The dry powder was dispersed in ethanol and deposited onto a perforated carbon foil supported on a copper grid. The investigations were performed on a Tecnai F30 microscope (FEI (Eindhoven), field emission cathode, operated at 300kV). STEM images obtained with a high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector revealed Au particles with bright contrast (Z contrast). EDXS spot analysis confirmed that the bright patches corresponded to Au. The specific surface area of CeO2 was measured using nitrogen physisorption at 196°C on a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 apparatus. The 5-point BET method was applied in the range 0.05< p/p 0 <0.25. The sample was degassed at 100°C for several hours before the measurements. The UV–vis spectrum was measured in a quartz cuvette by using the deuterium light source of a DH2000 spectrometer (Micropack). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Development of the catalyst preparation method As mentioned in the introduction, dibenzylamine could be efficiently oxidized to dibenzylimine with molecular oxygen (Scheme 1), using Au(OAc)3 adsorbed onto CeO2 (Table 2 , entry 1) [19]. According to XANES measurements and electron microscopy, the catalytically active species were gold nanoparticles, which formed in situ at the support surface. Interestingly, gold ions could not be detected in the liquid phase by XANES, suggesting that Au(OAc)3 was anchored strongly onto CeO2 and did not dissolve as an amine complex before its reduction to metal. We tried to simplify the catalyst preparation and avoid the adsorption step, thus making the amine oxidation procedure more attractive as a laboratory method. At first, we ground gold acetate and CeO2 together. Although grinding is not an efficient way to disperse the active component of the catalyst onto the support, the activity and selectivity were reasonably good (Table 2, entry 2). We could go even further and omit any ex situ preparation step by directly adding the gold salt and the support into the reaction flask (Table 2, entry 3). Astonishingly, this in situ “evolved” catalyst was more active than the ground catalyst, and on the basis of the reaction rate (TOF) and imine yield its performance is similar to the best commercial supported gold catalysts (Table 2, entries 4–6). It is probable that at first a gold–amine complex is formed, which is reduced subsequently to Au nanoparticles. The conditions applied in Table 2 are not optimized. Interpretation of the influence of various reaction parameters is not straightforward, since not only the oxidative dehydrogenation of the amine itself but also the properties of the in situ formed catalyst are affected. An example is the effect of solvent (Table 3 , entries 1–3). The reaction was the fastest in chlorobenzene and the more polar butyl acetate seems to be less suitable. Beside the oxidation reaction itself, the solvent influences also the solubility and the stability of the amine complex, and thus the properties of the in situ formed gold nanoparticles. In addition, at close to the boiling point the partial pressure of oxygen (at a total pressure of 1bar) varies strongly with the vapor pressure of the solvent. In chlorobenzene the reaction rate could be improved by increasing the reaction temperature, without any negative effect on the imine selectivity (Table 3, entries 3 and 4). Working at higher temperature accelerates the removal of water co-product. In aerobic oxidations in the liquid phase, removal of water from the reaction mixture is frequently the rate limiting step [30]. In addition, water is detrimental to the imine selectivity, as it will be discussed later. The last three entries in Table 3 demonstrate that not only CeO2 but also other common supports, such as TiO2, SiO2, or Al2O3 are suitable for the in situ catalyst preparation method (entries 3 and 5–7). Among the supports, TiO2 seems to be the least appropriate due to the moderate selectivity. It has been reported recently that TiO2 in the form of anatase is a good catalyst for the oxidation of amines to oximes [26] (see also Table 2, entry 5), although in our case using the TiO2 (“P25”) as support oximes did not form in detectable amounts (Table 3, entry 5). To prove that the in situ prepared gold catalyst is truly heterogeneous, the reaction presented in Table 3, entry 3 was repeated and stopped after 3h, at 60% conversion. The reaction mixture was filtered through two layers of a very fine filter (Whatman Glass Microfibre Filter GF/D; between the layers 2g Celite was packed). After separation, the reaction was continued with the filtrate under the same reaction conditions for 2h but the conversion did not change. Hence, the presence of dissolved active species can be excluded. The reusability of the in situ prepared catalyst was also investigated. After the experiment described in Table 3, entry 3 the catalyst was filtered off, washed with the solvent chlorobenzene and dried over night at room temperature in vacuum. The second run under the same conditions gave only 67% conversion, probably due to the presence of some surface impurity not removed by the simple washing with the solvent [18]. 3.2 Characterization by electron microscopy The gold catalysts prepared in various ways were characterized with electron microscopy. The small gold particles on CeO2 are hardly recognizable because of the relatively small difference in Z of Ce and Au. Therefore, for this study titania-supported catalysts were used since on titania even sub-nm gold particles are clearly visible in the HAADF-STEM images. The bridging experiments in Table 3 demonstrate that both supports are suitable to prepare active catalysts. Most gold particles, formed from Au(OAc)3 preadsorbed onto TiO2 during the oxidative dehydrogenation of dibenzylamine [19], have diameters in the range 5–10nm but some smaller and much larger (up to ca. 40nm) particles are also seen (Fig. 1a). The particles are well dispersed over the support. When the catalyst is prepared by grinding Au(OAc)3 and TiO2 together, the typical diameters of the Au particles formed prior to amine oxidation are in the range 30–50nm (Fig. 1b) but smaller particles of ca. 5nm can be seen as well. When Au(OAc)3 and TiO2 are simply added to the reaction mixture, the in situ formed gold has also bimodal particles size distribution: besides the large particles in the range 20–40nm, there are also small nanoparticles with an average diameter of around 5nm (Fig. 1c). In the last two cases the gold particles are less evenly dispersed on TiO2 than in the catalyst where Au(OAc)3 was pre-adsorbed onto TiO2 from a dilute aqueous solution [19]. An average particle size for these catalysts could not be calculated due to the very broad and uneven particle size distribution. Fig. 1d shows the electron micrograph of the reference catalyst Au/TiO2 (B). Here the gold particles are well dispersed and their size is in the range 1–12nm. On the basis of the smaller gold particle size and the corresponding higher specific surface area, Au/TiO2 (B) would be expected to be more active than our Au/TiO2 formed in situ from Au(OAc)3 and TiO2 (Fig. 1c), which is not the case. Clearly, the particle size alone cannot explain the performance of various supported gold catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of dibenzylamine. 3.3 Oxidative dehydrogenation of various amines It is expected that in the in situ preparation of supported gold catalysts the amine substrate itself plays a key role in the formation and properties of the gold nanoparticles. To test the applicability of the catalyst preparation method, we extended the study to the oxidative dehydrogenation of a primary amine (benzylamine) and a heterocyclic amine (indoline). The oxidative dehydrogenation of benzylamine yielded only dibenzylimine without any detectable side product (Scheme 2 ). Zhu et al. have shown recently the formation of imines through the coupling and oxidative dehydrogenation of primary benzyl amines catalyzed by Au/Al2O3 [18]. In contrast, Cu-based catalysts facilitate the formation of imines together with the formation of some nitriles [31,32], and mainly nitriles are produced by the aerobic oxidation of primary amines with Ru-based catalysts [24,33–35]. As illustrated in Fig. 2 , oxidative dehydrogenation of benzylamine with the Au/CeO2 catalyst formed in situ from Au(OAc)3 and CeO2 is slower than the transformation of dibenzylamine. Still, in the oxidative dehydrogenation of benzylamine, the TOF at 89% conversion was 3.2h−1, and the catalyst seems to be considerably more active than the “conventionally” prepared Au/Al2O3 (TOF* =0.3h−1 [18]). The higher selectivity of benzylamine oxidation are understandable when considering the reaction route involving the oxidation of both benzyl- and dibenzylamines (Scheme 3 ). Oxidative dehydrogenation of dibenzylamine gives dibenzylimine and water, but also benzonitrile, benzylamine, and benzaldehyde are formed. The latter two byproducts are the result of the hydrolysis of dibenzylimine with the coproduct water [36] and benzonitrile is formed by oxidative dehydrogenation of benzylamine. The amounts of the byproducts after 5h reaction in chlorobenzene were 0.4%, 7.8%, and 0.5% for benzylamine, benzaldehyde, and benzonitrile, respectively. The low benzylamine/benzaldehyde ratio can be explained by the previously described route, the coupling and oxidative dehydrogenation of benzylamine to dibenzylimine. The small amount of benzonitrile indicates that the direct oxidation of benzylamine to benzonitrile is very slow. We can conclude that under the reaction conditions applied here the coupling and oxidative dehydrogenation of benzylamine to dibenzylimine is much faster than the hydrolysis of dibenzylimine and the oxidation of benzylamine to benzonitrile. The high selectivity of the coupling and oxidative dehydrogenation of benzylamine can be explained also by the Le Chatelier's principle: benzylamine is present in much higher concentration during its oxidative dehydrogenation than as a by-product during the oxidative dehydrogenation of dibenzylamine to dibenzylimine. Oxidation of indoline to indole was remarkably faster than the two reactions discussed previously. Quantitative transformation without any detectable byproduct was achieved within 1.5h, with a TOF of 38.5h−1 (Scheme 4 ). For comparison, in former reports on this reaction the TOF values varied between 18 and 25h−1 [33,34]. Another special feature of this reaction was that the filtrate after reaction was not colorless but purple, indicating the presence of some very small, colloidal gold particles. Still, the amount of gold remained in solution was negligible, below the detection limit of the ICP-OES analysis. We could not find any gold in the filtrate also by STEM analysis combined with EDX. In contrast, with UV–vis spectroscopy we could detect the plasmon resonance for metallic gold between 500 and 600nm. In a control experiment we repeated the oxidation of indoline and stopped the reaction after 30min, at a conversion of 79% and 100% selectivity. After separation of the catalyst, no further reaction was detectable in the filtrate in the subsequent 50min reaction under otherwise identical conditions. It concludes that the amount of gold in the filtrate was negligible. The catalyst filtered off after the reaction was studied with STEM. Here again, TiO2 was used in the oxidation reaction instead of CeO2 to allow detection of the gold particles. The particle size distribution was relatively narrow ranging from less than 1 to 6nm, and no larger particles could be found. Fig. 3 shows an example where the whole particle size range is seen but in most other regions of the sample the proportion of the 4–6nm particles was low and particles below 2nm were dominant. A comparison of Figs. 3 and 1c reveals that the gold particles formed from the Au(OAc)3 +TiO2 mixture in the presence of indoline are remarkably smaller than those produced with the contribution of dibenzylamine. 4 Conclusions In conclusion, we have developed a very simple route for the synthesis of gold catalysts for the oxidation of amines. There is no need for any ex situ preparation step before the reaction because the active gold nanoparticles are generated in situ. The method can be easily applied in a synthetic chemical laboratory, not equipped for the preparation of heterogeneous catalysts. Despite of the simplicity of the method, the activity and selectivity of the catalyst in amine oxidation are excellent. The method can be applied for the oxidative dehydrogenation of various amines to imines. Acknowledgements We thank ETH Zürich for the financial support.
