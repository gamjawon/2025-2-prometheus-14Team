CHANCE and TERENCE A. NILE* Department of Chemistry, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Greensboro, NC 27412 (U.S.A.) (Received October 8,1986; accepted April 14, 1987) Summary The activity of rhodium phosphite complexes as catalyst precursors for hydrosilylation reactions has been investigated. These are found to be active for a wide variety of organic substrates. Both hydride clusters, [RhH{P(OR3)}2L and chloride dimers, [RhCl{P(OR)3}2]2 (R = methyl or o-tolyl) were evaluated. The hydrosilylation of 1-hexyne by triethylsilane was investigated as a function of phosphite :rhodium ratio and also with various phosphites as ligand. Introduction There is great current interest in the synthesis of transition metal clusters, especially as such compounds are expected to have novel catalytic activity [1]. Rhodium phosphite clusters, [RhH{P(OR)3}2]n (R = Me, n = 3; R = i-Pr, n = 2; etc.), have been investigated extensively by Muetterties and co-workers, who have shown them to be active alkene and akyne hydro- genation catalysts [2]. We report in this paper on the use of rhodium phosphite complexes as catalyst precursors for the hydrosilylation of a wide variety of unsaturated compounds. Two types of rhodium phosphite complexes were investigated as hydrosilylation catalysts: the bridged hydride clusters, I, and the chloride bridged dimers, II. The chloride bridged dimers [RhX{P(OR)3}2L la X = H, R = Me, n = 3. Ib X = H, R = 2-C(,H4Me. IIa X = Cl, R = Me, n = 2. lib X = Cl, R = CeHUMe. were synthesized from dichlorotetrakis(cyclooctene)dirhodium(I), [RhCl]- (CgHi4)2]2, and the appropriate amount of phosphite [3, 4]. The corres- ponding hydride clusters were formed in situ from the chloride and lithium *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/87/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 92 triethylborohydride [5]. The catalytic effectiveness of both types of com- plex was evaluated for the hydrosilylation of a wide variety of unsaturated organic substances. Experimental General procedures All reactions were carried out under pure nitrogen using freshly distilled dry liquids. 'H NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Associates T60 spectrometer. IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 457 grating spectrophotometer. The GC analysis of reaction products was carried out on a Varian A-700 'Autoprep' gas chromatograph using a 6 ft column of 10% SE30 on Chromasorb G. The silanes were purchased or prepared according to literature methods [3, 4]. The phosphites were prepared from phospho- rous trichloride and the corresponding phenol [6, 7], except for trimethyl- phosphite, which was a commercial sample dried over sodium and freshly distilled. [RhCUCgH^als was prepared by a literature method [8]. Hydrosily la tions These were carried out using methods outlined in previous publications [9]. The products of the hydrosilylations in some cases were isolated and identified by comparison of their spectral properties with authentic samples [10], but in most cases were identified by comparison of their GLC charac- teristics with authentic samples. Results collected in the Tables were ob- tained by quantitative reactions carried out as outlined in footnotes to the Tables, and yields were calculated using an appropriate internal standard. Typical experimental procedures are reported in detail below. Hydrosilylation of 2,3-dimethyl-l,3-butadiene by triethylsilane catalyzed by la IIa (23 mg, 3.0 X 10~2 mmol) was placed in a flask and dissolved in 5 ml THF. The solution was cooled to 78 C and 60 Jul of a 1.0 M (6.0 X 10\"2 mmol) solution of lithium triethylborohydride in THF was added. The solution was allowed to warm to room temperature. The solvent was re- moved under reduced pressure and 2,3-dimethyl-l,3-butadiene (1.0 ml, 0.73 g, 8.8 mmol) and triethylsilane (1.0 ml, 0.73 g, 6.3 mmol) added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. Quantitative analysis of the reaction mixture by GLC using a 6 ft column of 10% SE30 on Chromo- sorb G with decane as an internal standard indicated a quantitative yield, based on triethylsilane, of 1:1 adducts, with a 90:10 ratio of 1-triethyl- silyl-2,3 -dimethylbut-2 -ene: 4-triethylsilyl-2,3 -dimethylbut-1 -ene. Hydrosilylation of 1-octene by triethoxysilane catalyzed by lib fib (49 mg, 3.0 X 10~2 mmol) was added to a degassed solution of 1-octene (1.0 ml, 0.72 g, 6.4 mmol) and triethoxysilane (1.0 ml, 0.96 g, 93 5.4 mmol). The mixture was placed in an oil bath at 100 C for 2 h. GLC analysis of the reaction mixture using decane as an internal standard indi- cated a 67% yield of 1-triethoxysilyloctane, based on silane. Hydrosilylation of 1-hexyne by triethylsilane catalyzed by lid [RhCl(CsHi4)2]2 (21 mg, 3.0 X 10~2 mmol) was dissolved in 10 ml dichloromethane. Tris(2,6-xylyl)phosphite (47 mg, 12 X 10~2 mmol) was added and the solution was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. The vola- tiles were then removed under reduced pressure. 1-Hexyne (1.0 ml, 0.72 g, 8.7 mmol) and triethylsilane (1.0 ml, 0.73 g, 6.3 mmol) were added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. GLC of the reaction mixture using decane as a standard indicated a 38% yield (based on silane) of (rans-1-triethylsilyl-l-hexene. Results and discussion The rhodium phosphite complexes are moderate hydrosilylation cata- lysts for a variety of unsaturated organic molecules, as can be seen from the results in Table 1. The activities of the hydride complexes la-b and the chloride complexes IIa-b are comparable. This is not surprising, as silanes are effective transition metal reducing agents [II], and could easily reduce the chloride complexes to the corresponding hydrides. The trimethylphosphite clusters la and IIa are excellent catalysts for the hydrosilylation of 2,3-dimethyl-l,3-butadiene by triethylsilane at 25 C, however the ratio of the two isomeric 2,3-dimethyl- butenes formed varies. l-Triethylsilyl-2,3-dimethyl-2-butene, the 1,4-adduct, is almost exclusively formed with la, whereas considerably more 4-triethyl- silyl-2,3-dimethyl-l-butene is formed with IIa. This perhaps suggests that there are subtle differences in the catalytic intermediates formed from the two catalysts. la and IIa catalyze the hydrosilylation of carbon-oxygen double bonds by triethylsilane, both in saturated ketones, i.e. cyclohexanone, and in unsaturated ketones, i.e. mesityl oxide. With both catalysts, the activity increases with temperature. The opposite temperature dependence occurs on hydrosilylation of 1-octene by triethylsilane, where activity is moderate at 25 C and poor at 100 C with both la and IIa. With hydrosilylations involving triethoxysilane, the yields are lower than those obtained with triethylsilane, except those involving 1-octene. Complex IIa is uniformly more active than la with triethoxysilane. We also synthesized the tris-o-tolylphosphite analogues of la and IIa, and investigated the catalytic activity of these two complexes, Ib and lib. Tris-o-tolylphosphite is a sterically more demanding ligand than trimethyl- phosphite, and its complexes are often coordinatively unsaturated, for example [Ni{P(0-o-CfiH4Me)3}3] is readily formed in solution [12]. Such complexes display interesting catalytic activity [13].

An interesting feature is that higher yields (although not ex- cellent) are obtained with alkoxysilanes and 1-octene with the bulkier phos- phite, P(o-OCeH4Me)3, than with P(OMe)3 as ligand. Hydrosilylation of alkynes As it has been shown that the product distribution obtained from the hydrosilylation of alkynes is very dependent on subtle changes in the cata- lyst system used [9], we have investigated the hydrosilylation of 1-hexyne by triethylsilane using the rhodium phosphite complexes IIa-d, The products of this hydrosilylation [RhCl{P(OR)3}2L IIa R = Me lib R = 2-CgH4Me He R = 2-C6H4But lid R = 2,6-C(,H;)Me2 consisted of trans- and cis-l-triethylsilyl-l-hexenes (eqn. (1)). n-C4H9C=CH + HSiEta > c!'s-/^rans-n-C4H9CH=CHSiEt3 (1) Table 2 shows the variation in yield and isomer ratio for the hydro- silylation of 1-hexyne by triethylsilane catalyzed by [RhCl{P(OR)3}]2, as different phosphites were used as ligands. The yield at 25 C after 18 h drops as o-substituted arylphosphites are used in place of P(OMe)3. This is due to their increasing steric hindrance; however, the selectivity is much greater for the bulky phosphites, as they give only ^ ans-l-triethylsilyl-l- hexene, by cis-addition of the silane.

Table 3 presents the results obtained when the ratio of trimethylphos- phite:rh odium is varied. The yield of 1-triethylsilyl-l-hexene is essentially quantitative at trimethylphosphite: rhodium ratios of 1:1 and 2:1. These results are similar to those obtained with triphenylphosphine rhodium com- plexes in the hydrosilylation of 1-pentyne by triethylsilane, where the yield of 1-triethylsilyl-l-pentene reaches a maximum at triphenylphosphine: rhodi- um ratios of 0.5:1 and 1:1 [9]. The yield for the trimethylphosphite- rhodium system shows a dramatic decrease as the trimethylphosphite :rhodium ratio is increased past the optimum. Catalytically active intermediates The nuclearity of the catalytically active intermediates is unknown at this time, and cluster fragmentation cannot be ruled out based on the product distributions obtained.
