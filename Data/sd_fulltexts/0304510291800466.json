Rooney School of Chemistry, The Queen's University, Belfast B7'9 SAG (U.K.) (Received September 20, 1990; accepted January 12, 1991) Abstract Norbornadiene hydrogenates on Cu and Au dispersed on basic supports such as Mg0 to give significant yields of nortricyclene in addition to norbomene and norbornane, whereas only the latter products are found using Pt on the same supports as catalysts. This novel finding is evidence for a mechanism where surface olefin-metal complexes and not the metal atoms per se are directly involved in activating molecular hydrogen. Dissociation of HZ is then a step which occurs simultaneously with the addition of the first H atom to the adsorbed olefin and is not a prior independent event, as is thought to be the case in conventional mechanisms. The new mechanism helps to explain why metals with low or negligible capacity for hydrogen chemisorption, e.g. Pt/Ti02 after high temperature reduction, are still very effective hydrogenation catalysts. Introduction Suggested mechanisms and kinetic analyses of the multiple exchange reactions of paraffins with deuterium on noble metal catalysts such as Pd and Pt have always assumed [ 1 ] that there is a surface pool of highly mobile and readily available H and D adatoms. The interchange of positions of these isotopic species and the adsorption and desorption steps involved in the overall reaction, HZ + DZ i=:t 2HD, were thought to be sufficiently rapid in the presence of the organic substrate as never to be rate limiting. The hydrogen released from the paraffin during the exchange reaction was therefore considered to be always statistically scrambled with deuterium, both on the surface and in the gas phase. On this basis the classical a,/3-exchange mechanism for ethane is depicted as the interconversion of monoadsorbed ethyl and 1,2-diadsorbed ethane (or alternatively Tr-bonded ethylene) with loss or pick up of an atomic species X (X = H or D) in each elementary step. -x -x CZX6 X C 2X5 X CXZ- CXZ ---- CXZ CXZ M M M 0304-5102/91/$3.50 1991- Elsevier Sequoia, Lausanne 340 However, recent studies [ 2 ] of the reaction of cyclopentane with D2 On Pt jTi0z catalysts have raised very interesting questions concerning the fundamental assumption of a surface pool of H/D atoms. When Pt/Ti02 is reduced in HZ at 773 K rather than at 473 K, a strong metal-support interaction takes place (SMSI state) which does not reduce the Pt surface area appreciably, but reduces the capacity of the metal to chemisorb hydrogen to negligible proportions. Surprisingly, the high temperature reduction (HTR) does not have a similar dramatic effect on the rates of reactions of paraffins in excess H2, e.g. hydrogenolysis, cyclization and 1,2-bond shifts [3, 4]. These observations led us to use the cyclopentane/DZ exchange reaction as a chemical probe of the nature of the active sites in the Pt/Ti02 catalysts [2]. The effect of HTR (773 K) compared to low temperature reduction, LTR (473 K), on the initial rates of exchange and the distributions of deuteroisomers was quite small, even though chemisorption measurements confirmed that HZ uptake fell to negligible proportions after the HTR pretreatment [3, 4 ]. In a similar fashion H2/D2 equilibration catalysis is unaffected [5]. Since paraffinic C-H activation is more difficult than that of H-H or D-D, two major conclusions are immediately evident. Relatively few sites of a defect type, most likely coordinatively highly unsaturated individual surface metal atoms [61, are required for all of the above catalytic reactions [3, 4]. A surface pool of H/D atoms is not essential to explain the kinetics and mechanisms of the exchange reactions. However, the theory requires that an available pool exists somewhere in the system, so the only logical conclusion is that it consists of the H2, HD and Dz molecules in the gas phase. A corollary to this statement is that the individual steps in the a, 3-process can involve molecular and not necessarily atomic H or D atoms, e.g. C2X5 X CXZ ~ CX2 +X2 ~M/ M A mechanism analogous to but a development of the classical Eley-Rideal mechanism for H2/D2 exchange [7] is envisaged. We therefore decided to test this idea using olefin hydrogenation and a variety of catalysts consisting of Pt, Au and Cu supported on various oxides. The olefins chosen as model substrates were norbornene and norbornadiene, since their structures preclude formation of -rr-allylic species, while the diene affords a selectivity parameter, namely the relative yield of intermediate norbornene. Cyclohexene was also used, since it is the classical strain-free cyclic olefin, whereas norbomene and norbornadiene have considerable strain energies. The coinage metals were included for examination, since they do not appreciably chemisorb HZ [81 nor do they hydrogenate simple strain-free alkenes. Experimental and results Supported metal catalysts (2 wt.% metal) were prepared by the aqueous impregnation methods previously described [31, using Cu(N03)2 and AgN03 341 (Aldrich), (NH4)ZPtCls, HZPtCl. and HAuC14 (Johnson Matthey); Pt02 was used as received from Johnson Matthey. The supports consisted of Si02 (Crossfields)calcined at 500 C before use, high purity Ce02 and Mg0 (B.D.H.), and Degussa P25 Ti02 calcined at 300 C. After impregnation the catalysts were dried at 120 C and then reduced in flowing hydrogen with the temperature raised over a 6 h period to the maximum, which was maintained overnight. Hydrogenation of norbornene (NBE) and norbornadiene (NBD) was then carried out in the same flow reactor after the temperature had been lowered to its chosen value. The catalyst (1.5 g) was used at atmospheric pressure with a flow rate of 3.5 cm' per min, while a total of 100-200 mg of substrate was vapourized into the hydrogen stream over 3 h. The effluent was collected and analysed using a 25 m capillary (BP1) GLC column operating at 50 C. The rates of hydrogenation were investigated at room temperature using a static reactor coupled to a gas burette under atmospheric pressure of H2. In a typical run, 20 cm' of ethanol was used as solvent with 200 mg supported catalyst (20 mg in the case of Pt02) and 1.0 g of reactant. The reactor and gas burette were degassed and flushed at least three times with HZ and the catalyst then introduced under H2. A further degassing and flushing was then carried out, the system isolated and the olefin (dissolved in 2 cm' ethanol) introduced through a rubber septum. GLC analyses were performed periodically by withdrawing samples through the septum in order to test the extent of hydrogenation, especially when uptake of HZ had ceased, and to examine the nature of the products. All the catalysts, including Cu and Au, > 80 C were very effective at hydrogenating NBE and NBD in the flow system. However, a remarkable distinction noted between Pt and the coinage metals was that catalysts of the latter, but never the former, invariably gave substantial yields of nortricyclene (NTC) in addition to NBE and norbornane (NBA) when NBD was the reactant. For example Cu/Si02, reduced at 550 C, at 100% conversion of NBD at 155 and 210 C afforded almost a 50/50 mixture of NTC and NBA. At higher temperatures up to 305 C, cracking became an increasingly important reaction, giving cyclopentadiene as the most significant side product. The catalyst rapidly deactivated under more severe conditions. It was partly reactivated by heating in OZ at 500 C followed by H2 reduction once more at 550 C. The first run at 155 C then gave 15% conversion of NBD with the following products, NBE (5.49/0), NTC (7.6/0) and NBA (20/0). When NBE was the substrate instead, using fresh Cu/Si02 reduced at 550 C, only NBA was observed as a product up to - 320 C, where the high temperature and surface acidity produced significant yields of NTC by carbonium ion rearrangement [9 ]. Cracking was also significant at these higher temperatures. The idea of intervention of surface acidity was tested by a run carried out using fresh catalyst under NZ at 320 C. The major result was 54% conversion to NTC with only 1% NBA detected. In order to rule out the possibility that Bronsted acid sites (detected by a positive response of activated Si02 to triphenylmethanol indicator in dry benzene) were also responsible for the formation of NTC during hydro- 342 ml 260 240 220 200 180 160 140 120 100 go 60 40 20 o i 0 1 2 3 6 f % s r?~1 I e 'o a P 0 i/l t , i09 r I,r d Il . 0r ~~j 20 40 60 80 100 min Fig. 1.

Flesh CU/Si02 was prepared and treated at room temperature with an aqueous solution of Na2C03, dried, and then reactivated again at 550 C in H2. The treatment by Na+ ions eliminated all activity for isomerization of NBE to NTC, but when NBD was hydrogenated at 160 C the products obtained consisted of NBE (16%), NTC (39%), and NBA (45ss'o) at 100% conversion. Cu/Mg0 was then prepared and two samples reduced at 550 343 and 350 C respectively. Both had excellent long-lived activities for hydrogenation of NBD and NBE. However, while NBE even at 320 C gave only NBA, NBD hydrogenation invariably resulted in NTC appearing as a major product at > 100 C, the only exception being one run at 80 C using the 550 C reduced sample where the conversion of NBD was only 22ss'o, with the products consisting of NBE (10%) and NBA (12%). Reduction at 350 C gave a somewhat less active catalyst, with no hydrogen uptake observed at 80 C using either NBD or NBE as reactant. Ag/Si02 was tried and found to be inactive after various reduction treatments up to 550 C. However, a Cu/Ag (1/1)-Si02 catalyst reduced at 550 C, although significantly less active than CU/Si02, gave very similar product distributions for NBD hydrogenation. Au/Si02 was very like CU/Si02 in all aspects, although it was also less active, giving only 62% conversion of NBD in the first run at 160 C with a product distribution of NBE (28%), NTC (26ss'o) and NBA (8%). Cyclohexene did not hydrogenate on Cu and Au at 160 C in the flow reactor. The coinage metals were also inactive for NBE hydrogenation in the static reactor under the conditions described, but all the Pt catalysts were effective, even for cyclohexene. A selection of results is shown in Fig. 1. The Pt/Ti02 catalyst reduced at 200 C was most active, whereas the same catalyst reduced at 530 C was the least active. Pt/Ce02 was reduced at 350 C and Pt/Si02 at 530 C. The rates were all zero order in olefin concentration and the reactions went to 100% completion. The zero-order dependence was maintained until all the olefin was consumed, as can be seen from the linear plots and sharp cut-offs at the points of completion. Discussion Several important novel features emerge from these results. The first is the surprising observation that the rates of hydrogenation vary so little, especially when it is realized that the Pt/Ti02 catalysts reduced at 550 C had negligible capacity for chemisorbing HZ [3]. Secondly, NBE and NBD also hydrogenate readily on Cu and Au, metals which also do not chemisorb H2 [8]. Thirdly, NBD turns out to be a very valuable probe for diagnosing the mechanism of hydrogenation. Quite clearly the conventional mechanism of hydrogen addition does not apply to Pt/Ti02 (HTR) and even less so to Cu and Au, as there is no surface pool of H adatoms. The natural conclusions are that it is the metal-olefin complex and not the metal per se which activates molecular hydrogen, and that only relatively few defect sites may be responsible. The observation that NBD hydrogenates on Cu and Au to give substantial yields of NTC provides powerful evidence for the validity of the following mechanistic description. Reversible interconversion of a bis-olefin complex and the corresponding metallacyclopentane is a well-known reaction in organometallic chemistry 344 [ 10 ]. Theoretically the extension of this idea to the interaction of an olefin-metal complex with molecular hydrogen weakly held by the same metal atom or ion is justified. This is a novel idea for the mechanism of heterogeneous hydrogenation (Scheme 1), which also accords with the widespread observations that such reactions are frequently first order in HZ concentration but zero order in olefin. Strong adsorption of the latter and weak bonding of each Hz are obvious from the model, with each species noncompetitively complexed to the same metal atom or ion. One hydrogen atom then adds to the olefin while the other becomes a hydride ligand. In this way there is direct interconversion of an alkyl-metal-hydride and a [7r-olefin]-HZ-metal complex. This constitutes a novel way of regarding the nature of the a, 6process and provides the most direct means of exchanging H atoms in organic substrates. One canonical representation shown in Scheme 1 which may be very important is that in which the olefin-metal is depicted as a 1,3-dipolar complex undergoing a [3 + 2 ] addition to a polarized H-H molecule. The formation of NTC by hydrogenation of NBD on Cu and Au is very good evidence that this transition state and mechanism are valid for these metals. If NBD is chemisorbed as a di-Oo bidentate complex, a strong 1,3-dipolar interaction of one of the double bonds will engender sufficient carbonium ion character for the adsorbate to undergo a homo-allyl rearrangement into the corresponding nortricyclic complex. Now a [4 + 2 ] dipolar addition to the HZ ligand can be envisaged as shown, followed by reductive elimination to give NTC. The dipolar mode seems to be more important on the less active coinage metals, but could still apply to Pt. The ambiguity here is that NBD and NBE may prefer to adsorb and react with the exo faces oriented towards the surface. If this is so the homo-allyl rearrangement is no longer feasible, even if the complex is sufficiently dipolar. We therefore intend to test Pt and other catalysts further using model substrates, such as 7,7- M ~ M/ ii H ~1 ~`__-H \"~ -H f ~M~H /C~M, H ~ -C~M~-I H H - ' +/ ( /H M M----H M H Scheme 1. 345 dimethylnorbornadiene, in which the methyl substituents will preclude the exo mode of chemisorption. Some very recent work in the organometallic field lends powerful support to the above mechanism. In the photocatalytic hydrogenation of norbornadiene by W(CO)s or Mo(CO)6 [ 11 ], the products are NTC and NBE as in the present work on Cu and Au. Several intermediate (?I'-NBD)(q'-NBD)M(CO)3 complexes were characterized and the interaction of NBD and HZ ligands in various (7l'-NBD)M(CO)3(H2) species described. The authors [ 11 ] apparently do not fully appreciate the significance of the dipolar modes of olefin complexation in forming NTC. Such modes do not require the presence of molecular hydrogen since, it is worth noting, when NBD is refluxed with Mo(CO)s heptacyclo [ 6.6.02,6.03, 13.0',11.05,'0.' o,\"]tetradecane is formed in good yield [12]. This compound can only be formed via a 1,4-dipolar nortricyclic Mo complex, such as depicted in Scheme 1, undergoing a [ 4 + 2 ] electrocyclic addition reaction with a second NBD molecule. The di-endo mode of complexation of both NBD ligands in the key intermediate responsible, (NBD)ZMo(CO)Z, was proven [ 121. Another very significant relevant piece of work is that by Harman and Taube [13], who have recently identified [Os(NH3)5(H2)1\"+ complexes (n=2 or 3) and found that they will hydrogenate acetone to isopropyl alcohol. This work indicates that 1,3-dipolar states may be very important in activating ,;r-bonds between heteroatoms for hydrogen addition as shown in Scheme 1. Indeed [3 + 21 additions to HZ may explain the activity of Cu in hydrogenating ',C=O unsaturated groups. The extension of the idea to the interaction of C02 with H2 adsorbed on Cu provides an explanation why COZ apparently increases the steady-state surface density of H adatoms during methanol synthesis from CO and HZ [14]. A 17T*-C021[H2]CU complex will form which will be converted by a [ 3 + 21 dipolar electrocyclic type reaction into the corresponding formate-Cu-hydride complex. Decomposition of the formate ligand will then afford a second hydride ligand and recovered CO2. The latter gas therefore acts as a cocatalyst for dissociative chemisorption of hydrogen molecules on Cu. Ideas such as these may have much more general validity for surface reactions involving H2. Some years ago Thomson and Webb [ 15 ] addressed the problem of the mechanism of olefin hydrogenation on metal surfaces. They concluded that a pool of H adatoms on the metal is not present but rather the H adatoms are held by polymeric carbonaceous material formed as a surface layer from olefin. The present mechanism is a radical development of this line of thought, arriving at the ultimate conclusion that the available H atoms required for hydrogenation may only be present as weakly held H-H complexes. Indeed a layer of H adatoms strongly attached to a metal surface could now surprisingly be regarded as a poison for hydrogenation in some cases, preventing the formation of the required [.7r-olefin] [HZ]metal complex which is the active species. Following the identification of a relatively stable ethylidyne [ 16] complex arising from adsorption and reaction of ethylene on noble metal catalysts, 346 it was suggested that this species act as a H atom carrier for hydrogenation in a manner similar to that postulated for carbonaceous material [ 15 ]. A concerted mechanism for hydrogenation of ethylene was constructed [16] whereby two contiguous ethylidenes give up their a-H atoms to the olefin and are simultaneously converted into ethylidynes. It was pointed out [17] that this mechanism is untenable on several grounds, so it is unfortunate that it has again been highlighted in a recent review [ 18 ]. The first serious flaw is kinetic, since the mechanism clearly demands that the rates of hydrogenation of ethylene should be first order in olefin whereas they are often zero order. The second difficulty is that on symmetrical and orbital grounds the reaction suggested is thermally forbidden. This is immediately evident by consideration of the analogous hypothetical concerted reaction of ethylene with cyclohexa-1,4-diene to give ethane and benzene; although thermodynamically quite feasible, this reaction is theoretically thermally disallowed and does not proceed. Thirdly, more recent work [ 19 ] has shown that ethylidynes are essentially only spectator species during ethylene hydrogenation. Finally, we wish to emphasize that we are not ruling out the conventional mechanism involving prior dissociation of HZ for every type of hydrogenation. Rather we are drawing attention to the possibility that a novel heterogeneous mechanism with counterparts in the homogeneous field involving direct interaction of molecular hydrogen with substrate-metal complexes may have widespread importance.

        "dc:description": "Norbornadiene hydrogenates on Cu and Au dispersed on basic supports such as MgO to give significant yields of nortricyclene in addition to norbornene and norbornane, whereas only the latter products are found using Pt on the same supports as catalysts. This novel finding is evidence for a mechanism where surface olefin—metal complexes and not the metal atoms per se are directly involved in activating molecular hydrogen. Dissociation of H2 is then a step which occurs simultaneously with the addition of the first H atom to the adsorbed olefin and is not a prior independent event, as is thought to be the case in conventional mechanisms. The new mechanism helps to explain why metals with low or negligible capacity for hydrogen chemisorption, e.g. Pt/TiO2 after high temperature reduction, are still very effective hydrogenation catalysts.",
