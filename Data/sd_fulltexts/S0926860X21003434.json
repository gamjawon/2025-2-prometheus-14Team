Graphical abstract The gas-phase epoxidation of propylene with H2 and O2 has been explored by a number of researchers due to its green nature. It is an environmentally more benign and more efficient alternative to existing industry processes, such as the chlorohydrin method and hydroperoxide process. As the catalyst for this reaction, Au/TS-1 plays a critical role. In this review, we aimed to disclose the correlation between Au/TS-1′s catalytic property and the synthesis/modification strategies. Reaction mechanism was firstly summarized involving the generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) catalyzed by Au particles and epoxidation reaction catalyzed by TS-1 zeolites. Subsequently, the effects of different Ti species, Au particle size, loading position and chemical state on catalytic performance were discussed. Based on this, the modified strategies of TS-1 surface property and pore structure, synthesis methods for obtaining small and highly dispersed Au particles in deposition-precipitation (DP) process were emphasized. Pretreatment of Au/TS-1 catalyst to diminish hydroxyl defects and make it active in specific atmosphere were also demonstrated. Keywords Au/TS-1 Gas-phase epoxidation of propylene Au active sites Hierarchical TS-1 Pretreatment 1 Introduction Propylene oxide (PO), an important propylene based chemical intermediate, is mainly used in the production of organic raw materials like polyether polyols and propylene glycol, which are widely applied in the fields of food, tobacco, cosmetics, medicine and etc. The development of daily necessities has raised increasing demand for PO. Nowadays, PO is mainly produced by the chlorohydrin method and the hydroperoxide process, as shown in Fig. 1 . Although the chlorohydrin process shows the advantages of high product selectivity and low construction investment, the use of highly toxic chlorine reagents leads to equipment corrosion and the generation of harmful byproducts. In view of people's increasing awareness of environmental protection and hence more strict laws, the chlorohydrin process is to be abandoned eventually. The hydroperoxide process avoids the drawbacks of environmental pollution and serious corrosion, but it suffers from long process, high investment and strict requirements on the quality of raw materials. Most importantly, the ethylbenzene/isobutane hydroperoxide process co-produces a large amount of styrene/tert-butyl alcohol, which strongly influences the economy of this process. To solve the problems of the above industrial PO production routes, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) oxidized PO preparation (HPPO) catalyzed by titanium silicate-1 zeolites (TS-1) was developed, with water as the only co-product in theory, as illustrated in Fig. 1. At present, researchers have obtained a deep understanding of this reaction’s mechanism and have scaled it up to industrial production [1,2]. However, in view of the high cost and risk of H2O2 transportation, a H2O2 manufacture plant is usually built close to the PO plant, to obtain the highest economic benefit [3]. A great deal of efforts had been made to remove this limitation before the route of gas-phase propylene epoxidation was found, in which H2O2 was first synthesized by H2 and O2 and then consumed in-situ to oxidize propylene to PO. Compared with the HPPO process, this gas-solid reaction shows obvious merits of easy operation, simple product separation and high economic benefit. The realization of gas-phase epoxidation of propylene is mainly driven by the development of Au based catalyst. In 1998, Haruta's group proposed for the first time that Au/TiO2 could catalyze propylene to produce PO with high selectivity under H2 and O2 atmosphere. Since then, a variety of Au-Ti catalysts, such as TS-1, TS-2, Ti-Beta, Ti-MCM-41, Ti-MCM-48, Ti-SBA-15 and etc, have been prepared and their catalytic performance have been investigated, as shown in Table 1 . It was found that, compared with metal oxide support, Ti-containing zeolites showed better catalytic property, proposed explanation being that their regular pore structure could impose geometric constraints on Au particles to prevent them from migrating and aggregating [4]. Among them, TS-1 zeolite has attracted extensive attention after its success in industrial production. Au/TS-1 catalyst has been optimized to further improve its catalytic performance by changing pH value of deposition solution and adding promoter in Au loading process, as well as modifying the pore structure of TS-1 support [5]. These modification strategies of Au/TS-1 catalysts have been reviewed in this paper and the development direction has been proposed in order to promote the large-scale utilization of the gas phase epoxidation process. 2 Reaction mechanism and related side reaction Au/TS-1 catalyst shows excellent catalytic performance for gas-phase epoxidation of propylene, attributed to the synergistic effect between Au particles and TS-1 zeolites [18]. Au active sites catalyze H2 and O2 to generate H2O2, which is utilized in-situ in the epoxidation of propylene adsorbed on the framework Ti atoms of TS-1 support [19]. However, there are two different views of the specific route: the sequential mechanism and the simultaneous mechanism. The sequential reaction mechanism suggests that the generated H2O2 is transferred to the adjacent Ti-defect sites of TS-1, resulting in the formation of Ti-OOH species, which as active sites subsequently catalyze the epoxidation of propylene to PO [20,21], as shown in Fig. 2 (1). Haruta et al. provided evidence for this mechanism by detecting the existence of Ti-OOH species on the surface of Au/Ti-SiO2 catalyst via in-situ UV–vis characterization. The absorbance peak at 370 nm implied the charge transportation between -OOH and Ti4+ [22]. At the same time, it was found that the formation rate of the Ti-OOH species was much lower than its consumption rate [23], suggesting that the generation of H2O2 was the rate-limiting step [24]. However, due to the lack of transient kinetic data, it was difficult to confirm the Ti-OOH species was indeed the reaction intermediate, and therefore researchers had raised questions against the sequential reaction mechanism. For example, Thomson et al. calculated the energy barrier of Ti-OOH generation catalyzed by tetra-coordinated Ti sites adjacent to Au nanoparticles and that catalyzed by the isolated framework Ti atom. The fact that the former (32.1 kcal/mol) was significantly higher than the latter (16.8 kcal/mol), implied that the sequential reaction mechanism was kinetically inhibited [25]. Delgass et al. determined the reaction order of H2, O2 and propylene to be 0.60, 0.31 and 0.18 respectively, suggesting a minimum of two active sites working in conjunction, which could not be met by the sequential reaction mechanism. Therefore, the gas phase epoxidation of propylene is considered to proceed more likely via the simultaneous reaction mechanism [26,27], including the direct epoxidation between the H2O2 generated on Au nanoparticles and the propylene adsorbed on Ti active sites, as shown in Fig. 2(2). The rate-limiting step of this route is the attack of propylene to the H-Au-OOH species to produce PO and water, which needs both Au nanoparticles and tetra-coordinated Ti atoms. The gas phase epoxidation of propylene involves multiple active sites and raw materials, so various kinds of side reactions occur simultaneously with PO’s generation [28], as shown in Fig. 2(3). For example, propylene can be oxidized into acrolein or be hydrogenated into propane. In addition, PO products tend to stay on the catalyst surface rather than desorb from the active site in time, causing its ring-opening to generate propanal or acetone by-products, or being converted to CO2 or cracked into ethanal by deep oxidation. 3 Active sites and modification strategies of TS-1 support 3.1 Active sites of TS-1 zeolites for the epoxidation reaction Delgass et al. found that Au supported on TS-1 zeolites had the best catalytic performance compared with rutile, anatase and amorphous titanium species, indicating that tetra-coordination Ti atoms were active sites for gas phase epoxidation of propylene [29]. Non-framework Ti species such as TiO2 were responsible for the cracking of propylene to ethanal and the deep oxidation of PO to CO2 [30,31]. Furthermore, DFT calculation suggested that the [Ti(OSi)3OH] species were more active than fully coordinated Ti species, which may be due to the fact that H2O2 was easier to coordinate with the [Ti(OSi)3OH] species of low steric hindrance [32]. Besides, Haruta et al. suggested that Si-OH or Ti-OH defects were conducive to the anchoring of Au particle. These hydroxyl groups act as electron donors to transfer electrons to adjacent Au particles, after which O2 captures electrons on the surface of Au to form O2− intermediates, improving the generation of H2O2 [33]. However, too many acidic hydroxyl structures would enhance the irreversible adsorption of PO, resulting in ring-opening reaction and further oligomerization, rearrangement, cracking and coupling [34]. Carbonaceous deposits formed from these side reactions accumulate in the channels with time on stream and are prone to block the micropore, leading to catalyst deactivation [35–37]. Therefore, TS-1 support needs to have sufficient framework Ti sites to capture propylene and to catalyze the epoxidation reaction, and meanwhile, the transport property of TS-1 support also has to be enhanced to promote PO desorption in time. 3.2 Modification of TS-1 pore structure and surface property Liu et al. introduced Au/TiO2 into SBA-15 material and found that its catalytic performance was significantly improved, because the mesopores of SBA-15 allowed PO to desorb quickly from the catalytic center [17]. In addition, Haruta et al. found that the catalytic performance of Au/sponge-like Ti-Si material was also improved, due to the three-dimensional mesopore structure (>7 nm) of support, which was beneficial for the diffusion of reactants and products [38]. Inspired by the results above, hierarchical TS-1 zeolites with mesopore structure and small grain TS-1 had been developed, as shown in Fig. 3 . Sheng et al. synthesized HTS-1 zeolites with mesopores (45 nm) by “resolution-crystallization” method using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as template. The stability of Au/HTS for the gas phase epoxidation of propylene was as long as 100 h, significantly better than that of the Au/TS-1 catalyst, whose activity kept declining. It was found that the coke generated during the reaction partially resided in the mesopores, which effectively alleviated the blocking of micropores. Moreover, mesopores can improve the migration rate of H2O2 from Au particles to framework Ti atoms, resulting in the improvement of H2 efficiency by 30 % [10]. Feng et al. synthesized TS-1/S-1 supported Au catalyst with Ti-rich shell and Si-rich cores, whose stability reached more than 100 h, due to its unique core-shell and mesopore structure [39]. Ma et al. also synthesized Au/TS-1 catalyst with mesopore of 3.3 nm, whose catalytic stability was up to 120 h [40]. Small grain TS-1 zeolites can be obtained by adjusting the synthesis strategy to promote the formation of crystal nuclei. In the hydrothermal synthesis process, increasing the concentration of organic template aids to accelerate the formation of TS-1 crystal nuclei [41]. In the dry-gel synthesis process, using high concentration of precursor and limited amount of water facilitated the rapid generation of a large number of crystal nuclei at the early stage of crystallization and their slow growth, resulting in the generation of small grain TS-1 zeolites [42,43]. Feng et al. synthesized TS-1 zeolites with small crystal size (<100 nm) and mesopores (ca. 3 nm), resulting in the PO formation rate up to 140.8 g h−1·kgcat −1 and selectivity up to 91.2 % [44]. Small grain TS-1 zeolites not only obtain enhanced mass transfer ability, but also improve the catalytic performance by their physical-chemical structure. XPS characterization shows that the morphology of small grain is more conducive to the electron transfer between the Au-Ti bi-active centers, enhancing their synergistic effect: the Au species with higher electron binding energy can promote the formation of H2O2, meanwhile, the Ti active site with lower electron binding energy is also beneficial for the activation of propylene. Therefore, small-grain TS-1 zeolites as support can improve both H2 efficiency and PO selectivity [45]. In order to prevent carbon accumulation caused TS-1 deactivation, the template blocked TS-1 zeolites can also be directly employed as the support. Because the micropores of the blocked TS-1 zeolites are filled with template, it is difficult for the reactants and products to enter the channels. PO generated on the surface of catalyst is easily desorbed at the reaction temperature, thus avoiding the product accumulation [46]. Studies have shown that the generated H2O2 decomposes a small amount of template to release amines, which is helpful to anchor Au particles and make them migrate into the formed micropores near the external surface, creating more Au-Ti sites for the epoxidation reaction [30]. In order to strengthen the Au particles loading, Delgass et al. pretreated the TS-1 surface with NH4NO3 to produce abundant NH2, which increased Au capture efficiency by 75 %, attributed to the coordination effect between NH2 group and Au particle [47,48]. 4 Active Au particle and its loading method 4.1 Au active sites for the generation of H2O2 According to the mechanism of gas phase epoxidation of propylene, Au nanoparticles are the key active sites to generate H2O2. Studies have shown that their catalytic activity is greatly affected by particle size, location and chemical state [49]. Au species generally exists in the form of single atoms, bilayers of Au, sub-nm clusters, clusters (1−2 nm) or nanoparticles (NPs, 2−5 nm), as shown in Fig. 4 . Researchers have different views on the influence of Au species’ size on their catalytic performance. One view is that Au particles smaller than 2 nm are the most active for epoxidation, whereas these larger than 2 nm promote the direct oxidation of propylene to acrolein and the combustion of H2 to H2O [50]. It was suggested by Li et al. that Au clusters smaller than 1 nm increase the possibility of OOH*’s rapid transportation to adjacent tetra-coordination Ti atoms [51,52]. Alternatively, Oyama et al. believe that Au NPs rather than Au clusters are the active centers for epoxidation reaction, and Au particles larger than 5 nm are responsible for the hydrogenation of propylene to propane [53]. Au particles are usually composed of multiple Au atoms arranged in a directional manner, including low-coordinated atoms located at corners and edges and other atoms in the bulk, on the crystal face or terrace with higher coordination number [54]. Larger Au particles have more high-coordinated atoms. The generated H2O2 therein cannot be transported to the Ti active site in time, but to decompose into H2O or used in nonselective oxidation [55,56]. As the size of Au particles decreases, the ratio of low-coordinated Au atoms increases, allowing faster migration of H2O2 to adjacent Ti active sites and therefore improving H2 utilization [57]. Taking all these into the consideration, it is necessary to keep more Au species existing in small size to maintain their high catalytic ability. Au particles are able to diffuse into the micropore of TS-1 zeolites only when their size is less than 0.56 nm, which is the diameter of the narrow ten-membered channel in the MFI structure. Au particles larger than that can only stay on the surface [58]. Whether Au particles inside TS-1 channels are more active for epoxidation reaction than those sitting on the surface is still controversial. Ma et al. prepared “core-shell” Au/S-1/TS-1 catalyst by loading Au on (S-1)-coated TS-1 material, the low catalytic activity of which indicated that it was the Au particle inside channels that played the dominant role, as the steric hindrance caused by S-1 made it difficult for the propylene to access the Au-Ti active sites inside the channel [59,60]. Moreover, Feng et al. also demonstrated that tiny Au species were prone to move into the micropores by longer aging time of Au slurry and higher Si/Ti molar ratio of TS-1, which were much more active than Au particles on the external surfaces of TS-1 [61]. However, Lu et al. found that Au particles were highly dispersed on the exterior surface of the pore-blocked TS-1 zeolite and exhibited excellent catalytic performance, with a propylene conversion of 8.1 % and a PO selectivity of 82 %. It was believed that the pore structure of TS-1 zeolite might not be essential for PO synthesis, and the Au-Ti sites located on the external surface were the essential catalytic centers [62]. Au freshly deposited on the TS-1 support mainly exists in its ionic state (Au1+) with a small amount of Au° and Au3+ species, shown by XPS spectra. Lin et al. found that catalyst with high content of Au° species showed excellent PO formation rate compared with that containing much Au1+ and Au3+ species, which is in accordance with results obtained by Li et al. [63]. It is generally accepted that O2 is activated to O2 − via the electron transportation from Au, and then O2 − reacts with H2 to generate -OOH species. Therefore, Au species with abundant electrons favors the generation of H2O2. This was proved by DFT calculation about the adsorption of O2 to Au (Au°), Au2O (Au1+) and Au2O3 (Au3+) systems. Au° (100) and (111) surfaces delivered more electrons (−0.74e and −0.54e) to O2 molecules than other Au species, and O2 adsorbed on them had longer OO bonds [64]. It was concluded that Au° species showed better activation ability to O2 than Au1+ and Au3+ species, and produced more activated O2 − to subsequent epoxidation reaction. At the same time, Lin et al. also reported that Au1+ was mainly responsible for the hydrogenation of propylene to propane [53]. 4.2 Optimized Au deposition method The impregnation method was applied to prepare Au catalysts in early days utilizing HAuCl4 as the impregnation solution. However, the remaining Cl− on the surface of the TS-1 support promotes the aggregation of Au atoms, leading to the generation of large Au particles (>30 nm). Besides, Cl- poisons the Au active sites and brings a negative effect on the gas phase epoxidation of propylene [65,66]. Therefore, deposition-precipitation (DP) method has been frequently used to load Au on the TS-1 support in recent years. In this process, with the addition of alkaline precipitant, HAuCl4 was gradually hydrolyzes into [Au(OH)Cl3]-, [Au(OH)2Cl2]-, [Au(OH)3Cl]- and [Au(OH)4]- species and eventually deposited on the support. At the final stage of deposition, Au solution was nearly colorless, indicating that most of the chloride ligands were replaced by the hydroxyl groups [67]. Actually, the Au deposition is realized through a surface reaction between the hydrated Au species and the hydroxyl groups on the surface of TS-1 [9]. However, only a small fraction of Au (usually less than 5 wt%) could be deposited on the TS-1 zeolite by the DP method, and the neutralizing agent, pH value and support properties all had important effects on Au loading. Particularly, Au loading capacity could be limited by high pH during neutralization, low Ti content and high hydrophobicity of the TS-1 support [29]. Precipitating agents commonly used in the DP process include NaOH [43], Na2CO3 [27,50], Cs2CO3 [57,68] and urea (CO(NH2)2) [62]. Compared with other precipitants, urea aids to obtain higher Au capture efficiency, due to its slow hydrolysis rate, which can gradually and homogeneously release OH− to avoid the local increase of the pH value of the synthesis suspension. In addition, NH4 + species obtained from urea hydrolysis removes residual Cl− ions from the precursor HAuCl4, avoiding Au species agglomeration via condensation reaction [47]. Li et al. found that the Au particle size gradually decreased with the increase of urea amount, and when Au3+/urea molar ratio was 1/100, Au particle size was usually less than 2 nm [31]. Meanwhile, longer contact time allowed the incorporation of Au species into the microporous channels via binding with hydroxyl groups, which facilitated the anchor of Au on the TS-1 zeolite [69]. During DP process, the surface charge state of the support is a key parameter to determine the actual Au loading, which depends largely on the matching of TS-1′s isoelectric point (IEP) and the pH value of the slurry solution. Higher pH environment increases the negative charges on the surface of TS-1 (IEP = 2–3), establishing a stronger repulsion force between TS-1 surface and the anionic Au species, preventing their adsorption. In order to deposit more Au particles on TS-1, lower solution pH is preferable. However, solution of too low pH may lead to incomplete hydrolysis of HAuCl4, causing Cl− to remain on the catalyst as a poison by forming Au-Cl species [65,70]. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust the solution pH appropriately to maximize the hydrolysis of HAuCl4 and improve the Au loading at the same time. HAuCl4 is usually hydrolyzed to [AuCl(OH)3]− and [Au(OH)4]− at pH of 7, which is also appropriate for Au deposition on TS-1. In addition, alkali cations can be added to balance the negative charges between the TS-1 surface and the Au hydrolyzed species to enhance their interaction in deposition process, resulting in higher Au loading on the support [71], as shown in Fig. 5 . TS-1 with higher Ti content or without calcination can also be used as support to enhance Au loading. It was shown that when the feeding Ti/Si molar ratio exceeded 0.025, titanium-silicon sol crystallized to produce TS-1 zeolites containing considerable amount of TiO2 (IEP = 4–5) [72], with less negative charge on the surface and consequently higher Au adsorption [14]. In addition, studies showed that the blocked TS-1 (IEP = 7.1) zeolites had strong interaction with negative Au anions, like [AuCl(OH)3]− and [Au(OH)4]−, and hence a higher Au loading efficiency [73]. Based on this, Ma et al. found that partly blocked TS-1 showed higher formation rate of PO than blocked TS-1, due to the increased number of Ti active sites in channels with the removal of template by calcination. In addition, XRD characterization showed that the relative intensities of crystal planes of (101) and (501) increased after the decomposition of template, contributing to the adsorption of propylene, which was of benefit to improve the catalytic activity [74]. 4.3 Au-metal/TS-1 catalyst The generation of H2O2 is of vital importance in the gas phase epoxidation of propylene, which is catalyzed by the Au active site. Researchers tried to further accelerate this rate-determining step by introducing other metal active sites into Au/TS-1 catalyst. At present, the introduction of Ag [35,75] and Pd [76] into Au/TS-1 catalysts has been reported. Between them, it was found that the gas phase epoxidation of propylene was significantly improved by the Pd-Au/TS-1 catalyst, due to the high selectivity of Pd towards the direct synthesis of H2O2 from H2 and O2 [77,78]. Recently, Hutchings et al. also reported that cuboctahedron-structured Au-Pd alloy NPs were benefit to deliver more electrons from Pd to Au atoms, and then to adsorbed O2 molecules, which had a positive effect on the production of H2O2 [79]. The synergistic effect between Pd and Au can obviously increase the generation rate of H2O2, and promote gas phase epoxidation of propylene [80]. 5 The pretreatment of Au/TS-1 catalyst It is well known that the acidic sites induced by excessive hydroxyl groups are detrimental to the selectivity of PO, which is necessary to be diminished. Kanungo et al. modified Au/TS-1 catalyst by silylation to convert the SiOH (TiOH) group into Si-O-SiR3 (Ti-O-SiR3), which enhanced the hydrophobicity of catalyst, promoting the rapid desorption of PO and preventing its ring-opening reaction [81,82]. However, diminished TiOH groups are adverse to the conversion of propylene. In order to consume SiOH selectively, Wang et al. reported a special silylation strategy using for continuous operation, which significantly improved both PO selectivity of 95.7 % and stability of 200 h [83]. Similarly, treating Au/TS-1 catalysts with alkali carbonates can also decrease their acid sites. For example, the Cs-treated Au/TS-1 catalyst used in the gas phase epoxidation of propylene exhibit much higher propene conversion (6.2 %) and selectivity to PO (86 %) than the pristine Au/TS-1 (1.9 % and 75 %) [84]. In addition, S-1/TS-1 catalyst with mesoporous SiO2 shell covered part of the acid sites on the external surface of TS-1 also inhibited the side reactions and improving the PO selectivity [85]. Au species deposited by DP method usually exist in the ionic form on fresh TS-1 zeolite, which have to be activated to present in Au0 to play its catalytic role in the gas phase epoxidation of propylene [64]. Results showed that the H2 atmosphere and feed gas (H2+O2+C3H6+N2) promoted the formation of Au0, while the O2 atmosphere retained Au1+ species on Au/TS-1 catalyst. Therefore, Au/TS-1 activated in O2 or air (containing O2) shows the poor catalytic performance for epoxidation reaction [86]. Moreover, Au atoms migrate and aggregate into large particles with the increase of calcination temperature [87]. When the calcination temperature increased to 573 K and 873 K, the average Au particle size increased to 16 and 21 nm, accompanied with the decreasing selectivity of PO and the obviously increasing selectivity of propane byproduct [88]. On the contrary, Au1+ is prone to disproportionate to Au0 in the H2 atmosphere, and meanwhile, the residual Cl− is removed as HCl, resulting in the significantly improved catalytic performance [65]. In addition, Huang et al. found that (H2+C3H6) activation atmosphere was able to enhance the hydrophobicity of Au/TS-1 catalyst, promoting the adsorption of propylene and the desorption of PO [89]. 6 Conclusion In view of serious pollution problem and poor economic benefit of the chlorohydrin and hydroperoxide process to produce PO in industry, the greener, more efficient and flexible gas-phase epoxidation of propylene catalyzed by Au/TS-1 is seizing more attention. In this process, small Au particles catalyze H2 and O2 to generate H2O2, and then propylene adsorbed on the framework Ti atoms of TS-1 zeolites is oxidized to PO. This review highlighted the synthesis and modification methods to obtain Au and framework Ti active sites in Au/TS-1 catalyst, in order to improve its catalytic performance and stability. Hierarchical TS-1 zeolites with small crystal size and blocked TS-1 zeolites were all developed as the Au deposition supports, which improved the diffusion behavior of reactants and products to prevent their accumulation in micropore channels and avoid Au/TS-1 catalyst deactivation. In addition, the Au capture efficiency could be enhanced by modifying the surface of TS-1 to make it be rich in OH or NH2 groups. Alkali cations were added to the precipitation solution to balance the charges of TS-1 surface and Au species, which strengthened interaction between them. Furthermore, Au/TS-1 catalyst had to be activated in H2-containing (without O2) atmosphere to show the best catalytic performance. In spite of considerable progresses on the modification of Au/TS-1 catalysts, their catalytic performances on gas-phase epoxidation of propylene do not meet the requirements for large-scale industrial process yet (10 % propylene conversion, 90 % PO selectivity and 30 % hydrogen efficiency). There is still space for the further optimization of the Au/TS-1 catalysts, one way being the design of various hierarchical TS-1 zeolites supports. The appropriate size and abundance of mesopores that allow the uniform distribution of noble metals, the free diffusion of reactant molecules and the maintenance of stable MFI structure is essential. Specifically, the preparation process of hierarchical TS-1 support has to be further simplified for industrial application. Another way is to improve the dispersion of Au particles on TS-1 supports. The addition of promoters (alcohol et al) may be helpful. Although there is much work to do for the improvement of Au/TS-1 catalyst, the gas-phase epoxidation of propylene process already shows superiority over other techniques. With the joint efforts of researchers, this process will be promoted to industrialization in the future. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors report no declarations of interest.

        "dc:description": "The gas-phase epoxidation of propylene with H2 and O2 has been explored by a number of researchers due to its green nature. It is an environmentally more benign and more efficient alternative to existing industry processes, such as the chlorohydrin method and hydroperoxide process. As the catalyst for this reaction, Au/TS-1 plays a critical role. In this review, we aimed to disclose the correlation between Au/TS-1′s catalytic property and the synthesis/modification strategies. Reaction mechanism was firstly summarized involving the generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) catalyzed by Au particles and epoxidation reaction catalyzed by TS-1 zeolites. Subsequently, the effects of different Ti species, Au particle size, loading position and chemical state on catalytic performance were discussed. Based on this, the modified strategies of TS-1 surface property and pore structure, synthesis methods for obtaining small and highly dispersed Au particles in deposition-precipitation (DP) process were emphasized. Pretreatment of Au/TS-1 catalyst to diminish hydroxyl defects and make it active in specific atmosphere were also demonstrated.",
