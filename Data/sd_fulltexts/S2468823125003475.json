Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction is an appealing option that offers advantages of converting greenhouse gas CO2 into value-added hydrocarbon products while storing green energy. Copper (Cu) is a unique catalyst that has adequate ability for adsorption and activation of CO2, as well as important intermediate species for forming multi-carbon (C2+) products. In particular, monovalent Cu(I) is deemed to be responsible for C-C coupling to form C2+ products. However, oxidation state copper species are unstable under the CO2 electrolysis conditions, tending to be reduced along with surface reconstruction. It is therefore important to develop a robust catalyst synthesis method to enhance the stability of Cu-based catalysts. Here, we demonstrate a spray-drying method for the synthesis of carbon-supported Cu catalysts for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction. This method is scalable and cost-effective, allowing one to realize mass production of carbon-supported Cu catalysts. A catalyst sample thus synthesized exhibits a Faraday efficiency of C2 products (e.g., ethylene, ethanol and acetic acid) as high as 85.8 %. In-situ attenuated total reflection-surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy characterization results reveal that the porous carbon support stabilizes Cu2O/CuO nanoparticles, facilitate CO2 adsorption, enrich local important intermediates for the C-C coupling reaction.

Introduction The electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO2RR) powered by renewable electricity to covert CO2 into value-added hydrocarbon products offers an industrially viable approach to utilizing carbon resources to achieve the net-zero emissions goal while storing green electricity in chemical bonds [1–3]. Copper (Cu) is a unique catalyst that has high ability to electrocatalytically activate CO2 [4–6] and adequate binding strength with important adsorbed intermediate species, such as *CO and *OCCOH, to promote the formation of multi-carbon (C2+) products [7,8], among which C2 products (e.g., ethanol and ethylene) are highly demanded in the market [9]. Oxide-derived Cu (OD-Cu) has been shown to be the most promising Cu catalyst for the eCO2RR [10,11]. In OD-Cu catalysts, Cu(I) is deemed to be indispensable in facilitating the C-C coupling reaction to form C2+ products [12–15]. However, Cu(I) can be readily reduced under the eCO2RR cathodic potentials [16]. In addition, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is inevitable in the eCO2RR process [17]. It is thus important to develop a robust catalyst preparation method to maintain the stability of Cu(I) while minimizing the HER. Studies have shown that Cu catalysts supported on carbon materials display advantages over OD-Cu in the eCO2RR [18–20]. In this context, carbon has several advantages. First, carbon can help maintain the stability of Cu(I) [21]. Second, carbon can effectively inhibit the HER through the hydrogen spillover effect [22]. Third, the strong interactions between carbon and Cu particles minimize catalyst particles agglomeration or dissolution in aqueous electrolytes. Fourth, carbon enhances the electron conductivity of Cu-based electrodes [23,24]. Fifth, carbon materials have a porous structure with rich surface chemistry and nanoconfinement effect [21,25], confining important intermediate species to facilitate C-C coupling [26]. Porous carbon [27], graphene [28,29], nitrogen-doped carbon (N-C) [30,31], carbon nanotube (CNT) [17,32] and activated carbon [33] have been used as Cu catalyst supports for the eCO2RR. The preparation of such carbon-supported Cu catalysts is generally complex, involving several steps. Here, we show the spray-drying method for the synthesis of carbon-supported Cu-based catalysts for the eCO2RR. The method is based on dissolving cellulose (carbon source) in a Schweitzer solution (Cu source) [34], followed by spray drying and calcination in a muffle furnace. Experimental results show that when the catalyst is calcined for 3 h, the mass ratio of CuxO/C is sufficient to ensure effective mass transport while delivering a FE of C2 products of up to 85.8 % at a cathodic potential of -1.03 V vs. RHE. In-situ attenuated total reflection-surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) characterization results demonstrate that the surface coverage of adsorbed species *COO⁻ and *CO is maintained constantly stable throughout 3 h reaction, enabling the C-C coupling reaction to form C2 products. In-situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) results show that the carbon matrix plays a crucial role in enhancing the local pH and stabilizing Cu(I) species, thereby improving the C-C coupling efficiency. This catalyst synthesis method provides a generic approach to preparing carbon-supported catalysts for the eCO2RR. Experimental section Preparation of catalyst samples The carbon-supported Cu catalysts studied in this work were prepared using the spray drying method. In brief, 25 mL of 10 wt.% NaOH solution was added into 100 mL of 7 wt.% copper sulfate (CuSO4) solution under continuous stirring to obtain copper hydroxide precipitates, which were separated by centrifugation and washed with distilled water several times to remove residual ions. The cake was subsequently dissolved in 150 mL of concentrated ammonia aqueous solution. The blue supernatant was utilized to dissolve 1.5 g of cellulose at room temperature for 2 h to obtain a cellulose cuprammonium solution. Then, a laboratory-scale spray dryer (SP-1500, Fig. S1) was used to prepare the catalysts with a peristaltic pump at a speed of 15 rpm and temperature of 180 °C. The solids were then thermally treated in air at 180 °C for 1 h, 3 h and 5 h to obtain samples designated as CuxO@C-1, CuxO@C-3, and CuxO@C-5, respectively. The molar ratio of Cu/C added during the catalyst preparation was calculated to be 0.558:1. To further investigate the effect of the ratio of Cu/C on catalyst performance toward the eCO2RR, the molar ratio of Cu/C was varied to be 0.14:1, 0.28:1 and 1:1 with Cu loadings of 0.25, 0.5 and 1.8 times of that of the CuxO@C catalysts were synthesized as described above with 3 h thermal treatment at 180 °C. These samples are designated as CuxO@C-0.25, CuxO@C-0.5 and CuxO@C-1.8, respectively. To verify the role of carbon in the catalyst, we synthesized a carbon-free catalyst as described below. 25 mL of 10 wt.% NaOH solution was added to 100 mL 7 wt.% CuSO4 solution dropwise to obtain precipitates, which were collected by centrifugation followed by washing with deionized water three times. The precipitates were then dissolved in 150 mL of concentrated ammonia aqueous solution till complete dissolving of the precipitates under stirring. The solution was spray dried to obtain solid particles, which were then thermally treated at 180 °C for 3 h to obtain a sample designated as CuxO-3. Characterization of samples X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Rigaku-Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα Radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm) at a scanning step of 0.02 °. The morphology and microstructure of the samples were characterized using the field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JSM-7800 F) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2100 Plus) techniques. The pore structure of the catalysts was characterized on a Quantachrome Autosorb-IQ-MP/XR equipment. The specific surface area of a sample was calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method while the pore size distribution was computed using the non-local density function theory (NLDFT) method from the adsorption data. The surface composition and valence state of the samples were determined on a PHI5000 Versa Probe III X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with an X-ray source of Al Kα (λ = 1486.6 eV). Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a VeraProbe III TGA-2 Thermo-gravimetric Analyzer in air at 10 °C/min. In-situ ATR-SEIRAS measurement was performed on a iS50 FT-IR as described in a previous work (Fig. S2) [15]. In-situ SERS spectra were obtained using a customized Raman cell and a 785 nm laser (Renishaw inVia) (Fig. S3). The electrode was prepared as described below. 4 mg of a catalyst, 400 µL of ethanol, 400 µL of water and 30 µL of Nafion solution were mixed followed by ultrasonic treatment. Then, 200 µL of the mixture was coated on a commercial gas diffusion electrode (GDE) (1.5 cm × 1.5 cm, SGL-29BC) purchased from Fuel Cell Store. A carbon rod was used as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were measured in argon-saturated and carbon dioxide-saturated 2 M KOH electrolyte solutions with potentials ranging from 0 to -1.95 V vs. RHE. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) data were recorded in the non-Faraday potential region using different scan rates from 20 to 100 mV s -1. Measurement of electrocatalytic properties 1 mg of a catalyst sample was added to a solution consisting of 250 µL of deionized water, 250 µL of anhydrous ethanol and 10 µL of Nafion solution to form a well-dispersed suspension. The GDE was cut into a desirable dimension (1.25 cm × 1.25 cm, the reaction area is 1.0 cm × 1.0 cm), on which 200 μL of the above-prepared suspension (slurry-like) was applied using a pipette gun. The catalyst-coated GDE was dried under an infrared light. A platinum sheet was used as the counter electrode while Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode. An online gas chromatograph (Fuli, GC9790 Plus) equipped with one thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and two flame ionization detectors (FID) was used to analyze the gaseous products of the eCO2RR. Liquid products were quantitatively analyzed by using the 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) technique (AVANCE NEO 400). The reaction was conducted in a flow cell (Fig. S4) with a CO2 flow rate of 20 mL/min. The electrolyte was 2 M NaOH solution and an FAA-3-PK-130 anion exchange membrane was used. Results and discussion Characterization of catalyst samples The XRD results shown in Fig. 1 a confirm the presence of both Cu2O (PDF #78-2076) and CuO (PDF #72-0629) phases in the samples. No metallic Cu phase was detected from the XRD patterns. However, the Cu LMM spectra of the three samples depicted in Fig. 1b show two distinct peaks at 916.4 eV and 918.9 eV, corresponding to Cu(I) and Cu(0), respectively [35,36]. Fig. S5 shows the deconvoluted Cu 2p XPS spectra, the two peaks at 933.2 eV and 952.9 eV are attributed to the spin-orbit components 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of Cu(0) and Cu(I), respectively. The two peaks at 934.9 eV and 954.5 eV are assigned to Cu(II) [37,38]. The peak at 913.2 eV corresponds to the satellite peaks produced by different transition states in the Cu LMM spectrum [39]. The XPS results indicate that Cu(0), Cu(I) and Cu(II) are present in the catalysts. Figs. 1c, d and S6a and S6e show the FESEM images of CuxO@C-1, CuxO@C-3, and CuxO@C-5. All three samples exhibit a wrinkled morphology with abundant edges. The TEM images in Figs. 1e, S6b, and S6f further demonstrate the corrugated flake-like structures containing plenty of stacking voids, which may be created during the spray drying process. The high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) images shown in Figs. 1f, S6c, and S6g confirm lattice spacings of 0.24 nm and 0.27 nm, corresponding to the (111) plane of Cu2O and the (110) plane of CuO, respectively, further confirming the presence of Cu(I) and Cu(II) in the samples, which is consistent with the XRD results. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) results in Figs. 1g, S6d and S6h show the presence of Cu, O, and C elements, indicating a uniform distribution of Cu species in on the carbon support. TGA analysis reveals that the mass CuxO/C ratios for CuxO@C-1, CuxO@C-3, and CuxO@C-5 are 2.23, 5.13, and 9.53, respectively (Fig. S7). The results indicate that although the same Cu/C ratio was used during synthesis, the actual Cu/C ratio in the catalyst still varies with different thermal treatment durations. Fig. S8 displays the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and NLDFT pore size distribution curves for CuxO@C-1, CuxO@C-3, and CuxO@C-5. The presence of hysteresis seen from all samples indicates the existence of mesopores. The corresponding pore volumes and BET specific surface areas are summarized in Table S1. Among the three catalysts, CuxO@C-3 demonstrates the largest pore volume of 0.108 (micropore volume) and 0.064 (mesopore volume) cm3 g-1 and the highest BET surface area of 38.9 m2 g-1 with substantial mesopores. This unique porous structure is crucial for enhancing mass transport in the GDE for enhancing the overall performance of the catalyst in the eCO2RR [17,40]. The contact angle measurements of CuxO@C-1, CuxO@C-3, and CuxO@C-5 show that CuxO@C-3 has a contact angle of 131.2 °, which is larger than that of CuxO@C-1 (115.3 °) and CuxO@C-5 (126.5 °). (Fig. S9) This indicates better hydrophobicity, which is favorable for multi-carbon product formation [41]. Electrochemical performance in the eCO2RR Figs. 2 a-c illustrate the FEs of both gaseous and liquid products as a function of applied cathodic potential. It can be seen that the FE for H2 (FEH2 ) for the three catalysts is all below 20 % with CuxO@C-3 exhibiting the lowest FEH2 (9.4 %) at -1.03 V vs. RHE. LSV results (Fig. S10) show that CuxO@C-3 has the smallest current density under an Ar-atmosphere, indicating its best ability to suppress the HER. Catalyst CuxO@C-1 exhibits the highest FE of CH4 (FECH4 ), which increases with the applied cathodic potential (Fig. 2a). Catalyst CuxO@C-5 achieves the highest FE of CO (FECO), peaked at -1.06 V vs. RHE (Fig. 2c). The FE of C2H4 (FEC2H4 ) and C2 ( FE C 2 ), along with the FE ratio of FE C 2 /FEC1 are shown in Figs. 2d-f, wherein C2 includes C2H4, acetic acid (CH3COOH) and ethanol (CH3CH2OH) while C1 includes carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), formic acid (HCOOH) and methanol (CH3OH). CuxO@C-3 achieves the highest FEC2H4 (42.5 %), surpassing both CuxO@C-1 (37.6 %) and CuxO@C-5 (36.8 %). Moreover, the FE C 2 for CuxO@C-3 reaches an impressive level of 85.8 % at the cathodic potential of -1.03 V vs. RHE and the current density of 164 mA cm-2 (Fig. 2e). Fig. 2f shows that CuxO@C-3 has the highest FE C 2 /FEC1 of 10.6 at -1.25 V vs. RHE, in sharp contrast with CuxO@C-1 at -1.05 V vs. RHE (7.79) and CuxO@C-5 at -1.56 V vs. RHE (6.06). These results unequivocally demonstrate that CuxO@C-3 outperforms the other two catalysts in terms of both catalytic activity and C2 selectivity in the eCO2RR, outperforming many carbon-supported Cu catalysts reported in the literature [19,20,42]. CuxO@C-1, CuxO@C-3, and CuxO@C-5 were tested at a current density of 160 mA cm-2 for 30 min, after which the catalysts were characterized using XRD, XPS and SEM and compared with their pre-test counterparts. As shown in Fig. S11, the used CuxO@C catalysts were reduced to Cu and Cu2O after eCO2RR. The post-reaction Cu LMM Auger spectrum (Fig. S12) also confirms the presence of Cu(I) even after 30 min of reaction, indicating that Cu2O remains stable throughout the 30-min reaction. By comparing the peak areas of Cu(I) and Cu(0) for the three samples, their Cu(I):Cu(0) ratios were determined to be 0.94, 1.39, and 0.73, respectively. These results indicate that only an appropriate carbon content can maximize the preservation of Cu(I), while excessively high or low carbon content leads to the reduction of Cu(I). The FESEM images of the catalysts after 30-min reaction are shown Fig. S13. In comparison with the images of the catalysts before reaction (Figs. 1c, d, S6a, and S6e), CuxO@C-1 and CuxO@C-5 exhibit a sheet-like structure with numerous nanoparticles attached to the surface, while CuxO@C-3 presents a honeycomb-like structure, it appears the morphology of the catalysts changed, indicating surface restructuring occurred [43]. To further investigate the effect of the Cu/C ratio on eCO2RR performance, we varied the Cu/C ratio in the catalyst synthesis. Fig. S14 presents the FESEM and TEM images of catalysts with different Cu/C ratios. As the Cu content increases, the catalyst morphology transitions from spherical to wrinkled sheet-like structures (Figs. S14a, c, e), while the exposed crystal facets undergo continuous changes (Figs. S14b, d, f). This indicates that the interaction between Cu and C can influence the preferential growth orientation of CuxO particles. TGA results reveal that the CuxO/C mass ratios for CuxO@C-0.25, CuxO@C-0.5, and CuxO@C-1.8 are 0.67, 1.22, and 9, respectively (Fig. S15). eCO2RR performance tests reveal that although the catalytic activity improves with increasing Cu content, excessive Cu does not further enhance performance. Instead, the reduced relative carbon content weakens its protective effect on Cu(I), thereby leading to a decrease in FE C 2 (Fig. S16). Fig. S17 shows the Cu LMM Auger spectra of CuxO@C-0.25, CuxO@C-0.5, and CuxO@C-1.8 before and after the reaction. It can be seen that the ability to preserve Cu(I) gradually weakens among the three samples. For CuxO@C-1.8, the Cu(I):Cu(0) ratio decreases from 1 to 0.72 after the reaction, indicating that a lower carbon content provides less protection for Cu(I). Although CuxO@C-0.25 and CuxO@C-0.5 exhibit stronger stabilization of Cu(I), their FE C 2 values are relatively low, likely due to the excessive carbon content hindering mass transport. Fig. S18 shows the electrocatalytic performance of CuxO-3 in the eCO2RR, which was prepared without the presence of carbon. It can be seen that a significant increase in FECO is observed from CuxO-3 in comparison with CuxO@C-3. This highlights the critical role of carbon in tuning the product selectivity and facilitating the C-C coupling. Studies have shown that Cu(I) species plays a pivotal role in facilitating the C-C coupling reaction to form C2 products [19,20,44]. We believe that the porous carbon support help stabilize the Cu(I) via strong interactions between Cu2O and carbon matrix during the eCO2RR [20]. Additionally, the porous carbon structure facilitates the CO adsorption and confinement to enable the continuous C-C coupling to increase the C2 products selectivity [19,25]. Furthermore, the carbon support enhances electron conductivity to accelerate the adsorption of CO2 and concerted proton-electron transfer (CPET) reaction (*CO2 + e- + H+ → *COOH) [45]. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the catalysts was estimated by calculating the capacitance of the electric double layer (Cedl) using the CV data recorded in the non-Faradaic potential region (Figs. S19a-c). Among the catalysts, CuxO@C-3 exhibits the highest Cedl value of 3.45 mF cm-2, which is significantly larger than that of CuxO@C-1 (2.60 mF cm-2) and CuxO@C-5 (2.66 mF cm-2) (Figs. S19d-f). These results suggest that CuxO@C-3 possesses more catalytically active sites compared to the other two catalysts, proving its superior performance in the eCO2RR. Fig. 2g illustrates the variation in current density and FE C 2 as a function of reaction time over catalyst CuxO@C-3 at an applied cathodic potential of -1.03 V vs. RHE. The current density shows a gradual decline over reaction time, indicating a reduction in catalyst activity. Despite this, the FE C 2 remains above 80 % during the initial 10 h of reaction and above 60 % after 22 h, demonstrating a good stability under the experimental conditions. A comparative analysis of the maximum values for FEC2H4 , FE C 2 , FE C 2 /FEC1 , J total (I/S, I = reaction current, S = reaction area) and J C2 ( FE C 2 × J total) for catalysts CuxO@C-1, CuxO@C-3, and CuxO@C-5 shown in Fig. 2h highlights the superior performance of CuxO@C-3. Although the maximum J C2 of CuxO@C-3 (140.67 mA cm-2) is higher than that of CuxO@C-1 (91.13 mA cm-2) and CuxO@C-5 (88.43 mA cm-2), the ECSA-normalized partial current density for C2 products was estimated using J C2 /Ce dl to exclude external factors. The ECSA-normalized partial current density for C2 products of CuxO@C-3 is 40.77 mA cm-2, which is higher than that of CuxO@C-1 (35.05 mA cm-2) and CuxO@C-5 (33.24 mA cm-2), indicating that CuxO@C-3 exhibits the highest intrinsic activity for C2 product formation. In-situ ATR-SEIRAS results Fig. 3 a-c display the in-situ ATR-SEIRAS spectra for CuxO@C-1, CuxO@C-3, and CuxO@C-5 at various cathodic potentials. All three catalysts exhibit a prominent peak at 1650 cm-1, which is attributed to the H-O-H vibration of interfacial H2O [46]. The peak intensity increases with increasing cathodic potential, suggesting that the adsorption and activation of H2O are enhanced by the applied potential. Fig. 3d shows that the intensity of the *COO⁻ species at around 1420 cm-1 [47–49] (Let the highest point of the peak be G1 and the lowest point be G2, and the peak intensity is calculated as ΔG = G1 - G2. This calculation applies to all peaks.), which is formed via the CPET reaction [49–51], follows CuxO@C-3 > CuxO@C-5 > CuxO@C-1 after -0.5 V vs. RHE. Furthermore, as the potential increases, the *COO⁻ intermediate for CuxO@C-1 and CuxO@C-5 appears at -0.6 V vs. RHE, indicating that CuxO@C-3 has a stronger CO2 activation ability, as it can generate the *COO⁻ intermediate at a lower potential. The fast occurrence and transformation of *COO⁻ indicate the higher activity of catalyst CuxO@C-3 in activating CO2 than that of catalysts CuxO@C-1 and CuxO@C-5. The concurrent adsorption and activation of H2O and CO2 molecules indicate an efficient coupling between H2O dissociation and CO2 reduction, which effectively suppresses HER [52], as proven by the low FEH2 values (Figs. 2a-c). The activated *CO2 and surface *H species facilitate the formation of *CO via the CPET reaction [52], as is confirmed by the *COatop peaks observed from Figs. 3a-c. For the three catalysts, species *COatop seen from the range between 2000 and 2100 cm-1 [48,53] is observed exclusively between cathodic potentials -0.3 and -1.4 V vs. RHE. The *COatop peak shifted to 2034 cm-1 with increasing potential, which is due to the Stark tuning effect [54]. The intensity of the *COatop peak for CuxO@C-3 is significantly stronger than that for CuxO@C-1 and CuxO@C-5 (Fig. 3e). This suggests that higher CO coverage on CuxO@C-3, which effectively promotes the subsequent C-C coupling to form C2+ products. Fig. 3f illustrates the potential dependence of the intensity of specie *OCCOH (1285 cm-1) [7] for CuxO@C-1, CuxO@C-3, and CuxO@C-5. It can be seen that the *OCCOH signal for CuxO@C-1 appears at -0.6 V vs. RHE, which is later than that for CuxO@C-3 (-0.4 V vs. RHE) and CuxO@C-5 (-0.5 V vs. RHE). Meanwhile, the *OCCOH signal for CuxO@C-1 decreases gradually after reaching its peak at -0.6 V vs. RHE, while those for CuxO@C-3 and CuxO@C-5 remain stable. CuxO@C-3 exhibited the lowest potential for the *OCCOH signal, indicating the lowest energy barrier for C-C coupling. This suggests that the activation energy for multi-carbon product formation is relatively low, which contributes to the long-term stability of the catalyst layer in producing C2 products. (Fig. 2g) [55]. And, the *COatop signal intensity for CuxO@C-3 is significantly higher than that for CuxO@C-5, enabling it to provide more C-C coupling precursors, thus exhibiting a stronger ability to generate C2+ products. This also supports the observation that CuxO@C-3 has the highest FE C 2 (85.8 %) at -1.03 V vs. RHE among the three catalysts. In-situ SERS results Fig. 4 presents the in-situ SERS spectra of the CuxO@C-1, CuxO@C-3, and CuxO@C-5 catalysts. The assignment of important Raman shifts is summarized in Table 1 . Figs. 4a, c, and e show that the Cu(I) signal, characterized by the peak at 626 cm-1 (denoted as Cu2O) [56,57], appears within the cathodic potential range between -0.5 and -1.4 V vs. RHE, and does not disappear with increasing potential, indicating the stable presence of Cu(I) during the eCO2RR process [14]. However, studies on OD-Cu catalysts also suggest that under typical eCO2RR conditions, unprotected oxidized Cu species can easily be reduced to Cu(0) [58]. Observations of Cu(I) from the three catalysts synthesized in this work indicate that carbon plays a role in stabilizing the Cu(I) species. The peak at approximately 520 cm-1 corresponds to *CO2 (O-C-O vibration) [59]. As the applied potential increases, the *CO2 peak for the CuxO@C-3 catalyst becomes increasingly prominent compared to that of CuxO@C-1 and CuxO@C-5. This indicates that CuxO@C-3 has a higher surface CO2 concentration compared to the other two catalysts. Its moderate carbon content not only stabilizes Cu(I) but also avoids hindering mass transport, enabling efficient delivery and adsorption of a large amount of CO2 onto the catalyst surface within a given reaction period. Meanwhile, the porous structure of CuxO@C-3 facilitates the accumulation of OH⁻ anions, thereby increasing the local OH⁻ concentration. This is reflected by the enhanced intensity of the Cu-OH peak at 460 cm-1 [60–62], which promotes the C-C coupling reaction (Fig. S20a) [67]. In contrast, CuxO@C-1 and CuxO@C-5 demonstrate a significant increase in OH⁻ coverage only at higher potentials. This can be attributed to the much smaller pore volume and specific surface area of CuxO@C-1 and CuxO@C-5 compared to CuxO@C-3 (Table S1), which leads to low concentration of OH⁻ at low cathodic potentials. This high pore volume-to-surface area ratio altered the local H2O and CO2 concentrations on the CuxO@C-3 surface, enabling efficient eCO2RR (Fig. 2b) [68]. The peak around 720 cm-1 is attributed to C=O bending vibration of δCOO⁻ species [59], while the one near 1570 cm-1 corresponds to C=O asymmetric stretching vibration of νasCOO⁻ species [59,63]. Fig. 4 shows that *COO⁻ species emerge at approximately -0.7 V vs. RHE for CuxO@C-3 and CuxO@C-5, whereas for CuxO@C-1, it is observed at around -0.9 V vs. RHE. This suggests that CuxO@C-3 and CuxO@C-5 possess a stronger CO2 activation capability than CuxO@C-1. Additionally, the *COr signal, corresponding to the restricted rotational vibration of Cu-CO near 310 cm-1, and the *COs signal, associated with the stretching vibration of Cu-CO at approximately 375 cm-1 [64,65], emerge sequentially under different cathodic potentials. The relative surface coverage of *CO (*COcoverage) can be determined from the intensity ratio of *COs/*COr [69]. Fig. S20b illustrates the variation in the *COs/*COr ratio for the CuxO@C-1, CuxO@C-3, and CuxO@C-5 catalysts under different cathodic potentials. For CuxO@C-1, the ratio shows a slight initial increase before stabilizing across the potential range. In contrast, the ratio for CuxO@C-3 remains stable at lower potentials, then increases sharply as the potential approaches -1 V vs. RHE, reaching a maximum at this point. This behavior aligns with the observation that CuxO@C-3 achieves its highest FE C 2 value at -1.03 V vs. RHE. However, over cathodic potential -1 V vs. RHE, the ratio declines significantly, indicating a rapid depletion of surface *CO at higher cathodic potentials. Meanwhile, the ratio of *COs/*COr for CuxO@C-5 remains consistently low and relatively stable. The *COatop Raman signal observed from Figs. 4b, d and f comprises two distinct *CO species, namely high-frequency-band (HFB) and low-frequency-band (LFB) *COatop [65,66]. These species respectively correspond to *COatop adsorbed on the step edges and/or adatom defects and terraces of Cu catalysts, respectively [65]. It has been reported that *COHFB is more favorable for promoting C-C coupling [65]. It can be seen from Fig. S20c that the initial adsorption potentials of the three samples for *COHFB follow the order: CuxO@C-3 (-0.5 V vs. RHE) = CuxO@C-5 (-0.5 V vs. RHE) > CuxO@C-1 (-0.1 V vs. RHE). Therefore, the C-C coupling energy barrier of CuxO@C-1 is lower. However, its *CO coverage is lower (Fig. S20b), resulting in the C-C coupling rate. In contrast, the potential for C-C coupling on CuxO@C-3 is approximately -0.5 V vs. RHE. The large quantity of *CO adsorbed on its surface facilitates the eCO2RR, leading to the efficient production of C2 products. Fig. 4f show that the *CObridge signal at about 1830 cm-1 [39] is detected exclusively on the surface of catalyst CuxO@C-5. According to a recent research work [48], *CObridge is catalytically inactive in the eCO2RR. Meanwhile, the *COLFB signal of CuxO@C-5 is relatively strong. This explains the significantly lower FE C 2 for the CuxO@C-5 catalyst compared to catalysts CuxO@C-1 and CuxO@C-3. Conclusions The spray-drying method demonstrated in this study represents a robust protocol for synthesizing carbon-supported Cu catalysts with good stability and high selectivity toward C2 products. At an applied potential of -1.03 V vs. RHE, the catalyst calcined for 3 h delivers a FE C 2 of up to 85.8 %. The optimized CuxO/C ratio enables the carbon matrix to effectively stabilize Cu(I), which is considered indispensable for *CO and *COO⁻ adsorption as well as C-C coupling, thereby ensuring its sustained presence during the eCO2RR process. Meanwhile, the mesoporous carbon support facilitates mass transport for both reactants and products. In-situ ATR-SEIRAS and SERS spectroscopic characterization results reveal the advantages of the porous architecture, which not only enhances CO2 adsorption and activation but also promotes the local enrichment of important intermediate species, including CO, COO⁻ and OH⁻. The spray-drying method for synthesizing carbon-supported Cu catalyst is cost-effective and scalable, holding a great promise for mass production of industrial catalysts for CO2 electrolysis.

        "dc:description": "Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction is an appealing option that offers advantages of converting greenhouse gas CO2 into value-added hydrocarbon products while storing green energy. Copper (Cu) is a unique catalyst that has adequate ability for adsorption and activation of CO2, as well as important intermediate species for forming multi-carbon (C2+) products. In particular, monovalent Cu(I) is deemed to be responsible for C-C coupling to form C2+ products. However, oxidation state copper species are unstable under the CO2 electrolysis conditions, tending to be reduced along with surface reconstruction. It is therefore important to develop a robust catalyst synthesis method to enhance the stability of Cu-based catalysts. Here, we demonstrate a spray-drying method for the synthesis of carbon-supported Cu catalysts for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction. This method is scalable and cost-effective, allowing one to realize mass production of carbon-supported Cu catalysts. A catalyst sample thus synthesized exhibits a Faraday efficiency of C2 products (e.g., ethylene, ethanol and acetic acid) as high as 85.8 %. In-situ attenuated total reflection-surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy characterization results reveal that the porous carbon support stabilizes Cu2O/CuO nanoparticles, facilitate CO2 adsorption, enrich local important intermediates for the C-C coupling reaction.",
