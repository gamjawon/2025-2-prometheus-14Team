The hydrogen form of the zeolite was prepared by ion-exchange of the sodium ions of the disc-shaped pellet for hydrogen ions in hydrochloric acid solution. The catalyst thus prepared was characterized by SEM, thermogravimetry, nitrogen adsorption and ammonia TPD. High para- xylene selectivity was observed for the new, disc-shaped ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst in the alkylation of toluene with methanol. This feature was attributed to the inherent character of the catalyst, since its structure consisted of intergrown individual HZSM-5 crystals forming secondary mesopores. This structural arrangement led to a substantial decrease in the outer surface between the adjacent crystals, the probability of secondary reactions therefore being suppressed.

Introduction Zeolites and zeolite-like microporous materials are widely used as catalysts both in the petrochemical industries and in the production of fine chemicals. Since Breck described the possibility of the synthesis of zeolite A from kaolin extrudates by hydrothermal treatment, considerable effort has been invested in the preparation of binderless preformulated zeolites via solid-state reactions [1]. Natural ores of volcanic origin have been used as raw materials for the synthesis of self-bonded * Corresponding author. 0926-860X/97/$17.00 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The successful synthesis of various zeolites has been described from zeolite extrudates [5,6]. Aluminium silicate gel with low water content has been transformed into zeolite A by a solid-state rearrangement [7]. Amorphous sodium-aluminium silicates have been brought into contact with the vapor of organic materials and water in an autoclave, and transformed to zeolites [8-10]. Via similar methods, amorphous materials have been converted to zeolites in a nonaqueous system in the presence of excess ammonium compounds [ 11,12]. It has been shown that self-supported zeolite pellets with high mechanical strength can be prepared from very dense gels containing no organic materials [ 13]. TS-1 and TS-2 have been successfully synthesized from xerogel through solid- solid transformations [14]. A Japanese group recently developed a new zeolite synthesis method for the preparation of ZSM-5-type materials [16]. In this procedure, ZSM-5-type zeolites are prepared via the solid-state transformation of kanemite-aluminium silicate mixtures pressed into disc-shaped pellets. As the above literature overview reveals, several methods are available for the preparation of binderless preformulated zeolites. In spite of this, zeolite pellets prepared through solid-state reactions have not yet been applied as catalysts. For successful catalytic application, such pellets should have an appropriate pore structure and a high permeability towards the reactants and the products, in order to minimize the technical difficulties resulting from the application of high pressure. The material prepared in our laboratories fulfills these demands. In this paper we report on the successful application of these preformulated materials as shape- selective catalysts. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials, synthesis NaZSM-5 zeolite was prepared via the solid-state transformation of kanemite- aluminium silicate mixtures. Kanemite (NaHSi2Os-2H20) was prepared by the method given in [15]. Sodium hydroxide was added to a water-glass solution so as to adjust the SiO2/NaOH ratio to 1.0. The solution was dried and finally calcined at 973 K for 6 h. The product was immersed in water. Kanemite was recovered by filtration, followed by drying at room temperature. Kanemite-TPA (tetrapropyl- ammonium) gel was prepared by mixing kanemite in an aqueous solution of tetrapropylammonium bromide at 343 K, and adjusting the pH of the mixture to 8.5 with hydrochloric acid solution. Kanemite-TPA powder was obtained by drying the gel. SiO2-A1203 powder was prepared by the typical sol-gel method. A monolithic gel was obtained by hydrolysis of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and aluminium I. Kiricsi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 156 (1997) 335-345 337 tri-sec-butoxide (ATB) with an aqueous solution of tetrapropylammonium hydro- xide (TPAOH) at 343-353 K. After aging for 12-16 h, silica-alumina powder was obtained by drying at room temperature under vacuum. The kanemite-TPA - silica-alumina mixture was prepared by kneading the components, followed by pressing into disc-shaped pellets (diameter 13 mm, thickness 1.5 mm) at 423 K in closed glass ampoules for 69 h. The ampoules were then opened and heat treatment was continued at 573 K in air for 2 h, followed by burning the template off by calcination at 773 K for 22 h. No dimensional change was detected for the discs in consequence of crystallization and calcination. The template-free discs had excellent mechanical strength for sample handling and the pretreatment usual for zeolite catalyst preparation. Further details on preparation conditions and the XRD characterization are given elsewhere [16]. The disc-shaped NaZSM-5 (Si/AI=50) was ion-exchanged in 0.1 M HCI solution, washed with distilled water to remove CI-, dried and dehydrated at 523 K. These dehydrated discs were kept in a dry box in order to avoid rehydration, which would hamper the preparation of the catalyst bed. The disc-shaped zeolite pellet catalyst prepared in this way is denoted as DSZP. In order to compare the catalytic activities of DSZP and HZSM-5 zeolite powder (ZP) with identical Si/A1 (=50) ratio, ZP was prepared by the conventional hydrothermal method and used in powder form in the reactor. From the ZP sample, pellets were pressed and then crushed. The 12-20 mesh sieve fraction was used as second reference sample. These crushed tablets pressed from HZSM-5 powder is referred as CTPP below. Some of the DSZP pellets were crushed and sieved and the 12-20 mesh fraction was selected. The catalytic activity of this crushed disc-shaped zeolite pellet (CDSZP) was also investigated. 3. Characterization Samples were characterized by different physical methods. The nitrogen iso- therms for determination of BET area and/or the maximal adsorbed volume of nitrogen were measured at 77 K with the BELSORP36 (BEL Japan) equipment. Samples were pretreated in two different ways: (i) identical to that for the reactor experiments, (ii) in vacuum at 473 and 673 K for the investigation of spent catalyst samples. Mass losses of catalyst samples were measured derivatographically, using a computer-controlled MAC Science TG-DTA 2000 machine. Measurements were carded out both in air and in a nitrogen flow. For SEM measurements, a HITACHI S 800 scanning electron microscope was used. Pt coverage was applied to make the samples conductors. Images were taken of differently oriented samples. 338 L Kiricsi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 156 (1997) 335-345 Acidities of samples were determined by ammonia TPD, utilizing a heatable and evacuable microbalance working under computer control. The samples were pretreated in vacuum at 723 K, followed by cooling to room temperature, and ammonia was adsorbed. From the mass changes, the quantity of adsorbed ammonia can be calculated. Desorption of ammonia was monitored at a heating rate of 10 K/ min. Blank experiments were performed in order to determine the equipment constant. 4. Reactor construction, reaction parameters Reactions were carried out in a fixed-bed, down-flow reactor. The catalysts (100 mg, 12-20 mesh particle size) were placed into a quartz tube with an i.d. 10 mm and were activated at 723 K in an oxygen flow for 4 h, followed by purging in nitrogen for 2 h. In the investigations, nitrogen was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of l0 ml/min. A technical problem relating to the disc-shaped catalyst, namely the fastening of the disc into the reactor tube, first had to be solved. In this case, the reactor tube was made from glass. In order to exclude any leakage and to force reactants to pass through the zeolite disc, various reactor designs attempting to satisfy these requirements were tested, such as (i) gluing the disc-shape pellet into a bottleneck-shaped glass tube by sealing with molten low melting point glass. Here, upon cooling, the glue was broken. This formed fine gaps, allowing the gas to bypass the zeolite disc at the wall of the tube, and the low melting point glass diffused into the pores of the disc during the first several heating-cooling steps, causing a gradually lower gas permeability of the disc-shaped zeolite. (ii) Similar difficulties arose when we sealed the zeolite disc onto a perforated glass plate with low melting point glass. (iii) The applicable solution ensuring that the reactants pass through the disc involved direct sealing of the zeolite disc into the glass tube. The disc was placed in a bottleneck-shaped glass tube, and the region around the pellet was then heated slowly up to the melting point of the glass and kept there until the sealing had proceeded. After sealing, the in situ sealed catalyst was cooled very slowly to ambient temperature followed by the connection of some additional reactor part to it. As a result of this technology, a \"catalyst bed\" of appropriate mechanical strength without holes or gaps was made in a reproducible way. The alkylation of toluene with methanol was used as catalytic test reaction. The effects of reactor temperature (Tr=623, 673 and 723 K), reactant composition (toluene/methanol molar ratio=3(3.03), 2(1.89) and 1(0.96)), and feeding rate (WHSV=8.5, 17 and 34 gfeed/gcat h) on the catalytic activity were investigated for the different catalysts discussed above. The reactant mixture was introduced into the reactor by using a HPLC pump (Nihon Seimitsu Kagaku, Japan). Products were collected by trapping for 3 h and I. Kiricsi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 156 (1997) 335-345 339 were analyzed by means of a GC (Shimadzu) equipped with two columns (2 m long, packed with 20% PEG on Chromosorb W or Porapack QP). 5. Results Nitrogen adsorption isotherms of fresh DSZP and ZP are to be seen in Fig. 1. The adsorption-desorption hysteresis loop characteristic of porous systems is longer for the DSZP than for the ZP sample, although both are well-crystallized HZSM-5 zeolites. The BET areas and the volumes of adsorbed nitrogen are listed in Table 1. These data show that DSZP has a smaller BET value than ZP, which can be explained by the difference in the structures of the samples. V/cma(STP)g\"1 200 ads. des. O __ m D 150 ,~ A .,~,~..~.

For comparison, the picture of the ZP sample can also be seen. The structural difference between the DSZP and ZP samples is marked. From the ammonia thermodesorption measurements, it was found that the catalysts DSZP and ZP contain strong (desorption temperatures 654 and 681 K) and weak (desorption temperatures 474 and 499 K) acid sites in almost identical concentrations, as shown in Fig. 3. While the methanol conversion was 100% for each catalytic run, the toluene conversion increased as the toluene/methanol ratio of the feed decreased (see Fig. 4). These data reveal that the concentration ofpara-xylene was the largest for both ZP and DSZP catalysts. Independent of the feed composition, however, the concentration of para-xylene was higher for the DSZP sample than for ZP. Toluene conversion and xylene selectivities obtained at different temperatures over the DSZP catalyst are given in Table 2. With increasing reaction temperature, both the toluene conversion and the selectivity of para-xylene increased. The results obtained for various types of catalyst under identical experimental condi- tions evidenced that the para-selectivity was the highest for the DSZP catalyst. Table 3 lists our data and also selectivity data published for nonmodified HZSM- 5 catalysts by other groups. The para-xylene selectivity over the HZSM-5 zeolite exceeds that of the new disc-shaped catalyst only when the catalyst consists of large crystals. The para-xylene selectivity proved to be much higher for each catalyst than predicted from the thermodynamic equilibrium. These experimental results suggest that the solid-state-synthesized (DSZP) material possesses an enhanced shape-selective character. We tested the reactions of methanol and the transformation of toluene in separate experiments. As expected, hydrocarbons were formed from methanol, but the methanol conversion was low even at 673 K. The toluene conversion was lower than 5% in those experiments in which pure toluene was tested. In these reactions, xylene isomers and benzene were the main products. The para-selective behavior of the DSZP catalyst was proven in this case, too. I. Kiricsi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 156 (1997) 335-345 341 Fig. 2. SEM images of catalyst samples. A and B: cross-section of DSZP at different magnifications, C: surface of DSZE D: ZP particles. In order to obtain information on the aging procedure that takes place during the reaction, the characteristics of two spent catalyst samples worked under identical conditions for 3 h were investigated. Thermogravimetric analysis of the spent DSZP and ZP showed that the former contained less coke (9.4%) than the ZP (for which 12% coke was estimated by burning in air). The BET areas of these samples after evacuation at 473 and 673 K were also different (see Table 1). Comparison of 342 1.

Ammonia desorption profiles for DSZP and ZP samples. these data with those found for the fresh catalysts revealed a substantial decrease in BET area for used catalyst samples. The loss in surface area was greater for the ZP catalyst than for the DSZP sample. This feature is probably due to the larger outer surface of the ZP, which enhances the coking rate of ZSM-5 zeolite in hydrocarbon transformations. 6. Discussion Zeolites, and particularly ZSM-5-type zeolites, display different shape-selective behavior in hydrocarbon transformations, as classified by Csicsery [21]. Since the mechanism of the reaction has been discovered in most respects and described by Lercher et al. [24,25], the alkylation of toluene with methanol to produce xylenes may be applied for the characterization of the shape selectivity of microporous catalysts. The shape-selective character of ZSM-5 zeolites is strongly influenced by the particle size of the zeolite crystals, i.e. the larger the particle, the higher the selectivity of para-xylene in the toluene alkylation with methanol [22]. Predo- minantly catalytic sites on the outer surface of the zeolite crystals contribute dominantly to the decrease in concentration ofpara-xylene, which is regarded as the primary product of alkylation, and which can easily diffuse out from the zeolite crystal. To suppress the reactions proceeding in this unwanted direction, extensive 1.

The regulation of acidity by introducing various elements and compounds such as P and MgO has often been used to improve the para-xylene selectivity of ZSM-5 catalysts [ 17,18]. 344 1.

The new, disc-shaped ZSM-5 zeolite synthesized in the solid phase possesses an inherent shape-selective character which is due to its structure containing both meso and micropores. The structure formed in the synthesis has a smaller outer surface, which contributes largely to the enhanced shape-selective character of this material. The appropriate acidity combined with this unique structure is respon- sible for this special behavior. This conclusion is in accordance with the suppressed coking affinity of the DSZP catalyst.

ZSM-5 zeolite disc was synthesized by a new method in which reactions occurred in the solid state. The hydrogen form of the zeolite was prepared by ion-exchange of the sodium ions of the disc-shaped pellet for hydrogen ions in hydrochloric acid solution. The catalyst thus prepared was characterized by SEM, thermogravimetry, nitrogen adsorption and ammonia TPD. High para-xylene selectivity was observed for the new, disc-shaped ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst in the alkylation of toluene with methanol. This feature was attributed to the inherent character of the catalyst, since its structure consisted of intergrown individual HZSM-5 crystals forming secondary mesopores. This structural arrangement led to a substantial decrease in the outer surface between the adjacent crystals, the probability of secondary reactions therefore being suppressed.
