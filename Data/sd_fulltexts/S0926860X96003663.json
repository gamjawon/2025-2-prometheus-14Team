Box 110, Dalian 116023, People's Republic of China Received 11 July 1996; received in revised form 3 October 1996; accepted 4 October 1996 Abstract The effect of additive and pretreatment condition on the activity and stability of Mo/HZSM-5- based catalysts for methane non-oxidative transformation to aromatics and C2 hydrocarbons is investigated. Activity and selectivity of Mo/HZSM-5-based catalysts can be modified by the addition of a second metal component, and the catalytic performance of the catalyst is very sensitive to the atmosphere of pretreatment at high temperature. High methane conversion of over 10% and quite stable activity have been obtained at a reaction temperature of 973 K over Mo/ HZSM-5, Mo-W/HZSM-5 and Mo-Zr/HZSM-5 catalysts pretreated by air at a temperature of 873 K. Catalyst pretreatment under air atmosphere at high temperature may lead to an increase in the pore size of the catalysts and a decrease in methane conversion and activity maintenance. However, the catalysts can be stabilized if they were pretreated under an atmosphere of methane. A new Mo phase may be formed on the catalysts under methane atmosphere, which is a prerequisite for the formation of aromatics and C2 hydrocarbons.

Introduction Direct transformation of methane to more valuable hydrocarbons such as aromatics or C2 hydrocarbons is a fascinating way for reasonable utilization of natural gas resources. There are two research directions in this area: (i) methane * Corresponding author. Fax: +86-411-4694447. 0926-860X/97/$17.00 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. Pll S0926-860X(96)00366-3 174 L. Wang et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 152 (1997) 173-182 oxidative coupling to C2 hydrocarbons, (ii) methane oligomerization to aromatics. The former has been extensively studied over the past for about a decade. However, the latter one is thermodynamically more difficult, especially in the absence of oxygen. The minimum temperature for the conversion of methane pyrolytically to benzene is about 1173 K, but the temperature for obtaining 6-10 wt.% of benzene is 1480-1580 K [1]. Numerous attempts have been made to catalyze these reactions at lower and more feasible temperature. In 1966, the synthesis of aromatic hydrocarbons from methane with 4.2-7.2% aromatics yield over silica gel at 1273 K was reported [2]. In addition, methane aromatization reaction over other catalyst systems such as boron nitride (BN) [3], multifunctional multimetal oxides [1,4], high silica zeolite supported Pt-Cr catalysts [5], metal oxide and supported metal catalysts [6], high Ga-contained Pt/H-Ga-silicates [7], Mo/ HZSM-5 and Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts [8], carbonaceous materials [9] has been investigated since 1980. More recently, the effect of W additive on the catalytic activity and coking rate of Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst for methane and ethane aroma- tization has been reported [10]. Methane activation and conversion over Mo modified acidic zeolite catalyst can proceed without the need of any oxidants. Compared with methane oxidative coupling (MOC) and methane partial oxidation reactions, the advantages of the methane non-oxidative transformation process is that the selectivity to higher hydrocarbon products is high and the main product, benzene, is easier to be seperated from the methane feed. In addition, many problems causing from the side reaction such as methane complete oxidation can be avoided under non-oxidative reaction conditions. Recently, the study of methane non-oxidative transformation on Mo modified zeolite catalysts attracts more attention. An increasing number of papers on this research area have been published recently [11-16], in which characterization of catalytic and physical properties of the catalysts has been reported. However, the reported catalytic reaction results of methane over Mo-containing HZSM-5, especially the results on the activity and stability of catalysts are very different since they depend on the preparation and pretreatment conditions of the catalysts. Enhancement of the catalytic activity and stability of the catalysts is significantly important for obtaining a commercialized process for this reaction. In order to obtain a highly active and stable catalyst for the reaction, the effect of pretreatment conditions and additives on the catalytic performance of Mo/HZSM-5-based catalysts are pre- sented here. 2. Experiment 2.1. Catalyst preparation Commercially available ZSM-5 zeolite (SIO2/A1203=50) was first converted into the ammonium form (NHaZSM-5) by repeated ion exchange (4 times) with IN L. Wang et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 152 (1997) 173-182 175 NH4NO3 aqueous solution at around 368 K for I h. It was then dried at about 383 K for 4 h. HZSM-5 and Mo/HZSM-5 were prepared as described previously [8]; Mo- Zr/HZSM-5 was prepared by consecutively impregnating NHaZSM-5 with zirco- nium nitrate and ammonium heptamolybdate aqueous solution; Mo-W/HZSM-5 was prepared by co-impregnating NH4ZSM-5 with ammonium molybdate and ammonium tungstate aqueous solution; Mo-V/HZSM-5 was prepared by co- impregnating NH4ZSM-5 with ammonium molybdate and ammonium vanadate aqueous solution; Mo-La/HZSM-5 was prepared by consecutively impregnating NH4ZSM-5 with lanthanum nitrate and ammonium heptamolybdate aqueous solution. They were dried at 383 K for 4 h and calcined at 773 K for 4 h. The Mo loading of these samples is 2%. Finally, the catalysts were pressed, crushed and sorted into 20-40 mesh. 2.2. Catalytic tests Catalytic tests were carded out with about 500 mg catalyst placed in a fixed bed continuous-flow quartz reactor. The catalysts were first pretreated under air or He stream in the temperature range of 773-973 K for 30 min., then the stream was switched to methane and the reactor was brought to the reaction temperature. All the catalytic tests were performed at a pressure of 200 kPa and a methane space velocity of 1440 ml g-1 h-1. The products were withdrawn periodically from the outlet of the reactor and analyzed by an on-line Shimadzu GC-9A gas chromatography with a 2 m long Porapak Q column and a hydrogen flame ionization detector. Conversion and selectivity were calculated on the carbon number basis. 2.3. Coke deposition and BET surface area measurements Specific surface area and pore size were determined by the BET method with Micrometrics ASAP-2000 equipment using nitrogen as analysis gas. The amount of coke deposited on the catalysts was determined by TG-DTA method. 2.4. Temperature-Programmed Surface Reactions (TPSR) The experiment was performed with about 200 mg catalyst placed in a U-shape quartz reactor. Firstly, the catalyst zone was pretreated under a He stream at 873 K for 30 rain and then brought to room temperature. At room temperature, the stream was switched to methane. Temperature-programmed methane reaction was started from room temperature to 973 K at 10 K rain-1 and then held at 973 K for 30 min. The product such as CO (m/e=28), CO2 (m/e=44), C2H4 (m/e--26), C2H6 (m] e=30), C6H6 (m/e=78) was monitored with TE-150 multiple channel mass spectrometer. The reaction pressure is 34 kPa. 176 L. Wang et al./Applied Catalysis A.\" General 152 (1997) 173-182 2.5. Material Methane feed is over 99.99% pure. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Effect of additive and pretreatment atmosphere Table 1 shows the effect of additives on the reactivity of methane over Mo/ HZSM-5-based catalysts. The results in Table 1 indicate that the activity and selectivity to aromatics can be improved by the addition of Zr or W to Mo/HZSM- 5. The addition of Zr is most effective in improving the activity of catalyst at a reaction temperature of 923 K and a Zr content of 1.0%. The addition of V leads to a decrease in methane conversion and selectivity to aromatics, but the selectivity to C2 hydrocarbons is slightly increased. The effect of catalyst pretreatment atmo- sphere on the catalytic activity of Mo-Zr/HZSM-5 is summarized in Table 2. It is clear from Table 2 that the catalytic activity of Mo-ZrPrlZSM-5 can be enhanced when it is pretreated under flowing air at a temperature of 873 K. The effect of pretreatment conditions on specific surface area and pore size of the catalyst is also examined. The results are summarized in Table 3. The treatment of Mo-Zr/HZSM-5 under an air atmosphere and a high temperature of 973 K leads to a decrease in BET specific surface area and an enlargement of average pore diameter of the catalyst. The BET specific surface area and pore volume of the catalyst are also decreased with time on stream at a reaction temperature of 973 K, which result from coke deposition on the catalyst. The BET surface area and pore volume can be completely recovered after the coke is removed by combustion with air at a temperature of 773 K. Therefore, the effect of air and methane atmospheres on the specific surface area and pore volume of the catalyst is very different.

Effect of pretreatment temperature The effect of pretreatment temperature on the catalytic performance of Mo-Zr/ HZSM-5 catalyst is compared in Figs. 1-3. Mo-Zr/HZSM-5 catalysts pretreated under flowing air at 973, 923 and 873 K are described as Mo-Zr/HZ-973, Mo-Zr/ HZ-923 and Mo-Zr/HZ-873, respectively. Methane conversion and activity main- tenance are very sensitive to the pretreatment temperature of the catalyst. Mo-Zr/ HZ-873 exhibits quite high and stable activity and selectivity to aromatics with time on stream. The methane conversion is over 10% with selectivity of more than 93 % to aromatics and about 6% to C2 hydrocarbons. The amount of coke deposited on the catalysts is less than 0.25% of methane feed. The catalytic activity and stability of Mo-Zr/HZSM-5 for methane aromatization are evidently decreased with increasing pretreatment temperature of the catalyst as shown in Figs. 2 and 3. Therefore, the pretreatment conditions are crucial for obtaining highly active and stable catalyst. In order to compare Mo/HZSM-5 with Mo-Zr/HZSM-5 and Mo-W/ HZSM-5, methane conversion and selectivity to aromatics and C2 hydrocarbons as 178 L.

The formation of carbon oxides cannot be simply ascribed to the reduction of MoO3 by methane. A sharp peak of CO product is still appeared in the case of MoPrlZSM-5 catalyst after reduction under H2 stream at 973 K as shown in Fig. 7. It is suggested that Mo phase transformation takes place at the first step of methane reaction on the catalysts, which is a prerequisite of aromatics and C2 hydrocarbon formation.

Conclusions The catalytic activity and stability of Mo/HZSM-5 can be enhanced by the addition of Zr or W, and it is also very sensitive to pretreatment conditions. High methane conversion of over 10% and quite stable activity can be obtained at a reaction temperature of 973 K over the catalysts pretreated by air at a temperature of 873 K. Pretreating catalysts under air atmosphere at high temperature may lead to an increase in pore size of the catalysts and a decrease in methane conversion and activity maintenance, However, the catalyst can be stabilized under the atmosphere of methane. A new Mo phase is formed under methane atmosphere, which is a prerequisite of the formation of aromatics C2 hydrocarbons.

The effect of additive and pretreatment condition on the activity and stability of Mo HZSM-5-based catalysts for methane non-oxidative transformation to aromatics and C2 hydrocarbons is investigated. Activity and selectivity of Mo HZSM-5-based catalysts can be modified by the addition of a second metal component, and the catalytic performance of the catalyst is very sensitive to the atmosphere of pretreatment at high temperature. High methane conversion of over 10% and quite stable activity have been obtained at a reaction temperature of 973 K over Mo HZSM-5 , MoW HZSM-5 and MoZr HZSM-5 catalysts pretreated by air at a temperature of 873 K. Catalyst pretreatment under air atmosphere at high temperature may lead to an increase in the pore size of the catalysts and a decrease in methane vonversion and activity maintenance. However, the catalysts can be stabilized if they were pretreated under an atmosphere of methane. A new Mo phase may be formed on the catalysts under methane atmosphere, which is a prerequisite for the formation of aromatics and C2 hydrocarbons.
