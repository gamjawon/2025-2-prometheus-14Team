The influence of the zeolite properties on the catalytic activity and catalyst decay has been obtained. By studying the evolution of the rate constants with the number of carbon atoms in the n-alkanes it has been found that the existence of a PCP cracking mechanism would be consistent with the observed evolution. Keywords: Alkane cracking; Zeolites; Deactivation 1. Introduction It is generally accepted that the cracking of alkanes occurs through a monomolecular process involving carbonium ions and by a bimolecular process involving carbenium ions [ 1-4 ] . The quantification of both mechanisms by means of a kinetic rate equation is not a simple task, but nevertheless it becomes necessary to develop adequate kinetic models, if the influence of the nature of the catalyst and reactants on cracking behaviour has to be studied in a quantitative way. Different rate expressions have therefore been developed to fit the cracking results of alkanes on acid catalysts. The most simple one involves a first order kinetic equation [ 5-10 ] , while another more general kinetic expression considers the influence of the adsorption * Corresponding author. 0926-860X/94/$07.00 1994 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, in the case of catalytic cracking, the kinetic studies become further complicated by the fact that the catalyst decays very fast, and this introduces some uncertainty in the determination of the kinetic rate constant. In order to tackle this, catalyst decay models have been developed, but their realistic application requires conversion data obtained at very short times on stream. Recently [ 14], a reaction system has been developed which allows to obtain reliable results at very short times on stream. Using this experimental set, it has been demonstrated that at high reaction temperatures and relatively low alkane partial pressure, the kinetic results of cracking are well fitted by a first order kinetic expression combined with a concentration dependent decay model. In this work, and using the above methodology, we have studied the influence of the n-alkane chain length on the catalytic cracking behaviour on a series of three zeolites with different pore sizes, i.e. ZSM-5, Beta and USY. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials The USY zeolite catalyst was prepared by exchanging an SK-40 NaY zeolite with NW at 80. The zeolite was steam-calcined at 550 during 3 h followed by NW exchange-calcination (500) twice. The final unit cell size of the catalyst was 24.46 A, being the Na20 content 0.106 wt.-%. Zeolite Beta was prepared by methods described previously [ 15 ] . ZSM-5 was synthesized by standard methods [ 16] . The Beta and ZSM-5 zeolites were first calcined at 550, and then twice exchanged with NH 4 and calcined at 550 in order to produce the hydrogen form. The final samples were pelletized, crushed and sieved, and particles with 0.30-0.50 mm were used. Several properties of the catalysts used are given in Table 1. n-Heptane, n-decane, n-dodecane and n-tetradecane (99 + %) were obtained from Aldrich and were used without further purification. NZ (99.999% purity) was used as a carrier gas.

A. Corma et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 117 (1994) 290 31 2.2. Reaction procedure The experiments were performed at 500 and atmospheric pressure in a fixed bed continuous glass reactor of 11 mm internal diameter and 300 mm length equipped with a coaxial thermocouple for measuring the temperature of the catalytic bed. The reactor was heated with an electric furnace. The zeolite was diluted with Si02 (BASF). The length of the catalyst bed remained constant. The N2/HC molar ratio was always 9. The HC flow was 7.7 X 10-6 mol s-'. The reactor exit is connected to a multisampling computer controlled heated valve (0.25 cc/ loop). A hydrocarbon detector is located at the outlet of the valve in order to detect in a very precise way the moment when hydrocarbon fills the first loop. This moment is considered the zero reaction time, and automatically the sample is kept in the first loop. The rest of the loops were automatically filled, as programmed, at 6, 18, 39, 90, 180, 330 and 600 s on stream. After the experiment is finished the samples were separated in a 100 m capillary column (Supelco-Petrocol), and analyzed using two detectors ( TCD and FID). The contact time was varied between 1.47 and 91.63 kg s m - 3, by changing the weight of catalyst. Several experiments were duplicated and triplicated and the reproducibility was excellent. The fitting of experimental instantaneous conversion was carried out by minimizing the sum of the square of the errors or residuals (least-square technique) by means of Marquardt's algorithm. 3. Results and discussion . With the experimental set describe above it is possible to follow the evolution of the instantaneous conversion with time on stream at the reactor exit. In Figs. 13 the results obtained for all the reactants on the three different zeolite catalysts are given. By looking to the conversion curves it is already possible to deduce that with the catalyst used the decay decreases in the order USY > Beta ZSM-5. Besides, it can also be seen that in the case of the fastest decaying USY catalyst, most of the activity has been lost during the first 20 s. In the case of zeolite Beta, it appears that the activity decay during the very first seconds is very strong, perhaps even stronger than on the USY, but soon it levels off, globally showing a slower decay than the USY zeolite catalyst. The behaviour shown by the Beta zeolite is even more pronounced on the ZSM-5, which suffers a very fast small decay, and after this, the activity stays practically constant. These results already suggest that the mechanism for catalyst decay should be different for the three zeolites, and this should be reflected on the kinetic decay parameters, i.e., decay constant and order of decay. In a previous article [ 14] , it was demonstrated that under the reaction conditions used the following rate expression could be applied to successfully fit the conversion results: 32 A.

A model like this is consistent with the observed fact that a direct relation ship exists between the amount of coke and catalyst decay [ 18] and in according with this the particle coke content should not be uniform along the bed. The integration of Eq. 1 coupled with the decay model makes it possible to calculate the instantaneous conversion at the outlet of the reactor. By using this procedure the results given in Figs. 1 and 2 were fitted to Eqs. l and 2. Good fittings were obtained on the different reactants and with the different catalysts, and the results are given in Table 2. Notice that no catalyst decay was considered on ZSM5 (sOisr=o, O=1>. When the decay parameters given in Table 2 are compared it can be seen, that the decay constants for Beta zeolite are higher than for USY, and the order of decay is also sensibly higher on the former. These results are in agreement with the discussed behaviour of the curves in Figs. 1 and 2, and could be explained assuming that most of the catalyst decay on Beta zeolite is due to pore blocking by coke or by the coke precursors. Then, since the decay behaviour is given by both kmd and m, we have compared the influence of hydrocarbon chain length on the rate of 34 ioo 80 60 X 10. 20' 80 7 60 X ro, W A.

Results shown in Figs. 1, 2 and 4 indicate that on USY zeolite catalyst decay increases when increasing the carbon chain length while on Beta zeolite, it decreases. 35 3.1. Kinetics results With our experimental set up it is possible to obtain for USY and Beta catalysts, the cracking activity in absence of decay, i.e., X at zero time on stream. When these results were adequately plotted versus contact time, defined by CAlFA(Figs. 5 and 6 ) , it can be seen that a good fitting is obtained to a first order rate expression. From the slope of the straight lines, the kinetic rate constants were obtained (Table 3), and their values are in very good agreement with those produced when the conversions affected by decay were fitted to Eqs. 1 and 2 (Table 2). The kinetic rate constants given in Tables 2 and 3 therefore show that the cracking activity per weight of catalyst follows the order: USY =Beta > ZSM-5. The same is observed if a normalized rate constant is calculated when considering the surface area presented in Table 1. However, when the number of the original framework A1 is considered, and a turnover number is calculated by dividing the normalized kinetic rate constant by the number of framework A1 per gram of zeolite (Fig. 7), it can be seen that the order of activity is Beta > ZSM-5 > USY. A similar conclusion could be reached when the activity per molecule of pyridinium ions remaining adsorbed after desorption at 250 and 10 - Torr was calculated ( Table 4 ) . This behaviour could indicate that in Beta zeolite the fraction of active sites remaining after the zeolites activation process is higher than in ZSM-5 and USY zeolites. 36 _ 15 X c J_ W 10 x 5 0 A.

Turnover number (normalized activity/AiNj for USY (O), Beta (O) and ZSM-5 (d) catalyst vs. chain length. From previous publications [ 19,20], one may expect the activity per site, i.e., per framework Al, to follow the order ZSM-5 > Beta > USY. The fact that the value obtained is smaller for ZSM-5 than for Beta indicates that the ZSM-5 sample has suffered a relatively higher dealumination compared to the Beta zeolite during the activation procedure. Indeed, the 2'Al NMR MAS spectrum shows that dealumination has occurred in the ZSM-5 zeolite during the calcination step, while in the case of the Beta zeolite the final effect of \"dealumination\" could be smaller owing to its partial reversibility [ 21 ] . Another explanation for this behaviour could take into account that in ZSM-5 cracking processes only take place by protolytic monomolecular reactions [ 1 ] while in Beta and USY zeolites the coexistence of monomolecular and bimolecular reactions are evident [ 20] . Therefore, in Beta and USY zeolites the activity per site can be distorted because the catalyst activity in Table 2 shows the effect of two mechanisms. When the influence of the carbon chain length on cracking activity is considered (Table 2), this increases for the three zeolites studied when increasing the number of carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon. The fact has been related with the statistical Table 4 Activity per molecule of pyridinium ion adsorbed after desorption at 250 and 10-TorfTON - 1025 (m' molec. -' s-') Reactant Catalyst USY Beta ZSM-5 C, 9.08 50.2 9.69 CM 31.5 180 32.8 C17 47.9 241 63.8 C,4 65.1 289 111 38 A.

However, when the cracking rate per crackable bond was calculated considering the carbon number (N) and the protolytic and the -scission mechanisms (Table 5), it can be seen that this parameter increases when increasing the carbon chain length for both mechanisms considered. This behaviour was already observed by Voge [22] and Nace [ 5 ] , and related to an increase in the adsorption when increasing the hydrocarbon chain length. Recently [ 13 ] this increase has been explained on the basis of the existence of bimolecular reactions which alterate the values of the kinetic rate constants calculated from a pseudofirst order kinetic expression. The influence of the carbon chain length on the relative reactivity of the n-alkane does not correspond to the values predicted by considering as the only mechanism either a protolytic or J3-scission mechanism, nor combinations of those (Fig. 8). However, if we consider a recently proposed mechanism for the cracking of alkanes [ 23,24] , which assumes that protonated cyclopropane rings (PCP) are the intermediate Table 5 Cracking rate per crackable bond' Reactant Catalyst USY Beta ZSM-5 Prot. ss-sci.

When the experimental results obtained on the different zeolites are plotted (Fig. 9) they follow quiet well the behaviour predicted by the PCP mechanism. 4. Conclusions By using the experimental methodology proposed it has been possible to study the influence of zeolite structure and hydrocarbon chain length on cracking activity and decay. The results obtained support the hypothesis that cracking of alkanes on monofunctional acid catalyst can occur through protonated cyclopropane ring intermediates. References [ 1 ] W.O. Haag and R.M.

Kinetic determinations of the cracking and catalytic decay of n-heptane, n-decane, n-dodecane and n-tetradecane have been carried out on USY, Beta and ZSM-5 zeolites by means of an experimental set which allows to take samples of products coming out from the reactor at very short time on stream. The influence of the zeolite properties on the catalytic activity and catalyst decay has been obtained. By studying the evolution of the rate constants with the number of carbon atoms in the n-alkanes it has been found that the existence of a PCP cracking mechanism would be consistent with the observed evolution.
