Graphical abstract The carbon nanofiber (CNF) supported two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin NiSe2-CoSe2 heterostructure was constructed as bifunctional electrode host material in lithium-sulfur batteries. The material presents superior performance of lithium polysulfide conversion and uniform deposition of lithium. The commercialization of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is obstructed by the sluggish sulfur electrochemical reaction, severe polysulfide shuttling effect, and damaging dendritic lithium growth. Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) conductive carbon nanofibers skeleton-based bifunctional electrode host material is fabricated, which consists of a two-dimensional (2D) ultra-thin NiSe2-CoSe2 heterostructured nanosheet built on one-dimensional (1D) carbon nanofibers (NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF). When serving as cathodic host, the heterostructured NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF offers a synergistic function of polysulfide confinement and catalysis conversion. The S/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF cathode shows outstanding cycling stability of 0.03% capacity decay rate per cycle over 500 cycles at 1 C. As anodic host, the NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF with high-flux Li+ diffusion property and good lithiophilic capability realizes dendrite-free Li plating/stripping behavior. Benefiting from these synergistically merits, the Li-S full cell with S/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF|Li/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF electrodes exhibits excellent electrochemical performance including a high specific capacity of 1021 mA h g−1 over 100 cycles at 0.2 C and reversible areal capacity of 3.05 mA h cm−2 under a high sulfur loading of 4.33 mg cm−2 at 0.1 C. The pouch cell also delivers ultra-stable Li/S electrochemistry. This study demonstrates a rational and universal electrode construction strategy for developing practical and high-energy Li-S batteries. Keywords Polysulfides shuttling Lithium dendrites Catalytic conversion NiSe2-CoSe2 heterostructure Pouch cell 1 Introduction Due to the growing demand for the next-generation battery system for portable electronic devices and electric vehicles, the lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have drawn wide-ranging attention because of their high theoretical specific capacity (1675 mA h g−1) and considerable specific energy density (2600 W h kg−1) [1,2]. Despite these advantages, there are still several major obstacles associated with both the cathode and anode of the Li-S battery system [3,4], such as (i) the shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfide (LiPS) and the slow kinetics of sulfur redox conversion; (ii) dendritic lithium caused by the uneven deposition of lithium on the anode side. Therefore, the development of high-performance cathode or anode host materials in the Li-S system has been a hot topic in the field of energy storage studies. Nanostructured carbon materials, such as carbon nanofibers, carbon nanotubes, graphene [5,6], and their hybrids, have attracted great attention in Li-S electrodes design. However, a noteworthy obstacle is the non-polar nature of the carbonaceous materials, leading to poor polysulfides trapping capability and slow reaction kinetics [7–9]. Facing with this problem, porous structure design and surface modification of carbon materials are usually adopted for polysulfides anchoring, catalysis promotion, and homogenous Li nucleus [10–14]. For example, various materials such as metal selenides [15], metal sulfide [16], alloy compound [17] with morphology of nanoparticles [18], nanosheet [19], etc. have been developed as promosing electrodes in Li-S batteries. However, most of the reported studies have mainly focused on their applications in sulfur cathode. Recently, electronic structure modulation such as defects [20] and heterostructure engineering [21] of the electrode with rich chemical active sites is reported for synchronously solving the issues in both cathode and anode of Li-S batteries. Particularly, transition metals compounds with heterogeneous structure design are used as sulfur and lithium hosts [22,23]. It is reported that the heterostructures that coupled with two crystal phases would generate a built-in electric field during the catalytic reaction. At the same time, nano-heterostructures can provide adsorption sites for LiPS and facilitate fast sulfur reaction kinetics [24–28]. Furthermore, such heterostructure host design realizes the increase of charge transfer rate, homogenized Li+ flux, and limited volume fluctuation, which significantly suppresses lithium dendrite formation. In the present study, a three-dimensional (3D) conductive carbon nanofibers skeleton-based bifunctional electrode host material is constructed using carbon nanofiber (CNF) supported two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin NiSe2-CoSe2 heterostructure. Distinguishing from previous studies, this unique NiSe2-CoSe2 heterostructure design is introduced on CNF to serve as the self-supporting cathode and anode host. When employed as the sulfur immobilizer, NiSe2-CoSe2 heterostructure offers active catalytic sites for LiPS adsorption and conversion with enhanced charge transfer performance. The synergy between NiSe2/CoSe2 heterostructures can adjust the electronic structure, lead to interfacial charge redistribution, and significantly improve its electronic conductivity. As an anode host, the NiSe2-CoSe2 heterostructure guides the uniform deposition of lithium and reduces the overpotential during the nucleation process, thereby effectively suppressing Li dendrites growth. Due to these merits, the S/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF|Li/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF full Li-S battery system is able to achieve a reversible capacity of 943 mA h g−1 at 1 C after 500 cycles, and shows an areal capacity of 3.05 mA h cm−2 under high sulfur loading of 4.33 mg cm−2 at 0.1 C. Importantly, the flexible pouch battery exhibits surprisingly stable cycling performance (capacity decay of ∼0.19% per cycle) during 50 cycles at 0.2 C. This NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF multifunctional electrode design fulfills the requirement for developing flexible Li-S batteries. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of Co/CNF 1.5 g polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA, Aladdin, M w = 35,000) and 1.25 g Co(Ac)2 (Aladdin, 98%) are dissolved in 20 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, Aladdin, 99.8%) under vigorously stirring at 75 °C for 1 h. Then, 0.1 g CNT (MWCNT, Aladdin, C139823, 95%) and 2 g polyacrylonitrile (PAN, Aladdin, M w = 150,000) are added to the electrospinning precursor solution by stirring for 12 h at room temperature. Finally, the viscous solution is placed into a syringe and connected to a stainless steel nozzle with a high direct current (DC) voltage for electrospinning. The electrospinning parameters are as follows: voltage 11 kV, flow rate 0.5 mL h−1, 14 cm distance from the nozzle to the aluminum foil collector, and a collector speed of 200 r min−1. The obtained preliminary nanofiber film is referred as Co/CNF. 2.2 Preparation of Ni-Co LDH@Co/CNF The obtained Co/CNF film is dried in an oven at 60 °C for 3 h, and then placed in tube furnace for heat treatment in Ar gas. The heating program is kept at 155 °C for 4 h and 270 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1, and then kept at 700 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 1 °C min−1. Meanwhile, 291.3 mg Co(NO3)2∙6H2O, 290.8 mg Ni(NO3)2∙6H2O, and 600 mg hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA, Aladdin, 99.0%) are added and dissolved to 30 mL methanol (Kermel, 99.5%). The precursor solution and the heat treated Co/CNF are transferred into a Teflon liner autoclave, which is put in the oven and kept at 180 °C for 12 h for hydrothermal treatment. After that, the obtained spun film is washed with distilled water and ethanol. The product is defined as Ni-Co LDH@Co/CNF (LDH, layered double hydroxide). In addition, Ni LDH@Co/CNF and Co LDH@Co/CNF are also prepared using the same experimental procedure with nickel and cobalt salt, respectively. 2.3 Preparation of NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF, CoSe2@CNF, and NiSe2@CNF The selenization process is conducted in a quartz tube filled with Ar gas. The mass ratio of Ni-Co LDH@Co/CNF film to the selenium powder (Aladdin, 200 mesh, 99.9%) is 2:1. Then, the spun film is placed downstream and selenized at 450 °C for 2 h at a heating rate of 2 °C min−1. The synthesis of CoSe2@CNF and NiSe2@CNF control samples is conducted using the same procedure as that of NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF with Co(OH)2@Co/CNF or Ni(NO3)2∙6H2O rather than Ni-Co LDH@Co/CNF. 2.4 Preparation of S/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF The pre-prepared 0.5 M S/CS2 solution is dropped into a 1 cm diameter NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF circular electrode with sulfur loading of 1.0 mg cm−2 and dried at room temperature. For comparison, S/CoSe2@CNF and S/NiSe2@CNF electrodes are also prepared. 2.5 Preparation of Li/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF Based on the geometric surface area of NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF electrode, a constant current density of 1 mA cm−2 is used for lithium electroplating, and the ratio of Li areal capacity (mA h cm−2) to S loading (mg cm−2) is fixed at 4:1. The Cu foil is used as the counter/reference electrode for lithium electroplating. 2.6 Physical characterization The morphology and structure of the samples are investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7800F, JEOL), transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2100, JEOL), atomic force microscope (AFM, Nanoscope, IIIa), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET, V-Sorb 2800P). The composite is also characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker AXS with Cu-K α radiation source), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB250Xi, Thermo), thermal gravimetric analyzer (TGA, TG/DTA-6300, NSK), and Raman (Thermo Scientific, Waltham). In-situ optical microscope is used to study the Li-plating process of NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF electrode and Cu electrode within 1 h on an electrochemical workstation at a current density of 1 mA cm−2. 2.7 Electrochemical measurements The sulfur content in coin cell is 1.0 mg cm−2. The electrode area is 0.8 cm−2. The anode is commercial lithium plate (16 × 0.6 mm2), and the electrolyte/sulfur ratio (E/S) is 15 μL mg−1. The sulfur content in all electrodes was fixed at 1.0 mg cm−1. In the Li-S full battery, S/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF (S/NiSe2@CNF and S/CoSe2@CNF) and Li/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF (Li/NiSe2@CNF and Li/CoSe2@CNF) were used as cathode and anode, respectively. A Celgard 2300 separator was used to assemble CR2032 coin cell in an Ar-filled glove box. In this work, the E/S of Li-S full-cells and pouch cells is approximately 15 and 20 μL mg−1, respectively. The electrolyte is composed of 1 M bis (trifluoromethane) sulfonamide lithium salt (LiTFSI), a solvent mixture of 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) and 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) (1:1, v/v), and 1 wt% LiNO3 additive. The charge/discharge test is conducted on the BTS-5 V battery test system. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) test is carried out in a CHI 760E workstation in the range from 1.7 to 2.8 V at 0.1 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is performed at 100 kHz–0.01 Hz under amplitude of 5 mV. 2.8 Assembly of Li2S6 symmetric cells The Li2S6 solution was obtained by mixing sulfur powder and Li2S in DOL/DME solution (1:1, v/v) at a molar ratio of 5:1, and then being kept at 60 °C for 24 h in an Ar-filled glove box. The symmetrical CR2032 cell was prepared using S/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF as a symmetrical cathode and anode host with Celgard 2300 separator. 2.9 Lithium sulfide adsorption test The 0.01 M Li2S6 solution was prepared by dissolving Li2S and S with a molar ratio of 1:5 into DOL/DME solution (1:1, v/v). Then, 10 mg NiSe2@CNF, CoSe2@CNF, and NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF were immersed in 10 mL Li2S6 solution. 2.10 Lithium sulfide nucleation test In this test, the NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF, NiSe2@CNF, and CoSe2@CNF were used as cathode hosts with Celgard 2300 separator. 20 μL Li2S8 catholyte was added onto the cathode, and 20 μL 1.0 M LiTFSI (DME/DOL, 1:1 volume ratio) electrolyte onto the anode. The cell was discharged to 2.06 V with a constant current of 0.112 mA and then discharged at a constant potential of 2.05 V to achieve the nucleation and growth of Li2S. The discharge procedure is terminated when the current is less than 10−5 A. 2.11 Theoretical calculation Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP), in which the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)-based Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional was adopted. In the calculation, a 2 × 2 × 1 k-point mesh was used for the slab model, and the vacuum high is set to 15 Å. All the models were completely relaxed, and the force convergence is 0.01 eV Å−1. The binding energy (E b) was calculated as E b = E ( s ubstrate) + E (Li 2 S x ) − E ( t otal), where E ( s ubstrate), E (Li2S x ), and E (total) represent the energy of the NiSe2/CoSe2/NiSe2-CoSe2 slab, the energy of various polysulfides (x = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8), and total energy of the system, respectively. The barriers for Li2S diffusion were obtained with the climbing-image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method. 3 Results and discussion As shown in Fig. 1 (a), the synthesis of NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF includes electrospinning, hydrothermal treatment, and selenization process. The electrospinning precursor solution consists of PMMA perforated in the fiber, CNF filling the spinning gap, and cobalt acetate as catalytic source. After electrospinning and calcining the spinning membrane, Co/CNF is generated. Then, nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxide (Ni-Co LDH) is grown on Co/CNF by hydrothermal method. After selenization process, NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF composite is obtained (Fig. S1). The SEM image of NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF shows that the interconnected fibers are well cross-linked into a conductive 3D network structure, which can effectively form a binder-free and flexible film (Fig. 1b). The corresponding energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mappings of C, Co, Ni, and Se atoms are shown in Fig. 1(c). The TEM image shows that the nanowrinkles embedded with NiSe2-CoSe2 heterostructure are inserted into carbon fibers (Fig. 1d and e), and the layered structure of Ni-Co LDH is well preserved. The AFM measurement indicates that the thickness of NiSe2-CoSe2 nanosheets is about ∼5 nm (Fig. S2). The close contact between wrinkled nanosheets and carbon nanorods is expected to promote Li+ and electron transfer and maintain robust structural integrity, benefiting the fast and stable charge-discharge cycle process. Note that, the SEM images of Co/NF, Co/CNF, and Ni-Co LDH@Co/CNF are presented in Figs. S3 and S4. The heterointerface structure can be identified in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) of NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF as marked with different colors (Fig. 1f). The lattice spacing of 0.262 nm corresponds to (210) crystal planes of CoSe2, and the lattice spacing of 0.299 nm can be assigned to the (200) crystal planes of NiSe2 (Fig. 1g). Additional HRTEM images showing the heterointerface structure are shown in Fig. S5. Furthermore, the TEM-EDS mapping shows that the C, Co, Ni, and Se elements of the NiSe2-CoSe2 are evenly distributed, confirming that the heterostructures are uniformly distributed in the 2D sheets throughout the nanofiber surface (Fig. 1h and Fig. S6). The XRD patterns of NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF are consistent with the standard powder diffraction cards of NiSe2 (41-1495) and CoSe2 (09-0234), indicating the existence of pyrite-type cubic NiSe2 and CoSe2 (Fig. 2 a) [29]. For comparison, NiSe2@CNF and CoSe2@CNF are also synthesized. Fig. S7 provides the SEM images of CoSe2@CNF and NiSe2@CNF. Figs. S8–S10 further show the XRD spectra of Ni-Co LDH@Co/CNF, CoSe2@CNF, and NiSe2@CNF, respectively [30]. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the Raman spectra of these samples are compared. The lower intensity ratio of the D- to G-band (I D/I G) is 0.896 for NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF, implying its highly graphitized carbon structure [31]. Fig. 2(c) presents the BET analysis of NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF, Ni-Co LDH@Co/CNF, and Co@CNF. It shows that NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF exhibits the highest specific surface area (88.0 m2 g−1) compared with Ni-Co LDH@Co/CNF (54.5 m2 g−1) and Co@CNF (11.7 m2 g−1). The pore size distribution reveals a relatively concentrated pore size in the range from 2 to 10 nm, as seen the inserted diagram in Fig. 2(c). A higher specific surface area can enhance the physical confinement of polysulfides and inhibit its shuttle effect. Additionally, the sulfur loading in NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF, CoSe2@CNF, and NiSe2@CNF composites is found to be 76.7, 71.5, and 65.1 wt%, respectively (Fig. S11). At the same time, it is expected that the anode host embedded with the ultra-thin layered structure and the rich mesoporous structure would facilitate the uniform deposition of Li and inhibit the formation of dendritic lithium [32,33]. The surface chemistry of NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF is analyzed by XPS. Wide-scan XPS spectra of NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF is shown in Fig. S12. Fig. 2(d) shows the Ni 2p high-resolution spectrum, and peaks at 855.9 and 873.5 eV are attributed to the Ni 2p 3/2 and Ni 2p 1/2 of Ni3+ state, respectively. The other two peaks at 853.4 eV for Ni 2p 3/2 and 870.0 eV for Ni 2p 1/2 can be assigned to Ni2+ state. Fig. 2(e) shows the Co 2p spectrum. The two peaks at 781.1 and 797.3 eV can be ascribed to the Co 2p 3/2 and Co 2p 1/2 of Co2+ state, respectively, whereas the peaks at 778.7 and 794.2 eV can be attributed to the Co3+ state. For the Se 3d spectrum in Fig. 2(f), the peak at 58.9 eV corresponds to the SeO x species formed on the surface, and the other two peaks at 54.6 and 55.5 eV can be assigned to Se 3d 5/2 and Se 3d 3/2 state, respectively [34–37]. Through constant potential discharge experiment tests, it is proved that NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF promotes the LiPS reduction process, which is manifested in higher Li2S deposition activity and faster nucleation conversion rate (Fig. S13a). According to the Avrami equation [38,39], the nucleation of Li2S on NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF is calculated to be 282.1 mA h g−1, which is much higher than that on CoSe2@CNF (260.8 mA h g−1) and NiSe2@CNF (229.1 mA h g−1). These results show that NiSe2-CoSe2 heterostructures greatly promote the conversion of liquid LiPS to solid Li2S. To further study the LiPS transformation kinetics, symmetrical cells are assembled with NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF, CoSe2@CNF, and NiSe2@CNF electrodes using 0.2 M Li2S6 solution as electrolyte. It can be seen that NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF exhibits the maximum peak area in the CV curve, which proves its high LiPS conversion and sulfur utilization performance (Fig. S13b). Moreover, the CV curve of NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF symmetrical cell maintains well in different cycles (Fig. S13c). This indicates that the oxidation/reduction process of LiPS is highly reversible, demonstrating the good stability performance of NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF. The overall resistance characteristic of the cell is analyzed by EIS spectroscopy, see Fig. S13(d). The charge transfer resistance is 8.3 Ω cm2 for NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF, much lower than that of S/CoSe2@CNF (28.5 Ω cm2) and S/NiSe2@CNF (36.0 Ω cm2) [40]. The prepared samples are assembled into CR2032 cells to test their electrochemical performance as sulfur cathode. In the CV of S/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF cathode, the cathodic and anodic peaks maintain almost the same intensity and position, implying the good cycle stability and reversibility of the cathode (Fig. S14a). The S/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF cell shows a high initial capacity of 1251 mA h g−1 at 0.2 C (Fig. S14b). After 100 cycles, the capacity can still be maintained at 1104 mA h g−1 and the platform potential remains almost intact, outperforming that of S/NiSe2@CNF and S/CoSe2@CNF cathode (Fig. S14c). It is expected that the improved electrochemical performance of S/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF is attributed to the strong electronic coupling between the NiSe2-CoSe2 heterostructures that can effectively restrict the shuttle behavior of polysulfides. Furthermore, the rate capacity test is presented in Fig. S14(d). One can see that the S/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF electrode provides the highest capacity of 1256 and 711 mA h g−1 at 0.2 and 5.0 C, respectively. When the C-rate reduces back to 0.2 C, the capacity returns to a high capacity of 1073 mA h g−1. In addition, the reversible discharge/charge voltage curves in Fig. S14(e) show that, even at 5.0 C, the S/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF cathode still exhibits a stable voltage plateau, implying its excellent stability and reversibility performance. Note that, the semicircle in Nyquist plot of high-frequency region is associated with the charge transfer resistance (R ct) of the cell, and the sloped line in the low-frequency region refers to the Warburg impedance [41,42]. One can see that, S/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF has the lowest R ct value of 20.5 Ω cm2, compared to S/CoSe2@CNF (52.4 Ω cm2) and S/NiSe2@CNF (62.5 Ω cm2), indicating its excellent electron transportation performance (Fig. S14f). To further confirm the excellent cycle performance of S/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF, the long cycling test at 1 C rate is performed, see Fig. S14(g). The initial discharge capacity of S/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF reaches 1004 mA h g−1 at 1 C, and the discharge capacity is maintained at 876 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles with a high-capacity retention rate of 87.3%. The S/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF cathodes with high sulfur loading of 6.2, 5.2, and 4.3 mg cm−2 under the E/S of 5 μL mg−1 are assembled, achieving an initial areal capacity of 5.6, 4.8, and 3.2 mA h cm−2, respectively (Fig. S15). The electrochemical performance of the S/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF cathode is highly competitive compared to the cathodes in recently reported literatures (Table S1). Finally, a double-layer pouch cell was assembled. The S/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF was fixed on both sides of the Al foil as cathode, and the Li foil (0.025 mm thickness) anode was cut to the same size. The corresponding schematic diagram of pouch cell is shown in Fig. S16. The sulfur loading is 12 mg cm−2 and the E/S is 3 μL mg−1. As shown in Fig. S17, the initial capacity of pouch cell is 1233 mA h g−1, and it delivers a specific energy of 231.9 W h kg−1, the digital photograph and weight of each component are shown in the insert picture. The interaction and transformation mechanism of LiPS on NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF is further clarified by theoretical calculations. Fig. 3 (a) presents the optimized adsorption models of representative LiPS species on NiSe2, CoSe2, and NiSe2-CoSe2 [24,43]. The corresponding binding energies are presented in Fig. 3(b). The results show that, compared with NiSe2 and CoSe2, NiSe2-CoSe2 exhibits higher binding energy for LiPS, which is beneficial for trapping LiPS and suppressing their shuttle effect during electrochemical processes. Additionally, the charge density difference (CDD) calculation suggests that, compared with NiSe2 and CoSe2, there exists an entanglement of the positive and negative electron cloud regions in NiSe2-CoSe2 (Fig. 3c–e). This implies there is more electron transfer between the electron-rich and electron-deficient regions between the NiSe2 and CoSe2 domains within NiSe2-CoSe2. Fig. 3(f) shows visual adsorption experiments and the UV-vis spectrum. Compared with that of CoSe2@CNF and NiSe2@CNF, the color of the Li2S6 solution with NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF becomes transparent within 12 h, which explains that Li2S6 in solution is almost completely absorbed. The strong Li2S6 adsorption capacity of NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF is consistent with results of the UV-vis spectrum and the DFT calculations. Also, the peaks of terminal sulfur (ST −1) and bridging sulfur (SB 0) shift toward higher binding energy range after adsorption, revealing the electron transfer between LiPS and surface of NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF. There is a higher peak intensity of thiosulfate and sulfate species in LiPS@NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF than that of pure LiPS, which also proves the interaction between NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF and polysulfides (Fig. S18a). The XPS of NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF for the Ni 2p peaks before and after cycling is shown in Fig. S18(b). The results show that, before cycling test, it exhibits two peaks located at 854.9 and 872.4 eV, which correspond to Ni 3d 3/2 and Ni 3d 1/2, respectively. However, after cycling, the peaks of Ni 2p 1/2 and Ni 2p 3/2 shift to a lower value, which indicates the gaining of electrons in Ni state. This further demonstrates that NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF has a strong anchoring effect for polysulfides. The Li 1s XPS spectra show a peak at 55.1 eV ascribed to the Li–S bonding, whereas two new peaks emerge at 55.5 and 59.3 eV referred to the Li–N/O and Li–C bonding [44], signifying the formation of the “lithium bond”-like configuration (Fig. S19). The above results confirm the strong interaction between NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF and LiPS. In addition, the kinetics of Li2S decomposition is also investigated (Fig. 3g), and the Li2S decomposition barrier on NiSe2-CoSe2 (0.19 eV) is found much lower than that on CoSe2 (0.51 eV) and NiSe2 (0.79 eV). This result suggests that the synergistic effect of NiSe2-CoSe2 heterostructure effectively catalyzes the breakage of Li–S bond and accelerates the reaction kinetics [45]. Moreover, the catalytic activity of Li2S oxidation is explored by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and Tafel plots (Fig. 3h and Fig. S20). The LSV test is performed in a three-electrode system at a scan speed of 5 mV s−1 in 0.1 M Li2S/methanol solution. It can be seen that, compared with that of CoSe2@CNF (−0.48 V) and NiSe2@CNF (−0.43 V), the onset potential of NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF is much lower (−0.56 V). NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF also shows a higher current density and a smaller Tafel slope, indicating that NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF can greatly reduce the overpotential of Li2S oxidation with improved catalytic effect. Furthermore, by evaluating the Li-ion diffusion behavior on the anode host surface, the improvement of Li-ion diffusion kinetics caused by the NiSe2-CoSe2 heterostructure is revealed [46–48]. The energy barriers of Li-ion on NiSe2 (200), CoSe2 (210), and NiSe2-CoSe2 surfaces are calculated to be 0.30, 0.28, and 0.13 eV, respectively. The low Li-ion diffusion barrier indicates that the NiSe2-CoSe2 as lithophilic sites can significantly promote ion transfer and reversible transformation of Li-ion (Fig. 4 a and Fig. S21). The CDD configuration in Fig. S22 implies that the electron dissipation region of NiSe2-CoSe2 is mainly concentrated in the Li atoms, and most of the charge is transferred to the vicinity of Co atoms. The charge migration reduces the diffusion energy barrier of Li-ions, which is beneficial for inducing the uniform Li deposition. In addition, the total density of states (TDOS) patterns of NiSe2-CoSe2 (0.66 eV) shows a smaller band gap than that of CoSe2 (0.77 eV) and NiSe2 (1.24 eV), see Fig. 4(b). The reduced the band gap makes it easier for electron transitions from the valence band to the conduction band, which would improve the electrical conductivity of NiSe2-CoSe2. Furthermore, Fig. 4(c) shows that the Ni d-band center of NiSe2-CoSe2 (−1.54 eV) is higher compared to that of NiSe2 (−1.71 eV). Similarly, in Fig. 4(d), the Co d-band center of NiSe2-CoSe2 (−1.32 eV) is also higher than that of CoSe2 (−1.39 eV). In addition to serve as cathode host, the good conductivity and Li-ion surface diffusivity also make the 3D structured NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF suitable to achieve dendrite-free lithium on the anode. To support this argument, the Li deposition behavior on the NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF electrode is characterized by in-situ optical microscopy. It can be seen that the irregular growth of lithium clusters is observed during the electroplating process of Cu-foil (Fig. 5 a). On the other hand, this Li metallic cluster is not observed on NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF surface in the first 30 min. That is, the initial lithium deposition occurs within its 3D network, leading to deformation of NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF (Fig. 5b). After that, no apparent volume change is observed during the continuous electroplating process, realizing uniform insertion and dense bonding of lithium. These results indicate that, as the anode host, NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF shows the inhibition of dendritic lithium growth under the electroplating conditions of 1 mA cm−2 within 1 h. The discharge potential profile of symmetric cells and corresponding SEM images under different plating durations are displayed in Fig. 5(c). During the deposition, the thickness of the electrode gradually increases, and metallic lithium gradually fills the gaps in the carbon fiber network of NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF. Fig. S23 shows the plating/stripping images of NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF electrode after 50 cycles performed at 1, 3, and 5 mA h cm−2. Even the plating specific area capacity is as high as 5 mA h cm−2, ultra-fine and smooth Li deposition can be also achieved, whereas the bare Cu surface shows uneven deposition and undesirable Li dendrites. These observations highlight the advantage of NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF in improving the electrochemical performance of the anode. To further evaluate the lithophilic feature of NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF, the Li nucleation overpotential is measured at a current density of 1 mA cm−2 (Fig. S24). It is found that NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF exhibits a nucleation overpotential of 16.1 mV much lower than bare Cu (85.9 mV). This proves the strong lithophilic affinity of NiSe2-CoSe2 heterostructure, which can significantly reduce the overpotential of Li nucleation and decrease the local current density of uniform Li deposition. On the other hand, this conclusion is further supported by the EIS analysis, and Fig. S25 shows that the NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF electrode has the lowest R ct value. The electrochemical performance of the batteries assembled with bare Cu and NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF anode is further evaluated. Fig. 5(d and e) demonstrates that the NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF electrode shows a stable cycle at 1 mA cm−2 for 260 h and maintains low voltage hysteresis (∼32 mV), whereas the bare Cu exhibits much higher and unstable voltage hysteresis (∼60 mV). Fig. 5(f) shows the Coulombic efficiency (CE) in the plating/stripping of bare Cu and NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF electrodes. One can see that the CE of NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF is very stable and maintains high level during cycling. However, the CE of bare Cu electrode is relatively low and unstable. Notably, the NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF cell can still maintain a very stable long-term cycling, a smooth low voltage hysteresis (∼54 mV), and high CE under high current density (5 mA cm−2), see Fig. 5(g–i). For comparison, the CE curve of bare Cu electrode is extremely unstable, and it fluctuates greatly in a short cycle. The Li anode stripping/plating performance in this work is very competitive with the reported lithium electrodes, demonstrating the good performance of Li/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF in boosting the homogenous Li growth (Table S2). Taking into account the unique advantages of NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF as a bifunctional matrix for sulfur cathode and Li anode host, a Li-S full cell of S/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF|Li/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF is assembled, and the Li/Cu anode is used for comparison (Fig. 6 a). The CV curve of S/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF|Li/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF cell presents two cathodic peaks at 2.2–2.4 and 1.9–2.1 V (Fig. 6b). Fig. 6(c) shows the cycle performance of different Li-S full cell at 0.2 C. The reversible capacity of S/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF|Li/Cu is only 747 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. S/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF|Li/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 1243 mA h g−1 and maintains a capacity of 1021 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles, indicating its better electrochemical cycle stability. The average Coulombic efficiency of the S/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF|Li/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF cell is 99.1%, higher than that of S/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF|Li/Cu of 98.2% at 0.2 C. In addition, Fig. 6(d) shows that S/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF|Li/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF battery provides 1256, 1156, 1070, 893, and 698 mA h g−1 at 0.2, 0.4, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 C, respectively. When the rate is reduced back to 0.2 C, the battery capacity restores to 1100 mA h g−1. This indicates that it has fast redox kinetics and good reversible performance, outperforming the S/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF|Li/Cu battery. It is worth noting that the S/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF|Li/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF battery maintains a very stable average Coulombic efficiency of 96.7% under 500 cycles of 1 C, which is higher than S/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF|Li/Cu (92.8%). It delivers an initial capacity of 943 mA h g−1, and the average capacity decay rate is less than 0.05% per cycle (Fig. 6e). This is significantly better than the S/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF|Li/Cu battery, which fails after 310 cycles. In addition, the S/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF|Li/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF full cell with high sulfur loading mass of 4.33 mg cm−2 is assembled. The capacity ratio of negative to positive electrode (N/P) is about 10, and the E/S is 15 μL mg−1. It achieves an areal capacity of 3.05 mA h cm−2, excellent cycling stability, and average Coulombic efficiency of 98.5% for 100 cycles at 0.1 C (Fig. 6f). As a further application demonstration, a flexible pouch battery is assembled based on S/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF and Li/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF electrodes, which can light up the “HEBUT” diode (LED, 1.8 V), see Fig. 6g. The size of pouch cell is 2 × 4 cm2, and it consists of Al plastic, S/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF cathode, separator, Li/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF anode, and there is no electrode stacking (Fig. S26). The cell shows an ultra-stable discharge capacity at different bending angles from 0° to 180° (Fig. 6h). The sulfur loading mass of pouch cell is 3.5 mg cm−2. The electrode area is 8 cm2. The E/S is 20 μL mg−1, and the sulfur content in the pouch cell is 28 mg. The pouch battery also exhibits good cycling performance with a capacity loss of 0.19% per cycle and average Coulombic efficiency of 98.8% during 50 cycles at 0.2 C. In addition, the pouch cell with E/S of 10 μL mg−1 is also prepared, showing an initial capacity is 990 mA h g−1 and maintains 774 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles (Fig. S27). The Li-S flexible battery composed of S/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF|Li/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF demonstrates a great potential in the field of flexible electronics [49,50]. Table S3 shows a comparison of the pouch cell performance with reported electrodes, demonstrating the good practical performance of the NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF electrode. 4 Conclusions In summary, a 3D multifunctional NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF electrode consists of self-supporting carbon nanofibers framework embedded with NiSe2-CoSe2 heterostructure was developed for high-performance Li-S battery. The NiSe2-CoSe2 heterostructure has the advantages of the 2D ultra-thin nanosheets, which provide high specific surface area and sufficient reactive sites. For the cathode side, this heterostructure design not only ensures rapid electronic/ionic transfer through high electrical conductivity, but also offers efficient polysulfide adsorption and catalyzation effect for the sulfur electrochemical reaction. For the anode side, the highly lithium-affinity structure effectively guides the dendrite-free Li growth. The full Li-S battery with S/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF|Li/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF electrodes exhibits excellent electrochemical performance including a high specific capacity of 1021 mA h g−1 over 100 cycles at 0.2 C and a reversible areal capacity of 3.05 mA h cm−2 under a higher sulfur loading of 4.33 mg cm−2 at 0.1 C. In 500 cycles at 1 C, the capacity attenuation per cycle is 0.05%. A flexible Li-S pouch cell also shows good flexibility and ultra-stable electrochemical performance under different bending conditions. The multifunctional electrode design reported in the present study provides a promising route for developing high-energy and stable flexible Li-S battery.

        "dc:description": "The commercialization of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is obstructed by the sluggish sulfur electrochemical reaction, severe polysulfide shuttling effect, and damaging dendritic lithium growth. Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) conductive carbon nanofibers skeleton-based bifunctional electrode host material is fabricated, which consists of a two-dimensional (2D) ultra-thin NiSe2-CoSe2 heterostructured nanosheet built on one-dimensional (1D) carbon nanofibers (NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF). When serving as cathodic host, the heterostructured NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF offers a synergistic function of polysulfide confinement and catalysis conversion. The S/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF cathode shows outstanding cycling stability of 0.03% capacity decay rate per cycle over 500 cycles at 1 C. As anodic host, the NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF with high-flux Li+ diffusion property and good lithiophilic capability realizes dendrite-free Li plating/stripping behavior. Benefiting from these synergistically merits, the Li-S full cell with S/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF|Li/NiSe2-CoSe2@CNF electrodes exhibits excellent electrochemical performance including a high specific capacity of 1021 mA h g−1 over 100 cycles at 0.2 C and reversible areal capacity of 3.05 mA h cm−2 under a high sulfur loading of 4.33 mg cm−2 at 0.1 C. The pouch cell also delivers ultra-stable Li/S electrochemistry. This study demonstrates a rational and universal electrode construction strategy for developing practical and high-energy Li-S batteries.",
