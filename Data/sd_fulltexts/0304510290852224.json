MERCHANT Discipline of Coordination Chemistry and Homogeneous Catalysis, Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research Institute, Bhavnagar 364 002 (India ) (Received January 4,1990; accepted April 27,1990) Summary Kinetics of the epoxidation of cyclohexene, methylcyclohexene and cis-cyclooctene by molecular oxygen catalysed by Ru(III) ion, [RuCVHgC^]'1' at pH 2.0 m a mixed water-dioxane solvent medium are reported. The reactions were studied manometrically as a function of catalyst, substrate and dioxygen concentrations. For all the substrates studied, the rate of oxidation is first order with respect to catalyst and substrate concentrations and one-half order with respect to dioxygen con- centration. The oxidations yielded epoxide as the only product in all cases; these were identified and analysed by GLC technique. Based on the kinetics, a mechanism involving homolytic cleavage of the 0 0 (peroxo) bond with concerted transfer of the oxygen atom to the substrate was proposed. The presence of methyl group on the cyclohexene ring (reaction 2) and an increase m the number of carbon atoms in the ring for cyclooctene (reaction 3) cause a decrease in the rates of epoxidation. The rate of epoxide formation and the corresponding yields for reactions (1), (2) and (3) decreases in the order: cyclohexene > methylcyclohexene > cyclooctene. Introduction The catalytic oxidation of organic substances in the liquid phase constitutes one of the important types of industrial chemical reactions [1-4]. The study of their mechanisms is important for the creation of new selective processes for the synthesis of a desired product [5,6]. The selective epoxidation of olefins constitutes one such reaction [7-12]. In the options available to date for oxygenations catalyzed by transition metal complexes of Groups 3d, 4d and 5d, the oxidants are restricted to oxygen atom transfer agents such as HgOg, iodosylbenzene [13-20] and peroxyacids [21,22]. Catalytic oxygen atom transfer reactions that are performed directly with molecular oxygen as the oxidant have been little studied [23-25]. The *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/90/$3.50 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed m The Netherlands 266 successful utilization of Ru(III) EDTA as catalyst m a number of oxygen atom transfer reactions [26-30] prompted us to try the simple [RuClgdIgO^]\"1\" ion, stable and dominant in the pH range 2.0-2.5 [31], as the catalyst for the epoxidation of olefins in mixed solvent systems. In the present paper we report the epoxidation of cyclohexene, methyl- cyclohexene and cis-cyclooctene by molecular oxygen using [RuClgdIzO^]'1' as the catalyst at pH 2.00 in HgO dioxane medium at 35 C(jU=0.1 M(KNOa)). Experimental Materials and methods A stock solution of rutheniumdll) (0.01 M) was prepared in l M hydrochloric acid by dissolving the appropriate amount of ruthenium trichlor- ide trihydrate (RuCla^HgO) obtained from Johnson Matthey Inc. The solution thus prepared was allowed to stand at room temperature for 3-4 days, allowing the monomeric chloro complexes to reach equilibrium. The ruthenium content in this solution (0.01 M) was estimated by the known spectrophotometric method. The values were also checked by comparison with those of a standard rutheniumdll) solution (AAS) supplied by Aldrich Chemical Co. All the chemicals used for testing and standardisation studies were of analytical grade, and the solutions were prepared with double- distilled water. The substrates, namely 1-methylcyclohexene and cyclooctene of analytical grade (A.R.), were obtained from BDH and purified prior to use by the published procedure [32]. Cyclohexene was prepared by the known method [33] and freed from peroxides by washing with acidified ferrous sulphate, dried over calcium chloride and distilled under inert atmosphere. Double-distilled A.R. grade 1,4-dioxane was used as a cosolvent to prepare fresh solutions of cyclohexene, methylcyclohexene, and cyclooctene for each experimental run. The ionic strength of all the solutions was maintained at 0.1 M using A.R. grade KNOs as a supporting electrolyte. All pH measure- ments were made with a Digisun Model Digital pH meter readable to 0.01 pH. The absorption spectra were recorded on a Beckman Model DU-7 high speed UV-Vis spectrophotometer. In the kinetic measurements, the apparatus consisted of a manometer, burette and two double-walled glass cells containing a reference and experimental reaction mixture, respectively [34]. Stability measurements The stability constants for the formation of metal-olefin complex were determined spectrophotometrically at 35 C by the reported method [35]. The stoichiometry of these complexes was determined by spectrophotometric titration. Increasing amounts of olefin, with varying concentrations, were added to flasks containing a fixed concentration of the metal ion solution. The absorbances at equilibrium at the wavelength of maximum absorption of 267 metal-olefin complex of reaction mixtures were recorded in order to estimate the stoichiometric ratio and also the stability constants of various metal olefin complexes. Instrumentation The substrates and their corresponding epoxides were analysed on a Shimadzu gas Chromatograph GC-9A assembled with a stainless-steel column containing 10% Carbowax 20 M on 90-100 mesh Anakrom. A thermal conductivity detector at 200 C using helium as carrier gas was used for product analysis. Synthetic standards of the oxidised products of the substrates were used to identify the reaction products under identical experimental conditions at a column temperature of 175 \"C. Area normalisa- tion was employed to calculate the percentage yields of the epoxide formed. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu IR-435 instrument for the characterisation of the products formed. The proton NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL FX100 NMR spectrometer with tetramethylsilane as the standard. The electrochemical measurements were made with PAR electro- chemical instruments equipped with a high precision X-Y recorder (PAR RE 0089). Cyclic voltammetry measurements were carried out with the help of a PAR Model 175 universal programmer. The three-electrode measurements were carried out with a PAR 303 SMDE assembly provided with a glassy carbon working electrode, a platinum wire auxiliary electrode, and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Kinetic/rate measurements The rate constants of the oxidation reaction were derived by following the kinetics of oxygen absorption by the manometric technique. The rate of absorption of oxygen was measured using a glass manometric apparatus provided with leak-proof Springham stopcocks. High-vacuum silicone grease was applied to stopcocks to keep the system airtight. The temperature of the reaction mixture was maintained constant by circulating water at the desired temperature ( 0.1 C) through the jacketted glass cells. The system was evacuated and filled with oxygen several times to ensure that a complete oxygen atmosphere prevails in the reaction cell. Molecular oxygen was presaturated with water vapour by streaming through a wash-bottle containing an electrolyte concentration identical to that of the reaction solution. The substrates were dissolved in sufficient quantities of dioxane to maintain a 1:1 water dioxane ratio in the reaction mixture. In order to minimize the effect of solvent vapour, a blank was run simultaneously under the same conditions of temperature, pressure and volume. The absorption of dioxygen was measured manometrically by noting the change in the levels of the indicator solution in the measuring burette at suitable time intervals. In order to obtain the desired partial pressure of molecular oxygen, mixtures of dioxygen and nitrogen varying in composition, as well as pure dioxygen, were employed. The solubility of molecular oxygen 268 in solution at 1.0 atm was determined from physical data on the solubility of molecular oxygen. The data at other partial pressures were computed from the solubility data at 1.0 atm pressure of molecular oxygen. Results Solution chemistry studies Studies on the aqueous solution chemistry of ruthenium(III) ion over a wide range of acidic pH were carried out by means of spectrophotometric and electrochemical techniques. The distribution of various chloro complexes of rutheniumdll) chloride in aqueous solution in the pH range 0.4-2.0 has been reported earlier [31]. The various rutheniumdll) chloro species existing in solution in the said pH range were identified as [RuCVHaO)^\", [RuCladiaOa], [RuCWsO)4^ and [RuCKHzOJ^. With the help of the equilibrium data available [31], it is possible to calculate the concentration of a particular rutheniumdll) species present in solution at a particular pH. Thus, in the present studies carried out at pH 2.0, [RuCladIaC^]'1\" is the predominant species (>90%) present m solution and was thus assumed as the catalytic species involved in the oxidation of cyclohexene, methyl- cyclohexene and cyclooctene at pH 2.00. Kinetic studies The epoxidation of cyclohexene, 1-methylcyclohexene and cyclooctene by molecular oxygen was first studied with respect to the variation of concentra- tion of [RuCladIgC^] catalyst keeping the concentration of the other 0 (U 0-8 1-2 1-6 2-0 2'A [RU (ill)] X1Q3, M Fig. 1.

Stoichiometric studies and product analysis Oxygen uptake measurements and the results of product analysis indicate the following Stoichiometric equations for rutheniumdll) ion- catalysed epoxidation of cyclohexene (reaction (1)), methylcyclohexene (reaction (2)) and cyclooctene (reaction (3)) by molecular oxygen. CeHio+iOg -^ CeHioO (1) CeHgCHa+iOa -^ 0^(0)0^ (2) CgHM+eOa -^ CsH^O (3) From the stoichiometry of reactions (1), (2) and (3), it is evident that the molecularity of dioxygen is 0.5, which means that for every mole of substrate involved, one-half mole of dioxygen is required for the formation of the epoxide. Reactions (1), (2) and (3) are thus examples of a homodioxygenase system, in which both the oxygen atoms of dioxygen are eventually trans- ferred to two substrate molecules to give two molecules of product at the end of the catalytic cycle. The oxidised products were extracted with ether from the solution containing rutheniumdll) catalyst and subjected to GLC analysis which indicated neat and exclusive epoxidation of the olefins cyclohexene, cyclo- octene and methyl cyclohexene to their respective epoxides. The IR spectrum of the products exhibited three bands at 1250, 900 and 800 cm\"1 which represent the characteristic peaks of epoxide. The proton NMR spectra of the oxidised products show a peak at 2.9 ppm, suggesting formation of the epoxide. The quantitative yields of the epoxide formed in all the reactions are given in Table 5. Discussion Based on the kinetic results, stoichiometry and product analysis, a general and common mechanism is proposed for rutheniumdll) ion- catalysed epoxidation of cyclohexene, 1-methylcyclohexene and cyclooctene by molecular oxygen as depicted in Scheme 1, which involves homolytic 273 [Ru\"(^l;,0)^Cl2]++)==( ^L [ci^H^OlgRii1-^]'1' 2[cl2(^^20)3Ru\"--)(]++0;, ^ [d^H^Ol^ P\"\";. ^Ru''(H20)2Cl2]2+ (A- 2 \\^ ^- [C4(H,0),R^ j^H^Cl,]24 JH20 \\ / \\ / r in 12 + /C <\\ +[Ru(H;,0)^Cl2J Scheme 1.

In the proposed mechanism (Scheme 1), the pre-equilibrium step (K^) involves the formation ofRu(III)-olefin complex, two moles of which combine with one mole of dioxygen forming a ^-peroxo-bridged complex as defined by step Kf. In the rate-determining step (k ), overlap of a filled ^-orbital of the peroxo oxygen atom with the empty JI* orbital of olefin causes homolytic cleavage of the 0 0 bond with the formation of an oxetane intermediate (Scheme 1), which cleaves to give the product and the catalyst. The epoxidation is stereospecific in that cis-cyclooctene gives the cis-epoxide, supporting the oxetane intermediate. Evaluation of rate parameters Based on kinetic observations and the mechanism proposed, the following common rate expression is derived for ruthenium(III) ion-catalysed epoxidation of cyclohexene, methylcyclohexene and cyclooctene by dioxygen in 1:1 water-dioxane solvent: ^'^^A-i^snRuaiimoa]172 (4) dt The above rate equation is subjected to steady state and equilibrium conditions, where the concentration of the catalyst is expressed in terms of its total concentration [Ru111^ by taking into consideration the amount of rutheniumdll) present in the intermediate complexes. -dCOg] kKiK^SWu^W1'2 at 1 +2I-JS] +KlKalSi[0^1/2 (5) For the evaluation of rate constant (k ) and equilibrium constants (.Ki and Kz), the rate expression (5) is subsequently rearranged to give the following 274 rate law: [RU^T ^ ______ -dIO^/dt kK^iSWs]1'2 'kK^O^'^k + 1 -,+T (6) With the help of the above rate law (eqn. (6)), the values of equilibrium constants Ki and Ks and the value of the rate constant k were determined. Values of equilibrium constants for reactions (1), (2) and (3) are given in Tables 4 and 5, respectively. From the relative values of rate constants for the slow step (k ) in the reactions catalysed by Ru(III) ion, it is obvious that the rate of transfer of both the oxygen atoms to two coordinated olefin molecules by the homolytic deavage of the peroxo bond is two times faster for reaction (1) as compared to reaction (2), about five times faster than reaction (3). Reactions (1), (2) and (3) represent a model homodioxygenase system in which both dioxygen atoms are simultaneously incorporated into two substrate molecules, giving rise to two product molecules. The epoxidation of cyclohexene by Ru(III) ion is much faster as compared to that of 1-methylcyclohexene and cyclooctene. This is attributed to the fact that the presence of a methyl substituent in the ring makes it bulkier, causing a steric hindrance during the orientation of the reactant molecules into proper position while complexing with the metal ion. This is reflected in the values of the equilibrium constants (Table 4) wherein 1-methylcyclohexene forms a relatively less stable complex with ruthenium as compared to cyclohexene. The corresponding dioxygen complex with the former is subsequently less stable than the latter. The difference in equilibrium constants for cyclohexene and cyclooctene can be attributed to the ring size of the olefins.

The rate constants (Table 5) also indicate the fact that reaction (1) is faster than reaction (2), which in turn is faster than reaction (3), a fact also reflected in the percentage yield of epoxide formed (Table 5) in reactions (1), (2) and (3).

Bhatt R.R. Merchant Discipline of Coordination Chemistry and Homogeneous Catalysis, Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research Institute, Bhavnagar 364 002 India 1 Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. Kinetics of the epoxidation of cyclohexene, methylcyclohexene and cis-cyclooctene by molecular oxygen catalysed by Ru(III) ion, [RuCl2H(2O)4]+ at pH 2.0 in a mixed water-dioxane solvent medium are reported. The reactions were studied manometrically as a function of catalyst, substrate and dioxygen concentrations. For all the substrates studied, the rate of oxidation is first order with respect to catalyst and substrate concentrations and one-half order with respect to dioxygen concentration. The oxidations yielded epoxide as the only product in all cases; these were identified and analysed by GLC technique. Based on the kinetics, a mechanism involving homolytic cleavage of the O-O (peroxo) bond with concerted transfer of the oxygen atom to the substrate was proposed. The presence of methyl group on the cyclohexene ring (reaction 2) and an increase in the number of carbon atoms in the ring for cyclooctene (reaction 3) cause a decrease in the rates of epoxidation. The rate of epoxide formation and the corresponding yields for reactions (1), (2) and (3) decreases in the order: cyclohexene > methylcyclohexene > cyclooctene. References 1 L.F. Fieser M.
