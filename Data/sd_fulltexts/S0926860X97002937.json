The poison stability was investigated by examining the catalysts in deep oxidation of methane (1 vol% in air) in the presence of SO2 (0.05 vol%). The alumina-manganese oxide catalyst was found to be the most resistant to overheating. It lowered the activity in deep methane oxidation ~2.5 times only after calcination at 950 for 800 h. The more poison stable samples were found to be alumina-palladium and perovskite (on the base of LaMnO3) catalysts. The activity of more thermostable alumina-manganese oxide catalyst is lowered up to zero activity in deep oxidation of methane at 500. But at reaction temperature 700 the catalyst is sufficiently stable to poisoning. ~ 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction One may define catalyst service life as a period of time when its main parameters remain unchanged. For the deep oxidation (combustion) catalysts such para- meters are their activity and strength. The activity and strength survival during the long catalyst operation depend on the catalyst resistance to thermal shocks and poisoning. These properties are of a key importance for the catalysts that participate in the combustion of fuels or VOC concentrated gas emissions [1]. They are also of importance for the catalysts that work in a periodically *Corresponding author. changing temperature field, as it occurs, when gases are purified using the reverse processes [2]. Indeed, in the latter case temperature in the catalyst bed can change from the maximum (800-1000) to the mini- mum (inlet) (20-100). Such conditions are realized when reverse process is used for catalytic combustion of methane in ventilation gas from coal mines with heat utilization [3]. The gas mixture often contains catalytic poisons, mainly, SO2 which can be originally in the gas form during deep oxidation. Therefore, our purpose is to compare how the selected catalysts for deep oxidation resist thermal shocks and such poison as SO2. Note, however, that at high temperatures catalyst poisoning becomes less intensive. With this regard, 0926-860X/98/$19.00 ~i) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

On the other hand, the high-temperature level in reverse reactor can be easily regulated. 2. Experimental methods and results Table 1 characterizes the catalysts studied for com- parison. Alumina-manganese oxide catalyst (Mn-AI) was prepared via the incipient impregnation of 7- alumina granules with the manganese nitrate solution. Thus the obtained catalyst was dried at 120 for 6 h and then calcined at ~950 for 6 h [4]. Alumina-copper-chromite oxide catalyst (Cu-Cr- A1) was extruded from a paste, mainly consisting of a plasticized aluminium hydroxide (pseudoboehmite structure), basic cupric carbonate and chromium tri- oxide. After drying at room temperature for 12 h and then at 120 for 4 h, the catalyst was calcinated at 500 for 6 h and at ~700 for 7 h [5]. Perovskite, LaMnO3 based catalyst (La-Mn), was prepared by Isupova [6], using mechanochemical activation of precursors and extrusion. Alumina-palladium catalyst (Pd-A1) was obtained by chemisorption on -y-alumina from palladium nitrate solution. Starting sample (0, 25% Pd) was preliminary calcined in air for 4 h at ~500. The catalysts were shaped as rings (outer diameter- 15 mm, inner diameter - 10ram, ring height - 15 ram). For thermal resistance tests, catalysts were first calcined in air at 750 for 10 h, then at 900c'C for 6 h. The activity of thus calcined catalysts was determined in the deep butane oxidation at 400 in a flow-circular installation. Note, that the deep oxidation of butane have been accepted recently [7] as a model reaction for testing catalysts on a mass scale. Inlet butane concentration was 0.2 vol%, butane concentration in the circulation loop (and outlet) being 0.1 vol%. The volume rate of circulation was 50-100 times higher than the inlet flow volume rate. Owing to that there are no temperature or concentration gradi- ents in catalyst layer. The activity is presented as cm3(SPT) of n-butane/g of catalyst/s. The test results are presented in Table 1. Mn-AI and Pd-A1 samples were then tested for thermal resistance. They were calcined at 950 in air for 808 h. Periodically taken catalyst samples were studied for phase composition, specific surface and activity in a model reaction of deep methane oxidation (flow- circular method). The choice of methane oxi- dation as a model reaction is connected with catalyst selection for practical goal-combustion of methane from mine ventilation gas. This reaction was per- formed at 500, inlet methane concentration being 0.5 vol%, methane concentration in the loop being 0.25 vol%. Fig. 1 shows the conditions of a periodic temperature treatment of the catalysts during 800 h. Fig. 2 reflects the dynamics of catalyst activity (cm3 (SPT) of methane/g of catalyst/s). The effect of SO2 on the catalyst activity was studied in the deep oxidation of methane in the flow setup, inlet CH4 and SO2 concentrations in air being 1.0 and 0.05 vol%, respectively. The volume rate of gas mixture was 85 1/h. The weighed portions of catalysts were chosen so that the conversion of methane was <20%. Each catalyst (fraction 2- 3 mm) was mixed with inert (quartz, the same frac- Table 1 Composition, thermal stability and strength of the studied catalysts No. Catalyst (composition) Thermal stability Strength Specific surface (mZ/g) N (ram) Wo a 102 W750 ~ 10~- Wgoo a 102 initial final 1 AI-Mn, 10 tool% MnOJA1203 0.9 0.9 1.2 3.5 70 7 2 AI-Pd, 0.25 mass% Pd/AI203 1.0 1.8 0.4 3.1 200 7 3 La-Mn, perovskite type 1.3 0.9 0.7 4.0 70 26 4 Cu-Cr-A1 CuCr204/7-AI203 0.6 0.4 0.3 3.7 88 26 a Wo, W75o, Wgoo are the rates of butane oxidation on the granules of industrial size (in cm3/g/s) for the samples before calcination (Wo) and after calcination at 750 (10 h) and 900 (6 h) respectively.

The reactor (quartz tube, length 20cm, inner diameter 2.5 cm) was immersed in a furnace with fluidized sand bed for securing the isothermic conditions in catalyst layer. The necessary temperature in reactor was given and controlled by isothermal regulator R-133 provided with chromel-alumel thermocouple. The initial con- version of methane was measured using the gas mix- ture without SO2. The reaction rate was determined: W=CinXXX U/g, where Cin is the inlet concentration of methane, X the methane conversion, U the flow rate, and g the mass of catalyst.

Catalyst resistance to the high-temperature calcination The results of the investigation are presented in Table 1. The Mn-A1 catalyst shows the best thermal resistance. Moreover, the calcination at 900 increases its activity, and that is the characteristic feature of the aluminum-manganese oxide system, since at 900-1000 the clusters of defect spinel phase Mn304+x and high-temperature alumina phases, mainly corundum, are formed [4]. This defect spinel is the catalytically active structure, dispersed on the corundum surface. The phase genesis of Mn-AI cata- lyst is connected with the formed solid solution manganese oxide-'~-alumina at temperature interval 500-800. The decomposition of this solid solution on reaching 900 results in the formation of corun- dum and dispersive particles of above mentioned spinel, which is responsible for thermoactivation effect [4]. Note, that the interaction between manga- nese oxide and 0'-alumina lowers the phase transfor- mation temperature of \"/-alumina to corundum by ~200. Pd-alumina catalyst (Pd-A1) also gains in activity for 1 g of catalyst after calcination at 750. Earlier we have shown [9] that calcination at high tempera- tures (750 and more) decreases the dispersity of palladium or platinum in Pt(or Pd)-alumina catalysts for deep oxidation, but the specific activity (per m2 or surface atom) of Pt(Pd) increases. The raise in specific activity can compensate the decrease in supported metal dispersity and, as a whole, the catalyst activity per 1 g increases. The probable reasons for the rise of specific activity are that the influence of negative t~ G.

The dynamics of catalysts activity ~ I ' I ' I 6 8 Time, h 10 in the presence of SO2 (T=500 ~C). support (due to acceptor properties of 7-alumina) becomes less essential, as the active component crys- tals grow, and the catalytic activity of PdO on the alumina surface is smaller than that on the surface of comparatively large metal palladium crystals [10]. The massive perovskite catalyst (La-Mn) loses its activity mainly due to the sintering of its active sur- face. In a similar manner, after calcination at 900, the surface of Cu-Cr-A1 catalyst reduces by 3.5-fold. Moreover, the amount of less active solid solution CuA1204-A1203 and phase c~-Cr203 in the catalyst increases [51. The samples Mn-AI and Pd-A1 underwent to a more hard test (compare data plotted in Table 1 and in Figs. 1 and 2). Apparently, at first Mn-A1 is acti- vated when calcined at 900. Then its activity decreases and stabilizes at approximately 50% of the initial one. After 37 h of calcination at 950 the catalyst phase composition consists mainly of phase c~-A1203 and well crystallized spinel Mn304. It is of importance that during calcination (more than 800 h) the size of spinel coherent scattering region (c.s.r.) does not change and is close to 60 A. Catalyst specific surface reduces from 5 mZ/g (48 h at 950) to 3 m2/g (808 h). This tendency has no effect on the steady-state activity, since according to the X-ray phase analysis data the active component dispersity does not change. The good sintering resis- tance is connected with strong interaction between spinel crystallites and support. Then the mutual diffu- sion of manganese and aluminum cations under higher temperatures (1000-1100) results in the formation of spinel solid solution on the base of MnAI204. Pd-A1 catalyst, which initially is very active in the deep oxidation of methane, loses its activity by an order of magnitude. The activities of Mn-A1 and Pd-A1 catalysts become equal after 800 h when they are calcined at 950. The phase composition of the Pd-A1 catalyst changes slower than that of the Mn-A1 catalyst. Thus 36 I~G. Ts'vndnikov et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 167 (1998) 31 37 e9 % 10 ' I ' I 0 2 4 ' I ' I ' I 6 8 10 Time, h Fig. 4. The dynamics of Mn-A1 activity in the presense of SO2. after 37 h of calcination, alumina is represented by a mixture of phases: 7-A1203 and ~-A1203. Palladium compounds are shown as a small peak corresponding to an interplane distance of 2.64 A (PdO). After 500 h of calcination this peak disappears, and a small shoulder appears at 0=40.4that may be ascribed to metal palladium. Since the catalyst in concern relates to the 'egg-shell' type catalysts, and palladium concentration in the outer layer of catalyst rings is much higher than in the bulk, we performed the following experiment. We moved off the outer part from some catalysts rings and, using the X-ray ana- lysis, studied the outer part of the sample calcined for 808 h at 950. The diffraction pattern obtained shows the peaks that relate to metal palladium, the size of c.s.r, being d>400 A. Such an increase of the particle size initially from 40-60 A (determined using hydrogen chemisorption on the reduced samples) to 400 A explains well the decrease of the catalyst activity during the high-temperature calcination. 3.2. Catalyst resistance to poisoning Fig. 3 shows the dynamics of catalysts activity in the deep oxidation of methane at 500 in the sulfur dioxide presence. Apparently, perovskite (La-Mn) and (Pd-A1) catalysts are most resistant to SO2, while Mn-A1 is the less resistant one. The dynamic poisoning curves have several 'steps' as a rule, probably caused by the groups of active sites differing by their resistances to SO2 and activity. Since Mn-A1 catalyst appears to be the most ther- mally stable and thus can be operated at high tem- peratures, it was of importance to know how combustion conditions, temperature in particular, could influence its resistance to poisons and check its possible recovery. For this purpose, we used the simplest way of the poisoned catalyst calcination in the air flow. Fig. 4 shows the dynamics of Mn-A1 poisoning as compared to that of Cu-Cr-A1 at the reaction tern- P.G. Tsyrulnikov et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 167 (1998) 31-37 37 perature of 700. Obviously, catalyst poisoning occurs slower at 500 (see Fig. 3). Most likely, the stability of surface 'sulfates' that poison the catalyst decreases, as the temperature grows from 500 to 700. However, sulfur dioxide produces sur- face sulfates not only via reaction (I): (MnO)s + SO2 + 1/202 ---, (MnSO4)s (I) but also via reaction (II), when SO2 reduces manga- nese ion valence to II without oxygen: (MnOl 5), + 802 --+ (MnSO4)s (II) This reaction results in the decomposition of active structure in Mn-A1 catalyst. The peaks at 20=36 32 5(1'; 31 290' correspond to the nonstoichiometric defective spinel and they disappear almost completely after poisoning for 4 h. But peaks, characterized bulk manganese sulfate (20=33 327';), appear only after repeated poisoning of completely regenerated catalyst. Note, that the repeated poisoning proceeds slower than the first. These facts need explanation, which will be done in following work. As the process temperature increases to 900, sulfur containing compounds decompose, and the catalyst recovers its activity. Table 2 presents the XPS data for the fresh catalyst, the catalyst poisoned at 500, and for the recovered catalyst. 6+ The data prove that most intensively S -containing surface compounds are formed during the first two hours of the reaction performance. This period coin- cides with that of the sharp activity decrease. In the totally deactivated catalyst half of the manganese atoms in the subsurface layers is fixed in the surface sulfates. However, our regeneration method allows us to remove SO2 from the catalyst surface and thus recover the catalyst activity. 4. Conclusions The comparative study of various catalysts shows that Mn-A1 catalyst is the most resistant to overheat- ing. During the 800 h of calcination at 950, its activity is stabilized at 5-10-fold higher level than that of the reference oxide catalysts. Sulfur dioxide present in the gas flow poisons the catalyst at 500. As the temperature increases to 700, the catalyst resistance to poison increases to that of the Cu-Cr-A1 catalyst. The calcination of Mn-A1 catalyst in the air flow at 900 recovers the catalyst activity. At present, Mn-A1 catalyst is produced as industrial batches at Katalizator, Novosibirsk, Russia.

        "dc:description": "The activity of catalysts before and after heat treatment up to 950°C was measured in model reactions of methane and butane deep oxidation. The poison stability was investigated by examining the catalysts in deep oxidation of methane (1 vol% in air) in the presence of SO2 (0.05 vol%). The alumina-manganese oxide catalyst was found to be the most resistant to overheating. It lowered the activity in deep methane oxidation ∼2.5 times only after calcination at 950°C for 800 h. The more poison stable samples were found to be alumina-palladium and perovskite (on the base of LaMnO3) catalysts. The activity of more thermostable alumina-manganese oxide catalyst is lowered up to zero activity in deep oxidation of methane at 500°C. But at reaction temperature 700°C the catalyst is sufficiently stable to poisoning.",
