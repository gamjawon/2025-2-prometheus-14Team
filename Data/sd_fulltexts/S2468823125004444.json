Production of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) from abundant sugars is essential for establishing sustainable and eco-friendly biomass chemicals synthesis route, considering its application as a key intermediate for renewable fuels and chemicals. Here in, we report that the conversion of glucose to HMF was significantly facilitated by cooperation of photothermal effect and active sites among the ternary composite catalyst (Co-MoOx/PW/SiO2 NH2). The reaction temperature of DMSO solution could be maintained at ∼100 °C based on the cobalt-doped molybdenum oxide/phosphotungstic acid (Co-MoOx/PW) photothermal-catalyst, which results in an excellent HMF yield of 71.04 % in 8 h under 450 nm LED (50 W) irradiation. In addition, the amino group on the surface of silica preferentially reacts with the aldehyde group of glucose to form a Schiff base structure, which is converted to glycosamine with a cyclic structure, and then the intermediate fast convert to HMF by a dehydration step. This novel conversion route avoids the sluggish process of isomerization of glucose to fructose during the production of HMF, also offers a strategy to design the multi-functional green photothermal-catalytic system to synthesize biomass derivatives that have not previously been considered. Graphical abstract A Co-MoOx/PW/SiO2 NH2 ternary composite catalyst was developed, integrating photothermal effects with acid-base cooperative catalysis. By integrating light energy utilization, green solvent exploration, and catalyst recycling, it offers a novel approach for the sustainable synthesis of biomass-derived platform molecules. Image, graphical abstract Keywords Photothermal Catalysis Glucose 5-hydroxymethylfurfural Schiff base 1 Introduction HMF, derived from dehydration of six-carbon sugars, is a pivotal multifunctional molecule due to the presence of functional groups such as C = O, CO, and furan rings [1,2]. It is designated by the US Department of Energy as one of the top ten biomass-based compounds with utmost preparation priority [3]. The current challenge for production of HMF is to enhance the economics of industrial-scale production and conversion efficiency. The yield of HMF from expensive ketose (fructose) can reach up to 94 % [4], while HMF produced from cheap and abundant aldose (glucose) is only with a yield of ∼ 60–70 % at 150–200 °C, even it catalyzed by the strong Brønsted acid [5–7]. Therefore, the development of mild and economic catalysts to improve the conversion efficiency from glucose is a prerequisite for the economic industrialization production of HMF. It has been reported that both the two distinct steps for the conversion of glucose to HMF were prompted by acid catalysts: the isomerization of aldose (glucose) to ketose (fructose) by Lewis acid and the dehydration reaction of ketose to HMF in the presence of Brønsted acid [8,9]. In general, the isomerization of glucose to fructose is thought as the rate-limiting step in the process of the conversion from glucose to HMF, because the competing epimerization of glucose to mannose also occurred in upon the acid catalysts except the isomerization of glucose to fructose (as shown in Scheme 1 ) [10]. The mutual transformation among these sugar molecules would delay the whole conversion process. Recently, Brønsted bases, such as organic amine molecules, have been employed for the isomerization of glucose to fructose to avoid the side reaction [11–13]. Zhang et al. found that organosilanes amine loading on the supporter have higher catalytic activity than aliphatic amines [14], the yield of converting glucose to fructose increased to 32 % at 100 °C [15]. Those work supplied helpful insight to find new strategy to isomerization of glucose to fructose except under strong acidic condition. On the other hand, HMF is prone to decomposition into other products, such as levulinic acid and formic acid, at elevated temperatures (>150 °C) [16]. The catalyst that works at mild reaction temperature will minimize by-products and reduce energy consumption [17]. So far, a lot of effort has been devoted on it. For example, by using complexes composed of Al3+ and fulvic acid as a Lewis acid and photosensitizer, the reaction temperature could be adjusted to 80 °C under the irradiation of 440 ± 5 nm LED light, but the yield of ∼60 % for HMF was achieved. The yield of HMF is much higher than that obtained at 80 °C only by thermal catalysis [18]. It means that the light-enhanced acid catalysis could play an important role in the dehydration step. In fact, photo-induced thermal effect based on the photo-thermal catalysts has also attracted attention in biomass conversion [19–21]. Li et al. reported that the cleavage of β−1,4-glycosidic bonds of cellobiose under mild condition was attributed to a cooperation effect between the acid catalysis of HY zeolite and Ir nanoparticles as a plasmonic photothermal source [22]. Therefore, the combination of photocatalysis with conventional acid catalysis as well as photothermal effect may provide a superior method for the conversion of glucose to HMF under mild reaction conditions. Here, we constructed a photothermal-responded Co-MoOx/PW composite acid catalyst with the amino-modified silica nanoparticles (SiO2 NH2) as co-catalysts, which realized the photothermal synergistic catalytic conversion of glucose to HMF at mild conditions. A 450 nm LED (50 W) was employed as the light source, and the yield of HMF reached at 71.04 % within 8 h without the additional heat source. It provides a helpful insight for the design and application of multi-functional catalysts for the tangled chemical transformation. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Preparation of photocatalysts All chemicals were analytically pure and used without further purification. The catalysts preparation process is similar to the Ref [23,24]. Preparation of Co-MoOx/PW: A solution was prepared by dispersing 0.2964 g of (NH4)6Mo7O24–4H2O, 0.7000 g of glycine, 0.3385 g of phosphotungstic acid hydrate and 0.0340 g of cobalt tetrahydrate acetate into 60 mL of deionized water. A solution of 0.72 mL hydrochloric acid was added dropwise to the aforementioned solution, while stirring. Following 15 min stirring period, the sample was transferred to a 100 mL hydrothermal autoclave and heated at 180 °C for a further 10 h. Upon completion of the heating process, the sample was separated by filtration, washed three times with deionized water, and dried at 60 °C. Preparation of SiO2 NH2 : 200 mg of silicon dioxide was dispersed in 40 mL of anhydrous ethanol, and 120 μL of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane was added dropwise with stirring at room temperature for 12 h. The sample was separated by filtration, washed several times with anhydrous ethanol and water alternately, and dried at room temperature. 2.2 Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer at a scan rate of 2° min-1 under Cu Kα radiation. Infrared spectroscopy-related tests were conducted using a Nicolet iS50, while X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) tests were performed with a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha instrument. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, SU8220) was employed to characterize the morphology and microstructure of the samples. The light absorption properties were evaluated using a Hitachi U-3010 UV–visible spectrophotometer, with BaSO4 employed as the reference material. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were obtained using a Bruker EMX NANO Desktop electron paramagnetic resonator. Finally, the photoluminescence spectra (PL) were conducted using a Hitachi F-4600. A Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS50 instrument was used for in-situ Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) measurements. The dome of the reaction cell was equipped with three windows, two of which were KBr windows designed for IR transmission. The third window was used for light source transmission to drive the catalytic reaction. The spectra were displayed in the transmission mode and obtained with a resolution of 4 cm-1 through 64 scans. Subsequently, the data were processed and analyzed by Thermo Scientific OMNIC software. The specific test steps of the in-situ FT-IR measurement was as follows: Firstly, the catalyst powder (40 mg of Co-MoOx/PW, 80 mg of SiO2 NH2) was impregnated in a 12 ml DMSO solution containing 1.5 % glucose in the dark for 30 min, followed by filtration of the solution to obtain the sample for infrared characterization. The sample was placed in an in-situ reaction cell and then the cell was sealed. Purity N2 was simultaneously introduced into the reaction cell. Next, the 450 nm LED light source was turned on to measure each key intermediate and its changes during the catalytic process. Finally, the FT-IR spectra were recorded as a function of time to investigate the dynamics of the products adsorption in the dark and conversion under irradiation. 2.3 Photothermal catalysis measurement The photothermal catalysis experiments were conducted in a 100 mL flat-bottomed flask. The initial step involved the addition of 20 mg of Co-MoOx/PW, 40 mg of SiO2 NH2, 6 mL of DMSO, and 100 mg of anhydrous glucose to the flask. Subsequently, the mixed liquids were subjected to sonication in order to achieve a homogeneous dispersion. During this process, N2 was continuously passed through the system in order to exclude the potential influence of oxygen on the reaction. The reaction was conducted under magnetic stirring with an LED (50 W, 399mW/cm2 (measured from 1 cm distance)) light source at a wavelength of 450 nm for 8 h. One port of the three-necked flask was connected to a condenser tube, while the remaining port was plugged and inserted into an exhaust pipe for N2 venting. The solution was diluted to 1/100, and the test conditions were as follows: the mobile phases were sulfuric acid (70 %) with a pH of 2.5 and methanol (30 %), the flow rate of the mobile phase was 0.5 mL min-1, the column temperature was 30 °C, and the wavelength of the VWD light source was 210 nm. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structure and morphology The crystal structures, compositions of the Co-MoOx/PW catalyst as well as the SiO2 NH2 catalyst were exhibited in the SI section (Fig. S1-S5). As shown in the SEM images (Fig. S1), the morphology of Co-MoOx/PW sample is nanorod with diameter of ∼5 nm and a length of 50–200 nm. According to the XRD pattern and XPS spectra of the samples (Fig. S2 and S3), the synthesized Co-MoOx/PW catalyst is a composite of cobalt-doped oxygen-deficient molybdenum oxide bonded with phosphotungstic acid (PW) by amino acid molecules. The oxygen vacancies and Mo5+ in the catalyst were confirmed by the XPS spectra (Fig. S3 a, d) and EPR spectrum (Fig. S4) [25,26]. In Fig. 1a , the Co-MoOx/PW catalyst showsed the obstructive plasmon resonance absorption in the near-infrared region due to the presence of oxygen vacancies [27]. The photothermal performance of the Co-MoOx/PW was characterized by the time-dependent temperature increasement as shown in Fig. 1b. The temperature of the Co-MoOx/PW/DMSO solution would increase to 100 °C in 10 min of light irradiation. It indicated that Co-MoOx/PW had good photothermal conversion ability, which could convert the light into heat and provide energy for the subsequent glucose conversion reaction. The acidity of Co-MoOx/PW was determined by in situ IR spectroscopy by using basic acetonitrile (CD3CN, pKb = 24) as the probe molecule. The Co-MoOx/PW sample was activated at 150 °C and stored in an Ar-filled bottle to avoid the influence of moisture in air before the test. In Fig. S5b, the adsorption of CD3CN on the catalyst gives rise to four v(CN) vibrational bands at 2272, 2288, 2302, and 2313 cm-1, which are attributed to physisorbed CD3CN (∼2272 cm-1) and chemisorbed CD3CN on Lewis-Brøsted acid sites. The Lewis acidity could derive from the Co, Mo and defects sites, and the Brønsted acidity could derive from the terminal-OH groups on PW sites. These acid sites presented in Co-MoOx/PW play a crucial role in the adsorption of glucose and dehydration steps [28]. It is worth to note that the pH value of the solution of Co-MoOx/PW in deionized water was also dependent with the irradiation time. As shown in Fig.1b, the pH of the aqueous solution decreased from 4.6 to 3.7 within 10 min under light irradiation upon the Co-MoOx/PWcatalyst. It suggests that PW (H3PW(VI)12O40) could be reduced to ([H+[PW(V)12O40]4-]) via the photo-induced electron-proton transfer process by the excited Co-MoOx, which increased the acidity of the solution to enhance the dehydration during the glucose conversion. On the contrary, PW (H3PW(VI)12O40) could not be self-reduced to [H+[PW(V)12O40]4-] by irradiating with light of 450 nm, since its absorption band edge is near 378 nm (as shown in Fig. S6). Therefore, the Co-MoOx, as a photoactivate component, enable the potential electron transfer effect on the catalytic performance. 3.2 Photothermal catalyzed glucose conversion The conversion of glucose to HMF was carried out under 450 nm LED irradiation with the Co-MoOx/PW and SiO2 NH2 catalysts. Fig. 2a illustrates the concentration changes of the products during the conversion reaction. The HMF content in the products gradually increased over the reaction time, accompanied by formation of small amounts of furfural (FUR), hydroxymethylfurfuryl acid, and aldehyde furfuryl acid. Fig. 2b demonstrates that glucose conversion reached 85 % within 4 h, but did not increase further with prolonged reaction time. Conversely, the HMF yield increased over time and reached its maximum value (71.04 % yield) at 8 h. Notably, the HMF yield decreased after 8 h, which can be attributed to hydrolysis and polymerization reactions to form humins. Multiphase catalytic conversion reactions are very sensitive to the solvent environment since the various solubility of substrates and products in different solvents, which subsequently affects the mechanism of catalytic reaction and product distribution [29]. Compared to DMSO, GVL is the preferred organic solvent due to its higher solubility for HMF and low toxicity, but GVL has low solubility for glucose, thus additional H2O was required to improve the solubility of glucose in the GVL solution [30]. Therefore, a mixed solution of H2O/GVL was used as a solvent to investigate the effect of solvent on the catalytic performance. Fig. 2c shows the variation of HMF yield with reaction time in the H2O/GVL solution. The yield of HMF reached 58.17 % at 8 h and continuously extent to 57.91 % at 10 h without decreasing. The lower yield of HMF obtained in H2O/GVL solution than that obtained in DMSO solution could be attribute to the difference from reaction temperature. In fact, the temperature of H2O/GVL only reach at 70 °C under photoexcitation (shown in Fig. S7) due to the higher specific heat capacity (CGVL = 2.2 J (kg °C)-1, Cwater = 4.2 × 103 J (kg °C)-1, CDMSO = 2.93 J (kg °C)-1), whereas the DMSO solution can maintain the reaction temperature at 100 °C, which would accelerate the reaction by inputting extra thermal energy. Control experiments were conducted to validate the role of catalysts and light (Table 1 , Entry 1–3). No HMF was detected in the absence of catalysts (Entry 1), and the yield of HMF decreased to 0 without light irradiation (Entry 3), indicating that HMF formed upon a photothermal catalytic conversion. Furthermore, the individual contributions of each component of the catalyst in the catalytic conversion reaction were investigated through a series of control experiments (Table 1, Entry 4–9). When only MoOx or Co-MoOx/PW was added, glucose could be partially converted to HMF, but the yields were 15.74 % and 20.97 % (Entry 6), respectively. It suggests that molybdenum oxide provided Lewis acidic sites to promote the isomerization of glucose, and phosphotungstic acid (PW) provides Brønsted acidic sites to catalyze the dehydration reaction. However, HMF was not detected in the products when only SiO2 NH2 catalyst was added into the reaction (Entry 5). The liquid products were further analyzed using HPLC equipped with a differential refraction detector, revealing that glucose was partially converted with a 12 % conversion, but fructose was not detected in the products. This result may be attributed to the absence of Brønsted acidic sites on the SiO2 NH2, which resulting in the dehydration reaction hardly undergoing. Moreover, increasing the weight ratio of Co-MoOx/PW to SiO2 NH2 to 1:3, the yield of HMF decreased slightly due to the more SiO2 NH2 nanoparticles could block the light absorption (Table 1, Entry 11). By contrasting these reaction results, it implies that the relay catalysis which undergoes a conversion of glucose to the intermediate by SiO2 NH2 and then the intermediates catalyzed by the Co-MoOx/PW to HMF. In addition, as shown in Table 1, Entry 10, the reaction atmosphere exerted a significant influence on the HMF yield. Comparison with the experimental results from the N2 atmosphere, the yield of HMF obtained in the air atmosphere suffered a significant decrease. The side reactions of oxidative decomposition of HMF could be triggered by oxygen in the air. The influence of light intensity on the photothermal catalysis was depicted in Fig. 3a . The yield of HMF exhibited a decrease as the light intensity was reduced, indicating the crucial role of light irradiation in promoting HMF production. When exposed to 400 nm and 427 nm LED irradiation, the HMF yield was comparable to that achieved under 450 nm LED, owing to the similar light response of the Co-MoOx/PW catalyst within the 400∼450 nm range (Fig. 3b). Conversely, when irradiated with 390 nm LED, the HMF yield decreased, and a higher formation of formic acid was observed in the products. This observation suggests that intense UV light leads to the decomposition of HMF into smaller molecules. The synergistic effect between photothermal and solid acid was investigated by the controlled thermal catalytic conversion reaction performed in the dark. The reaction temperature was set at 100 °C, which is close to the temperature induced by photothermal effect. As shown in Fig. 3c, HMF obtained in the thermal catalysis was inferior to that of photothermal catalysis, with a yield of 19.33 % and conversion of 30.43 %. It is clearly that the photothermal catalytic conversion of glucose is more effective than that performed at the same temperature without photocatalytic effect. It suggests that the light irradiation promotes HMF production by enhanced acid catalysis. Moreover, when the reaction temperature increased to 150 °C, the yield of HMF would achieve to 54 % in 1 h, but it would reduce to 39 % at 2 h. The decreased yield would be attributed to the formation of humin-like products resulted from the condensation of HMF and sugars. 3.3 The possible reaction pathway Fig. 4a shows the fluorescence spectra of the complexes formed by glucose and SiO2 NH2. The complexes exhibit strong emission at 475 nm under the excitation of 410 nm due to formation of water-soluble fluorescent silicon nanodots [31]. The corresponding fluorescence of complexes decreased after 120 min irradiation of 450 nm LED, which indicates that the reducible aldehyde group of glucose was converted to the other group under light irradiation. Furtherly, in order to investigate the interaction between the SiO2 NH2 nanoparticles and glucose, in situ IR diffuse reflectance experiments of glucose adsorbed on the surface of SiO2 NH2 was conducted under photoexcitation. Fig. 4b depicts the time-resolved differential infrared spectra of this process. It is evident that a progressively stronger peak corresponding to the C=N bond is observed at 1654 cm-1, accompanied by the appearance of corresponding C=C bands at 1590, 1439, and 1403 cm-1 [32]. In addition, the spectral band corresponding to the Schiff base CH vibration at 2920 cm-1 was also gaining strength. The presence of these characteristic groups indicates that the aldehyde group in the glucose molecule undergoes a Schiff base reaction with the amino group on the surface of the catalyst to produce an intermediate product in the form of a cyclic glucosamine. The intermediate usually can be subject to a cyclic fructosamine via the Amadori rearrangement in an acidic environment, then followed by a multi-step dehydration reaction, resulting in the formation of HMF. In addition, the time-resolved differential FT-IR spectra of glucose under photoexcitation in the catalytic reaction system consisting of Co-MoOx/PW and SiO2 NH2 are presented in Fig. 5 . In comparison to the initial FT-IR spectrum of the reaction, the vibrational peaks corresponding to CO and C1-H in the glucose molecule (1066 cm-1) exhibited a gradual decrease in intensity with the increase in photoexcitation time. In contrast, a series of spectral peaks corresponding to C=C stretching vibrations were observed to be enhanced at 1560, 1507, 1436, and 1404 cm-1. Additionally, =C O-C= ring vibrations were detected at 1224 cm-1, furan ring deformation vibrations were observed at 1020 cm-1, and CH in-plane deformations were detected at 951, 931 cm-1. Furthermore, the new peaks observed at 2916 and 2996 cm-1 were attributed to the stretching vibrations of the methylene groups and side chain methylene groups of the furan ring. The absorption peaks at 2340 and 2361 cm-1 were attributed to CO2 resulted from the decomposition of by-products such as formic acid [33]. The enhanced absorption peaks at 3389 and 3732 cm-1 were attributed to water molecules from dehydration step [34]. Therefore, the variation pattern of this series of infrared characteristic peaks with reaction time was correspond with the reaction course from glucose to glucosamine/fructosamine and then further conversion to HMF. Potential products of glucose isomerization, such as fructose and mannose, were excluded by liquid chromatography. As shown in Fig. S8, the retention times of glucose and fructose were 16.90 min and 20.10 min, respectively, with respective concentrations of 14.66 and 0.057 mg mL-1. The decrease in glucose was considerably more pronounced than the increase in fructose, with the initial concentration of glucose being 16.67 mg mL-1. A distinct signal is also observed at a retention time of 18.91, which is distinct from the possible isomerization products of mannose, xylose, and arabinose. This evidence rules out the possibility that the reaction intermediates are these sugar molecules. 3.4 Expansion of substrates and stability of catalyst The photothermal catalytic conversion of the polysaccharides were performed over the Co-MoOx/PW with SiO2 NH2 catalysts under optimized reaction conditions. Sucrose (a disaccharide composed by glucose) and inulin (a polysaccharides composed by four fructose) were chosen as the substrates (shown in Fig. 6a ). Unlike the glucose, sucrose and inulin possessing larger molecular weights, the acid-catalyzed cleavage of glycosidic bonds between sugar molecules to form fructose prior to further dehydration and then formation of HMF. Fig. 6 provides a comparison for the conversions from sucrose and inulin. The yields of HMF reached at 48.91 % and 50.26 % for the sucrose and inulin, respectively, under photothermal conditions. It means the photothermal catalyst exhibits potential to conversion of polysaccharides to HMF. Fig. 6b illustrates the cycling performance of the catalysts. In the experiments, the used Co-MoOx/PW and SiO2 NH2 were employed as catalysts to assess the recycling performance of the catalysts. The results demonstrated that the performance of the catalysts only slightly decline following repeated usage. This indicates that the catalyst exhibits good stability, allowing the intermediate products to desorb from the catalyst surface, thereby maintaining the catalyst surface's activity. 4 Conclusion In conclusion, a catalyst system comprising of Co-MoOx/PW and SiO2 NH2 demonstrated the ability to convert glucose to HMF with high yield of 71.04 % under light irradiation. Moreover, the catalyst system shows the potential in the conversion of other saccharides to HMF. The photothermal effect and the light-enhanced acidity of the catalyst enabled the efficient conversion of glucose to HMF under mild conditions. A Schiff base structure formed between the aldehyde group of glucose and the amino group of the SiO2 NH2 by an aldol-ammonia condensation reaction. The intermediate was subsequently converted into a stable cyclic osamine through intramolecular cyclization avoiding to isomerizate glucose to fructose, which usually as the rate-limiting step during the conversion of sugar to HMF. The coordination of the photothermal effect and light-enhanced acidity to form efficient photocatalytic complexes is expected to supply insight for designing of efficient and low-cost photocatalysts for biomass conversion under mild conditions.

        "dc:description": "Production of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) from abundant sugars is essential for establishing sustainable and eco-friendly biomass chemicals synthesis route, considering its application as a key intermediate for renewable fuels and chemicals. Here in, we report that the conversion of glucose to HMF was significantly facilitated by cooperation of photothermal effect and active sites among the ternary composite catalyst (Co-MoOx/PW/SiO2 NH2). The reaction temperature of DMSO solution could be maintained at ∼100 °C based on the cobalt-doped molybdenum oxide/phosphotungstic acid (Co-MoOx/PW) photothermal-catalyst, which results in an excellent HMF yield of 71.04 % in 8 h under 450 nm LED (50 W) irradiation. In addition, the amino group on the surface of silica preferentially reacts with the aldehyde group of glucose to form a Schiff base structure, which is converted to glycosamine with a cyclic structure, and then the intermediate fast convert to HMF by a dehydration step. This novel conversion route avoids the sluggish process of isomerization of glucose to fructose during the production of HMF, also offers a strategy to design the multi-functional green photothermal-catalytic system to synthesize biomass derivatives that have not previously been considered.",
