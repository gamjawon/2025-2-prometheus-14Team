Mariscal, J. Soria, M.A. Pena, J.L.G. Fierro* Instituto de Catalisis y Petroleoguimica, CSIC, Campus UAM. Cantoblanco, 28049 Madrid, Spain (Received I I November 1993, revised manuscript received 31 December 1993) Abstract Undoped and Na-doped lead oxides supported on a-A1203 were used in the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) by cofeeding methane and oxygen at atmospheric pressure. In general, the methane conversion increased with increasing Pb-loading but the Cz+ selectivity decreased slightly. Another major effect observed on incorporation of PbO into a-A1203 was the dramatic increase of carbon dioxide with lead content. The combined use of X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed reduction and photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that a certain proportion of Pb'+ species is present in the undoped catalysts, and this is greater for the catalysts with higher lead oxide content. These techniques also revealed that lead oxide is partially evaporated under severe conditions imposed by the OCM, although the evaporation can be diminished by doping with sodium. The beneficial effect of sodium on the catalyst stability is also accompanied by a better catalyst performance due to the ability of sodium oxide to activate methane. Key words: lead oxide; methane oxidative coupling; photoelectron spectroscopy; sodium-doped lead oxide; temperature-programmed reduction; X-ray diffraction 1. Introduction During the last decade of intense research activity there has been much interest in the conversion of natural gas into higher value products such as ethane and ethene (C2+ ), for which a large variety of catalysts has been used. Among the many possible routes, the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) appears to offer short-term promise for converting methane to useful products without extensive energy consumption [ 1 ] . *Corresponding author. 0926-860X/94/$07.00 1994 Elsevier Science B.V.

Mariscal et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General Ill (1994) 79-97 The pioneering work of Keller and Bhasin [ 2] , which has stimulated great interest in the OCM reaction, was pursued by much effort worldwide in developing stable catalytic systems with high selectivities and yields of C2+ hydrocarbons [3-10]. Redox-type oxides constitute a category of catalysts extensively studied for this purpose. Within this category, lead oxide and supported lead oxide have been reported to be suitable for the OCM reaction. The support used plays an important role in controlling the CZ+ selectivity, with basic carriers giving the highest C2+ selectivity. Work by Hinsen et al. [3] demonstrated that alumina-supported lead oxide is very active and its catalytic behaviour depends strongly on the lead oxide loading. However, this system displays limited stability, due to the loss of the active phase. Roos et al. [ 4 ] observed a marked increase in carbon monoxide selectivity after long periods on-stream, and the simultaneous appearance of a lead coating in the colder parts of the reactor, suggesting that PbO is partially lost during the reaction. Chemical analysis of a catalyst revealed 28% PbO after calcination but only a 6% after time-onstream, indicating volatilization of Pb and PbO to be the principal cause of catalyst deactivation. With respect to the mechanism, Bytyn and Baerns [ 6] distinguished two adsorption steps for methane on lead oxide: (i) dissociative adsorption with the subsequent recombination of the adsorbed fragments to yield ethane; and (ii) adsorption as methylcarbonium species on acid sites which then undergo attack by surface O\" - ions, yielding methoxide species which then undergo deep oxidation. For basic surfaces, Carreiro and Baerns [ 11 ] and Carreiro et al. [ 12] proposed an alternative mechanism in which the methylene species can be coupled either with the C-H bond of methane yielding ethane or with other methylene species yielding ethene. However, Sinev et al. [ 13,14] proposed a redox mechanism in terms of an oxidative dehydrogenation of surface hydroxyl groups: 2(OH)5+ Z OZ - 2(O) S + Hz0, this dehydrogenation taking place even in the absence of anionic vacancies. For Mg0- and A1203-supported lead oxide catalysts, Asami et al. [ 15 ] concluded that a redox cycle between Pband Pb2+ species is operative when methane and oxygen are sequentially fed into the reactor, and that the lattice oxygen of PbO is the active species in the OCM reaction over this type of catalysts, whereas the adsorbed oxygen yields carbon oxides. Similarly, ethane and carbon monoxide were found to be primary products which undergo dehydrogenation and oxidation, respectively, to ethene and carbon dioxide [ 16] . They also claimed that the rate-controlling step is the formation of methyl radicals and that both activity and C2+ selectivity depend on the lead loading, the catalyst containing 5% PbO being the most efficient. The relevance of oxygen activation in the OCM mechanism was also emphasized by Bartek et al. [ 17] using a Pb0/MgO catalyst and operating either in cyclic or cofeeding mode. For the same type of catalysts, Agarwal et al. [ 18,19] found a volcano-type pattern for C2+ selectivity with a maximum at 51% being achieved at ca. 5% PbO, and interpreted this behaviour in terms of an \"isolated site\"-type mechanism. In this work, a series of catalysts based on lead oxide supported on a-A1203 were prepared and investigated in the OCM reaction by cofeeding methane and oxygen at 1 bar total pressure. The methodology of the investigation involves incorporation of variable amounts of PbO to the carrier in order to examine the C2+ pattern for both low and high lead oxide loadings. As the C2+ selectivity is enhanced using a MgO carrier, in consistency with many literature reports that the basic property of the catalyst is an important requirement for the OCM reaction [ 6-10,20-23 ] , and to eliminate possible residual acidity of the alumina, R. Mariscal et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 111 (1994) 79-97 81 sodium doping of the raw P60/ a-A1203 catalyst was carried out. The surface and structural changes of PbO are revealed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In particular, this latter technique was shown to be extremely informative with regards to determining the nature of the lead species and changes when used in the OCM reaction. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation A low surface area (4 m2 g-') a-A1203 (Girdler Sudchemie) was used as carrier. The starting alumina cylinders were ground and sieved, and the 0.42-0.58 mm particle size fraction used in all experiments. The catalysts were prepared by adding a-A1203 to an aqueous solution of Pb(N03)2 (Proud) of appropriate concentration to yield PbO loadings of 3, 20 and 30 wt.-%. Excess water was removed in a rotary evaporator. The impregnate was then dried at 383 K in an oven for 10 h and subsequently calcined at 773 K for 4 h. These catalysts are referred to as xPb-A, where x denotes the PbO percentages and A refers to the a-A1203 carrier. The sodium-doped catalysts were prepared by impregnating the 20PbO-A sample with aqueous solutions of Na2C03 (Merck) of appropriate concentration to obtain sodium oxide loadings of 0.5, 2.5 and 5.0 wt.-%. Drying and calcination were the same as above, except that the calcination temperature was 973 K. These Na-promoted catalysts will be labelled yNa-xPbO-A, where y denotes the Na20percentage in the catalysts. The chemical composition of the catalysts is compiled in Table 1. 2.2. Reaction system The coupling reaction was studied using a laboratory scale fixed-bed catalytic reactor with a 9 mm I.D. quartz tube. The catalyst was held in place by a plug of quartz wool. The reactor was placed in a furnace with approximately 20 cm of the tube serving as a preheater.

Mariscal et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 111 (1994) 79-97 A K-type thermocouple encapsulated inside a small quartz tube (4 mm O.D.), whose end was placed in the centre of the catalyst bed, was used to measure the reactor temperature. The CH4 (99% vol. ), OZ (99.995% vol.) and He (99.996% vol.) flow-rates were adjusted to 48, 4 and 68 ml /min, respectively. These flow-rates were measured using electronic mass flow controllers (Argon) before being fed into a preheater situated at the inlet of the quartz reactor. Prior to the reaction the catalysts were pretreated in an oxygen flow at 973 K for 0.5 h. The effluent of the reactor was analyzed using an on-line Hewlett Packard 5890 gas chromatograph with helium as the carrier gas. Two columns connected to a thermal conductivity detector were employed: Porapak Q (3 m X 1 / 8 in.) for the analysis of (CO + OZ) , CH4, CO2, Hz0 and C2+ hydrocarbons and a molecular sieve 13X for the analysis of hydrogen and the separation of carbon monoxide and oxygen. Care was taken to avoid condensation of the products at the outlet of the reactor. The error in methane and oxygen balances were found to be below 2% for methane and 5% for oxygen in all cases. Total conversion (XT), selectivity to product i (S;) and yield of product i (Y;) are defined as: _ moles of CH4 transformed - h -' XT moles of CHQ in the feed - h -' X 100 S - C atoms of i - moles formed of i h -' X 100 ' moles of CH4 transformed - h -' YI - C atoms of i - moles formed of i h X 100 - X - S / 100 moles of CHQ in the feed - h -' T ' 2.3. Experimental techniques The X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded using a Philips PW 1010 vertical diffractometer using nickel-filtered Cu Ka radiation, under constant instrumental parameters. For each sample, Bragg's angles between 5 and 70were scanned at a rate of 2min. TPR experiments were carried out in a Cahn 2000 microbalance working at a sensitivity of 10 l.r.g. The samples were heated in a flow of helium (99.995% vol.) (60 ml/min) up to 923 K in order to remove adsorbed water and other gaseous contaminants. Following cooling to 423 K in the same flow of helium and this was switched to hydrogen (99.994% vol.) (60 ml/ min) and again heated at a rate of 4 K/ min while continuously recording the weight changes. The microbalance was interfaced to a microprocessor which allowed accumulation and processing of weight change-temperature curves. Photoelectron spectra were acquired with a Fisons ESCALAB MkIl 2008 spectrometer equipped with a hemispherical electron analyzer and a Mg Ka 120 W X-ray source. A PDP 11 /04 computer from Digital Equipment Co. was used for collecting and analysing the spectra. The powder samples were pressed into small stainless steel cylinders and then mounted on a sample rod placed in a pretreatment chamber and heated under vacuum at 573 K for 1 h prior to being moved into the analysis chamber. The pressure in the ionpumped analysis chamber was below 3 - 10-9 Torr (1 Torr= 133.3 N m-2) during data acquisition. The spectra were collected for 20 to 90 min, depending on the peak intensities, at a pass energy of 20 eV which is typical of high resolution conditions. The intensities R. Mariscal et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General Ill (1994) 79-97 83 were estimated by calculating the integral of each peak after smoothing and subtraction of the \"S-shaped\" background and fitting the experimental curve to a mixture of lorentzian and gaussian lines of variable proportion. All binding energies (BE) were referenced to the adventitious C is line at 284.9 eV. This reference gave BE values within an accuracy of +0.2 eV. 3. Results 3.1. Catalytic behaviour In order to determine the extent of the homogeneous reaction between methane and oxygen, the reaction was run in the empty reactor. The methane conversion in the gas phase was rather low and increased with temperature as expected, but the maximum conversion did not exceed 0.5%. The steady-state methane conversion and product distributions as a function of the reaction temperature and lead loading for the unpromoted xPb-A catalysts are summarized in Table 2. For comparison the catalytic parameters of the a-A1203 carrier are also compiled in Table 2. The carrier showed some activity but poor C2+ selectivity as confirmed by the presence of only CO, at the lowest temperature (923 K) and only minor amounts Of Cz+ hydrocarbons (C2+ selectivity of 30.7%). Perhaps the most striking result is the unusually high carbon monoxide selectivity observed on the carrier, which can be associated, as already documented in the literature [4,14] to decomposition of the CH20 intermediate on a moderately acid surface.

Moreover, the addition of PbO, even in low proportion (3%), resulted in a sharp increase in the C2+ selectivity. The CZ + selectivity showed a maximum at low loading of Pb0 (3% Pb0). This is almost coincident with the descending branch of a volcano-type behaviour found by Asami et al. [ 15] who reported a maximum C2+ selectivity at 5% Pb0 in Pb/MgO catalysts at a temperature of 1023 K, and by Agarwal et al. [ 18,19] at the same PbO content and reaction temperature. Another major effect observed upon incorporation of PbO to a-A1203 was the dramatic increase in carbon dioxide formation with lead content. For instance, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide were observed in the same proportion on the a-A1203 at 1023 K, however carbon dioxide was in general the only carbon oxide detected on the lead-containing catalysts. The steady-state catalytic properties of the various sodium-doped lead oxide catalysts are summarized in Table 3. A major effect observed upon sodium incorporation is the increase in activity for the same reaction temperature. It was also noted again that carbon dioxide is the only carbon oxide detected in the products. The selectivity trend for these Na-doped catalysts is substantially different from that observed on their unpromoted counterparts. The CZ+ selectivity in Table 3 appears to be constant irrespective of the sodium loading. However, comparison Of C2+ selectivities of the Na-promoted catalysts (Table 3) with that of the unpromoted 20Pb-A homologue (Table 2) indicates a slight decrease in C2+ selectivity from 56.6% for the unpromoted sample to 49.1-52.9% for the Na-promoted counterparts but only at the highest reaction temperature (1023 K). As a result, the net C2+ yield observed at the highest temperature for the Na-promoted catalysts is somewhat higher than for the unpromoted counterpart. This improvement in C2+ yield can intuitively be associated with the sodium promoter because it is known that alkali oxides operate selectively at higher temperatures [ 7,24 ] . R. Mariscal et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 111 (1994) 79-97 85 3.2. Catalyst characterization 3.2.1. Unpromoted Pb0/a-AIZ03 Catalysts X-ray diffraction patterns of the fresh unpromoted xPb-A catalysts are display in Fig. 1. In order to identify the different diffraction peaks, the XRD patterns of the tetragonal PbOte~ (red lead oxide, litharge) and rhombic PbOrom (yellow lead oxide, massicot) were also recorded. For these two reference compounds the intensities of the most prominent peaks were similar to that of the corresponding ASTM files. For the 3Pb-A catalyst all peaks can be indexed to the a-A1203 and the PbO,,, phase, the peaks of the latter being much less intense than that of the former. The XRD patterns of 20Pb-A and 30Pb-A catalysts are more complex. The intensity decrease of the a-A1203 reflections was more pronounced than that expected due to a dilution effect by Pb0 (20 and 30%). Apart from the peaks due to aA1203, two other lead oxides PbO,, , and Pb304 are observed. Notice that ssb304 is obtained from oxidation of PbO at moderately high temperatures [ 25 ] and that this phase is more stable than Pb02 at high temperature [26]. The relative proportion of these two phases (Pb304/PbO,,,), as estimated from the ratio of the most intense diffraction lines of each, reaches a maximum for the 20Pb-A catalyst. Fig. 1 also compiles the XRD patterns of the catalysts used in the OCM reaction. After reaction the blank a-A1203 shows all its characteristic diffraction lines and also a few unidentified peaks of very low intensity whose origin might lie in an aluminium compound resulting from the interaction of reaction products with the a-A1203 surface. The XRD profile for the used 3Pb-A catalyst does not differ from that of the bare a-A1203 with no diffraction pattern of PbO being detected. However, for catalysts 20Pb-A and 30Pb-A (profiles c' and d', respectively) peaks indexed to tetragonal and orthorhombic PbO are clearly discerned but in no case was the Pb304 phase detected. From the comparison of peak intensities in the XRD patterns (Fig. 1) it is evident that lead oxide peaks are more intense in the calcined than in the used catalysts, and also that the alumina peaks decreased substantially in the used catalysts. TPR patterns of the calcined Pb-A catalysts are displayed in Fig. 2A. For the 3Pb-A sample there are two reduction steps placed at ca. 553 and 643 K. These peaks are broad and diffuse probably as a consequence of the high dispersion and interaction of lead oxide with the a-A1203 surface. For the 20Pb-A and 30Pb-A catalysts the TPR profiles are quite different. While the 20Pb-A catalyst displays three peaks at ca. 613, 623 and 633 K, only two peaks at ca. 613 and 643 K are observed for the 30Pb-A catalyst. These TPR peaks are substantially lower than that at ca. 750 K reported by Wendt and Meinecke [27] for an 8 wt.-% Pb0/ a-A'203 catalyst, and much lower than for the bulk PbA1204 at ca. 1030 K. For the 20Pb-A and 30Pb-A catalysts the assignment of these peaks to a given oxide phase was possible by comparing the TPR patterns of reference compounds. Pure PbO and Pb304 compounds showed single TPR peaks at 673 and 693 K, respectively. In the light of these results, and considering the large crystal size of the bulk oxides which can retard the reduction, the high-temperature TPR peak (II and/or III) can be ascribed to reduction of the Pb304 phase while the low-temperature TPR peak (1) can be assigned to the PbO phase. Highly broadened TPR peaks, as in the 30Pb-A catalysts, may be accounted for by a broad distribution of crystal sizes. However, all unpromoted catalysts used in the OCM reaction display a single peak centred at ca. 623 K, due very likely to PbO.

The much lower weight change for the used catalysts as compared to that of the fresh counterparts, which confirms the XRD patterns and the XPS data (see below), may be accounted for by the loss of a fraction of the lead oxide during the severe conditions imposed by the OCM reaction. The chemical state of lead and its abundance at the catalyst surface was revealed by XPS. The Pb4f core level spectra of the fresh, unpromoted catalysts are displayed in Fig. 3 and the binding energies of the most intense peaks of the abundant elements are compiled in Table 5. For comparison, Fig. 3 includes the Pb4f peak of the reference PbO compound. From this series of spectra, it is apparent that all of the fresh catalysts display two peaks at ca. 138.4 and 137.3 eV, the intensity of the latter increasing with increasing lead content. These peaks can be attributed to two different lead oxides species. These results, which agree with that reported by Kim et al. [28] and Thomas and Tricker [29], are attributed to PbO and Pb02, respectively. It is important at this point to focus attention on the anomalous shift of Pb4f core levels with the oxidation state. This anomalous shift observed in the Pb4f peaks having lower binding energies in Pb02 than in PbO show that the chemical shift cannot be understood without considering the final states after photoionization. It can also be observed that the Pb4f peaks for all used catalysts show a single component at ca. 138.3 Table 4 Weigth loss derived from TPR experiments for Pb0/a-A1103 catalysts Catalyst Pb0 Weight loss (%) (%) Fresh Theoretical Used (1023 K) 3Pb-A 3 0.272 0.215 0.042 20Pb-A 20 1.984 1.434 0.502 30Pb-A 30 3.017 2.151 0.863 88 R.

This ratio was calculated using the ratio of peak intensities divided by the sensitivity factor which accounts for the variation of the Pb4f and A12p electron escape depths and detection efficiency with the kinetic energy of the photoelectrons [30]. These values are compiled in the last column of Table 5. It is seen that the Pb/Al ratio increases drastically with increasing lead content in the fresh catalysts, suggesting that tridimensional crystal structures are developed on the carrier surface. Note also that in the used catalysts there is a strong decrease in the MAI ratio, particularly for the catalysts with higher lead loadings. This latter finding, which agrees with the TPR and XRD patterns, can be explained in terms of the loss of a fraction of PbO during the OCM reaction. 3.2.2. Promoted NalPbOla-A1103 catalysts XRD patterns of the Na-promoted 20Pb-A catalysts are displayed in Fig. 4. The most relevant feature of these patterns is the presence of the two crystalline phases of PbO and the absence of Pb304 and Na-containing phases. The TPR profiles of the fresh catalysts display a peak centred at ca. 653 K (Fig. 2B) . Additionally, the 2.5 and 5.ONa-20Pb-A catalysts exhibit a long tail extending towards the high-temperature side. The quantitative data compiled in Table 6 show that the experimental weight loss for the 0.5Na-20Pb-A catalyst is slightly lower than that theoretically expected for the quantitative reduction of PbO to metallic Pb, suggesting partial loss of lead oxide during the second calcination step at 973 K. The higher weight losses for the 2.5 and 5.ONa-20Pb-A catalysts than for the 0.5Na-20Pb-A homologue and the presence of the tail at high temperature in the TPR profiles suggest that thermal decomposition of Na2C03 at the catalyst surface is also Table 6 Weight loss for the Promoted Na=O/Pb0/a-A'203 catalysts calculated from the TPR patterns Catalyst Weigth loss (%) Fresh Theoretical Used 0.5Na-20Pb-A 1.200 1.427 0.535 2.5Na-20P6-A 1.409 1.398 0.934 5.ONa-20Pb-A 1.600 1.362 0.894 90 R.

The TPR profiles for the spent yNa-20Pb-A catalysts are similar to the fresh counterparts although the net weight losses are substantially lower, an almost constant weight change being observed for Na-loadings above 2.5%. Finally, comparison of the TPR data for the used 20Pb-A (Table 4) and yNa-20Pb-A (Table 6) reveals that a larger proportion of lead oxide is retained in the Na-promoted catalysts after time-on-stream. The Pb4f core level spectra of both fresh and used yNa-20Pb-A catalysts are displayed in Fig. 5 with the corresponding binding energies compiled in Table 7. With the exception of the used 0.5Na-20Pb-A catalyst in which a single XP peak due to Pb2+ is observed, two XP components are clearly distinguished for the other two Na-promoted catalysts. It can be noted that the peak of Pb4+ at lower BE is less intense than that of Pb2+. At odds with the presence of only Pbz + species in the used unpromoted catalysts, the Na-promoted counterparts also show a certain proportion of P64+ after the OCM reaction.

Mariscal et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 111 (1994) 79-97 93 xPb-A catalysts, the decrease of Pb/Al ratios in the Na-promoted counterparts is much less pronounced. An opposite trend is observed in the Na/Al ratios which increase markedly after time-on-stream. All these findings clearly indicate that lead evaporation is partially inhibited by adding sodium to the base Pb-A catalysts. 4. Discussion 4.1. Catalytic behaviour and stability of unpromoted catalysts The incorporation of lead into a-A1203 resulted in an increase in both activity and C2+ selectivity of the catalysts for OCM. As the BET area of the catalysts was rather similar to that of the carrier, the specific rate was found to increase with PbO loading. This increase in the rate of methane conversion with lead content and the simultaneous decrease in C2+ selectivity is indicative of the strong oxidizing properties of PbO which is also revealed by the presence of carbon dioxide as the only carbon oxide in the reaction products. Without doubt, the effect of PbO on the C2+ selectivity is interesting. According to the data in Table 2, the catalyst with 3% PbO displays the highest C2+ selectivity while it decreased at high lead loadings. This pattern agrees reasonably with the descending branch of the volcanotype curve observed by Asami et al. [ 15,16] and by Agarwal et al. [ 18,19] on Pb0-Mg0 systems, and indicates the increased oxidizing ability of the catalysts with increasing Pb0 content. To explain the highest C2+ selectivity at low PbO loadings an intuitive \"isolatedsite\" mechanism has been proposed. In this mechanism the rate of methyl radical generation is high and the total methane conversion is also high, and simultaneously these radicals have little possibility of being deeply oxidized by a neighbouring strong oxidizing site thus desorbing to the gas phase where they can be coupled to form ethane. On examining the photoelectron spectra of fresh catalysts in Fig. 3 it is clear that the proportion of Pb4+ in lead oxide increases with increasing PbO content. As the lattice oxygen mobility is expected to be higher in the lead(IV) oxide (or P6304), the increased carbon dioxide selectivity observed with increasing lead contents and the concomitant decrease in C2+ selectivity can be associated with the presence of Pb4+ ions in the catalysts. The stability of the Pb-A catalysts under the severe experimental conditions imposed by the OCM reaction is poor. As shown in Fig. 1, the intensity of the diffraction lines of lead oxide phases is strongly depleted, or even absent for the 3Pb-A, in the spent catalysts. Qualitatively, this finding indicates a loss of crystallinity during the OCM reaction, but if one turns to the weight losses measured in TPR experiments and to the comparison of XPS Pb/Al atomic ratios (Fig. 6), it is evident that important lead oxide losses occur during time-on-stream. Thus, the TPR results in Table 4 indicate unequivocally that the PbO content of the used catalysts is 4-6 times lower than in the fresh counterparts. In a similar manner, the plot of the XPS Pb/Al ratios for the used catalysts against that for the fresh ones indicates that the Pb/Al ratios decreased at least three times for the catalysts with the highest PbO contents. This conclusion could be expected from the moderate vapour pressure of lead oxide at the temperatures of the OCM reaction. For instance, from thermodynamic data [ 31 ] the vapour pressure of PbO at 1023 K is 0.0163 Torr. From this calculation, it is clear that important 94 R. Mariscal et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 111(1994) 79-97 losses of the active ingredient take place during the reaction, even for the rather short period of a few hours on-stream. 4.2. Active phases and mechanistic features The joint use of XRD, TPR and XPS (Figs. 1 to 3) demonstrates that PbO is accompanied by the Pb,04 phase even in the catalyst with the lowest lead oxide content (3% Pb0). The proportion of the two PbO and Pb;04 phases measured in the catalysts is not exactly the same for all these techniques. Thus, while both TPR and XPS techniques reveal a larger proportion of the Pb304 phase in the 30% PbO catalyst, the XRD patterns display the maximum of this species for the 20% PbO catalyst. The explanation of this discrepancy may lie in the limited sensitivity of the XRD technique to detect particles of sizes below 5 nm. The presence of a certain proportion of the Pb304 phase, as revealed by the Pb4f spectra of the calcined catalysts, whose proportion increased with increasing lead content, would not be considered responsible for the strong oxidizing capacity of these catalysts. It is emphasized at this point that the Pb304 phase becomes unstable above 820 K, which decomposes according to the equation: Pb304 - 3Pb0+'-z02. In other words, the coverage of adsorbed oxygen over the PbO surface must be negligibly small at higher temperatures, because the oxygen dissociation pressure of Pb304 at 1023 K is about 9.9 bar [32]. Accordingly, lattice oxygen released from the PbO phase seems to be the principal source of oxygen for the activation of methane. It can also be added that the orthorhombic Pb0 phase is dominant during the reaction because this is the most stable lead oxide at the typical reaction temperatures; the observation of a minor proportion of the tetragonal PbO phase in the used catalysts would suggest that this transformation is kinetically controlled, its complete disappearance would require very long reaction periods at high temperatures. The above findings provide some clues relevant to the mechanism of the OCM reaction on lead oxide. In the light of characterization data of the used catalysts in the cofed mode, a redox mechanism as proposed by Asami et al. [ 15] for Pb0/MgO catalysts operating in a cyclic mode seems to be operative. As pointed out by Keller and Bhasin [ 2 ] , the adsorption of methane on redox metal oxides under the conditions of oxidative coupling may result in dissociation of methyl and hydroxyl radicals: CH, + Pb0 -- PbCH3 ' + OH - , and simultaneously oxygen is dissociatively adsorbed for reoxidation of the catalyst according to the reaction: Pb zOZ-j PbO. From the analysis of kinetic data, Asami et al. [ 15] suggested that the reoxidation rate is at least 90 times larger than that of methyl radical formation, and that the rate-determining step of the OCM reaction should be the formation of methyl radicals via the reaction of methane and lattice oxygen. This may explain why in our case no Pbis detected in the used catalysts. Moreover, activity measurements in the same temperature window with the 20Pb-A catalyst, in the absence of oxygen in the feed, resulted in a measurable methane conversion, but extended only to a few minutes on stream, the time required for the consumption of lattice oxygen of PbO. 4.3. Promoter effect of sodium 4.3.1. Catalytic behaviour and stability Comparison of the catalytic behaviour of the Na-promoted catalysts and its unpromoted 20Pb-A homologue (Table 2 and 3) clearly indicate that sodium incorporation yields higher methane conversions, in good agreement with the general tendency observed in the literature R. Mariscal et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 111 (1994) 79-97 95 [ 10,20,33-36]. Also evident from Tables 2 and 3 is that C2+ selectivities for the Napromoted catalysts are somewhat lower than for the unpromoted 20Pb-A homologue, but the net Cz+ yield higher in the former case, in particular for higher promoter loadings. Apart from the beneficial effect of sodium in the overall C2+ yield, catalyst stability also seems to be improved by the action of the promoter. The comparison of TPR profiles of the Napromoted catalysts (Fig. 2B) with that of the Na-free 20Pb-A homologue (Fig. 2A, profile c) shows clearly that catalyst reduction for the Na-doped catalysts ends at ca. 780 K, more than 120 K than for its Na-free counterpart. Consequently, the primary effect of promoter on the inhibition of the reduction of lead oxide appears beneficial for catalyst stability because lead vaporization is depleted. Further support for this is provided by the results in Table 6 which confirm that the remaining lead oxide in the used Na-promoted catalysts is higher than in the Na-free 20Pb-A homologue. 4.3.2. Sodium-lead oxide interaction The above discussion emphasized the enhancement of the stability of lead oxide upon adding sodium to the base Pb-A catalyst, but it is not clear if its origin is physical or chemical in nature. As revealed by the XRD patterns in Fig. 4, the presence of sodium in both fresh and used promoted Pb-A catalysts modifies the equilibrium of the two crystalline phases of PbO, with a shift towards the rhombohedral PbO, more pronounced in the used catalysts. As the crystallinity is a tridimensional property it can be argued that the effect of sodium is confined to depths of many subsurface atomic layers of lead oxide, which are large enough to explain these changes by a mere surface process. Indirect evidence on the sodium-lead oxide interaction also comes from the quantitative TPR data, which indicated larger amounts of lead oxide retained by the used catalysts. The simplest interpretation of this effect would be the physical deposition of sodium oxide on the surface of lead oxide crystals, decreasing the exposed area and therefore the evaporation rate. A clearer picture on this interaction is revealed by XPS. The Pb4f spectra of the yNa-20Pb-A catalysts used in the OCM reaction (Fig. 5) revealed that a certain proportion of Pb4+, which increased with increasing sodium content, was always present at the catalyst surface. As the Ph\" was the only species detected in the unpromoted Pb-A catalysts after the OCM reaction, it appears that sodium is responsible for the chemical stabilization of Ph\" species. Further support for this interpretation comes from the dependence of Pb/Al and Na/AI atomic ratios in both fresh and used catalysts (Fig. 6). The higher Pb/Al ratios in the used yNa-20Pb-A catalysts with respect to the unpromoted Pb-A counterparts and the concomitant increase in the Na/Al ratios for used catalysts can be understood assuming the formation of an interacting phase between sodium and lead oxide. Because lead oxide is expected to be evaporated more slowly from this interacting phase during the OCM reaction, the Pb/Al ratio would be maintained moderately high, but simultaneously as the evaporation of lead oxide progresses, more exposed sodium is available at the catalyst surface. In short, the combined use of XRD, TPR and XPS techniques provides evidence for the formation of a sodium-lead oxide interacting phase. 5. Conclusions Undoped and Na-doped lead oxides supported on a-A1203 were found to be active and selective in the oxidative coupling of methane. In general, the methane conversion increased 96 R. Mariscal et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 111 (1994) 79-97 with increasing Pb-loading but the C2+ selectivity decreased slightly. An additional other major effect observed upon the incorporation of PbO to a-A1203 was the dramatic increase in carbon dioxide with lead content. The combined use of XRD, TPR and XPS revealed that a certain proportion of Pb'+ species, larger for the catalysts with higher lead oxide content, is present in the undoped catalysts. As this species is not stable under the reaction conditions, the strong oxidising capacity of the catalysts can be associated with the lattice oxygen of PbO. The same techniques also revealed that lead oxide is partially evaporated under the severe conditions imposed by the OCM, although the evaporation can be diminished by doping with sodium. The beneficial effect of sodium on the catalyst stability is also accompanied by a better catalyst performance due to the ability of sodium oxide to activate methane. 6.

Soria M.A. Peña J.L.G. Fierro 1 Institute de Catálisis y Petroleoquimica, CSIC, Campus UAM, Cantoblanco, 28049 Madrid, Spain 1 Corresponding author. Undoped and Na-doped lead oxides supported on α-Al2O3 were used in the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) by cofeeding methane and oxygen at atmospheric pressure. In general, the methane conversion increased with increasing Pb-loading but the C2+ selectivity decreased slightly. Another major effect observed on incorporation of PbO into α-Al2O3 was the dramatic increase of carbon dioxide with lead content. The combined use of X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed reduction and photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that a certain proportion of Pb4+ species is present in the undoped catalysts, and this is greater for the catalysts with higher lead oxide content. These techniques also revealed that lead oxide is partially evaporated under severe conditions imposed by the OCM, although the evaporation can be diminished by doping with sodium. The beneficial effect of sodium on the catalyst stability is also accompanied by a better catalyst performance due to the ability of sodium oxide to activate methane.

        "dc:description": "Undoped and Na-doped lead oxides supported on α-Al2O3 were used in the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) by cofeeding methane and oxygen at atmospheric pressure. In general, the methane conversion increased with increasing Pb-loading but the C2+ selectivity decreased slightly. Another major effect observed on incorporation of PbO into α-Al2O3 was the dramatic increase of carbon dioxide with lead content. The combined use of X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed reduction and photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that a certain proportion of Pb4+ species is present in the undoped catalysts, and this is greater for the catalysts with higher lead oxide content. These techniques also revealed that lead oxide is partially evaporated under severe conditions imposed by the OCM, although the evaporation can be diminished by doping with sodium. The beneficial effect of sodium on the catalyst stability is also accompanied by a better catalyst performance due to the ability of sodium oxide to activate methane.",
