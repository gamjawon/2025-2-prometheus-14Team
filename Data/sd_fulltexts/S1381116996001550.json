Box 1759, Al-Hofuf 31982 Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia Received 5 January 1996; accepted 5 April 1996 Abstract The catalytic decomposition of 2-propanol (2-PrOH) was studied as probe reaction, in the gas phase, over unsupported Mo03-Fe203 mixed catalysts. The samples were prepared by mixing M003 (as ammonium heptamolybdate) with different x mol% Fe203 (as ferric nitrate) and calcined at 500 in air for 5 h. All catalysts were characterized by TPR, IR, XRD and XPS analyses. The surface area of these samples were determined using the BET method. Also, the acidity and the basicity of all catalysts were estimated thermogravimetrically using the adsorption of pyridine and fornllc acid as probe molecules. The catalytic decomposition of 2-PrOH was studied over the catalysts in the temperature range of 150-260. A correlation between the catalytic activity and the acidity or the basicity of these catalysts has been made. The activation energies for both propene and acetone formation, over M003-Fe203 catalysts, were calculated.

Introduction M003, Fe203 and Mo-Fe-O mixed oxides, as pure or supported materials, have emerged as a very important class of catalysts with many areas of industrial applications, such as the oxidation of propene [ 1 ], ammonia [2] and butene [3] and thiophene hydrodesulphurization (HDS) [4]. Mixtures of ferrimolybdate and M003 have been widely used in the selective oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde [5,6]. Several techniques have been used to characterize M003 Corresponding author.

PIIS1381-1169(96)00155-0 [7,8], Fe203 [9,10], Fe2Mo04 and Fe2(M004)3 [11-14]. Decomposition of 2-propanol to propene and/or acetone is extensively used to characterize acid-base or redox properties of catalysts [15-18]. The dehydrogenation product (acetone) is preferentially formed on basic catalysts, e.g. Fe203, while the dehydration product (propene) is essentially formed when acid sites are available [ 15] as in case of M003 [ 19]. Recently Ouqour et al. [20] have studied the conversion of 2-propanol, over CoMo04 and N'M004, to investigate the redox and acid-base properties of such catalysts (in presence and absence of air respectively). The purpose of this work was to characterize the unsupported M003-Fe203 mixed catalysts, 480 S.S. Al-Shihry, S.A. Halawy/Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 113 (1996) 479-487 using different techniques, and an attempt has been made to correlate the catalytic activity of these catalysts, during the decomposition of 2PrOH, with their structure and the acid-base properties. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials and techniques Pure M003 and Fe203 were prepared by calcination of analytical grade ammonium heptamolybdate (AHM) (NH4)6Mo7OZ4 4H20 (Fisons) and ferric nitrate Fe(N03)3 9H20 (Hopkin and Williams) at 500 for 5 h in air. Samples of M003 containing x mol% Fe203, after calcination at 500 (where x = 0.5, 5, 10, 30, 50, 70 and 90) were prepared. Calculated amounts of (AHM) and Fe(N03)3 - 9H20 were used to prepare sufficient amounts of the catalysts as explained previously [19], then the catalyst samples were calcined in air for 5 h at 500. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) of the catalysts, calcined at 500, was done in apparatus described elsewhere [21]. TPR profiles were recorded at the same experimental conditions as indicated previously [22]. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed using a Philips diffractometer (P.W. 2103/00) with Ni-filtered CuKa radiation (.t = 1.542 . IR absorption spectra were recorded by means of a Perkin-Elmer 599B IR spectrophotometer, adopting the KBr disc technique, in the region 1600-200 cm-1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using a Kratos ES300 spectrometer. The aluminum Kq line (1486.4 eV) was used for excitation. The X-ray power supply was run at 14 kV and 15 mA with a response time of 1 s and a range of 1014 CPS. Surface area measurements were performed using the BET method, using liquid NZ at -196 as adsorbate on a Carlo-Erba, single point, SORPTY 1750 unit. The acidity (IF) and the basicity ( of catalyst samples were determined thermogravimetrically, as described previously [23], using the adsorption of pyridine and formic acid as probe molecules. The weight loss was estimated as the acidity or basicity of the catalyst. The values of ('F) and ( were calculated [24] as [H+] or [OH-] X 1018 ions/m2 catalyst, respectively. Measurements of activity and selectivity of all catalysts, during the decomposition course of 2-PrOH, were conducted in a continuous flow system under atmospheric pressure. The detailed experimental procedure is described elsewhere [19]. Also, the reaction rates, catalytic activity, selectivity and the kinetic parameters of the decomposition of 2-PrOH were calculated as explained earlier [19]. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) The TPR profiles of M003-Fez03 catalysts calcined, in air, for 5 h at 500 are shown in Fig. 1. The TPR pattern of M003 (Fig. la) displayed two reduction peaks with Tma,, at 683 and 818, corresponding to the reduction steps, M003 -4 M002 -4 Mo [25,26], which is confirmed by a ratio of areas under the peaks of approximately (1:2). The experimental H 2 uptake was calculated as 2.14 X 10-z mol/g (which is in agreement with the theoretical value i.e. 2.08 X 10-2 mol/g). The TPR profile of Fe203 (Fig. li) showed a small peak at 353 and another big peak at 537 which might be attributed to stepwise reduction of Fe203 to metallic Fe [27] as follows: Fe203 (hematite) -4 Fe304 (magnetite) - Fe (metal) This is in agreement with the reduction mechanism, reported previously [28-30], where S.S.

TPR profiles of Mo03 (a), Mo03 mixed with x mol% Fe203 (b-h) and Fe203 (i), calcined in air at 500 for 5 h, carried out at 5/min in 6% H, /N2 (40 cm 3 /min). no Fe0 (Wtite) is encountered below 575. Also, this is consistent with the calculated area of the TPR peaks of Fe203 (Fig. li). The hydrogen amount required for the complete reduction of Fe203 is calculated theoretically [31] as 1.87 X 10-Z mol/g which is in close agreement with the HZ uptake found (ca. 1.95 X 10-2 mol/g). Evidence for Fe304 intermediate in reduction of a-Fe203 has been given, previously, by Gazzarini and Lanzavecchia [32] and Colombo et al. [33]. The addition of 0.5, 5 and 10 mol% Fe203 to Mo03 had little effect on the reduction of Mo03, as the TPR profiles (Fig. lb-d) have the same reduction peaks as those of Mo03 with TmaX shifted to lower values and, in addition, a shoulder at 567-590 which may be attributed to 481 the reduction of Fe203. Increasing the mol% Fe203 added (i.e. 30, 50 and 70 mol% Fe203) gave different shapes of TPR patterns, (Fig. le-g). It is assumed that Fe2(Mo04)3 is formed in these samples, containing 30-70 mol% Fe203, then undergoes a complete reduction to the corresponding Fe and Mo metals in the final stage. These patterns (Fig. le-g) are characterized by a shoulder in the range 416-538, and a peak at 524-615. The shoulder can be due to the reduction of Fe203 to Fe metal, while the peak located between 524 and 615 can be related to the reduction of the residual Fez03, in Fe.'(Mo04)3, to metallic Fe as well as the reduction of Mo03 to Mo02. There is another peak in the temperature range 743-811 (patterns e-g), which is attributed to the reduction of Mo02 to Mo metal. It is worth noting here, that significant additions of Fe203 to Mo03 ( x = 30-70 mol%) have resulted in a catalyzed reduction of Mo03, to Mo metal, at lower temperatures as reported previously in case of Mo03Co304 system [22,34]. Finally, the TPR profile of Mo03-90 mol% Fe.,03 (Fig. lh) shows a strong peak at TI = 552, with a shoulder at 440, corresponds to the reduction of Fe203 to Fe metal, while the second small one is related to the reduction of Mo03 to Mo metal at Tm. _ 697. The addition of Mo03 to Fe203 inhibits the reduction of Fe203 to Fe metal, because Mo6+ ions polarize Fe-O bonds in the same way as A13+ ions do, making them more ionic, and consequently stronger and less reducible [35]. The values of HZ uptake of M003-Fe203 catalysts are cited in Table 1. These values increased gradually with the addition of Fe203 to Mo03 and attained a maximum (i.e., 2.48 X 10-2 mol/g), at Mo-Fe-V then decreased with increasing Fe203 content. 3.2.

The XRD pattern of Mo-Fe-I (Fig. 2b) had the same characteristic lines of pure Mo03 (Fig. 2a), especially the main intense lines at d = 3.818, 3.466, 3.267, 2.652, 2.309 and 1.852 (ASTM card No. 5-0508). The XRD patterns of Mo-Fe-II and Mo-Fe-III (Fig. 2c and d) were characterized by the appearance of a new diffraction line at d = 3.986 A besides the same lines of Mo03. The intensity of that line increased with increasing Fe203 content, .C 3 ro a . C ro and became the most intense line in patterns of Mo-Fe-IV and Mo-Fe-V (where x = 30 and 50 mol% Fe203), see Table 1 and Fig. 2 (patterns e and f). This can be due to the formation of the orthorhombic phase of Fez(Mo04)3 [36,37], as it matches well the fernmolybdate pattern (ASTM card No. 20-526). Our results are in good agreement with previously published work by Chen [38] on iron(III)molybdate, especially those lines at d = 4.439, 4.171, 3.969, 3.520, (e) Mo-Fe-IV (i) Fe203 x=30 (d) Mo -Fe-111 (h) Mo -Fe 411 x=10 x=90 (c) Mo-Fe-II (g) Mo-Fe YI x=5 x=70 (b) Mo-Fe-I (f) Mo-Fe-Y x=0 x= 50 (a) Mo03 ASTM= Fe2(Mo04)3 t nn i i ii i i i 20-526 iii i i mmmnun 0 1 3 5 7 d-spacing ( 3 5 d -spacing ( Fig. 2.

The XRD diffractogram of Mo-Fe-VI showed an observed decrease in the intensity of the diffraction line assigned to Fe2(Mo04)3 at d = 3.986 which has completely vanished from pattern (h) of Mo-Fe-VII (containing 90 mol% Fe203). There is a new diffraction line appearing in patterns (Fig. 2g and h) of Mo-Fe-VI and Mo-Fe-VII at d = 2.730 A with I/1 = 100, which is ascribed to the separation of Fez03 in these mixtures. The XRD pattern of Mo-Fe-VII is almost identical with the pattern of pure Fe203 (ASTM card No. 24-27A, see also (Fig. 2i), where the diffraction lines are at d = 3.728, 2.704, 2.515, 2.206 and 1.692 From the XRD analysis, one can notice that the formation of Fe2(Mo04)3 has started in sample (Mo-Fe-II) containing 5 mol% Fez03, while samples Mo-Fe-IV and Mo-Fe-V (containing 30 and 50 mol% Fe203) showed the maximum concentration of ferrimolybdate formed among these mixtures, as suggested from TPR analysis. Increasing the Fe203 content up to 90 mol% in these mixtures gave identical XRD pattern of Fe203. 3.3. IR analysis From the recorded spectra of M003-Fe203 catalysts calcined at 500 the spectra of M003, Mo-Fe-I, Mo-Fe-II and Mo-Fe-III (Fig. 3a-d) have the same absorption band at 990 cm-', which can be due to Mo = O stretching mode [38], followed by a group of bands in the range 850-555 cm-' which are attributed to the stretching mode of the bridge oxygen Mo-OMo [39]. Also, the bands of the deformation mode of O-Mo-O in the region 420-230 cm-' appear in these spectra (Fig. 3a-d). The IR spectra of samples Mo-Fe-IV, Mo-Fe-V and Mo-Fe-VI (containing 30, 50 and 70 mol% Fez03) showed new bands at 855-840 cm-' and 550-535 cm-', which are related to the formation of Fe2(Mo04)3 in these mixtures and assigned to P(Fe-Mo-O) [40-42] as well as the frequencies assigned to O-Mo-O.

IR spectra of M003 (a), M003 mixed with (b-h) and Fe203 (i), calcined in air at 5000C for 5 h. served frequencies of IR spectra of such samples (Fig. 3e-g) are consistent with those reported by Cord et al. [43]. The IR spectrum of Fe203 (Fig. 30 showed the characteristic frequencies of a-Fe203 (hematite) [44] at 560, 470, 380 and 395 cm-'. Finally, the spectrum of Mo-Fe-VII (see Table 1) showed the similar bands of a-Fe203 besides a group of absorption bands at 665 and 445-225 cm-' due to OMo-O deformation mode. The IR results support the XRD results, where Fe2(Mo04)3 is clearly shown to be formed by the IR spectrum and XRD pattern of Mo-Fe-V (containing 50 mol% Fe203) and Mob+ ions are characterized in all spectra (Fig. 3), except for spectra (h) and (i), by two absorption bands at 960 and 840 cm-' [451. x mol% FeZ03 3.4.

All binding energies were referenced to the contaminated carbon (C is = 284.6 eV). The binding energy of the Mo 3d5/2 level was 233.4 eV, in case of M003 and Mo-Fe-1, indicating the presence of higher Mo-O oxidation states which are characteristic of M06+ [12,46]. The addition of x mol% Fe203 (i.e. x = 5, 10, 30, 50, 70, and 90) has lowered the binding energy of Mo 3d level from 233.4 to about 230.0 eV. This new value indicated the presence of Mos+ and Mob+ in these mixtures, as reported by Patterson et al. [47] in M003/A'Z03 reduced catalysts. In case of FeZ03, the binding energies of Fe 2P3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 levels were calculated as 713.6 and 727.2 eV respectively. These values match those published by Armour et al. [48]. The binding energy of Fe 2P3 2 level (ca. 713.6 eV) corresponds to Fe 3+ [49]x. The addition of M003 to Fe203 has slightly changed the binding energy of Fe 2P3/2 and Fe 2pt/2 to lower values, see Table 2. Our results are consistent with those obtained by other workers [50,51] for Fe203_MoO3 catalysts. 3.5.

Effect of catalyst composition on its acidic-basic properties and activity, during the decomposition of 2-ptopanol, of M003-Fe203 catalysts calcined in air at 500 for 5 h. S.S. Al-Shihry, S.A. Halawy/Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 113 (1996) 479-487 where Rp (the rate of propene formation) decreased to about one quarter of its original value for M003. Increasing Fe203 content to 5 mol% Fe203 improved the value of RP to 57.8 mmol/h - m2at, then it decreased gradually with increasing the mol% Fe203. M003 is mainly selective towards propene formation but a continuous increase in mol% Fe203 added to M003 results in a notable decrease in % Sp (% propene selectivity), see Fig. 4. The lessening of % Sp goes parallel with the decrease in the measured values of the acidity (lY) of these catalysts, see Table 1. Fe203 is highly selective towards acetone formation (i.e. % Sa = 72.3), with a relatively lower value of propene selectivity (i.e. % Sp = 27.7). The calculated values of Ra (the rate of acetone formation) of M003-Fe203 system, Fig. 4 and Table 3, were very small related to the values of Rp of these catalysts. This is because the basic sites on Fe203, that are responsible for the formation of acetone [15], were still inactive at 200 where the dehydrogenation of 2-PrOH was carried out, as in case of the selective oxidation of butene [3]. The gradual increase of % Sa with increasing the amount of Fe203 in the catalysts, also, goes parallel with the measured values of the basicity ( of such samples, see Fig. 4 and Table 1. The % conversion over Mo-Fe-I is nearly one fifth of its value over Mo03. Also, conversion increased gradually with increasing 485 mol% Fe203 added to M003. The maximum value of % conversion (ca. 38.3%) is located at sample Mo-Fe-V, containing 50 mol% Fe203. The addition of 70 and 90 mol% Fe203 to M003 decreased gradually % conversion of 2PrOH over such samples. Fe203, on the other hand, has a very low activity towards 2-PrOH decomposition at the same experimental conditions (% conversion = 2.4%). The dehydration reaction of 2-PrOH is catalyzed at acidic sites and the dehydrogenation reaction is catalyzed at both acidic and basic sites [52]. M003 has Br6nsted acidity [53] and its measured acidity (~V) = 4.8 X 1018 ions/mat, therefore it is mainly selective towards propene formation. Fe203, on the other hand, has Brdnsted basicity (= 9.5 X 1018 ions/mat) with the presence of some acid sites [54] (W= 1.2 X 1018 ions/meat), and consequently Fe203 is selective towards both acetone and propene formation (see Table 3). The addition of Fe203 to M003 has resulted in a gradual increase in its activity, due to the generation of new sites VMob+ (molybdenum vacancies) and VOz- (oxygen vacancies) during the formation of Fe2(MO04)3 according to the equation [36]: 3MO03 + Fe203 -> Fe2(Mo04)3 + VMo6+ + 3VO2- Increasing the concentration of Fe2(Mo04)3, in these mixtures, leads to the generation of Table 3 Kinetic parameters for the decomposition of 2-PrOH over M003-FeZ03 catalysts, calcined at 500 for 5 h in air as well as the activation energies for propene and acetone formation at the corresponding temperature ranges Catalyst description % conversion RZ_PrdH RP Ra Temperature range EP Ea (mmol/h m2g,) (mmol/h meat) (mmol/h ~ m2 cat ) () (kJ/mol) (kJ/mol) M003 17.7 118.2 113.8 4.4 180-210 75 5 46 f 8 Mo-Fe-1 3.7 33.0 31.2 1.8 200-250 67 6 53 t 10 Mo-Fe-11 20.4 60.8 57.8 3.0 160-200 102 +_ 5 71 +_ 3 Mo-Fe-111 27.5 56.7 52.0 4.7 150-200 109 + 7 59 +_ 6 Mo-Fe-IV 32.8 41.8 37.8 4.0 150-200 106 8 58 t 3 Mo-Fe-V 38.3 19.3 16.8 2.5 150-185 103 _+ 4 65 +_ 2 Mo-Fe-VI 36.2 10.6 8.2 2.4 150-200 101 +_ 6 63 +_ 9 Mo-Fe-VII 35.1 6.5 4.3 2.2 150-200 99 f 2 75 t 7 Fe203 2.4 0.6 0.2 0.4 220-260 110 3 130 t 8 R1_p,oH = total rate of removal of 2-PrOH; % reactant = 1.2%; W/F = 1.87 g cat mol/L temperature = 200. h; total flow rate = 100 mL/min; reaction 486 S.S.

Sample Mo-Fe-V, containing 50 mol% Fe203, showed the maximum concentration of Fe2(Mo04)3, as confirmed by XRD and IR analyses (see Figs. 2 and 3); then Fe2(Mo04)3 diminished gradually in samples containing > 50 mol% Fe203. This is consistent with the above equation and the experimental data (Ta ble 3 and Fig. 4). Also, % Sp decreased gradu ally due to the replacement of Mo6+ by Fe 3+ in these mixtures and consequently the expected yield of the dehydration reaction of 2-PrOH will decrease [36]: C3H7OH + Mob++ 02 _), Mo5++ CH3-CH=CH2 + H20 The activation energy for propene and ace tone formation (EP and Ea) was calculated from the Arrhenius plots of log RP (rate of propene formation) or log Ra (rate of acetone formation) against 1/T as explained previously [19]. The values of EP increased gradually from 67 t 6 to 99 2 kJ/mol with increasing mol% Fe203 in these mixtures and, also, with decreasing the acidity of the catalysts, see Tables 1 and 3. The values of Ea is ranging between 53 10 and 75 7 kJ/mol for the mixed catalysts. The calculated values of EP and Ea in this work, are in great agreement with those published re- cently, on CoMo04 and NiMo04, by Ouqour et References al. [20]. From the values of EP and Ea of pure Fe203 (Table 3) one can notice that the higher values of the activation energy (and low % conversion) suggests that Fe203 is still an inac tive catalyst at the applied range of temperature (220-260) compared with other catalysts in this series. Fe203 is known to be a very active catalyst at higher temperatures (> 350) as in case of the selective oxidation of butene to butadiene [3]. 4. Conclusions Finally, it is concluded that the decomposi- tion of 2-PrOH over M003-Fe203 catalysts, calcined at 500 for 5 h in air, depends mainly on two factors: (i) the composition of the catalysts, where the sample with the composition of Mo03-50 mol% Fe203) in this series was shown to be the most active one. It contains the highest concentration of Fe2(Mo04)3, accompanied by the generation of more canon-anion pair sites, as confirmed by XRD and IR analyses; and (ii) the surface acidic-basic characters of these catalysts. The addition of increased amounts of Fe203 (as mol%) to Mo03 have resulted in a continuous decrease of the concentration of Brsted acidic sites and, consequently, an increase in the concentration of the basic Brsted sites on their surfaces. This is parallel with the increments of (% Sa) selectivities of the catalysts towards acetone production. Acknowledgements We gratefully acknowledge Professor G.C.

The catalytic decomposition of 2-propanol (2-PrOH) was studied as probe reaction, in the gas phase, over unsupported MoO3Fe2O3 mixed catalysts. The samples were prepared by mixing MoO3 (as ammonium heptamolybdate) with different x mol% Fe2O3 (as ferric nitrate) and calcined at 500°C in air for 5 h. All catalysts were characterized by TPR, IR, XRD and XPS analyses. The surface area of these samples were determined using the BET method. Also, the acidity and the basicity of all catalysts were estimated thermogravimetrically using the adsorption of pyridine and formic acid as probe molecules. The catalytic decomposition of 2-PrOH was studied over the catalysts in the temperature range of 150–260°C. A correlation between the catalytic activity and the acidity or the basicity of these catalysts has been made. The activation energies for both propene and acetone formation, over MoO3Fe2O3 catalysts, were calculated.
