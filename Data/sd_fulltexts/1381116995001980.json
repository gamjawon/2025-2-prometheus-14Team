Introduction There are numerous catalytic methods for the selective hydrogenation of the carbon-carbon double bond in a,unsaturated carbonyl compounds [ 1 ]. The most important factors affecting this catalytic hydrogenation are the choice of metal, ligand and reaction conditions. Under mild conditions, selective hydrogenation of the carbon-carbon double bond of a, /3-unsaturated ketones and aldehydes was achieved by the use of a catalyst generated from the reaction of the bulky binuclear palladium complex Corresponding author. 1381-1169/96/$15.00 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

This catalytic system was also very useful for the hydrogenation of a,/3-unsaturated sulfones and phosphonates [5]. The binuclear palladium complex 1 was not active itself for the hydrogenation of a, (3-unsaturated carbonyls, sulfones or phosphonates. I The authors of ref. [41 isolated a complex on treatment of 1 and oxygen. They claimed that the complex was responsible for the catalytic hydrogenation of a,/3-unsaturated carbonyls. Observations in our laboratory (R. Aldea, unpublished results) show that the catalytic activity of the complex is significantly less than that of a mixture of 1 and 02. Clearly another, as yet unidentified, compound may be responsible for the catalysis reported herein and in refs. [31 and [5]. 8 1.S. Cho, H. Alper /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 106 (1996) 7-10 Alternatives to employing molecular oxygen in these reactions were considered in order to avoid sequential use of two gases, and to compare the selectivity in reduction reactions. Previous studies have shown that di-tert-butyl perox- ide is an effective substitute for oxygen in oxidative carbonylation reactions [6]. We now wish to report that the combination of 1 and di-tertbutyl peroxide results in the generation of an effective catalytic system for the selective re- Table 1 Hydrogenation of a,/3-unsaturated carbonyls, phosphonates and sulfones catalyzed by [(BuZPH)PdPBu212 pretreated with oxygen (method A) or di-tert-butyl peroxide (method B) a Mol % of Reaction Entry Substrate Method catalyst Tmeft) O C5H11 Isolated Yield(%) A 2 10 97 b O CsH1l' V H 2 1 95 A 1 14 ph.,o~CHO 80:56)e 2 pb~CHO B 1 6 Ph OH 79(73:27) Ph A 2 0.5 Ph 88a H3C-~ 3 ~OEt)2 B 2 2 OEt)2 84 A 2 24 75 a 4 ~ ~P-(OEt~ __\\ ~P-(OEt O B 2 18 O 72 SOZPh 6 ~S41CH3 A 2 5 83d B 2 t5 \"O\"~\"SOyPh _25 A 2 1 83 a '-'~SOzCH3 B 2 2 79 A 4 4 93 a 7 Ph,,^ SOZPh(p-CHg) Ph \"Y~SOZPh(p-CHg) H3C H3C B 4 30 ' The unsaturated phosphonates and sulfones were prepared as described in refs.

Results and discussion The catalytically active system was generated by treatment of the binuclear palladium complex, 1, with di-tert-butyl peroxide in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at 60 for 30 min. Addition of the substrate and hydrogen, at room temperature and one atmosphere, afforded the product. These reactions were affected using a 25-100/1 ratio of substrate to 1, with reaction times of 1-30 h, and the results are presented in Table 1. The a,(3-unsaturated ketone, 3-nonen-2-one (Table 1, entry 1), underwent facile hydrogenation using a 50/1 ratio of substrate/1, affording 2-nonanone in 95% isolated yield. The yield of product was comparable to that using 1/O2, but the time required for completion of the reaction was appreciably less in the case of di-tert-butyl peroxide (1 h vs. 10 h using OZ). The reduction of cinnamaldehyde (entry 2) was also faster using di-tert-butyl peroxide than oxygen and the selectivity for 3-phenylpropanal was higher in the case of the peroxide. Although saturated phosphonates were isolated in similar yields from their a,/3-unsaturated precursors (entries 3, 4), the reactions were more rapid using oxygen. While 1/((CH3)3CO)2 is active for the hydrogenation of vinyl sulfones (entries 5-7), the reactions are less facile than those using 1/OZ, and the product yields are lower as well. Note that the ratio of di-tert-butyl peroxide to 1 in these reactions was 10/ 1. This ratio was used simply for the convenience of handling. For example, use of only a 2:1 ratio of [(CH 3)3CO]Z/1 in the reduction of 3-nonen-2one afforded 2-nonanone in 92% yield [compare with 95% yield using 10:1 ratio (Table 1, entry 1, method B)]. In conclusion, the catalytic system generated in situ from 1 and di-tert-butyl peroxide is 9 effective for the operationally simple and mild selective hydrogenation of the carbon-carbon double bond in a,unsaturated carbonyls, sulfones and phosphonates in good yields. This methodology is superior (a,13-unsaturated carbonyls), comparable (phosphonates), or inferior (sulfones) to that involving 1 and oxygen. 3. Experimental 3.1. General ' H-NMR spectra were obtained on a Gemini 200 MHz spectrometer using CDCI 3, as the solvent and Me4Si as the internal standard. A VG 7070E spectrometer was used for mass spectral determinations. GC analyses were carried out on a Varian star 3400 instrument, equipped with a column packed with 1.5% OV17 + OV-21 0 on Chromosorb W-HP (100-120 mesh). 3.2. Typical procedure for the hydrogenation of a,(3-unsaturated carbonyls, sulfones and phosphonates Di-tert-butyl peroxide (15 mg, 0.1 mmol) was added to a solution of THF (5 ml) containing 1 (8 mg, 0.01 mmol). The solution was stirred for 30 min at 60 and became clear yellow. 3-Nonen-2-one (70 mg, 0.5 mmol) was added to the catalytic solution, and hydrogen was bubbled through the stirred reaction mixture at room temperature. The reaction was monitored by gas chromatography, and after 1 h, the reaction was filtered through neutral alumina and the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation. 2-Nonanone (67 mg, 95%) was isolated by distillation and characterized by comparison of spectral data [IR, NMR(' H, 13C), MS] with those for an authentic sample.
