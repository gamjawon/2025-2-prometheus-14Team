Budapest (Hungary) Summary Multistep thermal activation of alumi-na-supported Mo(N0)=C12L2 (Li = py, OPPh3) and M(CO)3X2LZ (M = Mo, W; X = Cl, Br; L2 = PPh3, AsPh3) complexes was attempted, supposing that their decompositions follow the patterns previously determined by DTA measurements. Thermolysis products of. Mo complexes, such as MoC12L2, MOOC12, MoC12 and MoOC12L2 were inactive for propene. metathesis, while tungsten complexes gave active catalysts when heated at 70 -12U C in vacuum. Their activity was a discontinuous function of the loading of the tungsten complex on the alumina- and the activation temperature- Based on IR, DTA, kinetic and stereochemical considerations, two isomers of W(CO)XZL22 species having no direct links to the alumina are assumed as active species. The conversion of the coordinated CO into organic carbonyl derivatives is regarded to be a vital step in the initiation process. Introduction The oxidation state and coordination environment of the catalytically active transition metal atom have been of great interest since the discovery of the olefin metathesis reaction. Most of the difficulties in elucidation of this problem arose from the fact that the reactions of the precursors (i.e. the transition metal complex, the organometallic co-catalysts and the occasional activators) in the activation process were unknown in detail. Studies in this field were concentrated mainly on either the reducing [1j or Lewis acid character [2, 3) of the co-catalysts. Complexes isolated from the reaction mixtures did not help much because they were complexes of tungsten and molybdenum in quite different oxidation states (Q - VI) and nearly all of them gave again an active combination with the co-catalyst; [4]. 0304-5l02/a2/0000-0000/$02.75 Elsevier SequoiafPrinted in The Netherlands 124 As one of the early examples, coordinatively unsaturated [MOC12py2] species, derived from the reaction of Mo(NO)2C12py2 and EtAIC12 by the elimination of the nitrosyl ligands, was assumed as an active moiety [5] . Later, studies based on the preparative isolation of Mo(NO)(CO)2CILZ-complexes from the above catalytic system [6] and kinetic data [ 7] proved the presence of an PTO group in the coordination sphere of the catalytically active transition metal atom. However, direct evidence supporting or denying the catalytic activity of coordinatively unsaturated MX2L2 species in olefin metathesis has not yet been presented. in the present work kinetic, derivatographic, infrared and stereochemical studies have been applied to obtain information on the catalytic nature of MX2L2 arid related species stabilized on an alumina surface. Experimental Ketjen CK 3C0 7-A1203 (particle size 0.2 - 0.4 mm) support was pretreated with oxygen at 500 C and evacuated at the same temperature. It was impregnated with saturated CH2C12 solution of the precursor complexes at room temperature. Chernisorption capacity of the alumina surface for each compound was slightly different; in the case of W(CO)3CI2(AsPh3)2 it was ^- 11.8 wt9o. Following the impregnation, the catalysts were filtered off and pumped dry. To make oversaturated catalyst an additionai amount of CH2C12 solution of the precursor was added to the already saturated carrier and the solvent was evaporated under vacuum with continuous stirring. All the preparations were carried out in the absence of air and moisture. The precursor complexes were prepared as previously described [8 - 10] and details of their therrnal analyses are reported elsewhere [11, 12] . The kinetic experiments were carried out in a closed all-glass recirculation system. The catalyst was activated in vacuum at the temperatures given. Polymerization grade propene was degassed after liquefaction with liquid air. It was circulated through the catalyst at atmospheric pressure, and the change in the composition was determined by gas chromatography (Instrument: Pye Unicam, Ser. 104; coiumn: 1.5 X 2.3 mm ID, packed with Durapa.k n-octane/Porasil C (120/150 mesh). Column temperature: 25 C; detector: flarne ionization; carrier gas: nitrogen at 25 ml/min; internal standard: propane.) The IR spectra were determined by a Perkin Elmer 577 double beam grating spectrometer. Films of 8 - 10 mg/cm2 `thickness' were pressed from alumina powder and were treated similarly as described for the preparation of the catalys. Results and discussion The Mo-NO bond in Hughes' Mo(NO)ZC12L2 type catalyst precursors s exceptionaLy strong. Nitric oxide cannot be expelled from the molecule in 125 its original form; the NO has to be reduced before the Mo-NO bond is broken [111 . The central atom itself may act as a reducing agent through an intramolecular redox reaction. The general sequence of these thermally initiated reactions is shown in eqn. (1): 300 C 350 - 400 C Mo(NO)2C12Lz - [MOOC12L21 -1rL,Q -2Li 450 - 850 C [M00C12] M003 + MOOC14 (1) Since the course of the reaction and the decomposition temperatures are not significantly altered in the presence of A1203, the above decomposition products are bound to the surface at the appropriate temperatures. Formation of MoC12L2 species, however, cannot be achieved in this way. To obtain such derivatives either the intramolecular redos reaction of Mo(NO)2C12Lz complexes, eqn. (2), containing easily oxidizable ligands such as PPh3 or AsPh3, 190 - 280 C _300 C Mo(NO)2C12L2 -N2 [MOC12(OL2)2) -2o Lo [MOC12] (2) or the multistep thermal decarbonylation of MO(CO)3Cl2L2 complexes, eqn. (3), could be applied [12] . 175 C _225 C Mo(CO)3C12(PPh3)2 -2CO - PMo(CO)Cl2(PPh3)2j - o 350 C [rvIOC12(PPh3)2l -' [MOC12) (3) -2PPh~ In order to avoid possible redox side reactions, such as oxygen transitions from N to Mo or from P(As) to Mo, carbonyl complexes were mostly employed for catalyst preparations of this kind. The catalytic studies on molybdenum derivatives gave rather poor results. Nitrosyl derivatives activated below 360 C gave no sign of catalytic activity at all; neither the original form of the precursors, nor the MOOC12Lg species catalysed the metathesis of propene. The low activity that was obtained after activation of the Mo(NO)2C12py2/A1203 starting material at 360 C might be attributed rather to a small amount of Mo03 than to the MOOClz moieties. This assumption follows from the high activity obtained with the same catalyst when it was converted into oxide at 550 C in oxygen, in spite of considerable loss of Mo content through sublimation of oxyhalides. The higher activity in the case of the pyridine complex array be due to the higher Mo content remaining on the surface after the treatments (Table 1). The results with Mo(CO)3Ci2(PPh3)2/A12O3 preparations were no better. The effect of the alumina surface and the reduced pressure applied at activation significantly lowered the temperature of decarbonylation.

According to the IR spectrum of the catalyst, at 150 C decarbonylation of the starting complex was complete and at 180 C slow decomplexation of DPh3 could be observed as it condensed on the cooler parts of the reactor. Mostly FLMO(CO)Cl2(PPh3 )2 ] , [MOCl2(PPh3 )Z ] and a mixture of [MOC12(PPh3)2j a-nd [MOC12] moieties cover the alumina surface after the vacuum treatments at 80, 120, and 180 C, respectively. The W(CO)3X2LZ type complexes bound to the surface gave golden yellow materials. When the surface was totally covered it contained approximately 12 wt9o of the complexes. The catalysts were activated in vacuum at 40, (75)82, 100, 120, 150 and 180 C, and their catalytic activity was tested at 80 C after each activation step. Characteristics of the various catalyst preparations are listed in Table 2. The activity of the catalysts was a sensitive function of the activation temperature; the rate of metathesis was low in preparations activated below 70 C, it was highest and approximately constant between 80 - 100 C, decreased signiEcantly at 120 C and fell to zero at 150 C (Fig. 1). According to eqn. (3), in this last stage the surface of the catalyst cars be regarded as covered with [ WX2L2 ] species. Neither these moieties nor their further decomposition products could be thermally activated again, unless converted into a tungsten oxide type catalyst at higher temperature in an oxygen atmosphere. 127 TABLE 2 Rate of metathesis of prdpene over W(CO)gX2L2/AI203 catalysts Precursor complexes Concentration Rate T-aaslcis of the complexes mol s i (g cat)-f ratio in in the preparation product wt9o but-2-enes w(CO)3C2(ASPh3)2 s_2 - - W(c0)3cl2(ASP63)2 11.8 0.3 x 10-g - W(C0)3Cl2(14sPh3)2 17.0 4.3 x 10-8 1.33 W(CO)3C12(AsPh3)2 17.Ob 1.0 x 10 10 - W(C0)3Cl2(PPh3)2 17.0 5.4 x 10-9 1.55 w(CO)3Br2(PPit3)2 17.0 1.3 x 10-g 1.42 'Activation at 80 C in vacuum; propene metathesis at 80 C in recirculation system (initial pressure of propene= 1 bar). bA mixture of alumina and complex. The most active among the supported catalysts of this kind was that made from the phosphine derivative. On changing the substituents for bulkier ones, e.g. phosphzine for arsine, or chloride for bromide, the reaction rate decreased while the cis-content of the product butenes slightly increased. The trQUsleis ratio remained constant in the conversion range studied (max. 2%) and was characteristic of the catalyst used ('fable 2). These ratios are far from the equilibrium value (2.47 at 80 C [13] [131), but cis-trans isomerizattion has not been detected. In order to clarify the role and the possible participation of the alumina support in the formation of active moieties, catalytic experiments were carried out with different loading of the W(CO)3Cl2(AsPh3)2 complex on A1203 support. It is important to note that metathesis of propene was not observed by using alumina alone. On increasing the quantity of the precursor supported on the alumina, no catalytic activity was achieved until the chemisorption capacity of the carrier had been fully saturated. The chernisorbed part, therefore,- at least 2/3 of the complex in the case of a I7% preparation, remained inactive. In other words, the alumina seems to have a poisoning effect in this case and acts simply as a surface enlarger after full coverage has already been obtained. The disadvantageous orientation of the chemisorbed molecules has also been taken into consideration. Synthesis of W(C0)3Cl2(PPh3)2 was carried out on the alumina surface in two alternative ways. First, aluOa was saturated with PPh3, dried, and reacted with W(C0402 dissolved in acetone. In the second experiment the alumina was treated first with a solution of W(CO) C12 in acetone, filtered off, and then reacted with a solution of PPh3 in hexane. The complex is practically insoluble in tile reaction media, so the preservation of the two partially different orientations of the molecules on the alumina surface might be assumed. Both preparations, however, proved 128 0.50 I 0.2 5 IP 0 30 60 90 120 Reaction time(min) Fig. 1.

On the basis of this result the assumption that the disadvantageous orientation of the complexes on the carrier surface is responsible for the inactivity can be ruled out. A mechanical mixture of alumina and W(CO)sClz(AsPh3)2 was made and used for the metathesis of propene under the sane conditions as the catalyst preparations. The mixture was active and gave the same trams/cis isomer ratio in product butenes as the supported one. The activity of the mixture however was very-modest- It .vas impossible to decide whether the smaller complex-surface interaction or the smaller surface area was responsible for the lower activity_ Nfetathesis oa linear and cyclic olefins was attempted using homogeneous solutions of the formerly tested nitrosyl and carbonyl complexes as unimoleeular catalysts: O, o of cis, fares-pent-2-ene was converted into butenes and aexenes in boiling peniene/chlorobenzene solution in the presence odissolved W(CO)S- 123 C12(PPh3)2. Norbornene and norbornadiene were converted into high molecular weight unsaturated polymers with 60 - 957o yield in boiling benzene solution of W(CO)3Cl2(AsPh3)2 (8 X 10- mol/1) within 5 - 20 min reaction time- Rapid cross-metathesis of norbornene or norbornadiene with terminal olefins such as hex-l-ene or octa-I,7-diene was achieved under the above conditions [I4j . These results indicate that the alumina support has no vital role in formation of the active species in this case- The activity of Mo(CO)3C12(PPh3)2 under identical homogeneous conditions was very poor, as expected. It was inactive in metathesis of pent-2ene but gave a very low yield in ring-opening polymerization of norbornene (turnover number = 5)_ The nitrosyl complexes, however, were entirely inactive when used in place of carbonyl complexes either under heterogeneous or homogeneous conditions. The activation process of a O(C0r3Cl2(AsPh3)2/A1203 type oversaturated (1 7 wt%o) catalyst was followed by IR spectroscopy; the results are shown it Fig. 2. The spectrum of the alumina (pretreated at 550 C in vacuum) is free from disturbing absorptions in the vC0 range. Decomposition of the complex could already be observed during the impregnation and solvent evaporation process. The main terminal vC0 bands were broadened, especially due to the additiona: absorptions of the dicarbonyl species at 1960(w) and 1875(s) cm-1. Traces of tri- and dicarbonyl derivatives (weak bands at 2020 - 30, 1930 and 1875 cry f) were still present after activation at 70 0C for four hours, and two new broad absorption bands appeared in the low vC0 region (1 710 and 1680 cm-! ).

On evacuation of the catalytic system these new bands disappear without the regeneration of the former ones. Carbonyl groups indicated by the broad, low bands at 1710 and 1680 cm -1 in the IR spectrum of t-he activated catalyst might be of great importance in formation of active species. To account for such low uC0 frequencies, W-C=O-Al type complegation had already been postulated by Biihou and coworkers in the case of LW(CO)s complexes supported on chlorinated alumina f 15] . In our case such interpretation is hardly applicable, because this type of interaction with regard to the poisoning effect of the carrier would account for deactivation rather than such high activity- The absorption bands most probably belong to bridging CO ligands, but the participation of the alumina in this association can be excluded, provided that the remaining coordinated CO is involved in the formation of the active species. The formation of the two new vC0 bands under catalytic conditions at 1770 and 1735 cm -1 is very significant. These bands are of too low frequencies for CO bridging between two tungsten atoms and too sharp for W-C=O-Al type bridges, but fall very well in the range of organic carbonyl groups. Identification of several organic carbonyl derivatives as by-products of W(CO)3C1zLz-initiated metathesis reactions is in progress [14] . Conclusions Alumina-supported coordinatively unsaturated MC1zL2 type molybdenum and tungsten complexes were inactive in the heterogeneous metathesis of nropene. Thermal decomposition of alumina-supported W(CO)3X2Lz complexes resulted in active catalysts when heated at 70 - 120 C in vacuum. Their activity was a discontinuous function of the amount of tungsten complex loaded on the alumina and the activation temperature. Based on IR and BTA studies [W(CO)X2L2] species having no direct links to the alumina surface are assumed as active moieties. Above 150 C, catalytically inactive [ WX2 LZ ] is formed with the complete loss of CO. Raising the temperature further does not change the complex to an active form again until it is convertO into a conventional oxide-type catalyst in an oxygen atmosphere at higher temperature. We conclude that the initiation mechanism in the two active stages are entirely different. This is also emphasized icy the opposite behaviour of the support in that it is a poison in the first active stage and an activator it the later one. The conversion of coordinated CO into organic carbonyl derivatives is considered to be a vital step in the formation of the initiating carbenes. 131 Acknowledgement The authors wish to express their grateful acknowledgement to the late Dr- E_ Detrekoy for the careful determination of the Fly spectra- References 1 L.

        "dc:description": "Multistep thermal activation of alumina-supported Mo(NO)2Cl2L1 2 (L1 = py, OPPh3) and M(CO)3X2L2 2 (M = Mo, W; X = Cl, Br; L2 = PPh3, AsPh3) complexes was attempted, supposing that their decompsotions follow the patterns previously determined by DTA measurements. Thermolysis products of Mo complexes, such as MoCl2L2 2, MoOCl2, MoCl2 and MoOCl2L1 2 were inactive for propene metathesis, while tungsten complexes gave active catalysts when heated at 70 – 120 °C in vacuum. Their activity was a discontinuous function of the loading of the tungsten complex on the alumina and the activation temperature. Based on IR, DTA, kinetic and stereochemical considerations, two isomers of W(CO)X2L2 2 species having no direct links to the alumina are assumed as active species. The conversion of the coordinated CO into organic carbonyl derivatives is regarded to be a vital step in the initiation process.",
