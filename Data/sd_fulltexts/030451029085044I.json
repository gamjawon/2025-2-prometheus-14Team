STEVENSON*, MASUHIKO ARAI**, SCOTT A. GODDARD, and J. A. DUMESICf Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 (U.SA.) (Received February 24, 1989; accepted June 6,1989) Summary The catalytic activities of graphite-, carbon black-, alumina-, and silica-supported metallic iron catalysts for the hydrogenolysis of ethane were measured. Turnover frequencies varied over a range of three orders of magnitude. Carbon black-supported catalysts prepared from ferric nitrate had higher activities than carbon black-supported catalysts prepared from Fe3(CO)ia, the latter having been shown to have more spherical and possibly more widely separated metallic iron particles within the pore structure of the carbon black support. The low catalytic activity of the cluster-derived catalyst may be due to the spherical morphology of the iron particles, giving rise to highly unsaturated iron surface atoms and altering the nature of the catalytic ensembles present, or to a partial coverage of the iron surface by carbon from the support. The iron carbonyl-derived catalyst was also inactive for support gasification in hydrogen, while the conventionally-prepared catalyst almost completely gasified the carbon support during treatment in hydrogen at 773 K for 2 h. Introduction Previously we have discussed the preparation and characterization of carbon- and alumina-supported iron catalysts, examining the effect of support and preparation on metallic iron particle size and morphology [1] and adsorptive behavior [2J. We observed that the nature of the support and the preparation method had a significant effect on the resulting sample. Because these samples had iron particles of different size and shape, and because these particles displayed different adsorptive properties with respect to CO, we chose to study their reactive properties with a structure- *Present address: Institut flir Physikalische Chemie der Universitat Miinchen, Sophien- strasse 11, 8000 Munich 2, F.R.G. \" Present address: Chemical Institute of Non-Aqueous Solutions, Tohoku University, Sendai 980, Japan. fAuthor to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/90/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 246 sensitive reaction, ethane hydrogenolysis (e.g., [3-5]). Additionally, we observed during the course of this study that the propensity of iron toward carbon gasification varied between samples; these observations are also reported here. Experimental Sample preparation Three samples were prepared using triiron dodecacarbonyl in hexane in a water- and oxygen-free atmosphere: 0.95 wt.% Fe/carbon black (Cabot CSX-203, surface area 1400 n^g\"1), prepared by wet impregnation; 0.36 wt.% Fe/graphite (Ultra Carbon UCP-1-200, Sn^g\"1), prepared by incipient wetness impregnation; and 0.36 wt.% Fe/AlgOs (American Cyana- mid, l^n^g\"1), prepared by wet impregnation. The details of the prepara- tion and handling of these materials have been presented elsewhere [1]. Two samples were prepared by aqueous impregnation with ferric nitrate: 4.67 wt.% Fe/carbon black (Cabot CSX-203), and 5%Fe/Si02 (Davison 952). Ethane hydrogenolysis kinetic measurements Ethane hydrogenolysis activities were determined in a glass apparatus following the procedure of Sinfelt [6]. Ethane (Matheson, 99.99%, used as supplied), hydrogen (99.8%, further purified by a Deoxo unit and a molecular sieve trap maintained at 77 K), and helium (99.998%, further purified by copper turnings at 523 K followed by a molecular sieve trap at 77 K) were mixed in the ratio 3:20:77. Each activity measurement was made after the sample had been exposed to the ethane-containing gas mixture for 3 min; the sample was regenerated in a 20/80 hydrogen/helium mixture for 10 min between measurements. Temperatures between 575 and 660 K were used for the activity measurements on all catalysts except the 0.95% carbon black- supported catalyst, prepared by wet impregnation of Fe3(CO)i2 and reduced at 773 K, where the range 700 to 763 K was used. Exit gas concentrations were measured with a Carle gas chromatograph using a Porapak Q column and a thermal conductivity detector. Conversions were not allowed to exceed 2% and were in most cases much lower. Turnover frequencies were calculated on the basis of particle sizes estimated by magnetic susceptibility and CO chemisorption [1]. Carbon gasification measurements The extent of support gasification for the 4.67% Fe/carbon black sample was determined gravimetrically. About 3-5 mg of sample was placed in a Cahn 2000 microbalance, where the mass change was determined during the treatment in hydrogen. In addition, support gasification was verified qual- itatively by a gas chromatograph, which could detect any methane formed during reduction. 247 Results Ethane hydrogenolysis kinetic measurements The results of the kinetic studies are summarized in Table 1, where the activity per gram of catalyst, turnover frequency and apparent activation energy are presented. The metallic iron particle sizes estimated by magnetic susceptibility measurements [1] are also reported in this Table. A 10-min regeneration period in Ha/He flow between measurements was sufficient to maintain stable activity for all catalysts, with the exception of the alumina- supported sample. This catalyst deactivated during exposure to ethane, and the activity could be only partially recovered by treatment in Ha/He at the reaction temperature. Following reduction at 673 K, the activity of the carbon black-supported sample prepared by impregnation of Fe^CO)^ was too low to be measured without exceeding the reduction temperature. Following reduction at 773 K the temperature of the activity measurements was increased, and the apparent activation energy in this region was used to extrapolate the results to the lower temperature range. Carbon gasification The graphite-supported catalyst and the carbon black-supported ca- talyst prepared from the iron carbonyl cluster showed no activity for support gasification during treatment in hydrogen at temperatures of up to 773 K, either as observed gravimetrically or by the production of methane as observed with the gas chromatograph. In contrast, the carbon black- supported sample prepared from ferric nitrate gasified 15% of the catalyst support when treated in hydrogen at a temperature of 723 K and 95% of the catalyst support at a temperature of 773 K.

''Extrapolated from 740 K. 248 Discussion As can be seen from Table 1, the ethane hydrogenolysis turnover frequencies of the samples studied span almost three orders of magnitude, with the conventionally-prepared carbon black-supported sample the most active, and the cluster-derived iron on the same support the least active. The variation in catalytic activities cannot be explained by diffusional limitations, since this would alter the apparent activation energy [7, 8], and no such decrease is observed. Furthermore, the turnover frequencies are too low for transport limitations to be important. Differences in particle size may be the origin of the turnover frequency variation. If this is true, however, the relation between turnover frequency and particle size is not simple. For example, the highest turnover frequency is observed for an intermediate particle size; this is in agreement with the work of Yates and Sinfelt on supported Rh [3]. However, the iron particle size on alumina is similar to that on carbon black (prepared by wet impregnation), while the turnover frequencies for these two samples vary by a factor of 40. Finally, it must be noted that all samples possess an iron particle size distribution [I], which makes it less likely that particle size alone is responsible for the observed variation in catalytic activity. Two additional explanations for the results of this study are that (1) the various catalysts possess metallic iron particles with different shapes, and (2) the iron particles on the cluster-derived carbon black catalysts are partially covered by surface carbon. The first possibility, different particle shapes, is suggested by Mossbauer spectroscopy and chemisorption data [1, 2]. The iron particles present in the cluster-derived carbon black-supported sample were more spherical in shape than those in the other carbon-supported catalysts. This possible difference in metallic iron particle morphology could be related to the observed difference in activities; the large ensembles required for hydroge- nolysis are more likely to be found on the flat particles present on the graphite- and conventionally-prepared carbon black-supported catalysts than on the small, spherical particles present in the cluster-derived carbon black-supported sample. Indeed, changes in activity of several orders of magnitude have been found for ethane hydrogenolysis over the same catalyst with different pretreatments [9, 10], and these variations were attributed to changes in surface crystal planes. According to the second possible explanation for the wide variation in activities, a relatively low surface coverage by carbon would be sufficient to decrease the catalytic activity, but not diminish the capacity of the metal to adsorb CO. The amorphous carbon within the pore structure of the carbon black is of higher thermodynamic activity than the graphitic external surface of carbon, and it is therefore more likely to cover the iron surface. Since the impregnation with iron carbonyl deposits iron more uniformly throughout the pore structure of carbon black than does incipient wetness impregnation with ferric nitrate, the iron particles in the former catalyst may be in more 249 effective contact with the amorphous regions of the support, and thus more effectively covered by carbon. Another striking difference between the behavior of the carbon- supported cluster-derived catalysts and the conventionally-prepared carbon black-supported catalyst is the resistance of the former samples to support gasification during treatment in hydrogen at high temperatures. While the cluster-derived catalysts did not measurably gasify the support at tempera- tures up to 773 K, the sample prepared from ferric nitrate showed significant activity for support gasification at 723 K and almost completely destroyed the support when reduced in hydrogen at 773 K. Previous workers have also reported support gasification in similar samples [11-14]. One of the possible explanations for the above effect is that the metallic iron particles are larger and generally in closer proximity to each other on the conventionally-prepared carbon black-supported sample, and it is known that carbon gasification in hydrogen is more effectively catalyzed by larger iron particles [15]. Furthermore, the iron particles on this sample become larger as they move, collide and sinter during gasification. This leads to an even greater increase in the gasification rate. From the wide variation in activities for ethane hydrogenolysis, despite similar activation energies, and the differences in support gasification of the carbon-supported iron catalysts, it is clear that variations in catalyst preparation have led to iron particles exhibiting greatly different reactive properties. These differences can be attributed specifically to changes in particle morphology and/or coverage of the iron particles by surface carbon. Regardless of whether one or both of these processes are causing the changes in the reactive properties of the catalysts, our results support the major points that the nature of the support and method of catalyst preparation are important in determining catalytic properties for structure-sensitive reac- tions such as ethane hydrogenolysis and support gasification.
