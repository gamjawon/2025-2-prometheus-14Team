Graphical abstract The isomerization of caryophyllene oxide, one of the most widespread sesquiterpenes found in various essential oils, is catalyzed by the acidic Cs salt of tungstophosphoric heteropoly acid, Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40, to give rare polycyclic oxygenated sesquiterpenes with a clovane structure. Cloven-9-ol and clovan-2,9-diol can be obtained with up to 80% combined selectivity and 60% individual selectivity each (under different reaction conditions), which is the best result reported for these compounds so far. The process is environmentally benign and can be performed not only in conventional solvents such as 1,2-dichloroethane and acetone but also in eco-friendly “green” organic solvents such as dimethylcarbonate, diethylcarbonate and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran. The reactions occur under ambient conditions at low catalyst loadings without catalyst leaching. The solid catalyst can be simply centrifuged from the reaction mixture, and low boiling solvents can be separated from reaction products by distillation. Keywords Biomass-based feedstock Isomerization Heterogeneous catalysis Heteropoly compounds Caryophyllene oxide 1 Introduction Terpenes are found in nature in essential oils of plant materials, often as main constituents. Natural terpenes and their synthetic derivatives are very important for perfumery, pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries [1–3]. In particular, many value-added terpenoids are industrially produced through the acid catalyzed transformations of more abundant terpenes [1–3]. In most of these syntheses, large amounts of hazardous mineral acids are still used as homogeneous catalysts, which results in serious pollution and corrosion problems. The development of sustainable and environmentally benign processes based on the application of solid acid catalysts is very important for terpene chemistry as it allows for extending the commercial use of easily affordable and bio-renewable essential oils. Heteropoly acids (HPAs) of the Keggin series, such as H3PW12O40 (HPW), are widely recognized as attractive and green acid catalysts for many important processes in fine chemistry [4–6]. Due to the strong Brønsted acidity and high chemical stability, HPAs usually show better catalytic performance than traditional acid catalysts, e.g. mineral acids, zeolites and clays. Supported HPAs can be used as heterogeneous catalysts in non-polar and weakly polar media without leaching problems. On the other hand, for heterogeneous catalysis in polar solvents, where HPAs are highly soluble, their insoluble acidic salts represent excellent alternatives [7–10]. In particular, several examples of successful use of Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 (CsPW), a compound with strong Brønsted acidity and large surface area, as a heterogeneous acid catalyst have been reported [11–16]. Caryophyllene oxide (1), one of the most widespread sesquiterpenes, is found in various essential oils, such as clove or lavender oils [17,18] (Scheme 1 ). Caryophyllene oxide can also be obtained synthetically by the epoxidation of β-caryophyllene, the main hydrocarbon component of clove and copaiba oils [17–19]. Due to the recognized biological activity of caryophyllane compounds, the copaiba oil is traditionally used in popular medicine and plays an important role in the Brazilian export of pharmaceutical products [19]. Caryophyllane derivatives are also widely used as aromatic ingredients (woody, floral, fruity) in perfumes, food and tobacco products [2,18]. Caryophyllene and its derivatives have an unusual structure with a cyclobutane ring fused in a trans manner with a nine-membered ring (Scheme 1). The skeletal rearrangements of these compounds could provide access to rarer sesquiterpenoids, for example, to the compounds with caryolane and clovane tricyclic structures [17]. However, the development of selective reactions involving caryophyllenic substrates is a highly challenging task as these strained molecules undergo a variety of transformations with a remarkable facility. Probably for this reason, the reports on selective catalytic reactions of caryophyllanes are scarce in the literature. In particular, it has been reported that the acid-promoted transformations of caryophyllene oxide usually result in a complex mixture of polycyclic products due to trans-annulation reactions [20–25]. Some of these products are shown in Scheme 1. Only few reports described reasonable selectivities for individual products (usually less than 30–40%). In most of those works hazardous homogeneous catalysts or large over-stoichiometric amounts of solid acids were used to promote the transformations of caryophyllene oxide. For example, diol 3 was detected as a preferential product in acetone solutions of sulfuric acid [20,25]. Allylic alcohols 5 and 6 were major products formed from caryophyllene oxide in acetone or DMSO solutions in the presence of highly toxic tetracyanoethylene as the catalyst [23]. The formation of ketone 7 as a major product was detected at the isomerization of caryophyllene oxide in toluene solutions over FeSO4 or Zr(SO4)2 [21]. The reaction over sulfated silica gave mainly dienes 8 and 9, whereas the reaction over sulfated alumina gave allylic alcohol 6 or aldehyde 10 depending on the conditions applied [25]. For several years we have concentrated our efforts on the catalytic transformation of terpenic compounds, in particular, acid catalyzed transformations. As a result, we have reported several successful applications of heteropoly acid catalysts in liquid-phase reactions, such as isomerization [14,26,27], esterification/etherification [16,28,29] and cycloaddition [15,30]. In the present work, we investigate the silica-supported HPW and its Cs salt, CsPW, as heterogeneous catalysts for the isomerization of caryophyllene oxide. These reactions are performed in various liquid media, including environmentally friendly non-toxic organic solvents (so-called ‘green’ solvents) such as dimethylcarbonate (DMC), diethylcarbonate (DEC) and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MeTHF). To our knowledge, no attempt to use HPA catalysts for this reaction has been made before. Moreover, as far as we know, none of the previous works has achieved such high selectivities for the products with the clovane framework. 2 Experimental 2.1 Chemicals All chemicals were purchased from commercial sources and used as received, unless otherwise stated. Caryophyllene oxide [(−)-caryophyllene oxide] (Scheme 1) from Aldrich was used as the substrate. As shown by NMR, the commercial sample contained only one isomer, 4α,5β-epoxycaryophyll-8(13)-ene [31,32]. H3PW12O40 hydrate, MeTHF, DEC and DMC were from Aldrich and Aerosil 300 silica from Degussa. Before some runs (specially indicated in the Tables), commercial DMC was treated to remove water, at least partially, by distillation under argon and storing over molecular sieve (4 Å) activated for 3 h at 100 °C. 31P MAS NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature and 4 kHz spinning rate on a Bruker AVANCE DSX 400 NMR spectrometer using 85% H3PO4 as a reference. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the catalysts was performed on a Rigaku Geigerflex-3034 diffractometer with CuKα radiation. The textural characteristics were determined from nitrogen physisorption measured on a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 instrument at 77 K. Tungsten and phosphorus content was determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP atomic emission spectroscopy) on a Spectro Ciros CCD spectrometer. The 20 wt% H3PW12O40/SiO2 catalyst (HPW/SiO2) was prepared by the impregnation of Aerosil 300 (SBET, 300 m2 g−1) with an aqueous HPW solution. The material was dried at 130 °C/0.2–0.3 Torr for 1.5 h, as described previously [33]. The HPW content determined by ICP was 20 wt%. The specific surface area determined by the BET method was 200 m2 g−1. The average pore diameter and the single point total pore volume were 144 Å and 0.53 cm3 g−1, respectively. The 31P MAS NMR spectrum of the catalyst displayed only a single peak at ca. −15 ppm characteristic of HPW confirming the integrity of the Keggin structure [34]. XRD analysis showed that most of HPW was finely dispersed on the silica surface, with only small amounts of HPW crystalline phase detected. The acidic heteropoly salt CsPW was prepared according to the literature procedure [35] by adding dropwise the required amount of the aqueous solution of cesium carbonate (0.47 M) to the aqueous solution of HPW (0.75 M) at room temperature with stirring. The precipitate obtained was aged in an aqueous mixture for 48 h at room temperature and dried in a rotary evaporator at 45 °C/3 kPa and after that in an oven at 150 °C/0.1 kPa for 1.5 h. The surface area of thus prepared CsPW was 111 m2 g−1, pore volume 0.07 cm3 g−1, and pore diameter 24 Å (Fig. S1). The acid strength of CsPW was characterized calorimetrically using ammonia and pyridine adsorption as discussed previously [36]. The reactions were run under air in a 10 mL glass reactor equipped with a condenser. Typically, a mixture (5.0 mL) of caryophyllene oxide (0.38–2.25 mmol), dodecane (0.50 mmol, GC internal standard) and the catalyst (HPW/SiO2 (5–15 mg, 0.35–1.05 μmol of HPW) or CsPW (5–50 mg, 1.5–15.0 μmol)) in a specified solvent was intensely stirred with a magnetic stirrer at a specified temperature (5–60 °C). The reactions were followed by gas chromatography (GC) using a Shimadzu GC2010 instrument fitted with a Carbowax 20 M or Rtx®-5MS capillary column and a flame ionization detector. The mass balance, conversion and product selectivity were calculated based on dodecane as the internal standard without using GC response factors. Any difference in the mass balance was attributed to the formation of high-boiling products not detected by GC. Turnover frequencies (TOF) were measured by GC at low conversions (up to 30–50%) by taking aliquots at short reaction times (usually within first 30–60 min), unless otherwise stated. To verify catalyst leaching, the catalyst was separated by centrifugation (20 min, 18 000 rpm), another portion of caryophyllene oxide was added to the supernatant and the reaction was allowed to proceed further. The tungsten content in the supernatant was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (Hitachi-Z8200 spectrometer). The products were separated by column chromatography (silica gel 60) using mixtures of hexane and CHCl3 as eluents and identified by GC–MS, 1H, and 13C NMR. The 1H and 13C NMR signals were assigned using bidimensional techniques. NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 using a Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer, with TMS as an internal standard. Mass spectra were obtained on a Shimadzu QP2010-PLUS instrument operating at 70 eV.

Compound 12 has been described elsewhere [37]. Atom numbering generally accepted for caryophyllane and clovane derivatives [17] are shown in Schemes 2 and 3 . GC retention times on both highly polar (Carbowax 20 M) and low polar (Rtx®-5MS) columns follow the order: 7 < 1 < 2 < 6 < 5 < 12 (appears only on the Rtx®-5MS column) < 4 < 3. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Isomerization of caryophyllene oxide in nonpolar solvents Representative results for the transformations of caryophyllene oxide (1) over HPW/SiO2 in different solvents are shown in Table 1 . In cyclohexane and iso-octane solutions, the reactions were performed at 60 °C due to the limited solubility of caryophyllene oxide in these media at lower temperatures. The conversion of caryophyllene oxide was relatively fast even in the presence of small catalyst amounts (0.1–0.2 mol% of HPW); however, the reaction became stagnated after 80–85% conversion (Table 1, runs 1–3). Increasing the reaction time did not allow converting the rest of the substrate (Table 1, run 1). GC analysis revealed the formation of a complex mixture of products. Compounds 2, 3 and 7 were isolated from the reaction solutions by column chromatography and identified by NMR spectroscopy. The structures of minor products 5 and 6 were suggested based on their mass spectra, which closely matched with those described previously ([31] and [23], respectively). Five identified products accounted for ca. 80% of the mass balance and could be grouped in two series: compounds 2 and 3 with a tricyclic clovane skeleton and compounds 5, 6 and 7 in which the original caryophyllane structure remains intact. Cyclization products, clovenol 2 and clovanediol 3, were formed due to the trans-annulation of the nonane carbon cycle with two minor cycles; whereas elimination products, allylic alcohols 5 and 6 and ketone 7, resulted from the protonation/deprotonation of caryophyllene oxide without any skeletal rearrangement. The combined selectivity for the identified clovane derivatives was ca. 50% and for the caryophyllane derivatives ca. 30%. The best individual selectivity of ca. 40% was obtained for clovenol 2, formed as a major product in all the runs presented in Table 1. In blank tests at 40 °C (with no catalyst or with pure silica added) in all the solvent used in the present work practically no conversion of caryophyllene oxide was observed for 3 h. As confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, caryophyllene oxide used as the substrate in our work was free from other isomers. The spectra closely matched those reported for the 4α,5β-isomer (1a) shown in Scheme 3 [31,32], in agreement with the manufacturer. It was observed that under the reaction conditions used, the starting isomer of caryophyllene oxide was partially converted into another stereoisomer, 1b (4β,5α-, 4α,5α- or 4β,5β-isomer), characterized by a slightly longer retention time on the polar Carbowax column. On the low polar Rtx®-5MS column, the two stereoisomers of caryophyllene oxide were not separable. In all the runs reported in the present work, only stereoisomer 1b remained in reaction solutions after 80–90% conversion, whereas the original isomer (1a) was completely consumed. The nature of 1b was confirmed by mass spectroscopy; however, its stereochemistry was not clarified. We failed to isolate the remaining caryophyllene oxide after the reaction because it underwent chemical transformations under the conditions of column and thin-layer chromatography. 3.2 Isomerization of caryophyllene oxide in 1,2-dichloroethane In nonpolar solvents, cyclohexane and iso-octane, the reaction occurred at similar rates (Table 1, cf. runs 1 and 3) and with similar product distributions. Then the reaction was performed in more polar solvent, 1,2-dichloroethane, where caryophyllene oxide is better soluble. As HPW is insoluble in 1,2-dichloroethane, the HPW/SiO2 catalyst can be used as a heterogeneous catalyst without any leaching problems [15]. The caryophyllene oxide conversion in 1,2-dichloroethane was much faster than in nonpolar media (Table 1, runs 4 and 5 vs. runs 1–3). At 30 °C, the reaction was finished in 0.5 h showing turnover numbers (TONs) of ca. 300 (Table 1, run 4). The combined selectivity for five identified products was ca. 80% with nearly the same product distribution as in cyclohexane and iso-octane. The highest individual selectivity of 45% was observed for clovenol 2. The CsPW catalyst was also tested for the reaction in 1,2-dichloroethane (Table 1, run 6). Similarly to what was observed with HPW/SiO2, the reaction became stagnated at nearly 80% conversion, with all the remaining caryophyllene oxide being detected as less reactive stereoisomer 1b. The advantage of using CsPW was an increase in the amounts of the clovane products as compared to caryophyllane products (from ca. 2.4/1 to 3.7/1). CsPW and 20%HPW/SiO2 catalysts are quite similar in their acidity (both the nature (i.e. Brønsted) and the strength) [13b]. They differ in hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of their surface: rather hydrophobic CsPW and hydrophilic HPW/SiO2 [11b]. Hence they will differ in their adsorption ability toward the substrate, intermediates and solvents, which compete for the adsorption sites. The explanation for different product distribution at the isomerization of caryophyllene oxide with these two catalysts probably involves their different adsorption behavior. 3.3 Isomerization of caryophyllene oxide in acetone solutions Further we tested the reaction in highly polar acetone solutions with CsPW, which is virtually insoluble in acetone, in contrast to HPW. The reaction times presented in Table 2 for most of the runs corresponded to complete conversion of the original stereoisomer of caryophyllene oxide. The reaction with 2 mol% of CsPW occurred rapidly at 30 °C and 1a was completely consumed in 30 min (Table 2, run 1). GC analysis on the Carbowax column showed that all unconverted substrate was present as 1b, which remained intact during the next 30 min under reaction conditions. On the other hand, GC analysis on the Rtx®-5MS column revealed that approximately half of 1b existed as an adduct with acetone (compound 12 in Scheme 3) during the reaction in acetone solutions. Compound 12 was isolated by column chromatography and characterized by NMR spectroscopy, with its NMR spectra perfectly matching those described previously [37]. It should be mentioned that the caryophyllene oxide/acetone adduct, acetal 12, undergoes complete decomposition under GC analysis on the Carbowax column to give caryophyllene oxide isomer 1b. The decrease in catalyst loading proportionally decelerated the reaction and improved the total selectivity for five identified products from 82 to 95% (Table 2, run 3 vs. runs 1 and 2). We observed a strong preference for the formation of the clovane derivatives in acetone solutions with a clovanes/caryophyllanes ratio of 4.5/1. At 40 °C, the reaction was still highly selective; however, at 50 °C the selectivity began to decrease (Table 2, runs 4 and 5). Clovanediol 3 was formed in acetone solutions with up to 60% selectivity, which is the best result reported so far. The combined selectivity for clovane products 2 and 3 was ca. 75%. The CsPW catalyst was perfectly stable under reaction conditions showing TONs up to 1800 (Table 2, runs 3–7). The TON values and turnover frequencies (TOF) were calculated considering the total amounts of protons in the CsPW catalyst, whereas the real catalytic activity of the surface active sites available for the substrate was probably higher. Formally, clovanediol 3 is the product of the addition of water to the caryophyllene oxide molecule accompanied by its skeletal rearrangement. Thus we expected that the presence of water might affect the product distribution and run the reaction at different water concentrations (Table 2, runs 8–10). However, the addition of 1 equiv. of water (with respect to the substrate) decelerated the reaction (Table 2, run 8 vs. run 3; run 9 vs. run 2). The addition of 10 equivalents of water completely deactivated the catalyst and suppressed the caryophyllene oxide conversion (Table 2, run 10 vs. runs 2 and 8). The product distribution and the relative amounts of clovane derivatives 2 and 3 were very similar in the runs with different water concentrations, clovanediol 3 being a major product formed in ca. 55% selectivity. This result is quite unexpected and seems to be related with the high nucleophilic activity of water, even residual water, in acetone solutions. It should be mentioned that in most of the runs water was not specially added to the reaction solutions. The amounts of hydration water present in the catalyst and commercial caryophyllene oxide and solvents were sufficient for the formation of clovanediol 3. 3.4 Isomerization of caryophyllene oxide in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MeTHF) solutions Encouraged by promising results with the CsPW catalyst, we directed further efforts to find green alternatives for the solvents used in these reactions, acetone and 1,2-dichloroethane. 2-Methyltetrahydrofuran (MeTHF) has recently attracted much attention as an environmentally benign biomass derived solvent in catalysis, organic synthesis and pharmaceutical chemistry [38,39]. MeTHF is produced from renewable sources such as furfural or levulinic acid available from lignocellulosic biomass. Abiotic degradability, low toxicity and better stability compared to other ether solvents are among the important advantages of MeTHF [38,39]. The conversion of caryophyllene oxide occurred more slowly in MeTHF than in acetone, with the initial TOFs being approximately 6 times lower under the same conditions (run 1 in Table 3 vs. run 3 in Table 2). The reaction was roughly first order with respect to the catalyst as similar TOF values were observed in the runs with 5, 15 and 25 mg of CsPW (Table 3, runs 1, 2 and 3). Under nearly ambient conditions with 1 mol% of CsPW, the substrate conversion reached 90% within 3 h (Table 3, run 3). All unconverted caryophyllene oxide appeared on the chromatogram as stereoisomer 1b. The combined selectivity for five identified products 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 in MeTHF was nearly 90%, with their selectivities being only slightly affected by reaction temperature (Table 3 runs 4, 5 and 6). The solvent nature influenced remarkably the product distribution: in MeTHF, clovane and caryophyllane derivatives were formed in comparable amounts, whereas in acetone the clovane products accounted for up to 80% of the mass balance. On the other hand, the individual selectivity for clovenol 2 in MeTHF reached 40%, which is, to our knowledge, the best result reported for this compound so far. MeTHF is presently considered as an eco-friendly alternative for rigorously regulated chlorinated solvents as it displays better performance in several important organic reactions [39]. Our work represents another proof that MeTHF can be a superior solvent compared to 1,2-dichloroethane. MeTHF and 1,2-dichloroethane have similar polarity with a dielectric constant (ε) of 7.0 and 10.4, respectively. However, in contrast to 1,2-dichloroethane, MeTHF possesses a strong Lewis basicity, which could decrease the catalyst acid strength. Nevertheless, the isomerization of caryophyllene oxide occurred in MeTHF solutions at nearly the same rate as in 1,2-dichloroethane (run 3 in Table 3 vs. run 6 in Table 1). Although in both solvents clovenol 2 was formed as a major product in 40–45% selectivity, the reaction in general was more selective in MeTHF. Combined selectivity for the five identified products was 95% in MeTHF, whereas only 80% in 1,2-dichloroethane at the expense of minor unidentified products (run 3 in Table 3 vs run 6 in Table 1). 3.5 Reactions in dimethylcarbonate (DMC) and diethylcarbonate (DEC) solutions Dimethylcarbonate (DMC) and diethylcarbonate (DEC) represent additional options to replace acetone and 1,2-dichloroethane in the isomerization of caryophyllene oxide. Due to the biodegradability and low toxicity, organic carbonates have recently gained much attention as green reagents and solvents in catalysis and organic synthesis [40–42]. Both DMC and DEC belong to the group of aprotic, low polarity and weakly basic solvents with relatively low boiling points (ε = 3.1 and b.p. = 90 °C for DMC; ε = 2.8 and b.p. = 126 °C for DEC). The conversion of caryophyllene oxide in DMC solutions occurred slightly slower than in acetone, however, much faster than in MeTHF and 1,2-dichloroethane. The initial TOFs under the same conditions were ca. 4 times higher than in MeTHF (runs 1, 3 and 4 in Table 4 vs. runs 3, 1 and 4 in Table 3, respectively) and 1,2-dichloroethane (run 1 in Table 4 vs. run 6 in Table 1) and only 30–40% lower than in acetone (runs 2 and 3 in Table 4 vs. runs 2 and 3 in Table 2, respectively). The remarkable feature of the reaction in DMC solutions was a high individual selectivity of 60% for clovenol 2. The best selectivities reported previously for the formation of this compound from caryophyllene oxide were only 20–25% [21,25]. The combined selectivity for five identified products 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 was higher than 90% in most of the runs performed in DMC. As expected, temperature decrease decelerated the reaction, but did not affect significantly reaction selectivitiy (Table 4, runs 4–7). However, at 40 °C, the reaction mass balance declined due to the formation of high boiling compounds which were not detectable by GC (Table 4, runs 8 and 9). Increasing reaction temperature and reaction time did not allow for complete conversion of substrate, which remained in the final reaction mixture as stereoisomer 1b. Such remarkable inertness of 1b compared to 1a has a precedent: an exceptional stability of caryophyllene oxide to base (even to caustic soda at 150 °C [43]) has been previously observed and explained by the conformation of the nine-membered ring which prevented the epoxide ring from attack by an external nucleophile [17]. The rate of the caryophyllene oxide conversion in DMC was roughly first order in catalyst as the initial TOFs calculated per mol of protons in CsPW were only slightly different in the runs with different catalyst amounts (Table 4, cf. runs 1, 2 and 3; runs 4 and 7; runs 5 and 6). In attempts to improve the selectivity for clovenol 2 vs. clovanediol 3, which is formally the product of water addition to clovenol 2, we ran the reaction in a dry DMC (DMC was distilled under argon and stored over activated molecular sieves). The runs in dry DMC occurred at slightly higher rates than with the undried DMC (Table 4, cf. runs 10 and 4; runs 11 and 5). The amounts of clovanediol 3 decreased only slightly but instead a new product, compound 4, appeared in significant amounts (ca. 25%) at the expense of clovenol 2, whose selectivity decreased to ca. 35%. (Table 4, runs 10 and 11). Compound 4 was isolated from the reaction solutions and identified as methyl ether of clovanediol (Schemes 1 and 2) previously reported as one of the products formed from caryophyllene oxide in methanol solutions containing catalytic amounts of tetracyanoethylene [23]. The source of methoxy groups in our reaction could be only DMC itself acting as a methoxylation agent under nearly anhydrous conditions. It should be mentioned that the formation of ether 4 was only detected in the dried DMC. Addition of 1 equiv. of water deteriorated reaction selectivity (Table 4, cf. runs 12 and 4). Thus, the reaction in DMC solutions was highly sensitive to the presence of water similarly to what was observed in acetone. It should be mentioned that clovandiol 3 was detected in small amounts (with 12% selectivity) even when the reaction was performed in dried DMC. We suppose that the amounts of hydration water present in the catalyst and commercial caryophyllene oxide and residual water from the solvent were sufficient for the formation of this product. The CsPW catalyst could be easily separated by centrifugation and reused. In run 2 (Table 4), the catalyst was reused two times after washing with chloroform without significant decrease in activity and selectivity. The tungsten content in the supernatant determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy corresponded to less than 1.5% loss of CsPW. A new portion of caryophyllene oxide was added to the supernatant and the reaction was allowed to proceed further with no additional substrate conversion being observed. Diethylcarbonate (DEC), which displays the same basicity and slightly lower polarity than DMC [42], can also be used as the solvent for the reaction of caryophyllene isomerization (Table 4, runs 12–14). Similar selectivities and slightly lower reaction rates were observed as compared to the reactions performed in DMC (Table 4, cf. runs 13 and 8; runs 15 and 2). As CsPW is insoluble in low polar DEC and DMC, leaching problems under reaction conditions are not expected in these systems. 3.6 Reaction mechanism A suggested reaction mechanism for the acid-catalyzed transformations of caryophyllene oxide 1 is presented in Schemes 4 and 5 . Protonation of the oxygen atom in the substrate results in opening the epoxy ring to give carbocation A. Cyclization products 2, 3 and 4 with a clovane structure form via the rearrangement of carbenium ion A into B as shown in Scheme 4. This involves trans-annular ring closure through the nucleophilic attack of the exo-cyclic double bond at carbon C4 (with the formation of a new C4–C13 bond) followed by four-membered ring expansion into the more stable five-membered ring (with the C1–C9 bond cleavage and new C1–C8 bond formation). Nucleophilic attack of water or DMC on carbenium ion B gives the corresponding addition products 3 and 4, whereas the loss of proton from C10 gives clovenol 2. The cationic species thus formed from DMC can further react with traces of water to give monomethylcarbonate and regenerate proton. The products with a caryophylene structure 5, 6 and 7 are formed directly from carbenium ion A by the elimination of proton from C3, C12 and C5, respectively (Scheme 5). The ratio between the cyclization (2 + 3 + 4) and elimination (5 + 6 + 7) products reflects the possibility for primarily formed carbenium ion A to be stabilized in the reaction medium, in particular, by a nucleophilic solvent. Thus, varying the solvent nature allows for the proportion between the clovane and caryophyllane products to be changed significantly from nearly 1 (Table 3) to nearly 5 (Table 2). 4 Conclusions The acidic Cs salt of tungstophosphoric heteropoly acid, Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40, is an active and environmentally benign solid acid catalyst for the isomerization of caryophyllene oxide in liquid phase to give a range of rare polycyclic oxygenated sesquiterpenes potentially useful for fragrance and pharmaceutical industries. The reaction can be performed not only in conventional solvents such as 1,2-dichloroethane and acetone but also in non-toxic easily degradable “green” organic solvents such as dimethylcarbonate, diethylcarbonate and biomass derived 2-methyltetrahydrofuran. Compounds with a tricyclic clovane structure, clovenol 2 and clovanediol 3 (both natural products [31]), were obtained with up to 80% combined selectivity and 60% individual selectivity each (under different reaction conditions), which is, to our knowledge, the best result reported so far. The reactions occur under nearly ambient conditions at low catalyst loadings without catalyst leaching. The solid acid catalyst can be simply centrifuged from the reaction mixture, and relatively low boiling points of the solvents allow for their easy removal from the reaction products by distillation.
