S. GNEP, J. Y. DOYEMET and M. GUISNET UA CNRS 350, Catalyse en Chimie Organique, Universite de Poitiers, UFR Sciences, 40 avenue du Recteur Pineau, 86022 Poitiers Cedex (France) (Received August 21, 1987; accepted January 5, 1988) The exchange by Ga3\"1\" of the zeolite HZSM5 leads to catalysts which are more active and above all much more selective for the transformations of light alkanes into methylbenzenic hydrocarbons than the HZSM5 zeolite [1-5]. Propane aromatization has been studied on HZSM5 by various authors [1, 6] and a reaction scheme has been proposed. The first stage is the formation of propene; this olefin by a series of reactions (oligomeriza- tion, cyclization, hydrogen transfer) leads to aromatic hydrocarbons. The cracking of oligomers gives light olefins which, like propene, participate in the formation of aromatics. 12 4 5 C3Hg > CaHfi > Oligomers > Alicyclics > Aromatics + 3 C^-Cg C^-Cy Ce-Cc ^ , C2H4, C4Hg, C5Hio As propene reacts much faster than propane [6, 7], it is quite likely that stage 1 is the limiting stage of the reaction process. Stages 1 to 5 can be catalyzed by the acid sites of the HZSM5 zeolite. In stage 1 a carbonium ion would intervene, in the other stages it would be only carbenium ions [1, 6]. According to Kitagawa et al., [1] the gal- lium species would intervene in the aromatization of oligomers (stages 4 and 5) and would not play any part in the propane activation stage (stage 1). On the other hand Ga3\"1\" cations could be the active species. The aim of this comparative study of propane conversion on HZSM5, on gallium oxide and on the physical mixture, is to discuss these two conclusions. The transformation of propane was carried out in a flow reactor under the following operating conditions: reaction temperature 530 C, propane pressure 1 bar, catalyst weight: HZSM5 (0.2 g), Ga^Oy (0.2 g), equal-mass mixture of HZSM5 and of Ga^ (0.4 g). The weight of reactant injected per weight of catalyst and per hour (WWH) was equal to 2 for measuring the activity, and was varied from 0.5 to 80 in order to obtain the product 0304-5102/88/$3.60 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 282 distribution at various conversion rates. Analysis conditions have already been reported [6]. The conversion of propane on HZSM5 (0.2 g) is twice as high as on gallium oxide (0.2 g). It is slightly higher on the equal-mass mixture of HZSM5 and gallium oxide (0.4 g) than on HZSM5 (0.2 g). On gallium oxide, the products of propane transformation are essentially composed of propene (70 wt.%) and of an equimolar mixture of , mostly olefinic (>90%), and of Ci. On HZSM5 and on the equal-mass mixture, the transformation products are; methane, ethane, ethylene, propene, butanes, butenes, aliphatic or cyclic Cs-C7 compounds and aromatic hydrocarbons C^-Cg. The distribution of these products is quite different, however (Fig. 1). The addition of Gai03 to HZSM5 causes a decrease in the quantities of methane, ethane, butenes, butanes and non-aromatic Cs-C7, but a definite increase in the quantity of aromatics. The selectivity of the equal-mass mixture is, like its activity, completely different from that expected if propane reacted independently on Gaa03 and on HZSM5. On the other hand, Ga203 added to HZSM5 has the same effects as those caused by exchange of the zeolite HZSM5. The species active in propane aromatization can therefore be the gallium of Ga203 in an intimate mixture with the zeolite or the Ga3\"1\" cations exchanged in the zeolite. Gallo-silicates of a pentasil structure being also good catalysts in the formation of methylbenzenes [3, 4], the active Ga species could also be the gallium of the zeolitic network. The results obtained with the mixture of Ga203 and HZSM5 show the transformation of propane on GaHZSM5 is a reaction of bifunctional catalysis [8], as is the hydroisomerization and hydrocracking of alkanes on Pt zeolites [9] or the dehydrocyclodimerization of propane on PtHZSM5 [6, 10, 11] or on PtAl203 [12]. The gallium species and the acid sites operate independently, the reaction intermediates migrating in gas phase between the two types of sites. The addition of Ga203 to HZSM5 favours the formation of aromatics at the expense of the formation of oligomers and their cracking products. In agreement with Kitagawa et al. [l], we can conclude that the gallium species favour the aromatization of oligomers (stages 4 - 5) at the expense of cracking (stage 3). However, it is not certain that the gallium species participate in all the reactions implicated in stages 4 and 5; indeed in the conditions for aromatization of propane, gallium oxide is practically inactive in the transformation into aromatics of n-heptane, n-heptenes or n-hexenes. Its participation is quite probably limited to the dehydrogenation of the alicyclic compounds (stage 5); under the same conditions on gallium oxide, the formation of toluene from methylcyclo- hexane and above all from methylcyclohexene can be observed. Moreover, the fact that gallium oxide has practically no activity in the transformation of propane into 4. shows that gallium species play no part in stage 2. On the other hand, the great activity of gallium oxide in propane dehydrogenation indicates that the gallium species participate in propane activation (stage 1). Moreover, it is this participation in the limiting stage of propane transformation alone which justifies an explanation for 283 10 - Conversion X (%) 0 25 50 Conversion X (%) 2.5 ^/ ^-c 0 25 50 Conversion X (%) 0 25 50 Conversion X (%) ' 4II 3VIi2^ lm - e .^-\":^^UtUfi i ..-K 0 25 50 Conversion X (%) 0 25 50 Conversion X (%) $-^ if) uCQ u r-14-' 0.5i, ac0c 0 g/^ Aa-^i . 25 50 Conversion X(%) ,12 l 8 . 4 0 25 50 Conversion X (X) Fig. 1.
