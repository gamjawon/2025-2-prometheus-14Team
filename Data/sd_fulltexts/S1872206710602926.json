A FE-SEM image of the nickel hexacyanoferrate showed that it consists of nearly spherical particles with sizes ranging from 30 to 70 nm. The synthesized material was found to be a heterogeneous catalyst useful for the solvent-free oxidation of benzyl alcohol with H 2 O 2 as an oxidant. A 36% conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde was achieved under optimized reaction conditions using specific parameters such as the amount of catalyst, the temperature, the benzyl alcohol to H 2 O 2 molar ratio, and the reaction time. Key words: hexacyanoferrate nanoparticle; heterogeneous catalyst; benzyl alcohol; benzaldehyde During the last few years, nanomaterials have made a big impact because of their potential applications in various inter- disciplinary areas including biological diagnosis, biomedicine, controlled drug delivery, enzyme immobilization, biosensing, magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic memory devices [1,2]. Therefore, the synthesis of nanomaterials of different compositions is important. Numerous nanomaterials based on various metals and metal complexes have been synthesized over the last decade [3,4]. Among the inorganic materials, transition metal hexacyanoferrates belong to a class of impor- tant coordination complexes exhibiting several outstanding characteristics such as water insolubility, mixed valency, high ionic conductivity, and excellent redox mediator properties [5â€“7]. Most of these materials possess microporous, polynu- clear, and open channel structures [8,9]. These highly insoluble materials do not dissolve upon oxidation or reduction because their zeolitic structure allows for the diffusion of ions, which maintains electrical charge neutrality [10]. Because of these characteristics, these materials are used for the preparation of molecular magnets, optical devices, rechargeable solid state batteries, electrochromic devices, adsorbents, and ion-exchangers [11,12]. These materials have shown promising for use in the voltammetric determination of a number of molecules of environmental and biological interest including glucose, ascorbic acid, dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, È•-NADPH, insulin, morphine, paracetamol, hydrazine, thi- osulfate, nitrate, phosphate, etc. [13â€“19]. Metal hexacyan- oferrates have been used as catalysts for the polymerization of ethylene oxide to commercially important polymers [20,21]. Chen et al. [22] reported the catalytic importance of zinc hex- acyanoferrate for the manufacture of polyether polyols. Metal hexacyanoferrates have also been found to be potential cata- lysts for the copolymerization of carbon dioxide and propylene oxide [23]. In all these areas, metal hexacyanoferrates have been exploited in their conventional form because their nano- chemistry has not been well studied to date. However, a few Shah R. ALI et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1844â€“1849 reports are available on the synthesis of certain metal hexa- cyanoferrate nanoparticles and their use as sensors [24â€“30]. Because nanomaterials exhibit vastly improved properties compared with their bulk materials of the same composition, we are interested in synthesizing nanoparticles of metal hexa- cyanoferrates and to explore their catalytic activities. Previ- ously, we reported the growth of zinc hexacyanoferrate nanocubes and their catalytic potential for the solvent-free oxidation of benzyl alcohol under heterogeneous conditions [31]. Recently, a few researchers have also used heterogeneous catalysts for different chemical reactions [32â€“34]. Chlo- rine-free benzaldehyde is an industrially important molecule because of its use as a starting material for the synthesis of odorants, flavors, and many pharmaceuticals. In this paper, we describe the synthesis of nickel hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles and their use as heterogeneous catalysts for the solvent-free oxidation of benzyl alcohol. 1 Experimental 1.1 Synthesis of nickel hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles K 3 [Fe(CN) 6 ].H 2 O, Ni(NO 3 ) 2 .6H 2 O, KCl, ethylenediamine- tetraacetic acid (EDTA), and C 6 H 5 CH 2 OH were purchased from Merck and used as received. All chemicals were of ana- lytical reagent grade. Doubly distilled water was used throughout. Nickel hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles were synthesized using a reported method [17]. A 50 ml Ni(NO 3 ) 2 Â·6H 2 O solution (0.01 mol/L) containing an equimolar amount of EDTA was added slowly to 25 ml of K 3 [Fe(CN) 6 ]Â·H 2 O solution (0.01 mol/L) containing an equimolar amount of KCl with constant stirring at room temperature. After complete mixing, the reac- tion mixture was vigorously agitated for 5 min and then kept as such for 30 min. It was filtered on a Buchner funnel, washed thoroughly, dried at 60 Â°C overnight, crushed and sieved with a 100 mesh sieve. 1.2 Characterization The elemental composition of the synthesized material was recorded on an Elementar Vario EL-III CHNS analyzer and a Perkin Elmer atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Thermo- gravimetric (TG) studies were carried out using a Perkin Elmer analyzer (Pyris Diamond). The TG-DTA (differential thermal analysis) curve was recorded at a heating rate of 10 Â°C/min. All thermogravimetric measurements were performed in air using Al 2 O 3 as a reference. Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded using KBr films and a Perkin Elmer spectrophotometer. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was recorded on a Philips PW-1140/ 90 X-ray diffractometer. The surface morphology and particle size were analyzed using a Quanta 200 field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) instrument. A quantitative analysis of reaction products was carried out using a Ther- moelectron gas-chromatograph fitted with an FID detector and a HP-1 capillary column (30 mm Ã— 0.25 mm Ã— 0.25 È�m). Ul- trapure N 2 was used as a carrier gas (flow rate 1 ml/min). The injector temperature was 380 Â°C. The column temperature was programmed from 60 to 380 Â°C at a rate of 10 Â°C/min and held at the final temperature for 10 min. The detector temperature was 400 Â°C. 1.3 Catalytic activity measurements The catalytic activity of nickel hexacyanoferrate nanoparti- cles was evaluated for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol using H 2 O 2 as an oxidant. The effect of reaction parameters such as the C 6 H 5 CH 2 OH (BzOH):H 2 O 2 molar ratio, the amount of catalyst, the reaction time, and the temperature was studied. The reaction was carried out in a magnetically stirred round bottom flask fitted with a mercury thermometer and a reflux condenser. A small aliquot of the reaction mixture was re- moved periodically, centrifuged to remove the catalyst, and then subjected to quantitative analysis. The heterogeneity of the catalytic reaction was studied by a leaching experiment. The recovered catalyst was washed thoroughly with acetoni- trile followed by water and dried in an oven at 80 Â°C. The recovered catalyst was characterized again to confirm that the composition of the catalyst remained unaffected after the re- action. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Synthesis and characterization of nickel hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles Mixing a Ni 2+ solution with a [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3â€“ solution under the reaction conditions used in our experiments results in the growth of nickel hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles. Equimolar amounts of EDTA were added during the reaction and it probably facilitated the formation of nickel hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles with almost uniform shape and a definite size range. The same function of EDTA during the synthesis of cobalt hexacyanoferrate has been proposed by Qu et al. [17]. Ocana et al. [35] described the formation of a cobalt complex with EDTA and found that the effective concentration of cobalt ions decreased and resulted in the homogeneous precipitation of cobalt hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles. The composition of nickel hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles was determined by CHNS analysis, atomic absorption spectroscopy, and TG-DTA analysis, and the data are shown in Table 1. Table 1 shows that the elemental composition and thermogravimetric data are similar to the theoretical values that were calculated for Ni 3 [Fe(CN) 6 ] 2 Â·11H 2 O. The TG-DTA curves of nickel hexacyanoferrate are shown in Fig. 1. The curves show that nickel hexacyanoferrate de- Shah R. ALI et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1844â€“1849 composes slowly upon heating to nearly 100 Â°C and it de- composes at a relatively higher rate when heating from 100 to 190 Â°C. Nearly 26.4% mass loss was observed at up to 190 Â°C, which comes from the removal of water from the synthesized complex. Metal hexacyanoferrates liberate only water content on thermal heating to the above-mentioned temperature [36]. The curve did not show any significant mass loss upon heating from 190 to 270 Â°C. However, a drastic mass loss was found when heating the compound from 270 to 410 Â°C and a 63.8% mass loss was found at 410 Â°C. The additional mass loss of nearly 37.4% was due to the removal of the cyanide moiety only. No significant mass loss was observed upon further heating the compound from 410 to 700 Â°C. Around 36.2% of the residue remained at the end of the experiment. The synthesized nanoparticles were also examined by XRD (Fig. 2). The clarity and sharpness of the X-ray peaks indicate a highly crystalline structure for the synthesized material. The face centered cubic lattice structure of Prussian blue is char- acteristic of many other transition metal hexacyanoferrates. Therefore, nickel hexacyanoferrate is likely to have a face centered cubic lattice structure. The IR spectrum of the synthesized material is shown in Fig. 3(2). A strong peak is present at 2150 cm â€“1 , which is a charac- teristic peak of the CÅ�N group. The infrared spectrum also shows a peak at 446 cm â€“1 , which seems to correspond to Feâ€“C stretching. A broad band is also present at 3453 cm â€“1 , which comes from the Oâ€“H groups of the water molecule in the in- terstitial sites. In the IR spectrum of the recovered catalyst (Fig. 3(1)), three peaks were observed at 1811, 1870, and 1953 cm â€“1 , which might come from the phenyl ring overtone of benzyl alcohol. The peaks observed at 730 and 695 cm â€“1 come from the mono substitution of the phenyl ring. These additional peaks in the recovered catalyst come from the adsorption of trace amounts of benzyl alcohol. A FE-SEM image of the synthesized nanomaterial is shown in Fig. 4. It shows that the synthesized material consists of asymmetrical spherical particles with a size range of 30â€“70 nm. One part of the FE-SEM image shows agglomerated particles while the other part reveals particles with clear and well dis- Table 1 Elemental and thermogravimetric analyses of nickel hexacyan- oferrate Composition (%) Va l u e C N H Ni Fe H 2 O Theoretical 17.65 20.60 2.69 21.58 13.70 26.30 Observed 17.24 20.27 2.54 21.83 13.44 26.40 Recycled 17.31 20.41 2.43 21.46 13.53 26.10 0 1020304050 -1.0 -0.8 -0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 D T A ( m V ) Time (min) 60 80 100 120 140 160 T G ( % ) (1) (2) (3) 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 T e m p e r a t u r e ( o C ) Fig. 1.

Almost the same surface morphology and particle shape for nickel hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles was reported by Yang et al. [37]. 2.2 Catalytic activities Metal hexacyanoferrates have been reported to have high surface areas, mixed valencies, high ionic conductivities, ex- cellent redox mediator properties, microporous and open channel structures, and the ability to resist dissolution upon oxidation or reduction [8â€“10]. All these physicochemical properties favor the heterogeneous catalytic performance of nickel hexacyanoferrate. Nickel hexacyanoferrate nanoparti- cles were found to be good heterogeneous catalysts for the solvent-free oxidation of benzyl alcohol using H 2 O 2 as an oxidant. In the catalytic reaction mixture, only benzaldehyde was found as an oxidation product. A blank reaction that was performed over the catalysts under the same reaction condi- tions showed negligible oxidation of benzyl alcohol. No no- ticeable oxidation of benzyl alcohol was found in the absence of the catalyst, which indicates that H 2 O 2 alone is unable to oxidize benzyl alcohol. Generally, the catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol produces a mixture of benzaldehyde, benzoic acid, and benzyl benzoate. However, benzoic acid and benzyl benzoate were not obtained in the present study. Therefore, the catalyst was found to be highly selective. The formation of a tarry product was not taken into account because of its trivial quantity. The catalyst showed 36% conversion of benzyl al- cohol with 100% selectivity when 50 mmol benzyl alcohol was reacted with 100 mmol of H 2 O 2 (30%) in the presence of 30 mg catalyst at 75 Â°C over 4 h. The results of the catalytic reaction under different parameters are summarized in Table 2. The results show that a higher catalytic potential is obtained compared with nanocubic hexacyanoferrate, which gave nearly 28% conversion of benzyl alcohol under similar conditions [31]. Table 1 indicates that the composition of catalyst remains unaffected at the completion of the reaction. A tiny amount of catalyst was recovered after 30 min of the reaction and this was washed with acetonitrile twice followed by hot water. Its IR spectrum was recorded and the result is shown in Fig. 3(1). The strong peak at 2150 cm â€“1 is a charac- teristic peak of the CÅ�N group. These observations reveal that the phenyl ring and the OH group of benzyl alcohol do not insert into the coordination sphere but interact with the outer metal ion of nickel hexacyanoferrate and the inner coordination sphere remains intact. The interaction of the phenyl ring and the OH group with the outer metal ions of the hexacyanofer- rates is also evident from our previous studies on the adsorption of phenyl alanine on metal hexacyanoferrates [38]. Therefore, it is likely that benzyl alcohol and H 2 O 2 interact with nickel, approach it, and ultimately the product is generated. Based on IR studies, a possible reaction path is shown in Scheme 1. 2.2.1 Effect of the benzyl alcohol to H 2 O 2 molar ratio The conversion of benzyl alcohol was studied at BzOH: H 2 O 2 molar ratios of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3 and all the other reaction conditions were fixed (30 mg catalyst, 75 Â°C, 4 h). We found that the percentage conversion increased significantly upon increasing BzOH:H 2 O 2 from 1:1 to 1:2 while it remained al- most unaffected upon increasing the BzOH:H 2 O 2 ratio from 1:2 to 1:3. The results are shown in Fig. 5, which indicates nearly 20.0%, 36.0%, and 36.2% conversion at BzOH:H 2 O 2 molar ratios of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3, respectively. Therefore, a BzOH:H 2 O 2 molar ratio of 1:2 was found to be optimum. The conversion of benzyl alcohol may be correlated with the amount of oxygen librated upon the decomposition of H 2 O 2 . The amount of librated oxygen at a BzOH:H 2 O 2 ratio of 1:1 was not sufficient to oxidize the total number of active mole- cules of benzyl alcohol whereas it was sufficient at a BzOH: H 2 O 2 ratio of 1:2. For a BzOH:H 2 O 2 ratio of 1:3 the amount of librated oxygen exceeded its requirement for a complete reac- tion.

Nickel hexacyanoferrate catalyzed oxidation of benzyl al- cohol. Shah R. ALI et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1844â€“1849 2.2.2 Effect of the catalyst amount The effect of the catalyst amount on the conversion of benzyl alcohol was investigated by changing it from 10 to 40 mg and retaining all the other reaction conditions (BzOH:H 2 O 2 = 1:2, 75 Â°C, 4 h). The results are shown in Fig. 6. The conversion was found to increase significantly upon increasing the catalyst amount to 30 mg while it remained almost unaffected when increasing the amount of catalyst to 40 mg. The turnover fre- quency values (TOF = moles of substrate converted per mole of catalyst per hour) were found to be 163 and 123 h â€“1 for 30 and 40 mg of catalyst, respectively. Therefore, 30 mg of catalyst was found to be optimal. 2.2.3 Effect of temperature The effect of temperature on the conversion was determined by carrying out the reaction at 45, 60, 75, and 90 Â°C while all the other parameters were constant ((BzOH:H 2 O 2 = 1:2, 30 mg catalyst, 4 h). The conversion was found to increase upon increasing the temperature from 45 to 75 Â°C while it remained almost unaffected when increasing the temperature from 75 to 90 Â°C. The results are shown in Fig. 7, which indicates that 75 Â°C is most favorable. 2.2.4 Effect of reaction time Figures 5 to 7 show the effect of reaction time on the con- version of benzyl alcohol. The reaction of 50 mmol benzyl alcohol with 100 mmol of H 2 O 2 (30%) was carried out over 4 h in the presence of 30 mg of catalyst at 75 Â°C, which indicates that the conversion increased almost linearly with reaction time up to 120 min and then increased slowly from 120 to 180 min. The conversion was found to be nearly same for the 180 and 240 min experiments, indicating the constant conversion after 180 min. No appreciable change in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol was observed when running the reaction for 240 min. 2.2.5 Test for heterogeneity and recyclability The heterogeneity of the catalysts has been evaluated by a typical leaching experiment. The filtrate collected after sepa- rating the catalysts was placed in a reaction flask into which fresh H 2 O 2 was added. It was allowed to react for another 4 h under similar conditions. No significant conversion was ob- served after 4 h. The absence of metal in the filtrate of the reaction mixtures was confirmed by atomic absorption spec- troscopy. It showed that there was no metal leaching during the catalytic reaction, indicating the heterogeneity of the catalyst. The recyclability of the used catalysts was also evaluated. The reaction mixture was filtered after a contact time of 4 h. The catalyst was activated by washing with hot acetonitrile twice followed by doubly distilled water. The activated catalyst was dried in an oven at 80 Â°C.

ALI et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1844â€“1849 optimized conditions. We found that the conversion was nearly 35.6% for the first cycle. A minor loss of catalytic activity (1.2%) was found in the second cycle. 3 Conclusions Nickel hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles can be synthesized by mixing a solution of nickel ions with a solution of hexa- cyanoferrate ions. The addition of EDTA controls the forma- tion of nickel hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles with similar and uniform shapes and a definite size range. The synthesized nickel hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles act as a heterogeneous catalyst for the solvent-free oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. Under the optimized conditions, the conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde was nearly 36%. The cata- lyst gave 100% product selectivity for benzaldehyde.

Tel.: +91-5942-236943; Fax: + 91-5942-235576 Nickel hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles were synthesized and characterized using elemental analysis, thermal analysis, infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. A FE-SEM image of the nickel hexacyanoferrate showed that it consists of nearly spherical particles with sizes ranging from 30 to 70 nm. The synthesized material was found to be a heterogeneous catalyst useful for the solvent-free oxidation of benzyl alcohol with H2O2 as an oxidant. A 36% conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde was achieved under optimized reaction conditions using specific parameters such as the amount of catalyst, the temperature, the benzyl alcohol to H2O2 molar ratio, and the reaction time.
