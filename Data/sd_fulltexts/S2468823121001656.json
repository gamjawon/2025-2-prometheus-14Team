Graphical abstract We attempted to thoroughly investigate active sites of catalysts for oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) using SrLaXO4 (X = Al, Fe, or Co) catalysts with not only clear structures but also considerable catalytic activities. In this regard, various characterization tools at high-temperature conditions and at room temperature were employed. The results of characterizations clearly confirmed that oxygen properties of catalysts for OCM are considerably related to their catalytic activities in OCM. Concretely, adsorbed oxygen species (Oads) on the catalysts play the role of converting methane into methyl radicals. Herein, the methyl radicals are consecutively converted into ethane in the atmosphere, and the generated ethane molecules are additionally converted depending on lattice oxygen species of applied catalysts, which can be divided into nucleophilic lattice oxygen species (Olat(n)) and electrophilic lattice oxygen species (Olat(e)). Olat(n) is a favorable oxygen species for producing carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide from ethane, whereas Olat(e) functions as an oxygen species in the conversion ethane into ethylene. Consequently, we concluded that preparation of catalysts with abundant amounts of Oads and Olat(e) is a key strategy for achieving high performances in OCM. Keywords Oxidative coupling of methane A2BO4 perovskite-like structure Carbonate desorption Oxygen species Catalytic activity 1 Introduction Recently, shale gas is drawing increasing attention as the upcoming energy source [1,2]. For this reason, many researchers have actively attempted to efficiently convert methane (CH4), which is the main component of shale gas, into high-valued compounds such as methanol (CH3OH), ethane (C2H6), ethylene (C2H4), and aromatics [3–6]. Methods of converting of CH4 are generally divided into direct and indirect conversion methods. In the case of the direct conversion method, CH4 is directly converted into high-value compounds. Meanwhile, CH4 conversion proceeds through synthetic gas (carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas) in case of the indirect conversion method. Although the indirect conversion using synthetic gas is thermodynamically stable, reforming processes for synthesis gas require high temperature and a large amount of energy [7–9]. Thus, indirect conversion methods are generally considered to be methods that are not cost effective. Consequently, many researchers have focused on direct conversion methods and actively attempted to develop effective catalysts for the direct conversion methods [10–15]. Among direct conversion methods of CH4, oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) has recently attracted attention [16–21]. Herein, OCM is one of direct conversion methods of CH4 into C2 hydrocarbons such as C2H6 and C2H4. Research on development of effective catalysts for OCM has become one of the hottest research trends since the 1980s, but the selective conversion of CH4 into C2 hydrocarbons remains a challenging issue because of not only the chemical stability of CH4 but also the thermodynamically favorable formation of carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide (CO). Because of the stated challenging issues, there is no commercially available catalyst yet. Na2WO4/Mn/SiO2 has been reported as a catalyst for OCM exhibiting the highest C2 hydrocarbon yield among the catalysts studied for OCM and stability for several hundred hours under reaction conditions. For this reason, studies on improving the catalytic activities of Na2WO4/Mn/SiO2 have been actively conducted [22–26]. However, identification of active sites of Na2WO4/Mn/SiO2 catalysts on OCM is not yet fully understood because of their complex structure, leading a great deal of ambiguity concerning properties of the active sites. Considering that investigation of active sites of catalysts is one of most important for one to systematically and effectively design and prepare catalysts, more fundamental studies on identification of active factors of catalysts for OCM are required. Currently, in this context, catalysts with perovskite and perovskite-like structures have received attention as promising catalysts for fundamental studies on OCM owing to their relatively clear structure [27–30]. A perovskite-like structure is a layered perovskite structure with the A2BO4 formula. The perovskite-like structure of A2BO4 oxides is a structure in which an ABO3 perovskite and an AO rock salt are repeated, and it is a kind of a Ruddlesden − Popper phase. A Ruddlesden−Popper phase is a two-dimensional perovskite structure in which cations are inserted, and its general formula is An+1BnX3n+1 [29,30]. In general, A and B sites are composed to cation species, and X is composed of anion species. In addition, it is well known that the A2BO4 perovskite-like structure in which oxygen is inserted at the X site has various good characteristics such as superconductivity and ferroelectricity. From these advantages of A2BO4, the oxides have been actively applied to various fields including OCM as catalysts [31–33]. Therefore, we considered that A2BO4 oxides could be promising catalysts with high catalytic activities in OCM and a clear structure. Because there are various papers reporting that metal oxides composed of lanthanum (La) or strontium (Sr) showed considerable catalytic activities in OCM, in addition, we expected that A2BO4 oxides composed of La or Sr are good candidates for investigating active factors and achieving good catalytic activities in OCM. According to various studies on OCM, catalytic activities of catalysts for OCM are greatly influenced by distribution of oxygen species of the used catalysts [21,27–29,34–38]. Herein, oxygen species are divided into surface oxygen species and bulk oxygen species. Surface oxygen species can be additionally divided into adsorbed oxygen (Oads), nucleophilic lattice oxygen (Olat(n)), and electrophilic lattice oxygen (Olat(e)). In this context, many researchers have widely employed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which is one of powerful characterization tools of investigating distribution of surface oxygen species of the used catalysts. However, because characterization tools including XPS for confirmation of surface oxygen species are generally conducted at room temperature, we doubted that they could not easily give perfect information on surface oxygen species of catalysts for OCM at high temperature. Thus, although researchers in the OCM field agree that catalytic activities of catalysts for OCM is greatly related with oxygen species of the used catalysts, their opinions on roles of surface oxygen species in OCM have not unified yet. Particularly, the relationship between lattice oxygen species (Olat(n) and Olat(e)) and selectivities for C2 hydrocarbons and CO x is one of the hottest arguments in OCM. Consequently, it is important that clear characterization of surface oxygen species of catalysts at high temperature for investigating active factors and for effective preparation of catalysts good catalytic activities in OCM. In this study, we applied catalysts with a SrLaXO4 perovskite-like structure (X = Al, Fe, or Co) to OCM with the aim of investigating active factors for OCM. Furthermore, we attempted to solve issues of gaps in various properties of the catalysts at room temperature and high temperatures. In detail, we considered changes in properties of the catalysts with increasing temperature using various characterization tools, and we quantified amounts of oxygen species of the applied catalysts at high temperatures. Moreover, we compared the quantified oxygen properties with catalytic activities of the catalysts in OCM, and we clearly confirmed roles of oxygen species of the catalysts in OCM. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of SrLaXO4 catalysts As the calcination temperatures for phase formation of SrLaAlO4, SrLaFeO4, and SrLaCoO4 catalysts are different, SrLaXO4 catalysts were prepared under different preparation conditions in this study [39–41]. The SrLaAlO4 catalysts were synthesized using a citrate sol-gel method. Lanthanum nitrate (2.7 g, La(NO3)3, Sigma-Aldrich) and citric acid (7.2 g, C6H8O7, Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in 75.0 mL of distilled water. Aluminum nitrate (2.3 g, Al(NO3)3, Sigma-Aldrich) and strontium nitrate (1.3 g, Sr(NO3)2, Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved separately in 25.0 mL of distilled water. The aluminum solution and the strontium solution were added dropwise to the solution containing lanthanum nitrate and citric acid while the solution was being stirred vigorously. The prepared solution was stirred at room temperature for 1 h and evaporated at 80 ℃ to obtain a gel. Then, the gel was dried overnight at 200 ℃. The dry gel was ground, calcined at 475 ℃ for 10 min, and then calcined in a muffle furnace at 1300 ℃ for 10 h to obtain the SrLaAlO4 catalyst. The SrLaFeO4 and SrLaCoO4 catalysts were also prepared using the citrate sol-gel method. The two catalysts were prepared in almost the same way as the SrLaAlO4 catalyst, but the difference is that SrLaFeO4 catalyst was calcined at 1100 ℃ for 10 h, and SrLaCoO4 catalyst was calcined at 1000 ℃ for 10 h. 2.2 Characterization of the prepared SrLaXO4 catalysts Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on an X’pert-Pro PANalytical diffractometer (λ =1.54056 Å) for the assessed crystal structure of prepared catalysts. Herein, we obtained XRD patterns of the used SrLaXO4 catalysts as well as the fresh SrLaXO4 catalysts with an aim of confirming their structural stability in OCM. The Raman spectroscopy was carried out using a DXR2xi spectrometer (Thermo) with a 50–3500 cm−1 spectral range. Specific surface areas were determined via nitrogen adsorption−desorption analysis at 77 K using a BELSORP-max II constant volume adsorption apparatus (MicrotracBEL). The specific surface areas of the samples were calculated using the Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET) equation. The O 1s binding energies of the catalysts were verified by XPS using a K-alpha instrument (Thermo Fisher) equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source. The O 1s binding energies were calibrated against the C 1s peak at 284.5 eV. O 1s spectra of SrLaXO4 catalysts were deconvoluted into four peaks by assuming a peak that has a 100 % Gaussian shape. Temperature programmed desorption measurements (TPD) were carried out using a BELCAT B, which is conventional TPD instrument (MicrotracBEL). For TPD, each catalyst (0.05 g) was charged into a quartz reactor of the TPD apparatus and then pretreated at 200 ℃ for 1 h in a stream of helium (30 mL min−1). After being cooled at 35 ℃, the catalyst sample was purged with a stream of helium for 1 h. In addition, we applied another pretreatment condition at 775 ℃ for 1 h in a stream of helium (30 mL min−1) for TPD measurement. After being at 35 ℃, the catalyst sample was purged with a stream of helium for 1 h. The TPD profile was recorded from 35 to 950 ℃ at a heating rate of 10 ℃ min−1. The desorbed molecules were detected using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a mass detector (MS). Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed on FTIR-460 (Jasco). The samples were prepared using the KBr pellet technique, and infrared spectrum was recorded over the range of 4500 to 900 cm−1. 2.3 OCM reaction OCM was conducted using a continuous-flow fixed-bed micro-reactor with an internal diameter of 6 mm. The catalyst was loaded on the reactor by closing the upper and lower ends of the catalyst using the quartz wool. The reactor was heated to 775 ℃ under nitrogen flow. Then, nitrogen gas flow was changed to the reactant gas flow at 775 ℃. The reactant composition was fixed at the ratio of CH4:O2:N2 = 3:1:1 (v/v/v), and the total reactant volume flow rate was maintained at 20 mL min−1. The amount of catalyst was loaded at a gas hourly space velocity of 10,000 h−1. To remove water vapor products, a cold trap was employed. The gas products were periodically analyzed using an online gas chromatography system (YL-6500, Younglin) and detected by flame ionization and thermal conductivity detectors. The catalytic performance (CH4 conversion, C2 selectivity and COx selectivity) were calculated using the following Eqs. (1)–(3). The yield of C2 hydrocarbons was obtained by multiplying the CH4 conversion by the C2 selectivity.

We confirmed that the catalysts were successfully formed using JCPDS cards (SrLaAlO4: #81-0744, SrLaFeO4: #71-1745, and SrLaCoO4: #83-2408). As illustrated in Fig. 1 , all of the prepared catalysts showed characteristic XRD peaks of the A2BO4 perovskite structure. The A2BO4 perovskite structure has an alternating structure of ABO3 perovskite and AO rock salt, i.e., the SrLaXO4 catalysts were composed of AXO3 perovskite [(A = Sr or La) and (X = Al, Fe, or Co)], SrO, and LaO rock salt structures [29,30]. We additionally obtained XRD patterns of the used SrLaXO4 catalysts to confirm their structural stability in OCM. As shown in Fig. S1, SrLaAlO4 catalyst maintained its perovskite-like structure well, while the other catalysts (SrLaFeO4 and SrLaCoO4) showed structure changes during OCM reaction. According to previous studies on perovskites for OCM [29,38], the structure of some perovskite catalysts could be changed under COx conditions and specific temperature region. Hence, we assumed that these structure changes of SrLaFeO4 and SrLaCoO4 catalysts were occurred owing to COx generated during OCM at high reaction temperature, and accordingly, it could influence to their catalytic activities in OCM. Previous studies reported that the A2BO4 perovskite-like structure has Raman active modes of A1g. Herein, it is well known that the A1g peak relates to Sr/La vibrations along the c-axis [39–41]. According to our previous studies on OCM using perovskite catalysts [21,29], in addition, the properties of oxygen vacancy and oxygen species of perovskite and perovskite-like catalysts could be changed depending on their ionic sizes of constituent elements. Hence, we assumed that differences in size of Al, Fe, and Co resulted in the SrLaXO4 catalysts with different oxygen properties including Oads, Olat(e), and Olat(n). In other words, different oxygen properties of the SrLaXO4 catalysts were obtained from differences in ionic size of constituent elements (Al, Fe, and Co), which has a great influence on their catalytic behavior in OCM. Thus, we firstly conducted Raman spectroscopy to confirm the vibration modes of the prepared catalysts and the presence of Oads on the prepared catalysts (Figs. 2 and S2). In Fig. 2, Raman spectra on A2BO4 catalysts showed that all prepared catalysts had A1g peaks (approximately 223 and 470 cm−1). From these Raman spectra, it is confirmed that the prepared catalysts have well-formed A2BO4 perovskite structures. In addition, the SrLaAlO4 catalyst showed peaks at 301, 440, and 580 cm−1, which were not observed in the other catalysts. According to reports related to A2BO4 perovskites, Raman peaks at 301 and 440 cm−1 (Eg) relate to the O vibrations in the a–b plane, and the Raman peak at 580 cm−1 indicates oxygen vacancy (Ovac) on surface of catalysts [35,42–44]. Thus, we confirmed that the SrLaAlO4 catalyst has abundant Ovac on its surface. Consequently, we finally confirmed that SrLaXO4 catalysts were prepared as intended. 3.2 SrLaXO4 catalysts in OCM We applied SrLaXO4 (X = Al, Fe, or Co) to OCM as catalysts, and the obtained results are given in Fig. 3 and Table S1. The results of reaction activities in Fig. 3 were calculated as average reaction activities over 5 h. As illustrated in Fig. 3, notably, the three catalysts showed different catalytic activities, despite the catalysts having the same structure. The highest CH4 conversion rate was exhibited in the SrLaAlO4 catalyst, as approximately 31 %. The SrLaFeO4 catalyst and SrLaCoO4 catalyst showed CH4 conversion rates of 23 % and 18 %, respectively (Fig. 3(a)). Oxygen conversion rates were above 97 % for all of the catalysts (Table S1). To double-check the activity of SrLaXO4 catalysts in this reaction, we additionally calculated CH4 conversion based on C balance. As shown in Table S2, CH4 conversion of all prepared catalysts showed similar values within 3% of error. Moreover, comparison of the C2 yields of the prepared catalysts indicated that SrLaAlO4 catalyst had the highest activity, as C2 yield of 15 %. The SrLaFeO4 catalyst showed C2 yield of 7 %, and SrLaCoO4 catalyst exhibited 3 %. The C2 yield trend was the same as the CH4 conversion trend of the three catalysts. In particular, SrLaXO4 catalysts showed a significant difference in the selectivity ratio of CO and CO2, and at the same time, C2H6 and C2H4 selectivities showed a difference. Interestingly, no remarkable amounts of C3 or C4 hydrocarbons were produced in this study, although a little amount of C3 or C4 hydrocarbons could be produced in OCM. It was confirmed that total selectivities of the prepared catalysts were almost 100 % (Table S1). Through this result, we confirmed that SrLaXO4 (X = Al, Fe, or Co) catalysts had the same perovskite structure, but the activity behaviors were different. Therefore, to investigate the cause of the different catalytic activities of the catalysts, which is having the same structure, we attempted to investigate oxygen species, which are evaluated as the active factors of OCM, on the catalyst surface. 3.3 Investigation of active sites of SrLaXO4 catalysts on OCM 3.3.1 Active sites of CH4 conversion In accordance with many studies on OCM, oxygen in the feed gas is adsorbed onto Ovac on surfaces of the applied catalysts, and the adsorbed oxygen (Oads) sequentially converts methane into a methyl radical through a heterogeneous reaction. After then, the methyl radical produces ethane through homogeneous reaction [11,45–47]. This means that if there are abundant Ovac on surface of catalysts, the catalysts can show good CH4 conversion in OCM. Therefore, we predicted that SrLaAlO4, which showed abundant Ovac on its surface, could show the highest CH4 conversion in OCM among the prepared catalysts. To confirm the prediction, we compared the obtained Raman spectra and OCM results. In the comparison, we checked the SrLaAlO4 catalyst, which showed a Raman peak at 580 cm−1, indicating Ovac on the catalyst surface, and recorded the highest value of CH4 conversion among the prepared catalysts. The results agreed well with our prediction. Meanwhile, SrLaFeO4 and SrLaCoO4 performed different CH4 conversions in OCM. The SrLaFeO4 catalyst showed higher CH4 conversion than that of the SrLaCoO4 catalyst in OCM. Because the Raman peak at 580 cm−1, indicating Ovac on the catalyst surface, was not observed in Raman spectra of both SrLaFeO4 catalyst and SrLaCoO4 catalyst, the difference of CH4 conversion of SrLaFeO4 and SrLaCoO4 catalysts could not be explained with Raman spectroscopy. Consequently, we explained good CH4 conversion of the SrLaAlO4 catalyst in OCM through Raman spectroscopy. If catalysts do not show the Raman peak at 580 cm−1 in Raman spectroscopy, however, the method cannot explain CH4 conversion difference of catalysts for OCM. In other words, Raman spectroscopy is not enough to explain CH4 conversion difference of catalysts in OCM. Thus, we concluded that more characterization methods are required for explanation of relationships between CH4 conversion and oxygen properties of the prepared catalysts. Additionally, we obtained specific surface areas of the prepared SrLaXO4 catalysts. As shown in Table S3, the specific surface areas of the prepared catalysts were found to be ca. 1 m2 g−1, which is not considered to have a significant influence on the catalytic activity in this reaction [48,49]. 3.3.2 Active sites of selectivity of C2 hydrocarbons and COx It is generally accepted that OCM occurs simultaneously with a homogeneous reaction and a heterogeneous reaction. In the heterogeneous reaction, Oads on surfaces of catalysts plays a central role in forming a methyl radical by abstracting hydrogen from methane. Once the methyl radicals are generated, they are sequentially combined in a homogeneous gas phase to produce ethane. The ethane produced thereafter is converted into ethylene or into CO2 or CO, depending on oxygen properties of a used catalyst [11,29,34,35]. Particularly, it is reported that the electrophilic oxygen species (Olat(e)) produced ethane to ethylene, and the nucleophilic oxygen species (Olat(n)) convert ethane into a COx complete oxide [11,34,35]. In addition, in our previous study, we confirmed that selectivity for OCM varies depending on oxygen species of the catalysts [29]. Therefore, to investigate the relationship between oxygen species and catalytic activities of SrLaXO4 catalysts, the O 1s XPS spectroscopy was conducted (Fig. 4 ). Fig. 4 shows the O 1s XPS spectra of SrLaXO4 catalysts. The peak deconvolution performed indicates that all the catalysts contained the following four types of surface oxygen species: Oads (approximately 533.1 eV), carbonate (approximately 532.0 eV), Olat(e) (approximately 531.1 eV), and Olat(n) (approximately 528.8 eV) [34–37]. Additionally, the peak deconvolution results [fwhm, binding energy (eV), relative amount] are numerically presented in Table 1 . Through this result, we confirmed that all prepared catalysts had Oads, carbonate, Olat(e), and Olat(n) on the surfaces of the catalysts. The amount of Oads was found to be large in the order of SrLaAlO4, SrLaFeO4, and SrLaCoO4. Moreover, the amount of Olat(e)​ responsible for ethylene production was recorded to be the highest in the SrLaAlO4 catalyst, as 62.1 %. SrLaFeO4 and SrLaCoO4 had relative areas of Olat(e) of 54.4 % and 50.0 %, respectively. Meanwhile, the amount of Olat(n), which is responsible for producing a complete oxide, was the highest in SrLaFeO4, as 32.5 %. SrLaCoO4 and SrLaAlO4 had that as 30.4 % and 26.1 %, respectively. Also, all prepared catalysts had carbonate species on their surfaces. To double-check the presence of carbonate species, we additionally presented C 1s XPS spectra of SrLaXO4 catalysts. As shown in Fig. S3, we clearly confirmed that carbonate species are presented on the surface of SrLaXO4 catalysts. We compared the results of O 1s XPS to the catalytic activities of SrLaXO4 catalysts in OCM. As a result, among the prepared catalysts, the SrLaAlO4 catalyst had the largest amount of Olat(e), 62.1 %, which showed the highest ethylene selectivity as 33.6 %. SrLaFeO4, which showed the second-highest ethylene selectivity (14.8 %), had 54.4 % of Olat(e). In addition, the SrLaCoO4 catalyst, which had the lowest amount of Olat(e) (50.0 %), showed the lowest ethylene selectivity as 6.3 %. This tendency was consistent with previous studies, in which Olat(e) of catalyst selectively converts methane into ethylene. However, the proportional correlation between the Olat(n) and COx selectivity did not agree with previous studies that claim that Olat(n) of catalysts converts C2H6 into COx. Through OCM results (Fig. 3), the SrLaCoO4 catalyst showed the highest COx selectivity, but the amount of Olat(n) was not the highest among those of the prepared catalysts. Although SrLaFeO4 had the highest Olat(n), it showed lower COx selectivity than that of the SrLaCoO4 catalyst. In summary, we carried out Raman spectroscopy and XPS to confirm oxygen properties of SrLaXO4 catalysts, and we compared the obtained results to catalytic activities in OCM for confirmation of active factors. Through the comparison, it was confirmed that Ovac on surfaces of catalysts is responsible for the CH4 conversion, and Olat(e) of the catalysts has a role of selective production of ethylene. This correlation between the oxygen properties of the catalysts and the catalytic activities was substantially consistent with the literature. However, we could not explain that SrLaFeO4 and SrLaCoO4 catalysts showed different CH4 conversions, although Ovac was not observed in Raman spectra of both SrLaFeO4 and SrLaCoO4 catalysts. Moreover, the comparison did not agree with previous papers claiming that Olat(n) on surfaces of catalysts has a role of selective production of CO and CO2. Thus, we inferred that the mismatched correlations come from the difference in the temperature of conducting characterization tools and that during OCM. In other words, Raman spectroscopy and XPS were conducted at room temperature, whereas OCM was conducted at 775 ℃, and the difference of conducting temperature caused the mismatched correlation between oxygen properties and catalytic activities of the catalysts. Thus, we carried out additional characterization tools (TPD and FTIR) to check the validity of our inference. 3.3.3 Correction of oxygen properties of SrLaXO4 catalysts For confirmation of oxygen properties of the prepared SrLaXO4 catalysts at high temperature, TPD was employed. It is well known that TPD is a powerful and representative characterization tool of investigating oxygen properties of metal-oxide catalysts [34,50–52]. Therefore, we obtained TPD results on SrLaXO4 catalysts with the aim of checking oxygen properties of the catalysts that are crucial active factors of OCM. The obtained TPD results are illustrated in Fig. 5 . The results of TPD using the TCD detector are illustrated in Fig. 5(a); meanwhile, those of using the MS detector are illustrated in Fig. 5(b). In Fig. 5(a), all of the prepared catalysts showed peaks at 200–500 ℃ and above 750 ℃. Herein, we used the MS detector for confirmation of species of the desorbed molecules from the catalysts (Fig. 5(b)). Through the obtained TPD-MS results, we checked that the desorbed molecules are H2O, CO, and CO2. In detail, H2O and CO molecules desorbed from the catalysts at 200–500 ℃, whereas CO2 molecules desorbed from those above 750 ℃. In other words, SrLaXO4 catalysts showed consecutive desorption of H2O, CO, and CO2 molecules to correspond with increasing temperature. In OCM, the catalysts were pretreated at high temperature (775 ℃) for 20 min under an inert gas condition. Thus, we carried out TPD using the same pretreatment condition (Fig. S4). The obtained TPD results of SrLaXO4 catalysts pretreated using the same condition with pretreatment of OCM were different with those under He gas at 200 °C. Concretely, desorption peaks observed in Fig. 5(a) were not observed in Fig. S4. From the difference, it was confirmed that all H2O, CO, and CO2 molecules adsorbed on surfaces of catalysts are thoroughly desorbed from catalysts during the pretreatment process. Based on XPS results that showed that carbonates adsorbed on surfaces of catalysts, particularly, one could predict that the mismatched correlations between oxygen properties of the catalysts and catalytic activities in OCM are highly related to CO and CO2 desorption phenomena at increasing temperature. Thus, we employed FTIR to investigate carbonates on surfaces of SrLaXO4 catalysts. FTIR spectroscopy on the prepared SrLaXO4 catalysts was conducted to check that how H2O, CO, and CO2 molecules, which were observed from TPD and XPS results, combined with surfaces of the catalysts (Figs. 6 and S5). As illustrated in Figs. 6 and S5, the prepared catalysts showed peaks indicating functional groups such as OH− or CO3 2−. A peak of 3400 cm−1 indicating OH− was observed in FTIR spectra of all prepared SrLaXO4 catalysts, and it means that H2O molecules were physically adsorbed on surfaces of all prepared SrLaXO4 catalysts [53,54]. In addition, we could confirm that H2O desorption was observed from TPD-MS results at 200–500 ℃, owing to H2O molecules physically adsorbed on surfaces of catalysts. Moreover, the prepared catalysts showed peaks at 1384, 1457, and 1640 cm−1, indicating CO3 2−. Herein, FTIR peaks at 1384 and 1457 cm−1 indicate presence of monodentate carbonate; meanwhile, the FTIR peak at 1640 cm−1 indicates presence of bridged bidentate carbonate [55,56]. Concretely, monodentate carbonate is formed by a combination between O2− on surfaces of catalysts and CO2; meanwhile, bridged bidentate carbonate is formed by combination of O2−, Ovac of catalysts, and CO2 [57,58]. From the previously shown TPD results, we confirmed that H2O and COx molecules were desorbed from surfaces of catalysts during heat treatment at high temperature conditions. Thus, it was predicted that carbonate on surfaces of catalysts desorbed as CO or CO2 at high temperatures, and the desorbed sites could be exposed as oxygen species that were not detected by the characterization tool at room temperature. In accordance with various reports on catalysts for OCM, monodentate carbonate makes O2− species on surfaces of the catalysts after desorption of CO2 molecules at high temperatures, whereas bridged bidentate carbonate desorbed as a form of CO molecules from surfaces of the catalysts, and it makes not only O2− species but also Oads on surfaces of the catalysts. Herein, Oads species is formed by combination between an oxygen atom and an oxygen vacancy on catalysts (Scheme 1 ). To sum up, we confirmed that carbonates of SrLaXO4 catalysts observed by XPS analysis have two different formations of monodentate and bridged bidentate carbonate through FTIR spectroscopy. In increasing temperature conditions, the carbonates on surfaces of the catalysts desorbed as forms of CO or CO2. Concretely, monodentate carbonates desorbed as a form of CO2, whereas bridged bidentate carbonates desorbed as a form of CO because bridged bidentate carbonates generally formed on Ovac, which can strongly adsorb oxygen site of bridged bidentate carbonates. Because carbonates desorbed from the surface of the catalysts as increasing temperature, the desorption exposed oxygen species that were not exposed at room temperature. This means that oxygen species of the catalysts confirmed by XPS analysis should be changed at high temperatures. Thus, we attempted to correct the oxygen species of the catalysts at high temperatures based on results from the TPD, FTIR, and related reports (Scheme 1 and Table 2 ). In Scheme 1, it can be confirmed that Olat(n) appears on surfaces of catalysts when monodentate carbonates desorb from the catalysts as a form of CO2 molecules at high temperatures. In addition, it also can be confirmed that Olat(n) and Oads appear on surfaces of catalysts at high temperatures when bridged bidentate carbonates desorb from the catalysts as a form of CO molecules [58]. In other words, the amounts of Olat(n) and Oads on surfaces of catalysts can increase at high temperatures depending on the amounts of desorption of carbonates. Based on the aforementioned inferences, the obtained XPS results on the prepared catalysts should be corrected. In detail, carbonates on surfaces of the catalysts changed to Oads and Olat(n) at high temperature for OCM (775 ℃). Thus, we corrected the results of oxygen species of SrLaXO4 catalysts that were obtained by Raman and XPS, and the corrected results are presented in Table 2. Finally, we re-compared the obtained OCM results with those of the corrected oxygen species. In accordance with the corrected oxygen properties of SrLaXO4 catalysts, the SrLaCoO4 catalyst showed the largest amount of Olat(n) (40.8 %) among the prepared catalysts. The amount of Olat(n) of SrLaFeO4 was 36.1 %, and that of SrLaAlO4 was 27.6 %. Herein, it is well known that Olat(n) of catalysts is highly related to generation of CO x in OCM. In this study, thus, we could confirm that the order of CO x selectivity in OCM agrees well with that of the amount of Olat(n). Meanwhile, because the amount of Olat(e) of SrLaXO4 catalysts were not changed at high temperatures, the well-matched relationship between Olat(e) of the catalysts and C2 selectivity at low temperature was not influenced by increasing temperature. Moreover, we attempted to check whether Oads, which is known oxygen species, has a relation with CH4 conversion in OCM. In Scheme 1, it could be confirmed that not only Olat(n) but also Oads are exposed during desorption of CO at high temperatures. This means that the amount of Oads could increase with increasing temperature because of desorption of bridged bidentate carbonates from the catalysts. Therefore, a catalyst that has large amounts of CO desorption on its surface could show abundant Oads at high temperature. We directly confirmed their amount of CO desorption, and we showed the amounts using Table S4. Although Ovac was not observed in Raman spectra of both SrLaFeO4 and SrLaCoO4 catalysts, the catalysts could show that different amounts of Oads led to different amounts of CO desorption as temperature increased. Consequently, the difference of amounts of CO desorption could lead to a difference in CH4 conversion. Thus, the SrLaAlO4 catalyst that showed Ovac even at room temperature showed the highest CH4 conversion due to its abundant sites for adsorption of oxygen, and the SrLaFeO4 catalyst showed higher CH4 conversion than the SrLaCoO4 catalyst from the difference of amounts of CO desorption. Based on these results, we proposed a mechanism of OCM through Scheme 2 . Consequently, we corrected oxygen properties of SrLaXO4 catalysts and compared the corrected results to catalytic activities in OCM. As temperature increases, the carbonates adsorbed on surface of catalysts are gradually desorbed, and the desorption leads to increases of Olat(n) and Oads of the catalysts. Thus, we considered the amounts of Olat(n) and Oads of the catalysts that could not be perfectly observed at room temperature using TPD analysis. Finally, it was confirmed that the corrected oxygen properties of the catalysts were well matched with their catalytic activities in OCM. Based on these results, we corrected oxygen properties of SrLaXO4 catalysts and compared the corrected results to catalytic activities in OCM. Finally, we attempted to correlate between oxygen properties of SrLaXO4 catalysts and their catalytic activities in OCM, and thus, proposed a reaction pathway of OCM in Scheme 2. Consequently, as temperature increases, the carbonates adsorbed on surface of catalysts are gradually desorbed, and the desorption leads to increases of Olat(n) and Oads of the catalysts. Thus, we considered the amounts of Olat(n) and Oads of the catalysts that could not be perfectly observed at room temperature using TPD analysis. Finally, it was confirmed that the corrected oxygen properties of the catalysts were closely related to their catalytic activities in OCM. 4 Conclusions In this study, we synthesized SrLaXO4 catalysts (X = Al, Fe, or Co) and applied the catalysts to OCM to confirm active factors of catalysts for OCM. In the results of OCM under the prepared catalysts, the SrLaAlO4 catalyst exhibited the highest methane conversion and ethylene selectivity. Contrarily, the SrLaCoO4 catalyst performed the lowest methane conversion and the highest complete oxide (carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide; COx) selectivity among the prepared catalysts. For the confirmation of active factors, in addition, we employed various characterizations at high temperature conditions and at room temperature. Through the results of the employed characterization tools, stability of the prepared catalysts in OCM was first confirmed, and amounts of oxygen species including adsorbed oxygen (Oads), nucleophilic lattice oxygen species (Olat(n)), and electrophilic lattice oxygen species (Olat(e)) at high temperature conditions were clearly quantified. Herein, we thoroughly confirmed that oxygen properties play a crucial role as active factors of the catalysts in OCM. In detail, amounts of Oads of the prepared catalysts showed a proportional trend with methane conversion results in OCM. Furthermore, amounts of Olat(n) on SrLaXO4 catalysts influenced selectivity for complete oxides, whereas amounts of Olat(e) on the catalysts affected selectivity for ethylene. Consequently, we clearly confirmed that roles of oxygen species as active factors of the applied catalysts in OCM. Through the confirmation, we finally concluded that catalysts with large amounts of Oads and Olat(e) are required to achieve high performances in OCM.

        "dc:description": "We attempted to thoroughly investigate active sites of catalysts for oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) using SrLaXO4 (X = Al, Fe, or Co) catalysts with not only clear structures but also considerable catalytic activities. In this regard, various characterization tools at high-temperature conditions and at room temperature were employed. The results of characterizations clearly confirmed that oxygen properties of catalysts for OCM are considerably related to their catalytic activities in OCM. Concretely, adsorbed oxygen species (Oads) on the catalysts play the role of converting methane into methyl radicals. Herein, the methyl radicals are consecutively converted into ethane in the atmosphere, and the generated ethane molecules are additionally converted depending on lattice oxygen species of applied catalysts, which can be divided into nucleophilic lattice oxygen species (Olat(n)) and electrophilic lattice oxygen species (Olat(e)). Olat(n) is a favorable oxygen species for producing carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide from ethane, whereas Olat(e) functions as an oxygen species in the conversion ethane into ethylene. Consequently, we concluded that preparation of catalysts with abundant amounts of Oads and Olat(e) is a key strategy for achieving high performances in OCM.",
