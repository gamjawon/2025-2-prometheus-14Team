Although great accomplishments of functional material synthesis have been achieved in sodium ion batteries (SIBs) recently, there are still numerous challenges and problems in preparing carbon-based materials with porous architectures and enough lattice distance for Na+ insertion. Herein we report a templated strategy to synthesize 3D porous graphene girds (PGGs) consisting of several stacking graphene structure with ultrahigh surface area and hierarchical connected structure by employing Ag nanoparticles (NPs). The Ag NPs will regenerate for decreasing the experimental cost, also in line with principles of green chemistry and environmentally friendly strategy. The PGGs obtain advanced specific capacity of 160 mA h g−1 at current density of 50 mA h g−1. Moreover, 112 mA h g−1 capacity can be gained at 1 A h g−1 during 1000 cycles. Due to their porous architecture, ultrahigh surface area and low amorphous graphited structure, PGGs electrode showed the excellent electrochemical performance in high rate capability. Graphical abstract The porous graphene grids synthesized using Ag NPs as template and their enhanced electrochemical performances for SIBs. Image, graphical abstract Keywords Carbon-based materials Porous structure Ultrahigh surface area Ag nanoparticle Sodium ion battery 1 Introduction Researchers have made abundant efforts on developing the clean and renewable energy sources especially in recyclable batteries all around world [1–4]. As important secondary batteries and potential alternatives for energy storage, rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are investigated broadly, because resources of Na are low-cost and more plentiful than Li [5–11]. Recently, people have focused on exploiting novel electrode materials with porous structures and large clearances [11–17]. Metal oxides [10,18] and sulfides [19,20], carbon-based materials [21,22] and alloy-based materials [23,24] are widely chosen as potential anode materials for SIBs. A part of metallic alloy would make a large volume expansion, like Sb (390%) and Sn (520%), hindering intercalative reaction of Na [25,26]. A number of anodes those consist of metal oxides can exhibit high energy densities and capacities because of their multi-electron reactions, however, poor cycle performances and low initial coulombic efficiency also limit future application of SIBs. Hence, carbon-based materials are considered as the most promising anode electrode owing to their renewable properties and absolute ample reserves. Nevertheless, although chemical properties and storage mechanism in electrode materials of Na are expected to be similar with Li, some excellent materials applied in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), like graphite, is not a favorable anode material for Na ion battery usually, because the radius of Na+ is larger than Li+ (1.02 vs 0.76 Å). In addition Na/graphite cells deliver a low capacity of ∼35 mA h g−1 by forming NaC64, indicating that sodiation of graphite might be not a thermodynamically beneficial process [27–29]. Graphene, as a well-known novel and excellent 2D carbon-based material, recently draws public attention in the field of material due to its unique structure, enough interlayer distance and special property [30,31]. Wan designed and synthesized a new sandwich-like G@HPC nanocomposite by ionothermal process, showing a high specific capacity of 400 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 and good long cycle stability at a high current density relatively [20,32]. Dahn and co-workers found that hard-carbon materials could show a reversible capacity around 300 mA h g−1, and demonstrated that Na+ could insert into the random stacking layers of porous hard carbon [33]. These remarkable electrochemical performances can be attributed to hierarchical porous structure and enough interlayer distance for Na+ insertion. It must be also noted that a portion of the capacity for hard carbon comes from low-potential (ca. 0 V), close to the sodium plating potential, which might make potential safety hazard around the fast charging process. Porous carbon materials can also be synthesized by heating mesoporous carbons at high temperature (>2500 °C), this strategy still cause many problems such as high energy consumption and recycling of raw materials [34]. Furthermore, interconnected porous architecture with high surface area is conductive to Na flowing and inserting [20]. Most reported carbon-based materials might not possess these properties to be appropriate candidate for SIBs [9]. So it is essential and crucial to develop novel type carbon-based materials with large porous structure and suitable interlayer distance for Na+ insertion [35–40]. Now, we report a strategy to synthesize 3D porous graphene grids (PGGs) consisting of under-five stacking graphene with high surface area employing Ag nanoparticles (NPs) as template. The conformed structure of Ag NPs is suitable template for preparing a hierarchical interconnected porous structure and distinct reticulate carbon girds [41–45]. In the meanwhile, Ag NPs can be recycled by nitric acid dissolving, which decreases the experimental cost and make the process more environmental friendly. 2 Experimental AgNO3 (99.8%, AR), oleylamine (OAm, 80%–90%, Aladdin) and other reagents are used without further purification. 2.1 Synthesis of 7.5 nm Ag nanoparticles AgNO3 (0.34 g, 2.0 mmol) and OAm (20 mL, 58 mmol) were mixed and stirred in a three-necked flask. The mixture was heated at 110 °C with vigorous stirring for 40 min, obtaining a golden-yellow homogeneous solution, and this mixture was flash-heated to 180 °C. Maintaining for 3 h, the color of solution converted to light-brown. After cooling down to room temperature, as-prepared Ag NPs were separated by ethanol (40 mL). After the suspension was centrifuged and washed with ethanol for three times, the final product Ag NPs were dispersed in hexane (10 mL). 2.2 Synthesis of carbon-based materials 10 mL solution was placed in a rectangular porcelain combustion boat with sealed relatively, so that the Ag NPs would achieve self-assembly in order to make the ordered structure more compacted after hexane vaporized slowly extremely. The carbonized Ag NPs were synthesized by heat treatment at 500 °C for 2 h in Ar. To harvest the porous carbon grids (PCGs) materials, nitric acid was employed to remove Ag NPs for several times adding with strongly stirring in 70 °C. The suspension was centrifuged and washed with distilled water until pH came to 7, the PCGs would be prepared through freeze drying and the solution could be concentrated and crystalize AgNO3 for using recycle. Finally, PCGs were heating at 800 °C for 4 h to obtain 3D PGGs. 2.3 Structural characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Rigaku D/max-2500 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation for characterizing the architecture of the synthesized NPs. The detailed morphologies and structures of materials were studied by scanning electron microscope (SEM) JEOL JSM-6700F Field Emission, operating at 5 kV) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, Philips Tecnai G2 F20) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX) for elemental analysis. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI 5000 Versaprobe, ULVAC PHI) was employed to investigate the valence of elements. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum was record for the KBr dilute sample using a FTIR-650 spectrometer (Tianjin Gangdong, resolution of 4 cm−1). The specific surface areas of the resultant products were investigated through nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements by using a NOVA 2200e analyzer. The thermal stable performances of the PCGs and PGGs were recorded by Thermo Gravimetric Analyzer Derivative Thermogravimetry Analyzer (TG-DTA, SETARAM S60). Raman spectrum was studied by employing a confocal Raman microscope (DXR, Thermo-Fisher Scientific). 2.4 Electrochemical measurement For preparing working electrodes, the PGGs power, acetylene black and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder at a weight ratio of 70:20:10 were dispersed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) solvent and ground absolutely into a slurry. Then, this slurry was pasted on a pure Cu foil which was punched into wafers with 1 cm in diameter (around 0.785 cm2) only one side and dried at 80 °C for 12 h. Then, the electrochemical performances were measured employing two electrode coin-type cell (CR2032) and assembled in an argon-filled glove box. The pure Na foil was used as counter electrode and the Glass Fiber as separator. The electrolyte was mixed liquid consisted of 1 M NaPF6 and 0.28 M fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) in propylene carbonate (PC) solution. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were achieved with a CHI660E electrochemical work station. The galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling measurements were run at different current densities between key off voltages of 0.01–3.0 V (vs. Na+/Na) on a CT2001A cell test instrument (LAND Electronic Co.) at room temperature. 3 Results and discussion The illustration shows the synthetic process of PGGs from Ag NPs in Scheme 1 . By heating AgNO3-oleylamine (OAm) complex solution for 3 h at 180 °C, the colloidal Ag NPs capped with OAm were prepared at first [41–44]. After drying in the air slowly, self-assembly Ag-OAm NPs were calcinated for 2 h to gain Ag–C NPs in the Ar. The carbon-based materials, PCGs were obtained from solving Ag–C NPs by nitric acid more than three times, to ensure Ag NPs removed completely, meanwhile, AgNO3 can be regenerated by crystalized from concentrated solution. Finally, PCGs were heated at 800 °C for 4 h producing 3D PGGs. Fig. 1 shows the morphologies and structural features of Ag NPs prepared at different reaction time. The Ag NPs, whose particle size distributions is 7.5 nm, are more average and integrated than that of those synthesized at high temperature, which is attributable to Ostwald ripening process [42,45]. These Ag NPs, which are explicit dodecahedral structures, evidenced in indifferent orientation by high-resolution TEM (HRTEM, Fig. 1(g–i)), convert to superlattices by self-assemble drying of solution in hexane slowly [46–49]. The neat Ag NPs superlattices can fabricate ordered void and form interconnected porous architecture. It also illustrates that they are appropriate materials as carbonized templates in Fig. 2 . For carbonizing the surface-coating OAm protective agent, the self-assembly Ag-OAm NPs were subordinate to calcine treatment in Ar for 2 h at 500 °C, in order to certain that OAm is carbonized completely without destroying the well-organized structure of superlattices. The ratio of Ag and carbon is 4:1, corroborated by Inductive Coupled Plasma Emission Spectrometer (ICP) measurement, which evidences the generation and productivity of carbon. For harvesting the PCGs material, nitric acid was employed to remove the Ag NPs by acid etching in Fig. 3 (a) and Supplementary Fig. S1. The suspension is centrifuged and washed by distilled water more than three times. The PCGs would be gained through freeze drying without disrupting special porous structure, in the meantime, argent flake-like AgNO3 could be crystalized from concentrated solution slowly by heating at 70 °C, shown in Fig. S2. As a significant and expensive resource, the regenerative AgNO3 precursor can be utilized to synthesize Ag NPs recycling, according to green chemistry principle especially. TEM images show the order porous structures of PCGs in Fig. 3(a–c). The PCGs are net structures with 5 nm pore walls composed of 1.5 nm carbon filaments from OAm carbonization. Additionally, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX) confirms that PCGs are only consisting of carbon element (Cu framework of TEM) in Fig. S3. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) proves that PCGs are amorphous carbon in Fig. 3(c), with same results in X-ray diffraction (XRD) in Fig. 4 (a). In order to increase structural stability of carbon material, the PCGs are subject to heat treatment in Ar for 4 h at 800 °C, obtaining 3D PGGs carbon materials. In Fig. 3(d–f), the morphology of PGGs is porous stereoscopic structure like beehive, composed of monolayer hollow net-shape graphene chaining with 4 nm pore width. It shows that PGGs are consist of under-five stacking graphene layers on the edge with an interlayer spacing of about 0.397 nm, and proves more distinct graphitization and crystallization than PCGs in Fig. 3(f) [12]. What is more, the PGGs are also amorphous carbon shown in FFT images and XRD curve in Fig. 4(a), these special properties can be favorable for inserting Na+ in active sites extremely. For the sake of investigating the generation and comparison of PGGs and PCGs further, more characteristic measurements were employed in detail. The XRD patterns indicate the phase transformation of precursors and carbon materials explicitly. After heating treatments, broad peaks of carbon appear with Ag characteristic peaks increasing, against Ag NPs. But nitric acid was brought in the system for etching subsequently, Ag converts into ionic condition Ag+ and Ag peaks disappear completely with PCGs only remain in the system. The peak intensity of PGGs is much stronger than that of PCGs, indicating that crystallization and stability are improved on the basis of calcination treatments certainly. The thermos-stability is further characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in air, and results show that the carbon burning temperature of PCGs is lower than PGGs (560 vs 620 °C) in Fig. 4(b). And the combustion curve of PGGs is much more gently than PCGs, even just after 500 °C. The PGGs would not tend to be oxidized easily in air, because of the improved graphitization and chemical stability. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum is used to characterize the structures of PCGs and PGGs carbon materials in Fig. 4(c). The spectra of PGGs are similar with PCGs, by virtue of characteristic peaks at 1737.1 cm−1, 1391.7 cm−1 and 1090.4 cm−1. The relatively strong band (at 1737.1 cm−1) is most often related to the CO stretching of COOH groups and the peak at 1391.7 cm−1 is attributed to the bending of COH. Another characteristic peak at 1090.4 cm−1 is the skeletal modes of stretching combinations of CO and CC [50–52]. It indicates that fundamental structures are consistent properly of carbon materials and PGGs originate from PCGs on the basic of identical molecule structures [9,21]. Furthermore, the variation of graphitization degree causes the difference of PCGs and PGGs as shown in Raman spectrum in Fig. 4(d). The D and G bands at 1329 cm−1 and 1587 cm−1 of PGGs, respectively, imply the defect and vibration of carbon materials interior structure. The intensity ratio of the D and G bands (I D/I G) is equivalent to 1.05, higher than PCGs (0.86), it suggests that disorder degree of the structure of PGGs increasing obviously, higher than that of PCGs, corresponding to HRTEM observations [12,52]. As an important index to evaluate the performance of carbon materials, Fig. 4(e) exhibits typical N2 adsorption/desorption curves of the PGGs, which indicates obvious characterization of type Ⅳ isotherms. The large H2-type hysteresis loop at P/P 0 of about 0.45 shows the PGGs are porous caged structures and pore width distribution of the PGGs in Fig. 4(f), are about 3.8 nm in dimension, these results mean that the PGGs are composed of 3D girds structure connected each other by porous ultrathin carbon frameworks. The characteristic Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of the PGGs calculated is about 1598 m2 g−1 with a pore volume of 1.83 cm3 g−1. Prominently, the BET surface area of the PGGs is much higher than that of many reported porous carbon materials, this specific ultrahigh surface area can provide abundant active sites for Na+ adsorbing and porous structure would supply Na+ with more favorable transport route [7,9,34]. The electrochemical performances of the carbon-based materials as an anode of the SIB were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in Fig. 5 (a). CV curves of the PGGs electrode at scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 show two main reduction peaks at 0.01 and 1.0 V and two weak reduction peaks at 0.25 and 0.6 V. However, two weak reduction peaks disappear after first cycle, and only 0.01 V remained at 3rd cycle, implies the decomposition of the electrolyte and the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in the first cycle. It shows the discharge–charge curves of the PGGs electrode after the first cycle at a current density of 50 mA g−1 in Fig. 5(b). The classical voltage profiles of hard carbon electrode materials are two regions that one region is a sloping voltage and other is a low-potential plateau chose to 0 V, whereas, there is much different from that of the PGGs with only a sloping voltage region. The Na might deposit on the surface of hard carbon materials, which most capacity reflected in low potential plateau, it will cause the safety problems. The PGGs electrode materials can decrease this issue because of the absence of potential plateau close to 0 V. The outstanding electrochemical performances are also embodied in rate capability of the PGGs with the galvanostatic curves of at different rates in Fig. 5(c). The PGGs electrode can supply 210.2, 160.2 and 112.2 mA h g−1 as discharge capacities at current densities of 28, 57 and 140 mA h g−1, respectively, still delivers reversible capacities of 160.3, 134.4 and 109.1 mA h g−1 respectively in Fig. 5(d). Moreover, the PGGs anode materials also show ultrahigh cycling performance particularly. High capacities of 160 and 145 mA h g−1 are gained at current density of 50 mA g−1 after 225 cycles and 100 mA h g−1 after 450 cycles respectively, shown in Figs. S4 and 5(e). After persistent cycling for 1000 cycles at a high current density of 1000 mA h g−1, the PGGs could even still maintain a specific capacity of 112 mA h g−1, which the coulombic efficiency is approaching 100% without obvious performance deterioration shown in Fig. 5(f). The PGGs electrode for SIBs displays excellent performances than some reported previously carbonaceous materials including the PCGs material (Table S1). The PCGs anode sustain a relative stable electrochemical performance about 110 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles at current density of 50 mA g−1, but it decays fast specially after 200 cycles staying at tiny capacity in Fig. S5. The Nyquist plots of the PCGs and PGGs with corresponding equivalent circuit are shown in Fig. 6 . From results of the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), it could be clearly seen that the plots consist of a semicircle at the high frequency region and an approximately 45° inclined line at the low frequency region, the plots also reflect that the internal resistance of PGGs is much lower than PCGs. Such remarkable electrochemical performances of PGGs anode are attributed to three reasons: at first, the enough interlayer distances will permit Na+ inserting freely. Secondly, porous girds structure with ultrahigh surface area can provide adequate interspace and reaction active sites for the insertion and storage of Na+. In the last, low graphitization and amorphous random stack structure of PGGs are conductive to recycle of the Na+insertion in and out [53–55]. Results also suggest that the graphited and grids structure still maintained well, showing the special porous structure keeps integrity and stability of the PGGs after 1000 cycles, which sustains prominent recycled electrochemical durability for SIBs in Fig. S6. 4 Conclusions In summary, we have established a synthesized strategy of preparing 3D PGGs consisting of several stacking graphene with ultrahigh surface area. The PGGs carbon-based material which prepared by employing Ag NPs as template, shows a distinct hierarchical connected porous structure. Based on the principle of green chemistry environmentally friendly methods, Ag can be recycled through acid solving. The PGGs exhibit excellent electrochemical performances as anode for SIBs in terms of high rate capability and long cycle life, high specific capacity of 160 and 112 mA h g−1 are gained at current density of 50 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles and 1 A h g−1 after 1000 cycles respectively, because of porous girds structure with ultrahigh surface area and low graphited amorphous random stack architectures of PGGs. This novel concept for preparing carbon materials would expand chemical synthesized strategy and the PGGs can also find various applications in other fields such as chemical absorption, energy storage devices and catalysis.
