The catalytic activity was evaluated by two model reactions, namely thiophene hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and pyridine hydrogenation (HDN), in the temperature range 573-623 K using a flow system operated at 2 MPa (HDS) or 3 MPa (HDN) total pressure. DRS results of the oxidic precursors suggested that the effect of fluoride incorporation to the alumina support is that it increases slightly the octahedrally coordinated fractions of Ni and W. The XPS results of the sulfided catalysts showed that the dispersion of the Ni and W phases decreased progressively with increasing fluoride content. This technique also showed that these phases were only partially sulfided under the present experimental sulfiding conditions, and that the extent of sulfidation of such phases apparently tends to decrease slightly with increasing fluoride content, in contrast with the results suggested by the IR-NO spectra. The sulfur content of sulfided samples, as measured by chemical analysis, revelated that the sulfidation degree increased only slightly with increasing fluoride content. The activity for thiophene HDS was almost invariant with fluoride addition, but the subsequent hydrogenation of the intermediate products (butenes) was found to decrease linearly with the fluoride content. Possible interpretations for these changes in activity and selectivity, which reflect changes in the relative distribution of the different active sites for the two reactions, are discussed in relation with the structural variations of the active phases described above.

Introduction The catalysts currently used in hydrotreating processes involve transition metal sulfides from the Group VI (Mo, W) promoted by sulfides of the Group VIII (Co, Ni) and generally supported on alumina. Additives such as fluoride or phosphoric are often also incorporated into the actual hydrotreating catalysts. The addition of small amounts of fluoride to alumina or another oxide support to increase its acidity and, therefore, its activity for acid catalyzed reactions, is a common practice in catalysis, which has been used for many years in the preparation of acid and bifunctional catalysts based on metals, mainly for reforming catalysts [1,2]. This addition of fluoride has lately been used in hydrotreating catalysts with the aim of increasing its acidity [3-6], and conse- quently to favor the hydrocracking, hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and hydrodeni- trogenation (HDN) reactions [6-8]. Most studies on this field refer exclusively to unpromoted Mo catalysts [9-11 ] or promoted by Co [ 12-14] or Ni [ l 3,15,16], generally supported over alumina and exceptionally over other supports [17,18]. However, concerning fluoride-containing W catalysts the literature is very limited, although W-based catalysts are more used in hydrotreating processes, especially when increased hydrogenation activity is required, like for HDN and dearomatization reactions. In an earlier work Mulcahy et al. [19,20] examined the effect of fluoride-modified alumina on molybdate and tungstate, and later on the same authors [21 ] studied the effect of fluoride on the dispersion of Mo and W phases of Mo/A1203 and W/A1203 samples. In a previous study [22] we found that the addition of fluoride to alumina favored the formation of poly- tungstates in W/A1203 catalysts. More recently [23,24] for the same catalysts, it was also shown that these changes induced by fluoridation in the surface distribution of the oxidic W species led to improvements in their sulfidation, to significant changes in the morphology of the WS: structures, and to increased activity for both gas oil HDS and pyridine HDN when fluoride content was increased. Moreover, it was found that the promotion induced by fluoride was relatively higher for HDN than for HDS [23,24]. For NiW/A1203 catalysts, Moon and Song [25] reported that fluoride addition enhanced the rates for HDS of thiophene and n-heptane hydroprocess- ing. In this case, the authors suggested, however, that fluoride increased not only the acidic strength but also the metal dispersion of the NiW/A1203 catalyst. These results on metal dispersion for the NiW/A1203 catalysts contrast with those referred above for unpromoted W/AI203 catalysts. In the present work we have investigated the changes induced by alumina A. Benltez et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996)343-364 345 fluoridation on the structure of NiW/AI203 catalysts and their catalytic proper- ties for thiophene HDS and pyridine HDN. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), surface area, surface acidity measurements, UV-VIS diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed NO and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation A \"y-Al203 commercial support (Girdler T-126, SBEw = 188 m2 g-~, pore volume = 0.39 cm3 g-1) was crushed and sieved to obtain a particle size range of 0.59-0.84 mm. This support was previously dried at 373 K for 2 h and then impregnated by the pore volume method with aqueous solutions of NH 4F of the appropriate concentration to yield samples containing 0.0, 0.2, 0.8, 1.5 and 2.5 wt.-% fluoride. The wet impregnated alumina was left to rest overnight. Thereafter, it was dried at 383 K for 2 h, followed by calcination in air flow at 653 K for 2 h and then at 823 K for 4.5 h. These fluorinated alumina samples were used to prepare a series of supported NiW catalysts. The catalysts were prepared by simultaneous impregnation with aqueous solutions of (NH4)~,H2Wj204 and Ni(NO3)2 6H20 according to the wetness impregnation method. The concentrations of salts were selected in order to achieve metal loadings of 20.9 wt.-% WO3 and 3.17 wt.-% NiO, by impregnating (pore volume method) such supports simultaneously with aqueous solutions of (NH 4)6H 2W12040 and Ni(NO3)2 6H 2O. The impregnated samples were dried and calcined following the same procedure and conditions described above for the fluorided-alumina samples. The catalysts are denoted as NiW/A1-F(x), where x is the fluoride weight percentage. As reference for catalyst characteri- zation, monometallic W/A1-F(0.8) and Ni/A1-F(0.8) samples were also pre- pared following the procedure described above: their W and Ni loading were as for the binary NiW catalysts. 2.2. Catalyst characterization The X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained with a Philips PW 1716/30 difractometer using Ni-filtered CuK~ radiation. Specific surface areas of cal- cined catalysts were measured by N2 adsorption using a semiautomatic BET apparatus. DRS spectra of the oxidic catalysts were obtained in a Perkin Elmer Lambda 9 spectrophotometer using ~/-A1203 as reference. Total surface acidity of sulfided catalysts was determined potentiometrically by titration with n- butylamine in acetonitrile following the method previously described [26]. 346 A. BeMtez et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 343-364 Infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet ZDX FT-IR spectrophotometer at a resolution of 2 cm-1. For these measurements the oxidic precursor samples were pressed into very thin self-supporting wafers (thickness, 10.0-11.6 mg cm-2) and sulfided in situ with a 10% (v/v) H2S/H2 mixture for 4 h at 673 K. After purging the cell with nitrogen, the samples were heated at 773 K and outgassed for 1 h, then cooled to room temperature. They were subsequently exposed to 4.0 KPa of NO for 1 min and then the spectra were recorded. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were obtained in a Fisons ESCALAB MK II 200R spectrometer with an hemispherical electron analyzer and Mg K o~ = 1253.6 eV radiation. The powdered samples were sulfided separately in a 10% (v/v) H2S-H2 mixture at 673 K for 4 h and then collected under iso-octane and pressed into small holders under the meniscus of iso-octane to prevent oxidation by air. Each spectral region was signal averaged for a number of scans to obtain good signal-to-noise ratios. Although surface charging was observed in all samples, accurate binding energies (BE) could be determined by charge referencing with the adventitious A1 2p line at 74.7 eV. The sulfur analysis in sulfided catalysts was carried out by converting the sulfides into sulfates by fusion with NaOH at 723 K and the resulting melt was dissolved in water to determine the sulfate content [27]. The amount of sulfate was determined by titration with an excess of barium perchlorate and analysing the excess of barium by atomic absorption spectrometry. Prior to sulfur analysis, all catalysts were simultaneously sulfided under conditions comparable to those used for the XPS samples: heated in a 10% H2S in H2 flow (73 cm3 min- i) at 673 K for 4 h, and then cooled down to room temperature in a He flow. 2.3. Catalytic activity Independent measurements of catalytic activity for thiophene HDS and pyridine HDN were carried out in a conventional flow microreactor operating at 573, 598 and 623 K and medium high pressure (2-3 MPa). Prior to the activity test, the catalyst samples were sulfided in situ at 673 K for 4 h using a 10 tool-% H2S/H2 mixture. The experiments for thiophene HDS were carried out at 2 MPa total pressure. Catalyst samples of 0.1 g were diluted with an equal volume of carborundum. A mixture of 15 vol.-% of thiophene in cyclohexane was fed to the reactor by a mini pump, together with a flow of H2 at a molar ratio of H2 to thiophene of 9:1. Unreacted thiophene, cyclohexane and reaction products (consisting exclu- sively of n-butenes and n-butane) were analyzed by gas chromatography using an n-octane on Porasil C column held at 363 K. The experiments for pyridine HDN were carried out at a 3 MPa total pressure. Catalysts samples of 0.5 g were diluted with an equal volume of carborundum. A mixture of 5 wt.-% pyridine and 0.5 wt.-% CS2 in cyclohexane was fed to the reactor by a mini pump, together with a flow of H2 at a molar A. Ben#ez et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 343-364 347 ratio of H2 to pyridine of 36:1. The reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography using a methylsilicone capillary column held at 333 K. The experiments were performed at low conversions, generally below 15%. The reaction rate constants (kHDs, kHDN) were calculated assuming in both cases pseudo first order reactions. The hydrogenation rate constant (kHvD) in the HDS reaction was calculated using the Okamoto equation [28]. 3. Results 3.1. X-ray diffraction The XRD patterns of the oxidic catalysts showed only the diffraction lines characteristic of \",/-A1203. Other crystalline structures at the XRD scale (i.e., ca. 4 nm crystal size), of compounds such as AIF3, WO3, NiO or any other defined compounds from binary combinations of the phases present, were not detected. 3.2. Surface area The BET surface areas of the catalysts are shown in Table 1. A slight decrease in the specific surface area was observed with increasing fluoride content. This effect was similar to that observed for fluorinated-alumina sup- ported W [22] and Mo [9,12,13,15-17] catalysts. The nitrogen adsorption-de- sorption isotherms of the NiW/A1-F(0) and NiW/A1-F(0.2) catalysts showed that small additions of fluoride did not greatly affect the total pore volume (0.30 cm3 g- 1 for 0.0 wt.-% F and 0.29 cm3 g- 1 for 0.2 wt.-% F) and the mean pore radius (8.0 nm for 0.0 wt.-% F and 8.4 nm for 0.2 wt.-% F-). However. the micropore volume was slightly decreased with fluoride addition.

Benftez et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 343-364 3.3. UV-VIS diffuse reflectance The DRS spectra of the calcined NiW/A1-F(x) catalysts showed bands in three different regions of the spectrum. In the region 200-380 nm all catalysts exhibited only a broad band with maximum at about 255 nm, which is very close to the single band due to W6+ in tetrahedral coordination [22]. As observed previously for W/A1-F(x) catalysts [22], the position of this band was shifted slightly towards higher wavelengths and its intensity increased slightly when the fluoride content was increased from 0.0 to 0.2 wt.-% F- and then remained almost constant with further fluoride addition. In the spectral region 380-450 nm (Fig. 1) appeared one band with a maximum at 400-425 nm which has been generally assigned to Ni octahedrally coordinated, Ni(0), species [29]. As the fluoride content in the catalyst was increased from 0.0 to 2.5 wt.-%, the position of the maximum of this band shifted from 400 to 425 nm, respectively, suggesting interaction of the Ni(0) species probably with W in form of NiWO4. Also, the intensity of this band increased with fluoride content. Finally, in the region 550-750 nm (see inset in Fig. 1) appeared a wide band which increased slightly with increasing fluoride content and which includes contributions from Ni tetrahedrally, Ni(T), and octahedrally, Ni(0), coordinated [29]. The semiquan- titative results for the Ni(0)/Ni(T) ratio, estimated from the ratio of the Schuster-Kubelka-Munk remission function at 415 nm and 630 nm, are shown in Table 1. It can be observed from this table that the ratio of Ni(0)/Ni(T) increases slightly with increasing fluoride content in the alumina support. 3.4.

FT-IR of adsorbed NO In general, the infrared spectra of NO adsorbed on sulfided NiW/A1-F(x) catalysts showed bands with very low intensity in the 1680-1800 cm i region and intense, but broad, ones in the 1800-1900 cm i region. Thus, in order to amplify the scale of the weak absorption region and to analyze its features better, we have presented these two regions of the spectra separately and compared its features with the reference spectra of two monometallic W/AI- F(0.8) and Ni/A1-F(0.8) samples. In the 1680-1810 cm-1 region (Fig. 2a) all the NiW/A1-F(x) catalysts show an asymmetric and wide band, with a maximum which moves from about 1761 350 A. Ben#ez et aL / Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 343-364 to 1780 cm-~ with increasing fluoride concentrations. This band is accompanied by a very weak one at lower frequency, which becomes better defined in the catalysts with high fluoride content and presents the maximum at about 1704 cm-j. As Fig. 2b shows, these bands appear well defined in the reference spectrum of the sulfided W/A1-F(0.8) catalyst, although they are less intense (the ordinate scale in the Fig. 2b is 15 times smaller than that in Fig. 2a) and their maxima are shifted about 10 cm-~ towards higher frequencies. The position of the intense high frequency band of the NiW/A1-F(x) catalysts also moves (15-25 cm-~) to lower frequencies as compared to that found at 1795 cm-~ by Kazusaka and Howe [30] for NO adsorbed on activated W(CO)6-A1203 catalysts. This band at 1795 cm-~ was assigned to W4+(NO)2 species. By similarity with the shifts observed for reduced and sulfided NiMo/AI203 catalysts [31,32], the band at 1761-1780 cm-j in Fig. 2a can then be assigned to the high frequency band of the stretching mode of vibration of NO adsorbed on W4+ ions surrounded probably by sulfur. A similar band at 1780 cm-~ has also been assigned to W4+ in sulfur environment by Atanasova et al. [33] for sulfided W/, NiW/and NiW-P/AI203 catalysts. However, since the position of the band at 1780 cm-~ is practically equal to the high frequency band due to the symmetric stretching mode of NO in a W4+(NO)2 complex reported by Yan et al. [34] for reduced W/AI203 catalysts, a precise assignment of this band in relation to a particular oxygen/sulfur surrounding of W4+ ions is not possible for the present catalysts, and the uncertainty on the assignment of the observed band at 1761-1780 cm-1 regarding the environment of the W4+ species still remains. The apparent shift of the maximum and the broadening of this band could result from heterogeneity in the coordination of the sulfided and/or oxided W4+ species, or due to interaction of the W4+ ions with the Ni species as the shift in the DRS band at 400 nm also suggested. Fig. 3a shows the zone 1810-1900 cm-1 of the spectra corresponding to the NiW/A1-F(x) catalysts. In this spectral region the catalysts exhibited a major band at about 1847 cm-~, and a minor band or shoulder at about 1887 cm-~ which progressively disappeared as the fluoride content in the catalyst was raised. The features of these bands were very similar to those exhibited by the reference spectrum of the sulfided Ni/A1-F(0.8) sample (Fig. 3b), which showed a single broad band at about 1834 cm-~, characteristic of NO adsorbed on sulfided Ni2+ species on alumina [31-33,35], and a shoulder at about 1865 cm-1 which is close to the 1886 cm-~ band generally assigned to NO adsorbed on Ni2+ ions in an oxidic surrounding [31,36]. The presence of this shoulder indicates, therefore, an incomplete sulfidation of the Ni/A1-F(0.8) sample under the conditions used. Therefore, according to these results and those in the literature [31-33,35,36], in the present sulfided NiW/A1-F(x) catalysts most of the Ni is in the sulfided state and only a small part remains oxidized or partially sulfided. The shift of about 12 cm-1 towards higher wavelengths of the band due to the Ni(NO) complex exhibited by the NiW/A1-F(x) catalysts, as A.

Similar shifts were observed in the past for NiMo [35,36] and CoMo [31] catalysts. The features of the IR-NO spectra, and particularly the energy region where bands of NO adsorbed on W species appear, do not allow a quantification of the spectra. However, in the energy region relative to Ni species some qualitative differences, such as that the intensity of the 1881 cm- ~ band compared to that at 1847 cm-1 for the fluoride-free catalyst is relatively higher than those for the other catalysts, can be observed. Similar observations are found when the 352 A.

These observations suggest that the ratio of sulfided to oxidic Ni species seems to increase slightly with the fluoride content. 3.6. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) The XPS results for the sulfided NiW/A1-F(x) catalysts are summarized in Table 2. It can be observed that the values of the binding energy (BE) for the F l s leve! in all the fluoride-containing catalysts were practically constant (685.6 _+ 0.2 eV), and very close within the experimental error to the values of 685.2-685.9 eV reported previously for F- species supported on alumina [10,12-16,18,37], indicating that no interaction between F- ions and the W or Ni species exists. Similarly, the BE values of the S 2p level, which fluctuated between 161.8 and 161.9 eV, were very close to the 162.2 eV value reported for S2- ions [12,14,15]. Furthermore, the absence of other peaks at higher BEs pointed out to the absence of significant amounts of sulfur species with a higher oxidation state. The XPS profiles of Ni 2p3/2 and W 4f levels were, however, more complex, as can be observed in Figs. 4 and 5. The Ni 2p3/2 spectrum (Fig. 4) presents a relatively intense peak at 853.8 eV and a second broad band overlapped partially with the first one, with a maximum at about 856.3 eV together with another peak at ca. 863 eV. The value of the BE of the first peak is close to the characteristic values reported for the Ni 2P3/2 level in NiS (854.9 eV) and Table 2 XPS results of the sulfided catalysts NiW/AI-F(0) NiW/A1F(0.2) NiW/A1-F(0.8) NiW/AI-F(1.5) NiW/AI-F(2.5) XPS BE (eV) A1 2p 74.5 74.5 74.5 74.5 74.5 S 2p 161.9 161.9 161.8 161.8 161.8 F Is - 685.6 685.8 685.6 685.8 W 4f7/2 32.3 (58) a 32.4 (56) 32.5 (51) 32.3 (49) 32.3 (49) - 35.7 (42) - 35.7 (44) - 35.9 (49) - 35.7 (51) - 35.9 (51) Ni 2p3/2 853.9 (66) 853.7 (63) 853.8 (64) 853.8 (60) 853.7 (59) - 86.2 (34) - 856.1 (37) - 856.2 (36) - 856.4 (40) - 856.5 (4 l) Quantitative results (atom) F/A1 - 0.028 0.053 0.087 0.140 W/AI 0.060 0.059 0.055 0.055 0.045 Ni/A1 0.019 0.016 0.015 0.015 0.011 S/AI 0.112 0.100 0.091 0.084 0.064 Wsu/Wto b 0.58 0.56 0.51 0.49 0.49 Ni~u/Nitb 0.66 0.63 0.64 0.60 0.59 S/(Ni + W) 1.42 1.41 1.32 1.13 1.16 a Values in parentheses are the percentages of the area of the deconvoluted peak with respect to the total area of the peak. b Fraction of sulfided W (or Ni) with respect to total W (or Ni) species.

The other peaks with BE at 856.3 eV and ca. 863 eV correspond to Ni species in an oxidic surrounding, probably Ni203 or NiA1204 and to the characteristic satellite peak of Ni2+ species. [15,38,39]. The presence of this satellite peak indicates, in agreement with the IR-NO adsorption results, that a part of the Ni incorporated to the catalyst remains in oxidic state or only partially sulfided. Most probably, these non sulfided Ni species are those in interaction with the alumina support forming NiA1204 like species which are non-sulfidable. The percentages of sulfided and oxidized Ni phases were obtained by synthesising the experimental peaks using a Gaussian/Lorentzian 354 A.

From the deconvolution of the peaks, it was estimated that approximately 50% of the W phase remained unsulfided (see Table 2). It is apparent from the results in Table 2 that the percentage of sulfided W species tends to decrease slightly with increasing F- loading. The atomic ratio of F 2p/A1 2p, W 4f/A1 2p, Ni 2p/A1 2p and S 2p/Al 2p calculated from the XPS data are also shown in Table 2. The plot of the F 2p/A1 2p ratio as a function of the bulk atomic fluoride to aluminium ratio (F/AI)b shows (Fig. 6a) that the F 2p/Al 2p atomic ratio increases linearly until the 1.0 wt.-% F- content is reached (17 1013 F- atoms cm-2) and then deviates slightly from linearity at higher F- loadings, indicating that F- is uniformly and well dispersed over the A1203 surface up to 1.0 wt.-% F-, and that above this value the distribution on the surface changes and departs from monolayer dispersion. This result is in line with previous findings [37] that showed the F- monolayer capacity at 12.1013 F- at cm-2. The W 4f/Al 2p atomic ratio, as Fig. 6b shows, decreases progressively with increasing F- concentration. This decrease, together with the fact that all the experimental W 4f/Al 2p atomic ratios were considerably lower than the theoretical monolayer value of 0.096 estimated according the Kerkhoff and Moulijn model [40], strongly suggests that the dispersion of the supported W species decreases with 356 A.

A decrease of about 25% for the catalyst with the highest F- content as compared with the fluoride-free catalyst is observed. In line with the above findings, the Ni 2p/A1 2p atom ratios (Fig. 6c) also decreases similarly as the fluoride loading is increased. Consequently, fluoride addition probably reduces the Ni dispersion. Moreover, on the basis that the experimental values of Fig. 6c are very low compared to the theoretical one (0.028) calculated according the Kerkhoff and Moulijn model [40], the Ni dispersion is apparently very low. Table 2 shows that the S 2p/A1 2p and S 2p/(W 4f + Ni 2p) ratios, which may reflect the extent of sulfidation of the catalyst, decrease with increasing fluoride content. 3. 7.

It can be observed that at 573 and 598 K the HDS activity is practically invariable with fluoride content while at 623 K increases slightly as the fluoride content is increased. On the contrary, the HYD activity decreases almost linearly with increasing fluoride content at the three reaction temperatures. 3. 7.2.

Effect of fluoride on the catalysts structure and dispersion of the active phase The constancy of the BE of the F 2p line throughout the NiW/A1-F(x) catalysts series, and the absence of extra peaks, indicates that no significant amounts of different fluoride compounds other than the replacement of alumina hydroxyl groups by fluoride are present. Therefore, the presence of significant A1F3 and other fluoride compounds with W or Ni can be neglected. Also, by X-ray diffraction, the presence of a discrete A1F3 phase in the calcined NiW/A1-F(x) catalysts was not detected, as it was also observed previously for unpromoted W/A1-F(x) catalysts [22]. Concerning the dispersion of W and Ni in the calcined catalysts the absence of X-ray diffraction lines due to Ni or W oxides indicates that both Ni and W may be present as amorphous phases and/or in the form of small crystallites of less than 40 A; at this macroscale, fluoridation of alumina apparently does not affect the distribution of W and Ni. However, the results from DRS (calcined catalysts) and XPS (sulfided catalysts) do reveal that fluoride incorporation changes significantly the surface distribution of W and Ni. Furthermore, the broadening and slight shift observed in the DRS band due to W6+ tetrahedrally coordinated for the F-containing catalysts indicates that, as the fluoride content is raised, the fraction of octahedral W6+ species is significantly increased. A similar variation in the DR spectra was previously observed for W/A1-F(x) catalysts [22], where Raman spectra confirmed that alumina fluoridation favoured the formation of polytungstate species, and TPR results showed an increase in reducibility of the supported W species as fluoride concentration was increased. In line with this, the quantitative XPS results of Fig. 6b indicate that the dispersion of the W phase decreases progressively with the fluoride content. This decrease in the dispersion observed by XPS of the W phase may be due in part to the drop in surface area of the support, caused by the corrosive action of high concentrations of fluoride, the deposit of small amounts of the alumina solubilized by the corrosive process on the top of the W phase, and also to the diminished interaction between the W species and the F-modified alumina, which leads to the aggregation of W species in the form of polytungstates as in the case for unpromoted W/A1-F(x) catalysts [22]. All this should lead to a better sulfidation of the W phase when fluoride is increased. However the W,u/Wto ratio from XPS apparently indicates a contrary effect: that increased fluoride reduces the level of sulfidation of the W phase. On the other hand, an analysis of the surface population and architecture of the WS2 crystallites made by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) of the present sulfided NiW/A1-F(x) catalysts has recently shown that fluoride addition enhances significantly sulfidation and the growing of the WS2 structures, mainly A. Ben#ez et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 343-364 359 in the lateral direction [41]. Similarly, clear evidence for the enhanced sulfida- tion induced by fluoride has been also shown for W/A1-F(x) catalysts with HRTEM [24]. These observations can then be rationalized by considering that the degree of sulfidation of the W species obtained from XPS is probably underestimated since this technique probes only a few surface layers of the catalyst. Thus the large particles of W species, which are more sulfidable, are possibly being only partially 'seen' by XPS. It is remarkable that the compari- son of the W/AI ratio with the W~Wto fraction shows a dissimilarity in the relative decrease of such parameters with fluoride content. Thus, while the W~u/Wto ratio decreased only about 15% (for the NiW/A1-F(2.5) catalyst relative to the fluoride-free counterpart), the W/A1 ratio decreased about 25%. This fact can be taken as indicative of a relatively higher sulfidation of the fluoride-containing catalyst. In addition to this, the possibility cannot be ex- cluded that some surface WO4- species would be only partially sulfided to WO3$2- species, in which tungsten is still in the + 6 state and their XPS signal could be obscured by the original W6+ signal in an oxidic surrounding. In this case, the W~u/Wto ratio would not reflect the actual level of sulfidation of the W phase. On the other hand, although the ratio of sulfur to metal atoms (W and Ni), as detected from XPS, could be used to estimate the level of sulfidation of the catalysts, the aluminium solubilized during the impregnation steps, due to the acidic pH, and its re-deposition upon calcination can partially obscure the detection of W and Ni, again introducing uncertainty in the values of the S/Al and S/(W + Ni) ratios and rendering such XPS data an unreliable guide to know the actual level of catalyst sulfidation. As far as the Ni dispersion is concerned, the XPS results of Fig. 6c show that fluoride induces a slight decrease in the dispersion of Ni, which is consistent with the also small increase in the Ni(O)/Ni(T) ratio determined by DRS (Table 1). This change in the surface distribution of Ni in favour of more sulfidable Ni(O) species should lead to an increase of the fraction of Ni in sulfided state, as suggested by the relative change in the band intensity of IR-NO adsorption on sulfided and oxidic Ni2+ ions (Fig. 3a). In contrast, the XPS data of the Ni~u/Nito fraction suggested a slight decrease in the extent of Ni-sulfided from about 66% for the fluoride-free catalyst to about 59% for the 2.5 wt.-c/c F--containing catalysts. These contradictory observations on the relative level of sulfidation of Ni are similar to those described above for W, and can therefore be accounted for in a similar way. In this case the relative decrease in the Ni/A1 ratio is approximately of 42% whereas in the Ni~u/Nito is only of about 11%, when the fluoride-free catalyst is compared with the NiW/AI-F(2.5) catalyst. This high dissimilarity suggests that sulfidation of the Ni species is relatively more easy to achieve when fluoride content is increased. In addition, there is the possibility that a small amount of NiSO4 (Ni 2p3/2 BE = 857.8 eV) can be produced by oxidation of nickel sulfide during transfer and pressing of the XPS samples [42]. The Ni 2p3/2 peak observed at ca. 856.3 eV is broad and could 360 A. Ben#ez et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 343-364 mask a small peak at 857.8 eV corresponding to NiSO4. This form of Ni could also help to explain the disagreement between XPS data and other techniques on the influence of the F- on the sulfidation degree, because this Ni combined to S was not taken into account in the Nisu/Nito calculated of Table 2. In every case, the S 2p contribution in the region of ca. 168.2 eV, where sulfate species are expected to appear, was negligible. In order to solve the discrepancies of the sulfidation degree between XPS and other techniques, the overall sulfur content was determined by chemical analy- sis. The measured sulfur content for the sulfided NiW/AI-F(0), NiW/A1-F(0.2) and NiW/A1-F(2.5) catalysts was 3.32%, 3.35% and 3.48%, respectively. As the theoretical expected sulfur content, if all the WO3 and NiO were converted to sulfides, would be 6.66%, the experimental sulfidation degree resulted in 49.8% for the NiW/A1-F(0), 50.3% for the NiW/A1-F(0.2), and 52.3% for the NiW/A1-F(2.5) catalyst. Thus, these values confirm that the sulfidation degree increases only slightly with increasing fluoride content. The fact that the alumina fluoridation increased slightly the number of acid sites of sulfided NiW/AI203, as observed previously for NiMo/AI203 cata- lysts [16], can be explained by the creation of -SH acid groups on the sulfided metal phases (most probably on WS2), and the regeneration upon sulfidation of some acid groups on the support as a result of the breaking of the oxygen bridges between the W and the Al. Thus, according to the results presented in Table 1, these two processes of acid sites formation seem to be favoured by the addition of fluoride. We have also seen before that alumina fluoridation decreases the dispersion of the W phase, leaving therefore a higher fraction of bare alumina surface where acid groups can exist, and it also facilitates the sulfidation of the W species and, consequently, the formation of acidic -SH groups. The latter sulfidation process of the supported oxidic tungstates is most probably responsible for the slight decrease in the strength of the acid sites which is observed with increasing fluoride. This suggestion is based on the observation that with fluoride incorporation the strength of the acid sites increased slightly for the calcined NiW/A1-F(x) catalysts [43], while the reverse is observed for the sulfided catalysts. It is suggested, in line with previous findings, that the presence of stronger acid sites in the calcined NiW/A1-F(x) catalysts might be due to the inductive effect of the fluoride- modified alumina, coupled with a terminal oxygen effect of supported tungstates [44]. Moreover, the appearance of strong BriSnsted acidity in WO3/A1203 samples has been recently attributed by Zhang et al. [45] to a charge delocaliza- tion into the support due to terminal oxygen atoms. 4.2. Effect of fluoride on catalytic activity From Fig. 7 is evident that the activity of the NiW/A1-F(x) catalysts for thiophene HDS is hardly promoted by the fluoridation of the alumina support. A. Benltez et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996)343-364 361 The small positive effect of fluoride addition on thiophene HDS may be related, on first sight, to the also small variations in the surface distribution of Ni and W species described above, which are essentially a decrease in the dispersion of the sulfided Ni and W phases and probably a slight improvement in their sulfidation as a result of the small increase in the fraction of the Ni octahedrally coordinated and the formation of polytungstate species in the calcined catalysts. Apparently, the negative effect of a smaller dispersion of W seems to be compensated by the beneficial effect of a better sulfidation of the metal phases and possibly also by a higher number of promoted WS2 structures, as well as a higher acidity. However, the activity for the subsequent butene HYD reaction was significantly decreased (Fig. 8) when the fluoride content was increased. As the decrease in HYD activity is parallel to a decrease in the dispersion of W, it might be thought that in this case the parameter which is decisive for HYD activity is the W dispersion and then catalyst sulfidation. This suggestion is consistent with the results obtained previously for Ni(Co)Mo/A1-F(x) catalysts [13], where the cyclohexene HYD activity correlated positively with Mo dispersion, increasing with the fluoride concentration. The different behaviour of the present catalysts for thiophene HDS and butene HYD confirms once more that such reactions take place on distinct active sites. This change in HYD/HDS selectivity reflects a change in the relative distribution of the active sites for the two reactions, which could be attributed to a variation in the proportion of sites with different numbers of sulfur vacancies on the edges or corners of the WS2 structures, i.e. distinct coordinatively-un- saturated W atoms (CUS W), and/or to the creation of neighbouring -SH groups. In general, the active sites for different hydrotreating reactions (on metal sulfides) are considered to be different CUS. Thus, the sites active for HYD are widely accepted to be 3-CUS [46,47], whereas for HDS there is no agreement yet. However, an interesting proposal has been made by Delmon et al. [48], who proposed that the active sites for HDS reactions is a 3-CUS Mo and a -SH in the vicinity, with which the thiophenic sulfur would interact. Taking these proposals for the active sites into account, as fluoride incorporation in the present catalysts brings out an increase in acidity (partially due to W-SH), we suggest that the change in the HYD/HDS activity could be considered mainly as the result of a partial interconversion of the HYD sites to HDS sites, as a consequence of the surface redistribution of the metal phase and their easier sulfidation induced by fluoride addition. This explanation is, however, insufficient since the relative change in activity for HDS as a function of fluoride content is different to that obtained for HYD, and especially at low reaction temperatures. On the other hand, on the basis that fluoridation induce some morphology changes in the supported MoS2 [49] and WS2 [24,41] structures, another explanation might be envisaged considering, for instance, the 'rim-edge' geometrical model proposed by Daage and Chianelly [50]. However, the HREM examinations in the present sulfided NiW(AI-F(x) catalysts [40], in contrast with the observed for the 362 A. Benftez et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 343-364 unpromoted W/A1-F(x) counterparts [24], indicated that the average stacking of the WS2 crystallites was almost constant and the average length increased only slightly with increasing fluoride content. Thus, the small changes in the diame- ter/height ratio of the WS2 crystallites for the sulfided NiW/A1-F(x) catalysts cannot by itself account for the change in the HYD/HDS activity ratio. Most probably, this change in selectivity is the result of the simultaneous existence of various effects such as metal dispersion, morphology changes, sulfidation extent and formation of different CUS and associated -SH groups, with some or all of them interdependent. As shown in Fig. 9, the activity for pyridine HDN is improved significantly with alumina fluoridation. Comparison of these results with those for HDS (Fig. 7) show that the promoting effect of fluoride is relatively much stronger for HDN than for HDS. A similar result has been noticed before for unpromoted W/A1-F(x) catalysts in the simultaneous HDS and HDN of gas oil and pyridine [24]. These findings indicate that the structural changes in the W and Ni phases described above lead to a relatively major increase in the number of active sites for HDN than for HDS, and also confirm that different catalytic sites from those implied in HDS are involved in HDN. Since HDN requires two different type of sites (hydrogenation and C-N bond cleavage), and in the present case the relative proportion of HYD sites decreases according to the results for butene HYD (Fig. 8), we can conclude that the fluoride promotion for pyridine HDN is mainly due to an increase in the acidic sites active for the C-N bond cleavage step. Consistently, the acidity results of Table l show that the concentration of acid sites increases slightly with increasing fluoride content. These acid sites induced by fluoridation would be particularly active in the C-N bond cleavage as suggested by the reaction product distribution where n-pentane was predomi- nant and the selectivity for this product increased with increasing fluoride concentration [51]. Such acid sites are probably associated with the support, but the possibility that they may be also due to -SH groups associated with the WS2 phase cannot be excluded. These results would also indicate that, in our experiments, the hydrogenation step is not the rate-determining step on the overall pyridine HDN reaction. 5. Conclusions The results of this study have led to the following conclusions: (1) fluoride is incorporated on the alumina surface uniformly well disperse in the form of monolayer up to approximately 1.0 wt.-% F- and slightly less homogeneously at higher fluoride contents; (2) the effect of fluoride addition, previously to the incorporation of the metal phases, on the structure of NiW/A1203 catalysts is to decrease the Ni and W dispersion as result of the aggregation of the W species in the form of polytungstates; (3) this change in metal dispersion and the A. Benltez et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 144 (1996) 343-364 363 decreased interaction of the tungstate with the support leads to a slight improve- ment in the sulfidation of the Ni and particularly of the W phase; (4) catalyti- cally the alumina fluoridation has almost no effect on the activity for thiophene HDS, a negative effect on the subsequent butene HYD and a positive effect on pyridine HDN, indicating that the net effect of fluoride is to change the relative proportion of the sites active for the three reactions, including an increase in surface acidity which enhances the C-N bond cleavage step in the pyridine HDN reaction.

The effect of adding different amounts of fluoride to a γ-alumina used as support of NiW/Al2O3 catalysts was investigated using X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed NO (IR-NO), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), surface acidity, specific surface area and catalytic activity measurements. The catalytic activity was evaluated by two model reactions, namely thiophene hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and pyridine hydrogenation (HDN), in the temperature range 573–623 K using a flow system operated at 2 MPa (HDS) or 3 MPa (HDN) total pressure. DRS results of the oxidic precursors suggested that the effect of fluoride incorporation to the alumina support is that it increases slightly the octahedrally coordinated fractions of Ni and W. The XPS results of the sulfided catalysts showed that the dispersion of the Ni and W phases decreased progressively with increasing fluoride content. This technique also showed that these phases were only partially sulfided under the present experimental sulfiding conditions, and that the extent of sulfidation of such phases apparently tends to decrease slightly with increasing fluoride content, in contrast with the results suggested by the IR-NO spectra. The sulfur content of sulfided samples, as measured by chemical analysis, revelated that the sulfidation degree increased only slightly with increasing fluoride content. The activity for thiophene HDS was almost invariant with fluoride addition, but the subsequent hydrogenation of the intermediate products (butenes) was found to decrease linearly with the fluoride content. Possible interpretations for these changes in activity and selectivity, which reflect changes in the relative distribution of the different active sites for the two reactions, are discussed in relation with the structural variations of the active phases described above. In contrast, the activity for pyridine HDN increased considerably with the incorporation of small amounts of fluoride; this increase is mainly attributed to the increase in surface acidity which was observed with fluoride addition.
