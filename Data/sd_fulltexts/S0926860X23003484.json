Understanding the influence of ppm level Pt loading on catalytic behavior is critical to the design of efficient catalysts with minimized Pt utilization. Here we investigate the influence of Pt loading (≤ 500 ppm) in HZSM-5 on the catalytic behavior of ethane and propane dehydroaromatization (DHA). We show that the activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalyst are highly dependent upon Pt loading. While 500 and 100 ppm catalysts show nearly the same turnover number (TON) in both ethane and propane DHA, the TON decreased and the average rate of coking (per gram catalyst basis) increased with decreasing Pt loading to 50 ppm. The 50 ppm Pt/HZSM-5 failed to form the optimized [Ptm-Hn]n+ adduct due to the limited Pt availability at the nearby T12 and T8 sites. Consequently, the minimum Pt loading is between 50 and 100 ppm for the maximized intrinsic metal functionality for light alkanes DHA over the monometallic Pt/HZSM-5 catalyst. Graphical Abstract ga1 Keywords Light alkanes Dehydroaromatization Pt loading HZSM-5 Metal functionality Data Availability Data will be made available on request. 1 Introduction The transformations of cheap and abundant light alkanes through dehydroaromatization (DHA) is one of the most challenging catalytic processes with far-reaching implications (ranging from on-purpose aromatics production to more efficient alkane utilization) in the area of hydrocarbon processing [1]. Such a process simultaneously produces aromatics (mainly BTX, or benzene, toluene, and xylenes) and olefins typically over a metal/acid bi-functional catalyst through complicated reaction networks, including dehydrogenation on the metal sites, and oligomerization/cracking and cyclization over the acid sites [2]. In terms of the acid functionality, the HZSM-5 zeolite with MFI structure has been most widely studied because the pore diameter of the 3D framework structure of the ZSM-5 zeolite is similar to the diameters of BTX molecules, ⁓ 6 Å, which induces shape selectivity by suppressing heavier molecule formation [1]. With respect to the metal functionality, the metal sites in the forms of metal/metal oxide clusters and Lewis acid metalδ+ cations, etc., are essential to the initial C-H bond dehydrogenation [1,3], and could facilitate the release of H2 through hydrogen back-spillover [4–6]. Although the different metals, such as Pt [7–9], Zn [10–13], Ga [14–16], Re [17], and Mo [18,19], modified HZSM-5 catalysts are known to be active in light alkanes DHA, only the Ga/HZSM-5 catalyst has been applied in the Cyclar industry process (a process for propane and butane DHA) [20], and the state-of-the-art DHA catalyst still faces challenges of inadequate activity and stability for the DHA of ethane. Among various catalysts, the Pt/HZSM-5 catalyst shows relatively higher activity in both ethane and propane DHA and dehydrogenation. The related catalysts and processes for ethane DHA have frequently been patented [9,21–26], probably due to the high potential for industrial applications. From a fundamental point of view, the Pt0 nanoparticle (on SiO2 or Al2O3) and the electron-deficient, [Ptm-Hn]n+, metal-proton adducts (in aluminosilicate zeolites) demonstrated a high affinity with the paraffinic C-H bond [27–29], which renders its exceptional performance in hydrocarbon conversions. According to the H/D exchange, the C-H bond of ethane can be activated at temperatures as low as 225°C over the Pt nanoparticle [30]. Consequently, the bi-functional Pt-modified aluminosilicate zeolites have been extensively employed for the hydroconversion of alkanes. While Pt/HZSM-5 is one of the most active catalysts in hydrocarbon conversion and has been extensively studied for light alkane DHA [1,7,31–38], most of the published works use up to 0.1–1 wt % of Pt loading in the catalyst, the cost of which is approximately 10–100 times of the 1 wt % Ga/HZSM-5. The high cost and scarcity of Pt have strongly restricted the application of Pt/HZSM-5 catalyst in DHA. Therefore, this challenge has previously driven the development of an efficient bimetallic catalyst with ultra-low loading of Pt (0.001–0.05 wt %) in our group [39]. A Pt loading of 0.04 wt % was also reported in previous patents filed by Shell with a bimetallic system [9,21–26]. However, to the best of our knowledge, the catalytic behavior of the ultralow loading (≤500 ppm or 0.05 wt %) monometallic Pt/HZSM-5 in ethane and propane DHA has not been systematically evaluated, which is essential to understand the metal/acid bifunctionality of the ppm Pt in HZSM-5 for DHA. It might be expected that decreasing the metal loading to ppm level could be associated with the change of both structural and electrical properties of the metal species, which influences the catalytic behavior due to the well-known concept of “structure-sensitivity” [40–44] and electronic metal/support interaction [45]. According to Reschetilowski et al. [34], the higher dispersion and smaller particle size of Pt could lead to closer proximity between metal and acid sites, which increases the electron deficiency of the Pt clusters not desired for ethane DHA because it stabilizes the platinum-ethylene complex, leading to the formation of heavier oligomers (coke precursor) due to the scaling relationship. Similar size-dependent kinetics and mechanisms for propane dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts were discussed by Chen and coworkers [46]. Besides the “particle size effect”, decreasing the metal loading in such Pt/zeolite bifunctional catalysts might also influence the catalytic performance due to the reduced metal functionality. For example, to optimize the metal/acid bifunctionality for alkanes hydroisomerization, Guisnet and coworkers suggested that a minimum ratio of surface Pt to Brønsted acid sites of 0.1 is required for the Pt/HY catalyst [47], which corresponds to > 0.3 wt % Pt loading. In this work, the influence of Pt weight loading (≤ 500 ppm) on the catalytic behavior of both ethane and propane DHA in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability was comprehensively studied. The Pt species’ metal functionality and its deactivation were investigated based on ethane/D2 isotopic exchange. The amount of coke deposition on the deactivated catalyst was quantified by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Our results suggested that the formation of the optimal Pt cluster size failed after decreasing Pt loading to ≤ 50 ppm, influencing significantly the metal functionality of the Pt species for ethane and propane DHA as well as ethane/D2 exchange. Specifically, the 50 ppm Pt/HZSM-5 catalyst show a higher coking rate, leading to accelerated deactivation and lower turnover number (TON) than the 100 and 500 ppm Pt/HZSM-5 catalysts. Therefore, the minimum Pt weight loading is between 50 and 100 ppm in order to maximize the intrinsic metal functionality of the monometallic Pt/HZSM-5 catalyst for light alkane DHA. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The Pt/HZSM-5 catalysts with different Pt loading were synthesized through wet impregnation. The HZSM-5 was obtained through the calcination of NH4-ZSM-5 (purchased from VWR International with SiO2/Al2O3 = 30) at 560 °C for 6 h in a muffle furnace. Specifically, 1 g of HZSM-5 powder was impregnated with 10 mL of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 aqueous solution. The concentration of the solution was adjusted to obtain Pt nominal weight loading of 500, 100, and 50 ppm, respectively (the Pt loading according to ICP is 511, 106, and 47 ppm, respectively). The impregnation was first performed at room temperature for 2 h under stirring, then the slurry was transferred to a rotary evaporator to remove water at 65 °C under 150 mbar. The obtained sample was dried at 120 °C for 12 h and calcined in a tube furnace under flowing dry air at 550 °C (ramp 5 °C/min) for 6 h. The obtained powder samples were pelletized and crushed to 20–45 mesh before being loaded into the reactor for performance test. The catalysts were noted as Pt500, Pt100, and Pt50, respectively. 2.2 Catalytic testing The catalytic reaction was performed on a Micromeritics Autochem 2910 setup equipped with an online mass spectrometer (MS). Typically, 0.1 g of catalyst was mixed with 0.4 g of silica sand (pretreated with 70 % HNO3 overnight and calcined at 650 °C for 5 h) and then loaded into the U-shape quartz reactor (ID 10 mm). The catalyst was reduced in 10 % H2/Ar with a flow rate of 20 mL/min at 650 °C (ramp10 °C/min) for 20 min then decreased the temperature (under 10 % H2) to 550 °C for ethane dehydroaromatization (DHA) or to 450 °C for propane DHA. During the cooling of the reactor temperature, the flow (by-pass the reactor) of pure ethane (Airgas, Technical grade) or propane (GR 2.0) was set to 20 mL/min without any other diluent gas, corresponding to a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of ∼6000 h−1. The spectra of pure Ar and ethane (or propane) were collected for the MS calibration at the same time. The catalytic reaction was initiated by abruptly switching the reactor inlet from 10 % H2/Ar to ethane or propane under atmospheric pressure using a six-way valve. The reactor effluent was measured using the online Agilent 5973 MS (equipped with MS Sensor 2.0 software, Diablo Analytical, Inc.). In order to make a quantitative analysis using the MS, various mass-to-charge ratios, such as m/z = 16, m/z = 27, m/z = 30, m/z = 40, m/z = 41, m/z = 44, m/z = 56, m/z = 58, m/z = 70, m/z = 78, m/z = 84, m/z = 92 and m/z = 106, were monitored simultaneously. The detailed method of MS quantification can be found in our previous work [48]. 2.3 Temperature-programmed ethane/D2 exchange Temperature-programmed ethane/D2 exchange was performed on a homemade setup equipped with an online mass spectrometer (Leybold Inficon TSP TH100 Transpector Residual Gas Analyzer). To compare the exchange activity based on the same metal loading, the catalyst loading for Pt500, Pt100, and Pt50 catalysts was 0.02, 0.1, and 0.2 g, respectively. The catalyst was activated with an H2/N2 mixture to 650 °C for 20 min, after which the temperature of the reactor was decreased to 100 °C, and then the reactor inlet was switched to a mixture of D2/C2H6 (flow rates are 4 and 16 mL/min, respectively). Finally, the temperature of the reactor was increased to 400 °C at 5 °C/min. During ethane/D2 exchange, the signals of m/z = 2 (H2), m/z = 3 (HD), m/z = 4 (D2), m/z = 30 (C2H6) and m/z = 31 (C2H5D), and m/z = 32 (C2H4D2) were recorded. Noteworthily, the formation of C2H4D2 is significantly lower than C2H5D under the employed conditions, therefore, only the rate of C2H5D formation was considered. 2.4 Catalyst characterization A Discovery Series TGA 550 (TA Instruments) was used to quantify the coke deposition in the deactivated Pt500, Pt100, and Pt50 catalysts after ethane DHA for 17, 5, and 1 h, respectively. The sample was pre-treated under N2 at 300 °C for 16 h to remove the adsorbed impurities and was heated to 700 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min under a dry air atmosphere. A Micromeritics Tristar II 3020 analyzer was utilized for determining the liquid nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms of the fresh and used catalysts. The sample was degassed at 300 °C under vacuum for 16 h prior to N2 adsorption/desorption measurement at 77 K. Specifically, pore volumes of samples were estimated from desorption isotherms at 77 K using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model, whereas surface areas were determined from Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the used catalysts were obtained using a JEOL 2100 transmission electron microscope (accelerating voltage 200 kV) equipped with a Gatan camera. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Ethane and propane DHA catalytic performance The catalytic performance of the Pt/HZSM-5 catalysts, with Pt loading of 50, 100, and 500 ppm, respectively, during ethane DHA will be mainly discussed based on ethane conversion, BTX selectivity, and specific activities (ethane to BTX, olefin, and paraffin, respectively) as a function of time on stream (TOS), as well as the TON of ethane to different products after total deactivation. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the initial ethane conversion is around 17 % over the Pt500 catalyst and the lifespan of the catalyst is around 18 h. However, the initial conversion decreased to 13 % for the Pt100 catalyst, which totally deactivated within 4 h. Further decreasing the Pt loading to 50 ppm shows a decrease of the initial conversion to 6 % and the lifespan of the catalyst to only 1 h. In terms of the selectivity to BTX (Fig. 1(b)), Pt500 shows an initial selectivity of up to 60 %, which decreases significantly during the first 0.8 h to around 45 % (the same as the initial selectivity of Pt100), then decreased almost linearly with TOS to 20 % after 15 h. Quite similar to ethane conversion, BTX selectivity over the Pt100 and Pt50 decreases faster with TOS than Pt500 catalyst. The BTX selectivity decreased to < 10 % after TOS of 3.5 h and 0.85 h for Pt100 and Pt50, respectively. The conversion and BTX selectivity behavior shown in panels (a) and (b) correspond to the same features of the activity patterns (see Fig. 1(c)–(e)). It is seen that the initial activity of ethane to BTX decreases significantly and the rate of deactivation increases with decreasing Pt loading from 500 to 50 ppm. The activity is up to 800 μmol/g/min for the Pt500, which decreases significantly during the first 0.8 h to around 500 μmol/g/min (the same as the initial activity of Pt100), then totally deactivated after 17 h. Whereas, the Pt50 catalyst start with an initial activity around 100 μmol/g/min, which quickly deactivated within TOS of only 1 h. The activity of ethane to total paraffin (methane, propane, and butane) shows a very similar trend to the activity of ethane to BTX. The initial activity is only 200 μmol/g/min over the Pt500, indicating the relatively low selectivity to paraffin during ethane DHA under the investigated conditions (see Fig. S1 for selectivity of paraffin and olefin). In terms of the activity of ethane to total olefin (ethylene, propylene, and butylene), both Pt500 and Pt100 show initial activities of around 450 μmol/g/min and Pt50 shows an initial activity of around 300 μmol/g/min. The activity of olefin formation deactivates slower than the activities of BTX and paraffin. As shown in Fig. S2, the reactivity coefficient “a” (the time-dependent activity normalized by the initial activity) of olefin decreases slower (indicating a smaller deactivation constant) than that for BTX and paraffin. Olefins, especially ethylene the key reaction intermediate for BTX and C3+ paraffin are produced on the metal sites through dehydrogenation; whereas, the formation of BTX and C3+ paraffin from ethylene relies on both metal and acid sites. Therefore, the deactivation of the metal functionality (for ethane dehydrogenation) is slower than the synergized metal/acid bifunctionality (for BTX formation). The catalytic performance discussed above demonstrated that the activity of ethane DHA and the stability of such catalysts are dependent highly upon the Pt loading in the acidic HZSM-5 zeolite. Therefore, the activities of ethane to BTX, paraffin, and olefin shown in panels (c)-(e) were converted into TON (cumulative products formation from ethane normalized by the amount of Pt in the catalyst, see Fig. S3). As shown in Fig. 1(f), the Pt500 and Pt100 catalysts show very similar TONs for ethane to olefin, BTX, and paraffin, respectively. The total TON of ethane is up to 0.2 million molethane/molPt under the investigated conditions. The similar TONs over the Pt500 and Pt100 catalysts suggested that the structure and properties of the Pt species in the HZSM-5 zeolite are similar when the Pt loading is between 100 and 500 ppm. However, the total TONs over the Pt50 catalyst is only 50 thousand, which is 1/4th of that over the Pt100 and Pt500 catalysts. Therefore, the structure and properties of the Pt species in the Pt50 catalyst must be different from that in the Pt100 and Pt500 catalysts, and such structured Pt species in HZSM-5 are less stable (coke-resistant) during ethane DHA. The catalytic performance of Pt500, Pt100, and Pt50 catalysts during propane DHA are similarly compiled in Fig. 2 to that for ethane DHA. It is seen that propane DHA at 450 °C shows similar activity to the ethane DHA at 550 °C, whereas the catalysts are more stable (coke resistant) due to the lower reaction temperature. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the propane conversion over the Pt500 remains at 11.4 % after TOS of 16 h, decreasing ⁓31.8 % of the initial activity. Over the Pt100 catalyst, propane conversion was decreased from 10 % to 5.9 %, corresponding to ⁓41 % of deactivation. Whereas, propane conversion over the Pt50 catalyst after TOS of 16 h is only 3.2 %, slightly higher than that over the HZSM-5 (2.6 %), indicating almost total deactivation of the metal functionality. The selectivity of BTX is also highly dependent upon the Pt loading (Fig. 2(b)), decreasing (initial selectivity) from 40 % to 15 % with decreasing Pt loading from 500 to 50 ppm. The critical role of Pt metal functionality on BTX formation further can be found in the activity of propane to BTX (Fig. 2(c)). While the initial activity is up to 550 μmol/g/min over the Pt500 catalyst, it decreased to around 200 μmol/g/min over the Pt100 and further decreased to 68 μmol/g/min over the Pt50 catalyst. The pure HZSM-5, although, is active for propane conversion [49], produces mainly paraffin (with significant amounts of CH4) and olefins under the investigated conditions, and the formation of BTX over the HZSM-5 is negligible. In the absence of Pt, propane was activated through cracking (C3H8 → CH4 + C2H4) on the Brønsted acid site of the HZSM-5 [49], which is different from the dehydrogenation mechanism on the Pt/HZSM-5 catalyst. Further catalytic results of the 1 and 10 ppm Pt/HZSM-5 can be found in Fig. S4. It is seen that Pt1 and Pt10 show almost identical activity as the HZSM-5, indicating the absence of Pt metal functionality for DHA. In terms of the activity of total olefin (Fig. 2(d)) and paraffin (Fig. 2(e)), it is seen that propane DHA produces significantly more amounts of paraffin (mainly ethane + butane) than olefin (mainly propylene + butylene). The selectivity of propane to paraffin and olefin can be found in Fig. S5. The formation of ethane and butane from propane was realized through the oligomerization of propylene (2C3H6 → C6H12) followed by cracking (C6H12 → C2H4 + C4H8) and hydrogenation (C2H4 + H2 → C2H6). The initial activities of propane to different products as a function of Pt loading are summarized in Fig. 2(f), which all increase with increasing Pt loading, indicating the critical role of Pt metal functionality on propane conversion, although pure HZSM-5 is also active. The same as ethane DHA, the catalytic performance of propane DHA in terms of both activity and stability is also dependent highly upon the Pt loading in the acidic HZSM-5 zeolite. In order to calculate the TON of propane converted to BTX during the lifespan of the catalysts, deactivation kinetics were evaluated based on the generalized power-law equation (GPLE) model [50,51]. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the deactivation of propane to BTX on the Pt500 and Pt100 catalysts follows strictly the first-order GPLE model ( ln a = − k deactiv . × t , where “a” is the reactivity coefficient). The deactivation rate constant (k deactiv ) is 0.038 h−1 for Pt500 and 0.06 h−1 for Pt100. However, the deactivation of the Pt50 catalyst deviates significantly from the first-order GPLE model, which again suggested that the chemical properties of the Pt species in Pt50 are different from that in the Pt100 and Pt500. Noteworthily, the deactivation of Pt500 and Pt100 catalysts during ethane DHA also deviates from the first-order GPLE model [39], indicating that different mechanisms of deactivation might be involved. Besides coke deposition, the chemical properties of the Pt species might also change during the reaction process. For example, the Pt species could migrate and re-disperse under reaction conditions, which could be responsible for the deviated deactivated kinetics. Our previous study shows that the deactivated Pt100 catalyst can not be fully regenerated [39], which also supports the hypothesis of changing Pt metal functionality after the reaction. From the deactivation kinetics, the activities of propane to BTX beyond TOS of 16 h were calculated (dash lines in Fig. 3(b)). It is seen that the lifespan of Pt500 and Pt100 is about 100 h and 50 h, respectively. Through integration, the TONs of propane to BTX over the Pt500 and Pt100 are both around 0.3 million molpropane/molPt, however, the TON on the Pt50 is only 60 thousand molpropane/molPt, which is 1/5th of that over the Pt100 and Pt500 catalysts, demonstrating the same trend as ethane DHA. 3.2 Metal functionality and its deactivation for ethane/D2 exchange The steady-state catalytic results of ethane and propane DHA suggested the significant difference in metal functionality between the Pt50 and Pt≥100 catalysts. The temperature-programmed ethane/D2 isotopic was performed to show the influence of metal functionality on the initial C-H bond activation, which also demonstrated the significant structure sensitivity. Ethane/D2 exchange produces deuterium-exchanged ethane (C2HxD6−x), HD, and H2 through C2H6 + (3–0.5x) D2 → C2HxD6−x + (3–0.5x) H2 or C2H6 + (6-x) D2 → C2HxD6−x + (6-x) HD. As shown in Fig. 4, the activity of ethane/D2 exchange also depends highly on the Pt loading. The onset temperature for HD and H2 formation (Fig. 4(a)–(c)) increased from 150 °C to 220 and 250 °C with decreasing Pt loading from 500 ppm to 100 and 50 ppm, respectively. With increasing temperatures, the activity of HD and H2 formation increased and the reactor outlet flow of D2 decreased. The maximum rate of HD formation was observed at 269, 306, and 351 °C, respectively, over the Pt500, Pt100, and Pt50 catalysts. After that, the HD formation decreased and H2 continue to increase with increasing temperatures because the exchange incline to follow C2H6 + (3–0.5x) D2 → C2HxD6−x + (3–0.5x) H2 under the D2 deficient condition at high temperatures. Noteworthily, the activity of ethane/D2 exchange at temperatures below 400 °C mainly originated from the metal functionality, exchange over the pure HZSM-5 at such lower temperature is negligible (see Fig. S6). Although various deuterium-exchanged ethane, C2HxD6−x (x = 0–5), were produced during the Ethane/D2 exchange, the main product is C2H5D (m/z = 31). The formation of C2HxD6−x (x ≤ 4) is less significant under the employed conditions. Therefore, only the ratio of signal m/z = 31 to m/z = 30 was considered to demonstrate the formation of C2H5D over the different catalysts. As shown in Fig. 4(d), the formation of C2H5D follows the same trend as the rate of HD and H2. The onset temperature for C2H5D formation is 150, 220, and 250 °C, respectively, for the Pt500, Pt100, and Pt50 catalysts. Noteworthily, during the ethane/D2 exchange experiments, the catalyst loading for the Pt500, Pt100, and Pt50 catalysts was 20, 100, and 200 mg, respectively, namely, employing the same amount of Pt for the exchange. Therefore, the significant difference in isotopic exchange activity must be associated with the chemical properties of the Pt species, rather than the population of the catalytic active sites. Since the stability of the Pt/HZSM-5 catalyst is dependent highly upon the Pt loading, the metal functionality of the deactivated catalysts was also investigated based on the temperature-programmed ethane/D2 isotopic exchange. The formation of H2 and HD corresponds well to the formation of deuterium-exchanged ethane, therefore, only the ratio of I31/I30 was shown in Fig. 5 for the deactivated catalysts in contrast to the fresh catalysts and HZSM-5 as the reference. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the deactivated Pt500 catalyst (after ethane DHA for 17 h, see Fig. 1(a)) still shows a significant activity for ethane/D2 exchange, although the catalyst is totally inactive for ethane DHA, indicating the presence of active Pt species for ethane/D2 exchange in the deactivated Pt500 catalyst for ethane DHA. Quite similar to ethane DHA, the accelerated deactivation of the metal functionality for ethane/D2 exchange was also identified with decreasing Pt loading. For the Pt100 catalyst (Fig. 5(b)), significant deactivation was observed after ethane DHA for 2.5 and 5 h, significantly fast deactivation than the Pt500. Additionally, the activity of ethane/D2 exchange after ethane DHA reaction for 17 h is very similar to the pure HZSM-5, indicating total deactivation of the Pt sites. The deactivation of the metal functionality further accelerated after decreasing Pt loading to 50 ppm (Fig. 5(c)). Noteworthily, the totally deactivated Pt100 and Pt50 catalysts for ethane DHA, namely after reaction for 5 and 1 h, respectively (see Fig. 1(a)), also show sufficient activity for ethane/D2 exchange. Therefore, the same as the Pt500 catalyst, it suggests the presence of active Pt species (which could be the large Pt nanoparticle on the external surface of the zeolite, see Fig. 6) for ethane/D2 exchange although the catalyst is inactive for ethane DHA. 3.3 Discussion The catalytic results for ethane DHA and ethane/D2 exchange shown above demonstrated the significant influence of the Pt loading on stability. As will be discussed below, the deactivation of the catalysts for ethane DHA and ethane/D2 exchange must be associated with local coke deposition on the Pt clusters (with proximity to the proton) inside the zeolite channels. To identify coke deposition and its location on the Pt/HZSM-5 catalyst, the deactivated Pt500 and Pt100 catalysts (after ethane DHA for 17 and 5 h, respectively) were first characterized by the TEM. As shown in Fig. 6(b, c, e, and f), both catalysts, after total deactivation for ethane DHA, show the absence of carbon deposition on the external surface of the zeolite, indicating that coke deposition on the external surface of the catalysts is insignificant and is not the reason for deactivation. Nonetheless, coke might be generated inside the zeolite channel on the Pt clusters, which could significantly influence the accessibility of the reactant to the active Pt sites. According to TGA (under dry air up to 600 °C), coke deposition is around 0.94 %, 0.35 %, and 0.27 %, respectively, for the deactivated Pt500, Pt100, and Pt50 catalysts (see Fig. S7), which corresponds to the coke amount (assume coke is C) of 783.3, 291.7, and 225.0 μmol/gcat, respectively (see Table 1). Considering that the reaction time for total deactivation varies significantly with different Pt loading, the rate of coking (average rate until total deactivation) was evaluated to be 46.1, 58.3, and 225 μmol/gcat/h (Table 1). It is seen that Pt500 and Pt100 catalysts show almost the same rate of coking, which is significantly lower than that of Pt50. The lower average coking rate on Pt500 and Pt100 corresponds well to the higher TONs of ethane DHA shown in Fig. 1. As aforementioned, the total TONs of Pt50 is 1/4th of that of Pt100 and Pt500 catalysts. Noteworthily, although the identified amounts of coking seem negligible concerning the catalyst weight, the ratios of C to Pt are up to 305.7, 569.0, and 878.0, respectively, for the Pt500, Pt100, and Pt50 due to the lower Pt loading. Therefore, the identified coke amounts could significantly block the Pt clusters if coke deposition is mainly occurring on the Pt sites (will be further discussed below). We believe coke formation on the acid sites is negligible since pure HZSM-5 zeolite is almost inactive for ethane activation under the investigated conditions. The influence of coking on the surface area and pore volume is also compiled in Table 1 (the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of the different samples are shown in Fig. S8). It is seen that the specific surface area and pore volume slightly decreased depending on the total amounts of coking. The significantly different coking rates discussed above must be associated with the chemical properties of the Pt species. The TEM characterization of the fresh Pt500 and Pt100 catalysts are shown in Fig. 6(a) and (d), respectively. Although the TEM shows the presence of a few Pt nanoparticles (⁓ 2 nm) in the Pt500 catalyst, the nanoparticles were almost absent from the Pt100 sample. Therefore, the majority of the Pt species are forming small clusters inside the zeolite channels. Characterization of the Pt500 catalyst by X-ray absorption spectrometer (see Fig. S9 for XANES and EXAFS of Pt500 catalyst at Pt LIII-edge) suggests that the Pt species are different from the Pt foil. The white line of Pt500 is higher than the Pt foil, indicating that the Pt species are positively charged, Ptδ+. The k3-weighted Fourier transform of the EXAFS spectra shows scatterings of both Pt-Pt at R-distance between 2 and 3 Å and Pt-O at 1.55 Å [39]. By fitting the EXAFS spectra, the coordination number of Pt-O and Pt-Pt are around 1 and 6, respectively [39], and the average absorber-back-scatter distance of Pt-O and Pt-Pt are 2 and 2.64 Å, respectively. These results suggested the formation of Ptm clusters (m=6–7) inside the HZSM-5 zeolite rather than Pt nanoparticles on the external surface. Therefore, the nanoparticles on the external surface, identified by TEM, are negligible in contrast to the Pt clusters in the zeolite channels. Sintering of these external surface nanoparticles (forming sintered particles >10 nm) was observed after ethane DHA according to the TEM of the deactivated Pt500 sample (Fig. 6(b) and (c)). Nonetheless, we expect that the aggregation of the Ptm clusters inside the zeolite channels can be avoided due to the confinement effect. Considering that the TONs of Pt100 and Pt500 are almost identical, it might be expected that the size of the Ptm clusters in Pt100 and Pt500 is similar. The Ptm clusters inside the zeolite channels show close proximity with the Brønsted acid sites according to the proton/D2 exchange at room temperature [39], suggesting the formation of the [Ptm-Hn]n+ adduct anchored to the framework AlfO4-. The formation of [Ptm-Hn]n+ adduct was also suggested by Bao et al. based on the DFT calculations [52]. Due to the migration of proton onto the Ptm clusters, the [Ptm-Hn]n+ adducts are oxidized with the calculated Bader charges of + 0.50 to + 1.23 |e| [52]. While the Bader charges of the Ptm cluster increase with increasing cluster size, the average charge on each Pt atom decreases. However, according to Reschetilowski et al. [34], increased electron deficiency of the Pt clusters is not desired for DHA because it stabilizes the platinum-ethylene complex, leading to the formation of heavier oligomers (coke precursor) and accelerating catalyst deactivation. In the present study, we expect that the Ptm clusters size in the Pt500 and Pt100 samples are similar although direct evidence from the EXAFS remains challenging due to the lower Pt loading. According to Bao et al. [52], the stability of the [Ptm-Hn]n+ adduct increases with increasing cluster size, therefore, forming the optimized structure of the [Ptm-Hn]n+ adduct in both Pt500 and Pt100 catalysts. However, the cluster size of the [Ptm-Hn]n+ adduct could be smaller in the Pt50 sample due to the further decreased Pt loading; in other words, the formation of the optimized [Ptm-Hn]n+ adduct was limited due to the lack of Pt species at the nearby T12 and T8 sites (Pt species are well dispersed in the zeolite channels). Consequently, the [Ptm-Hn]n+ adduct in the Pt50 catalyst shows higher electron deficiency than that in the Pt500 and Pt100 catalysts, leading to accelerated coking rate and lower TON as discussed above. 4 Conclusions We investigated the influence of Pt loading (≤500 ppm) in the acidic HZSM-5 catalyst for ethane and propane DHA. Our results show that the catalytic performance of the Pt/HZSM-5 catalysts in DHA is dependent highly upon the Pt loading. The activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalyst decrease (due to the declined population of the Pt sites) with decreasing Pt loading from 500 to 100 ppm. Whereas, the intrinsic catalytic performance of the Pt500 and Pt100 catalysts is almost identical based on the TON, which represents the circles of conversion that can be realized on each Pt site before total deactivation. Specifically, the Pt500 and Pt100 catalysts show almost the same TONs of ethane to olefins (around 100,000) and BTX (around 70,000). However, the TONs of ethane to olefins and BTX over the Pt50 catalyst are 36,000 and 10,000, respectively, indicating that the intrinsic catalytic behavior of the active Pt species decreased with decreasing Pt loading to 50 ppm. Namely, the total TON of ethane converted to olefins and BTX over the Pt500 and Pt100 catalysts is about 4 times that over the Pt50 catalyst. A quite similar relationship on TON was also found in propane DHA. The declined TON over the Pt50 catalyst must be associated with the changes in the [Ptm-Hn]n+ adduct structure. We suggest that the formation of the optimized [Ptm-Hn]n+ adduct in Pt50 was limited due to the lack of Pt species at the nearby T12 and T8 sites. Decreasing the Pt cluster size in the [Ptm-Hn]n+ adduct will increase the average electron deficiency of each Pt atom, which will stabilize the platinum-ethylene complex, leading to the formation of heavier oligomers (coke precursor) and accelerate catalyst deactivation. Quitely surprisingly, the average rate of coking (per gram catalyst basis) quantified by TGA over Pt50 is significantly higher than that of Pt500 and Pt100, which corresponds well to the TON relations observed during both ethane and propane DHA. Therefore, to maximize the metal functionality of Pt species (in HZSM-5 zeolite) for light alkane DHA, the minimal Pt loading is somewhere between 50 and 100 ppm. Nonetheless, the low limit of Pt loading can be decreased by tuning the Pt cluster properties with a second metal as demonstrated in our recent study [39].

        "dc:description": "Understanding the influence of ppm level Pt loading on catalytic behavior is critical to the design of efficient catalysts with minimized Pt utilization. Here we investigate the influence of Pt loading (≤ 500 ppm) in HZSM-5 on the catalytic behavior of ethane and propane dehydroaromatization (DHA). We show that the activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalyst are highly dependent upon Pt loading. While 500 and 100 ppm catalysts show nearly the same turnover number (TON) in both ethane and propane DHA, the TON decreased and the average rate of coking (per gram catalyst basis) increased with decreasing Pt loading to 50 ppm. The 50 ppm Pt/HZSM-5 failed to form the optimized [Ptm-Hn]n+ adduct due to the limited Pt availability at the nearby T12 and T8 sites. Consequently, the minimum Pt loading is between 50 and 100 ppm for the maximized intrinsic metal functionality for light alkanes DHA over the monometallic Pt/HZSM-5 catalyst.",
