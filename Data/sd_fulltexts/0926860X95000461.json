Introduction Palladium, platinum and rhodium are known as widely used heterogeneous catalysts [ 1-10], but the catalytic application of ruthenium is limited to only some specific reactions, in which it holds, however, a firm position. Together with various other metals ruthenium might also be a suitable catalyst for hydrogenation of substituted anilines to cyclohexylamines, carboxylic acids to alcohols, allyl and heterocyclic aromatic compounds, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, etc. [ 11-27]. In general, aldehydes are readily hydrogenated to alcohols but ketones (being more sterically hindered) are more difficult to reduce [28]. In either case further reduction of the alcohol to the hydrocarbon is possible, although it usually does not occur when starting from an aliphatic carbonyl compound. Ruthenium is the most active catalyst for hydrogenation of aliphatic carbonyl compounds, particularly in the presence of some water [ 11 ]. Hydrogenation of c~,/3-unsaturated aldehydes to saturated aldehydes is readily achieved over most platinum metais [29]. The selec- tive synthesis of unsaturated alcohols is, however, much more difficult to achieve [ 30,31 ]. Platinum and ruthenium have been suggested for these reactions, in par- ticular the latter because of its lower price and comparable catalytic properties [ 32- 34]. Ruthenium is particularly active for the hydrogenation of aqueous sugar solutions to polyols (e.g. glucose to sorbitol) and it maintains its activity for a long period. High activity of the catalyst is a necessary condition. The purity specifications of products for food use, e.g. for sorbitol, allow only < 0.3% of glucose, thus 99.7% conversion must be achieved. Ruthenium is effective at lower pressure and tem- perature than nickel, which results in lower plant capital costs and fewer problems with caramelization. Furthermore, unlike nickel, ruthenium is not leached into the sugar solution, eliminating the expensive product purification stage [ 11,35-37]. Ruthenium catalysts have also been used for partial hydrogenation of benzene and toluene to cyclohexene and methylcyclohexene, respectively. Application of organic and inorganic modifiers may give rise to increased selectivity of the reac- tions to the cycloalkenes [34,38-41]. The rate of hydrogenation of the aromatic ring to the corresponding intermediate on ruthenium varies with the nature, number and position of the substituents [ 34,42-44]. In this review, the preparation of ruthenium catalysts and their physical and chemical characterizations are briefly mentioned first, then the role of ruthenium in selective hydrogenation of carbonyl groups is discussed, and finally ways of preparation of the cycloalkenes by partial hydrogenation of aromatics are given.

Preparation and characterization of ruthenium hydrogenation catalysts Ruthenium catalysts employed in hydrogenation reactions in both the gas and liquid phase are most often supported on alumina, silica, titania or active charcoal [45,46]. Other supports, especially more complicated alumino-silicates, polymer supports, catalysts in an ion-exchange form, etc., are rarely discussed [47,48]. Their current availability by companies producing catalysts is also limited [ 11,49]. Ruthenium (III) chloride and ruthenium (IV) oxide are referred to as the most often used active component precursors [ 45,50 ]. Practical utility of other precursors such as ruthenocene (dicyclopentadienylruthenium) [ 51 ], tris- (2,4-pentadionato)- ruthenium [ 52 ], trinitro-nitrosylruthenium [ 53 ], dodecacarbonylruthenium [ 12 ], etc. is somewhat limited. The problems usually encountered in the preparation, structure study and reaction performance of supported catalysts might, to a certain extent, be avoided by using ruthenium black [45,50,54]. Although its practical use is marginal, the major contribution of such a catalyst comes from an absence of SMSI [55-59] and other metal-support interactions [ 34,60,61 ]. The reduction of active component precur- sors to metallic ruthenium black is feasible either with hydrogen [50,54,62] at elevated temperature or by using chemical reduction agents [63-68]. Conventional impregnation [45,46,69,70] and the incipient wetness technique [71] are the methods reported most frequently for the preparation of supported ruthenium catalysts. The effectiveness of the preparation strongly depends on the course and the experimental arrangement of the reduction and/or calcination of the catalyst precursor, bearing in mind that especially chlorides and residual elements (also impurities) may drastically change the activity and selectivity of the final catalyst [ 34,46,47,54,69,71-73 ]. In view of an increased cyclohexene yield in benzene hydrogenation, the sol-gel method seems to have a potential for giving highly active and dispersed catalysts for this reaction [40,74]. It is a technique for transferring the uniformity of homo- geneous solutions containing various catalyst components to the solid state [ 75,76]. The ion-exchange approach has usually been chosen for preparation of ruthenium supported on zeolites [ 77 ]. In order to meet all requirements of activity and selectivity of the prepared catalysts, appropriate physical and chemical characterizations are becoming impor- tant [ 78 ]. The surface area, pore size and particle size distribution, metal dispersion, crystallinity, composition of the support, reducibility of the precursors, SMSI, hydrogen spillover, traces of elements with modification effects, etc., are factors governing the performance of the catalysts [78]. Selectivity and activity of ruthe- nium catalysts are known to be very sensitive to such factors [78,79]. The preparation of ruthenium catalysts and their physical and chemical properties are discussed elsewhere in detail [78,79]. 16 P. Kluson, L. Cerveny /Applied Catalysis A: General 128 (1995) 13-31 3. Hydrogenation of a C=O group over ruthenium catalysts Selective catalytic hydrogenation of a carbonyl group in the vicinity of either a double bond (either isolated or conjugated) or an aromatic ring is a unique problem usually solved by making use of platinum or ruthenium catalysts [9,30-34,46,80]. Selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols is an important step in preparing various fine chemicals useful in pharmacology, perfume and food processing industries, etc. [ 81-84]. The effectiveness of both metals in such transformations can be enhanced by combining them with other metals, with suitable catalyst modifiers or by using various supports [31,59,85-87]. Geometric effects of adsorbed species, particle size, SMSI and some other factors may further increase the selectivity of the reaction toward unsaturated alcohols [ 29 ]. The availability of less expensive ruthenium with competitive properties caused platinum to be virtually abandoned for such reactions. 3.1. Effects of supports Experiments with Ru/SiO2 and Ru/TiQ catalysts show that the latter always exhibits [34,88] an improved activity and selectivity towards C=O double bond hydrogenation (Table 1 ). Whereas Ru/SiO2 selectively hydrogenates cyclohexene in an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene and cyclohexanone, Ru/TiO2 hydrogenates both compounds at equal rates [88]. An enhanced selectivity towards the carbonyl group with respect to the hydro- genation of an aromatic ring has also been studied. Hydrogenation of acetophenone proceeds in a stepwise manner [ 34,46,88] with two alternative reaction pathways (Fig. 1 ). The final product of the reaction is 1-cyclohexylethanol regardless of the type of a catalyst. Yields of 18% and of 50% of 1-phenylethanol are attained on Ru/SiO2 and on Ru/TiO2 catalysts, respectively [ 88]. Formation [34,40] of ethyl- Table 1 Activating influence of TiO2 support on ruthenium catalyzed hydrogenation reactions in liquid phase ( 101 kPa, 303 K) [881 Substrate Initial activity [ 10 3 mol H2 (mol Ru s) - ~ ] 5% Ru/SiO2 1% Ru/TiO2 Acetone 2.4 150 Cyclohexanone 1.0 75 4-t-Butylcyclohexanone 0.12 175 2-Butenal 1.4 10.8 Acetophenone 1.1 3.7 D-Fructose 0.6 48.2 Cyclohexene 142 249 P.

Reaction scheme of hydrogenation of acetophenone on ruthenium catalysts [46]. benzene (consequently of ethylcyclohexane) is marginal on ruthenium catalysts (Fig. 1 ). Active components of the catalysts supported on titania may not necessarily possess the sites suitable for giving rise to unsaturated alcohols. To a certain extent this depends [86] on the temperature of the reduction of the catalytic precursor (low-temperature reduction LTR, high-temperature reduction HTR) as is shown in Table 2. The metal particles of a catalyst with lower dispersion (HTR treatment) are decorated with titania sub-oxides generating new stable active sites for selective carbonyl group hydrogenation [ 86]. In the case of ruthenium supported on titania, its performance in crotonaldehyde hydrogenation does not depend on the course of the catalyst precursor reduction in such a serious way as when using rhodium, osmium or iridium (Table 2). The occurrence of increased selectivity to unsaturated alcohols in hydrogenation of a,/3-unsaturated aldehydes (e.g. cinnamaldehyde, 3-methyl-2-butenal) is also reported [ 29] over ruthenium supported on zeolites. The pore structure of the zeolites leads to higher selectivity to the unsaturated alcohol in cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation, where steric constraints of the reactant prevent adsorption at the C=C bond on the metal sites within the pores. In the case of 3-methyl-2-butenal the mobility and orientation of the molecule is not inhibited by the zeolite pores.

Nevertheless, the selectivity to 2-butenol could be increased by replacing Na+ compensating cations with K+ cations in the support. This modification brings about a decrease in the C=C bond hydrogenation attributed to the enhanced metal electron density combined with an increase in the C=O bond hydrogenation due to an interaction between the carbonyl function and the more basic zeolite cation. By contrast, when using the inert active carbon support the selectivity to the required unsaturated intermediate is very low, since the charcoal imposes no geometric or electronic constraints on the reaction of both substrates [ 29]. 3.2. Steric effects Apart from the effect of the catalytic support, changes in selectivity might also be attributed to steric effects. This is demonstrated [89] by using substrates having two carbonyl groups in their molecules (e.g. methylcyclohexane-1,4-dione with C=O groups in o~ and 3 positions) or ketones substituted with other groups in various positions with respect to the C=O group (e.g. 2-, or 3-methylcyclohexan- ones). The position of the carbonyl groups in diketones and variation of the structure of cyclohexanone derivatives affect the sequence of the activity of the catalysts tested (Table 3). Based on the relative reactivities, similar properties of ruthenium and osmium are reported. Both metals reveal increased activity to the 3 carbonyl group hydrogenation in a diketone molecule and to preferential hydrogenation of 3-methylcyclohexanone to the corresponding alcohol [89]. All the methyl-substi- tuted ketones are, however, less reactive than cyclohexanone [90] on the catalysts used. Because the carbonyl groups of the substituted and unsubstituted ketones are nearly identical in charge distribution and in bond order [ 90 ], the methyl substituent effect upon hydrogenation rate is primarily due to the steric hindrance to adsorption. 3.3. Particle size effects When attempting to obtain high yields of unsaturated alcohols without using a specific support (e.g. titania), the particle size and morphology of the catalyst may also affect the selectivity of the reaction. P. Kluson, L. Cerveny /Applied Catalysis A: General 128 (1995) 13 31 19 H H cinnamyl alcohol Fig. 2. Reaction scheme of hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde on ruthenium catalysts [97]. The reactions of cinnamaldehyde and citral offer a possibility of hydrogenation of an aldehyde group, a conjugated C--C double bond, an aromatic ring and of an aldehyde group, a conjugated C=C double bond, an isolated C=C double bond, respectively [91,92]. To avoid metal-support interactions active charcoal is employed as a support that imposes no geometric or electronic constraints on the reaction. Under the usual reaction conditions (Ru/C catalyst, metal loading 0.5-10%), both the carbonyl C--O group and the C--C double bond of cinnamaldehyde are hydrogenated (Fig. 2) to form the main product, 3-phenyl-1-propanol. The trans- formation proceeds via two routes with parallel formation of hydrocinnamaidehyde and cinnamyl alcohol. It has been found that catalysts having larger ruthenium particles (ca. 10-11 nm) are more selective toward the unsaturated alcohol. An explanation is given in terms of the steric effects of the aromatic ring [34,91,92]. On the larger particles the aromatic ring is not adsorbed on the surface and the presence of an energy barrier prevents a closer approach. The cinnamaldehyde molecule is tilted and the C=O group is closer to the surface than the C=C bond. Thus, it can be expected that on the flat planes the C=O group is more easily activated [91,92]. During the hydrogenation of citral and up to a citral conversion of about 90% the main reaction products over the Ru/C are geraniol, nerol, citronellal, citronelloi and isopulegol (Fig. 3). It is noteworthy that the isolated C--C bond is usually not reduced and the final product of the reaction is citronellol. Typically the selectivity to a,/3-unsaturated alcohols (geraniol, nerol) is nearly constant over a wide range of conversions. Hydrogenation of geraniol or nerol takes place only after citral has almost disappeared from the reaction mixture. This indicates that hydrogenation of the C=C double bond of both unsaturated alcohols is inhibited by strong adsorption of the carbonyl group on the ruthenium surface [91,92]. In citral hydrogenation the rate of the reaction and the product distribution (selectivity to geraniol and nerol) are independent of the particle size (range 3-7 nm). Due to the absence of an aromatic ring in the molecule, steric effects scarcely influence the reaction with an increasing metal particle size [ 91,92 ] as was observed in cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation. 3.4. Effects of promoters The C=O bond is always less easily hydrogenated than the isolated C=C bond. Conjugated C=C bonds are less reactive and nearer in their activity to C=O bonds 20 P. Kluson, L.

The best promoters of ruthenium for such purposes are ions of gallium, germanium, tin, iron, titanium, alkali metals and similar cations [32,33,46,87,93]. The higher the ratio promoter/ruthenium is, the lower is the number of exposed ruthenium surface atoms. This indicates a poisoning effect of the promoter, which occurs through physical blocking of the ruthenium metal sites and through the formation of ruthenium-promoter alloys. On the other hand, new active sites with a promoter in higher oxidation states suitable for preferential hydrogenation of a carbonyl group of unsaturated aldehydes are formed. The promoters are present as the surface electron-acceptor species acting as adsorp- tion sites coordinating the oxygen atom of the substrate [34,46,93 ]. The potential promoting effect may also arise from impurities of the active component precursor or from traces of elements in catalytic supports [46]. Some of the ions usually identified in the catalytic supports, may upon drying and reduc- tion steps concentrate on the ruthenium active sites and act as promoters [46]. In 3-methyl-2-butenal hydrogenation the presence of alkali promoters (Na, K, Cs) in supported ruthenium catalysts (Ru/SiO2, Ru/zeolite) leads to an increased production of the corresponding unsaturated alcohol. This fact is due to higher polarization of the adsorbed substrate either through electronic interactions between the alkali species and the ruthenium particles or by direct interactions between the alkali species and the adsorbate [ 33]. P. Kluson, L. Cerveny /Applied Catalysis A: General 128 (1995) 13 31 21 3.5. Effects of bimetallic catalysts The high selectivity for unsaturated alcohols might also be arranged by making use of bimetallic catalysts. Some of the reported [84,87,94,95] ruthenium contain- ing bimetallic catalysts used in these reactions are Ru-Sn/support, Ru-Fe/support, Ru-Pt/support, etc. These catalysts are prepared by coimpregnation of a support by metal salts and subsequent reduction of the catalytic precursor by hydrogen [841. In the Ru-Sn/support catalyst [64,87], ruthenium is present as Ruin the Ru- Sn system, while tin exists in three oxidation states (predominantly Sn2 + and Sn4 +, some Sn. It is believed that there are two types of active sites on the Ru-Sn surface [64]. The first type is based on interaction of Ruwith Sn=O in Sn2+ and Sn4+ oxidation states. The existence of such sites could explain the increase in dispersion of ruthenium upon addition of tin. This effect is due to a spacer role of SnO between Rusites. The less abundant Snoxidation state is associated with the second type of active sites [64,96], with definite evidence of forming an alloy (Ru3-Sn7). The role played by tin in the catalytic activity of ruthenium also depends on the nature of the substrate. In the case of non-polar groups such as C=C double bonds the main effect of tin is that of decreasing the number of ruthenium surface atoms, the reactivity of which remains constant [97,98]. In other words tin activates the C=O group, facilitating the hydrogen transfer from adjacent ruthenium sites [97,98]. The activating effect of tin can be ascribed to Sn ions present on the catalytic surface which polarize the carbonyl group. In hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde and citral the use of a Ru-Sn/C catalyst increases the selectivity to cinnamyl alcohol and geraniol + nerol, respectively. In the case of citral the selectivity is increased from a value of 35% on Ru/C to a value of 80% on Ru + Sn/C with a corresponding decrease in the selectivity to products obtained by hydrogenation of the conjugated C=C double bond [98]. 4. Selective hydrogenation of aromatic substrates over ruthenium catalysts 4.1. General aspects Hydrogenations of benzene, toluene, etc., to corresponding cycloalkenes over ruthenium catalysts have attracted the attention of many research groups [39,41,46,68,70,71,76]. Hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane with formation of intermediates (cyclohexadienes, cyclohexene) is a valuable model reaction. Cyclohexene and its derivatives prepared in this way are also compounds of great industrial interest [ 1,28,40,79]. Cyclohexene is a raw material for production of cyclohexanone [ 1,40]. Because, unlike cyclohexane, cyclohexene does not form an azeotropic mixture with benzene, an expensive separation step is avoided that 22 P. Kluson, L. Cerveny /Applied Catalysis A: General 128 (1995) 13-31 is customary in the manufacture of cyclohexene by dehydrogenation of cyclohex- ane. Cyclohexane, a side product of the reaction, is returned to the inlet stream and dehydrogenated directly to benzene [ 99-102 ]. Under usual conditions there is a strong tendency of the reaction to proceed to cyclohexane in one step. It has been shown that either modified ruthenium catalysts prepared in a standard way (impregnation, ion exchange, etc.) or ruthenium without modifiers prepared by the sol-gel method may give rise to increased selectivity of the reaction to cyclohexene [40,46,67,71]. Besides ruthenium, the cycloalkenes have been obtained over a pentaamino-osmium catalytic complex [ 103 ], on various hydrides [ 104] of the early transition metals (ZrH2, HfH~, Till2, NbH, LaH3 UH3) and over Me/Z [ 105-107] type catalysts (Me =Pd, Pt, Rh; Z = polyacrylonitrile, Nylon-6, Nylon-3, poly-p-phenyleneterephtalamide, polyacrylamide, etc.). Prac- tical utility of such catalysts is, however, rather limited. Catalytic hydrogenation of benzene over ruthenium is carried out either in gas or liquid phase over a wide range of experimental conditions. It proceeds in agree- ment with the associative mechanism proposed by Horiuti and Polanyi with for- mation of adsorbed half-hydrogenated states and with desorption of cyclohexene and scarcely cyclohexadienes to the bulk phase [ 108-110]. Desorption of the 7r-complexed surface adsorbed species depends on a number of factors. Generally, desorption of cyclohexene is much easier to achieve than desorption of cyclohexadiene [ 108]. The latter has a structure which basically, when adsorbed, involves the loss of resonance, and is therefore considered to be very unstable [108]. On the other hand it has been proved that cyclohexadienes can be obtained from benzene by action of metallic sodium in the presence of liquid ammonia and of ethanol [ 111 ], or by using a combination of a large excess of an alcoholic (C ~-C~) solvent (molar ratio benzene / alcohol ~ 1 / 120) and an excess of free ruthenium surface sites of highly dispersed catalysts [46]. Some authors have reported that benzene hydrogenation proceeds via two inde- pendent parallel routes. The first one is a consecutive mechanism with the formation of cycloalkenes, the second one directly yields cyclohexane from benzene [39,41,46,68]. In separate experiments with competitive hydrogenation of an equimolar mixture of ~4C labelled benzene and unlabelled 1,3-cyclohexadiene was found that the radioactivity level measured in the cyclohexene fraction was lower than that in cyclohexane product fraction. These results support the existence of two parallel reaction pathways [ 112,113 ]. On the other hand, the explanation of these findings might also be drawn in terms of strong surface adsorption of 1,3-cyclohexadiene, as a result of which the surface coverage with benzene is considerably lowered [ 71 ]. Starting from this high cyclohexene coverage, both benzene and the benzene/ cyclohexane mixture are formed, at a rate that is about a hundred times as high as the hydrogenation rate of benzene [ 71,114,115 ]. Under certain conditions more cyclohexene than cyclohexane is formed from cyclohexadiene. Therefore, the dif- ference between the radioactivity in the product and the intermediate fractions can P. Kluson, L. Cerveny /Applied Catalysis A: General 128 (1995) 13-31 23 alternatively be explained without introducing a direct hydrogenation step [71,114,115]. The rate of hydrogenation of derivatives of benzene varies with the nature, number and position of the substituents [34,42-44]. The ratio Kxm of the adsorp- tion coefficients of toluene and benzene, determined from a kinetic analysis of the competitive hydrogenation of these hydrocarbons showed that toluene is more strongly adsorbed on the ruthenium surface than benzene. K-era is very large on ruthenium, about 9-10 on rhodium and about 1 on palladium. This is interpreted as an effect of a considerable electron transfer from toluene to the metal [31,34,42,116]. Large KTm ratios are associated with the electron-deficient char- acter of ruthenium. Depending upon the acidity of the support or upon the presence of electron acceptor coadsorbates like sulphur or when the surface metal atoms are interacting with the acidic sites of supports, Kxm increases further. On the other hand it decreases in the presence of electron-donor adsorbates or supports such as alkali or easily oxidizable metals like molybdenum or iron. This is attributed to the substituent effect of the methyl group which makes toluene more of an electron donor than benzene [ 31,42,116 ]. 4.2. Action of inorganic and organic modifiers and of catalysts prepared by the sol-gel method As early as 1963 ruthenium was reported as a suitable catalyst for preparation of cycloalkenes. Hartog and Zwietering hydrogenated benzene in the liquid phase at room temperature and atmospheric pressure in the presence of C~-C5 aliphatic alcohols (5-50%) yielding 2.2% of cyclohexene [ 117]. The first industrial patents suggested cyclohexene yields of 32 mol-% using ruthenium as a catalyst and by conducting the hydrogenation in an aqueous phase [ 118-120]. Addition of various species were shown to increase the yield of cyclohexene further. Since that time a good deal of work has been done, and presently application of either organic or inorganic modifiers may give rise to high cyclohexene yields [ 121 ]. 4.3. Inorganic modifiers Inorganic modifiers, accidentally introduced to the hydrogenation of benzene on ruthenium as metallic components of corroded reactor walls, change the pathway of the reaction toward increased selectivity to cyclohexene [ 39 ]. The problem remaining was to identify what elements were responsible for the change of the selectivity. Generally, nickel, chromium, manganese, iron, copper, cobalt, lead, etc., could be present in the stainless steel reactor walls or the agitating system. Their participation can be proved by separate addition to the reaction mixture by using an autoclave with polytetrafluoroethylene coated inner parts [ 39 ]. In this experimental arrangement, cobalt-modified ruthenium catalyst supported on calcium hydroxide gives the highest yield of cyclohexene, 20.3% at 58% conver- 24 P. Kluson, L. Cerveny /Applied Catalysis A: General 128 (1995) 13-31 sion. The initial selectivity with a nickel and iron modified catalyst is slightly higher, but the cyclohexene concentration peaks at lower level [39] and the cata- lysts are less active. A ruthenium catalyst prepared by reduction of ruthenium hydroxide (NaOH+ RuC13) is suspended in an aqueous phase with benzene and hydrogen dispersed in the form of droplets and bubbles [41,68,122-124]. The poisoning species tested are metallic iron, ferrous hydroxide or ferrite ions. For the chemical composition of an iron modified catalyst, the formation of Fe-Ru alloy is indicated (XRD, ESCA). Participation of iron on the Fe-Ru alloy is estimated to be around 30% and the rest is most likely present as X-ray amorphous iron oxides [68,125]. The high selectivity for cyclohexene could be straightforwardly explained if the poisonous species blocks the surface in such a way that the remaining active sites are left as doublets [ 123,125 ]. This arrangement requires one ruthenium atom, to which benzene is 7r-bonded. A hydrogen atom adsorbed at the other ruthenium atom in a doublet can thus only be added to carbon atoms at a bond conjugated to the bond involved in the 7r-complex. This means that when cyclohexene is 7r- bonded to the surface its double bond is no longer accessible to an adsorbed hydrogen atom and will thus not undergo further hydrogenation. When the extent of poisoning is so high that only single ruthenium atoms remain on the surface, the hydrogenation activity also decreases [123]. These geometric effects, together with a weaker adsorption of hydrocarbon species, could explain the high selectivity of the iron modified catalyst for cyclohexene [ 124] in benzene hydrogenation. Reactions carried out on unsupported ruthenium catalysts modified with zinc sulphate and / or with compounds ( oxides, hydroxides, hydrides) of other elements (iron, cobalt, aluminium, gallium, silicon, titanium, zirconium, hafnium, etc. ) give a cyclohexene yield of the order of 50% at a benzene conversion of almost 70%. The role of zinc compounds is interpreted as a stabilization of the intermediate and suppression of further hydrogenation. Ions of other elements probably prevent the agglomeration of the catalyst particles and their adhesion to the metallic surface of the reactor walls [ 121,126]. 4.4. Inorganic modifiers and mass transport considerations Due to the chemisorption of specific ions on the ruthenium surface, the originally hydrophobic particles become hydrophillic. In the presence of water this results in the formation of a stagnant water layer around the particles and the mass transport resistance may affect the reaction selectivity [ 127]. The search for suitable modifiers is based on their primary function to change the hydrophobicity of the ruthenium particles to hydrophilicity [ 127 ]. Usually ions of zinc, iron, cobalt, nickel, cadmium, gallium, indium, etc., are reported as efficient modifiers of ruthenium. The strong surface adsorbability on ruthenium active sites and absence of reduction to the corresponding metals are also inevitable conditions for reaching a high yield of cyclohexene. P. Kluson, L. Cerveny /Applied Catalysis A: General 128 (1995) 13-31 25 The optimum amount of additives used should be experimentally verified. The salt concentration in water has to be chosen in such a way that the equilibrium salt coverage is not too high, otherwise the number of remaining free ruthenium sites becomes too low. Typically, a continuing deposition of iron (e.g. corrosion) on the ruthenium surface finally leads to a total screening of all sites and loss of activity [127]. Hydrogenation of benzene performed in a batch reactor (423 K, 5.0 MPa) over a ruthenium catalyst modified with ZnS in a presence of some water gives a high yield of cyclohexene. In the first stage of the reaction the liquid/solid transport of hydrogen is the rate determining step. Due to this fact, only the outer surface of the catalyst is effectively used, whereas the reaction in pores of the catalyst is negligible. The extent of the external mass transfer limitation of benzene gradually increases due to its diminishing concentration with the progress of the reaction. Because of the low solubility of cyclohexene in water [121], its diffusion rate through the water film, which is proportional to the cyclohexene concentration in water, is extremely low. On the other hand, the rate of cyclohexene surface formation is much higher. Cyclohexene forms small drops in the stagnant water layer as soon as it desorbs. These drops are transferred to the bulk organic phase, where they immediately coalesce with large benzene-rich drops [ 121,127]. Up to the point where the maximum cyclohexene yield is reached, its concentra- tion gradient is directed from the catalyst to the organic phase. The diffusion rate of cyclohexane is even lower than that of cyclohexene, also due to its poor solubility in water. Therefore, the small drops formed in the water layer just above the catalyst surface contain both cyclohexene and cyclohexane. As the reaction proceeds, the concentration of benzene in water decreases. At a certain point, the mass transfer rate of benzene becomes the rate determining step and the rate of cyclohexene formation decreases. Furthermore, the hydrogen coverage of the catalyst increases as hydrogen mass transport is no longer the rate determining step. It results in a lower selectivity to cyclohexene and higher probability of reaction inside the pores [121,127]. The new stage is approached when the cyclohexene concentration gradient, which up to now has been directed from the catalyst to the organic phase, is reversed. This means that the maximum cyclohexene yield has already been reached, and now it is gradually converted to cyclohexane [ 121 ]. 4.5. Organic modifiers Organic modifiers may affect the yield of cyclohexene in reactions carried out either in gas or liquid phase. Due to its strong surface adsorption, E-caprolactam (H~d~= --73.5 kJ/mol) is often used [128] for such purposes. On the lactam-covered catalyst the initial selectivity of 27% to cyclohexene is rapidly attained. As a result of competitive benzene surface adsorption up to the steady state, the e-caprolactam coverage 26 P. Kluson. L. Cerveny ~Applied Catalysis A: General 128 (1995) 13-31 decreases. In order to improve the selectivity of the reaction the catalytic surface is usually precovered with the modifier. It is achieved by means of catalyst pretreat- ment in a hydrogen stream saturated with e-caprolactam [67,128]. Apparently the preadsorbed lactam causes stabilization of the catalyst. In the presence of glycol in the inlet stream, benzene is converted to cyclohexene with a selectivity of 40% [ 128]. Modification effects of C~-C5 aliphatic alcohols, especially in the liquid phase [34,46,129], are comparable with those of glycol and e-caprolactam in the gas phase [ 128]. A positive effect of alkanes (n-hexane, n-decane) on selectivity of the reaction to cyclohexene was not found [ 128,129]. These facts indicate that effective organic modifiers should contain a polar group. Based on IR and FT-IR studies [ 130,131 ] of the bonding between the modifier and cyclohexene, the formation of adsorbate-adsorbate interactions seems to be possible. Remembering the low enthalpy of cyclohexene adsorption on ruthenium (about - 26.5 kJ/mol at low coverage), the competition between the direct bonding of cyclohexene to the ruthenium surface and the formation of a hydrogen bonded adduct which is also bonded to the surface likely takes place [ 131 ]. Because of the formation of adducts, the overlap of the ~--electrons of the cyclohexene double bond with ruthenium d-orbitals is diminished. Further, the bonding between the modifier and cyclohexene is weak (enthalpy of hydrogen bonding is -3 kJ/mol to -5 kJ/mol), which means the hydrogen-bonded cyclohexene molecules can desorb at a higher rate than the cyclohexene molecules bonded directly to the surface can [131]. It is also possible that the cyclohexene molecules migrate over the surface to arrive via spillover on the modifier-covered part. In this way 'escape holes' are created through which cyclohexene can desorb without having a chance to undergo further hydrogenation [ 131 ]. 4.6. Catalysts prepared by sol-gel method The chemical mixing procedure (sol-gel method) used in the preparation of supported ruthenium catalysts is a technique for transferring the uniformity of homogeneous solutions containing various catalyst components to the solid state [132,133]. A description of the sol-gel procedure is given elsewhere in detail [40,76,79,132-137]. Such catalysts (without the presence of any modifiers under usual hydrogenation conditions) are able to convert benzene to cyclohexene with high selectivity [ 134]. The method ensures an intimate mixing of the ruthenium particles and the support [121]. Usually very small ruthenium crystallites [40,61,76,121 ] are incorporated in the support giving an extremely high surface area (up to 850 m2/g) and narrow micropores (dpore < 2 nm). Generally, if all components of the catalysts prepared by chemical mixing are completely mixed with each other, it is difficult for them to aggregate and crystal- P. Kluson, L.

The diols (prepa- ration solvents) which are incorporated in the polymer structure [40] of the catalyst precursor before reduction (Fig. 4) also help to prevent active components of the catalyst from aggregating [75]. They serve as bridging ligands between sites and the support, suppressing the formation of cyclohexane by reducing the hydrogen adsorption capacity of ruthenium through coordination of the hydroxy groups [69]. Ruthenium is known [ 135,136] to be easily coordinated to H20 or OH groups. In sol-gel catalysts this bonding is favoured because the metal is in contact with such species even before the gelation point [40,74,75,135,136]. When catalysts prepared by chemical mixing are used, the presence of water in the reaction mixture is essential. The role of water is to expel cyclohexene formed on the catalyst surface by competitive adsorption with cyclohexene [40,74]. The high cyclohexene yields might also be realized by making use of ruthenium supported on hydrophillic porous oxides like silica and alumina [121]. It seems that hydrophilicity of the support together with its close contact with active sites may affect the selectivity of the reaction in an analogous way as when using modifiers that change the hydrophobicity of ruthenium. Most likely the hydrophillic support prepared by the sol-gel method also causes the formation of a stagnant water layer resulting in a suppression of the reaction rate and in an increase of the selectivity [ 121 ]. 5. Conclusion Specific properties of the ruthenium catalysts in hydrogenation reactions have been reviewed. It has been shown that ruthenium exhibits an increased selectivity toward hydrogenation of a carbonyl group in the vicinity of a C=C double bond (either isolated or conjugated) or an aromatic ring. The selectivity might be further enhanced by using various supports, modifiers of the catalysts, bimetallic catalysts, etc. 28 P. Kluson, L. Cerveny /Applied Catalysis A.\" General 128 (1995) 13-31 Ruthenium is also selective for partial hydrogenation of an aromatic ring to corresponding cycloalkenes in the presence of either organic or inorganic modifiers. It was shown that catalysts prepared by chemical mixing (sol-gel method) are highly active and selective for these reactions even without the presence of the modifiers.

All rights reserved Selective hydrogenation over ruthenium catalysts Petr Kluson Libor Cerveny * Institute of Chemical Technology — ICT Prague, Department of Organic Technology, Technická5, 166 28 Prague 6, Czech Republic * Corresponding author. Ruthenium catalysts are widely used for selective hydrogenation of a carbonyl group in the vicinity of conjugated or isolated double bonds. The α,β-unsaturated alcohols prepared in this way are compounds of great commercial importance. The effects of promoters, particle size and supports on such reactions are discussed. Ruthenium catalysts have also been applied in partial hydrogenation of aromatic compounds to the corresponding cycloalkenes. The effects of inorganic and organic modifiers on the course of the reactions together with a description of the action of catalysts prepared by the sol-gel method are given.

        "dc:description": "Ruthenium catalysts are widely used for selective hydrogenation of a carbonyl group in the vicinity of conjugated or isolated double bonds. The α,β-unsaturated alcohols prepared in this way are compounds of great commercial importance. The effects of promoters, particle size and supports on such reactions are discussed. Ruthenium catalysts have also been applied in partial hydrogenation of aromatic compounds to the corresponding cycloalkenes. The effects of inorganic and organic modifiers on the course of the reactions together with a description of the action of catalysts prepared by the sol-gel method are given.",
