DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(10)60247-1 Cerium Oxide Promoted Ni/MgO Catalyst for the Synthesis of Multi-walled Carbon Nanotubes YANG Wen, CHU Wei , JIANG Chengfa*, WEN Jie, SUN Wenjing Department of Chemical Engineer, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610065, Sichuan, China Abstract: Ni/MgO, Ni/CeO 2 -MgO, and Ni/CeO 2 catalysts were prepared by the citric acid combustion method. Their catalytic properties for the synthesis of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) by chemical vapor deposition using CH 4 as carbon source were evaluated. The catalysts were characterized with N 2 adsorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), H 2 temperature-programmed reduction (H 2 -TPR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The quality and structure of the CNTs were characterized by thermogravimetry (TG) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). H 2 -TPR showed that CeO 2 helped decrease the reduction temperature and increase the content of an easily reducible Ni species. XPS showed an energy shift of the Ni catalyst that was modified by CeO 2 . XRD showed that the reduced nickel maintained their small particle sizes in the Ni/CeO 2 -MgO catalysts. These findings suggested that the addition of CeO 2 changed the chemical environment of the nickel species, which resulted in a weaker interaction between the nickel and the support and increased the reducibility of the Ni species. Moreover, the reduced nickel was highly dispersed on the CeO 2 -MgO support. The change enhanced the catalytic activity for the growth of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Characterization by TG and TEM showed that the quality of the CNTs grown on Ni/CeO 2 -MgO was better than those grown on Ni/MgO catalyst. Key words: nickel; magnesium oxide; cerium oxide; chemical vapor deposition method; carbon nanotubes; methane decomposition Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted significant re- search interest since their discovery by Ijiwa in 1991 [1]. CNTs have remarkable properties that make them suitable for a wide range of applications as chemical sensors [2], composite ma- terials [3], electronic devices and so on. There are three tech- niques commonly used to grow CNTs, namely, arc discharge, laser ablation, and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Among these, CVD is the most convenient way to grow all kinds of CNTs and the best choice to produce large amount of CNTs at relatively low cost and with mild growth conditions. The carbon sources used include CH 4 [4], C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 2 [5], CO [6], ethanol [7] and so on, and is also one of main factors influencing the quality of the CNTs. Among the hydrocarbons, methane as the carbon source produce less impurity in the synthesized CNTs because it is difficult to decompose it in the gas phase and on the support. In the CVD synthesis of CNTs, Fe, Co, Ni, and their alloys [8] supported on oxides such as Al 2 O 3 , SiO 2 , and MgO [9] are used as the catalyst. MgO is considered a good support for the catalyst from the viewpoint of convenience and cost to purify the CNT product since MgO can be easily dissolved in dilute HCl solution. A rare earth component Ce in a Ni or Fe catalyst played an important role in the synthesis of single-walled carbon nano- tubes using arc discharge [10,11] and the CVD method [12]. The addition of Ce prevented the sintering of Ni particles during reduction and maintained its distribution, which pro- moted the stability of the Ni catalyst [13]. Gueara et al. [14] found that Ni on a high surface area Ce-MCM-41 support showed excellent activity for methane decomposition. In this work, Ni/CeO 2 -MgO catalysts were prepared using the citric acid combustion method and used to synthesize CNTs by the CVD method using methane as the carbon source. The catalysts and CNTs were characterized by H 2 temperature- programmed reduction (H 2 -TPR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission elec- YANG Wen et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1323â€“1328 tron microscopy (TEM), and thermogravimetry (TG). The results showed that the Ni/CeO 2 -MgO catalyst had good cata- lytic activity for the decomposition of methane to synthesize CNTs. 1 Experimental 1.1 Preparation of the catalysts The catalyst precursors for Ni/CeO 2 -MgO were prepared by the citric acid combustion method. Ni(NO 3 ) 3 Â·6H 2 O, Ce(NO 3 ) 3 Â·6H 2 O, and Mg(NO 3 ) 2 Â·6H 2 O were mixed in a citric acid aqueous solution that was stirred and gelated at 70 Â°C. After drying at 120 Â°C overnight, the dried gel was calcined at 600 Â°C for 2 h in air to get the Ni/CeO 2 -MgO catalyst. The loading of Ni on the catalysts was kept at 50 wt%. The contents of CeO 2 were 0%, 20%, 40%, and 50% for four different catalysts, and the remaining component was MgO. For exam- ple, the Ni/20CeO 2 -MgO catalyst had the weight ratio of Ni:CeO 2 :MgO of 50:20:30. For comparison, Ni/MgO and Ni/CeO 2 were also prepared by the same method. 1.2 Characterization of catalyst and carbon nanotubes The specific surface areas of the catalysts were determined by N 2 adsorption at â€“196 Â°C on a Quatachrome Nova 1000e apparatus. H 2 -TPR measurements were carried out at atmos- pheric pressure with a fixed bed reactor. The sample (50 mg) was loaded and the reduction gas of 5%H 2 -95%N 2 was intro- duced at a flow rate of 30 ml/min. The temperature of the reactor was increased linearly at a rate of 5 Â°C/min from 50 to 850 Â°C and kept for 30 min at 850 Â°C. The effluent stream was analyzed for hydrogen by a thermal conductivity detector. Phase analysis was performed by XRD using a D/MAX-2500 (Rigaku Company) diffractometer with Cu K Ä® (Èœ = 0.154056 nm) radiation. Data for the Bragg angle from 10Â° to 90Â° were collected. XPS experiments were performed on an XSAM800 spectrometer with an Al anode for K Ä® (hÈž = 1486.6 eV) radia- tion. Charging effects were corrected by adjusting the binding energies using the C 1s peak from carbon contamination at 284.6 eV. TG experiments were carried out under flowing air with a heating rate of 15 Â°C/min. TEM images were taken with a Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. 1.3 Synthesis of carbon nanotubes To grow CNTs, 0.03 g of catalyst powder was dispersed on each of three boats that were then placed in a horizontal quartz reactor (inner diameter = 3 cm). First, the catalyst powder was reduced in situ in H 2 at 550 Â°C for 1 h. Subsequently, the sample was heated to 650 Â°C in flowing N 2 and then the flow was switched to high purity methane (100 ml/min) for the cracking reaction of methane. After one hourâ€™s reaction, the CNTs grown were cooled to room temperature in a N 2 atmos- phere. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 N 2 adsorption results Table 1 presents the data for the specific surface areas of the catalysts. The specific surface areas of the catalysts in de- creasing order were: Ni/MgO > Ni/20CeO 2 -MgO > Ni/40CeO 2 -MgO > Ni/50CeO 2 . The specific surface areas of the catalysts decreased with the increasing CeO 2 content in them. Compared with the other catalysts, the specific surface area of Ni/50CeO 2 catalyst was decreased significantly due to the absence of Mg. This would result in a low catalytic activity for the synthesis of CNTs using Ni/50CeO 2 as the catalyst. 2.2 H 2 -TPR characterization and analysis The redox properties of the catalysts were investigated with H 2 -TPR experiments. The profiles are shown in Fig. 1. The H 2 -TPR profile of Ni/MgO showed a broad reduction band. The main reduction peak appearing at 770 Â°C was assigned to the reduction of Ni species interacting strongly with the sup- port and the weak reduction peak at 500 Â°C was attributed to the reduction of Ni species which had a weak interaction with the support. Arena et al. [15] reported that the most reactive forms of NiO had undergone a progressive diffusion into the MgO lattice, and likely formed a NiOÂ·MgO solid solution Table 1 Specific surface areas of the different catalysts Catalyst Ni/MgO Ni/20CeO 2 -MgO Ni/40CeO 2 -MgO Ni/50CeO 2 A BET /(m 2 /g) 106.3 77.99 62.59 26.28 50 250 450 650 850 I n t e n s i t y Temperature ( o C) (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) 850 Fig. 1.

YANG Wen et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1323â€“1328 when the reduction temperature was higher than 600 Â°C. So, most the nickel species were in the form of a solid solution in the Ni/MgO catalyst, as the reduction temperature of these nickel species was higher than 600 Â°C. For catalysts with the composite support, the main reduction peak of the nickel species appeared at 525 Â°C for Ni/20CeO 2 -MgO and at 460 Â°C for Ni/40CeO 2 -MgO. The reduction temperature of nickel decreased with increasing CeO 2 content. There were two main reasons for the decrease of reduction temperature. First, the addition of CeO 2 inhibited the forming of a NiOÂ·MgO solid solution. When the reduction temperature was higher than 600 Â°C, hydrogen consumption by the Ni/CeO 2 -MgO catalysts decreased significantly relative to the Ni/MgO catalyst. Second, a spillover effect of hydrogen on CeO 2 also led to a decrease of the deoxidization temperature. The spillover effect of CeO 2 can be explained by that H 2 molecules adsorbed on the surface of CeO 2 spillover onto the NiO phase, which promoted the reduction of NiO [16]. At the same time, the reduction of nickel was easy to sinter for the Ni/50CeO 2 catalyst, as much nickel species was reduced at a low temperature (380 Â°C). This was proved by XRD result as follows. The decrease of reduction temperature and promotion of reduction degree of the nickel species provided more active sites for the growth of CNTs. A weak reduction peak appearing at 850 Â°C in the H 2 -TPR of CeO 2 can be attributed to the re- duction of Ce 4+ to Ce 3+ . Similar reduction peaks were ob- served for the other catalyst samples. 2.3 XPS characterization and analysis To further study the effects of cerium in these Ni-based catalysts, the Ni/MgO, Ni/20CeO 2 -MgO, Ni/40CeO 2 -MgO, and Ni/50CeO 2 samples were characterized by XPS. The Ni 2p 3/2 spectra and the corresponding Ni 2p 3/2 binding energy values of these samples are shown in Fig. 2. A typical Ni 2p 3/2 XPS spectrum of the Ni/MgO sample showed peaks at 855.01 and 861.22 eV. The peak at 861.22 eV was ascribed to a satellite peak of 855.01 eV. This catalyst had a higher Ni 2p 3/2 binding energy relative to NiO (854.5 eV) [17], which indi- cated that electron transfer took place from Ni to Mg. When Ce was added into the Ni/MgO sample, the Ni 2p 3/2 peak binding energy shifted from 855.01 to 854.73 and 854.67 eV for Ni/20CeO 2 -MgO and Ni/40CeO 2 -MgO, respectively. The significant differences in the Ni 2p 3/2 energies between the Ni/MgO and Ni/CeO 2 -MgO samples suggested that the chemical environment or structure surrounding the Ni ions were changed by the Ce element. The strong elec- tron-withdrawing property of Mg made interaction strong between Ni species and support resulting in difficult reduction Ni species for the Ni/MgO catalyst [18]. The Ni in Ni/CeO 2 -MgO was electron-rich compared with the Ni in the Ni/MgO sample. This result implied that the interaction be- tween the nickel species and support was weakened in cerium oxide promoted Ni/MgO. 2.4 XRD characterization and analysis Figure 3 shows the powder XRD patterns of the Ni/MgO, Ni/CeO 2 -MgO, and Ni/CeO 2 catalysts. These patterns have the same prominent reflections that can be assigned to NiO, a solid solution NiOÂ·MgO and MgO or a mixture of the three phases in unknown concentrations [19]. It is well known that the crystal type of MgO and NiO is cubic NaCl. Moreover, Ni 2+ (0.07 nm) and Mg 2+ (0.065 nm) have similar ionic radii [18]. Therefore, oxide solid solutions of NiOÂ·MgO can be formed with any ratio of MgO to NiO without significant structural changes that can be detected by XRD.

YANG Wen et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1323â€“1328 only remarkable feature observed in the powder XRD patterns was a progressive broadening of the respective reflection and diffraction peak of CeO 2 , which became progressively nar- rower. This indicated CeO 2 inhibited crystal formation in Ni/MgO. In the Ni/50CeO 2 catalyst, the diffraction peak of NiO became narrower than for the MgO free sample. To understand the nature of the nickel formed after the re- duction of the catalysts, Ni/20CeO 2 -MgO, Ni/40CeO 2 -MgO, and Ni/50CeO 2 were reduced at 550 o C. Subsequently, XRD data (Fig. 3) were collected from the reduced catalysts. Figure 4 shows the XRD patterns of these samples. The XRD data showed peaks due to the nickel, MgO, and CeO 2 phases. The three intense XRD peaks of 2È™ = 44.5Â°, 51.8Â°, and 76.5Â° cor- responded to the diffraction peaks of Ni. The intensities of the nickel peaks were not evidently different for Ni/20CeO 2 -MgO and Ni/40CeO 2 -MgO, but the diffraction peak of nickel be- came sharp with Ni/50CeO 2 . The particle sizes of nickel were 9.2, 8.9, and 13.2 nm for Ni/20CeO 2 -MgO, Ni/40CeO 2 , and Ni/50CeO 2 , respectively, which were estimated from the X-ray line broadening of the nickel peak at 51.8Â°. From the XRD results, the particle sizes of reduced nickel were maintained at around 9 nm. There was no sintering of the Ni/CeO 2 -MgO catalysts, which implied reduced nickel was highly dispersed on the support. However reduced nickel was sintered in Ni/50CeO 2 , resulting in the forming of large particles of Ni due to the high reducibility and the low reduction temperature of the active phase shown by the H 2 -TPR results. 2.5 Catalytic properties for the growth of carbon nanotubes Figure 5 illustrates the yield of carbon nanotubes from the different catalysts. The addition of CeO 2 significantly affected the catalytic activities of the Ni/MgO catalysts. The CNT yields from Ni/MgO, Ni/20CeO 2 -MgO, Ni/40CeO 2 -MgO, and Ni/50CeO 2 were 0.41, 3.61, 7.53, and 1.77 g/g, respectively. The result showed that the addition CeO 2 into the Ni/MgO catalyst gave a high catalytic activity for the growth of CNTs. It should be noted that the catalytic activity of Ni/50CeO 2 was significantly lower due to the low surface area and formation of large particles of nickel in the reduction process, which were shown by the BET and XRD analysis. 2.6 TEM characterization and analysis The structure and morphology of the CNTs were observed using TEM images. Figure 6 shows the microstructure of the CNTs obtained from the Ni/MgO and Ni/40CeO 2 -MgO cata- lysts. As shown in Fig. 6(a), a lot of bead-like carbon deposits and twisted CNTs were formed, while the black catalyst parti- cles were encapsulated by graphitic carbon that greatly inhib- ited the contact of catalyst and CH 4 . This also provided more evidence to explain the low activity of the Ni/MgO catalyst. Figure 6(b) showed TEM images of the CNTs grown on the Ni/40CeO 2 -MgO catalyst. A very high density of carbon nanotubes was observed. These possessed a well-crystallized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) structure with almost no amorphous carbon and catalyst particles on their surface. Some CNTs of large diameters can be found in Fig. 6(b). The diameter of the carbon nanotubes greatly depends on the size of metal particles: larger Ni particles lead to CNTs with larger diameters. Some nanoparticles that had agglomerated in the reduction process would be responsible for this. Cui el al. [20] found that the growth of CNTs had lengthening and 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Ni CeO 2 I n t e n s i t y 2T/( o ) (1) (2) (3) Fig. 4.

YANG Wen et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1323â€“1328 thickening stages. The CNTs were thickened substantially and the catalysts deactivated in the thickening stage. In the lengthening stage, the catalysts preserved their activity. The CNTs grown on the Ni/20CeO 2 -MgO catalyst were longer and thinner than those grown on the Ni/MgO catalyst. This implied the composite supports catalyst gave better catalytic activity. TEM analysis also showed that spherical catalyst particles became elongated after the synthesis of CNTs (circled in Fig. 6(a)). This elongation of the nanopaticles may be due to the strong interaction between the CNTs and the catalyst. Similar changes to the particles were found by RÃ¼mmeli et al. [21]. 2.7 TG characterization and analysis Thermogravimetry analysis is an important analytical tech- nique to show the quality of CNTs. It is used to quantitatively measure thermal stability, purity, and homogeneity [22]. Thermal stability is dependent upon a number of factors, e.g., defect density [23]. Three weight losses are recorded when the samples were heated in air. Those losses were attributed to the removal of amorphous carbon (300â€“350 Â°C), CNTs (400â€“650 Â°C) [23], and massive graphite carbon (> 700 Â°C) [24] at the different temperatures. Figure 7 illustrated the TG and DTG curves of the CNTs grown on the Ni/MgO and Ni/40CeO 2 -MgO catalysts. The TG results showed that the main weight losses were in the range of 380â€“600 and 470â€“680 Â°C for the CNTs grown on the Ni/MgO and Ni/40CeO 2 -MgO catalysts, respectively. As shown in Fig. 7(a), the weight loss was about 3 wt% before 350 Â°C from the sample grown on Ni/MgO, which indicated some impurity carbon existed. Moreover, Fig. 7 showed that the weight loss curve of the CNTs grown on Ni/40CeO 2 -MgO shifted to a higher tem- perature (from 509.9 to 626.8 Â°C) as compared with those grown on the Ni/MgO catalyst, and a narrower temperature range was observed. The weight loss of the CNTs grown on the Ni/MgO Catalyst was lower because the Ni/MgO catalyst deactivated easily, which increased the residual catalyst con- tent [23]. The presence of numerous defects along the twisted walls also probably lowered the relative thermal stability of the CNTs on Ni/MgO as these defects promoted oxidative com- bustion by providing edges and dangling bonds [8]. The oxi- dation temperature of the CNTs grown on the Ni/40CeO 2 -MgO catalyst was associated with pure, less defective, and highly crystallized CNTs. The TG results further indicated that pure and well-crystallized CNTs were grown on the Ni/40CeO 2 -MgO catalyst. 3 Conclusions The addition of CeO 2 to a Ni/MgO catalyst caused more facile reducibility of the Ni species because the formation of a hardly reducible solid solution was inhibited. The reduced nickel retained a small nanoparticle size. XPS demonstrated that the Ce species affected the chemical environment of the Ni species. As a result, the Ni/CeO 2 -MgO catalysts exhibited higher activities for the growth of CNTs. TEM and TG analy- ses showed that the Ni/MgO catalyst was much covered by graphitic carbon that inhibited interaction with the carbon source gas and consequently gave a lower activity for carbon nanotube growth. In contrast, the CNT yield obtained from the Ni/40CeO 2 -MgO catalyst was promoted and the CNTs ob- tained were pure with a well-crystallized structure.

The oxi- dation temperature of the CNTs grown on the Ni/40CeO 2 -MgO catalyst was associated with pure, less defective, and highly crystallized CNTs. The TG results further indicated that pure and well-crystallized CNTs were grown on the Ni/40CeO 2 -MgO catalyst. 3 Conclusions The addition of CeO 2 to a Ni/MgO catalyst caused more facile reducibility of the Ni species because the formation of a hardly reducible solid solution was inhibited. The reduced nickel retained a small nanoparticle size. XPS demonstrated that the Ce species affected the chemi CHNJC 60247 S1872-2067(10)60247-1 10.1016/S1872-2067(10)60247-1 Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, the Chinese Academy of Sciences This work was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2010SCU22010) and the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program, 2011CB201202).

Tel: +86-28-85403836; Fax: +86-28-85461108 Ni/MgO, Ni/CeO2-MgO, and Ni/CeO2 catalysts were prepared by the citric acid combustion method. Their catalytic properties for the synthesis of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) by chemical vapor deposition using CH4 as carbon source were evaluated. The catalysts were characterized with N2 adsorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The quality and structure of the CNTs were characterized by thermogravimetry (TG) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). H2-TPR showed that CeO2 helped decrease the reduction temperature and increase the content of an easily reducible Ni species. XPS showed an energy shift of the Ni catalyst that was modified by CeO2. XRD showed that the reduced nickel maintained their small particle sizes in the Ni/CeO2-MgO catalysts. These findings suggested that the addition of CeO2 changed the chemical environment of the nickel species, which resulted in a weaker interaction between the nickel and the support and increased the reducibility of the Ni species. Moreover, the reduced nickel was highly dispersed on the CeO2-MgO support. The change enhanced the catalytic activity for the growth of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Characterization by TG and TEM showed that the quality of the CNTs grown on Ni/CeO2-MgO was better than those grown on Ni/MgO catalyst.
