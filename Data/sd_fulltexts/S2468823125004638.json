Selective hydrogenation of nitroaromatics to anilines is a kind of important reaction in pharmacy industry and fine chemical engineering. However, this reaction is restrained by lack of catalysts and reaction system with high efficiency, energy saving, environmental protection and high selectivity. Herein, Cu nanoclusters were successfully encapsulated into Silicalite-1 zeolite by in-situ hydrothermal synthesis with ligand protection to obtain Cu@S-1 catalyst. The catalyst showed an excellent selectivity of 98 % with substrate conversion of 100 % in the hydrogenation of p-nitrostyrene to 4-vinylaniline using ammonia borane as hydrogen source, which was due to the preferential adsorption effect of Cu@S-1 catalyst on the nitro group. The Cu@S-1 catalyst also exhibits good recycling performance and substrate compatibility.

In addition to the demand of ensuring that the catalyst used in the reaction has sufficient activity, another point that needs attention is how to improve the selectivity of the catalysts, thus the reactions aiming at the production of high value-added target products have been studied persistently. Current hydrogenation reactions can be divided into CO x (CO, CO2) hydrogenation, [5–8] alkyne hydrogenation [9–12], benzene derivatives hydrogenation [13–16], biomass hydrogenation [17–20], etc. according to reactants. Noticeably, selective reduction of nitroaromatics (Ar-NO2) to amines (Ar-NH2) is an important step in the preparation of a variety of organic compounds for applications in medicine, polymers, herbicides, and fine chemicals [21,22]. Nanosized transition metal/metal oxides have shown great potential in the field of -NO2 reduction due to their high activity, ease of separation, and recoverability. However, it is difficult to achieve selective reduction of Ar-NO2 under catalytic conditions without affecting other reducible functional groups. In particular, the competitive hydrogenation of Ar-NO2 and Ar-C=C leads to challenges in selective conversion of Ar-NO2 without affecting Ar-C=C. In 2006, Corma and Serna first reported that Au-based catalysts showed good selectivity for the reduction of 3-nitrobenzene [23]. Since then, various noble metals have been widely used for selective reduction of nitroaromatics. Among them, Pt is one of the most efficient and commonly used catalysts in the hydrogenation of nitroaromatics [24]. However, it was more effective toward vinyl in the hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene, resulting in fewer products and more by-products for a single selective conversion of nitro [25]. Besides, due to the small reserves of noble metals such as Pt in nature, the mining cost is relatively high. Recently, the application of non-noble metal catalysts has also attracted widespread attention. Jagadeesh et al. [26,27] reported that catalysts based on a large number of available transition metals (such as Fe, Co, Mo and Ni) improved selective hydrogenation of nitroaromatics. Zhou et al. [28] found that atomically dispersed monoatomic catalysts in the form of M-N-C (M=Fe, Co and Ni) had high catalytic activity for chemically selective hydrogenation of functionalized nitroaromatics. Despite progress made with non-noble metal catalysts for selective hydrogenation processes, the catalytic reaction typically requires running for hours under temperatures above 373 K and high pressure H2, which makes the reaction high-cost and dangerous to operate under H2 atmosphere. Alternatively, ammonia borane is considered a safe material for hydrogen storage and transport [29]. The low molecular weight, high hydrogen content and the formation of a stable crystalline solid to lead handle easily together make ammonia borane a promising and highly effective hydrogenation transfer agent [30]. In the presence of transition metal catalysts, H2 can be released from ammonia borane at low temperatures and ambient pressure to avoid high pressure very well, therefore, ammonia borane has been widely used in hydrogenation of nitrobenzene derivatives to amines at mild reaction conditions [31,32]. However, when a second reducible functional group (e.g. vinyl) is present in the aromatic structure, the reaction selectivity is often poor due to the unavoidable simultaneous adsorption of nitro and vinyl groups on metal sites [33]. Zeolites has been widely used for directing the reaction of molecules with multiple reducible groups towards target products through the shape-selective catalysis of zeolites. Xiao et al. [34] encapsulated Pd, Ru, and Pt metal nanoparticles into the crystal structure of zeolites during the synthesis process, obtaining metal@zeolite catalytic materials similar to pitaya structure. Among them, the Pd@Beta catalyst showed nearly 100 % high selectivity in the nitro group directed hydrogenation reaction of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde, while the selectivity by Pd/beta catalyst was only 1.6 %. The adsorption behavior of nitrobenzene compounds molecules on the material was studied by means of in situ infrared spectroscopy, online Raman spectroscopy, etc., revealing the stereoscopic adsorption control mechanism of zeolite pores for nitrobenzene molecules with different substituents. Therefore, the combination of non-noble metal catalysts and zeolite supports can maximize the advantage of active sites and zeolite structures to improve the yield of target products. Notably, Cu-based catalysts have been widely used due to their low cost and high activity in hydrogenation reactions [35–38], which makes it possible to construct a Cu-zeolite catalyst effective in nitrobenzene hydrogenation. In this work, Silicalite-1 zeolite encapsulated Cu clusters (Cu@S-1) was synthesized in one-pot method by in-situ hydrothermal synthesis using tetraethylenepentamine as ligand of copper nitrate, tetrapropyl ammonium hydroxide as template, and tetraethyl silicate as silicon source. The morphology and structure of Cu@S-1 samples were characterized and verified by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR). The related properties of Cu@S-1 catalyst for hydrogenation of p-nitrostyrene were studied using ammonia borane as hydrogen source. 2 Experimental procedures 2.1 Reagents and materials Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 99.99 %, Aladdin), tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH, 40 %, TCI), copper nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, 99.99 %, Aladdin), tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA, TCI), p-nitrostyrene (98 %, Aladdin), ammonia borane (NH3BH3, 97 %, Macklin), Pt/C (20 wt. % Pt on carbon, Alfa Aesar), platinum oxide (PtO2, 83 wt. % Pt, Acros), toluene (AR, Xilong Chemical), ethanol (AR, Aladdin) and acetonitrile (AR, Aladdin) were obtained. All reagents were used directly without further purification. 2.2 Synthesis of S-1 zeolite 20 g of TEOS was added into 31.25 g of deionized water in a beaker, then 7.125 g of TPAOH was added rapidly, and the beaker was sealed and stirred at 800r/min for 3–4 h until the solution was clear. Then the solution was heated in a 60℃ water bath for 1.5 h under stirring to obtain zeolite precursor gel. The gel was transferred to a 100 mL PTFE-lined stainless-steel autoclave and crystallized in a convection oven at 170 °C for 2 days. The resulting solids were filtered and washed with deionized water, then dried at 100 °C for 12 h. Subsequently, the obtained powder was calcined in air at 550 °C for 6 h with the heating rate of 1 °C /min to obtain pure S-1 zeolite. 2.3 Synthesis of S-1 zeolite supported Cu clusters (Cu/S-1) 0.0755 g of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O was dissolved in 5 mL of H2O, and then 1 g of S-1 zeolite was added to the above solution. The resulting solution was stirred at 80 °C for 2 h, then the resulting liquid was centrifuged, filtered, and dried at 100 °C for 12 h. Next, the obtained powder was calcined in air at 550 °C for 6 h with the heating rate of 1 ℃/min, and then reduced in a hydrogen atmosphere (95 % N2+5 % H2) at 400 ℃ for 2 h to obtain the Cu/S-1 catalyst. 2.4 Synthesis of S-1 zeolite encapsulated Cu clusters (Cu@S-1) 20 g of TEOS was added into 31.25 g of deionized water in a beaker, then 7.125 g of TPAOH was added rapidly, and the beaker was sealed and stirred at 800r/min for 3–4 h until the solution was clear. Then the solution was heated in a 60℃ water bath for 1.5 h under stirring to obtain S-1 zeolite precursor gel. Then 0.43 g of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O was dissolved in 10 mL of deionized water. After the solution was clear, 0.37 g of TEPA was slowly dropped into the solution, and then the above mixed solution was dropped into S-1 gel. Finally, the gel was transferred to a 100 mL PTFE-lined stainless-steel autoclave and crystallized in a convection oven at 170 °C for 2 days. The resulting solids were filtered and washed in deionized water, then dried at 100 °C for 12 h. Subsequently, the obtained powder was calcined in air at 550 °C for 6 h with the heating rate of 1 °C /min, and then reduced in a hydrogen atmosphere (95 %N2+5 %H2) at 400 °C for 2 h to obtain the Cu@S-1 catalyst. 2.5 Performance of various catalysts for p-nitrostyrene hydrogenation The catalytic properties of Cu@S-1, Cu/S-1, Pt/C, S-1 and PtO2 samples for hydrogenation of p-nitrostyrene were investigated. Taking Cu@S-1 as an example, 100 mg of Cu@S-1 catalyst and 7 mL of ethanol were added into a two-neck flask, one mouth of which was sealed with a rubber stopper and the other mouth was sealed with a balloon. Then the flask was placed in an oil bath and preheated at 60 ℃. After ten minutes, 126 mg of ammonia borane and 0.6 mmol of p-nitrostyrene were dissolved in 3 mL of ethanol, which was then injected into the two-neck flask with a syringe. The reaction results were detected and analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC 8890, Agilent) equipped with a flame ionization detector. 2.6 Study on cycle stability of Cu@S-1 catalyst (1) Catalytic hydrogen production by ammonia borane The reaction conditions were the same as above without adding p-nitrostyrene. The hydrogen produced was collected by drainage method, and the volume of hydrogen produced at each time was recorded. (2) Catalytic hydrogenation of p-nitrostyrene The reaction conditions were the same as the p-nitrostyrene hydrogenation above. After 60 min of reaction, the catalyst was removed, centrifuged, washed and dried, and used again. The experiment was repeated according to the above conditions, and the conversion of p-nitrostyrene and the selectivity of p-vinylaniline after each reaction were recorded, and the influence of cycle times on the reaction was observed. 2.7 Effects of different hydrogen sources on reaction performances Using 100 mg of Cu@S-1 zeolite as catalyst, the reaction conditions were the same as above when the hydrogen source was ammonia borane; When the hydrogen source was H2, no ammonia borane was added, and other conditions were the same as above. When the hydrogen source was acetic acid, the solvent was changed to 7 mL of ethanol and 3 mL of acetic acid, and ammonia borane was not added, while other conditions were the same as above. 2.8 Effects of different solvents on the reaction performances Methanol, ethanol, propanol, n-butanol, acetonitrile and toluene were used as solvents, and 10 mL of one kind of solvent was used for each reaction. Other reaction conditions were the same as above. The conversion and selectivity under each solvent were recorded by gas chromatography. 2.9 Cu@S-1 catalyzed selective hydrogenation of nitro group and C=C bond 0.05 mmol of nitrobenzene and 0.05 mmol of styrene were mixed as reactants, and other conditions were the same as above. The conversion and selectivity were recorded by gas chromatography. 2.10 Expansion of catalytic hydrogenation of nitroaromatic compounds by Cu@S-1 The hydrogenation performance of Cu@S-1 catalyst for 3-nitrostyrene, 3-nitropyridine, 4-nitrophenol, 4-nitroanisole, 4-nitrofluorobenzene, 4-nitrochlorobenzene, 4-nitrobromobenzene, methyl 4-nitrophenylacetate and 4-nitroethylbenzene was investigated. The reaction conditions were listed in Table S2. The conversion and selectivity were recorded by gas chromatography. 2.11 Characterizations Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was conducted on the instrument model of Ultima IV equipped with a Cu target, operating at 40 kV and 40 mA. Cu contents in catalysts were detected by ICP-MS analysis with an Agilent 7500CE instrument. The morphology and size of the zeolite samples were analyzed by JSM-6330F field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM). High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM) was performed on a JEM-3200FS from JEOL. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were conducted on a Kratos AXIS ULtrabld spectrometer equipped with monochromatic Al Kα radiation. The binding energies were measured within the error of 0.05 eV. 1H NMR spectra was obtained on Bruker Ascend 600 spectrometer and the chemical shifts were referenced to deuterated chloroform. The hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was performed in a chemisorption analyzer (AutoChem II 2920). 2.12 Theoretical calculations Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to gain insight into the mechanism of selectivity enhancement upon confinement. The active sites were approximated to those on Cu(111) surfaces because of the 4 nm average size of Cu nanopartical, the surface of which is large enough to be regarded as a flat surface from the atomic point of view. The adsorption of all reactants on Cu(111) surfaces was modeled using a four-layer slab in a 4 × 4 supercell to ensure to contain p-nitrostyrene. The bottom three layers were fixed to simulate bulk effects on the surface. The slabs in different supercells were separated by a 15 Å vacuum layer. All DFT calculations were performed using the Quantum Espresso package [39]. Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional [40] was used to describe the exchange-correlation interactions. A plane-wave basis set with a kinetic energy cutoff of 816 eV was used to expand the wavefunction. The van der Waals interactions were accounted for by Grimme-D3 scheme [41]. The first Brillouin zone was sampled using a 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack grid of k-points [42]. The geometries of the models were optimized until the residual force was reduced to 0.026 eV/Å. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structural characterization of Cu@S-1 zeolite The S-1 zeolite, Cu@S-1 zeolite and Cu/S-1 zeolite were characterized by XRD. As shown in Fig. 1a , the location of diffraction peaks of S-1, Cu@S-1, and Cu/S-1 zeolites are almost identical. At the diffraction angles (2θ) of 7.9°, 8.8°, 23.1°, 23.8°, and 24.3°, the diffraction peaks of typical MFI framework structure are all present, and there are no obvious mixed peaks. This indicates that S-1 zeolite can be prepared by hydrothermal synthesis without metal precursor and in situ synthesis with metal precursor. There is no characteristic peak of Cu in the XRD curve of Cu@S-1 zeolite, indicating that most of Cu particles in the packaged Cu@S-1 catalyst could be located inside the zeolite and no large particles are produced. Through SEM images of Cu@S-1 zeolite (Fig. 1b), it can be seen that Cu@S-1 zeolite has a traditional plate structure, and the particle size distribution analysis shows that the zeolite has a wide particle size distribution (2–5 μm). The average particle size of Cu@S-1 catalyst is 2.96 μm. The ICP-MS test on Cu@S-1 zeolite shows that the mass fraction of Cu in Cu@S-1 zeolite is about 1.8 %, which is similar to the input of Cu in the initial raw material, indicating the successful encapsulation of Cu into S-1 zeolite and the high metal encapsulation efficiency of this method. As shown in Fig. 1c, the size distribution of Cu nanoclusters in Cu@S-1 zeolite is uniform, and there is no obvious agglomeration phenomenon, which is consistent with the XRD characterization results. In addition, the particle size distribution diagram of Cu nanoclusters also shows that the average particle size of Cu is 1.25 nm, and there are few Cu clusters exceeding 2 nm. In Fig. 1d, the main components of Cu@S-1 zeolite synthesized by in-situ encapsulation are Si and O elements which constitute the framework of the zeolite, and the supported metal element Cu. It can be seen from the figure that Cu nanoclusters are homogeneously distributed on S-1 zeolite. At the same time, the size of Cu nanoclusters in Cu/S-1 zeolite prepared by impregnation method is larger than that in Cu@S-1, with an average particle size of 1.46 nm (Fig. 2a ). The distribution of Cu nanoclusters is more uniform, but there are larger particles. The EDS-mapping results of Cu/S-1 zeolite (Fig. 2b) also show that Cu nanoclusters are uniformly distributed on S-1 zeolite surface. The XPS characterizations of Cu@S-1 and Cu/S-1 zeolites are shown in Fig. 3a . The surface of Cu/S-1 zeolite prepared by the impregnation method is detected obvious characteristic peaks of Cu, such as the orbital peak energies of 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of Cu0 and Cu+ were 933.2 and 953.0 eV, respectively. The orbital peak energy of Cu2+ 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 are 935.3 eV and 955.2 eV, respectively, and there are also vibrating satellite peaks (940–945 eV) in the XPS spectrum of this sample, which indicates the presence of copper oxide in Cu species. However, the Cu@S-1 zeolite prepared by in situ encapsulation can only detect relatively weak characteristic peaks of Cu0 and Cu+ in the corresponding range, while for Cu/S-1 zeolite prepared by impregnation method, Cu species existed on the outer surface of the zeolite and was detected by XPS. Both the XPS results and the EDS-mapping results reveal that Cu nanoclusters are distributed inside the S-1 zeolite, which successfully realizes the encapsulation of Cu. These results once again demonstrated that Cu nanoparticles were successfully encapsulated into S-1 zeolites. In order to further verify the successful encapsulation of Cu clusters into S-1 zeolite, the as-synthesized Cu@S-1 and Cu/S-1 zeolites without reduction were characterized by hydrogen-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR). As shown in Fig. 3b, the H2-TPR profile of Cu@S-1 shows two reduction characteristic peaks of Cu element at 475 K and 554 K, corresponding to the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+ and Cu+ to Cu0 respectively [43]. There are also two characteristic peaks in the H2-TPR profile of Cu/S-1 zeolite, but the reduction temperatures of Cu/S-1 (465 K and 529 K) are slightly lower than that of Cu@S-1. Therefore, it can be inferred that CuO in Cu@S-1 zeolite is more difficult to reduce during H2 treatment than its counterpart in Cu/S-1. This further confirms the enhanced interaction between encapsulated Cu species and the silanol groups of S-1 zeolite, which stabilizes Cu2+ species, resulting in the more difficult reduction of Cu2+ in Cu@S-1 zeolite. This result once again confirms that Cu nanoclusters are successfully encapsulated into S-1 zeolite. The effect of encapsulation on the distribution of Cu is investigated through the TEM. Fig. 4 shows the TEM images of Cu@S-1 zeolite and Cu/S-1 zeolite after calcination in static air at 550℃. As can be seen from the figure, Cu nanoclusters in Cu@S-1 catalyst are still evenly distributed after calcination, with an average particle size of about 1.69 nm, which increases slightly compared to as-synthesized sample (Fig. 1c). In contrast, the distribution of Cu nanoclusters in Cu/S-1 zeolite is less uniform. The average particle size of Cu in Cu/S-1 is 3.75 nm, which is about 2.5 times of those before calcination, which also indicates that the encapsulation of Cu nanoclusters in Cu@S-1 zeolite prohibits the segregation of it. In addition, BET specific surface area tests were carried out for S-1 and Cu@S-1 catalysts, and the test results are shown in Table S1. The specific surface area and pore volume of S-1 are higher than those of Cu@S-1. This is due to the Cu clusters dispersed in the S-1 zeolite occupying the positions in the zeolite channels. 3.2 Catalytic performance of Cu@S-1 catalyst in p-nitrostyrene hydrogenation In this work, the hydrogenation of p-nitrostyrene with ammonia borane catalyzed by Cu@S-1 zeolite to 4-vinylaniline was taken as an example to explore the enhancement of activity and selectivity of Cu@S-1 zeolite. Its mechanism was then analyzed. There are three main reducing groups in p-nitrostyrene: benzene ring, nitro group and C=C bond, among which the benzene ring is the most difficult to activate for hydrogenation [44]. Therefore, this work mainly considers the competitive hydrogenation reactions of nitro group and C=C bond. Then the hydrogen produced by ammonia borane was used as hydrogen source to realize the hydrogenation of p-nitrostyrene under the activity of catalyst. Firstly, the hydrogenation catalytic properties of Cu@S-1 zeolite prepared by in-situ encapsulation and Cu/S-1 zeolite prepared by impregnation were studied. As shown in Fig. 5a , Cu@S-1 catalyst exhibits a 4-vinylaniline selectivity of up to 98 % at 98 % conversion, while Cu/S-1 catalyst exhibits a selectivity of only 70 %. This may be due to the limiting effect of zeolite on Cu nanoclusters, which inhibits the over-hydrogenation of the reaction and affects the adsorption of p-nitrostyrene on the catalyst to a certain extent. The effect of solvent type on the performance of p-nitrostyrene hydrogenation catalyzed by Cu@S-1 zeolite was further investigated. Methanol, ethanol, propanol, n-butanol, acetonitrile and toluene were compared. As shown in Fig. 5b, under the same reaction conditions, the catalyst activity was higher when alcohols were used as solvent. Especially when ethanol was used as solvent, the p-nitrostyrene conversion reached 100 % and the 4-vinylaniline selectivity was as high as 98 %, which was higher than that in methanol. This may be due to the higher decomposition activity of ammonia borane in methanol than that in ethanol, resulting in the production of a large amount of H2 in a short period of time, so that part of C=C bonds were unavoidably reduced, resulting in poorer 4-vinylaniline selectivity than that in ethanol [45]. When the solvent was propanol or n-butanol, the p-nitrostyrene conversion was low, which may be caused by the low decomposition activity of ammonia borane in the two solvents [45]. In addition, when acetonitrile and toluene were used as solvents, the reaction cannot be carried out, because there is no hydroxyl group in acetonitrile and toluene cannot react with ammonia borane to decompose and produce hydrogen. Subsequently, the effects of different hydrogen sources on the reaction were studied. As shown in Fig. 5c, when ammonia borane was used as the hydrogen source, both the conversion and selectivity of the reaction were excellent. However, when pure hydrogen was used as the hydrogen source (without ammonia borane, 0.1 MPa H2) and the reaction time was the same, there was basically no conversion of p-nitrostyrene. This shows that hydrogen alone cannot hydrogenate p-nitrostyrene under these conditions. At the same time, when acetic acid was used as the hydrogen source (no ammonia borane was added, acetic acid was used as the solvent), the conversion of p-nitrostyrene was still very low. It was inferred that the acidity of acetic acid destroyed the zeolite structure, and the reaction could not be carried out by hydrogen transfer. The influence of different catalysts on the hydrogenation reaction was then studied and the results are shown in Fig. 5d The results showed that the reaction could not be carried out without catalyst, and the transition metal Cu could promote the hydrogenation of p-nitrostyrene to 4-vinylaniline. In addition, although the catalytic activities of common noble metal catalysts such as Pt/C and PtO2 were very high, the selectivities were poor, which was due to the excessive catalytic hydrogenation activity of noble metals, which reduced both the nitro and vinyl groups. Figure S1 and Fig. 6 show the reusability performance of Cu@S-1 zeolite in hydrogenation of p-nitrostyrene. As shown in Figure S1, the catalyst has carried out three cyclic experiments on hydrogen production by alcoholysis of ammonia borane. It can be seen from the figure that with the increase of reaction times, the hydrogen production content of ammonia borane has gradually decreased by around 10 %. This may be due to the precipitation of some Cu species during the reaction [46]. Fig. 6 shows five cycle tests of hydrogenation of p-nitrostyrene by the catalyst. It can be seen from the figure that the performance of the catalyst for the hydrogenation of p-nitrostyrene is basically unchanged with the deepening of the number of cycles, indicating that the catalyst exhibits relatively stable catalytic hydrogenation performance. In order to explore the reason for the high selectivity of Cu@S-1 zeolite in the hydrogenation reaction of p-nitrostyrene, selective hydrogenation experiments on nitro and vinyl groups were carried out, as shown in Fig. 7a . Nitrobenzene and styrene were used as reactants for hydrogenation with Cu@S-1 zeolite. The results showed that, when the reactants contain both nitrobenzene and styrene, the catalyst exhibits a high conversion of 89 % for nitrobenzene, while the conversion of styrene is only 1 %. This indicates that Cu@S-1 zeolite preferentially adsorbs nitrobenzene when nitro and vinyl groups are present at the same time. This result is consistent with the excellent performance of the catalyst in the hydrogenation of p-nitrostyrene. To further investigate the mechanism for the high selectivity of Cu@S-1 catalyst, a competitive adsorption test of nitro and vinyl groups was carried out. As shown in Fig. 7b, the adsorption behavior of nitro groups in p-nitrostyrene molecules on the Cu@S-1 zeolite was simulated using nitrobenzene as the model, and the adsorption behavior of vinyl groups on the Cu@S-1 zeolite was simulated using styrene as the model matrix. As shown in the figure, when nitrobenzene and styrene were mixed with Cu@S-1 respectively, and 1H NMR characterization was performed after the physically adsorbed molecules were removed, NMR signals corresponding to nitrobenzene and styrene were observed, indicating that the two molecules could be adsorbed on the surface of Cu@S-1 zeolite. When the mixture of nitrobenzene and styrene of 1:1 molar ratio was exposed to Cu@S-1 catalyst, although 1H NMR peak of nitrobenzene and styrene were detected at the same time, based on the analysis of NMR peak area, it was observed that the adsorption of nitrobenzene on Cu@S-1 catalyst was more favorable than that of styrene. For nitrobenzene molecules, the peak at 8.21 ppm is taken as an example, and for styrene molecules, the peak is 5.25 ppm. In theory, for a mixture of nitrobenzene and styrene with a molar ratio of 1:1, the peaking area ratio (nitrobenzene to styrene) at these two chemical shifts should be 2:1, which is the same as the ratio of numbers of H atoms that the two peaks correspond with respectively (shown as red “H” in Fig. 6c); however, the peaking area ratio observed in Fig. 7c is 4.65:1, much higher than the 2:1 value. The results show that in the adsorption process of nitrobenzene and styrene, nitrobenzene is more easily adsorbed on the surface of Cu@S-1 than styrene, which is consistent with the experimental results of competitive hydrogenation of nitrobenzene and styrene above. Next, the structural factors on the selectivity are investigated to explain the low conversion rate of styrene. On flat surfaces, aromatic rings in nitroaromatic molecules are usually parallel to the metal surface, and both the nitro and vinyl groups strongly interact with the Cu site when p-nitrostyrene is adsorbed on the Cu/S-1 zeolite (Figure S2a). In parallel adsorption of p-nitrostyrene on the surface of Cu nanoparticles, both nitro and vinyl groups interact with Cu sites, which may lead to hydrogenation of the two groups. In contrast, because the pores of S-1 zeolite are relatively small (about 5.6 Å). Through theoretical calculation, it was found that the molecular size of p-nitrostyrene was 10.10 Å × 6.39 Å (Figure S2c), which made it almost impossible for p-nitrostyrene to approach the Cu nanoclusters in a parallel way. According to the subcell topological flexible structure of zeolite, the maximum molecular size that can diffuse along MFI framework is 6.44 Å [47]. Therefore, when p-nitrostyrene is adsorbed on Cu@S-1, we infer that the molecules are arranged parallel to the microporous channels, prohibiting the flat configuration of adsorption (Figure S2b). Thus, zeolite micropores alter the spatial change in the adsorption of the molecule at the Cu site in contact with the micropores, resulting in the nitro group binding to the Cu site because the nitro group interacts more strongly with the metal surface than the vinyl group. Combined with the above adsorption experimental results, it can be concluded that p-nitrostyrene molecules are arranged in parallel to the pore channels and in contact with Cu nanoclusters. Due to the preferential adsorption of nitro by Cu@S-1 zeolite, nitro groups preferentially enter the zeolite pore channels, thus achieving high selectivity of the reaction. The mechanism underlying the selectivity enhancement through confinement was investigated using DFT calculations. Four distinct adsorption configurations were identified on the Cu(111) surface, as illustrated in Fig. 8 . p-Nitrostyrene can adsorb in either a flat configuration (Fig. 8a) or an end-on configuration where the NO2 group binds to the surface (Fig. 8b). Notably, the end-on configuration with vinyl group binding to Cu surface was impossibly for the calculated approaching zero interaction energy. In the flat configuration, the adsorption interaction is predominantly governed by van der Waals forces, with an average adsorbate-surface distance of 2.53 Å, in which, both the nitro group and vinyl group were interaction with Cu(111) surface simultaneously. Conversely, the end-on configuration was mainly stabilized by the formation of an OCu bond, in which, the vinyl group did not interact with the surface, thus significantly reduces the possibility of vinyl group hydrogenation. As calculated, the adsorption energy of the flat configuration was 70 kJ/mol stronger than that of the end-on configuration where the nitro end was bound to the surface (Fig. 8c). Hence, for the impregnated Cu/S-1, owing to without spatial confinement effect, presumably, the reactant p-nitrostyrene preferred to adsorb onto Cu surface with flat-lying conformation, and the adsorbed nitro group and vinyl group were activated and reacted simultaneously, thus giving the unsatisfactory selectivity to desired 4-vinylaniline. For the encapsulated Cu@S-1 catalyst, thanks to the confinement effect from silicalite-1 zeolite channel to force p-nitrostyrene diffusion into its channel with end-on conformation rather than flat-lying conformation, therefore, based on above DFT calculation results, the p-nitrostyrene can be adsorbed and activated onto encapsulated Cu surface preferentially in an end-on configuration with the end of nitro group that protected the vinyl group from being hydrogenated, so exhibiting the remarkable catalytic selectivity. The Cu@S-1 catalyst also showed good substrate compatibility. As shown in Table S2, Cu@S-1 catalyst shows good conversion and selectivity for 3-nitrostyrene, 3-nitropyridine, 4-nitrophenol, 4-nitroanisole, 4-nitrofluorobenzene, 4-nitrochlorobenzene, 4-nitrobromobenzene, 4-nitroacetate methyl ester, 4-nitroethylbenzene and nitrobenzene substrates. When C=C bonds were introduced into the benzene intersite, the catalyst showed the conversion of up to 96 % and the selectivity of 97 %. When the pyridine ring is introduced, the catalyst is still highly selective for nitro groups (100 %). When halogen groups were introduced, the catalyst also showed good activity (conversion >95 %) and selectivity (100 %), avoiding the break of halogen-carbon bonds. 4 Conclusion In this work, we designed the catalyst Cu@S-1 based on the concept of conformational regulation of reactant molecular adsorption to selectively adsob nitro group in nitrostyrene molecule. Cu nanoclusters were successfully encapsulated into S-1 zeolite using ligand protection method. The catalyst showed excellent performance in the hydrogenation of p-nitrostyrene using ammonia borane as hydrogen source. Compared with the traditional supported catalyst Cu/S-1 and the commonly used industrial noble metal catalysts Pt/C and PtO2, Cu@S-1 catalyst shows better selectivity towards 4-vinylaniline. The competitive hydrogenation and adsorption tests of nitro and olefin further prove that Cu@S-1 catalyst has a preferential adsorption effect on nitro. The DFT calculations further prove that p-nitrostyrene molecules are primarily adsorbed on Cu surface in an end-on configuration with the contact of nitro group, which induces the excellent catalytic selectivity of 4-vinylaniline. The Cu@S-1 catalyst also exhibits good recycling performance, and the conversion and selectivity can remain above 95 % after five cycle tests. In addition, the catalyst also has good substrate compatibility, which is suitable for the hydrogenation of various nitroaromatic compounds and proves the rationality of the catalyst design idea.

        "dc:description": "Selective hydrogenation of nitroaromatics to anilines is a kind of important reaction in pharmacy industry and fine chemical engineering. However, this reaction is restrained by lack of catalysts and reaction system with high efficiency, energy saving, environmental protection and high selectivity. Herein, Cu nanoclusters were successfully encapsulated into Silicalite-1 zeolite by in-situ hydrothermal synthesis with ligand protection to obtain Cu@S-1 catalyst. The catalyst showed an excellent selectivity of 98 % with substrate conversion of 100 % in the hydrogenation of p-nitrostyrene to 4-vinylaniline using ammonia borane as hydrogen source, which was due to the preferential adsorption effect of Cu@S-1 catalyst on the nitro group. The Cu@S-1 catalyst also exhibits good recycling performance and substrate compatibility.",
