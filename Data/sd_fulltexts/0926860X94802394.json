In particular, a bismuth modified palladium catalyst supported on Si02 and a thallium modified catalyst on active carbon provided 3FH and 3FC1 with more than 90% yield at 520-600 K. Kinetic studies suggest that the reaction route is CFC-1130 3170 ) -) 3FH and that the role of the metal additives is to suppress the hydrodechlorination of 3FC1 to 3FH or further hydrogenation of 31711. The thermodynamic estimations imply that the modifier plays another role in the inhibition of hydrodefluorination. The IR studies of carbon monoxide chemisorption on the modified palladium catalysts show that the addition of bismuth or thallium leads to a drastic suppression of bridged carbon monoxide on palladium and to the enhancement of linear carbon monoxide. This shift indicates that the addition of the promoter results in the breaking the ensembles of palladium atoms. Further evidence for this mechanism comes from the temperature-programmed reduction spectra, where a reduction peak shifts to higher temper ature. X-ray diffraction spectra, where a broad peak based on palladium shifted to low angle of 20 by the addition of thallium, indicates the formation of TI-Pd alloy or intermetallic compound.

Introduction The use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) has to be discontinued by the year of 1996 because of the global environmental problems, e.g., the destructive effect on the stratospheric ozone layer promoted by chlorine atoms dissociated from CFCs [ 1 ] .

Target products in the reaction of CFC-113 with hydrogen. destruction of recovered CFCs are urgently needed. It is particularly promising to convert recovered CFCs catalytically to harmless and preferably to useful chemicals [2,3]. 1,1,2Trichlorotrifluoroethane (CFC-113), one of the CFCs, may be catalytically transformed to chlorotrifluoroethene (3FC1) or to trifluoroethene (3FH) via hydrodechlorination without loss of fluorine atoms in the molecule (see Scheme 1). Both products, 3FC1 and 3FH, are monomers for Teflon-like polymers. Furthermore, 3FH can serve as a key intermediate in the synthesis of 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a), a proposed replacement for dichlorodifluoromethane (CFC-12) as a coolant. It has been reported that in catalytic hydrodechlorination 3FC1 was selectively obtained on charcoal [4], nickel [5] or oxides of Ni-Cr, Fe-Cr, and manganese [6,7] catalysts at an elevated temperature of 700-800 K, but these catalysts were negligibly active for the formation of 3FH. Noble metals, such as Pd, Pt, Rh, promote the reaction of CFC-113 with hydrogen at a lower temperature but yield a less selective product distribution [ 8-11 ] . We will report here that palladium catalysts modified by selected metal additives provide both high activity and selectivity in the hydrodechlorination of CFC-113 to 3FC1 or 3FH at a low temperature between 520 and 600 K. The role of the selected metal additives has been studied in the reactions of 3FC1 and 1,2-dichlorotrifluoroethane, the reaction products of CFC-113, with hydrogen on the modified palladium catalysts. Fourier transform IR (FTIR) of adsorbed carbon monoxide, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) has been conducted to characterize the thallium and bismuth modified palladium catalysts. From these data, a model of the surface modification due to the metal additive overlayer on the palladium catalyst is proposed. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts Catalysts containing 5 wt.-% Pd, Rh, Pt and Ru and 0.5 wt.-% Pd supported on A1203 and 5 wt.-% Pd on active carbon were obtained from N.E. Chemcat. A catalyst containing 2 wt.-% Pd on Si02 was prepared by the conventional impregnation of Si02 (Fuji-Davison, #57) with PdC12 (Kanto Chem. Co., Inc.) from aqueous solution. The impregnated catalyst was dried at 350 K overnight and reduced in flowing hydrogen at 570 K for 3 h. The 5, 2 and 0.5 wt.-% Pd catalysts were further impregnated with some metal salt modifiers. Before the reaction, all the catalysts were reduced in a hydrogen stream at 670 K or 570 K for 2 h after drying at 350 K overnight. The modified catalysts are denoted as nM-mPd/S R.

Reactions The reaction of CFC-113 (b.p.=320-321 K) with hydrogen was carried out under atmospheric pressure in a continuous flow system with a fixed-bed reactor made from Pyrex glass (O 10 mm X 200 mm length). The other part of the apparatus was made from 304 stainless steel tubing. The schematic drawing of the apparatus is shown in Fig. 1. CFC-113 and hydrogen feeds are controlled by a syringe pump (Furue Sci., JP type micro-feeder) and a mass flow controller (Ueshima-Brooks, 5ss50E), respectively. Before submitting it into the reactor, the feed gas was mixed thoroughly in a heated mixing chamber. The total flow-rate of feed gas was 21 and 30 ml/min in the case of 0.5 wt.-% Pd/A1203 and the others, respectively, with a mole ratio of HZ:CFC-113 =2:1. The effluent from the reactor, which was bubbled through and absorbed with warmed water and a warmed 20 wt.-% KOH aqueous solution to remove any HCl and HF formed, was analyzed every 1 h of reaction time by a gas chromatograph with a 2-m Porapak Q column. Further, the reaction temperature was raised every 5 or 10 h. The amount of catalyst used was 4 g in the case of 0.5 wt.% Pd/A1203 and 1 g with all other catalysts. The reactions of 3FC1 (Daikin Ind. Ltd., b.p.=222 K) and 1,2-dichlorotrifluoroethane (Daikin Ind. Ltd., b.p. = 301 K) with hydrogen were performed in the same reaction apparatus, except that 3FC1 was dosed in through a mass flow controller. 2.3. FT-IR, TPR, XRD and carbon monoxide adsorption studies FT-IR spectra of chemisorbed carbon monoxide were measured in a Shimadzu FTIR4100 or 8100M.

Spectra were recorded after evacuation at 10-2 Pa for 2 min to remove the residual carbon monoxide gas. TPR measurements were performed with an Altamira AMI1. The experimental parameters used were flow-rate: 20 ml/min, heating rate: 5 K/min, weight of catalyst: 40 mg, temperature span: 300-870 K. Before each TPR experiment, the catalyst was pretreated with air at 670 K for 1 h in the TPR cell. Then, the sample was cooled to 230-240 K in argon atmosphere. Recording started as soon as the HZ7Ar gas mixture [HZ:Ar=9.8:91.2 mol-% (Hokusan Co., pure gas) ] was passed over the catalyst. After 30 min, the linear temperature ramp started. By this procedure, the signal can be separated from the noise that comes from mixing the mixture gas with argon. A change of the gas mixture to HZ:NZ=2.11:97.89 mol-% (Takachiho Chem. Ind., research grade) did not affect the results. The X-ray diffraction pattern was obtained on a MXP-3 (Mac Sci. Co.) diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation. Samples for XRD measurement were prepared by reduction in flowing hydrogen at 670 K, cooling to 300 K in hydrogen atmosphere, and passivating in nitrogen for 1 h. The amount of chemisorbed carbon monoxide on a catalyst was determined by a conventional pulse technique at 300 K (AMI1, Altamira Co.). For this measurement, a number of pulses of carbon monoxide gas fed into the helium flow were passed through a freshly reduced catalyst and the amount of gas consumed was calculated from the thermal conductivity detector signal. A pulse size of 5 or 50 gl and a helium flow-rate of 20 ml/min were used. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Reaction of CFC-113 with hydrogen Various noble metal catalysts were screened for the reaction of CFC-113 with hydrogen. For these initial experiments, unmodified commercial catalysts with 5 wt.-% loading Pd, Rh, Ru and Pt/A1203 were used. The catalytic performances are listed in Table 1. The palladium catalyst exhibited high activity to give a mixture of 1,1,2-trifluoroethane (143) and 1,1-dichloro-2-fluoroethane (141a) with selectivities of 41 and 30%, respectively. In addition, a small amount of the desired product, 3FH, and a by-product, 1,2-dichlorotrifluoroethane (123a), was formed at 473 K. The formation of 123a should be avoided because of its low reactivity, as will be described in next section. The platinum catalyst gave preferentially a mixture of undesired products, 123a and ethene, accompanied by HE The rhodium catalyst was generally less active than palladium catalyst but showed a similar product distribution. The ruthenium catalyst gave 3170 and the undesired 123a. Therefore, the palladium catalyst was chosen to be modified with metal additives in order to improve the activity and selectivity towards 3FH and 3FCl in the reaction of CFC-113 with hydrogen. Pd/A1203 catalysts of 0.5 or 5 wt.-% loading were impregnated with 26 metals. All additives caused a decrease in activity, possibly due to partial coverage of the palladium by the metal additives. Among the metal additives tested, Na, Ca, La, Ce, Zr, V, Cr, Mo, W, R.

Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Au, Zn, Ga, or Te had a small effect on the selectivity, yielding less than 40% to 3FH+3FC1. However, the selectivities for the formation of 3FH and 3FC1 were markedly enhanced by the addition of certain metals such as Cu, Ag, Cd, Hg, In, Tl, Sn, Pb, Bi, which are found in the late Ib-IIIb group of the Periodic Table (Table 2) . The high selectivities of 3FCl + 31711 were maintained at more than 80%, even if the reaction temperature and the conversion changed. In particular, 3FH was formed with selectivities of 72, 80 and 86% over TI, Hg and Bi modified 5 wt.-% Pd/A1203, respectively, while a selectivity to 3FCl of 98, 70 and 90% was observed on TI, Sn and In modified 5 wt.-% Pd/ A1203. It is worth to note that the selectivity changed drastically from 3FH-rich to 3FC1rich with varying thallium content as shown in Table 2.

Ohnishi et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 113 (1994) 29-41 To further improve the yield and selectivity of either 3FH or 3FC1, the support effect was examined. Among the supporting materials tested for Pd-Bi and Pd-11 bimetallic catalysts, silica and active carbon appeared to promote activity and selectivity in the hydrodechlorination of CFC-113. Results are shown in Fig. 3, where yields of 90% of 31'H and over 90% of 3FC1 were obtained on 0.5Bi-2Pd/Si02 (A) and 2T1-5Pd/C (B), respectively. This high selectivity at the high conversion was maintained for at least 10 h.

Reaction of 3FCl and 123a with HZ Selectivity of 3FH or 3FC1 in the reaction of CFC-113 with hydrogen varied drastically with the contents of thallium in thallium modified Pd/A1203 catalysts. 3FC1 was preferentially produced on 1T1- and 2T1-5Pd/A1203, while the product was rich in 3FH over 0.5T15Pd/A1203 (Table 2). The same distinctive difference in the selectivity pattern was observed for the reaction of 3FCl with hydrogen. The catalytic performance in the reaction of 3FCl on xTl-5Pd/A1203 (x=0, 0.5, 2), IAg-5Pd/A1203 and 2Cu-5Pd/A1203are shown in Table 3 together with the results for the reactions of CFC-113 and 1,2-dichlorotrifiuoroethane (123a) . 3FCl hardly reacted with hydrogen on 2T1-5Pd/AI203, while it was readily hydrodechlorinated to produce 3FH on 0.5T1-5Pd/A1203. Silver and copper modified palladium catalysts, which afford both 3FH and 3FCl in the reaction of CFC-113 with hydrogen, selectively produced 3FH from 3FC1. On 5Pd/A1203, a part of 3FH was further hydrogenated to give haloethanes. From the low reactivities and different product distributions as compared with CFC-113 on every catalyst tested, it was suggested that 123a was not incorporated as an intermediate in the hydrodechlorination of CFC-113. Accordingly, it is reasonable to conclude that 3FCl is a key intermediate in hydrodechlorination of CFC-113 on thallium modified Pd/A1203 via the successive reactions, CFC-113) 3FCl) 3FH. Furthermore, the modifier plays a role in suppressing the hydrogenation activity of the palladium catalysts and in setting a barrier between 3FCl and 3FH and/or between 3FH and halo-ethane, thereby, promoting the selective hydrodechlorination of CFC-113 to 3FC1 or 3FH. 36 R.

The modification of the palladium catalyst by thallium, however, changes the feature of the IR spectrum dramatically. It now shows a prominent linear peak, as seen in Fig. 3A.

As the thallium content is increased further, the bridged peak fades away and the height of the linear peak likewise decreases. At TI/Pd=2, no carbon monoxide is adsorbed on the catalyst surface. The similar feature can be seen in Fig. 3B for xBi-5Pd/ A1203 (x=0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 1), where the bridged mode of adsorbed carbon monoxide molecules again transforms to the linear mode as the bismuth loading increases. The amount of carbon monoxide chemisorbed decreases as thallium or bismuth content in palladium catalyst increases as shown in Table 4. This suggests that the selective suppression of bridged carbon monoxide may be based on the site-blocking of thallium and bismuth on the palladium surface to prevent the multi-bonding chemisorption of carbon monoxide, as previously reported for Ag, Cu and Fe modified palladium catalysts [ 12-15 ] . 3.4. TPR and XRD measurements Bulk modification of Pd/A1203 with thallium and bismuth was studied by TPR and O measurements. The TPR patterns of xTl-5Pd/A1203 (x=0, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2) catalyst calcined at 673 K shows only one reduction peak, whose position depends strongly on the thallium loading as seen in Fig. 4A. On the 5 wt.-% Pd/A1203 catalyst, palladium was reduced around 280 K. This catalyst also absorbs hydrogen, as is revealed by a negative desorption peak of hydrogen at 345 K. The negative peak became small on a sample with Tl/Pd=0.2 and disappeared for samples with TI /Pd Z 0.5. As the thallium content increased to 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 in TI/Pd atomic ratio, the peak temperature for reduction was going up to 293, 327, 362 and 423 K, respectively, suggesting the formation of a Pd-TI alloy or an intermetallic A below BOOK 400 600 800 Temperature, K BI=2% BI/Pd=2 BI/Pd=0 400 600 800 Temperature, K Fig. 4.

In contrast to the samples calcined at 673 K, 2T1-5Pd/A1203 that had been calcined in dry air at 373 K gave two peaks of 364 and 489 K. Since neither 5 wt.-% Pd/ A1203 nor TI /A1203 gave the corresponding peaks and the peak temperature of reduction related strongly to the thallium content after the calcination at 673 K, these peaks were attributed to a Pd- and TI-rich phase. Further, the change of the peak position with calcination temperature may imply that the Pd- and/or TI-rich phase moves to interact, forming an intermetallic compound after being exposed to the high calcination temperature of 673 K. TPR spectra of xBi-5Pd/A1203 (x=0, 0.3, 0.5, 1, 2, -) in Fig. 4B appear to be very different from the ones of thallium modified Pd/A1203. The TPR spectrum of xBi-5Pd/ A1203 (x=0, 0.3, 0.5, 1) show a large positive and a negative peak at ca. 290 and 350 K, respectively, suggesting that most of the palladium did not form an alloy or intermetallic compound. The positions of additional TPR peaks at ca. 600 K and 800 K of xBi-5Pd/ A1203 (x = 0.5, 1, 2) are the same as 2Bi/A1203. This reveals that part of the bismuth stayed intact. Besides these peaks that are assigned to segregated palladium and bismuth metal, there are broad positive peaks between 300 and 500 K that may be attributable to the formation of Pd-Bi alloy or intermetallic compound on xBi-5Pd/A1203 (x=0.2, 0.5, 1, 2). The suppression of hydrogen absorption in palladium and, hence, the increase of the reduction temperature on the addition of modifier metals has been observed in many systems such as Ag, Cu, Sb modified palladium catalysts [ 16] . XRD shows broad diffraction peaks of palladium due to the small particle size ca. 40 A. Four peaks were identified on 5 wt.-% Pd/A1203 at 20=37.6, 39.6, 45.8, 67.2(see Fig. 5), which can be assigned to palladium hydride, Pd(1,1,1), Pd(2,0,0) and Pd(2,2,0), respectively. Palladium hydride is obviously formed during cooling treatment in hydrogen atmosphere. On 0.2T1-5Pd/A1203, almost the same spectrum was obtained as on 5 wt.-% Pd/A1203. However, it was observed in the case of 0.5T1- or 1T1-5Pd/A1203 that the peaks corresponding to Pd(1,1,1) and Pd(2,0,0) shifted to 38.5 and 44.9 respectively. This implies the formation of Pd-Tl alloy since substitution of palladium with thallium will cause the expansion of the lattice and, consequently, a shift of the diffraction peaks to smaller values of 20. Further increase of the thallium loading to TI/Pd=2 caused the peak at ca. 20=45to disappear and the development of peaks at ca. 20=30(not shown). TI/Pd.d ruvd.o.

Ohnishi et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 113 (1994) 29-41 39 Together with the observation of a single peak in the TPR spectrum, this may suggest the formation of an intermetallic compound between palladium and thallium in the bulk phase. 3.5. Thermodynamic parameters for effective modifiers Hydrodefluorination of CFC-113 is promoted on the unmodified palladium catalyst, as reflected in the formation of 1,1-dichloro-2-fluoroethane(141a), which has two fluorine atoms less per molecule than CFC-113. Thallium and bismuth modified palladium catalysts produced only traces of HF, which was deduced from the fact that no corrosion of the glass reactor was observed. Thus, another role of the modifier may be based on the effective suppression of the hydrodefluorination. As mentioned above, all metal modifiers which promote high 3FC1 + 3FH selectivities are located in late Ib-IIIb groups of the Periodic C CL \\F CL M M HCL ~di ~~. H M ~ Pd Pd~ HZ Fig. 6.

According to the hard and soft acids and bases principle (HSAB) [ 17 ] , the modifier metal may form a stronger bond with chlorine atoms on the reactant than with fluorine. Fig. 6 depicts the role of the modifier and a hypothetical catalytic cycle. Step 1 shows how the modifier metal preferentially pulls out the chlorine atom rather than a fluorine from the CFC. Step 2 describes the regeneration of the metal chloride thus formed. The ease of chloride formation over fluoride (step 1) may be estimated by the equilibrium constant of Eq. (1) (Kl), which can be calculated from thermodynamic data [ 18 ] . The reducibility of chloride (step 2) may be evaluated from the equilibrium constant of Eq. (2) (KZ). MF+ nHCI ~ MCl+ nHF (1) MCI\" +ZHZ =M+nHCI (2) Log KZ at 500 K was plotted against log K, at 500 K for all metals used as modifiers to the palladium catalyst except for molybdenum whose data was not available. The result is shown in Fig. 7, where symbols and 0 represent effective and not effective modifiers, respectively. The points for active elements fall all in the same region on this figure. Accordingly, another role of the modifier will be the suppression of hydrodefiuorination, which is realized by the easy chloride formation, and facile reduction of the chloride to metal. 4. Conclusions Results can be summarized as follows.( 1) Palladium catalysts modified with metals from groups IB-IIIB of the Periodic Table promote the selective hydrodechlorination to yield chlorotrifluoroethene (3FC1) or trifluoroethene (3FH). In particular, a thallium modified 5 wt.-% Pd/C catalyst (TI loading= 1 in TI/Pd atomic ratio) and a bismuth modified 2 wt.-% Pd/Si02 (Bi/Pd=0.5) gave 3FC1 and 3FH, respectively, with over 90% yield.(2) When the thallium content in the catalyst increased gradually from 0 to 2, the main reaction product shifted from haloethanes to 3FH and to 3170. (3) The same type of selectivity change was also observed for the reaction of 3FC1 with hydrogen. (4) It is concluded from (2) and (3) that the reaction route for the hydrodechlorination of CFC-113 is CFC113- 3FC1) 3FH and that the role of the modifier is to suppress the hydrogenation activity. (5) The equilibrium constant for chloride formation over fluoride was plotted against that for the stability of metal over chloride. All the good promoters were coming from the same region, indicating that another role of the modifiers will be the depression of hydrodefluorination activity. (6) TPR and O measurements of thallium and bismuth modified palladium catalysts reveal that at least a part of palladium forms an alloy or intermetallic compound with the modifiers. (7) IR measurement of carbon monoxide chemisorption on the thallium-modified palladium catalysts showed that the intensity of the bridged band substantially decreased while that of the linear band increased as the thallium modifier content increased, suggesting that the modifier partly covers the palladium surface, thus decreasing the ensemble size of the palladium atoms to prevent a multi-bonding chemisorption of carbon monoxide.

More than 80% selectivity in the hydrodechlorination of 1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane (CFC-113) has been observed over palladium catalysts containing selected metal additives such as Ag, Bi, Cd, Cu, Hg, In, Pb, Sn, Tl to chlorotrifluoroethene (3FCl) and trifluoroethene (3FH). In particular, a bismuth modified palladium catalyst supported on SiO2 and a thallium modified catalyst on active carbon provided 3FH and 3FC1 with more than 90% yield at 520-600 K. Kinetic studies suggest that the reaction route is CFC-113→ 3FC1→ 3FH and that the role of the metal additives is to suppress the hydrodechlorination of 3FC1 to 3FH or further hydrogenation of 3FH. The thermodynamic estimations imply that the modifier plays another role in the inhibition of hydrodefluorination. The IR studies of carbon monoxide chemisorption on the modified palladium catalysts show that the addition of bismuth or thallium leads to a drastic suppression of bridged carbon monoxide on palladium and to the enhancement of linear carbon monoxide. This shift indicates that the addition of the promoter results in the breaking the ensembles of palladium atoms. Further evidence for this mechanism comes from the temperature-programmed reduction spectra, where a reduction peak shifts to higher temperature. X-ray diffraction spectra, where a broad peak based on palladium shifted to low angle of 2θ by the addition of thallium, indicates the formation of Tl-Pd alloy or intermetallic compound.
