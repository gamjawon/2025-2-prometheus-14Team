Their influence on the catalytic activity for the isomerization of n-butane was analyzed in the presence of electron donor (H2) and electron acceptor (02, CO2) gases. A new reaction scheme accounts for the one electron properties of the sulfate-zirconia catalyst. Transition metal cations are postulated to enhance activity through d-orbital interaction. Cations with a complete d level inhibit activity, but the presence of electron acceptor molecules (O2 and CO2) in the reacting medium attenuated this deleterious effect. ~\", 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction Catalysts obtained by promotion of zirconia with sulfate have attracted the interest of scientists working on hydrocarbon conversion because of their excep- tional properties of conversion and selectivity. Pre- viously, many authors refer to the sulfated zirconia as having superacid properties [1-3]. Today, some researchers ascribe superacidity to BrOnsted or Lewis acid sites [4], while others doubt the alleged super- acidic properties of sulfated zirconia (SZ) [5-7]. Promotion of SZ with several transition metals increases the isomerization activity [4,8-10]. Adeeva et al. [11] reported no difference in acid strength *Corresponding author. Tel.: 54-42-533858; fax: 54-42-531068; e-mail: parera@fiqus.unl.edu.ar between SZ and Fe-Mn promoted SZ catalysts. They considered that neither SZ nor Fe-Mn promoted SZ are superacids. Wan et al. [12] proposed a bifunctional mechanism combining a metallic redox site and an acid site in close proximity to explain the difference in catalytic activity between SZ and Fe-Mn promoted SZ. Tabora and Davis [13] proposed that trace amounts of olefins may be produced from oxidative dehydrogenation on SZ. Previously, we reported that cations supported on SZ or an inert mechanically mixed with SZ increased the n-butane (n-C4) isomer- ization rate. Promotion was ascribed to dehydrogena- tion on metals or metal oxides producing C4 alkenes, which are readily isomerized. However, Cu dopants inhibit n-C4 isomerization. There was no explanation for this anomalous behaviour because after calcination Cu dopants produce copper oxides (CuO and Cu20) 0926-860X/98/$19.00 ,~);, 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

These compounds could promote alkene formation, and consequently enhance (but not inhibit) the catalytic activity. In summary, a consistent description of the active catalytic site in SZ is needed. This may lead to improvements in the formulation and performance of the catalyst. In this paper we have approached the problem of the activity of SZ catalysts differently. Rather than using analogies with other acid catalysts, we have related the behaviour of the sulfate promoted catalyst with known features of the undoped zirconia system. Zirconia acts as an acid, a base, a reductant and an oxidant [14]. Here we explore the possibility that SZ is an unusual redox catalyst, an idea already posed by other authors [15,16]. To further test this hypothesis, several new experiments were performed. These studied the effects of Group IB and liB cations in SZ on the isomerization of n-butane in the presence of H> 02, N2 or CO2. Our model emphasizes the presence of lattice vacancies, Zr3+ defective sites and conductivity in fluoritic ZrO2. To assess the importance of defective surface sites, experiments with pure zirconia treated with hydrogen and subsequently sulfated were also performed. 'CZ-HS' catalyst (CZ-HS-0.5, CZ-HS-1, CZ-HS-3). Transfer from the hydrogen to the solution was rapid, in order to avoid contact with atmospheric oxygen. 0.5% Cu/SO2--ZrO2, was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of SO] -Zr(OH)4 over 3 h with an aqueous solution of CuSO4.5H20 in concentration enough to obtain 0.5% Cu in the final catalyst. Drying and calcination before the catalytic test were similar to those performed on SO]--Zr(OH)4. This sample was identified as 'Cu/SZ'. 0.5% Cd/SO42--ZrO2, was prepared in the same way as (Cu/SO4 -ZrO2) using CdSO4.8H20 as Cd precursor. This sample was identified as 'Cd/SZ'. 0.5% Zn/SO2 -ZrO2 was prepared as above using ZnC12 as Zn precursor. This sample was identified as 'Zn/SZ'. 2.2. Materials H2SO4, CuSO4.5H20 and the other salts were Carlo Erba RPE; pure air, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, 5% O2/N2 mixture and hydrogen were provided by AGA. n-butane (99.5%) was provided by Matheson and chromatographic analysis indicated that only isobutane was the other constituent (0.5%) of the gas. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts Zr(OH)4 was precipitated from a ZrOC12 solution by adding NHaOH up to pH 10, according to [17]. After drying at 110, Zr(OH)4 was filled to incipient wetness with a volume of H2SO4 2 N corresponding to the pore volume plus a 10% excess (0.4 ml/g) over 3 h. The material was dried overnight at ll0 to form 'SO42--Zr(OH)4'. Before testing, the catalyst was calcined in an air flow at 620 for 3 h in the reactor. This sample was identified as 'SZ'. A portion of Zr(OH)4 was calcined at 600 for 3 h in air and produced a mostly monoclinic identified as 'CZ'. A portion of the CZ was sulfated by wet impregnation (WI), dipping the solid in a H2SO4 1 N solution for 2 h, producing the 'CZ-WI' catalyst. A second portion of the CZ was calcined in hydrogen at 550 for 30 min, 1 and 3 h, and sulfated by wet impregnation in 1 N H2SO4, for 2 h producing the 2.3. Textural properties Specific surface area (Sg), pore volume (Vg) and pore size distributions were calculated from nitrogen adsorption isotherms measured in a volumetric equip- ment provided by Micromeritics. 2.4. XRD measurements The XRD measurements were performed on a Rich- Seifert Iso-Debyeflex 2002 diffractometer with Cu Kc~ radiation of 1.5418 A. The spectra were recorded between 20=20and 20=80and scanning at a rate of 1.2rain. 2.5. Catalytic test n-C4 isomerization was used as a test reaction. A system operating in continuous flow was used for the testing of the SZ catalysts, either doped or undoped, in order to compare with previous results [10]. The reaction was performed at atmospheric pressure using C.R. Vera et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 167 (1998) 75-84 77 an isothermal fixed bed quartz reactor. Conditions of the catalytic test were: temperature=200, WHSV=0.8 (g n-Ca/g cat h), mass of catalyst 0.5 g, the feed was n-C4 diluted (6 mol of diluent N2, CO2, air, 5% 02/N2 mixture or H2 per mol of n-C4). Reac- tion products were analyzed by on-line chromatogra- phy with a 6 m long, 1/8\" diameter column packed with 25% dimethylsulfolane on Chromosorb R Both catalytic activity (total conversion) and selectivity to i- C4 were calculated from the chromatograms. In the case of the calcined catalysts CZ which were promoted in the crystalline state the activity was expected to be low so they were tested using a pulse technique, in order to collect instantaneous time-on- stream data. Before the reaction all the samples were activated in a flow of air at 620 for 1 h. The reaction temperature was 300 and pure n-Ca was used. Each pulse had a volume of 1 ml which was sent to a quartz microreactor by nitrogen and a sampling valve. Sam- ples of 300 mg of the catalyst were used all throughout the experiments. The microreactor had an internal diameter of 5 mm and a length of 20 cm; the catalyst was supported over a glass wool plug situated in the middle of the tube. Inlet and outlet connections were made in 1/16\" tubing, to diminish axial diffusion. 3. Results Table l shows crystal and textural properties of samples calcined at 620. After calcination, SZ had a tetragonal and CZ a monoclinic crystal habit. All the cation-doped samples showed essentially the same XRD pattern. Sulfate promotion stabilized the tetragonal phase of zirconia and the cation doping did not modify this situation. Similarly, except for the CZ Table 1 Crystal and textural properties of samples calcined at 620:'C Sample Crystalline phase Sg (BET) m2/g Vg cm3/g CZ M>T 77 0.895 SZ T 120 0.149 Zn/SZ T 109 0. ! 35 Cu/SZ T 114 0.14 Cd/SZ T 124 0.163 T: tetragonal phase; M: monoclinic phase; Sg: specific surface area; Vg: pore volume. 10 6 .o_ > t- o 4 0 2 0 , I ~ I ~ I 20 40 60 80 Time, min.

Fig. 1 shows the total conversion of n-C4 (catalytic activity) plotted as a function of time-on-stream for undoped SZ and SZ doped with Cu, Zn and Cd, when N2 is used as a diluent. As it can be seen, the addition of these cations reduced conversion over SZ. If we accept that the promoting effect observed with the other transition metal cations (Pt, Ni, Co, W, Fe, Cr) on the catalytic activity of SZ is caused by formation of alkenes through dehydrogenation, the inhibition produced by Cu, Zn and Cd, has no explanation. Moreover even when Cu, Zn and Cd, could not promote alkene formation, the effect on catalytic activity of SZ should be null, not an inhibition. Table 2 shows the initial catalytic activity results of the SZ catalysts. It can be seen that the deleterious effect of Zn, Cu and Cd in the SZ support can be diminished in the presence of O2 or CO2. N2 had no effect other than dilution. H2 depressed catalytic activity. The results corresponding to the CZ catalysts pro- moted in the crystalline state are plotted in Fig. 2. Data for the SZ catalyst (also in pulse mode) are included for comparison. Initial conversion values are also included in Table 2. It can be seen that the 78 C.R.

It was found that longer hydrogen treatments (3 h) did not produce a higher catalytic activity, a fact that could be related to the formation of hydrides or sintering. In a sense, CZ catalysts seemed to behave as a reduction semicon- ductor catalyst [18], where active centres are increased upon hydrogen treatment and non-stoichiometry induction. SZ was the most active catalyst, a fact related to its higher specific surface area (CZ-HS had areas equal to or lower than 60 mZ/g after the hydro- genation treatment) or to a higher number of active sites per unit area produced by the method of promo- tion in the amorphous state. There is a difference in the initial activity levels when measured by the pulse or the continuous flow system (SZ catalyst) because in the continuous flow test the first sampling is done at 5 min time-on-stream after flow rates are stabilized, and many equivalent pulses have already reacted. 4. Discussion 4.1. Redox properties and a new model for SO2 -Zr02 activity Farcasiu et al. [19] have argued that SO] -ZrQ catalysts have oxidizing properties and that the inter- mediates in the transformation of hydrocarbons are C.R.

Scheme of the Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism [20]. cations formed by one electron abstraction. The pos- ing of a redox scheme in any step of the isomerization of n-butane should first take into account the possi- bility of an oxidation redox cycle on the active sites of SO] -ZrO2. The overall scheme for the oxidation of a hydrocarbon can often be modeled upon that sug- gested by Mars and van Krevelen [20] for the oxida- tion of naphthalene, depicted by the cycle of Fig. 3. The Mars-van Krevelen scheme poses an appealing oxidation-reduction cycle on SO]--ZrO2 catalysts. It entails sites with different oxidation states and the transport of charge and oxygen between these sites. Two cations are expected to be found in ZrO2, Zr4+ and Zr3+. Zr3+ has been detected on the surface of active SZ catalysts by EPR [21]. Hydrogenation enhances catalytic activity as shown in Table 2 and Fig. 2 for CZ catalysts, indicating that reduced sites are necessary for isomerization of n-C4. Hydrogena- tion may produce Zr3+ and anionic vacancies. In bulk ZrO2, the transferred electron may be delocalized in the vacancy (i) or inserted to the d orbital ofZr (ii). On the surface, elimination of surface oxo species linked to Zr cations is more likely to produce only Zr3+ surface species (iii).

(i) Electronic conduction: zirconia is a n-type oxide and may display n-type conductivity [22] like other non-stoichiometric oxides and sulfides (ZnO, Cu20, NiO, ZnS). This feature arises from the loss of lattice oxygen which would produce oxygen vacan- cies and also cationic sites with defective low oxidation states. The excess negative charge may move from one site to another, yielding n-type conductivity. (ii) Ionic conduction: in zirconia, electrolytic conduction of lattice oxygen is possible in its fluoritic phases, where anionic conduction is carried along through the oxygen vacancies (Schottky defects) present in the crystalline lattice. Oxygen 02 species move from one occupied site to a vacant one giving rise to conduction. In zirconia with a fluoritic structure stabilized with foreign dopant cations, this mode of conduction predominates under most condi- tions [22,23]. For surface doped sulfate-zirconia catalysts, the question arises of the form and influence of conduc- tion over its catalytic activity. While Zr3+ has been detected on SZ [21,24], the presence of oxygen vacan- cies is also a widely known feature of tetragonal zirconia, the predominant phase of crystalline SZ catalysts [25]. For amorphous promoted sulfated zirconia cata- lysts, both the existence of oxygen vacancies and Zr3+ groups can be explained by the stabilizing effect of the sulfate anion. During the calcination of the sulfated Zr hydroxide, the sulfate could act as a stabilizer of oxygen vacancies, possibly by a charge compensating mechanism. Srinivasan et al. [26] pre- sented evidence to show that surface sites adsorbing oxygen at low temperatures (298-500 K) are respon- sible for causing the tetragonal to monoclinic trans- formation at low temperatures. The incorporation of sulfate covers these sites and inhibits the tetragonal to monoclinic transformation. The presence of oxygen vacancies could also stabilize the tetragonal crystal- line phase [25] and lower the oxidation state of some of the surface cations, which could become Zr3+ centers. Osendi et al. [27] have argued that initial nucleation of tetragonal zirconia is favored by anionic vacancies with trapped electrons. The existence of a zra+-zr+3 couple, which can interact through the conduction of lattice oxygen or electrons, brings up the possibility of the existence of 80 C.R. Vera et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 167 (1998) 75-84 an oxidation-reduction steps involved in the general reaction network of the transformation of light paraf- fins on SO4 -ZrO2. Unlike the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism we are interested in the possibility of redox processes with no insertion of oxygen, just for the formation of cationic oxidized intermediates. The oxidizing (Zr4+) and reducing (Zr3+) sites are supposed to be influenced by other surface species, which are the result of the promotion and activation processes. Highly electronegative sulfate groups are expected to enhance the oxidizing ability of the Zr4+ cation. Dioxygen, which is present during the activa- tion treatments at high temperatures before the reac- tion and displays a high electronic affinity, is expected to be chemisorbed on Zr3+ sites, as suggested by Chen et al. [21]: Zr3+ + 02 ~ Zr4+ + 02 (iv) A possible global reaction mechanism of n-butane isomerization over SO2--ZrO2, which takes into account redox phenomena can now be outlined. Dehydrogenation: (a) Call10 + Zr4+ + SO4- ---+ Call9 4- Zr3+ 4- SO4H (e transfer and H abstraction) (b) C4H9 4- Zr4+ 4- SO42 -4 C4H8 + Zr3+ + SOaH- (e transfer and H abstraction) Sulfate groups rather than lattice oxygen have been proposed as hydrogen acceptors because they are abundant and highly nucleophilic surface species. Relying on IR spectroscopic data, Morterra et al. [29] have proposed that protons which are associated to sulfonic species are present on highly dehydrated SZ. The stabilization of hydrogen can be performed on two adjacent sulfate groups (as written above) or on the same sulfate group. With (a) and (b) only a non-catalytic first stage can be posed, which relies on the availability of SO4 / Zra+ sites to produce an initial pool of olefins. In order to complete a catalytic cycle, Zr3+ should be reox- idized, e.g. as in (c): (c) 2Zr3+ + 2SO4H ~ 2Zr4+ 4- 2SO~- + H2 (Zr reoxidation and hydrogen evolution) Hydrogen evolution during isomerization of n-butane has not been reported. Furthermore, (a)-(b)-(c) is a cycle with the following result: C4Hlo ++ C4H8 + H2 K -- l0 4 at 300: AG't! = 100 kJ/mol The former should be coupled to a reaction with a hydrogen acceptor in order to have a global negative change in Gibbs free energy. Water has a Go of -204 kJ/mol and can be formed from surface oxygen or from oxygen of the sulfate group. The latter is more likely if hydrogen is stabilized on these sites: (c') 2Zr3++2SO4H -+2Zr4++SO~ +SO42 +H20 An assessment of the changes in the oxidation state of sulfur during n-butane isomerization has been attempted though they are hardly detectable by XPS [10]. Carbenium ion formation: it may be formed in two possible ways: (d) C4H9 + Zr4+ ---+ C4H~ -- Zr3- (single electronic transfer) (e) SO4H 4-C4H8 -~ SO4 4-C4H+ (protonation of a C4 olefin) The further oxidation of the Call9 radical by one electron transfer to a Zr cation (d) seems specially attractive since the steps (a) and (d) may proceed on two different adjacent Zr atoms or in one with two stages, thus lowering the energetic barrier of the individual step, which may be too high for a full hydride abstraction (f) on one step at one Zr atom: homolytic dissociation of C-H bond: ~430 kJ/mol [30]; heterolytic dissociation (butane): 970-1110 kJ/ tool [31]). (f) C4H,0 + SO42 /Zr4+ -+ C4H~ + [SO4-/zra~]H (hydride abstraction) The energy involved in the reduction of Zr+4 may be enough to drive steps (a), (b) and (d) while the stabilization of the adsorbed intermediates may be achieved by delocalization of the charge through the conductive matrix of fluoritic zirconia. Isomerization: for the on-going development of the isomerization reaction, the olefins (C4Hs) produced in the first stages could interact with adsorbed carbenium ions (CgH+), a mechanism which detailed description can be found elsewhere [32].

This species would be a branched one since the insertion of the olefin onto secondary or tertiary carbenium ions is thermodynamically favored. Further rearrangement of this intermediate in the adsorbed state may proceed via methyl shifts, until i-butylic chains are formed. The breaking of the intermediate would yield another olefin and an/-butyl carbenium ion (g). Finally, hydride transfer from a linear alkane would yield/-butane and another carbenium ion (h).

For example, the electron transfer to a Zr+4 cation with a nearby 02 anion may lead to an unstable site with a high electron density, which may be stabilized by hopping of the 02- to an adjacent ~acancy.

Without taking into account commonly considered reaction paths which lead to cracking, disproportion and coking, the presence of oxygenated products during the transformation of hydrocarbons over sulfate zirconia [28] may indicate that the insertion of chemisorbed or lattice oxygen into the reactants is a possible reaction. Also the evolution of SO2 [ 16] indicates that surface sulfate groups can be eliminated by reduction. 4.2. Role of transition metal cation promoters With the previous rationalization in mind we will try to explain the results found in the runs with SZ promoted with transition element cations. First, it must be recalled that the mechanism is supposed to be initiated by a one-electron transfer from the adsorbed hydrocarbon to the Zr4+ site. In this sense, the addition of cationic promoters may act in two ways: (i) the cations may act as independent electron acceptors; (ii) the cations may act as electron accep- tors polarizing the lattice network and enhancing the oxidizing properties of the Zr4+ site. (iii) Taking a whole redox cycle into account another role may be the supply of orbitals for e- transfer, taking the role of the Zr3+ in the previous discussion. Table 2 summarizes the results of initial conversion values of undoped SZ and SZ doped with Pt, Ni, W, Co, Fe and Cr which were previously reported in Ref. [10]. In addition, initial conversion values of SZ doped with Cu, Zn and Cd using different reacting atmospheres of different composition, are shown. For the catalysts reacting with pure n-C4, the sequence with an ordering of decreasing activity was: Pt>Ni>>W>Co>>Cr>Fe>>SZ>Cu~Zn~Cd. If we dis- card the elements with dm configuration (groups IB, IIB), i.e. Cu, Zn and Cd, the other elements adjust almost perfectly to some rules: (i) elements in the same row of the periodic table are (roughly) ranked by atomic number (Ni>Co>Fe~Cr); (ii) elements in the same column are also ranked by atomic number (Pt>Ni, W>Cr). The electronic properties that also follow these trends are the effective nuclear charge (Z*), the electronic affinity (EA) and the electronega- tivity. The electronegativity and the EA closely depend on Z*, since the higher Z* the easier is to accomodate an incoming electron [34]. Some values of EA for the elements were included in Table 2. Therefore the enhancing effect of most of the cations can be rationalized with their electron with- drawing tendency, which would be higher for the heavier cations. In the case of Cu, Zn and Cd, the inhibiting effect can be related to the state of their d orbitals. Zr+4 is a do cation with empty d orbitals. Fe, Cr, W, Co, Ni, and Pt cations have 8 or less d electrons and then have multiple unpaired electrons in their d level. Zn+z, Cu+ and Cd+2 have their d level com- pletely filled while Cu+2 has only one d electron unpaired. Two possibilities may be related to the inhibiting effect of the latter cations. Either a high degree of availability of empty or half-filled d orbitals is necessary for the adsorption of the alkane inter- 82 C.R. Vera et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 167 (1998) 75 84 mediate on the active site, or there is a necessary interaction between d-electrons and empty d orbitals of the Zr species and the foreign cations. One difficulty for the posing of a precise correlation in terms of redox potentials, is the lack of information on the oxidation states of the dopants on the catalyst and the strength of their interaction with the zirconia lattice. Anyway, some facts can be deduced from simplifying assumptions. We may first pose a ionic model of binding for the ZrO2 lattice and for some of the cations studied. The overlaps in 3d oxides (Fe, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) are recognized to be small [35] and the M-O bond can be treated as a ionic one, but this simplyfing assumption should not be used for highly populated 4d oxides (Cd) or heavier 5d cations (W, Pt). The energy associated with the transition Mn+ -+ M(n l)+ (AE) can now be determined from the dif- ference in lattice energies of Mn+ and M(n 1)+ (AU) and the energy of formation of M(n l)+ from M\"+, where the latter can be determined from the corre- sponding ionization energy (IE, gas phase). AU can be thought of being composed of two components (AUAucv). AUis a function of the structure, the charge of anions and cations and the distance (r between them (Born-Landd equation). AUcf would account for crystal field effects. Klier [35] has shown that in isovalent and isostructural series of 3d oxides (where AUwould be a smooth monotonous function of rand hence of atomic number) the binding energy of oxides followed the variations in IE. He also found that other oxidation-reduction potentials (aqueous media redox potential, free energy of oxidation of lower to higher oxides) varied with a similar pattern, a confirmation of the fact that in weak crystal fields, redox potentials follow the dominant variations of ionization potentials corrected by smaller but not negligible variations of AEFc. In our case crystal field effects are expected to be even smaller. Doping cations, supposedly occupying surface sites would lack full coordination. Also the cubic symmetry of fluoritic zirconia would produce a low CFSE (if compared to octahedral symmetry). Therefore, in the case of isovalent cations their redox potentials can be compared by comparing values of IE. Some selected values of IE are included in Table 3 for Zr and 3d cations, where cations are listed in an order of increasing catalytic activity (see Table 2). For the M3+-+M2+ transition the IE and catalytic activity Table 3 Energy involved in the electron transfer reaction of some transition element cations. Taken from the values of I'l~h gas phase ionization energies of each element [34] Element Energy [kJ/mol] Zr\" a-+Zr+3 3310 Fe+4__.+Fe -3 5290 Cr ~ 4~+Cr-3 4740 Co+4~Co+3 4950 Ni+4~+Ni+3 5300 Fe+3 +Fe 2960 Cr+3~Cr+2 2990 Co-a~Co~2 3230 Ni-3_+Ni 3390 orderings coincide and in the case of the M4+----+M3+ transition there is an exception in the case of Fe. Values for Zn and Cu are not included since M4+ and M3+ cations of these elements are not stable. The much lower IE involved in a Mz+---+M1+ transition (1630-1960 kJ/mol for Zn, Cu and Cd [34]) may be related to their null promoting activity. With regards to the influence of other molecules than n-butane present in the reaction medium, the results fit well with the importance of the one electron transfer at an oxidizing site. 02 and CO2 are electron acceptors, while H2 is an electron donor (like CO, a known poison of SZ catalyst). Dioxygen has two unpaired electrons and addition of an electron to form O2 produces a release of energy (exothermic). Nitro- gen cannot be thought of as an electron donor. If we suppose that a limiting step in the transformation of hydrocarbons over sulfate-zirconia is the abstraction of electrons at the active site, molecules such as CO, water and ammonia would act as inhibitors of the catalytic activity, since they would tend to be strongly chemisorbed on the active site. The same would be applied to H2, but to a lower extent. No inhibiting effect should be seen in the case of N2, C02 and 02. In the case of the cations of Zn, Cu and Cd, if we compare the effect of N2 with the effect of 02, air and CO2, we can see a beneficial effect when electron acceptor molecules (02, CO2) are present. We can think of 02 and CO2 as being adsorbed on cationic sites, and increasing the oxidation number and hence the oxidizing property of the cation: 02 + Mn+ ---+ 02 + M(n+~)+ C.R. Vera et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 167 (1998) 75-84 83 The process may involve the removal of one electron from the d shell, thus leaving unpaired d electrons which may take part in the reactive path of the hydrocarbon. We can finally discuss the inconvenience of other explanations. The posing of the dopant cations as providing dehydrogenating properties cannot explain the behaviour of the elements with d9-dconfigura- tion. If the cations remain on the surface as sulfates they cannot be thought of as acting as independent acid centers either. Tanabe et al. [36] have studied the acidity of sulfates of transition elements and have found that their acidity and catalytic activity decreases to null values after the treatment at high temperatures, a fact related to the hydration state of the catalysts. Another possibility is to consider the acidity of the monoatomic cations (a two-electron property) and try to correlate it with the catalytic activity found in our experiments. Table 4 contains the values of absolute acidity of the different cations employed. It has been found that the catalytic activity of cations present in Table 4 Absolute acidity of monoatomic cations (Ei) of metals of the transition series Cations Absolute acidity ~ ei (eV) Type (a) Zr4+ 19.8 W+6 29.4 Type (b) Pt-2 12.04 b Ni.2 11.76 W+4 18.8 Co+2 11.5 Cr+2 10.9 Cr+3 16.4 Fe+2 10.82 Fe+3 16.2 b Cu-2 11.8 Type (c) Cu~ 1 6.94 Zn ~2 11.93 Cd+2 10.32 a As read from Ref.

Type (c) dl4j~, soft acid, ei=0.862 (li/zi-l.42). li must be expressed in eV to be used in the previous formulae. different compounds, in many reactions, can be cor- related fairly well with their absolute acidity values. For example, metal oxides in the oxidation of cumene and the decomposition of cumene hydroperoxide, their chlorides and sulfates for the reaction of dehy- drochlorination of hydrocarbons, their cations (loaded onto zeolite X) for the formation of cumene, and many others [37]. Some correlation in the case of Pt, Ni, Co, Cr and Fe can be found if we consider the M+2 cations of this series. However, Zn and Cd have high values of acidity and they did not promote the activity of SZ and a restriction for an acid-base mechanism based on the availability of d-electrons (which could discard Zn2+ and Cd2+ as possible acid centres) is harder to find in this case. 1. 2. . 4. Conclusions The beneficial role of the cations of metals of the transition series can be related to their availability of electrons in a partially filled external d-shell. Activity enhancement seemingly correlates with the electron affinity of the cations. d9 and d1cations (Cu, Zn, Cd) have a detrimental effect on the activity of SO4 -ZrO2 catalysts and behave as poisons of the activity. For cations of the IB and IIB groups some bene- ficial effect is brought by the presence of electron acceptor molecules, like O2 and CO2 which may increase their oxidation state by forming adsorbed O2 and CO2 species. A model can be set up which explains the activity of SO4--ZrO2 in terms of redox properties. This model takes into account known properties of the catalyst not recalled before, like the presence of Zr3+ sites and a matrix with oxygen vacancies, which allow the transfer of charge between sites.
