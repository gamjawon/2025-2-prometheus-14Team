The Ru/Sn heterobimetallic complexes CpRu(PPh3)2(SnCl3) (1), (Ind)Ru(PPh3)2(SnCl3) (2) and CpRu(TPPMS)2(SnCl3) (3) were studied as homogeneous catalysts for the electrooxidation of methanol to dimethoxymethane (DMM) and methyl formate (MF). Complexes 1, 2 and 3 exhibited significantly higher turnover numbers and current efficiencies than the corresponding mononuclear complexes CpRu(PPh3)2Cl (4) and CpRu(TPPMS)2Cl (5). The highest current efficiency (92.4%) and selectivity (100%) for DMM formation were obtained from the electrooxidation of methanol with complex 3. Graphical abstract The Ru(II) half sandwich complexes CpRu(PPh3)2(SnCl3) (1), (Ind)Ru(PPh3)2(SnCl3) (2) and CpRu(TPPMS)2(SnCl3) (3) are catalysts for the selective partial electrooxidation of methanol to dimethoxymethane. Keywords Methanol oxidation Electrocatalysis Ru catalysts 1 Introduction The selective oxidation of methanol has been of interest as a route to several important organic chemicals such as formaldehyde [1], dimethoxymethane (DMM) [2–5] and methyl formate (MF) [6]. Direct conversion of methanol to DMM by heterogeneous catalysis [2–5] has been recently investigated as a possible replacement for the two-step process involving oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde followed by the condensation of the methanol/formaldehyde mixtures to yield DMM. Rhenium oxides [2,3] and heteropolyacids with Keggin structures [4,5] have been reported to catalyze the selective oxidation of methanol vapor to DMM, typically at temperatures above 400K. Among these catalysts, SbRe2O6 [2,3] has the highest selectivity for DMM, converting 6.5% of the methanol feed at 573K with a selectivity as high as 92.5%. Electrooxidation of methanol typically yields a complex mixture of products (Scheme 1 ), with the major product and selectivity dependent upon the reaction conditions [7–10]. Product distributions have been determined in conjunction with studies on direct methanol fuel cells [7,9–16], using Pt black [7,11,12], Pt/Ru [11,12] and Pt/Nafion (Pt-SPE) [9,10,13] anodes. The general trend is that the absence of water and lower methanol concentrations favor formaldehyde formation, with yields of DMM rising as the concentration of methanol increases. The presence of water favors formation of MF and/or complete oxidation to CO2. We previously reported Ru/Pt, Ru/Pd and Ru/Au heterobimetallic catalysts for the electrooxidation of methanol [17–19]. The non-Ru metal center was shown to improve the catalytic properties of these complexes as compared to the mononuclear model compound CpRu(η2-dppm)Cl. Related beneficial effects of a Lewis acidic tin center in a thermal reaction had previously been reported for CpRu(PPh3)2(SnCl3) (1), which selectively oxidizes methanol to methyl acetate at elevated temperatures [20,21]. In order to explore the possible role of the second metal center as a Lewis acidic site, the Ru/Sn complexes CpRu(PPh3)2(SnCl3) (1), (Ind)Ru(PPh3)2(SnCl3) (2) and CpRu(TPPMS)2(SnCl3) (3) were investigated as catalysts for the electrooxidation of methanol [21]. We now report the selective electrooxidation of methanol to DMM using Ru/Sn complexes 1–3 as catalysts. 2 Experimental 2.1 General considerations Standard Schlenk/vacuum techniques were used throughout. All NMR solvents were degassed via three freeze–pump–thaw cycles and stored over 4Å molecular sieves. 1H and 31P NMR spectra are referenced to the residual proton in the deuterated solvent and to 85% H3PO4, respectively. High-resolution mass spectrometry was performed by the University of Florida analytical service. CpRu(PPh3)2Cl [22], (Ind)Ru(PPh3)2(SnCl3) [23] and CpRu(PPh3)2(SnCl3) [21] were prepared as previously described. TPPMS was prepared using a slight modification of the published procedure [24]. Tetra-n-butylammonium triflate (TBAT) and RuCl3·xH2O were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. (Ind)Ru(PPh3)2Cl was purchased from Strem Chemicals. All other starting materials were purchased in reagent grade purity and used without further purification. Electrochemical experiments were performed at ambient temperature in a glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere using an EG&G PAR model 263A potentiostat/galvanostat. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed with a normal three-electrode configuration consisting of a glassy carbon working electrode (3mm diameter), a Pt flag counterelectrode and a Ag/Ag+ reference electrode. For experiments performed in 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) or methanol, the reference electrode consisted of an acetonitrile or methanol solution, respectively, containing freshly prepared 0.01M AgNO3 and 0.1M TBAT along with a silver wire. The Ag+ solution and silver wire were contained in a 75mm glass tube fitted at the bottom with a Vycor tip. Constant potential electrolysis was carried out with similar equipment except for the working electrode being replaced with a vitreous carbon electrode. All potentials are reported versus NHE and are not corrected for the junction potential of the Ag/Ag+ reference electrode. The E 0 values for the ferrocenium/ferrocene couple in 0.7M TBAT/DCE and 0.1M TBAT/MeOH were +0.50 and +0.795V, respectively. Electrolysis products were analyzed by gas chromatography on a Shimadzu GC-17A chromatograph containing a 15m×0.32mm column of AT-WAX (Alltech, 0.5μm film) on fused silica. The column was attached to the injection port with a neutral 5m×0.32mm AT-WAX deactivated guard column. The electrolysis products were quantitatively determined with the use of n-heptane as an internal standard. Products were identified by comparison to authentic samples. 2.2 Synthesis of the Ru–TPPMS complexes 2.2.1 CpRu(TPPMS)2Cl (5) In a 250mL flask, CpRu(PPh3)2Cl (1.0g, 1.4mmol) and TPPMS (0.89g, 2.3mmol) in 100mL of toluene were refluxed under N2 for 2 days. The resulting orange solid was then collected on a medium frit, washed with approximately 200mL of diethyl ether and dried under vacuum at 80°C. Yield: 0.97g, 90%. 1H NMR (DMSO-d6): δ 7.72–7.52 (m, 4H), 7.25–7.08 (m, 24H), 4.07 (s, 5H, Cp) ppm. 31P NMR (DMSO-d6): δ 40.1 (s, PPh3) ppm. HRMS (FAB): calc. for C41H37O8Na2ClP2RuS2 m/z 932.0325 [MH+ −Cl]; found 932.0313. Anal. Calc. for C41H37O8Na2ClP2RuS2: C, 50.96; H, 3.86. Found: C, 50.71; H, 3.68. 2.2.2 CpRu(TPPMS)2(SnCl3) (3) CpRu(TPPMS)2Cl (0.71g, 0.76mmol) and SnCl2 (0.17g, 0.89mmol) in 25mL ethanol were stirred under N2 at room temperature overnight. The solution was then evaporated to dryness and the resulting yellow solid recrystallized from ethanol/diethyl ether. Yield: 0.73g, 85%. 1H NMR (CD3OD): δ 7.86–7.70 (m, 4H), 7.35–7.08 (m, 24H), 4.65 (s, 5H, Cp) ppm. 31P NMR (CD3OD): δ 46.0 (s, PPh3) ppm. Anal. Calc. for C41H37O8Na2Cl3P2RuS2Sn: C, 42.60; H, 3.23. Found: C, 42.87; H, 3.07. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis of CpRu(TPPMS)2Cl (5) and CpRu(TPPMS)2(SnCl3) (3) In our hands, the literature procedure for the synthesis of 5 [25] yielded complex reaction mixtures in which unreacted triphenylphosphine monosulfonate (TPPMS) and TPPMS oxide were the only identifiable compounds. Samples of 5 were instead prepared by an alternate route involving displacement of PPh3 from complex 4 with TPPMS. Heterogeneous reaction between 4 and TPPMS in refluxing toluene yielded 5 as an orange, moderately air stable solid. The 31P NMR spectrum of 5 is very similar to that of 4, consisting of a singlet at 40ppm. The Ru/Sn complex 3 was prepared in an analogous manner to 1 [21] by reacting 5 with a slight excess of SnCl2 in refluxing ethanol. The resulting yellow solid is moderately stable in air and in solutions of methanol and acetonitrile, but decomposes rapidly when dissolved in water. As expected from the 31P{1H} NMR spectrum of CpRu(PPh3)2(SnCl3) [21], the 31P NMR spectrum of 3 consists of one singlet at 46ppm. 3.2 Cyclic voltammetry of 1–5 The cyclic voltammograms of complexes 1–5 each display a single oxidation wave in the potential range of 0.50–1.60V. This oxidation process has previously been assigned for CpRu(PPh3)2Cl [26] and (Ind)Ru(PPh3)2Cl [27] (Table 1 ) as the reversible one electron oxidation of the Ru metal center. Based on this precedent, the oxidation waves observed for 1–5 have been assigned to the Ru(II/III) couple. When analyzed in DCE, the one electron oxidation of complex 4 (Fig. 1 ) at 0.82V and complex 5 at 0.89V are chemically reversible with i pa/i pc ≈1 (Table 1). When small amounts of methanol are added to the DCE solutions, no significant change is observed in the cyclic voltammograms of 4 and 5 at potentials less than 1.60V. The CV of 1 in DCE exhibits a reversible Ru(II/III) couple at 1.44V (Fig. 2 ). The Ru(II/III) couple is shifted by approximately 600mV positive with respect to the corresponding Ru(II/III) wave of CpRu(PPh3)2Cl (4). This positive shift is consistent with the electron-withdrawing SnCl3 − ligand rendering the Ru center of 1 electron-poor relative to that of complex 4. Sn(II) is not redox active within the solvent window (−0.50 to 2.5V versus NHE) for these experiments. In the presence of methanol, there is a significant increase in the current that coincides with the oxidation of the Ru metal center (Fig. 2). This effect is indicative of an electrocatalytic oxidation process. The CV of 2 is very similar to that of complex 1, exhibiting a reversible Ru(II/III) couple in DCE (Table 1). The Ru(II/III) couple, however, at 1.34V is 100mV negative with respect to the analogous Ru(II/III) couple of complex 1. This shifting of the II/III couple [27] is due to additional electron density associated with the indenyl ligand. The current rise from electrooxidation of methanol by 2 also coincides with its Ru(II/III) redox wave, as evidenced by a significant increase in the current at 1.34V in the presence of methanol. The CV of 3 exhibits a single irreversible wave in DCE at 1.58V (Table 1). This irreversible redox wave has been assigned to the oxidation of the metal center from Ru(II) to Ru(III). Cyclic voltammetry of 3 in DCE exhibits a significant increase in the catalytic current at the Ru(II/III) wave when methanol is introduced. A similar catalytic effect was observed for 1 and 2. 3.3 Bulk electrolysis of methanol Complexes 1–5 all exhibited some catalytic activity for the electrooxidation of methanol in the potential range of 1.55–1.70V in DCE or 1.25–1.40V in neat methanol (Table 2 ). The bimetallic complexes 1–3 are more active, exhibiting greater TON and current efficiencies than the corresponding RuCl complexes 4 and 5. Control experiments in the absence of catalyst did not result in the formation of detectable quantities of oxidation products when either DCE (1.70V) or methanol (1.40V) was used as the solvent. The oxidation of methanol to DMM and MF is therefore facilitated by the oxidized Ru species. The formation of DMM and MF under these conditions contrasts with the thermal reaction of methanol with CpRu(PPh3)2(SnCl3) [20,21], where methyl acetate was the only product isolated. As previously discussed, the cyclic voltammograms of complexes 1–3 exhibit a significant current increase at the Ru(II/III) couple in the presence of methanol. In contrast, the simple Ru species 4 and 5 exhibit no significant change at the Ru(II/III) wave when methanol is introduced. Bulk electrolyses of the sulfonated species complexes 3 and 5 were performed in methanol as the solvent. As expected, when the electrolysis is performed in methanol instead of DCE, there is a significant increase in the current efficiency and TON (Table 2). This increase is attributed to the improved electron transfer kinetics and to the higher concentration of methanol substrate when it is also the solvent. To probe the effect of the oxidation potential on the electrooxidation process, the catalytic activities of all the complexes were investigated at two potentials. The electrooxidation of methanol in DCE containing 1, 2 or 4 was performed at 1.55 and 1.70V. Bulk electrolysis of TPPMS complexes 3 and 5 in methanol was performed at 1.25 and 1.40V. Varying the oxidation potential has a significant effect on the TON and on the selectivity of the methanol electrooxidation reaction. As expected, the amounts of products formed and the TON are dependent upon the oxidation potential (Table 2). Methyl formate formation is favored by higher potentials, rising from 5 to 33% of the product mixture from catalyst 1 as the potential is increased from 1.55 to 1.70V. The CVs of the heterobimetallic complexes 1–3 all display a slight increase in the catalytic current when small amounts of water are added to the reaction mixtures (Fig. 2). It should be noted that all of the samples contain some water due to the condensation of methanol with formaldehyde to generate DMM (Scheme 1). The effect of additional water on the electrocatalytic reaction was probed by introducing 5μL of water before starting the electrolysis. The presence of water favors the formation of MF (Table 3 ) as previously described for heterogeneous [3] and similar ruthenium [17,18] catalysts. 3.4 Bulk electrolysis of dimethoxymethane The electrooxidation of DMM was studied in order to test the competency of DMM as an intermediate on the pathway to methyl formate. Control experiments have established that the electrooxidation of DMM in DCE does not proceed in the absence of catalyst at a potential of 1.70V. The CV of 1 exhibits no catalytic current in the presence of DMM. Complex 1, however, converts only 4.5 and 6.6% of the DMM to MF when the oxidation potential is 1.55 and 1.70V, respectively. This effectively rules out the direct conversion of DMM to MF as a major pathway for the electrooxidation of methanol to MF. 4 Conclusions The electrochemical oxidation of complexes 1–5 catalyzes the conversion of methanol to DMM and MF. The introduction of water favors the formation of methyl formate. Under the reaction conditions, DMM is converted to MF too slowly to be an intermediate on the main pathway to MF. Although all of the complexes are more selective for DMM formation at lower potentials, this effect is more pronounced for the Ru/Sn complexes 1–3. The electrochemical oxidation of methanol is more efficient and selective for the TPPMS complexes 3 and 5, which allow the oxidation to be performed in methanol as the solvent.
