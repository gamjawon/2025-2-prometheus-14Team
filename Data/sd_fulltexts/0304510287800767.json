NKOSI, NEIL J. COVILLE* Department of Chemistry, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg 2001 (South Africa) MICHEL 0. ALBERS and ERIC SINGLETON National Chemical Research Laboratory, Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, P.O. Box 395, Pretoria 0001 (South Africa) (Received May 6,1986; accepted October 8,1986) Summary [RuH(COD)(PMe2Ph)3] [PFg ] (COD = 1,5-cyclooctadiene), A, a phos- phine-deficient analogue of the alkyne hydrogenation catalyst [RuH- (PMe2Ph)s][PF6], has been observed to hydrogenate both alkynes and alkenes under mild conditions (1 atm P, 25 C). Reactions are hydrogen diffusion controlled. Addition of up to 2 equiv PMe2Ph to reaction solutions containing A results in a change in the catalytic behavior of the solutions such that a decrease in the alkene hydrogenation rate occurs. On addition of 2 equiv PMe2PH, only the hydrogenation of alkynes is observed. Mechanistic features of the catalysed hydrogenation of alkenes and alkynes in the presence of A and related species are discussed. Introduction Mechanistic features of alkene hydrogenation reactions are presently known in considerable detail [I], but far less information is available on the mechanistic course of the alkyne hydrogenation reaction [2]. However, it is known from studies on numerous catalysts that both the alkene and alkyne hydrogenation reactions show many similarities, e.g. as determined by reactant selectivity studies and the formation of cis-hydrogenated products. These catalysts also show preferential activity towards alkyne hydrogenation in alkene/alkyne mixtures, even though the alkene is always hydrogenated at a much more rapid rate than the alkyne when the reactions are carried out separately [3]. A number of catalysts which selectivity hydrogenate alkynes [4] are known. In some instances these catalysts consist of multi- nuclear species in which the alkyne binds to two (or more) metal atoms. This *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/87/$3.60 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 314 binding mode is presumably not feasible for the alkene molecule and hence no alkene hydrogenation is observed. Exclusive alkyne hydrogenation at a mononuclear site has recently been reported for a series of complexes [RuHLs]* (L = phosphine) [5]. These catalysts thus allow for an examination of factors that lead only to alkyne hydrogenation, even when alkene hydrogenation might have been expected. In a preliminary report [5], the reaction of [RuHL.5]'1\" with alkynes was shown to be affected by a variety of factors, including phosphine con- centration. Specifically, high phosphine concentrations favoured both catalyst stability and selectivity. In order to investigate these effects, we have undertaken a study of the catalytic behaviour of a phosphine-deficient analogue of [RuHLs]\"1'. This analogue, derived from [RuI^COD)!^ (COD = 1,5-cyclooctadiene), was found in preliminary studies to be both an alkyne and alkene hs drogenation catalyst. Consequently a more thorough study of this catalyst was prompted, and the results of this investigation are described in this publication. Experimental [RuH(COD)L3] [PF(,] (L = PMe;Ph, PMePhz) as well as [RuHLg] [PFe] (L = PMeaPh) were synthesized by the literature procedures [6, 7]. Alkynes were purchased from various sources and were routinely passed through an alumina column and then degassed by freeze/thaw techniques prior to use. PMe^Ph and PMePhz (Strem Chemicals) were used as purchased. All solvents were dried and degassed prior to use. Reactions were monitored by both hydrogen uptake [8] and/or gas chromatography (GC) techniques (reproduc- ibility of data >5%). GC analysis was performed using a Varian 1400 instrument fitted with a 2 m 10% TCEP on Chromsorb P-AW column. A temperature-controlled program (25 -100 C) was used to maximize peak separations. Internal standards were used to quantify the GC data. Results and discussion Unlike the [RulU^]\"*\" catalysts which preferentially hydrogenate alkynes to alkenes with no alkene hydrogenation [5], a preliminary screening of the [RuI^COD)!^ (L = PMe^Ph, PMePh;) catalysts in tetra- hydrofuran (THF) as solvent indicated that alkenes were hydrogenated to alkanes at a rate comparable to, or greater than, the hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes (Table 1). Since it was also expected (and later observed) that the COD ligand in [RuH(COD)L3]'1' would rapidly be hydrogenated under the reaction conditions, this implied that the catalyst in solution could be viewed as [RuHL^]\"*\" (or [RuH(S)nL3]'1\", S = solvent molecule)*. It is thus *Although alternative structures can be suggested for this complex, e.g. dimer formation etc., these do not affect the conclusion of this study. 315 TABLE 1 Hydrogenation rates of alkenes and alkynes in the presence of [RuH(COD) (PMe-fh)^* Substrate Rate without PMe^Ph1' Rate with PMeaPh\" (ml min~1) (ml min~1) Hzuptake'1 GC HzUptake** GC 1-hexyne 0.2 2.5 - 2-hexyne 2.9 3.0' 1.8 1.6' 3-hexyne 3.8 3.7' 2.1 - PhC=CH 0.1 - 0.2 PhC=CPh 2.2 0.1 - 1-hexene 16.0 15.2 0 0 cyclohexene 2.7 0 cyclooctene 2.8 styrene 0.5 norbornadiene 0.1 1,5-hexadiene 3.3 1,5-COD 9.0 0.9s 1,3-COD 3.6 0.6s \"Reaction conditions: T= 25.0 0.1 C, THF 25 ml, substrate 0.624 mol, catalyst 1.56 X 10~3 mol, stirring rate = 500 rpm. ^n the absence of added PMe^Ph. \"In the presence of 2 molar equiv PMeaPh. dAs determined by H^ uptake.

A survey of a range of solvents (e.g. MeOH, THF, dioxane, CHCIa) for the hydrogenation of cyclohexene suggested that THF would be a suitable solvent for further studies. It is to be noted that solutions of the catalyst are oxygen-sensitive, and if the catalyst solutions are insufficiently deoxygenated the solutions turn green and a concomitant drop in the rate of hydro- genation (usually to zero) takes place. Further, attempts to use the catalyst [RuH^OD)!^]'*' (L = PMePhz) in the cyclohexene hydrogenation reaction gave non-reproducible results under our reaction conditions (footnote a, Table 1), even though the solutions had not turned green. Initially, we sus- pected that this phenomenon resulted from the conversion of the COD ligand via hydride migration to the T^-cycloctenyl ligand, a reaction that has been reported previously [6], and that this allyl species could be catalyt- ically inactive. 316 A B However, hydrogenation of 1-hexene and 1-hexyne was observed in the presence of the pre-formed allyl complex, B, [(T^-CgH^RuL^JPFe (L = PMeaPh) [6] and at present we cannot explain the erratic results obtained with the L = PMePhz catalyst. The hydrogenation of cyclohexene in THF in the presence of [RuH- (COD)(PMe^Ph)y]'1' was chosen for a more comprehensive investigation of these new Ru catalysts, and H; uptake experiments revealed the following. The reaction rate was found to be proportional to catalyst concentration (Fig. 1) and [olefin]/[l + olefin] (Fig. 2). A strong dependence of the reaction rate on the stirring rate was observed (Fig. 3), which implied that the reaction was hydrogen diffusion controlled. A temperature effect similar to that observed previously for the [RuHr^]\"*\" catalyst was observed (Table 2), i.e. the rate increased with temperature, but above 25 C it decreased, suggesting that catalyst deactivation is occurring [5]. Addition of PMeaPh to the catalyst solution resulted in a smooth decrease in the reaction rate from 2.7 ml min~1 (no added PMe^Ph) to 0.0 ml min~1 (2 equiv added PMe^Ph) (Fig. 4).

The data thus indicate that the alkene hydrogenation reaction is completely blocked as the number of coordinated phosphine groups increases. This effect is more dramatically indicated by the reaction of 1- hexene with [RuH(COD)(PMe2Ph)3]'1\", as shown in Fig. 4. 318 TABLE 2 Effect of temperature on the hydrogenation of cyclohexene in the presence of [RuH- (COD^PMeWs]^ T ( C) Rate (ml min\"1) 10.0 20.0 27.0 31.0 40.5 0.7 2.9 3.2 2.1 1.6 \"Reaction conditions: THF 26 ml, substrate to catalyst ratio 400:1, stirring rate 500 rpm, Ha 1 atm.

The reaction of 2-hexyne with [RuEKCODMPMezPl^aF was also investigated in considerable detail. This alkyne was chosen for detailed study, as it is hydrogenated to ci's-2-hexene at a moderate rate and, further, the product cis-2-hexene is only hydrogenated slowly to hexane. The results obtained can be summarised as follows. The reaction rate was found to be independent of catalyst concentration (Table 3), but a strong dependence on stirring rate (Fig. 3) was observed, again suggesting that the reaction was under the control of hydrogen diffusion effects. A remarkable dependence on alkyne concentration (Fig. 5) was also detected, i.e. the reaction rate was more rapid at lower alkyne concentrations, eventually yielding a constant reaction rate as the alkyne concentration increased. This effect may be rationalized in terms of formation of a bis(alkyne)-ruthenium intermediate (see below). 319 TABLE 3 Effect of catalyst concentration on the hydrogenation of 1-hexyne in the presence of [RuIKCODXPMe^)]'1'11 Cat Rate (mol I-1 x 103) (ml min-1) 3.38 3.0 2.24 2.5 1.56 2.5 0.99 2.8 \"Reaction conditions: see footnote Table 2, T = 25.0 0.1 C. 23-0 S a I 2.0 s ^J 1.0 0 500 1000 1500 2000 VOLUME OF 2-HEXYNE (MICROLITRES) Fig. 5. Rate of hydrogen uptake as a function of 2-hexyne concentration. The effect of adding phosphine to the catalyst solution containing 1- hexyne is shown in Fig. 4. An increase in rate from 0.2 ml min~1 to 2.5 ml min\"1 was found as the number of molar equivalents increased from 0 to 2 in the reaction mixture. The reaction rate obtained for the reaction of 1- hexyne with hydrogen in the presence of [RuH(PMe2Ph)s]\"1' was 2.5 ml min-1 [5], identical with that obtained for the [RuH(COD)(PMe2Ph)3:T + 2PMe2Ph system. The results for the effect of phosphine concentration on other alkyne hydrogenation rates are given in Table 1. It is to be noted that terminal alkynes are hydrogenated only slowly by [RuH(COD)L3J1\", but that the reaction rate increases on addition of phosphine; this contrasts with the behaviour of the non-terminal alkynes, where a decrease in reaction rate occurs on phosphine addition to the catalyst solution. A range of other alkenes and dienes were hydrogenated by catalyst A and the results are given in Table 1. It is to be noted that 1,5-COD is rapidly 320 hydrogenated, which is in keeping with the proposal that the catalytically active species in these reactions can be regarded as a solvated '[RuHL^]'1'' species. Competitive rate studies were also performed on various mixtures of substrates using the [RuH(COD)(PMe2Ph)3]'1' catalyst. In particular, the hydrogenation of an equimolar mixture of 1-hexene and 2-hexyne was monitored by gas chromatography. The 2-hexyne was hydrogenated prior to the hydrogenation of 1-hexene, even though the 1-hexene rate in the absence of 2-hexyne is five times faster. This phenomenon has been observed previously [3] and suggests that the metal-alkyne binding constant is greater than the metal-alkene binding constant and that the two reaction sites are the same. Competitive reactions with 1,3-COD and 1,5-COD were also performed. In this instance the rates were similar to the rates observed when the reactions were performed with the individual dienes. Significantly, the 1,5- COD is hydrogenated more rapidly than the 1,3-COD in both instances. In a blank reaction, an equimolar mixture of 1,5-COD and 1,3-COD were added to the catalyst in THF under N2. No isomerization of either 1,5- or 1,3-COD was observed over 24 h. The effects of acid, base and water on the hydrogenation of cyclohexene (standard conditions) were also studied. Additions of 4% water (v/v) to a catalyst solution containing cyclohexene gave a marked change in rate a drop from 2.7 ml min~1 to 0 ml min~1. Thus the use of dry solvent is a requirement for efficient catalysis. Addition of acid (HC1, H2S04; excess) resulted in catalyst deactivation, whereas the addition of base (NEt3; 2 equiv) did not affect the hydrogenation rate. Mechanism of hydrogenation Our data allow us to speculate on the source of the different activities of the ruthenium alkene and alkyne catalysts. Firstly, [RuHL^]'1\" is an 18- electron complex, and for hydrogenation to occur dissociation of one phosphine ligand must take place to yield a [RuHL^]'1' species. Previous studies [5] suggest that the catalyst is thermally unstable but that stability can be improved by addition of L, i.e. to inhibit L dissociation. We propose that it is the [RuHL^]'1\" complex (and not, for instance, solvated [RuHL3]'1\", see below) which reacts with alkynes in preference to alkenes. Studies to establish the binding constants of [RuHL^]'1' with substrates such as L, alkenes and alkynes, and to confirm this proposal, are planned. Secondly, [Rui^COD)!^]^ another 18-electron system, must also formally lose a ligand (or ligands) to function as a catalyst. The hydro- genation rates for the reaction of COD with H2 suggest that ligand loss in this instance is via hydrogenation of the diene. This would suggest that solvated '[RuHLa]\"*\"' is formed rapidly in the reaction. This species could be anticipated to allow for multiple binding of alkynes to the ruthenium atom (two coordination sites are available), rationalizing the following findings: (1) The rate of hydrogenation to ci's alkene products follows the sequence: 1-hexyne < 2-hexyne < 3-hexyne. (It is anticipated that on steric 321 grounds 2 moles of 3-hexyne are less likely to bind to the ruthenium than 2 moles of 1-hexyne.) (2) The unusual effect of a decrease in reaction rate on addition of substrate (Fig. 5) can be explained by an increase in multiple alkyne binding and hence a reduced reaction rate. Also of importance is the ability of the above catalytically active species to hydrogenate olefins. This implies that the active species cannot be the same as that derived from [RuHL;]*. (Attempts were made to identify the catalytically active species in solution during catalysis, but no meaningful conclusions could be drawn from the data.) Combining the above information, we thus suggest that the two catalytic systems (i.e. those derived from [Rum-^]\"*\" and [RuI^COD)!^]'1\") are related as follows [6, 7]: ________________+L[6]______________ I ii, } [RuH(COD)L^ ^ [RuHLar;?^ [RuHL^^ [RuHLsf \"sHM A C D E i.e. C and D are related by loss (or addition) of phosphine (L), and whereas C will hydrogenate both alkenes and alkynes, D only hydrogenates alkynes. It is to be noted that the possiblity of more than one catalytically active species being derived from a single catalyst has been recently proposed for alkyne hydrogenation reactions using [RuHCl(PPh3)3] as a catalyst precursor [9]. Further studies to establish the role of steric and electronic effects of both the substrate and catalyst on the reaction rate will be required before a more detailed proposal of the reaction mechanism can be made.
