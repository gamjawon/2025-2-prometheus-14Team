T. Kiss and Mihaly Bart6k* Department of Organic Chemistry**, Attila Jozsef University, Dom ter 8., H-6720 Szeged (Hungary) (Received October 19, 1991; revised June 10, 1992) Abstract The hydrogenative ring-opening reactions of five alkyl-substituted cyclopropanes [ethyl(ECP), cis-1,2-dimethyl- (cDMCP) and trans- 1,2-dimethyl- (tDMCP), 1,1-dimethyl(1,1DMCP) and 1,1,2,2,-tetramethyl- (TMCP) cyclopropane] over Pt/Si02 catalyst were studied. The shapes of the curves depicting product formation rate vs. HZ pressure suggest that C-C as well as C-H bond rupture occurs upon adsorption. Based on stereochemical considerations and on comparisons of product formation at the maximum rates, it is proposed that cDMCP forms a flat-lying complex over the surface of the catalyst and tDMCP, I ,1 DMCP and TMCP react through edge-on surface intermediates. IR measurements concerning the reaction of ECP support the proposed dissociative adsorption. Introduction The metal-catalyzed transformations of cyclopropanes offer the possibility of studying different, simultaneously occurring reactions (i.e., hydrogenolysis and ring opening) [ 1 ] under relatively mild conditions. On Pt catalysts, however, the only reaction under the usual circumstances (ambient temperature, near atmospheric pressure) is hydrogenative ring opening [2-13]. The characteristic features of this reaction can be, and actually have been, studied through the use of substituted cyclopropanes as models (for reviews, see [ 14 ]). A number of investigations have been performed in order to explore the possible surface intermediates [3, 15-20]. The available information was mostly deduced from kinetic measurements. Direct information about the structures of surface intermediates coming from alkyl-substituted cyclopropanes can be obtained using DZ instead of Hz [21, 22]. The interpretation of these results is not easy, however: secondary exchange processes cannot easily be separated from those occurring upon adsorption. In this work, we report on the hydrogen pressure dependence of the ring-opening rate of suitably chosen alkyl-substituted cyclopropane derivatives. These molecules are substituted in such a way that stereochemical consid- *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. \"Part of the Center for Catalysis, Surface and Material Science. 0304-5102/92/$05.00 1992 - Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

Experimental Malls Five substituted cyclopropanes were prepared and purified through methods given in the literature [23, 24]: ethylcyclopropane (ECP), cis-1,2dimethylcyclopropane (cDMCP), traps-1,2-dimethylcyclopropane (tDMCP), 1,1-dimethylcyclopropane (1,1DMCP) and 1,1,2,2-tetramethylcyclopropane (TMCP). The other reactant, oxygen-free hydrogen, was prepared in a Matheson 8326 generator, operating with a palladium membrane. Catalyst preparation and characterization The Pt/Si02 catalyst was made by impregnating a Cab-O-Sil M5 support (BDH product) with H2PtC16 solution, followed by reduction in flowing hydrogen at 773 K for 16 h. The high-temperature hydrogen treatment diminishes the chlorine content of the catalyst, as revealed by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (the quantity of residual chlorine is negligible - less than 10 ppm relative to the Pt loading). The X-ray fluorescence measurements were performed with an EMG 31800 X-ray analyser. The primary X-ray source was an Ag tube that worked at acceleration voltages of 10, 20 and 30 kV and at 4 mA. For quantitative evaluation, the NBS standard was used. The dispersion of the catalyst (number of exposed Pt atoms/total number of Pt atoms) was determined by H2 chemisorption in a pulse system at room temperature, assuming 1:1 adsorption stoichiometry. The dispersion value obtained (11.8%) was checked by 02-HZ titration at the same temperature and by electron microscopy with a Hitachi H500H transmission electron microscope (particle size is 8.8 nm, which corresponds to a dispersion of 11.590). After the initial reduction, the catalyst was kept in a closed vial in a vacuum desiccator, separate from the place where the reactions were run. Before kinetic measurements, the catalyst samples were activated in the following manner: the reactor (with the catalyst) was evacuated and the catalyst sample was treated with 13.3 kPa of H2 at 318 K for 1 h. Analytical apparatus and procedure The reactions were carried out in a conventional closed-circulation apparatus. The volume of the reactor was 54 cm, and the total volume of the system was 175 cm3. The reactor was heated with an air thermostat. The volume of the sampling capillary was 0.05 cm3, and the total sampling volume was 0.3 cm3. A Carlo Erba Fractovap 2150 gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector was attached to the system. A 4 m long glass 315 column filled with 5% bis(2-methoxyethyl)adipate on Chromosorb PAW 80/ 100 mesh was used for analysis. The reactants (1.33 kPa of the cyclopropane and various amounts of hydrogen) were mixed in the circulation part of the system before the reaction. Prior to mixing, the cyclopropanes were subjected to several freeze-evacuated-thaw cycles. Turnover frey (TOF) data At a given hydrogen pressure, product yield vs. time (t) functions were always determined over a fresh sample of catalyst (usually 5 mg). Initial rates were obtained through differentiation of these functions at t = 0. These rates were converted to TOF (molecule exp. atom-1 s-1) data. on the basis of the number of surface Pd atoms determined by HZ titration. LI? measurements The IR (infrared spectroscopy) measurements were performed using a Specord 71 IR spectrometer attached to a vacuum system with a static IR cell. 24 0.5 mg of the catalyst was pressed into a self-supporting wafer and the IR spectra were taken at room temperature. In these measurements, D2 was used in catalyst pretreatments. Results and discussion The reactions were performed at 318 K in the hydrogen pressure range 0-60 kPa. At this temperature, only hydrogenative ring-opening occurred. Saturated hydrocarbons were formed and there were no cracking products. Two types of ring-opening can take place for each compound. The ring actually opened in both the sterically less-hindered (2,3 C-C bond scission) and more-hindered (1,2 C-C bond scission) directions at every hydrogen pressure. However, the rupture of the sterically less-hindered C-C bond was always the favored ring-opening route. In the absence of hydrogen, no reaction was observed. Figure 1 reveals that under these conditions 1,1 DMCP is the most reactive, while the transformation of TMCP is the slowest. The two stereoisomers are in-between. Comparison of reactivity at the fastest rates for these two latter compounds shows that cDMCP reacts in both the sterically less- and more-hindered directions 2-3 times faster than tDMCP. It can also be seen that the curves of TOF vs. hydrogen pressure all pass through a maximum, which is not very pronounced for 1,1 DMCP but is sharp for the others. In order to provide information about the adsorbed state of the molecules (dissociative or associative adsorption, geometry of adsorbed species) we intend to apply kinetic results and stereochernical considerations together (supplemented with data and conclusions provided by the chemical literature). Let us show how these tools work. 316 TOFl10-1 TO F / 10-1 12 10- 1. 6 2. 0 10 20 30 40 50 pH2/kPa (c) TOF/10-2 15 3 10- 2 5 1 \" M ,I 0 10 20 30 40 50 pH2/kPa 010 20 30 40 50 pH2 /kPa (a) (b) M TOF/10-2 6 5 4 3 2 1 M 0 1020 30 40 50 pH2/1<Pa (d) Fig. 1. Rate of product formation vs. hydrogen pressure over Pt/S'02 at 318 K: (a) cDMCP; (b) tDMCP; (c) 1,1DMCP; (d) TMCP. The shapes of the curves of rate of product accumulation vs. hydrogen pressure provide mechanistic information if the hydrocarbon adsorbs more strongly than hydrogen. Then saturation-type curves point to associatively adsorbed intermediates, while curves containing a maximum suggest dissociatively adsorbed species. Both curves describe a type of noncompetitive adsorption in the sense that excess hydrogen will not flush the adsorbed species off the surface. Product formation is helped by hydrogen up to a certain hydrogen coverage, since there is no reaction and product desorption without it. Nevertheless, increasing hydrogen pressure influences the structure of dissociatively adsorbed species: C-H bond scission - and thus the formation of dissociatively adsorbed species - is suppressed above optimal hydrogen coverage [ 1, 25 ]. As for associatively adsorbed species, their relative abundance and structure are not affected [20]. The application of the above approach can be justified for most of the cyclopropane derivatives used in this study based on the experimental observations of various authors. For cyclopropane and methylcyclopropane over Pt, Anderson and Avery [3], Cerny et al. [26] and, in a recent paper, Brown and Kemball [22] (and for geminally substituted cyclopropanes, Chevreau and Gault [21 ]) showed that adsorption of these hydrocarbons is irreversible, since in no case could D-exchanged cyclopropanes be detected, 317 i.e., ring opening occurred upon adsorption. Only the 1,2 bond scission route of TMCP, which proceeds through a very congested intermediate, represents weaker cyclopropane adsorption i.e., excess hydrogen is able to flush the intermediate off the surface, as shown by the maximum in the TOF vs. hydrogen pressure curve in spite of only associative adsorption being possible. The phenomenon occurring here may be described qualitatively by a simple Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. The stereochemical differences between the cyclopropanes investigated demonstrate that flat adsorption is hindered for 1,1DMCP, TMCP and tDMCP. Comparison of the product formation rates at the maximum values for cDMCP and tDMCP (ratio of 1,2 C-C scissions: 3.3; ratio of 2,3 C-C scissions: 2.5) points to different adsorption geometries. In view of (a) the shapes of the curves of TOF vs. H2 pressure, (b) the geometric features of the cyclopropane derivatives, and (c) the comparison of the rates of product formation for the stereoisomers and the fact that the adsorption of cyclopropane is irreversible [3, 21, 22, 261, i.e., ring opening occurs upon adsorption, the following adsorption states are proposed: (i) each cyclopropane derivative reacts through dissociatively adsorbed surface intermediates (except TMCP in the sterically hindered direction, because of the lack of dissociable hydrogen); (ii) for steric reasons, 1,1DMCP, tDMCP and TMCP react through edgeon surface complexes (the plane of the ring is nearly perpendicular to the surface of the catalyst); (iii) for steric and kinetic reasons, cDMCP adsorbs differently than tDMCP, i.e., it forms a flat-lying surface complex (the plane of the ring lies parallel to the surface of the catalyst). Further support for mainly dissociative adsorption can be obtained from IR measurements (Fig. 2). The H2-treated Pt/Si02 catalyst has a broad OH band in the 3900-3500 cm-1 region (not shown in the figure) due to the silica support. Upon treatment with D2, this OH band disappears (the resulting baseline is curve (A) in the figure) and is transformed into a sharp OD band TRANSMITTANCE/% 3900 3500 V\"/Cm-i Fig. 2.

Upon reaction of a mixture of ECP and DZ in the static system over the D2-treated catalyst, at 318 K = and even more at 333 K - the OH band starts to develop (curve (B) in the figure), demonstrating that hydrogen is appearing in the system; this can originate only from the cyclopropane. Consequently, dissociative adsorption has occurred. The above findings can be sununarized in the following reaction scheme, in which the adsorbed structures used have already been described in the literature (Scheme 1).

The shapes of the curves depicting product formation rate vs. H2 pressure suggest that CC as well as CH bond rupture occurs upon adsorption. Based on stereochemical considerations and on comparisons of product formation at the maximum rates, it is proposed that cDMCP forms a flat-lying complex over the surface of the catalyst and tDMCP, 1,1DMCP and TMCP react through edge-on surface intermediates. IR measurements concerning the reaction of ECP support the proposed dissociative adsorption.",
