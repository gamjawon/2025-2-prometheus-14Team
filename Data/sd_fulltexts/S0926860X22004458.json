Friedel-Crafts (F-C) acylation reaction is one of the most effective processes to produce aromatic ketones. Classical homogeneous Lewis acid catalysts have difficulty in separation and solid waste generation, which limit their industrial application. Herein, binary metal oxide TiO2-SnOx were prepared, these solid solution catalysts show the highly efficient activity for the F-C reaction of veratrole and 4-chlorobenzoyl chloride (4-CBC). The optimized 0.1TiO2-SnOx catalyst exhibits the veratrole conversion of 74 % and the 4-chloro-3′,4′-dimethoxybenzophenone (CDMB) selectivity of 97 %. Additionally, it shows good stability. The outstanding catalytic performance of TiO2-SnOx can be attributed to homogeneous doping of Ti in SnOx at the atomic level, which results in the strong Lewis acid sites with high density on the surface of solid solution. This work revealed the superior Lewis acid catalyst with solid solution structure, constructed through binary metal oxide, can pave a new avenue for developing the solid Lewis acid with excellent catalytic performance. Graphical Abstract The Friedel-Crafts acylation of veratrole with 4-CBC was performed over the χTiO2-SnOx catalyst, which shows a excellent catalytic performance (the conversion of veratrole can reach 74 % and the selectivity of CDMB is up to 97 %). In addition, the catalyst shows the good stability and without observing the obvious deactivation after reused five times. ga1 Keywords Solid solution Binary metal oxides Friedel–Crafts acylation Veratrole 4-Chloro-3′,4′-dimethoxybenzophenone Data Availability No data was used for the research described in the article. 1 Introduction Friedel-Crafts (F-C) acylation reaction, a typical acid-catalyzed reaction, is an effective way to realize the coupling of arene with acid anhydride, acyl chloride or organic acid by forming the C-C bond, which conducts the synthesis of the important chemicals, especially the oxygen-containing chemicals. Generally, the classical Lewis acids (AlCl3 and FeCl3, et al.), and Brønsted acids (HF and H2SO4, et al.) were used as the traditional acid catalysts [1]. Although these catalysts show high catalytic activity under mild conditions, the difficulty of separation and reusing of the catalysts limit their utilization in the industry. Most importantly, the use of metal halides causes problems related to the formation of the strong complex between the metal halide and the ketone product, which leads to the use of more catalyst than stoichiometry. The process usually requires hydrolysis of the complex, resulting in the loss of catalysts and generating great number of corrosive waste streams. On the contrary, solid acid catalysts have been identified as promising alternatives because they are recyclable, environmentally benign, and low-corrosive to equipment. Therefore, it is extremely urgent to develop a kind of efficient solid acid catalyst with outstanding durability and catalytic performance for F-C acylation. Various solid acid catalysts have been developed and applied in F-C acylation, which mainly include zeolites [2–6], heteropoly acids [7,8], ionic liquids [9,10], solid superacid [11–13], Nafion[14] and metal oxides [15–17]. Although solid acid catalysts have the advantages mentioned above, their poor catalytic activity and stability severely restrict the application of these catalysts in F-C acylation reactions. For example, zeolites may be rapidly inactivated due to poisoning of active sites and pore blockage due to the accumulation of bulky intermediates and products[18]. The main disadvantages of HPAs as catalysts are their poor thermal stability and solubility in polar solvents[19]. Solid superacid catalysts have extremely strong acidity, hence they could produce carbon deposition on the surface and deactivate quickly [20]. Recently, some efficient and novel solid acid catalysts have been utilized for F–C acylation reactions. For instance, Chen [19] et al. reported the application of FeTPA/TiO2 in the reaction of benzoyl chloride with m-Xylene, and the yield of 2,4-dimethylbenzophenone could reach 95.1 % under optimal conditions. Ji and co-workers [21] found that ZIF-67 encapsulated phosphotungstic acid catalysts displayed excellent catalytic performance in the F-C reaction of benzoyl chloride with anisole. Ullah [22] et al. reported that Zr-MOF could get high yields in a few minutes for the F-C acylation of benzoyl chloride with aromatic compounds. Zhang [23] et al. used HPW@Zr-BTC to catalyze the F-C reaction of benzoyl chloride and anisole, with 99.4 % conversion and 97.6 % yield. The group of Jia reported that Fe0.8Ni0.2 @NC [24] exhibited better catalytic activity than Fe@NC-800[25] for the acylation of acyl chlorides with aromatic compounds because the introduction of Ni efficiently prevented the agglomeration of Fe-based NPs and produced larger amounts of catalytically active sites. Moreover, some metal oxides have also been used for F-C acylation reactions because they are cheap and reusable. Mona [15] et al. reported that ZnO can catalyze the F-C acylation with acid chlorides at room temperature without solvent. However, it has a poor catalytic performance for the reaction of inert aromatic hydrocarbons and acid chlorides. And then, Hashem [16] et al. reported F–C acylation of chlorobenzene and benzoyl Chloride by α-Fe2O3, but the reaction could be achieved only when acyl chloride as the acylation reagent. Ravasio [17] et al. prepared CuO/SiO2 by the Chemisorption–Hydrolysis technique. The result shows that only finely dispersed CuO be contained in the catalyst can promote the F-C acylation of acetic anhydride with anisole. Guo [26] et al. systematically investigated the acylation process of lipophilic α-Fe2O3 and CaCO3 nanoparticles catalyzing anisole and acetyl chloride in a flow reactor. Under optimal conditions, the yield could be up to 97.8 %. The acylation of veratrole (1,2-dimethoxybenzene), which is suggested as an important building block for the production of alkaloids and pharmaceuticals [27], is an important reaction, due to the commercial importance of the products, especially in perfumery and medicine industry. For example, acetylation of veratrole could synthesize acetoveratrole, a precursor to the ingredients in an insecticide formulation (verbutin) [28] and an opium-alkaloid antispasmodic (papaverine) [29]. Moreover, the 3,4-dimethoxybenzophenone produced by benzoylation of veratrole can be further hydrogenated for getting secondary alcohol which is of commercially value [30]. Herein, a series of binary metal oxide χTiO2-SnOx (χ denoted as the molar ratio of Ti/(Ti+Sn)) were prepared to evaluate the F-C acylation reaction of 4-chlorobenzoyl chloride (4-CBC) and veratrole ( Fig. 1). As a result, 0.1TiO2-SnOx mixed oxide catalyst with solid solution structure shows a high 4-chloro-3′,4′-dimethoxybenzophenone (CDMB) selectivity of 97 % and veratrole conversion of 74 % under mild conditions. Furthermore, this catalyst can be recycled at least five times without observing the obvious deactivation, indicating its good stability. The results of temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) and infrared spectroscopic analysis of pyridine (Py-IR) suggest that the excellent activity can be attributed to abundant strong Lewis acid sites. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials The binary metal oxides were synthesized by co-precipitation. The hydroxides of Sn and Ti were precipitated by dissolving SnCl2·2H2O (Macklin, 99 %) and tetrabutyl titanate (TBT, Macklin, 99 %) in ethanol (150 mL), (NH4)2CO3 (Macklin, 99 %) is then added dropwise in deionized water (100 mL). The total amount of SnCl2·2H2O and TBT was 0.06 mol, and (NH4)2CO3 was 0.144 mol. The above mixture was stirred at 800 rpm for 2 h to form a slurry and aged for 6 h at 50 °C, followed by washing with deionized water (2.5 L) before the precipitate was collected by filtration. The obtained solids were dried overnight at 100 °C and then calcined in air at 550 °C for 3 h. The resulting samples were named χTiO2-SnOx, where χ represents the molar ratio of Ti to all metals. 2.2 Catalyst characterization The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku D/Max-2400 powder diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation at a scanning rate of 4°/min. The pore volumes and surface areas of the samples were measured by nitrogen adsorption on a Micromeritics ASAP 2460 gas adsorption analyzer at − 196 °C. The samples were pretreated at 300 °C for 6 h. The specific surface area was determined by the Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET) method, meanwhile the pore size distributions were calculated via the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) equation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were acquired using an FEI Talos F200s high-resolution TEM. The samples were dispersed in 1 mL ethanol and sonicated for 10 min before the solution was added to a copper grid. The samples were dried and placed into the vacuum chamber of the TEM to measure. In addition, high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) images were observed on an FEI Talos electron microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded using a Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD photoelectron spectrometer equipped with an Al600 W monochromator and Al/Mg dual anode with a spatial resolution of 3 µm. The maximum value of the C peak in the C 1 s spectrum was 284.8 eV, which is used as the reference for binding energy. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of ammonia was performed on a Micrometrics Autochem Ⅱ chemisorption analyzer. About 0.1 g of the sample was placed in a U-shaped quartz cell above an appropriate amount of quartz wool. The sample was heated at 300 °C for 60 min under argon flow. Subsequently, the temperature was cooled to 50 °C. For NH3 adsorption, the treated metal oxide samples were saturated by adsorbing 10 % NH3/He mixture at 50 °C. Afterward, the sample was flushed in a stream of ultra-high-purity grade He at 50 °C to remove physisorbed NH3 on the oxides. The NH3-TPD profile of the sample was recorded by elevating the temperature from 50 °C to 800 °C at a ramp rate of 10 °C/min under 30 mL/min of He flow. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine experiments was performed on a Thermo Nicolet 380 FTIR spectrometer for in situ Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) measurements. Briefly, the fine sample was loaded into the reaction cell. The sample was heated to 200 °C and evacuated to 10−3 Pa for 1 h to cleanly remove gas molecules from the sample surface, then cooled to ambient temperature and the background spectrum was collected. The pyridine vapor was then introduced into the in-situ tank. After equilibrating for 30 min, it was heated to 150 °C and 300 °C, respectively, and vacuumized again to 10−3 Pa for at least 30 min, and then cooled to ambient temperature. The treated samples were scanned in the wave-number range of 400–4000 cm−1, and their IR spectra were acquired at each target temperature. Thermogravimetric (TG) experiment was performed on an HCT-2 thermal analyzer to observe the carbon deposition amount of the sample. Approximately 10 mg of the used sample was heated from 25 °C to 800 °C under an air flow of 50 mL/min, and the mass change of the sample was recorded. X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) was utilized to determine the chemical compositions of TiO2-SnOx catalysts on the PANalytical Magix PW2403 sequential spectrophotometer using a rhodium tube as the source radiation. And the XRF measurements were performed onto pressed powder. 2.3 Catalyst evaluation For F-C acylation of veratrole, a glass pressure tube (reactor) contains 200 mg χTiO2-SnOx, 3.3 mmol veratrole, and 4-chlorobenzoyl chloride with the calculated amount. The glass tube was sealed to form a closed system after mixing well. Then the reaction mixture was stirred at a desired temperature and time. After the reaction, the reactors were cooled and the internal standard (anisole) was added to the solutions, the concentration of each component of the mixture was then analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Agilent 1260-Infinity) using a Poroshell 120 EC-C18 column, detected at a wavelength of 280 nm with a VWD detector. The mobile phase was a mixture of acetonitrile and water at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The initial acetonitrile/water ratio was 90/10 (v/v), followed by reducing to 20/80 (v/v) within 5 min, then changed to 10/90 (v/v) within 3 min and maintained for 2 min. Finally, the ratio was increased to 90/10 (v/v) within 1 min and maintained for 2 min The productions were analyzed using relative peak areas (as shown in Eq. 1 and Eq. 2) versus the internal standard. (1) Conversion ( % ) = M v 0 − M v M v 0 × 100 % (2) Selectivity ( % ) = S c ∑ S i × 100 % Where Mv0 is the initial molar amount of the veratrole; Mv is the remaining molar amount of veratrole; Sc is the peak area of the target product (CDMB); ∑Si is the sum of the peak areas of all products (The main by-product is obtained by further acylation of CDMB). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalytic performance Figure 1a shows the catalytic performance of χTiO2-SnOx binary oxides for the acylation of veratrole with 4-CBC. With increasing the Ti/(Sn+Ti) molar ratio from 0 to 0.1, the conversion of veratrole increases slightly and the selectivity of CDMB enhances. The 0.1TiO2-SnOx binary oxide exhibits the highest conversion of veratrole and the selectivity of CDMB can reach 97 %, which shows the optimal activity. With continually increasing the doping content of Ti in SnOx, the conversion of veratrole decreases sharply while the selectivity of CDMB does not change significantly. The effect of the molar ratio of 4-CBC/veratrole on the catalytic performance was also investigated over the optimal 0.1TiO2-SnOx catalyst. As shown in Fig. 1b, the highest conversion of veratrole can be achieved when the 4-CBC/veratrole molar ratio is 0.9, and then the conversion decreases by gradually increasing the molar ratio of 4-CBC/veratrole. In addition, the conversion of veratrole is closely related to the reaction temperature (Fig. 1c). When the reaction temperature was elevated from 80 °C to 160 °C, the conversion of veratrole significantly increases from 27 % to 81 %, while the selectivity of CDMB shows an apparent decrease. After comprehensive analysis of conversion and selectivity, 120 °C is considered the optimal temperature. The conversion of veratrole was dependent on reaction time (Fig. 1d), the highest veratrole conversion and a good CDMB selectivity can be obtained with the reaction time of 6 h, further prolonging reaction temperature leads to a decrease in CDMB selectivity. Finally, a CDMB selectivity as high as 97 % and a veratrole conversion of 74 % were obtained under the optimal reaction conditions. 3.2 Structural characterization In order to understand the effect of TiO2 doping in SnOx on the catalytic performance of the acylation of veratrole with 4-CBC, a series of χTiO2-SnOx binary oxides were characterized. Fig. 2a shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles of the χTiO2-SnOx. TiO2 exhibits the typical anatase structure (JCPDF#21–1272), and the SnOx prepared through the coprecipitation method mainly forms the tetragonal SnO2 (JCPDF#41–1445), while simultaneously mixed with some tetragonal structured SnO (JCPDF#06–0395). The doping of Ti (0 to 30 %) into SnOx leads to the diffraction peak gradually shifting to a higher angle, (marked by the red line in Fig. 2a), the TiO2 species are not detected with increasing the Ti content from 0 % to 30 %, suggesting the formation of solid solution structure through the replacement of Sn with Ti. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image shows the interplanar spacing of 0.1TiO2-SnOx is about 0.34 nm (Fig. 2b and Fig. 5b), which belongs to the tetragonal SnO2 (110). According to aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images and element distribution (Fig. 2c), Ti species are homogeneously dispersed in SnOx. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of the χTiO2-SnOx exhibit that the binding energy of Sn (Fig. 2d) in χTiO2-SnOx changes within 0.3 eV, whereas the binding energy of Ti in χTiO2-SnOx is evidently reduced in comparison with TiO2 (Fig. 2e). This indicates that the electronic property of the Ti site can be affected by the neighboring Sn site. Fig. 2f and Fig. S2 show peak fitting for O 1 s XPS peaks of each sample. 530.6, 531.9, and 533.0 eV binding energies can be attributed to lattice oxygen, oxygen vacancy, and adsorbed water [31], respectively. The results of N2 adsorption-desorption analysis exhibit that large hysteresis rings appeared in all samples at relative pressures ranging from 0.5 to 1 (Fig. S1), which was caused by the formation of interparticle mesoporous due to the particle aggregation. In addition, with the increase of Ti content, the pore size of the catalyst decreases from 257 to 97 Å, while the specific surface area significantly increases from 15.6 to 108.5 m2/g (Table S1). 3.3 Acid properties In order to understand the intrinsic acid functionalities of the χTiO2-SnOx and relate them to their catalytic behavior, NH3-TPD and Py-IR were conducted. The NH3-TPD of SnOx (Fig. 3a) shows two desorption peaks cantered at 100 °C and 400 °C, which can be attributed to weak acid and medium strong acid sites, respectively. The changing of acid intensity for χTiO2-SnOx is attributed to the doping of TiO2, in which the doping of TiO2 can significantly increase the content of weak acid sites. In contrast, the TiO2 only shows the weak acid sites that are centered at 100 °C. It indicates that the doping of TiO2 into SnOx forms the interaction between TiO2 and SnOx, which affect the acid properties of χTiO2-SnOx. The NH3-TPD results were processed by the fitting method in Fig. S3, and the amount of acid sites (Table S2) can be obtained by calculating these data. Fig. 3b shows a comparison of the strong acid sites of different catalysts and their corresponding catalytic performance, which indicates that the amount of strong acid sites is critical to the activity of the reaction. Fig. 3c shows the diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra (DRIFTS) of SnOx, 0.1TiO2-SnOx, and the 0.3TiO2-SnOx mixed oxides with the adsorption of pyridine. The peaks centered at 1445, 1574, and 1608 cm−1 are assigned to the adsorption of pyridine on Lewis acid sites, and the peaks centered at 1544 and 1641 cm−1 can be attributed to protonated pyridine species on Brønsted acid sites, in addition, the peak centered at 1490 cm−1 can be ascribed to the adsorption of pyridine on Lewis and Brønsted acid sites [32]. It is worth mentioning that the Lewis acid sites are dominated on these catalysts. The intensity of these peaks involving Brønsted and Lewis acid decreases with elevating temperature, suggesting the desorption of weakly adsorbed pyridine, which is consistent with the NH3-TPD results. In addition, the proportion of Brønsted acid sites and Lewis acid sites (B/L)[33] in the samples is basically unchanged (Table S3). Based on these results, it is speculated that 0.1TiO2-SnOx with high intensity of strong Lewis acid sites results in its high catalytic activity for F-C acylation reaction. 3.4 Stability The stability of the catalyst was also investigated, the used catalyst shows the deactivation for this reaction by washing with ethyl acetate (Fig. S4). Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis (Fig. S5) of catalysts shows that, compared with fresh catalyst, the used catalyst has obvious weight loss, indicating the formation of trace coke on the surface of the catalyst. Therefore, the used catalyst with calcining at 385 °C can keep a good catalytic performance, and the catalyst reuses four times with the activity decreased slightly (Fig. 4). The XRD patterns and TEM images (Fig. 5) of the used catalyst (used five times) show no obvious change in the structure. Compared with the fresh catalyst, the content of SnO2 and TiO2 in the used 0.1TiO2-SnOx show the slightly change, indicating the stability of 0.1TiO2-SnOx catalyst. However, the acid strength of the used 0.1TiO2-SnOx catalyst decreases slightly (Fig. S6). Therefore, the catalytic activity of 0.1TiO2-SnOx catalyst decreases somewhat with increasing recycling numbers. The plausible reaction mechanism for the F-C acylation of veratrole and 4-CBC with TiO2-SnOx catalyst is presented in Scheme 1. The 4-CBC first attacks the strong Lewis acid sites of the TiO2-SnOx catalyst to form the corresponding carbocation intermediate, followed by an electrophilic attack on the veratrole. The final product, CDMB, is formed by substituting a proton in the benzene ring of veratrole with a 4-chlorobenzoyl group. To demonstrate the general applicability of 0.1TiO2-SnOx in F-C acylation reactions, the acylation of veratrole with acetyl chloride or acetic anhydride was also investigated. Veratrole can be effectively converted to the corresponding aromatic ketones over the 0.1TiO2-SnOx catalyst with high selectivity (Table S5). However, it can be seen that the 0.1TiO2-SnOx has poor activity when acetic anhydride as acylation reagent, hence the catalytic performances of TiO2-SnOx catalysts need to be further improved to expand their application. 4 Conclusions In summary, a series of χTiO2-SnOx solid solution catalysts were successfully prepared through doping TiO2 into SnOx. The optimal catalyst 0.1TiO2-SnOx shows the high catalytic performance for Friedel–Crafts acylation of veratrole with 4-CBC, in which the conversion of veratrole can reach 74 % and the selectivity of CDMB is up to 97 %. The optimal activity can be attributed to the amounts of strong Lewis acid sites. In addition, the catalyst shows good stability by only calcining at 385 °C, indicating the high structural stability of solid solution. This work opens a new avenue for the designing of the solid acid catalyst with constructing solid solution through multi-components.

        "dc:description": "Friedel-Crafts (F-C) acylation reaction is one of the most effective processes to produce aromatic ketones. Classical homogeneous Lewis acid catalysts have difficulty in separation and solid waste generation, which limit their industrial application. Herein, binary metal oxide TiO2-SnOx were prepared, these solid solution catalysts show the highly efficient activity for the F-C reaction of veratrole and 4-chlorobenzoyl chloride (4-CBC). The optimized 0.1TiO2-SnOx catalyst exhibits the veratrole conversion of 74 % and the 4-chloro-3′,4′-dimethoxybenzophenone (CDMB) selectivity of 97 %. Additionally, it shows good stability. The outstanding catalytic performance of TiO2-SnOx can be attributed to homogeneous doping of Ti in SnOx at the atomic level, which results in the strong Lewis acid sites with high density on the surface of solid solution. This work revealed the superior Lewis acid catalyst with solid solution structure, constructed through binary metal oxide, can pave a new avenue for developing the solid Lewis acid with excellent catalytic performance.",
