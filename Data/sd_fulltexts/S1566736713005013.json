Metal oxides are commonly used as the supports of gold nanoparticles for catalytic CO oxidation, whereas metal salts are rarely considered suitable supports. In the present work, we developed a new kind of gold nanocatalyst supported on heterostructured PbSO4-MCF mesoporous materials that was prepared by an in situ growth method using dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) as a sulfonate precursor. It was found that an Au/PbSO4-MCF (SDBS) catalyst preheated at 300°C showed high CO conversion below 100°C. In addition, the stability of selected catalysts was studied as a function of time on stream. Because of the alteration of surface properties, these Au nanocatalysts were highly sinter-resistant. Graphical abstract Keywords PbSO4-MCF Gold nanocatalyst CO oxidation Catalyst supports Mesoporous materials 1 Introduction The use of supported gold nanoparticles as efficient catalysts for CO oxidation has attracted broad interest since the pioneering research of Haruta and coworkers [1,2]. Besides the size of gold nanoparticles, supports play an important role in determining the catalyst activity and stability [3–5]. Most of gold catalysts are loaded on metal oxide supports. The reducibility of the supports is often considered a key factor in determining the activity of gold catalysts for CO oxidation [6,7] because of their ability to activate oxygen through oxygen-vacancy defects and charge transfer from the surfaces of metal oxides to gold nanoparticles [8,9]. Despite the importance of the reducibility of the support, several researchers have used metal salts as supports for preparing gold catalysts [10,11]. Notably, Lian et al. [12] found that Au/BaCO3 was active for CO oxidation at room temperature but deactivated quickly on stream. Our group recently communicated that gold nanoparticles supported on nonreducible nanosized LaPO4 [13] or other metal phosphates [14] were active for CO oxidation at low temperature. Theoretical calculations by Liu et al. [15] indicated that heterostructured supports could induce heterogeneity in metal–support interaction energies, which might stabilize metal nanoparticles. Our previous work reported the preparation of lanthanide phosphate–SiO2 mesoporous cellular foam (MCF) materials. They were used as supports for gold nanoparticles, and the as-prepared catalysts exhibited high activity in CO oxidation [16]. Furthermore, we reported the synthesis of gold nanocatalysts supported on heterostructured BaSO4-MCF hybrid materials with BaSO4 nanocrystals coated on the MCF surface, which also showed high catalytic activity and stability for CO oxidation [17]. These findings prompted us to investigate whether there are other inorganic salt-based supports that are nonreducible but “active” supports for gold catalysts. PbSO4, a nonreducible metal sulfate, is normally used as a material in battery cells and painting [18]. However, there has been little effort to develop the catalytic application of PbSO4. Herein, we report the synthesis of heterostructured PbSO4-MCF hybrid materials, with nanosized PbSO4 coated on the MCF surface, which were used as supports for loading gold via a deposition–precipitation (DP) method (Scheme 1 ). The catalytic performance of Au/PbSO4-MCF in CO oxidation was studied, and structural characterization of the catalysts was carried out by employing X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen physisorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It is interesting that gold nanoparticles can be well dispersed on a PbSO4-MCF support and show significant activity for CO oxidation. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of gold catalysts All chemicals used were obtained from Aldrich and used as received without further purification. The MCF was synthesized as described by Schmidt-Winkel et al. [19,20]. The PbSO4-MCF materials (Pb%=10% (wt.%)) were prepared by an in situ growth method similar to that developed recently for the synthesis of BaSO4-MCF hybrid materials [17], using either sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) or KHSO4 as a sulfonate precursor. The gold precursor was introduced onto the PbSO4-MCF support using DP as described in the literature [13]. The as-synthesized catalysts were Au/PbSO4-MCF (SDBS) and Au/PbSO4-MCF (KHSO4). 2.2 Characterization The XRD data were recorded with a PANalytical Empyrean diffractometer operated at 45kV and 40mA. The nitrogen physisorption isotherms were measured at 77K using a Gemini 2375 surface area analyzer. TEM and Z-contrast scanning TEM were conducted using HITACHI HD2000 microscopes with an accelerating voltage of 200kV. Elemental analysis was done by inductively couple plasma (ICP) using an Optima 2100 DV spectrometer (PerkinElmer Corporation). XPS data were collected using a PHI 3056 spectrometer with an Al anode source operated at 15kV and an applied power of 350W. Adventitious carbon and Si4+ from the SiO2 were used to calibrate the binding energy shifts of the sample (C1s 3 284.8eV, Si4+ 103.7eV). 2.3 Catalytic CO oxidation Before the catalytic test, each catalyst was activated by calcination under air at 300 or 500°C for 2h. Catalytic CO oxidation and analysis of CO and CO2 were carried out as described in the literature [16] with a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 30,000mL (h∙gcat)−1. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of supports and catalysts From the XRD pattern of PbSO4-MCF (SDBS) (Fig. 1a), almost no PbSO4 peaks were observed and only a broad peak corresponding to the MCF was detected, indicating that PbSO4 was highly dispersed on the MCF. However, in the XRD pattern of PbSO4-MCF (KHSO4) (Fig. 1a), there were some obvious diffraction peaks corresponding to those of crystalline PbSO4; and the average particle size (15nm) estimated from the XRD peaks was much larger than that in the PbSO4-MCF (SDBS). According to the XRD patterns in Fig. 1b, for the Au/PbSO4-MCF (SDBS) catalyst pretreated at 300°C, the metallic gold peaks (38, 44, 65, and 78°) were either quite broad or not appreciable. This result suggested that gold nanoparticles were well dispersed on the PbSO4-MCF (SDBS) support, and gold nanoparticles (2–4nm) were smaller than those of the Au/PbSO4-MCF (KHSO4) catalyst despite the fact that the gold loading of both catalysts was about 1.2–1.3wt.% determined by ICP analysis. The mesoporosity was further confirmed by N2 adsorption measurements (Fig. 2 ). The shape of the hysteresis loop of the adsorption isotherms suggested that the large mesopores of the samples had an “ink-bottle” shape [19,21]. After being coated with PbSO4 nanoparticles, the PbSO4-MCF (SDBS) support still exhibited a high BET surface area of 430.3m2/g and a narrow pore size distribution centering at 29nm, which was a little smaller than that of the MCF (31nm). The results indicated that the PbSO4 nanoparticles were well dispersed on the surfaces inside the MCF pores, and the in situ growth synthesis is an effective method to obtain heterostructured PbSO4-MCF mesoporous materials. TEM images of PbSO4-MCF and Au/PbSO4-MCF samples are shown in Fig. 3 . Obviously, the size of PbSO4 in PbSO4-MCF (KHSO4) was larger than that in PbSO4-MCF (SDBS), which was consistent with the XRD results. The larger particles indicated a burst reaction and nucleation between the Pb2+ species and inorganic SO4 2− which resulted in the aggregation of PbSO4 nanocrystals on the surface of MCF, which is the reason why the organic sulfonate precursor (SDBS) was adopted in this work. As has been reported [17], alkane sulfonate can react with Pb2+ species dispersed on the surface of MCF to form lead sulfonate micelles through a strong electrostatic interaction, which can slow down the nucleation rate and thus benefit the generation of a coating of nanocrystals of a smaller size on MCF. Fig. 3c and d provided further visual evidence that gold nanoparticles were highly dispersed on heterostructured PbSO4-MCF supports. In Fig. 3c, quite small, uniform gold nanoparticles (2–4nm) were distributed on a PbSO4-MCF (SDBS) support for the Au/PbSO4-MCF (SDBS) catalyst after calcination at 300°C, which was consistent with its broadened XRD peak of metallic gold. However, for the Au/PbSO4-MCF (KHSO4) catalyst pretreated at 300°C, besides the tiny gold nanoparticles, some bigger gold nanoparticles (>10nm) can also be observed on the supports (Fig. 3d). The large particle size of the PbSO4 in Au/PbSO4-MCF (KHSO4) reduced the surface area of the PbSO4 available to contact with gold, which could cause more gold particles to deposit on the SiO2 surface and thus make it easy to sinter when treated at an elevated temperature [22]. XPS was used to study the influence of PbSO4 on the chemical state of Au over the 300°C-pretreated Au/PbSO4-MCF (SDBS) catalyst, and the result was shown in Fig. S1. From Fig. S1, a single Au peak was observed at 83.85eV in the Au 4f spectra, which was consistent with the formation of the metallic Au0 species (84.0eV) [23].

From Fig. S1, a single Au peak was observed at 83.85eV in the Au 4f spectra, which was consistent with the formation of the metallic Au0 species (84.0eV) [23]. 3.2 Catalytic performance The catalytic properties of Au/PbSO4-MCF (SDBS) and Au/PbSO4-MCF (KHSO4) pretreated at 300°C were probed by CO oxidation under a transient state at a GHSV of 30,000mL (h·gcat)−1, as shown in Fig. 4a. Without the introduction of gold nanoparticles, PbSO4-MCF showed no activity. After pretreatment at 300°C, Au/PbSO4-MCF (SDBS) exhibited excellent activity (complete CO conversion at 100°C), whereas Au/PbSO4-MCF (KHSO4) was much less active (complete CO conversion at about 270°C). High-temperature treatment is a very stringent test for the stability of gold nanocatalysts against sintering. Therefore, the stability of 300°C-pretreated Au/PbSO4-MCF (SDBS) and 300°C-pretreated Au/PbSO4-MCF (KHSO4) as a function of time on stream was tested for CO oxidation at a GHSV of 30,000mL (h·gcat)−1, under 50°C (Fig. 4b). In order to elucidate the effect of support on the conversion of CO, we have calculated the turnover frequency (TOF) over both catalysts on the basis of the data listed in Table S1. Under 50°C, the TOF of CO over the Au/PbSO4-MCF (SDBS) catalyst was 9.75s−1, which was higher than the TOF of CO over the Au/PbSO4-MCF (KHSO4) catalyst (3.72s−1). In addition, the stability of the 500°C-pretreated Au/PbSO4-MCF (SDBS) catalyst was tested for CO oxidation at a GHSV of 30,000mL (h·gcat)−1, under 150°C. As can be seen from Fig. 4b, although the catalytic activity of Au/PbSO4-MCF (SDBS) (500°C pretreatment) was much lower than that of Au/PbSO4-MCF (SDBS) (300°C pretreatment), the conversion of CO over both of the catalysts still seemed to be stable over 15h on stream. High-temperature treatment is a very stringent test for the stability of gold nanocatalysts against sintering. Therefore, the stability of 300°C-pretreated Au/PbSO4-MCF (SDBS) and 300°C-pretreated Au/PbSO4-MCF (KHSO4) as a function of time on stream was tested for CO oxidation at a GHSV of 30,000mL (h·gcat)−1, under 50°C (Fig. 4b). In order to elucidate the effect of support on the conversion of CO, we have calculated the turnover frequency (TOF) over both catalysts on the basis of the data listed in Table S1.

In order to further investigate the metal sintering of the two catalysts, TEM analysis of the spent Au/PbSO4-MCF (SDBS) and Au/PbSO4-MCF (KHSO4) catalysts after CO oxidation under a transient state (Fig. 4a) was performed. As shown in Fig. S2, there were a little metal sintering on the two catalysts. From Fig. S2(a), over the spent Au/PbSO4-MCF (SDBS) catalyst, most of the Au particles were between 5 and 7nm with only a few bigger than 8nm. On the contrary, it could be observed that most of the Au particles over the spent Au/PbSO4-MCF (KHSO4) catalyst were 8–10nm, suggesting that the more serious gold sintering occurred during the reaction.

Based on the literature [6,7], an oxide-supported catalyst requires the reduction of the oxides to invoke the strong metal–support interaction (SMSI). This support effect is largely related to the surface defects (i.e., oxygen vacancies) abundant on the reducible oxides, which play a crucial role in controlling the nucleation and growth of nanosized gold particles and consequently the generation of low-coordination gold sites responsible for the activation of molecular oxygen. However, the negligible reducibility of PbSO4 implies that Au/PbSO4-MCF may rely on other means to enhance SMSI. As reported in the literature [13], one possible activation mechanism during the calcination of Au/PbSO4-MCF could involve the surface restructuring of the gold–support interfaces. Obviously, the smaller particle size of PbSO4 in PbSO4-MCF (SDBS) may play a key role in this surface-restructuring process by providing a high-surface-defect concentration compared with the PbSO4-MCF (KHSO4) support. The unique restructuring properties of nanoparticles with ionic lattices have recently been revealed in the generation of new nanoparticle phases [24,25]. So there are two possible reasons for the observed difference induced by the support effect. First, the PbSO4 nanoparticles in PbSO4-MCF supports may either provide active sites such as oxygen species or interact strongly with metals. In addition, these PbSO4 nanoparticles grow on silica surfaces, forming unique interpenetrated heterostructures that induce the heterogeneity of gold–support interaction energies on support surfaces and provide the extra activation energy for sintering of gold nanoparticles. Further infrared spectroscopic research is in progress to shed light on the support effects and reaction mechanism. 4 Conclusions Heterostructured PbSO4-MCF mesoporous materials prepared by a general in situ growth method have been developed as new nonreducible but “active” gold catalyst supports for CO oxidation. The high activity and stability of gold nanoparticles deposited on a PbSO4-MCF (SDBS) support suggest a unique interaction between gold nanoparticles and nanosized PbSO4 supports that highlight new opportunities in the development of nanosized metal salt supports for stable gold catalysts.

In the present work, we developed a new kind of gold nanocatalyst supported on heterostructured PbSO4-MCF mesoporous materials that was prepared by an in situ growth method using dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) as a sulfonate precursor. It was found that an Au/PbSO4-MCF (SDBS) catalyst preheated at 300°C showed high CO conversion below 100°C. In addition, the stability of selected catalysts was studied as a function of time on stream. Because of the alteration of surface properties, these Au nanocatalysts were highly sinter-resistant.",
