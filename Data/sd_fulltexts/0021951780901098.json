Their hydrodesulfurization activities (for diben- zothiophene) had previously been determined. Surface areas of the activity-tested catalysts gave little or no correlation with catalytic activity. However, a clear, linear relationship emerged when activities were plotted against Oa chemisorption capacities of the activity-tested catalysts. These results are discussed in terms of the anisotropic nature of molybdenum disulfide. The structural nature of the layered tran- sition metal dichalcogenides is intimately related to their practical uses. Thus, the lubricity of MoSa stems from the weak bonding between adjacent basal planes. The intercalative properties of TiSz, which has been exploited in nonaqueous battery applications (/), are likewise the conse- quence of the weak interlayer forces. Another important application of transi- tion metal dichalcogenides occurs in the area of heterogeneous catalysis. MoSz and, to a lesser extent WSz are the active com- ponents in catalysts currently in large-scale use for the removal of sulfur and nitrogen from a variety of petroleum feedstocks. In this report, we consider the question of whether the basal plane or edge plane is the source of this activity. A previous report from this laboratory has described the low-temperature precipi- tation of amorphous MoSa (2). Another re- cent communication has dealt with the highly disordered rag-like morphology that develops when this material is annealed in HzS/Hg at 400 (3). The high sur- face/volume ratio of this substance is suit- able for catalytic studies, as well as ancil- lary techniques such as chemisorption. In the present investigation we have at- * Presented at AlChE National Meeting, San Fran- cisco, November 1979. tempted to exploit this by the combined study of selective chemisorption (using a plane-specific adsorbate) and catalytic ac- tivity. The literature does not indicate a suitable chemisorption agent. However, an account by Bahl et al. (4) is suggestive. They inves- tigated single crystals of MoSa at 500- 600 and found that the edge plane oxi- dized much more rapidly than did the basal plane. This points to the possible use of Oa as a plane-specific adsorbate for MoSa, but a problem is posed by its strength of reac- tion with catalysts of this type. Well-dis- persed, sulfided, molybdena-containing catalysts react vigorously with oxygen, even at ambient temperature, and such uncontrolled, exothermic adsorption will lead to a process that is no longer surface selective. In order to obtain valid edge-plane area measurements, we have employed Oz chemisorption in a dynamic mode; pulses of Oa are added to a carrier gas stream and thus rapidly traverse the catalyst bed. The brief and intermittent adsorbate-catalyst contact leads to results which indicate that subsurface oxidation has been effectively suppressed. Using Oz chemisorption in this manner, we have characterized a number of MoSa catalyst samples after these had been tested for the hydrodesulfurization of diben- zothiophene.

This enabled a comparison of the relative correlatabilities of Oy, chemi- sorption and total surface area with cata- lytic activity. EXPERIMENTAL Preparation of Catalysts Catalysts were prepared by one of three basic routes, designated A, B, or C in Table 1. (A) Metathetical reaction ofMoCLi with a stoichiometric amount ofLiSa. After solvent washing (ethyl acetate) to remove Lid, the dried precipitate was treated in 15% HzS/Ha at a temperature indicated in Table l. (B) Mods was dissolved in metha- noi to give MoOds and this solution was added to a solution containing excess (N4)28. After solvent washing (MeOH or HzO) the dried precipitate was treated in 15% HzS/Hz at 400 or 800 as indicated in Table 1. (C) Decomposition of ammonium thiomolybdate, yielding MoS3 and (N114)28.

Variations of these three basic preparative routes will be pointed out either in the discussion of Table 1 or in its footnotes. Hydrodesulfurization Runs Catalytic activity was studied in a stirred autoclave modified so as to permit hydro- gen flow and liquid sampling. The autoclave was fitted with a condenser so that despite hydrogen flow, all organic materials were retained and the reactor was static in this sense. The reaction studied was the hy- drodesulfurization of dibenzothiophene (DBT), at 350 and 450 psi pressure. The catalyst (l g, 20/40-mesh pressed powder, diluted with A-in. porcelain beads) was placed in a 10-cm3 basket. In several cases it was pretreated m situ with flowing HzS/Hz as indicated in Table 1. With the reactor at ambient temperature, a flow of Ha at 100 cmVmin was established and the reactor charged with 5 wt% DBT/decalin. The pressure was adjusted to 450 psi and the temperature raised to 350. Liquid sampling commenced when 350 was reached and was repeated at hourly inter- vals. Samples were analyzed with a Perkin- Elmer 900 gas Chromatograph, using a flame ionization detector and a 10% SP 2100 column. In order to obtain rate con- stants, the concentrations of the two prod- ucts (biphenyl and cyclohexylbenzene) which result from the hydrodesulfurization of DBT were summed and plotted against time. Conversions of DBT <30% were used. In this regime, essentially linear con- centration vs time plots will be obtained even if first-order dependence on DBT con- centration prevails. Thus, even in the absence of knowledge of the true reaction order under our conditions, the slopes of the linear concentration vs time plots which we obtained sufficed to provide relative rate constants for these catalysts. Characterization of Activity-Tested Catalysts The activity-tested catalysts were recov- NOTES 517 ered and their surface areas were deter- mined by the BET method using N3 at 195. In addition, their capacities for 02 chemisorption were determined in a flow apparatus, with argon (99.996%) carrier gas and a thermal conductivity detector. As discussed above, a dynamic technique was utilized in order to kinetically suppress subsurface penetration by the adsorbate. The catalysts were treated in situ with 14% HaS/Ha at 350 for 30-60 min, cooled to ambient temperature under HaS/Ha, and purged there with argon for 5 min. In many experiments with MoSa catalysts, we have found that varying the duration of this purge over a wide range does not influence the results. Oz chemisorption was then measured at ambient temperature by the addition, at 2- to 3-min intervals, of 5-cm3 pulses of 10% Oz/argon (20.5 ^mole Oa/pulse) into the carrier gas just upstream of the catalyst with a microvolume value. Effluent Oz peaks increased to constant size, signifying saturation of the catalyst, and the total uptake was calculated. In some cases, BET surface areas and Oa adsorption capacities were determined for catalysts prior to activity testing. As com- pared with these values, those obtained with the activity-tested materials were sub- stantially lower. The catalytic data gave no evidence of deactivation once the catalyst had been brought to 350 and sampling commenced. Thus, loss in BET surface area and Oa adsorption capacity must occur during the first moments of contact with the feed, i.e., before the reaction temperature is established. Accordingly, the activity- tested sample provides a much better repre- sentation of the working catalyst. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Table 1 compiles the rate constants, sur- face areas of the activity-tested catalysts, and Oa chemisorption capacities of the ac- tivity-tested catalysts. Turning first to the preparations follow- ing Method A (metathetical reaction of MoCI^ and LizS) we observe that treating the dried precipitate ex situ in 15% HzS/Ha at 400 has no discernible effect on the resultant catalytic activity, but if this treat- ment is carried out at 700 (No. 5) the activity is substantially lowered. This is not surprising since treatment at the lower tem- perature leads to a poorly crystalline prod- uct (3) whereas the higher temperature gives well-crystallized MoSa. A similar ob- servation applies to a comparison of runs Nos. 6 and 7. Runs Nos. 8-12 pertain to preparations in which ammonium thiomolybdate was decomposed with aqueous, excess HCOOH at ambient temperature, followed by digestion at 50, filtering, washing of the precipitate, and vacuum drying at 150. The resultant activities vary over a threefold range despite approximately con- stant surface area. The catalyst in run No. 14 arose via the in situ decomposition of amonium thiomolybdate, while in runs Nos. 13 and 15, thermochemical decompo- sition was effected ex situ at 350-400. This is seen to have led to a large decrease in surface area, whereas catalytic activity was apparently unaffected. The above observations make it plain that the correlation between hydrodesulfur- ization activity and surface area is poor. This is manifest upon inspection of Fig. 1, which presents this correlation for 12 cata- lysts listed in Table 1. In addition to the absence of linearity, the scatter of the data around any curve is very large. A vastly improved correlation emerges if catalytic activity is plotted versus Oz chemisorption capacity, as shown in Fig. 2. The relationship, despite some scatter, is seen to be linear and furthermore appears to pass through the origin. Voorhoeve and Stuiver (5) have pro- posed that the edge plane in MoSz and WSa is the site of their hydrodesulfurization ac- tivity, based on ESR studies of NiS/WSz catalysts. Their model of pseudointercala- tion by Ni2'1' at the WSz edge plane was supported by electron micrographs ob- tained by Farragher and Cossee (6). The 518 NOTES 36 30 I I 24 18 12 204060^0OS SURFACE AREA, M^GM FIG. 1.

The poor correlation of activity with total surface area apparently reflects the fact that the edge plane/basal plane ratio is capable of wide variations among 5 10 15 20 25 30 0, ADSORPTION CAPACITY, (l MOLES/GM FIG. 2.
