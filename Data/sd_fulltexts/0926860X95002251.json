Keywords: Phenol; Methanol; Alkylation; Cerium oxide Alkylation of phenol provides many industrial intermediates such as agrochemicals and polymers. Cresols and xylenols, ring-methylated products, and anisole, oxygen- methylated, are produced by alkylation of phenol with methanol. Vapor-phase alkylation of phenol with methanol has been examined over various solid catalysts [ 1-16]. Among them strong acidic catalysts provided a wide variety of products including anisole, methylanisole isomers, cresols, and xylenols [ 6-9 ]. Weak acidic materials such as La2 (HPO4) 3 and BaSO4 catalyzed oxygen methylation to produce anisole [ 8 ]. In contrast to the acidic catalysts, basic catalysts or acid-base catalysts selectively produced o-cresol and 2,6-xylenol, ortho-methylates [1-5,10-16]. Basic magnesium oxide (MgO) is known as a selective ortho-methylation catalyst [ 1-4], and various mixed metal oxide systems based on MgO [ 1,4,5], Fe203 [ 10- 13], and V205 [ 14-16], which had acid-base character, have been reported to be effective ortho-methylation catalysts. On the other hand, cerium oxide (CeO2) alone is scarcely used as a main catalyst component [ 17-19], whereas it is widely used as an additive. A sodium-doped CeO2 catalyses oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane [ 17 ] and a partially reduced CeO2 shows activity for CO hydrogenation [ 18,19 ]. In our preliminary examination for alkylation of phenol with methanol over various oxides of rare earth metals, we * Corresponding author. 0926-860X/95/$09.50 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this paper, we describe the characteristic activities of CeO2 catalysts prepared by thermal decomposition of several cerium salts, compared with MgO catalysts. Each catalyst sample was prepared by thermal decomposition of a chemical reagent at 550 for 2 h. All reagents, except for a commercial MgO, were supplied by Wako Chemical Ltd., and the MgO was supplied by Ube Industries Ltd., Japan. The alkylation of phenol with methanol was carried out in a usual fixed bed-flow reactor under atmospheric pressure of helium flow (50 mmol h- ' ) conditions at a reaction temperature of 500. Prior to the reaction, a catalyst sample ( 100 mg) was preheated in a glass tube reactor at 500 for 1 h. A reaction mixture of phenol and methanol with a molar ratio of 1:4 was fed into the reactor at a total flow rate of 25 mmol h- '. The catalytic activity was evaluated by an average conversion of phenol for 3 h after the reaction mixture had been fed for 2 h. Fig. 1 shows changes in catalytic activities over CeO2 and MgO with time on stream at a reaction temperature of 500. For MgO, which is known as a selective catalyst for o-alkylation of phenol, the conversion of phenol (curve c) decreased with time on stream. For every CcO2 catalyst we tested, however, the conversion of phenol gradually increased with time on stream in the initial reaction period for 2 h, and then the conversion level attained a steady value, as shown in curves a and b of Fig. 1. The conversion of phenol obtained over CeO2 was found to be higher than that over MgO. Table 1 summarizes specific surface areas and catalytic activities of various catalysts. Although a specific surface area of a commercial CeO2 was much smaller than that of a commercial MgO, the conversion of phenol obtained over the CcO2 was higher than that over the MgO.

In contrast to the 3-valent cerium salts, CeO2 prepared from such a 4-valent cerium salt as Ce(NHa)z(NO3)6 had relatively lower specific surface area than the others. In the series of CeO2, phenol conversion increased with the increase in specific surface area of the sam- pies. The selectivity to o-cresol decreased with the specific surface area, while the selectivity to 2,6-xylenol increased. A sum of the selectivities to o-cresol and 2,6- xylenol exceeded 97%. Another product was anisole with a selectivity of less than 1.0%, and the residuals were 2,4-xylenol and 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. We have preliminarily examined the methylation of phenol over various rare earth metal oxides. Sesquioxides such as La203, Sm203, and Ho203 and the other higher oxidation-state oxides such as Pr601~ and Tb407 were much less active. Among them HozO3 showed the highest phenol conversion of 3.2% with o-cresol selectivity of 67%. In a number of rare earth metal oxides, only CeO2 exhibited high ortho-selectivity and sufficient activity for the reaction. In conclusion, we found that CeO2 had excellent catalytic activity for o-meth- ylation of phenol with methanol. In particular, CeO2 prepared by decomposition of cerium(III) acetate exhibited excellent activity and ortho-selectivity without decay, compared to MgO catalyst which showed a significant decrease in activity with time on stream.
