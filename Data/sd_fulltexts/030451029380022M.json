Box 124, S-221 00 Lund (Sweden); tel. (+46-46)108280, fax. (+46-46)149156 (Received June 29, 1992; accepted December 21, 1992 ) Abstract A DRIFT study of the adsorption and the (amm) oxidation of toluene was carried out at 150300 C on a Ti02 (B)-supported vanadia catalyst with a loading corresponding to 1.9 mg V205 per m2 of the support surface area. In the absence of NH3 and gaseous oxygen, the adsorption of toluene at 150 C produces benzyl and benzoate intermediates. After one hour at the same temperature, further conversion of benzyl species, probably benzyloxy, into benzoate species is observed. Upon introduction of NH3 into the reaction cell, some benzonitrile is formed together with intermediates which possibly are (C6Hs)CH(NHZ)0- and (C6115)C(NHZ) (0-)2 species. Subsequent heat treatment at 300 C causes an increase in the amounts of benzonitrile and COZ formed and the simultaneous disappearance of the precursor intermediates. On the basis of identified intermediates and observed transformations, a mechanism for the partial (amm)oxidation of toluene is proposed. The formation of CO, is believed to pass over intermediates, which are identified as benzoquinone and butenolide species. Keywords: ammoxidation; DRIFT study; oxidation; supported catalyst; titania; toluene; vanadia catalyst Introduction Supported vanadium oxide catalysts, especially titania supported, are widely used for the partial oxidation and ammoxidation of alkyl aromatic compounds [ 1-4 ] . Possible mechanisms for these reactions have been presented in the literature [5-9], and IR studies of reaction intermediates and their transformations have been reported [ 10-16 ] . In the case of toluene oxidation, the latter studies, when carried out at elevated temperatures, have shown the formation of aldehyde-like intermediates and/or benzoate species [12,13,15,16]. In the initial stage of the reaction, sometimes spectral features were observed that were assigned to benzyl species [ 13,15,16 ] . In none of the *Corresponding author 0304-5102/93/$06.00 1993 - Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. All rights reserved. 52 M. Sanati and A. Andersson/J. Mol. Catal. 81 (1993) 51-62 investigations was clear evidence of the formation of benzyloxy species obtained. Despite this, there is general agreement that such a species is most likely formed as an intermediate in the oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde. On the IR studies of the ammoxidation of toluene to benzonitrile, there are differences in the results reported. Over a V,O5/A1203 catalyst, Niwa et al. [ 10 ] detected the formation of benzoate species, which were concluded to further react with ammonia in form of NH' (ad) to produce benzonitrile. The oxidative adsorption of toluene was considered to occur on V205, while the resulting benzoate species is stabilised on the surface of A1203. According to Busca et al. [ 13 ] , who studied the same reaction over vanadia support on Ti02 (Degussa P25 ), the main route for nitrile formation comprises the reaction of adsorbed benzyl species with coordinatively adsorbed NH3. First, a benzylamine intermediate is formed which then dehydrogenates to form benzonitrile, possibly via an imine intermediate. Azimov et al. [ 16 ] , who studied toluene ammoxidation over an alumina supported V-Sb-Bi catalyst, found that both benzyl and carboxylate species react with dehydrogenated ammonia species to form nitrile. They concluded, however, that the direct route from benzyl species was the most important under normal operating conditions. Earlier we found that Ti02 (B) was suitable as a support for vanadia when used in toluene ammoxidation [ 17 ] . Such catalysts were further characterised by the use of high-resolution electron microscopy [ 18 ] . Also, we have carried out a comprehensive kinetic investigation of toluene (amm)oxidation over a Ti02 (B)-supported vanadia monolayer catalyst [9 ] and, recently, for the same reaction, compared Ti02 (B ), anatase and rutile as support for vanadium oxide [ 19 ] . In the present work, the results of a DRIFT study of the (amm) oxidation of toluene on a vanadia/Ti02 (B) catalyst are reported. The measurements were performed for a range of temperatures (150-300 C) which is lower than that, 300-400 C, normally used for catalytic (amm) oxidation of alkylaromatics [ 1-4,17,18 ] . The reason for doing so was to simplify the situation and to provide information about intermediate species, i.e., the temperature should be high enough for toluene activation, but at the same time not too high to have a detectable concentration of reaction intermediates. For the study of ammoxidation, the toluene was adsorbed before NH3 was introduced. The reason for this was that pulse studies have shown that nitrile forms when pulsing NH3 over a surface with preadsorbed toluene [20] or 3-methylpyridine [21 ]. In both studies, much less nitrile was formed when the hydrocarbon was pulsed over a surface that had first been subjected to NH3. These experiments show that toluene activation is crucial for nitrile formation, and the procedure used in the present investigation permitted the study of this activation. The intermediates formed have been identified, and the results are used for mechanistic considerations. M. Sanati and A. Andersson/J Mol. Catal. 81 (1993) 51-62 53 Experimental Preparation of catalyst The Ti02 (B) support, which was prepared as described elsewhere [ 17 ] , was impregnated with an oxalic acid (Merck, p.A.) solution of NH4VOg (Merck, p.A. ). The deposited amount corresponds to 1.9 mg V205 per m2 of the support surface area and slightly exceeds the amount required for the formation of a theoretical monolayer [ 17 ] . The BET surface area of the support was 18.3 m2/ g and that of the catalyst was 11.0 m2/g. DRIFT experiments DRIFT spectra were recorded using a Mattson Polaris infrared spectrometer equipped with a Harrick Scientific Praying Mantis diffuse reflection attachment. Catalytic experiments were carried out in a reaction chamber made of stainless steel and supplied by Harrick Scientific. It was provided with KBr windows, which were mounted in a stainless steel dome. The sampling cup was at the top of a stainless steel rod, in which both the heating cartridge and the thermocouple were embedded. Gas ports were provided for evacuation and for introduction of reactants. The cell volume was approximately 20 cm' and the temperature was controlled with a Love 301 self-tune controller. Circulating water was used to cool the body of the reaction chamber. The pressure was measured with two MKS vacuum gauges. Before the adsorption experiments, undiluted sample was activated by evacuation at 300 C for 2 h. This treatment caused the complete removal of adsorbed water from the surface. The (amm) oxidation experiments were then carried out in the sequence as follows. First, toluene (Merck, p.A.) purified by multiple freeze-pump-thaw cycles was introduced up to a partial pressure of 30 Torr into the reaction chamber kept at 150 C. Spectra were recorded after 15 min and again after 1 h of heat treatment. Then, 02 (AGA, 99.6 vol.%) was dosed up to a partial pressure of 100 Torr, and a new spectrum was registered. Finally at 150 C, 100 Torr of NH3 (Alfax, 99.90 vol. %) was introduced, and new spectra were collected both at this temperature and after raising the temperature to 300 C. All spectra were recorded after evacuation of the reaction chamber for 5 min. A spectral resolution of 2 cm-1 was used, and 500 spectra were collected at each recording. ICON analytical software from Mattson Instruments was used for the spectral treatment. Adsorption of NH3 alone was studied both at 25 C and after heat treatment up to 200 C. Identification of spectral features, unless otherwise stated, was made consulting relevant chapters in Bellamy's textbook [ 22 ] . Results Adsorption and oxidation of toluene The catalyst was subjected to toluene for 15 min at 150 C.

In addition to the contribution from the solid phase, a broad band from adsorbed water with a maximum at 3300 cm-1 has been subtracted in spectra (a), (b ), and (c). and a broad band around 3300 cm-1, which is due to water formed. The observed frequencies are given in Table 1. Bands in the region 1600-1450 cm-1 are highly characteristic of the aromatic ring itself. The bands observed at 1598,1580,1498,1492, and 1447 cm-1 can be assigned to skeletal carbon-carbon stretching modes. Because the corresponding bands for toluene are at somewhat higher frequencies [14,15], it can be inferred that some electron density is withdrawn from the phenyl ring, M. Sanati and A. Andersson/J.

From the presence of additional bands at 2940 and 2840 cm-1, which are typical for the asymmetric and the symmetric v (C-H) vibrations of CH2 groups [22], respectively, it follows that the major intermediate seen in Fig. la is a benzyl species. In agreement with this assignment is the observation of a weak shoulder at 1580 cm-1, which is indicative of a substituent of low polarity [ 22 ] . Aromatic carboxylic acids have v (C=O) bands in the region 1700-1680 cm-1. In water solutions ionisation of the acid occurs, resulting in an equilibrium of the two carboxylic oxygen atoms. Therefore, the characteristic carbonyl adsorption disappears. Instead two new bands appear near 1610-1550 and 1420-1300 cm-1, which are from the asymmetrical and symmetrical vibrations of the COO- group. The shoulder at 1560 cm-1 and the band at 1415 56 M. Sanati and A. Andersson/J. Mol. Catal. 81 (1993) 51-62 cm-1, which are seen in Fig. la, thus, can be assigned to a benzoate intermediate with ring vibration bands superimposed on those of the predominant benzyl species. Phenyl v (C-H) bands are to be expected near 3070 and 3030 cm-1. It has been found that the relative intensities of the individual bands are functions of the inductive Hammet parameter, Q, of the ring [23]. Whereas the 3027 cm-1 band in ethyl benzene is twice as strong as that at 3065 cm-1, the reverse is true in nitrobenzene where the first band at 3031 cm-1 is very weak compared with the second, which is at 3077 cm-1. In the present study, Fig. la, the two v (C-H) bands are at 3075 and 3030 cm-1. The fact that these bands are of similar intensity is further confirmation of the formation of both a benzyl species as well as for a benzoate intermediate. In addition to these two species we observe a v (C=O) band at 1705 cm-1, which probably originates from physically adsorbed benzaldehyde [24]. Also, a band appears at 1662 cm-1, which can arise from the C=O stretching in adsorbed benzoquinone [ 24 ] . This compound has been reported to be formed as a minor product in the oxidation of toluene over vanadia-titania catalysts [ 18,25 ] . After further heating for 1 h at 150 C and subsequent evacuation, the spectrum in Fig. lb was recorded. Considering the frequencies observed, Table 1, it can be concluded that, besides the benzoate intermediate, the adsorbed benzyl species is still present. When compared with the spectrum obtained after 15 minutes, Fig. la, there is now more of the benzoate intermediate and less of the benzyl intermediate. The carboxylate band at 1415 cm-1 has increased in intensity, and so has the shoulder at 1560 cm-1. In agreement with this transformation, the band around 1600 cm-1 is now more intense and clearly split into two components at 1598 and 1580 cm-1. Also, the band at 3075 cm-1 is the most intense of the two aromatic v (C-H) bands. Consequently, the methylene v (C-H) bands at 2940 and 2840 cm-1 have decreased in intensity due to further reaction of benzyl species forming carboxylate species. Another effect of the prolonged heating at 150 C is that the C=O stretchings at 1705 and 1662 cm-1, proposed to arise from adsorbed benzaldehyde and benzoquinone, respectively, have increased in intensity. The broad and poorly resolved band, or bands, in the region 1800-1750 cm-1 cannot be from maleic anhydride since there is no additional ;zt 1860 cm-1 band, but possibly from a butenolide precursor [ 24 ] . Subsequent treatment with oxygen at 150 C caused only a few changes in spectral features, Fig. lc. A slight increase of the amounts of benzoquinone and butenolide species formed together with a decrease of aldehyde species is observed. The formation of C02 is evident from the presence of the band with Btype contour at 2361 and 2344 cm-1 [ 26 ] . Adsorption of NH, The spectrum obtained after adsorption of NH3 on the activated sample at 25 C and following evacuation at the same temperature is shown in Fig. 2. M. Sanati and A. Andersson/J. Mol.

Infrared subtraction spectra recorded after adsorption of NH3 (100 Torr) at 25 C and the following consecutive treatments, each of which was followed by evacuation for 5 min: (a) 25 C, 30 min; and (b) 100 C, 30 min. The bands at 3395, 3267 and 1605 cm-1 are from the asymmetric and symmetric stretching, and the degenerate deformation, respectively, of NH3 coordinatively adsorbed on Lewis acid sites [ 26 ] . At 1425 cm-1 there is an intense band, which is a NH4 degenerate deformation band [ 26 ] . Subsequent heat treatment at 100 C causes a strong decrease of the 6d(NH4) band, whereas the intensity of the bands from coordinatively bonded NH3 are less affected. A further increase in temperature led to a strong decrease in the intensities of all the bands, and no bands remained when 200 C was reached. Ammoxidation After adsorption and reaction of toluene at 150 C, spectra a-c in Fig. 1, the sample was exposed to gaseous NH3 for one hour. Figure Id shows the subtraction spectrum that was recorded after evacuation. The corresponding frequencies are collected in Table 1. Contact with NH3 causes almost complete disappearance of the bands which are typical of the adsorbed benzyl (2940, 2840 cm-') and benzoate (1560, 1415 cm-1) species. The 1662 cm-' band, which was assigned to adsorbed bensoquinone, remains intense and so does the COZ band with peaks at 2361 and 2344 cm-1. The bands at 1778 and 1705 cm-1 that were assigned to butenolide and aldehyde, respectively, also disappear because of either desorption or reaction. Cavalli et al. [7] have reported selective conversion of benzaldehyde with NH3 producing benzonitrile. As was shown in Fig. 2, adsorbed NH3 gives bands that can interfere with 58 M. Sanati and A. Andersson/J Mol. Catal. 81 (1993) 51-62 those of the phenyl ring and its substituents. However, the presence of the intermediates formed from preadsorbed toluene must reduce the amount of NH3 that can adsorb. Also, considering the finding that the amount of adsorbed NH3 strongly decreases above 100 C, we are inclined to interpret the spectrum in Fig. ld mainly on the basis of products that possibly can form from reaction of the hydrocarbon intermediates with ammonia species. The presence of bands at 1601 and 1447 cm-1, and of shoulders at 3075 and 1580 cm-1 clearly shows the existence of phenyl species. Formation of benzonitrile upon introduction of NH3 is confirmed by the v (C---N) band at 2230 cm-1. Besides the nitrile, another aromatic intermediate is adsorbed, which gives the two bands at 3348 and 3267 cm-1. These bands can be assigned to vg(NH2) and vg (NH2) modes, respectively. The corresponding deformation mode is seen as a shoulder at 1649 cm-1. The NH2 stretchings are not from a benzamide intermediate because of the comparatively small( Pa- vg) separation. For benzamide the two bands are at 3365 and 3172 cm-1, while they are at 3370 and 3290 cm-1 for benzylamine [22 ]. In Fig. ld there is only a slight indication of a shoulder around 2900 cm 1, a fact which infers that not more than one hydrogen atom is attached to the methyl carbon atom [ 22,24 ] . Probably, the predominant species is completely without such hydrogens since it has been formed from the main precursor species, a benzoate intermediate (Fig. lc). Consequently, the major species seen can be a (C6H5)C (NHZ) (O-)2 complex. The minor species can be a (C6H5) CH (NH2) O-intermediate. It cannot be excluded that a dehydrogenated species with a =NH group attached is also present. These groups have one v(N-H) vibration around 3350-3320 cm-1, and the band associated with the v (C=N) vibration falls within 1670-1620 cm-1 [24]. Unfortunately, no information could be obtained from the region of v (C-O-) vibrations due to the strong absorption of the catalyst in the region below 1400 cm-1. The band at 1530 cm-1 is probably not a skeletal vibration mode ( ,: 1500 cm-1), but more likely from an intermediate with a nitro group attached. Subsequently, the temperature was raised to 300 C. The subtraction spectrum in Fig. le was recorded after heat treatment for 1 h followed by evacuation for 5 min. Further conversion of the intermediates into benzonitrile (2230 cm-1) and C02 (2361, 2344 cm-1) obviously has occurred, cf. Table 1. The origin of the band at 1743 cm-1 is not clear. Formation of water is clearly seen from the appearance of a peak at 1590 cm-1 and a broad band in the 36003000 cm-1 region [24,26]. The bands disappeared after prolonged evacuation. Discussion Our previous infrared study [ 17 ] has shown the catalyst to have some weak v (OH) bands originating from the support itself. These bands were found to disappear when evacuating at 300 C [ 19 ] . No corresponding bands from V-OH groups were ever seen. Upon adsorption and activation of toluene the M. Sanati and A. Andersson/J. Mol. Catal. 81 (1993) 51-62 59 concentration of surface hydroxyl groups possibly can increase as a result of abstraction of hydrogen atoms from the methyl group. Such an increase was observed in a previous investigation [ 15 ] . In the present study, no v (OH) bands from the active phase could be distinguished after toluene adsorption, but a broad featureless band with a maximum around 3300 cm-1 appeared. This band, which is due to formed water, has been subtracted in spectra a-c in Fig. 1 to improve other features. Spectra a, b, and c show that toluene at 150 C, after an initial abstraction of a methyl hydrogen atom, is adsorbed as a benzyl species. Upon prolonged treatment at the same temperature and reaction with oxygen, the benzyl species is converted to a benzoate intermediate. Previous investigations of toluene adsorption, using Degussa P25 [ 13 ] and Japan Aerosil P25 [ 15 ] as supports for vanadia, have shown formation of benzyl species to occur even at room temperature. In both studies, formation of carboxylate-like structures was observed at higher temperatures. A similar result was obtained when toluene was adsorbed on a V-Sb-Bi catalyst [ 16 ] . These observations are in complete agreement with those of the present investigation. However, in another study [ 12 ] of toluene oxidation over a Degussa P25 supported vanadia monolayer catalyst in the range 20-200 C, the formation of benzyl species was not reported. In that case, the assignments were made to adsorbed aldehyde, carboxylate-like structures, and benzoate species. Niwa et al. [ 10 ] studied the adsorption of toluene on a V205/A1203 catalyst at 400 C. They reported a benzoate ion to be predominant at this temperature, a result that is in line with the temperature dependent transformation that was mentioned above. As a first step in the (amm)oxidation route, Fig. 3, we propose adsorption of toluene followed by an abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the methyl group giving a benzyl group bonded to a vanadium atom. Probably, the phenyl ring interacts with another adjacent vanadium atom because compared with toluene [ 14,15 ] a small wavenumber shift was observed for the skeletal C-C modes. However, it is well known that benzyl-vanadium [27] and benzyltitanium [ 28 ] bonds are unstable above s: 100 C. Therefore, most likely a rearrangement occurs and the benzyl species, identified on the basis of spectra a, b, and c in Fig. 1, can be a benzyloxy species. In our case, no unequivocal assignment to such a species can be made, because no information was obtained from the v (C-O-) wavenumber region due to the comparatively strong absorption of titania. However, a benzyloxy species is a most probable precursor for the aldehyde and carboxylate species, which clearly were found to form after prolonged treatment. Also without any definite evidence, other investigators have proposed the benzyloxy species to be an intermediate for benzaldehyde formation [ 12,13,15 ] . In Fig. 3, the formation of benzaldehyde and benzoic acid via the benzyloxy intermediate has been indicated. In toluene oxidation, the ratio of aldehyde to acid in the product strongly depends on the residence time [ 29 ] . Upon introduction of NH3, the aldehyde and carboxylate intermediates 60 M.

Reaction scheme for oxidation and ammoxidation of toluene. were found to react forming intermediates with an -NH, group attached, Fig. 1d. In the mechanism proposed in Fig. 3, taking into consideration the type of precursor species, the intermediates formed have been given as (C,,H5) CH (NH2) O- and (C,HS) C (NH2) (O-) 2 intermediates. The fact that methylene v (C-H) bands are almost absent, Fig. ld, indicates that the latter species is most abundant. A benzylamine intermediate was observed by Busca et al. [ 13 ] in their ammoxidation study. These investigators observed distinct methylene v (C-H) bands. For the proposed scheme we cannot make a definite decision on which type of ammonia species reacts, since we did not obtain any clear information on this. We only found weak infrared bands of adsorbed NH3 at 150 C in the absence of toluene intermediates. However, at lower temperatures, coordinatively adsorbed NH3, as well as NH' species, could be identified in agreement with previous studies [ 13,30 ] . With increase in temperature, coordinatively adsorbed NH, seemed to be the most stable form. Busca M. Sanati and A. Andersson/J. Mol. Catal. 81 (1993) 51-62 61 et al. [ 13 ] have concluded that coordinatively adsorbed N113 is involved in the ammoxidation mechanism, while Niwa et al. [10] considered NH4 (ad) to be active. Recently, Ramis et al. [31] have assigned bands to an -NHZ species, which appeared after adsorption of NH3 on a vanadia/titania catalyst and evacuation at 520 K. Azimov et al. [ 16 ] also observed that dehydrogenation of NH3 occurs on V-Sb-Bi oxide at 200-300 C. Therefore, dehydrogenated species can possibly be involved in the ammoxidation pathway. Participation of imido =NH species, as has frequently been proposed [ 16,32 ] , cannot be excluded, especially under steady state conditions at high temperatures. Theoretical calculations have shown that imido species can form on V205 (010) surfaces [ 33 ] . Formation of nitrile from the observed intermediates clearly occurs upon heating, which is evidenced by the appearance of a v (C---N) band at 2230 cm-1, Figs. ld and le. Even though we did not obtain any direct evidence for dehydrogenation of the -NH2 group to =NH, nitrile formation logically should pass over such a step. Therefore, the formations of imine and a (C6HS) C (NH) Ospecies have been included in the mechanism in Fig. 3. Azimov et al. [ 16 ] assigned a band at 1660 cm-1 to an imine species. In our study, we detected a band at 1662 cm-1 (Table 1) which, however, was already present before the treatment with NH3. Besides partial (amm)oxidation products, formation of COz (2361, 2344 cm-1) was observed as a result of degradation of the phenyl ring. Precursor intermediates for COZ could be the identified benzoquinone (1662 cm-1) and butenolide (1778 cm-1) species. Butenolide is a likely precursor for maleic anhydride. In a reaction network study of toluene oxidation [5], C02 was thought to be formed in a rake mechanism over bensoquinone and maleic anhydride intermediates. The mechanism proposed is based on the identification of intermediates and their transformations observed in the temperature range 150-300 C. When we adsorbed toluene at 250 C, formation of benzoate species was predominant together with intermediates obtained from degradation of the phenyl ring. Upon introduction of NH, the benzoate intermediate reacted directly with nitrile and no information on the intermediates in the transformation was obtained. Niwa et al. [ 10 ] found similar results at 400 C. The question remains whether the transformations observed under the experimental conditions of the infrared measurements are also those that are responsible for nitrile formation in the industrial process under steady state conditions at 350-400 C. Under steady state conditions in the presence of both N113 and toluene, the ammonia species probably interacts with the first toluene intermediate formed, i.e., the benzyl species. Support for this inference is given in our recent reaction kinetics investigation [ 9 ] . 62 M. Sanati and A. Andersson/J. Mol. Catal. 81 (1993) 51-62 References 1 G.C. Bond and P. Konig, J.

Box 124, S-221 00 Lund Sweden; tel. (+46-46)108280, fax. (+46-46)149156 * Corresponding author A DRIFT study of the adsorption and the (amm) oxidation of toluene was carried out at 150–300°C on a TiO2(B)-supported vanadia catalyst with a loading corresponding to 1.9 Mg V2O5 per m2 of the support surface area. In the absence of NH3 and gaseous oxygen, the adsorption of toluene at 150°C produces benzyl and benzoate intermediates. After one hour at the same temperature, further conversion of benzyl species, probably benzyloxy, into benzoate species is observed. Upon introduction of NH3 into the reaction cell, some benzonitrile is formed together with intermediates which possibly are (C6H5)CH(NH2)O- and (C6H5)C(NH2)(O-)2 species. Subsequent heat treatment at 300°C causes an increase in the amounts of benzonitrile and CO2 formed and the simultaneous disappearance of the precursor intermediates. On the basis of identified intermediates and observed transformations, a mechanism for the partial (amm)oxidation of toluene is proposed. The formation of CO2 is believed to pass over intermediates, which are identified as benzoquinone and butenolide species.
