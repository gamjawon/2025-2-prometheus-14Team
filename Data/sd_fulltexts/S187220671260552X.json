These were shown to be efficient and recyclable catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde in a thermoregulated PEG biphasic system, which allows for an efficient homogeâ€� neous catalytic reaction, easy biphasic separation and catalyst reuse. Under optimized reaction conditions, the conversion of cinnamaldehyde and the selectivity of hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCAL) were 99% and 98%, respectively. The PEG4000â€�stabilized Pd nanoparticle catalyst could be easily separated from the product by phase separation and reused eight times without evident loss of activity and selectivity.

Keywords: Thermoregulated poly(ethylene glycol) biphasic system Selective hydrogenation Palladium Nanoparticle Cinnamaldehyde Â Â Over the past decades, soluble transitionâ€�metal nanopartiâ€� cles in catalysts have attracted growing interest because of their highly catalytic efficiency and unique properties. Howevâ€� er, as with traditional homogeneous catalysts, one of the main disadvantages of soluble nanoparticle catalysts is the difficulty of recovering the catalysts from the products. To overcome this problem, several strategies have been disclosed. The liqâ€� uid/liquid biphasic system, i.e., aqueous/organic biphasic sysâ€� tem [1âˆ’3], Ï�luorous/organic biphasic system [4âˆ’6], and ionic liquid biphasic system [7âˆ’10] were most frequently used. Recently, a thermoregulated biphasic system composed of PEG and organic solvents has been developed. This allows for a highly efficient homogeneous catalytic reaction, easy biphasic separation and catalyst reuse because of the thermoregulated phaseâ€�transition property of the system. This system has been employed for the hydroformylation of olefins and selective hydrogenation of 1,5â€�cyclooctadiene by applying the PEGâ€�stabilized Rh or Pd nanoparticles to the catalysts [11,12]. The selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde is useful as the possible products of hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCAL) or cinnamâ€� yl alcohol (COL) are used in the synthesis of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals and fragrances. However, most studies on this transformation have concentrated on transitionâ€�metal heteroâ€� geneous catalysts or homogeneous complex catalysts [13âˆ’18]. As a continuation of previous works and to best use the therâ€� moregulated PEG biphasic system containing soluble transiâ€� tionâ€�metal nanoparticles, this study focused on PEG 4000â€�stabilized Pd nanoparticle catalyzed selective hydroâ€� genation of cinnamaldehyde in a thermoregulated PEG biphasic system. * Corresponding author.

Catal.,Vol. 34, No. 4, April 2013 NIU Mingming et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 674â€“678 Pd nanoparticles stabilized by PEG4000 were prepared. A mixture of PdNa2Cl4Â·xH2O (containing 30% Pd, 1.77 mg, 0.005 mmol) and PEG4000 (2.0 g, 0.5 mmol) was added to a 75 ml stainlessâ€�steel autoclave. The autoclave was flushed three times with 2.0 MPa hydrogen and stirred under hydrogen (4.0 MPa) at 70 Â°C for 2 h. The reactor was then cooled to room temperaâ€� ture and depressurized. The PEG4000â€�stabilized Pd nanopartiâ€� cles obtained were used for the selective hydrogenation of cinâ€� namaldehyde. Selective hydrogenation reactions were performed in a 75 ml stainlessâ€�steel autoclave. The PEG4000â€�stabilized Pd nanoâ€� particles (0.005 mmol), cinnamaldehyde (5 mmol), toluene (3.0 g), nâ€�heptane (1.0 g) and nâ€�decane (0.2 g) were added to the autoclave and purged three times with hydrogen at 2.0 MPa. The autoclave was then pressurized with hydrogen to the deâ€� sired pressure and held at a set temperature with stirring in a thermostatic oil bath for the desired length of time. After the reaction, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature and depressurized. The upper organic phase was separated from the lower PEG phase by phase separation and analyzed by GC and GCâ€�MS. Gas chromatography analyses were performed on a Tianmei 7890 GC instrument (Shanghai Techcomp Instrument Ltd, Shanghai, China) equipped with a 50 m OVâ€�101 column (inner diameter 0.25 mm) and an FID detector (N2 as a carrier gas). GCâ€�MS measurements were performed on an HP 6890 GC/5973 MSD instrument (with a 30 m HPâ€�5MS column, inner diameter 0.25 mm; He as a carrier gas). The transmission elecâ€� tron microscopy (TEM) images were taken with a Tecnai G 2 20 Spirit microscope at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV (FEI company). ICPâ€�AES analyses of Pd were carried out on an Opâ€� tima 2000 DV (Perkin Elmer, USA). Cinnamaldehyde has two reactive sites for hydrogenation (C=C and C=O bonds). Selective hydrogenation of the C=C bond yields hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCAL), while selective hydroâ€� genation of the C=O bond delivers cinnamyl alcohol (COL). If hydrogenation takes place at both C=C and C=O bonds, hydroâ€� cinnamyl alcohol (HCOL) will form (Scheme 1). The schematic illustration of selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde in a thermoregulated PEG biphasic system containing PEG4000â€�stabilized Pd nanoparticles is shown in Fig. 1. At room temperature, the lower PEG phase containing the Pd nanoparticles was immiscible with the upper organic phase consisting of toluene and nâ€�heptane with the cinnamaldehyde substrate (left panel in Fig. 1). It was noted that when the temâ€� perature was elevated gradually to the reaction temperature, the biphasic system merged into a single phase and the reacâ€� tion proceeded in a homogeneous phase (central panel in Fig. 1). Finally, by decreasing the temperature to room temperature after the reaction was completed, the system recovered to biâ€� phasic form (right panel in Fig. 1). The product and the catalyst were easily collected from the organic and PEG phase, respecâ€� tively. The recovered catalyst can be reused without further purification or activation. The optimal reaction conditions for PEG4000â€�stabilized Pd nanoparticle catalyzed selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldeâ€� hyde in a thermoregulated PEG biphasic system were first deâ€� termined. As shown in Table 1, the conversion of cinnamaldeâ€� hyde increases with increasing temperature (entries 1âˆ’4). At 120 Â°C, the conversion of cinnamaldehyde and the selectivity of Scheme 1.

NIU Mingming et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 674â€“678 HCAL were 99% and 98%, respectively. The effects of hydrogen pressure on the reaction were studied. In the range of 1.0âˆ’4.0 MPa, the conversion of cinnamaldehyde increased with inâ€� creasing hydrogen pressure (entries 4âˆ’7). It is also evident from Table 1 (entries 4, 8âˆ’10) that prolonging reaction times led to an increased conversion of cinnamaldehyde. In all invesâ€� tigated cases, the selectivity of HCAL was higher than 97% and no COL was observed. Compared with previously reported Pd, Rh, Ru or Ir catalysts [17âˆ’20], PEG4000â€�stabilized Pd nanopartiâ€� cle catalysts in a thermoregulated PEG biphasic system are more active. The recycling efficiency of PEG4000â€�stabilized Pd nanopartiâ€� cle catalysts was also investigated. After the reaction, the upper organic phase was separated from the lower cataâ€� lystâ€�containing phase by simple phase separation. The lower catalystâ€�containing phase was directly used in the next reaction run. Under the identical reaction conditions to entry 4 in Table 1, the recovered Pd nanoparticles exhibited highly catalytic efficiency without evident loss of activity or selectivity after the catalyst was reused eight times (Fig. 2). TEM images of newly prepared Pd nanoparticles and after eight recycles showed a slight increase of particle size from original (1.9 Â± 0.5) nm to (2.0 Â± 0.5) nm (Fig. 3). The leaching of transitionâ€�metal nanoparticle catalysts is a significant concern in these transformations. This paper studâ€� ied Pd leaching in recycle experiments by determining the Pd content in the upper organic phase at the end of the reaction. The leaching of Pd was detected by ICPâ€�AES and the results indicated that the leaching of Pd was under the minimum deâ€� tectable amount (0.003 Î¼g/ml). PEG4000â€�stabilized Pd nanoparticle catalysts in a thermoregâ€� ulated PEG biphasic system were shown to be highly active, selective and recyclable for the selective hydrogenation of cinâ€� namaldehyde towards HCAL. Considering the extensive appliâ€� cations of Pd nanoparticle catalysts, the thermoregulated PEG biphasic system containing PEGâ€�stabilized Pd nanoparticles should find more uses in other catalytic reactions.

The PEG4000-stabilized Pd nanoparticle catalyst could be easily separated from the product by phase separation and reused eight times without evident loss of activity and selectivity. 摘要 将具有“高温混溶、室温分相”功能的聚乙二醇4000(PEG4000)与甲苯-正庚烷组成的两相体系用于纳米钯催化的肉桂醛选择性加氢反应中. 在优化的反应条件下, 14;肉桂醛转化率和氢化肉桂醛选择性分别为99%和98%. 钯纳米催化剂经简单分相即可与产物分离, 14;且循环使用8次, 14;其活性和选择性基本保持不变. 14; Graphical abstract Poly(ethylene glycol)-stabilized Pd nanoparticles were demonstrated to be efficient and recyclable catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde in a thermoregulated PEG biphasic system.
