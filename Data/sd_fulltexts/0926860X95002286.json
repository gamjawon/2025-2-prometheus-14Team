Corma *, A. Martinez, C. Martinez lnstituto de Tecnologfa Qufmica, UPV-CSIC, Universidad Polit~cnica de Valencia, Avda. de los Naranjos s/n, 46022 Valencia, Spain Received 30 July 1995; accepted 14 September 1995 Abstract The liquid phase alkylation of isobutane with 2-butene has been carried out at 50 reaction temperature and 2.5 MPa total pressure on three steam dealuminated USY catalysts with unit cell sizes (UCS) ranging from 24.55 to 24.31 ,~. These catalysts, which contained the extraframework aluminum (EFAL) generated during the steam stabilization, were subjected to an (NH4) 2SiF6 (AHF) treatment to selectively remove the EFAL. The catalysts were characterized by XRD and IR spec- troscopy with adsorbed pyridine. It has been shown that the AHF treatment is more effective in removing cationic EFAL species, which are the predominant species in mildly steamed USY samples, than for extracting condensed type EFAL present in highly dealuminated USY catalysts. The char- acteristics of the high UCS sample after the AHF treatment depended strongly on the conditions of calcination used after the treatment. Elimination of EFAL in mildly dealuminated USY samples caused a decrease of the initial cracking and alkylation activity, and increased the deactivation rate of the zeolite. However, both the alkylation activity and the catalyst life improved after elimination of EFAL from the highly dealuminated catalysts. These results have been interpreted in terms of changes in BrCnsted acid site density and strength distribution produced after the AHF treatment on the different USY catalysts.

Therefore, replacement of such liquid acids by solid acid alkylation catalysts would be a milestone to allow refiners to increase the alkylation capacity that would be required to meet projected demands in the next years [ 1 ]. For this purpose different solid acids have been proposed as alkylation catalysts in the last decades [2]. Some of them, which are being tested at a pilot plant scale, are based on supporting typical liquid acids, i.e., H2SO4, or well known liquid superacids, i.e., SbFs, on suitable carriers [ 1,3]. Although this would represent an appreciable advantage with respect to the current technology, the environmental and corrosion problems are only partially solved, and these systems are not the final desired solution. From this point of view, zeolites [4-6] and solid superacids of the sulfated zirconia type [ 7 ] are more convenient. These catalysts were shown to exhibit a high activity and selectivity during the first stages of the alkylation reaction. After this initial period, the catalyst activity rapidly declined and dimeri- zation-oligomerization of the olefin feed prevailed over the 'true' alkylation. When used in a fixed bed continuous reactor, sulfated zirconia superacids were even less stable towards deactivation than zeolite catalysts [ 8 ]. Among the different zeolites studied, large pore zeolites are preferred over medium pore structures because the former favor the formation and diffusion of the desired high octane trimethylpentanes (TMP) at moderate temperatures [6]. Besides the pore size and zeolite structure, the framework composition of the zeolite ( Si/AI ratio), and therefore the number of B rOnsted acid sites and the acid strength distribution, was also seen to have an impact on activity, selectivity and deactivation during the continuous alkylation of isobutane with 2-butene [5 ]. However, it has already been reported that the presence of extraframework aluminum species (EFAL) generated during the dealumination processes can greatly influence the catalytic activity of USY zeolites for carbonium ion reactions, such as the cracking A. Corma et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 169-182 171 of pure compounds [9-11] or gasoil [ 11,12], the isomerization of alkanes and aromatics [ 13 ] and the transalkylation of alkylaromatics [ 14]. It is the aim of this work to investigate the effect of EFAL in steam dealuminated USY zeolites with different framework compositions during the continuous alkyl- ation of isobutane with 2-butene. For this purpose, three USY catalysts with dif- ferent framework Si/AI ratios have been prepared by steam-calcination at different severity (500, 700 and 750, respectively). These samples, which contained all the EFAL generated during the dealumination, were then treated with an ammonium hexafluorosilicate (AHF) solution with the (NH4) 2SiF6-to-zeolite ratio adjusted to selectively remove the EFAL without practically modifying the framework composition. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation and characterization of catalysts Sample USY-1 was obtained by calcination at 500 for 3 h of the commercial CBV-500 (NI-I4+ ) Y zeolite (PQ Corp.). Samples USY-2 and USY-3 were obtained by steam-calcination ( 100% steam) of USY- 1 at 700 / 3 h and 750 / 5 h, respec- tively. Then, portions of these samples were treated with a 0.4 M solution of (NH4)2SiF6 (AHF) as follows: the zeolite was first suspended in a 3 M acetate ammonium buffer solution and the suspension heated up to 75 at reflux. Then, the required amount of (NH4)2SiF6 solution adjusted to eliminate the EFAL was slowly added while stirring and the mixture heated up to 95 and maintained at this temperature during 3 h since the addition of AHF. After this, the solids were separated by filtration, extensively washed with hot deionized water and dried at 100 overnight. This treatment has been previously shown to extract EFAL with- out practically altering the framework composition [ 15 ]. The AHF-treated catalysts are denoted as USY-n-F. Then, the USY- 1-F sample was activated by two different methods before being introduced into the alkylation reactor: (a) static air calcina- tion in muffle at 500 for 3 h (sample USY-1-FM) and (b) calcination under dynamic vacuum (10-2 Torr) at 400 during 4 h (sample USY-1-FV). The highly dealuminated USY-2-F and USY-3-F samples were activated following the procedure (a). The framework composition of the final catalysts was calculated from the unit cell constant, ao, determined by X-ray diffraction (Philips PW/1830 spectrometer, Cu Ka radiation) and following the ASTM D-3942-80 procedure. The crystallinity was calculated from the area of the (5,3,3) reflection considering the Na-Y CBV- 100 sample (PQ Corp.) as 100% crystalline. Chemical analysis were performed by atomic absorption spectroscopy in a SpectrAA- 10 Plus (Varian) spectrometer. 172 A. Corma et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 169-182 Infrared spectroscopic measurements were carried out on a Nicolet 710 FI'IR spectrometer equipped with data station. Wafers of 10 mg cm-2 were introduced into a conventional greaseless IR cell and pretreated in vacuum at 400 overnight. Then the spectra in the 4000-1300 cm - 1 region was recorded at room temperature. For pyridine adsorption experiments, 6.66- 102 Pa of pyridine were introduced into the cell at room temperature and after reaching equilibrium, the samples were outgassed at 250, 350 and 400 under vacuum and the spectra recorded at room temperature. 2.2. Catalytic experiments The alkylation of isobutane ( > 99% pure) with trans-2-butene ( > 99% pure) was carried out in a computer controlled unit with a fixed bed stainless steel tubular reactor heated by an electric furnace with three independent heating zones. The experiments were performed in the liquid phase at 2.5 MPa total pressure, 50 reaction temperature, isobutane/2-butene molar ratio of 15 and 2-butene space velocity (WHSV) of 1 h-1. The catalysts (8 g of zeolite having 0.59-0.84 mm particle size diluted with 8 g of inert silica) were pretreated at 450 in nitrogen flow before starting a run, except the sample USY-1-FV previously calcined in vacuum, which was activated at 150 during 10 h. At the reactor outlet, reactants and products are depressurized, heated at 200 and analyzed 'on-line' in a GC equipped with a multiloop sampling system, in such a way that once the first front of products are detected they are trapped in the first loop (we consider this time as 1 min time on stream). Then, the other loops (up to a maximum of 8) are filled with products taken at different times on stream (TOS) according to a programmed set up. A more detailed description of the experimental procedure and reaction system can be found elsewhere [ 5 ]. Once the experiment has finished, the loops are automatically analyzed in the GC, and reactants and products are separated in a 100 m capillary column (fused silica, Supelco). The individual C4-C8 compo- nents were identified by means of GC-MS and available standard mixtures. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Characterization of catalysts The physicochemical properties of the different USY catalysts are given in Table 1. After the AHF treatment of USY-1 a slight decrease of the unit cell constant, ao, from 24.55 to 24.53 ]k is observed, indicating that some framework dealumination also took place together with the extraction of EFAL. According to the chemical and XRD analyses, sample USY-1-F do not contain EFAL species. As shown in Table 1, the characteristics of the final catalyst depended on the conditions of calcination used. Thus, calcination in muffle at 500 (sample USY- A. Corma et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 169-182 173 1-FM) produced a larger reduction of the crystallinity and unit cell size than calcination in vacuum at 400 (sample USY-1-FV). This results, in the former case, in the formation of an appreciable proportion of EFAL species. On the other hand, the AHF treatment on the more dealuminated USY-2 and USY-3 catalysts decreased the crystallinity and zeolite UCS and, in contrast with USY-1, did not remove all the EFAL species. This indicates that in severely steamed USY catalysts, which contain different types of EFAL species as evidenced by 27A1 MAS-NMR [16], there is a type of EFAL (probably highly condensed species) that can be hardly removed by AHF treatment without seriously damaging the zeolite structure. The IR spectra in the OH region of the EFAL containing USY samples showed the expected IR bands at ca. 3745 cm- 1 (external sylanols), 3630 cm- ~ (HF) and 3545 cm-~ (LF), the latter two bands associated to OH attached to framework aluminum. In addition, the IR spectrum of the less dealuminated USY-1 (Fig. la) also shows other bands at ca. 3670 cm- ~ (internal or sylanol defects), 3600 cm- i and 3525 cm- i. After adsorption of pyridine and desorption at 250, non acidic OH groups remain in the spectrum (Fig. lb), while the difference spectrum (Fig. lc) shows that besides the HF and LF bands, some of the hydroxyls at 3600 cm- ~ and those at 3525 cm- ~ also have an acidic character. The latter two bands have been attributed [ 15 ] to the interaction of cationic EFAL species with the HF and LF hydroxyl groups, respectively, as represented below [ 15,17,18]: H : ..- Al(O,Oh'~\" -- 0 ~ jO.~. SiJ O-- -- oJ ~ooj \\ o-- This interaction causes a 30 cm-~ shift of the HF and LF bands towards lower frequencies. These OH associated to the presence of cationic EFAL were seen to retain pyridine at higher temperatures than the HF and LF hydroxyls, indicating a stronger acid character [ 15 ]. Fig. 1-2a-c shows the IR spectra of USY-1 after the AHF treatment and before calcination (sample USY-l-F). It is seen that after this treatment the intensity of the HF and LF bands strongly increases, while the bands at ca. 3670, 3600 and 3525 cm- ~ almost disappeared, indicating that most of the EFAL has been removed, in accordance with the results of Table 1. The increase of the intensity of HF and LF bands also indicates the presence of cationic type EFAL that was neutralizing part of the framework charge in the USY-1 catalyst. The changes produced in the IR spectra of the EFAL-free USY-1-F sample after calcination in static air and dynamic vacuum can also be observed in Fig. 1-3 and Fig. 1-4, respectively. The IR spectra of USY-1-FM strongly resembles those of the parent USY- l, except that the relative intensity of the band at ca. 3600 cm- ~ with respect to the HF and LF bands is higher in the latter sample, in agreement with its higher EFAL content, These results show that the static calcination generates new EFAL species having a nature similar to those present in the parent USY- 1 catalyst. These species can be 174 A. Corma et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 169-182 Ikl ) Z m 0 u) m < 3coo 3146 a | I I I 3900 3300 WAY ENUMBER (cm-l) 3 2 3430 ?

This would suggest the formation of a small amount of cationic EFAL compensating framework charge in USY-1-FV. On the other hand, the AHF treatment also produced an increase of the intensity of HF and LF hydroxyls in samples USY-2 (Fig. 2) and USY-3 (spectra similar to those of USY-2 and not shown), as a consequence of the elimination of cationic EFAL compensating framework charge.

Finally, the acidity results given in Table 2 show that the concentration of Brensted acid sites strongly increases after the AHF treatment in the three steamed catalysts, while the concentration of Lewis sites decreases in the case of USY-1 and increases for USY-2 and USY-3. The latter finding would suggest a redispersion of condensed type EFAL during the AHF treatment, thus increasing Lewis acidity. Moreover, it is seen that calcination of USY-1-F in static air at 500 strongly reduces the concentration of Brensted acid sites and increases Lewis acidity, while these changes occur in a much lower extent for the sample calcined in vacuum indicating a much lower dealumination extent during calcination. 3.2. Initial alkylation activity and selectivity Zeolites are known to gradually loss their activity during the alkylation reaction [4--6].

This can be achieved by using a reaction system such as that of this work, which allows to take samples of products from very short times on stream ( 1 min or less) where the alkylation activity of the zeolite is maximum. In this way, the initial ( 1 min TOS) 2-butene conversion and alkylate composition obtained on the different USY catalysts under the same experimental conditions are given in Table 3. It can be seen there that the initial 2-butene conversion is not greatly affected by the AHF treatment of USY-1 and calcination conditions of USY-1-F. However, clear differences arise when com- paring the product distribution initially obtained on these catalysts. Thus, sample USY- 1-FM (AHF treated and calcined in static air) show a lower cracking activity (C5-C7 compounds) and a slightly lower TMP/DMH ratio than the untreated USY- 1, but gives a very similar distribution of the TMP isomers, with the 2,2,4-TMP being the predominant isomer in both catalysts. On the other hand, USY-1-FV (AHF treated and calcined in vacuum) gives less cracked products and TMP, as well as a much lower TMP/DMH ratio, than the above two samples. In addition, a quite different distribution of TMP, with a much lower proportion of 2,2,4-TMP, is also observed for USY-1-FV as opposite to USY-1 and USY-1-FM. In contrast, the AHF treated USY-2-F and USY-3-F samples give a higher 2-butene conversion, as well as a higher cracking activity and alkylation selectivity (higher TMP/DMH ratio) than the untreated USY-2 and USY-3 catalysts, respec- tively (Table 3). Since trimethylpentanes (TMP) are the primary products from isobutane/2- butene alkylation, while dimethylhexanes (DMH) are mainly formed by dimeri- zation of 2-butene, the initial TMP/DMH ratio can be taken as a measure of the intrinsic alkylation/dimerization activity ratio of the zeolite. Then, it can be said A. Corma et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 169-182 177 that elimination of EFAL from the more dealuminated USY-2 and USY-3 samples increases the alkylation/dimerization activity ratio of the zeolite, while the contrary holds for the less dealuminated USY-1 catalyst. According to the characterization data already discussed, the BrCnsted acid site density of the steamed USY catalysts increases upon the AHF treatment, owing to the elimination of cationic EFAL species neutralizing part of the framework charge. In this sense, the AHF treated samples could be considered as USY zeolites with a 'higher framework A1 density' than their corresponding untreated counterparts. If this is so, and considering the different A1 sites that can exist in the faujasite structure [ 19] (xNNN sites, where x denotes the number of A1 atoms in the second coordi- nation sphere of a given framework aluminum), it appears that samples with higher FAL content than USY-2 and USY-3 (having 16 and 9 FAL/UC, respectively) will have a higher concentration of the strongest Brsted acid sites (0NNN plus 1NNN sites), whereas samples with higher framework A1 density than USY-1 (36 FAL/UC) will have a lower concentration of the strongest sites in favor of the sites of lower acidity (those having 2 or more AI in the second coordination shell). The parallelism between eliminating cationic EFAL compensating framework charge and increasing framework A1 density is in complete agreement with the acidity results presented in Table 2, i.e., the density of Brsted acid sites increases after the AHF treatment on all USY samples and the proportion of strong BrCnsted sites (those retaining pyridine above 350: desorption temperature) increases for USY-2-F and USY-3-F, and decreases for USY-1-FV. It has been reported [ 5 ] that the acid strength required to perform the different reactions occurring during isobutane/butene alkylation decreases in the order: cracking > alkylation > dimerization (oligomerization). Moreover, it was shown [5] that both the cracking and alkylation activities and the TMP/DMH ratio increase when increasing the UCS ofUSY zeolites from 24.26 to 24.50,~, indicating that these reactions occur on the strongest (0NNN and 1NNN) Brsted acid sites of the zeolite. This would explain the higher cracking activity and higher TMP/ DMH ratio of the AHF treated USY-2-F and USY-3-F samples with respect to USY-2 and USY-3, respectively. Furthermore, the opposite trends observed for USY-1-FV with respect to USY-1 may be ascribed to the lower concentration of strong BrCnsted acid sites in the former catalyst. However, it should be also taken into account that USY- 1-FV do not contain the very strong BrCnsted sites associated to the 3600 and 3525 cm- x IR bands attributed to the interaction of cationic EFAL with the HF and LF hydroxyls (Fig. 1-3). The contribution of these sites to the overall acidity of USY-1 was relatively high (Fig. 1-1c) and those vibrating at ca. 3600 cm- 1 were still present in the spectra of the AHF treated sample after calci- nation in static air at 500 (sample USY-1-FM). Then, the possible contribution of these sites of enhanced acidity to the higher cracking and alkylation activities of USY-1 and USY-1-FM with respect to the EFAL-free USY-1-FV catalyst can not be ruled out. 178 A.

Deactivation characteristics of USY catalysts The ageing characteristics of the catalysts has been studied by taking samples of product at different TOS. Thus, Fig. 3 shows the differential 2-butene conversion as a function of TOS for the different USY catalysts prepared. It is seen there that the stability of the USY zeolite towards deactivation depends not only on the framework composition [ 5 ], but also on the amount and type of EFAL generated during the steam dealumination. Then USY-1, which was shown to contain cationic EFAL species (some of them neutralizing framework charge, and other interacting with framework hydroxyls creating Br~nsted sites of enhanced acidity) is the most stable catalyst giving a very high conversion during the first 10 min on stream. Elimination of these EFAL species in USY-1 results in an increase of the deacti- vation rate of the zeolite (USY-1-FV). Sample USY-1-FM, which contains some EFAL species formed in the calcination step after the AHF treatment, shows a deactivation behavior intermediate between USY-1 and USY-I-FV, but much closer to the former catalyst, and is not shown in the figures for simplicity. The more dealuminated USY-2 and USY-3 catalysts deactivate at a faster rate than USY-1 due to the much lower hydrogen transfer activity and higher oligomerization activity of the low UCS samples [ 5 ]. Elimination of EFAL from the former catalysts increases both the initial 2-butene conversion and catalyst stability. Fig. 4 shows the concentration of TMP in the Ca fraction as a function of TOS for the different USY catalysts. It can be observed that elimination of EFAL from USY-1 has a negative effect on both the selectivity to TMP and the rate of decrease of TMP with TOS, while the AHF treated USY-2-F and USY-3-F samples show a A.

Same symbols as in Fig. 3. higher aikylation selectivity than their EFAL-containing counterparts in the range of TOS studied. The increase of alkylation selectivity after the AHF treatment is much less significant for the most dealuminated USY-3 catalyst than for USY-2. As it has been previously shown [ 5 ], both catalyst activity and stability increased when increasing the unit cell size of steamed USY zeolites, at least in the 24.26- o 24.50 A range studied. The gradual loss of alkylation activity during isobutane aikylation on zeolite catalysts is thought to occur by acid site poisoning due to heavy molecular weight hydrocarbons attached to the acid sites or blocking them. According to a recent spectroscopic study on a LaHY-FAU catalyst, these carbonaceous deposits are mainly aliphatic compounds formed by oligomerization of the olefin [20]. This study shows that intermolecular hydride transfer from isobutane is crucial to prevent oligomers formation by desorbing the carbenium ions as paraffins while leaving a tert.-butyl cation on the acid site. This further supports the idea that there is a close relationship between hydride transfer activity and catalyst deactivation. When the hydride transfer activity is lost, the carbenium ion desorbs as an olefin by giving back a proton to the catalyst, while interrupting the chain transfer: iso-C~--O-ZeO ~ iso-Cs= + H+O-ZeO and as a consequence, the olefinicity of the alkylate product raises. This can be observed in Fig. 5, where the concentration of isooctenes in the Ca fraction has been plotted as a function of TOS. The amount of olefins remains low during the initial reaction stages for the most active USY-1 and USY-1-FV catalysts and then rapidly increases after a given period of time, indicating the loss of hydrogen transfer 180 A.

It is also seen in Fig. 5 that the concentration of octenes is initially high for the less active USY-3 catalyst and rapidly increases from the initial stages of the reaction. The rate of formation of octenes decreases upon eliminating EFAL from USY-2 and USY-3, but it starts to increase at a shorter TOS after removing EFAL from USY-1. The amount of octenes is very low on both catalysts during the first min on stream, indicating a high initial hydrogen transfer activity. The increase of zeolite stability experienced in USY-2 and USY-3 after the AHF treatment can be related with the increase in BrCnsted acid site density. This in turn increases hydrogen transfer reactions, thus decreasing oligomers formation and, consequently, catalyst deactivation. It is known, for instance during catalytic crack- ing, that the rate of bimolecular processes, such as hydrogen transfer, increases when increasing the framework AI content of the zeolite [ 19], that is, when increas- ing BrCnsted acid site density. The faster deactivation rate and loss of hydrogen transfer activity observed for USY- 1-FV indicates a faster poisoning of the acid sites on this sample as compared to USY- 1, which may be related with a higher oligomerization activity of the former catalyst. This in turn may be ascribed to the changes in acid strength distribution towards weaker acid sites produced after elimination of EFAL in USY- 1, as it has been already discussed. Moreover, the higher dimerization-oligomerization activ- ity of USY-1-FV with respect to USY-1 could also be related with changes in the adsorption properties of the zeolites produced after the AHF treatment. The adsorp- tion characteristics of the zeolite were seen to depend on the framework composi- tion, with a preferential adsorption of olefins over paraffins as the framework AI content, or equivalently, the unit cell size (UCS), increases [21 ]. Then, it may occur that elimination of cationic EFAL neutralizing framework charge in USY-1 A. Corma et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 169-182 181 increases the 2-butene/isobutene adsorption ratio, thus decreasing the real isopar- affin/olefin ratio inside the zeolite pores and, consequently, favoring olefin dimer- ization-oligomerization versus isobutane/2-butene alkylation. 4. Conclusions The effect of the AHF treatment on both the physicochemical and catalytic properties of steam dealuminated USY catalysts were seen to depend on the amount and nature of the EFAL species present in the zeolite, which in turn depended on the severity of the steam dealumination step. Thus, the mildly steamed (500) USY-1 mainly contained cationic type EFAL. Some of these species were com- pensating part of the framework charge, but others were interacting with framework HF and LF hydroxyls creating BrCnsted sites of enhanced acidity (3600 and 3525 cm- ~ IR bands). Most of the EFAL in USY-2 and USY-3, which were steamed at a higher severity (700 and 750, respectively), would be as condensed alumina type species, although some cationic EFAL neutralizing framework charge was also present. After the AHF treatment, the density of BrCnsted acid sites increased for all the USY samples owing to elimination of charge compensating cationic EFAL, but some condensed type EFAL still remained on the more dealuminated catalysts. Calcination after the AHf treatment on the high UCS USY-1 must be carefully done in order to prevent further dealumination, and therefore formation of new EFAL species. The effect of EFAL on the catalytic properties for isobutane/2-butene alkylation strongly depended on the degree of dealumination (or UCS) of the USY samples. Thus, elimination of EFAL from the low UCS USY-2 and USY-3 increased the initial cracking and alkylation activities, as well as the TMP/DMH ratio and improved zeolite stability with TOS. On the contrary, the EFAL-free USY-1-FV sample showed a lower initial cracking and alkylation activities, much lower TMP/ DMH ratio and higher deactivation rate than the parent high UCS USY-1 catalyst. The positive effect of removing EFAL from the low UCS samples is explained by the increase of BrCnsted acid site density observed after the AHF treatment. This in turn increases the hydrogen transfer activity of the zeolites, thus favoring the desorption of the primary C8 carbocations and diminishing olefin oligomeri- zation. Contrarily, the increase of acid site density upon elimination of EFAL from the high UCS USY-1 sample occurs with a change of acid strength distribution towards lower acidities. This change may be associated with an increase of sites having 2 or more AI in the second coordination sphere (sites 2NNN, 3NNN .... ) of a given framework A1 as a result of removing cationic EFAL neutralizing framework charge, but may also be related with the elimination of hydroxyls of enhanced acidity vibrating at ca. 3600 and 3525 cm- 1 during the treatment. This could explain the lower activity for cracking and alkylation (both reactions requir- ing strong Br~nsted acid sites) of the EFAL-free USY-1-FV sample. This sample 182 A. Corma et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 169-182 also showed a faster loss of alkylation activity with TOS as compared to USY-1, which was ascribed to a higher oligomerization activity occurring on its weaker acid sites. Furthermore, differences in the adsorption properties of the zeolites before and after the AHF treatment may also be responsible for the differences in product distribution and catalyst stability observed for the high UCS samples.

The liquid phase alkylation of isobutane with 2-butene has been carried out at 50°C reaction temperature and 2.5 MPa total pressure on three steam dealuminated USY catalysts with unit cell sizes (UCS) ranging from 24.55 to 24.31 Å. These catalysts, which contained the extraframework aluminum (EFAL) generated during the steam stabilization, were subjected to an (NH4)2SiF6 (AHF) treatment to selectively remove the EFAL. The catalysts were characterized by XRD and IR spectroscopy with adsorbed pyridine. It has been shown that the AHF treatment is more effective in removing cationic EFAL species, which are the predominant species in mildly steamed USY samples, than for extracting condensed type EFAL present in highly dealuminated USY catalysts. The characteristics of the high UCS sample after the AHF treatment depended strongly on the conditions of calcination used after the treatment. Elimination of EFAL in mildly dealuminated USY samples caused a decrease of the initial cracking and alkylation activity, and increased the deactivation rate of the zeolite. However, both the alkylation activity and the catalyst life improved after elimination of EFAL from the highly dealuminated catalysts. These results have been interpreted in terms of changes in Brønsted acid site density and strength distribution produced after the AHF treatment on the different USY catalysts.
