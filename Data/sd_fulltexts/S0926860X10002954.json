Graphical abstract Mesoporous NiO prepared by a surfactant-assisted route has been proved to be catalytically active and selective for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. With this catalyst, an optimum propene yield of 13.2% was obtained at 450°C. The characterization results demonstrate that the densities of O− species and cation vacancies are much higher for this meso-NiO catalyst. Mesoporous NiO catalysts prepared by a surfactant-assisted route have been investigated in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propene; these catalysts are compared with two other NiO samples prepared by homogeneous precipitation and sol–gel method, respectively. Mesoporous NiO is proven to be an active and selective catalytic material with an optimum propene yield of 13.2% by the 25.8% propane conversion at 450°C. The propene selectivity remains around 50% in the temperature range from 400 to 550°C. XRD, N2 adsorption, TEM, O2-TPD, XPS and Raman characterizations have been used to study the intrinsic differences among these NiO catalysts. The results demonstrate that the densities of O− species and cation vacancies are much higher for the meso-NiO than for other samples; this difference is related to their different catalytic performances. Besides this, the efficient molecular transport by diffusion in the mesoporous channels also plays an important role during the ODHP reaction. Keywords Mesoporous NiO Oxidative dehydrogenation Propane Propene 1 Introduction As an important raw material in the modern chemical industry, propene is currently produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) [1]. Thermal dehydrogenation suffers from several drawbacks for the industrial standpoint, such as thermodynamics limitation, rapid coking and high reaction temperature. Now more and more attention is paid to the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propene [2–4], because the presence of oxygen can counteract the thermodynamic limitation and can prevent coking. One of the challenges for the process is how to achieve a high selectivity to propene with a high conversion of propane in the presence of oxygen, because propene is more reactive than propane and is prone to side reaction. Extensive studies have been made on supported vanadia or molybdena oxide catalysts for the ODHP reaction. Liu et al. [3–5] found that a V-containing catalyst with highly dispersed vanadia species on mesoporous silica exhibits a highly efficient catalytic performance for the ODHP reaction. However, most V- and Mo-based catalysts reported are active at rather high temperatures (T >500°C). Only a few studies [6,7] were concerned with 500°C or lower. Among other oxide systems, those containing nickel are also reported to be active and selective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of low alkanes, especially at lower temperatures [6–10]. In a previous works of our group, Wu et al. [10] prepared nanosized NiO particles that gave a C2H4 yield of 13% at 275°C in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE). Boizumault-Moriceau et al. [11] reported that CeNiO x precipitated catalyst exhibited the low-temperature performance for ODHP reaction, with 19.2% propane conversion at 300°C. Recently the synthesis and application of mesoporous materials have received more and more attention. These mesoporous materials exhibit high surface area, narrow pore size distribution and large pore volume, so that they can potentially be applied as catalysts [5]. Chao and Ruckenstein [7] have synthesized mesoporous V–Mg–O catalysts for ODHP reaction. The mesostructured V–Mg–O catalysts showed significantly higher selectivities and yields to propene at a low reaction temperature, compared with the mixed V–Mg oxide ones. Nickel oxide is one of the most investigated transition metal oxides, for it is used in catalysis, battery cathodes, and magnetic materials. Numerous works have been reported that synthesize nickel hydroxide and nickel oxide with different morphologies [12–20]. Banerjee et al. [14] firstly reported the synthesis of an ordered hexagonal mesoporous nickel oxide using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as the surfactant and urea as the hydrolyzing agent. According to this method, Xing et al. [16] have synthesized mesoporous NiO samples with a good capacitive behavior. So far, very limited works have been reported for the catalytic properties of NiO with special morphologies. The unexpected catalytic performance of NiO nanorings was reported by Wang et al. for CO oxidation [17]. Recently, we found that mesostructured NiO was more selective for ethylene formation in ODHE reaction, as compared to other nanosized NiO samples [20]. However, to our knowledge, no detailed studies have been made on the relationships among the structure, surface properties and catalytic behavior of NiO with special morphologies. Especially, no works have been reported about the catalytic properties of mesostructured NiO in the ODHP reaction. In this work, two mesoporous nickel oxides with different surface area were synthesized according to the literature method [14]. The mesoporous structure and surface properties of nickel oxide were characterized by XRD, N2 physical adsorption, O2-TPD, XPS techniques and laser Raman spectroscopy. For comparison, two other different NiO samples were synthesized by urea homogeneous precipitation [15] and by modified sol–gel method [8–10], respectively. The catalytic performances and the intrinsic differences of these synthesized catalysts for ODH of propane were investigated. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation All reagents were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. and used without further purification. The mesoporous nickel oxides were prepared using a similar procedure to that reported by Banerjee et al. [14]. Briefly, NiCl2·6H2O, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), urea and distilled water in a mole ratio of 1:2:30:60 were mixed, stirred at 40°C to yield a transparent stable solution, and then transferred to an oven for heating at 80°C for 20h. The resulting precipitate was cooled down and separated by centrifugation, followed by washing with water and ethanol several times. Then the resulting solid was dried at 60°C overnight, and calcined at 300 or 450°C for 4h with a heating rate of 1°C/min. The as-synthesized mesoporous materials were denoted as meso-NiO-300 and meso-NiO-450 for the 300 and 450°C-calcined samples, respectively. For comparison, two other nanosized NiO samples were also prepared through different routes. One sample, denoted as nano-NiO-sg, was synthesized by a modified sol–gel method [8–10], using citric acid as ligand. Nickel nitrate solution was added drop by drop into a citric acid solution to generate a completely homogeneous and transparent solution. Then the solution was subjected to evaporation slowly at 70°C until a highly viscous residual was formed. After drying at 110°C, a gel precursor was formed, and then calcined at 380°C for 4h. Another nano-scale NiO sample, denoted as nano-NiO-hp, was prepared by homogeneous precipitation in the presence of urea [15]. Urea solution was added into the nickel nitrate solution, and the pH value was adjusted using diluted nitric acid or ammonia solution. The mixed solution was transferred to a flask for heating at 90°C for 10h. The resulting precipitate was cooled down and separated by centrifugation, washed with water, dried at 80°C overnight, and calcined at 400°C for 4h. 2.2 Catalyst characterization The small-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured by X-ray powder diffraction (Model D/Max-C, Regaku), with Cu Kα radiation (λ =0.15406nm) and a scanning rate of 1°/min. The wide-angle XRD patterns were recorded on a Panalytical X’pert PRO power diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. Nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms were recorded at 77K on an automated micromeritics Tri-Star 3000 apparatus. Surface areas were calculated using the multipoint BET equation. Pore size distributions were calculated by the BJH (Barrett, Joyner, and Halender) method using the desorption branch of the isotherm. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a FEI Tecnai-F30 FEG instrument with an acceleration voltage of 300kV. The oxygen desorption properties of various catalysts were studied by O2-TPD measurements on a mass spectrometer. The catalyst sample (0.2g) was pretreated in pure oxygen flowing at 15mL/min at the sample's calcining temperature for 1h and then cooled to room temperature under the oxygen flow. After the system was subsequently flushed with He to achieve a smooth baseline, the sample was heated to 900°C at a rate of 15°C/min in He flow (30mL/min). The reactor exit was monitored on-line by a mass spectrometer. Laser Raman spectroscopy (LRS) was performed using a Renishaw UV–vis Raman 1000 system equipped with a CCD detector and a Leica DMLM microscope. The line at 514.5nm of an Ar+ laser was used for excitation. The surface composition of the catalysts was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XPS was performed using a VG ESCALAB/Auger spectrometer, which was ideally suited to probe the presence of different oxidation states via the chemical shift observed. Spectra were corrected using the C 1s signal located at 284.5eV. 2.3 Catalytic reaction The selective oxidation of propane was carried out in a fixed bed flow reactor under atmospheric pressure. For each testing, 0.1g of catalyst (40–80 mesh particles) was loaded in a quartz tubular reactor (5mm i.d.). The remaining space of the reactor was filled with quartz sand to minimize possible homogeneous reactions. The molar composition of the reactant gas was C3H8:O2:He=1.2:1.0:1.2, and the total flow rate of gaseous reactants was 10,000Lkgcat −1 h−1. The reaction products were analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and FID detector. 3 Results and Discussion 3.1 Catalyst characterization XRD patterns of NiO samples prepared by different methods are shown in Fig. 1 . All the samples show characteristic peaks of cubic NiO (Fm3m) at 2θ =37°, 43° and 63°, which can be perfectly matched to peaks for (111), (200) and (220) crystal planes, respectively (JCPDS Card No. 4-0835) [21]. No peaks due to any impurity are observed, indicating that the crystalline NiO obtained via these synthesis routes consists of an ultrapure phase. From the line broadening of the (200) diffraction peak at 43°, the crystallite sizes of the samples were calculated by Scherrer formula (L =0.89λ/β cos θ). The results are shown in Table 1 . Among the NiO samples studied, meso-NiO-300 shows the smallest crystallite size of only 2.1nm. When the calcination temperature increases to 450°C, the size of meso-NiO is increased to 8.9nm. Generally, the calcination at higher temperature is favorable to the formation of larger crystalline particles. However, the particle size of meso-NiO-450 is comparable to that of nano-NiO-sg calcined at 380°C, and much smaller than the size of nano-NiO-hp calcined at 400°C. This indicates that the surfactant-assisted synthesis used for meso-NiO can decrease the crystallite size of NiO. The inset in Fig. 1 shows the small-angle XRD patterns of meso-NiO calcined at 300 and 450°C. Both the patterns show a peak at low angles, indicating the existence of mesoporous structure. For the 450°C-calcined sample the peak is shifted to lower angle and decreased in intensity, which indicates an enlargement of mesoporous size and a decrease in mesoporous regularity due to calcination at higher temperature. Surface area and pore size distribution analysis were conducted using N2 adsorption, and the results are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. Meso-NiO-300 possesses a narrow mesoporous size distribution at around 4.5nm, a high area of 365.5m2/g and a large pore volume of 0.51cm3/g. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm shows a typical type-IV sorption behavior with a well-defined pore-filling step at 0.45 P/P 0, which clearly indicates the presence of mesopores in the sample. The meso-NiO calcined at a higher temperature (450°C) shows expected decreases in surface area and pore volume, and the pore size distribution becomes more dispersive. However, the mesoporous nature of this sample is still preserved, as evidenced by a hysteresis loop in its N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm. The pore-filling step shifts to a higher relative pressure, which indicates an increase of mesopore size and coincides with the small-angle XRD results. The mesostructure of meso-NiO samples is further confirmed by the TEM images shown in Fig. 3 . The wormhole-like pores of meso-NiO-300 are randomly arranged but distributed homogeneously within the whole NiO nanoparticles. The sizes of pores and of particles increase simultaneously with the calcination temperature increasing from 300 to 450°C, in accordance with the data presented in Table 1. In consequence of XRD, N2 adsorption–desorption and TEM results, the mesoporous structure of meso-NiO can be ascribed to the pores formed between NiO nanoparticles due to their aggregation. Banerjee et al. [14] reported that the oven-dried mesoporous NiO showed a hexagonal morphology that is ordered and periodic with the pores in the nanometer scale. However, this highly ordered structure is not found here, probably due to the calcination used in this work that destroyed the mesoporous regularity. The O2-TPD-ms profiles for nano-NiO-sg and meso-NiO-300 samples are shown in Fig. 4 . The nano-NiO-sg presents a main desorption peak and a very weak peak centered at around 380 and 720°C, respectively, indicating that at least two different types of oxygen exist in this sample. Two peaks are also observed for meso-NiO-300. However, the area of the second peak increases drastically, with a peak temperature shifting slightly to 700°C. Meanwhile, the first peak is greatly weakened and located over a wider range of temperature. The big difference of the O2-TPD profiles suggests that the adsorption sites on the NiO surface responsible to these peaks are strongly affected by the sample structure or its preparation. From the viewpoint of nonstoichiometry, adsorbed oxygen on NiO could be regarded as surface excess oxygen (cationic vacancies), which is the electrophilic oxygen species in nature. It was reported that oxygen desorption from NiO occurring at temperatures below 700°C corresponds to the non-stoichiometric oxygen [22,23]. The peak located at 320–360°C was assigned to O2 −, while the peaks at 420–450°C and >520°C were assigned to O− on different sites [24]. Based on these literature data, the first and the second oxygen desorption peaks on both the NiO samples could be ascribed to O2 − and O− species, respectively. Thus, it is clearly seen from Fig. 4 that the amount of O− species in meso-NiO is much greater than that in nano-NiO, which is further confirmed by the XPS results as described below. XPS measurements were performed to obtain information about the oxidation state and the chemical environment of the elements on the surface of the catalysts. In the O 1s spectra (Fig. 5 , left panel), all the samples present two peaks at binding energies of around 529.8 and 531.7eV. The former peak is due to the oxidic species (O2−), while the latter one could be assigned to O− species [25,26], or to O− and Ni3+ ion defects on the surface [27]. It is interesting to note that the relative intensities of these two peaks are distinctly different for nano- and meso-NiO samples. For the two nano-NiO samples the 531.7eV peak is much smaller than the peak at 529.8eV, indicating less O− species on these samples. However, on both the meso-NiO samples the O− species become predominant, as evidenced by the enhanced feature at 531.7eV which is larger than that at 529.8eV. These findings are consistent with O2-TPD results. In the Ni 2p3/2 XPS spectra (Fig. 5, right panel), all the samples exhibit two resolvable peaks at BEs of around 854 and 856eV, with a shakeup satellite at ∼862eV. The feature at about 854eV can be attributed to Ni2+, while the feature at ∼856eV has been conventionally assigned to the Ni3+ species on the NiO surface [25,28]. It was assumed that non-stoichiometric nickel oxide contains many Ni2+ vacancies, and to keep the charge near the Ni2+ vacancies neutral, some of the Ni2+ ions were oxidized to Ni3+ [19]. Recently, the origin of this high BE peak was also related to surface effects [29]. As shown in Fig. 5, the relative intensity of the peak at ∼856eV (I 856) with respect to that of the peak at ∼854eV (I 854) is different for the two nano-NiO samples. The sample prepared by sol–gel method shows a higher I 856/I 854 ratio than the sample prepared by homogenous precipitation. This phenomenon could be related to their different particle sizes as shown in Table 1. A smaller particle size leads to a higher surface-to-volume ratio and, as a result, to an increase in intensity of the feature at ∼856eV due to surface effect [29]. Such a situation is also observed for mesoporous NiO samples with different crystallite sizes calcined at 300 and 450°C. However, both the mesoporous NiO catalysts present a much higher I 856/I 854 ratio compared to nano-NiO samples, despite the fact that meso-NiO-450 has a larger crystallite size and a lower surface area than those of nano-NiO-sg. This observation could be related to different densities of their Ni3+ defects. It is thus shown that the density of Ni3+ is higher for meso-NiO than for nano-NiO samples. Raman spectra of the different NiO samples collected at room temperature are presented in Fig. 6 . All the samples exhibit a strong band at about 500cm−1 due to Ni–O stretching mode [30,31]. Except nano-NiO-hp, a shoulder band at around 375cm−1 is also observed for the samples. The relative intensity of this shoulder of meso-NiO-300 is higher than that of meso-NiO-450, while that of nano-NiO sample is the least. The shoulder at ∼375cm−1 is indicative of the high nickel vacancy concentration [13,22] and the non-stoichiometry of the samples [31,32]. Therefore, it follows that the nickel vacancy concentration in meso-NiO-300 is the highest, followed by meso-NiO-450 and the nano-NiO samples. Since such cation vacancies are known to induce adjacent Ni3+ and O− species, these findings coincide with O2-TPD and XPS results of the samples. 3.2 Catalytic performance The remarkable differences in catalytic performance among the NiO samples can be seen from Table 2 . The nano-NiO sample prepared by sol–gel method is more active for the ODHP reaction than the sample prepared by homogeneous precipitation. At an appreciable conversion of propane, however, both the samples show propene selectivities at a low level. The propene selectivity is sharply decreased with the temperature increasing above 350°C, indicating transformation of the catalysts caused by high temperature. When the temperature increases to 400°C, the reaction products are mainly CO x on nano-NiO-hp and CH4 plus CO x on nano-NiO-sg, respectively, whereas no propene is formed. At any temperatures examined, not more than 7% of propene yield could be obtained for these two nano-NiO samples. Compared with nano-NiO catalysts, a distinct catalytic behavior is observed for meso-NiO samples. Although less active at low temperature, these samples are more selective for propene formation at high propane conversions. Thus, propene yield is largely enhanced. Meso-NiO-300 shows the best catalytic performance for the ODHP reaction. The maximal propene yield of 13.2% is achieved at a propane conversion of 25.8% at 450°C. For the meso-NiO-450 catalyst, the onset of the catalytic reaction shifts to higher temperature. Above 400°C, however, the sample shows catalytic performance similar to that of the meso-NiO-300. A propene yield of 12.1% is attained at 475°C with this 450°C-calcined mesoporous NiO catalyst. As shown in Table 2, another superior catalytic behavior of meso-NiO is also striking. Compared with nano-NiO, meso-NiO shows a wider temperature range for the ODHP reaction. The big drop in propene selectivity is observed at above 350°C with nano-NiO samples, whereas the use of meso-NiO samples allows the upper temperature limit to be raised to temperature higher than 500°C. For meso-NiO-300, the propene selectivity keeps around 50% in the temperature range from 400 to 550°C. When the temperature reaches as high as 600°C, the propene selectivity of 31.2% can be still obtained. The stability of a catalyst is very important in terms of potential industrial applications. So the stability of the mesoporous catalyst, meso-NiO-300, was investigated by recording the catalytic performance for 72h on-line at settled reaction conditions (T =450°C). The result of the stability test is presented in Fig. 7 . It can be seen that both propane conversion and propene yield maintain their initial values during a long running time (72h), indicating the high stability of the mesoporous NiO catalyst. In order to confirm the Ni species after the reaction, we measured Raman spectra after the ODHP reaction at 400 and 450°C for nano- and meso-NiO samples, respectively. The results are shown in Fig. 8 (A). After the reaction, all the catalysts present two strong bands at 1500 and 1600cm−1, assigned to carbon deposition produced. The oxide structure of meso-NiO samples remains essentially unchanged, as evidenced by the 500-cm−1 band due to Ni–O stretching that can be still clearly observed. However, that band on nano-NiO samples disappears completely after reaction, indicating that the Ni–O bonds were reduced to metallic nickel. This is further confirmed by XRD results of the used catalysts, as shown in Fig. 8(B). After 450°C reaction, the two mesoporous NiO still present XRD patterns characteristic of NiO, although the peaks become sharper and stronger as compared to those of fresh catalysts, indicating a higher degree of crystallization and/or crystallite growth. On the other hand, after 400°C reaction with nano-NiO catalysts, new peaks ascribed to metallic Ni are observed at 44.5°, 51.8° and 76.2°, which are indexable as Ni (111), Ni (200) and Ni (220), respectively [21]. These observations indicate that at higher temperature (400°C), these NiO samples without mesoporous structure are reduced to metallic Ni by the feed C3H8 and produced H2, and the cracking as well as the deep oxidation of propene then proceeded on these catalysts. 3.3 Discussion In this work the mesoporous nickel oxide, prepared using surfactant as a template and urea as a hydrolysis-controlling agent, has been investigated for the ODHP to propene. The mesostructured NiO proves to be an active and selective catalytic material for conversion of propane to propene, offering an overall propene yield of 13.2% at 450°C. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest propene yield reported so far for pure NiO catalysts in the literature. Such a propene yield is even higher than those reported for Ni–Ce–O [11] and nanosized Ti–Ni–O and Zr–Ni–O [8,9] catalysts. Compared with two other nano-NiO samples prepared by homogeneous precipitation and sol–gel process, respectively, the meso-NiO catalysts show higher selectivities to propene at high propane conversion levels and, consequently, much higher propene yields. Based on catalyst characterization results, these great differences in catalytic behavior of the catalysts could be attributed to several important factors. One factor to be considered is the structure effect. As shown in Table 1, all the nickel oxide catalysts present quite different crystallite sizes and surface areas, depending on preparation manner and calcining temperature. Generally, nanocatalytic materials with a high surface area should generate better catalytic performance, due to their numerous edges and corners which are conventionally considered as active sites for adsorption of reactants. Meso-NiO-450 and nano-NiO-hp are less active than meso-NiO-300 and nano-NiO-300, respectively, according to their sequence of surface area. However, both the mesostructured catalysts show the similar and unique catalytic behavior, i.e., large temperature range of the ODHP reaction and high selectivity to propene, despite the fact that their crystal sizes or surface areas are greatly different. Furthermore, the surface area of meso-NiO-450 is lower than that of nano-NiO-sg, but the former catalyst exhibits a superior catalytic performance in terms of much higher propene selectivity at high propane conversion levels. These results confirm that the crystallite size and the surface area cannot completely account for the observed differences in catalytic activity and selectivity; a high porosity of the mesostructured NiO must also be taken into account. The mesoporous structure assembled by nanocrystallites can allow efficient molecular transport by diffusion in the channels during the ODHP reaction, thus suppressing the consecutive oxidation of propene to CO and CO2 and increasing the selective conversion of propane to propene. Other important factors are probably relevant to the oxygen species and defects on the catalyst surface. These surface properties of nickel oxide have already been proven to be affected strongly by the sample quality or its preparation [24], and have been discussed for the ODHE reaction [20,31,32]. However, very limited studies on these properties were made for NiO nanocrystals of various shapes, especially for those with mesoporous structure. In our present study, O2-TPD, XPS and Raman characterizations demonstrate that the meso-NiO samples present much higher density of O− species and Ni3+ defects than the other two nanostructured NiO samples. The presence of Ni3+ defects has been related to the good catalytic properties of NiO catalyst [29]. The O− and O2 −, which have been suggested as the main species formed on the nickel oxide [24], are predominant on meso- and nano-NiO, respectively, as evidenced by O2-TPD results. This observation is significant, since the nature and reactivity of the oxygen species on the catalytic surface are believed to be important factors determining the performance of metal oxide catalysts in selective oxidation reactions. Based on experiments with NiO catalysts, Martin and co-workers [33] suggested that the electrophilic species (possibly O−) are active species for the ODHE reaction, whereas the role of lattice O2− or gas-phase O2 can be excluded. This proposition was further confirmed by Chen et al. [23,34], using O2-TPD, pulse reaction, in situ Wess magnetic measurement and TAP techniques. It was found that the β oxygen species (possibly O−) shows higher selectivity to ethylene than the α one (possibly O2 −, O2 2−) in the ODHE reaction over NiO catalysts. Here, a similar situation may exist in the ODHP reaction. Actually, since O− is more stable than O2 − [24], the former is expected to be more selective for the ODHP to propene. This deduction is consistent with the catalytic data shown in Table 2, where meso-NiO is less active at low temperature but much more selective for the ODHP reaction than nano-NiO. 4 Conclusions The results of this study demonstrate that mesoporous nickel oxide, prepared by using SDS as a template and urea as a hydrolysis-controlling agent, is an active and selective catalytic material for the ODHP to propene. Compared with nano-NiO samples prepared by homogeneous precipitation and sol–gel method, the meso-NiO shows a higher selectivity to propene at a high propane conversion level, and its upper temperature limit is raised to a much higher temperature. An optimum propene yield of 13.2% with 25.8% propane conversion and 51.3% propene selectivity is achieved at 450°C with the meso-NiO sample calcined at 300°C. Both the propane conversion and the propene selectivity maintain their initial values during 72h running, indicating the high stability of the mesoporous NiO catalyst. The fine catalytic behavior of meso-NiO samples could be attributed to structure effects and surface properties, such as oxygen species and defects on the catalyst surface. The mesoporous structure assembled by nanocrystallites can allow efficient molecular transport by diffusion in the channels during the ODHP reaction and thus can increase the selectivity of propene by suppressing the consecutive oxidation of propene to CO and CO2. O2-TPD, XPS and Raman characterizations demonstrate that the meso-NiO samples present much higher density of O− species, which are suggested to be the active and selective species for the ODH reaction.

        "dc:description": "Mesoporous NiO catalysts prepared by a surfactant-assisted route have been investigated in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propene; these catalysts are compared with two other NiO samples prepared by homogeneous precipitation and sol–gel method, respectively. Mesoporous NiO is proven to be an active and selective catalytic material with an optimum propene yield of 13.2% by the 25.8% propane conversion at 450°C. The propene selectivity remains around 50% in the temperature range from 400 to 550°C. XRD, N2 adsorption, TEM, O2-TPD, XPS and Raman characterizations have been used to study the intrinsic differences among these NiO catalysts. The results demonstrate that the densities of O− species and cation vacancies are much higher for the meso-NiO than for other samples; this difference is related to their different catalytic performances. Besides this, the efficient molecular transport by diffusion in the mesoporous channels also plays an important role during the ODHP reaction.",
