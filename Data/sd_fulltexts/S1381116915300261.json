Graphical abstract Keywords Sulfonated graphene oxide Bifunctional catalyst, Acetone One-step synthesis Methyl isobutyl ketone 1 Introduction As an important organic solvent, methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) has been widely used in many areas, such as paint, resins, coating, and so on. With the rapid development of automobile industry and top-grade coating materials, the demand on MIBK has been continuously increasing [1]. Traditionally, MIBK is mainly synthesized via a three-step process (Scheme 1 ), including acid or base-catalyzed acetone condensation to diacetone alcohol (DA), acid-catalyzed dehydration of DA to mesityl oxide (MO), and metal-catalyzed hydrogenation of MO to MIBK [2]. Compared with such three-step process, one-pot synthesis of MIBK, which can avoid separation of the intermediate DA and MO, has gained great attention in recent years. Integration of acid and hydrogenation active sites in one catalyst is the key point for the facile one-pot synthesis approach. The ideal bifunctional catalyst should simultaneously possess suitable acid strength and catalytic hydrogenation center. Pd [3–7], Ni [8,9] and Cu [10] have been intensively studied as hydrogenation component. As for supported Pd catalyst, the solid acid support mainly includes metal oxides and zeolite, such as ZSM-5 [11,12], ALPO and SAPO [13], Al2O3–MgO(Nb2O5, SiO2) [14,15], Nb2O5–SiO2 [16], ZnO–Cr2O3 [5,6], hydroxide [4], and resins [17]. It has been demonstrated that acetone conversion and MIBK selectivity are significantly depending on the acid strength and density in the catalyst [15]. Kozhevnikova et al. adjusted the Lewis and Brønsted acid density in ZnO–Cr2O3 oxides support by changing Zn/Cr atomic ratio, consequently resulting in different MIBK selectivity. The highest MIBK selectivity of 78.4% and acetone conversion of 38.3% was obtained at Zn/Cr ratio of 1:1 [5,6]. Guan et al. applied Al2O3–SiO2 oxides as support and found that high SiO2 content can increase the Brønsted acid, thus improving the selectivity of MIBK. While the decrease of total acid content led to a low acetone conversion [15]. To overcome the mass transfer limitation, Liu effectively reduced the acidity of HZSM-5 by depositing SiO2–ZrO2 on the surface of HZSM-5, resulting in acetone conversion of 33.4% and MIBK selectivity of 88.1% [3]. Graphene oxide (GO) possesses large surface area and abundant oxygen-containing groups [18]. The previous research has showed that GO could be easily immobilized onto the surface of cordierite monolith, which is an effective approach to avoid the separation issue when used in heterogeneous reactions [19,20]. In addition, the surface acid strength and density of GO can be enhanced by introducing SO3H group via covalent interaction, which has exhibited superior property in ester-exchange reaction [21], esterification of acetic acid with cyclohexanol and hydration of propylene oxide [22]. Inspired by the above research, we rationally construct sulfonated GO (SGO)/cordierite supported Pd bifunctional catalyst for one-pot synthesis of MIBK from acetone. In the present work, SGO was synthesized by using diazonium salt to modify GO and further immobilized onto the surface of cordierite (denoted as SGO/Cor). The as-prepared SGO/Cor was used as solid acid catalyst for the first two steps reaction in acetone condensation and dehydration. To avoid the possible loss of acid sites in other treatment steps, we mixed SGO/Cor with a cordierite based Pd catalyst (denoted as Pd/Cor) directly as the bifunctional catalyst. The catalytic performance of the as-synthesized bifunctional catalyst (denoted as SGO-Pd/Cor) for one-pot synthesis of MIBK was tested in atmospheric gas-phase reaction of acetone. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Commercial cordierite powder (2MgO·2Al2O3·5SiO2) with size 40–60mesh supplied by Jiangxi Xingfeng Chemical Company of China, was used as support after boiling in 30% HNO3 for 2h and washing by deionized water to neutral. The specific BET surface area of cordierite was determined to be 124m2/g. Other regents were used as obtained without any further treatment. 2.2 Synthesis process The modified Hummers method was used to prepare GO. SGO preparation steps were as following: 0.5g sulfanilic acid was added to 5mL 2% NaOH solution. After 30min sonication treatment, 2.0g NaNO2, 30mL ice water and concentrated HCl were added and kept stirring below 5°C. When the white precipitate appeared, the mixture was stirred for another 15min to obtain the diazonium salt of sulfanilic acid. The above diazonium salt of sulfanilic acid of 4.8mL was added dropwise into 50mL GO (2.0mg/mL) suspension with vigorous stirring in ice-bath for 3h to obtain SGO solution. The cordierite powder was then added under stirring for another 0.5h, followed by filtration, drying to obtain the immobilized SGO on cordierite. The resulting sample was denoted as SGO/Cor. The cordierite powder was immersed into 50mL H2PdCl4 (0.01mol/L) solution and sonicated for 20min. After 110°C drying and calcination at 350°C for 3h, it was further reduced by KBH4 for 0.5h. The Pd loading was 0.195mg/g, and the obtained catalyst was denoted as Pd/Cor. For comparison, chemically mixed bifunctional catalyst, denoted as Pd/SGO/Cor, was prepared by impregnating SGO/Cor powder in H2PdCl4 aqueous solution with stirring, followed by drying and KBH4 reduction for 0.5h. 2.3 Characterizations The FT-IR spectra of GO, SGO (n(HCl): n (Sulfanilic acid)=12:1) and SGO/Cor were tested on Nicolet 6700 Fourier transform spectrometer (Nicolet Magana Co.), by the KBr tablet method and with a 4cm−1 scanning resolution for 32s. The scanning range was from 400 to 4000cm−1 and the background peak was removed before the test. The XPS spectrum of SGO (n(HCl): n (Sulfanilic acid)=12:1) and SGO/Cor were performed on ESCALAB 250Xi type (Thermal Fisher Scientific) X-ray photoelectron spectrometer, C1s binding energy (284.6eV) was used as a benchmark. The TG analysis of GO and SGO (n(HCl): n (Sulfanilic acid)=12:1) were measured on TA Instruments STA449C thermal gravimetric analysis, under air atmosphere with the heating rate of 10°C /min. XRD was carried out on a Japan Rigaku D/MAX2500 instrument with Cu Kα radiation and a scanning rate of 5°/min. The size of Pd particles for Pd/Cor was tested by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on a JEOL JEM-2100(Japan) at 200kV. 2.4 Catalytic test The catalytic reactions were carried out in a fixed-bed micro-reactor (8mm i.d.) at ambient pressure using physical mixed catalyst 1.5g SGO/Cor and 1.5g Pd/Cor, denoted as SGO-Pd/Cor. Acetone was supplied by bubbling a flow of H2 (15mL/min) through a stainless steel saturator containing acetone, which was kept at 0°C. The flow of acetone and H2 was diluted by a flow of N2 (120mL/min), and then introduced into the reactor. The space velocity is kept at 2100h−1, the mole ratio of H2/acetone is determined as 10:1, and the experiment was carried out at 200°C for 2h, the products were collected in a cold trap (held in an ethanol–dry ice bath) and analyzed by Shimazu GC-2010 equipped with a flame ionization detector. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterizations of GO and SGO Fig. 1 shows the FT-IR spectra of GO and SGO. The peak at 3393cm−1 for GO corresponds to OH bond stretching vibration, implying the presence of hydroxyl groups from absorbed water. The peaks at 1736cm−1, 1626cm−1, 1221cm−1, 1046cm−1 for GO could be assigned to the oxygen-containing groups CO, CC, COC, and COH, respectively. In contrast, two additional peaks at 1383cm−1 and 1114cm−1 are observed in SGO, which are probably associated with SO and SO bonds, indicating the successfully grafting of SO3H group onto GO. Furthermore, the peak intensities of oxygen-containing groups in SGO are significantly decreased, suggesting the reduction of GO during sulfonation process. XPS measurement was conducted to examine the chemical state of sulfur element. Fig. 2 presents the XPS spectra of survey scan and high resolution S 2p and C 1s for SGO. Fig. 2(a) shows C 1s, O 1s, and S 2p elemental signals, confirming the presence of sulfur element in SGO. The concentration of SO3H groups on SGO was evaluated to be about 1.01mmol/g by atom percentage calculation. The C 1s spectrum (Fig. 2(b)) could be fitted to four peaks located at 284.5, 285.6, 286.2, and 286.9eV, corresponding to CC, COH, CN and COC, respectively. The C–N group was from sulfanilic acid during reaction. Fig. 2(c) shows a S 2p peak for SGO at 168.1eV associated with SO bond, which is close to that value of sulfonated graphene (168.3eV) [21]. The lower binding energy probably caused by the electron transfer from graphene to the SO3H group, which might result in a decrease in acid strength for the SO3H groups on SGO [23]. Fig. 3 shows the TG curves of GO and SGO. GO exhibits three weight losses at 97.8°C, 216.2°C, and 385.7°C, which are assigned to the loss of water and decomposition of oxygen-containing groups. In contrast, SGO shows an additional weight loss at 517.9°C from the decomposition of SO3H group. These results indicate that SO3H groups on SGO are rather thermal stable. This is important for the reactions at high temperature. 3.2 Characterizations of SGO/Cor and deactivated SGO/Cor To identify the present of SGO on cordierite, the XPS spectra of SGO/Cor and deactivated SGO/Cor are shown in Fig. 4 . From the survey scan and high resolution S2p spectrum in Fig. 4(a) and (b), it is confirmed that SGO has been successfully immobilized on the surface of cordierite. Due to the signal disturb from cordierite, the S2p intensity is decreased compared to SGO. We further compare the atomic ratio of sulfur to carbon for fresh and deactivated SGO/Cor, and find out that the sulfur content does not change much (5.6:100 and 4.5:100, respectively). If we compare the C1s spectrum in Fig. 4(c) and (d), more COH and CO group appear on the surface of deactivated SGO/Cor. Meanwhile, during experiments we can observe that the color of SGO/Cor changed from brown to black after deactivation. Fig. 5 shows the FT-IR spectra of SGO/Cor and deactivated SGO/Cor. There is no big difference between the two curves, except for the peaks at 1384cm−1 associated with SO bonds. It is clear that the peak intensity of SO bonds of fresh SGO/Cor is higher than that of deactivated SGO/Cor. Considering the S2p and C1s XPS spectra in Fig. 4(b)–(d), it could be concluded that the intensity reduce of SO is caused by the carbon deposition. The SO3H groups are covered by the carbon deposition, resulting in the activity decrease for the as-prepared bifunctional catalyst. So deactivation of the catalyst is mainly caused by the carbon deposition, instead of SGO decomposition. 3.3 Characterizations of Pd/Cor catalyst The XRD pattern of Pd/Cor catalyst in Fig. 6 shows that indialite (hexagonal α-cordierite) is the major phase of cordierite, while traces of spinel phase also present. In addition, the diffraction peaks of palladium can be clearly observed at 40.1° (111), 46.6 (200), 68.1 (220), while no palladium oxide was observed. To compare the effect of Pd particle size on the performance of the bifunctional catalyst, we prepared the Pd/Cor catalyst with larger size by calcination at 350°C for 3h in hydrogen atmosphere. The TEM images of Pd/Cor catalyst are shown in Fig. 7 . It is observed that the Pd particles loaded on cordierite are distributed with size about 5–10nm. After calcinations, the Pd particle size is increased to 40–60nm as shown in Fig. 7. 3.4 Catalytic tests The amount of concentrated HCl is closely related to the amount of SO3H groups onto GO in the sulfonation step by diazonium salt. In diazotization reaction, sulfanilic acid is firstly dissolved by the concentrated HCl, then reacts with NaNO2 to generate HNO2, and finally produces stable diazonium salt. If the amount of concentrated HCl is insufficient, diazonium salt easily decomposes. Therefore sufficient concentrated HCl is an assurance for sulfonation reaction. Fig. 8 shows the effect of the amount of HCl on the catalytic performance of SGO-Pd/Cor. It is observed that the acetone conversion is increased with the HCl amount increase. When the mole ratio of HCl to sulfanilic acid was 12:1, the highest acetone conversion of 65% was obtained. Compared with GO/Cor, SGO provides stronger acid sites, indicating that the acetone conversion is mainly catalyzed by stronger acid sites than the oxygen-containing groups on GO. However, the MIBK selectivity changes little at 80–90% with the amount of concentrated HCl. As for the product distribution, no intermediate product MO and DA are detected and the by-products are mainly isopropanol (IPA) and diisobutyl ketone (DIBK). This can be explained that SO3H group belongs to strong Brønsted acid sites, which has been revealed in the literature [24]. In addition, many previous researches revealed that the presence of Brønsted acid sites plays an important role for MIBK synthesis.[3,5,6,15] To further identify the function of SO3H group as solid acid catalyst, cordierite or GO as acid sites are investigated, and acetone conversion is even lower than 3%. This indicates that SO3H group, instead of the oxygen-containing groups and cordierite, acts as the active solid acid site for such reaction. Fig. 9 shows the effect of reaction temperature on the catalytic performance of SGO-Pd/Cor. It is clear that acetone conversion increases at temperature below 200°C with a relative stable MIBK selectivity. When the temperature is over 200°C, both acetone conversion and MIBK selectivity decrease dramatically. That is probably attributed to the carbon deposition caused by the relatively high reaction temperature, which gradually covers the acid sites. The fresh bifunctional catalyst SGO-Pd/Cor exhibits 86% MIBK selectivity at 65% acetone conversion in atmospheric gas-phase reaction, which is higher than that of ever reported so far. The SO3H group supplies strong Brønsted acid sites, which is necessary for the high acetone conversion and high selectivity to MIBK. In addition, in the present work all SO3H group is distributed on the surface of SGO nanosheets, which are further immobilized on the surface of cordierite. Therefore, the mass transfer limitation in the consecutive reactions from acetone to MIBK is efficiently eliminated. Fig. 10 shows the stability of SGO-Pd/Cor catalyst. It is noteworthy that the acetone conversion decreases with the time-on-stream. The accumulation of carbon deposition during catalytic reaction is the main reason for the catalyst deactivation. So the stability of such catalyst is still a challenge to be solved in the future work. In addition, we investigated the effect of Pd particle size and chemical state on the performance of the bifunctional catalyst SGO-Pd/Cor. When the Pd/Cor with larger Pd size is used, an acetone conversion 25.6% and MIBK selectivity 47.4% were obtained. When Pd/Cor is exposed to air at 120°C, Pd is changed to PdO and an acetone conversion of 33.4% and MIBK selectivity of 84.8% were achieved. To further explore the possibility of a Pd/SGO/Cor catalyst, we loaded Pd nanoparticles on SGO/Cor by impregnation approach and a rather low acetone conversion of 9.0% and MIBK selectivity of 41.7% were obtained. This result is much lower than that of the physically mixed catalyst, indicating the loss of acid sites in the steps of Pd loading because of the possible interaction between SO3H groups and Pd nanoparticles. 4 Conclusions In summary, SGO was synthesized by using diazonium salt to modify GO nanosheets and further immobilized on the surface of cordierite. FT-IR, XPS, TG results indicated that SO3H groups had been successfully introduced onto GO nanosheets. By physically mixing with cordierite based Pd catalyst, the bifunctional catalyst SGO-Pd/Cor exhibited a superior performance in one-pot synthesis of MIBK from acetone. An acetone conversion of 65% and MIBK selectivity of 86% was obtained in atmospheric gas-phase reaction at the condition of 200°C, space velocity 2100h−1, and the mole ratio of hydrogen and actone 10:1, showing the best result in related literature reports to date. XPS and FT-IR analysis show that carbon deposition is the main reason for catalyst deactivation. Considering the monolith feature of cordierite as support, as well as facile preparation of physical mixed catalyst, SGO-Pd/Cor is a promising catalyst for facile and effective one-pot synthesis of MIBK from acetone.
