Graphical abstract Clusters shift the d-band center energy of the symbiotic single-atoms decorated on a 2D C-N nanosheet, modifying the rate-determining step of ORR to enhance the performance of the designed catalyst. Two-dimensional (2D) materials loaded with single atoms and clusters are being set at the forefront of catalysis due to their distinctive geometric and electronic features. However, the usually-complicated synthesis procedures impede in-depth clarification of their catalytic mechanisms. To this end, herein we developed an efficient one-step dimension-reduction carbonization strategy, with which we successfully architected a highly-efficient catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), featured with symbiotic cobalt single atoms and clusters decorated in two-dimensional (2D) ultra-thin (3.5 nm thickness) nitrogen-carbon nanosheets. The synergistic effects of the two components afford excellent oxygen reduction activity in alkaline media (E 1/2 = 0.823 V vs. RHE) and thereof a high power density (146.61 mW cm−2) in an assembled Zn-air battery. As revealed by theoretical calculations, the cobalt clusters can regulate electrons surrounding those individual atoms and affect the adsorption of intermediate species. As a consequence, the derived active sites of single cobalt atoms lead to a significant improvement of the ORR performance. Thus, our work may fuel interests to delicate architecture of single atoms and clusters coexisting 2D support toward optimal electrocatalytic performance. Keywords Single atoms and clusters Two-dimensional Nanosheets Carbon-Nitrogen Oxygen reduction reaction 1 Introduction Single atom and ultra-small cluster catalysts have fueled interests in the field of oxygen electrocatalysis due to their high surface-atom ratio, distinctive electronic structure and their strong interaction [1–5]. Ultra-small clusters induce electronic rearrangements in the single atom active sites to optimize the adsorption of intermediate species, thereby increasing the catalytic activity [6–9]. However, single atoms are extremely prone to coalescence into clusters or nanoparticles, leading to a challenge to produce catalysts abundant with high density and uniform distribution of single atoms and clusters. To this end, great efforts have been made for the controlled synthesis to reverse such situation [10]. Nevertheless, most of the synthesis methods are involved with more complicated reaction steps and even post-processing of materials. In addition to the synergistic interaction between single atoms and clusters, catalyst morphology also directly affects the catalytic properties [11–14]. In terms of oxygen electrocatalysis, various metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) derived nitrogen-carbon catalysts were synthesized with featured morphologies [15–17], cataloged into one-dimensional (1D) [18], two-dimensional (2D) [19,20] and three-dimensional (3D) catalysts [21–24]. Among them, 2D catalysts have attracted much attention owing to their incomparable advantages. Unfortunately, conventional two-dimensional materials often require a series of complex processes. Therefore, it is imperative to find a simple and efficient synthesis strategy to prepare 2D oxygen electrocatalysts with synergistic effects of single atoms and clusters. As a consequence, it enables affording abundant active sites, efficient ion transport channels, fast electron transport rates and excellent structural stability for electrocatalytic reactions. Herein, we applied a one-step molten salt (MS) assisted carbonation strategy to “strip and etch” 3D Co-ZIF into 2D nitrogen-carbon catalysts (Co-MS-NC) by treating mixed molten salts (LiCl/KCl) as stripping and etching agents. Co-MS-NC catalysts appear as extremely thin (3.5 nm) nanosheet structures. Importantly, in contrast with the direct carbonization, one-step molten salt-assisted carbonation strategy can effectively introduce some clusters in the targeted catalysts and form unique ultra-thin 2D structures. Owing to its ultra-thin 2D morphology and the heterogeneous structure of single atoms and clusters, the exceptional performance was afforded in terms of the ORR and Zn-air battery (ZAB). Concurrently, we elucidated the catalytic mechanism by using density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Notably, the introduction of clusters can increase the d-band center energy of single atom active sites, thereby enhancing the adsorption of *OOH and weakening the adsorption of *O and *OH during the ORR reaction, changing the rate-determining step (RDS). Obviously, our work provides a new synthesis strategy 2D catalysts and gains unique insight into N-C substrate-loaded synergistic single atoms and clusters. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Synthesis and characterization of catalysts In a molten salt method, a salt with a low melting point is used as the reaction medium, and the reactants and the salt are mixed uniformly and then heated to yield the product. As a consequence, it has many advantages over other pyrolysis methods, such as reducing the reaction temperature, controlling the shape and size of the product, and increasing the purity of the product. Herein, we used a mixed molten salt pyrolysis method to prepare the catalysts, which has a lower eutectic point than the single molten salt method, which allows for rapid melting and penetration of the precursor at lower temperatures by capillary action. Thus, it facilitates the formation of carbon nanosheets. However, the mixed salts with high eutectic points act as rigid templates during pyrolysis [25–27]. Therefore, it is feasible to modulate the eutectic point of mixed molten salts by selecting various or different mass ratios salts, to perform distinct functionalities during pyrolysis [28,29]. The mixed molten salts used here were LiCl and KCl in a mass ratio of 1:1, with a eutectic point of ∼400 ℃. This temperature is substantially lower than LiCl (605 ℃) and KCl (770 ℃), reducing the reaction temperature significantly [26,30]. This can facilitate the “stripping and etching” of the external organic ligands of Co-ZIF at lower temperature. In addition, both LiCl and KCl have high decomposition temperatures (much higher than the pyrolysis temperature), which prevents the mixed molten salts from decomposition before reaching the carbonation temperature. As the temperature increases, the external organic ligands dissolve in the highly polar mixed molten salt solution. So, it can induce the conversion of 3D Co-ZIF to 2D Co-doped carbon nanosheets and introduce metal clusters during pyrolysis (Fig. 1 a). To investigate the effect of the molten salt pyrolysis method on catalyst, a series of characterizations were carried out. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of Co-MS-NC (Fig. S1) shows significantly different morphology compared to Co-NC (Figs S2 and S3). Notably, Co-MS-NC has a fully curled structure. This is due to the fact that the mixed molten salts (LiCl and KCl) create a mild and confined environment for polymerization and carbonation of the ligand derivatives. As a result, the stripping and etching effect occurs for the precursors, and it induces the formation of 2D nanosheets from the precursors during the carbonization process. Such occurrence is even enhanced as the ratio of molten salts increases (Fig. S4). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of Co-MS-NC-(1:5), compared with Co-NC (Fig. S5), reveals an ultra-thin nanosheet structures (Fig. 1b), which is formed due to the exfoliation etching effect by mixed molten salts pyrolysis. Moreover, it can be illustrated by using TEM (Fig. S6) that the one-step carbonation strategy enables successfully preparing very homogeneous 2D nanosheets. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measured the thickness 3.5 nm of Co-MS-NC-(1:5), which was uniformly distributed (Fig. 1c). Fig. 1d shows an aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image of Co-MS-NC-(1:5). It can be seen that both Co single atoms (orange circles) and a slightly larger Co clusters (green circles) are homogeneously distributed. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping revealed a uniform distribution of Co, N, O and C elements (Fig. 1e–i). Furthermore, no obvious lattice fringes were observed in high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) images (Fig. 1j), suggesting that Co-MS-NC-(1:5) exhibits a randomly oriented graphitic domain as well as an abundance of defects within the carbon structure. Such structure positively impacts the active sites’ loading and increases the specific surface area. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) images (inset of Fig. 1j) show a diffuse spot which also indicates that Co-MS-NC-(1:5) has a disordered amorphous structure, which is consistent with HR-TEM analyses. The inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) confirmed that the content of cobalt species was 1.029 wt% (Table S1). In short, we have successfully designed a one-step dimensional reduction carbonization strategy, which can “strip and etch” 3D materials into 2D and thereof successfully prepare symbiotic single atoms and clusters co-loaded catalysts. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) (Fig. S7) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Figs S8 and S9) demonstrated that cobalt acetylacetonate was successfully introduced into the nitrogen-carbon substrate (ZIF-8). Co loaded on the nitrogen-carbon substrate appears as single atoms or clusters after the carbonization. Subsequently, pore structure of the catalyst was analyzed by using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET). The isothermal N2 adsorption–desorption curves of Co-MS-NC-(1:5) exhibit type IV isotherms with a more pronounced mesoporous feature (Fig. 2 a). Co-MS-NC-(1:5) boasts a specific surface area of 877.69 m2/g, surpassing that of Co-NC (522.29 m2/g). Co-MS-NC-(1:5) displays a distinct hierarchical porous structure ranging from microporous to mesoporous features (Fig. 2b). Microporous morphology can provide many active sites and mesoporous ones can facilitate mass transfer [27]. Additionally, the number of pores in Co-MS-NC-(1:5) has increased, due to the fact that the process of “stripping and etching” the nitrogen-carbon substrate contributes to improve the anchoring of Co. Raman spectrum (Fig. 2c) shows that Co-MS-NC-(1:5/10/20) exhibits higher ID /IG values (1.37/1.08/1.01) than Co-NC (0.98), implying a higher degree of defects. Notably, Co-MS-NC-(1:5) records the highest ID /IG value (1.37). BET and Raman analyses indicate that mixed molten salt pyrolysis can raise the catalysts’ specific surface area, create a micro/mesoporous structure, provide more available active sites, and a higher degree of defects for electron transfer. To determine the surface chemistry and elemental valence states of the catalysts, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were conducted. In the Co 2p spectrum (Fig. S10), the Co3+ content in Co-MS-NC-(1:5) increased significantly compared to Co-NC, and the presence of Co3+ will largely enhance the ORR activity of the catalyst [31,32]. In the C 1s spectrum, compared with Co-NC, Co-MS-NC-(1:5) showed an O=C–O peak at 289.3 eV (Fig. S11). The presence of O=C–O creates more positive charges around the C atoms and enhances the adsorption of oxygen by the surrounding C atoms, thus enhance the catalytic activity. In the N 1s spectrum (Fig. S12), obviously, Pyridine-N and Metal-N (Co-Nx) contents increased in the Co-MS-NC-(1:5) catalysts (Table S2). This is due to that the mixed molten salts pyrolysis promotes the formation of Pyridine-N. Then the Pyridine-N and metal atoms form a Co-Nx catalytic site with a coordination structure that promotes the transfer of electrons to Co, resulting in largely improved ORR catalytic performance. Fig. 2d shows a second-order carbon K-emission spectrum, C K(2), of Co-NC and Co-MS-NC-(1:5/10/20) by soft X-ray emission spectrometer (SXES) [33–36]. The C K(2) spectrum of Co-MS-NC-(1:5/10/20) shifted towards lower energy side compared to Co-NC, implying that the Co-MS-NC catalysts produced through molten salt pyrolysis have higher graphitic degrees, consistent with the Raman result. X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) were used to analyze the fine electronic structure such as element valence and coordination structure [37,38]. In the Co K-edge, the small pre-edge peaks at ∼7706–7711 eV can be related to the 1s-3d dipole transition, which is caused by the hybridization of the Co 4p state with the adjacent Co atom’s 3d state. The main edge at ∼7722–7736 eV is attributed to 1s-4p dipole transition [39–42]. As shown in Fig. 2e, it demonstrates that Co-MS-NC has a higher valence state compared to Co-NC, with the average Co oxidation state of both ranging between +2 and +3, consistent with the increased Co3+ content in XPS. EXAFS and fitting curve display the local atomic environment and geometric configuration of Co sites. For Co-NC (Fig. 2f and Table S3), it shows a dominant peak at ∼1.9 Å. It indicates that the Co–N scattering path, and no Co–Co scattering was found, which confirms that the Co element in Co-NC exists in the form of single atoms. However, for Co-MS-NC, it displays two scattering peaks (Fig. 2g and Table S3), Co-N (1.91 Å, namely CoN3 coordinated structure) and Co-Co (2.82 Å, namely Co5N3 coordinated structure), proving that Co exists as single atoms and clusters in Co-MS-NC. Wavelet transform (WT) is a local transformation of space (time) and frequency, which can effectively extract information from the signals [43,44]. We use a Morlet function for WT analysis (Fig. 2e, f) and confirmed the occurrence of cluster phenomenon. 2.2 Electrochemical performance of catalysts To validate the synergy between the Co single atoms and clusters, we used the rotating disc electrode (RDE) and rotating ring disc electrode (RRDE) to measure the ORR performance under alkaline conditions (0.1 M KOH). We first performed cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests on the catalysts under nitrogen and oxygen-saturated conditions, respectively. It can be noticed that a clear reduction peak occurred at 0.8 V under the oxygen saturated condition but was not observed under the nitrogen saturated condition (Fig. S13). This indicates that the Co-MS-NC-(1:5) catalyst has excellent ORR performance. For a more accurate result, we tried different dosages of catalyst loading to determine the ideal sample loading (Fig. S14). To demonstrate the impact of Co clusters on Co single atoms, we conducted a comparison of Co-MS-NC-(1:5/10/20) with Co-NC, NC and Pt/C catalysts (Fig. 3 a and Fig. S15). Co-MS-NC-(1:5/10/20) catalysts process demonstrated a significant improvement over the Co-NC and NC catalysts. Among them, Co-MS-NC-(1:5) holds the best ORR performance with an onset potential (E onset) of 0.93 V and a half-wave potential (E 1/2) of 0.823 V, which was very close to the performance of commercial Pt/C catalysts. Additionally, Co-MS-NC-(1:5) has a limiting current density (jL = 5.62 mA cm−2), which is superior to commercial Pt/C (jL = 5.16 mA cm−2). Fig. 3b illustrates the linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) curves of Co-MS-NC-(1:5) catalysts at different rotational speeds, and it can be found that the current density exhibits a uniform variation as the rotational speed is changed. This proves that the catalyst exhibits first-order kinetic process controlled by diffusion. Fig. 3c shows the K-L plot derived from Fig. 3b, where the electron transfer rate calculated from the K-L equation is 3.8. The Tafel slope plot (Fig. 3d) reveals that Co-MS-NC-(1:5) exhibits a Tafel slope of 63.58 mV/dec, which is nearly identical to that of Pt/C (51.74 mV/dec), and significantly surpasses that of Co-NC (114.05 mV/dec) and NC (139.95 mV/dec). This suggests that the catalytic process of Co-MS-NC-(1:5) has highly accelerated kinetics during the ORR process. After 12 h of i-t timescale testing, the current density only decreased by only 9.4%, demonstrating that the Co-MS-NC-(1:5) catalyst has excellent electrochemical stability in an alkaline environment (Fig. 3e). Methanol tolerance is a vital criterion for assessing catalysts in batteries. After adding 5 mL methanol to the electrolyte, the current density of the Co-MS-NC-(1:5) catalyst exhibited a negligible change, whereas commercial Pt/C showed a more pronounced variation (Fig. 3f). This indicates that Co-MS-NC-(1:5) catalyst is unaffected by methanol crossover and has excellent methanol tolerance. Subsequently, we compared the onset potentials, half-wave potential and Tafel slopes of Co-NC, Co-MS-NC-(1:5/10/20), the commercial Pt/C and NC catalysts (Fig. S16). Most reports indicate that catalytic efficiency in ORR reactions increases with four-electron transfer compared to two-electron transfer [45,46]. To further discuss the reaction mechanism of the Co-MS-NC-(1:5) catalyst, we investigated the electron transfer number n and H2O2 yield of the Co-MS-NC-(1:5) and the commercial Pt/C catalysts by RRDE (Fig. S17). The results showed that the electron transfer number (Fig. S18) of the Co-MS-NC-(1:5) catalysts ranged from 3 to 4, which was in consistent with the results calculated by the K-L equation (Fig. 3c). This indicates that the reaction occurs through both two-electron and four-electron pathways, but the latter was the dominant one. In addition, the Co-MS-NC-(1:5) catalyst holds a certain H2O2 yield compared with Pt/C catalysts. 2.3 Application in Zn-air battery To further explore the practical applications of the catalyst, we assembled it as a cathode catalyst into ZAB for testing and compared with the commercial Pt/C catalysts (Fig. 4 a). The ZAB assembled by Co-MS-NC-(1:5) catalyst displayed a higher open-circuit potential (OCP) of 1.5 V than that of commercial Pt/C (1.49 V, Fig. 4b). The discharge polarization curve and power density curve (Fig. 4c) of ZAB show that Co-MS-NC-(1:5) based ZAB has a maximum power density of 146.61 mW cm−2, surpassing that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst (90.66 mW cm−2) and also superior to the most of the reported ZAB [47–50]. Impressively, Co-MS-NC-(1:5) based ZAB demonstrates a specific capacity of 786.0 mAh g−1 at current density of 20 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4d), which is almost equal to the theoretical capacity of 820.0 mAh g−1. Subsequently, we performed some constant current charge–discharge tests. It is noteworthy that a stable discharge plateau exists at both low (Fig. 4e) and high (Fig. 4f) current densities, which is superior to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. There is a tendency for the voltage to decrease gradually with increasing current density, revealing the outstanding reversibility of Co-MS-NC-(1:5) based ZAB. In addition, we compared the ZAB performance of the catalysts with those recent reports (Table S4) to demonstrate the superior performance of our synthesized catalysts. Through electrochemical activity and ZAB performance tests, we have verified that the catalysts produced by mixed molten salts pyrolysis with unique ultra-thin 2D nanosheet morphology, large specific surface area, abundant micro/mesoporous, and single atoms and clusters co-loaded structure have excellent electrochemical properties. 2.4 Theoretical calculation and ORR mechanism To gain further understanding of the catalytic mechanism of the Co-MS-NC catalysts, based on the fitting results (Table S3), we constructed CoN3 (corresponding to Co-NC), Co5N3 and CoN3-Co5N3 (corresponding to Co-MS-NC) models (Fig. S19) to perform DFT calculations (Tables S5 and S6). We calculated the Gibbs free energies for each ORR reaction step of the CoN3, Co5N3 and CoN3-Co5N3 models (Fig. 5 a, b). In addition, the corresponding adsorption intermediates (OOH*, O* and OH*) of CoN3, Co5N3 and CoN3-Co5N3 are listed in Fig. S20. It can be found that Co single atoms act as the real active sites during the ORR, while the Co clusters do not. The latter plays a role as a moderator for the electron configuration of single atoms. This is because the Co clusters are poisoned by OH− 1 during the reaction. For Co single atoms (CoN3 coordination), the RDS is O2→*OOH, which requires an energy cost of 0.35 eV, as for Co clusters (Co5N3 coordination), the RDS is *O→*OH (with an energy cost of 0.99 eV). When single atoms and clusters coexist (CoN3-Co5N3 coordination), the RDS changes from O2→*OOH to *OOH→*O with an energy cost of 0.29 eV. This is because the Co clusters have a certain modulating effect on the Co single atoms, with enhanced adsorption of *OOH and weakened adsorption of *O and *OH. During the alkaline ORR reaction, O2 gains electrons and eventually generates OH−. There is an equilibrium process between the intermediate products *OH and OH− in the system, so we took the OH coverage of the active site into consideration. The red boxes in Fig. S21 show the coverage of active sites in the CoN3, Co5N3 and CoN3-Co5N3 models. Fig. 5d–f shows the electron density difference for the three models and the corresponding Bader values. It can be found that the introduction of Co clusters leads to a relatively higher valence state in the active site of the Co single atoms. This is because the position of the hanging bond position loses more charge, resulting in the formation of empty orbitals. These empty orbitals are prone to adsorb O2 and receive electrons from the external circuit to form *OOH, thus accelerating the ORR reaction process. To further explore the effect of Co clusters on Co single atoms, we used partial density of states (PDOS) and d-band center theory to analyze the adsorption strength of the intermediates on the different active sits. Compared to Co single atom (Co5N3 in Fig. 5g), Co cluster possesses a lower d-band center energy (−1.5291 eV of Co5N3). Such lower energy can result in an excessive adsorption of intermediate during the ORR process, leading to the *O→*OH step producing a low potential, thereby reducing the ORR activity of the catalyst. When Co single atom and Co cluster coexist (Fig. 5h), the introduction of cluster will raise the d-band center energy of the single atom (−1.3407 eV of CoN3 to −1.2651 eV of CoN3-Co5N3). Based on theoretical calculations, the synergistic catalytic mechanism is proposed for the co-loading of single atoms and clusters in alkaline media (Fig. 5c). When clusters and single atoms co-exist, the former has a moderating effect on the electrons surrounding the latter, weakening the adsorption of *O and *OH and enhancing the adsorption of *OOH, thus changing the RDS of the reaction and directly increasing the ORR catalytic activity. 3 Conclusions In summary, we have designed a dimensional reduction strategy to “strip and etch” 3D Co-ZIF into 2D Co-MS-NC with ultrathin (3.5 nm) nanosheet structure by using mixed molten salts (LiCl/KCl) acting as the stripping and etching agent. Significantly, compared with the single atoms Co-NC catalyst obtained by direct carbonization, our Co-MS-NC catalyst produced by mixed molten salts pyrolysis method can introduce some Co clusters, and the synergistic effect between clusters and single atoms will greatly enhance the catalytic performance. Theoretical calculations and experimental results also collectively indicate that Co clusters enable regulating Co single atoms, and the Co clusters increases the d-band center energy of Co single atoms, enhances the adsorption of *OOH, and weakens the adsorption of *O and *OH. As a result, it causes the RDS to change from O2→*OOH to *OOH→*O, rendering the catalyst to exhibit excellent electrochemical activity. Our method overcomes the dimensional limitations of ZIF-derived 3D nitrogen-carbon materials and provides unique insights into understanding symbiotic single atom-cluster catalytic mechanisms.

        "dc:description": "Two-dimensional (2D) materials loaded with single atoms and clusters are being set at the forefront of catalysis due to their distinctive geometric and electronic features. However, the usually-complicated synthesis procedures impede in-depth clarification of their catalytic mechanisms. To this end, herein we developed an efficient one-step dimension-reduction carbonization strategy, with which we successfully architected a highly-efficient catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), featured with symbiotic cobalt single atoms and clusters decorated in two-dimensional (2D) ultra-thin (3.5 nm thickness) nitrogen-carbon nanosheets. The synergistic effects of the two components afford excellent oxygen reduction activity in alkaline media (E 1/2 = 0.823 V vs. RHE) and thereof a high power density (146.61 mW cm−2) in an assembled Zn-air battery. As revealed by theoretical calculations, the cobalt clusters can regulate electrons surrounding those individual atoms and affect the adsorption of intermediate species. As a consequence, the derived active sites of single cobalt atoms lead to a significant improvement of the ORR performance. Thus, our work may fuel interests to delicate architecture of single atoms and clusters coexisting 2D support toward optimal electrocatalytic performance.",
