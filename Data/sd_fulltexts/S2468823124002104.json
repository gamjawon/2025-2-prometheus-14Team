Three Pd/Beta zeolite catalysts with low, intermediate and high support Si/Al2 (SAR) ratios were synthesized for methane combustion in both fresh and hydrothermally aged forms. SAR was found to dramatically influence catalyst performance and hydrothermal stability. Via an array of structural and textural characterizations, it is discovered that (1) at low SAR, catalyst deactivation is due primarily to the transformation of catalytically active PdO to inactive Pd2+-ions via protonolysis; (2) at intermediate SAR, catalyst deactivation during aging is due partly to the protonolysis chemistry, and partly to Al-decoration of the remaining PdO particles; (3) at high SAR, both of these deactivation mechanisms are greatly mitigated, leading to much improved catalyst hydrothermal stability. Our work here demonstrates that PdO particles stabilized by silanol nests, sites that are highly active for methane combustion, can only survive harsh hydrothermal aging at very high support SAR.

Catalytic combustion is the primary route for reducing tailpipe methane emissions to meet the ever-stringent environmental legislations [2]. Pd-based catalysts are considered the most efficient catalysts for the combustion of low concentrations of methane within lean-combustion engine exhausts, and PdO is generally agreed to be the catalytically active phase [3,4]. Unfortunately, methane combustion over the prevailing Pd/Al2O3 catalysts suffer from severe water inhibition, and the catalysts are frequently plagued by water-induced deactivation [5]. Over the past decades, great efforts have been exerted to address water inhibition [6–9] and water-induced catalyst deactivation [10–14] issues of the Pd/Al2O3 catalytic system. An important class of alternative catalysts are zeolite supported Pd; some of which have shown great potential for practical applications [15–18]. Unlike Pd/Al2O3 catalysts where Pd stays predominately as PdO particles under low temperature methane combustion conditions in excess O2, Pd can in principle stay as isolated Pd-ions, PdO clusters within zeolite cages or channels, and PdO particles attached to zeolite external surfaces [15]. As such, zeolite topology and composition (Si/Al2 ratio, SAR) can exert profound influences on the performance and stability of Pd/zeolite catalysts. In the pioneering work by Li and Armor [19], the authors discovered that Pd/zeolites display much higher activities than Pd/Al2O3 at comparable Pd loadings, and attributed this to the high activity of isolated Pd-ions. This notion has been demonstrated incorrect by more recent studies. For example, Cui et al. [15] demonstrated that in Pd/chabazite catalysts, methane combustion rates are orders of magnitude higher than those on isolated Pd-ions. Similarly, by introducing Co2+ ions to Pd/beta zeolite (Pd/BEA) to prevent atomic dispersion of Pd, Chen et al. [20] demonstrated marked improvement in methane combustion activity. Regarding locations of the catalytically active PdO species on zeolites, Chen et al. [21] proposed that highly active PdO species are anchored by “silanol nests” in Pd/MFI (SAR = 1060) zeolite catalysts. In a recent review article by the same authors, this proposal has been more clearly demonstrated [22]. Silanol nests have also been suggested to be the anchoring sites for finely dispersed PdO particles in Pd/TS-1 [23], Pd/MCM-41 [24] and Pd/SBA-15 [25] catalysts. Among various zeolite supports, beta zeolite has attracted much research attention due to its large surface area, high thermal and hydrothermal stability, and widely variable SAR. Friberg et al. [26] reported that for methane oxidation in the presence of H2O, Pd/BEA with high SAR displays much higher low-temperature activity and time-on-stream stability than Pd/Beta with low SAR or Pd/Al2O3; based on which, the authors concluded that support hydrophobicity is beneficial to catalyst performance and stability. More recently, we also studied Pd/BEA methane combustion catalysts with a wide range of SAR [27], and discovered additional SAR effects on Pd speciation, activity, and on-stream stability of the catalysts. We note that in both studies described immediately above, hydrothermal aging effects were not systematically addressed. However, hydrothermal stability and resistance to poisoning (e.g., sulfur) are the most important criteria for practical deployments of emission control catalysts [28–31]. In the present study, we compare three Pd/BEA catalysts with different SAR in their fresh and hydrothermally aged forms, through reaction kinetics and an array of catalyst characterizations with XRD, N2 physisorption, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, XPS, FTIR and imaging. We are particularly interested in elucidating the roles of silanol nests in influencing the distribution of Pd species and the activity/stability of the catalysts. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation A commercial H-BEA (SAR = 32, denoted H-Beta32 here) was acquired from Weifu Environmental Catalysts Co., Ltd., China. Two higher SAR supports, denoted H-Beta402 and H-Beta1178 (SAR = 402 and 1178, respectively), were prepared with an oxalic acid dealumination method, where oxalic acid acts both as a leaching and chelating agent to remove Al from the parent H-Beta32 [32]. More details regarding their preparation are shown in Table S1. Pd/BEA catalysts with a nominal Pd loading of 0.5 wt.% were prepared with an incipient wetness impregnation method. The as-prepared Pd/BEA catalysts were calcined at 600 °C for 3 h in air as “fresh” catalysts, which are denoted Pd/Beta32_f, Pd/Beta402_f and Pd/Beta1178_f in the following. More details on catalyst preparation can be found elsewhere [27]. A portion of the fresh catalysts were further hydrothermally aged at 700 °C for 24 h in flowing 10 % H2O/air; these are denoted Pd/Beta32_a, Pd/Beta402_a and Pd/Beta1178_a. The aging temperature of 700 °C was chosen here for two reasons. First, the emission temperatures of lean-burn natural gas engines are typically below 650 °C [33,34]. Second, phase transition from PdO to metallic Pd occurs above 750 °C; such high temperatures must be avoided [35]. For comparison purposes, a portion of the fresh H-BEA supports were also hydrothermally aged in the same way; these are denoted H-Beta32_a, H-Beta402_a and H-Beta1178_a. 2.2 Methane combustion performance evaluation Methane combustion (CH4 + 2O2 = CO2 + 2H2O) experiments were conducted on a home-built plug flow reactor system coupled with a MKS 2030 gas analyzer to record inlet and outlet concentrations of CH4, and outlet concentrations of CO and CO2. Light-off test procedures are as follows: First, 100 mg catalyst diluted with 900 mg quartz was fixed in a packed-bed tubular reactor (inner diameter 1.2 cm). The catalyst was pretreated at 500 °C in a 5 % O2/N2 flow for 30 min. Second, the catalyst bed was cooled to 200 °C in a N2 flow. Third, the reactant feed ([CH4] = 2000 ppm, [O2] = 5 %, [H2O] = 0 % or 8 %, balanced with N2) was introduced to the reactor. Upon stabilization, the catalyst bed was ramped to 600 °C at 10 °C /min. Light-off tests were repeated three times. The second and third light-off curves typically fully overlap suggesting that the catalysts became stabilized after the first light-off test. As such, results from the second light-off measurements are reported in this study. During the measurements, the total flow was maintained at 500 mL/min and the gaseous hourly space velocity (GHSV) was 36,000 h−1. Methane conversion = ([CH4]in–[CH4]out)/[CH4]in × 100 %, where [CH4]in and [CH4]out refer to the inlet and out concentrations of methane. Catalyst stability was evaluated by time-on-stream tests conducted on the same apparatus. Stabilized catalysts after three cycles of light-off measurements were used here. The procedure was the same as the light-off tests except that the tests were carried out at constant temperatures (450 °C in the absence of water and 500 °C in the presence of water). Such test durations were 90 min. 2.3 Catalyst characterizations Pd, Si and Al contents of the catalysts were determined via inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), conducted on a Plasma 1500 (NCS) instrument. Specific surface areas and porosity of the catalysts were determined by N2 physisorption, carried out on a Micromeritics ASAP 2460 instrument at −196 °C. Before N2 adsorption, the catalyst samples were degassed at 300 °C for 12 h under dynamic vacuum. Specific surface areas were calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The distribution of the micropores was analyzed using the Horvath-Kawazoe method and that of the mesopores was analyzed using the Barrett-Joiner-Halenda (BJH) method. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements was conducted on a Haoyuan DX-2700BH instrument using Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å). Data were collected with 2θ ranging from 5 to 45° using a step size of 0.01°. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted on a Thermo K-ALPHA instrument equipped with an Al Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV). Pd 3d region spectra were acquired from 330 to 346 eV with a step size of 1.0 eV. Binding energies (BE) were calibrated using adventitious carbon (C 1s BE at 284.8 eV) as the reference. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed on a JEM-2100F microscope operated at 200 kV. The images were acquired with a HAADF detector. The probe convergence angle was set to 25 mrad. Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) studies were conducted on a Thermo Scientific Apreo 2 instrument operated at 10 kV. The images were acquired with a T2 detector and the spot size was set to 8.0. The durations for EDS mapping scan were 10 min. Regarding sample preparation, 2 mg catalyst was dispersed in 5 mL ethanol, followed by sonication for 30 min. About one drop of the as-prepared mixture was taken on a 3 mm copper grid and allowed to dry in room temperature. Ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) measurements were conducted on the same plug-flow reactor system described above. Experiential details are as follows. First, the catalyst was pre-oxidized in a 5 % O2/N2 flow at 500 °C for 30 min. Second, the catalyst was cooled to 100 °C in a N2 flow. Third, a 500 mL/min gas flow containing 500 ppm NH3 balanced with N2 was introduced to the reactor, and NH3 adsorption was carried out for two hours to ensure saturation. Following which, a pure N2 flow was applied to purge physisorbed NH3. Finally, the catalyst was ramped to 600 °C at 10 °C /min, in the meanwhile desorbed NH3 was recorded by the MKS 2030 gas analyzer described above. Temperature-programmed reduction with H2 (H2-TPR) was conducted on a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 instrument equipped with a TCD detector. The procedure is as follows. First, 100 mg catalyst was loaded in a quartz reactor and pre-oxidized at 500 °C for 30 min in a 5 % O2/N2 flow. Second, an Ar flow was introduced to purge O2, and the reactor was cooled to −80 °C by contacting liquid N2. Third, a 30 mL/min 10 % H2/Ar flow was introduced to the catalyst sample held at −80 °C until stabilization of the TCD signals. Finally, the sample was ramped to 600 °C at 10 °C/min; in the meantime, TCD signals were recorded. Diffused Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) measurements were collected on a Thermo Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a liquid N2-cooled mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector. Spectra were collected in the hydroxyl stretching region from 4000 to 2500 cm−1 to characterize the change of silanol nests before and after Pd loading, and before and after hydrothermal aging. Before the tests, all samples were pre-oxidized at 500 °C for 30 min in a 5 % O2/N2 flow and cooled to 25 °C in a N2 flow. The temperature was maintained at 25 °C during spectra acquisition. To eliminate the influence of gas-phase water, the experiments were conducted under dry N2 purging achieved by passing the N2 flow through a cryocooler held at −80 °C to trap moisture. All spectra reported here were subtracted using KBr spectra acquired following the same treatment conditions as the catalyst samples. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Textural properties of the catalysts Table 1 presents BET surface areas and micropore volumes of the fresh and hydrothermally aged catalysts. We note that the corresponding values for the H-form supports are essentially the same as the fresh catalysts, and are therefore not shown. Consistent with prior work by Roberge et al. [36], dealumination treatments of the Beta32 support led to the formation of localized defects, therefore increased surface areas and pore volumes for Beta402 and Beta1178. For all three catalysts, hydrothermal aging at 700 °C only slightly degrades their textural properties. Direct comparison between the fresh catalysts and their aged counterparts reveals that hydrothermal stability increases with support SAR. Note particularly that with an increasing SAR order, pore volumes of the aged catalysts decrease 18 %, 8 % and 7 %, respectively, as compared to their fresh counterparts (Fig. S1). Such decreases can have two causes: aging induced pore destruction and pore clogging. Pd contents of the catalysts are also shown in Table 1; these are very close to the nominal loading of 0.5 wt.% (47.0 μmol gcat −1). XRD patterns of the fresh and aged catalysts are presented in Fig. S3. All samples maintain pure BEA structure characterized by strong diffraction peaks at 2θ = 7° and 23° [16]. This clearly demonstrates that neither dealumination nor hydrothermal aging causes strong degradation of the Beta support, in full consistency with the surface area/porosity results shown in Table 1. No PdO diffractions are detected here. In our previous studies by STEM [27], PdO nanoparticles in the range of 3.5–8.0 nm are indeed detected in our fresh catalysts. Therefore, their undetectability by XRD here is due mainly to the low Pd loading. Chemical titrations, spectroscopic and microscopic characterizations of the catalysts will be shown below to provide more details on Pd dispersion and speciation. 3.2 Light-off and time-on-stream behavior of the catalysts in methane combustion Methane combustion light-off plots for the fresh and hydrothermally aged catalysts are presented in Fig. 1 a and b for measurements carried out in dry and wet reactant feed, respectively. Based on the light-off temperatures, two points are worth noting for the data: (a) Consistent with prior studies, both fresh and aged catalysts experience water inhibition during reaction with varying severity; as expected, water inhibition becomes less severe with increasing support SAR, i.e., hydrophobicity [37]. (b) All three fresh catalysts experience deactivation from hydrothermal aging, again with varying severity. Interestingly, whereas the activity order of the fresh catalysts follows Pd/Beta402_f > Pd/Beta1178_f > Pd/Beta32_f, largely determined by PdO content and PdO exposure [27], that of the aged samples follows Pd/Beta1178_a > Pd/Beta402_a > Pd/Beta32_a. In other words, aging induced catalyst deactivation also becomes less severe with increasing support SAR. For Pd/Beta32, since methane combustion activity becomes almost completely lost after aging, the nature of catalytically active PdO must have undergone marked changes. To reveal whether hydrothermal aging also induces dramatic changes to PdO in Pd/Beta402 and Pd/Beta1178, Arrhenius analysis of the light-off data was carried out. Since methane combustion rates over oxygen-saturated Pd catalysts (including PdO) are typically first order with respect to methane pressure and zero order to O2 pressure [38], reaction rates were normalized using the first-order kinetic equation, i.e., r = F W ( − ln ( 1 − x ) ) , where F is the inlet CH4 flow rate (moles of CH4 per s), w the mass of the catalyst (g), and x the CH4 conversion. Normalized rates were then subjected to Arrhenius analysis, and the lower temperature linear region Ln(r) vs. 1000/T plots are shown in Fig. 1c and d, respectively. From the apparent activation energies derived from these plots, it is rather clear that for all samples (except the completely deactivated Pd/Beta32_a), Ea values are considerably lower under “dry” measurements consistent with the H2O inhibition effect reported previously [39]. Support SAR also plays certain roles affecting Ea values; for both fresh and aged catalysts and for both “dry” and “wet” measurements, it is generally observed that lower SAR leads to lower Ea values. Most importantly, marked difference is found between Pd/Beta402 and Pd/Beta1178. For measurements carried out in the presence of water, Pd/Beta402_a displays a dramatic Ea decrease as compared with Pd/Beta402_f (121 kJ/mol versus 185 kJ/mol); in contrast, Ea values for fresh and aged Pd/Beta1178 are much closer. Such a difference suggests that hydrothermal aging induces rather large changes to the nature of PdO in Pd/Beta402 but not that in Pd/Beta1178. More discussions to this important difference will be given below. Time-on-stream stability tests of the catalysts were also conducted, as shown in Fig. S4. A few observations are worth noting here. First, the order of activity is consistent with the light-off test results in Fig. 1. Second, all fresh catalysts show a relatively stable methane conversion in the absence of water but a slow deactivation in the presence of water. Third, for aged samples, Pd/Beta1178_a shows much better stability than Pd/Beta32_a and Pd/Beta402_a. All of these observations are consistent with recent studies by Friberg et al. [14] who revealed that Pd/BEA with higher support hydrophobicity (i.e., higher SAR) shows better time-on-stream stability. One interesting observation is that Pd/Beta402_f appears to show better stability than Pd/Beta402_a. Since support hydrophobicity is not anticipated to decrease with hydrothermal aging, the inferior performance for Pd/Beta402_a also suggests that the nature of PdO active species is adversely influenced by hydrothermal aging. Note that Lu et al. also observed similar unexpected behavior for Pd/MFI zeolite catalysts (SAR = 100 or 400) hydrothermal aged at 700 °C [40]. Again, more discussions will be given below regarding hydrothermal aging effects to PdO. In short, our methane combustion test results above reveal strong SAR effects on catalyst activity and stability. The low SAR Pd/Beta32 shows moderate activity in the fresh from but nearly complete deactivation in the aged form; the intermediate SAR Pd/Beta402 shows excellent activity in the fresh from but marked deactivation after aging. The high SAR Pd/Beta1178, in contrast, shows good performance in the fresh from and the best durability after aging. Next, we aim to provide some molecular-level understating about such strong SAR effects based on chemical titrations, spectroscopic and microscopic studies. 3.3 NH3-TPD and H2-TPR titrations Possible acidic sites in Pd/BEA include Lewis acid sites (e.g., extraframework Al3+ species, Pdn+ ions) and Brønsted acid sites (AlO(H)Si). Note that Beta zeolite has 9 different Al T-sites, leading to an arrange of Brønsted acid strength. Based on prior literature, NH3 desorption below ∼250 °C can be attributed to weak acid sites, whereas that above ∼250 °C can be attributed to strong acid sites [41,42]. NH3-TPD profiles for the fresh and aged catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 a. Since every sample displays at least 3 desorption states and not necessarily at fixed temperatures, herein we describe these profiles qualitatively without making precise peak assignments, albeit it is most certain that the ∼150 °C state can be assigned to NH3 desorption from extraframework Al3+, and desorption above ∼250 °C to Brønsted acid sites. In comparing the fresh and aged pairs of Pd/Beta32 and Pd/Beta402, it is rather clear that hydrothermal aging causes losses of the most acidic Brønsted acid sites. Two causes are possible for such losses: dealumination during aging, and/or “protonolysis” reaction between PdO and Brønsted acid sites, i.e., PdO + 2H+ → Pd2+ +H2O [43]. In comparison with Pd/Beta1178_f, Pd/Beta1178_a does not display loss of higher temperature NH3 desorption; on the contrary, it even slightly increases. The quantified total NH3 yields are depicted in Fig. 2b, showing that Pd/Beta32_a and Pd/Beta402_a display remarkable NH3 yield losses of 41 and 33 %, respectively, as compared to their fresh counterparts. In contrast, Pd/Beta1178_a only displays 6 % loss as compared to Pd/Beta1178_f. To gain detailed Pd speciation of the catalysts, H2-TPR was carried out and the results are shown in Fig. 3 . Using the Pd/Beta32 samples shown in Fig. 3a as an example, 4 H2 consumption (or release) states are observed, denoted α, β, γ and δ in the plot. Based on prior studies [44,45], their assignments are as follows: (1) the α state is attributed to H2 consumption from a combination of PdO reduction to metallic Pd, and the subsequent formation of Pd hydride, PdHx; (2) the β state is due to H2 release from PdHx dissociation, As such, peak area difference between the α and β states represents PdO content; (3) the γ and δ states are due to H2 consumption from the reduction of isolated Pd2+ ions held at different extraframework positions. More specifically, the γ state is due to Pd2+ ions next to T3∼T9, and the δ state is due to Pd2+ ions next to T1∼T2 [44,45]. In other words, Pd2+ ions formed from protonolysis between PdO and strong Brønsted acid sites are more difficult to reduce than Pd2+ ions formed between PdO and weaker Brønsted acid sites. The results for the Pd/Beta402 and Pd/Beta178 samples are shown in Fig. 3b and c, respectively. These are similar to results of the Pd/Beta32 samples, except that the γ state is barely detected on Pd/Beta178. Based on peak area analysis, the PdO and Pd2+ species in each catalyst are quantified as follows: the PdO content is calculated by subtracting the area of peak β from the area of peak α, and the Pd2+ content is calculated by summing γ and δ peaks areas. It is interesting to note that the combined PdO and Pd2+ content thus determined for each catalyst is essentially equal to that determined by ICP-OES. In other words, PdO and Pd2+ are essentially the only Pd moieties present in our catalysts. The quantified PdO and Pd2+ contents, as well as their relative percentages, are tabulated in Table 2 . The results shown in Table 2 are important for our interpreting of the methane combustion behavior of the catalysts shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. S4. Particularly, the aging induced deactivation of Pd/Beta32 and Pd/Beta402 is at least partly due to protonolysis of catalytically active PdO to inactive Pd2+ ions. In conjunction with the NH3-TPD results shown in Fig. 2a, it is clear that during hydrothermal aging, protonolysis primarily occurs between PdO and strong Brønsted acid sites, leading to the formation of “δ” Pd2+ ions. It is also interesting to note from Fig. 3 that the temperatures of the α reduction state are not the same for different samples. For the fresh catalysts, the α state is centered at 1.5, 11.0 and 17.0 °C, respectively, as a function of increasing SAR. In our recent study [27], PdO particle sizes in the fresh catalysts were measured on the basis of STEM imaging, as ∼3.1, 4.5 and 8.0 nm, also as a function of increasing SAR. Clearly, PdO reduction temperature increases with increasing particle size. PdO reduction temperatures for Pd/Beta32_a and Pd/Beta402_a are 31.4, 34.6 and 18.7 °C, respectively. Interestingly, Pd/Beta1178_a displays two peaks in the α region, a prominent one at 18.7 °C, and a much weaker one at 43.0 °C. In addition to PdO particle growth during aging, other causes may also play some roles for the rather large increases in PdO reduction temperatures (above 30 °C). Additional discussions will be given below based on more characterizations. 3.4 The roles of silanol nests in accommodating PdO as probed by DRIFTS Inspired by the work from Chen et al. who employed FTIR to probe how silanol nests host PdO particles [21], herein we studied the -OH stretching vibrational region spectra for the fresh and aged H-Beta supports and fresh and aged Pd/Beta catalysts, aiming to understand the locations of PdO particles in fresh catalysts, and their migration and transformation during hydrothermal aging. The results are shown in Fig. 4 . We note first that a wide range of νOH peaks are observed for each sample, and their assignments are as follows [46–48]: 3781 cm−1 (extra-framework Al-OH), 3741 cm−1 (external surface SiOH), 3732 cm−1 (internal SiOH), 3685 cm−1 (internal AlOH), 3602 cm−1 (Brønsted acid, SiO(H)Al), and the broad peak centered at ∼3510 cm−1 (silanol nest). By comparing the relative intensities of the various νOH peaks, the following salient points are worth noting: (a) Whereas the fresh H-Beta32 support displays a low intensity silanol nest peak, those of the fresh H-Beta402 and H-Beta1178 are much stronger, confirming that oxalic acid dealumination induces formation of silanol nests. Hydrothermal aging of the H-Beta402 and H-Beta1178 samples causes dramatic drop of the silanol nest peaks, likely due to silanol condensation reactions, i.e., SiOH + HOSi → SiOSi + H2O. In other words, hydrothermal aging effectively destroys silanol nests. (b) Silanol nest peak intensities for Pd/Beta402_f and Pd/Beta1178_f are lower than their corresponding fresh H-Beta supports, clearly demonstrating that PdO anchoring is associated with silanol nests. However, this is not the case for Pd/Beta32_f, due likely to the fact that the H-Beta32 support has a low silanol nest concentration. (c) As compared to H-Beta402_a and H-Beta1178_a, silanol nest intensities for Pd/Beta402_a and Pd/Beta1178_a are higher, indicating that PdO and silanol nests form rather stable ensembles against hydrothermal destruction. 3.5 Pd migration and agglomeration as probed by XPS and microscopic imaging Regarding Pd speciation variations during hydrothermal aging, our H2-TPR and NH3-TPD results collectively demonstrate extensive protonolysis of PdO (i.e., Pd redispersion) for support SAR at 32 and 402, but not at 1178. On the other hand, silanol nest damage during aging may induce PdO agglomeration since silanol nests serve as anchoring sites for PdO. To further elucidate Pd dispersion, Pd 3d region XPS measurements were carried out, and the results are shown in Fig. 5 . Since Pd 3d BE values for Pd-ions and PdO do not differ dramatically, herein we focus more on comparing relative signal intensities rather than BE values. Note first that for the fresh catalysts, Pd/Beta32_f signals are much stronger than Pd/Beta402_f and Pd/Beta1178_f. Comparison between fresh and aged samples reveals that (1) Pd/Beta32_a displays essentially the same signal intensities as Pd/Beta32_f; (2) Pd/Beta402_a displays considerably stronger signal intensities than Pd/Beta402_f; and (3) Pd/Beta1178_a displays slightly stronger signal intensities than Pd/Beta1178_f. In conjunction with PdO and Pd2+ quantification results shown in Table 2, and the fact that XPS measurements are surface sensitive, the XPS data here can only be rationalized by assuming that (i) isolated Pd2+ ions in all samples are uniformly dispersed, (ii) PdO particles that are not associated with silanol nests are uniformly dispersed, and (iii) PdO particles that are associated with silanol nests are encapsulated that display low XPS detectability. In other words, stable PdO-silanol nest guest-host pairs are stabilized within the zeolite bulk. Finally, microscopic imaging was carried out on the catalysts. Since we only examined a handful of particles and are uncertain about their representativeness, the results are only presented in SI as Fig. S5-S7. Tentatively, the results suggest that hydrothermal aging causes slight increases in PdO particle sizes at all SARs. Regarding precise locations of the PdO particles, no conclusions can be reached from our imaging results. 3.6 Correlation between Pd speciation and the activity/stability of the catalysts Despite the inspiring hypothesis by Chen et al. [22] that silanol nest defect sites serve as the anchoring sites for highly dispersed Pd nanoparticles, one has to realize that it is spatially impossible for the simplest silanol nest within a zeolite structure, i.e., 4 neighboring Si-OH formed by removal of a framework Al T-site, to host PdO particles in the range of ∼3–8 nm found in the present study. PdO particle growth is only feasible at the expense of the destruction of multiple neighboring zeolite unit cells. As such, hydrothermally stable PdO particles within the zeolite bulk should be stabilized by multiple silanol nests surrounding PdO. Likely driving force for such stabilization is stronger binding affinity between PdO and silanols than that between PdO and defect free -Si-O-Si- linkages. However, for zeolite supports with relative low SAR, destruction of zeolite unit cells inevitably forms “debris”, i.e., a mixture of Al2O3 and SiO2 species that no longer possess long range order. Via atom probe tomography (APT) studies, Cui et al. [15] demonstrated that the Al2O3 debris has much stronger affinity than SiO2 toward PdO, leading to the formation of an Al-rich layer surrounding encapsulated PdO. Furthermore, strong affinity between Al2O3 and PdO also facilitates the diffusion of extraframework Al formed during hydrothermal aging toward PdO particles, thus aggravating Al-Pd interactions. As compared with PdO on Pd/Al2O3, encapsulated PdO decorated with an Al-rich layer on Pd/zeolites may suffer less from sintering, but is still plagued with Al2O3-induced catalyst deactivation and H2O inhibition. For example, the support hydrophobicity effect in mitigating H2O inhibition becomes compromised when the PdO particles are surrounded by a hydrophilic Al-rich layer. Several pieces of information support the postulation that in our Pd/Beta32_a and Pd/Beta402_a, PdO particles are covered with a detrimental Al-rich overlayer, whereas in Pd/Beta1178_a, PdO particles are surrounded by the beneficial silanol nests. First, our NH3-TPD data shown in Fig. 2 demonstrate the loss of Brønsted acid sites during hydrothermal aging. Two causes are responsible for the loss: dealumination of the zeolite support, and protonolysis reaction between PdO and Brønsted acid sites. From the Pd2+ quantification results shown in Table 2, it is readily concluded that for Pd/Beta32 and Pd/Beta402, Brønsted acid loss from dealumination overwhelms that from protonolysis, leading eventually to Al enrichment around the PdO particles in Pd/Beta32_a and Pd/Beta402_a. On the other hand, during hydrothermal aging of Pd/Beta1178, the level of dealumination is negligible. Second, from the H2-TPR results shown in Fig. 3, Pd/Beta32_a and Pd/Beta402_a display considerably higher α state reduction temperatures than any of the other samples. Even though PdO sintering may have some contributions to such temperature rise, it is our belief that aluminum decoration is the main contributor. The aluminum decoration is very minor for Pd/Beta1178_a, generating an almost negligible reduction state at ∼43 °C. Finally, it is readily seen from Fig. 1d that Ea values for Pd/Beta402_f and Pd/Beta402_a are rather different, but those between Pd/Beta1178_f and Pd/Beta1178_a are similar; this also demonstrates that the PdO particles in Pd/Beta402_a are clearly different from the other three samples, i.e., they are Al-decorated. To summarize, we demonstrate here strong SAR influences on the performance of fresh and hydrothermally aged Pd/BEA methane combustion catalysts. Under our low Pd loading conditions, we demonstrate that protonolysis reaction readily occurs during hydrothermal aging at 700 °C. Even at an intermediate SAR of 402, this reaction still undergoes extensively, leading to marked loss of reactively active PdO species. Only at a high SAR of 1178, this reaction becomes negligible. Furthermore, low to intermediate SAR Pd/BEA catalysts also undergo facile dealumination during aging, and the Al species detached from the zeolite lattice readily migrates to PdO particles, forming a detrimental Al-rich layer that aggravates PdO deactivation and H2O inhibition. As such, our key conclusion here is that PdO particles encapsulated within zeolite supports and stabilized by silanol nests are indeed highly active and stable for methane combustion under oxygen rich conditions. However, high SAR zeolite supports must be applied to prevent their catalytic performance loss during hydrothermal aging. 4 Conclusions From methane combustion tests with and without the presence of water, it is found that catalytic activity and hydrothermal stability of low Pd-loaded (0.5 wt.%) Pd/BEA catalysts are greatly influenced by support SAR. For the low SAR Pd/Beta32 catalyst, hydrothermal aging at 700 °C for 24 h causes complete catalyst deactivation. Catalyst characterizations, in particular H2-TPR, reveal that this is due primarily to the protonolysis reaction between PdO and Brønsted acid sites of the beta support, i.e., PdO + 2H+ → Pd2+ + H2O. For the Pd/Beta402 and Pd/Beta1178 catalysts with intermediate and high SAR, respectively, DRIFTS studies clearly reveal connectivity between PdO and silanol nests of the supports. In line with recent proposals by Chen et al. [21,22], our data support the concept that silanol nest stabilized PdO are the highly active sites for methane combustion. However, hydrothermal stability for PdO in Pd/Beta402 and Pd/Beta1178 catalysts is vastly different. In Pd/Beta402, a portion of catalytically active PdO undergoes the protonolysis reaction and deactivates, whereas the remaining PdO becomes partly deactivated by an Al-decoration process, that is, extraframework Al moieties migrate to PdO forming an Al enriched layer surrounding PdO. In contrast, Pd/Beta1178 suffers from the least deactivation by hydrothermal aging; in other words, the silanol nest stabilized PdO is best protected against hydrothermal aging only at high support SAR. Two reasons are responsible for such superior hydrothermal stability: first, the lack of Brønsted acid sites at high SAR prevents PdO protonolysis; second, the lack of extraframework Al at high SAR prevents PdO decoration by a detrimental Al-rich layer. Our study here suggests that high support SAR is one of the most important criteria for the rational design of highly active and stable Pd/zeolite methane combustion catalysts.

        "dc:description": "Three Pd/Beta zeolite catalysts with low, intermediate and high support Si/Al2 (SAR) ratios were synthesized for methane combustion in both fresh and hydrothermally aged forms. SAR was found to dramatically influence catalyst performance and hydrothermal stability. Via an array of structural and textural characterizations, it is discovered that (1) at low SAR, catalyst deactivation is due primarily to the transformation of catalytically active PdO to inactive Pd2+-ions via protonolysis; (2) at intermediate SAR, catalyst deactivation during aging is due partly to the protonolysis chemistry, and partly to Al-decoration of the remaining PdO particles; (3) at high SAR, both of these deactivation mechanisms are greatly mitigated, leading to much improved catalyst hydrothermal stability. Our work here demonstrates that PdO particles stabilized by silanol nests, sites that are highly active for methane combustion, can only survive harsh hydrothermal aging at very high support SAR.",
