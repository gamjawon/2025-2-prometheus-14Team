Unlike Ziegler catalyst, the molecular weight of the polymer formed is not dependent on the ethylene pressure used during polymerization. An interpretation of this result is that chain termination by spontaneous /3-elimination is not frequent at the chosen polymerization conditions, and that the predominant chain termination reaction is /3-hydrogen transfer to monomer. On the other hand, the molecular weight is strongly dependent on the polymerization temperature. From experiments performed at different temperatures activation parameters have been estimated. From copolymerization experiments an estimate for the reactivity ratio between 1-hexene and ethylene has been calculated. The number of both vinyl and vinylidene fragments in the polymer increase with increased 1-hexene content in the reactor. The number of transvinylene fragments in the polymer is low, but this number also increases with increased 1-hexene content in the reactor. These results are discussed from the reaction scheme (Scheme 1). Keywords: chain transfer; chromium; ethylene; kinetics; polymerization; silica 1. Introduction The molecular weight of a polyolefin is usually its most important product property. Control of molecular weight when polymerizing olefins with Ziegler or chromium type of catalysts is for this reason an area of major industrial interest.

Changing polymerization conditions might change the properties of the population of active sites. However, it seems that successful correlations of data are obtained with simple kinetic models that assume that active sites properties do not change during the polymerization. This is frequently used for modelling Ziegler-Natta polymerization [ 1-3] and has also been used for polymerization with chromium/ silica catalysts [4,5]. The objective of the present study is to provide further insight into the application of such a kinetic model for chain termination on the chromium oxide/silica catalyst using ethylene and 1-hexene as monomers. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation A supported chromium catalyst was prepared by impregnating an aqueous solution of Cr03 on calcined silica (EP10 from Crosfield Catalysts, 1073 K) by the incipient wetness method. The amount of Cr03 used was chosen to give 1.0 wt.% Cr on the dry catalyst. After impregnation, the catalyst was dried at 353 K for 16 h, then activated in a flow of dry air at 988 K for 16 h, cooled to 623 K in dry, oxygen-free nitrogen and reduced by CO at 623 K for 3.5 h. The reduced catalyst was kept inert and mixed with dry, oxygen free white mineral oil to make a 10.71 wt.% catalyst slurry. The mineral oil had been purified by bubbling R. Blom et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 237-249 239 argon through the liquid and then passing the oil through a column filled with reduced Cr0/ Si02 catalyst. 2.2. Polymerization All polymerizations were performed in a water-cooled stainless steel autoclave with a magnetic driven stirrer. The apparatus allowed a constant pressure to be maintained in the reactor during the polymerization by continuously adding ethylene through a pressure control valve. The rate of polymerization could be followed on a flow meter on the ethylene inlet, and the temperature was measured by a thermocouple inside the autoclave. Isobutane was used as diluent. Both isobutane and ethylene were purified by passing through columns filled with molecular sieve type 4A. In some experiments hexene as comonomer was added from the start. Polymerization grade hexene purified by nitrogen stripping was used. 2.3. IR spectroscopy Approximately 500 l.r,m polymer discs for infrared measurements were made by pressing the polymer powder in an aluminum form sandwiched between two aluminum plates at 160 C at 90 bar for 5 min. The thickness of each polymer disc was measured by a micrometer to within t 10 Eim. The infrared spectra from 4000 to 400 cm-' were recorded on a Nicolet 5SX FTIR instrument. The quantitative measurements of total methyl content were performed according to ASTM D2238-68. The peaks at 908, 964 and 888 cm-' were used to estimate the vinyl, transvinylene and vinylidene content, respectively. The following formula was used to estimate the number of unsaturations per 1000 carbon atoms: n _14-A IOOOC p't*E (1) where A is the measured absorbance, p is the density of the polymer in g/cm3, t is the thickness of the polymer plate in cm, and a is the molar extinction coefficient of the band in I - (mol) -' - (cm) '. The molar extinction coefficient of the band at 908 cm-' was estimated from spectra of 1-dodecene to be 110(10) 1 - (mol) -' - (cm) '. For the band at 964 cm` a literature value of e=168 was used [ 6] . The extinction coefficient at 888 cm-' was estimated from spectra of 2,3-dimethylbutadiene to 146(10) 1 - (mol) -' - (cm) -'. The spectra of the brominated polymer plates were used as background. The numbers in parentheses denote the estimated uncertainties of the extinction coefficients. Each homopolymer chain produced with this catalyst (hydrogen being absent during polymerization) is assumed to have a methyl group on one end and a vinyl group on the other end. Since the vinyl content from experience is believed to be more accurately determined than the methyl content, the former was used to estimate M by the equation: 14 1000 Mn = (2) Nvinyl 240 R. Blom et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 237-249 where N,,iny, denotes the number of vinyl fragments per 1000 carbon atoms. For the copolymers the sum of vinyl, vinylidene and transvinylene fragments were used to estimate the Mn in a manner similar to that for the homopolymers: _ 14 1000 Mn Nvinyl +Nvinylidene +Ntransvinylene (2a) 2.4. Melt index measurements Melt index (MI) measurements were performed according to ASTM D1238 condition A, while high load melt index (HLMI) was measured in accordance with condition F of the same standard. 3. Kinetics 3.1. Homopolymerization The most simple system investigated in this study was homopolymerization of ethylene without any chain transfer agents such as molecular hydrogen present. For this system one propagation reaction and two termination reactions have to be considered. The rate constant for propagation with ethylene has been denoted kpE in the kinetic scheme. The rate constant for spontaneous (3-hydrogen elimination has been denoted kssE, and the rate constant for chain transfer or /3-hydrogen transfer to ethylene has been denoted kpE. If we consider all reactions to be of first order with respect to each component, the number average degree of polymerization can be written as: Xn - kpEPE[Cr*] kssEEPE[Cr*] +kBBE[Cr*] (3) where PE denotes the partial pressure of ethylene and [Cr*] denotes the concentration of active sites. Rewritten the equation yields: _1 -kaE _I k EE Xn kPE PE + kpE (4 ) By plotting 1 IX,, against 1 /PE the relative rate constants can be obtained. 3.2. Copolymerization When 1-hexene is used as comonomer in the polymerization to give a low content of hexene in the polymer, a few more reactions have to be considered. In order to simplify the system some assumptions have to be made. First, we have chosen to neglect the terms for termination by chain transfer to hexene with hexene as the last inserted monomer. This is for steric and statistical reasons. Also, the terms for propagation with hexene with hexene as the last inserted monomer can be neglected. With these assumptions the possible reactions R. Blom et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 237-249 241 are shown schematically in the kinetic scheme. In the scheme Cr' denotes an active site, E denotes ethylene and He denotes 1-hexene. He' indicates that the hexene is inserted with the butyl group a to the chromium atom (2,1 insertion) and the rate constants for these reactions are marked in a similar way. The propagation reactions are shown on the left hand side and the termination reactions are shown on the right hand side. From the scheme we see the reactions that take place in order to produce vinylidene (top), vinyl (middle) and transvinylene (bottom) fragments in the polymer. An expression for the mean degree of polymerization can then be made in the same manner as for homopolymerization. 4.

The numbers indicate that for the range of ethylene pressures chosen the only chain termination reaction that takes place is termination by chain transfer to ethylene and that spontaneous /3-hydrogen elimination is insignificant, i.e., kssE = 0. This was unexpected since it is contrary to experience with Ziegler/Ziegler-Natta catalysts that do seem to show a significant proportion of spontaneous ss-elimination at typical polymerization conditions [ 1,2j. The lack of spontaneous /3-elimination is reasonable at relatively high partial pres- 244 R. Blom et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 237-249 sures of ethylene since in this case the free coordination site is occupied by an ethylene molecule most of the time. This means that the rate-determining step for the termination reaction is the chain transfer to monomer, and that the coordination of ethylene to the active site is fast at the chosen conditions. This is consistent with the \"trigger mechanism\" that has been proposed for polymerization of a-olefins with Ziegler-Natta catalysts [7]. This model postulates a two monomer mechanism where the second monomer triggers the insertion reaction of the already complexed monomer. In our case the two possible reactions are either insertion or chain termination by chain transfer to ethylene. Formally, the active site as we have denoted [Cr'] will then include an already coordinated ethylene molecule. The transfer constant ratio, kssEE/kPE, of 1.71(8) X 10- 3 is somewhat larger than the one obtained for a hexavalent Cr03 /Si02 catalyst modified with Ti (OiPr)4 and (NH4)2SiF6 which yields a ratio of 0.94 X 10- 3 [ 5 ] . This means that the catalyst of the present study gives a lower average molecular weight number in homopolymerization than the modified hexavalent catalyst. However, some of the differences can be explained by the difference in polymerization temperature in the two studies, 360 and 368 K respectively. Since spontaneous elimination of ss-hydrogen is negligible, the first term of Eq. 4 can be omitted. Using the Arrhenius relation the difference in activation energy between the propagation and the termination steps can be estimated: =EP EKE 1+1n(AREE In ~ (5) R T APE Fig. 2 shows In( 1 /X ) versus 1 /T for the polymerizations performed in the temperature range 334-371 K. From the slope of the straight line the difference between the activation energy for propagation -and termination by chain transfer to monomer can be found, while the intercept gives the ratio between the frequency factors of the two reactions. From the data we find EP -EPEE= =26.7(2.0) kJ/mol and ln(Aj3EE)/(APE) =2.2(7).

They concluded that the concentration of active centers was constant during the polymerization and that the number of active sites was dependent on the ethylene pressure used. With an ethylene pressure of 1 bar only 3.2% of the chromium were active, while at 11 bar ethylene pressure the percentage of active chromium vas 7.3. From their data we estimated the concentration of active sites for the ethylene pressures used in the present study, neglecting that the concentration of such sites also may be temperature dependent. The propagation rate may be expressed as rpE -kpE[Cr*] [E] (6) From the activity data of Table 2 the propagation rate in moles of ethylene per second can be estimated at different temperatures. By also using the estimated concentrations of active sites and the ethylene concentrations in moles/ 1, we are able to estimate the absolute rate constant for propagation at different temperatures from Eq. 6. The average activation energy for propagation can then be obtained from the Arrhenius relation. By plotting In (kpE) versus 1/T the straight line through the quasi-linear interval (regression coefficient R=0.80) from 334 to 371 K gives an activation energy of propagation EP =75(15) kJ/ mol and an absolute value for the frequency factor In (ApE) = 34 (5) (i.e., ApE = 5.3 X 101') . The value for EP is somewhat larger than the previously published activation energy for this catalyst of 53 kJ/mol [9] and for the chromocene catalyst of 42 kJ/mol [4]. However, if we assume the concentration of active sites to be constant and independent of the ethylene pressure used we derive EP = 58 (12) kJ/mol which is much closer to the values previously reported. So the difference may well be a consequence of our way of handling the concentration of active sites in the calculations. The standard deviations of our study are, however, large, which probably is due to the large uncertainties in the activity data in the experiments. This again may be an effect of small amount of impurities. All the experiments were run with variable yield. It could be argued that this gives errors since it is known that molecular weight increases with increasing yield for hexavalent CrOx/ S'OZ catalyst [ 10]. This might be caused by a change in the properties of the active sites during the polymerization. However, this seems only to be the case for the hexavalent catalyst, and it has been shown that a prereduced catalyst as the one used in the present study gives a constant molecular weight with varying yield [ 11 ] indicating that the properties of the active sites do not change with yield for this catalyst. 4.2.

Karol [5] has previously investigated the hexavalent Cr03/SiO2 catalyst in copolymerization with 1-butene. He found a steady increase in the vinylidene content with an increase in the C4/CZ ratio in the reactor. At a CQ/C2 gas phase molar ratio of 0.09 the vinylidene accounted for about 36% of the total amount of unsaturation. The total amount of unsaturation increased with increasing amount of comonomer. This was interpreted as a decrease in average molecular weight number due to the greater ability of butene to cause chain termination. The catalyst used in the present study gives similar results with 1-hexene as comonomer, 246 R. Blom et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 237-249 however, there are some differences. At 368 K, we find the mean value of the gas phase based reactivity ratio kPHe/kp, to be 36(10) (see Table 6). Using our definition of the reactivity ratio, the earlier data on the Cr03/Si02 catalyst [5] gives a much lower value for the reactivity ratio kpB /kPE of 0.7. This discrepancy can partly be explained by the different comonomer used and partly by a different, not prereduced, catalyst used in [ 5 ] . As observed for butene as comonomer there is a significant decrease in molecular weight with increased hexene content in the reactor. The amount of double bonds other than vinyl is lower than 15% of the total amount of unsaturation in all cases. As Karol [ 5 ] observed, the amount of vinylidene increases with increased amount of 1-hexene, but we also see a steady increase in transvinylene content. This is shown in the Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. We also notice a slight increase in vinyl content with increased amount of hexene. The increase in vinyl content indicates that chain transfer to hexene is more rapid than chain transfer to ethylene.

Blom et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 237-249 247 termination reaction with /3-hydrogen transfer to monomer with hexene as the last inserted monomer. To produce a transvinylene fragment the last inserted hexene has reacted such that the butyl group ends up in the a-position after insertion (k' ssHeE In the kinetic scheme), while a vinylidene is produced if the hexene adds such that the butyl group ends up in the (3 position after insertion (kssHeE). The high frequency of chain transfer to ethylene with butyl in the ss-position can be explained by the high reactivity of the hydrogen at the tertiary carbon. The high frequency of chain transfer to ethylene with butyl in a-position can be explained by very slow further insertion due to steric hindrance. Observed transvinylene has earlier been suggested to result from isomerization [ 5 ] . However, this does not readily explain the increase by increased hexene content. If we assume steady state for the Cr\"-CHZ-CHBu-R fragment during the polymerization and at the same time assume that the propagation with ethylene (denoted as kpHeE In the kinetic scheme) dominates over the spontaneous (3-hydrogen elimination (kssHe) and the chain transfer to ethylene (kssH.E) reactions. We can then write the following equation: kpHeE' [Cr`-CHZ-CHBu-R] - [E] =kpHe' [Cr'-CHz-CH2-R] - [He] (7) An expression for [Cr*-CH2-CHBu-R] can then be written: [Cr'-CHZ-CHBu-R] -kpHeE [Cr'] [E]] (8) The rate of formation of vinylidene can be written: rvinylidene =kfil-IcE * [Cr'-CHZ-CHBu-R] [E] and using the expression for [Cr*-CHZ-CHBu-R] from Eq. 8: rvinylidene = kpHe - kQHeE [ C,ra ] [ He ] (9 ) kpHeE The rate of propagation: rp=kpE[Cr\"] [E] (10) An expression for the frequency of vinylidene can be obtained by dividing Eq. 9 by Eq. 10: rvinylidene = 2 X 10 3N kPl'IeE ' kpHe [ He ] Vinylidene - rp kpHeE ' kpE [ E ] By plotting the left hand side versus the hexene/ethylene gas phase molar ratio the ratio between the rate constants on the right hand side can be obtained at 368 K. A ratio kssHeEkpHe/ kpHeEkpE of 9.0 X 10-Z is obtained from linear regression of the 368 K data of Fig. 3. It was earlier shown that the reactivity ratio kpHe/kpE=36(10) at 368 K. By assuming that the major part of the hexene is 1,2 inserted this number can be used directly and we can obtain a value for the ratio kssHeE/kpHeE=2.5 X 10-3 at 368 K. The same procedure can be used for the transvinylene fragments: ] rtransvinylene = 2 X 103 No-ansvin lene = k QHeE -k kpHe [ He rp y kpHeE *kpE[E] 248 R.

An average ratio of ( k ',,eE ' kp'H e ) / ( kpllea ~ kpE) -1.8 X 10- 2 is obtained from linear regression of the data obtained at 368 K in Fig. 4. It would for the transvinylene case be speculative to make further assumptions to reduce this expression. In Fig. 5 the measured HLMI is shown at two different temperatures and with different ratios of 1-hexene/ethylene in the autoclave. HLMI increases slightly with addition of hexene. The different slope at the two temperatures indicate that the incorporation of hexene is more efficient at low temperature. 5. Conclusions (i) The ethylene pressure does not affect the number average molecular weight for the Cr/Si02 catalyst and the pressure range used in this study. This shows that spontaneous ss-hydrogen transfer is insignificant relative to ,6-hydrogen transfer to monomer. This is contrary to experience with Ziegler catalysts. ( ii) Adding 1-hexene ( in low concentration) gives decrease of number average molecular weight. The frequency of vinyl, vinylidene and transvinylene fragments increases with increased hexene/ethylene molar ratio in the reactor. This is ascribed to: ( iii) Vinyl increases slightly since ss-hydrogen transfer to hexene is faster than to ethylene. (iv) Vinylidene increases, because ss-hydrogen transfer to ethylene after insertion of hex ene is faster than after insertion of ethylene. Transvinylene increases (from zero with no hexene), because some of the hexene insertions are 2,1 insertions (abnormal insertions), after which further propagation is slow due to steric hindrance while ss-hydrogen transfer is still proceeding. (vi) The total polymerization and chain transfer reactions have been described quantitatively in a kinetic model and kinetic constants have been determined for the catalyst studied. R.

Homopolymerizations of ethylene have been performed with different partial pressures of ethylene (3.9–13.2 bar) and at different temperatures (334–371 K) with a prereduced chromium oxide on silica catalyst. Unlike Ziegler catalyst, the molecular weight of the polymer formed is not dependent on the ethylene pressure used during polymerization. An interpretation of this result is that chain termination by spontaneous β-elimination is not frequent at the chosen polymerization conditions, and that the predominant chain termination reaction is β-hydrogen transfer to monomer. On the other hand, the molecular weight is strongly dependent on the polymerization temperature. From experiments performed at different temperatures activation parameters have been estimated. From copolymerization experiments an estimate for the reactivity ratio between 1-hexene and ethylene has been calculated. The number of both vinyl and vinylidene fragments in the polymer increase with increased 1-hexene content in the reactor. The number of transvinylene fragments in the polymer is low, but this number also increases with increased 1-hexene content in the reactor.
