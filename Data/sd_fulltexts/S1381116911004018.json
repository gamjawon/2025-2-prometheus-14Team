Graphical abstract The catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic performance for selective oxidation of cyclohexane by molecular oxygen without solvent in a sealed autoclave reactor, due to the cooperative effect among the metalloporphyrin, organosilicon microsphere and ceria. Highlights ► Porphyrin is immobilized onto organosilicon microsphere by amide bond. ► Cooperative effect exists among metalloporphyrin, organosilicon microsphere and ceria. ► The support is the mixture of organosilicon microsphere and ceria. ► The catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic performance for oxidation of cyclohexane. ► The catalyst has a remarkable stability. In this study, cobalt tetraphenylporphyrin was immobilized through amide bond on organosilicon microsphere mixed with ceria. The catalysts were characterized and the catalytic performance was investigated. The results show that the catalysts are nanoparticles with average sizes of 30nm and organosilicon microsphere is mixed with ceria. In addition, the catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance for selective oxidation of cyclohexane by molecular oxygen without solvent in a sealed autoclave reactor, due to the cooperative effect among the metalloporphyrin, organosilicon microsphere and ceria. The conversion of cyclohexane and the selectivity of cyclohexanol+cyclohexanone reached 14.21% and 54.6%, respectively. After repeated reuse, the conversion of cyclohexane and the selectivity of cyclohexanol+cyclohexanone were still kept at about 13.1% and 61.9%, respectively. Keywords Organosilicon microsphere Metalloporphyrin Ceria Cooperative effect Cyclohexane 1 Introduction Metalloporphyrin with recognized catalytic activity has previously been employed in selective oxidation of cyclohexane, which is involved the manufacture of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone (KA oil) [1–3]. However, unsupported metalloporphyrin is easily degraded and difficult to reuse, which limits the practical application of metalloporphyrin in actual industrial processes. Immobilization of metalloporphyrin is known to lead to properties such as higher activity and larger resistance to degradation than their homogeneous counterparts [4–6]. Furthermore, immobilization of metalloporphyrin can enhance the selectivity, as well as the possibility for reuse [7,8]. The immobilization of metalloporphyrin onto supports such as polymeric compounds [9], synthetic molecular sieves [10], silica [11] and other solids [12–14] has been reported. Specifically, inexpensive inorganic supports, such as silica, are usually used as an anchor. For example, Milaeva et al. has reported that metalloporphyrin can be immobilized via coordinated bonding (i.e. anchored via axial ligation of metal centers) onto the surface of modified silica [15]. Ghiaci et al. has conducted further work on this phenomenon [16], by synthesizing anchored metalloporphyrin, which were grafted onto organofunctionalized silica gel through a covalent bond. However, compared with silica, organosilicon nanoparticles have some beneficial properties, such as ease of modification [17]. Additionally, the surface of organosilicon supports is hydrophobic [18], and can selectively absorb cyclohexane, toluene and other organic substrates. In catalytic oxidation of cyclohexane, the supports can improve adsorption of cyclohexane to catalytic centers and desorption of oxidation products, which can improve the overall catalytic performance. In addition, when metal oxides, such as FeO x , NiO x and CoO x etc., are used as the support, catalytic performance of metalloporphyrin catalysts can be enhanced. For example, Hitomi [19] reported the adsorption of manganese porphyrin on metal oxides such as TiO2, CaO and La2O3. They found catalysts achieved a higher activity for the epoxidation of styrene. Goubert-Renaudin [20] synthesized and characterized of carbon-supported transition metal oxide nanoparticles–cobalt porphyrin as catalysts for electroreduction of oxygen in acid. They also found that the metal oxides could enhance the activity of metalloporphyrin. A cobalt center incorporated in the macrocycle is necessary to the oxygen reduction reaction. In this study, ceria was mixed with organosilicon microsphere and used as supports. Ceria was chosen due to its popularity as an excellent candidate for oxidation reactions such as CO oxidation [21]. Metalloporphyrin was immobilized on the supports through amide bonds in order to cooperate with ceria and organosilicon microsphere to improve the catalytic performance. The immobilization of metalloporphyrin was characterized using a variety of techniques, such as BET, UV–vis, FT-IR, TEM and SEM. And the catalytic performance was measured for selective oxidation of cyclohexane to cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone. The results show immobilization of the metalloporphyrin catalyst onto organosilicon microsphere and the addition of ceria improves the catalytic performance, due to the cooperative effect among metalloporphyrin, organosilicon microsphere and ceria. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of catalysts 2.1.1 Synthesis of cobalt (II) 5-(4-carboxyphenyl)-10,15,20-triphenyl porphyrin (CoTPP) In accordance with literature [22], 200mL propanoic acid, 1.51g of benzaldehyde (AR, redistilled before use) and 2.08g of 4-carboxy benzaldehyde (AR, redistilled before use) were added into a three-neck flask and refluxed under stirring, then 1.36g of pyrrole (AR, redistilled before use) was dropped through a funnel. The mixture was kept at reflux for 30min under stirring. The product was cooled overnight, and then filtered, washed with water, and purified. 5-(4-carboxyphenyl)-10,15,20-triphenyl porphyrin was obtained. 0.50g of the obtained porphyrin was dissolved in 100mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and after the addition 2.54g of CoCl2·6H2O, the mixture was brought to reflux under stirring until the porphyrin was exhausted. After cooling overnight, the solution was filtered and washed repeatedly with hot water, and the product, denoted as CoTPP, was achieved. 2.1.2 Synthesis of organosilicon microsphere containing amino ligand mixed with ceria (OSMC) According to literature [23], organosilicon microsphere was synthesized as follows. 100mL deionized water, 2.0mL of 0.125mol/L NaOH aqueous solution, and 0.74g of benzethonium Chloride were loaded into a three-neck flask, after which the mixture of 9.00g methyl trimethoxy silane and 1.31g of 3-aminopropyl trimethoxy silane was added at room temperature. After refluxing under stirring for 5h, 1.50g of methoxy trimethylsilane was added dropwise and then kept at reflux under stirring for another 12h. The product was filtered and washed using 200mL of methanol and dried in air overnight. The obtained product was dispersed in toluene and 2.00g of hexamethyl disilazane was added, then again brought to reflux for 16h. After filtering, washing with 200mL methanol, and drying at 80°C, organosilicon microsphere containing amino ligands was obtained and denoted as OSMA. OSMC (meaning OSMA mixed with ceria) was prepared by repeating the entire procedure except that 0.10g of ceria (obtained according to reference [24]) was added and dispersed at the initial step. 2.1.3 Synthesis of CoTPSC and CoTPSA 0.05g of CoTPP, 3.50g of OSMC and 150mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) were added into a three-neck flask, then refluxed for 12h. After cooling, washing with deionized water, and filtering, dichloromethane was used to extract the sample in a soxhlet extractor until no color was seen in the extracted solution and denoted as CoTPSC. The loading of CoTPP was 9.6mg/g-cat and the surface area of CoTPSC was 404m2/g. Similarly, when CoTPP was immobilized in OSMA by using the above method, the product was designated CoTPSA. 2.2 Measurement of catalytic performance Oxidation of cyclohexane without solvent was conducted in a 25mL autoclave reactor with a magnetic stirrer. Catalysts (60mg or 10mg) and cyclohexane (3.00g) were added first and, after sealing, then heated to 150°C under stirring. Molecular oxygen was then pumped into the autoclave until the system pressure was 2.0MPa. After 3.0h, the reactor was cooled to ambient temperature. The catalysts were removed by filtration, washed by ethanol and then dried at 75°C for reuse. The product was analyzed by gas chromatography with the internal standard method using chlorobenzene as the standard substance. 2.3 Characterization of catalysts UV–vis spectra were determined using a Shimadzu UV-2450 UV–vis spectrophotometer with BaSO4 as the reference and detection ranges of 200–800nm with a scan step of 0.5nm. FT-IR spectras were collected on an Agilent Perkin-Elmer 783 infrared spectrometer in KBr plates. The specific surface areas of samples were determined by analyzing the results of nitrogen sorption at 77K in a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 apparatus and applying the Brunaumer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. All samples were dehydrated at 150°C for 24h prior to nitrogen adsorption. SEM (JSM 6700F) was used to observe the particle sizes and shapes of samples. Prior to the measurements, the samples were mounted on a carrier prepared from glassy carbon and coated with a film of gold. TEM (Hitachi 800, operated at 175kV) images were obtained by dispersing samples by ultrasonication in ethanol and then pouring the solution into a holey copper grid. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of catalysts The FT-IR spectra of CoTPSC and OSMC are given in Fig. 1 . The absorption bands observed at 1040–1260cm−1 are due to the O–H groups on the silanol and Si–O–Si stretching vibrations. The bands observed at 1274cm−1 and 1413cm−1 can be ascribed to the C–H stretches of silane. For CoTPSC, new absorption bands appear at 1690–1630cm−1 due to the CO bonds in the amide groups (N–C=O) [25]. In addition, the characteristic bands of N–H shift from 1590cm−1 to 1530cm−1, likely due to the influence of the CO bonds. These findings verify that CoTPP has been immobilized onto OSMC through amide bond. As shown in Fig. 2 , the characteristic bands of porphyrin ring (e.g., Soret band) in the UV–vis spectra can be found at 432nm and 541nm [26], which indicate that the structure of porphyrin ring exists and suggest that CoTPP must be immobilized onto OSMC. In addition, it can also be seen that the characteristic peaks of porphyrin, as for CoTPSC, remains unchanged even after being reused up to 6 times. This means that the porphyrin still keeps its structure. However, as for the reused sample, the surface area of characteristic peak seems to become smaller than that of the fresh sample. Because the surface area of the characteristic peak is directly correlated with the amount of supported porphyrin, it suggests that some of the metalloporphyrin ring on the support should be degraded or lost. Overall, the stability and possible reuse of CoTPP is greatly improved by immobilization onto supports [14,15]. Fig. 3(a) and (b) shows the SEM images of CoTPSC and OSMC, which depict the distribution and morphology of particles. In Fig. 3 (a) and (b), both CoTPSC and OSMC reveal regular microsphere with particle sizes of around 30nm. However, compared with OSMC, CoTPSC grows a little larger. Thus there is some influence on the distribution and morphology of particles during the immobilization of CoTPP. As shown as Fig. 3(d), ceria cannot be found in the bulk of OSMC. Nevertheless, in Fig. 3(c), it was observed that ceria existed in clusters. Therefore, ceria is not doped in organosilicon microsphere but mixed with it in nano sizes. 3.2 Catalytic performance of catalysts for selective oxidation of cyclohexane The results in Table 1 show that CoTPSC, compared with homogeneous counterparts and other solids, is an efficient catalyst for selective oxidation of cyclohexane by molecular oxygen in a sealed autoclave reactor with a magnetic stirrer. For example, it can be seen that conversion of cyclohexane in the autocatalysis system or over OSMC is lower than 5.00%. And conversion of cyclohexane and selectivity of cyclohexanol+cyclohexanone over the homogeneous catalyst, i.e. CoTPP, are 7.55% and 71.4%, respectively. The turnover number of CoTPP is 193. Although conversion of cyclohexane and selectivity of cyclohexanol+cyclohexanone over CoTPSA are only 6.84% and 72.7%, the turnover number is 2966, much higher than that of CoTPP. When mixed with ceria (i.e. OSMA modified to OSMC), CoTPSC exhibits much higher catalytic performance for the oxidation of cyclohexane by molecular oxygen in a sealed autoclave reactor. For example, compared to other catalysts such as CoTPSA and CoTPP, CoTPSC shows the highest catalytic activity and turnover number (14.21% and 6162, respectively). Obviously, the mixing of ceria has a beneficial influence on improvement of the catalytic performance of CoTPSC, which has been generally attributed to the cooperative effect among metalloporphyrin, organosilicon microsphere and ceria [19,20]. It is well-known that ceria can enhance the catalytic activity of catalysts in some reactions [27,28]. Nevertheless, the selectivity of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone over CoTPSC is only 54.6%, lower than that of the others. It has been previously reported that there is a converse relationship between the catalytic activity and selectivity for selective oxidation of cyclohexane [29]. This phenomenon is ascribed to oxidation of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone in the vicinity of active catalytic species in a second oxidation cycle [15]. When the concentration of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone in the vicinity of the catalytic species increase, these products become new substrates for a further oxidation reaction, which might cause the decrease in selectivity. In order to further study selective oxidation of cyclohexane, influence of reaction time on the catalytic performance of CoTPSC has been investigated. As shown in Fig. 4 , conversion of cyclohexane over CoTPSC increases with time for the initial 3h. As the reaction goes on, conversion of cyclohexane is kept at about 14.0%. However, selectivity of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone increases at first, and reaches 77.7% at 1.5h, then gradually decreases to a value of only 40.0% at 6.0h. The phenomenon during the initial 1.5h seems not to obey the proved relationship between conversion of cyclohexane and selectivity of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone as mentioned above. This is attributed to appearance of cyclohexyl hydroperoxide during the initial stage of cyclohexane oxidation and which are then transfers to cyclohexanol or cyclohexanone [30]. However, cyclohexyl hydroperoxide cannot be detected by GC and must be analyzed by chemical titration. From Fig. 4, it can be seen that the selectivity of cyclohexyl hydroperoxide is 44.6% during the first hour and decreased to 3.7% at the third hour. Considering the influence of cyclohexyl hydroperoxide, cyclohexane oxidation over CoTPSC during the first 1.5h still obeys the proved relationship between the conversion of cyclohexane and the selectivity of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone. 3.3 Stability of catalysts for selective oxidation of cyclohexane Supported metalloporphyrins has the advantage of possible reuse [13]. Therefore, CoTPSC was separated by filtration and washed by ethanol after the first use. The obtained catalysts were reused after being dried in air. Fig. 5 displays the stability and possible reuse of CoTPSC for selective oxidation of cyclohexane. At first-run, the conversion of cyclohexane reached 14.8%, and the selectivity of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone is 53.6%. After being reused up to 6 times, the catalytic performance of CoTPSC has only slightly decreased. Namely, the conversion of cyclohexane is 13.1%. However, the selectivity of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone increases to 59.9%. As shown in Fig. 2, the characteristic bands of porphyrin are still observed in the reused as well as the fresh samples. Thus, this decrease is attributed to a possible deactivation or loss of part active catalytic species [5]. 4 Conclusions In conclusion, a novel catalyst, CoTPSC, was synthesized by immobilizing CoTPP onto supports (OSMC) through amide bond. The catalyst has a particle size of 30nm and an excellent catalytic performance for selective oxidation of cyclohexane by dioxygen without solvent in a sealed autoclave reactor, because of cooperative effect among metalloporphyrin, organosilicon microsphere and ceria. Namely, the conversion of cyclohexane and the selectivity of cyclohexanol+cyclohexanone over CoTPSC reached 14.21% and 54.6%, respectively. CoTPSC also exhibited good stability. After repeated reuse, the conversion of cyclohexane and the selectivity of cyclohexanol+cyclohexanone over CoTPSC were still kept at about 13.1% and 61.9%, respectively.
