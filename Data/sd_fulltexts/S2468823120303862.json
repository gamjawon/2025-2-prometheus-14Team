Materials Science and Chemical Engineering Department Stony Brook University Stony Brook NY 11794 USA Graphical abstract During the catalyst synthesis process, the precursor chosen could have great impact on the physiochemical and surface properties of the catalysts. More importantly, the precursor could result in very different catalytic activities of the catalyst. In this work, two series of FeOx/CeO2 catalysts were prepared using iron nitrate/sulfate precursors with a wide range of Fe loading (1 wt% – 30 wt%). The catalytic activity, physical property, surface morphology and surface/molecular structure were investigated using GC, BET, XRD, Raman, FT-IR as well as SEM and EDS techniques. From the results, although the physical properties (specific surface area, total pore volume) of the catalyst were similar with different precursors, the surface composition and molecular structures were very different. The iron nitrate precursor fully transformed into FeOx after the calcination process, whereas the iron sulfate precursor only partially transformed into FeOx, leaving some FeSO4 on the catalyst surface. The catalytic activity results suggested that a near monolayer coverage of FeOx on the catalyst surface was crucial to increase the catalytic activity in the NO reduction by CO reaction, while the presence of FeSO4 had advert impacts on the catalytic activity. Keywords NO reduction by CO Iron oxide Ceria Precursor effects 1 Introduction Removal of nitrogen oxides (NOx) produced from combustion processes continues to be a major thrust area in heterogeneous catalysis. In the past few decades, supported metal and metal oxide catalysts have been utilized to catalytically reduce NOx gases with the help of reducing agents such as hydrogen [1–4], and carbon monoxide (CO) [5–9]. The catalytic reduction of NO by CO is a particularly attractive reaction since NO and CO are both present in the automotive exhaust and could be eliminated at the same time with this reaction. In general, supported metal oxide catalysts relied on precious noble metals such as Pt and Rh [10,11]. Due to the high cost and scarcity of precious metals, catalyst systems containing earth-abundant metals and their oxides have garnered increasing attention. Transition metal oxide catalysts are advantageous because of lower costs, higher thermal stability, and competitive catalytic activities, especially for the NO reduction by CO reaction [12–14]. Ceria – iron oxide catalyst systems have been studied in several catalysis procedures including NO reduction by H2 and NH3 selective catalytic reduction (NH3-SCR) and have shown great potential [15,16]. Recently, Peck et al. [17] studied FeOx/CeO2 and CoOx/CeO2 catalysts for NO reduction by CO reaction in the presence of O2. Although the authors found that FeOx/CeO2 catalysts generally showed lower areal activity comparing to CoOx/CeO2 catalysts, the dispersion of the surface FeOx was better than CoOx. Zhang et al. [18] investigated CuO supported by CeO2-Fe2O3 catalysts for NO reduction by CO and found that the addition of Fe3+ to CeO2 had positive impacts on NO conversion, as there was a strong interaction between Fe2O3 and CeO2. Precursors used during the catalyst synthesis process are found to have an impact on the crystallinity, surface area, morphology, and catalytic activity. For example, Juárez-Marmolejo et al. [19] compared Fe and Co precursors (nitrate/chloride) and their effects on the structure of carbon supported PdFe and PdCo catalysts. The authors found that nitrate precursors facilitated the metal oxide formation more than the chloride precursors, which led to a better catalytic performance for the formic acid oxidation reaction. Xiong et al. [20] compared the catalytic activities of carbon spheres supported iron catalysts in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis using nitrate or acetate iron precursors. The authors reported that the catalyst made from iron acetate precursor had lower surface area than that of nitrate precursor (9.2 m2/g vs 21.4 m2/g) and more uniform iron particles. It was also reported that iron acetate precursor derived supported iron catalyst showed better performance (in terms of metal time yield) than that of iron nitrate derived one. Wang et al. [21] found that, instead of using iron nitrate precursor, the use of ammonium ferric citrate in PtFe/C catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction could facilitate a larger amount of PtFe alloy, which resulted in a higher activity (23 % increase). In other cases, different precursor did not affect the catalytic activity much. Cherian et al. [22] found that using an ammonium dichromate precursor for the synthesis of Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts resulted in a lower surface area, compared to the catalysts using the chromium nitrate precursors. However, the catalysts prepared from both precursors showed similar catalytic activities in propane ODH reaction. Although several and series of CeO2 supported MOx (M = metal) catalysts have been studied for the NO reduction by CO reaction, detailed studies of precursor effect on the catalytic activity and physicochemical properties are still lacking. Herein we report the effect of nitrate and sulfate iron oxide precursors, as well as the Fe loading on the overall catalytic activity of NO reduction by CO. Two series of FeOx/CeO2 catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) on CeO2 with different precursors. The effects of iron precursors on the structures and catalytic performances of FeOx/CeO2 catalysts were investigated by BET, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, FT-IR, SEM and EDS, as well as gas phase NO reduction by CO reaction. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Catalyst synthesis Two series of ceria supported iron oxide catalysts were synthesized using incipient wetness impregnation method. Two precursors, iron (III) nitrate and iron (II) sulfate, were impregnated on the same supporting material (CeO2, HSA5 from Rhodia) during the synthesis process. The precursor was first dissolved in de-ionized water completely, then the prepared solution was added to the CeO2 powder slowly with the mixture constantly being stirred. After impregnation, the samples were dried under ambient conditions for 12 h. The samples were transported to a tube furnace (Thermo Scientific Lindberg Blue Mini-Mite Tube Furnace, Model TF55030A-1) and further dried in flowing air (100 mL/min, dry grade, Airgas) at 120 °C for 12 h. The ramping rate from room temperature to 120 °C was 2 °C/min. After fully removing moisture from the catalyst, the catalyst was subsequently calcined in flowing air (100 mL/min, dry grade, Airgas) at 400 °C for 6 h. The ramping rate from 120 °C to 400 °C was 5 °C/min. Finally, the calcined catalyst was sieved using a 425 μm size sieve (Fisherbrand). The prepared catalysts were detonated as x% FeOx/CeO2 (N/S), with x being the calculated wt% of Fe, and N/S indicating the precursor used during the synthesis process (N-nitrate, S-sulfate). 2.2 Gas phase catalytic activity measurements The gas phase catalytic activity of the synthesized FeOx/CeO2 catalysts in NO reduction by CO reaction was investigated using a gas phase reaction setup. The catalyst (∼40 mg) was put in a fixed bed quartz reactor (7.6 mm inner diameter, 2 mm wall thickness, 24.4 cm length, Quartz Scientific). The reaction gas was made up by 5% NO with He balance and 5% CO with He balance with a total flow rate of 40 mL/min. The flow rates were controlled manually with needle valves and monitored by mass flow meters (FMA-1700 series, Omega) and the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was 31,200 h−1. Reaction temperature range was 25 °C–500 °C and the temperature was controlled by temperature control systems (ATS). Catalysts were treated at 400 °C in He atmosphere for 1 h before the activity test. The gas phase reaction products were detected and analyzed with GC equipped with a TCD detector (Trace 1300 GC from Thermo Scientific). 2.3 Catalyst characterization The N2 isotherm, multi-point BET surface area, BJH pore size distribution as well as pore properties (average pore size and total pore volume) of the FeOx/CeO2 catalysts were measured and calculated by NOVA 2200 series analyzer from Quantachrome. Before the test, ∼0.1 g of the catalyst samples were held at 300 °C for 4 h to remove water and impurities under vacuum condition. During the analysis, the catalyst samples were placed in liquid nitrogen (−196 °C). Crystallite structures of the calcined CeO2 and FeOx/CeO2 catalysts were explored by XRD technique. The XRD patterns were collected with a Phillips PW1729/APD3520 diffractometer with Cu radiation (λ = 1.54184 Å) in the 2θ range of 20−80° with a step size of 0.02°. Molecular structures of the FeOx/CeO2 catalysts were probed using Raman spectroscopy (XploRa PLUS, Horiba). The Raman spectra were collected under ambient temperature and pressure conditions with 785 nm laser. The Raman shift was calibrated with standard silicon wafer sample. The spectral acquisition times were 10 scans accumulated at 20 s/scan. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained with Perkin-Elmer Frontier IR spectrometer using an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) mode. The IR spectrum was collected with a 4 cm−1 resolution and an accumulation of 32 scans. The surface topography and content were probed by SEM and EDS techniques, respectively. The SEM images were taken with LEO 1550 SFEG SEM (Zeiss) with a EDS detector from EDAX, and software/electronics from iXRFsystems. The samples were coated with nominally 6 nm of Au to reduce charging. Additionally, the samples were imaged using a Robinson backscatter detector (RBSD) and 20KeV electrons. 3 Results 3.1 Gas-phase catalytic activity of FeOx/CeO2 catalysts for NO reduction by CO The gas phase catalytic activity results of the two series of FeOx/CeO2 (N and S) are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 , respectively. Overall, as the reaction temperature increased from 25 °C to 500 °C, for both FeOx/CeO2 (N) and FeOx/CeO2 (S) series of catalysts, the NO and CO conversions increased as well. However, with the same surface Fe wt% and reaction temperatures, the FeOx/CeO2 (N) catalysts showed higher NO or CO conversion values than their FeOx/CeO2 (S) counterparts, especially at medium reaction temperature ranges (200 °C – 400 °C). For example, at 250 °C, the 5% FeOx/CeO2 (N) catalyst converted >90 % of NO whereas the 5% FeOx/CeO2 (S) catalyst displayed negligible NO conversion. At 500 °C, on the other hand, all of the tested catalysts, regardless of precursors, showed high NO and CO conversions (both >90 %), except for bulk FeOx (S), which displayed no catalytic activity throughout the tested reaction temperature range (25 °C – 500 °C). Also, for the FeOx/CeO2 (N) catalysts, the supported catalysts performed better than both bulk FeOx (N) and bulk CeO2, especially under lower reaction temperatures. But for FeOx/CeO2 (S) catalysts, 1% and 5% FeOx/CeO2 (S) catalysts showed higher NO and CO conversions than bulk CeO2. This result indicates that the surface structure/composition of the two series of FeOx/CeO2 catalysts might be different, resulting in different synergy effects as well as vastly different catalytic activity results under the same reaction conditions. Moreover, comparing the catalysts made with iron nitrate precursor, it could be noticed that, as the Fe loading increased from 1% to 5%, the overall catalytic activity also improved. For instance, at 200 °C and 250 °C, the NO conversion increased from ∼30 % to ∼55 % and from ∼80 % to ∼95 %, respectively. However, as the surface Fe content continue to increase from 5% to 30 %, the NO and CO conversion did not follow the same trend but stayed the same (or worse) instead. This could possibly be explained by the effects of surface Fe dispersion. It has been reported that after the surface metal oxides (e.g., CoOx and FeOx) reach monolayer coverage, the catalytic activity does not further increase even with higher surface metal oxide loadings, as discussed by Peck et al. and our previous work [17,23]. In the case of FeOx/CeO2 (S) series of catalysts, NO and CO conversion decreased continuously with increasing surface Fe loadings up to 10 wt%, while both 10 wt% and 30 wt% samples showed similar results. This could be caused by the formation and accumulation of inactive surface species on the catalyst. Detailed surface characterization using Raman, XRD and FT-IR will be discussed in later sections. In addition to NO and CO conversion, the N2 and N2O selectivity under each reaction temperature were also evaluated. As shown in Fig. 1 (c–d) and Fig. 2(c–d), as the reaction temperature increased, the N2 (N2O) selectivity increased (decreased) monotonically in sync with the reaction temperatures. This could be explained with the well-accepted two-step reaction process for the NO reduction by CO reaction over supported transition metal oxide catalysts [24–26]. In the first step of the reaction, especially when the reaction temperature is lower, NO and CO are converted into mainly N2O and CO2. (Eq. 1) As reaction temperature increased, the formed N2O started interacting with CO and decompose into N2 and convert CO into more CO2 at the same time. (Eq. 2) (1) (Step 1) 2 N O + C O → N 2 O + C O 2 (2) (Step 2) N 2 O + C O → N 2 + C O 2 (4) (Overall reaction) 2 N O + 2 C O → N 2 + 2 C O 2 It can be noticed that during the first step of the reaction, the NO:CO ratio is 2:1 instead of the 1:1 ratio if considering the overall reaction (Eq. 3). This resulted in the different NO and CO conversion shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b) under lower reaction temperatures. For example, the 5% FeOx/CeO2 (N) sample showed ∼55 % NO conversion at 200 °C, and the corresponding CO conversion is ∼25 %. Whereas at higher reaction temperatures (i.e. 350 °C), both NO and CO conversions are ∼100 %. Similar phenomenon could be observed in the FeOx/CeO2 (S) cases as well. As shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), at 250 °C, the 1% FeOx/CeO2 (S) sample showed ∼55 % NO conversion and ∼28 % CO conversion. At 350 °C, the corresponding NO and CO conversions are both ∼80 %. 3.2 Physical properties of FeOx/CeO2 To better understand the structure-activity relationship of FeOx/CeO2 catalysts in NO reduction by CO reaction and explain the vastly different trend displayed in the catalytic activity results using the two series of FeOx/CeO2 catalysts, physical properties of the FeOx/CeO2 catalysts were investigated using N2 isotherm, BET and BJH methods. The specific surface area and the total pore volume of the FeOx/CeO2 catalysts decreased with increasing Fe loading, regardless of the type of precursors. (Fig. 3 and Table S1) The decrease in specific surface area and total pore volume could be due to the accumulation and agglomeration of surface FeOx species, especially with high surface FeOx content (>10 wt%), as well as the blocking of the pores on the catalyst surface. It was reported that the surface density of monolayer coverage of surface FeOx in FeOx/CeO2 (N) catalyst system is around 7.5 Fe/nm2 [17]. In the current work, the surface density values of 10 wt% and 30 wt% FeOx/CeO2 (N) catalysts were 6.7 Fe/nm2 and 32.3 Fe/nm2, and the surface density values of 10 wt% and 30 wt% FeOx/CeO2 (S) catalysts were 7.7 Fe/nm2 and 53 Fe/nm2, as shown in Table S1. Therefore, the steep decrease in specific surface area from 10 % FeOx/CeO2 to 30 % FeOx/CeO2 catalyst is likely due to the formation of crystalline structures of FeOx (or bulk like Fe2O3), which has very low specific surface area of ∼25 m2/g in both nitrate and sulfate precursor cases. Fig. 4 shows the N2 isotherm curve of bulk CeO2, FeOx/CeO2 (N and S), and bulk FeOx. The bulk CeO2 displayed typical type-IV N2 isotherm patterns, indicating the presence of mesoporous structures. In the case of FeOx/CeO2 (N and S) catalysts, the N2 isotherm patterns were very similar to that of bulk CeO2, while 30 % FeOx/CeO2 sample showed a little different type IV pattern. The 30 % FeOx/CeO2 samples displayed H4 hysteresis loop patterns rather than the H1 hysteresis loop patterns, which were observed in 1∼10 % FeOx/CeO2 samples. This result indicated that for FeOx/CeO2 samples with lower Fe contents, the pore size of the catalyst should be narrowly distributed [27]. (Figure S1) In the case of 30 % FeOx/CeO2 sample, the H4 hysteresis loop is associated with slit-like pores and a less well-defined pore size distribution profile. The bulk FeOx (N) and bulk FeOx (S) both showed type IV isotherm as well, with a H4 hysteresis loop similar to 30 % FeOx/CeO2 catalysts, suggesting that the bulk FeOx (N/S) also had narrow slit-like pore structures as well as a broad pore size distribution as shown in Figure S1. 3.3 Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) One of the major factors that could affect the catalytic activity is molecular structure of the catalyst. The crystalline structures of the FeOx/CeO2 catalysts in addition to bulk CeO2 and Fe2O3 as references were investigated using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique (Fig. 5 ). Note that the XRD pattern of the aluminum sample holder was also included in the figure, as some of peaks observed in the FeOx/CeO2 catalysts were from the sample holder, rather than the catalysts. For both FeOx/CeO2 (N) and FeOx/CeO2 (S) catalysts, all the tested samples displayed strong fluorite CeO2 patterns (FCC structure, PDF# 97−002-8709) at 28.6°, 33.0°, 47.3°, and 56.2°, which are related to the (111), (200), (220), and (311) reflections in fluorite CeO2, respectively. Furthermore, the positions of CeO2 characteristic diffraction peaks on the FeOx/CeO2 XRD patterns were not shifted (Table S1). This result suggested that the fluorite cubic structure of CeO2 in the FeOx/CeO2 catalysts was not changed. For the 30 % FeOx/CeO2 (N) sample, new peaks were also observed at 33.1°, 35.5°, 54.1°, 62.5°, and 63.9°, which are attributed to the (104), (110), (116), (214) and (300) reflections from the α-Fe2O3 structure, respectively (PDF# 00−033-0664) [28–30]. As for the 33.1° peak, it is difficult to distinguish solely from the XRD patterns since both α-Fe2O3 and CeO2 have peak at ∼33.0°. It is worthwhile to note that most FeOx characteristic peaks were not observed up to 10 % FeOx/CeO2 (N) samples, possibly because the surface FeOx species were relatively well dispersed on CeO2 rather than forming crystalline α-Fe2O3 structures. The XRD pattern of FeOx/CeO2 (S) catalysts showed similar to that of the bulk CeO2, while 30 % FeOx/CeO2 (S) sample’s diffraction peaks were weak and broad. (Fig. 5 (b)) Weak intensity peak at 35.5° was observed with 30 % FeOx/CeO2 (S) sample, but the shape of the peak was not as sharp comparing to 30 % FeOx/CeO2 (N). For bulk FeOx (S) sample, sharp and high intensity peak was observed ∼27.5°, which corresponded to the FeSO4 structures, in addition to the typical α-Fe2O3 peaks [31]. Note that the FeSO4 peak was not observed on a series of FeOx/CeO2 (S) samples’ XRD patterns. From the XRD results, it could be concluded that crystalline α-Fe2O3 structures were possibly formed in very high Fe loading (30 wt%) FeOx/CeO2 catalysts over the studied samples. However, we cannot fully ignore the presence of crystalline structure of FeOx with < 30 wt% samples due to the limitation in detection range of lab-scale powder XRD. 3.4 Raman and FT-IR spectroscopy To further investigate the detailed surface structure and dispersion of the FeOx, Raman spectroscopy was applied since it is more sensitive to nanocrystalline metal oxide structures on the catalyst surface. The Raman spectra of the series of FeOx/CeO2 (N) and FeOx/CeO2 (S) catalysts were shown in Fig. 6 (a) and (b), respectively. The bulk CeO2 sample displayed peaks at ∼250 cm−1 (weak), ∼458 cm−1 (strong) and ∼597 cm−1 (weak), which are attributed to the second-order transverse acoustic mode, F2g vibration of Ce-O bond, and d-band vibrations in CeO2, respectively [32–34]. It is worth pointing out that the ∼597 cm−1 peak from CeO2 was also believed to related to the defect sites in CeO2 lattice [35]. For the FeOx/CeO2 (N) catalysts, starting from 10 % FeOx/CeO2 (N) catalyst, two new peaks at ∼218 cm−1 and ∼282 cm−1 were observed. (Fig. 6(a)) The ∼218 cm−1 peak is due to the A1g vibration in Fe2O3 structures whereas the ∼282 cm−1 peak is assigned to the Eg vibration in Fe2O3, indicating that the surface Fe2O3 nanocrystalline structures started to form when the surface Fe content reached ∼10 wt%. [36,37]. In the case of 30 % FeOx/CeO2 (N) catalyst, two more peaks were observed in the spectrum at ∼400 cm−1 and ∼600 cm−1, which are assigned to the Eg vibration in Fe2O3 structures [36]. Note that the ∼218 cm−1 and ∼282 cm-1 peaks in the 30 % FeOx/CeO2 (N) catalyst spectrum is much stronger than these of 10 % FeOx/CeO2 (N) catalyst. The results indicate that as the surface Fe content kept increasing from 10 % to 30 %, the size of the surface Fe2O3 crystalline structure became larger with increasing ordered state. Fig. 6(b) shows the bulk FeOx (S) and a series of FeOx/CeO2 (S) catalysts’ Raman spectra. Similar to the FeOx/CeO2 (N) samples’ Raman spectra, the FeOx/CeO2 (S) spectra contained the CeO2 (F2g mode) peak at ∼458 cm−1 and peak intensity was decreased with increasing Fe loadings. The 30 % FeOx/CeO2 (S) catalyst showed Fe2O3 peaks at ∼222 cm−1, ∼290 cm−1, ∼405 cm−1, and ∼612 cm−1, in addition to the very weak intensity CeO2 peak, while Fe2O3 peaks were not present up to 10 % FeOx/CeO2 (S) spectra. It was noticed that the Fe2O3 peaks positions in 30 % FeOx/CeO2 (S) catalyst shifted to higher wavenumber comparing to 30 % FeOx/CeO2 (N) catalyst. The peak shifting could be due to the formation of multiple surface Fe species (e.g. Fe2O3 and FeSO4) or other effects like photon confinement [38,39]. The 30 % FeOx/CeO2 (S) Raman spectrum also showed a weak peak at ∼646 cm−1 and this could be due to the presence of FeSO4 [40]. In the case of bulk FeOx (S) sample, two sharp peaks were observed at ∼183 cm−1 and ∼230 cm−1, which are also assigned to FeSO4 [40]. Based on the Raman results, it could be speculated that, for the FeOx/CeO2 (N) catalysts, the surface Fe2O3 started forming nanocrystalline structures at 10 wt% and monolayer coverage is < 10 wt%. On the other hand, the FeOx/CeO2 (S) catalysts contain both Fe2O3 and FeSO4 structure at 30 wt% and monolayer coverage is > 10 wt%. In addition to Raman spectroscopy, the IR spectra of the samples were also collected to further investigate the molecular structures of the catalysts. The FT-IR ATR results are shown in Figure S2. For the FeOx/CeO2 (N) catalysts, no obvious difference in spectra was observed up to 10 % FeOx/CeO2 (N), while the 30 % FeOx/CeO2 (N) catalyst showed signature bands of Fe2O3 at ∼450 cm−1 and ∼550 cm−1, corresponding to the Fe-O stretching vibrations [41,42]. This result agrees with the previous XRD and Raman results, where the evidence of Fe2O3 crystalline structures existed in the 30 % FeOx/CeO2 (N) catalyst. It should be noted that Raman spectroscopy provided the presence of Fe2O3 at 10 % FeOx/CeO2 (N) catalyst as shown in Fig. 6(a). For the FeOx/CeO2 (S) catalysts, Fe2O3 bands (∼450 cm−1 and ∼550 cm−1) and FeSO4 band (∼1120 cm−1) [43] were found in the 30 % FeOx/CeO2 (S) catalyst and this result is well matched to the Raman spectroscopy result. Using the FTIR spectroscopy, the evidence of FeSO4 in a series of FeOx/CeO2 (S) samples, however, was observed starting from 1% FeOx/CeO2 (S) catalyst. Considering the catalytic activity results over the FeOx/CeO2 (S) catalysts, it was observed that as the Fe loading increased, the catalytic activity decreased. Based on the FTIR results, the decrease in catalytic activity might be due to the presence of FeSO4 because sulfur is well known as a catalyst poison and could have significantly negative impacts on catalytic activity [44,45]. 3.5 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy (EDS) To further confirm the surface morphology and the presence of sulfur on the surface of the FeOx/CeO2 (S) catalysts, SEM images were taken, and EDS analyses were applied. As shown in Fig. 7 , with increasing the Fe loading from 1% to 30 %, surface texture was slowly changed from smooth to rough. Especially, the 30 % FeOx/CeO2 (S) catalyst’s SEM image shows agglomerated FeOx (and Fe3O4) species as well as bumpy surface. On the other hand. the FeOx/CeO2 (S) catalysts with lower Fe loading show relatively clean surface and surface FeOx species looks well dispersed on the CeO2 surface. In the case of the FeOx/CeO2 (N) catalysts, similar to the FeOx/CeO2 (S) catalysts, an increased surface roughness could be observed in the SEM images as the Fe loading increased (Figure S3). In the image of 30 % FeOx/CeO2 (N) catalyst, larger crystalline structures could be noticed, while 10 % FeOx/CeO2 (N) catalyst shows small but noticeable surface species. The surface species could be mixed FeOx and Fe2O3 species based on the XRD and Raman results. From the EDS results (below the SEM images), Ce, Fe, and S elements could be identified. It should be noted that the Au element was from the sample preparation process for SEM imaging, where gold coating was applied to the sample surface to improve the quality of the SEM images. Also, from Figure S4 and Figure S5, it can be noticed that the EDS results of the FeOx/CeO2 catalysts are similar even with different magnification powers, indicating an even distribution of the surface FeOx species. From the previous Raman and IR results, FeSO4 was found in the FeOx/CeO2 (S) catalysts. For instance, in IR results (Figure S2), the FeSO4 bands were noticed starting from 1% FeOx/CeO2 (S). According to the EDS results, similar trend was observed. The existence of sulfur was confirmed in 1% FeOx/CeO2 (S) as well and sulfur was identified in all the tested FeOx/CeO2 (S) catalysts. For the FeOx/CeO2 (N) catalysts, the SEM images and EDS results were shown in Figure S3. Ce, Fe, and Au elements were observed. 4 Discussion The precursors used during the catalyst synthesis process can have great impacts on the surface/molecular structures of the catalyst, and further resulting in improved or worsened catalytic activities. In this study, multiple spectroscopic and microscopic techniques were applied to understand the iron precursor effects on the structure-activity relationship of the FeOx/CeO2 catalysts. In the FeOx/CeO2 (N) series of catalysts, as the Fe loading increased from 1% to 30 %, a monotonic decrease in specific surface area of the samples were observed (Fig. 3 and Table S1). The total pore volume of the catalysts also slightly decreased with the increasing Fe loading, possibly due to the blocking of the existing pores on the CeO2 surface. Similar trend was observed for the FeOx/CeO2 (S) catalysts. However, the specific surface area and total pore volume decrease were steeper than their nitrate precursor counterpart at higher Fe loading samples (>10 %). For example, the 30 % FeOx/CeO2 (N) catalyst had specific surface area of 100 m2/g whereas the 30 % FeOx/CeO2 (S) catalyst only had specific area of 61 m2/g. The larger drop in specific surface area could be from the presence of both Fe2O3 and FeSO4. With increased Fe loading on the catalyst surface, the dispersion and molecular structure of the surface FeOx were expected to change from isolated species to monolayer coverage of FeOx, then to the formation of large crystalline FeOx structures. This speculation was then confirmed by spectroscopic results. XRD patterns of the FeOx/CeO2 (N) catalysts (Fig. 5) indicated that Fe2O3 crystalline structures were formed in the 30 % FeOx/CeO2 (N) catalyst. Raman results (Fig. 6), having better resolution on smaller structures, confirmed that the Fe2O3 nanocrystalline structures started to emerge in the 10 % FeOx/CeO2 (N) catalyst. Based on previous literature [17,23], Raman spectroscopy could be used as a tool for surface metal oxide monolayer coverage detection. Therefore, it could be speculated that the 10 % FeOx/CeO2 (N) is above (or around) the monolayer coverage region. For the FeOx/CeO2 (S) catalysts, the 30 % FeOx/CeO2 (S) showed a peak of Fe2O3 in XRD results as well as the two signature peaks of Fe2O3 in its Raman and IR spectra. Based on the XRD and Raman spectroscopic results, it can be deduced that the monolayer coverage range is > 10 % for FeOx/CeO2 (S) catalyst. This result provides that dispersibility of FeOx on FeOx/CeO2 (S) could be higher than that of FeOx/CeO2 (N). It has been reported that the better dispersion of surface metal oxide can improve the catalytic performances [46–48]. However, the nitrate and sulfate precursor effect on the molecular structure and catalytic activity in this study were not fully followed the general high-dispersion/high-activity relationship due to the sulfur residues. As shown in XRD (Fig. 5(b)), Raman (Fig. 6(b)), FTIR (Figure S2(b)), and EDS (Fig. 7), FeSO4 was present in a series of FeOx/CeO2 (S) catalysts. The presence of FeSO4 could be explained by the high thermal decomposition temperature (>600 °C) [49], while the calcination temperature used in this study was 400 °C. It is worthwhile to note that Fe2O3 species was also identified in the 30 % FeOx/CeO2 (S) catalyst from XRD, Raman and IR results. This result could be speculated that CeO2 facilitated the decomposition of FeSO4 into Fe2O3 during the calcination process, even at 400 °C. Considering the gas phase catalytic activity results (Fig. 1), in the case of FeOx/CeO2 (N) catalysts, both NO and CO conversion and N2 selectivity were improved with increasing Fe loading up to 5% and then leveled off at > 5%, while 30 % FeOx/CeO2 (N) show little lower catalytic performance between 250 °C and 300 °C. The stop in activity increase at ≥10 % FeOx/CeO2 (N) catalysts could be due to the excessive amount of surface FeOx, which has weaker interaction with the surface CeO2 and could not improve the catalytic activity. In the case of the series of FeOx/CeO2 (S) catalysts, catalytic activity and N2 selectivity displayed the totally different trend compared to the FeOx/CeO2 (N) catalysts. Fig. 8 showed a more direct comparison between the T50 for NO conversion and temperature at 50 % N2 selectivity for the FeOx/CeO2 (N and S) catalysts. As shown in Fig. 8, there was a big increase in NO T50 between 1%, 5% and 10 % FeOx/CeO2 (S) catalysts, possibly due to the increased FeSO4 amount with increasing Fe loading. From the comparison between the catalytic activity of FeOx/CeO2 (N) and FeOx/CeO2 (S), it is reasonable to conclude that the presence of surface FeSO4 could have adverse effects on the catalytic activity in NO reduction by CO reaction, while physical property of both catalysts were relatively similar. 5 Conclusions In the current work, two series of CeO2 supported FeOx catalysts (from 1 wt% to 30 wt%) with two different iron precursors (iron nitrate and iron sulfate) were synthesized, characterized and tested for the NO reduction by CO reaction. The two series of FeOx/CeO2 catalysts showed similar trend in physical property changes – as the Fe loading increased, the catalysts’ specific surface area as well as total pore volume both decreased accordingly. Combining the XRD, Raman, FT-IR, and EDS results, it could be concluded that, for the FeOx/CeO2 (N) catalysts, the surface Fe species only consisted of FeOx and Fe2O3, and the monolayer coverage for Fe2O3 is <10 wt%. For the FeOx/CeO2 (S) catalysts, both Fe2O3 and FeSO4 were identified in the surface Fe species and the monolayer coverage could be ≥ 10 wt%. The precursor effects on the catalytic activity were significant. Firstly, with the same Fe loading, the FeOx/CeO2 (N) catalysts performed better in terms of NO and CO conversion, as well as N2 selectivity; Secondly, as the Fe loading increase, the FeOx/CeO2 (N) catalysts showed an increase in catalytic activity up to ∼5%, then the catalytic activity leveled off even with higher Fe loading. On the other hand, the series of FeOx/CeO2 (S) catalysts showed different trend where the catalytic activity decreased as the Fe loading increased, which was speculated to be caused by the catalyst poisoning by FeSO4. Overall, this work could serve as a guide to choose a proper precursor to achieve higher catalytic activity. Author contributions The manuscript was written through contributions of all authors.

        "dc:description": "During the catalyst synthesis process, the precursor chosen could have great impact on the physiochemical and surface properties of the catalysts. More importantly, the precursor could result in very different catalytic activities of the catalyst. In this work, two series of FeOx/CeO2 catalysts were prepared using iron nitrate/sulfate precursors with a wide range of Fe loading (1 wt% – 30 wt%). The catalytic activity, physical property, surface morphology and surface/molecular structure were investigated using GC, BET, XRD, Raman, FT-IR as well as SEM and EDS techniques. From the results, although the physical properties (specific surface area, total pore volume) of the catalyst were similar with different precursors, the surface composition and molecular structures were very different. The iron nitrate precursor fully transformed into FeOx after the calcination process, whereas the iron sulfate precursor only partially transformed into FeOx, leaving some FeSO4 on the catalyst surface. The catalytic activity results suggested that a near monolayer coverage of FeOx on the catalyst surface was crucial to increase the catalytic activity in the NO reduction by CO reaction, while the presence of FeSO4 had advert impacts on the catalytic activity.",
