Introduction The physical and chemical properties of organometallic compounds are known [ 1-4] to be sensitive to the nature of the ligands bound to the metal atom. Owing to their transeffects and trans- influences, tertiary phosphanes are recognized as the best \"non-participating ligands\" in tailoring transition metal complexes for their application as homogeneous catalysts [ 1-5 ] . The substitution of R in PR3 or P(OR)3, where R is alkyl or aryl group, easily accessible through synthetic organic chemistry [5,6], can give the desired Q 7relectronic rearrangement and steric qualities to the phosphanes and these account for their great versatility [ 17]. *Corresponding author; fax (+55-162)749163. 0304-5102/94/$07.00 a 1994 Elsevier Science B V All rights reserved SSD10304-5102(94)00018-Q 258 J.C. do Nascirnento Filho et al. /Journal of Molecular Catal)'sts 90 (199-f) 257-266 The traps-effect (the effect of a coordinated group on the rate of substitution of the ligand trans to itself) [8,9] and the traps-influence (trans bond weakening effect) [8,91 series are qualitative and quite limited in terms of the number of ligands considered [8,91. With the exception of a few reports on octahedral systems [ 8,9a,9c,10] , these series are mainly devoted to square planar complexes [ 8,9,11 ] . Furthermore, the majority of the reported studies involve metal centers coordinated to different ligands, or in many cases \"noninnocent ligands\". This makes it very difficult to establish correlations between the \"nonparticipating ligand\" properties and the changes they induce on the metal center upon coordination. Therefore, despite many attempts to assess the traps-effects and traps-influences of a ligand using physical data [9a,9c,111, the choice of a desired \"non-participating ligand\" is still currently guided by the experience of the researcher [ 2,3,5,12 ] . In this paper we propose a simple and reliable method to evaluate the relative traps-effect and traps-influence of phosphanes, using trans-[ Ru(NH3)IP(III)(H=O)]'+ complexes and pyrazine, (pz), as a probe. Tertiary phosphine and phosphite ligands, P(III), were examined due to the wide range of well-characterized steric and electronic properties associated with these ligands. 2. Experimental 2.1. Chemicals and reagents The solvents employed were distilled before use. Doubly distilled water was used throughout. All chemical reagents were of analytical grade. Pyrazine, pz, (Aldrich Puriss grade) was used as supplied. Synthesis of the ruthenium compounds trans-[ Ru(NH3)4(P(III))2]XZ and trans[Ru(NH3)4P(III)(H,O)]X,, (where P(III)=phosphine or phosphite, X=PF6- Or CF3S03 ), were done according to procedures already described [ 13-16]. 2.2. Apparatus and techniques The preparations, manipulations and solution transferences were carried out under argon by standard procedures [ 17 ] . All the complexes were stored under vacuum and protected from light. The purity of the complexes was always checked by means of cyclic voltammetry and spectrophotometric measurements [ 13-16]. CF;COONa/CF3COOH aqueous solutions were used to control the ionic strength. During the spectrophotometric and electrochemical measurements the temperature was controlled to within +_ 0.2 C. The cyclic voltammetric measurements were performed in a multifunctional PARC system consisting of a model 175 Universal Programmer, a model 173 potent iostat-galvanostat, a Model 264A polarographic analyser and a model Re-0074 X-Y recorder. A conventional three-electrode electrochemical cell was used. Glassy carbon, platinum wire and SCE were used as the working, auxiliary and reference electrodes, respectively. The formal potential J. C. do Nascimento Filho et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 90 (1994) 257-266 259 E ' z (Ru (III) /Ru(II)) were obtained from cyclic voltammograms, or through differential pulse polarograms [ 18 ] . For slow reactions measurements absorbance spectra recording and absorbance were performed using a Hewlett-Packard 8450 diode-array spectrophotomer. Aminco-Morrow stopped-flow apparatus was used for fast reactions. The reactions were studied with pz concentration > 10-fold that of the aquocomplex. Under these conditions, in all experiments, pseudo-first-order rate constants (kobs) were obtained. The observed pseudo-first-order rate constant for the approach to equilibrium [ 19 ] in the studied reaction is expressed by: kobsa -ki [Pz] +k-, Values of k, and k-, were calculated from the slope and intercept of plots of koW versus [ pz ] using a standard least squares program. The K,, were calculated from the quotient k, / k-,. In same cases, the K,,, was calculated also using the spectrophotometric method described by Babko [ 10e,20 ] . A good agreement (uncertainty less than 15%) was observed for the K., calculated from both procedures. Since the pKa values [21 ] for the acids trans- [Ru(NH3)QP(OH)3(H,O) ]2+ and trans[Ru(NH3)4(P(OH) (OEt)Z) (H,O) ]=+ are respectively 4.7 and 3.7, the experiments with the protonated species were carried out at pH 1.7 (CF3COOH/NaCF3C00) and with the deprotonated complexes trans- [Ru(NH3)4(P(O) (OR)) (H,O) ] +, (R=Hand Et) at pH 6.1 (CF;COOH/NaCF3C00, CH3COOH/NaCH3C00). 3. Results and discussion The substitution reactions of trans- [Ru(NH3)aL(H20) ]2+ complexes, as observed for others db low-spin octahedral systems [ 10d,15,22], involves mainly a dissociative process in which the complex accumulates most of the activation energy without any significant bond making with the entering group. In these complexes the four NH3, oriented along the x and 3, axis are kinetically more stable than the other two ligands set to the z direction. Also it is well documented [ 15,19,22,23 ] to be the kinetic and thermodynamic reactivities of the position trans to the ligand, L, dependent on the nature of L and that Ru(II) is a strong 7rdonor and weak o--acceptor. Pyrazine was chosen as a probe since all the trans-[ Ru(NH3)4P(III)(pz)]Z+ species exhibit very intense metal-to-ligand charge transfer bands (MLCT) in the visible region of the spectra, ( e > 3 X 10; M- I . CM- 1) [ 15 ] the pyrazine is very soluble in water (saturated solution > 1 M), is a very good 7r-acid and very week o--base and has pKa equal [23,24] to 0.50 allowing experiments to be performed in a wide range of pH.

Fig. 1 illustrates the plots of k~hs versus cp , obtained for the above reaction. A tendency for rate saturation at cP, higher than 0.10 M, is a common feature for the systems here described. Extensive analysis of the experimental data in accord with 1,, and D mechanisms models suggests that bond breaking is more important than bond making when pz is the entering ligand [ l Od, l0e,15,16,25 ] . Based on the accumulated data [ 13-16 ] for such a system and assuming these substitution reactions as occurring through a dissociative activation pathway [ lOd,10e,15,16,25 ] , the specific rate constant, k,, at which the water molecule is substituted by pz, (related to 4G,ss ), is proposed as an indicator of the relative traps-effect of P(111). The ratio (k_ ,,/ (k, ) = 1 /K.q, is related to the free energy parameter AG~y, and is suggested as a measure of the traps-influence of P(111). The results of the kinetic investigation are listed in Table 1. From k, data the following increasing order is established for the traps-effect series*: ETPB - P(OPh), < PTA < P(OC,H,Cl)3 < PPh; < dppe = H,Pcy = P(OME); < P(OEt)3 < DMPP < P(Bu'); P(OPr')3 -< P(OH)(OEt)2 - P(OH); < P(Bu\")3 < P(Et); < P(OH)2O- < P(OEt)ZO-. The sequences of traps-effects and traps-influences for P(OMe);, P(OEt);, P(OPr)3, P(O'Pr)3 and P(OBu);, measured using isonicotinamide [16] (pKa=3.5) instead of pz, exhibits the same tendency of the above series.

One must be careful in interpreting trans-effect and trans-influence on basis of the electronic parameter. The phosphanes are biphilic ligands [7a,26] and the separation of the electronic parameter into -1r and o- components are complicated by the synergism between these two components of the metal-phosphanes bond [7a,26]. At the moment, we do not have a complete explanation for the positions of all the phosphanes in the above series. Parts of the trans-effect series are explained by taking into account the higher 7r-acidic character of phosphites with respect to their corresponding phosphines, leading to higher ligand field strength. As a consequence of a higher ligand field parameter AP(OR)31 the ground state is more stable when compared to the transition state and therefore the water ligand is less labile. The E z - E' values of Ru(III) / Ru (II) couples, Table 1, decreased by 0.5 V from P(11I) -P(OPh)3 to P(OH)ZO- which is related to a corresponding increase of more than three orders of magnitude in the k, rate constant. The plot of logk, versus ER ( /a\"(ct> for 262 J.C. do Nasctmento Fllho et al. /Journal of bfolecular Catalysis 90 (1994) 257-266 the trans- [Ru(NH3)QP(III) (H=O) ] 3+/`+ species, displayed a very good linear fit (Fig. 2), defining the relationship: logk, -4.07-7.59 ER (nt)/R (t,). The relevance of the o- and 7r components for the Ru(II) and Ru(III) centers has been exhaustively discussed in the literature [ IOd,l0e,15,22,27]. It is well accepted that the 7rcomponent is far more important than the Q for Ru(II)-P(III) bond and the reverse occurs when dealing with the Ru(III) center. Therefore, the more positive the EA (ttt)/Ru(It,. the more stable is the Ru(II) state with respect to the Ru(III) state. Since this stabilization is basically due to the Ru(II) -j P(III) back-bonding, it is reasonable to assume for the above series that the strong back-bonding interaction occurs when P(III)=P(OPh)3 and the weaker at P(OH)20-. The back bonding Ru(II) - P(III) increases the effective charge on the ruthenium center accounting for the change in the lability of the coordinate water molecule [ 15,22 ] . Therefore, starting from P(OPh)3 and finishing with P(OH)20-, a monotonous decrease in the 7r-acid character with and simultaneous increase on the cr basicity can be observed over the series. Although poorer* than the correlation mentioned above, a tendency towards linear correlation is also observed in plots of log( 1/Key) and logk- t versus EK (,tt)tRR(ttl. Therefore, the relative reactivity of the P(III) ligands could be easily estimated from these plots if the formal potential for the Ru(III) /Ru(II) couple in the trans-[ Ru(NH3)4P(III)H, O];+/z+ system is known. The trans- influence series is probably a consequence of the competition between P(III) 103 102- h ra, ,s '~ 10 y s 1 JO l 010 020 030 040 050 060 070 E '(vl Fig 2.

Since they are better 7r-acids than phosphines, phosphites always exhibit a greater trans-influence than the analogous phosphines. Tolman [7a] has proposed an empirical electronic parameter, v, based on the influence of the substituent P(III) group over the infrared carbonyl stretching frequency in [Ni(CO)3Ptn] complexes. Bonding [28] by CO involves both adonation by the carbonyl carbon and back-donation from a filled metal d-jr orbital to the unfilled antibonding rr' orbital of CO. The extension of the back-bonding Ni-jC0 will be a function of the d, electrons availability from the metal center which reflects on the C=O bond order and accordingly on the vco stretching frequencies. When both CO and P(III) are bonded to the same metal center, trans to one another, they will compete for the same filled metal d, orbital. Experimental data shows that phosphines exhibit lower vco frequencies than phosphites and therefore they are considered weaker 7r-acceptors than P(OR);. In light of these arguments it is possible to relate the increase of phosphane ar-acidity with the increase of vco frequencies [7a] measured for the [Ni(CO)3P(III) ] complexes. Fig. 3 shows a plot of vco, obtained from the literature [7a], (Table 1) versus the logk, data presented in this paper. A linear relationship is observed which follows the same tendency of the plot of ER (tn>iR ctt) versus logk,. This behavior suggests that the lability of the Ru(II)-H,O bond increases as the P(III) ir-acidity decreases and a-basicity increases. Plots of vco versus log(1 /K,,) also exhibit a linear tendency, see Fig. 4, suggesting that the stronger the 7r-acid character of the P(III), the stronger will be its trans-influence. The above arguments provide additional support of our interpretations of the relative trans-effect and trans-influence series of the phosphanes dealt with in this study. As observed for aquocobaloximes [ l0a] , no defined relationship is observed by plotting 10' 10 101 i T 1i 2055 206'0 2065 2070 2075 2080 2085 2090 v icn7 -1% Fig. 3.

The pK, of phosphanes is also a very useful parameter to correlate P(III) reactivity. For the phosphines PPh,, PBu3 and PEt3 the traps-effect increases along with the basicity of the phosphane but the trans-influence follows the reverse trend. Unfortunately, due to the scarcity of pKa data available [29] for the P(III) ligands involved with in this study, no more extended correlations between k,, k_, and Key data and phosphanes basicity could be drawn. If is surprising that despite the large amount of papers [ 8,9,11 ] dealing with tr-ans-effect and traps-influence in square planar systems and the relevance of P(III) ligands [ 1-16], comparatively little data is available regarding the phosphanes ligands relative reactivities. Only a limited member of phosphanes are considered and they are mainly phosphines. Combining the available data [4] it is possible to write the following sequence of increasing traps-effect for the square planar complexes: P(Bu),<P(Et)3<P(Ph);<P(OMe)J, which is just the reverse of the observed order for the octahedral Ru(II) systems. This should not be surprising since square planar species (16 electrons) substitute through associative mechanism whereas octahedral complexes ( 18 electrons) generally follow dissociative [ 19] pathways. The study reported here is limited on scope since it refers to only one class of ligands: the phosphanes. Therefore, more data for quite diverse ligands should be obtained before one proposes a more general explanation for the traps-effect and traps-influence series in octahedral complexes. However, as far as the phosphanes are concerned the model proposed here could be very useful for modeling coordination compounds. The syntheses of the trans[Ru(NH3)4P(III) (H,O) ]-+ complex ions are well established [ 15J and the formal potentials ER (ttt),au,tt> for these species are easily accessible experimentally, making the above approach very convenient.
