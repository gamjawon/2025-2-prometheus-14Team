It is now the fundamental of various modern technologies that would support a sustainable and green society. Therefore, “fundamental” seems a lasting label of electrocatalysis. Then, what is fundamental electrocatalysis? This is the question we asked ourselves when conceiving this special issue. We believe there is a wide consensus on what electrocatalysis is about. It is concerned about the transformation between electricity and energy stored in chemical bonds, crucially involving catalytic phenomena and steps. The ambiguity is mainly caused by the modifier ‘fundamental’. From Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, fundamental means “relating to the most basic and important parts of something”. Thus, the question is equivalent to “What are the most basic and important parts of electrocatalysis?”. The conjunction ‘and’ between basic and important is crucial in this context. It should go without saying that the most basic parts are very important to a scientific or technologic area, but not necessarily vice versa. It now seems that we have grasped a bit more about fundamental electrocatalysis. However, we still do not have a clear definition of “the most basic and important parts of electrocatalysis”. Everyone could and should have their own list. That is to say, there is a polysemy of fundamental electrocatalysis, which we should celebrate because polysemy means richness and diversity, both fertilizing the research field of electrocatalysis. Below is a list where our prejudices must have lurked, (1) Controlling factors of electrocatalytic activity and their correlations with physicochemical properties of the electrocatalyst, the electrolyte solution, and the operating conditions such as the electrode potential. (2) Elementary processes occurring in interface between the electrocatalyst and the nearby electrolyte solution, termed the electric double layer (EDL). (3) Structure and dynamics of the surface and EDL in electrocatalytic process. Each point in the above list is a very broad topic, which can be investigated using different approaches, be it theoretical or experimental or combined, from different angels, such as the chemical angel that emphasizes atomistic details and spectroscopic evidences, and the physical angel that emphasizes the generalization and conciseness. Apparently, the population of the community favoring the chemical angel is much bigger than that of the community favoring the physical angel. That fact means that research works with a chemical flavor are read and cited more times than those with a physical flavor. Needless to say, this by no means implies that the former is nobler or more important than the latter. Controlling factors of electrocatalytic activity Six out of sixteen papers in this special issue are more related to the first point. The modifier ‘more’ is necessary here because each paper is also related to the other two points as well. The underlying reason is that electrocatalysis is one and a division into different factors is a concession to human weakness. The prevailing norm of analyzing controlling factors of electrocatalytic activity is the thermodynamic analysis based on the computational hydrogen electrode method. Volcano relationships between electrocatalytic activity and binding energies of adsorbed intermediates can be derived. Such volcano plots are then used in screening of electrocatalysts, see the review by Wu et al. Jiang et al. applied this norm to nitrogen reduction reaction, and proposed a combinatorial descriptor. Chen and Ji extended this norm to high-entropy alloys. Interestingly enough, Chen and Ji discussed how distributions of binding energy at different active sites can help break the scaling relationship. Li et al. encouraged us to look beyond the norm in theoretical electrocatalysis. A key step forward is to compute activation barrier at a constant electrode potential. The authors adopted the constant capacitance method to enable the calculation of activation barrier at any electrode potential. The obtained results are then provided into a suitable microkinetic model, of which the output can be compared readily with experimental data. They also discussed the nuance in the treatment of water structure in density functional theory (DFT) calculations and the consideration of parallel pathways in microkinetic modelling. Tackling the same challenge from a different approach, Exner proposed to go beyond the normal thermodynamic analysis by describing the potential dependence of the activation barrier with a transfer coefficient. He could simplify the consideration of multiple elementary steps to a single descriptor, named G max(η). This G max(η) is defined as the free-energy span from the intermediate with lowest free energy to the intermediate with highest free energy, which is an approximation to the free-energy span model, which is relied on the free-energy span from the intermediate with lowest free energy to the transition state with highest free energy in the free-energy landscape. Specifically, Exner demonstrated how the G max(η) approach works with the example of nitrogen reduction reaction. He calculated the free-energy differences between the product N2 and possible N-containing intermediates (*NN, *NNH, *NNH2, *N, *NH, *NH2, *NHNH, *NHNH2, and *NH2NH2) at a certain electrode potential. This approach is in principle general to other reactions. Though potential-dependent kinetics has been in part considered, the above approaches neglect totally the EDL effects. There are multiple EDL effects in electrocatalysis. First of all, the real overpotential imposed on the electron transfer reaction is different from the applied overpotential because there is a potential distribution in the EDL. One shall correct this potential drop in the EDL, so-called Frumkin correction. Second, the activation barrier of the electron transfer reaction is determined by the solvent reorganization energy, which depends on the local electric field and solvation structure in the EDL. Third, the solvent dynamics in the EDL is different from that in the bulk solution, and is surely influenced by the EDL structure. Sarabia, Climent and Feliu studied how the coverage of Fe(OH)2 on Pt(111) affects its activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). They observed the general trend that the HER activity decreases when the coverage of Fe(OH)2 grows. However, there is an outlier in the relationship between the HER activity and the coverage of Fe(OH)2. The HER activity is highest at a minimum, not specified coverage of Fe(OH)2. To understand such a relationship, they employed CO displacement and laser-induced temperature jump techniques to understand the interfacial properties. They correlated the HER activity with the interfacial electric field, derived from the laser-induced temperature jump technique. This study provides important clues to the importance of interfacial water molecules on electrocatalytic reactions occurring in the EDL. Huang et al. revealed a new EDL effect. Their ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation showed that the negative surface charge on Pt(111) repels the oxygen-oxygen bond of hydrogen peroxide farther away, resulting in a higher activation barrier for breaking the oxygen-oxygen bond. They further incorporated this microscopic mechanism into a comprehensive microkinetic-double-layer model, and explained why the activity of hydrogen peroxide reduction is anomalously suppressed with decreasing electrode potential. The hierarchical framework developed by Huang et al. represents a meaningful attempt to treat the crucial interplay between elementary electron transfer kinetics, multistep microkinetics, and EDL effects. Elementary processes in the EDL Elementary processes in electrocatalysis, including electron transfer, adsorption and desorption, solvation and desolvation, occur in the nanoscale EDL at a time scale much faster than nanosecond. Therefore, in-situ, in-operando characterization of such elementary processes is difficult. That does not mean we can do nothing. One thing we can do is to capture a fragment of elementary processes using various spectroscopic approaches. Another thing that is also popular is to simulate such elementary processes using modern quantum mechanical approaches. Additionally, we can also defer the properties of these elementary processes from averaged overall signals, with the help of models. Su, Chang and Xu contributed a review on surface-enhanced vibrational spectroscopies (SERS) in electrocatalysis, with emphasis put on surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and surface-enhanced infrared adsorption spectroscopy. They introduced the basics of SERS studies, including the principles, the electrochemical cell design, preparation of electrocatalysts, as well as other important know-hows. As an active group in this field, they presented a frank discussion over the technical challenges of these SERS tools. For instance, they shared their experience about how to detect relevant reaction intermediates, not site blockers, how to assign peaks correctly with careful experimental design or with the help of computational studies, and how to quantitatively analyze the results. In the end, they also provided a thoughtful perspective on how to increase the spatial and temporal resolution, how to combine different approaches to enable a multimodal in situ characterization, and how to get electrokinetic and thermodynamic information from SERS. Li et al. discussed in situ vibrational spectroscopy studies of carbon dioxide reduction, covering a wide range of aspects including the reaction pathways and intermediates, the multifaceted roles of adsorbed carbon monoxide, the effects of the catalyst structure, and the electrolyte effects. AIMD simulations can provide crucial information about elementary processes in electrocatalysis, as exemplified by the study of CO dimerization on strained Cu surfaces by Liu, Liu and Yang, and the study of solvation and dynamics of lithium, lithium peroxide and their transformation by Didar and Gross. In the work of Liu, Liu and Yang, the free energy profile of the dimerization process of two adsorbed CO on Cu was calculated, and the activation barrier of that process was then obtained. They carefully examined the dependence of the activation barrier on the strain applied. Specifically, they observed that the activation barrier is decreased when the strain changes from tensile to compressive. They delved into the underlying reason of the strain dependence of the activation barrier. Interestingly enough, they found a linear correlation between the activation barrier and the net charge per Cu atom. The more negatively charged the surface Cu atoms, the higher the activation barrier for the dimerization process. Didar and Gross systematically studied the atomistic structure of the solvated lithium ion and lithium peroxide in three organic solvent molecules, and the free energy profile of the transformation from a lithium ion to a lithium peroxide molecule. These unprecedented atomistic information lays the basis for understanding the reaction mechanism of lithium-mediated oxygen reduction in aprotic electrolyte solution. This work constitutes a meaningful step towards first-principles based understanding of fundamental processes in lithium-oxygen batteries, and rational design of metal-oxygen batteries that are actively studied, for example, see the work of Liu et al. Lu et al. experimented the activity of hydrogen evolution reaction at Pd nanoparticles in a confined microchannel using the single-nanoparticle collision approach. Their experimental data raised interesting questions about the collision dynamics of Pd nanoparticles with the microchannel, and ensuing charging of the EDL of Pd nanoparticles and hydrogen evolution reactions. They provided the data at a series of electrode potential. Understanding the potential dependence of the collision dynamics and charge transfer dynamics is an interesting task for future theoretical works. Structure of surface and EDL Understanding EDL structure is a century-old problem. We have quite a number of models for the EDL structure. Though these models have been compared with experiments in terms of overall quantities like the double layer capacitance, they are still incompletely verified due to the lack of atomistic information. Therefore, development of experimental approach for operando characterization of the EDL is crucial. Liu et al. developed a novel lab-based operando X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic method which can provide crucial microscopic information about the EDL structure. They introduced in great detail about the system design, sample preparation, data analysis, and performance metrics of the system. The method was applied in two case studies. In the first case, the O 1s, Pt 4f, Pt 3d spectra of a polycrystalline platinum electrode in water vapor at 17 Torr were reported as a series of electrode potentials. The occurrence of Pt2+ was observed above 0.935 V, corresponding to the electro-oxidation of the Pt surface. In the second case, the method was applied to probe a solid-gas interface to detect the discharge products of a sodium-oxygen battery. Wu et al. developed an in-situ electrochemical SERS method for the electrode/polyelectrolyte interfaces with electrocatalytic reactions occurring therein. They firstly verified the relevance of their special electrochemical cell by examining their cyclic voltammograms. Then, they proceeded to study the potential-dependent SERS profiles. They observed the vibrational Stark effect with a high signal-to-noise ration. This study laid a solid technical basis for investigating electrode/polyelectrolyte interfaces and the electrocatalytic reactions occurring there in future. In most cases, we assume a static picture of the EDL. However, the EDL undergoes dynamical structural changes in reality. Therefore, understanding the structural dynamics of the EDL is also needed. Wei et al. summarized evidences for restructuring processes of Pt-based electrodes even under mild electrochemical conditions, and reviewed a few studies showing how such restructuring processes affect the activity of electrocatalytic reactions. This paper reminds us of the intrinsically dynamic nature of surface and EDLs when modelling/experimenting them. Concluding remarks This special issue may provide a window to the huge landscape of research activities aimed at unveiling the basics of electrocatalysis, as well as cultivating the next breakthrough in electrochemical energy conversion and storage techniques. We are grateful to the sixteen groups of authors and editors of this journal to make this special issue possible.",
