Introduction Environmental pollution and energy shortage are major challenges that humanity faces today [1,2], and that need to be solved to realize sustainable development in China and the rest of the world [3]. As the extent of global environmental pollution and energy shortage increase, developing green lowâ€�carbon technology is becoming increasingly important. Photocatalysis is a green lowâ€�carbon technology that directly uses solar light to decompose organic pollutants in water or air and eliminate environmental pollution [4,5]. It can also convert solar energy into chemical energy for further use [6,7]. Therefore, photoâ€� catalytic technology has great potential both in controlling enâ€� vironmental pollution and developing new energy sources. The essence of photocatalytic technology is maximizing the performance of photocatalysts. A large number of new semiâ€� conductor photocatalysts, such as CdS, SnO2, ZnO, ZnS, and WO3, have been explored since Fujishima and Honda [8] first achieved photocatalytic splitting of water by a TiO2 electrode. Among these photocatalysts, TiO2 is considered an almost ideal example because it is cheap, nontoxic, stable, reproducible, and recyclable [9]. However, there are still two major bottlenecks limiting the industrial application of nanosized TiO2 (nanoâ€�TiO2) as a photocatalyst: (1) it only responds to ultraviâ€� olet (UV) light, so the use efficiency of solar energy is very low because UV light is less than 5% of the solar spectrum [5,10,11]; and (2) the recombination rate of photoexcited charge carriers is high, so the quantum efficiency of nanoâ€�TiO2 * Corresponding author.

Catal., Vol. 34, No. 4, April 2013 CHEN Jianwei et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 621â€“640 is low. Combining semiconductors and carbon to form composite materials is expected to solve these problems to a certain exâ€� tent, so these photocatalytic materials are worth exploring. At present, carbon materials including graphite, carbon black, activated carbon, carbon fibers, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and fullerenes [12,13] have been combined with semiconductors. Graphene (abbreviated as GR) is another type of carbon mateâ€� rial, and is composed of a single layer of sp 2 â€�bonded carbon atoms, as shown in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image and schematic diagram in Fig. 1. The basic construction unit of GR is the stable benzene ring with a monolayer thickâ€� ness of 0.35 nm [14]. GR is the basic unit in numerous carbon materials including graphite, CNTs, and fullerenes [15â€“17]. Compared with CNTs and fullerenes, GR has higher conductiviâ€� ty and chemical stability, and improved mechanical properties. Furthermore, the unique twoâ€�dimensional planar structure and high specific surface of GR mean that it shows great potential as a carrier and multifunctional material for transferring electrons and holes. Semiconductor/graphene composite photocatalysts have been a hot topic of research in recent years. Numerous studies have been reported [18], and some reviews have also emerged. For example, Yu et al. [19] summarized the methods used to prepare GRâ€�based semiconductor photocatalysts and their use in environmental and energy applications in detail, while Xu et al. [20] reviewed the present applications of grapheneâ€�based photocatalysts (especially the photocatalytic selective transâ€� formation of organic substances) and their prospects for future development. To comprehensively understand the latest proâ€� gress of semiconductor/GR composite photocatalysts, here we review the methods used to prepare these photocatalysts, and their application in decomposing organic pollutants, photoâ€� catalytic splitting of water to produce H 2, photocatalytic reducâ€� tion of CO2 to produce organic fuels, and photocatalytic steriliâ€� zation. We summarize the photocatalytic mechanisms of semiâ€� conductor/Gr composite photocatalysts, as well as their curâ€� rent research and prospects for development. The purpose of this review is to expose and correlate the latest research proâ€� gress in this field. 2. Preparation of semiconductor/GR composite photocatalysts The method used to prepare composite photocatalysts can directly affect their morphology, structure, size, properties, and activity. The major methods used to prepared semiconducâ€� tor/GR composite photocatalysts to date are outlined in the following sections. 2.1. Hydro/solvothermal methods Hydro/solvothermal methods are traditionally used to grow crystalline semiconductor materials, but are also effective methods to synthesize semiconductor/GR composite materials. Generally, the procedure is carried out as follows: first, semiâ€� conductors (or semiconductor precursors) are anchored on graphene oxide (abbreviated as GO) or GR, and then GO is reâ€� duced to GR under hydro/solvothermal conditions to produce semiconductor/GR composite photocatalysts. In general, chemical bonds form between semiconductors and GR when the hydro/solvothermal method is used to synâ€� thesize semiconductor/GR composite photocatalysts. This reâ€� sults in a synergic effect between the semiconductors and GR, which can improve the photocatalytic properties of the compoâ€� site compared with those of the semiconductor or GR alone. Zhang et al. [21] prepared a TiO2 (P25)/GR nanocomposite photocatalyst with chemical bonds between GR and P25 using a oneâ€�step hydrothermal method. The P25/GR photocatalyst readily adsorbed dyes and exhibited efficient charge separation simultaneously. Gao et al. [22] successfully synthesized a chemically bonded Bi2WO6/GR composite photocatalyst by a hydrothermal method. Semiconductor particles usually distribute uniformly on GR in semiconductor/GR composite photocatalysts prepared by hydro/solvothermal methods. For example, Neppolian et al. [23] fabricated a uniform Pt/TiO2/GO composite photocatalyst using a hydrothermal method. Li et al. [24] synthesized a semâ€� iconductor/GR composite photocatalyst with CdS uniformly dispersed on GR using a solvothermal method. ZnO nanopartiâ€� cles densely and uniformly deposited on the surface of GR sheets were fabricated by Wu and coworkers [25]. Wang et al. [26] fabricated TiO2/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) with disâ€� persed TiO2 particles using a hydrothermal method. Semiconductor/GR composite photocatalysts with specific morphologies can also be obtained using hydro/solvothermal methods. For example, Ding et al. [27] used a solvothermal method to synthesize GRâ€�supported ultrathin anatase TiO2 nanosheets with exposed (001) highâ€�energy facets. A modified oneâ€�step hydrothermal method to fabricate leafâ€�like TiO2/RGO composites, as shown in Fig. 2, was developed by Shenâ€™s group [28]. Zou et al. [29] reported a simple and general nanocrysâ€� talâ€�seedâ€�directed (NSD) hydrothermal route to grow TiO2, ZnO, MnO2, CuO, and ZrO2 nanorod arrays on both sides of flexible GR sheets to form sandwichâ€�like MO/G/MO (M = Ti, Zn, Mn, Cu, Zr) heterostructures. These composites possessed uniform morphologies (as shown in Fig. 3) with chemical bonds formed between semiconductors and graphene. 2.2. Solution mixing method 10 ï�­m Crystal faces Â Fig. 1.Â SEM image and schematic diagram of the atomic structure of grapheme (GR) [14].Â CHEN Jianwei et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 621â€“640 Preparing composite photocatalysts by mixing a suspension of GR (or GO) with a solution of semiconductor (or semiconâ€� ductor precursors), followed by drying, calcination, and other simple treatments, is called the solution mixing method. Comâ€� pared with hydro/solvothermal methods, the solution mixing method has the advantages of mild reaction conditions, simâ€� plicity, and low cost. However, it is difficult to form chemical bonds between semiconductors and GR using this method beâ€� cause of the mild reaction conditions, which influences the performance of the resulting composite photocatalysts. There are many reports of semiconductor/GR composite photocatalysts prepared using the solution mixing method, in particular TiO2/GR [30â€“35]. Guo et al. [30] obtained a TiO2/GR composite photocatalyst by directly mixing suspensions of TiCl4 and GO together and then reducing GO to GR with hydraâ€� zine. Liu and coworkers [31] prepared two composite photoâ€� catalysts, TiO2 nanorods/GO and TiO2 nanoparticles/GO by mixing solutions of GO and TiO2 nanorods or nanoparticles, as depicted in Fig. 4. Other semiconductors can also be reacted with GR using the solution mixing method. Xu et al. [36] employed the solution mixing method to prepare a ZnO/GR composite. The groups of Paek [37] and Mukherji [38] synthesized SnO2/GR and Sr2Ta2O7â€�xNx/GR composites, respectively, using the solution mixing method. Because of the simple, mild experimental conditions, multiâ€� ple semiconductor/GR composite photocatalysts can be preâ€� pared simultaneously by the solution mixing method. Iwase et al. [39] mixed solutions of GO with ones of BiVO4 and Ru/SrTiO3:Rh to form hybrid composite photocatalysts Biâ€� VO4/RGO and Ru/SrTiO3:Rh/RGO, respectively. Ng and coworkers [40] mixed solutions of GO with three suspensions of photocatalytic materials (WO3, BiVO4, and TiO2) to form three semiconductor/GR composite photocatalysts, which are shown in Fig. 5. 2.3. In situ growth method In situ growth is also widely used to prepare semiconducâ€� tor/GR composite photocatalysts. In this method, semiconducâ€� tor precursors and GO (or GR) are first mixed. Semiconductor crystals then nucleate on GR and gradually grow by controlling hydrolysis of the semiconductor precursors. Finally, GO is reâ€� duced to GR, resulting in semiconductor/GR composite photoâ€� catalysts. Zhang et al. [41] used graphite and Ti(SO4)2 as the initial reâ€� actants to synthesize a TiO2/GO intercalated composite materiâ€� al at low temperature (<100 Â°C). In the process, [TiO] 2+ groups generated from the hydrolysis of Ti(SO4)2 diffused into the GO layers by electrostatic attraction, followed by in situ nucleation and growth to form the TiO2/GO intercalated composite mateâ€� rial. Jiang and coworkers [42] prepared a TiO2/GR composite Fig. 3. SEM images of sandwich MO/G/MO heterostructures grown by the NSD hydrothermal route [29].

Â CHEN Jianwei et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 621â€“640 by in situ growth of TiO2 in the interlayer of expanded graphite using a vacuumâ€�assisted technique combined with a surfactant. The vacuum environment promoted full infusion of the initial solution containing Ti(OBu)4 and surfactant into the interlayers of expanded graphite. Subsequently, numerous TiO2 nanopartiâ€� cles grew uniformly in the graphite interlayer with the help of the surfactant, eventually forming the TiO2/GR composite. Zhang et al. [43] added solutions of SnCl2 and TiCl3 to a disperâ€� sion of GO. GO was reduced to GR by SnCl2 or TiCl3, and SnO2 and TiO2 nanocrystals grew through hydrolysis. A ZnO/GR composite photocatalyst was also synthesized by the in situ growth method. Zn 2+ ions (the precursor of ZnO) in solution were adsorbed on GO sheets and converted into ZnO nanoparâ€� ticles, and then GO was reduced to GR by addition of NaOH and NaBH4, resulting in a ZnO/GR composite photocatalyst [44]. Du et al. [45] used polystyrene colloidal spheres as templates, and prepared ethanol and tetrahydrofuran colloidal suspensions of P123, TTIP, TiCl4, and GO. A glass substrate covered with polyâ€� styrene opal film was immersed repeatedly in the suspension. The films were treated with hydrazine vapor to reduce GO to GR and then calcined to give hierarchically ordered macâ€� roâ€�mesoporous TiO2/GR composite films, as illustrated in Fig. 6. Lambertâ€™s group [46] synthesized a composite comprising flowerâ€�like anatase TiO2 and GO by hydrolysis of TiF4 in aqueâ€� ous dispersions of GO. Li et al. [47] grew uniform mesoporous anatase TiO2 nanospheres on graphene sheets in situ; the morphology of the resulting composite is shown in Fig. 7. 2.4. Other methods In addition to hydro/solvothermal, solution mixing and in situ growth, some other methods are also used to prepare semiconductor/GR composite photocatalysts, such as electroâ€� chemical deposition, and atomic layer deposition (ALD). Howâ€� ever, these methods are seldom used in practical synthesis because of disadvantages including difficult preparation, and high cost. For example, Du et al. [48] developed an electroâ€� chemical deposition method to prepare a ZrO2/GR composite on a glass carbon electrode. Meng and coworkers [49] used ALD to synthesize TiO2/GR nanocomposites. The morphology of a sample produced by 75 deposition cycles of TiO2 on GR followed by calcination at 250 Â°C under vacuum is shown in Fig. 8. 3. Mechanisms of enhancement of photocatalysis by GR GR and semiconductor materials have been used together in photocatalysts for a relatively short period, and the mechaâ€� nisms resulting in enhanced photocatalysis by these composite (b)(a) Fig. 7.

SEM images of WO3/RGO (a), BiVO4/RGO (b), and TiO2/RGO (c) composite photocatalysts [40]. CHEN Jianwei et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 621â€“640 photocatalysts are currently largely unclear. To date, numerous reports have concluded that the mechanisms of enhanced phoâ€� tocatalysis are as follows. (1) Collection and transport of excited electrons from semiâ€� conductors: semiconductors usually possess a lowâ€�energy vaâ€� lence band (VB) that is full of electrons, a highâ€�energy conducâ€� tion band (CB) with empty orbitals and band gap between them. When a semiconductor is irradiated by light of energy equal to or stronger than the band gap energy (E g), electrons in the VB are excited and transited to the CB, which produces corresponding holes in the VB and electronâ€�hole pairs. The electrons and holes, which have lifetimes of ~nanoseconds, are either transferred to the surface where they take part in redox reactions or recombine to reform the ground state. When GR is introduced into a photocatalytic system, because the CB of most of semiconductors is higher than the Fermi level of GR, the photogenerated electrons are readily transferred from the semiconductor to GR by passing through the interface between them. The electrons are then rapidly transferred to target polâ€� lutants at rates as high as 1.5 Ã— 10 4 cm 2 /(VÂ·s) because the twoâ€�dimensional planar Ï€â€�conjugated structure of GR facilitates charge transfer. Therefore, the mean free path of photogenerâ€� ated electrons is prolonged, which promotes reactions such as the formation of free radicals (hydroxy and superoxide radiâ€� cals) with high activity, nonselective oxidative degradation of organic pollutants, photocatalytic sterilization, reduction of H + to H2 and reduction of CO2 to organic fuels. When the CB of a semiconductor is lower than the Fermi level of GR, the photogenerated electrons cannot be transferred from the semiconductor to GR. If there are sensitizers in the system, they will be sensitized by absorbing photons to generâ€� ate electrons. Because the Fermi level of GR is higher than the CB of semiconductors, electrons are transferred from sensitizâ€� ers to GR and then to the semiconductor. Because of the exâ€� tremely high conductivity and unique twoâ€�dimensional planar structure of GR, it can increase the rate of transfer of photoâ€� generated charge carriers from GR to semiconductors and then to the surfaces of reactants. This increases the mean free path of electrons, and reduces the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, which enhances the photocatalytic quanâ€� tum efficiency of semiconductor/GR composites [50â€“52]. The band structure diagram of GR and some common semiconducâ€� tors, and the major routes of GR to enhance photocatalysis, are displayed in Fig. 9(a) and (b), respectively. This mechanism has been deduced by comparing the results of most reported phoâ€� tocatalytic reactions. Kamatâ€™s group [53] investigated the storâ€� Fig. 9. Photocatalytic mechanisms of semiconductor/GR composites. (a) Band structure diagram of GR and common semiconductors; (b) Major routes of enhanced photocatalysis by GR including improved charge collection and transfer; (c) Narrowing the band gap of the semiconductor; (d) Increasing the adsorption of pollutants. CHEN Jianwei et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 621â€“640 age and transport of electrons by GR by studying the stepwise transfer processes of photogenerated electrons, and confirmed the role of GR in electron transfer in photocatalysts. The color change of a solution of TiO2 and RGO(e) strongly indicated that GR could transfer photogenerated electrons, as shown in Fig. 10. In addition, they reacted GO suspension with ZnO that had been activated by UV irradiation. ZnO particles exhibited green emission (Î»max ~530 nm) arising from oxygen vacancies under band gap excitation, so the green emission acted as a probe to monitor interfacial electronâ€�transfer processes. A decrease in the average lifetime of ZnO emission from 30 to 14 ns was obâ€� served with increasing concentration of GO, and a nearly 20â€�fold decrease in lifetime was observed when the concentraâ€� tion of GO was increased to 0.25 mg/ml. This decrease in lifeâ€� time corresponded to an electronâ€�transfer rate constant of 1.2 Ã— 10 9 s â€“1 . Kamat et al. [54] also conducted other similar experâ€� iments to determine the pathway of electron transfer by using GOâ€� and RGOâ€�based support architectures to collect and transâ€� fer photogenerated electrons. They investigated if the energy level of the semiconductor matched that of GR and whether the interaction between the semiconductor and GR facilitated charge transfer. Wang et al. [55] investigated the photoinduced charge transfer between TiO2 and GR using a transient photoâ€� voltage technique. They found that the mean lifetime of elecâ€� tronâ€“hole pairs was increased from ~10 â€“7 to 10 â€“5 s after TiO2 was combined with GR. (2) Broadening the light absorption range of semiconducâ€� tors: when a semiconductor is combined with GR to form a composite under favorable reaction conditions, a number of Mâ€“C or Mâ€“Oâ€“C (M represents metal) chemical bonds form beâ€� tween the surfaces of the semiconductor and GR to a certain depth, which is analogous to doping a semiconductor with carâ€� bon. As a result, doping energy levels are produced, which narâ€� rows the band gap of the semiconductor. This induces a red shift that increases the response of the semiconductor to visible light. Figure 9(c) depicts this mechanism of enhanced photocaâ€� talysis. (3) Improving the adsorptive capacity for reactants: the large number of Ï€ electrons in GR and its unique twoâ€�dimensional planar single atomic layer can interact with pollutant molecules via Ï€â€�Ï€ conjugation, which enhances the adsorption of pollutants by composite photocatalysts, thereby improving the efficiency of photocatalytic degradation, as shown in Fig. 9(d). Compared with the other carbon materials including graphite, carbon black, activated carbon, carbon fiâ€� bers, carbon CNTs, and fullerenes, GR possesses the largest specific surface area because of its singleâ€�layer twoâ€�dimensional planar structure, which can provide additionâ€� al reaction space. Meanwhile, GR also helps to disperse semiâ€� conductors by decreasing agglomeration, and promoting the contact between semiconductors and pollutants. 4. Application of semiconductor/GR composite photocatalysts 4.1. Photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants Photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants has reâ€� cently become a focus of research. Previous studies have shown that hydrocarbons, halides, carboxylic acids, surfactants, dyes, nitrogenâ€�containing organic pollutants, organophosphorus pesticides, insecticides and other organic pollutants can be completely mineralized into CO 2, H2O, and other harmless maâ€� terials using photocatalytic technology [56]. GR is able to conâ€� siderably improve the photocatalytic activity of semiconducâ€� tors because of its excellent charge transfer properties. It is generally acknowledged that the twoâ€�dimensional plaâ€� nar structure of GR can increase the degradation efficiency of organic pollutants by increasing the adsorption of pollutants, and the transfer and separation of electrons. Furthermore, the carbon atoms in GR can be doped into semiconductors, where they act as a sensitizer to improve the response of composites to visible light and enhance their degradation efficiency. Nguâ€� yenâ€�Phan et al. [35] used TiO2/xGO (x represents the mass ratio of GO to TiO2) to photocatalyze decomposition of methylene blue (MB). They found that the rate constant was increased by 4.47 and 8.52 times for TiO2/1GO and TiO2/10GO composites, respectively, under UV irradiation compared with that of TiO2 alone. The rate constant increased by a factor of 1.37 to 7.15 for these two composites under visible illumination. They thought the oxygenâ€�containing functional groups of GO in the compoâ€� sites could form ionic/electronic interactions with MB, and that GO acted as an additional adsorbent to adsorb MB molecules and aid diffuse (or transfer) MB molecules to the interface beâ€� tween GO and TiO2, which promoted the subsequent photoâ€� catalytic decomposition. In addition, GO acted as an electron acceptor to accelerate the transfer of electrons from the GO/TiO2 interface, which strongly hindered the recombination of charge carriers. Furthermore, GO also photosensitized TiO2, extending the light absorption of the TiO2/GO composite into the visible region. Zhang et al. [21] prepared a TiO2/GR compoâ€� site photocatalyst containing P25. Their composite showed significantly enhanced photocatalytic degradation of MB in water over TiO2 alone, whether it was under UV or visible light. Figure 11 illustrates the degradation mechanism of MB over this composite photocatalyst. Because of its benzeneâ€�based structure, GR can transfer MB molecules from solution to the TiO2 surface through its Ï€â€�Ï€ conjugation, which improves the Fig. 10. Photographs showing the color changes observed during stepâ€� wise transfer of electrons [53]. (1) Storing electrons in TiO2 by irradiâ€� ating the sample with UV light (Î» > 300 nm) for 30 min. (2) Addition of GO until no blue color remains. The gray solution indicates formation of RGO. (3) Reduction of Ag + to Ag nanoparticles (red) by electrons stored in RGO following addition of AgNO3 [53]. CHEN Jianwei et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 621â€“640 adsorption of dye molecules and the separation efficiency of charges. Liang and coworkers [57] fabricated a TiO2/GR comâ€� posite to photocatalytically degrade rhodamine B (RhB). The apparent rate constant of TiO2/GR was four times that of TiO2 and three times that of P25, and it was also higher than that of a TiO2/CNT composite. Ngâ€™s group [58] used a TiO2/GR photoâ€� catalyst to degrade 2,4â€�dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. The degraâ€� dation rate constant of this composite was four times that of bare TiO2. Guo et al. [30], Zhou et al. [59], and Liu et al. [60] also found that the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants by TiO2 was significantly enhanced following its combination with GR. TiO2 with morphologies other than nanoparticles exhibit higher photocatalytic activity to degrade organic pollutants when combined with GR. Liu et al. [31] found that a TiO2 nanoâ€� rod/GO composite showed higher photocatalytic activity than P25, TiO2 nanoparticles, TiO2 nanorods, and a TiO2 nanopartiâ€� cle/GO composite, indicating that the photocatalytic activity of composites depends on the morphology of the semiconductor. TiO2 nanorods suppressed the recombination of charge carriers more effectively than TiO2 nanoparticles, so the TiO2 nanoâ€� rod/GR composite showed higher activity than the TiO2 nanoâ€� particle/GR one. They also investigated the mechanism of phoâ€� tocatalytic degradation of MB by the TiO2 nanorod/GO compoâ€� site, as illustrated in Fig. 12 [61]. Photoexcited electrons were transferred to GO where they reacted with absorbed O2 to form â€¢OH radicals. The high efficiency of charge transfer reduced the recombination of charges and increased the photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 nanorods. The TiO2 nanorod/GO composite showed higher activity than the P25/GO one mainly because of the better contact between GO and TiO2 nanorods and the more effective charge transfer from TiO2 nanorods to GO sheets than between P25 and GO. These results indicate that the photoâ€� catalytic activity of TiO2/GR composites may be improved by optimizing the morphology of TiO2 and the distribution of TiO2 nanoparticles on GR sheets. TiO2/GO and TiO2/GR composite photocatalysts usually possess broader spectral absorption ranges than bare TiO2, so they exhibit higher visible light photocatalytic activity. Chen et al. [62] reported the visible lightâ€�driven photocatalytic perforâ€� mance of a TiO2/GO composite with a p/n heterojunction structure for the degradation of methyl orange (MO). GO beâ€� haved as a pâ€�type semiconductor and sensitizer, and the comâ€� posite could be excited by visible light of wavelength longer than 510 nm. Jiang et al. [44] found that the photocatalytic acâ€� tivity of TiO2/GR to degrade phenol under visible light was about eight times higher than that of P25. They attributed the high photocatalytic activity of the composite to GR increasing charge transport and separation of photogenerated charge carriers, enhancing the light absorption intensity and range of the composite, and improving the adsorption of pollutants. Neppolian et al. [26] used a Pt/TiO2/GO photocatalyst to deâ€� compose dodecylbenzenesulfonate (DBS). The photocatalytic degradation efficiency of DBS by Pt/TiO2/GO was three times that of P25 under simulated sunlight irradiation. Kim and coworkers [63] successfully synthesized a TiO2/GR/carbon fiber composite photocatalyst, and used it to degrade MB under visible light. This composite photocatalyst possessed both higher catalytic activity and favorable recyclability compared with GR, carbon fibers and a TiO2/carbon fiber composite. Khaâ€� lid et al. [64] studied the photocatalytic activity of a Feâ€�doped TiO2/GR composite for MO under visible light. The higher visiâ€� ble lightâ€�induced degradation efficiency of Fe/TiO2/GR than three other catalysts (TiO2, Fe/TiO2, and TiO2/GR) was atâ€� tributed to improved adsorption of dye molecules, increased visible light absorption and effective separation of charges. In addition to TiO2/GR composite photocatalysts, GR has alâ€� so been combined with other semiconductors to improve the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of organic pollutants. Zhang et al. [65] fabricated an InNbO4/GR composite using a hydrothermal method that exhibited higher visible light activiâ€� ty towards MB than InNbO4 alone. They concluded that the enhanced photocatalytic activity was mainly because GR inâ€� creased the adsorption of MB and the separation of charge carâ€� riers. They also demonstrated that oxidative degradation of MB by holes was one mechanism by which MB was decomposed. Sun et al. [66] synthesized an ordered monoclinic BiVO4 quanâ€� tum tube/GR nanocomposite, which exhibited unprecedented Fig. 11. Schematic diagram of a P25/GR composite illustrating adsorpâ€� tion of MB on GR sheets, and the role of GR during the photocatalytic degradation of MB [21]. Fig. 12. Mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of MB by a TiO2 naâ€� norod/GO composite under UV light irradiation [61]. CHEN Jianwei et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 621â€“640 visible lightâ€�driven photocatalytic activity; its rate of degradaâ€� tion of a substrate was over 20 times higher than that of comâ€� mercial P25 and roughly 1.5 times that of bare mâ€�BiVO4 quanâ€� tum tubes. The high photocatalytic activity was attributed to a synergistic effect between the microscopic crystal structure of mâ€�BiVO4 and GR, the strong interaction between mâ€�BiVO4 quantum tubes and GR, as well as the increased number of photocatalytic reaction sites and the improved separation of photogenerated electronâ€�hole pairs induced by the twoâ€�dimensional planar structure of GR. Min and coworkers [67] prepared a Bi2WO6/GR composite that showed three times higher photodegradation of RhB under visible light irradiation compared with bare Bi2WO6. This improvement was attributed to GR acting as a charge transfer channel, which improved the separation efficiency of charges and extended the lifetime of electrons and holes. Xu et al. [68] prepared a ZnO/GR compoâ€� site photocatalyst that exhibited higher activity for degradation of MB than bare ZnO. They thought the presence of GR allowed rapid separation of charges, which meant electrons and holes could participate more fully in the photocatalytic degradation of MB. 4.2. Photocatalytic splitting of water to evolve hydrogen Hydrogen is considered to be the ultimate clean fuel beâ€� cause of its high energy capacity, environmental friendliness and cyclic use. Splitting water to evolve hydrogen using semiâ€� conductor photocatalysts is considered as a promising method to produce hydrogen as a fuel source. However, practical apâ€� plication of this technology is limited by the rapid recombinaâ€� tion of photogenerated electrons and holes in semiconductor photocatalysts. GR exhibits excellent properties regarding the migration of electrons and specific surface area, so it can be used as an effective electron acceptor to accelerate the transfer of photogenerated electrons and suppress charge recombinaâ€� tion. GR does this by separating the production sites of hydroâ€� gen and oxygen, which helps to improve the photocatalytic evolution of hydrogen by semiconductor photocatalysts. In recent years, semiconductor/GR composite photocatalysts have been widely used in photocatalytic splitting of water to produce H2. Here we introduce the features and relevant mechanisms of semiconductor/GR composite photocatalysts in photocatalytic splitting of water to produce H2. LÃ¼ et al. [69] combined GR with CdS and TiO2 nanoparticles, respectively, to fabricate composite photocatalysts, and invesâ€� tigated their photocatalytic ability to generate hydrogen comâ€� pared with those of the same semiconductor materials with platinum as a coâ€�catalyst under the same conditions. The semâ€� iconductor nanoparticle/GR composite photocatalysts disâ€� played higher activity than bare semiconductor and comparaâ€� ble to the photocatalysts with Pt as a coâ€�catalyst. Timeâ€�resolved emission, photocurrent generated response and electrochemiâ€� cal impedance spectra indicated that GR attached to semiconâ€� ductor surfaces could efficiently accept and transport electrons from the excited semiconductor, which suppressed charge reâ€� combination and improved the interfacial charge transfer. Shen et al. [28] found that a heterojunction formed at the interface between TiO2 and RGO in their TiO2/RGO composite, which effectively separated photoexcited electronâ€�hole pairs, and hindered charge recombination, so the composite exhibited good performance for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Li et al. [47] measured the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activâ€� ity of a mesoporous anatase TiO2 nanosphere/GR composite in the presence of methanol as a scavenger, and found that it was 2.3 times higher than that of bare TiO2. They suggested that the photoexcited electrons in the anatase TiO2 conduction band were effectively transferred to GR because the CB minimum of anatase TiO2 was higher than the Fermi level of GR, so the sepâ€� aration efficiency of electronâ€�hole pairs was increased. Both Mou et al. [70] and Min et al. [71] used a composite photocataâ€� lyst composed of RGO sensitized with Eosin (EY) and Pt nanoâ€� particles dispersed on RGO to split water for hydrogen evoluâ€� tion under visible light irradiation, and confirmed that RGO could improve the yield of hydrogen. Zhang and coworkers [72] found that a TiO2/GR composite exhibited a hydrogen evoluâ€� tion rate of 8.6 Î¼mol/h, which was almost twice that of comâ€� mercial P25 (4.5 Î¼mol/h) under the same conditions. Li et al. [24] used a CdS/GR composite photocatalyst to split water for H2 production and found the hydrogen evolution rate of CdS/GR was 4.87 times higher than that of CdS alone. They concluded that GR in the CdS nanoparticles collected and transported electrons, which efficiently separated photogenerâ€� ated electronâ€�hole pairs, effectively lengthening the lifetime of charge carriers, as shown in Fig. 13. Furthermore, the unique twoâ€�dimensional planar structure of GR allowed photocatalytic reactions to take place not only on the surface of the semiconâ€� ductor, but also on the GR sheet, which greatly increased the reaction space. Jia et al. [73] synthesized a CdS/Nâ€�doped GR (Nâ€�GR) heterogeneous composite with high hydrogen producâ€� tion activity under visible light irradiation. The optimum amount of Nâ€�GR was ca. 2 wt%. Their found that a proper juncâ€� tion structure between Nâ€�GR and CdS was crucial for high phoâ€� tocatalytic activity because Nâ€�GR could protect CdS from phoâ€� tocorrosion and also act as a charge collector to promote the separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers, increasing hydrogen evolution. Fig. 13. Schematic illustration of charge separation and transfer in a CdS/GR system under visible light [24]. CHEN Jianwei et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 621â€“640 Bismuthâ€�based photocatalysts (such as BiVO4) show great potential as visible light photocatalysts, and have received conâ€� siderable attention recently. Incorporating GR into bisâ€� muthâ€�based photocatalysts may further improve their photoâ€� catalytic activity. Ng et al. [74] prepared a BiVO4â€�RGO compoâ€� site that exhibited a 10â€�fold enhancement for photoelectroâ€� chemical splitting of water compared with pure BiVO4. This improvement was attributed to the fact that the lifetime of electrons was extended because the electrons excited in BiVO4 could be rapidly injected into RGO at the site of generation. The intimate contact between BiVO4 particles and RGO also conâ€� tributed to the enhanced photoresponse of the BiVO4â€�RGO composite. The preparation of composite photocatalysts consisting of a single semiconductor and GR and their activity for hydrogen production from water splitting are well researched. Some scholars predicted that better synergic effects could be obâ€� tained by incorporating GR with multiple semiconductors, which could further improve their photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production by splitting water. Iwase et al. [75] reâ€� garded RGO as the electron conductor in a twoâ€�photon system, replacing traditional redox electron pairs such as I â€“ /IO 3â€“ and Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ . Under irradiation by visible light, electrons photoexâ€� cited from the VB of BiVO4 (the photocatalyst used to produce O2) were transferred to the CB of Ru/SrTiO3:Rh (the photoâ€� catalyst used to produce H2) via RGO. Simultaneously, the elecâ€� trons in Ru/SrTiO3:Rh reduced water to H2, and the holes in BiVO4 oxidized water to O2, forming a complete water splitting cycle. After adding RGO to the twoâ€�photon system, the producâ€� tion of hydrogen was tripled compared with that in the absence of RGO. They proposed a mechanism where RGO, possessing high electron conductivity and low hydrophobicity, could meâ€� diate electron transport in the twoâ€�photon system, improving the separation efficiency of photogenerated electronâ€�hole pairs. Hou et al. [76] successfully synthesized CdS@TaON coreâ€�shell composites and CdS@TaON coupled with GO (GOâ€�CdS@TaON). CdS@TaON coreâ€�shell composites showed a rate of hydrogen production of 306 Î¼mol/h under 420 nm monochromatic light. This rate was further increased to 633 Î¼mol/h with a high quantum efficiency of 31% when the GOâ€�CdS@TaON composite was coupled with 1 wt% GO and 0.4 wt% Pt (about 141 times higher than that of TaON alone). This high photocatalytic activâ€� ity for production of hydrogen was ascribed first to the presâ€� ence of CdS nanocrystals that altered the energy levels of the CB and VB in the coupled semiconductor system, and second to GO aiding electron collection and transport to effectively lengthen the lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers in the CdS@TaON composites. Xiang et al. [77] used MoS2 and GR as coâ€�catalysts in a TiO2 nanoparticle photocatalytic system. The TiO2/MoS2/GR composite exhibited a high production rate of hydrogen of 165.3 Î¼mol/h when it contained 0.5 wt% GR. When the coâ€�catalyst contained 5.0 wt% GR, the apparent quantum efficiency reached 9.7% at 365 nm. The proposed mechanism for the transfer of electrons in the TiO2/MoS2/GR system was that the photoexcited electrons located in the CB of TiO2 could be transferred not only to the MoS2 nanosheets but also to the C atoms in the GR sheets, which could effectively reduce H + to produce H2. 4.3. Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to produce organic fuels CO2 is widely recognized as a greenhouse gas that has caused global warming and other environmental problems, so it cannot be ignored. As a result, research on CO2 activation and chemical fixation has intensified. Semiconductor photocatalysts have been used to fix CO2 and reduce CO2 into organic fuels. Most of these studies have focused on the conversion of CO2 to C1 compounds. Hoffmann et al. [78] summarized the producâ€� tion of C x compounds via photocatalytic reduction of CO2. The mechanism of CO2 reduction by semiconductor photocatalysts is shown in Fig. 14. Liang et al. [79] combined TiO2 (P25) with two kinds of GR with different defect densities to obtain composite photocataâ€� lysts and used them to reduce CO2 to CH4. The size and content of defects in GR had a large effect on the photocatalytic activity of the composites. The composite photocatalyst that exhibited the highest photoreductive activity under UV illumination produced 4.5 times more CH4 than a P25 film. Under visible illumination, the highest photoreductive activity was achieved by another composite, which produced 7.2 times more CH4 than pure P25. They proposed that introduction of GR inâ€� creased the mean free path of photogenerated electrons conâ€� siderably and lengthened the lifetime of electrons and holes through the effective separation of charges. Tu et al. [80] fabriâ€� cated hollow spheres consisting of alternating layers of titania (Ti0.91O2) nanosheets (TNS) and GR using a layerâ€�byâ€�layer asâ€� sembly technique with poly(methyl methacrylate) beads as sacrificial templates. These hollow spheres were used to phoâ€� tocatalytically reduce CO2 to CO and CH4. The composite hollow spheres exhibited higher activity than pure TNS and bare GR. One of the major reasons for the large enhancement in photoâ€� catalytic activity might be the compact stacking of ultrathin TNS with GR, which allowed rapid transfer of photogenerated electrons from TNS to GR to lengthen the lifetime of charge carriers. 4.4. Photocatalytic sterilization Semiconductor photocatalysts are strongly oxidizing, nonâ€� toxic, photostable and low maintenance, making them promisâ€� ing for sterilization like chlorination and UV irradiation. Most semiconductor photocatalysts can be used as bactericidal or Fig. 14.Â Schematic representation of CO2 reduction on the surface of a semiconductor.Â CHEN Jianwei et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 621â€“640 antimicrobial agents under suitable illumination. When GR is incorporated into semiconductor systems, the bactericidal or antimicrobial activity should be further improved. Liu et al. [31] synthesized TiO2 nanorod/GO and TiO2 nanoâ€� particle/GO composite photocatalysts to sterilize E. coli. Elecâ€� tron microscope (EM) images of E. coli before and after solar irradiation are presented in Fig. 15. The photocatalytic inactiâ€� vation of E. coli reached almost 100% with GO but was very low without GO. This is because GO accelerated the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and effectively suppressed their recombination, increasing the antibacterial properties of the composites. Akhavan et al. [81] evaluated the visible light photocatalytic performance of a WO3/GO composite film for the photoinactiâ€� vation of bacteriophage MS2 viruses by measuring the breakâ€� age of protein capsids and the efflux of viral RNA enveloped in the protein layer of the viruses. Photoinactivation of the viruses on the surface of the WO3/GO composite film resulted in nearly complete destruction of the viral protein and a sharp increase in the RNA efflux after light irradiation at room temperature for 3 h. Moreover, the reduction in RNA efflux was less than 10% after 20 measurement cycles and each cycle lasted 60 h, indiâ€� cating WO3/GO possesses excellent photostability. 4.5. Other photocatalytic applications In addition to the four applications described above, semiâ€� conductor/GR composite photocatalysts can also be used to fabricate batteries and capacitors. Yang et al. [82] used a TiO2/GR composite as an electrode in dyeâ€�sensitized solar cells. They found that incorporating GR into the TiO2 electrode inâ€� creased the rate of faster electron transport, lowered that of recombination, and increased the shortâ€�circuit current density by 45% without sacrificing the openâ€�circuit voltage. Furtherâ€� more, the total conversion efficiency was increased by 39% compared with the nanocrystalline TiO2 photoanode. Recently, Fan et al. [83] improved the photoelectric properties of dyeâ€�sensitized solar cells by using a TNS/GR composite film as the anode. Guo et al. [84] prepared a novel layered composite of CdS quantum dots (QD s ) and GR by layerâ€�byâ€�layer assembly that was then incorporated in a solar cell. {QDS/GR}8 exhibited the highest photoelectric conversion efficiency (16%) of a quantum dot/GR solar cell to date (others are â‰¤ 5%). Li and coworkers [47] prepared mesoporous anatase TiO2 nanoâ€� spheres anchored on GR sheets by in situ growth and then mixed the composite with carbon black and poly(vinyl difluoâ€� ride) with a fixed ratio. The mixture was pasted onto copper foil and used as a working electrode. The composite showed substantial improvement in the specific capacity of lithium, increasing from 1 C to 50 C. More strikingly, the specific capacâ€� ity of the composite at a rate of 50 C was as high as 97 (mAÂ·h)/g, which was six times higher than that of the reference TiO2 nanospheres. Qiu et al. [85] synthesized a TiO2/RGO nanocomposite that was used as the active anode in lithium ion batteries to evaluate its charge/discharge performance. Batâ€� teries containing the TiO2/RGO nanocomposite showed more stable loop performance, greater reversible capacity and higher capacitance ratio than those lacking the composite because of the synergic effect between TiO2 and RGO. Ng et al. [58] used a TiO2/GR nanocomposite as the photoanode of a photoelectroâ€� chemical cell. The photocurrent was enhanced by nearly 90% in the cell containing GR compared with that without because of the role of GR in electron collection and transport. Semiconductor/GR composite photocatalysts can also cataâ€� lyze selective transformations of organic compounds [86â€“90]. Zhang et al. [88] prepared a TiO2/GR composite photocatalyst with high photocatalytic performance by decreasing the numâ€� ber of defects in GR. The selective transformation of benzyl alcohol into benzaldehyde was increased by 21% using lowâ€�defect GR in the composite photocatalyst. They also conâ€� structed a ternary nanocomposite composed of CdS/TiO2/GR to enhance the photoactivity toward the selective oxidation of alcohols to corresponding aldehydes under visible light illumiâ€� nation. The improved photocatalytic performance of CdS/TiO2/GR was ascribed to the combined effects of the longâ€� er lifetime of photogenerated electronâ€�hole pairs, faster rate of interfacial charge transfer and larger surface area of this comâ€� posite compared with reference compounds [89]. 5. Conclusions and prospects The excellent conductivity, flexibility, chemical stability, high specific surface area and unique singleâ€�layer twoâ€�dimensional planar structure of GR make it a more attracâ€� tive multifunctional material to carry and transfer charges than CNTs and fullerenes. Introducing GR into semiconductor phoâ€� (a) (b) (c) (d) Fig. 15. SEM images of E. coli before solar irradiation without (a) and with (b) GO sheets; and after solar irradiation for 2 h without (c) and with (d) GO sheets [31]. CHEN Jianwei et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 621â€“640 tocatalysts can improve their photocatalytic efficiency and has broad application prospects in photocatalytic decomposition of organic pollutants, photocatalytic splitting of water to produce H2, photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to produce organic fuels, and photocatalytic sterilization. However, some fundamental problems need to be resolved that are worthy of further reâ€� search. These include: (1) Determining the transfer path and mechanisms of phoâ€� togenerated charge carriers. Almost all papers in this field reâ€� ported that GR can increase the rate of transfer of photogenerâ€� ated electrons, effectively suppress recombination and improve photocatalytic efficiency. However, these conclusions were mainly deduced from the experimental results of photocatalytic reactions, and no direct experimental evidence was obtained. In addition, some scholars thought that semiconductor/GR composite photocatalysts behaved the same as other semiconâ€� ductor/ carbon allotrope composites regarding the enhanceâ€� ment mechanisms of the photocatalytic activity of semiconâ€� ductors. For example, Fu et al. [91] found that a TiO2/CNT composite exhibited almost the same photocatalytic efficiency as a TiO2/GR one by comparing the photocatalytic decomposiâ€� tion of MB. On the basis of this result, they speculated that GR enhanced photocatalytic activity in the same way as other carâ€� bon allotropes. Therefore, some of the more powerful analytiâ€� cal tools, such as timeâ€�resolved transient absorption spectrosâ€� copy, UV photoelectron spectroscopy and fluorescence emisâ€� sion spectra, need to be used to examine the transfer of photoâ€� generated charge carriers between semiconductors and GR, the band changes after composite formation, and changes in the number of charge carriers to provide direct evidence for GR promoting the separation and transport of photogenerated charges [92]. (2) Designing the interface in semiconductor/GR composite photocatalysts. Electrons need to be transferred rapidly through the semiconductor/GR interface to enhance photoâ€� conversion efficiency. Selecting single or multiple semiconducâ€� tors with energy band structures that match those of GR, and designing the interface between the semiconductor and GR through surface modification or coâ€�catalysts, will help to imâ€� prove photocatalysis and the conversion of solar energy. Howâ€� ever, studies examining the design and adjustment of the interâ€� face in semiconductor/GR composites are still very rare at present, so this requires further research. (3) Controlled preparation of highâ€�quality GR and semiconâ€� ductors. The physicochemical properties of GR, such as size, surface morphology and number of defects, as well as the characteristics of the semiconductor itself, including crystal type, size and morphology, have direct effects on the preparaâ€� tion and final performance of composite photocatalysts. Therefore, it is worth investigating the controlled preparation of highâ€�quality GR and semiconductors, which is needed to synthesize highâ€�performance composite photocatalysts. (4) Exploring new methods to prepare composites. The inâ€� terfaces formed by the interaction between GR and semiconâ€� ductors have a large effect on the photocatalytic properties of composites, but the techniques commonly used at present are only traditional hydro/solvothermal, solution mixing and in situ growth methods. The composite photocatalysts obtained from these methods usually cause semiconductors to be carried on the surface of GR or combine with GR in a simple physical way, which not only destroys the unique twoâ€�dimensional sinâ€� gle atomic layered structure of GR but also leads to weak interâ€� actions between GR and the semiconductor because their comâ€� bination is not optimized. As a result, an effective synergic inâ€� teraction between GR and semiconductors is not achieved. Therefore, pursuing new methods to prepare composites with chemical bonds without destroying the planar structure of GR to obtain semiconductor/GR composite photocatalysts with good morphology and excellent photocatalytic performance is an important direction for research. (5) Developing new composite materials. Most research to date has focused on the combination of known semiconductors and GR. The combination of new semiconductors or other phoâ€� tocatalysts with GR is also worth attempting. Other applications apart from those in the fields of environment and energy should also be explored to maximize the value of semiconducâ€� tor/GR composite photocatalysts. In short, the growing problems of environmental pollution and energy shortage mean that semiconductor/GR composite photocatalysts as a potential solution to these issues should be explored further to fully tap their potential academic and apâ€� plied value.

Tel: +86-592-6190762 Graphene is a new material with a single-layer laminar structure of carbon atoms that possesses favorable physical and chemical properties such as high electrical conductivity, high chemical stability, and large specific surface area. Combining graphene with semiconductors to form composite photocatalysts can extend its light absorption edge, improve the migration rate of charge carriers, and enhance the adsorption capacity of contaminants. The unique two-dimensional planar structure of graphene endows composite photocatalysts with many excellent properties. Herein, the properties of graphene, semiconductor, and composite photocatalysts are first introduced. The various preparation methods of semiconductor/graphene composite photocatalysts are then presented, and the mechanisms behind enhanced photocatalysis are summarized. Four typical applications of composite photocatalysts: elimination of organic pollutants, hydrogen production, organic fuel production via CO2 reduction, and photocatalytic sterilization, are described in detail. Finally, the direction of future research on semiconductor/graphene composite photocatalysts is explored. 摘要 首先分析了石墨烯和半导体光催化剂的特点, 14;以及二者复合后可能具有的优越性质, 14;接着介绍了石墨烯和半导体复合光催化剂的制备方法, 14;归纳了石墨烯增强半导体光催化的机理, 14;然后阐述了复合光催化剂在降解有机污染物、光催化分解水产氢、光催化还原CO2制有机燃料和光催化灭菌四个典型的应用, 14;最后对半导体/石墨烯复合光催化剂未来的发展趋势提出了展望.

        "dc:description": "Graphene is a new material with a single-layer laminar structure of carbon atoms that possesses favorable physical and chemical properties such as high electrical conductivity, high chemical stability, and large specific surface area. Combining graphene with semiconductors to form composite photocatalysts can extend its light absorption edge, improve the migration rate of charge carriers, and enhance the adsorption capacity of contaminants. The unique two-dimensional planar structure of graphene endows composite photocatalysts with many excellent properties. Herein, the properties of graphene, semiconductor, and composite photocatalysts are first introduced. The various preparation methods of semiconductor/graphene composite photocatalysts are then presented, and the mechanisms behind enhanced photocatalysis are summarized. Four typical applications of composite photocatalysts: elimination of organic pollutants, hydrogen production, organic fuel production via CO2 reduction, and photocatalytic sterilization, are described in detail. Finally, the direction of future research on semiconductor/graphene composite photocatalysts is explored.",
