The catalysts were characterized by means of XRD, H2-TPR and CO-TPD studies. The CuO/CeO2 catalysts exhibit high catalytic activity in CO oxidation, showing markedly enhanced catalytic activities due to the combined effect of copper oxide and cerium dioxide. The activity of the CuO/CeO2 (15%) catalyst prepared by impregnation is higher than that prepared by co-precipitation. CeO2 promotes the hydrogen reduction activity of copper, so that CuO/CeO2 catalysts show a different behavior with respect to pure CuO. Two reducible copper species were observed in all CuO/CeO2 catalysts. CO-TPD experiments revealed that CuO/CeO2 catalysts can adsorb CO, while pure CuO and CeO2 cannot. Combining the results of TPR, TPD study, and the catalytic activity measurements, it is proposed that the well dispersed CuO which can adsorb CO and which is reducible at low-temperature is responsible for low-temperature CO oxidation. The bulk CuO which cannot adsorb CO and which is reducible at high-temperature contributes little to the oxidation activity. 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction CO oxidation catalysts with high activity at or near room temperature are useful for several applications including closed-cycle CO2 lasers and air purification [1]. Many different catalysts have been prepared and tested for low-temperature CO oxidation activity. For example, noble metal catalysts such as Pd/SnO2, Pt/ SnO2, Au/MnOx, Au/c~-Fe203 and Au/Co304 have been demonstrated to be very effective in CO oxida- *Corresponding author.

Due to the limited availability of precious metals, attention has been given to base metals as catalysts, especially copper oxide [6,7]. During CO oxidation, copper oxide can exhibit activities per unit surface area similar to those of noble-metal catalysts such as platinum [8]. Cerium oxide has been widely used in the automotive three-way catalytic converter as an oxygen storage medium and thermal stabilizer. The interaction of ceria with precious metals (Pd, Pt, Rh) and its effect on catalytic activity have been intensively studied [9]. Lin and co-workers [ 10,11 ] found that Cu-Ce-O composite catalyst is active for 122 M.-F. Luo et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 162 (1997) 121-13l carbon monoxide oxidation. Complete oxidation of carbon monoxide occurs at 100 in air. Cu-Ce-O composite catalyst also showed excellent resistance to water poisoning. By means of XPS and XRD Linet al. [10,11] suggested that a strong inter- action exists between the transition metal and cerium oxide. The present work is concerned with TPR and TPD studies of CuO/CeO2 catalysts and with oxidation activity for carbon monoxide. Our aim is to gain some direct evidence of the synergism between CuO and CeO2. Such information may aid the devel- opment of CuO/CeO2 catalysts which can replace noble metal catalysts for the low-temperature CO oxidation. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation of catalysts CeO2 was prepared by thermal decomposition of cerous nitrate, Ce(NO3)3, for 4 h at 650 in air. The BET surface area of the obtained CeO2 material is 55 m2 g-1. The supported CuO/CeO2 catalysts were prepared by the conventional wet impregnation method using an aqueous solution of Cu(NO3)2. Pre- pared samples were dried overnight in an oven at 120 and then heated in air for 4 h at 650. The loading of CuO is 0.25 ~ 15%, respectively. The CuO/ CeO2 (CuO 15%) samples were also calcined at 400, 550, 800 and 950 to examine the influence of calcination temperature. The catalyst prepared by the impregnation method is denoted as CuOICeO2 (X%). For the comparison, catalysts were also prepared by coprecipitating Cu(NO3)2 and Ce(NO3)3 solutions by adding NaOH. The precipitate was washed with deionized water and then dried for about 5 h at 120. The dried sample was heated in air for 4 h at 650. This catalystis denoted as CuO (15%)-CEO2. Nacontent of the catalyst is 96.25 ~tg/g by atomic adsorption spectrometry. 2.2. He-TPR TPR measurements were made in a flow system. 10 mg catalyst was pretreated in air at 500 and placed in a TPR cell at 20, into which H2-N2 (5 : 95) mixed gas was introduced. The water pro- duced by the reduction was trapped on a 5A molecular sieve. The temperature of the sample was programmed to rise at a constant rate of 20/min and the amount of H2 uptake during the reduction was measured by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). 2.3. CO-TPD TPD experiments were performed after CO adsorp- tion on samples. A 100 mg sample was loaded in a quartz microreactor and heated in He at 650 for 0.5 h, then cooled to 20 in a flow He (40 ml min 1). Adsorption of CO (>99.5%) was performed at 20 by injecting several consecutive pulses of 1 ml until the amount of CO of effluent stream is constant (with TCD). Excess of adsorbate was removed by allowing the sample to remain in He flow until no significant amount of adsorbate could be detected (approximately 0.5 h). The sample was then ramped to 500 at a linear heating rate of 20 min-1 in flowing He (40 ml min 1). The analysis of the effluent gases (CO and CO2) was performed with a mass spectro- meter (ZHD-OIS instrument). The amount of CO adsorbed on the catalysts was measured by a pulse method at 20. The pretreat- ment was the same with CO-TPD. 0.5 ml of CO was injected with a syringe repeatedly until no adsorption was observed, the amount of catalyst was chosen so as to allow more than 10% of the first injected CO to be adsorbed. The amount of CO adsorbed was calculated from the difference between amounts of injected and eluted CO. 2.4. Activity measurements Catalytic activity measurements were carried out in a fixed bed reactor (0.6 cm i.d.) using 150 mg of catalyst of 20~60 mesh size. The total gas flow rate was set at 80 SCCM. The gas consists of 2.4% CO and 1.2% 02 in N2. The catalysts were directly exposed to 80 SCCM of reaction gas as the reactor temperature stabilized at reaction temperature, without any pre- treatment. The analyses of the reactor effluent were performed with an on-line SP-2304 model gas chro- matography with a TCD. M.-E Luo et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 162 (1997) 121-131 123 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Temperature-programmed reduction The TPR profiles for these CuO/CeO2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 1. The reduction of pure CeO2 began at 400 (not shown in Fig. 1), and the signal of TPR is much weaker than that of CuO/CeO2 (0.25 %) catalyst. The reduction profile of pure CuO is characterized by a single peak at 380. A two-step reduction profile is observed for all CuO/CeO2 catalysts, indicating the existence of two CuO species. TPR peak temperature of CuO/CeO2 catalyst is much lower than that of pure CuO. The intensity of the low-temperature peak increases with CuO loading from 0.25% to 3.0%.

Luo et al./Applied Catalysis A.\" General 162 (1997) 121-131 15%, the intensity of the low-temperature peak does not change. The low-temperature peak position is unchanged with increased CuO loading around 160. By contrast, the position of the high-tempera- ture peak shifts to higher temperature with increasing CuO loading; the intensity also increases with the loading. Lin et al. suggested that bulk CuO can be easily dissolved in nitric acid and bulk CuO particles in catalyst were removed by immersing the sample in nitric acid. In this work, the CuO/CeO2 (15%) catalyst was immersed in concentrated nitric acid (12ml HNO3/g catalyst) for 40 h and then filtered, washed with deionized water and dried at 200 or 650 for 1 h. The TPR profiles of the catalyst after these treatments are also shown in Fig. 1. The peak area of the catalyst treated with HNO3 was significantly less than that of the untreated ones. The copper content of treated catalyst is about 0.9% by chemical analysis. This indicates that a large number of Cu atoms in catalyst was removed by this process. At the same calcination temperature, the same TPR peak is also observed with different immersed time (4~40 h). The temperature of TPR peak of the catalyst (by immersed) at 650 calcination is much lower than that at 200, similar to CuO/CeO2 (1%) catalyst. No lower temperature peak (about 160) is observed in the catalyst (acid treated) dried at 200. This indicates that the higher temperature calcination made copper oxide disperse well. Therefore, we believe that the finely dispersed CuO can also be dissolved in nitric acid. Therefore, we propose that there are two reducible copper species in CuO/CeO2 catalysts.

Another is represented by larger particle bulk CuO, they reduce at higher temperature. From Fig. 1, overlapping peak for CuO (15%)-CEO2 catalyst can be seen. The temperature of the high-temperature peak of CuO (15%)-CEO2 is similar to CuO/CeO2 (15%). But the temperature of the low-temperature peak of the former is higher than that of the latter. We suppose that a small amount of Na remainder (96.25 ktg/g) and prepare method cause the higher shift of the low- temperature peak. 3.2. TPD of CO For CO-TPD studies several doses of CO pules were injected until excess CO was detected in He stream and the adsorbed species were then desorbed by raising the temperature. Almost no CO (m/e=28) is observed during CO-TPD. TPD spectra of CO2 after CO adsorption at 20 are given in Fig. 2. From Fig. 2, we can see that there is only one CO2 desorp- tion peak on CuO]CeO2 catalyst at about I I0, with no peak on pure CuO or CeO2. This indicates that almost no CO is adsorbed on pure CuO and CeO2 surfaces. The area of CO2 desorbed peak increases with increased CuO loading from 0.25% to 3.0%. However at CuO loading higher than 3.0%, the area of CO2 desorbed peak no longer increased. The CO adsorption amount of the CuO/CeO2 (15%), CuO/ CeO2 (5%), CuO/CeO2 (3%), CuO/CeO2 (1%), CuO/CeO2 (0.25%), pure CuO and CeO2 was 5.0, 4.9, 4.8, 3.3, 1.2, 0.05 and 0.03 mug, respectively. The adsorption amount of pure CuO and CeO2 is very small. The CO adsorption amount of the catalysts is consistent with the CO2 desorption amount.

The plot in Fig. 3 show perfect straight line between the area of low-temperature TPR peak with the area of CO2 desorbed peak. Almost no CO was adsorbed on the catalyst treated by nitric acid dried at 200, but this catalyst dried at 650 can adsorb CO; the area of CO2 adsorption peak is similar to CuO/CeO2 (1%) catalyst (Fig. 2). It is evident these CO2 peaks are due to bidentate carbonates species produced by interaction of CO with lattice oxygen in the finely dispersed CuO. Therefore, the CO adsorp- tion site of CuO/CeO2 catalyst is the finely dispersed CuO species. 3.3. Catalytic activity for CO oxidation Fig. 4 shows the light-off curves over CuO/CeO2 catalysts prepared by impregnation. None of these catalysts were pretreated before running the reaction. This is particularly important in practical applications where pretreatment is not possible or when the cata- lysts must be stored in or exposed to air before use. At each reaction temperature, the reaction was continued for about 1 h to achieve steady-state activity. From Fig. 4, it can be seen that the activity of pure CuO (thermal decomposition of Cu(NO3)2 at 650 for 4 h) and CeO2 is quite low, and the activity of the CuO/ CeO2 catalysts is much higher than that of the pure CuO and CeO2. The light-off temperature of CuO (15%)-CEO2 catalyst prepared by coprecipitation is about 85 higher than that of CuO/CeO2 (15%) prepared by impregnation. This indicates that activity of the supported catalyst is higher than that of copre- cipitation catalyst. The activity of CuO/CeO2 catalysts increases with CuO loading from 0.25% to 3%, then remains constant for a higher loading of CuO (from 3% to 15%). The order of CO oxidation activity of CuO/CeO2 is consistent with intensity of the low- temperature peak (Fig. 1) and CO2 adsorption peak (Fig. 3) of catalysts. This also indicated that CO oxidation activity is related to reduction temperature of finely dispersed CuO species. The easier the reduc- tion of the finely dispersed CuO species is, the higher the oxidation activity of catalyst. The light-off tem- perature of CuO/CeO2 (>3%) is about 60 lower than that of the Cu-Ce-O composite catalysts reported in the literature [10]. Since pure CuO and CeO2 support has a very low activity, there is synergistic interaction between the CuO and CeO2 support that is 1 O0 ,L~.~ll~-~r~.

Luo et al./Applied Catalysis A.\" General 162 (1997) 121-131 responsible for the high activity of carbon monoxide oxidation at low temperature. Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns of these catalysts. At low CuO loading (<5%) no visible CuO crystal phases can be observed. As the CuO loading increased, the crystal phase of CuO becomes apparent. On the basis of the activity results, we propose that only a small amount of copper (3%) is needed to form active sites for the oxidation reaction, and that excess copper forms bulk CuO particles contributing little to the activity. Lin and co-workers [10,11] suggested that the activity of Cu-Ce-O cata- lyst derives primarily from the combination of finely dispersed copper-cerium oxide system, while the CuO particles have negligible contribution. The data shown in Fig. 4 are consistent with this assertion. The light- off temperature of the catalyst treated nitric acid at 650 calcination was about 70, which is much lower than that at 200 calcination. On the basis of the catalytic activity, TPD, and TPR results, we con- clude that the finely dispersed CuO species that can absorb CO mainly contribute to the catalytic activity. Only a small amount of copper oxide (around 3%) is needed to promote the CO oxidation activity of CeO2, and excess copper forms bulk CuO that cannot adsorb CO and contributes little to the activity. Deo et al. [12] reported that bridge-bonded vana- dium oxide, such as Zr-O-V is more reducible than that of terminal bond oxygen (V=O). Brogan et al. [ 13] pointed out that when Pt is supported on CeO> the surface oxygen can be easily removed at low tem- perature owing to Pt-O-Ce linkage. More recently, Dow et al. [14] pointed out that the shared oxygen ion Zr-O-Cu can be reduced more easily than unshared capping oxygen ion. Therefore, we suggest that the low-temperature peak in Fig. 1 is similar to the shared oxygen ion Ce-O-Cu the shared oxygen ion can be 100 ,-,t 80 0 0 o 60 e- 0 m 40 e.- 0 0 2O 0 50 60 00 50 0 1 00 200 300 I I I I 70 80 90 1 00 Temperature() Fig. 7.

Luo et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 162 (1997) 121-131 129 reduced more easily than unshared capping oxygen ion. The shared capping oxygen ion is also adsorption sites of CO [15]. The shared oxygen ions reacts with CO to produce CO2 with rose desorption temperature. Jernigan et al. [16] pointed out that CO oxidation over CuO catalyst belongs to a redox mechanism, the rate- limiting is the reduction of CuO by CO. Based on the above discussion, we attribute the enhanced catalytic activity of CuO/CeO2 to the shared oxygen ion Ce-O- Cu, which can provide active oxygen species and CO adsorption sites for CO oxidation. The CO oxidation activity of CuO/CeO2 (15%) catalyst as function of reaction time is shown in Fig. 6. The activity of the CuO/CeO2 catalyst appar- ently does not decay with reaction time. The activity of this catalyst is close to Au/MnOx catalyst, and clearly superior to the Pt/SnOx catalyst reported in the literature [5]. 3.4. Effect of calcination temperature Fig. 7 shows that the effect of calcination tempera- ture of the CuO/CeO2 (15%) catalyst on light-off temperature of CO oxidation. The light-off tempera- ture reaches a minimum at 650 calcination. The activity of the catalyst calcined 650 is the highest. After 950 calcination, the light-off temperature markedly increases.

The CO adsorption amount of CuO/CeO2 (15%) catalyst cal- cined at 800 and 950 was 1.8 and 0.20 ml/g, respectively. After 950 calcination the double TPR peak disappeared and TPR profile is characterized by single peak centered at about 380 (Fig. 8), and CO2 desorption peak also disappeared (Fig. 9). Compari- son of Figs. 8 and 9 indicates that the light-off tem- perature of CO oxidation is consistent with the temperature of low-temperature TPR peak and the area of CO2 desorbed peak. This also indicates that easier reduction CuO species on catalyst is a possible active site of CO oxidation, which can adsorb CO. On the basis of the above results, we attributed the enhanced catalytic activity to synergistic interaction of CuO and CeO2, which results in the easier reduced CuO species and CO adsorption on CuO/CeO2 cata- lyst. 4. Conclusions CuO/CeO2 catalysts of different CuO loading have been prepared and tested for low-temperature carbon monoxide in stoichiometric mixtures of carbon mon- oxide and oxygen. The CuO/CeO2 catalyst prepared via impregnation show higher CO oxidation activity than that of the Cu-Ce-O composite catalyst, and do M.-F. Luo et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 162 (1997) 121-131 131 not exhibit deactivation of catalytic activity. The finely dispersed CuO on CeO2 is responsible for low-tem- perature CO oxidation, and the bulk CuO contributes little to the activity. The TPR investigation of CuO/ CeO2 catalyst showed that CeO2 promotes the reduc- tion of CuO species. The observation of two reduction peaks in H2-TPR suggests the presence of two differ- ent CuO species. The low-temperature TPR peak of CuO/CeO2 is attributed to the finely dispersed CuO species that can adsorb CO, and the high-temperature peak is attributed to the bulk CuO species which cannot adsorb CO.
