Applied Catalysis A: General, 523 (2016) 54 Investigating the CrOx/Al2O3 dehydrogenation catalyst model: I. identiï¬� cation and stability evaluation of the Cr species on the fresh and equilibrated catalysts Vladimir Z. Fridman, Rong Xing, Michael Severance Clariant Corporation, Louisville, KY, 40209, United States Initial operation of fresh CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst caused restructuring of unstable Cr species leading to the formation of equilibrated one. A new Cr6+ species, aluminum-chromium-chromate, was reported on the fresh and equilibrated CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst surface for the first time. At least five surface Cr species were identified, and their stability were evaluated and compared between the fresh and equilibrated catalysts. A new catalyst model for the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst has been established and can be reasonably applied to the commercial catalysts.

Box 524, Auckland Park 2006, South Africa Synthesis of the Pd-nanoparticles using sodium borohydride on graphitic carbon nitride (g-CN) support. Graphitic carbon nitride supported palladium nanoparticles (Pd-g-CN) has been used as an efficient catalyst for the chemo-selective reduction of aromatic nitro-compounds in presence of a mild reducing agent. The catalyst showed high recyclability and can also be stored for a long time at ambient condition maintaining the high catalytic efficiency. The optimized reaction condition is useful to prepare two new compounds, such as, 2, 6-diaminophenol and 4-(1H-indole-1-yl) aniline, not previously reported in the literature.

This Mn2Co3Ox catalyst has an excellent stability. Surface area and the surface Mn4+/3+ and Co3+ amounts are the key parameters. Mn/Co affects its phase constitution, surface area and surface Mn valence state. Applied Catalysis A: General, 523 (2016) 97 Pre-reduction and K loading effects on noble metal free Co-system catalyst for water gas shift reaction Tomohiro Majima, Eugene Kono, Shuhei Ogo, Yasushi Sekine Applied Chemistry, Waseda University, 3-4-1, Okubo, Shinjuku, Tokyo 169-8555 Japan Noble metal free Co-system catalyst for WGS was investigated. K/Co3O4 catalyst shows no WGS activity without pre-treatment. K/Co3O4 catalyst pre-reduced by syngas showed high and stable, robust activity. Pre-reduction by syngas can form Co2C as active sites effectively. K-loading suppresses excess reduction of Co-oxide to metallic Co by electron donation. Applied Catalysis A: General, 523 (2016) 92 Transformation of methyl laurate into lauryl alcohol over a Ruâ€“Snâ€“Mo/C catalyst by using zerovalent iron and water as an in situ hydrogen source Kunimasa Sagata, Mina Hirose, Yoshiaki Hirano, Yuichi Kita Department of Chemical Science and Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, Kobe University, Kobe 657-8501, Japan We used hydrogen derived from a reaction of zerovalent iron and water as a novel in-situ hydrogen donor system. The Ru-based catalyst with the Fe/H2O system efficiently produced lauryl alcohol via lauric acid as an intermediate. We hope that this Fe/H2O reaction system will encourage the use of more eco-friendly hydro-genation reaction systems.

Bi-functional catalysts based on palladium and gold nanoparticles supported onto active nanocrystalline TS-1 zeolite are prepared and characterized. Active and reusable catalysts for the direct PO production from H2, O2 and C3 = with the in-situ generation of intermediate H2O2 are evaluated. One-pot two-step consecutive process is carried out using only one stable catalyst with high selectivity for PO production. Modification of suitable reaction parameters, working under safety supercritical CO2 conditions, allowed the optimization of catalytic results.

Gusevskaya Departamento de QuÃ­mica, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, 31270-901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil Rhodium catalyzed hydrofomylation of -caryophyllene using PPh3 as the ligand and ethanol as the solvent has been developed. The reaction gives the monoaldehyde derived from the endocyclic double bond in ca. 70% yield along with the dialdehyde. A combined GC yield for these two major hydroformylation products was up to 85%. The hydroformylation of the naturally occurring -caryophyllene represents an attractive entry to new fragrant compounds.

Structural characterization by means of X-Ray and neutron powder diffraction revealed rhombohedral symmetry for all samples (space group R-3c). A decrease in unit cell size occurs on increasing Al-content. The Al-substitution alters the redox properties, as shown by flowing titrations. A correlation between the redox properties of the perovskite type oxide and the product evolution during reaction of the Rh-promoted oxides with CH4 was observed. The possibility of tuning the product evolution through the redox properties of the oxides (Al-substitution) was successfully demonstrated.

Spent TiO2/ -Al2O3 photocatalyst has been regenerated via desul-furization. Using hydrogen at 500 C in 1 h could completely regenerate the spent photocatalyst. Applied Catalysis A: General, 523 (2016) 294 Hydrogen production by steam reforming of ethanol on a RhPt/CeO2/SiO2 catalyst: Synergistic effect of the Si:Ce ratio on the catalyst performance Bernay Cifuentes, MarÃ­a HernÃ¡ndez, Sonia Monsalve, Martha Cobo Energy, Materials, and Environment Laboratory, Department of Chemical Engineering, Universidad de La Sabana, Campus Universitario Puente del ComÃºn, Km. 7 Autopista Norte, BogotÃ¡, Colombia Catalyst and operational conditions that maximized H2 yield from the steam reforming of ethanol was assessed. The new RhPt/CeO2-SiO2 (Si = 33 mol%) catalyst provided 30% more H2 compared to the reference RhPt/CeO2 catalyst. SiO2 in RhPt/CeO2 alters catalyst crystalline phase, basicity, surface area, and active particle size, increasing H2 yield. The new RhPt/CeO2-SiO2 (Si = 33 mol%) catalyst was active and stable during 72 h of continuous and startup/shutdown operation. Applied Catalysis A: General, 523 (2016) 283 Structure and activity of TiO2/FeO co-doped carbon spheres for adsorptive-photocatalytic performance of complete toluene removal from aquatic environment Ajit Sharma, Byeong-Kyu Lee Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Ulsan, Nam-gu, Daehak ro 93, Ulsan 680-749, Republic of Korea Photocatalytic carbon spheres were synthesized by doping of TiO2-FeO NPs. Carbonization-activation process was conducted under N2/CO2 atmosphere. Synthesized composites were used as sorbent and photocatalyst for tolue neremoval. The ban gap energy of photocatalyst (CB-TiO2-FeO) is reduced to 2.68 V. Toluene was removed by the photocatalyst (CB-TiO2-FeO) under visible light.

The activated carbon was better than SiO2 for higher alcohols synthesis. The reaction performances were affacted by the impregnation strategy. The Co/Co2C and Co-Fe alloy species are responsible for the alcohols synthesis.

In Cu2.0SiBEA mainly framework mononuclear Cu(II) was occurred. Both Cu2.0HAlBEA and Cu2.0SiBEA catalysts showed high activity in SCR NO with NH3. The state of copper as well as the acidity plays an important role in SCR of NO. Applied Catalysis A: General, 523 (2016) 332 Heterogenized hybrid catalyst of 1-sulfonic acid-3-methyl imidazolium ferric chloride over NaY zeolite for one-pot synthesis of 2-amino-4-arylpyrimidine derivatives: A viable approach Pinky Gogoi, Arup Kumar Dutta, Susmita Saikia, Ruli Borah Department of Chemical Sciences, Tezpur University, Napaam, 784028, Tezpur, Assam, India Six different ratios of NaY zeolite supported 1-sulfonic acid-3-methyl imidazolium ferric chloride[Msim] [FeCl4] are prepared as hybrid material for investigation. All these composites are characterized using PXRD, FT-IR, Raman, TGA, SEM, TEM, EDX, BET, ICP-OES and UV-Vis techniques. The gradual destruction of zeolite structure observed in FT-IR and PXRD studies via dealumination process with increasing percentage of [Msim] [FeCl4] salt.

The effect of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio on methanol to gasoline was systematically studied. Increasing SiO2/Al2O3 ratio reduced durene yield and improved catalyst durability. Low SiO2/Al2O3 ratios promoted C1-C4 and durene selectivity. Catalysts with low SiO2/Al2O3 ratios deactivated more rapidly due tocoking.
