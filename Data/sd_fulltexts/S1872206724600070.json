To overcome these issues, a bifunctional oxygen catalyst (KB@Co-C3N4) was developed by utilizing graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) to support Co-N x active sites and simultaneously to wrap Ketjen black (KB) to form a wonton structure. The resulting catalyst exhibited excellent ORR/OER activity and good stability in neutral electrolytes. The KB@Co-C3N4 catalyst demonstrated a half-wave potential (E 1/2) of 0.723 V and only a 9 mV decay after 40000 cycles of ORR accelerated durability test (ADT). In terms of OER, the overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 (η 10) of KB@Co-C3N4 was 550 mV, with negligible increase observed even after 20 k cycles of OER ADT. The zinc-air battery incorporating KB@Co-C3N4 exhibited superior performances over other benchmark bifunctional counterparts in open-circuit voltage (1.52 V), galvanostatic discharge/charge performance and cycling duration (985 h at 5 mA cm−2). The theoretical investigation revealed that the engineered electronic structures of the metal active sites enable precise regulation of the charge distribution of Co centers, leading to optimized adsorption and desorption of oxygenated intermediates. The high stability of the catalyst is attributed to the chemically stable C3N4, which strengthens Co-N x active sites and protects KB against carbon corrosion by wrapping KB to form the wonton structure. Graphical Abstract M-N-C catalysts excel in oxygen catalysis in neutral electrolyte but face severe carbon corrosion at high potential. Wrapping KB substrate with Co-C3N4 mitigates this issue, granting the catalyst (KB@Co-C3N4) superior activity and stability. Keywords Oxygen electrocatalysis Single-atomic catalysts Neutral electrolyte Corrosion resistance 1 Introduction Zinc-air batteries (ZABs) have garnered significant attention as prospective energy storage solutions ever since their inception in the late 19th century [1–3]. In comparison to alkaline ZABs, neutral ZABs are more environment-friendly and milder with longer battery life [4–7]. However, the research of neutral ZABs is still in its infancy largely because of the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reactions including oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which contribute the biggest to the voltage loss of the battery [8,9]. Therefore, bifunctional oxygen catalysts with high activity and stability are significant for the development of neutral ZABs. Among many non-precious metal catalysts, metal and nitrogen co-doped carbons (M-N-Cs) are considered as the potential alternatives for noble-metal catalysts because of their maximum atom utilization, high activity and good selectivity [10–12]. Amorphous carbon materials (carbon black, activated carbon, etc.) are often used to support M-N-C sites because they can provide good electrical conductivity, high surface area and a great number of defects acting as anchoring sites [13]. However, carbon materials are easily corroded by the high potential of ORR due to the low thermodynamic oxidation potential of carbon, as shown in the following reaction [14,15]: C + 2H2O → CO2 + 4H+ + 4e− E 0 = 0.207 V When discharging, the potential at the positive electrode of ZABs is always about 0.5 V higher than the thermodynamic potential of carbon oxidation, which will cause severe carbon corrosion in the cathode. For M-N-C, the corrosion will lead to deterioration of catalytic activity, due to the destruction of M-N x active site, loss of active specific surface area, reduced electrical connectivity and changes in pore morphology and surface characteristics [15–17]. The situation is much worse when it comes to battery charging (i.e. the OER process). Therefore, it is key to develop M-N-C catalysts possessing high bifunctional catalytic activities and at the same time good resistance to electrochemical corrosion. Many methods have been proposed to improve the stability of M-N-C catalysts. For example, highly graphitized carbon was used as the substrate with high corrosion resistance and electrical conductivity, but it decreased the density of active sites due to fewer defects acting as anchoring sites [13,18]. As carbon oxidation is more likely to occur at the defect-rich edge, controlling the edge of the carbon matrix can effectively slow down carbon corrosion [19,20]. Nonetheless, the edge control will also deteriorate the active site density of M-N-C by decreasing anchoring sites [19,21,22]. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop the support of M-N-Cs with high corrosion resistance and plenty of anchoring sites. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has the advantages of stable chemical structure, high corrosion resistance and unique electron and energy band structure, so it has become one of the hot research materials in the field of catalysis [23–25]. The high content of pyridinic N in g-C3N4 provides abundant lone electron pairs to anchor metal atom. Thus, unlike low concentrations of nitrogen species in normal M-N-C, g-C3N4 can provide abundant nitrogen ligands [26]. Therefore, by utilizing the abundant nitrogen ligand and stable chemical structure of g-C3N4, M-N-Cs with g-C3N4 as the support is expected to provide more metal active sites and to have higher chemical stability. Herein, a highly active and stable oxygen catalyst was prepared by using exfoliated g-C3N4 nanosheets to support Co-N x and also to wrap Ketjen black (KB@Co-C3N4). The g-C3N4 material shows a ‘one stone, two birds’ effect by not only providing rich nitrogen ligands for Co-N x but also strengthening the Co-N x active site and protecting KB against carbon oxidation. The choice of Co-N x as the catalyst is preferred due to its good ORR and OER catalytic activity [23,27,28], as well as the absence of side reactions like the Fenton reaction, which can trouble Fe-N-C [29]. It is noteworthy that in previous studies, Co-doped C3N4 supported on different carbon substrates such as ordered mesoporous carbon [30], mesoporous carbon [31], and carbon nanotubes [23] have been reported. All these studies involved the calcination of small molecules to produce carbon-supported Co-doped C3N4. However, during the formation of C3N4, the small molecules tend to agglomerate spontaneously [26], leading to the inability of Co-C3N4 to be uniformly wrapped on the carbon substrates. Consequently, the catalysts prepared in these studies exhibited limited activity and stability in oxygen catalysis. The wonton structure KB@Co-C3N4 formed by the use of exfoliated g-C3N4 in this work shows excellent activity and stability. For ORR, the half-wave potential (E 1/2) of KB@Co-C3N4 is 0.723 V, outperforming that of commercial Pt/C (0.673 V). Moreover, the E 1/2 of KB@Co-C3N4 only decreases 9 mV after 40000 cycles of ORR accelerated durability test (ADT), while Pt/C experiences a 41 mV decrease after only 7500 cycles of ORR ADT. In terms of OER, the overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 (η 10) of KB@Co-C3N4 is 550 mV and remains unchanged after 20000 cycles of OER ADT, whereas it is 560 mV for commercial RuO2 and increases by 37 mV after 4000 cycles of OER ADT. The KB@Co-C3N4-based ZAB demonstrates outstanding performance, with a high open-circuit voltage (OCP) of 1.52 V, a maximum peak power density of 70.54 mW cm−2, and good charge/discharge durability. 2 Experimental 2.1 Reagents and materials Cobalt chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2·6H2O, AR), melamine (C3H6N6, 99%), ammonium chloride (NH4Cl, 99.5%), potassium chloride (KCl, 99%), zinc chloride (ZnCl2, 99%), ethanol (C2H5OH) and dicyandiamide (DCD, 99%) are bought from Macklin, hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37%) and nitric acid (HNO3, 67%) from Xilong, Ketjen black (KB, EC600JD) from Japan LION. Pure water obtained through filtration using a Millipore Milli-Q Integral Water Purification System (Millipore Corp.) was utilized as the standard solvent. 2.2 Synthesis C3N4 and oxidized Ketjen black (OKB) were first prepared. For OKB, 1 g of KB was dispersed in 60 mL of 6 mol L−1 HNO3, and refluxed at 120 °C under vigorous magnetic stirring for about 6 h. The resulting dispersion was centrifuged and then washed with deionized water (DI) before being dried at 70 °C overnight. C3N4 was obtained by taking 1 g of ground melamine and calcining it at 550 °C in N2 for 4 h. To synthesize KB@C3N4, 100 mg of C3N4 was dispersed in a solution of 55 mL of EtOH, 20 mL of DI, and 15 mL of 1 mol L−1 HCl. After supersonic for 4 h at 80 °C, 100 mg of OKB was added to the solution and sonicated for another hour. The resultant was then evaporated at 120 °C overnight, and calcined at 550 °C in N2 for 4 h to obtain KB@C3N4. For KB@Co-C3N4, 100 mg of KB@C3N4, 50 mg of DCD, and 64.68 mg of CoCl2·6H2O were dispersed in 100 mL of DI and sonicated for 30 min. The solution was then evaporated at 80 °C overnight to remove the solvent before being ground and calcined at 600 °C in N2 for 4 h. KB@Co-C3N4 was collected by centrifugation, washing 3 times with 1 mol L−1 HCl, and finally drying at 80 °C overnight. The synthesis process of Co-C3N4 was as same as the process of KB@Co-C3N4, but KB@C3N4 was replaced by exfoliated C3N4. Before testing, equal mass Co-C3N4 and KB were grinded for 30 min, the KB+Co-C3N4 was prepared. As a comparison, a Co-N-C catalyst without C3N4 was synthesized. In a typical Co-N-C preparation, 100 mg of OKB, 44.41 mg of CoCl2·6H2O, and 50 mg of melamine were dispersed in a solution of 20 mL of EtOH and 10 mL of DI and sonicated for 30 min. The resulting solution was then evaporated at 130 °C, ground, and calcined at 800 °C for 2 h in N2. The resultant was washed with 1 mol L−1 HCl at least 3 times to remove Co clusters or particles and then dried at 80 °C overnight to obtain Co-N-C. A calcination temperature of 800 °C was chosen to avoid the formation of C3N4 in Co-N-C. 2.3 Characterizations The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum was acquired using the Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer, employing Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm) at 40 kV and 30 mA. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were conducted using the AXIS Ultra DLD instrument from Kratos Corporation, equipped with a monochromatic Al X-ray source. The metal content was quantified via inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) using the PerkinElmer Optima 8300 instrument. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer spectrometer with a pre-calibrated deuterium lamp for UV, an iodine tungsten lamp, and a dual-beam spectrometer for the visible-near infrared range. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) data was collected using the Spotlight200i system from PerkinElmer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF- STEM) images of the as-synthesized samples were acquired utilizing a JEM-2100F microscope with an accelerating voltage of 300 kV. Sub-angstrom resolution HAADF-STEM images were obtained employing a spherical-aberration-corrected STEM (FEI Themis Z) and monochromator at an accelerated voltage of 300 kV. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), encompassing X-ray absorption near edge structures (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structures (EXAFS), was conducted on the Co K-edge samples at the XAFCA beamline situated within the Singapore Synchrotron Light Source (SSLS) facility, operating at injection currents of 2.5 GeV below 200 mA. A Si (1 1 1) double-crystal monochromator was employed to mitigate the harmonic content of the monochromatic beam during the measurements. The Co K-edge XANES data were acquired in a transmission mode, with Co foil, CoO, and Co2O3 serving as reference materials. The extraction and processing of the EXAFS data were performed using the ATHENA module within the FEFIT software package, following standard procedures. 2.4 Electrochemical measurements The electrochemical evaluations of the catalysts were conducted using either a CHI760E electrochemical station from CH Instruments, Inc., Shanghai, or an Autolab PGSTAT M204 system with a conventional three-electrode setup in 0.5 mol L−1 NH4Cl (pH adjusted to 7 ± 0.05 with ammonia), 0.5 mol L−1 H2SO4, or 0.1 mol L−1 KOH electrolyte. The working electrodes were prepared by drop-casting catalyst inks onto a glassy carbon (GC) disk of a rotating disk electrode (RDE, 5 mm in diameter, 0.19625 cm2) or a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE, 5.61 mm diameter, 0.2475 cm2) with a Pt ring (6.25 mm inner diameter and 7.92 mm outer diameter). In the comparative analysis, commercially available Pt/C (20 wt% on carbon black, Johnson Matthey) and RuO2 (> 75%, Suzhou Sinero Technology) were utilized as benchmark catalysts. The catalyst ink for Pt/C, Co-C3N4, and KB@Co-C3N4 was prepared by mixing 5 mg of catalyst, 100 µL of a 5 wt% Nafion solution, and 400 µL of ethanol in a plastic vial under ultrasonication for a minimum of 30 minutes. Subsequently, 5 µL of the catalyst ink was drop-cast onto the GC surface, resulting in an approximate catalyst loading of 0.25 mg cm−2. For the RuO2 ink preparation, 5 mg of RuO2 and 1 mg of Ketjen black were dispersed in a mixture of 1 mL ethanol and 1 mg of 5% Nafion under ultrasonication for at least 30 minutes. Following this, 10 µL of the RuO2 catalyst ink was drop-cast onto the GC surface, achieving an approximate catalyst loading of 0.25 mg cm−2. The standard three-electrode half-cell configuration comprised an Ag/AgCl reference electrode (in 3.5 mol L−1 KCl, aqueous solution), a graphite rod counter electrode, and a GC working electrode. The O2-saturated environment was established by continuously passing O2 through the electrolyte for a minimum of 30 minutes, which was maintained throughout the electrochemical measurements. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was conducted with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 (1600 r min−1) in O2-saturated 0.1 mol L−1 KOH (ORR potential range: 0.1 to –0.7 V; OER potential range: 0 to 0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl), 0.5 mol L−1 H2SO4 (ORR potential range: 0.8 to 0.0 V; OER potential range: 0.9 to 1.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl), or 0.5 mol L−1 NH4Cl solution (ORR potential range: 0.3 to –0.5 V; OER potential range: 0.6 to 1.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl). The accelerated durability test (ADT) was carried out using the cyclic voltammetry technique with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 in O2-saturated 0.1 mol L−1 KOH (ORR potential range: E 1/2 ± 0.15 V; OER potential range: 0 to 0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl), 0.5 mol L−1 H2SO4 (ORR potential range: E 1/2 ± 0.15V; OER potential range: 0.9 to 1.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl), or 0.5 mol L−1 NH4Cl solution (ORR potential range: E 1/2 ± 0.15 V; OER potential range: 0.6 to 1.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl). All ORR/OER LSV curves were iR-compensated, and all potentials in the study were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the appropriate formula. E(vs. RHE) = E(vs. Ag/AgCl) + 0.0592pH + 0.205 The calculation of H2O2 yield over various catalysts relies on the Ring-Disk Electrode (RRDE) ring and disk currents. The percentage of HO2 − generated by the ORR and the number of transferred electrons (n) can be estimated using the following formula: H O 2 - % = 200 * I r N I d + I r N n = 4 * I d I d + I r N In the given experimental setup involving the RRDE, the variables I d representing the disk current density, I r denoting the ring current density, and N signifying the current collection efficiency specific to the Pt ring disk, where N is precisely defined as 0.37. In order to figure out the OER selectivity, we measured the content of Cl2 to calculate the current contributions from OER and CER. The Cl2 content was measured by an indirect method, where it equals to I2 content after Cl2 oxidizes I− to form I2: Cl2 + 2I− → I2 + 2Cl− First, the constant current test was carried out at the current density of 5, 8 and 10 mA cm−2, and the quantity of electric charge was controlled to be 30 C cm−2. Excess KI was then added to the electrolyte so that it reacted fully with the Cl2. Then ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy was used to detect the I2 content in the electrolyte, which is the same as that of Cl2. The proportion of CER can be calculated by the following equation [32]: η CER (%) = [Cl]2 V/{Q × S/(n × F)} ×100%η OER(%) = 100%–CER In the experimental context, V symbolizes the volume of the electrolyte (40 mL), Q represents the quantity of electric charge during electrolysis (30 C cm−2), S denotes the geometric surface area of the GC electrode, n signifies the number of electrons transferred (which is 2 for CER), and F corresponds to the faradaic constant (96485 C mol−1). 2.5 Theoretical investigation In this study, the bond energy and Gibbs free energy of KB@Co-C3N4 and Co-N-C catalysts were computed using density functional theory (DFT). The calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) with plane wave basis sets and the projection augmented wave method. The generalized gradient approximation PBE (GGA-PBE) was utilized for the exchange-correlation potential. Prior to the electronic structure calculations, the lattice constants and atomic structures of the systems were optimized. The optimization of the structures employed the Gaussian expansion method with convergence criteria for forces and energy cutoff set at 0.01 eV Å−1 and 500 eV, respectively. The Brillouin zone was sampled using a Monkhorst-Pack 3 × 3 × 1 k-point grid. For the Gibbs free energy calculations, a supercell with a 2 × 2 unit cell and a 20 Å spacing between two layers in the z direction was constructed. The calculation of Co–N bond energy of KB@Co-C3N4 and Co-N-C was based on the following equation: E b = (E co-C3N4 – E g-C3N4 – E M) And the above symbols represent the energy of the Co–N bond, KB@Co-C3N4, g-C3N4 and the Co atoms, respectively. 2.6 Battery tests In terms of the preparation of catalysts ink for ZABs, 15 mg KB@Co-C3N4 or 7.5 mg Pt/C+7.5 mg RuO2 was mixed with 3.75 mg PVDF, and then the mixture was dispersed in 1600 μL NMP with vigorous stirring overnight. The loading mass of catalyst is 1 mg cm−2 for both KB@Co-C3N4 and Pt/C+RuO2. The liquid ZABs were made by a polished Zn foil as anode, the catalysts supported on carbon paper as air cathode and 4 mol L−1 NH4Cl + 2 mol L−1 KCl (the pH was adjusted to 7±0.05 with ammonia) as neutral electrolyte. The diameter of air cathode was 1.1 cm, while the reaction area was about 0.95 cm2. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis and characterizations Fig. 1(a) illustrates the synthesis process of the wonton-structured KB@Co-C3N4 by two-step calcination. First, in the mixed solution of HCl, DI and EtOH, the bulk C3N4 was exfoliated to C3N4 nanosheets, and C3N4 nanosheets adsorbed on the following added OKB to form ‘wonton structure’, where OKB acted as fillers and C3N4 nanosheets played as wrappers. The exfoliated C3N4 has a size in the micron range and an average thickness of 1.5 nm, which can completely wrap KB with the particle size of ~30 nm (Figs. S1(a) and (b)). In the process of first calcination, OKB was reduced and bonded with the wrapping C3N4 nanosheets (KB@C3N4, Figs. S1(c)–(e)). In the second calcination, Co elements were coordinated by the abundant nitrogen ligands of C3N4 and the stacked thick C3N4 partially decomposed to form thinner C3N4 layer. After the synthesis, we first conducted XRD test on all the catalysts (Fig. S2(a)). For C3N4, the strong peak at 27.3° is assigned to (002) planes of g-C3N4 crystal which is typically the inter-planar stacking of the aromatic system [33] and the broad peak at 13.1° is assigned to plane (100) which is attributed to triazine repeat units [34,35]. However, the characteristic peaks of g-C3N4 could be hardly observed on KB@Co-C3N4. Because the signal is weak for C3N4 nanosheets with a short-range ordered structure [34] and the strongest peak at 27.3° overlaps with that of KB. In order to further verify the presence of C3N4 in the KB@Co-C3N4, the samples were tested by FTIR (Fig. S2(b)). The characteristic absorption peaks at the range of 1000–1600 cm−1 are attributed to the stretching vibration of aromatic C–N heterocycle in g-C3N4, which indicates the presence of C3N4 network in KB@Co-C3N4 [36,37]. TEM (Figs. 1(b)–(d)) images reveal that g-C3N4 has fully wrapped on the surface of KB. As shown in Fig. 1(d) , the thickness of the wrapping g-C3N4 is about 4 nm. Furthermore, the energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping measurements of KB@Co-C3N4 demonstrate that C, N, and Co atoms are uniformly distributed (Fig. 1(e)). Since N and Co elements mainly come from Co-C3N4, their uniform distributions suggest that Co-C3N4 sheets wrap KB particles very well. The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm shows that the BET surface area of KB, KB@C3N4 and KB@Co-C3N4 are 1331.64, 562.43 and 683.00 m2 g−1, respectively (Fig. S3). The decrease in surface area after first calcination was due to both the lower surface area of C3N4 and its blockage on the pore structure of KB, but second calcination thinned the C3N4 nanosheets and thus increased the BET surface area. Additionally, the identification of isolated single Co sites was directly confirmed through HAADF-STEM analysis. This confirmation was visually represented in Fig. 1(f), where random individual bright dots, highlighted by yellow encircled marks, indicated the presence of isolated single Co sites. The high density of single Co atoms in KB@Co-C3N4 proves the effective coordination by the large amount of pyridinic N in C3N4, which should be favorable for the oxygen catalysis. The surface chemistry information of catalysts can be analysed by XPS. For KB@Co-C3N4, the high-resolution Co 2p spectrum shows two peaks located at 781.0 and 796.3 eV, indexed to Co 2p 3/2 and Co 2p 1/2 of Co2+, respectively (Fig. 2(a) ) [38,39]. The N 1s spectrum in Fig. 2(b) displays four characteristic peaks: pyridinic N (398.6 eV), pyrrolic N (400.3 eV), graphitic N (402.0 eV) and oxidized N (405.6 eV) [29,40]. The C 1s spectrum of KB@Co-C3N4 can be fitted into four peaks at the binding energies of 284.8, 285.6, 288.6, and 291.0 eV, corresponding to graphitic C=C, C–C, C–N, and O–C=O, respectively [41]. The peak positions of Co, N and C elements of Co-N-C and KB@Co-C3N4 are similar but with the different content ratios of N types (Fig. S4), The pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, graphitic N and oxidized N content ratios of KB@Co-C3N4 are 54%, 22%, 14% and 10%; while 21%, 31%, 37% and 11% for Co-N-C, suggesting the high pyridinic N content in KB@Co-C3N4 benefiting from the rich pyridinic N of g-C3N4 (Table S1). Compared with other kinds of N, pyridinic N is more favourable to coordinate with Co atoms to form Co-N x moieties [38,42,43], and therefore KB@Co-C3N4 should have a high Co atom loading. Furthermore, N atoms could also serve as the active sites and the presence of C3N4 in KB@Co-C3N4 results in a high N atomic content of 6.54%, surpassing that of Co-N-C (2.23%), thereby contributing to the high activity of KB@Co-C3N4. ICP test shows that the Co atomic mass of KB@Co-C3N4 is 3.3%, while that of Co-N-C is 2.6% (Table S2). Both XPS and ICP tests advocate the high density of isolated Co atoms on C3N4, supporting the result that the catalytic performance of KB@Co-C3N4 is better than that of Co-N-C in the following test. Additionally, XAFS measurements can confirm the local structure of KB@Co-C3N4 catalyst at the atomic level [44]. The observed peak at 1.45 Å of KB@Co-C3N4 from k 2-weighted FT-EXAFS curve indicates the existence of Co–N coordination instead of Co–O coordination (1.61 Å) [45], and no obvious Co–Co scattering path at about 2.2 Å, revealing the existence of single Co sites in KB@Co-C3N4 and almost no Co particles or clusters (Fig. 2(d)). Fig. 2(e) shows the Co K-edge XANES spectroscopy. Due to the crossover of K-edge, we choose the highest absorption peak energy in the 1st derivative (E 0) of XANES as the basis for judging the valence state of Co. The E 0 of KB@Co-C3N4 is 7719.45 eV, while it is 7720.96 eV for CoO, indicating that the valence state of Co for KB@Co-C3N4 is close to Co2+, which is consistent with the XPS results. As shown in Fig. 2(f) and Table S3, the fitting results of KB@Co-C3N4 clearly demonstrate that the first shell coordination number is 3.9 ± 0.2. It is very likely that Co-N4 moiety is the dominant active center in KB@Co-C3N4. The atomic dispersion and coordination states of Co are determined by the resolution analysis of wavelet transform (WT)-EXAFS spectrum in radial space. The WT-EXAFS spectrum of KB@Co-C3N4 shows a maximum centered at 3.8 Å−1, which is ascribed to Co–N [38]. In contrast, the WT contour plot of Co foil shows a maximum centered at 7.0 Å−1 corresponding to Co–Co bonding [46]. In addition, CoO and Co2O3 both appear two maximum centers, corresponding to Co–O and Co–O–Co respectively, which are consistent with XANES. 3.2 Bifunctional oxygen catalysis The ORR/OER performances of KB@Co-C3N4 changed with different C3N4 amount, and the performances reached the best when n = 1 (n is the mass ratio of C3N4 over KB) (Figs. S5(a) and (b)). Acid washing can further improve the OER activity of KB@Co-C3N4 by removing the Co nanoparticles to expose more single Co atoms (Figs. S5(c) and (d)). As depicted in Fig. 3(a) , the ORR LSV tests reveal that KB@Co-C3N4 displays an exceptional half-wave potential (E 1/2) of 0.723 V in 0.5 mol L−1 NH4Cl electrolyte, higher than the commercial Pt/C (E 1/2 = 0.673 V), Co-N-C (E 1/2 = 0.694 V). Additionally, KB@Co-C3N4 shows much better bifunctional catalytic activity than the physical mixture of KB and Co-C3N4 (Figs. S5(e) and (f)). Theoretical calculations have demonstrated that metal doped-C3N4 can be a superior catalyst for ORR/OER [47–49]. However, in practice, metal doped-C3N4 shows limited activity due to the low electron conductivity of C3N4 [30,50]. The wonton-structure in this work can effectively address this issue over the simple physical mixture and show the apparent synergistic effect by the fully intimate wrapping of KB with Co-C3N4. δE 1/2 is defined as the difference of E 1/2 between the catalyst and the noble benchmark. KB@Co-C3N4 has δE 1/2 to be 50 mV, which outperforms the reported catalysts, and also good E 1/2 among the best (Fig. 4(g) , Fig. S6 and Table S4). The diffusion limited current density (J L) of KB@Co-C3N4 is 4.5 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3(a)), superior to the commercial Pt/C (3.9 mA cm−2). Moreover, the superior ORR kinetics of KB@Co-C3N4 is validated by a lower Tafel slope of 70.9 mV dec−1, in contrast to 80.4 mV dec−1 for commercial Pt/C and 77.6 mV dec−1 for Co-N-C (Fig. S7(a)). To determine the selectivity of catalyst during ORR, RRDE measurement was utilized to reveal H2O2 yield and electron transfer number. The H2O2 yield of KB@Co-C3N4 maintains the lowest percentage among the catalysts, demonstrating the high electron transfer number of 3.96–4.00 (Fig. S7(d)). Moreover, a small charge transfer resistance of the KB@Co-C3N4 catalyst also contributes to the superior ORR activity (Fig. S7(g)). Stability is another crucial indicator for accessing catalytic performance. As depicted in Fig. 3(b), compared to the sharp decrease by 41 mV for Pt/C and by 44 mV for Co-N-C after just 7500 cycles of ADT cycles, only 9 mV decay of E 1/2 for KB@Co-C3N4 catalyst is detected after 40k cycles of ADT cycles in 0.5 mol L−1 NH4Cl, which outperforms those of noble metals and most other reported catalysts (Table S5). Moreover, the TEM images of the KB@Co-C3N4 catalyst indicate no obvious changes in morphology and microstructure after 40 k cycles of ADT cycles (Figs. S8(a) and (b)). In addition, it can be seen from EDS mapping that Co is evenly distributed without the obvious presence of particles or clusters, advocating that C3N4 can effectively strengthen the Co-N x active site and protect KB against carbon oxidation by good wrapping in KB@Co-C3N4 with the wonton structure (Fig. S8(c)). OER activity is another significant evaluation for bifunctional oxygen catalyst. KB@Co-C3N4 demonstrates the lowest overpotential (η 10) of 550 mV at 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3(c)) with Tafel slope of 70.4 mV dec−1 (Fig. S9(a)), outperforming those of RuO2 (560 mV, 131.9 mV dec−1) and Co-N-C (600 mV, 97.1 mV dec−1). Additionally, KB@Co-C3N4 shows a much smaller charge transfer resistance (Fig. S9(d)). Similar to the good stability for ORR, KB@Co-C3N4 also shows excellent OER stability even in a harsher environment. As shown in Fig. 3(d), compared to the sharp increase by 37 mV for RuO2 and by 20 mV for Co-N-C after just 4 k cycles of OER ADT cycles, no obvious increase of η 10 for KB@Co-C3N4 is detected after 20 k cycles of ADT cycles in 0.5 mol L−1 NH4Cl. After OER ADT test, the TEM images show almost no changes of KB@Co-C3N4 in morphology (Figs. S8(d) and (e)) and the EDS mapping shows uniform distribution of Co element (Fig. S8(f)), which demonstrates the good strengthening effects on the Co-N x active site and effective protection on KB by C3N4 even at the high potential of OER region. The mesopores and micropores of KB@Co-C3N4 and Co-N-C will be blocked by the generated O2 during the long time OER ADT process, resulting in a smaller effective contact area between the catalyst and the electrolyte, which will deteriorate the OER performance of the catalyst. The OER activity can be corrected by ORR activation to fully recover the catalyst-electrolyte contact after OER ADT (Figs. S10(a) and (c)). ORR activation has little effect on the performance of RuO2 because of its small surface area and lack of pore structure (Fig. S10(b)). Excellent bifunctional catalysts can function well for alternate ORR and OER in battery applications, so we also test the ORR performance of catalysts after OER ADT. As shown in Fig. 3(e), E 1/2 decays only 52 mV for KB@Co-C3N4 after 20000 cycles of OER ADT, but 132 mV for Co-N-C after 4000 cycles of OER ADT. This again demonstrates the good strengthening on the Co-N x active site and the high protection effects on KB by C3N4. ΔE is defined as the potential difference between the OER potential at 10 mA cm−2 and E 1/2 of ORR (ΔE = E 10 − E 1/2) and is an important indicator to evaluate the bifunctional performance of a catalyst. A smaller ΔE means a better bifunctional performance. The ΔE of KB@Co-C3N4 is 1.05 V, which outperforms those of noble metals and most other reported catalysts in neutral media (Figs. 3(f) and (h), Table S4). In alkaline electrolyte, the E 1/2 of KB@Co-C3N4 is 0.899 V, outperforming those of Pt/C (0.874 V), Co-N-C (0.823 V) and other reported catalysts (Figs. S11(a), S12, S13 and Table S4). In addition, KB@Co-C3N4 has a low Tafel slope (62.8 mV dec−1, Fig. S7(b)), a small charge-transfer resistance (Fig. S7(h)), a low H2O2 yield and a high electron-transfer number (Fig. S7(e)), which all contribute to good ORR performance. For the stability, the ORR ADT result indicates the excellent ORR stability of KB@Co-C3N4 compared with Pt/C and other reported catalysts (Fig. S11(b) and Table S5). After ORR ADT, KB@Co-C3N4 shows no obvious changes in morphology (Figs. S14(a) and (b)) and no Co particles or clusters are formed (Fig. S14(c)). Although, in terms of OER activity, KB@Co-C3N4 is not as good as RuO2 in 1 mol L−1 KOH (Fig. S15(a) and S9(b) and (e)), the ΔE of KB@Co-C3N4 is still smaller than most reported catalyst (Fig. S16). It's satisfactory that KB@Co-C3N4 shows excellent OER stability. After 20000 cycles of OER ADT, the η 10 of RuO2 increases 156 mV while KB@Co-C3N4 increases only 30 mV (Fig. S15(b)). The E 1/2 of KB@Co-C3N4 decreases 96 mV after 20000 cycles of OER ADT (Fig. S11c). After OER ADT, the OER performance degradation of Co-N-C is more significant than that of ORR, because although the Co-N x site was destroyed at high potential, the remaining N-C (graphitic N, pyridinic N) can still serve as the catalytic site for ORR [41]. The TEM of KB@Co-C3N4 after OER ADT also shows almost no morphology change and an even distribution of Co atom, indicating the chemically-stable wonton structure of KB@Co-C3N4 in KOH (Figs. S14(d)−(f)). The activities of both ORR and OER deteriorate to some extent after OER ADT in KOH at high potential range, because in alkaline media OH radicals will attack the microcrystalline graphite structure of KB at high potential, and makes the graphite layer dissolve in the electrolyte [15,51], which will cause the performance deterioration. In 0.5 mol L−1 H2SO4, both ORR and OER activities are not as satisfactory as those in neutral and alkaline electrolytes (Fig. S11(d), Fig. S15(c), Figs. S7(c), (f), (i), Figs. S9(c) and (f)). Although the ORR/OER stabilities of KB@Co-C3N4 are better than those of noble-metal catalysts and Co-N-C in acid, it is still far worse than those in neutral and alkaline electrolytes (Figs. S11(e), (f) and Fig. S15(d)). The morphology of KB@Co-C3N4 shows no obvious change after ORR/OER ADT in 0.5 mol L−1 H2SO4, (Figs. S17(a)–(e)). It's worth paying attention to the EDS mapping (Fig. S17(f)), where the weak signals of Co elements demonstrate the destruction of Co-N x sites after OER ADT. This is because C3N4 will be exfoliated by protons in an acidic environment, similar to the intercalation and exfoliation of graphene with sulfuric acid [26,52,53]. The exfoliation of C3N4 leads to the destruction of active sites, resulting in the poor activity and stability. Due to the narrow potential difference of 0.13 V between the standard potentials for chlorine evolution reaction (CER) and OER [54], the utilization of chloride-based electrolytes significantly enhances the propensity for chlorine gas (Cl2) generation during OER catalysis, as evidenced by the following reactions: 2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e− E 0 = 1.23 V 2Cl− → Cl2 + 2e− E 0 = 1.36 V Therefore, the current density of OER in the chloride-based electrolyte may have CER contribution. As shown in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), KB@Co-C3N4 has a larger overpotential at the same current density compared with RuO2. This is due to the pore blockage of KB@Co-C3N4 by O2, which is consistent with the previous discussion. The standard absorbance curve of I2 at 440 nm was firstly plotted as the function of the I2 mass in 40 mL 0.5 mol L−1 NH4Cl (Figs. S18(a) and (b)). Figs. 4(c) and (d) demonstrates that at different current density from 5 to 10 mA cm−2, the absorption of the electrolyte after OER operation of KB@Co-C3N4 is much smaller than that of RuO2. According to the absorption, we can calculate that KB@Co-C3N4 has an average OER current proportion of 98.4%, which is much higher than that of RuO2 (83.9%). The above results show that KB@Co-C3N4 has both good OER activity and high OER selectivity thanks to Co-N x active site. 3.3 Mechanism investigations DFT calculations were used to further explore the origin of the high activity and good stability of KB@Co-C3N4. The active site model and the adsorption of oxygen-containing intermediates on KB@Co-C3N4 (left) and Co-N-C (right) are shown in Fig. 5(a) . The Co–N bond energy of KB@Co-C3N4 is 7.82 eV, higher than that of Co-N-C (3.15 eV). In general, higher bond energies typically indicate stronger bond formations, which can enhance the thermal and chemical stability of the catalysts. This is particularly important in the design of oxygen catalysts, as they are often used under extreme conditions. The results consistent with the above electrochemical test results that KB@Co-C3N4 possesses excellent stability. Interestingly, the length of Co–N and C–N are 2.363 and 1.792 in both KB@Co-C3N4 and Co-N-C, respectively. The modification of KB@Co-C3N4 may lead to a redistribution of electron density near the Co–N bond, enhancing electron sharing and potentially increasing bond energy without necessarily altering bond length. In DFT calculations, the increase in bond energy typically indicates greater electron participation in bonding, but this does not always result in significant geometric changes. As shown in Fig. 5(b), both KB@Co-C3N4 and Co-N-C follow the same ORR/OER reaction path. The negative free energies of KB@Co-C3N4 and Co-N-C at equilibrium potential (U = 1.23 V vs. RHE) show the thermodynamically spontaneous ORR process. The step with the highest Gibbs free energy is considered to be the rate-determining step (RDS) for the whole ORR process. For KB@Co-C3N4, the RDS is O2 → OOH* (ΔG = 0.73 eV). However, for Co-N-C, there is a bigger energy barrier as the RDS: OH* → H2O (ΔG = 1.65 eV). KB@Co-C3N4 thus demonstrates a faster ORR kinetics than Co-N-C. Fig. 5(b) also presents an in-depth understanding of the OER performance on the two catalysts. At U = 1.23 V, the RDS of KB@Co-C3N4 is O* → OOH* with an energy barrier value of 0.37 eV. In the case of Co-N-C, the RDS is OOH* → O2 with an energy barrier as high as 1.92 eV. KB@Co-C3N4 also possesses a higher activity than Co-N-C in terms of OER. The results of DFT calculations confirm that g-C3N4 is an effective support that enhances the stability of the Co-N x active site, regulates the charge distribution of Co center, and optimizes the adsorption/desorption of oxygenated intermediates, resulting in a significant reduction of energy barriers for ORR/OER. These effects contribute to the excellent stability and high ORR/OER activity of KB@Co-C3N4. 3.4 Battery tests in Zinc-air battery with neutral electrolyte To further validate the application potential of bifunctional KB@Co-C3N4 in energy conversion devices, a rechargeable ZAB was assembled with KB@Co-C3N4 as the air cathode, polished zinc plate as anode and 4 mol L−1 NH4Cl + 2 mol L−1 KCl as the electrolyte (Fig. 6(a) ). The OCP are 1.52 and 1.34 V for KB@Co-C3N4 and Pt/C+RuO2 based ZABs, respectively (Fig. 6(b)). At the rate test where current density changes from 5 to 50 mA cm−2, the voltage of KB@Co-C3N4 ZAB are always higher than that of Pt/C+RuO2 ZAB. The stable discharge plateaus are observed in KB@Co-C3N4 ZAB, while Pt/C+RuO2 ZAB shows significant voltage losses after the high discharging current density of 50 mA cm−2, which indicates a good rate performance for KB@Co-C3N4 ZAB (Fig. 6(c)). Additionally, the charge transfer resistance of KB@Co-C3N4 ZAB is much smaller than that of Pt/C+RuO2 ZAB (Fig. 6(d)). In terms of the discharge polarization and power density curves, Fig. 6(e) shows that KB@Co-C3N4 ZAB has the peak power density of 70.54 mW cm−2, which is 2.4 times of that of Pt/C+RuO2 ZAB (28.39 mW cm−2). The cyclability of ZAB was evaluated under continuous galvanostatic discharge/charge at a current density of 5 mA cm−2 with the duration of 10 min per cycle. At the first cycle, Pt/C+RuO2 ZAB has a discharge voltage of 1.01 V, but quickly decays at the following cycles due to the poor stability of Pt/C (Fig. 6(f)). In comparison to Pt/C+RuO2 ZAB, KB@Co-C3N4 ZAB demonstrates a relatively low charge-discharge voltage gap of 0.88–1.13 V, maintaining an ultralong cycling of 985 hours among neutral ZABs. This underscores its exceptional long-term durability (Fig. 6(f)). Importantly, compared with other neutral electrolyte ZABs with carbon-based catalysts as cathode, our ZAB with KB@Co-C3N4 as cathode demonstrates the longest battery life, suggesting again the advantage of the wonton-structured design for improving the stability of carbon-based catalysts [55–62] (Fig. 6(g)). Consequently, the zinc-air battery incorporating KB@Co-C3N4 exhibits superior performances over other benchmark bifunctional counterparts in OCP and galvanostatic discharge/charge performance (Table S6). These battery test results strongly prove the superiority of KB@Co-C3N4 as a potential bifunctional oxygen catalyst in the neutral ZAB. 4 Conclusions In summary, we prepared a wonton-structured KB@Co-C3N4 with high activity and good stability, which can be attributed to the ‘one stone, two birds’ effect of C3N4: not only providing rich nitrogen ligands to form Co-N x active sites, but also employing the chemical stability to strengthen Co-N x active sites and to protect KB against corrosion. KB@Co-C3N4 demonstrated remarkable ORR/OER performance in neutral environments. The E 1/2 of KB@Co-C3N4 is 0.723 V and decays only 9 mV after 40000 cycles of ORR ADT, outperforming that of commercial Pt/C (0.673 V) and previous work. In terms of OER, the η 10 of KB@Co-C3N4 is 550 mV and negligible increase is observed even after 20000 cycles of OER ADT. ZAB using KB@Co-C3N4 shows the far better performance and stability than that employing precious catalyst (Pt/C+RuO2), indicating the great potential of KB@Co-C3N4 as a bifunctional oxygen catalyst. Therefore, this work not only designs a bifunctional oxygen catalyst with excellent performance to promote the development of neutral ZABs, but also provides a reference design method to improve the corrosion resistance of catalysts.

        "dc:description": "This work addresses the challenges faced by oxygen catalysis applications in neutral media, which are hindered by sluggish kinetics and severe carbon corrosion. To overcome these issues, a bifunctional oxygen catalyst (KB@Co-C3N4) was developed by utilizing graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) to support Co-N x active sites and simultaneously to wrap Ketjen black (KB) to form a wonton structure. The resulting catalyst exhibited excellent ORR/OER activity and good stability in neutral electrolytes. The KB@Co-C3N4 catalyst demonstrated a half-wave potential (E 1/2) of 0.723 V and only a 9 mV decay after 40000 cycles of ORR accelerated durability test (ADT). In terms of OER, the overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 (η 10) of KB@Co-C3N4 was 550 mV, with negligible increase observed even after 20 k cycles of OER ADT. The zinc-air battery incorporating KB@Co-C3N4 exhibited superior performances over other benchmark bifunctional counterparts in open-circuit voltage (1.52 V), galvanostatic discharge/charge performance and cycling duration (985 h at 5 mA cm−2). The theoretical investigation revealed that the engineered electronic structures of the metal active sites enable precise regulation of the charge distribution of Co centers, leading to optimized adsorption and desorption of oxygenated intermediates. The high stability of the catalyst is attributed to the chemically stable C3N4, which strengthens Co-N x active sites and protects KB against carbon corrosion by wrapping KB to form the wonton structure.",
