Graphical abstract The amino-functionalized bipyridine–heteropolyacid ionic hybrid is a highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst for solventless H2O2-based oxidations of alcohols, adding advantages of fast reaction rate, easy recovery, and quite steady reuse. Highlights ► A new ionic hybrid is prepared with amino functionalized bipyridine and heteropolyacid. ► The hybrid catalyst leads to the heterogeneous solventless oxidation of alcohols with H2O2. ► The hybrid catalyst gives high conversion and selectivity. ► The catalyst shows fast reaction rate, easy recovery, and steady reuse. A new amino-functionalized bipyridine–heteropolyacid ionic hybrid was prepared by protonating and anion-exchanging the amino-attached bipyridine ionic liquid with phosphotungstic acid, and characterized by FT-IR, 1H NMR, UV–vis, XRD, SEM, TG, BET surface area, melting point, and elemental analysis. Its catalytic activity was evaluated in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol with aqueous H2O2. The hybrid catalyst is proved to be a highly efficient solid catalyst for solvent-free oxidation of benzyl alcohol with H2O2, which is featured by the fast reaction rate, high conversion and selectivity, easy recovery, and quite steady reuse. Keywords Hybrid catalyst Heteropolyacid Oxidation of benzyl alcohol Ionic liquid Heterogeneous catalysis 1 Introduction Heteropolyacids (HPAs) are a class of well-defined transition metal oxygen clusters with structural diversity, showing many applications in catalysis, electronics, optics, medicine, biology, etc. [1]. Because of the rich redox chemistry, HPAs have been widely used as the catalysts for organic oxidations [2], among which tungsten-containing Keggin-structured HPA catalysts have been revealed to be very effective in the oxidation of alcohols with H2O2 [3,4]. However, HPA catalysts usually need the use of organic solvents, and cannot be recovered conveniently due to their good solubility in polar and oxidative media. Therefore, HPAs are immobilized onto various carriers, whereby the supported catalysts could be recovered by filtration or solvent precipitation [5,6]. Nevertheless, this approach always suffers from the slow reaction rate due to support effects, leaching of active species from the carrier surface, and/or a solvent dependence [7,8]. Also with HPA-based catalysts, versatile reaction systems have be reported; for example, the quaternary ammonium-modified HPA catalysts are able to result in heterogeneous [9], phase-transfer [10], and emulsion catalytic systems [11]. However, these procedures are complicated in separation of catalysts, and difficult in improving HPA's redox properties. Thus far, the seeking of highly efficient heterogeneous HPA-based catalysts for the solventless oxidation of alcohols with H2O2 remains a challenge. Notably, using ionic liquids (ILs) as reaction media, homogeneous or biphasic reaction systems of the oxidation of alcohols have been developed, and the IL-based catalytic phase could be recycled by solvent extraction or liquid separation [12]. Recently, the design and application of HPA-based IL hybrids have been proposed as a catalyst upgrade for organic syntheses [13], and some thermal/solvent-responsive HPA-based IL hybrids have been reported [14,15]. In this context, we have prepared a series of HPA-based ionic hybrid catalysts by pairing acid-functionalized IL cations with heteropolyanions which prove to be highly active, conveniently recoverable, and steadily reusable catalysts [16–19]. In order to get the nonsoluble and undegradable HPA-based catalysts for the H2O2-intermediated oxidation reactions, together with an improved redox activity, we have designed HPA-based amino-functionalized ionic solids for the liquid–solid heterogeneous epoxidation of alkenes with H2O2 [20]. However, these early obtained HPA-based IL hybrids fail to function as the heterogeneous catalysts for the solventless oxidation of alcohols with H2O2, due to their soluble properties in the strong polar and oxidative media. The amino groups tethered to IL cations have been demonstrated as the catalytic promoters for HPA active sites in selective oxidation reactions due to the electron transfer from amino groups to HPA frameworks [20]. Moreover, dicationic ILs are known to allow the greater variety and control of ILs’ virtual properties, including solubility and meltability, which are determinate factors to result in a heterogeneous catalysis. Accordingly, in this study, we design and synthesize a new HPA-based ionic hybrid catalyst by protonating and anion-exchanging the amino-functionalized 4,4-bipyridine IL precursor [DPyAM]Br2 with the most usually used phosphotungstic acid H3PW12O40 (PW). The obtained hybrid product DPyAM(H)-PW is characterized by UV–vis, FT-IR, SEM, XRD, TG, 1H NMR, BET surface area, melting point, and elemental analysis, and evaluated as the catalyst for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol with H2O2, the model reaction for the selective oxidation of alcohols. The hybrid catalyst leads to a liquid–solid heterogeneous catalytic system, and under a solvent-free condition, it exhibits high conversion and selectivity, easy recovery, and quite a steady reuse. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and methods All chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received. FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 360 FT-IR instrument (KBr discs). 1H NMR spectra were measured with a Bruker DPX 300 spectrometer at ambient temperature in D2O using TMS as internal reference. Elemental analyses (C, H, N) were performed on a CHN elemental analyzer (FlashEA 1112). Melting points were determined using an 4× digital microscopic melting point apparatus with an upper limit of 250°C. TG analysis was carried out with a STA409 instrument in dry air at a heating rate of 10°C/min. XRD patterns were collected on the Bruker D8 Advance powder diffractometer using Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation source at 40kV and 20mA, from 5° to 80° with a scan rate of 0.5°/min. BET surface areas were measured at the temperature of liquid nitrogen using a Micromeritics ASAP2010 analyzer. The samples were degassed at 150°C to a vacuum of 10−3 Torr before analysis. SEM images were performed on a HITACHI S-4800 field-emission scanning electron microscope. ESR spectra were recorded on a Bruker EMX-10/12 spectrometer at X-band. The measurements were done at −118°C in a frozen solution provided by a liquid/gas nitrogen temperature regulation system controlled by a thermocouple located at the bottom of the microwave cavity within a Dewar insert. 2.2 Catalyst preparation 2.2.1 N,N′-bis-2-aminoethyl-4,4′-bipyridinium dibromide ([DPyAM]Br2) The amino-attached 4,4-bipyridine precursor [DPyAM]Br2 was prepared according to the previous reports [21,22]. 4,4-Bipyridyl (0.02mol) and 2-bromoethylamine hydrobromide (0.04mol) were dissolved in acetonitrile (50mL) at 80°C for 12h with stirring. Then, the precipitate was filtered off, washed with acetonitrile, and dried to afford the [Dmim]Br2·2HBr as a yellow solid. Next, [DPyAM]Br2·2HBr was dissolved in 2mol/L aqueous solution of NaOH and left for 12h. Afterwards, colorless needle-shaped crystals precipitated, which were filtered off, washed with water and alcohol, and dried to give the product [DPyAM]Br2. 1H NMR (300MHz, D2O, TMS) δ (ppm)=3.402 (m, 4H, 2(–CH2)), 4.800 (m, 4H, 2(–CH2)), 8.476 (d, 4H, 4(–CH)), 9.036 (d, 4H, 4(–CH)). 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide ([Bmim]Br) and 1,1′-(butane-1,4-diyl)-bis(3-methylimidazolium) dibromide ([Dmim]Br2) were synthesized according to previous literatures [23,24]. [Bmim]Br 1H NMR (300MHz, D2O, TMS) δ (ppm)=0.912 (t, 3H, –CH3), 1.275 (m, 2H, –CH2), 1.779 (m, 2H, –CH2), 3.861 (s, 3H, –CH3), 4.174 (t, 2H, –CH2), 7.723 (d, 2H, –CH), 9.092 (s, 1H, –CH). [Dmim]Br2 1H NMR (300MHz, D2O, TMS) δ (ppm)=1.845 (m, 2H, –CH2), 3.912 (s, 3H, –CH3), 4.285 (m, 2H, –CH2), 7.726 (d, 2H, 2(–CH)), 9.060 (s, 1H, –CH). 2.2.2 DPyAM(H)-PW and control hybrid samples The obtained precursor [DPyAM]Br2 (7.0mmol) was added to an aqueous solution of H3PW12O40 (PW) (6.0mmol), then the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24h. The resultant precipitate was filtered and washed with water for three times, followed by a vacuum drying, to give the hybrid product DPyAM(H)-PW. The control hybrid samples, [Dmim]1.5PW, [Bmim]3PW, [CTA]3PW (CTA: cetyltrimethylammonium), were prepared according to the similar procedures using corresponding IL precursors. Elemental analysis results (by the weight percentage): [Dmim]1.5PW, found C 6.77%, N 2.41%, H 0.91%, calculated C 6.74%, N 2.60%, H 0.94%; [Bmim]3PW, found C 8.67%, N 2.44%, H 1.4%, calculated C 8.75%, N 2.55%, H 1.38%. DPyAM(H)-PMo (PMo: PMo12O40 3−) and DPyAM(H)-SiW (SiW: SiW12O40 4−) were synthesized by reacting [DPyAM]Br2 with H3PMo12O40 and H4SiW12O40, respectively. Elemental analysis results: DPyAM(H)-PMo, found C 8.03%, N 2.34%, H 1.22%, calculate C 8.13%, N 2.71%, H 1.02%; DPyAM(H)-SiW, found C 5.49%, N 1.87%, H 0.81%, calculated C 5.39%, N 1.80%, H 0.68%. The synthesis of the control hybrid MimAM(H)-PW with the amino-tethered imidazolium and the corresponding characterizations are described in detail in our recently published literature [20]. Also according to our previous report [25], the solid hybrid Dda3-PW was prepared by adding PW into an ethanol solution of dodecylamine with the molar ratio of amino to PW 3:1. The final white solid product was obtained by a filtration of the resulting precipitate, followed with a drying in a vacuum oven at 70°C for 12h. 2.3 Catalytic test For the oxidation of benzyl alcohol (Scheme 1 ), benzyl alcohol (10mmol) and catalyst DPyAM(H)-PW (0.1g, 0.03mmol) were added to a 50mL flask. Under conditions of reflux, vigorous stirring, and the heating temperature of 90°C, the aqueous H2O2 (30wt.%, 6mmol) was added into the above mixture within 5min, then the reaction mixture was stirred for another 30min. After reaction, the product mixture was analyzed by the gas chromatography (GC, SP-6890A) with a FID detector and a capillary column (SE-54 30m×0.32μm×0.30μm). Conversion=(mol benzaldehyde+mol benzoic acid)/mol initial H2O2. Selectivity=mol benzaldehyde/(mol benzaldehyde+mol benzoic acid). The concentration of H2O2 in the reacted mixture was determined by the titration with sodium thiosulfate (starch as indicator) in the presence of potassium iodide, sulfuric acid and ammonium molybdate. No remained H2O2 was detected, mostly due to the self-decomposition of H2O2 at 90°C accompanying with the oxidation of alcohol. The recovered catalyst for recycling tests was obtained by filtration, washing with ethanol and vacuum drying. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of DPyAM(H)-PW The elemental analysis for the new ionic hybrid DPyAM(H)-PW gave the data of C: 5.58%, N: 1.87% and H: 0.67% (by weight percentage), which is in agreement with the calculated theoretical value of C: 5.38%, N: 1.79%, and H: 0.71%. This result demonstrates the chemical formula of DPyAM(H)-PW indicated in Scheme 1, composed of a couple of ionically linked [DPyAMH]3+ cation and phosphotungstic anion. The TG analysis shown in Fig. 1 for the hybrid revealed a high thermal decomposition temperature of ca. 500°C. The drastical weight loss of nearly 7.0% in a temperature range 500–600°C corresponds to the thermal decomposition of the organic species in DPyAM(H)-PW. Moreover, the solid-state hybrid possesses a high melting point of above 250°C, and is nonsoluble in the common standard solvents, including DMSO and water. More importantly for this study, unlike most HPA-IL combinations, the hybrid is nonsoluble and undegradable in various alcohol/H2O2 reaction systems. Thus, the amino-containing dicationic ionic hybrid synthesized herein is feasible to act as a solid catalyst for the oxidation of alcohols in the presence of aqueous H2O2. 3.2 Oxidation of benzyl alcohol with H2O2 over DPyAM(H)-PW and various control catalysts In the oxidation of benzyl alcohol with aqueous H2O2, catalytic performances of DPyAM(H)-PW and various control catalysts under similar solventless conditions are compared in Table 1 . The dicationic hybrid DPyAM(H)-PW is observed to be a liquid–solid heterogeneous catalyst throughout the reaction, exhibiting a complete conversion of 100% with a rather high selectivity for benzaldehyde of 93.2% (entry 1). It is worth to note that this highly efficient transformation was obtained within a very short reaction time of 0.5h, and with a small amount of benzoic acid as the only byproduct. The recovery of the present solid catalyst DPyAM(H)-PW is easier than the previous liquid homogeneous and liquid biphasic HPA-based catalysts [3,26]. Furthermore, for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol, DPyAM(H)-PW exhibits a high activity with a TOF 350h−1, which is higher than the traditional homogeneous Venturello PW4 species (192h−1) [27], and the previous heterogeneous HPA catalysts, such as FePMoV (19h−1) [28], phosphomolybdic acid/vanadium aluminum mixed oxide (29h−1) [29], and Na6[SiW11ZnH2O40]·12H2O (277h−1) [30]. Our catalyst is only slightly lower in activity when compared with the phase-transfer catalyst [C7H7N(CH3)3]7PW11O39 with a TOF 430h−1 that is calculated by ourselves based on the published reaction data [31]. A series of organic HPA salts were prepared as the control catalysts by combining some more commonly used organic units with phosphotungstic acid. Though the two amino-free salts, [CTA]3PW (CTA: cetyltrimethylammonium) and [Bmim]3PW (Bmim: 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium), caused homogeneous reaction systems, they both showed much lower conversions (entries 2 and 3). Another amino-free imidazolium-based dicationic HPA salt [Dmim]1.5PW (Dmim: 1,1′-(butane-1,4-diyl)-bis(3-methylimidazolium)) behaved as a desirable heterogeneous catalyst, but exhibited the lowest conversion of 23.1% (entry 4). The totally amino-protonated sample Dda3-PW prepared by directly doping dodecylamine (Dda) with phosphotungstic acid is soluble in the reaction and offered a considerably higher conversion of 71.6% (entry 5) than the above amino-free salts did; however, it is far less active than DPyAM(H)-PW. Interestingly, the monocationic ionic hybrid catalyst MimAM(H)-PW (MimAM: 3-aminoethyl-1-methylimidazolium) containing mixed amino groups (–NH2 and –NH3 +), which we previously prepared for the epoxidation of alkenes [20], exhibited a dramatic increase of conversion up to 100% with the selectivity of 85.5% (entry 6). Nevertheless, MimAM(H)-PW cannot act as a heterogeneous catalyst in the present strong polar and oxidative reaction media and thus has difficulty in catalyst's isolation. Noticeably, all the control hybrids showed lower TOF values than the target catalyst DPyAM(H)-PW did. These comparisons strongly suggest that the amino groups in IL cations are indispensable for the high activity of the target hybrid catalyst DPyAM(H)-PW. Meanwhile, the featured structure of the dications endows the hybrid with the insolubility in the reaction media of alcohol oxidations, which is thus responsible for the liquid–solid heterogeneous catalysis system. When using Keggin 12-phosphomolybdic acid (PMo: H3PMo12O40) and 12-silicotungstic acid (SiW: H4SiW12O40) to replace PW in the preparation of the ionic hybrid catalyst, the resultant hybrids DPyAM(H)-PMo and DPyAM(H)-SiW are also insoluble throughout the oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol with H2O2, but the conversions were in extremely low levels (entries 7 and 8). Actually, the different catalytic activities resulted from different heteropolyanions with a similar organic modifier have been also observed previously [32]. It is known that the redox potential of a HPA-anion is closely relative to it s negative charge, and the more highly negative charged SiW has a weaker redox capability than PW [33], which accounts for the lower conversion of benzyl alcohol for DpyAM(H)-SiW than that for DPyAM(H)-PW. On the other hand, in epoxidations of alkenes with H2O2 over the MimAM(H)-PW catalyst, it has been demonstrated that the catalytically active terminal W species in PW-anion are greatly promoted by the strongly interacted amino functional groups tethered in organic IL-cations [20]. It is thus proposed that the high conversion of DPyAM(H)-PW for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol with H2O2 associates with the amino-terminal W interaction (also see Section 3.3 below). However, for DPyAM(H)-PMo, the functional amino groups most possibly locate nearby the bridging oxygen of PMo-anion [34], and would not effectively promote the redox property of Mo species. This is suggested to be the major reason for the low activity of DPyAM(H)-PMo. 3.3 Catalytic performances of DPyAM(H)-PW in the oxidation of other typical alcohols 1-Phenylethyl alcohol, cyclohexanol, and benzhydrol were also tested as the substrates over the catalyst DPyAM(H)-PW at the same solventless reaction conditions as those for benzyl alcohol, and the results are shown in Table 2 . For all those substrates, the exclusive 100% selectivity to corresponding aldehydes was obtained. For the oxidation of 1-phenylethyl alcohol (entry 2), a slightly higher TOF 362h−1 was obtained than that for benzyl alcohol. However, for benzhydrol (entry 3), a moderate conversion of 73.2% was got with a remarkably lowered TOF 137h−1, which may ascribe to the steric hindrance effect of the two phenol rings in substrate molecules. For cyclohexanol (entry 4), a biphasic liquid phase reaction system was formed due to the immiscibility of the substrate with aqueous H2O2, and the solid hybrid catalyst dispersed in the aqueous phase, whereby a drastically decreased TOF 93h−1 was observed. This is mostly because of the less accessibility of substrate molecules to catalyst's active sites. When the mixed solvent of CH3CN/H2O (volume ratio of CH3CN to H2O: 1:1) was added into the reaction media of cyclohexanol to make a monophasic liquid reaction with the solid catalyst being uniformly suspended therein, a greatly increased activity with a TOF 156h−1 was achieved (entry 5). So, under a solvent-free condition, the present hybrid catalyst is not applicable to the substrates that are immiscible with aqueous H2O2. 3.4 Understanding of the catalytic behavior of DPyAM(H)-PW UV–vis profiles of DPyAM(H)-PW and a amino-free hybrid [Bmim]3PW are compared in Fig. 2 . DPyAM(H)-PW showed a broad absorption band in the range of 600–1200nm that is assignable to the intramolecular charge transfer from the amino-tethered cations to PW anions [35], but the band was undetectable for the amino-free counterpart [Bmim]3PW. Moreover, the ESR signal at ca. 3500G in Fig. 3 confirms the existence of low valent W5+ species for DPyAM(H)-PW, whereas the amino-free [Bmim]3PW was silent in its ESR curve. These results strongly indicate the partial reduction of W6+ species in the HPA framework moiety of DPyAM(H)-PW, which arises from the transferred electrons from neighboring amino groups. Therefore, the catalytic oxidation properties of the W active species in PW anions should have been effectively modified by the electron transfer from the amino groups tethered in the divalent IL cations, which may directly associate with the high activity and selectivity of DPyAM(H)-PW for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol. Fig. 4 showed four characteristic IR bands for the Keggin structure of neat H3PW12O40 at wavenumbers of 1080, 979, 896, and 806cm−1 (curve a). However, for the hybrid DPyAM(H)-PW (curve b), the single P–O vibration at 1080cm−1 split into two bands at 1080 and 1047cm−1 due to the formation of hydrogen bonds among the terminal oxygen atoms of PW and amino groups of organic cations [36,37]. Moreover, the new band at 955cm−1 originally branched from 979cm−1 for WVI =O is assignable to the reduced W5+ species due to the intramolecular charge transfer from amino nitrogen to terminal oxygen of PW [38,39], which is well in agreement with the UV–vis and ESR results. Therefore, these IR results consolidate the evidence for the effective tuning of the oxidation property of W species in the hybrid through the intramolecular charge transfer for the amino groups to HPA frameworks, which again relates to the good performances in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol. The XRD patterns in Fig. 5 displayed a set of well resolved sharp diffraction peaks featured for the secondary crystal structure of the neat phosphotungstic acid; however, all these peaks disappeared in the case of DPyAM(H)-PW, indicating a definitely different noncrystal structure of the hybrid. This result is in agreement with the SEM image for DPyAM(H)-PW shown in Fig. 6 , which illustrated nano-sized particles with noncrystal-like unsharp profiles. It is suggested that the noncrystal-like nanoparticles are generated by the rearrangement of the parent crystal structure of phosphotungstic acid when the large organic dications are to replace the counter protons in the synthesis of the hybrid [40]. Moreover, the only broad Bragg reflection at the low angle of 8.6° in the XRD pattern implies the existence of very small gaps among cations and anions [40], which may facilitate the permeation of the polar alcohol substrates into the bulk of the hybrid. This proposal consists with the well-established viewpoint of “pseudo-liquid behavior” for the bulk-type catalysis of a HPA catalyst [41]. Additionally, HPAs are known to have low surface areas [2]. The control sample [Bmim]3PW has a very low specific surface area 9.8m2 g−1; however, it is soluble in the oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol. Thus its low activity is mainly relative to the unpromoted PW sites in the absence of amino groups. In contrast, as an insoluble solid catalyst, DPyAM(H)-PW has a specific surface area 18.5m2 g−1, though still not high, its catalytic activity for oxidation of benzyl alcohol is much higher than the [Bmim]3PW-catalyzed homogeneous system. These features again suggest a bulk-type catalysis mode for DPyAM(H)-PW (not a surface-type), wherein the amino-functionalized PW sites could fully play the roles as active centers for the reaction. It is also possible that the hydrophobic large divalent organic cations may enable the solubilization of the organic substrates therein without the aid of an additional solvent [42]. Thus, in terms of mass transfer, the hybrid's good catalytic performances under the solvent-free conditions are mostly because of the hydrophobic environment in bulk areas of the solid hybrid involving an organic moiety. 3.5 Catalyst reusability Because the hybrid behaves as a heterogeneous catalyst for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol with H2O2, after a reaction, the solid hybrid could be recovered and reused very conveniently. Table 3 showed the catalytic recycling property for DPyAM(H)-PW, revealing only a marginal decrease in conversion and selectivity. For the recovered catalyst DPyAM(H)-PW, the curve c of Fig. 4 showed the well reserved four featured IR bands for the Keggin structure of the HPA moiety, but their intensities decreased slightly, together with the disappearance of the shoulder band at 955cm−1. It is thus suggested that for a reused catalyst, the interaction between organic cations and heteropolyanions becomes weaker than that for the fresh catalyst. This observation may account for the marginal decrease of conversion for the recovered catalyst. Another possible reason for the slight deactivation that mainly happened during the second run is due to the slight leaching property of the ionic hybrid catalyst, especially when it is used as the fresh catalyst [43]. 4 Conclusion In summary, we have developed a unique recyclable HPA-based ionic hybrid catalyst for the solvent-free oxidation of benzyl alcohol with aqueous H2O2, by simply pairing amino-functionalized 4,4-bipyridine cations with Keggin-structured phosphotungstic anions. The hybrid catalyst shows high conversion and selectivity, easy recovery, and quite steady reuse. The efficient heterogeneous catalysis is attributed to the improved oxidation property of W species in HPA-anions through the intramolecular charge transfer from the amino functional groups, the hydrogen bonding network among dications and HPA-anions, and the hydrophobic environment in the bulk of the ionic hybrid.
