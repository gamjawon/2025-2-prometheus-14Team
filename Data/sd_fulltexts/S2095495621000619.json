Graphical abstract The carbon layers wrapped CoFe alloy (C/CoFe-30-650) exhibits high bifunctional catalysis for both ORR and OER, and the rechargeable ZABs with this catalyst has an excellent stability during 20,000 charging-discharging cycles. Developing high active and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for the development of rechargeable Zn-air batteries. Herein, a facile strategy to synthesize the porous carbon layers wrapped CoFe alloy (C/CoFe) through the pyrolysis of a homogeneous mixture containing Co, Fe ions and N-doped carbon quantum dots (N-doped CQDs) was reported. The prepared carbon layers with multi-level pore structures provides more active sites and optimizes the homogeneity of the electron and mass transport. In addition, the carbon layers, which is doped by Co/Fe/N atoms, is responsible for high ORR activity, while the CoFe alloy plays a vital role in OER performance. The as-synthesized catalyst exhibits an excellent bifunctionality for electrochemical oxygen reactions, which is comparable to the commercial Pt/C and IrO2 benchmarks. Owing to the carbon layers protects CoFe alloy nanoparticles from the harsh environment, the rechargeable Zn–air battery with the C/CoFe catalyst delivers excellent stability during 20,000 charging-discharging cycles. Keywords Rechargeable Zn-air battery Oxygen reduction reaction Oxygen evolution reaction Carbon materials CoFe alloy 1 Introduction Rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZABs) with the advantages of high specific capacity, cost effective and great security have attracted widely concerns as the candidate of renewable energy storage and conversion devices. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) takes place at the air electrode of ZABs when discharging, while the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurs during the charging process. In alkaline media, the ORR process is expressed as O2 + 2H2O + 4e-→4OH-, while the OER process is displayed as 4OH-→O2 + 2H2O + 4e- [1–4]. Since both ORR and OER are four-electron transfer processes with high activation energies, the performance of rechargeable ZABs is largely limited by the two sluggish kinetic processes at the air electrode [5–8]. Therefore, high active and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts which can accelerate both ORR and OER are essential to the development of ZABs. Noble metal materials, such as Pt or IrO2/RuO2, exhibit excellent performances towards the ORR or OER [9–12]. However, the scarce reserves and high prices limit their applications in large scales. Most importantly, the single noble metal materials cannot catalyze both ORR and OER processes effectively, i.e. Pt is the best ORR electrocatalyst but a poor OER electrocatalyst, while IrO2 and RuO2 are active for OER but not efficient towards ORR. A simple physical mixing between ORR and OER electrocatalysts does not work effectively during charging-discharging cycles. For instance, the high voltages in the OER process may deactivate ORR catalysts, such as the oxidation of Pt based electrocatalysts in some OER process [13–20]. Hence, cost-effective, highly active and durable bifunctional electrocatalysts are pursued by researchers. CoFe-based materials, especially CoFe alloy, have been found with good bifunctional activity in both ORR and OER processes as Co and Fe could be active sites [21–25]. Many papers had been published concerning on improving the catalytic activity and stability of bifunctional electrocatalysts, but few papers report a stability exceeding 2,000 charging-discharging cycles or 300 h [26–30]. Nevertheless, such a charging-discharging stability is still far below the requirement of practical applications. Carbon encapsulation is an effective strategy to enhance the stability of catalysts through protecting metal from oxidation [31]. The common strategies of creating carbon encapsulation have been widely reported such as template method and decomposition of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) [32,36]. Nevertheless, these conventional methods are sometimes accompanied by complex preparation or structural collapse [33,38]. In addition, too much introduction of carbon may decrease the content of metal. And this may affect the adsorption between oxygen species and active sites [31]. In addition, complex preparation processes were needed to get the thin carbon matrix. For example, ordered mesoporous silica (SBA-15) template was used to build single layer graphene encapsulating 3d transition metals [32–34]. Excess carbon matrix may be generated to affect mass and charge transfer through this strategy through the thermal decomposition of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) [35–38]. Herein, we introduced N-doped carbon quantum dots (CQDs) as the carbon source for the preparation of CoFe-based bi-functional catalysts. N-doped CQDs (diameter below 10 nm) are a new type of zero-dimensional approximately spherical carbon-based nanomaterials with good water solubility [39]. N-doped CQDs are also featured with facile heteroatom-doping (N, S, P et al.), surface functionalization (–OH, –COOH, –NH2 etc.) to uniformly anchor metal ions easily [40–43]. Thus, N-doped CQDs can be used as the building blocks to prepare the Carbon-Metal composite materials through N-doped CQDs complexing with metal ions homogeneously. The preparation procedure is simple and controllable without using templates owing to the small building blocks. We report a facile strategy to synthesize the porous carbon layers wrapped CoFe alloy (C/CoFe-x) through the pyrolysis of a homogeneous mixture containing Co, Fe ions and N-doped carbon quantum dots (N-doped CQDs). The as-synthesized catalyst exhibits an excellent bifunctionality for electrochemical oxygen reactions, which is comparable to the commercial Pt/C and IrO2 benchmarks. The CoFe alloy plays a vital role in OER performance, while Co/Fe/N-co-doped carbon layers are responsible for high ORR activity. Moreover, the micropores and mesopores of the carbon layers from N-doped CQDs precursors can optimize the homogeneity of the electron and mass transport. Especially, the rechargeable ZAB by this catalyst delivers excellent stability in long-term over 20,000 charging-discharging cycles since the obtained carbon layers protects CoFe alloy nanoparticles from the harsh environment. The high activity and long-term stability of the prepared catalysts may provide new vision for the development of Zn-air batteries. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Chemicals were all analytical grades purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The commercial IrO2 and 20 wt% Platinum loading on graphitized carbon were tested as the benchmarks in this paper. Ni foam was 1.5 mm in thickness from Shuzhou Jashide Co., Ltd. without further treatment. The Zn plate with a thickness of 0.5 mm was used as the anode of ZABs. 2.2 Sample preparation Preparation of N-doped CQDs: The N-doped CQDs were first prepared through a typical hydrothermal method using citric acid and ethylenediamine [39]. 18.0 g citric acids and 6.0 mL ethylenediamine were dissolved in 60 mL deionized water. Then, the solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave (100 mL) and heated at 180 °C for 5 h. After the reaction, the reactors were cooled to room temperature naturally. The product, which was brown-black and transparent, was dried at 120 °C in air circulation oven to obtain the N-doped CQDs. Preparation of catalysts: Fig. 1 a schematically depicts the synthesis process of C/CoFe-x. 0.15 g as-prepared N-doped CQDs was dissolved in 80 mL deionized water with vigorous magnetic stirring. 2.91 g Co(NO3)2·6H2O (1 mmol) and 4.04 g Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (1 mmol) were dissolved into 20 mL deionized water. Then, the Co(NO3)2/Fe(NO3)3 mixed solutions were added into the N-doped CQDs solutions at a constant rate with vigorous magnetic stirring. After stirring for 30 min, the solution was evaporated with vigorous magnetic stirring in air at 120 °C and then dried at 120 °C in air circulation oven. The dried mixtures were annealed at 650 °C for 2 h under 5% H2/Ar atmosphere (50 sccm) to get the C/CoFe-15–650. C/CoFe-30–650, C/CoFe-60–650 and C/CoFe-150–650 are prepared with different adding amounts of N-doped CQDs (0.30, 0.60 and 1.50 g), respectively. Similarly, the precursor of C/CoFe-30–650 was annealed at 500, 650 and 800 °C for 2 h under 5% H2/Ar atmosphere (50 sccm) to get the C/CoFe-30–500, 650 and 800, respectively. The first number in the abbreviation represents the amount of N-doped CQDs used for catalysts preparation and the second number represents the annealing temperature. For comparison, C/Co-30–650, C/Fe-30–650 and CQDs-650 were prepared with the similar procedure. Preparation of CoFe nanoparticles: 2.91 g Co(NO3)2·6H2O (1 mmol) and 4.04 g Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (1 mmol) were firstly dissolved in 80 mL deionized water with vigorous magnetic stirring, and then, 20 mL 1 M KOH solution was added into the above mixed solution. the resultant suspension was kept stirring for 30 min. After that, the suspension was washed by deionized water and dried at 60 °C in vacuum drying oven. Then, the dried mixture was annealed at 650 °C for 2 h under 5% H2/Ar atmosphere (50 sccm) to get CoFe nanoparticles. 2.3 Material characterizations High resolution scanning electron microscope (HRSEM) images and high-angle backscattering electron microscopy (HA-BSE) images were obtained using HITACHI S5500 instrument operating at 2.0 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging was performed on JEOL JEM-2100F and HITACHI HT7700 with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Scanning helium ion microscope (HIM) images were obtained using an ORION NANOFAB instrument. The crystalline structures, elemental distribution maps and an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) were acquired on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, FEI Tecnai F30) operated at 300 kV. Fluorescence spectroscopy was performed with a steady-state/transient fluorescence spectrometer (PTI, QM400). UV–vis absorption spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu 2600 UV–vis spectrophotometer. The infrared spectra were obtained at a Nicolet 6700 FTIR-ATR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy - Attenuated Total Reflection) spectrophotometer. The XRD measurements were performed on Empyrean-100 with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm at 40 kV and 200 mA). The data were recorded from 10° to 90° with an interval of 0.02° at a scan speed of 8°/min. Raman spectra were recorded by using a Raman-atomic force microscope imaging analysis system (Nano Wizard Ultra Speed & inVia Raman) with an incident wavelength of 532 nm. The samples were placed on a background-free glass slide. The acquisition time of the spectrum is 60 s. N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, BET surface area and pore size distribution were measured by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and NLDFT methods using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 Plus at 77.0 K. The horizontal axis was normalized with the vapor pressure of nitrogen (P 0) at 77.0 K (=0.101 MPa). Samples were heated at 150 °C under vacuum for 12 hours before the measurements. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) date were collected on a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi with Al Kα X-ray radiation (hυ = 1486.6 eV). 2.4 Electrochemical performance tests 5.0 mg catalyst and 5.0 mg Vulcan XC-72 were dispersed in a mixture solution of 2.00 mL isopropanol and 50 μL Nafion solution (5 wt%), and then the suspension was dispersed in an ultrasonic bath for about 30 min to form homogeneous ink. After that, 20 μL of the catalyst ink was loaded onto a rotating disk electrode (RDE) (Ф=5 mm) or rotating ring dick electrode (RRDE) (Ф disk = 5.6 mm, d ring = 1.0 mm), and then dried at room temperature. Before loading the catalyst, the glassy carbon electrode was polished with Al2O3 (particle size: 0.05 μm) paste, followed by thoroughly washing with deionized water and then ethanol. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were performed in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH through a conventional three-electrode electrochemical cell by using an electrochemical workstation based on a Solartron 1287 electrochemical interface and a Solartron 1260 frequency response analyser. All the electrochemical measurements were performed on the RDE or RRDE with loaded catalyst as working electrode, saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode and platinum foil (1.0 cm2) as counter electrode in 0.1 M KOH solution. Measurements were calibrated with respected to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The potential values were iR-corrected to eliminate the effect of solution resistance, which were calculated by the following equation: E iR-corrected = E-iR, where i is the current, and R is the ohmic resistance of electrolyte measured via high frequency ac impedance in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH. Impedance spectra were measured in a frequency range of 10-2 -105 Hz at five points per frequency decade with amplitude of 10 mV. To compare with other works, we calibrated the reference electrode with respect to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The RHE calibration was carried out in H2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution with platinum wire as the working electrode. The cyclic voltammetry was performed near the thermodynamic potential for the H+/H2 reaction at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1. The average of the two potentials at which the current passed through zero was treated as the potential of the hydrogen electrode reaction. E RHE = E SCE + 0.99 V. 2.5 Zn-air battery tests Liquid Zn-air batteries were assembled and tested by a homemade Zn-air cell. 10 mg catalyst and 10 mg Vulcan XC-72 were dispersed in mixture solution of 50 μL deionized water and 400 μL ethanol. After dispersed in an ultrasonic bath for about 15 min, 50 μL 10% PTFE solution was added in the suspension. Homogeneous ink after completely ultrasonic dispersion was brushed onto a 2 × 2 cm nickel foam as cathode. Then prepared cathode was annealed at 340 °C for 0.5 h under Ar atmosphere. A Zn plate with a thickness of 0.5 mm was used as the anode. 6 M KOH and 0.2 M Zn(CH3COO)2 was used as the electrolyte. The gas diffusion area is 1 cm2 for allowing O2 from air contact with the catalyst active sites. 3 Results and discussion The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the prepared N-doped CQDs is shown in Fig. 1b. The diameter of N-doped CQDs is in the range of 3–5 nm. More images and detailed characterizations about the N-doped CQDs are shown in the Supporting Information (Fig. S1). The nanoparticles of C/CoFe-30–650 shown in Fig. 1c-e with the diameter of mainly about 20–40 nm are wrapped by carbon layers and the carbon layers connect well with each other. The details of surface morphology can be seen from the scanning helium ion microscopy (HIM) image (Fig. 1c). Further information about the structural feature was displayed in the high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1f). Lattice fringe spacing of 0.20 nm and 0.34 nm were observed, respectively, corresponding to the (110) lattice plane of CoFe alloy and the (002) lattice plane of the graphitic carbon. According to the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) elemental distribution shown in Fig. S2, the nanoparticles should be made of CoFe alloy owing to the same distribution of Co and Fe. In addition, a high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM) and high-angle backscattering electron microscopy (HA-BSE) images from the same place were carried out to confirm the above conclusion. Metal elements with strong backscattered electron signal exhibit a brighter area whereas the part with carbon in the sample is darker on the HA-BSE image. The dark domain is ascribed to carbon material while the light area is ascribed to the CoFe alloy particles in the HA-BSE images. From the comparison between the upper and lower figures of Fig. 1d, the CoFe alloy nanoparticles were well wrapped by the carbon layers. Meanwhile the carbon layers well connect to form a porous structure. And the alloy particles become smaller and surround by more carbon layers with the increase of N-doped CQDs as shown in Fig. S3. In Fig. 2 a, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of CQDs-650 matches the (002) plane of graphite. The characteristic peaks in XRD patterns of CoFe nanoparticles match well with CoFe alloy (JCPDS No. 49–1568). The XRD pattern of C/CoFe-150–650 exhibits weak carbon characteristic peak and strong CoFe alloy characteristic peaks. The weak and broad peak at 26° matches the (002) plane of the graphitic carbon. The peaks at 44.75°, 65.4° and 82.4° correspond to (110), (200) and (211) planes of the CoFe alloy (JCPDS No. 49–1568) with a space group of Pm-3 m. The XRD pattern (Fig. S4) of C/Co-30–650 exhibits the characteristic peaks of Co, while that of C/Fe-30–650 exhibits the characteristic peaks of FeO and Fe, which indicates the oxidation of C/Fe-30–650 in air atmosphere. The surface areas and pore structures of the prepared catalysts were obtained by analyzing the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, as shown in Fig. 2b. The CQDs-650 and CoFe nanoparticles exhibit low specific area of 39.2 and 27.3 m2 g−1 according to the Brunauer − Emmett − Teller (BET) analysis, respectively, and large particle sizes (Fig. S5). The type IV isotherm curves and rapid nitrogen uptake (P/P 0 < 0.3) in C/CoFe-30–650, C/CoFe-60–650 and C/CoFe-150–650 confirm the existence of numerous micropores and mesopores. BET analysis shows the specific surface areas of the prepared catalysts increase from 5.05 to 270.6 m2 g−1 with the increase of N-doped CQDs loading (Table S1). This also matches with the TEM images shown in Fig. S3 that more carbon layers surround with the alloy particles with more adding amounts of N-doped CQDs. The hierarchical pore structure will facilitate the mass transport and expose more active surface sites for electrochemical reactions. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to detect the electronic state and the chemical environment of the surface elements. The results of C/CoFe-30–650 are shown in Fig. 2 as an example. The high-resolution C 1s spectra (Fig. 2c) could be fitted to three peaks at 288.4, 286.0 and 284.6 eV, assigned to C = O, C-N and C = C groups, respectively. Carbon-oxygen species, which are considered as the defects on the carbon layer, can facilitate the ORR process in alkaline media [44,45]. Moreover, the C = C groups are favorable for the electrocatalysis owing to the high electrical conductivity of sp2 -C. The appearance of C-N group indicates N was doped into the carbon materials, which was also confirmed by the existence of graphitic N peak in the high-resolution N 1s spectra (Fig. 2d). Three individual peaks were observed in the high-resolution N 1 s spectra at 401.48 eV, 400.18 eV and 398.44 eV, attributing to the graphitic N, pyrrolic N and pyridinic N, respectively. The existence of graphitic and pyridinic N modifies the local electronic structure of carbon materials and could accelerate the occurrence of 4-electron transfer pathway during the electrocatalysis according to previous researches [46]. Meanwhile, the graphitic and pyridinic N also provide abundant sites to anchor metal atoms. Thus, pyrrolic N and pyridinic N act as the active centers for ORR. Fe 2p spectrum (Fig. 2e) is ascribed to seven peaks, where Fe0 fitting peaks centered at 718.0 eV (Fe 2p 1/2) and 707.5 eV (Fe 2p 3/2), Fe2+ fitting peaks centered at 720.5 eV (Fe 2p 1/2) and 709.8 eV (Fe 2p 3/2), Fe3+ fitting peaks centered at 724.2 eV (Fe 2p 1/2) and 711.6 eV (Fe 2p 3/2), and a satellite peak appeared at 714.2 eV, respectively [47,48]. Fe with zero-valence ascribes the metallic Fe from the CoFe alloy. The presence of Fe2+ and Fe3+ indicates the binding of Fe-N species. Similarly, Co 2p spectrum (Fig. 2f) shows Co0 (794.1 eV, 778.6 eV), Co2+ (798.9 eV, 782.5 eV), Co3+ (796.5 eV, 780.5 eV) and two satellite peaks (803.1 eV and 785.7 eV), suggesting the existence of metallic Co from the CoFe alloy and Co-N species [49]. Overall, the XPS results confirm that the nanoparticle is CoFe alloy and carbon layer is co-doped by Co, Fe and N. The electrocatalytic performances of catalysts for both ORR and OER were evaluated using a typical three-electrode system in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH firstly and compared with commercial 20 wt% loading Platinum on graphitized carbon (Pt/C). The iR drops were corrected by the ohmic resistance of electrolyte measured via high frequency ac impedance in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH. As shown in Fig. 3 a and c, the CQDs-650 performs low catalytic activities in both ORR and OER processes. The CoFe nanoparticles delivers a good OER performance but an unsatisfied ORR activity. C/CoFe-30–650 exhibits the highest ORR performance with a high E onset of 0.97 V and a half-wave potential (E 1/2) of 0.81 V, comparable to those of Pt/C (0.98 V and 0.81 V) (Fig. 3a). Simultaneously, the ORR Tafel slope for C/CoFe-30–650 is as low as 51 mV dec-1, smaller than that for 20 wt% Pt/C (70 mV dec-1) (Fig. 3b), indicating a more favorable reaction kinetics in the ORR process for the C/CoFe-30–650 catalyst. In order to further investigate the electron transfer process in the ORR process, RRDE test was performed to evaluated the intermediate and number of electron transfers. The HO2 – % according to the RRDE test is under 20% and the number of electron transfers is around 3.6 (Fig. S6), which indicates that the four-electron transfer process is dominated in the ORR process. The catalytic stability of C/CoFe-30–650 was measured at 0.75 V vs RHE through a chronoamperometry method (Fig. S7). The current attenuation was less than 10% during the 15,000 s test. C/CoFe-30–650 also exhibits good OER performance with a potential of 1.58 V at the OER current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Ej =10 = 1.58 V), very close to that of IrO2 (Ej =10 = 1.56 V) (Fig. 3c). The lower Tafel slope of C/CoFe-30–650 indicates the C/CoFe catalysts have more favorable kinetics and better OER activity (Fig. 3d). The overpotentials of the C/CoFe catalysts and Pt/C for ORR (E 1/2 vs. 1.23 V) and OER (Ej =10 vs. 1.23 V) were summarized in Fig. 3f. The potential gap (ΔE = Ej =10 - E 1/2) is often used to evaluate the activity of bifunctional electrocatalysts. Generally, a smaller ΔE implies a better bifunctional catalytic activity. C/CoFe-30–650 exhibits an excellent bifunctional catalytic activity with the ΔE of 0.77 V, which is smaller than those of other as-prepared catalysts and Pt/C. The Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) plots are performed in Fig. 3e. Two series components (R ct1 Q 1 and R ct2 Q 2) were introduced to reveal the formation of the intermediate and the OER process on the equivalent electrical circuit. The R s represents the resistance between working and reference electrode. According to the fitted value listed in Table S2, C/CoFe-30–650 with the smallest value of R ct2 performs the fastest OER process among these catalysts. The increase trend of R ct1 indicates the harder transformation of the intermediates, which may be related with the increase of carbon layer [50]. The catalytic stability of C/CoFe-30–650 for OER was test through a chronopotentiometry method at 10 mA cm−2 shown in Fig. S7(c). The voltage remained stable during the 40,000 s test. Furthermore, density-functional theory (DFT) calculation was employed to demonstrate the origin of the high activity for C/CoFe-30–650 catalyst. Generally, the adsorption energies of O2 and OH– play a vital role in the ORR and OER activity, respectively. The (110) surface of CoFe alloy and Fe-N x -C site were constructed based on bulk CoFe alloy (Pm-3 m) and graphene slab, respectively (Fig. S8 and S9). Then, the O2 and OH– adsorption energies were calculated in the two models. The calculated results indicate that both O2 and OH– prefer to be adsorbed on the hollow site (Fe-Co-Fe) in CoFe alloy and the corresponding adsorption energies are −0.44 eV and −0.08 eV, respectively. In contrast, the adsorption energies of O2 and OH– on the Fe site in Fe-N x -C are −0.92 eV and 0.33 eV, respectively. Thus, the DFT results reveal that O2 is more likely to be adsorbed on Fe-N x -C while OH– is easier to be adsorbed on CoFe alloy (Fig. S10). The results are consistent with our experiment results that C/CoFe-30–650 deliver much higher ORR and OER activity than pure CoFe alloy and CQDs-650. Therefore, the active sites of the C/CoFe-30–650 for ORR and OER are different, i.e., the CoFe alloy plays the role of OER active sites and the Fe-N x -C between alloy and carbon layers act as the ORR active sites. The different active sites for ORR and OER in C/CoFe-30–650 provide high ORR and OER performance, simultaneously. Compared to N-doped CQDs-650 and CoFe nanoparticles, the superior ORR and OER bifunctional catalytic activity of C/CoFe-30–650 is probably ascribed to the synergistic effect between the well-connected porous Co/Fe/N-doped carbon layers and highly dispersed CoFe alloy nanoparticles. Thanks to the carbon layers modified with CoFe atoms, C/CoFe-30–650 delivers much better ORR activity than N-doped CQDs-650. In addition, the hierarchical pore structure of carbon layers in C/CoFe-30–650 facilitates the mass transport and exposes more active surface sites for electrochemical reactions. Rising the calcination temperature could improve the graphitization degree of carbon and charge transfer. Meanwhile, it may also cause carbon loss and more defects owing to the abundant functional groups of N-doped CQDs. In addition, the CoFe alloy nanoparticles may grow up at high calcination temperature. Accordingly, we tuned the calcination temperature to balance the two factors, aiming to obtain excellent electrochemical performance. C/CoFe-30–500, C/CoFe-30–650 and C/CoFe-30–800 were prepared by calcining the precursor of C/CoFe-30 in 5% H2/Ar atmosphere at 500, 650 and 800 °C for 2 h, respectively. Raman spectroscopy is a promising method to characterize the structure and defects of materials. The D-band positioned at near 1360 cm−1 corresponds to the structural defects on the in-plane breathing vibrations of sp2-bonded carbon, while the G-band at near 1580 cm−1 reveals the degree of crystallization (or graphitization) [51,52]. The intensity ratios between D-band and G-band (I D /I G) at 500, 650 and 800 °C are 1.03, 1.16 and 1.34, respectively (Fig. 4 a). The relative increase of the I D /I G reveals that more defects are exposed at high calcination temperature. This may be induced by the decomposition of functional groups of N-doped CQDs at high calcination temperature. The elemental content analysis of C/CoFe-30–500, 650 and 800 (Table S3) showed that the carbon content of catalysts decreases with the increasing calcination temperature, suggesting the decomposition of carbon on the other hand. As shown in Fig. 4b, diffraction peaks indexed to CoFe alloy are observed for the three samples and become sharper with the increase of the calcination temperature, indicating the gradual increase of the particle size of CoFe alloy. According to the TEM images (Fig. S11), the particle size of CoFe alloy gradually increased from ca. 5–15 nm to ca. 60–100 nm with the increase of pyrolysis temperature from 500 to 800 °C. N2 adsorption/desorption isothermal experiments were conducted to investigate the specific surface area as well as the pore structure. As shown in Fig. 4c, the catalysts calcined at 500, 650 and 800 °C have high BET specific surface area of 114.5, 130.6 and 119.2 m2 g−1, respectively. The rapid N2 uptake (P/P 0 < 0.1) of the isotherm curve for the three samples confirms the existence of numerous micropores. Micropores and mesopores are observed in C/CoFe-30–650 and C/CoFe-30–800 (Fig. S12). The mesopores in the carbon layers would facilitate the mass transfer and provide more active sites of electrocatalytic process. With the calcination temperature increases, graphitization degree is improved accompanied by the increase in mesopore size/amount of the carbon layers and the size of CoFe alloy nanoparticles. The influence of the calcination temperature on ORR and OER activities was evaluated by LSV tests in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 4d, the catalysts exhibit good ORR performance with the E 1/2 of 0.68 V, 0.81 V and 0.81 V at 500, 650 and 800 °C, respectively. The catalysts also exhibit excellent OER performance with the Ej =10 of 1.67 V, 1.58 V and 1.60 V at 500, 650 and 800 °C, respectively. The ORR and OER performance of the C/CoFe-30–500 are significantly lower than those of C/CoFe-30–650 and 800, which may result from the low degree of graphitization and conductivity. Compared to C/CoFe-30–650, the lower activity of C/CoFe-30–800 was related to the decrease of active sites resulting from the growth of CoFe alloy nanoparticles. To further evaluate the bifunctional activity and stability, conventional rechargeable aqueous ZABs were assembled (Fig. 5 a). C/CoFe-30–650 as the best bifunctional electrocatalyst for ORR and OER was systematically studied as the air electrode with a loading amount of 1.55 mg cm−2. The open-circuit voltage of ZAB with C/CoFe-30–650 (1.46 V) is higher than that with CoFe alloy nanoparticles (1.38 V). As shown in Fig. 5b, the ZAB with CoFe alloy nanoparticles as the air electrode exhibits similar charging and discharging curves to those with C/CoFe-30–650 at a low current density (<20 mA cm−2), while a smaller voltage gap can be achieved on the ZAB with C/CoFe-30–650 at high current density (>60 mA cm−2). The peak power density of C/CoFe-30–650 is 167.4 mW cm−2, higher than that of CoFe nanoparticles (Fig. 5c). To study the cycling durability, a charging-discharge test was performed for 100 cycles with 20 minutes per cycle (discharge 10 min and charge 10 min). As shown in Fig. 5d, the performance of ZAB with C/CoFe-30–650 keeps stable in the 100 cycles, whereas the performance of the ZAB with CoFe alloy nanoparticles degrades significantly. These results indicate the carbon layers can protect CoFe alloy nanoparticles from degradation. Due to the appearance of carbon layers, only small amount of OH–/H2O can contact CoFe alloy. Compared to directly soaking in electrolyte, the small amount of contact with OH–/H2O can limit the corrosion of OH–/H2O to the CoFe alloy. Charging-discharging cycles at different current densities (from 2-50 mA cm−2) were tested on the ZAB with C/CoFe-30–650 air electrode (200 s per cycle, discharge 100 s and charge 100 s). As shown in Fig. 5e, the ZAB remains stable even at a large charging-discharging current density of 50 mA cm−2 in 100 cycles, indicating the catalyst with carbon layers has good durability under a large current density. Furthermore, a long-term charging-discharging test was performed to test the stability of the C/CoFe-30–650 air electrode at 10 mA cm−2 with 200 s per cycle. The ΔV between charge voltage and discharge voltage of the rechargeable ZAB reaches 0.7 V after 20 cycles and remains stable during 20,000 cycles over 1100 hours (Fig. 5f). Specifically, the ZAB assembled by CoFe-30 performs a good durability at 10 mA cm−2 with 20 min per cycle over 2,000 cycles while the Pt/C-based batteries fail quickly less than 200 cycles (Fig. S13). The performance of C/CoFe-30–650 was compared with the reported catalysts shown in Table S4, showing that C/CoFe-30–650 exhibits high activity and excellent durability. ZABs with C/CoFe-30–650 as the bifunctional air electrode perform such high activity and excellent durability, indicating that the porous carbon layers can provide more active sites from graphite carbon, and optimize the homogeneity of the electron and mass transport together with prevent the CoFe alloy nanoparticles from the corrosion of the harsh environment. Therefore, the catalyst composed of CoFe alloy nanoparticles enwrapped by porous carbon layers is prospective as the bifunctional electrocatalyst for rechargeable ZABs. 4 Conclusions In summary, we have constructed the carbon layers wrapped CoFe alloy through calcinating homogeneous mixture of the Co, Fe ions and N-doped CQDs. Both the N-doped CQDs loading and graphitization degree of carbon layers were systematically optimized. The optimal catalyst of CoFe-30 exhibited superior both ORR and OER electrocatalytic activities with low overpotential and Tafel slope. Meanwhile, the rechargeable ZABs using CoFe-30–650 air cathode exhibited high open-circuit voltage and excellent long-time charge–discharge cycle stability. Carbon layers can improve both the electrocatalytic activity and stability through providing more active sites and optimizing the homogeneity of electron and mass transport together with preventing the corrosion of the CoFe alloy nanoparticles in the harsh environment. The facile strategy for the preparation of carbon layers wrapped CoFe alloy presented a new perspective for the development of CoFe-based bifunctional electrocatalysts.

        "dc:description": "Developing high active and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for the development of rechargeable Zn-air batteries. Herein, a facile strategy to synthesize the porous carbon layers wrapped CoFe alloy (C/CoFe) through the pyrolysis of a homogeneous mixture containing Co, Fe ions and N-doped carbon quantum dots (N-doped CQDs) was reported. The prepared carbon layers with multi-level pore structures provides more active sites and optimizes the homogeneity of the electron and mass transport. In addition, the carbon layers, which is doped by Co/Fe/N atoms, is responsible for high ORR activity, while the CoFe alloy plays a vital role in OER performance. The as-synthesized catalyst exhibits an excellent bifunctionality for electrochemical oxygen reactions, which is comparable to the commercial Pt/C and IrO2 benchmarks. Owing to the carbon layers protects CoFe alloy nanoparticles from the harsh environment, the rechargeable Zn–air battery with the C/CoFe catalyst delivers excellent stability during 20,000 charging-discharging cycles.",
