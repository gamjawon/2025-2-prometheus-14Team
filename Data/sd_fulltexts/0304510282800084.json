PETIT Laboratoire de Chirriie Organique Appliquee, ERA C_N_R.S. 458, S_P_ 108, 69652 Villeneuve d Ascq Cedez (France) Summary Homogeneous metathesis of disubstiiuted alkynes is performed catalyt- ically on new 02-Mo(acac)2 ALEt3 PhOH combinations. These systems are much more efficient than the L.,Mo(CO),,-PhOH catalysts which re quire thermal activation; activities as high as 16 800 h7l are reached at 110 C, with entire selectivities in acetylenic hydrocarbons without isom erization. A mechanism is proposed, in which the role of phenol is to interact with the triple bond and to enha<ice alkyl scrambling in metal lacyclobutadiene intermediates for metathesis compound production. Introduction Homogeneous metathesis of disubstituted alkynes has already been performed on molybdenum type catalysts, in which the metal is initially in a low oxidation state, e.g. Mo(CO)6 and (Mes)Mo(CO)3, in the presence of phenolic reagents as cocatalysts [1 - 5] _ [' bf o'1/PhOH 2R1-C=--C-RZ z == Ri--C=C-Rf + R2--G~-R2 Since it is well known that active species for metathesis of olefinic hydrocarbons are generated from both low and high oxidation state transition metal precursors [6] , it seemed to us of interest, during our investigations of the mechanism of the above reaction, to look for new catalytic systems arising from other low oxidation state complexes of molybdenum L.Mo(CO),, and especially from higher oxidation state Group VI B salts, reduced by aluminium, alkyls. Although early attempts in this direction with WCls and MoC15 [7] failed before our discovery of the `Mn(CO)s-PhOH' combination, this paper will show that the most active systems obtained so far are produced by this reduction method; we will try therefore to define the mechanistic implications of this catalytic reaction. *Author to whores correspondence should be addressed- 0304-5102/82/0000-0000/$02.75 EIsevier Sequoia/Frinted in The Netheriands 94 Experimental Preparation o f catalysts PPh3Mo(CG)5 [8] , (NBD)Mo(CO)c [91, (cycloheptatriene) Mo(CO)3 [10] and (1,3-cyclohexadiene)2Mo(CO)2 [I1] were prepared and purified according to the literature. Reactants The typical hydrocarbon used in this series of experiments is 4-nonyne, purchased from rarchan . This hydrocarbon, as well as toluene and nonane, was freed from peroxides and water by distillation from CaH2 under nitrogen- Catalytic reactions with L.,Mo(CO), The catalytic tests were conducted under nitrogen in a 20 ml roundbottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser. After introduction of phenol (94 mg, 1 mmol), toluene (8.75 ml) and 4-nonyne (0.16 ml, I mmol) by means of a hypodermic syringe, the reactor was heated to 110 C in a thermostatted oil bath. The catalyst was then introduced in solution (1 ml, i0-2 mmol) and the products collected at regular intervals for analysis. Catalytic reactions with reduced systems The catalyst was prepared in toluene during 5 min at ambient temperature by interaction between the transition metal salt and the organoaluminium compound in order to obtain a 10-2 M solution. One and of this solution was injected at the desired temperature into the reaction flask containing 9 ml of a toluene solution of 4-nonyne (I mmol) and phenol (1 mmol). Aliquots were collected at regular intervals and poured immediately into a 20% NaOH solution in order to stop the reaction and eliminate the phenolic reagent into the aqueous phase. Analysis Conversion (r) and selectivities were determined by gas phase chromatography using z 3 m X 0.32 mm 1090 SE 30 column, with nonane as internal standard. The activities were obtained from the initial slope in the curves r = f(t), and expressed as turnover rates, moles of substrate transformed per mole of catalyst per hour. Results L.Mo(Css)Y catclysts As shown in Table 1, sever. LrMo(CO) complexes can be used as catalytic precursors for metathesis of 4-nonyne, some of them exhibiting activities higher than Mo(CO)s. 95 TABLE 1 Activity of different LrMo(CO)y PhOH catalysts.

These results are summarized in `??able 3 and show that maximum activity is practically reached for an Al/Mo ratio of 6, and is already better at 30 C than the most active L_Ma(CO)y type catalyst at 110 C.

Within the range 0 - 110 C. selectivity in 4-nonyne and 5-decyne metathesis is not affected at all by this new 02Mo(acac)2 AlEt3 PhOH (1/6/100) system, so that an activation energy of 8.2 + 1 kcal/mol can be calculated from an Arrhenius plot. A system has been optimized at 110 C and gave initial rates of 3480 h-1 with a [CEiU] /[Mo] ratio of 100 (Al/Mo = 3) and 16 800 h-1 with a [C.-=C] /[Mo] ratio of 1000 (Al/Mo = 6), the equilib rium being reached in each case within 5 min. Effect of phenol on tta reaction From the former study on the Mo(CO)s PhOH catalytic combination [2] , a first-order rate in [PhOH] has been observed. Here again, the absence of phenol completely inhibits metathesis, the starting material remaining unchanged. The results in Table 4 indicate that a first-order rate law can be considered again with this system. TABLE 4 Effect of phenol concentration on the metathesis rate.

Nature of the reducing agent At 60 C under the same conditions with 02Mo(acac)2, trimethyl aluminium, triisobutylaluminium and bis(isobutyl)aluminiumhydride, all of low Lewis acidity, give catalytic mixtures of good efficiency (Table 5). Nevertheless, AlEt2Cl, AlEtC12, ZnEt2, 3nMe4, NaBH4 and LiAlH4 are totally inefficient. TABLE 5 Effect of the nature of reducing agents on rate of metathesis of 4-nonyne.

Discussion LsMo(COj catalytic precursors As expected from our first experiments in this field, and those conducted later on by Devajaran and coworkers [5] , all molybdenum carbonyl complexes mentioned in this study are active for alkyne metathesis. Thermal or photochemical [31 labilization of carbon monoxide to give unsaturated Moo species is certainly one of the initial processes necessary to provide the catalytic moieties. Such an assumption can be further evidenced by other experiments made on a Chatt-type complex, obtained by reduction of molybdenyl acetylacetonate with AlEt3 in the presence of dppe under nitrogen [13] ; one obtains a yellow-orange complex, exhibiting an infrared -tN=N band at 1985 cm-I. This dinitrogen complex is slightly less active than the preceding ones, as \"a turnover rate of 78 h-I is observed at 110 C, but promotes metathesis at lower temperature (90 C). These results show.that (i) carbonyl groups are not necessary to obtain metathesis catalysts; (ii) vacant coordination sites can be provided from dinitrogen complexes omolybdenum, probably by easy removal of this labile liga!d by the acetylenic substrate. Catalysts of this type have already been used for metathesis of olefins in the presence of AlBr3 [141 . From these observations, an in situ preparation of a new system was investigated, starting directly from catalytic amounts of 02Mo(acac)2 (0.1 mmol), AlEt3 (0.2 mmol) and diphenylphosphinoethane (0.2 mmol) which converted 4-nonyne (1 mrnol) with equimolar amounts of phenol in toluene (10 ml) at 80 C to an equilibrium mixture of 4-octyne and 5-decyne within 30 min. High oxidation state catalytic precursors Reduction of molybdenum salts by an excess of AlEt3 must lead to 98 low oxidation levels of metal (Mo(acac)3 is reduced to Mo during the preparation of Chatt's complea [ 13] ), but there is also the possibility of producing carbene moieties of the L ivloC,CH 3 type, arising from a-hydride elimination in a1_kylmolybdenum complexes [15] . If such a carbene is formed during reduction of the molybdenum salt, a mechanism involving metallacyclobutenes as intermediates, already proposed during the initiation step of polymerisation of alkynes on tungsten carbene complexes [16] would be particularly attractive: H \"R + rH--PhoH MG PhOH R RI PhCH re u R P 0'(' RI YP R2 Scheme 1. Metallocarbene-type mechanism for alkyne metathesis In this scheme, one can suggest that the acidic phenol reagent might have several roles: (i) Through intermolecular hydrogen bonding [3] , the triple bond character is weakened, so that the hydrocarbon is rendered much more olefinic in nature; this function should be particularly efficient at avoiding side reactions such as polymerisation [16] or cyclotrimerisation. (ii) A destabilising effect on the transient metallacyclobutenes is a consequence of the above assumption. (iii) Scrambling of the alkyl units in the metallacyclobutenes can also be achieved by the iicidic character of this essential `cocatalyst'. The intervention of such intermediates is supported by recent investigations on titanacyclobutene compounds, which are now easily prepared by interaction of the potential metallocarbene 'Tebbe' reagent Cp2TiCH2AIMe2Cl and disubstituted acetylenes [17] . However, an alternative mechanism could be envisaged if one considers that metallocarbynes are formed during the initiation process [18] R R R R, R PfiI H N + ~OH ~ ~ eRo 2 Rz R2 Me.athasis Campaaods WE= -R2 f R-Sip -Fl, PhVH Scheme 2. Meialloczrbyne-type mechanism for al_kyne meiakhesis 99 Here again, the phenolic co-catalyst would be necessary to induce isomerisation of the metallacyclobutadiene intermediates; proton addition to the metallacyclobutadiene 1 would be able to give t cationic ,r-allyl complex intermediate which further rearranges to 2. Unless alkylmolybdenum carbene and carbyne complexes are prepared and shown to be catalytically active of inert under these conditions, we cannot decide whether the process is initiated by metallocarbene or carbyne moities. In this context, attempts to catalyse metathesis of 4-nonyne with phenol a; co-catalyst, by the phenyltungsten carbyne complex Cl(CQ)4W-=C-CsHs (prepared in situ by interaction of the carbene complex (CG)5EVC(OCH3)Cr.H5 v:ith Czf-I5AlC12 [19]) have failed. However, this experiment cannot exclude the carbyne mechanism, as only little activity was found with `V(CO) Clz as catalytic precursor ('Fable 6). Carbyne complexes might be present in the Cr(acac)3 AIEt3 catalyst system, since mixtures of phenyl and p-tolyl chromium carbyne complexes have been shown to decompose to give the `metathesis' compounds tolan, phenyl p-tolylacetylene and dip-tolylacetylene [20] . This `coupling' reaction did not take place with tungsten carbyne complexes under the same conditions. Coming back to the `carbene' type mechanism depicted in Scheme 1, one can assume that if the yield of initial carbene is reasonably good, this should induce the production of initial by-products; if R is a methyl radical, one should observe at the early stage of the reaction at least 2-pentyne and 2-hexyne, if catalysis is performed with 4-nonyne as the substrate. Unfortunately in our hands, we have not been able to detect any of these compounds at low conversion, even with large amounts of catalysts (C~;CJMo = 5). So, whatever is the mechanism, a question arises concerning the initiation step of this reaction, which could also be applied to molybdenum carbonyl complexes, where no reducing agents are required- The answer is not clear, but the absence of initial acetylenic by-products favours somewhat the carbyne-type mechanism. These carbyne species could be made directly by interaction of the molybdenum unsaturated moieties with the alkyne in the presence of phenol, so that the alkylcarbyne groups immediately undergo productive metathesis. Finally, one must also keep in mind that if such mechanisms are consistent with labelling experiments [4] , these metallocyclic pathways cannot exclude other reaction schemes in which cyclobutadienic complexes might intervene: flash vacuum pyroxysis of substituted :14-cyclobutadiene q5-cyclopentadienyl cobalt complexes produces metathesis products [21] ,whereas an asymmetrically tetrasubstituted cyclobutadiene molybdenum complex requires phenol to thermally decompose into metathesis products at equilibrium [221. *We thank Dr. Y. Chauvin for a generous gift of this complex. 1 017 Conclusion The above results show that efficient catalytic systems for alkyne metathesis can be provided by reduction of molybdenum salts by aluminium alkyls, giving rise to activities very much higher than with molybdenum carbonyls i.,Mo(r0),. In any case, it is found that a phenolic co-catalyst is essential to induce productive metathesis, so that this co-catalyst must be taken in account in the proposed mechanism(s). From the present data, and infrared spectroscopic results [3] , one can suggest that the primary role of phenol is to remove some acetylenic character of the substrate, through hydrogen bonding with the triple bond. A second determining role is assigned to this particular reagent, which is to make possible the scrambling of the alkyl units in the suggested metallacyclobutadiene intermediates. This hypothesis is presently the subject of further work. Electrochemical investigations [23] of these new systems are also in progress in order to elucidate the initiation step in this reaction and confirm the critical role of phenol in these highly active catalytic combinations- Acknowledgements We are deeply indebted to Mrs- F.

        "dc:description": "Homogeneous metathesis of disbustituted alkynes is performed catalytically on new O2Mo(acac)2AlEt3PhOH combinations. These systems are much more efficient than the LxMo(CO)yPhOH catalysts which require thermal activation; activities as high as 16 800 h−1 are reached at 110 °C, with entire selectivities in acetylenic hydrocarbons without isomerization. A mechanism is proposed, in which the role of phenol is to interact with the triple bond and to enhance alkyl scrambling in metallacyclobutadiene intermediates for metathesis compound production.",
