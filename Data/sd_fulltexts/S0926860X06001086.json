Vapor-phase oxidative carbonylation of ethanol over CuCl–PdCl2/C catalyst Tuan-Chi Liu ⁎ Chung-Shin Chang National Taiwan University of Science and Technology 43, Keelung Rd. Section 4, Taipei 106, Taiwan, ROC ⁎ Corresponding author. CuCl–PdCl2/C catalysts were prepared, characterized, and used for the synthesis of diethyl carbonate. Conventional impregnation was adopted for the preparation of the catalyst. Water-insoluble cuprous chloride, CuCl, was dissolved in hydrochloric acid. Catalytic properties were characterized by XRD, XPS and TPD. The activities of the catalysts in the oxidative carbonylation of ethanol were measured using a continuous flow micro-reactor. The results revealed that CuCl–PdCl2/C catalyst was not only active but also very selective for the production of diethyl carbonate. The selectivity was 100% at a reaction temperature below 120°C. However, despite all its merits, the catalyst was easily deactivated in the reaction. The main causes of the deactivation were the sintering of the cuprous chloride and the decomposition of the palladium chloride. Keywords Diethyl carbonate Cuprous chloride catalyst Oxidative carbonylation, Palladium chloride 1 Introduction Due to its diversified chemical properties, diethyl carbonate, (C2H5O)2CO, has many applications. The carbonyl group makes the carbonate an excellent carbonylation agent for the manufactures of pharmaceutics, plastics, fine chemicals, paint and fragrance [1]. The carbonate may also be used in the battery industry as an electrolyte solution [2]. The high octane number of the carbonate makes it a fine replacement to MTBE as a gasoline additive. MTBE is currently the most widely used gasoline additive. However, recent studies indicate that the application of MTBE is not safe. Exposure to the chemical for a long period of time may lead to cancer [3]. Comparing to MTBE, diethyl carbonate is more environment-friendly. The carbonate decomposes easily to ethanol and carbon dioxide when released into the atmosphere. The high oxygen content is another merit of the compound as a gasoline additive. The oxygen enhances the combustion in an internal combustion engine and reduces the emissions [4]. Dimethyl carbonate is the most widely studied dialkyl carbonate. The carbonate may be produced from methanol, carbon monoxide, and oxygen in the presence of a catalyst. A commercial process developed by Enichem uses cuprous chloride as the catalyst. The catalyst can convert methanol, carbon monoxide and oxygen to dimethyl carbonate in liquid-phase. Supported catalysts have also been attempted. Activated carbon-supported cupric chloride is the one most often used [5–7]. Palladium chloride is a good promoter for CuCl2/C catalyst. Other compounds, such as CH3COOK [8–11] and KOH [4,12,13], are also found to have promoting effects for the catalyst. In this study, CuCl–PdCl2/C catalyst was prepared for the synthesis of diethyl carbonate. Rarely has this catalyst been examined before, due possibly to the low solubility of cuprous chloride in water. Most previous study employed water-soluble cupric chloride to prepare the required catalysts. In preparing CuCl–PdCl2/C catalyst for this investigation, we overcame the low solubility problem by dissolving cuprous chloride in hydrochloric acid. The resulting catalyst not only had high activity in the oxidative carbonylation of ethanol but also had extremely high selectivity for the desired product, diethyl carbonate. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The catalysts reported in this article were prepared by incipient impregnation using activated carbon (Stream, 7440-44-0) as the support. Anhydrous cuprous chloride, containing 95% CuCl, and palladium chloride of 59wt.% purity were purchased from ACROS. In the preparation of CuCl/C catalyst, cuprous chloride was first carefully weighed and dissolved in hydrochloric acid. Activated carbon of known weight was then impregnated with the solution. The resulting slurry was dried at 110°C overnight and calcined at 300°C for 4h to finish the preparation. The CuCl/C catalyst thus obtained contained 10wt.% cuprous chloride. CuCl–PdCl2/C catalyst was prepared by impregnating CuCl/C in an aqueous solution of palladium chloride. The resulting slurry was then dried at 110°C and calcined at 400°C for 3h. The catalyst thus obtained contained 1wt.% palladium chloride. 2.2 Catalyst characterization 2.2.1 X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) XRD analyses were conducted on a Rigadu X-ray diffractometer (Model Ru-200B). The working voltage for the analyses was 40kV and the working current was 100mA. The light source was Cu Kα (λ =0.15418nm). Samples were scanned from 10° to 60° at a rate of 5°/min. The crystalline phases were identified by using the JCPDS data bank. 2.2.2 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) XPS analyses were performed on a VG spectrometer (VG-MT500). The chamber pressure was 1.0×10−8 Torr. The X-ray beam (Mg Kα with λ =0.9889nm) for the analyses was generated by bombarding an Mg target with electrons of 1253.6eV. The C 1s line, with a binding energy of 285.0eV, was adopted as the internal reference. Double-sided adhesive tape was used to hold the sample onto a specimen holder. The sample was degassed at 1.0×10−10 Torr overnight at room temperature before it was transferred to the analysis chamber. 2.2.3 Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) Temperature programmed desorptions (TPD) were conducted from 50 to 300°C. The experiments were carried out for all reactants, CO, O2 and C2H5OH. In performing the experiments, we first degassed each catalyst sample (0.2g) at 300°C under helium flow (10ml/min) for an hour. The adsorption of CO, O2 or C2H5OH was then followed at 50°C. After the adsorption, the sample was heated again at a ramping rate of 10°C/min under helium flow. The gases released from the sample were continuously monitored by a thermal conductivity detector. 2.3 Catalyst activity The activities of the catalysts were measured using a continuous flow micro-reactor. In each experiment, the reactor was loaded with 0.5g (0.25cm3) of catalyst. The reaction was carried out under atmospheric pressure using a feed consisting of 9.0mol% C2H5OH, 70.8mol% CO and 20.2mol% O2. The total flow rate was 6.86×10−2 mol/h. Of the reactants, ethanol was fed by a syringe pump while carbon monoxide and oxygen flowed from gas cylinders. The flow rates of the two gases were controlled by mass flow controllers. The effluent stream from the reactor was sampled and analyzed by a GC-FID. The column was SUPELCO carbowax 80/120 mesh 6′×1/8″ stainless steel. The temperature of the column was maintained at 130°C. Diethyl carbonate (DEC) and acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) were the only organic products detected in the effluence stream. The conversion of ethanol (X) and the selectivity of diethyl carbonate (S) were defined as follows: X = F A 0 − F A F A 0 × 100 % ; S = 2 F B F A 0 − F A × 100 % ; where F A0 is the feed rate of ethanol (mol/min); F A the effluent rate of ethanol (mol/min); F B the effluent rate of diethyl carbonate (mol/min). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 XRD The XRD patterns of fresh and spent CuCl–PdCl2/C catalysts are shown in Fig. 1 . The growth in the sizes of CuCl (2θ =28.54°, 47.48°and 56.34°) and Pd (2θ =40.118° and 46.658°) crystals during the reaction is obvious, showing that the surface of the CuCl–PdCl2/C catalyst is reconstructed constantly during the reaction. The peaks at 2θ =20° and 22° are identified as the crystalline phases of the wax used to hold the sample to the sample holder. 3.2 XPS Fig. 2 shows the XPS spectra of the chlorides of fresh and spent CuCl–PdCl2/C catalysts. The peak with a binding energy of 201eV is identified as the Cl−1 (2P3/2) of CuCl. The height of the peak is about the same for the fresh and the spent catalysts, implying that the cuprous chloride stays on the catalyst even after the catalyst is on stream for 48h. The situation for the palladium chloride is quite different. The peak with a binding energy of 198.9eV is identified as the Cl−1(2P3/2) of PdCl2. The height of this peak shrinks with the time the catalyst is on stream. This observation illustrates that the palladium chloride continuously loses its chlorine while the catalyst is on stream. The loss results in the formation of metallic palladium which gradually sinters into large crystals during the reaction (Fig. 1). The XPS spectra of the copper on the fresh and the spent catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 . The figure reveals that monovalent Cu+ (2P3/2, 932.5eV), instead of bivalent Cu2+, is the dominant copper species on these catalysts. 3.3 TPD The patterns of desorption of oxygen from CuCl–PdCl2/C catalysts are shown in Fig. 4 . Most of the oxygen on the catalyst is desorbed at around 150°C, regardless the time the catalyst is on stream. However, the amount of oxygen that can be adsorbed by CuCl–PdCl2/C catalyst depends on the time the catalyst is on stream. A fresh catalyst and the catalyst that has been on stream for 15h have about the same ability in adsorbing oxygen, but the catalyst that has been on stream for 48h can adsorb much less oxygen. Sintering of the CuCl and Pd in this catalyst should be responsible for such a difference to occur. The patterns of desorption of ethanol from CuCl–PdCl2/C catalysts are shown in Fig. 5 . The release of ethanol from the catalysts spans over a broad range of temperature, revealing the heterogeneous nature of the catalyst surface. Similar to Fig. 4, Fig. 5 also shows that a fresh catalyst and the catalyst that has been on stream for 15h have about the same ability in adsorbing oxygen, and such ability is far greater than the ability of the catalyst that has been on stream for 48h. The patterns of desorption of carbon monoxide from fresh CuCl/C and CuCl–PdCl2/C catalysts as well as those from two spent CuCl–PdCl2/C catalysts are shown in Fig. 6 . Astonishing differences among the catalysts in the strength and the amount of adsorption of carbon monoxide were observed. A fresh CuCl–PdCl2/C catalyst and the catalyst that has been on stream for 15h have similar peaks, showing that these catalysts can adsorb about the same amount of carbon monoxide and with about the same adsorption strength. Due to the sintering of CuCl and the loss of PdCl2, the CuCl–PdCl2/C catalyst that has been on stream for 48h can adsorb only little carbon monoxide, with a strength close to that of CuCl/C catalyst. In other words, the catalyst that has been on stream for 48h has become like a CuCl/C catalyst of low CuCl dispersion. Fig. 6 also reveals the importance of palladium chloride in a CuCl–PdCl2/C catalyst. The chloride can homogenize the surface for carbon monoxide adsorption and thus can lower the strength of adsorption. Carbon monoxide adsorbed on cuprous chloride forms CuCOCl [14–16]. The adsorption is considered to be one of the key steps in the synthesis of dimethyl carbonate [14]. 3.4 Catalyst activity and reaction steps The activity of CuCl–PdCl2/C catalyst for the oxidative carbonylation of ethanol is illustrated in Fig. 7 . An activation period is observed for the catalyst. In this period, the conversion of ethanol and the selectivity of diethyl carbonate both increase with the time the catalyst is on stream. The principle by-product in this period is acetaldehyde. The amount of by-product diminishes gradually with the time, and disappears completely after the catalyst is on stream for 5h. In other words, a 100% selectivity of diethyl carbonate may be achieved after the catalyst is on stream for 5h. Such high selectivity explains the usefulness of the catalyst in the production of diethyl carbonate. The alternation of selectivity with time in the first 5h reveals that the catalyst is under constant reconstruction during this period. The activity of the catalyst reaches a maximum in about 15h and then starts to drop (Fig. 7). The selectivity in the deactivation period remains the same, showing that the site properties are not altered. The decrease in catalyst activity is caused by a decrease in site number only. The activity of CuCl/C catalyst has also been examined for the oxidative carbonylation of ethanol under the same reaction conditions. The result shows that CuCl/C is not active for the reaction. This observation is quite different from that fund in the oxidative carbonylation of methanol. In the methanol case, both CuCl/C and CuCl–PdCl2/C are active. Since a major difference between CuCl–PdCl2/C and CuCl/C catalysts is their ability to adsorb carbon monoxide (Fig. 6), such ability may be the key factor to determine the activity of the catalyst. As shown in Fig. 6, the strength of adsorption of carbon monoxide on a CuCl–PdCl2/C catalyst is significantly lower than that on a CuCl/C catalyst. A weak adsorption of carbon monoxide may produce just the amount needed for the reaction to occur. In a slurry reaction system using a cuprous chloride catalyst, Romano et al. [14] have shown that the oxidative carbonylation of methanol can be separated into two separate steps. The first step is the formation of cupric methoxychloride, (CH3O–Cu)+Cl−. The second step is to reduce the cupric methoxychloride with carbon monoxide to form DMC. King [17] has studied the same reaction over a zeolite supported copper catalyst, Cu(I)–Y. Based on the intermediates detected, the author separated the reaction into three steps. The first step is the oxidation of methanol and Cu(I) to form copper methoxide, (CH3O–Cu)+Y−. The second step involves the insertion of CO to the methoxide to form carbomethoxide, (CH3O–CO–Cu)+Y−. This is the rate-limiting step. The third step, or the final step, is the reaction of methanol and oxygen with the carbomethoxide to form dimethyl carbonate. Since ethanol has the same functional group as methanol, the oxidative carbonylation of ethanol may be separated in steps similar to that of methanol. Here we suggest that the oxidative carbonylation of ethanol over CuCl/C catalyst can be separated into three steps. The first step is to oxidize ethanol and CuCl to form copper ethoxide: (1) 2CuCl+2C2H5OH+ (1/2)O2 →2(C2H5O–Cu)+Cl− +H2O The second step is to insert carbon monoxide to the ethoxide. Since only CuCl–PdCl2/C is active for the oxidative carbonylation of ethanol and CuCl/C is not, the two catalysts will differ significantly in the strength of adsorption of carbon monoxide (Fig. 6). One may draw the conclusion that the insertion requires the carbon monoxide be adsorbed with a proper strength. This requirement controls the whole reaction. Hence we may assign the insertion as the rate-limiting step in the oxidative carbonylation of ethanol. The insertion produces carboethoxide and is expressed as follows: (2) (C2H5O–Cu)+Cl− +CO(ad)→(C2H5O–CO–Cu)+Cl− The final step in the oxidative carbonylation of ethanol is probably the reaction between the adsorbed (C2H5O–CO–Cu)+Cl− and (C2H5O–Cu)+Cl−: (3) (C2H5O–CO–Cu)+Cl− +(C2H5O–Cu)+Cl− →(C2H5O)2CO+2CuCl This step generates diethyl carbonate and then the catalyst returns to its initial state. The effects of the reaction temperature on the reaction are shown in Fig. 8 . The conversion of ethanol is, as expected, increased with the temperature. The selectivity of diethyl carbonate is 100% over a temperature range between 90 and 120°C. The high selectivity and wide temperature tolerance is advantageous in producing the product in industry. Increasing the reaction temperature above 120°C would result in a drop in the selectivity. Acetaldehyde is the main by-product at 130°C. A further increase in the temperature to above 140°C would generate excess carbon dioxide and water. The influence of the CO/O2 mole ratio in the feed on the synthesis is shown in Fig. 9 . The conversion of ethanol is decreased by an increase in the ratio. In other words, a higher concentration of oxygen is desirable to have a greater yield of diethyl carbonate. Another interesting thing to be noticed from Fig. 9 is the stability of the selectivity. The selectivity remains at 100% despite the changes in the conversion or the CO/O2 ratio. 4 Conclusions CuCl–PdCl2/C catalyst prepared by impregnation is active for the oxidative carbonylation of ethanol. The catalyst can achieve 100% selectivity for diethyl carbonate providing the reaction temperature is below 120°C. The rate-limiting step in the carbonylation is the insertion of carbon monoxide to ethoxy, C2H5O–CuCl. The catalyst is easily deactivated while on stream. The causes of the deactivation are the sintering of the cuprous chloride and the decomposition of the palladium chloride on the catalyst.
