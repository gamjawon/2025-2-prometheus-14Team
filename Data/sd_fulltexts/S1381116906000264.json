Graphical abstract The catalytic effects of synthesized Cu-Ni/VSO catalysts on the synthesis of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) from CO2 and CH3OH were investigated. DRIFT spectra of the catalyst showed that CO2 and CH3OH were activated effectively by the catalysts, as evidenced by the high DMC yield and selectivity of CH3OH. The catalytic effects of Cu-Ni/VSO catalysts on the synthesis of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) from CO2 and CH3OH were investigated. The Cu-Ni/VSO catalysts were fully characterized by infra-red spectra (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and diffuse reflectance FTIR (DRIFT) spectra. The crystalinity of the catalysts was influenced by process of reduction, and the crystal type of V2O5 on the surface of VSO changed when the catalysts were reduced. DRIFT spectra of catalyst showed that CO2 and CH3OH were activated effectively by the catalysts. Keywords Catalysis Carbon dioxide Dimethyl carbonate 1 Introduction Dimethyl carbonate (DMC) is an environmentally benign chemical product with a wide range of applications. DMC can serve as a non-toxic substitute for dimethyl sulfate and phosgene, which are highly toxic and corrosive methylation and carbonylating agents [1–3]. In addition, DMC is also a good solvent, a useful fuel additive and a monomer for the synthesis of polycarbonate resins [4,5]. One synthesis method of DMC requires phosgene as a reagent. This is highly undesired due to the extreme toxic nature of phosgene. Another route to the preparation of DMC is the oxidative carbonylation of CH3OH with CO and oxygen [6,7]. However, both copper and palladium catalysts are required for this synthesis. The use of expensive metal catalysts makes such process unfavorable especially when the industrial scale preparation is concerned. In recent years, direct synthesis of DMC from CO2 and CH3OH became an attractive approach [8]. The low-cost of CO2 is an apparent advantage. Moreover, the process of converting “waste” CO2 into a versatile chemical product is regarded as a highly “green” chemical process [9]. Organometallic compounds such as BuSn(OMe)2 [10,11], metal (□) tetra-alkoxide [12], magnesium dialkoxide [13], potassium carbonate [14], zirconia [15], CeO2–ZrO2 [16] and Ni(CH3COO)2 [9] have been employed as catalysts for the synthesis of DMC from CO2 and methanol. However, due to the limit of reaction thermodynamics, the activities of these catalytic systems were quite low even in the presence of dehydrating agents and additives. Recently, it was reported that a direct synthesis of DMC from CO2 and CH3OH could be carried out at the supercritical conditions [17,18]. Dehydrate agents, such as CaCl2 [19], 2.2-dimethoxy propane (DMP) [16] acetals [9,20] and molecular sieves [21] were added to reaction system to remove water to facilitate the conversion of CO2 and CH3OH. However, the reaction conditions were difficult to control. Now gaseous reaction can be adopted for the direct synthesis of DMC from CO2 and methanol. The reaction can be carried out in a fixed bed reactor, and there is no water in the reaction system during reaction that favors the progress of the formation of DMC. Therefore, we report an efficient direct synthesis of DMC from gaseous methanol and CO2, using a supported Cu-Ni/VSO heterogeneous catalyst due to their economy nature of both Cu and Ni. The Cu-Ni/VSO has been reported for the synthesis of DMC from methanol and CO2; however, the authors had not discussed the preparation of the catalyst in details [22,23]. Therefore, the catalysts are characterized in new ways to disclose the reaction process of CH3OH and CO2 on it and the effect of reduction conditions of catalysts for the synthesis of DMC from CH3OH and CO2 have been researched. 2 Experimental methods 2.1 Catalyst preparation Preparation of VSO (V2O5–SiO2): V2O5 was reacted with HCl (38% wt.%) at 363K to produce VOCl3; SiO2 was introduced into VOCl3 solution to form a mixture which was aged for 24h, and then surface reaction was proceeded on SiO2 at 363K for 24h. NH4OH was introduced into the reaction system to neutralize excessive acid at room temperature. Finally, VSO was filtered, dried at 393K for 12h and calcined at 723K in the air for 5h. Preparation of Cu-Ni/VSO: VSO was soaked in a solution of copper and nickel ammonia for 48h, and then dried at 393K in the air for 12h and calcined at 723K in the air for 5h. 2.2 Catalyst characterization FTIR and DRIFT spectra were recorded on an EQUINOX 55 (Bruker Co. Fourier transformation infra-red spectrometer coupled with infra-red microscope). XRD patterns were measured with D/Max-IIIA (Powder X-ray Diffract meter). Pre-reduction for DRIFT spectra was performed by reducing the sample in a pure H2 flow (5K/min) at 0.2MPa from 298 to 473K, and held at this temperature for 30min, then a mixture of CH3OH/CO2 was introduced at 473K and kept for 30min, pressure was maintained at 0.2MPa. When temperature decreased to room temperature, DRIFT spectra were collected as soon as possible. 2.3 Synthesis of DMC from CO2 and CH3OH A continuous tubular fixed-bed micro-gaseous reactor (15mm i.d.) was used for the assessment of synthesized catalysts. A representative procedure is as follows: 0.5g of catalyst was placed on the fiberglass stuffed in the reactor; CO2 and CH3OH were purged into the reactor at the same time. CH3OH was introduced into the reactor using CO2 flow. A 2:1 ratio of CH3OH and CO2 was kept during the reaction, which was controlled via vaporization temperature of CH3OH and the flux of CO2. Amounts of CH3OH and CO2 were controlled by gas-flow meter. CH3OH/CO2 =500/250mmol was kept for each test. The reaction was carried out at different temperatures (373–453K) and different pressures (0.2–0.9MPa). Products were absorbed in deionized water and analyzed by gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). 3 Result and discussion 3.1 Catalyst characterization FTIR spectra of SiO2 (a), V2O5 (b), VSO (c), CuO-NiO/VSO (d) and Cu-Ni/VSO (e) are shown in Fig. 1 . Compared with FTIR spectra of SiO2 and V2O5, FTIR spectra of VSO (c) has a new band at 964cm−1. This band can be assigned to the stretching of VOSi bond. Spectrum (b) has a band at 1021cm−1 and stretching of VO bond at 824cm−1, the former disappears and VO stretching band shifts to 816cm−1 in spectrum (c). Moreover, the bands of 598 and 469cm−1 in spectrum (b) shifts to 558 and 464cm−1, which are related to the vibration of VO bond. These spectra data clearly show that there is no dissociated V2O5 on the surface of VSO. The FTIR spectrum of CuO-NiO/VSO (d) showing the band of 964cm−1 , corresponding to the stretching of VOSi in spectrum (c), shifts to 943cm−1, indicating the change of chemical environment around VOSi. In addition, three new bands at 826, 887 and 648cm−1 are observed, corresponding to the presence of CuO and NiO on the surface of VSO. FTIR spectra of Cu-Ni/VSO seem similar to that of SiO2 due to the disappearance of bands at 826, 887 and 648cm−1 and the band at 943cm−1 that was overlapped by the broad band at 1097cm−1. Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of SiO2 (a), V2O5 (b), VSO (c) and Cu-Ni/VSO (d). XRD of (a) shows that SiO2 is amorphous. Based on the XRD of V2O5, it is mainly rhombic crystal. The crystal of V2O5 was on the surface of VSO, and it exists as micro-crystal structure. On the XRD of Cu-Ni/VSO (d) in Fig. 2, two new diffraction peaks at 2θ =43 and 50° appeared. This is assigned to the diffraction of Cu–Ni alloy with 20% Ni and 80% Cu. The peaks of 001, 101, 110, 211 and 012 disappeared, while the peak of 111 became a main peak. Three new peaks at 2θ =24, 36 and 41° appeared on the XRD of Cu-Ni/VSO. Presumably, the crystal structure of V2O5 has changed greatly after the sample was reduced. This change can be observed on the FTIR spectra of (c) and (e). A new strong peak at 2θ =53° appeared on the XRD of Cu-Ni/VSO, which may result from the reaction of V2O5 and Cu–Ni alloy. The reducing conditions of CuO-NiO/VSO into Cu-Ni/VSO are summarized in Table 1 , and the XRD patterns of the reduced products are shown in Fig. 3 . Sample (b) was reduced in a mixture of 1:10 H2/N2, at a temperature profile from 373 to 793K with a gradient of 4K/min, and the ratio of H2/N2 was changed to 1:6 at temperature between 573 and 673K. For sample (c), the reduction of CuO-NiO/VSO was carried out under otherwise identical conditions as those of sample (b) except the temperature gradient was set at 8K/min. The reduction conditions of sample (d) were similar to those of sample (c), except that the temperature was held at 626K within 20min. XRD patterns indicate that the different reduction processes gave the same V2O5 crystals on the reduced catalysts, although they were different from V2O5 on surface of VSO (a). The crystalinity decreased in an order of sample (c)>(d)>(b) based on the examination of the ratios of intensity/FWHM of the above samples. The same is true for the crystalinity of Cu–Ni alloy. DRIFT spectra for the adsorption of CO2 and CH3OH on Cu-Ni/VSO are shown in Fig. 4 . As shown in Fig. 4(a), the absorption of CO2 and CH3OH on the catalyst led to the appearance of new bands at 937, 670, 593 and 571cm−1. These can be assigned to the stretching of horizontal adsorption CO2 on the surface of Cu-Ni/VSO catalyst. In the region of 2000–1300cm−1 in Fig. 4 (b), new bands at 1300, 1573 and 1554cm−1 associated with the vibration of bidentate carbonate on VO bond was observed. Two characteristic bands, located at 1983 and 1946cm−1, can be assigned to the linear type adsorption of CO2 on Ni and Cu, respectively. Peaks at 1588 and 1341cm−1 are characteristic bands of horizontal adsorption of CO2 on the surface of Cu–Ni alloy. The bands at 1603, 1537, 1472 and 1365cm−1 arisen after the adsorption of CO2 and CH3OH. These can be assigned to the formation of methyl carbonate-type species. The band at 1700cm−1 is related to bond of CO. The bands at 2817, 2895 and 3015cm−1 associated with CH stretching vibrations of monodentate and bidentate of methoxide groups were observed as shown in Fig. 4(c). Bands at 2352cm−1 corresponding to the molecular type adsorption CO2 were also observed in the same figure. In the region of 4000–3500cm−1 in Fig. 4(d), molecular adsorption of the methanol hydroxyl group at 3640cm−1 can be observed. Moreover, bands at 3680, 3689 and 3668cm−1 were also observed, due to the vibration of VOH bond resulted from the interaction of VO and H of CH3OH. Multi-peak bands in the same region showed the presence of several types of hydroxyl groups on the surface of Cu-Ni/VSO. The bands at 3768 and 3737cm−1 are owing to the presence of terminal, bi-bridged and tri-bridged hydroxyl groups, respectively. Such spectra clearly suggest that CO2 and CH3OH have been activated on the supported catalyst system. 3.2 Synthesis of DMC from CO2 and CH3OH Fig. 5 shows the temperature dependence of DMC synthesis on different catalytic systems. The yields of DMC increased with increasing temperature, while the increase of yields started slowing down at about 413K. This is due to that the higher temperature can lead to the decrease of carbon dioxide absorption on catalysts. Fig. 6 shows the selectivity of DMC base on CH3OH as a product at different temperatures. The major by-product is dimethoxyl methane (DMM) in this reaction. The selectivity decreased at higher temperatures in all the catalytic systems due to the decomposition of DMC. When temperature was higher than 413K, the selectivity decreased more dramatically, following an order of (b)>(c)≈(d). In summarizing, the optimal temperature for the synthesis of DMC synthesis using the supported catalysts is about 413K. Fig. 7 shows the pressure dependence of the yield and selectivity of DMC base on CH3OH with Cu-Ni/VSO (c) as the catalyst. Both the yield and selectivity of DMC increased with increasing pressure. The increasing trend leveled off when the pressure reached to about 0.6MPa. 4 Conclusions Based on the experimental results, the following conclusive remarks can be obtained: (1) A new VOSi bond was formed when V2O5 was supported onto SiO2 as evidenced by the observation from the FTIR spectrum changes of VSO. (2) The crystal type of V2O5 remained unchanged on the surface of VSO, while it changed when CuO-NiO/VSO was reduced to Cu-Ni/VSO. (3) Based on the DRIFT spectra, methanol and CO2 were activated upon being adsorbed onto the catalyst. This is of crucial importance for this catalytic reaction. (4) The crystalinity of the catalysts showed a slight influence on the DMC synthesis, and a higher crystalinity resulted in a higher yield of DMC. (5) An increase in reaction temperature led to a higher conversion of CH3OH but a decrease in selectivity of DMC formation. The optimal conditions for both the high conversion of methanol and the good selectivity of DMC formation were the temperature of 413K and the pressure of 0.6MPa.
