Lithium-sulfur battery (Li–S) is considered as one of the new-generation rechargeable batteries with high performance because of its extremely high theoretical capacity, energy density, environmental harmony and low cost. However, low electrical and ionic conductivity of sulfur, safety concerns and parasitic reaction generated by the dissolved polysulfide species in electrolyte hinder the commercialization of Li–S battery. Herein, we report a polyhedral porous structure comprising of carbon coating metal selenide nanoparticles (CoSe2/C), which could not only host sulfur for Li-S battery owing to its porous and conductive structure, but also mitigate the shuttle phenomenon by polysulfides adsorption and catalytic acceleration of redox kinetics. As a result, a performance enhanced CoSe2/C-S electrode for Li-S battery is achieved.

Conventional LIBs, based on ion-insertion, are widely used in portable devices due to its advantages such as high output voltage, low self-discharge and long cycle life. After more than 20 years of development, the cathode materials of LIBs are almost reaching the limit of theoretical capacity. In addition, LIBs cannot be used in large-scale energy storage technology due to their low energy density. Compared with the LIBs, the theoretical capacity of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is 3–5 times higher [1]. Theoretically, S is expected to deliver a specific capacity of 1675 mAh g−1 and an energy density of 2600 Wh Kg−1 when is completely reduced to lithium sulfides (Li2S) [2]. Although advantageous features of sulfur such as abundant natural resources, low cost and nontoxicity make Li-S batteries more commercially competitive than LIBs, poor cyclic stability, low coulombic efficiency, alarming safety, and high self-discharge rate limit their commercialization [3]. These challenges are related to the low conductivity of sulfur, poor reaction kinetics and the dissolution of lithium polysulfide into the electrolyte (shuttle effect), which would lead polysulfides to react with the Li anode or randomly deposit on the anode surface. Therefore, many efforts have been exerted on cathodes [4–6], electrolytes [7,8], separators [9,10], and Li-metal anodes [11–13] to prevent the migration of polysulfides and enhance the utilization of sulfur. Non-polar carbon materials which are used to host sulfur can improve cathode conductivity and physically adsorb the polysulfides in general [14]. Nazar's research group first confined S within highly ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK-3), which exhibited high reversible capacity [15]. After this successful attempt, various carbon materials were further investigated for improving the cyclic performance of Li-S batteries, including porous carbon [16], microporous carbon [17,18], carbon nanotubes/fibers [19], graphene [20,21] and carbon composites [22], etc. However, owing to the weak intermolecular interactions, non-polar carbon is not effective to inhibit the shuttle phenomenon of polysulfides, particularly during the long-cycling process. Unlike non-polar carbon materials, metal-based compounds can trap polysulfides by Lewis acid–base interaction effectively [23–26]. And during early stage, researchers mainly focus on using the electrochemically inactive metal oxides, such as Al2O3 [27] and TiO2 [28], to trap the dissolved polysulfides in the cathode. However, in 2016, Cui and co-workers discovered that metal sulfides can not only form strong bonds with polysulfides to alleviate the shuttle phenomenon, but also can play an important role as an activation electrochemical catalyst to promote the oxidation of Li2S back to S during battery charging [29]. Since then, various metal sulfides, i.e., ZrS2 [30], VS2 [31] have been used to trap polysulfides and promote the conversion of oxidation of Li2S to S in Li-S batteries. Similar as metal sulfides, metal selenides are also a kind of Lewis acid–bases and also have good electrocatalytic activity. Additionally, the metal selenides as the half-metal owns good conductivity [32,33]. All these features suggest the metal selenides could be good candidates to enhance the performances of S cathode by mitigate the polysulfides shuttle effect by chemically adsorb the polysulfides and catalytic acceleration of redox kinetics. Recently, several creative studies were reported for the successful applications of metal selenides’ in Li-S batteries [34–37]. Besides, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with high surface area, diversity of metal centres and tuneable porosity [38], are good templates to synthesize the hollow/porous metal compounds and carbon composites [39]. Therefore, inspired by the discussions above, in this work, we use a MOF (ZIF-67) as the initial template, successfully synthesize a polyhedral porous structure comprising by metal selenide and carbon (CoSe2/C) as the sulfur host for Li-S battery. As shown in Scheme 1 , the hollow CoSe2/C nanostructures can provide enough space to load large amount of sulfur and buffer the volume changes during charge/discharge process; the Lewis CoSe2, on the one hand can trap polysulfides and reduce concentration of polysulfides in the electrolyte to mitigate the shuttle effect, on the other hand, this chemically adsorption can enhance redox kinetics of Li2S back to S conversion. As a result, the CoSe2/C-S composites exhibited enhanced cyclic stability, and delivered the initial discharge capacity as high as 658.2 mAh g−1 at 2 C and stabilized the discharge capacity to 380.8 mAh g−1 after 400 cycles. In addition, when cycled at current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 C, CoSe2/C-S composites electrode presented stable specific capacities of 1147.7, 830.8, 640.3, 540 and 457.6 mAh g−1, which is superior to the bare sulfur. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of ZIF-67 1.455 g Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 1.642 g 2-methyl imidazole were mixed and dissolved fully in 80 mL methanol solution. The solution stood at room temperature for 24 h. The ZIF-67 product was collected from the above solution by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 5 min and washed by ethanol for 3–5 times and finally dried in vacuum at 120 °C for 12 h. 2.2 Synthesis of CoSe2/C hollow nanocomposite The prepared ZIF-67 was mixed with selenium powder with a mass ratio of 1:2 followed by heating at 350 °C for 90 min. 2.3 Synthesis of CoSe2/C-S nanocomposites The CoSe2/C nano-composites were mixed with sulfur with a mass ratio of 3:7 and sealed in a glass tube. The tube was heated at 155 °C for 5 h. After cooling down, the product was collected for characterization. 2.4 Materials characterization The samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the morphology of the samples was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). N2 adsorption/desorption was conducted to determine the pore size distribution and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from 30 °C to 800 °C under nitrogen atmosphere to determine the mass content of sulfur. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was analyzed the samples surface chemistry of C 1s, Co 2p, Se 3d. The samples’ adsorption was measured utilizing ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectrometer. 2.5 Electrochemical characterization Electrochemical measurements were carried out at room temperature based on a coin-type half-cell. The electrode was prepared by mixing the active materials (CoSe2/C-S), super-P carbon and poly(vinylidenefluoride) (PVDF) binder with a mass ratio of 7:2:1 in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP). In comparison, bare S electrode (5:2:2:1, sulfur:graphite powder:super P:PVDF) has also been prepared. The obtained slurry was coated on an aluminum foil and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. The areal sulfur loading of the cathode is about 1 mg cm−2. The CR 2025 type coin cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box (H2O < 0.5 ppm, O2 < 0.5 ppm). Lithium foil was used as the anode, celgard 2400 as the separator, 1 M lithium (trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI) with 1,3-dioxolane (DOL):1,2-dimethyoxyethane (DME) (v/v= 1/1) containing lithium nitrate (LiNO3) (2 wt%) was used as the electrolyte. The amount of electrolyte used in each cell was about 60 µL. Cells were activated at 0.1 C before cycling (1 C=1675 mA g−1). The capacity of each cell was calculated based on mass of the sulfur. Galvanostatic charge/discharge performances were tested between 1.8 and 2.8 V (vs. Li/Li+) by using testing system of Land battery station (Land CT 2001A). Electrochemical impedance spectrums (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were obtained on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E). The kinetic evaluation of polysulfide conversion was carried out by testing the assembled symmetric cells, which the corresponding electrodes were fabricated by CoSe2/C-S nanocomposites and PVDF with a mass ratio of 4:1 in NMP; the obtained slurry was coated on an aluminum foil and dried at 60 °C for 12 h; the symmetric cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box (H2O < 0.5 ppm, O2 < 0.5 ppm); two identical electrodes were used as the cathode and anode, celgard 2400 as the separator, 1 M LiTFSI with DME:DOL (v/v= 1/1) containing LiNO3 (2 wt%) and Li2S6 solution mixed with the volume ratio of 1:2 as the electrolyte; the amount of electrolyte used in each cell was about 60 µL. The CV measurement of the symmetric cell was conducted at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 with a voltage window between −0.8 and 0.8 V. EIS curves were tested at open circuit potential with a scanning frequency range from 10 mHz to 100 kHz. 2.6 Computational validation The adsorption properties of the Li2S6 on CoSe2 have been studied by the first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT), as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP). The exchange and correlation functional used the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) expressed by Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional, the ion-electron interactions were determined by the projector augmented wave (PAW) method. To avoid the interactions between the neighboring periodic slabs, the vacuum distance between CoSe2 panels and their image is larger than 24 Å. The cell parameter was 100 atoms in total for CoSe2 (120) and (111) surface. A 5×5×1 grid for k-point sampling was employed; the plane-wave energy cutoff was set to 400 eV; and the convergence criterion of force was 0.01 eV/Å. 3 Results and discussion As revealed by the SEM and TEM images (Fig. 1 ), the as-prepared ZIF-67 particles exhibit rhombic dodecahedron morphology and a smooth surface. After selenization, the resulted CoSe2/C nanocomposites still keep the dodecahedron morphology as shown in Fig. 1(b, d), suggesting its good stability, but a rough and grainy surface appears compared with ZIF-67, indicating the successful selenization. Also, the SEM images of CoSe2/C-S nanocomposites reveal that the morphology of CoSe2/C is maintained after loading of sulfur (Fig. S1). Besides, the elemental mapping analysis demonstrates the coexistence and dispersion of C, Co, Se, and S elements in CoSe2/C-S composites, and the loading of S into CoSe2/C-S nanocomposites has nearly no influence on their hollow structure (Fig. 1g). To further explore the presence of CoSe2 and carbon layer, the CoSe2/C-S nanocomposites were characterized by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) (Fig. 1e). The HRTEM analysis shows the interplanar distance of 0.261 nm, which corresponds to (111) planes of CoSe2 nanocomposites, while the HRTEM image in Fig. 1(f) shows amorphous carbon layer existence. The XRD peaks of ZIF-67 in Fig. 2 (a) at the 2θ of 7.1°, 12.5°, 17.8° and 26.5°, are in good agreement with those of the simulated peaks of ZIF-67 (Fig. S2) [40]. The corresponding diffraction peaks of prepared CoSe2/C nanocomposites in Fig. 2(a) (orange line) could match with the standard CoSe2 (JPCDS no. 53-0449), suggesting the conversion of ZIF-67 to CoSe2 nanocomposites. After loaded with sulfur by heat-treatment, the characteristic CoSe2/C-S composites (red line) peaks in Fig. 2(b) confirm the existence of sulfur (JPCDS no. 08-0427), and the element mapping in Fig. 1(g) is also confirmed that the sulfur existence homogeneously in the pores and gap of CoSe2/C-S nanoparticles. The surface area of CoSe2/C nanocomposites is determined by BET method according to the N2 adsorption/desorption (Fig. 2c), which is to be 45.15 m2 g−1, while the pore sizes are ranged from 5 nm to 100 nm. The surface area of CoSe2/C-S nanocomposites greatly dropped to 2.1 m2 g−1 for the sulfur blocking in the porous structure. The mass ratio of CoSe2 and carbon is 55.87%: 44.13% as shown in Fig. S3. The mass loading of sulfur in the CoSe2/C-S nanocomposites is as high as 70 wt% determined by TGA, which offers high gravimetric energy densities of the electrode material for Li-S batteries in Fig. 2(d). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of CoSe2/C-S nanocomposites and the corresponding C 1s, Co 2p, Se 3d XPS spectra are shown in Fig. 3 . As shown in Fig. 3(a), the whole XPS spectrum clearly indicate the presence of C, Co, Se. While as shown in Fig. 3(b), the C 1s spectrum demonstrates the peaks arising from C−C, C−O, C=O at 284.8, 285.8 and 288.3 eV, respectively and C−C is the major peak, illustrating the carbonization of the organic linkers and good conductivity. Two outstanding peaks in Fig. 3(c) corresponding to Co 2p 3/2 (778.3 eV) and Co 2p 1/2 (793.5 eV) observed from the Co 2p XPS spectrum, could prove the oxidation state of Co [41]. In Se 3d XPS spectrum (Fig. 3d), Se displays two peaks at 54.3 and 55.6 eV may come from the Se–Co bonds. In addition, the appearance of additional two peaks at high binding energies of 58.2 and 59.5 eV coincide with Se−O bonds [42]. To investigate the electrochemical process, CV was conducted as shown in Fig. 4(a). At a sweep rate of 0.1 mV s−1, the CV curves of the CoSe2/C-S composites electrode are similar to those of the bare sulfur electrode. In cathodic scan, two sharp peaks located at 2.32 and 2.05 V are related to the high-order polysulfides transformed from S8 and the insoluble Li2S2/Li2S converted from the high-order polysulfides, respectively. In contrast, in the anodic scan, the oxidation peaks are observed at about 2.27 and 2.38 V, which should be attributed to the conversion insoluble of Li2S to high order polysulfides and even to sulfur [43]. Meanwhile, that the lower oxidation and higher reduction reaction platforms of CoSe2/C-S composites cathode than those of the bare sulfur cathode presents narrowed potential gaps, which illustrates the low potential polarization of CoSe2/C-S composites cathode [44]. The EIS of bare sulfur and CoSe2/C-S electrode is performed in Fig. S4, which verifies the low charge transfer resistance of CoSe2/C-S electrode at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces. In Fig. 4(b), the discharge plateaus of CoSe2/C-S composites and bare sulfur cathode at 0.5 C are then compared. As can be seen, both CoSe2/C-S composites and bare sulfur cathode showed two typical discharge voltages plateaus. The upper plateau at 2.32 V corresponds to the reduction of sulfur to a series of intermediate long-chain lithium polysulfides such as Li2S8 and Li2S6 to Li2S4, whereas the lower plateau at 2.05 V represents the reduction of short-chain lithium polysulfides to insoluble Li2S2 or Li2S. The potential polarization of bare sulfur electrode is larger than that of the CoSe2/C-S composites (Fig. S5), which is consistent with the CV curves. Then the cycling performances of CoSe2/C-S composites cathode and bare sulfur cathode at 0.5 C are illustrated in Fig. 4(c). After electrode activation, CoSe2/C-S composites cathode delivers an initial discharge capacity as high as 869.9 mAh g−1 which is superior to bare sulfur composites. After 200 cycles, the discharge capacity of CoSe2/C-S composites cathode keeps at 550.6 mAh g−1 with the capacity retention ratio reaching 66%, while the bare S cathode illustrate an extremely low reversible capacity of only 372.5 mAh g−1. The cycling results have indicated that by using the porous CoSe2/C-S host, the shuttle phenomenon of polysulfides have been effectively inhibited. Finally, the rate capabilities of CoSe2/C-S composites cathode and bare sulfur cathode are also investigated. As shown in Fig. 4(d), when cycled at current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 C, CoSe2/C-S composites cathode presents stable specific capacities of 1147.7, 830.8, 640.3, 540 and 457.6 mAh g−1, respectively, far higher than that of bare S cathode. As the current density returns to 0.2 C, its reversible capacity recovers to 701.8 mAh g−1 with a capacity retention ratio reaching 82%. The rate capability is commonly associated indicating the better stability and quicker reaction kinetics of CoSe2/C-S composites cathode than bare sulfur cathode. In order to clearly understand the mechanisms of improving the performance of CoSe2/C composites cathode, we conducted CV tests for the symmetric cells that used the CoSe2/C and Super P as the electrodes, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5 (a), The CoSe2/C nanocomposites exhibit a higher current density than that of Super P contrast sample, which indicates CoSe2 can promote the oxidation of Li2S back to high order polysulfides during battery charging. The quicker oxidation rate of Li2S will reduce the polarization and enhance the kinetics, and thus the CoSe2/C-S cathodes could exhibit small polarization voltage and high rate capability, which are in agreement with the results in Fig. 4(a, d). Tafel plots were obtained from Fig. S6 to identify the electrocatalytic effect on the charge-transfer kinetics during polysulfides conversion, as shown in Fig. 5(b). CoSe2/C-S electrode displays a lower Tafel slope (67 mV dec−1) compared to those of bare sulfur electrode (110 mV dec−1). The sharply decrease in the Tafel slope values of CoSe2/C-S confirms the acceleration of redox reaction of polysulfides. The exchange current densities are 0.62 and 0.45 mA cm−2 for the CoSe2/C-S and S electrodes, respectively, which are calculated from the Tafel curves, further illustrating a faster kinetics in CoSe2/C-S [45–47]. More importantly, to prove that the CoSe2 nanocomposites could suppress the polysulfide shuttle effect by interactions bond between polar intermediates and cooperative interfaces, simple adsorption experiments were conducted. In detail, 60 µL 0.1 M Li2S6/DME solution was added into 2.5 mL DME solutions and then mixed with 40 mg CoSe2/C nanocomposites. It is found that the solution added CoSe2/C turns into a clear state in the inset of Fig. 5(c), while the pure Li2S6 solutions and with the adding of super P remains to be yellow. Meanwhile we have used UV-vis spectrometer to determine the absorbance of these three solutions, show that the one added CoSe2/C nanocomposite cannot detect the characterized peak of polysulfide, suggesting the well entrapment of lithium polysulfide within CoSe2/C nanocomposites. What’s more, the chemical adsorption on polysulfides by (111) and (120) planes of CoSe2 is further investigated by density functional theory calculations between CoSe2 nanocomposites and Li2S6 as illustrated in Fig. 5(d). The binding energy (E b) is defined by E b = E CoSe 2 + E Li 2 S 6 − E total . The calculated binding energy is 2.73 and 3.11 eV for (120) and (111) planes respectively, which is important for trapping polysulfides and preventing them from dissolving into the electrolyte, thus improving the cycling performance of battery [44,48]. Due to the combination of these advantages of CoSe2/C nanostructures, the CoSe2/C-S composites were determined to be the promising cathodes for long-cycle life Li-S batteries even at high current densities. Thus, a long cycling performance of CoSe2/C-S upper to 700 cycles at 2 C is demonstrated in Fig. 6 . After two cycles activation at 0.1 C, CoSe2/C-S composites cathode could deliver a discharge capacity as high as 658.2 mAh g−1, and after 700 cycles, a reversible discharge capacity still could maintain at 363 mAh g−1 with a capacity decay of only 0.064%. The performance is among the first class of recent reported works (Tab. S1) [35,50–54]. Even if the sulfur loading of the electrode is as high as 2.305 mg cm−2, the CoSe2/C-S composites still can deliver 1.582 mAh cm−2 at 0.1 C (Fig. S7), indicating it is a promising host material toward practical application of Li-S battery. Such an excellent cycling performances at high current density is not only attributed to the adsorption of CoSe2 nanocomposites, but also the enhancing redox kinetics. Besides, the intrinsic high conductivity of metal selenide in the CoSe2/C-S composites is conducive to the delivery of better performance during long-term cycling with high current. 4 Conclusions In summary, we have successfully synthesized a polyhedral porous CoSe2/C nanocomposite and applied it as sulfur host for advanced Li-S batteries. The porous space could accommodate the volume expansion of the sulfur during discharge, while the conductive and electrochemical catalytic-active metal selenide could improve redox reaction kinetics in Li-S batteries. More importantly, the CoSe2 as the Lewis acid could provide strong binding function on the polysulfides to inhibit the migrating. Due to these favorable properties, the CoSe2/C-S composites electrode delivers enhanced cyclic and rate performances, i.e., 363 mAh g− 1 at 2 C after 700 cycles. Accordingly, polar, porous, electrochemical catalytic-active and high conductive nanomaterials could be good hosts for sulfur cathode and will bestow high-performance Li-S batteries.

        "dc:description": "Lithium-sulfur battery (Li–S) is considered as one of the new-generation rechargeable batteries with high performance because of its extremely high theoretical capacity, energy density, environmental harmony and low cost. However, low electrical and ionic conductivity of sulfur, safety concerns and parasitic reaction generated by the dissolved polysulfide species in electrolyte hinder the commercialization of Li–S battery. Herein, we report a polyhedral porous structure comprising of carbon coating metal selenide nanoparticles (CoSe2/C), which could not only host sulfur for Li-S battery owing to its porous and conductive structure, but also mitigate the shuttle phenomenon by polysulfides adsorption and catalytic acceleration of redox kinetics. As a result, a performance enhanced CoSe2/C-S electrode for Li-S battery is achieved.",
