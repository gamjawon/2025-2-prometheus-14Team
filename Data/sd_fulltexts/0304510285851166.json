(Received September 13,1984; accepted November 22,1984) Summary Cationic palladium complexes such as [Pd(dppe)(py)2][BF4]2, dppe = PhaPCHaCHaPPh;, are active catalysts for the telomerization of isoprene with diethylamine to give under mild conditions Jv\",N-diethyl(dimethyl-2,7- octadienyl)amines. In contrast to neutral palladium complexes, which favour tail-to-tail coupling of the isoprene units, the head-to-head and tail-to-head linkage prevails with these systems. Experiments with Tv-deuteriodiethyl- amine revealed that the hydrogen of the nucleophile adds selectively to C-6 of the octadienyl chain, as has been observed earlier for conventional palladium catalysts. Introduction The dimerization as well as telomerization of isoprene by use of nickel or palladium catalysts is an attractive route for the synthesis of Cic-terpenes. Unfortunately, selective head-to-tail coupling of the isoprene units, as is observed nearly exclusively in natural terpene compounds, has not been achieved so far. For instance, palladium/phosphine catalysts give in most cases selectively tail-to-tail products in both dimerization and telomerization reactions, and only few exceptions are known [1]. Neilan et al. have reported the reductive dimerization of isoprene in the presence of excess formic acid giving head-to-tail (or tail-to-head) terpene hydrocarbons [2]. Cationic palladium complexes such as [Pd(T?3- methallyl)(cod)]PF6 dimerize isoprene in the presence of tributylphosphine with ca. 90% selectivity to give the tail-to-head product 2,6-dimethyl-l,3,6- octatriene, and a cationic hydridopalladiumphosphine species was proposed as the intermediate [3]. * Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-6102/85/$3.30 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 336 In telomerization reactions of isoprene the selectivity can be shifted towards the head-to-tail products by use of acids [4], alcohols or water [5 - 7] as the nucleophile, and the head-to-head telomer has been observed with acetic acid [4] and phenol [8] as the nucleophile. We have reported recently on the telomerization of secondary amines with isoprene to give almost exclusively the tail-to-tail products [9]. By addition of catalytic amounts of acids such as CO; [10, II], acetic acid or BF3'OEt2 [12] the regioselectivity of the reaction changes drastically; depending on the type and amount of acid used the formation of head-to-tail, tail-to-head and even head-to-head isomers is favoured. Thus, with the catalyst Pd(acac)2/ P(C6Hn)3/BF3'OEt2 isoprene and diethylamine give the head-to-head isomer in up to 80% selectivity [12]. This strong impact on the product distribution was explained by the assumption of cationic palladium intermediates which may form via protona- tion of neutral species. In order to substantiate this assumption, we have studied the catalytic properties of well-characterized cationic palladium com- plexes such as [Pd(dppe)(dmso)2][C104]2 [13] or [Pd(l73-C3H7)(cod)]BF4 [14] in the reaction of diethylamine and isoprene. Similar complexes have been shown by Green and Munakata to be active for the telomerization of e.g. butadiene with methanol [15]. Experimental 'H and \"C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian EM 390 instrument at 90 MHz and on a Bruker CXP 200 instrument at 50.3 MHz, respectively. Chemical shifts were reported as 5-values relative to tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. The GC analyses were carried out on a Carlo Erba 2300 instrument using a 50 m OV-1 fused silica capillary column (0.25 mm i.d.) at 100 - 290 C; quantitative determinations were made with a Spectra Physics SP 4000 integrator. Mass spectra were obtained on a Varian MAT 112 S GC/MS system. All reactions were carried out under argon. Isoprene, solvents, ligands, complex salts and acidic cocatalysts were purified and stored under argon. Diethylamine was distilled over KOH pellets and kept under argon. JV-Deuteriodiethylamine was prepared from diethylamine and butyl lithium, followed by D^O (99.75% D) hydrolysis [16]. The palladium complexes Pd(acac)2, Pd(PhCN)2Cl2 [17], Pd(dppe)Cl2 [13], [Pd(dppe)- (py)2l[BF4]2 [18], [Pd(dppe)(dmso)2][C104]2 [13], [Pd(acac)(PPh3)2]- BF4 [19], lPd(T?3-C3H5)(cod)]BF4 [14], [Pd(Hcod)(cod)]BF4 [20], [Pd(acac)(cod)]BF4 [21] and [Pd(py)4][PF6l2 [22] were prepared ac- cording to literature methods. Catalytic runs The general procedure used was the same as that described in [12]. Experiments at 70 C were carried out in a 80 ml stainless steel autoclave, those at 25 C in a Schlenk tube. Clear yellow solutions were obtained from 337 the palladium complexes upon dissolving in acetonitrile followed by addition of isoprene and diethylamine. After the catalytic reactions, some Pd black as a decomposition product was observed, especially when a reaction tempera- ture of 70 C was used. In all cases where the isoprene conversion exceeded 50%, two liquid phases were observed. Quantitative product determination of 1 - 7 was carried out by GC. Synthesis of 8 A solution of 0.1 mmol [Pd(dppe)(py)2][BF4]2 in 12.5 ml CHsCN, 100 mmol of isoprene and 50 mmol of JV-deuteriodiethylamine (containing 20 wt.% of EtzO) was stirred at 25 C for 100 h. Solvent and unreacted educts were separated by evaporation at reduced pressure to give 9.13 g of a raw product containing 50.2% of 8 (GC analysis). The products were separated from the catalyst by distillation at 7 mm Hg and were further frac- tionated (Spaltrohr-System MSM 202 Fischer Labor- und Verfahrenstechnik). The deuterated amine 8 was isolated at 100.0 C/7.2 mmHg with a purity of 94% (GC analysis).

Results and discussion Cationic bis(solvento)palladium(II) complexes have recently been re- ported to have an unusually high ability to activate organic substrates. Thus, the hydrogenation of olefins is catalyzed at 30 C under 1 atm pressure of hydrogen [23]. Complexes of this type, such as [Pd(dppe)(py)2][BF4]2 and [Pd(dppe)(dmso)2][C104]2, also catalyze the reaction of isoprene and di- ethylamine to give the 1:1 adducts 1 - 3 and the telomers 4 - 7 (eqn. 1).

Especially at low temperatures (25 C) these com- plexes show significantly higher activity for this reaction than do in situ catalysts formed from e.g. Pd(acac)2/ligand and optionally an acidic cocatalyst [9,12]. Besides catalytic activity, the product selectivity within the telomers 4 - 7 is also noteworthy. The tail-to-head (4) and the head-to-head (5) isomers are the favoured products with a combined selectivity of 70% (70 C) and. 80% (25 C). This parallels the product distribution observed with in situ catalysts in the presence of acidic cocatalysts (run 6) [12], and is in contrast to the conventional catalysts such as Pd(acac)2/ligand which give selectively the tail-to-tail isomer 6 [9]. As is expected, the catalytic proper- ties of [Pd(dppe)(dmso)2][C104]2 and [Pd(dppe)(py)2][BF4]2 are rather similar and the nature of the non-coordinating anion and of the weak donor ligands (dimethyl sulfoxide and pyridine) is of no great influence. With [Pd(acac)(Ph3P)2]BF4 the yields of the tail-to-tail and head-to-tail isomers 6 and 7 are increased at the cost of the head-to-head isomer 5. This is likely to be due to ligand properties, since a similar effect was observed earlier with in situ catalysts (cf. run 6), if dppe is replaced by Ph^P [12]. In order to distinguish the effect of phosphine ligands from the cata- lytic properties of cationic palladium compounds, a series of non-phosphine- coordinated complexes was examined. As shown in Table 2, the head-to- head isomer 5 is in all cases the main product, with selectivities of up to 70%. Within the group of cyclooctadienyl complexes of the type PdL(cod)\"1\" with L = T^-allyl (run 7), cyclooctenyl (run 10) and 2,4-pentanedionate (run 12), isoprene conversions to 1 - 7 at a reaction temperature of 70 C are in the range of 23 - 46% with the allyl complex being the most active. Both the allyl and the cyclooctenyl complexes yield the head-to-head amine in a 339 TABLE 2 Non-phosphine-coordinated palladium complexes as catalysts for isoprene telomerization with diethylamine8 Run Catalyst Isoprene Selectivity Conversion (mol%)1' tol -7 1-34 567 7 [Pd(T^3-C3H5)(cod)]BF4 46 8 [Pd(7^3 C3H5)(cod)]BF4c 15 9 [Pd(7^3-C3H5)(cod)]BF4d 11 10 [Pd(Hcod)(cod)]BF4 23 11 [Pd(Hcod)(cod)]BF4c 4 12 [Pd(acac)(cod)]BP4 27 13 [Pd(py)4](PF6), 6 3 18 61 6 12 6 13 69 4 9 6 18 62 4 10 1 16 62 7 14 3 13 71 4 9 13 25 45 7 10 1 21 55 9 14 a Conditions: See Table 1. b Based on isoprene. c Addition of 5.0 mmol of HBF4. d Reaction temperature 25 C. selectivity of about 60%, which is further enhanced to 70% upon addition of catalytic amounts of HBF4 (runs 8 and 11). Reduction of reaction tempera- ture to 25 C does not alter the product distribution, but reduces isoprene conversion to 1 - 7 from 46% to 11% (run 9). Use of [Pd(py)4]2'1' as the catalyst gives rise to a reduced isoprene conversion of 6% (run 13). This may be explained by assuming easier displacement of olefin ligands (cod, T^-allyl, cyclooctenyl) than of pyridine ligands by the substrates. In conclusion, non- phosphine-coordinated cationic palladium complexes rather cleanly catalyze the formation of the head-to-head amine 5 with a selectivity of 60 - 70 mol%, but are less active than the phosphine-coordinated cationic complexes shown in Table 1. The reduced activity can be correlated to partial decompo- sition of the cationic complexes, since in all experiments of Table 2, and especially if HBF4 is added, the deposition of palladium black is observed. Upon addition of equimolar amounts of phosphorus ligands to [Pd(T?3- C3Hs)(cod)]BF4, palladium black formation is no longer observed in cata- lytic experiments and product yields are enhanced significantly (cf. Table 3). Isoprene conversion to 1 - 7 is in the range of 60 - 85%, which compares with 46% obtained in the absence of ligands (run 7). The properties of the indi- vidual ligands affect isoprene conversion to a minor extent, but rather control product selectivity. Thus, ligands of a high or medium basicity (SXi values according to Tolman [24] < 13 cm\"1) give amines 4 and 5 in a com- bined selectivity of 60 - 70%, whereas P(OPh)3 as a ligand of weak basicity yields the amines 6 and 7 in a combined yield of 65%. The head-to-head amine 5 is obtained as the main product with highly basic ligands such as PCy3 or PlPr3, especially if the reaction temperature is lowered from 70 C 340 TABLE 3 Effect of phosphorus ligands on isoprene telomerization catalyzed by the cationic palladium complex [Pd(??3-C3H5)(cod)]BF4a Run Ligand Sx^ Isoprene Selectivity (cm~1) Conversion (mol%)c tol -7 1-34 567 14 PCys'1 0.3 86 15 PCys 0.3 68 16 P'Pra'1 3.1 84 17 P'Pra 3.1 69 18 P\"Bu3 4.2 80 19 PPha 12.8 62 20 P(OPh)3 29.1 87 1 38 49 6 6 16 25 32 12 15 1 39 52 5 4 10 31 35 11 13 3 36 33 12 16 3 40 31 11 15 1 29 5 27 38 a Conditions: see Table 1; 0.5 mmol of ligand. b Ligand basicity according to Tolman [24].

Interestingly, this results not only in an increased selectivity to 5 of ~ 50% (combined selectivity of 4 and 5 ~ 90%), but also in an enhanced product yield. An effect of phosphorus ligands similar to that observed here with cationic palladium complexes was observed earlier with the catalyst system Pd(acac)2/ligand/BF3-OEt2 [12]. This can be taken as a further indication that cationic palladium intermediates play a significant role in the case of the latter catalyst system also. Both nickel and palladium catalysts have been reported to add the hydrogen of the nucleophile to C-6 of the octadienyl chain [16, 25]. Since cationic palladium(II) complexes give rise to a change in regioselectivity, it seemed of interest to establish the mode of hydrogen addition in these systems experimentally by use of JV-deuterated diethylamine. The reaction was carried out at room temperature with [Pd(dppe)(py)2][BF4]2 as the catalyst. Isoprene conversion was almost quantitative and the tail-to-head ispmer 8, which was formed in 50% selectivity, could be isolated by repeated distillation (eqn. 2). 2 ^ .

This is evident from the observed multiplicity and integration of proton signals and from the \"C-D coupling observed for Cg. 341 Based on these results, the sequence given below might be envisioned for the formation of the active species starting from cationic palladium(II) complexes: [PdlHcodHcodI]* *L.->S -2 cod [PdlHKLKSl^l* , _1 [PdlDIS);]2* *Et2NH -EtN=CHCH3 -H\\-S Scheme 1. L = PRa, HNEta; S = solvent. In the presence of ligand (PRa, HNEt;) and a weak donor (solvent, e.g. CH3CN), olefin elimination from e.g. a cyclooctenyl precursor yields a palladium hydride 9. This can also be formed from a cationic bis(solvento)- palladium complex via dehydrogenation of the reactant diethylamine. As an example for ligand oxidation in the coordination sphere of a cationic Pd(II) complex, the following catalytic reaction can be cited, which is equivalent to the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde followed by hydrosilanation [23,26]: [Pd^MeOH^dppe^/MeOH PhaSiH > PhaSiOCHa+H; (3) The cationic Pd(II) hydride 9 can act as the active species, which coor- dinates two isoprenes to give the bis(diene) complex 10. Rearrangement of this species under attack of the hydride at C-6 leads to the r^-allyl complex 11. A nickel analogue of 11 has been proposed recently as an intermediate by Akermark et al. [15]. Attack of diethylamine leads to product formation under regeneration of the hydride 9. The regioselectivity of the process depends on the pre-orientation of the isoprene units in 10, which should be affected by the electron density at palladium which in turn is influenced by the positive charge of the complex and the ligand basicity. The orientation of the isoprene ligands in hydride 10 may also be due to a reversible transformation into a ^-(l^-dimethy^allyl [12]. The fluxional behaviour of [Ir(H)(PPh3)2(773-2,3-dimethylbutenyl)]+ with a diene-dihydride intermediate can serve as a model for such a process [27]. If such an equilibration is operative, it should not involve hydrogen scrambling, since upon use of cationic palladium complexes the clean addition of the hydrogen of the nucleophile to Cf, of the octadienyl chain has also been established. As is evident from our experimental results, the hydride in 10 preferen- tially attacks the methyl-substituted double bond of isoprene, leading to the formation of the telomers 4 and 5. In contrast, with conventional palladium catalysts the hydrogen of the nucleophile is added to the unsubstituted double bond of isoprene, leading to isomers 6 and 7. 342 r-^ Pd-L ~7^\" H 11 (4) In summary, our results provide additional support to the assumption that charged palladium intermediates stabilized by large anions are respon- sible for the changed regioselectivity of isoprene telomerization with pre- formed catalysts such as cationic palladium(II) complexes, e.g. [Pd(T?3- C3Hs)(cod)]BF4,or in situ catalysts such as Pd(acac)2/PCy3/BF3-OEt2. On this basis, a more systematic approach to achieve better regioselectivity in these reactions seems viable. Acknowledgements The authors are grateful to Prof. W.

As is evident from our experimental results, the hydride in 10 preferen- tially attacks the methyl-substituted double bond of isoprene, leading to the formation of the telomers 4 and 5. In contrast, with conventional palladium catalysts the hydrogen of the nucleophile is added to the unsubstituted double bond of isoprene, leading to isomers 6 and 7. 342 r-^ Pd-L ~7^\" H 11 (4) In summary, our results provide additional support to the assumption that charged palladium intermediates stabilized by large anions are respon- sible for the changed regioselectivity of isoprene telomerization with pre- formed catalysts such as cationic palladium(II) complexes, e.g. [Pd(T?3- C3Hs)(cod)]BF4,or in situ catalysts such as Pd(acac)2/PCy3/BF3-OEt2. On this basis, a more systematic approach to achieve better regioselectivity in these reactions seems viable. Acknowledgements The authors are grateful to Prof. W.

Cationic palladium complexes such as [Pd(dppe)(py)2][BF4]2, dppe = Ph2PCH2CH2PPh2, are active catalysts for the telomerization of isoprene with diethylamine to give under mild conditions N,N-diethyl(dimethyl-2,7-octadienyl) amines. In contrast to neutral palladium complexes, which favour tail-to-tail coupling of the isoprene units, the head-to-head and tail-to-head linkage prevails with these systems. Experiments with N-deuteriodiethyl-amine revealed that the hydrogen of the nucleophile adds selectively to C-6 of the octadienyl chain, as has been observed earlier for conventional palladium catalysts References 1 W.
