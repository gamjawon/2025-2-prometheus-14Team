(+33)78022265, fax. (+33)78027187 Abstract Propene polymerization experiments have been carried out in the temperature range 50-95 C using stereospecific M902 supported Ziegler-Natta catalysts. Even in the absence of hydrogen, the terminal double bonds expected from the classical ss-elimination mechanism cannot be observed in the FT-IR spectra of the polymers, which are fully saturated. At high temperature, the residual stable activity is proportional to the alkylaluminium concentration. Reactivation of partially deactivated catalysts is possible upon addition of hydrogen: the greatest effect is observed for the highest temperature. A deactivation mechanism is proposed which produces a saturated polymer and a n-allyl titanium species. Mechanisms for the reactivation of this species by alkylaluminium or hydrogen are also proposed. They are discussed and compared with other activation mechanisms suggested in the literature for both heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis. Key words: deactivation; propene polymerization; reactivation; Ziegler-Natta catalyst Introduction The mechanism involved in the termination of the chain growth in olefin polymerization with Ziegler-Natta catalysts has been thoroughly studied in the first decade of the Ziegler-Natta catalyst era. These main mechanisms are transfers onto alkylaluminium, monomer and hydrogen, and also spontaneous ss-elimination, which leads to a metal hydride and an unsaturated chain end. It is generally accepted that these mechanisms are valid for the last generation of MgC12-supported catalysts, as well as for the first generation which did not use supports. However, that generalization is not obvious: for instance, the behaviour of hydrogen may be different with the new generations of catalysts. If we consider propene polymerization, it is now clear that hydrogen activates the polymerization [ 1-3 ] in addition to acting as a powerful transfer agent. The mechanism involved in the activation process is not clear, however [ 4 ] and, in addition, there are also deactivation processes linked to H2, chiefly at high H2 concentration [ 5 ] .Using the 14Co radiolabelling method, Parsons and *Corresponding author. 0304-5102/93/$06.00 1993 - Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. All rights reserved. 30 A. Guyot et al./J. Mol. Catal. 82 (1993) 29-36 Al-Turki concluded that the concentration of active sites is significantly increased in the presence of H2 [6 ] . According to Chien and Nozaki [71, the increase is mainly due to oxidation of Ti\" sites, which are non-active for propene polymerization, into active T3+ sites. However, that explanation is questionable because, at least with the most efficient generation of catalysts using phthalate/silane components as a stereoregulation system, the activation process by HZ is quite reversible, unless high concentrations of HZ are used, when the deactivation process is dominant [ 5 ] . A recent paper from Giannini et al. [8] suggests that the deactivation process results from a reaction between titanium hydride and the carbonyl groups of esters. Of course, that reaction does not occur with the silane compounds, and may explain the stronger deactivation observed when the external Lewis bases are aromatic esters. In this paper, experiments carried out over quite a large range of temperatures (i.e. 50-95 C) lead us to suggest another mechanism for chain growth interruption and for activation with H2. The experimental conditions for the preparation of catalysts, polymerization procedure and polymer analysis have been published in a previous paper [ 9 ] . Results and discussion A first series of experiments was carried out in the absence of hydrogen (Table 1) . The kinetic curve corresponding to standard conditions (70 C; (triethylaluminium) TEA: 6 mmole/l; (phenyltriethoxysilane) PTES/TEA: 1/10; monomer pressure: 4 bar) is shown in Fig. 1. Upon increasing the temperature, the activity is much lower, and the de- TABLE 1 Propene polymerization without hydrogen Run Overall Temperature Solvent AIRS AIR-[ ] Productivity Activity Melt pressure ( C) silane mmole/1 (g/g h after (rate at index (bar) 1 hour) 10 min)(IZ) 1 4 70 heptane 10 TEA-6 1500 0.3 2 4 95 heptane 20 TEA-6 360 2.3 3 3 95 heptane 20 TEA-6 200 2.1 4 4 95 toluene 10 TEA-6 280 6 5 3 95 toluene 20 TEA-6 180 17 6 1 80 heptane 20 TEA-6 364 100 7 4 95 toluene 20 TOA-6 150 2.7 8 3 95 heptane 20 TEA-3 50 0.2 9 3 95 heptane 20 TEA-12 300 2.8 TEA: triethylaluminium; TOA: trioctoylaluminium; silane=phenyltriethoxysilane.

Propene polymerization at 95 C (run 2 of Table 2) . crease in activity with time (deactivation) is more rapid (Fig. 2), while the molecular weight decreases but not very much if the monomer pressure is not decreased (Table 1, runs 1 and 2). When the temperature rises from 70 to 95 C, the melt index only increases from 0.3 to 2.3. The melt index increases a great deal if the monomer pressure is low. As shown in run 6 (Table 1) it can go up to 100 when the overall pressure is only 1 bar (including the contribution of the solvent), even if the temperature is around 80 C, which corresponds approximately to the maximum of activity. Note that the productivity in runs 2 and 6 are the same for 4 bars at 90 C and 1 bar at 80 C. The polymer obtained in run 6 is interesting because its molecular weight is low enough (it corresponds to an Mn around 22,000) that it should be possible to actually observe vinylidene unsaturation in the infrared spectrum, the bands corresponding to the expected. However, as shown in Fig. 3, the shoulder expected at 888 cm-1 (from the work of Luongo [ 10 ] and Longi et al. [ 11 ]) is no more visible in a polymer prepared at 95 C than in the spectrum of the polymer prepared under standard conditions in the presence of hydrogen. This means that the ss-elimination process, which is known to be 32 (a) A. Guyot et al./J Mol.

A second parameter which is important for the determination of molecular weight is the nature of the solvent. A comparison of runs 2 and 4 or runs 3 and 5 shows that the melt index of the polymer prepared using toluene instead of heptane is much higher, i.e. the molecular weights are much lower, with some reduction in the activity. The more polar nature of the toluene, or its ability to compete with monomer for site coordination, makes the chain termination process much easier. The last parameter governing molecular weight, of course, is the alkylaluminium concentration (runs 3, 8 and 9). This is obviously due to the well-known transfer reaction to alkylaluminium. However, it is inter- A. Guyot et al./J. Mol. Catal. 82 (1993) 29-36 33 esting to observe that the major effect of the alkylaluminium concentration concerns the catalytic activity. Fig. 4 shows the kinetic curves for these three runs; after an initial decrease, the activity tends to reach a plateau level which is approximately proportional to the alkylaluminium concentration. On the basis of the correspondence between the melt index 12 and the molecular weight [9 ] described by a proportionality of melt index to Mw 4, it may be estimated that, for run 3 for instance, the consumption of TEA corresponding to 80 g of polymer with Nn=80,000 is about 1 mmole, assuming all the polymer chains result from the transfer reaction. The TEA concentration is then almost constant, so that the almost steady polymerization rate, proportional to the TEA concentration, is significant. The data obtained in run 7, where TEA is replaced by the less reactive trioctoylaluminium (TOA) may be surprising: a lower polymerization rate and a higher molecular weight (as compared with run 4). The explanation lies in the fact that, at 95 C, TOA is not thermally very stable, being easily decomposed to give dioctylaluminium hydride which is able to reduce Ti3+ to Ti2+ species, which are inactive in propene polymerization [ 13 ] . We would like to suggest a mechanism which might explain both the absence of unsaturation and the effect of TEA concentration on the steady polymerization rate. That mechanism involves the formation of dormant titanium 7c-allyl species, which we have already suggested previously [ 14 ] . It is formally similar to the mechanism proposed by Jeske et al. [ 15 ] for the polymerization of ethylene with a neodymium catalyst. According to these authors, that catalyst is unable to polymerize any a-olefin, except ethylene, due to the formation of 7c-allyl species with saturation of the chain end of the polymer. Our mechanism of propene polymerization is similar and involves first a competition, after a propene monomer coordination, between an insertion into the growing polymer chain, and a decomposition into an inactive n-allyl species and an H atom which adds to the growing chain, giving a saturated isobutyl chain end (Scheme 1) . This accounts for the quasi-absence of unsaturation, 500 450 400 350 300 250 200 150 100 50 TIME (min.) Fig. 4. Propane polymerization at 95 C in the absence of HZ for various concentrations of triethylaluminium: 12 mmole/1 (curve 1, run 9 of Table 1); 6 Oole/1 (curve 2, run 3) or 3 mmole/1 (curve 3, run 8 ) . 34 A.

The second step of our mechanism is the reactivation process by TEA through a ligand exchange in a bimetallic species (Scheme 2) . This results in the formation of an active alkylated Ti and an a-diethylallylaluminium molecule. This reactivation process may explain why the steady activity is almost proportional to the TEA concentration. Further, it is expected that the activation process due to hydrogen may be explained by this mechanism according to Scheme 3. Hydrogen may react with the Ti-allyl species through a set of steps leading to a Ti Q propyl moiety, which is obviously able to reinitiate the polymerization. In that regard, it was interesting to investigate the activation process at various temperatures. Some typical data are reported in Table 2 for the temperature range 50-90 C. The experiments began in the absence of hydrogen and the activity was noted after 5 minutes (A5) and 30 minutes (A30). Then hydrogen (50 ml) was added under pressure and the activity was noted after 5 minutes (H5). A. Guyot et al./J. Mol.

A(30): activity after 10 minutes. H(5): activity 5 minutes after HZ addition. The H5/A5 ratio shows that the activation is best at the highest temperature. It is interesting to see that the activity for H5 at 90 C is not much lower than the activity at 70 C. This means that the spontaneous deactivation at 90 C was the main reason for the drop in activity after the maximum. The hydrogen activation process suggested here can be compared with the one recently proposed by Kashiwa and Kioka [ 161 for propene polymerization using an homogeneous catalyst system (bisindenylethylzirconium dichloride and methylalumoxane). This author reported an increase in activity by a factor of 3 for H2/propene ratio of 0.1; a study of the chain ends of the polymer reveals essentially n-butyl and n-propyl end groups, rather than the isopropenyl and 2-butenyl unsaturated end groups obtained in the absence of hydrogen. The explanation given by Kashiwa involves a reactivation step after deactivation following an anomalous head-to-head (or tail-to-tail) addition. In a previous paper [ 14 ] , we suggested that another activation process, due to ethylene, involves the same step as in the case of hydrogen. If this is true, one may expect the formation of unsaturated vinyl chain ends in that case. Further experiments are in progress in our laboratory to study the chain ends of low molecular weight polymers prepared at high temperature in the absence or in the presence of either hydrogen or ethylene.
