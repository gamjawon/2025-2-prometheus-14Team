KEJI KITAJIMA, MASARU MIYOSHI and SUSUMU TSUCHIYA Department of Industrial Chemistry, Faculty of Engineering, Yamaguchi University, 2557 Tokiwadai, Ube 755 (Japan) (Received November 16,1988; accepted February 28,1989) Lanthanides (rare earths) are elements that have not been widely in- vestigated. Recently we have carried out catalytic studies of low-valent highly dispersed lanthanide particles prepared by vaporizing metal atoms into organic matrices and have demonstrated that they exhibit unusual activity/selectivity [1 - 3]. Lanthanide catalysts prepared by metal vapor deposition, possibly best regarded as pseudo-organometallic particles [4], do exhibit enhanced activity for reaction. Here we report novel applications of such samarium and ytterbium metal particles as dimerization catalysts and present our preliminary findings on their catalytic properties. To the best of our knowledge, the selective dimerization of ethylene with a lanthanide catalyst has not been previously reported; nevertheless the study also con- cerns other catalyst systems [5]. The lanthanide catalysts were prepared by metal vapor deposition as described in earlier papers [1]. The apparatus for the preparation of the catalyst consists of a round-bottom glass tube, 35 mm in diameter X 350 mm long. After evacuation of the reaction system (ca. 10\"5 torr), Sm or Yb (0.4 - 0.5 g, 99.9%) was vaporized into a tetrahydrofuran (THF) or methyl- cyclohexane (MCH) matrix (7 - 8 cm3; distilled in the presence of sodium wire just before use) which had been condensed as a layer on the wall of the reactor cooled to 77 K. Upon completion of the low-temperature deposition, the reactor was warmed to room temperature and the excess organic solvent was pumped off, leaving black, pyrophoric powders (referred to as Sm/THF, Sm/MCH and Yb/THF). The catalytic activity was tested in a standard recir- culation system. It was found that these lanthanide catalysts exhibited activity for ethylene oligomerization and high selectivity to the formation of butene isomers. Ethylene was effectively dimerized into mixed n-butenes when *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/89/$3.60 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands L26 brought into contact with the samarium and ytterbium catalysts at 293 - 373 K (Table 1). The initial rates of lanthanide-catalysed dimerization in- creased with increasing ethylene pressure (20 -100 torr). Neither the dimeri- zation activity nor the composition of butenes formed was affected by the presence of a small amount of hydrogen. At higher temperatures the initial reaction rate was faster than at lower temperatures, but the catalyst under- went gradual deactivation, probably due to residual oligomers. Pretreatment of the catalyst by evacuation at elevated temperatures resulted in an increase in the catalytic activity. This thermal treatment in vacua apparently gener- ates open coordination sites by releasing organic species solvated on the lanthanide particles. Ytterbium similarly catalysed the conversion of ethyl- ene at 373 K or above, but less effectively. As shown in the dimerization at 373 K using Sm/THF (Fig. 1), but-2-ene predominated. Ethylene was selectively converted to trans-but-2- ene and cis-but-2-ene, and their ratio remained little changed throughout the TABLE 1 Results of olefin dimerization Catalyst Olefin (pressure/torr) Temp.

Time course of ethylene dimerization over Sm/THF at 373 K. The reaction was conducted by admitting ethylene (30 torr) over Sm/THF (0.15 g) which had been evacu- ated at 473 K for 2 h. L27 reaction. The ratio of butenes obtained was different from that upon isomer- ization by Sm/THF (cis/trans =2-3); no isomerization of butenes takes place before desorption. For Sm/THF and Yb/THF, negligible dimerization occurred with propylene at 373 K or above (Table 1). The reaction of an equimolar mix- ture of ethylene (30 torr) and propylene (30 torr) in the presence of Sm/THF gave 80% 2-methyl-but-l-ene and 20% cis-pent-2-ene, although the codimerization activity was low compared to the dimerization of ethylene alone. For the samarium and ytterbium catalysts, taking into account the findings obtained elsewhere [1, 3] that (i) the isomerization of butenes favored the cis-but-2-ene over the trans isomer and (ii) the isomerization of acetylenic hydrocarbons was a very easy process, these lanthanide metals may be characteristically classified as base catalysts [6, 7]. However, this is inconsistent with the fact that simple olefins which form allylic carbanions can undergo dimerization over alkali metal catalysts, which are inactive for the dimerization of ethylene [7]. The codimerization product distribution was markedly different from that via allylic anion intermediates. At present the scope of the catalytic reactivity of Sm/THF and Yb/THF is not yet fully established. However, clearly the low-valent lantha- nides have the potential to effect a variety of interesting transformations on unsaturated hydrocarbons. References 1 H. Imamura, A. Ohmura and S.
