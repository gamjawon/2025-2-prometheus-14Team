The performance of these catalysts can be enhanced by doping with different metal ions. However, the catalytic function of these promoters is still unknown. In the present work the influence of promoters (W, Mg, Nb, Te, Ga, Pb, Sm) on the surface acidic and bulk redox properties and on the catalytic performance of VSb5OJA1203 catalysts was investigated. The freshly prepared catalysts exhibited only small differences in their acidic and redox properties, while dramatic changes occurred under reaction conditions in the first hours-on-stream. The selectivity to acrylonitrile of the modified catalysts in the final state (after 5 h on-stream) increased in the following order of dopants: Sm, Pb<Ga< unpromoted <Nb, Te<Mg<W. In the same order the surface Lewis-acidity increased, while basicity decreased. The catalysts exhibiting higher selectivity to acrylonitrile also showed a higher degree of reduction of vanadium. In the W modified catalyst only the redox pair vIV/vm could be detected. It is concluded that in the Me promoted catalysts which showed better performance than the unpromoted catalyst (Me=W, Mg, Nb and Te) the role of the promoters is to catalyze the formation of the active and selective form of the vanadium, most probably a vlvSbO4 phase, or to stabilize this phase under reaction conditions. 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction Multicomponent-oxides based on vanadium and antimony are well known to be active and selective catalysts for the direct ammoxidation of propane to acrylonitrile [1-4]. Yields to acrylonitrile of YACN=21.1% (Xc3H8 =47.6%) were reported for pure *Corresponding author.

For obtaining high acrylonitrile yields an optimum Sb/V-ratio of 5 was determined in these catalysts due to a synergistic effect between vanadium and antimony [5]. However, the activity and selectiv- ity of these catalysts can be significantly enhanced by the addition of promoting metal ions (Te, Sn, W, Se, Fe), e.g., for a VSbsWo.5Teo.sSno.5Ox (50 wt%)/(20% SIO20% A1203) a yield to acrylonitrile of 39% (Xc3H8=68.8%) was obtained [6]. Although the pos- sible benefit of additive elements during ammoxida- tion of propane is notorious, only little is known how 106 H. W. Zanthoff et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 164 (1997) 105-117 the various promoter elements influence the physico- chemical and respective catalytic properties [7]. W and Sn are assumed to act as oxygen transfer agents in combination with V and Sb, while Te may be involved in the efficient NH3 activation and/or the N insertion step itself. For the related Ga-Sb-oxide system it was observed that the surface basicity, which is assumed to be essential for acrylonitrile formation, can be mod- ified by additives such as alkali and alkaline earth compounds [8]. Promoters as W and P reduce the number of active centers on the catalyst surface and decrease the number of strong basic sites in these catalysts [9]. A better understanding of the performance of pro- moter additives could help to design more active and selective catalysts for the ammoxidation of propane. Therefore, it was the aim of the present work to investigate the influence of the promoter elements on physico-chemical properties and catalytic perfor- mance of vanadium-antimony-alumina-oxide cata- lysts with particular attention to the acid-base and redox properties of the catalysts. The promoter ele- ments Pb, Sin, Ga, Mg, Te, Nb and W were chosen in order to influence mainly the acidic surface properties of the catalyst. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation The Me-V-Sb-Al-oxide catalysts modified with different metal ions (Me=W, Te, Mg, Ga, unpro- moted, Sm, Pb) were prepared according to Catani et al. [10] by redox reaction in aqueous medium. The VSb5Ox(30 wt%)/A1203 catalyst was chosen as basis material since this composition was described in literature to exhibit the best performance. NH4VO3 and Sb203 and AI(OH)3 were added in stoichiometric portions to a 1 M aqueous ammonia solution at 363 K. The suspension was stirred continuously under reflux for 24 h. For the promoted catalysts VSbsMeOx(30 wt%)/A1203 the respective amount of metal oxide or nitrate was added and the suspension was stirred under reflux for additional 3 h. The water was evaporated and the remaining solid was dried at 393 K for 12 h and calcined in air at 623 K for 24h, at 773K for 3h and finally at 900K for another 3 h with an intermediate heating rate of 50 K/h. The resulting catalyst was pelletized (2.5 t cm 2 for 15 s), grinded and sieved. Particles with a diameter of 255-350 gm were used in the experiments. Additionally, a pure A1203 sample was prepared from AI(OH)3 similarly as described above and a Sb204 sample by oxidation of Sb203 for 6 h in air at 773 K. 2.2. Catalyst characterization The catalysts were characterized with respect to their bulk and surface properties applying different methods before and after the catalytic tests. The crystalline phases in the catalysts were identified by XRD using a Phillips PW 1050/25 powder diffract- ometer and Cu-Ko~ radiation (1.5406 ,~) and TEM using a JEOL JEM 1200 EX microscope. The average valence state of vanadium in the catalysts was deter- mined by potentiometric titration of V3+, V4+ and V5+ with Fez+ and Ce4+ solutions according to a method described by Niwa and Murakami [11]. IR spectra (400-1200cm-l) of the catalysts were recorded using a Perkin-Elmer 1710 Fourier Trans- form Infrared Spectrometer (resolution up to 2 cm-1) in the diffuse reflectance mode (DRIFT). The BET surface of the catalysts was determined applying Nz-adsorption at 77 K in accordance with Haul and Diimbgen [12]. Surface acidic properties of the catalysts were determined by recording DRIFT spectra of adsorbed pyridine (for Me=W and undoped catalyst). The catalyst (10-20 mg, powder) was first heated in the DRIFT cell to 773 K in a flow of N2 to remove loosely bonded species from the catalyst surface. Then the catalyst was cooled down to room temperature and a gas stream of pyridine/N2 (10 ml/min) was fed to the catalyst and DRIFT spectra were taken after the surface coverage of pyridine reached a steady state. Surface acidic and basic properties were also deter- mined using NH3- and CO2-TPD measurements in a Differential Scanning Calorimeter Setaram 111 applied with a VG quadrupole mass spectrometer. Before the TPD experiments the catalyst samples (about 100 mg) were heated to 1000 K to remove surface impurities. Then the catalysts were treated with air (fresh samples) or with a C3H8/Oz/NH3/Ne mixture (catalysts previously used in reaction) at H.W. Zanthoff et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 164 (1997) 105-117 107 823 K for 1 h and cooled down to 300 K in He after- wards. NH3 or COz were pulsed over the catalysts until a saturation was obtained. After removing loosely bonded species by a continuous flow of He (20 ml/ min) the catalysts were heated linearly up to 1000 K (heating rate 20 K/min) and the masses 14, 18, 28 and 32 were recorded using a mass spectrometer. Additionally, benzoic acid titration with Hammett indicators was used to determine the number of basic surface sites. 2.3. Investigation of catalytic properties The performance of the prepared catalysts was determined in a microcatalytic fixed-bed reactor (i.d.= 1.4 cm) made of quartz under steady state opera- tion conditions. A constant modified residence time mcat/1~'=l.08 g s ml-a with an inlet gas mixture of C3H8/O2/NH3/Ne=l : 2 : 2 : 2.5 (Ptot=0.1 MPa) was used while the temperature in the reactor was varied between 720 and 960 K. The catalyst was diluted with quartz at a ratio of 1 : 2 in order to avoid temperature hot spots. The reactor was heated in a fluidized-bed of sand to achieve an optimum heat transfer. However, due to the strong exothermicity of the reaction tem- perature gradients in the catalyst bed could not be totally avoided and amounted up to 20 K. The pre- catalytic reactor volume was minimized by filling the voids of the reactor with quartz particles. This enabled to suppress the homogeneous gas phase reaction of the inlet gas mixture up to temperatures of 830 K. A contribution of gas phase reactions leading to an enhanced formation of propene from propane due to gas phase reactions, therefore, cannot be totally ruled out for the highest temperatures investigated. The feed gas and product gas compositions were analyzed on- line using a SATOChrom gas chromatograph equipped with a molesieve, a Fused Silica GS-Q capillary column, an FID and a micro-volume HCD. The following products were detected: C3H8, C3H6, C2H4, acrylonitrile, acetonitrile, CO, CO2, NH3, N2. HCN was not quantitatively determined. Carbon mass balances amounted to 97.4% (without HCN). Prior to the experiments the catalysts were treated for 5 h at a temperature of T=923 K in the reaction flow mixture as it was known [13] that the catalysts change their catalytic performance during the first few hours. 3. Results 3.1. Physico-chemical properties of the catalysts The catalysts prepared exhibit different bulk and surface properties before and after exposure to the reaction gas mixture. The BET surfaces of all freshly prepared catalysts were very similar and amounted to 965:7 m2g 1 which is about 20% less than reported by Catani et al. [10]. The surface area of the pure alumina sample amounted to 145m2g-1. After exposure to the ammoxidation gas mixture under reaction conditions the surface area of all catalysts was decreased by 20 m2 g-l. All catalysts, freshly prepared and used in the catalytic experiments, were mostly X-ray amorphous. In the XRD spectra of the freshly prepared catalysts the reflection patterns of ol-Sb204 (Cervantite; JCPDS: 11-0694) could be detected. After reaction the intensity of these reflections decreases (see Fig. 1). TEM/EDX and electron diffraction investigations revealed the existence of SbVO4, o~-Sb204, a A1- Sb-V-Me-O phase and \"y-AI203 in the catalysts. No indication was found for the presence of pure oxide particles of the promoter metals. Due to the high Al-content of the catalysts the IR- spectra are dominated by the absorption bands of the alumina. Therefore, the characteristic Sb-O, V-O and Me-O vibrational bands could not be observed. How- ever, a comparison with IR spectra of AI(OH)3 and different Al-oxides showed that the main part of the alumina exists in the \"7-A1203 form. The surface acidity of the prepared catalysts was determined by temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 from fresh samples and from samples after their use in the ammoxidation reaction. On the fresh samples of VSbsO~/AI203 and the various VSbsMeO~/ AlzO3-catalysts two kinds of acidic sites exhibiting different strength could be detected. The temperatures for the NH3 desorption were determined to To=4100K (peak maximum) and 580+20K (shoulder), respectively. From the amount of NH3 desorbed from the surface the number of acidic sites for the different catalysts was calculated. The values are listed in Table 1. The total acidic site density varied only slightly for the fresh catalysts amounting from 0.971017 to 1.81 1017 m-2 increasing in the 108 H.W.

The Nb, Te and Pb modified catalysts showed only small site densities for the higher desorp- tion temperature. The number of acidic sites of the Me-V-Sb-Al-oxides is much lower than for the pure A1203 sample, which amounted to 13.31017 m-2. For the catalysts treated under ammoxidation condi- tions the amount of NH3 recovered from the NH3-TPD H. W. Zanthoff et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 164 (1997) 105-117 109 strongly decreased for all catalysts due to a decrease of the number of acidic sites. The resulting site densities, which increased in the order: Sm < Pb < Ga, unpromoted < Te < Mg < Nb < W now exhibited strong differences for the different promoters amounting from 1.1 x 1016 tO 7.3 x 1016 m-2 (see Fig. 2(a) and Table 1). The NH3-TPD curves reveal that the number of both acidic centres decrease, but predominantly the one with the higher strength (see Fig. 2(b)). Additional information on the kind of acidic sites was obtained from DRIFT spectra of pyridine adsorbed as basic probe molecule. The spec- tra of the fresh and used VSbsWO~/AI203 catalyst are shown in Fig. 3. From this figure it can be deduced that the fresh catalyst exhibits BrOnsted as well as Lewis acidic sites [14]. Characteristic absorption bands for BrCnsted acidic sites were observed at 1540 and 1488 cm 1, respectively. Bands for Lewis sites were observed at 1610, 1549, 1580, 1482 and 1442 cm-1. After the reaction the Br0nsted sites on the surface have mostly disappeared as is revealed by the low intensity of the bands at 1540 and 1488 cm-1 in the spectrum. Additionally, after the reaction the absorption band for Lewis sites at 1442 cm-1 shifted to 1439 cm-1 and the bands at 1610 cm-1 are missing in the spectrum. The catalysts also possess basic sites as was deter- mined by CO2 temperature-programmed desorption and benzoic acid titration with Hammett indicators for the unpromoted, the W, Nb, Mg and the Sm promoted catalysts. The number of basic sites is ten times lower than the number of acidic sites. The fresh catalysts exhibit only one COz desorption peak (Tales=380 20 K) which can be addressed to a weak basic surface center. The number of sites determined by CO2-TPD experiments can be deduced from Table 1. The values determined by the benzoic acid titration gave the same trend with about 50% higher values (see values in brackets in Table 1). The higher values for the number of basic sites obtained when using the benzoic acid titration method might be due to the fact that benzoic acid is a stronger acid than CO2 which can therefore also interact with very weak basic sites. After reaction also the total amount of desorbable CO2 decreases. A new desorption peak at high temperature (Taes= 950 K) occurs for the Sm promoted catalyst, which might be addressed to strong CO2 adsorption sites, i.e., most probably carbonate formation. The total basicity of the catalysts after reaction exhibits the reverse order compared to their acidity: W < Nb < unpromoted < Sm The average vanadium valence state of the freshly prepared catalysts is about 4.4. For the unpromoted and the Sm-, Nb- and W-promoted catalyst V5+ and V4+ species were determined by potentiometric titra- tion in a ratio of about 2 : 3. The respective values are shown in Table 2. Due to the reductive character of the reaction gas (C3H8/Oz/NH3/Ne=I : 2 : 2 : 2.5; TR= 823 K;) all investigated catalysts become more reduced after reaction. The order of the reduction degrees of the vanadium is similar to the acidity/ basicity order: Sm < unpromoted < Nb < W the average vanadium valence state amounting from 4.3 to 3.9, respectively. The catalysts promoted with W and Nb only contained the redox pair vIn/VTM (see Table 2). 3.2.

(723-940 K) the propane conversion increases from 5% to 36%, while the oxygen conversion increases from 10% to 100%, respectively. In the same tem- perature range the NH3 conversion (not shown as a figure) increased from 5% to 40%. Fig. 5a and b show the yield of acrylonitrile obtained in the investigated temperature range 723- 940 K for the unpromoted and promoted catalysts. For all catalysts the ACN yield increases with temperature. At temperatures below 800 K all cata- lysts behave very similar showing an increase from about YACN=I to YACN=4%. For higher temperatures yields to ACN increase for all catalysts but with different slopes, running through a maximum between 850 and 890 K. The maximum obtainable yields to acrylonitrile and the respective selectivities for the investigated catalysts are listed in Table 3. The ACN yield increases from 5% to 13.2% in the same order of dopants as was obtained for the surface acidity, except that Sm and Pb have changed their places: Pb < Sm < unpromoted, Ga < Te < Nb < Mg < W 4. Discussion The promotion of the V-Sb-Al-oxide with various dopants Me (Me=Pb, Sm, Ga, Te, Nb, Mg, W) leads to changes in the physico-chemical and catalytic proper- ties of the catalyst. However, on the fresh catalysts the differences in the acidic and redox properties are quite small, while after treating the oxides under reaction conditions at high temperature (5 h at 923 K for all catalysts) strong differences in the physico-chemical properties of the promoted catalysts were recognized which also influence their catalytic performance. In the following possible processes for the changes of the catalysts under reaction conditions are discussed and the physico-chemical properties of the finally obtained solids are related to their catalytic performance. 4.1. Acidic properties of the promoted V---Sb-Al- oxides The results presented above showed that the cata- lysts exhibit surface Lewis- as well as Bmnsted acidic sites when freshly prepared.

Zanthoff et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 164 (1997) 105-117 sites of the modified V-Sb--Al-oxides is similar to that of pure alumina. The results of the pyridine DRIFT spectra further reveal that the acidic sites observed originate from the alumina in the catalysts. A com- parison with pyridine DRIFT spectra of A1203 and Sb204 (see Fig. 3) and also with VSb5Ox [15] reveals that on the fresh W-V-Sb-Al-oxide catalyst the Lewis sites can be attributed mainly to A13+ centers, because the absorption wave numbers, especially in the 1600 cm 1 region, mostly agree with that of A1203. The origin of the BrCnsted sites, however, remains unclear, since neither the AI203 nor the Sb204 or VSb5Ox samples showed a significant intensity in the 1540 cm-1 region of the pyridine DRIFT spectra. Most probably, they originate from VS+-OH (see Section 4.2 or promoter Me-OH groups on the sur- face). However, the presence of BrCnsted sites con- nected to antimony cannot be ruled out, since the very low surface area of the o~-Sb204 sample (2.2 m2 g-l) might have prevented their detection using the applied DRIFTS method. In a recent FTIR study Centi and coworkers observed Br~nsted sites on pure V-Sb- oxides [16]. After reaction, the acidity of the catalysts is differ- ent from that of the fresh catalysts. The changes in acidity can be explained on the basis of the NH3-TPD, pyridine DRIFT spectroscopic and XRD investiga- tions. The NH3-TPD investigations reveal that the total number of acidic sites is decreased for all cat- alysts and that the second desorption maximum for NH3 does not occur any more. Since the pyridine DRIFT spectrum over the VSbsWOflA1203 catalyst revealed that no significant number of Br~nsted cen- ters is present on the surface it might be concluded that these sites belong to the NH3 desorption maximum of about 600 K. This is also consistent with the fact that during reaction, at high temperature of 923 K, the catalyst loses water as was observed in separate TPD experiments under vacuum conditions [13]. The des- orbing water is formed most probably by condensation of surface and/or bulk OH groups as can be seen by a decrease of OH-absorption bands in the IR spectra of the catalysts in the range of wave numbers from 2800 to 3700cm-1. In consequence, this condensation causes a decrease in the number of BrCnsted acidic sites. The Lewis acidic groups of the fresh catalysts originate, at least partly, from AI3+ centers, as was discussed before. The absorption band at 1610 cm-~ for the fresh catalysts, which can be attributed to tetrahedric A1-Lewis sites (or Al-defect sites) of low acidic strength [17,18] have disappeared for the catalysts after reaction. There is indication by the DRIFr and XRD investigations and previous XPS measurements on pure V-Sb-oxide catalysts [5] that these surface sites are substituted by Sb sites, which can be explained by a coverage of the alumina sites by Sb. This assumption is supported by the fact that the pyridine bands for Lewis sites shift in the DRIFT spectra (from 1488 to 1482 cm-1 and from 1444 to 1439 cm-~) after reaction. The resulting positions are similar to those obtained for pure Sb204. The new Sb surface groups may originate from a surface enrich- ment in antimony, which was observed on pure V-Sb- oxides under reaction conditions by XPS measure- ment [5], or by spreading of Sb over the alumina. This may also explain that the proportion of crystalline Sb204, which is observed by XRD in the freshly prepared samples, is decreased after reaction. For such a diffusion process higher temperatures might be necessary as the catalyst calcination temperature of 823 K. Another explanation for the decrease of the number of acidic sites can be that carbonaceous-type deposits are formed during the preteatment procedure on the strong acidic sites under the reductive conditions (at nearly complete oxygen conversion). However, the same decrease in Brcnsted acidity and shift of the pyridine adsorption bands were also observed in the absence of NH3 in the reaction gas and at incomplete oxygen conversion. Additionally in vacuum transient catalytic investigations applying unpromoted V-Sb- Al-oxides, it was found that the changes under reac- tion conditions mostly originate from the thermal treatment of the catalyst [ 13]. Therefore, the influence of deposits on the surface on the observed changes in catalytic and acidic properties can be excluded. 4.2. Redox properties of the promoted V-Sb-Al- oxides Similar to the changes in acidity the valence state of the vanadium is affected by the reaction treatment. Vanadium, which is supposed to be the active and selective compound in the catalyst [3], is reduced during the reaction. About 40% of the vanadium of H. W. Zanthoff et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 164 (1997) 105-117 115 the fresh catalysts are present as V5+. Part of it is reduced to V4+ and/or V3+ after reaction treatment, the final average valence states being dependent on the promoter elements. The changes in the vanadium valence state under reaction conditions are similar as observed for pure V-Sb-oxides in previous investigations of Centi et al. [19]. These catalysts also contained 40% V5+ if calcined in air, which was assumed to exist as an amorphous layer or patches of VS+-oxide. After reac- tion in a C3H8/NH3/O2-mixture the remaining V5+ proportion was decreased and amounted only to 8% [19]. The residual of the vanadium in the catalyst was present as a Sb-V-O phase, exhibiting V4+ as well as ,/3+ ,T4+ qh3+ V3+, which was interpreted as --0.23--0.79~v0.40 Sb5.~o_xO4_2.5x assuming oxygen vacancies present in the catalyst [19]. The presence of Sb3+ in such V-Sb-oxide phases is, however, questionable since 121 Sb Mtissbauer spectroscopy data [20] clearly showed that compositions approaching SbVO4 contain Sb only in the pentavalent state. Andersson and coworkers [21,22], who observed similar V3+/V4+-ratios for a near stoi- chiometric ~SbVO4, therefore correlated their data to a rutile structure with cation vacancies [] with the 3+ 4+ 5+ formula Vo.l+4xWo.8_3xSbo.9170.2_x04(O < x < 0.2). However, the exact V~3 4-+/V + ratio might be higher under reductive preparation conditions, i.e., in oxygen free atmosphere a V3+/V4+ ratio of up to 4.5 was observed. The V3+/V4+-ratio of about 0.25, observed by Centi et al. [19], is almost achieved for the W promoted VSb5OffA1203 catalyst in the present work. Therefore, it can be concluded that an amorphous V5+ phase exists in the fresh metal promoted V-Sb-Al-oxide catalysts beside the VSbO4 phase observed by TEM/ EDX. During reaction part of the V5+ is converted to form additional VSbO4 with the excess antimony oxide. 4.3. Relation between physico-chemical properties of the promoted catalysts and their catalytic performance The promoted V-Sb-Al-oxide catalysts show sig- nificant differences in their catalytic performance in the ammoxidation of propane. ACN yields between 5% and 13.2% were achieved under the reaction conditions applied. The best promoter was found to be tungsten, niobium and magnesium, as was already reported in literature [7], while Pb and samarium were found to be the worst ones. Table 4 shows that the order of the promoters obtained from their catalytic performance can be explained by their acidic and redox properties. The highest yields were achieved over catalysts exhibiting the highest (Lewis) acidity, lowest basicity and highest vanadium reduction degree. The order of the promoters was always: Pb, Sm < unpromoted, Ga < Te < Nb, Mg < W Table 4 Comparison between catalytic performance and physico-chemical properties of modified V-Sb--A1-O catalysts (C3Hs/O2/NH3/Ne= 1 : 2 : 2 : 2.5; Ptot=0.1 MPa; meat/~r=l.08 g S ml-X; mcat=l.34 g) VSb5Me(30 Ma%)/ Ymax.ACN (%) Number of acidic sites Number of basic sites Average vanadium A1203 catalyst (~tmol m-2) (~tmol m-2) valence state Me~ W 13.2 7.3 0.1 <3.89 Mg 11.3 4.8 n.d. n.d.

Zanthoff et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 164 (1997) 105-117 From these results it can be concluded that the promoters which result in high yields and selectivities enhance the formation of the catalytically active and selective V3+/V4+-Sb-O phase under reaction condi- tions and/or stabilizes it in the catalyst. The V5+ sites that are present on the catalyst surface after prepara- tion led to total oxidation products and have to be removed in order to achieve highest ACN yields. This happens under reaction conditions most probably by the reduction with NH3 forming the undesired side product nitrogen. This conclusion is in agreement with the recent FTIR adsorption study of Centi and co- workers on pure V-Sb-O catalysts [16] who con- cluded from their work that in fresh V-Sb-oxide catalysts an amorphous vanadium(V)-oxide species is present which is completely reduced to a V4+ species during catalytic tests. They also indicated that the Br0nsted and Lewis sites does not originate from the same phases. The Br0nsted sites were attributed to supported Sb204 and the Lewis sites to supported V-oxide or the V-Sb-oxide phase. The latter statement is also in agreement with our conclusion, i.e. V4+ and Lewis site number correlate and are the carrier of the catalytic performance. However, Centi et al. [16] observed a correlation between the selectivity to acrylonitrile and the number of BrOnsted sites (converted by ammonia to NH+ sites), while in the present work a correlation towards the Lewis sites was observed. Therefore, further investigations are necessary to clarify this discrepancy. The ammoxidation performance of the applied catalysts is lower than those reported in literature for similar systems. Only about 13% yield to ACN has been obtained for the tungsten promoted catalyst, while in literature ACN yields over 20% have been reported under similar conditions. Although we used the same preparation method as reported in literature [10] as well as minor modifications (different heating rates during calcination; evaporation of the water during preparation under vacuum conditions) a simi- lar, reproducible lower performance compared to the literature data was obtained. We could not find any reason up to now for this different behavior. However, it is known that this catalyst system is very hetero- genous in its composition and the performance strongly depends on the method of preparation [2], a crucial step being the addition of the alumina compound. The lower performance of the catalysts used in the present work might be attributed to a higher oxidation rate of NH3 to N2 under ammoxida- tion conditions. The resulting lower NH3 partial pres- sure in turn reduces the reaction rate towards ACN formation and increases the rate for COx formation as we observed in recent kinetic investigations (unpub- lished results) using this catalyst and has also been reported in literature [10]. 5. Conclusions The results of this work reveal that the physico- chemical properties of V-Sb-oxide catalysts as well as their catalytic performance in the ammoxidation of propane to acrylonitrile is strongly affected by the presence of a further promoter metal ion. Acidity as well as redox properties are modified under the reduc- tive conditions of the ammoxidation reaction at tem- peratures above the optimum value to achieve high ACN yields. For a selective catalyst in the ammoxida- tion of propane a sufficient surface Lewis acidity is obviously necessary, while strong acidic sites as V5+ have to be avoided. Since V5+ is known to be able to activate and dehydrogenate propane to propene [23] it is assumed that the total oxidation of the propene and/ or its further intermediate to actylonitrile, acrolein [24], occurs on this site, most probably due to a too strong bonding of the adsorbed hydrocarbon.

The performance of these catalysts can be enhanced by doping with different metal ions. However, the catalytic function of these promoters is still unknown. In the present work the influence of promoters (W, Mg, Nb, Te, Ga, Pb, Sm) on the surface acidic and bulk redox properties and on the catalytic performance of VSb5Ox/Al2O3 catalysts was investigated. The freshly prepared catalysts exhibited only small differences in their acidic and redox properties, while dramatic changes occurred under reaction conditions in the first hours-on-stream. The selectivity to acrylonitrile of the modified catalysts in the final state (after 5 h on-stream) increased in the following order of dopants: Sm, Pb < Ga < unpromoted < Nb, Te < Mg < W. In the same order the surface Lewis-acidity increased, while basicity decreased. The catalysts exhibiting higher selectivity to acrylonitrile also showed a higher degree of reduction of vanadium. In the W modified catalyst only the redox pair VIV/VIII could be detected. It is concluded that in the Me promoted catalysts which showed better performance than the unpromoted catalyst (MeW, Mg, Nb and Te) the role of the promoters is to catalyze the formation of the active and selective form of the vanadium, most probably a VIVSbO4 phase, or to stabilize this phase under reaction conditions.
