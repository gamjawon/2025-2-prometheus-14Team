M. Dumas, C. Geron, H. Hadrane, P. Marecot and J. Barbier Universite de Poitiers, Laboratoire de Catalyse en Chimie Organique, 40, Avenue du Recteur Pineau, 86022 Poitiers Cedex (France) (Received January 3, 1992; revised March 15, 1992) Abstract Rh-Cu bimetallic catalysts were prepared by catalytic reduction under hydrogen of Cu2+ on Rh/A1203 parent catalysts, and were characterized using infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed carbon monoxide and hydrogenolysis of methylcyclopentane. Significant changes in the IR spectra as well as in the reactivity were observed upon addition of copper to Rh only if Rb/A1203 was well dispersed. This suggests that copper is selectively deposited on Rh surface atoms with a low coordination number. Comparison of methylcyclopentane conversion and IR spectral results for Rh-S and Rh-Cu showed that charge transfer could take place from Rh atoms at the phase boundary to sulfur and from copper to partially oxidized rhodium. Introduction A great variety of supported bimetallic catalysts has been studied, patented and used in heterogeneous catalysis. In many cases such catalysts preclude higher activity and selectivity [1, 2], and their preparations have been widely studied. Co- and subsequent impregnation techniques are often used, followed by high-temperature decomposition of the precursor compounds in oxidative or reductive atmospheres. But in the course of high-temperature treatments the formation of bimetallic surface species is not controlled, and the surface composition of the bimetallic phase is not well defined. Furthermore, catalystmakers are known to improve intimate contacts between the two metals, allowing `synergetic effects'. For this type of catalyst, new approaches should be used in order to obtain direct metal-metal interaction. One of these can be found in the preparation of the Pt-based binary electrode called the `immersion technique' [3, 4]. With the immersion technique a submonolayer from a second element may be deposited on the surface of a platinum catalyst by immersing hydrogen-covered platinum into an aqueous solution of the second element. This technique can be used to prepare supported catalysts under suitable experimental conditions [5-8]. Such a technique induces direct metal-metal interaction and can be applied to deposit hydrogen-reducible metals on all metals able to adsorb and activate hydrogen. In this way we previously developed [8] the `refilling technique', which allows an increase 0304-5102/92/$05.00 0 1992 - Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. All rights reserved 88 in size of supported Pt particles by reducing Pt\" ions by preadsorbed hydrogen on a metallic surface area. A similar approach, the `catalytic reduction' technique, was used to prepare various supported bimetallic phases from alumina-supported rhodium parent catalysts. The preparation by catalytic reduction and the characterization of Rh-CU/A1203 catalysts are reported in this paper. Infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed carbon monoxide and hydrogenolysis of methylcyclopentane (a reaction known to be sensitive to the changes that may occur in the sizes and shapes of the metallic aggregates) were used to characterize the catalysts. On the other hand, it was pointed out for Pt catalysts that copper and sulfur had opposite electronic effects [9]: copper would act as an electron donor and sulfur as an electron acceptor. Thus for comparative purposes, in order to distinguish a possible electronic effect, the Rh-S/A1203 system was also studied. Experimental Catalysts For preparation of the Rh-Cu/A1203 bimetallic catalysts, a parent Rb/ A1203 catalyst was obtained by exchange of the support (Rhone Poulenc GFS C alumina) with an aqueous solution of rhodium chloride hydrate. The exchanged alumina was then washed in water and the catalyst was dried at 383 K, calcined at 723 K and reduced at different temperatures (773 and 1173 K) in order to obtain samples with different dispersions (81 and 48%). The metal loading was 0.85%. Rh-Cu bimetallic catalysts were prepared by catalytic reduction of Cu\" under hydrogen on Rh/A1203 parent catalysts. In the course of this catalytic reduction, the addition of copper was carried out in a multifunctional reactor (Fig. 1). This system allowed hydrogen pretreatment (at 723 K) of the Rh/ A1203 sample (1 g), the immersion of the thus pretreated catalyst in acid aqueous solutions and the introduction under hydrogen flow of outgassed CUC12 solutions (5 X 10-' M) at room temperature. After 1 h of reduction under those conditions, the bimetallic catalyst was washed with distilled water and dried at 383 K. The amount of Cu deposited on Rh was determined by atomic absorption titrations of the aqueous solutions and by analysis of the copper loading of the catalyst. After preparation, all bimetallic catalysts were calcined at 723 K and reduced at 773 K. Sulfurized catalysts were prepared by reducing at 723 K sulfate ions deposited on Rh/A1203 previously immersed in aqueous solutions of ammonium sulfate. Metallic accessibility The dispersion (D%) of rhodium was determined by volumetric Hz adsorption. The sample was first reactivated in H2 at 773 K, then evacuated 89 V r H si Pt Y T Cu P Fig. 1.

(p < 10-' Pa) at the same temperature for 2 h. The isotherms were measured at 298 K between 0-13 Pa, and the volume adsorbed was determined by extrapolating to zero pressure the linear part of the curve. IR spectra of chemisorbed carbon aide A thin self-supporting wafer of catalyst was introduced into a highvacuum infrared cell. Prior to IR measurements the catalysts were reduced for 2 h at 773 K by flowing H2 and subsequently evacuated at the same temperature up to 10' Pa. They were cooled to room temperature, and CO was adsorbed at 10' Pa pressure until equilibrium was reached. The cell was again evacuated for a short time, and the spectrum was recorded on a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Nicolet 10-MX) with a resolution of 2 cm-'. The final spectrum was plotted after subtracting the catalyst background. 90 Catalytic experiments Methylcyclopentane (MCP, 99% purity, Fluka) conversion was carried out in a conventional flow reactor used in the differential mode. MCP was introduced into the reactor with the help of a calibrated syringe and vaporized in the preheated reactor inlet line. The experimental conditions were as follows: 493 K, a flow rate of 69 ml min-' and a H2/MCP ratio of 18:1. The conversion was always less than 10%. The reaction products were analyzed by on-stream gas chromatography, using a column (4 m X 1/8 in.) packed with 109'o Squalane on Spherosil . Results Rh/AL203 Figure 2 displays spectral features for Rh/A1203 (D%=81, 62 and 48), which have been well documented in the literature [ 10-15 ]. The pair of peaks at 2100 and 2035 cm-' has been assigned to gem-dicarbonyl species. The peak at 2065 cm-' is indicative of linear CO species, and the broad peak near 1865 cm-' suggests the presence of some bridge CO species. These results are in good agreement with those of Solymosi and Pasztor [15], according to which the higher the metallic dispersion, the higher the gem/linear ratio. The results of the MCP hydrogenolysis over Rh/A1203 catalysts are reported in Table 1.

During the initial period of the reaction, activity decreased and reached a steady-state value after about 1 h under feed. Thus the initial activity of the catalyst was calculated from the total conversion after 1 h of contact time (the deactivation magnitude after 1 h working is almost 2). On the other hand, the selectivities did not change over the course of the reaction. This indicates a self-inhibition reaction involving all accessible active sites. We can see in Table 1 that the TOF values increase approximately fourfold when the dispersion decreases from 0.81 to 0.48. A similar trend in TOF values with metal dispersion (or particle size) has been reported for similar catalysts [ 161. The selectivity patterns are also in good agreement with those reported in the literature [ 16, 171. As can be seen, the mechanism on Rh catalysts is essentially a'selective' one (using the terminology introduced by Gault [ 181). This means that there is a strong suppression of hexane formation, leading to a selective deviation from the statistical ratio 2MP:3MP:nHex =1:0.5:1. When the dispersion decreases it seems that n-Hex is formed in lower amounts, while the 2MP selectivity increases and the 3MP selectivity remains constant. Moreover, we notice greater hydrogenolysis ( < C6) on the dispersed sample. Finally, with regard to IR studies of adsorbed CO, the higher the activity and selectivity for 2MP (or the lower the selectivities for cracking products and n-Hex), the lower the gem/linear ratio. RhTCu/ALZ 03 Figures 3 and 4 show how CO adsorption was altered upon Cu addition to the Rh/A1203 catalysts. It appears that addition of 24 or 57 at.% Cu by catalytic reduction (C.R.) to the more dispersed Rh/A1203 (D = 81 %) catalyst induces (Fig. 3): 92 2035 2100 120 U C N O N a a 2160 2175 2035 2100 ~ 120651 C la a O N a a 1865 1865 D % Cu/Rh 48 0 D % Cu/Rh ( I ) 81 0 _ V 73 49 S.I. 46 15 44 24 C.R. 48 34 42 57 C.

Carbon monoxide adsorption on both copper single crystals [ 19 ] and reduced copper dispersed on different supports [20] is characterized by a band very close to 2100 cm-'. But according to Sheppard and Nguyen [20], the enhancement of the (CO) frequency of adsorbed monoxide with respect to the gas-phase value (2143 cm-1) is indicative of its interaction with oxidized clusters such as Cu\". Moreover, it appears that carbon monoxide adsorption on a reduced Cu/A1203 catalyst is totally reversible after evacuation at room temperature, while on unreduced catalysts chemisorption may be strong [21 ]. However, literature assignments of the bands due to CO interacting with copper centers disagree widely. Frequencies as high as 2204 cm-1 have been reported for CO interacting with Cu2+ ions on silica [22], and adsorption bands at 2175 and 2172 cm-' have been assigned to CO bound to isolated Cu+ ions on silica [23] and to Cu2+ on Zn0 [24], respectively. 93 For comparison, the results for the bimetallic catalyst (Cu/Rh = 49 at-0/6) prepared by subsequent impregnation (S.I.) are also reported. In this preparation the copper was introduced by impregnating the parent Rh/A1203 catalyst (D = 819'0) with aqueous copper chloride solution. The spectrum of adsorbed CO on S.I. bimetallic catalyst is, if we disregard the additional bands at 2160 and 2175 cm-' described above, quite similar to the one observed for Rh/A1203 (Fig. 3). The results of hydrogen chemisorption after HZ reduction at 723 K are reported in Table 1. The adsorbed amounts of hydrogen calculated as the ratio H/Rh (Cu does not adsorb hydrogen at room temperature) decrease upon Cu addition. Cu deposited by C.R. inhibits the hydrogen adsorption more strongly than Cu deposited by S.I. The H/Rh values were used to calculate the turnover frequency of MCP conversion (Table 1). The two bimetallics prepared by C.R. lead to identical changes in activity and selectivity. Activity and selectivity for 2MP increase, and selectivities for cracked products and for n-Hex decrease. The selectivity for 3MP does not seem to be affected. It is noteworthy that the addition of copper to Rh/A1203 (D = 81 %) causes the same shifts in the activity and in the product pattern as were evoked by an increase in Rh particle size. The catalyst prepared by S.I. shows a decrease in activity and less pronounced changes in selectivity. In contrast, the addition of copper by C.R. (15 and 34 at. ss'o) to the least dispersed Rh/AI203 (D=48%) does not induce major changes in the IR spectra of adsorbed CO (Fig. 4) and in the character of the MCP conversion (activity and selectivity, reported in Table 1). RhrSIAL2 03 Rh/A1203 catalyst dispersed at 81 lo was modified by addition of sulfur obtained from reduction of 5042- ions. The IR spectra showed that S042ions were not totally reduced. The titration of these unreduced 5042- ions was not carried out. Therefore the results are given with respect to the ratio of the total number of added 5042- ions to the total number of rhodium atoms. When the 5042-/Rh ratio increased from 0 to 57g'o, we noted the following (Fig. 5 and Table 2): (i) the IR spectra of adsorbed CO show that the ratio of the band intensities gem/linear decreases, but the band position remains unchanged (Mg. 5); (ii) the frequencies of the various IR absorption bands of carbon monoxide on rhodium are constant; suggesting the absence of a strong electronic effect; (iii) the accessibility falls by a factor of about 4 (Table 2). Activities in MCP conversion strongly decrease. Changes in selectivities follow the same trend as observed for copper addition, with the exception of n-Hex selectivity: 2MP increases, 3MP remains constant, and the formation of cracked products decreases, while n-Hex increases significantly. 94 2035 21 I2os5~ U C a Q 1865 D I 50427 Rh ( I 81 0 48 24 20 57 Wavenumbers / cm-1 2200 2000 1800 Fig. 5.

These changes are similar to the ones obtained by increasing the Rh particle size: IR band intensities of adsorbed CO attributed to `gem' species decrease, activity in MCP conversion is enhanced, relatively less n-Hex and more 2MP is formed upon ring-opening and less cracked products (< Cs) are produced. On the other hand, no such correlation can be deduced from the results obtained with the bimetallic catalyst prepared by subsequent impregnation. This tends to prove that in the case of subsequent impregnation, copper is deposited at random on all catalytic sites of the Rh/A1203 parent catalyst, whereas, in 95 the case of catalytic reduction, copper is selectively deposited on particular sites of rhodium. These particular sites, detected by IR spectroscopy, are responsible for the adsorbing of the CO gem species. Furthermore, the addition of copper by catalytic reduction to a poorly dispersed Rh/A1203 catalyst does not induce any modifications in the IR spectra of adsorbed CO and in the MCP conversion. Thus the catalytic reduction of Cuz+ ions on Rh/A1203 seems to be a structure-sensitive reaction occurring on metallic sites accountable for the difference between small and large metallic particles. On Rh/A1203 the TOF values were found to be high when the coordination number of rhodium was high. Thus it seems that the basal planes of the catalytic crystallite are responsible for an activity different from the one induced by the edge and corner atoms. Moreover, IR analysis of adsorbed CO on Rh reveals that the selective deposition of copper could occur on Rh surface atoms with a low coordination number. Consequently, the increase in activity and the changes in selectivity are on a par with the selective disappearance of edge and corner sites. Now, whatever the percentage of Cu (Cu/Rh atomic ratio being equal to 24 or 57%) specific activity, selectivities in MCP conversion and IR spectra of adsorbed CO remain almost constant. Such results can be explained if we assume that additional copper could either form three-dimensional deposits that would grow from the low-coordination sites, as suggested by Smale and King [25] for bimetallic Ru-Cu, or, as a consequence of thermic treatments, be located, in part, in the interior of the particle, as Meitzner et al. have shown in their EXAFS study on Rh-Cu clusters [26]. As we have seen, the deposition of copper by catalytic reduction, leading to the loss of Rh from defect-like sites at lattice positions, can affect the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. However, those results cannot be explained by the geometrical principle called the `ensemble effect' [ 1 ], which states that selectivity and activity depend on the dilution of an active metal (Rh) by an inactive one (Cu). On the other hand, they also cannot be explained by the electronic interaction principle called `the ligand effect' [ 1 ], which should be revealed by shifts affecting the vibration bands of the CO in the IR spectrum. Therefore, in this case, we must consider the rhodium sites whose nature is likely to have been perturbed by copper deposition and is revealed by CO adsorption; these sites thus become of the utmost importance. As previously seen, the IR absorption bands ascribed to Rh(CO)2 appear prominently on well-dispersed catalysts. It was recently shown [27-31] that the chemisorption of CO on small Rh clusters results in a disruption of Rh-Rh cluster bonds, followed by oxidation of the isolated Rh atoms. The OH groups of alumina are involved in the oxidation process. The following scheme was suggested by Basu et al. [31 ]: Rho + CO(g) ) Rh -CO (CO adsorption) Rh -CO --- (Rh -CO)* (surface moving species) 96 H RhI-CO (Rh -CO)* + ~ -0 -L + 2 HZ(g) ,RhI-CO OC-RhI-CO + CO(g) IR spectroscopic results thus suggest that the Cu addition by catalytic reduction on Rh/A1203 either perturbs adsorption on Rh atoms interacting with the support, or prevents the redispersion or oxidation of Rh crystallites as Rh(CO)2 cluster upon CO adsorption. We have recently [32] proposed an interpretation based upon the latter possible effects stated above. Under this interpretation, the addition of copper is considered a `sacrificial deposit' that can avoid partial oxidation of rhodium. Indeed, according to the standard electrochemical reduction potentials, Rh' + induced by CO adsorption can oxidate Cu . This assumption is supported by the decrease in the `gem' band intensity and the correlative appearance of bands at 2175 and 2160 cm-1 attributed to Cu species in an oxidized state. By comparison, the activity of rhodium decreases sharply upon addition of sulfur, showing a poisoning effect of sulfur in MCP conversion over rhodium catalysts, in agreement with previous work [16, 33, 34]. Nevertheless, IR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO shows that sulfur is selectively deposited on the low-coordination sites of rhodium, as is copper by catalytic reduction. We find, once more, the aforementioned relationship between the decrease in the `gem' band intensity and shifts in the selectivity for 2MP, 3MP and cracked products. But the relationship in question no longer exists in the case of the selectivity for n-Hex, since n-Hex selectivity increases significantly. The mechanism postulated by Gault and others [ 18, 35 ], which assumes that a nonselective ring opening, with formation of n-Hex, occurs an a,a,sstriadsorbed species bound to corner or edge atoms, cannot account for our results. However, Kramer and Fischbacher [36] have recently proposed for the nonselective ring opening an alternative mechanism based upon localised charge transfer occurring at the metal-support phase boundary. The positively charged metal atoms adjacent to the support would be responsible for the formation of n-Hex from MCP. In agreement with this assumption, we can assume that sulfur effectively invests the low-coordination sites of rhodium particles, facilitating the adsorption of CO gem species while leaving the rhodium-alumina interface untouched. As an electron-acceptor, sulfur can withdraw electrons from the rhodium adjacent to the support. The positively charged rhodium thus formed at the interface can enhance the formation of n-Hex. For sulfur, steric arguments can be evoked to explain the disappearance of CO adsorption on Rh as Rh(CO)2, in connection with our results in MCP conversion. 97 Conclusion The preparation of Cu-RhjA1203 catalysts by catalytic reduction of Cu\" ions on Rh, leads to selective deposition of copper on Rh surface atoms with low coordination numbers, as opposed to random deposition by subsequent impregnation. When a metal that is inactive for a given reaction is added to an active one, two effects are generally expected [ 1 ]: a `geometric' or `ensemble size' effect and a `ligand' effect. The first effect cannot account for our results. Indeed, the activity per surface rhodium atom in MCP conversion increases only when Cu is deposited by catalytic reduction on a well-dispersed Rh/ A1203 catalyst, and the `geometric' or `ensemble size' effect predicts the opposite behavior. Moreover, a significant `electronic' or `ligand' effect was not detected under our experimental conditions by IR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO. However, a comparative study of the selectivities in the course of MCP conversion, and IR spectra of adsorbed CO for Rh-S and Rh-Cu, has indeed revealed opposite electronic effects, but above all, that charge transfer could occur from Rh atoms (adjacent to the support) to sulfur and from copper to partially oxidized rhodium. This led us to propose the idea that copper can act as a `sacrificial deposit' able to avoid a partial oxidation of Rh metal [32]. References 1 W. M. H. Sachtler, Catal. Rev. -Sci.

Barbier Université de Poitiers, Laboratoire de Catalyse en Chimie Organique, 40, Avenue du Recteur Pineau, 86022 Poitiers Cedex France RhCu bimetallic catalysts were prepared by catalytic reduction under hydrogen of Cu2+ on Rh/Al2O3 parent catalysts, and were characterized using infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed carbon monoxide and hydrogenolysis of methylcyclopentane. Significant changes in the IR spectra as well as in the reactivity were observed upon addition of copper to Rh only if Rh/Al2O3 was well dispersed. This suggests that copper is selectively deposited on Rh surface atoms with a low coordination number. Comparison of methylcyclopentane conversion and IR spectral results for RhS and RhCu showed that charge transfer could take place from Rh atoms at the phase boundary to sulfur and from copper to partially oxidized rhodium.
