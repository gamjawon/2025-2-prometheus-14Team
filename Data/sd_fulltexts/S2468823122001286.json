A chemo- and regioselective gold-catalyzed tandem 6-endo-dig cyclization/enyne cycloisomerization/1,2-migration process for the synthesis of decorated peptidomimetics is developed. Various migrating groups such as aryl, heteroaryl and alkyl are tolerated in this method under mild conditions. This protocol is successfully utilized to modify various oligopeptides, including substrates bearing the drug amantadine, in a rapid and step-economical manner through the combination with the Ugi reaction. Graphical abstract Image, graphical abstract Keywords Peptidomimetic Oligopeptide Gold Post-Ugi Cyclization 1 Introduction The Ugi four-component reaction (Ugi-4CR) is one of the highly investigated reactions for diversity-oriented synthesis with high atom economy and bond-forming efficiency [1]. Multifunctional Ugi-adducts provide the opportunity for a myriad of post-transformations, increasing the molecular diversity and complexity in a fast and often experimentally simple fashion [2]. In the past decades, this strategy has already been broadly explored to enable the synthesis of highly functionalized polyheterocycles for high throughput screening to find leading compounds for medicinal chemistry, material science and complex natural product synthesis [3]. Peptidomimetics and peptides have emerged as a new class of drug candidates for clinical therapeutics with high potency and selectivity [4]. One major reason for the increased interest in these compounds is their ability in regulating protein-protein interactions, which have been demonstrated in a variety of disease-related biological process [5]. Thus, it is highly desirable to develop diverse strategies to prepare bioactive peptidomimetics and peptides with structural diversity. Compared to conventional approaches relying on solution-phase and solid-phase peptide synthesis [6], the Ugi-4CR could provide a facile way for the preparation of diverse, complex and structured peptidomimetics and peptides [7]. Gold-catalyzed tandem cyclizations are playing an important role in molecular catalysis, resulting in different types of complex heterocycles [8]. This is especially the case when IPrAuCl or JohnPhosAuCl is employed in 1,2-migration reactions through gold carbene or vinylidene species [9]. Recently, our group developed a gold-catalyzed divergent synthesis of polyheterocycles through a 5-exo-dig cyclization/1,3-migration process and a hydroamination/Michael addition sequence (Scheme 1 a) [10a]. Based on our continuous interest in gold-catalyzed tandem cyclizations [10], we herein report our results on late-stage diversification of peptidomimetics and oligopeptides (Scheme 1b). Through a gold-catalyzed tandem 6-endo-dig cyclization/ enyne cycloisomerization/1,2-migration process of Ugi-adducts, various highly functionalized pyrrolo[1,2-b]isoquinolines are prepared under mild conditions in a rapid, efficient, chemo- and regioselective manner. During this process, a possible 5-exo-dig cyclization of the amide moiety (derived from ammonia), as well as the hydroamination of the other amide moiety (derived from the isocyanide) must be avoided. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and methods NMR spectra are recorded on a 300, 400 or 600 MHz instrument using CDCl3 and DMSO‑d 6 as solvent unless and otherwise stated. The 1H and 13C chemical shifts are reported in parts per million relative to tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. Resonance patterns are reported with the notations s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet) and m (multiplet). The notation bs is used to indicate a broad signal. Coupling constants (J) are reported in hertz (Hz). HRMS spectra are acquired on a quadrupole orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Synapt G2 HDMS, Waters, Milford, MA). Samples are infused at 3 uL/min and spectra are obtained in positive (or: negative) ionization mode with a resolution of 15,000 (FWHM) using leucine enkephalin as lock mass. Thin layer chromatography are carried out using plates coated with 70–230 mesh silica gels. Commercially available reagents are used without additional purification, unless otherwise stated. Sealed tubes are dried in oven for overnight and cooled at room temperature prior to use. Melting points were recorded on a Reichert Thermovar apparatus and were uncorrected. 2.2 Preparation of substrates 1a-1x and 1aa To a solution of aldehyde (1 mmol) in trifluoroethanol (2 mL) were added successively Na2SO4 (0.3 g), ammonia (7 N in methnol, 2.0 equiv), acid (1.2 equiv) and isonitrile (1.2 equiv) in a screw capped vial equipped with a magnetic stir bar. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2–24 h in closed vial. After completion of the reaction, the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to obtained residue which was subjected to silica gel column chromatography (10–30% EtOAc in heptane) to afford the desired products 1a-1x and 1aa. 2.3 Preparation of substrates 1ab and 1ac To a solution of 1aa (0.3 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (1 mL) was added LiOH•H2O (0.45 mmol) dissolved in water (1 mL) and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 min. The resulting solution was acidified with 1 M HCl to pH = 2 and extracted with DCM. The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo to give the crude acid. To an ice-cooled solution of the above crude acid and N-ethylmorpholine (0.75 mmol) in THF (2 mL), isobutylchloroformate (0.33 mmol) was added dropwise and stirred under ice water bath for 1 h. Then amine (0.39 mmol) was added and the solution left to warm to room temperature and stirred overnight. The resulting mixture was concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by a silica gel column chromatography (n-heptane/ethyl acetate) to afford the product 1ab and 1ac. 2.4 Preparation of products 2a-2x, 2aa, 2ab and 2ac To a glass vial JohnPhosAuCl (5 mol%) and AgNTf2 (5 mol%) were loaded along with dry DCE (2 mL). Ugi product 1 (0.1 mmol) was added. The reaction vial was evacuated, backfilled with argon (6 cycles) and was stirred at 60 °C for 3 or 6 h. After completion, the mixture was loaded to silica gel column chromatography (20–70% ethyl acetate in heptane) to afford products 2a-2x, 2aa, 2ab and 2ac. 3 Results and discussion We commenced our study on gold-catalyzed 1,2-migration reactions by examining peptidomimetic 1a, which was readily prepared through Ugi-4CR (Table 1 ). Diverse gold catalysts were examined, suggesting that in situ formed JohnPhosAuNTf2 is the best one (entries 1–6). The desired annulation product 2a, which possesses a pyrrolo[1,2‑b]isoquinoline scaffold that is widely present in many bioactive natural products [11], was isolated in 82% yield (entry 6). Other chloride scavengers such as AgOTf and AgSbF6 were employed, but led to lower yields (entries 7–8). With the optimal conditions in hand, we subsequently investigated the performance of peptidomimetics with various migrating groups (Table 2 ). The substrates with electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups derived from the corresponding aldehydes worked sufficiently well (2a-2h). The migrating phenyl group bearing (R1) a para methoxy (2a), hydroxyl (2b), methyl (2c), tert‑butyl (2d) or hydrogen (2e) moiety was applicable, giving the desired products in 41% to 82% yield. A migrating phenyl group bearing a para chloride (2f), fluoride (2g) or ester (2h) moiety was also compatible, although delivering the products in moderate yields. Substrates bearing a 6′-methoxynaphthyl (2i), a heteraryl thiophyl (2j), even an alphilic cyclohexyl (2k), or a cyclopropyl (2l) were well tolerated by this 1,2-migration reaction, affording the corresponding products in moderate to good yields. Subsequently, we evaluated the compatibility of peptidomimetics bearing various R3-substituents derived from the corresponding acids (Table 2). Substrates with a methyl (2m), ethyl (2n), propyl (2o) or pentyl (2p) group reacted smoothly and delivered the products in good yields. For the aryl- and heteroaryl-substituted substrates, the final products (2r and 2q) were also obtained in good yields. Substrates bearing a methoxy (2s) or a fluorine (2t) substituent derived from the corresponding aldehydes, were performing well, resulting in the corresponding products in excellent yields. Additionally, the structure of compound 2t was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Subsequently, the effect of the R4-substituent, derived from the corresponding isocyanide, was investigated. Substrates with various R4-groups such as tert‑butyl (2u), cyclohexyl (2v), benzyl (2w) or n‑butyl (2x) afforded the desired products in moderate yields. As shown in Table 2, the substrate bearing a tert‑butyl (2u) group gave a higher yield compared to those bearing a less bulky group (2v-2x). These results indicate that this reaction might be employed for the modification of peptides. Therefore we evaluated this reaction for the late-stage diversification of oligopeptides (Scheme 2 ). The dipeptide substrate 1aa was compatible with the reaction conditions, affording the corresponding product 2aa in 52% yield. Also tetrapeptide substrate 1ab worked well and delivered the desired product 2ab in 42% yield. Encouraged by these experimental results, we used this reaction to modify amantadine, which is a leading drug for treating dyskinesia [12]. To our delight, dipeptide substrate 1ac bearing amantadine afforded the desired product 2ac in good yield. Based on the previous work on 1,2-migration through gold carbene [8,10] and our experimental results, a plausible mechanism for this transformation is proposed (Scheme 3 ). Firstly, substrate 1 undergoes alkyne coordination with the gold(I) catalyst to give intermediate A. This is followed by a sequential nucleophilic 6-endo-dig cyclization and cycloisomerization, resulting in the formation of gold carbenoid intermediate C. After 1,2-migration of the R2-group, product 2 is formed and the gold(I) catalyst is regenerated. Conclusions In summary, we have developed a chemo- and regioselective gold-catalyzed tandem 6-endo-dig cyclization/enyne cycloisomerization/1,2-migration process for the synthesis of diverse highly functionalized pyrrolo[1,2-b]isoquinolines. Various migrating groups like aryl, heteroaryl and alkyl are tolerated in this approach using mild conditions. The Ugi reaction sets the stage for the diversification of various peptidomimetics and oligopeptides in a rapid and step-economical manner, which is important for gold-catalyzed organic transformations used in molecular catalysis [13]. This method provides a new way to prepare bioactive peptidomimetics and peptides. CRediT authorship contribution statement Liangliang Song: Methodology, Validation, Formal analysis, Investigation.
