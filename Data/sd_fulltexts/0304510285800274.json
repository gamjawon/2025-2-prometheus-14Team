(Received June 16, 1983; accepted March 21, 1984) Summary Telomerisation of isoprene with water was studied on a polystyrene- divinyl benzene copoly mer-supported palladium catalyst. The influence of crosslinking, functionalisation techniques, isoprene:palladium ratio and recycling on the outcome of the reaction product distribution, yields and turnover, is discussed. In order to account for the similar terpenol select- ivities obtained with both polymer-supported and homogeneous catalysts, we suggest the occurrence of a monometallic palladium complex as the active catalytic species. Introduction We recently described our results on the cotelomerisation of butadiene and isoprene with water in the presence of palladium acetylacetonate in homogeneous conditions [1]. The quite remarkable regioselectivity observed (isoprene reacts exclusively by its tail end) is better explained on the basis of a monometallic reaction intermediate. However, other experimental data favour bimolecular r^-allylpalladium complexes as intermediates [2,3], especially because such derivatives have been isolated [4-6]. Homogeneous catalysts are generally quite reactive and selective; they can therefore be used in relatively mild reactions conditions as compared to those required for their heterogeneous counterparts. This advantage is balanced by the difficulties encountered in their recovery and recycling. These considerations, and the need for continuous processes, has increased the interest in heterogenisation of homogeneous catalysts [7] by attaching *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/85/$3.30 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 198 them to various supports, and particularly to organic polymers. Even asym- metric catalysis can be achieved by this efficient procedure [8]. One of the problems in the technique of employing polymer-supported homogeneous catalysts is the selection of the appropriate polymer support which enables the reaction under investigation to proceed satisfactorily. In addition, one to has to decide whether the metallic catalyst will be fixed on the polymer support by cr [9,10], n [11, 12] or ligand bonding [13 -16]. We selected a copolymer of styrene where addition of various amounts (2 - 20%) of divinylben;;ene gives rise to different states of reticulation. Such polymeric supports are extensively used, and give satisfactory results even in asymmetric catalysis [8]. They also allow easy fixation of palladium catalysts by phosphorus ligands [7, 17,18] which can be randomly grafted on the aromatic residues of the polymer backbone. In the present paper, we report our results on telomerisation of iso- prene with water using polymer-attached palladium acetylacetonate. The purpose of this work was threefold: to compare the reaction outcome [19], and particularly the product distribution in such heterogeneous conditions, with previous results obtained in homogeneous solution [2]; to gain further insight in the molecular aspect of the reaction mech- anism and on the intermediate active species involved; to study the catalytic activity of the polymer-anchored palladium on the telomerisation of isoprene with water. Results Preparation of the catalysts Introduction of phosphorus ligands on polystyrene-divinylbemene copolymer Two techniques have been used to prepare either A or B type phos- phinated copolymer (see Scheme 1). Preparation of type A resin: Polystyrene* is chloromethylated in the para position with chloromethyl methyl ether in the presence of zinc di- chloride [20]. An appropriate reaction time, as well as a good swelling solvent such as CHyC^, are necessary in order to achieve a satisfactory chloromethylation of the aromatic rings and to avoid crosslinking such as shown in (a) on Scheme 1 [21]. It is thus possible to obtain resins with a 23% chlorine content, which means that almost every individual aromatic ring is functionalised. The chloromethylated polystyrene is then further *In the discussion we will designate the polystyrene-divinylbenzene copolymer as polystyrene. We thank Prof. Dr. B. Fell, Institut fur Technische Chemie und Petrolchemie der RWTH, Aachen, for providing us with various samples of these copolymers.

In order to achieve a complete substitution of the chlorine atoms, it appears neces- sary to use a rather large excess (between 5 and 10 times) of the phosphorus reagent. If the chlorine substitution is incomplete, and if as little as 0.5% of chlorine is left in the polystyrene, our experience has shown that the sup- ported catalyst prepared later is inefficient in the isoprene telomerisation with water. This is likely to be due to a quaternisation reaction [7] : CH^-CH-CHg-CH- CH^-CH CH^ CH- ^ ^ ^) (^ a- CH^ CHzCI CH2 CH2 l \"^ D '^^ PPho ;P. pi-r ^^ph Unfortunately it was not possible to functionalise polystyrene contain- ing 18% divinylbenzene by this technique, probably because the pores of the copolymer are too small. Preparation of type B resin: Techniques involving para bromination of the aromatic rings in presence of iron catalysts [23, 24] are usual. How- ever, as we found some difficulties in mastering the bromination reaction, we preferred to lithiate the aromatic ring with butyllithium in the presence of tetramethylene diamine in cyclohexane according to Grubbs [25] (Scheme 1). The lithiated polymer is then treated with an excess ofClPPh; to yield resin B. Unfortunately, this technique does not work with 8% divinylbenzene-crosslinked polystyrene. Anchoring of palladium on the phosphinated polystyrene Several attempts at anchoring were made using Pd(PPh3)4 [26], but the catalysts thus prepared proved to be inefficient in the isoprene telomerisa- tion. with water. The use of PdCl;, followed by reduction with hydrazine hydrate in the presence of triphenylphosphine [27], yielded a catalyst which still contained chlorine. In order to anchor palladium properly on our resins, we finally used Pd(acac)2 in the presence of triphenylphosphine [28]. The catalyst thus obtained was active in the telomerisation of isoprene with water. Data on the palladium content and the phosphorus/palladium ratio are reported in Table 1. Telomerisation of isoprene with water Unless otherwise specified (see for instance run 12, Table 2) the reac- tions were run with stirring for 18 h at 90 C; a longer reaction time and *The chloromethylated polystyrene can also be treated with chlorodiphenylphos- phine in the presence of metallic lithium according to [22]. 201 TABLE 1 Elemental analysis of polystyrene-bound catalysts\" Polymeric % Divinyl- Type of P Pd P/Pd catalyst benzene phosphinated resin (wt.%) (wt.%) (mol) la Ib Ic Id Ie II III 2 2 2 2 2 8 18 A B B B B A B 4.90 2.90 2.90 0.98 0.98 2.70 2.20 4.82 2.56 7.67 1.12 3.37 2.65 1.89 3.5 3.9 1.3 3.0 1.0 3.5 4.0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 A= | ^0) CH2PPh2 B= I ^O) ^^ ^Vot calculation see experimental section. higher pressures favour the dimer formation. All the experiments were carried out under 20 bar pressure of CO; which was introduced into the reaction medium as dry ice. The role of the addition of CO; has been dis- cussed [29, 30] and is known to improve the yields of telomerisation [1, 3]. The solvent generally used was THF, because of its good swelling ability; furthermore its low viscosity allows good diffusion in the polymeric support, as well as easy and rapid separation of the reaction products from the sup- ported catalysts [1,2]. This is not so much the case for HMPA, which actually gave better results with homogeneous catalysts. Terpenols were separated from the oligomers by column chromatography, then further analysed by gas-liquid chromatography. As in homogeneous catalysis condi- tions [2] seven products (tail-to-tail, tail-to-head and head-to-tail) could be identified (see Scheme 2). The results reported in Table 2 deserve several comments related to the peculiar reaction conditions. Generally speaking, it should be noted that head-to-head terpenols are never observed in the reaction mixture. The relative percentage of head-to-tail terpenols always remains low (between I and 7%), whatever the nature of the polymer-supported catalyst and the reaction conditions. The main terpenols are of the tail-to-tail type and can comprise up to 88% of the alcohols (run 9). Influence of experimental conditions (Table 2) Influence of crosslinking: A high degree of crosslinking lowers the con- version and has some influence on the terpenol selectivity (compare runs 1, II and 14). In the latter case, the relative amount of Pd versus isoprene must be increased in order to observe a significant conversion and turnover. For a given crosslinking, the conversion can be improved by lengthening the reaction time (compare runs 11 and 12) but this results in a marked decrease TABLE 2 Telomerisation of isoprene with water on polystyrene-supported palladium catalyst : influence of experimental conditionsa Run Polymericcatalyst Isopre ratio ne/Pd Palladium (mmol) Conversion of isoprene(%) Turnover % Products Selectivity1' dimers terpenols tt th ht 7 1 2+3 4 5+6 1 2 34 5 678 9 10 11 12e 13 14 la Ib Ib Ib Ib Ib Ic Ic + P(Ph)3 Id Ie II IIn III 375 405 400 750 1000 1250470375 375 811 280 11 1 1 1 111 1 1 1 0.40 0.37 0.20 0.20 0.20 0.20 0.47 0.20 0.32 0.1 0.40 0.40 0.37 0.50 77 68 69 33 34 35 47 44 48 24 45 81 54 37 289 270 276 262 340 437 147 264 252 237 170 300 437 100 48 36 77 64 63 85 56 74 44 46 70 90 72 25 52 64 23 36 37 15 44 26 56 54 30 10 28 75 33 40 32 40 47 18 29 55 36 36 40 52 49 19 14 22 32 4 36 4 22 15 34 4 59 1 46 12 22 11 52 1 51 2 17 26 9 30 25 12 62 1 27 18 24 19 10 20 8 8 8 8 14 6 11 17 4 6 4 4 5 2 5 4 2 2 3 3 3 1 \"Standard conditions: 15 ml THF as solvent in a steel autoclave; isoprene :water = 1.5:1 ; temperature 90 C; COz pressure 20 bar; the reaction mixture was stirred for 18 h. ^tt: tail-to-tail ;th: tail-to-head;ht: head-to-tail.

The latter has its optimum value at a high degree of crosslinking (run 14) which, however, has other drawbacks (low con- version and turnover), as already mentioned. Influence of the functionalisation technique: This influence can only be analysed for type I polystyrene-supported catalysts, as the two kinds of functionalisation could not be achieved for II and III, as mentioned earlier. Comparison of runs 1 and 2 shows that there is no significant influence on the yield and turnover. But an increase in the terpenol/dimer ratio is ob- served with a high palladium content (run 2), a tendency which is reversed (run 3) when the palladium content is lowered. The selectivity in tail-to-head terpenols (4+5+6) is better for la than for Ib (compare runs 1, 2, 3). A similar influence of the phosphine structures has already been noticed m homogeneous conditions [2]. If a monometallic type intermediate is con- sidered [1] rather than a bimetallic one [2, 3] it appears that the structure of the tail-to-tail intermediate 8 is less hindered than the tail-to-head 9 (see Scheme 3). Polystyrene support A (in resin la), which is less hindered around phosphorus, is likely to fit better into the more hindered type 9 interme- diate, thus favoring the formation of 4 + 5 + 6 (run 1). In other words, an increase in steric crowding around phosphorus (going from type A function- alisation to type B, or from la to Ib) decreases the amount of tail-to-head products 4+5+6 (compare runs 1 and 2), which should also be affected in a similar fashion by an increase in the crosslinking if this idea of steric crowd- 204 l 9 H- l-h Scheme 3. Steric hindrance in a monometallic intermediate. ing is correct. This is indeed the case (compare the amount of 4 + 5 + 6 in runs 1 and 11, runs 2 and 14) but these variations are rather small and their significance might be questioned. Influence of the isoprene: palladium ratio: Transport phenomena are likely to play an important role in telomerisation reactions on polymer- supported catalysts. When the amount of isoprene is increased relative to palladium, the conversion drops significantly to lower values and then remains practically constant (compare run 3 with runs 4, 5 and 6). This means that the turnover progressively increases (from 262 to 437). Con- sequently, as the reaction obviously proceeds more rapidly, it is clear that transport phenomena neither play a decisive role nor act as a limiting factor. The terpenol/dimer ratio and the terpenol selectivity vary in a quite irregular manner. Influence of recycling (Table 3) One of the major interests in polymer-anchored catalysts is the ease with which they can be separated from the reaction medium. However in order to be useful, these catalysts must retain their activity. We have there- fore examined their catalytic properties after recycling, and our results are reported in Table 3. We have essentially compared the behaviour of a 2% divinylbenzene-crosslinked copolymer functionalised by either technique A or B to give la and Ib. In both cases the conversion and turnover decrease slowly after several recycles. For la, of the benzyldiphenylphosphine type, the terpenol :dimer ratio and the terpenol selectivity are not markedly altered. For Ib, of the triphenylphosphine type, however, the turnover de- crease is balanced by the terpenol :dimer increase after each recycle. The terpenol selectivity is slightly modified, but the overall amount of 1 + 2 + 3 remains roughly constant at around 75%. The lowering of the catalyst activ- ity after recycling is likely to be due to metal aggregation, or to separation of the metal from its polymeric support. The latter process is the most likely. In the presence of added triphenyl- phosphine, catalyst Ic, which already has a relatively high palladium content, gives relatively low conversions (run 10). The conversion and the turnover are significantly lowered after one recycling (run 11) in the presence of TABLE 3 Telomerisation of isoprene with water catalysed by resin-anchored palladium : effect of recycling\" Run Polymeric catalyst Palladium (mmol) P/Pd/ P(Ph)31' ratio Conversion of isoprene(%) Turnover % Products Selectivity' dimers fcerpenols tt th ht 1 2+3 4 5+6 7 1 2 34 567 8 910 11 la recycle recycle recycle recycleIbrecycle recycle recycleIcrecycle 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.400.37 0.37 0.37 0.370.20 0.20 3.5:1:0 3.5:1:0 3.5:1:0 3.5:1:0 3.5:1:03.9:1:0 3.9:1:0 3.9:1:0 3.9:1:01.3:1:2 1.3:1:2 77 70 60 45 2868 72 63 5244 12 289 265 225 168 105270 286 251 20626472 48 44 48 41 4464 75 60 5374 54 52 56 52 59 5636 25 404726 46 33 33 32 31 2840 53 38 4055 48 14 14 14 13 1432 25 32 3222 24 22 27 23 26 23 27 25 28 27 204 18 1 17 3 21 4 1011 6 14 9 4 4 4 3 36 4 6 64 4 \"Reactions were run in THF (15 ml) in a steel autoclave: isoprene 0.15 mol; isoprene :water = 1.5:1 ; temp. 90 C; CO^ pressure 20 bar; the mixture was stirred for 18 h. ^'Pree P(Ph)3 added to the reaction mixture. \"tt: tail-to-tail ;th: tail-to-head; ht: head-to-tail. 206 triphenylphosphine.

Fur- thermore, the low density and viscosity of THF allow a good separation of the catalyst by filtration or decantation. We have carried out another set of experiments with HMPA, which is another solvent currently used in homo- geneous catalysis. A relatively high palladium content and P/Pd ratio are necessary to observe good isoprene conversions (compare runs 5 and 6). However when the P/Pd ratio is raised to a value as high as 10/1, the reac- tion stops. Similarly, when the substitution of the polymer with phosphorus atoms is too great, the chances of a significant interaction between the palladium atoms increase, leading to the formation of metallic clusters which have no catalytic activity. Such a situation is observed when 36% of the polystyrene aromatic rings are phosphorus-substituted. Our results are reported in Table 4, where it can be seen that with catalysts Ib and Ic the conversions and the turnovers are similar for both solvents but generally less satisfactory when HMPA is used (compare runs 1 and 7 or 3 and 9). After one recycling, more differences arise: (a) for Ib: in THF the turnover increases (runs 1 and 2) but the ter- penol:dimer ratio is lowered; in HMPA a reverse situation is observed: the turnover decreases (runs 7 and 8) whereas the terpenol:dimer ratio is in- creased. (b) for Ic: in both solvents, the turnover decreases after one recycling, but is accompanied by an increase of the terpenol:dimer ratio which is more significant in HMPA (runs 3 and 4, 9 and 10). Comparison between homogeneous and polymer-supported catalysis (Table 5) Runs 1 and 2 (Table 5) confirm that homogeneous catalysts give better yields than their polymer-supported equivalents. But it can be noted that an increase in the reaction time lowers the differences: after 42 h (runs 5 and 6) equal turnovers are observed. Unfortunately, this lengthening of the reaction time results in a decrease of the terpenol:dimer ratio under both homo- geneous and heterogeneous conditions (compare runs 1 and 2 with runs 5 and 6). The terpenol selectivity is also less satisfactory with heterogeneous catalysts.

It can also be noted that there is a marked amount of tail-to-head terpenols (especially 5+6) which is formed under heterogeneous conditions after an average reaction time (run 3). A small influence of the solvent can be observed: the highest turnover is observed with HMPA under homogeneous conditions (run 8), but the terpenol:dimer ratio is not much affected (compare runs 3, 4 and 7,8). Reaction mechanism Previous work [1-3] has shown that it is difficult to decide between mechanisms which involve either mononuclear or dinuclear palladium inter- mediates. The second mechanism is often considered, because bridged bimetallic palladium intermediates such as 10 (Scheme 4) have been isolated from telomerisation of butadiene with acetic acid [31]. Furthermore a high palladium content improves the conversions in homogeneous conditions [3]. This is also the case under heterogeneous conditions, but it should be noted (see Table 4, runs 5 and 6) that this is not necessarily accompanied by an influence on the turnovers. The basic argument which favours a mononuclear mechanism is the observation of steric effects on the regioselectivity of telomerisation [1]. Such effects seem to play a role in heterogeneous conditions, as discussed above. On the other hand, quite good terpenol selectivities have been ob- served (see Table 4) for low P/Pd ratios. It seems difficult therefore to imagine the presence of two neighboring palladium atoms on the polymeric support which form a bimetallic intermediate. Mononuclear bis(7r-allyl palladium) intermediates such as 11 (Scheme 4) have also been considered to explain the linear dimerisation of conjugated dienes [32]. Although there are some differences on going from homogeneous to heterogeneous catalysts (see Table 5), the general trends are similar, so that it is likely that the mechanisms are the same in both kinds of conditions [33]. In homogeneous conditions, terpenol 1 tends to be the major product whatever the experi- mental conditions. This seems to indicate that the nucleophilic attack is favoured on carbon 3 or 6 (see 11, Scheme 4) on electronic grounds. When the steric hindrance is changed by increasing the crowding around phos- phorus with the polymeric support (see Table 5), the relative amount of L L 10 11 Scheme 4. Possible bimetallic or monometallic intermediates in isoprene telomerisation. 210 terpenol 1 decreases in favour of 2 + 3, for instance. The nucleophile then attacks preferentially on carbon 1 or 8 (see 11, Scheme 4). Such observa- tions are better understood on the basis of a monometallic intermediate. Experimental Section All solvents were dried and distilled under argon. Argon itself was dried on molecular sieves and purified from any traces of oxygen with BASF- catalyst R3-11. Carbon dioxide and isoprene were used as commercial grades. Palladium acetylacetonate was obtained from Merck. The terpenols were analysed on a 75FD Intersmat gas Chromatograph as indicated [1]. Quantitative GLC data were obtained via electronic integration on a Spectra- physics Minigrator. Thii yields of organic products (after removal of iso- prene) were estimated using a balanced average molecular weight for ter- penols and dimers. The relative amounts of terpenols and dimers were deter- mined by column chromatography on 230 - 400 mesh SiO^. The turnover (extrapolated back to an 18 h period) is calculated by multiplying the yield by the isoprene/palladium molar ratio. The relative ratio between the ter- penols is considered as the selectivity. The P/Pd ratio is the molar ratio determined from the percentage molecular weight of phosphorus relative to that of palladium. The phosphorus content is determined by iodometry, whereas the amount of palladium is calculated from the quantity ofPd(acac)2 fixed on the polymer. Chloromethy lotion of polystyrene [19, 20] and treatment with LiPPh^ Polystyrene (5 g), chloromethyl methyl ether (15 g) and ZnCI; (2 g) were mixed in CHiCl; until a volume of 100 ml was reached, using the technique of Jacobelli [21]. The reaction mixture was heated at 50 C for 10 h and then treated with methanoi, filtered, washed with water in order to eliminate any free chlorine and finally dried under high vacuum. LiPPh; was prepared by treatment of CIPPhi with Li in THF at 70 C (if PPha is used as starting material an equivalent of t-BuCl must be added before treatment with the chloromethylated polystyrene). Chloromethylated polystyrene was added in at least five times excess of the freshly prepared PPhzLi, stirred at 40 C for 3 h and later at room temperature for 15 h. Water was then added slowly, and the mixture was filtered and washed several times with water containing 10% NI^Cl, with a 1/1 mixture of water and THF, with pure THF and finally dried. The phosphorus content was determinated by addi- tion of an excess of iodine in ethanol followed by titration with a PPh3 solution. Lithation of the polystyrene phenyl rings and phosphination [25, 34] Approximately 10 g of copolymer purified according to Fylesand [34] was suspended in 80 ml of freshly distilled cyclohexane. Then 40 ml of TMEDA and 120 ml of a 0.1 molar solution of BuLi were added, and the 211 reaction mixture was heated at 60 C for 4 h. The liquid was removed with a syringe and the lithiated polystyrene was washed several times with THF. A 100 ml suspension of this polymer was then treated with a two-fold excess of CIPPh;. After two days stirring, the reaction mixture was filtered and washed with THF, a mixture of 10% I^Cl in H^O and THF (1:1), a 1:1 mixture of H^O/THF and pure THF. After drying, the phosphorus content was determined as above. Anchoring of palladium acetylacetonate [28] The amount of Pd(acac)2 was calculated as a function of the phos- phorus content and of the desired P/Pd ratio, and this amount was dissolved in THF. The resulting solution was added to the functionalised polystyrene and stirred at 40 C during 4 days. The reaction mixture was filtered and washed ten times with 30 ml of THF. The difference between the amount of Pd(acac)2 initially added to polystyrene and of the Pd(acac)2 recovered in washings gave the palladium content of polystyrene (see Table 1). Telomerisation of isoprene The reaction was carried out in a 100 bar proofed 75 ml V44 steel autoclave. The catalyst, corresponding to the amounts of Pd reported in the various tables, was suspended in THF in a Schlenk tube. A mixture of isoprene and water in the molar ratio 1.5:1 was added, and the reaction mixture was transferred to the autoclave. A 20 bar pressure of CO^ was introduced before heating began, until the pressure no longer dropped below 20 bar after some shaking. The autoclave was heated to 90 C. After the reaction was terminated (see reaction times in Tables), the autoclave was cooled in water and COs was released. The reaction mixture was collected in a syringe under argon and introduced into a 250 ml round flask. The catalyst which decanted was washed several times with THF and could then be re-used. The various THF solutions were collected and were evaporated at room temperature in a Buchi Rotavapor apparatus. Terpenol analysis The terpenols were separated from the oligomers by column chro- matography on silica gel 60 (230 - 400 mesh). The oligomers were eluted with pure hexane, and the terpenols with ethanol. The gas Chromatographie separation of terpenols was carried out on a 100 m (0.5 mm i.d.) Carbowax column at 100 - 200 C with a 3 C min\"1 heating program (injector: 220 C, carrier N2). All terpenols were identified by comparison with products of known structure [2].
