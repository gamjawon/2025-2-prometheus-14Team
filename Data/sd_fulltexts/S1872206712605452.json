Evaluations of catalytic activity showed that the catalyst prepared from these materials has reduced capacity for the oxidation of SO2 but high catalytic activity towards the oxidation of hydrocarbons (HC) and CO, and is also able to convert the exhaust soluble organic fraction at temperatures as low as 140 Â°C.

Keywords: Oxygen storage material Titanium Zirconium Composite material Chromiumâ€�modified molecular sieve Oxidation catalyst Â Â The significant progress in diesel engine technology to date has resulted in rapid development of the diesel vehicle indusâ€� try. Diesel vehicles have become increasingly popular, partly because of their superior fuel economy, but also because they are durable and provide excellent performance. Diesel engine exhaust, however, contains a number of toxic or otherwise harmful compounds, including particulate matter (PM), nitrous oxides (NO x ), hydrocarbons (HC), CO and SO2. There may be as many as 14 different harmful compounds in the PM exhaust fraction and carcinogenic pollutants can also be formed from atmospheric photochemical reactions in which NO x can be converted to surface O3 and peroxides. In addition, NOx conâ€� tributes to the formation of acid rain, while HC and CO are both potential health hazards. As a result of these harmful exhaust components, as the number of diesel vehicles continues to inâ€� crease, the associated increase in exhaust emissions has beâ€� come a threat to the health of both humans and the environâ€� ment [1,2]. * Corresponding author.

DOI: 10.1016/S1872â€�2067(12)60545â€�2 | http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/18722067 | Chin. J. Catal., Vol. 34, No. 4, April 2013 CHEN Yongdong et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 667â€“673 Â There are two general approaches to the reduction of harmful diesel emissions: inâ€�engine and outâ€�ofâ€�engine treatâ€� ments. The outâ€�ofâ€�engine treatments have thus far been faâ€� voured, because they are typically more convenient and less costly, and include diesel oxidation catalysts (DOCs), diesel particulate filtration (DPF), NO x selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and fourâ€�way catalysts (FWCs). These technologies can be used together or singly depending on the composition of the diesel exhaust and the regulatory requirements which must be satisfied [3]. DOCs are primarily used to remove HC, CO and the soluble organic fraction (SOF) of the PM [4]. These same cataâ€� lysts, however, can oxidize SO2 contained in the exhaust to SO3, which will subsequently react with moisture to produce either sulfurous or sulfuric acid, which in turn will deactivate the catâ€� alyst and thus increase PM emissions [5,6]. Because the quality of the diesel fuel available in China is generally poor [7,8], such that 87% of these fuels have SO2 concentrations in excess of 0.035%, the exhaust of diesel engines operating in China will typically have levels of SO2. As a result, DOCs used in China must be both highly active and highly selective, with high cataâ€� lytic activities for the destruction of CO, HC and SOF, but low activity in terms of SO2 oxidation. At present, DOC technology is most advanced in Europe, the United States and Japan, and research and development conâ€� cerning this technology is primarily performed by a small number of multiâ€�national corporations, including Engelhard in the United States, Johnson Matthey in the United Kingdom, Umicore in Belgium and BASF in Germany. In a typical DOC, a precious metal such as Pt or Pd is the active component and is loaded on the surface of a support material. The particular acâ€� tive component and support material employed in making the catalyst, as well as the working conditions of the engine, the sulfur content of the fuel and the rate of exhaust flow are the main factors which influence the efficiency of the DOC. Initially, DOC technology was based on the use of Pt loaded on an alumina support. As emissions regulations became more stringent, however, both oxidation activity towards the SOF at low temperatures and reduced oxidation of SO2 became necesâ€� sary aspects of DOC technology, and ceriumâ€�based catalysts which enabled the low temperature oxidation of the SOF beâ€� came common, along with composite supports made from maâ€� terials such as SiO2, TiO2 and ZrO2, because these substances exhibit low SO2 adsorption. In addition, DOCs incorporating molecular sieves were developed, to improve the oxidation of HC, CO and the SOF under cold start conditions. Considering all the above developments in catalyst composition, as well as other improvements in the preparation processes, the current state of DOC technology has become quite complex [9â€“11]. In the study reported herein, a new type of highâ€�performance diesel oxidation catalyst was prepared and its performance investigated using a domestic IV YC4Fâ€�type diesel engine. The results show that treatment by the new catâ€� alyst allows the engine exhaust to meet the HC and CO emission requirements of the Euro V standards. In addition, the catalyst exhibits high oxidation activity towards the SOF and low oxidaâ€� tion activity with regard to SO2. High performance DOCs developed in recent years have been primarily based on three components [12,13]: ceriaâ€�based materials, Ptâ€�loaded sulfurâ€�tolerant supports and molecular sieves. The oxygen storage material investigated in this work, Ce0.75Zr0.25O2â€�Al2O3 (3:1 mass ratio of Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 to Al2O3), was prepared using a coâ€�precipitation technique. In this methâ€� od, zirconyl carbonate is first dissolved in an appropriate quanâ€� tity of concentrated nitric acid, following which aqueous soluâ€� tions of Ce(NO3)3Â·6H2O and Al(NO3)3Â·9H2O are added in the appropriate stoichiometric ratios. Subsequently, H2O2 is added and the solution is stirred for 30 min, after which the reaction product is removed from solution by coâ€�precipitation resulting from the addition of an ammonia/ammonium carbonate soluâ€� tion. Following coâ€�precipitation, the solution is subjected to sequential heat treatment, stirring, washing and filtration. The precipitate is dried at 70 Â°C for 24 h and then calcined at 600 Â°C for 5 h to produce the final product. The composite support material Ti0.9Zr0.1O2 is also prepared using essentially the same coâ€�precipitation method as above. Zirconyl carbonate is disâ€� solved in an appropriate quantity of concentrated nitric acid and an aqueous solution of titanyl sulfate is mixed in, after which the solution is coâ€�precipitated with ammoâ€� nia/ammonium carbonate solution. After coâ€�precipitation, the solution obtained is subjected to heat treatment, stirring, washing and filtration, and the precipitate is dried at 70 Â°C for 24 h and then calcined at 550 Â°C for 5 h to obtain the composite oxide. Lastly, the Crâ€�modified Î² molecular sieves are prepared by equivalentâ€�volume impregnation, involving the impregnaâ€� tion of Î²â€�molecular sieves (Si/Al = 25) with the necessary quantity of chromium nitrate solution. The resulting product is dried at 110 Â°C for 6 h and calcined at 550 Â°C for 5 h to obtain Crâ€�Î² molecular sieve powder (1 wt% Cr). Nitrogen adsorption testing using a QUADRASORB SI autoâ€� mated surface area and pore size analyser (Quantachrome Inâ€� struments, USA) was employed to characterize the textures of the synthesized materials. In addition, an oxygen storage caâ€� pacity (OSC) measurement device was used to determine the OSC of the materials at 200 Â°C. The results of both series of tests are presented in Table 1, where it can be seen that Ce0.75Zr0.25O2â€�Al2O3 exhibits a large specific surface area and excellent low temperature OSC, a capability which facilitates the removal of the SOF [14]. According to some reports, both TiO2 and ZrO2 have only limited capacities for SO2 adsorption [15,16], and therefore using composite oxides composed of Ti and Zrâ€�based materials as DOC support materials is anticipated to inhibit the adsorpâ€� tion of SO2 by the catalyst and accordingly reduce the oxidation of SO2 over the Pt component, increasing the catalystâ€™s reâ€� sistance to the deleterious effects of sulfur in diesel fuel. Both TiO2 and ZrO2, however, have relatively low specific surface areas, and thus are not suitable for application as support maâ€� Table 1 Textural properties and OSC of catalyst samples.

In contrast, the specific surâ€� face area of Ti0.9Zr0.1O2, the composite oxide prepared in this work, is measured at 94 m 2 /g, suggesting that it is a viable canâ€� didate for use an acidic support for Pt. As well, the combination of Pt with Ti0.9Zr0.1O2, when used for the removal of HC and CO, has been shown to simultaneously exhibit both excellent cataâ€� lytic activity and sulfur resistance [8]. Î² molecular sieves are primarily used for the adsorption of HC at low temperatures, which improves catalytic efficiency during diesel engine cold starts. As the data in Table 1 show, the surface area and pore volume of the Crâ€�modified sieves are essentially unchanged by the modification process. Previous studies have demonstrated that the surface acidity of Î² molecular sieves is enhanced after the sieves are modified by the addition of Cr [18,19]. Because increased acidity in these materials tends to inhibit SO2 adsorpâ€� tion, the modification of Î² molecular sieves by Cr addition tends to result in reduced SO2 oxidation by the DOC. Therefore, the above three materials are all well suited to form the compoâ€� nents of an oxidation catalyst meant for purifying diesel exâ€� haust. The catalyst investigated in this work was prepared by an equivalentâ€�volume impregnation method. Ce0.75Zr0.25O2â€�Al2O3 and Ti0.9Zr0.1O2 were impregnated with aqueous solutions of H2PtCl6, after which they were dried and calcined at 550 Â°C for 5 h to obtain catalytic material in the form of a powder. This powder was then mixed with the Crâ€�Î² molecular sieves, added to an appropriate quantity of water, and made into a slurry by ballâ€�milling of the aqueous dispersion. Cordierite honeyâ€� comb ceramic substrates (400 cpsi, Corning, USA) were imâ€� mersed in this slurry then withdrawn, following which excess slurry on the substrates was removed using a stream of comâ€� pressed air. The substrates were subsequently dried and calâ€� cined at 550 Â°C for 5 h to produce the finished catalyst test specimens. The measured Pt, Ti0.9Zr0.1O2, Ce0.75Zr0.25O2â€�Al2O3 and Crâ€�modified Î² molecular sieve contents in the final catalyst samples were 1, 72.6, 36.3, and 12.1 g/L, respectively. Artifiâ€� cially aged catalyst specimens were obtained by placing freshly prepared catalyst samples in a tube furnace and heat treating the material at 750 Â°C for 30 h in a N2 atmosphere containing 0.02% SO2, 10% O2 and 10% H2O. Catalytic activity was measured using a continuous flow miâ€� croâ€�reactor. A mixture of CO (0.112%), C2H4 (0.056%), NO (0.07%), SO2 (0.02%), CO2 (6%), O2 (10%) and H2O (10%), with the balance being N2, at a space velocity of 30000 h â€“1 , was used to simulate the exhaust output of a diesel vehicle. The temperature of diesel exhaust is normally in the range of 200 to 400 Â°C, and the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 is constrained by therâ€� modynamic effects, such that the oxidation reaction rate generâ€� ally decreases above 450 Â°C [20]. For this reason, an infrared analyser was used to follow the conversion of SO2 at 350 Â°C to evaluate the inhibition of the oxidation reaction, because a low SO2 conversion rate is correlated with increased inhibition of the catalytic oxidation process. Variations in CO concentration over the course of the catalytic reaction were evaluated with an FGAâ€�4100 automobile exhaust gas analyser (Foshan Analytical Instrument Co., Ltd.), while a GCâ€�2001 gas chromatograph inâ€� corporating a Porapak T column and a flame ionization detecâ€� tor was employed to measure changes in HC concentration. The results of the catalytic activity trials are listed in Fig. 1 and Taâ€� ble 2, in which T50 is the lightâ€�off temperature (the temperature at which 50% conversion is achieved), T90 is the total converâ€� sion temperature (at 90% conversion) and Î”T1= T90 â€“ T50. Prior studies of domestic IV YC4Fâ€�type diesel engines with DOC have shown that the SOF primarily originates from engine lubricating oil, as well as from small amounts of unburned dieâ€� sel fuel [21]. In many studies, lubricating oil is accordingly used as a substitute for the SOF, and the catalytic and oxidative proâ€� cesses in the DOC are simulated by thermogravimeâ€� tryâ€�differential thermal analysis (TGâ€�DTA) [14,22]. In our work, diesel lubricating oil uniformly distributed on the catalyst powder was also used to simulate the SOF, applying an oil to catalyst mass ratio of 1:10, and the TGâ€�DTA method was emâ€� ployed to determine the extent of SOF conversion. TGâ€�DTA analyses were performed using a HCTâ€�2 thermogravimetric analyser (Beijing Scientific Instrument Factory, China), under air at a flow velocity of 40 ml/min and at a heating rate of 10 Â°C/min. The TGâ€�DTA plots obtained for the catalytic oxidation of SOF on both fresh and aged catalysts are shown in Fig. 2, while the catalytic activity results calculated from these plots are presented in Table 3, where T i is the temperature at which SOF conversion begins, Tm is the temperature at which the highest rate of mass loss is observed, T f is the temperature at which the reaction ends and Î”T2 = Tf â€�Ti.

The relative exothermic peak area [Î¼VÂ·Â°C/mgoil] is obtained by dividing the peak area by the mass of lubricating oil applied to the catalyst, and this value is further divided by the total mass of the test sample to give the standâ€� ardized exothermic peak area, A Î¼VÂ·Â°C/(mgoilÂ·mgsample). Acâ€� cording to research by Zhang et al. [14], a large standardized exothermic peak area is associated with a reduced probability that the lubricating oil will be volatilised, meaning that catalytic combustion is more likely and the overall catalytic effect is greater. The durability of DOCs is another important factor used to evaluate their performance. According to research by Andersâ€� son et al. [23], treating a catalyst by hydrothermal aging at 670 Â°C for 15 h, followed by heating at 250 Â°C for 15 h in 0.005% SO2, simulates an aged catalyst which has been used in a diesel vehicle with exhaust gas containing 0.001% S over a distance of 160000 km. These aging conditioning can therefore be reaâ€� sonably applied as suitable parameters when evaluating DOCs in the laboratory. However, because the diesel fuel commonly used in China typically has very high sulfur content, more deâ€� manding ageing conditions are appropriate and so, in this work, catalysts were evaluated using a N2 atmosphere containâ€� ing 0.02% SO2, 10% O2 and 10% H2O at 750 Â°C for 30 h. The activities of both the aged and unaged catalyst are summarized in Fig. 1 and Table 2. The T50 values of the fresh catalyst with regard to the oxidation of CO and C2H4 are 192 and 203 Â°C, respectively, and its T90 values are 203 and 224 Â°C. These results demonstrate that the catalyst exhibits high activâ€� ity at relatively low temperatures, such that its activity will increase rapidly after engine ignition, allowing complete conâ€� version of the exhaust. In the case of the aged catalyst, the T50 values for CO and C2H4 are 224 and 229 Â°C, and the T90 values are 235 and 241 Â°C, respectively. Compared with the fresh catalyst, these values indicate relatively little increase in either T90 or T50, and thus complete conversion can still be rapidly achieved after ignition. These results indicate that the catalyst possesses both high catalytic activity and excellent aging resistance. The conversion of SO2 to SO3 over the catalyst at 350 Â°C was also investigated, and the results show that these conversions are 22.5% for the fresh material and 13.2% for the aged cataâ€� lyst. As noted above, DOCs can also be used to remove the SOF in the exhaust of diesel vehicles, and the results concerning the catalytic conversion of the SOF over fresh and aged catalyst are presented in Table 3. The standardized exothermic peak areas in this table show the catalyst exhibits greatly improved activiâ€� ty for the catalytic combustion of the SOF at significantly deâ€� creased temperatures. The data show that the catalyst may begin to convert SOF at temperatures as low as 140 Â°C and also that the catalyst exhibits generally high performance. The test results obtained using the diesel oxidation catalyst in a domestic IV YC4Fâ€�type diesel engine are presented in Table 4. Comparison of these data with the Euro V emission standard shows that 99% CO conversion is achieved, resulting in a CO level approximately 1000 times lower than the Euro V emission standard, and almost 100% conversion of C2H4 is achieved, equal to a level about 100 times lower than the Euro V standâ€� ard. The excellent catalytic properties exhibited by this catalyst are closely associated with the higher specific surface of the support material and the outstanding oxygen storage perforâ€� mance of the ceriaâ€�zirconia alumina material. As a result, the oxidation catalyst prepared in this study possesses both high activity and high selectivity, and its application in diesel enâ€� gines will allow exhaust emissions of vehicles in China to meet higher standards. -2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 TG DTG DTA D T A ( ï�­ V ) Aged 0 100 200 300 400 500 -0.007 -0.006 -0.005 -0.004 -0.003 -0.002 -0.001 0.000 0.001 D T G ( m g / m i n ) T/ o C 90 92 94 96 98 100 T G ( % ) -0.004 -0.003 -0.002 -0.001 0.000 0.001 D T G ( m g / m i n ) Fresh DTG TG 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 90 92 94 96 98 100 T G ( % ) T/ o C -5 0 5 10 15 20 25 D T A ( ï�­ V ) DTA Fig. 2.

Tel/Fax: +86-28-83032863 # Corresponding author. Tel/Fax: +86-28-85418451 A diesel oxidation catalyst was prepared from several high performance materials: the new rare earth oxygen storage compound Ce0.75Zr0.25O2-Al2O3, the composite oxide Ti0.9Zr0.1O2 and chromium-modified ß molecular sieve. These component materials were characterized and used to prepare a Pt-based catalyst designed to reduce diesel engine exhaust emissions. The results of low temperature N2 adsorption-desorption and oxygen storage capacity tests demonstrated that Ce0.75Zr0.25O2-Al2O3 exhibits a large specific surface area and excellent oxygen storage capacity, and that Ti0.9Zr0.1O2 exhibits superior textural properties. Evaluations of catalytic activity showed that the catalyst prepared from these materials has reduced capacity for the oxidation of SO2 but high catalytic activity towards the oxidation of hydrocarbons (HC) and CO, and is also able to convert the exhaust soluble organic fraction at temperatures as low as 140 °C. Tests using a domestic YC4F-type diesel engine found that exhaust treated by the catalyst prepared in this research is capable of meeting the HC and CO emission requirements of the Euro V standard. 摘要 制备了具有高性能的稀土储氧材料Ce0.75Zr0.25O2-Al2O3, 14;Ti0.9Zr0.1O2复合材料和Cr改性的β分子筛(Cr-β分子筛), 14;并以此制备了单Pt型柴油车尾气净化氧化型催化剂. 低温N2吸附-脱附、储氧量测试结果表明, 14;Ce0.75Zr0.25O2-Al2O3样品具有较大的比表面积和优异的储氧性能, 14;Ti0.9Zr0.1O2复合材料也具有优越的织构性能. 催化剂对HC和CO具有较高的催化活性, 14;可使SOF在140 °C开始转化, 14;且具有较低的SO2氧化活性. 在YC4F国Ⅳ柴油机的测试结果表明, 14;经该催化剂处理后的尾气排放能够满足欧Ⅴ排放标准对HC和CO排放要求.
