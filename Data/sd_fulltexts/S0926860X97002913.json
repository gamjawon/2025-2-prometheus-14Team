China Received 27 March 1997: received in revised form 23 July 1997: accepted 22 August 1997 Abstract Addition of small amount of trivalent-metal oxides, Cr20~ and La203, to a Ni-Mg-O (Ni/Mg= 1/1, mol/mol) catalyst for partial oxidation of methane (POM) and CO2-reforming of methane (MCR) reactions has been found to improve the pertbrmance of the catalyst for coking-resistance. The POM operation at 1053 K for 50 h, or the MCR operation at 1100 K for 6 h, did not leave any detectable amount of carbon deposit on the surface of the catalyst. Studies of XRD, XPS, and H2-TPR spectroscopies showed that the doping of small amounts of Cr3 f and La3- to the Ni-Mg-O system led to the formation of a host-dopant-type Ni-Mg-Cr-La--O solid solution, with a considerable number of Schottky defects in the form of cationic vacancies. An increase in the degree of disorder in the solid solution due to Cr203 and La203 dissolved in Ni~Mg~_~O lattice would be expected to enhance the mobility of the lattice oxygen anions. This would be in favor of speeding up the reaction between the carbon-containing species and reactive oxygen species via migration of the lattice 02- so as to inhibit the deposition of carbon on the surface of the catalyst. On the other hand, part of the Schottky defects in the form of cationic vacancies may diffuse to the surface, where Ni\"-species can be well accommodated and stabilized, thus, forming a rich-in-Ni (with mixed valence states) surface layer. As a result, the proportion of the reducible Ni-species was pronouncedly increased, but the temperature for their reduction was considerably raised, so that the surface Ni-species were maintained with higher possibility in positive valence states under POM and MCR reaction conditions. This would, to some extent, lead to the reduction of the rate of deep dehydrogenation of methane to carbon, therefore tending to reduce, if not avoid, coking caused by an excess of carbon on the surface. :(\", 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction The catalytic partial oxidation of methane (POM) and the CO2-reforming of methane (MCR) to syngas have drawn much attention in recent years *Corresponding author. Fax: +86 592 2086116; e-mail: hbzhang@xmu.edu.cn [1], because the former has potential significance as an alternative to the conventional steam reform- ing of methane, while the latter consumes CH4 and CO2, both of which are greenhouse gases. Utilization of these two processes is of economic and environ- mental benefit. Studies on the mechanisms of these two reactions and development of highly efficient catalysts are among the hot topics in the literature [l-101. 0926-860X/98/$19.00 .i~\" 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Chert et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 166 (1998) 343-350 British researchers first reported that several noble metal catalysts in the form of supported or mixed oxides were very effective catalysts for POM and MCR reactions [21; later, Choudhary et al. [4] and Hatakawa et al. 17] reported that some Ni- and Co-based catalysts can also carry out POM or MCR reaction successfully. In practice, Ni-based catalysts are believed to be more promising than noble metal-based catalysts. Later experiments, however, showed [4.11,121 that almost all kinds of Ni catalysts, e.g. Ni-Ln203, Ni/MO, (M=AI, Si, Zr, etc.), Ni-Mg-O, etc., suffered more or less from the disadvantage of serious deactivation caused by fouling of coke lbrmed in the processes of POM and MCR, especially under rich-in-CH4 and poor-in- oxidant conditions. Therefore, the development of coking-resistant non-noble metal catalysts has potential significance to commercial utilization of POM and MCR processes. In the present work, a 4-component Ni-based catalyst, Ni-Mg-Cr-La-O, was developed and studied. In addition to the high activity and stability of both POM and MCR reactions, this catalyst displayed excellent performance in coking-resistance, even under the reaction conditions of CH4/O2=2.1/ l(v/v) for POM, and of CH4/CO2=I/1.08(v/v) for MCR. XRD, XPS and TPR methods were employed in the characteristic studies on the structure and properties of the catalyst. The results provide useful implications about the nature of the promoter behavior. with the molar ratios of Ni/Mg, Ni/Ca and Ni/La all at I/1. 2.2. Evaluation ~'catalvst activity Evaluation of the catalyst activity was carried out in a fixed-bed continuous flow reactor-GC combination system operating under atmospheric pressure. The reactor is made of a quartz tube of 5.0 mm I.D.. The temperature was controlled by an XCC-1000 programmed-temperature controller. A 24mg of catalyst sample was used each time for testing. The sample of catalyst was first pre-reduced by using a flow of purified H2 following a temperature programmed procedure of 40 min from room temperature to 973 K, and then a pre-mixed feed- gas was introduced into the reactor at the desired temperature. The catalytic POM and MCR reactions over the catalysts were carried out at a stationary state and under the following reaction conditions: 1053 K, a feedstream of mixture of 2.1CH4/102 (v/v) with a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) at i.710s ml(STP)/h-g catal, for POM reaction; and 1053 K, 1CH4/1.08CO2, GHSV at 6 104 ml(STP)/h-g catal, for MCR reaction. Activity data were taken after 30 min of operation, when a stationary state activity appeared. The gaseous reactants and products were analyzed by using an on-line SQ-206 GC equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TC) and a 601# carbon molecular sieve column, with helium as a carrier gas. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation of catalyst The catalyst was prepared by thoroughly mixing Ni(NO3)2.6H20, Mg(NO3)e.6H20, Cr(NO3)3.10H20 and La(NO3)3-nH20 (n<6) (all in A.R. grade of purity) with a molar ratio of Ni/Mg/Cr/La=9/9/l/1, and then by adding a certain amount of de-ionized water to form a homogeneous solution. The solution was dried in vacuum at 373 K, and then calcined in air at 1073 K for 5 h. A porous catalyst precursor with a BET area of 80 m2/g was obtained. The home-made Ni-Mg-O, Ni-Ca-O and Ni-La-O catalysts were prepared by the same procedure as described above. 2.3. Characterization of catalyst Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) of cata- lyst was conducted on a fixed-bed continuous flow reactor-GC combination system. A N2-carried 5v% H2 gaseous mixture was used as reducing gas: the rate ot\" elevating temperature was 10 K/rain.; an amount of catalyst equivalent to the content of 0.1 mmol Ni was used each time for testing. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were taken by using a Rigaku D/Max-C X-ray diffractometer with CuK, radiation at a scanning rate of 6 C/min. XPS measurements were done on a VG ESCA LAB MK-2 machine with All(,, radiation (1487 eV) and UHV (1 l0-7 Pa), calibrated inter- nally by the carbon deposit C(ls) (B.E.) at 284.6 eV. The amount of coke was measured by a PCT-I TG- P. Chen et al./Applied Catalysis A.\" DTA analyzer, with the temperature elevated at a rate of 20 K/min. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Pe~. brmance of catalyst for POM and MCR The activities of the Ni-Mg-Cr-La-O catalyst and the two binary Ni-based catalysts, Ni-Mg-O and Ni- La-O, /'or POM and MCR reactions, were tested at 1053 K. The results (shown in Table 1 and Fig. I) indicated that this 4-component catalyst displayed General 166 (1998) 343-350 345 high activities as compared to those of the Ni-Mg- O and Ni-La-O catalysts [9], with conversion of methane (Xcm) of 89% and selectivity of 96C% to CO (Sco, calculated on the carbon number basis) for POM reaction, and Xcm of 88% and conversion of CO2 (Xco2) of 86% for MCR, respectively. Fig. 2(a and b) illustrate the results of stability testing of the Ni-Mg-Cr-La-O catalyst during 50 h of POM and 8 h of MCR operations, respectively.

Ni-La-O catalysts, after conducting POM or MCR reaction for a certain period of time, were measured by a TG-DTA analyzer. The results are summarized in Table 2. For the MCR reaction, the amounts of coke detected on the Ni-Mg-O and Ni-La--O catalysts reached up to 12 and 10.2 wt% of the catalyst used, respectively, after 1 h of operation at 1053 K. On the Ni-Mg-Cr-La-O catalyst, only an amount of coke equivalent to 7 wt% of the catalyst used was detected after 8 h of operation at 1053 K; on elevating the temperature to 1100 K, no coke was detected after 6 h of operation. For the POM reaction, the coking- resistant performance of the Ni-Mg-Cr-La-O cata- lyst is more pronounced: the operation in 50 h under the reaction conditions of 1053 K and 2. ICH4/102 did not leave any detectable amount of carbon deposit on the catalyst, whereas, as a sharp contrast, on the Ni- Mg-O and Ni-La-O, considerable amounts of coke had been formed in a much shorter period of time for testing under the same conditions. These results demonstrate that the 4-component Ni-Mg-Cr-La-O catalyst not only retains high activities and selectiv- ities for both POM and MCR reactions, but also possesses remarkable coking-resistance. 3.2. Spectroscopic characterization of catalyst Fig. 3 shows the results of XRD measurements of several catalysts. It is well known that crystal struc- tures of both NiO and MgO belong to the 'NaCI' lattice-type. Since Ni2+ and Mg2+ have the same valence and quite close ionic radius values P.

I0.070 nm for r(Ni2 ~ ) and 0.065 nm for r(Mg2\" )], the dimensions of their crystal cells are very close to each other. Thus, the NiO and MgO components in the Ni- Mg-O system would easily form a NixMg~_xO solid solution due to excellent mutual solubility between them, as evidenced by the XRD pattern of the Ni-Mg- O system. In Fig. 3(a), only the diffraction peaks assigned to a NixMgl_xO solid-solution phase appeared; no peak ascribed to either discrete NiO or discrete MgO phase was observed. In the XRD pattern for the Ni-Mg-O catalyst in the functioning state (shown in Fig. 3(e)), the weak features of metal- lic Ni-phase and strong peaks of the Ni~Mg~_xO phase were observed, indicating that only a small proportion of the Ni2- component was reduced to Niand the remaining large proportion of the Ni2 ~ remained in the phase of the NixMgj_xO solid solution. The high stability of the solid-solution phase of the NixMgl .~O could also be demonstrated through the following comparative testing. On a functioning Ni- Ca-O (Ni/Ca=l/l, mol/mol) catalyst undergoing POM operation at 1053 K for 30 min, only the dif- fraction peaks ascribed to metallic Ni-phase and CaO phase were observed, whereas the intensities of the features for NiO-phase were below the detectable limit (Fig. 3(h) vs. Fig. 3(d)). This indicated that almost all Ni2+ component had been reduced to Ni with a developed metallic Ni-phase. The reducible behavior of the Ni-La-O system (Ni/La=l/l, mol/mol) is similar. After undergoing the same pre-reduction treatment and reaction, the original LaNiO3 composite oxide phase with ABO3-type structure in the oxidation state was disintegrated, and the two discrete phases, metallic Ni and La203, were tbrmed. However, for the Ni-Mg-O (Ni/Mg= 1/1, mol/mol) system undergoing the same treatment, only a small proportion of the Ni2+, perhaps located at the surface layer, was reduced to Ni The remaining large proportion of the Ni2+ could not be reduced, probably due to the strong valence stabilization of the crystal field of Ni,Mgj--xO with 'NaCl'-type structure, and remained in the phase of NixMg~_xO solid solution. Addition of a small amount of trivalent-metai oxi- des, Cr203 and La203, to the Ni-Mg--O catalyst did not lead to disintegration of the Ni~Mgl .~O solid- solution phase, but rather formed a host-dopant solid solution of the Ni-Mg-Cr-La-O, as evidenced by the XRD patterns (Fig. 3(b and c)), where no discrete phases, i.e. NiO, MgO, Cr20~, or La203, was observed. Solution of an amount of Cr3 ~- Ir(Cr3+)=0.064 nml in the NixMgl_,O lattice would result in the formation of cationic vacancies. Solution of La3+ in the N%,Mgl_ ~O lattice is expected to be relatively difficult in comparison with that ofCr-~- due to its larger ionic radius [r(La3*)=0.106 nml, and, thus, most of the La3+ would be dispersed on the surface of the Ni~Mgl-tO crystallites. As a result, the doping of both Cr3- and La3' in the Ni.,.Mgl_,O system would lead to the decrease in the degree of long-range order in the solid-solution lattice, as sup- ported by the broadening of the XRD peaks observed (Fig. 3(b and c)). Conceivably, an increase in the degree of disorder in the solid solution due to Cr203 and La203 dissolved in Ni~Mgl _.,O lattice would enhance the mobility of the lattice oxygen anions. This would be in favor of improving the transport of the reactive oxygen-species via the migration of lattice 02-, and, thus, favor the 348 P Chen et al./Applied Catalysis A.\" General 166 (1998) 343-350 speeding up of the surface reaction between the carbon-containing species and reactive oxygen spe- cies so as to inhibit the deposition of carbon on the surface of catalyst. On the other hand, part of Schottky defects in the form of cationic vacancies will diffuse to the surface of NixMgl_xO phase, where Ni--species can be well accommodated and stabilized, thus form- ing a rich-in-Ni (with mixed valence states) surface layer of-(Nix)--O2 -Mg2\" -02-- to achieve valence and charge compensation for subsurface layers of- M3+-O2--Mg2 ~--O2--. As a result, the proportion of the reducible Ni-species was pronouncedly increased, but their deep reduction to Niseemed to be somewhat difficult due to the strong valence stabilization of the crystal field of Ni,Mgt_.~O. This can gain some experimental support from the XRD and XPS obser- vations. As shown in Fig. 3(g), the diffraction peaks of metallic Ni in the XRD pattern of the functioning Ni- Mg-Cr-La-O catalyst were pronouncedly enhanced in their intensities, but broadened in the shapes, in comparison with those of the undoped Ni-Mg-O catalyst. The results of XPS measurements on the Ni-Mg-Cr-La-O catalyst indicated that the addition of a small amount of Cr203 and La203 to the Ni-Mg- O catalyst precursor shifted the Ni(2p) electron bind- ing-energy from 854.9 to 856.0 eV (Fig. 4(a and b)), and that there coexisted some Ni-species with mixed valence states (Nit), Ni~ and Ni2~) on the surface of the functioning Ni-Mg-Cr-La-O catalyst, with a considerable proportion of Ni in Ni+ (Fig. 4(c)). H2-temperature programmed reduction (TPR) of the catalyst precursors provided useful information about reducibility of the Ni-component in these cat- alysts. As shown in Fig. 5(b), two peaks (673.900 K) were observed on the Ni-Mg-O catalyst, which may be reasonably assigned to the reduction of the redu- cible Ni2\"--species; tentatively, the 673 K peak was due to Ni2+---,Ni+, and the 900 K due to Ni+---,Ni On the Ni-Mg-Cr-La-O, a strong peak at 718 K with two shoulder peaks at 618 and 683 K, respectively, and another strong peak at 1123 K and another distinct shoulder peak at 1000 K were observed (Fig. 5(c)). It is known that La3+ and Mg2+ are nonreducible under the reaction conditions for POM and MCR. The H2- TPR spectrum taken on a related system, Cr-Mg-O (Cr/Mg=l/I, mol/mol) (Fig. 5(a)) demonstrated that reduction of a small amount of the Cr3~ to its lower valence state may occur.

Thus, the two shoulder-peaks at 618 and 683 K may be assigned to the reduction of Cr3\" -species; and the 718 K peak and the I(X)OK shoulder-peak may be due to Ni2-~Ni' and Ni~ ~Ni respectively; and the 1123 K peak might mainly originate from the reduc- tion of the Ni\"\" -species, newly separated from the Ni- Mg-Cr-La-O solid-solution phase under the high temperature. Therefore, by comparison of the H2- TPR spectra of these systems, it could be concluded that, on one hand, the doping of a small amount of Cr3~ and La3~ brought about an increase in the amount of reducible Ni2 \"-species in comparison with the undoped Ni-Mg-O system, and on the other hand, it resulted in a pronounced raise in the reduction temperature for the Ni2+-species, in agreement with an increase in the binding energy of electrons of the Ni2 ~, revealed by the XPS spectra of Ni(2p) (Fig. 4(a and b)). As a result, the reduction of these reducible Ni2\"-species would be relatively difficult and some- what large proportion of the Ni-species could be stabilized at a positive valence state, as evidenced by the XPS result shown in Fig. 4(c). This is obviously different from the case of the Ni-La-O, in which all the Ni2- could be reduced to metallic Ni-state at much lower temperatures, with three H2-TPR peaks observed correspondingly (Fig. 5(d)). Our previous comparative study on the catalytic behavior of the first series of transition metals (includ- ing Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, etc.) lor the POM reaction has led to the following conclusions [10]: the POM activity is related to the valence-changeable transition- metal sites. MMn+ (e.g. NiNi2-), on the surface of the functioning catalysts; the transition-metal sites in zero-valence state seem to be responsible for the activation and dehydrogenation of methane by homo- lytic splitting of its C-H bonds on these sites, and a changeable valence of the active sites is required for the activation and rapid conversion of dioxygen. Therefore, it seems to us that one of roles that the doping of Cr3' and La3~ plays is to generate a considerable number of Schottky defects in the form of cationic vacancies, which will diffuse to the surface of the catalyst, and. thus, provide favorable micro-environments for accommodating and main- taining the surface Ni-species with higher possibility in positive valence states under POM and MCR reaction conditions. This would, to a certain extent, lead to reducing the rate of deep dehydrogenation of methane to carbon and therefore would tend to reduce, if not avoid, coking caused by an excess of carbon on the surface. 4. Conclusions Addition of a small amount of trivalent-metal oxi- des, Cr203 and La203 to the Ni-Mg-O (Ni/Mg=l/l, mol/mol) catalyst tbr POM and MCR reactions has been found to remarkedly improve the performance of the catalyst fbr coking-resistance. The XRD measurements indicated that the doping of the small amount ofCr3- and La3 ~ to the Ni-Mg-O system led to the formation of a host-dopant-type Ni- Mg-Cr-La-O solid solution, with a considerable number of Schottky defects in the t'orm of cationic vacancies. The XPS observation provided evidence that there coexisted the Ni-species with mixed valence states (Nit), Ni' and Ni2-. with a somewhat large proportion in Ni') on the surface of the functioning Ni-Mg-Cr-La-O catalyst. The H2-TPR testing showed that the doping of a small amount of Cr3\" and La3+ brought about an increase in the amount of reducible NiZf-species in comparison with the undoped Ni-Mg-O system, and on the other hand, 350 P Chen et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 166 (19981 343-350 it resulted in a pronounced rise in their reduction temperature. The above experimental results may lead to the following inferences: the doping of a small amount of Cr3+ and La34- on one hand, resulted in an increase in the degree of disorder in the solid solution, which would be in favor of enhancing the mobility of the lattice 02 -, and thus speeding up the surface oxidation reactions; on the other hand, it also led to the forma- tion ofa rich-in-Ni (with mixed valence states) surface layer, where the surface Ni-species were maintained with higher possibility in positive valence states so that deep dehydrogenation of methane to carbon was inhibited to some extent. It is these factors that are closely related to the excellent performance of the catalyst for coking-resistance.
