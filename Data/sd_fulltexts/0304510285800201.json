Poincare, 13397 Marseilles Cedex 13 (France) (Received February 9, 1984) Summary The hydridic tri-iron and tri-osmium cluster anions [HM3(CO)ll]- (M = Fe, Os) have been employed as soluble and supported catalysts for the hydroformylation of 1-hexene. Hydroformylation and isomerization of the alkene occurred simultaneously with both clusters. In the case of iron the integrity of the cluster was not retained, and for this reason it seems likely that several complexes are involved in the catalytic reaction. In the case of osmium, decomposition was observed for the unsupported system whereas the supported cluster anion could be recovered almost quantitatively under anhydrous conditions. High normal to branched heptanal ratios were obtained with this system. Introduction Supported metal clusters could be useful catalysts or catalyst precursors because they offer an intermediate nuclearity between mononuclear transi- tion metal complexes and metal aggregates [1 - 3]. Metal clusters are used as the precursors for metal aggregates formed on surfaces. In this case, the solids can be impregnated with clusters in solution and then used under con- ditions which induce breakdown of the cluster framework [4]. In contrast, intact clusters may be formed and stabilized on supports. The direct attachment of metal clusters on inorganic oxides is exemplified by the reaction of M3(CO)i2 (M = Os, Ru) with surface OH groups on silica or alumina to produce trinuclear clusters bound to the surface through an oxygen bridge [5-7]. Functionalized poly(styrene-divinylbenzene) and silica supports have also been used to support structurally unique clusters. Ligands which provide links between support and cluster are typically PPh;, NR2, SH or OH groups [8 - 10]. Recently, anionic tri-iron clusters have been * Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/85/$3.30 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 102 attached to poly(styrene-divinylbenzene) when the latter has incorporated NR3+ groups [11] or directly onto alumina [12], while anionic iron tri- osmium clusters have also been characterized on alumina [13]. Many reports on the catalytic properties of anionic clusters can be found in the literature. The tri-iron cluster [HFe3(CO)ll]- has been used as a homogeneous catalyst [14], and has also been supported on functionalized polystyrene [15] or alumina [16], giving solids which act as efficient nitro- aromatic reducing agents. Recent work has described the properties of [HRu3(CO)ll]- as a catalyst for alkene hydroformylation [17], for the hydrosilylation [18] and hydrogenation [19] of carbon dioxide, and for syngas reactions [20, 21]. We report here our results on the use of the anionic clusters [HMs^O)!!]\" (M = Fe, Os) supported on functionalized poly(styrene- divinylbenzene) as catalysts for alkene hydroformylation. Homogeneous catalysis experiments with the unsupported cluster anions have also been carried out to provide a basis for the comparison of the catalytic activity of supported and molecular species, and to determine the effects associated with the support. Experimental Catalyst preparation and characterization Purified styrene and divinylbenzene (DVB, 2 - 4 mol %) were copoly- merized according to a literature procedure [22] to produce 11 ^im thick membranes which were nearly transparent. Macroporous chloromethylated poly(styrene-DVB) beads (20 - 60 mesh) were purchased from Strem. The beads were dried under vacuum at 323 K for 24 h before use. Both solids were chloromethylated and/or aminated [22] to produce CH2 NR3 CP. The anionic tri-iron cluster [HFe3(CO)n]~ was isolated as the [NHEt3]\"1\" salt, fixed on supports and characterized according to described procedures [11]. The cluster anion ^(^(GO)!!]\" was prepared and isolated as the [NEt4]\"1\" salt according to a published method [23]; this procedure was modified to give the supported tri-osmium cluster. The soluble ammonium groups were replaced by solids (membrane or beads) incorporating VR^ groups (0.08 mmol Os3 per 0.24 mmol NR34\"). Infrared characterizations were performed using Nicolet 3000 or 7199 Fourier Transform infrared spectrometers. The FTIR technique made it possible to substract the background spectrum of the polymer from the carbonyl infrared spectra. Analyses of the solids incorporating anionic clus- ters were performed by atomic absorption (Varian AA-275). Experiments involving poly(styrene-DVB) membranes were carried out in a flow system incorporating thermostatted, atmosphere-controlled -infrared cells as described elsewhere [24]. Alkene hydroformylation The reactant 1-hexene and the solvent benzene were distilled under N2 before use. Alkene hydroformylation was performed in a thermostatted 103 batch autoclave (125 ml) stirred mechanically. The reactor was charged under a nitrogen atmosphere with [HOs3(CO)ll]-[NR4]+ (0.08 g, 0.08 mmol) or [HFe3(CO)ll^[NR4]+ (0.12 g, 0.2 mmol), respectively, 1-hexene (1 ml, 8 mmol) and benzene (10 ml). The reactor was then pressurized with HI (15 X 10s N m\"2) and CO (15 X 105 N m\"\"2) and heated and maintained at at 373 K (osmium) or 353 K (iron) for 48 h. After reaction, the mixture was allowed to cool down to room temperature. Further cooling to 253 K with dry ice/acetone was necessary prior to the release of the remaining pressure, in order to prevent any product stripping. The same procedure was used with the supported clusters. One gram of the resin containing the iron or osmium cluster was used, and the reaction time was varied between 24 h and 60 h. The same procedure was followed to test the catalytic properties of Os3(CO)i2 (0.08 mmol) or the decomposition product of [HK^^O);^ (0.08 mmol) for alkene hydroformylation. The decomposition products of [HOs3(CO)ll]- were obtained by heating the compound at 400 K for l h under a nitrogen atmosphere or by flowing air over the compound at 293 K for 3 h. Products and catalysts were separated by filtration (supported cata- lysts) or distillation (soluble catalysts). The polymers were also extracted with dichloromethane for 6 h using a Sohxiet apparatus. Analysis Product analysis was performed with a gas Chromatograph equipped with an FID detector, an electronic integrator and a stainless-steel column (3 m length, 0.0032 m diameter) packed with 20% Carbowax 20 M on Chromo sorb W. Results Tri-iron and tri-osmium carbonyl clusters were attached to poly- (styrene-DVB) supports (membrane or macroporous beads) functionalized with NR3\"1\" groups. Tri-iron clusters were supported by means of a previously described ligand-exchange reaction [11]. Supported tri-osmium clusters were obtained according to a procedure derived from that described for their soluble analogues, the soluble NR3\"1\" groups being replaced by supports con- taining NR3\"1\" groups. This procedure gave better results than a ligand- exchange reaction similar to that described for tri-iron clusters because of the low stability of [HOs3(CO)ll]~[NEt4]+ in solution. Supported anionic clusters [HM3(CO)ii]~ (M = Os, Fe) were identified by comparison of their carbonyl infrared spectra with those already known for the soluble clusters. The infrared data are summarized in Table 1. On the basis of this comparison it was possible to deduce that unique species had been fixed on the support. The analyses of Samples 3, 4, 7 and 8 (Table l) used as catalysts for 1-hexene hydroformylation are reported in Table 2. Samples 2 and 6 (Table 1) were employed to determine the chemical and thermal stability of the supported anionic species; thus, infrared spectra 104 TABLE 1 Infrared characterization of polymer-bound anionic analogues clusters and their molecular Sample No. Sample Solvent or phase Vco (cm 1) 1 [HOsa^Ohir^Nr CHzCli 2 -CH2-NEt3[HOs3(CO)n]- membrane 3,4 (g)-CH2-NEt3[HOs3(CO)ii]- beads 5 [HFe3(CO)^^[HNEt3]+ CHzCli 6 -CH2-NEt3[HFe3(CO)n]- membrane 7, 8 (P)-CH2 NEt3[HFe3(CO)ii]- beads 2081(m), 2021(s), 1996(s), 1951(m), 1667(w) 2081(w), 2021(s), 1994(s), 1952(ms), 1668(sw) 2081(w), 2021(s), 1994(s), 1952(ms) 2070(w), 2000(vs), 1972(s), 1946(m), 1718(m) 2060(w), 2000(vs), 1970(s), 1945(m), 1720(m) 2065(w), 2000(vs), 1972(s), 1944(m), 1720(m) TABLE 2 Analyses of polymers incorporating anionic clusters, CHi NR3[HM3(CO)n]~ Sample No. M N content(wt.%) M content(wt.%) Molar ratioN/M3 3,47,8 Os Fe 0.8 0.90 2.66 3.6 12.3 3 of the solids were recorded using FTIR spectroscopy to enable subtraction of the polymer sample background when the material was held in a con- trolled-atmosphere cell. No changes in the carbonyl infrared spectrum of Sample 2 (Table 1) incorporating the tri-osmium cluster was recorded at a temperature <393 K under helium. At 373 K, the band corresponding to the bridging carbonyl (1667 cm\"1) disappeared. At a temperature >353 K, cluster decomposition occurred as shown by the progressive disappearance of the carbonyl absorptions corresponding to mononuclear bands [24] and darkening of the sample. Tri-iron clusters incorporated in Sample 6 were stable at temperatures <363 K under helium. At 353 K, a progressive diminution in the intensity of the carbonyl band occurred and transmission electron microscopy of the sample after treatment at this temperature indi- cated metal aggregation [11]. The two supported anionic clusters were stable under CO and H; atmospheres at pressures of 10s N m\"2 and at temperatures below that required for thermal decomposition. Decomposition occurred when Samples 2 and 6 were exposed to oxygen. 106 Simultaneous alkene hydroformylation and isomerization was observed when a mixture of CO and H; was brought into contact with a solution of 1-hexene in benzene in the presence of each of the anionic clusters (molec- ular or supported) (Table 3). The soluble osmium species induced a higher isomerization/hydroformylation ratio than the soluble iron species, while the supported anionic species gave the same extent of conversion of 1-hexene into 2-hexene as their molecular analogues. The turnover number (defined here as the total number of moles of heptanal formed per mole of cluster) for the osmium species was low and was not affected by fixation. The selectivity to normal aldehyde was 90%. An increase in CO partial pressure (from 15 X 105 to 60 X 105 N m~2) resulted in a higher turnover number (from 2 to 4) (Table 3) in the presence of the sup- ported catalyst. The initial structure of the soluble tri-osmium cluster was not preserved when the reaction lasted for 48 h. In this case, a solid which exhibited a complex carbonyl infrared spectrum was recovered. No attempt was made to identify this complex mixture associated with decomposition of the initial cluster. To test whether any of this decomposition product was catalytically active for alkene hydroformylation, products resulting from the thermal or air decomposition of [HOs3(CO)ll]- were placed with the reactants in the autoclave under alkene hydroformylation conditions. None of these decom- position products induced hydroformylation. In contrast, the integrity of the supported osmium cluster was partially retained over a reaction period of 48 h. However, if the reaction mixture contained traces of water, two products were found on the resin. Extraction of the resin with dichloromethane after the reaction indicated the presence of Os3(CO)i2 which was identified by infrared spectroscopy, the remaining species left on the resin being the initial tri-osmium cluster. In addition, a comparison of the carbonyl infrared spectra of Sample 3 before and after its use as a catalyst in the reaction showed that the intensities of the carbonyl bands of the used catalyst were uniformly lower. Analysis of Sample 3 before and after the reaction provided a quantitative measure of metal leaching. The results of these analyses are reported in Table 4. An amount of the neutral cluster Os3(CO)i2 was also found in the solution resulting from filtration of the reaction mixture. More careful drying of both reactant and catalyst supports enabled a better recovery of the initial cluster on the support (Table 4). However, traces of water in the porous catalyst support could not be removed com- pletely, and the used catalyst always exhibited less metal content than the initial catalyst. However, the recovered catalyst could be re-used without any significant change in activity (Table 3). We conclude that metal leaching is associated with traces of water in the support, which reacts with some of the anionic cluster to produce the Os3(CO)i2 cluster both on the support and in solution. It was demonstrated that the overall osmium balance was satisfied, and that the neutral Os3(CO)i2 cluster was inactive towards alkene hydroformylation under the same experimental conditions.

From this we infer that stabilization of the species occurred on fixation. To test the possibility of hydroformylating an internal alkene, a com- mercial 2-hexene (ci's: 63.6%; frans: 35.6%) was brought into contact with CO and H; in the presence of Sample 4. Only a very small generation of isoheptanal (9% as compared to the hydroformylation of 1-hexene) occurred. Neither the decomposition products nor the neutral Os3(CO)i2 cluster (both of which may be present during the reaction) are catalysts for alkene hydroformylation. On the basis of these observations, we suggest that the anionic species [HOs3(CO)ii]~ is responsible for both hydroformylation and isomerization of the alkene. Alkene hydroformylation was also attempted in the presence of [HFe3(CO)n]~ clusters. The initial structure of the soluble iron cluster was not preserved during reaction over a period of 48 h. After a careful vacuum distillation of the reaction mixture to recover the soluble catalyst, an iron- containing solid was obtained which gave two bands in the infrared spectrum at 1958 and 1967 cm\"1, neither of which correspond to the initial cluster. The initial structure of the supported iron clusters was also not preserved during reaction over a period of 48 h. Infrared analysis of the iron-containing beads suggested the presence, amont other species, of [HFe(CO)4]~ (1907(m) and 1871(s) cm\"1; lit.: 1914 and 1880 cm\"1 [25]). None of the initial cluster was recovered and metal leaching was observed (Table 4). Clusters incorporating 3d metals such as iron have a strong propensity towards fragmentation. Literature reports indicate that Fe3(CO)i2 reacts with alkenes to generate complexes of the type [(alkene)Fe(CO),J- which activate catalytic alkene isomerization [26]. We have observed the presence of [HFe(CO)4]'' among other species which may activate alkene isomeriza- tion and hydroformylation. Furthermore, none of the initial clusters was recovered after the reaction. For these reasons we conclude that the catalytic process involved in the transformation of 1-hexene, H; and CO into 108 2-hexenes and heptanals does not utilise the initial clusters but several of the complexes produced through cluster decomposition. Discussion Alkene hydroformylation catalyzed by mononuclear complexes con- taining hydride ligands, i.e. HCo(CO)4 [27] and HRhCO(PPh3)3 [28], have been described previously. The mechanisms proposed involve alkene o-bond formation followed by a Tr-bond formation, CO insertion and a final hydro- genation which generates aldehydes. Our experimental observations agree with such a mechanism, but in the experiments studied in our work the necessary unsaturation on the cluster is created by opening the CO bridging bond as has been demonstrated by infrared spectroscopy. Literature reports indicate that carbonyl clusters, and in particular hydridocarbonyl cluster anions, can act as catalysts for alkene hydroformyla- tion [2]. Such a catalytic activity for the [HM^CO^i]\" clusters used during this work can be predicted from the presence of carbonyl and hydride bridges on the cluster frame. However, it is known that a polynuclear struc- ture is not required for alkene hydroformylation [27, 28] and that mono- metallic species created by the decomposition of the initial clusters may be responsible for the catalytic activity. Our work strongly suggests that the supported tri-osmium anion clusters are the catalytic species. Furthermore, we believe that clusters can be relevant catalysts only if they induce catalytic reactions more efficiently than mononuclear complexes. The next important question which needs to be answered is : \"Why should clusters be used instead of mononuclear complexes as catalysts for alkene hydroformylation?\" The answer might lie in the prospect of unique selectiv- ities associated with the three-dimensional structure of the clusters. High selectivities (defined here as n/(n + b), with n = molar production of n- heptanal and b = molar production of isoheptanal) have been observed in the present work with supported [HOs3(CO)ll]- species (Table 3). The relation- ship between selectivity and polynuclear structure is illustrated by the fol- lowing: the observed selectivity is lower with the soluble (and partially decomposed) species than with the supported species which retains the cluster framework. The observation of a lower selectivity brought about by higher CO pressure may be associated with competition between 1- and 2-hexene hydroformylation. At higher CO pressure a greater amount of 2-hexene is hydro formylated, thus producing isoheptanal which is responsible for the reduction in selectivity. References 1 E. L. Muetterties and M. J.

The hydridic tri-iron and tri-osmium cluster anions [HM3(CO)11]− (M = Fe, Os) have been employed as soluble and supported catalysts for the hydroformylation of 1-hexene. Hydroformylation and isomerization of the alkene occurred simultaneously with both clusters. In the case of iron the integrity of the cluster was not retained, and for this reason it seems likely that several complexes are involved in the catalytic reaction. In the case of osmium, decomposition was observed for the unsupported system whereas the supported cluster anion could be recovered almost quantitatively under anhydrous conditions. High normal to branched heptanal ratios were obtained with this system. References 1 E.L. Muetterties M.J. Krause Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. Engt. 22 1983 135 2 R. Ugo R. Sparo J. Mol.
