FRETY, B. BENAICHOUBA, P. BUSSIERE Institut de Recherches sur la Catalyse, 2 Av. Albert Einstein, 69626 Villeurbanne Cedex (France) D. SANTOS CUNHA and Y. L. LAM Institute Militar de Engenharia, Secao de Quimica, Praca Gen. Tiburcio n-80, 22290 Urea, Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) Summary Ir, Sn and Ir Sn high loading catalysts, supported on 17^203, have been studied by various techniques (DTA and TGA, Mossbauer spectroscopy, Hz and 0'i adsorption, cyclohexane conversion) in order to understand the role and state of tin in bimetallic catalysts. The results show that after reduction at 673 K the Ir Sn A^Oa cata- lyst no longer presents the properties of Ir Al^Oa. Strong mobility of the tin entities during reduction has been detected, and is thought to be responsible for the high interaction existing between Ir and Sn(0) in the final sample. Suppression of C C bond-breaking occurs through dilution of the Ir ensemble by tin. A marked decrease in the apparent activation energy for benzene formation using cyclohexene as a reactant was also observed due to the presence of tin. This fact supports the existence of a ligand effect between Ir and Sn. Introduction Tin has sometimes been added to modify the properties of Ni, Pd, Rh and Pt catalysts and, particularly in the latter case, industrial applications exist (dehydrogenation and reforming catalysts, etc.) In the case of Ni Sn and Pd Sn supported on SiO; [I], the rate of various dehydrogenation reactions (cyclohexane, cyclohexanone, 2-propanol) goes through a maximum when increasing the atomic ratio Me/Sn. On the other hand, the presence of tin results in a strong decrease in the rates of hydrogenation of ethylene and benzene as well as a decrease in the concen- tration of C residues in Ni Sn as compared with Ni. In these bimetallic cata- lysts, where CO adsorption measurements have shown surface and bulk com- positions to be similar, XPS indicated that the Pd 4d and Ni 3d peaks shift to higher energies as the Me/Sn ratios decrease; this observation supports the idea of the contribution of a ligand effect in the observed catalytic results. 0304-5102/84/$3.00 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 174 The case of Pt Sn A^Oa catalysts is far more complicated, mainly because the larger amount of literature information leads to apparent contra- dictions. Miiller et al. [2] showed that the reduction at 783 K creates a Pt Sn(II) supported system, a situation recently confirmed by Burch [3] using TPR and in line with other results [4, 5]. On the other hand, the work of Dautzenberg et al. [6] on monofunctional-supported Pt Sn, and of Volter et al. [7] sustain the idea thatJPt Sn alloys are of major importance for the properties of these catalysts. With a number of preparations, Bacaud et al. [8] concluded that for Pt Sn alloys, Sn(IV) and Sn(II) exist in various con- centrations, depending on the total and relative metal loadings. They also stated that ionic tin can modify support acidity. When Sn(II) has been detected, the catalytic modifications due to tin have been attributed to electronic effects [9, 4]; when Pt Sn alloys were present, either geometric or ligand effects were used to interpret the role of tin [6, 7]. In the majority of works, it was recognized that Sn exerts a poi- soning effect, which is more important for C C bond breaking than for C H rupture, leading, for instance, to an increase in aromatization selectivity in reforming reactions [8 - 10]. Depending on the oxidation state of tin, the simple adsorption of H; on Pt was shown to increase [3] or decrease [7-8]. Even if it is clear that the exact preparation procedure (with or without calcination, type of support, nature of precursors, etc.) may partially explain these discrepancies, it could be useful to verify the role of tin in other metal- lic systems. In order to better put in evidence the tin effect, Ir rather than Pt was chosen as the metal to be modified. Two main reasons exist for this choice: (i) Ir is known to be present, on various supports, in a rather good state of dispersion, even at fairly high loadings [11]. (ii) The destructive properties of Ir [12] are quite pronounced, leading in principle to more drastic variations when interacting with Sn. Some results obtained with Ir and Ir Sn supported catalysts have al- ready been presented [13], but it appeared useful to gather some of the main facts and to add the results of new physicochemical characterizations in order to give a wider view on this system. Finally, it is hoped, due to some similarities between Ir and Pt, that the information gained with Ir Sn cata- lysts will help us to understand the behavior of Pt Sn compounds. Experimental procedure Catalyst samples were prepared by impregnation and coimpregnation techniques, using 17-A1203 (Rhone Poulenc) with surface area 200 m2 g~1 as a support and H^IrClg and Snd2 stabilized by HC1 in aqueous solution as precursors. Impregnation was achieved with a large excess of water; the sol- vent was eliminated in a rotative evaporator by evacuation under reduced pressure at 333 K. Final drying was accomplished under air at 373 K for 16 h and samples were stored in this state. 175 The chemical composition of the non-reduced samples were close to 10 wt.% for pure Ir and pure Sn catalysts, and 5+5 wt.% for the bimetallic one. Activation was performed on the impregnated samples under flowing hydrogen (Ha flow 3.6 1 h~1, 0.5 h at room temperature, 0.5 h at 373 K, 2.5 h at 673 K) before the chemisorption measurements and cyclohexane conversion test. Chemisorption was measured in a conventional glass volumetric appara- tus, after desorption under vacuum (P < 0.13 X 10~8 Pa) for 1 h at 673 K. H; adsorption and H^-O^ titrations were carried out at room temperature between 0.13 and 5 kPa of gas pressure. H; adsorption capacity was calcu- lated from the difference between total and back-adsorption isotherms, extrapolated to zero pressure. Catalytic tests were performed at atmospheric pressure between 520 and 673 K; the activated catalysts were cooled down under static H; to reac- tion temperature, and a gaseous mixture H^-C^H^ was passed through the catalytic bed ( 50 mg of catalyst diluted with 200 mg of pure support); the cyclohexane pressure was 11 kPa. Products and non-transformed reac- tant were analyzed by on-line gas chromatography. Activation of catalysts was followed using a Mettler 210 Thermoana- lyzer, with a linear heating rate of 10 K min\"1; the state of tin during reduc- tion was also studied by Mossbauer spectroscopy. In this case, a special cell allowed thermal treatment under controlled atmosphere. The samples, 200 mg each, were pressed in the form of self-supported wafers and treated under H; flow for 1 h at various temperatures (heating rate 5 K min~1) between room temperature and 673 K. The spectra were obtained after cool- ing back to laboratory temperature. The analysis conditions are detailed in [8]. Results and discussion Activation Figure 1 shows DTA curves obtained for Ir, Sn and Ir Sn supported on A1203 catalysts under H; flow. As for other supports [13], these curves may basically be divided in two different parts, above and below 573 K. The low temperature behaviour, linked with a high rate of weight loss, is due to the reduction-decomposition of the supported materials. Above 573 K, a large endothermic peak appears with pure Sn and Ir Sn containing catalysts. This phenomenon, as for ^-Al^O^ and SiO^, is not associated with an increase in weight loss rate. Consequently, it must be attributed to a sample restruc- turation. Figure 2 presents DTA and TGA graphs for the reduction of pure SnClz^HaO. DTA shows three endotherms, one near 473 K due to dehydra- tion, the second one, close to 524 K, is the SnCI; fusion and the third one, beginning before 623 K, is paralleled by a very large weight loss and corres- 176 A T K AT K 1 mg 1 K 373 573 T K 373 573 773 T K Fig. 1.

This last observation, together with the fact that on SiO; a large amount of tin can be lost during activation [3], is taken as indicative of the migration of a tin compound during the activation of supported mono- and bimetallic Sn cata- lysts. Since on Al^Oy no new weight loss is observed in this temperature range, it is supposed that a strong interaction between the mobile tin com- pound and a fraction of the catalyst surface occurs. Whatever the exact chemical modification of the tin compound during the reduction, the above observations show that: (i) the majority of the chemical reorganization in tin-containing cata- lysts takes place below 673 K in reducing atmosphere, and (ii) the high mobility of the tin compound is limited by the presence of the support (and Ir?). Mossbauer study In order to better identify the oxidation state of tin after reduction, in situ Mossbauer spectroscopy was performed on both Sn Alzt^ and Ir Sn Al203 catalysts. Figure 3 shows the spectra obtained for supported Sn after contact for 1 h with Hz at room temperature (curve a), 373 K (curve b), and 673 K (curve c). Table 1 gives the values of isomer shift (IS), quadrupole splitting (QS) and the ratio of peak heights on total signal acquisition (r,na,J- Even if a closer analysis were possible, it appears that Sn in the initial sample is mainly in the form of a Sn(IV) compound, and remains in this 177 COUNTS x 10'6 Pig. 3.

This last treatment, however, increases the apparent con- centration of tin, due to a better fixation of Sn(IV) on the support or to partial dehydration of both Sn compound and alumina surface. Under these experimental conditions reduction begins near 473 K and is practically com- 178 plete at 523 K. At 673 K (spectrum c) the Sn chemical state is clearly modi- fied. Comparison of the values of IS and QS given in Table 1 with literature data [7, 8, 14] indicates that both Sn(IV) and Sn(II) exist in the reduced sample. If we neglect possible variations in the electron density of Sn due to an interaction with Al^O^, the values of IS indicate that Sn(II) and perhaps Sn(IV) are coordinated by Cl or OH groups. Figure 4 and Table 2 give the results obtained for Ir Sn A^Oa cata- lysts reduced under the same conditions. The initial values obtained after treatment at room temperature and 373 K are quite similar to those observed for pure Sn precursor, implying that only a limited interaction between Sn and Ir salts exists after impregnation. In these catalysts, the reduction is practically complete at 473 K. The spectrum c, obtained after a further treatment at 673 K, confirms that the main states of Sn in the bimetallic catalyst are stable between 473 and 673 K. Spectrum c and the correspond- ing components reported in Table 2 are ascribed to a small residue of Sn(IV) and two other lines. These lines can hardly be considered as isolated, espe- cially the second one which would correspond to a small amount of Ir in Sn .6 COUNTS x 10' 0.9058 a 0.9027 8 mm..-' Fig. 4.

It appears better to interpret the two lines as a doublet (IS = 1.35, QS = 1.8 mm s~1) which would correspond to a highly dispersed Ir Sn alloy. According to an extrapolation of known IS values for Sn and IrSn; [15], the alloy would have a composition close to 50-50. The majority of tin, consequently, seems alloyed to Ir and is thus in a metallic Sn(0) state. Adsorption results Table 3 presents the results of H; chemisorption and Hz-O; titration as well as the values of dispersion calculated with the hypothesis that one H or one 0 atom adsorbs on each surface Ir atom. Whereas the results for pure Ir catalyst are in agreement with preceding determinations [16], it clearly appears that supported tin, even in a 'reduced state', does not adsorb measurable quantities of H; or O;. This situation can be presented as further evidence that Sn in a reduced Sn A1203 sample is not in a metallic state. Indeed, it has been observed that, during Hz reduc- tion of unsupported SnOz at 400 C, the partially reduced samples were able to adsorb large amounts of 0; [17]. The values obtained for Ir Sn A1203 catalysts indicate: (i) a strong inhibition of H2 chemisorption, (ii) a partial adsorption of 02 on the reduced tin fraction (consequently in a metallic state), TABLE 3 Adsorption measurement on Sn, Ir and Ir Sn AliC^ catalysts Catalyst QH TO TH D% jumolg-1 /xmolg-1 Jiimolg-1 ___ catal. catal. catal. <v^ l0 1H Ir 115 167 327 43 41 40 Ir Sn 36 147 184 27 73 45 Sn 0 0 0 180 (iii) a H; titration value higher than expected if only indium atoms were concerned (but a lower value than expected if all bimetallic particles had the indium properties). Moreover, since a corrosive 0^ adsorption is also possible, any further discussion on this point is difficult. It must be recalled that a decrease in H; adsorption was also observed for Ir Sn supported on 7^203 and Si02 [16]; in these cases electron microscopy has confirmed that the mean particle size of bimetallic Ir Sn and monometallic Ir samples was similar. In other words, the decrease in H; adsorption capacity is not due to crystallite growth. All the adsorption results favor the fact that a large part of the active Ir area is suppressed by tin, and that this latter, mainly in a metallic state, is in close interaction with Ir. Catalytic activity measurements The results obtained in the conversion of cyclohexane are summarized in Table 4. The activities expressed in ^mol cyclohexane transformed per g of catalyst and per second are calculated after the reaction reaches a pseudo- stationary level (1 h). The numbers in brackets are the values of the apparent activation energies for each subproduct (kJ mol\"1). A number of conclusions can be extracted from this table: (i) supported tin is completely inactive, even at a reaction temperature of 673 K. (ii) the iridium catalyst gives two different classes of products: hydro- genolysis compounds (Ci to Cg hydrocarbons) and dehydrogenation com- pounds (benzene). The major hydrogenolysis product is n-hexane, but it appears clear that multiple hydrogenolysis occurs, probably through new hydrogenolysis ofn-Cg. (iii) the Ir Sn catalyst is completely selective for benzene formation and the apparent activation energy with this catalyst is much lower than the value obtained for the Ir Alaf^ catalyst. It is worth noting that all these trends were also obtained for catalysts supported on 'Y-A1^0y and SiO^ [12].

In the pres- ent case, this suppression has a second implication: there are no more free Ir particles that would lead to C C bond rupture. This observation supports the idea that during activation at least two different chemical 'traps' exist to inhibit the Sn compound mobility: the alumina support (as seen in the case of pure Sn compounds) and Ir particles; it also sustains the idea that it is rather easy to get true bimetallic particles when at least one precursor passes through a mobile species during activation. A last point in this respect is that Ir cannot be considered as present in 'patches' but must be homogeneously dispersed inside the surface alloy structure. The second subject to be discussed is not so easily clarified: it concerns the fact that the activation energy is much lower in the case of a bimetallic catalyst than in the case of pure Ir. This could be a consequence of a 'com- plex geometric effect', in which some steric hindrance would modify the slow step of the reaction (benzene desorption [19]), but it could equally be due to a ligand effect; some tin compound, either Sn(0) in the alloy phase or Sn(II) or unreduced Sn(IV), may modify the electronic density of individual Ir atoms or the electronic density of the whole bimetallic particle. The prob- lem is not easy to solve, as Sn(0) on one hand and ionic tin on the other would create opposite electron transfer directions. It is however interesting to indicate that whereas on pure Ir catalysts the benzene formation slightly increases with time on stream, on Ir Sn samples a true deactivation occurs. This suggests that the initial electronic environment of catalytic sites (Ir) is progressively modified by C deposits. Conclusion Sn appears to be a very strong modifier of Ir. In the samples examined in the present study, tin exists mainly in the form of Sn(0) alloyed with Ir, but a small fraction of tin is also present in the form of ions probably strongly bound to the support. The surface of the bimetallic particles is enriched with tin, and the resulting dilution of Ir suppresses the hydrogenolysis properties of the Group VIII metal. On the other hand, the fact that the activation energy for cyclohexane conversion to benzene is different for Ir and for Ir Sn may be indicative of a ligand effect. Experiments are in progress to try to clarify this last aspect. References 1 M. Masai, K. Honda, A. Kubota, S. Ohnaka, Y. Nishikawa, K. Nakahara, K. Kishi and S. Ikeda, J. Catal., 50 (1977) 419; M.

Tiburcio n-80, 22290 Urca, Rio de JaneiroBrazil Ir, Sn and Ir-Sn high loading catalysts, supported on η-Al2O3, have been studied by various techniques (DTA and TGA, Mos̈sbauer spectroscopy, H2 and O2 adsorption, cyclohexane conversion) in order to understand the role and state of tin in bimetallic catalysts. The results show that after reduction at 673 K the Ir-Sn-Al2O3 catalyst no longer presents the properties of Ir-Al2O3. Strong mobility of the tin entities during reduction has been detected, and is thought to be responsible for the high interaction existing between Ir and Sn(0) in the final sample. Suppression of C-C bond-breaking occurs through dilution of the Ir ensemble by tin. A marked decrease in the apparent activation energy for benzene formation using cyclohexene as a reactant was also observed due to the presence of tin. This fact supports the existence of a ligand effect between Ir and Sn. References 1 a M. Masai K. Honda A. Kubota S. Ohnaka Y. Nishikawa K. Nakahara K. Kishi S. Ikeda J. Catal. 50 1977 419 b M.
