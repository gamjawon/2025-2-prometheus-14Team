In situ obtained Ni2P-based catalysts were proposed for the selective conversion of terephthalic acid into the benzene-toluene-xylene fraction. The catalysts were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and NH3 temperature-programmed desorption. The influence of reaction time, temperature and H2 pressure on the conversion of terephthalic acid and benzene-toluene-xylene selectivity was studied. Direct deoxygenation and decarboxylation were found to be the main reaction pathways using in situ Ni2P catalysts. Selectivity for the benzene-toluene-xylene fraction reached up to 100 % (at full terephthalic acid conversion) under moderate reaction conditions. The reusability of the in situ Ni2P catalyst before and after regeneration was demonstrated. Graphical Abstract Keywords Terephthalic acid Nickel phosphide Ni2P BTX Dispersed catalysts Data Availability I have shared the link to my data at the Attach File step 1 Introduction About 80 million tons of terephthalic acid (TPA) are produced annually in the world [1]. There are several ways to obtain TPA, among which oxidation of p-xylene is the primary. Moreover, a recent method of TPA obtaining is the processing of biomass via the Diels-Alder reaction [2–5] or lignin conversion [6–8]. The main application of TPA obtained is the production of disposable polyethylene terephthalate (PET) [1,9]. However, the rapid growth in plastic consumption focused the world community on approaches to reduce the negative impact of plastic waste (including PET waste) on the environment. As a result, plastic recovery into monomers is one of the research areas of great interest. The most efficient methods of PET waste processing are solvolysis, pyrolysis, and reductive depolymerization [10–13]. It is known that the hydrolysis of PET proceeds with the formation of TPA as a main product, with yield up to 98 % [14–17]. The major products of PET pyrolysis are TPA, benzoic acid, monovinyl terephthalate, etc., which are converted to carbon oxides, ethylene and benzene when the process temperature increases [18,19]. It was reported that at 510 °C, the yield of acids (TPA, benzoic acid) was 45 wt % and further decreased to 29 wt % at 630 °C [18]. Liu et al. proposed using MoO2/C catalysts for PET pyrolysis; the total content of TPA and benzoic acid was 83.27 % at 400 °C [19]. Thus, PET processing is other way to obtain TPA. Nevertheless, a significant disadvantage of TPA obtained via PET processing is that it must be cleaned of dyes and metal-containing compounds before further recovery into good-quality recycled PET (rPET) [20]. However, in the case of processing the resulting TPA into, e.g., aromatic hydrocarbons, the cleaning procedure is significantly simplified. Moreover, aromatic hydrocarbons are widely used as solvents and fuel components. The studies on the catalytic transformation of TPA into benzene are known [21–25]. Typically, CaO [22,23,25] or Ca(OH)2 [24] are used as a TPA decarboxylation catalysts under conditions of steam pyrolysis. Process temperature is high and in a range of 450 °C–700 °C. Hydroprocessing of TPA under milder conditions can produce not only benzene, but also other aromatic hydrocarbons. There are two main pathways of TPA conversion: 1) direct deoxygenation (DDO) with the formation of p-xylene/toluene, and 2) decarboxylation (DCO2) towards benzene/toluene. Toluene can be formed both through the DDO and DCO2 of intermediate products, such as benzoic and p-methylbenzoic acids [26–28]. Hongkailers et al. reported that toluene can be formed through the decarbonylation of p-methylbenzaldehyde, which is the hydrogenation product of p-methylbenzoic acid [26]. Moreover, p-xylene and toluene can be obtained via the DDO of such intermediate products as alcohols, which are formed through the hydrogenation of TPA and its aldehyde derivatives [26]. Li et al. studied the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of carboxylic acids, including TPA, to hydrocarbons using Fe-N-C@Al2O3-900 (nitrogen-doped carbon–alumina hybrid supported iron) catalyst [27]. The conversion of TPA was 50.9 % (320 °C, 4 MPa H2, 8 h), while the main reaction product was p-xylene with 34.6 % of selectivity. Toluene was obtained as a minor product. It was reported that TPA can be completely converted into p-xylene and toluene with 75.2 % selectivity using Co/TiO2 catalyst (340 °C, 3 MPa H2, 4 h), benzene was not detected among the reaction products [26]. Transition metal phosphides, especially nickel phosphide, are known to exhibit high activity in HDO, and can be considered as an alternative to noble metal based catalysts [29,30]. Phosphides possess both metallic and acidic properties. Acidity is associated with the Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, which facilitate the deoxygenation and decarboxylation pathways [31]. Our previous work was indicated that Ni2P-based catalysts are suitable ones for PET recycling into the benzene-toluene-xylene (BTX) fraction [32]. The proposed in situ method for Ni2P-based catalyst synthesis makes it possible to simplify the process due to the absence of a separate stage of catalyst preparation. Moreover, there is no contact with the toxic gas phosphine, which is released when phosphide is formed. In the case of PET recycling in the presence of Ni2P, BTX obtained with high selectivity under harsh conditions (400 °C, 9 MPa H2). In other cases, TPA is one of the main reaction products or produced in significant amounts. The aim of the present work was to investigate the possibility of BTX obtaining from TPA under moderate conditions in the presence of in situ formed Ni2P-based catalysts. The catalytic performance was studied by varying the reaction time, temperature, H2 pressure, and TPA/Ni molar ratio. 2 Experimental 2.1 Chemicals Nickel acetate tetrahydrate (98 %, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and hypophosphorous acid (50 wt% in water, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) were used for precursor preparation. Terephthalic acid (Polyef, Blagoveshchensk, Russia, pure) was used as a substrate and dodecane (Sigma-Aldrich, Burlington, VT, USA, > 99 %) was used as a solvent. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Component-reaktiv, Moscow, Russia, > 99.8 %) was used to remove unreacted terephthalic acid from the catalyst, petroleum ether 40/70 (Component-reaktiv, Moscow, Russia, tech.) and acetone (Component-reaktiv, Moscow, Russia, > 99.5 %) was used for catalyst washing. The gases H2 (≥98 %, Air Liquide, Paris, France) and Ar (≥ 98 %, Air Liquide, Paris, France) were also used. Purchased Ni2P (98 %, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used for comparison with in situ Ni2P. 2.2 Catalytic tests The nickel phosphide-based catalysts were prepared in situ during the hydroprocessing of terephthalic acid in a stainless-steel autoclave reactor. Ni- and P-containing precursor, 109.2 mg of TPA (TPA/Ni molar ratio = 2, 5, 10, 20) and 1.5 g of dodecane were loaded into the reactor in a typical experiment. The synthesis of the precursor was carried out according to the method described in the previous work [32]. The catalytic tests were carried out at 250–400 °C, under the initial H2 pressure of 5–9 MPa, for 1–6 h while undergoing constant magnetic stirring (5000 rpm). When the autoclave was cooled to room temperature after the reaction, the liquid products were separated from the catalyst by centrifugation (5000 × g rpm). The catalyst obtained was repeatedly washed with DMSO to remove unreacted TPA, and then, with petroleum ether and acetone. The catalysts were dried and stored in an Ar atmosphere at room temperature. 2.3 Catalyst characterization and reaction product analysis Phase composition of the catalysts was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Rigaku Rotaflex RU-200 diffractometer with a CuKα radiation. The 2θ was varied in a range of 10–100° with a scanning step of 0.04° and a scanning rate of 1°/min. The qualitative phase composition was determined using the ICDD PDF-2 reference database from powder diffraction patterns. The average crystallite sizes were calculated by the Scherrer equation. The surface composition of the catalysts was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a PREVAC EA15 electronic spectrometer (AlKα radiation, hν = 1486.74 eV, 150 W). The spectra were deconvoluted using the PeakFit program. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained using a FEI Tecnai Osiris electron microscope with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Field emission electron gun operated at 200 kV. The temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3–TPD) analysis was carried out using UNISIT USGA-101 apparatus. At first, the catalyst samples were calcined in a He flow at 500°C for 1 h and then were saturated with NH3 at 60 °C for 15 min. The adsorbed ammonia was removed in a He flow at 100 °C. The NH3–TPD was performed in a He flow (30 ml/min) at a heating rate of 8 °/min. The desorbed NH3 was detected by a thermal conductivity detector. The reaction products were identified by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) on a Thermo Scientific ISQ 7000 GC–MS system equipped with a Restek 5XI-17SIL MS CAP capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm). Gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) was used to determine the quantitative analysis of the reaction products. GLC was performed using a Crystallux 4000 M chromatograph with a flame ionization detector and an Optima-1 capillary column (25 m × 0.32 mm × 0.35 µm). The conversion of TPA (%) and product selectivity (%) were defined using the following equations: Conversion of TPA % = mole of TPA consumed initial mole of TPA × 100 % , Product selectivity % = mole of product ∑ moles of all products × 100 % White solid product obtained after reaction was characterized by NMR. NMR spectra (1H and 13C) were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE III HD spectrometer, (400 and 100 MHz frequency for 1H and 13C, respectively). DMSO-d6 (Solvex-D, Moscow, Russia, 99.8 %) was applied to dissolve the solid product. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst characterization 3.1.1 XRD Fig. 1 and S1 (Online Supplementary material) demonstrates the XRD patterns of the catalysts obtained under various reaction conditions (300–400 °C, 5–9 MPa H2, 1–6 h). In all cases, there are typical reflections of the Ni2P phase (PDF № 3–953). The reflections observed at 2θ = 40.6°, 44.5°, 47.2°, 54.0°, 54.8° are assigned to the (111), (201), (210), (300), (211) planes of Ni2P. The Ni2P phase was formed by the decomposition of the nickel hypophosphite under H2 pressure [33–36] and could also be obtained by the reduction of phosphates [37,38], generated by the precursor disproportionation. d’Aquino et al. [39] carried out an investigation of Ni(H2PO2)2 decomposition by temperature-programmed reduction – mass spectrometry (TPR–MS) measurements. Based on the results of TPR–MS, the reaction of Ni(H2PO2)2 towards Ni2P occurs at 195–288 °C, and the following equation was suggested: 12Ni(H2PO2)2 + 35 H2→6Ni2P + 14PH3 + 32 H2O + 4 H3PO4. In addition to Ni2P, NiH2P2O7 (PDF № 34–617) and Ni(PO3)2 (PDF № 28–708) phases were found; their formation was also associated with disproportionation of precursor [40–42]. As shown in Figure S1, as reaction time rose from 1 h to 6 h (300 °C, 5 MPa H2), an increase in the intensity of Ni2P characteristic reflections was identified. This may indicate an increase in the crystallinity degree of the Ni2P phase [43]. No significant differences in the phase composition were observed in the XRD patterns of samples formed at 300 °C and 400 °C, under 5 MPa H2, and 300 °C, under 9 MPa H2 (Fig. 1). However, the disappearance of most of the NiH2P2O7 and Ni(PO3)2 reflections was observed with temperature increasing to 400 °C, under 9 MPa H2 (Fig. 1). Thus, the formation of the Ni2P phase has been already pointed out at 300 °C, under 5 MPa H2, after 1 h, but with a high content of nickel phosphates in the sample. However, further increase in temperature, H2 pressure and reaction time promoted the reduction of nickel phosphates to nickel phosphide. Carrying out the reaction at 400 °C, under 9 MPa H2, for 6 h leads to the formation predominantly the Ni2P phase. Table S1 summarizes the average crystallite sizes of the Ni2P phase of all samples. An increase in the reaction duration as well as an increase in temperature and H2 pressure were shown to lead to the Ni2P crystallite growth. The most significant growth of Ni2P crystallites was found when the pressure increased from 5 to 9 MPa H2 at 400 °C (from 40 ± 2–48 ± 4 nm). 3.1.2 XPS The XPS analysis was carried out to examine the chemical states of Ni and P on the catalyst surface. For a comparison, the XP-spectra of samples obtained under various reaction conditions are presented in Fig. 2. The Ni 2p spectra of all catalysts samples involved three peaks located at 850.8–853.2 eV, 853.7–855.5 eV and 855–860.4 eV, that are attributed to Niδ+ [44,45], Ni2+ [44,45] and shake-up satellite [46] in the 2p3/2 region, respectively. The valence states of Niδ+ and Ni2+ were assigned to nickel phosphides and nickel phosphates, respectively. According to the Figure S2, the P 2p spectrum of catalysts obtained for 1–6 h (300 °C, 5 MPa) has only peaks related to P5+ in 2p3/2 (133.3–135.1 eV) and 2p1/2 (134.9–136.5 eV) regions in phosphate [46,47]. The presence of P5+ doublet is due to the decomposition of nickel hypophosphite into phosphates and surface oxidation of the catalysts obtained. The low-intensity doublets at 130.1–130.5 eV (2p3/2) and 131.6–131.8 eV (2p1/2) were detected as temperature increased from 300 to 400 °C (under 5 MPa H2) and were attributed to Pδ- in Ni2P [44,46]. To conclude, the XPS spectra indicated the presence of peaks associated with Niδ+ and Pδ-, confirmed the in-situ formation of Ni2P during TPA hydroprocessing, as well as the XRD results. The XPS data calculated from the deconvoluted Ni 2p and P 2p spectra of the samples are presented in Table S2. It was demonstrated, that an increase in the reaction time has a weak effect on the Ni2P surface content estimated at 300 °C, 5 MPa H2. The effect of temperature and H2 pressure was investigated at 300 and 400 °C, under 5 and 9 MPa, for 6 h. As temperature increased from 300 to 400 °C the Niδ+ content insignificantly increased from 3 % to 7 % under 5 MPa and from 9 % to 10 % under 9 MPa. Moreover, the content of Pδ- increased from 0 % to 3 % (5 MPa) and from 9 % to 22 % (9 MPa) with increasing of temperature from 300 to 400 °C. Thus, a noticeable increase in the Ni2P surface content was observed with an increase in temperature under high H2 pressure. Furthermore, a rise in H2 pressure was shown to have more effect than that in reaction time and temperature on the increase in the Ni2P surface content. 3.1.3 HRTEM HRTEM with EDX mapping was applied for Ni2P-based catalysts obtained after 1–6 h (300 °C, 5 MPa) to investigate the morphology and the distributions of elements. According to the measurements from HRTEM images, the catalyst formed after 1 h has a crystal lattice with an interplanar spacing of 0.192 nm, which is the characteristic value of the (210) plane in Ni2P ( Fig. 3d). In addition, the reflection of the (110) plane was found in the diffraction patterns made using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the microphotograph (Fig. 3g). A crystal lattice with a spacing of 0.221 nm was observed in HRTEM images of the samples obtained after 3 and 6 h and belongs to the (111) plane in Ni2P (Fig. 3e,f). The Ni2P reflections were also confirmed by the diffraction patterns performed using FFT (Fig. 3g–j). As seen in the elemental maps of the catalyst samples, there is a uniform distribution of Ni and P elements (Figures S3–S5). The presence of oxygen indicates the formation of phosphates. HRTEM results are in a good agreement with XRD and XPS analyzes. 3.1.4 NH3–TPD The acidity of the catalysts was characterized by the NH3–TPD method. For comparison, the NH3–TPD profiles of the samples obtained under different reaction conditions (300–400 °C, 5–9 MPa H2, 6 h) are displayed in Fig. 4. The NH3 curves of all samples had the desorption peak centered between 150 °C and 200 °C, which is mainly related to the weak acid sites of the P–OH groups (Brønsted acidity) [44,48]. An increase in reaction temperature from 300 to 400 °C (5 MPa) was found not to affect the amount of desorbed NH3 (15 µmol/g in both cases), and, accordingly, the acidity of these samples. However, the amount of desorbed NH3 greatly increased to 42 µmol/g for the catalyst sample obtained at 300 °C (9 MPa, 6 h). A rise in H2 pressure had more effect on an increase in the catalyst acidity compared to an increase in temperature. To explain the results of NH3–TPD, the chemical state of the oxygen atoms over the catalysts surface was studied by the deconvolution of the XP-spectra in the O 1 s region (Figure S6). There are three characteristic peaks corresponding to O-Ni (530.3–531.1 eV), O-P (531.3–532.7 eV) and OH-groups (532.5–533.7 eV) [38,45,49–51]. The calculated content of all states and corresponding binding energies are given in Table S3. According to Table S3, an increase in OH-groups content from 45 % to 59 % was observed when the H2 pressure increased from 5 to 9 MPa H2 at 300 °C. This result may be due to greater H2 adsorption with subsequent formation of P–OH groups. In the [52,53], the acidity of supported Ni2P obtained ex situ by temperature-programmed reduction of nickel phosphate or phosphite at different temperatures was studied. It was shown that as the reduction temperature increased the overall acidity of catalysts was decreased due to a decrease in the amount of P–OH groups on the catalysts surface. As can be seen from Table S3, the content of surface OH-groups slightly changed as temperature increased from 300 to 400 °C (5 MPa). This fact can be explained by the strong adsorption of reaction products containing hydroxyl groups (benzoic acid or TPA) on the surface of the catalysts. It is assumed that the acidity in this case was influenced by the amount of H2 in the system. An increase in the H2 amount in the system apparently led to an increase in P–OH groups on the surface of the catalysts, which was shown by the XPS data in O 1 s region. 3.2 The catalytic tests The hydroprocessing of TPA using in situ generated Ni2P was investigated under various reaction conditions (250–400 °C, 5–9 MPa H2, 1–6 h). The BTX fraction, benzoic and p-methylbenzoic acid were detected among the reaction products. White solid product obtained after reaction was characterized by NMR (Figures S7, S8). It was proven to be unreacted TPA. The proposed reaction pathways of TPA transformations over Ni2P-based catalysts are shown in Fig. 5a. Through one pathway, TPA can be converted into benzoic acid and benzene via decarboxylation, which occurs in the presence of metal sites [54]. Another pathway is the direct deoxygenation of TPA with the formation of p-methylbenzoic acid and p-xylene; DDO route occurs in the presence of acid sites [31]. Some studies reported that hydrocarbons, in particular BTX, can be derived via deoxygenation of aldehydes and alcohols, which can be produced by hydrogenation of acids [26–28]. However, none of these intermediates were identified among the reaction products using in situ generated Ni2P catalysts. Moreover, benzene can be formed by the further DCO2 of benzoic acid over metal sites [31], and p-xylene by the DDO of p-methylbenzoic acid over acid sites [28]. Toluene can be obtained through the DDO of benzoic acid over acid sites [28,55] or the DCO2 p-methylbenzoic acid over metal sites [31]. The results of all experiments are summed up in Table 1. The influence of temperature (Fig. 5b, S9) was studied in a range of 250–400 °C (5–9 MPa H2, 6 h). BTX and benzoic acid were formed as reaction products over the entire range of temperatures. p-Methylbenzoic acid was not detected at reaction time of 6 h. This result can be explained by the presence of a CH3-group in p-methylbenzoic acid, which facilitates decarboxylation (DCO2) with the formation of toluene and direct deoxygenation (DDO) with the formation of p-xylene. Higher temperatures were shown to contribute to a rapid increase in the TPA conversion from 47 % to 97 % (5 MPa H2) as the temperature rose from 250 to 400 °C, which correlated with an increase in the selectivity for BTX from 25 % to 98 %. To conclude, an increase in reaction temperature had a greater effect on the selectivity for DCO2 products. For instance, as the temperature increased from 250 to 400 °C (at 5 MPa H2) the selectivity for benzoic acid decreased from 75 % to 2 % (Figure S9). The selectivity for benzene decreased from 6 % to 39 %, while the selectivity for toluene rose from 11 % to 33 %. Thus, the formation of benzene is largely due to DCO2 of benzoic acid and TPA. This result is in good agreement with the increase in Niδ+ content as temperature increased (Table S2). In order to clearly demonstrate the effect of reaction time on the composition of reaction products, experiments were carried out at 300 °C, for 1–6 h. As the reaction time increased from 1 to 6 h the conversion of TPA essentially increased from 19 % to 85 % with (Fig. 5c). Selectivity for BTX rose from 33 % to 70 %, whereas the selectivity for benzoic and p-methylbenzoic acids decreased. Moreover, after 6 h p-methylbenzoic acid was not detected among the reaction products (Fig. 5a). Benzoic acid, in turn, can be converted to benzene via DCO2 and to toluene via DDO [18]. Benzene and p-xylene can also be formed by the DCO2 and DDO of TPA, respectively [18]. A rise in H2 pressure from 5 to 9 MPa at 300–400 °C had a low effect on the values of TPA conversion. However, at 250 °C, the conversion of TPA and the selectivity for BTX increased from 47 % to 72 % and from 25 % to 61 %, respectively, when the H2 pressure rose from 5 to 9 MPa. TPA was noted to be completely converted to BTX at 350 °C and 9 MPa H2. The effect of the TPA/Ni molar ratio was studied at 300 °C, 5 MPa H2, 6 h (Table 1). As the TPA/Ni ratio increased from 2 to 20, the TPA conversion decreased from 70 % to 14 %. This increase in the molar ratio also resulted in a decrease in the selectivity for BTX from 85 % to 20 %. Thus, the optimal molar ratios of TPA/Ni are 2–10 at 300 °C, and a further increase leads to a significant decrease in the TPA conversion. However, with an increase in temperature, the selectivity for BTX is assumed to be high at TPA/Ni = 20. It is known that the high catalytic activity of Ni2P catalysts is associated with the presence of metal and acid active sites. Niδ+ act as metal active sites, and the acidity is due to Ni2+ and P-OH species, which are Lewis and Brønsted acid sites, respectively [31,54]. DDO and DCO2 are the main reactions in the processing of TPA using the in situ Ni2P catalyst (Fig. 5, S9). Generally, the DDO pathway occurs over acid sites, while metal sites are responsible for the DCO2 route [56,57]. The NH3–TPD results showed that the acidity of in situ Ni2P-based catalysts was directly associated with Brønsted acid sites of P–OH groups and significantly increased with an increase in H2 pressure. According to the results of the catalytic tests, with an increase in H2 pressure from 5 to 9 MPa at 300 °C, the selectivity for benzoic acid decreased from 30 % to 14 %. The selectivity for toluene increased from 26 % to 39 %, and for benzene from 25 % to 28 % (Figure S9). Thus, there is a direct correlation between a rise in catalyst acidity and an increase in selectivity for deoxygenated products. In addition, the selectivity for benzoic acid decreased from 30 % to 4 %, which can be related to its decarboxylation into benzene over Niδ+ metal sites. Judging by the XPS results, Niδ+ surface content rose from 3 % to 9 % when H2 pressure increased from 5 to 9 MPa at 300°C. Moreover, the selectivity for benzoic acid significantly decreased from 30 % to 2 % with temperature increasing from 300 °C to 400 °C under 5 MPa H2, while the selectivity for benzene increased by 1 % and for toluene by only 4 %. It can be concluded that an increase in reaction temperature had a greater effect on the selectivity for DCO2 products. To confirm the proposed reaction pathways (Fig. 5a), additional experiments with such intermediate products as p-methylbenzoic and benzoic acid were carried out at 350 °C, 5 MPa H2, for 15 min, 30 min and 1 h. The conversion of p-methylbenzoic acid enhanced from 47 % to 72 % with an increase in reaction time from 15 min to 1 h (Figure S10). Toluene was the main reaction product, which was formed via the DCO2 of p-methylbenzoic acid. p-Xylene was also detected among the reaction products. Moreover, as reaction time increased from 15 min to 1 h the selectivity for p-xylene increased from 9 % to 14% due to the DDO of p-methylbenzoic acid. In the case of benzoic acid (Figure S11), the conversion was 40 % after 15 min, and gradually increased to 66 % after 1 h. Benzene was the major product (the selectivity 83–87 %), which is formed through the DCO2 of benzoic acid. In addition, DDO reaction occurred with the formation of toluene, the selectivity of which was 13 % after 15 min and 17% after 1 h. Thus, benzene was mainly formed as a result of benzoic acid DCO2, toluene – due to the DCO2 of p-methylbenzoic acid and the DDO of benzoic acid, and p-xylene as a result of the TPA DDO. Despite the fact that toluene was formed in two ways, and the selectivity of its formation from p-methylbenzoic acid is high, its selectivity did not exceed or slightly did the selectivity for benzene and p-xylene. This may indicate that p-methylbenzoic acid was formed in much smaller amounts than benzoic acid. 3.3 Recycling tests Additionally, the recyclability and regeneration of in situ Ni2P-based catalyst was researched ( Fig. 6). Five runs of recycling tests were consecutively carried out at 250 °C, 7 MPa H2, for 6 h. After the 1st run, the conversion of TPA decreased from 58 % to 50 %, but the selectivity for BTX did not substantially change and was 40–42 %. After the 3rd run, a slight decrease in catalyst activity was observed, as a result of which the selectivity for BTX decreased. The conversion of TPA was 39 % after the 3rd run and 28 % after the 5th. After the 5th cycle, the catalyst was regenerated at 400 °C (5 MPa H2, 1 h), and then was used in two runs. The 6th cycle – the first run after regeneration, whereas the 7th cycle is without preliminary regeneration. The regeneration of the catalyst led to an increase in TPA conversion from 28 % (after the 5th run) to 50 % (after the 7th run). Selectivity for BTX also increased from 30 % to 48 %. To understand the nature of the increase in the catalyst activity after regeneration, additional studies were carried out. The catalyst obtained after the 7th run were investigated using the XRD and XPS (Figure S12). XRD patterns of the catalyst after recycling tests show that reflections of Ni2P phase (PDF № 3–953, the average crystallite sizes were 37±3 nm) were mainly present. Moreover, in situ Ni2P-based catalyst obtained after recycling tests was also studied by the XPS (Figure S12, Table S2). The Ni 2p and P 2p spectra involved typical peaks related to Niδ+ and Pδ- in Ni2P, as well as peaks associated with Ni2+ and its shake-up satellite and P5+ in nickel phosphates. Thus, the improvement in catalytic performance may be associated with the additional formation of the Ni2P active phase due to the reduction of phosphates during regeneration in H2 atmosphere. 3.4 Additional experiments The additional experiment using purchased Ni2P was carried out at 350 °C, 5 MPa, 6 h (Figure S13). The conversion of TPA was 85 % and the selectivity for BTX was only 53 %. For comparison, the conversion of TPA was 94 % using in situ Ni2P, while the selectivity for BTX was 80 %. Thus, in situ Ni2P demonstrated higher TPA conversion and the selectivity for BTX compare to purchased Ni2P. 4 Conclusions The results of the catalyst characterization (XRD, XPS and HRTEM) showed the formation of the Ni2P phase during TPA hydroprocessing at 250–400 °C, 5–9 MPa H2, 1–6 h. It was noted that carrying out the reaction at 400 °C, 9 MPa H2, 6 h led to the formation predominantly the Ni2P phase (XRD), while the selectivity for the BTX fraction was achieved 100 % at full TPA conversion. Nevertheless, at lower temperature (350 °C) 100 % of the selectivity for BTX was also observed at full TPA conversion. It was shown that, the excellent performance of the in situ Ni2P-based catalysts is attributed to two types of the catalyst active sites. Niδ+ species act as metal active sites (DCO2 route), and the acidity of the catalysts is due to Ni2+ and P–OH species (DDO route), which are act as Lewis and Brønsted acid sites, respectively (XPS, NH3–TPD). An increase in the acidity of the catalysts directly affects the increase in the selectivity for p-xylene and toluene; whereas an increase in the content of metal sites affects the increase in the selectivity for benzene and toluene. In addition, in situ Ni2P-based catalysts were shown to be more active than purchased Ni2P, and to be reused for the hydroprocessing of TPA with some decrease in activity. The catalyst regeneration after 5th run under H2 atmosphere contributed to an increase in catalytic activity.

        "dc:description": "In situ obtained Ni2P-based catalysts were proposed for the selective conversion of terephthalic acid into the benzene-toluene-xylene fraction. The catalysts were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and NH3 temperature-programmed desorption. The influence of reaction time, temperature and H2 pressure on the conversion of terephthalic acid and benzene-toluene-xylene selectivity was studied. Direct deoxygenation and decarboxylation were found to be the main reaction pathways using in situ Ni2P catalysts. Selectivity for the benzene-toluene-xylene fraction reached up to 100 % (at full terephthalic acid conversion) under moderate reaction conditions. The reusability of the in situ Ni2P catalyst before and after regeneration was demonstrated.",
