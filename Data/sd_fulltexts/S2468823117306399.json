Graphical abstract Three hydrotalcite – type materials (Cu (Co)/Fe−LDHs) have been synthesized by facile co-precipitation method with (Co2+ +Cu2+)/Fe3+ =2. These samples are used as catalysts and their catalytic activity behavior were tested towards toluene conversion at different reaction temperatures (300–450°C) using a fixed bed flow system operated under atmospheric pressure. Characterizations of the prepared materials have been studied by different techniques, N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm, XRD, FT-IR, SEM, TEM and NH3-TPD. The effect of copper incorporation with different Cu2+/(Co2+ +Cu2+)=0, 0.35 and 0.6 on the structural, morphological and catalytic activity were investigated. Significant structural, morphological, acidic strength and catalytic differences were emphasized between the three catalysts. The catalytic activity results clarified that 0.35 Cu(Co)/Fe-LDH sample is an efficient catalyst with ∼99% toluene conversion into trimethylbenzenes(TMBs) at 450°C. The selectivity to TMBs produced product was not temperature dependent reaching ∼93% at 375°C, due to the proper balance between acidity and copper content ratio within the Co/Fe-LDH lattice. The estimated excel equations are adequate and in agreement with the experimental results.

Through which the less valuable toluene is transformed to valuable products such as xylenes, ethylbenzene, cumene or trimethylbenzenes. Isomerization, alkylation, transalkylation, and disproportionation are different approaches to manufactory alkyl aromatics [2]. The disproportionation reaction of toluene to produce equimolar amounts of benzene and xylenes is well known, Eq. (1), along with more highly substituted methylbenzene isomers may be produced by subsequent reactions between the primary products. This is generally defined as a transalkylation reaction [3]. (1) Disproportionation of aromatic hydrocarbons is an important acid catalyzed petrochemical reaction [4]. Mixtures of silica and alumina were impregnated with platinum, various forms of mordenite including dealuminized modifications were active and had low aging rates and the faujasites exchanged with rare earth or transition metals were used for toluene disproportionation [5]. For the transalkylation reaction various types of medium pore zeolites such as ZSM-5 [6] and large pore ones such as ZSM-12 [7] have been tested. Recently, Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) materials attracted much attention due to their own special characteristics; lamellar structures, high surface areas, acidic properties, high ion-exchange capacities, economic, the versatile and easy methods of preparation [8]. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), also known as hydrotalcite- like compounds or anionic clays, are borrowed either from the structure of mineral brucite [Mg(OH)2], or from that of bayerite/gibbsite [Al(OH)3] [9]. LDHs structure consists of positively charged mixed metal hydroxide layers separated by charge-balancing anions and water molecules. LDHs have the structural formula [M2+ 1-xM3+ x(OH)2]x+ (Am−)x/m. nH2O where Am− denotes to interlayer anions, such as NO3 −, SO4 2− and CO3 2−, M2+ =Mg2+, Zn2+, Ni2+ etc. M3+ =Al3+, Cr3+, Ga3+ etc. and x ranges from 0.17 to 0.33. This charge excess is produced by the isomorphic substitution of a divalent cation with a trivalent cation that is compensated by the introduction of anions (together with water) in the interlayer space [10]. LDHs have been studied extensively as trapping agents and ion-exchangers for anionic contaminants because of their high capacity and affinity for a range of anions [11], as catalysts [12], catalyst precursors [13], super capacitors [14], flame retardants [15] and bioactive nanocomposites [16]. This paper reports the synthesis of x Cu(Co)/Fe-LDHs and test their performances toward toluene conversion in a fixed bed reactor operated under atmospheric pressure. Synthesized LDHs were characterized by (XRD), (FT-IR), TGA-DSC, DLS, SEM, TEM, N2- adsorption/desorption isotherm and NH3-TPD. Due to its lamellar structure and unique pore size that is comparable to the molecular dimension of mordenite [5], Layered Double Hydroxide samples (LDHs) are prepared to differentiate their catalytic activity towards toluene conversion. To the best of author’s knowledge, this kind of study of investigating LDH catalytic activity toward shape selective toluene conversion has not yet been reported. 2 Experimental procedure 2.1 Materials The starting materials, Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, Fe(NO3)3. 9H2O, Na2CO3 and NaOH are reagent grade, of 99.9% purity (purchased from Sigma Aldrich Chemical Reagent Company). 2.2 xCu (Co)/Fe-LDHs samples preparation xCu (Co)-Fe-LDHs were prepared with molar ratio (Co2+ +Cu2+)/Fe3+ =2 using a co-precipitation method [17]. In a typical procedure, 200mL of mixed Co2+, Cu2+ and Fe3+ nitrate solution was slowly added dropwise into 200mL of another aqueous solution containing 1.0molL−1 NaOH and 0.3molL−1 Na2CO3 under vigorous mechanical stirring (the pH of the slurry=9-10). The obtained samples with Cu2+/(Cu2+ +Co2+) molar contents of 0, 35% and 60% (where the relation Co2+ +Cu2+ =0.06mol is kept constant) were submitted to an ageing treatment at 60°C for 72 h. The slurry was centrifuged and washed several times with distilled water until the pH=7. After that, the precipitates were dried at 60°C for 7d. The materials with Cu2+/(Co2+ +Cu2+)=0%, 35% and 60% are labeled Co/Fe, 0.35 Cu(Co)/Fe & 0.6 Cu (Co)/Fe, respectively. 2.3 Characterization of the prepared samples XRD was performed on a Shimadzu XD-1 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. The XRD patterns were collected at room temperature in a 2θ range of 10–70° with a scan rate of 0.7°s−1. The coherent scattering domain (CSD) size of the samples was determined from the (003) XRD peak at 2Ɵ=12° using the Scherrer equation. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was performed to determine the particle size distribution of samples using zeta sizer nano series HT (Nano-ZS) (Malvern Instruments). To prepare the DLS samples, a dilute particle–Tetrahydrofurane (THF) colloidal mixture was ultrasonicated for 30min. The measurement was repeated at least 3 times for each sample to insure the reproducibility. The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were measured using a NOVA 3200S Unite, automates gas sorption analyzer (Quantachrome Corporation) surface area and pore size analyser. The samples were degassed at 250°C for 12h before the measurements. The Brunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET) method was used to calculate the specific surface area, while the micro-pore surface area (Smicro) and micro-pore volume (Vmicro) of the samples were obtained by t-plot analysis. The pore size distribution curve was obtained from an analysis of the adsorption branch using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. To characterize the acidity, temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) was carried out at a dynamic chemisorption analyzer (B1 Cat II). Prior to NH3 adsorption at 200°C for 0.5h, the sample was pretreated in helium flow at 550°C for 0.5h. After that, the physically adsorbed NH3 was removed in a flow of helium for 0.5h, followed by heating to 600°C with a rate of 10Kmin−1. The ammonia desorption signals were recorded with a TCD detector. The FT-IR spectra were obtained on a spectrometer Perkin-Elmer-Spectrum using the KBr pelleting method over the frequency range, 4000–400cm−1. Thermal stability was investigated with SDTQ-600 (TA-USA) thermo balance instrument. Typically, around 20mg of sample was heated in an Al2O3crucible at a constant heating rate of 10°C/min from 25 to 650°C, with air purging at a flow rate of 100mL/min. The morphology of the prepared samples obtained by (HRTEM) using a JEOL 2100F TEM at an accelerating voltage of 200kV and (SEM) on a FEI QUANTA FEG 250 field emission scanning electron microscope. Chemical analysis for Co, Cu and Fe were carried out by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP – OES), using a Thermo elemental 720 ICP-OES, Agilent Technologies apparatus, after dissolution of the sample in 0.1molL−1HCl. 2.4 The catalytic activity of the prepared LDHs samples Toluene (>99%) was purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. (USA). The prepared LDH samples were activated at 400°C for 2h in air flow before being used. Toluene conversion reaction was performed using a fixed bed reactor containing 1g of the prepared LDH sample (size of 0.125mm). The reactor temperature was maintained at a certain degree under the air flow with an air/toluene molar ratio of 5 and WHSV of 1.5h −1. A syringe pump was used to inject toluene into the reactor at a fixed rate at atmospheric pressure. The air gas flow was regulated with a mass flow controller, and the reactor temperature was controlled with a tubular furnace equipped with a programmable temperature controller and a K-type thermocouple. The product (liquid phase) was analyzed using Perkin- Elmer gas chromatograph with hydrogen flame ionization detector (FID) and using the HP-1 (cross − linked Methyl Silicone) 60m×0.32mm×0.5μm column. The activity of the LDH samples was described by the total conversion of toluene and the selectivity towards trimethylbenzene formation. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst characterization Fig. 1 exhibits the XRD patterns of Co/Fe, 0.35& 0.6 Cu(Co)/Fe- LDHs from which the crystal structure of LDH (i.e., 2θ=12°, 25.2°, 35.5°, 39.2°, 43°,60.1°, and 61°) can be verified for all samples [18] ascribed to (003), (006), (002), (012), (015),(018), (110) and (113) planes. First, as a result of comparing the peaks between the LDH samples due to insertion of copper with Cu2+/(Cu2++ Co2+) molar contents of 0, 35% and 60%, it was verified that even with the increase in copper content (Fig. 1b & c), the XRD patterns of the Co/Fe-LDH basically does not change, and no diffraction peaks indexed to Cu are detected, indicating that the LDH structures are maintained and the Cu is highly dispersed (Fig. 1),So we believed that the as-prepared x Cu(Co)/Fe LDH formed of pure crystalline layered double hydroxide sample [19,20]. However, the XRD peaks increased more sharply in size and become more intense, compared to Co/Fe–LDH as the copper content increases within the LDH lattice, reflecting the formation of the pure crystalline layered double hydroxide samples. As a result, it is noted that the crystal structure of Co/Fe −LDH received some effect from the insertion of copper into Co/Fe −LDH. Along with, the coherent scattering domain size (CSD) calculated using the Scherer equation (Table 1 ) was 20nm for Co/Fe-LDH, 26nm for 0.35 Cu(Co)/Fe and it increases to 30nm as the copper content increases for 0.6 Cu(Co)/Fe sample. Second, the LDH lattice cell parameters (a & c) of the prepared samples are calculated from X-ray data (Table 1), where c parameter corresponds to three times the (d003) diffraction peak at 2 Ɵ=12°. From data it can be observed that the c parameter is constant (2.08–Table 1) for all the samples, that matching also with the published data [21] for LHDs containing CO3 −2 as the interlamellar anion. In other words, the layer thickness (the layer distances) are constant (2.08nm) for Co/Fe, 0.35 Cu(Co)/Fe and 0.6 Cu(Co)/Fe-LDH samples. At the same time, the (a) unit cell parameter stands for the Cu(Co)2+–Fe3+ average distance inside the layers can be determined from the (d110) reflection at 2Ɵ=60°. It was found that all the prepared LDH samples have the same value (0.3nm) for the (a) cell parameter (Table 1), which emphasized that the original structure of the brucite-like layer is unchanged. This is reasonable since Co2+ and Cu2+ have very similar ionic radius. Table 1 shows the Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements. It is used to determine the average particle size distribution of the prepared LDH samples. The obtained values reveal that the LDH samples are in nano-sized range (˂1000nm) and the average particle size distribution of Co/Fe-LDH was 231nm that is increased to 304 & 364nm For 0.35 & 0.6 Cu(Co)/Fe −LDH samples, respectively. The large difference of the size of the samples obtained by Scherrer equation computation and by Dynamic light scattering technology (DLS) may be attributed to that the average crystal sizes obtained by XRD analysis reflect only the crystal size in certain direction (the coherent scattering domain (CSD)) whereas the dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique depends on measuring the different intensities of the scattered laser light from the dispersed particles or molecules (in Tetrahydrofurane liquid). The two sizes given by the two tools are always different due to the structure disorder in the crystal structure and the shape of the crystal [22]. Fig. 2 clarifies the representative (a) SEM and (b) TEM images of pristine-Co/Fe and x Cu(Co)/Fe-LDH. Both SEM and TEM images provide excellent evidence of the existences of sheet-like morphology and good quality material. The hexagonal plate-like morphology is preserved even with the increase in copper content up to 0.6 in the brucite-like sheets, which clearly supports the XRD data. However, the TEM image of 0.6 Cu(Co)/Fe-LDH (Fig. 2c) shows the hexagonal plate-like particles with a high degree of agglomeration, that is associated with the formation of brucite-like sheets with small distorted octahedral units around the Cu sites, the distortion introduced can be accommodated within the crystalline lattice, keeping the layered structure pure (XRD results). Justifying DLS results that admit the increase in the particle size of this sample if compared with non-doped copper Co/Fe-LDH sample (Table 1). Table 2 gives the textural parameters of xCu(Co)/Fe-LDH samples. It is apparent that the insertion of Cu2+ cations with 0.35 and 0.6 within the LDH lattice has a notable impact on the SBET, VP & DP, which suffered a decrease compared to Co/Fe-LDH sample (Table 2). This may be explained by, upon insertion of Cu2+ cations within the LDH lattice caused a major decrease of porosity probably due to the distortion of the octahedral units (TEM image, Fig. 2c), which has a direct influence on the micro-texture of the obtained samples as evidenced from the increase in the micro-pore volume from 0.01 to 0.03cm3/g and the decrease in pore diameter from 3.8 to 3.4nm, indicating that a certain interaction between the copper and cobalt species occurred resulting in an increase in the average particle size (from 231 to 364nm, Table 1), served in pore narrowing, (as established from DLS results). Hence, a decrease of external surface is observed. However, The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms type is preserved for Co/Fe and x Cu(Co)/Fe-LDHs (Fig. 3 A), indicating that the lamellar morphology is mostly retained upon insertion of copper with different percent within the Co/Fe – LDH lattice (in agreement with the TEM results). The isotherms for all the samples could be classified as type IV, with a broad H3-type hysteresis loop (p/p0 >0.4), according to IUPAC classification, which is caused by the presence of slit type pores that are created from the plate-like particles characterizing the feature of the layered materials [23]. As in agreement TEM and SEM images (Fig. 2). The N2 adsorption isotherms of all the prepared LDH samples showed neither a plateau nor limiting uptake at high P/P0 values. These results confirmed the multilayer adsorption that takes place between the aggregates of the platelets particles [24]. Along with, the height and sharpness of the capillary condensation steep indicates pore size uniformity (Fig. 3B) which can be correlated with the different composition of the layered sheets [25]. Generally, the LDH-type materials are characterized by an external surface mesoporosity since the N2 diameter is larger than the interlamellar space for carbonate-containing LDHs. So any change in the porosity characteristics may be attributed to the alteration of the microscopic morphology caused by the presence of different cations within the structure [26]. The presence of the Cu2+ cations within the Co/Fe-LDH lattice, leads to a distortion of the octahedral sheets around the Cu sites as confirmed by TEM image (Fig. 2C). This has a direct influence on the porosity of the prepared LDH samples, lowering the accessibility of surface for N2 molecules uptake gradually, and as a consequence lower surface area (Table 2). As shown, the amount and strength distribution of surface acidity influence the activity performance of the prepared LDH samples. And the acidity of the samples was measured by NH3-TPD technique. All the samples showed similar peak profiles inNH3-TPD curves (Fig. 4 a–c). The profiles were separated into four peaks by fitting curves with Gaussian function, which represented weak centered at around 222°C, two medium-strength and a strong acidity located at approximately 270°C, 300°C and 500°C, respectively [27]. Data in Table 3 presents the amount of each type strength acid site that distributed on the prepared samples. The total acid sites decreased in order of: 0.35 Cu (Co)/Fe (11.77μmol/g)>0.6 Cu (Co)/Fe (7.86μmol/g)>Co/Fe-LDH (5.97μmol/g). It could be observed that the amount of medium- strength acidic sites increased with the increase in the Copper content within the LDH lattice (Table 3); however, the number of strong acidic sites exhibited a slightly increasing tendency with the copper content. All the prepared Co/Fe, 0.35 Cu (Co)/Fe & 0.6 Cu (Co)/Fe −LDH samples exhibit typical FT-IR spectrum that is characterize the LDH compounds containing CO3 2− group as an interlayer anion (Fig. 5 ) [17]. They showed a broad and intense band around 3500cm−1 attributed to the stretching vibration of the hydroxyl groups (ν OH) and water molecules in the layered structure, whereas a weak shoulder peak recorded at 2923cm−1 (marked with a black dot) assigned to the OHO stretching mode of the interlayer water molecules, and hydrogen-bonded to interlayer CO3 2−. The presence of a remarkable narrow mode at 3547cm−1 (marked with an up arrow) is assigned to the OH stretching of free metallic hydroxide, whereas its intensity increased as the copper content increased. The bending mode band of the water molecules is recorded as a weak shoulder at 1625cm−1 for all the prepared samples [28]. The sharp splitted band observed at about 1355cm−1 (Fig. 5) is attributed to the ν3 asymmetric stretching of the CO3 2−. The ν3 mode detected appears down shifted by 60cm−1 when compared with the free CO3 2− (ν3 =1415cm−1) due to the formed hydrogen bonds via the interactions between the CO3 2− anions and the water molecules that located in the interlayer region. However, these hydrogen bonds are not strong enough to distort the free D3h symmetry of the CO3 2− anions. The splitting of CO3 2− peak may be due to the presence of both CO and CO bonds [29]. The position of the CO3 2− anions asymmetric stretching band does not depend on Cu content in the prepared LDH samples [30]. The ν2 bending mode of the CO3 2− anions was observed at 854cm−1 (marked with a dotted line).The IR bands <800cm−1 attributed to the (Co/Fe) OH and (Co/Fe) O vibrations (Fig. 5). All the prepared samples showed a shoulder (marked with a black dot) at 2923cm−1 refers to the hydrogen bonds between water and CO3 2− [31]. The Cu content does not significantly affect the position of the (Co, Cu& Fe) O since CuO, CoO and FeO vibration frequencies are very close. Fig. 6 shows TGA-DSC results for the Co/Fe, 0.35 Cu (Co)/Fe & 0.6 Cu (Co)/Fe −LDH samples. The TGA and DSC scans are relatively the same for all the prepared LDH samples, differing only in the temperatures where the thermal events occur. Generally they exhibited two weight losses. First, in the temperature range of 50–220°C, DSC shows one endothermic peak (accompanied with ∼18% weight loss of all the samples) due to the release of the physisorbed water and the interlamellar water, keeping the layered structure. The intensity of the endothermic peak increases significantly as the copper concentration increases within the lattice. The ΔH value of the dehydration event order as follow: Co/Fe (38J/g) ˂0.35 Cu (Co)/Fe (80J/g) ˂0.6 Cu(Co)/Fe (83J/g) −LDH prepared samples, which suggested that the water dehydration process becomes more difficult as the cobalt being substituted by the copper in the LDH lattice (in other words as the ionic redius increases), confirming the FT-IR data leading the desorption process to become very difficult because of strong hydrogen bonding. In the 2nd step, tests ranging between 220 and 650°C, show an exothermic peak at ∼509°C for Co/Fe, 522°C for 0.35 Cu (Co)/Fe and 521°C for 0.6 Cu (Co)/Fe-LDH samples, (with weight loss=5.92, 6.4& 9.7% for Co/Fe, 0.35 Cu(Co)/Fe & 0.6 Cu(Co)/Fe-LDH samples, respectively), which attributed to the formation of cobalt and or (copper) oxy-carbonate, like phase. The TGA results indicate that the prepared LDH samples are thermally stable at reaction temperatures up to 450°C. From the previous results, it can be stated that the structural and the morphological characterization of the prepared LDH samples emphasized our success in preparing a single pure LDH phase even for a high copper content sample. These prepared LDH samples are pure crystalline layered double hydroxide with large crystal size, having pristine hexagonal plate-like morphology with good quality, the change in their textural parameters is relatively small but the copper insertion within the Co-Fe-DH lattice has a notable impact on the acidic properties which definitely affect their catalytic performance. Also, the prepared LDH samples are thermally stable up to 450°C. 4 Catalytic activity towards toluene conversion Due to its lamellar structure and unique pore size that is comparable to the molecular dimension of mordenite [5], Layered Double Hydroxide samples (LDHs) are prepared to differentiate their catalytic activity towards toluene conversion. Table 4 and Figs. 7–9 present the catalytic performance of Co/Fe, 0.35 Cu (Co)/Fe and 0.6Cu(Co)/Fe-LDH prepared samples for toluene conversion at different reaction temperatures (350–450°C). The results comprise toluene conversion, product yields and the selectivity. The converted products are mainly composed of benzene, xylene and trimethylbenzenes (TMBs) in addition to limited quantity of methanol. It can be established that the presence of xylenes and benzene in the product mixture insures that disproportionation reaction of toluene occurred. On the other hand, the presence of considerable amount of TMBs in the product means that the produced xylenes were successively subjected to transalkylation reaction using methanol present in the stream product to produce TMBs (Scheme 1 ) [32]. This should make Layered Double Hydroxides catalysts with less shape selective properties as far as trimethylbenzenes are concerned 4.1 Effect of reaction temperature and copper content The reaction temperature and the copper content have a significant effect on the toluene conversion. Data in (Fig. 7A) clarify the increase in the catalytic activity of all prepared LDH samples with the increase in the reaction temperature and with the decrease in the copper content (Fig. 7B). The prepared 0.35Cu(Co)/Fe- LDH sample shows a sharp increase in its activity as the reaction temperature increases in the range from 375 to 450°C (the conversion increases sharply from 41 to 99%). Meanwhile, the 0.6 Cu (Co)/Fe- LDH sample shows lower activity at higher reaction temperature, if compared with the prepared Co/Fe-DH sample. The change in the temperature region activation may be attributed to the heterogeneous distribution of the active sites in the prepared sample, i.e., Cu sites and acid sites. The catalytic activity of the prepared Co/Fe-LDH sample increases as the reaction temperature increases to 450°C (the conversion increases from 40 to 60% successively). As well known, toluene disproptionation and transalkylation reactions occurred on both acid sites either Brönsted and or Lewis acid; as consequence, the catalytic activity will mainly depend on the concentration of the acid centers, i.e., as the reaction temperature increases the acid sites differentiate. The results (Table 4 and Fig. 7A&B) indicate a good correlation of the catalytic activity in the transalkylation reaction of toluene with the acidity of the LDH samples measured in terms of number of sites (NH3-TPD results) and also the degree of copper dispersion as confirmed by XRD results and TEM image (Figs. 1 and 2). Although, the acidity of 0.6Cu(Co)/Fe-LDH is higher than that of the prepared Co/Fe-LDH sample, it shows lower catalytic activity in terms of toluene conversion, admitting that the catalytic activity of the prepared 0.6 Cu(Co)/Fe −LDH sample is not related only to the acid properties of the surface but also should take into account consideration the copper dispersion, particle size and the average pore size (Tables 1 and 2) that influence its catalytic activity, causing the products diffusion process becomes rate controlling [33]. Indeed, the overall conversion of toluene, decreases in the following order for a series of LDH catalysts: 0.35Cu (Co)/Fe>Co/Fe>0.6Cu(Co)/Fe, Also, The activity at lower reaction temperature follows the order: 0.35Cu(Co)/Fe=0.6Cu(Co)/Fe<Co/Fe-LDH Whereas the activity at the reaction temperature range 400–450°C follows the order: 0.6Cu(Co)/Fe<Co/Fe<0.35Cu(Co)/Fe-LDH The distribution of the converted products and their yield follow almost the same trend by increasing the reaction temperature over all the layered double hydroxide samples (Fig. 8), regardless the copper content ratio. It can be observed that the disproportionation reaction of toluene to xylenes and benzene is catalyzed at lower reaction temperature (375–400°C) while the transalkylation reaction of toluene to produce TMBs is activated at higher reaction temperatures (400–450°C). The behavior of xylenes production (Fig. 8) is in parallel with the behavior of the benzene production through toluene conversion. Concurrently, TMBs are formed by excessive alkylation during xylene production on all the prepared samples studied without significant differences at all temperatures (350–450°C). The yield of TMBs can be as high as 82% and 69% at 450°C on using 0.35Cu (Co)/Fe-LDH and Co/Fe-LDH catalysts, respectively and shifted to 55% at 450°C using the 0.6Cu (Co)/Fe-LDH catalyst. Data in Table 4 and Fig. 8 reveal that the Cu doping into Co/Fe-LDH lattice by 0.35 improves the total catalytic conversion and enhances the yield of TMBs, Which is correlated well with the proper balance between the increase in total acid concentration and copper dispersion, and this effectively increased the activity towards toluene conversion. And so, it can be concluded that the prepared 0.35Cu (Co)/Fe-LDH sample can, therefore, be considered to be the most active one. On the contrary, a further increase in Cu doping to 0.6 causes a significant decrease in activity at all reaction temperatures. This may be attributed to the increase in particle size that induced poor dispersion, associated with the formation of small distorted octahedral units around copper sites as confirmed by TEM image (Fig. 2C). Also, this behavior influence on the micro-texture of the obtained prepared samples as evidenced from the increase in the micro-pore volume from 0.01 to 0.03cm3/g and the decrease in pore diameter from 3.8 to 3.4nm, means that a certain interaction between the copper and cobalt species occurred resulting in an increase in the average particle size (from 231 to 364nm, DLS results, Table 1), served in pore narrowing, (as established from N2 physisorption results) which causes diffusion restriction to the larger diameter TMBs, since the diffusion rate greatly decreases relative to the rate of the chemical reaction. The diffusion restriction in the catalytic pores of the prepared LDH catalysts increases with the increase in the Cu content, the activation energy of toluene methylation increased and the activation entropy became less negative (DSC results, Fig. 6). This indicates that activation of the current reaction via successive Cu occlusion up to 0.35 over-compensated the diffusion restriction effect. Histogram in Fig. 9 represents that the non-doped Co/Fe and 0.35Cu (Co)/Fe-LDH prepared samples have the lowest selectivity for xylene production. However, the only benefit from increasing the copper doping to 0.6 is an increase in xylene-selectivity by considering the correlation between xylene-selectivity and temperature over the lower temperature range (Histogram in Fig. 9). This means that copper may act as a selective promoter for xylene formation, also imply that the copper in this sample was mostly distributed over the external surface of the LDH rather than being dispersed throughout the channels of the LDH (internal surface) (TEM images). Causing pore narrowing and the bulkier TMBs diffusion become limited. The high Cu dispersion in the channels 0.35Cu (Co)/Fe-LDH (XRD and TEM images) cause a decrease in its xylene production and consequently the xylene selectivity decreased. Moreover, xylenes selectivities depend on the reaction temperature; at higher temperatures, physical rather than chemical effects are accelerated over Co/Fe and 0.35Cu (Co)/Fe-LDH catalysts. Furthermore, the xylene-selectivity over 0.6Cu (Co)/Fe-LDH decreases greatly at temperatures higher than 425°C and it is the least selective at 450°C. That is attributed to the blocking of the acid sites of the catalyst by sintering effect as the methylation reaction of toluene occurs at the acidic sites spread over the channel and the external surface of the sample. This is evident by the large drop of xylene selectivity from 22.5% at 375°C to 11.43% at 450°C over the 0.6 Cu (Co)/Fe-LDH catalyst. Concurrently the selectivity towards xylenes formation is in the order: Co/Fe<0.35Cu(Co)/Fe<0.6Cu(Co)/Fe-LDH It can be observed that the selectivity of trimethyl benzene (TMBs) formation over all the prepared LDH catalysts increases with the increase in the reaction temperature, which goes parallel with the sharp decrease in the selectivity towards xylene formation. The selectivity towards trimethylbenzenes formation follows the order: 0.6Cu (Co)/Fe<0.35Cu(Co)/Fe=Co/Fe-LDH. The acidity differences and copper dispersion within the LDH lattice are the decisive role in the products selectivity as they facilitate the products adsorption to continue the disproportionation and the transalkylation reaction of toluene to form xylenes and TMBs (justifying the results represented in Histogram) (Fig. 9). 4.2 Mathematical modeling for the catalytic toluene conversion Examination trends have revolved around the use of linear estimates and the Excel functions that allow us to measure the accuracy of estimated data from the experimental data. There are five charts based on the experimental data for each product regarding to each catalyst and select the most accurate equation that represent the best fit depends on R2 parameter that is a measure of the error between the data points and the estimated values. Its values vary between 0=no relationship and 1=a perfect relationship. 4.2.1 For Co/Fe-LDH From the charts for the converted products; benzene, xylene, and TMB, and the values of R2 it can be seen that the polynomial equation is the best mathematical relation that represents the three products (Fig. S1, Supplementary material). 4.2.2 For 0.35 Cu(Co)/Fe-LDH Based on R2 value for each product (Fig. S2, Supplementary material), it was found that the best mathematical equation for benzene is EXPONTIONAL, for xylene is POWER, and for TMB is POLYNOMAIL equation. 4.2.3 For 0.6 Cu (Co)/Fe-LDH R2 values of each chart introduced POLYNOMAIL equation as the best mathematical relation that represents this experimental data for all converted products (Fig. S3, Supplementary material). 5 Conclusion The important conclusions derived from the present study can be summarized as follows In this study we utilized the lamellar structure and the unique pore size of Layered Double Hydroxides (LDH) that is comparable to the molecular dimension of mordenite and were investigated as catalysts towards toluene conversion. Co/Fe-LDH was synthesized by simple co-precipitation method. Copper was incorporated into the Co/Fe-LDH lattice with different Cu2+/(Co2+ +Cu2+)=0, 0.35 and 0.6. XRD patterns have shown that Cu species were highly dispersed, as no peaks related to the dopant copper were detected. It was found that upon substitution Co2+ cations with 0.6 Cu2+ cations within the Co/Fe-LDH, a direct influence on the structural, the textural features as well as on the acid strength of the obtained x Cu (Co)/Fe-LDH nanocomposites. The promotion of copper insertion within Co/Fe-LDH lattice with two different concentrations on the toluene conversion reaction was investigated. The converted products were composed of benzene, xylenes insuring the occurrence of toluene disproportionation followed by excessive alkylation of the produced xylene giving rise to transalkylation reactions and trimethylbenzenes (TMBs) are formed, making Layered Double Hydroxides catalysts with less shape selective properties as far as trimethylbenzenes are concerned. The catalytic activity results showed that the acidic strength not only the main factor that influence the catalytic activity of different xCu(Co)/Fe-LDH catalysts towards toluene conversion, but also the copper dispersion and particle size that affect the external surface area and hence the activity. Increasing copper doping by 60%, increased selectivity to xylene production of the 0.6Cu(Co)/Fe-LDH catalyst to a certain extent, however TMB formation was not inhibited. 0.35Cu(Co)/Fe-LDH catalyst was found to be effective in terms of toluene conversion with ∼99% toluene conversion into trimethylbenzenes(TMBs) at 450°C and the selectivity to TMBs that was not temperature dependent reaching ∼93% at 375°C, which may be attributed to the proper balance between its acidity and copper dispersion within the LDH lattice. This sample is considered a potential catalyst for the formation of the industrial petrochemical products. Toluene disproptionation reaction is favored over 0.6 Cu(Co)/Fe −LDH due to diffusion limitation of bulkier TMBs induced by pore narrowing (3.4nm),whereas the transalkylation reaction is favored over 0.35 Cu(Co)/Fe and Co/Fe-LDH at low reaction temperature (375–425°C). From the mathematical modeling, according to the equations controlling the different converted products it was found that the 0.35 Cu(Co)/Fe-LDH catalyst has different equations represented the various converted products, indicating each product has a unique self-feature identity. Table (S4, Supplementary material) summarizes the most accurate mathematical equation that describes the behavior of each product related to the same catalyst and under range of reaction temperatures.

These samples are used as catalysts and their catalytic activity behavior were tested towards toluene conversion at different reaction temperatures (300–450°C) using a fixed bed flow system operated under atmospheric pressure. Characterizations of the prepared materials have been studied by different techniques, N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm, XRD, FT-IR, SEM, TEM and NH3-TPD. The effect of copper incorporation with different Cu2+/(Co2+ +Cu2+)=0, 0.35 and 0.6 on the structural, morphological and catalytic activity were investigated. Significant structural, morphological, acidic strength and catalytic differences were emphasized between the three catalysts. The catalytic activity results clarified that 0.35 Cu(Co)/Fe-LDH sample is an efficient catalyst with ∼99% toluene conversion into trimethylbenzenes(TMBs) at 450°C. The selectivity to TMBs produced product was not temperature dependent reaching ∼93% at 375°C, due to the proper balance between acidity and copper content ratio within the Co/Fe-LDH lattice. The estimated excel equations are adequate and in agreement with the experimental results.",
