Key Laboratory of Mesoscopic Chemistry of Ministry of Education School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering Nanjing University Nanjing 210093 China Graphical abstract Fe3O4 micro-particles encapsulated within silica bearing an outer layer of ordered mesoporous mSiO2-Fe (Fe3O4@SiO2@mSiO2-Fe) were synthesized. The material was a magnetically separable catalyst for the oxidative cracking reaction of styrene to produce benzaldehyde selectively, which was a very important transformation from the industrial viewpoint. Characterizations showed that this material was formed by a typical core-shell structure with uniform hexagonal mesopores possessed high specific surface area. The unique material structure facilitated the adsorption and mass transport of the organic molecules over its surface and enhanced the durability of the materials. Notably, the catalyst allowed the utilization of air as partial oxidant so that the reaction could employ reduced amount of H2O2, leading to an even safer process from large-scale application viewpoint. Keywords Magnetically recyclable catalyst Iron catalyst Oxidative cracking reaction Selective reaction Fine chemical 1 Introduction Oxidative cracking reaction of CC bond is a significant transformation in industry. It has been widely applied in organic synthesis and biomass utilization for allowing the synthesis of carbonyls [1–4], deprotection of the key functional groups [5,6], as well as the degradation of large molecules especially those from the biomass [7,8]. In the field, the selective oxidative cracking reaction of styrene to benzaldehyde is a very practical transformation because it can produce the useful fine chemical benzaldehyde from the abundantly accessible petrochemicals [9–12]. However, although there have been a variety of reports on this transformation, the present technologies suffer quite a lot of drawbacks, such as the use of expensive catalytic metals [13], some of which are very toxic [14], the use of stoichiometric chemical oxidants generating a lot of wastes [15], the unrecyclable catalysts [16], or the high energy consumption processes for using ozone as oxidant [17]. Therefore, developing novel low cost, low waste generation and low energy consumption protocol to achieve the oxidative cracking reaction of styrene is a necessary subject with both academic and industrial meanings. Yet, nano catalysts have attracted broad attention for their ultra-high efficiency leading to the green features of the reaction processes free of ligands or additives [18–23]. In nanocatalysts development, magnetic materials, e.g. Fe3O4, have been used as the catalyst supports endowing the convenient magnetic separation progresses to recover the catalyst much more efficiently [24–26]. On the other hand, mesoporous silica materials are also used in catalyst development to improve the catalyst activity and durability owing to their large specific surface area and pore volume [27,28]. Magnetically separable mesoporous silica materials, combining the advantages of the above two types of materials, might lead to the rapid progress of the industrial catalyst development [29] as well as the drug separation [30]. Recently, we designed and prepared the magnetically recyclable Fe3O4@SiO2@mSiO2-Fe catalyst and employed it in the selective oxidative cracking reaction of styrene to produce benzaldehyde for the first time. Herein, we wish to report our findings. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The reagents and solvents (purities > 99 %) used in this work were all purchased from reagent merchants and directly used without additional purification. The uniform magnetic Fe3O4 particles were prepared via the reference-reported solvothermal method [30]. 0.10 g of Fe3O4 particles were treated with 50 ml of aqueous HCl (0.1 mol/L) under ultrasonication conditions for 10 min. After then, the magnetite particles were washed with distilled water and dispersed in the mixture of 80 mL of ethanol, 20 mL of water, and 1.0 mL of NH3·H2O (28 wt%) via ultrasonication, being followed by the addition of 0.03 g of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS). After vigorous stirring at room temperature for 6 h, the product designated as Fe3O4@SiO2 was separated and washed with ethanol and distilled water. They were then dispersed in the mixture of 0.30 g of hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), 80 mL of distilled water, 60 mL of ethanol, and 1.20 mL of NH3·H2O (28 wt%) with a desired amount of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O. The mixture was vigorously stirred for 0.5 h to form a uniform dispersion and 0.40 g of TEOS was gradually dropped into the system, which was vigorously stirred for another 6 h at 30 °C. The product designated as Fe3O4@SiO2@CTAB/Fe-Si was magnetically separated and was washed with ethanol and distilled water. After being dried in vacuum at 80 °C for 12 h to remove the template of CTAB, and being calcined in air at 500 °C for 5 h, the final product designated as Fe3O4@SiO2@mSiO2-Fe was obtained. 2.2 Catalyst characterization The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all samples were recorded on a Philips X’pert pro diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation (40 kV, 40 mA). Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured at 77 K with a Micromeritics Tristar 3020 analyzer. Before measurement, the samples were degassed in a vacuum at 200 °C for at least 6 h. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method was utilized to calculate the specific surface areas. The pore volumes and pore size distributions were derived from the desorption branches of isotherms using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations were performed on a JEM-2100 (HR) microscope operated at 200 kV. The specimens were prepared by ultrasonically suspending the sample in ethanol and placing a drop of the solution onto a copper grid with an amorphous carbon film. 2.3 Details for the Fe3O4@SiO2@mSiO2-Fe-catalyzed styrene oxidation reaction In a typical experiment, a mixture of styrene (10 mmol), H2O2 (10 mmol, 30 wt%), and catalyst (100 mg) in 10 mL of acetonitrile was introduced into a closed 50 mL regular glass reactor with vigorous stirring (For the photograph of the equipment, please see Supplementary data). The mixture was heated at 60 °C for 10 h and the catalyst could be recovered by magnetic separation. The reaction liquid was analyzed on a gas-chromatograph (GC5890 F) equipped with SE-54 capillary column (25 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm) and a flame ionization detector. Both of the injector and detector temperatures were at 260 °C. The column temperature increased through a temperature-programmed route as follows: with a rate of 5 °C /min from 100 °C to 120 °C for 5 min, and then with a rate of 20 °C /min from 120 °C to 200 °C. The recovered catalyst was washed with acetonitrile, and could be reused in the next turn of reaction. 3 Results and discussions 3.1 Catalyst preparation and characterization Fe3O4@SiO2@mSiO2-Fe composites with Fe/Si molar ratios in the range of 0.05–0.25 were synthesized via the sol-gel method [30]. In the procedure, the Fe3O4 magnetic cores were prepared via the reference-reported solvothermal method [31], being followed by the coating with TEOS to prepare Fe3O4@SiO2. The material was then treated with CTAB and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O to form the Fe-doped mSiO2 outer layer to produce the desired Fe3O4@SiO2@mSiO2-Fe composites. For details of operation, please see section 2.1. The low-angle XRD patterns of the Fe3O4@SiO2@mSiO2-Fe samples with different Fe/Si ratios are given in Fig. 1 , while the detailed structural parameters of the samples are summarized in Table S1 in Supplementary data for reader reference. The characteristic diffraction peak of MCM-41 at ca 2.4° is observed, illuminating the hexagonal mesoporous symmetry of the samples [32]. With the increasing of iron content, the width of the peak was enhanced, while the intensity decreased, reflecting the reduction of hexagonal symmetry in the materials. In the materials with elevated Fe content, Fe3+ gradually replaced Si4+ in the frameworks. The larger ionic radius of Fe3+ versus Si4+ led to the increase in d100 and a0, which were reflected by the shift of diffraction peaks to a lower angle with increased Fe incorporation [33]. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves of the synthesized Fe3O4@SiO2@mSiO2-Fe are shown in Fig. 2 . The samples exhibit typical IV isotherms (Fig. 2A) as defined by Brunauer et al. [34], indicating the mesoporous structure of the sample. The isotherms have sharp inflections in the P/P0 range of 0.20–0.35, which reflect the capillary condensation of N2 within the mesopores. The pore size distribution curves (Fig. 2B) show a sharp peak being centered at a mean value of 2.4 nm, indicating the uniform mesopores of the samples. The BET surface area is also calculated in Table S1. When the Fe/Si molar ratio increased to more than 0.10, the redundant iron species migrated from the framework to the outer surface in the phase of Fe2O3 after being calcined, leading to the blockage of certain pores [33]. This caused the decrease in specific surface areas from 603 m2/g to 492 m2/g. Infrared spectroscopy has been extensively used for the characterization of transition-metal cation-modified molecular sieves. In the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra (Fig. 3 ), the slight red shifts with the increase of iron content in the samples were found for the band at ca 1090 cm−1, corresponding to the stretching vibration of the tetrahedral SiO4 units. These shifts indicated that hetero atoms were incorporated into the framework of mSiO2, and the M-O-Si bonds were formed. By contrast, this phenomenon did not exist for the bands at approximately 470 cm−1, which corresponded to the bending vibration of surface Si-O-H. The morphological and structural features of Fe3O4@SiO2@mSiO2-Fe with the Fe/Si molar ratio at 0.10 were examined via TEM (Fig. 4 ). The material possesses a typical core-shell structure, in which the magnetic cores are formed by black spheres with an average size of ca 240 nm, while the mesoporous mSiO2-Fe shell is illustrated in gray color with an average thickness of ca 20 nm. The ordered pore structure of the mesoporous shell can be observed clearly in TEM spectra, and it is in good agreement with the low-angle XRD results. 3.2 Catalytic activity tests A series of Fe3O4@SiO2@mSiO2-Fe catalysts with different Fe/Si molar ratios were tested in the oxidative cracking reaction of styrene and the results were summarized in Fig. 5 . In the reactions, the benzaldehyde selectivity fluctuated around ca 84 %. The conversion of styrene was enhanced with the iron content increasing and reached the peak at the point of Fe/Si = 0.10. The precipitated iron oxides blocking up the mesoporous channels of the catalyst might be the possible reason for the catalytic activity decreasing. The reaction conditions were optimized and the results of parallel experiments were illustrated in Fig. 6 . With the elevated reaction temperature, the styrene conversion increased, but benzaldehyde selectivity decreased on the contrary (Fig. 6A). When the reaction temperature increased from 40 °C to 60 °C, the conversion rate of styrene increased from 10.1%–52.8%, while the selectivity of benzaldehyde decreased from 99 % to 84.9 %. Meanwhile, the selectivity of epoxidation and isomerization by-products increased with elevated reaction temperature. The results showed that styrene was more likely to undergo the oxidative CC bond breaking under mild conditions, while the generation of epoxide by-products elevated at high temperature [35]. The decrease of styrene conversion at the temperature over 70 °C might be attributed to the decomposition of H2O2, which was also the reason for the reduced benzaldehyde selectivity and elevated epoxide generation, because the oxidative cracking reaction required even more H2O2 amount than the epoxidation [36]. In previous works, it was demonstrated that the oxidative cracking reaction of alkenes occurred via an epoxidation step as well as the successive hydroxylation/dehydration steps producing the epoxide and hyacinthin by-products, which were further oxidized into benzaldehyde [36]. This could be reflected by the results of the reaction time investigation experiments illustrated in Fig. 6B, in which the benzaldehyde selectivity slightly increased with prolonged reaction time, while the selectivities of epoxide and hyacinthin decreased contrarily. The smooth conversion of styrene led to the elevated benzaldehyde yield along with the proceeding reaction time (Fig. 6B). With the elevating H2O2 amount, both styrene conversion and benzaldehyde selectivity increased (Fig. 6C). Interestingly, although the oxidative cracking reaction of alkenes required at least 2 equivalents of H2O2 according to the theoretical calculation with the reaction equation, in this Fe3O4@SiO2@mSiO2-Fe-catalyzed reaction, only one equivalent of H2O2 was enough to afford more than 80 % styrene conversion, showing that air may participate the reaction as an additional oxidant. The phenomenon was probably attribute the use of Fe as an oxygen-carrier catalyst, which could allow the utilization of air as terminal oxidant, as reported by the literatures [37,38]. Bearing a magnetic Fe3O4 core, the Fe3O4@SiO2@mSiO2-Fe catalyst is magnetically separable and can be reused in next turn of reaction. It can be reused for at least 5 times and in the reactions (Table 1 ), the selectivities of the benzaldehyde product and styrene epoxide and hyacinthin by-products were generally unchanged, while the styrene conversions were slightly decreased. The slightly decreased catalytic activity after use was probably due to residual organics being absorbed on the material surface blocking the active sites. Therefore, reactivation the catalyst after use by calcination to remove the absorbed organic residues might be required and it could obviously enhance the catalyst activity, leading to 51.5 % of the styrene conversion ratio with 83.2 % of the benzaldehyde selectivity. 4 Conclusions In conclusion, novel Fe3O4@SiO2@mSiO2-Fe was developed for the selective oxidative cracking reaction of styrene to produce benzaldehyde, which was an important transformation in industrial production. Bearing a magnetic Fe3O4 and with the mesoporous silica outer-layer that could well protect the catalytic Fe centers, the catalyst was magnetically separable and could be reused without obvious deactivation. The use of Fe as the catalytic metal not only reduced the cost of the catalyst, but also allowed the utilization of air as partial oxidant so that the amount of H2O2 could be reduced, leading to a much safer approach for the transformation from large-scale application viewpoint.
