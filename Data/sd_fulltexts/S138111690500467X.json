Graphical abstract New dimeric cinchona salts were synthesized and used as efficient chiral phase transfer catalysts for the synthesis of enantioselective alkylation of N-(diphenylmethylene)glycine tert-butyl ester giving very good chemical yield and ee's. New dimeric cinchona quaternary ammonium salts have been synthesized and used as efficient chiral phase transfer catalysts for enantioselective alkylation of N-(diphenylmethylene)glycine tert-butyl ester giving very good chemical yield and up to 99% enantiomeric excess. The catalytic efficiency was compared with the previously reported single site chiral phase transfer catalysts. Keywords Enantioselection Dimeric catalyst Cinchona alkaloid Phase transfer catalyst Schiff base 1 Introduction Phase transfer catalysis (PTC) is a very useful approach that typically involves simple experimental operations, mild reaction conditions, inexpensive, environmentally benign reagents and solvents and large-scale reactions [1]. From the original work of Makosza and Serafinowa [2] and the pioneering efforts of Starks [3] to the asymmetric advances of O’Donnell et al. [4], phase transfer catalysis has played a great role in organic synthesis [5]. The PTC systems have several advantages over single-phase systems including improved reaction rates, lower reaction temperature and absence of expensive anhydrous or aprotic solvents. Achiral phase transfer catalysts can be utilized to synthesize various types of amino acids. Thus, the most promising and widely used methods for the synthesis of α-amino acid derivatives involve the enantioselective alkylation of glycine imine (a Schiff base) with the corresponding alkyl halide under PTC conditions [6]. In addition, many other processes [6f] such as Michael addition [7a–c], Darzen's reaction [7d], epoxidation [7e–g], aldol condensation [7h–j] and fluorination [7k–m] have been studied recently under chiral phase transfer catalytic (CPTC) conditions. There are several CPTC, viz. spiro-ammonium [8] and phosphonium salts [9], TADDOL [10], binaphthyl derived amines [10b,11] and salen–metal complexes [12] used for the asymmetric synthesis of α-amino acids. Cinchona alkaloid derived quaternary ammonium salts were used as chiral PTC due to their ready availability, low cost and their effectiveness as CPTCs [6]. The synthesis of mono-substituted α-amino acid derivatives via asymmetric phase-transfer catalysed alkylation of N-(diphenylmethylene)glycine tert-butyl ester 3 (Scheme 1 ) has been known for some time. The preparation of chiral compounds from achiral substrates with chiral catalysts under PTC condition is a powerful synthetic method for asymmetric synthesis [8a] in which there have been several notable successes [13–16]. Since the first cinchona alkaloid-type PTC 1a was introduced by O’Donnell et al. [4], more efficient catalysts 2a and 2b have been developed independently by Lygo et al. [17a] and Corey et al. [17b,c] by introduction of bulky substituents, viz. N-9-anthracenylmethyl group instead of the benzyl group in 1 (Fig. 1 ). Based on the fact that the introduction of a bulky subunit at N1 of cinchona alkaloid leads to an enhancement of the stereoselectivity, recently dimeric [18] and trimeric [19] cinchona derived catalysts were reported for improved enantioselectivity for the alkylation of glycine imine 3. Further, polymer supported cinchonidine and cinchonine ammonium salts were employed as recoverable PTC catalysts [20]. The R and S isomers formation of alkylated products would solely depend on chiral transfer between substrate and catalysts. Systematic literature survey reveals that so far very few reports are available in the enantioselective synthesis of α-amino acids. Further, the catalytic abilities of these catalysts were studied using higher amount of aqueous base to carry out various organic reactions; such a reaction condition is not environmentally acceptable owing to heavy base pollution. It may be expected that the number of active site present per molecule should enhance its catalytic efficiency of reaction yield and ee's. Considering all the early studies, we have synthesized new soluble dimeric chiral phase transfer catalysts (DCPTC) 9 and 11 derived from cinchona alkaloid as a chiral precursor and its catalytic efficiency was studied by the enantioselective alkylation of N-(diphenylmethylene)glycine tert-butyl ester 3 under mild reaction conditions. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials 1,4-Dibromobutane (Merck), cinchonine (Fluka), cinchonidine (Fluka), acetonitrile (AR), dimethylformamide (AR), ethanol (AR), methanol (AR), sodiumborohydride (AR) and triethylamine (Merck). IR spectra were recorded on a JASCO-FT-IR model 5300 spectrometer using KBr pellet. 1H NMR (300 and 200MHz) and 13C NMR (75 and 50MHz) spectra were recorded in CDCl3 on a Bruker AC-200 spectrometer using TMS as internal standard. Elemental analyses were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 240-CHN analyzer. Optical rotations were measured with an Autopol II-automatic polarimeter at room temperature. For TLC analysis, plates coated with silica gel were run in benzene/methanol mixture and spots were developed in the iodine chamber. For column chromatographic separations under gravity, column silica gel (100–200 mesh) was employed. 2.2 1,8-[N,N′-Bis-(4-bromobutyl)-5,5,7,12,12,14-hexamethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane] 5,5,7,12,12,14-Hexamethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraza-tricyclo[9.3.1.14,8]hexadecane 6 (10g, 0.03mol) was dissolved in acetonitrile (30mL) and 1,4-dibromobutane (13.99g, 0.066mol) was rapidly added. This solution was stirred at room temperature (25°C) for 3 days and the white precipitate formed was filtered, washed with small quantity of acetonitrile and dried under vacuum. This crude product 1,8-[N,N′-bis-(4-bromobutyl)-5,5,7,12,12,14-hexamethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane] was recrystalised from water to give white crystals.

The selected results are given in Table 1. The enantioselectivities of the alkylated products 4 were determined by chiral HPLC. The corresponding amino acids were generally obtained in very good chemical yield and ee's (Table 1, entries a–z, x1 and y1). In all cases, the ee's were determined by HPLC analyses [20,21]. When the cinchonine derived catalyst 9a was employed as a CPT catalyst for the alkylation of 3, the reaction showed a lower enantiomeric efficiency of the alkylated product (R)-4 than when performed in the presence of 9b as a CPT catalyst (Table 1, entries a, b, e, f, i, j, m, n, q, s, u, w) due to the formation of hydrogen bond between the enolate of glycine-imine ester 3 and free –OH present in C9 (O) position of the DCPT catalyst (Scheme 3 , 9c); hence, the formation of ion pair interaction between the enolate of the substrate and R4N+ of the DCPTC hardly occurred. So very low chemical yield and ee's were observed. But the C9 (O)-allylated cinchona salts 9b resulted in higher chemical yield as well as the ee's due to the formation of higher induction between the enolate of the substrate and R4N+ of the DCPT catalyst, i.e. the carbocation of the alkyl halide is brought closely at a bonding distance due to the electrostatic attraction of the positively charged nitrogen of the catalyst and the negatively charged glycine imine. The same trend was also found for the alkylation of glycine-imine tert-butyl ester 3 using cinchonidinium salts 11a and 11b as a DCPT catalysts (Table 1, entries c, d, g, h, k, l, o, p, r, t, v, x). With the monomeric catalysts 1a and 2a much lower yields and enantioselectivities were obtained (Table 1, entries y and z). Further, the newly synthesized DCPT catalysts were compared with the previously reported dimeric catalysts 2c and 2d (Fig. 1) [18] under identical reaction conditions. The obtained yield and ee's are higher than those of the 2c and 2d DCPTCs due to the steric hindrence being minimized (Table 1, entries x1 and y1). It is known that quaternary ammonium salts derived from cinchona bases suffer base-induced alterations under PTC conditions. In order to maintain their structural integrity, O-allylated derivatives have been prepared and they have often provided high enantioselectivity for the alkylation of glycine imine. From the obtained results, the newly synthesized DCPTCs 9b and 11b are considered to be the best catalysts for the alkylation of glycine imine under the condition of low base concentrations (20%, w/v). The predominant formation of alkylated products with R and S enantiomers is strongly dependent on the respective nature of the two pseudoenantiomeric catalysts such as 9 and 11, respectively (Table 1, entries a–z). Thus, for the cinchonium and cinchonidinium salts, the molecular assembly during chiral transmission would consist of a contact ion pair formed between the positively charged quaternary nitrogen and the carbanion of the glycine imine with the quinoline part of the former serving as the platform for the aromatic ring of the latter (Scheme 3). There are two most important directions possible for the formation of higher chemical yield and ee such as directions A and B as shown in Scheme 3. The direction A seems to be most preferred for the ion pair interaction between the R4N+ of the catalyst and enolate of the substrate [22]. The direction B could be less favored due to the steric hindrance between the quinoline part of the cinchona alkaloid and the cyclam group of the catalyst. Further, the dramatic increase in the enantioselectivity for the DCPTC catalysts 9b and 11b implies that the cinchona alkaloid moieties and cyclam groups are located near the B site and that the E-enolate of 3 forms an ion pair with 9b and 11b from the less hindered direction A (Scheme 3). Furthermore, we expect that as the re-face of the enolate can be effectively blocked by the formation of the ion pair, and hence the alkyl halide can interact only at the si-face of E-enolate to give the R and S forms, respectively [18,23]. 4 Conclusion In conclusion, we prepared cinchona alkaloid based new dimeric chiral phase transfer catalysts 9 and 11 and confirmed by various spectral techniques. These catalysts are more effective for the alkylation of enantioselctive glycine-imine tert-butyl ester under lower basic conditions. References [1] (a) E.V. Dehmlow S.S.
