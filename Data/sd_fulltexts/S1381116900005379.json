Tel.: +86-22-27404026; fax: +86-22-23358329 A novel process has been developed for synthesis of the silica supported dicopper(II) complex catalyst in which one Cu atom exchanging with two ion exchange sites on the surface of silica. The material was synthesized by reaction of NaOEt modifying the silica surface with dicopper(II) complex [Cu2(μ-Cl)2](ClO4)2·8H2O synthesized as pre-catalyst. The structure of the catalyst has been characterized comparatively with the dicopper(II) complex by element analysis, IR spectra and electronic spectra. The reaction of CO2 with EO (ethylene oxide) has been investigated by temperature programmed desorption and in situ IR spectroscopy. TPD and IR results indicated that CO2 and EO can be chemisorbed on the surface of the catalyst reversibly and desorbed at 393 and 378K, respectively. TPSR-MS experiments have shown that EO desorbed dissociatively at high-temperature to form desorbed CO and CH4 species. CO2 and EO react on the surface in the temperature range of 353–397K. In TPSR-IR investigation, EC (ethylene carbonate) produced was detected at 353K, which is lower than the reported temperature of 393K for homogeneous catalytic reaction. Keywords Dicopper(II) complexes Silica carrier Supported catalyst Carbon dioxide chemisorption Ethylene oxide chemisorption Synthesis of ethylene carbonate 1 Introduction Synthesis of five-membered cyclic carbonates directly from CO2 and oxirane is an important subject since the activation and utilization of CO2 are critical for the substitution of toxic species such as phosgene and isocyanates [1] involved in this reaction. These carbonates can be used as aprotic polar solvent, source for polymer synthesis [2] and synthesis of lithium rich graphite intercalation compounds [3]. Many transition metal complexes are known to catalyze the oxirane-CO2 reaction [4–6] in which metal ions ready to accept oxygen atoms are the active centers for the catalytic reaction. Meanwhile alkali metal halides [7] are also active catalysts because halide anions are the key element for activation of oxiranes. In our investigation, both virtues of these two types of catalysts are combined to design Cl−-bridged dicopper(II) complex and thus, grafted on the surface of silica. The chemisorption properties of both CO2 and EO on the catalyst are investigated thoroughly and the reactivity of the reactants was studied by TPD, TPSR-MS and TPSR-IR techniques. 2 Experimental 2.1 Material and equipment Silica used as supporting material, was washed in 1N HNO3, H2O three times and dried at 473K under vacuum (24h). Other materials used were purchased from Peking Chemical Company and of analytical grade. Metal contents were determined by EDTA titration. The infrared spectra were recorded with a Perkin-Elmer IR spectrophotometer, Model 983G, using KBr-disks. Electronic spectra (in methanol) were measured on a shimdze UV-240 spectrophotometer. Solution electrical conductivity measurements were made with a DDS-11A conductometer. TPD product were detected with a quadruple mass spectrometer, Model LZL-203. 2.2 Preparation of [Cu2(μ-Cl)2](ClO4)2·8H2O To a solution of Cu(ClO4)2·6H2O (1mmol) in methanol (10ml) was added solid state NaCl (1mmol) and magnetically stirred for 2h, then a yellow-green solution and the same colored crystal were obtained. The final product was separated, washed with absolute methanol and diethyl ether three times and dried in vacuum to give a satisfactory analysis data. 2.3 Preparation of silica supported catalyst Cu2(II)(μ-Cl)2/SiO2 To a solution of 44.8ml ethanol containing 12.8mmol NaOEt, 8g SiO2 carrier (350m2 g−1 BET area) was added. After reaction for 2h at ca. 333K protected by purging dinitrogen, 3.2mmol [Cu2(μ-Cl)2](ClO4)2·8H2O was added. After stirring for 2h, the white colored silica changed into green and the green colored solution changed into colorless. Then the catalyst synthesized was filtered, washed by EtOH for three times and dried in vacuum at 353K. 2.4 TPSR-IR experiments The catalyst was grinded into powder under 2μm, and dispersed on KBr wafer, which were loaded into a controlled atmosphere of copper IR cell with KBr windows. The sample was pre-treated by heating to 373K under vacuum (0.1Pa). Spectra of samples with adsorbed CO2 or EO were taken after exposure of samples to 0.5mmol CO2 or EO gas for 2h and then cleared the excess gas under vacuum of 0.1Pa. The same process was used in the TPSR-IR experiment, when CO2 and EO were co-adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst. The IR spectra were monitored in the range of 273–433K. 2.5 TPD and TPSR-MS experiments In the TPD experiment, 500mg catalyst was loaded in a quartz micro-reactor and the two sides were stuffed by asbestos fiber. Before the adsorption of CO2 and EO, the catalyst was treated by heating to 373K under vacuum (1×10−4 Pa) for 2h. The adsorption was performed at 298K by injection of 0.5mmol of CO2 or EO. After 2h, excess amount of CO2 or EO was removed by evacuation to 1×10−4 Pa. The catalyst was ramped as a linear heating rate of 8Kmin−1. The desorbed gases were analyzed by a quadruple mass spectrometer at m/e=44 (for CO2 and EO are the same), m/e=28 and 16, respectively. TPSR-MS was performed in the same condition and the samples were treated with mixture of CO2 and EO (0.5mmol, respectively). The observed intensity for CO2 and EO were analyzed with respect to elucidate the surface reaction definitely. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Surface structure of Cu2(μ-Cl)2/SiO2 Titration analysis data indicated that the ratio of Cu:Cl is equal to 1:1 (Table 1 ) and the molar conductance value for the solution resulted when the catalyst was treated with four equivalent of HClO4 fall in the range of 1:2 electrolyte. In IR spectra of the catalyst (Fig. 1 ), a strong band at 800cm−1 was found, which was assigned to the CuOSi vibration, no bands at 1100 and 630cm−1 expected for the ClO4 − group was detected in the spectra of the catalyst indicating that the ion exchange process has taken placed. Bands at 420 and 470cm−1 were ascribed to CuClCu structure of the dicopper(II) complex, however, they split to quadruple peaks in the spectra of the catalyst when coupling with the vibration of silica (460cm−1) in this region. The electronic spectra of the dicopper(II) complex and the catalyst are given as Fig. 2 . A weak and broad band at ca. 675nm was discovered for the both samples. The profiles of the two envelopes are very similar indicating that the copper(II) ions are sited in the same co-ordination environment. In high-energy, band at 300nm was attributed to LMCT of O→Cu for curve a. Meanwhile band at 235nm of curve b could be assigned to the SiO→Cu transfer. Based on the discussion above, the complex catalyst was proposed to have bis-μ-Cl−-bridged dicopper(II) structure with Cu(II) anchoring on silica in bidentate fashion. The formation of the catalyst could be interpreted as Scheme 1 . 3.2 Chemisorption state of CO2 Fig. 3 shows the IR spectra of CO2 adsorbed on the catalyst. In curve c band at 680cm−1 was attributed to CO2, which shifted to 660cm−1 in adsorption state spectra (curve b) suggesting that CO2 was chemisorbed on the catalyst. In curve b, bands at 1120 and 960cm−1 were ascribed to bridged adsorption state of CO2 [8–10]. Band at 800cm−1 (in curve a) splits to double peaks of 805 and 795cm−1 (in curve b) indicating that the SiOCu group participates the chemisorption process. Fig. 4 shows the trace of CO2 and CO desorbed from the catalyst following the CO2 adsorption. For m/e=44, two peaks were discovered at 393 and 473K, respectively. The former is more intense than the later one, and there is no coverage between the two peaks suggesting that there exist two types of CO2 chemisorption state on the surface of the catalyst. When monitored at m/e=28, no CO were detected, presented that when CO2 desorbed from the surface, CO2 did not undergoes decomposing process. Based on the discussion above, at low-temperature a reversible adsorption state was proposed (Fig. 5 ). The high-temperature TPD-MS band revealed could be attributed to the formation of a more stable bridged adsorption state. 3.3 Chemisorption state of EO IR spectra of EO adsorbed on the catalyst were presented in Fig. 6 . In curve b, the feature band of EO at 860cm−1 shifted to 890cm−1 suggesting that EO undergoes chemisorption process (at high-energy, bands of 3020 and 1642cm−1 shifted to 2980 and 1640cm−1, respectively, not given). Bands at 1260cm−1 denoting the inner-cyclic CO band disappeared in absorption state spectra Fig. 6(a), indicating that EO undergoes cyclic opening process on the surface. A new band at 1100cm−1 (curve a) was found, which could be attributed to CO vibration. Also in curve a, the characteristics of CuClCu vibration (400–800cm−1) changed significantly when compared with the IR spectra of the catalyst, suggesting that the Cu2 unit participate the chemisorption process. In the activation of EO, both reversible adsorption process of EO on metal catalyst [11,12] and ring opening reaction of EO on oxygen covered metal catalyst [13,14] have been reported. In our work, the TPD-MS profiles of desorption products are shown in Fig. 7 . In the spectra of m/e=44, two peaks were observed at around 378 and 468K. When monitored at m/e=28 and 16, respectively, the TPD profiles reveals that at high-temperature CO and CH4 were produced. This phenomenon suggested that there exist two different chemisorption states of EO on the surface of the catalyst. In the low-temperature EO molecules desorbed from the surface reversibly. At high-temperature EO undergoes decomposing process. Since halide anions atom is the best candidate to attack EO [15] and copper(II) ions is ready to co-ordinated with O− thus, formed. The reversible adsorption state was proposed as Fig. 8 . The high-energy peak of m/e=44 TPD-MS curve is tentatively assign to the deep bonding species of EO with the surface complex (may form bridging structure). 3.4 TPSR-MS results Although the quadruple mass spectrometer used in this study could not detect products more then m/e=60, and the product formed could not be monitored directly, however, the surface reaction profile monitored at m/e=44 present the interaction behavior of CO2 and EO (they both have the same m/e value). Fig. 9 A shows the TPSR profile monitored at m/e=44 in the temperature range of 273–573K. Two single peaks at 393 and 573K were observed (curve d). Since intensity of the low-temperature peak is lower than that of either CO2 (curve b) or EO (curve c) and much lower than the plus of these two peaks (curve a), the chemisorbed molecules of the two reactants must react each other. Quantitative analysis is presented in Fig. 9B. In the low-temperature (283–463K) about 68% of adsorbed reactants have reacted each other. The formation of EC was identified by GC method. Significantly, for the high-temperature peak (473K) the pseudo-plused intensity (curve a) is almost equal to the real profile (curve b), indicating that at high-energy the desorbed species are not ready to react each other. This result is consistent with the decomposed desorption process discussed in Section 3.3. 3.5 TPSR-IR experiments The reactivity of CO2 with EO was investigated by in situ IR technique. Fig. 10 a shows the IR spectra of CO2 and EO co-adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst. Bands at 1120, 960 and 660cm−1 represent the adsorption state of CO2, while bands at 1090 and 860cm−1 were assigned to EO adsorbed on the surface. This result indicated that CO2 and EO undergo competitive adsorption process. Fig. 10b–e represents the reaction process upon heating the catalyst in the range of 293–413K. With the increase of the temperature, new bands at 1760, 1480, 1380, 1160, 1060 and 760cm−1 revealed. All these bands are characteristic of ethylene carbonate. 3.6 Discussion of the reaction mechanism Based on the discussion above, a typical mechanism for the catalytic reaction is indicated in Scheme 2 . When the reactants were mixed and purged on the surface of the catalyst, the essential steps involve: 1. two kinds of molecules may chemisorbed on the same Cu2 unit, since it is bridged by bis-chloro ligands; 2. in the temperature from 373 to 393K, both CO2 and EO were activated on the surface, thus, forming the transition state; 3. essentially, halides anions showed considerable nucleophilicity and leaving ability in synthesis of EC [7]. It is reasonable that the CCl bonds breaks off prior that of the CuO band; 4. after the ring forming process, the carbonate molecules leave the Cu2 unit and leave the initial catalyst ready to achieve another catalytic cycle.
