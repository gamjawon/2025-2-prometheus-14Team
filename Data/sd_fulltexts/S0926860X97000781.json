Physical characterization of the solids was carried out by XRD, IR, N2 adsorption, and 27A1 and 71Ga MAS-NMR. n-Heptane cracking (T=350; PN,/P,,cT=4; P=I atm) was used as a model reaction to characterize the acidity of the catalysts. Propane aromatization (T-53@C; P= 1 atm) was used to characterize the acid or the bifunctional behavior of solids. Results show that steaming produces less acid solids due to degalliation and dealumination of the zeolite structure. Because the presence of steam reduces the temperature at which the formation of extra framework gallium species occurs, bifunctional \"Ga203\"/H-[Ga, A1]-ZSM-5 catalysts are formed at lower temperature (T=530'~C) in comparison when calcination is carried out under dry air. Catalysts are less selective to BTX as steaming temperature increases because of a strong reduction of Bronsted acid sites. :~ 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction Thermal treatment with dry air at relatively low temperatures (500<T<600) of ammoniacal MFI- gallosilicates and galloaluminosilicates, synthesized by conventional methods, results in solids only with acid properties when evaluated as aromatization cat- alysts of light paraffins [1-3].

Similar results are obtained when as-synthesized alkali-free gallosilicates or galloaluminosilicates are calcined under dry air. However, in these cases, the formation of the acid or the bifunctional catalyst occurs directly, in one step [4-6], being thus excluded some calcina- tion and exchange steps which must be carried out 0926-860X/97/$17.00 .:~\" 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

This paper shows that calcination, under steaming, of as-synthesized alkali- free galloaluminosilicates, significantly reduces the temperature necessary to obtain bifunctional catalysts (T-530. This is due to a considerable degalliation of the zeolite structure. However, at higher temperatures (T>600) low selective solids are obtained in the aromatization due to a significant decrease in the number of tetrahedral atoms of Ga/u.c. and specially of A1/u.c. 2. Experimental Three samples of as-synthesized alkali-free TPA, MeNH3-[Gao.99Alt.99]-ZSM-5 (Si/Al+Ga=32.2) zeo- lite [5] were steamed in shallow bed (0.5 cm), in a flow reactor, during 3 h (PH20=0.91 atm; P~ir=0.09 atm; flow rate per gram of catalyst=2 ml min-l) at 530 (St-530), 550 (St-550), and 600 (St-600). Addi- tionally, one sample of the same as-synthesized alkali- free zeolite was calcined under dry air at 550 (C-550) and used as a reference. The samples were characterized by XRD, FT-IR, N2 adsorption, and 27A1 and 71Ga MAS-NMR (Table 1). n-Heptane cracking (T=350; P=I atm; N2/ nc7=4) was used as a model reaction to characterize the acidity of catalysts. Propane (C3) aromatization (T--530, Pc3=l atm) was used as a model reaction to evaluate the acidic or the bifunctional behavior of the solids. Catalytic properties of solid obtained by steaming were compared with those of a conventional 1 wt%Ga/H-[Gao.97A11.99]-ZSM-5 catalyst prepared through impregnation of C-550 with 1 wt% of gal- lium. Catalytic tests were conducted in a fixed-bed microreactor, under dynamic flow conditions. Activ- ities were calculated for conversion below 20%. Dif- ferent degrees of propane conversion were obtained by changing space velocity. 3. Results and discussions Table 1 clearly shows that steaming of as-synthe- sized alkali-free TPA, MeNH3 [Gao.99All.99]-ZSM-5 does not produce significant changes in their crystal- linity. Relative crystallinity, determined through XRD [11], CXRD, the ratio of optical densities of IR bands located at 550 and 450 cm-1 [12], I55o/I45o, and the specific surface, S, are similar for all solids. However, the amounts of Ga and A1 present by unit cell, Ga/u.c. and A1/u.c., determined through MAS-NMR [13], show a significant degalliation and dealumination process. Degalliation rate is much higher than deal- umination rate [6] and this phenomenon is stressed by the increase in temperature (Table 1). Steaming at 600 produces almost total degalliation of the solid and only 50% of dealumination (St-600) (Table 1). The calcined solid, under dry air in the absence of steam, (C-550), shows a crystallinity degree similar to that of the starting zeolite. Moreover, C-550 basically possesses the same number of gallium and aluminum atoms per unit cell (Table 1), which indicates that under these calcination conditions there is no de- Table 1 Characterization of the solids Sample CXgDa /550]/450b S (m2 g 1)c Ga/u.c.d A1/u.c.e TPA,MeNH3- [Gao 99A11.99]-ZSM-5 100 0.80 -- 0.99 1.99 C-550 99 0.78 412 0.97 1.97 St-530 96 0.80 393 0.12 1.29 St-550 90 0.80 369 0.05 0.99 St-600 89 0.76 366 0.03 0.88 1 wt%Ga/H- [Gao.97Al1.99] -ZSM-5 105 0.8 425 0.97 1.99 aRelative crystallinity by XRD [11]. bRatio of the optical densities of the bands located at 550 and 450 cm i [12].

Catalyst acidity, determined using n-heptane crack- ing as a model reaction (Table 2) shows that the solid calcined under dry air at 550 (C-550) is more active than steamed solids (St-530, St-550, and St-600). Moreover, their activity decreases as the treatment temperature increases. This activity decrease in the n- heptane cracking should be related to the reduction in active acidic sites of catalysts, produced by partial degalliation and/or dealumination of the zeolite struc- ture, as shown by the results obtained by 71Ga and 27A1 MAS-NMR (Table 1). As has been reported else- where [4,5,8] the introduction of gallium into an acid zeolite does not modify the acidity of the zeolite. In fact, C-550 and 1 wt%Ga/H-[Ga0.97All.99]-ZSM-5 present the same activity in n-heptane cracking. Despite the significant changes produced by the temperature of steaming, both in the number of gal- lium and aluminum atoms present in the zeolite structure (Table 1) as well as in the activity in n- heptane cracking (Table 2), global activity of solids in propane transformation does not significantly change, except when steaming temperature reaches 600 (St- 600). Nevertheless selectivity of the reaction radically changes as steaming temperature increases. BTX/light products molar ratio (light products=methane, ethane, ethene) reaches a maximum value for St-530 and is very small for St-600 (Table 2). Moreover, the activity and the selectivity of St-530 is very similar to that of conventional bifunctional 1 wt%Ga]H-[Gao.97All.99]- ZSM-5 catalyst (Table 2). The highest selectivity to BTX of St-530 with respect to C-550 can be explained by the appearing of extraframework gallium species (EFGS) as a result of partial degalliation of zeolite structure, due to steaming, with the subsequent formation of a bifunc- tional catalyst 0.425 \"Ga203\"/H1.41-[Gao.12Al|.29]- ZSM-5 (assuming that extraframework aluminum species do not take part in the reaction as catalysts). These EFGS catalyze the limiting step of the aroma- c3..= c0.c9 1 I LOWER / 1' J 2 3 [A~ H+ H+II 4 .+116 C6_C8 NAPHTHENES f C~-Cs AROMATICS Scheme 1.

An increase in the steaming temperature (St-550 and St-660) stresses the degalliation and deal- umination process (Table 1), drastically reducing the total number of acidic sites present in the zeolite structure and thus the activity in the n-heptane crack- ing (Table 2). However this reduction in the total number of acidic sites also reduces BTX production, because in spite of the increase in the dehydrogenating capacity of solids (D/BTX) (defined as the molar ratio between propene fraction and the aromatic product produced in the reaction, D/BTX, St-550:D/ BTX=5.8; St-600:D/BTX=26.4) (Table 2), they do not posses enough acidic sites for intermediate oligomerization, cracking and cyclization stages (Steps 2-6, Scheme 1) to occur, necessary for the production of aromatic products. The presence of steam during calcination of as- synthesized alkali-free [Ga,A1]-ZSM-5 zeolites sig- nificantly reduces the temperature necessary to obtain bifunctional \"Ga203\"/H-[Ga,A1]-ZSM-5 catalysts, reducing also the temperature from 700 (under dry air) [4-6] to 530 in the presence of steam. 4. Conclusions Steaming of an as-synthesized alkali-free [Ga,AI]- ZSM-5 zeolite leads to bifunctional catalysts (\"Ga203\"/H-[Ga,A1]-ZSM-5) for the reaction of pro- pane aromatization at temperatures much lower than those which are necessary when calcination is carried out under dry air. Steaming temperatures equal to or higher than 600 result in strongly dehydrogenating solids incapable of producing aromatic compounds. All these results are due to a pronounced degalliation and dealumination of the solid, produced by the steaming process. References [1] J. Kanai, N. Kawata, Appl. Catal. 55 (1989) 115, Appl.
