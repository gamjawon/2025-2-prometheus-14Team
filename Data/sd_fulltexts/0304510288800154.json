TEMPESTI, L. GIUFFRE, F. DI RENZO, C. MAZZOCCHIA and G. MODICA Dipartimento di Chimica Industrials, Politecnico di Milano, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, Milan 20133 (Italy) (Received July 21, 1987; accepted October 21,1987) Summary The catalytic epoxidation of cyclohexene has been studied in the liquid phase using as catalysts molybdenum-boron mixed oxo derivatives sup- ported on new polymeric resins. The binary system catalysts, in which the formation of B O Mo chemical bonds is suggested on the basis of spectral data, retain constant activity when recycled. Relative to conventional homogeneous molybdenum catalysts, no chemical degradation is observed. Introduction High-valent d transition metal complexes such as Mo(VI), V(V), Ti(IV) are effective catalysts for the selective epoxidation of olefins by alkyi hydroperoxides (eqn. I): RO,H + )=( -N- ROH . )/-0-\\( (1) This reaction has been known since 1965 [I], and has been developed into a commercial process for the manufacture of propylene oxide by Halcon [2] (M=Mo) and by Shell [3] (M=Ti). In the latter case the catalyst is as selective as the best homogeneous catalysts and has the added advantage of being eminently suitable for continuous fixed-bed operation, since it is perfectly insoluble in the reaction medium. On the other hand many attempts have been made in order to hetero- genize more conventional molybdenum catalysts. Apparently when a chemical combination of molybdenum with the support is achieved through definite acid functions, such as carboxylic [4] or phosphoric [5] acid groups, no substantial degradation of the catalyst occurs. In other instances 0304-5102/88/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 256 when this combination does not occur [6], molybdenum leaching pheno- mena become evident. In order to test this assumption, we decided to heterogenize conventional molybdenum catalysts by using a suitably functionalized polymeric support such as the following dihydroxyboryl-substituted resin (I): CH^ -CH:,C-C- <- i 0=C-NH -CH^CH- ^ ! B(OH)-, (I) (11) This resin is commercially available and has already been used for column chromatographic separation of mixtures of sugars and nucleic acids which form complexes of varying stability with boronic acid groups. The prelimi- nary [7] results obtained have been further confirmed by using polystyryl- boronic acid (II), which was synthesized in our laboratory according to known procedures. Experimental Materials The dihydroxyboryl-substituted resin (I) was obtained from Aldrich and was used without further purification. A solvent-swellable 1% divinyl- benzene-styrene copolymer (Fluka) was functionalized with boronic acid groups by using a multi-step process [8] which included aromatic bromina- tion of polystyrene with bromine (Merck), lithiation of the brominated polymer with n-BuLi (Aldrich) and treatment of the lithiated resin with trimethylborate (Aldrich). Sodium molybdate dihydrate (Merck) was 99.5% pure. t-Butyl hydroperoxide was purchased from Fluka. 1-Phenylethyl hydroperoxide, used as a reference, was prepared from the corresponding hydrocarbon by autoxidation according to standard procedures [9]. Both products were purified via their sodium salts [10]. Cyclohexene of pure grade from Aldrich was freshly distilled prior to use. 257 Catalyst preparation In agreement with earlier findings [7], we have confirmed that starting from either (I) or (II) it is possible to fix molybdenum by adequate interac- tion with the surface boronic acid moieties. Quite independently from the population of B(OH)z groups at the support surface, and as far as the initial B concentration is less than 3.0% (w/w), the molybdenum fixation may be assumed to occur on the basis of an acid-base interaction accompanied by water elimination, as follows: 0 ^ 0 \" II --B-0-Mo-OH + H,0 <2) 1 -hB-QH + HO-Mo-OH J ' \" J \" OH 0 - OH 0 Indeed the optimum conditions for the fixation of Mo(VI) lay in the pH region between 1.0 and 3.0. Furthermore, the specific catalytic activity of the catalysts grafted at constant pH reaches a maximum when the molybdenum content on the resin (in g-atom g~1) equals the number of boronic acid groups of the support (in g-atom of boron g~1). The resins were extensively swelled in dioxane prior to use. All the preparations were performed by using dioxane as co-solvent (dioxane/H^O = 80/20). Water removal was thus performed by azeotropic distillation under reflux in the presence of traces of r^O;. Finally the catalysts were thoroughly washed (water, dioxane and diethyl ether) and dried under vacuum. Elemental analyses were performed prior to use; specifically, the B/Mo ratios were obtained by plasma analyses through a preliminary chemical attack and solubilization of the grafted sample. IR absorption spectra of the Mo-fixed catalysts Quite independently from chemical analysis, the presence of boronic acid groups was confirmed from the infrared spectra of both dihydroxy- boryl-substituted resins (I) and (II), which showed strong absorptions near 1340-50 (broad) and 3450 (broad) cm~1 due to B 0 and OH stretching vibrations respectively. Similar assignments have already been made in the literature for many boron-substituted aromatic compounds containing B-0 bonds [11]. For both catalysts, the Mo-fixing process was tentatively monitored by following the decrease in the intensity of the OH stretching vibration, indicating that the molybdenum center combined with the surface B moieties through the oxygen atom of the OH group. No definite results could be obtained, since the optimum conditions for the fixation of molyb- denum did not imply (see eqn. 2) total removal of the OH groups. However in the Mo-tixed catalysts the B 0 stretching mode definitely shifts to higher frequencies, indicating that the Mo-fixation does affect the B OH functional group. The shift to higher frequencies observed is fairly reminis- cent of a modification of the B 0 stretching mode which was reported 258 when passing from the B OH (acid) to the corresponding B 0 B (anhydride) group [12]. Similar conclusions have also been obtained while independently investigating the thermal [13] behaviour of (I) and (II). Furthermore, in both catalysts typical absorption bands are observed at 910-970 cm\"1, which can be assigned to an asymmetric stretching vibration of the molybdenum-oxygen bond of either the tetrahedral or octahedral oxomolybdenum (6+) species. It has been demonstrated [14] that the frequency of a Mo=0 bond vibration depends upon the number of the coordination and the terminal oxygen atoms on the molybdenum: the oxomolybdenum species with two terminal oxygen atoms in tetrahedral coordination has a wavenumber near 920 cm~1. The frequency also depends upon the degree of distortion of the tetrahedral structure. Thus the absorption peak at 910 - 970 cm~1 may be assumed to indicate a tetrahedral dioxomolybdenum structure. In those runs where the Mo-fixed catalysts were recovered after use and recycled, no variations are observed by IR. Kinetic procedures Kinetic measurements and data analyses were performed as previously indicated [15]. Results Catalytic activities When the epoxidation of cyclohexene is carried out by using t-butyl or ethylbenzene hydroperoxide in the presence of (I) or (II), the observed catalytic activities are comparable to those found with homogeneous bimetallic boron(III)-molybdenum(VI) catalysts [15]. In terms of epoxide yields and olefin conversions, the latter catalysts did not differ with respect to conventional catalysts. Thus it may be concluded that the grafting procedures reported above do not negatively affect the electrophilicity (Lewis acid character) of the molybdenum centre. Kinetic studies A good fit between the calculated curves and the experimental data was obtained by assuming that the very strong time dependence of kinetic coefficients could be explained only by postulating a decreased activity of the catalyst in the latter stages of the reaction due to substantial deactiva- tion. No satisfactory results could be obtained by using any of the Michaelis- Menten-type reported [16] model equations. In agreement with recent findings [15], a good agreement between calculated and experimental data has rather been obtained by testing the following model eqn. (3), in which the strong time dependence of the reaction rate is justified by assuming that the amount of active catalyst decreases due to complex interactions with 259 the active products until an equilibrium concentration is attained. In this equation where r= k KJROH][ol][MeL] (3) [MeL] = [MCLJ^ - K,-[MeL][Rq,H| + 1-^1 ^M^OHf2^ + r\\ KS is the equilibrium constant of the catalyst-hydroperoxide complex, while fei, ai, fei, ep and K^^ ^, ^i, ep are the direct rate constants and equilib- rium constants of formation of the inhibited complexes between the catalyst and the alcohol and epoxide respectively. The order of the deactivation rate with respect to each single product concentration (alcohol and epoxide) is 0.5, and the rate of the reverse reaction from inhibited complex to active catalyst is assumed to be the same for complexes formed with both alcohol and epoxide. Best-fitting parameters of model eqn. (3) are reported in Table 1.

This striking difference cannot be accounted for in terms of oxygen transfer, whether it occurs through a nucleophilic attack of olefin on the electrophilic oxygen atom covalently bonded to the metal [17] or through a pseudocyclic peroxy metallation [18] process. Indeed, from a purely kinetic point of view, when the same model eqn. (3) is applied (see Table 1) comparable values of k and -Kg are obtained. On the other hand, considering the values of c=fe^ep/ ki,ai= ^i.ep/^i.ai obtained in both cases, the cited different behaviour seems rather to imply a diversified pattern of regeneration (see Scheme 1) of the active d metal alkylperoxidic intermediate MeL-ROzH*. If indeed the mode of formation of alkylperoxidic species such as MeL-ROaH results from anion exchange on the metal [19], then with both heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts the mechanism of deactivation MeL(ROKepox) MeLRO H ol Scheme 1. *For the sake of simplicity, the species involved in Scheme 1 are symbolically represented. 261 may require a rapidly increasing anion exchange by more basic species (ROH, epox) which can be hardly displaced further by the hydroperoxide. However, while with catalysts (III) and (IV) the deactivation mechanism irreversibly evolves into a degradation process, with the heterogeneous catalysts (I) and (II) no irreversible decomposition is observed and the catalysts recovered by simple filtration can be recycled with no apparent loss of activity. Thus to prevent catalyst degradation it is not sufficient to control the formation of alkylperoxidic species by protecting the coordinating centre through B 0 Mo covalent bonds, since these bimetallic groups are present in both type of catalysts used. Rather, it is important to satisfactorily define the conditions which preside over the formation of the B 0 Mo bridges. In this case the following distinctive features proved to be essential: (1) the choice of an adequate acidity of the pendant group (i.e. boronic rather than borinic acid group moieties) and (2) the choice of the precursor used for Mo- fixation (i.e. molybdic acid). In order to equate chemical combination with chemical stability, both requirements must be preliminarily fulfilled to prevent catalyst degradation. References 1 N. Indictor and F. Brill, 3. Org.
