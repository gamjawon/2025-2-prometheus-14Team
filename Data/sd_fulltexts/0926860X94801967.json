Box 874, E-41080 Sevilla, Spain (Received 3 August 1993, revised manuscript received 24 November 1993) Abstract Extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis was performed of the oscillations at the Ni K edge of Ni / SiO2 catalysts completely deactivated by thiophene and partially regenerated by oxidation- reduction cycles. The obtained data demonstrates that during the regeneration process sintering of the metal particles takes place. Besides this, the best fit of the completely sulphided catalysts requires the presence of a sulphur shell in the nickel coordination sphere. The average coordination number of sulphur as well as the Ni-S distance suggest the formation of an in depth sulphide layer during the poisoning process. This implies a reconstruction of the metal particles when interacting at 0.034 kPa and 473 K with thiophene.

Introduction Trace amounts of sulphur present in feeds for methanation, hydrogenation and hydro- cracking can poison nickel catalysts often used in these processes. Several attempts have been made to overcome this problem by purifying feed streams or increasing the thiores- istance of nickel catalysts. However, there are no definitive solutions to sulphur poisoning, and regeneration of deactivated catalysts should be considered in some cases. Deactivation of nickel catalysts by sulphur results in the formation of a bidimensional Ni3S2 layer which is much more stable than bulk sulphides [ 1-3 ]. Several treatments have *Corresponding author. 0926-860X/94/$07.00 1994 Elsevier Science B.V. All fights reserved SSD10926-860X ( 9 3 ) E02447-A 198 A. Aguinaga et aL /Applied Catalysis A: General 110 (1994) 197-205 been attempted to remove sulphur from nickel poisoned catalysts, among them reduction by hydrogen [2,4,5] and oxidation by oxygen or water [6-8]. In spite of the industrial importance of the process, few reports deal with the problem of regenerating poisoned nickel catalysts and usually the results are quite unsatisfactory. Recently, a new regeneration method was proposed by one of the present authors [ 9,10]. This method implies successive oxidation-reduction cycles allowing to remove up to 90% of the sulphur of the completely deactivated nickel catalyst. However, the activity decrease observed in the hydrogenation of benzene (ca. 25%) for the regenerated samples with respect to that of the partially poisoned ones containing the same amount of sulphur can be understood either as the result of sintering of nickel particles or the presence of non-toxic sulphur. Using extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), Clause et al. [ 11,12] showed the formation of a Ni-SiO2 compound in the first stages of the preparation of nickel catalysts. In this report, we attempt to study by EXAFS the factors affecting the activity of regenerated nickel catalysts in the hydrogenation of benzene as well as attempt to depict the structure of the sulphided catalysts. 2. Experimental A nickel on silica (Kali Chemie AF 125) catalyst was prepared by the precipitation- deposition method [9,10]. After calcination (450, 16 h) the nickel content was 15.5%, and the total surface area 280 m2 g- 1. The metallic surface area of the fresh, poisoned and regenerated samples was measured after reduction in hydrogen flow at 500 for 16 h by hydrogen chemisorption at room temperature using the pulse method (Micromeritics Pulse Chemisorb 2700). Details of the measurement protocol can be found elsewhere [ 9,10]. The metallic surface area of the fresh catalyst was 129 m2 g-~ of nickel and the degree of reduction was 95%. The poisoned catalysts were prepared under reaction conditions in an integral reactor using benzene containing 5.6 wt.-% of thiophene according to a procedure previously described [ 9,10]. The regeneration treatments consisted of cyclic oxidation (0.05% 02 in Ar) and reduction (H2) steps [9,10]. The activity of the samples for benzene hydrogenation to cyclohexane was measured after reduction (H2, 150 cm3 min- 1, 16 h, 500) in a differential reactor (atmospheric pressure, 200, PBz = 0.06 atm, 6.08 kPa). The hydrogenation activity of the fresh catalyst was 8.3 mol Bz g- ~ Ni h- 1. The sulphur content of the samples was determined with an Antek 701 C fluorescence sulphur system. EXAFS spectra were recorded at the K absorption edge of nickel (Eo = 8333 eV) at station EXAFS III (D.C.I.-LURE). Monochromatization was obtained by a double silicon crystal working at the (331) reflection, detuned 20% in intensity to minimize higher harmonics. The measurements were carried out in transmission using optimized ion cham- bers as detectors. At least four scans were collected for every sample in the \"quick EXAFS\" mode. Scans were averaged to minimize high- and low-frequency noise. Samples were A. Aguinaga et aL /Applied Catalysis A: General 110 (1994) 197-205 199 pressed into self-supporting pellets using BN when necessary with an absorbance of ca. 2.5 (A/Zx = 1 ), and measured at room temperature. EXAFS data analysis and handling were carried out with the program r, mWEXAFS from the Eindhoven University of Technology. Standard procedures were used to extract the EXAFS data from the measured adsorption spectra. Normalization was done by dividing by the height of the adsorption edge, and the background subtracted by using cubic spline routines. EXAFS data were analyzed by using experimental phase shift and backscattering amplitude functions for Ni-O and Ni-Ni contributions that were extracted from the EXAFS spectra of NiO and a Ni foil. Multiple shell fitting in the k and R spaces was done with the application of both k~ and k3 weighting which results in a better decoupling of the coordi- nation number (N) and the Debye-Waller factor (&r2) as well as coordination distance (R) and inner potential correction (Eo) [ 13,14]. 3. Results and discussion Two samples are studied by EXAFS: NiSi5 and NiSil 5. The first one NiSi5, corresponds to the catalyst deactivated by thiophene under reaction conditions, the process being stopped when the hydrogenation activity vanished. The sulphur content of this sample was 20 mg S/goat, corresponding to 1.2 atoms of sulphur per atom of nickel on the surface of the fresh catalyst ( 1.2 S/Nis), where Nis stands for the amount of surface nickel atoms. The second sample NiSi 15, was partially regenerated, its sulphur content being 2.72 mg S/gcat, corre- sponding to 0.16 S/Nis. The hydrogenation activity of this sample, related to that of the fresh catalyst was 0.59. The X-ray absorption spectrum was recorded for the catalyst studied for different sulphur coverages before and after the regeneration cycles. Fig. 1 shows the unfiltered oscillatory EXAFS function x(k) at the nickel K edge for the studied catalyst for both the poisoned and the regenerated catalyst. For the sake of comparison the EXAFS function corresponding to NiO is also included. The x(k) \"k~ function for the catalysts closely resemble that of the reference NiO. The radial distribution functions (RDF) around nickel in NiO was calculated from crystallo- graphic data given by X-ray diffraction. The RDF obtained for NiO, without phase shift and backscattering amplitude correction, shows maxima at 1.59, 2.65, 3.73, 4.76 and 5.48 .~ which corresponds to Ni-O and Ni-Ni scatterer pairs placed in successive coordination shells in a NaCI type structure. From the data in Fig. 1 two main aspects are worth noting. There is a qualitative decrease in the intensity of the x(k)\" (k) function, for high values of k, in the poisoned samples with respect to the regenerated ones and the pure NiO which may indicate a smaller particle size in the poisoned samples. In consequence, a sintering process during the oxidation-reduction cycles performed for regenerating the catalyst can be postulated. In addition to this, the most striking feature in the x(k) function is the qualitative decrease in intensity at k values close to 5 .~- 1 (Fig. 1) on increasing the sulphur content. This decrease is reflected in the corresponding FTs in an intensity decrease of the maxima at 2.65 .~, which according to the literature results [ 15 ] should be ascribed to a pair of Ni-Ni scatterers in NiO. 200 A.

The fitting procedure of the experimental spectra followed in this work has been previ- ously described [ 16,17]. Best fit techniques in the k and R spaces, shell isolation by means of inverse FTs and subtraction of the calculated Ni-O and Ni-Ni contributions from the primary EXAFS function were employed. Backscattering amplitude and phase shifts were taken, according to a previously described procedure [ 18], from the EXAFS spectrum of a Ni foil and well crystallized NiO. The experimental k range allows us to introduce a number of free parameters that corre- spond to more than five shells, according to the number of independent data points available [ 19]. When analysing the catalyst samples only three shells are needed for fitting the experimental spectra, the results of such fittings are shown in Table 1. The standard devia- tions for all the parameters of the fitting are shown in brackets. The accuracy of the technique is however lower than the statistical standard deviations of the fitting, and errors can be estimated as 2% in the value of R and around 15% in the case of the coordination numbers. The introduction of more shells has no statistical significance according to the )(2 parameter and in addition to this, the x(k). k functions and the corresponding FTs lack features that, in principle, may justify the introduction of other shells different from that corresponding to NiO. This result is in accordance to the well documented passivation of nickel catalysts during storage in air [ 20], the passivation results in the formation of NiO layers as observed in the EXAFS spectrum. Taking this behaviour into account, the spectrum of the regenerated catalyst was acquired after the oxidation cycle. A.

Data in Table 1 show that while the values obtained in the fittings for the Ni-O and Ni- Ni distances (R), as well as the values for Eo-corr are consistent with the presence of nickel oxide in a NaC1 type structure, the coordination numbers (N), specially for the scatterers of the first shell are too high to be acceptable. In every case, these numbers are higher than six which is the maximum number of oxygens that nickel can accommodate in a NaCl-type structure, while/to-2 values are higher than those obtained for bulk Nit, specially for NiSi5 sample. For solving this problem an alternative fitting was done in which the maximum number of oxygens in the first coordination shell was restricted to be less than or equal to six. Fig. 2 shows the fitted FTs for the NiSi5 sample using both models. It is clear from the figure that the model in which the number of oxygens has been limited to six (Fig. 2B) results in a worsened fittin.g. In both cases, the fitted function presents the main differences for R values close to 2 A without phase shift and backscattering amplitude correction. This feature might be due to the presence of sulphur in the catalyst. Bartholomew et al. [2] suggest the formation of Ni3S2, on the nickel surface, in the presence of low H2S partial pressures. So, the spectrum was measured of well crystallized Ni3S2, prepared by reduction of nickel sulphate according to a procedure previously described [ 21 ]. Fig. 3 shows the x(k)\" k function for this compound and its corresponding FT. A maximum can be observed in the FT of this compound for R = 2/~, which supports the assumption that the difference observed in the fitted function at R = 2/~, is due to the presence of sulphur. In Table 2 the fitting parameters for Ni3S2 are shown. Theoretical [ 22 ] phase shifts and backscattering amplitude functions were used for the Ni-S absorber- backscatterer pair. The calculated parameters for fitting the Ni3S2 are in close agreement to the radial distribution function calculated from the reported lattice parameter and atomic positions deduced for this compound from X-ray diffraction data [ 23 ]. Taking into account the presence of sulphur in the coordination shell of nickel a fitting cycle of sulphided catalysts is now performed. The results obtained are shown in Table 3 for the NiSi5 sample. The introduction of sulphur in the nickel coordination sphere has the effect of decreasing the coordination number of oxygens from 7.6 (Table 1 ) to a reasonable 202 A.

These two fitted spectra, the one considering sulphur and the one with a coordination number of the oxygens higher than six, have similar statistical significance according to the X2 parameter. However, the first fit (Table 1) can be discarded since the coordination number of nickel in the first sphere is higher than the maximum number that should be expected for NiO. For the sample NiSil5 the introduction of an additional S shell at 2.36 ,~ with coordination numbers in the 0.4-0.6 range lead to fittings of the experimental data of similar quality to that obtained with the set of parameters included in Table 1 for this sample, but with lower coordination numbers for the absorber- backscattered pairs Ni-O (6.0-6.8) and Ni-Ni ( 12.0 for the shell at 2.97/~ and 4.2 for the shell at 4.2 ,~). Comparison of the Ni-Ni coordination numbers of NiSil5 with those obtained for NiSi5 catalyst (Table 3) indicates that a sintering process takes place during the oxidation-reduction cycles. It should be noted here, that the imprecision in determining the Ni-S coordination number is higher for this sample than for NiSi5, due to the higher intensity of the maximum in the Fourier transform for nickel atoms at 2.97 ,~ that strongly overlaps the Ni-S contribution. Moreover, the latter should be weaker for NiSil5 due to the lower sulphur content of this sample. The Ni-S distance obtained in these fittings is similar to that found in Ni3S2 (Tables 2 and 3), and the coordination number for sulphur ( 1.2 _ 0.2) is in the order of magnitude that should be expected for the formation of an in depth bulk sulphide [2]. The measured amount of sulphur present in the catalyst is S/Nis = 1.2 and only around 20% of the nickel atoms are present at the catalyst surface. If we assume that all the sulphur is present as Ni3S2, around 36% of the total nickel atoms would be affected by sulphur and since the coordination polyhedra of nickel should be [NiS4], the average coordination number of nickel for the whole metal particle (36% of nickel atoms having coordination number of 204 A. Aguinaga et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 110 (1994) 197-205 sulphur equal to 4 and 64% having coordination zero of sulphur) can be estimated to be 1.43. So, the average coordination number found by EXAFS is in excellent agreement with the one estimated for the formation of a bulk sulphide (Ni3S2). Moreover, the Ni-S distance 2.36/~ is in close agreement to the value obtained from low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) experiments for the adsorption of sulphur on nickel single crystals [ 1,24]. Perderau and Oudar [ 1 ] postulated a reconstruction of the nickel surface when sulphur is adsorbed on Ni(111) single crystals, leading to a true bidimensional Ni2S layer. The stoichiometry found for sulphur adsorbed on nickel single crystals, at saturation coverage, is independent of the crystal face and equal to 0.58. Recently, Mangnus et al. [ 25 ] postulated the formation of NiS1 +x phases during the sulphiding process at 210 K, the inner layer being sulphided at temperatures ranging from 270 to 500 K. If a surface layer having this latter stoichiometry is formed the average coordination number for sulphur found by EXAFS has to be around 0.2, which is not the case. These results infer the presence of Ni3S2 in the poisoned catalyst which may account for a poisoning process within the bulk of the nickel particle. As the activity in the hydrogenation of benzene falls down to zero for S/Nis = 1.2, assuming that Nis corresponds to the surface nickel atoms measured in the fresh reduced catalyst two processes can be envisaged: (i) sulphur is adsorbed on the silica support, and (ii) a reconstruction of the surface of nickel particles takes place which implies an increase in the openness of the surface. In fact, the Ni(210) plane can accommodate 1.09 sulphur per nickel atom, the number of sulphur atoms per cm2 being almost the same as for Ni (100) or Ni(lll) faces [11,12]. Although the presence of sulphur on the support and/or of sulphur species that do not influence the catalyst activity cannot be disregarded in our experiments, the S-Ni distance as well as the average coordination number found in this study suggest the reconstruction of the nickel surface on sulphiding with 0.34 kPa of thiophene at 473 K. Moreover, it has been postulated that passivation of nickel catalysts results in the formation of two or three oxide layers [26]. If this is the case the average coordination number found by EXAFS for the passivated catalysts should be well below six (the average particle size of the catalyst is ca. 50 A); so, a reconstruction process which implies the presence of an increased number of nickel atoms on the catalyst surface would explain the oxygen coordination number. 4. Conclusions The EXAFS spectra of the poisoned and regenerated catalysts demonstrate a sintering process on the oxidation-reduction cycles for regenerating the catalyst. We may conclude that sulphur is present in the coordination sphere of nickel, with a Ni- S distance similar to that found in NiaS2. The parameters obtained from the EXAFS spectra suggest a sulphidation in depth of the nickel particles, which implies the reconstruction of the surface of the nickel particles. The presence of non-toxic sulphur cannot be disregarded from the present EXAFS data. In order to discard non-toxic sulphur species EXAFS measurements have to be carried out in situ. A.

Box 874, E-41080 Sevilla, Spain * Corresponding author. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis was performed of the oscillations at the Ni K edge of Ni/SiO2 catalysts completely deactivated by thiophene and partially regenerated by oxidationreduction cycles. The obtained data demonstrates that during the regeneration process sintering of the metalparticles takes place. Besides this, the best fit of the completely sulphided catalysts requires the presence of a sulphur shell in the nickel coordination sphere. The average coordination number of sulphur as well as the Ni-S distance suggest the formation of an in depthsulphide layer during the poisoning process. This implies a reconstruction of the metal particles when interacting at 0.034 kPa and 473 K with thiophene. catalyst characterization (EXAFS) extended X- ray absorption fine structure nickel/silica poisoning sintering sulphur thiophene References [1] M.
