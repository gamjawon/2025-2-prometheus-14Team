Graphical abstract An excellent and durable zinc-iodine-manganese hybrid battery was fabricated to enhance the Mn and iodine redox reactions and strengthen the adsorption of iodine species. Aqueous Zn-I2-Mn hybrid batteries demonstrate enhanced capacity, superior redox reaction kinetics, and prolonged cycle life compared to their Zn-I2 and Zn-Mn counterparts, making them promising candidates for grid-scale energy storage. Nevertheless, challenges remain in developing multifunctional positive electrode materials and elucidating the mechanistic synergy governing iodine and manganese redox reactions. Herein, we present a high-performance free-standing electrode composed of birnessite (KMnO) nanosheet arrays in situ grown on carbon cloth (CC@KMnO) for constructing a Zn-I2-Mn hybrid battery. Combined theoretical studies and in situ characterizations reveal that CC@KMnO enhances iodine species adsorption, lowers the Gibbs free energy change for iodine reduction, and significantly accelerates I−/I3 −/I5 − redox kinetics while suppressing polyiodide shuttling and corrosion effects. Synchronously, the ZnI2 electrolyte facilitates the dissolution of residual and exfoliated KMnO, thereby improving manganese redox reaction kinetics, reversibility, and enhancing cycling stability. Leveraging this mutually reinforcing effect, the Zn-I2-Mn hybrid battery achieves an impressive areal capacity of 2.02 mAh cm−2 and maintains long-term durability over 3600 cycles at 2 mA cm−2. This work provides valuable insights into designing efficient and durable hybrid energy storage systems. Keywords Zn-I2-Mn hybrid batteries Dual redox mechanism Reaction kinetics Electrocatalytic role Reciprocal enhancement 1 Introduction The rapid expansion of intermittent renewable energy sources including wind, solar, wave, and tidal power has spurred significant demand for safe and efficient grid-scale energy storage technologies [1–3]. Although lithium-ion batteries currently dominate the mainstream energy storage market, their widespread adoption is severely constrained by limited lithium resources and critical safety concerns [4–6]. In this regard, aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) have emerged as a promising alternative, offering inherent safety, environmental friendliness, and a high theoretical capacity of 820 mAh g−1 [7,8]. Among the various ZIB systems, zinc-iodine (Zn-I2) batteries have attracted considerable attention due to their low cost, high theoretical specific capacity (211 mAh gI −1), and competitive output voltage (1.30 V) [9–12]. However, Zn-I2 batteries still face critical challenges, including the poor electrical conductivity of I2, sluggish redox kinetics, and grievous polyiodide shuttling, all of which grossly limit Coulombic efficiency and cycle life [13,14]. To address these issues, numerous strategies have been explored to enhance the electrochemical performance of Zn-I2 batteries [15–25]. Yet, their areal performance remains constrained by the low mass loading of I2, typically 20–50 wt%. Recently, a new type of Zn-I2 battery configuration utilizing I− or I3 − electrolytes has been proposed as an appealing solution to overcome the limitations of low I2 loading and poor conductivity [26,27]. This approach also eliminates the complex and tedious preparation process of conventional I2-positive electrodes, further enhancing its practical viability [28]. Nevertheless, compared to solid I2 electrodes, dissolved I− ions in the electrolyte exacerbate self-discharge and shuttling effects. Improving the kinetics of I−/I3 − redox reactions requires the integration of electrocatalytic sites within electrode materials. For instance, Yang et al. demonstrated enhanced iodine conversion and suppressed shuttling using a single-atom Cu-embedded nitrogen-doped Ketjen black positive electrode [29]. Similarly, Chen and co-workers developed a molecular catalyst, chloro(protoporphyrinato)iron, to accelerate I− redox reactions [30]. Despite these advances, such materials typically contribute negligible additional capacity, ultimately restricting overall battery performance. To simultaneously enhance the iodine conversion kinetics and increase capacity, the development of novel hybrid designs leveraging synergistic dual redox reactions is highly desirable. An ideal positive electrode material for such a system must exhibit excellent compatibility with iodine redox chemistry, incorporating both abundant catalytic sites to facilitate iodine conversion and additional redox-active sites to boost capacity. Given the high redox potential, substantial theoretical specific capacity, and natural abundance, manganese oxides (MnO x ) hold promises for constructing hybrid batteries [31–33]. Notably, I− ions have been reported to improve the reversibility of the Mn2+/MnO2 transition [34]. However, in addition to irreversible dissolution, MnO x often suffers from sluggish reaction kinetics and structural deformation, leading to unsatisfactory rate capacity and cycling stability [35–37]. Hence, developing an efficient Zn-I2-Mn hybrid system and elucidating the underlying mechanistic synergy remain significant challenges. In this work, a free-standing positive electrode composed of birnessite (KMnO) nanosheet arrays in situ grown on carbon cloth (CC@KMnO) was fabricated via a simple wet-chemical strategy for constructing an efficient Zn-I2-Mn hybrid battery. Mechanism studies show that the H+ ion intercalation/deintercalation of KMnO and I−/I3 −/I5 − redox reactions jointly dominate the energy storage of the Zn-I2-Mn hybrid battery. The CC@KMnO effectively enhances iodine species adsorption, reduces the Gibbs free energy change for iodine reduction, and significantly accelerates the I−/I3 −/I5 − redox kinetics, thus suppressing polyiodide shuttle and corrosion effects. Furthermore, the ZnI2 electrolyte plays a dual role in facilitating the dissolution of inactive KMnO at the positive electrode and enabling the recycling of exfoliated manganese species from the electrolyte, thereby improving manganese redox reaction kinetics, reversibility, and cycling stability. As a result, the Zn-I2-Mn hybrid battery delivers an exceptional areal capacity of 2.02 mAh cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2 and maintains robust durability over 3600 cycles. 2 Experimental 2.1 Chemicals All the chemicals were of analytical grade, purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (China) and used as received without further purification. Commercial CC was sourced from Shanghai Hesen Electric Co. Ltd. (China). 2.2 Preparation of CC@KMnO The CC was first calcined in air at 500 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The pretreated CC was then immersed in 100 mL of deionized water, followed by a dropwise addition of 5 mL of 0.25 mmol KMnO4 solution. The reaction proceeded at 95 °C for 1 h under constant stirring. Finally, the resulting CC@KMnO composite was washed with deionized water and dried at 60 °C overnight. The mass loading of KMnO was approximately 1–1.25 mg cm−2. The Supplementary Information contains material characterization, electrochemical measurements, battery assembly, calculations for average valence state, areal capacity, energy density, power density, Warburg coefficient, and computational methods. 3 Results and discussion The KMnO nanosheet arrays were in-situ grown on the surface of CC using a facile wet-chemical method, as depicted in Fig. 1 (a). The morphology and microstructure of the CC@KMnO were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The SEM image reveals that three-dimensional cross-linked KMnO nanosheet arrays with a twisted surface uniformly surround carbon fibers (Fig. 1b). TEM analysis further confirms the thin nanosheet architecture of KMnO (Fig. 1c). High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in Fig. 1(d) confirms the successful growth of KMnO on the CC, where distinct lattice spacings of 0.195, 0.235, 0.248, and 0.352 nm are indexed to the (112), (003), (110), and (002) crystal planes of KMnO, respectively. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the CC@KMnO exhibits the set of nonuniform and concentric rings, which are all assigned to the carbon and KMnO with a polycrystalline structure, demonstrating the successful synthesis of the CC@KMnO (Fig. 1e). Furthermore, element mapping images demonstrate the homogeneous distribution of K, Mn, and O elements throughout the nanosheet framework, verifying the uniform growth of KMnO on the CC substrate (Fig. S1). The composition and crystal structure of CC@KMnO were further investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 1(f), the evident diffraction peaks at 12.4°, 36.5°, and 65.7° correspond to the (001), (110), and (020) facets of layered birnessite (K0.5Mn2O4 ∙ 1.5H2O, JCPDS No. 42-1317), respectively. Additionally, peaks observed at 43.5° and 24.6° are attributed to the (100) plane of carbon and the overlapping (002) reflections of KMnO and carbon [38,39]. Fig. 1(g) shows the Raman spectrum of CC@KMnO, in which the peaks centered at 650, 576, and 497 cm−1 are assigned to the ν1 and ν2 stretching modes of [MnO6] octahedral and the ν3 vibration of Mn–O band arising from interlayer interactions, respectively [40,41]. The prominent signals at around 1350 and 1604 cm−1 are indexed to the D and G bands of carbon [42]. In order to ascertain the valence state of the Mn element, high-resolution Mn 2p and Mn 3s XPS spectra were further analyzed (Fig. 1h and i). As shown, two spin-orbit doublets at 641.9/653.1 and 643.7/654.6 eV can be deconvoluted from the Mn 2p XPS spectrum, corresponding to the Mn3+ and Mn4+, respectively [43,44]. The Mn 3s XPS spectrum exhibits two doublets with an energy splitting of 4.77 eV, manifesting an average oxidation valence of +3.56 for the Mn element, as calculated by Eq. (S1) [31]. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms (Fig. 1j) demonstrate the porous structure of CC@KMnO, which exhibits a large surface area of 979.7 m2 g−1, which is higher than that of the CC (944.9 m2 g−1). The pore size distribution profile of CC@KMnO in Fig. S2 reveals the hierarchically porous structure with an average pore diameter of 2.20 nm. This enhanced specific surface area and hierarchical pore structure are both conducive to exposing more active sites and accelerating reaction kinetics, thereby boosting charge storage performance [45,46]. Afterward, the Zn-I2-Mn hybrid battery was assembled in a CR2025 coin cell, employing CC@KMnO as the positive electrode, Zn sheet as the negative electrode, and 2 M ZnSO4 + 0.3 M ZnI2 as the electrolyte. For comparison, the Zn-I2 battery and Zn-Mn battery were prepared using pristine CC as the positive electrode in 2 M ZnSO4 + 0.3 M ZnI2 electrolyte, and CC@KMnO positive electrode in 2 M ZnSO4 solution, respectively. The electrochemical performance was initially investigated via cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests. As shown in Fig. 2 (a), an evident redox pair at 1.61/1.36 V corresponding to H+ ion deintercalation/intercalation in manganese oxides is observed in the CV profile [31]. While an additional pair at 1.26/1.12 V is associated with the redox reactions of I−/I3 −. The significantly larger integrated CV area of the Zn-I2-Mn hybrid system compared to both control cells indicates superior charge storage capacity, confirming synergistic dual redox activity from both KMnO and iodine species. Notably, after adding ZnI2 electrolyte, the potential gap of the redox process of KMnO is reduced and the corresponding current densities are increased, suggesting decreased polarization and enhanced insertion/desertion dynamics for CC@KMnO (Fig. 2b). Besides, the CC@KMnO shows a lower potential gap for iodine reduction reaction compared to the CC, suggesting that the KMnO markedly promotes iodine reduction kinetics (Fig. 2c). Remarkably, a maximum areal capacity of 2.02 mAh cm−2 at a current density of 2 mA cm−2 is reached with the Zn-I2-Mn hybrid battery, superior to those of the comparisons (Fig. 2d and Eq. (S2)). The value also surpasses most reported Zn-based systems (Table S1). In addition, the Zn-I2-Mn hybrid battery maintains a high areal capacity of 1.74 mAh cm−2 when the current density is increased to 15 mA cm−2, whereas a capacity of 0.81 mAh cm−2 is retained for Zn-Mn battery (Fig. S3). Moreover, a long-term cyclic life of 3600 cycles with 92% capacity retention at the current density of 2 mA cm−2 is achieved with the Zn-I2-Mn hybrid battery, surpassing those of Zn-I2 (941 cycles) and Zn-Mn (398 cycles) batteries, which provides powerful evidence for its better cycling performance (Fig. 2e and Table S2). Meanwhile, the Zn-I2 battery shows a Coulombic efficiency of 99.4%, while a relatively low value of 97.3% is achieved for the Zn-Mn battery (Fig. S4). The low Coulombic efficiency of Zn-Mn batteries is mainly attributed to the irreversible structural evolution of manganese oxides, the loss of active Mn, and the instability of the Zn negative electrode [47]. However, the Zn-I2-Mn hybrid battery exhibits a Coulombic efficiency of 99.9%, indicating improved electrode reversibility. Impressively, the Zn-I2-Mn hybrid battery with CC@KMnO positive electrode manifests a maximum energy density of 2.36 mWh cm−2 at the power density of 2.34 W cm−2 and also reaches a high power density of 17.07 W cm−2 at the energy of 1.98 mWh cm−2 (Fig. S5 and Eqs. (S3) and (S4)). Fig. 2(f) compares the areal capacity, cycle life, and rate performance of the Zn-I2-Mn hybrid battery with Zn-based batteries, highlighting its potential for practical energy storage applications [48–51]. Furthermore, the charge transfer and ion diffusion kinetics of the Zn-I2-Mn hybrid battery were investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). As illustrated in Fig. 2(g), the hybrid system exhibits the smallest semicircle in the high-frequency region along with the smallest charge transfer resistance (R ct), indicating the fastest charge transfer kinetics (Table S3). Besides, the Zn-I2-Mn battery displays a steeper slope in the low-frequency region compared to the Zn-Mn and Zn-I2 devices, indicating enhanced ion diffusion kinetics. These findings are further supported by Bode phase diagrams, in which the Zn-I2-Mn hybrid battery manifests the lowest phase angle (Fig. S6). Then, the ion diffusion process was quantitatively analyzed using the Warburg factor, which was obtained by Z' as a function of ω −1/2 (Eqs. (S5) and (S6)). As illustrated, the Zn-I2-Mn hybrid battery has the lowest Warburg factor of 1.44 Ω s−1/2, confirming accelerated ion diffusion (Fig. 2h). Collectively, these results indicate that the synergistic effect of KMnO4 and ZnI2 additives facilitates the reaction kinetics and ion diffusion, therefore boosting overall energy storage performance. To gain deeper insight into the reaction kinetics of the Zn-I2-Mn hybrid batteries, CV curves in the range of 1–5 mV s−1 were analyzed using Eq. (S7) (Fig. S7) [52,53]. The calculated b values for peak 1 and peak 3 in the Zn-I2-Mn hybrid battery are 0.83 and 0.77, respectively, indicating a mixed capacitive and diffusion-controlled mechanism (Fig. S8). These values exceed those of the Zn-Mn battery (0.74) and the Zn-I2 battery (0.70), respectively, indicating enhanced redox kinetics due to their mutually reinforcing effect of iodine and KMnO. Furthermore, to quantitatively assess the capacitive and diffusion-controlled contributions, CV curves were deconvoluted using Eq. (S8) [54]. As shown in Fig. 3 (a–c), the Zn-I2-Mn hybrid battery obtains a capacitive contribution of 86.9% at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1, larger than 78.8% of the Zn-Mn battery and 85.6% of the Zn-I2 battery, indicating a mixed charge storage mechanism of surface-controlled and diffusion-controlled processes. The large surface capacitive contribution is mainly attributed to two factors: (1) the high surface area of KMnO@CC naturally leads to significant capacitive contributions and provides abundant active sites for boosting iodine redox reactions; (2) the thin-nanosheet structure of KMnO facilitates rapid ion intercalation/deintercalation. Notably, the capacitive contribution for the Zn-I2-Mn hybrid battery increases significantly with an increasing scan rate, which is conducive to rapid reaction kinetics. These values consistently exceed those of Zn-Mn and Zn-I2 batteries, explaining the superior rate capability of the hybrid battery (Fig. 3d–f). Furthermore, the reaction kinetics during the discharge and charge process was probed using in situ EIS measurements (Fig. 3g–i). As depicted, the charge transfer resistance (R ct) exhibits a slight increase during discharging from 1.8 to 0.2 V and declines upon charging, demonstrating fast kinetics and excellent electrochemical reversibility. In order to elucidate the energy storage mechanism of Zn-I2-Mn hybrid batteries, the morphology and phase evolution of CC@KMnO during the charging and discharging process were investigated. As illustrated in ex situ SEM images, the nanosheet morphology remains intact at a fully charged state, indicating the excellent stability of CC@KMnO (Fig. S9). In contrast, at a fully discharged state, numerous by-products of Zn4SO4(OH)6·5H2O (JCPDS No. 78-0246) are formed on the electrode surface, which is probably due to the pH variations accompanying H+ ion intercalation/deintercalation (Fig. S10). These by-products subsequently dissolve upon re-charging, confirming the excellent electrochemical reversibility. Ex situ XPS was then conducted on CC@KMnO to track valence state changes during the galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) process. As shown in Fig. 4 (a), the Mn 2p 3/2 peak shifts to lower binding energy at the fully discharged state, reflecting Mn reduction during H+ insertion [33]. This peak reverts to the original state after recharging to 1.8 V, manifesting the reversible nature of manganese redox reactions. Fig. 4(b) displays the high-resolution XPS spectra of I 3d, where peaks at 630.9 and 619.45 eV corresponding to I− species emerge in the full discharged state [55]. After charging, I3 − and I5 − at 619.65/631.09 eV and 620.80/631.98 eV occur, indicating the oxidation reactions of I− to I3 −/I5 − [56]. These results demonstrate the dual redox mechanism involving H+ insertion/extraction of KMnO and I−/I3 −/I5 − conversion in the Zn-I2-Mn hybrid batteries. Furthermore, operando Raman spectroscopy was carried out to monitor the iodine conversion process and clarify the catalytic role of CC@KMnO. As illustrated, characteristic peaks indexed to I3 − and I5 − ions gradually appear during charging from 0.2 to 1.8 V, which fade off upon subsequent discharge, illustrating the highly reversible iodine redox chemistry (Fig. 4c) [9,57]. In stark contrast, polyiodide signals always maintain high intensities for the CC during the discharging process, implying inferior reduction kinetics and grievous shuttling effect (Fig. 4d). These findings were validated by operando ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, in which the Zn-I2 battery demonstrates stronger I3 − adsorption compared to the Zn-I2-Mn system during charging (Fig. 4e and f) [30]. Collectively, these results unequivocally demonstrate the superior catalytic activity of CC@KMnO for iodine reduction reactions, which is beneficial to mitigating the shuttle effect in Zn-I2-Mn hybrid batteries. Moreover, to clarify the role of I− additives in the redox reactions of KMnO, UV–vis spectra were collected. Two CC@KMnO electrodes (1.5 cm × 1.5 cm) were immersed in 15 mL of 2 M ZnSO4 solution with and without ZnI2 additives. After 24 h of immersion, the solutions were analyzed by UV–vis. The spectra reveal that after immersion of CC@KMnO into ZnI2, the absorbance peak of I− at 227 nm decreases, while two new peaks appear around 289 and 352 nm, which are ascribed to the formation of I3 − ions (Fig. 4g and h). These results confirm that I− reacts with KMnO to form I3 −. This is conducive to activating inert KMnO and recycling exfoliated KMnO in the electrolyte, thereby enhancing reaction kinetics and reversibility (Eq. (1)). (1) 2 K x Mn 2 O 4 + ( 12 - 3 x ) I - + 16 H + → 4 Mn 2 + + 2 x K + + ( 4 - x ) I 3 - + 8 H 2 O Based on these findings, we propose a dual redox mechanism involving H+ intercalation/deintercalation in KMnO and I−/I3 −/I5 − redox chemistry in the Zn-I2-Mn hybrid battery (Fig. 4i). During the charging process, H+ ion deintercalation from KMnO occurs, and I− ions are adsorbed on the KMnO electrode surface and further oxidized to I3 −. Besides, I3 − can react with I− to form I5 − meanwhile. Upon discharging, H+ ions intercalate into KMnO, accompanied by the reduction of I5 −/I3 − to I− ions under the catalysis of CC@KMnO. In addition, residual and exfoliated KMnO continues to dissolve by reacting with I− ions in the electrolyte, reinforcing the reversibility of manganese redox reactions. Furthermore, the density functional theory (DFT) was conducted to understand the catalytic effect of CC@KMnO on the iodine reduction reaction. Fig. 5 (a) depicts the calculated adsorption energies of I−, I3 −, and I5 − ions on KMnO/graphene, with a comparison to those on graphene structures. Apparently, the I−, I3 −, and I5 − exhibit more negative adsorption energies of −2.86, −0.83, and −0.93 eV on the KMnO/graphene, compared to −0.82, −0.56, and −0.82 eV on graphene, respectively, indicating stronger interactions (Eq. (S9)). The charge interactions between I−/I3 −/I5 − and different slabs were further investigated by charge density difference. As illustrated, electrons are transferred from I−, I3 −, and I5 − species to the KMnO/graphene, which is beneficial for promoting iodine conversion and suppressing the shuttling effect (Fig. 5b). In contrast, extremely weak charge interactions are observed between I−/I3 −/I5 − ions and pure graphene structure. Furthermore, the free energy profiles of the iodine reduction reaction reveal that the reduction of *I3 − to *I− is the potential-determining step (PDS) for graphene, which requires a high Gibbs free energy change of 3.08 eV, larger than 1.30 eV for KMnO/graphene. Additionally, the PDS shifts from I3 −/I− conversion to I− desorption on KMnO/graphene, and consequently the Gibbs free energy change decreases to 2.89 eV, confirming its more favorable thermodynamic behavior (Fig. 5c and Eq. (S10)). To verify the superiority of CC@KMnO in mitigating polyiodide shuttle and corrosion, the morphology of the Zn negative electrode after 200 cycles at 10 mA cm−2 was systemically investigated by SEM. Impressively, the Zn negative electrode paired with CC@KMnO exhibits a compact and smooth deposition layer (Fig. 5d, e), whereas a looser and porous structure prone to side reactions is observed for the Zn-I2 battery (Fig. 5f, g). These results are consistent well with the confocal laser scanning microscopy images, in which the Zn negative electrode in a hybrid battery manifests a lower surface roughness (Fig. 5h, i). Besides, to determine the iodine species on the Zn negative electrode, the Zn electrodes in Zn-I2 and Zn-I2-Mn batteries after 200 cycles were immersed in ZnSO4 solution for UV–vis tests. As illustrated in Fig. S11, a lower absorbance peak of I3 − is observed for the Zn-I2-Mn hybrid batteries, indicating that the shutting of polyiodides to the Zn negative electrode has been effectively inhibited. These findings demonstrate that the polyiodide shuttle and corrosion are effectively restrained by the CC@KMnO via enhanced polyiodide adsorption and improved iodine reduction kinetics. Therefore, we can conclude that the ZnI2 electrolyte plays a dual role in facilitating the dissolution of inactive KMnO at the positive electrode and enabling the recycling of exfoliated manganese species from the electrolyte, thereby improving manganese redox reaction kinetics, reversibility, and cycling stability. In addition, the KMnO@CC positive electrode demonstrates enhanced polyiodide adsorption and superior catalytic activity for iodine reduction reaction, thus effectively suppressing polyiodide shuttle and Zn corrosion. Benefiting from the mutual enhancement of KMnO and I− electrolytes, the Zn-I2-Mn hybrid battery thus achieves exceptional areal capacity and durability. 4 Conclusions In summary, KMnO nanosheet arrays have been successfully fabricated in situ on CC and employed as a high-efficiency positive electrode for aqueous Zn-I2-Mn hybrid batteries. The CC@KMnO positive electrode not only contributes to capacity but also enhances the adsorption of iodine species and lowers the Gibbs free energy change of PDS for iodine reduction reaction, thereby boosting iodine reduction reaction and suppressing polyiodide shuttle and corrosion effect. Synchronously, the ZnI2 electrolyte facilitates the dissolution of residual and exfoliated KMnO, ensuring excellent reversibility of manganese redox reactions. Benefiting from the synergistic interplay, the Zn-I2-Mn hybrid battery delivers a high areal capacity of 2.02 mAh cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2 and maintains 1.74 mAh cm−2 even at 15 mA cm−2. Remarkably, 92% of its capacity is retained with the hybrid battery after 3600 cycles at 2 mA cm−2, outperforming most reported Zn-I2 and Zn-Mn devices. This work provides a captivating strategy for designing highly efficient and long-lasting hybrid batteries.

        "dc:description": "Aqueous Zn-I2-Mn hybrid batteries demonstrate enhanced capacity, superior redox reaction kinetics, and prolonged cycle life compared to their Zn-I2 and Zn-Mn counterparts, making them promising candidates for grid-scale energy storage. Nevertheless, challenges remain in developing multifunctional positive electrode materials and elucidating the mechanistic synergy governing iodine and manganese redox reactions. Herein, we present a high-performance free-standing electrode composed of birnessite (KMnO) nanosheet arrays in situ grown on carbon cloth (CC@KMnO) for constructing a Zn-I2-Mn hybrid battery. Combined theoretical studies and in situ characterizations reveal that CC@KMnO enhances iodine species adsorption, lowers the Gibbs free energy change for iodine reduction, and significantly accelerates I−/I3 −/I5 − redox kinetics while suppressing polyiodide shuttling and corrosion effects. Synchronously, the ZnI2 electrolyte facilitates the dissolution of residual and exfoliated KMnO, thereby improving manganese redox reaction kinetics, reversibility, and enhancing cycling stability. Leveraging this mutually reinforcing effect, the Zn-I2-Mn hybrid battery achieves an impressive areal capacity of 2.02 mAh cm−2 and maintains long-term durability over 3600 cycles at 2 mA cm−2. This work provides valuable insights into designing efficient and durable hybrid energy storage systems.",
