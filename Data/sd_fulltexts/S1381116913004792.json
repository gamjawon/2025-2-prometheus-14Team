Graphical abstract The spillover of hydrogen from Ni to Cu was directly observed on bimetallic Ni–Cu thin films and nanoparticles by hydrogen temperature programmed desorption (TPD) via depositing Cu atoms onto Ni surfaces precovered with atomic hydrogen. The spillover of hydrogen between metals could result in over counting of active sites by hydrogen selective adsorption methods, and also provides a new concept for catalyst design. Keywords Hydrogen spillover Bimetallic catalyst Nickel Copper Hydrogen selective adsorption 1 Introduction Hydrogen spillover has been widely studied in catalysis and hydrogen storage [1,2]. Most of them focused on the spillover of hydrogen activated on metal clusters to supports [1–5]. The studies on the spillover of hydrogen between metals are limited, because hydrogen molecules dissociate readily on most of the transition metals. There is one exception that hydrogen is activated adsorption on Group IB metals (Cu, Ag, and Au) with a dissociation barrier larger than 0.4eV [6]. However, hydrogen adatoms can be formed and stabilized on these IB metals by first dissociating the H2 in the gas phase [7–9]. Therefore, one question is aroused that what will happen in hydrogen adsorption on the bimetallic catalysts composed with active transition metals (TM) and less active Group IB metals (IBM). One typical alloy system contains Group VIII and Group IB metals [10–13], like nickel–copper (Ni–Cu). Hydrogen can be activated on TM sites, and then spills over to the nearby IBM sites [14]. Goodman and co-workers first noticed that hydrogen adatoms bound to ruthenium (Ru) sites can spill over onto Cu sites in Ru–Cu bimetallic model catalysts [15]. The spillover of hydrogen from Ru to Cu was also confirmed by an NMR study [16]. Most recently the spillover of atomic hydrogen from palladium (Pd) atoms to nearby Cu atoms was imaged by scanning tunneling microscopy [17,18]. These observations challenge the interpretations of the catalytic studies based on the surface composition of bimetallic catalysts determined by the selective H2 chemisorptions assuming no uptake of hydrogen on the less active metal sites [13], and also open up a new avenue for catalyst design [17–20]. Sykes and co-workers have demonstrated that a highly effective and selective hydrogenation catalyst can be prepared by modification of Cu surfaces with minority Pd atoms due to hydrogen spillover from Pd to Cu [17,18,21]. Similar catalytic system consisting of an active Group VIII transition metal and a less active Group IB metal has potential applications for the design of highly selective catalyst [12,22–24]. In this study, we chose Ni–Cu bimetallic catalysts, as a prototype to study the spillover of hydrogen on TM-IBM bimetallic catalysts. There is no direct evidence reported that hydrogen can spill over from Ni to Cu for this widely studied bimetallic catalyst. Ni and Cu are two typical representative metals for non-activated and activated hydrogen adsorption, respectively. The spillover of hydrogen adatoms on Ni sites to Cu sites usually is not energetically favored due to the higher binding energy of hydrogen to Ni (2.89eV) than hydrogen to Cu (2.39eV) [25]. Herein, we studied the possibility of the spillover of hydrogen from Ni to Cu by depositing atomic Cu on Ni precovered with activated atomic hydrogen, and got direct evidence that hydrogen atoms could spill over from Ni to Cu. This observation is against the assumption that no hydrogen uptake on Cu in hydrogen selective adsorptions on Ni–Cu bimetallic catalysts [13,26]. 2 Experimental The experiments were performed in a stainless steel ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) system (base pressure of 2×10−10 Torr) equipped with Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and a UTI 100 mass spectrometer [23]. A linear ramp of 10K/s was used for TPD measurements. A Mo(110) used as a substrate for preparation of SiO2 thin films was mounted to tantalum wires at the bottom of the sample manipulator. The sample temperature could be varied from 80K to 2300K by combined resistive/e-beam heating and liquid nitrogen (LN2) cooling. The sample temperature was measured using a W-5%Re/W-26%Re C type thermocouple spot-welded on the back of the Mo single crystal. The Mo(110) was cleaned by repeated cycles of annealing at 1200K in 1×10−6 Torr O2 with a subsequent flash to 2200K until no contamination was detected by AES. Ultra-thin SiO2 films (∼10nm) were prepared by depositing Si in 1×10−5 Torr O2 at room temperature and subsequently annealed to 1200K for 10min [23]. Ni and Cu were evaporated from home-made dosers consisting of a tantalum wire filament wrapped with high pure metal wires. The amount of metal deposited was controlled by depositing time, calibrated with AES spectra, and was given in the unit of monolayer (ML=1.43×1015 at./cm2). Ultrahigh purity H2 (Matheson Tri-Gas) was used as received. The typical hydrogen exposure pressure was ∼10−7 Torr. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Energetic analysis of hydrogen spillover from Ni to Cu In order to experimentally observe a hydrogen spillover, the process should be thermodynamically and kinetically favored. Fig. 1 shows the potential energy diagram of hydrogen adsorption on Ni, Cu and Ni–Cu surfaces. The hydrogen adsorption energies and activation barriers were taken from reported results [17,25]. Hydrogen molecules readily adsorb dissociatively on Ni surfaces, while there is an about 0.4eV barrier for activated hydrogen adsorption on Cu surfaces. The large difference of the binding energies of hydrogen bound to Ni and Cu makes the spillover of hydrogen from Ni to Cu energetically unfavored. However, as shown in Fig. 1, if the hydrogen adatoms on Ni sites could be supplemented from gas phase hydrogen after the hydrogen adatoms spill over from hydrogen saturated Ni to Cu, the whole process is thermodynamically favored, giving that the hydrogen dissociative adsorption on Cu is exothermic process (0.2eV). The spillover of hydrogen from Ni to adjacent Cu could be facilitated by increasing the chemical potential of hydrogen on Ni, which could be achieved by increasing hydrogen adsorption pressure and temperature, or weakening the interaction between Ni and hydrogen. 3.2 TPD studies of hydrogen spillover from Ni to Cu Hydrogen adsorption on Ni surface is a non-activated process. Hydrogen readily dissociates into atomic hydrogen on Ni surfaces even at a low temperature of 100K [27,28]. From the above energetic analysis, it can be seen the Ni surface should be saturated during the whole hydrogen spillover process. In order to test the possibility of the spillover of hydrogen from Ni to Cu, the Ni surfaces were firstly saturated with atomic hydrogen, and subsequently atomic Cu was deposited on Ni precovered with atomic hydrogen. H2 TPD was used to follow the surface adsorption process. Fig. 2a shows H2 TPD of a 10 monolayer Ni/Mo(110) film precovered with saturated hydrogen, and followed with deposition of Cu at different coverages at about 100K. H2 TPD from clean Ni films shows two H2 desorption peak at 360K and 417K, which looks similar to H2 TPD from Ni(111) [23,27]. After a deposition of 0.4ML Cu onto the hydrogen saturated Ni thin film at 100K, a new H2 desorption peak appears at 268K. With a further increase of the deposited Cu to 1.4ML, the lower H2 desorption peak becomes dominated at the cost of the hydrogen desorption peak at 360K and 417K, and slightly shifts to 278K. It has been reported H2 desorbs from Cu surfaces between 250K and 350K by dosing atomic hydrogen on Cu surfaces [8]. The newly formed H2 desorption peak at 278K is within this hydrogen desorption temperature range, and can be assigned to H2 desorption from Cu surface. It is noted that the total desorption intensities of the TPD spectra are not affected by the adding of Cu atoms. This observation shows direct evidence of the complete spillover of hydrogen from Ni to Cu. Similar experiments were carried out on Ni–Cu nanoparticles supported on SiO2/Mo(110) (Fig. 2b). H2 TPD from 5ML Ni/SiO2/Mo(110) saturated with hydrogen at 100K shows three peaks at 267K, 358K and 415K, which are attributed to H2 desorption from different surface sites on Ni nanoparticles [23]. After a deposition of different coverage of Cu on hydrogen saturated 5ML Ni/SiO2 at about 100K, a new H2 desorption peak at 317K develops, which looks like H2 desorption from Cu(110) covered with pre-activated hydrogen [8]. The hydrogen desorption on Cu from Ni–Cu nanoparticles occurs at higher temperature than that from Ni–Cu thin films. It has been reported that hydrogen desorbs at a higher temperature on more open Cu(110) surfaces than on close packed Cu(111) surfaces [8]. On Ni–Cu nanoparticles more uncoordinated Cu sites and more open Cu terrace surfaces can be reasonably expected compared to Ni–Cu thin films where the surface atoms prefer to a close packed (111) surface [23]. Again, this result shows that the spillover of hydrogen from Ni to Cu can happen on Ni–Cu bimetallic nanoparticles as well as on Ni–Cu thin films. The processes are schematically shown on top of each TPD spectra in Fig. 2. 3.3 Hydrogen adsorption on Ni–Cu bimetallic catalysts As a comparison, hydrogen adsorption on Ni–Cu bimetallic thin films and nanoparticles were studied by H2 TPD under UHV conditions (Fig. 3 ). A Ni–Cu thin film was prepared by depositing 1.4ML Cu on a 10ML Ni/Mo(110), and subsequently annealed at 700K for 5min. Hydrogen adsorption was performed at 100K with extended long exposure of hydrogen to make sure the surface saturated with hydrogen. On the 1.4ML Cu/10ML Ni/Mo(110) bimetallic thin film, only a weak hydrogen desorption peak at 378K is detected with its intensity of about 6% of that from the clean Ni thin film (Fig. 3a). These observations are consistent with reported results that Cu mainly blocks the surface site of Ni, and no hydrogen spillover is observed under UHV conditions [14]. Compared to the TPD trace in Fig. 2a of depositing 1.4ML Cu on the hydrogen precovered Ni thin film, again it is proved that the desorption peak at 278K in Fig. 2a is caused by hydrogen desorption from Cu surface, not from Ni modified by Cu. The large difference in H2 desorption intensity of these two TPD traces (Figs. 2a and 3a) indicates a big discrepancy could occur in the selective hydrogen titration of Ni sites on Ni–Cu bimetallic catalysts depending on the adsorption conditions. Simililar results were also observed for hydrogen adsorption on Ni–Cu nanoparticles supported on SiO2/Mo(110) prepared by depositing 1ML Cu on 5ML Ni/SiO2 and subsequently annealed at 700K for 5min. H2 TPD (Fig. 3b) shows a much weaker desorption peak at 347K on the Ni–Cu nanoparticles compared to the corresponding TPD trace in Fig. 2b. These TPD results indicate hydrogen selectively adsorbs on Ni, and there is no hydrogen spillover on Ni–Cu bimetallic catalysts under UHV conditions. Hydrogen spillover from Ni to Cu requires over saturated hydrogen adsorption on Ni sites, as the case studied in Fig. 2, which is not available for hydrogen adsorption under UHV conditions. The selective adsorption of hydrogen on Ni under UHV conditions provides a method to titrate the surface Ni atoms on Ni–Cu bimetallic catalysts. However, this validation cannot be extended to the ambient pressure conditions, which is usually used for characterization of supported bimetallic catalysts. At elevated hydrogen pressure and temperature, the spillover of hydrogen from Ni to Cu is very likely to happen. Crucq and coworkers had proposed that spillover of hydrogen from Ni to Cu in the Ni–Cu alloy catalysts in order to explain their hydrogen isotherm results [29]. 4 Conclusions In this study, direct evidence of the spillover of hydrogen from Ni to Cu was observed via depositing Cu atoms on Ni precovered with hydrogen atoms. The spillover of hydrogen between metals could result in a failure in the measurement of the active sites by the selective hydrogen adsorption under ambient conditions, especially on TM-IBM bimetallic catalysts, e.g. Ni–Cu. Under UHV conditions, hydrogen still selectively adsorbs at Ni sites on Ni–Cu bimetallic catalysts. The observation of hydrogen spillover between metals reminds us that the less active metals in bimetallic catalysts could play a more important role in catalytic reactions rather than routinely considered as dilute agents, such as acting as a receiver to collect hydrogen or other reaction intermediates activated on adjacent active metal atoms.
