SO (1989) 343 - 353 343 AN IN SITU FT-IR STUDY OF ADSORBED SPECIES ON A Cu-ZnAl204 METHANOL CATALYST UNDER 1 MPa PRESSURE AND AT 525 K: EFFECT OF THE HZ/CO/CO; FEED STREAM COMPOSITION J. SAUSSEY and J. C. LAVALLEY Laboratoire de Spectrochimie, U.A. CNRS 04 414, ISMRa. University de Caen, 14032 Caen Cedex (France) (Received April 29, 1988; accepted July 18,1988) Summary An IR cell which can be used as a continuous flow reactor up to 1 MPa and 525 K is described. Application to the methanol synthesis from CO + CO; + H; reaction on a 15% Cu ZnAl204 catalyst shows that two different mechanisms of CH30H formation occur, depending on the gas feed composi- tion. With no CO;, ZnAlj04 plays an important role and ZnAl204 bidentate formate and methoxy species are intermediate. In the CO; + Ha case, the reaction principally occurs on the copper sites, with copper formate species as intermediate. The maximum activity composition (H;;:CO:C02 = 67:30:3) does not correspond to a maximum in the number of adsorbed species, what- ever their nature. In such a case, a mechanism close to that occurring with CO + Hz is suggested; the higher catalyst activity can possibly be related to the formation of a small amount of water, facilitating the desorption of ZnAl204 methoxy species by hydrolysis. Introduction Transmission FT-IR spectroscopy has very often been used to charac- terize the nature and the structure of adsorbed species on heterogeneous catalysts. Some species play an important role as intermediates in the studied process, and their detection provides very useful access to the reaction mech- anism. For instance, on Kadox-15 ZnO, formyi species have been evidenced from the CO + H; interaction at 240 K. Their evolution into methoxy species without formate formation has allowed us to propose a mechanism for the conditions used [1]. However, such conditions are quite different from those required for the synthesis of methanol. We therefore developed a system with an IR cell which can be used as a continuous flow reactor up to 1 MPa and 525 K. The cell works as a reactor, the pressed wafer being the catalyst, and simultaneously allows recording of the IR spectra of adsorbed species 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 344 during the reaction. Moreover, the results can be compared to those obtained from reactivity measurements, since the IR cell is coupled to an on-line gas chromatograph. We report in this paper the details of the system and the results obtained on a Cu ZnAl;04 catalyst by varying the composition of the Hz/CO/CO; mixture. There are indeed some discrepancies in the literature on the exact role of CO; in methanol synthesis on such catalysts. Some, like the ICI group [2], consider COy as the primary reactant, while others claim that its main role is to maintain the catalyst in a partially oxidized state for the enhancement of CO hydrogenation into methanol [3]. Experimental Design of a reactor for in situ FT-IR studies Several spectroscopic cells have already been developed for performing reaction studies at elevated pressures and temperatures [4 -10]. Amongst the cells, we chose to use one close to that described in [5]. Its main advantage is a short optical path length and a very low dead volume, which minimizes IB absorption due to the gas phase under pressure and favours contact between the reaction gas and the catalyst. The reactor cell (Fig. 1) was constructed of two flanges in brass to prevent metal carbonyl formation. On each flange, a CaF; window was sealed by a Kalrez 0-ring (DuPont). The seal between each flange was formed by a copper helicoflex seal. Catalyst samples were pressed into self- supporting disks of 16 mm diameter and ~0.2 mm thick, weighing 30 mg F DO MS Flux system Reactor cell 1. Heater 2. Sxagelok fitting 3. Helicoflex seal 4.

The reaction gases are introduced from one side of the sample holder; they are diverted onto both faces of the catalyst and are evacuated to the other side. A thermocouple was fixed on the upper side of the cell by a Swagelok fitting located in the sample holder. When the two flanges are assembled, the CaF; windows press directly against the sample holder. The optical path length between the windows is 2 mm and the wafer cavity volume is ~0.3 cm3. We tested the cell up to 3 MPa at the catalyst temperature of 575 K. without any problems. High pressure system A continuous flow system, shown in Fig. 1, was designed for catalytic studies at pressures from 0.1 to 3 MPa. The entire high pressure system was built directly on the FT-IR spectrometer in such a way that the system has a very low dead volume. This characteristic is particularly attractive for minimizing the residence time of reaction gas under pressure between the reactor cell and the chromatograph. Reaction products were quantitatively analysed with a gas chromatograph using thermal conductivity detectors (detection limit ^lO\"9 mol). Catalyst preparation Samples ZnAl;04 and 15% Cu/ZnAl;04 were prepared by the Institut Francais du Petrole (IFP) following the coprecipitation technique [11]. Precipitation of the metal nitrates (copper, aluminum, zinc) in 0.5 - 1.5 M aqueous solutions was carried out under controlled and constant pH condi- tions at temperatures between 333 and 363 K. The precipitate was subse- quently washed, dried and calcined at 623 K. FT-IR Samples (30 mg) were pressed into 16 mm diameter disks under a pressure of 25 MPa. Their activation was performed in the reactor cell, the samples being heated from room temperature to 525 K under a hydrogen flow (30 1 h~1 (g cat)\"1, 1 K min\"1, P= 0.1 MPa). Temperature was main- tained at 525 K for an additional 2 h, then the Ha pressure was increased to 1 MPa. This pressure was maintained for 30 min, then the spectrum of the activated catalyst (reference spectrum) was recorded. After that, the reac- tion gases were introduced, and IR spectra were recorded every 45 s, which corresponds to the accumulation of 30 scans with a 4 cnT1 resolution. When the steady state was reached, spectra were recorded every 10 min. Results Reactivity measurements The experiments were carried out under a total pressure of 1 MPa at 525 K with a gas flow of 15 cm3 min\"1 STP. The CO + COa/H; ratio was maintained constant (0.5) but the COa/CO; + CO amount, designated T, 346 300 -150 T .S .s ^ t Fig. 2. Variation of the composition of the gas phase at the steady state with the COa/ CO; + CO ratio. varied from 0 (pure CO) to 1 (pure CO;). Gas chromatographic analysis of the products in the steady state (after about a reaction time of 1 h) shows, aside from CO, CO; and H;, the formation of CH^OH, HaO and CHaOCE^. Variation of their amounts versus T is summarized in Fig. 2. In the case of the CO + H; mixture, only a very small amount of CO; (CO;/CO 2 X 10~3) is formed at the steady state, while from CO; + Hz, an appreciable amount of CO (CO/CO; 6.6 X 10~2) is formed. The meth- anol catalyst has a maximum activity when T is close to 0.1 (H2:CO:C02 = 67:30:3). The amount of water formed quickly increases with r. The water results from CO; reduction: CO, + 3H, ^ CHsOH + HaO and from the reverse water gas shift (RWGS): CO; + Hz ?==' CO + H; 0 The latter explains the CO formation from CO; + Hz. It also appears from Fig. 2 that CO; addition quickly decreases the formation of dimethyl ether, enhancing the catalyst selectivity. Such a maximum for methanol activity has already been reported [12, 13], and the feed gas composition was very close to that observed in the present study. In our conditions, the maximum methanol amount produced is 0.2 kg (kg cat)\"1 h~1, which is not very different from the observed amount (0.8 kg (kg cat)~1 h~1) using the same catalyst at 523 K under a pressure of 5 MPa in a liquid phase with the same feed composition [12]. Such results show that our IR cell can be used as a reactor. 347 IR study of adsorbed species The different species which can arise from CO + H; or COz + H; inter- action on the same catalyst have been reported in previous studies [14 -16]. Their characteristic bands in the conditions used in the present study are the following: (i) carbonate species (such as those residual after catalyst activation): two broad absorptions at 1610 and 1415 cm\"1 [15]; (ii) ZnAla04 formate species: CO; + H; reaction on the support, in the same conditions as those defined in the present paper, shows the presence of at least three types of formate type I: 2880, 2744, 1595 and 1375 cm~1, which are reduced by H;; type I': 1645 and 1320 cm\"1, always formed with species I and which have already been assigned by Amenomiya and Tagawa [20] as copper formate, but which are indeed related to the support; type II: 2894, 2767, 1590, 1390 and 1370 cm\"1, which are not reduced by H; in the conditions used (Fig. 3). The amount of ZnAlfO^ formate I and II species has been deduced from the intensity of the bands at 2744 and 2767 cm~1 respectively; (iii) Cu formate species leading to bands at 2925 and 2847 cm~1 (i/(CH) vibration in Fermi resonance interaction), 2692 cnT1 (2rs(C02~)) and 1352 cm-1 (Vs(CO^~)) [14,15]. Following the selection rule on metals [17]. the Vn(CO^~) and 6(CH) modes do not lead to any observable bands. Such characteristics are similar to those observed from EELS [18, 19]. The amount of copper formate species has been deduced from the intensity of the overtone at 2692 cm~1; .ors 31,55i$900>-5^5gi wavenumbers (cm1) Fig. 3.

IR results on Cu (100) surface showed [21, 22] corresponding bands at 2901, 2861 and 2787 cm\"1 (v(CH^)) and 990 cm\"1 (v(CO)), the latter not being observed in the present study due to the lack of catalyst transparency below 1000 cm~1; (vi) Cu carbonyl species: CO coordination on copper leads to the appearance of a strong v(C=0) band at 2080 - 2120 cm~1. The wavenumber varies with the oxidation state of the copper sites (the lower the wavenum- ber, the higher the copper reduction state). Non-steady state conditions The spectrum of the catalyst after H; reduction presents rather strong bands due to carbonate and ZnA^O^ formate II species (Fig. 4a). Moreover, a strong band occurs at 3500 cm\"! characterizing hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl groups, with a shoulder near 3700 cm\"1 due to free hydroxyl groups. 4600'3o5o'2600'iooo wavenumbers (crrf1) Fig. 4.

A tran- sient formation of CO; gas (bands at 2365 and 2331 cm~1) occurs, but only in the first minutes after CO introduction. C02 formation is accompanied by the appearance of bands due to Cu formate and ZnAl204 formate I and I' species. All disappear after 15 min. In contrast, bands characteristic of ZnAl204 formate II species increase in intensity. ZnAl204 methoxy species begin to appear when the concentration of ZnAl204 formate I is maximum, and then quickly increase, at the expense of the latter (Fig. 5). 349 A 2250 1550 1350 1050 wavenumbers (cm1) Fig. 5.

The variation of the relative amount of different species with T is shown in Fig. 6.

Variation of the r(CO) wavenumber of copper carbonyl species with the CO;/ CO; + CO ratio. 0.3, followed by a plateau. The amount of carbonate species increases mono- tonically with T, while the amount of ZnAl204 methoxy species sharply decreases. Figure 7 shows that the v(CO) wavenumber of CO species coordinated on copper varies with T. The band is situated at 2078 cnT1 in the case of H; + CO, and at 2109 cm\"1 for H; + CO; one. This shift towards higher wavenumbers can be related to an increase in the oxidation state of the copper sites due to CO;. Note that when the catalyst activity is maximum (T = 0.1) the band is situated at 2087 cm~1, indicating a rather reduced state. Assuming that the extinction coefficient of the v(CO) band is indepen- dent of its wavenumber in the 2078 - 2108 cm\"1 range. Fig. 6 shows a quasi- monotonic decrease in the number of Cu carbonyl species when r increases. Reducibility of species by H^ To investigate the reducibility of species adsorbed on the catalyst in the steady state, the CO + CO; flow was removed while the total pressure was maintained at 1 MPa. Analysis of the IR spectra shows that (i) the Cu formate species vanish as soon as the CO; flow is stopped, (ii) the amount of ZnAl204 formate I and carbonate species decreases more slowly, and (iii) the ZnAl204 methoxy species are quite stable. Discussion Figure 2 clearly shows that the same amount of methanol is formed from CO + H; (r = 0) or CO; + H; (r = 1). Such a result differs from [23, 24] but is in agreement with Denise et al. [25], who also used a low copper content catalyst. Results from Barbier et al. [12] in the liquid phase also show that the catalyst used in the present study is active in the CO + H; transformation into methanol without CO; in the feed. The very small 351 amount of CO; found from CO + H; reaction in this study tends to indicate a mechanism different from that occurring with CO; + H;, the presence of CO in the latter case being explained by the RWGS reaction. The formation of CO; from CO + H; has been mainly observed in the non-steady state, at the beginning of the reaction. Experiments using C^O are in progress to determine which mechanism occurs, either the Boudouard reaction or an over-reduction of the catalyst by CO. Infrared spectra show that copper formate species are not present in the steady state from CO + H; reaction. In contrast, such species are observed as soon as CO; is present in the gas phase. Their number increases with T up to T= 0.5; in agreement with Chinchen et al. [2], we consider they act as methanol intermediates from CO; + H;. In the case of CO + H;, ZnAl;04 bidentate formate (I) species, formed probably via CO interaction with surface OH groups, are considered as inter- mediates, as for the ZnAla04 methoxy species, since in the non-steady state, the number of the former reaches a maximum and then decreases while 2nAl204 methoxy species appear. Their formation sites are therefore the same; we propose that the support plays the main role: CO H Hi OH ' i ' CHa (ZnA^) 0^' '^0 6 (ZnA^) (ZnAl204) In such a case, the role of copper would involve H} activation which favours the reducibility of ZnAl204 formate I species, since it has been observed that their reduction process is very slow on ZnAl204 without copper. The limiting step is the methoxy species desorption, as shown by their low activity towards Hz. In the C02 + H^ case, the number of ZnAl204 methoxy species is weak, which suggests that the reaction principally occurs on copper sites: H | CHa JC^ H, I H, COa+H > (T '0 > 0 > CHaOH + H Cu Cu Cu Cu The high activity of Cu methoxy species would explain the lack of their detection. Such a mechanism is in agreement with Chinchen's results [2]. Figure 6 shows that the maximum in catalyst activity (H2:CO:C02 = 67:30:3) does not correspond to a maximum number of adsorbed species, whatever their nature. The weak C02 proportion in the feed gas suggests a mechanism close to that proposed in the CO + H2 case. However, copper sites are in a higher oxidation degree, and moreover the presence of C02 induces the formation of water. Its formation certainly facilitates the desorp- tion of ZnAl204 methoxy species by hydrolysis, in agreement with literature 352 results [13, 26] that report a promoting effect of a small amount of water in the case of CO + H; reaction. We therefore conclude there are two different mechanisms depending on the feed gas composition. In the case of CO-rich gases the support plays an important role, while for COz-rich gases, the active sites are mainly asso- ciated with copper. In the case of intermediate composition, both mecha- nisms operate. However, the water level, which increases with T, tends to play an important role since it poisons the CO reduction [13, 23] without affecting the COa one [26]. These preliminary results show that our experimental system works as a reactor and allows catalyst activity measurements to be related to the nature and the relative number of adsorbed species observed during the reac- tion under pressure and at 525 K. It would be interesting to extend the study to other catalysts leading to the formation of higher alcohols to deter- mine the homologation mechanism.

Saussey J.C. Lavalley Laboratoire de Spectrochimie, U.A. CNRS 04 414, ISMRa, Université de Caen, 14032 Caen CédexFrance An IR cell which can be used as a continuous flow reactor up to 1 MPa and 525 K is described. Application to the methanol synthesis from CO + CO2 + H2 reaction on a 15% Cu—ZnAl2O4 catalyst shows that two different mechanisms of CH3OC formation occur, depending on the gas feed composition. With no CO2, ZnAl2O4 plays an important role and ZnAl2O4 bidentate formate and methoxy species are intermediate. In the CO2 + H2 case, the reaction principally occurs on the copper sites, with copper formate species as intermediate. The maximum activity composition (H2: CO: CO2 = 67:30:3) does not correspond to a maximum in the number of adsorbed species, whatever their nature. In such a case, a mechanism close to that occurring with CO + H2 is suggested; the higher catalyst activity can possibly be related to the formation of a small amount of water, facilitating the desorption of ZnAl2O4 methoxy species by hydrolysis.
