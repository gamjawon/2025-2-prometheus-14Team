A semibatch reactor, with a continuous feed of paraldehyde into a stirred system containing o- xylene and the catalyst, proved more convenient to obtain 1,1-bis(3,4-di-methylphenyl)ethane, because it assures a high o-xylene/acetaldehyde ratio. High selectivity was found in runs at 140, over zeolitic catalysts of type Y (dealuminated) or/3. Some catalyst deactivation was observed and a partial regeneration was found possible. Keywords: 1,1-bis(3,4-dimethylphenyl)ethane; Semibatch reactor; Solid acid catalysts; Zeolites 1. Introduction Oxidation of 1,1-bis (3,4-dimethylphenyl)ethane (DXE) is the key step for the production of 3,3',4,4'-benzophenone-tetracarboxyl-dianhydride, an important building block for polyimides and other thermoplastic materials with chemical inertness at high temperature [ 1-3]. Traditionally obtained by the Baeyer condensation of acetaldehyde with o-xylene in the presence of a large excess of sulphuric acid [4-8], DXE could be more conveniently prepared over solid acid catalysts, in that way avoiding the disposal of large quantities of spent sulphuric acid. Analogous condensations of aldehydes with aromatics over solid catalysts have been described [ 9,10]. In the present work, several acid solids were tested. Most of them are zeolites, which can be grouped as follows: faujasites of type X and Y, as such; three Y zeolites, dealuminated; a/3 * Corresponding author. Fax.

For the sake of com- parison, also some non-zeolitic solid acids were tested, namely Amberlyst 15 and two niobium catalysts. All catalysts are listed in Table 1. The dealuminated nature of HYD1 (LZY82) is not obvious, because of its low SIO2/A1203 ratio, but such a zeolite has been described as an ultrastable Y that contains extraframework aluminium [ 11 ]. 2. Experimental 2.1. Reactants and catalysts o-Xylene was a commercial product '99 + ', including (by our analytical method, vide infra) ca. 0.5% ofp-xylene and 4-ethyltoluene. It was distilled before use and kept over 3A zeolite beads. Acetaldehyde and paraldehyde were '99%' and '97 + %' products, respectively. Of the catalysts (see Table 1 ), H-ZSM-5 (24) and H-ZSM- 5 (81 ) have been previously employed by some of us under the symbols TEA-24/ 1 and TEA-8 l, respectively [ 12]; HYD2 was obtained by dealuminating LZY52 P. Beltrame et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 128 (1995) 143-154 145 by treatment with SiCI4 [13] and then effecting the exchange procedure through the ammonium form: the ratio SiO2/A1203 was determined by the usual gravimetric method [14]; H/3 has already been employed by one of us under the symbol BI [ 15]. The degree of exchange of sodium with hydrogen in zeolitic catalysts was determined by atomic absorption analysis after acid digestion [ 16]. Surface acidity was measured by titration with n-butylamine in an anhydrous solvent [ 17], using proper indicators. All catalysts were used as fine powders. 2.2. Reaction products Most products were identified by comparison with pure samples. Some of the latter were available as commercial products (crotonaldehyde, DXE), some other were prepared: methyl-(3,4-dimethylphenyl)carbinol was obtained from 3,4- dimethyl-acetophenone by hydrogenation on Raney nickel [ 18]; 3,4-dimethyls- tyrene (DMS) was obtained from the previous carbinol by heating in hexamethylphosphoramide and its hydrogenation over Pd/C afforded 3,4-dime- thylethylbenzene (DMEB) [ 19,20]. Some of the products were only partially char- acterized (by GC/MS analysis) but not exactly identified: unknown compound 'a' has re~e=210; unknown 'b' has m/e=224. Three other products were found to have m/e = 264 and their mass spectrum indicates that they are isomers of 4,4- bis ( 3,4-dimethylphenyl ) butene ( DXB ) : it was proved that they are the main prod- ucts when crotonaldehyde is made to condense with o-xylene. 2.3. Apparatus and procedure Reactions were carried out in a Pyrex reactor (100 cm3), with a thermostatic jacket, a reflux condenser, and a magnetic stirrer. A rubber septum fitted to a neck of the reactor allowed sampling by a syringe, control of temperature by a thermo- couple and, if required, feeding of a reactant. Some preliminary runs were batch reactions, with an initial charge containing both reactants (molar ratio o- xylene:acetaldehyde = ca. 50) and the catalyst. In all successive runs the flask was used as a semibatch reactor, with an initial loading of o-xylene and catalyst, and a continuous feeding of aldehyde from a metering pump (ISCO/~LC-500) through a microtube (0.25 mm I.D.) plunged into the system at time zero. The aldehyde was initially acetaldehyde; however, this very volatile liquid gave problems of irregular feed flow and was soon let aside, preferring a paraldehyde feed; in the acid environment of the runs, paraldehyde was found to dissociate immediately to acetaldehyde. Typical quantities were: catalyst 0.50 g; o-xylene 44 g; acetaldehyde 0.1-0.2 mmol/min; length of the semibatch phase 10-40 min, corresponding to a feeding of 2.5 mmol AA. Therefore the ratio of catalyst (500 mg) to total aldehyde fed ( 110 mg) was usually kept quite high, with the aim of maintaining the catalyst's final activity not much lower than the initial one, so avoiding accumulation of unreacted aldehyde and too low o-xylene:acetaldehyde ratios. 146 P. Beltrame et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 128 (1995) 143-154 Before use, catalysts were activated as summarized in Table 1. During a run, samples were withdrawn at known time values during the semibatch phase of the reaction. After stopping the continuous feed, a batch phase was allowed to proceed; some samples were taken also during this phase. Samples were collected into vials equipped with septum caps. At the end of each run, the reaction mixture was filtered and the catalyst washed with CH2CI> The samples taken, as well as the final solutions, were analyzed by GC, on a capillary column of SPB-5 (30 m long, 0.32 mm I.D., 0.25 /~m film), operated at temperatures from 20 to 230. Retention time values were from 4.50 to 42 rain. Since acetaldehyde (AA) was in every case the limiting reactant, fractional conversion was referred to the total AA fed up to each sampling time, while selectivities were referred to the difference between AA fed and AA analytically found at each time. The pump feed flow had been checked at room temperature using water and found substantially correct, with a maximum deviation of 3% (exptl. > theor.) when stirring was at the highest speed (1000 rpm). During runs with aldehyde feeding at 140, the starting of the semibatch phase was often characterized by an initial dropping into the reactor of very small amounts of paraldehyde in excess with respect to the nominal pump feed flow. This fact, revealed by the sum of selectivities exceeding unity for the first sample, was taken into account by correcting the aldehyde initially fed by such an amount (it was a matter of a few milligrams) as to obtain ~S-- 1 for the first sample. Apart from this, nominal pump rates were always employed. An example of a run, with ana- lytical details, is given in Table 2. Table 2 Example of reaction (run P8 with catalyst HYD3).

Results and discussion Preliminary batch runs evidenced that, while the desired reaction was: 2 o-xylene + acetaldehyde --* DXE + water the predominant reaction was usually the following: 2 acetaldehyde ~ crotonaldehyde + water although results could be improved by using a high reaction temperature (140). The desired reaction can reasonably be viewed as proceeding in several steps: protonation of the aldehyde, then attack of the aromatic ring of o-xylene giving rise to methyl-(3,4-dimethylphenyl)-carbinol and its derivatives, such as DMS and DMEB; further protonation and attack of a further molecule of o-xylene, to give DXE [ 10]. The autocondensation of acetaldehyde, under acid catalysis, is also a multistep process (protonation of the aldehyde, then attack of a second molecule of aldehyde in its enolic form, and so on, ending up in a crotonaldehyde molecule) [21 ]. Since both the desired and the undesired condensation involve the protonated aldehyde, a case of two competing reactions, giving rise to a desired product P and a by-product S, such as rl AAH+oX ~ P (1) r2 AAH+ +AA ~ S (2) appears as the simplest kinetic model of the system. In the present case, AA = acetaldehyde, AAH = its protonated form, oX = o-xylene, P = DXE (but also DMS and DMEB), S = crotonaldehyde (but also DXB). In a case like this, the larger the ratio CoX/CAA is, the higher is the selectivity of the desired reaction. However, molar ratios o-xylene/acetaldehyde around 50, as employed in the batch reactor, proved still insufficient to give reasonable selectivity to DXE. So we decided to move to a semibatch mode, with slow continuous feed of aldehyde into a large excess of o-xylene: this procedure gives a very large initial ratio of the reactants and, if chemical reactions steadily consume the aldehyde, such a ratio remains high during the entire run. The condition that chemical reactions steadily consume the aldehyde is of paramount importance, since at the temperature of the runs (80-140) acetaldehyde is very volatile and, if it does not quickly react, is easily lost. When using a semibatch reactor, the reaction at 140, over a few catalysts, gave no crotonaldehyde, while DXE usually became the main product. After some runs with acetaldehyde, which proved the advantages of the semi- batch procedure, acetaldehyde was replaced by paraldehyde and a screening pro- gram on several catalysts was undertaken, under standard conditions. Results are summarized in Table 3 for runs at 140, while a few runs at lower temperatures 148 P.

Of the various samples taken during each run and analyzed, only two are considered in the tables, the former referring to a low time value, the latter to the last sample taken during the semibatch phase of the run. This phase lasted less than one hour, more commonly 10 min: from the colour of the catalyst it was apparent that there was formation of carbonaceous deposits, and the succes- sive analyses usually confirmed that the catalyst had lost some of its activity, as evidenced by a lower conversion of the aldehyde into products. In Table 3, it can be noticed that the first five entries are of no interest, since (apart from some low values of the conversion and very large values of the losses of aldehyde) the selectivity to DXE in these cases is zero or close to zero. The last four zeolites (HYD3, HYD2, H/3 and HYD1 ), on the contrary, gave good conver- sions, limited losses, and selectivities to DXE (SDxE) from ca. 50 to ca. 95%. Results at lower temperatures (Table 4) show that, in comparison with runs at 140: in the case of H-ZSM-5 (24), there are lower losses, but this is not in favour of the desired product DXE, but rather of monocondensation products and croton- aldehyde; in the case of H/3, there are higher losses, larger fractions of by-products P.

It was so proved that the temperature has to be high in order to maximize the selectivity to DXE. Successive runs were carried out at 140, i.e. close to the boiling point of o-xylene. Of the four interesting catalysts, HYD3 was chosen for further runs, because of better availability, since it is a commercial zeolite (TSZ-360-HUD). A run with continuous feed of crotonaldehyde (0.0336 mmol/min) into the reactor, containing o-xylene (ca. 44 g) and HYD3 as catalyst, gave a conversion around 50%, and products mostly corresponding to a direct reaction of crotonal- dehyde with o-xylene, i.e. di-xylyl-butenes (DXB): these were, among the prod- ucts, a fraction in the range 70-80%. Other runs with catalyst HYD3 aimed at checking the effect of changing the contact time and the stirring speed. Longer contact times were obtained by using decreasing values of the feed flow (0.25; 0.125; 0.063 mmol AA/min), the amount of catalyst being constant (0.5 g). Table 5 shows that conversion values and selectivity to DXE increase, while losses decrease. Two runs were carried out with the lowest feed flow, but using a higher amount of catalyst ( 1.0 g): results were confirmed or slightly improved (Table 5). A run at a lower temperature (P11 at 110, to be compared with P8 at 140) gave worse results, since crotonaldehyde and losses were increased, while selectivity to DXE was markedly lowered (Table 5). All this again points to the need of reaction conditions ensuring that acetaldehyde reacts as quickly as possible after entering the reactor. The stirring speed was the variable explored in the runs summarized in Table 6: values from 450 to 1000 rpm were tested and results showed that apparent fractional conversions were all similar; as to selectivities, intermediate values of the stirring speed (650-850 rpm) seem to be preferable, giving higher yields of DXE and lower losses.

Selectivity towards DXE ([2), DMEB+DMS (0) and lost fractions of AA ( as a function of regeneration cycles of catalyst HYD3. Values were averaged over longer times samples (32 and 40 min) for two runs on fresh catalyst, four runs after 1 regeneration, two runs after 2 regenerations, and one run after 3 regener- ations. the fresh one. In particular, by considering the behaviour towards the end of the semibatch runs, it was found that after successive regeneration cycles the catalyst tended to give less DXE and more intermediates (DMS + DMEB ) ; also losses were increasing (Fig. 1). Some kinetic considerations are possible about the competition of condensations of types ( 1 ) and (2). Products of type P and S, as experimentally determined at a given time along the semibatch phase, approximately correspond to rates r~ and r2 at that time, i.e.: ( rl/r2) t,, -~ ( 'P' products/'S' products),. (3) Eq. (3) would be more appropriate under differential conditions, i.e. at almost constant values of CAA; under our experimental conditions, it represents a rough approximation, sufficient for order-of-magnitude calculations. It can be considered that for the competing reactions (1) and (2) it is: rl = k~ CAAH + Cox and r2 = k2CAAH + CAA; of course the formation of DXE requires a further step, with a second molecule of o-xylene, but this can be taken as a fast step, since the amount of intermediate products is generally much lower than that of DXE, at least with the best catalysts. It is then: ( Q / r2),,,= ( klC()x/k2CAA)t,, (4) Since reactions are isothermal: ( rl/r2),, = (kl/k2) \" ( Cox/ CAA)tn (5) 152 P.

The best catalysts were characterized by ratios (Cox~ CAA) of the order of 103 and ratios ( 'P' products/'S' products) of the order of 102, while other catalysts had lower values of the former ratio and much lower values of the latter. As a consequence, ratios kl/k2 were found to be around 0.03 for HYD2, HYD1 and HYD3 (when fresh; around 0.02 for regenerated HYD3); the less selective catalysts (HY, H-ZSM-5(24), HX, A15, NB-P) showed values kl/k2 of the order of 10-3 and even less; zeolite H/3 was in between. This is summarized, for runs at 140, in Fig. 2, where average values are represented, since, within experimental uncertainty, values of kt/k2 were not dependent on tn and could be averaged for runs on a given catalyst at a given temperature. A good level of catalyst activity is strictly required for this process, since only a very active catalyst can leave so little unreacted acetaldehyde as to cause a suffi- ciently high Cox/CAA ratio, in order to favour useful products at the expenses of crotonaldehyde and its derivatives. However, also a relatively high kl/k2 ratio is a necessary condition for reaching good selectivity. In terms of catalyst properties, P. Beltrame et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 128 (1995) 143-154 153 an adequate acidity is obviously required, but the best catalysts are not at the top of the scale of acid titre (Table 1 ): on the contrary, they are characterized by a rather low acid titre (Table 1 ). Analyzing the results, structural properties appear to be important: non-zeolitic catalysts, such as A15, NB-O and NB-P, had scarce or no selectivity to DXE; so, an ordered zeolitic structure is advantageous for the desired process. However, zeolites of the MFI type [H-ZSM-5(24) and H-ZSM-5(81 )] gave no DXE: this is evidence that 10-ring channels do not fit for the desired condensation, the product of which (a dixylylethane) is rather cumbersome. The fauj asitic structure, with its 12-ring pores (7.4 .~ diameter) and supercages (13 ,~ diameter) [22], seems not by itself sufficient, since HX and HY were not good catalysts (in the case of HY, it should also be remarked that its degree of decationation was much lower than for other zeolites, as shown in Table 1 ). A faujasitic structure, as modified by dealu- mination, seems to be required: such a structure is usually associated with a rela- tively high SIO2/A1203 ratio, as for HYD3 and HYD2, but it can occasionally be associated with a low ratio, as for HYD 1, if extraframework aluminium is present [ 11 ]. Results by Climent et al., who used dealuminated Y zeolites [ 10], are in line with this hypothesis. The other good catalyst, the zeolite H/3, has the structure of Tschernichite, with pores comparable to those of Faujasite (7.6 6.4 A) in only one direction, others being smaller [23-25] ; it has a rather high SIO2/A1203 ratio [25]. Due to their high SiO2/AI203 ratio (at least, the framework ratio), dealuminated HY catalysts and H/3 present a low acid titre, that is a low density of acid sites. This seems to confer them relatively high values of kl/k2, favouring the condensation of acetaldehyde with o-xylene rather than the autocondensation to crotonaldehyde. This might be correlated with the difference in size between o-xylene and acetal- dehyde and with the spatial requirements of the several intermediates and transition states for the formation of the final product DXE. Furthermore, too high a density of acid sites, able to adsorb the aldehyde by protonation, could also favour the condensation to crotonaldehyde. 4. Conclusions The condensation of acetaldehyde with o-xylene, to give 1,1-bis (3,4-dimethyl- phenyl)ethane (DXE) is possible over a few of the most common solid acid catalysts, in particular over dealuminated Y zeolites and/3 zeolite. Although in any case the kinetic coefficients would favour the autocondensation of the aldehyde to crotonaldehyde, the desired reaction can take place with a good selectivity (over 90%) by using a semibatch reactor, where the ratio o-xylene/acetaldehyde (Cox/ CAA) can be maintained at levels of the order of 103, as long as the catalyst is active. Owing to the very low values of the acetaldehyde concentration, under these 154 P. Beltrame et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 128 (19951 143-154 conditions losses due to volatility and formation of carbonaceous deposits can be kept low.

Condensation of acetaldehyde with ortho-xylene was carried out in the presence of solid acid catalysts, in spite of the strongly competitive autocondensation of acetaldehyde to give crotonaldehyde. A semibatch reactor, with a continuous feed of paraldehyde into a stirred system containing o-xylene and the catalyst, proved more convenient to obtain 1,1-bis(3,4-di-methylphenyl)ethane, because it assures a high o-xylene/acetaldehyde ratio. High selectivity was found in runs at 140°C, over zeolitic catalysts of type Y (dealuminated) or β. Some catalyst deactivation was observed and a partial regeneration was found possible.
