Lithium sulfur batteries (LSBs) draw extensive interest because of the ultra-high capacity and low material cost. However, the sluggish lithium polysulfides (LIPSs) conversion processes are detrimental to cycle stability and rate capability, inhibiting the commercial application of LSBs. Here we present the well-designed FeCo alloy catalysts anchored on porous carbon (FeCo-C) as sulfur host to improve the electrochemical performance by accelerating the conversion reactions. The FeCo alloy demonstrates high catalytic effect and strong adsorption capability of LIPSs, in which potential polarization can be greatly decreased and “shuttle effects” can be largely avoided. As a result, the obtained S/FeCo-C composites show an initial specific capacity of 791.9 mAh g−1 at a large current density of 2 C and maintain 502.5 mAh g−1 even after 500 cycles. Moreover, 720 mAh g−1 (corresponding to 70% retention) can be achieved after 100 cycles at 0.2 C with a high sulfur content of 80 wt%, enabling high sulfur utilization. This work not only provides a new insight to investigate the conversion kinetics of LiPSs, but also opens up a new avenue for advanced lithium sulfur batteries. Graphical abstract A promising FeCo alloy catalyst which enhances redox kinetics of polisulfide conversion and chemisorption effects of lithium polysulfides is well designed for advanced lithium sulfur batteries. Image, graphical abstract Keywords Lithium sulfur batteries FeCo alloys Catalysts Adsorption Porous carbon 1 Introduction Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) are widely regarded as one of the most promising next generation energy storage systems due to its high energy density (2600 Wh kg−1 based on S) and low cost of S [1–6], which show great prospects in the emerging fields such as unmanned aerial vehicle, underwater robots, extended-range electric vehicles and energy storage power station in the isolated island [7,8]. Up to date, although tremendous progress in LSBs has been made, the practical application of LSBs is still hindered by the main problem of “shuttle effects” caused by the soluble intermediate lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), which leads to low specific capacity, poor cyclic stability and low Coulombic efficiency [9–11]. To address the above issue, the most popular strategy is focused on strong physical or chemical adsorption to prevent LiPSs diffusion [12,13], which, however, might only partially solve the problem [14,15]. Theoretically, three quarters of the LSBs’ capacity can be attributed to the transformation of soluble LiPSs to solid Li2S [16,17], therefore achieving fast reaction kinetics is beneficial for high reversible capacity [14,18]. However, the practically sluggish process inevitably leads to the accumulation of soluble LiPSs in the cathode region, resulting in their diffusion to anode area and losing electrical contact with electrode. Furthermore, such detrimental results are more pronounced with higher sulfur content, which usually cause lower sulfur utilization as well as lower capacity [15]. Since dissolution of LiPSs is inevitable and the content of sulfur species is much higher than that of matrix (or adsorption sites), the soluble LiPSs are difficult to be physical and chemical confined due to the adsorption saturation and sluggish conversion reaction [19]. Most recently, introduction of high activity catalysts in the cathode to accelerate the conversion rates of soluble LiPSs and reduce the “shuttle effects” has attracted increasing attention [19–27]. Furthermore, it has been shown that catalysts can demonstrate low overpotential and enhanced rate capability. Until now, transition metal compounds, metals and metal-free materials have been investigated as catalysts to improve the electrochemical performance. For example, Arava's group employed the noble metal platinum (Pt) as the catalyst, and it is shown that Pt promotes the conversion of soluble LiPSs to Li2S (Li2S2) and the transformation of Li2S (Li2S2) to long-chain LiPSs [28]. Lee and co-workers prepared a rGO decorated with few-layer MoS2 nanoflakes with a controlled amount of sulfur deficiency (MoS2− x /rGO) as the sulfur host [23]. It is confirmed that the polysulfides conversion kinetics is significantly enhanced. Yang's team designed a 3D hierarchical porous graphene macrostructure coupled with Fe2O3 NPs, which not only strongly interacts with LiPSs, but also promotes the slow electrochemical process of polysulfides conversion, and hence restrains the “shuttle effects” [20]. Yang and co-authors prepared a porous nitrogen-doped carbon with single-atomic iron active sites, in which the single-atomic Fe served as catalyst to accelerate the polysulfide redox kinetics [22]. Sun's group reported that both VO2−VN and VTe2@MgO heterostructure could serve as effective mediators with adsorptive and electrocatalytic activity for LiPS regulation [29,30]. These above studies indicate that catalysts can greatly improve the redox reaction kinetics in LSBs. Basically, several factors should be considered for advanced catalysts, those are high catalytic activity, high electrical conductivity, strong interaction with LIPSs and low material cost [31,32]. However, the research on the catalysts and their catalytic effects on LiPSs conversion is still in an infant stage, which the catalysis mechanism remains unclear. In the search for an efficient and cost-effective catalysts, transition metals-based alloys (TMAs) with their unique electronic and chemical properties compared to their monometallic components have drawn much attention and been expected to be good selectivity, high activity and strong stability [33–37]. Compared with single metal, it is proved that enhancement of the catalytic performance can be achieved by incorporating another metal forming more complicated alloy nanoparticles in the catalysts. In fact, TMAs have already been widely applied as catalysts in a range of reactions, such as hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, fuel cells and metal-air batteries [38,39]. Peng's group designed and prepared a porous Co x Sn y alloy-based cathode, which not only shows high specific capacity, superior rate capacity and good long-term cycling stability, but also reduces the polarization during cycling [24]. However, Co x Sn y alloys shows weak catalytic effect besides its high material cost and complex synthetic procedure. But it should be noted that the activity might vary with the elemental composition of the TMAs nanoparticles. Taking above considerations into account, designing a low-cost TMAs based cathode materials with strong catalytic effect is possible and essential to develop high-performance LSBs. It is well known that metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with multiple composition are promising precursors to fabricate transition metal alloy nanoparticles. Our group previously prepared Prussian blue analogues (PBAs, Na2M[Fe(CN)6]⋅ nH2O, M=Fe, Ni, Co, Cu) with precisely controlled elemental composition and micro-structures for energy storage applications [40,41]. Herein, we demonstrate that the FeCo alloys derived from PBAs can greatly accelerate redox kinetics of polysulfide conversion and establish strong adsorption effects of LiPSs. Furthermore, FeCo in-situ deposition on the porous carbon (FeCo-C) enables uniform distribution and intimate contact, which is beneficial to the interfacial charge transfer. The symmetrical cells tests demonstrate that FeCo-C electrode displays much larger redox current compared to the pure C symmetrical cell, suggesting rapid kinetics of Li2S6 conversion on the FeCo-C electrode. Consequently, the as resulted S/FeCo-C composites show an initial specific capacity of 791.9 mAh g−1 at a large current density of 2 C and can still maintain 502.5 mAh g−1 even after 500 cycles. The capacity decay rate is 0.073% per cycle and Coulombic efficiency of nearly 100% is maintained during the whole cycle process. More significantly, even at a high sulfur content of 80 wt%, a reversible capacity of 720 mAh g−1 (corresponding to 70% retention) can be achieved after 100 cycles at 0.2 C, enabling high sulfur utilization. As a contrast, the S/C and single metal based S/Fe-C cathodes demonstrate much poorer electrochemical performance. This work may provide a new strategy to overcome the “shuttle effects” and enhance reaction kinetics for high energy LSBs. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials preparation Preparation of porous carbon: 20 g of wheat flour was dispersed in 200 mL distill water and stirred for 5 min, at the same time 20 g KOH was completely dissolved in 50 mL distill water. The obtained KOH solution was poured into the flour suspension solution and rapidly stirred for 30 min. The product was dispersed by ultrasound for 10 min, then dried at 60 °C for 24 h and carbonized in a tube-furnace at 700 °C for 3 h with a heating rate of 8 °C min−1 in the argon atmosphere. After naturally cooled, the obtained active porous carbon (C) was washed thoroughly with distill water to remove residual KOH and other impurities until the pH value is 7. Finally, the washed carbon was dried in air at 60 °C for 24 h. In-situ fabrication of FeCoPBA-C and FeCo-C: In a typical procedure, 1 mmol Na4[Fe(CN)6]·10H2O and 1 mmol CoCl2·6H2O was respectively dissolved in 50 mL distilled water, while 200 mg of porous C was evenly dispersed into 100 mL distilled water. The obtained Na4[Fe(CN)6] and CoCl2 solutions were pumped to the porous C suspension at a rate of 0.33 mL min−1. Finally, the precipitate was centrifuged, washed and dried to obtain Na2CoFe(CN)6·10H2OC (FeCoPBA-C). The CoFePBA-C was heated in a tube-furnace at 900 °C for 2 h in the argon atmosphere to obtain the composite of FeCo alloys and C (FeCo-C). PB-C and Fe-C were prepared in the same condition. Synthesis of S/FeCo-C: The S/CoFe-C was prepared by a simple melt-diffusion method. In brief, sublimed sulfur powders and FeCo-C was mixed (usually weight ratio of 6:4, and 8:2 for high sulfur content) and ground in an agate mortar, then the mixture was heated at 155 °C for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the S/FeCo-C was obtained. As a contrast, S/C and S/Fe-C was obtained in the same way. 2.2 Materials characterization The crystalline phase was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Rigalcu smartlab-9KW diffractometer equipped with Cu K α radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) at a scan range of 10°‒90° JSM-6701F scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL, Japan) and GeminiSEM 300 (ZEISS) was conducted to characterize the surface morphology. The microstructure and morphology were further investigated by the TEM using Talos F200X (Thermo Fisher). The specific surface areas and pore volumes were characterized by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 to 500 °C in the nitrogen atmosphere on a Micromeritics (TriStar II 3flex). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB250Xi, Thermo Fisher, US) was used to study the electronic structure and determine chemical components of the carbon surface. The sulfur content in the S/C composites was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C/min from room temperature to 500 °C, performed on a synchronous thermal analyzer (TGA4000, Perkin Elmer, US). The Raman spectrum was performed with a WITec alpha300 R. 2.3 Electrochemical measurement The as-prepared cathode materials of S/FeCo-C, S/C and S/Fe-C were mixed with Ketjen Black and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) at a weight ratio of 7:2:1 (8:1:1 for high sulfur content of S/FeCo-C cathodes) and then N-2-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) was added dropwise to prepare a slurry, which was evenly coated on aluminum foil, followed by drying at 60 °C for 20 h in the air, and then punched into cathodes. The electrochemical properties were tested by using CR2025 coin cells, which were assembled in an argon filled glove box, where moisture and oxygen were both below 1 ppm. The electrolyte was 1 M bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonimide) (LiTFSI) with 1 wt% LiNO3 in the mixture of 1, 3-dioxolane (DOL) and ethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DME) (1:1, v/v). The electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio was around 25 μL mg−1. The galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were evaluated on the battery testing system (Land CT2001A) in the voltage range of 1.8‒2.8 V. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 604E, shanghai, China) at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s −1 between 1.8 and 2.8 V. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured on electrochemical workstation (GAMRY Reference 600 plus, US) at frequencies between 0.01 Hz and 10 kHz with an amplitude of 5 mV. In this work, the current and capacities were calculated based on the mass of sulfur (1‒1.5 mg cm−2). 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 illustrates the main procedures in the preparation of S/FeCo-C. Firstly, three-dimensional (3D) porous carbon (C) with high specific area was rationally designed by an activation reaction and then carbonization process. Afterwards, a controlled coprecipitation method was conducted by constant dropping Na4[Fe(CN)6] and CoCl2 solutions into the porous C suspension, during which FeCoPBA dynamic process was modified to achieve uniform distribution and intimate contact with C. The obtained FeCoPBA-C composite was subsequently hold at 900 °C for 2 h under the argon atmosphere to produce FeCo alloy nano particles in-situ produced on the carbon matrix. Finally, the typical hot-melting-diffusion method was adopted to make sulfur diffuse on the surface of FeCo-C, in which sulfur is physically and chemically confined by FeCo-C. As the control experiment, S/C was prepared without deposition of FeCo alloys. The morphology and microstructures of the wheat flour-derived porous C, CoFePBA-C and FeCo-C were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in the Fig. 2 (a), the wheat flour-derived porous C exhibits honeycomb-like structure with lots of 3D pore spaces, which is not only beneficial to the infiltration of electrolyte and rapid ion diffusion, but also accommodate the large volume change during cycling [42]. Fig. 2(b) shows the low-magnification SEM image of CoFePBA-C, where porous C maintains structure integrity with CoFePBA nano particles uniformly distributing in the pores of it, suggesting the successful preparation of CoFePBA-C. From high-magnification SEM image in Fig. 2(c), it can be clearly seen that 30‒50 nm CoFePBA nano-cubes are tightly deposited on the carbon skeleton. Remarkably, CoFe alloy nano-particles in-situ grown on the carbon without aggregation after high temperature treatment, which are covered by a thin and transparent layer, as depicted in Fig. 2(d). TEM images of FeCo-C are further exhibited in Fig. 2(e‒g). It can be observed that FeCo alloy nanoparticles distributes on the surface of C and the average size of FeCo alloy nanoparticles is below 50 nm (Figs. 2e and S1). High-magnification TEM images are shown in Fig. 2(f), from which it can be observed that these nanoparticles are actually wrapped by carbon shells, which is consistent with the SEM results (Fig. 2d). The carbon shells around the FeCo nanoparticles could improve the stability of catalysts and prevent the particles from aggregating. Fig. 2(g) further shows that the carbon shells are actually comprised with a few wavy sub-layers with a spacing of 3.40 Å, indicating the formation of graphite interlayers [43,44]. It can be concluded that FeCo acts as the catalyst to grow carbon shell, as widely reported in the previous literature [35,45]. The FeCo core is indicated by lattice fringes with a spacing of 2.12 Å which are observed on the dark-contrast nanoparticles, corresponding to the (110) planes of FeCo alloy [44]. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) was adopted to track the distribution of different elements in FeCo-C. Element mapping images are shown in the Fig. 2(h), Fe and Co distribute in the same areas, indicating that Fe and Co exist in the same compound. After S diffused onto FeCo-C, little difference can be distinguished between FeCo-C and S/FeCo-C in regard of morphology (Fig. S2a). No aggregation can be observed, indicating the uniform distribution of S. Further, EDS of S/FeCo-C was also performed, which clearly demonstrates the homogeneous distribution of S (Fig. S2b‒f). The crystalline structures of C, FeCo-C and S/FeCo-C composites were measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As displayed in Fig. 3 (a), the XRD pattern of the C shows typical characteristics of amorphous carbon. A weak peak around 2θ = 26.5° is observed, which corresponds to the (002) plane of graphite. FeCo-C composite exhibits three typical sharp peaks at 2θ of 44.8°, 65.3° and 82.7°, corresponding to the (110), (200) and (211) planes of a body-centered cubic (bcc) FeCo alloy (JCPDS#049–1568), respectively [43,46]. It should be noted that the peak of graphite at around 26.5° is enhanced. The XRD results confirm the formation of crystalline FeCo alloy nanoparticles by pyrolysis of FeCoPBA precursor, and graphite carbon shells were also formed in the process, which is consistent with the TEM results. Raman spectroscopy was further used to characterize the graphitization of C and FeCo-C. Two characteristic peaks are observed in both samples at around 1350 and 1580 cm−1 (Fig. 3b), attributed to the D and G band of carbon materials, respectively. Generally, the D band is associated with defects of graphite lattice, while the G band is derived from highly ordered graphite. The intensity ratio of D band to G band (I D/I G) is decreased from 0.98 for C to 0.96 for FeCo-C, implying that part of the amorphous carbon in the FeCo-C is convert into graphite. In addition, the full width at half maximum of G band, another parameter to evaluate the graphite degree for carbon materials, of FeCo-C is less than that of C. These results of Raman measurement are in agreement with above studies of TEM and XRD. The N2 adsorption/desorption measurements at 77 K were carried out to analyze the specific surface area and porous structure of C (Fig. 3c, d). The BET surface area is 1214.9 m2 g−1, while the pore volume is 0.618 cm3 g−1. Combined with SEM images, carbon matrix with hierarchical structure intertwining together, constructs a high-efficient conductive network to provide rapid electron transfer. As shown in Fig. 3(c), the isotherm increased rapidly at a lower relative pressure, and then the adsorption reaches saturation as the relative pressure rose. This is a typical type I Langmuir isotherms, indicating the presence of abundant micropores in C. Firstly, the gas fills into micropores accompanied with the rapid growth of absorbance, then the micropores are nearly full and almost no further adsorption occurs. Apart from that, a slight hysteresis is observed in the desorption curve, revealing the existence of mesopores. The pore size distribution plot (Fig. 3d) shows that the peaks mainly distribute in the range of micropores below 2 nm, and several smaller peaks are also observed ranging from 2 to 10 nm, which confirms the hierarchical porous microstructure of C. The corresponding content of sulfur in the sample was measured by thermalgravimetry analyzer (TGA), as displayed in Fig. S3. The sulfur mass loading of S/C and S/FeCo-C composites are 58% and 62.8%, respectively. There are two phases of weight loss: the main weight loss can ascribe to the evaporation of sulfur located on the surface or those large pores; the second stage is related to the release of sulfur from micropores, which requires higher temperature to overcome capillary force. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) was further introduced to investigate the elemental valence states and surface features of FeCo-C. As revealed by the full scan spectrum of FeCo-C, elements of C, O, N, Fe, and Co can be clearly observed with their content of 91.59 at%, 5.06 at%, 1.32 at%, 1.19 at%, and 0.84 at%, respectively (Fig. S4a). No other signals can be detected. For the high-resolution spectrum of C 1 s (Fig. S4b), there are three peaks at 284.8, 285.6 and 286.8 eV, which can be assigned to C−C, C−N and C=O, respectively [6,45]. The N 1s XPS spectrum can be deconvoluted into three peaks, pyridinic N (398.3 eV), metal N (399.6 eV) and graphitic N (401.1 eV), respectively (Fig. S4c) [35,45]. Note that high content of graphitic N is considered as the potential ORR active sites to promote the catalytic process in N-doped carbon. The Co 2p spectrum exhibits six peaks (Fig. 3e), where the peaks located at 779.1 and 793.9 eV are deemed as zero-valence state Co atom in FeCo alloy, while the other four peaks centered at 781.6 and 796.4 eV (ionic state) with shakeup satellites (785.2 and 802.7 eV) are derived from FeCo alloy and Co-N species [35,47]. Similarly, Fe 2p spectrum can be deconvoluted into six peaks (Fig. 3f), the peaks with the binding energy of 707.4 and 720.1 eV are attributed to zero-valence state Co atom, while ionic state peaks centered at 710.9 and 724.8 eV with shakeup satellites peaks at 714.4 and 732.5 eV are corresponding to FeCo alloy and Fe-N species [45,48,49]. To evaluate the effect of FeCo alloy on the electrochemical performance of LSBs, adsorption test was firstly employed to demonstrated the interaction between LiPSs and FeCo alloy. In detail, C and FeCo-C was added separately into the equal volume Li2S6 solution (Li2S6 dissolved in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) solvent), respectively. After 12 h resting, the solution containing FeCo-C became nearly colorless, while a slight yellow can still be seen in the Li2S6 solution containing the C, indicating strong LiPSs adsorption of FeCo alloy (Fig. 4 a). It has been demonstrated that the dipole-dipole electrostatic interaction between LiPSs and N doping or O functional groups of the carbon hosts can offer adsorption of LiPSs [6,22,50]. More importantly, the polar FeCo alloy contributes to firmly chemical confinement of LiPSs based on the Lewis acid theory. As shown in Fig. S5, The peak of S-metals chemical bond indicates the formation of strong chemical bonding between S (species) and FeCo alloy nanoparticles [26]. The presence of strong chemical bonding between sulfur and FeCo alloy can trap the sulfur molecules and prevent the dissolution of polysulfides during cycling. To confirm the catalytic effect of FeCo alloy on the redox reaction kinetics of polysulfides, the catalytic properties were investigated by CV in symmetrical cells using FeCo-C and C as electrode, from which symmetrical cells were assembled with same working and counter electrodes in a 0.5 M Li2S6 electrolyte. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests for the symmetrical cells in a voltage window of −1.5 to 1.5 V at 5 mV s−1 are shown in Fig. 4(b). The CV experiment of a Li2S6-free electrolyte was also conducted as a blank control, which demonstrates that the Li2S6-free cell shows little contribution of capacitive current. Significantly, the symmetrical cell with the FeCo-C electrode displays much larger redox current compared to the C symmetrical cell, implying enhanced kinetics of Li2S6 conversion on the FeCo-C electrode. Furthermore, it can be clearly observed that there are four distinct and somewhat sharp reduction/oxidation peaks of the FeCo-C symmetrical cell redox curve located at 0.108 V (peak a), −0.466 V (peak b), −0.108 V (peak c) and 0.494 V (peak d). Peak b can be assigned to the reduction of Li2S6 to Li2S (or Li2S2) on the working electrode in the cathodic scan and oxidation of Li2S6 on the counter electrode [23,51,52]. The reconstitution of Li2S6 by the oxidation of Li2S (or Li2S2) on the working electrode and the reduction of sulfur on the counter electrode in the anodic scan resulting in the peak a [23,51,52]. Analogously, the shape of peak c and peak d are identical to the peak a and peak b. Peak c and peak d can be attributed to the oxidation of Li2S6 to generate sulfur and the reduction of S to Li2S6 on the working electrode, coupled with the reduction of Li2S6 to Li2S (or Li2S2) and the oxidation of Li2S (or Li2S2) to Li2S6 on the counter electrode [23,51,52]. It should be noted that the CV curve of C symmetrical cell shows only two peaks with weak current response, suggesting low electrochemical reversibility and conversion kinetics of C electrode. Apart from that, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also employed to explore the catalytic effect. As shown in Fig. S6, the charge transfer resistance on the FeCo-C surface is lower than that on the C surface, showing accelerated charge transfer of FeCo-C. Obviously, the enhanced conversion kinetics in FeCo-C can be certainly ascribed to the high catalytic activity of FeCo alloy. As implied by the XPS results, the total content of Fe and Co is about 2 at%, which should be responsible for the improved electrochemical performance. Further, the chemical bonding between FeCo and C matrix (Fe-N and Co-N) can also promotes rapid electrochemical reactions [22,51]. Owing to the high catalytic activity of FeCo and strong LiPSs adsorption, S/FeCo-C composites were assembled into 2025-type coin cells with a lithium foil as the anode to explore the electrochemical behavior of LSBs. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of S/C and S/FeCo-C in lithium−sulfur batteries at scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 are shown in Fig. 4(c). Two sharp peaks at approximately 2.31 (I) and 2.06 (II) V, representing the transformation from S8 to long-chain polysulfides (Li2S n , 4 ≤ n ≤ 8) and the further reduction of long-chain polysulfides to short-chain polysulfides (Li2S and Li2S2), respectively, are observed on the S/FeCo-C-loaded composite electrode during the cathodic scan. However, the two cathodic peaks shifted to 2.25 (I) and 2.02 (II) V in the case of the S/C-loaded composite electrode, indicating that the polarization is improved and the conversion of soluble LiPSs to final insoluble products (Li2S or Li2S2) is promoted on S/FeCo-C composite electrode. Moreover, similar to the cathodic scan, the anodic peak of S/FeCo-C composite electrode at 2.30 (III) V which attributed to the process of Li2S → S8, is also narrower and shifts to a lower potential (compared to the 2.35 V of S/C composite electrode), further implying the rapid polysulfides conversion on the S/FeCo-C composite electrode. Thus, the CV results clearly indicate that the entire polysulfides redox conversion process is accelerated in the LSBs with the S/FeCo-C composite electrode. Moreover, the Tafel plots of the two electrodes are derived from their CVs by considering the ohmic drop potential (Fig. 4d). During the reduction and oxidation reaction of LiPSs, the S/FeCo-C electrode exhibited a smaller Tafel slope and lower overpotential compared to the bare S/C electrode. Besides, our work achieved much faster kinetics compared with some recent works on catalysts for LSBs (Table S1). Fig. 4(e) shows the galvanostatic discharge-charge curves of S/C and S/FeCo-C cathodes at a constant current rate of 0.2 C (1 C = 1675 mAh g−1) within 1.8‒2.8 V in their first cycle. The S/FeCo-C cathode exhibits a much higher initial discharge specific capacity of 1251.9 mAh g−1 in comparison to the S/C cathode (897.8 mAh g−1) at 0.2 C (Fig. S7). Two typical discharge plateaus and a charge plateaus can be observed in both batteries, which are consistent with the results of CV measurement. The voltage gap (ΔE) between the discharge and charge plateau is related to the electrode polarization. It is clearly displayed that the S/FeCo-C cathode shows smaller potential polarization (ΔE = 160 mV) compared with S/C cathode (ΔE = 190 mV), which proves again the redox reaction kinetics of soluble LiPSs are improved in the S/FeCo-C cathode owning to the catalytic effect during the discharge and charge processes. It's worth noting that small potential gap achieved by FeCo alloy is superior to most of reported values (Fig. 4f) [22–24,53–58]. After 100 stable cycles, 790 mAh g−1 can be retained in S/FeCo-C, which is much higher than that of S/C. EIS measurements for the S/C and S/FeCo-C cathodes of LSBs before and after 100 discharge/charge cycles were also conducted to gain insight the conversion process of LSBs. Fig. S8 shows the Nyquist plots, all the curves contain a semicircular arc in the medium-high frequency range and an oblique line in the low frequency region. The diameter of the semicircle at high frequency region attributed to the charge transfer resistance (R ct), while the oblique line of the low frequency region relates to the ion diffusion. The R ct value of the S/FeCo-C cathode is smaller than that of S/C cathode whether before cycling and after cycling, suggesting that the catalytic effect of FeCo alloy reduces the internal resistance by effectively enhancing the reaction kinetics on the S/FeCo-C electrode. Further, the rate capacity of S/C and S/FeCo-C cathode electrodes at various rates (0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 C) were also evaluated as displayed in Fig. S9(a). The S/FeCo-C cathode has high stabilized discharge capacities of 1250.8, 966.6, 911.8 and 814.1 mAh g−1 at current densities of 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 C, respectively. It shows a great specific discharge capacity of 792.2 mAh g −1 even at a large current density of 3 C. When the current density reserves back to 0.2 C, the specific capacity restores to 951.2 mAh g−1, indicating excellent rate performance. While for the S/C, the capacity is much lower than that of S/FeCo-C. To determine the capacity contribution during high-rate discharge process, the electrochemical behavior of the S/FeCo-C and S/C composite electrode was analyzed. Fig. S9(b, c) shows the discharge/charge curves of the S/C and S/FeCo-C cathodes at various rates. It displays that the S/FeCo-C cathode still keeps typical discharge/charge plateaus even at a high rate of 3 C during the high-rate cycling, suggesting the low polarization in this cell. The capacity of both high and low plateau was also calculated according to the discharge/charge curves, as depicted in Fig. 4(g). The S/C demonstrates more low plateau capacity loss, which indicates that the transformation of LiPSs to insoluble Li2S2/Li2S is kinetically unfeasible (Fig. 4h). Correspondingly, the capacity ratio of low plateau/high plateau of S/C sharply reduces from 2.14 (0.2 C) to 1.33 (3 C), much faster than that of S/FeCo-C (from 2.22 at 0.2 C to 1.60 at 3 C). The above results again confirm that the presence of FeCo alloy serving as catalyst can significantly accelerate the redox reaction of LiPSs. The excellent cycling performance of the cell based on S/FeCo-C cathode at a large current density of 2 C is shown in Fig. 4(i). The initial specific discharge capacity of the cell is as high as 791.9 mAh g−1. After 500 cycles, it still maintains a discharge capacity of 502.5 mAh g−1 at 2 C with nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency. Moreover, the capacity decay per cycle at 2 C over 500 cycles is only 0.073%. Such excellent electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the FeCo alloy that acts as a catalyst to improve the sluggish kinetics of the redox reaction, and consequently limits the shuttling LiPSs, which shows great prospects for energy-storage devices (Fig. S10). Apparently, the S/FeCo-C cathode is competitive in rate capability and cycle stability (Table S2). In order to understand the actual active phases in FeCo catalyst, TEM was performed for the S/FeCo-C composite after cycle tests at the current density of 0.2 C. As shown in Fig. S11(a), FeCo alloy nanoparticles still uniformly distribute in the sample without agglomeration being observed. High-resolution TEM image (Fig. S11c) confirms the (110) plane of FeCo alloy, which implies that there is no phase change during cycle tests. HAADF-STEM was adopted to track the distribution of different elements in S/FeCo-C composite after cycle tests. As displayed in Fig. S11(d‒f), the distribution of Fe and Co are highly overlapping, further indicating that Fe and Co present in the same compound. Based on the above results, it can be concluded that FeCo alloy nanoparticles are very stable during cycle process and the catalytic activity is mainly from the FeCo. It is worth noting that our results are different from Huang's work, which provides a new and effective approach to design high active catalysts for high-performance LSBs [59]. The above results undoubtedly demonstrate outstanding advantages of FeCo alloy catalysts for advanced LSBs. As schematically illustrated in Fig. 5 (a), the polar FeCo alloy contributes to firmly chemical confinement of LiPSs based on the Lewis acid theory [60]. Additionally, the N doping or O functional groups of the carbon hosts also shows adsorption of sulfur species. More importantly, benefiting from the high catalytic activity of FeCo alloy, high conversion rates can be achieved, which can great reduce the accumulation of soluble LiPSs, largely suppressing the “shuttle effects”. Further, the Fe-N or Co-N bonding also promotes to catalyze the conversion process. Besides, FeCo alloy provides fast electron transfer pathways for good rate capability. As a result, increased sulfur utilization can be realized even at higher sulfur content. As demonstrated in Fig. 5(b), it is obvious that bare C with 70 wt% sulfur content possesses low specific capacity and poor cycle stability. Even worse, there is little capacity when the sulfur content is increased up to 80 wt%, indicating ultra-low activity of sulfur. Such detrimental result with high sulfur content remains a challenge for the application of LSBs, which is closely related with the sluggish LIPSs conversion processes. Impressively, the S/FeCo-C (sulfur content of 80 wt%) still shows small ΔE of 180 mV with the initial discharge capacity of more than 1000 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C. Moreover, it can still exhibit more than 720 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles with the Coulombic efficiency of nearly 100% (Fig. 5c). Additionally, to meet the demand of practical lithium-sulfur batteries, we reduced E/S ratio to 5 μL mg−1 to systematically evaluate the catalysis effect [61]. As depicted in Fig. S12, S/FeCo-C cell delivered a capacity of 668 mAh g−1 in the first cycle, which is much higher than that of S/C cell (only 196.4 mAh g−1). More importantly, lean-electrolyte cells with S/FeCo-C cathode still maintain typical discharge curve. However, the lower discharge plateau of S/C is absent, indicating huge nucleation barrier of Li2S2/Li2S and sluggish kinetics under lean-electrolyte. Obviously, FeCo can promote the conversion process from LiPSs to Li2S2/Li2S and increase the specific capacity. Our results demonstrate the catalyst is still effective in practical systems. To get an understand the catalysis mechanism, Fe-C was prepared to investigate its effects on electrochemical performance, as depicted in Fig. S13. The electrochemical performance of S/Fe-C based cells is superior to that of S/C, but inferior to S/FeCo-C, indicating the 3d electronic structure has a significant influence on the catalytic process. It is suggested that catalytic activity can be readily controlled by the elemental composition and arrangement of metal alloys. This not only confirms high performance catalysts of transition metal alloy, but also guide a direction of modifying catalytic activity by element doping. More experimental work and theoretical calculations should be conduct in the future to gain full clarification of the complex reactions. 4 Conclusions In summary, FeCo alloy decorated porous carbon was prepared as a promising host material in the cathode for advanced LSBs. It was confirmed that the FeCo alloy promotes redox kinetics of polysulfide conversion besides its strong adsorption effects of LiPSs, which not only can confine the migration of LiPSs, but also greatly decrease the accumulation of LiPSs. When used in the LSBs, the as resulted S/FeCo-C cathode materials demonstrated high sulfur utilization, good cycle stability and superior rate capability. This work provides a low cost and effective approach to design high active catalysts for high-performance LSBs, which facilitate to overcoming the technical challenges of LSBs and giving new insights into the mechanism of the catalytic processes and polysulfide conversion reactions.

        "dc:description": "Lithium sulfur batteries (LSBs) draw extensive interest because of the ultra-high capacity and low material cost. However, the sluggish lithium polysulfides (LIPSs) conversion processes are detrimental to cycle stability and rate capability, inhibiting the commercial application of LSBs. Here we present the well-designed FeCo alloy catalysts anchored on porous carbon (FeCo-C) as sulfur host to improve the electrochemical performance by accelerating the conversion reactions. The FeCo alloy demonstrates high catalytic effect and strong adsorption capability of LIPSs, in which potential polarization can be greatly decreased and “shuttle effects” can be largely avoided. As a result, the obtained S/FeCo-C composites show an initial specific capacity of 791.9 mAh g−1 at a large current density of 2 C and maintain 502.5 mAh g−1 even after 500 cycles. Moreover, 720 mAh g−1 (corresponding to 70% retention) can be achieved after 100 cycles at 0.2 C with a high sulfur content of 80 wt%, enabling high sulfur utilization. This work not only provides a new insight to investigate the conversion kinetics of LiPSs, but also opens up a new avenue for advanced lithium sulfur batteries.",
