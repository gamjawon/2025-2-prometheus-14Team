It was found that the iron pillared clays (FePILCs) were the most efficient catalysts producing quantitative conversions with greatly reduced amounts of catalysts in lesser reaction times. Their efficiency is attributed to the higher Fe3contents in the catalysts and the pillaring effect.

Introduction The Friedel-Crafts reactions are of great interest due to their importance and common use in synthetic and industrial chemistry. Among the Lewis acids, anhydrous aluminium chloride was the most widely employed reagent to trigger the Friedel-Crafts reaction in the liquid phase in laboratory as well as in industry [1]. The major disadvantages encountered in the use of anhydrous aluminium chloride include corrosion, unfriendliness to environment, heavy expense due to requirement of large excesses of reagent and waste by-products induced by isomerisation in the reaction. In view of these reasons, there was a long-felt need and demand to substitute these reagents by less corrosive and environment friendly materials in the Friedel-Crafts reactions.

Choudary et al.// Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 257-264 search in this direction revealed the materials in the form of solid acids developed from natural clay, zeolites [2], sulfated zirconia [3], etc. Solid acids derived from montmorillonite, a class of smectite clay naturally available, by the process of exchange with different metal ions [4-6] and impregnation with the salts of the metals were explored as catalysts in the alkylation of aromatic hydrocarbons. These studies found that zinc chloride impregnated on K10 montmorillonite, called 'Clayzic' is the most effective material that catalysed alkylation of aromatic hydrocarbons successfully [7] and subsequently the process was commercialised. The report of Cseri et al., who studied the metal ion-exchanged montmorillonites [6] in the alkylation of aromatic hydrocarbons, indicated that the catalysts containing reducible cations (Fe3 Sn4+, Cu2+) exhibited high activities in spite of their low number of Lewis acid sites when benzyl chloride was the alkylating agent. We report in this article the results of the Friedel-Crafts alkylations of aromatic hydrocarbons catalysed by various metal supported montmorillonite catalysts including both metal hydroxy-oxy oligomers intercalated in the inter- layers of montmorillonite, simply known as pillared clay catalysts, and analo- gous metal ion-exchanged montmorillonites. The same hydrocarbon, subjected for alkylation is used as solvent in these reactions. A detailed study correlating the iron contents and activities of the supported montmorillonites in alkylation of toluene with benzyl chloride is presented. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation of catalysts K10 montmorillonite purchased from Fluka Chemicals and Kunipia clay obtained from Japan were used as such. The Fe3+-exchanged K10 montmoril- lonite was prepared as reported earlier by Laszlo and Mathy [5]. The Fe3+-ex- changed Kunipia clay was prepared in a similar fashion. Iron pillared clays sourced from K10 montmorillonite (K10FePILC) and Kunipia (Kunipia FePILC) were prepared in accordance with an earlier procedure reported by Rightor et al. [8]. Aluminium pillared clay (A1PILC), titanium pillared clay (TiPILC), zirco- nium pillared clay (ZrPILC), cerium pillared clay (CePILC) and Ce-exchanged montmorillonite were prepared according to earlier reports in the literature [9-13]. 2.2. Methods of characterisation The Fe3+ content analysis of the catalysts was carried out as reported by Vogel [14]. The activity-time correlation of the catalyst and the conversions of methyl diphenyl methane were followed by analyzing samples of the reaction mixture collected at regular intervals by gas chromatography (GC).

All the other reaction conditions remaining the same as those mentioned above, the alkylation reactions of toluene with benzyl chloride were carried out at different stirrer speeds. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Benzylation of benzene The benzylation of benzene was carried out with a series of exchanged and pillared clays. The data in Table 1 show that the reaction is faster and the 260 B.M.

Since the redox potential of Fe2+~ Fe3is low, the activities which are a measure of the conversions are higher for iron ion containing catalysts. The FePILC is found to be the most efficient of the various catalysts tested for the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene. Another notable point is that the monoalkylated product was obtained predominantly with little or no dialkylated product being formed during these reactions. 3.2. Alkylation of toluene with benzyl chloride The alkylation of toluene with benzyl chloride was carried out with different K10 montmorillonites and Kunipia clay catalysts.

[6]. The conversions and ortho/para (o/p) selectivities are shown in Table 3. It is evident from Table 3 that only ortho and para isomers are obtained when toluene is alkylated with benzyl chloride. No polyalkylated products were obtained. With the change in catalysts only slight variations in the o/p selectivities are observed although there is a remarkable difference in the activities. The conversion is almost quantitative both in the case of Fe3+-ex- changed montmorillonite originating from Kunipia and FePILCs originating from KI0 montmorillonite and Kunipia clay. But, it may be noted here, that the latter reactions exhibit a four-fold and six-fold activity, respectively. 3.2.1. Effect of Fe3 + content and pillaring The activities were studied keeping the catalyst amounts constant, while the iron content differed with catalyst as can be seen in Table 3. In the comparative experiments conducted with Kunipia (entry 4) and K10 montmorillonites (entry 1) as such, the rate of alkylation reaction is sluggish, although a significant amount of iron is present. It is deduced that most of the iron ion present in these clays is not in the ion-exchanged position. A good correlation is observed between the Fe3 + content of the clay and the rate of reaction for the alkylation of toluene. These studies show that the Fe-exchanged and pillared clays sourced from Kunipia are more active than their analogues sourced from K10 montmoril- lonite. Although the results indicate that the activity increases with increase in Fe3+ content in the catalyst, the effect of pillaring process on the activity cannot be ruled out. In order to investigate the relation between the iron content or pillaring process vs. activity, the reactions were designed and conducted maintaining the iron content constant by weighing different amounts of catalysts. Conversions as a function of reaction times are illustrated in Fig. 1. The rate of alkylation reaction is in the order of Kunipia clay < K10 mont. < Fe3+-exchanged K10 mont. < Fe3+-exchanged Kunipia < FePILC K10 < Kunipia FePILC. As is evi- dent from Fig. 1, in spite of taking same amounts of Fe3+ content, the rate of 262 B.M.

KIO Montmorillinite o Kunipio cloy reactions was slow in the case of exchanged clays. This indicates that the increased activities were not only due to the Fe3+ content, but also due to another factor, the pillaring effect, with the hydroxy oligomers of the pillared clay playing a vital role, In the alkylation reaction of toluene with benzyl chloride carried out with varying stirrer speeds. The rate of activity was found to be almost identical irrespective of the stirrer speed. This rules out the possibility of diffusion problem. The above results single out the FePILCs to be better than the other catalysts. 3.3. Benzylation of aromatic hydrocarbons with uncalcined FePILC Little or no change in the ortho/para (o/p) selectivity and conversion was observed even after calcination of the catalyst. Hence, the uncalcined catalyst was used. Quantitative conversions were obtained when the aromatic hydrocar- Table 4 Benzylation of aromatic hydrocarbons with K10 FePILC at 80-85 S. no.

Choudary et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 257-264 263 bons were benzylated in the presence of K10FePILC as the catalyst. The conversions and ortho/para selectivities obtained for these reactions are shown in Table 4. The higher selectivity towards para-isomer exhibited by sec-butyl benzene is due to the higher steric effects. 3.4. Mechanism The influence of the iron content of the clay on its activity, which is correlated to it's easy reducibility, strongly suggests the possibility of a redox mechanism. The existence of the radicals was substantiated by ESR studies carried out by Cativiela et al. [15]. However, there is a large consensus on the fact that Friedel-Crafts reactions proceed through carbocations [1]. It is also well-known that radicals, which could be intermediates in redox processes, are powerful reductants, which should be readily oxidized to carbocations in the presence of reducible metallic ions such as Fe3 In consonance with the above statement, the high activity observed with the reducible cations could be ascribed to a different initiation of the reaction, for instance homolytic rupture of the carbon-chlorine bond followed by the oxidation of the radical: Ph-CH2C1 ~ PhCH~ + CI\" PhCH~ + Fe3+ ~ PhCH2+ + Fe2 Fe2++ CI'~ Fe3++ C1- 4. Conclusions To sum up, though the o/p selectivities are in agreement with those with the earlier reported catalysts, quantitative conversion rates are achieved by using iron pillared clays as catalysts in Friedel-Crafts alkylations. Reaction times and the amounts of catalysts needed for this reaction have been greatly reduced. Moreover, the procedure has the asset of total simplicity: the aromatic hydrocar- bon to be alkylated serves as its own solvent, the work-up consists merely of a filtration to remove the catalyst followed by solvent evaporation. Above all, the reactions are clean with no formation of meta-products. Another advantage of FePILCs is that they can be used in vapor-phase reactions which is not possible with montmorillonite which would collapse and loose its structure at tempera- tures required for the vapor-phase reactions. Vapor-phase reactions using FePILC are under progress. Thus, the Fe3+ content and pillaring effect make FePILC catalysts more active.
