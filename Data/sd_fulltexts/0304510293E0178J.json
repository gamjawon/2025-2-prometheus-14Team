(+1-302)6958347 (Received January 1, 1993; accepted March 1,1993 ) Abstract Highly selective catalysts are demanded by both nature and industry. In nature, catalytic sites which are normally non-selective are made selective by placing them within a relatively inert protein structure. Employing silicon-based zeolite frameworks as direct replacements for this selectivity-directing protein structure, zeolite mimics of natural enzymes can be prepared. In this article, we review some of our work at DuPont on the preparation of hemoglobin, cytochrome P450, and iron-sulfur protein analogues. In addition, the use of this strategy for the rational design of catalysts for reactions of industrial importance, including selective hydrogenations and aminations, is described. Key words: cytochrome P450; haemoglobin; iron-sulphur protein analogues; shape-selective reactions; size-selective reactions; zeolites 1. Introduction The \"effortless\" ease with which nature performs many of the difficult chemical transformations essential to the life process has long been admired by synthetic chemists. By a judicious choice of active sites (acid/base sites of proteins and/or metal-ion complexes) and supports (protein tertiary structure), nature has built an impressive array of enzymes which perform such complex tasks as polypeptide hydrolysis (hydrolases ), isomerization (isomerases), reversible oxygen binding (hemoglobin, myoglobin), selective partial oxidation of unactivated hydrocarbons (cytochromes P450) and electron transport (ferridogins). All of these enzymes have been the subjects of intense efforts designed to model and mimic their activity - with varying degrees of *Corresponding author.

These efforts are driven by a desire to both understand and exploit the chemistry exhibited by these enzymes. It has become increasingly clear that many enzyme systems can be viewed as a simple catalytically active site which can perform straightforward, non-selective chemistry of the desired type which then has its reactivity and selectivity modified by steric effects imposed by the protein surrounding the active site. This article is a brief review of some of our work at DuPont which was developed according to this idea and which has employed silicon-based zeolite frameworks as direct replacements for the protein portion of natural enzymes. The extrapolation of this strategy to the design of other catalysts for non-biomimetic reactions of industrial importance is also described. 2. The design strategy If zeolites are so remarkable why do they get used in such \"boring\" chemistry? It is true that the widespread use of their ion-exchange properties in the water softening/detergent industry and their strong acid catalysis properties in petroleum refining have made zeolites the workhorse materials in both applications. While this has attracted many researchers to the zeolite field, it has also had the effect of typecasting these remarkable materials into a limited number of chemical roles. This viewpoint needs re-evaluation. Consider the following proposal: Zeolites have a number of striking structural similarities to the protein portion of natural enzymes. By taking advantage of these similarities we can develop some exciting new catalysts which combine the attractive features of the robust, chemically-inert zeolite with the tremendous selectivity and activity of enzymes. What is an enzyme? Let us hypothesize that the actual chemical transformation performed by a generic enzyme, if carried out at the naked active site, would be a very non-selective catalytic reaction typical of traditional homogeneous catalysis. However, nature demands high selectivity in her chemical transformations and so has constructed a very special environment in which to carry out this chemistry - the protein tertiary structure. The protein wraps around the active site performing several crucial functions. (a) Protection of the active site from bad reactions such as self-destruction via bimolecular pathways. (b) Sieving of substrate molecules so that only those capable of passing through the protein channels can access the embedded active site. This gives the enzyme a high substrate selectivity. (c) Provides a very stereochemically demanding void space in the vicinity of the active site where the substrate must reside during reaction which leads to transformations at specific bonds within the substrate molecule. DA Corbin and N. Herron / J. Mol. Catad. 86 (1994) 343-369 345 It is clear that each of these functions relates to size and shape selectivity and can, therefore, be simulated using zeolite molecular sieves. Zeolites possess a variety of properties which make them attractive candidates as catalysts and/or supports for size and shape selective reactions. These include numerous, diverse, crystalline structures, molecular sieving ability, ionexchange capacity, and large, accessible surface area. Theoretically, the surface area of zeolites is on the order of 1200 m2/g. To put this into perspective, zeolites are materials where \"a single cupful has enough surface area to cover 20 football fields\" [ 1 ] . With this kind of phenomenal surface area, almost every atom of the zeolite can act as a surface site. Furthermore, zeolites have ion-exchangeable cation sites within the pore structure itself such that accessibility to the pore structure can be fine-tuned by the size and nature of the included cations. Deposition of an active catalytic site within the zeolite pore structure means that the molecular dimensions and configurations of the reactants and products will determine the reaction selectivity. At least four types of reaction selectivity [2] over zeolite catalysts have been described. (a) Product selectivity: molecular sieving selectivity of the zeolite provides the basis for determining the product spectrum - molecules smaller than the pore openings can exit from the framework into the product stream while larger molecules are retained within the framework. (b) Transition state selectivity: certain reactions are prevented because the corresponding transition state requires more space than is available within the framework of the zeolites. (c) Reactant selectivity: only those components of the feed stream that are small enough to enter the pores can react while larger ones are excluded. (d) Reptation selectivity: the reactants that are too large to enter the zeolite pores react on the external surface to form smaller molecules which can then access the internal pores of the zeolite and react there. We now describe applications of these strategies in a number of systems. First, we show how one can use the guidelines provided by nature's catalysts (enzymes) to produce zeolite mimics of biological systems. We then extrapolate the ideas gained in this kind of study to walk through the rational design of zeolite-based catalysts for a number of size and shape-selective reactions. 3. Zeolite mimics of natural enzymes 3.1. Hemoglobin analogue Binding and transport of molecular oxygen are the first steps in the respiratory chain and these functions are performed in mammals by the iron proteins hemoglobin and myoglobin. Many synthetic models [3] and mimics [4] of this chemistry have been prepared using coordination complexes of iron, cobalt, manganese and other metal ions. All suffer, however, from the same 346 D.R. Corbin and N. Herron / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 343-369 problem as the natural systems - autosidation of the active sites with concurrent loss of oxygen binding behavior. Many of the autosidation mechanisms identify ogo or peroso dimer formation as the deleterious reaction [5]. In addition to severely retarding this dimerization, the protein portion of hemoglobin also engenders a fascinating property known as cooperativity [ 6 ] . Hemoglobin is a 4 subunit enzyme where each subunit has an iron oxygen binding site and these 4 sites interact such that binding of oxygen to the first subunit facilitates the binding of oxygen to the remaining 3 subunits of the tetramer. Our synthetic mimic [7 ] consists of the well-known oxygen binder cobalt salen (I) [8] constructed inside zeolite Y. This material is an example of the B i Field (Gauss) 2.00 3100 3200 3300 3400 3500 Fig. 1. Representation of Co-salen inside zeolite Y supercage.

Hill plot of oxygen binding to Co-salen-py in Olite Y. 347 1000 \"ship-in-a-bottle\" [9 ] synthetic approach to encapsulated catalyst complexes in zeolites. Ion-exchange of cobalt (II) ions into the crystallite voids at a concentration of ,. 1Co per 2 supercages followed by sublimation of the flexible free ligand salen into the same voids leads to assembly of the rigid complex. This complex involves square planar coordination of the tetradentate salen ligand such that the complex has dimensions greater than the window size of the zeolite - once constructed inside the pores the complex is physically trapped on the basis of its size: a true ship-in-a-bottle (Fig. 1). This complex, as its pyridine adduct, does indeed form an oxygen adduct as judged by the characteristic ESR (electron spin resonance) signal (Fig. 1) generated upon exposure to dioxygen. Two remarkable features of this zeolite entrapped adduct are: First, compared to the same complex in free solution the zeolite encapsulated material displays quite remarkable stability towards autoxidation. For example the half-life for the oxygen adduct ESR signal at room temperature in air is -_ 4 weeks when entrapped in the zeolite compared to just a few minutes in free solution [ 10 j . The oxygen adducts, incarcerated in solitary confinement within their own tiny cages, simply cannot get close enough to one another for the (oxo and peroxo ) dimerization reactions to occur. Second, the thermodynamics of oxygen binding as plotted in a Hill plot (Fig. 2 ) at 4 different temperatures show evidence of a negative cooperativity 348 D.R. Corbin and N. Herron / J. Mol. Catat 86 (1994) 343-369 between cobalt binding sites (slope < 1) [ 11 ] . Binding of oxygen to the first few cobalt sites makes it progressively more difficult for subsequent oxygen to bind to other sites. This is the reverse of hemoglobin's behavior. The explanation for this behavior is uncertain but it may result from progressively more difficult oxygen binding as one penetrates from the exterior to the interior of each zeolite crystallite. Binding of oxygen at the cobalt sites in the outermost cages of the crystallite is easiest but binding becomes more difficult as the oxygen has to diffuse toward the interior sites. A van't Hoff plot reveals an enthalpy of binding of -11.4 kcal/mol and an entropy of - 51 e.u. which compare with values of -12.4 kcal/mol and -47 e.u. for the same complex in pyridine solution [ 12 ] . The lower oxygen binding constants inside the zeolite appear to result from a reduced exothermicity. This is consistent with the oxygen being bound at a constricted site where the sterics of interaction of bound oxygen with the zeolite cavity walls are important. This example demonstrates the ability of zeolites to reproduce the control (typical of enzyme proteins) of both the interactions between active sites and the thermodynamics of reactions at those active sites. The next example goes on to demonstrate a zeolite's ability to kinetically control product selectivity in an oxidation reaction typical of the monoxygenase enzymes. 3.2. Cytochrome P450 analogue Further down the respiratory chain from hemoglobin lie the monoxygenase enzymes, cytochromes P450, which perform the function of selectively oxidizing organic materials to usable or excretable hydrophilic compounds. Their unique ability to convert, for example, unactivated alkanes to alcohols with unusual selectivities using only molecular oxygen and a reducing cofactor (while in aqueous solution and at room temperature) have made these materials the envy of synthetic organic chemists. There have been numerous attempts to model the heme iron active site of the enzymes [ 13 ] so as to reproduce its selectivity - especially by including bulky substituents upon the basic porphyrin nucleus. While these models have undoubtedly contributed tremendously to an understanding of the mechanistic features of the monoxygenases, they have yet to demonstrate the phenomenal selectivities. Our mimic [ 14 ] again starts with an abstraction of the natural system. The enzyme cycle is represented in Fig. 3, emphasizing only the redox and coordination at the iron center. If one accepts the tenet that the Fe03+ species is the active potent oxidant then the selectivity of the enzyme is dictated by how the protein sieves and directs substrates toward this indiscriminate oxidant. How does nature produce this oxidant? She takes molecular oxygen, two electrons and two protons and eliminates water. Our mimic is designed to do the same thing except that we will take the two electrons and two protons together as molecular hydrogen and combine it with oxygen over Pd (0) to generate hydrogen peroxide. This hydrogen peroxide can then be reacted at an iron site to eliminate water and give the desired Fe03+ unit. If all of this is D.R. Corbin and N. Herron / J. MU Catal. 86 (1994) 343-369 ROH Fe(III) e- RH Fe03+ H20 Fs02+ 'ee~ 2H+ Fig. 3. Enzyme cycle of cytochrome P450. 02 Fe022+ 349 done inside the atereochemically-demanding pores of a zeolite, then any substrate which is simultaneously in those pores should suffer selective oxidation by the Fe03+. The mimic is prepared by sequential ion-exchanges with Fe ( II ) and Pd ( II ) tetrammine cations followed by calcinations and reduction of the Pd ( II ) to Pd ( 0 ) as previously described [ 14 ] . A material with ~ 2 wt % Fe ( II ) and 1 wt. Pd (0 ) is used by immersing the dry zeolite solid in neat substrate alkane and then pressuring the reaction vessel with a 3:1 mixture of oxygen:hydrogen. As a control to assess the intrinsic selectivity of such a Pd/Fe system in the absence of steric effects of the zeolite, catalysts prepared with amorphous alumino-silicate supports were run for comparison. In these cases all reactions must take place at the particle surface since there is no crystalline, internal pore-structure available. While the selectivity (Fig. 4a) for the preferential oxidation of n-octane in the presence of cyclohexane is slight (1.2:1) using the control alumino-silicate support, the selectivity over the Fe/Pd on zeolite A is tremendous ( > 200:1) . This confirms that the zeolite is exerting its sieving effect and that the desired chemistry is occurring inside the zeolite pores. Indeed, not only is the chemistry occurring there but the vast majority of the octanol products are remaining there at the end of the reaction and can only be released for analysis by complete destruction of the framework using conc. sulfuric acid! This trapping of products is more than simple absorption since they are not released by displacement with a more polar molecule (e.g., water). The production of secondary alcohols as part of the product mix means that the pores of the zeolite rapidly become filled with molecules which are too large to escape from the interior and remain trapped. These molecules then act as plugs for escape of even the linear alcohol products so that the entire zeolite interior becomes saturated with products and the catalytic activity is shut down.

Selectivity of allcane oxidation with Fe/Pd/A zeolite and H2/Oa. (a) Substrate selectivity between n-octane and cyclohegane and (b) regioselectivity of n-octane oxidation lems can easily be overcome by using a slightly larger pore-size zeolite ZSM-5 where now all products are released to solution and the acid dissolution step is obviated. In this case, the reaction becomes truly catalytic (although slow). The substrate selectivity of this system pales in comparison to the incredible regioselectivity manifest in the octane oxidation products! In Fig. 4b the dramatic increase of oxidation products derived from terminal methyl group oxidation in the zeolite system is apparent. Over the control catalyst, the methyl/methylene oxidation ratio is 0.05 while in the zeolite A this ratio is 0.6. This selectivity for oxidation toward the end of the alkane chain arises from the very close fit between the alkane and the A pore size which constrains it to have an extended \"linear\" conformation. It is, therefore, the methyl end-groups which are the first to encounter, and so be oxidized by, the iron active sites located in the six-ring faces of the zeolite cage (illustrated schematically in Fig. 5 ). These completely inorganic Si-based zeolite materials compare favorably D.R. Corbin and N. Herron / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 343-369 351 Fig. 5. Cutaway representation of n-octane proceeding through the 8-ring window of Olite A towards the iron active site for oxidation. Cross hatched atom is the active oxygen on iron. with natural systems and far outstrip any other models of selective alkane oxidation yet available in the literature. 3.3. Iron-sulfur protein analogue One of the essential cofactor enzymes in the cytochrome P450 network provides electrons to reduce iron and/or oxygen to generate the active oxidant. These natural electron-transfer materials are typified by the iron-sulfur proteins [ 15 ] . Work by Holm and others has modeled the basic iron-sulfur cores of these proteins and a variety of structure types have been identified. One of these types, an iron-sulfur cubane-like cluster consists of interpenetrating tetrahedra of iron and sulfide ions. Our fascination with using zeolites as very small reaction chambers for production of novel species has led us to explore the possibility of synthesizing extremely small particles of semiconductor materials within the pores [ 16 ] . Such small pieces of a bulk semiconductor lattice cannot fully develop the normal semiconductor band structure and so reside in the so called size-quantized or quantum-confined regime. This is where the electron-hole pair of an excited semiconductor particle has a preferred radius [ 17 ] larger than the actual particle size. The electron then behaves as a \"particle in a bog\" and novel optical properties result. We decided to look at preparation of CdS inside zeo- 352 D.R. Corbin and N. Herron / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 343-369 lite cavities and then to explore the photo-oxidation chemistry of absorbed olefins using these species. Cadmium ion-exchange of zeolite Y is followed by treatment of the dry calcined zeolite with hydrogen sulfide gas (1 atm). At 100 C, this generates CdS clusters inside the zeolite pores. Quantum confinement effects are manifest in that the material is typically white or pale cream rather than the yelloworange of bulk CdS [ 17 ] . The actual structure of the CdS units in the zeolite is revealed by a detailed study of the powder X-ray diffractograms and EXAFS (extended X-ray absorption fine structure) data. The basic CdS unit is a cubane Cd4S4 cluster of interpenetrating Cd and S tetrahedra - (Fig. 6) very reminiscent of the FeA cluster core discussed above. These clusters are located in the small sodalite cages of the framework and are strongly interacting with it through Cd-O bonds (Fig. 6). What is particularly interesting is how these clusters begin to interact with one another as the loading density begins to rise. Above 5 wt.% of CdS, the absorption spectra begin to show a new absorption band and luminescence behavior starts to switch on. The CdS clusters begin to form a three-dimensionally interconnected array (cluster-cluster distance of ~ 6 A) and a semiconductor-like band structure develops (Fig. 6) . Fig. 6. CdS clusters in the sodalite cages of zeolite Y. The zeolite has been reduced to sticks connecting only the tetrahedral atoms for clarity. Inset shows the structure of an individual CdS cubane-like cluster. Cd atoms are cross hatched. D.R. Corbin and N. Herron / J. MU CataL 86 (1994) 343-369 353 This represents a novel state of matter for the semiconductor involving a modulation of its structure dictated by the zeolite topology. This form of CdS lies in the \"twilight zone\" between a molecule and a true extended solid. Since all of the CdS clusters reside in the smaller cages of the zeolite Y framework, the larger cages of the structure are still available for absorption of substrate molecules - in this case olefins for photo-oxidation via electrontranafer. Colloidal CdS in free solution has been used for such oxidations previously [ 18 ] and in a competitive oxidation of styrene and 1,1-diphenylethylene we find that unconfined bulk CdS will effect oxidation in a ratio of 1:2 for these two olefins (irradiation at 365 nm). In the zeolite confined system we find, however, that the ratio becomes 1:1 i.e. a slight shift in selectivity toward the smaller substrate as may be expected on the basis of zeolite sieving effects. From the viewpoint of the enzyme mimic, we have here a system which mimics the core structure of iron-sulfur proteins while also mimicking the electrontransfer (photo-stimulated) abilities of these same proteins. The above examples have demonstrated that viable enzyme mimics of hemoglobin, cytochrome P450 and iron-sulfur proteins can indeed be produced by making use of the analogy between protein tertiary structure and the pore structure of inorganic \"Si-based\" zeolite systems. These examples represent only the tip of a potentially enormous mountain of novel, robust and highly practical enzyme mimics. It only requires that organic chemists view zeolites as aterically demanding supports for active sites and that zeolite chemists view zeolites as something other than acid catalysts or ion-exchangers. We now move on to describe how the notions developed above in mimicking nature's catalysts can be extended to the design of catalysts for other catalytic reactions of importance. This is broken down according to the various types of zeolite imposed selectivity as outlined in the design strategy above. 4. Reactant selectivity 4.1. Olefin hydrogenation using rhodium containing zeolites [191 Huang and Schwartz [20] reported that treatment of Linde 13X zeolite with tris (7c-allyl) rhodium results in a catalyst with improved selectivity towards hydrogenation of small olefins. In our own work on the competitive hydrogenation of cyclopentene and 3- or 4-methylcyclohegene we observed selectivity increases over that measured for Schwartz's catalyst of an order of magnitude, from 4 to 47. All of the zeolites chosen for this study had pore dimensions large enough so that at least one of the reactant olefins would be able to gain access to the intracrystalline voids. This was confirmed by sorption measurements with cyclopentane (with molecular dimensions of 3.5 X 5.4 A ) and cycloheaane (5.0 X 5.8 A) (these being chosen as inert models of the reactant olefins). These sorption measurements, performed on the dehydrated zeolites, also indicated the intrinsic size selectivity of the zeolite framework itself 354 D.R. Corbin and N. Herron / J. Mod. Catal. 86 (1994) 343-369 (Table 1B) . The selectivities of the various catalysts for hydrogenation of the two olefins are listed in Table 1C. In almost all instances, the observed hydrogenation selectivities are superior to those observed with Schwartz's zeolite catalyst'\"\"`. It is also clear, however, that there is no direct correlation between the selectivity predicted by sorption measurements and the observed reaction selectivity. For example, sorption data predict that Rh-ZSM-5 should be the most selective catalyst rather than Rh-ZSM-11. Clearly, factors other than simple pore size differences control the observed selectivities. One such factor, metal ion siting, was suspected and in Table 1D, E, and F is a comparison of the bulk Rh/Si ratio (atomic absorption) to that of the surface layers (XPS). Metal sites on the external surface of the zeolite are expected to be relatively non-size-selective and, because of their accessibility, might be expected to dominate the product distribution. These external sites can be selectively poisoned, however, using the same approach adopted by Schwartz [ 20a ] , i.e., treating the zeolites with the bulky PBu3. Such a ligand treatment leads to a dramatic increase in selectivity e.g., a factor of 4 for Rh-ZSM-11. Treatment with a small phosphine (PMe3) kills all activity. All of the catalysts listed in Table 1 were therefore treated with PBu3 to maximize selectivity, however, those results still indicate that a further major factor contributes to reaction selectivity. One such factor may well be the presence of a variable water content (Table 1G). Typically, all of the zeolite catalysts were partially hydrated at the beginning of each hydrogenation run, and the effect of this water was investigated for the RhX and Rh-ZSM-11 zeolites. The RhX catalyst was run in three hydration states (2%, ;-- 5%, 32% water by weight) and gave selectivities of 1, 6, and 30, respectively. This dramatic effect can be rationalized as follows: in the absence of water, one observes the intrinsic size selectivity of the zeolite framework which in the case of X zeolite would be expected to be negligible (Table 1B) . As the moisture content rises, it will tend to line the internal cations, pores and chambers of the zeolite with a coating of water and thereby effectively reduce the internal pore dimensions. This will, in turn, increase the size selectivity of this zeolite toward the two olefins. Apart from this effect on selectivity, the presence of water also dramatically affects the rate of hydrogenation; it is some 20 times slower for the 32% water content catalyst compared to that with 2%. The Rh-ZSM-11 catalyst was also run with various degrees of hydration and in this case a maximum is apparent in the selectivity versus degree of hydration curve (Fig. 7) . The selectivity at low water content is z 1, in agreement with sorption data (1B ), and at full hydration is only ,:e 7. However, at intermediate levels the selectivity peaks at At~ 47. It appears that at this level of \"This selectivity should be compared with the value of ,zz 25 as inferred from the hydrogenation rates of the individual olefins [20a]. This large discrepancy is apparently the result of performing a truly competitive reaction as opposed to inferring selectivity from individual rate data.

These observations suggest, therefore, that the dichotomy between columns B and C of Table 1 is best explained in terms of the effect of the residual water content of the catalysts (Table 1G) in modifying the framework size selectivity [ 21 ] . This latter observation indicates that a delicate balance exists between selectivities based on pore size and on moisture content. This situation probably occurs in many catalytic systems employing a zeolite (particularly when water is a by-product of the catalytic reaction) and the marked contribution of moisture content toward catalytic selectivity can provide an additional selectivity control in the design of catalyst and should not be overlooked. Looking again toward nature's catalysts for guidance we see that the active site of such catalysts is often water-lined and such water is essential to the selective chemistry being performed - just as is observed here. 4.2. Selective hydrogenation of acetylene in butadiene/ethylene [22J In the production of ethylene from the steam cracking of natural gas, small amounts of acetylene and butadiene are co-produced [ 23 ] . Although the acetylene ( .zt~ 3500 ppm ) and butadiene ( ;:t: 6500 ppm ) are present in low concentrations, the huge annual volume makes recovery of these valuable by-products very desirable. Acetylene, however, can pose a significant hazard in a down- '\"'An alternative interpretation for this observed effect of water content might consider the water to be modifying the active rhodium sites by coordination. While this type of effect may contribute to altered selectivities, we feel that the appearance of a maximum in, and the general shape of, the selectivity curve (Fig. 7 ) is better explained if the proposed mechanism of pore-size modification is the major contributor to selectivity. D.R. Corbin and N. Herron / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 343-369 357 stream cryogenic separation process and must generally be removed by hydrogenation to ethylene over a nickel or palladium catalyst before (\"front-end\") or after (\"tail-end\") fractionation [ 23 ] . Since acetylene and butadiene are adsorbed much more strongly on these catalysts than is ethylene, high selectivity towards hydrogenation of acetylene and butadiene with minimum loss of ethylene can be achieved. Our strategy for designing an improved \"front-end\" catalyst which selectively hydrogenates acetylene, while leaving butadiene and ethylene untouched, was to take advantage of the differences in size and shape of the acetylene, butadiene, and ethylene molecules to establish a kinetic control over the hydrogenation. In other words, impart a reactant selectivity upon the system by choosing the smallest pore zeolite that will allow one or both of the reactants of interest to access the intracrystalline voids. Diffusional limitations should then result in improved selectivities compared to non-microporous supports. If such a selective hydrogenation could be achieved then butadiene could be recovered and this valuable intermediate used for other purposes. Table 2 compares the sizes of the molecules to the pore openings of various zeolites. Clearly, the difference in the sizes of the acetylene ( .. 3.3 A), ethylene ( ~ 3.9 A), and butadiene (,t~ 4.2 A) molecules indicates potential for reactant selectivity. In this case, the 8-ring zeolites are obviously preferred. Our studies, therefore, focussed on partially nickel exchanged zeolite A because of its availability, cost, and its wide use as an ion-exchange substrate. The zeolite A structure, represented in Fig. 8, is constructed of 4-, 6- and 8-membered rings built of silica and alumina tetrahedra. It has a cubic arrangement of truncated octahedral units (sodalite or ss-cages) of free diameter 6.6 A joined through oxygen bridges at the 4-rings enclosing a cavity (a-cage) with a free diameter of 11.4 A. Zeolite A is synthesized in the sodium form. Other forms are prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods and many of their structures have been determined [ 24 ] . Two of the commonly observed cation sites are labelled in Fig. 8. Structural studies have shown that divalent ions prefer the 6-ring sites labelled A. The monovalent ions reside primarily in the TABLE 2 Comparison of zeolite pore dimensions to molecular sizes Molecule Approximate size Zeolite (A )' Number of Approximate pore tetrahedra dimensions (A)b CZH2 3.3 sodalite 6 2.8 C^ 3.9 A, ZK-5, Rho 8 4.3 C^ 4.2 ZSM-5, ZSM-11 10 6.3 X, Y, mordenite 12 8.0 'Determined from space-filling models b Ref. 21, p. 65. 358 DA Corbin and N.

By changing the size of the monovalent ion and hence partially blocking the 8-ring pore, the molecular sieving and hence reactant selectivity of the zeolite can be fine-tuned. Changes in the effective size of the 8-ring pore opening of ion-exchanged forms of zeolite A can be monitored by sorption measurements. Results for a series of samples of exchanged zeolite A are given in Table 3. The probe molecules chosen were methanol with a molecular dimension of about 3.7 A , ethanol at about 4.0 A , and n-propanol at about 4.3 A . Reduction in methanol sorption capacity indicates decreased internal pore volume and relates to the exchanged ionic size. The calcium form of zeolite A (Ni,Ca-A) shows very little differentiation for the alcohols and suggests that very little if any reactant selectivity should occur. In this form of the zeolite where the calcium ions site in the 6- 21.9 19.5 17.0 14.6 10.6 19.9 16.3 11.4 8.6 0.19 D.R. Corbin and N. Herron / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 343-369 359 ring pores, the 8-rings are open and n-propanol easily enters the internal pores of the zeolite. Clearly, in as much as it is smaller in size than n-propanol, butadiene can access the internal cavities. In the sodium exchanged form, some pore narrowing has occurred (as evidenced by reduced n-propanol sorption) which could result in diffusional limitations for the butadiene molecule. In the cases of the potassium and rubidium exchanged forms, essentially no n-propanol is absorbed while decreased ethanol sorption shows additional pore constrictions. Cesium exchange also results in further pore narrowing to the point that ethanol is excluded. Although sorption data are useful in assessing differences in molecular sieving from one exchanged form to the next, the data do not give a measure of the surface activity (vide infra). To simulate the operation of a \"front-end\" hydrogenator, we focussed our studies on the partially nickel-exchanged zeolite A. The catalysts were prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods. In \"control\" experiments, hydrogenation using Ni,Na-A, Ni,Ca-A, and Ni,K-A of varying nickel loadings showed no selectivity, i.e., both acetylene and butadiene were totally hydrogenated. By reducing the active metal content, the catalyst activity and hence the degree of hydrogenation was decreased (ethylene and butenes appeared in the product stream); however, neither acetylene nor butadiene appeared in the product stream. As was the case for the Rh/zeolite hydrogenation systems described above, metal sites on the external surface are expected to dominate the product distribution. The dispersion of the active catalyst in the zeolite can therefore play a significant role in determining the hydrogenation selectivity. Since univalent exchanged forms of zeolites exhibit partial hydrolysis in water suspension resulting in high pH [ 21 ] , Ni2+ will hydrolyze causing precipitation of hydroxide species on the external surfaces of the zeolite crystallites [ 25 ] . Although dilute solutions were employed in the ion-exchanges to minimize this hydrolysis, XPS results show the nickel to be concentrated on the external surface in the unused sample. Just as was the case for the Rh catalysts described above, these external catalytic sites can be selectively poisoned by treatment with bulky phosphines [ 19,20 ] . The result of adding tri-n-propylphosphine to the feed stream is illustrated in Fig. 9. Upon addition (injection of 1-5 cm' at essentially time= 0) to the feed stream, the activity of the Ni,Ca-A catalyst decreased sharply from total hydrogenation of both acetylene and butadiene to 73 and 11%, respectively. After 6.25 h, 100% acetylene and 28% butadiene hydrogenation was observed. With additional time on stream this selectivity was lost but could be regained by readdition of the phosphine. These results demonstrate that if poisoning of the external surface could be maintained continuously, excellent selectivity toward the hydrogenation of acetylene relative to butadiene could be achieved (i.e., hydrogenation is mainly occurring within the zeolite framework and is subject to the size constraints imposed by that framework).

The experimental results using a series of exchanged samples of zeolite A are given in Table 4. The results show that at similar exchange levels, as the size of the ion occupying the site in the 8-ring opening increases, selectivity also generally increases. However, the largest ion used, Cs in Ni,Ca-A, showed somewhat decreased selectivity. This may be attributed to the greater degree of pore narrowing with this very large cation and therefore decreased acetylene diffusion to the internal sites. The reaction selectivity then reflects greater surface contributions. The trade-off in reactant selectivity (diffusion to reaction sites within the D.li. Corbin and N. Herron / J. Mol. CataL 86 (1994) 343-369 361 framework) versus diffusion to the reaction sites on the external surface is a typical problem in the design of zeolite catalysts. Instead of adding catalytic poisons to the reactant stream, an attempt was made to deactivate the surface sites by adding lead (II), a well known poison of active metal catalysts. Treatment of Ni-exchanged zeolites with lead-containing compounds larger than the pore opening should provide permanent deactivation of the surface sites. Such treatments, using lead (II) 2-ethylhexanoate were successful and led to selective hydrogenation. At atmospheric pressure with no thiophene or H2S addition to the feed stream, 29% of the butadiene was hydrogenated at 99.8% acetylene conversion over Ni,K-A/Pb. Increasing the pressure to 220 psia did not alter the selectivity substantially. Upon addition of small amounts of a poison to the feed stream, the selectivity further improved with only 20% of the butadiene hydrogenated at the acetylene breakthrough point. This suggests the there may also be some active sites in surface Ocropores ( > 5 A and not accessible to the large lead-containing poison). After 8 days on stream, both selectivity and activity showed no sign of decreasing. 5. Product selectivity 5.1. Chemical modification of surfaces for improved selectivity to dimethylamine in synthesis from methanol aO ammonia [271 The industrial preparation of methylamines involves the reaction of methanol and ammonia over a solid-acid catalyst. The reaction proceeds towards a thermodynamic equilibrium distribution of the three amines which favors trimethylamine production. At 90% conversion of methanol, the equilibrium product distribution is 17:21:62 (mol%) of monomethylamine (MMA ), dimethylamine (DMA), and trimethylamine (TMA), respectively. While TMA is favored, the greatest market demand is for DMA. Presently, unwanted TMA is re-equilibrated with ammonia to produce MMA and DMA. This technique, though material efficient, is energy intensive. To improve the selectivity to DMA in this reaction, we have designed zeolites as potential catalysts [ 27-34 ] . The methylamines synthesis can be described by the reaction mechanism shown: NH3 + MeOH hi MMA+ H2 0 MMA+MeOH-+DMA+H20 DMA+MeOH>TMA+H20 At the initial stage of the reaction, MMA is the dominant product. As the reaction proceeds, MMA converts to DMA which in turn converts to TMA. 362 D.R. Corbin and N. Herron / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 343-369 Each of these reactions can be described by a rate constant kl, k2, and k3, respectively. If allowed to proceed to completion, this thermodynamically driven reaction will provide the equilibrium product distribution. In this case, the ratio of the rate constants k2/k3 is about 0.33 at 325 C. If, however, the conversion of DMA to TMA can be sterically inhibited, then the product stream will O richer in DMA. To provide a gauge of our ability to inhibit this conversion, we will use the ratio of the rate constants, k2/k3, as a \"selectivity number\", SN. If we compare the sizes of the three major product molecules, MMA (,& 4.1 A), DMA (;t~ 4.4 A), and TMA (,,%; 5.0 A), and the pore openings of various zeolites (see Table 2), the differences in sizes of the products indicates the potential for establishing a kinetic control over the system, i.e., a product selectivity in which the size of the pore opening of the zeolite limits the egress of the large TMA molecule while allowing MMA and DMA to exit from the zeolite. As shown in Table 5, in our examination of various pore-size zeolites, we have found small pore zeolites to be preferred and more specifically that some untreated zeolites [ 29 ] , particularly chabazite [ 30 ], H-rho [ 31 ] and H-ZK-5 [32], are especially effective at producing high dimethylamine selectivities. Because of its unique combination of stability, selectivity, and activity for this reaction, we focussed our studies on H-rho. H-rho as prepared by literature procedures yields crystallites on the order of 0.3 to 0.8 .Cm in size. Typically, impurity phases such as chabazite, pollucite, and zeolite P are also formed [31,35,36]. If the synthesis conditions are wellcontrolled, the presence of these impurity phases can be limited to approximately 5-10%. The small rho crystallites have an external surface area of approximately 5 to 15 m2/g based upon their particle size. For a typical prepa- TABLE 5 Comparison of selectivity and activity Zeolite type Pore opening' Selectivity number' Activity number` Si02/A1203 - 0.31 0.2 H-Y 12 0.45 0.2 H-mordenite 12 0.7 1.7 H-clinoptilolite 10 0.53 0.01 H-ferrierite 10 0.55 0.02 H-erionite 8 0.8 0.2 H-chabazite 8 2.8 0.3 H-rho 8 4.2 3.3 H-ZK-5 8 4.4 0.6 'Number of TOz groups forming largest ring.

DA Corbin and N. Herron / J. MU Catal. 86 (1994) 343-369 363 ration of H-rho, the total external surface area, a combination of the accessible surfaces of the impurity and rho phases, can amount to a significant value, 20 to 70 M2 1g, as measured by mercury porosimetry or adsorption [ 30b ] . As we observed in the hydrogenation systems earlier, sites on this external accessible surface are expected to be relatively nonselective. The differing amounts of external surface area and impurity phases caused the various rho samples to have a range of selectivities towards the synthesis of DMA versus TMA. Unlike our studies of various sources of chabazite as a methylamines catalyst which showed sorption measurements to provide a rational basis for the catalytic selectivities [30b], no such basis could be established for the various zeolite rho preparations using alcohols as probe molecules. We therefore elected to use their SN, k2/k3, as a characterization method. At room temperature, TMA can neither adsorb nor desorb from the RHO framework, but, at temperatures greater than 200 C, it can readily migrate into and out of the framework. Since the methylamines synthesis reaction is performed at 300-325 C over zeolite rho, we expect the TMA formed within the RHO framework to be able to enter the product stream. Our efforts to further improve DMA selectivities of rho preparations have involved numerous treatments [31,33,34] not only to minimize the contribution of the external accessible surfaces but also to narrow the pore openings to prevent TMA from leaving the framework and entering the product stream. These efforts included liquid phase treatments -in which alkoxides were hydrolyzed to give oxide coatings on the zeolite crystallites [33,34]. But the most effective treatment involved the vapor phase reaction of species with the active surface sites. Some loss in activity is expected by surface treatments as the external surface contributions to the product stream are reduced. However, the contribution to the product distribution by the external surface is expected to be thermodynamically controlled and non-selective and, therefore, the product stream should be richer in TMA. Our earlier work showed that untreated Hrho is surprisingly selective to DMA versus TMA [29,31 ]. However, the selectivity and activity observed are very dependent upon the nature and amount of impurity phases present as well as the degree of exchange, calcination temperature, and the atmosphere of calcination [ 31 ] . The effect of different vapor phase treatments on the selectivity and activity of a \"sub-standard\" (SN =1.9 ) H-rho preparation is shown in Table 6A. The data for a typical non-zeolitic catalyst are provided as a basis of comparison. Indeed, upon application of a surface treatment to a \"sub-standard\" H-rho, modest losses in activity are observed coupled with very significant improvements in selectivity. Clearly, trimethylphosphite (TMP) treatment is most effective at improving selectivity. Depending upon the specific preparations of rho, the treatments are so effective that essentially no TMA is observed in the product stream (see Table 6B ). Assuming that the external surface of a sample produces TMA with an equilibrium distribution, the contribution of this surface to the product distri- 364 TABLE 6A Treatments applied to H-rho D.R.

Using the data supplied in Table 6C, the external surface contribution can be represented by the ratio of the observed TMA percentage for the untreated catalyst over the equilibrium TMA percentage (62% ). Thus, the external surface (before treatment) of a sample provides about 48% (30/62) of the products. For the rho sample discussed above, the TMP treatment virtually eliminates the appearance of TMA in the product stream. However, the ability of the phosphite treatment to inhibit TMA production may result not only from the deactivation of surface sites, but also from a slight reduction in the channel or pore opening to the surface which may be sufficient to inhibit TMA egress from the framework. To determine the reasons for the improved selectivity, characterization studies involving infrared, MASNMR, sorption, XPS and chemical analysis were performed. Infrared studies were carried out on samples of H-rho before and after treatment. Relative changes in surface acidity were determined by measuring chemisorbed pyridine at 150 C. Since pyridine is too large to enter the channels of zeolite rho, it chemisorbs at the external (accessible) sites. Separate infrared peaks are observed for the pyridine sorbed on Lewis (approx. 1450 cm-1) and Bronsted (approx. 1545 cm-1) acid sites. All vapor phase treatments decrease the surface acidity and therefore, reduce the contribution by the surface to the acid-catalyzed methylamines synthesis reaction. Treatment with TMP and PC13 very significantly reduce Lewis acidity in addition to almost eliminating Bronsted acidity. The other treatments, though effective poisons of the Bronated acidity, are less reactive with the Lewis acid sites. A band at 3740 cm-1, assigned to terminal Si-OH, also significantly decreases in intensity on treatment with hexamethyldisilazane, HMDS.

Changes in intensities of internal framework (3640, 3610 cm-1) [31a] hydroxyls on treatment are minimal which suggests that the terminal Si-OH groups are located primarily on the external surface because they are accessible to the vapor phase treatment by the named compounds. The data indicate that the phosphorus-containing reagents are most effective in decreasing surface acidity. IR and NMR studies [39] of the reaction of TMP with acid zeolites suggest that TMP rearranges [40 ] to give dimethylmethylphosphonate (DMMP ) which then reacts irreversibly with the zeolite hydroxyl groups upon heating. This reaction is accompanied by a loss of methogy groups. Similar behavior has been reported by Weinberg and co-workers for the reaction of DMMP adsorbed onto A1203 [ 41 ] . XPS measurements were obtained to determine the relative surface composition and nature of the surface species of the TMP treated samples. The binding energy (EB =134.0 0.2 eV) of the Pep photoelectron peak for all samples indicates pentavalent phosphorus bonded to oxygen. The atomic ratio values from chemical analysis and XPS are given in Table 7 for a series of TMP treated H-rho samples that were heated after the vapor phase treatment. The surface/bulk ratio for phosphorus analysis is greater than 1 for all samples, indicating surface enrichment of this element. Sorption data, given in Table 8, obtained before and after treatment of the rho samples, indicate that virtually no change in capacity has occurred; therefore, the framework has not been affected by treatment. (This is supported by the fact that essentially no change in the X-ray powder diffraction patterns before and after treatment was observed.) Measurements of relative sorption rates comparison of n-propanol uptake at 20 h and 136 h) are very sensitive to D.R. Corbin and N. Herron J. MU Catal. 86 (1994) 343-369 367 small changes in the dimensions of pore openings and these also did not change significantly upon treatment. Therefore, the sorption measurements indicate that only the external surface (and not the framework) of the rho zeolite is modified by these vapor phase treatments. (Later work using TMA itself as a probe molecule showed that the TMP surface treatments are bifunetional in nature: TMP eliminates the activity of the external surface sites and inhibits the TMA sorption process [31e] ). By applying this rational design approach, a zeolite catalyst has been selected and then modified to produce a remarkably selective methylamines catalyst. Detailed characterization then allows us to elucidate exactly how the improved selectivities have been achieved and thereby helps build a design database for producing additional zeolite catalysts for future selective, catalytic chemistries. 6. Conclusions Nature and industry are quite alike in that both often demand high selectivities for their chemical transformations. By placing active catalytic sites within a relatively inert protein tertiary structure, nature takes what would be a very non-selective catalyst and makes it very selective. At DuPont, the examples outlined above show how, by using nature as our mentor, we have been able to adopt her strategies and apply them to the rational design of zeolite based catalysts as both mimics of natural enzymes and for processes of industrial interest.

Highly selective catalysts are demanded by both nature and industry. In nature, catalytic sites which are normally non-selective are made selective by placing them within a relatively inert protein structure. Employing silicon-based zeolite frameworks as direct replacements for this selectivity-directing protein structure, zeolite mimics of natural enzymes can be prepared. In this article, we review some of our work at DuPont on the preparation of hemoglobin, cytochrome P450, and iron-sulfur protein analogues. In addition, the use of this strategy for the rational design of catalysts for reactions of industrial importance, including selective hydrogenations and aminations, is described.
