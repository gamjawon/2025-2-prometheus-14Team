H. ELLESTAD* Central Institute for Industrial Research, Blindern, Oslo 3 (Norway) (Received May 30,1984; accepted July 26,1985) Summary The surface of various silica gels with average pore diameters of 4, 6, 10, 20, 50 and 100 nm was dehydrated between 200 and 800 C and reacted with TiCl4. Catalysts for alkene polymerization were prepared by further reaction with Et^AlC^-^ (x = 1, 2, 3). Catalytic activities were studied for different degrees of bonding to the surface and ligand substitution. Higher dehydration temperatures, which gave larger molar chloride-to- titanium ratios, and larger pores increased the specific activities. The highest value of 400 g polyethylene (g Ti)~1 atm~1 h~1 was obtained for SiO^ 100 nm. Squarate and oxalate ligands gave activities equal to that of chloride. For EtaAl, the catalytic species have been explained in terms of in- dividual Ti(III)/Et3Al complexes anchored to the surface by SiO Ti bonds. For Et2AlCl, most of the Ti is initially released from the surface and precip- itated as a Ti(III)/Et2AlCl complex. Introduction The development of second-generation Ziegler and Ziegler-Natta catalysts for polyolefin production has particularly attempted to (a) increase the activity with a sufficiently long catalyst life-time to avoid catalyst removal in the final product, which (b) must have adequate molecular weight, molecular weight distribution and the right proportions of side chains. The goal has been achieved in many ways. One of the most important methods has been to disperse the active titanium centres on the surface of solid compounds and thereby increase the active surface area. In the poly- merization of propylene, certain geometric preferences for the catalytic coordination complex are also necessary to produce the preferred isotactic product. *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed at: Statoil, Forus, P.O. Box 300, 4001 Stavanger, Norway. 0304-6102/85/$3.30 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 290 In the first published patents on second-generation Ziegler catalysts, supports such as SiO;, Al^Os and MgO were employed [1, 2]. Later, numer- ous patents and detailed studies were published. Although SiO^ as support does not give the highest catalytic activities, it has been studied in some detail [3-12]. In this respect the silica gel has been considered as a relative inert material, mainly reacting by surface silanol groups or strained siloxane bonds according to eqns. 1 and 2: MOy(s)(OH)^ + TiL,4 > MOy(s)0 TiL4_^ + xHL (1) M0y(,) ^O+T^-^MOy^^ ^ (2) Strong basic or acidic sites (Bronsted and Lewis types) could then be avoided. To form the active catalyst, the anchored surface species are normally reacted with an alkylaluminium compound. The nature of the catalytic sites has been discussed in terms of (a) in- dividually active Ti Al sites anchored to the support or (b) formation of crystallites of TiL3, preferably TiCIs, dispersed on the surface. The poly- merization mechanism given by Cossee [13], with the basic step as monomer insertion at the transition metal-polymer a-carbon bond, has been widely accepted. Bimetallic centres with the employed base metal also continue to be discussed [14]. We have previously published detailed data for the reactions between TiCl4 and surface silanol groups [15]. TiCIa groups were formed with the corresponding number of (4 x) SiO Ti bonds. This number varied with the silanol density (dehydration) and could also be influenced by thermal treatment of the SiOa/TiCL species or by extraction with donor solvents like tetrahydrofuran (THF) or pyridine [16]. No TiCl4 was observed to coordinate through SiOz donor sites. The influence of ligands on the catalytic activity has been frequently studied [3,6,7]. Particularly for discrete anchored Ti sites, the bonds to the support may make a significant contribution. With particular rele- vance for our study, Ballard [17] observed that for certain types of organic ligands, the activity increased with increasing acidity of the ligand's corre- sponding acid. To study this further, the influence of substitution of Cl by anions of the strong squaric acid (l,2-dione-3,4-dihydroxy-3-cyclo- butene) and oxalic acid was included. The surface species formed are reported to be influenced by the sub- sequent reaction with alkylaluminium chloride cocatalyst, and dissolution as well as rearrangement effects have been observed [4, 5, 9, 16,18,19]. In our study we attempted to elucidate some of these effects further, and have included a detailed study of the influence of the porosity of the sup- port on the catalytic activity. For this reason, a variety of silica gels with different average pore diameters from 4 (600 m2 g~1) to 100 nm (35 m2 g~1) were chosen. 291 Experimental Silica gels (Merck) with average pore diameters of 4 (597 m2 g~1), 6 (513 m2 g-1), 10 (330 m2 g-1), 20 (171 m2 g-1), 50 (72 m2 g-1) and 100 nm (36 m2 g~1) (surface area given in parentheses) were dehydrated in a dry N2 stream for 18 h at 200, 300, 400, 600 and 800 C. The thorough purifica- tion methods for TiCl4, Et^l, EtsAlCl, EtAlCl; and solvents such as heptane, tetrahydrofuran (THF) and pyridine have been described previously [15, 16,18]. The monomers ethylene and propylene (Phillips polym. grade) were purified by passing the gases through a column with dried SiO-^ reacted with Et3Al. Squaric and oxalic acid from Aldrich (min. 96%) and Merck (min. 99.5%), respectively, were dried before use. The experiments were carried out under rigorous conditions, employ- ing Schlenk tube techniques with purified Ar atmosphere. The solid catalyst precursors were prepared by surface reaction of the silica gel with ~ 25 ml solution of 1 M TiCLi in heptane. The liquid was removed before evacuation at 10~3 bar for 24 h. For further details see [ 15]. Substitution of chloride ligands with squaric acid (samples 2 and 5, Table 1) was performed by taking ~ 1 g of the original SiOa/TiCI^ compound and adding 25 ml of a THF solution containing squaric acid in an amount equal to the quantity of anchored Ti. After being stirred for 24 h, the sam- ples were washed on a glass filter three times with 5 ml THF and then evacuated 24 h at 0.1 bar. Sample 7 (Table 1) was prepared by adding a 0.5 M solution of oxalic acid in THF to the SiOz/TiCI^ catalyst. Equal proportions of anchored Ti and oxalic acid were used. After being stirred for 2 h, the solid sample was washed three times with 10 ml THF and then TABLEl Ethylene polymerization activities for SiO^/TiCLc systems treated with THF and squaric or oxalic acid\" Sample SiOa/dehydration Ligand substitution Ti nclln'n S P^ nr. temperature (%).

Samples 3 and 6 (Table 1) were prepared in a manner similar to samples 2 and 5, but the squaric acid was excluded. This means actually that an extraction was made of the first anchored TiCI^ by THF. Sample 8 (Table 1) was made by decomposing the SiOa/TiCI^ sample at 400 C for 3 h under Ar atmosphere. The catalysts were tested in glass apparatus equipped with a thermo- stated water jacket for temperature regulations. Unless otherwise indicated, the experiments were carried out under the following standard conditions. The amount of Ti was kept nearly constant at ~ 0.5 mmol for the Si0>2 4, 6 and 10 nm samples and at 0.15 mmol Ti for SiO^ 20, 50 and 100 nm. The cocatalyst was added in molar Al-to-Ti ratios of 10, with a prereaction for 0.5 h before the polymerization started. The pressure was atmospheric (corrected for partial pressure of solvent in the calculations), temperature 22 C and polymerization time 0.5 h with a magnetic stirring speed of ~ 1300 r.p.m. For high pressure experiments, a corresponding steel equip- ment was used. The monomer consumption was in all cases measured by calibrated capillary flowmeters, and the polymerization reaction was stopped by destroying the catalyst with a solution of 1% HC1 in isopropanol. After drying in vacuum at 70 C, the product was weighed. For polypropylene the heptane index was measured according to the normal procedure. Ti, Al and Cl were analyzed by standard spectrophotometric, atomic absorption and potentiometric titration techniques, respectively [15, 16]. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Beckman IR-9 instrument, and the EPR-spectra measured with a Varian Associates, Mod U 4500-10A apparatus. Sample preparations were carefully carried out in a dry box with Ar atmo- sphere or in situ. Results and discussion Si0>2 with average pore diameters of 4, 6, 10, 20, 50 and 100 nm were dehydrated at 200, 400, 600 or 800 C for 18 h before reaction first with TiCl4 and subsequently with EtaAl, Et2AlCl or EtAlClz. Typical activity curves for the monomer flow as a function of time at standard experimental conditions are shown in Fig. 1 for the three cocatalysts. The produced amounts of polyethylene per g catalyst, with EtaAl as cocatalyst, under standard experimental conditions are presented in Fig. 2, and the corre- sponding activities per g Ti are given in Fig. 3, all as functions of the SiOa dehydration temperature. The activity per g Ti as a function of the Ti density is shown in Fig. 4. The detailed chemical data for the SiO^TiCI^ catalyst precursors have been published previously [15]. The experiments were very sensitive to impurities, and the monomers were purified thoroughly. Identical conditions for the various experiments were obtained by keeping the total amount of Ti in the reaction vessel constant. In this way reproducible data were obtained within 5%. However, under less rigorous purification conditions the activities were sometimes more than doubled, but were difficult to reproduce. 293 Et,AICI Et,AI 10 20 30 40 50 60 TIME (mm) Fig. 1.

SiO-i with an average pore diameter of about 20 nm (172 m2 g~1) dehydrated at about 400 C has the best total activity for a specific catalyst weight of reactor loading. Similar experiments for propylene polymerization gave corresponding results. Generally, the activity was ~ 5 -10% compared to ethylene with 295 the same temperature and pressure influences. Products from an autoclave experiment carried out at 80 C had a heptane index of 17% (last exp. Table 3). Thus, the SiOz/TiC^/EtzAlCl catalyst produced mainly the less com- mercially preferred atactic product. In Figs. 3 and 4 the specific activities, calculated from the data given in Fig. 2 and the chemical analyses of the SiO^/TiCLc systems [15], are pre- sented as functions of calcination temperature and Ti density, respectively. The general pattern is an increase in the specific activity for higher dehydra- tion temperatures and lower Ti densities, respectively. For similar experi- mental conditions, the data in Fig. 3 correspond well with previously published results ([ 12], pore radia < 10 nm). For each of the specific silica gels, the most pronounced relative activ- ity enhancements are observed for dehydration temperatures between 200 and 400 C as well as 600 and 800 C. Between 400 and 600 C the increase is rather moderate. In the lower temperature region the activity enhance- ment is attributed to the very pronounced increase of the molar chloride-to- titanium ratio. This is clearly demonstrated in Fig. 5, which shows the relative activities for the various catalysts, with Et3Al as cocatalyst, as a function of the rici/fi-n ratio. Catalyst precursors with more (Si 0)n Ti bonds were formed either by extracting the originally prepared sample with THF (or pyridine) (Table 1, samples 1, 3, 4 and 6) or by thermal treatment at 400 C (sample 8). The data demonstrate a pronounced reduction in the specific polymerization activity for more SiO Ti bonds to the surface. Possible THF molecules coordinated to the Ti atoms are easily removed by the large excess of added EtaAlCl. In these experiments, the Ti density is reduced by about 30% (samples 1 - 3, samples 4 - 6), which with constant pore characteristics should have given significant activity increase if the reaction was partly Ti density- controlled. For the normal prepared SiOz/TiC^ compounds, the Ti density decreases most significantly for dehydration temperatures between 400 and Fig. 5. Relative polymerization activity variation as a function of the molar chloride-to- titanium ratio for various Si02/TiCl4/Et3Al systems: x-10 nm, ^-20 am, 0-50 nm and a-100 nm. 296 600 C where the specific activities change the least. Thus far, we may conclude that the Ti density is of minor importance, while the n^ln-n ratio has a significant influence on the specific activities. The variations of the nci/\"Ti ratios as well as Ti densities change less from 600 to 800 C than from 400 to 600 C [15]. These two parameters therefore cannot account for the observed activity increase in this region (Fig. 3). For the narrow pore gels (4 -10 nm), this effect may be attributed to sintering of the very narrow pores, as evidenced from the observed reduc- tion of the surface area at 800 C [15]. Ti atoms anchored in the very inner pores, possibly complexed with aluminium alkyls, will block or hamper monomer diffusion and render part of the Ti atoms superfluous, although they are involved in the calculations of the specific activity. For SiO; 20, 50 and 100 nm, the molar chloride-to-titanium ratios show a greater increase between 600 and 800 C relative to the other gels, which may account for some of the effect. In addition, TGA data reveal that a special second-stage dehydration process takes place at about 650 C, which may influence the pore structure somewhat. For all dehydration temperatures, the specific activities increase for higher average pore dimeters. The explanation is that for polymerization- active porous particles, the pores become gradually filled with polymer. As the internal pressure increases due to polymer build-up, the particles disintegrate [7b, 20-22]. This seems to occur at a relatively early stage. The diffusion barrier between catalyst sites and monomer is therefore relatively independent of the amount of polymer formed and not influenced by diffusional hindrance of monomer in rigid narrow pores. Generally larger pores with lower mechanical strength will collapse more easily, and hence catalytic sites therein will be more accessible. The optimum total activity for sample 20 nm/400 \"C/TiCl/EtaAl (Fig. 2) may then be interpreted as a compromise between the number of active Ti sites per surface unit and the accessibility of monomer. Influence of cocatalyst The most active catalyst in Fig. 2, SiO, 20 nm/400 C/TiCl^, was tested with respect to type and concentration of cocatalyst as well as to variations in experimental conditions. From Fig. 1 and flowmeter readings for experi- ments given in Table 2, it was observed that after a pre-reaction of 0.5 h the three Al cocatalysts at an n/^lnyi ratio of 10 gave the same shaped activity curve. The initial activities were somewhat lower the first 5-10 min for EtaAlCl and EtAlCl; than for EtsAl. This varied somewhat with the n^iln^ ratio employed. For Et3Al the same shape of the activity curve was observed without pre-reaction, or if pre-reaction was carried out at 0 C or with an \"Ai/^Ti ^io of 1. For n^ln-y. = 1 and no pre-reaction, Et^AlCl and EtAlCl; gave a gradual activity enhancement the first hour, and then a slow deactiva- tion started. The stable level is approximately the same as with pre-reaction. Thus, we observe the same two principal types of curves which are referred 297 TABLE 2 Polymerization of ethylene by SiO^ 20 nm/400 C/TiCl,c with different cocatalysts, n^l rtfi ratios and prereaction timesa Sample nr.

Results from a more detailed study of the influence of the cocatalyst are given in Table 2. Et2AlCl is the preferred cocatalyst for these systems, while Et3Al exhibits somewhat lower activities which are reduced at higher temperatures. EtAlClz gives the lowest activities, but they increase at higher temperatures (80 C). With pre-reaction, an optimum around 4 for the \"Ai/\"Ti vstio is found for EtaAlCl and EtAlC^. This corresponds well with reported values of 5 for SiG^/TiClx systems [5] and 4 for TiCl3 catalysts [24], but optimum values of 35 have also been reported [8, 10]. The favourable ratio for Et3Al is ~ 10, probably because of larger reactivity to impurities. A particularly high activity is observed for sample 20 with Et2AlCl in a molar Al-to-Ti ratio of 1 and no pre-reaction time. It has been published that adsorption of the monomer is necessary to form the active sites [22b]. When the Ti Al complex is formed first, as in our study, adsorption of monomer is somewhat hindered by the cocatalyst. The formation of active centers is then reported to be slower than if the monomer is added first. The instantaneous introduction of monomer without pre-reaction also has a favourable influence on the later-discussed dissolution/precipitation process, and thereby creates a particularly active catalyst. For Et3Al and \"AI/^TI = 10, a temperature variation from 20 to 50, 60 and 80 C gave an activity reduction both for autoclave and glass appa- 298 TABLE 3 Polymerization activities for SiO^ 20 nm/400 \"C/TiCl^/EtxAlCla-a: Amount Al compi ound Monomer Tern] ->.

A bend in the activity curve at 50 - 60 C was also observed for solid catalysts prepared from TiCl4 and EtgAl [24, 25b]. Our results suggest that Et3Al almost instantaneously generates very active sites, and pre-reaction has no importance. Due to its strong reducing power and reactivity further reduction to Ti(II) and possible reactions with impurities in the system may take place. These reactions are stimulated at higher temperatures. The overall result is a relatively fast decrease of the activity, which to a certain extent can be recovered by adding more EtaAl during the polymerization reaction. At this stage (polymerization for 15 min) further reduction seems to be less important. With larger concentrations of Et^AlCl and EtAlCl; the same tendencies are generally observed, but due to their lower reactivity the effects are smaller. EtaAlCl has the best balance between reducing power and Ti- complexing ability. EtAlCl; has somewhat lower reactivity which is improved considerably at higher temperatures. For both compounds, the temperature stability of the catalytically active complex at 80 C is good enough to take advantage of the faster reaction rates. The main reason for the variations relative to Et3Al seems to be the difference in the nature of the catalytic site (see later discussion). Squaric and oxalic acids To further study the effects of ligands, the anchored chloride was partly substituted by anions of the strong squaric and oxalic acids (pKi and 2 = 0.54 and 3.48, 1.8 and 4.2, respectively). The data from chemical analysis and polymerization experiments are shown in Table 1, samples 2, 5 and 7. Additional evidence for the formation of titanium squarate surface species comes from the typical squarate IR absorption bands at 1790, 1680 and 1550 -1400 cm\"1, as shown in Fig- 6. Chemical analyses indicate a reduc- tion in the na/\"Ti ratio of about 1. This implies that squarate for the large pore sample (20 nm/400 C) has substituted Cl~ ions and formed mono- 299 WAVENUMBER (CM'1) Fig. 6. Infrared spectra of SiOa/TiCU reacted with a solution of squaric acid in pyridine. dentate Ti-squarate ligands. It seems that for SiO; 10 nm/400 C, a larger proportion of narrow pores has prevented a complete monodentate sub- stitution, but such substitution has been obtained for the smaller oxalate ligand (sample 7). Squarate and oxalate anions gave activities rather similar to Cl~, thus verifying the results published by Ballard [17]. As the squarate (and oxalate) ligands are bidentate, it is likely that they interfere with the aluminium compounds as stable Al-squarates have been reported [23] (see later). It is of interest to note that these catalysts have been first treated with THF, so that a large part of the anchored Ti has already been removed. Thus, the later discussion of first dissolution and then precipitation of a solid com- pound by Et2AlCl does not apply for these samples. Attempts to prepare active homogeneous or solid titanium squarate catalysts were not successful. Catalytic sites The EPR spectrum of the SiO; 20 nm/TiCLJEtsAl sample (Fig. 7A) suggests that the active centres are Ti(III) formed on the surface by reduc- tion with the Al cocatalyst. The spectrum has a simple shape, which indi- cates little distortion of the unpaired electron. There are no indications of species with short-range orders similar to the a; JS; 7- or 5-modifications of crystalline TiCIs (Fig. 7C-F). No such long-range order existed, since the samples were X-ray amorphous. Keii [25] assigns similar bands (g= 1.94) for a-Tida to certain solid surface complexes activated by grinding or addi- tion of Aids. Admittance of olefin shifted the g value to 1.93. In a previously published paper [16] it was found that when this sample was reacted with Et3Al in an nAi/\"Ti vatio equal to 3, 32% of the cocatalyst was chemisorbed on the surface (nAisuif/MTi w 1)- Two-thirds of this Al was extracted by a subsequent THF treatment. The remaining one-third was probably complexed with the Ti atoms or had partially reacted with the silica surface. Negligible amounts of Ti were found in the heptane solution. It seems as if EtaAl primarily reduces the anchored Ti(IV) to Ti(III) and Ti(II), and only slowly attacks the SiO Ti bond. By subsequent com- plexation, individual polymerization-active centres of the type SiO Ti- (III^^^AK^* are mainly formed on the surface. 300 1-2.00 1 A -^ g -1.9S1.904 &B-40G Fig. 7.

A SiO 20 nm/TiClx sample treated with a heptane solution ofEtzAlCl (\"AI/\"!! = 10) gave an EPR spectrum similar to the one for Et3Al (Fig. 7B). The band width was somewhat broader (B = 67 gauss) and the g value was shifted slightly to 1.944. A similar band with a g value of 1.951 was observed by Soga et al. [12]. Chemical analyses showed that all the EtzAlCl was chemisorbed on the SiO;.

Table 4. For a n/^/n-n ratio = 1, no X-ray lines were observed. Further EPR studies will be reported elsewhere [27]. Previously, it was reported [16] that for n^/n'n = 1 for both EtzAlCl and EtAlCl;, 28 and 37%, respectively, of the Ti was found in solution after the polymerization had been completed. For ratios of 4 and 10, similar Ti amounts were reported for EtAlCl; but none for Et^AlCl. Subsequent extraction of the solid catalyst by THF dissolved 76% of the Ti, which indicates that double-bonded Ti was also removed from the surface. Thus, it seems established that with chloride-containing cocatalysts, the Ti is to a large extent released from the surface by insertion of the Al compound at the SiO Ti bond, and subsequently (particularly for EtaAlCl) precipitated as a solid species on the surface, preferably at the anchored Al or remaining Ti ions. This may be the reason for the TiCIa crystallites re- portedly formed under certain experimental conditions [5, 9]. However, our X-ray data show no indications of the crystalline a; fS-, 7- or 5-TiCls modi- fications. Nor could the lines be identified as TiCIa, OTiCIa, Aids, TiOz or A1203 which might be formed by certain surface reactions. The crystalline sample consists most probably of individual Ti111^ entities complexed with a large surplus of bridging EtaAlCl molecules. The polymerization activities of the formed Ti(III) species were equal to those formed by substitution of chloride with the squaric or oxalate anions. In these samples a large proportion of Ti had been removed by THF. The remaining Ti atoms were anchored to the surface preferably by double bonds, and probably would not undergo significant further dissolution nor, accordingly, subsequent precipitation. Neither would these ligands fit into a crystalline TiCIa lattice. Therefore, these results support the description of the active sites in terms of individual Ti(III) species. The nonexistence of TiCl3 crystallites is also inferred from the very low isotacticity of the polypropylene product (17%) revealing predominant- ly unsaturated Ti coordination. Also, formation of TiCl3 crystallites in dis- solution-precipitation reactions would be more favourable for higher Ti surface coverage, while the highest specific activities are shown for the samples with the least Ti coverage. 302 For EtAlClz the dissolution effect is the same as that for EtaAlCl, but due to its higher complexing ability, more Ti is kept in solution and less is precipitated. The catalytic sites are believed to resemble those formed by EtzAlGl. In general, it is interesting to observe that although the catalyst pre- cursor TiCl4 is anchored to the silica surface with stable SiO Ti bonds, these can be attacked by the cocatalyst and under certain experimental conditions form the final catalytic centres by a complete rearrangement of the initially established surface species. This phenomenon may vary for different supports and play an interesting part in the preparation of poly- merization catalysts. Regardless of the employed experimental conditions, the polymeriza- tion activities of the supported TiCLc systems are an order of magnitude lower than the corresponding systems prepared directly from TiClx and ethylaluminium chlorides. Thus the advantage of dispersing the active catalyst on a support surface, in one way or another, and thereby exposing more active sites seems to be more than compensated for by the formation of less active surface species and the unfavorable pore structures of the support. Also, the strong mechanical characteristics of silica gels seem partly to hamper sufficient breakdown of the solid structure to prevent diffusional barriers for the monomer by build-up of polymer product in the pores. Furthermore, because of dissolution/precipitation reactions, anchoring on the support does not necessarily give a better understanding of the nature of the active sites.

Ellestad ∗ Central Institute for Industrial Research, Blindern, Oslo 3 Norway * Author to whom correspondence should be addressed at: Statoil, Forus, P.O. Box 300, 4001 Stavanger, Norway. The surface of various silica gels with average pore diameters of 4, 6, 10, 20, 50 and 100 nm was dehydrated between 200 and 800 °C and reacted with TiCl4. Catalysts for alkene polymerization were prepared by further reaction with Et x AlCl3−x (x = 1, 2, 3). Catalytic activities were studied for different degrees of bonding to the surface and ligand substitution. Higher dehydration temperatures, which gave larger molar chloride-totitanium ratios, and larger pores increased the specific activities. The highest value of 400 g polyethylene (g Ti)−1 atm−1 h−1 was obtained for SiO2 100 nm. Squarate and oxalate ligands gave activities equal to that of chloride. For Et3Al, the catalytic species have been explained in terms of individual Ti(III)/Et3Al complexes anchored to the surface by SiO-Ti bonds. For Et2AlCl, most of the Ti is initially released from the surface and precipitated as a Ti(III)/Et2AlCl complex. References 1 Brit. Pat. 823 024 (1957) to Bataafsche Petroleum Mij. 2 Brit.
