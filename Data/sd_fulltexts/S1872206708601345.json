DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(08)60134-5 Catalytic Oxidative Removal of Dimethylsulfoxide by Hexadentate 8-Quinolinolato Manganese(III) Complexes XIE Fang, FU Zaihui * , ZHONG Sheng, YE Zhengpei, ZHOU Xiaoping, LIU Fenglan, LU Chunli, RONG Chunying, MAO Liqiu, YIN Dulin Key Laboratory of Resource Fine-Processing and Advanced Materials of Hunan Province, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology and Traditional Chinese Medicine Research of Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hunan Normal University, Changsha 410081, Hunan, China Abstract: A series of hexadentate 8-quinolinolato manganese(III) complexes (Q 3 Mn III ), with NH 4 OAc and HOAc as additives, were highly efficient catalysts for the oxidation of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) with aqueous hydrogen peroxide in an environmentally friendly ace- tone-water medium. The halogen substituents on the ligand improved the catalytic efficiency of Q 3 Mn III complexes, which was likely due to their strong distortion effect on Q 3 Mn III as indicated by the B3LYP/6-311G+(d) calculation. Various parameters were investigated and a reaction mechanism was proposed. Key words: dimethylsulfoxide; catalytic oxidation; hexadentate 8-quinolinolato manganese(III) complex; hydrogen peroxide Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) has good thermal and chemical stability and is a good solvent for organic and inorganic com- pounds. It is being increasingly used as a solvent in laboratories and industry [1,2]. However, its large scale applications pro- duce large amounts of waste containing DMSO [3]. DMSO is known to be resistant to biodegradation [4]. For this reason, the removal of DMSO from the waste has become an acute prob- lem. The oxidative removal of DMSO is a competitive ap- proach to solve this problem because its oxidative product dimethylsulfone (DMSO 2 ) is an industrially valuable product (e.g., it can be used as a high temperature solvent in extractive distillation, in electroplating baths, in making ink [5]) and a suitable electrolyte for lithium intercalation batteries [6], and DMSO 2 undergoes rapid biological degradation [3,7]. Some effective catalysts have been developed for the oxidation of DMSO to DMSO 2 with aqueous hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), such as W-containing layered double hydroxides [3], TS-1 [8], Fe 2+ [4], goethite ( D-FeOOH) [9], etc. However, it is still highly desirable to develop a more efficient and environmentally friendly catalysis process. Recently, we have found that hexadentate 8-quinolinolato manganese(III) (Q 3 Mn III ) complexes can efficiently catalyze the epoxidation of alkenes [10,11] and oxidation of alcohols [12] with aqueous H 2 O 2 . Based on the recent successful ap- plications of Q 3 Mn III catalysts in the above oxidation reactions, we became interested in the potential of Q 3 Mn III catalysts for sulfide oxidation. Here, we report preliminary results from using Q 3 Mn III complexes to catalyze DMSO oxidation with H 2 O 2 in a water-acetone medium containing ammonium ace- tate (NH 4 OAc) and acetic acid (HOAc). 1 Experimental 1.1 Preparation and characterization of Q 3 Mn III complexes 8-hydroxyquinoline (8-HQ, a), 5-chloro-8-HQ (b), 5,7-di- chloro-8-HQ (c), 5,7-dibromo-8-HQ (d), and 5-chloro-7-iodo- 8-HQ (e) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. The other com- mercially available chemicals were laboratory grade reagents from local suppliers. Q 3 Mn III complexes 1a–1e (Scheme 1) were prepared and characterized following a reported proce- dure [11]. UV-Vis spectra of the Mn complexes were recorded XIE Fang et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(10): 981–985 from 200 to 700 nm on an UV-3310 spectrophotometer (Hi- tachi). 1.2 DMSO oxidation tests The general procedure for DMSO oxidation was as follows. H 2 O 2 (30%, 4 mmol) was added to a cooled (10 o C) and stirred water-acetone (v/v 1:3, 3 ml) mixture of DMSO (4 mmol), catalyst Q 3 Mn III (0.8 μmol), NH 4 OAc (0.2 mmol), and HOAc (0.1 mmol). After H 2 O 2 was consumed completely, shown by an inspection with potassium iodide-starch test paper, the catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture by filtration. The filtrate was analyzed on an Agilent 6890N gas chromato- graph (GC) with a HP-5 quartz capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 m) and flame ionization detector (FID) using ultrapure nitrogen as the carrier gas (rate 1.0 ml/min). Both the injector and detector temperatures were 250 o C, and the column temperature was 130 o C. The isolated sulfone was identified by comparing the MS spectra with those of refer- ence samples. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Characterization of Q 3 Mn III complexes In our previous work, we showed that the Q 3 Mn III com- plexes (1a–1e) had a hexadentate structure with a distorted octahedral geometry using CHN and Mn elemental analyses and diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectroscopy [11,12]. Here, the distortion effect of the Q 3 Mn III complexes was further investigated by the density functional theory (B3LYP) with the 6-311G+(d) basis set. All the calculations were conducted using the Gaussian-03 version C02 package with tight self-consistent field (SCF) convergence and ultrafine integra- tion grids. Figure 1 gives the optimum three-dimensional structures and the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO) for 1a and 1d, in which the three Mn–O bonds of each complex were not equal to each other. The Mn1–O2 bond was the longest among the Mn–O bonds. Moreover, the differences between the Mn–O bonds were more obvious in 1d as compared to 1a (see ' values listed in Fig. 1). This could be due to a stronger distortion effect of 5,7-dibro- minated Q 3 Mn III . Moreover, the difference between the two orbital energy for 1d was lower than that for 1a, indicating that the charge transfer from HOMO to LUMO via Mn 3+ ions in 1d was easier than that in 1a. This leads to the high activity of 1d. These observations indicated that the halogenated Q 3 Mn III complexes had a strengthened distortion effect. 2.2 DMSO oxidation Table 1 gives the reaction results for Q 3 Mn III -catalyzed DMSO oxidation with H 2 O 2 . It is evident that all the Q 3 Mn III complexes, with the help of NH 4 OAc-HOAc, were active for this reaction, with modest to high activity and excellent selec- tivity for the sulfoxide DMSO 2 (>99%) in water-acetone media (entries 1–5). A favorable effect of the halogen substituents of the aryl ring of the ligand on catalytic activity can be seen in 1b–1e. The 5,7-dihalogenated catalysts 1c–1e gave higher conversions (ca. 96%–99% in entries 3–5) than 5-chlorinated 1b (ca. 93% in entry 2). The activity followed the sequence 1a < 1b < 1c < 1d < 1e. This was likely due to the high resistance of halogenated 8-HQ ligands against the oxidative degradation of Q 3 Mn III , as reported for chlorinated porphyrin-Mn III [13], and the gradually enhanced distortion effect from 1a to 1e, as shown by the DFT calculations. Entry 6 shows that a fivefold scaled-up reaction for DMSO showed the same result as the small scale one. This gave 90% isolated yield for DMSO 2 by recrystallization. Entry 7 shows that 1d can be filtered directly and reused five times without loss of activity. This indicates that 1d was stable under the present oxidation conditions. However, in the case of 1a, the same recycle test was not successful, which may be due to the gradual deactivation of 1a caused by an oxidation deterioration of its ligand. Interestingly, entry 8 shows that the use of 1.0 equivalent of peracetic acid, without the help of a catalyst and additive, can directly and efficiently oxidize DMSO to its sul- fone. In the following experiments, the effect of additives was further examined using 1d as the catalyst (entries 9–15 in Table 1). In the absence of additive, the catalytic reaction proceeded very slowly and needed a long reaction time to give a high conversion (entry 9). HOAc (pH = 5.23 here) was not effective for improving catalytic activity (entry 10). NH 4 OAc (pH = 8.09 here) can significantly accelerate the reaction (entry 11). The best result was achieved upon using the NH 4 OAc-HOAc mixture (pH = 7.13 here) as additives (entry 4). In addition, the mediated effect of NaOAc (pH = 8.10 here) was similar to that of NH 4 OAc except for a longer reaction (entry 12). Na 2 HPO 4 (pH = 8.60 here) and NH 3 ·H 2 O (pH = 8.65 here) with a weak basicity also exhibited a positive effect in improving the ac- tivity (entries 13 and 14), whereas NaOH with a strong basicity showed a negative effect on the catalytic reaction (entry 15). These observations indicated that the pH of the additive in the reaction medium played a key role in the catalytic performance of the Q 3 Mn III complexes.

The effect of water amount on TOF of 1d-catalyzed DMSO oxidation. Finally, the effect of the amount of water on the turnover frequency (TOF) was investigated using 1d-catalyzed DMSO oxidation. As shown in Fig. 2, the catalytic reaction proceeded efficiently in a pure acetone medium and gave a modest TOF (ca. 588). Adding a suitable amount of water accelerated the reaction, and the highest TOF (ca. 2425) was achieved at the volume ratio of acetone to water of 3:1. This was likely due to the effect of water on improving the solubility of the additives (NH 4 OAc-HOAc). However, an attempt to increase the ratio of water resulted in a decreased TOF. This may be due to the floating phenomenon of 1d, which occurred easily at such a high ratio of water. 2.3 Reaction mechanisms The Q 3 Mn III -catalyzed DMSO oxidation process was further monitored by UV-Vis spectroscopy. Figure 3(a) shows a step- wise overlay of UV-Vis spectra for the 1d complex in an ace- tone medium at room temperature, where curve (1) is the spectrum of 1d in acetone. The absorption band with max ~412 nm can be assigned to the metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) [14]. When the NH 4 OAc-HOAc aqueous solution and DMSO were added to the (1) solution, the MLCT band de- creased a little (curve (2)). On adding H 2 O 2 to the (2) solution, the MLCT band immediately shifted to max ~426 nm, and its intensity was much decreased (curve (3)), indicating that some Mn III peroxy species X were generated rapidly. Consequently, this band slowly decayed with time (curves (4) and (5)) and then again increased toward curve (2) after a long time (about 24 h, curve (6)). This may indicate that the X species reacted with DMSO to give the oxidative product DMSO 2 and simul- taneously regenerated the catalyst. It is noteworthy that the curve in the 500–600 nm region assigned to the ligand to metal charge transfer in the Q 3 Mn V =O did not increase in the H 2 O 2 treatment process. This indicates that Q 3 Mn V =O was not re- sponsible for the DMSO oxidation. 350 400 450 500 550 600 650 700 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 A b s o r b a n c e ( a .u .)

The above experiments were repeated in the absence of ad- ditives. The UV-Vis spectra are given in Fig. 3(b). In this, curve (7) is the spectrum of 1d in acetone-water solution containing 0.2 mmol DMSO. When adding H 2 O 2 to the (7) solution, a spectral change similar to that mentioned above was seen during the oxidation except that a shift of the MLCT band did not take place (curves (8) to (12)). This suggests that H 2 O 2 may directly activate Q 3 Mn III to give another Mn III peroxy species Y that is different from the X species mentioned above, which can lead to DMSO oxidation. Based on the above observations, we propose that Q 3 Mn III (1 in Scheme 2) easily cleaved the longest Mn–O bond to form a penta-dentate Q 3 Mn III -OAc with a pendant hydroxyl group (2) in the presence of NH 4 OAc-HOAc or NH 4 OAc. Then, 2 rap- idly interacted with H 2 O 2 to form the corresponding Q 3 Mn III -OOAc species (the above X species, 3), which gave the spectral change shown in Fig. 3(a). 3 may eventually revert to 2 through directly transferring its O atom to DMSO due to its strong oxidation ability, which was supported by the experi- ment using peracetic acid as an oxidant in the absence of catalyst and additive (entry 8 in Table 1). On the other hand, 1 XIE Fang et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(10): 981–985 may directly react with H 2 O 2 to form a penta-dentate Q 3 Mn III -OOH species in the absence of additives (the above Y species, 4), which gave the spectral change in Fig. 3(b). Then, 4, as a relatively weak oxidant, may slowly oxidize DMSO to DMSO 2 and regenerate catalyst 1. 3 Conclusions We have developed a highly efficient and environmentally friendly method for DMSO oxidation with H 2 O 2 catalyzed by hexadentate Q 3 Mn III complexes in an acetone-water medium containing NH 4 OAc and HOAc. The high activity of the Q 3 Mn III complexes was due to their special distorted octahedral structures that could be easily converted to the corresponding penta-dentate with pendant hydroxyl groups by opening an axial Mn–O bond in the reaction media. The di-halogenated Q 3 Mn III complexes had a strong distortion effect, which can lead to a further improvement in catalytic activity. With this kind of Q 3 Mn III complexes, we are interested in exploiting the preparation of other 8-quinolinolato metal complexes and their applications in organic oxidation. References 1 Xu X Y.
