Graphical abstract Catalytic oxidation of aromatic sulfur compounds for separation from fuel oils has turned to be an important theme in environmental protection. However, most current reports focused on metal-based catalysts, resulting in high costs and potential secondary pollution to fuel oils. In this work, three metal-free brönsted acid ionic liquids were prepared and anchored onto graphene-like hexagonal boron nitride (G-h-BN) to gain metal-free, heterogeneous catalysts. The heterogenization process not only provided convenience to recycling of the catalysts, but also supplied a sharply decreased ILs dosage. Notably, the prepared catalyst [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN held the best catalytic activity, a ∼100% of catalytic activity can be gained in catalytic oxidation of 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6-DMDBT), which has been regarded as the most stubborn sulfide in industrial hydrodesulfurization (HDS). It was also found that distractors in fuels showed almost no influence on catalytic oxidation of 4,6-DMDBT. Besides, the catalytic oxidation product was also investigated to propose a possible reaction mechanism. The heterogeneous metal-free catalyst were recycled for 5 times without significant decrease in catalytic performance. Keywords Brönsted acidic ionic liquid Heterogenization Hexagonal boron nitride Oxidative desulfurization Introduction Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been regarded as an efficient strategy in removing organic pollutants in water, fuel oils and some other media for environmental remediation [1–3]. The pathway can be operated at near-ambient temperature and pressure, which is an economical method from both the fundamental and a technical points of view [1,2]. Among all AOPs, catalytic oxidation of sulfur compounds in fuel oils is an important one (Oxidative desulfurization, ODS), because of the combustion of sulfides in fuel oils will result in serious air pollution with the emission of SO x but hydrodesulfurization (HDS) process is less active to aromatic sulfur compounds and requires hash operating conditions [4,5]. A core topic in the ODS process is seeking for a proper catalyst with high activity. Up to date, diverse catalysts, such as ionic liquids (ILs) [6–9], organic acids [10], polyoxometalates [11–13], and metal oxides [14–17], etc., have been developed in ODS systems. Among those reported highly-active catalysts, ILs, especially task-specific ILs (TSILs), have gained increasing attentions due to their excellent dissolving capacity to both inorganic and organic compounds, adjustable acidity, high stability, etc. However, most current reported TSILs for ODS are metal-based ones, resulting in secondary pollution to fuel oils and higher costs. To settle this issue, a small amount of reports have been focused on metal-free TSILs, especially acidic TSILs. The reason that acidic TSILs have been developed is because of the Lewis alkalinity of sulfides in fuel oils. Zhao and his co-authors reported utilization of [Hnmp]BF4 as the extractant and catalyst for ODS and a ∼100% catalytic can be gained [18]. Lv presented a [Hnmp]HCOO TSIL for ODS with satisfying catalytic activity [19]. However, giving an insight to previous reports, an inevitable shortage is that the large consumption amount of TSILs (Table 1 ), resulting in a higher costs. The large consumption amount of TSILs mainly originates from the poor exposure and low contact area between TSILs and reactants. Additionally, the homogenous catalyst also struggles from separation difficulty, leading to recycling disadvantages. To settle this problem, heterogenization of TSILs has been considered as an efficient strategy for constructing heterogeneous catalyst. The heterogenization process can hold the both advantages of high catalytic activity of TSILs and recycling convenience of supports. Currently, alumina [20], mesoporous silica [21], metal organic frameworks (MOFs) [22] and carbon nanotubes [23], etc. and some other materials with high specific surface areas have been widely applied in heterogenization of TSILs [24–26]. Although these supports provide convenience in separation, the less exposed active sites drives the heterogeneous catalysts are less than the original homogeneous ones. Accordingly, preparation of a satisfying catalyst with durative high activity and favorable recycling ability is rather important. More recently, layer structural materials have been found to be a potential option because of their high SSAs and special layer-structures, keeping them away from easily-blocked porous structure [27–29]. Among all those layered materials, graphene-like hexagonal boron nitride (G-h-BN), known as “white graphene”, has been regarded as a favorable one. Compared with graphene, G-h-BN holds better thermal-stability and resistance to chemical corrosion. Indeed, G-h-BN has been widely employed as supports for synthesizing heterogeneous catalysts with excellent catalytic activity and promising durability [30–36]. In this work, we presented three metal-free TSILs ([Bmim]H2PO4, [Bmim]HSO4 and [Bmim]HCOO), and were anchored onto G-h-BN with rather high specific surface areas to obtain heterogeneous catalysts. The as-gained metal-free catalysts were carefully characterized by a series of analysis methods. The heterogenization process not only provided recycling performance to the catalysts, but also impelled the catalysts to be a more reactive species than original TSILs. What is noteworthy is that the prepared catalysts showed high catalytic activity to 4,6-DMDBT, which has been long regarded as a stubborn sulfides in HDS. Moreover, the catalytic ability of [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN was hardly affected by distractors, giving a potential practical application. The prepared most active catalyst were recycled for 5 times without significant decrease in catalytic performance. Experimental Materials Boric acid (H3BO3, A.R. grade), urea (CO(NH2)2, A.R. grade), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30wt.%), n-octane (A.R. grade), methanol (A.R. grade), methane acid (HCOOH, 98%), sulphuric acid (H2SO4, 98%), phosphoric acid (H3PO4, 85%), dichloromethane (CH2Cl2, AR grade), tetrachloromethane (CCl4, AR grade), and 1-N-Butyl-3-Methylimidazolium Chloride ([Bmim]Cl) were obtained from Shanghai Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., Tetradecane(99%), dibenzothiophene (DBT, 98%), benzothianaphthene (BT, 99%), 3-methylbenzothianaphthene (3-MBT, 96%), and 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6-DMDBT 97%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich without further purification. Catalysts preparation process Synthesis of G-h-BN Typically, 10mmol of H3BO3 and 300mmol of urea were placed in a 100mL of beaker, and a mixture of DI water and methanol (volume ratio of 1:1) was added subsequently. Afterwards, the breaker was heated to 60°C and kept at this temperature until the total removal of solution to obtain a solid mixture. Then, the mixture was transferred to a tube furnace and heated to 900°C with a ramping rate of 5°C/min; additional two hours heating at this temperature was employed. The heating process was carried out under a N2 atmosphere protection. Finally, the white powder G-h-BN was obtained. Synthesis of Brönsted acid ionic liquids An dichloromethane solution by dissolving 8.7335g of [Bmim]Cl in 75mL of CH2Cl2 followed by adding equimolar phosphoric acid dropwise with magnetic stirring continuously. After stirring for 24h, the solvent and the reaction product (HCl) were removed in a rotary evaporator. The obtained colorless viscous liquid was [Bmim]H2PO4 after drying in a vacuum at 50°C overnight. [Bmim]HSO4 and [Bmim]HCOO were synthesized with the same method by replacing H3PO4 with H2SO4 and HCOOH, respectively. Synthesis of heterogeneous catalysts 0.01g of [Bmim]H2PO4 and 0.19g of G-h-BN were mixed with 20mL of ethanol as solvent. Afterwards, the mixture was kept magnetic stirring vigorously for 24h in an oil bath with a reflux condenser at 85°C. After stirring, the mixtures were dried at 150°C after filtering by a vacuum suction filtration. The obtained white powder was [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN with a [Bmim]H2PO4 loading amount of 5wt.%. [Bmim]HSO4/G-h-BN and [Bmim]HCOO/G-h-BN with loading amountd of 5wt.% were synthesized with the same method, respectively. Characterization A Nicolet Nexus 470 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer with KBr pellets at room temperature was employed for determination of Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra. Ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–vis DRS) were determined using BaSO4 as the reflectance standard material on a Shimadzu UV-2450, which is equipped with spherical diffuse reflectance accessory. An ESCALAB250 (Thermo VG, UK) was used for recording X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a D8 Advance X-ray diffraction using Cu Kα radiation (λ=1.54Å) in the range of 2θ=10–80 o. The Raman spectra was recorded by a Thermo Scientific DXR Smart Raman spectrometer with an excitation light of 532nm. Morphology characterization (Transmission electron microscopy [TEM]) was carried out with a Hitachi H-700 Transmission electron microscope. The final products of oxidative desulfurization process were analyzed by a Gas chromatography−mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Desulfurization of model oil Preparation of model oil For preparation of needed model oils, a certain amount of sulfur compounds was added in n-octane with an S-content of 500ppm. For determination of the S-content on GC, a concentration of 4000ppm of tetradecane was added as internal standard. Oxidative desulfurization process The whole oxidative desulfurization process was carried out in a 40mL home-made two-neck flask in oil bath. Typically, when the oil bath increased to needed temperature, a certain amount of catalyst, 5mL of model oil and required amount of 30wt.% H2O2 were added to the flask with magnetic stirring vigorously. Afterwards, to analyze the S-content in the model oil, the upper layer phase was carefully withdrawn and injected into a gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID). Results and discussion Catalyst characterizations FT-IR spectra of TSILs ([Bmim]H2PO4, [Bmim]HSO4 and [Bmim]HCOO) and supported TSILs ([Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN, [Bmim]HSO4/G-h-BN and [Bmim]HCOO/G-h-BN) are listed in Fig. 1 a and Fig. S1. For the brönsted acid ionic liquids (Fig. S1), the peaks around 2962cm−1, 2873cm−1 and 1465cm−1 were indexed to the stretch vibrations and in-plane flexural vibrations of CH. The peaks at 1571cm−1 were ascribed to the stretching vibration of CN, and the peak around 995cm−1 stands for the stretching vibration modes of CC [11]. For G-h-BN (Fig. 1a), the characteristic peak around 1382cm−1 was the in-plane transverse optional modes of B-N [43]; and the NB stretching vibration mode showed a characteristic peak around 804cm−1 [44]. After immobilizing ILs (Fig. 1a), the characteristic peaks of G-h-BN were still detected, which are similar to the pristine G-h-BN. However, due to the relative low content and excellent dispersion property of TSILs on G-h-BN, no obvious peaks for TSILs could be seen. The FT-IR characterization states that G-h-BN is stable as a support for heterogenization of TSILs and the TSILs are highly dispersed. XRD patterns of G-h-BN and [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN are displayed in Fig. 1b, two peaks in the XRD pattern for hexagonal boron nitride phase at 26.7° and 41.6° were clearly detected, which can be indexed to the (002) and (100) lattice plane of h-BN (JCPDS Card No. 34-0421). In addition, the two main peaks were still detected after heterogenizing the TSILs, proving the stable structure of G-h-BN. No additional peaks for ILs was detected in the XRD pattern, attributing to the high dispersion on ILs on the surface of G-h-BN. Raman spectra of G-h-BN and [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN are presented in Fig. 1c. A sharp peak around 1374cm−1 was clearly seen, which is attributed to the B−N vibrational mode (E2g) within layers of G-h-BN. Compared with bulk phase of h-BN, the corresponding characteristic peak shifted to a higher frequency and presented a larger full width at half maxima (FWHM) value, indicating that the G-h-BN is a few-layer structure, which leads to the rather high specific surface areas of the prepared samples [45,46]. Moreover, compared with the G-h-BN, no additional peak for ILs was detected, which is in consistent with FT-IR and XRD characterizations. As we all know, the peaks of Raman spectra originates from molecular vibration. Due to the high specific surface areas of the G-h-BN, ILs are highly dispersed on G-h-BN, giving the promising exposure of catalytically active sites during the reaction. Additionally, it can be seen from Fig. 1c that the E2g values and FWHM of [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN, [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN and [Bmim]HCOO/G-h-BN were almost the same as those of G-h-BN, proving that the immobilization process makes no aggregation of G-h-BN. Ultraviolet−visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–vis DRS) of G-h-BN, [Bmim]H2PO4 and [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN are performed in Fig. 1d. A weak broad peak around 350nm of [Bmim]H2PO4 was observed (Fig. 1d). While a sharp peak at 240nm was found in the spectra of G-h-BN, which was also observed in the UV–vis DRS spectrum of [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN. Due to the little mass ratio of [Bmim]H2PO4 in [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN, the weak peak of [Bmim]H2PO4 cannot be seen in [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN, giving the proof of high dispersion of TSILs on the G-h-BN. Since no characteristic peaks for TSILs in the heterogeneous catalysts can be observed, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN was introduced to investigate the compositions and elemental chemical states of [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN and shown in Fig. 2 a. The existence of B, N, C, O and P in [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN showed that the existence of both G-h-BN and TSILs. The binding energy for B 1s is shown in Fig. 2b. The peak at 190.6eV was indexed to the bonding of B-N [47], while the peak at 192.1eV was indexed to the bonding of B-OH on the surface of G-h-BN [48]. Simultaneously, the binding energy for N 1s peak around 398.4eV is shown in Fig. 2c, which is consistent with the peak of N3+ of BN interlayer [48]. The peak locates around 401.0eV was assigned to N in imidazole ring of TSILs, demonstrating the existence of TSILs on the surface of G-h-BN. The B 1s and N 1s binding energies matched well with the previous report for h-BN, which demonstrates that the structure of G-h-BN is not changed after immobilizing [Bmim]H2PO4. The binding energy for P 2p in [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN is presented in Fig. 2d, and the binding energy for P 2p was 134.5eV, indicating that the anionic of [Bmim]H2PO4 in [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN is H2PO4 2−, which is consistent with the previous report [49]. To illuminate the spatial structures of the samples, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and the N2 adsorption-desorption characterizations were performed. As we can see from the SEM images of G-h-BN and [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN in Fig. S2, both the G-h-BN and [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN showed a thin-film structure, which were representive strucutures of two-dimensional materials, indicating that the immobilization process gives no change to the layer structure of G-h-BN. Furthermore, the TEM characterization also confirms the conclusions from SEM images. As we can see from Fig. 3 a, the as-prepared G-h-BN showed a graphene-like structure. Meanwhile, TEM image of [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN in Fig. 3b demonstrated that the structure of G-h-BN has not been destroyed. However, in the zoom-in TEM image of [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN in Fig. 3c, there were numerous small black dots which stand for [Bmim]H2PO4, illustrating that the ILs are uniformly dispersed on the surface of G-h-BN. Due to the rather high dispersion, the ILs cannot show crystal textures, resluting in the dispearance of peaks in FT-IR spectra, XRD patterns, Raman and UV–vis DRS spectra. The highly dispersed property of ILs is the main origin of the sharp redcution of ILs dosage. In order to research the stability of the combination between [Bmim]H2PO4 and G-h-BN, the [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN, which has been recycled after reaction and extraction with tetrachloromethane, was characterized by TEM (Fig. 3d), and [Bmim]H2PO4 was still found and highly dispersed. The results illustrate that ionic liquids has been immobilized on the surface of G-h-BN stablely. N2 adsorption-desorption is another strong tool for determination of structure and the all prepared samples were tested by N2 adsorption– desorption and corresponding Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore-size distributions. As we can see from Fig. 4 that both G-h-BN and TSILs/G-h-BN showed type II adsorption- desorption curves according to the IUPAC classifiction. A type H3 hysteresis loops in the relative pressure range of 0.45–1.0 revealled that there existed mesopores. While the slit-shaped pores could also be found due to the abrupt closure at a relative presuure of ∼0.45. The corresponding pore sizes disturbution showed that there were abundant micropores in G-h-BN. However, after immobilizing TSILs, the contents of the micropores decreased obviously, indicating that the micropores can function as “actvie sites” for disintegrating TSILs to small species, giving a high dispersion. Also, the calculated specific surface areas (SSAs) based on BET model for G-h-BN, [Bmim]HSO4/G-h-BN, [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN and [Bmim]HCOO/G-h-BN were 1058m2/g, 551m2/g, 598m2/g and 604m2/g, respectively. The decrement of the SSAs mainly originates from the fill of TSILs into micropores. Due to the highly dispersed TSILs are located in micropores, the TSILs cannot be easily run off during the reaction, making the catalysts rather stable ones. Effect of different reaction systems on sulfur removal Table 2 lists the effect of different catalysts on the sulfur removal using 4,6-DMDBT-containing n-octane as model oil with H2O2 as oxidant. The sulfur removal rate was only 12.9% after reacting 2h with [Bmim]H2PO4 as catalyst and H2O2 as oxidant, which may be ascribed to TSIL’s poor contact to sulfur compounds and H2O2. After immobilizing [Bmim]H2PO4 on G-h-BN, TSILs were dispersed equably on the carrier, and then the sulfur removal rate was greatly improved. When choosing [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN as catalyst and H2O2 as oxidant, the sulfur-containing compounds (4,6-DMDBT) was fully removed at 2h. When choosing [Bmim]HSO4 and [Bmim]HCOO as active species, the promotion of sulfur removal rate could still reach 90.7% and 87.8%, respectively, with H2O2 as oxidant. The better adsorptive property of [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN for 4,6-DMDBT led to the higher concentration of reactants during the reaction process. Higher concentration can promote the reaction process, so that the [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN showed the best catalytic performance. Compared with previous reports in Table 1, the current ODS system only need 2.5mg of acidic TSILs, which reduced sharply. Optimization of oxidative desulfurization parameters The important factors including the effect of system temperature and usage amount of H2O2 were investigated to optimize the reaction condition, and the results were listed in Fig. S3. As shown in Fig. S3, the desulfurzization rate rised with the increasing of usage amount of H2O2 at the same temperature. When the O/S molar ratio was fixed, the desulfurization rate improved continuously with the increment of temperature, because the higher reaction temperature is beneficial to the reaction process. In the oxidative desulfurization system, the deulfurization rate reaches 100% at the optimized conditions (T =60°C, n(O)/n(S)=4，t =2h). Effect of additional disrupting chemicals on sulfur removal There is only one model sulfide in the model oil used during the experiments, while there are many components in the real fuel like olefins, aromatics and many other compounds. In order to investigate the effect of oil composition on sulfur removal, toluene, paraxylene and cyclohexene, respectively, were selected as distractors adding to the model oil to investigate its effect on sulfur removal, and the results were shown in Fig. 5 . As shown, the sulfur removals after 2h reactions were 100%, 98.9%, 98.2% with 5wt% toluene, paraxylene and cyclohexene addition, respectively. The sulfide (4,6-DMDBT) can be fully removed by extending the reaction time to 2.5h. The experimental results proved that the catalysis of as-prepared catalyst ([Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN) was hardly affected by distractors, and the catalyst has the potential value of practical application. Effect of different substrates on the sulfur removal To study the catalyic effect of [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN for various sulfur compounds, catalytic performance on four kinds of refractory sulfur compounds (DBT, 4,6-DMDBT, 3-MBT and BT) were evaluated (Fig. 6 ). The catalytic activities of catalysts for different sulfur compounds are mainly affected by space steric hindrance and the electron density. As is shown from Fig. 6, the reactivity of sulfur removal showed a decrease trend in the order: 4,6-DMDBT>DBT>3-MBT>BT, illustrating that the catalytic activities of [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN for different sulfur compounds are hardly affected by space steric hindrance, but mainly influenced by electron densities and space structures of sulfur compounds [50–53]. There are two benzene rings in 4,6-DMDBT and DBT, so the interaction forces between G-h-BN and 4,6-DMDBT or DBT are stronger than 3-MBT and BT, which is conducive to desulfurization experiment. The electron density of 4,6-DMDBT (5.623) is larger than that of DBT (5.576), hence, the catalytic performance of [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN for 4,6-DMDBT is better than that for DBT [54]. The electron densities of 3-MBT and BT are 5.588 and 5.585, respectively, therefore, the catalysis effect of [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN for 3-MBT is better than that for BT. The recycling performance of [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN Recycling performance is an important index for evaluating a catalyst. Thus, the recycling performance for [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN was investigated on the removal of 4,6-DMDBT in model oil, and the result was presented in Table 3 . Since the synthetic [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN is a heterogeneous catalyst, it is easy to separate the catalyst from the reaction system after the desulfurization reaction. The catalyst was separated by decanting directly after the first run. And then the wet catalyst was dried in a 100°C oven to remove the residual model oil and H2O2. Then, fresh model oil and H2O2 were added into the reactor for the next reaction. The result indicated that the removal rate of 4,6-DMDBT can still reach 97.4% after recycling for five times, demonstrating that [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN catalyst was stable. Nonetheless, the desulfurization rate decreased with the increasing of recycling times, which may be ascribed to that more and more precipitation (4,6-DMDBTO2) covered some active species of [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN, leading to the decreasing in sulfur removal rate. The possible mechanism of the desulfurization system In this desulfurization system, the mechanism of adsorption combined with catalytic oxidative desulfurization procedure is proposed. 4,6-DMDBT and H2O2 are firstly adsorbed onto the surface of [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN to form a partial high concentration. Then, DBT molecules are oxidized to its corresponding sulfones by H2O2. In order to further understand the reaction mechanism, GC–MS analysis of the sulfide oxidation process in the model oil and the catalyst phase was performed (Figs. S4 and S5). Typically, the upper model oil phase was withdrawn and analyzed directly by GC−MS, while the used catalyst phase was extracted by tetrachloromethane, and then the resultant solution was analyzed by GC–MS. As seen from Fig. S4, the remnant sulfur specie in the model oil is only 4,6-DMDBT and there are no oxidized sulfur species during the whole reaction, indicating that oxidation products can separate from the model oil easily. Whereas, there are 4,6-DMDBT and 4,6-DMDBTO2, indicating that 4,6-DMDBTO2 is the oxidation product (Fig. S5). The above results illustrated that the removal of 4,6-DMDBT with the adsorption combined with catalytic oxidative desulfurization procedure, and confirms the proposed reaction process. Conclusion In summary, three kinds of heterogeneous catalysts ([Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN, [Bmim]HSO4/G-h-BN and [Bmim]HCOO/G-h-BN) were synthesized and employed its application in adsorption combined with catalytic oxidative desulfurization system. The catalysts were characterized by a series of analysis methods, indicating that the Brönsted acidic ionic liquids were successfully immobilized with a highly uniform dispersion on the surface of G-h-BN. The study found that [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN was the better catalyst during the desulfurization reaction and it combined the advantages of [Bmim]H2PO4 and G-h-BN, functioning as both adsorbent and catalyst during the reaction process. The sulfur removal of 4,6-DMDBT-containing model oil reached 100% at 60°C and hardly affected by distractors, having a potential value of practical application. [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN has such an excellent catalytic performance, which can be assigned to the G-h-BN with large surface area, highly dispersing with IL, enough exposed active sites to interact with sulfides and H2O2, and prominent adsorption ability of sulfides and H2O2 with special layered structure. Moreover, the catalyst still remain high activity after recycling five times. GC–MS analysis illustrated that the removal of 4,6-DMDBT coupled with the adsorption combined with catalytic oxidative desulfurization procedure. Considering of the advantages of the heterogeneous catalyst, it would continue to be widely applied in other reactions.

        "dc:description": "Catalytic oxidation of aromatic sulfur compounds for separation from fuel oils has turned to be an important theme in environmental protection. However, most current reports focused on metal-based catalysts, resulting in high costs and potential secondary pollution to fuel oils. In this work, three metal-free brönsted acid ionic liquids were prepared and anchored onto graphene-like hexagonal boron nitride (G-h-BN) to gain metal-free, heterogeneous catalysts. The heterogenization process not only provided convenience to recycling of the catalysts, but also supplied a sharply decreased ILs dosage. Notably, the prepared catalyst [Bmim]H2PO4/G-h-BN held the best catalytic activity, a ∼100% of catalytic activity can be gained in catalytic oxidation of 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6-DMDBT), which has been regarded as the most stubborn sulfide in industrial hydrodesulfurization (HDS). It was also found that distractors in fuels showed almost no influence on catalytic oxidation of 4,6-DMDBT. Besides, the catalytic oxidation product was also investigated to propose a possible reaction mechanism. The heterogeneous metal-free catalyst were recycled for 5 times without significant decrease in catalytic performance.",
