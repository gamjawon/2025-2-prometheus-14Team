SIVARAJ, B. MAHIPAL REDDY and P. KANTA RAO Catalysis Section, Regional Research Laboratory, Hyderabad 500 007 (India) (Received March 1, 1988; accepted April 6, 1988) The structure and reactivity of CuO/Q^Oa, CuO/ZnO and CuO/ZnO/ A12O3 catalysts are currently the subject of numerous investigations, especial- ly with respect to methanol synthesis [1 - 3]. Monovalent copper in these catalysts has been proposed to be the active centre for the synthesis of methanol from CO and H^ at low temperature and pressure. Herman et al. [4], on the basis of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, proposed that Cu+ dissolved in the ZnO lattice is the catalytically active species for methanol synthesis. Apai et al. [5], using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, have shown a direct correlation between the amount of stable surface Cu\"1\" and the activity for methanol formation. Having established the fact of a Cu\"*^ species responsible for methanol synthesis activity, in this communication we report a novel method for selective enhancement of the Cu\"1\" species in CuO/ZnO/ A12O3 catalyst via nitrous oxide decomposition. The active Cu\"1\" species is estimated quantitatively by a double isotherm CO chemisorption technique. The CuO/ZnO/Al203 catalysts with various copper loadings were prepared by the deposition-precipitation technique using urea as hydro- lysing agent. In a typical experiment ~20 g 7-alumina fine powder was suspended in a solution containing the required amounts of Cu(N03)2, Zn(N03)2 and urea. The resulting mixture was heated to 90 C with constant stirring. After precipitation was complete, the resulting solids were filtered, dried at 110 C and finally calcined at 400 C for 24 h. A standard volumet- ric high vacuum system with the facility for reducing the samples in situ by flowing hydrogen was used for CO chemisorption and N^0 decomposition study. The standard procedure employed was reduction of the catalyst sample for 5 h at 250 C, followed by evacuation for 2 h (10~6 ton- vacuum) at the same temperature prior to N20 decomposition and/or CO chemisorp- tion. Nitrous oxide decomposition was carried out at 90 C for 5 h and then evacuated for 2 h at the same temperature. Before introduction of CO, the system was further evacuated for 1 h at the temperature of chemisorption (25 C). Introducing purified CO (Matheson, 99.9%), the first adsorption isotherm (I) representing the sum of physisorbed (reversibly adsorbed) and 0304-5102/88/$3.50 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 18 chemisorbed (irreversibly adsorbed) CO was determined. The physisorbed CO was then removed by evacuating for l h at the same temperature. Imme- diately afterwards, a second isotherm (II) representing only the physisorbed CO was generated. This second isotherm corresponds to the physisorbed CO, and the difference between I and II corresponds to the chemisorbed CO. The CO adsorption isotherms before and after N^O decomposition on a typical catalyst are shown in Fig. 1. It appears from Fig. 1 that the physi- sorbed and chemisorbed CO can be determined more precisely and accurate- ly via this double isotherm method. The physisorbed CO corresponds to metallic Cu species, whereas the chemisorbed CO is specific to Cu\"1\" species on the catalyst surface [3]. The physisorbed and chemisorbed quantities of CO on various catalysts are shown in Fig. 2. It can be noted from Fig. 2 that the amount of physisorbed CO is more (Fig. 2A) compared to the chemi- sorbed one, on the prereduced catalysts. Upon N30 decomposition, a reversing phenomena can be seen and a considerable enhancement in Cu+ concentration, as reflected by chemisorbed CO, can also be noted from Fig. 2B. An important point here is that practically no adsorption, neither 10 10 so 100 150 200 Pressure , mm Hg Fig. 1.

Another important observation to be noted from Fig. 2 is that the volume of physi- sorbed as well as chemisorbed CO increases as a function of Cu/(Cu + Zn) and reaches a maximum at a ratio of 0.3, after which it decreases sharply with further copper loading. Very interestingly, this optimum composition corresponds to a Cu:Zn atomic ratio of 3:7, at which a maximum activity for methanol synthesis was reported [3]. The reduced CuO/ZnO/Al203 catalyst consists of copper essentially as Cu and a lesser amount of Cu'1\" species under the conditions employed in this study. Due to its high concentration, the Cu species is partially in- accessible to the physisorbed (weakly adsorbed) CO. Hence, the total up- takes before and after NsO decomposition are not equal on various catalysts. Nitrous oxide decomposition converts the Cu species to a Cu\"1' species which can hold CO more strongly. In conclusion, it is possible to enhance Cu+ species on CuO/ZnO/Al203 catalysts three- or four-fold using N 20 decom- position. 20 Acknowledgement We thank CSIR, India for the award of a research fellowship to C.S.
