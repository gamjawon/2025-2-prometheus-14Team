Introduction The good prospects for the use of heterogenized metal complexes as catalysts are well known (see for example Ref. [1]). Especial importance is found when it is desired to associate high catalytic selectivity and activity with easy and thorough removal of the catalyst from the reagents. This requirement is needed for hydrosilylation catalysis, perhaps the most efficient and economical route to organosilanes [2,3], in which expensive platinum metal compounds are very efficient [3]. On the other hand, in homogeneous catalysis, it is also well known that the solvent of solubilization of H2PtCl6 M Corresponding author.

PIIS1381-1169(96)00152-5 plays an important part in the formation of the catalytic species [4]. It is now well agreed that these catalytic species are low oxidation state Pt species which have colloidal character [5]. In connection with our interest on the preparation of industrial silylated monomers, we needed an efficient, easily removed and reusable catalyst. Moreover, this catalyst must be convenient at ambient temperature and as neutral as possible in order to prevent monomers polymerization. Among numerous catalysts described in the literature, one alumina-supported platinum catalyst appeared to be a good candidate. Such a catalyst was previously described by Capka and Hetflejs [6] but unfortunately it offered low reactivity and a high cost of preparation. We describe in this paper improvements in the preparation of such a catalyst and conse- 312 Y.

These properties were found to be related to the temperature and the solvent used during the coordination step of the platinum species on the support. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials and procedure Alumina (aluminium oxide 60 active, basic activity 1, 63-200 [,, Merck) was pre-treated under vacuum (20 mm Hg) at 100 during 24 h. Trichloro-vinylsilane, chlorodiphenylphosphine, 1-octene and dimethylphenylsilane were purchased from Aldrich and used as such. H2PtC16 (ca. 40% Pt) was purchased from Janssen and used as such. All the solvents were purified by reported literature procedures. Elemental analyses were performed by CNRS laboratory (Vemaison). The platinum contents were verified using colorimetric titrations according to Ref. [7] on a UV-vis Secoman spectrometer at elm. = 403 nm. Gas chromatographic analyses were performed on a Shimadzu GC-8A instrument equipped with a Merck D2500 integrator. The analyses were accomplished with the internal standard method using a HP1 12 m capillary column and temperature programming. After isolation by flash chromatography, identifications of the reactions products were performed by IR, NMR and GC-MS techniques ~~^1 CI3Si-CH=CHz AI203 ~'OH AIZ03~0-Si PhH, reflux, 20 h. i Ph2PCl , Li wires - pAIp03~_ -0 Si-CHp-CHZ-PPhz I O PhH , reflux, 20 h.

Phosphinated support preparation The support was prepared according to Ref. [6] by a modified procedure using chlorodiphenylphosphine and lithium wires in order to avoid the use of expensive diphenylphosphine (Scheme 1). In a typical experiment, a mixture of 15 g of alumina, 10 g of trichlorovinylsilane and 50 ml of benzene was kept under mild reflux during 20 h. The support, separated by filtration, was then washed successively with 30 ml of benzene, a mixture of 30 ml of ethanol and 1.5 ml of pyridine, 30 ml of a 10% sodium carbonate solution and finally 30 ml of dry ethanol. It was then dried under vacuum (20 mm Hg) at 75 during 16 h.

[9]. The mixture was heated at 70 during 16 h. After cooling, the so treated support was filtered, washed thrice successively with 100 ml of benzene and 100 ml of ethanol, and dried under vacuum at 80 during 16 h (C: 3.68%; H: 1.04%; Si: 2.03%; P: 0.39%). 2.3. Pt/A1203 catalyst preparation (general procedure) 0.3 g (or 1 g for catalysts described in Table 1) of hexachloroplatinic acid (ca. 40% Pt) was reacted with 15 g of the phosphinated support in an appropriate solvent under the temperature conditions recorded in tables. Note that preparations at 100 in ethanol, isopropanol or ethanol-benzene solution were conducted in sealed tubes (internal pressure near to 1.25 atm). After 2 h (or 24 h at room temperature), the so prepared catalyst was separated by filtration with suction and washed thrice with dry ethanol. The catalyst was then dried at 75 during 16 h (C: 3.48%; H: 1.01%; Si: 2.00%; P: 0.38%, for the catalyst prepared in n-butanol at 90). 2.4. Procedure for test hydrosilylation runs The reaction was carried out under normal atmosphere in a 50 ml Schlenk tube equipped with a reflux condenser and a magnetic stirrer. The reactor was charged with 100 mg of catalyst and a solution of 1-octene (10 mmol), triethylsilane or dimethylphenylsilane (10 mmol) and decane as internal standard (2 mmol) was dropwise added over a period of 2 min. The mixture was stirred at 25. It must be noted that many reactions were exothermic. In order to correctly compare our results, all hydrosilylation runs were conducted in thermostated conditions. The course of the reaction was monitored by removing samples of the reaction mixture at 313 fixed intervals. After filtration through glass wool, the reaction yields were determined by gas chromatography analyses. The turnover numbers (expressed in s-1) were calculated from the yields after 5 min. The catalysts used in repeated runs were removed from the reaction mixture by centrifugation. It was reused after washing with ethanol (5 ml) and drying under vacuum (20 mm Hg) during 16 h at room temperature. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Exploratory experiments In exploratory experiments, we found that a catalyst prepared according to Ref. [6] showed a low activity in hydrosilylation of 1-octene with dimethylphenylsilane at room temperature (Scheme 2). Indeed, less than 5% of silylated adducts were formed after 24 h of reaction. Using modified procedure for the preparation of the support (see Experimental) the results were quite similar (run 1, Table 1). GC analyses of the crude products showed that the reaction was largely limited by the classical isomerization of 1-octene into unreactive internal olefins [10]. Thus, we decided to modify the temperature used during the coordination step (Scheme 1). We found that a catalyst prepared using a refluxed ethanol-benzene (1 / 1) solution exhibited a threefold activity (compare runs 1 and 3, Table 1). The same beneficial effect was observed for the catalysts prepared in ethanol (runs 2 and 4). These latter catalysts exhibited higher activity than the previous ones. These significant solvent and temperature effects led us to SiMe2Ph C13H8~ PhMeZSiH PUAIZ03 catalyst room temperature a-adduct (minor) ,SiMe2Ph p-adduct (major) Scheme 2. Hydrosilylation of 1-octene with dimethylphenylsilane. 314 Y. Fort et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 112 (1996) 311-316 use n-butanol which allowed a higher reflux temperature. Moreover, this solvent has often been described in the preparation of functional polystyrene supported complexes [9]. In these conditions, the obtained catalyst, named Pt/A1203(n-butanel, reflux)~ contained 18 mg Pt per g and was found as more active than the previous ones (run 5, Table 1). The hydrosilylation yield reached up to 95% within 4 h at room temperature. These interesting properties motivated us to examine the ability of Pt/A1203(n-butanol, reflex) to be recycled. Unfortunately, we found that the catalyst activity was strongly decreased after three repeated runs. This deactivation may be related to metal leaching during hydrosilylation. Indeed, the initial Pt content of the catalyst was 18 mg per g (9.2 X 10-2 mmol) while it was only 8 mg per g (4.1 X 10-Z mmol) after the second use. These results indicated that the platinum species were not irreversibly linked to the support [11,12]. The explanation may be that using the modified procedure described, the functionality of the prepared support was near to 0.125 mmol of phosphino group per g and did not ensure an efficient coordination of the platinum species. It is classically admitted that the optimal phosphine:metal ratio must be equal to 2:1 [12]. We then decided to engage only 8 mg Pt per g of support during the following catalyst preparations. It must be noted that we Table 2 Influence of the solvent of preparation for a fixed temperature of 100 have subsequently verified that using higher ratio platinum leaching was observed. 3.2. Effects of the solvent used during the coordination step The above results prompted us to next examine the effects of various alcohols, used as solvent during the coordination step, on Pt/A1203 hydrosilylating activity. All catalysts were prepared at 100 in various solvents. The hydrosilylating properties were tested in the hydrosilylation of 1-octene with dimethylphenylsilane at room temperature (Scheme 2) and the obtained results are reported in Table 2. We found that the platinum content and the hydrosilylating activity of a catalyst were dependent on the solvent used for its preparation. However, the catalytic activity must not be completely correlated to the platinum content. For example, the use of an ethanol-benzene mixture, ethanol or n-pentanol as solvent led to high platinum contents with strongly different activities (runs 1, 2 and 5, respectively). Finally, it appeared that n-pentanol was the most appropriated solvent of preparation. Indeed, Pt/A1203(n-pentano1,100) allowed a rapid and complete reaction and the highest turnover number (run 5). In terms of rate, yields and selectivity (up to 95% of adduct), our catalyst gave comparable results as H2PtC16.

Fort et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 112 (1996) 311-316 315 conclude that the reaction mechanism is not fundamentally different than the Chalk and Harrods one [13]. It must also be hypothesized that the used conditions allow the efficient reduction of Pt(IV) in active and stable low oxidation state platinum species as described for Speief's catalyst [14]. This assumption is consistent with the fact that no induction period is observed with Pt/A1203. However, at this time, these unprecedented solvent effects are difficult to understand. The dependence of the catalytic activity on the nature of the alcohol used during the preparation is probably due to some structural modifications of the support. If under our conditions, the alcohol reacts with the support, it may be assumed that steric interactions can suppress a possible dimerization of the reactive catalytic intermediates resulting in enhancement of activity as described for immobilized rhodium complexes [15]. The bulkiness of the lipophilic chain of the alcohol must then have a predominant role. 3.3. Effects of the temperature used during the coordination step We then examined the influence of the temperature used during the coordination step conducted in n-pentanol. The results obtained with these catalysts are gathered in Table 3. It appeared that the catalytic activity was strongly dependent on the temperature used. We found that Pt/A12031pentanoL90l exhibited the highest Table 3 Influence of the temperature of preparation in n-pentanol Run Catalyst catalytic activity during the hydrosilylation of 1-octene with dimethylphenylsilane. The reaction obtained was nearly instantaneous (run 2). In order to determine the maximum turnover number of this catalyst, we performed an hydrosilylation run by using only 50 mg of catalyst (run 3). In these conditions, the calculated turnover number (after 5 min) reached 8.13 s -1 showing the exceptional activity of this new catalyst. It must also be underlined that the use of n-pentanol at 90 during the coordination step allowed a complete deposit of the initial platinum species. Indeed, the platinum content of the catalyst Pt/A12031n_pentano1,9o) was equal to 8 mg/g. All other temperature conditions led to a lower platinum content and to less active catalysts. These results indicated that the active species was formed at an optimal temperature. The easy and irreversible reduction of Pt(IV) in inactive Pt(0) is probably favored by high temperatures [2]. If our hypotheses are valuable, lower temperature do not allow an efficient modification of the support resulting in a less active catalyst. 3.4.

We found that this References catalyst can be used twelve times without signif- icant decrease in activity. The yield obtained during the twelfth run reached up to 95o within 1 h of reaction. We also found that these re peated runs can be performed with a restricted platinum leaching in the reaction medium. A twelve fold used catalyst contained more than 7 mg Pt per g of catalyst. 4. Conclusion In summary, we have shown the large influ ence of the solvent and of the temperature used in the coordination step of the preparation of a platinum supported on alumina catalyst. The use of n-pentanol as solvent at 90 was found as the most appropriate conditions allowing the preparation of a highly active and reusable cata lyst. Applications of this catalyst in the prepara tion of sensitive silylated monomers are cur rently under investigation. Acknowledgements We thank Professor P.
