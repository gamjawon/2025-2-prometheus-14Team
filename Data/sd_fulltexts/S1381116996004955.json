Introduction The variety of stable oxidation states of transition metal ions is believed to be an important factor for catalytic activity of transition metal oxides [1]. If a solid or a cluster contain simultaneously metallic ions of a same element in different oxidation states, one deals with a mixed-valence system. The distribution of valences and accompanying structural relaxation may be of crucial importance for the reactivity at the different sites on the surface. The different valences can be attributed to particular metal sites (localized valence) or several ions can be considered as having an averaged (delocalized) valence [2,3]. We recently studied the role of mixed-va- Corresponding author. 1381-1169/97/$17.00 Copyright 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. PIIS1381-1169(96)00495-5 lence state in trimeric iron-oxygen clusters depicted in iron phosphates and acting as active sites in the catalysis of oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutyric acid [4]. Structure relaxation of this cluster favors the delocalization of excess electron between the central and one of the terminal octahedra of the cluster. Reduction of initially homovalent cluster occurs under adsorption of a molecule of isobutyric acid. The delocalization of excess electron allows intramolecular electron transfer to a ferric site of the same cluster where the OH group is coadsorbed. The mechanism of the intramolecular electron transfer singles out trimeric cluster from similar, yet more extended, systems also studied experimentally [5]. In the latter, the electron delocalization covers a higher number of sites and a smaller part of the excess electron density is accessible for interaction with an adsorbed 328 V. Robert et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 119 (1997) 327-333 molecule. In contrast, the extra electron in dimeric cluster is almost strictly localized at one center. Another example of mixed-valence systems appears in the heterogeneous catalysis of selective oxidation of n-butane. Vanadyl pyrophosphate (VO)ZPZO7 is known to be the active and selective phase for the oxidation of n-butane into maleic anhydride [6-8]. It formally contains vanadium ions in the oxidation state +IV. However, experimental studies showed that partial oxidation of V 1v exposed to oxygen occurs in the initial step of active phase preparation [9]. Moreover, the formation of maleic anhydride requires the participation of V 'v and V v sites in a sufficiently close vicinity [10]. The presence of V Iv-V v mixed-valence pairs in the calcined catalysts was confirmed by XRD, FT-IR, EPR and EXAFS techniques [ 11 ]. Till now, the most complete study of maleic anhydride formation on a vanadyl pyrophosphate surface was done by Schit et al. [12] (see also Ref. [13]). However, they only considered homovalent (tetra- or pentavalent) one-layer clusters and chains to model the surface. In the present communication, we would like to study the role of mixed-valence state in the heterogeneous catalytic oxidation of butane. The traps-bipyramidal V208 cluster unit (Fig. la) often completed by adjacent P04 tetrahedra is usually chosen to represent the (010) surface of O q~.. ~\\ O /n .

However, some recent data seem to indicate that presence of V v is linked to the reorientation of vanadyl groups leading to C'S-V208 cluster (Fig. lb) [14]. Moreover, the participation of a few sublayers thanks to an oxygen atoms diffusion process has been supported by 18 0 labelling studies [15]. Besides, our preliminary ab initio calculations showed that excess electron in the traps-V208 ' clusters is likely to occupy a dyZ orbital, reflecting the vanadyl V=O group sensitivity to oxidation state changes [16]. The simplest model accounting for the coupling within V=O ~ ~ ~ V stacks consists of a tetrameric vanadium-oxygen cluster (Fig. 2). Earlier we studied the charge distributions and structural relaxation in such mixedvalence clusters with different ratios V lv: V v [17]. We were here concerned with the catalytic properties of these clusters. However, the mechanism of the reaction considered below differs from that studied in Ref. [12]. The roles of lattice and chemisorbed oxygen in the selective oxidation of n-butane are still far from clear. Recent experimental results have shown that only lattice surface oxygen atoms were active in the formation of malefic anhydride [15]. So, we considered the adsorption of dihydrofuran on mixed-valence cluster (Fig. 2) and possible attack of lattice electrophilic oxygen on the basis of an extended Hkel (eH) approach. 2.

This correction technique (Anderson theory) based on a two-body repulsive energy was included into the original eH program [ 19]. It was noticed that, since the electron interactions in the overlap regions are omitted, the binding energy curves are usually too deep. Nevertheless, the method is likely to predict reasonable bond lengths [20]. The diagonal matrix elements and orbital exponents for atoms are summarized in Table 1, whereas a modified weighted Wolfsberg-Helmoltz formula with a distance dependent coefficient [20] was used to approximate off-diagonal matrix elements. It should be pointed out that other parametrization may be found in the literature [21 ] but qualitative description we worked on is certainly not significantly modified. The possible charge redistribution process was examined in terms of Mulliken definition of atomic charges. For some model systems, ab initio HartreeFock and DFT (density functional theory) calculations were also performed (see below). 3. Vanadyl pyrophosphate model Let us start with the analysis of a clean vanadyl pyrophosphate. As it was shown earlier [12], the extended models and discrete clusters 329 with and without attached phosphorous groups give similar results for electronic characteristics of vanadium and oxygen atoms. We ourselves focused on the vanadium-oxygen framework, since we noticed that the structure which attaches P03 units modelling the pyrophosphates did not lead to any significant changes in the calculated equilibrium geometries and related charge redistributions between different vanadium sites in mixed-valence clusters. Bond distances and angles were taken as average values of experimental data [22]. We first analyzed the charge distribution in VZOx dimer (Fig. la) in mixed-valence state with total charge - 7. The localization of an `excess' electron at one site is due to the desymmetrizing distortions [2,3]. We limited ourselves to a single distortion involving the shortening of one and the lengthening of the other V=O bond. We found that the symmetric geometry is stable against this distortion. Therefore, both vanadium sites are in the same average oxidation state + 4.5. We were then concerned with symmetric geometries of tetrameric mixed-valence vanadium-oxygen clusters. These structures result from the binding of two VzOx dimers. Nevertheless, two additional weakly bound OZions 05 and 06 were included in our model (Fig. 3) to depict infinite chains along the [010] direction and to stress the experimentally observed oxygen mobility in this direction [ 15]. 05 atom can also represent the oxygen atom of 2,5-dihydrofuran molecule when the latter is adsorbed on the surface. One should note that the environment of each vanadium atom is very close one to another but minor differences appear in the second coordination spheres. Consequently, such a structure is convenient to study charge reorganization accompanying desymmetrizing distortions. Again, we only considered the oxygen atoms displacements along the V=O ~ ~ ~ V bond. Fig. 3 shows the distortion associated with electron trapping characterized by OR1, ORz and OR3, and gathers geometric parameters. Three different electronic mixed-valence configurations were examined, namely 330 21. .15~1 3.9A V Robert etal.lJourital of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 1190997) 327-333 ---------- * ?5 ~ AR3 VI o , \"` (I2 f ~ `~O ____ V1\"` .'001 V2 _ *000 : OI II 1~'~O* `O 004JAR9 O 06~' ~1R3 Fig. 3.

The system may be considered as a four dcenter cluster belonging to symmetry group C2,with different numbers of `excess' electrons. Reduction of the four-Vv cluster is associated with filling of two quasi-degenerate orbitals (Fig. 4a) with one, two or three electrons.

As a general feature, all initial symmetric geometries were found unstable and equilibrium distances and vanadium charges are summed up in Tables 0 2 and 3. a The V=O distances vary from 1.62 A to 1.68 A. Differences in V=O distances from 0 0 1.57 A to 1.73 A were also observed experimentally [22]. The calculated distortion transforms as A 2 representation. Consequently, frontier orbitals A1 and BZ are likely to mix with mainly oxygen orbitals of A 2 and B 1 symmetries, respectively. The most suitable candidate for interaction is vacant B t orbital (Fig. 4b) lying few electron-volts higher. This interaction is most efficient when HOMO is BZ orbital, i.e. electronic configuration do-d'-d'-d' (3V 'v + 1Vv).

Since JORleql _ J0 Rj, `cross-delocalization' (i.e. equal populations) between these two sites, as well as between sites V2 and V4, is observed.

Therefore, interaction with adsorbed molecules is likely to occur on the Lewis acid site, namely Vl, while 02 atom turns to be the most suitable for an electrophilic attack. As a matter of fact, a substantial decrease in the overlap population for the V2-02 double bond is calculated while oxygen atom charge slightly increases (Table 4). Besides, one can assume that V4 bulk atom may also participate in the electrophilic attack since it can be easily oxidized as seen from `cross-delocalization'. Finally, the relative softness of the system displayed by (ORt, ORZ)eq may be a reflection of the lattice oxygen migration. Our preliminary Hartree-Fock and DF17 calculations led to very similar results for both binuclear and tetranuclear models [16]. We again observed delocalized electronic distribution for the former and localized one for the latter. Besides, equilibrium metal-oxygen distances are close to those found with the ASED method. 4. 2,5-dihydrofuran oxidation The detailed mechanism of malefic anhydride formation on a vanadyl pyrophosphate surfaces is still far from clear. It cannot be excluded that different structural units, including those containing phosphorous, may participate in different elementary acts of the reaction. We studied the role of mixed-valence state in the 2,5-dihydrofuran oxidative dehydrogenation which is proposed to be one of the possible steps of 331 catalytic reaction. Thus, we did not pay attention in our model to formation mechanism of this intermediate. 2,5-dihydrofuran molecule was built out of the MAD (molecular advanced design) code and geometrical parameters optimizations were then performed using ab initio SCF type calculations. It is observed that the four carbon and the oxygen atoms are almost coplanar. The adsorption was studied on vanadium-oxygen mixedvalence clusters with different electron countings and relaxed geometry described in the previous section. We chose V 1 atom as the adsorption site (Fig. 5). Therefore, the dihydrofuran oxygen substitutes for the weakly bonded oxygen 05. This adsorption site differs from that studied in Ref. [12] where adsorption occurred on V2 (Fig. 1 a). In our geometry, the dihydrofuran molecule can interact with the vanadyl oxygen, thus allowing the participation of lattice oxygen as suggested in Ref. [15]. Additional optimizations of the dihydrofuranV 1 distance were performed leading to 0 R 3 equal to - 0.03 Then, the question raised about the relative orientation of dihydrofuran ring relatively to the surface. The structure with the ring along the y-direction was found most stable as in Ref. [ 12]. However, the 90rotated ring conformation is less favorable by only 0.5 eV. From these calculations, no specific H H OS O, 02 '001111 0 Il o o~o~o/ 0 0 Fig. 5. Adsorption of 2,5-dihydrofuran on model catalyst. 332 V. Robert et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 119 (1997) 327-333 conformation of 2,5-dihydrofuran ring could be chosen as the most favorable. Therefore, we concentrated on the conformation for which the 02-nearest neighbor hydrogen atom lies in xyplan. The fragment molecular approach showed that 2,5-dihydrofuran fragment HOMO is likely to interact with low-lying antibonding d-orbitals of [V4019] (n = 18, 19, 20) fragment (Fig. 6). By this interaction, the C-H bonding character of HOMO is reduced, leading to possible cleavage of this bond. Within the framework of our model, it can be then concluded that an O-H bond is expected to be made with participation of lattice oxygen. However, a rather large O-H distance (1.55 was found and small O-H overlap population is observed (= 0.01). More accurate calculations must be performed to get more realistic values. We must mention one special feature directly linked to the mixed-valence state of our model tetramer. Up to now, the homovalent all V lv electronic configuration has not been examined since V v turned out to be required in the catalytic process. In terms of frontier orbitals interactions, we focused again on [V4019]19- fragment LUMO of ddd'-d' configuration (-10.6 eV) and 2,5-dihydrofuran fragment HOMO (-12.5 eV) (Fig. 7). Overlap between these two molecular orbitals is very small ( = 0.001). So, one can expect that the addition of an extra electron leading to a three-electron interaction and to ddl-dl-dl configuration is not destabilizing. However, any four-electron ~k--0 O 0 Fig. 6. 2,5-dihydrofuran HOMO (- 10.5 eV) interaction with low-lying antibonding d-orbitals of [V40191 cluster. Fig. 7. 2,5-dihydrofuran HOMO interaction with [V40,9119LUMO of do-dd' -dl configuration (-10.6 eV). interaction is unfavored and this may be the reason why presence of about 250 of V v appears to be optimal for stabilization of 2,5-dihydrofuran adsorbed on our model cluster. 5. Conclusions This simplified quantum model enabled us to investigate the effects of simultaneous presence of V lv and V v ions in the vanadium pyrophosphate lattice. The account of several sublayers seems to be necessary to get an accurate description of the structural relaxation accompanying catalyst oxidation. On the basis of different considerations, a similar model was recently proposed [23]. Charge redistribution displayed `cross-delocalization' between pairs of vanadium sites whereas bond lengths relaxation accounted for the observed softness of V=O . . . V bond. For any electronic configuration, fragment molecular orbitals analysis showed that participation of lattice oxygen of vanadyl group has to be considered in the step of 2,5-dihydrofuran oxidation. Even if the reacting oxygenhydrogen distance is large (1.55 compared to usual O-H distances, this possible path for mechanism cannot be excluded. Of course, the ASED method is too approximate to give reliable enough values of geometric parameters and charges. However, it is useful to depict the general trends in catalyst behavior. Besides, the whole space of possible V. Robert et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 119 (1997) 327-333 structural distortions should be studied. Full geometry relaxation would be the most appropriate way to precisely look into the role of lattice oxygen. But more sophisticated quantum-chemical calculations must be based on similar approaches in the description of mixed-valence state. Acknowledgements We are grateful to M. Abon, J.-M. Millet and J.-C.

Possible path for the interaction of 2,5-dihydrofuran with a lattice vanadyl oxygen leading to the formation of maleic anhydride is considered. It is shown that account of structural relaxation in mixed-valence state is needed to properly describe active site.
