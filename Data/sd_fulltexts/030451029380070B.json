(+39-89) 822423, fax. (+39-89)953804 Abstract The title cationic Cp-free zirconium hydrocarbyl has been synthesized by ligand abstraction from tetrabenzylzirconium with the strong Lewis acid tris (pentafluorophenyl )boron. NMR analysis indicates that the [Zr (CH,Ph )3 ] + cation is stabilized by coordination of the phenyl ring of the anion [B(CH2Ph) (CgF5)3]-, and that this structure is maintained in aromatic solvents up to 100 C. The highly electrophilic zirconium cation reacts rapidly with Uwis bases such as THF, affording the 6-coordinate [Zr(CHZPh)3(THF)3] ' adduct. The title compound is the first nonmetallocene group 4 cationic complex which functions as a single-component olefin polymerization catalyst. Key words: catalyst; cationic complex; olefin; polymerization Introduction The synthesis of cationic dicyclopentadienyl group 4 metal-alkyl complexes [ Cp2MR ] +, usually isolated as their 16-electron base adducts [ Cp2M (R) (L) ] +, is a recent achievement, due to the pioneering studies by Jordan et al. [ 1-3 ] and Bochmann et al. [4,5 ] . However, in the last few years the chemistry of this new class of organometallic compounds has been developed extensively [6-12 ], mainly because complexes of this type are currently believed to be the true active species of the metallocene-based Ziegler-Natta catalytic systems for olefin polymerization [ 13-19 ] . By contrast, little attention has been paid to analogous non-metallocene organometallic compounds, such as monocyclopentadienyl derivatives [ 20 ] or Cp-free hydrocarbyls [21 ], which could also play a role in some homogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts. The low catalytic activity in olefin polymerization of compounds M(CH2Ph)4_nXn (M=Ti or Zr, X=halogen, n=0,1, 2), even in the absence of aluminium cocatalysts, was disclosed by Giannini et al. [ 22-24 ] . *Corresponding author. 0304-5102/93/$06.00 1993 - Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. All rights reserved. 58 C. Pellecchia et al./J. Mol. Catal. 82 (1993) 57-65 Later, Ballard found that supporting these compounds on silica leads to a great increase of catalytic activity [ 25,26 ] . More recently, Giannetti et al. [ 27 ] reported that addition of methylalumoxane to Zr(CHZPh)4 produces an ethylene polymerization catalyst having an activity comparable with that of metallocene-based systems. Subsequently, analogous catalytic systems were reported to promote partially isotactic-specific polymerization of propene, syndiotactic-specific polymerization of styrene, and cis- 1,4-polymerization of butadiene [ 28-30 ] . It is worth noting that metallocene-based catalysts are inactive in polymerization of styrene and conjugated diolefins. Even though several hypotheses concerning the structure of the catalytic species involved have been suggested [ 22-30 ] , only little evidence is available in the literature. We have recently reported [31 ] that group 4 homoleptic hydrocarbyls, e.g. Zr(CH2Ph)4, as well as monocyclopentadienyl compounds, e.g. CpZr(CH2Ph)3, yield active ethylene and propene polymerization catalysts when activated by in situ reaction with one equivalent of the strong Lewis acid tris (pentafluorophenyl )boron, and suggested that the true active species are cationic complexes analogous to those involved in metallocene-based catalytic systems. In order to confirm this hypothesis, we attempted to isolate and characterize the catalytic complexes. Here we report the synthesis, the solution structure and reactivity, and the catalytic activity in olefin polymerization of [Zr(CH2Ph)3]+ [B(CH2Ph)(C6F5)3]-,thefirstexampleofisolated,catalytically active Cp-free group 4 cationic complex. Results and discussion Synthesis and solution structure of (Zr(CH2Ph)3J+ (B(CH2Ph)(C6F5)3J- Treatment of a toluene solution of tetrabenzylzirconium with one equivalent of tris(pentafluorophenyl)boron at room temperature, followed by addition of heptane, results in the precipitation of an orange-red crystalline solid. The product obtained was characterized by 1H- and '3C-NMR analysis. The 1H-NMR spectrum recorded in toluene-d8 at 25 C (see Fig. 1) clearly indicates the migration of a benzyl group from zirconium to boron: two resonances at 8 1.27 and 3.16 with a 3 :1 intensity ratio can actually be attributed to the methylene protons of the benzyl groups bound to Zr and to those of the benzyl group bound to B, respectively. Accordingly, two well separated groups of signals are detected for the aromatic protons, with a 3 :1 intensity ratio. On this basis, the formation of a cationic zirconium complex through ligand abstraction from tetrabenzylzirconium, according to the scheme Zr(CH2Ph)4+B(C6F5)3-+[Zr(CHZPh)3]+[B(CH2Ph)(C6F5)3]- (1) can be inferred. The resonance of the ortho-hydrogens of the Zr-bound benzyl C. Pellecchia et al./J Mol.

The most striking feature of the spectrum, however, is the well resolved doublet-triplet-triplet pattern of the resonances at 66.39, 5.66, and 5.40, attributable to the ortho, meta and para hydrogens of the benzyl group bound to boron, respectively. The upfield shift of the meta and para hydrogens and the downfield shift of the ortho aromatic hydrogens of the BCH2Ph group strongly suggest an rr-coordination of the phenyl ring of the counter anion to Zr. Similar NMR patterns were actually found at low temperature for the complex [ Zr (CHZPh) 3 ] + [ BPh4 ] - [ 21 ] and for ansa-metallocene cationic complexes [ Cp2 Zr (CH3) ] + [ BPh4 ] - (Cp' -bridged q-cyclopentadienyl or indenyl ) [ 33 ] : in the former case an r(-coordination of one boron-bound phenyl ring to Zr was suggested, while in the latter an rP (mp) or a flugional r2 (m,p) -coordination was proposed. Variable temperature NMR experiments show no significant change in the spectrum of (1) in toluene-ds solution between - 60 and 100 C, suggesting a very strong coordination of the phenyl ring. The 13C NMR spectrum of (1) is consistent with this picture. The resonances due to the ortho, meta and para aromatic carbons of the BCHZPh group actually follow the same trend as observed in the 1H spectrum for the corresponding hydrogens: the signal of the ortho carbons at 8129.3 occurs downfield from the corresponding ones due to the meta and para carbons at 8127.1 and 124.2, respectively, while the ipso carbon resonates at 5157.5. On the other hand, according to the literature [ 20,32 ] , the high-field shift of the resonance of the, methylenes bound to Zr, observed at 674.8, and the large JCH value (132 Hz ), measured for the same carbons in the 1H coupled 60 C. Pellecchia et al./J Mol. Catal. 82 (1993) 57-65 13C-NMR spectrum, confirm some r1\"-interaction of the Zr-bound benzyl ligands with the electron-deficient Zr. Variable temperature 1H-NMR experiments performed in dichloromethane-d2show that the solution structure of (1) in polar solvents is temperature dependent (see Fig. 2) . At - 80 C, the resonances due to the aromatic protons of the benzyl ligand migrated to B have the same doublet-triplettriplet pattern (66.71, 6.59, 6.33) as observed in toluene solution.

Catal. 82 (1993) 57-65 61 ortho and meta protons approximate to each other until converge at 0 C in a broad resonance centred at 66.75, while the signal corresponding to the para proton moves from 66.33 at - 80 C to 66.50 at 0 C. This behaviour suggests some fluxionality of the coordinated aromatic ring, probably due to a weaker electrostatic interaction between the cation and the counterion in polar solvents with respect to toluene. Above 0 C, (1) is unstable in dichloromethane and decomposes, probably through Cl abstraction from the solvent. Use of the less reactive tetrachloroethane-d2 (in which the NMR spectra are very similar to those recorded in dichloromethane-d2) allows the performance of NMR experiments at room temperature (see the Experimental section). A single crystal X-ray analysis [34] shows that the solid state structure of (1) is consistent with the solution structure as determined by NMR. Reactivity of (1) Addition of an excess of hexamethylbenzene to a toluene-d8 solution of (1) does not result in any significant change in the NMR spectrum, thus confirming that electrostatic interactions contribute to stabilize the coordination of the benzyl ligand of the counterion to the electrophilic Zr cation [21 ] By contrast, in an analogous experiment, addition of tetrahydrofuran (THF) resulted in the immediate precipitation of a yellow oil, identified as the THF adduct [Zr(CHZPh)3'(THF)3]+[B(CHZPh)(C6F5)3]- (2). The 1HNMRspectrum of (2) in tetrachloroethane-d2 solution (see Fig. 3) actually shows a triplet-triplet-doublet pattern for the resonances of the meta, para, and ortho hydrogens of the benzyl ligands of zirconium at 87.49, 7.36, 6.77, i s s 4 3 z PPM Fig. 3.'H-NMRspectrumof [Zr(CHZPh)3(THF)3]+ [B(CH2Ph)(C6F5)3]- (2) in tetrachlo- roethane-d2 at 25 C. 62 C. Pellecchia et al./J. Mol. Catal. 82 (1993) 57-65 respectively, while a complex multiplet at fi7.20-6.95 is attributed to the aromatic protons of the benzyl group of the `free' anion. Resonances for coordinated THF are observed at 83.97 and 2.00, while the methylene protons bound to zirconium resonate 0.79 ppm downfield with respect to (1) , due to the electron releasing effect of coordinated THF. The 13C NMR spectrum confirms the proposed structure (see the Experimental section). THF seems to be weakly coordinated: actually, it can be partially removed simply by high vacuum pumping, and is displaced by addition of CH3CN, with the formation of a more stable CH3CN adduct (see the Experimental section). Olefinpolymerization activity of (1) and (2) We have recently reported [ 31 ] that tetrabenzylzirconium, activated with one equivalent of B (C6F5) 3, promotes polymerization of ethylene and propene. Compound (1) is an active single-component olefin polymerization catalyst, performing similarly to the catalytic system just cited: ethylene is polymerized in toluene to high molecular weight linear polyethylene with an activity of - 2.5 X 104 g/ (mol of Zr) h atm at 50 C and 5 atm. monomer pressure. Under similar conditions, polymerization of propene affords a mixture of atactic (- 80%) and isotactic (- 20%) polypropylene, with an activity of - 1.5 X 103 g/ (mol of Zr) h atm. With the aim of obtaining some evidence on the polymerization mechanism, some ethylene polymerization tests were performed in an NMR tube. A toluene-d8 solution of (1) was -exposed to 10 equivalents of ethylene at room temperature and the polymerization was monitored by 1H-NMR. While ethylene is slowly consumed during 20 min and a resonance appears simultaneously at 81.20 due to polyethylene, the main resonances of (1) remain unchanged and some additional resonances of lower intensity are detected, suggesting that only a fraction of (1) is involved in the catalysis. A different situation arises when performing a similar experiment in tetrachloroethaned2: in this case, ethylene is consumed more quickly, as may be expected in view of the observed weaker coordination of the counterion to Zr in polar solvents, and most of (1) seems to be involved in the polymerization, as suggested by the appearance of new intense resonances, attributable to the propagating species, in the 1H-NMR spectrum. A detailed NMR study concerning the polymerization mechanism of ethylene and propene in the presence of (1) is in progress and will be published subsequently. Under similar conditions, (2) does not promote the polymerization of ethylene, probably due to unfavourable competition of ethylene with THF for coordination to Zr. However, upon raising the temperature to 60 C, ethylene is rapidly consumed and resonances for polyethylene appear in the 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra. C. Pellecchia et al./J Mol. Catal. 82 (1993) 57-65 63 Experimental General procedures All procedures were carried out under nitrogen by using standard Schlenk or glove-bog techniques. Toluene was purified and dried as described in a previous paper [ 31 ] . n-Heptane was refluged for 48 h over sodium-benzophenone and distilled before use. THF was distilled from LiAIH4 and passed through activated basic alumina prior to use. Toluene-d8 was stored over molecular sieves (3 A). Acetonitrile, tetrachloroethane-d2 and dichloromethane-d2 were filtered through activated basic alumina before use. Polymerization grade ethylene and propene were supplied by SON and used without purification. Tetrabenzylzirconium and tris (pentafluorophenyl) boron were synthesized according to the literature [ 24,35 ] . NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AM 250 spectrometer operating at 250 MHz for 1H and at 62.89 MHz for 13C. The chemical shifts are reported with reference to tetramethylsilane and were determined by reference to residual 1H and 13C solvent peaks. Temperature calibration was performed by measuring the difference of chemical shift between the resonances due to the methyl and the alcoholic protons of a sample of pure methanol. [Zr(CH2Ph)3J + (B(CHZPh) (C6F5 )3J - (1) B (CsF5) 3 (225 mg, 0.5 mmol) was added to a toluene solution of Zr(CH2Ph)4 at room temperature: the colour immediately turned from yellow to orange-red.

On addition of CH3CN, resonances for free THF are detected in the 1H NMR spectrum at 63.64 and 1.77. Polymerization experiments Polymerizations of ethylene and propene were carried out as described previously [ 31 ] . In a typical experiment, polymerization of ethylene proceeded for 15 min in toluene (100 ml, containing 0.1 mmol of Al (CHO 3 as scavenger for impurities) at 50 C and 5 atm monomer pressure with a catalyst concentration of 0.7 mM, affording 2.1 g of linear polyethylene (by NMR). Under similar conditions, polymerization of propene (time 1 h, catalyst concentration 1.0 mM) afforded 0.7 g of polypropylene, which was separated by extraction with hexane into a soluble (80%, atactic by NMR) and an insoluble (20%, isotactic, 70% of mmmm pentads by NMR) fraction. NMR-tube polymerization tests were carried out by dissolving 0.05 mmol of (1) (runs 1 and 2) or (2) (run 3) in 0.5 ml of the proper solvent (toluened8 for run 1, tetrachloroethane-d2 for runs 2 and 3) and injecting about 10 equivalents of ethylene in the solution. Polymerizations were monitored by 1HNMR during the first minutes at 25 C (in run 3 the temperature was then raised to 60 C ), and the activities were compared following the monomer consumption.

The title cationic Cp-free zirconium hydrocarbyl has been synthesized by ligand abstraction from tetrabenzylzirconium with the strong Lewis acid tris (pentafluorophenyl)boron. NMR analysis indicates that the [Zr(CH2Ph)3]+ cation is stabilized by coordination of the phenyl ring of the anion [B(CH2Ph) (C6F5)3]−, and that this structure is maintained in aromatic solvents up to 100°C. The highly electrophilic zirconium cation reacts rapidly with Lewis bases such as THF, affording the 6-coordinate [Zr(CH2Ph)3(THF)3]+ adduct. The title compound is the first non-metallocene group 4 cationic complex which functions as a single-component olefin polymerization catalyst.
