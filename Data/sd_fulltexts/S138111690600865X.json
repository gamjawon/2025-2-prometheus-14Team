Tel.: +91 40 27193162; fax: +91 40 27160921. Graphical abstract ZrO2 is an interesting support to investigate the dispersion of vanadia and catalytic properties of V2O5–MoO3 catalysts. This paper provides influence of MoO3 on the dispersion and catalytic properties of vanadium oxide supported on ZrO2. These catalysts are found to be highly active and selective for the vapour phase ammoxidation of 3-picoline to nicotinonitrile. This investigation reports the influence of MoO3 on the dispersion of vanadium oxide on zirconia support. Samples containing various MoO3 loadings ranging from 0.5 to 4wt.% were prepared by impregnation of previously prepared 6wt.% V2O5/ZrO2 with requisite amounts of ammonium heptamolybdate solution. Dispersion of vanadia was determined by oxygen chemisorption at 640K and was found to decrease with the increase of molybdena loading. The calcined catalyst samples were characterized by specific BET surface area, XRD, FT-IR, Oxygen chemisorption and TPR of H2 techniques. The XRD results show that the intensity of tetragonal phase decreases and monoclinic phase intensity increases with the addition of MoO3 to V2O5/ZrO2 catalyst. The TPR of H2 results reveal that the reducibility of vanadia was found to decrease with the addition of molybdena to V2O5/ZrO2 catalyst. The catalytic properties were evaluated during the ammoxidation of 3-picoline to nicotinonitrile. The activity in ammoxidation reaction did not change much with the addition of molybdenum oxide. However, the selectivity of nicotinonitrile was found to increase with molybdena loading, indicates that the added molybdena created additional sites for the ammoxidation of 3-picoline reaction. The addition of molybdenum oxide inhibited the interaction between vanadium and zirconia, leading to decrease in dispersion and reducibility of vanadia. Keywords Vanadia–molybdena Zirconia Dispersion Ammoxidation 1 Introduction Vanadium oxides form a group of industrially important catalysts for the ammoxidation and partial oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons as well as for NO reduction with NH3 [1–5]. Much research activity has been devoted towards understanding the nature of active sites as well as the role played by the catalyst support. The most efficient utilization of any supported catalyst depends on the percent exposed or the dispersion of the active component on the surface of the support. The dispersion is often controlled, among other factors, by the extent of loading and the nature of the support. The active component may remain as a highly dispersed monolayer or as crystallites on the support surface, or it may even form a solid solution with the latter [6,7]. In the recent past, zirconia has been investigated as a potential catalyst support [8–11]. It is also been employed in many industrially important reactions such as hydroprocessing [8,9], oxidation of alcohols [12,13] and synthesis of methanol and higher alcohols [14,15]. The advantages of using zirconia as a catalyst support includes (i) it interacts strongly with the active phase; (ii) it possesses high thermal stability and is more chemically inert than the classical oxides; (iii) it is the only metal oxide which may possess all four chemical properties: namely acidity, basicity, reducing ability and oxidizing ability; (iv) it exhibit super-acidic properties when modified with small quantities of sulfate ions. Many aspects of vanadia catalysts like method of preparation, kinetics and mechanism of the reactions, the effect of supports, the influence of promoters and the role of the VO bond have been extensively investigated. Traditionally, oxides of several elements such as Nb, Sb, P, K, Na, Cs, Rb, Mo, and W have been used as additives to supported vanadia catalysts in order to increase their activity and to improve their selectivity for oxidation reactions [16,17]. Molybdenum is frequently added as a promoter to vanadium-based catalysts for a number of selective oxidations [18–20]. For example, V2O5 in combination with MoO3 was employed in selective oxidation of benzene to maleic anhydride and o-xylene to phthalic anhydride [21]. Dejoz et al. [22] reported the role of molybdenum in Mo doped V–Mg–O catalysts during oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane and suggested that the incorporation of MoO3 favors oxydehydrogenated products more than undoped samples. In view of the potential use of zirconia as a catalyst support and Mo as a promoter, in the present work a systematic investigation has been undertaken to investigate the dispersion and reactivity of MoO3–V2O5/ZrO2 catalysts. The influence of the presence of molybdenum oxide on the dispersion of vanadium and also on the catalytic activity during the ammoxidation of 3-picoline to nicotinonitrile has been discussed. 2 Experimental Zirconia support was prepared by ammonical hydrolysis of zirconium oxychloride (Fluka) at pH 9, followed by calcination in air at 773K for 6h. The MoO3–V2O5/ZrO2 catalysts prepared by wet impregnation method and it involves two steps. In first step, 6wt.% V2O5 supported on ZrO2 was prepared by wet impregnation of the support using an aqueous solution containing ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3). After impregnation, the sample was dried at 383K and calcined in air at 773K for 6h. In the second step a series of V2O5–MoO3/ZrO2 catalysts with varying MoO3 content ranging from 0.5 to 4wt.% prepared by wet impregnation of previously prepared and oven dried 6% V2O5/ZrO2 catalyst using stoichiometric amounts of an aqueous solution containing ammonium heptamolybdate. The samples were dried at 383K for 16h and further calcined at 773K for 6h in air. A conventional all glass high vacuum system was used to determine the surface area by nitrogen adsorption at liquid nitrogen temperature (77K). Oxygen chemisorption was measured by a static method using a Pyrex glass system capable of attaining a vacuum of 10−6 Torr. The details of the experimental set up were given elsewhere [23]. Prior to adsorption measurements the samples were pre-reduced in a flow of hydrogen (40ml/min) at 640K for 2h and evacuated at the same temperature for an hour. Oxygen chemisorption uptakes were determined as the difference of two successive adsorption isotherms measured at 640K. Fourier transform infrared spectra of the samples were recorded on Nicolet 740 FT-IR spectrometer at ambient conditions by using KBr. TPR of H2 studies of the present catalyst samples were conducted on Auto Chem 2910 (Micromeritics, USA) instrument. The unit has a programmable furnace with a maximum operating temperature of 1373K. The instrument was interfaced with a computer which performs tasks such as programmed heating and cooling cycles, continuous data recording, gas valve switching, data storage and analysis. In a typical experiment for the TPR about 250mg of oven dried sample (dried at 383K for 12h) was taken in a U-shaped quartz cell. The catalyst was packed in between two quartz wool plugs in one arm of the sample tube. The temperature was monitored with the aid of thermocouple located near the sample. The gas flows were monitored by highly sensitive mass flow controllers (Brooks). Prior to TPR studies the catalyst sample was pretreated in He flow (50ml/min) at 673K for 2h. After pretreatment the sample was cooled to ambient temperature. Now the TPR analysis was carried out in reducing mixture (50ml/min) consisting of 5% H2 and balance Ar from ambient temperature to 1273K at a heating rate of 5K/min. The reducing gas was purified by passing through oxy-trap and molecular sieves to remove oxygen and any moisture from the reducing mixture. The hydrogen concentration in the effluent stream was monitored with the thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and the H2 consumption values were calculated by calibration experiments using GRAMS/32 software. Calibration of the TCD was performed by stoichiometric reduction of a known amount of high purity Ag2O to Ag, a method, which was found to be more reliable and reproducible. A down flow fixed bed reactor operating at atmospheric pressure and made of Pyrex glass was used to test the catalytic performance of the catalysts during the ammoxidation of 3-picoline to nicotinonitrile. About 2g of the catalyst with a 18–25 mesh size diluted with an equal amount of quartz grains of the same dimensions was charged into the reactor supported on a glass wool bed. In order to minimize the adverse thermal effects, the catalyst particles were diluted to its same volume with quartz grains of similar particle size. Prior to introducing the reactant, i.e., 3-picoline with a syringe pump the catalyst was pre-reduced at 673K for 2h in purified hydrogen flow (40ml/min). After the pre-reduction, the reactor was fed with 3-picoline, ammonia and air, keeping the mole ratio of 3-picoline: H2O: NH3: air at 1:13:22:44 and contact time at 0.6s. The reaction was carried out at a temperature of 640K. The liquid products nicotinonitrile and pyridine were analyzed by the gas chromatography (HP-6890) equipped with flame ionization detector (FID) using HP-5 capillary column. 3 Discussion ZrO2 exists in three crystallographic polymorphs viz., monoclinic, tetragonal and cubic [24]. The X-ray diffraction patterns of 6wt.% V2O5/ZrO2 and various MoO3–V2O5/ZrO2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 1 . The synthesized zirconia was found to show the presence of monoclinic phase and tetragonal phases. The intense sharp reflections at d =3.16 and 2.84Å (2θ =28.2° and 31.5°) are due to the monoclinic form of zirconia and the reflections at d =2.96 and 1.83Å (2θ =30.16° and 49.8°) are due to tetragonal form of zirconia. These zirconia diffraction peaks can be seen in all the catalyst samples. A mixed vanadium and zirconium such as ZrV2O7 was formed due to the interactions between vanadia and zirconia in 6wt.% V2O5/ZrO2 catalyst (Fig. 1(a)) in addition to tetragonal and monoclinic phases of zirconia. The reflections due to ZrV2O7 can be seen at d =2.642Å (2θ =33.9°, JCPDS file no. 16-422) in all the catalyst samples. The intensity of ZrV2O7 phase was found to increase slightly with increase in molybdena loading from 0.5 to 4wt.%. The addition of MoO3 brings a dramatic reversal of intensities corresponding to the monoclinic and tetragonal reflections (Fig. 1(b)–(e)). The intensity of tetragonal zirconia phase at 2θ =30.16° is found to decrease drastically and the intensity of monoclinic zirconia phase at 2θ =31.5° is increased with molybdena loading. This might be due to the specific interactions between vanadia and zirconia. The BET specific surface areas of the MoO3–V2O5/ZrO2 catalysts are given in Table 1 . The specific surface area of pure zirconia is found to be 84m2/g. The surface area was decreased in 6wt.% V2O5/ZrO2 catalyst which is attributed to the pore blockage of the support surface by crystallites of vanadia. With the addition of molybdena the surface area did not change much at lower loadings and decreased slightly with further increase in molybdena loadings. Oxygen chemisorption measurements were performed by a static method to determine the dispersion of vanadium oxide on zirconia support. As described by Oyama et al. [25], the pre-reduction of the sample and subsequent oxygen chemisorption were carried out at 640K. Results of oxygen chemisorption by various MoO3–V2O5/ZrO2 catalysts were plotted as a function of Mo loading in Fig. 2 . Fig. 2 shows that oxygen uptake at 640K for various MoO3–V2O5/ZrO2 catalysts plotted as a function of Mo content. The amount of oxygen chemisorbed was calculated using the double isotherm method described by Parekh and Weller [26]. Pure ZrO2 support did not chemisorb oxygen under the same experimental conditions, which are employed for the Mo–V supported catalysts. The O2 uptakes along with surface area, oxygen atom site densities and dispersion values determined for various MoO3–V2O5/ZrO2 catalysts are shown in Table 1. It is clear that oxygen uptake decreases with increase of molybdena content in the catalysts. It is instructive to consider what can possibly happen to the added molybdena to the V2O5/ZrO2 monolayer catalysts. Three possibilities can be conceived: (i) part of the added molybdena can interact with hydroxyl groups on zirconia left after vanadia impregnation, because it is well known that molybdena interacts with the hydroxyl groups on zirconia [27], (ii) the molybdena may cover part of the monolayer vanadia, (iii) the molybdena might interact with vanadia to form a surface compound which is difficult to reduce. Now let us consider the influence of the above possibilities on oxygen uptake by MoO3–V2O5/ZrO2 catalysts. According to the first possibility the oxygen chemisorption should increase as it is known that the reduced molybdena on oxide support chemisorb oxygen [28]. It is experimentally found that oxygen chemisorption is decreasing with the addition of molydenum oxide on zirconia (Table 1). Therefore, the first possibility seems to be ruled out if the molybdena reduces, as does the vanadia. The second possibility predicts more or less constant oxygen chemisorption with the increase of molybdena, if the molybdena covering V2O4 units chemisorb oxygen, otherwise a decrease is visualized. The third possibility indicates a decrease in oxygen chemisorption since the surface compound formation is expected to decrease the dispersion of both the components. In reality all of the three possibilities may simultaneously occur to different extents. The decrease in oxygen chemisorption indicates that the third possibility is the most important one. However, one can not ruled out the possibility that a small fraction of molybdena interact with the hydroxyl groups of bare zirconia surface left out on the monolayer V2O5/ZrO2. Because of this phenomenon the increase in oxygen chemisorption is expected to the small. Therefore, the net decrease in oxygen chemisorption led us to believe that the third possibility predominates in MoO3–V2O5/ZrO2 catalysts. The FT-IR spectra of 6wt.% V2O5/ZrO2 and some of the MoO3–V2O5/ZrO2 catalysts are presented in Fig. 3 . The characteristic bands due to V2O5 can be seen at 1020 and 825cm−1 corresponding to VO stretching vibration and V–O–V deformation respectively [29,30]. The intensity of bands due to vanadia is found to decrease with the addition of molybdena. The characteristic bands for molybdena are at 1000 and 870cm−1 corresponding to MoO stretching vibration and Mo–O–Mo linkages [31]. The Mo–O–Mo linkage band at 870cm−1 can be seen in molybdena supported catalysts in Fig. 3(b)–(e). The broad band at ∼3400cm−1 is ascribed to surface hydroxyl groups and possibly due to ZrO(OH)2. The intensities of the bands at ∼1611 and ∼3400cm−1 have decreased with increase in molybdena loading of the catalysts. Bond et al. [32] have attributed these bands to the deformation vibrations of adsorbed water and surface OH groups of the support. The decrease in the intensity of hydroxyl groups at 3400cm−1 might be due to the interactions between added molybdena hydroxyl groups present on the surface of the support. The temperature-programmed reduction profile of unsupported V2O5 is shown in Fig. 4 . The profile shows multiple major reduction peaks at 965, 1003, and 1067K when treated in 5% H2-in-Ar up to 1273K. Koranne et al. [33] and Bosch et al. [34] have reported a similar observation, and they have attributed this phenomenon to the following reduction sequence: (1) V2O5 →V6O13 (2) V6O13 →V2O4 (3) V2O4 →V2O3 The sharp peak at 965K corresponds to the reduction of V2O5 to V6O13 (first peak), the peak at 1003K is associated with the reduction of V6O13 to V2O4 (second step), and the peak at 1067K corresponds to V2O3 formed by the reduction of V2O4. The TPR profile of unsupported MoO3 has been presented in Fig. 5 and it shows two major peaks at 1040, 1270K and one minor peak at 1070K. According to Thomas et al. [35] and Arnoldy et al. [36], the reduction of molybdena essentially can take place in two steps. The following steps present in the reducibility of MoO3: MoO3 →MoO2 MoO2 →Mo The sharp peak at 1040K corresponds to the reduction of MoO3 (first step) and the peak at 1270K is associated with the reduction of the second step. A minor peak at the edge of the first peak is observed at 1070K, which corresponds to Mo4O11 formed by reduction of MoO3. Thomas [37] also noticed this peak during TPR of MoO3 and confirmed it by in situ XRD: MoO3 →Mo4O11 Temperature-programmed reduction profiles of V2O5/ZrO2 and MoO3–V2O5/ZrO2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 6 . The dependence of T max values on the MoO3 content are shown in Table 2 . The TPR of V2O5/ZrO2 show a single peak with T max at 751K, which is attributed to the reduction of V4+. These results are in agreement with the results of Koranne et al. [33], where in they found a single major reduction peak above 773K in the TPR of V2O5/Al2O3. The results of TPR of various MoO3–V2O5/ZrO2 catalysts show a systematic change in the reduction of vanadia with the increase of molybdena promoter. The TPR profiles for all samples have shown two prominent maxima (T max) and their position are listed in Table 2. The low temperature peak in the region of 790K is due to the reduction of V5+ to V4+. The T max increased with the addition of molybdenum oxide and it is higher than that of V2O5/ZrO2 (Table 2). The reduction temperature shifted to higher values (751–795K) as the molybdena loading was increased from 0.5 to 4wt.%, suggesting an increase in particle size of microcrystalline vanadia. This shows the decrease in the dispersion of vanadia on zirconia support and which is also evidenced from oxygen chemisorption measurements. The second major peak appeared above 1190K in all MoO3–V2O5/ZrO2 catalysts is due to the reduction of MoO3. The intensity of second peak due to molybdena reduction can be clearly seen with increase in molybdena loading (Fig. 6). The TPR results of MoO3–V2O5/ZrO2 catalysts are in agreement with the H2-TPR work of Casagrande et al. [38]. The dependence of MoO3 loading on V2O5/ZrO2 catalysts on the conversion and selectivity during the ammoxidation of 3-picoline is shown in Fig. 7 . The conversion of 3-picoline was found to be independent of molybdena content in the V2O5/ZrO2 catalyst. The conversion did not change much with molybdena addition as a promoter. However, the selectivity of nicotinonitrile formation was found to be increase with increase in molybdena loading. The increase of nicotinonitrile selectivity with MoO3 content might be due to the promotion by Mo species. Our earlier reports [19] also investigate similar activity results on MoO3–V2O5/Al2O3 catalysts during the partial oxidation of methanol. The formaldehyde selectivity was found to increase with MoO3 content on V2O5/Al2O3 system. Molybdenum containing catalysts display a high selectivity in various oxidation reactions: lattice oxide ions are the key reaction participants at temperatures >600K, while gaseous oxygen reoxidizes the catalysts [39–41]. Since Mars and Van Krevelen [42] first suggested the important role of lattice oxide ions in the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons over metal-oxide catalysts, many studies have been made in this field. The oxide ions resulting from chemisorption and dissociation of the gaseous oxygen on the catalyst surface diffuse through the bulk of the catalyst to the active site at which adsorption and oxidation of the hydrocarbon occur. The following points are elucidated for the surface active sites of V2O5 catalysts by the effect of MoO3 as a promoter [43]: (i) the surface concentration of redox sites is increased by addition of MoO3 to V2O5 catalysts. The surface VO species are newly formed on the various crystal planes of solid solution under the surface MoO species on the intermediate compounds are activated under the effect of V2O5 to act as the redox sites. (ii) The acid sites of V2O5 catalysts are not modified significantly by the addition of MoO3. The high activity of V2O5–MoO3 catalysts reported in the literature may be attributed to the increase in the surface concentration of the VO species on solid solution. 4 Conclusions The effect of molybdenum oxide promoter on 6wt.% V2O5/ZrO2 catalyst is quite significant during the ammoxidation of 3-picoline. The dispersion of vanadia was found to decrease with the addition of molybdena. The oxygen chemisorption results further support the reducibility of catalysts by TPR. XRD results showed the phase transfer changes with the addition of molybdena and which might be due to the specific interactions between vanadia and zirconia support. The catalytic activity during the ammoxidation of 3-picoline reaction does not change much with the addition of molybdena as a promoter. However, it favors the selectivity improvement of nicotinonitrile during ammoxidation. References [1] G.C. Bond S. Flamerz Tahir Appl. Catal. 71 1 1991 and references therein [2] F. Cavani F.

Samples containing various MoO3 loadings ranging from 0.5 to 4wt.% were prepared by impregnation of previously prepared 6wt.% V2O5/ZrO2 with requisite amounts of ammonium heptamolybdate solution. Dispersion of vanadia was determined by oxygen chemisorption at 640K and was found to decrease with the increase of molybdena loading. The calcined catalyst samples were characterized by specific BET surface area, XRD, FT-IR, Oxygen chemisorption and TPR of H2 techniques. The XRD results show that the intensity of tetragonal phase decreases and monoclinic phase intensity increases with the addition of MoO3 to V2O5/ZrO2 catalyst. The TPR of H2 results reveal that the reducibility of vanadia was found to decrease with the addition of molybdena to V2O5/ZrO2 catalyst. The catalytic properties were evaluated during the ammoxidation of 3-picoline to nicotinonitrile. The activity in ammoxidation reaction did not change much with the addition of molybdenum oxide. However, the selectivity of nicotinonitrile was found to increase with molybdena loading, indicates that the added molybdena created additional sites for the ammoxidation of 3-picoline reaction. The addition of molybdenum oxide inhibited the interaction between vanadium and zirconia, leading to decrease in dispersion and reducibility of vanadia.",
