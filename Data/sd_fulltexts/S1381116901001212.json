Investigation of the physico-chemical state and aggregation mechanism of surface Cr species on a Phillips CrO x /SiO2 catalyst by XPS and EPMA Boping Liu Minoru Terano * School of Materials Science, Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, 1-1 Asahidai, Tatsunokuchi, Ishikawa 923-1292, Japan * Corresponding author. Tel.: +81-761-51-1620; fax: +81-761-51-1625 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) were jointly applied to achieve some basic understandings of the physico-chemical state and aggregation mechanism of surface Cr species on an industrial Phillips CrO x /SiO2 catalyst calcined in dry air at 800°C for 20h with 0.4 Cr/nm2. The XPS results showed the coexistence of surface-stabilized hexavalent chromate species (70.4% expressed as Cr(VI)O x,surf) and trivalent chromium oxide (29.6%) on the catalyst. The latter derived from calcination-induced reduction of the Cr(VI)O x,surf species is mostly chemically-bonded to the silica surface (expressed as Cr(III)O x,surf). The EPMA map and line curves of the Cr distribution state on the catalyst revealed a small amount of the trivalent chromium oxide existed as a few aggregates in sizes of 200–300nm on the surface of each particle, which were supposed to be crystallized aggregates of Cr2O3. Consequently, the calcination-induced reduction of Cr(VI)O x,surf to Cr(III)O x,surf species and the formation of Cr2O3 microcrystals on the Phillips catalyst with relatively low Cr loading were specifically confirmed. The variation of distribution and oxidation states of surface Cr species for the catalyst after being further calcined at 800°C for 2h in the presence of moisture had also been studied in terms of the role of moisture and effect of atmosphere (pure air or N2). It was found that the purposely introduced moisture induced the transformation of all the Cr(III)O x,surf and one-seventh of Cr(VI)O x,surf species into aggregates of Cr2O3 at high temperature, whereas oxidizing and inert atmospheres made no obvious difference. Finally, the formation mechanism of aggregates of Cr2O3 induced by moisture through cleavage of Cr(III)O x,surf species during the calcination had been speculated considering of the indispensable evolution of traces of moisture from the simultaneous dehydroxylation of residual hydroxyl groups on silica surface. The advantages of the combination of XPS and EPMA techniques for the basic investigation of Phillips catalysts were substantiated by the results obtained in this study. Keywords Phillips CrO x /SiO2 catalyst Surface Cr species Aggregation Electron probe microanalysis X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 1 Introduction As one of the most important members in the family of commercial polyolefin catalysts, Phillips catalyst is still responsible for several million tons of commercial production of polyolefins including HDPE and LLDPE, etc. In spite of more than 40 years of research efforts, since its discovery by Hogan and Banks in the early 1950s, many aspects concerning the physico-chemical state of the surface Cr species as well as the polymerization mechanism still remain controversial [1–9]. The phsico-chemical state of surface Cr species, which is closely related to the molecular structure, texture and orientation of the chromium oxide on the catalyst surface, seems playing crucial roles for a deeper understanding of the Phillips catalyst [1–4,9]. In the literature, many different methods, such as oxygen chemisorption [10–12], magnetic susceptibility measurement [13,14], XRD [15–18], EPR [14,19,20], SIMS [21], Raman [17,22–24], UV–VIS DRS [14,19,22], EXAFS-XANES [25], PIXE [26], TPR [8,18,19], SEM/EDS [27], IR [8,28] and XPS [8,17,26,29–42], etc. had been used separately or jointly to characterize the physico-chemical state of Cr species on Phillips catalysts. It was generally accepted that the bulk CrO3 could be highly dispersed and stabilized as surface chromate species (i.e. monochromate and dichromate, sometimes even polychromate) through the reaction with the surface groups on silica gel during the calcination process at 300–900°C in oxygen or dry air [4,15,32,43]. Usually, a highly dispersed state of surface-stabilized chromate species can be achieved through many redispersion cycles of sublimation, volatilization, spreading, deposition and stabilization of bulk CrO3 (mp 196°C and bp 250°C) on the support surface during the calcination [4,5]. Whereas there are two frequently reported unfavorable phenomena occurred during the calcination process: the calcination-induced reduction of surface-stabilized hexavalent chromate species into lower valent state (+5, +4 or +3) [10–14,19,26,32,44–46] and the creation of aggregated Cr2O3 (usually in crystallized form) [4,15,18,23,31,43,47], although an oxidizing atmosphere (O2 or dry air) is utilized. These affect in a great extent the physico-chemical state of the surface Cr species, thus the properties and performance of the catalyst. Especially the formation of Cr2O3 crystallites (mp 2435°C and bp 4000°C), which was highly stable and thought to deactivate the catalyst for ethylene polymerization, may occur at any stage of the catalyst preparation: calcination, reduction and activation, or even during the polymerization process [4,18,19,20]. As a result, the supported Cr species may be present on the silica surface in a mixture of different valence, coordination and distribution states, depending on the preparation conditions [26–31,34,35]. For a catalyst in calcined form, the main factors which affect the calcination-induced reduction and the appearance of the undesirable aggregated Cr2O3 include the Cr loading, calcination temperature, calcination duration, type of support, gas media, etc. Furthermore, there is a limitation of the dispersion and stabilization of chromium oxide on support surface, i.e. saturation coverage, which is proportional to the surface hydroxyl density, surface area of the support and inversely proportional to the calcination temperature [4,15,43]. When the content of the CrO3 exceeds the saturation coverage under a given condition, the excess of CrO3 decomposes into aggregated Cr2O3 on the support surface during calcination [4,15,23,31,43,47]. In this work, our interests will be mainly focused on the following two unclear questions concerning the physico-chemical state of surface Cr species on a calcined Phillips CrO x /SiO2 catalyst with relatively low Cr loading ca. 0.4 Cr/nm2 (i.e. 1wt.% Cr for silica with 280m2/g, much lower than the saturation coverage for silica [15,43]), where the Cr loading of an industrial catalyst usually locates. The first ambiguous question is, weather the formation of aggregated Cr2O3 occurs or not even under this relatively low Cr loading. It is usually beyond the sensitivity limitation of the measurement for detecting the occurrence of aggregates under this low Cr loading by most of the conventional spectroscopy methods [8]. Therefore, Some disputes concerning this topic are still in existence due to the lack of direct and conclusive evidences. For example, Ellison and coworkers [21,25] found that clustering of Cr species even occurred on CrO x /SiO2 catalysts (525–600°C in air, 350m2/g) with 1wt.% Cr from SIMS as well as EXAFS-XANES characterization. According to the report of Cimino et al. [29], when a Phillips CrO x /SiO2 catalyst (300–700°C in air for 5h, 210m2/g) with 1wt.% Cr was calcined over 600°C the formation of agglomerated Cr2O3 was detectable by XRD method. Whereas Zaki et al. [22] reported that the α-Cr2O3 detection on Phillips CrO x /SiO2 catalysts (300–600°C in air for 5h, 210m2/g) was beyond the sensitivity of the XRD technique when the Cr loading was lower than 3wt.%. Recent results of Wang and Murata [16] who used a CrO x /SiO2 catalyst (700°C in air for 3h) indicated that the XRD method was unable to detect the formation of Cr2O3 when the Cr loading was below 2wt.%, while the Cr2O3 aggregates most probably already existed as they suggested. On the other hand, some Raman studies by Wachs and coworkers [23,48–50] on calcined Phillips CrO x /SiO2 catalysts (500°C for 16h or 700°C for 2h, 300m2/g) with Cr loading from 0.1 to 2wt.% did not show the presence of crystalline Cr2O3. McDaniel [15] studied the calcination mechanism of CrO x /SiO2 catalysts (200–800°C in air for 18h, Davison 952/280m2/g) with 1.5 or 3wt.% Cr and found that only Cr6+ was found up to 600°C, but at 800°C some decomposition of hexavalent Cr to lower valence states was noticed, particularly at 3wt.%, XRD indicated the formation of Cr2O3 crystallites in diameter of 40nm. Bensalem and Weckhuysen et al. [20] confirmed the absence of Cr2O3 clusters for a CrO x /silica (400°C in O2 for 2h, 800m2/g) catalyst with 0.5wt.% Cr by EPR. Jóźwiak and Lana [18] even reported that ground crystalline α-Cr2O3 could be completely oxidized, dispersed and stabilized as chromate species on silica (165m2/g) at low Cr loading ca.0.5wt.% after calcination in O2 or dry air up to 700°C from their XRD and TPR evidence. Some researchers only supposed the possibility of creating Cr2O3 microcrystals in a separate reduction step on a CO [20,27,51] or H2 [19] reduced Phillips catalyst with relatively low Cr loading. The discrepancy mentioned above may be derived from the diversity of the catalyst preparation conditions and the difference in sensitivity of the analytical methods. Supposing the clustering and formation of aggregated Cr2O3 could be confirmed on a Phillips CrO x /SiO2 catalyst with relatively low Cr loading ca.0.4 Cr/nm2, the second confusing question would be what is the origin and formation mechanism of this aggregated Cr2O3. Previously, the formation of aggregated Cr2O3 is usually thought to be related with the thermal decomposition (or reduction) of bulk CrO3 [4,15,18,23,31,43,47], but this seems unreasonable when the Cr loading is much lower than the saturation coverage. It is also supposed to be significantly affected by the presence of moisture [14,18,29,43,47] and O2 concentration [43] in the calcination gas media. Nevertheless, the specific mechanism has seldom been dealt with before. Especially the relationship and difference between the calcination-induced reduction of surface chromate species and the thermal decomposition (or reduction) of bulk CrO3 has never been discussed, in which the former may also play some roles in formation of aggregated Cr2O3. Bearing these questions in mind, the surface analytical methods XPS and EPMA, which can obtain the substantial information of the oxidation and distribution states of surface Cr species, are considered for characterization of the catalyst implemented in this work. In our previous research, a better understanding of the oxidation and distribution states on several titanium-based Ziegler–Natta polyolefin catalysts had been achieved by XPS [52–55] and SAM [55–57] methods. The XPS is also a powerful method for measuring the oxidation state of Cr on Phillips catalysts [8,17,26,29,30–42]. The binding energy (BE) of the Cr 2p level is frequently used as a criterion for identifying the oxidation state of the surface Cr species. On the other hand, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) value of the Cr 2p spectrum is a reflection of the distribution state of the Cr species in its corresponding oxidation state, which also give valuable information especially for discriminating aggregated Cr2O3 from surface-stabilized and highly dispersed Cr species. Both qualitative and quantitative information of surface Cr species in mixed oxidation states can be obtained by XPS method [26,28–31,34,35,42]. Two surface analytical methods PIXE and SEM/EDS has been used to directly map the distribution state of surface Cr species on Phillips catalysts before by Rahman et al. [26] and Schmidt et al. [27], respectively, but they just got the Cr images at relatively low resolution from different catalysts(CrO x /Al2O3 and CO-reduced CrO x /SiO2, respectively) at relatively high Cr loading (4.4–5wt.%). The SAM is also not practical for mapping the distribution state of Cr due to too small difference of the Auger electron peak energy between Cr (525eV) and O (503eV). The EPMA method with high resolution makes it possible to directly map the distribution state of the Cr species on a Phillips catalyst with relatively low Cr loading. In general, our approach is based on the XPS technique combined with EPMA measurements for study of the physico-chemical state and formation mechanism of aggregated Cr2O3 on an industrial Phillips CrO x /SiO2 catalyst with 0.4 Cr/nm2 of Cr loading. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst and treatments Nitrogen (B-grade, impurity <5ppm) and pure air (S-grade, impurity <1ppm) purchased from Uno Sanso Co., were used directly without further purification. Commercial bulk CrO3 and Cr2O3 were bought from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., and Kanto Chemical Co., Inc., respectively. A Phillips CrO x /SiO2 catalyst (S-1) was donated by Japan Polyolefin Co., Ltd., which was prepared from impregnation of Davison 952 silica gel (BET surface area ca. 280m2/g) with aqueous solution of CrO3 followed by calcination in dry air up to 800°C for 20h. The catalyst was stored in small glass ampoule bottles sealed under nitrogen atmosphere before use. The chromium content of the catalysts was ca. 1wt.% (i.e. 0.4 Cr/nm2). The ethylene polymerization activity of this catalyst was confirmed to be similar with that in its commercial production line. Other two samples (S-2 and S-3) were prepared from treatments of the catalyst (S-1) at 800°C for 2h in moisture-contained pure air flow (S-2) and moisture-contained N2 flow (S-3), respectively, in a quartz microreactor. The pure air or nitrogen flow was bubbling through a glass vessel filled with pure water before entering into the microreactor. 2.2 Sample characterization 2.2.1 The XPS instrumentation The XPS data were obtained on a Physical Electronics Perkin-Elmer Model Phi-5600 ESCA spectrometer with monochromated Al Kα radiation (1486.6eV) operated at 300W. Each sample was embedded on a conductive copper tape to form a sample disc in a diameter of 5mm and fixed on a sample holder. The sample holder was then put into the vacuum transfer vessel (Phi Model 04-110, Perkin-Elmer Co., Ltd.), which can be connected to the sample introduction chamber on the XPS instrument for sample transfer without atmospheric exposure. The above procedures were carried out in a glove bag, which had been purged overnight with nitrogen gas in advance. The prepared sample was degassed in the introduction chamber to 10−7 Torr before entering the main chamber, in which the vacuum was kept above 5×10−9 Torr during XPS data acquisitions. A neutralizer was used to reduce the charging effect to obtain a better signal to noise ratio. The difficulty in XPS study of a Phillips catalyst is to minimize the X-ray induced reduction during the XPS measurements. The X-ray induced reduction during XPS acquisition was found to be significantly dependant on the preparation conditions of the catalyst. The partially thermal-reduced catalyst implemented in this study was found to be only slightly affected by the X-ray irradiation during the XPS measurement within 2h. This agrees well with the report of Best et al. who also investigated a partially thermal-reduced Phillips catalyst using a monochromated X-ray source [31]. All XPS spectra for oxidation state determination of Cr were obtained within 2h (if not specified) with only negligible X-ray induced reduction to the surface Cr species. All binding energies were referenced to the Si 2p peak of silica gel at 103.3eV to correct for the charging effect during acquisition [38]. Another challenging problem confronted is a precise multiplet fitting of the Cr 2p level in a mixed oxidation states. To pursue this, the bulk CrO3 and Cr2O3 were also measured together with some literature data for Phillips catalysts in single “pure” oxidation state [32] as references for XPS data analysis. Multiplet fittings of the Cr 2p XPS curves by the Gaussian–Lorentzian method were carried out to determine the mixed states of valences in all the samples. The fitting for each curve was repeated for several times to ensure a reproducible result. 2.2.2 EPMA measurements The EPMA measurements were carried out on a JEOL JXA-8900L system. At first, the door of the sample transfer chamber was covered with a glove bag, in which nitrogen was purged overnight to remove impurities including traces of moisture and oxygen. A double spreading carbon tape specially made for electron microscopy by Japan Oken Co., Ltd., was used as a conducting substrate to fix the catalyst sample. Each catalyst sample was embedded on the carbon tape and fixed on the sample holder in the glove bag under nitrogen atmosphere. Finally, the sample holder was put into the sample transfer chamber, by which the sample could be introduced into the measuring chamber without atmospheric exposure. The vacuum in the EPMA main chamber was typically under 1×10−5 Torr. The EPMA was used with an accelerating voltage of 20kV, a probe current of 2×10−8 A and a probe electron beam diameter of 1μm. Dispersive crystal of TETJ was used for wavelength dispersive X-ray analysis (WDX). Both map and line analyses of Cr were carried out for characterization of the distribution state of Cr species on the catalyst surface. The surface roughness of the catalyst particle would slightly affect the relative intensity of the Cr signal (the convex surface leading to slightly higher Cr intensity) without changing the main characteristic of the Cr distribution state. For characterization of each catalyst sample, the distribution states of Cr on many different catalyst particles of the same sample were carefully observed to get the most typical and reproducible results. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 The oxidation and distribution states of Cr on the Phillips catalyst As a fundamental aspect for making a precise and proper prediction of the oxidation state of surface Cr species on the supported catalyst, some XPS measurements were carried out on pure chromium oxides to obtain Cr 2p spectra (shown in Fig. 1 ) in mixture with small amount of silica as reference. The Cr 2p region of silica without Cr supporting (not shown) was also measured, which facilitated the base line determination for the Cr 2p spectra during fitting treatment [38]. The BE and FWHM values from Cr 2p(3/2) level of bulk CrO3 and Cr2O3 were listed in Table 1 together with a comparison with those from [29,30,32,41]. As it can be seen, the deviation of BE values from Cr 2p(3/2) level of bulk chromium oxides in Table 1 mainly generated from the reference peak for charging effect correction for different researchers. For example, Cimino et al. [29] used the value of 283.8eV of the C 1s level resulting from the contaminated carbon as reference, whereas Okamoto et al. [30] took the same C 1s reference at 1.2eV higher (i.e. 285.0eV) for correction. This can explain why the former got the lower BE value. Our results of Cr 2p(3/2) level for CrO3 (BE: 579.24eV, FWHM: 2.53eV) and Cr2O3 (BE: 576.59eV, FWHM: 3.03eV) seem reasonable and very near to the average values in Table 1 after correction using the same reference of Au 4f(7/2)=84eV or C 1s=285eV. From Table 1 and Fig. 1, one can find the most pronounced feature of Cr 2p peak for bulk chromium oxides compared with the supported Cr-based catalyst is the small FWHM values, so to speak the sharp peak morphology, which will be utilized as an important reference for discriminating aggregated Cr2O3 from surface-stabilized and highly dispersed Cr species in the later discussion. Fig. 1 also showed the XPS spectra of Cr 2p level for the industrial Phillips CrO x /SiO2 catalyst (S-1) in calcined form. A single doublet fitting for this spectrum was found to be impossible for getting a perfect curve fitting, which indicated that a mixed oxidation states existed in this catalyst. This also means the Phillips catalyst (S-1) had suffered calcination-induced reduction and/or thermal decomposition during the thermal-treatment at 800°C for 20h in its preparation process leading to the formation of some surface Cr species in a lower oxidation state. A multiplet fitting was applied and its corresponding BE and FWHM values of Cr 2p(3/2) level was tabulated in Table 2 . Two oxidation states were found in this catalyst namely the first with a BE of 581.81eV and a FWHM of 9.62eV assigned as an oxidation state of +6 (atomic concentration 70.4%) and the second with a BE of 577.21eV and a FWHM of 4.43eV assigned as an oxidation state of +3 (atomic concentration 29.6%). Accordingly, almost one thirds of the hexavalent Cr species was subject to calcination-induced reduction (from chromate species) and/or thermal decomposition (from bulk CrO3) during calcination. The next important aspect is to determine the real physico-chemical state of this two kinds of Cr species in oxidation states of +6 and +3, respectively, on the silica surface: chemically stabilized or in bulk phase? The BE value of 581.81eV for the surface Cr species in an oxidation of +6 on the calcined catalyst is 2.57eV higher than that of 579.24eV for the bulk CrO3. The shifting in Cr 2p(3/2) BE demonstrated that this surface Cr is surface-stabilized chromate species (including monochromate, dichromate and sometimes even polychromate expressed as Cr(VI)O x,surf). Such an increase in BE is acceptable when the Cr species becomes isolated on the silica gel with weak acidity, since the electron extracting effect from the oxygen atoms on silica gel is stronger than it would be in the CrO3 lattice [32]. This effect could be further strengthened by the increasing strain in the surface siloxane groups due to the successive dehydroxylation upon calcination [4,15]. This is favorably supported by the experimental evidence reported by Thüne et al. [38] and Merryfield et al. [32]. The former got a BE of 581.3eV (reference: Si 2p=103.3eV) for a model Cr(VI)O x /SiO2/Si(100) catalyst with 1 Cr/nm2 calcined in He/O2 at 450°C within 1h. The latter obtained BE values (reference: Si 2p=103.5eV) of 581.6eV (FWHM=3.7eV) and 581.7eV for Cr(VI)O x /SiO2 catalysts with 0.4 Cr/nm2 and 1.2 Cr/nm2, respectively, prepared upon calcination in dry air at 650°C for 1h. The lower calcination temperature and much shorter calcination time account for their no occurrence of calcination-induced reduction and/or thermal decomposition resulting in catalysts in “pure” Cr oxidation state of +6. In our case, the higher calcination temperature and much longer calcination time most probably contributed to the formation of more polymerized chromate species in different polydispersities as well as the occurrence of calcination-induced reduction and/or thermal decomposition. The former was reflected from the FWHM value of 9.62eV indicating much more heterogeneous physico-chemical state of our surface chromate species including the effect from its local environment of mixed oxidation states. The calcination mechanism of CrO x /SiO2 catalysts (200–800°C in air for 18h) with 0.6 or 1.2 Cr/nm2 was studied by McDaniel [15]. The molar ratio of reacted OH and Cr was found to decrease from two to even below one with increasing temperature, so he suggested that monochromate was initially formed followed with some possible secondary formation of dichromate or even polychromate in the later stage of calcination. The coexistence of polychromate with monochromate and dichromate species on calcined Phillips CrO x /SiO2 catalysts had also been frequently reported by other researchers [14,19,22,23]. The specific molecular structures of the anchored chromate species (Cr(VI)O x,surf) are not elucidated yet, and Fig. 2 just illustrates its plausible structures on the silica surface postulated in the literature [14,15,19,22,23]. Best et al. [31] got results of much lower Cr 2p(3/2) BE (579.9eV) ascribed to the chromate species on CrO x /SiO2 catalysts (300–400°C in air for 4h, silica: Cab-O-Sil grade M-5) with high Cr loading 8wt.%. The most probable explanation is that they abtained measurements on a mixture of chromate species and bulk CrO3 rather than chromate species solely, since their Cr loading was far above the saturation coverage [4,15,32,43]. As for the surface Cr species in an oxidation of +3 on this calcined catalyst, its BE value of 577.21eV and FWHM value of 4.43eV seem quite different from the typical values of the bulk Cr2O3. Especially the latter strongly suggests its surface-stabilized and highly dispersed characteristics, i.e. trivalent Cr species chemically bonded to silica surface (Cr(III)O x,surf). This assignment is firmly supported by the work of McDaniel et al. [32], who prepared a standard surface-stabilized Cr(III)O x /SiO2 sample (from 300°C calcination of Cr(III) acetate on silica in wet N2) with a BE value of 577.6eV and a FWHM value of 4.9eV for the Cr 2p(3/2) level. Compared with bulk Cr2O3, the higher BE of Cr(III)O x,surf species might be resulted from the stabilizing effect of the silica as well as the environmental effect of neighboring chromate species, and the larger FWHM value could be ascribed to its variety in molecule structure and the heterogeneity of the silica surface. The appearance of surface-stabilized Cr(III)O x,surf species on Phillips catalysts had been frequently reported by other researchers [10–14,19,26,32,44–46]. Although its specific molecular structure is still remained ambiguous, four plausible structure models (illustrated in Fig. 3 ) had been proposed before [14,44–46]. The formation of this Cr(III)O x,surf species was thought to originate from calcination-induced reduction of the chromate Cr(VI)O x,surf species and to increase with calcination temperature and time. This calcination-induced reduction is reasonable judging from the variation of state of the chromate Cr(VI)O x,surf species in the calcination process. As the calcination proceeds at high temperature, i.e. 800°C, the strain in the surface SiO bonds developed by the successive dehydroxylation of hydroxyl groups, will become more and more dominant in affecting the chemical stability of the chromate species. Lower Cr loading means more hydroxyl groups are removed by dehydroxylation rather than by reaction with CrO3 so as to create much stronger strain in the surface SiO bonds. The shifting of the BE to higher value for the chromate Cr(VI)O x,surf species resulted from surface-stabilization effect and successive increasing strain in the surface siloxane group during calcination implies a decreasing electron density, i.e. an increasing reduction-potential. It can be expected that the calcination-induced reduction of the chromate Cr(VI)O x,surf to Cr(III)O x,surf species occurs at certain critical point depending on specific conditions including temperature, duration, etc. Jóźwiak and Lana [18] depicted such an image that the chromate Cr(VI)O x,surf species could suffer calcination-induced reduction through an oxygen desorption process originating from its terminal CrO bonds and subsequently change into Cr(II)O x,surf species at 800°C in a neutral atmosphere. In our case, surface Cr(III)O x,surf species would be expected due to the much higher stability of Cr(III)O x,surf species than the Cr(II)O x,surf species in O2-contained atmosphere [46]. One thing worth notice is the slightly lower BE and FWHM values of the Cr 2p(3/2) level for the Cr(III)O x,surf species on our catalyst compared with that of the standard Cr(III)O x /SiO2 sample by McDaniel et al. [32], which suggest the existence of a small amount of bulk Cr2O3 can not be completely excluded. Fig. 4 shows the typical results of EPMA map and line curves of the Cr distribution on the calcined catalyst. As it can be seen, the Cr species mostly dispersed uniformly on the surface of each catalyst particle. This strongly support the above assignments to the surface Cr species on our catalyst namely the surface-stabilized, highly dispersed Cr(VI)O x,surf and Cr(III)O x,surf species. Whereas the heterogeneity of Cr distribution on each individual catalyst particle was also revealed in all the EPMA images measured on this catalyst, that is the existence of a few of local aggregates of Cr species in sizes of 200–300nm on the surface of the catalyst. These aggregates corresponding to the red patches (marked in circles) in the map image and sharp peak in the line curves in Fig. 4(a) and (b), respectively, were supposed to be microcrystal particles of Cr2O3. With the aid of the combined techniques of XPS and EPMA, a clear image of the surface physico-chemical state on an industrial Phillips catalyst in calcined form is obtained, that is the existence of three kinds of surface Cr species on our catalyst namely the Cr(VI)O x,surf chromate (ca. 70%) and Cr(III)O x,surf species (ca. 29%) and small amount of Cr2O3 microcrystals. Consequently, the calcination-induced reduction of Cr(VI)O x,surf to Cr(III)O x,surf species and the formation of aggregated Cr2O3 in a calcined Phillips catalyst with even relatively low Cr loading, i.e. 0.4 Cr/nm2 were specifically confirmed. The second unavoidable question is what is the origin and formation mechanism of this aggregated Cr2O3, which cannot be simply explained by the “calcination-induced reduction” and/or “thermal decomposition”. A detailed understanding of the origin and formation mechanism of the aggregated Cr2O3 is in great demand as for a state-of-art designing of this important industrial catalyst. 3.2 The oxidation and distribution states of Cr on the thermal-treated samples According to previous reports [14,26,29,42], the formation of aggregated Cr2O3 on catalysts with low level Cr loading usually occurs in the later stage of calcination behind the full stabilization of bulk CrO3 as chromate species and a consequent calcination-induced reduction into Cr(III)O x,surf species. It is also supposed that the formation of aggregated Cr2O3 is significantly affected by the presence of moisture [14,18,29,43,47] and O2 concentration [43] in the calcination gas media. In connection with the image of the surface physico-chemical state on our Phillips catalyst described in the previous section, two possible routes shown in Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively, should be taken into prior consideration for creation of aggregated Cr2O3 considering of the inevitable evolution of traces of moisture from the simultaneous dehydroxylation of residual hydroxyl groups (1) Cr(VI)O x, surf +H 2 O(g) ⇄ dryair 800°C CrO 3 → dryair 800°C Cr 2 O 3+O 2 (2) Cr(III)O x, surf +H 2 O(g) → dryair 800°C Cr 2 O 3 on silica surface during the calcination process. The first route shown in Eq. (1) is a two-step process: at first, the chromate Cr(VI)O x,surf species is cleft by traces of moisture leading to the formation of CrO3, and then the CrO3 decomposes into Cr2O3. In this route, the first step is a reversible reaction and mainly goes to the Cr(VI)O x,surf side especially at low Cr loading and high temperature. This is supported by a mechanism proposed by Groeneveld et al. [14], Jóźwiak and Lana [18] that is traces of water vapor acts as a “promoter” for the stabilization of bulk chromium trioxide on the silica surface during the calcination process at high temperature as shown in Eqs. (3) and (4). The direct (3) CrO 3+H 2 O(g)→CrO 2(OH)2 (4) CrO 2(OH)2+SiOH surf →Cr(VI)O x, surf +H 2 O(g) (5) CrO 3+SiOSi surf →Cr(VI)O x, surf incorporation of bulk CrO3 into the surface siloxane groups formed from dehydroxylation (shown in Eq. (5)) resulting in Cr(VI)O x,surf species at high temperature is also possible according to the reports by McDaniel et al. [15], Jóźwiak and Lana [18]. So even if some Cr(VI)O x,surf species is occasionally cleft by traces of moisture leading to the formation of CrO3, the later could be quickly re-anchored on the silica surface through the reaction with the neighboring hydroxyl or siloxane groups. Moreover, it is well known that the second step of the redox reaction (thermal decomposition of bulk CrO3) can be efficiently suppressed by the presence of O2 or dry air during calcination [4,43]. The occasional cleavage of Cr(VI)O x,surf species by traces of moisture is suggested to facilitate the migration and redispersion of Cr(VI)O x,surf species on the silica surface by Jóźwiak and Lana [18]. In the second route shown in Eq. (2), the supported Cr(III)O x,surf species is cleft by traces of moisture directly resulting in the formation of Cr2O3, which sounds more feasible due to its much less reversibility as well as no effect from the gas media(oxidizing or not) compared with the first route. In order to elucidate the origin and formation mechanism of the aggregated Cr2O3, the role of moisture in the formation of aggregated Cr2O3 during the calcination treatment of the Phillips catalyst is investigated in terms of calcination atmosphere (pure air or N2). For getting more pronounced information, which would facilitate our judgement, extra moisture was purposely introduced into the gas media during the further calcination treatment of our catalyst sample. Substantially, the Phillips catalyst (S-1) in calcined form (800°C in dry air for 20h) was further thermal-treated at 800°C for 2h in moisture-contained pure air (S-2) and moisture-contained nitrogen (S-3) flow, respectively, before XPS and EPMA measurements. Different effects from oxidizing and non-oxidizing atmosphere during calcination shown in the first route (Eq. (1)) and the second route (Eq. (2)) could be expected and utilized to elucidate which route is in function. The XPS spectra of Cr 2p level of S-2 and S-3 are shown in Fig. 1. The corresponding BE and FWHM values of Cr 2p(3/2) level obtained by multiplet fittings are listed in Table 2 together with those of S-1. For sample S-2 treated in moisture-contained pure air flow, two oxidation states were found namely the first with a BE of 581.64eV and a FWHM of 8.30eV assigned as an oxidation state of +6 (atomic concentration 59.4%) and the second with a BE of 577.58eV and a FWHM of 3.28eV assigned as an oxidation state of +3 (atomic concentration 40.6%). The first can be ascribed to Cr(VI)O x,surf species based on previous discussion. About one-seventh of chromate Cr(VI)O x,surf species (i.e. ca. 10% of all surface Cr) in S-1 was reduced to the second Cr species in oxidation state of +3 after the treatment. The slightly decreased BE value of the Cr(VI)O x,surf species after treatment may be an indication of the preferential reduction of some specific Cr(VI)O x,surf species with the highest BE (corresponding to the lowest electron density and thus highest reduction-potential) on the silica surface during the treatment, while the effect from the variation of its neighborhood surrounding (e.g. the second Cr species) also cannot be ruled out. The FWHM value of the second Cr species is only 0.25eV higher than that of bulk Cr2O3 measured in this work and almost the same as the average FWHM value of the bulk Cr2O3 calculated from the references [29,30,32,41] (shown in Table 1), so it is reasonable to assign this Cr species as bulk Cr2O3. As pointed out by Hercules et al. [35], sometimes it is difficult to judge the oxidation state of surface Cr species from the BE value due to its greater deviation than the FWHM, and the chemical shifts may be caused from the changes of both the atomic valence state and potential interaction with its environment. Here the chemical shift of the BE for the bulk Cr2O3 on S-2 towards higher position (contrary to the lower position of the pure bulk Cr2O3) can be rationalized by the explanation of its coexistence with the Cr(VI)O x,surf species on the silica surface. Moreover, this bulk Cr2O3 converted from the highly dispersed Cr(III)O x,surf and Cr(VI)O x,surf species by moisture most probably aggregated as dispersed micro-crystals covered on the chromate-rich areas (strong Lewis acids and much more electron-negative compared with the SiO2 and Cr2O3) during the treatment. Consequently, the electron-releasing effect from the bulk Cr2O3 leads to its chemical shift to higher position. The above interpretation is favorably supported by the Best et al.’s report [31] on CrO x /SiO2 catalysts (300–600°C in air for 4h) with 8wt.% Cr loading. They found, when the bulk Cr2O3 coexists with chromate species (most probably also bulk CrO3) on the catalysts calcined at lower temperature (300–400 °C), its BE lies between 577.4 and 577.5eV, whereas when all the Cr species is converted into bulk Cr2O3 at higher temperature (500–600°C), then the BE decreases to 577.1eV. Rahman et al. [26] investigated CrO x /alumna catalysts (500–800°C in air for 24h) with 5–15wt.% Cr and found the BE of bulk Cr2O3 in mixed state with chromate species lies between 577.2 and 577.6eV. According to XPS study of Cimino et al. [29], bulk Cr2O3 was found on Phillips CrO x /SiO2 catalysts (300–700°C in air for 5h, 1–9wt.% Cr) in mixture with chromate species at high Cr loading and/or high temperature, whereas it is very difficult to compare our XPS data with theirs due to the following reasons. Their curve fittings were just applied to the single Cr 2p(3/2) peak, and this might be at the risk of losing original information especially when the surface Cr species was in mixed oxidation states [28,42]. Moreover, they presented no BE and FWHM data except the final ratio of Cr(VI):Cr(III). For sample S-3 treated in moisture-contained N2 flow, approximately the same results were obtained, that is two kinds of surface Cr species were found namely the first with a BE of 581.74eV and a FWHM of 8.30eV assigned as chromate species (atomic concentration 60.8%) and the second with a BE of 577.64eV and a FWHM of 3.26eV assigned as bulk Cr2O3 (atomic concentration 39.2%). It means all the Cr(III)O x,surf species (i.e. ca. 30% of all surface Cr) and about one-seventh of the Cr(VI)O x,surf species (i.e. ca. 10% of all surface Cr) was converted into bulk Cr2O3 in the presence of moisture upon the 800°C calcination for 2h whatever pure air(oxidizing) or N2 (neutral) was used. As illustrated in Table 2, the decrease of relative intensity of the Cr 2p level from 3.8 to 2.6 for S-2 and 2.7 for S-3 is also a reflection of the serious aggregation of Cr2O3 microcrystals [32]. Some part of the Cr2O3 microcrystals was surely beyond the XPS surface sensitivity restricted by the typical mean photoelectron escape depth of ca. 2nm [35]. This is further clarified by the EPMA measurements. The EPMA map and line analysis of Cr distribution state reveals the highly aggregated Cr species on the S-2 and S-3 samples and the aggregation degree of surface Cr species is also similar for this two samples. Fig. 5 shows the EPMA map image and line curves of the S-2 sample. Besides many dispersed micro-particles in sizes of several 100nm to several microns, which were supposed to be crystallized aggregates of Cr2O3, a few large aggregated Cr islands (marked in circles in Fig. 5(a) corresponding to the large peaks in Fig. 5(b)) were also found. The similar oxidation and distribution states of Cr on S-2 and S-3 samples obviously demonstrate that the formation of bulk Cr2O3 is through the second route (Eq. (2)) rather than the first one(Eq. (1)), that is the supported Cr(III)O x,surf species is cleft by moisture directly resulting in the formation of Cr2O3. The Cr(VI)O x,surf species (ca. one-seventh of all Cr(VI)O x,surf species), which was converted into bulk Cr2O3 during the treatments, was also supposed to be firstly thermal-reduced into Cr(III)O x,surf species and then cleft by moisture due to the similar results between S-2 and S-3. Groeneveld et al. [14] studied the H2-reduction (330–450°C) of a CrO x /SiO2 (500°C in air for 4h) catalyst with ca. 0.37 Cr/nm2. Before H2-reduction, no decomposition into α-Cr2O3 was confirmed, whereas after reduction by H2, the catalyst contains Cr2+ and Cr3+, and the latter in various states of clustering. They postulated that the moisture formed in reduction reaction oxidizes the Cr(II)O x,surf to Cr(III)O x,surf species and hydrolyzes the monochromate or dichromate species into polychromate followed by the thermal-reduction of polychromate to Cr2O3. According to our experimental results and analysis, the thermal-reduction of chromate species (including polychromate) at such low temperature range (330–450°C) sounds unreasonable, and it would be much more acceptable to hypothesize that the Cr clustering in their H2-reduced catalyst is originated from the interaction between the moisture and the Cr(III)O x,surf species. 3.3 Speculation on the formation mechanism of the aggregated Cr2O3 So far, a plausible mechanism concerning the formation of Cr2O3 microcrystals during calcination in the preparation process of the Phillips catalyst with an industrial level of Cr loading ca. 0.4 Cr/nm2 can be speculated in Scheme 1 . At the first stage (reaction (1) in Scheme 1.), the bulk CrO3 is dispersed and stabilized as surface chromate species (i.e. monochromate and dichromate, sometimes even polychromate) through the reaction with the surface groups on silica during the calcination process from r.t. to 800°C in dry air. Gradually, a highly dispersed state of chromate species can be achieved through many redispersion cycles of sublimation, volatilization, spreading, deposition, and stabilization of bulk CrO3, as well as hydrolysis, re-spreading, re-deposition and re-stabilization of chromate species on the support surface. These redispersion cycles may be facilitated by the presence of traces of moisture generating from the successive dehydroxylation of silica in the early stage of dispersing and supporting of bulk CrO3 during calcination. During this period, the thermal decomposition of bulk CrO3 can also be sufficiently inhibited by the presence of oxidizing gas(dry air or O2). Gradually, the dehydroxylation also results in increasing strain in surface siloxane groups and thus increasing reduction-potential of the surface chromate species. At certain critical point the calcination-induced reduction of chromate species to Cr(III)O x,surf species would be expected (reaction (2) in Scheme 1). Thereafter, further evolved traces of moisture from dehydroxylation might split some Cr(III)O x,surf species from silica surface leading to the formation of Cr2O3 microcrystals (reaction (3) in Scheme 1). Higher temperature, longer duration and higher content of moisture in the last stage of calcination process are sure to bring about more serious aggregation of surface Cr species. Further confirmation investigation of this mechanism assumption concerning the calcination in the preparation process of the Phillips catalyst is necessary and still in progress in terms of different calcination conditions especially in the earlier stage of calcination. The results will be available for publication later soon. 4 Conclusions The physico-chemical state and aggregation mechanism of surface Cr species on an industrial Phillips CrO x /SiO2 catalyst calcined in dry air at 800°C for 20h with 0.4 Cr/nm2 Cr loading are investigated by the combined techniques of XPS and EPMA. Firstly, a clear image of the physico-chemical state of surface Cr species on the catalyst is obtained, that is the co-existence of three kinds of surface Cr species on the catalyst surface namely the Cr(VI)O x,surf (ca. 70%) and Cr(III)O x,surf species (ca. 29%) and small amount of aggregated Cr2O3 microcrystals. Consequently, the calcination-induced reduction of Cr(VI)O x,surf to Cr(III)O x,surf species as well as the formation of Cr2O3 microcrystals in a calcined Phillips catalyst with relatively low Cr loading were specifically confirmed. Further investigation is focused on the origin and formation mechanism of this aggregated Cr2O3 microcrystals. The role of moisture in the formation of aggregated Cr2O3 during the calcination treatment of the catalyst is studied in terms of calcination atmosphere (pure air or N2), in which extra moisture was introduced for getting more pronounced information. Substantially, the Phillips catalyst (S-1) was further thermal-treated at 800°C for 2h in moisture-contained pure air (S-2) and moisture-contained nitrogen (S-3) flow, respectively, before XPS and EPMA measurements. It was found that the purposely introduced moisture induced the transformation of all the Cr(III)O x,surf species and one-seventh of the Cr(VI)O x,surf species into aggregates of Cr2O3 at high temperature in this two samples without any obvious difference generated between using the oxidizing and inert atmosphere. Finally, the formation mechanism of aggregated Cr2O3 microcrystals induced by traces of moisture through cleavage of the Cr(III)O x,surf species during the calcination had been speculated considering of the indispensable evolution of traces of moisture from the simultaneous dehydroxylation of residual hydroxyl groups on silica surface.

The XPS results showed the coexistence of surface-stabilized hexavalent chromate species (70.4% expressed as Cr(VI)O x,surf) and trivalent chromium oxide (29.6%) on the catalyst. The latter derived from calcination-induced reduction of the Cr(VI)O x,surf species is mostly chemically-bonded to the silica surface (expressed as Cr(III)O x,surf). The EPMA map and line curves of the Cr distribution state on the catalyst revealed a small amount of the trivalent chromium oxide existed as a few aggregates in sizes of 200–300nm on the surface of each particle, which were supposed to be crystallized aggregates of Cr2O3. Consequently, the calcination-induced reduction of Cr(VI)O x,surf to Cr(III)O x,surf species and the formation of Cr2O3 microcrystals on the Phillips catalyst with relatively low Cr loading were specifically confirmed. The variation of distribution and oxidation states of surface Cr species for the catalyst after being further calcined at 800°C for 2h in the presence of moisture had also been studied in terms of the role of moisture and effect of atmosphere (pure air or N2).
