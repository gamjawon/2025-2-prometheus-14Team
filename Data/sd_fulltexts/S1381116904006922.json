Fax: +58 212 239 21 62. Perovskites type oxides La1−x Ca x Ru1−x Ni x O3 were synthesized by the citrate sol–gel method. Characterization was carried out underlying the modification of metal catalysts by promoters by total or partial substitution of A- and B-site cations. The influence of Ru partial substitution by Ni in the LaRuO3 structure and of La by Ca on LaRu0.8Ni0.2O3 was also investigated in the dry and combine reforming of methane. All perovskites series, showed a well-defined perovskite structure with surface areas between 2 and 17m2/g. After reduction Ru(Ni) crystallites size in the order of 10–15nm were produced. An oxygen deficiency was shown by most perovskites. Substitution of La by Ca of smaller ionic radium decreases the stability of the perovskites and lowers their reduction temperature. Among the calcium series, La0.8Ca0.2Ru0.8Ni0.2O3, proved to be the most active precursor catalyst with the highest selectivity to syngas. Correlation between the effect of partial or total substitution of La by Ca as A-site cation of the precursor perovskite, the catalytic activity and stability of in situ formed Ru(Ni) particles was established. Graphical abstract Perovskites type oxides La1−x Ca x Ru1−x Ni x O3 catalysts were developed to transform CH4 and CO2, two cheap contaminating chemicals, to more valuable feedstock such as syngas. Characterization was performed to obtain a better appreciation of the principles underlying the modification of metal catalysts by promoters by total or partial substitution of A- and B-site cations. The influence of Ru partial substitution by Ni in the LaRuO3 structure and of La by Ca on LaRu0.8Ni0.2O3 was also investigated in the dry and combine reforming of methane. After reduction Ru(Ni) crystallites size in the order of 10–15nm were produced. Correlation between the effect of partial or total substitution of La by Ca as A-site cation of the precursor perovskite on the catalytic activity and stability of in situ formed Ru(Ni) particles was established.

The use of precursors such as perovskite-like oxides ABO3, in which A-site cation is a rare earth and/or alkaline earth and B-site cation, is a transition metal has increased recently for methane reforming [1–5]. The ideal ABO3 perovskite structure is cubic in which the larger A-site cation is surrounded by 12 oxygen and the smaller B-site cation by 6. One interesting feature of these complex mixed-oxides is that their catalytic activity can be highly improved by partial substitution on A- and/or B-sites, with only small changes in the average structure [1,6–9]. Perovskites not only fulfill the stability requirements for the reforming reactions, but also by further reduction of B-site cations which remain distributed in the structure, they form well dispersed and stable metal particle catalysts [1,2,8]. The use of perovskite allows stabilizing small particles of the metal in position B [Ru, Ni] over a stable support (Ca-, La-oxides) to prevent carbon formation in the reforming of methane. The reduced solids of nominal composition (Ru, Ni)/La2O3 and/or CaO, are used as catalysts to establish correlations between the effect of partial or total substitution of A- and B-site cations of the precursor perovskite and the catalytic activity and stability of in situ formed metallic particles. 1.2 Methane conversion to syngas Even though steam reforming of methane is widely industrialized to produce syngas (a mixture of H2 and CO), lower ratios are needed for oxo- and Fischer–Tropsch synthesis. Carbon dioxide reforming of methane offers advantages such as the production of syngas with a lower H2/CO ratio and it obviates a water vaporization step to produce steam, an energy consumer process, and eliminate CH4 and CO2 two major greenhouse gases. Due to the high temperatures involved and the presence of steam, sinterization of the active metal species and coke formation lead to catalysts deactivation and in some cases to plugging of the reactor [10]. Methane conversion to syngas and H2 based in steam reforming occurs by the two following reactions [11]: (1) C H 4 + H 2 O ↔ CO + 3 H 2 ( Δ H 298 K = 206 kJ / mol ) (2) CO + H 2 O ↔ C O 2 + H 2 ( Δ H 298 K = − 41 kJ / mol ) These reactions produce syngas with a H2/CO ≥3 ratio. However, carbon dioxide reforming of methane, yielding synthesis gas with low hydrogen to carbon monoxide ratio, has received renewed interests to transform CO2 and CH4 to more valuable products. Further transformations to produce methanol, higher alcohols and Fischer–Tropsch to diesel and light alkenes require H2/CO ≤2 ratios, which can be accomplished by CO2 dry reforming and by partial oxidation: (3) C H 4 + C O 2 ↔ 2 CO + 2 H 2 ( Δ H 298 K = 247 kJ / mol ) (4) C H 4 + 1 2 O 2 ↔ CO + 2 H 2 ( Δ H 298 K = − 36 kJ / mol ) In these reactions, product distribution is thermodynamically controlled: H2 is favored at high temperature (700–800°C). However, to operate at high temperature introduces several potential problems: • catalyst sintering enhanced by the presence of water vapor; • catalyst stability; • coke formation by the following two reactions: (5) C H 4 ↔ C + 2 H 2 ( Δ H 298 K = + 75 kJ / mol ) (6) 2 CO ↔ C + C O 2 ( Δ H 298 K = − 173 kJ / mol ) Coke formation via reaction (5) is favored at high temperature while reaction (6) is favored at low temperature [12]. Experimental operational conditions must then be carefully chosen to minimize coke formation. In the present work, Perovskite-type based catalyst were developed to transform two cheap contaminating chemicals into more valuable feed stock and petrochemical such as syngas. Characterization was carried out to obtain a better appreciation of the principles underlying the modification of metal catalysts by promoters by total or partial substitution of A- and B-site cations. For comparison, some previous published results in the dry reforming of methane are included [1,2]. New results in the characterization and combine reforming of methane are also presented. 2 Experimental The experimental part comprises the synthesis of perovskite-type oxides, the preparation of the catalysts, their characterization by different physico-chemical techniques and their performance in the dry and combines methane-reforming reactions. 2.1 Synthesis of perovskite-type oxides Perovskites were synthesized by the citrate sol–gel method to ensure a good homogeneity of the mixed oxides. Adequate amounts of solutions of A- and B-site cations precursors were added to a solution of citric acid (99.5%, Riedel-de Haën) with an excess of ethylene glycol (99.5%, Riedel-de Haën) as the organic polydentate ligant as previously reported [1,2]. Adequate amounts of the precursor of the cation at B position were dissolved under vigorous stirring in a solution of citric acid (99.5%, Riedel-de Haën) with an excess of ethylene glycol (99.5%, Riedel-de Haën) as the organic polydentate ligant. The citric acid/B cation molar ratio was 4, while it was 1.38 for ethylene glycol/citric acid. The mixture was kept at 57°C with mild continuous stirring until a clear solution was obtained. At this point, a stoichiometric quantity of the precursor of cation A, La(NO3)3·5H2O or Ca(NO3)2·4H2O, was added while keeping the mixture at 57°C. The evaporating process proceeded for 2 days until a viscous resin was formed. The resin was dried at 150°C for 24h and calcined in air at 700°C. for 5h. 2.2 Characterization To assess the structural features of the perovskites, the solids were characterized as-synthesized, reduced and after catalytic tests by means of different techniques such as inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP), IR spectra, BET surface areas, X-ray diffraction experiments for crystalline phase detection and under temperature program reduction in H2, temperature program reduction (TPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. JCPDS-ICDD standard spectra software was used to determine the phases. The ruthenium crystallite size was calculated using Ru(101) reflection and the Scherrer equation [13,14]. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were performed with a VG ESCALAB 220 XL spectrometer. The monochromatic Al Kα (1486.6eV) source was operated at 80W. For the XPS analysis, the reduction treatments were conducted in situ using H2 as reducing agent and left 9h at 500°C (heating rate 2°C/min). Auto-coherent references were used: La 3d5/2 at 833.8eV, Ru 3d5/2 at 280.2eV and O 1s at 529.3eV. 2.3 Activity test Activity tests were performed using 200mg of catalyst in a 20mm i.d. quartz reactor at atmospheric pressure operated in a fixed-bed continuous flow system with CH4/CO2 =1 for the dry reforming and CH4/CO2/O2 =4/1/2 for the combine reforming. Argon was used as diluent, 750–850°C, and 24L/(hg) hourly space velocities. Before the catalytic tests, the solids were reduced in H2 flow (20mL/min, T =700°C, 8h). After reduction, the system was swept with Ar for 15min and adjusted to reaction temperature. The water produced during reaction, was condensed before passing the reactants and products to the analyzing system, which consisted of an on-line gas chromatograph (Perkin Elmer Auto System XL) equipped with a TCD and provided with a Carbosieve SII 80/100(12in.×1/8in.o.d. SS). The conversions of CH4 and CO2 were defined as the converted CH4 and CO2 per total amount of CH4 and CO2 fed, respectively. The selectivity for product “i” was calculated based in carbon balance and defined as Si (%)=(Ni/(NCH4 (c)+NCO2 (c)))×100, where NCH4 (c) and NCO2 (c) are the amount of methane and carbon dioxide converted. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Perovskites characterization: surface area, chemical analysis, IR and XRD The chemical analysis of all synthesized perovskites showed a close similarity between analytical and nominal values, indicating the coincidence of real and nominal formula and the advantage of the sol–gel synthesis, as previously reported [1,2]. An oxygen deficiency was shown by most perovskites. Table 1 lists the synthesized perovskites, their measured surface area, IR bands position, cell parameters and their corresponding symmetry. All synthesized solids showed two bands in the medium IR region at 600–500 and 400–450cm−1 characteristics of the perovskite structure. Their positions are in good agreement with those reported in [1,5,15]. The position of the IR bands allows establishing the strength of BO bond and its modification by substitution of the B cation. A compromise between the ease of reduction of the perovskite and its catalytic activity has been observed: catalytic activity being reverse to the ν 1 values. BET specific surface areas measured after calcinations are in the order of 2–7m2/g, which are high compare to the usual values obtained for these solids [16]. The X-ray diffraction analysis of the as-synthesized solids at room temperature revealed that the perovskite structure was the main phase detected for all solids with high crystallinity and well-defined symmetry, in agreement with previously reported values [17,18]. Most perovskites could be indexed with an orthorhombic or cubic symmetry of the ABO3 type (Table 1). TEM–EDX investigations performed on the fresh, reduced and used perovskite series revealed small and faceted metallic particles, given an average metallic dispersion for the series between 60% and 70%, except for the LaRu0.4Ni0.6O3, where the dispersion was close to 9%. In situ XRD and TPR analysis shown that as the temperature is raised, cations in B-site position are reduced to metals while those in A-site position are transformed to the respective oxides [1]. For all solids, the observed phases after reduction at 700°C were: Ru metal (alone or allied with Ni), CaO and La2O3 depending on the composition of the starting solid. XRD analysis was also used to determine the metal particles size of the crystallites by means of the Scherrer equation [13,14]. Peaks correspond mainly to Ru (44.37°, 2θ) slightly shifted, due to the presence of Ni. For all structures, the calculated mean particle size values are between 10 and 15nm (Table 2 ), indicating the existence of high dispersion and/or uniform distribution of Ru(Ni) in the CaO–La2O3 matrix. On the lanthanum containing perovskites, dioxomono carbonate, La2O2CO3, was also observed. This layer is in fast equilibrium with the carbon dioxide in the gas phase during reaction, and has been claimed as responsible for inhibiting formation of deactivating coke [19,20]. After 30h of reaction, the TEM–EDX analysis showed that this layer remains in most of the solids [1,2]; however, was not detected after longer reaction periods, due essentially to carbon deposition. 3.2 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) Table 3 lists the XPS composition for Ru and oxygen. Results showed that under the experimental conditions used only B-site cations (Ru and Ni) are reduced to the zero oxidation state, while those cations in A-site position do not show any reduction, as confirm by in situ XRD and TPR studies [1]. For the mixed LaRu1−x Ni x O3 perovskite-type oxides, two well-defined peaks for Ru 3d5/2, one at ≈280eV attributed to Ru0 and a second one at ≈282.6eV corresponding to unreduced Ru (Ru(III)) was observed. As the amount of Ni increases on the perovskites, the reducibility of Ru decreases. For the more active perovskite (LaRu0.8Ni0.2O3), the signal attributed to Ru(III) appears at 281.7eV indicating the existence of a different Ru species in this solid probably due to partially reduced Ru. Before reduction, Ru in LaRuO3 and LaRu0.8Ni0.2O3 appears mainly as oxide with a small amount of Ru metal. After reduction, the main phase is Ru metal with small amount of Ru oxide in different proportions, as seen in Table 3. The wider shape of the signal corroborated the presence of several Ru species in this solid. Since activity of the perovskites is usually related to the mobility of oxygen on the solid, the chemical state of oxygen on the surface was also examined. Table 3 shows the oxygen XPS composition. Signals were assigned as: 529eV to O− of the perovskite lattice oxide; 531eV to O− bonded to La, Ru or Ni in an OH environment; ∼532eV peroxides O2 − or OH correspond to O less rich in electrons, weaker and more reactive [21]. Atomic ratios for LaRu x Ni1−x O3 series are shown in Table 4 . As expected, some oxygen is lost after reduction. The Ru/La and Ni/La ratios are lower than the nominal value except for LaRu0.6Ni0.4O3. Table 5 shows the bulk and surface stoichiometry of the reduced La1−x Ca x Ru0.8Ni0.2O3 series perovskites. To evaluate the chemical state and evolution of the metals at the surface, a semi-quantitative analysis was performed. Only Ru/O and Ru/(A+A′) ratios are presented since attempts to extract reliable quantification of Ni was extremely difficult due to the severe covering of the Ni 2p signals by the complex La 3d region and the low nickel content on this series: La1−x Ca x Ru0.8Ni0.2O3 [1]. If it is assumed that for the Ca–La series Ru0, CaO and La2O3 are the main phases present after reduction, as observed by XRD, the Ru/O ratio should be around three times smaller than that of Ru/La [22,23]. However, it is observed that the substitution of lanthanum by calcium lead to a Ru/O ratio approximately equal to that of Ru/La indicating a great deficiency in oxygen. These results are in good agreement with ICP and TPR observations, where the formation of an oxygen deficient perovskite of the type La1−x Ca x Ru0.8Ni0.2O3−λ was invoked to compensate for the difference in charge produced when Ca2+ substitutes La3+. In agreement with TPR and XRD results, the observed oxygen deficiency was lower for the most stable perovskite LaRu0.8Ni0.2O3. From the XPS results, the question of why LaRu0.8Ni0.2O3 produces the most active catalyst is difficult to answer. However, there are some possibilities/causes to be considered: • The activity does not seem to be related to the amount of Ru at the surface since (LaRuO3 has more Ru in the surface than LaRu0.8Ni0.2O3). • Since it is higher for LaRu0.8Ni0.2O3, it could be related to Ru/Ni ratio. • LaRu0.8Ni0.2O3 is the only sample to show Ru 3d5/2 a 281.7eV after reduction. • Activity related to the quantity of Ru and/or Ni in the perovskite (oxide state)? • The degree of reduction? Reduced LaRu0.8Ni0.2O3 has the lower ratio O/La. • Related to the presence of carbon or carbonate? LaRu0.8Ni0.2O3 seems to have low carbon presence (C 1s∼289–290eV). • Related to oxygen liability (O2 − at 532.7eV). 3.3 Catalytic studies In previous work [1,2], the dry reforming of methane to syngas was carried out, optimizing reaction conditions to higher yields of syngas. It was found that the best Ru–Ni combination was obtained for LaRu0.8Ni0.2O3 while on calcium containing perovskites La0.8Ca0.2Ru0.8Ni0.2O3 produced higher ratio of H2/CO. Calcium was used to increase the basicity of the catalysts in order to further inhibit coke formation. In the present work, the behavior of some of those precursor perovskites in the combine reforming of methane was studied. Addition of oxygen to carbon dioxide reforming of methane can reduce the carbon deposition on the catalyst surface and increase methane conversion. This combine reaction emerges as an alternative of particular interest since it allows working at lower temperatures, due to the exothermic character of the partial oxidation reaction, which not only improves the H2/CO ratio in the product, but traduces in lower energy consumption and a more economical way of methane conversion [7,24]. Table 6 compares the CH4 and CO2 conversions, CO selectivity, dispersion and carbon balance for La–Ru–Ni perovskite-type oxides. On these solids, steady state conditions for the perovskite oxide series were reached rapidly, remaining almost constant for up to 150h, except for the LaNiO3 solid which start loosing some activity after 100h due essentially to carbon deposition on the Ni crystallites. With the exception of the LaRuO3 solid, all perovskites showed a CH4 conversion higher than that of CO2 at all temperatures. This could imply that steam reforming of methane and/or methane cracking is taking place. When compared under isoconversion conditions, the LaRu0.8Ni0.2O3 perovskite was the best precursor catalyst. The high activity shown by this solid is attributed to its higher metallic dispersion (89%) compare to LaRu0.4Ni0.6O3 (9%), which showed the lower activity (see Table 6). The metal dispersion plays a fundamental role in these reactions as pointed out by Kim et al. for structure sensitive reactions [25]. For the Ca–La perovskites, under optimized experimental conditions, catalysts did not show significant coke deposition even after 120h on stream (1.38% carbon/g of catalyst), maintaining their activity and selectivity to CO, which corroborate the low coke formed in these solids. For the combine reaction, an important increase in CH4 conversion at different temperatures was observed on LaRu0.8Ni0.2O3, especially at lower temperatures (Fig. 1 ). Oxygen consumption was always 100%, in agreement with the results of Schmal and coworker on Pt supported catalysts [26]. Since the partial oxidation is an exothermic reaction, the energy liberated enhances the endothermic reaction favoring activity. However, the CO2 conversion decreases for all catalysts when O2 is added to the system. This behavior could be explained by the fact that O2 is a stronger oxidizing agent than CO2 and its production is favored by reaction (7) where CO2 is being generated as a product of the methane combustion in presence of O2: (7) C H 4 + O 2 ↔ 2 C O 2 + 2 H 2 ( Δ H 298 K = − 802 kJ / mol ) When La is substituted by Ca, a decrease in both its activity and selectivity is observed, as shown in Table 7 . This decrease is produced because the substitution of a cation of larger ionic radium by a smaller one induces changes in the perovskite needed for charge compensation as determined by ICP, TPR and XPS. Oxygen addition to the CH4 +CO2 system, decreases the reaction temperature and the energy consumption, indicating that the partial oxidation (exothermic) reaction promotes the dry (endothermic) reaction, in accordance with observations of Tomishige et al. on Ni/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts [8]. 4 Conclusions It was observed that preparation of the precursor perovskites by the sol–gel method produces solids with high homogeneity and crystallinity which showed a well-defined perovskite structure as confirmed by the different characterization techniques. TEM–EDX analysis and XRD studies performed on the LaRu1−x Ni x O3 series revealed the complete destruction of the perovskite with reduction of Ru and/or Ni. During reaction, formation of small and faceted metallic particles with dispersions between 60% and 70% was observed, together with the existence of a significant amount of a La2O2CO3 phase, especially on the LaRu0.8Ni0.2O3. Reduction before reaction of the precursor perovskites produced small metallic particles that avoid coke formation and give rise to active and stable catalysts. Due to the stability shown by these solids, it is believed that this phase highly contributed to the resistance to deactivation. All perovskites oxides, except LaRu0.4Ni0.6O3 were found to be highly active toward the syngas production during the CO2 reforming of methane. Among the solids tested, the LaRu0.8Ni0.2O3 showed a high potential as a catalyst for this reaction, reaching conversions of 89% and 72% in CH4 and CO2, respectively, with CO selectivity close to 90% even after 150h on stream. The simultaneous oxidative and CO2 reforming reaction of methane notably diminish coke formation, increasing activity and syngas production at lower temperature.
