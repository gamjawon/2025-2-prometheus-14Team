Copper (Cu)-based catalysts show significant potential for producing high value-added C2+ products in electrocatalytic CO2/CO reduction reactions (CO(2)RR). However, the structural reconfiguration during operation poses substantial challenges in identifying the intrinsic catalytic active site, especially under similar mass transport conditions. Herein, three typical and commercial Cu-based catalysts (Cu, CuO, and Cu2O) are chosen as representatives to elucidate the structure-activity relationship of CORR in the membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer. Notably, only the Cu catalyst demonstrates the most suppression of hydrogen evolution reaction, thus achieving the highest FE of 86.7% for C2+ products at a current density of 500 mA cm–2 and maintaining a stable electrolysis over 110 h at a current of 200 mA cm–2. The influence of chemical valence state of Cu, electrochemical surface area, and local pH were firstly investigated and ruled out for the significant FE differences. Finally, based on the structure analysis from high resolution transmission electron microscope, OH– adsorption, in situ infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, it is suggested that the asymmetric C-C coupling (via *CHO and *CO) is the most probable reaction pathway for forming C2+ products, with Cu (100)-dominant grain boundaries (GBs) being the most favorable active sites. These findings provide deeper insights into the synergistic relationship between crystal facets and GBs in electrocatalytic systems. Graphical Abstract The Cu (100)-dominated grain boundaries demonstrate enhanced C2+ selectivity through an asymmetric C-C coupling mechanism mediated by *COatop and *CHO intermediates originating from *CObridge configurations at boundary interfaces. Keywords CO electroreduction Asymmetric C-C coupling Grain boundaries Cu-based catalyst C2+ product 1 Introduction The electroreduction of CO2 (CO2RR) to valuable chemicals and fuels using renewable energy is a promising strategy for mitigating climate change and establishing an artificial carbon cycle [1–5]. Strongly alkaline electrolytes are commonly used to enhance the production of multi-carbon (C2+) products such as ethylene (C2H4), ethanol (C2H5OH), acetate (CH3COOH), and n-propanol (n-C3H7OH). This is primarily due to their ability to suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and reduce the energy barriers for C-C coupling [6,7]. However, these highly alkaline electrolytes can also cause significant carbon loss, mainly because of the rapid neutralization reaction between CO2 and OH–, followed by the formation of (bi) carbonates [7–9]. This presents a substantial challenge for carbon and energy efficiency in the commercial application of CO2RR. To tackle this challenge, acidic CO2RR has recently gained significant interest due to its theoretical potential to completely prevent carbon loss [10]. However, its Faradaic efficiency (FE), current density, and stability are currently much lower than those of alkaline or neutral electrolyte systems [11,12]. From an application standpoint, a tandem electrolysis strategy involving CO2-to-CO and CO-to-C2+ (CORR) has emerged as a carbon-efficient pathway [13–15]. This is mainly because the CO2-to-CO conversion is well-established in both room temperature electrolysis and solid-oxide electrolysis [16,17]. Furthermore, CORR can operate in highly alkaline electrolytes without forming (bi) carbonates and subsequent carbon loss [18,19]. More importantly, the dynamics of C-C coupling can be enhanced in such highly basic environments to form C2+ products. Since CO is widely recognized as a key intermediate for C-C coupling and CORR shares similar reaction pathways with CO2RR, CORR serves as an excellent platform to deeply understand the mechanisms of CO protonation and C-C coupling [20–22], thereby facilitating the two-step pathway of CO2 electrolysis. Copper (Cu)-based catalysts are currently the most efficient for CO(2)RR to produce high-value C2+ products [23–25]. Unfortunately, despite recent advances in catalyst design for CO(2)RR, a deep understanding of active sites in Cu-based catalysts remains elusive, primarily due to their poor structural stability under operating conditions [26–28], which may lead to significant reconstruction. Moreover, emerging in situ and ex situ characterizations provide ambiguous evidence regarding the true active sites of Cu-based catalysts, including morphology evolution, local pH changes, valence state shifts, crystalline surface variations, and the formation of grain boundaries (GBs) [29–33]. These factors likely contribute to the improved activity and selectivity for C2+ product evolution. For example, Lv et al. [34] reported that the mixed Cu+/Cu0 states in Cu2O during reactions favor the C-C coupling towards C2+ products. While, Yao et al. [35] demonstrated that the Cu (100) crystal plane exhibits higher activity for C-C coupling to produce C2+ products compared with Cu (111). Additionally, Li et al. [36] proposed that in situ generated Cu GBs under negative potential account for the improved selectivity of C2+ products. Particularly, Bai et al. [37] reported that Cu with abundant (111) GBs promotes the conversion of CO2 to CO by reducing the formation energy barrier of *CO intermediates. While, Wu et al. [38] discovered that the electronic structure of the Cu (100)/Cu (111) interface demonstrates high reactivity towards multi-carbon products by reducing the activation energy barrier for the CO-CO dimerization reaction. It can be clearly found that the whether there existed a synergistic effect between the crystal plane of Cu and GBs are not very clear, especially under similar mass transport conditions. Overall, these complex influences pose a significant challenge in accurately understanding the structure-activity relationship of Cu-based catalysts for CO(2)RR [39]. In this work, three typical commercial Cu-based catalysts (Cu, CuO, and Cu2O) with different valence states were chosen as representatives to elucidate the structure-activity relationship of CORR in a zero-gap alkaline membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer. More importantly, our analysis is based on uniform mass transfer conditions. Notably, the Cu catalyst achieved the highest C2+ FE of 86.7%, with an H2 FE as low as 5.1% within the current density range of 100–500 mA cm–2. In contrast, the CuO and Cu2O catalysts produced much more H2, especially at higher current densities (> 200 mA cm–2). A series of characterizations including X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), in-situ Raman spectroscopy, electrochemical active surface area (ECSA), and local pH, ruled out Cu chemical valence state, ECSA, and local pH as factors accounting for the selectivity variations among three Cu-based catalysts. Consequently, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), OH- adsorptions, in situ attenuated total reflectance surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the asymmetric C-C coupling via *CO and *CHO (*CO-derived) at GBs dominated by Cu (100) was the most plausible reaction pathway for the formation of C2+ products. 2 Experimental 2.1 Chemicals and materials Copper (Cu, 60–100 nm) and methanol (99.9%) were purchased from Macklin. Copper oxide (CuO, 40 nm particle size) and Cuprous oxide (Cu2O) were purchased from Adamas-beta (Fig. S1). Nafion dispersion (D520) (5 wt% in a mixture of lower aliphatic alcohols and water) was purchased from Dupont. Copper (Cu, 1 μm), Potassium hydroxide (KOH, 95%) and Ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) was purchased from Aladdin. Sulfuric Acid (H2SO4, 98%) was purchased from Chron Chemicals. Potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3, 99.7%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Aluminum oxide powder (Al2O3, 50 nm) was purchased from Gaoss Union. Deionized water (18.25 MΩ cm) was used to prepare all aqueous solutions. All the chemicals were used without any further purification. 2.2 Electrode preparation The catalyst ink was systematically prepared by homogenizing 24 mg of catalytic material with 80 μL of Nafion ionomer in 8 mL methanol solvent through controlled ultrasonic dispersion (3 h). This ink was then sprayed onto the surface of the gas diffusion layer to produce gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs). To mitigate the potential interference of methanol in the slurry, the preparation of GDE was conducted at 80 °C. Subsequently, the GDE was left overnight to ensure complete volatilization of methanol before testing. The catalyst mass loading was 1.0 mg cm–2. 2.3 Characterizations XRD spectroscopy (Bruker D8 Advance), scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Gemini SEM 300), HRTEM (Tecnai F30), and XPS (ESCALAB 250XI) were used to characterize the structure and composition of the catalysts. 2.4 In situ Raman tests In situ Raman spectroscopic characterization was performed using a 633 nm excitation laser coupled to a spectrometer system. The scattered photons were spectrally resolved using a high-density 1800 lines/mm diffraction grating before detection. All spectral acquisitions employed a 20-s integration time with single-scan collection. To simulate practical catalytic environments for Cu, CuO, and Cu2O electrodes, a specially designed flow cell capable of sustaining high current density operations was used. Electrochemical measurements were conducted under controlled current densities spanning from –20 to –50 mA cm–2, parameters determined to effectively induce complete structural reorganization of copper-based catalysts through electrochemical reconstruction processes. Notably, current densities exceeding –50 mA cm–2 (up to 80–100 mA cm-2) resulted in substantial gas bubble evolution at the electrode surface, causing severe spectral artifacts that compromised data integrity. Each polarization condition was maintained for 120 seconds, with spectral acquisition intentionally delayed until the final 30-s interval to capture stabilized interfacial conditions. Continuous CO gas purging through the GDE backside ensured reactant saturation in the gas chamber. The electrochemical cell configuration employed 1 mol L–1 KOH electrolyte circulated through both cathode and anode compartments via peristaltic pumping systems, with ionic isolation between chambers achieved using a Nafion 115 proton-exchange membrane. 2.5 ECSA test The ECSA was determined via double-layer capacitance (C dl) measurements. After CO electrolysis at 100 mA cm–2 for 1 h in Ar-saturated 1 mol L–1 KOH, the system was purged with Ar, and electrolyte flow was halted to stabilize voltammetric signals. C dl was derived from the linear current-scan rate relationship (20–100 mV s–1) in the non-faradaic region, followed by normalization against a Cu foil reference. All tests were performed using a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation. 2.6 OH– adsorption test Owing to the absence of electrolyte in the MEA reactor’s cathode compartment, in situ OH- adsorption analysis was implemented using an Ar-purged flow cell configuration. Preceding OH- adsorption characterization, catalyst preconditioning was implemented through galvanostatic CO electroreduction (100 mA cm–2, 1 h) with continuous CO supply (20 mL min–1) and 1 mol L–1 KOH electrolyte circulation. Subsequently cyclic voltammetry (CV) was implemented by switching the gas supply to Ar in Ar-saturated 1 mol L–1 KOH electrolyte, with potential scanning between 0.2–0.5 V vs. RHE at 100 mV s–1. All measurements utilized a CHI 760E potentiostat. 2.7 In-situ ATR-SEIRAS test The in-situ ATR-SEIRAS characterization was conducted in a three-electrode system reactor equipped with dual independent chambers. For working electrode preparation, 50 μL of catalyst ink was drop-casted onto the Au-coated Si prism and air-dried under ambient conditions. In situ ATR-SEIRAS analysis employed a Bruker INVENIO R spectrometer with mercury cadmium telluride detector, operating at 4 cm–1 resolution with 30 s acquisition time per spectrum. Prior to initiating the experiment, 30 mL of CO-saturated 1 mol L–1 KOH solution was introduced into both chambers and the CO gas flow rate was maintained at 20 mL min–1. During spectral collection Linear sweep voltammetry was conducted at 3 mV s–1 within the range of open circuit voltage (OCP) to –1.5 V vs. RHE. 2.8 Computational details All the calculations are implemented by the VASP code. The GGA-PBE functional is selected for the exchange and correlation potential. Weak van der Waals interaction is considered by the DFT-D3 functional. The cut off energy for the plane-wave is 400 eV. The Gamma point in the Brillouin-zone is chosen for integration. Total energies of the systems converge to 10–5 eV in the iteration solution of Kohn-Sham equation. We built three models of Cu (111)/Cu (111), Cu (100)/Cu (111) and Cu (100)/Cu (100). The (111)-(111) model is built by the (111) and (-1-11) surfaces. The (111)-(100) model is built by the (111) and (100) surfaces. The (100-100) model is built by the (001) and (100) surfaces. The force on each atom reduce to 0.05 eV Å–1 after geometry optimization. The Gibbs free energy is defined as G = E tot + E ZPE – TS, where E tot, E ZPE, and TS are total energy, zero-point energy, and entropy of the system. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 CORR performance Three commercially available Cu-based catalysts (Cu, CuO, and Cu2O) with distinct valence states were chosen as representatives to prepare the GDEs. The powder XRD spectra revealed characteristic peaks corresponding to Cu (PDF #85-1326, Fig. S2(a)), CuO (PDF #72-0629), and Cu2O (PDF #78-2076) (Figs. S3 and S4). Then, the prepared GDEs were used for subsequent electrochemical testing. (Fig. S5(a)). The evaluation of CORR performance was conducted in a zero-gap MEA electrolyzer (Figs. S5(b) and (c)). After pre-activation at a constant current density of 50 mA cm-2 for 30 min, gas and liquid products at different current densities (50, 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 mA cm–2) were analyzed using online gas chromatography (GC9790Plus, FULI INSTRUMENTS) with headspace sampler and ion chromatography, respectively. (Figs. S6-S8). The FE versus current densities is shown in Figs. 1(a)–(c) . The main products of three catalysts are H2, C2H4, C2H5OH, CH3COOH, n-C3H7OH, with little detection of C1 products such as methanol (CH3OH). In order to make sure that the tiny methanol amount formed during CO reduction does not come from methanol impurities in the GDE, we systematically analyzed the product distribution under varying current densities using the one electrode. By carefully comparing Figs. 1(a)–(c), it seems the main difference between Cu, CuO, and Cu2O is H2 selectivity, which is minimal for Cu and steadily increases for CuO and Cu2O. Notably, the Cu catalyst achieved the highest FE(C2+) of 86.7%, with an FE(H2) as low as 5.1% within the current density range of 100–500 mA cm–2 (Fig. 1(a)). In contrast, the CuO and Cu2O catalysts produced much more H2, especially at higher current densities (> 200 mA cm–2) (Figs. 1(b) and (c)). The FE ratio of C2+ to H2 on Cu (8.5–13.5) is much higher than those of other two catalysts (< 5) (Fig. 1(d)), indicating that the active sites of Cu might be more favorable for the evolution of C2+ products. Consequently, the partial current density (j partial) of C2+ products follows the order: Cu > CuO > Cu2O, with the highest j partial of C2+ reaching up to 432 mA cm–2 on Cu (Fig. 1(e)), which is consistent with the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) results (Fig. S9). Furthermore, the full cell voltage of MEA for Cu is relatively lower than that of CuO and Cu2O, especially at higher current density of 500 mA cm–2, which is 3.27, 3.36, and 3.37 V (Fig. 1(f)), respectively. This is also confirmed by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results (Fig. S10), where the favorable dynamics at the active site on Cu might contribute to the lower impedance and cell voltage. Finally, we compared the CORR performance of the Cu catalyst with advanced catalysts reported in the literature. Notably, the Cu catalyst showed medium-to-high performance in both current density and FE of C2+ products (Fig. 1(g), Table S1), which is superior to many catalysts synthesized in the laboratory or equivalent. Moreover, we conducted a long-term stability test of the Cu catalyst using a MEA electrolyzer. The result shows that it can operate stably for over 110 hours at a current density of 200 mA cm–2, maintaining a C2+ FE of nearly 87.66 ± 0.80%, with a full cell voltage of approximately 3 V (Fig. 1(h), Fig. S11). These findings prompt us to explore the underlying reasons affecting their selective differences. 3.2 Cu valence state To elucidate the superior performance of CORR with the Cu catalyst, we first examined the effect of the Cu valence state in the three catalysts before and after the reaction. Notably, during the preparation of the GDEs, the Cu catalyst was partially oxidized to Cu2O (Fig. S2(b)), whereas no significant changes were observed for the Cu2O and CuO catalysts (Figs. S3 and S4), as indicated by the XRD results. The XPS Cu 2p spectra of Cu also exhibited distinct satellite peaks, similar to the Cu 2p spectra of CuO, suggesting the presence of a Cu2+ phase in Cu-GDE (Fig. S12). These results indicate that the Cu-GDE before the reaction is a mixed valence state. Conversely, after constant electrolysis at 200 mA cm–2 for 60 min, the XRD patterns of all three catalysts displayed only the characteristic diffraction peaks of the Cu phase, specifically Cu (111), Cu (200), and Cu (220) (Fig. 2(a) ). This result implies that all the catalysts were predominantly reduced to metallic Cu. The absence of discernible reduction peaks of oxidative Cu in the LSV curves further corroborates this finding (Fig. S9). To further investigate the surface valence state of Cu, ex-situ XPS characterization was conducted immediately after the reaction. Unlike the XRD results, the Cu 2p spectra of all three catalysts displayed a similar and distinct satellite peak, suggesting the presence of Cu+ or Cu2+ on the surface. The Cu LMM analysis also confirmed a mixed valence state of Cu on the three catalysts after the reaction (Fig. 2(b)). However, we observed that the Cu LMM peaks of the three catalysts after the reaction were very similar (Fig. 2(b)), indicating an analogous chemical valence state of Cu on their surfaces. Further fitting of the Cu 2p and Cu LMM peaks showed that the proportions of Cu0, Cu+, and Cu2+ among the three catalysts are very close (Fig. 2(c), Fig. S13 and Fig. S14, Table S2). Overall, the XRD and XPS results indicated that the bulk phase of the three Cu-based catalysts was mostly reduced to metallic Cu. However, as oxide-derived Cu is shown to be easily re-oxidized when exposed to air, the surface valence state of Cu during the reaction remains undetermined. To determine the accurate surface valence state of copper the during the reaction, in situ Raman spectroscopy was employed during the catalytic process. Before applying a negative current, distinct characteristic peaks corresponding to CuO (292 cm–1) and Cu2O (147, 217, 633 cm–1) species could be observed in Figs. 2(d)–(f), respectively [40]. Notably, the Raman peak at 147 cm–1 in Fig. 2(d) indicates partial self-oxidation of Cu into Cu2O, consistent with the XRD results (Fig. S2). Thereafter, we collected Raman spectra in the current range from –20 to –50 mA cm–2. The results indicated that with more negative applied currents, the characteristic peaks of CuO and Cu2O gradually disappeared, indicating that these surface species was in situ electrochemically reduced to metallic Cu. Meanwhile, three new Raman vibrational peaks at 283, 368, and 532 cm–1 were appeared on all three catalysts (Figs. 2(d)–(f)), which can be attributed to the frustrated rotation and stretching modes of *CO on Cu (Cu-CO) and the vibrational mode of *OH on Cu (Cu-OH), respectively [41–43]. Additionally, slight shifts in the Raman signal within the range of 280–284 (Cu-CO rotation band), 368–388 (Cu-CO stretching band), and 528–534 (Cu-OH) can be assigned to the adsorption of intermediate species on the Cu surface during CO electrolysis [43]. The above findings demonstrated that the surfaces of all three catalysts were converted into metallic Cu, regardless of the initial chemical state of Cu, which further preclude the role of Cu chemical state in affecting the CORR performance among three catalysts. 3.3 ECSA and local pH To further elucidate the reasons behind the selectivity differences in C2+ products, we then conducted the SEM characterizations of the catalysts before and after reaction. SEM images revealed that all three catalysts are nanostructured and well-dispersed both before and after reaction, except for a decrease in particle size. The average particle size of Cu, Cu2O, and CuO were calculated to be 240, 700, and 175 nm, respectively, which decreased to 160, 350, and 135 nm after the reaction (Fig. S15). This variation in particle size suggests that all catalysts underwent reconstruction during the reaction. Consequently, whether the post-reconstruction change in particle size could be a key factor contributing to the selectivity differences warrants investigation. To verify this hypothesis, quantifying surface active sites is essential [44]. Then, we conducted CV measurements to determine the C dl and ECSA of Cu, CuO, and Cu2O, where the C dl values were 0.635, 0.673, and 0.693 mF cm–2, and the corresponding ECSA values were 21.9, 23.2, and 23.9 cm2 ECSA, respectively (Fig. 2(g), Fig. S16, Table S3). The similar C dl and ECSA values among the three catalysts suggest that the variation in particle size after the reaction does not contribute to the differences in the number of electrochemically active sites. We also employed the Pb underpotential deposition (UPD) method to validate the ECSA, where the values for Cu and Cu2O were very similar, consistent with the results obtained by the CV method. An exception was observed for CuO, whose ECSA was relatively larger than that of Cu and Cu2O based on the UPD method (Fig. S17). This discrepancy may be attributed to differences of supporting electrolytes between the two methods. Nevertheless, considering the substantial selectivity disparity between Cu and Cu2O, their ECSA values determined by two different methods are still similar, suggesting that ECSA might not be the primary factor affecting the CORR selectivity among these Cu-based catalysts. On the other hand, it is well known that the local pH on the catalyst surface, closely related to specific surface area as well as the ECSA of catalysts, greatly influence the kinetics of HER and CO(2)RR. A higher local pH can prevent the HER and promote C-C coupling to form C2+ products. Given the absence of CO3 2– and HCO3 – in the alkaline CORR system, Raman spectroscopy is unsuitable for evaluating the local pH. Therefore, we determined the local pH change using CV based on a recent study, where the local pH on the catalyst surface correlates closely with the initial oxidation potential of Cu (Fig. 2(h) and (i), Fig. S18) [45]. The calculated initial oxidation potentials of the three catalysts are very similar, with a ΔpH of approximately 0.17, indicating a similar local pH. This result aligns with the previously mentioned ECSA values, demonstrating that the local pH on the catalyst surface may be not the primary factor influencing selectivity differences. In summary, at this stage, the chemical valence state of Cu, the ECSA, and the local pH values have all been ruled out as factors accounting for the selectivity variations in CORR among the three Cu-based catalysts. The remaining possibilities lie in the intrinsic properties of the catalysts themselves. 3.4 Crystal surfaces and GBs To gain deeper insights into the intrinsic active sites of the catalysts, we conducted HRTEM characterizations of the catalysts after reaction. It is evident that a significant number of GBs are present in both Cu and CuO, except for Cu2O. (Figs. 3(a)–(c) , Figs. S19 and S20). This finding aligns with the FE differences in H2 and C2+ products illustrated in Figs. 1(a)–(c), where the selectivity for C2+ on Cu and CuO was markedly higher than that on Cu2O, while the HER exhibited an opposite trend. This finding is consistent with previous reports. More importantly, given that GBs have been well established to enhance the adsorption of *CO or *CHO and facilitate C-C coupling to generate C2+ products [46], we propose that GBs are indeed responsible for the increased C2+ selectivity in Cu and CuO (Figs. 1(d)–(f)). In contrast, the significant presence of isolated Cu nanoparticles in Cu2O likely leads to a higher energy barrier for C-C coupling (Fig. S21). To further investigate the selectivity differences between Cu and CuO, we analyzed the crystal plane composition of GBs based on HRTEM results. The images clearly demonstrate that these GBs are primarily comprised of Cu (100) and Cu (111) planes. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) analysis also confirms the presence of these crystal planes (Figs. 3(d)–(f)). To enhance our understanding of the crystal plane composition in different catalysts, we conducted crystal plane-sensitive OH- adsorption experiments (Figs. 3(g)–(i) and Fig. S22) [39,47]. The results indicated that Cu (100), Cu (110), and Cu (111) crystal planes are present in all catalysts (Fig. 3(g)). Notably, during the OH– adsorption experiments, we detected a new Cu (110) crystal plane in all three catalysts, which was not observed in HRTEM and SAED characterizations. This discrepancy may arise from the inherent instability of Cu (110), which might only be detectable during in situ OH– adsorption experiments [48]. To further determine the precise ratio of different crystal planes, we then performed peak fitting on the oxidation peak of the CV curve (Fig. 3(h)). It should be noted that only the proportion of Cu (110) among three catalysts is similar, thereby the difference in CORR performance might attribute to the presence of other crystal planes or GBs. In detail, for Cu and Cu2O, our preliminary analysis suggested that selectivity is largely influenced by the presence of numerous GBs (Fig. 3(a) and 3(c)). The fitting results indicated similar proportions of the three crystal planes (Cu (100), Cu (110), and Cu (111), which are 67.3%, 28.3%, and 4.4% for Cu and 68.3%, 25.4%, and 6.3% for Cu2O. In contrast, for Cu and CuO, the proportion of Cu (100) in Cu is significantly higher than in CuO, recorded at 67.3% and 52.4%, respectively, while the proportion of Cu (110) is similar: 28.3% for Cu and 27.4% for CuO (Fig. 3(i), Table S4). Based on the above findings, it seems that the proportion of Cu (100) crystal planes significantly affects the selectivity of C2+ products, which is consistent with previous reports [49]. Notably, considering that both exhibit numerous GBs in HRTEM characterization and that the FE for C2+ evolution on Cu is greater than that on CuO, we speculate that GBs dominated by Cu (100) likely represent the most effective active sites for CORR to produce C2+ products. To further validate the universality of our findings, we sought to determine whether the initial particle size of the catalysts influences the selectivity of CORR. Firstly, we investigated the CORR performance of smaller Cu2O nanoparticles (n-Cu2O, 32 nm) (Fig. S23), as compared to the sample (Cu2O, 700 nm) used in Fig. 1(c). The experiment showed that the H2 formation (FE <8%) is greatly suppressed significantly better than Cu2O (FE >17%) and almost identical to that of Cu (FE <7%) (Figs. 1(a) and (c), Fig. S24). Further HRTEM analysis revealed that the n-Cu2O particles exhibit distinct GBs (Fig. S25) as well as a similar proportion of Cu (100) crystal faces (61.8%) compared to Cu (67.3%) (Fig. S26, Table S4), except for a significant larger ECSA (42.1 cm2 ECSA) than Cu (21.9 cm2 ECSA) (Fig. S27, Table S3). This significant ECSA enhancement suggests the exposure of numerous active sites in n-Cu2O catalysts, which may potentially serve as the pivotal factor in promoting C2+ product formation. Therefore, it is vital to conduct research under identical mass transfer conditions to thoroughly investigate the dominant factors determining product distribution differences [49]. Keep this in mind, we examined the CORR performance of micrometer-Cu (m-Cu, 1μm) with a similar ECSA (24.1 cm2 ECSA) to Cu (21.9 cm2 ECSA) and Cu2O (23.9 cm2 ECSA) (Fig. S28, Table S3). Notably, the formation of H2 follows the order: Cu2O > m-Cu > Cu (Fig. S29). For both m-Cu and Cu2O, there are no GBs (Fig. 3(c), Fig. S30). However, OH- adsorption indicated a higher proportion of Cu (100) on m-Cu (74.5%) compared to that on Cu2O (68.3%) and Cu (67.3%) (Fig. 3(i), Fig. S31, Table S4). Given the same mass transfer, the lower H2 formation of m-Cu (> 12%) compared to Cu2O (> 17%) can be attributed to the lower C-C coupling energy barrier of Cu (100) [49,50], meanwhile the formation of H2 in m-Cu (>12%) is significantly higher than that in Cu (<7%) with rich GBs, again proves the crucial influence of GBs on product selectivity (Fig. 3(a), Fig. S30). In summary, the above analysis further proves our speculation that the GBs dominated by Cu (100) might be the most effective active sites for the evolution of C2+ products. 3.5 Mechanistic insights for CORR To probe the reaction intermediates and analysis the reaction pathway, we then conducted in situ ATR-SEIRAS measurements from OCP to –1.5 V vs. RHE after pre-reduction of the catalysts (Figs. 4(a)–(c) , Fig. S32). The peaks at 2063 and 1806 cm–1 correspond to the atop-adsorbed *CO (COatop) and bridge-adsorbed *CO (*CObridge) intermediates, which shift to 2050 and 1794 cm–1 due to the vibrational Stark effect, respectively. Such intermediates could be further protonated or undergo the C-C coupling process [51,52]. Additionally, the characteristic peak at 1368 cm–1 corresponds to ν(C–O) stretching vibrations of bridging-adsorbed *CHO intermediates, whereas the 1650 cm–1 signal originates from H–O–H bending modes of interfacial water molecules [53]. Remarkably, the formation of *OCCHO coupling intermediates was observed at 1438 and 1550 cm–1, which is crucial for the generation of C2+ products [53–55]. Previous studies have implied that both *CObridge and *COatop are possible reactive species in CO(2)RR, we found that the normalized *CObridge/*COatop ratio of Cu (2–4) is significantly higher than that of CuO (0.4–0.9) and Cu2O (< 0.4) in the same potential range (Fig. 4(d)). Interestingly, this result is consistent with the FE differences in H2 and C2+ shown in Figs. 1(a)–(c), where the selectivity for C2+ on Cu was significantly higher than that on CuO and Cu2O. This result suggests that the more enhanced *CObridge adsorption on Cu may contribute to the following C-C coupling process. Based on integrated HRTEM characterization and in situ infrared spectroscopic analysis, we computationally built three different interfaces: Cu (100)/Cu (100), Cu (100)/Cu (111), and Cu (111)/Cu (111), to explore the role of GBs and crystal planes in affecting the reaction pathway of CORR (Fig. S33). Considering the enhanced *CObridge adsorption on the Cu catalyst observed in our in-situ ATR-SEIRAS results (Fig. 4(d)), we firstly calculated the adsorption energy of *CObridge on the surface and interface, using Cu (100), Cu (111), Cu (100)/Cu (100), and Cu (111)/Cu (111) as examples. The adsorption energies were –0.254, –0.117, –0.334, and –0.35 eV, respectively (Table S5). The lower *CObridge adsorption energy at both interfaces suggest that the interface (representing GBs) own higher activity compared to the surface (representing crystal planes), consistent with previous CORR performance and HRTEM results shown in Figs. 1 and 3. To further reveal the influence of *CO adsorption configurations at GBs, we calculated the adsorption energies of *CObridge and *COatop on Cu (100)/Cu (100), Cu (100)/Cu (111), and Cu (111)/Cu (111) interfaces. The adsorption energies were –0.334, –0.353, and –0.350 eV for CObridge, and –0.254, –0.263, and –0.154 eV for COatop, respectively (Figs. 4(e), (f), Table S6). Firstly, the most significant result is that the adsorption energy of *CObridge is much lower than that of *COatop, regardless of the interface, implying easier adsorption on the catalyst surface. However, whether the adsorbed *CObridge contributes to the C-C coupling process remains unclear. Although previous studies have shown that the *CObridge is relatively inert compared to *COatop [41,56], recent studies have also demonstrated that the protonation process from *CObridge to *CHO is easier than that of *COatop [51,57,58]. Herein, we speculate whether *CObridge-derived *CHO could participate in the C-C coupling process. Indeed, numerous studies have proven the enhanced pathway of asymmetric C-C coupling (*CHO and *CO) to form C2+ products [2,59,60]. Notably, the in situ infrared detection of bridging-adsorbed *CHO and *OCCHO intermediates further validates our hypothesis. Therefore, we then calculated the free energy changes (ΔG) of asymmetric C-C coupling via *COatop and *CHO (*CO-derived) to form *OCCHO. The results showed that the ΔG on Cu (100)/Cu (100) interface (–0.424 eV) is significantly lower than that on Cu (111)/Cu (111) (–0.366 eV) and Cu (100)/Cu (111) (–0.243 eV), suggesting favorable thermodynamics of C2+ formation on Cu (100)/Cu (100) interface (Fig. 4(g), Table S7). These calculations verify the reaction pathway of asymmetric C-C coupling (via *CHO and *CO) to form C2+ products and further confirm our previous hypothesis that the GBs dominated by Cu (100) may be the most favorable actives sites for the evolution of C2+ products. To further investigate the interactions between catalyst and the adsorbed intermediates (*CO and *CHO) during asymmetric C-C coupling process, we visualized Cu (100)/Cu (100), Cu (100)/Cu (111), and Cu (111)/Cu (111) interfaces with the adsorbed intermediates via differential charge density and electron localization function analysis (Fig. S34). It was observed that electrons appear to transfer from Cu atoms to *CO and *CHO. We also quantified the electron transfer by Bader charge analysis to characterize their adsorption strength. As shown in Fig. S35 and Table S8, the electron transfer number to *CO + *CHO configuration from Cu (100)/Cu (100) (0.496 e) and Cu (100)/Cu (111) (0.493 e) interfaces is larger than that from the Cu (111)/Cu (111) (0.432 e) interface. This finding suggests that the *CO + *CHO configuration exhibits stronger adsorption at the interface composed of Cu (100), thereby promoting the formation of the key intermediate *OCCHO. Consequently, the above analysis further proves our opinion that the Cu (100)-dominated GBs are more favorable for the asymmetric C-C coupling process to produce C2+ products, which also aligns well with our experimental results. 4 Conclusions In summary, we benchmarked three typical commercial Cu-based catalysts (Cu, CuO and Cu2O) with different valence states for CO electrolysis using a zero-gap MEA electrolyzer. More importantly, our analysis is based on uniform mass transfer conditions for different types of copper catalysts. Among them, only the Cu catalyst achieved FE of C2+ products exceeding 85% within the current density range of 100–500 mA cm–2 and maintained a stable C2+ FE of 87.66 ± 0.80% for over 110 h at a current density of 200 mA cm–2. Control experiments ruled out the influence of Cu chemical valence state, ECSA, and local pH as factors accounting for the selectivity variations among three Cu-based catalysts. Furthermore, HRTEM and OH- adsorptions results revealed that Cu (100)-dominated GBs maybe the most favorable active sites, meanwhile in situ SEIRAS and DFT calculations indicated that the asymmetric C-C coupling (via *CHO and *CO) is the most probable reaction pathway for forming C2+ products on GBs dominated by Cu (100). These findings provide new insights into the design of efficient Cu-based catalysts and offer guidance for the industrial-scale application of CO(2)RR in the future.

        "dc:description": "Copper (Cu)-based catalysts show significant potential for producing high value-added C2+ products in electrocatalytic CO2/CO reduction reactions (CO(2)RR). However, the structural reconfiguration during operation poses substantial challenges in identifying the intrinsic catalytic active site, especially under similar mass transport conditions. Herein, three typical and commercial Cu-based catalysts (Cu, CuO, and Cu2O) are chosen as representatives to elucidate the structure-activity relationship of CORR in the membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer. Notably, only the Cu catalyst demonstrates the most suppression of hydrogen evolution reaction, thus achieving the highest FE of 86.7% for C2+ products at a current density of 500 mA cm–2 and maintaining a stable electrolysis over 110 h at a current of 200 mA cm–2. The influence of chemical valence state of Cu, electrochemical surface area, and local pH were firstly investigated and ruled out for the significant FE differences. Finally, based on the structure analysis from high resolution transmission electron microscope, OH– adsorption, in situ infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, it is suggested that the asymmetric C-C coupling (via *CHO and *CO) is the most probable reaction pathway for forming C2+ products, with Cu (100)-dominant grain boundaries (GBs) being the most favorable active sites. These findings provide deeper insights into the synergistic relationship between crystal facets and GBs in electrocatalytic systems.",
