The efficient catalytic oxidation of nitrogen-containing volatile organic compounds remains a big challenge due to unmanaged production of harmful byproducts. Herein, a series of Cu-Mn modified hierarchical SAPO-34 zeolite catalysts with different pore structures were synthesized for n-butylamine oxidation. The physicochemical properties and catalytic performance of catalysts were investigated and analyzed in detail. Among them, CuMn/S-1 shows the highest activity (T 90 = 279 °C, GHSV = 12,000 h−1), which is attributed to its higher porosity, higher surface acidity and superior reducibility. Meanwhile, it is found that the hierarchical structure and mesopore play an important role in improvement of N2 selectivity. Meanwhile, CuMn/S-1 also exhibits high stability and water resistance. The catalytic mechanism of n-butylamine on CuMn/SAPO-34 was investigated by in situ DRIFTS, showing that propanol, methanol and acetate are the main intermediates.

VOCs have the characteristics of easy diffusion, toxicity and volatility which can cause series damage to atmospheric environment and public health. Therefore, the efficient removal of VOCs has attracted popular attention in recent years. Various VOCs removal methods have been explored, including adsorption, condensation, membrane separation, biodegradation, non-thermal plasma oxidation, photocatalytic decomposition, thermal incineration and (thermal) catalytic oxidation [2–6]. Among them, catalytic oxidation can be regarded as one of the most effective technologyies due to its high efficiency, low cost, less secondary pollutants, and lower working temperature. In comparison to aliphatic/aromatic hydrocarbons or oxygen-containing volatile organic compounds (OVOCs), nitrogen-containing volatile organic compounds (NVOCs), such as amines, amides, nitro and nitrile compounds, have stronger odor and toxicity. Moreover, NVOCs can be inhaled by the human body in the form of gas or enter the human body through skin contact, posing a serious threat to human health [7]. Among them, n-butylamine, as a typical kind of NVOCs, is widely used in the petrochemical and pharmaceutical industries. So far, the efficient and environmental-friendly catalytic combustion for n-butylamine still remains a big challenge due to unmanaged production of harmful nitrogen-containing byproducts, including amide, NOx and so on. Some researchers have made efforts to enhance N2 selectivity in recent years. On one hand, it is found that hierarchical porous catalyst shows low NOx yield and high N2 selectivity during n-butylamine oxidation process. Because the hierarchical porous structure of catalyst can improve the product diffusion and inhibit the formation of byproducts which are oxidized excessively. For instance, Ma et al. synthesized a series of SBA-15 and SiO2 with different specific surface area and porosity as Pd-based catalyst supports and found that the large specific surface area and high porosity of the catalyst play a key role in NOX formation control [8,9]. Chen et al. prepared a series of ZSM-5 sieves with different pore structures and also proved that the higher porosity can benefit the diffusion of NH3 and inhibit its further oxidation to NOx [10]. On the other hand, Cu-based catalysts have been developed for NVOC oxidation due to their high N2 selectivity. Xing et al. proposed a novel idea that Cu sites can be regarded as selective catalytic reduction (SCR) sites to improve N2 selectivity [11]. In this work, Cu0.4Mg2.6AlO showed the best catalytic activity, with 100% conversion of n-butylamine and 83% N2 selectivity at 350 °C due to dominant weak acidity and oligomeric Cu–O–Cu species driving absorption of NH2 * species and oxidation to N2. Meanwhile, in NH3-SCR reaction, the Cu0.4Mg2.6AlO catalyst exhibited the relatively high NO conversion (79%) and N2 selectivity (95%) at 270 °C. Ma et al. developed a core-shell CuO/Pd@SiO2 catalyst with different functional active sites for n-butylamine catalytic oxidation. And high N2 selectivity of 98.3% can be achieved over the catalysts at 260 °C [12]. The Cu-based catalysts are extensively used for the catalytic oxidation of other types of NVOCs in recent years. Zhang et al. [7] prepared a series of X/SBA-15 (X = Pt, Pd, Cu, Co, Fe, V, Ag, and Mn) catalysts, and the activity order of these catalysts for acetonitrile oxidation (CH3CN) is as follows: Pt/SBA-15 > Pd/SBA-15 > Cu/SBA-15 > Co/SBA-15 > Fe/SBA-15 > V/SBA-15 > Ag/SBA-15 > Mn/SBA-15 > SBA-15. Although Pt/SBA-15 and Pd/SBA-15 catalysts have superior catalytic activity, Cu/SBA-15 exhibits better N2 selectivity than Pt/SBA-15 and Pd/SBA-15. Complete conversion of CH3CN and about 80% N2 selectivity can be achieved at 350 °C over Cu/SBA-15. He et al. [13] prepared modified CuO/ZSM-5 catalysts for catalytic oxidation of diethylamine (DEA) by changing the addition order of CeO2 and CuO. They found that the introduction of CeO2 could significantly change the geometry and electronic state of CuO active center in the catalyst, producing more active Cu species and highly dispersed CuO on the catalyst surface which can lead to excellent catalytic performance. Xing et al. [14] have synthesized Cu/ZSM-5 catalysts with different CuO particle sizes (3, 6, 9, and 12 nm). Their catalytic activity for N, N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) oxidation increases with the increase of CuO particle size. Cu-12 nano catalyst has the highest catalytic activity and can achieve complete conversion of DMF at 300 °C. Cu-6 nano catalyst shows the highest N2 selectivity (300 °C, 95%) at lower temperatures due to the free Cu2+ and weak acidic sites. However, Cu based catalysts show unsatisfactory n-butylamine conversion at low temperature range, that cause larger energy consumption. For example, Xing et al. synthesized a Cu/SAPO-34 catalyst for n-butylamine combustion withT 50 and T 90 at 275 °C and 330 °C, respectively (GSHV = 12000 h−1) [15]. Zhang et al. prepared Cu/SBA-15 catalyst by impregnation method, CH3CN can be completely removed when the reaction temperature is higher than 350 °C (GSHV = 20000 h−1) [7]. Therefore, the combination of Cu sites and other strong oxidation sites can simultaneously improve NVOC conversion and N2 selectivity. Mn based catalysts show satisfactory catalytic activity in the catalytic combustion of other kinds of VOCs. Li et al. synthesized MnO2/LaMnO3 catalyst treated using acidic KMnO4 solution with LaMnO3 perovskite as precursor for toluene oxidation [16]. Compared with LaMnO3, MnO2/LaMnO3 catalyst has higher catalytic activity which is owing to its high concentration of Mn4+, large surface area, rich surface oxygen species and superior low-temperature reducibility. Ma et al. prepared a series of metal oxide based monolithic catalysts M/Al2O3/COR (M=Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) for EA oxidation [17]. Among them, Mn/Al2O3/COR exhibits the highest activity due to its abundant active oxygen species (T50 = 220 °C; T90 = 236 °C), and Mn/Al2O3/COR also exhibits good stability and water resistance, making it a promising industrial VOCs oxidation catalyst. It is worth noting that Cu/SAPO-34 catalyst is largely popular in NH3-SCR reaction, which is attributed to the adjusted acidity, high hydrothermal stability, and low price of SAPO-34 zeolite. He et al. synthesized two groups of Cu-SAPO-34 with different copper content used in NH3-SCR reaction, two samples of which with Cu content of 0.05 show relatively excellent NO conversion ability and high N2 selectivity (above 99%) in the range of 100–450 °C [18]. Wang et al. loaded a small amount of Ce on Cu/SAPO-34, and found that the hydrothermal stability of Cu/SAPO-34 catalyst in NH3-SCR reaction was significantly improved because Ce3+ can fill the defect sites on surface to reduce acidity and improve structural stability [19,20]. Therefore, the application prospects of SAPO-34 molecular sieves in the oxidation of NVOCs is worth exploring. Considering the advantage of hierarchical pore structure in NVOC oxidation, it can be inferred that Cu-Mn modified hierarchical SAPO-34 zeolite catalysts possess superior catalytic performance in n-butylamine oxidation. As far as we know, no hierarchical SAPO-34 zeolite catalysts for NVOC oxidation have been reported so far. Herein, a series of Cu-Mn modified hierarchical SAPO-34 zeolite catalysts with different pore structures were synthesized for n-butylamine oxidation. The physiochemical properties of the catalyst were characterized by XRD, XRF, BET, SEM, TEM, H2-TPR, NH3-TPD and XPS. The catalytic performances were studied and the structure-activity relationship of catalysts were analyzed in detail. The key intermediates and reaction mechanism of CuMn/SAPO-34 catalyst for n-butylamine was speculated via in situ DRIFTS. This work provides theoretical foundation and experiment evidence for NVOC catalytic combustion. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Preparation of hierarchical SAPO-34 The hierarchical SAPO-34 supports with different pore structure were synthesized by hydrothermal method. Typically, x g (x = 0, 0.46, 0.92, and 1.84) of polyethylene glycol-2000 (PEG-2000) was dissolved in 50 g of deionized water under stirring. Then, 3 g of pseudo boehmite (AlOOH) was added into above solution. After stirring for 0.5 h, 5.33 g of phosphoric acid (H3PO4) and 2.95 g of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) were added successively, and the mixture was stirred for another 0.5 h. Subsequently, 8.27 g of triethylamine (TEA) was added. Finally, the mixture was moved to a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated in an oven at 200 °C for 72 h. The products were filtered and washed with deionized water, and the obtained sample was dried at 110 °C before the calcination treatment (600 °C for 6 h to remove the template). According to the amount of PEG-2000 used (x = 0, 0.46, 0.92, and 1.84), the supports were recorded as S-0, S-1, S-2 and S-4 respectively. 2.2 Preparation of CuMn/SAPO-34 catalysts CuMn/SAPO-34 catalysts were prepared by an impregnation method. Typically, 0.2 g of copper nitrate (Cu(NO3)2) and 0.3 g of manganese nitrate (Mn(NO3)2) were dissolved in 10 mL of deionized water. Then, 2 g of supports was added into the mixed solution. After being stirred for 30 min, the samples were dried at 100 °C overnight and calcinated at 400 °C for 2 h. The CuMn/SAPO-34 catalysts were denoted as CuMn/S-y (y = 0, 1, 2, and 4). 2.3 Characterization methods The structural parameters including the specific surface area, pore volume, pore size distribution and average pore size of the samples were obtained from N2 adsorption-desorption measurements using an SSA-6000 analyzer (Builder, China). Before test, the samples were pretreated at 300 °C for 2 h under vacuum. The crystalline phase of the sample was studied by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, PANalytical, Netherlands) with Cu Kα Radiation(45 kV and 40 mA) in the range of 2θ at 10–80°. The element content of the samples was determined by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF). The micro morphologies of samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JEOL-7800 F) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, TECNAI G2 F30). The hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) were carried out on PCA-1200 (Builder, China) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Specifically, for H2-TPR, 50 mg of sample was pretreated with a N2 flow (30 mL/min) at 300 °C for 30 min. Then, the sample was heated from room temperature to 600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min in a flow of 5% H2/Ar (30 mL/min). For NH3-TPD, 0.1 g of catalyst was pretreated with a N2 flow (30 mL/min) at 300 °C for 30 min. After cooling to 100 °C, the samples were treated under 2.01 vol% NH3/N2 flow (30 mL/min) for 30 min. To remove physically adsorbed NH3, the sample was purged with a N2 flow (40 mL/min) at 100 °C for 30 min. Finally, the temperature was increased from 100 °C to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min and the patterns were recorded at the same time. The Fourier Transform Infrared Resolution (FT-IR) patterns were obtained from the Bruker tensor 37 infrared spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) in the range of 300–4000 cm−1. The valence state of Mn and Cu were analyzed by X-ray electron spectroscopy (XPS) using an AXIS ULtrabld instrument (Kratos, UK) with Mg-Kα radiation (հυ = 1253.6 eV). The binding energies (B.E.) of the elements were calibrated by the C 1 s peak at 284.8 ev. The in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was performed by Bruker tensor 37 infrared spectrometer, which was equipped with MCT detector and cooled with liquid N2. 50 mg of catalyst was pretreated in a N2 flow (60 mL/min) at 350 °C for 1 h to remove surface impurities. When the temperature was decreased to 40 °C, the background spectra were obtained at each temperature point under N2 atmosphere. subsequently, a mixture gas of 20 vol% O2/80 vol% Ar containing 1000 ppm n-butylamine was introduced, and IR spectra were recorded in the range of 4000–1000 cm−1 with 64 scans. 2.4 Catalytic performance test The catalytic activity of prepared materials for n-butylamine catalytic combustion was performed in a continuous flow fixed-bed quartz tube reactor using 0.2 g of catalyst (40–60 mesh) at atmospheric pressure. The n-butylamine concentration at inlet and outlet was detected by on-line gas chromatograph (GC-9890E, Linghua, China). The catalyst was exposed to a typical stream ([n-butylamine] = ∼1000 ppm, [O2] = 20 vol% and [Ar] = 80 vol%), and the total flow rate was 200 mL/min with a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) at 12,000 h−1. N2O, NO and NO2 concentrations at the outlet were measured by a gas analyzer (PN-200, Penglei, China). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 structural properties and morphology Fig. 1 A shows the XRD patterns of CuMn/SAPO-34 catalysts obtained under the same crystallization conditions. All the samples exhibit characteristic peaks at 9.54°, 12.97°, 16.08°, 20.7°, 23.17°, 25.12°, 26.12°, 26.71°, 30.81° and 31.27°, which is attributed to typical SAPO-34 (PDF #47–0429), indicating that the introduction of Cu and Mn did not induce a significant effect on the crystal structure of samples. The characteristic peaks of copper oxides and manganese oxides are not found in the XRD patterns due to the high dispersion of copper oxides and manganese oxides on the surface of support SAPO-34 [21]. The XRF test results in Table 1 show that Cu and Mn are indeed loaded on support SAPO-34, and the Cu/Mn ratio is between 1.1 and 1.2, which are close to theoretical content. Fig. 1B-D show the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distribution of synthesized CuMn/SAPO-34 catalysts. From Table 1, it can be concluded that after loading copper manganese oxides, the specific surface area and pore volume of catalysts decrease due to that the micropores of supports are blocked by the loaded copper manganese oxides [22]. Fig. 1B shows that the mesopores size of CuMn/SAPO-34 catalysts are mainly concentrated at 3–5 nm. The mesopore size of catalysts is smaller than that of corresponding supports, indicating that the partial active sites have been introduced into mesopores [23]. Among all catalysts, CuMn/S-1 sample has the highest mesopores volume, and the mesopore volume is 0.19 cm3/g. Fig. S1A shows the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of SAPO-34 support. The adsorption capacity of all isotherms rises rapidly at P/P 0 < 0.1, which reflects the existence of micropores on SAPO-34 [24]. As shown in Table S1, the introduction of template PEG-2000 results in slightly decrease in surface area. However, from Fig. S1B, it can be observed that the addition of template PEG-2000 can introduce mesoporous successfully. And the order of the mesoporous volume of the supports is as follows: S-1 (0.14 cm3/g) > S-4 (0.11 cm3/g) ≈ S-2 (0.10 cm3/g) > S-0 (0.07 cm3/g). The morphology of prepared samples can be observed through SEM, and the images are presented in Fig. 2a-d. All the samples show well-dispersed cubic-like morphology with the size of ∼ 2 µm. Fig. 2e-g show the TEM images of CuMn/S-1 catalyst. From Fig. 2e and f, it can be seen that the loaded copper manganese oxides with the diameter of about 30 nm were well dispersed on the surface of support. Therefore, there are no characteristic peaks related to metal copper oxides and manganese oxides detected in the XRD patterns. In Fig. 2e, the lattice fringe spacings observed are 0.24, 0.30, 0.31 and 0.37 nm, which are corresponding to the (111) crystal faces of CuO [25], (112) crystal faces of Mn3O4 [26], (310) crystal faces of MnO2 [27] and (211) crystal faces of Mn2O3 [28], respectively. 3.2 Reducibility and acidity The H2-TPR patterns of the CuMn/SAPO-34 catalysts are displayed in Fig. 3 A. The reduction peaks of four catalysts are between 250 and 320 °C, and the reduction peaks of Cu2+ → Cu0 and Mn4+ → Mn3+ → Mn2+ are overlapped at 239–330 °C [26]. Cleary, the CuMn/S-1 sample shows two reduction peaks at 258 °C and 316 °C, respectively. CuMn/S-0, CuMn/S-2 and CuMn/S-4 samples only present one reduction peak at 304 °C, 294 °C and 301 °C, respectively. It can be concluded that CuMn/S-1 possesses better reducibility than that of other catalysts. Moreover, the amount of H2 consumption of CuMn/SAPO-34 catalysts follow the order: CuMn/S-1 (1.99 mmol/g) > CuMn/S-0 (1.95 mmol/g) = CuMn/S-2 (1.95 mmol/g) = CuMn/S-4 (1.92 mmol/g). In conclusion, CuMn/S-1 sample has the best reducibility based on the lowest reduction temperature and the largest hydrogen consumption. The acidity of the CuMn/SAPO-34 samples was determined by NH3-TPD. As shown in Fig. 3B, all samples exhibit two desorption peaks. The peak below 280 °C is denoted as NH3 desorption from weak acid sites, and the peak above 280 °C is attributed to NH3 desorption from strong acid sites [29]. The acidity of samples is expressed in terms of the amount of NH3 adsorbed, as shown in Table 2. And the total acidity of samples follows this order: CuMn/S-4 (182.40 μmol/g) > CuMn/S-1 (177.24 μmol/g) > CuMn/S-0 (171.72 μmol/g) > CuMn/S-2 (162.84 μmol/g). 3.3 Surface elemental valence states To investigate the valence state of surface elements on the prepared samples, XPS analyses were carried out. Fig. 4 shows the Mn 2p and Cu 2p XPS spectra of prepared samples. The Mn 2p peak can be split into two peaks, which are Mn 2p3/2 (640–650 eV) and Mn 2p1/2 (640–650 eV). And Mn 2p3/2 can be divided into four peaks, corresponding to Mn2+ species at 638.2 eV, Mn3+ species at 641.2 eV, Mn4+ species at 642.7 eV, and the satellite peak at 647 eV, respectively [30]. The content of Mn species with different state is calculated and shown in Table 2. And the Mn4+ content of CuMn/SAPO-34 catalysts are followed this order: CuMn/S-1 (46.3%) > CuMn/S-2 (45.5%) > CuMn/S-0 (25.2%) > CuMn/S-4 (23.0%). CuMn/S-1 has the highest Mn4+ content, so its H2 consumption below 300 °C is higher than that of others in H2-TPR [31]. Cu XPS spectra can be fitted with Cu 2p3/2 (933.5–936 eV) and Cu 2p1/2 (953.5–956 eV). Two satellite peaks of CuO appeared at 941–945 eV and 962–963 eV are attributed to the Cu2+ species with d9 electronic configuration, which shows that copper species on the catalyst surface mainly exist in the form of Cu2+ [32]. 3.4 Catalytic performance The n-butylamine conversion as a function of temperature for the prepared catalysts was measured, and the results are shown in Fig. 5 A. The conversion of n-butylamine increases as the reaction temperature rises, and 100% n-butylamine conversion can be achieved over all catalysts within 320 °C. The T 20 , T 50 and T 90 (temperature obtained at 20%, 50% and 90% conversion) of CuMn/S-0, CuMn/S-1, CuMn/S-2 and CuMn/S-4 catalysts are summarized in Table 3. According to T 90 , the activity performance of CuMn/SAPO-34 catalysts follow the order of CuMn/S-1 > CuMn/S-0 > CuMn/S-4 > CuMn/S-2, which is consistent with the order of pore volume. The results show that higher porosity indeed benefits the dispersion of active sites and improves the diffusion of n-butylamine and intermediates [12]. Among them, CuMn/S-1 catalyst shows higher activities for n-butylamine degradation than that of others, whose T 50 and T 90 are 262 °C and 279 °C, respectively. Noticeably, CuMn/S-4 and CuMn/S-1 exhibit higher activity than that of others in low temperature range (< 250 °C), which is benefited from their stronger acidity. Because acid sites can enhance n-butylamine adsorption [33]. However, with increase of temperature, CuMn/S-0 and CuMn/S-1 shows superior activity due to their stronger reducibility. The relationships between activity and total acidity, amount of H2 consumption are displayed in Fig. 5 C,D. It can be concluded that acidity and reducibility are the key factors determining catalytic activity in low and high temperature range, respectively. Generally, CuMn/S-1 possesses the highest n-butylamine catalytic activity due to its abundant porosity, high surface acidity and superior reducibility. The stability of CuMn/S-1 catalyst during n-butylamine catalytic combustion process was tested at 300 °C for 600 min and the results are showed in Fig. 5B. The n-butylamine conversion remains above 90% within 600 min without significant downward trend, indicating that CuMn/S-1 has good stability and can be considered as a promising catalyst for industrial application. As shown in Fig. S2, the water resistance of the CuMn/S-1 was also tested at 300 °C in the presence of 2 vol% water vapor for 600 min, and the conversion rate remained stable above 90%, indicating good water resistance of the catalyst. Fig. S3A-C show the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distribution of Cu-Mn/S-1 after stability test. It can be seen the hierarchical structure is still maintained after long-term reaction, but the surface area of catalyst decreases because of the collapse of pores (Table S2). Fig. 5E shows the Mn 2p XPS spectra of CuMn/S-1 catalyst before and after the stability test. It can be seen that the content of Mn4+ in CuMn/S-1 decreases from 46.3% to 38.5% after long-term reaction, indicating that Mn4+ species have participated in the catalytic oxidation reaction process of n-butylamine, indicating the good reducibility derived from large amount of Mn4+ species of CuMn/S-1 leads to its remarkable activity. FT-IR spectra of CuMn/S-1 before and after stability test are shown in Fig. 5 F. The band at 480 cm−1 can be attributed to the [SiO4] tetrahedron stretching vibration, which indicates that Si atoms are incorporated into the SAPO-34 framework. The band near 640 cm−1 is the characteristic peak of the double six-membered ring stretching vibration. Vibration bands at 720 cm−1 and 1100 cm−1 are attributed to the asymmetric/symmetric stretch of O-P-O bounds. The band centered at 1640 cm−1 is the signature of the physically adsorbed water, and the obvious vibration at about 3450 cm−1 is assigned to the stretching of bridging hydroxyl group, including the Si-OH-Al (Brønsted acid site) and the internal P-OH and Si-OH (Lewis acid site) [34–36]. After stability test, no bands assigned to coke deposited can be observed, meaning no coke formed during long-term reaction [37–39]. The N2 selectivity of prepared CuMn/SAPO-34 catalysts are shown in Fig. 6A. Compared with other catalysts using micro-mesoporous composite SAPO-34 as the supports, the N2 selectivity of CuMn/S-0 below 300 °C is significantly lower than that of others, indicating that the hierarchical structure can indeed improve the N2 selectivity. It is obvious that CuMn/S-1 and CuMn/S-4 show higher N2 selectivity at T 50 and T 90 (Fig. 6B，C), which illustrates that mesopores play a significant role in improving N2 selectivity, owing to rich pores that can accelerate the diffusion of nitrogen-containing micro molecules and reduce their oxidation on the catalyst. Only N2O and NO are generated during the whole catalytic oxidation process, and their selectivity is shown in Fig. 6D and Fig. S4. The concentration of N2O which is the main product during n-butylamine combustion process has the significant influence on the N2 selectivity. When temperature is below 300 °C, a large amount of N2O is produced over CuMn/S-0 due to the lack of mesopores, which is not conducive to the diffusion of nitrogen-containing micro molecules and leads to their overoxidation on catalysts. As the temperature rises (> 300 °C), CuMn/S-1 and CuMn/S-4 shows inferior N2 selectivity, because their strong acidity can absorb NHx tightly and further result in a large amount of N2O generated. Meanwhile, the effect of molecular diffusion become negligible at high temperature range. The concentration of NO is relatively lower during n-butylamine combustion process (Fig. S4). Moreover, CuMn/S-1 also possesses fairly satisfactory N2 selectivity, and Cu-Mn bimetallic oxides catalysts supported by micro-mesoporous composite SAPO sieves can be considered as promising catalytic materials for n-butylamine catalytic combustion. Moreover, the comparison of catalytic performance of CuMn/SAPO-34 with the similar catalysts in other publications is shown in Table S3. In comparison to other catalysts, CuMn/SAPO-34 shows acceptable catalytic activity and excellent N2 selectivity which reaches up to 99% under the condition of the same space velocity and higher pollutant concentration. 3.5 Byproducts and reaction mechanism Some byproducts produced during n-butylamine oxidation process of CuMn/S-1 catalyst were tested by gas chromatography. Fig. 7A shows the concentration of byproducts at different temperature points. It can be seen that the by-products detected by gas chromatography are mainly propanol, ethanol and methanol. And the concentration of byproducts increases first and then decreases with the rise of temperature. When the temperature reaches up to 300 °C, the concentration of byproducts is very low, indicating n-butylamine can be completely mineralized over CuMn/S-1 at 300 °C. The in situ DRIFTS of CuMn/S-1 and CuMn/S-2 for n-butylamine oxidation are shown in Fig. 7B, C. For CuMn/S-1, The vibration peaks on 1590, 1139, and 1462 cm−1 are assigned to the vibration of NHx of n-butylamine (δ(NH)), alcohols (v(C-O)), CH2 (δ(CH)) [40–42], respectively. The bands at 1490, 1529, and 1553 cm−1 are due to the acetate species [11]. The bands at 1400 and 1626 cm−1 is attributed to the vibration of NHx molecules adsorbed on L-acid sites, and the bands at 3000–2800 cm−1 can be assigned to vibration of -CH (υ(CH)) of n-butylamine [7,40,43]. As the temperature increases, the intensity of bands at 1590, 1462, and 2800–3000 cm−1 become weak gradually and disappear eventually, indicating that n-butylamine was totally degraded at 160 °C. The appearance of band at 1626 cm−1 indicates that the C-N bond breaks first to form C4H9•, and the intensity of bands due to alcohol and carboxylate gradually increases, indicating that C4H9• species can be further converted to alcohol and acetate. Based on the above results, the mechanism of n-butylamine destruction over CuMn/S-1 can be proposed and shown in Fig. 7D. The C-N bond of n-butylamine is broken first, and then the NHx species are oxidized and transformed to N2O, N2, NO. Meanwhile, C4H9·is converted into alcohol and acetate which can be oxidized to CO2 and H2O finally. As shown in Fig. 7B,C, it can be concluded that the reaction pathways and main intermediates for CuMn/S-1 and CuMn/S-2 are similar. However, the band at 1590 cm−1 on CuMn/S-2 disappears when the temperature reaches up to 180 °C, and the intensity of 1462 and 2800–3000 cm−1 peaks shows negligible decline, indicating the catalytic activity of CuMn/S-2 is lower than that of CuMn/S-1. Moreover, the peak intensity of carboxylate is very weak, indicating intermediates are more difficult to be mineralized on CuMn/S-2. 4 Conclusions In this work, a series of CuMn/SAPO-34 catalysts with different pore structures and acidities were successfully fabricated for n-butylamine catalytic oxidation. Among them, CuMn/S-1 shows the highest catalytic activity with T 90 at 279 °C benefited from its high porosity, superior low temperature reducibility and strong acidity. The activity test shows that the acidic sites could enhance the adsorption of n-butylamine at low temperature (< 250 °C) to improve the catalytic activity. As the temperature increases, catalysts with stronger reducibility exhibit better activity, and reducibility becomes the key factor determining catalytic activity at high temperature. In addition, CuMn/SAPO-34 catalysts have great N2 selectivity due to the hierarchical structure, but the high acidity of the samples is the reason for the decrease in N2 selectivity at high temperatures (> 300 °C). Moreover, the byproducts and intermediates during n-butylamine catalytic oxidation process over CuMn/SAPO-34 catalysts were studied. It can be elucidated that C-N bond of n-butylamine breaks first on samples to form C4H9• species which can be further oxidized to alcohol and acetate species. The conversion of n-butylamine and mineralization rate of intermediates can be accelerated over CuMn/S-1, which is intrinsic reason for superior catalytic performance of CuMn/S-1. To sum up, Cu-Mn bimetallic oxides catalysts supported by hierarchical SAPO-34 sieves with adjustable porosity and acidity are materials which are worthy of being explored for NVOC catalytic oxidation. In the future, it is hoped that the catalytic temperature for n-butylamine oxidation can be further reduced to save energy, and its application prospects in catalytic oxidation of other kinds or mixed NVOCs can be explored.
