SOBCZAK, JOSEF J. ZIOLKOWSKI Institute of Chemistry, University of Wroctuw, 50-383 Wroctaw (Poland) and LI WAN Beijing Polytechnical University, Beijing (China) (Received October 17, 1988; accepted January 25, 1989) Introduction In the past decade, a growing interest in rare earth metals as reagents and catalysts in many organic reactions has been observed [1]. Application of rare earth metal compounds as catalysts in olefin epoxidation and allyl alcohol reactions are well known [2]. Until now, the molybdenum com- plexes have been known as the most effective homogeneous catalysts for the epoxidation of olefins with organic hydroperoxides [3]. However it seemed interesting to examine the activity and selectivity of bimetallic systems composed of a rare earth and molybdenum in epoxida- tion reaction of olefins. In earlier studies, we found that the Mo(V) dimeric complex, HiEMOiO^CiO^O^HaO^l-SHiO acts in homogeneous [4] and heterogenized [5] systems as a very selective olefin epoxidation catalyst. In this paper, we report that new complexes have been prepared by mixing MCIa (M = Eu-'-3, Sm-1-3, Y-1-3) with H^Mozt^^t^^HiO);] (I) or its disodium salt in aqueous solution. The reaction products were isolated as M2[Mo204(C204)2(H20)2]3, (II) water-insoluble solids. Part of the reaction products remains in solution as a water soluble complex, most probably of formula M[Mo204(C204)2(H20)2]Cl, (III). Complexes of formula (II) were tested in cyclohexene epoxidation with cumene hydroperoxide and the results compared with those in which only complex (I) was used. Results and discussion Kinetic curves describing cumene hydroperoxide consumption and epoxide formation in cyclohexene epoxidation are presented on Figs. 1 and 2 for reactions catalyzed by (II) and (I) respectively. From the results pre- sented, one may conclude that the bimetallic catalysts containing Eu\"1\"3 and Sm\"*\"3 are more active, showing no induction time. 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands L2 60 80 103 120 140 t/[m i n] Fig. l.

Figure 3 shows the selectivity of epoxide formation with time (calcu- lated per hydroperoxide used) for bimetallic systems (II), compared with those of complex (I) containing molybdenum only. The positive effect of rare earth metal ions is seen in the very high and long-lived selectivity for the epoxidation reaction, especially for Eu- and Sm- containing catalysts. An explanation of this interesting experimental fact will be the subject of further studies. Experimental Preparations M2[Mo204(C204)2(H20)2]3 complexes (II) (where M = Eu\", Sm\", Y\"1\"3) were prepared according to following procedure. To a stirred solution of MCl3 (M = Y, Sm, Eu) in water (1.3 mmol m 15 ml) was added an aqueous solution of Na2[Mo204(C204)2(H20)2]-3H20 (2 mmol in 50 ml) and stirred for 0.5 h. During this time a light orange-brown solid deposited. The precipi- tate was filtered off, washed with water and dried over P20s (yield : 36 - 46%). The filtrate was chromatographed on a Cationite SP 1080 (Merck) column using 0.5 M HC104. Yellow-orange solutions of cationic complexes, probably M[Mo204(C204)2(H20)2]\"1\" were obtained (compounds were not L4 isolated). Ha 1^0204(0204)2(1120)2]'SH^O and its sodium salt were pre- pared according to the literature method [5, 6]. EuCl3, SmCIs and Yd 3 of commercial purity (Schuchardt and Merck) were used. Epoxidation reaction The catalytic activity of (II) was tested m the epoxidation of cyclo- hexene (0.5 M) with cumene hydroperoxide (0.1 M) in chlorobenzene at 80 C in argon atmosphere. The catalyst (II) concentration was lO\"3 M. The catalytic activity of (I) in the same reaction conditions was deter- mined and compared with that of complexes (II). The reaction products, epoxide, and unreacted hydroperoxide were analyzed as described earlier [7]. References 1 P. Girard, R. Couffignal and H. B. Kagan, Tetrahedron Lett., (1981) 3959; M. P.
