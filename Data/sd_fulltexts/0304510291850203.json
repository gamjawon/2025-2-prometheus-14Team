McCoy and Michael F. Farona* Department of Chemistry, The University of Akron, Akron, OH 44325 (USA.) (Received July 5, 1990; accepted October 19, 1990) Abstract The mechanism for the initiation of olefin metathesis over the heterogeneous catalyst rhenium heptoxide on y-alumina was studied, using a pulse catalytic microreactor. Of the currently proposed mechanisms for initial metal-carbene formation, only that which requires the reactant olefin to contain an allylic hydrogen, and proceeds by way of a 7rallyl complex, predicts the first-formed olefins found in the product mixture. A critical test using isotopically labeled ethylene showed that ethylene did not self-initiate metathesis, but readily metathesize& after the catalyst was activated with cis-2-pentene. Introduction It is established that the propagation of the olefin metathesis reaction proceeds through metallacarbene-metallacyclobutane intermediates. Homogeneous catalysts normally use alkyl-containing compounds which can, by several means, lead to the initiating metal-alkylidene compound. However, heterogeneous catalysts are active without the concurrent use of a cocatalyst; this indicates that the initially formed coordinated carbene must come from the olefin. Depending on the method of formation of the first-formed carbene, the first-formed olefins can be different from the normal metathesis products. Examination of the nature of the first-formed products, which should be present in catalytic amounts, can provide insight into the mechanism of formation of the initiating carbene. Several processes have been suggested, or can be envisaged, by which a heterogeneous catalyst can interact with an olefin to form a metal-alkylidene bond [1, 2]. These are demonstrated below, using 2-pentene as an example to predict the first-formed products. (a) Coordination followed by a 2,1-hydrogen shift [3j. For 2-pentene, the initial coordinated carbenes would be CH3QCHZCH2CH3 and CH3CH2 CCH2CH3 M M *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed at: Department of Chemistry, UNCG, Greensboro, NC 27412, U.S.A. 0304-5102/91/$3.50 0 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 52 These initiators react with 2-pentene to give rise to branched, first-formed olefins: 4-methyl-3-heptene, 3-methyl-2-hexene, 3-ethyl-2-pentene and 4-ethyl3-hexene. (b) Fission of olefin. This process, which is unprecedented, would give rise to M=CHCH3 and M=CHCHZCH3. These would lead to normal metathesis products as the first-formed olefins. (c) Hydride transfer from the support [4]. In this process, a hydrogen is transferred to the coordinated olefin, forming a metal-alkyl bond, and the metal-carbene initiator is formed from a-hydrogen abstraction. This mechanism leads to the same initiating metal carbenes as those shown in process (a), leading to the same first-formed olefins. This process has received some experimental support from Xiaoding et al., who found that the activity for metathesis was proportional to the Bronsted acidity of the support [5]. (d) Formation of oxametallacyclobutane [6]. This process gives rise to carbonyl compounds in the generation of the initial metal carbene, followed by normal metathesis products as the first-formed olefins. O O CH3 O CZHg II II I II I -M + CH3CH=CHCH2CH3 --~ M-CH + M-CH II I I I I O O-CH O-CH I I CA CH3 I II I -> CZHSCHO + M=CHCH3 II --> CH3CH0 + M=CHC2Hs (e) Insertion of the metal into an olefinic C-H bond, followed by /3H migration. The end result of this process is identical to that described in (a), with generation of the same first-formed olefins. Evidence for this process has been obtained [7]. (f) 7r-Allyl and metallacyclobutane formation. This mechanism was deduced from studies by Green and coworkers [8-11 ] and Sherman and Schreiner [ 12 ], wherein it was found that a transition metal hydride containing a coordinated v-allylic group could be converted to a metallacyclobutane complex by migration of the coordinated hydrogen atom to the number-2 carbon of the -rr-allyl ligand (intramolecular), or a free hydride can attack the number-2 carbon of the -rr-allylic group to form a metallacyclobutane species (intermolecular). The first-formed olefins from the metathesis of 2pentene are predicted to be ethylene, propylene and 1-butene, whether isomerization to 1-pentene occurs in part, or not. Considerable evidence for the 7r-allylic process was found by Farona and Tucker [ 13 ] with Mo(CO)s/A1202 and by Grubbs and Swetnik [ 14 ] over a M003/COO/A1203 catalyst. 53 CH3CH = CHCHZCH3 ~'\\C2H5 + CH3- :'~CH M MH MH 3 III IV III ^N - ->-C2HS 'r- CH2=CH2 + M=CHC2H5 + CH2=CHC2H5 M + M=CH2 IV CH3-CH3 CH3CH=CH2 + M=CHCH3 Experimental Starting materials Alumina was obtained from Norton Co., 50-140 mesh, surface area 225300 m2 g-'. Ammonium perrhenate, NH4Re04, was purchased from Aldrich and used as received. Deuteroethylene (CHZCHD, 99 atom.% D), 13C-ethylene (*CHZ=CH2, 61 atom.% 13C), and propylene-2-dl (CH3CD=CH2, 99.3 atom.% D) were purchased from MSD Isotopes, and used as received. Ethylene (> 99.5%) and propylene (> 99%) were obtained from Aldrich and used as received. Liquid olefins were purchased from Wiley Organics in 1 ml sealed ampules. A calibration gas mixture composed of, in ppm by volume in nitrogen, ethylene (994), propylene (1015), 1-butene (1001), 1-pentene (1000) and 1-hexene (990), was obtained from Alltech Associates. The catalyst (Re207/A1203) was prepared by the aqueous impregnation of ammonium perrhenate on y-alumina and calcination in air at 550 C for 4 h, according to literature reports [ 15-19 ]. The final loading was 10.83/0 Re207 by weight, as determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. BET analysis showed that the catalyst surface area was 217 m2 g-1. Physical methods All metathesis reactions were carried out in the gas phase in a pulse catalytic microreactor [20, 21 ]. The system is comprised of a catalytic reactor which is connected directly to a gas chromatograph with both mass selective and flame ionization detection capability. Procedures Catalyst cell The catalyst (99 mg, 40-100 mesh) was contained in a quartz catalytic cell, and held in place with quartz wool plugs. The length of the catalyst bed was approximately 10 mm (L/D = 2.5). The packed cell was inserted horizontally in the reactor. Catalyst calcination Before each metathesis reaction the catalyst was regenerated by calcining in situ at 550-570 C for 2 h in a stream of dry air, followed by 1 h at 54 550-570 C in a stream of helium. Air flow through the catalyst was normally 60-80 ml min-', and helium flow was 40-60 ml min-'. The catalyst was cooled to the desired reaction temperature under helium flow. General procedure for metathesis Pulses of the reactant olefin were passed over the Re207/AI20,q catalyst, with helium (carrier gas) flow through the reactor of 70-80 ml min-'. The gas chromatographic column was cooled to - 60 C for cryogenic trapping of the metathesis products, and subsequent analysis was performed using temperature-programmed chromatographic techniques. Specific metathesis reactions and conditions For all experiments, the catalyst temperature was 150 C and the injector and transfer line temperatures were each 120 C. Ethylene and propylene pulse sizes were 0.10 ml (1 atm., 20 C), while the cis-2-pentene pulse size was 0.25 Al (1 atm, 20 C). In each case, multiple pulses were injected after calcination of the catalyst. Calibration and standardization procedures To verify reactant olefin purity and to confirm identification of the metathesis products, the catalyst was removed from the catalytic cell, and the cell was re-installed in the reactor. Pure samples of the reactants and products were injected and retention times and mass spectral patterns were recorded. To quantify reaction product weight percentages when using the MSD, 0.45 ml of the olefin calibration gas mixture was injected into the reactor, and the mass spectral pattern and area percentages were recorded. Results and discussion To show that the catalyst was active toward olefin metathesis, preliminary runs were made with cis-2-pentene, using 0.25 Al pulse injections. The catalyst showed immediate activity on the first pulse, and by the fourth pulse, the normal metathesis products (2-butene and 3-hexene) had reached a steady state of production. No branched olefins were detected, ruling out the possibility of a 2-1 H shift as the initiating process. However, propylene and 1-butene were detected very early (first two pulses), and 1-butene was not detected after the first pulse. These results tend to indicate that the -7rallylic initiating process is possible, since these two products are predicted to occur early by that mechanism. The presence of acetaldehyde or propionaldehyde, first-formed products of the oxametallacyclobutane process, was not observed, but this evidence is not considered conclusive since aldehydes may polymerize or otherwise react on the various sites of the active catalyst. Since the indication of a -rr-allylic process was present, a critical test was made, using '3CH2=CHZ in one case and CDH=CHZ in a second run. 55 Since ethylene has no allylic hydrogen, it should not metathesize if the 7rallylic process is operative as the initiator. Three pulses of 13C ethylene showed only very slight variations in the mass spectral m/e 30/29 abundance ratio, indicating that ethylene does not metathesize. To show that ethylene is capable of metathesizing in the presence of a proper initiator, the catalyst was activated with a single 0.25 g1 pulse of cis-2-pentene, followed by a fourth pulse of 13C ethylene. A 27% conversion to ethylene containing two 13C atoms was achieved on the first pulse following catalyst activation by 2-pentene. Clearly, ethylene is not capable of initiating metathesis, but metathesizes readily in the presence of an initiator. Olsthoorn and Boelhouwer [22], using an infrared cell containing a Re207/A1203 catalyst, carried out an in situ infrared spectroscopic study of metathesis initiation, and concluded that ethylene is not able to initiate metathesis, but does metathesize in the presence of, or after treatment by, a higher olefin. To verify the result obtained above, the same experiment was carried out with ethylene-dl. Again, no metathesis was detected after four pulses; activation with 2-pentene showed a dramatic increase in the production of ethylene-d2. Table 1 shows the results of this study. Table 1 shows no significant change in the m/e 30/29 abundance ratio until pulse #5, which is the one following activation of the catalyst by 2pentene. Pulses #5-8 show a slight decrease in activity, but pulses #9 and 10 show another dramatic increase in ethylene-d2, which follow a second activation pulse with 2-pentene. The results obtained for both the 13C-ethylene and monodeuteroethylene metathesis reactions clearly indicate that ethylene does not readily initiate metathesis over freshly calcined Re207/A1207, but immediately undergoes metathesis when passed over the same catalyst which was activated by cis2-pentene. The first pulse-after-activation conversions were comparable to values reported for C2H4/C2D4 cometathesis over Re207/AI203 after exposure to propylene [22].

However, if the initiation process occurs via the hydride transfer mechanism, or the 2-1 hydrogen shift mechanism, the first-formed olefins are predicted to be 1-butene, isobutylene, 2-methyl-2-butene and 2pentene. Pulses of propylene (0.10 ml) were passed over a freshly calcined catalyst and the reaction product distribution is summarized in Table 2. None of the first-formed olefins predicted by the H-transfer or 2-1 H-shift mechanisms was observed. Excess ethylene was observed, being very pronounced on the first pulse. Since the metathesis of propylene should produce equimolar amounts of ethylene and 2-butene, the higher ratios evident at the beginning of metathesis support the 7r-allyl mechanism for initial metal-carbene formation. Brenner and Burwell [23] and Hsu [24] also observed excess ethylene produced at the beginning of propylene metathesis over heterogeneous catalysts. Although 1-butene was present in the product mixture, it did not appear until the second pulse, showing it is not a first-formed olefin. The fact that 1-butene was present at a fairly constant level throughout the additional pulses tends to indicate that it arises from isomerization of 2butene. As a further test of the validity of the 7r-allyl mechanism, the metathesis of 2-deuteropropylene was also studied, using the same catalyst and conditions. In this case, if the 7r-allyl mechanism is invoked, all first-formed ethylene will be monodeuterated, and the products of metathesis will be ethylene-do and dideutero-2-butene. Other mechanisms predict the first-formed olefins to be 3-deutero-l-butene, 2-deutero-2-methylpropene, 2,3-dideutero-2-methyl2-butene and 2,5-dideutero-2-pentene as first-formed products. Table 3 shows the results of the metathesis of CH3CD=CH2.

However, a significant excess of ethylene was present in the first pulse. Also a small amount of 1-butene was present but not until the third pulse, showing that it is not a first-formed olefin. A comparison of the m/e abundance values for the molecular ions 28 and 29 (ethylene and deuteroethylene) indicates a measurable amount of deuteroethylene in the first three pulses. From previous work [22, 25] defining the number of active sites for metathesis, it is expected that 0.2 to 3.09'0 of the first pulse will contain deuteroethylene. An excess of approximately 0.39'0 was measured for the first pulse. By the fourth pulse the m/e 29/28 ratio was typical of that found for unreacted ethylene-d0 without a catalyst. It is apparent that of all the processes proposed or envisaged for generation of the initiating metal-carbene, only the 7r-allylic mechanism adequately explains the results in detail. We do not claim that the 7r-allylic process is general for all heterogeneous catalysts; however, for Re207/A1203 under the conditions studied, it certainly explains the results and appears to be the operative mechanism.

        "dc:description": "The mechanism for the initiation of olefin metathesis over the heterogeneous catalyst rhenium heptoxide on γ-alumina was studied, using a pulse catalytic microreactor. Of the currently proposed mechanisms for initial metal-carbene formation, only that which requires the reactant olefin to contain an allylic hydrogen, and proceeds by way of a π-allyl complex, predicts the first-formed olefins found in the product mixture. A critical test using isotopically labeled ethylene showed that ethylene did not self-initiate metathesis, but readily metathesized after the catalyst was activated with cis-2-pentene.",
