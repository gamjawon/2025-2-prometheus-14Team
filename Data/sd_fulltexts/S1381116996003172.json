All rights reserved 0960-1481/97 $15.00+0.00 Electricity underpins modern life. Those of us accustomed to a reliable power supply tend to forget the extent to which our social and business lives depend upon electric power - until the supply fails. However, around 2 billion people, about one third of humanity, are without access to electricity. Even a small supply of electricity for high quality light can provide a quantum leap in the quality of life. But for many isolated communities, grid electricity will remain an unfulfilled dream. For these people, a locally generated source of power is the only realistic option. In places where there is adequate solar radiation, photovoltaic (PV) systems can be the best option to provide power for homes, schools, small businesses and clinics. At home, a high quality source of light extends the day, allowing people to study, work, socialise and entertain at night. PV can provide many of the facilities enjoyed by communities connected to the grid: refrigeration for clinics, good lighting in schools for children to study after dark, and power for small power tools. PV keeps people in touch and informs through radio and television, and brings modern entertainment such as music and video cinemas. In short, it brings some of the comforts and benefits of modern life to isolated and scattered communities. Once they experience its potential, people want PV. As the cost of PV technologies comes down, these systems are becoming available to a greater number of households. Properly installed and maintained, PV systems require little attention, and there are many thousands of systems use in rural areas throughout the world. However, the reliability of PV systems depends on the availability of local expertise for their proper installation and maintenance, and a market structure that enables the easy acquisition of spare parts. In reaching the parts that are untouched by the grid, PV should be complementary to centrally generated power supplies. Unfortunately, for several reasons, PV is often seen as the inferior option. Furthermore, all too often, PV installations are substandard. Hankies suggests several reasons for this situation: 1. PV does not usually enjoy support from the utilities or government. It is generally promoted in 'an uncoordinated manner by a disparate group of organisations working in thcommunities. 163 164 P. DE GROOT 2. There are no standards applied for installation. Unfortunately, expertise is all too often non-existent in isolated areas. Too often, equipment is installed by untrained personnel who have no interest in ensuring that the system will continue to work. 3. There is no attempt to set up a self-sustaining, economically viable support structure to provide maintenance and spares. Replacement parts, although available on the world market, can be difficult or expensive to obtain. 4. There is no standardisation of components. Systems put in by different organisations, or funded by different donors, will use different fittings and consumables. This makes locating spares a nightmare. 5. There are no widely recognised standards for the performance of PV components under tropical conditions. Equipment developed and tested in the developed countries may not perform as expected under tropical conditions in the field. 6. There is no standardised training specifically for personnel working on PV systems. 7. While in the long term PV systems work out cheaper than the alternatives of kerosine and dry cell batteries, the initial outlay is beyond the means of the less well off. This paper describes work undertaken over the past five years by the Commonwealth Science Council (CSC) working in collaboration with Mark Hankins of Energy Alternatives Africa (EAA), a non-governmental organisation (NGO) based in Nairobi. This work includes developing and running practical, hands-on training courses for solar entrepreneurs based in rural area, and testing the acceptability of solar powered lanterns with a pastoral group. The Conuwealth Science Council Solar Energy Progranune The programme has so far concentrated on training solar technicians. Many PV systems fail, particularly in isolated areas, because of the chronic lack of expertise for proper installation and maintenance. There may be a number of reasons for these failures. Donors are very often only interested in providing equipment. Typically, a system is installed using outside expertise, and there are little or no resources provided for training local people. Even where it is in the budget for it, training often has a low priority. Training courses tend to take place in major urban centres, often do not specifically address the needs of rural communities, and the participants are likely to come from towns and cities. There is also a lack of trainers with sufficient first-hand knowledge of the problems affecting rural PV installations. And there is no local market infrastructure to support the trained rural based solar entrepreneurs. A cynic might even argue that there are vested interests in keeping things this way. Donors can receive kudos by merely providing high profile equipment. Foreign or city based consultants can ensure that there is always work if there is no on-site capability. A brief look at the successful spread of PV technologies in Kenya is instructive. Photovoltaic project in rural Africa 165 The development of rural based solar power in Kenya Hankins (1) has documented the growth of solar electricity in rural areas of Kenya. PV technology was first promoted in Kenya by a commercial company, Solar Shamba, that was set up by Harold Burris. The first system was installed in 1984 in a rural school with the assistance of a local electrician. The school paid for the equipment and installation costs, and the laboratory technician was trained to look after the system. The installation attracted a great deal of attention, and as a result Solar Shamba sold dozens of systems in the region. Mark Hankins, a teacher in the school, organised a solar training course for local electricians. Some trainees were taken on by a PV company in Nairobi, while others worked as agents for Solar Shamba, marketing, installing and maintaining systems in the region. The market for solar expanded rapidly, and other commercial companies became involved. In 1986 the market was given a further boost when the government abolished the 45% tax on solar modules. Today there are about 10 solar companies in Nairobi, and some 20 000 systems installed. Three factors appear to have been critical in disseminating PV technologies in rural Kenya: i) there was a solid commercial foundation from the beginning. Donor funded projects often distort the market by inflating the capital cost of the equipment, and/or reducing the price to the consumer to below the sustainable market price; ii) training was provided to rural based technicians; and iii) the market links were established between suppliers in Nairobi and technicians and entrepreneurs in the rural areas. CSC funded Hankins to write a training manual (2> and to organise a solar training workshop for people involved in PV. Two of the organisations that participated in this workshop, Karagwe Development Association (KAEA) the Olkineri Integrated Pastoralist Survival Programme (OIPSP) were involved in subsequent CSC projects. As a follow-up to this workshop, in November 1992 CSC funded Harold Burris and Mark Hankins to assist KAIZEA in developing a solar programme. KAEA is an NGO based in Kagera in northwest Tanzania devoted to community development. Its work includes revolving credit schemes to aid women's development; rainwater collection using low cost concrete tanks; afforestation; local commerce (including a cafand dispensary); carpentry; and rural electrification. The potential market for PV in the Tanzania is huge, amounting to around 30 % of the Southern African Development Conference (SADC) region as a whole. According to a study by the SADC (3), over 75 % of Tanzania's 25 million population have no mains electricity. Of the 78 % of people living in rural areas, only 1 % are connected to the grid. Unlike Kenya, the PV systems installed in Tanzania are mostly paid for by donors using specially imported equipment and expertise. These systems are generally too sophisticated for the rural dweller. Far from being stimulated, the donor-led PV activity may actually be stifling the development of the commercial market infrastructure necessary for a sustainable industry. 166 P. DE GROOT Training at the Karagwe Development Association KARADEA regards access to lighting and electrical power as a key to development at the village level. KARADEA began its work with PV in 1988 with seed funds from a support group in Sweden, and equipment purchased by SIDA. The organisation had installed 50 systems in the first five years using locally trained technicians. The Burris/Hankins report found that PV systems installed by KARADEA work well in Tanzania. However, the costs could be reduced by improving system design and using energy saving bulbs. PV technology could become an economic proposition in the area. The report also found that PV systems are viable for small businesses, and can increase income by saving costs on kerosene and batteries. The most viable systems in the area were: small domestic lighting systems; lighting and radio for shops; lighting for schools; lighting for hotels; video cinemas and discos; and battery charging stations. However, PV systems are too expensive for most people in Kagera to buy outright. Credit systems are therefore needed. The study estimates that if the money spent on kerosene and batteries was put into a credit scheme to purchase a PV system, the payback time would be 2-3 years. The report included a detailed proposal for a three year capacity building programme for KARADEA which would launch a commercial PV business initiative, develop a training centre, and start a credit programme to enable a larger proportion of the population to obtain systems. CSC was only able to support the portion of this proposal concerned with training and awareness raising. In November 1993, KARADEA opened a Solar Training Facility and ran its first training course. As part of the training, the students installed, under supervision, a PV system with 212 Wp array in the training centre, and 4 smaller systems in shops in neighbouring villages. The installation of these systems attracted a considerable amount of attention, and they continue to serve as a demonstration for PV. KARADEA has now completed 8 of these intensive training courses. Each course runs for about 17 days, with a maximum of 12 trainees. The participants are selected on the basis of their likely future involvement in PV technologies and their technical experience. Women are particularly encouraged to attend. The course itself is based on the solar manual, and covers the theory of PV, and the practical considerations necessary for designing, installing and maintaining PV systems. The hands-on training in installation and trouble shooting of installed systems is considered to be a crucial part of the course. After successfully completing both practical and theoretical modules of the course, trainees are considered to be competent to install a system under supervision. An advanced course, involving the design and installation of a complex PV system is currently being evolved. Our experience in Tanzania has shown that by holding the training in a rural area where some PV is used, we can successfully target students who intend to work in isolated areas. But the exercise is more than merely training to install and maintain systems. To begin with, it may be necessary to developing the institutional capability of organisations involved with solar to make it feasible for them to hold training courses. But there is no point in having trained personnel if there is no infrastructure to support them. A supply chain for spares and equipment must be available for repairs and for installations. If it does not exist already, support to develop this supply chain must be an integral part of any training exercise. And innovative credit schemes may be necessary to enable potential buyers raise the high initial costs of the system. Photovoltaic project in rural Africa 167 The next section describes a small project that attempts to deal with some of these considerations. Solar Lighting and Radio for Pastoralists in the 0lkonerei Region of Tanzania. The aim of this project is to catalyse the use of solar powered lantern/radio systems in the Simanjiro region of Tanzania. Specifically, the project aims to demonstrate and evaluate solar lanterns and radio systems for a pastoralist community; to look at appropriate methods for marketing the systems on a sustainable basis; and to provide feedback to manufactures concerning the acceptance and durability of their products in the field. The project, which is on-going, is being run by the OIPSP with initial technical and other assistance from EAA and financial support from the CSC and the Solar Electric Light Fund. EAA examined the technical specifications for 10 commercially available lanterns ranging in price from $50 to over $200. As OIPSP is planning to operate a community radio station for the 60 000 pastoralists in the Simanjiro region of northern Tanzania, systems that included a socket to power a radio were of particular interest. Three lanterns were selected on the basis of their overall performance, the design and quality of the unit, and the quality of light. The lanterns chosen were the Solux lantern (assembled and purchased in Kenya); the Magic Lantern, produced by Neste Advanced Power Systems (NAPS); and the BP-Tata DEEP lantern made in India. Only the Solux lantern came with a socket for a radio connection. Shipping costs to Olkonerei and duties were a significant factor in the price that the project was able to sell the lanterns. The BP-Tata lantern was subjected to 30% import duty and 15 % VAT by the Kenyan customs. Prices are given in the table below. Lantern Unit Price Shipping Duties Cost to ProjectSelling Price BP Tata $148 $31 $79 $258 $200 Solux $181 - - $181 $183 NAPS $98 $56 $5 $159 $167 (Taken from Hankins and Thagichu) OIPSP set up a sales office and publicised the lanterns. A total of 36 units were supplied to the project (5 BP-TATA, 7 Solux, 12 NAPS, and a further 12 NAPS lanterns provided for test-marketing). Lanterns could be purchased outright, by instalments (60 % of the price, with the balance payed off in 3 months, or by payment in kind (livestock or farm produce). By March 1996, the sales team had sold or agreed finance on 25 lanterns. EAA interviewed 10 users to find out why they purchased the lantern, how satisfied they were with its performance, and the improvements that they recommended. The study found that all users were satisfied with the lanterns. Although the quality of light from the BP-TATA lamp was considered the best, the Solux lamp was the most popular because of its radio. Most people purchase the lantern for lighting at night, as it extends the time for work, study and entertaining. Saving money on kerosene 168 P. DE GROOT was another important factor in purchase. People appreciated the longer duration of light obtained from the NAPS and Solux lamps (NAPS was particularly good), and the good design of the NAPS Magic Lantern. However, the most common dislike was the lack of a radio socket with the NAPS and BP-TATA lamps. In trying to establish an infrastructure for selling lanterns to pastoralists, and to help customers with credit, this project is fairly unique. According to EAA, the major problem is training personnel in sales, the establishment of credit facilities, and in repairs of lamps and installation of the module. Over the four months reported here, the project showed that there is a significant demand and people are prepared to pay quite hight prices for good quality light. Even so, it was only the richer people who could afford these lanterns, and a significant reduction in price is needed for their widespread use. Prices could be reduced by up to 25 % if shipped in bulk. An easy source of supply for the lanterns is essential, and duty on such units should be low or non existent. Although spares for these lanterns are generally available worldwide, they are not available in Arusha, the nearest city, and have to be sourced in Nairobi. Marketing lanterns without easy access to spares is probably untenable. References 1. Hankins, Mark (1993). Solar Rural Electrification in the Developing World: Four Country Case Studies.

Aromatic derivatives, chloroacetic acids A Mylonas A Hiskia E Papaconstantinou ∗ Institute of Physical Chemistry, NCSR Demokritos, 153-10 Athens, Greece ∗ Corresponding author. Polyoxometalates appear to be effective photocatalysts for a variety of organic pollutants, leading to their decomposition to CO2 and H2O and Cl− in case of chlorinated hydrocarbons. Various aromatic derivatives and chlorinated acetic acids, undergo mineralization upon photolysis with near visible and UV light, in presence of W10O4− 32, PW12O3− 40, and SiW12O4− 40. These catalysts are, at least, as effective as TiO2. The main oxidant appears to be OH radicals formed by the reaction of the excited polyoxometalates with H2O. At the initial stages of photoreaction, dioxygen has a profound effect (up to eighteen times faster) on the photodegradation of chloroacetic acid, whereas, it has minor effect on chlorophenols. On the contrary, at the final stages of photodegradation of chlorophenols, the rates were an order of magnitude faster in presence than in absence of dioxygen. Substitution of WO moiety of SiW12O4− 40 for transition metals, namely, [H2OMnIISiW11O39]6− and [H2OCuIISiW11O39]6− reduced, by about an order of magnitude, the effectiveness of the catalyst.

        "dc:description": "Polyoxometalates appear to be effective photocatalysts for a variety of organic pollutants, leading to their decomposition to CO2 and H2O and Cl− in case of chlorinated hydrocarbons. Various aromatic derivatives and chlorinated acetic acids, undergo mineralization upon photolysis with near visible and UV light, in presence of W10O4− 32, PW12O3− 40, and SiW12O4− 40. These catalysts are, at least, as effective as TiO2. The main oxidant appears to be OH radicals formed by the reaction of the excited polyoxometalates with H2O. At the initial stages of photoreaction, dioxygen has a profound effect (up to eighteen times faster) on the photodegradation of chloroacetic acid, whereas, it has minor effect on chlorophenols. On the contrary, at the final stages of photodegradation of chlorophenols, the rates were an order of magnitude faster in presence than in absence of dioxygen. Substitution of WO moiety of SiW12O4− 40 for transition metals, namely, [H2OMnIISiW11O39]6− and [H2OCuIISiW11O39]6− reduced, by about an order of magnitude, the effectiveness of the catalyst.",
