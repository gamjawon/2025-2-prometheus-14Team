At 300 the conversion is near 100% over all samples, but the selectivity to p-cymene depends on catalyst preparation. Ion exchange in slurries with adjusted pH resulted in catalysts with much more uniform metal loading than contacting the extruded zeolite with an aqueous solution of the metal ions. Ce promoted Pd/ZSM5 samples gave higher selectivities to p-cymene than unpromoted Pd/ZSM5. XPS data suggest an interaction between Pd- and CeOz-particles, but hydrolysis of Ce ions to Ce hydroxide gel can lead to formation of acid sites which catalyze formation of undesired byproducts. Hydrolysis can be minimized by ion exchange at low pH. 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

In early publications, sup- ported Pd and Pt catalysts were proposed for the conversion of c~-limonene and c~-pinene to p-cymene [5-8]. However, as the conversion of purified terpenes is commercially less attractive, a new catalyst was developed in a previous study [9]. It was found active in the conversion of a mixed feedstock containing 32 t~A. Weyrich et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 163 (1997) 31-44 monocyclic, bicyclic and substituted terpenes carrying oxygen groups [10,11]. Mixed terpene feedstocks are widely available as byproducts in the production of orange juice or cellulose derived materials. Such renewable organic materials are believed to have a great potential for industrial organic synthesis [12]. The new catalyst was developed empirically; it is basically a cerium promoted palladium catalyst sup- ported on zeolite NaZSM5. It was found to be more resistant towards deactivation and to exhibit a higher dehydrogenation activity than a similar catalyst with- out the cerium promoter. A mechanism was proposed involving both acid and metal sites. Acid sites are generated during H2 reduction of the Pd ions in the zeolite pores. They are assumed to catalyze double bond and skeletal isomerizations, dehydration and C-C fission, including ring-opening; whereas the Pd sites in this catalyst are assumed to catalyze the dehydrogenation step [13]. One objective of the present study is to clarify the role of the Ce promoter on the catalytic performance in the light of the proposed reaction pathway. For this purpose, two sets of Pd, Ce, and (Pd+Ce) loaded NaZSM5 catalysts were prepared at RWTH Aachen and Northwestern University. They were examined by TPR, XPS, TEM; catalytic tests were carried out, using the conversion of c~-limonene as a probe. A second objective was to compare the effect of ion exchange conditions on catalyst uniformity and per- formance. Comparison was made between samples prepared in two ways: (a) ion exchange of the extruded zeolite, and (b) ion exchange of a slurry of fine zeolite powder in an aqueous solution, with adjusted pH, of the metal salt. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation Two series of ZSM5 supported catalysts were used. Those made in Aachen have the suffix (AC) after the chemical description; catalysts made at Northwestern University are labeled (NU). The catalysts of the AC series were prepared by the ion exchange into NaZSM5 (A1Si-Penta-SN55, kindly provided by VAW Aluminum AG). The crystallinity of the zeolite was checked by X-ray diffraction. Elemental analysis via inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spec- troscopy (ICP) gave a Si/Al atomic ratio of 23 and a Na/A1 atomic ratio of 2.1, indicating excess Na20 in the zeolite pores. Prior to ion exchange, the zeolite was extruded to cords of 2 mm diameter, dried in air at 110 overnight and calcined in air at 550 during 6 h to remove the peptizing agent methylcellulose. The catalyst was then crushed and sieved to particles of 1.0-1.6 mm diameter. The zeolite extrudates of this series were used without prior washing or neutraliza- tion. First, Ce was inserted in the zeolite by circulating 800 ml of a 0.1 M Ce(NO3)3-solution over 80 g of the zeolite particles at 80 for 24 h. The zeolite was subsequently filtered, washed with 21 doubly de- ionized (DDI) water, dried in air at 110 overnight and calcined in air at 550 for 6 h. The exchange of Ce ions was performed three times. The exchange of Pd ions was carried out in the same way on the parent zeolite and the Ce-exchanged zeolite by circulating 800 ml of a Pd[NH3]4(NO3)z-solution over 20 g of the zeolite for 24 h at 80. The amount of Pd needed for a 1 wt% insertion was calculated and the respective amount of tetraamminepalladium(II) nitrate solution used. The catalyst was subsequently filtered, washed with 2 1 DDI-water, dried in air at RT and stored until use. With the catalysts of the NU series, NaZSM5 was obtained from UOP, Lot # 13023-60, with a Si/AI ratio of 18. Since excess Na20 in the zeolite led to a pH 9.5 of the slurry, the pH was adjusted to pH=6 by drop- wise addition of HNO3 prior to ion exchange. Ion exchange was carried out in a slurry (2000 ml HaO/g zeolite), using 5 g of the zeolite powder, obtained by crushing the extrudates. Exchange of Ce was repeated three times by dropwise addition of 1000 ml of a 0.01 M Ce(NO3)3 solution (pH 5.4) over a period of 24 h, followed by slurrying for another 24 h. In between, the samples were washed, filtered, dried and calcined as reported above for the AC samples. Exchange of Pd was carried out by dropwise addition of 1000 ml of a Pd[NH3]4(NO3)a solution with the calculated amount of Pd to either the parent or the Ce exchanged zeolite. All Pd containing samples were calcined prior to their use in a flow of UHP oxygen (200 ml/min g) by ramping the calcination temperature with a slope of 0.5 K/min from RT to 500 and holding at this temperature for 2 h. The compositions of the catalysts as derived from ICP are compiled in Table 1. P.A.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) XPS spectra of calcined Pd/NaZSM5 and (Pd+Ce)/ NaZSM5 samples were recorded on a VG-ESCA- LAB-5 spectrometer using MgKc~12 radiation. The samples were pressed into pellets and mounted on sample holders using colloidal silver. Binding ener- gies were referenced to the C ls line at 284.6 eV [14] to correct for charging of the sample. Intensities were obtained by peak integration assuming a linear base- line. Elemental ratios were obtained by the following empirically derived sensitivity factors: Si 2s: 0.26, Ce 3d: 10, Pd 3d: 4.6 [15]. Spectra of (Pd+Ce)/NaZSM5 samples were also recorded after reduction. Reduction was carried out in situ in a pretreatment cell in the spectrometer in flowing hydrogen (24 ml/min, 300 for 2 h). The reduced samples were transferred into the sampling position without exposure to air. 2.3. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) All samples were reduced in 5% H2/Ar by TPR in an open flow system as described elsewhere [16]. The Pd containing samples were cooled down to -78 in Ar before the gas flow was switched to H2+Ar (30 ml/ min). The temperature was then ramped with 8 K/min from -40 to 500. TPR-spectra of Ce-only con- taining samples were taken by ramping the tempera- ture from RT to 750 at 8 K/min. 2.4. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) Samples Pd/NaZSM5 (AC) and (Pd+Ce)/NaZSM5 (AC) were examined by TEM. The powders were dispersed onto holey carbon grids and placed into the microscope column which was evacuated to around 1.3 x 10 6 Pa. A Hitachi HF-2000 High Reso- lution Analytical Electron Microscope (HRAEM) with a field emission gun was operated at 200 kV. Bright field imaging in a range of 150000-300000 times could be obtained. 2.5. c~-limonene conversion All catalysts were reduced in situ in flowing H2 (24 ml/min) by ramping the temperature from RT to 300 at 8 K/min and holding it for 1 h at 300. Upon reaching the desired reaction temperature the feed was admitted. Unless stated otherwise, c~-limo- nene conversion was studied at 300 and atmos- pheric pressure. In samples denoted amm. the acid sites were neutralized in a flow of ammonia for 20 min at room temperature after reduction. During transfer of the catalysts to the reactor they were exposed to air. Therefore, the catalysts were heated in flowing H2 from RT to reaction temperature at a rate of 8 K/min and held at that temperature for 20 min before the reaction was started. A mixture of c~-limonene and n-pentane (20 vol% c~-limonene, 80 vol% n-pentane) was brought into the reactor inlet by means of a volumetric pump at a rate of 5.76 ml/h. The feed evaporated at the reactor inlet and the vapor was transported via a flow of 24 ml/min H2 over the catalyst. The resulting c~-limonene partial pressure in the feed is 7 kPa, WHSV is 48.4 h 1. Dilution of the c~-limonene feed was necessary for product separation in the GC-column. n-Pentane was used as the diluent, its inertness was verified by blank runs. On-line analysis of the products was made with a Hewlett Packard G1800A GCD system, equipped with a 30 m Pona column and an electron ionization detector. 3. Results D. fJ C e- The metal loadings of the exchanged zeolites as determined by ICP analysis are shown in Table 1. In the absence of hydrolysis, each Ce3+ ion would replace three Na+-ions; complete exchange of all Na+ ions of the NaZSM5 zeolite with a molar SIO2/A1203 ratio of 46 would be represented by a Ce content of 3.0 wt%. All observed Ce loadings are below this value. As will be discussed below, this is ascribed to extensive hydrolysis leading to precipita- tion of a hydroxide gel on or near the surface of the zeolite granule. The higher metal loading for the extruded AC samples in comparison to the NU series might be caused by the higher exchange temperature used in the AC series. For the unpromoted Pd/NaZSM5 samples, the values of the Na/A1 ratio are close to unity for both samples, indicating that the zeolite retained part of its excess Na. However, exchange of the Ce loaded samples with Pd[NH3]4(NO3)2 leads to a drastic decrease of the Na/A1 ratio to 0.28 and 0.47, respec- tively. Apparently, excess Na was removed during the Ce exchange procedure and subsequent Pd2+ exchange shows the characteristics of true ion exchange. XPS analysis was performed in order to get an impression on the metal content near the external surface. Integration of the Si 2s, Ce 3d, and Pd 3d XPS peaks was carried out; the results are compiled in Table 2, together with the bulk concentrations deter- mined by ICE Clearly, the (AC) samples show a significant surface enrichment of Ce; the Ce/Si ratio obtained by XPS is more than 10 times higher than that obtained by ICE Surface enrichment is less pronounced but still present in the NU sample, with a Ce/Si ratio obtained by XPS being ~3.4 times higher than that by ICE The values obtained of the Pd/Si ratios appear to depend on the pH during preparation and the presence or absence of the Ce promoter. For the unpromoted Pd/NaZSM5 (AC) sample, the surface Pd/Si ratio obtained by XPS is below the bulk ratio obtained by ICE but for the promoted (Pd+Ce)/ NaZSM5 (AC) sample the situation is reversed. For the pH adjusted NU samples the Pd/Si ratios obtained by XPS and ICP are equal within experimental error.

Weyrich et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 163 (1997) 31-44 35 Spectra were recorded after calcination (spectrum a), reduction in flowing hydrogen (20 ml/min) at 300/ 4 h and brief exposure to ambient air, due to a leakage in the pretreatment chamber (spectrum b) and in situ reduction, as above, without exposure to air (spectrum c). After calcination at 500, a Pd 3d5/2 BE of 336.6 eV is observed, which is close to the binding energy (BE) of PdO (337.0 eV) [13]. In situ reduction of catalysts produces Pdwith a BE of 335.0 eV, which is in good agreement with the BE of Pd foils 334.9 eV [17]. As expected for small metal particles, even brief exposure to ambient air drastically changes the binding energy of Pd 3d5/2 to a value BE =335.5 eV. A very similar value of the Pd 3d5/2 peak at 335.8 eV has been observed by Shyu et al. [13] with a Pd/CeO2/A1203-catalyst exposed to air. The authors attribute this peak to an oxidation state between PdO and Pd They also report that Pd supported on A1203 is much less oxidized upon expo- sure to air. Thus, the effect of the ceria can be assumed to reflect either a higher metal dispersion of Pd anchored on ceria, or a chemical promotion of the Pd oxidation. XPS spectra of cerium compounds are known to be rather complex. The spectrum of CeO2 can be resolved into eight components. The theoretical basis for all the components is described in detail in the literature [ 18- 20]. Important for the present study is the presence of the so called u'\" peak, which arises from a transition to the 4ffinal state from the 4finitial state. This peak is characteristic for Ce4+ and has been used as a quan- titative measure of the amount of Ce4+ [21]. The XPS spectra of the Ce 3d core level of sample (Pd+Ce)/ NaZSM5 (AC) are shown in Fig. 2, the percentages of u'\" are listed in Table 3. The corresponding percen- tage of Ce4+ is calculated from the percentage of u'\" using the conversion curve reported by Shyu et al. [15].

Ce 3d XPS spectra of (Pd+Ce)/NaZSM5 (AC) catalysts after calcination at 500 (a), reduction and exposure to ambient air (b) and in situ reduction at 300. The XPS data suggest that not all Ce is present as Ce4+ after calcination at 500. However, Ce4+ is partly reduced by hydrogen in the presence of Pd at temperatures as low as 300. The differences between the AC and the NU samples are not very prominent, except for the value of u\" after in situ reduction. The lower value of the NU sample indicates an enhanced promotion of Ce4+ reduction by the Pd. TPR profiles of the samples Pd/NaZSM5 (AC) (a) and (Pd+Ce)/NaZSM5 (AC) (b) are shown in Fig. 3. Peak assignment makes use of literature reports on TPR of Pd/SiO2 and Pd/NaY, as few reports could be found on Pd/ZSM5. Both samples show a main reduc- tion peak at around 0, which indicates reduction of Table 3 Percentage Ce4+ in Pd/Ce-NaZSM5 catalysts as calculated from the u'\" peak Sample Treatment u\" (%) Ce4+ (%) (Pd+Ce)/NaZSM5 (AC) Calcined 500 8.99 62 Reduced, exposed to air 6.82 47 Reduced in situ 300 6.13 43 (Pd+Ce)/NaZSM5 (NU) Calcined 500 8.15 56 Reduced in situ 300 4.27 29 3500 3000 3000 .~ 2500 E\" 2000 ._~ 1500 u) c looo ' J I I I -100 100 300 500 Temperature [] Fig. 3.

The negative peak centered at around 57 is ascribed to the decomposition of 13-Pd hydride, as reported by Fagherazzi et al. [23] for Pd/SiO2. The difference in peak position between their value (67- 76) and the value observed here is presumably caused by the different TPR setup. The negative fl-Pd hydride decomposition peak is absent in the (Pd+Ce)/NaZSM5 (AC) spectra. A dependence of hydrogen solubility in Pd on Pd dispersion has been reported by Boudart and Hwang [24]; they found that the solubility decreases linearly with Pd dispersion, and vanishes at 100% dispersion. The absence of the decomposition peak thus indicates smaller Pd parti- cles as a result of a chemical interaction between Pd and the CeO2-particles. Sintering effects can be dis- regarded, as the Pd containing samples were never heated above 500 before TPR experiments. The spectrum of (Pd+Ce)/NaZSM5 (AC) also reveals a broad peak centered at around 127, which might be ascribed to the reduction of the ceria surface. It is well known from studies on Pt/CeOffAl203 automotive catalysts that CeO2 is readily reduced in the presence of Pt around 120-150 [25]. Recently, reduction of capping oxide ions of ceria has been reported even at subambient temperature [26]. Quantitative analysis of the degree of ceria reduction is impossible with the present TPR method, because of interfering Ar de- sorption. The TPR profiles of Pd/NaZSM5 (NU) (a) and (Pd+Ce)/NaZSM5 (NU) (b) are shown in Fig. 4. All spectra are dominated by the PdO reduction peak around 0 and show the/3-Pd hydride decomposition peak. Surprisingly, the spectrum of sample (Pd+Ce)/ NaZSM5 (NU) is almost identical with that of sample Pd/NaZSM5 (NU); the broad peak around 127 observed for (Pd+Ce)/NaZSM5 (AC) is absent on both spectra. This could suggest that Cea+ reduction might indeed take place at a lower temperatures, as proposed by Golunski et al. [22]. Several authors report [21,22,27] that the capping oxide ions of ceria are reductively removed near 500, depending on the CeO2 surface area, whereas bulk ceria is reduced only above 700. The hydrogen consumption for removal of the capping oxide ions can be used to calculate CeO2 particle sizes [28]. As the present XPS and ICP results indicate that most of the cerium is located at the external zeolite surface in the form of CeO2 particles, an attempt was made to estimate the particle sizes from the capping Hc/Ce ratio derived from the TPR profiles of Ce/NaZSM5 (AC) (Fig. 5 (a)) and P.A.

TPR spectra of samples Ce/NaZSM5 (AC) (a), Ce/NaZSM5 (NU) (b). Ce/NaZSM5 (NU) (Fig. 5 (b)). Both spectra show two reduction peaks well below 700, with the peak positions shifted to lower temperatures for the sample prepared at Northwestern. The broad reduction peak centered at 700, partly underlying the low-tempera- ture CeO2 reduction peaks is also present in the TPR spectra of the parent NaZSM5 and not addressed to further. However, the presence of two low-temperature CeO2 reduction peaks may be a consequence of the peculiar preparation method of the samples, for which Ce was exchanged three times. A similar observation has been made by Johnson and Mooi [24], who related the occurrence of two reduction peaks to separate calcination of CeO2. The capping Hc/Ce ratio and the CeO2 particle sizes calculated are presented in Table 4. The crystallite sizes of the CeO2-particles on the zeolite surface are calculated assuming cubic CeO2-particles.

The sample was reduced in flowing hydrogen at 300 for 2 h before taking the micrographs. The Pd-particle sizes seen in (a) are as large as 150 ,~, whereas in (b) only particles below 20 A are present. This clearly shows an inhomogeneous Pd-distribution throughout the catalyst, which was ion-exchanged by pumping an aqueous Pd[NH3]a(NO3)2-solution for 24 h over the extrudate. It has been reported that metal uptake and metal dispersion in zeolite Y is dependant upon Pd- concentration in the zeolite slurry and the time the ions are allowed to exchange [29,30]. A plausible explana- tion for the variance in particle size is that after short exchange times a concentration gradient exists across the catalyst pellet. The periphery of the pellet and of the individual zeolite grains will be richer in Pd2+ ions than the interior of these particles. This will lead to Pd particle growth during calcination and reduction. Micrographs of samples Ce/NaZSM5 (AC) and (Pd+Ce)/NaZSM5 (AC) are shown in Fig. 6(c) and (d). CeO2 is present in <60 ,~ particles at the surface; the visible particles appear to have a more homoge- neous size distribution. Adding Pd to the Ce/NaZSM5 (AC) catalyst alters the distribution of the metal particles significantly. Now, Pd-particles <50 A are present in high density in certain areas, no isolated CeO2 particles are visible, suggesting a mutual attrac- tion of the Pd- and CeOz-particles. Coveting or partial covering of the Pd particles by CeO2 or the reduced Ce203 is not observed, but cannot be excluded either. The AC catalysts have been extensively tested [9,10]; the (Pd+Ce)/NaZSM5 (AC) proved to be more resistant against deactivation and it exhibited a super- ior selectivity towards dehydrogenated products in the conversion of various terpenes towards p-cymene as its Pd/NaZSM5 (AC) counterpart, motivating the pre- sent study. The terpenes did not undergo transalkyla- tion on medium-pore ZSM5 type zeolites, as observed on large pore zeolites Y and/3. An intrazeolitic path- way was suggested, involving ring-opening of bicyclic terpenes, dehydration of cineols and skeletal isomer- ization of monocyclic terpenes prior to dehydrogena- tion. Initial product distributions after 10 min time on stream (TOS) over zeolite catalysts are shown in Table 5.

Conversion of c~-limonene over Pd/NaZSM5 cata- lysts leads to higher yields of the hydrogenated pro- ducts p-menthane and p-menthene than over the Ce promoted counterparts, as evidenced by lower values of the parameter ,b. Also, this ratio is higher for the NU samples than for the AC catalysts, not only initially but over the entire observed period of 6 h TOS. For all zeolite catalysts, the initial selectivity towards p-menthene increases with TOS, while the selectivity toward p-menthane decreases. This indicates a change of either the chemistry or the accessibility of the active Pd sites. Zhang et al. [31] reported agglomeration of Pd-particles in ZSM5 catalysts upon their contact with molecules containing tertiary C atoms. Lower Pd dispersion is expected to lead to lower rate of hydro- genation. Product distributions with AC catalysts over four weeks TOS are given elsewhere [9,10]. In some experiments the acid sites were neutralized by exposure to ammonia, in order to reduce the formation of undesired byproducts. Neutralization of zeolite protons does, however, also deprive the Pd particles of their chemical anchors, they will there- fore grow during catalysis at elevated temperatures [31]. The catalytic results at TOS=10 min of c~-limo- nene conversion over ammonia treated catalysts are shown in Table 6. The results show that the formation of cracked products is indeed greatly reduced by the ammonia treatment of the catalysts, while the distribution among the Cto products is not aversely affected. The Pd/NaZSM5 (NU) sample which, before exposure to ammonia, gave much less cracking than the other samples, is not improved by the ammonia treatment, indicating deactivation of the metal sites.

Effect of catalyst preparation procedure The results of this study show that the conditions of catalyst preparation strongly affect the state and the distribution of metal and promoter over the support. In particular, the state of the sample during ion exchange is crucial. If samples are extruded prior to this treat- ment, a less uniform distribution of the metal over the support is obtained than if ion exchange is carried out while the zeolite powder is suspended in the aqueous solution of the metal salt while temperature, pH and duration of the ion exchange process are carefully adjusted. Palladium distribution in the samples prepared by ion exchange after extrusion is very inhomogeneous. TEM photographs clearly show very large particles around 150 A at the external surface of the catalyst, but much smaller Pd particles are formed in the interior. The inhomogeneity in these samples is also reflected by the XPS data; the Pd/Si ratio is below that of the bulk. However, XPS only scans the surface about 50-100 ,~ deep. Thus, in the presence of very large Pd-particles, XPS detects only the outermost atomic layer. This phenomenon is known to lead to an apparent deficit of the metal in the material balance. The situation is different for the samples prepared by ion exchange of the slurry with properly adjusted pH. In these samples the Pd/Si ratio appears to be equal for the surface and the interior, both for pro- moted and unpromoted catalysts. In the Ce promoted samples that were prepared after extrusion, the Pd/Si ratio is higher, possibly because a significant part of the Pd will be anchored on ceria particles near the external surface. Accordingly, the TEM micrographs of sample (Pd+Ce)/NaZSM5 (AC) show agglomeration of Pd particles in some areas. Distinct CeO2 particles, as observed for Ce/NaZSM5 (AC), are not visible in (Pd+Ce)/NaZSM5 (AC). No ceria induced enrichment of Pd near the surface has been observed for the slurried sample (Pd+Ce)/ NaZSM5 (NU). This may simply be due to the absence of a strong Ce surface enrichment of the slurried sample. The Pd uptake of the slurried sample is not com- plete, indicating a slower ion-exchange process at the lower exchange temperature applied to this sample. The agreement between surface and bulk Pd/Si ratios indicates no surface enrichment; most of the Pd is located inside the zeolite pores. The TPR profiles of (Pd+Ce)/NaZSM5 samples show substantial differences between slurried and extruded samples. The TPR profile of the slurried sample resembles very much that of the unpromoted Pd/NaZSM5 samples, with some CeO2 coreduced with PdO at fairly low temperature, as follows from the XPS results. In contrast, the pre-extruded samples display a second TPR peak, attributable to reduction of CeO2. From the position of this peak, shifted to a lower temperature than in Pd-free samples, it is assumed that CeO2 and Pd particles interact, analo- gous to the known interaction in Pt/CeO2. Reduced Pd in close proximity to CeO2 particles, dissociates adsorbed hydrogen at lower temperature, thereby enhancing the reducibility of CeO2. The absence of that TPR peak in the slurried sample (Pd+Ce)/ NaZSM5 (NU) indicates the absence of reducible CeO2 particles at the external surface. 4.2. Interaction of ceria with palladium Although Ce3+ ions are used for the exchange, these ions tend to hydrolyze inside the zeolite at high pH. The Na/A1 ratio of 2.1 in the untreated zeolite clearly shows the presence of excess Na20. In the presence of water, NaOH is formed, the Ce3+ ions hydrolyze and a Ce(OH)3 gel is precipitated on or near the external surface of the zeolite [ 14]. During subsequent calcina- tion the cerium hydroxide gel is dehydrated to ceria: Na20 H20 :=~ 2NaOH Ce3+ + 3OH- ~ Ce(OH)3 4Ce(OH)3 + O2 =~ 4CEO2 + 6H20 Gel precipitation takes place at the external surface of the zeolite. This is confirmed by XPS data, which show a ten times higher Ce/Si ratio at the surface than at the interior for the extruded samples. Lowering the pH during ion-exchange reduces gel formation and leads to much lower surface enrichment of Ce. 42 P.A. Weyrich et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 163 (1997) 31~14 Hydrolysis can be limited to some extent by wash- ing the zeolite prior to ion exchange. For samples in which the pH has been adjusted to pH 6, the hydrolysis equilibrium is limited to Ce3+ + 3H20~-Ce(OH)3 + 3H+ This type of hydrolysis, which is known to produce Brc~nsted acid sites, is favored by a large distance between charge compensating sites in the ZSM5 lattice with a relatively high SIO2/A1203 ratio. Repla- cing a tripositive ion with three monopositive ions provides a means to lower the Coulomb energy of the system by bringing positive charges closer to negative charges. The high Na/A1 ratios after Ce-exchange indicate that only a fraction of the Ce is truly ion-exchanged against Na+ ions in the zeolite. As expected, hydro- lysis and gel precipitation are smaller and, conse- quently, the Ce content is lower for the pH adjusted samples prepared in a slurry than for the extruded samples. However, even in the extruded samples some Ce is ion-exchanged, as evidenced by the value of the Na/A1 ratio <1. For a rationalization of the catalytic promotion by Ce, a chemical interaction between Pd and Ce has been proposed, in analogy to the strong-metal-sup- port-interaction as known for the Pt/TiO2 system. In this system an overlayer of TiO2 has been shown to cover the Pt particles, at least partly [32-34]. Also, results by Trevifio et al. with zeolite supported Mn promoted Rh catalysts show that a strong interaction can exist between Rh clusters and MnO clusters inside zeolite cavities [35]. This interaction has been assumed to be crucial for the pronounced promoting effect of Mn towards formation of oxygenates in the Rh catalyzed conversion of syngas. However, Datye [36] could not detect a CeO2 overlayer on top of the Pt particles. Instead, he found that the Pt particles are often epitactic with the CeO2 support. Micrographs of samples Ce/NaZSM5 (AC) and (Pd+Ce)/NaZSM5 (AC) are shown in Fig. 6(c) and (d). CeO2 is present in particles <60 ,~ in high density on the surface; no strong inhomogeneity is observed in the particle size distribution. However, addition of Pd to the Ce/ NaZSM5 (AC) alters the distribution of the metals significantly. Pd-particles <50 A, are present in high density in certain areas, whereas isolated CeO2 particles are no longer seen. This suggests a mutual attraction of the Pd- and CeOz-particles. Covering or partial covering of the Pd particles by CeO2 or the reduced Ce203 is not observed, but cannot be excluded either. An interaction between Pd and CeO2 inside the zeolite is suggested by the very small size of the Pd particles in the promoted catalysts in comparison to the unpromoted samples. The small Pd particles are swiftly oxidized upon exposure to air, as is confirmed by the immediate change in binding energy, identified by XPS. The XPS data of the Ce 3d core level show that Pd enhances the reduction of CeO2 to Ce203 at tempera- tures as low as 300. This, again, indicates a strong Pd/CeO2 interaction. However, reduction of CeO2 tO Ce203 at 300 is not complete after 4 h. Two low- temperature reduction peaks are shown by the TPR of Ce-NaZSM5 catalysts. Both are ascribed to partial reduction of ceria particles; no reduction of isolated Ce3+ is detected. The reduction peaks are indicative for the removal of capping oxide ions of CeO2. The presence of two peaks has been reported for separately calcined material [24]. One can imagine that more than one type of ceria particles is created upon ion exchanging and calcining the same sample three times. The shift of the reduction peak to considerably lower temperatures for the slurried sample is thought to be due to a smaller particle sizes. It has been reported before that the reduction temperature of ceria is shifted to lower value, while the specific surface increases [21,24]. The TPR profiles of both Pd/NaZSM5 samples show that the predominant Pd-species is PdO, not Pd2+ ions. Reduction of PdO to metallic Pdis evident from the negative TPR peak caused by the decom- position of/3-Pd hydride. No TPR peak characteristic for Pd ions was observed in any sample in the present study, indicating a high extent of hydrolysis of the exchanged Pd-ions inside the zeolite. As mentioned, the pre-extruded promoted sample, (Pd+Ce)/NaZSM5 (AC), (Fig. 3, trace b) does not display the /3-Pd hydride decomposition signal. As this sample contains large CeO2 particles and small Pd clusters, it is conceivable that the clusters are too small to accommodate the Pd-hydride. Again, the absence of a second reduction peak in Fig. 4, trace b, for the slurried sample (Pd+Ce)/NaZSM5 (NU) PA. Weyrich et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 163 (1997) 31-44 43 indicates that in this sample no large Ce02 particles, decorated with Pd clusters, exist at the surface of this catalyst. 4.3. Catalyst selectivity and reaction mechanism Previously, a bifunctional mechanism had been proposed for the conversion of c~-limonene [10]. It was assumed that an acid catalyzed shift of the double bond from the isopropenyl-group into the cyclohex- ene-ring is followed by dehydrogenation on a palla- dium site. The present data confirm the existence of acid and metal sites and their interplay. It is interesting to compare the p-cymene/p-menthane ratio with the theoretical equilibrium value. As thermodynamic data for p-menthane are not readily available, we based our estimate on the homologue system toluene/methylcy- clohexane. From the data in Table 5, at 300, the p- cymene/p-menthane ratios, especially in the NU cat- alysts (23.2 for the unpromoted sample, 25.4 for the promoted one), are very close to the ratio of 27.9 calculated for the toluene/methylcyclohexane ratio in equilibrium. In contrast, the observed p-cymene/p- menthane ratio of ~1.2 found in catalytic tests at 200 differs significantly from the calculated ratio of 0.06 for the toluene/methylcyclohexane equili- brium. This indicates that the product composition is kinetically controlled at 200 but near equilibrium at 300. The fraction of products with saturated C6 rings is distinctly lower for the Ce promoted than for the unpromoted Pd/NaZSM5 catalysts. Two kinds of catalytic selectivity are of interest. First, it is desirable to have a high content of products with ten C atoms, i.e. a low selectivity towards crack- ing over acid sites and hydrogenolysis over metal sites. Second, a high extent of aromatic compounds within the fraction of products with ten C atoms is desirable. The former type of selectivity is illustrated by the product distributions in Table 5 and 6. Clearly, neutralization of acid sites with ammonia leads to a lower production of cracking products, in particular formation of toluene+propane is suppressed. In the absence of ammonia, Br~nsted acid sites are generated during reduction of the ion-exchanged Pd2+ ions. These acid sites become poisoned during the reaction by the formation of cracked byproducts. BrCnsted acid sites are also generated by hydrolysis of Ce3+ ions; as a consequence far more cracking products are formed over (Pd+Ce)/NaZSM5 catalysts than over unpro- moted Pd/NaZSM5. This conclusion is valid both for the AC and the NU catalysts. The (Pd+Ce)/ NaZSM5 catalysts have lower Na/A1 ratios than the Pd/NaZSM5 catalysts. Remember that the zeolites initially contain an excess of Na20; part of this is removed by the twofold ion exchange. Therefore. protons created during hydrolysis cannot be neutra- lized by excess Na20. The slightly lower formation of cracked byproducts over the slurried Pd/NaZSM5 samples in comparison to the pre-extruded samples can be explained by the generation of less protons, due to the lower metal content of these catalysts. Neutralization of acid sites by ammonia also affects the second type of selectivity, indicated by the 05 ratios, as illustrated by the data in Table 7. They show that suppression of acid catalyzed reactions leads to a large fraction of Cm products, but within this fraction the concentration of molecules with aromatic rings depends on the activity of the metal component of the catalyst. In the three ammonia treated samples Pd/ NaZSM5 (AC), Pd/NaZSM5 (NU) and (Pd+Ce)/ NaZSM5 (NU) hydrogenation leads to considerable saturation of the aromatic rings. As shown in Table 5 and Table 6, the ~ p-menthene fraction increases more than sixfold, when the (Pd+Ce)/NaZSM5 (NU) is treated with ammonia. As a result, the 05 ratio is decreased for this catalyst. The other samples show a less dramatic increase in the hydrogenation activity and, therefore, display a higher 05 value after neutra- lization of the acid sites. A 05 value as high as 20.6 is observed with the (Pd+Ce)/NaZSM5 (AC) catalyst. This shows that catalytic selectivities of this type are controlled by the interplay of parallel and sequential reactions on metal and acid sites; their optimalization requires a very subtle fine-tuning of these catalyst functions.

Weyrich et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 163 (1997) 31-44 5. Conclusions A chemical interaction exists between CeO2 and Pd particles inside ZSM5 cavities. The physical charac- teristics and the catalytic performance of zeolite sup- ported palladium catalysts depend strongly on the method of preparation. Hydrolysis of Ce3+ ions to Ce hydroxide gel is followed by formation of ceria during catalyst calcination. This ceria is preferentially located at the external surface of zeolite particles. This surface enrichment of ceria can be largely prevented by adjusting the pH during ion exchange. Much more homogeneous catalysts are obtained by ion exchange of a slurry than by contact of solid and solution after extrusion. Acid sites are created by two processes: (1) H2 reduction of Pd2+ ions and (2) hydrolysis of Ce3+ ions. In the conversion of c~-limonene, the formation of products with less than ten carbon atoms is mainly acid catalyzed. Acid sites can be neutralized by addi- tion of ammonia; they are also poisoned by side products of the cracking process. A careful fine-tuning of the acid and the metal sites in this catalyst can lead to a high selectivity for Clo products with an aromatic ring. Acknowledgements The authors thank Dr. Timothy J.

Tel.: +1 847 4915263; fax: +1 847 4671018 Ce-promoted and unpromoted Pd/ZSM5 catalysts were prepared, characterized by TPR, XPS and TEM, and tested for the dehydroisomerization of α-limonene to p-cymene. At 300°C the conversion is near 100% over all samples, but the selectivity to p-cymene depends on catalyst preparation. Ion exchange in slurries with adjusted pH resulted in catalysts with much more uniform metal loading than contacting the extruded zeolite with an aqueous solution of the metal ions. Ce promoted Pd/ZSM5 samples gave higher selectivities to p-cymene than unpromoted Pd/ZSM5. XPS data suggest an interaction between Pd- and CeO2-particles, but hydrolysis of Ce ions to Ce hydroxide gel can lead to formation of acid sites which catalyze formation of undesired byproducts.

        "dc:description": "Ce-promoted and unpromoted Pd/ZSM5 catalysts were prepared, characterized by TPR, XPS and TEM, and tested for the dehydroisomerization of α-limonene to p-cymene. At 300°C the conversion is near 100% over all samples, but the selectivity to p-cymene depends on catalyst preparation. Ion exchange in slurries with adjusted pH resulted in catalysts with much more uniform metal loading than contacting the extruded zeolite with an aqueous solution of the metal ions. Ce promoted Pd/ZSM5 samples gave higher selectivities to p-cymene than unpromoted Pd/ZSM5. XPS data suggest an interaction between Pd- and CeO2-particles, but hydrolysis of Ce ions to Ce hydroxide gel can lead to formation of acid sites which catalyze formation of undesired byproducts. Hydrolysis can be minimized by ion exchange at low pH.",
