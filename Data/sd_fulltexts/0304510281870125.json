SOME ANSWERS FROM IR INVESTIGATIONS B- REBENSTORF* and R- LARSSON Division of fnorgareic Chemistry 1, Chemical Center, University of Lard, Box 740, S-220 07 Lund 7 (Sweden) Summary Both title catalysts show strong i.r. bands after adsorption of CO, which are assigned to bridging CO molecules. These CO i.r. bands are at 2120, 2100 and 2035 cm-1 at low temperatures (-145 C) for the CO -reduced Phillips catalyst (Zecchina et a1., 1975) or at 1920, 1825 and 1620 cm: 1- (Union Carbide catalyst). Single-bonded CO is observed showing i_r. bands at 2190, 2186 and 2179 cm: I - shifted to higher wavenumbers than CO gas (2143 cm-1), in contrast to bridging CO - or at 204-6 and 1974 cm -L (and 2008 cm-1), respectively. The single-bonded CO is replaced at low temperatures (Phillips catalyst) or after some days at room tempera ture (Union Carbide catalyst) by bridging CO molecules. These findings support aot only the presence of dinuclear chromium surface complexes, but also further indicate that such surface complexes represent the majority of the chromium. The CO ix. studies make it possible to propose detailed models of the dinuclear chromium surface complexes. The initiation reaction for the polymerization of ethylene could be the addition of one ethylene molecule to one dinuclear surface complex by forming a >M-CH2 CH2_ NIE bridge. Homogeneous analogs for the title catalysts should therefore consist of coordinatively unsaturated dinuclepar complexes, which was not the case in previous studies. Lgt?-oductios Several attempts to convert the heterogeneous Phillips [I - 41 and Union Carbide [5 1 polyethylene catalysts into similarly active homogeneous systems have failed [6 - 9] . To explain this failure, coordination cf reaction *To whom correspondence should be addressed. 248 products [6] or coordinative di.-nerization [8] has been proposed. However, similar poisoning effects should also be possible in the heterogeneous systems. In 1968 it was shown by two different research groups [2, 4] that tile P:iillips catalyst could be reduced to chromium(II) (from chromium(VI)) nearly quantitatively by CO (1 atm, 300 C) [2] and CZI-Lr (1 atm, 135 C) [4] _ The reduced Phillips catalyst was able to polymerize ethylene at room temperature without the induction phase of low activity usually observed f-r the industrial catalyst. It was proposed that during the induction phase the Phillips catalyst is reduced to chromium(II) by ethylene. Therefore, it was concluded that the coordinatively unsaturated chromium(II) surface compound should be the catalytic centre of the Phillips catalyst [2] (or at least its direct precursor). Investigations of this surface compound led to two different structures: mononuclear [10] and dinuelear [11, 12] surface complexes. By re-interpretation of the result that led to the mononuclear structure, however, it could be shown that only dinuclear chromium(II) surface complexes are present in the CO-reduced Phillips catalyst [13] . Recently, it has been shown beyond doubt that a coordinatively unsaturat\"3 surface compound of chromium(III) can also polymerize ethylene at room temperature [14, 1 5] - The aim of the present investigations is to apply i.r. studies of adsorbed CO to the chromocene/SiOZ system and to study the CO poisoning of the three polymerization centres. Experimental The chroinium(II) sample was prepared by impregnating silica gel Merck 7733 - with a chromic acid solution, drying at 120 C in air anti pressing a saa,nle disc (50 mg, dia. 15 - 20 mm). The sample disc was placed, together with 0.5 - 1 g of impregnated silica gel, in a previously described infrared cell [16] . The infrared cell was heated to 800 C under a vacuum and OZ was admitted for 5 - 10 min at 300, 500 and 800 C. The chromium(VI) was reduced with CO at 350 C [13] . infrared spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer spectrophotometer 5803 connected to the Infrared Data Station from the same manufacturer. The silica gel background absorption was subtracted. For the chromium(II) and chromium(III) studies the chromium concerLtration of the impregnation solution was chosen so that tile chromium content of the solid sample was 0.690. The chromium content of the Union Carbide catalyst was not determined. Chromocene [5] was placed as a toluene solution on the bottom of the i.r. cell and sublimed onto the silica gel sample disc (50 mg, pretreated at 700 `C/vac) at up to 90 C under vacuum. Other experimental details are included in the following text. 249 Results and discussion Structure of the chromium(H) and chromium(ffF) surface compounds The two surface compounds can be quantitatively converted into each other [14] - The conversion of chromium(II) to chromium(III) is performed with 1-0/02 at room temperature, and vacuum heat treatment at 800 C, and the reverse reaction is possible with ^hrominm(VI) (02, 800 C) a s an intermediate (reduction at 350 C with C J). Figure 1 shows a difference i.r. spectrum of CO adsorbed at low temperature (-145 C) on these two chromium surface compounds. Figure 2 shows that the chromium(IF) surface compound from Fig. 1 is sometimes accompanied by another with a slightly different configuration, if, for instance, the silica gel is purified with hydrochloric acid [ 13 1 . The change in the spectra is best visible from the absorption around 2035 cm-'-. We have recently [13] interpreted these low temperature i.r. spectra of CO on chromium(II) as being due to four different dinuclear chromium(II) surface complexes. The difference between that interpretation and the present one in Scheme 1 (structures (a) and (b)) is that the bands around 2035 crs ' were previously [13] assigned to special surface complexes, while the bands at 2100 and 2120 cm-' were assigned to horizontally and vertically bridging CO molecules, assuming no vibrational interaction between the bridging COs. In view of the similarity between the above bridging COs and those of the chromocene/Si02 system, all three i.r. bands may arise from three bridging COs, whose vibrations interact. The following arguments support the structures in Scheme 1, especially dinuclear chromium surface complexes and the formation of bridging CO: (1) Reinterpretation of thermogravimetric measurements on the chromium(II) surface compound [10] is in agreement with dinuclear surface ABSORPTION 10_2 I ACr2_ WAVEhuM2ERIcrti 11 229 0 2110011 1 '20100 z S _ -'- 22,00~ .LI100. ~20p0 Fig. I.

The reinterpretation is based on the oxidation of chromium(II) to chromium(III) at high temperatures (up to 700 C) during the thermogravimetric measurements, and therefore also indicates dinuclear chromium(III) surface compounds [13] . (G) CO i.r. bands at 2'_90, 2186 and 2179 cm-\" are replaced at low temperatures by bands at 2120, 2100 and .`=035 cm`_ The i.r. absorption of gaseous CO is at 2143 cm 1. The two -jend groups are therefore shifted in opposite directions. This can be explained by the strong ss effect on singlebonded CO adsorbed on metal(II) cations and r, back donation with no c effect for bridging CO molecules [13] . (3) Stoichiometric measurements showed a decrease of the CO adsorption at low ter:perature [18] . This is best explained by a replacement of two single-bonded CO molecules by one bridging CO. The stoichiometric measurements are in agreement with the replacement of four, single-bonded COs per dinuclear surface compound. With the observation that one bridging CO is adsorbed without displacement of single-bonded CO, this gives three bridging CO molecules per dinuclear surface compound [13] . (4) Paying attention to the small `residual bands' at 2184, 216'0 cm: and at 2195, 2187, 2160 and 2147 cm-1, one O infer two different chromium(II) surface structures (structures (a) and (b) in Scheme 1). From the weak splitting of the bands at 2195 and 2187 cm-' and also of the bands at 2160 and 2147 crR 1. we cc.=iclude that the coupling between bridging and single-bonded CO and between single-bonded CO on different chromium ions of the dinuclear complex is negligible. (5) The above-mentioned easy conversion of the chromium(II) dinuclear surface complex into the chromium(III) surface compound indicates that the latter is also present as a dinuclear surface complex (structure (c) in Scheme 1)_ The trigonal planar configuration can be concluded from 251 the number (one) of CO ir_ vibrations and from the observation that CO is only weakly adsorbed by this surface compound [13) . In view of the polymerization activity, we prefer such a structure to a square planar one with an additional oxygen ligand from the silica gel. Polymerization with chrorniumfr) and chromium(Iffj Figure 3 shows the difference in the low temperature i.r_ CO spectrum before, and after, polymerization with ethylene (100 C, 80 Torr CZH,1, 15 s). Ar new band appeared after polymerization at 2172 cm 1-, which cannot be ascribed to mixed C?H,1/CO complexes on the chromium(II) surface compound (i.r. bands at 2177 and 2184 cm: 1). The bands around 2035 cm-' have alt decreased in a similar way, as did the band at 2120 cm '-. By contrast, the band at 2100 cm -1 has not decreased as strongly. The bar-d at 2172 cm-' is assigned to the stretching vibration of CO poisoning the catalytic centre. Figure 4 shows the effect of ethylene polymerization on the chromium(III) CO i-r_ band. A small amount of chromium(II) was also present in this sample. As the difference spectrum shows, a new band appeared at 2183 cm- 1, which is again assigned to the stretching vibration of CO, now poisoning the chromium(III) catalytic centre. The shift in the i.r_ bands of poisoning CO on chromium(II) (-12 cm-') and on chromium(III) (-17 em') from 2184 and 2200 cO 1, respectively, is in the same direction and of roughly similar amount. One can also conclude from the decrease of the CO i.r. bards on both chromium(II) and chromium(FII) in Fig. 4, that polymerization on chromium(II) and chromium(III) are similar, which was ABSORPTION ASSORPTIOOY 4 T G., 1a1 lI a 1 (~I I t I r I I-, lei i _ _ .. .::- ,.~; ,' . .-_ _ _ : 1 ... _ __ : -- ._ : =.- _ _ ~cl^.:-. :._ ~;_. _ .,. .-. _.',.:-''' ':- -' ''._ WAVENUMBERfcm-11 - WAVEMJl OERIcm 1l 22 00 21 1 20 00 22 'LO 21 20 00 Fig. 3.

Spectrum (c) shows the d_Fference spectrum of the two after normalisation on the band at 2035 cm7l-. 252 observed before [14] using a different measurement technique. A similar polymerization mechanism must therefore hold for both catalytic centres. The structure of the chromocenelst02 catalyst Figure 5 shows the difference i.r. spectrum of silica gel before and after reaction with chromocene (spectrunx (,-)). Silanol groups (3743 cm 1) have reacted with chromocene. while a shift to 3594 cm- 3L is also observed. This shift is possibly caused by a weak, interaction with CEO groups from the cyclopentadienyl group (3098, 2953, 292? and 2873 cm-1). Additional bands are at 1720 and 1659 cm-1. Y'sfter adsorption of CO, five nE w i.r. bands appeared, besides the doubling of the intensity of the band at 3098 cm-1 (now shifted to 3110 cm-1): 2 346, 1974, 1920, 1825, and 16' 0 cm-1 (Fig. 5, difference spectrum (b)). The first two bands disappear on evacu ation at room temperature, while a new, very weak band at 2008 cm-1 appears. The other three CO i.r. bands -ire removed only at temperatures between 150 and 200 C under vacuum. As can be seen from the difference spectrum (c) (Fig. 5), the bands at (r,ow) 2049 and 1982 cm-1 decreased after 16 h and three new bands appeared at 1884, 1763, and 1460 cm-1. The ;utter three CO i.r. bands are note shifted considerably from those observed immediately after CO adsorption. From spectrum (c) one can also conclude that the increase in intensity of the band at 3110 cm 1 is associated with the appearance ssf the three lower wavenumber bands, rather than with that of the two other banc'_s. On the basis of the above obser rations and with structures postulated by other authors [5] in mind, it seems reasonable to assign the bands at 2046 and 1974 cm -1- to a cyclopen~adienylchromium surface oxide with two single-bonded CO molecules (stricture (b) in Scheme 2).

The i.r. band at 2008 crQ 1 can similarly be explained as due to one single-bonded CO molecule adsorbed on the above chromium surface oxide (structure (a) in Scheme 2). On the basis that this i.r. band lies nearly midway (2010 cO 1) between the two CO bands zt 2046 and 1974 cra 1, we favour a surface complex Oth two CO molecules for the latter two i.r. bands. If these two bands were produced by three adsorbed CO molecules, the single band would be expected at 1998 cm 1. The CH vibrations of the cyclopentadienyl group for the above two compounds [17] were found at 3096, ? etr-1 (question mark -_; in the reference) and at 3096, 2967 cO 1, respectively. The i.r bands in Fig. 5, spectO (a), arise possibly also from toluene adsorbed on the silica gel. Between the two groups of CO i.r. bands at 1920, 1825, and 1620 cm-1. and those observed at low temperatures on the dinuclear chromium(11) surface complex at 2120, 2100, and 2035 cm 1, there eat three s:milaz-ities: (1) both have three i.r. bands, (2) both can shift to lower wavenumbers as if connected, anal (3) Even the relative intensities of the i.r. bands can be similar (Fig. 1 compared with spectrum (c) in Fig. 5). Therefore we assign the three bands at 1920, 1825, and 1620 cm 1 to a dinuclear cyclopentadieny1chromium surface oxide complex with three bridging CO molecules, as shown in structure (c), Scheme 2. Polymerisation with chromocenelSi02 Figure 6 s-hows spectra after polymerization of ethylene on the Union Carbide catalyst. 1n. the difference spectO (b), one can see the produced polyethylene at 2 28 and 2853 cuz ' , of which a varying amount interacts with some of the silanol groups from the silica gel. This interaction produces a shift of the i.r. band at 2928 to 2900 cni-1. The relative intensities of the two bands depend on the length of the polymer chain and the number of the siIanol grot,.ps.

Difference spectra of the polymerization with ethylene on a chromocene/silica gel catalyst after previous poisoning with CO followed by evacuation (spectrum (a)). Spectrum (b) is the same as spectrum (b) from Fig. 6_ after adsorption of CO. Comparing this spectrum with spectrum (b) in Fig. 5, one can conclude that the bands at 1920 and 1620 cm-1 have decreased, while the other three bands are nearly unchanged in intensity. It was also observed that no polymerization occurred if CO was admitted to the catalyst followed by evacuation at room tempeiature (Fig. 7, spectrum (a)). The CH i.r. bands now look more like those of an olefin, possibly ei.her released cyclopentadiene or adsorbed ethylene. Because evacuation at room temperature destroys the complexes with singlebonded CO molecules (i.r. bands at 2046 and 1974 cm '-; mononuclear complexes), only the dinuclear cyclopentadienylchromium surface oxides cari be active centres in the Union Carbide catalyst. A mechanism for the polymerization of ethylene An often overlooked problem of polymerization mechanisms far the Phillips and Union Carbide catalysts is the missing hydrogen in the initiation reaction. A solution to this problem is the assumption of metallacycles as starting compounds. One of us has previously [18] proposed such a metallapentacycle for the Phillips catalyst, based on the assumption that mononuclear catalytic centres existed. On the basis of dinuclear catalytic centres, the initiation reaction can be even simpler by assuming the insertion of one ethylene molecule between the two metal atoms of a dinuclear complex (S.3heme 3). In such a reaction model, no C-H bond has to be broken, which is, however, the case if the polymer leaves the catalytic centre. Polymerization may proceed by the Cossee mechanism and the catalytic centre O be poisoned by CO, as shown in structure (e) in Scheme 3. The same mecha- 255 Si '`22t o/ r e H Cr/ /I\\ H i~ \\ ( bl ~'-H- ~~o / O~ ~RAS Si i t!i /I\\ o/``~-C _ ~C ~, /I\\ I H H Si H C -H CO S~ /I\\ N H o /I\\ o (cl \\~ ,si (dl /c\\H ~ ', /I\\ C\\ (el SCHEME 3 ~Ii H-` c-\" H N nism can be applied to the other two active catalysts above, if minor changes are made. Returning to the attempts to convert the two polyethylene catalysts into homogeneous systems, we suggest in the case of bis(triphenylsilyl)chromate [6] , that the much higher pressure necessary for polymerization (at least one order of magnitude) may be explained by assuming a metallapentacycle mechanism [18] . In the case of chromorganyls [7] the oxygen bridge between the two. chromium ions will most likely also be split during dissolution and so destroy the catalytic centre. For cyclopentadienylchromium oxides [8] and chromiurn(II) alcoholates [9] , coordinative, dior polymerization most likely prevents catalytic activity. Breaking the coordinative bonds, for instance, on reaction with ethylene, will produce mononuclear complexes. Therefore the faaure in the attempts to convert the two cattalysts into homogeneous systems may be generalised as a failure in synthesizing coordinatively unsaturated dinuclear chromium(II) (or chromium(III)) complexes.

Both title catalysts show strong i.r. bands after adsorption of CO, which are assigned to bridging CO molecules. These CO i.r. bands are at 2120, 2100 and 2035 cm−1 at low temperatures (−145 °C) for the CO-reduced Phillips catalyst (Zecchina , 1975) or at 1920, 1825 and 1620 cm−1 (Union Carbide catalyst).Single-bonded CO is observed showing i.r. bands at 2190, 2186 and 2179 cm−1—shifted to higher wavenumbers than CO gas (2143 cm−1), in contrast to bridging CO — or at 2046 and 1974 cm− (and 2008 cm−1), respectively. The single-bonded CO is replaced at low temperatures (Phillips catalyst) or after some days at room temperature (Union Carbide catalyst) by bridging CO molecules. These findings support not only the presence of dinuclear chromium surface complexes, but also further indicate that such surface complexes represent the majority ofthe chromium. The CO i.r. studies make it possible to propose detailed models of the dinuclear chromium surface complexes. The initiation reaction for the polymerization of ethylene could be the addition of one ethylene molecule to one dinuclear surface complex by forming a bridge. Homogeneous analogs for the title catalysts should therefore consist of coordinatively unsaturated dinuclear complexes, which was not the case in previous studies. References 1 A. Clark J.P.
