STRADELLA Istituto di Chimica Generate ed Inorganica, Facolta di Farmacia, Via P. Giuria 9, 10125 Turin (Italy) (Received February 26, 1987; accepted July 6, 1987) Summary Calorimetric adsorption measurements of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide have been performed on bismuth molybdate (2:1) at 300 K. The basicity of the sample is low and the adsorption of a 'soft' base such as carbon monoxide is small. On the other hand, the acidity titrated by a 'hard' base like ammonia is high. A kinetic and calorimetric study has shown that a CO-O; mixture may interact at 300 K on the molybdate surface. Introduction A large number of investigations have been performed on bismuth molybdate catalysts because of their selectivity in oxidizing and ammoxi- dating olefins [1, 2]. Recently Ai and Ikawa have suggested that the selecti- vity in oxidation processes can be correlated to the acidity of the catalyst [3]. The acidic and basic properties of solid surfaces have been determined using several techniques [4], but the gaseous adsorption method seems to give results that are more properly correlated to heterogeneously catalyzed reactions [5]. In this work, ammonia and carbon dioxide were chosen as adsorbates to determine respectively the acidity and basicity of Bi^Oy- Mo03. Experimental The sample of Bi203-Mo03 was prepared according to Batiste? al. [6]; its X-ray diagram coincided with that cited in the literature [7]. Its specific surface amounts to 7.8 m2 g~1. The oxidized sample, cited here as (BilOa-Mo03)ox, was standardized by heating in vacuum (10~4 Pa) for 30 min at 473 K and by oxidizing at 623 K for 1 h under 6.650 Pa of oxygen. 0304-6102/88/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 328 The reduced sample, (Bi^Oy- MoOs^ed. was obtained by submitting the standardized sample to a pressure of 6.650 Pa of hydrogen at 623 K for 30 min; the global reduction percentage was 0.91% [8]. The adsorption measurements were performed at 420 K employing a Tian-Calvet microcalorimeter connected to a grease-free vacuum line. The details of the measurement method are described elsewhere [9]. All the gases employed were spectroscopically pure and supplied by S.I.O. (Italy). All adsorption-desorption runs were repeated twice to check repro- ducibility. Results and discussion In Fig. 1 the calorimetric adsorption-desorption isotherms of carbon dioxide (e.g. the integral heat of adsorption as a function of equilibrium pressure) are shown for (BiaOa-MoOa^ed and (BizOa-MoOa^x. The volu- metric isotherms show a similar trend and for simplicity are not reported here. It can be seen that the oxidized sample exhibits higher heats of adsorption than the reduced sample, as well as greater adsorbed amounts (in the volumetric isotherms not reported here). From the desorption curve, one may deduce that on both samples only a small fraction (2 - 3%) is irreversibly adsorbed. The overall coverage of 002 on these samples is, however, small and therefore the surface basicity seems very low: this fact will be discussed later. In Fig. 3a, the differential heats of CO; adsorption are reported as a function of adsorbed amounts. Only a small fraction of sites (~ 1 /imol m~2) have an interaction energy greater than 80 kJ mol~1 and these are probably the sites responsible for the irreversible adsorption of carbon dioxide.

A A (BiaOyMoOa^x- 329 The intermediate range heats of adsorption (80-10 kJ mol\"1) are typical of the interaction of polar gases with ionic sorbents, and are probably the result of electrostatic contributions [10]. Beyond a coverage of 4 jumol m~2, there are only weak, non-specific interactions. In Fig. 2 we give the calorimetric adsorption-desorption isotherms for carbon monoxide; the volumetric isotherms not reported here are similar. The corresponding energy (see Fig. 3b) is low and typical of the van der Waals interaction, as expected for a completely reversible adsorption. On the basis of these results, one should exclude the existence on both samples of either excess surface oxygen ions or anionic or cationic vacancies, as they seem to be able to chemisorb or react with carbon monoxide [11]. A low surface coverage of a reduced molybdena by chemisorbed CO has already been reported [12]. The results in this work and those previously published [13, 14] are similar to those obtained on a hexagonal molybdenum oxide [15]. In that case, the difference in adsorption between the two groups of gases (CO, CO;) and (H^O, N113) was interpreted in terms of different molecular 3 4-; ((Jmol-m ) Fig. 2.

In the case of BizOa'MoC^, the presence of cavities in the crystal structure is hardly credibile, and furthermore we have shown that a mild reduction treatment that does not change the structure markedly enhances the adsorption of ammonia and water [13,14]. The interpretation scheme we prefer starts from the fact that bismuth molybdate has semiconductor properties, and reduction treatment enhances the conductivity as a high vacancy density is introduced [16]. The oxide ion vacancy may leave a 'neutral' or 'positively charged' local site whether or not the electrons are retained [11]. In the latter case, the anion vacancy may act as an electron exchange centre. Bearing this in mind, the behaviour of the two molybdate samples might be explained as follows: (i) the mild reduction treatment leaves partially occupied vacancy sites which either can interact with dioxygen to form peroxo surface species [14] or can chemisorb electron donor molecules such as water [14] or ammonia [13]. With a less basic and less polar ligand like CO the interaction is weak, weaker than with a Tr-donor such as propene [17]; (ii) the loss of surface oxygen reduces the number of basic centres on (Bi:;03' MoC>3)red able to interact with carbon dioxide to form carbonate or bicarbonate species. The chemisorbed carbon dioxide level is not very high on (Bi203-Mo03)ox> confirming that little surface basicity exists on bismuth molybdate (2:1). Some data concerning the acidity-basicity of bismuth molybdate have been collected in Table 1. It is well known that ammonia adsorption can reveal both Lewis and Bronsted acidity, and that for carbon dioxide it should be necessary to distinguish between the linear-shaped dioxide (typical of Lewis acidity) and carbonate or bicarbonate-like species typical of surface basicity [18]. Apart from these fine details, it is clear that Bi2C>3' Mo03 belongs to the group of solid acids, confirming the thesis according to which acidity is TABLE l Acid-base properties of bismuth molybdate Sample Acidity\" Basicity1' Reference (BilOyMoOs^ed 7.14 (JLtmol m~2) 0.028 (fJtmol m~2) this work 0.22 (J m-2) 2.8 X 10-4 (J m-2) (Bi203-MoC>3)ox 0.29 (jumol m~2) 0.06 (jUmol m~2) this work 7.7 X 10\"\"4 (J m-2) 1.28 X 10~3 (J m-2) Bi^Oa-MoOs 0.28 (jUmol m-2) 31 BiaOa-MoOa-PzOs 1.30 (llmolm~2) 0.35 (pmol nT2) 19 \"Acidity = amount (JUmol m~2) or integral heat (J m~2) of NN3 irreversibly adsorbed.

However, from the data of Table 1 it may be also noted that besides the overall stoichiometry of the solid, the local environment of the site is an important parameter which may change with the coordination number and with the oxidation state of the cation. These local factors (electron accepting ability and surface structure of the site) seem to be strongly involved in the acid-base properties of bismuth molybdate, as have already been observed for other oxides [20]. Another aspect of surface acidity that is not always fully considered is the role of the adsorbate: in order to refer to the same concept of acidity, the principles of 'hard and soft acids and bases' (HSAB) may be usefully recalled [21, 22]. In our case, for instance, a 'soft' base like CO cannot chemisorb at those acidic centres whose polarizing fields strongly interact with a 'hard' base like ammonia. The heterogeneous oxidation of carbon monoxide holds an important place in both industrial and physical chemistry and has been the subject of several studies [23 - 25]. In Fig. 4 we give some results of a study of the thermokinetics of CO-Oz interaction on Bi^O^'MoO^ at 300 K. We report the z-t plot [26], i.e. the reciprocal of the heat flux as a function of time. The onset of a chemical interaction may be inferred by the following: (i) Too (The time necessary for returning to experimental zero) for the gas mixture is about fifty times the Too observed for the single gas adsorption; (ii) the application of the z-t method (see Fig. 4) shows the existence of an extend- ed linear portion (Elovichian plot) typical of chemical reactions. Further- more, the reaction rate seems to be independent from the reagent pressure, as observed on ?0 [27]; (iii) the heat of adsorption of the mixture (50 kJ mol~1) is about ten times higher than that of the single CO on the bare surface of (Bi203- Mo03)red (~5 kJ mol\"1) at the same equilibrium pressure. From these preliminary results it is not possible to obtain precise data for some thermochemical cycles of CO oxidation, but they are similar to those obtained in the case of propene and ammonia mixtures with oxygen dOirt-i dt 100 200 300 t (min) Fig. 4. z-t plot for the interaction of carbon monoxide with oxygen on (Bi203-Mo03)ox at 305 K: 0 total pressure = 13.905 KPa, total pressure = 20.664 KPa. 332 [28]; it seems therefore confirmed that the catalytic activity of Biat^-MoC^ at low temperature is determined primarily by the number and the nature of the lattice defects produced by the reduction treatment; these surface irre- gularities might be connected with the increase in surface acidity. Never- theless, it must be pointed out that, despite the great number of studies on the subject, there is no agreement between the acid-base properties and the catalytic behaviour in oxidation reactions [29]. It is still open to discussion whether it is necessary to distinguish between oxido-reduction properties (formally, charge transfer processes) and Lewis acidity-basicity (formally, electron doublet donating-accepting) [30]. Conclusions Adsorption microcalorimetry seems to be a useful tool for investigating the acid-base properties of solid catalysts. Calorimetric measurements confirm that the surface of bismuth molyb- date (2:1) has an acidic nature, as it strongly adsorbs ammonia but weakly interacts with carbon dioxide. Besides the overall stoichiometry of the solid catalyst, there are other local factors (electron acceptivity and surface structures of the site) that drastically affect the acidity of the molybdate. A thermokinetic study consisting in the application of the z-t method has allowed us to show that some interaction occurs at 300 K between carbon monoxide and dioxygen adsorbed on the bismuth molybdate sample. Further calorimetric measurements on variously reduced molybdate samples and some spectroscopic determinations are being made at our Institute to confirm the correlation between surface acidity and catalytic activity.
