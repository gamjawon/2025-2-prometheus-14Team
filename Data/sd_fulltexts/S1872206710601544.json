DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(10)60154-4 SURVEY PAPER Progress in Ru-Based Amorphous Alloy Catalysts for Selective Hydrogenation of Benzene to Cyclohexene SUN Haijie, GUO Wei, ZHOU Xiaoli, CHEN Zhihao, LIU Zhongyi*, LIU Shouchang Department of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, Henan, China Abstract: Ru-based amorphous alloy catalysts prepared by the chemical reduction method have high activity and excellent cyclohexene selectivity due to their structure that has the merits of amorphous alloys and nano-particles. In particular, the supported catalysts have the advantages of better utilization of the Ru noble metal and ease of use in industry. The thermodynamics and kinetics for selective hydro- genation of benzene to cyclohexene over these catalysts, and the influence of the structure and composition of the catalysts were described. The reaction conditions, ability to modify the catalysts, and results of pilot tests were emphasized. Directions in this field for future research were suggested. Key words: benzene; selective hydrogenation; cyclohexene; amorphous alloy; ruthenium-based catalyst The production of nylon 6 and nylon 66 from benzene and cyclohexene has attracted much attention because this is a safe and environmentally benign process with atomic economy, and is preferred to the route from benzene and cyclohexane [1â€“9]. In 1989, Asahi Chemical Company industrialized the process for the selective hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexene using an unsupported Ru-Zn catalyst that had high activity and excellent cyclohexene selectivity [10]. However, the catalytic efficiency in terms of the utilization per unit mass of Ru was low, the catalyst had poor resistance to S, Cl, and Fe, and was costly [11]. Furthermore, the preparation technology of the catalyst has not been licensed so far. Since the 1990s, Chinese universities and research institutes have studied this reaction and developed novel catalysts and catalytic technologies [12â€“16]. The research results with supported amorphous alloys have been most remarkable for their high activity and excellent selectivity due to their short range ordering and long range disordered structure and high concentration of coordinatively unsaturated sites [17]. Thus amorphous alloy nano-particles have received increasing attention as novel catalytic materials since 1981 [18]. In 1999, Xie et al. [19] reported that a Ru-B amorphous alloy catalyst prepared by a chemical reduction method gave a cyclohexene yield from the selective hydro- genation of benzene of 31.2%. This led to Ru-based amorphous alloy catalysts becoming the focus of the research on novel catalytic materials for the selective hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexene. Zhengzhou University [20,21], Fudan Uni- versity [22], Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics [23], and Sinopec Corp. Research Institute of Petroleum Processing [24] have received patents for the preparation methods of amor- phous alloy catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of ben- zene to cyclohexene. Progress in amorphous alloy catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexene is re- viewed in this article, with the emphasis on the research results of Zhengzhou University. 1 Thermodynamics and kinetics of selective hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexene The thermodynamics indicate it would be difficult to get cyclohexene from benzene because the standard free energy change for cyclohexene formation from benzene hydrogena- tion is â€“23 kJ/mol, while that for cyclohexane formation is â€“98 kJ/mol. The mechanism for benzene hydrogenation proposed by Prasad et al. [25] has been generally accepted. The main features of it are the simultaneous presence of two reaction SUN Haijie et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1â€“16 routes. Route 1 is consecutive hydrogenation, in which ben- zene is successively hydrogenated to cyclohexane from cyclohexadiene and cyclohexene. Route 2 is one step hydro- genation of benzene to cyclohexane. Therefore, in order to improve the yield of cyclohexene, it is necessary to stop the further hydrogenation of cyclohexene and inhibit the complete hydrogenation of benzene. Hydrophilic modification of the Ru-based catalyst is one of the most effective ways to achieve this effect. This was first proposed by Struijk et al. [5,6] and has been confirmed by the observation that the cyclohexene yield is closely related to the hydrophilicity of support [26,27]. It was further proved by the solubility of benzene and cyclohexene in water. The solubility of benzene in water is 125 mol/m 3 , which is 6 times that of cyclohexene (21 mol/m 3 ). Thus the stagnant water layer on the catalyst surface would increase the concen- tration of benzene, which promotes desorption of cyclohexene from the catalyst surface by competitive adsorption. In addition, the stagnant water layer can effectively prevent the further hydrogenation of cyclohexene to cyclohexane because of the low solubility of cyclohexene in water. This is depicted in Fig. 1. This hydrophilic modification is now an important guiding principle for the development of catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexene. The kinetic equations for the selective hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexene over a Ru-Zn-B/ZrO 2 catalyst have been established by our group [28] for the case where the one step hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane can be neglected (because a tri-molecular reaction is very rare).

The reaction order for cyclohexene was zero, and the reaction or- ders for hydrogen at low, middle, high pressure were two, fractional, and zero, respectively. This implied that the catalyst surface rapidly adsorbed cyclohexene and was saturated by it. However, the adsorption of hydrogen was related to the pres- sure of hydrogen and the surface can reach saturated adsorption of hydrogen only at a high enough pressure of hydrogen. Hence, the selective hydrogenation of benzene is generally carried out at a H 2 pressure of 5.0 MPa. As can be seen from Eq. (3), the increase in k 1 and the decrease in k 2 would enhance the selec- tivity for cyclohexene. It was found that a hydrophilic catalyst or the addition of a substance that enhanced the hydrophilicity of the catalyst would increase k 1 and decrease k 2 . 2 Structure and formation of a Ru-based amorphous alloy catalyst 2.1 Amorphous structure and crystallite size effects Xie et al. [19] reported that the activity and cyclohexene selectivity over an amorphous Ru-B/SiO 2 catalyst were both higher than those over a crystalline Ru-B/SiO 2 catalyst due to the structural effect of the amorphous alloy. Our group [29,30] have prepared Ru-M-B/ZrO 2 (M = Zn, Co, and Fe) nano-amorphous alloy catalysts. The Ru crystalline sizes of these catalysts were in range of 3.6â€“5.3 nm. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and selected area electron diffrac- tion (SAED) images are shown in Fig. 2. The cyclohexene selectivity reached 80.0% at a benzene conversion of 54.8% at 25 min over the Ru-Fe-B/ZrO 2 catalyst. We proposed that the special properties of the catalysts were derived from the com- bination of the nano-scale size of the particles and the amor- phous materials, which gave high activity and excellent selec- tivity. Bu et al. [8] reported that the highest cyclohexene yield was obtained over the Ru-Ba/SBA-15 catalyst with a Ru crystalline size of 5.6 nm, and suggested that this crystallite size of Ru had the highest amount of the active sites favorable for the production of cyclohexene. Nagahara et al. [10] re- ported that the Ru crystalline size of Asahiâ€™s Ru-Zn catalyst was also about 5 nm. These results indicate that the amorphous structure and crystallite size effects play a key role in the catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of benzene. 2.2 Boron effects Xie et al. [19] prepared a supported Ru-B/SiO 2 catalyst by impregnation and chemical reduction. The benzene conversion over this catalyst was 3.2%/(gÂ·h) and the cyclohexene selec- H H d i f f i c u l t e a s y Stagnant water layer Catalyst Fig. 1. Effect of the stagnant water layer on benzene hydrogenation. SUN Haijie et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1â€“16 tivity was 49.7%, which were much better than the activity (2.3%/(gÂ·h)) and selectivity (22.2%) over a Ru/SiO 2 catalyst with the same Ru loading obtained by H 2 reduction. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Ar + etching results suggested that the B in the Ru-B/SiO 2 catalyst existed in the two forms of the elemental and oxidative states, and was en- riched on the catalyst surface. Some electrons were transferred from elemental B to metallic Ru, making Ru electron rich. They suggested that the hydrophilic modification of the cata- lyst by B was one of the most important factors responsible for the high activity and excellent cyclohexene selectivity. On the one hand, oxidative states of boron species dispersed on the catalyst surface can bond water molecules through hydrogen bonding. On the other hand, electron transfer from elemental B to Ru made the elemental B electron deficient and the electron deficient B can more easily accept the lone electron pair on the oxygen of water. Therefore, the hydrophilicity of the catalyst was enhanced and the selectivity for cyclohexene was in- creased. Liu et al. [31] prepared a series of Ru-B catalysts with different B contents by chemical reduction, and found that with the increase of the B content from 0 to 10.1%, cyclohexene yield increased from 6.3% to 30.4% and cyclohexene selec- tivity increased from 19.4% to 50.8%. This is shown in Table 1. It indicated that by varying the B content in Ru-B amorphous alloys, the activity and cyclohexene selectivity can be signifi- cantly enhanced. Besides the reduction temperature, the pH value during the dropwise addition of NaBH 4 [32], the con- centration and addition rate of NaBH 4 [30,33â€“35] also can modify the B content in the amorphous alloy catalyst. There- fore, these conditions should be specially noted during the preparation of the amorphous alloy catalysts. 2.3 Promoter effects It was reported that some promoters such as Fe, Zn, La, Ce, and Co at some loadings can increase the cyclohexene selec- tivity and decrease the activity, and other promoters can in- crease both cyclohexene selectivity and the activity. The effects of these can be slightly different with different preparation methods [36â€“42]. Generally, the roles of promoters are attrib- uted to the electronic and structural effects. Fan et al. [36] prepared a Ru-Co-B/È–-Al 2 O 3 catalyst and found that the Co in the catalyst was in an oxidized state and there was partial electron transfer from Ru to Co. The formation of Ru Ä¯+ gave a much smaller reduction peak of Ru(III), which was confirmed by XPS and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR). Thus they suggested the presence of Ru Ä¯+ improved cyclohexene selectivity since cyclohexene was weakly adsorbed and easily desorbed from Ru Ä¯+ species. Our group has reported XPS data [37,38] that showed that La also existed in an oxidized state and there was partial electron transfer from La to Ru. Moreover, La in the oxidized state can be reduced to the metal with a long reaction time. We also found that most of the promoters that improve cyclohexene selectivity were transitional metals. Although these metals showed no catalytic activity for hy- drogenation, they had vacant d-orbitals that can interact with the ÊŒ-electrons of cyclohexene and pull cyclohexene away from Ru. This would result in the immediate desorption of cyclohexene once it was formed [39â€“41]. All these supported the existence of an electronic interaction between the promoter and Ru that affected the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. 20 nm Fig. 2.

SUN Haijie et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1â€“16 Some promoters also act as structural modifiers. The roles of a structural promoter are attributed to the following: (1) increase the dispersion of the active component and depress the ag- glomeration of the Ru active component [36]; (2) block the active sites on which the hydrogenation of cyclohexene occurs rapidly and provide an unsuitable environment for the hydro- genation of cyclohexene [36,40]; (3) improve the stability of the Ru-B/ZrO 2 amorphous alloy catalyst and delay the crystal- lization of the amorphous alloy [42]; (4) make the Ru-B active component disperse well and provide a homogenous coordi- nation environment for the active component [42]. It is found that the precursor of the promoter, distribution of the promoter, and residual NaOH formed during the reduction also have large effects on the performance of the catalyst. Our group [43] introduced Cu into the Ru-Fe-B/ZrO 2 catalyst and prepared a catalyst with two promoters. We found that the activity of the Ru-Fe-Cu-B/ZrO 2 catalyst did not decrease when compared with the Ru-Fe-B/ZrO 2 catalyst, but the se- lectivity of the former increased slightly. We also showed that the use of CuCl 2 Â·2H 2 O as the precursor had a better effect on the enhancement of the activity and cyclohexene selectivity than CuSO 4 Â·5H 2 O. We proposed that on the one hand Cl preferentially adsorbed on the active sites and the adsorption of cyclohexene on the remaining active sites was weak. This favored the desorption of cyclohexene and increased cyclo- hexene selectivity. On the other hand, Cl adsorbed on the catalyst surface can bond water molecules through hydrogen bonding. This enhanced the hydrophilicity of the catalyst and improved cyclohexene selectivity. However, SO 4 2 had no such functions. Qin et al [41] prepared an unsupported Ru-Zn-B catalyst and found that the feed method affected the distribu- tion of the Zn content on the catalyst. They suggested that in the use of the inverse addition method (the mixed solution of RuCl 3 and ZnSO 4 was dropped into the solution of NaBH 4 ), the amount of NaBH 4 was much more than that needed for the reduction of Ru 3+ and Zn 2+ throughout the reduction process, which ensured the simultaneous reduction of Ru 3+ and Zn 2+ . Thus the distributions of the Ru and Zn contents were uniform, which was responsible for the high activity and excellent cyclohexene selectivity of catalysts prepared by this method. However, in the direct addition method (the solution of NaBH 4 was added to the mixed solution of RuCl 3 and ZnSO 4 ), Ru 3+ was preferentially reduced and the Ru active sites were covered by the later reduced Zn, which led to the decrease in the activity. Qin et al. [41] and our group [30] also investigated the effect of residual of NaOH on the performance of catalyst. The results showed that the catalyst exhibited good performance when the pH value of the filtrate was 8 or 7.5, that is, a small amount of NaOH remained on the surface of the catalyst. We suggested that the alkali metal ions left acted as an electronic promoter. Meanwhile, the OH left both enhanced the hydrophilicity of the catalyst and also reacted easily with Zn 2+ in the slurry to form a small amount of Zn(OH) 2 , which were both favorable to the increase of cyclohexene selectivity. The effects of different promoters on the performance of amorphous alloy catalysts are shown in Table 2. 2.4 Support effects Wang et al. [27] prepared a Ru-B/Al 2 O 3 Â·xH 2 O catalyst and a Ru-B/È–-Al 2 O 3 catalyst by a combined coprecipitation-crystal- lization-reduction strategy and found that the activity and cyclohexene selectivity of the former were superior to the latter. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and TEM results showed that the former had a higher dispersion of much smaller RuB particles. Thus the former possessed more active sites and exhibited the higher activity. The thermal analysis (TG/DTA) results showed that the superior selectivity of the former was attributable to the existence of more structural water and surface hydroxyl groups on the former than those on the latter. Ning et al. [44,45] pre- pared three kinds of catalysts: RuCl, RuS1, and RuS2 by mi- croemulsion processing and the hydrolysis product of tetra- ethyl orthosilicate as the support, microemulsion processing and a commercial silica as the support, and the conventional impregnation-chemical reduction method, respectively. They found that the RuCl catalyst gave a higher activity and better cyclohexene selectivity. XRD and TEM results showed that RuC1and RuS1 showed a higher activity than RuS2 because of a smaller Ru particle size and more specific surface. There were more exposed active sites on the two former catalysts prepared by microemulsion processing. The superior cyclo- hexene selectivity over the RuC1 catalyst might be attributed to the much higher content of surface hydroxyl groups and zinc compounds, which resulted in a large enhancement of the hydrophilicity of the catalyst. Our group [29,46] prepared Ru-M-B/ZrO 2 catalysts, and found that the catalyst prepared with the addition of ZrO 2 before the reduction exhibited the best cyclohexene selectivity, and the optimal Ru/ZrO 2 ratio was in the range of 0.13 to 0.16. Below this range the activity and the cyclohexene selectivity were both very low. When the ratio was above 0.16, the activity of the catalyst was improved but the cyclohexene selectivity was decreased. With the addition of some amount of ZrO 2 as support, the dispersion of the active component of Ru was increased, which led to an adequate contact between Ru active sites and benzene and the en- Table 2 Effects of some promoters on the performance of amorphous alloy catalysts for benzene hydrogenation to cyclohexene Sample Time (min) X BZ /% S HE /% Ref.

Moreover, the exis- tence of hydrophilic ZrO 2 resulted in the formation of a stag- nant water layer on the surface of the catalyst, which promoted desorption of cyclohexene, suppressed the further hydrogena- tion of cyclohexene, and enhanced cyclohexene selectivity. We also investigated the influence of the calcination temperature of ZrO 2 on the performance of a Ru-Fe-B/ZrO 2 catalyst, and found that the activity decreased and cyclohexene selectivity increased with increased calcination temperature [47]. We suggested that the decrease of the activity was related to the decrease of the support specific surface area, and the increase of the cyclohexene selectivity was due not only to the decrease of the support specific surface area but also to the increase in pore diameter and increase in the monoclinic ZrO 2 phase with a high surface hydroxyl content, in agreement with the conclu- sion in the literature [48]. This suggested that supports with strong hydrophilicity, medium specific surface area and large pores, and a simple pore structure were suitable for supporting the catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexene. 3 Hydrogenation condition effects 3.1 Reaction temperature It was reported that the cyclohexene selectivity first in- creased and then decreased with the increase of the temperature [44,45,49,50]. The literature [49,50] used the enthalpy change and Arrhenius equation and Ning et al. [44,45] used the solu- bility of the reactant and molecular kinetic theory to explain this. XRD results showed that the diffraction peaks of the catalyst after the hydrogenation were sharper, which indicated an increase of the crystallite size. A higher temperature gave a larger crystallite size. The Ru crystallite sizes of the catalyst after the hydrogenation were 4.49, 5.08, and 5.59 nm, respec- tively, at 145, 153, and 179 o C [50]. The obvious diffraction peaks of NaBO 3 observed in the XRD patterns of the catalyst after hydrogenation indicated the gradual decomposition of the amorphous alloy [46]. This may be one of the main reasons for the decrease of cyclohexene selectivity when the reaction temperature exceeded 140 o C. 3.2 Hydrogen pressure Ning et al. [44,45] investigated the effect of hydrogen pres- sure on the performance of the RuCl catalyst and found that cyclohexene yield first increased and then decreased with increasing pressure, and the optimum pressure was 6 MPa. They suggested that this can be ascribed to the following two effects. (1) The routes of the hydrogenation of benzene were influenced by the hydrogen pressure. The consecutive hydro- genation mechanism dominated at low molar ratios of benzene to hydrogen, and the one step hydrogenation mechanism be- came more important at higher benzene pressure. Under a low hydrogen pressure, increasing hydrogen pressure would de- crease benzene partial pressure at the surface of ruthenium. Thus, this benefited benzene hydrogenation by the consecutive mechanism, and the probability of the formation of cyclohex- ene was greatly increased and the cyclohexene selectivity was enhanced. However, the rate of cyclohexene hydrogenation to cyclohexane would also increase when there was an excessive amount of hydrogen on the surface. As a result, the selectivity for cyclohexene would decline with the further increase of the pressure. (2) The rates of hydrogenation of the reactant ben- zene and cyclohexene were different functions of the hydrogen pressure, and the hydrogenation rate of these would change with the hydrogen pressure. The rate of benzene to cyclohex- ene would increase gradually with an increase in hydrogen pressure to a maximum corresponding to the optimal surface coverage of benzene and hydrogen. However, at higher hy- drogen pressure, a smaller portion of empty active sites avail- able for benzene would give a lower hydrogenation rate for benzene. At the same time, cyclohexene was easily hydrogen- ated to cyclohexane when there was an excessive amount of hydrogen on the surface. Wu et al. [49] also observed this same phenomenon over a Ru-Co-B supported catalyst. Our group reported that the optimum hydrogen pressure was 4â€“5 MPa over the Ru-M-B/ZrO 2 catalyst [50]. 3.3 Stirring rate Mass transport plays a dominant role in the cyclohexene yield and selectivity in the reaction. When the reaction reaches a steady state, a stagnant water layer forms on the surface of the catalyst and a concentration gradient on the surface of the catalyst exists. In this multiphase reaction, increasing the stir- ring rate is beneficial for getting a better dispersion of the catalyst particles. Meanwhile, increasing the stirring rate is also favorable for better dispersion of smaller droplets of the or- ganic phase in the water and enlarges the contact area between the gas, solid, and liquid. Thus mass transfer is accelerated, promoting desorption of cyclohexene and suppressing further hydrogenation of cyclohexene. Ning et al. [44,45] reported that cyclohexene selectivity increased when the stirring rate was increased from 400 to 800 r/min, but above 800 r/min the cyclohexene selectivity increase was not obvious. It was re- ported that external diffusion limitation can be eliminated at stirring rates above 900 r/min for the Ru-M-B/ZrO 2 catalyst [50], and above 700 r/min for the Ru-Co-B/support catalyst [49]. This indicated different stirring rates were needed to eliminate external diffusion limitation for different catalysts. In addition, Wu et al. [49] also found that particles of the catalyst adhered to the inner wall of the reactor when the stirring rate exceeded 900 r/min, which resulted in a decrease of the reac- tion rate. This suggested that the stirring rate should not be too high. SUN Haijie et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1â€“16 3.4 Additive The addition of inorganic and organic additives is one of the most important methods for improving cyclohexene selectivity. Among these, the inorganic additives, especially ZnSO 4 , gave the best effect. The roles of ZnSO 4 can be attributed to the following three reasons. (1) Adsorption of Zn 2+ on the surface of the catalyst can improve the hydrophilicity of the catalyst surface, which is beneficial to improving cyclohexene selec- tivity [19,51]. (2) ZnSO 4 in the reaction slurry can promote desorption of cyclohexene through a physical-chemical inter- action [51]. (3) The pH value of the reaction slurry change with the amount of ZnSO 4 Â·7H 2 O, resulting in the existence of dif- ferent forms of B. As a consequence, the activity and the cyclohexene selectivity of the catalyst were affected [51]. Our group [52] investigated the influences of different zinc ion concentration and pH value on the performance of the Ru-Fe-B/ZrO 2 catalyst, and found the optimal concentration of Zn 2+ in the slurry was in range of 0.5â€“0.6 mol/L with the pH value of 5.4â€“5.5. The catalyst exhibited high activity and ex- cellent cyclohexne selectivity, as shown in Table 3. However, detail studies on the interaction between the catalyst and ZnSO 4 have not yet been presented in the open literature. Another important method for enhancing cyclohexene se- lectivity is by the addition of organic additives into the reaction slurry. Fan et al. [53] prepared a Ru-Co-B/È–-Al 2 O 3 catalyst and investigated the effects of organic additives on the performance of this catalyst. The results are shown in Table 4. They found that diethanolamine caused the hydrolysis of ZnSO 4 to gener- ate Zn(OH) 2 by the basicity of its aqueous solution, and the synergistic effect of Zn(OH) 2 and diethanolamine resulted in the enhancement of cyclohexene selectivity. They suggested that the roles of the organic additives on the improvement of cyclohexene selectivity were the following four. (1) Organic amines or alcohols adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst can bond with cyclohexene through hydrogen bonding. This sig- nificantly weakens the overlap of the ÊŒ-electrons of the C=C double bond in cyclohexene with the d orbital of ruthenium and caused the hydrogen-bonded cyclohexene to desorb rapidly, resulting in the increase of cyclohexene selectivity. (2) Some organic additives improve the interaction between Zn species and metallic Ru. (3) Interaction between Ru active sites and the organic additives lead to the formation of a stagnant water layer on the surface of the catalyst, resulting in the increase of the hydrophilicity of the catalyst surface. (4) Electron transfer from N or O in the organic additives to the d orbital of ruthe- nium probably occurred and made ruthenium become elec- tron-rich, resulting in the easy desorption of cyclohexene and the increase of cyclohexene selectivity. Although the addition of inorganic additives, especially ZnSO 4 , can achieve a high cyclohexene yield and had been successfully applied in industrial production, ZnSO 4 is a strongly corrosive medium due to the acidity of its hydrolysis, and thus the hydrogenation has to be performed in Hastelloy alloy units with a good acid resistance. In addition, ZnSO 4 can lead to a rapid deactivation of the catalyst. Therefore, the use of no additives for the benzene selective hydrogenation to cyclohexene is becoming a new topic of research. Fan et al. [36] prepared a Ru-Co-B/È–-Al 2 O 3 catalyst, and obtained a cyclo- hexene yield of 28.8% without any additives in this catalyst. Moreover, the catalyst can be recycled six times without loss in activity and cyclohexene selectivity, indicating the excellent stability of the catalyst. This is shown in Fig. 3. 3.5 Pretreatment The pretreatment often used is a process where the catalyst is kept for 1 h or more in the presence of ZnSO 4 but in the absence of benzene under reaction conditions. The industrial operation requires 22 h [54]. Our group investigated the effects of the pretreatment on the catalytic performance of the Ru-Fe-B/ZrO 2 catalyst and found that the activity decreased and cyclohexene selectivity increased significantly after the pretreatment [50]. È– 40 > 100 and S HE (40) >80% are required in industrial produc- Table 3 Effects of Zn 2+ concentrations on catalytic performance of Ru-Fe-B/ZrO 2 for benzene hydrogenation to cyclohexene [Zn 2+ ]/(mol/L) pH X BZ /% S HE /% Y HE /% 0 7.2 50.9 35.2 17.9 0.10 6.1 25.0 71.9 18.0 0.30 5.8 26.1 76.7 20.0 0.50 5.5 37.6 74.0 27.8 0.60 5.4 39.9 70.6 28.2 0.80 5.2 44.6 62.3 27.8 Reaction conditions: H 2 O 280 ml, benzene 140 ml, Ru-Fe-B/ZrO 2 cata- lyst (0.64 g Ru) 4 g, 140 o C, 5 MPa, stirring rate 1000 r/min, 5 min.

SUN Haijie et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1â€“16 tion in order to reduce the burden of post-treatment, where È– 40 is the activity index and represents the mass of benzene con- verted by 1 g of catalyst per hour at the benzene conversion of 40%, and S HE (40) is the cyclohexene selectivity at the benzene conversion of 40% [50]. The values of È– 40 = 351.6 and S HE (40) = 83.33% obtained over the Ru-Fe-B/ZrO 2 catalyst completely satisfied the industrial demand. We proposed the roles of the pretreatment were the following three. (1) After the pretreat- ment, hydrogen was preferentially adsorbed on the most active sites and benzene can be only adsorbed on the moderately active sites. This benefits the activation of benzene and also the desorption of cyclohexene [50]. (2) The pretreatment resulted in the passivation and structural stability of the catalyst, which prolonged the life of the catalyst [55]. (3) The pretreatment shifted the pore distribution to bigger pores, which promoted the desorption of cyclohexene and improved cyclohexene selectivity [55]. 4 Modifiable character Modifiable character here means the modification of the activity and selectivity by adding an amount of acidic or basic substance in order to compensate for deviations from the normal activity and selectivity caused by factors such as long time run and fluctuation of the reaction conditions to keep the normal operation of the catalyst [30,56]. Our group investi- gated the effects of the dosage and feeding method of ZnO and H 2 SO 4 on the performance of the Ru-Fe-B/ZrO 2 catalyst [35]. The results showed that cyclohexene selectivity increased and activity decreased with increased ZnO dosage. Activity in- creased and cyclohexene selectivity decreased with increased H 2 SO 4 dosage. Different feeding methods of ZnO or H 2 SO 4 exerted definite influence on the performance of the catalyst, but the degrees of influence were different. Moreover, the activity and cyclohexene selectivity of the catalyst can be reversibly modified by adding ZnO or H 2 SO 4 into the slurry. We speculated that ZnO or H 2 SO 4 can reversibly modify the content of Zn chemisorbed on the surface of the catalyst and the distribution, morphology, and electron density of the Ru active sites were changed. The mode of chemisorption was the leading cause fort the difference in the catalytic performances with respect to the two feeding methods of ZnO or H 2 SO 4 . It is also the main reason why the activity and the selectivity during the modifying test were different from that during the blank test. 5 Pilot test of the catalyst 5.1 Batch pilot test In 2002, supported by the Innovation Fund for Technology Based Firms and in cooperation with enterprises, our group completed the scale-up of the preparation of the Ru-Fe-B/ZrO 2 catalyst for a pilot test and successfully tested the catalytic technology in a 50 L batch reactor [52]. The results indicated that both the activity and cyclohexene selectivity of the catalyst increased with the increase of Zn 2+ concentration from 0.5 to 0.6 mol/L. The addition of dispersant ZrO 2 can improve both the activity and cyclohexene selectivity for the concentration of Zn 2+ below 0.5 mol/L. The optimal dosage of ZrO 2 was m(Cat)/m(ZrO 2 ) = 1:2. A larger dosage led to a slight increase in the activity and a large decrease in the cyclohexene selec- tivity. A cyclohexene selectivity of 80% at a benzene conver- sion of 40% was achieved over the catalyst pretreated 12 h under the optimal conditions: reaction temperature of 130â€“135 o C, H 2 pressure of 4.5â€“5.0 MPa, Zn 2+ concentration of 0.5 mol/L, V(H 2 O):V(C 6 H 6 ) = 2:1 and m(Cat)/m(ZrO 2 ) = 1/2, which approached the laboratory level. 5.2 Continuous pilot test In cooperation with an enterprise, our group investigated the activity and cyclohexene selectivity, modifiable character, regeneration, and lifetime of the Ru-La-B/ZrO 2 catalyst in a 100 L stainless steel autoclave shown in Fig. 4 [37,38,55]. Figure 5 shows the activity and cyclohexene selectivity over the Ru-La-B/ZrO 2 catalyst and Ru-Zn catalyst, respectively, at 170 h. The activity of the Ru-La-B/ZrO 2 catalyst was higher by above 10% before 100 h. In the 100â€“170 h period, the activities of both were close. The cyclohexene selectivity gradually increased with time and the cyclohexene selectivity of the Ru-La-B/ZrO 2 catalyst was obviously higher than that of the Ru-Zn catalyst after 40 h. It should be noted that the Ru loading of the former was 0.18 kg, which was 40% that of the latter. In this unit we also carried out the detailed investigation of the regeneration of the Ru-La-B/ZrO 2 catalyst [38,55]. The TEM results indicated that the deactivation of the catalyst was mainly attributable to the agglomeration of the particles and crystallization of the amorphous alloy.

SUN Haijie et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1â€“16 Fe 2+ , dissolved from the inner wall of the unit, in the reaction slurry and on the surface of the catalyst at different reaction times were detected. The results suggested that the cumulative adsorption of Zn 2+ and especially Fe 2+ also led to the deactiva- tion of the catalyst, and thus a washing method was proposed. Table 5 showed the activity and cyclohexene selectivity of the catalyst before and after regeneration with different washing methods. The acid-washing methods can recover the activity and cyclohexene selectivity of the catalyst. Washing with 2.0 mol/L HCl can remove more Fe 2+ and all Zn 2+ from the analysis of the contents of Zn 2+ and Fe 2+ in the wash water and gave the best catalyst from the regeneration. Figure 6 shows the activity and cyclohexene selectivity after the addition of the regenerated catalyst (a) and during the 340â€“360 h period. As can be seen from Fig. 6(a), the activity after the regeneration rose 30.6% and was maintained above 24.0% for 14 h. Cyclohexene selectivity first decreased and increased gradually with reaction time. The activity of the catalyst can be stabilized at above 20% and cyclohexene se- lectivity maintained above 55% for 466 h by the regeneration and modification as shown in Fig. 6(b). That is, a completely catalytic system using the amorphous alloy catalyst for ben- zene selective hydrogenation to cyclohexene has been estab- lished by the pilot test. 6 Conclusions and prospects A Ru-M-B/ZrO 2 catalyst is better than the present industrial Ru-Zn catalyst because of its higher activity and excellent cyclohexene selectivity, higher utilization of Ru and simpler 8 9 SL WCR TIC TIC WC CCL SL WCR WC CCL WPH SM WPHR CCH LIC LDIC SC146 GFV HDR SC 1 2 3 5 6 0 7 4 Fig. 4.

This Ru-Fe-B/ZrO 2 catalyst is the most attractive of the catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexene. However, results from a continuous pilot plant are less than satisfactory and showed some differ- ences with those from a batch pilot plant. The investigation of the differences between the continuous technology and batch technology and the improvement of the catalyst and technology conditions to give better performance and the industrial ap- plication of the amorphous alloy catalyst are the main present tasks. The use of the amorphous alloy catalyst without any additive only gave a low cyclohexene yield of 28.8% and low cyclohexene selectivity, so this technology is another important research project to develop a high stability of the catalyst to go with the low demand on the reactor and its simple operation.
