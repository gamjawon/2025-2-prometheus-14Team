Nanostructured CeO2 with morphologies of nanorod, nano-cube, and nano-octahedron were successfully synthesized and the effects of cerium morphology were investigated on the catalytic efficiency of Pd/CeO2 for CO combustion. The light-off curves showed that Pd supported on rod-like CeO2 (1 0 0) plane had excellent performance. Subsequently, different contents of Pd were loaded on nanorod CeO2 to investigate the effect of Pd and CeO2 support interaction on the catalytic activity. Under optimal deployment, CO can be completely converted below 50℃. Through cautious analysis of SEM, HAADF-STEM, XRD, XPS, and EDS patterns, Pd was proved to be highly dispersed on the surface of CeO2 carrier (1 0 0) in the form of PdO and PdxCe1-xO2-σ. As a result of the strong metal-support interaction, Pd2+ ions substituted for Ce4+, -Pd2+-O2−-Ce4+- species were formed for enhancing CO oxidation. Simultaneously, the generation of Ce3+/Ce4+ ion pairs can be regulated by adjusting the proportion of Pd. Further in situ DRIFTS characterization revealed that in this reaction system, highly dispersed Pd on the surface of Pd/R-CeO2 could increase the concentration of Ce3+ on the surface, and lattice oxygen was activated in the oxidation reaction to generate abundant oxygen vacancies, which can promote the generation of active centers synergistically, thereby greatly enhancing the reaction activity. Graphical abstract Image, graphical abstract Keywords Pd dispersion CeO2 morphology Metal-support interaction CO oxidation 1 Introduction CO, a crucial C1 resource, can be converted into hydrocarbons in the presence of H2O or H2, which was a committed process in the transformation of non-petroleum-based carbon materials into liquid fuels [1,2]. Nevertheless, there would be an inevitable problem of CO leakage during industrial production. Together with the density of cities increases and the number of cars grows, CO emissions in the atmosphere continued to augment [3]. The high level of CO in the atmosphere was a serious health and environmental problem [4,5]. Moreover, in the production of clean energy, the trace CO in the hydrogen-rich system would contaminate the electrode of the fuel cell and greatly reduce the performance of the battery [6,7]. Therefore, it was necessary to take a measure to effectively reduce the content of CO in the atmosphere. Up to now, kinds of methods for CO removal have been explored in plentiful studies, among them physical adsorption and chemical conversion including CO adsorption, alkylation, catalytic reduction, and preferential oxidation have been reported [8,9]. Nevertheless, conventional treatments resulted in extremely low concentrations of CO remaining in the atmosphere. To solve this problem, catalytic oxidation had attracted extensive attention due to its advantages of low temperature, supernal efficiency, less cost, and without free emissions, which had become a focus and hot topic of current research [10,11]. For a long time, supported noble metal materials had been considered as active components in low temperature CO oxidation [12–14]. Among them, Pd-based catalysts were commonly known to offer unique preponderance. The chemical state and coordination environment of Pd, as well as the interaction between Pd and the support, were generally believed to have momentous effects on the catalytic behavior. Li and co-works prepared modified Pd-Cu/HAP by modifying hydroxyapatite support with Na and found that the introduction of Na can raise the number of Pd+ active sites on the surface, to boost the catalytic activity [15]. Zhou et al. developed three kinds of Pd/CeO2 catalysts with different chemical states. It was proved that the CO catalytic oxidation activity was correlated with the valence and chemical environment of Pd species, and found that Pdδ+ (2 < δ ≤ 4) had excellent performance [16]. However, some opinions suggested that metallic Pd had a more superior effect on CO adsorption and O2 activation [17]. Besides, to improve the thermal stability, the core-shell SiO2@Pd@CeO2 catalyst prepared by adjusting the catalyst structure and metal-support interaction significantly inhibited the sintering of Pd particles, and increased the lifetime of the catalyst [18]. The commonly used carriers for Pd-based catalysts included CeO2, CuO, SiO2, TiO2, etc. [19–21]. CeO2 was an important rare earth element with favorable oxygen storage capacity and convertible Ce4+ and Ce3+ metal ion pairs [22–24]. Cerium-based materials had raised much concern due to their special surface dependence and were extensively used in catalytic reactions such as CO oxidation, CH4 reforming, and water decomposition [25–27]. Popularly, it had been known that the oxygen vacancy was highly related to the plane of CeO2. In general preparation, CeO2 preferentially exposed (1 1 1) surface as a stable status. However, as a polar surface, CeO2 (1 0 0) had higher catalytic activity [28]. There was a strong interaction between CeO2 and metal components, which could promote the generation of active centers [29–33]. Meanwhile, lattice oxygen could be activated in the oxidation reaction and accelerated the oxygen exchange and transport on account of the abundant oxygen vacancy inside. Pd-CeO2 catalyst system had been widely studied for CO oxidation because of its high active component (PdOx and PdxCe1-xO2-σ) and strong interaction. Due to the interaction between Ce4+ and Pd2+, highly dispersed Pd2+-O2-—Ce4+ species were formed, resulting in more uncoordinated oxygen atoms and surface oxygen vacancies, thus improving the catalytic activity [34]. Since Pd was too expensive to be applied on a large scale, efforts had been made to achieve the efficient utilization of Pd. An effective method was to optimize the size of Pd particles, so as to improve the dispersity of Pd [35,36]. However, dispersed Pd atoms or clusters were easy to aggregate and grow into large nanoparticles on account of their high surface energy. An economical and handy process to improve the dispersity of Pd was therefore required. In this study, palladium acetate was dissolved in toluene as the precursor solution, and with the aid of the special three-coordinate structure of palladium acetate in toluene solution, Pd was loaded on the rod-shaped, cubic, and octahedral CeO2 for CO catalytic oxidation. The structure and surface morphology of the catalyst were characterized by TEM, EDS, XRD, BET, and XPS. Meanwhile, the intermediate of carbon monoxide transformation was detected by DRIFTS to analyze the in-situ adsorption behavior of CO on the catalyst surface, so as to explore the reaction mechanism of carbon monoxide on Pd/CeO2. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalysts preparation CeO2 supports with distinct morphologies, including octahedral ceria, cubic ceria and rod ceria, were prepared by a typical hydrothermal method [37]. For the synthesis of ceria octahedrons, at room temperature, this study adopted the following method: 3.474 g of Ce(NO3)3•6H2O and 0.0341 g of Na3PO4•12H2O were dissolved in 70 mL of ultrapure water, and stirred fully with a magnetic stirrer for one hour. The compounded solution was then moved and securely sealed to a 100 ml stainless steel hydrothermal reactor with a container of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). After drying at 160 °C for 24 h, the obtained product was the precursor of octahedral ceria. The precursors were isolated by centrifugation after being cooled to room temperature and washed several times with ultrapure water and ethanol, then dried for 24 h at 80 °C and calcinated in air for 5 h at 600 °C with a heating rate of 3 °C/min. The final product was denoted as OCeO2. By a similar process, cubic ceria and rod ceria were prepared. 1.389 g Ce(NO3)3•6H2O and 15.36 g NaOH were dissolved respectively in 10 ml and 60 ml of ultrapure water. Under intense stirring, the above solutions were slowly commixed and continuously stirred at room temperature for 30 min to obtain a milky white suspension. The compounded solution was then moved and securely sealed to a 100 ml stainless steel hydrothermal reactor with a container of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), dried for 24 h at 100 °C or 180 °C. (rod-shaped for 100 °C, and cube-shaped for 180 °C). After hydrothermal treatment, the hydrothermal kettle was cooled to ambient temperature with ice water. The precursor solution obtained was washed with deionized water and ethanol for several times, and finally dried overnight at 80 °C for 24 h followed by calcinated at 600 °C for 5 h with a heating rate of 3 °C/min to obtain rod and cubic ceria, which was denoted as R-CeO2 and CCeO2, (R-CeO2 for rod ceria and CCeO2 for cubic ceria). As a comparison, ceria supports with unfixed morphologies were prepared by precipitation method, denoted as P-CeO2. 2.2. Pd/CeO2 catalysts preparation Pd was immersed on the surface of CeO2 by initial wet impregnation method. A certain amount of Pd(OAc)2 was placed in 5 mL of toluene solution, and ultrasonically dispersed for 30 min at room temperature to make the Pd(OAc)2 fully and uniformly dispersed. Then the prepared CeO2 supports with different morphologies were added into the above homogeneous solution. After impregnated for 30 min, it was dried in an oven at 120 °C for 4 h to remove toluene solution. Subsequently, the catalyst precursor was put into a tubular furnace and heated to 600 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min under air atmosphere for 4 h. Pd/CeO2 catalysts with different loading ratios were obtained, which were denoted as x% Pd/CeO2 catalysts, where x was the palladium loading (wt%). For ease of comparison, ordinary supported samples, labeled x N% Pd/CeO2, were prepared in the same procedure by substituting Pd(NO3)2•2H2O for Pd(OAc)2 and solvent for deionized water. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Effect of CeO2 morphology and Pd loading on CO catalytic oxidation activity The catalytic efficiency of various specimens in CO combustion was expressed in Fig. 1 and Fig. S1. The catalytic oxidation behavior of the CeO2 supports was seen to have followed the sequence: R-CeO2 > CCeO2 > OCeO2, which was on account of the ceria nanorods having higher surface area, smaller crystallite size, more oxygen vacancies, and mobility of oxygen compared to nano-cube and nano-octahedron [38]. Taking 0.2 wt% Pd/CeO2 as an example, the catalytic conversion activities of CO on different morphologies of Pd/CeO2 were compared, as shown in Fig. 1a. At the same time, the reaction temperature of each sample was studied when the CO conversion reached 10% (T10), 50% (T50), and 90% (T90), as well as TOF, were shown in Table S1. With a low loading of 0.2% Pd, CO was activated at room temperature and fully converted at 109 °C on 0.2% Pd/R-CeO2, while for comparison, the temperatures of fully converted CO on 0.2% Pd/P-CeO2, 0.2% Pd/CCeO2, and 0.2% Pd/OCeO2 were 150 °C, 170 °C and 180 °C, respectively. TOF of 0.2% Pd/R-CeO2 (1.15 × 10−2) was much higher than that of 0.2% Pd/CCeO2 (3.12 × 10−3) and 0.2% Pd/OCeO2 (2.53×10−3) at 50 °C. It was obvious that the conversion efficiency of CO oxidation depended on the interaction of Pd and different morphologies of CeO2. Considering the excellent catalytic performance of Pd/R-CeO2 under low content, subsequent experiments were carried out with different loading of Pd/R-CeO2 to investigate the effect of the interaction of Pd and CeO2 on CO catalytic oxidation. The catalytic performance of Pd/R-CeO2 samples with diverse Pd contents in CO oxidation was shown in Fig. 1b. For R-CeO2, the complete conversion temperature of CO was more than 300 °C, while for parallel, the complete conversion of CO could be achieved at 109 °C when only 0.2% Pd was loaded. It indicated that the catalytic activity of CO was significantly improved when Pd was loaded in a small amount. With the increase of Pd loading, the activity was enhanced in turn and reached the optimum at 4% Pd/R-CeO2. However, when the loading of Pd was increased in the range of 4%−6%, the complete conversion temperature of CO was raised from 50 °C to 130 °C. It might be related to the distribution of Pd on the CeO2 surface. In order to facilitate comprehension, we tested the activity of 4% Pd/CeO2 synthesized by the ordinary impregnated method. At 50 °C, CO had been completely converted on 4% Pd/R-CeO2, while no activation had yet started for CO on 4N% Pd/R-CeO2, and the temperature of CO complete conversion was as high as 210 °C for 4N% Pd/R-CeO2. Obviously, the activity of the sample prepared by the ordinary impregnation method (4N% Pd/R-CeO2) was significantly inferior than that of the catalyst prepared by the impregnation method used in this experiment. 3.2 BET surface area, morphology, and crystalline phase N2 adsorption-desorption curves and BJH pore size distribution curves had summarized the BET specific surface area and pore volume of the samples, as listed in Fig. S2 and Table 1 . The specific surface area and pore volume of R-CeO2 were 70.58 m2/g and 0.54 m3/g, respectively. With the introduction of palladium, the specific surface area decreased significantly, while it was raised slightly when the loading of palladium was increased to 4%. For 4% Pd/R-CeO2, lumping specific surface area was conducive to CO catalytic reaction. The XRD patterns of Pd/R-CeO2 catalysts were shown in Fig. 2 . All samples had obvious diffraction peaks at 2θ = 28.6°, 33.1°, 47.5°, 56.3°, 59.1°, 69.4°, 76.7°, and 79.1°, corresponding to (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), (3 1 1), (2 2 2), (4 0 0), (3 3 1), and (4 2 0) planes of CeO2, respectively (JCPDS 34–0394). The diffraction peaks of CeO2 did not change distinctly after adding different contents of palladium species, indicating that the deposition of palladium had no effect on the crystal structure of CeO2. A clear diffraction peak of palladium oxide appeared when the loading amount of Pd reached 5%. However, when the content of Pd was 0–4%, no feature peaks corresponding to Pd were observed on the XRD pattern, confirming that Pd nanoparticles should be highly dispersed on the surface of CeO2 species with a smaller size. The morphology of the as-prepared catalysts was surveyed by SEM, TEM, and HAADF-STEM. As illustrated in Fig. S2 and Fig. 3 , CeO2 with rod, cubic and octahedral morphologies were successfully prepared by hydrothermal method, no specific morphology was observed for the CeO2 produced by the precipitation method. The Pd/R-CeO2 nanoparticles exhibited diameters ranging from 11 to 14 nm and lengths distributed between 165 and 240 nm with lattice spacing of 0.28 nm, which selectively exposed the CeO2 (1 0 0) planes; the Pd/CCeO2 nanoparticles exhibited edge lengths ranging from 12 to 58 nm and the Pd/OCeO2 nanoparticles exhibited edge lengths ranging from 50 to 80 nm. Fig. 3 showed the HRTEM and HAADF-STEM images of 4% Pd/R-CeO2. The presence of Pd nanoparticles was not observed in TEM, while the EDS patterns showed that it was uniformly distributed on the CeO2 surface, which was consistent with the XRD results. What was interesting was that a subsize PdO cluster with a diameter of 2.5 nm appeared in HAADF-STEM, further confirmed that Pd nanoparticles with a size less than 2.5 nm were uniformly scattered on CeO2 surface. The ICP-AES experimental findings have been shown in Table 2 to precisely explain the Pd concentration in Pd/CeO2 samples. 3.3 Chemical and electronic states The interaction between CeO2 and Pd was analyzed to investigate the impact of catalyst structure and elemental composition on catalytic properties. In Fig. 4 , XPS characterization of Ce 3d, Pd 3d, and O 1 s for various Pd/CeO2 catalysts were carried out. The fitting curves of CeO2 were shown in Fig. 4a [39,40]. It can be clearly found that the XPS energy spectra of Ce elements in all catalyst samples can be divided into 10 groups. The five major 3d5/2 characteristics were represented as components a0 (881.4 eV), a1(882.1 eV), a2 (884.1 eV), a3 (888.7 eV), and a4 (897.3 eV), and another five characteristic peaks were assigned to b0 (898.2 eV), b1 (900.5 eV), b2 (902.2 eV), b3 (907.3 eV), and b4 (916.3 eV) corresponded to Ce 3d3/2 features, respectively. The consistence of Ce3+ on CeO2 surface was widely recognized as representing the amount of oxygen vacancies. The area of Ce3+ and Ce4+was represented by A and B respectively after fitting integration, then the percentage content of Ce3+ and Ce4+ was expressed by A/(A + B) and B/(A + B), respectively, as shown in Table 1. The Ce3+ content of the surface can be determined by using this relation: Ce3+= A/(A + B), Ce4+= B/(A + B) Where A = a0+a2+b0+b2, and B = a1+a3+a4+b1+b3+b4. To facilitate the comparison of the effect of the addition of palladium on the cerium oxide support, the concentration-related Ce3+ content on CeO2 surface was first measured. The results revealed that the Ce species all occurred in the form of Ce3+ ions and Ce4+ ions in various catalysts. The content of Ce3+ on the R-CeO2 surface was just 19.3% before Pd was loaded, while it increased significantly when palladium was introduced. As the loading of palladium was augmented, the concentration of Ce3+ continued to increase and reached a maximum at 4% Pd/R-CeO2 (33.0%). Afterward, the concentration of Ce3+ began to decrease when the concentration of palladium was more than 4%. As a comparison, the Ce3+in 4N% Pd/R-CeO2 was only 26%. It suggested that the interaction between CeO2 and Pd was capable of adjusting the valence status of elements on the CeO2 surface. Combined with catalytic activity, the level of Ce3+ was positively correlated with the efficiency of CO catalytic oxidation. One of the significant factors that influenced the catalytic behavior of Pd-based catalysts was the chemical condition of Pd on the catalyst surface. To further examine the impact of the interaction between CeO2 and Pd on the chemical environment of surface Pd, the XPS binding energy and fitting results of Pd for Pd/R-CeO2 catalysts with different Pd contents were shown in Fig. 4b, each sample showed a similar curve. Based on pervious literature, two distinct 3d5/2 diffraction peaks of Pd appeared at 336.8 eV and 337.7 eV, corresponding to Pd2+ for crystalline PdOx clusters situated on the CeO2 surface and in ceria matrix of PdxCe1-xO2-σ solid solution at the surface and subsurface, respectively. Meanwhile, the characteristic peaks at 336–343 eV were assigned to Pd 3d3/2 diffraction [41,42]. According to the fitting results (Table 1), Pd2+ dominated on the CeO2 surface among various samples and existed mainly in the form of -Pd2+-O2−-Ce4+-(in PdxCe1-xO2-σ) and Ce-Pd-O (in PdOx clusters). For the 4% Pd/R-CeO2, it had the highest Pd2+ proportion in ceria matrix (61.56%), whereas the ratio of Pd2+ in ceria matrix was only 42.15% in 4N% Pd/R-CeO2, indicating that for 4% Pd/R-CeO2 the Pd species were mainly scattered in the ceria matrix as the solid-solution phase with linkages of (Pd2+-O2−-Ce4+) [34]. The obvious diffraction peaks of Pd in Pd/R-CeO2 proved the existence of well-dispersed Pd ions, and the chemical condition of Pd depended on the interaction between Pd and CeO2. According to the metal support interaction, when the size of the supported metal nanoparticles was small enough, the rise of the empty d atomic orbital and the confined electronic states of the low-coordination metal atom led to obviously regulate the catalytic performance of metal species [43]. The XPS pattern of O 1 s of three Pd-containing samples were demonstrated in Fig. 4c, in which there were two conditions of the oxygen. According to existing literature [39,44,45], the presence of lattice oxygen (labeled as Olatt, e.g., O2−) was corresponded to the binding energy of O 1 s at 529.1 eV, while that at 531.1 eV corresponded to the adsorbed oxygen (labeled as Oads, e.g., O2 2−, O2 − or O−) on the surface of the sample. In the catalytic oxidation of CO, compared with lattice oxygen, surface adsorbed oxygen was generally considered to be the reactive active species. Therefore, the scale of surface adsorbed oxygen to lattice oxygen content (Oads/Olatt) was usually used to represent the catalytic activity of the catalyst in CO catalytic oxidation. Similar to the calculation methods of Ce3+ and Ce4+, Oads/Olatt were calculated by area method, and the related results were shown in Table 1. According to the quantitative analysis, the order of Oads/Olatt results was as follows: 4% Pd/R-CeO2 > 5% Pd/R-CeO2 > 1% Pd/ R-CeO2 > 4 N% Pd/R-CeO2. Among 4% Pd/R-CeO2, Oads/Olatt reached the maximum, which was consistent with Ce3+/(Ce3++ Ce4+). By adjusting the chemical state of Pd, the lattice oxygen was activated due to the metal support interaction, which released a large number of oxygen vacancies and accelerated the exchange and transportation of oxygen, thus the reaction activity was improved. 3.4 Redox property The Pd/R-CeO2 catalysts with different loadings were studied by H2-TPR, so as to explore the reduction properties of the samples, and the consequence were shown in Fig. 5 . There were two distinct reduction peaks in TPR curves of CeO2 support, among which the reduction peak at 452 °C was due to the reduction of adsorbed oxygen on the CeO2 surface, while at 805 °C corresponded to the reduction of lattice oxygen species in CeO2 support. After Pd loading, three redox peaks appeared in all curves within 100 °C −900 °C. The high temperature region (811 °C −836 °C) was associated with the reduction of lattice oxygen in CeO2 crystal, and the broad peak in the lower temperature region (300 °C −600 °C) was assigned to the reduction of oxygen on CeO2 surface far from Pd [35]. However, the peak located at low temperature can lead to the reduction of oxidized Pd species, and the reduction of palladium oxide in Pd/CeO2 with different loadings was occurred at 225 °C. The reduction temperature of palladium oxide in Pd/CeO2 was known to be greater than that of pure PdO, which was principally due to the interaction between PdO and CeO2, and the additional H2 consumption was owing to the spillover of hydrogen from Pd material onto the support resulting in the reduction of CeO2 surface oxygen around it [34]. According to the fitting curve integral, the hydrogen consumption of different catalysts was calculated. For the reduction of PdO, the order of hydrogen consumption was as follows: 4% Pd/R-CeO2 (34.61 mmol/g) > 5% Pd/R-CeO2 (30.26 mmol/g) > 2% Pd/R-CeO2 (15.16 mmol/g), which was consistent with the order of total hydrogen consumption of catalysts, among them 4% Pd/R-CeO2 had the highest reducibility, which was consistent with the catalytic activity. This eventuates was related to the high oxygen mobility caused by the interaction between the active sites of the catalyst and the support. Combined with the above analysis, the highly dispersed Pd loaded on the CeO2 (1 0 0) surface could significantly promote the surface reduction of the carrier, leading to effective CO oxidation activity. 3.5 In suit FTIRS and possible mechanism To further explore the changes in the various compositions of CO reaction substrates, intermediates, and products under reaction conditions, so as to better understand the reaction process, 0.5wt% Pd/CeO2 was characterized and analyzed by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (in suit - DRIFTS). The effect of temperature was analyzed at 50 °C, 70 °C, 90 °C, 100 °C, and 120 °C under a continuous flow of reaction gas (compositions of 1% CO, air balanced), and the signal was shown in Fig. 6 . The spectrum of the catalyst was subtracted when dealing with the background. The range of 1000–1300 cm−1 and 1300–1600 cm−1 can be attributed to the tensile vibration pattern of the CO bond. To be precise, three strong oscillating bands at 1575 cm−1 (CO stretching), 1293 cm−1 (asymmetric OCO stretching), and 1026 cm−1 (symmetric OCO stretching) were considered to be bidentate carbonate. The medium bands at 1469 (CO stretching), 1399 cm−1 (asymmetric OCO stretching), and 1077 cm−1 (symmetric OCO stretching) were divided to be unidentate carbonate [46,47]. In addition, the band at 3653 cm−1 was corresponded to OH stretching vibration of various hydroxyl groups on the oxide support surface [48]. When Pd/R-CeO2 was in contact with CO at 50 °C, there were two obvious infrared absorption peaks at 2173 cm−1 and 2133 cm−1. The former CO was adsorbed on Pd2+ and the latter CO was adsorbed on Pdn+ (0 < n < 2). Similar peaks at 2088 cm−1 and 1970 cm−1 in the figure were observed in most literature [36,46,49,50], attributable to the linear adsorption and bridged adsorption of CO on metal Pd0, respectively. The generation of Pd0 indicated that Pdn+ was partially reduced in the presence of CO. In these spectra, the characteristic bands of CO2 produced by CO adsorption reaction were corresponded to 2330 cm−1 and 2376 cm−1 [36,51]. At 50 ℃, strong characteristic absorption peaks of CO2 appeared, which indicated that CO was excited to generate CO2 at low temperature. As reaction temperature elevated, the intensity of the diffraction peak of CO2 enhanced progressively. According to previous studies, the first step of CO oxidation was the adsorption and separation of oxygen on metal catalysts, followed by the reaction between Oads and CO [52]. In the absence of a catalyst, 119.11 kcal mol−1 of energy was required for the activation of the OO bond, which was reduced significantly in the presence of a catalyst [53]. At lower temperatures, the existence of CO lead to the vigorous growth of strong bands at 1575, 1293, and 1026 cm−1. At the same time, three broad bands belonging to carbonate rocks appeared at 1469, 1293 cm−1, and 1077 cm−1. The strength of carbonate decreased with increasing temperature, which mainly resulted from the instability of the intermediate product on the surface due to desorption or decomposition. On the analysis, we believed that the generation of carbonate was a rate control step. With the gradual promotion of temperature, the intensity of the characteristic peak of CO continues to decrease, only a small amount of CO adsorption can be detected at 90 ℃, while when the temperature raised to 100 ℃, neither CO adsorbed on Pd2+ or Pd+ nor CO adsorbed on Pd°0 could be detected, which was consistent with the results of catalyst activity test. On the discussion of DRIFTs, for highly dispersed small particles of palladium (<2 nm) on the CeO2 (1 0 0) surface, we speculated that the catalytic behavior followed a Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) redox mechanism. In this pattern, through the strong metal-support interaction, Pd2+ entered the CeO2 crystal lattice, so that PdO species and PdxCe1-xO2-σ solid solution mainly existed on the surface of the catalyst. The highly dispersible Pd species and the PdxCe1-xO2-σ support that constantly provided active O* greatly facilitated the activation of CO molecules while increased the oxidation rate of the intermediates, thus the catalytic performance of the Pd/R-CeO2 catalyst were improved, as evidenced by the corresponding XPS binding energy spectra of Pd and Ce. The details in Fig. 7 were as follows: First, CO molecule first adsorbed on the site of coordination unsaturated Pd cation, producing adsorbed CO. While lattice oxygen in PdxCe1-xO2-σ was activated through redox, generating abundant reactive oxygen species O* (mainly O2 2−, O2 −, O−) (step 1). At the same time, the presence of Ce4+/Ce3+ redox electron pairs in Pd/R-CeO2 was beneficial to fabricate structural defects and promote the diffusion of O*, so that there was sufficient O* component on the surface of catalyst (step 2) [16]. Subsequently, adsorbed CO and surface activity O* combined on the surface of PdO, along with CO was cleaved to produce intermediate OCOO− species coordinated with Pd species (step 3). Finally, on account of instability at the coordinated unsaturated Pd-O site, CO2 molecule was desorbed from the metal atom catalyst and the reaction was completed (step 4). Combined with the CO activity test, the highest activity of 4% Pd/CeO2 may be due to the rich adsorbed oxygen and Ce3+ on the surface. 3.6 Investigation of the catalytic stability In practical applications, the continuous stability of the catalyst was crucial. However, owing to the higher surface free energy, the palladium-based catalyst was prone to sintering during the consecutive catalysis with a decrease in the amount of active sites and thus deactivation. In this experiment, we investigated the stability of the 4% Pd/R-CeO2 catalyst at 40 °C and 60 °C, as shown in Fig. 8 . In the 60 h running experiment, the catalyst can still completely eliminate CO at 60 °C, and the conversion of the CO did not decrease discernibly at 40 °C. This indicated that subsize palladium species exhibited high stability on the surface or crystal lattice of the cerium oxide support, and this metal-support interaction can well anchor the active sites and reduce inactivation. 4 Conclusion Overall, Pd/CeO2 Catalysts with different morphologies for efficient CO catalytic oxidation were successfully prepared, and Pd supported on the plane of R-CeO2 (1 0 0) exhibited much higher catalytic activity. It was found that highly dispersed Pd species were generated at CeO2 (1 0 0) even when the Pd content reached 4%, and vast Pd2+ replaced Ce4+ to form -Pd2+-O2−-Ce4+- through the interaction of metal and support, leading to a rise in the ratio of Ce3+ / Ce4+ ion pairs on the catalyst surface. Meanwhile, Olatt was activated and plentiful oxygen vacancies on the surface of the support were generated, which was favoring to the adsorption of oxygen on the surface of the catalyst to produce Oads. The increased oxygen environment accelerated the activation of CO molecules and the oxidation of intermediate products, thereby enhancing the conversion efficiency. We hope that this study provides some reference for exploring the interfacial role of metal-support to improve the efficiency of CO catalytic oxidation.

        "dc:description": "Nanostructured CeO2 with morphologies of nanorod, nano-cube, and nano-octahedron were successfully synthesized and the effects of cerium morphology were investigated on the catalytic efficiency of Pd/CeO2 for CO combustion. The light-off curves showed that Pd supported on rod-like CeO2 (1 0 0) plane had excellent performance. Subsequently, different contents of Pd were loaded on nanorod CeO2 to investigate the effect of Pd and CeO2 support interaction on the catalytic activity. Under optimal deployment, CO can be completely converted below 50℃. Through cautious analysis of SEM, HAADF-STEM, XRD, XPS, and EDS patterns, Pd was proved to be highly dispersed on the surface of CeO2 carrier (1 0 0) in the form of PdO and PdxCe1-xO2-σ. As a result of the strong metal-support interaction, Pd2+ ions substituted for Ce4+, -Pd2+-O2−-Ce4+- species were formed for enhancing CO oxidation. Simultaneously, the generation of Ce3+/Ce4+ ion pairs can be regulated by adjusting the proportion of Pd. Further in situ DRIFTS characterization revealed that in this reaction system, highly dispersed Pd on the surface of Pd/R-CeO2 could increase the concentration of Ce3+ on the surface, and lattice oxygen was activated in the oxidation reaction to generate abundant oxygen vacancies, which can promote the generation of active centers synergistically, thereby greatly enhancing the reaction activity.",
