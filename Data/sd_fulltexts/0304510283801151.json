P. J. VERLAAN, J. P. C. BOOTSMA, C. E. KONING and G. CHALLA Laboratory of Polymer Chemistry, State University of Groningen, Nijenborgh 16, 9747 AG Groningen (The Netherlands) (Received June 23, 1982) Summary Immobilized macromolecular copper catalysts were prepared by radical graft copolymerization of styrene and 4-vinylpyridine on nonporous silica spheres and by subsequent complexation with copper(II) chloride. The activities of the catalysts were measured in the oxidative coupling of 2,6-di-t- butylphenol (DTBP) with oxygen. Variations of shaking speed and oxygen pressure showed that no oxygen diffusion limitation occurs. Neither the molar mass of unbound macromolecular analogs nor the size of the silica spheres influenced the catalytic activity. The intrinsic activity was not affected by immobilization as was shown by the equal redox rate constants (k-i) for bound and unbound catalysts. An increasing degree of loading, 6, of the silica spheres with macromolecular ligands led to higher values of the substrate complexation constant K\\, approaching the value of unbound macromolecular catalysts. Application of the anchored catalysts in a stirred flow reactor appeared to be possible. Introduction The utilization of polymers as carriers for many kinds of species (pharmaca, enzymes, reagents, catalysts, etc.) is a subject of increasing interest [1-3]. The application of tailor-made modified polymers in catalysis very often leads to encouraging results [4 - 6]. Since we are particu- larly interested in effects concerning the macromolecule itself, a system was chosen in which the polymer chain is a part of the transition metal-contain- ing catalyst [7, 8]. Since crosslinked, network-like supports very often lead to diffusion limitation problems, anchoring of separate linear macromolecules onto nonporous supports seems preferable. It has been known for over two decades that copper complexes of amines catalyze the oxidative coupling of phenols [9]. By comparing soluble with immobilized linear macromolecu- lar amines as ligands for the copper salts, the special effects of anchoring these macromolecules can easily be studied [10]. 0304-5102/83/0000-0000/$03.00 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 160 In order to obtain an immobilized macromolecular amine, we co- polymerized styrene and 4-vinylpyridine from a radical initiator chemically bound to nonporous silica spheres. Non-immobilized macromolecular ligands were prepared by copolymerization of styrene and 4-vinylpyridine using AIBN as an initiator. It has already been shown that immobilization of these macromolecular catalysts on nonporous silica spheres does not affect the mechanistic behaviour of the catalytically active sites [10]. The oxidative coupling of 2,6-di-t-butylphenol (DTBP), (I), with oxygen in the presence of the copper catalysts (III) (L = pyridine group in copo- lymer (IV)) yields exclusively diphenoquinone (II)* and water, and was chosen as a simple model reaction: 2 O^OH (DTBP) (I) catalyst ^ (DPQ) (11) 2 H,0 2* Cu Cu (III) -(CHz- CH)- co-(-CH2- CH)- 0.75 A, 0.25 (IV) The oxidative coupling reaction can be described by the Michaelis- Menten scheme: E+S ki ES > E + P in which E stands for copper catalyst, S for phenol and P for dipheno- quinone. From this scheme the steady state kinetics of the reaction can be derived yielding the equation: R fe^tEJo ^[E]o[S]o or, [E]o[S]o R=k, K^ + [S]o (i) (ii) *II = 4 - (3,5-di-t-butyl-4-oxo-2,5-cyclohexadiene-l-ylidene)- 2,6-di-t-butyl-2,5-cyclo- diene-1-one. hexadiene-1-one 161 where -R is the initial rate in mol Oz dm\"3 s~1, [E] o and [S] o are the initial concentrations of copper salt and phenol, respectively, k^ is the rate-deter- mining rate constant in s~' and Km = (k- i + k-^/ki is the Michaelis constant m mol dm\"3. Since [E]o is known, k^ and Km can be derived from [phenol] - dependent measurements of R as shown by eqn. (i). The influence of the molar mass of the macromolecular ligand (IV) can now easily be studied. Other interesting features are the possible influences of the degree of load- ing, 6, and the size of the silica spheres on the catalytic activities. Finally, the continuous re-use of the immobilized catalyst can be tested by applying a type of stirred flow reactor. Experimental Synthesis of the unbound copolymers (IV ) The copolymers of 4-vinylpyridine and styrene were synthesized by radical copolymerization using AIBN as an initiator in toluene according to Fuoss and Gathers [11]. The mole fraction of 4-vinylpyridine units in the copolymers was kept around 0.25 and was determined by elemental analysis. The number-average molar mass, M^, was determined in toluene with a Knauer membrane osmometer. Grafting of poly(styrene-co-4-uinylpyridine) on silica. (Si0^)^_g poly[(CH-i- CHC^H,)^-co-(CH^CHC,H^N)^}e The radical initiator was anchored to silica (Aerosil 200V with average particle diameter 12 nm, or 0X50 with average particle diameter 40 nm; Degussa) according to Fery et al. [12]. Graft copolymerization was carried out according to a previously described method [10]. The weight fraction of polymer, 6, was determined by elemental analysis and loss on ignition. Oxidative coupling Batch-type reactor The standard reaction conditions for oxidative coupling were: T= 298.16 K; [Cu2'1\"] = 3.32 mmol dm-3; [phenol] = 0.06 mol dm\"3; [pyridine]: [Cu^] = 2; [OH-HCu2-'] = 1; Po,= 101.3 kPa. Solvent mixture 1,2- dichlorobenzene:methanol = 13:2 (v/v). Total reaction volume 0.015 dm3. Hydroxide was added as methanolic potassium hydroxide. The initial reaction rates, R, were determined by measuring the rates of oxygen con- sumption with an automatic isobaric gas burette. Stirred flow reactor The anchored copper catalyst (0.1 mmol Cu2\"1\") was composed in the reaction vessel (0.05 dm3). Oxygen and a solution of 2,6-di-t-butylphenol were injected continuously into the vessel at a constant flow rate. The solution with reaction products left the reaction vessel through a glass tube (length 0.5 m, width 5 mm) mounted vertically on top of the vessel. Since 162 the flow rate was kept rather low, the catalyst could settle from this tube into the reaction vessel, thus preventing leaching out of the anchored catalyst. The conversion was determined by measuring the diphenoquinone concentration spectrophotometrically at 418 nm (e=64600 dm3 moF' cm\"\"1 in the 13/2 solvent mixture 1,2-dichlorobenzene/methanol) at fixed time intervals. Reaction conditions: PQ = 130 kPa; T= 298 K; [phenol] = 0.1 mol dm\"3; flow rate of phenol solution = 0.02 dm3 h~1. Results and discussion Kinetics First we verified that the observed oxidative coupling reaction rates of DTBP were not oxygen diffusion controlled. The effect of shaking speed of the reaction vessel is shown in Fig. 1, whereas oxygen pressure-dependent measurements are shown in Fig. 2. Variation of shaking speed created a large variation in liquid-oxygen interface area. From Fig. 1 it can be seen that above shaking speed 3 (^2 Hz) no further increase in oxygen consump- tion rate is observed. Thus under standard reaction conditions the shaking speed of 5 (^6 Hz) is high enough to prevent any effect. Figure 2 shows clearly a zero order in oxygen in the range of 50 to 150 kPa, indicating that oxygen diffusion limitation from gas phase to liquid phase does not occur under normal conditions. In Fig. 3, reaction rates R are shown as a function of copper concentra- tion at fixed pyridine-hydroxo-copper ratio (standard conditions). A straight line at copper concentrations above 0.06 mmol dm~3 points to a first order in copper catalyst. At very low catalyst concentrations a higher order is observed. fM o <. 6 SHAKING SPEED Fig. 1.

Substrate-dependent measurements show a first order at low phenol concentrations, turning into a zero order region at higher phenol concentra- tions and pointing to a Michaelis-Menten type of reaction scheme. In Fig. 4 double reciprocal plots of reaction rate versus substrate concentration are shown for different catalysts. From these so-called Lineweaver-Burk plots, k^ and Km can be calculated as shown by eqn. (i). 164 Fig. 4.

Standard reaction conditions, varying [phenol]. All macromolecular catalysts, unbound as well as anchored, have a common y-axis intersection, indicating that the k^ values are identical and equal to 0.02 s~1. In general no increase in intrinsic activity of macromolec- ular catalytic sites is expected after immobilization, therefore we may assume that no change in the total number of active sites occurs after im- mobilization of the macromolecular catalysts. Strong adsorption of the polymer on silica causing inhibition of active sites is not observed. Even adding an excess of unmodified silica to a system with unbound macro- molecular catalysts did not influence its catalytic activity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a decrease of overall reaction rates R is observed after immobilization of the macromolecular catalysts. This can be entirely attributed to an increasing value of Km (eqn. ii). A decreasing degree of loading, 6, of the silica spheres with macromolecular ligands also yields increasing K^ values. Since ft 2 remains constant for all catalysts, changes in the reciprocal value of K,n reflect changes in the equilibrium constant K^ = k i/fe-i [13]. In Fig. 5, k-i and K^1 values are shown as a function of 9. The values for three unbound macromolecular catalysts with Af,, = 40 000, 240 000 and 400000 are also determined. These catalysts gave k^ values of 0.021, 0.019 and 0.020 s~1 and K,n~i values of 2.03, 1.90 and 1.90 dm3 mor1, respective- 165 o 0.2 Q.i Fig. 5.

Average values for unbound macromolecular cat- alysts: ki = 0.020 s~1 and K^~1 = 1.94 dm3 mor1 (see text). ly. Obviously the influence of molar mass is negligible and therefore diffu- sion limitation within the unbound polymer coils does not occur [14]. A higher degree of loading, 6, yields higher observed reaction rates R due to lower K^ values, as can be derived from Fig. 5 and eqn. (ii). This means that in the steady state situation more ES complex is present with increasing 0. Since all catalytic sites appeared to be active, an increase of [ES] with 6 is probably caused by local effects on substrate complexation. A Lineweaver-Burk plot in the presence of additional water [H^O] = 0.07 mol dm\"3 with unbound macromolecular catalyst (Afn = 40 000) resulted in the same k^ values of 0.021 s~1 and in a decrease of Km~\\ from 2.03 (without water) to 1.26 dm3 mor1 (in the presence of additional water) (see Fig. 4; (o)). Consequently, addition of water does not affect the intrin- sic activity of the catalytic sites but decreases the substrate complexation constant K^. Silica spheres are strongly hydrophilic, which might lead to water enrichment in the environment of these spheres. The anchored catalyt- ic sites which are bound onto these hydrophilic spheres, are forced to be in the environment of a relatively higher water concentration. This leads to the decrease in Kn,\"1 values after immobilization. A higher degree of loading 0, at constant catalyst concentration, results in a reduction of silica sphere concentration. Consequently, more catalytic sites share one silica sphere and the relative influence of water will diminish at higher values of 0, leading to an enhancement of K^~\\ values (Fig. 5; ). At still higher 0 values, the polymer coils anchored on one silica sphere will start to overlap. Only up to that point can a fair comparison be made between unbound coils and anchored coils. The number of polymer chains attached to the silica spheres could be calculated. Depending on 0 and Mn, 166 one to three polymer chains were anchored to one silica sphere in the case of Aerosil 200V. The radius of gyration of the unbound polymer coils was estimated [14] and appeared to be of the same order of magnitude as the radius of the silica spheres (5 - 10 nm for Aerosil 200V). Thus comparison with unbound coils is allowed, since we are still far from closest-packing of coils around a sphere. Thus it is clearly demonstrated that fixation of one end of a flexible linear polymer chain to a small spherical particle will not introduce changes on catalytic sites anchored along these mobile chains. This is in contrast to stiff, network-like supports, which normally show a five- to tenfold decrease in activity [15]. Stirred flow reactor Water is a product of oxidative coupling reactions. It must be kept homogeneously dissolved, since otherwise the water phase will destroy the catalytically active complexes. Therefore, high total turnover numbers are not expected in a single run in a batch type of reactor. The main purpose of immobilization is to increase catalyst lifetime and to simplify separation of catalyst and products. Our previous results showed [10] that multiple use of the anchored polymeric catalyst could easily be realized by decanting the reaction mixture from a batch type reactor with a 100% maintenance of catalytic activity even after twelve complete runs. Since the catalytic activity in those discontinuous experiments could be totally preserved, experiments in a stirred flow reactor seemed worthwhile to start. In Fig. 6 typical examples of the production of diphenoquinone versus time are shown. In the case of Aerosil 200V as carrier with 9 == 0.43 a higher conversion is observed compared to Aerosil 0X50 with 9 = 0.11. This is in agreement with the results discussed in the preceding section (higher K,n~\\ for higher 9). After 10 h the decrease in activity seems to reach a constant value for both types of catalysts. This decrease in activity is Fig. 6. Diphenoquinone production in mol dm\"3 as a function of time in a stirred flow reactor; ( ) Aerosil 200V with 9 = 0.43; (a) Aerosil 0X50 with 0 = 0.11; conditions, see Experimental. 167 probably due to loss of catalyst as could be observed visually in the product stream. So, the increase in the dimensions of silica particles on using 0X50 did not diminish this loss. The rate of settling of the catalysts seems to be determined by aggrega- tion processes rather than by the dimensions of the primary particles. Aggregation might be controlled by the size of the spheres and the thickness of the polymer layer around the spheres. These phenomena deserve further attention in order to improve catalyst/product separation. Nevertheless higher total turnover numbers can be obtained in these stirred flow reactor than in batch-type experiments. Conclusions The anchorage of soluble macromolecular metal complexes to an inert support leads to the following results: the intrinsic activity of catalytic sites is unaffected by anchorage, as was shown by the invariability of k^, fixation of the end group of linear macromolecular catalysts to nonporous silica spheres does not lead to diffusion limitation problems; variation of the molar mass of the macromolecular ligands does not affect the reaction rates; immobilization leads to lower reaction rates due to less complete substrate complexation, especially at lower degrees of loading; utilization of these anchored macromolecular catalysts in a stirred flow reactor seems possible although incomplete settling of catalyst was a problem.
