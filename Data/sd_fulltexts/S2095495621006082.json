Graphical abstract An integrated approach which combines the redox–mediated polysulfide electrocatalysis and a gel sulfur cathode is proposed to mitigate, concurrently, the issues of polysulfide shuttle, electrode passivation and electrolyte consumption. While the sulfur conversion reaction kinetics in Li–S batteries is nowadays improved by the use of appropriate electrocatalysts, it remains a challenge for the batteries to perform well under the lean electrolyte condition where polysulfide shuttle, electrode passivation and the loss of electrolyte due to side reactions, are aggravated. These challenges are addressed in this study by the tandem use of a polysulfide conversion catalyst and a redox–targeting mediator in a gel sulfur cathode. Specifically, the gel cathode reduces the polysulfide mobility and hence the polysulfide shuttle and the passivation of the lithium anode by the crossover polysulfides. The redox mediator restrains the deposition of inactive sulfur species in the cathode thereby enabling the Fe–N and Co–N co–doped carbon catalyst to prolong its catalytic activity. Consequently, the integrated catalytic system is able to increase the discharge capacity of high–loading (6.8 mg cm−2) lean–electrolyte (4.0 µL mg−1) Li–S batteries from ∼630 to ∼1316 mAh g−1, concurrently with an improvement of the cycle life (600 cycles with 46% capacity retention at 1.0 mA cm−2). Redox mediator assisted catalysis in a gel cathode is therefore an effective strategy to extend the application of the sulfur conversion catalyst in lean electrolyte Li–S batteries. Keywords Redox mediators Gel electrolytes Polysulfide catalysis Lean electrolyte Lithium–sulfur batteries 1 Introduction Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are considered as one of the more promising successors to lithium–ion batteries because of their high theoretical energy density (∼2500 Wh kg−1) and low cost of sulfur (<$150 ton−1) [1–3]. However, the actual energy density of Li–S batteries developed to date (<400 Wh kg−1) is notably lower than the theoretical value [4–7]. The use of a large amount of electrolyte in the batteries has been identified as a major contributing factor [8–10]. For example, a Li–S battery with an electrolyte–to–sulfur (E/S) ratio of ∼25 µL mg−1 has a theoretical energy density of only ∼150 Wh kg−1 which can be increased to ∼400 Wh kg−1 if the E/S ratio is reduced to 4 µL mg−1 [11–13]. However, a low E/S ratio decreases the ion conduction in the sulfur cathode and impedes the kinetics of the sulfur electrochemical reaction [14–16]. Consequently, the lean–electrolyte Li–S batteries as implemented to date have a rather low specific capacity (<1200 mAh g−1) and a low cycling stability (<500 cycles) [17–22]. The specific capacity and cyclability of Li–S batteries can be improved by accelerating the sulfur conversion kinetics with suitable electrocatalysts [23–26]. The effectiveness of electrocatalysis, however, diminishes under the lean electrolyte condition. This is because of the high polysulfide concentration in a starved electrolyte, which increases the electrolyte viscosity and the charge and mass transfer resistance of the sulfur cathode [27–29]. When the E/S ratio is lowered to the solubility limit of polysulfides (∼8 molS L−1 for ether–based solvents, equivalent to an E/S ratio of ∼3.9 μL mg−1) [11], solid sulfur and Li2S would accumulate in the sulfur cathode during battery cycling [30,31]. The accumulated S/Li2S are less utilizable because of the difficulty of reactions in the solid state, resulting in the passivation of the sulfur cathode [32–34]. The Li2S deposits accumulated to micrometer size, in particular, is nearly electrochemically inert as dead Li2S and requires a very high activation potential (∼3.6 V vs. Li+/Li) to initiate its oxidation [35–37]. In addition, the back–and–forth diffusion of polysulfides between the two battery electrodes is mainly concentration–driven [38–41]. The high polysulfide concentration gradient under the lean electrolyte condition causes more polysulfides to diffuse to the lithium anode and react there in unwanted side reactions (Fig. 1 a) [42,43]. The continuance of these side reactions during battery cycling is a significant burden on the lean–electrolyte Li–S batteries as electrolyte is also consumed in the process and the batteries would eventually fail due to electrolyte starvation [44–46]. Therefore, the capacity and cyclability of Li–S batteries operating under the lean electrolyte condition can only be improved if the polysulfide shuttle, electrode passivation and electrolyte consumption can be controlled concomitantly. The integrated approach presented in this study can mitigate these operating issues of lean–electrolyte Li–S batteries quite effectively. It involves the tandem use of an effective polysulfide conversion catalyst and a redox–matched mediator in a gel sulfur cathode, which is coupled to a protected Li electrode (Fig. 1b). The gel sulfur cathode suppresses the polysulfide shuttle and the polysulfide passivation of the lithium anode, and the I3 −/I− mediator therein is used to oxidize the accumulated dead Li2S to minimize the passivation of the sulfur cathode after repeated cycling. The electrolyte consumption by the side reactions on the Li anode is minimized by a Li+ conductive Li3PS4 coating on the protected Li electrode [47,48]. These measures, when implemented for a previously developed Fe–N and Co–N co–doped carbon catalyst (Fe–N/Co–N@C) [49], could increase the discharge capacity of high–loading (6.8 mg cm−2) lean–electrolyte (4.0 µL mg−1) Li–S batteries from ∼630 to ∼1316 mAh g−1, concurrently with an improvement of the cycle life (600 cycles with 46% capacity retention at 1.0 mA cm−2). The experimental results establish the effectiveness of the integrated approach over the more common methods based on catalyst optimization only. 2 Experimental 2.1 Chemicals and materials Sulfur (99.5 wt%, S), lithium sulfide (99.98%, Li2S), lithium foil (99.9 wt%, Li), bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (99.95 wt%, LiTFSI), lithium iodide (99.9%, LiI), potassium ferricyanide (K3Fe(CN)6, 99 wt%), potassium hexacyanocobaltate (K3Co(CN)6, 97 wt%), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 99.9 wt%), 1,3–dioxolane (DOL, anhydrous, 99.8 wt%), 1,2–dimethoxyethane (DME, anhydrous, 99.5 wt%), tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (>99.9 wt%, G4), lithium nitrate (99.99 wt%, LiNO3), acetonitrile (ACN, anhydrous, 99.8 wt%), poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO, average Mw ∼4000000), poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP, average Mw ∼360000), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, 99.5 wt%), 1–methyl–2–pyrrolidinone (99.5 wt%, NMP) from Sigma Aldrich; carbon nanotube (CNT) from Carbon Solutions, Inc.; and Super P carbon (SP, 99.5 wt%) from Timcal; were all used as received. Tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether was dried Mover 4 Ångström molecular sieves for 5 days before use. 2.2 Preparation of Fe–N/Co–N@C catalyst The Fe–N/Co–N@C catalyst was prepared by pyrolyzing a mixture of K3Fe(CN)6 and K3Co(CN)6 at elevated temperature in argon. K3Fe(CN)6 and K3Co(CN)6 with the same molar ratio were firstly mixed by ball–milling at 300 rpm for 12 h. Then, the collected powders were heated from room temperature to 1000 °C in flowing Ar (40 mL min−1) at 5 °C min−1 and kept at 1000 °C for 2 h. After cooling to room temperature, the obtained solid was washed with deionized water followed by etching in 50 mL 2 M H2SO4 solution at 80 °C for 12 h under magnetic stirring. The final solid products were separated by centrifugation, repeatedly washed with water thrice; and finally lyophilized. 2.3 Fabrication of sulfur cathodes The sulfur working electrode was prepared as follows: 70 wt% sulfur powder, 10 wt% Fe–N/Co–N@C powder, 5 wt% Super P and 5 wt% CNT were first thoroughly mixed by ball–milling at 300 rpm for 12 h. The obtained powders were then added to a viscous slurry containing 10 wt% binder and different amount of LiI for another 12 h. PEO and PVP with a mass ratio of 4:1 were used as the binder for the preparation of gel sulfur (denoted as Gel–S) cathodes, and PVDF binder was used for normal sulfur (denoted as Nor–S) cathodes. Their compositions are shown in Table 1 . The obtained slurry was cast on an Al foil, and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. The C–S electrodes were prepared by blending 70 wt% sulfur powder, 10% PVDF binder, 10 wt% Super P and 10 wt% CNT. To prepare the sulfur electrode with a catalytic interlayer, the sulfur electrode was coated with a slurry of 90 wt% Fe–N/Co–N@C and 10 wt% PVDF binder in NMP, and was finalized after drying at 60 °C for 12 h. Fig. S1 shows a typical coated sulfur electrode with a coating thickness of ∼0.3 µm, and the coated mass loading is ∼0.2 mg cm−2. The foils were punched into 12 mm diameter disks and the typical sulfur loading on each disk was ∼6.8 mg cm−2. 2.4 Electrochemical measurements of lithium–sulfur cells CR2025–type coin cells were assembled by pairing the sulfur cathode with a Li3PS4–protected lithium metal anode in an Ar–filled glovebox. The cathode and anode were separated by a Celgard 2400 separator. The electrolyte was 1.0 M LiTFSI in a 1:1 (v/v) DOL/DME mixture with 0.2 M LiNO3, and the electrolyte to sulfur ratio in the cell was kept at 4 μL mg−1. Galvanostatic charging and discharging were carried at room temperature on a NEWARE BTS–5 V battery tester at various C rates (1C = 1675 mAh g−1). Cyclic voltammetry, potentiostatic measurements and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded using an Autolab type III electrochemical workstation. EIS measurements were carried from 1 MHz to 10 mHz. All tests were conducted at room temperature. 3 Results and discussion The gel sulfur cathode was prepared by replacing the conventional PVDF) binder for the sulfur cathode with a PEO–PVP binder (Fig. 2 a). Different from the PVDF binder, the PEO–PVP binder has good gelation properties in liquid electrolyte because of an abundance of oxygen functional groups which bind well with the solvent molecules [50–52]. The inset of Fig. 2b shows an example of the good gelation ability of the PEO–PVP binder when added with a small amount of electrolyte at a normalized E/S ratio of 4.0 µL mg−1 (18 mg PEO–PVP binder in 0.5 mL electrolyte, assuming a sulfur/binder mass ratio of 7:1 in a fabricated sulfur cathode). In addition, PEO also forms Li+ conductive complexes with Li salts and PVP has a good affinity for polysulfides [50,53]. Together they can contribute to improving the Li+ conduction and polysulfide retention in the gel sulfur cathode. Fig. 2(b) shows the evaporation of electrolytes in the presence of the PVDF or PEO–PVP binder respectively. The electrolyte in the PVDF binder evaporated quickly at ∼62.5 °C while the loss of electrolyte with the PEO–PVP binder was significantly lower (<7 wt%) even at 100 °C, indicating good solvent molecule encapsulation with the PEO–PVP binder. We first measured the impedance of Li–S cells with either a Gel–S cathode or a Nor–S cathode at the same E/S ratio of 4.0 µL mg−1. Fig. 2(c) shows the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of Li–S cells with either the Gel–S cathode or the Nor–S cathode. The charge transfer resistance of the Gel–S cell (R ct) deduced from the diameter of the semicircular arc at medium frequency is notably smaller than that of the Nor–S cell, suggesting a more facile charge transfer in the Gel–S cell sulfur cathode. In addition, the Warburg resistance (σ) measured from the low frequency region of the Gel–S cathode is also smaller than that of the Nor–S cathode (Fig. S2), suggesting the lower mass transfer resistance of the Gel–S cathode. The reason could be the strong affinity of the PEO–PVP binder for electrolyte which allows a more uniform wetting of the sulfur cathode under the lean electrolyte condition [53,54]. Wetting test also reveals a smaller contact angle for the Gel–S cathode with the PEO–PVP binder than the Nor–S cathode with the PVDF binder (Fig. S3). The accessibility of active sulfur and its contact with the Li+ ions in the electrolyte are improved as a result. The passivation of the sulfur cathode by the accumulation of insulating Li2S after long cycling is another challenge of Li–S cells operating under the lean electrolyte condition. LiI has previously been used as a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film–forming agent in Li–S batteries [7]. It was used in this study for a different function – to bring down sulfur cathode passivation by oxidizing dead Li2S through the I3 −/I− redox couple; an idea based on its successful application in Li–O2 batteries as a redox mediator to facilitate Li2O oxidation [55]. It is necessary to note that the active Li2S can be electrochemically oxidized at the sulfur electrode between 1.8–2.8 V, and only the inactive Li2S particles accumulated at the sulfur electrode (dead Li2S) are chemically oxidized by the I3 −/I− redox for reutilization between 2.8–3.2 V (a voltage range where I3 − species generate via I− + e− → I3 −). The spontaneous chemical reactions between I3 − and commercial Li2S could be illustrated via a simple visual test. As shown in the inset of Fig. S4, the commercial Li2S particles were instantaneously oxidized to polysulfides via I3 − + Li2S → I− + Li2S n (n ≥ 4) within a few seconds, suggesting that the reaction between I3 − and Li2S was facile [56]. In addition, LiI could also decrease the charge transfer resistance of the gel sulfur cathode. Fig. 2(d) shows that the charge transfer resistance decreases first with the increase in the LiI content, and then increases after a certain content threshold is exceeded. A LiI–to–sulfur mass ratio of 0.5 appears to be near optimal. The aggregation and crystallization of LiI in the Gel–S cathode after the content threshold could possibly be the reason for the increase in the charge transfer resistance. The catalytic activities of the Fe–N/Co–N@C catalyst in Gel–S and Nor–S cathodes were analyzed first by cyclic voltammetry (CV) at the E/S ratio of 4.0 µL mg−1. The sharp redox peaks and low polarization (as shown by the positive shifts in the cathodic peaks and negative shifts in the anodic peaks) of the sulfur electrochemical reaction in the Gel–S cathode suggest more facile polysulfide conversions kinetics in the Gel–S cathode (Fig. 3 a). In stark contrast to this is the sulfur cathode without the Fe–N/Co–N@C catalyst (the C–S electrode, see Experimental section) where only a broad cathodic peak at ∼2.22 V (related to the S8 → Li2S4 reaction) was found. The absence of the second cathodic peak indicates the large polarization in the Li2S4 → Li2S reaction (and the need for a high reduction overpotential) without the bimetallic Fe–N/Co–N@C catalyst. Hence the battery performance under the lean electrolyte condition was improved significantly with the use of an effective catalyst, based on the Tafel plot analysis in Fig. S5. The effectiveness of the Fe–N/Co–N@C catalyst in accelerating the polysulfide reaction kinetics especially the short–chain polysulfide conversion reactions has been discussed in our previous work [49]. The Gel–S and Nor–S cathodes with LiI (denoted as the Gel–S–LiI and Nor–S–LiI cathodes respectively) were similarly evaluated. Fig. 3(b) shows that the Gel–S–LiI cathode has the sharpest redox peaks and the lowest polarization, suggesting further polysulfide reaction kinetics improvements in the presence of LiI. This was also demonstrated by the EIS measurement of a smaller charge transfer resistance for the Gel–S–LiI cathode (Fig. 2d). Relative to the Nor–S–LiI cathode, all cathodic peaks of the Gel–S–LiI cathode are positively shifted and all anodic peaks are negatively shifted negatively. Hence the catalysis with Fe–N/Co–N@C under the lean electrolyte condition is more effective in the Gel–S–LiI cathode than that in the Nor–S–LiI cathode. Furthermore, we studied the cycling performance of Gel–S–LiI and Nor–S–LiI cathodes in Li–S full cells at the same lean electrolyte condition of E/S ratio of 4.0 µL mg−1. The Gel–S–LiI and Nor–S–LiI cathodes were coated with a Fe–N/Co–N@C catalytic layer to enhance their cycling stability (see Experimental section for details). The comparison of the charge–discharge curves of Gel–S–LiI and Nor–S–LiI full cells shows that the former can deliver more discharge capacity amidst lower polarization (Fig. 4 a). Even without the addition of LiI, the Gel–S cathode still showed a higher discharge capacity and greater cycling stability than that of the Nor–S cathode (Fig. 4b and c). This is indication of the better control of the polysulfide shuttle in the Gel–S cathode. The addition of LiI in the Gel–S cathode further increased its cycling performance as shown in Fig. 4(c and d). The reasons was due not only to the improved polysulfide reaction kinetics with LiI in the sulfur cathode, but also the reutilization of the accumulated dead Li2S by the I−/I3 − redox couple between 2.8–3.2 V. The discharge capacity of the Gel–S–LiI cell at ∼1316 mAh gS −1 represents one of the highest discharge capacities reported to date for Li–S batteries operating under the lean electrolyte condition (Table S1). There was the usual capacity decrease initially, but a discharge capacity of ∼947 mAh gS −1 was still available after 100 cycles at 0.5 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4d); and ∼425 mAh gS −1 after 600 cycles at 1.0 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4e). Even at elevated current densities of 1.5 and 2.0 mA cm−2, the cell could still provide capacities as high as ∼825 and ∼590 mAh g−1 respectively (Fig. S6). By comparison the Nor–S–LiI cell without a gel cathode showed a generally lower discharge capacity and poorer cycling stability. In addition, the near 100% Coulombic efficiency of the Gel–S–LiI cell suggests that the gel sulfur cathode is able to exercise good control of the polysulfide shuttle. The gradual battery capacity decrease could result from the progressive dissolution of polysulfides in the gel electrolyte; and the accumulation of inactive sulfur in the cathode which could not be reutilized by the I3 −/I− redox. More work is still needed to continually improve the cycling stability of high–loading lean–electrolyte Li–S batteries. We also investigated the likely reasons for the improved performance by analyzing the electrochemical characteristics of the Gel–S–LiI cells after 50 cycles together with a postmortem analysis of the cycled sulfur cathode and lithium anode. Fig. 5 (a) shows the presence of an additional peak at ∼2.8 V in the cyclic voltammogram of the cell after 50 cycles. The galvanostatic charge–discharge curves of the cell also reveal a capacity contribution of ∼140 mAh gS −1 at the ∼2.75 V plateau after 50 cycles (Fig. 5b). The new peak at ∼2.75 V and its associated capacity could be attributed to the activation of solid Li2S by the I3 −/I− redox couple. This was confirmed by a gel cathode with micrometer size Li2S and LiI mediator which showed the same activation potential (Fig. S7). Fig. 5(c and d) shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of sulfur cathodes at 2.8 V recovered from the Gel–S–LiI and Gel–S cells after 50 discharge/charge cycles. The morphology of the Gel–S–LiI cathode retained most of the initial porous structure of the cathode, whereas a thick solid Li2S deposit was found in the case of the Gel–S cathode without LiI. The presence of a Li2S deposit could arise from the accumulation and growth of Li2S at the cathode/electrolyte interface to the micrometer range, which requires a higher potential to initiate the oxidation [57]. The deposition of Li2S on the cathode surface also resulted in an additional semicircle in the high-frequency region of the EIS spectrum (Fig. S8). The Gel–S–LiI cell, on the other hand, showed a very low resistance, suggesting that most of the Li2S in the cathode had been oxidized by the I3 −/I− redox couple. For a more direct evidence, the sulfur cathodes after cycling were also examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Peaks at 160.2 (2p 1/2) and 161.3 eV (2p 3/2) B.E, which were detected only on the Gel–S cathode, can be attributed to the Li2S deposit in the sulfur cathode. There was negligible Li2S presence on the Gel–S–LiI cathode (Fig. 5e). This is confirmation of the oxidative removal of the Li2S in the sulfur cathode by the I3 −/I− redox couple, which reduces the passivation of the sulfur cathode. Aside from the effectiveness of the Gel–S–LiI cathode in restraining the polysulfide shuttle and cathode passivation, it is also effective in curtailing potential side reactions between mobile I3 −/I− mediator and the Li anode which also consume the electrolyte solvent. Fig. 5(f) shows that strong I 3d peaks assignable to LiI were found on the Li anode of the Nor–S–LiI cell, whereas very weak I 3d signals were detected on the Li anode of the Gel–S–LiI cell. This indicates that the Gel–S–LiI cathode could effectively impede the diffusion of I3 −/I− to the Li anode, and hence the side reactions with the lithium anode. The side reactions on Li anode could be further curtailed with a Li3PS4–protected Li anode. The XPS spectrum of the Li anode of the Gel–S–LiI cell was devoid of the I 3d signal (Fig. 5f); and the Li3PS4 protection layer still retained its pristine chemical structure (Fig. S9) [49]. With the suppression of the anode side reactions, the protected Li anode of the Gel–S–LiI cell after 100 cycles still displayed a smooth surface without any growth of dendritic and mossy lithium (Fig. S10), whereas the Li anode of the Nor–S–LiI cell showed a potholed structure as a result of severe side reactions. Fig. S11 shows the cycling stability comparison of Gel–S–LiI cells with and without the Li3PS4 protected layer on the Li anode. The measurements showed that the Gel–S–LiI cell with the Li3PS4 covered Li anode could cycle significantly better, confirming the effectiveness of the Li3PS4 layer in alleviating the polysulfide shuttle and the corrosion of the Li anode. Even without the addition of LiNO3 additive in the electrolyte, the Gel–S–LiI cell still sustained good cycling stability without sharp capacity fading (Fig. S12). 4 Conclusions In summary, this study presents an integrated approach which uses a gel electrolyte with dissolved LiI to mitigate, concurrently, the issues of polysulfide shuttle, electrode passivation and electrolyte consumption in lean–electrolyte Li–S batteries. Under the same E/S ratio of 4.0 µL mg−1, EIS measurements indicated that a Gel–S–LiI cathode could provide higher ion conduction and lower charge transfer resistance than a Nor–S–LiI cathode. CV analysis also corroborated a more facile polysulfide reaction kinetics. As a result, sulfur cathodes with a Fe–N and Co–N co–doped carbon catalyst could deliver high discharge capacity (∼1316 mAh gS −1 at 0.5 mA cm−2) and good cycling stability (46% capacity retention after 600 cycles at 1.0 mA cm−2) under a high sulfur loading (6.8 mg cm−2) and lean–electrolyte (4.0 µL mg−1) condition. This integrated approach of combining the redox–mediated electrocatalysis of polysulfide conversion and Gel–S cathode in one Li–S battery to improve battery cycling performance in lean electrolyte Li–S batteries is a simple but effective approach worthy of further exploration.

        "dc:description": "While the sulfur conversion reaction kinetics in Li–S batteries is nowadays improved by the use of appropriate electrocatalysts, it remains a challenge for the batteries to perform well under the lean electrolyte condition where polysulfide shuttle, electrode passivation and the loss of electrolyte due to side reactions, are aggravated. These challenges are addressed in this study by the tandem use of a polysulfide conversion catalyst and a redox–targeting mediator in a gel sulfur cathode. Specifically, the gel cathode reduces the polysulfide mobility and hence the polysulfide shuttle and the passivation of the lithium anode by the crossover polysulfides. The redox mediator restrains the deposition of inactive sulfur species in the cathode thereby enabling the Fe–N and Co–N co–doped carbon catalyst to prolong its catalytic activity. Consequently, the integrated catalytic system is able to increase the discharge capacity of high–loading (6.8 mg cm−2) lean–electrolyte (4.0 µL mg−1) Li–S batteries from ∼630 to ∼1316 mAh g−1, concurrently with an improvement of the cycle life (600 cycles with 46% capacity retention at 1.0 mA cm−2). Redox mediator assisted catalysis in a gel cathode is therefore an effective strategy to extend the application of the sulfur conversion catalyst in lean electrolyte Li–S batteries.",
