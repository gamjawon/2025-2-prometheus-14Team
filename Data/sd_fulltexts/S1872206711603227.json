DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(10)60204-5 The Effect of La 2 O 3 on Pd Close-Coupled Catalysts YAO Yanling, FANG Ruimei, SHI Zhonghua*, GONG Maochu, CHEN Yaoqiang Key Laboratory of Green Chemistry and Technology, Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, Sichuan, China Abstract: Palladium close-coupled catalysts were prepared by impregnation method with different amounts of La 2 O 3 as a promoter. Low temperature N 2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction, H 2 -temperature programmed reduction (H 2 -TPR), CO-chemisorption, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to characterize the effect of La 2 O 3 on the physicochemical properties of the prepared catalysts. Their catalytic activities toward C 3 H 8 conversion were evaluated using a gas mixture that simulates the emissions from a gasoline engine. The results of catalytic activity indicate that the presence of La 2 O 3 significantly improves catalytic performance and enhances the thermal resistance of the catalysts. H 2 -TPR results suggest that the addition of La 2 O 3 increases the reductive ability of the catalysts and shifts the reduction temperature to a lower value. The XPS and CO-chemisorption results indicate that doping by La 2 O 3 also improves the dispersion of the Pd species and decreases the mean particle size of palladium. The optimal loading amount of La 2 O 3 is 10%. Key words: lanthanum oxide; palladium; propane; close-coupled catalyst; thermal stability Exhaust gases that originate from the internal combustion of automobile engines are an important source of atmospheric contamination, particularly in urban areas. These gases mainly contain three toxic substances: hydrocarbons (HCs), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxides (NO x ) [1,2]. With the gradual improvement in environmental standards, controlling the HCs emitted during the cold-start of a vehicle is of particular interest and methods to quickly bring the catalyst up to the operating temperature are being explored. One effec- tive solution is to locate the catalyst close to the exhaust ports of the engine (close-coupled catalyst). However, this leads to the catalyst bed running at high temperature when the engine is operating normally, sometimes at higher than 1100 Â°C. Therefore, the thermal resistance property of the catalyst should also be suitable. Lanthanum oxide, as a cheap and rich rare-earth element oxide has been widely used as a stabilizer, a sub-catalyst or a promoter in automobile exhaust catalysts. The addition of lanthanum oxide to alumina can impede the loss of surface area and raise the transformation temperature of alumina to enable a transformation from the È–-phase to the Ä®-phase [3â€“9]. Sun et al. [10] reported that the addition of a small amount of La 2 O 3 to Pd/CeO 2 significantly improved the catalytic activity toward methanol decomposition and also improved the surface area and dispersion of Pd. Koltsakis et al. [11] also reported that La 3+ ions could increase the dispersion of active components and active sites, which results in a decrease in the light-off temperature of the catalyst and in an improvement of NO x conversion. It has been further reported that the addition of La to the alumina-supported Pd catalysts increases its tolerance to thermal deactivation [12,13]. Therefore, the La species en- hances the thermal stability of È–-Al 2 O 3 , improves its catalytic performance and impedes the sintering of the supported Pd catalysts. Shi et al. [14] investigated the catalytic performance of a Pt-Rh close-coupled catalyst supported on La-stabilized alumina and found high low-temperature catalytic activity. Li et al. [15] studied the effect of different supports on a close-coupled supported palladium catalyst and found that the support did influence the catalytic performance. However, there is still a lack of information about the catalytic func- tioning of lanthanum oxide as a promoter on Pd close-coupled catalysts. In this work we investigated the influence of La 2 O 3 as a promoter on the physicochemical properties and the catalyti- YAO Yanling et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 589â€“594 cactivities of Pd close-coupled catalysts. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation La-stabilized alumina and Ce 0.35 Zr 0.55 Y 0.07 La 0.03 O 1.95 (OSM) were used as catalyst supports. Before use, Al 2 O 3 and OSM were calcined at 1000 and 900 Â°C for 5 h, respectively. After calcination, Al 2 O 3 had a surface area of 145 m 2 /g and a pore volume of 0.45 ml/g while the OSM had a surface area of 53 m 2 /g and a pore volume 0.16 ml/g. A series of La 2 O 3 promoted Pd close-coupled catalysts were prepared by impregnating two different supports (m(OSM)/ m(Al 2 O 3 ) = 1/4) with an aqueous solution of Pd(NO 3 ) 2 , drying at 120 Â°C overnight and calcining at 550 Â°C for 3 h in a muffle furnace. The two obtained catalyst powders were mixed and La(NO 3 ) 3 Â·6H 2 O (La 2 O 3 content was 0, 5%, 10%, and 20%) as well as a specific amount of deionized water was ground to form a homogeneous slurry. The resulting slurry was spread onto honeycomb cordierite (2.5 cm 3 , Corning), and excessive slurry was blown away with compressed air. The catalysts were dried and calcined at 550 Â°C for 3 h in a muffle furnace and the monolithic catalysts were thus obtained. The catalysts were denoted Cat.1, Cat.2, Cat.3, and Cat.4 for the La 2 O 3 contents of 0, 5%, 10%, and 20%, respectively. To compare their thermal stability, the aged catalysts were obtained by calcining the fresh catalysts at 1000 Â°C for 5 h in air. The Pd content in all the catalysts was 2 g/L. 1.2 Catalyst characterization The catalytic activity was evaluated in a multiple fixed bed continuum flow micro-reactor by passing a gas mixture similar to the exhaust gas from a gasoline engine. The gases were regulated with mass flow controllers before entering a blender. The simulated exhaust gas contained a mixture of O 2 , CO (0.6%), C 3 H 8 (0.06%), NO (0.06%), CO 2 (12%), H 2 O (10%), and N 2 (balance). The gas space velocity was 30000 h 1 . The concentration of C 3 H 8 was analyzed online by a five-compo- nent analyzer (FGA-4100, Foshan Analytical Instrument Co., Ltd. China) before and after the simulated gas passed the mi- cro-reactor. The textural properties of the catalysts were determined by the adsorption-desorption of N 2 at the liquid nitrogen tem- perature ( 196 Â°C) on a ZXF-06 automatic surface analyzer (Xibei Chemical Institute, China). To remove the surface im- purities, the samples were degassed under vacuum for 2 h at 350 Â°C before obtaining a measurement. The crystal structures of the catalysts were determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis on a com- puter-controlled DX-2500 diffractometer, using Cu K Ä® radia- tion (Èœ = 0.15418 nm), operating at 40 kV and 25 mA. The XRD data were recorded for 2È™ values between 20Â° and 90Â° with an interval of 0.03Â°. H 2 temperature-programmed reduction (H 2 -TPR) experi- ments were performed on a quartz tubular micro-reactor. The sample (100 mg, 40â€“60 mesh) was pretreated in a flow of N 2 (20 ml/min) from room temperature to 400 Â°C, maintained at this temperature for 45 min and then cooled to room tempera- ture in N 2 (20 ml/min). The reduction was carried out in a flow of a 5% H 2 -95% N 2 (V/V) gas mixture (20 ml/min) from room temperature to 700 Â°C with a heating rate of 8 Â°C/min. The consumption of H 2 was detected by thermal conductivity de- tector (TCD). The metal dispersion and the mean particle size of Pd on the different catalysts were determined by CO-chemisorption over the reduced catalysts. Approximately 300 mg (40â€“60 mesh) of the sample was placed in a U-shaped quartz tube. Before chemisorption, the catalyst was reduced in a flow of H 2 (30 ml/min) at 500 Â°C for 1 h, and then purged with pure N 2 (30 ml/min) at 550 Â°C for 1 h. After being allowed to cool to room temperature, CO was pulsed over the reduced catalyst until the TCD signal from the pulse was constant. The number of ex- posed Pd atoms was calculated assuming a chemisorption stoichiometry of CO/Pd = 1 and all CO was adsorbed on the exposed Pd atoms [16â€“18]. The mean particle size was deter- mined by d = (1.12/D) Ã— 10 Ã­9 m = (1.12/D) nm [19]. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were carried out using a spectrometer (XSAM-800, Kratos Co) with Mg K Ä® radiation under ultra-high voltage (UHV), calibrated internally by a carbon deposit C 1s binding energy at 284.8 eV. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Catalytic activity Figure 1 shows the results of the catalytic performance for C 3 H 8 conversion over fresh and aged catalysts in the simulated exhaust gas. According to Fig. 1, C 3 H 8 conversions over all the fresh and aged catalysts increases with an increase in the temperature and C 3 H 8 can rapidly reach complete conversion. Furthermore, for the fresh catalysts the activities of the La 2 O 3 -containing catalysts were almost higher than that of the La 2 O 3 -free catalyst, which suggests that La 2 O 3 improves the catalytic performance of these catalysts. However, after high temperature calcination the activities of all the catalysts de- creased compared with that of the fresh samples and we thus conclude that all the catalysts undergo different degrees of sintering. This phenomenon was explained in a previous study [20]. Kenevey et al found that during the high-temperature treatment process the surface area of the catalyst is reduced and the original porosity of the material was destroyed while the pore volume also decreased, which results in the degradation of catalytic performance. A summary of changes in the light-off temperature T 50 (T 50 YAO Yanling et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 589â€“594 corresponding to the temperature at which 50% conversion of C 3 H 8 is completed) values for the fresh and aged catalysts are listed in Table 1. In principle, a lower T 50 value results in a higher low-temperature activity of the catalyst. From Table 1, the T 50 values of the fresh Cat.1, Cat.2, Cat.3, and Cat.4 cata- lysts are 285, 273, 270, and 278 Â°C, respectively. The T 50 for C 3 H 8 oxidation increases as follows: Cat.3 < Cat.2 < Cat.4 < Cat.1. After aging at 1000 Â°C for 5 h, the T 50 values increase to a value higher than that of the fresh catalysts, and are 342, 327, 320, and 362 Â°C for Cat.1, Cat.2, Cat.3, and Cat.4, respectively. The order of T 50 values changes to: Cat.3 < Cat.2 < Cat.1 < Cat.4. Only Cat.1 and Cat.4 change positions. This may be the result of excessive La 2 O 3 addition. From Table 1, the differ- ences between the T 50 of the fresh and the aged catalysts (Ç»T) are 57, 54, 50, and 84 Â°C for Cat.1, Cat.2, Cat.3, and Cat.4, respectively. A lower Ç»T indicates better catalyst thermal sta- bility. With an increase in the La 2 O 3 content, the catalytic ac- tivities increase initially, reach the highest value at 10% and then decrease. These results indicate that the introduction of La 2 O 3 into the catalysts as a promoter improves the catalytic activity and the resistance to high temperature aging. The amount of La 2 O 3 loading is very important for C 3 H 8 conversion and an optimum loading amount exists for La 2 O 3 . For the catalysts investigated in this study, Cat.3 exhibits the best low-temperature activity and high-temperature anti-aging performance, so the optimum La 2 O 3 content is 10%. 2.2 Textural properties The BET surface areas and the pore volumes of the fresh and aged catalysts are summarized in Table 2. Significant differ- ences exist between the surface areas and the pore volumes of the fresh catalysts. With an increase in the La 2 O 3 content, the surface areas gradually decrease. The surface area and pore volume of Cat.4 is only 64 m 2 /g and 0.25 ml/g, which is the result of excessive La 2 O 3 addition. Doping with La 2 O 3 dilutes the mass faction of the catalyst support, which gives a larger surface area than that of La 2 O 3 and excessive La 2 O 3 blocks the mesopores of alumina and/or the OSM. This is the main reason for the decrease in the surface area and the pore volume. After calcination at 1000 Â°C for 5 h, the specific surface areas and pore volumes decrease compared with those of the fresh cata- lysts. These results indicate that the catalysts experience a kind of sintering phenomenon. For the aged samples, the La 2 O 3 containing catalysts were found to have larger specific surface areas and pore volumes compared with that of the La 2 O 3 -free catalyst. The surface area over the catalyst without La 2 O 3 doping drops drastically by more than 50% from 112 m 2 /g to 51 m 2 /g. Although the surface areas of the La 2 O 3 doped samples also decrease after high-temperature calcination, as shown in Table 2, their rate of decrease is far slower than that of the catalyst without La 2 O 3 doping. Cat.2, Cat.3, and Cat.4 retain 74%, 90%, and 89% of their surface areas. This indicates a stabilizing effect for La 2 O 3 . Among all the catalysts, Cat.3 has the largest specific surface area and pore volume while Cat.1 has the lowest. According to these results, the addition of La 2 O 3 can help the catalysts retain their large surface areas and pore volumes and to improve their thermal resistance. Alter- natively, we also found that the catalytic activities do not agree with the order of the surface areas.

The diffraction patterns of the various catalysts are shown in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the diffraction peaks of all the fresh samples are similar. The diffraction peaks ap- pear at 2È™ = 29.20Â°, 33.87Â°, 48.76Â°, 57.70Â°, and 79.10Â° and they correspond to a structure similar to Ce 0.50 Zr 0.50 O 2 , and it is specifically Ce 0.35 Zr 0.55 Y 0.07 La 0.03 O 1.95 . The diffraction peaks at 2È™ = 45.76Â°, 60.03Â°, and 67.24Â° are due to È–-Al 2 O 3 . According to the results of peak-broadening analysis (101, 2È™ = 29.20Â°), the crystallite sizes of the Cat.1, Cat.2, Cat.3, and Cat.4 cata- lysts are 8.9, 8.3, 7.8, and 7.1 nm, respectively. Therefore, upon an increase in the La 2 O 3 content the intensity of the diffraction peaks gradually weakens. The crystalline structure of La 2 O 3 is not observed in any of the fresh catalysts, which indicates that La 2 O 3 is well dispersed on the support surface. From Fig. 2(b) the crystalline structures of all fresh catalysts are shown to change at different diffraction angles and the XRD peaks become sharper after calcination at 1000 Â°C for 5 h. Some Ä®-Al 2 O 3 is observed in Cat.1 and Cat.2 (Cat.1 has more Ä®-Al 2 O 3 than Cat.2), and for Cat.3 the catalyst has a highly stable crystalline structure but some LaAlO 3 is detected. However, for Cat.4 with a La 2 O 3 loading of 20%, the crystal- line structure changes obviously. Plenty of LaAlO 3 is present on the catalyst but no Ä®-Al 2 O 3 is detected. This demonstrates the stabilizing effect of La 2 O 3 , which prevents the phase transformation of È–-Al 2 O 3 into Ä®-Al 2 O 3 but excessive La 2 O 3 leads to the formation of LaAlO 3 . LaAlO 3 is a product of the high temperature solid-phase reaction between Al 2 O 3 and La 2 O 3 [5]. From the XRD results of the fresh catalysts, La 2 O 3 is well dispersed on the support surface, which improves the disper- sion of active sites. While excessive La 2 O 3 addition leads to a drastic loss of the specific surface area of the catalyst, the catalytic performance of Cat.4 is lower than that of Cat.2 and Cat.3 and higher than that of Cat.1. For the aged catalysts, the Ä®-phase transformation contributes to the surface area loss (confirmed by the BET results), which results in a decrease in active sites. Therefore, for Cat.1, Cat.2, and Cat.3, the activity increases with a decrease in Ä®-Al 2 O 3 formation, in other words, with an increase in La 2 O 3 content. However, for Cat.4 a large amount of LaAlO 3 forms and Cat.4 has the worst activity, therefore, the formation of LaAlO 3 has a negative effect on catalytic performance even though LaAlO 3 does impede the loss of surface area. Based on the above analysis, it is clear that the loss of surface area and the formation of LaAlO 3 are re- sponsible for the decrease in catalytic activity. No visible PdO or metallic Pd phases are present in the XRD patterns for all the catalysts, indicating that the content of Pd is too low for detection or that the Pd particles are well dispersed on the supports. 2.4 H 2 -TPR analysis H 2 -TPR experiments were carried out to evaluate the rela- tionship between the catalytic activity and the reducibility of the supported catalysts. The redox ability of the catalysts is closely related to the catalytic activity. The H 2 -TPR profiles of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 3. From Fig. 3, although the H 2 -TPR profiles have similar spectra and some variations exist between the samples with different La 2 O 3 content. The sharp peak between 50 and 200 Â°C is due to the reduction of the PdO species. The maximum reduction temperatures of the Cat.1, Cat.2, Cat.3, and Cat.4 catalysts were 139, 132, 115, and 135 Â°C, respectively. This suggests a decrease in the PdO reduction temperature, indi- cating that the Pd-La interaction promotes the reduction of PdO. KaÅ¡par et al. [2] reported that the active phase of Pd three-way catalysts is PdO. The transformation from PdO to Pd deter- mines the catalytic performance of the catalysts.

This confirms that the addition of La 2 O 3 increases the reduction ability of the catalysts and thus results in an improvement in the catalytic activity for C 3 H 8 oxidation. The reducibility order follows the catalytic per- formance results. In addition, the reduction peaks from 250 to 350 Â°C are similar and this can be attributed to the reduction of the surface and/or bulk oxygen of CeO 2 . However, the peak has a low intensity after 900 Â°C calcination on the OSM. 2.5 CO chemisorption analysis The results of the CO-chemisorption of the Pd close-coupled catalysts are listed in Table 3. Pd dispersion and particle size play an important role in the catalytic activity. SimplÃ­cio et al. [21] concluded that higher dispersion and smaller PdO particle sizes for Pd catalysts result in better catalytic activity. After the addition of La 2 O 3 to the catalysts the Pd dispersion increases and the Pd mean particle size decreases, as given in Table 3. These results indicate that La 2 O 3 addition can improve the Pd dispersion and maintain a small Pd particle size. A good cor- relation exists between Pd dispersion and catalytic activity, and a lower dispersion of Pd catalysts is one of the reasons for the poor activity obtained in this study. These results are in good agreement with the conclusions given in Ref. [20]. 2.6 XPS results XPS measurements were carried out to investigate the elec- tronic state of the Pd species to study the effect of La 2 O 3 on the Pd close-coupled catalysts. Table 4 summarizes the binding energy values and the surface atomic ratio of Pd, as calculated from the XPS results of all four catalysts. It has been reported that the binding energies of metallic Pd 0 and PdO are 335.2 and 336.8 eV [22], respectively. As shown in Table 3, the binding energies of the Pd 3d 5/2 electrons of all the catalysts fall between 336.08 and 336.35 eV, which is lower than that of PdO and higher than that of metallic Pd 0 . This indicates that the Pd species in the catalysts are in a par- tially oxidized state Pd Ä¯+ (0 < Ä¯ < 2). This species is more active than Pd metal. Compared with Cat.1, doping with La 2 O 3 results in the Pd 3d peaks shifting to higher values (Table 3). It has been reported that the addition of La could increase the electron density around PdO as an electron donor resulting in a decrease in the binding energy value [23], which is in contrast to our results. In this study, the surface atomic ratios of Pd on the Cat.1, Cat.2, Cat.3, and Cat.4 catalysts are 0.38%, 0.56%, 0.59%, and 0.53%, respectively. By combining the results of H 2 -TPR and CO-chemisorption, we conclude that doping with La 2 O 3 can improve the reduction ability and Pd species dis- persion of the catalysts, leading to better catalytic activity toward propane oxidation. The most plausible explanation for the binding energy shift is that the dispersion of the Pd species increases as a result of La 2 O 3 addition. Considering the cata- lytic activity, the dispersed higher oxidation state of Pd is more active toward the catalytic oxidation of propane. 3 Conclusions XRD characterization results indicate that La 2 O 3 is well dispersed on the supports, however, the formation of LaAlO 3 during high temperature treatment has a negative effect on the catalytic performance and LaAlO 3 impedes the surface area loss of the catalyst. In addition, the presence of La 2 O 3 increases the reduction ability of the catalyst, improves the dispersion of the Pd species, decreases the mean particle size of Pd and stabilizes Pd in a more active high oxidation active. All these factors contribute to the improvement of catalytic activity and the high temperature tolerance of the catalyst.

Tel/Fax: +86-28-85418451 Palladium close-coupled catalysts were prepared by impregnation method with different amounts of La2O3 as a promoter. Low temperature N2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction, H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), CO-chemisorption, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to characterize the effect of La2O3 on the physicochemical properties of the prepared catalysts. Their catalytic activities toward C3H8 conversion were evaluated using a gas mixture that simulates the emissions from a gasoline engine. The results of catalytic activity indicate that the presence of La2O3 significantly improves catalytic performance and enhances the thermal resistance of the catalysts. H2-TPR results suggest that the addition of La2O3 increases the reductive ability of the catalysts and shifts the reduction temperature to a lower value. The XPS and CO-chemisorption results indicate that doping by La2O3 also improves the dispersion of the Pd species and decreases the mean particle size of palladium. The optimal loading amount of La2O3 is 10%. 摘要 ：采用浸渍法制备了不同 La2O3 含量的 Pd 密偶催化剂. 使用低温 N2 吸附-脱附、X 射线衍射、H2 程序升温还原、CO 化学吸附和 X 射线光电子能谱等技术考察了 La2O3 对催化剂性能的影响. 模拟汽车尾气条件考察了催化剂上丙烷的转化活性. 活性测试结果表明, La2O3 的添加能显著提高催化剂对丙烷的转化活性和催化剂的热稳定性.
