Graphical abstract With growing concern about the environment, the oil industry has become interested in new technologies that reduce costs by increasing the efficiency of removing sulfur compounds from fossil fuels. Oxidative desulfurization is an interesting sulfur-removal process for the petroleum industry because it uses mild reaction conditions. In this work, zeolites (ZSM-5, NaX, NaY, Beta and Mordenite) impregnated with 1% vanadium or manganese were used for the oxidation and extraction of dibenzothiophene (DBT) from a diesel load. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption-desorption textural analysis and scanning electron microscopy, and the reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC-FID). It was found that vanadium or manganese impregnation did not significantly modify the structure of the zeolites. The vanadium-impregnated zeolite ZSM-5 showed the best result in the oxidation of dibenzothiophene, oxidizing up to 80% of the DBT added in the diesel charge (ZSM-5 5020 V). The manganese-based catalysts were not as active for this oxidation, and the best performance was found for the removal of DBT by extraction. Keywords Zeolite Vanadium Manganese Oxidative desulfurization 1 Introduction Petroleum (oil) has fundamental importance in our society, and its main use is as a source of energy. Petroleum has a complex composition and is composed of hydrocarbons and other organic compounds that contain heteroatoms of oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur in their structure. During combustion, these heteroatoms give rise to hazardous atmospheric pollutants, such as sulfur oxides (SOx), and incomplete combustion generates carbon monoxide (CO). These compounds are notable because they are difficult to degrade [1–3]. Sulfur dioxide is a major air pollutant. When combined with atmospheric moisture, sulfur dioxide causes acid rainfall, and in oil fractions, sulfur dioxide is highly undesirable because it causes equipment corrosion [4,5]. Therefore, the environmental problems arising from the release of SOx into the atmosphere have been the subject of research worldwide. Traditionally, sulfur removal from various refinery loads is accomplished through the hydrodesulfurization process using catalysts based on molybdenum or tungsten sulfides promoted by cobalt or nickel sulfides and using alumina as a support [6–9]. The decreased quality of the loads and increased rigidity of environmental control laws require increasingly drastic operating conditions, such as using high temperatures and pressures, which inevitably lead to higher hydrogen consumption and higher investments [10–13]. To meet the limits imposed by environmental control laws, several strategies have been used, such as the use of new catalysts or the development of new processes [14–19]. Among the new technologies studied, oxidative desulfurization (ODS) should be highlighted, as this method can be conducted under much milder conditions than traditional hydrodesulfurization and is characterized by low temperature (even room temperature) and atmospheric pressure, with the great advantage of not requiring hydrogen in the process [20–23]. Despite the mild operating conditions, oxidative desulfurization presents high efficiency and selectivity, and when combined with the extraction process, ODS becomes one of the most promising methods of desulfurization and is applicable to several of the petroleum charges present in a refinery [12,16]. In the last two decades, the use of molecular sieves, such as zeolites, as supports or catalysts in various processes, such as petroleum refining and environmental control, has intensified [24–33]. However, there are still few studies reported in the literature that use zeolites as catalysts or supports in the process of oxidative desulfurization [34,35]. Therefore, it is necessary to study the ODS process of real loads by evaluating different zeolites as supports for active phases in the process of oxidative desulfurization. Few studies have reported using manganese as the active phase in the ODS process [36]; however, there has been an increase in the use of vanadium in this process [37–46], although vanadium is more toxic than manganese. The main objective of this work is to evaluate the potential use of different zeolites as a support for vanadium or manganese catalysts for the oxidative desulfurization of a sulfide compound (dibenzothiophene) present in an actual diesel charge. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Synthesis of the catalysts Commercial zeolites Beta CP 811 (SiO2/Al2O3 = 34), Mordenite CBV 10A (MOR) (SiO2/Al2O3 = 13), NaX and NaY (SiO2/Al2O3 = 5.1) were purchased from Zeolyst, and ZSM-5 3020, ZSM-5 5020 and ZSM-5 8020 (SiO2/Al2O3 = 35, 53 and 75, respectively) were supplied by ITQ (Institute of Chemical Technology of the Polytechnic University of Valencia). The sources of vanadium and manganese used as the active phase were ammonium metavanadate (Nuclear, PA) and manganese(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Vetec, PA). Impregnation of the active phases (1 wt% V or 1 wt% Mn) was performed by incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) at 353 K for 2 h under reflux employing the zeolite and aqueous solution of the active phases (solid/liquid ratio of 2 g/20 mL). After that, the solvent was evaporated in a rotary evaporator maintained at 363 K, and then, the samples were oven dried at 353 K. After the drying step, the samples were calcined at 773 K for 3 h for getting de oxide phases. 2.2 Characterization of the catalysts X-ray diffraction was used to confirm the structures of the various zeolites used as supports and to verify if the incorporation of vanadium or manganese led to structural modification. A Shimadzu diffractometer (model XRD-7000) with copper radiation (CuKα, λ = 1.5418 Å) and operated at 30 kV and 30 mA was used. The data were collected in the 2θ range from 3 to 50° with a velocity of 2.0°/min and a step count of 0.6 s. The specific area of the materials and pore size distribution were obtained by nitrogen adsorption using the BET method. Textural characterization of the materials was performed using a Quantachrome Autosorb-1 apparatus (Nova-2200e). Prior to the analysis, approximately 100 mg of the samples was vacuum treated at a temperature of 573 K for 3 h. The measurements were performed at the temperature of liquid N2 (77 K). The morphology of several of the samples was studied by scanning electron microscopy using a scanning electron microscope model ESEM-XL30 PHILIPS (voltage of 20.00 kV). Prior to analysis, the samples were coated with a gold layer. The distribution of the chemical elements in the catalysts was determined by EMPA-EDS on a Shimadzu EPMA 1720H microprobe analyzer, equipped with an elemental X-ray dispersive energy analysis system. Acidity measurements of the catalysts were performed by the adsorption of n-butylamine vapor, followed by desorption monitored in a thermobalance. Desorption was performed with a thermogravimetric analyzer (NETZSCH TG 209F3) under nitrogen flowing at 25 mL/min with a heating ramp of 10 °C/min to determine the amount of base desorbed in each temperature range. Prior to adsorption, the calcined samples were submitted to activation at 673 K for 2 h under an N2 atmosphere. Then, the temperature was lowered to 368 K, and n-butylamine vapor was passed through the sample for 1 h. Finally, the samples were again submitted to N2 flow at 368 K to remove physically adsorbed n-butylamine. The number of molecules of n-butylamine adsorbed at each acid site was calculated by Eq. (1), and the number of sites per mass of the sample was calculated by Eq. (2). (1) n(n-butylamine) = m(n-butylamine)/MM(n-butylamine) (2) N = n(n-butylamine)/m(catalyst) Where n(n-butylamine) is the number of n-butylamine molecules, m(n-butylamine) is the mass of adsorbed n-butylamine, MM(n-butylamine) is the molecular mass of n-butylamine (73.14 g mol−1), N is the number of acid sites, and m(catalyst) is the mass of the n-butylamine-free catalyst. 2.3 Catalytic evaluation The catalytic oxidation of DBT, employing hydrogen peroxide (Vetec, 30% wt.%) as an oxidizing agent and acetonitrile (Vetec, 99.8%) as a solvent, was performed in batch using an orbital shaker. In a typical experiment, 100 mg of the catalyst was suspended under stirring at 200 rpm in 10 mL of a mixture containing 1000 mg/L dibenzothiophene (Aldrich, 98%) added to commercial diesel (S1800), solvent (diesel/solvent 2:1, v/v) and H2O2 (0.5 mL) at a constant temperature (328 K) for 2 h. The reaction product was filtered to remove the catalyst. To remove water generated during the reaction by the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, anhydrous sodium sulfite (Kinetic, PA) was added (Fig. 1 ). The phases (oil/solvent) were separated by filtration and possibly the settling step, and the reaction products (solvent phase) were quantitatively analyzed by GC-FID (Varian CP-3800) using a CPSil 5CB capillary column (30 m × 0.53 mm × 5 μm) with the following analysis conditions: detector temperature of 623 K, injector temperature of 543 K, column flow rate (QHe) of 3.0 mL/min and total analysis time of 70 min. The column was heated from 313 K to 523 K at a rate of 5 °C/min and maintained at this temperature for 28 min. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of the catalysts Fig. 2 shows the characteristic diffractograms of each zeolitic structure, and the respective structures match those reported in the literature [47]. The characteristic reflections of vanadium or manganese oxide were not observed either due to the high dispersion of the active phase on the support or because the impregnated amount allowed the formation of particles with sizes smaller than the limit of detection of the equipment. The same phenomenon was observed by Feng and Wang [47,48]. The adsorption isotherms (not shown) were constructed from the nitrogen adsorption results, and it was observed that the supports (zeolites) produce isotherms typical of microporous materials. For the ZSM-5 and Beta materials before and after impregnation with the metals (Table 1 ), the area and volumes values after the impregnation of the metals remain approximately equal to the values before impregnation. This indicates that vanadium is uniformly distributed on the surface of these materials without destroying the structure of the material (also evidenced by XRD). Decreases in the specific area, micropore area and micropore volume for the mordenite, NaX and NaY zeolites was observed after impregnation of both vanadium and manganese, but the decreases were more pronounced for the vanadium-impregnated samples. These decrease in the specific area and volume of the micropores are related to the penetration of the metal oxides into the pores of the zeolites. For the same samples impregnated with Mn, the decreases in the specific areas and micropore volumes are lower than those for vanadium, indicating that the vanadium oxide species (V2O5) occupy more space in the pores of these zeolites than the manganese oxide species. No decrease in the specific area after impregnation with V or Mn was observed for the ZSM-5 samples; however, small decreases in the micropore volumes were observed for the ZSM-5 3020 sample. This different behavior of ZSM-5 and the other zeolites is related to the size of their micropores; the micropores of ZSM-5 are smaller than the micropores of the other zeolites, indicating that impregnation preferentially occurred on the external surface of these zeolites, and therefore, there was no migration of the metal oxide species to the interior pores. The micrographs of the zeolite samples before and after impregnation of the metal phases are shown in Fig. 3 . In all cases, the corresponding typical morphology of each structure (ZSM-5, NaX, NaY, beta and mordenite) was observed, and it was not possible to observe any change in the morphology after impregnation of the metals. As there was no change in the morphology and in agreement with the XRD and textural analyses, it was confirmed that impregnated species were uniformly distributed, with no agglomeration of the metal oxides. Some of the catalysts (ZSM-5 5020 V, MOR V and NaY V) containing V2O5 were further analyzed by EMPA-EDS. A good distribution of V in these materials was again observed (Fig. 4 ). However, it is not possible to identify whether V is inside or outside of the zeolite structure by this analysis technique. Table 2 shows the results of the EDS analysis, which verified that the proposed amount of metal was impregnated in the zeolite (1 wt.% V), but because this was a point analysis, at some points, slight agglomeration of the metal was observed, for example, MOR V presented 1.53 wt.% vanadium. n-Butylamine adsorption assays were performed on some of the catalysts used in this study. The desorption of n-butylamine was followed by thermogravimetric analysis, which provided information on the strength of the acid centers present in the material. For this analysis, catalysts before impregnation of the metals and after impregnation were examined to evaluate the change in acid centers due to the presence of the metals. Fig. 5 shows the thermogravimetric analysis results of 3 samples after n-butylamine adsorption (more thermogravimetric results is on Supplementary material Fig. S1). The TG/DTG curves showed four stages of mass loss corresponding to the desorption and thermal decomposition of n-butylamine. The mass loss events were attributed to the presence of weak (I and/or II), moderate (III) and strong (IV) acid centers. The relative strengths of the acid centers in the adsorbed catalysts are listed in Table 3 . Events I and II (300–590 K) are attributed to the desorption of water molecules and n-butylamine adsorbed at weak acid centers, event III (530–711) is attributed to the decomposition of n-butylamine in butene and ammonia over moderate acid centers, and event IV (700–900 K) is attributed to the degradation of diamines [49–51]. The n-butylamine adsorption results showed an increase in the total acidity of the material with impregnation of the metals (V or Mn), with the exception of the ZSM-5 8020 series, where a decrease in the total acidity was observed. In addition, the change in the type of acid center can be visualized. For the ZSM-5 3020 series of catalysts, the appearance of strong acid centers after impregnation was observed, which was most pronounced with V impregnation (for the ZSM-5 3020 V catalyst). 3.2 Catalytic test In this desulfurization process, the extraction and oxidation steps occur simultaneously, and an illustration of this process can be seen in Fig. 6 a. Both the oxidation of the DBT to its sulfone (DBTO2) and the subsequent extraction step, as well as the removal of the non-oxidized DBT by extraction, occur. An interface is formed between the oil phase (diesel) and the extraction phase (acetonitrile), where the oxidation of dibenzothiophene occurs. Reactions occurring at the liquid-liquid interface are demonstrated in Fig. 6b, taking the vanadium-containing catalyst as an example. This is a proposed mechanism based on the literature [52–54]. The catalytic results obtained from the oxidative desulfurization of dibenzothiophene using different synthesized catalysts are shown in Fig. 7 . The presented results were obtained from the addition of 1000 ppm of the dibenzothiophene to commercial diesel. It was found that 100% of the sulfur added to the diesel charge was removed from the solvent phase. In the solvent phase, two reaction products were observed: unreacted dibenzothiophene, which could only be removed by solvent extraction (not shown), and dibenzothiophene, which underwent oxidation. No formation of intermediate sulfur compounds was detected under the studied conditions. Preliminary experiments were performed in the absence of the catalyst, and only 6% of DBT was oxidized and 60% was extracted. By analyzing the obtained results, it can be observed that the structure of the zeolite has no influence on the oxidation reaction, and we can also rule out a possible spatial impediment of the hydrogen peroxide molecule. Vanadium oxides were more active for the oxidation of dibenzothiophene in relation to manganese oxides under the examined conditions. Other studies [36–38,43] in which different vanadium-containing catalysts were applied to the oxidative desulfurization of diesel also obtained good catalytic activity. From Fig. 7, we can see that the ZSM-5 series catalysts impregnated with vanadium presented the highest oxidation rates. The ZSM-5 5020 V catalyst exhibited a conversion of approximately 80%, followed by the ZSM-5 3020 V catalyst with a conversion of approximately 60% and, finally, the 80% ZSM-5 8020 V catalyst. The oxidation percentages of the other catalysts were between 8–33%. The low amount of oxidation by the other vanadium-containing zeolites may have occurred because in some carriers, the metals may possibly retard oxidation by the active phase. For example, vanadium has been mentioned as one of the problems that the FCC process faces because the catalyst used in the process (zeolite Y) is poisoned and deactivated by vanadium. According to the literature, vanadium species neutralize the Brønsted acid sites in silica-containing substrates, and this may have occurred in our zeolite-supported catalysts. As vanadium was deposited on the surface of the zeolites, we can also deduce that vanadium was able to move across the surface of the zeolitic carrier to reach the acid sites [56]. In relation to the influence of acidity on the results, it was observed that the ZSM-5 zeolites with higher Si/Al ratios obtained the best performance. The increased aluminum concentration in ZSM-5 induces an increase in the number of acid centers, which tend to remain in a highly diluted state, since ZSM-5 contains a relatively high proportion of silica. This behavior is in contrast to other molecular sieves with low Si content, such as zeolite Y, which contain so many aluminum sites that their overall acidity increases when aluminum is removed [57]. Based on this fact, the best result obtained with ZSM-5 5020, which has a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 53, can be attributed to the fact that the sites are better distributed in comparison to the other catalysts, such as ZSM-5 3020, which has a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 35, and thus, the sites would be closer, or 8020, in which the sites would be far apart. The good conversion of dibenzothiophene to dibenzothiophene sulfone in the ZSM-5 zeolites with vanadium can be attributed to the type of acid center provided by this metal, which in this case, would be the appearance of strong acid centers, which should favor the dissociation of the peroxide and consequently lead to increased oxidation. Another important factor, described in the literature [58], that could explain the high activity of this zeolite is the fact that zeolites with low Si/Al content have hydrophilic character, and therefore, ZSM-5 would have a more hydrophobic character and greater resistance to deactivation by water, which is generated during the reaction. The influence of the pore size on the catalyst activity was also evaluated, and the zeolites with larger pores, such as X, Y or Beta, were less active than the ZSM-5 series catalysts, which have smaller pores, as observed in Table 1, which shows the results of the N2 adsorption-desorption analysis. Because of the larger pores, the hydrogen peroxide molecules may potentially not interact with the active centers contained in the walls of the pores, which is necessary for decomposition to occur. The ZSM-5 series are advantageous because they contain smaller pores, which allows more contact of the oxidant with the active centers, allowing decomposition to occur more easily and releasing radicals for the oxidation reaction to occur. On the other hand, vanadium impregnation in ZSM-5 occurred partially on the outer surface (as proven by XRD and specific area), thus making these metals more accessible for the reaction. Perhaps the influence of the specific area was better observed with higher levels of metals. The catalysts containing manganese were more efficient in the removal of DBT by the simple extraction process (results on Fig. S2 on Supplementary Material), showing a higher removal for the manganese-impregnated ZSM-5 8020 catalyst. The good oxidation rate of the vanadium-containing catalysts is also due to homolytic mechanism (radical pathway, according to Fig. 4b), predominantly through the cleavage and activation of H2O2 by the vanadium species. This type of mechanism provides high redox potential and easy redox transition (V5+ ↔ V4+), making the catalyst active for the selective oxidation of organic compounds in the presence of hydrogen peroxide [46,54,55,59,60]. 4 Conclusion The incorporation of vanadium and manganese in the materials did not compromise the structure of the materials. In some materials, a reduction in the specific area occurred upon incorporation of the metallic oxides in the structure. A sulfur compound added to commercial diesel was efficiently removed under the studied conditions in 100% yield. The vanadium-containing materials showed greater activity for the oxidation of dibenzothiophene; however, the manganese-impregnated materials presented higher efficiency in the removal of dibenzothiophene from diesel through extraction. The ZSM-5 zeolite was more efficient for the oxidation reaction. The acidity of the supports and the vanadium distribution seem to influence the oxidation activity, whereas the specific area has no influence. It is concluded that the desulfurization of dibenzothiophene-doped commercial diesel can be achieved by the ODS process in the presence of vanadium-based catalysts, in particular, with the use of ZSM-5 zeolites.

        "dc:description": "With growing concern about the environment, the oil industry has become interested in new technologies that reduce costs by increasing the efficiency of removing sulfur compounds from fossil fuels. Oxidative desulfurization is an interesting sulfur-removal process for the petroleum industry because it uses mild reaction conditions. In this work, zeolites (ZSM-5, NaX, NaY, Beta and Mordenite) impregnated with 1% vanadium or manganese were used for the oxidation and extraction of dibenzothiophene (DBT) from a diesel load. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption-desorption textural analysis and scanning electron microscopy, and the reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC-FID). It was found that vanadium or manganese impregnation did not significantly modify the structure of the zeolites. The vanadium-impregnated zeolite ZSM-5 showed the best result in the oxidation of dibenzothiophene, oxidizing up to 80% of the DBT added in the diesel charge (ZSM-5 5020 V). The manganese-based catalysts were not as active for this oxidation, and the best performance was found for the removal of DBT by extraction.",
