Ltd., Wuxi 214443, Jiangsu, China Abstract: By deposition-precipitation with urea method, gold was loaded on mesoporous TiO 2 whisker, which was prepared from a po- tassium titanate whisker precursor through solid phase sintering process. The morphology and structure of these as-prepared catalysts were characterized by N 2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy. The reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol by NaBH 4 was evaluated as a probe reaction. After calcination at high temperature, the activity of the catalysts supported on mesoporous TiO 2 nanofiber was well maintained, and the particle size of gold nanoparticles was hardly changed. This might be attributed to the peculiar crystallographic structure and mesoporous nanoarchitecture of the mesoporous TiO 2 whisker. Key words: nanogold; thermal stability; mesoporous titania; bicrystal; p-nitrophenol; reduction Supported nanogold catalysts have attracted much attention for their high activity and efficiency in various heterogeneous catalytic reactions [1â€“4]. Although the nature of the active sites is still debatable, it is widely accepted that well dispersed gold particles with high thermal stability and strong adhesive force are essential for developing advanced gold catalysts with stable performances [5,6]. High thermal stability assures less ag- glomeration of gold nanoparticles. Strong adhesion prevents the active components loss during the reaction processes. There are mainly two types of methods developed to improve the thermal stability of gold nanoparticles and their adhesion to support materials. One is developing a support with proper nanostructures [7â€“9]. The other is modifying gold catalysts with oxide surface layers [10,11]. Due to the complexity and high cost of the synthetic process of the latter method, choosing porous substrates is considered as a more feasible way. Based on this concept, nanogold catalysts with high thermal stability and stable anchoring properties have been successively de- veloped by confining the presynthesized gold clusters into hierarchic porous oxide materials [5,7,12]. Because of the high reactivity and possible strong metal support interaction (SMSI) effects [13], titania is thought to be the most prominent oxide support material for gold nanoparti- cles. However, the porous architectures of titania materials with high surface area always tend to collapse at high tem- perature, which further decrease the usability as a gold catalyst support. Besides, the complex synthetic procedures and re- sidual impurities of porous titania architectures also limit their applications. In our previous work, we synthesized a highly crystallized mesoporous titania nanofiber with high thermal stability, in which the specific surface area of 139 m 2 /g was maintained after calcination at 500 Â°C for 2 h [14]. Our recent study also revealed that the mesoporous titania nanofiber prepared from K 2 Ti 2 O 5 was a core-shell structured TiO 2 (B)-anatase bicrystal- line titania (denoted as mb-TiO 2 ) [15,16]. Stable anchoring of Pt nanoparticles onto this core-shell structured titania resulted in a rather higher and more stable photocatalytic hydrogen production performance [17]. The mesoporous titania nanofi- ber was also used as a gold catalyst support [9,18]. Compared with commercial nonporous P25 (Degussa AG) gold loaded on mesoporous titania nanofiber performed a better activity in low-temperature CO oxidation. However, the thermal stability of the Au/TiO 2 catalyst based on the mesoporous bicrystalline MA Xuanxuan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1480â€“1485 titania was not evaluated yet. In the present paper, the Au/TiO 2 catalyst prepared by homogeneous deposition-precipitation method was treated at high temperature under inert atmosphere and then tested in the catalytic reduction of p-nitrophenol (PNP) to investigate its thermal stability. 1 Experimental 1.1 Preparation of TiO 2 (B) coated mesoporous anatase nanofiber and gold catalysts TiO 2 (B) coated anatase nanofiber was prepared by following our previous work [15]. Calcination of the dried sample was performed in a muffle oven at 600 Â°C in air for 2 h. After cooling naturally, TiO 2 (B) coated mesoporous anatase nano- fibers were synthesized (denoted as mb-TiO 2 ). Gold (2.0 wt%) was deposited on as-synthesized TiO 2 nan- ofibers by deposition-precipitation with urea method. In a typical procedure, excess urea (7.56 g) was dissolved in 300 ml of 0.52 mmol/L HAuCl 4 solution at room temperature. About 1.5 g titania support was then added into the yellow solution, the resulting mixture was heated at 80 Â°C for 3 h under vig- orous stirring. The suspension was then filtered and washed several times until no chloride ions were detected by AgNO 3 solution. The solid product was oven-dried at 60 Â°C for 12 h and calcined at 300 Â°C for 2 h in static air before subsequent modification or activity evaluation. In order to investigate the thermal stability of the nanogold catalyst, the fresh Au/mb-TiO 2 was further calcined at 500 Â°C for 2 h in flowing helium gas (50 ml/min) before activity test. The recalcined gold catalyst was denoted as Au/mb-TiO 2 -R. For comparison, gold was loaded on commercial titania (P25, AEROXIDE) and recalcined following the same procedure. The recalcined Au/P25 was further denoted as Au/P25-R. 1.2 Characterization techniques The crystal phase of the raw material and products was de- termined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8, Cu K Ä® radiation). The sample morphology was evaluated by trans- mission electron microscopy (TEM, Philips Tecnai G220 S-TWIN) at 200 kV. The textural properties were studied by N 2 adsorption-desorption measurements (ASAP 2020M) at liquid nitrogen temperature. Before analysis, the samples were de- gassed for 2 h at 150 Â°C under vacuum. The gold content of catalysts was detected by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, Optima 2000DV, USA). 1.3 Catalytic performance Catalytic activity measurements were performed for the reduction of PNP to p-aminophenol (PAP) by NaBH 4 (liquid phase) at room temperature. The typical reduction procedure was carried out as follows: 50 mg Au/TiO 2 catalyst was quickly added into 60 ml aqueous solution mixed PNP (3 mmol/L) and NaBH 4 (0.05 mol/L), and then the mixture was vigorously stirred at room temperature until the yellow solution became colorless. The reduction process was monitored by measuring the extinction of solution at 400 nm as a function of time using a spectrophotometer (UNICO UV-2802S). 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Structure properties of catalysts The phase constitutions of TiO 2 and the gold loaded samples were shown in Fig. 1. Obviously, we can find that almost all the diffraction peaks of the Au/TiO 2 samples can be indexed to (101), (004), and (200) peaks, corresponding to anatase type TiO 2 (JCPDS 21-1272). (110) and (101) peaks of rutile type TiO 2 were also detected in Au/P25 and Au/P25-R, indicating the mixed phase nature of commercial P25 titania. Besides anatase phase, characteristic peaks of TiO 2 (B) phase were also confirmed in Fig. 1(1) and (2), which was consistent with our previous work [14â€“16]. Moreover, no rutile type TiO 2 were observed in Au/mb-TiO 2 after thermal treatment, which re- flected the high phase stability of mb-TiO 2 . No gold peaks were shown in the XRD patterns, which might be attributed to the high dispersion of gold and/or the very low gold loading. N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of mb-TiO 2 , Au/mb-TiO 2 , and Au/mb-TiO 2 -R samples were shown in Fig. 2. These three samples have similar type IV isotherms. The N 2 adsorption amounts are nearly unchanged after loading gold and treating at high temperature, indicating that the mesopor- ous architecture was well maintained not only after gold loading but even after thermal treatment at 500 Â°C for 2 h. Itâ€™s a crucial and positive factor for developing thermal stable gold catalyst. Meanwhile, the loaded gold nanoparticles were con- sidered to be in a well dispersed condition since the BET sur- face area and pore volume of the catalyst were almost the same 10 20 30 40 50 60 Anatase TiO 2 (B) Rutile 2T/( o ) I n t e n s i t y (1) (2) (3) (4) Fig. 1.

MA Xuanxuan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1480â€“1485 as the titania support itself (shown in Table 1). The nanopores of the titania support was not easily blocked by the gold nanoparticles. That might be attributed to the rather larger pore size compared with the gold particle size and also the low gold loading amount in the catalyst. These results were first proved by the pore size distributions of these samples calculated by applying the BJH approach to the desorption branches of the corresponding isotherms, as shown in Fig. 2. The pore size distributions of all the samples were relatively narrow and centered at around 10 nm. There is only a small change in the pore size distribution for the sample after high temperature treatment, which was attributed to the slight growth of the titania nanocrystals. Table 1 summarized the physical proper- ties of the supports and catalysts. Specifically, the BET surface area of mb-TiO 2 was 56.1 m 2 /g, and slightly higher than that of commercial P25 (50.2 m 2 /g). Moreover, the BET surface areas for both samples were not decreased obviously after loading gold and the further high temperature treatment. Electron microscopy techniques were used to investigate the microstructures and morphologies of both the titania support and the gold nanoparticles. TEM image of a typical mb-TiO 2 sample is shown in Fig. 3(a). The nanofibrous morphology was derived from the titanate precursor. Most of the samples were nanofibers with uniform size and had good nanofiber mor- phology, their average diameter was 0.1â€“0.3 Î¼m and the av- erage length was 1.5â€“5.0 Î¼m. A deep insight into the fine structure of Au/mb-TiO 2 and Au/mb-TiO 2 -R can be obtained by further TEM and HRTEM observations. Figures 3(b) and (d) showed the larger scale TEM images of Au/mb-TiO 2 and Au/mb-TiO 2 -R, respectively. It reveals that gold loaded nano- fibers kept the same morphology as mb-TiO 2 and the gold nanoparticles were well dispersed both on the outer surface and in the mesopores of mesoporous titania nanofibers, even after high temperature treatment. In addition, we focused on the particle size distributions of the gold nanoparticles before and after thermal treatment. On our previous assumption (from N 2 adsorption-desorption results), the particle size of gold might be less than the pore diameter of the titania support, thus, nu- merous 5â€“15 nm diameter bright spots in Figs. 3(b) and (d) must correspond to the mesopores of mb-TiO 2 , which were well arranged along the longitudinal direction of the nanofiber. In the same direction, 20â€“30 nm wide nanocrystallites aligned loosely, with mesopores presented between them. The dark spots in Figs. 3(b) and (d) were then considered as gold nanoparticles. That was also proved by a typical HRTEM investigation of a single gold nanoparticle on the Au/mb-TiO 2 sample, shown in Fig. 3(c). The d spacing of the ellipsoidal particle was measured as 0.23 nm, which was considered as the typical (111) plane distance of metallic gold. Furthermore, at least three different directional lattice fringes of 0.23 nm were observed, which indicate that the gold nanoparticle is a highly crystallized polycrystalline cluster. In order to investigate the effect of high temperature treatment on the average gold par- ticle size, more TEM images of Au/mb-TiO 2 and Au/mb-TiO 2 -R were recorded. Though the similar preparation method was used as in the literatures [19,20], much larger gold particles were obtained in the present work. That might be attributed to the different preparation conditions. From our previous work [9], the gold loading is set as 1.0 wt%, which was insufficient for the precise average particle size calculation. However, the average gold particle size data which will be obtained in the present work should be much more reasonable because of the rather higher gold loading and the more uniform dispersion behavior.

It was found that after high temperature treatment, the gold nanoparticles size on mb-TiO 2 sample increased slightly from (6.6Â±1.6) nm to (7.3Â±1.4) nm, while that on commercial P25 titania nanopowder grew dramatically from (6.4Â±1.3) nm (Fig. 3(e)) to (11.0Â±2.1) nm (Fig. 3(f)). The his- tograms of gold particles size distribution for the catalysts were also shown in Fig. 4. From the above TEM analysis, we can find that gold nanoparticles were more stable on the mesoporous titania nanofiber than on commercial P25 when the gold catalysts were treated at 500 Â°C for 2 h in helium atmosphere. This result was briefly attributed to the distinct support effect since the same synthesis parameters were introduced for both gold catalysts. Despite the gold catalysts supported on different types of supports [21,22], even for the ideal titania surface [23], the localized conditions (reduced, oxidized, or hydrated sur- faces) will have great effect on the nucleation and bonding behaviors of nanogold clusters. In this work, the gold-titania interface of Au/mb-TiO 2 was different from any conventional Au/TiO 2 catalysts due to the peculiar TiO 2 (B) coated anatase architecture of the mesoporous titania nanofiber. Recently, TiO 2 (B) materials have received much attention for their out- standing performances in Li + ion battery [24], photocatalysis [15â€“17], and other environmental and energy related applica- tions. However, to the best of our knowledge, TiO 2 (B) materi- als have never been applied as a support of nanogold catalysts. Due to the metastable structural features and the lower ther- modynamic stability of TiO 2 (B) with respect to rutile, anatase, and brookite TiO 2 , different metal support interaction was expected for Au/mb-TiO 2 . The highly crystallized surface TiO 2 (B) layers must play an important role in stabilizing the gold nanoparticles. Besides, the special mesoporous structure should also be taken into account. Considering that the pore diameter of mesoporous titania nanofiber was only slightly larger than the average particle size of gold, each gold nanoparticle should be located into one nanopore, which was constructed by the directionally three-dimensional assembly of titania nanocrystallites. The nanoarchitecture not only provided anchoring sites for the gold nanoparticles but also prolonged the distance between the nearest gold nanoparticles, which were all beneficial for preventing gold nanoparticles or atoms from migration and agglomeration.

MA Xuanxuan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1480â€“1485 2.2 PNP reduction In order to understand the thermal stability of gold nanoparticles, PNP reduction was introduced as a model reac- tion to test the catalytic performances of the gold catalysts before and after thermal treatment. The catalytic activities of both the fresh and recalcined catalysts were presented in Fig. 5. The ratio of C t and C 0 , where C t and C 0 represent PNP con- centrations at time t and 0, respectively, was measured from the relative intensity of the respective absorbances. The linear relations of ln(C 0 /C t ) versus time were observed for all the tested catalysts, indicating that the PNP reduction reaction followed first-order kinetics. The rate constants were also estimated from first order reaction kinetics using the slopes of straight lines in Fig. 5. The rate constants decreased from 0.134 to 0.097 min 1 when Au/P25 was recalcined at 500 Â°C, while the reaction rate on Au/mb-TiO 2 was nearly maintained as 0.15 min 1 (Table 1). The kinetic reaction rate constants, k, with different gold contents supported on mb-TiO 2 were shown in Fig. 6. In the range of 0.5% 2% loading amount, all the catalysts showed the similar activation after recalcination. This indicates that gold nanoparticles were more stable on the mesoporous titania nanofiber, which was consistent with the TEM results. It was reported that an increase of the particle size always leads to a decrease in the fraction of low coordination metal sites such as vertices, edges, and kinks, which can promote the adsorption of reactants and facilitate the reaction. The decrease of the reac- tion rate of Au/P25 might be attributed to this reason. In this reaction, the gold nanoparticles played a key role as an electron transfer mediator between BH 4 and PNP molecules [25]. The catalytic rate of the gold catalysts depends mainly on the availability of the active surface area. Here, for the gold nanoparticles supported on mesoporous titania nanofiber, the slight particle growth assured a similar total metal surface area available for the reactant adsorption and activation. This as- sumption was experimentally confirmed by the apparent size-controlled activity for the gold catalysts in PNP reduction. The stable PNP reduction performance and sinter-resistant behavior of Au/mb-TiO 2 -R suggested that the titania nanofiber with the peculiar crystallographic structure and mesoporous nanoarchitecture could be used as an excellent sinter-resistant support material for other noble metal nanocatalysts. 3 Conclusions The thermal stability of gold catalysts supported on the mesoporous titania nanofiber and commercial P25 materials were compared by using PNP reduction as a model reaction. From TEM images, it seems that gold nanoparticles size on the mesoporous titania nanofiber was nearly maintained after calcination at high temperature, while that supported on P25 changed dramatically. It indicates that titania nanofiber with the peculiar crystallographic structure and mesoporous na- noarchitecture could be used as an excellent sinter-resistant support material for other noble metal nanocatalysts. This result was also experimentally confirmed by the p-nitrophenol reduction reaction. References 1 Haruta M, Kobayashi T, Sano H, Yamada N.

Adv Mater, 2008, 20: 1523 he catalytic rate of the gold catalysts depends mainly on the availability of the active surface area. Here, for the gold nanoparticles supported on mesoporous titania nanofiber, the slight particle growth assured a similar total metal surface area available for the reactant adsorption and activation. This as- sumption was experimentally confirmed by the apparent size-controlled activity for the gold catalysts in PNP reduction. The stable PNP reduction performance and sinter-resistant behavior of Au/mb-TiO 2 -R suggested that the titania nanofiber with the peculiar crystallographic structure and mesopor CHNJC 60415 S1872-2067(11)60415-4 10.1016/S1872-2067(11)60415-4 Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, the Chinese Academy of Sciences This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (20736002, 20976080, 21136001) and the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program, 2006AA03Z455).

The morphology and structure of these as-prepared catalysts were characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy. The reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol by NaBH4 was evaluated as a probe reaction. After calcination at high temperature, the activity of the catalysts supported on mesoporous TiO2 nanofiber was well maintained, and the particle size of gold nanoparticles was hardly changed. This might be attributed to the peculiar crystallographic structure and mesoporous nanoarchitecture of the mesoporous TiO2 whisker. 摘要 以二钛酸钾晶须为前驱体, 通过固相烧结工艺制备了介孔 TiO2 晶须, 然后使用沉积沉淀法将 Au 纳米颗粒担载于其上, 并采用低温 N2 吸附-脱附 X 射线衍射及透射电镜等技术对催化剂的形貌和结构进行了表征, 以 NaBH4 还原对硝基苯酚 (PNP) 为探针反应, 评价了催化剂的活性及稳定性. 结果表明, 500 丰C 热处理前后, 介孔 TiO2 负载的 Au 纳米颗粒的平均粒径变化不大, 且催化 PNP 还原活性得到了很好的保持. 这主要与介孔 TiO2 晶须独特的双晶构型及介孔结构有关.
