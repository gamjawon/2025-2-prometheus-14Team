Milburn, Burtron H. Davis Center for Applied Energy Research, 3572 Iron Works Pike, Lexington, KY 40511, USA Received 22 April 1996; accepted 31 December 1996 Abstract Structural characterization of Co-Al and Ni-Al coprecipitated catalysts has been accomplished using techniques such as X-ray diffraction, DTA, TGA, TG-MS, BET surface area and pore volume. The catalyst samples were prepared by coprecipitation of cobalt (or nickel) and aluminum from their aqueous salt solutions. The interaction of Co (or Ni) with aluminum has been investigated by X-ray diffraction as a function of calcination temperature. The results indicate that the interaction between Co and A1 can lead to the formation of a normal spinel of COA1204 at a very low temperature such as 473 K. On the other hand the interaction between Ni and A1 is not sufficient to form well crystallized NiA1204 species at low temperatures but nickel-alun-iinate formation was seen above 973 K. The activity and selectivity of these catalysts for 2-octanol conversion are dependent on the reaction temperature, liquid hour space velocity (LHSV) as well as on the calcination temperature. The dehydrogenation activity of nickel based catalysts is attributed to the presence of nickel oxide whereas the dehydration activity is due to the spinel phase. The differences in the dehydration activity between alumina and nickel-alumina is mostly because of the incomplete formation of spinel phase (i.e., low temperature calcined samples). Catalytic activity of cobalt-alumina catalysts is comparable with that of alumina catalysts towards 2-octanol conversion.

Introduction Supported metal oxide catalysts attract much attention because of their wide application in a variety of industrially important reactions. The nature and extent of interaction between the support material and the dispersed metal oxide species are widely studied. These may depend upon the method of preparation, concentration of metal species in the catalyst, nature of the Corresponding author. 1381-1169/97/$17.00 Copyright 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. P1IS1381-1169(97)00018-6 support, calcination temperature, and duration of calcination [1-9]. Although supported metal oxide systems have been the subject of numerous investigations, the nature of the interaction between the support and metal species in many systems is still not understood clearly. At one extreme of metal support interactions, interoxidic spinel compounds may be formed. The ideal spinel structure consists of a cubic close-packed array of anions, with one eighth of the tetrahedral and one half of the octahedral interstices occupied by cations, so that the cation to anion ratio is 3:4. In a binary oxide spinel [8], AB204, 158 S. Choam et at. jJournai of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 121 (1997) 157-169 two extreme distributions of cations among the available tetrahedral and octahedral sites are possible (the ions in parentheses occupy octahedral sites): the `normal' distribution with A(B2)04 and the `inverse' distribution with B(AB)04. In normal bimetallic spinels (i.e., CoA1204), the Al\" ions are located in octahedral sites and they are considered to have weak acidity [1]. On the other hand, in inverse bimetallic spinels (i.e., N'A1204) the Al3+ ions are expected to be in tetrahedral coordination sites and they are expected to exhibit significant acidic character [I]. Several surface models concerning the interaction between a metal oxide and y alumina have been proposed in literature. The model proposed by Hercules et al. [3] for y-alumina supported nickel oxide allows Ni2+ ions to diffuse into the surface lattice vacancies of the alumina spinel structure. A major interest in Co/A1203 catalysts has centered on interactions between the metal and support. It is known that metal-support interactions may appreciably affect the surface properties of these catalysts, and hence their reactivities. The migration of metal ions into the alumina matrix is a common phenomenon in metal supported catalysts and it has been reported that the migration process may be limited to the first few layers of the support [9]. It has been reported that in Co/A1203 catalysts the surface consists of dispersed COA1204 spinel at low loading while at higher loading, crystallite C0304 is also present. Arnoldy and Mou1jin [9] have identified, through TPR studies, a number of phases that are present in these catalysts. Recently Murthy and Swamy [7] reported the synthesis and characterization of coprecipitated Co-Al mixed oxide catalysts. According to these authors the stoichiornetry of the mixed oxide can be represented as Cot,+x)Alc2-x504 (where x = 0 to 1). According to Murthy and Swamy [7] the activity for the dehydration of 2-propanol is predominant at x = 0 and for the dehydrogenation reaction at x = 1. The authors also indicated that the dehydration activity for 2-propanol resides predominantly with the Al 3+ ions located in the tetrahedral coordination sites of the spinel and that the dehydrogenation activity results from Co\" sites located in the octahedral coordination sites of the spinel. In alumina, the A13+ occupies both the tetrahedral and octahedral sites. It is possible for the two sites to have different catalytic properties for alcohol dehydration, both with respect to activity and selectivity. If this is the case, the normal spinel (i.e., cobalt-aluminate) and inverse spinel (i.e., nickel-aluminate) are expected to have different catalytic properties. Thus, the present study with the normal and inverse spinels was conducted to learn whether this was the case. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation Cobalt and nickel aluminate samples were prepared by a coprecipitation method. In a typical experiment Al and Co (or Ni) are coprecipitated from an aqueous nitrate solution by adding an aqueous ammonium carbonate (1 M) solution to produce a pH of about 8. The molar ratio of Al/Co and Al/Ni in the solution for this study was 2.0. The precipitates were collected by filtration, washed and dried at 373 K for 20 h. Portions of the catalyst samples were calcined for 4 h in air at temperatures ranging from 473 to 1173 K. Alumina was prepared from an aqueous aluminium nitrate solution following an experimental procedure similar to that used for the cobalt or nickel containing alumina catalysts. Portions of the alumina were calcined for 4 h in air at temperatures ranging from 473 to 1173 K. 2.2. Catalyst characterization Nitrogen adsorption measurements at 77 K were carried out using a Quantachrome Au- S. Chokkaram et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 121 (1997) 157-169 tosorb 6 instrument. The surface area was calculated using the BET equation [10] and the nitrogen adsorption data. The pore volume was calculated from desorption data assuming a cylindrical pore shape with refinements developed by Broekhoff and deBoer [11] which correct for the adsorbed layer of nitrogen. X-ray diffraction measurements were carried out using a Philips X-ray diffractometer operating at 25 kV, 20 mA, and CuKa radiation (A = 0.15418 nn). The crystal phases of the sample were identified by overlaying the standard ASTM diffraction pattern of an expected compound; a match was based both upon peak position and relative intensity. This process was repeated with several expected compounds which allowed an identification of the various phases present in the sample. Differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of Co and Ni alumina precursors were conducted simultaneously using a Seiko TGA/DTA 320 instrument which is coupled to a VG Micromass quadrupole mass spectrometer. The experiments, unless noted otherwise, were conducted using a helium purge gas (100 mL/min) at a heating rate of 10 K/min. Platinum crucibles were used in all cases, and a-A1203 was used as a reference material. The mass spectrometer was used to conduct `evolved gas analysis' (EGA) concurrently with the simultaneous DTA/TG experiments. 2.3. Catalytic activity measurements In a typical experiment to measure catalytic activity, about 0.5 g (the actual amount was determined for each run) of the sample was diluted with 0.5 g of glass beads (80-100 mesh) and loaded into a tubular, fixed bed reactor where it was held between two quartz wool plugs. A chromel-alumel thermocouple is located near the catalyst bed to monitor the reaction temperature, and to control the temperature. The catalyst was pretreated at 573 K in nitrogen flow for 5 h prior to the reaction. 2-octanol was 159 pumped over the catalyst and the products were collected at intervals during a 6-8 h test period. The liquid hour space velocity (LHSV) of 2-octanol was varied from 0.81 to 15 cc/h. Products were analyzed by gas chromatograph using a DB5 capillary column. 3. Results and discussion The effect of calcination temperature on the structural and catalytic properties of cobaltalumina, nickel-alumina, and alumina catalysts was measured. The data to show the effect of calcination temperature on the BET surface area, pore volume, crystal structure and crystallite size of the coprecipitated Co-Al and Ni-Al catalysts are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. The BET areas of Ni-Al samples decrease from 127 to 94 m2/g as the calcination temperature in- 100 90 80 70 98 0 e 30 44 _._ 14 300 500 700 900 1100 Temperature (K) Fig. 1.

Similarly the BET surface areas for coprecipitated Co-Al catalysts decrease from 156 to 79 M2 /g as the calcination temperature increases from 473 to 1173 K. The pore volume does not depend on the calcination temperature. DTA, DTG and TG-MS results for Co-containing catalyst precursor show an endothermic peak centered at about 538 K (Fig. 1). The DTG results show that the dominant weight loss oc- curs at temperatures between 468 and 538 K. The experimental weight loss obtained from TG data for cobalt-alumina was in the range of 31 wt% and the theoretical weight loss for this sample, assuming it to be Al(OH)3 and Co(OH)2, is 29.4%. Below 468 K, a gradual loss of weight, and the evolution of both H20 and CO2, is observed in Fig. 1. The endotherm and a maximum in the derivation of the weight loss are centered at about 540 K and correspond Table 2 Effect of calcination temperature on the surface area, pore volume and crystal structure of nickel-alumina coprecipitated catalyst Calcination BET surface Pore volume Xphases NiA1204 crystallite temperature (K) area (m 2/g) (cc/g) sizes a ( 473 - - poorly crystalline Ni0 and NiA1204 < 25 673 127 0.20 poorly crystalline Ni0 and NiA1204 < 25 773 115 0.21 poorly crystalline Ni0 and NiA1204 < 25 873 - - poorly crystalline Ni0 and NiA1204 < 28 973 105 0.19 Ni0 and NiA1204 32 (400) 34 (311) 28 (440) 1073 - - Ni0 and NiA1204 47 (400) 63 (311) 63 (440) 1173 94 0.21 Ni0 and NiA1204 79 (400) 86 (311) 95 (440) e Crystallite sizes were calculated using X-ray line broadening technique. S. Chokkaram et al. /Journal of Molecular to the evolution of water (mass 1$) and COZ (mass 44) (Fig. 1). During the endotherm at 540 K, NO (mass 30) is also evolved, and this indicates that the washing did not remove all of the nitrate. Likewise, the evolution of COZ indicates that some C03- (or HCO2-) remained with the catalyst. However, the mass spectroscopic data is qualitative so that a measure of the impurity nitrate and carbonate is not possible. The small endotherm centered at about 650 K, and a small weight loss with the observation of NO evolution, likely corresponds to a crystallization. These events will occur at a higher temperature when the sample is heated at 20o/min than when it is heated for 4 h at a given temperature during the calcination procedure; hence, the temperatures shown for the TGA data (Figs. 1 and 2) and the XRD traces (Figs. 3 and 4) cannot be compared directly, The decomposition of a salt with evolution of 100 3 E 90 0 w soo 18 iii 500 700 900 1100 emperature (K1 1G) Fig. 2.

Thus, whether the observed heat change is endothermic or exothermic will depend upon the balance of these two, or more, events (e.g. [12]}. In any event, the evolution of gas combined with the weight loss clearly indicate that the endothermic peak centered at 540 K is the result of a decomposition reaction. The DTA and TG results for nickel-alumina samples show a series of peaks centered at about 390, 550 and 590 K; however, these peaks are superposed upon a broad endotherm background. For example, water is lost during a temperature range of about 300-?00 K; the rate of maximum water evolution, based on the M.S. data, correspond to the three peaks centered at 390, 550 and 590 K. The loss of COZ becomes noticeable at about 450 K, and 162 S.

The lass of NO attains a maximum rate that corresponds to the 590 K exotherm; this rate is superimposed upon a broad NO lass curve that is centered at about 635 K. The loss of NOZ (mass 46) follows rather closely the second, broad evolution peak for NO. The combination of NOZ with H20 will impact the appearance of NOZ in the M.S. The experimental weight loss far the nickel-aluminum sample is about 42 wt% whereas the theoretical value would be 29% for the decomposition of the nickelaluminum hydroxides. Thus, appears that the nickel-aluminum containing solid contains more nitrate and carbonate than the corresponding cobalt-aluminum solid. The XRD results for the cobalt-alumina catalysts show the presence of a CoA1204 phase at calcination temperatures ranging from 473 to 1173 K (Fig. 3). The 28 values (and lattice plane) corresponding to the major peaks are 31.4 (220), 37 (311) and 65.4 (440) and these S. Chokkaram et al./ Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 121 (1997) 157-169 match closely with the standard CoA1204 phase (ASTM #10-458). The ASTM standard data for cobalt aluminate show that the 311 plane is the most intense (1= 100) followed by 220 (1= 65) and 440 (1= 40) planes. Present experimental results also show that the 311 plane is the most intense (I= 100) followed by 440 (1= 74 to 83) and 220 (1= 21 to 46) planes. The areas (intensities) of the XRD peaks corresponding to the CoA1204 phase increase (inset of Fig. 3) with increasing calcination temperature. The crystallite sizes calculated from XRD linebroadening of the cobalt-alumina samples increase (Table 1) from about 7 to 23 nm as the calcination temperature increases from 473 to 1173 K. The XRD peak areas and crystallite sizes of cobalt-alumina samples show that both the CoA1204 phase content and its crystallite size increase with the calcination temperature. The XRD results also show that the coprecipitation method leads initially (473 K calcination) to the formation of trace quantities of Co203 and Co304 in addition to CoA1204 phase (major). As the calcination temperature increases, the quantity of the CoA1204 phase increases. Chin and Hercules [13] reported the initial formation of Co304 during the calcination of an impregnated Co/A1203 catalyst. X-ray diffraction patterns of nickel-alumina samples show that at low calcination temperatures (Fig. 4) the XRD peaks are broad and these peaks become sharper with an increase in the calcination temperature. The 2 values, corresponding to the three major peaks at 2 B = 37 (311), 45 (400), and 65.6 (440) closely match those expected for the NiA1204 (ASTM # 10339) phase. However, the relative intensities of these peaks do not match exactly the ASTM standard. For example, the ASTM standard data of nickel-aluminate show that the 311 plane is the most intense (I= 100) followed by 400 plane (1= 65) and 440 plane (I = 60). However, for the present results, the 440 plane is the most intense (1= 100) followed by the 400 plane (I = 71 to 84) and the 311 plane (1= 46 to 81). The discrepancies in the relative intensi- 163 ties of these peaks may be due to the presence of impurities, such as nickel oxide, and/or preferred growth in certain crystal directions. The XRD patterns of nickel-alumina samples from the present study do not show well defined peaks corresponding to the nickel oxide phase. The area under the XRD peak is often considered to represent the integrated intensity of the peak. For most of the metal oxides the integrated intensity of a particular XRD peak is proportional to the amount of phase corresponding to that peak. The XRD results from the present study show that the areas under the three major peaks (corresponding to 311, 400 and 440 planes) remain almost constant throughout the calcination temperature range of 673 to 1173 K (inset of Fig. 4). These results clearly show that the nickel-alumina samples contain almost equal amount of nickelaluminate phase irrespective of their calcination temperature; they differ only with respect to crystallinity. This is further illustrated by the crystallite size which increases from 2.5 to 9.5 nm as the calcination temperature increases from 473 to 1173 K (Table 2). The crystallite sizes obtained from this study (from the X-ray diffraction pattern (Fig. 3) and crystallite size data (Table 2)) are inconsistent with the results reported by Lansink et al. [14]. The NiA1204 particles obtained below 973 K calcination temperatures in the present study are considerably smaller than reported by Lansink et al. [14]. The XRD pattern for the dried nickelaluminum containing material has three very broad and low intensity peaks that have 2 0 values in the regions of the three major peaks for NiA1204; however, the peak maxima positions do not have the exact 2 0 values for NiA1204. The XRD pattern for the cobaltaluminum material exhibits low intensity, broad peaks that could be due to very small crystalline CoA1,,04. Superimposed upon these broad peaks are a few sharp low intensity peaks that we have not been able to identify using the ASTM reference data. The specific surface area of a cube or sphere l S. Chokkaram et al. j Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 121 (1997)157-1 is related [ 15,1 to the edge or diameter of the particle by the equation S = (6 j pD)(1 /F) where S is the surface area, p is the density, D is the edge or diameter, and 1 /F is the packing factor [15] to correct for surface contact points that are unavailable for nitrogen adsorption. The log(surface area, M2/g) versus log(crystallite, nm) plots (Fig. 5) for Co-Al and Ni-Al samples yield packing factor (1 jF) values of 0.70 and 0.25, respectively. The assumption made by Allred et al. [ 15] for the correction of unavailable surface area is based on spherical particles. Deviations in the experimentally determined packing factor values can be associated with the irregular shape of particles. In the present study of cobalt-alumina and nickel-alumina systems, the packing factor value for cobalt-alumina samples is near to the one usually observed (i.e., 0.7) but the packing factor is far from unity (i.e., 0.25) for nickel-alumina material. These results suggest that the nickel-alumina particles may be very irregular in shape. Analysis of the nickel-alumina sample (calcined at 1173 K) by SEM-EDAX showed that the particles are irregular in shape, and have an Al jNi ratio approximately 2.0, as expected, and at the resolution of the instrument, have a uniform distribution of Ni and Al.

The selectivity for one of the product(s), X;, is denoted as SX. (where X; stands for dehydration products (III + VI), octenes (HO, ethers (VI) and dehydrogenation (VIII) product) which is defined as: amount of X i formed X 100 SXj conversion of 2-octanal. Similarly, the octene distribution, which represents the selectivity for one octene among the actene products, is deigned as S' (amount of one of the octene formed X 100) total actenes formed. Results for the conversion of 2-octanol over alumina, cobalt-alumina, and nickel-alumina catalysts are presented in Tables 3-7. The selectivity for dehydrogenation, dehydration, and isamerization depend on the type of catalyst, LHSV, catalyst calcination temperature and the reaction temperature. The selectivities for 1-actene, cis-2-octene, and traps-2-octene among the octenes (Tables 3-6) depend mostly on the type of catalyst, LHSV and reaction temperature. The data for 2-octanol conversion aver a1umina, cobalt-alumina and nickel-alumina catalysts show a linear relationship between conversion and the reciprocal LHSV (Figs. 6 and 7) up to conversions of about 50%a. Thus, the 2-octanol conversion over these catalysts follows zero order kinetics in the conversion range of 0 to 50% but, at higher conversions, there is a S.

The temperature dependency of 2-actanol over alumina, nickel-alumina and cobaltalumina is shown in Fig. 8 in the form of Arrhens plots (ln(conversion) versus 1/T). The data were well fitted with a regression coefficient of above 0.95. The activation energies (Table 7) calculated from these Arrhenius plots (Fig. 8) vary from 16 to 31 kcal jmol for the conversion of 2-octanol, 17-31 kcal/rnol for the dehydration of 2-octanol and 10-25 kcal/mol for the dehydration of 2-octanol to ethers (T= 493-533 K). The activation energy values obtained in the present study are consistent with the results reported for earlier studies [20,22-24]. For example, an activation energy value of 32.2 kcal jmol was reported for the dehydration of 2-octanol over yttria catalysts in the reaction temperature range of 513 to 618 K [22].

The selectivity of 1-octene falls in the range of 38 to 48% for all the three catalysts for these two calcination temperatures. The selectivity for 1-octene decreases with increasing reaction temperature (Tables 3-6) for the three catalysts. Alumina and cobalt-alumina produce very little, if any, dehydrogenation of 2-octanol. The selectivity for dehydrogenation for the nickelalumina calcined at 673 K is about 40% and this selectivity decreases to about 22% as the calcination temperature of nickel-alumina catalyst increases to 1173 K. It is likely that the dehydrogenation activity is due, in part or completely, to the presence of Ni oxide impurities.

Conclusions The introduction of cobalt or nickel into aiumina may lead to different types of materials such as the formation of spinet compound or segregation of oxide phase or a mixture depending on the experimental conditions. The crystallinity of the spinet depends on the calcination temperature and increases with the increase of calcination temperature. The results for 2-octanol conversion suggest that nickel-alumina coprecipitated catalysts have both dehydration and dehydrogenation activity. The dehydrogenation selectivity de- S. Chokkaram et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 121 (1997) 157-169 creases, and the dehydration selectivity increases, with calcination temperature of the catalyst precursor. The activity of the cobaltalumina catalysts is greater than that of the nickel-alumina catalysts. The octene distributions (1-octene, cis- and trans-2-octene) are essentially the same for alumina, nickel-alumina and cobalt-alumina catalysts at a reaction temperature of 523 K. The selectivity for 1-octene decreases with reaction temperature for the catalysts. The major difference among the catalyst series is lower activity and dehydration selectivity for the nickelalumina catalysts compared to alumina and cobalt-alumina catalysts. The differences are more pronounced at lower reaction and lower calcination temperatures. The present data show that both the inverse (N'A1204) and normal (CoA1204) spinel compounds are active for 2octanol conversion and that both resemble alumina. Thus, it appears that A13+ in either tetrahedral or octahedral sites exhibit similar sites for 2-octanol conversion and this leads to similar product selectivities as well as showing that the alumina catalyst sites are not altered by the substitution of Co or Ni ions.

Structural characterization of CoAl and NiAl coprecipitated catalysts has been accomplished using techniques such as X-ray diffraction, DTA, TGA, TG-MS, BET surface area and pore volume. The catalyst samples were prepared by coprecipitation of cobalt (or nickel) and aluminum from their aqueous salt solutions. The interaction of Co (or Ni) with aluminum has been investigated by X-ray diffraction as a function of calcination temperature. The results indicate that the interaction between Co and Al can lead to the formation of a normal spinel of CoAl2O4 at a very low temperature such as 473 K. On the other hand the interaction between Ni and Al is not sufficient to form well crystallized NiAl2O4 species at low temperatures but nickel-aluminate formation was seen above 973 K. The activity and selectivity of these catalysts for 2-octanol conversion are dependent on the reaction temperature, liquid hour space velocity (LHSV) as well as on the calcination temperature. The dehydrogenation activity of nickel based catalysts is attributed to the presence of nickel oxide whereas the dehydration activity is due to the spinel phase. The differences in the dehydration activity between alumina and nickel-alumina is mostly because of the incomplete formation of spinel phase (i.e., low temperature calcined samples). Catalytic activity of cobalt-alumina catalysts is comparable with that of alumina catalysts towards 2-octanol conversion.

The dehydrogenation activity of nickel based catalysts is attributed to the presence of nickel oxide whereas the dehydration activity is due to the spinel phase. The differences in the dehydration activity between alumina and nickel-alumina is mostly because of the incomplete formation of spinel phase (i.e., low temperature calcined samples). Catalytic activity of cobalt-alumina catalysts is comparable with that of alumina catalysts towards 2-octanol conversion.",
