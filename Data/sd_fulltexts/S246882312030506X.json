Graphical abstract In this work, N-doped porous carbon stabilized CuxO (Cu-NPCs) were synthesized by a one-pot method using copper nitrate as copper precursor with the aid of Pluronic F127 under acidic condition. The characterization results confirmed that CuxO species (CuO and Cu2O) existed in NPC in a highly dispersed state due to the strong interaction between CuxO and the doped N atoms. The obtained Cu-NPCs were used as supports to prepare Au catalysts for glycerol (GLY) oxidation to dihydroxyacetone (DHA) under base-free conditions. During the reaction, GLY preferentially adsorbed onto Au nanoparticles via the secondary OH groups due to the porous characteristics of the supports, the enhanced surface basicity from the N functionalities accelerates the alkoxide formation by abstracting proton from GLY, and the surface Cu+ sites instead of Au nanoparticles activate O2 molecules to produce active oxygen species, as a result, Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-H, which is the best catalyst in Au/Cu-NPCs, exhibited much higher catalytic activity and selectivity than those of Au/CuO. Moreover, due to the stabilization of CuxO species by NPC, relatively stable surface Cu+ content, and the strong interaction between Au nanoparticles and the supports, Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-H also possessed much better catalytic stability than that of Au/CuO during four consecutive catalytic runs. Keywords Glycerol oxidation Dihydroxyacetone Au catalysts CuxO N-doped porous carbon 1 Introduction The catalytic conversion of GLY to useful chemicals has been received considerate attention in recent years because it is essential for the commercial viability of biodiesel production. [1–5]Many processes have been developed to transform GLY to different value-added chemicals for different applications, for example, very recently, Oliveira, et al. used synthetic silica as a metal-free catalyst to convert waste GLY to formic acid. Yan, et al. presented an excellent work on one-step conversion of GLY into alanine over a Ru1Ni7/MgO catalyst. [6–16] Among these process, selective oxidation has been studied widely to produce various valuable oxygenated derivatives, such as glyceric acid (GLA), DHA, lactic acid (LA), glycolic acid (GCA), and tartronic acid (TA), etc [17–20]. In particular, DHA is a high value-added fine chemical, which is mainly used as a sunless tanning agent in the cosmetics industry and chemical intermediate in organic synthesis [1,21]. Nevertheless, because GLY oxidation mainly produce GLA rather than DHA, especially under base conditions, selective oxidation of GLY to DHA with high selectivity still remains a grand challenge. In early stage of the research on GLY oxidation to DHA, researchers focused on using Pt or Pd catalysts to oxidize GLY to produce DHA under base-free conditions, for example, by alloying Pt or Pd with a second metal, supported Pt-Bi and Pt-Sb catalysts were found active for this reaction under acidic condition, and Pd-Ag/C catalysts can achieve 52 % of GLY conversion with DHA yield of 44 % under neutral condition. [18,21–25]However, Pt and Pd based catalysts are easily suffered deactivation due to poisoning by oxygen [26]. Thus, selective oxidation of GLY over supported Au catalysts have become the alternative way to produce DHA because Au catalysts are more resistant to oxygen poisoning, permitting the use of high oxygen partial pressures [3]. Au catalysts initially were believed to be only active in basic medium and GLA is the primary product [27]. However, Liu, et al. recently prepared a series of metal oxide (Al2O3, TiO2, CuO, NiO, and ZrO2) supported Au catalysts and found that Au/CuO exhibited best catalytic performance on the oxidation of GLY to DHA under base-free conditions, up to 80 % of DHA yield can be achieved at optimized conditions. [28] This work demonstrated that DHA could be the primary product in the oxidation of GLY over Au catalysts under base-free conditions when a suitable metal oxide was selected as the support. Ke, et al. also prepared a series of Au catalysts supported on metallic oxides, i.e., ZnO, CuO, Al2O3, Fe2O3, and NiO for selective oxidation of GLY to DHA under base-free conditions and confirmed once again that Au/CuO was the best catalyst among these catalysts. However, Au/CuO and Au/ZnO were remarkably deactivated during the recycling due to the aggregation of Au particles and carbon deposition. [29] Wang, et al. further improved the catalytic performance of Au/CuO in this reaction by mixing CuO support with a certain amount of ZrO2 and concluded that the small particle size of Au, the large content of Au° and an appropriate amount of basic sites could promote the glycerol conversion to DHA. [30] On the other hand, Prati et al. used carbon nanofibers supported Au catalysts for the oxidation of glycerol under base-free conditions and found that the N-containing groups improved the basic properties of the support, which accelerates the alkoxide formation by abstracting proton from GLY, thus leading to the enhancement of the catalytic activity of Au catalysts [31]. Rodrigues, et al. demonstrated that Au nanoparticles supported on multi-walled carbon nanotubes and carbon xerogels can oxidize GLY to produce formic acid with high selectivity under basic conditions. The authors proposed that the porous characteristic of the supports promoted the initial formation of DHA, which require the binding of GLY molecules on the catalyst in a conformation that needs more space, then formic acid was produced via the degradation of DHA under highly basic medium. [32–35] Given all the above, if Au nanoparticles can be supported on the large surface area porous copper oxide with enhanced surface basicity, there is a possibility increasing the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability of Au catalysts for oxidation of GLY to DHA under base-free conditions. Recently, many studies also found the CuxO/carbon nanocomposites were excellent catalysts for many catalytic oxidation reactions, such as CO oxidation, oxidation of diphenylmethane, and Hg0 oxidation, because the highly dispersed CuxO species were very stable by the protection of porous carbon, which also facilitate the efficient diffusion of reactants. [36–38] Thus, in this work, highly dispersed CuxO stabilized by N-doped porous carbon materials were first prepared by a one-pot method and then used as supports for Au catalysts. The obtained Au catalysts were characterized by various techniques and their catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability were evaluated and compared with those of Au/CuO in the oxidation of GLY to DHA under base-free conditions. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The resol precursor was first prepared according to the procedure in the literature [39]. NPC with highly dispersed CuxO (Cu-NPCs) were synthesized by a modified procedure based on the previous work. [20,40] Briefly, 1.0 g F127 and 2.0 g of dicyandiamide (DCDA) were first dissolved in a mixture of ethanol (20.0 g) and water (10.0 g), then a certain amount of copper nitrate and 5.0 g of resol ethanol solution (20 wt %) were added to the above solution, and the pH value was adjusted to 1.0 by the addition of concentrated HNO3. After stirring for 0.5 h, the final solution was put into a drying oven and underwent solvent evaporation at 50 °C for 6 h, followed by 100 °C for 24 h. the obtained composites were calcined in a tubular furnace under N2 atmosphere at 350 °C for 3 h with a heating rate of 1 °C min−1and then 600 °C for 3 h with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1. The resulting samples are designated as Cu-NPC-X, where X is the weight percentage of copper nitrate to F127, DCDA and resol. NPC are also prepared according to the above method. Supported Au catalysts with 1 wt % of Au loading were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of NPC or Cu-NPCs (Cu-NPC-5%, Cu-NPC-15 %, and Cu-NPC-30 %) with HAuCl4⚫3H2O aqueous solution of the required concentration according to the previous studies. [41,42]The obtained catalysts were dried in an oven at 120 °C overnight and calcined under static air at 200 °C for 3 h. For the purpose of comparison, CuO was synthesized by the precipitation method, and then used as the support to prepare Au/CuO catalyst by deposition-precipitation method following the procedures in reported work [28,29,43]. 2.2 Catalyst characterization The contents of C, N, H and O in various carbon samples were determined using a PerkinElmer 2400 Series-II CHN/O Elemental Analyzer. The contents of Au and Cu were measured on an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (Thermo Fisher iCAP7600 series). TEM images were recorded by using a FEI TecnaiG2 F20 S-Twin or Thermo Scientific Talos F2100 × . Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed with a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.5418 Å) at 40 kV and 40 mA. XPS spectra were measured on a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi by using an Al Kα radiation source. The binding energy was calibrated by taking the C 1s peak (BE = 284.8 eV) as a reference. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were obtained by using Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument at −196 °C. The samples were degassed under vacuum for 12 h at 150 °C before analysis. In situ CO FTIR spectroscopy was carried out on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet 6700 Fourier transform IR spectrometer equipped with a high-temperature/high-pressure chamber and a MCT detector. The resolution of the spectrometer was 4 cm−1 by 64 scans. Before the analysis, the catalysts were pretreated with a flow (30 mL/min) of He gas (99.99 %) at 120 °C (heating rate 5 °C/min) for 1 h. After the temperature was cooled down to 25 °C, a background spectrum was collected, and then the catalysts were exposed to a flow of CO gas (99.9 %, 30 mL min−1) at 25 °C for 0.5 h. subsequently, the catalysts were purged with a flow of He gas (30 mL/min) for 5 min., then the IR spectra were collected. [44] CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) was performed by using Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 Chemisorption Analyzer. The samples (≈50 mg) were placed in a U-type quartz cell and pretreated in He flow at 800 °C for 1 h, and then the sample was cooled to 50 °C in flowing He. CO2 was introduced and allowed to adsorb at 50 °C for 1 h. The sample was then purged with helium gas at the same temperature to remove weakly adsorbed CO2. Finally, the sample was heated at a linear rate of 10 °C/min under helium gas to 700 °C. 2.3 Catalytic activity evaluation GLY oxidation reactions were carried out in a 50 mL stainless steel microreactor equipped with a magnetic stirrer. Typically, 25 mL of 0.3 mol/L GLY aqueous solution and a certain amount of catalyst (glycerol/Au metal =250 mol/mol) were added into the reactor, which was then pressurized to the O2 pressure of 0.5 MPa after purging with O2 (99.99 %) three times. After 4 h reaction time at 60 °C, the catalysts were removed by filtration, and the liquid products were analyzed by using HPLC equipped with an Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad Laboratories), ultraviolet (210 nm) and refractive index (RI) detector. The analysis conditions were set as follows: eluent, 5 mM H2SO4; flow rate, 0.6 mL/min; column temperature, 50 °C. The gas products were collected using gas collecting bags and detected on a GC-TCD detector equipped with a Porapak Q column. For quantification, an external calibration method was used (Figure S1). For the calculation of TOF, TOF is defined as the amount of glycerol reacted per hour per surface Au site. The Au dispersion (D) was derived from particle size (d) via D = 1.3/d. [45] 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst characterization NPC with highly dispersed CuxO were prepared by the one-pot method using copper nitrate as copper precursors and Pluronic F127 as porogen under acidic condition. As shown in Fig. 1 , the isotherms of NPC, Cu-NPC-5%, Cu-NPC-15 %, and Cu-NPC-30 % exhibit type IV curves with an H1-type hysteresis loop, which is the characteristic of typical mesoporous materials. The inserted image in Fig. 1 shows that the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distributions derived from the desorption branches, which are centered at around 3.7 nm, become broader and weaker with the increase of Cu(NO3)2 loading, which indicating that the ordered mesoporous structure was collapsed due to the acidic condition and the addition of Cu(NO3)2 during the preparation. The detailed pore parameters and chemical compositions of all the samples are listed in Table S1. It can be seen that the BET surface area of NPC is 512.1 m2/g, then decreases to 468.5 m2/g, 364.1 m2/g and 207.4 m2/g in Cu-NPC-5%, Cu-NPC-15 %, and Cu-NPC-30 %, respectively, with the increase of the Cu(NO3)2 loading from 5% to 30 %. ICP-OES analyses in Table S1 confirm that the copper is successfully retained in NPC and the contents are 4.64 wt%, 12.86 wt%, and 21.71 wt% for Cu-NPC-5%, Cu-NPC-15 %, and Cu-NPC-30 %, respectively. XPS quantitative analysis in Table S1 indicates that the N content is as high as 12.94 % in NPC and the Cu contents are 1.48 at%, 4.62 at%, and 10.74 at% in Cu-NPC-5%, Cu-NPC-15 %, and Cu-NPC-30 %, respectively. In addition, as listed in Table S1, when 5 % of Cu(NO3)2 is introduced into NPC, the mesopore volume of Cu-NPC-5% remains almost the same as that of NPC, then it slightly decreases from 0.197 cm3/g to 0.184 cm3/g when the Cu(NO3)2 loading increases from 5 % to 15 %, further increasing the Cu(NO3)2 loading to 30 %, the mesopore volume drops to 0.076 cm3/g for Cu-NPC-30 %. However, for the micropore volume, it linearly declines from 0.148 cm3/g to 0.049 cm3/g with the increase of the Cu(NO3)2 loading from 0 to 30 %. The results probably implied that Cu species first occupy the micropores, then the mesopores with the addition of Cu(NO3)2. NPC, Cu-NPC-5%, Cu-NPC-15 %, and Cu-NPC-30 % supported Au catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method and Au/CuO was also prepared by deposition-precipitation method as the reference. The Au loadings measured by the ICP technique for all the catalysts in Table S2 were around 1 %, which were in accordance with the theoretical loadings. Their XRD patterns in Fig. 2 do not exhibit any diffraction peaks corresponding to Au nanoparticles, implying that Au particle size is too small to be detected. Furthermore, when the loading of Cu(NO3)2 is less than 15 %, no diffraction peaks attributing to any copper species can be found, probably indicating that copper species were presented in NPC in a highly dispersed state in Au/Cu-NPC-5% and Au/Cu-NPC-15 %. However, the XRD pattern of Au/Cu-NPC-30 % exhibits diffraction peaks due to cubic Cu (JCPDS 04−0836), monoclinic CuO (JCPDS 48–1548) and cubic Cu2O phases (JCPDS 05−0667), probably suggesting that if the Cu(NO3)2 loading is higher than a certain value, copper species were aggregated into Cu/CuxO particles. TEM images of Au/CuO, Au/NPC, Au/Cu-NPC-5%, Au/Cu-NPC-15 % and Au/Cu-NPC-30 % in Fig. 3 and Figure S2 indicate that Au nanoparticles are well dispersed on all the supports and their mean particle sizes are 3.57 ± 0.93 nm, 2.38 ± 0.47 nm, 2.78 ± 0.85 nm, 3.45 ± 0.91 nm and 4.70 ± 1.84 nm, respectively. The most uniform and smallest size of Au nanoparticles on NPC support could be due to the strong metal-support interactions between the Au and N functionalities which can promote the effective immobilization of the Au nanoparticles. [46,47] When Cu(NO3)2 was added to this one pot synthesis, possibly because the addition of Cu species into NPC weakened the strong Au-support interaction, Au nanoparticles grow gradually with the increase of the Cu(NO3)2 loading. The STEM-EDX elemental mapping in Fig. 4 reveals that Cu species are well distributed in Cu-NPC-15 %, while copper species were aggregated into very big particles on the surface of Cu-NPC-30 %, as shown in Figure S3. In addition, high resolution TEM images in Figure S4 shows that only the lattice spacing of 0.235 nm, which corresponds to the (111) planes of cubic Au, can be resolved in Au/Cu-NPC-5% and Au/Cu-NPC-15 %, while (111) planes of cubic Cu (0.208 nm) and (11−1) planes of monoclinic CuO (0.252 nm) were also observed in Au/Cu-NPC-30 % except for the (111) planes of cubic Au. High resolution XPS measurements were conducted to further understand the chemical states of various elements in Au/Cu-NPCs. As shown in Fig. 5 (a), two contributions can be observed at around 934.5 and 932.2 eV in Au/Cu-NPC-5%, Au/Cu-NPC-15 %, and Au/Cu-NPC-30 %. The peak with binding energy higher than 933 eV can be assigned to Cu2+, the other peak with binding energy lower than 933 eV can be assigned to the Cu+/Cu° species. [48] Since the binding energies of Cu+ and Cu° are almost identical in Cu 2p spectra, Cu LMM Auger electron spectra were used to distinguish them on these catalysts. [49] The results in the inserted image show that three peaks can be deconvoluted at around 916.2 eV, 917.9 eV and 912.1 eV in the spectra of Au/Cu-NPC-5% and Au/Cu-NPC-15 %, which could be due to Cu+, Cu2+ and other orbital electrons, respectively. [50–52] As for Au/Cu-NPC-30 %, one more peak at 918.9 eV due to Cu° can be observed, thus Cu°, Cu+, and Cu2+ are present on the surface of Au/Cu-NPC-30 %, which is consistent with the XRD results. [51,52] Fig. 5 (b) shows the XPS N 1s spectrum for Au/NPC can be curve-fitted into three components located at around 398.6, 400.3, and 401.3 eV, which correspond to pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, and graphitic N, respectively. [20] When Cu species existed in the NPC support, previous studies reported that Cu-N bonds could be formed, whose XPS peak is located at around 397 or 399 eV [53,54]. However, in this work, only the peaks due to pyridinic N and pyrrolic N shifted to the lower binding energies with the increase of Cu(NO3)2 loading. The shift probably implies copper species interact strongly with pyridinic N and pyrrolic N atoms in the NPC support. In Fig. 5 (a), the banding energies for Cu+ and Cu2+ in Au/Cu-NPC-5% shift to the higher binding energies with the increase of Cu(NO3)2 loading, further confirming the strong interaction between Cu species and N atoms. In addition, the O 1s spectrum of Au/NPC in Fig. 5 (c) can be also deconvoluted into three components locating at 531.1, 532.3, and 533.5, which can be assigned to oxygen atoms in carbonyl groups, oxygen atoms in hydroxyl or ethers, and oxygen in anhydride, lactone, or carboxylic acids, respectively. [55] When copper species were introduced into the NPC support, a new peak at around 530.3 eV appears in all the spectra of Au/Cu-NPCs, which is characteristic of oxygen in a metal oxide such as Cu2O or CuO according to a previous study. [36] Based on the above analysis, Cu species existed as their oxidized states (CuO and Cu2O) in NPC framework in a highly dispersed state due to the strong interaction between Cu and N functionalities (pyridinic N and pyrrolic N), when the loading of Cu(NO3)2 is less than 15 %. Nevertheless, for Au/Cu-NPC-30 %, probably because the NPC support do not have enough content of N atoms to interact with Cu species, excess Cu species were aggregated into large particles of Cu/Cu2O/CuO on the surface of Au/Cu-NPC-30 %, as demonstrated in the above XRD, XPS and TEM measurements. Au 4f spectra were also shown in Fig. 5 (d), for Au/NPC, the peak at 83.7 eV can be assigned to Au°, and no oxidized Au species were found on the surface of Au/NPC, when Au nanoparticles were supported on CuO, two peaks can be deconvoluted at 84.0 and 84.8 eV, the first one is due to Au°, the other can be assigned to Auδ +, which is normally located at the interfaces of gold and copper oxide due to the formation of Au-O bond with the copper oxide, and the surface fraction of Auδ +/Au is 30.2 %. [56] The binding energy of the peak due to Au° in Au/NPC is much lower than that in Au/CuO, probably because Au nanoparticles in Au/NPC preferentially interact with the electron donating nitrogen species, pyrrolic N atoms in NPC, which can donate its electron to Au, leading to the electron enrichment of the Au nanoparticles [46,47]. When Au nanoparticles are supported on Cu-NPCs, the peak due to Au° gradually shifts back to 84.0 eV with the increase of Cu content on the NPC surface, and the surface fraction of Auδ +/Au are 11.7 %, 20.4 % and 19.7 % on the surfaces of Au/Cu-NPC-5%, Au/Cu-NPC-15 %, and Au/Cu-NPC-30 %, respectively, suggesting the Au nanoparticles mainly interact with CuxO species rather than pyrrolic N atoms in Cu-NPC supports. Since the enhanced surface basicity on the support can improve the catalytic activity of Au catalysts for GLY oxidation to DHA under base-free conditions. [29,30]CO2-TPD was conducted to evaluate the surface basicity of Au/CuO, Au/NPC, and Au/Cu-NPCs. As shown in Fig. 6 , Au/CuO exhibited a very weak desorption peak at around 90 °C, while Au/NPC showed a strong desorption peak at 110 °C, which could be derived from N functionalities. With the increase of the Cu(NO3)2 loading from 5 % to 30 %, the desorption peak due to N functionalities became weaker and shifted to higher temperature gradually, probably suggesting the interaction between N functionalities and CuxO species reduced the surface basicity of the supports. Nevertheless, Fig. 6 and the amount of basic sites measured for all the Au catalysts listed in Table S3 indicated that the surface basicity of Au/Cu-NPCs is still much higher than that of Au/CuO. The in situ CO FTIR measurements are carried out to investigate the exposed surface sites on Au/CuO, Au/Cu-NPC-5%, Au/Cu-NPC-15 % and Au/Cu-NPC-30 % and the results were shown in Fig. 7 . For Au/CuO, three adsorption bands at 2143 cm−1, 2123 cm−1 and 2101 cm−1 can be observed, which can be assigned to linearly CO adsorbed on the Auδ +, Cu+ and Au° sites, respectively, based on the previous IR studies of CO adsorption on the metal oxides supported Au catalysts.52, [57–59] The appearance of the band due to CO adsorption on Cu+ is because Cu2+ can be reduced to Cu+ by CO at room temperature. [60] When Au nanoparticles were supported on Cu-NPC-5%, the adsorption band due to CO adsorption on Cu+ sites shifted to 2111 cm−1, which can be attributed to the strong interaction between CuxO species and NPC, in turn weakening the CO bond. [61] In addition, the band due to Auδ + slightly shifted to 2146 cm−1 and the band intensity reduced with the decline of the surface Auδ +/Au fraction. With the increase of the Cu(NO3)2 loading to 15 %, the bands due to CO adsorptions on Cu+ sites and Auδ + became stronger because the surface content of Cu+ and Auδ +/Au fraction increased according to the XPS measurements. As for Au/Cu-NPC-30 %, based on its XPS and XRD measurements, part of Cu species is Cu° on catalyst surface, thus the additional strong adsorption band at 2094 cm−1 could be attributed to CO adsorption on Cu°, which is also consistent with a previous study. [62] 3.2 Catalytic activity evaluation The catalytic performances of Au/NPC, Au/CuO, Au/NPC, Au/Cu-NPC-5%, Au/Cu-NPC-15 % and Au/Cu-NPC-30 % in GLY oxidation are evaluated under base-free conditions. It can be seen in Table 1 that although the catalytic activity of Au/NPC is very low, the selectivity to DHA is much higher than that to GLA, which could be due to the small size of Au nanoparticles, the porous characteristics of NPC, and the surface basicity derived from N functionalities. When the support is changed to CuO, Au/CuO exhibited much higher catalytic activity and selectivity than those of Au/NPC, approximately 36.6 % of glycerol conversion with 81.6 % selectivity to DHA can be achieved at 60 °C with 0.5 MPa of O2 pressure within 4 h. This result clearly suggested that Au catalysts can be very active for GLY oxidation to DHA under base-free conditions when CuO was used as the catalyst support. In addition, the turnover frequency (TOF) over Au/NPC and Au/CuO, which calculated from the GLY consumption rate divided by moles of surface Au atoms at low conversion (Table S4) of GLY, are about 7.1 h−1 and 92.0 h−1, respectively. When 5 % of Cu(NO3)2 was added into NPC, compared to Au/NPC, the GLY conversion and selectivity to DHA drastically increase to 32.1 % and 84.1 %, respectively, even though the surface content of Cu species (CuO and Cu2O) in the support is only 1.48 at%. Further increasing the loading of Cu(NO3)2 to 15 %, the GLY conversion and DHA selectivity increased to 57.3 % and 91.8 %, respectively. In the meantime, the TOF was greatly improved from 69.6 h−1 to 155.2 h−1, which is also much higher than that over Au/CuO. Considering the mean sizes of Au nanoparticles in Au/CuO and Au/Cu-NPC-15 % are almost identical, the higher catalytic performance of Au/Cu-NPC-15 % than that of Au/CuO suggests that the combination of N-doped mesoporous carbon materials and CuxO in the support can promote the GLY conversion and DHA selectivity over Au catalysts. As for Au/Cu-NPC-30 %, the GLY conversion and DHA selectivity rapidly dropped to 29.6 % and 77.3 %, respectively, probably because of its low BET surface area, large Au nanoparticles, and high Cu° content. From the in situ CO FTIR spectra in Fig. 7, it can be seen that the adsorption band due to CO-Cu+ is weak on Au/CuO and Au/Cu-NPC-5%, while the intensity of this band is strongest in Au/Cu-NPC-15 % among all the catalysts, which also showed the highest catalytic activity and selectivity. Yin, et al. recently reported that the Cu+ sites in CuMgAl-hydrotalcite-supported Au catalysts promoted the selectivity to DHA, and the basic sites boosted the catalytic activity in the oxidation of glycerol under base-free conditions. [63] Thus, the presence of the surface Cu+ species could be one of the reasons responsible for the high catalytic performance of Au/Cu-NPC-15 %. In order to confirm it, Au/Cu-NPC-15 % was treated by 10 % H2 in Ar at 200 °C for 10 min. (denoted as Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-H) to reduce the Cu2+ species to increase the surface content of Cu+ species. It can be seen from Table S2 and Figure S5-S8 that Cu species on these two catalysts are still Cu2+ and Cu+ on Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-H and the texture properties, XRD pattern and the size of Au nanoparticles for Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-H remained almost unchanged after H2 treatment. The only difference is that the surface Cu+ contents increased 1.91 at% on Au/Cu-NPC-15 % to 2.38 at% on Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-H, as listed in Table S3. As a result, the GLY conversion and DHA selectivity over Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-H further increase to 65.6 % and 92.1 %, respectively. Based on the catalytic activity evaluation and surface Cu+ content results, it can be found that the catalytic activity and selectivity improves with the increase of surface Cu+ content from 0.45 at%, 1.91 at%, then to 2.38 at% for Au/Cu-NPC-5%, Au/Cu-NPC-15 %, and Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-H, respectively. As for Au/Cu-NPC-30 %, which has highest surface Cu+ content, its low catalytic activity and selectivity could be due to the large size of Au nanoparticles, low surface area and high content of Cu°. The effect of reaction time on GLY oxidation was investigated over Au/CuO and Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-H. It can be seen in Fig. 8 (a) that with prolonging reaction time, the GLY conversion increased to 36.6 % within 4 h reaction time over Au/CuO, after that, no further increase can be observed, while the DHA selectivity first increases from 60.9 % to 81.9 % in the first 3 h reaction time, then decreases after 4 h reaction time. As for Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-H in Fig. 8 (b), the GLY conversion reached the maximum at 74.1 % at 6 h of reaction time, but the DHA selectivity declines gradually from 96.3 % at 1 h to 82.5 % at 8 h reaction time. It is probably suggested that the terminal −OH in GLY molecules can be activated on Au/CuO, leading to the formation of GLA, GCA or OA, while on Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-H, DHA is the only product in the first oxidation step, and GLA, GCA or OA are the products from secondary oxidation of DHA. The effects of reaction temperature and O2 pressure were also studied over Au/CuO and Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-H. As shown in Fig. 9 (a), the GLY conversions over both Au/CuO and Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-H increase with the elevation of reaction temperature from 40 °C to 80 °C. Further raising the reaction temperature, almost no further increase can be observed over these two catalysts. While the DHA selectivity over both Au/CuO and Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-H drops with the increase of the reaction temperature, because high reaction temperature promotes the secondary oxidation of DHA over Au catalysts. In Fig. 9 (b), it can be seen that the O2 pressure do not influence much the DHA selectivities in the range from 0.1 to 1 MPa over both Au/CuO and Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-H. Nevertheless, the GLY conversions display different trend over these two catalysts with the change of the O2 pressure, the GLY conversion over Au/CuO remain relatively stable within the O2 pressure ranged from 0.1 MPa to 1.0 MPa, while the GLY conversion over Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-H increases with O2 pressure from 0.1 MPa to 0.5 MPa, probably suggesting the O2 involved in this catalytic reaction in different ways over Au/CuO and Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-H. According to the reaction mechanism for GLY oxidation to DHA on Au/CuO under base-free conditions proposed by Ke, et al., Au nanoparticles acted as the catalytic center where GLY molecules were adsorbed dissociatively to generate metal alkoxide intermediates, while the Au-CuO perimeter provided the lattice oxygens to participate in the reaction. [29] Thus, the catalytic performance of Au/CuO could be understood in term of the synergy between Au nanoparticles and Au-CuO interfaces, which is also evidenced by two absorption bands due to CO-Au° and CO-Auδ + in in-situ CO FTIR spectra of Au/CuO. However, for Au/Cu-NPC-15 % or Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-H, the surface Cu+ species play an important role for their high catalytic performance. Liu, et al. reported that the spinel MgCuCr2O4 supported Au catalysts are highly active and selective for ethanol oxidation and proposed that the Cu+ sites rather than Au nanoparticles can activate O2 [64,65]. Thus, in this work, we propose in Figure S9 that, the secondary OH groups in GLY are more preferentially adsorbed onto the Au nanoparticles on Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-H than those on Au/CuO, due to the porous characteristics of the support, then the enhanced surface basicity accelerates the alkoxide formation by abstracting proton from GLY adsorbed on Au under base-free condition, which was considered as the most difficult step in alcohol and GLY oxidation. [64,66] In the meantime, the surface Cu+ species activate O2 molecules instead of Au nanoparticles to produce active oxygen species (O− or O2-), which also facilitate the cleavage of OH bond of GLY to form metal alkoxide intermediates. This could be the reason why higher content of surface Cu+ species or higher pressure of O2 leads to higher catalytic activity and selectivity. Subsequently the dissociated hydrogen will be bonded to the surface oxidized Cu2+ species to produce surface OH, and then ketones were produced by β-H elimination at Au nanoparticles, which could occur via transfer of either a hydrogen atom or hydride. Finally, the Au-H hydride could be oxidized by the Cu2+−OH intermediates, accompanied by water formation and removal, recovering the initial Cu+ and metallic Au state. Thus, the high catalytic activity and selectivity of Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-H could be attributed to the porous support with enhanced surface basicity and the surface Cu+ species. As a result, 84.7 % of GLY conversion and 82.3 % of DHA selectivity can be achieved over Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-H in base-free conditions under optimized reaction conditions (25 mL GLY solution (0.1 mol/L), GLY/Au metal (mol/mol) = 250, T =80 °C, O2 pressure (MPa) = 0.8, reaction time =6 h). We also compared the catalytic performance of Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-H with that of the reported Au catalysts for GLY oxidation to DHA under base-free conditions in Table S5. The highest yield of DHA achieved is approximately 80 % over Au/CuO (Table S5, Entry 1) and Au/Cu0.9Zr0.1O1.1 (Table S5, Entry 8) under optimized condition in the previous studies, however, the GLY/Au ratio used in their work is as low as 50 mol/mol. [28,30] When the GLY/Au ratio is increased to 100 mol/mol, the best yield of DHA reported is 73.5 % over Au/CuO (Table S5, Entry 10), in our work, although the GLY/Au ratio is 250 mol/mol, Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-H exhibited similar DHA yield, but higher selectivity of DHA. [29] The catalytic cycling experiments were also conducted on Au/CuO and Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-H to examine their stabilities in GLY oxidation. As shown in Fig. 10 , after the each run of the reaction, the catalysts were filtered out, washed with a plenty of deionized water and dried at 200 °C under static air for 3 h. It can be found that the GLY conversion significantly decreases from 36.6 % to 14.2 %, while the DHA selectivity only changed slightly after 4 cycles over Au/CuO. ICP-OES analyses indicate that no detectable Au and approximately 1.37 wt% of Cu in the CuO support were leached into the reaction solution, and TEM images in Figure S5 show the size of Au on the fresh Au/CuO increased from 3.57 ± 0.93 nm to 6.79 ± 4.73 nm on the used Au/CuO. Thus, the leaching of Cu and aggregation of Au nanoparticles could be the main reasons for the deactivation of Au/CuO. Besides, the carbon deposition or adsorption of by-products should be also considered as the possible causes for the deactivation according to the previous studies. [29,30] However, in the case of Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-H, the GLY conversion only declines from 65.6 % to 57.6 % after 4 cycles with preserving its high selectivity to DHA. ICP-OES analyses did not find detectable Au or Cu in the reaction solution after the recycling experiments. Moreover, Table S2, Table S3 and Figure S5-S8 confirmed that CuxO species are still well preserved in NPC framework in a highly dispersed state in the used Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-H (denoted as Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-S), the size of Au nanoparticles remained almost unchanged on Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-S, and more importantly, the surface Cu content only decreased from 4.71 at% on Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-H to 4.52 at% on Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-S, indicating that the carbon deposition is not severe on the Au/Cu-NPCs. In addition, Table S2, Table S3 and Figure S8 show that the surface Cu+ content, BET surface area and mesopore volume reduced from 2.38 at%, 355.6 m2/g and 0.182 cm3/g for Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-H to 2.32 at%, 335.3 m2/g and 0.144 cm3/g for Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-S, respectively. These slight decreases could be responsible for the minor deactivation of Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-H. However, compared with Au/CuO, Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-H exhibited much higher stability than that of Au/CuO during the recycling experiments. 4 Conclusions In this work, NPC stabilized CuxO were first prepared by a one-pot method using copper nitrate as copper precursor with the aid of Pluronic F127 under acidic condition. It was found that CuO and Cu2O existed in NPC framework in a highly dispersed state due to the strong interaction between CuxO species and N atoms (pyridinic N and pyrrolic N) after the carbonation and followed calcination under static air. The obtained NPC stabilized CuxO were used as supports to prepare Au catalysts for GLY oxidation to DHA under base-free conditions. During the reaction, the porous characteristics of the supports promoted the adsorption of the secondary OH groups of GLY onto Au nanoparticles, the enhanced surface basicity accelerates the alkoxide formation by abstracting proton from GLY and the surface Cu+ species, which can activate O2 molecules instead of Au nanoparticles to produce active oxygen species (O− or O2-), also facilitate the cleavage of OH bond of GLY to form metal alkoxide intermediates. As a result, Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-H, which is the best catalyst in Au/Cu-NPCs, exhibited much better catalytic activity and selectivity than those of Au/CuO, 84.7 % of GLY conversion with 82.3 % selectivity to DHA with 250 of GLY/Au metal molar ratio can be achieved under optimized conditions. In addition, Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-H also possesses much higher catalytic stability than that of Au/CuO during four consecutive catalytic runs, because of the stabilization of CuxO species by NPC, relatively stable surface Cu+ content, and the strong interaction between Au nanoparticles and the supports. This work provides a viable way for the design of highly efficient Au catalysts for selective oxidation of biomass molecules under base-free conditions.

        "dc:description": "In this work, N-doped porous carbon stabilized CuxO (Cu-NPCs) were synthesized by a one-pot method using copper nitrate as copper precursor with the aid of Pluronic F127 under acidic condition. The characterization results confirmed that CuxO species (CuO and Cu2O) existed in NPC in a highly dispersed state due to the strong interaction between CuxO and the doped N atoms. The obtained Cu-NPCs were used as supports to prepare Au catalysts for glycerol (GLY) oxidation to dihydroxyacetone (DHA) under base-free conditions. During the reaction, GLY preferentially adsorbed onto Au nanoparticles via the secondary OH groups due to the porous characteristics of the supports, the enhanced surface basicity from the N functionalities accelerates the alkoxide formation by abstracting proton from GLY, and the surface Cu+ sites instead of Au nanoparticles activate O2 molecules to produce active oxygen species, as a result, Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-H, which is the best catalyst in Au/Cu-NPCs, exhibited much higher catalytic activity and selectivity than those of Au/CuO. Moreover, due to the stabilization of CuxO species by NPC, relatively stable surface Cu+ content, and the strong interaction between Au nanoparticles and the supports, Au/Cu-NPC-15 %-H also possessed much better catalytic stability than that of Au/CuO during four consecutive catalytic runs.",
