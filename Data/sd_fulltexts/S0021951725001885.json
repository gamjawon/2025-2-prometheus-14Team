In-depth dissecting the activation of C-Cl bonds and the migration transformation of dissociated chlorine species is significant to understand the mechanism underlying the formation of polychlorinated by products and chlorine poisoning deactivation of catalyst during of the photocatalytic degradation of chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs). Herein, carbon nanolayers wrapped TiO2 composites (CTO), and its contrastive catalysts including defective carbon nanolayers wrapped TiO2 (DCTO) and TiO2 without carbon nanolayer (TO) are constructed by rational pyrolysis of titanium-based MOFs. The obtained CTO exhibits a remarkable degradation efficiency of up to 91.74 % for CH2Cl2 after 3 h of UV–vis irradiation, robust stability as well as water resistance, far superior to that of DCTO and TO. Density functional theory calculations combined with in-situ XPS reveal that the heterogeneous interface interactions between carbon nanolayers and TiO2 greatly facilitate the separation of photogenerated carriers, boosting the redox capacity of CTO. Simultaneously, the dissociated Cl species from the cleavage of the C-Cl bond can be preferentially adsorbed onto the outer carbon nanolayers, thereby inhibiting the occupation of TiO2 active sites by chlorine. The preferential adsorption sites of the dissociated Cl species and optimized deep oxidation ability synergistically boost the catalytic performance and resistance of chlorine poisoning and inhibit the production of polychlorinated by-products.

For example, dichloromethane (CH2Cl2, DCM), a representative CVOC, widely emitted from solvent use, pharmaceuticals manufacturing, printing and spraying, has always been the focus of attention due to its serious threat to the respiratory system and central nervous system of the human body [5,6]. Recently, photocatalytic oxidation technology with low cost, simple operation, and environmental friendly features has been vigorously developed for VOCs purification [7,8]. Unfortunately, compared to non-chlorinated VOCs, the photocatalytic degradation of CVOCs involves in the initial cleavage of C-Cl and subsequent migration and transformation of the dissociated chlorine species [9,10]. As a result, the presence of chlorine species would react again with intermediates and catalysts, resulting in the formation of polychlorinated by-products and irreversible deactivation of catalyst [11]. They are also two key factors that make photocatalytic oxidation difficult to achieve further breakthroughs in the field of CVOCs removal [12]. In this respect, improving the oxidation capacity of photocatalyst to accelerate intermediates deep degradation into final products (CO2, H2O, HCl and/or Cl2) offers a promising avenue for lowering the contact probability between the dissociated chlorine species and intermediates. Furthermore, preventing the adsorption of chlorine species on active sites has also attracted much attention for the protection of catalyst from chlorine poisoning. Therefore, the development of powerful photocatalysts featuring excellent deep oxidation activity and superior chlorine resistance is of great importance, which is also essential to understand the intrinsic CVOCs reaction mechanism. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with unique structural flexibility, large specific surface area, and tuneable porosity have been extensively explored in the accurate construction of highly efficient catalysts [13–15]. In addition to being used directly, MOFs can also be served as sacrificial templates to derive various metal oxides by heat or chemical treatment under different conditions [16,17]. Benefited from their periodic structures, MOFs-derived metal oxides could inherited their maternal structural and compositional advantages, including large surface area, uniform heteroatom doping (e.g., N, S), highly dispersed active sites and controllable composition, which is difficult to be realized by traditional synthesis methods [18–20]. More interestingly, due to the high carbon content and the well-defined environment of metal ions and organic ligands in MOFs, carbon wrapped metal oxides composites with orderly dispersion and high porosity can be prepared by calcination in an inert atmosphere [21]. It is well known that the remarkable conductivity of the carbon nanolayer can effectively promote electron migration to prolong carrier lifetime. On the other hand, the outstanding stability of carbon in acid-base atmospheres and excellent adsorption property to substrate molecules favours the protection of its interior active sites. Therefore, MOF-derived photocatalysts with highly dispersed active sites and proper carbon nanolayer might be feasible to overcome the above drawbacks of traditional photocatalyst in the CVOCs photocatalytic oxidation due to the enhanced oxidation ability and the in-situ grown chlorine resistant protective layer on active sites. Herein, the carbon nanolayers wrapped TiO2 composite (denoted as CTO) is prepared by high-temperature calcination of a typical Ti-MOF, MIL-125(Ti), for boosting the photocatalytic oxidation of CVOCs and unveiling the enhancement mechanism. DCM is chosen as a model substrate because it is one of the most stable chlorinated alkanes [22]. For comparison purposes, TiO2 without carbon nanolayer (TO), defective carbon nanolayers wrapped TiO2 (DCTO) are also prepared by changing the gas atmosphere during the calcination process and MOF precursor, respectively. The results demonstrated that carbon nanolayers wrapping boosts DCM degradation performance and water resistance as well as stability of TiO2-based photocatalyst. In-situ characterization methods combined with DFT theoretical calculations reveal that the DCM preferentially participates in the reaction at the Ti site in TiO2, and the resulting Cl species would be captured by the outer carbon nanolayers. This effectively restrain the occupation of the active site by Cl species and the chlorination reaction. In addition, the formed heterogeneous interface between the carbon nanolayers and TiO2 can be used as a charge transport channel to promote the migration of photogenerated carriers, accelerating the consumptions of the intermediates and DCM in photocatalytic reactions. Furthermore, the photogenerated carrier migration pathway, the key intermediates in DCM degradation process, and interfacial synergistic catalytic mechanism are also elucidated. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials All reagents are analytical grade and directly utilized without further purification. Detailed information is provided in the Supporting Information. 2.2 Catalyst preparation The prepared MIL-125(Ti) were calcined at 500 °C for 4 h under Ar atmosphere with a ramp rate of 2 °C/min, and then calcined in a dry air atmosphere at 350 °C for 2 h to remove the unstable carbon. Finally, the CTO was obtained after cooling to room temperature. The TO was prepared in a similar way to CTO except changing the calcination atmosphere of Ar to dry air. The DCTO was obtained using the same procedure as CTO except using NH2-MIL-125(Ti) to substitute MIL-125(Ti). 2.3 Photocatalytic activity evaluation The photocatalytic activity of the synthesized materials was assessed by degrading DCM in a continuous flow reactor at room temperature (Scheme S1). Typically, 0.25 g of photocatalyst was filled into our custom-made cubic quartz glass reactor. A xenon lamp (300 W) was then placed vertically 10 cm above the reactor as a light source. Subsequently, the feed gas composed of 70 ± 1 ppm DCM and air was introduced into the reactor at a flow rate of 30 mL/min. The concentrations of the remaining DCM and the formed CO2 in the effluent gas were determined using an in-line gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with two flame ion detectors (FID). Finally, the DCM degradation rate (η), the mineralization rate (g), and (α) CO2 selectivity were calculated by the following formula: η (%) = (1-C/C0) × 100 %; g (%) = CCO2/C0 × 100 %; α (%) = g/η, where C and C0 were the concentration of DCM in the outlet and inlet, CCO2 was the concentration of CO2 in the outlet at any given time. 2.4 Details of DFT calculations All spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed on the “Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package”, and the electron exchange and relations were handled using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) within a generalized gradient approximation (GGA). We have chosen the Projected Enhanced Wave (PAW) method with an energy cut-off of 400 eV to describe the interaction between core electrons and valence electrons. The ionic relaxation convergence criterion was set to 0.05 eV/Å. To accurately describe the local electron state, the on-site coulomb interaction correction was applied on the Ti 3d orbital with an effective U-value of 4.2 eV. The anatase TiO2 (101) surfaces, carbon nanolayers and C/TiO2 (101) heterojunctions model were constructed based on the HRTEM and XRD results. We set up a vacuum layer of ∼20 Å to avoid the interaction between neighbouring slabs. After the structural optimization was completed, the electron local function, density of states, electrostatic potential and differential charge density were calculated. The adsorption energy (E ads) was defined as the following equation: E ads = E tot − E mol − E sub, where E tot, E sub, and E mol were the total energy of the adsorption structure, the catalytic substrate, and individual small molecule, respectively. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structure characterization and morphology analysis As shown in Fig. S1a, MIL-125(Ti) and NH2-MIL-125(Ti) exhibit almost identical X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks, with 2θ = 6.8°, 9.8°, and 11.7° corresponding to the (101), (002), and (211) crystal planes, respectively [23,24]. Meanwhile, the presence of NH2 functional groups in NH2-MIL-125(Ti) is confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum (Fig. S1b) [25]. The above results suggest that MIL-125(Ti) and NH2-MIL-125(Ti) are successfully prepared. In Fig. 1 a, the CTO, DCTO and TO derived from Ti-MOFs materials exhibit XRD diffraction peaks of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS No. 84‐1286). Notably, the anatase TiO2 characteristic peaks of DCTO and CTO are significantly broadened and weakened compared with that of TO, which would be due to the presence of carbon nanolayers in the DCTO and CTO samples. The Raman characteristic peaks of CTO, DCTO and TO (Fig. 1b) at 143 cm−1, 396 cm−1, 514 cm−1, and 637 cm−1 are classified as the typical Eg(1), B1g, A1g, and Eg(2) peaks of anatase TiO2 [26], respectively, in which TO exhibits the highest and narrowest characteristic peaks of anatase TiO2, in consistent with the XRD observations. Besides, for DCTO and CTO, two Raman peaks appear in the 1350–1600 cm−1 (Fig. S2), which are attributed to the D and G peaks of graphitized carbon, respectively. Nevertheless, the two characteristic peaks do not appear in the TO sample. These results further demonstrate the formation of carbon nanolayers in DCTO and CTO samples, but no carbon nanolayer exists in the TO sample. Obviously, the ID/IG ratio of the CTO is significantly lower than that of the DCTO, indicating that the mixing of N atoms into the carbon nanolayer causes a higher degree of carbon defects (Fig. S2) [27]. The FT-IR spectra of the CTO, DCTO and TO (Fig. 1c) is analysed to further confirm the above results. The characteristic peaks observed at 1058 cm−1, 1397 cm−1, and 1630 cm−1 in the DCTO and CTO catalysts are attributed to C-O, C=C, Ti-O bonds, respectively [28,29]. Interestingly, there are no characteristic peaks of C=C and C-O bonds in TO, which indicates that there is no carbon nanolayer encapsulated on its surface. For DCTO, the characteristic peak strength of C=C and C-O bonds is significantly weaker than that of CTO, which can also be verified by the Raman results that DCTO have a higher degree of carbon defects than CTO. The N2 adsorption–desorption isothermal curves are used to investigate the specific surface area and porosity of TO, DCTO, and CTO (Fig. S3). The all display a IV type adsorption curve, indicating that the mesoporous structure exists in the three catalysts [30]. The presence of mesoporous structure in all materials is conducive to accelerating the activation and diffusion of the substrate, thereby effectively promoting the photocatalytic reaction process [31–33]. The BET specific surface areas of TO, DCTO, and CTO (Table S1) are 61.514 m2/g, 254.27 m2/g and 281.88 m2/g, respectively. Such a noticeable increase in BET specific surface area of DCTO and CTO, which could be attributed to the presence of carbon nanolayers [34]. The morphology of TO, DCTO, and CTO is shown in Fig. 1d–f and Fig. S4-S5. As expected, both the DCTO and CTO inherited the typical caky morphology of their parent MOFs. However, it is worth noting that the TO is presented as irregular small particles. Such a significant difference between the TO and the DCTO and CTO would be closely related to the formed carbon nanolayer during the DCTO and CTO preparations. For the DCTO and CTO, the carbonization of MOF precursors can be obtained in the protection of inert Ar gas, and the formed carbon nanolayer would effectively maintain the initial morphology of their parent MOF. Whereas the carbon element in MOFs is readily oxidized to CO2 at high temperature under dry-air conditions, leading to the collapse of MOF framework during the TO preparation. Interestingly, all the TO, DCTO, and CTO samples own the same lattice spacing of 0.35 nm observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), corresponding to (101) crystal planes of anatase TiO2 [35]. The XRD and Raman together with HRTEM analyses suggest that TiO2 in the TO, DCTO and CTO samples have the same crystal phase and exposed facet, featuring (101) facet dominant anatase phase. Moreover, the signals of the C, O, and Ti elements in the CTO sample are clearly detectable from the HAADF mapping image and are evenly distributed across the sample. To determine the surface composition and chemical state of the samples, high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement is carried out. For the CTO sample shown in Fig. 1g, the characteristic peaks at 529.76 eV, 531.23 eV and 532.05 eV in the O 1s orbitals, assignable to the O2− species of the TiO2 lattice, the C-O-C and/or C-OH species, and hydroxyl groups, respectively (Table S2) [36,37]. The Ti 2p high-resolution spectrum (Fig. 1h) can be deconvoluted into two peaks, corresponding to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2, respectively. Moreover, the difference between the two peaks is approximately 5.7 eV, which is typical of Ti4+ corresponding to anatase TiO2 [38]. As controls, the DCTO and TO samples is also characterized by XPS. Similar O 1s and Ti 2p spectra are observed among the CTO, DCTO and TO samples. Noticeably, for the CTO and DCTO samples with carbon nanolayers, the characteristic peaks assigned to Ti-O band in the O 1s spectrum and the characteristic peaks in the Ti 2p spectrum both shift to higher binding energies compared to that of TO sample without carbon nanolayers, while their C-OH and/or C-O-C bands move to lower binding energies, suggesting the interfacial contact between the carbon nanolayer and TiO2 [36]. In addition, the presence of N elements in the carbon nanolayer in the DCTO sample is specifically analyzed (Fig. 1i), and the peaks centered at 398.97 eV and 400.25 eV are attributed to pyridine nitrogen and pyrrole nitrogen, respectively [39]. This is important information for our subsequent analysis of the role of N atoms in the photocatalytic oxidation of DCM. 3.2 Photoelectrochemical properties and charge transfer mechanism of photocatalysts In order to explore the role of carbon nanolayers in enhancing the light responsiveness of TiO2, the optical properties and energy band structure are first analysed by UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy and photoelectrochemical tests. As depicted in Fig. 2 a, both the CTO and DCTO samples with carbon nanolayers display a noticeable light absorption in the visible region compared to the TO without carbon nanolayers and commercial P25. Specifically, the light absorption intensity of TO and commercial P25 are virtually zero in the region of 400–800 nm. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the DCTO with higher degree of carbon defect compared to CTO exhibits weaker light absorption capacity. These results demonstrate that the presence of carbon nanolayers on TiO2 surface could extend the range of light response, and the degree of carbon defect on the material would have a negative effect on its light absorption capacity. Additionally, the absorption edges of TO, DCTO, and CTO all display obvious redshifts relative to P25, demonstrating the superiority of pyrolysis of MOF for preparing TiO2. Furthermore, the optical band gap energy of P25, TO, DCTO, and CTO is estimated to be 3.18 eV, 2.91 eV, 2.82 eV, and 2.76 eV based on the equation: α h v = A ( h v - E g ) n 2 , respectively (Fig. 2b). Among them, the CTO exhibits the narrowest band-gap width, indicating that the material is more susceptible to photoexcitation. The Mott-Schottky plot is performed to estimate the band structure. The results display that TO, DCTO and CTO are a typical n-type semiconductor with a flat band potential (EFB) of −0.31, −0.39 and −0.45 eV vs normal hydrogen electrode (Fig. 2c), and their corresponding conduction band (ECB) positions are −0.41, −0.49, −0.55 eV (calculated by ECB = EFB − 0.1), respectively. The conduction band position of the photocatalyst directly determines the reduction ability of photogenerated electrons, which is a key factor in the production of •O2 − [40]. It is well known that the ECB positions of the widely used anatase TiO2 are generally considered to be −0.24 eV [41]. Obviously, MOF-derived TiO2 has a more negative conduction band position than conventional anatase TiO2 (Fig. S6), thus it was reasonably expected that TO, DCTO and CTO are likely to generate •O2 − more easily to promoter the photocatalytic oxidation of DCM. Subsequently, the valance band positions of TO, DCTO and CTO can be calculated to be 2.50 eV, 2.33 eV and 2.21 eV (EVB = Eg + ECB), respectively. They are apparently more positive than the standard redox potential of OH–/•OH (1.99 eV), implying that the above three samples all have the potential to oxidize OH– into •OH [42]. To further elucidate how the carbon nanolayer could reduce the bandgap energy of TiO2 at the atomic level, density of states (DOS) calculation is carried out (Fig. 2d–e). The results show that the bandgap widths of the TiO2(101) and C/TiO2(101) models are 2.60 eV and 2.39 eV, respectively, which is in accordance with the decreased bandgap energy of CTO compared to TO (Fig. 2b). The existence of carbon nanolayers significantly weakens the bandgap energy of the original TiO2 material and produces an intermediate energy level. Moreover, the charge density around the Fermi level in C/TiO2(101) model the is clearly higher than in the TiO2(101) model. Therefore, the carbon nanolayers tend to promote more carriers to overcome the wide bandgap of TiO2, and subsequently transfer from valance band to intermediate energy level [43]. Thus resulting in a decreased band gap in C/TiO2(101) model compared to TiO2(101) model. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra for TO, DCTO, and CTO are recorded for a deeper understanding of charge carrier transfer kinetics, as shown in Fig. 2f and Table S3. As expected, the average lifetime of CTO (0.302 ns) is shorter than that of DCTO (0.376 ns) and TO (0.440 ns), reflecting the CTO has an effective photogenerated carrier transfer channel between TiO2 and carbon nanolayers, thereby accelerating the photogenerated carrier separation and migration efficiency. This conclusion is further supported by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and photocurrent response diagram. As displayed in Fig. 2g, the arc radius in the Nyquist plots decreased in the order of TO＞DCTO＞CTO, in which CTO has the minimum resistance according to the smallest radius. Meanwhile, the CTO also demonstrated the highest photocurrent intensity (Fig. S7). The shorter fluorescent lifetime, lower resistance, and stronger photocurrent response means that the photogenerated carriers can migrate more easily in the CTO sample than in the DCTO and TO sample, further hindering the recombination of electron-hole pair. To explore the reasons for the improved charge transfer dynamics in CTO, the separation and transfer mechanism of photogenerated carriers at the atomic level is studied in detail by DFT calculations. Through the differential charge density calculation (Fig. 2h), it can be found that when the carbon nanolayer and TiO2 come into contact with each other, the electrons would flow from the carbon nanolayer to the O atom in TiO2, which can also be clearly demonstrated by the higher degree of electron localization in the interfacial region than that away from the interface as observed in the electron local function (ELF) diagram (Fig. 2i) [44]. Furthermore, we perform work function calculations to investigate the charge transfer mechanism between the carbon nanolayer and TiO2. As shown in the Fig. 2j–k, the work functions of the carbon nanolayer and TiO2 are 4.21 eV and 7.05 eV, respectively, indicating that the Fermi energy (Ef) of the carbon nanolayer (Ef = −3.379 eV) is much less negative than the TiO2 (Ef = −2.762 eV). The change of the work function contribute to the formation of the interfacial electric field (IEF) between the carbon nanolayer and TiO2, which can significantly accelerate the rapid separation and movement of charge carriers, playing a decisive role in improving the photocatalytic reaction activity [45]. To demonstrate this hypothesis, the electrostatic potential of C/TiO2(101) is further calculated. As illustrated in Fig. 2l, when the carbon nanolayer interacts with TiO2, it allows different phases to be at the same Fermi energy level, thus demonstrating that IEF is generated between the carbon nanolayer and the TiO2 interface. In addition, the electrostatic potential difference of 7.2 eV between the carbon nanolayer and TiO2 and the deeper electrostatic potential of carbon nanolayer than that of the TiO2, indicate that there is a tendency for electrons to transfer from the carbon nanolayer to TiO2 [46,47], which is consistent with the differential charge calculation results (Fig. 2h). Therefore, it can be confirmed that there is a strong electronic interaction between the carbon nanolayer and TiO2 interface, as well as the presence of a charge transport channel of C-O-Ti, which is the main factor improving photoelectrochemical performance of CTO. 3.3 Photocatalytic performance analysis With the experimental and DFT results above, TiO2 wrapped with carbon nanolayers has been successfully constructed in CTO sample, and it exhibits superior optical and photoelectrochemical properties. Inspired by these, the photocatalytic activities of the as-prepared samples are comprehensively evaluated by dynamic monitoring of DCM and CO2 concentrations in a continuous flow reactor. As shown in Fig. 3 a–c and Table S4, the DCM removal efficiency of TO, DCTO and CTO after 3 h of light irradiation are 55.60 % ± 2.92 %, 51.12 % ± 0.42 % and 91.74 % ± 1.72 %, accompanied by the mineralization rates of 34.68 % ± 3.23 %, 37.28 % ± 0.80 % and 63.90 % ± 2.53 %, respectively. Additionally, no noticeable DCM degradation and CO2 formation is observed in the absence of photocatalyst, indicating that the photocatalyst plays a decisive role in the catalytic system. Notably, CTO with carbon nanolayers displays significantly higher the DCM degradation efficiency and CO2 yield than TO without carbon nanolayers and DCTO with higher degree of carbon defects. Considering the same crystal phase and exposed facet of TiO2 in the three photocatalysts, the improved photocatalytic performance of CTO would be attributed to the promotion of carbon nanolayers with less surface defects. Compared with commercial P25, CTO also has distinctly higher deep degradation efficiency for DCM, and the photocatalytic activity is comparable to that of TiO2-based photocatalysts reported in other literature on photocatalytic CVOCs field (Table S5), demonstrating the superior potential of CTO in CVOCs removal. To validate the possible intermediates in the DCM process over the CTO photocatalyst that are not completely converted to CO2, we collected the exhaust gas after the reaction and performed gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) measurements. As shown in Fig. S8 and Table S6, CO2 and O2 occupies almost the entire adsorption peak in the test range, but there are still some absorption peaks corresponding to CH3Cl and HCOOH species. Moreover, no polychloride by-products are detected in the exhaust gas, which confirmed that the dissociated Cl species would be not involved in the chlorination reaction throughout the photocatalytic reaction. This inference is also supported by the exceptional selectivity to CO2. Meanwhile, the recovered exhaust gases are tested using ion chromatography (ICS) to determine the final form of the dissociated Cl species after the reaction (Table S7). The results show that the inorganic chlorine species at the outlet eventually existed as chlorine gas formation regardless of the presence or absence of water vapor. Anatase TiO2 has been widely reported as an excellent photocatalyst for the Deacon reaction [48]. Therefore, the dissociated Cl undergoes the Deacon reaction and is eventually converted to Cl2 during the DCM photocatalytic oxidation over CTO, thereby obtaining such high Cl2 selectivity. Furthermore, the cycling stability of TO and CTO is evaluated. After a total of 540 min of photocatalytic reactions, CTO maintained a high level of DCM degradation and mineralization, with only a slight decrease in catalyst activity (Fig. 3d–f and Tables S8-S9). However, it can be clearly found that the degradation rate of DCM over the TO without carbon nanolayers is significantly reduced to only about 38 % after third cycle tests, which further confirms that carbon nanolayers play an indispensable role in preventing catalyst deactivation during the photocatalytic oxidation of DCM. The XRD characteristic peaks of CTO before and after three runs are almost identical (Fig. S9), confirming that the lattice structure of the CTO sample would not be damaged in the photocatalytic oxidation DCM reaction. Water resistance of photocatalyst is a key factor in assessing its practical application potential. Therefore, the photocatalytic activity of CTO is examined by introducing 2 vol% water vapors into the feed gases (Scheme S2). Strikingly, distinctly different from the commonly observed deactivation in many reports [49–51], the CTO still maintains a stable and excellent DCM mineralization rate even under such a high humid condition which is almost identical to that in dry condition, demonstrating negligible effect of water vapor on the CO2 production efficiency of CTO (Fig. S10 and Table S10). Nevertheless, there is a slight reduction in the degradation rate of DCM in the humid condition, which is mainly attributed to the occupation of active site by H2O due to the competitive adsorption between numerous water molecules and DCM at the active site [10]. The above results clearly manifest that the CTO sample has fascinating photocatalytic oxidation activity for DCM, robust water resistance and excellent stability, demonstrating its great potential toward the removal of complicated CVOCs. 3.4 Proposed photocatalytic DCM oxidation mechanism To elucidate the mechanism behind the boosted photocatalytic performance of CTO, the adsorption energy calculations are performed to determine the preferred adsorption sites for DCM and dissociated chlorine species in the CTO catalyst. As displayed in Fig. S11a–b, the adsorption energies of DCM on the carbon nanolayer and TiO2 are −0.33 eV and −0.55 eV, respectively, indicating that DCM is easier to adsorb and activate on the surface of TiO2. It is worth noting that the bond length of the C-Cl bond in the DCM molecule adsorbed on the surface of TiO2 is longer than that of the non-adsorbed C-Cl bond (Fig. S12), which further confirms that the cleavage of the C-Cl bond in DCM activation mainly occurs at the Ti active site on the surface of TiO2. Moreover, we calculated the adsorption energy of the Cl ions to determine the transfer pathway of the dissociated chlorine species. It can be found that the adsorption energy of Cl ions in the carbon nanolayer is much lower than that of TiO2 (Fig. S11c–d), which suggests that the dissociated chlorine species are preferentially captured by the carbon nanolayer. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that the protection of the TiO2 active site from chlorination by the preferential adsorption of dissociated chlorine species on carbon nanolayer should be responsible for the excellent stability and high CO2 yield of CTO. Interestingly, when the N atom is mixed with the carbon nanolayer to form the carbon defect (pyrrole nitrogen and pyridine nitrogen), the activity of DCTO significantly reduced in the photocatalytic degradation of DCM. The DFT theoretical calculations in Fig. S13 demonstrate the adsorption energy of Cl ions on N atoms mixed with carbon nanolayers is significantly higher than that of carbon nanolayers, indicating the adverse effect of mixing N with carbon nanolayers on Cl ions capture. Some studies have also confirmed that N atoms as base sites have a poor adsorption and capture capacity for Cl ions [52,53]. In addition, the high degree of carbon defects also hinders the charge transport channel of C-O-Ti, resulting in the obstruction of separation and transfer between photogenerated carriers, as demonstrated by charge transfer and photoelectrochemical properties in Fig. 2. Thus, compared to CTO photocatalyst, the mixing of N atoms in DCTO weakens the trapping of dissociated chlorine species by the carbon nanolayer and increases recombination of photogenerated carriers, thus exhibiting lower photocatalytic activity. In-situ XPS spectra is carried out to more intuitively verify the charge transfer mechanism in photocatalytic DCM reactions. When the DCM is adsorbed on the CTO surface, both the O1s and Ti2p signals change to lower binding energies (Fig. 4 a–b and Table S11). Given that the Lewis basic Cl in DCM molecule could enriches the surface of TiO2 with electrons by forming adducts [54], the decreased binding energies of O 1s and Ti 2p would result from the DCM adsorption on TiO2, as revealed by adsorption energy calculations (Fig. S11). After UV illumination, the Ti 2p signal shifts slightly towards the lower binding energy, while the signal for O1s moves towards the higher binding energy. These variations might come from the excitation of electrons from the O-dominated VB to the Ti-dominated conduction band [54], which also responds perfectly to the DOS calculations. In addition, in the Cl 2p spectrum (Fig. 4c), the signal of the Cl species is not monitored before the DCM is introduced. After the DCM is introduced, the Cl species can be divided into two peaks at 198.12 eV and 199.83 eV, corresponding to Cl 2p3/2 and Cl 2p1/2, respectively [55,56]. More importantly, the shift of the Cl species signal peak to high binding energy under light conditions means that Cl species would further lose electrons, thus reflecting the dissociation of C-Cl in the DCM under light to form a free ionic state. In-situ DRIFTS spectroscopy is carried out in the dark adsorption and photocatalytic oxidation stages to trace the intermediate species and reaction pathways of DCM over the CTO photocatalyst in detail. After the introduction of DCM to the surface of the CTO catalyst (Fig. 4d), the absorption peaks at 2990, 1420 and 1270 cm−1corresponding to DCM can be observed. Among them, the absorption peaks of 2990 cm−1 and 1420 cm−1 are assigned to the stretching and bending vibration of C–H bonds in DCM, respectively [57,58]. The peak of 1270 cm−1 can correspond to the vibration signal of –CH2-, and the intensity of this peak increases with time, which means that DCM accumulates on the CTO surface [59,60]. In addition, the peak at 1653 cm−1 and the absorption peaks in the range of 3500–3800 cm−1 are the characteristic peak of H2O and hydroxyl functional groups, indicating that the CTO also adsorbs a certain amount of H2O molecular, as reported previously [10,61]. After the DCM adsorption–desorption equilibrium is reached, the changes in adsorption species on the surface of the CTO photocatalyst are monitored under UV–Vis light irradiation (Fig. 4e). Two new strong bands at 2891 and 2810 cm−1can be assigned to the stretching vibration of C–H, while the peaks of 1602 and 1555 cm−1 can be attributed to the stretching vibration of C=O. Moreover, the intensities of the above peaks increase with increasing illumination time [58,61–63]. These suggest the formation of possible intermediate species of formaldehyde (HCHO) and formic acid (HCOOH) during photocatalytic DCM oxidation process, which are also key intermediates for subsequent deep oxidation to final CO2. Meanwhile, the absorption bands appeared at 1539, 1493, 1436, 1386 cm−1 correspond to the C−H deformation of adsorbed hydrocarbons. Moreover, the stretching vibration band corresponding to –CH2- in the DCM at 1271 cm−1 gradually migrated to the stretching vibration band corresponding to C-O at 1261 cm−1 under light conditions [10]. These variations may be attributed to the generated intermediates (such as CH3OH, HCHO, HCOOH and CH3Cl) via the initial dechlorination and step-by-step oxidation of the DCM under light conditions [64,65]. More importantly, the adsorption peak corresponding to CO2 at 2306 cm−1 and the absorption peak corresponding to H2O molecule at 3273 cm−1 can be observed, which is almost undetectable under dark conditions, demonstrating the formation of the final products of CO2 and H2O in the photocatalytic reaction [66,67]. Combined with the gas composition at the outlet after DCM photocatalytic oxidation (Fig. S8 and Table S6), it would be deduced that DCM is first dechlorinated and oxidized into CH3OH, HCHO, and then HCOOH, and finally degraded into CO2 and H2O. In principle, the photocatalytic oxidation process is generally accompanied by the production of reactive oxygen species, which is a key factor in governing the oxidation efficiency. Therefore, DMPO spin-trapping EPR measurements are supplied to observe the potential active oxygen species during the DCM photocatalytic oxidation by CTO. No signal peaks can be observed from the EPR spectra in Fig. 4f without light illumination. Upon being exposed to light, the characteristic signal peaks of superoxide radical (•O2 −) and hydroxyl radical (•OH) distinctly appear. These results manifest that the CTO enables generation of numerous •O2 − and •OH during the DCM photocatalytic oxidation, in accordance with its energy positions of conduction and valence band. Based on the above analysis, a possible reaction mechanism for photocatalytic oxidation of DCM over CTO is proposed (Scheme S3). During the DCM photocatalytic oxidation, DCM molecules are first absorbed and undergoes the C–Cl bond cleavage at the metal Ti sites on the CTO photocatalyst to produce abundant non-chlorinated and little monochlorinated intermediates. Meanwhile, CTO can readily generate a number of highly reactive •O2 − and •OH species under light irradiation, as demonstrated by EPR results (Eqs. (1)–(4)). Subsequently, these intermediates will be attacked by the formed •O2 − and •OH and successively oxidized to CH3OH, HCHO and HCOOH etc., and finally degraded into CO2 and H2O (Eqs. (5)–(10)). The excellent deep oxidation ability of CTO facilitates the rapid elimination of the above intermediates, which is crucial to prevent the generation of polychlorinated by products. On the other hand, the dissociated chlorine species are transferred and captured by the carbon nanolayer, and thus prevent them from occupying the Ti active site, which account for outstanding stability and recyclability of CTO. Then, the dissociated chlorine species would convert to Cl2 via the Deacon Reaction and release from the CTO surface (Eq. 11). The excellent oxidation ability and optimal adsorption of dissociated chlorine on CTO synergistically guarantee the high deep degradation activity and low potential for generating polychlorinated by products. 4 Conclusion In summary, to uncover the mechanism of CVOCs photocatalytic degradation for design of highly efficient and chlorine resistant photocatalyst, a promising photocatalyst with carbon nanolayers wrapped TiO2 is constructed by controlled pyrolysis of Ti-based MOF. The formed interface between the carbon nanolayer and TiO2 in CTO could induce an interfacial electric field which accelerates the separation of photogenerated carriers, thus producing plentiful reactive oxygen species, including •O2 − and •OH with high oxidation ability. Moreover, the dissociated chlorine species after the C-Cl cleavage can be preferentially captured by the outer carbon nanolayer as evidenced by in-situ XPS and DFT calculation, preventing the occupation and probable chlorination of the TiO2 active site by chlorine species to improve catalytic stability against chlorine poisoning. Subsequently, the non-chlorinated intermediates (CH3OH, HCHO, HCOOH, etc.) produced after dechlorination reaction can be further oxidized into CO2 and H2O by strong reactive oxygen species to induce the reaction probability between the dissociated chlorine species and intermediates, restraining the production of polychlorinated by-products. Meanwhile, the dissociated chlorine species would eventually be converted to Cl2 and released from the CTO surface. Mechanism investigations reveal that the synergistic interplay between strong oxidation ability and preferential adsorption site for dissociated chlorine species induced by carbon nanolayers is ascribed to the high deep degradation performance of DCM and excellent stability as well as low polychlorinated by-products. In the future, we will explore new strategies to quantify the specific thickness of carbon nanolayers, and provide more direct experimental and theoretical evidence for the specific effect mechanism of carbon nanolayer thickness on catalytic performance.

        "dc:description": "In-depth dissecting the activation of C-Cl bonds and the migration transformation of dissociated chlorine species is significant to understand the mechanism underlying the formation of polychlorinated by products and chlorine poisoning deactivation of catalyst during of the photocatalytic degradation of chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs). Herein, carbon nanolayers wrapped TiO2 composites (CTO), and its contrastive catalysts including defective carbon nanolayers wrapped TiO2 (DCTO) and TiO2 without carbon nanolayer (TO) are constructed by rational pyrolysis of titanium-based MOFs. The obtained CTO exhibits a remarkable degradation efficiency of up to 91.74 % for CH2Cl2 after 3 h of UV–vis irradiation, robust stability as well as water resistance, far superior to that of DCTO and TO. Density functional theory calculations combined with in-situ XPS reveal that the heterogeneous interface interactions between carbon nanolayers and TiO2 greatly facilitate the separation of photogenerated carriers, boosting the redox capacity of CTO. Simultaneously, the dissociated Cl species from the cleavage of the C-Cl bond can be preferentially adsorbed onto the outer carbon nanolayers, thereby inhibiting the occupation of TiO2 active sites by chlorine. The preferential adsorption sites of the dissociated Cl species and optimized deep oxidation ability synergistically boost the catalytic performance and resistance of chlorine poisoning and inhibit the production of polychlorinated by-products.",
