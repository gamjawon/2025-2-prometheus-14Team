In order to justify the prediction, five preparation methods, including two mechanical mixing ones and three co-precipitation ones were used to prepare the catalysts. It was found that co-precipitation impregnation and co-precipitation of Cu/Zn by NaAIO2 provided the catalyst with the highest activity and co-precipitation of Cu/Zn/A1 by Na2CO3 resulted in the worst catalyst. Combined with the XRD results it is deduced that the active phases for direct synthesis of dimethyl ether from synthesis gas are highly-dispersed fine crystallites of CuO/ZnO/y-A1203. Calcination temperature of the precursor of y-alumina used in the methods of mechanical mixing was also studied. It was found that a calcination temperature of 550 brought about the most active dehydration catalyst with the largest surface area and nearly pure y-alumina of poor crystallinity. So it might be concluded that the active phase for methanol dehydration is fine crystallites of y-alumina.

Introduction Dimethyl ether (DME) is an important chemical and a chemical intermediate for production of gasoline, ethylene, aromatics and other chemicals [1]. Growing attention is being paid to its applications as a fuel or a fuel additive for vehicles and family uses [1-3]. In view of the environmental protection, the substitution of DME for freons as an aerosol spray [4] and a refrigerant [5] is unavoidable. Therefore, the demand for DME will rapidly increase. Furthermore, DME can be produced from synthesis gas coming from feed stocks other than petroleum, so DME will play an important role in the energy transfer. DME can be obtained by dehydration of methanol using acidic porous materials such as zeolites, silica-aluminas, aluminas etc. as catalysts [6] based on the following reaction: 2CH3OH ~ CH3OCH3 + H20 while methanol can be synthesized from synthesis gas according to the reaction as follows: CO + 2H2 ~ CH3OH But it is more advantageous to use synthesis gas as a starting material and synthesize DME in a single step (simplified as STD process) with hybrid catalysts: 2CO + 4H2 ~ CH3OCH3 + H20 Because the shift reaction (CO + H20 ~ CO2 + H2) proceeds very fast, the overall reaction becomes: 3CO + 3H2 ~ CH3OCH3 + CO2 The major merits of the STD process lie in that the equilibrium conversion is much higher than that in methanol synthesis (see Table 1), so it is possible to conduct the STD process at a lower pressure and use synthesis gas from Table 1 CO conversion and product selectivity in methanol synthesis and DME synthesis from synthesis gas at equilibrium a Temperature() Methanol synthesis b DME synthesis c CO conversion (%) d CO conversion (%) d Methanol selectivity (%) d DME selectivity (%) d 250 40.1 94.6 4.2 67.4 260 32.3 92.3 3.6 67.5 270 25.3 89.3 3.5 67.3 a The other reaction conditions: P = 3 MPa (gauge), H2//CO = 2 (mol). b Calculated based on one reaction: 2H2 +CO ~ CHaOH. c Calculated based on three reactions: 2H2 + CO ~ CH3OH; 2CH3OH ~ CH3OCH3 + H20 and CO + H20 CO2 4-H2. d Based on carbon mol. J.-L. Li et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 23-33 25 pressurized coal gasifier without compressors and that the stoichiometry in the STD process is HJCO = 1, so hydrogen-lean synthesis gas can be used. For these and other reasons, the production cost of DME by the STD process is much lower than that by the two step process, methanol synthesis followed by methanol dehydration. For example, according to the economic evaluation, the production cost of DME by the STD process is only about 2/3 of that by the two step process [1]. This is why the STD process was once developed rapidly along with the development of synthesis gas to gasoline processes [7]. There are quite a few patents describing the methods of DME synthesis directly from synthesis gas [8-19]. The methods they used are similar. A feed (synthesis gas with H2 to CO ratios of 1 to 2) was passed over a hybrid catalyst consisting of a methanol synthesis catalyst (Cu/Zn, Zn/A1, Zn/Cr, Cu/Zn/A1, Cu/Zn/Cr, Cu/Zn/Co or Cu/Cr/Fe etc.) and a dehydration catalyst (y- alumina or zeolites etc.) under 240-300, 30-60 bar, and GHSV = 500-5000 h-~ In most of the patents, the hybrid catalysts were made by mechanically mixing the two catalysts. Therefore, the oxides in the hybrid catalysts were not finely dispersed. We will examine the mechanisms of the reactions of methanol synthesis and methanol dehydration based on [20] and [21] respectively. (1) Methanol synthesis: CO+sl~COsl H2 + s2 ~ 2Hs2 COsl + Hs2 ~ HCOsl + s2 HCOsl + Hs2 ~ H2COsl H2COsl + Hs2 ~ H3COsl H3COsl + Hs2 ~ CH3OH + sl + s2 where sl and s2 are two different active sites. (2) Methanol dehydration: CH3OH(g) ~ CH3OH(a) O + CH3OH(a) ~-> CH30(a) + OH CH3OH(a) + CH30(a) ~ CH3OCH3(g) + OH CH30(a) + CH30(a) ~ CH3OCH3(g) + O 2OH ~ H20(g) + O where O is surface oxide which was assumed to cover the surface and 'a' may be acidic or basic sites. If the oxides in the two catalysts for methanol synthesis and methanol dehydration are dispersed close enough, there might be the opportunity for H3COsl to react with CHsOH(a) or CH30(a) and thus the total rate of DME formation will increase. So in order to improve the activity of hybrid catalysts, 26 J.-L. Li et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 23-33 we made great efforts to enhance the dispersion between the oxides in the catalysts by co-precipitation in several ways. The difference between the hybrid catalysts made by co-precipitation and the ordinary methanol synthesis catalysts is the higher content of alumina and the higher calcination temperature in the preparation of the former. The reason for doing so is to produce an adequate amount of y-alumina. Besides, the calcination temperature of y-alumina was also studied so that the most active dehydration catalyst for methanol dehydration could be obtained. This catalyst was used to prepare the hybrid catalysts by mechanical mixing as bases for comparison. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation of alumina 16.4 g NaA102 was dissolved in 200 ml deionized water and the solution was filtered. The clean solution was warmed to 70 in a water bath. Hydrochloric acid of 2 mol/1 was added into the NaA102 solution at a rate of 4 drops/min while the suspension was being stirred until the pH of the suspension reached 8.5-9.0. About 100 ml of hydrochloric acid was consumed. The stirring was continued for 5 min and then the suspension was allowed to stand still for 1 h at 70. The suspension was filtered and the precipitate was washed free of chloride. The precipitate was dried at 120 overnight and calcined at various temperatures for 2 h. 2.2. Preparation of the hybrid catalysts Five different methods were used to prepare the hybrid catalysts including mechanical mixing for comparison. 2.2.1. Method A: low-dispersion mixing A commercial methanol synthesis catalyst (C79-4GL) was crushed and sieved to 20-40 mesh and mixed with y-alumina prepared by the method described in Section 2.1. This y-alumina had been calcined at 550 which proved to be the optimum temperature. The size range of y-alumina was also 20-40 mesh. The weight ratio of the former to the latter was 7/3. 2.2.2. Method B: high-dispersion mixing The two catalysts used in method A were mixed in the same ratio as in method A and ground together to 200 mesh and then the powders were tableted, crushed and sieved to 20-40 mesh. J.-L. Li et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 23-33 27 2.2.3. Method C: co-precipitation impregnation Under vigorous stirring, 150 ml mixed aqueous solution of copper nitrate and zinc nitrate containing 0.066 mol Cu(NO3)2 and 0.033 mol Zn(NO3)2 and 150 ml aqueous solution of NazCO3 containing 13 g Na2CO3 were simultaneously added into a beaker containing 5.1 g y-alumina fine powders and 150 ml deionized water, which had been warmed to 70. The suspension was kept at pH 7.0 +_ 0.2 and 70. After completion of the precipitation, the suspension was aged under 70 for 1 h while being stirred. The precipitate was washed, dried at 80 for 12 h and then calcined at 450 for 12 h. The atomic ratio of Cu/Zn/A1 in the catalyst was 2/1/3. The catalyst powders were tableted, crushed and sieved to get particles with a size range of 20-40 mesh. 2.2.4. Method D: co-precipitation of Cu/Zn by NaAlO2 The precursor of the hybrid catalyst was prepared by simultaneously adding a mixed aqueous solution of copper and zinc nitrates (Cu/Zn atomic ratio was 2/1) with total concentration of 1.0 mol/l and an aqueous solution of sodium aluminate (1.2 mol/1) to a beaker containing 100 ml of deionized water. The suspension in the container was constantly stirred and kept at a pH value of 7.5-7.8 and a temperature of 70 by adjusting the relative flow rate of the two liquids and the heating power. Thus, the precipitate formed according to the following reaction: M2+ + 2AlOe- + 4H20 ~ M(OH)2 $ + 2Al(OH)3 $ where M = Cu, Zn. After precipitation, the suspension was aged at the same temperature for 1 h while being stirred. Then the precipitate was washed, dried at 100 overnight. The final stage of the calcination of the precursor was carried out at 450 for 16 h in an atmosphere of air so that an adequate amount of y-alumina would form in the final catalyst. The atomic ratio of Cu/Zn/A1 was 2/1/6. The catalyst powders were tableted, crushed and sieved to get particles with a size range of 20-40 mesh. 2.2.5. Method E: Cu / Zn / Al co-precipitation by NaeCO ~ The precursor of the catalyst was prepared by simultaneous addition of a mixed aqueous solution of copper, zinc and aluminum nitrates with a total concentration of 1.0 mol/1 and an aqueous solution of sodium carbonate (1.0 tool/l) into a beaker containing a small amount of deionized water. The suspension in the beaker was continuously stirred and kept at a pH range of 7.0 ___ 0.2 and 70 by adjusting the relative flow rate of the two liquids and the heating power. After precipitation, the suspension was aged at the same temper- ature for 1 h while being stirred. The precipitate was washed and then dried at 80 for 12 h. The final stage of the calcination of the precursor was carried out at 450 in an atmosphere of air for 12 h. The atomic ratio of Cu/Zn/A1 was 28 J.-L. Li et aL /Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 23-33 30/15/55. The catalyst powders were tableted, crushed and sieved to get particles with a size range of 20-40 mesh. For convenience, the catalysts prepared by methods A, B, C, D and E are referred to as catalysts A, B, C, D and E, respectively. The dispersion of the oxides in the catalysts was in the order A < B << C < D -- E based on the distance between the oxide particles of the two kinds of the catalysts: methanol synthesis catalysts and methanol dehydration catalysts. This distance in catalyst B was obviously smaller than that in catalyst A because of the smaller particle size. This distance in catalyst C was even smaller because the precipitate (the precursor of the oxides) could form in the pores of 3,-alumina. In catalysts D and E, the precursors of the oxides formed by co-precipitation and therefore the distances among the metal ions were at a molecule level. Therefore the dispersions in catalysts D and E were the highest. 2.3. Characterization of the catalysts The dehydration activity of alumina was measured in a tubular flow reactor (6 mm i.d.) system with superheated methanol vapor as a feed at the normal pressure, 300 and a LHSV of 6 h-1 The hybrid catalysts were evaluated for activity in a tubular flow reactor (6 mm i.d.) system with a feed having a mole composition of He/CO/CO2 = 64/31/5 at 270, 3 MPa (gauge) and a GHSV of 2000 h-1. Before the feed was introduced, the catalysts had been reduced with 5% hydrogen in nitrogen at the normal pressure and a GHSV of 10000 h-1 according to the following heating program: heat up from room temperature to 110 in 1.5 h and allow to stand at the same temperature for 2 h, heat up to 150 in 40 min and allow to stand at the same temperature for 2 h, heat up to 180 in 30 min and allow to stand at the same temperature for 2 h, heat up to 230 in 30 min and allow to stand at the same temperature for 2 h. The BET surface area of alumina and the hybrid catalysts was determined by means of nitrogen adsorption at liquid nitrogen temperature with a computer- manipulated adsorption unit (Series 1800 manufactured by Carlo Erba Sorp- tomatic, Italy). The X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained using a D/Max-RB X-ray diffractometer (Japan made) with Cu K a radiation. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Effect of calcination temperature on alumina The surface area, phase composition and dehydration activity of alumina at different calcination temperatures are listed in Table 2. The data of a commer- J.-L. Li et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 23-33 29 e-, e-, o ,r-' eq e.- [,.. r) .< + r~ .< ,fi k~d [...., i >- g3 ,..d ~5 o 30 J.-L. Li et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 23-33 cial y-alumina (SYYL-3) are also listed for comparison. Along with the rising temperature, bayerite, the product of the precipitate after drying was finally turned to y-alumina via B-alumina as an intermediate. The surface area and dehydration activity increased with rising temperature at first and reached maxima at 550. It seems that fine crystallites of y-alumina are the active phase (The wide XRD peaks of y-alumina presented later showed that the crystallinity of y-alumina was rather poor). The reduction of the surface area and dehydration activity at 650 is probably due to the partial sintering of y-alumina. The dehydration activity of the self-made alumina obtained at calcination temperatures of 550 and 650 was higher than that of the commercial y-alumina. 3.2. Reaction results on the hybrid catalysts The reaction results of the catalysts prepared by different methods are presented in Table 3, where Coo represents CO conversion, So is the selectivity to the organic products (sum of the selectivities to methanol and DME), SD is the percentage of the selectivity of DME in So, YD is the yield of DME. The variation of YD did not quite agree with the order of the dispersion. YD on catalysts C and D were much higher than those on catalysts A and B. This fact can be explained by the enhanced dispersion among CuO, ZnO and y-alumina. The fact that there was no improvement using method B over method A shows that the dispersion of the oxides in catalyst B is still not enough for the synergy among the oxides to occur. YD on catalysts C and D were at the same level. Catalyst E with the highest dispersion among the five provided extremely low DME yield. These unexpected phenomena will be explained below based on the XRD results. 3.3.

This is why only a trace amount of DME is produced in the ordinary methanol synthesis process. In the XRD patterns of catalysts C and D, there are also peaks ascribed to y-alumina (refer to JCPDS 21-10) in addition to the peaks ascribed to CuO and ZnO. However, the amount of y-alumina surviving the preparation procedure in catalyst C was greater than that (produced in calcination of the precipitate) in catalyst D. No peaks ascribed to y-alumina are present in the XRD pattern of catalyst E, in which CuO, ZnO and A1203 are all in the amorphous state. This is consistent with the data of the surface area (113.9, 117.0 and 184.3 mZ/g for catalysts C, D, and E, respectively). The XRD patterns of the precursors of catalysts C, D, and E are presented in Fig. 2. In the precursor of catalyst E, only Cu,Zn-hydrotalcite, (Cu,Zn)6Alz(OH)16CO3 4H20 (refer to JCPDS 37-629), can be observed. In the precursor of catalyst D, in addition to Cu,Zn-hydrotalcite, there still exists bayerite (refer to JCPDS 20-11), which turns to y-alumina upon calcination. In the precursor of catalyst C, besides y-alumina, there are also peaks ascribed to aurichalcite, (Cu,Zn)5(CO3)z(OH)6 (refer to JCPDS 17-743) and rosacite, (Cu,Zn)zCO3(OH)2 (refer to JCPDS 17-216). 3.4. Discussion on active phases From the XRD pattern of the commercial methanol catalyst (Fig. lb), it is reasonable to assume that the active phases for methanol synthesis are highly- 32 J.-L.

Besides the same components as in the commercial methanol catalyst, catalysts C and D also contain fine crystallites of T-alumina, and these two catalysts were the most active for direct synthesis of DME from synthesis gas. So the active phases for DME synthesis can be assumed to be highly-dispersed fine crystallites of Cu, Zn and \"y-A1203. Catalyst E contains neither active phases for methanol synthesis nor active phases for DME synthesis, giving the worst reaction results. The fact that there was little improvement of method D over method C in the DME yield can be explained by the counteraction of the enhanced dispersion of the oxides with the reduction of y-alumina content in catalyst D. 4. Conclusion By means of co-precipitation impregnation and co-precipitation of Cu/Zn by NaA102, active catalysts for direct synthesis of DME from synthesis gas were obtained. The active phases for direct synthesis of DME from synthesis gas are assumed to be highly-dispersed fine crystallites of Cu, Zn and T-AI203. For preparing active alumina for methanol dehydration, the optimum calcina- tion temperature was found to be 550. The active phase for methanol dehydration is fine crystallites of T-alumina. J.-L.

Inui b a Department of Chemistry, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China b Division of Energy and Hydrocarbon Chemistry, Graduate School of Engineering, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-01, Japan * Corresponding author. Based on the knowledge of the mechanisms of methanol synthesis and methanol dehydration, it was predicted that if the dispersion of CuO/ZnO/γ-Al2O3 in hybrid catalysts for direct synthesis of dimethyl ether from synthesis gas was enhanced, the formation rate of dimethyl ether would be increased. In order to justify the prediction, five preparation methods, including two mechanical mixing ones and three co-precipitation ones were used to prepare the catalysts. It was found that co-precipitation impregnation and co-precipitation of Cu/Zn by NaAlO2 provided the catalyst with the highest activity and co-precipitation of Cu/Zn/Al by Na2CO3 resulted in the worst catalyst. Combined with the XRD results it is deduced that the active phases for direct synthesis of dimethyl ether from synthesis gas are highly-dispersed fine crystallites of CuO/ZnO/γ-Al2O3. Calcination temperature of the precursor of γ-alumina used in the methods of mechanical mixing was also studied. It was found that a calcination temperature of 550°C brought about the most active dehydration catalyst with the largest surface area and nearly pure γ-alumina of poor crystallinity. So it might be concluded that the active phase for methanol dehydration is fine crystallites of γ-alumina.
