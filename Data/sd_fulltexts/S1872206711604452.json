The Pd/Ce 0.45 Zr 0.45 La 0.1 O 1.95 three-way catalysts were prepared by the wet impregnation and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, nitrogen adsorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), and oxygen storage capacity. XRD and Raman results showed that the use of ZrOCO 3 or ZrO(NO 3 ) 2 gave a CeO 2 -ZrO 2 mixed oxide with a cubic phase of high thermal stability, while an extra tâ€³-phase was observed in the aged Pd/Ce 0.45 Zr 0.45 La 0.1 O 1.95 catalyst prepared using Zr(NO 3 ) 4 . The activities of the three catalysts were evaluated using simulated exhaust gas under working conditions. The Pd/Ce 0.45 Zr 0.45 La 0.1 O 1.95 catalyst prepared using ZrOCO 3 as precursor gave the best activities for C 3 H 8 , CO, and NO conversion. The use of ZrOCO 3 as precursor was better suited for the formation of Ce 3+ and more favorable for the homogeneous insertion of Zr 4+ and La 3+ into the CeO 2 lattice, which resulted in better thermal stability and enhanced redox properties of the Pd/Ce 0.45 Zr 0.45 La 0.1 O 1.95 catalyst. Key words: oxygen storage material; oxidation-coprecipitation; thermal stability; redox property; three-way activity Automobile exhaust containing carbon monoxide, hydro- carbons, and nitrogen oxides are the major causes of air pollu- tion, and three-way catalysts (TWCs) containing platinum group metals (Pt, Pd, and Rh) have received considerable at- tention for their purification. However, the pollutants can be together converted to harmless gases only if the air/fuel ratio is kept at around 14.6, which are lean fuel conditions [1]. Sig- nificant improvements in catalytic performance in a wider range of the air/fuel ratio have been achieved by incorporating CeO 2 into TWCs, which can act as an oxygen buffer for storing and releasing oxygen under lean and rich conditions, respec- tively [1ï€­3]. However, pure CeO 2 will sinter at high temperatures, lead- ing to a decrease in surface area and oxygen storage capacity (OSC). As a result, the catalyst performance will be severely degraded. In order to enhance thermal stability and retain the OSC of CeO 2 , many binary materials, including CeO 2 -ZrO 2 , CeO 2 -Y 2 O 3 , CeO 2 -La 2 O 3 , and CeO 2 -Al 2 O 3 , have been exten- sively investigated [2â€“9]. Among the tested materials, the CeO 2 -ZrO 2 mixed oxide showed outstanding thermal stability and excellent redox properties, and its study has been an im- portant direction of TWC development [1]. The thermal stability and redox properties of CeO 2 -ZrO 2 can be enhanced by incorporating foreign ions such as Y 3+ [2,3], La 3+ [4], Al 3+ [5], and Sr 2+ [6] into its lattice. In particular, the adding of an appropriate amount of Y 3+ and La 3+ into a CeO 2 -ZrO 2 mixed oxide promotes the homogeneous distribu- tion of Ce and Zr on the atomic level, creates more defects, and enhances the redox ability. On the other hand, the properties of the materials are also determined by the preparation route. Many methods have been investigated to form CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -based materials with improved thermal stability and durability [2ï€­18]. These include the precipitation method, sol-gel technique, hydrothermal route, high energy milling, and surfactant-assisted approaches. A requirement for an effective way to prepare the materials is that it should be suitable for large scale production application, thus the precipitation method is widely adopted because of its practicability. CHEN Shanhu et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1762â€“1771 The choice of starting materials also plays an important role in determining the properties of the product. A simple copre- cipitation method using (NH 4 ) 2 Ce(NO 3 ) 6 and ZrO(NO 3 ) 2 as cerium and zirconium precursors, respectively, was first em- ployed by Hori et al. [7] to synthesize CeO 2 -ZrO 2 . The mixed oxide was successfully obtained by calcining the hydroxide at 500 o C. Rossingol et al. [8] found that a CeO 2 -ZrO 2 solid so- lution could not be formed when Ce(NO 3 ) 3 was used as the cerium precursor, and two separated phases of cubic CeO 2 and tetragonal ZrO 2 were present in the final sample. Letichevsky et al. [9] have studied the role of preparation conditions on the performance of the CeO 2 -ZrO 2 samples and observed that the cerium precursor was the most important experimental pa- rameter because it determined the existing phases and conse- quently the redox properties. Since the 1980s, the H 2 O 2 -assisted precipitation method has been widely used by many researchers to prepare CeO 2 -based materials [10ï€­12]. It has been disclosed that H 2 O 2 can oxidize Ce(III) to Ce(IV) in the presence of ammonia. The interaction of Ce 3+ , Zr 4+ , and H 2 O 2 facilitates the formation of a CeO 2 -ZrO 2 solid solution after thermal treatment [12]. However, no sys- tematic research has been carried out to evaluate the influence of different zirconium precursors in the H 2 O 2 -assisted method. In this work, three different zirconium precursors were em- ployed to synthesize a Ce 0.45 Zr 0.45 La 0.1 O 1.95 support material to find the best zirconium precursor for Ce 0.45 Zr 0.45 La 0.1 O 1.95 in the H 2 O 2 -assited precipitation method. The textural, structural, and redox properties of the Pd/Ce 0.45 Zr 0.45 La 0.1 O 1.95 catalysts and the catalytic activities for C 3 H 8 , CO, and NO conversion were investigated and correlated. 1 Experimental 1.1 Preparation of Ce 0.45 Zr 0.45 La 0.1 O 1.95 All the supports in this work had the same nominal compo- sition of Ce 0.45 Zr 0.45 La 0.1 O 1.95 . The Ce 0.45 Zr 0.45 La 0.1 O 1.95 oxide was prepared by the H 2 O 2 -assisted precipitation method. First, ZrOCO 3 was dissolved by concentrated nitric acid. The molar ratio of ZrOCO 3 :HNO 3 was 1:1. Then the required amounts of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 and La(NO 3 ) 3 were added under continuous stirring. Finally, a H 2 O 2 solution of 30 wt% was introduced. The molar ratio of Ce:H 2 O 2 was 1:1.5. After stirring for at least 1 h, an ammonia solution was added dropwise until the pH was 10. The precipitate was filtered, washed with distilled water till no pH change could be detected and then dried at 80 o C for 5 h. Finally, the sample was calcined at 600 o C for 3 h to get the fresh support, named CeZr1-F. The other two samples, using ZrO(NO 3 ) 2 or Zr(NO 3 ) 4 as precursors, were also prepared according to this procedure. The products were labeled CeZr2-F and CeZr3-F, respectively. For the heat treatment, the fresh samples were calcined at 1000 o C for 5 h to produce the aged oxides, which were denoted CeZr1-A, CeZr2-A, and CeZr3-A. 1.2 Catalyst preparation The supported Pd catalysts with the fresh supports were prepared by the incipient impregnation method using Pd(NO 3 ) 2 as Pd metal precursor. The Pd loading was 0.5 wt%. The sam- ples obtained were dried at 120 o C for 12 h and calcined at 550 o C for 3 h. The powder was mixed with distilled water to pre- pare a slurry with 40 wt% solid content, which was coated onto cylindrical cordierite monoliths (Corning, USA, 400 cells/in 2 ). The loading of washcoat was 140 g/L. The catalysts were dried at 120 Â°C for 12 h and calcined at 550 Â°C for 3 h to get the fresh samples. These samples were denoted as Pd/CeZr1-F, Pd/CeZr2-F, and Pd/CeZr3-F. Finally, the fresh samples were further aged at 1000 Â°C for 5 h in air to get aged catalysts, which were labeled as Pd/CeZr1-A, Pd/CeZr2-A, and Pd/CeZr3-A. 1.3 Catalytic activity measurement The catalytic activity was measured in a fixed bed reactor. The simulated exhaust gas consisted of 8% NO, 6% C 3 H 8 , 0.86% CO, 12% CO 2 , and 10% H 2 O balanced with N 2 . The space velocity was 34000 h ï€­1 . C 3 H 8 , CO, and NO in the effluent were analyzed using a FGA-4100 analyzer (Foshan Analytical Instrument Co., LTD. China). The Î» value, which was defined as the ratio between available oxygen and oxygen needed for the complete conversion of C 3 H 8 , CO, and NO, was expressed as Î» = (2[O 2 ] + [NO])/(10[C 3 H 8 ] + [CO]). The amount of oxygen was controlled to give Î» = 1 for the catalytic activity measurements. Prior to the measurement, the catalyst was treated under the reaction atmosphere at 550 Â°C for at least 1 h to ensure stable operation. The light-off performance was recorded by increasing the temperature stepwise from room temperature to 500 Â°C. At each point the temperature was maintained constant for at least 10 min. 1.4 Characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku DX-2500 diffractometer with Cu K Î± (40 kV, 200 mA). The data were collected from 10Â° to 90Â° with a step size of 0.03Â°. Raman spectroscopy was carried out on a LabRAM HR800 instrument with a diode laser source at a laser power of 150 mW. A frequency range of 200ï€­2000 cm ï€­1 was recorded. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were carried out with a XSAM 800 spectrometer (KRATOS Corp.) with Mg K Î± radiation (13 kV, 20 mA). The binding energy (BE) of C 1s from carbon deposit was taken as reference and it was set to 284.6 eV to correct for charging effects. CHEN Shanhu et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1762â€“1771 The BET (Brunauer-Emmet-Teller) surface area and Bar- rett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution were obtained on a Quantachrome SI instrument. Prior to the measurement, the samples were degassed under vacuum at 300 o C for 3 h. Oxygen storage capacity (OSC) experiments were performed by oxygen pulse injection technique at 200 o C over samples previously reduced in H 2 stream of 30 ml/min at 550 o C for 1 h. The oxygen consumption was monitored by a TCD detector. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was conducted using a TCD detector with a U-tube containing 100 mg of sample. The samples were pretreated under flowing N 2 of 30 ml/min at 450 o C for 1 h and then cooled to room temperature. A reducing gas of 10% H 2 /Ar of 30 ml/min was switched into the system and the temperature was raised from room tem- perature to 900 o C at a constant heating rate of 10 o C /min. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 XRD characterization The XRD patterns of the fresh and aged catalysts are shown in Fig. 1. The main peaks at 2Î¸ = 29.1 o in the XRD patterns are the characteristic features of the cubic fluorite structure. No peak due to ZrO 2 or La 2 O 3 was observed, which indicated that the Zr 4+ and La 3+ ions were incorporated into the CeO 2 lattice to form a solid solution [13]. It has been reported that a CeO 2 -ZrO 2 mixed oxide prepared by the coprecipitation method using Ce 3+ as the cerium precursor shows structural heterogeneity, whereas a CeO 2 -ZrO 2 solid solution is obtained when H 2 O 2 is added into the mixed oxide reaction solution [9,14]. Therefore, our present result is in good agreement with previous works in the references. The CeO 2 -ZrO 2 phases are determined by the CeO 2 content. In the intermediate region, the nature of the CeO 2 -ZrO 2 phase present is still under debate because of the presence of several metastable phases with tetragonal symmetry [15]. However, in this work, no tetragonal phase was observed although the molar ratio of Ce/Zr was 1:1, which indicated that the doping with La 3+ enhanced the thermal stability of the cubic structure [9]. It was noted that the peak position of the sample prepared with ZrOCO 3 was shifted to a higher angle as compared with those prepared with ZrO(NO 3 ) 2 and Zr(NO 3 ) 4 , thus the diffraction angles of the peaks followed the sequence of Pd/CeZr1-F > Pd/CeZr2-F > Pd/CeZr3-F. However, the particle sizes of the samples calculated from the XRD peak (Table 1) were in the order of Pd/CeZr1-F < Pd/CeZr2-F < Pd/CeZr3-F. We con- cluded that the use of different zirconium precursors led to differences on the crystal lattice level. The insertion of Zr 4+ cations into CeO 2 -ZrO 2 decreased its crystal parameter because the ionic radius of Zr 4+ (0.084 nm) is smaller than that of Ce 4+ (0.097 nm). The use of ZrOCO 3 facilitated the insertion of Zr 4+ into the CeO 2 -ZrO 2 lattice. This was further confirmed by XPS measurements presented in the following section. As expected and shown in Fig. 1, after calcination at 1000 o C for 5 h, the oxides retained the cubic structure. However, the intensity of the XRD peaks became sharper, indicating the formation of larger crystallites caused by sintering. The aver- age crystallite size of the aged samples was much larger than that of the fresh samples (Table 1). For the fresh samples, the particle size was almost constant, but after aging the particle sizes for Pd/CeZr1-A, Pd/CeZr2-A, and Pd/CeZr3-A increased to 10.1, 10.8, and 11.8 nm, respectively. The increase in crys- tallite size followed the sequence of Pd/CeZr3-A (151%) > Pd/CeZr2-A (130%) > Pd/CeZr1-A (115%), implying that the catalyst prepared with ZrOCO 3 possessed the highest thermal stability. It was also noted that the crystal parameters of Pd/CeZr1-F 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 8010 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 (b) I n t e s i t y 2ï�±ï€¯ï€¨ï€ ï�¯ ï€ ï€© Pd/CeZr3-A Pd/CeZr2-A Pd/CeZr1-A I n t e s i t y 2ï�±ï€¯ï€¨ï€ ï�¯ ï€ ï€© Pd/CeZr3-F Pd/CeZr2-F Pd/CeZr1-F (a) Fig. 1.

From the fact that the radius of Ce 4+ is larger than Zr 4+ and smaller than La 3+ , we deduced that enrichment of La 3+ at the surface of CeO 2 -ZrO 2 was the determining factor that caused the lattice shrinkage. On the other hand, the con- centrations of oxygen vacancies and Ce 3+ ions decreased with increasing crystallite size, inducing more Ce 3+ (0.114 nm) to transform to Ce 4+ (0.097 nm), which was the likely reason for the shrinkage of lattice parameter. In the case of Pd/CeZr3-A, the lattice parameter of the unit cell remained at almost the same value as Pd/CeZr3-F, which may be due to the balance between the agglomeration of Zr 4+ and the extraction of La 3+ from the bulk lattice. This was supported by the XPS results. 2.2 Raman spectrometry The Raman spectra of the samples are shown in Fig. 2. The spectra were quite similar and were dominated by an intense absorption band at 470 cm ï€­1 with a weak band at 615 cm ï€­1 for the fresh samples (Fig. 2(a)). Only a band at 460 cm ï€­1 due to the fundamental F 2g mode vibration of the fluorite-type structure can be observed with pure CeO 2 . However, some literature reports said this band actually occurs at 464 cm ï€­1 for CeO 2 -based materials [16]. Therefore, the strong absorption line at 470 cm ï€­1 was assigned to the symmetric breathing mode of the oxygen atoms around the cerium ions. After aging at 1000 o C, the peak became intense (Fig. 2(b)), which was due to the better crystallization of the CeO 2 -ZrO 2 solid solution cal- cined at the higher temperature. This was in agreement with the XRD results. In addition, as shown in Fig. 2, the intensity of this band in the different samples followed the sequence of Pd/CeZr3 > Pd/CeZr2 > Pd/CeZr1, indicating that the catalyst prepared with ZrOCO 3 had a relatively smaller crystallite size as compared with the others. This was another piece of evi- dence that demonstrated that the Pd/CeZr1-F catalyst had the highest thermal stability. The side band at 615 cm ï€­1 was at- tributed to oxygen vacancies induced by the presence of a defective structure in doped CeO 2 materials [17]. The intensity of the Raman spectra is affected by many factors, including particle size, morphology, and structure. With the increase of the calcination temperature, aggregation of the Zr-rich phase at the surface occurred, which was responsible for the shift of the band at 470 cm ï€­1 to lower values, as shown in Fig. 2(b). However, the vibration frequency of Pd/CeZr1-A was obvi- ously higher than those of Pd/CeZr2-A and Pd/CeZr3-A, which implied that an improved insertion ability of ZrO 2 into the bulk of CeO 2 was achieved in the case of using ZrOCO 3 . Further- more, an extra band at 300 cm ï€­1 was seen with Pd/CeZr3-A, which was attributed to the displacement of oxygen anions from their ideal fluorite positions, and indicated the segrega- tion of the tâ€³ phase in the lattice of the CeO 2 -ZrO 2 solid solu- tion. However, this metastable tâ€³ phase cannot be effectively detected by the XRD technique due to the weak diffraction of oxygen atoms. The crystalline CeO 2 -ZrO 2 solid solutions can be expected to be the monoclinic, tetragonal, or cubic phase, depending on the cerium content and calcination temperature, as reported in Ref. [15]. Accordingly, homogeneous CeO 2 -ZrO 2 solid solutions can only be detected when the ZrO 2 molar percentage is > 50 mol%. In the present work, no extra peak ascribable to tetragonal ZrO 2 was observed, suggesting that the insertion of trivalent La 3+ cations into the CeO 2 -ZrO 2 lattice improved the phase stability of the CeO 2 -ZrO 2 solid solution. The intensity of the band at 615 cm ï€­1 decreased in the order of Pd/CeZr1-A > Pd/CeZr2-A > Pd/CeZr3-A, which indicated that the defects in the sample prepared with ZrOCO 3 were better preserved during calcination. 2.3 XPS characterization XPS measurements were carried out to investigate the sur- face elemental distribution and oxidation state of the cerium element of the catalyst. As illustrated in Fig. 3, there were eight peaks in the Ce 3d spectra corresponding to four pairs of spin-orbit doublets. The peaks labeled with â€œuâ€� and â€œVâ€� were 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800200 300 400 500 600 700 800 302 Raman shift (cm ï€­1 ) 615 470 Pd/CeZr3-A Pd/CeZr2-A I n t e n s i t y Raman shift (cm ï€­1 ) Pd/CeZr1-A (b) I n t e n s i t y Pd/CeZr3-F Pd/CeZr2-F Pd/CeZr1-F 470 615 (a) Fig. 2.

The peaks labeled (V 0 , u 0 ), (V 2 , u 2 ), and (V 3 , u 3 ) were attributed to the states of Ce 4+ , while the doublet (V 1 , u 1 ) was due to Ce 3+ . The XPS spectra disclosed the coexistence of Ce 3+ and Ce 4+ oxidation states in all the catalyst samples. The proportion of Ce 3+ was calculated from the ratio of the areas of Ce 3+ species to the sum of areas of all the cerium species (Table 2). The proportion of Ce 3+ in the aged catalyst was lower than that in the fresh catalyst, which was caused by the oxidation of Ce 3+ to Ce 4+ during the calcination in air [16]. For both the fresh and aged catalysts, the concentration of Ce 3+ ions decreased in the order of Pd/CeZr1 > Pd/CeZr2 > Pd/CeZr3. In addition, by comparing the contents of the different ele- ments, we concluded that the ratios of Zr and La on the surface of Pd/CeZr2-F and Pd/CeZr3-F were higher than those of Pd/CeZr1-F, indicating that the most homogeneous distribution of Ce, Zr, and La was in the Pd/CeZr1-F catalyst. This provided the interpretation for why the highest Ce 3+ content was present in Pd/CeZr1-F, because the formation of a homogeneous CeO 2 -ZrO 2 solid solution facilitated the reduction of Ce 4+ to Ce 3+ or the formation of oxygen vacancies [18]. Moreover, the surface Pd content of Pd/CeZr1-F was also higher than those of Pd/CeZr2-F and Pd/CeZr3-F, indicating that its Pd dispersion was higher than the others. On the other hand, after calcination at 1000 o C, an evident migration of Zr and La to the surface was observed, implying that a â€œshell-coreâ€� structure with a Zr-La-rich composition in the outer layer has been formed [18]. This new structure cannot be detected by XRD analysis be- cause the crystallographic structure and orientation of the atomic planes are almost the same for the inner and outer re- gions of the crystallite. The Pd surface concentration for Pd/CeZr1-A was the largest among the catalysts, and its extent of decrease before and after aging was the lowest, suggesting that the use of ZrOCO 3 helped prevent Pd species from sin- tering and encapsulation. 2.4 Textural properties The textural properties of the catalysts are listed in Table 3. All the fresh samples showed good textural properties with surface area and pore volume in excess of 100 m 2 /g and 0.25 cm 3 /g, respectively. The specific surface area and pore volume of the fresh samples were in the order of Pd/CeZr1-F > Pd/CeZr2-F > Pd/CeZr3-F, although the differences between them were not large. However, after calcination at 1000 o C, the differences between the different catalysts became remarkable. For example, the surface area and pore volume of Pd/CeZr1-A were 42 m 2 /g and 0.21 cm 3 /g, respectively, which were about twice those of Pd/CeZr3-A. The decrease in surface area and pore volume after calcination resulted from sintering at high temperature. The results showed that the textural properties were related to the zirconium precursor and indicated that the Zr precursor played an important role in the preparing of 930 920 910 900 890 880 930 920 910 900 890 880 Binding energy (eV) Binding energy (eV) (b) I n t e n s i t y Pd/CeZr1-A Pd/CeZr2-A Pd/CeZr3-A V 0 V 1 V 2 u 0 u 2 u 1 u 3 V 3 V 0 V 1 V 2 u 0 u 2 u 1 (a) Pd/CeZr1-F Pd/CeZr2-F I n t e n s i t y Pd/CeZr3-F u 3 V 3 Fig. 3.

The formation of a homogenous CeO 2 -ZrO 2 solution facilitates thermal stability during calci- nation. In this work, the use of different zirconium precursors led to different atomic distributions of Ce, Zr, and La, which were responsible for their differences in textural properties. N 2 adsorption isotherms and pore size distributions of the fresh and aged samples are shown in Fig. 4. The isotherms of the Pd/CeZr1-F and Pd/CeZr2-F samples were Type IV with H 2 hysteresis, which is characteristic of mesoporous materials [19]. For Pd/CeZr3-F, the isotherm was Type II with H3 hys- teresis, suggesting the presence of ill-defined pseudo-mesopores [20]. The isotherm of Pd/CeZr3-A dis- played the same characteristics as those of Pd/CeZr1-A and Pd/CeZr2-A, implying that rearrangement of the pore structure of Pd/CeZr3-F occurred during aging. The pore size followed the sequence of Pd/CeZr1-F > Pd/CeZr2-F > Pd/CeZr3-F. After aging, the pore size distribution became wider because the sintering of mesoporous materials led to the elimination of small pores and formation of larger ones [18]. The growth rate of the pore size increased in the order of Pd/CeZr1-A < Pd/CeZr2-A < Pd/CeZr3-A, suggesting that the pore structure of Pd/CeZr1-F was thermally the most stable. From the viewpoint of pore structure, we attributed the excellent textural stability of Pd/CeZr1-F to its enlarged pore size. It has been reported that due to the need for long range migration, CeO 2 -based materials with a larger pore size are difficult to sinter during thermal treatment. 2.5 H 2 -TPR analysis The reduction of the CeO 2 -based materials used for TWCs is a crucial factor. Figure 5 displays the H 2 -TPR profiles of the fresh and aged oxides. All the oxide samples showed a con- tinuous reduction process consisting of an intense peak cen- tered at 500 o C and an additional shoulder centered at 350 o C in the lower temperature region. The peak at 500 o C was associ- ated with the reduction of CeO 2 -ZrO 2 . The shoulder at the lower temperature was ascribed to the reduction of surface adsorbed oxygen species or CeO 2 -rich nanocrystallites dis- persed at the interface of the mixed oxides crystallites [21]. The crystallite surface contains different O 2ï€­ ions with different coordination numbers. The surface of the oxide has defective structures such as steps, kinks, corners, and faces projecting O 2ï€­ ions, which increase with surface area. The reducibility of these O 2ï€­ species would be different, resulting in the shoulders 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 -40 0 40 80 120 160 200 0 2 4 6 8 101214 0.00 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 0 40 80 120 160 200 240 0 102030405060 0.000 0.005 0.010 0.015 0.020 0.025 Pd/CeZr1-A Pd/CeZr2-A Pd/CeZr3-A p/p 0 V ( N 2 ) / ( c m 3 / g ) (b) d V / d r ( c m 3 ï€¯ ( g ïƒ— n m ) ) Pore radius (nm) p/p 0 V ( N 2 ) / ( c m 3 / g ) Pd/CeZr1-F Pd/CeZr2-F Pd/CeZr3-F (a) d V / d r ( c m 3 / ( g ïƒ— n m ) Pore radius (nm) Fig. 4.

H 2 -TPR profiles of fresh (a) and aged (b) oxides. CHEN Shanhu et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1762â€“1771 in the profiles. The reduction profile of CeO 2 usually shows two separate reduction steps, which were not observed in the present work. This was possibly because the high temperature reduction peak due to the bulk reduction of CeO 2 has disappeared. We deduced that the mobility of bulk oxygen species has been greatly im- proved by the high homogeneity of the CeO 2 -ZrO 2 solid solu- tion. The insertion of the trivalent cations, La 3+ , into the lattice of the CeO 2 -ZrO 2 solid solution improved the oxygen storage capacity at low temperature by decreasing the onset of the reduction of the bulk of the solid solution as compared with the undoped case. Consequently, the removal of oxygen species occurs concurrently both at the surface and in the bulk of the mixed oxide. The reduction onset of CeZr1 was lower than those of CeZr2 and CeZr3, which might originate from its larger surface area because the surface reduction of CeO 2 -ZrO 2 was expected to be correlated to its surface area [22]. Signifi- cant changes in reducibility occurred for the aged supports. As discussed above, the surface area decreased much after aging, and the mobility of the surface oxygen species was also much suppressed. On the other hand, the reduction of the bulk oxy- gen species mainly depended on the crystalline structure. The progressively increasing amounts of ZrO 2 and La 2 O 3 inserted into the CeO 2 fluorite lattice enlarged the channel diameter for oxygen migration and increased structural defects, thus im- proving the reduction ability [23]. After aging, the migration of ZrO 2 and La 2 O 3 from the bulk to the surface occurred, which degraded the mobility of lattice oxygen. Figure 6 shows the H 2 -TPR profiles of the catalysts before and after aging. All the fresh catalysts exhibited one intense peak (Î±) with a weak shoulder peak (Î²). According to the lit- erature [18], the dominant Î± peak can be attributed to the re- duction of highly dispersed PdO x species, while Î² peak can be assigned to the reduction of stable PdO x species. However, another possibility that involves stepwise reduction, i.e., the reduction of PdO to Pd 2 O and the further reduction of Pd 2 O to Pd cannot be excluded [24]. It should be pointed out that the consumption of hydrogen was much more than the nominal value. Considering the low loading of Pd, we speculated that the support also took part in the reduction process. This could occur because the presence of a noble metal could promote the removal of the interfacial oxygen species [25]. Two other weak peaks (Î´ and Îµ) in the range of 250ï€­400 o C were also observed, which might be due to the reduction of surface/subsurface oxygen species. The reduction area of the samples decreased in the order of Pd/CeZr1-F > Pd/CeZr2-F > Pd/CeZr3-F, while the reduction onset was in the opposite order, indicating that the use of ZrOCO 3 was the best precursor with regard to the re- duction of the catalyst. In the case of the aged catalysts (Fig. 6(b)), the intensity of Î±' decreased significantly with respect to that of Î±, which was probably due to agglomeration of PdO x particles caused by sintering or encapsulation [18]. Likewise, the Î²' peak might be due to surface/subsurface oxygen species from the support. Again the catalyst obtained using ZrOCO 3 had the best re- ducibility. Interestingly, an extra negative feature (Î³) appeared in all the H 2 -TPR profiles. This was induced by the decompo- sition of PdH x , indicating the dissociation of hydrogen initiated by Pd at low temperature [25]. 2.6 OSC measurements The OSC values of the fresh and aged samples are shown in Fig. 7. For both the fresh and aged samples, the O 2 uptake followed the order of Pd/CeZr1 > Pd/CeZr2 > Pd/CeZr3. As shown by the XPS results, obvious segregation of Zr and La was observed on the surface of the samples except for Pd/CeZr1, indicating that Pd/CeZr1 has the most homogeneous structure, which would be responsible for its improved OSC. The OSC was also related to the surface area when this was lower than 50 m 2 /g, while the diffusion of oxygen from the bulk became the controlling step for high surface area CeO 2 -ZrO 2 [27]. The surface areas of all the fresh samples were close to each other, thus, the OSC values were almost the same. After aging, the differences were distinct, which con- tributed to the differences of the OSC values.

We also observed that Pd/CeZr1-A showed the highest OSC value among all the aged catalysts, which was attributed to its highest thermal stability. 2.7 Three-way catalytic activity The conversions of C 3 H 8 , NO, and CO and light-off tem- perature (T 50 ) and complete conversion temperature (T 90 ) over the different catalysts are presented in Fig. 8 and Table 4. The Pd/CeZr1-F catalyst gave the best catalytic performance be- cause its T 50 and T 90 for all the pollutants were the lowest among the tested fresh samples. Furthermore, the difference between T 90 and T 50 of Pd/CeZr1-F was the smallest, indicating that the catalyst could rapidly initiate and complete the reac- tions, which was very important to effectively purify pollutants produced in the cold start stage of the automobile. In addition, as compared with an earlier work [28], the Pd/CeZr1 catalyst even showed a better catalytic activity than the Pd/CZLA catalyst. Previous studies [13,25] have disclosed that the re- duction of surface PdO x species, which were denoted as the Î± 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Pd/CeZr3 Pd/CeZr2Pd/CeZr1 O 2 u p t a k e ( ï�­ m o l / g ) fresh aged Fig. 7.

Catalytic activities of fresh (a, c, and e) and aged (b, d, and f) catalysts. CHEN Shanhu et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1762â€“1771 and Î² features in the present work, played an important role in CO and HC oxidation. As for NO conversion, oxygen vacan- cies associated with the Ce 3+ cations adjacent to the noble metal particles were supposed to be the active sites. Thus the abun- dant content of Ce 3+ in Pd/CeZr1-F, as shown by Raman results, resulted in its superior efficiency for NO conversion. Based on the above analysis, the best redox property of the Pd/CeZr1-F catalyst was mainly responsible for its best catalytic perform- ance. In the case of the aged catalysts, a large drop of the three-way activity was observed, which was attributed to the degraded structure and the sintering of the Pd component [13]. The sequence of catalytic activity of the aged catalysts was the same as that of the fresh ones. Apart from the reduction prop- erty, the structural and textural properties should also been taken into account due to the high space velocity. A careful comparison of the OSC values and catalytic behavior of the aged catalysts indicated that the influence of OSC capacity could not be neglected. In the practical operation of a gasoline engine, the air/fuel ratio exhibits a slight oscillation around the stoichiometric point. Therefore, the OSC capacity is expected to be a crucial actor that determines the overall performance of the TWC. 3 Conclusions The zirconium precursor played an important role in deter- mining the catalytic performance of a Pd/Ce 0.45 Zr 0.45 La 0.1 O 1.95 three-way catalyst. The use of ZrOCO 3 or ZrO(NO 3 ) 2 as Zr precursor gave Ce 0.45 Zr 0.45 La 0.1 O 1.95 mixed oxides with the cubic phase, while an extra tâ€³ phase was observed when Zr(NO 3 ) 4 was used as the Zr precursor. The Pd/Ce 0.45 Zr 0.45 La 0.1 O 1.95 catalyst prepared using ZrOCO 3 as Zr precursor exhibited the best textural, structural, and redox properties as well as the highest catalytic activity for the con- version of C 3 H 8 , CO, and NO. This was due to its having the most homogenous distribution of Ce, Zr, and La on the atomic level. In the oxidation-precipitation method, H 2 O 2 gave some interaction between cerium and zirconium species, and the use of ZrOCO 3 resulted in zirconium species that best matched cerium species, which might be the reason for the formation of the homogeneous mixed oxide.

Tel/Fax: +86-28-85418451 Three types of Ce0.45Zr0.45La0.1O1.95 mixed oxides were prepared by H2O2-assisted precipitation using ZrOCO3, ZrO(NO3)2, and Zr(NO3)4 as precursors. The Pd/Ce0.45Zr0.45La0.1O1.95 three-way catalysts were prepared by the wet impregnation and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, nitrogen adsorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), and oxygen storage capacity. XRD and Raman results showed that the use of ZrOCO3 or ZrO(NO3)2 gave a CeO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide with a cubic phase of high thermal stability, while an extra t″-phase was observed in the aged Pd/Ce0.45Zr0.45La0.1O1.95 catalyst prepared using Zr(NO3)4. The activities of the three catalysts were evaluated using simulated exhaust gas under working conditions. The Pd/Ce0.45Zr0.45La0.1O1.95 catalyst prepared using ZrOCO3 as precursor gave the best activities for C3H8, CO, and NO conversion. The use of ZrOCO3 as precursor was better suited for the formation of Ce3+ and more favorable for the homogeneous insertion of Zr4+ and La3+ into the CeO2 lattice, which resulted in better thermal stability and enhanced redox properties of the Pd/Ce0.45Zr0.45La0.1O1.95 catalyst. 摘要 报道了温和条件下甘油和碳酸二甲酯在一系列碱性催化剂作用下合成碳酸甘油酯的活性规律和构效关系. 结果表明, 在所选择的催化剂中, NaY 分子筛对目标反应具有较高的活性和最高的目的产物选择性; 另外, 甘油和碳酸二甲酯的反应对催化剂的孔道结构具有特殊的要求, 3A, 4A 和 NaZSM-5 等孔径较小 (< 0.6 nm) 的分子筛没有催化活性, 而孔径较大的 NaY 和 Naβ 则表现出较高的催化活性. Graphical abstract The use of ZrOCO3 gave a pure fluorite structure with better insertion of Zr4+ and La3+ into the CeO2 lattice, and Pd supported on it gave superior three-way catalyst performance.
