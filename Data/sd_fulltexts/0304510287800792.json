ORO, MARINA CAMPO and DANIEL CARMONA Departamento de Quimica Inorgdnica, Institute de Ciencia de Materiales de Arag6n, Universidad de Zaragoza-Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, 50009 Saragassa (Spain) (Received May 20,1986; accepted September 23,1986) Summary Olefins are hydrogenated under ambient conditions in propan-2-ol with [{Rh(C5Mes)Cl}2(^-Cl)2] in the presence of pyrazole-type ligands and bases; the optimum homogeneous system contains |[{Rh(CsMes)Cl}20(-Cl)2] + 2HMe2pz + 2EtaN. The complex [{R^CsMesMHMezpz^M-O^a] (04)2 is an effective olefin hydrogenation catalyst which functions well in the absence of base. The catalytic activity of related mono- and binuclear rho- dium complexes with pyrazole or pyrazolate-type ligands is compared. Introduction Some T^-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl-rhodium complexes show good activity as olefin hydrogenation catalysts [1-3]. They are soluble in polar solvents and thermally stable. The activity is higher in weakly coordinating polar solvents such as propan-2-ol, and catalysis by the halide complexes [{M(CsMes)Cl}2(/i-Cl)2] (M = Rh, Ir) is strongly cocatalyzed by organic bases such as Et3N. The indium complexes, however, caused isomerization of ole- fins to occur much more rapidly than did the rhodium complexes [1, 2]. We have recently reported some unusual binuclear rhodium pyrazolate complexes containing the pentamethylcyclopentadienyl group and hydroxo- or methoxo-bridging ligands [4]. We have examined the activity of a number of catalytic systems containing pyrazole or pyrazolate-type ligands* and we now report our results.

For comparison, the initial rates of hydrogenation were also measured for complex (1) itself in the presence triethylamine, under similar conditions. The catalytic activities are affected by the pyrazole- type ligand and the base used. The activity decreases in the order HMe2pz > HMepz > Hpz and EtaN > KOH, and is highest for the combination [{Rh(C5Me5)Cl} 2(^1-01)2] + 2HMe2pz + 2EtsN. Its rate of reaction is similar to that found for (1) + EtaN, and under our conditions, both systems are substantially better than catalysts based on [{Rh(CsMe5)} 2(^-0^)3]+. Chem- ical studies [4, 5] on the system derived from [{Rh(C5Me5)Cl} 2(^-01)2] + 2HMe2pz + 2EtaN suggest the in situ formation of [{Rh(C5Me5)- (HMe2pz)}2(^-OH)2]2\"1'. However the activity of the [{R^CsMes^r^-C^] + 2HMezpz + 2Et3N is higher than that observed for the isolated perchlorate complex [{Rh(C5Mes)(HMe2pz)}2(At-OH)2] (0104)2 [4] either in the presence or in the absence of triethylamine. The ability of the above-mentioned catalysts to reduce hex-1-ene has also been examined (Table 2). The most active catalytic system seems to be (1) + EtaN, followed by the di-^-hydroxo complex [{Rh(C5Mes)(HMe2pz)}2- (JU-OH)2] (0104)2 (2). However, (2) functions under our conditions as an effi- cient homogeneous catalyst towards olefins, whereas the most active com- bination of (1) + Et3N gave rise to some rhodium metal under our conditions, which was probably the cause of the high rate. On addition of further olefin (hex-1-ene or cyclohexene) to the solution of complex (2) and rehydrogena- tion, the activity rate of hydrogen uptake was found to decrease to ca. 20% for cyclohexene. The activity of (2) is highest in propan-2-ol (25 cm3 min\"1 343 TABLE 2 Hydrogenation of hex-1-ene (3.0 mmol) at 1 atm and 40 C in propan-2-ol (10 cm3) Catalyst precursor (0.02 mmol) Initial rate\" [ Rh(C5Me5)Cl}2(M-Cl)2] + EtaN (3.6 mmol) 113 [ Rh(C5Me5)Cl}2(JLl-Cl)2] + 2HMe2pz + 2Et3N 29 [ Rh(C5Me5)}2(JU-OH)3]d04 1 [ Rh(CsMe5)(HMe2pz) 2(At-OH)2] (04)2 25 [ Rh(CsMe5)(HMe2pz) 20-t-OH)2](C104)2 + NaCI 18 [ Rh(C5Me5)(HMe2pz) 2(M-OH)2](C104)2+ 2HMe2pz 11 [ Rh(C5Mes)(HMe2pz) 2(JU-OH)2](C104)2 + 2EtsN 5 [ Rh(C5Me5)(HMePhpz)}2(jU-OH)2](C104)2 6 [ Rh(C5Me5)}2(JU-Me2pz)(Al-OMe)2]C104 20 [ Rh(C5Mes)}2(iU-pz)(JLl-OMe)2]C104 1 \"Initial rate = cm3 (min X mmol Rh)~1.

Addition of chloride ions as NaCI, of HMeapz, or of EtaN to (2) decreased the activity further. The related di-JU-hydroxo complex [{Rh^CsMesKHMePhpz^Ai-OH);] (0104)2 (where HMePhpz = 3(5)-methyl-5(3)phenylpyrazole) [4] is consider- ably less active than (2). The di'/x-methoxodimethylpyrazolato-bridged complex [{Rh(C5Me5)}2(At-Me2pz)(jit-OMe)2](C104)2 was also active, although the parent di-JU-methoxopyrazolate compound was almost inactive. Previous kinetic studies [1] on hydrogenation in the presence of (1) suggest that monomeric species containing C5Me5 Rh(I) and/or -(III) moie- ties are involved. In an effort to understand how complex (2) functions as a catalyst, we have tried to isolate some intermediates. These attempts have not been successful, but there must be some substantial differences in the catalytic cycle of (2) compared to that of (l);thus for example (2) isomerizes TABLE 3 Hydrogenation of hexenes using [{Rh(C5Mes)(HMe2pz)}2(JU-OH)2](C104)2 and l{Rh(C5Mes)Cl}2(JLi-Cl)2] + EtaN in propan-2-ol (10 cm3) at 40 C Complex (0.02 mmol) Reduction Reduction of hex-1-ene cis-hex-2-ene rate\" max % of rate\" max % of frans-hex-2-ene h-ans-hex-2-ene_ (after t min) (after t min) [{Rh(C5Me5XHMe2pz)}2(JU-OH)2](C104)2 25 49% (15 min) 19 55% (30 min) [{Rh(C5Me5)Cl}2(^-Cl)2] 113 25% (10 min) 15 9% (300 min) \"Rate as cm3 (min X mmol Rh)~1 344 hex-1-ene significantly faster than does (1) (Table 3). Furthermore, the relatively high activity of (2) suggests that the catalyst may actually be a monomer [1]; support for this idea comes from the lack of evidence for ^-hydride complexes under catalytic conditions. Furthermore, the recently reported dinuclear complex [{Rl^CsN^^Oii-pzXAi-H);]'1' [5] is practically inactive as a catalyst. A possible reaction path for complex (2) is: (2) ^ [Rt^CsMesXHI^pzHOHKS)]- [RhtCsMesMHMeipzHOHXS)^?^ Rh(CsMes)(Me2pz)(OH)(S) + H+ Rh(C5Mes)(Mc2pz)(OH)(S) + H, ?=^ Rh(C5Me;)(Me2pz)(H)(S) + HaO Rh(CsMes)(Me2pz)(H)(S) + olefin ^ Rh(C5Mes)(Me2pz)(H)(olefm) Rh(C5Me5)(Me2pz)(H)(olefin) ^==S: Rh(CsMe5)(Me2pz)(alkyl)(S) Rh(CsMes)(Me2pz)(alkyl)(S) + H2 ^ Rh(CsMes)(Me2pz)(H)(S) It may be recalled that the 3,5-dimethylpyrazole shows a behaviour different in comparison with other pyrazole ligands [4]. Thus it can act as a monodentate neutral ligand, even in the presence of base, as well as an anionic exo-bidentate or anionic monodentate ligand. This behaviour may be impor- tant for avoiding the formation of dinuclear rhodium complexes which decrease the activity, and may affect positively the life of the catalyst. We have recently reported that (2) is obtained by reacting [Rh^Mes)- (Me2CO)3] (0104)2 with 3,5-dimethylpyrazole and triethylamine, while the triple-bridged complexes [{Rh(CsMes)}2(lJi.-Mexpz)'i({Ji-OH)'\\(ClO^) (x = 1 or 0) were obtained when 3-methylpyrazole or pyrazole was used [4]. For this reason we also examined the activity of the [Rh(C5Me5)(S)3](C104)2 com- plex in the presence of 3,5-dimethylpyrazole as ligand and triethylamine (Table 4). The catalyst precursor was prepared by successive addition of propan-2-ol to [Rh(CsMe5)(Me2CO)3] (04)2 and concentration. *H NMR studies on the material isolated showed that it could not be formulated as [Rl^CsI^^PrOI^]2'*'; although its formulation is uncertain, propoxo TABLE 4 Hydrogenation of hex-1-ene (3.0 nunol) using '[Rh(C5Mes)(S)3](C104)2' complexes at 1 atm and 40 C in propan-2-ol (10 cm3)' Complex HMeapz EtaN Initial ratea (0.04 nunol) (mmol) (mmol) [Rh(C5Mes)(S)3](C104)2 [Rh(C5Me5)(S)3](C104)2 1 [Rh(C5Mes)(S)3](C104)2 2 [Rh(C5Mes)(HMe2pz)3](ClC>4)2 [Rh(CsMes)(S)3](C104)2 1 [Rh(C5Mes)(S)3](C104)2 2 [Rh(C5Mes)(S)3](C104)2 2 \"Initial rate = cm3 (min X mmol Rh)~1. 3 38 34 10 3 9 2 346 groups coordinated to rhodium are probably involved. The activity of this material as a hydrogenation catalyst was moderate but, as expected, the addition to one or two moles of 3,5-dimethylpyrazole gave rise to a signifi- cant increase of activity. Higher amounts of dimethylpyrazole as present in the complex [Rh(C5Me5>(HMe2pz)3] (04)2 [6], had no positive effect. The activity of the latter complex as well as of complex (2) has decreased by adding triethylamine. In summary, the most active T^-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl rhodium pyrazolate systems contain stoichiometric amounts of 'Rh(C5Me5)' species and dimethylpyrazolate groups. In these systems the base triethylamine does not act as cocatalyst, but seems to be important for the formation of the active catalytic species. Experimental The complexes used as catalysts were prepared according to the litera- ture methods [4, 7-9]. The olefins were purified from peroxides by chro- matography on a small column of activated alumina. Spectroscopic grade propan-2-ol was used as purchased. Hydrogenations were carried out in a 20 cm3 flask fitted with a side arm through which olefin could be introduced. The flask was attached to a glass atmosphere pressure apparatus and to a flask shaker. Hydrogenation runs Propan-2-ol (9 cm3) was added to the reaction flask containing a known amount of catalyst (0.02 mmol) and when necessary triethylamine and/or HPz was added. After the flask was connected to the apparatus, the system was alter- nately evacuated and flushed with hydrogen a total of four times to ensure totally air-free conditions. Hydrogen was then introduced into the master burette. The shaker motor was started, and the solution was presaturated with hydrogen for 10 min (cyclohexene) or 15 min (hexenes). After this period, the shaker and the clock were stopped and olefin (5.9 mmol for cyclohexene or 3.0 mmol for hexenes) in 1 cm3 of propan-2-ol was introduced through the side arm of the flask. The system was allowed to equilibrate and then the volume of hydrogen recorded. Shaking was recommenced and the timer simultaneously started. As the reaction proceeded, small aliquots of solution were removed and analysed by gas chromatography. Analyses The chromatographies were carried out on a Perkin-Elmer 3920 gas chromatograph and the following columns were used depending on the sub- strate: cyclohexene, 268 ^^S'-oxydipropionitrile over Chromosorb W-HP; hexenes, SBN sebaconitrile. 346 Acknowledgement We acknowledge useful discussions with Professor Peter Maitlis (Univer- sity of Sheffield) and we thank the Anglo-Spanish Joint Research Pro- gramme (Acciones Integradas) for making this possible.
