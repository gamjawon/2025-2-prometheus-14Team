The crystal phase of TiO2 plays a crucial role in tuning the catalytic performance of Re/TiO2 catalysts for base-free CO2 hydrogenation to methyl formate (MF). In this study, we investigated Re species supported on TiO2 with different crystal phases (P25, rutile, and anatase) to elucidate their structure–activity relationships. Among them, P25-supported Re catalyst (denoted as Re/TiO2-P) exhibited the highest catalytic performance, achieving a turnover frequency (TOF) of 4.8 h–1 at 150 °C for 2 h, along with excellent stability over five consecutive cycles. By reducing the catalyst dosage, the TOF was further increased to 10.3 h–1 at 160 °C. Comprehensive characterization revealed that the superior performance of Re/TiO2-P arises from its relatively weak metal-support interaction, which facilitates the reduction of Re7+ to Re4+, the key active species for H2 activation. These findings highlight the crucial influence of the TiO2 crystal phase on the oxidation state and catalytic behavior of Re species, offering valuable insights for designing efficient catalysts for base-free CO2 hydrogenation to MF.

Reducing CO2 levels in the atmosphere has become an urgent task for the sustainable development of human society. In this respect, carbon capture and utilization (CCU) capable of removing and upgrading CO2 represents a promising strategy to reduce CO2 emissions [1–3]. Among various transformation routes, CO2 hydrogenation to formic acid stands out as an appealing approach, since this reaction not only realizes CO2 utilization but also provides a carbon-neutral energy system for H2 storage and release [4–8]. Formic acid is known as an important C1 chemical with traditional applications in leather, textile, and dying industries. Catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid typically proceeds in the presence of base additives (e.g., KOH, KHCO3, triethylamine) to overcome unfavorable thermodynamics [9]. A large number of molecular complexes and heterogeneous catalysts have been demonstrated to show high activities for base-promoted CO2 hydrogenation to formate [10–12]. However, one drawback related to the utilization of base is that tedious acidification steps are required to finally obtain formic acid. Alternatively, CO2 hydrogenation to formic acid can be realized in the absence of bases by choosing a suitable solvent such as water, methanol, and DMSO [9]. These solvents can shift the reaction equilibrium towards formic acid by providing strong interaction with formic acid (solvation effects) to counteract the unfavorable thermodynamics [9,13,14]. Using methanol as solvent brings another benefit that enables the esterification of formic acid, thus yielding methyl formate (MF) as the major product [15–17]. This presents a prominent advantage in terms of facile product separation, that is, circumventing the formation of water-formic acid azeotrope and the much lower boiling point of MF than formic acid (31.8 vs. 100.8 °C) [18]. Moreover, in recent years, the emerging role of MF as a H2 carrier has aroused increasing attentions especially in the context of expanding the utilization of renewable hydrogen energy [19]. Many homogeneous catalysts have been explored for CO2 hydrogenation to MF, and most of them are based on the combination of Ru centers with various phosphine ligands [9,20]. Despite showing high catalytic activity, the high cost, problematic recycling, and air sensitivity of molecular complexes have stimulated the development of heterogeneous catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to MF. For example, ZnO-supported PdCu catalyst was reported to catalyze the formation of MF from CO2 with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 39 h–1 at 150 °C without base additives [21]. The addition of Pd was found to significantly improve the catalytic activity of Cu/ZnO likely due to the enhanced H2 activation. Besides, Cu/ZnO catalysts doped by ZSM-5 zeolites could also promote the formation of MF by providing more acidic sites for esterification [22]. Han et al. reported a ZrO2-supported Au nanocatalyst, wherein well-dispersed Au nanoparticles were proposed as the active center for CO2 hydrogenation to MF [16]. Thanks to the catalysis of Au species, a high TOF of up to 534 h–1 was obtained at 200 °C and 160 bar H2/CO2. Recently, Urakawa et al. described that SiO2-supported Ag catalysts showed higher activity than SiO2-supported Au and Cu catalysts for the gas phase CO2 hydrogenation to MF with 4 % yield at 280 °C and 300 bar H2/CO2 [23]. Based on in situ spectroscopic characterization and theoretical studies, the formation of MF was proposed to occur at the interface sites of Ag and SiO2, wherein CO2 was adsorbed on SiO2 to generate carbonic acid that can accelerate the esterification. In addition, the authors reported that the type of support significantly affect the activity of Ag catalysts [24]. In compared to the neutral SiO2 support, ZrO2-supported Ag catalysts led to the 25 times higher space time yield of MF (16.2 gMF gAg h–1). The authors attributed the improved activity to the strong Lewis acidity of ZrO2 promoting the spillover of formate from Ag particles to the interface of Ag and support. Clearly, support appears to play an important role in tuning the catalytic activities for CO2 hydrogenation to MF. However, structure engineering of support was usually neglected in these studies, and the influence of support has not been fully understood yet. TiO2 is an excellent support finding wide applications in heterogeneous catalysis, in particular for catalytic CO2 hydrogenation [25–29]. The reducible nature of TiO2 usually enables a strong interaction between metal sites and TiO2, thus leading to the regulation of metal sites in terms of structural and electronic properties [30]. It has been reported that the catalytic performance of CO2 hydrogenation could be tuned by engineering the crystal phase and plane of TiO2 [31–33]. For example, in the case of Pd/TiO2 catalysts, using anatase TiO2 with exposed {100} facet as support showed much higher activity and stability than P25 TiO2 and TiO2 with other facets for CO2 hydrogenation to formate [28]. Lin et al. reported the rutile TiO2 is a superior support compared to anatase TiO2 showing enhanced activity and stability for Ru-catalyzed CO2 methanation [32]. This is mainly due to the strong interaction of rutile TiO2 with RuO2 (also rutile type), leading to highly dispersed Ru nanoparticles. These studies suggest that the crystal phase of TiO2 plays a pivotal role in governing catalytic performance. We envision that an efficient and stable solid catalyst for base-free CO2 hydrogenation to MF could be achieved by studying the influence of the crystal phase of TiO2. Herein, TiO2 with different crystal phases of P25, anatase, and rutile was used as a support to load Re species, a highly-active component for CO2 hydrogenation, to construct a series of Re/TiO2 catalysts. Among them, the P25-supported Re catalyst (Re/TiO2-P) showed the highest activity for CO2 hydrogenation to MF. By correlating catalytic activity with characterization results, we attribute the crystal phase-dependent performance primarily to the varied oxidation states of Re species on different TiO2 supports. As revealed by spectroscopy and chemisorption results, the relatively weaker metal-support interaction between Re and TiO2-P facilitates the reduction of Re7+ to Re4+ by methanol during the reaction. The higher fraction of Re4+ species on TiO2-P provides more active sites for H2 activation, which is the rate-determining step for CO2 hydrogenation to MF, thereby leading to the superior activity of Re/TiO2-P. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials Methanol (≥99.9 %) were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd.

Typically, TiO2 (2 g) was added to the aqueous solution of NH4ReO4 (0.0891 g in 100 mL deionized water), and then the mixture was stirred for 2 h at room temperature. The suspension was further evaporated through rotary evaporation (70 °C). The obtained solid sample was dried at 110 °C for 12 h, and finally calcined at 500 °C for 3 h in air (5 °C/min). The obtained catalysts were designated as Re/TiO2-P, Re/TiO2-R, and Re/TiO2-A, corresponding to the use of TiO2-P25, TiO2 rutile, and TiO2 anatase as supports, respectively. 2.3 Materials characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using a Rigaku Smartlab 9 KW diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ=0.154 nm). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted using a ThermoFisher Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi instrument equipped with Al Kα as the X-ray source at room temperature. All binding energies were calibrated based on the C1s peak at 284.6 eV. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured at –196.15 °C using an BELSORP-MINI automatic surface area and pore size analyzer. Prior to measurements, all samples were degassed at 300 °C for 6 h. Raman spectra were collected in the range of 100–3500 cm–1 using a ThermoFisher Scientific DXR2 Raman microscope equipped with a 532 nm Ar ion laser at room temperature (exposure 5 s, 20 times scan, 5.5–8.3 cm–1 resolution). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were recorded using a JEM-2010 instrument (JEOL) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) images and Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping were recorded using a Tecnai F30 (FEI) instrument equipped with a High-angle annular dark-field (HADDF) detector operating at 300 kV. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signals were acquired on a Bruker ESR A300 spectrometer at liquid nitrogen temperature at –196.15 °C. The contents of Re were determined by an ICP-5000 inductively coupled plasma-optical emission (ICP-OES) spectrometer (Focused Photonics Inc.). Prior to analysis, Re/TiO2 was digested using a mixed acid solution of HNO3 and HF. UV-Vis spectra were acquired at room temperature on a PerkinElmer Lambda 750 S UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer equipped with a diffuse reflection integrating-sphere accessory using BaSO4 as the reference. Chemisorption measurements were carried out on a JW-HX100 (JWGB INSTRUMENTS) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). For H2-TPR, Re/TiO2 catalyst (70 mg) was pretreated at 150 °C under Ar for 1 h, and then cooled to 50 °C. After switching to 5 % H2/Ar atmosphere, the sample was heated to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min. For H2-TPD, Re/TiO2 catalyst (80 mg) was first pretreated at 300 °C under Ar atmosphere for 1 h, and then cooled to 80 °C for H2 adsorption under 5 % H2/Ar atmosphere for 20 min. After H2 adsorption, the catalyst was purged for 0.5 h under Ar at 80 °C and further heated to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C /min to acquire H2 desorption signals. For NH3-TPD, Re/TiO2 catalyst (80 mg) was pretreated at 300 °C under He for 1 h, and then cooled to 80 °C for NH3 adsorption under 5 % NH3/He for 1 h. After switching to He and purging for 0.5 h at 80 °C, the sample was heated to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min to record the desorbed NH3 signal. For CO2-TPD, Re/TiO2 catalyst (80 mg) was pretreated at 300 °C under He atmosphere for 1 h, and then cooled to 80 °C for CO2 adsorption under 10 % CO2/He atmosphere for 1 h. After switching to He and purging for 0.5 h, the sample was heated to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C /min to record the desorbed CO2 signal. For H2-pulse chemisorption, Re/TiO2 catalyst (300 mg) was pretreated at 550 °C under 5 % H2/Ar for 3 h, followed by purging under Ar at 500 °C for 0.5 h and then at 80 °C for 0.5 h. H2 adsorption was then measured at 80 °C by sequentially injecting 5 % H2/Ar pulses into the catalyst for a total of 25 injections. 2.4 Catalytic reaction CO2 hydrogenation was carried out in a 25 mL stainless steel autoclave (LABE Instrument). Typically, Re/TiO2 catalyst (30 mg) and methanol (10 mL) were added to the autoclave. After sealing, the reactor was purged with CO2 for 6 times, and then pressurized with CO2 (2 MPa) and H2 (6 MPa) in sequence. The reactor was heated to the target temperature while maintaining a magnetic stirring speed of 1000 rpm. The reaction time was recorded from the moment the reactor reached the target temperature. To terminate the reaction, the autoclave was cooled by immersion in cold water. The gas products in the autoclave were collected by a gas bag and analyzed by an Agilent 8890 gas chromatograph equipped with a double column system (4 F Unibeads/8 F MolSieve 5 A and Unibeads 1 s) and a TCD detector. The filtered liquid products were mixed with mesitylene as an internal standard. This mixture was diluted in CD3CN for 1H NMR quantification analysis (Bruker AVANCE NEO 400 MHz). For recycling experiments, the first run followed the same procedure as mentioned above. After reaction, the catalyst was washed with methanol and separated from the liquid solution by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 6 min. The supernatant liquid was used for 1H NMR quantification analysis. The remaining solids were dried at room temperature for 17 h. The dried catalyst was further applied for the next test using the same procedure as mentioned above. The TON and TOF calculation are based on following equations: TON = n MF n Re TOF = TON t Where nMF is the moles of MF obtained from 1H NMR quantification using mesitylene as the internal standard, nRe is the total moles of Re species determined by ICP, t is the reaction time (typically 2 h). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst characterization The structural properties of Re/TiO2 catalysts were investigated by N2 physisorption, XRD, and TEM. The actual Re loadings measured by ICP are similar (2.5 wt%) for all catalysts ( Table 1). As shown in Figure S1, all Re/TiO2 catalysts displayed type III isotherms with H3 hysteresis loops, indicating the non-porous nature of TiO2 nanoparticles and the presence of irregular intergranular pores. Compared to pristine TiO2, all Re/TiO2 catalysts exhibited slightly reduced specific surface areas but increased pore volumes. This phenomenon is likely attributed to the sintering and aggregation of TiO2 nanoparticles during calcination, which may lead to the formation of new intergranular pores. The XRD patterns of all Re/TiO2 catalysts showed the diffraction peaks corresponding to rutile and anatase phases (Figure S2). The absence of diffraction peaks corresponding to metallic Re or ReOx in the XRD patterns suggests the formation of highly dispersed Re species on TiO2 support. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of the Re/TiO2 catalysts, shown in Fig. 1, reveal no observable Re or ReOx particles, confirming the high dispersion of Re species. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping of Re/TiO2 catalysts further confirms the presence of Re species homogeneous distribution on TiO2 (Figure S3). The measured lattice fringes at 3.5 and 3.6 Å correspond to the (101) plane of TiO2 anatase (JCPDS 21-1272), while those at 3.3 and 2.5 Å correspond to the (110) and (101) planes of TiO2 rutile (JCPDS 21-1276), respectively. All TiO2 supports show similar average particle sizes in the range of 30–40 nm (Table 1). As shown in the Raman spectra ( Fig. 2a), in addition to the typical bands at 100–700 cm–1 assigned to Ti–O and Ti–O–Ti vibrations, all Re/TiO2 catalysts displayed adsorption bands at 800–1000 cm–1 corresponding to Re species. For Re/TiO2-A, the single band at 975 cm–1 could be attributed to the symmetric Re=O stretch vibration of isolated perrhenate ion (ReO4 –) [34–36], while this Re=O stretch band was upward shifted to 986 cm–1 for Re/TiO2-P and Re/TiO2-R. It was reported that the increased wavenumber of Re=O stretch mode is related to the weaker interaction between ReOx and support [34]. Notably, another intense band at 957 cm–1 appeared for Re/TiO2-R, indicating the presence of another type of ReOx species that has strong interaction with TiO2-R. Therefore, it can be concluded that the interaction of ReOx with TiO2-P is relatively weaker compared to TiO2-R and TiO2-A. As revealed by H2-chemisorption (Table 1), the Re species on TiO2-R and TiO2-P exhibit very high dispersions of 70.6 and 88.8 %, respectively. In contrast, Re/TiO2-A shows a lower dispersion of 39.5 %, likely due to the strong metal-support interaction that inhibits H2 chemisorption [36,37], as indicated by H2-TPR results (Fig. 2b). Based on the XRD, HRTEM, H2-chemisortpion, and Raman results, we can conclude that the ReOx species is highly dispersed on TiO2 supports after high-temperature calcination, consistent with findings from previous studies [36,38–40]. The reducibility of ReOx on TiO2 was studied by H2 temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) (Fig. 2b). Re/TiO2-P showed a single H2-consumption peak centered at 200 °C, and Re/TiO2-A showed an intense peak centered at 279 °C with a broad tail (300–500 °C). This single peak in Re/TiO2-P and Re/TiO2-A suggests the presence of homogeneous ReOx species. Two distinct H2-consumption peaks centered at 207 and 240 °C were observed for Re/TiO2-R, likely indicating the presence of two types of ReOx species featuring different interaction with TiO2-R, which is in agreement with Raman findings. The reduction of ReOx in Re/TiO2-P begins at around 160°C, which is lower than the onset temperatures for Re/TiO2-A and Re/TiO2-R, which occur at approximately 250 °C and 190 °C, respectively. The much lower onset and peak temperatures for Re/TiO2-P suggest that ReOx species is more easily reduced on TiO2-P, likely due to the weaker interaction between ReOx and TiO2-P, consistent with the Raman results. The high peak temperature of Re/TiO2-A indicates the strongest interaction between Re with TiO2-A among these catalysts. The adsorption behaviors of CO2 on Re/TiO2 catalysts was probed by CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) (Fig. 2c). All catalyst exhibited a desorption peak centered at 140–150 °C, indicating that they all have similar weak CO2 adsorption strength. In terms of the adsorbed amount of CO2, Re/TiO2-R exhibited a very low adsorption amount of 4 μmol/g, while Re/TiO2-P and Re/TiO2-A displayed higher adsorption amounts of 30.5 and 48.6 μmol/g (Table 1), respectively. Clearly, CO2 adsorption is favored on Re/TiO2-P and Re/TiO2-A, but is severely limited on Re/TiO2-R due to the fewer available basic sites. H2-TPD was used to investigate the hydrogen adsorption behavior on Re/TiO2 catalysts. As shown in Figure S4a, all catalysts exhibited a H2 desorption peak in the temperature range of 100–300 °C, indicating the presence of moderate H2-adsorption sites on the Re/TiO2 catalysts. The hydrogen adsorption capacity followed the order: Re/TiO2-P (18.2 μmol/g) > Re/TiO2-A (14.6 μmol/g) > Re/TiO2-R (5.5 μmol/g). These results suggest that Re/TiO2-P has a higher capability for H2 activation compared to the other catalysts. The NH3-TPD profiles of Re/TiO2-P and Re/TiO2-A (Figure S4b) revealed two desorption peaks centered around 170 °C and 350 °C, respectively, indicating the presence of weak and moderate acid sites. The total acid site concentrations for Re/TiO2-P and Re/TiO2-A were calculated to be 170.2 and 289.6 μmol/g, respectively. In contrast, NH3 desorption peaks for Re/TiO2-R were shifted to 130 °C and 315 °C, with reduced intensity, corresponding to a total acid site concentration of 24.5 μmol/g. Re/TiO2-R is characterized by fewer acid sites and weaker acid strength compared to Re/TiO2-P and Re/TiO2-A. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was applied to ascertain the oxidation state of Re species on TiO2 ( Fig. 3). For calcined Re/TiO2 catalysts, their XPS 4f signals could be deconvoluted into three set of doublet peaks assignable to Re(4f 7/2) 4+ (∼42.5 eV), Re(4f 7/2) 5+/Re(4f 7/2) 6+ (∼43.6 eV), and Re(4f 7/2) 7+ (∼45.6 eV) [37,41–43]. The formation of low oxidation states of Re indicates the partial reduction of Re7+ during the calcination step for NH4ReO4 decomposition. As indicated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), abundant oxygen vacancies are present in TiO2 supports (Figure S5). The partial reduction of NH4ReO4 during calcination is likely due to the strong interaction between TiO2 and ReOx, where electron transfer from oxygen vacancies facilitates the reduction of Re7+ [37,44]. The relative ratio of different Re species was calculated based on the integral peak area ( Table 2). Re7+ is the dominant species in all Re/TiO2 catalysts. The percentage of Re4⁺ varies depending on the type of TiO2, following the order: Re/TiO2-P > Re/TiO2-A > Re/TiO2-R. In contrast, the percentage of Re6⁺ and Re5⁺ follows the inverse order: Re/TiO2-R > Re/TiO2-A > Re/TiO2-P. Considering that the solvent methanol could also contribute to the reduction of Re7+ during the reaction [35,45,46], we further examined the oxidation states of Re in Re/TiO2 catalysts subjected to methanol treatment in autoclave (160 °C, 2 h). After methanol treatment, the XPS 4 f signals of Re/TiO2 catalysts could be deconvoluted into two peaks corresponding to Re(4f 7/2) 7⁺ (∼45.6 eV) and Re(4f 7/2) 4⁺ (∼42.8 eV) without observing the peaks of Re(4f 7/2) 5+/Re(4f 7/2) 6+. Compared to Re/TiO2 without methanol treatment, the percentage of Re(4f 7/2) 4⁺ and Re(4f 7/2) 7⁺ increased at the expense of Re(4f 7/2) 5+/Re(4f 7/2) 6+. One possible explanation is that Re(4f 7/2) 5+/Re(4f 7/2) 6+ underwent disproportionation to yield Re(4f 7/2) 4⁺ and Re(4f 7/2) 7⁺ during methanol treatment [41]. Notably, the percentage of Re4⁺ in methanol-treated Re/TiO2 showed the same trend as the that of untreated catalysts: Re/TiO2-P > Re/TiO2-A > Re/TiO2-R. As shown in Figure S4c, the UV-Vis spectra of calcined Re/TiO2 catalysts showed strong absorption bands in the UV region (200–400 nm), primarily arising from TiO2, which masks the signals of ReOx (mainly Re7⁺) in this range. Notably, both Re/TiO2-P and Re/TiO2-A exhibited a broad absorption band from 420 to 700 nm, which could be attributed to the reduced ReOx species, likely featuring oxidation states ≤ +4 [35,45]. In contrast, the band ascribed to reduced ReOx species is negligible for Re/TiO2-R. These results suggest the least fraction of reduced ReOx (with valences ≤ +4) in Re/TiO2-R, consistent with the XPS findings. 3.2 Catalytic performances The hydrogenation of CO2 was performed in methanol without adding base under 6 MPa of H2/CO2 (4/2) at 150–180 °C to assess the catalytic activities of different Re/TiO2 catalysts. As revealed by the 1H NMR spectrum (Figure S6), MF is the only product detected in the liquid phase. The catalytic activities of Re/TiO2 were compared by calculating the specific formation rates of MF within the first 2 h (far from reaction equilibrium), expressed as the TOF based on the total moles of Re species. As shown in Fig. 4a, Re/TiO2-P showed the highest activity with a TOF of 4.8 h–1 at 150 °C, while Re/TiO2-A and Re/TiO2-R exhibited TOFs of 4.1 h–1 and 3.9 h–1, respectively. These results indicate the superior ability of TiO2-P to disperse ReOx, forming an efficient catalyst for CO₂ hydrogenation to MF. The formation of MF reached equilibrium within 20 h, and its concentration remained unchanged when the reaction time was extended to 25 h (Figure S7). A similar equilibrium MF concentration of around 20 mM, corresponding to TONs of around 47 (Fig. 4b), was achieved for all Re/TiO2 catalysts within 25 h. The dependence of MF formation rate (TOF within the first 2 h) on the reaction conditions for Re/TiO2 catalysts was studied. The formation of MF was accelerated at elevated reaction temperatures. As shown in Fig. 4c, the TOF of Re/TiO2-P significantly increased from 4.8 to 10.3 h–1 with the reaction temperature increasing from 150 to 190 °C. For Re/TiO2-A and Re/TiO2-R, their TOFs were improved to 9.5 and 9.4 h–1 at 180 °C, respectively. The apparent activation energy (Ea) was calculated from the Arrhenius plots using the TOFs measured between 150 and 180 °C (Fig. 4d). The Ea for Re/TiO2-P was determined to be 41.7 kJ/mol, while Re/TiO2-A and Re/TiO2-R showed slightly higher values of 45.6 and 46.6 kJ/mol, respectively. Together with the TOF trend, these results further indicate the higher catalytic activity of Re/TiO2-P for MF generation. By reducing the catalyst loading, the TOF of Re/TiO2-P was further increased to 10.3 h–1 at 160 °C (Table S1), which is comparable to highly-active Pd catalysts reported for base-free CO2 hydrogenation [47]. Notably, the Re/TiO2-P catalyst exhibited excellent recyclability, maintaining stable TONs of approximately 15 over five successive tests (Figure S8). The effects of H2 and CO2 pressures on the formation rate of MF over different Re/TiO2 catalysts were investigated. For all catalysts, increasing H2 and CO2 pressures enhanced MF formation, resulting in higher TOFs. No MF was detected in the absence of H2 or CO2 (Figure S9), confirming that MF is derived from CO2 and H2 rather than methanol. Additionally, methane was detected in the gas phase as a side product, and its formation rate (TOF) remained independent of CO2 pressure within the range of 0–3 MPa (Figure S10). This clearly indicates that methane is produced via methanol hydrogenolysis rather than CO2 hydrogenation. As shown in Fig. 4e, the apparent reaction order of CO2 varied with the type of TiO2: Re/TiO2-R (0.48) > Re/TiO2-P (0.35) > Re/TiO2-A (0.26). This suggests that CO2 adsorption/activation on Re/TiO2-R is more challenging, which is consistent with its lowest amount of basic sites determined by CO2-TPD (Table 1). The reaction order of H2 followed the trend (Fig. 4f): Re/TiO2-R (0.85) > Re/TiO2-A (0.8) > Re/TiO2-P (0.68), which inversely correlates with the TOF trend of Re/TiO2 catalysts (Fig. 4a). The inverse correlation suggests that MF formation is more dependent on the adsorption/activation of H2 rather than CO2. Moreover, the significantly higher reaction orders of H2 compared to CO2 indicate that H2 adsorption/activation is the rate-determining step for CO2 hydrogenation to MF over all Re/TiO2 catalysts. Therefore, the activity differences among Re/TiO2 catalysts can be primarily attributed to their varying abilities to adsorb and activate H2. As revealed by H2-TPD results (Fig. 2d), Re/TiO2-P possesses the highest H2 adsorption capacity (18.2 μmol/g), thus accounting for its excellent activity in MF formation. Notably, the concentration of Re4+ in different Re/TiO2 catalysts, both with and without methanol treatment, correlates well with the TOF trend, i.e., a higher Re4+ concentration corresponds to higher TOF values. In contrast, no clear correlation is observed between TOF and other properties of Re/TiO2, such as the Re6+/Re5+ concentration, basic sites, or acidic sites. The influence of Re4+ on catalytic activity was further examined by controlling the reduction degree of Re species on TiO2-A. Following the method of Re/TiO2-A (calcination in air at 500 °C for 3 h), we prepared two Re catalysts with different thermal treatments to vary the fraction of Re4+ on TiO2-A. One Re catalyst was first calcined in air at 500 °C for 3 h and further reduced under 5 % H2/Ar at 210 °C for 1.5 h to promote the reduction of Re, denoted as Re/TiO2-A-H2. The other Re catalyst was calcined in air at 500 °C for 0.5 h to limit the reduction of Re species by TiO2-A, denoted as Re/TiO2-A-0.5 h. As shown in Figure S11 and Table S2, the relative concentration of Re4+ follows the order: Re/TiO2-A-0.5 h (8.9 %) < Re/TiO2-A (20.2 %) < Re/TiO2-A-H2 (37.8 %). The corresponding TOFs of these Re catalysts also follow the same order: Re/TiO2-A-0.5 h (3.0 h–1) < Re/TiO2-A (4.1 h–1) < Re/TiO2-A-H2 (4.7 h–1). The positive correlation between Re4+ and TOFs further supports our proposal that Re4+ plays an important role in affecting the catalytic activity of CO2 hydrogenation to MF. It has been reported that H2 adsorption/activation typically occurs on reduced Re species with valences between 0 and + 4 [42,48,49]. Therefore, it is reasonable to propose that Re4+ serves as the active site for H2 adsorption/activation on Re/TiO2. As demonstrated by Raman, H2-TPR, and UV-Vis spectroscopy, the relatively-weak interaction between ReOx and TiO2-P facilitates the reduction of Re7+ to Re4+ in methanol, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity of Re/TiO2-P for CO2 hydrogenation to MF. Besides, the presence of suitable acid sites on Re/TiO2-P contributes to MF formation by promoting esterification (Table 1). Taken together, these experimental and characterization results suggest that the TiO2 crystal phase significantly influences the reducibility of ReOx, which is the primary factor governing catalytic activity. Although the basic and acidic properties of Re/TiO2 are also affected by the TiO2 crystal phase, their impact appears to be secondary to the reducibility of ReOx species. CO2 hydrogenation to formic acid/formate is recognized as a key step in the formation of methyl formate (MF) [15,23]. To elucidate the mechanism of formic acid/formate formation, the evolution of surface intermediates on Re/TiO2-P were investigated using in situ time-resolved diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). Prior to DRIFTS analysis, the catalyst was pretreated in methanol at 160 °C for 2 h in an autoclave. The spectra were collected in a stepwise manner: CO2 was first introduced at 160 °C to allow surface adsorption, followed by the introduction of H2 to probe the hydrogenation of CO2-derived species. As shown in Fig. 5a, two distinct bands at 1650 and 1445 cm–1 appeared under CO2 flow, corresponding to adsorbed bicarbonate and carbonate species [31,50–52], respectively. Upon switching to H2, the bicarbonate band gradually diminished, accompanied by the emergence of a new band at 1590 cm–1, which is attributed to surface formate species (Fig. 5b). In contrast, the carbonate band remained unchanged. These results suggest that CO2 adsorbs on Re/TiO2-P as both carbonate and bicarbonate species, with bicarbonate acting as the reactive intermediate that undergoes hydrogenation to form formate. 4 Conclusion In conclusion, Re-based catalysts supported on TiO2-P, TiO2-R, and TiO2-A were synthesized and evaluated for CO2 hydrogenation to MF, revealing a dependence of catalytic activity on the TiO2 crystal phase. Among them, Re/TiO2-P exhibited the highest activity, achieving a TOF of 4.8 h–1 at 150 °C for 2 h, along with excellent stability, maintaining a TON of ∼15 over five consecutive cycles. The oxidation state of Re species on different TiO2 supports was identified as the key factor governing MF formation rates. During catalyst calcination and reaction, the pristine Re7+ species underwent partial reduction, generating low-valence Re species, particularly Re4+, which serves as the active site for H2 activation. The relatively weak metal-support interaction in Re/TiO2-P facilitated the reduction of Re7+, leading to a higher fraction of Re4+ species and, consequently, enhanced catalytic performance. This study highlights the critical role of TiO2 crystal phases in modulating the hydrogenation activity of Re species and provides valuable insights for designing highly efficient supported catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to MF.

        "dc:description": "The crystal phase of TiO2 plays a crucial role in tuning the catalytic performance of Re/TiO2 catalysts for base-free CO2 hydrogenation to methyl formate (MF). In this study, we investigated Re species supported on TiO2 with different crystal phases (P25, rutile, and anatase) to elucidate their structure–activity relationships. Among them, P25-supported Re catalyst (denoted as Re/TiO2-P) exhibited the highest catalytic performance, achieving a turnover frequency (TOF) of 4.8 h–1 at 150 °C for 2 h, along with excellent stability over five consecutive cycles. By reducing the catalyst dosage, the TOF was further increased to 10.3 h–1 at 160 °C. Comprehensive characterization revealed that the superior performance of Re/TiO2-P arises from its relatively weak metal-support interaction, which facilitates the reduction of Re7+ to Re4+, the key active species for H2 activation. These findings highlight the crucial influence of the TiO2 crystal phase on the oxidation state and catalytic behavior of Re species, offering valuable insights for designing efficient catalysts for base-free CO2 hydrogenation to MF.",
