S. WEBER Center for Catalytic Science and Technology, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19711 (U.S.A.) (Received September 2, 1982) Summary A series of five one-component catalysts has been investigated: (f?3- CgH^NitCHaCOCHCOCHa) (la), (^-CgH^NHCFaCOCHCOCHa) (Ib), (7?^-CsHl3)Ni(CF3COCHCOCF3) (Ic), (PPhg^oHsNUPPhaCHCOPh) (2) and (^-CgH^NUPPhaCHaCOO) (3). Their catalytic activity and selectivity in the oligomerization of small alkenes are discussed: 1 catalyzes the dimeriza- tion of but-1-ene to 80% linear octenes (turnover number at 75 C for Ie: 0.2 s~1); 2 and 3 oligomerize ethylene to 99% linear a-olefins in the - Cw range (turnover number at 75 C for 3: 0.8 s~1). Compound 3 is a model for the catalyst system employed in the SHELL-Higher-Olefins-Process. K-edge XAS and ESCA spectra of 1 - 3 show square-planar d^onfiguration in all cases and allow an inverse volcano-type correlation between ESCA chemical shifts and catalytic activity and selectivity. A mechanistic explana- tion with regard to the insertion step and the chain growth terminating j3-H elimination reaction is undertaken. Introduction As was found earlier [1-6], nickel chelate complexes exhibit an extraordinary activity and selectivity in the linear oligomerization of small alkenes. The systems we investigated can be used as one-component catalysts 0304-5102/83/$3.00 Elsevier Sequoia^Printed in The Netherlands 116 and therefore may be regarded as model compounds of the active species. Because of the rigid chelate structure and the straightforward oligomeriza- tion mechanism, they can be described in terms of the most simple picture of any catalyst, i.e. being composed of a metal center, a ligand moiety (the chelate in our case) and the range where the catalytic reaction takes place. All three components are equally important for activity and selectivity of a catalyst. Thus, for example the structure of the hydrocarbon part being either bis-alkyi (i.e. forming a metallacycle) [7,8], alkyl-alkene [1,2,6], or allyl [9] in the catalyst precursor may determine whether the system forms cyclic or linear products or stays inactive. Most spectroscopic methods such as IR and NMR render information on the ligand and reaction moiety. Their interaction is then described in terms of steric and electronic ligand effects (or influences), the latter acting through the metal orbitals [10-12]. A direct account of the electron density and configuration at the transition metal can be given by ultraviolet photoelectron speetroscopy UPS [13,14], X-ray photoelectron spectros- copy (XPS or ESCA) [15 -18] and the related X-ray absorption speetros- copy (using synchrotron radiation) [20,21]. We applied the latter two techniques to a series of five nickel CTO- and 0 P-chelate complexes. They are highly active one-component catalysts for the selective linear oligomeri- zation of alkenes [1-4,6]. The 0 P-nickel complexes are close model compounds for the catalyst system employed in the industrial SHELL- Higher-Olefins-Process 'SHOP' [5, 22, 23]. Experimental The organotransition metal complexes investigated in this study were all prepared under anaerobic conditions. Their syntheses are described in previous publications as well as their characterization by IR, NMR, MS and andXSA [1,3,6,24,25]. Catalytic experiments for the determination of kinetic parameters were carried out in Pyrex glass autoclaves (40 ml; Pmax = 1 MPa) or stainless steel autoclaves (75 ml; Pmax != 10 MPa). A detailed account of the measure- ment procedure is given in ref. [6]; the standard reaction mixture consisted of a solution of the nickel complex in toluene, the alkene (dried over NaAl- Et4) and internal GC standards n-hexane and n-undecane. Initial reaction rates were determined by following the pressure drop in the autoclave due to the formation of oligomer product; the necessary calibration functions for C2H4 and C^g in toluene c = t{T, P) were measured independently. The reaction products were analyzed by capillary GC: silicon 0V 101, 60 m X 0.25 mm i.d., temp. progr. 30 - 230 C ( - Cu alkanes and alkenes); 7,8- and 5,6-benzoquinoline (3:1) on 300 mX 0.5 mm i.d. stainless steel, T= 9 C (Cg alkenes). ESCA apectra were taken on an AEI ES-200 spectrometer with an Al KQ X-ray source (14 kV, 20 mA). All chemical shifts are reported in respect 117 to a CIs binding energy of 285.0 eV. We prepared the ESCA samples in a nitrogen purged glove box which was equipped with a lock for the transfer system of the spectrometer sample rod. The powdered nickel complexes were simply attached to a Scotch tape support on the rod. This technique even proved applicable for the analysis of such air-sensitive compounds as bis-cyclooctadiene nickel. K-edge X-ray absorption spectra were measured at the Stanford Syn- chrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) at a ring energy of 2.60 GeV (current =25 mA). The first and second ionization chambers were filled with argon. A 25 Jum nickel foil was used as a calibration standard with a leading K-edge at 8331.6 eV. In a glove box the powder samples were pressed into self-supporting wafers of 1 mmol nickel complex per cm2, using a standard IR die. These wafers were then cut to size (10 X 5 mm) and carried to SSRL in a sealed glass holder with Be windows for passage of the X-ray beam. No radiation damage of the samples (even with (Cod)2Ni) has been observed. Results Alkene oligomerization The catalytic behaviour of three types of nickel chelate complexes was studied. The common features of compounds la, Ib, Ic, 2 and 3 are their bidentate chelate structure, their high intrinsic catalytic activity towards the olefin oligomerization reaction and the outstanding selectivity in the ^ /\"-^ I \\ ^'N<\\...},^\" ' ~.W || \\ y '0-C^ ph-p^ n-C N< ...;.CH v --N< Ph^ Vt-Ph ^R. \"'3\" 1 2 Ig'R^R^CHg 1b.

After charging the autoclaves at room temperature with 5 MPa ethylene (all the catalysts are inactive below ~ 40 C), the reaction temperature of 75 C (50 C for 2) was reached within ca. 10 min by means of a water bath; this was followed by a pressure rise. Catalysts la, 1b and Ic exhibited pronounced induction periods of T = 60 min, T = 30 min and T = 15 min before first-order oligomerization commenced. With Ic, it is probable that the S-shape P-t curve is not caused by some autocatalytic effect but simply by a superposition of first-order 118 Reaction Time [hi Fig. 1. Pressure-time curves for the oligomerization of ethylene with catalysts la, Ib, Ic, 2 and 3; solvent toluene; reaction temperature = 75 \"C (1, 3) and 50 C (2). oligomerization and the starting step, i.e. by replacement of the 4-enyl ligand (formation of cyclo-octadiene and bicyclo[3,3,0]-oct-2-ene) by alkene and alkyi ligands from the ethylene substrate. Surprisingly with but-1-ene as substrate and 1 as catalyst, no induction period was observed. Catalyst 3 started immediately after the reaction temperature was attained. Complex 2 revealed an even more complicated P-t behaviour; after a 5 min induction period at zero conversion, oligomerization took place within some seconds and was then terminated by diffusion limitation in the high molec- ular weight product formed. The heat of polymerization released can lead to non-isothermal conditions and to an explosion-like pressure burst. The starting step is the insertion of an ethylene molecule into the nickel-phenyl bond, as confirmed by GC detection of styrene in the reaction mixture after a near-stoichiometric run [6]. A summary of the kinetic data on the oligomerization of ethylene and but-1-ene is given in Table 1. ESCA and X-ray absorption spectra The different modes of ionization in X-ray photoelectron and X-ray absorption spectroscopy are illustrated in Fig. 2. In the former method, medium core level electrons are excited into the vacuum using the charac- teristic Ho, radiation of an X-ray tube (Al Kg, in this study) and their kinetic energy is analyzed, which yields by substraction from the exciting energy hv the binding energy at the core [19]. As shown in Fig. 3 and Table 2, it was found that -Ebind corresponding to the Ni 2py/^ level increased with increasing electronegativity of the chelate ligand. By comparison with literature data collected by Tolman et al. [15] for a vast number of nickel organic complexes, the acetylacetonato compounds la, Ib and Ic may be placed in the range of nickel complexes with a formal oxidation state of +2, whereas 2 and 3 carry a distinctly higher electron density at the nickel center corresponding to a partial charge of between +1 and zero. * -i 0. a 4^ CO a fl ^ f-QDOOWCO gC10 <a i-< o o o t.? cj (M < 10OS S^i-1 i-l r-! u >M 01 g.

Nevertheless the occurrence of shake-up satellites (which can originate from ligand-metal 3d transitions) on the low .E^in sides of the Ni 2p peaks suggests a diamagnetic square-planar d^configuration for all five compounds, in contrast to d^-complexes with completely filled 3d orbitals [26].

Discussion Before attempting to discuss possible correlations between kinetic and spectroscopic data (Tables 1 and 2), we shall focus on the mechanism of 123 alkene oligomerization. As shown in great detail in ref. [6], the kinetics observed with all the catalysts 1, 2 and 3 may best be described by a Michaelis-Menten-type rate law (eqn. 1). k ^K i[ alkene] r=Ni* (1) 1+Ki [alkene] where Ni* is the total catalyst concentration. With the 6^)-chelate catalyst, eqn. 1 approaches the borderline case r= N1*^2 (.KJalkene] > 1). The rate law expressed in eqn. 1 reflects there- fore the generally accepted mechanism [10] for the linear oligomerization reaction with the following key steps: a) association ,. 1 LnNi R = H or alkyi b) insertion LnNi /R' , LnNi-CH-,-CHR-R 11 / - /CH^R- n - mode iso- mode c) elitnination LnNi-CH^-CHR-R - LnNi-H + CH2=CR-R In the case of but-1-ene as substrate, the insertion step (b) determines the rate as well as the selectivity of the overall reaction; two different orienta- tions (n 4a and iso 4b) are possible. Linear octenes are exclusively formed from but-1-ene if the first insertion in the Ni H bond occurs in the n-mode 4b 124 (Markownikoff), and the second in the ? 119 bond in the iso-mode (anti-Markownikoff). With substrate C2H4 only linear products are possible, as long as no side reactions such as the re-insertion of the primary product but-1-ene take place. The j3-H elimination (rate = r^ua) is the reverse of the insertion into an Ni H bond with the same transition state 4a or 4b. Its contribution is described by the lvalue (see Table I): feeiim(l+^\"i[alkene]) 'dim '\"olig which is a useful measure for the chain length distribution in the polymeriza- tion product [27,28]. It is obvious that with l?i[alkene] > 1 the |3-value becomes independent of the substrate concentration. From our experiments there is no indication of a six-membered ring transition state (5) for the elimination step, as has been reported by several authors for titanium catal- ysts [29, 30] where ^-CH^ Ti.^^ 5 ^H^CHz ,- keUmlCztl^] fe = , j^u-i = const \"insert L^a^J If in fact there is a linear relationship between the electron density at the nickel coordination center, as given by the ESCA chemical shift, and the activation enthalpy of the oligomerization reaction, a semi-logarithmic plot such as that in Fig. 6 is to be expected where the values for the three homologous acetylacetonato-nickel complexes la, Ib and Ic lie on a straight line. Decreasing electron density caused by increased fluorine substi- tution lowers the activation barrier for the insertion [reaction (b)]. Further- more the reverse reaction j3-H elimination is enhanced, leading to a larger |3- 854 855 856 ESCA - Binding Energy leV] Fig. 6. Semi-logarithmic plot of oligomerization activity versus electron binding energy at the nickel center for complexes 1, 2 and 3 (as measured by ESCA; Ni 2p3/2 peak) for ethylene ( ) and but-1-ene (X) as substrates; for reaction conditions see Table 1. 125 100 B5t 855 856 ESCA- Binding Energy [eV] 657 Fig. 7.

For reaction conditions see Table 1. value for the product distribution (Fig. 7). This argument has been supported previously by EHT calculations [1] on the transition states 4a and 4b. The diamagnetic shift of the cyclooctenyl (3-hydrogen atoms with increased fluorine substitution as measured by ^ NMR spectroscopy provides further experimental support for this argument. It is obvious, however, that the change in E^ alone cannot account for the inverse volcano curve shown in Fig. 6. For complexes 2 and 3 the o-donor character of the 0 P-chelate ligand has an increasing effect on the ground level and weakens the Ni H and the Ni C bond. This effect, of course, does not influence the reverse reaction (j3-H elimination). The result is high oligomerization activity combined with low jS-values and no detec- table double bond isomerization (Fig. 7). Finally, the selectivity control in the dimerization of but-1-ene should be discussed [30, 31]. The enhanced preference for transition state 4a (n- mode) over 4b (iso-mode) with decreasing electron density at the nickel atom has already been predicted by EHT calculations on this system [I], but to achieve a highly linear octene fraction the second insertion step into the nickel-butyl bond has to occur with opposite orientation (iso-mode). Here a geometric rather than an electronic ligand effect acts, as shown by the constant 12% n-mode for all three acetylacetonato complexes. The 0 0-ligand has a flat planar configuration in contrast to the random shape of the n-butyl ligand. The high selectivity of the bulky phenyl- substituted 0 P-complexes towards ethylene is another example of steric rather than electronic control of the reaction. Conclusions X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ESCA) have proved to be versatile methods for elucidating the electronic 126 structure of organotransition metal complexes. With ESCA in particular, it was possible to find correlations in activity as well as selectivity patterns for a homologous series of nickel olefin-oligomerization catalysts. The arguments agree with previous EHT MO calculations. Since ESCA spectra provide information solely on the electron density at the coordination center, it was possible to separate the electronic from the steric ligand effects on a quantitative basis.

Weber Center for Catalytic Science and Technology, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19711 U.S.A. A series of five one-component catalysts has been investigated: (η3-C8H13)Ni(CH3COCHCOCH3) (1a), (η3-C8H13)Ni(CF3COCHCOCH3) (1b), (η3-C8H13)Ni(CF3COCHCOCF3) (1c), (PPh3)C6H5Ni(PPh2CHCOPh) (2) and (η3-C8H13)Ni(PPh2CH2COO) (3). Their catalytic activity and selectivity in the oligomerization of small alkenes are discussed: 1 catalyzes the dimerization of but-1-ene to 80% linear octenes (turnover number at 75 °C for 1c: 0.2 s−1); 2 and 3 oligomerize ethylene to 99% linear α-olefins in the C4 - C20 range (turnover number at 75 °C for 3: 0.8 s−1). Compound 3 is a model for the catalyst system employed in the SHELL-Higher-Olefins-Process. K-edge XAS and ESCA spectra of 1–3 show square-planar d8-configuration in all cases and allow an inverse volcano-type correlation between ESCA chemical shifts and catalytic activity and selectivity. A mechanistic explanation with regard to the insertion step and the chain growth terminating β-H elimination reaction is undertaken. References 1 W. Keim B. Hoffmann R. Lodewick M. Peuckert G.
