Avon Lake, Ohio 44012, USA Received 2 August 1994; revised 17 November 1994; accepted 18 November 1994 Abstract Acrylonitrile has been converted catalytically to the straight chain dimer, 1,4-dicyanobutene- 1, for the first time with both high selectivity to the linear dimer and in high yield on acrylonitrile consumed. The catalyst is an aromatic phosphinite or phosphonite, in a reaction medium which contains alcohol, hydrocarbon and acrylonitrile, and which must be purified rigorously from traces of water and phenolic stabilisers normally present in commercial acrylonitrile, otherwise catalyst deactivation results. The catalysts were discovered during detailed investigations into the activities of related heterogeneous catalysts which had also been discovered to give high selectivities to the linear dimer, but in a poorly reproducible manner. The dimerisation is thought to proceed via the formation of ylid and betaine intermediates derived from the addition of the phosphorus derivative to acrylonitrile. The factors affecting catalyst performance and selectivity are discussed.

Introduction This paper introduces a study [ 1-3] into the catalytic, linear dimerisation of acrylonitrile, a potential new route for adiponitrile production. Initial work on heterogeneous catalysts led to the discovery of a homogeneous phosphinite-based catalyst system. In this paper, trivalent phosphorus catalysts are reviewed and the discovery of the homogeneous catalysts discussed, together with the effects of variation of solvent, co-solvent, temperature, time and catalyst type. * Corresponding author.

Jennings, R.J. Cozens/Applied Catalysis A: General 124 (1995)297-315 The catalytic linear dimerisation of acrylonitrile, CH2=CHCN, and subsequent hydrogenation of the resultant dinitrile, NCCH---CHCH2CH2CN, constitutes a potentially efficient route for the synthesis of adiponitrile, NC(CH2)4CN. The electrohydrodimerisation of acrylonitrile forms the basis of the Monsanto process [4,5] for adiponitrile, but prior to this work, no successful catalytic method had been discovered. Ruthenium compounds in the presence of hydrogen [6,7] catalyze the direct formation of adiponitrile, but the simultaneous formation of stoichio- metric amounts of propionitrile renders this process uneconomic. Hydrolysis of the reaction products [8] from acrylonitrile, cobalt chloride and manganese metal yields adiponitrile in a single stage reaction, but only in stoichiometric amounts on the metal consumed. These reactions and others are reviewed elsewhere [9]. The ability of phosphines to catalyze the polymerisation of acrylonitrile was reported in 1955 [ 10]. The principal product of triarylphosphine-catalyzed oligo- merisation of acrylonitrile, in the presence of an alcohol under relatively severe conditions was later claimed [11] to be a hexameric species, NCC (CH2CH2CN) 2CH=CHC (CH2CH2CN) 2CN, formed via the linear dimeric intermediate dicyanobutene-2, and the mechanism of its formation was also dis- cussed. The ability of phosphines to catalyze the discreet, branched chain dimer- i sation of acrylic compounds was later reported [ 12 ], and the controlled production of 1,3-dicyanobutene-1, CH2=C(CN)CH2CH2CN, from acrylonitrile was achieved [ 13] by carrying out the reaction under relatively mild conditions in the presence of weakly acidic proton donors such as water or tert-butanol. Small amounts of the linear dimers 1,4-dicyanobutene-1, NCCH=CHCH2CH2CN, and 1,4-dicyanobutene-2, NCCH2CH=CHCH2CN, were also found among the prod- ucts of such reactions. The efficiency of this discreet dimerisation was postulated to be improved by employing acrylonitrile stabilised against polymerisation [ 13,14]. Later work [ 15-17] on the effect of the choice of nucleophilic phosphine catalyst, protolytic solvent and reaction conditions on the observed product distri- butions showed that enhanced selectivity to the linear dimer could be achieved. Yields of up to 30% dicyanobutene-1 were obtained under optimised reaction conditions. A number of reports [18-23] subsequently claimed improved phos- phine- or phosphite-catalyzed dimerisation processes, which operated at faster rates and with higher selectivities to either the linear or branched dimers. Experiments to trap intermediate phosphonium ylids in the dimerisation reaction [24,25] gave Wittig-type products only under significantly more severe reaction conditions than were required for efficient dimerisation. The use of phosphinites, R2POR', and phosphonites RP(OR')2, as catalysts for the linear dimerisation of acrylonitrile was claimed in a general patent [26], where many compounds were included in an extensive list of potential catalysts. However, the actual application of these compounds was not described. Indeed, as shown later in this paper, phosphinites and phosphonites would have been rapidly deac- tivated under the reaction conditions employed. The use of diaryl-, Ar2POR', and arylalkylphosphinites, Ar(R)POR', for the dimerisation of stabilised acrylonitrile J.R. Jennings, R.J. Cozens/Applied Catalysis A: General 124 (1995) 297-315 299 was later reported [ 27 ]. The conversions of acrylonitrile were low and considerable yields of undesirable hexamer and polymer were obtained in most of the examples presented. Selectivities to linear dimer were not recorded. In this paper, the efficient and selective linear dimerisation of acrylonitrile, catalyzed by alkyl diphenylphosphinites and dialkyl arylphosphonites under mild conditions in the presence of an alcohol, employing stabiliser-free and rigorously dried reaction mixtures is described. An essential feature of the catalyst is that aromatic rather than aliphatic hydrocarbyl groups must be bound to the phosphorus atom, otherwise selectivity to the linear dimer is severely reduced. Related heter- ogeneous phosphorus catalysts which led to the discovery of the homogeneous catalysts are also briefly discussed. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation of reagents 2.1.1. Acrylonitrile Commercial acrylonitrile was pre-dried for 24 h over finely ground calcium hydride and decanted into a still under an atmosphere of nitrogen, where it was refluxed for six hours over fresh calcium hydride. The acrylonitrile was distilled on to freshly activated 3A molecular sieves for storage. All subsequent transfers of acrylonitrile were made using glass syringes, entry to the storage vessel being made via a protected rubber serum cap. 2.1.2. Alcohols Reagent grade secondary and tertiary alcohols were refluxed over finely ground calcium hydride for six hours under an atmosphere of nitrogen, after which they were distilled directly onto 3A molecular sieves in storage flasks, where they were stored and handled as described in Section 2.1.1. above. 2.1.3. Inert co-solvents Reagent grade hydrocarbon solvents were pre-dried over sodium wire for 24 h, then refluxed over fresh sodium or sodium wire until dry, as indicated by the development of colour in added benzophenone or 2,2'-bipyridyl. The solvents were then distilled directly onto freshly activated 3A molecular sieves in glass flasks, for storage as in Section 2.1.1. above. 2.1.4. Phosphinites and phosphonites Methyl diphenylphosphinite Ph2POMe, ethyl diphenylphosphinite Ph2POEt, dimethyl phenylphosphonite PbPO(Me) 2, diethyl tolylphosphonite (tolyl) P (OEt) 2, dimethyl tolylphosphinite ( tolyl ) P ( OMe ) 2, diphenylphosphinous chlo- ride PhRPCI, and phenylphosphinous dichloride PhPCI2 were purchased from May- 300 J.R. Jennings, R.J. Cozens/Applied Catalysis A: General 124 (1995) 297-315 bridge Chemicals and used as received. The tolyl derivatives consisted of a mixture of the ortho and para isomers, of unknown distribution. Other phosphinites were prepared by the conventional reaction [ 28 ] of diphenylphosphinous chloride with the appropriate alcohol in the presence of dimethylaniline. 3. Preparation of supported phosphorus catalysts 3.1. Reaction between Ph2POP/ and silica Silica (Davison 952 grade; 54 g) was pre-dried in a muffle furnace at different temperatures in the range 150-600 and allowed to cool under an atmosphere of nitrogen. The silica was added to a stirred solution of isopropyl diphenylphosphinite (32 g; 0.13 mol) in toluene (300 ml) and the mixture refluxed for eight hours. Samples of the mixture were examined by infrared spectroscopy to monitor the extent of the interaction. At the end of the reaction period, the silica product was filtered, washed with toluene to remove free or weakly bound phosphinite and dried in a muffle furnace at 60 for two hours. This reaction sequence was carried out similarly for other phosphinites (e.g. PhEtPOMe and Ph2POMe), using both silica and alumina as the support material. 3.2. Reaction between Ph2PCl and alumina Powdered y-alumina (median particle size 160-180/~m; 150 g) was dried in a muffle furnace at 600 for six hours and cooled under an atmosphere of dry nitrogen. The alumina was added to a solution of diphenylphosphinous chloride (31 g; 0.14 mol) in hexane (300 ml) and the mixture refluxed for three hours. Hexane was removed at reduced pressure and the remaining solid dried in vacuo. 3.3. Catalyst testing The catalysts were held in a tubular reactor, heated to about 200 and exposed to vapour from commercial unpurified acrylonitrile using nitrogen as carrier gas. The products were analyzed by on-line gas chromatography. In the case of the catalyst derived from diphenylphosphinous chloride, no dimeric products were obtained. Linear and branched dimers, together with polymeric material, were obtained from all of the other catalysts under similar experimental conditions, but the results were not always reproducible. Selectivity to the linear dimer was gen- erally about 75%, but the yields of dimeric product were generally below 5%. 3.4. Homogeneous testing Glass conical flasks, sealed with rubber serum caps were used for almost all of the experimental work described. The reaction vessel, after drying in an oven ( 800 J.R. Jennings, R.J. Cozens/Applied Catalysis A: General 124 (1995) 297-315 301 100) for two hours was first degassed thoroughly with nitrogen and the appro- priate quantities of acrylonitrile, alcohol and inert co-solvent were added individually by syringe transfer from their storage vessels. The catalyst was then injected, using a syringe or micro-syringe and the vessel immersed in a thermos- tatted bath held at the reaction temperature. The reaction was allowed to progress for the desired time, after which the vessel was removed from the bath and the contents analyzed as described below. The reaction products were treated with an equal volume of aqueous acetone to destroy the catalyst and to prevent further reaction from taking place. The mixture was then filtered through a pre-weighed sintered glass crucible to separate the hexamer from the product. The hexamer was washed in situ with 20 ml acetone, dried in an oven at 100 to constant weight and weighed. The combined filtrate and acetone washings were combined and evaporated using a rotary evaporator at 40-50 until a constant weight of high boiling, viscous oils was obtained. This procedure removes all of the unreacted acrylonitrile and low-boiling solvents. The oily residue was weighed and an accurately weighed quantity of adiponitrile was added as the internal standard for subsequent gas-chromatographic analysis. The mixture was diluted with acetone to reduce the viscosity and the analysis required a 5-foot column containing 2.5% LAC 3R728 on embacil, operating at 170 with a carrier gas flow-rate of ca. 50 ml min ~. Such analyses provided a direct measure of the contents of 1,3-dicyanobutene- 1, cis- and trans-dicyanobutene- 1, and dicy- anobutene-2. The quantity of catalyst in the high-boiling residues was subtracted, the quantity of hexamer added to the products weight, and the yield of oligomers finally determined by subtraction. The results are given in tabular form in the text. 3.5. Estimation of dimerisation reaction rate The estimations were based on the total observed conversion of acrylonitrile. The reaction was recognised to be first order in catalyst concentration, but the dependence on the acrylonitrile concentration was not accurately known. Thus representative rates, which enabled direct comparison of the performance of each catalyst, were estimated from the observed conversion of acrylonitrile At (%), after a reaction time of t seconds, as follows: Rate= ln((100-At)/100) lm Is- [catalyst] 3.6. Estimation of the linear dimer productivi~ of catalysts Productivity is defined as the ratio of the number of moles of linear dimer produced to the number of moles of catalyst employed in the reaction. Since stability of the catalyst was not monitored in these experiments, productivity figures always 302 J.R. Jennings, R.J. Cozens/Applied Catalysis A: General 124 (1995) 297-315 tended to underestimate the performance of the more stable catalysts since only part of the catalyst may have become deactivated during the course of reaction. 3.7. Isolation of cyanoethyldiphenylphosphine oxide A dimerisation reaction comprising acrylonitrile, tert-butanol and methyl diphen- ylphosphinite was terminated by addition of excess water. Volatiles were removed on a rotary evaporator, leaving a solid residue which was recrystallised from ace- tone. This product was demonstrated to be cyanoethyldiphenylphosphine oxide by mixed melting points and by comparison of both infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra with an authentic sample. 4. Discussion 4.1. Preparation of heterogeneous phosphorus catalysts The use of supported phosphines, rather than homogeneous trialkyl- or triaryl- phosphines for the catalytic dimerisation of acrylonitrile was believed to provide a large degree of flexibility for both the nucleophilicity and the stereochemistry of the phosphorus atom with the practical advantages of ease of catalyst separation and product purification. Since homogeneous dimerisation of acrylonitrile cata- lyzed by phosphines produces the branched chain product, in this study, it was hoped to adjust the catalyst parameters such that liner dimer formation would be optimised. Emphasis in this phase was initially placed on the relatively unexplored area of developing heterogeneous phosphorus(III) catalysts linked to silica or alumina supports. A limited number of publications concerning the preparation and/or utilisation of P-O-Si bonds have appeared in the chemical literature. For example, the prep- aration of silyl phosphinites of the types R2POSiR3, (RaPO) 2SIR2, and (R2PO) 3SiR have been reported [29,30] and bis(trifluoromethyl)phosphinoxysilanes, e.g. ( CF3 ) 2POSiR3, R = H, Me; [ (CF3) 2PO ] 3Sill and [ (CF3) 2PO ] 4Si have been syn- thesised via group exchange methods [ 31 ]. Since the P-O-Si bond was reported to be quite stable towards disproportionation to P-O-P or Si-O-Si bonds in these complexes, it was decided to attempt the preparation of silica- or alumina-linked phosphines and to test them for activity towards acrylonitrile dimerisation. The direct addition of dialkyl or diaryl phosphinous chlorides to silica resulted in products heavily contaminated by hydrogen chloride. Reactions were difficult to drive to completion, and the use of tertiary amines to promote a more efficient reaction resulted in a difficult separation of the sparingly soluble amine hydrochlo- ride from the catalyst. The use of phosphinites and phosphonites proved to be more successful. For example, diphenyl phosphinous chloride was converted to isopropyl diphenylphosphinite by reaction with isopropanol in the presence of triethylamine J.R. Jennings, R.J. Cozens/Applied Catalysis A.\" General 124 (1995) 297-315 303 and the resulting phosphinite was subsequently bound to silica by refluxing the reagents in hydrocarbon solvents. Methylphosphinites could also be used and methyl diphenylphosphinite and methyl phenylethylphosphinite were both bound to silica by refluxing the reagents in hexane solvent. The projected preparative route can be represented as follows: N R\"OH ~ SiOH J RR'PCI ..~ RR'POR\" Et~N hexane R x / ) ~sioex + R\"OH R' (R. R' = Et, Ph; R\" = Me, Pri) These supported catalysts were not fully characterised and no attempt was made to demonstrate the presence of the Si-O-P linkage. The possibility that the inter- action between phosphinite and support was merely by chemisorption was not excluded. 4.2. Testing of the heterogeneous phosphorus catalysts Catalysts were tested under two sets of conditions. In the first method, liquid acrylonitrile was pumped under pressure into a high-temperature vaporiser and through a bed of catalyst, using high-pressure nitrogen as carrier gas. The reaction product was analyzed by on-line gas chromatography. The second test method involved simply refluxing the acrylonitrile in contact with the catalyst. The acry- lonitrile was used as received from BDH, without purification. The supported catalysts SiOPPhz and SiOPPhEt were tested extensively under high pressure. Generally, from 5 to 50 g of the powdered catalyst was used under the following conditions: Temperature: 110-180 Pressure: 50-200 psig Nitrogen rate: 300-400 ml min- Acrylonitrile rate: 4.0-17 g min-J High selectivities to linear dimer were frequently obtained, but the data varied in a random manner for seemingly identical batches of catalyst. The best of the results were better than any previously reported in the chemical and patent literature for the use of homogeneous catalysts. Linear: branched ratios of up to 3:1 were frequently observed, compared with an average of 1:1 from literature reports. Reflux tests, either with or without a proton donor, achieved similar results, again varying randomly. A selection of results showing the effect of support calcination temper- ature on linearity is given in Table 1. The overall yield of dimers was very low. 304 J.R.

Further detailed study of unused silica-supported catalysts by infrared spectros- copy revealed the presence of aliphatic C-H bonds on the silica surface, suggesting either that some of the phosphorus compound was held by chemisorption as the phosphinite, or the alcohol liberated underwent further reaction with the silica surface. The latter proposal was considered to be unlikely and appears that the active catalyst was simply chemisorbed phosphinite, not completely removed by washing, which provides a rationale for the random results obtained in the test program. The strongly diagnostic P=O stretching vibration around 1200 cm- J was absent from the spectra, indicating that oxidation to the pV species had not occurred. Following this work, homogeneous tests of large quantities of methyl diphen- ylphosphinite with distilled acrylonitrile free from the polymerisation inhibitor and in the absence of solvent, was carried out. In most cases, the reaction yielded a minor amount of dimeric product, most of which (80-95%) was linear. However, when the acrylonitrile had been pre-dried as described in the experimental section, extremely violent polymerisation occurred in the presence of even small quantities of phosphinite. Dilution of the acrylonitrile with an equal volume of dry tert-butanol promoted a very facile dimerisation reaction which yielded 1,4-dicyanobutene- 1 at high conversions of acrylonitrile together with some minor co-products. These latter observations resulted in a total change in the research programme from heterogeneous to homogeneous catalysis. Further work on the heterogeneous cat- alysts was suspended. 4.3. Homogeneous catalysis The homogeneous catalyst system, derived from the examination of the hetero- geneous catalysts mentioned above, consists in its simplest form of a phosphinite, Ar2POR or a phosphonite ArP (OR) 2, an alcohol and acrylonitrile. The hydrocarbyl group bound to the phosphorus atom must be aromatic, otherwise the selectivity to the linear dimer is reduced. The alcohol is preferably secondary or tertiary to minimise the simultaneous formation of the alkylcyanoethyl ether, ROCH2CH2CN, by the addition reaction of an alcohol to acrylonitrile.

Hydrocarbons can be added to modify the dielectric constant of the reaction medium. This has the effect of reducing the rate of reaction and changing the product distribution of the dimer fraction. The product from each dimerisation reaction was a mixture containing cis- and trans- 1,4-dicyanobutene- 1, DCB- 1, 1,4- dicyanobutene-2, DCB-2, 1,3-dicyanobutene-1, MEGN, a crystalline solid con- sisting mainly of hexa-acrylonitrile with a little solid polymer and some oily oligomers of acrylonitrile. The hexamer was identical to that reported by Takashima and Price [6] and could be prepared by the phosphinite-catalyzed insertion of acrylonitrile into the four activated C-H bonds of 1,4-dicyanobutene-2, as shown below. It is possible that the hexamer could arise by the same route in the current dimerisation system. NCCH2CH=CHCH2CN + 4CH =CHCN, CN I V (CH2CH2CN)2 CH CH I ~ (CH2CH2CN)2 CN The dimerisation reaction is mechanistically similar [8] to the trialkylphos- phine/acrylonitrile reaction where the addition of alcohols to the reaction mixture prevents explosive polymerisation, in favour of a controlled dimerisation reaction. However, there are two key differences. The main product of the phosphinite/ phosphonite-catalyzed reaction is a linear dimer and the reaction is particularly sensitive to hydrolytic species of higher reactivity than alcohols. Thus, even traces of water or phenolic stabilisers can completely destroy the small amounts of catalyst required for effective dimerisation. Earlier studies [ 8 ] of the phosphine-catalyzed reaction led to the proposal that the dimerisation reaction proceeded via the revers- 306 J.R. Jennings, R.J.

Linear and branched dimer were assumed to result from addition of further acrylonitrile to the ylid and betaine, respectively, as shown below: Ar3P + CH2=CHCN.

The phosphine oxide was thought to arise from hydrolysis of the catalyst by traces of water in the reaction mixture. Each discreet variable in the dimerisation reaction was then studied separately for its effect on the rate of dimerisation, the selectivity to linear dimer, the yield of dimer, and finally catalyst stability. This is discussed below. 4.4. Effect of water As indicated earlier, water strongly inhibits the dimerisation reaction and can be used to terminate reactions proceeding normally. Removal of solvent and acrylo- nitrile from a reaction mixture terminated by water addition yielded cyanoethyl- diphenylphosphine oxide, Ph2P(=O) CH2CH2CN, probably formed by hydrolysis of a phosphonium ylid intermediate: Ph2POR + CH2=CHCN --+ Ph2P(OR) CH2-CHCN ~-- Ph2P(OR) CHCH2CN Ph2 (P=O) CH2CH2CN J.R.

Cozens/Applied Catalysis A: General 124 (1995) 297-315 307 This contrasts strongly with the behaviour of phosphines where the presence of water enhances the rate of the dimerisation reaction. While it is seen that hydroxyl groups are required to promote proton transfers between the intermediates involved in the dimerisation reaction, it appears that the activity of the hydroxyl group must not be too great, otherwise decomposition of the reaction intermediates to catalyt- ically inactive pV species results. 4.5. Variation of the phosphorus catalyst In the early stages of the work, reactions were terminated by addition of water/ acetone mixtures after a given period of time. Catalyst activity was interpreted purely in terms of the observed conversion of acrylonitrile this time. The result of a series of dimerisation reactions employing a range of alkyl diphenylphosphinites, Ph2POR, at reflux temperature is given in Table 2. It can readily be seen that phenyl diphenylphosphinite, PhzPOPh, and diphen- ylphosphinous acid, PhzPOH, are quite inactive as catalysts. Diphenylphosphinous acid, existing essentially as the pV secondary phosphine oxide, Ph2P(=O)H, readily adds across the double bond in acrylonitrile to give inactive cyanoethyldiphenyl- phosphine oxide, whereas phenyl diphenylphosphinite fails to catalyze the dimer- isation because rapid transesterification with the alcohol solvent liberates the strongly acidic phenol, which degrades the catalyst in a similar manner to water. Similarly, trimethylsilyl diphenylphosphinite also exhibits zero activity. The P-O- Allyl function was also found to be relatively inactive, otherwise all of the phos- phinites had comparable activity within the limits of accuracy of the screening programme. This similarity in behaviour is consistent with rapid transesterification of the phosphinites by the tertiary butanol solvent, producing PhzPOBut as a com- mon active species. This would be likely to have a limited stability due to an elimination reaction resulting in evolution of isobutene and the simultaneous for- mation of an inert pV species. The enhanced stability of the isopropyl derivative is due to steric effects, causing a lower rate of transesterification, relative to its methyl and ethyl homologues. In Table 3, the progress of some dimerisation reactions employing a series of related dialkyl arylphosphonites, ArP(OR)2 at different temperatures and reaction times, is illustrated. The dialkyl tolylphosphonites were commercial materials of uncertain isomer distribution but are likely to consist of a mixture of the ortho and para isomers. It can be seen from the overall conversions of acrylonitrile that there appears to be some rate advantage in the use of the ethoxy rather than the methoxy derivatives, a feature also reflected in the calculated productivity figures for linear dimer formation. A study of the transesterification reaction of phosphonites was not made, but it might be expected, by analogy with the behaviour of phosphinites, that at least some of the active species in the present reactions would contain butoxy groups. The stability of such species under dimerisation reaction conditions is not known, but the likely presence of two tertiary butoxy groups on a single phosphorus 308 J.R. Jennings, R.J.

In general, the apparent overall rate of dimerisation was faster with phosphinites than with the corresponding phosphonites under comparable reaction conditions, as supported by the data in Tables 2 and 3. The phosphinite, Ph2POPra, emerged from the early experimentation as a preferred catalyst species. Within a given series of catalysts, there was little difference in the selectivity to the linear dimer1. However, there was a slight tendency towards increased selectiv- ity to linear dimers when methyl and ethyl phosphinite derivatives were employed. Similarly, the use of phosphonites also resulted in a marginal selectivity improve- ment. The yield of linear dimers, however, was consistently greater for phosphinites (50-55%) than for the analogous phosphonites under the reaction conditions cho- sen. Since the levels of hexamer formation were rather similar, the differences in yield may have been due to different degrees of oligomerisation of acrylonitrile induced by the two types of catalyst. The overall conversion of acrylonitrile was directly proportional to catalyst loading for both phosphinites and phosphonites under standard reaction conditions. However, at low catalyst loading ( 10-3 M), even prolonged dimerisation reactions failed to achieve acceptable levels of acrylonitrile conversion, presumably due to deactivation of the catalyst. At high catalyst concentrations (ca. 0.1 M), signifi- cantly lower yields of linear dimers were obtained due to the formation of liquid oligomers, by interaction of excess catalyst with the dimeric product. Intermediate concentrations gave consistent yields. Within experimental error, there was no Selectivity to the linear dimer is defined as the percentage of linear dimer in the dimer fraction and disregards the formation of higher molecular weight material. Yields are calculated on total acrylonitrile consumed. J.R. Jennings, R.J.

Variation of acrylonitrile concentration From the results of early work, an increase in the initial concentration of acry- lonitrile (other parameters remaining constant) resulted in an acceleration of the observed rate of dimerisation. The magnitude of this effect was approximately first order and was thought to be associated with a rate-determining second stage addition of acrylonitrile to the betaine and ylid. Failure to observe directly the betaine or ylid was regarded as supportive of a mechanism whose initial interaction between catalyst and acrylonitrile was a rapid reversible process, the equilibrium lying almost entirely on the side of the reactants. Later studies have revealed that the initial interaction is rate determining and that the rate of the dimerisation reaction depends upon the concentration of the acrylonitrile to the first order. This will be reported later. An increase in the initial concentration of acrylonitrile generally resulted in a slight decrease in the ultimate yield of linear dimers obtained, as shown in Table 4. This lowering of yield is considered to result from the higher dimerisation rate arising from the increase in the dielectric of the medium which accompanies the increased acrylonitrile concentration. Yield and selectivity are influenced by the magnitude of the dimerisation reaction rate for any combination of catalyst and reaction conditions. At high rates of dimerisation, the addition of the second mole of acrylonitrile becomes fast relative to the betaine/ylid equilibration reaction, with a resulting decrease in selectivity to the linear dimer. Furthermore, selectivity is generally found to be dependent upon the overall dielectric of the reaction medium. Low dielectrics favour linear dimer formation, though the reasons for this obser- vation are not known. Variation in acrylonitrile concentration appeared to have no adverse effect on catalyst stability. 310 J.R. Jennings, R.J. Cozens/Applied Catalysis A: General 124 (1995) 297-315 5. Variation in the nature of the alcohol Alcohols are known to undergo a base-catalyzed reaction with acrylonitrile [ 32 ], known as cyanoethylation: base ROH+ CH2=CHCN ~ ROCHzCH2CN The order of reactivity is primary > secondary > tertiary. Consequently, pri- mary alcohols were not considered as proton sources for the dimerisation reaction and tert-butanol was used for most of the initial experimentation in equi-volume mixtures with acrylonitrile. Mechanistic studies [ 33 ], at a later stage of the project revealed that t-butoxy groups bound to the phosphorus intermediate promoted catalyst deactivation and that secondary alcohols were preferred for optimum sta- bility. The use of isopropanol as proton source and isopropyldiarylphosphinites, ArE POPP, thus became routinely adopted. This change resulted in higher conver- sions of acrylonitrile being obtained. Cyanoethylation of isopropanol was not observed to any measurable extent under optimised dimerisation conditions. In the absence of alcohols, phosphinite- and phosphonite-catalyzed reactions of acrylonitrile gave little dimeric product as shown in Table 5. Experimentation revealed that there was little to choose between t-butanol and isopropanol in terms of the selectivity of the catalyst to linear dimer formation. The effects observed on changing the concentration of the alcohol are difficult to interpret since other factors were also changing. It is not possible to replace an alcohol with a totally inert material of comparable dielectric. Thus varying the alcohol concentration resulted in changes in dielectric and/or the concentrations of catalyst and acrylonitrile. The results shown in Table 4 illustrate the effect obtained by changing the alcohol concentration in a series of dimerisation reactions at 60, containing constant volumes of acrylonitrile, toluene and catalyst. From consideration of the overall conversion of acrylonitrile, it is apparent that an increase in the alcohol concentra- Table 5 Optimisation of isopropanol loading for the phosphinite Ph2POPP Isopropanol (ml) Yield Yield Yield Yield oils Linearity (%) Acrylonitrile MEGN (%) DCB 1/2 hexamer (%) (%) conversion (%) 0 0.1 0.4 90\" 9.7 83 61 2 2.5 64 12 21 96 58 4 2.1 46 31 21 96 81 6 2.3 44 30 24 95 78 8 2.5 42 29 26 95 78 10 2.7 45 32 20 94 73 o All reactions at 20 C for three hours.

In the absence of alcohol but in the presence of toluene, a measurable conversion of acrylonitrile does occur but the principal product of the reaction is solid polymer. As the concentration of the isopropanol is increased, dimeric products predominate and the conversion increases. At higher concentrations of isopropanol, the observed conversion figures begin to fall slightly, possibly due to enhanced catalyst deacti- vation via alcoholysis. The alcohol is not believed to be directly involved in the rate determining step of the dimerisation reaction. The product distribution data of Fig. 1 and Tables 4 and 5 suggest that an optimum concentration of isopropanol exists for effective dimerisation. This concentration was found subsequently to be ca. 0.9 M for mixtures of isopropanol, acrylonitrile and toluene. Below this concentration the overall production of linear dimer is poor. Above this concentration, the dimerisation reaction proceeds smoothly but is 312 J.R. Jennings, R.J. Cozens/Applied Catalysis A: General 124 (1995) 297-315 accompanied by a decrease in the yield of linear dimer and an increase in the formation of hexamer and oligomers. The increase in dielectric of the reaction medium resulting from the higher concentration of alcohol appears to be responsible for this effect, but the chemical process by which this occurs is not understood. The linearity of the dimeric product is little affected by changes in the concentration of the alcohol. Though not quantified, an alcoholysis reaction of the catalytic inter- mediate leads to catalyst decay and it seems probable that high alcohol concentra- tions promote catalyst deactivation. The mechanism is not fully understood, though the process occurs at a rate exhibiting first-order dependence on the catalyst con- centration in the range 10- ' to 10-3 M. The optimum concentration of isopropanol for linear dimer formation has generally been found to result in quite low rates of alcoholysis for the most preferred phosphinite catalysts (i.e. 0.1-0.4 tool-% h-l). 6. Variation of the co-solvent In the early stages of the project, dimerisation reactions were carried out in equi- volume mixtures of acrylonitrile and t-butanol. Optimisation of the reaction para- meters produced rather disappointing yields of linear dimers (60-75%) while the selectivity to the linear dimer was good, ranging between 85 and 95%. Different co-solvents were employed to modify the polarity of the reaction medium and hydrocarbons, ethers and nitriles were tested. The co-solvents were initially used on an equi-volume basis with the acrylonitrile and t-butanol. Faster rates of reaction but lower yields of dimer were obtained from polar co-solvents. Hydrocarbons produced the opposite effect and toluene emerged as an attractive co-solvent, offering an acceptable compromise between rate, yield and selectivity. In Table 6, the influence of toluene on the product distribution and reaction rate is compared with results from cyclohexane. It can be seen that the reactions in toluene are consistently faster than those in cyclohexane and, surprisingly, also give higher yields of dimers. Similar conclusions are obtained from the data in Table 7, and the performance of Ph2POPentylneis also noteworthy.

However, it would be expected that polar solvents would be more deleterious to catalyst stability than non-polar solvents and toluene was found to give acceptable results. The optimum composition of the reaction medium, namely that offering the best com- promise between rate, selectivity, yield and catalyst stability contained acrylonitrile, isopropanol and toluene in the volume ratio 3:1:10. 7. Variation of temperature Virtually all catalysts exhibited faster dimerisation rates at slightly elevated temperatures. Below 20, the reactions were impractically slow and above 80, poor conversions of acrylonitrile were observed, due to catalyst deactivation. The practical working range was thus established as 20-60. The improvement obtained in linear dimer productivity at 60 in comparison with that at 20, all other factors remaining constant, is shown in Tables 2 and 3. Slightly reduced yields (ca. 1-3%) of linear dimers were consistently obtained at the higher temperature, as reflected by higher yields of hexamer and oligomers. Selectivity to the linear dimer was also slightly reduced (ca. 1-2%). These effects were more pronounced in reaction mixtures containing high concentrations of alcohol and acrylonitrile. Catalysts were generally quite stable within the temperature range 20-60. Above 80, the extent of alcoholysis accelerated significantly and at 105, only traces of dimer were detected in a reaction mixture. This effect was not studied further. 8. Variation of reaction time Increased reaction times resulted in a decrease in the yield of linear dimers with a corresponding increase in the formation of undesirable by-products. These effects 314 J.R. Jennings, R.J. Cozens~Applied Catalysis A: General 124 (1995) 297-315 were more pronounced at higher concentrations of catalyst and at higher tempera- tures. The trend to higher yields of hexamer is illustrated by the data in Tables 2 and 3. A possible reason for these observations is that, as the free acrylonitrile concentration falls to low values, particularly in the presence of high concentrations of catalyst, the potential for further reaction between the catalyst and the dimeric products, leading to the formation of oligomers is increased significantly. Catalyst deactivation is a slow process, especially under optimised reaction conditions, but nevertheless still occurs at a finite rate even in the presence of low concentrations of acrylonitrile. Thus the longer a reaction proceeds, the more the catalyst is deactivated and lower dimer productivities per mole of catalyst added are obtained. The optimum reaction time is thus a compromise between that required to achieve maximum conversion of acrylonitrile and that at which the loss of active catalyst becomes excessive relative to the formation of dimers. It is clearly vital to separate catalyst from product as soon as this stage is reached. 9. Conclusions 1 Aromatic phosphonites and phosphinites are effective catalysts for the linear dimerisation of acrylonitrile. 2 The presence of alcohol is essential, otherwise acrylonitrile polymerisation results. 3 The catalyst system is very sensitive to traces of water and phenolic stabilisers, which cause stoichiometric deactivation of the catalyst. 4 Increasing temperature increases the rate of dimerisation, but above 60, the rate of deactivation of the catalyst becomes significant. 5 The nature of the alkoxide group on the catalyst has only slight effects on the rate of reaction and product linearity, but has a major influence on catalyst stability.

Acrylonitrile has been converted catalytically to the straight chain dimer, 1,4-dicyanobutene-1, for the first time with both high selectivity to the linear dimer and in high yield on acrylonitrile consumed. The catalyst is an aromatic phosphinite or phosphonite, in a reaction medium which contains alcohol, hydrocarbon and acrylonitrile, and which must be purified rigorously from traces of water and phenolic stabilisers normally present in commercial acrylonitrile, otherwise catalyst deactivation results. The catalysts were discovered during detailed investigations into the activities of related heterogeneous catalysts which had also been discovered to give high selectivities to the linear dimer, but in a poorly reproducible manner. The dimerisation is thought to proceed via the formation of ylid and betaine intermediates derived from the addition of the phosphorus derivative to acrylonitrile. The factors affecting catalyst performance and selectivity are discussed.

        "dc:description": "Acrylonitrile has been converted catalytically to the straight chain dimer, 1,4-dicyanobutene-1, for the first time with both high selectivity to the linear dimer and in high yield on acrylonitrile consumed. The catalyst is an aromatic phosphinite or phosphonite, in a reaction medium which contains alcohol, hydrocarbon and acrylonitrile, and which must be purified rigorously from traces of water and phenolic stabilisers normally present in commercial acrylonitrile, otherwise catalyst deactivation results. The catalysts were discovered during detailed investigations into the activities of related heterogeneous catalysts which had also been discovered to give high selectivities to the linear dimer, but in a poorly reproducible manner. The dimerisation is thought to proceed via the formation of ylid and betaine intermediates derived from the addition of the phosphorus derivative to acrylonitrile. The factors affecting catalyst performance and selectivity are discussed.",
