Co/SBA-15 was synthesized and applied as catalyst for aerobic oxidative desulfurization (AODS). Co species was successfully introduced into the framework without destroy the mesoporous structure of SBA-15. The reaction conditions of Co/SBA-15 for AODS were optimized, and the desulfurization rate could reach 99.5% at the mild reaction temperature of 30 °C. It was proposed that dibenzothiophene was adsorbed on the Lewis acid sites of Co/SBA-15, and then oxidized to the polar sulfone by superoxide radicals generated from the oxygen molecule.

Thus, reducing the content of sulfide in fossil fuel is very important for the prevention of air pollution. Traditional hydrodesulfurization requires harsh reaction conditions, and deep desulfurization of thiophene and thiophene derivatives is difficult [1]. In the past decades, oxidative desulfurization was considered as one of the most promising desulfurization techniques, due to its mild operating conditions and high desulfurization efficiency [2,3]. Oxidative desulfurization usually used hydrogen peroxide as oxidant, the storage and transformation of hydrogen peroxide oxidant is complicated and dangerous, which inhibit the industrial application of oxidative desulfurization. In recent years, aerobic oxidative desulfurization (AODS) has attracted significant attention. Molecular oxygen as an oxidant of AODS because it is environmentally safe, low cost and with high atomic economy [4]. However, the desulfurization rate of AODS is much lower than that of hydrogen peroxide, due to the high activation energy of oxygen molecule. The mechanism of AODS has been well investigated, and it was proposed that oxygen can be activated into superoxide radical to oxidize dibenzothiophene [5]. Electron spin resonance and radical quenching tests confirmed the generation of superoxide radical intermediate species on polyoxometalate catalyst [6]. The most popular catalyst used for AODS was polyoxometalate catalyst. Lv et al. reported that Co polyanion could improve the catalytic performance of homogeneous Mo-based polyoxometallates catalysts for AODS, and the enhanced catalytic performance was related to the mixed-valence of molybdenum ions in Anderson polyoxometalate [7,8]. After that, Yang et al. reported that Co species in the catalyst could activate O2 and generate superoxide radicals, Mo oxides adsorbed dibenzothiophene, CoMo bimetallic oxides served as efficient heterogeneous catalyst for AODS [9,10]. However, Co was mainly reported as the promotor of polyoxometallates and metal oxides, single Co species has not been reported as efficient catalyst for AODS in the literatures, to the best of our knowledge. Herein, Co/SBA-15 catalyst was synthesized using a simple pyrolysis method with cobalt (II) acetylacetonate as precursor and SBA-15 as support. Co/SBA-15 exhibited excellent catalytic performance for AODS at ambient temperature, which was much lower than the AODS temperatures in the literatures [11]. Mild reaction temperature will lead to low energy consumption and convenience of the operation. Thus, Co/SBA-15 catalyst had potential application for the further development of AODS of diesel fuel. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials Cobalt (II) acetylacetonate was acquired from J&K Scientific Co., Ltd. Toluene was obtained from Tianjin Fuyu Fine Chemical Co., Ltd. SBA-15 was acquired from Nanjing Xianfeng Nano. Dibenzothiophene (DBT) was purchased from J&K Scientific Co., Ltd. N-octane was purchased from Chengdu Kelong Chemical Co., Ltd. Methanol was obtained from Shanghai Titan Scientific Co., Ltd. P-benzoquinone and tert‑butanol were obtained from Shanghai Mackin Biochemical Co., Ltd. Silver nitrate was obtained from Tianjin Yingda Rare Chemical Reagent Factory. Isobutyraldehyde was obtained from Shanghai Macleans Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. 2.2 Preparation of samples The synthesis process of Co/SBA-15 was shown in Fig. 1 . About 0.193 g of cobalt (II) acetylacetonate was added to a 250 mL single-necked flask. Then, 3 g of SBA-15 was dispersed with 100 mL toluene and poured into the single necked flask. The single-necked flask was placed in a 45 °C water bath with stirring for 12 h. The filtered solid was washed 3–5 times with toluene and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 24 h. The obtained solid was calcined at 550 °C for 3 h in a nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 2 °C/min. The obtained light gray solid was labeled as Co/SBA-15. The preparation method of SBA-15 without Co is similar to that of Co/SBA-15, without the addition of cobalt acetylacetonate salt. 2.3 Oxidative desulfurization DBT was dissolved in n-octane to prepare the simulated oil with a sulfur concentration of 100 ppm. Then, 10 ml of simulated oil was poured into a three-necked flask. Afterward, approximately 0.1 g of Co/SBA-15 and desired isobutyraldehyde were put into the three-necked flask. One bottle-neck was equipped with a condensing device. A balloon was placed at the other neck. The last bottle-neck was connected to an oxygen tube, and oxygen was introduced at a rate of one bubble per second. After the completion of reaction, the sulfur oxides in the liquid phase were extracted with an equal volume of methanol. The extracted simulated oil was used to analyze the concentration of the remaining DBT using the WK-2D micrometer detector. The desulfurization rate can be calculated using the following formula. D e s u l f u r i z a t i o n r a t e ( D S ) % = C 0 − C t C 0 * 100 % ( C t , C 0 ( m g L − 1 ) ) 2.4 Catalyst characterization FEI Talos-S was the detection instrument used for transmission electron microscope (TEM). The characterization instrument used for small-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) was Rigaku Ultima, and the test rate was 1°/min. The characterization instrument used for the Brunauer Emmett Teller was the Micromeritics Model ASAP 2020 instrument. The characterization instrument model used for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was Thermo Escalab 250XI (monochrome Al Ka, 150 W, 650 μm, 14.8 kV, 1.6 A). The characterization instrument used for the infrared spectra of pyridine (PE FT-IR) was Tensor 27. The data of Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FT-IR) was obtained by an infrared spectrometer (model IRA-1S WL) and the spectrum scanning range from 400 to 4000 cm−1. 3 Result and discussion Co/SBA-15 and SBA-15 were characterized by small-angle XRD, and the results were shown in Fig. 2 a. Co/SBA-15 and SBA-15 showed three diffraction peaks at 0.94°, 1.58°, and 1.8°, corresponding to the (100), (110), and (200) of SBA-15 support [12]. The ordered p6 mm hexagonal symmetry structure of SBA-15 was retained after the addition of Co species. The diffraction peak at about 0.94 ° of Co/SBA-15 was lower and broader than that of SBA-15, indicating that Co species were probably introduced into the molecular sieve structure of SBA-15 [13]. Wide-angle XRD of samples (Fig. 2b) was centered at 21.3° [14], which corresponded to amorphous SiO2. There were no particularly obvious diffraction peaks of Co metal or oxides in Co/SBA-15, indicating that these particles were uniformly dispersed on the SBA-15 support. TEM characterization was performed to investigate the dispersion of Co species inside the SBA-15 mesopores. From the TEM images of Fig. 3 , the regular arrangement of p6 mm hexagonal symmetry of mesopores SBA-15 could be clearly observed for both Co/SBA-15 and SBA-15 catalysts. No obvious aggregation of Co particles was observed on SBA-15, indicating that Co nanoparticles were well-dispersed on the support. Elemental mapping analyses (Fig. 3d–h) of Co, Si, O, and C for Co/SBA-15 indicated that Co was well-dispersed on mesopores SBA-15 support. The well dispersion of Co species may be assigned with the acetylacetone ligand interacted with the surface hydroxyl group of SBA-15 [15, 16]. In Fig. 4 a, SBA-15 and Co/SBA-15 samples exhibited IV type adsorption–desorption isotherms coupled with an H1 hysteresis loop [17], which were features well-ordered mesoporous structures of SBA-15. The surface areas of SBA-15 and Co/SBA-15 were 449.1 and 438.4 m²/g, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4b, the average pore size of the two samples was concentrated at 11 nm, indicating that the introduction of Co had minimal effect on the pore structure of SBA-15. To investigate the valence of Co on the SBA-15, the chemical states of samples were analyzed by XPS. As shown in Fig. 5 , Co 2p spectrum peaks at 783.1 and 798.9 eV were assigned with Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, respectively. In general, the peak separation of Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 was 15.5 eV, being corresponding to simultaneously co-existence of Co2+ and Co3+ [18]. The satellite peak of Co 2p3/2 at 785.9 eV also confirmed the presence of Co2+. The main peak binding energy of Co 2p3/2 was at 783.17 eV, indicating that most Co in the sample was presented in the form of Co2+ [19]. The peak position at 104.07 eV belongs to the stoichiometric SiO2 peak [20] and that of 103.37 eV belongs to nonstoichiometric SiOx silica [21]. When Co/SBA-15 was used as a catalyst, we optimized the reaction conditions. As shown in Fig. 6 a, the desulfurization rate increased with the reaction time. The desulfurization rate was approximately 100% when the reaction time was 1.5 h. Fig. 6b showed the optimization of the amount of isobutyraldehyde. With the increment in the amount of isobutyraldehyde, the desulfurization rate continuously improved. When the amount of isobutyraldehyde was 90 μL, the desulfurization rate reached 100%. Fig. 6c showed the optimization of the amount of catalyst. When the amount of catalyst was 0.05 g, the desulfurization rate reaches 99.5%. From Fig. 6d, the desulfurization rate of Co/SBA-15 was approximately 99.5%, while the desulfurization rate of SBA-15 was about 45%, indicating that the introduction of Co into SBA-15 structure played crucial role in the catalysis of AODS. Table 1 listed the comparison of different catalysts in AODS performance. For AuCu/TiO2 catalyst, the electronic structure of Au could be tuned by alloying with Cu, which is in favor of adsorption and activation of oxygen during the catalysis process [22], but under the optimal reaction conditions (120 °C, 8 h), the conversion of DBT only 98%, which performance was a little lower than Co/SBA-15 in this work. Likewise, these catalysts of C16PMo10V2(O2)2 [23], HPW@MOFs [24], (CTA)PMo4V8 [25] and [C4mim]5PMo10V2O40 [26] were novel in design and with pretty high catalytic activity, while the reaction conditions in the AODS process were much harsher than that of Co/SBA-15. In a word, Co/SBA-15 exhibited excellent AODS activity of at ambient temperature. In order to investigate the reaction mechanism, Table 2 listed the results of desulfurization performance under different conditions. When the reaction system contains Co/SBA-15 and oxygen, the addition of isobutyraldehyde obviously increased the desulfurization rate. The DBT conversion rate of SBA-15 was only about 50% without the addition of Co, indicating that Co/SBA-15 possesses high catalytic activity in AODS reaction. When both isobutyraldehyde and Co/SBA-15 were present without oxygen as the oxidant, the desulfurization rate was about 53%. Thus, we confirmed that Co/SBA-15 acted as the catalyst and isobutyraldehyde and oxygen acted as the oxidant in the AODS process. To further investigate the active sites of Co/SBA-15, pyridine-IR spectrum was used to analyze Lewis (L) and Brønsted (B) acid sites of Co/SBA-15 and SBA-15. From Fig. 7 a, the band at about 1450 cm−1 was the characteristic peak of the Lewis acid sites, and the band at about 1490 cm−1 could be attributed to Lewis and Brønsted acid sites [27]. The peak between 1600 and 1610 cm−1 belonged to Lewis acid sites [28,29]. The area of the characteristic peak represented the amount of acid. The acid amount of Lewis acid of Co/SBA-15 was greater than that of SBA-15. This result indicated that the introduction of Co species into SBA-15 made Co/SBA-15 possessed more Lewis acid, which was easily adsorbed the long electron pairs of sulfur in DBT molecules. For the S atom of aromatic thiophenes, they had stronger ability to donate electrons due to their two pairs of isolated electrons, Lewis acid sites were ideal electron acceptors, therefore, at the beginning of the ODS procedure, DBT molecules preferentially adsorbed on Lewis acid sites [30,31]. To further prove that DBT is adsorbed on the Lewis acid site, the catalyst adsorbed DBT was characterized by FT-IR spectrum (Fig. 7b), the adsorption peaks at 740 cm−1 and 1400 - 1620 cm−1 were attributed to the stretching vibration of DBT [32]. This result provided the direct evidence that DBT was adsorbed on the Lewis acid sites of Co/SBA-15. However, the active of molecular oxygen was also very important in addition to the adsorption of DBT in AODS process. The free radical quenching experiment was conducted to analyze the oxygen-active species, and the results were shown in Fig. 8 . Tert-butanol, silver nitrate, and p-benzoquinone were used as quenchers of ·OH, electron, and ·O2 − separately [33]. The addition of tert‑butanol and silver nitrate did not affect the catalytic performance of Co/SBA-15, indicating that ·OH and electron were not produced during the reaction. When p-benzoquinone was added to the reaction system, the catalytic performance of Co/SBA-15 dropped sharply, confirming that the active species ·O2 − was produced during the reaction. Moreover, we conducted a hot-filtration experiment (Fig. 8b). After 15 min of desulfurization test, Co/SBA-15 was filtered out. One group added p-benzoquinone as a quencher, and the other group did not add p-benzoquinone for comparison. There were no obvious differences in the desulfurization rate with or without the addition of quencher p-benzoquinone, and the desulfurization rate increased by approximately 10% after hot filtration because the increased desulfurization rate was the co-oxidation of isobutyraldehyde with oxygen. Based on the above results, the possible catalytic mechanism of Co/SBA-15 catalyzed DBT oxidation was speculated and shown in Fig. 9 . Isobutyraldehyde interacted with oxygen to generate acyl radicals. Acyl radicals were further oxidized to acylperoxy radicals. The interaction of acylperoxy radicals with Co/SBA-15 could produce Co-peroxy species intermediates. Then, the Co-peroxy species interacted with oxygen to produce ·O2 −. DBT was nucleophilically attacked by· O2 − to form sulfone. 4 Conclusion In summary, Co/SBA-15 was successfully prepared using ordered mesoporous SBA-15 with cobalt acetylacetonate as precursors, and Co species was introduced into the SBA-15 structure with excellent dispersion. Co/SBA-15 exhibited excellent catalytic performance for AODS, the desulfurization rate reached 99.5% at mild temperature. It was proposed Co/SBA-15 adsorbed DBT on its Lewis sites, isobutyraldehyde interacted with oxygen to generate acyl radicals, which converted DBT into polar sulfides at a low temperature.

Co species was successfully introduced into the framework without destroy the mesoporous structure of SBA-15. The reaction conditions of Co/SBA-15 for AODS were optimized, and the desulfurization rate could reach 99.5% at the mild reaction temperature of 30 °C. It was proposed that dibenzothiophene was adsorbed on the Lewis acid sites of Co/SBA-15, and then oxidized to the polar sulfone by superoxide radicals generated from the oxygen molecule.",
