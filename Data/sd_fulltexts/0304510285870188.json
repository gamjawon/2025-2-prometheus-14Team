Summary Three types of nitrosylmolybdenum complexes have been established as highly efficient precatalysts for olefin metathesis with EtAlC^ as a co- catalyst: Mo Cl2(NO)2L2, Mo\"Cl3(NO)L2 and Mo Cl(NO)(CO)2L2. Reaction with EtAlCl2 proceeds in each case on formation of an intermediate con- taining the '[Mo^HNO)]' fragment, from which the actual catalyst com- plex is subsequently generated. The latter is presumed to be a nitrido- carbenemolybdenum(IV) complex. The nitrido ligand could be estimated analytically by protolysis and ammonia determination. Furthermore, we have found the nitridomolybdenum(VI) complexes MovINCl3L2 (L = OPPh3, L2 = BU4NC1) in combination with EtAlCl; to constitute excellent metathesis catalysts themselves. The formation of the catalytically essential carbene catalyst complex involves organylation of the nitridomolybdenum intermediate by EtAlCl2, followed by a-H abstraction as confirmed by trapping of the corresponding ethylidene ligand. Thus the role of nitrosylmolybdenum complexes as precatalysts for olefin metathesis may be understood and agrees well with the general concept of structure-activity relationships for olefin metathesis complex catalysts. Introduction The vast majority of complex catalysts known today for the metathesis of olefins are of the Ziegler-Natta type and are based on tungsten, molybdenum and rhenium compounds. The more active systems, many of which had been discovered already by the late sixties or early seventies, may be classified into three groups: (a) Tungsten hexacloride based Ziegler-Natta systems and related inverse catalyst combinations containing an organotungsten compound. -Complex Catalysis XXI. For Part XX, see ref. 27 0304-5102/85/$3.30 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 54 (b) Catalyst systems involving a low-valent carbonyl complex of tungsten, molybdenum, or rhenium. (c) Catalysts with nitrosyi complexes of molybdenum (or tungsten) as the main constituent. The second decade of metathesis research was ushered in by the ingenious proposal of the carbene mechanism by Herisson and Chauvin in 1971 [1]. Later on, well-designed cross-metathesis and tracer experiments provided indirect but indisputable proof of this mechanism (refs. 2 - 4, and references therein). Substantial progress in the elucidation of the catalytic cycle came from the synthesis of the first heteroatom-free carbenetungsten complexes, such as W(0)(CHBut)(PEt3)2Cl2 [5], W^HBu^CX^Bu^Br:; [6] and related model compounds of tantalum, niobium [7] and titanium [8, 9], which induce stoichiometric as well as slow catalytic alkylidene rear- rangements under certain conditions. Recent quantum chemical [10] and thermodynamic [11] considerations have confirmed the carbene mechanism from the theoretical point of view and laid the basis for a general concept of structure-activity relationships for olefin metathesis catalysts. Nevertheless, it is a matter of fact that for nearly all homogeneous catalysts, especially those listed above under (a) to (c) which are somewhat different with respect to their composition, both the formation and the structure of the actual catalyst complexes were, and still are, obscure. We have viewed this as a challenge and have consequently taken a closer look at the highly active metathetical catalysts formed from nitrosylmolybdenum complexes. Metathetical activity of nitrosylmolybdenum complexes In 1967, Zuech reported that dinitrosyi complexes of molybdenum act as very effective precatalysts for olefin metathesis [12]. Later, Hughes inves- tigated the kinetics of this reaction more thoroughly, using the catalyst sys- tem MoCl2(NO)2L2/EtAlCl2 (L = pyridine, PPha) [13]. In order to obtain some insight into the catalyst formation process, we have compared the catalytic activity of this system with the efficiency of a series of other molybdenum compounds as precatalysts (see Table 1). The metathetical experiments were performed in chlorobenzene with EtAlCl2 as the co- catalyst and pent-2-ene as the test olefin (Mo/Al/pent-2-ene = 1:10:1000). In the case of the dinitrosyi complex Mo Cl2(NO)2(PPh3)2?the thermodynamic metathesis equilibrium [13] according to eqn. (1) was adjusted after a reac- tion time t^ of 15 min. 2 CH3-CH=CH-C2Hs <= CH3-CH=CH-CH3 + C2Hs-CH==CH-C2Hs (1) (46 mol%) (27 mol%) (27 mol%) An important result of this work is that we found that mononitrosyl- molybdenum(II) [14, 15] and mononitrosylmolybdenum(O) complexes [16] 55 TABLE 1 Metathesis activity of selected molybdenum complexes'* Molybdenum complex Oxidation number of Conversion/reaction time, t^ the central atom MoC^NO)^ 0 MoCl3(NO)L2' II (L = L' = MeCN, DMF, py, OPPha, DMSO, HMPT, Cl-; L = PPha) MoCl(NO)(CO)2L2\" 0 (L\"=PPh3,AsPh3) MoCI; V MoOCl3(OPPh3)2 V MoCl4(PPh3)2 IV MoCl2(CO)2(PPh3)2 II Mo(CO)2(MeCN)2(PPh3)2 0 Mo(CO)3(MeCN)3 0 54%/10 - 30 min 54%/1 - 5 min 54%/1 - 5 min 3%/24 h 3%/24 h 1%/1 h 2%/24 h 1%/24 h 10%/24 h a Reaction conditions: solvent, chlorobenzene; co-catalyst, EtAlCl2; test olefin, pent-2- ene; [Mo] = 10~2 mol I\"1; [Mo]/(Al]/[pent-2-ene] = 1:10:1000; catalyst ageing time t^= 1.5 h; conversion into but-2-ene and hex-3-ene. show even greater activity. Thus, with the systems MoIICl3(NO)(OPPh3)2/ EtAlCIs and Mo Cl(NO)(CO)2(PPh3)2/EtAlCl2, equilibrium conversion of pent-2-ene is already achieved within 1 min under the same reaction conditions as specified above. In fact, these mixtures are among the most active metathesis catalysts described to date. All the other NO-free chloro, oxochloro, chloro- carbonyl and carbonyl complexes in Table 1 gave only poor or even neg- ligible yields of metathesis products; hence, the nitrosylmolybdenum unit obviously plays an essential role in the formation of the actual catalyst com- plex as far as the above systems are concerned. On the other hand, it is evident that even a wide variation of the ligand L (unidentate 0-, N- or P- donor) has no serious influence on the metathetical activity of nitrosyi com- plex-based systems. Simple synthetic routes to nitrosylmolybdenum complexes Nitrosylmolybdenum complexes are not only remarkably powerful metathesis precatalysts, but are also readily accessible. The straightforward methods of preparation for Mo^L^NO)!^, Mo C\\^0)^ and Mo Cl(NO)- (00)21-12 complexes which we have developed and used successfully are de- scribed in eqns. (2) - (7). The key compounds MoC^NO) and MoCl2(NO)2 were obtained by controlled reductive nitrosylation of Mods with nitrogen monoxide. The related bis-ligand adducts are then smoothly formed upon addition of the corresponding donor ligand L [15,17]. 56 solid state Mods + 3 NO - > MoCl3(NO) + 2 NOC1 (2) 1 h/RT CICHaCHaCI Mods + 5 NO ^ ^^ ^ MoCl2(NO)2 + 3 NOC1 (3) CH-iCh MoCl3(NO) + 2 L > MoCl3(NO)L2 (4) CHzCl; MoCl2(NO)2 + 2 L > MoCl2(NO)2L;; (5) (L = MeCN, DMF, pyridine, DMSO, HMPA, OPPh3, Cl-) The mononitrosylmolybdenum(O) complexes MoCl(NO)(CO)2L2 were prepared from MO(CO)(, and nitrosyi tetrachloroaluminate followed by subsequent ligand exchange [16].

Their electronic structure and redox behaviour were thoroughly investigated by ESCA [18], ESR and polarographic measurements [19]. The use of nitrosylmolybdenum com- pounds as catalysts for the epoxidation of olefins has also been explored [20,21]. The reaction of nitrosylmolybdenum complexes with E1A1C12; formation of an intermediate containing the '[Mo Cl(NO)]' fragment The reaction of all three types of nitrosylmolybdenum complexes, i.e. Mo\"Cl3(NO)L2, Mo Cl2(NO)2L2 and Mo Cl(NO)(CO)2L2, with ethylalumi- nium dichloride proceeds with the formation of a chemically similar and rather reactive intermediate containing the '[Mo Cl(NO)]' fragment as a characteristic structural unit [22, 23]. Though we have failed to detect this species directly in the IR spectrum of the catalyst solutions, trapping exper- iments (especially with carbon monoxide) proved to be the most conclusive. Thus, if Mo^^NO)!^ and Mo Cl2(NO)2L2 complexes are brought into contact with EtAlCl2 in benzene or chlorobenzene under an atmosphere 57 of CO, the nitrosyltetracarbonylmolybdenum(O) complex [Mo (NO)- (CO)4Cl-AlCl3-Al(Et)Cl2] was identified as the main trapping product. The latter does not crystallise but is sufficiently well characterised by its typical y(NO) and v(CO) absorptions at 1760 and 2090 cirT1, in the IR spectrum of the solution as well as by its synthesis from Mo (NO)(CO)4- (AlCU) and 1 equiv of EtAlC^ in the same solvent (see Fig. 1) [23]. A useful method for the estimation of the '[Mo Cl(NO)]' content in catalyst solutions is the reaction of the primary trapping product with tri- phenylphosphine to give frans-Mo Cl(NO)(CO)2(PPh3)2 exclusively [24]. The yield determined for such combinations as MoCl3(NO)(OPPh3)2/5EtAlCl2, MoCl3(NO)(MeCN)2/5EtAlCl2, MoCl2(NO)2(EtCN)2/5EtAlCl2, etc. after direct preparation under carbon monoxide, was found to lie between 45 and 60 mol% when the products were isolated preparatively and up to 80 mol% when determined by IR spectroscopy [23]. The generation of the '[Mo Cl(NO)]' intermediate from nitrosylmolyb- denum(II) and dinitrosylmolybdenum(O) complexes with EtAlCIa could (L = 0-, N- or P-donor) 4 - aEtAlCl; CO r(NO) not detectable in the IR spectrum of the catalyst solution diphos Mo Cl(NO)(diphos)2 r(NO) 1760cm-1 r(NO) 2090 cm-' v(NO) 1548 cm- PPhi EtAlCl; [Et,NC(S)S^ Mo\"Cl(NO)(S2CNEt2)2 r(NO) 1660cm-1 [SaCNEt,]- v(NO) 1650 cm-' v(CO) 1970 cm-1 [Mo(NO)(CO)4(AlCl4)] i/(NO)1713cm-1 f(CO) 2065cm-1 Mo\"(NO)(S2CNEt,)3 r(NO) 1640 cm- Mo(CO)6 Fig. 1.

Thus, this intermediate is stabilized by tetraphenylethylenediphosphine as Mo Cl(NO)(diphos)2 and is oxidised by thiuramdisulphide on formation of the corresponding nitrosyldithiocarbamatomolybdenum(II) derivative (see Fig. 1). The mononitrosylmolybdenum(O) compound MoCl(NO)(CO)2(PPh2)2, which already contains a preformed '[Mo Cl(NO)]' unit, reacts with EtAlCl; with complex formation as indicated by a characteristic shift of the i^(NO) and v(CO) absorptions in the IR spectrum of the solution (see Fig. 2). The adduct thus formed decomposes very slowly with loss of CO causing a gradual drop in the intensity of the NO and CO bands in the spectrum. The generation of the '[Mo Cl(NO)]' intermediate in this way may be stopped by the addition of carbon monoxide. Under these circumstances, either the starting compound MoCl(NO)(CO)2(PPh3)2 is re-formed as an adduct with EtAlCl2 or, after aging for longer periods under argon, nitrosyltetracar- bonylmolybdenum(O) complex may be formed [25]. The generation of a common ^[Mo Cl(NO)]'-containing intermediate from the three types of nitrosylmolybdenum complexes through the action of EtAlCl2 proceeds via different pathways (see Fig. 3). For the nitrosyl- molybdenum(II) complex, not only does the abstraction of the ligand L occur but a two-step reduction process is also necessary.

General scheme for catalyst formation in metathesis catalysts based on nitrosyi- molybdenum complexes. Mo (Cl2(NO)2L2 precursor, abstraction of NOC1 is required, whereas with the mononitrosylmolybdenum(O) complex MoCl(NO)(CO)2L2, removal of the CO and L ligands is the sole requirement. All these various reactions are apparently accomplished by EtAlC^. The resulting '[Mo Cl(NO)]' inter- mediate is most probably coordinated by one or several equivalents of the Lewis acids, e.g. EtAlCl2 and Aids, present in the catalyst solution. Its exact structure has, however, not yet been established. The '[Mo^^NO)]' intermediate and its significance for the generation of the catalytically active complex The common '[Mo Cl(NO)]' intermediate (see Fig. 3) plays an essential role in the formation of highly active metathesis catalysts from the three types of nitrosylmolybdenum complex discussed above. This important con- clusion is based on the following experimental observations: (a) The generation of very active systems from Mo^^NO)!^, Mo Cl2- (NO)2L2 and Mo Cl(NO)(CO)2L2 complexes can only be accomplished by means of the co-catalysts RA1C12 (R = Me, Et, Ph) and R3A12C13 (R = Me, Et) which exhibit both Lewis acid and organylating/reducing prop- erties. These are the sole co-catalysts which in addition to inducing an excellent activity can bring about the formation of the 'Mo Cl(NO)]'- containing intermediate in the catalyst solutions [25]. (b) The fact that the Mo Cl(NO)(CO)2L2 complexes can be transformed into the '[Mo Cl(NO)]' intermediate by simply abstracting the ligands L and CO (a step within the capabilities of the simple Lewis acids Aids and AlBr3) might provide an explanation for the moderate metathesis activity observed with these particular systems [25]. (c) In all other cases the simple Lewis acids (A1C13, AlBra) as well as strongly organylating/reducing compounds (EtzAlCl, Et3Al) induce little or no metathetical activity and are incapable of generating the '[Mo Cl(NO)]' intermediate mentioned above [25]. 60 (d) As fas as the ligand L is concerned, a certain degree of lability (usually guaranteed by the unidentate 0-, N- and P-donors) is obviously required in order to allow its partial or even complete removal from the coordina- tion sphere of the metal during the formation of the apparently un- saturated catalyst complex. Thus nitrosylmolybdenum complexes with strongly coordinating chelate ligands such as MoCl2(NO)2L2 (L; = en, dipy), MoCl3(NO)(dipy), MoCl(NO)(salen) [15], Mo(NO):i(S2CNEt2)2, MoCl(NO)(S2CNEt2)2 and Mo(NO)(S2CNEt2)3 [26], were shown to be catalytically inactive. Without doubt the crucial proof for the direct involvement of the *[Mo Cl(NO)]'-containing complex in the catalyst generation process is the observation that the formation and stability of this intermediate may be cor- related with the initial and long-term metathetical activity of the system [27], as illustrated in Fig. 4 for MoCUNOKOPPl^/EtAlCl;. By monitoring the '[Mo Cl(NO)]' concentration after trapping with CO/PPH^, by IR spec- troscopy it may be demonstrated that the '[Mo Cl(NO)]' intermediate is thermally unstable.

(b) Metathesis activity with respect to pent-2-ene; [Mo]/[Al]/[pent-2-ene] s l:6:1000;reaction time t^ = 1 min; conversion into but-2-ene and hex-3-ene. 61 during the initial period of catalyst formation (see Fig. 4(a)) the catal- ytic activity also increases rapidly, with the metathesis equilibrium being set up within 1 min of reaction with the olefin (see Fig. 4(b)). After 24 h when the '[Mo Cl(NO)]' content falls below the detection limit, a simultaneous decrease in the conversion of pent-2-ene is also observed. How- ever, up to 6 d are required before the activity of the catalyst solution has eventually been completely exhausted. A similar relationship between the generation and decomposition of the '[Mo Cl(NO)]' intermediate and the catalyst system but, conversely, develops established for the system MoCl2(NO)2(PPh3)2/EtAlCl2. Interestingly, the latter system exhibits a noticeably longer lifetime for both the '[Mo Cl(NO)]' intermediate and the catalyst system but, conversely, develops a distinctly lower catalytic activity than the corresponding MoCl^NO)- (OPPh3)2-based catalyst mixture. These effects must be due to subtle differ- ences in the composition of the catalyst solutions and are not yet fully understood. It is, however, a common feature of both systems that the de- composition of '[Mo Cl(NO)]' as well as the de-activation of the catalyst are quite sensitive to temperature changes and can be rigorously suppressed below -20 C. The fate of the '[Mo Cl(NO)]' intermediate in the catalyst solutions. Although the '[Mo Cl(NO)]'-containing complex in the catalyst solu- tions derived from the various nitrosylmolybdenum compounds apparently has some bearing upon the metathetical activity, it merely represents an un- stable intermediate, the further conversion of which finally yields the actual catalyst complex. Clues to this important conclusion are provided by the fol- lowing observations [27]: (a) Decomposition of the '[Mo Cl(NO)]'-containing intermediate in the MoCl3(NO)(OPPh3)2/EtAlCl2/chlorobenzene system is complete within 24 h but the catalyst solution still remains active for several further days (cf. Fig. 4). (b) If the MoCl3(NO)(OPPh3)2/EtAlCl2, Mod2(NO)2(PPh3)2/EtAlCl2 and MoCl(NO)(CO)2(PPh3)2/EtAlCl2 systems are formed under conditions which allow the generation of the '[Mo Cl(NO)]' intermediate but strictly prohibit its further conversion, e.g. at 30 C, no metathetical activity whatsoever can be detected (see Table 2). In this respect, it should be added that generation of the '[Mo Cl(NO)]' intermediate was shown to proceed smoothly and without any kinetic hindrance over the whole temperature range between 25 C and 40 C. The same temperature behaviour also applies to the metathesis catalyst itself which is, however, only formed above 20 C. Once generated, subsequent cooling to 40 C does not have any impact on its activity. The experimental results obtained to date prove unequivocally that during the initial stages of catalyst formation as outlined in a general manner in Fig. 3 at least two essential prerequisites have to be satisfied: (1) The formation of a chemically similar '[Mo Cl(NO)]'-containing inter- mediate from the three different nitrosylmolybdenum complexes. 62 TABLE 2 Temperature dependence of the metathesis activity in catalyst systems based on nitrosyi- molybdenum complexes\" Ta Ti Conversion of pent-2-ene (mol%) in the presence of (c) (c) MoCl3(NO)(OPPh3)2/ MoCl(NO)(CO)2(PPh3)2/ MoCl2(NO)2(PPh3)2/ EtAlCl2 EtAlCl2 EtAlCl2 (<i.=lmin) (ti.=lmin) (fr=15min) 25 25 55 51 43 25 30 52 39 12 30t' 25 54 44 21 -30 -30 01 3 \"Reaction conditions: solvent, chlorobenzene; [Mo] = 10~2 mol I\"'; [Mo]/[Al]/[pent-2- ene] = 1:6:1000; catalyst aging time <a= 1 h; Ta= aging temperature; tr= reaction time with pent-2-ene; T). = reaction temperature; conversion into but-2-ene and hex-3-ene. hThe preformed catalyst solution was warmed up to 25 C for 10 min prior to addition of the olefin. (2) The further conversion of the thermally unstable '[Mo Cl(NO)]' inter- mediate into the actual catalyst complex. Incidentally, the outstanding metathesis activity of nitrosylmolybdenum complexes must be attributed to their being useful starting compounds for the formation of a catalytically active complex by an exceptionally smooth pathway via a common '[Mo Cl(NO)]' intermediate. Although the course of the further reaction of this intermediate has not yet been elucidated in detail, there are strong indications which suggest an intramolecular redox isomerisation into a nitridomolybdenum(VI) complex which could proceed according to eqn.

[Mo Cl(NO)-xAlCl3-yAl(Et)Cl2] > [NMo^OCl-xAlCls-yAUE^Cl;,] (8) The formation of a nitrido-type complex as a result of the decay of '[Mo Cl(NO)]' has been definitely confirmed for the system MoC^NO)- (OPPh3)2/EtAld2. Thus, we have found that the percentage of nitrogen which may be protolytically transferred into ammonia increases in propor- tion to the progressive decomposition of the '[Mo Cl(NO)]' intermediate (see Table 3) [28]. The interpretation of these results in terms of a catalytic- ally active nitridomolybdenum complex is further supported by the finding that nitridomolybdenum(VI) complexes are themselves very efficient meta- thesis precatalysts. Nitridomolybdenum(VI) complexes as novel and highly efficient precatalysts for olefin metathesis In recent years nitridomolybdenum compounds have been of increasing interest by virtue of their involvement as possible intermediates in biological 63 TABLE 3 Determination of the nitrido-type nitrogen in the catalyst system MoCl3(NO)(OPPh3)2/ EtAlCl^ (a (,.

Nitrosyl-type nitrogen does not interfere. nitrogen fixation processes [ 29]. However, no report has yet appeared con- cerning catalytic applications of this class of complexes. According to Dehnicke, the parent complex MoNCIs can be prepared by reacting Mods with chloroazide [30] or by the reaction of Mo(CO)6 with trichloronitride [31]. Another synthetic method is the reaction of molybdenum(IV) chloride complexes with trimethylsilyl azide as described by Chatt [32]. We have developed a very simple method for the preparation of MoNClaL; derivatives (L=OPPh3, L; = dipy, Bi^NCI) by using sodium azide as an easily accessible source of the nitrido ligand [33] as shown in eqns. (9) and (10).

The activity of these systems is comparable to that of the dinitrosylmolybdenum(O) com- plexes (cf. Table 1). Under the most favourable conditions, i.e. a molar ratio Mo/Al =1:12 and a catalyst aging time (3 = 15 min, the metathesis equilib- rium of pent-2-ene is already established after 5 min [33]. However, although the nitrido systems exhibit a high initial activity, they are de- activated more rapidly, namely after 24 h of aging, than metathesis catalysts based on nitrosylmolybdenum compounds. On the other hand, nitridomolybdenum catalysts exhibit a high activity even when prepared and 64 TABLE 4 Metathesis activity of nitridomolybdenum(VI) complexes8 Conversion of pent-2-ene (mol%) ^a (min) 'r (min) Molar ratio [Mo]/[Al] 15 2 1 6 29 27 15 5 1 6 41 30 15 15 1 6 45 44 15 30 1 6 53 50 15 5 1 12 51 44 15 (-40 C) 5 (-40 C) 1 12 49 0 5 1 6 29 6 5 5 1 6 29 25 15 5 1 6 30 30 90 5 1 6 18 34 5h 5 1 6 12 31 24 h 5 1 6 0 \"Reaction conditions: solvent, chlorobenzene; co-catalyst, EtAlCl^; test olefin; pent-2- ene; [Mo] = 10~2 mol P1; [Mo]/[pent-2-ene] = 1:1000; (g = catalyst aging time; t^= reaction time; conversion into but-2-ene and hex-3-ene. employed at 40 C. From this it may be concluded that if the nitrido com- plex (either as the starting compound or as an intermediate) is brought into contact with EtAlCl;, there must be a direct route to the formation of the actual catalyst complex without any significant kinetic barrier. This catalyst complex is itself most probably a nitrido complex since the nitrido ligand remains intact in the above catalyst solution. Protolysis and Kjeldahl deter- mination have shown that even after aging the catalyst for 24 h the nitrido nitrogen is still present in the system in 100% yield. Furthermore we have successfully recovered 80% of the starting compound MoNC^OPPI^); from the catalyst mixture after successive chlorination and OPPha addition [28]. The nitridomolybdenum(VI) complexes described here constitute a new type of catalyst for olefin metathesis and are the only efficient pre- catalysts reported to date in which the molybdenum in the starting com- pound exists in a high oxidation state. Generation of the catalytically essential carbenemolybdenum moiety in the metathesis catalysts MoNC^OPPl^z/EtAlC^ and MoC^NOXOPPha):;/ EtAlClz To understand the catalytic effectiveness of nitrido- and nitrosyl- molybdenum precursors, we have studied the formation of a carbene ligand which has been demonstrated as being capable of initiating and participating 65 in the catalytic cycle [1-9]. As for the nitrido complexes MoNClsL;, the reaction with the EtAlCl2 co-catalyst most likely proceeds via ethylation and subsequent a-hydrogen elimination as indicated by eqn. (11) [11, 33]: Mo^NC^Lz + (2 + x) C^HsAlCl; > (11) [Mo^I^CHC^Cl-xAUEt)^] + 2 L-AIC^ + CzHg Although the catalyst formation process has not yet been elucidated in detail, we have managed to demonstrate the presence of a carbene complex which originates from the ethyl group of the co-catalyst in the catalyst solu- tion [28]. Thus, after adding pure hex-3-ene to the system MoNC^OPPl^a/ EtAlC^ in chlorobenzene (Mo/Al/hex-3-ene = 1:12:100, t^ = 15 min, t, = 15 min) the only new olefins which could be identified by gas chromat- ography were small amounts of pent-2-ene and traces of but-2-ene. The for- mation of pent-2-ene must be due to a direct reaction between hex-3-ene and an ethylidene catalyst complex as shown in eqn. (12). L^Mo^-CHCHs + C2Hs-CH=CH-C2Hs > (12) L^Mo^-CHC^Hs + CH3-CH=CH-C2Hs Metathesis of pent-2-ene itself accounts for the small amount of but-2-ene detected. Because of the complete absence of higher olefins such as oct-4-ene and dec-5-ene, the isomerisation of hex-3-ene as a source of and olefins in the product mixture may be safely excluded. In another study, vinylisobutylether was treated with the catalyst solution under the same conditions as those for hexene. Vigorous gas evolution was observed and substantial amounts of propene were detected, the formation of the latter being attributed to the presence of an ethylidene complex according to eqn. (13). L^Mo^-CHC^ + CH2=CH-OR > I^Mo^-CI^OR) + CH2=CH-CH3 (13) Using the same type of reaction the generation of an ethylidene complex in the catalyst system MoCl3(NO)(OPPh3)2/EtAlCl2 has also been demon- strated. In addition to the two prerequisites for catalyst formation from nitrosylmolybdenum complexes already specified above, i.e. the appearance of the '[Mo Cl(NO)]' intermediate and its further conversion into a nitrido- type species, it is now possible to indicate a third crucial step which is certainly valid as well for the MoNCl3(OPPh3)2/EtAlCl2 system, viz. a carbene-producing reaction with the organylation of a largely common nitridomolybdenum(VI) precursor and subsequent a-H abstraction. General concept of structure-activity relationships in olefin metathesis catalysts The proposal for a catalytically active nitridocarbenemolybdenum(IV) complex in metathesis catalysts based on nitrosyi and nitridomolybdenum 66 compounds which has been substantiated experimentally fits nicely into the general concept of a structure-activity relationship for metathesis catalysts. The few structurally characterised carbene transition metal complexes capable of initiating metathesis-like alkylidene rearrangements together with suggestions for the most probable structure of the actual carbene catalyst complex involved are depicted in Fig. 5. In such complexes the central atom exists in a spin-paired d^type configuration and is attached to a ff-basic co- ligand (O2\" at W(IV) [34], two RCT at W(IV) [6], Nb(III) and Ta(III) [7], and two Cp~ at Ti(II) [8, 9]). The following three basic conclusions may be drawn from this stereoelectronic model with respect to the constitution of an effective metathesis catalyst [11]: (1) If it is assumed that the carbene is a neutral ligand, metallacyclobutane formation with the olefin may be regarded as an oxidative addition which essentially requires the existence of a d-electron pair at the central atom as shown in eqn. (14). X .^CH^ ,, X /Cn-J Jll/ Mil/ M - - M ' ! \\ ^ ' . X CH^ . X CH, Mil/ ^IH/. \\ .--\"VH, --K /CH2 (14) 'CH, (2) The d-electron pair at the transition metal must be accommodated in the d^y orbital so as to force both the carbene and the olefin via a d^y- 2p^-7r* overlap into the most favourable steric position for the genera- tion of the metallacyclobutane ring. As indicated in Fig. 6, the positive overlap of these three orbitals indicates that the formation of such a metallacycle is a symmetry-allowed process with no kinetic hindrance due to orbital symmetry. (3) By occupying the w-type d^ and dy^ orbitals of the central atom, the TT- basic co-ligand X not only pushes the two d-electrons into the remaining Cp^^CH,^ 101 ,o7 10' ^ \"c^ d^W^^3 O-W^ CI-M^1'^ Cp^,CH^ / ^-THS ^~ / ^ruR ^ ^-ruR - 7i A He, Cl -'\"' If ' w\" 0 WR Cp ^ ^- Cl -v 2 + R 4/flr, W (Si Wial H=TalEI,NI>iH[l Ti IHI / X IX CHR '^\"H-T^ -^'Hf^ ^^Hf .'' \\''- ^'!\"'- (:p^ \"'' Fig. 5.

This model of an effective metathesis catalyst may be further improved from the thermodynamic point of view. From the reaction diagram for the carbene complex catalyzed metathesis of ethylene (see Fig. 7), which also takes into account the two most likely, irreversible de-activation paths, namely carbene dimerisation and cyclopropanation, two further conclusions may be derived: (4) In order to obtain a sufficiently stable metathesis catalyst, the stabilities of the metal-carbene and metallacyclobutane complex, (A) and (C), must be sufficiently high to thermodynamically prevent both carbene dimer- isation (D) and cyclopropane liberation (E). reaction coordinate Fig. 7. Reaction scheme for the complex-catalysed metathesis of ethylene. 68 (5) The homolytic bond energy of the transition metal-carbon o-bond in the metallacyclobutane complex C must be large enough to enable the ener- gies of this species and of the olefin carbene complex B to become equal. This is an essential energetic requirement for maximum catalytic activity if the influences of entropy and solvation are virtually neglected. By thorough analysis of the bond energies mentioned above, we have recently estimated [11] that the minimum value for the dissociation energy of the coordinative transition metal-carbene bond must be .D(L,,M <- CH2) > 385 kJ mol~1 in order to thermodynamically suppress both carbene dimeri- sation and transfer of the carbene to the olefin. A comparatively high oxidation number for the central atom may be required to enable the forma- tion of such a stable coordinative metal-carbene linkage. With this energy value and taking into account supposition (5) above for maximum catalytic activity, the necessary bond energy of the transition metal-carbon o-bond in the metallacyclobutane complex C was calculated as ^(L^M CHz) = 196 kJ mol~1 [11]. This result is in good agreement with the average bond energies ^(W-CHa) = 198 kJ mol\"1 and ^(Mo-CHa) = 150 kJ mol\"1 determined calorimetrically for Cp2W(CH3)2 and Cp^Mo^Hs);, res- pectively [35]. Hence it may be stated positively that the carbene mechanism for olefin metathesis [1] meets all the necessary energetic requirements and is also quite plausible for thermodynamic reasons. All the structural and energetic prerequisites for an active metathesis catalyst outlined above are apparently fulfilled by spin-paired d2 carbene complexes of Mo(IV), W(IV) and Re(V) when furnished with a suitable TT- basic co-ligand. In accordance with Fig. 7, the low catalytic activity of the titanacyclobutane complex may be accounted for by its greater stability than the corresponding olefin carbene complex. Since, in general, the strength of the transition metal-carbon o-bond increases in the order 3d < 4d < 5d metal [36], the analogous zirconium and hafnium complexes may be expected to form even more stable metallacyclobutane complexes than titanium and accordingly should not exhibit any metathesis activity. On the other hand, the poor activity of the oxocarbene complex OW^C^CHCIV^)- (PEt3) [34] may be due to the exceedingly high stability of the tungsten- car bene bond. By virtue of its Tr-basic properties, the multiple-bonded co-ligand X strongly reduces the effective charge on the central atom and, incidentally, enhances the M C o-bond energy substantially. This effect should increase in the order 0 < N < C R and may be the reason why in going from tungsten to molybdenum the oxochloro complexes exhibit practically no metathesis activity (cf. Table 1) in contrast to the nitrido system. References 1 J. L. Herissonand Y. Chauvin, Makromol. Chem., 141 (1970) 161. 2 T. Katz,Adu. Organometall. Chem.. 16 (1977) 283. 69 3 R. H. Grubbs,Prog.
