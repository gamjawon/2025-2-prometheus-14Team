Graphical abstract The series of molybdenum catalysts prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of porous alumina with a different impregnation order of the NiO (PdO) and MoO3 precursors was studied in the direct conversion of ethylene to propylene. The maximum propylene yield (28 wt.%) was achieved at 70 °C MoO3/PdO/Al2O3 catalyst obtained by sequential impregnation of the palladium precursor and then the molybdenum precursor. The samples containing stable oxidized forms of palladium or bonded to the surface of the support nickel cations exhibited a high activity in ethylene conversion. It was found that palladium-containing catalysts were more selective than nickel-containing, probably due to an easier formation of reduced active molybdenum sites in the presence of palladium. Keywords Ethylene dimerization Metathesis Propylene Molybdenum 1 Introduction Currently propylene is one of the basic raw materials for the petrochemical industry. The main quantity of propylene in industry is produced as a by-product in pyrolysis and catalytic cracking processes. Most of the newly commissioned pyrolysis capacities use ethane as a raw material and are characterized by a low propylene yield. This leads to a decrease in the growth rate of propylene production compared to ethylene. Moreover, growth in demand for propylene significantly exceeds growth in demand for ethylene [1]. This situation leads to a need for the introduction of new “on-purpose” propylene production technologies, which include deep catalytic cracking, propane dehydrogenation, metathesis, etc. [2,3]. The direct conversion of ethylene to propylene is of a particular interest among such processes, since it also allows to adjust the ratio of these olefins in accordance with the requirements of the petrochemical market. The technology of direct conversion of ethylene to propylene can be carried out in two strategies, which differ in a catalyst nature and a process temperature. In the first case, propylene is formed as a result of ethylene oligomerization and subsequent cracking of obtained C4+ over the acid sites of the catalyst. The formation of propylene over these catalysts occurs at high temperatures (400−600 °C). Zeolites (HZSM-5, HZSM-22, HSSZ-13, HX, HMOR, HY, Hβ, SAPO-18, SAPO-34, SAPO-44) and mesoporous molecular sieves (Al-SBA-15, MCM-22, MCM-41) are commonly used as acid catalysts for direct conversion of ethylene to propylene [4–11]. In the second strategy, the formation of propylene occurs due to the sequential reactions of ethylene dimerization, isomerization of the obtained 1-butene to 2-butenes, and their metathesis with ethylene. In this case, each reaction is carried out over a different catalyst in a different reactor. The last two stages are sometimes combined, carried out over a mixture of a metathesis catalyst and an isomerization catalyst. Thus, the current technologies for propylene production using only ethylene as raw material are two- or three-stage processes [3,12]. For example, in the 1980s Lyondell Petrochemical Co. developed a propylene production process, in the first stage of which a part of ethylene was dimerized to 2-butene over a homogeneous nickel catalyst, which was reacted in the second stage with an ethylene residue over a WO3/SiO2 catalyst to produce propylene [3,12]. Also, ethylene-based propylene production technologies have been patented by Lummus Technology Inc., Linde and Institut Francais du Petrole. However, from the thermodynamic point of view all the required stages of the conversion of ethylene to propylene (dimerization, isomerization, metathesis) are possible at temperatures up to 200 °C [13]. Therefore, it makes sense to carry out these sequential reactions over one catalyst, characterized by the simultaneous presence of different active sites. At the same time, the main advantage of using such polyfunctional catalysts for one-stage production of propylene from ethylene will be not so much the achievement of maximum propylene yields as a significant simplification of the process technological scheme due to the use of one reactor and a significant cutting in capital and operating costs. Methods for direct conversion of ethylene to propylene with sequential placement of two or three layers of different catalysts in a single flow reactor are also proposed [12,14]. But we are concerned with performance evaluation of the approach specifically for designing a polyfunctional catalyst. The direct conversion of ethylene to propylene over polyfunctional catalysts proceeds due to the chemical composition of the catalysts, which contain the active metathesis components (MoO3, WO3, Re2O7) distributed on the surface of the oxide supports (Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2). The addition of Ni or Pd oxides to the catalyst composition as components of ethylene dimerization leads to an increase in catalyst activity [15]. Typically, these catalysts work at temperatures from 25 to 350 °C. The production of propylene from ethylene was first reported over typical metathesis catalysts, which are molybdenum or tungsten oxides supported on silica [16]. For example, the WO3/SiO2 catalyst provided a propylene content in the reaction products of 85 wt.% at ethylene conversion of 27 % (438 °C, 3.1 MPa). The study of the Mo(CO)6/Al2O3 catalyst in ethylene conversion showed that the propylene yield was 9 wt.% at 80 °C [17]. Recently, Basset et al. [18] proposed for direct conversion of ethylene to propylene the catalyst based on tungsten hydride supported on Al2O3. This system is considered as a trifunctional single-site catalyst in which the active site is forming afterwards tungsten-ethyl-ethylidene W(CH2CH3)(=CHCH3) [18–20]. The authors reported a phenomenally high propylene selectivity of 90–95 % at a maximum ethylene conversion of 40 %. Over the last decade, we have studied low-temperature rhenium-containing catalysts for direct conversion of ethylene to propylene, and it was shown that palladium significantly exceeded nickel in its activity in the ethylene oligomerization at temperatures up to 80 °C [15,21,22]. It is believed that this is due to the lower reducibility of nickel, as well as the lower ability of nickel-containing sites to form a π-complex with an ethylene molecule as compared to palladium-containing samples. Moreover, the catalyst activity is significantly affected by the support acidity. It was shown [23,24] that catalysts based on the supports with low acidity (carbon, silica, zirconia) are poor active in the ethylene oligomerization, while using the acidic supports (alumina, amorphous aluminosilicates, anion-modified alumina and titanium dioxide) increases the catalyst activity. An increase in the support acidity enhances the “component-support” interaction due to which a larger number of electron-poor Pdn+ species are formed [24,25]. These species are the active sites of ethylene oligomerization. In this case, the activity of the catalyst was significantly affected by the acidity of the support. The best process performance was achieved over catalysts based on the SO4 2−/ZrO2 support. During the first 10 min on stream ethylene conversion and propylene yield at 80 °C reached 86 and 56 wt.%, respectively. The main problem of using low-temperature catalysts for the direct conversion of ethylene to propylene is the occurring of side oligomerization reactions, which are thermodynamically favored under the temperatures below 100 °C. An increase in the process temperature can lead to the reduction of active rhenium oxides by components of the reaction medium. In the present work, the more thermally stable (not reduced at the temperatures below 100 °C) molybdenum oxide is studied as the active component for metathesis in the composition of polyfunctional catalysts for direct conversion of ethylene to propylene. The aluminum oxide has been selected as a support. Four NiO(PdO)/MoO3/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation with a different deposition order of nickel (palladium) and molybdenum precursors. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Catalyst preparation γ-Alumina obtained by calcination of pseudoboehmite at 550 °C was used as the support for the preparation of catalysts. The application of molybdenum oxide was carried out by incipient wetness impregnation of the support with a solution of molybdenum citrate complex (NH4)4[Mo4(C6H5O6)2O11], which was prepared as in [26] via dissolution of 44.8 g (0.234 mol) of citric acid and 57.92 g (0.328 mol of Mo) of ammonium heptamolybdate (NH4)6Mo7O24 (4H2O) in a small amount of distilled water, followed by the addition of more water to obtain exactly 200 mL of solution. Nickel or palladium oxides were supported by incipient wetness impregnation with Ni(NO3)2 or H2PdCl4 solutions. In this work, two series of catalysts with a different sequence of the active component precursor’s deposition were synthesized. In the NiO(PdO)/MoO3/Al2O3 (Ni(Pd)MoAl) series, molybdenum oxide was initially deposited and then nickel or palladium oxide. In the MoO3/NiO(PdO)/Al2O3 (MoNi(Pd)Al) series, the introduction of nickel (palladium) and molybdenum oxides was carried out in the opposite order. There were intermediate stages of drying at 120 °C (12 h) and calcination at 500 °C (4 h) each procedure of impregnation. The nominal content of molybdenum oxide was 7 wt.%, nickel oxide was 5 wt.% and palladium oxide was 1 wt.%. 2.2 Catalyst characterization The phase compositions of the samples were obtained by X-ray power diffraction (XRD) using Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with Cu kα radiation in the range of 5−80° with a scanning rate of 2° min−1. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were taken by JEM-2100 (JEOL) instrument at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The surface areas and pore size distributions of the samples were determined by the N2 adsorption/desorption method on ASAP 2000 (Micromeritics) analyzer according to the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) methods, respectively. Temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) measurements were carried out on AutoChem-2920 instrument (Micromeritics) in a 30 mL min−1 10 % H2/Ar gas mixture flow. The temperature was increased from 35 to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1. The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–vis DR) of the samples were registered relative to a BaSO4 standard in a range 180−900 nm using an UVV 2501 PC spectrometer (Shimadzu) with an ISR-40A diffuse reflectance attachment. The thermogravimetric (TG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) measurements of the spent catalysts were carried out on a Shimadzu DTG-60H instrument in the temperature range 20−750 °C in an air atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. 2.3 Catalytic evaluation The catalysts for the direct conversion of ethylene to propylene were tested in a fixed-bed flow reactor at 70−250 °C, atmospheric pressure and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 0.5 h−1. Before reaction, the catalysts were pretreated under a helium flow at 650 °C for 2 h. Ethylene with a purity of 99.9 wt.% was used as the feedstock. The quantitative analysis of the reaction products was carried out by online gas chromatography (GC) using a HP-1 capillary column and flame ionization detector. The ethylene conversion (X), the products selectivity (S) and the products yields (Y) were calculated based on the products composition. The carbon balance was calculated, which was about 98 % for all of the catalysts. The relative error of the catalytic tests was less than 10 % (for three measurements with a confidence coefficient 0.95). 3 Results and discussion The textural characteristics of the catalysts are presented in Table 1 . A slight decrease in the specific surface area and pore volume of the catalysts compared to the pure support occurs when active components are supported on alumina, as a result of blocking its micropores. The texture characteristics of the obtained catalysts are close: the specific surface area is from 176 to 184 m2 g−1 and the pore volume is from 0.41 to 0.45 cm3 g−1. XRD analysis of the catalysts (Fig. 1 a) shows the presence of diffraction peaks that correspond to the γ-Al2O3 phase (ICDD PDF-2 00-010-0425). There are no peaks of the crystalline phases of molybdenum oxides and aluminum molybdates in the diffraction patterns. It suggests that the molybdenum compounds are highly dispersed in the catalyst. This is due to both the small content of molybdenum oxide in the catalysts (10 wt.%) and the use of a chelating agent (citric acid) in the impregnating solution. The crystalline phases of Ni compounds are not detected in any of the samples. This may indicate their high dispersion due to interaction with the support. The tetragonal PdO phase [27,28] is detected in a MoPdAl sample obtained by sequentially impregnating the support with a palladium precursor and then a molybdenum precursor. The diffraction patterns of nickel-containing catalysts obtained before and after activation of the samples in a He flow at 650 °C are identical, because they all display only γ-Al2O3 phase peaks (not shown). Diffraction peaks of the metallic palladium phase appear in activated palladium-containing samples (Fig. 1b) [27]. In this case, the peak corresponding to the PdO phase is maintained in the XRD patterns of the MoPdAl sample. TEM micrographs of the samples are shown in Fig. 2 . From the analysis of TEM images it can be seen that the support of these catalysts consists of needle-shaped aggregates of plate TEM images of the MoPdAl and PdMoAl catalysts indicate that the impregnation order of active component precursors has a significant effect on the dispersion of palladium oxide. So, both highly dispersed particles of palladium oxide with sizes of 2−3 nm (indicated by black arrows) and agglomerates 50−70 nm in size are visible in TEM images of the MoPdAl catalyst (Fig. 2e). Fig. 2f shows a fragment of a particle having a crystal lattice with a d-spacing of 0.264 nm corresponding to (101) plane of PdO (PDF No. 43-1024). Preliminary deposition of molybdenum oxide on an alumina support leads to a decrease in the particle size of PdO. So, in the PdMoAl sample there are only highly dispersed particles, probably palladium oxide with sizes of 2−3 nm (Fig. 2h). An EDX-analysis of the studied catalysts shows a uniform distribution of molybdenum over the supports regardless of the impregnation order (Fig. 3 c, f). The analysis of X-ray maps indicates the uniform localization of palladium in the PdMoAl catalyst (Fig. 3e). The uniformity of palladium distribution on the support surface is provided by electrostatic interaction of palladium complexes [PdCl4]2− from the impregnating solution and a protonated in acidic medium support surface and subsequent exchanging ligands of palladium chloride complexes for surface hydroxyl groups of alumina during thermal treatment [29,30]. A less uniform distribution of Pd is observed for the MoPdAl catalyst, and its X-ray signal dominates in the localization of palladium oxide agglomerates (Fig. 3b). This can be explained by the peculiarities of catalyst preparation, namely, the two-stage impregnation procedure. In the process of a sample impregnation, which already contains supported palladium, with a solution of the molybdenum citrate complex (NH4)4[Mo4(C6H5O7)2O11], weakly bound forms of palladium can undergo desorption and pass into solution in the form of a palladium citrate complex. In the case of the palladium citrate complex precipitation on the surface, electrostatic interaction does not occur, therefore, large particles of palladium oxide are formed during thermal treatment. The temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) analysis was used to study the reducibility of the supported components, as well as the degree of interaction with the support. The reduction of molybdenum oxide in the nickel-containing samples occurs in two temperature ranges from 250 to 430 °C and above 650 °C (Fig. 4 ). The first peak corresponds to the reduction of Mo6+ to Mo4+ in well-dispersed octahedral Mo species. The second peak at a higher temperature is attributed to the complete reduction of Mo4+ to Mo° of polymolybdates in isolated tetrahedrally coordinated molybdenum species [31–33]. Moreover, the reduction peak of Mo6+ to Mo4+ shifts to a higher temperature (380 °C) for the MoNiAl catalyst obtained by sequential impregnation of the support with a nickel precursor and then with a molybdenum precursor, as compared to the NiMoAl catalyst (335 °C). This indicates a stronger interaction of molybdenum oxide with the support in the MoNiAl catalyst. The NiMoAl sample also exhibits an intense hydrogen consumption peak at 575 °C, corresponding to the reduction of Mo6+ to Mo4+ in polymerized molybdate species [34]. The reduction of Ni2+ in the highly dispersed nickel oxide and NiAl2O4 occurs at temperatures above 700 °C, and their peaks overlap with the reduction peak of Mo4+ to Mo° for the both nickel-containing samples. H2-TPR profile of the PdMoAl sample displays a wide hydrogen consumption peak with the diffuse maximum at ∼110 °C, which corresponds to the reduction of palladium oxide. PdO is reduced in the MoPdAl sample in a wider temperature range (35−250 °C), which can be explained by the heterogeneity of the oxidized palladium species. A negative peak around 70 °C on the TPR profile of this catalyst is attributed to the palladium hydride decomposition, the formation of which is characteristic of larger Pd particles [34]. There is no negative peak on the H2-TPR profile of the PdMoAl sample. Thus, the preliminary deposition of molybdenum in the PdMoAl catalyst favors the formation of dispersed palladium species. This is in agreement with XRD and TEM results. In addition, the PdO reduction peak in the PdMoAl catalyst shifts to a lower temperature, indicating an increase in the reducibility of PdO. A wide hydrogen consumption peak in temperature range up to 250 °C is attributed both to the reduction of palladium oxide and partial reduction of Mo6+ to Mo4+. According to reported data, the presence of palladium significantly affects the reduction of molybdenum species. It can be explained by both the activation of hydrogen on metallic palladium and the interaction of PdO with MoO3 [28,35]. Also the H2-TPR profiles of the palladium-containing catalysts display a high-temperature reduction peak of molybdenum oxides (> 700 °C). Fig. 5 shows the UV–vis diffuse reflectance (UVDR) spectra of the obtained catalysts. The spectra of all samples contain intense absorption bands at 229–231 and 290−293 nm occurring due to transfer of the charge from O2− to Mo+6 of isolated tetrahedral Mo species and Mo oligomeric octahedral Mo species, respectively [36–38]. UV-DR spectra of the nickel-containing catalysts contain a doublet with maxima at 597 and 631 nm, which are attributed to the tetrahedral Ni2+ ions in the NiAl2O4 spinel [36,39]. In addition, the spectra exhibit absorption bands at 437 and 766 nm, which are related to octahedral Ni2+ ions in the nickel oxide interacting with aluminate and molybdate anions [36,39]. The absorption bands at 464 and 495 nm are observed in UVDR spectra of the palladium-containing catalysts, which correspond to the d-d transition region of Pd2+ in PdO [40,41]. The difference in the peak position is due to both a different ligand environment and different PdO particle sizes. A systematic study of direct conversion of ethylene to propylene over molybdenum polyfunctional catalysts was performed. This process can be schematized as shown in Scheme 1 . In the first step, ethylene is dimerized to 1-butene. Then 1-butene can undergo a series of different reactions e.g. isomerization, metathesis, oligomerization. Metathesis reaction between 2-butene and ethylene produces propylene. Propylene can also be produced by metathesis between 2-butene and 1-butene. 1-Butene can also undergo selfmetathesis to produce ethylene and hexene. Isomerization of the C5 and C6 products followed by metathesis would account for the formation of olefins with 7, 8 carbon atoms. C6 and C8 hydrocarbons can also be produced by ethylene or butenes oligomerization reaction. The active sites of ethylene dimerization in polyfunctional catalysts are considered to be Men+ metal cations (Ni [42,43] or Pd [44,45]), its formation occurs in the presence of support’s acid sites. Isomerization of the obtained butene-1 into butenes-2 proceeds over the acid sites of the support [20,25]. It is widely thought that well-dispersed MoOx species are the precursors of the active sites of metathesis in molybdenum-containing catalysts [46,47]. It is assumed that metathesis proceeds through the formation of Me = CR2 carbene complex (Me = Mo, W or Re) [19,48]. Fig. 6 shows the catalytic performance of nickel-containing catalysts in the ethylene conversion process. As can be seen, NiMoAl catalyst is the most active at temperatures above 150 °C. It provides an ethylene conversion of up to 49 %. The ethylene conversion over the MoNiAl sample is 30–35 % at 150−250 °C. When a nickel precursor is supported on alumina first and then molybdenum precursor (MoNiAl catalyst), nickel is actively incorporated into the alumina structure with the formation of spinel species (NiAl2O4). The formation of a larger amount of highly dispersed nickel oxide occurred when molybdenum precursor is supported on alumina first (NiMoAl catalyst). This is in agreement with the TEM and H2-TPR data. It is known that this form of nickel is active in ethylene dimerization reactions [49,50]. In this case, molybdenum oxide can play the role of an anionic modifier for alumina. As we previously reported for borate-containing alumina, such a modification of the alumina surface inhibited the Ni incorporation into the Al2O3 structure and favored the formation of octahedral Ni2+ ions bonded with the support and active in ethylene oligomerization reactions [49,51]. This explains a higher activity of the catalysts obtained by nickel adding to molybdate-containing alumina. Both catalysts are active in the metathesis reaction and ensure the formation of propylene. The propylene yield does not exceed 16–22 % at 200 °C (Fig. 6b). The dimerization of ethylene to 1-butene is the rate determining step of the direct conversion of ethylene to propylene, while the reactions of butenes isomerization and metathesis in the system proceed much faster. The propylene selectivity values over nickel-containing catalysts are close at temperatures up to 200 °C (Table 2 ), and the propylene yield over these catalysts increases in proportion to the increase in the ethylene conversion. The NiMoAl catalyst is more active in the ethylene conversion than the MoNiAl catalyst, as discussed earlier. Therefore, the propylene yield over this catalyst is higher up to 200 °C. At the temperature of 250 °C NiMoAl is characterized by a sharp drop in propylene yield while maintaining an overall high conversion (40–41 %). At the same time, the propylene content in the product composition decreases 2−3 times compared to the product compositions at lower temperatures (Table 2). Thus, the decrease in the propylene yield is associated with the deactivation of the metathesis active sites as a result of the partial reduction of molybdenum compounds transform to inactive forms under conditions of a high reaction temperature (250 °C) and a reducing hydrocarbon medium, as well as due to blocking by oligomerization products. The deactivation rate of molybdenum metathesis sites is higher for the NiMoAl catalyst than for the MoNiAl catalyst, because according to H2-TPR data the reduction of Mo6+ to Mo4+ begins at 250 °C in the NiMoAl sample, which is 50 °C lower than in the MoNiAl sample. Therefore, a decrease in the propylene yield for the NiMoAl catalyst is observed at 250 °C, while for the MoNiAl catalyst it will occur at a higher temperature. The tests of palladium-containing catalysts in ethylene conversion after 10 min on a stream are presented in Fig. 7 . It can be seen that the MoPdAl catalyst is the most active and provides the ethylene conversion of 40 % at 70 °C, whereas the ethylene conversion does not exceed 18 % over the PdMoAl catalyst in the temperature range of 60−150 °C (Fig. 7a). It is known that cationic forms of palladium are the active sites of ethylene dimerization in palladium-containing catalysts. According to XRD data, the palladium oxide form is retained in the MoPdAl catalyst even after treatment at 650 °C in an inert medium. This is also confirmed by H2-TPR data which show that the reduction of palladium oxide in this catalyst occurs at a higher temperature. Thus, a higher activity of the MoPdAl catalyst is due to the presence of more oxidized forms of palladium. An increase in the reaction temperature to 150 °C causes a sharp decrease in the ethylene conversion over both catalysts as a result of deactivation of palladium-containing ethylene dimerization sites, while maintaining high propylene selectivity. So the rate of the first stage of the process, ethylene dimerization, decreases. The deactivation of palladium-containing catalysts at a process temperature above 100 °C occurs as a result of the reduction of PdO to Pd° by a feedstock and products under the reaction conditions. It is known that, the metallic form of palladium is inactive in the oligomerization reaction. The maximum propylene yield about 28 % is observed at 70 °C over the MoPdAl catalyst obtained by sequential impregnation of the support with solutions of palladium and then molybdenum precursors (Fig. 7b). It should be noted that the propylene selectivity over palladium-containing catalysts is higher than over nickel-containing ones at the corresponding reaction temperatures (Tables 2 and 3 ). It is widely thought that well-dispersed MoOx species are the precursors of the active sites of metathesis in molybdenum-containing catalysts [46,47,52]. The active sites themselves are the partially reduced molybdenum species; therefore, the catalytic activity is closely related to the reducibility of the samples. H2-TPR data show that the reduction of Mo6+ occurs at lower temperatures as a result of the interaction of PdO with MoO3. Thus, the higher catalytic activity in the metathesis reaction of palladium-containing samples is due to the increased reducibility of molybdenum species at low temperatures in these catalysts. The selectivity of C5+ hydrocarbons formed as by-products does not exceed 4 wt.% over both catalysts (Table 3). It is therefore possible to obtain propylene from ethylene with a selectivity of 70–78 % over the catalyst prepared by sequential impregnation of alumina with solutions of the palladium precursor and then molybdenum precursor. 4 Conclusions Ni- and Pd-containing polyfunctional catalysts based on molybdenum oxide supported on alumina were synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation with a different order of deposition of active components. The impregnation order was shown to be differently affected the catalytic properties of samples based on nickel and palladium. The most active nickel-containing samples were obtained by deposition of molybdenum on alumina and then nickel, since this impregnation order ensured the formation of active in oligomerization nickel species, namely, octahedrally coordinated Ni2+ cations bound to aluminate and molybdate anions of the support. For palladium-containing samples, it was optimal to first impregnate the support with palladium and then with the molybdenum, because in this way the palladium sites resistant to reduction under the conditions of the reaction medium were formed.

        "dc:description": "The series of molybdenum catalysts prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of porous alumina with a different impregnation order of the NiO (PdO) and MoO3 precursors was studied in the direct conversion of ethylene to propylene. The maximum propylene yield (28 wt.%) was achieved at 70 °C MoO3/PdO/Al2O3 catalyst obtained by sequential impregnation of the palladium precursor and then the molybdenum precursor. The samples containing stable oxidized forms of palladium or bonded to the surface of the support nickel cations exhibited a high activity in ethylene conversion. It was found that palladium-containing catalysts were more selective than nickel-containing, probably due to an easier formation of reduced active molybdenum sites in the presence of palladium.",
