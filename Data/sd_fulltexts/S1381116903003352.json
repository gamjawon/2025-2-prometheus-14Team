In situ, time, pressure and temperature dependent IR spectra have been collected on the Cr2+/SiO2 catalyst in CO/C2H4 atmosphere with the aim to identify of the species formed during the initiation of the ethylene polymerization step on the Phillips catalyst. IR spectroscopy, even in the time resolved mode, failed up to now in the identification of the species formed during the initiation of the ethylene polymerization step on the Cr2+/SiO2 Phillips catalyst. To overcome this problem in this investigation we have designed and performed new experiments allowing to collect IR spectra at lower T or/and in presence of a poison (CO), which are both experimental conditions where the polymerization rate is so highly depressed to hopefully allow the detection of the species formed in the initiation stage. Time, pressure and temperature dependent IR spectra collected in the 173–300K range on the Cr2+/SiO2 catalyst in CO/C2H4 atmosphere show, at the lowest temperatures, the formation of mixed Cr2+⋯(CO)(C2H4) physisorbed complexes and, upon increasing the temperature the switching on of the C2H4 polymerization. A 5–10% fraction of Cr2+ sites forming the mixed Cr2+⋯(CO)(C2H4) is sufficient to greatly inhibit the polymerization activity. This suggest that the Cr2+ sites active at 300K represent a small fraction of the total number of Cr2+ sites present on the surface of the catalyst. Keywords Phillips catalyst Time resolved FTIR In situ spectroscopy Ethylene oligomerization 1 Introduction Because of its outstanding importance in ethylene polymerization reaction, the Phillips catalyst [1] (Cr2+/SiO2) has been widely investigated in the past, among all see e.g. [2–25]. In spite of the large number of published paper, many questions are still open such as the structure of the active sites and the initiation of the ethylene polymerisation reaction. The difficulties encountered in the determination of the structure of the active sites are likely associated with the high heterogeneity of the surface structures present on the amorphous silica support. Similarly the exact determination of the structure of the species formed in the initiation step has been prevented by the high the polymerization rate (high turnover number) characterizing the active site, a fact which makes the observation of the first polymerisation products (at least under normal reaction conditions) troublesome. The heterogeneous character of the Cr2+/SiO2 catalyst can be understood if we consider in detail the most plausible mechanism of the anchoring process which involves the reaction of surface silanols (weakly acidic) with the metal oxide, with subsequent formation of grafted active species (in this case Cr2+). In fact on the surface of the amorphous silica support, numerous locations of the anchored Cr2+ ions are conceivable, which differ in the number of ligands (two oxygen atoms of the SiO− groups and a variable number of oxygen atoms of the (SiOδ−Si) bridges in adjacent position. In other words on amorphous SiO2 many type of Cr2+ structures differing in the structure of the first coordination sphere are simultaneously present. The problem associated with the presence of a distribution of sites (heterogeneity of Cr2+ centers), directly connected with the amorphous nature of silica, is difficult to be overcome. It is known however that thermal treatments at high temperature decreases the population of the grafted Cr2+ sites characterized by highest coordinative unsaturation and favors the partial penetration of the ions into the flexible framework with subsequent stabilization of more coordinated Cr species [12,25]. The study of the adsorptive properties towards CO and NO of Cr2+/SiO2 treated at different temperatures has allowed to partially enlighten on the structure of the sites and on their coordinative unsaturation [8,12–16,25,26]. Furthermore it has been reported that the samples annealed at high T in vacuo show the lowest polymerisation activity. On this basis it has been hypothesized that the sites with the lowest number of ligands in the immediate vicinity are characterized by highest turnover numbers, while the most coordinated sites are much less active or even inactive at RT [14,15,20,21,25]. Following this hypothesis, under RT reaction conditions, the sites characterized by highest turnover number (probably a small fraction) readily originates long or very long polymer chain upon ethylene contact while the remaining sites (perhaps the vast majority) remains silent. This explains why even the application of fast IR spectroscopy at RT (sequence of spectra taken at intervals of 2s) was not able to single out the true IR spectrum of the species formed during the initiation step [14,25]. In conclusion, the high polymerising rate of a small fraction of low-coordinated sites represents the major obstacle for the study of the initiation step. To overcome this problem in this investigation we have designed and performed new experiments allowing to collect IR spectra at lower T or in presence of a poison (CO), which are both experimental conditions where the polymerization rate is so highly depressed to hopefully allow the detection of the species formed in the initiation stage. 2 Experimental Cr2+/SiO2 was obtained following the procedure described elsewhere [13–15,25]. A weighted amount of SiO2 was impregnated with a water solution of chromic acid (concentration=2wt.% with respect to SiO2). After slowly drying the slurry in air at 350K, the powder obtained was than compressed into a thin pellet and transferred to an IR cell designed to allow thermal treatments of the sample either under high vacuum or in presence of gases. The steps of the standard treatment of the sample were as follows; (i) heating step under vacuum up to 973K, (ii) oxidation step in O2 atmosphere at the same temperature, (iii) reduction step in CO at 673K followed by CO removal and the same temperature, and (iv) cooling step to RT in vacuo. The reactivity of Cr2+ species has been studied by dosing probe molecules able to form adducts (such as CO) or to react (such as C2H4). Some experiments have been carried out varying the temperature in the range 100–300K as it will be carefully described further. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Interaction with CO at 100 K The IR spectra at increasing coverages of CO adsorbed at 100K on a Cr2+/SiO2 system are illustrated in Fig. 1 . The IR bands can be clearly grouped into two series, depending on the CO equilibrium pressure (P CO). The first series, dominating at low P CO, reflects a CO/Cr2+ ratio lower than 2 and is associated with the presence of several CO stretching bands of adsorbed CO molecules characterized ν(CO) frequencies higher than that of the free molecule (ν(COgas)=2143cm−1) at 2191, 2184, 2179, and 2178cm−1, which undergo a progressive intensification upon increasing P CO. These bands are present even at RT and correspond to the most stable species [14,25]. An accurate analysis of their evolution with the CO equilibrium pressure has allowed to conclude that the bands at 2179 and 2191cm−1 belongs to Cr2+⋯CO adducts formed at two distinct sites (hereafter labeled as CrA and CrB, respectively). The two sites correspond to two different coordinative situations, exhibiting CrA sites an higher coordinative unsaturation with respect to CrB sites. Upon increasing P CO a doublet at 2184–2178cm−1 becomes predominant. This doublet has been assigned to a dicarbonyl formed at CrA sites. In all cases the blue shift of the observed CO stretching bands indicates that electrostatic and σ-type overlap forces are mainly involved [25,27–29]. The second series of intense bands in the 2150–2050cm−1 interval, dominating at high P CO and corresponding to a CO/Cr2+ ratio higher than 2, is observed at T≈100K only. Their formation is accompanied by the progressive erosion of the bands formed in the first phase. This can be interpreted only by assuming that that both CrA 2+⋯CO and CrB 2+⋯CO complexes are able to bind additional CO ligands with formation of new labile Cr2+⋯(CO) n (2≤n≤4) complexes [25]. Without going into detail in the assignment of all components, we only underline that: (i) these data demonstrate that the involved CrA 2+ and CrB 2+ species are both highly coordinatively unsaturated (although at different degree); (ii) the frequency of the barycentre of this intense multiplet in the 2150–2050cm−1 interval is lower than ν(COgas). The only possible explanation of this fact is that on passing from mono and dicarbonyls to polycarbonylic species an abrupt increase of the d–p interaction is occurring, because only in this way both the downward frequency shift and the intensity increase can be understood [25,27–29]. Indeed metal carbonyls of the type M(CO) n X2 (X=Br, Cl etc.) characterized by substantial d–π back donation have bands in the same frequency range and with similar intensity pattern [25,30]. The assignment given above seems in contradiction with the high lability of the tri- and tetra-carbonyl complexes (they decomposed by simply reducing P CO at 100K). In fact, if the reduced frequency of the involved CO groups is associated (as proposed before) with an increase of d–π overlap contributions and hence with a strengthening of the Cr2+⋯CO bonds a stability enhancement is expected (while the opposite is observed). This apparent contradiction has been solved by assuming that the addition of the third and fourth CO ligand is not simply a ligand insertion in preexisting coordinative vacancies of Cr2+⋯(CO) n species but more correctly a ligand displacement reaction where the bonding of the additional CO ligands is accompanied by the simultaneous rupture of one or two weakly bonded surface ligands (presumably the bridging oxygen of the SiOδ−Si groups). In other words, the adsorption of further CO is accompanied by surface relaxation. On this basis the total enthalpy change involved in the process may be small (and hence the removal of CO can be facile) because the energy required for the creation of a vacancy at the Cr2+ centers is counterbalanced by the energy release associated with the coordination of a surface ligand [25]. In conclusion, the Cr2+ centers on silica show some mobility and, under appropriate conditions, can change their position on the surface under the influence of complexing agents (strong relaxation) and optimize their interaction with CO via d–π interaction [12,25]. 3.2 Ethylene coordination and polymerization: time resolved spectra recorded at room temperature Time resolved spectra recorded at RT after admission of 15Torr (1Torr≈133.3Pa) of ethylene (Fig. 2 ) on a model Cr2+/SiO2 sample reduced in CO following the standard procedure described before, show a doublet in the ν(CH) stretching region at 2920 and 2851cm−1 growing with time in a parallel way and at nearly constant rate. The first spectrum has been obtained immediately after admission of C2H4 and the last one has been recorded after 15min. The assignment of these spectroscopic features is straightforward as they are undoubtedly associated to the stretching modes of the CH2 groups of the living polymer chains [15,17,25]. The assignment is confirmed by the analysis of the δ(CH) bending region (small inset in Fig. 2), where the growth of the chain is evidenced by the appearance of the band at 1468cm−1. The band at 1445cm−1, whose intensity is not sensibly varying with time, is the δ(CH)2 bending mode of C2H4 coordinated to Cr2+ centers. On the other spectroscopic properties of coordinated ethylene (CH stretching modes) we shall return in the following. From Fig. 2 it is evident that no absorptions due to terminal groups (for instance CH3 groups) can be seen, even in the early stages of the polymerisation, although the corresponding modes have extinction coefficient larger than those of CH2. Analogously no absorptions associated with carbene species (which are the other precursors hypothesized so far [8]) can be observed in the series of spectra shown in Fig. 2. Parallel to the chain growth we observe, in the OH stretching region, the erosion of the 3750cm−1 band (due to free hydroxyl groups [31–33]) and the simultaneous formation of a band at 3700cm−1, due to the hydrogen bonding interaction of silanols with the polymer chain progressively covering the surface. Due to the long dimension of the polymeric chains, the presence of polymer-silanol interaction does not necessary imply that the active Cr2+ centers and the SiOH groups are in adjacent position. 3.3 Ethylene coordination and polymerization: temperature resolved spectra of adsorbed ethylene in the 100–300 K range In order to follow in greater detail the initial stages of the polymerization, we have decided to introduce ethylene (15Torr) on the sample cooled at about 100K (Fig. 3 ). Under these conditions ethylene condense on the metal part of the cell (pellet holder) and consequently no adsorption (and hence polymerisation) can occur on the sample. Under such conditions, in a temperature dependent experiment in the 100–300K range, two main thermodynamic variables plays a role: temperature (T) and pressure (P). The latter is the most important variable in the ∼100–173K range, increasing from nearly zero up to 15Torr, while it plays a negligible role in the ∼173–300K range. The first spectrum in Fig. 3 represent the catalyst at liquid nitrogen temperature before C2H4 dosage. In the ∼100–173K range, second and third spectra in Fig. 3, the ethylene progressively vaporizes and originate an equilibrium pressure of about 15Torr (see the gradual appearance of the rotovibrational spectrum of ethylene in the gas phase). Under these conditions etylene is adsorbed on both silanols (bands at 3096 and 2978cm−1 due to the ν(CH)2asym and ν(CH)2sym of ethylene and band at 3630cm−1, due to the hydrogen bonded silanol, and on Cr2+ centers (bands at 3072 and 3005cm−1). Furthermore, the temperature is so low that no polymerization can start. This means that we are here in presence only of the molecular precursors which can later originate the polymer chain. The successive increment of T (at constant P of ethylene ∼15Torr: 173–300K range) has two consequences. Firstly the SiOH⋯C2H4 hydrogen bonded species (ν(CH)2 modes at 3096 and 2978cm−1 and ν(OH) mode at 3630cm−1) gradually disappear because they are weakly adsorbed and hence they are not stable when the temperature approaches the ambient value. Secondly the bands of the Cr2+⋯C2H4 adducts (ν(CH)2 modes at 3072 and 3005cm−1) are not affected, because the complex is stable under these temperature and pressure conditions. Finally, starting from the fifth spectrum, the further T increase results in the slow and progressive start of the polymerization reaction, as demonstrated by the progressive growth of the stretching bands of the CH2 groups of the polymer chain. In conclusion, this experiment allows at the same the full detection of the molecular precursor and to slow down the reaction rate (as proposed initially). The bold spectrum in Fig. 3 represents the situation where C2H4 has formed the maximum amount of hydrogen bonded and coordinated species in absence of polymerisation. The last but one spectrum of Fig. 3 has been recovered when the sample has just reached the room temperature and after 15min of contact at the same T; is totally equivalent to the spectra reported in Fig. 2. In particular we observe: (i) ethylene in the gas phase (narrow rotovibrational modes) (ii) coordinated C2H4 (doublet at 3072 and 3005cm−1), (iii) ethylene polymer (doublet at 2920 and 2851cm−1) interacting by H-bond with silanols (band at 3630cm−1). The final curve reported in Fig. 3 has been obtained after pumping the gas phase. In this condition, all ethylene in gas phase disappear and only irreversible species are present. We can conclude that, even in the case where the chain growth is definitely lowered, infrared spectra don’t show any peculiarity that could be associated to well defined initiation species. In conclusion, this experiment although successful in showing clearly the spectroscopy of the molecular precursors, failed once again to reveal the properties of the initiation intermediates. 3.4 Ethylene coordination and polymerization: temperature resolved spectra of adsorbed ethylene in the 100–300 K recorded in presence of pre-adsorbed CO acting as polymerization inhibitor As a final tentative to slow down the reaction rate and to observe the initial stages of C2H4 polymerition reaction, we have performed the following experiment. A model Cr2+/SiO2 sample has been contacted with CO (40Torr) at 100K. In this way, we have obtained the full formation of polycarbonilic species already deeply discussed in Section 3.1 (first spectrum in Fig. 4 ). After this stage, 15Torr of ethylene has been allowed to flow in. As already illustrated before (Section 3.3), under these conditions ethylene cannot reach the sample because it is completely frozen on the metallic holder. At this point the temperature has been allowed to increase gradually and the evolution has been simultaneously followed (see Fig. 4 caption for more details). As detailed in the previous experiment, at about 173K the partial pressure of ethylene in cell has reached ∼15Torr (second spectrum in Fig. 4). After this temperature the partial pressure of ethylene remains constant and only the temperature is changing reaching 300K. A selection of spectra obtained during this experiment are reported in Fig. 4. Bold curve illustrate the formation of Cr2+⋯(CO) n polycarbonyls characterized as usual by intense and characteristic components in 2200–2000cm−1 range (see Section 3.1). Upon increase of the ethylene partial pressure, occurring just above the melting point of ethylene at 104K, we observe: (i) the formation of the characteristic bands of the SiOH⋯C2H4 hydrogen bonded adducts; (ii) depletion of the peaks of the Cr2+⋯(CO) n complexes; (iii) simultaneous formation of a new carbonyl band at 2170cm−1 due to the formation of mixed Cr2+⋯(CO)(C2H4) complexes. Further temperature increment of T causes a decrement of the band of the mixed complex (without full disappearance). As at the same time the characteristic bands in the 3100–3000cm−1 interval of the Cr2+⋯C2H4 complexes are reaching the maximum intensity. We so conclude that, in this temperature range ethylene is gradually displacing CO from mixed species. This displacement is not complete even when the temperature is gradually increased up to 300K (the peak at 2170cm−1 is remaining although with only 5–10% of the original intensity). Successive standing for a long time (30min) of the CO/C2H4 mixture at 300K leads to the slow formation of the classical polymer bands (last but one spectrum in Fig. 4). The speed of the reaction is however very slow in comparison with the previous experiment performed in absence of CO (Fig. 3). This means that CO is acting as strong poison of the polymerization activity. The polymer bands are of course not eliminated by successive pumping (last spectrum in Fig. 4). In such conditions the polymerization rate is decreased by about two order of magnitude. A more synthetic representation of a significant selection of the same data is reported in Fig. 5 . Fig. 6 reports a “temperature zoom”, between the sixth and the last but two spectra of Fig. 4, highlighting the narrow temperature range where the polymerisation process, inhibited by CO, starts. From the data reported in Figs. 4–6 new features can be observed which could not be evidenced in the usual polymerization experiments (Fig. 2, and even 3), presumably because the reduced rate allows the observation of shorter oligomeric chains. It is a matter of fact that, at the lowest reaction times the, ν(CH2) peaks of the oligomer are located at 2931 and 2860cm−1 (more evident in Fig. 6), i.e. at values distinctly different from those observed in the normal experiments (2920 and 2851cm−1, see Figs. 2 and 3). Only after prolonged contact time these new components become overshadowed by the usual bands of the long polymeric chains characteristic of the normal RT experiments. This result suggests that we are finally observing the ν(CH2) modes of the first products of the polymerization. Other noticeable features are the low intensity bands at 2907 and 2890cm−1 clearly visible in the first spectra reported in Fig. 6. For the time being we are not able to assign them unambiguously. We can only conclude that the study of the reaction in presence of a poison is promising and must further investigated. As final observation it is useful to underline that a 5–10% fraction of Cr2+ sites forming the mixed Cr2+⋯(CO)(C2H4) complexes is sufficient to greatly inhibit the polymerization activity. This suggest that the sites Cr2+ sites active at room temperature represent a small fraction of the total number of the Cr2+ sites present on the surface of the catalyst reduced in CO atmosphere, in agreement with the hypothesis that only the sites characterized by lowest coordination show catalytic activity. 4 Conclusions We have designed and performed new experiments allowing to collect in situ IR spectra during the ethylene polymerization on the Cr2+/SiO2 Phillips catalyst. We have tried to single out the first stages of the polymerization process (which usually escape to conventionally time resolved spectroscopies, owing to a to fast polymerization rate) by dosing ethylene at liquid nitrogen temperature or by introducing CO acting as a poison for the process. Under such experimental conditions the polymerization rate is depressed by about two order of magnitude and new IR features can be observed at the early contact times. The formation of mixed Cr2+⋯(CO)(C2H4) physisorbed complexes has been observed. A 5–10% fraction of Cr2+ sites forming the mixed Cr2+⋯(CO)(C2H4) is sufficient to greatly inhibit the polymerization activity. This suggest that the Cr2+ sites active at 300K represent a small fraction of the total number of Cr2+ sites present on the surface of the catalyst. References [1] J.P. Hogan, R.L. Banks, Belg.
