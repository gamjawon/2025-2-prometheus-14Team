GRUNEWALD, RUSSELL S. DRAGO*, JEFFREY L. CLARK and ANN B. LIVESEY Department of Chemistry, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 (U.SA.) (Received August 9, 1989; accepted August 17,1989) Summary A heterogeneous catalyst consisting of Rus(CO)i2 supported on pyrolyzed polyacrylonitrile (PPAN) has been employed in the reduction of CO and in the methanation of COg. This novel support was chosen because its structural characteristics could provide stronger binding sites for heavy metal clusters than the more typical inorganic oxide supports. Characteriza- tion of PPAN is studied and a pyrolysis profile which maximizes the formation of fused pyridine rings is proposed. A comparison between 2% Ru/PPAN and 2% Ru/AlgOa shows a significantly different product distribu- tion, with the former having improved selectivity for small molecular weight products. The new catalyst also shows pronounced activity in the hydrogena- tion of COg to CH4. A mechanistic study using aldehydes in addition to syngas suggests that both CO dissociation and CO insertion occur in the homologation mechanism. Introduction The unique structural and physical changes that occur during the pyrolysis of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) have been studied periodically for the last thirty years. Burlant and Parsons reported that upon thermal treatment PAN undergoes a chemical reaction leading to discoloration and the ap- pearance of an EPR signal [1]. IR studies attribute these observations to a cyclization and dehydrogenation process, as shown in Fig. 1 [2 7]. The formation of this doubly conjugated ladder structure is believed to give the material its semiconductor properties [8]. Pyrolyzed PAN (PPAN) has been used in a variety of catalytic processes including: the decomposition of nitrous oxide [9], the dehydration and dehydrogenation of alcohols [10], the isomerization and dehydrogenation of olefins [10,11] and the dehydrogena- tion of ethylbenzene [12]. Metal-doped PPAN has been studied in the *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/90/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 240 Hg Hg Hg Mg ^s^^^^ c ^ <. .- ^N ^N ^N ^N Hg HZ ^2 2 ^^'^^^ A^A^ H H H H SAA-s- A^AA Fig. 1. Proposed structural transformations of PAN during pyrolysis. oxidation of cumene and ethylbenzene (doped with Cu) [13] and the epoxidation ofethylene (doped with Ag) [14]. We report here the use of PPAN as a support for the heterogeneous catalysis of CO and COg reduction. This system is novel to study for two reasons. First, the paramagnetic and semiconductor properties, as well as the demonstrated catalytic reactivity of PPAN, may create a synergistic effect involving both the metal and the support. This is in contrast to inorganic oxides, which often merely disperse the metal [15]. Secondly, and most importantly, the condensed pyridine ring structure of PPAN may provide a stronger binding environment for low-valent metal clusters than the surface oxide and hydroxyl groups of the commonly used inorganic oxides*. One of the key disadvantages of most Fischer Tropsch systems is that although they exhibit strong activity for the conversion of CO and Hg (syngas) to hydrocarbons, they suffer from a lack of selectivity [17]. The cause of this loss of selectivity is believed to involve the migration of small metal clusters on the surface of the support, leading to the formation of large aggregates [18]. These larger clusters lead to a wide variety of products which fit a Schulz-Flory propagation model [17,19]. Since the nitrogen donors of PPAN should interact more strongly than oxide species toward metal clusters, PPAN might anchor the small clusters, inhibit the formation of large crystallites, and produce a catalyst that selectively makes small molecular weight products for long periods of time. We report the attainment of these objectives and also report mechanistic studies which suggest that aldehydes are intermediates in the formation of hydrocarbon products in CO reduction. *Recent studies suggest that a strong interaction between PPAN and metal clusters does exist. See for example [16]. 241 Finally, we demonstrate pronounced activity for the methanation ofCOg with metal/PPAN catalysts. Results and discussion Characterization ofPPAN Although the structural transformations shown in Fig. 1 can be explained through nucleophilic attack by the nitrile group followed by dehydrogenation, recent studies employing elemental analysis, FTIR, thermo- gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) show that the actual product of the pyrolysis of PAN is much more complex than simply a series of fused pyridine rings [5-7]. This is not surprising, since PAN is primarily an atactic polymer. Thus the bonding rearrangements can occur in three dimensions, giving rise to a significant amount of crosslinking. In view of the complexity of the pyrolyzed material and since there have been numerous discrepancies in the literature (vide infra) regarding the nature and preparation of various PPAN samples, it is necessary to thoroughly describe the preparation and characterization of the material we have employed in these studies to the best of our ability. Table 1 shows the elemental analysis of the PPAN samples prepared under a variety of conditions. It is evident that the pyrolyzed product is quite sensitive to oxygen incorporation. Some of the early catalytic studies used air pyrolysis and reported results similar to those of sample 3 [3,10]. We note that even in a nitrogen atmosphere, there is still about 6% oxygen in the product. There is disagreement in the literature concerning the oxygen content of samples prepared under inert atmosphere conditions. Grassie and McGuchan invoke the presence of pyridone rings to explain their observa- tions of an oxygen-containing product [4]. Coleman and Petcavich observe the presence of oxygen-containing species even when the pyrolysis is carried out under reduced pressure [5]. Rafaiko and Chung et al. however, report elemental analyses consisting of over 99% C, H and N [6,7]. All the literature studies cited used thin films of PAN weighing about 100 mg. To produce enough material for a series of catalytic experiments from the same batch it is necessary to use 5-7 g of PAN in our pyrolysis steps. This large TABLE 1 Elemental analysis results of PAN pyrolyses with various carrier gases. The non C, H, or N constituent was found to be 0.

Due to the exothermicity of the structural transformations (shown from DSC studies, vide infra), it is not advantageous to tightly pack pyrolysis tubes. When the samples are packed together, the heat generated from the first cyclization raises the temperature of the system too quickly and causes undesirable charring. Thus, the PAN powder is layered out in the horizontal pyrolysis tube. The presence of the oxygen would suggest that there is a significant amount of a pyridone type structure (as invoked in [4] and [5]) in our material; however, the IR does not support this. Figure 2a shows the complete spectrum overlay of PAN and PPAN, and Fig. 2b is an expansion (shown in absorbance mode for direct comparison to [5]) of the essential double bond region. The key features of Fig. 2a are the loss of the C^N stretch at 2240cm\"1 and the growth of broad peaks from 1600-1200 cm\"1. The peak profile in Fig. 2b is comparable to that reported for PPAN with no oxygen impurities [6, 7]. The absence of absorptions in the 1700 cm~1 region suggests that there are no pyridone moieties [5]. The oxygen present may be involved in chain-terminating hydroxyl species, since there are broad absorptions above 3200 cm~1. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calor- imetry (DSC) were carried out to further characterize the PPAN and to help determine a suitable pyrolysis procedure. Isothermal TGA studies performed at 280, 290 and 300 C show that weight loss commences after 13, 11 and lOmin, respectively, and this loss plateaus at 23, 28 and 33 wt.% respe- ctively. Temperature-programmed TGA was also studied, and the results are similar to those observed in the isothermal study. Faster heating rates result in increased weight loss. The DSC results agree very well with the TGA experiments. The onset of weight loss corresponds to a large exotherm. In isothermal studies, the sharpness of the exotherm increases with tempera- ture. The temperature-programmed DSC results are shown in Fig. 3. As before, the parameters are directly proportional to scan rate. The simultan- eous weight loss and exotherm are proposed to be due to the cyclization of the nitrile groups. The information obtained from these experiments was used to devise a pyrolysis profile which would optimize the formation of fused ring species as shown in Fig. 1. If the heating rate is too fast, the exothermicity of this process will cause a runaway reaction, leading to extensive crosslinking and the formation of a very complicated network. This is especially true in experiments which involve a large sample size. The pyrolysis procedure shown in Fig. 4 was found to yield samples which were reproducible in their color homogeneity (black), EPR signal (very intense organic radical with g = 2.00), elemental analyses and FTIR spectra. PPAN is a very complex material [7]. PAN pyrolyzed according to our method (Fig. 4) yields a reproducible material which contains a significant amount of fused pyridine ring moieties. 243 3300.0 33CO.0 2800.0 2300.0 1600.0 1300.0 800.00 WAVENUMBERS (CM-1) (a) 1900. 0 1700.0 1500.0 1300.0 1100.0 WAVCNUUBERS (CM-1) (b) Fig. 2.

CO reduction studies Ruthenium was chosen as the metal constituent, since it has been shown to be very active for both CO and COg reductions [20,21]. Initially the PPAN support was doped with RuCIs and attempts were made to reduce it to the active metal species in flowing Hg. This proved unsuccessful however, because the temperature required to fully reduce the dopant (500-600 C) 5 10 15 20 25 30 ELAPSED TIME (HOURS) Fig. 4. Temperature us. time profile for PAN pyrolysis. The steps labelled correspond to the regions where the transformations shown in Fig. 1 are proposed to occur. 245 exceeded the pyrolysis temperature of PPAN and caused further structural changes in the support. Ru3(CO)i2 was thus employed as the catalytic precursor. Recent studies have also shown that this precursor is superior to metal halide species because the carbonyl cluster leads to smaller metal crystallite sizes [22]. The supported Ru/PPAN catalyst was subjected to Ha pre-treatment at reaction conditions for several hours. During this time methane was observed as a product, due to the reduction of the carbonyl groups on the cluster. When this reaction subsided, the CO/Hg reactant stream was added and Fischer-Tropsch activity (vide infra) was im- mediately observed. It was shown in subsequent studies that the long-term activity and subsequent overall product distribution were the same whether or not the Hz pre-treatment step was done. Schultz Flory-Anderson plots [23] for representative catalytic reac- tions of both Ru/PPAN and Ru/AlgOa (prepared in the same manner) are shown in Fig. 5. The Ru/PPAN system reduces CO, producing no detectable quantities of hydrocarbons larger than 05. Oxygenates other than a trace amount of acetaldehyde, a possible intermediate (vide infra), were not detected by GC, GC-IR or GC-MS. The slope of the product lines are appreciably different, with the Ru/AlgOg having a chain propagation factor, a, of 0.44 while the Ru/PPAN has an a value of 0.33. Since experimental a values range from about 0.25-0.75, this 0.11 difference is significant. Thus the Ru/PPAN system is far more selective for smaller hydrocarbon products. The absence of products larger than 65 suggests that the PPAN support inhibits the formation of large metal aggregates and/or it is a reactive support playing a role in chain termination. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has shown that there is no significant change on the surface of the PPAN catalyst after a catalytic run. This novel product distribution is maintained with a given catalyst for up to six weeks. Furthermore, the c '^- 0.0 - 0 -0.5 - 0 a-- a Ru/PPAN a -0.33 -2.0 234567B9 n Fig. 5.

The catalyst can even be removed from the oven entirely and allowed to sit out in the open air. When the system is reassembled, the reactivity returns in the same manner as before. Typically, a 3:1 Hg:CO reactant flow was used. Under these conditions the majority (>80%) of the products are alkanes. However, in a 1:3 Ha:CO flow, alkenes are favored (>70% unsaturated) with no change in the selectivity. An extensive series of blank experiments was run. Unmetallated PPAN has been systematically subjected to N2, Ha, Ha + CO, and Hg + COg gas flows, and no products were observed at normal reaction temperatures (220 C) or temperatures up to 350 C. PPAN doped with RuCIs (up to 14% by weight) was similarly found to be unreactive because it is not reduced at temperatures below 400 C. COy reduction studies We have also examined the hydrogenation of COg with these Ru/PPAN systems. Using a stoichiometric ratio of COg and Ha at 220 C and 1 atm pressure, the Ru/PPAN system exhibits 8% conversion (mol CH4 per mol COg x 100%). From the parameters of our experiment, 0.5 g catalyst and 2mlmin-l COg, this corresponds to 2.3 X 10~3 turnovers per second. This value is higher than reported CO hydrogenation systems [24]. Methane is the only product, unless the reaction is carried out in a large excess of COg (COa:H2 ratio> 20:1). Under these conditions, small amounts of ethane and propane are also observed. Since the reduction of COg is believed to go through a carbide intermediate [21], it was hoped that the surface C or C HB (re < 3) fragments could be intercepted by another species to give rise to products more desirable than methane. The first experiment was to add in a small amount of CO into the COa:H2 feed of a running methanation system. Since CO can insert into metal carbon fragments while COg cannot, it was thought that this procedure could lead to selective production of higher hydrocarbon products. Experiments revealed that with a 1:10 ratio of CO/COg, more than 20% of the methane that was being produced before the addition of the CO co-feed was subsequently converted to mainly Ca and Cy hydrocarbons. The amount of CH4 being produced at this point was only slightly greater than that produced from CO reduction. We are currently doing labeling studies to prove that one of the carbons in these higher order products originates from COa. The second experiment to intercept the surface carbide fragment involved using HC1 gas in the reactant stream in the hope of forming alkyi chlorides. Analogous to the previous experiment, HC1 was added to a running methanation system. Samples taken within 10 min of the addition showed a reduction in CH4 production and the growth of a small amount of CHgCl. The formation of CHaCI reached a maximum within an hour, at which time the overall activity of the system was greatly decreased. After two hours of HC1 flow, activity virtually ceased. Some methanation activity was restored when the HC1 flow was stopped, but after three cycles of co-feed flow, the catalyst 247 was inactive. It is felt that the HC1 reacts with the metal to form inactive Ru-chloro species. Mechanistic Studies As was mentioned above, the only oxygenated product detected in the hydrogenation of CO was a trace amount of acetaldehyde. In order to investigate if this was a side product or an intermediate in the formation of higher hydrocarbon products, acetaldehyde was added to the reactant feed. The effect of this addition was dramatic. Figure 6 shows the product distribution of a typical system before and after CH^CCOH treatment. It is evident that while the shape of the product distribution profile is similar, the activity for all products is greatly amplified. This is especially true in the 03-65 range. To further investigate the reactivity of aldehydes, analogous experiments were done with propanal. The results were virtually identical. Overall activity increased nearly five-fold, while product distribution stayed the same (small amounts of Ce and trace quantities of 67 were detected with the propanal co-feed). The enhancement of Fischer-Tropsch products via the addition of co-feeds to syngas has been shown in a number of studies. The use of ethylene as an initiator to the formation of higher products is well documented [25]. Mechanistic studies that have been done using diazometh- ane (CHgNg) and HCN have shown these species can lead to Fischer- Tropsch type products [26,27]. The interesting aspect of the present work is that a knowledge of the role of adsorbed aldehyde species may lead to an understanding of the fundamental steps of the reaction. Through the years, a great deal of work has been done to elucidate the basic propagation steps. Fischer and Tropsch originally proposed in 1926 that chain growth proceeded via the 'polymerization ofmethylene groups' on the surface of the metal [28]. This mechanism has recently received much support in studies which suggest that CO dissociation is the first step, followed by stepwise hydro- 2345 CARBON NUMBER Fig. 6. Effect of acetaldehyde addition to Hg/CO flow. In addition to the alkane and alkene products, small amounts of propanal were also detected. 248 genation of the surface carbon fragments [29]. In light of this work, CO dissociation is now the generally accepted model for heterogeneous Fischer- Tropsch reactivity. There is an alternative mechanism though, which maintains that CO insertion into metal-alkyi fragments is the major chain growth process [30]. The well-documented phenomenon ofcarbonyl insertion into metal-alkyi ligands in homogeneous organometallic systems lends support for this mechanism. Since an adsorbed aldehyde species contains both a C C fragment and a C 0 fragment, monitoring its fate in the formation of products can help to determine if the latter mechanism contributes to the formation of products. Table 2 describes the experiments that were done to elucidate the effect of carrier gas cycling on aldehyde activity. It is shown that with a N3 carrier feed, both acetaldehyde and propanal are almost completely adsorbed by the system. When the gas flow is switched to Ha, it is observed that the majority of the aldehydes remain adsorbed, although there is a small amount of hydrocarbon production. The absence of any oxygenates is in contrast to a recent study using a Cu/SiOg system in which hydrogenation to alcohols was TABLE 2 Effect of carrier gas cycling on aldehyde activity Gas flow Relative % Ct^CWH Other Moles of in products after 1 h products other products N2 2.1 none H^ 0 Ci 8.0 x10-8 Cz 6.1 x 10~9 C, 1.0 xl0-9 Kg + COa 0 Ci 1.7xl0~7 Hz+CO 50.7 Ci-Cs see Fig. 6 Gas flow Relative % propanal other Moles of in products after 1 h products other products pre-gas 100' N2 6.7 none H^ 1.2 Ci l.OxlO'7 C2 1.1 x l0~8 Ca 3.0 xl0-9 C< 1.5 x 10~9 Hg+CO 55.0 Ci 4.1x 10-7 C2 1.8 x 10~8 Ca 1.6 x 10~8 C, 1.4 x 10~8 CB 7.0 x 10~9 \" The 100% for the pre-gas is the total initial amount of aldehyde measured before the reactant stream enters the reactor. 249 observed under these conditions [31]. It is not until CO is added to this feed that a significant amount of aldehyde is noticed in the product stream. Concomitant with the reappearance of the aldehyde is the great enhance- ment of hydrocarbon products (compared to a system in the absence of aldehyde addition). Attempts were made to follow the adsorption/desorption processes with diffuse reflectance IR, but the results were inconclusive. PPAN materials are inh'erently difficult to resolve in the IR due to their intense black color. This, coupled with the fact that there are several broad absorptions present in the region where the adsorbate peaks would be located, precluded any type of direct spectroscopic investigation. Figure 7 outlines our proposed mechanism to explain both the depend- ence of the adsorption/desorption of aldehydes on the carrier gas employed and the dramatic enhancement of hydrocarbon products observed when aldehydes are added. After the adsorption of the aldehyde, the C 0 bond dissociates in a manner analogous to carbon monoxide dissociation and the C C bond also dissociates. A recent study of adsorbed acetaldehyde on single crystal Ru invoked a similar dissociation sequence [32]. Once the system is at this point, it can go two different ways to yield products. In Step 1, CO can insert to produce an acetyl fragment which can eventually desorb as an aldehyde. Recent studies have invoked such a step as a chain growth process [33]. In Step 2, the surface-adsorbed carbon species can be hydro- genated and the linking of methylene fragments can occur to give rise to the hydrocarbon products. Step 1 thus accounts for the reformation and sub- sequent desorption of aldehydes when CO is added, and Step 2 accounts for CH3C(0)H (g) I CH3C(0)H (a) 1 H,C C 0 H Step 1 Step 2 H-C H,C CHi C 3C(0)H Cg) Hydrocarbons Fig. 7. Proposed mechanisms for the product enhancement effect of aldehyde addition and the dependence on carrier gas. Propanal is viewed to be analogous to this scheme. Initial aldehyde adsorption is most likely via the oxygen. All steps are considered reversible. 250 the increased product formation since two active surface hydrocarbon moieties are present. The unique aspect of the mechanism suggested by our results is that it comprises the key features of both the major mechanisms that have been proposed for the Fischer-Tropsch reaction. Both CO dissociation into C and 0 surface species and CO insertion into surface hydrocarbon fragments are involved. About 50% of the aldehyde is reformed when CO is added via Step 1, and the rest of the bound aldehyde is converted to hydrocarbon products via Step 2. This result suggests that there is equal probability between the linking of methylene fragments and the insertion of CO into metal- hydrocarbon fragments. The observation of propanal in the products from acetaldehyde addition indicates that both of these processes can occur simultaneously. The futility of a labelling experiment is also demonstrated in Fig. 7, where CO scrambling mechanisms abound. One other observation that can be made from the data presented in Table 2 is that the hydrogenation of COg to CH4 occurs independently of the adsorption of aldehyde. When a system which has adsorbed the aldehyde present is subjected to a Ha + COg flow, hydrogenation occurs in the same manner that it does in the absence of aldehyde. COg does not bring about the regeneration of the aldehyde, nor are any products other than those from COz reduction seen. This is consistent with the fact that COg does not undergo insertion reactions in Fischer-Tropsch systems. Experimental Materials Polyacrylonitrile was reagent grade, purchased from both Aldrich and Polysciences, and used without further purification. Additional samples were obtained by polymerizing acrylonitrile (reagent grade from Aldrich and used without further purification) according to literature methods [3]. No major differences were observed between any of the above samples. RuaCCOig (Strem) and RuCIs (Alfa) were used as received and stored in an evacuated desiccator. CO and COa (Matheson) were 99.5% and 99.99% minimum purity respectively. Hg was 99.9% minimum purity (Liquid Air Corp.). All reactant gases were monitored by TCD gas chromatography (Varian 3700 GC with a 1/8 in x 6 ft Porpak Q column) and no significant impurities were detected. Acetaldehyde, propanal (both from Fisher) and n-hexane (Aldrich) were reagent grade and dried over 4 A molecular sieves before use. Preparation of catalysts Pyrolyses were carried out in a horizontal tube furnace with the tempera- ture monitored by an Omega CN-2000 programmable oven controller. Typically, 5-7 g of PAN were pyrolyzed in a flowing N3 atmosphere. The Ru/PPAN catalysts were prepared by refluxing 0.05 g Rus(CO)i2 with 2.45 g PPAN in 60 ml of n-hexane for 16 h. The hexane was then driven off in flowing N3 and 251 the resulting black powder dried under vacuum at 60 C for several hours. The presence of the carbonyl cluster on the support was verified by diffuse reflectance IR spectroscopy (Nicolet 5DXB FTIR fitted with a Bames Analytical Diffuse Reflectance unit). The spectra were quite similar to reported systems employing inorganic oxides [35]. Catalytic Experiments Catalytic reactions were carried out in a differential flow reactor which is described in detail elsewhere [36]. Typical conditions for reaction were 220 C, 1 atm, 3:1 Ha:CO (or COg) with total flow rate at 4 ml min\"1. Addition of acetaldehyde and propanal was conducted by saturating a pre-reactor bubbler with 3 ml of the substrate and allowing the vapors to be carried over by the reactant stream. The quantity of the aldehyde going into the reactor was monitored chromatographically through a pre-gas septum. The product strem was routinely monitored by gas chromatography using a Perkin Elmer 900 gas chromatograph with a 1/8 in x 2 m Chromosorb 102 column. The output was quantified by a Hewlett Packard 3390A Integrator/Recorder. Further characterization was afforded through the use of GC-IR and GC-MS techniques. The former was accomplished by a Hewlett Packard 5890A gas chromatograph using a 0.53 mm x 30 m DB130 column in con- junction with the FTIR mentioned above. The latter technique was performed on a Varian 3400 gas chromatograph (0.32 mm x 15 m SPB1 column) at- tached to a Finnegan 700 ion trap mass spectrometer. Thermal Analysis The differential scanning calorimetry was performed on a Perkin Elmer model 2C DSC equipped with a model 3600 data station. The thermogravi- metric analysis was conducted on a Du Pont 9900 Thermal Analyzer. Elemental Analysis Carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen analyses were performed by the Univer- sity of Florida Microanalytical Laboratory. Oxygen analysis was performed by Desert Analytics, Organic Microanalysis Company of Tuscon, Arizona. Conclusions The preparation, characterization and reactivity of a novel support system for the heterogeneous reduction of CO and COa have been presented. Comparisons have been made to literature studies of PPAN and some differences due to sample size have been pointed out. We have demonstrated that the PPAN support offers important selectivity advantages over the common oxide supports. From an activity standpoint, our conversion rate of 2-3% (total moles of all products per mol CO x 100%) is about an order of magnitude below conventional systems. However, typical silica or alumina catalysts have surface areas of several hundred n^g\"1, while our PPAN 252 systems have a surface area of only 5-8 m2 g~1. An increase in the surface area of the support should improve our catalyst, for surface area is often directly related to activity [34]. We are currently incorporating components such as sucrose and inorganic salts in the pyrolysis step to increase the surface area. Mechanistic studies have shown that the CO reduction reaction proceeds primarily through C 0 dissociation followed by a linking of methylene fragments. Upon the addition of aldehydes however, the mechan- ism for chain growth appears to be equally divided between the above steps and CO insertion.

Grunewald Russell S. Drago 1 Jeffrey L. Clark Ann B. Livesey Department of Chemistry, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 U.S.A. 1 Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. A heterogeneous catalyst consisting of Ru3(CCO)12 supported on pyrolyzed polyacrylonitrile (PPAN) has been employed in the reduction of CO and in the methanation of CO2. This novel support was chosen because its structural characteristics could provide stronger binding sites for heavy metal clusters than the more typical inorganic oxide supports. Characterization of PPAN is studied and a pyrolysis profile which maximizes the formation of fused pyridine rings is proposed. A comparison between 2% Ru/PPAN and 2% Ru/Al2O3 shows a significantly different product distribution, with the former having improved selectivity for small molecular weight products. The new catalyst also shows pronounced activity in the hydrogenation of CO2 to CH4. A mechanistic study using aldehydes in addition to syngas suggests that both CO dissociation and CO insertion occur in the homologation mechanism. References 1 W.J. Burlant J.L. Parsons J. Polym.
