Gadgil, S.K. Kulshreshtha Chemistry Division, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Bombay-400 085, India Received 5 November 1993; revised 15 July 1994; accepted 7 October 1994 JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR CATALYSIS A: CHEMICAL Based on 5'Fe Msbauer effect and powder X-ray diffraction measurements it is shown that amorphous FeSb04 prepared by coprecipitation method, transforms to crystalline form at =1125 K and during hydrogen reduction it decomposes to individual oxides like Fe304 and Sb203. On palladium impregnation, the reduction rate of FeSb04 is enhanced due to spillover of activated hydrogen from Pd centres to support oxide. From the comparative study of the catalytic behaviour of a-FeA, a-Sb204 and FeSb04 for CO oxidation, it is observed that there are no synergistic effects between Fe\" and Sb\" ions. Pd impregnation facilitates CO oxidation and it occurs through lattice oxygen incorporation. Disproportionation of CO over finer particles of Pd supported over the surface of FeSb04, has been observed in the temperature region 325-375 K. Keywords: Antimony; Carbon monoxide; Iron; Msbauer effect; Oxidation; XRD 1. Introduction Iron antimonate, FeSb04, has been found to be an active and selective catalyst for allylic oxidation and ammoxidation of olefins and its physicochemical characteristics have been investigated by many authors [ 1-6] . The Sb/Fe ratio used for the preparation of catalyst, has profound effect on the activity and selectivity for the product formation. Whereas the excess antimony oxide, if present along with FeSb04 is selective for partial oxidation, the presence of a-Fe203 phase leads to complete oxidation and thus loses its selectivity. Various suggestions [ 7-15 ] have been given to explain this increase in selectivity of FeSb04 catalyst having excess antimony oxide. The most accepted explanation is the surface alteration of the catalyst sample due to higher volatility of * Corresponding author. 1381-1169/95/$09.50 1995 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved SSDI1381-1169(94)00027-t excess antimony oxide. Catalytic properties of this system are found to depend on the method of preparation. The coprecipitation method gives the most homogeneous mixture and allows FeSb04 formation at relatively lower temperatures. However, even for stoichiometric ratio of Sb/Fe=1.0, the formation of a-Fe203 along with FeSb04has been reported [ 15,17-20] and the reasons for its formation are not well understood. The two most probable explanations proposed for the formation of a-Fe203are the selective evaporation of antimony oxide during calcination process and the formation of an antimony rich rutile phase having general formula (Fel-,Sb,)Sb04. The Sb/Fe ratio greater than one, has been found to be responsible for the formation of small amount of Fe 2+ specie [6,13-16] which is proposed to be the active phase for the selective oxidation of olefins. Sala and Trifiro [ 8 ] proposed Fe2Sb207 or FeSb206 as the selective phase. The reasons for 212 M.M. Gadgil, S.K. Kulshreshtha/Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 95 (1995) 211-222 the formation of ferrous species as well as the nature of the compound it forms with antimony oxide, is not well understood. The role played by individual cations of FeSb04, during catalytic oxidation of olefins is also not well understood. According to Straguzzi et al. [ 12] Fe 3+ ion gives its bonded oxygen to the olefin and gets reduced which is reoxidised by the neighbouring Sb5 + ion. The reduced antimony ions take up oxygen from reactants and thus functions as an oxygen carrier. In the present communication we report the calcination and hydrogen reduction behaviour of FeSb04with and without Pd metal impregnation to see the role of spillover of activated gases from metal centres to support oxide and the reduction pathway of FeSb04. The CO oxidation activity of these catalyst samples and the constituent oxides (a-Fe203 and a-Sb204) are also reported to show that no synergistic effects have been observed for the mixed oxide system. The influence of noble metal impregnation on the CO oxidation activity of FeSb04is also reported. 2. Experimental The mixed hydroxide of iron and antimony was prepared by reverse coprecipitation method from the respective chloride solutions of Fe(III) and Sb (V) taken in equimolar ratio using ammonium hydroxide. The coprecipitate was filtered, washed thoroughly with water and dried in oven at 395 K for 12 h. The chemical analysis of the bulk samples was carried out to determine Fe contents. The oven dried sample was used for calcination study. Small portions of this sample were calcined at various temperatures from 775 K to 1375 K for 8 h duration. The product formation and the changes in crystallinity were monitored by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and 5' Fe Msbauer techniques. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded using monochromatised Cu-K,,, radiation. The source used for Msbauer study was 57CO in Rh matrix and all isomeric shift values (8) are reported with respective to a-Fe metal. The relative composition of few representative samples was determined by EDAX using 25 keV electron to generate characteristic X-rays. The hydroxides of iron and antimony were prepared separately by precipitation from their respective chloride solutions and drying in an oven at 395 K for 12 h. The hydroxides were calcined in air at 775 K for 4 h and were found to be pure a-Fe203 and a-Sb204 from XRD analysis. The crystalline FeSb04 sample used for reduction study was obtained by heating the coprecipitate at 1125 K for 8 h and showed well defined XRD pattern characteristic of rutile phase. Palladium impregnated crystalline FeSb04 was prepared from this 1125 K heated FeSb04 sample using PdC12 solution so as to get =2% impregnation of Pd by weight. Here after this sample is referred as sample B. This impregnated palladium chloride was reduced to metallic form by heating the sample in hydrogen flow at 450 K for 2 h which is well below the reduction temperature of FeSb04. The reduction behaviour of these crystalline FeSb04 and Pd/FeSb04 samples was studied by placing them separately in two compartments of a quartz boat and simultaneously heating them in the temperature range 575 K to 875 K for 2 h each in flowing hydrogen. Every time a fresh sample of FeSb04 and Pd/FeSb04 was taken for reduction at a particular temperature. After heating, the samples were cooled to room temperature in hydrogen flow and taken out for characterisation. CO oxidation reaction was carried out on crystalline samples of FeSb04, Pd/FeSb04, a-Fe203 and a-Sb204 catalysts by placing = 0.5 g of a catalyst in a tubular stainless steel reactor of i.d. 0.4 cm, using pulse method. Two samples of Pd/ FeSb04 catalysts, used for this study, were prepared by two different methods. In the first method, the catalyst was prepared by impregnating palladium chloride on the coprecipitated amorphous mixed hydroxide of iron and antimony and subsequently heating it at 1125 K for 8 h in air which gives palladium oxide impregnated on crystalline FeSb04, here after referred as sample A. This sample and the sample B were independently loaded in the catalytic reactor and heated M.M. Gadgil, S.K.

These two methods were adopted to investigate the effect of sintering of impregnated palladium metal on its CO oxidation behaviour. One of the following three pretreatments, was given to all the catalysts before carrying out CO oxidation experiment. (i) Heating in helium at 625 K for 2 h, to remove moisture, and cooled in helium to room temperature, (ii) heating in oxygen at 625 K for 2 h followed by heating in helium at 625 K for 2 h, to oxidise the catalyst support and to remove adsorbed oxygen, and cooled in helium to room temperature, and (iii) heating in hydrogen at 525 K for 2 h to create the reduced surface of the support material, followed by heating in helium at 625 K for 2 h, to remove adsorbed hydrogen, and cooled in helium to room temperature. After this pretreatment, 100 mm3 pulses of either (CO + OZ) (1:1) mixture or only CO were injected over the catalyst surface under helium flow of =30 cm3/min at variable temperatures and the effluent gases were analysed by gas chromatographic method using Porapak Q column and thermal conductivity detector. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Calcination behaviour Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of coprecipitated mixed hydroxide sample calcined at different temperatures in air. The oven dried sample does not show any diffraction pattern suggesting the amorphous nature of the coprecipitated oxide. The sample heated at = 775 K for 8 h shows very broad lines characteristic of rutile structure indicating the formation of fine crystallites of FeSb04 in the mixed oxide. Heating at still higher temperatures leads to the improved crystallinity as can be seen from the reduced width of the XRD peaks observed for the sample heated at 1125 K for 8 h. It may be mentioned that in addition to the for- 213 FeSbO4 d-Fe703 (9) (f ) ( e) '' (d) (0 b) (s) 60 50 40 20 VALUES 30 20 Fig. 1.

To understand the origin of this aFe203, a portion of FeSb04 sample already calcined at 1375 K, was further calcined at the same temperature for another 24 h duration. The sample does not show any increase in the intensity of aFe203 peaks. This suggests that a-Fe203 is partially left out due to the selective evaporation of antimony oxide during calcination before its complete reaction with a-Fe203 to form FeSb04 and not because of its selective evaporation from the FeSb04 matrix as seen from the chemical analysis and X-ray fluorescence yield of FeSb04 samples calcined at different temperatures.

EDAX patterns of FeSbZ04 samples calcined for 8 h at (a) 775 K and (b) 1375 K recorded with 25 keV electrons used to generate characteristic X-rays. 1125 and 1375 K for a fixed duration of 8 h, was found to be 24.8, 25.3, 27.5, 27.6 and 27.3%, respectively. These values are slightly more than the theoretical value of iron contents for the stoichiometric FeSb04 ( 23.1 o ) . These results suggest that at lower temperatures of calcination there is some loss of Sb before the formation of FeSb04 at 775 K. Calcination at temperatures above 775 K did not change the iron concentration suggesting that there is no more loss of antimony oxide after the formation of FeSb04 compound. Fig. 2 ( a and b) shows the EDAX results for two representative samples of FeSb04 which have been prepared by calcining the oven dried coprecipitate at 775 and 1375 K for 8 h, respectively. From this figure it is clear that Sb/Fe ratio on the surface has significantly increased for the sample calcined at 1375 K. Further unlike chemical analysis, the EDAX analysis carried out using 25 keV electrons whose penetration is confined up to a depth of =1.8 microns, showed that the Sb/Fe ratio for the samples calcined at 775 K and 1375 K is 1.03 and 1.09, respectively, which is originating because of the selective evaporation of antimony oxide from the bulk. Based on these observations it is possible to rule out the suggestions of Centi and Trifiro [ 19 ] about the formation of a-Fe203. These authors have ruled out the possibility of selective evaporation of antimony oxide during calcination process and have suggested the formation of rutile phase with excess antimony namely (Fet_xSbx)Sb04 thereby leading to the formation of a-Fe203. However, under such situation the Sb/Fe ratio is expected to change neither in the bulk nor on the surface during calcination process. This is unlike what has been observed in the present study using both chemical analysis and EDAX measurements. Further, no change in the unit cell volume has been observed for FeSb04 samples calcined at different temperatures (1075 <_ T/K < 1375 ) which is well above the temperature of rutile phase formation, suggesting that there is no change in the composition of FeSb04 lattice above 975 K and selective evaporation of antimony oxide from FeSb04 matrix does not occur. The observed value of the unit cell volume in the present study is 66.0 is in good agreement with the value reported by Centi et al. [ 19] for their stoichiometric composition of FeSb04 calcined at 1175 K and above. The observed Sb enrichment on the surface is quite similar to what has been reported earlier from the XPS studies of Sb204 + Sn02 system [ 21 ] , where it was suggested that during calcination at 875 K, due to selective evaporation of Sb from the bulk, the surface gets enriched with antimony up to a depth of = 50 It may be mentioned that the crystallisation of a-FeZ03 is significantly retarded due to its coprecipitation with antimony oxide as seen from the XRD pattern of the sample heated at 775 K for 8 h and shown in Fig. 1(b), because the oven dried sample of iron oxide alone, when heated at = 775 K for 8 h, was found to be well crystalline.

The spectra recorded at 78 K for the samples calcined at (c) 775 K, (e) 1125 K and (g) 1375 K. shown in Fig. 3. All spectra show quadrupole doublet. The values of various Msbauer parameters obtained from the fitting of these spectra show that on increasing calcination temperature, the line width and quadrupole splitting values (dEq) are decreased. The Msbauer spectra of the samples calcined at 1125 K and above, for which the XRD patterns show good crystallinity, show a well defined quadrupole doublet with 8=0.37 mm/s and d Eq = 0.75 mm / s indicating the existence of high spin Fe\" in a distorted octahedral environment. These values are in very good agreement with those reported earlier [ 22 ] for FeSb04. This indicates that the reaction between iron oxide and antimony oxide is complete by 1125 K. The spectrum of the sample calcined at 1375 K ( Fig. 3 ( f) ) shows the presence of a magnetic sextet corresponding to a-Fe203 in addition to a quadrupole doublet of FeSb04, which is consistent with XRD results. For lower temperatures of calcination the unreacted a-Fe203 if present, is in the form of very fine particles dispersed in an amorphous matrix. These fine particles of a-Fe203, due to superparamagnetic effects, give rise to a quadrupole doublet which is superimposed over the quadrupole doublet of FeSb04 formed due to partial completion of reaction. The 5'Fe Msbauer spectra of the samples calcined at 775, 1125 and 1375 K, when recorded at 78 K, clearly showed the broadening of the central doublet and the 215 appearance of a magnetic sextet ( viz. Fig. 3 ( e and g) ) which is the characteristic feature of superparamagnetic particles. No detectable difference in the calcination behaviour of FeSb04and Pd/ FeSb04 is observed. 3.2. Reduction behaviour A representative set of XRD patterns, depicting the reduction behaviour of crystalline FeSb04 at different temperatures, is shown in Fig. 4. Since the reduction study at variable temperatures is carried out by taking every time a fresh sample of FeSb04, the relative amounts of various products as revealed by XRD patterns, are not varying quantitatively in relation with the reduction temperature.

X-ray diffraction patterns of FeSb04 samples heated in hydrogen flow for 2 h at (d) 625 K and (f) 650 K are given for comparison. FeSb04 up to a reduction temperature of 625 K, the possibility of surface reduction can not be ruled out. Fig. 4(c) shows the formation of Sb203, FeSb2 and FeSb along with minor amount of unreduced FeSb04. The FeSb04 samples reduced at higher temperatures ( at 675 K and 775 K, Fig. 4(d) and 4(e) ) show the formation of Sb203, Fe304, Sb metal and intermetallics FeSb2 and FeSb in varying amounts. Further, at reduction temperature of 825 K the main product of reduction, FeSb, is obtained ( Fig. 4 ( f) ) . It may be specifically mentioned that the crystalline FeSb04 used for the present reduction study contained detectable amount of a-Fe203 which may be expected to give the corresponding amount of Fe 30 20 metal on reduction. However, the formation of Fe metal is not clearly seen in the XRD pattern shown in Fig. 4(f) because of the two possible reasons. (i) The prominent (110) Bragg reflection of bcc Fe placed at 28=44.7is completely masked by the intense (110) Bragg reflection of FeSb placed at 244.3due to its very small abundance. The other less intense reflection of a-Fe lie at 2 0 > 60and are not seen in this figure. ( ii) The other most probable reason is the nonstoichiometric nature of FeSb phase which is known to exist as a hexagonal single phase with significantly excess concentration of Fe with an atomic ratio of 1.08 <_ Fe/ Sb < 1.38 [ 23-25 ] . Further, it has also been reported that the values of cell parameters and their ratio cla depends on the Fe/Sb ratio. The observed values of a = 4.098 and c = 5.145 in the present study are corresponding to the Fe rich compositions [ 23 ] . The formation of Sb203, at initial stages of reduction ( at 650 K) as a major product, indicates that the reduction of FeSb04 occurs by decomposition to give its individual oxides of lower oxidation state, as shown below. 6FeSb04~ 2Fe304 + 35b203 Although, at 650 K temperature of reduction, the formation of Fe304 is not clearly seen in XRD pattern possibly due to its amorphous and finely dispersed form, it can be clearly observed at high temperature of reduction. As the reduction of Sb203 to Sb metal is faster than that of Fe304 to Fe metal, the Sb metal forms in excess of Fe metal and gives rise to FeSb2. On complete reduction of these different oxide phases, the expected single product FeSb, is formed. The Fe 2+ compounds with antimony oxide, e.g. FeSb206, Fe2Sb207 and FeSb204 which are said to be active and selective phases in olefin oxidation, are not formed as bulk material during hydrogen reduction of FeSb04 possibly because of the difference in reducing power of hydrogen and olefins. The results obtained from the XRD patterns of reduced samples of FeSb04 and Pd/FeSb04 have revealed that although the reduction of FeSb04 is facilitated by Pd impregnation, the reduction pathway is the same for both the samples.

The spectra recorded at 78 K for the samples heated in hydrogen flow at (c) 650 K and (e) 675 K. reduction is initiated at = 600 K ( Fig. 5 ( b ) ) which is lower than that observed for FeSb04 (650 K) as can be seen from Fig. 5. This is due to activation and spillover of hydrogen from palladium metal sites to FeSb04 support causing its reduction at relatively lower temperature. The representative 5'Fe Msbauer spectra recorded at room temperature for the reduced samples of FeSb04are shown in Fig. 6. The results are complementary to the XRD results. Fig. 6 ( a) shows quadrupole doublet having 8=0.35 mm/s and dEq=0.75 mm/s indicating no bulk reduction of FeSb04 at 625 K. The broad unresolved two sextets expected for the fine particles of Fe304 are seen in Fig. 6 ( f ) along with the spectra of FeSb2 and FeSb products. Because of very complex nature it is not possible to fit this spectrum to evaluate the relative contribution of different phases. The formation of Fe304at lower temperature of reduction (in Fig. 6(b and d)) is not clearly seen due to the finely dispersed nature of these small particles which do not exhibit magnetic pattern. The presence of Fe304is better demonstrated from the liquid nitrogen temperature Msbauer spectra of the samples reduced at 650 and 675 K, which are shown in Fig. 6(c) and (e), respectively. Presence of FeSb2 is revealed by paramagnetic quadrupole doublet having 8=0.47 mm/s and AE, = 1.28 mm/s whereas FeSb exhibits an unresolved quadrupole doublet having 217 8=0.41 mm/s and dEq=0.285 mm/s. These parameters are in agreement with those reported for FeSbZ and FeSb in literature [ 26 ] . At the end of reduction of FeSb04 the expected product, FeSb, is formed which is shown in Fig. 6(g). The existence of free Fe metal is not seen in this figure because the FeSb formed is nonstoichiometric with atomic ratio of Fe/Sb > 1.0. 3.3. CO oxidation reaction Fig. 7 shows the plots of yield of COZ as a function of temperature when 100 mm' pulse of either CO or (CO+02) mixture is injected over the surface of crystalline FeSb04 catalyst pretreated in helium at 625 K for 2 h. It can be observed that when a pulse of ( CO + OZ) is injected over the surface of catalyst, CO oxidation initiates at = 475 K and is almost complete by = 575 K ( viz. Fig. 7 ( b ) ) .

The yield of unreacted CO corresponding to Fig. (a), (c) and (d) are shown in Fig. (a') (O), (c') ( and (d) ( ). CO pulse has been injected, the CO oxidation although complete, but occurs at relatively higher temperature (Fig. 7 ( a) ) . Further, the yield of COZ for FeSb04sample pretreated at 525 K, in HZ was found to be much lower when only CO pulses were injected. These results possibly suggest that CO oxidation occurs through lattice oxygen abstraction and oxygen present in the feed gas mixture facilitates it by surface rejuvenation. The role of lattice oxygen during CO oxidation over the surface of oxide systems has been investigated by a number of investigators [27,28] using 180 enriched reactants and it has been shown that oxygen from the surface layers is used for CO oxidation and the high mobility of lattice oxygen to surface sites facilitates this oxidation. Keulks [ 27 ] has studied the CO oxidation over the sur- face of bismuth molybdate catalyst and emphasised the role of oxygen diffused from the subsurface layers to the surface sites available on the catalyst. Conner et al. [ 28 ] have studied the oxidation of CO over Ni0 catalyst and suggested that there are two reaction mechanisms for CO oxidation to form C02, and surface oxygen is mainly reacting with CO. The oxygen pretreatment given to the catalyst at 650 K for 2 h has not shown any improvement in the catalytic activity of FeSb04 ( Fig. 7 ( c ) ) as compared to its activity before oxygen pretreatment ( Fig. 7 ( a) ) indicating that no adsorbed oxygen is left over the surface of FeSb04after pretreatment in oxygen ( 625 K, 2 h) followed by heating in flowing helium at 625 K for 2 h. Fig. 7 ( a' ) and ( c' ) show the amount of unreacted CO eluted during the COZ oxidation experiments corresponding to the results of CO yield, shown in Fig. 7 ( a) and ( c) , respectively.

On comparison of this plot with Fig. 8(b) where pulses Of (CO +Oz) mixture are injected over similarly pretreated catalyst, reveals that oxygen present in the reactant gas mixture facilitates CO oxidation. The oxygen pretreatment of Pd/FeSb04catalyst at 625 K for 2 h has enhanced the catalytic activity for CO oxidation as shown in Fig. 8(c) where only CO pulses are injected.

An analysis of the results shown in Fig. 8 ( a) and ( a' ) suggests that the total yield of COZ can not be understood in terms of the CO disproportionation alone and lattice oxygen from support oxide is being used as the Pd sites are not oxidised under the experimental conditions. On comparison of CO oxidation activity of Pd/FeSb04 and FeSb04 when only CO pulses are injected after the same pretreatment ( viz. Fig. 8 ( a) and 7 ( a) ) , it is observed that the CO oxidation activity is significantly improved due to Pd metal impregnation over the surface of FeSb04. Based on these results it can be inferred that activation of CO on palladium sites and its M.M. Gadgil, S.K Kulshreshtha /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 95 (1995) 211-222 spillover to the support takes place which enhances the CO oxidation activity due to lattice oxygen incorporation. Further a comparison of the results shown in Fig. 8 ( a and a') and 8 ( c and c') suggests that the oxygen treatment given to the catalyst has enhanced the yield of CO2. This may possibly be arising due to the availability of additional oxygen from NO, type of species produced during oxygen pretreatment given to the catalyst. The hydrogen pretreatment of Pd/FeSb04 catalyst at 525 K for 2 h has significantly lowered the CO oxidation activity ( Fig. 8 ( d ) ) . This is due to surface reduction of FeSb04and thereby affecting the availability of lattice oxygen. When pulses of (CO + OZ) mixture are injected over this reduced surface the activity of Pd/FeSb04 increased drastically (Fig. 8(e)) as a result of rejuvenation of the surface lattice oxygen of the catalyst with the help of oxygen present in reactant gas mixture. The Pd/FeSb04 catalyst prepared by another method, i.e. sample B, has behaved differently in CO oxidation experiments as compared to sample A as can be seen from the results presented in Fig. 9 ( a) and ( b ) for the same pretreatment. The yield of CO2, when only CO pulses are injected over sample B, shows a clear discontinuity in the region 325 K to 375 K in Fig. 9(a) which is absent in Fig. 9(b). This discontinuity in the yield of C02 is due to the disproportionation of CO on palladium sites to give active carbon and CO2. During this process, since two chemisorbed CO molecules are consumed to give only one molecule of CO2, the yield of COZ decreases with increasing temperature and gives rise to this discontinuity. The observed disproportionation step is further confirmed from the formation of COZ ( Fig. 9 ( c ) ) when 80 mm' pulse of oxygen is injected over the Pd/FeSb04 catalyst (sample B) after elution of bothC02and unreacted CO, at different temperatures. This COZ is formed due to the reaction between oxygen and the active carbon formed over Pd surface during CO disproportionation process. When similar experiments of oxygen injection are carried out over sample A, after CO oxidation and elution of both COZ and unreacted CO, the formation of additional COZ is not M.M. G adgil, S.K Kulshreshtha /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 95 (1995) 211-222 observed which suggests the absence of CO disproportionation step for this sample. The disproportionation of CO on palladium is reported in literature by many authors [29-32] and it has been shown that the disproportionation takes place only on smaller particles of palladium. For sample A, during calcination process the agglomerates of palladium oxide are formed over the surface of FeSb04 which on hydrogen reduction lead to the formation of much bigger clusters of Pd metal thereby preventing the CO disproportionation step. Further support to this inference is provided from the appearance of PdO peak in the XRD pattern of sample A (28=33.95 which is not observed for sample B calcined at 675 K for 4 h as can be seen from the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 10(a) and (b). This observation is in conformity with the results reported earlier [ 29-32 ] that CO disproportionation occurs only on fine particles of Pd metal. The CO oxidation activity measured in terms of the number of COZ molecules formed per unit surface area when 100 mm3 pulse of CO were injected over the surface of the crystalline samples of a-FeA, a-Sb204 and FeSb04, is shown in Fig. 11(a) , (b) and (c) , respectively. From the comparison of these plots it is observed that a-Fe203 is the most active for CO oxidation. Unlike this, a-Sb204 is the least active and complete conversion of CO could not be achieved even up to 775 K. The reducibility character of different oxides can be measured in terms of the change in free energy involved during breaking of the bond between metal and oxygen ions [ 33 ] . These values for Fe3+-O and Sbs+-O are 41.67 and 38.60 kcal/mol [34], respectively, which are almost comparable. Similarly, the reduction potential for Sbs+ -> Sb3+ (0.70 eV) is quite comparable to the value of Fe3+ -~ Fe2+ (0.77 eV) [ 35 ] . Both these observations suggest that the CO oxidation capability of both the catalysts must be similar which is unlike what has been observed in the present study. The catalytic activity of crystalline FeSb04 is less than that of a-Fe203 as seen from Fig. 11(c). Further, no synergistic effects have been observed between Sb5+ and Fe3+ ions. This is unlike what has been reported by Weng et al. 221 [ 36] for M003 + Sb204 and Sn02 + Sb204 systems where significant synergistic effects between Sn-Sb and Mo-Sb ions have been demonstrated. It may further be mentioned that the CO oxidation activity of a-Fe203 + Sn0z and MnZ03 + Sn02 systems, which do not undergo a chemical reaction to form a new phase, is found to increase significantly as compared to that of the constituents [ 37 ] . These observations suggest that the observed activity for FeSb04 is characteristic of this compound and is significantly better than that observed for a-Sb204 but less than that of aFez03, In order to further ascertain the reduction behaviour of Fe3+ and SbS+ cations, a mixture of crystalline a-Fe203 and a-Sb204 (which were precalcined individually at 775 K) and crystalline FeSb04 were treated with CO at 625 K for 2 h in continuous flow mode. The 5' Fe Msbauer spectra of the mixed oxide sample clearly showed the formation of Fe304 due to partial reduction of aFe203 by CO as can be seen from Fig. 12. The Xray diffraction studies of this CO treated mixed oxide clearly showed the formation of both Fe304 and Sb203 as can be seen from Fig. 13 (a and b) . Unlike this, the X-ray diffraction studies of the crystalline FeSb04 after treating with CO did not show any bulk transformation of the sample, viz. Fig. 13 (c) . Similarly, the room temperature 5' Fe Msbauer spectrum of crystalline FeSb04 treated with CO at 625 K for 2 h did not show the bulk reduction of the sample as can be seen from Fig. 12 (c) which is very similar to that observed for the original FeSb04 sample. However, the low temperature Mfissbauer spectra and room temperature magnetisation measurements suggest the formation of Fe304. These results provide evidence for the surface decomposition of FeSb04 and reduction of Fe3+ species during CO treatment. Further, it is of interest to note that the mechanism of initial reduction of FeSb04 during hydrogen and CO treatment is almost similar. 4. Conclusions In conclusion, in the present communication the calcination and hydrogen reduction behaviour of 222 M.M. Gadgil, S.K Kulshreshtha /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 95 (1995) 211-222 FeSb04 catalyst with and without Pd metal impregnation has been investigated and it is observed that the reduction of FeSb04 takes place by decomposition process and metal impregnation facilitates the reduction at relatively lower temperatures due to spillover of activated hydrogen from Pd centres to the support. The reasons for the formation of a-Fe203 during calcination of coprecipitated mixed oxides are discussed. The results of CO oxidation presented in this study show that lattice oxygen incorporation is an important mode of CO oxidation for FeSb04. For Pd impregnated FeSb04 the CO oxidation occurs at lower temperatures due to spillover of activated CO from metal centres to the support where it reacts with the lattice oxygen. CO disproportionation has been observed for finely dispersed Pd particles at = 325-375 K. This disproportionation is retarded over larger Pd particles formed by agglomeration process during the calcination process of FeSb04. Acknowledgements Authors are extremely grateful to Dr. J.P.

Kulshreshtha ∗ Chemistry Division, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Bombay-400 085, India ∗ Corresponding author. Based on 57Fe Mössbauer effect and powder X-ray diffraction measurements it is shown that amorphous FeSbO4 prepared by coprecipitation method, transforms to crystalline form at ⋍ 1125 K and during hydrogen reduction it decomposes to individual oxides like Fe3O4 and Sb2O3. On palladium impregnation, the reduction rate of FeSbO4 is enhanced due to spillover of activated hydrogen from Pd centres to support oxide. From the comparative study of the catalytic behaviour of α-Fe2O3, α-Sb2O4 and FeSbO4 for CO oxidation, it is observed that there are no synergistic effects between Fe3+ and Sb5+ ions. Pd impregnation facilitates CO oxidation and it occurs through lattice oxygen incorporation. Disproportionation of CO over finer particles of Pd supported over the surface of FeSbO4, has been observed in the temperature region 325–375 K.

        "dc:description": "Based on 57Fe Mössbauer effect and powder X-ray diffraction measurements it is shown that amorphous FeSbO4 prepared by coprecipitation method, transforms to crystalline form at ⋍ 1125 K and during hydrogen reduction it decomposes to individual oxides like Fe3O4 and Sb2O3. On palladium impregnation, the reduction rate of FeSbO4 is enhanced due to spillover of activated hydrogen from Pd centres to support oxide. From the comparative study of the catalytic behaviour of α-Fe2O3, α-Sb2O4 and FeSbO4 for CO oxidation, it is observed that there are no synergistic effects between Fe3+ and Sb5+ ions. Pd impregnation facilitates CO oxidation and it occurs through lattice oxygen incorporation. Disproportionation of CO over finer particles of Pd supported over the surface of FeSbO4, has been observed in the temperature region 325–375 K.",
