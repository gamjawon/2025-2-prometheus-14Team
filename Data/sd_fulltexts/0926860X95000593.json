CATALYSIS A GENERAL ELSEVIER Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (1995) 273-285 Effect of calcination conditions of the oxidized precursor on the structure of a sulfided K-Mo / y-A1203 catalyst for mixed alcohol synthesis Yi-lu Fu a, Kaoru Fujimoto b, Pei-yan Lin a, Konji Omata b, Ying-shun Yu b Department of Chemical Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230026, Anhui, China n Department of Applied Chemistry, Faculty of Engineering, University of Tokyo, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113, Japan Received 18 July 1994; revised 3 January 1995; accepted 20 February 1995 Abstract The effect of the calcination temperature and time of the oxidized precursor on the structure of a sulfided K-Mo/y-AI,03 catalyst was investigated by surface area analysis, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. The experimental results show that calcination of the oxidized precursor at high temperature leads to a surface sintering, whereby the surface areas of the samples decrease sharply. Because of the strong K-Mo interaction, various K-Mo-O phases are formed. These K-Mo-O phases are transformed to K-Mo-O-S and K-Mo-S phases during sulfidation. The K-Mo interaction species retard, to some extent, the sulfidation and reduction of molybdenum and result in an increase in Mov` content in the samples. The surface K+ ions are enriched and surface Cl- ions are partially lost after calcination. Three kinds of surface sulfur species are formed on the sulfided samples. Some sulfur species might be unstable and might be lost in the reactant stream. The synthesis of mixed alcohols was measured in a micro-reactor. It was found that calcination at 700-800 of the oxidized precursor is more beneficial for alcohol formation. The correlation between the activity, selectivity of mixed alcohols and the structures of the samples are discussed.

The relation between the structures and the reaction properties has recently been reported in the literature. Kim and Woo [4] studied the effect of sulfidation temperature for the formation of sulfides on Mo/A1203 and COMO/ A1203 catalysts. They found that the interaction between oxo-Mo5+ and alumina decreased as the sulfiding temperature increased and finally disappeared at 800, which is beneficial to form crystals of molybdenum disulfide. Woo et al. [5] investigated the oxidation of KZCOg/MOSZ catalysts in air and in vacuum at room temperature. They found that sulfate species were formed on the surface and the high selectivity shifted to C2+ hydrocarbons rather than alcohols on fresh samples. The effect of alkali promoters was studied with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy by DeCanio et al. [6] and they showed that reducibility of Mov` in Mo/y-A1203 catalysts was inhibited by potassium promotion. A new microcrystal phase composed of potassium ions and molybdenum disulfide was proposed by Duan et al. [7] on the surface of a KZCOg/MOSZ catalyst and they suggested it to be active for the synthesis of mixed alcohols. Zhang et al. [8] reported that a K-Mo-S phase and S-SZ- species existed on the MoS,~K+ /Si02 surface and claimed that potassium promotion resulted in a decrease of S-SZ- species and in an increase of the selectivity to alcohols. More recently, Jiang et al. [ 9 ] investigated K-Mo interaction in K-Mo03/y-AI203 catalysts, and found that K-Mo interacting species in the oxidic precursors might involve potassium cations and Mo7024 units which retarded the sulfidation and reduction of Movi to MoIv. The sulfidation of the interacting species led to the aggregation of MOS2 and the formation of surface KMo-S species. They suggested that the surface K-Mo-S species and Mo (CUS) sites were responsible for the alcohol and hydrocarbon formation, respectively. The goal of the present work is to investigate the effect of calcination conditions (temperature and time) of the oxidized precursors on the structures and the properties of mixed alcohol synthesis for a sulfided K-Mo/ y-A1203 catalyst. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation The support y-A1203 was obtained from Al (OH) 3 (Institute of Tianjing Chemical Engineering, China) by calcination at 750 for 16 h. The material was pelletized, ground and sieved to 40-60 mesh particle size (surface area: 270 M2/g). The oxidized samples were prepared by sequential impregnation of the support with aqueous KCl solution followed by drying and calcination at 300 for 1 h, and then with the aqueous ammonium hepta-molybdate solution, followed by drying and calcination at 500 for 24 h in oxygen atmosphere. Finally, the samples were calcined at several temperatures for some time in air. The molybdenum content for all the samples is 19.4% (wt. M003/wt. cat.) and the K/Mo atomic ratio is 0.8. Y-1. Fu et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (1995) 273-285 275 A hydrogen stream passed through liquid CSz at 0 was used as sulfiding gas. The sulfided samples were obtained by sulfiding the oxidized samples in a flow (30 ml/min) of CSz/HZ at 400 for 6 h. In this paper, the samples are denoted as: X (calcination temperature of oxidized samples) -Y (calcination hours) -Z (catalyst state, O: oxidized sample, S: sulfided sample, A: sample after reaction for 80 h). For example: 700-12-S indicates a sample which is calcined at 700 for 12 h and sulfided, etc. 2.2. Measurement of catalytic reaction The reaction was measured with a double-gas-line microreactor at high pressure. The diameter of the stainless steel reactor was 6 mm. The volume of catalyst bed was 1 ml. The temperature of the catalyst bed was measured by a thermocouple which was inserted in the middle of the bed. The bed temperature was controlled with an accuracy of 0.5. A 30-40 difference was observed between the middle of the bed and the outside wall of the reactor. This is caused by the release of reaction heat and the poor heat transfer for this kind of fixed bed reactor. The synthesis gas was composed of CO: 32.2%, Ar: 4.13% (internal standard gas) and H, to balance. Ar, CO and COZ were analyzed with a thermal conductivity detector in a GC-320 chromatograph (GL Science) with a 2 m active carbon column. Hydrogen was the carrier gas. The hydrocarbons, alcohol products and other oxygenated compounds were analyzed using a hydrogen flame detector in another gas chromatograph (GC-7, Shimadzu) with a 1.25 m Parapak R column. Nitrogen was the carrier gas. The composition of the products was calculated by effective carbon numbers using 1.0% CHq as the standard gas. 3. Catalyst characterization methods (1) Specific surface areas (SA) of the samples were measured with the BET method using nitrogen adsorption at 77 K. (2) Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Denki, Rotaflex, U-200) using Cu Ka radiation. (3) A transmission electron microscope (TEM) (JEM-2010, JEOL) was used for the imaging, and an energy dispersive spectroscope (EDS) (UTW, Si(Li) semiconductor detector) was used to measure the chemical composition at the marked points on the TEM photograph. (4) X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded by using a JPS-90 SX spectrometer (JEOL) with a Mg Ka source (1253.6 eV). The binding energies were corrected by using the C is (284.4 eV) and A1 2p (74.6 eV) peaks. (5) Analyses of the sulfur content in the samples were done by using a Total Sulfur Analyzer (SC-432, LECO Co.). 276 Y-1.

Results and discussions 4.1. SA measurement The specific surface areas of the oxidized and sulfided samples are listed in Table 1. It is shown that the surface areas of the samples decrease very fast. This implies that the sample surfaces sinter rather quickly with increasing temperature. For the sample calcined at 800 for 12 h, the SA is down to 4.2 M2/ g. At higher temperature (900) , the SA shows no notable change. After sulfidation, the SA of the samples decreases slightly. For the A1203 support, sintering obviously appears at about 950 which is the temperature of the phase transition (y, B to a). After molybdenum and potassium compounds were impregnated on the surface, the sintering temperature of the samples decreased remarkably. This implies that a strong interaction between the potassium promoter, molybdenum and support alumina exists. 4.2. Crystal phases analysis XRD patterns of the oxidized and sulfided samples were measured. The most probable phases in the samples were detected according to the standard data from JCPDS cards. The analytic results of the possible crystal phases for the oxidized and sulfided samples are listed in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively. Oxidized samples Several kinds of K-Mo-O phases exist in all of the oxidized samples. The peak intensities of a Ko.g5Mo6017 phase (d=0.3968, 0.2772, 0.1957, 0.1595, 0.1441 nm) are very strong in all of the samples. Other K-Mo-O phases, such as 6K2Mo7022 (d = 0.3698, 0.3143, 0.2849 nm), KZMo4013 (d = 0.3493, 0.3143, 0.2849 nm), K6M0209 (d=0.2730, 0.2578, 0.2191, 0.2127, 0.1737, 0.1512 nm), KZMO301o (d = 0.5215, 0.3278 nm) and KZM004 (d = 0.4529, 0.1488 nm) may also exist.

Along with the increase of the calcination temperature or the duration of the calcination time, the diffraction peaks of KZMo4013 and KZMo301o increased notably. Several new peaks of a KZMo4013 phase (d=0.6916, 0.3502, 0.2390 nm) became visible when the calcination temperature was more than 800 for 3 h. Besides the K-Mo-O phases, the alumina molybdate (d=0.3990, 0.3834 nm) and KCl (d=0.3134, 0.2270, 0.1807 nm) phases also exist clearly in the oxidized samples. The former increases with increasing temperature, however, the latter weakens remarkably after calcination above 700. A phase transition of the support alumina from y phase (d = 0.2392, 0.1989, 0.1397 nm) to B phase (d = 0.2730, 0.2442, 0.2287, 0.1542, 0.1451, 0.1391 nm) is found at 800. Sulfided samples After sulfidation, the crystal phases are quite different from the oxidized samples. Except for the diffraction peaks of the support and KCI, all the peaks of the KMo-O phases and aluminum molybdate vanish, and instead various Mo-S, K-MoO-S and K-Mo-S phases are observed.

Fu et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (1995) 273-285 The 500 calcination sample (500-24-S) differs considerably from other samples. Besides alumina, KCl and MOS2 (d=0.2730, 0.1573 nm) phases, K-Mo-OS and K-Mo-S phases are not detected. Along with the increase of the calcination temperature for the oxidized precursor, the KCl phase of the sulfided samples is obviously weakened, and the MoS,, phase is also decreased. Mean while, the peaks of the K,MoS4 phase (d=0.3453, 0.2959, 0.1910, 0.1486 nm) and K~MOOSj phase (d= 0.6194, 0.4506, 0.2304 nm) become more evident. Both of them possess Mov'. This means that the sulfidation and reduction of Mov'to Mo'v become more difficult for increasing calcination temperature. The used samples 500-24-A, 800-1-A and 800-12-A were also measured by XRD; they display no obvious changes, as compared with those before the reaction. 4.3. Valence and surface component analysis Valence of molybdenum The XPS spectra of Mo(3d) for the five oxidized samples calcined at different temperatures are almost the same as the standard data of molybdena [ 10] . The binding energies of Mo(3d5,2) and Mo(3d3,2) are 232.9 eV and 236.6 eV, respectively. The ratio of the peak areas for Mo(3d5,2) /MO(3d3,2) is 1.43. It is close to the theoretical ratio of 1.5. So, the valence of molybdenum for the oxidized samples is 6+. The XPS spectra of Mo (3d) after sulfidation of the oxidized precursors at 400 for 6 h, are shown in Fig. 1. The binding energy of Mo(3d) and the ratio of the two main peaks are listed in Table 4. The binding energies of the three molybdenum valences from the literature are also listed in this table. From Table 4 and Fig. 1, it is obvious that the binding energies of the two main peaks are 229.3 eV and 232.5 eV; the same as the standard data for MOS2, i.e., the valence of molybdenum is 4+. Besides two main peaks, a small peak of Mo(3d3,2) of 6+ valence situated at about 236.2 eV exists clearly. This peak increases gradually along with the increase of calcination temperature, up to a maximum at 700, and then becomes weak. In the mean time, the ratios of the peak areas of Mo(3d5,2)/Mo(3d3,2) decrease at first and down to a minimum (0.48) at 700, and then increase. According to the theoretical calculation and the experimental measurement, the ratio of the peak areas of Mo (3d5,2) /Mo(3d2) for a unique molybdenum valence should be 1.5. The existence of a Mo(3d3,2) peak of 6 + valence and the deviation of the area ratio of two main peaks from 1.5, both illustrate that not only 4 + valence molybdenum, but also some 6 + valence molybdenum exists on the surface. The content of Mov' is maximal in the 700-12-S sample. The Mov' in the samples may originate from the strong K-Mo interaction. As shown in XRD analysis, a number of K-Mo-O phases in the oxidized samples are difficult to reduce and sulfide from Mov' to Mo'v and they transform to some K-Mo-O-S and K-Mo-S phases, which contain Mov'. That is to say, the K-Mo-O phases retard, to some extent, the sulfidation and reduction of Mov' to Mo'v. Y -1.

XPS spectrum of S(2p) for the 800-12-S sample. samples have almost the same value (293.0 0.3 eV) and are the same as the standard data of KCl [ 10] . The XPS spectra of S (2p) are more complex. The spectrum of 800-12-S is shown in Fig. 2. There are three peaks situated at 162.3 eV, 163.4 eV (shoulder) and 168.6 eV. The main peak (162.3 eV) is SZ- which is close to that of MOS2 [ 10] . The binding energy of the shoulder peak (about 163.4 eV) is located between the binding energies of elemental sulfur (164 eV) and of the sulfur in MOS2 (162.1 eV). It was reported that di- and poly-sulfide species which contained S2- ligands had a binding energy between 162.3 and 164.6 eV [ 11,12] . The third small peak (168.6 eV) indicates that a small amount of high valence sulfur species, S (6 + ) , exists on the sample surface [ 10] . The existence of S (6 + ) was also reported in the literature [ 5,9,13 ] . The XPS spectra of S (2p) for the other four sulfided samples are rather similar to that of the 800-12-S sample. Surface atomic ratio The surface atomic ratio of Cl/K, K/Mo and S2-/Mo on the five sulfided samples were calculated from the peak areas of Mo (3d) , K(2p), CI (2p) and S (2p ) which were corrected by Wagner sensitivity factors [ 10] . The calculated results are listed in Table 5. As shown in this table, the unique Cl/K ratio is much lower than that of the added KCl promoter. It may be due to the loss of Cl- anions during sample preparation and the strong interaction of K+ cations with molybdenum sulfide species [9]. The K/Mo ratios of the samples increase with increasing calcination temperature and have a maximal value (4.78) for the 700-12-S sample surface. It is worth to note that the K/Mo ratios are always higher than that in the bulk of the sample (0.8) . The data from Table 5 show that an enrichment of the potassium cations onto the surface occurs especially for the 700-12-S and 800-12S samples. The phenomena of the Cl- loss and the K+ enrichment should be related. As we known, acid centers exist on the alumina surface, and the K+ ions, as a strong base, can react with these acid centers and substitute for H+, which then Y.-1.

On the other hand, because of the impregnation of the molybdenum compounds, the strong K-Mo interaction leads to enrichment of the surface with K+ cations. This may be important in the formation of a new active center for alcohol synthesis. The surface S2- / Mo ratios decrease with the increase of the calcination temperatures of the oxidized samples. It may originate from the inhibitory effect of K-Mo interaction on the sulfidation which is strengthened by the calcination of the oxidized precursors at high temperatures. 4.4. TEM and EDS measurement TEM photographs of four samples (500-24-S, 800-12-0, 800-12-S, 800-12-A) at different magnifications (3000, 15 000, 75 000, 750 000) were taken. The four photographs with the highest magnifications (750 000) are shown in Fig. 3a-d. For the sulfided samples a, c and d, they show a like-finger-veins layer structure on the sample surface. The interlayer distance is about 0.6 nm, corresponding to that of MOS2 crystal structure. This fact allows us to deduce that the layer structure might be that of MOS2 microcrystals. Comparing the photographs of a, c and d, the MOS2 microcrystals on the 800-12-S sample surface are more clear than those on the 500-24-S surface, and after reaction for 80 h, the surface morphology shows no remarkable change. An EDS analysis of the sulfur and molybdenum components at marked points on the TEM photographs for samples 800-12-S and 800-12-A was performed; the measured atomic percentages of sulfur and molybdenum are listed in Table 6. It is indicated that the average atomic ratio of sulfur and molybdenum at the selected points is almost the same. A total sulfur analysis was also made for the two samples. The measured total sulfur content for the 800-12-S sample is 8.4% and for the 800-12-A sample it is 6.4%. Therefore, after reaction for 80 h, the sulfur content in the sample has decreased somewhat. This fact can be explained by assuming that the lost sulfur is some unstable sulfur species, such as di- and poly-sulfide species, whereas the sulfur in the Mo-S, K-Mo-S, K-Mo-O-S compounds is more stable. 4.5.

The measured stable activity, selectivity and C,OH/ CZ+OH ratio after reaction for 16 h are shown in Fig. 4. It shows that when the oxidized precursors were calcined below 800, the alcohol activity (space-time yield, STY) and selectivity increase notably along with increasing calcination temperature, and in the mean time, the methanol content in the products also increases. Nevertheless, for the 900 calcined sample, the alcohol activity and selectivity decline sharply. In view of all this, the 800 calcined sample possesses the best activity and selectivity. It is interesting to note, although the surface area is very low because of serious sintering, for 800-12-S sample, the catalytic properties for the synthesis of mixed alcohols are quite good. This means that calcination at high temperature is necessary for the formation of reaction active centers. It was found that there were at least two kinds of species, Mo-S species and KMo-O-S, K-Mo-S species in the samples.

The latter originated from K-Mo interaction and were proposed to be responsible for alcohol formation [ 7-9 ] . The SA, XRD, XPS and TEM measurements in this work show that the sulfided samples of which the oxidized precursors are calcined at 700800, possess more K-Mo-S and K-Mo-O-S species, are more enriched in potassium ions and have more Movt on the surface than the other sulfided samples. All of the above results might be beneficial to alcohol formation and lead to an increase of alcohol activity and selectivity. Obviously, it is valuable to investigate the relation between the catalyst structures and reaction properties in more detail. Further work on this topic is in progress in our laboratory. 5. Conclusions The calcination of oxidized precursors of K-Mo/-y-A1203 catalysts at high temperatures leads to a surface sintering and the surface areas of the samples decrease sharply. Because of the strong K-Mo interaction, various K-Mo-O phases are formed and transformed to K-Mo-S and K-Mo-O-S phases after sulfidation. The K-Mo interaction species retard, to some extent, the sulfidation and reduction of molybdenum compounds, increase the proportion of high valence molybdenum on the surface and enrich the surface with potassium ions. Several surface sulfur species are formed on the sulfided samples. Some surface sulfur species might be unstable which could be lost during reaction. The synthesis of mixed alcohols was examined and this showed that the 700800 calcination of the oxidized precursor was advantageous to alcohol formation. The alcohol activity and selectivity can be correlated to the structures of the oxidized and sulfided samples.

The effect of the calcination temperature and time of the oxidized precursor on the structure of a sulfided K-Mo/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was investigated by surface area analysis, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. The experimental results show that calcination of the oxidized precursor at high temperature leads to a surface sintering, whereby the surface areas of the samples decrease sharply. Because of the strong KMo interaction, various KMoO phases are formed. These KMoO phases are transformed to KMoOS and KMoS phases during sulfidation. The KMo interaction species retard, to some extent, the sulfidation and reduction of molybdenum and result in an increase in MoVI content in the samples. The surface K+ ions are enriched and surface Cl− ions are partially lost after calcination. Three kinds of surface sulfur species are formed on the sulfided samples. Some sulfur species might be unstable and might be lost in the reactant stream. The synthesis of mixed alcohols was measured in a micro-reactor. It was found that calcination at 700°C–800°C of the oxidized precursor is more beneficial for alcohol formation. The correlation between the activity, selectivity of mixed alcohols and the structures of the samples are discussed.
