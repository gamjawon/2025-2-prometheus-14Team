The PdCl2â€�CuCl2/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared, and a high relative humidity deactivation mechanism was suggested after characterizing the fresh and spent catalyst by Xâ€�ray diffraction, N2 absorpâ€� tionâ€�desorption, Xâ€�ray photoelectron spectroscopy, H2â€�temperature programmed reduction and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy. The results showed that the water could adsorb and condense on the surface of the catalyst, which arouses the aggregation and transâ€� fer of Cu species into the internal pores of the catalyst. This weakens the interactions between the Pd and Cu species and reduces the reâ€�oxidation ability of Pd 0 to Pd 2+ , which blocks redox cycling and results in the decrease of CO oxidation activity.

Introduction CO is a toxic gas that is usually generated from chemical production processes, vehicles exhausting emissions, and inâ€� complete combustion of fossil fuels. Catalytic oxidation is an efficient method for CO removal, especially at low temperaâ€� tures. CO oxidation at lower temperatures has received wide attention as important practical applications in CO gas sensors, air purification, gas masks and closed system ventilation such as in submarines and spacecraft [1]. Composite oxides and noble metal catalysts can be used in CO oxidation. Oxide catalysts such as Hopcalite catalyst and Co3O4 can improve the CO oxidation activity. Co3O4 can oxidize CO even at â€“77 ï‚°C [2], but the trace water may cause catalyst deactivation [3]. Au, a typical noble catalyst, not only shows excellent CO oxidation activity [4], but also resists water [5]. Problems with Au catalysts, such as sensitivity to preparation conditions, halogen poisoning [6] and potential deactivation during storage [7], still limit its wider applications. Supported Pd catalysts show excellent performance for CO oxidation. When the Pd loading amount was 4 wt%, CO could be comâ€� pleted converted at â€“15 Â°C [8]. The supported Pd catalyst also has water resistance and halogen tolerance. Supported Wackerâ€�type catalysts (PdCl2â€�CuCl2) have high CO oxidation activity. PdCl2â€�CuCl2/Al2O3 prepared by NH3 coorâ€� dinationâ€�impregnation can completely convert CO at â€“30 Â°C [9] in 0.04% CO and 0.1% H2O. The reaction mechanism for CO oxidation on supported Wackerâ€�type catalysts was similar with that of homogeneous catalysts [10]: 22 2 CO + PdCl H O CO Pd(0) 2HClï€«ï‚¾ï‚®ï€« ï€« 22 Pd(0) 2CuCl PdCl 2CuClï€«ï‚¾ï‚®ï€« * Corresponding author.

Catal., Vol. 34, No. 5, May 2013 FENG Yafen et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 923â€“931 222 2CuCl 2HCl 1 / 2O 2CuCl H Oï€«ï€« ï‚¾ï‚®ï€« The active phases of Pd and Cu are the Pd 2+ and Cu2Cl(OH)3 species. Cu2Cl(OH)3 can accelerate the oxidation of lower vaâ€� lence Pd that would promote the redox cycle [11]. In this reacâ€� tion cycle, some results showed that the rate determining step (RDS) was of the reâ€�oxidation of Cu + [12]. Pd 0 oxidization to Pd + by Cu 2+ was also suggested to be a RDS [13]. Having water in the feed gas is inevitable for most practical applications. However, the presence of water has been reportâ€� ed to promote CO oxidation on supported Wackerâ€�type cataâ€� lysts [14]. The presence of water increases the CO oxidation rate by 2â€“3 times [15], but the excess water could adsorb onto the catalyst surface, covering the active sites and increasing the mass transfer resistant. For the hydrophilic support (such as Al2O3), capillary condensation of water can also occur inside the pores, which causes deactivation of the catalyst [12]. It was also reported that losing Cl â€� ions can also cause catalyst deactiâ€� vation as Cl â€� ions are essential to maintain the redox cycle. CO oxidation activity is directly related to the coordination number of Cl â€“ ions surrounded Pd 2+ [16]. Previous research also conâ€� firmed that the deactivation of the catalyst was related to the state of the Cu species [17]. In this paper, differences in the structure, surface and redox prosperities of fresh and spent catalysts are studied to investiâ€� gate the deactivation mechanism for CO oxidation on PdCl2â€�CuCl2/Al2O3 catalysts at high relative humidity (100%). 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation Supported Wackerâ€�type catalyst (PdCl2â€�CuCl2/Al2O3) was prepared by the NH3 coordinationâ€�impregnation method, where the content of PdCl2 and CuCl2 was represented by their weight ratios, which was 1.5% and 3.3% respectively. The catâ€� alyst was labeled as 1.5 wt% Pdâ€�3.3 wt% Cu/Al2O3. CO oxidaâ€� tion activity of a fresh catalyst, denoted as F, was evaluated at 25 Â°C, with 100% relative humidity of feed gas, and a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 15000 ml/(gÂ·h). When CO conversion decreased to 10%, the deactivated catalyst was regenerated in air at 50 Â°C for 10 h, and then the same evaluaâ€� tion experiment was repeated. After several deactivaâ€� tionâ€�regeneration cycles, the obtained catalyst was labeled as D. The same preparation were employed on both catalysts PdCl2 /Al2O3 and CuCl2/Al2O3, denoted as 1.5 wt% Pd/Al2O3 and 3.3 wt% Cu/Al2O3. 2.2. Water adsorption experiment A water adsorption experiment was conducted at ambient temperature in a quartz Uâ€�tube reactor; 0.2 g catalyst was used. 50 ml/min N2 was directed through a water vapor saturator, and then flowed into reactor. The weight of the reactor was measured at a fixed time to obtain the water adsorption rate. 2.3. Characterization The powder Xâ€�ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of sample were performed on a Brook D8 focus diffraction spectrometer with Cu K ï�¡ radiation at room temperature. The following paâ€� rameters were used; incident wave length 0.15 nm, electric current 40 mA, power voltage 40 kV, scanning angle 10Â°â€“80Â°, scanning rate 2Â°/min. Elemental analysis of Pd and Cu was carried out with inducâ€� tively coupled plasmaâ€�atomic emission spectrometry (ICPâ€�AES) instruments (Varian 710ES, Varian Co. Palo Alto, US). Xâ€�ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were acâ€� quired with an AXIS Ultra DLD spectrometer using Mgâ€�KÎ± (hÎ½ = 1253.6 eV) radiation. Charged samples were avoided by setting the binding energy of adventitious carbon (C 1s) to 284.8 eV. N2 adsorptionâ€�desorption isotherms were measured using an ASAP 2010 apparatus at 77 K, where the samples were deâ€� gassed at 200 Â°C before each measurement. Temperatureâ€�programmed reduction (H2â€�TPR) of an unreâ€� duced catalyst was carried out in equipment made by Penxiang Co. (Tianjing, China). A sample of 100 mg was used and the experiments were performed by heating the sample under 5% H2/N2 flow rate (45 ml/min) from ambient temperature to 450ï‚°C at a rate of 10ï‚°C/min. A TCD detector recorder the H2 consumption with CuO used as the reference for calculation. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform specâ€� troscopy (DRIFTS) of CO adsorbed onto the catalyst was measâ€� ured on a Nicolet Nexus 670 spectrometer. The DRIFTS spectra were obtained at 25ï‚°C. (1) The mixture gases of 0.15% CO + Ar flowed through the sample cell and the spectra recorded every 2â€“5 min; (2) O2 (5% and 20%) was added to the mixture gas (1) above, and the spectra recorded every 2â€“5 min; (3) ~0.6% H2O was added to the mixture gases (2) above, and the spectra recorded every 2â€“5 min. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Testing of the catalyst A 0.15% CO was completely oxidized at â€“10 Â°C using fresh catalyst (1.5 wt% Pdâ€�3.3 wt% Cu/Al2O3â€�F) when the content of H2O in the feed gas was 0.1% H2O and the WHSV was 15000 ml/(gÂ·h). The stability of the catalyst was investigated at 25 Â°C, 100% relative humidity and WHSV 15000 ml/(gÂ·h), with the results shown in Fig. 1. The CO oxidation rate gradually deâ€� creased with increased reaction time, decreasing from 93% to 10% in 25 h. The activity of deactivated catalyst could be reâ€� covered after their regeneration in dry air and the stability of the regenerated and fresh catalysts were similar as a function of reaction time. Although the initial CO conversion on the reâ€� generated catalyst did not noticeably decrease after several deactivationâ€�regeneration cycles, the deactivation rate of cataâ€� lyst was found to accelerate. 3.2. Water adsorption rate on catalysts with different composition The water adsorption rates of catalysts with different comâ€� positions are shown in Fig. 2. For the pure Al2O3 support, the FENG Yafen et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 923â€“931 water adsorption rate reached 9% in the first 2 h. With inâ€� creasing adsorption time, water adsorption also increased slowly. Saturated water adsorption (10%) was obtained after 10 h. The saturated water adsorption was 13% on PdCl2/Al2O3 and 20% on 3.3 wt% Cu/ Al2O3, which was induced by the high solubility and easy melting of CuCl2. The saturated water adâ€� sorption of 1.5 wt% Pdâ€�3.3 wt% Cu/Al2O3 was between that of Pd/Al2O3 and Cu/Al2O3, which suggested that the deposition of Pd species inhibited Cu species in adsorbing water. 3.3. XRD characterization The XRD patterns of fresh and spent 1.5 wt% Pdâ€�3.3 wt% Cu/Al2O3 catalysts are shown in Fig. 3. For fresh catalysts, only the characteristic peaks of the Î³â€�Al2O3 phase could be observed, and no Pd or Cu species were detected. It was indicated that the Pd and Cu species were highly dispersed on the alumina surâ€� face. Some Pd loading may be below the detection limit of the XRD equipment. On spent catalysts, Cu2(OH)3Cl and CuCl could be clearly detected, indicating highly dispersed Cu species are aggregated on the support surface. The presence of CuCl may be caused by the reduction of CO. 3.4. BET surface area and composition of catalyst The surface area of the catalysts were measured by N2 adâ€� sorptionâ€�desorption, and are listed in Table 1. The surface area of the fresh catalyst (173 m 2 /g) was smaller than that of the support (200 m 2 /g), which is likely to be attributed to the acâ€� tive species blocking some pores of the catalyst. The surface area of the spent catalyst (197 m 2 /g) was larger than the that of the fresh catalyst. From the results in Figs. 2 and 3, it can be noted that the adsorption and condensation of water on the catalyst surface may induce the dissolution and aggregation of Cu species. Simultaneously, partial Cu species transferred from the surface opens the internal pores blocked by the active speâ€� cies, which increases the surface area of the spent catalyst. The loadings of Pd and Cu species onto the fresh and spent catalysts are kept the same, as shown in Table 1. This indicates that the active components were not lost during the reaction. The XPS spectra of Pd and Cu on the fresh and spent 1.5 wt% Pdâ€�3.3 wt% Cu/Al2O3 catalyst are shown in Fig. 4, and the surface composition and the chemical state are listed on Table 1. For the fresh catalyst, Pd exists in the form of Pd 2+ and Cu exists in the forms of Cu + and Cu 2+ . The molar ratio of Cu/Pd on the surface (3.35) was close to the catalyst composition (3.68), which suggests that there is a uniform distribution of Pd and Cu species on the fresh catalyst surface. There were obvious differences in the chemical state of Pd and Cu between the fresh and spent catalysts. As well as Pd 2+ , Pd + and Pd 0 were also detected on the spent catalyst surface. This was because of the partial reduction of the catalyst by CO in the feed gas. Simultaneously, the surface concentration of Pd increased from 0.23% to 0.72%, while the concentration of Cu decreased from 0.77% to 0.59%. With the BET results, it can be suggested that some Cu species dissolved in the condensed water on the surface and migrated into the pores. This would expose the previously covered Pd species. The aggregation and migration of Cu species can break the closeâ€�knit structure of the Pdâ€�Cu species and decrease their interactions. This can hinder the oxidation of Pd by Cu 2+ , which then blocks the recycling of CO oxidation [11].

FENG Yafen et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 923â€“931 amount of Cl â€“ for the fresh and spent catalysts, which suggests that loss of Cl â€“ was not the main reason for deactivation. 3.5. H2â€�TPR To further investigate the interactions between the Pd and Cu species, the effects of Cu content on the redox properties of the catalysts were studied under the same conditions as those used for fixed Pd loading, with the results shown in Fig. 5 and Table 2. The TPR of Pd/Al2O3 reveals a peak around 39 ï‚°C. Two reâ€� duction peaks (237 and 308 Â°C) found for CuCl2/Al2O3 can be ascribed to the reduction of Cu 2+ to Cu + and Cu + to Cu. The TPR of the Pdâ€�Cu/Al2O3 samples exhibited two peaks in the range of 100â€“200 Â°C and 200â€“350 Â°C. The lower temperature peak can be attributed to the reduction of the Pd species (peak A) and the strong interaction of the Cu and Pd species (peak B), while the higher temperature peak (Peak C) indicates the reduction of the isolated Cu species [9]. It was indicated that introducing the Cu species decreased the reduction of the Pd species and enhanced the reduction of Cu species. With increased Cu loadâ€� ing, the reduction peaks of the catalysts were shifted to a higher temperature. It was indicated that for all the catalysts, the H2 consumption of the Pd species were kept constant with the same Pd loading. The calculated H2 consumption of the catalysts with different composition showed that the amount of Cu species is strongly related to that of the Pd species. With increased Cu amount, the Pd species was also increased (Peak B). Combined with the CO oxidation activities of the catalysts, it was suggested that the rate of activity increases with an increased amount of Cu speâ€� cies, which corresponds to Peak B.

The aggregation and transformation of Cu species in the presence of H2O decreased the interactions between the Pd and Cu species, and inhibited CO oxidation. 3.6. In situ DRIFTS To further investigate the deactivation mechanism of the catalysts, in situ DRIFTS technology was employed to study the properties of CO adsorption and oxidation on fresh and spent catalysts, with the results shown in Fig. 6. Figure 6(F) shows that the CO adsorption peaks of Pd 2+ â€�CO (2160 cm â€“1 ) [18] and Cu + â€�CO (2120 cm â€“1 ) were observed on the fresh catalyst in the presence of 0.15% CO/Ar. With inâ€� creased contact time, the Pd 2+ â€�CO peak decreased, but new peaks of Pd2 0 â€�CO (1993 cm â€“1 ) and Pd + â€�CO (1933 cm â€“1 ) [19] were detected. The peak intensity of Cu + â€�CO also significantly increased. This could be ascribed to the partial reduction of the Pd and Cu species by CO in the reaction gas. The adsorption of Cu 2+ â€�CO could not be observed as the adsorption of CO on Cu 2+ was unstable [20]. After 5% O2 was introduced into the feed gas, the adsorpâ€� tion peaks of Cu + â€�CO, Pd2 0 â€�CO and Pd + â€�CO decreased noticeably, particularly for the Pd2 0 â€�CO and Pd + â€�CO peaks. However, the Pd 2+ â€�CO peak increased. With O2 concentration increasing to 20%, the peaks of Pd2 0 â€�CO and Pd + â€�CO further decreased, but the Pd 2+ â€�CO peak continued to increase while the Cu + â€�CO peak was almost the same. It was indicated that the presence of O2 in the feed gas promoted the oxidation of Cu + to Cu 2+ , which furâ€� ther accelerated the oxidation of the Pd species with low vaâ€� lences, namely Cu 2+ + Pd + /Pd 0 â†’ Cu + + Pd 2+ . When ~0.6% water was introduced into the mixture gases, all the CO adsorption peaks decreased rapidly. Only weak Pd 2+ â€�CO peak and broad peaks of Cu + â€�CO and Pd + â€�CO were obâ€� servable after 15 min. Figure 6(D) showed that only the Cu + â€�CO and Pd + â€�CO peaks were observed for the spent catalyst in the presence of 0.15% CO/Ar, and peaks intensified with contact time. XPS results showed the presence of 0.22% Pd 2+ on the surface of the cataâ€� lyst, but no Pd 2+ â€�CO peak was detected; this may be induced by the reduction of Pd 2+ by CO. The aggregation of the Cu species weakens the interactions between the Pd and Cu species, which blocks the reâ€�oxidation of Pd species by Cu species and leads to the disappearance of the Pd 2+ â€�CO peak. After 5% O2 was added in the gas mixture, the peaks of Cu + â€�CO and Pd + â€�CO decreased noticeably. However, Pd 2+ â€�CO peak could still be observed. When the CO concentration inâ€� creased to 20%, the Pd 2+ â€�CO peak was strengthened, while the peaks of Cu + â€�CO and Pd + â€�CO gradually decreased, Pd + â€�CO in particular. Similar trends were noted for the fresh catalyst where the presence of water promoted the oxidation of Cu + . With the XRD and XPS results, it was suggested that the presâ€� ence of water leads to the aggregation and migration of Cu speâ€� cies, which decreases the surface concentration of Cu 2+ and weakens the interactions between Pd and Cu species. This reâ€� duces the reâ€�oxidation ability of the Pd species, blocking the redox cycle and accelerating the deactivation of the catalyst. 4. Conclusions This paper studied the stability of PdCl2â€�CuCl2/Al2O3 for CO oxidation under high relative humidity. The structure and surâ€� face properties of fresh and spent catalysts were characterized to determine their deactivation mechanism. At high relative humidity (100%), the water in the feed gases could be adâ€� sorbed and condensed on the catalyst surface, which promoted the aggregation and migration of the Cu species. A suggested migration model is shown in Fig. 7. The transfer of the Cu speâ€� cies into the internal pores decreased the surface Cu/Pd ratio on the catalysts and weakened the interaction between Pd and Cu species. This reduces the redox properties of the catalyst.

Tel: +86-21-64253703 Supported Wacker catalysts exhibited high activity for low temperature CO oxidation, but high concentrations of water in the reaction gas could lead to the deactivation of the catalyst. The PdCl2-CuCl2/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared, and a high relative humidity deactivation mechanism was suggested after characterizing the fresh and spent catalyst by X-ray diffraction, N2 absorption-desorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, H2-temperature programmed reduction and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy. The results showed that the water could adsorb and condense on the surface of the catalyst, which arouses the aggregation and transfer of Cu species into the internal pores of the catalyst. This weakens the interactions between the Pd and Cu species and reduces the re-oxidation ability of Pd0 to Pd2+, which blocks redox cycling and results in the decrease of CO oxidation activity. 摘要 采用X射线衍射、N2吸-脱附、X射线光电子能谱分析、氢气-程序升温还原和原位红外漫反射等方法对新鲜和失活的PdCl2-CuCl2/Al2O3低温催化CO氧化催化剂进行表征, 研究了高相对湿度(100%)下催化剂的失活机理. 结果表明, 催化剂表面沉积的水使得活性铜物种容易从催化剂表面向载体孔道内部迁移, 由于Pd、Cu相互作用弱化从而减弱了Pd与Cu物种间的相互作用, 使得催化剂的氧化还原性能受到影响, 抑制了Pd0再氧化为Pd2+的过程, 从而因CO氧化反应中催化剂氧化还原循环受阻而导致失活.
