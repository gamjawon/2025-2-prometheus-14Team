Rao Chemistry Department, Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi 110 016, India Received 23 April 1996; accepted 17 December 1996 Abstract The organic polymer and alumina anchored vanadyl and molybdenyl complexes were found to be effective for the oxidation of benzoin with tert-butylhydroperoxide as oxidant. With some of the catalysts only benzil was formed, whereas with others three products, benzil, methyl benzoate and benzoic acid, were formed. The anchored molybdenum complexes were observed to be better catalysts than anchored vanadium complexes for the oxidation of benzoin. With the organic polymer anchored M002(salphen) catalyst, 89% of benzoin to benzil was formed. The effect of ligand, metal and support on the catalytic activity for the oxidation of benzoin has been studied.

Introduction Vanadyl and molybdenyl complexes are known to catalyse the epoxidation of allylic alcohols [1-4] with ButO2H in a highly regioselective manner. Though the oxidations of alcohol to ketones with ButO2H catalysed by vanadyl and molybdenyl complexes have been reported [5,6), the oxidation of a-ketol with ButO2H has not been studied. Most of the studies regarding the oxidation of benzoin, one of the most common a-ketol, have been concerned with the air oxidation of benzoin to benzil with Con [7], Cu, Niu [8], Movl [9] complexes.

P11 S1381-1169(97)00013-7 ButO2H oxidant was of interest since ButO2H is one of the best sources of oxygen atoms from the point of view of economics, selectivity and safety. But02H is essentially inert to most organic molecules in the absence of catalysts and so catalysts can be used to push the oxidation reaction in pre-determined directions in a highly selective fashion. The oxidation of benzoin with ButOZH catalysed by chromium(VI) oxide has been reported by Muzart [ 10,11). However, a very low yield of benzil (34%) was reported. Besides the chromium residues formed are toxic and thus not attractive. As the anchored vanadyl and molybdenyl catalysts prepared by us proved to be effective for catalysing the oxidation of sulfoxides [12] to sulfones with ButOZH, these were also used in the oxidation of benzoin. To understand the 172 RX Bhatia, G.N. Rao /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 121 (1997) 171-178 effect of ligand, metal and support on the oxidation of benzoin with Bu`02H, the organic polymer and alumina anchored vanadyl complexes of salicylaldoxime (sal-H)2, 3-2 (thenoyl1,1,1-trifluoroacetylacetone) (TTA) and o-phenylene-bis-salicylaldimine (salphen) and molybdenum complexes of salicylaldoxime (sal-H)2 and o-phenylene-bis-salicylaldimine (salphen) were again employed as catalysts. In this paper we report studies on the variation in product yields and reaction time for the catalytic oxidation of benzoin with Bu`02H as oxidant and anchored catalysts. To study the effect of support, ligand and metal on the oxidation of benzoin, the organic polymer anchored complexes of VO(TTA)2, VO(sal-H)2, V O (salphen), M o0 2(sal-H )2 and M002(salphen) and alumina anchored complexes of VO(TTA)2,V0(sal-H)2, VO(salphen) were used. Chloromethylated polystyrene-divinylbenzene and polystyrene were used as organic supports and y-alumina as inorganic support. 2. Experimental Chloromethylated Merrifield's peptide resin (1 % crosslinked, 200-400 mesh and having approximately 1 mequiv. Cl/g) was purchased from Aldrich. XAD-4 resin (polystyrene, 20-50 mesh) was purchased from Merck, Fluka. yalumina (Neutral-Beckmann grade 1 for chromatography) was purchased from BDH. Tertbuty1hydroperoxide solution (70%) was purchased from Aldrich and used without further purification. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet DXFTIR instrument and thermograms on a Stanton Redcroft STA-780 thermal analyser. The metal-ion content in the polymer beads was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry after digestion of the beads with acid. HPLC was done on waters (501 /810) instrument using a ft, bondapack C 18 column of 30 cm length and 3.9 mm diameter and a UV-visible detector (LC 481).

Molybdenum complexes, M002(salphen) [14] and M002(sal-H)2 [15] were prepared according to the literature procedure and characterised by elemental analysis (Table 1). 2.1. Preparation of polymer supported Mo02 (sal-H)2 The salicylaldoxime ligand was first anchored on to the chloromethylated Merrifield's resin by heating with stirring the polymeric beads (10 g) with the ligand (5 g) and sodium ethoxide (0.2 g) in tetrahydrofuran (150 ml) at 65 for 24 h. The polymeric beads functionalised with the ligand were filtered out and then stirred with M002(sal-H)2 (3 g) in toluene (150 ml) at 110 for 30 h. The polymeric beads were then filtered out and soxhlet extracted with acetonitrile (yield: 12 g). 2.2. Preparation of polymer supported M002(salphen) The anchoring of M002(salphen) on functionalised XAD-4 beads [ 12] was carried out in the same way as the anchoring of M002(sal-H)2 on chloromethylated polystyrene beads. 2.3. Oxidation of benzoin 1 g of the anchored catalyst was placed in 20 ml of methanol. To this 0.6 g (2.84 mmol) of benzoin and 4.5 ml (35 mmol) of Bu`02H were added and the reaction mixture was stirred magnetically at a constant temperature of 60. RX. Bhatia, G.N. Rao /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 121 (1997) 171-178 Small portions (0.5 ml) of the solution were periodically removed after 30 min by syringe and analysed by HPLC after suitable dilution. For HPLC analysis, lcc bondapack C,8 column (30 cm length and 3.9 mm diameter) was used. The mobile phase used was 80o methanol at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. 2.4. Recycling of the catalysts The catalysts isolated by filtration after the oxidation of benzoin were used again for con- 41 secutive runs which were carried out in the same way as the first run. 2.5. Characterization of polymer supported metal complexes The anchored complexes were characterised by infrared spectra and thermogravimetric analysis.

The characterization of polymer and alumina anchored vanadyl complexes using infrared and thermogravimetric data has been described in our previous communications [12,13]. The presence of the Mo02 moiety on the polymer was confirmed by the presence of two bands at 850 cm-' and 915 cm-' assigned to the v.ym and vSym (O=Mo---(3) [16] the infrared spectrum of P-Mo02(sal-H)2 (Fig. 1) but absent in the spectrum of chloromethylated polymer (Fig. 2) and P-salicylaldoximate. Due to large overlapping of bands in the 1400-1700 cm-t region in the infrared spectra of supported ligand arid molybdenum complex, the VC -N vibration which is indicative of the mode of coordination does not impart any information. The presence of molybdenum on the polymer (30.8 mg of Mo in 1 g of resin) was confirmed by quantitative determination of molybdenum by atomic absorption spectroscopy after acid digestion of the sample and this was supported by therrnogravetric analysis. The therrnogram of P-Mo02(sal-H)2 shows a residue (equal to 4% of sample weight taken) at 174 L a E Fig. 3. FM002(salphen). R.K. Bhatia, G.N.

Results and discussion The oxidation of benzoin with But02 H, when carried out in the absence of catalyst, was very slow and low yields of benzil were obtained even when the reaction was allowed to proceed for a longer time (up to 32 h). Experiments were carried out using (i) the organic polymer without ligand and metal complex and (ii) the organic polymer functionalised with only the ligand. It was observed that neither of the above catalysed the oxidation of benzoin. However, alumina did catalyse the oxidation of benzoin to a very limited extent. With the anchored catalyst the reaction was faster. Thus, the oxidation of benzoin with all the polymer and alumina anchored catalysts using BUt02H oxidant was carried out under very similar conditions and the products analysed by HPLC. The metal-ion content of the supported catalysts and the yields of the product benzil obtained are given in Table 2. It was observed that with some of the catalysts, methyl benzoate and benzoic acid were also obtained along with benzil. As three different products were obtained, the catalytic activity was compared on the basis of the amount of benzoin consumed in the reaction. Since the aim was to study the effect of ligand, metal and support on the variation of catalytic activity, the observations may be grouped as follows. The order of catalytic activity is 1. P-VO(TTA)2 > P-VO(sal-H)2 > P- VO(salphen) 2. P-Mo02(salphen) > P-Mo02(sal-H)2 3. A-VO(TTA)2 > A-VO(sal-H)2 > A- VO(salphen) 4. A-Mo02(salphen) > A-Mo02(sal-H)2 Vanadyl and molybdenyl complexes catalyse the oxidation reactions with But02H by polarising the 0-O bond in the hydroperoxides and thus facilitating its heterolysis. The oxidation products are then formed by transfer of electropositive oxygen from the metal activated hydroperoxide to the subtrate. The tendency of a metal complex to facilitate the heterolysis of the 175 O-O bond in the hydroperoxide oxidation reaction is influenced by its Lewis acidity as the main function of the catalyst is to withdraw electrons from the peroxidic oxygen of the hydroperoxide and in doing so the catalyst is acting as a Lewis acid [l71. The Lewis acidity of the catalysts will be influenced by the metal present in the catalyst and also by nature of the ligands surrounding the metal-ion. As in the present case there are three variables, support, metal and ligand, to study the effect of ligand, the metal and support were kept constant. 3.1. Catalytic activity of polymer anchored uanadyl complexes The oxidation of benzoin with the polymer anchored vanadyl complexes of three different ligands TTA, salicylaldoxime and salphen was carried out for a fixed interval of time, i.e. 6 h, and the products were analysed by HPLC. With all the three catalysts, three products, benzil, methyl benzoate and benzoic acid, were formed. So the catalytic activity was compared on the basis of benzion consumed and can be grouped as follows: P-VO(TTA)2 > P-VO(sal-H)2 > P-VO(salphen). For the polymer anchored vanadyl complexes on the basis of Lewis acidity, the catalytic activity is expected to follow the order: PVO(TTA)2 > P-VO(salphen) > P-Val-H)2. The lower catalytic activity of P-VO(salphen) as compared to P-VO(sal-H)2 may be ascribed to the larger steric hindrance in P-VO(salphen). Similar trends were observed in the oxidation of dimethylsulfoxide to dirnethylsulfone with ButOOH oxidant and the polymer supported vanadyl complex catalysts [ 121. 3.2. Catalytic activity of alumina anchored uanadyl complexes The vanadyl complexes supported on alumina showed the same order of catalytic activity 176 R.K. Bhatia, G.N. Rao /Journal ofMolecularCatalysisA: Chemical 121 (1997) 171-178 Table 2 Yields of the products with different catalysts Catalyst Metal ion content/g of support (mg) Benzoin (%) Benzil (%) Methyl benzoate (%) Benzoic acid (%) P-VO(TTA)2 39.2 41.2 6.5 30.7 21.6 P-VO(sal-H)2 33.6 48.9 8.8 24.4 17.9 P-VO(salphen) 34.2 53.9 18.8 13.4 13.9 P-MO02(sal-H)2 30.8 21.8 42.8 9.7 25.7 P-MoOz(salphen) 28.2 10.4 89.6 - - A-VO(TTA)2 23.3 37.1 61.9 1.0 - A-VO(sal-H)2 27.9 40.7 22.5 19.8 16.9 A-VO(salphen) 22.1 58.4 41.6 - - A-Mo0z(sal-H)2 24.6 58.2 41.8 - - A-MOOZ(salphen) 26.0 28.4 71.4 - - Without catalyst - 81.4 11.8 - 6.8 Polymer - 81.1 11.9 - 7.0 Alumina - 62.3 37.7 - - MoOZ(salphen) - 7.8 79.6 3.4 9.2 P = organic polymer matrix, A = alumina, reaction time = 6 h. as the polymer anchored vanadyl complexes, i.e., A-VO(TTA)2 > A-VO(sal-H)2 > AVO(salphen). The variation in catalytic activity from the order expected on the basis of Lewis acidity may be ascribed to the same reason as for the polymer anchored complexes. 3.3. Catalytic activity of polymer anchored molybdenyl complexes In the polymer anchored molybdenyl complexes, the order of catalytic activity was that expected on the basis of increasing Lewis acidity of the coordinated ligand, i.e., PM002(salphen) > P-M002(sal-H)2. The steric effects of the coordinated ligands did not seem to be equally important in the anchored molybdenyl complexes, as the anchored M002(salphen) complex showed higher catalytic activity than the anchored Mo02(salH)2 complex. With the P-MO02(sal-H)2 catalyst, all the three products diketone, ester and acid were formed. As with the P-MO02(salphen) catalyst a very high conversion of benzion to benzil was observed, this oxidation reaction was monitored by HPLC. Samples were withdrawn after one hour and analysed by HPLC and the results are reported in Table 3. It was observed that the reaction was over in 4 h and no further change was observed after that. 3.4. Catalytic activity of alumina anchored molybdenyl complexes Among the A-MO02(salphen) and AMo02(sal-H)2 catalysts the A-Mo02(salphen) catalyst was observed to be more effective for the oxidation of benzoin, thus supporting the ligand effect observed with the same complexes supported on organic polymer support. 3.5. Effect of metal Regarding the effect of variation of metal on the catalytic activity, it was observed that anchored molybdenyl complexes were much better catalysts than the vanadyl complexes with the 1 2 3 4 5 Table 3 Yields of benzil with P-MOOZ(salphen) in the first run Time (h) Benzoin (%) Benzil (%) 24.7 19.8 13.5 10.8 10.4 75.3 80.2 86.5 89.2 89.6 R.K. Bhatia, GA Rao JJournal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 121 (1997) 171-178 same ligands. One reason for this could be the Lewis acidity and on this basis the molybdenum(VI) complexes are expected to be better catalysts than vanadium(V) complexes having the same ligands. Besides, the higher catalytic activity of the molybdenum complexes as compared to the corresponding vanadium complexes has also been reported by Sheldon and Van Doom [18] for the epoxidation of olefins. Another reason for the lower catalytic activity of vanadyl complexes could be the greater oxidising ability of V(V) as compared to Mo(VI). Under similar environments, V(V) catalyses the unimolecular decomposition of hydroperoxides more effectively than Mo(VI) [19]. Besides, the autoretardation by the coproduct ButOH formed in the oxidation reaction with tert-butyl hydroperoxide oxidant is more in reactions catalysed with vanadium complexes than molybdenum complexes. 3.6. Effect of support The results of the oxidation of benzoin with the alumina anchored vanadyl complexes could not be compared directly with the polymer anchored complexes, as alumina itself catalysed the oxidation reaction and the amount of vanadium was less in the complexes anchored on alumina support. However the ligand effect was prevalent in alumina anchored complexes. 3.7. Catalytic activity of non-anchored Mo02(salphen) catalyst As the anchored Mo02(salphen) was found to be very effective for the oxidation of benzoin, the same oxidation reaction with the nonanchored complex was carried out for comparison. The oxidation reaction was carried out under similar conditions and for the same amount of time. It was observed that besides benzil (79.6%), methyl benzoate (3.4%) and benzoic acid (9.2%) were also formed. Though on the basis of amount of benzoin consumed, the non-anchored 1 2 4 S 177 Table 4 Yields of benzil with P-Mo0z(salphen) in the second run Time (h) Benzoin (o) Benzil f7 o) 27.8 22.3 20.4 19.7 18.6 72.2 77.7 79.6 80.3 81.4 Mo02(salphen) complex showed higher catalytic activity than the anchored complex, it gave lesser yield for benzil and the methyl ester and acid products were also formed. Thus for the oxidation of benzoin to benzil, the anchored M002(salphen) complex catalyst was observed to be more effective. It is evident from the results in Table 2 that the best catalyst for the oxidation of benzoin to benzil is the Mo02(salphen) complex supported on the organic polymer support. Using the PMo02(salphen) catalyst, 89.6% of benzil was obtained after 6 h. This reaction was allowed to proceed for a longer time to see if it would go to completion, but no further change was observed in the amount of benzion consumed. The Mo02(salphen) complex anchored on alumina was also a good catalyst for oxidation of benzion to benzil and 71.4% of benzil was formed. 3.8. Recycling of catalyst The P-Mo02(salphen) catalyst isolated at the end of the oxidation of benzoin was used for successive runs and the results are reported in Table 4. It was observed that the catalytic activity decreased slightly in the second run (81.4%). This could be due to small extent of leaching of molybdenum metal from the catalyst. References [11 K.B.

Rao ∗ Chemistry Department, Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi 110 016, India ∗ Fax: + 91-11-6862037. The organic polymer and alumina anchored vanadyl and molybdenyl complexes were found to be effective for the oxidation of benzoin with tert-butylhydroperoxide as oxidant. With some of the catalysts only benzil was formed, whereas with others three products, benzil, methyl benzoate and benzoic acid, were formed. The anchored molybdenum complexes were observed to be better catalysts than anchored vanadium complexes for the oxidation of benzoin. With the organic polymer anchored MoO2 (salphen) catalyst, 89% of benzoin to benzil was formed. The effect of ligand, metal and support on the catalytic activity for the oxidation of benzoin has been studied.
