Box 11, The Heath, Runcorn, Cheshire WA7 4QE (U.K.) (Received November 15, 1983) Summary The codimerisation of 1,3-butadiene with 1-substituted 2,7-octadienes, especially l-acetoxy-2,7-octadiene, in the presence of a homogeneous Rh(III) catalyst gives mainly three types of linear and branched 1-substituted dodecatriene isomers. The influence of the substrate structure on the isomer ratio is described. The catalyst is poisoned by donor molecules such as phos- phines, amines and even molecular nitrogen. By contrast, non-phosphine promoters greatly increase the catalyst activity. Ally lie chlorides and hydrated chromium(III) chloride are particularly effective; hydrogen acts as a co-promoter. The scope of these new promoter systems in increasing turn- over numbers are explored. A mechanism is proposed for the catalytic cycle, catalyst deactivation and regeneration by organic halides. The catalyst is deactivated during the course of the reaction by the dodecatriene products. Introduction Homogeneously catalysed oligomerisation reactions of 1,3-dienes offer a convenient route to specifically functionalised polyolefins which may otherwise pose synthetic difficulties. For example, the telomerisation of butadiene and acetic acid in the presence of a palladium catalyst provides the Cg building blocks l-acetoxy-2,7-octadiene and 3-acetoxy-l,7-octadiene which have proved their value as starting materials in a number of natural product syntheses [I], and the rhodium-catalysed codimerisation of such 1-substituted 2,7-octadienes with 1,3-dienes allows easy access to non- conjugated linear dodecatriene derivatives [2]. *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. \" \"Present address: School of Chemical Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich NR4 7TJ, U.K. 0304-5102/84/$3.00 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 80 Whereas in palladium and nickel catalysed diene reactions product distribution and catalytic activity are controlled by the concentration and nature of donor molecules such as phosphines and phosphites [3], our inves- tigations of the rhodium catalysed system have revealed that very different types of promoters are active, i.e. organic chlorides with labile C C1 bonds [4], hydrogen and, surprisingly, chromium(III) chloride. These can act in a co-operative manner. The present study describes the effects of promoters and poisons on the activity and selectivity of the rhodium catalyst. Results and discussion The unpromoted reaction l-Acetoxy-2,7-octadiene (1) reacts with excess 1,3-butadiene in the presence of catalytic amounts of RhC^-nH^O (usually 0.01 to 1 mol %) in ethanol under autogenous pressure to give a mixture of linear and branched Ci2 products 2, 3 and 4 (Fig. 1) [2]. -OAc + ^ ^^ ^ 1 'OAc * ^-\\^\\^V\\0*. * - - - -.T -OAC Fig. 1. Codimerisation of l-acetoxy-2,7-octadiene with butadiene. The ratio of linear to branched isomers [referred to as the n/iso ratio, 2: (3 + 4)] is usually ca. 1.4:1. At high conversions of 1 and prolonged reac- tion times Gig by-products are formed, mostly at the expense of 3 and 4, so that the relative amount of 2 increases. There is some evidence as to the nature of the catalyst. It is known [5] that rhodium trichloride and butadiene in refluxing ethanol form the crotyl complex 5 as an orange crystalline solid. Stoichiometric amounts of 1 react with 5 under mild conditions to give C^ products, and toluene solutions of 5 can be used instead of RhClg/ethanol as catalyst precursors with similar results. It is most likely therefore that Rh(III)-crotyl complexes are involved 81 in the catalytic cycle; the structures of 2, 3 and 4 can then be explained as the products of a metal-catalysed crotyl group transfer to the double bonds ofl. Cramer has suggested a mechanism based on similar intermediates for the codimerisation of butadiene with ethylene (to give 1,4-hexadiene) and also reported the isolation of complex 5 from that reaction [6]. However, whereas the ethylene-butadiene codimerisation proceeds smoothly, the rate of reaction of butadiene with terminal mono-olefins H2C=CHR decreases with increasing length of R, and with 1-octene only traces of Ci2 products are found. This behaviour contrasts with the high conversion rates observed if, at some distance from the C=C bond, the mono-olefin carries a functional group capable of coordinating to the metal centre. For functionalised Cg olefins the reactivity increases in the order 3-acetoxy-l,7-octadiene 1- acetoxy-7-octene < 1, an indication that the ability of a substrate like 1 to form a rhodium chelate of a certain ring size is crucial for a fast reaction. This assumption is supported by the fact that butenyl transfer onto 1 occurs regiospecifically at C-2 and C-8; products from attack on C-3 and C-7 have not been identified. Since a rhodium chelate ring will adopt a conformation in which strain and steric repulsion with the crotyl ligand are minimised, this regiospecificity is explained as the consequence of such conformational preference. It is not observed with substrates which form larger and less rigid chelates, such as l-acetoxy-7-octene, and in this case both products from butenyl transfer to the terminal C=C double bond are formed in equal amounts. A mechanism based on these observations is outlined in Fig. 2. The n/iso ratio Donor ligands such as phosphines, phosphites and amines strongly reduce the activity of the catalyst, and also influence the n/iso ratio to a certain extent, as do less basic additives such as maleic anhydride (Table 1). Variations of the terminal substituents in 2,7-octadienes lead to characteris- tic changes in the n/iso ratio, with octadienyl carboxylates forming mainly linear, Cg alcohols and ethers predominantly branched products (Table 2). Most of the reactions require relatively high catalyst concentrations (0.3 - 0.5 mol % Rh). The reactivity of the octadienes CgH^X decreases in the 82 AcO\" Fig. 2. Proposed mechanism for the codimerisation of 1 with butadiene (A) and the catalyst regeneration by organic chlorides (B).

Organic halide promoters In the codimerisation of butadiene with 1 the unmodified and unpro- moted catalyst converts 300 - 500 mol 1 per g atom Rh per hour. We found that addition of ally lie halides, especially cinnamyi chloride and crotyl chloride, and acyi halides improve the catalyst activity by a factor of up to 83 TABLE 2 The codimerisation of butadiene with 1-substituted 2,7-octadienes, C8Hl3Xa X Reaction Conversion Selectivity to n/iso time (h) of CgHisX Cu products ratio MeCOO 2 93 80 1.4 EtCOO 2 96 85 1.8 IVCOO 3 91 76 1.9 B^COO 3 86 73 1.6 OPh 3 96 0.9 OCHiCHaOH 2 57 0.5 OH 3 70 0.5 NMei.HCl 3 co. 20 0.6 NEt2 HC1 3 ca. 20 17.0 \"Reaction conditions: RhCl3 (0.1 mmol) in 0.5 ml ethanol; butadiene:CgHi3X:Rh = 700:200 - 300:1 (in case of X= NRi-HCl, 300:100:1). Temperature, 110 C. 20 [4]. Benzyl chloride and saturated alkyi chlorides such as isopropyi chloride and carbon tetrachloride are ineffective. A possible mechanism for the catalyst activation by organic halides is outlined in Fig. 2. The active Rh(III) catalyst is susceptible to reductive elim- ination of HC1 during certain stages of the catalytic cycle. The tendency of Rh(III) complexes such as 5 to give Rh(I) compounds in the presence of chelating olefins is demonstrated by the facile evolution of HC1 gas on reacting 5 with 1 at ambient temperature and pressure. In the absence of organic halides, such Rh(I) complexes are catalytically inactive. Although it was not possible to isolate Rh(I) complexes from experiments carried out under catalytic conditions, the reduction of Rh(III) is seen as a major factor in catalyst deactivation. All the organic activators used in this system have labile C C1 bonds and are of a type able to undergo oxidative addition reac- tions with low-valent metal complexes (cf. the synthesis of 5 from butenyl chloride and ^H^RhCl [5]). It is therefore plausible that catalyst acti- vation consists of oxidative addition of R C1 to Rh(I), followed by transfer of the organic moiety R to an olefinic ligand; subsequent jS-elimination generates a Rh(III) species (formulated as HRhCl^) which re-enters the catalytic cycle (Fig. 2, cycle B). Activation by chromium(III) chloride Solid [Cr(H20)4Cl2]Cl-2H20 (commercial 'CrCla-GHzO') was unex- pectedly found to be an important promoter in the codimerisation reaction, although it is virtually insoluble in the reaction mixture and the system becomes heterogeneous. Under catalytic conditions no reaction could be detected between the hydrocarbon-soluble rhodium complex and the chromium chloride additive. Metallic chromium is also effective, provided organic halide is present with which it forms chromium trichloride under 84 the reaction conditions. However, chromium coordinated to oxygen donor ligands, e.g. Cr(acac)3 or KCr(SC>4)2'12H20, impedes the reaction, as does Cr(CO)6. Anhydrous sublimed CrCl3 has no effect because of its insolubility. The promoter effect by hydrated chromium trichloride contrasts with the deactivating effect of ionic chlorides, e.g. NMe4+Cl- (Table 3). The function of chromium is not understood; it cannot be fulfilled by any other common metal or metal halide.

Selectivity to [2 + 3 + 4], >98%. Co-operative catalyst activation Hydrogen gas (usually applied at 10 bar pressure*) exerts a co- promoting effect. Although it can oxidatively add to certain transition metal complexes, it has no activating influence by itself, but it greatly improves the conversion of 1 in the presence of organic halides and/or CrC^-SH^O. Hydrogen consumption or formation of hydrogenated products has not been observed. The best results are obtained with a combination of all three types of activators (Fig. 3). At a rhodium level of 20 ppm the highest observed turn- over numbers correspond to the production of ca. 45 kg Ci; acetate per g Rh per hour. The catalyst activity has been measured as a function of the concentra- tions of cinnamyi chloride (as an example for organic halide activators) and of CrC^ GH^O in the presence and absence of cinnamyi chloride (Figs. 4 and 5). Good conversion rates are achieved at a Cr:Rh ratio of ca. 200:1 and at a cinnamyi chloride :Rh ratio of ca. 5000:1; further increases do'not lead to a corresponding improvement in turnover and may even be counter productive. *1 bar = 1.013 X 105 Pa. 85 i 10- Additives Fig. 3.

Catalyst deactivation Apart from the poisoning effect by phosphorus and nitrogen donor molecules mentioned above, the reaction is also retarded by larger quantities of water and ethanol. Molecular nitrogen as 'inert atmosphere' has an unexpected effect: N3 at moderate pressure (7 -10 bar) blocks the reaction completely. Since rhodium(I) forms stable complexes with chelating dienes RCH= CH CHa CH^ CH^CHR (e.g. cyclo-octadiene) [7], catalyst deactivation by the structurally related products 2 and 3 can be expected. The formation of an active catalyst is inhibited when these dodecatrienyl acetates are added to the reactants before the start of a run. At sufficiently high levels they compensate completely the effect of activators like allyl chloride, and the conversion rate is that of an activator-free reaction (Fig. 6). Experimental GLC analyses were carried out with a Pye Unicam GCD gas chromato- graph using a 5 ft glass column of 15% Apiezon L on Chromosorb WAW. Other instruments used were Perkin-Elmer 577 (IR), Jeol 100 (NMR), VG 7070 (MS). Butadiene was redistilled and passed through activated alumina prior to use, other reagents were used as supplied.

Buta- diene (200 ml, 2.3 mol) was condensed into a glass-lined 1 1 autoclave at -20 C. Pd(OAc)2 (1.0 g, 4.45 mmol), LiOAc-2H^O (4.0 g, 39 mmol), tris(o- tolyl) phosphite (1.4 g, 4 mmol) and finally glacial acetic acid (60 g, 1 mol) were added and reacted under autogeneous pressure or 10 bar N2 at 45 C for 1 h. Excess butadiene was vented off, the remainder washed with water, neutralised with sodium carbonate, and the catalyst poisoned by adding 1 g NaCN. Drying over Na2SO>4 gave the crude product (145 g) consisting of 85% 1 and 15% 3-acetoxy-l,7-octadiene which was removed by fractional distilla- tion at 70 - 90 C/0.1 torr. Compound 1 was obtained at 90 -120 C/0.1 torr in 95% purity. Saponification (NaOH in methanol) gave 2,7-octadien-l-ol. Other car- boxylates were obtained similarly. l-(2'-Hydroxyethoxy)-2,7-octadiene was prepared using a Pd(OAc)2/ PPh3 catalyst and a two-fold excess of ethylene glycol. l-Diethylamino-2,7- octadiene is best made using the mixture Pd^Ac^/PPhs/CFaCOOH^Hg/ HNEtz in the ratio 1:1:4:800:400 at 70 C. 88 Codimerisation of 1 with butadiene A typical procedure involved charging the glass liner of a 100 ml auto- clave with 1 (16.59 g, 98.8 mmol), n-dodecane as internal GLC standard (1.599 g), cinnarnyl chloride (2.52 g, 16.5 mmol), CrC^^Hp (2.0 g, 7.5 mmol) and 0.2 ml of a 0.005 M toluene solution of 5 (0.002 mg atom Rh). Butadiene (18 ml, 200 mmol) was added at 20 C and the reaction carried out in an autoclave under 10 bar H; at 120 C/2 h with magnetic stirring. The conversion of 1 was 85%, the selectivity to 2, 3 and 4 being 97% (GLC). The products were isolated after poisoning the catalyst with PPh3 or aqueous NaCN by fractional distillation (130 -180 C/0.01 torr). Semi-preparative GLC allowed the isolation of pure 2, but 3 and 4 could not be separated completely. The spectroscopic data were identical to those reported [2]. References 1 J. Tsuji, Pure Appl.
