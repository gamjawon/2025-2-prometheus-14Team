Restricting the Pd sintering during aging is crucial for the three-way catalysts (TWCs). Herein, following the Ostwald-ripening mechanism, Pd sintering in the commercial TWCs was greatly suppressed by increasing the initial size of the Pd NPs, through a pre-precipitation method. Our catalysts showed initially larger Pd NPs after calcination at 550 ℃ (3.3 vs. 1.8 nm) while smaller ones after aging at 1000 ℃ (35.0 vs. 70.1 nm) than the counterpart made by impregnation. The optimal aged catalyst showed much better performance than the counterpart: T50 was decreased by 40, 13 and 14 ℃ for CO, NO and C3H6 over the powder samples, and a higher oxygen storage capacity was observed (248 > 178 mg/L) over the monolith converters. The decreased size of the Pd NPs and the improved reducibility as well as the more concentrated adsorbed oxygen species for the optimal aged catalyst were responsible for the improved performance. Graphical Abstract ga1 Keywords Three-way catalyst Pre-precipitation Anti-sintering Monolith converter Ostwald ripening Data Availability Data will be made available on request. 1 Introduction The three-way catalysts (TWCs), which can simultaneously eliminate CO, NO and hydrocarbons in the gasoline engine exhaust, usually contain the high-cost Pd as the main active species as well as Rh and Pt [1–3]. The high temperature and high humidity working condition for the TWCs usually leads to the severe sintering of the Pd nanoparticles (NPs) after long-term service, which has been regarded as the major cause for the deactivation of TWCs [4]. Thus, the anti-sintering ability is crucial for the commercial TWCs. The impregnation method has been widely adopted in industry to introduce Pd into the TWCs. However, the as-prepared finely dispersed Pd with rather a small size (e.g., < 10 nm) after calcination at 500 ℃ could easily sinter upon aging at high temperatures around 900 ℃ [5]. So, diverse anti-sintering strategies have been proposed, e.g., using MgAl2O4 to stabilize the supported Ir or Rh via the strong metal-support interaction [6], adopting the flame spray pyrolysis method to obtain the Pd-Al2O3 or Pd-CeO2 [7,8], doping Pd into the lattice of CeO2 [9], or nano-confinement of Pd particles by a porous rigid layer like SiO2 [10]. Moreover, adjusting the support morphology [11], optimizing the Pd precursor [12], restricting the loading of Pd on Al2O3 with electron donor sites [13,14], reducing via in situ steam reforming of exhaust hydrocarbons [15], alloying with Rh [16], and treating with water vapor [17], have also been reported to promote the thermal stability and/or increase the activity of the aged Pd. Despite these progresses by using deliberate strategies, the facile and scalable methods are still needed to restrict the sintering of Pd NPs for industrial application. The growth in the size of the Pd crystallites in TWCs has been widely reported to follow the Ostwald-ripening mechanism [5,18], where the metal atoms would be detached from a smaller crystallite then captured by a larger one. The Ostwald-ripening mechanism is mainly based on the Ostwald-Freundlich equation (Eq1), describing the chemical potential of a metal crystallite in diameter D: μ/μeq = exp(4γ•Vatom/(kB•T•D)) (Eq1). or the differential form: -d(μ/μeq)/dD = exp(4γ•Vatom/(kB•T•D))(4γ•Vatom/(kB•T))/D2 (Eq2). where μ is the chemical potential, μeq is the μ in equilibrium with the bulk metal (D = ∞), γ is the surface tension, Vatom is the volume of the metal atom, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature. From Eq1, one can see that the difference of the chemical potential among the particles with various sizes would induce the diffusion of metal atoms from smaller particles to larger ones, which is a strong driving force for the Ostwald-ripening of the particles. According to Eq2, the negative gradient of the chemical potential (-d(μ/μeq)/dD), representing the driving force, decreases as the crystallites size (D) increases if the surface tension (γ) is set to be a constant, not to mention that the γ value would actually decrease as the Pd diameter rises [5]. Therefore, when comparing two samples with different average sizes of the Pd NPs while similar particle size distribution width, the sample with a larger average size would exhibit a less severe tendency to sinter. Thus, the anti-sintering ability of Pd could be enhanced by moderately increasing the initial size of the Pd NPs. Generally, control of the size of Pd NPs was realized by tuning either the loading of Pd or the temperature/atmosphere of the thermal treatments [5]. However, there have been few reports that introduced the facile control of the size of the Pd particles with the fixed Pd loading and thermal treatment. In present work, the anti-sintering property was enhanced by moderately increasing the initial size of the Pd NPs (obtained after calcination at 550 °C), realized by a facile pre-precipitation method, where the Pd precursor was pre-precipitated before being loaded onto the substrates. Since the composition of the support could also influence the Ostwald ripening kinetics [19], the support as well as the additives (La2O3-doped γ-Al2O3/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2/BaSO4) was fixed for our catalysts, which was also referring to the industrial application scenario. In brief, the stable La2O3-doped γ-Al2O3 support with a high surface area was for the dispersion of Pd [20], the additive of Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 was to compensate for the oscillation in the exhaust oxygen concentration [2], and the BaSO4 was to stabilize PdO [21]. Moreover, the alkali (tetraethyl ammonium hydroxide, TEAOH) was exactly that used for the commercial TWCs. TEAOH, with a low boiling point of 110 ℃, has no ash content and can decompose below 500 ℃ [22]; besides, it can relieve the harmful complexation with Pd2+ as compared to the ammonia water [23,24]. After being aged at 1000 ℃, the catalyst obtained by the pre-precipitation method showed much better catalytic performances for the three-way catalytic reactions than the corresponding system synthesized by the impregnation method. Multiple measurements were conducted to compare the size of the Pd NPs and to investigate its influence on the various physicochemical properties and the catalytic performances. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials preparation The alkali agent, tetraethyl ammonium hydroxide (TEAOH), was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co Ltd., and was diluted with deionized (DI) water to 11.5 wt% before use. Pd(NO3)2 aqueous solution, containing 15.38 wt% of Pd, was provided by Sino-Platinum Metals Co., Ltd. The commercial mixed oxides support and additives ((10 wt% La2O3-doped γ-Al2O3)/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2/BaSO4 = 46/44/10 in mass ratio) were provided by Kunming Sino-platinum Metals Catalyst Co Ltd. For simplicity, the 10 wt% La2O3-doped γ-Al2O3 was denoted as Al2O3. The cylindrical cordierite monolith substrate (diameter = 118.4 mm, length = 69 mm, 750 cells per square inch, wall thickness = 2 milli-inch, volume = 0.759 L) was obtained from NGK INSULATORS, LTD. Typically, 0.26 g of the Pd precursor, containing 0.04 g of Pd, was diluted to 6.7 g with DI water. Then, 1.0, 0.5 or 0 g (corresponding to PP-1.0, PP-0.5, or Imp, respectively) of the diluted TEAOH aqueous solution was added dropwise into the Pd precursor under stirring. After 21 h of stirring, 3.96 g of mixed oxides support and additives were slowly added into the above mixture. To realize a thorough mixing, repeated sonication and stirring every 30 min were conducted for 3 h in total. After drying at 120 ℃ under stirring, the powder was grinded, then calcined at 550 ℃ for 3 h in static air to obtain the calcined samples (denoted as “XX-550″), finally aged at 1000 ℃ for 4 h in 2% O2/10% H2O/N2 (200 mL/min) to get the aged samples (denoted as “XX-1000″). Monolith converters: The “PP-0.5″ procedure (before the step of drying) was selected to prepare the slurry, which was then suck-coated onto a cylindrical cordierite monolith substrate. Afterwards, the obtained monolith (“brick”) experienced drying, calcination and aging, the same as those for the powder samples shown above. The washcoat loading (solid) was 200 g/L, with the corresponding Pd loading of 2 g/L. A cylindrical “core” sample (diameter = 26.5 mm, length = 69 mm, volume = 38 cm3) was then cut from the “brick” center (after calcination or aging) to measure the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and the catalytic activity. For comparison, the “brick” and “core” samples were also prepared following the “Imp” procedure. 2.2 Characterizations X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Rigaku D/Max 2500/PC diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (40 kV and 200 mA), with a step size of 0.02 degree and a scan rate of 5 degree per minute. (In situ) Raman spectra were recorded on a HORIBA LabRAM HR 800 Raman microscope with a 633 nm excitation length. When collecting the in situ Raman spectra, a gas mixture of 1000 ppm CO + 1000 ppm C3H6 + 500 ppm NO + 4750 ppm O2 + 8% H2O + 8% CO2 + balance N2, 60 mL/min in total, was fed into the sample cell that was heated from room temperature (RT) with a ramp rate of 10 ℃/min. The N2 adsorption/desorption (ads/des) curves were recorded using Quadrasorb Station 1 at − 196 °C, with the samples being pre-treated under vacuum at 110 ℃ for 1 h, then heated to 300 ℃ and kept for 3 h. Pd content was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) on a Perkin-Elmer 7300DV instrument. Pd dispersion was measured by the CO-pulse chemisorption method on a Micromeritics AutoChem Ⅱ 2920 instrument. The samples were firstly reduced in 10% H2/Ar (30 mL/min) at 200 ℃ for 1 h, then flushed by He (30 mL/min) for 20 min. After cooling down to 50 ℃, pulse chemisorption was conducted under a He flow (30 mL/min) and pulses of 0.52 mL of 5% CO/He. In order to calculate the metal dispersion, an adsorption stoichiometry of Pd/CO = 2 was assumed [25], since the bridged CO adsorption mode usually predominates on Pd nanoparticles [26,27]. The effect of CO adsorption on the bare support and additives without Pd, has been excluded by experiment. Transmission electron microscope-energy dispersive spectroscopy (TEM-EDS) elemental mapping images were collected on a JEM-2100 F instrument. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were obtained on a Quanta 200 instrument. CO temperature-programmed reduction (CO-TPR) was performed on a Micromeritics AutoChem Ⅱ 2920 instrument. 50 mg of sample was pre-heated at 110 ℃ in pure He flow (10 mL/min) for 30 min to remove moisture; then after cooling in He, the sample was heated from RT to 900 ℃ at 20 ℃/min in 5% CO/He (10 mL/min), with the signal recorded with a Balzers Instruments OmniStar™ mass spectrometer (MS). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were collected on a Thermofisher Excalab X + instrument. C 1 s line at 284.8 eV was used to calibrate the binding energies. 2.3 Activity test 2.3.1 CO oxidation: CO oxidation test was conducted as a probe reaction Typically, 0.05 g of catalyst (sieved below 150 µm of grain size) was loaded into a U-shaped quartz reactor (i.d. = 8 mm) with compressed quartz wool to support the mixture. A thermocouple that is sealed in a slim quartz tube was placed inside the reactor, ~5 mm to the catalyst bed, to measure the temperature without contact with the reaction atmosphere. A gas mixture of 0.1% CO + 0.1% O2 + 8% H2O + balance N2 (total flow = 150 mL/min) was then introduced, giving a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 180,000 mL/gcat/h. For the introduction of water vapor, the gas mixture was passed through a water bath kept at 42 ℃. Gas concentrations were monitored every second by a Balzers Instruments OmniStar™ mass spectrometer. After stabilizing for 30 min, the reactor was heated from RT to 400 ℃ with a ramp rate of 10 ℃/min. Next, the furnace was cooled down to RT, with the reaction gas keeping flowing, then a 2nd test run was conducted under the same conditions described above. 2.3.2 Three-way catalytic reactions Typically, 0.25 g of catalyst (40–60 mesh) was mixed with 2.5 g of quartz SiO2 (40–60 mesh), then loaded into a linear quartz reactor (i.d. = 8 mm). A gas mixture of 1000 ppm CO + 1000 ppm C3H6 + 500 ppm NO + 4750 ppm O2 + 8% H2O + 8% CO2 + balance N2 (1250 mL/min in total, GHSV = 300,000 mL/gcat/h) was then introduced. Only N2 gas was passed through the water bath that was kept at 42 ℃, thus to avoid dissolution of the reaction gases, especially CO2. The O2 concentration was controlled to realize a stoichiometric combustion condition (the relative air to fuel ratio, λ, equals to 1). After stabilizing for 30 min, the reactor was heated from RT to 500 ℃ with a ramp rate of 10 ℃/min. Next, the furnace was cooled down to RT, with the reaction gas keeping flowing, then a 2nd test run was conducted under the same conditions described above. Gas concentrations were monitored every second by an infrared gas sensor (MultiGas™ 2030 FT-IR Continuous Gas Analyzer). 2.3.3 Dynamic OSC test and three-way catalytic reactions over monolith samples The cylindrical core sample (volume = 38 cm3) was fixed tightly in a quartz tube reactor in a bench-scale catalytic reactor system. Dynamic OSC values were firstly measured at 500 ℃ following a standard test procedure [28], with the gas stream periodically switching between the lean (λlean = 1.02) and rich (λrich = 0.98) conditions (see the detailed gas compositions in Table S1). The value of λ is defined as the ratio of “real air/fuel ratio” over “ideal air/fuel ratio”; a λ higher than 1 indicates a condition with excess air or lean fuel, while a λ lower than 1 indicates deficient air or rich fuel. The time between lean and rich gas streams was 50 s, and the gas flow was adjusted to ensure a GHSV of 60,000 /h. After the OSC test, the core sample was cooled to RT. Next, the sample was heated to 500 ℃ (10 ℃/min, GHSV = 60,000 /h) in the gas flow of 1000 ppm CO + 1000 ppm C3H6 + 500 ppm NO + 4750 ppm O2 + 8% H2O + 8% CO2 + balance N2. Gas concentrations were monitored every second by an infrared gas sensor (MultiGas™ 2030 FT-IR Continuous Gas Analyzer). 3 Results and discussions 3.1 Structural properties Structural properties of the catalysts were measured by the XRD ( Fig. 1A). The three components, γ-Al2O3, Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 and BaSO4, especially Ce0.5Zr0.5O2, were identified for all the samples before or after aging, while no Pd-containing phase could be observed, probably due to the high Pd dispersion, poor crystallinity of the Pd species in the calcined samples, or the interference from the complex compositions. After aging, the crystalline grain size of the main Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 phase grew obviously, correspondingly, the specific surface area and pore volume decreased sharply for each calcined sample ( Table 1). The Raman spectroscopy exhibits a smaller detection depth than the XRD, thus can reflect information about the subsurface/surface properties. In the Raman spectra in Fig. 1B, the aged samples showed a more intense peak around 648 cm−1 than the calcined counterparts, which could be due to the higher crystallinity of PdO (the B1 g mode [29,30]) in the aged samples. The peaks at 460 and 988 cm−1 could be observed for all the calcined and aged samples, and were due to the CeO2-based oxides (F2 g mode) [31] and BaSO4 (ν1 mode) [32] respectively. Besides, the peak at 282 cm−1, due to the tetragonal ZrO2 (A1 g mode) [33], appeared over the aged samples instead of the calcined ones, indicating the structural evolution of Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 upon aging. The structural evolution should be rather moderate or occurred only on the surface of the sample, since it could only be detected by the Raman spectroscopy instead of the XRD (Fig. 1A). As listed in Table 1, the more alkali (TEAOH) adopted, the lower Pd dispersion in the calcined samples. Among them, Imp-550 showed the highest Pd dispersion (62.4%), followed by PP-0.5–550 (34.2%), then PP-1.0–550 (6.2%). After aging, the Pd dispersion dropped for all. Thereinto, the dispersion of Pd of PP-0.5–1000 (3.2%) and PP-1.0–1000 (3.0%) turned to be higher than that of Imp-1000 (1.6%). The loss of Pd dispersion after aging could be due to the Pd sintering as well as the migration of Pd to the near-surface layers of the supports. Besides the CO pulse-chemisorption, the TEM-EDS measurement was also adopted to estimate the size of the sintered Pd NPs in the aged samples, which showed a much clearer boundary than the Pd NPs in the fresh samples (Fig. S2), thus offering a reliable accuracy in measurement. Similar to the CO pulse-chemisorption results, the TEM-EDS mapping also confirmed that Imp-1000 possessed larger Pd NPs than those of the PP-1.0–1000 (Fig. S3). From the CO pulse-chemisorption results, the calcined Imp-550 showed smaller Pd NPs than the PP-1.0–550, which was also reflected by the more dispersed Pd in Imp-550 by TEM-EDS mapping (Fig. S4). Thus, the larger Pd NPs in the initial calcined PP-0.5–550 and PP-1.0–550 showed stronger sintering-resistance than the Imp-550 counterpart. According to the aforementioned Ostwald-Freundlich equation, the greatly decreased gradient of the chemical potential at larger Pd NPs had led to the slower sintering kinetics. Note that the Ostwald-Freundlich equation could explain the observed phenomenon only from the perspective of thermodynamics; when also taking into account the chemical kinetics of the sintering process of Pd, the Pd NPs with a starting size of D could probably exhibit different growth rate as compared to the Pd NPs with a transient size of D that was derived from a smaller one (d), probably due to the different transient concentration of Pd monomer around the Pd NPs. Secondly, the interface between the support and the Pd NPs with a starting size of D may be different from that between the support and the Pd NPs with a transient size of D that was derived from a smaller one (d), thus leading to the different growth kinetics of Pd NPs. Influence of the residual precipitant TEAOH could be excluded, since it shows a low boiling point of 110 ℃, can be readily rinsed and decompose below 400 ℃ (or below 500 ℃ for the TEA+ ion) [22]. 3.2 Catalytic performance for the simple CO oxidation As a simple probe reaction, CO oxidation was firstly conducted to compare the stability in the catalytic activity against aging ( Fig. 2a). The activity of the calcined samples decreased in the order of PP-0.5–550 > Imp-550 > PP-1.0–550, with T10 and T50 (the temperature where the conversion reaches 10% and 50%, respectively) increasing as follows 95 < 114 < 150 ℃ and 143 < 165 < 200 ℃. The worst activity of PP-1.0–550 was mainly due to the much larger size of Pd NPs than those in the other two samples resulting from the over-high usage of TEAOH to pre-precipitate the Pd precursor. After aging, the activity decreased in a different order of PP-0.5–1000 ~ PP-1.0–1000 > Imp-1000, with T10 and T50 increasing as follows 180 ~ 182 < 208 ℃ and 198 ~ 202 < 230 ℃. As summarized in Fig. 2b, the increase of T10 and T50 from the calcined to the aged samples was much higher for the Imp sample than those for the PP-0.5 and PP-1.0, demonstrating the anti-deactivation advantage of the pre-precipitation method over the impregnation. Even after using, the spent PP-0.5 and PP-1.0 catalysts still showed higher stability in the catalytic activity against aging than the spent “Imp” catalysts (Fig. S5). Moreover, the increase in T10 and T50 upon aging showed a positive relationship with that of the Pd particle sizes (Fig. 2b), which is because the sintering of Pd would lead to the sharp decrease in the number of available active sites [4]. Among the PP-1.0, PP-0.5 and Imp samples, the PP-0.5 showed the highest overall catalytic activity for the probe CO oxidation, after being calcined or aged. To focus on the suppression of deactivation in the aged TWCs, the aged PP-0.5–1000 was tested for the three-way catalytic performance, and compared with the aged reference Imp-1000. 3.3 Catalytic performance for the three-way catalytic reactions For the three-way catalytic reactions, CO, NO and C3H6, as well as CO2, H2O were introduced to simulate the gasoline engine exhaust. As expected, the PP-0.5–1000 showed higher catalytic activity than the Imp-1000. In detail, as shown in Fig. 3a, the T10 values for the removal of CO, NO and C3H6 over the PP-0.5–1000 were 32, 8 and 7 ℃ lower than those over the Imp-1000. Similarly, the T50 values over the PP-0.5–1000 were also decreased by 40, 13 and 14 ℃, respectively, compared with those for the Imp-1000, as shown in Fig. 3b. The higher catalytic activity of the PP-0.5–1000 than the Imp-1000 could be due to the smaller size of the Pd species, benefiting from the anti-sintering ability of the pre-precipitation method. An interesting phenomenon was observed that the CO, NO and C3H6 conversion curves showed kinks in the identical temperature range, over either Imp-1000 (Fig. 3c) or PP-0.5–1000 (Fig. 3d). Specifically, when the temperature rose, the conversion of CO, NO or C3H6 over the Imp-1000 (PP-0.5–1000) sample firstly increased then decreased sharply at 273 (270) ℃ until 296 (289) ℃ where the conversion started to increased again. Such a phenomenon could be ascribed to the switch from the PdO to metallic Pd [34]. The Raman spectroscopy is more sensitive to the PdO than the XRD. Also, the PdO is Raman-active while the metallic Pd is not [29,30]. So, the in situ Raman spectra were collected for the Imp-1000 and PP-0.5–1000, as shown in Fig. 3e and f. The gradually weakened peak centered at 648 cm−1 (due to the crystalline PdO) under the reaction conditions, just indicated the reduction of PdO. The peak disappeared at lower temperatures (176 or 170 ℃) than those where the kinks started to appear (273 or 270 ℃). There were multiple factors that could result in the difference in these temperatures. Firstly, the in situ Raman test could not perfectly resemble the conditions for the activity test, in terms of space velocity, heating rate and temperature probing. Secondly, the Raman spectroscopy may be more sensitive to the crystallinity of PdO than the activity test, in other words, the amorphous PdO was Raman-inactive [30] but could still be of high catalytic activity [35]. Thirdly, the metallic Pd layer, resulting from the reduction of PdO by H2 (produced via the steam reforming and water-gas shift reactions [36] during the complex three-way catalytic reactions), could cover the remaining PdO and screen the Raman laser [30]. These metallic Pd species would be re-oxidized back into PdO, upon cooling in the reaction atmosphere, especially at the presence of CeO2-based oxides [37]. So, the kinks, though weakened, could re-appear during the 2nd test run (Fig. S6), where the PP-0.5–1000 could still show the enhanced catalytic activity compared to the Imp-1000. Moreover, consecutive test runs (from 200 to 850 ℃) showed that the catalytic activity gradually improved with increasing test run over the Imp-1000 and PP-0.5–1000 (Fig. S7), indicating the possible re-dispersion of Pd that has been widely reported in literature [38–44]. In Figs. 3c and 3d, the CO conversion firstly increased faster than the C3H6 conversion, while, after the kinks appeared, the C3H6 conversion turned to surpass the CO conversion. This should be due to the phase change from PdO to Pd. The dynamic and unstable Pd/PdO mixed phases seemed to work less effectively for the CO elimination than the C3H6 elimination. 3.4 Monolith coverters for the three-way catalytic reactions To further test the validity of the pre-precipitation method, the monolith converter (shown in Fig. 4a) based on the PP-0.5–1000 procedure was prepared and compared with that made by impregnation. The T10 (or T50) values for CO, NO and C3H6 elimination over the PP-0.5–1000 converter were 7, 13 and 10 ℃ (or 14, 17 and 14 ℃) lower than those over the “Imp-1000″, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4b (or Fig. 4c). More importantly, the OSC values of the PP-0.5–1000 converter surpassed that of the “Imp-1000″ by a large margin (248 > 178 mg/L, Fig. 4d). In the industrial application of TWCs, where the oxygen concentration in the exhaust often fluctuates, the TWC with a higher OSC value could more effectively eliminate CO, NO and C3H6 by readily stabilizing the oxygen concentration. In that case, the PP-0.5–1000 converter would exhibit a greater advantage over the “Imp-1000″ in terms of the light-off activity. So, the pre-precipitation method could endow the aged TWCs with improved catalytic performance, as compared to the traditional impregnation. 3.5 Reducibility To further understand the difference of the redox properties between the samples obtained by the pre-precipitation and the impregnation, the CO-TPR measurement was conducted. Fig. 5 shows the CO-TPR curves of the Imp-1000 and PP-0.5–1000 as well as their calcined counterparts. For the reduction peaks centered at 133–187 ℃, which were due to the PdO x species [45,46], it could be found that the PdO x species showed weaker reducibility over the calcined PP-0.5–550 (146 ℃) than that over the Imp-550 (133 ℃); however, after aging, the PdO x on the PP-0.5–1000 (187 ℃) exhibited comparable reducibility to that on the Imp-1000 (186 ℃). Similarly, for the reduction peaks due to the surface Ce4+ [47,48], the one at 305 ℃ for the PP-0.5–550 moved moderately to 381 ℃ after aging, while the one at 277 ℃ for the Imp-550 moved to around 515 ℃. The higher anti-aging ability of the reducibility of the surface Ce4+ on the PP-0.5–550 than that on the Imp-550 should be due to the hindered growth of the size of the Pd NPs on the PP-0.5–550, since the reduction of the surface Ce4+ could be facilitated by the spillover of CO over Pd [49]. Overall, the enhanced reducibility would contribute to the improved catalytic activity for the PP-0.5–1000 as compared to the Imp-1000, towards the simple CO oxidation (Figure 2, T10: 180 vs. 208 ℃, T50: 198 vs. 230 ℃) and the complex three-way catalytic reactions (see details in Fig. 3). Assignment of the other peaks could be found in the supporting information (Fig. S9 and the related discussion). 3.6 XPS study Table. 2 To get an insight into the surface properties of the Imp-1000 and PP-0.5–1000, XPS study was conducted. The calcined Imp-550 and PP-0.5–550 were also tested for reference. Among the studied samples, the smaller size of the Pd NPs, the lower Pd2+ content (Fig. 7a), just contrary to the trend for the Pd4+ content (Fig. S11). The closer interaction between Pd and ceria-based oxides derived from the smaller size of the Pd NPs in the PP-0.5–1000 than that in the Imp-1000, would facilitate the electron transfer from Pd to Ce, thus resulting in the decreased Pd2+ while increased Pd4+ [52]. The ratios of Ce3+/Cetotal and (Oα +Oβ)/Ototal were estimated based on the peak area ratio of A(u′ + v′)/Atotal ( Fig. 6B, Table S4) and A(Oα+Oβ)/Atotal (Fig. 6C, Table S5), respectively. Both ratios roughly decreased with increasing size of the Pd NPs ( Figs. 7b, c). Though the PP-0.5–550 showed lower ratios of Ce3+/Cetotal and (Oα+Oβ)/Ototal than the Imp-550, the aged PP-0.5–1000 exhibited comparable even higher ratios as compared to the Imp-1000, benefiting from the hindered Pd sintering in the PP-0.5–1000. Additionally, the Ba 3d and S 2p XPS spectra were also collected and compared between the PP-0.5–550 and PP-0.5–1000 (Fig. S12). It could be found that the Ba 3d5/2 peak was more positive in binding energy for the PP-0.5–550 than that for the PP-0.5–1000. A similar trend could also be found for the S 2p XPS spectra. One possible explanation was offered as follows, as a alkali earth metal, Ba shows the propensity to donate electron to Ce or Pd (due to the lower electronegativity of Ba), while after aging, the interface between BaSO4 and the other components could decrease, making it less possible for Ba to loss electron, finally, more electron was retained in BaSO4. It is generally believed that a high concentration of Ce3+ or adsorbed oxygen species (reflecting the highly concentrated oxygen vacancies [54,55]) is beneficial for the reduction-oxidation reactions, since the oxygen vacancies could benefit the activation of oxygen molecules [55], and facilitate the oxygen storage and release in the ceria-based oxides. The PP-0.5–550 possessed a lower Ce3+/Cetotal ratio (0.40 vs. 0.54, Fig. 7b) and a lower (Oα +Oβ)/Ototal value (0.76 vs. 0.83, Fig. 7c) as well as a lower Pd dispersion (34.2% vs. 62.4%, Table 1) than the Imp-550, nevertheless, the PP-0.5–550 still showed a higher activity for the simple CO oxidation (T10: 95 vs. 114 ℃, T50: 143 vs. 165 ℃ for the PP-0.5–550 and Imp-550, Fig. 2). This could be due to the higher proportion of the highly active Pd2+ species [56] in the PP-0.5–550 than the Imp-550 (0.71 vs. 0.55, Fig. 7a). After aging, however, the PP-0.5–1000 and Imp-1000 showed much closer Pd2+ proportion (0.81 vs. 0.87, Fig. 7a), then the higher Pd dispersion (3.2 vs. 1.6%, Table 1) of the PP-0.5–1000 than the Imp-1000 as well as the slightly higher Ce3+/Cetotal ratio (0.39 vs. 0.38, Fig. 7b) and (Oα +Oβ)/Ototal ratio (0.77 vs. 0.75, Fig. 7c) would contribute to the higher activity in the PP-0.5–1000, regarding the simple CO oxidation (Figure 2, T10: 180 vs. 208 ℃, T50: 198 vs. 230 ℃ for the PP-0.5–1000 and Imp-1000) and the complex three-way catalytic reactions over the powder samples (see details in Fig. 3). It was also found in Fig. 7 that the PP-0.5–550 showed higher stability in the ratios of Pd2+/Pdtotal, Ce3+/Cetotal and (Oα +Oβ)/Ototal against thermal aging than the Imp-550, due to the suppressed growth in the size of the Pd NPs, demonstrating again the advantage of the pre-precipitation method. 4 Conclusions By adopting the pre-precipitation method to replace the traditional impregnation, resistance of the Pd NPs against thermal aging was greatly improved. Compared with the reference Imp-1000, the PP-0.5–1000 showed enhanced catalytic performance for the three-way catalytic reactions: the T10 or T50 values were all decreased for the removal of CO, NO and C3H6, even on the monolith converter level. The CO-TPR, XPS and lean/rich cycling tests determined that the PP-0.5–1000 exhibited improved reducibility, more concentrated adsorbed oxygen species as well as higher oxygen storage capacity than the Imp-1000. The anti-sintering strategy deigned following the Ostwald-ripening mechanism in this work could provide a promising alternative for the traditional impregnation method in the industrial manufacturing.

        "dc:description": "Restricting the Pd sintering during aging is crucial for the three-way catalysts (TWCs). Herein, following the Ostwald-ripening mechanism, Pd sintering in the commercial TWCs was greatly suppressed by increasing the initial size of the Pd NPs, through a pre-precipitation method. Our catalysts showed initially larger Pd NPs after calcination at 550 ℃ (3.3 vs. 1.8 nm) while smaller ones after aging at 1000 ℃ (35.0 vs. 70.1 nm) than the counterpart made by impregnation. The optimal aged catalyst showed much better performance than the counterpart: T50 was decreased by 40, 13 and 14 ℃ for CO, NO and C3H6 over the powder samples, and a higher oxygen storage capacity was observed (248 > 178 mg/L) over the monolith converters. The decreased size of the Pd NPs and the improved reducibility as well as the more concentrated adsorbed oxygen species for the optimal aged catalyst were responsible for the improved performance.",
