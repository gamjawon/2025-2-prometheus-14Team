HSU, CHARLES S. DULCEY*, JAMES S. HORWITZ** and MING C. LIN+ U.S. Army Chemical Research and Development Center, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21010-5423 (U.SA.) (Received September 6,1989; revised January 6,1990) Summary A low-temperature oxidation catalyst (monolithic Pt TiOg) has been characterized by studying the oxidation of dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) at 350 523 K under low pressure conditions. The concentrations of reagents (DMMP and Oa) and products (CO, COg and HgO) were directly sampled and analyzed with a computer-controlled mass spectrometer during the course of reaction. The major oxidation products detected were COg and HgO. The reaction was studied as a function of temperature, pressure and DMMP/Og ratios. The apparent activation energies of formation of COg and HgO were found to be 3.6 and 4.2 kcal mol~1, respectively. A comparison of performance between the monolithic catalyst and three-way pelleted auto- motive catalysts was made. It was found that the monolithic catalyst shows performance characteristics superior to three-way automotive catalysts in terms of operating temperature, DMMP destruction efficiency and reaction products. The difference in performance of these two catalysts may be due to the configuration of the substrate and Pt loading. Results of surface spectroscopic analysis (SAM and XPS) reveal the formation of Pa05 on catalyst surfaces. Introduction There is great interest in alternatives to absorbents, which suffer from breakthrough and disposal problems, for collective protection against chemi- cal and biological warfare (CBW) agents. One promising avenue is the use of practical oxidation catalysts to decompose agents [1,2]. The principal technical requirements are efficient decomposition of agents into non-toxic products, low catalyst operating temperature and immunity to poisoning effects. This last requirement may be a particular problem in the case of *Geo-Centers, Inc., Ft. Washington, MD 20744. **Naval Research Laboratory/National Research Council, Postdoctoral Associate.

Previously, we have studied the catalytic oxidation of the nerve agent simulant DMMP on Pt filament catalysts [3] and on alumina-supported catalyst pellets [4]. Both exhibit significant DMMP breakthrough and poisoning problems. In this work we present results on catalytic oxidation of DMMP on a monolithic oxidation catalyst which exhibits both high efficiency of DMMP oxidation and minimal poisoning at the relatively low operating temperature of 523 K. The results of surface spectroscopic analysis are also reported. Experimental The experimental apparatus is similar to that used in previous studies of pellet catalysts [4]. Briefly, a quartz reactor holding the monolithic catalyst was mated to a quadrupole mass spectrometer for sampling the reactor effluent. The catalyst was heated by tantalum wire wound on the reactor over sheaths of copper and corrugated mica which provide uniform heating of the catalyst. The catalyst (Allied-Signal SRC-2000), a monolithic catalyst prepared with titania washcoat and impregnated with Pt [5], was cut to the inner diameter of the reactor (9.6 mm. diam, 2.54 cm. long) and packed on the sides with ceramic wool to prevent any leakage, sitting on a ledge at the base of the reactor. The catalyst temperature was measured by a Pt/Pt Rh thermocouple inserted into a channel of the monolith. Due to the low vapor pressure of DMMP, the inlet line was heated to 323 K. The catalysts were conditioned with 10% Og in He for 30 min prior to a data run. Data runs were taken using 1% DMMP in He and 10% Og with total pressures between 40 and 100 mtorr (typical flow rate 1 seem). The Oa and DMMP were admitted to a preheated catalyst to eliminate loading of a cold catalyst by the DMMP. Temperature dependence of reaction products was measured by dropping the catalyst temperature after several hours of running to achieve stable conditions. A blank monolithic substrate was used to establish the baseline for measurement of catalyst performance. The fresh and the DMMP-exposed low-temperature oxidation catalysts were analyzed using scanning Auger microprobe (SAM) and X-ray photo- electron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques, for which a Perkin-Elmer Model 570 surface spectroscopic system was used. For SAM analysis, normally 3 kV and a lOnA electron beam was used. For XPS analysis, we used 14 kV and 300WMgK X-ray source (1253.6 eV) with 100 and 50 eV passing energies for XPS survey and multiplex runs, respectively. The test chamber is routinely maintained at 3.0 x lO'^torr. The system energy calibration is based on the binding energies of Cu(2p) and Cu(3p) after pure Cu metal was sputtered for 15 min with an argon ion gun (15A/min sputtering rate). In calculating the atomic concentration of each identified element, the elemental detection sensitivity factors were taken into account. 391 Results and discussion Figure 1 shows a comparison of the reactor effluent from the monolithic catalyst and a blank, both after several hours of DMMP challenge, demon- strating catalyst efficiency and principal reaction products. The effluent from the blank monolith shows several prominent masses from DMMP fragmenta- tion, as well as Og and some traces of HaO and N3 present in the mass spectrometer. In the catalyst run, there is production of COg and HgO. However, there is no increase at mass 28, where CO production would be observed if present. No phosphorus-containing reaction products other than DMMP ionization fragments were observed. Principal reaction products and a DMMP fragment (mass 79) were followed as function of time for DMMP + Oa to evaluate catalyst performance, Fig. 2. DMMP shows negligible breakthrough after as many as 6 h for all monolithic catalyst samples maintained at or above 523 K. Runs with the same catalyst on three successive days showed the same performance for a total exposure of 16 h. Principal reaction products COg and HgO increase with time and start to plateau, possibly due to COg and HgO adsorption on the catalyst. No CO production was seen. Data runs with blank monoliths under identical conditions showed quick penetration by DMMP with no growth of the COa and HgO reaction products. Comparison of DMMP signals between the catalyst and blank after comparable exposure times indicate a destruction efficiency above 99.9%. A run of DMMP on the monolithic catalyst in the absence of Og is revealing (Fig. 3). Initially COa and HgO, the expected oxidation reaction products, appear. The reaction products generated are presumably due to decomposition of DMMP molecules. These products soon plateau and the CRTRLYST BLRNK 100 Fig. 1.

This is accompanied by an increase in CO, the predominant product in an oxygen-starved environment. Eventually, DMMP begins to penetrate the catalyst bed. In Fig. 4, the results from the reaction of DMMP + Og on a monolithic catalyst maintained below the normal operating temperature show similari- ties to those in the absence of Oa. Amounts of reaction products COg and HgO initially rise, only to fade shortly after. DMMP begins to break through as the other reaction products decline. Interestingly, CO does not build up, as in the oxygen-lean data, indicating that partial oxidation to CO requires that Og be omitted from feed gas. Fig. 3.

Products of the reaction of DMMP+O^ on a catalyst held below the operating temperature (180 C); symbols as in Fig. 2. Temperature dependences were measured for the principal reaction products COg and HgO (Fig. 5). Arrhenius plots were made for a number of Oz/DMMP ratios. Apparent activation energies were found to be quite low for each species and have no noticeable dependence on the Og/DMMP ratio over the range of 5:1 to 20:1 (Stoichiometric oxidation requires a ratio of 5:1).

These low values indicate that gas phase diffusion to the catalyst is slower than the actual intrinsic reaction rate on the surface of the very active catalyst and thus determines the overall rate of destruction of DMMP. It is evident that the monolithic catalyst is capable of efficiently oxidizing DMMP to COg and HgO without generating poisonous CO at the intended operating temperature and in the abundance of oxygen present in air. The lack of any observed phosphorus-containing reaction products is surprising, considering the lack of observable poisoning at the intended operating temperature (SS523K). On the other hand, catalysts run below the intended operating temperature with insufficient Oz to completely oxidize the DMMP to COg, HaO and PaOg showed irreversible poisoning with decreased activity in subsequent runs on the same catalyst (Fig. 6, 02/DMMP=1,448-455 K). This indicates that different phosphorus- containing products may result at different temperatures, low 02:DMMP ratios, and with different types of catalysts, e.g. pellet catalysts show poisoning effects at 523 K whereas monolithic catalysts do not. From the data and above observations, it is clear that the monolithic catalyst shows none of the poisoning effects and exhibits much higher destruction efficiency at the intended operating conditions than that observed for alumina-supported pellet catalysts. In the study of a variety of commer- cial three-way pelleted automotive catalysts [4], even the best of the pellet catalysts was found to exhibit more than 10% breakthrough after 6h of DMMP challenge at 773 K, as compared to well below 0.2% for the monolithic catalyst with similar gas mixtures and pressures at an operating tempera- ture of 523 K. The results of an XPS survey of fresh and DMMP-exposed low- temperature oxidation catalysts are shown in Fig. 7. The elements common Fig. 6.

The detection of Mg, Al, and Si, however, was presumably due to the monolithic support (cordierite). Additionally, phosphorus was also detected on the DMMP-exposed catalyst. The phosphorus binding energy of 136.59 eV in- dicates the possibility ofPz05 formation. The spectra of XPS multiplex of the detected elements were obtained and the area under the peak was integrated 396 TABLE 1 Atomic concentrations (%) of the identified elements on fresh and DMMP-exposed low- temperature oxidation catalysts Element Fresh catalyst DMMP-exposed catalyst 0 Al C Ti Si Pt Mg Ce P 32.8 28.7 19.2 12.5 2.9 2.2 0.5 0.9 0.0 36.0 28.5 14.4 11.8 2.0 2.4 1.3 1.1 1.9 with computer software, wherein the detection sensitivity of each element was taken into account. The atomic concentrations of the detected elements are shown in Table 1 and the XPS spectrum of phosphorus obtained from the DMMP-exposed catalyst is shown in Fig. 8. Because of the peak overlapping between Pt(4f) and Al(2p) around the binding energy of 74-75 eV, the Pt(4d3/a) and Pt(4d5/a) peaks were used for platinum peak area integration. The content of platinum was determined to be 2.2 and 2.4 atomic % for fresh Fig. 8. XPS spectrum of phosphorus from the DMMP-exposed low-temperature oxidation catalyst. 397 and DMMP-exposed catalysts, respectively. The concentration of carbon on the DMMP-exposed catalyst did not show any increase as compared with that of the fresh one. Indeed, due to the test condition (elevated temperature and oxidizing environment), carbon on the fresh catalyst was mostly oxidized to COg, which was detected as one of the two major reaction products. As a result, the carbon concentration on the DMMP-exposed catalyst was slightly lower than that of the fresh one. Carbon fouling did not seem to occur under the test conditions. The cause of DMMP deactivation of the catalyst, if it occurs, can then be attributed to the accumulation of P-containing compound, possibly P205, on the catalyst surface [6]. To understand the location of phosphorus on the DMMP-exposed catalyst, Auger mapping was conducted. Due to the excessive charging on the catalyst sample, the relationship between Pt and P cannot be established from the elemental Auger maps of platinum and phosphorus. Decomposition of DMMP and phosphonate esters on aluminum oxide was studied by Templeton and Weinberg using inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy in the temperature range of 200-673 K and with DMMP pressure between 3xl0~4 and lOtorr [7,8]. Interesting findings in their work were (1) at 200 K, DMMP was adsorbed in a molecular form; (2) above 295 K, DMMP adsorbed in a dissociative form, and (3) as the temperature was increased above 473 K, DMMP underwent dealkylation to form methylphosphonate on the surface. Since the experiment was carried out under vacuum (absence of oxygen), no DMMP oxidation products were observed. In a separate study by Henderson and White [9], decomposition of DMMP on Pt(lll) single crystals was conducted using various high resolu- tion electron spectroscopic techniques. DMMP decomposition to form exclu- sively CO and Hz was observed when the temperature was raised above 300 K, with P and a small amount of C remaining on the Pt surface. P OCHa and P CHa bonds were cleaved in the range of 300-400 K and 400 500 K, respectively, with predominately PO and an unidentified PO^ species on the surface. In an earlier study, we detected for the first time PO radicals at 325 nm with laser-induced fluorescence techniques during the reaction of DMMP with oxygen on polycrystalline Pt surfaces above HOOK [3]. The PO desorption activation energy was also determined to be 59 2kcalmol-l, indicative of strong bonding of phosphorus-containing compound to the Pt surface [3]. Similarly, Henderson and White reported that under the non-oxidizing environment, P was accumulated on the Pt surface [8]. This observation leads one to anticipate that under oxidizing conditions, one would expect the formation of phosphorus oxides on the Pt sur- face. Our finding of P-sOs on the DMMP-exposed low-temperature monolithic catalyst surface is consistent with the results reported in the literature [3,8]. Conclusions Conclusions can be drawn from the results of mass spectrometric investigation and surface spectroscopic analysis of the low-temperature 398 monolithic oxidation catalyst exposed to DMMP as follows: (1) COg and HgO were the major oxidation products at 523 K and above. (2) No detectable breakthrough of DMMP was noted over 16 h of operation at 523 K with Oa/DMMP > 1. No apparent poisoning was observed during the course of this study. (3) The apparent activation energies for COg and HgO formation were estimated from Arrhenius plots to be 3.6 and 4.2 kcal mol~1, respectively. (4) A comparison was made between this monolithic oxidation catalyst and three-way pelleted automotive catalysts. The low-temperature mono- lithic oxidation catalyst operated at 523 K maintains destruction efficiency superior to three-way pelleted automotive catalysts, which require an operating temperature of 673 K. Additionally, the monolithic catalyst has shown longer life than three-way pelleted automotive catalysts, possibly due to the difference in the configuration of substrates and Pt loadings. (5) XPS analysis revealed the formation of P-sOs on the DMMP-exposed low-temperature monolithic catalyst. Based on this information, DMMP deactivation of the catalyst, if it occurs, may be directly attributed to the formation PgOg on the Pt active site.
