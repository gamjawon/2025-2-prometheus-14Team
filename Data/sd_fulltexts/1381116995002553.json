Zelinsky Institute of Organic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, 117913 Moscow, Russia Received 24 May 1995; accepted 25 August 1995 Abstract JOURNALOF MOLECULAR CATALYSIS A: CHEMICAL It has been shown that norbornadiene (NBD) is dimerized in the presence of rhodium zeolite systems forming hexacyclodimers, exo-endo- and ertdo-endo-hexacyclo[9.2.1.0''6.03'8.02'059]tetradec-l2-enes preferentially. The effect of the structure, preparation procedure and pretreatment of the catalysts on their activity and selectivity in norbotnadiene cyclodimerization and the change in the rhodium electronic state in the course of the reaction have been studied. Alcohols (nortricyclan-3-of and norbornen-5-ol) and ethers (3-tricyclo[2.2.1.02'6]-heptyloxy-3')bicyclo[2.2.ljhept-5-ene and 3,3'oxydinortricyclane) as well as norbornadiene cyclodimers were formed when the catalysts containing both the rhodium and acid sites were pretreated with retaining adsorbed water. Interaction of the Rh/Na-ZSM-S catalyst with H2 or norbornadiene under mild conditions (130-150) leads to the stabilization of a significant portion of rhodium in the form of Rh(I), and apparently a complex formed is like that of [NBD-Rh(I)]-0.,. Norbornadiene cyclodimerization takes place with the participation of the active centres localized on the outside surface of the zeolite crystals. Keywords: Norbornadiene; Rhodium; Zeolite; Cyclodimerization 1. Introduction Bicyclo[2.2.1 ]hepta-2,5-dime (norbornadiene, NBD) is a useful intermediate for production of various valuable chemicals such as polycyclic hydrocarbons including norbornadiene dimers, the ingredients of high-energetic mixtures [ 1,2].

The efficiency of a heterogeneous catalyst has been also demonstrated in this reaction. Four different compounds were obtained over 5% Rh/C, selectivity toward NBD hexacyclic dimers approached 70% [8]. The development of the selective catalysts is of fundamental importance since a great number of dimers and trimers can be obtained in oligomerization of NBD [7]. Therefore, it was interesting to employ the known properties of zeolites, e.g., shape selectivity and capability of 160 N.F. Gol'dshleger et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 106 (1996)159-168 stabilizing an unusual metal oxidation state [9,10] to decide this problem. This work presents the results of the first study on the influence of the method of preparation and pretreatment of zeolite catalysts on their activity and selectivity in norbomadiene cyclodimerization. The rhodium electronic state in Rh/Na-ZSM-5 was examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in the course of the reaction. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials Norbornadiene was purified by two successive rectifications over sodium and stored in evacuated ampoule at 5. 3-Hydroxynortricyclane and its ethers were prepared as described in [11,12]. Cyclodimers of NBD used as the standards for GLC analysis were prepared as described elsewhere [4,6,8]. The NaY zeolite used has a Si02/A1203 ratio of 4.4. The Na-ZSM-5 zeolite (Si02/A1203 = 33.3) synthesized without an organic template and the Na-ZSM-8 zeolite (Si02/A1203 = 46) synthesized in the presence of tetraethylammonium bromide were obtained according to [13]. Decationized modification of zeolites were obtained from the Na parent forms by exchange with ammonium nitrate (2 M) for NaY and ammonium chloride (2 M) for NaZSM-5 followed by calcination under a flow of dry air at 500 during 8 h. The degree of cation exchange was denoted as a number before H in the zeolite symbol. 2.2. Preparation of catalysts Ion-exchanged samples containing rhodium were prepared by the procedure described for Rh/NaY in [14]. The powdery zeolite Na-ZSM5 (22.25 g) with a moisture content of 8.9% was stirred with 300 ml of H20 at room temperature for 2 h. The suspension was centrifuged and a liquid with pH 8.8 decanted. Zeolite was repeatedly washed with H20 and then suspended in 250 ml H 20. At vigorous stirring, 30 ml of 2.2 X 10-2 N aqueous solution of RhCl 3 - 3H 20 (pH 5 on addition of Na02CCH3) were added in small portions to suspension during 30 min. After completing the solution addition, the stirring was continued for 4 h at 50-60. Then the exchanged zeolite catalyst was filtered, washed thoroughly with water, followed by drying overnight in air at 80. The catalyst contained 0.3% rhodium. Same procedure was used for 0.7% Rh/Na-ZSM-5. Other catalysts were obtained by impregnation of powder Na-ZSM-5 and 0.85H-NaY zeolites heated at 500 with a calculated amount of aqueous solutions of RhCI3 or [Rh(NH3)5Cl]C12. The catalysts were activated in a dry air flow at 500 for 5 h before use. When the effect of the preliminary reduction of catalysts with H 2 was studied, the respective samples were calcined at 500, cooled to 150 in a flow of argon for 2 h, reduced in a pure hydrogen stream (10 ml/min) at 150 or 500 for 5 h, and then cooled to room temperature in same hydrogen stream and stored in a sealed glass ampoule. 2.3. Procedure for catalytic reaction The catalyst calcined was transferred without contact with air to glass ampoules (a capacity of 3 ml), NBD refrozen by using of a vacuum line (catalyst:NBD = 1:5, w/w), the ampoules were evacuated, sealed and heated at 130 during 1 h. At the reaction completion the ampoules contents were extracted repeatedly with hexane, concentrated and analyzed. GLC of reaction mixture was performed on a `Biochrom-l' chromatograph equipped with a 15% Silicone E-301 on Chromatone N-AW-DMCS column (500 cm 0.3 cm) and a flame ionization detector. N2 was used as a gas-carrier; a column temperature was 220. Diphenyl was used as an internal stan- N.F.

Product identification was by GLC using authentic materials. 2.4. XPS measurement The samples of rhodium-containing zeolites studied by XPS were pressed into pellets, treated (see Table 4) and introduced into XPS spectrometer without exposure to air using a glove box and techniques described elsewhere [15]. XPS spectra were obtained on an ES-200B spectrometer according to [16]. Binding energies ( Eb) were corrected by using C 1 s ( Eb = 285 eV) and Si 2p ( Eb = 103.8 eV) photoelectron lines. The atomic ratios of Na/Si, Na/Al and Rh/Si were calculated from integrated photoelectron peak intensities which were corrected for the photoionization cross section and the instrumental sensitivity factors. Deconvolution of the Rh 3d level for Rh-containing zeolites was carried out on a PDP 1 I /03L minicomputer using a program for the synthesis of Gaussian peaks. The intensity ratio Rh 3d5/2/Rh 3d3/Z, the spin-orbit splitting and the halfwidth on halfheight (HWHH) of the 3d5/Z and 3d 3/2 components upon deconvolutions were kept the same as in Rh 3d spin doublets of individual rhodium compounds [ 17]. The accuracy of the determination of Eb was .2 eV; the accuracy of the atomic ratios was 10-20%. 3. Results Investigation of norbornadiene conversion with zeolites obtained either in Na- or H-form and then modified with the transition elements, e.g. Rh, Pd or Ni, showed that in the absence of reducing agents only Rh-containing zeolites acted as catalysts in cyclodimerization of NBD within a wide temperature range (30-200) both in neat norbornadiene and in various solvents Z. As seen from Table 1, in their presence the reaction proceeded with the preferential formation of exo-endo- and endo-endohexacyclo[9.2.1.0 46.0 ~~8.02~ 1059 ]tetradec-12- enes (compounds 1 and 2), but, depending on the reaction conditions, pentacyclic dimers 3 and oxygen-containing compounds 4 and 5 may be formed (Scheme 1).

Effect of the structure and composition of zeolite Distribution of the NBD conversion products and their yields depend on the structure and the chemical composition of the zeolite (Table 1). Various zeolites including wide-pore faujasites were studied in present paper. The highest yields of cyclodimers were observed in the presence of samples prepared from sodium form of parent pentasil. If the samples containing both rhodium and acid sites were activated with retaining adsorbed water, the formation of dieters 1-3 was accompanied by the formation of oxygencontaining products: alcohols 4 (nortricyclan-3ol and norbornen-5-ol) and ethers 5 ({3tricyclo[2.2.1.026]-heptyloxy-3'}bicyclo[2.2.1 ]- hept-5-ene and 3,3'-oxydinortricyclane) (runs 5, 7, 8, Table 1). These compounds might be obtained as a result of norbornadiene hydration with H20 retained in zeolite after its pretreatment. Subsequent addition of alcohols formed to NBD or dehydration of alcohols give rise to ethers. Interaction of NBD with H20 in the presence of the H-forms of zeolites, which contaro no rhodium, among them H-ZSM-S, was earlier shown to result in the formation of alcohols and ethers only [ 12]. Rhodium introduced into H-ZSM-S suppressed the acid-catalyzed reactions of norbornadiene (Table 1). The effect of adsorbed water on the acid-catalyzed NBD conversion was confirmed by the decrease in the selectivity of dieters formation from 90% (run 5) down to 52% (run.8) which was demon- strated for 0.5% Rh/H-ZSM-S by the decrease in the temperature of pretreatment from S00 down to 300. 3.2. Effect of rhodium content With the increase in the rhodium content in the catalysts, obtained both via ion exchange (runs 1, 2, Table 1) and impregnation (runs 3 and 4, Table 1), their activity in the conversion of NBD diminishes. It should be noted that oxygen-containing products were almost absent, if the cation-exchanged 0.3% Rh/Na-ZSM-S and impregnated samples of various composition were used. At the same time, detectable amounts of alcohols and ethers appear in the presence of ion-exchanged 0.7% Rh/Na-ZSM5. In this case the decrease in the selectivity toward NBD hexadimers could be assigned to the formation of a greater quantity of acidic sites as a result of the decomposition of water molecules on rhodium ions during preparation and activation of the zeolite catalyst. 3.3. Effect of pretreatment temperature The effect of the conditions of catalyst pretreatment on distribution of the products of norbornadiene conversion and the yields of hexacyclic dieters 1 and 2 were investigated using as an example 0.3% Rh/Na-ZSM-S (Fig. 1 and Table 2).

In this case, the selectivity toward hexacyclic dimers amounts to 60% and the reaction mixture contains a large quantity of 4 and 5. As Tpr increases, the yield of dimers grows, whereas that of alcohols and ethers decreases. Similar data were obtained in the case of 0.5% Rh/H-ZSM-5 catalyst (runs 5,8, Table 1). At 500, the optimum TPr, the catalyst found to exhibit high activity and selectivity in cyclodimerization of NBD (Fig. 1). The effect of calcination on the selectivity of 0.3% Rh/Na-ZSM-5 catalyst (ion exchange) can be associated with the change of the content and the state of water which take part not only in a side reaction of hydration of N13D, but also influences the rhodium state and the adsorption capacity of the catalyst. The relationship between these functions results in the extreme dependence of the catalyst activity in the pretreatment temperature. Deactivation of the catalyst at Tpr = 900 is probably associated with the location of the Rh ions in the zeolite sites not accessible by NBD rather than with pentasil structure destruction. 3.4. Effect of solvents It was shown that some solvents such acetone, acetonitrile, DMSO and morpholine inhib- 163 ited completely cyclodimerization of NBD with 0.3% Rh/Na-ZSM-5. On the contrary, both in ethanol and C3-C4 alcohols, the catalyst exhibited the same activity as in the solvent absence. In this case, the selectivity toward dimers I and 2 amounted to 98% (Table 3). Note, that ethanol and acetone were the best solvents for norbornadiene cyclodimerization in the presence of [Rh(02CCF3)NBD]2 [6,18]. 3.5. Effect of dihydrogen pretreatment It is known that the treatment of transition metal-containing zeolites with hydrogen results in the formation of highly dispersed metallic clusters and ions in the intermediate oxidation state [19]. Recently we have also shown that norbornadiene is dimerized with catalytic amounts of Rh2(OZCCF3)4, the Rh(I) complex formed in the system being the catalyst of the process [20]. Therefore it was of interest to study the effect of H 2 pretreatment of the ionexchanged 0.3% Rh/Na-ZSM-5 catalyst on its catalytic activity and selectivity in cyclodimerization of NBD. The activity of the catalyst which was reduced by HZ at 150 prior to the cyclodimerization reaction was equal to 260 mol dimers/g-at.

The catalytic activity decreases down to 100 mol dimers/g-at. Rh h with the increase in the temperature of H 2 pretreatment to 500. Therefore, one can assume that at low temperature Rh3+ is reduced mainly to the Rhl+ state, which is probably a catalytically active site (see also below). At higher temperature, a major portion of Rh species could be reduced to the metallic state and the concentration of the active sites decreased. Stepwise reduction of Rh3+ by H2 previously observed for samples of Rh/Si02 [21 ]. 3.6. Effect of ligands We studied the influence of chemical modification on the properties of the 0.3% Rh/NaZSM-5 catalyst. Both 4-methylquinoline (4MeQ) and PPh 3 used as modificators have an effective molecular size which inhibits their easy penetration into the catalyst channels [22,23]. It was found that 4-MeQ added to the reaction mixture (in molar ratio 4-MeQ:Rh = 1:1 calculating to all rhodium) reduced the catalyst activity by 50%, but did not affect the selectivity. When the amount of 4-MeQ was further increased, cyclodimerization of NBD was completely suppressed. Addition of PPh3 to the reaction mixture (in molar ratio Rh:PPh3 = 1:1 or 1:2) results in the form ation of endo-cis-endoheptacyclo[8.4.0.01 .12.03.8.04.6.05.9.011.15 Iteta- decane (`binor-S') rather than bisnorbomadienes of 1 and 2. 3.7. XPS of the catalysts Interaction of NBD with Rh/Na-ZSM-5 catalysts prepared both by ion exchange and impregnation was studied by means of XPS technique (see Fig. 2 and Table 4). In all initial samples, rhodium is present as Rh3+ ions with Rh 3d5/2 binding energy of about 310 eV. As seen from the Rh/Si atomic ratio, the ion ex- change facilitates the penetration of Rh3+ aquacomplexes into the zeolite channels (in comparison with impregnation) [16]. Thermal treatment of cation-exchanged samples (500) leads to a considerable decrease in the Rh/Si ratio, which evidences for the further Rh3+ cation migration into the zeolite crystals. Analysis of the data on Rh 3d5/2 binding energy leads to the conclusion that Rh exists as Rh3+ isolated cations in ionexchanged zeolites and that the aggregates of j3+_0_x:1+\\ type are present in the samples obtained by the impregnation [ 16]. Interaction of NBD with sample 9 at 130 during 15 min (run 10, Table 4) results in complete transition of Rh3+ to the oxidation state with Rh 3d5/2 binding energy of 308.8 eV characteristic of Rh(I) in individual compounds of Rh(I), particularly in the [Rh(02CCF.3)NBD]2 complex (Table 4). This form of Rh composed also the greater portion in the samples of 3 and 7, NBD being a milder reducing agent as compared with H 2.

Thus NBD is an efficient reductant of Rh3+ in Na-ZSM-S. Stabilization of rhodium in the intermediate oxidation state is a peculiarity of the initial reduction stage. Apparently, the selective formation of Rh(I) complex stabilized by NBD and oxygen of the zeolite framework, i.e., [(NBD)Rh]+-O~ol, can be achieved by varying the reduction conditions. Reduction of rhodium with NBD is accompanied by the increase in the Rh/Si ratio and the decrease in that of Na/Si and Na/Al (Table 4). This suggests NBD-induced Rh reserve migration from the zeolite cavities onto the outside surface followed by the opposite migration of sodium ions (runs 3, 7 and 10, Table 4). 4. Discussion Results presented above show that rhodiumcontaining zeolites, Rh/Na-ZSM-S, are the active solid catalysts for norbornadiene cyclodimerization. The data on the catalytic activity of the Rh(I) complexes, Rh-containing zeolite and those on the concentration of Rhl + in various samples are presented in Table 5.

They appear via Rh3 + reduction in Rh/NaZSM-5 either with hydrocarbon or with dihydrogen under mild conditions at the reduction temperature below 150 and form [NBDRh(I)]-OZeol complexes evidently. This identification is based on the comparison of the Eb values of Rh 3d5/2 for Rh(I) in the [Rh(OZCCF3)NBD]Z compound and for the Rh in intermediate state of oxidation in the zeolite treated with NBD (Table 4). The Eb Rh 3d5/2 value equal to 308.6 eV was also found for rhodium supported as [Rh(NBD)SZ]+ (S = solvent) onto montmorillonite [24]. This is in a good agreement with the data presented for Rh/Na-ZSM (Table 4). In the presence of 0.3% Rh/Na-ZSM-S, the solvent effect on the norbornadiene conversion is similar to that observed for Rh(I) complex, i.e. [Rh(OZCCF,)NBD]2 [18,20]. It should be noted that the chemical analysis shows all rhodium to be retained on the zeolite. The sol- 166 N.F. Col'dshleger et al. /Journal of Moleculm vents with high donor ability (for instance, morpholine) inhibit cyclodimerization of NBD catalyzed with both complex and Rh-containing zeolite. Amine exhibits a similar effect on dimerization of NBD catalyzed by Rh(1) in solution [25]. However, the XPS observation of Rho under the prolonged treatment of Rh/NaZSM-5 with NBD indicates that a complex formed and attached to the zeolite matrix is not sufficiently stable. Rhodium solvation can promote its stabilization as [Rh(NBD)S2]+ species, which are responsible for the catalytic activity as in the case of the homogeneous reaction. The selectivity in the formation of cyclic norbornadiene dimers in the presence of [Rh(02CCF,)NBD]2 is regulated by the ligand environment of the rhodium atoms [18,20]. Modification of the Rh/Na-ZSM-5 catalyst with 4-MeQ and PPh3 was carried out to change the selectivity of the cyclodimer formation and to find out whether the reaction proceeded on the external surface or in the intracrystalline space of the zeolite. The catalyst deactivation found with 4-MeQ gave some evidences in favour that rhodium located on the external surface was involved as a catalytically active site. Formation of a stable complex of Rh with 4-MeQ like the Catalyst a Catalysis A: Chemical 106 (1996)159-768 non-active [Rh(NBD)L2]C104 (L = heteroaromatic amine) compound [25] could explain deactivation, provided that rhodium located in the channels is non-accessible for NBD. Modification of the Rh/Na-ZSM-5 catalyst with PPh _, confirmed our conclusion that the rhodium species on the surface of the zeolite crystals are supposed to be active sites and Rh\"+ to be reduced under NBD action. There is a total analogy between the cyclodimerization course in the presence of Rh(I) complex and rhodium supported onto the zeolite [20,26]: in the presence of PPh3 dimerization of NBD proceeded in both cases as cycloaddition of [4,7r + 47T ]-type with the formation of `binor-S' instead of 1 and 2 dimers (Scheme 2). At the same time, no strong correlation between the Rh' + content and the catalytic activity of Rh/Na-ZSM-5 was observed (Table 5), thus indicating the contribution of other factors to the catalyst activity. Rhodium was found to be fully reduced in the ion exchanged 0.3% Rh/Na-ZSM-5 at 500. Formation of norbornadiene cyclodimers in the presence of this catalyst evidences that highly dispersed Rho species might also form catalytically active sites.

Col'dshleger et al./Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 106 (1996) 159-168 rhodium ions as well as the ability of Rho to be oxidized to Rhl + with water or extra-framework oxygen can be also anticipated. High dispersion of the Rho particles should be considered as a prerequisite to provide its oxidation to the Rhl + in the reaction conditions. Therefore, the low Rh percentage zeolite catalysts, which were reduced at low temperature, seem to be the most appropriate samples to generate the species of this kind. These considerations explain the extreme behaviour of the dependence of the rhodium-zeolites activity on the reduction temperature and a higher activity of 0.3% Rh/NaZSM-5 as compared with other samples with a higher metal loading. The data obtained allow one to propose the following scheme of NBD-induced modification of rhodium in the surface layer of solid catalysts. 1. Interaction of the Rh3+ ions with NBD is accompanied by the rhodium migration from the a 1 83 167 zeolite channels onto the outside of the zeolite crystals and Rh reduction: R3+ OZ- NBD h --.> [Rh(NBD)] + OZ- NBD is well known as a ligand with a strong coordinating ability [27] 2. Rho is formed due to the reduction of Rh' + by either hydrocarbon or hydrogen or disproportionation of Rhs+ and is probably well dispersed, that is characteristic of the samples with the low Rh content, treated at low temperature [ 19]. As seen from Table 1 and 5, the low content rhodium catalysts prepared by ion exchange of Rh3+ with Na-ZSM-5 or by impregnation exhibit the highest selectivity towards cyclodimers. This is in good agreement with a higher Na/Al ratio and a less pronounced decrease in Na+ concentration in the surface layer of the catalyst in the course of the reaction 2 13 1 + 2 + 3 + Zr~_OH ~ OH 3 a 0.3% Rh/Na-ZSM-5 (or [(NBD)RhOZCCF3]2, ethanol) b 0.5% Rh/H-ZSM-5 + Hz0 c 0.3% RhiNa-ZSM-5 + PPh3 (or [(NBD)RhOZCCF3]z + PPh3, ethanol) Scheme 2. 168 N.F. Gol'dshleger et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 106 (1996) 159-168 (Table 4). Thus the acid sites created by water decomposition on the rhodium ions or during rhodium reduction are better neutralized, which results in the decrease in the yields of products 4and5. High mobility of rhodium in the zeolite matrix, the concomitant enrichment of the surface layer with rhodium due to migration from the framework channels and its coordination with NBD followed norbornadiene cyclodimerization on the outside surface of the zeolites did not allow the exhibition of molecular sieve properties of the zeolites to change the selectivity of the rhodium-containing zeolite catalysts studied. 5. Conclusion The variety of the data obtained clearly demonstrates that the active intermediate states of rhodium can be generated in the zeolite catalysts like that it is realized for the rhodium complexes in solution. The most efficient way is the reduction of Rh zeolite with the substrate, bicyclo[2.2.1 ]hepta-2,5-diene. Stability of Rh I + in the solid catalysts is provided not only due to coordination with NBD, but also as a result of interaction of rhodium with zeolite framework acting as a additional stabilizing ligand. That is the reason why the rhodium-containing zeolites, namely Rh/Na-ZSM-5, possess high activity and selectivity in norbornadiene cyclodimerization either in neat norbornadiene or in the presence of solvents.

It has been shown that norbornadiene (NBD) is dimerized in the presence of rhodium zeolite systems forming hexacyclodimers, exo-endo- and endo-endo-hexacyclo[9.2.1.04.6.03.8.02.10.05.9]tetradec-12-enes preferentially. The effect of the structure, preparation procedure and pretreatment of the catalysts on their activity and selectivity in norbornadiene cyclodimerization and the change in the rhodium electronic state in the course of the reaction have been studied. Alcohols (nortricyclan-3-ol and norbornen-5-ol) and ethers (3-tricyclo[2.2.1.02.6]-heptyloxy-3′)bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene and 3,3′-oxydinortricyclane) as well as norbornadiene cyclodimers were formed when the catalysts containing both the rhodium and acid sites were pretreated with retaining adsorbed water. Interaction of the Rh Na-ZSM-5 catalyst with H2 or norbornadiene under mild conditions (130–150°C) leads to the stabilization of a significant portion of rhodium in the form of Rh(I), and apparently a complex formed is like that of [NBD-Rh(I)]-Ozeol. Norbornadiene cyclodimerization takes place with the participation of the active centres localized on the outside surface of the zeolite crystals.
