Tel.: +86-21-6846-2197x6410; fax: +86-21-68462283 The bulk and surface properties of PdCl2–CuCl2–CH3COOK catalysts supported on activated carbon (a.c.) used in the synthesis of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) by gas-phase oxidative carbonylation of methanol were characterized by XRD and XPS techniques. On the basis of the catalyst characterization and evaluation results, the active species of the catalyst has been suggested, and the reaction mechanism of oxidative carbonylation has been proposed. The interaction between CH3COOK and PdCl2 or CuCl2 on the activated carbon support has been deduced from the formation of KCl, and the partial reduction of CuCl2–CuCl has been found. Furthermore, the presence of CuCl2 inhibits the reduction of PdCl2. The experimental results show that the main reason for catalyst deactivation could be attributed to the loss of chlorine. Fortunately, promoter CH3COOK could inhibit the loss of chlorine, and improve the electronic environment of PdCl2–CuCl2 catalyst, so that the stability and activity of the catalyst PdCl2–CuCl2–CH3COOK/a.c. increase. Keywords Dimethyl carbonate synthesis Gas-phase oxidative carbonylation Characterization Active species Reaction mechanism 1 Introduction Dimethyl carbonate (DMC) is a versatile chemical substance, which has been using mainly as a methylating, carbonylating or methoxycarbonylating agent. Many products can be prepared from it because of its unique property. In addition, it has been expected to be a safer substitute for toxic phosgene in polycarbonate synthesis. Now it has drawn more and more attention as a promising chemical compound in view of the increasing worldwide environmental problem. Several researchers have studied the reaction mechanism of DMC synthesis. Having studied the oxidative carbonylation of methanol in liquid-phase over catalyst CuCl, Romano et al. [1] proposed that the reaction might proceed initially through the oxidation of CuCl to cupric methoxychloride (Eq. (1)). (1) 2CH 3 OH+ 1 2 O 2+2Cu + Cl −→2(CuOCH 3)+ Cl −+H 2 O The latter was reduced by carbon monoxide, and CuCl was restored. Thus far the catalytic cycle was completed (Eq. (2)). (2) 2(CuOCH 3)+ Cl −+CO→2Cu + Cl −+(CH 3 O)2 CO A vapor-phase two-step process based on palladium catalyzed carbonylation of methyl nitrite has been developed by Nishihira et al. [2]. Methyl nitrite was produced in a separate step by the reaction of CH3OH, NO and O2 (Eqs. (3) and (4)) (3) 2CH 3 ONO+CO→(CH 3 O)2 CO+2NO (4) 2NO+2CH 3 OH+ 1 2 O 2→2CH 3 ONO+H 2 O King [3] elucidated the reaction mechanism of oxidative carbonylation of methanol in Cu–Y zeolite by in situ FT-IR technique. The first step is the oxidation of methanol and Cu(I) to form Cu(II)-methoxide. Then the insertion of CO to Cu(II)-methoxide forms probably a carbomethoxide. Finally, methanol and oxygen react with carbomethoxide to form dimethyl carbonate (Eqs. (5)–(7)). (5) 2CH 3 OH+ 1 2 O 2+2Cu + Ze −→2(CuOCH 3)+ Ze −+H 2 O (6) (CuOCH 3)+ Ze −+CO→(CH 3 O–CO–Cu)+ Ze − (7) 2(CH 3 O–CO–Cu)+ Ze −+2CH 3 OH+ 1 2 O 2→2(CH 3 O)2 CO+2Cu + Ze − It has been reported that the formation rate of dimethyl carbonate is strongly related to Cl/Cu ratio in the synthesis of dimethyl carbonate by oxidative carbonylation over catalyst CuCl2/a.c. [4]. The structure of supported catalyst PdCl2–CuCl2 used in CO oxidation has been investigated by many researchers. Yamamoto et al. [5] studied the structure and electronic state of PdCl2–CuCl2 catalyst supported on a.c. by XAFS technique, and found that Cu+ species existed on the support and was coordinated with three chlorine anions. The EXAFS analysis also showed the formation of Pd metal particles as well as Pd chloride species coordinated with three chlorine anions. In addition, they found that the formation of Pd metal was strongly suppressed by the presence of CuCl2. The supported catalyst PdCl2–CuCl2 used in CO oxidation was also studied by Kim et al. [6,7]. It was reported that the active species of Cu was Cu2Cl(OH)3 and the active species of Pd was Pd2+. In the previous papers, we have prepared supported catalyst PdCl2–CuCl2–CH3COOK/a.c. used in the synthesis of DMC by gas-phase oxidative carbonylation of methanol, and have given the research results such as catalyst preparation, catalytic properties, and functions of alkali promoters [8,9]. However, the mechanism of the synthesis reaction of DMC by gas-phase oxidative carbonylation does not seem to be well established at present, and the bulk and surface properties of catalyst PdCl2–CuCl2–CH3COOK/a.c. have rarely been reported so far. In this work, the bulk and surface properties of the catalyst have been studied, and the reaction mechanism has been proposed on the basis of catalyst characterization and evaluation. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The catalyst PdCl2–CuCl2–CH3COOK/a.c. was prepared by impregnating a.c. with aqueous 25% NH3 solution of a mixture of palladium chloride, copper chloride and potassium acetate. The concentration of the solution was PdCl 2=0.01 mol/l,CuCl 2=0.16 mol/l,CH 3 COOK=0.16 mol/l , respectively. Then the solvent was removed by vacuum evaporation at 50°C for 4h and subsequently pretreated at 200°C for 2h in a N2 stream at atmosphere pressure. The preparation of catalyst with other alkali promoters was similar to that of catalyst PdCl2–CuCl2–CH3COOK/a.c.. The surface area of a.c. employed here is 1399m2 g−1. 2.2 Catalyst characterization 2.2.1 X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) X-ray diffraction patterns were measured at room temperature with a Japanese D/Max-2500 X-ray diffraction system. This diffractometer utilized Cu kα radiation and was operated at 50kV and 200mA. The range of the spectra in 2θ was from 5° to 80°. 2.2.2 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis The surface composition and structure of catalyst were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in a PHI-5300 ESCA system. An Al kα electron source was used with a power setting at 250W. Charge compensation was done with the adventitious C 1s peak at 284.6eV. 2.3 Catalyst evaluation Catalytic activity was measured at atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed flow system with a stainless steel tubular reactor of 8mm inner diameter, which has been described in our previous work [8]. The operation conditions were as follows: T=150°C,GHSV=1500 h −1,LHSV=4 h−1, and CO/O2=2.80. The reaction products passed through a cooling trap, then the uncondensed gas products and the liquid products collected in the cooling trap were analyzed by GC, respectively. The GC column analyzing gas products was packed with TDX-101, and another one analyzing liquid products was packed with the polyethylene glycol 20000 coated on GDX-101 carrier. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 XRD analysis In the XRD patterns of supported catalyst PdCl2–CuCl2–CH3COOK/a.c. before and after reaction (Fig. 1 a and b), the diffraction peaks attributed to the support activated carbon were observed on the sample. The XRD analysis showed that there were not diffraction peaks of Pd or Cu species on the catalyst, but the peaks attributed to crystallites of KCl were clearly observed, which presented the formation of KCl during the catalyst preparation. Furthermore, it was certain that KCl was stable during the reaction because the intensities of KCl peaks varied very little before and after reaction. In addition, it was suggested that Pd and Cu species on the support surface was highly dispersed or in amorphous state because they were invisible in the XRD pattern. In the XRD patterns of fresh catalyst PdCl2–CuCl2–CH3COONa/a.c. (Fig. 1c), there were also mainly diffraction peaks attributed to the support activated carbon. The XRD analysis showed that there were not diffraction peaks of Pd or Cu species on this catalyst, but the peaks attributed to crystallites of NaCl were clearly observed. All these are similar to those of catalyst PdCl2–CuCl2–CH3COOK/a.c.. It suggested that the formation of alkali chloride should be due to the reaction between alkali acetate and PdCl2 or CuCl2 because the chemical reagents used in the catalyst preparation did not contain alkali chloride. In order to gain further insight into the structure of the supported catalyst PdCl2–CuCl2–CH3COOK/a.c., an unsupported PdCl2–CuCl2–CH3COOK sample with the same atomic ratio of palladium, copper and potassium was prepared, and pretreated by the same methods as the supported catalyst. The XRD pattern showed that there were obvious peaks corresponding to crystallites of CuCl, which indicates that some Cu2+ species have been reduced into Cu+ species, but the Pd species was still invisible (Fig. 1d). The other difference of unsupported sample from the supported catalyst was that KCl did not emerge in the XRD pattern. The presence of CuCl and the disappearance of KCl in the unsupported sample may be due to the absence of support while the formation of KCl in the supported catalyst results from the interaction between the supported metal species and the support activated carbon. 3.2 XPS analysis The surface composition and structure of the catalysts were analyzed by XPS technique. In order to compare their differences conveniently, two single metal chloride catalysts PdCl2/a.c. and CuCl2/a.c., a bimetallic chloride catalyst PdCl2–CuCl2/a.c. and a multi-component catalyst PdCl2–CuCl2–CH3COOK/a.c. were prepared. In the XPS pattern of Pd3d in PdCl2/a.c. (Fig. 2 a), the peaks attributed to 337.6 and 335.2eV were peaks of Pd2+ and Pd0, respectively, which indicated that partial PdCl2 supported on activated carbon was reduced to Pd0 metal. The curve-fitting results of Cu2p XPS patterns in different catalysts are compared in Fig. 3 . The Cu2p peak in CuCl2/a.c. was fitted into two peaks of Cu+ at 932.5eV and Cu2+ at 934.7eV (Fig. 3a). The Cu2+ peak of 934.7eV represented CuCl2, the Cu+ species of 932.5eV represented CuCl. In the XPS pattern of Pd3d in PdCl2–CuCl2/a.c. (Fig. 2b), Pd metal disappeared while Pd3d peak became wider apparently, and it had a chemical shift of +0.3eV. The curve-fitting result of Cu2p XPS pattern (Fig. 3b) was similar to that of CuCl2/a.c. (Fig. 3a) and there were CuCl2 and CuCl in the catalyst. These results can be explained by the synergistic effect on the bimetallic chloride catalyst, i.e., the addition of CuCl2 prohibits the reduction of PdCl2 to Pd metal. The curve-fitting results of the Cu2p XPS patterns on fresh and deactivated catalyst PdCl2–CuCl2–CH3COOK/a.c. are listed in Fig. 3c and d, respectively. It is obvious that the Cu species in these two catalysts had three states, i.e., CuCl2, CuCl and CuO, but their relative amounts were different. The CuCl/CuCl2 and CuO/CuCl2 ratios are shown in Table 1 . In the deactivated catalyst, CuO was the most and CuCl was the least, which indicate that CuCl may be active species, and the increase in CuO may result in the deactivation of catalyst. 3.3 Investigation of catalytic active species In the XPS patterns of single metal chloride catalysts, partial PdCl2 in PdCl2/a.c. was reduced to Pd metal and partial CuCl2 in CuCl2/a.c. was reduced to CuCl by the reduction sites on the activated carbon surface. It is concluded that there are double redox species Pd2+/Pd0 on PdCl2/a.c. and Cu2+/Cu+ on CuCl2/a.c., respectively. From the evaluation results for catalytic activity in Table 2 , only trace DMC was formed on single metal chloride catalysts, which shows that the single metal chloride catalysts are active to the synthesis of DMC, but the activity is very low. The reaction of DMC synthesis over the two single metal chloride catalysts is suggested to take place according to redox mechanism; Pd2+/Pd0 and Cu2+/Cu+ are proposed to be active sites, respectively. The poor activity is due to the unstable structure and composition of the active species. However, Pd metal was not found in bimetallic chloride catalyst PdCl2–CuCl2/a.c. These findings that the reduction of PdCl2 was strongly suppressed by the presence of CuCl2 may be explained in terms of a preferential reduction of Cu2+ to that of Pd2+ on the reduction sites because of lower redox potential of Cu2+ to Cu+ (0.15V vs. Ag+/AgCl) than that of Pd2+ to Pd0 (0.92V) [10]. As previously noted, the synergistic effect exists between Pd and Cu on the bimetallic chloride catalyst PdCl2–CuCl2/a.c. The evaluation results over catalyst PdCl2–CuCl2/a.c. in Table 2 show that the activity of DMC synthesis increased markedly. It suggested that the increase in the catalytic activity is ascribed to the synergistic effect between Pd and Cu. On the basis of above discussion, we propose that the synthesis of DMC by oxidative carbonylation of methanol proceed according to redox mechanism, and the DMC yield increases greatly through the following reactions over catalyst PdCl2–CuCl2/a.c.: I. PdCl2+CO→Pd(CO)Cl2 II. Pd(CO)Cl2+2CH3OH→(CH3O)2CO+Pd0+2HCl III. Pd0+2CuCl2→PdCl2+2CuCl IV. 2CuCl+2CH 3 OH+ 1 2 O 2→2Cu(OCH 3)Cl+H 2 O V. 2Cu(OCH3)Cl+CO→(CH3O)2CO+2CuCl VI. 2CuCl+2HCl+ 1 2 O 2→2CuCl 2+H 2 O In the above reaction schemes, DMC is formed in both reactions II and V, which is the reason why the STY of DMC was considerably increased over the bimetallic chloride catalyst. The presence of CuCl2 is helpful to the completion of reactive cycle over PdCl2 species, and simultaneously CuCl2 is converted to the active species CuCl that is necessary in reaction IV. Manchot and Konig [11] first reported a compound with a formula, Pd(CO)Cl2, and the structure of [Pd2(CO)2Cl4] was proposed by Calderazzo and Dell’Amico [12]. 3.4 Analysis of reason for catalyst deactivation The catalyst PdCl2–CuCl2–CH3COOK/a.c. has been shown to be active as a catalyst in the oxidative carbonylation of methanol, but its stability is poor. As shown in Fig. 4 , the catalytic activity dropped markedly along with the reaction. Fresh and deactivated catalysts have been characterized by XPS technique, and the composition of element chlorine is listed in Table 1. The composition of element chlorine on the fresh catalyst surface was 3.41%, while it was only 2.98% on deactivated one. The difference means the loss of chlorine. As previously mentioned, it is concluded from Table 1 that the loss of chlorine, the decrease of CuCl, and the formation of CuO are the primary factors of catalyst deactivation. In order to confirm that the reason for catalyst deactivation is due to the loss of chlorine, the liquid product was analyzed by ion-selective electrode analysis. In this method, the 217-calomel electrode was used as reference electrode and the 301-chloride electrode was used as indicator electrode. The PHS-2 precision acidimeter was used to determine electromotive force. A series of standard solvents were prepared, and the Cl− concentration in the liquid product was determined by standard curve method. The time course of DMC yield and Cl− concentration in liquid product is shown in Fig. 4. The fact that Cl− was found in the liquid product shows that Cl− must have been lost from the metal chloride catalyst in the reaction process because the reactants did not contain chlorine. Furthermore, along with the loss of chlorine, the activity of catalyst decreased from the highest STY, 349–153g/lcath in the run time of 43h. Therefore, the main reason for catalyst deactivation could be attributed to the loss of chlorine. 3.5 Effects of alkali promoter The addition of alkali metal promoter K in the form of acetate CH3COOK can enhance the reactivity of the oxidative carbonylation of methanol on catalyst PdCl2–CuCl2/a.c. significantly. So it is necessarily to study the functions of promoter CH3COOK further. The atomic composition of Pd on the catalyst PdCl2–CuCl2/a.c. was 0.87% and Cu was 1.57%. According to stoichiometric number of PdCl2 and CuCl2, the composition of chlorine on the catalyst PdCl2–CuCl2/a.c. should be 4.34%, but in fact it was only 3.19% as listed in Table 1. This indicates that chlorine was lost during the catalyst preparation. The atomic composition of Pd on the catalyst PdCl2–CuCl2–CH3COOK/a.c. was 0.49% and Cu was 1.03%. According to stoichiometric number, the composition of chlorine should be 3.04%, but in fact it was 3.41% as listed in Table 1. These results show that CH3COOK not only inhibits the loss of chlorine, but also enriches it on the catalyst surface. Promoter CH3COOK makes the chlorine enrich on the surface of catalyst from bulk, and even exceed the stoichiometric number of the compounds, so that more active species comes into being on the catalyst surface, and the catalytic activity increases. A possible mechanism for the loss of chlorine in the impregnation of PdCl2 and CuCl2 on a.c. has been proposed by Yamamoto [5]. A partial reduction of PdCl2 to Pd metal and a partial reduction of CuCl2 to CuCl resulted in the loss of chlorine in HCl form in PdCl2/a.c. and CuCl2/a.c., respectively. The reduction of PdCl2 in PdCl2–CuCl2/a.c. catalyst was suppressed by the presence of CuCl2, and as a result CuCl and HCl were formed. As listed in Table 2, the addition of alkali metal promoter in the PdCl2–CuCl2–CH3COOK/a.c. catalyst increased the activity of catalyst markedly. Based on the XRD patterns of catalyst PdCl2–CuCl2–CH3COOK/a.c. and PdCl2–CuCl2–CH3COONa/a.c. in Fig. 1, the function of alkali promoter can be explained as follows: it can react with PdCl2 and CuCl2 during the pretreatment of catalyst (Eq. (8)), in which the active species is formed and alkali chloride is generated. (8) PdCl 2+CuCl 2+CH 3 COOM→Pd(CO)Cl 2+Cu(OCH 3)Cl+MCl According to Eq. (8), since metal chloride was formed and the loss of chlorine was inhibited in this reaction, the stability of active species was improved. The addition of alkali acetate influences the electronic environment of synergistic Pd–Cu active species because alkali metal is an electron-donating promoter. Furthermore, since the acetate coordinates with Pd or Cu species in place of chlorine anion, and the electronic environment of Pd–Cu active species is improved further, so the activity and stability of the catalyst is increased. 4 Conclusions For the purpose of studying the reaction mechanism of the synthesis of DMC by gas-phase oxidative carbonylation of methanol, a series of supported metal chloride catalysts have been prepared. The characterization and evaluation results suggest that this reaction proceeds according to redox mechanism. Pd2+/Pd0 and Cu2+/Cu+ are proposed to be the active sites of single metal chloride catalysts, respectively. Synergistic effect of bimetallic chloride catalyst increases the catalytic activity markedly. The main reason for catalyst deactivation could be attributed to the loss of chlorine. CH3COOK not only inhibit the loss of chlorine in catalyst and enrich it on the catalyst surface, but also improve the electronic environment of catalyst PdCl2–CuCl2–CH3COOK/a.c., so the catalytic activity and stability increase markedly. Further experimental studies that specifically address the structure of catalyst PdCl2–CuCl2–CH3COOK/a.c. are still needed to completely understand these issues.
