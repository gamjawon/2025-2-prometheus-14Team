Graphical abstract Gold can be deposited as clusters as small as 1.9nm in diameter on carbon materials directly from its precursor compounds by means of deposition reduction and solid grinding methods. These gold clusters showed sharp catalytic activity increase with a decrease in the mean diameters of Au nanoparticles in the range between 1 and 10nm. Carbon materials such as activated carbon and carbon black have long been used as adsorbents, electrodes, and supports for metal catalysts. However, no attempt has yet been reported to deposit Au as small nanoparticles (NPs) on these carbon materials directly from Au precursor compounds. Until now, the most effective way to support Au NPs on activated carbon was to physically mix a carbon support with Au colloids prepared beforehand. Here we report that Au could be deposited as NPs on carbon materials directly from gold precursor compounds by deposition reduction method and by solid grinding method. In particular, the solid grinding of carbons with dimethyl Au(III) acetylacetonate, which has a certain degree of vapor pressure at room temperature, is a simple technique but surprisingly effective to deposit Au NPs with a mean diameter as small as 1.9nm. These highly dispersed Au NPs on carbon supports were tested for glucose oxidation in water with molecular oxygen. A Au/nanoporous carbon (NPC) catalyst which exhibited relatively high catalytic activity has been kinetically studied for comparison with Au/metal oxides catalysts. Keywords Gold nanoparticles Carbon supports Solid grinding Glucose oxidation Kinetic study 1 Introduction Gluconic acid is useful as a food additive, an ingredient for concrete, and raw materials for medicines and biodegradable polymers [1]. The annual production in the world amounts to 60,000tons per year [2]. Currently it is industrially produced by fermentation. However, there remain a few drawbacks: maintenance of enzyme activity is needed, reaction rate is slow [3], and dead microbes and accumulated excretory substances of microbes need to be disposed of [4]. A new route which can solve these problems is to replace enzyme with heterogeneous catalysts. Although many efforts have been made for developing new catalysts for glucose oxidation [5], improvements in catalytic activities are still needed. Glucose oxidation reaction using Au catalysts has been reported by several research groups. Prüße et al. [6,7] reported glucose oxidation using Au catalysts, mainly supported on metal oxides. They reported Au/Al2O3 catalysts with Au NPs as small as 2.8nm (1wt%) and 1.9nm (0.3wt%). Their Au/Al2O3 catalyst (0.3wt%) has achieved MTY (metal time yield on the basis of the total number of metal atoms; molGlucose/molAu/s) of 6.2molGlucose/molAu/s with selectivity of 100% to sodium gluconate. This catalyst also showed a high stability, with no significant decrease in its catalytic activity after 18 batches of glucose oxidation. Glucose oxidation reactions using Au/C catalysts have been originally reported by Rossi et al. [8]. They reported a Au/C catalyst having better catalytic activity than Pt–Pd–Bi/C, Pd–Bi/C and Pt/C catalysts in terms of conversion and TOF (turn over frequency) at pHs of 9.5, 8 and 7. This order of precedence did not change after 4 times of recycling. An advantage of Au/C capable of performing glucose oxidation reaction up to 100% of conversion without controlling pH is also reported. Among catalytic metals Au is superior to other metals [9]. Accordingly, Au NPs supported on various kinds of supports have been actively studied until now. Among them carbon is regarded as an inert support which only slightly affects the catalytic properties of Au NPs [2,8,10]. Carbon materials have many advantages as supports for metal catalysts: they are stable in both acidic and basic environments; they are electrically conductive, leading to applications to electrodes for fuel cells, batteries, and chemical sensors; and they are combustible enough to allow the recovery of catalytic metals. Due to the presence of acidic functional groups such as carboxylic groups on the surfaces of carbon materials, until now, to deposit Au NPs on them, the sol immobilization method has mainly been used, instead of directly depositing Au NPs from Au precursor compounds [2,11–13]. In this work, we have tried to deposit Au NPs on carbon materials directly from Au precursor compounds by deposition reduction method and solid grinding method, which we have recently developed [14,15]. Three different kinds of carbon materials have been chosen as supports for Au NPs: activated carbon (MAXSORB, MSC-30), nanoporous carbon (NPC), and carbon nanohorn (CNH). It has been presumed that activated carbon can trap the reactant glucose in micropores but not Au NPs, while NPC can accommodate Au NPs in mesopores. CNH has a very unique structure at the surfaces and may provide Au NPs sites for homogeneous dispersion. Catalysts prepared by the newly invented methods were tested for the oxidation of glucose in aqueous solution with molecular oxygen. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Activated carbon (MSC-30) was supplied by Kansai Coke and Chemicals Co., Ltd. and had a BET surface area of 3140m2/g and pores mainly smaller than 1nm. Nanoporous carbon (NPC) was purchased from Easy-N., Inc., Korea, and had a BET surface area of 577m2/g and a pore size of 2nm. Carbon nanohorn (CNH) was supplied by Nano Electronics Research Laboratories of NEC and had a BET surface area of 363m2/g. As gold precursors, tetrachloroauric acid (HAuCl4·4H2O) and dimethyl Au(III) acetylacetonate (Me2Au(acac)) were purchased from Kishida Reagents Chemicals Co. Ltd. and Tri Chemical Laboratories Inc., respectively. Bis(ethylenediamine) Au(III) trichloride was prepared according to the procedures described in the literature [16]. Diethyl ether, ethanol, ethylenediamine, sodium citrate and sodium hydroxide, all in reagent grade, were purchased and used as received Molecular sieve 4A 1/16, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA, MW 500, saponified completely, average degree of polymerization: 400–600), poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP, MW30000), sodium borohydride and d-glucose, all in reagent grade, were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. All supports, gold precursors and other reagents were used without further purification. 2.2 Catalyst preparation All gold catalysts were prepared by using Au precursors with amounts corresponding to a theoretical Au loading of 1.0wt% with respect to the weight of carbon supports. 2.2.1 Sol immobilization method (SI) Protective agents (PVA (5mg) for NPC and PVP (4mg) for CNH) were added into the aqueous solution of chloroauric acid (HAuCl4) (0.1–0.4mM) and the mixture was stirred vigorously at 60°C. Gold complex ions were reduced at room temperature by adding the aqueous solution of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) in excess (NaBH4/Au=5mol/mol for NPC, 10mol/mol for CNH) and the colloidal dispersion was stirred vigorously. Then supports (0.8g) which had been dispersed in ethanol beforehand were added into the solution, and were stirred vigorously. The solid was filtrated, washed and dried at 100°C over night and was finally calcined in air at 300°C for 4h. For the MSC-30 support, sodium citrate (sodium citrate/Au=20mol/mol) was used as both protective colloid and reducing agent and Au complex ions were reduced by increasing the temperature to 60°C. 2.2.2 Deposition reduction method (DR) Support materials (0.8g) were dispersed into the solution of bis(ethylenediamine) Au(III) trichloride (0.1mM) in water or ethanol. Because carbon materials are negatively charged in the solution, the cationic complex ion of gold was used. For MSC-30- and NPC-supported catalysts, the aqueous solution of excess NaBH4 (NaBH4/Au=10mol/mol) was added at once at room temperature. The solid was filtrated, washed, dried at 100°C overnight, and finally was calcined in air at 300°C for 4h. For CNH-supported catalysts, NaBH4 was added dropwise at 50°C and the solids were used as catalysts without calcinations. 2.2.3 Solid grinding method (SG) Dimethyl Au(III) acetylacetonate which has a vapor pressure of 1.1Pa at room temperature and the support (0.3g) were ground by using a mortar for 20min or a ball mill (SG-BM). The mixture was calcined in air at 300°C for 4h. In the case of SG-BM, the influence of milling conditions on the catalytic activity was investigated (Fig. 4). 2.3 Characterization of gold catalysts Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations were carried out by using a JEOL JEM-2100F operating at 200kV and a JEOL JEM-3000F operating at 300kV. The latter instrument was also used as a high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM) to observe Au clusters smaller than 2nm in diameter. In principle, the diameters of more than 200 gold NPs were measured. The mean diameters of Au NPs and the standard deviations were estimated according to Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS H 7803, 2005). Inductively-coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) measurements were carried out to measure the actual Au loadings by using a SPECTRO CIROS CCD (RIGAKU). Prior to analysis, NPC and Au/NPC prepared by SG-BM were weighed accurately and then were calcined in air at 800°C for 6h. Gold particles were dissolved with 4ml of aqua regia and then diluted with water to obtain 100ml solution. NPC without Au loading was washed with aqua regia similarly. 2.4 Glucose oxidation Each aqueous solution containing 5wt% of glucose (83ml) was stirred vigorously, while oxygen gas was bubbled at 60 or 120ml/min for 30min. Meantime, the temperature was raised to 50°C or 60°C. The pH was controlled at 9.0, 9.5 or 10.0 by adding 1M NaOH solution. After oxygen bubbling for 30min, 0.030g or 0.015g of catalyst (molGlucose/molAu =16,000 or 32,000) was dispersed in the glucose solution. Under controlled temperature and pH, the reaction rate of glucose oxidation MTY (molGlucose/molAu/s) was calculated from the slope of the straight line for the plots of the amount of NaOH added to keep the pH value against time of duration. For the kinetic study of glucose oxidation over Au/NPC catalyst prepared by SG-BM, rate dependencies on oxygen and glucose concentration, temperature, and pH were measured under the fundamental conditions of 50°C, pH 9.0, O2 flow rate 120ml/min, molGlucose/molAu =32,000. The reaction solution after glucose oxidation over a Au/NPC catalyst prepared by SG-BM method was analyzed with a high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) (DIONEX ion chromatograph and SHIMADZU LC-6) to determine the selectivity to gluconic acid. 3 Results Among MSC, NPC and CNH supports, Au NPs were the smallest when deposited on NPC by solid grinding using a ball mill. Fig. 1(a) and (b) shows TEM and HAADF-STEM images for Au NPs on NPC. Because HAADF-STEM can distinguish smaller particles owing to the sharper contrast which increased in inverse proportion to the second power of atom number, the size distributions of Au NPs obtained differed between the two techniques as shown in Fig. 2 . The mean diameter and standard deviation of Au particles were measured to be 1.9±0.8nm by HAADF-STEM, whereas they were measured to be 2.6±0.8nm by TEM. This catalyst showed the highest MTY among Au NPs supported on carbon: 17s−1 and also exhibited high selectivity to sodium gluconate, above 98% at 60°C, pH 9.5 after a 100-min run and a very low selectivity of 1.6% to fructose. The reactant glucose that remained was only 0.16%. The actual Au loading obtained by ICP-AES measurements was 1.06 wt%, showing that there was no substantial escape of Au during solid grinding. Table 1 lists the mean diameters of Au particles and MTYs for different kinds of carbon supports and different preparation methods. For MSC-30 and NPC, liquid phase preparation methods, i.e., SI and DR, produced Au particles larger than 10nm. These large Au particles were less active, resulting in MTYs lower than 0.4molGlucose/molAu/s in glucose oxidation. On the other hand, solid phase preparation methods, i.e., SG using a mortar or a ball mill, produced Au NPs smaller than 10nm. For CNH, all the three preparation methods could disperse Au as NPs smaller than 10nm and led to MTYs above 5molGlucose/molAu/s. Gold catalysts supported by any of the three carbons show appreciably high catalytic activities with MTYs above 2molGlucose/molAu/s when Au was deposited as NPs smaller than 10nm. Fig. 3 shows the relationship between MTY and the diameter of Au NPs. The MTY value sharply increased as the diameter of Au NPs decreased from 10nm, indicating that Au NPs larger than 10nm were inactive for glucose oxidation (solid line). Fig. 4 shows that the catalytic activities of Au/NPC prepared by the SG-BM method were appreciably dependent on the milling conditions, such as the size and the number of balls, rotation speeds, and period of grinding (Fig. 4). Optimum conditions were 2mm in the ball size, 300rpm in the rotation speed, and 30min in the grinding time. The dependence of reaction rate on the concentration of oxygen dissolved in the aqueous solution of glucose was investigated by stopping the bubbling of oxygen gas and by measuring the concentration of oxygen dissolved by using a dissolved oxygen meter before adding the catalyst powder. The initial oxygen concentrations were changed by adjusting the timing of adding the catalyst after the oxygen bubbling was stopped. Fig. 5(a) shows that the reaction rate is independent of the concentrations of oxygen dissolved in glucose solution. The reaction rates obtained under different rates of oxygen flow were 1st order to oxygen flow rate below 60ml/min and leveled off to 0.4th order above 60ml/min (Fig. 5(b)). Fig. 6 shows that the initial reaction rate markedly increases with an increase in glucose concentration in the 6th order in the range of 3–5.4wt%. Above 5.4wt%, the initial reaction rate increase leveled off and became 0.4th order to the initial concentration of glucose. Fig. 7 shows Arrhenius plots for the reaction at three different pHs (9.0, 9.5, and 10.0) of the glucose aqueous solution. The activation energy decreased with a decrease in pH and was 96, 80, and 68kJ/mol for pHs 10.0, 9.5, and 9.0, respectively. 4 Discussion 4.1 Influence of carbon materials as supports Methods that are effective to deposit Au as NPs differ depending on the kinds of carbon materials (Table 1). For MSC and NPC, only the SG method could deposit Au as NPs smaller than 10nm, whereas SI, DR, and SG methods are all effective to deposit Au NPs on CNH. Once Au is deposited as NPs smaller than 10nm, they exhibit appreciably high catalytic activity for glucose oxidation regardless of the methods of Au deposition and the kinds of carbon supports. Whereas TOF (turnover frequency; molGlucose/molSurfaceAu/s) at 60°C and at pH 9.0 is extremely high, around 60s−1 when Au is supported on metal oxides such as ZrO2 and Al2O3 [15], TOF values obtained with Au NPs smaller than 3nm deposited on carbons are about one-third of those of Au NPs on selected metal oxides. 4.2 Size effect of gold particles As shown in Fig. 3, as a whole, MTY rises very rapidly as Au clusters become smaller, especially below 8nm, irrespective of the kinds of carbon supports. In the present work, MTY by Au supported on carbons depends on the diameter of Au particles more strongly than 1st order of the reciprocal of Au diameters which is closer to our results of Au/metal oxides [15] than to the results reported by Rossi et al. [17]. Turnover frequencies increase very sharply as the diameters become smaller when metal oxides are used as supports such as ZrO2 and Al2O3 [15]. Rossi et al. reported a proportional relationship between initial specific molar activity and the inverse of the mean diameter of Au free colloids in the range of diameter from 2 to 7nm, which means that the rate of reaction is in proportion to the surface area of Au [17]. 4.3 Kinetic behavior of Au/NPC Glucose oxidation over Au/NPC is the 6th order to the initial glucose concentration up to 5wt% and then reaches the 0.8th order above 5wt% (Fig. 6). This rate dependency did not exactly meet with results from other previous works, which reported that the rate was 0.4th order to the initial glucose concentration in the range of 0.05–0.1M [15,18]. One of the reasons of the surprisingly strong dependency of reaction rate on glucose concentration may be the weakness of NPC in absorbing glucose. When solutions of 1M glucose were treated with NPC and ZrO2 at 50°C for 2.5h, ZrO2 absorbed 1.5 times as much glucose as NPC did. The rate of glucose oxidation was the 1st order to the oxygen flow rate up to 60ml/min (Fig. 5(b)). On the other hand, when glucose oxidation reactions were performed with oxygen dissolved prior to the start of the reaction, the reactions proceeded very slowly, suggesting that the rates of reaction of glucose with oxygen dissolved are very low (Fig. 5(a)). The values of “dissolved oxygen concentration” were expedient, because the dissolved oxygen meter detected oxygen bubbles which were invisible and indicated higher concentrations than the actual saturated concentration, which is 8mg/l at room temperature and lower at higher temperatures. Since the saturation solubility is stable at a given temperature, further bubbling of oxygen does not increase the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the solution. Hence, the only difference in reaction conditions between solutions with and without bubbling oxygen is the existence of large numbers of oxygen bubbles. Therefore, this result suggests that the co-existence of large numbers of oxygen bubbles is very important. Among three possible rate-determining steps, O2 dissolution, reaction of glucose with O2 dissolved in the solution, and the reaction of glucose with O2 bubbles, the reaction of glucose with O2 bubbles is the most likely. This may explain why the catalyst reported by Rossi et al. achieved a very high TOF of 42molGlucose/molSurfaceAu/s by stirring with a turbine, although they obtained an MTY of 3.7molGlucose/molAu/s by stirring with a magnetic stirrer [19] (Table 2 ). The turbine may produce more oxygen bubbles and would enable them to contact with Au surfaces and glucose a lot more frequently. The apparent activation energies (E a) for glucose oxidation at three different pHs show that the glucose oxidation rate over Au/NPC catalyst depends on pHs, as well as on Au sizes. The values of Ea for Au/NPC catalysts are 68, 80, and 96kJ/mol at pHs of 9.0, 9.5, and 10.0, respectively. These values are much larger than 27 and 53kJ/mol over Au/Al2O3 and Au/ZrO2, respectively, at pH 9.0. This difference may be caused by the difference in the absorption abilities of supports for glucose. When the temperature is high, NPC does not absorb glucose as much as metal oxides do, which means that the glucose concentration in the solution can be kept high, leading to high MTYs at high temperatures. Although it is not unusual that the rate of reaction increases with increase in pH and temperature, these conditions affect especially strongly for Au/NPC, which has high E as at high pHs. At high temperatures and at high pHs, Au/carbons tend to be superior to Au/metal oxides. 5 Conclusions Gold could be deposited as small nanoparticles (NPs) with diameters below 10nm on porous carbon supports directly from Au precursor compounds by using a deposition reduction method and a solid grinding method. The catalytic properties of Au NPs deposited on MSC-30 (activated carbon), NPC (nanoporous carbon), and CNH (carbon nanohorn) for glucose oxidation in aqueous solution can be summarized as follows. (1) The MTY (metal time yield, molGlucose/molAu/s) increases sharply as the diameter of Au NPs becomes smaller than 10nm. (2) Over Au/NPC catalysts, the reaction rate of glucose oxidation was the 6th order to glucose concentration up to 5wt% and was the 1st order to oxygen flow rate up to 60ml/min. Reaction orders with respect to glucose were much larger over Au/carbon catalysts than over Au/metal oxide catalysts. (3) The apparent activation energies increased with an increase in the pH of the reaction solution from 68kJ/mol at pH 9.0 to 96kJ/mol at pH 10.0, indicating that, over Au NPs deposited on carbon supports, glucose oxidation is noticeably enhanced at higher pH and higher temperature.
