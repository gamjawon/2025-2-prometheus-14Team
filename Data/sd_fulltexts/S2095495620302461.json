The low sulfur utilization and fast capacity fading resulting from the sluggish redox reaction and abominable polysulfides shuttle greatly hinder the practical applications of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Herein, we develop a facile “in-situ growth” method to decorate ultra-small Mo2C nanoparticles (US-Mo2C) on the surface of Ketjen Black (KB) to functionalize the commercial polypropylene (PP) separators, which can accelerate the redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides conversion and effectively increase the utilization of sulfur for Li-S batteries. Importantly, the US-Mo2C nanoparticles have abundant sites for chemical adsorption towards polysulfides and the conductive carbon networks of KB have cross-linked pore channels, which can promote electron transport and provide physical barrier and volume expansion space for polysulfides. Due to the combined effects of the US-Mo2C and KB, Li-S cells employing the multifunctional PP separators modified with KB/US-Mo2C composite (KB/US-Mo2C@PP) exhibit a high specific capacity (1212.8 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C), and maintain a reversible capacity of 1053.3 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles. More importantly, the KB/US-Mo2C@PP cells with higher sulfur mass loading of 4.9 mg cm−2 have superb areal capacity of 2.3 mAh cm−2. This work offers a novel and promising perspective for high-performance Li-S batteries from both the shuttle effect and the complex polysulfides conversion. Graphical abstract An in-situ growth strategy is developed to construct a multifunctional polypropylene separator by decorating the ultra-small Mo2C nanoparticles on the Ketjen Black matrix, thus effectively improving polysulfides chemisorption and redox kinetics for lithium-sulfur batteries. Image, graphical abstract Keywords in-situ growth Ultra-small Mo2C Catalytic effect Chemisorption Multifunctional separator Lithium-sulfur batteries 1 Introduction Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery is considered as one of the most promising energy storage systems due to the ultra-high energy density (2600 Wh kg−1) and low cost of active substance (sulfur), as well as the environmental friendliness [1–3]. However, the commercial application of Li-S batteries is greatly limited by short cycle life, low Coulombic efficiency, and low utilization of sulfur [4,5]. The fundamental reason is that sulfur cathode is gradually reduced to lithium polysulfide (LiPS) such as Li2S6, Li2S4, and Li2S2/Li2S during the discharge process [6–8]. Long-chain polysulfides (Li2S x , 4≤x≤8) can dissolve into electrolyte and reach the Li anode through the large holes of Celgard separator, leading to the anode surface corrosion and loss of active substances [1,9,10]. To address these issues, researchers have adopted various strategies such as cathode engineering [11–15], electrolyte modification [16–18], and configuration of interlayers or functional separators [19–21] to suppress the shuttle effect of polysulfides. Among these, multifunction of separator has been proved to be a convenient and efficacious strategy for high-performance Li-S batteries through porous material adsorption [22,23], chemical bonding adsorption [24,25] and charge repulsion [26–28]. Up to now, various materials with electrochemical catalytic function have been introduced into the functionalized separators for the property improvement of Li-S batteries. Xu et al. proposed a Pt@Ni core-shell bimetallic catalyst, which can activate Li2S2/Li2S through facilitating the conversion from Li-S-Li to Ni-S-Li through the electromigration from Ni to Pt and oxidize Li2S2/Li2S into chain polysulfide (Li2S x , 4≤x≤8) on account of the Ni-S-Li [29]. Zhang's group constructed an electrolyte/CoSe2/Graphene multifunctional three-phase interface to regulate the electrochemical redox reactions of polysulfides [30]. Especially, molybdenum carbide is expected to inhibit the shuttle effect and accelerate the redox kinetic conversion of polysulfides due to its high catalytic activity for Li2S and chemisorption for polysulfides in Li-S batteries [31]. However, large particle size and poor conductivity are the major obstacles to the application of molybdenum carbide [32,33]. Therefore, refining the particle size of molybdenum carbide and improving its conductivity are theoretically beneficial to the application of molybdenum carbide in Li-S batteries. Herein, we developed a simple but efficient “in-situ growth” strategy to construct a multifunctional polypropylene (PP) separator by decorating the ultra-small Mo2C nanoparticles on the Ketjen Black matrix (designated as KB/US-Mo2C@PP). The resulting US-Mo2C not only provides abundant sites for sufficient adsorption for polysulfides through Mo-S bonding, but also displays excellent catalytic function through the sufficient contact between Mo2C nanoparticles and polysulfides, accelerating the polysulfides conversion and facilitates the reuse of captured polysulfides. Furthermore, the rich conductive carbon networks of KB frames can improve the conductivity of lithium ions and electrons. Due to the combined effects of ultra-small Mo2C nanoparticles and KB, Li-S cells with KB/US-Mo2C@PP separators show high specific capacity and excellent cycle stability. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of KB/US-Mo2C composite The surface of KB ECP-600JD (Lion Specialty Chemicals Co. Ltd.) was firstly modified by cationic surfactant cetyltriethylammnonium bromide (CTAB, Aladdin, 99.0%): 400 mg CTAB was added to 80 mL DI water containing 100 mg KB. The mixed solution was sonicated at room temperature for 30 min, and then magnetically stirred for 12 h in a 35 °C water bath environment. Next, 1 g (NH4)2MoO4 (Macklin, AR) was added to the mixed solution and stirred for 12 h to achieve sufficient and uniform adsorption of MoO4 2− on the KB surface by positive charge sites. The centrifuged product was washed three times with deionized water and dried at 60 °C for 12 h to obtain the precursor. The precursor was incubated at 550 °C (10 °C min−1) for 1 h and 800 °C (5 °C min−1) for 4 h under 10% hydrogen-argon atmosphere to obtain KB/US-Mo2C composite. It was named as 1-10# KB/Mo2C according to the mass ratio of KB and (NH4)2MoO4. 1-5# KB/US-Mo2C and 1-15# KB/US-Mo2C were prepared as control groups according to the same synthesis method. 2.2 Preparation of KB/US-Mo2C@PP separator 80% KB/US-Mo2C composite, 10% polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and 10% carbon black were dispersed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and stirred to form slurry. The slurry was casted on the Celgard 2400 separators (PP) and then dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h. The dried KB/US-Mo2C@PP separator was cut into small discs of 19 mm and the areal loading of KB/US-Mo2C is about 1.3 mg cm−2. KB@PP separators were also prepared by the same process. 2.3 Preparation of KB/S cathode 380 mg sublimed sulfur (≥ 99.98%, Sigma-Aldrich) and 20 mg KB were mixed and sealed in a vacuum glass tube. The glass tube was heated at 155 °C for 12 h to obtain KB/S composite. 400 mg KB/S composite, 50 mg LA133 (N-lauryl acrylate) binder and 50 mg carbon black were dispersed in an aqueous solution of N-propanol and then stirred overnight to obtain slurry. The slurry was coated on a carbon-coated aluminum foil with doctor blade method and dried under vacuum at 60 °C overnight. The sulfur loading of KB/S cathodes was about 1.9–2 mg cm−2. The higher sulfur loading cathodes of 3.2 mg cm−2 and 4.9 mg cm−2 were also prepared by the same process. 2.4 Preparation of Li2S6 solution Sublimed sulfur and Li2S (Macklin, AR) with a molar ratio of 5:1 were dispersed in a mixed solvent of 1, 3-dioxolane (DOL) and dimethoxymethane (DME) (v/v = 1/1). Followed by vigorously stirring at 50 °C for 24 h, the Li2S6 solution was obtained. 2.5 Assembly and measurement of symmetric cells 45 mg KB/US-Mo2C composite and 5 mg PVDF were dispersed in NMP solvent and stirred for 12 h to form slurry, and were coated on carbon-coated aluminum foil. The KB/US-Mo2C areal loading is 0.1 mg cm−2. Working and counter electrodes used two identical electrodes to assemble 2032-type coin cell. CV measurement of symmetric cells was performed at different scan rates of 50–2000 mV s−1 with a voltage window of -1 to 1 V. 2.6 Material characterization The microscopic morphologies of KB/US-Mo2C were observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4800) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL-2100F). The crystalline structures of KB/US-Mo2C and KB were observed by a Bruker / D8 Focus diffractometer (Germany). The specific surface area and pore structure of KB/US-Mo2C and KB were measured at 77 K using a Micromeritics TriStar II 3020 analyzer. The chemical compositions and valence states were analyzed on a Thermo ESCALAB 250 spectrometer (XPS). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out under air atmosphere with the heating rate of 10 °C min−1 on a TA Instrument Q600 analyzer. 2.7 Electrochemical measurements KB/S cathodes, modified PP separators, and lithium foils anodes were assembled as 2032-type coin cells. The electrolyte is composed of 1M lithium bis (trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI) in 1, 3-dioxolane (DOL) and 1, 2-dimethoxyethane (DME) (v/v = 1/1), as well as 2 wt% LiNO3. The added amount of electrolyte was 70 μL. LAND (CT2001C) cell test system was used to perform the galvanostatic charge and discharge tests in a voltage range of 1.7–2.8 V. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed on the CHI760 electrochemical workstation. The scan rate of CV was 0.1 mV s−1 and the potential window of it was 1.7 to 2.8 V. EIS was recorded in the frequency range between 0.01 Hz and 100 kHz. 3 Results and discussions As shown in Fig. 1 (a), the Ketjen Black decorated with ultra-small Mo2C nanoparticles (KB/US-Mo2C) was synthesized through a facile “in-situ growth” approach. In details, the preparation of KB/US-Mo2C involves two steps: simple surface positive charge modification and sequent annealing process. Firstly, the surface of KB was modified by cationic surfactant (CTAB) to provide abundant active sites for uniform adsorption of molybdate. Then, the ultra-small Mo2C nanoparticles were in-situ grown on the surface of KB after heating in 10% H2/Ar atmosphere [34,35]. When the KB/US-Mo2C was coated on the surface of the PP separator in Li-S cells (Fig. 1(b) and 1(c)), the shuttle effect would be greatly suppressed and the utilization rate of the active substance would be improved because of the combined effects of the ultra-small Mo2C and KB (Fig. 1(d)). As shown in Fig. 2(a,b), the KB/US-Mo2C composite has a well-defined hinge-like network structure, which belonged to the conductive framework of KB. In addition, no large Mo2C particles were found in the KB/US-Mo2C composite. As shown in Fig. 2(c), SEM elemental mapping images reveal the matched spatial distributions of C and Mo elements, confirming the uniform distribution of Mo2C nanoparticles on the KB matrix. From the TEM images, the Mo2C nanoparticles were uniformly distributed on the KB (Fig. 2(d)) and the particle size of them were about 5–10 nm. HR-TEM image of KB/US-Mo2C composite in Fig. 2(e) shows the distinct lattice fringes of Mo2C (002) planes with a lattice spacing of 0.235 nm. The crystal phases of the synthesized KB/US-Mo2C composite were evaluated through X-ray diffraction analysis. The XRD pattern of KB/US-Mo2C (Fig. 3 (a)) shows that eight characteristic peaks at 34°, 38°, 39°, 52°, 62°, 70°, 75° and 76° are assigned to (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (200) and (112) crystal planes, respectively, which are consistent with the Mo2C phase (JCPDS:35-0787). Besides, the full width at half maxima (FWHM) of KB/US-Mo2C composite is larger than that of most of reported work (Table S1), indicating that the crystallite size of Mo2C nanoparticles in KB/US-Mo2C composite is ultra-small [32,36,37]. The average size of Mo2C nanoparticles in KB/US-Mo2C composite can be calculated to be 7.2 nm through Scherrer formula, which is consistent with the direct observation of HRTEM. It is worth noting that the peak at 21° moved slightly to the small angle direction after loading of Mo2C. This phenomenon is attributed to the nitrogen doping in the carbon lattice [38], which was derived from the decomposition of CTAB on the KB surface. Raman spectra of pristine KB and KB/US-Mo2C composite were recorded to demonstrate the existence of graphite carbon in the KB/US-Mo2C composite. As shown in Fig. 3(b), two different peaks at 1350 cm−1 and 1598 cm−1 correspond to the D and G bands of the disordered graphite carbon, respectively [39]. The D/G ratio (1.14) of KB/US-Mo2C composite is smaller than that (1.45) of pristine KB, indicating the higher degree of graphitization after annealing which is beneficial to the electronic transmission. To further evaluate the relative content of Mo2C components in KB/US-Mo2C composite, thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was carried out in air atmosphere. As shown in Fig. S1, the KB/US-Mo2C composite experienced three stages of weight loss (moisture evaporation), weight gain (Mo2C oxidization to MoO3) and weight loss (burned out of KB). According to the reaction formula (Mo2C + 4O2 = 2MoO3 + CO2), the Mo2C content in the KB/US-Mo2C composite was calculated about 57 wt% [40]. As shown in Fig. 3(c), KB/US-Mo2C composite shows an IV isotherm behavior with a conspicuous H3 hysteresis loop, revealing the existence of mesoporous structure. The pore size distribution curve (inset of Fig. 3(c)) shows that the average mesopore size of KB/US-Mo2C is 2.7 nm. Moreover, the specific surface area and pore volume of KB/US-Mo2C composite are 265.07 m2 g−1 and 0.44 cm3 g−1, respectively. The elementary composition and chemical valence of KB/US-Mo2C composite were validated through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The survey XPS spectrum of KB/US-Mo2C composite in Fig. S3 confirms the presence of C, Mo, O and N elements. In the high-resolution Mo 3d spectrum (Fig. 3(d)), the peaks at 228.7 eV and 231.6 eV belong to the characteristic doublets of the Mo2+ state of Mo2C. For the peaks of Mo4+ (229.8 eV and 233.5 eV) and Mo6+ (232.6 eV and 235.8 eV), tetravalent and hexavalent Mo theoretically derived from MoO2 and MoO3 due to the surface oxidation of Mo2C exposed to air [40,41]. Noticeably, no crystal peaks of MoO2 and MoO3 were found in the XRD pattern (Fig. 3(a)), suggesting the formation of amorphous MoO x structure. It is noted that, due to the limited detection depth of XPS analysis, the content of Mo2C is less than the content of MoO2 and MoO3 since only the surface of Mo2C was oxidized to amorphous MoO x in the air [40]. As reported previously [42], MoO2 partially loses crystallinity or changes to an amorphous structure during the charge and discharge process and more Li can be easily removed/inserted from/into the amorphous MoO x . In addition, the oxidation reaction can induce a large number of vacancy defect, which is favorable for the conduction of electrons. Thus, the amorphous MoO x can facilitate the electrons and Li ions transport, thus promoting fast reaction kinetics. In addition, the amorphous MoO x can also contributes to long-term cycling stability because of its strain relaxation capacity [43]. In the high-resolution C 1s spectrum (Fig. S4), the peak at 284.6 eV corresponding to C-C is the Eg vibration of the sp 2-bonded carbon [44]. The occurrence of C-N peak at 285.9 eV in the high-resolution C 1s spectrum is owing to residual trace elements of CTAB. The KB/US-Mo2C coated PP (KB/US-Mo2C@PP) separator was fabricated by homogeneously coating KB/US-Mo2C on the surface of PP separator (Fig. 4 (a)). The cross-sectional view SEM image of KB/US-Mo2C@PP separator in Fig. 4(b) shows that the KB/US-Mo2C closely coated on the PP separator with the thickness of 15.6 μm. The mass loading of KB/US-Mo2C composite is calculated to be 1.3 mg cm−2. Moreover, the top view SEM and corresponding mapping images show the homogeneous distribution of KB/US-Mo2C on the PP separator (Figs. 4(c) and 4(d)). To explore the catalytic effect of KB/US-Mo2C composite for Li-S batteries, the redox reaction kinetics was probed through CV analysis of symmetric cells with Li2S6 electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 5 (a), the current density of KB/US-Mo2C was higher than that of KB with the scan rate of 2000 mV s−1, indicating that Mo2C can enhance the kinetics conversion between liquid polysulfides. Generally, the diffusion of active phases lags far behind their redox exhaustion at a rapid scan rate. In fact, the CV profile of KB/US-Mo2C at a fast scan rate of 2000 mV s−1 still remained clearly reduction and oxidation peaks, indicating the ultrafast catalytic redox reactions of soluble lithium polysulfides. At different scan rates from 50 to 2000 mV s−1, redox current increases with the increasing of scan rate (Fig. S5), further demonstrating the electrochemical catalytic ability of the KB/US-Mo2C composite. These results are mainly attributed to the decoration of ultra-small Mo2C nanoparticles on the KB conductive matrix, which can provide a rich three-phase interface with combined effects of chemisorption, electrical conductivity and catalysis effect to promote rapid conversion of polysulfides [30,45]. In addition, the lowest decomposition voltage of KB/Mo2C@PP was observed from the detail area of the 60th discharge-charge profile (Fig. S6), confirming the activation function of Mo2C on Li2S. Consequently, the possible catalytic function of Mo2C nanoparticles can be attributed to the following two aspects: 1) one is the enhancement on the conversion kinetics of soluble polysulfides (Li2S4, Li2S6); 2) the other is the activation and reuse of insoluble polysulfides (Li2S/Li2S2). To further investigate the effect of KB/US-Mo2C@PP separator on improving the electrochemical performances of Li-S batteries, coin cells were assembled with KB/S cathodes, lithium foils and varied modified PP separators. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the redox peaks centered can be observed from CV curves of the cells equipping KB/US-Mo2C@PP, KB@PP and PP separator, which are the typical characteristics of electrochemical reactions in Li-S cells. Compared to the redox peaks of PP (1.96 and 2.27 V) and KB@PP (2.01 and 2.25 V), the KB/US-Mo2C@PP has higher peak potentials (2.02 and 2.29 V) and significantly elevated currents, revealing the valid limitation and remarkable accelerated polysulfide conversion kinetics. Moreover, in comparison to the KB@PP (2.41 V) and PP (2.44 V), the lower potential (2.39 V) and the larger area of oxidation peak were observed, which are the results of the accelerated dissolution and oxidation reaction kinetics of Li2S2/Li2S. In addition, peak spacing between oxidation peak and low potential reduction peak evaluate the electrochemical polarization of electrode material [46]. Consequently, the Li-S cell with KB/US-Mo2C@PP has the smallest electrochemical polarization, which is also demonstrated in the comparison chart of the 60th charge and discharge profiles (Fig. S6) [47]. These results confirm that the KB/US-Mo2C coating has the distinct function on reducing electrochemical polarization and accelerating redox kinetics. The cycling performances of Li-S cells with KB/Mo2C@PP, KB@PP and PP separators at 0.2 C (1 C = 1675 mAh g−1) for 100 cycles were recorded (Fig. 5(c)). The cell equipping PP separator delivered a low initial specific capacity of 657.7 mAh g−1, and decayed to 475.2 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles, and the capacity retention rate is calculated to be only 72.25%. This poor cycling performance can be attributed to the weak conductivity of PP separator and the lack of conductive paths inside the cell. On the other hand, the heterogeneous deposition of Li2S2/Li2S can exacerbates the deterioration of conductivity and the irreversible loss of active substances. Besides, the cell equipping KB@PP separator had a long activation process at the beginning of the cycle and maintained a reversible capacity of 836.2 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles, suggesting that the KB coating has a limited impact on cycling performance. It is noted that the long activation process is attributed to the redistribution of active substance in the KB network and the reactivation of lithium sulfide formed on the lithium anode [48]. In contrast, the Li-S cell with KB/US-Mo2C@PP separator delivered an initial specific capacity of 1212.8 mAh g−1, and maintained a reversible capacity of 1053.3 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles. The remarkable improvement of cycle capacity and cycle stability is due to the combined effects of Mo2C and KB. The charge and discharge profiles of KB/US-Mo2C@PP (Fig. S7) show that the lower platform is very flat, indicating the uniform deposition of Li2S2/Li2S. The rate capabilities of Li-S cells with KB/US-Mo2C@PP, KB@PP and PP separators were further studied at different current rates of 0.1 C, 0.2 C, 0.5 C, 1 C, 2 C (Fig. 5(d) and 5(e)). The cell with KB/US-Mo2C@PP separator exhibited reversible specific capacities of 1392, 1113, 892, 791.1 and 682.6 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C, 0.2 C, 0.5 C, 1 C and 2 C, respectively. When the charge-discharge rate returned to 0.5 C, the reversible specific capacity recovered to 865.5 mAh g−1, which reflects the effectiveness and stability of KB/US-Mo2C@PP separator. In contrast, the Li-S cells with KB@PP and PP separators have lower reversible capacity at all current rates. The Li-S cell with KB/US-Mo2C@PP separator delivered an initial specific capacity of 957.9 mAh g−1 after being activated by a small current density of 0.1 C and maintained a reversible specific capacity of 407.5 mAh g−1 at 1 C after 1500 cycles (Fig. 5(g)). And the average capacity decay rate per cycle is only 0.038%, reflecting the excellent cycle performance of the KB/US-Mo2C@PP cell, which is better than those of other reported composite separators (Table S2). The internal resistance of cells equipping KB/US-Mo2C@PP, KB@PP and PP separator before and after cycling was investigated by EIS measurement (Fig. S8). It is illustrated that the introduction of conductive KB matrix greatly improves the poor conductivity of Mo2C. With the gradual activation in the process of charge and discharge, the electrical contact is improved, and the charge transfer resistance experience a significant decrease. After cycles, the charge transfer resistance of KB/US-Mo2C@PP was less than that of KB@PP, which is the result of the formation of Li2S insulating layer in KB@PP cell [49], and further proves the importance of ultra-small Mo2C nanoparticles on the activation of insoluble Li2S/Li2S2. Considering the importance of the high-sulfur-loading cathode in practical applications, the cycle performance of cells with higher sulfur loading cathodes of 3.2 mg cm−2 and 4.9 mg cm−2 at 0.2 C for 150 cycles were tested. As shown in Fig. 5(f), the cell with sulfur loading cathode of 3.2 mg cm−2 delivered an initial specific capacity of 1260.5 mAh g−1 and maintained a reversible specific capacity of 631.5 mAh g−1 after 150 cycles. More interestingly, the cell with a higher sulfur loading cathode of 4.9 mg cm−2 has an excessively long initial activation period and still has a reversible specific capacity of 502 mAh g−1 after 150 cycles. To further confirm the key role of Mo2C in the cells, the electrochemical performance of the KB/US-Mo2C@PP separator with different mass ratios of Mo2C and KB was investigated (Fig. S9). 1-10# KB/US-Mo2C has a relatively higher cycle capacity and lower capacity decay rate due to the combined effects of the conductivity, electrochemical catalysis and adsorption capacity. On one hand, the ultra-small Mo2C nanoparticles provide abundant chemical adsorption and catalytic functional sites; on the other hand, the KB conductive matrix provides a conductive network with physical barrier adsorption function. To understand the effect of KB/US-Mo2C@PP separator on the inhibition of polysulfides shuttle, KB/US-Mo2C@PP separator was disassembled from a cycled cell at 0.2 C for 10 times (charged to 2.8 V) for XPS characterization (Fig. S3). High-resolution Mo 3d spectrum of the KB/US-Mo2C@PP separator after 10 cycles (Fig. 6 (a)) is significantly different from that of original KB/US-Mo2C composite (Fig. 3(b)). The main peaks at 228.7 eV and 229.8 eV corresponding to Mo2+ and Mo4+ disappeared, which is due to the fact that Mo2+ and Mo4+ on the positive side were oxidized to Mo6+ by migrating the electrons inside the cell to the negative side during the charging process. In addition, the combined energy of Mo6+ 3d 5/2 and Mo6+ 3d 3/2 is slightly increased relative to the raw material, which may be attributed to the reduction of MoO x during the final charging to 2.8 V before the cell was disassembled. The peak of Mo 3d 5/2 at 232.4 eV is higher than the binding energy of Mo 3d 5/2 in MoS2 due to the asymmetric environment and the electronic effect of the surface of the Mo atom assigned to S-Mo2C [47]. In the high-resolution S 2p spectrum (Fig. 6b), the peaks at 164.3 eV and 165.9 eV are the S-S overlap bands of the sulfur element, and the peaks at 169.3 eV and 170.3 eV are attributed to SO3 2− decomposed by the electrolyte, and the peak of 170.9 eV correspond to sulfate substances oxidized on the sulfur surface during the internal oxidation-reduction reaction [36,50]. Besides, the content of SO3 2− was higher than that of sulfate (S-O) and S8, suggesting that the main form of S 2p was SO3 2− decomposed by the electrolyte and residual sulfate after only 10 cycles. It is worth noting that the Li-S peak (near 162.8 eV) was not observed, which reflects the promotion effect of KB/US-Mo2C composite on the polysulfides conversion (Li2S2/Li2S→Li2S x , (4≤x≤8)→S8) and proves that the KB/US-Mo2C@PP separator greatly improves the utilization of active substances. Furthermore, separators and lithium sheets were disassembled from cells equipped with PP separator and KB/US-Mo2C@PP separator cycled for 200 times at 0.2 C. Digital photos (insert) show that the surface of PP separator has obvious yellow matter since that the soluble polysulfides were dissolved in electrolyte and remained on the surface of the separator. On the contrary, no visible sulphur spots were found on the surface of KB/US-Mo2C@PP separator, suggesting the super-adsorption ability of the KB/US-Mo2C coating for polysulfides [51]. SEM and mappings images (Figs. 6(c) and S10) further confirm the inference of macroscopic phenomena. In details, PP separator presents polysulfides deposition with the particle size of more than 100 μm and the direct contact with the insulated PP separator, indicating the complete loss of active substances. In contrast, the KB/US-Mo2C coating still maintains a flat surface and the polysulfides is distributed in the interior of the KB/US-Mo2C coating (Figs. 7(d) and S11), indicating that there is no obvious polysulfides bulk deposition and active substances loss. Similar results were also observed on the dismantled lithium sheets (Fig. 6(e) and 6(f)). SEM images show that the lithium sheet of KB/US-Mo2C@PP cell has a relatively smooth and flat microscopic surface, while the lithium sheet of PP cell displays extremely rough surface with a massive block and fibrous products. This can be caused by the reaction deposition of polysulfides on the lithium anode surface that shuttled to the lithium anode. Consequently, the KB/US-Mo2C@PP separator can provide sufficient adsorption barrier on polysulfides to suppress the shuttle effect in Li-S batteries. 4 Conclusions In summary, we have developed a simple “in-situ growth” strategy to prepare KB/US-Mo2C@PP separator with unique catalysis ability for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries by enhancing the polysulfides chemisorption and the redox kinetic. It is demonstrated that KB/US-Mo2C composite could restrain the shuttle effect and accelerate the conversion of polysulfides. Besides, the KB/US-Mo2C composite could provide abundant Li2S binding sites contributing to the Li2S nucleating and growing homogeneously on the matrix. As a result, the Li-S cells containing a PP separator functionalized with KB/US-Mo2C composite delivered high reversible specific capacity and good cycling performance. This work offers a novel perspective for the construction of high-performance Li-S batteries by improving the shuttle effect and the complex polysulfides conversions.

        "dc:description": "The low sulfur utilization and fast capacity fading resulting from the sluggish redox reaction and abominable polysulfides shuttle greatly hinder the practical applications of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Herein, we develop a facile “in-situ growth” method to decorate ultra-small Mo2C nanoparticles (US-Mo2C) on the surface of Ketjen Black (KB) to functionalize the commercial polypropylene (PP) separators, which can accelerate the redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides conversion and effectively increase the utilization of sulfur for Li-S batteries. Importantly, the US-Mo2C nanoparticles have abundant sites for chemical adsorption towards polysulfides and the conductive carbon networks of KB have cross-linked pore channels, which can promote electron transport and provide physical barrier and volume expansion space for polysulfides. Due to the combined effects of the US-Mo2C and KB, Li-S cells employing the multifunctional PP separators modified with KB/US-Mo2C composite (KB/US-Mo2C@PP) exhibit a high specific capacity (1212.8 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C), and maintain a reversible capacity of 1053.3 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles. More importantly, the KB/US-Mo2C@PP cells with higher sulfur mass loading of 4.9 mg cm−2 have superb areal capacity of 2.3 mAh cm−2. This work offers a novel and promising perspective for high-performance Li-S batteries from both the shuttle effect and the complex polysulfides conversion.",
