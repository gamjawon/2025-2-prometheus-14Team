The TPR patterns showed two well-defined peaks with maxima between 250-350 and 600- 650. The first one (peak I) corresponds to two contributions: (i) the one step reduction (Cu2+ to Cu of a low interacted species (Si), and (ii) the partial reduction (Cu2+ to Cu1+) of a highly dispersed and surface interacted species ($2). The second TPR peak (peak lI) observed at a higher temperature corresponds to the second step reduction (Cu1+ to Cu of the $2 species. In addition, it has been found out that Cuand not Cu2+ is the active site for methanol dehydrogenation to methyl formate. ~c, 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Characterization of Cu/SiO2 catalysts prepared by ion exchange for methanol dehydrogenation E.D. Guerreiro O.F. Gorriz J.B. Rivarola L.A.

A series of copper on silica catalysts prepared by using the ion exchange methods with copper loading between 0.45 and 3 wt% have been studied by means of different techniques such as TPR, EPR, XANES, XRD, XRF, BET and methanol dehydrogenation reaction. The TPR patterns showed two well-defined peaks with maxima between 250–350°C and 600–650°C. The first one (peak I) corresponds to two contributions: (i) the one step reduction (Cu2+ to Cu0) of a low interacted species (S1), and (ii) the partial reduction (Cu2+ to Cu1+) of a highly dispersed and surface interacted species (S2). The second TPR peak (peak II) observed at a higher temperature corresponds to the second step reduction (Cu1+ to Cu0) of the S2 species. In addition, it has been found out that Cu0 and not Cu2+ is the active site for methanol dehydrogenation to methyl formate.

        "dc:description": "A series of copper on silica catalysts prepared by using the ion exchange methods with copper loading between 0.45 and 3 wt% have been studied by means of different techniques such as TPR, EPR, XANES, XRD, XRF, BET and methanol dehydrogenation reaction. The TPR patterns showed two well-defined peaks with maxima between 250–350°C and 600–650°C. The first one (peak I) corresponds to two contributions: (i) the one step reduction (Cu2+ to Cu0) of a low interacted species (S1), and (ii) the partial reduction (Cu2+ to Cu1+) of a highly dispersed and surface interacted species (S2). The second TPR peak (peak II) observed at a higher temperature corresponds to the second step reduction (Cu1+ to Cu0) of the S2 species. In addition, it has been found out that Cu0 and not Cu2+ is the active site for methanol dehydrogenation to methyl formate.",
