The initial gallium-modified catalysts prepared via ion exchange have a surface enriched in gallium as evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy of alpha particles. The combination of reductive reaction and oxidative regeneration conditions leads to gallium migration and redistribution in the zeolite crystals, as well as to chemical change in the nature of the gallium species. Maximum activity and aromatics selectivity are observed when non-framework dispersed galliumspecies have the highest concentration.

Introduction Since about 20 years, the aromatization of C3-C4 (LPG) and CS C8 (light naphtha, LN) alkanes to yield aromatics, i.e. benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX) has received increasing attention as a reforming process, because high octane BTX could be blended directly into *Corresponding author.

Abdul amid et al. /Applied Cntahsis A: General 108 (1994) 85-96 the gasoline pool. BTX also provides principal building blocks for the chemical industry in its fibre, agricultural, fine chemicals, and pharmaceutical applications. H-MFI(Si,Al) is an active catalyst for the aromatization of lower alkenes and alkanes, as illustrated by the; processes known as M-Forming [ 1 ] and M2-Forming [2], developed at Mobil Oil (M =Mobil) in the 70's and early 80's. Its activity and selectivity to aromatics, that is for the conversion of propane and/or butane, are largely improved by modification with zinc or gallium. Modifications are usually achieved by ion exchange, impregnation, isomorphous substitution of framework silicon (or aluminium) by zinc or gallium, or mechanical mixing with ZnO and Ga20,. The consequences of such modifications have been reviewed recently [ 3 ] . It is now fully established that aromatization of propane and butanes benefits greatly from the combination of zeolite Bronsted sites with dehydrogenation sites provided by the zinc or gallium component. The method of gallium or zinc introduction does not appear to affect dramatically the catalytic behaviour of a stabilised Ga/H or Zn/H-MFI(Si,Al) catalyst [4]. However, the initial aromatization activity and selectivity are strongly enhanced when catalysts modified via ion exchange or impregnation are exposed to consecutive reductive (reaction) and oxidative (regeneration) conditions [5,6]. This improvement may result from the preferential accumulation of the gallium component at the zeolite crystal surface during modification [7,8], followed by subsequent gallium migration during reaction-regeneration [5,6,9]. No direct support to or proof of these proposals were available as yet. In our investigation, several chemical, physical, and spectroscopic techniques were combined to characterise the chemical state, the location, and the migration of gallium-species in (Ga/H)-MFI(Si,Al) catalysts, as a function of increasing number of reaction (reductive)-regeneration (oxidative) operation cycles. Changes in the chemical and physical state of the gallium-component are related to catalytic behaviour. 2. Experimental 2.7. Catalyst (Ga/H)-MFI(Si,Al) catalysts with 1.6 wt.-% gallium-loading were prepared by ion exchange of two MFI(Si,Al) zeolites differing by their aluminium content (Z234: Si/ Al= 18; 2356: Si /Al= 128) with a Ga(N03) 3 solution (pH=2.0; T=373 K; t=4 h). These catalysts are coded 2234 SL2 and 2356 SL1, respectively. A catalyst was also prepared with 1.0 wt.-% Ga (Z234 SL1) and another with 3.2 wt.-% Ga (Z356 SL2) [ 10] . Following impregnation, the catalysts were washed and dried at 423 K ( 12 h). The calcination temperature was increased stepwise (1 h at 673, 723, and 773 K, respectively) up to 823 K (1 h). 2.2. Characterisation Chemical analysis was performed using X-ray fluorescence (XRF), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Chemical distributions of S.B. Abdul Hamid et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 108 (1994) 85-96 87 aluminium and gallium species were derived from the combination of solid state ''Ga, -'Al and 2\"Si magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) results with ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH,-TPD) data on samples exchanged with ammonium ions at pH about 9, in order to measure all Bronsted acid sites [ 11 ] . The morphology of the catalysts was observed by electron microscopy (SEM). Their level of structural integrity was evaluated by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and isothermal sorption of n-hexane at 363 K. The chemical modification of the gallium species was also studied further by thermal analysis (TA) and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR). The spatial distribution of the gallium species and its evolution with number of reactionregeneration cycles were studied by Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy ( RBS) of alpha particles. RBS, XPS, and EDX results were also combined for this purpose. Detailed information is available elsewhere [ 10] . 2.3. Catalvsts testing Catalytic performances were evaluated for 2234 SL2-derived materials in the temperature range of 750 to 840 IK (P= 1 bar; pure feed =C,H,,). Selected catalysts samples were analyzed as described above. Samples designated Xtr are deactivated catalysts (i.e., before regeneration) obtained after n cycles. Following each cycle, the catalysts were regenerated by first purging the reactor with nitrogen at 673 K. Calcination in air was then achieved gradually ( I h at 673, 7 23, 773 K) to a final temperature of 823 K ( 1 h), to ensure minimum deterioration, e.g. by inadvertent dealumination, of catalyst quality. Rrr designates catalysts operated for n cycles and regenerated in air. The MCR tests results are described elsewhere in detail [ 101. 3. Results and discussion 3.7. Chemical distribution ol the aluminhtm crnd gallium species The total amounts o1= aluminium atoms per unit cell, from XRF measurements, are 5.36 and 1.28 for the base materials 2234 and 2356, respectively. The total gallium atom contents per unit cell are 1.32 for 2234 SL2 and 2356 SL I , and 0.8 for 2234 SL 1. It should however be noted that, although XRF is a fast and easy-to-use method for bulk analysis of zeolites, determination of the Si/Al ratio may become rather inaccurate at low aluminium content because of the absorption of Al-emitted X-rays by the dominant silicon species. In such case, without appropriate and tedious corrections, the Si/AI ratio will be overestimated.

The non-dispersed extraframework (Ga,,t,) gallium component was calculated by difference. The chemical distributions of aluminium and gallium in the various catalysts were derived from the ''Al and 'tGa MAS NMR results and the NH,-TPD measurements (see Table 1) with the following assumptions: 1. The total number of aluminium atoms per unit cell (NA,) is 5.36 and 1.28 for the 2234 and 2356 series of catalysts, respectively. 2. The total number of gallium atoms per unit cell (Nca) is 1.32 for both the 2234 and 2356 series of catalysts. 3. The total number of potential Bronsted acid sites (PBA) is the sum of aluminium and gallium framework T-sites. It is given by PBA=AlT+Ga,. Both A'T and GaT are measured by NIAS NMR in conditions optimised for quantitative evaluation of quadrupolar nuclei [ 1 1 ] . 4. The total number of octahedrally and penta-coordinated aluminium species, Alp, , is measured by NMR. These species may ion-exchange Bronsted acid sites. They are also potential Lewis acid sites. However, they do not contribute to the desorption of ammonia from samples prepared via ammonium-exchange. The Alp,,, species are further assumed to have about a 1 + charge in accordance with recent results [ 12 ] . 5. When PBA exceeds the number of ammonia molecules desorbed per unit cell (NA), the difference is due to partial neutralisation of the Bronsted sites by the Alp+() species and ion-exchanged gallium species, Ga;,,.x. Ga;,c., species, by analogy to AI,.+,) species, are assumed to bear about a I + charge. 6.

It is further accepted that three ammonia molecules bind to Gap species [ 10,13]. These assumptions should be used as guidelines only and their limitations are obvious.

Some framework isnmorphous substitution by gallium occurs upota gallium ion exchange. The extent of this replacement is about the same in 2234 and 23556. Incorporation of gallium in the framework of the parent zeolite is mostly determined by the first acidic ion exchange, as 2234 SL I and 2234 SL2 samples have nearly identical GaT content (Fig. 1) . It is proposed that gallium-species are incorporated mainly at defect sites. In U 0 d .G d a rM C7 ro t~ m 0 a a c. P ~ a x >c r It ~' X N U) co ep c~i N tv N N ~ M N N N N N N Sample Fig. I.

Dealumination occurs for both catalysts series; it is faster for Z234SL2 which has the higher aluminium content. Framework Al-r species in 2234 SL2 and 2356 SL l are continuously transformed to non-framework species (Alp, c,, AIEV). This is believed to occur during regeneration, whereby steam produced by the oxidation of coke induces dealumination. Dealumination is more rapid, and its extent higher, in 2234 SL2 than in 2356 SL 1, as the former is richer in aluminium (dealumination is an aluminium-species \"condensation\" process). In addition, more steam should also be produced during oxidative regeneration of coked-2234 SL2 relative to regeneration of coked-2356 SL 1. Indeed, coke is formed via consecutive acid-catalysed reactions. Thus, 2234 SL2 is expected to coke more heavily at similar time-on-stream as it has 2.6 times the number of 2356 SL 1 acid sites. 3. Ga;,, is more important in 2234 SL2 than 2356 SL/, whereas the opposite .situation holds for Go,,,. Z234 has the highest ion-exchange capacity, which explains the relative values of Ga;,,. Consequently, the presence of more extraframework non-dispersed gallium (Gah in sample 2356 SLl relative to Z23 4SL2 is natural. A gallium-containing phase, most probably Ga=O, after calcination, is clearly evidenced at the surface of the 2356 SL I zeolite crystals [ 10 ] , as illustrated in Fig. 2. It appears as white flakes which become more abundant as the gallium loading increases. Two grain sizes were observed, about 0.2 mm and about 0.7 mm, scattered at the surface of the zeolite crystals (about 4 mm). The bigger Ga,,t, phase particles could be an agglomeration of several smaller ones. 4. Gal and Ga,~.~ are progressivelv converted to Ga and et entuallv Ga,,,,species, as the number o/'reaction cycles is increased. During reaction, the catalyst is exposed to reducing conditions which cause reduction of Ga;+ into more mobile Ga'+ species [5,6,9,10]. The subsequent oxidative regeneration of the coked catalyst reestablishes the oxidation state of gallium to 3 + but also produces stearn which can hydrolyse Ga;,, species to Gap entities. Ga,,,, species in 2234 SL2 and in 2356 SL I -based catalysts are continuously disappearing with increasing number of reaction regeneration cycles. Ga,, species eventually aggregate as the Gay component with increasing number of cycles (in the catalyst ageing phase). 5. Both concentrations of Ga, and Gaspecies reach a tnaxinium, for Gal otter one reaction cyele,,for Gaqier 3-8 reaction cycles. Following dealumination, some of the T-sites previously occupied by aluminium are substituted by gallium species. Sample 2234 SL2 attained a higher level of Gar than 2356 SLI and reached its maximum after one reaction-regeneration cycle. This is expected as there are more sites for gallium substitution in 2234 SL2 than in 2356 SL I . As discussed above, steam produced during oxidative regeneration may hydrolyse both Al-, and Gar out of framework positions. As a result, non-framework gallium species (Gat,, GaN continuously build up and eventually Gaspecies aggregate into Ga, entities only. Dealumination causes an overall decrease to the number of Bronsted acid sites. However, in 2234 R3, the ammonia desorption capacity increases despite the occurrence of dealumination and degalliation. This can be explained by either S.B. Abdul Hamid et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 108 (1994) 85-96 91 formation of different gallium species acting as Lewis acids or by removal of gallium species from ion-exchange positions, or by a combination of both factors. These new gallium species acre Gap (dispersed gallium) referred to above. They can have a 1 + and/or a 3 + oxidation state depending on the operating conditions. 2 ~m 1 ) Fig. 2.

Spatial distribution of the gallium species As already mentioned, unused gallium-modified catalysts are characterised by the presence of a segregated gallium-phase at the external surface of the zeolite crystals. With increasing number of reaction-regeneration cycles, gallium migration takes place, initially from the external surface of the zeolite crystals towards their intracrystalline volume. The overall dispersion and the uniformity of the gallium component distribution increase. Evidence for migration of gallium was obtained by RBS, from a detailed analysis of depth profiles for catalysts derived from zeolites 2234 SL2 (Fig. 3) and 2356 SL 1 (Fig. 4) . Changes in the spatial distribution of gallium species were also evidenced by comparing Ga/Si atomic ratios measured by techniques having different analytical probing depths, such as XPS (about 5 nm), RBS (first layer= about 70 nm), and EDX (about 200 nm) (Fig. 5) . Surface enrichment in gallium is clearly evidenced for samples 2234 SL2 and 2356 SL 1. It is always more important for catalysts derived from the parent zeolite 2356. This observation relates to the lower ion-exchange capacity and higher hydrophobicity of 2356. Quantitative analysis of the RBS profiles for gallium (Figs. 3 and 4) as well as the comparison of the Ga/Si ratios measured by XPS, RBS, and EDX (Fig. 5), which have increasing analytical probing depths, show unambiguously the redistribution of gallium species with larger number of reaction-regeneration cycles. Because of the large gallium concentration gradient in the unused 2234 SL2 and 2356 SLI samples, there is a strong driving force for gallium moving from the outside to the inside of the zeolite crystals (see for example the maximum of the Ga/Si ratio at 200 nm for 2234 R7; Fig. 3). After 9 cycles of reaction-regeneration (samples 2234 X9 and 2356 X9), gallium species are nearly homogeneously distributed.

Abdul Hamid et in. /Applied Catalysis A: General 108 (1994) 85-96 corresponds to the stabilised catalyst (optimum activity and selectivity, almost reversible deactivation-regeneration behaviour) [ 10]. As the number of cycles further increases, the catalyst enters the ageing phase. This stage is characterised by an external surface richer in gallium species which probably form aggregates of gallium(III) oxide [ 10]. This conclusion is drawn from the data presented in Fig. 1 (high level of Gar) and in Figs. 3 and 4 (surface enrichment in gallium for samples 2234 X18 and 2356 X9). Redistribution of gallium through the catalyst results from the alternation of reductive (during reaction) and oxidative (during regeneration /calcination) operating conditions, as discussed below. 3.3. Reduction and migration of gallium TPR and thermogravimetry/differential thermal analysis /differential scanning calorimetry (TG/DTA/DSC) results under hydrogen flow show that complete reduction of Ga\"' to Gal, in samples 2234 SL2 and 2356 SLI, occurs in the temperature range of 810 to 910 K [10]. TG results are summarised in Table 2. As expected, weight losses corresponding to dehydration and dehydroxylation increase with aluminium content. Weight losses in nitrogen or air are nearly similar, whereas the loss under hydrogen is considerably higher, indicating unambiguously the reduction of the gallium species. The loss of water due to reduction of Ga\"' species is almost proportional to the gallium content. To quantify further the degree of reduction of Ga\"' under hydrogen, theoretical weight losses have been estimated assuming the complete reduction of all Gal\" to Gal species. Table 3 compares experimental and theoretical values. The observed agreement confirms that gallium is reduced from the 3 + to the 1 + oxidation state. It is thus expected that gallium migration occurs as Gat species under the reducing Table 2 Summary of weight loss identifications in 2234 SLI. 7.234 SL2. 2356 SLI and 2356 SL2 Ga/H-MFI zeolitc catalysts Process of weight loss Sample 2234 SL I 2234 SL2 2356 SL I 2356 SL2 Dehydration in N, 5.11 wt.-% 5.12 wt.-'/( 2.68 wt.-c/(, 3.28 wt.-r (RT-583 K) (RT-573 K) (RT-593 K) (RT-593 K ) Dehydroxylation in N, 1.62 wt.-% 1.37 wt.-'/( 0.93 wt.-c/( 0.54 wt.-%c (583-1073 K) (573-1073 K) (593-1073 K) (593-1073 K) H,O from Ga in H, 0.26 wt.-% 0.44 wt.-r/r 0.45 wt.-'/( 0.82 wt.-'l reduction (803-9 I 3 K) (803-913 K) (783-913 K) (783-9 I 3 K ) Dehydration in air 1.28 wt.-'Y~ 1.01 wt.-%r 0.56 wt.-9r 0.42 wt.- (588-823 K) (588-823 K) (573-823 K) (628-828 K) Total weight loss.

Gallium could migrate as Ga+ ions. Solid-state ion exchange is indeed a known mechanism for ion migration [ 18]. However, thermodynamic calculations also show that Ga.'O, produced by reduction of Ga203, has an equilibrium vapour pressure of about 10-' bar at 823 K, i.e., at reduction or reaction temperature [ 19] . Thus, we believe that migration of gallium may also occur by reduction of Ga\"' oxidic species to Ga=O which is further sorbed in the intracrystalline volume of the zeolite. Gat as Ga20 can eventually be reoxidized to Ga\"' during calcination or regeneration, and isomorphous substitution of Ga;+ in the framework can then take place to some extent, as indeed proven by \"Ga MAS NMR [ 10] . Thus, it is concluded that gallium species will oscillate between the 3 + and I + oxidation states with consecutive reaction /regeneration cycles: H2(reaction) Ga2(III)03 02(regeneration) Ga2(I)O+H=O (6) Further oxidising regeneration treatments produce non-framework dispersed Gap and non-dispersed GaNp species, as discussed above. In the ageing phase, gallium as Gap and GaNp species will migrate towards the external surface with increasing number of regeneration (steaming) treatments, probably as (hydr)oxidic Ga\"' species, in a way similar to that observed for Al\"' extraframework species produced by steam-dealumination [ 20] . The catalytic activity and selectivity for aromatization of propane are stabilised and optimum, as a function of the number of reaction cycles, when the Gap phase reaches its maximum concentration in order to achieve the optimal amount of dual dehydrogenationacidic sites, as reported elsewhere [ 10,21 ] . It must also be recalled that ion-exchanged and/ or dispersed gallium-species have been demonstrated recently to be necessary for the heterolytic recombinative release of dihydrogen, i.e., to act as porthole for the desorption of molecular hydrogen [ 14,15,21,22] . 4. Conclusions The chemical state, distribution, and migration of gallium in (H,Ga)-MFI (Si,Al) catalysts have been characterised as a function of time-on-stream and number of regeneration cycles. A variety of aluminium and gallium species have been identified and quantified. 96 S.B. Abdul Hamid et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 108 (1994) 85-96 Surface enrichment in gallium has been demonstrated for the unused catalysts. It is more important for zeolites which possess less ion-exchange sites and are more hydrophobic. Some gallium is also substituted isomorphously in framework T-sites, as a result of the ionexchange/impregnation treatment at low pH and high temperature. Gallium migration and redistribution through the zeolite crystals is initially favoured under reductive reaction conditions. Reduction of gallium from the 3 + to the 1 + oxidation has been demonstrated to occur in reductive atmosphere, such as present during reaction. Gallium migration thus occurs as Ga' species, probably as Ga~O via the vapour phase. However, solid state ion exchange is not ruled out. Ga'+ is reoxidised to Ga'+ during regeneration. Some of the Ga3+ species can substitute isomorphously framework T-sites. Eventually, the external surface of the zeolite crystals becomes richer in Ga\"' species. Catalyst activity and selectivity are stabilised, following an activation period and/or before the catalyst deactivates, when a non-framework dispersed gallium phase is present in the highest amount.
