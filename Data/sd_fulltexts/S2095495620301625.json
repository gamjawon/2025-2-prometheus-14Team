College of Materials Science and Engineering Shenzhen University Shenzhen Guangdong 518060 China γ-MnO2 nanorod-assembled hierarchical micro-spheres with abundant oxygen defects are synthesized by a simple thermal treatment approach as oxygen reduction electrocatalysts for Al (aluminum) - air batteries. The rich oxygen vacancies on the surface of γ-MnO2 are verified by morphology, structure, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalytic activity of γ-MnO2 is significantly improved by the incoming oxygen vacancies. The γ-MnO2 nanorod-assembled hierarchical micro-spheres calcined under 300 °C in Ar atmosphere show the best ORR performance. The primary Al-air batteries using γ-MnO2 catalysts as the cathode, which demonstrates excellent peal power density of 318 mW cm−2 when applying the γ-MnO2 catalysts with optimal amount of oxygen vacancies. γ-MnO2 nanorod-assembled micro-spheres with oxygen vacancies demonstrate efficient oxygen reduction electrocatalytic performance for Al-air batteries. Image, graphical abstract Keywords γ-MnO2 Oxygen vacancy ORR electrocatalysts Al-air battery 1 Introduction With the growing global energy crisis and severe environmental pollution, metal air batteries have attracted much attention and become one of the most promising clean energy storage devices [1]. Aluminum is a promising anode material for metal air batteries due to the advantages of low cost, abundant resource, and high energy capacity (2.98 Ah g−1). Different from the lithium-ion batteries, Al-air battery generates electric power through an oxidation–reduction reaction between Al and O2 (oxygen) [2]. The electrochemical ORR process happened with sluggish kinetic due to the difficulty in splitting the strong oxygen–oxygen double bond (498 kJ mol−1) [3–5], therefore the practical Al-air battery specific capacity is usually lower than their theoretical capacity because of the insufficient cathode performance [6]. The cathode electrocatalytic activity depends on the ORR electrocatalyst which is an important researching issue in the field of Al-air battery. The best ORR electrocatalysts are Pt-based materials in both alkaline and acidic solutions. However, the scarcity and high price of platinum require exploring the approach to enhance the noble metal catalyst utilization or developing the low-cost non-precious electrocatalysts. As an alternative non-noble metal catalyst for ORR, manganese oxides such as MnO2 have received intensive attention for applications in electrochemical energy storage and catalysis [7–21]. A variety of strategies have been developed to enhance the electrocatalytic performance of MnO2 including coating with metals, doping with cations, and integrating conductive nanostructures, etc. [22–27]. Among them, introducing oxygen defects is considered as a simple process to boost the inherent activity of MnO2. For example, β-MnO2 with more oxygen vacancies formed by thermal treatment exhibits higher ORR activity than that of pristine β-MnO2 [28]. On the other hand, the technique of Ar plasma treatment could create more oxygen defects within the type of α-MnO2 and result the α-MnO2 exhibits much enhanced catalytic activity [29]. However, the effect of the relative content of oxygen vacancies in MnO2 on the ORR performance has still not been discussed. γ-MnO2 has been investigated in the catalytic oxygen reduction reactions due to its excellent performance, low-cost raw material, and low toxicity [30]. Herein, a simple strategy is presented to develop oxygen vacancies in the γ-MnO2 nanorod-assembled hierarchical micro-spheres (γ-MnO2−MS), which is used as the cathode catalyst in boosting the ORR for the practical Al-air battery. It was found that by heat treatment of the γ-MnO2−MS under the different temperature, the as-obtained γ-MnO2−MS with various content of oxygen vacancies can be fabricated, which show quite difference in electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction. The optimized amount of oxygen vacancies in γ-MnO2−MS by heat treatment is formed at 300 °C, which shows the significantly enhanced electrocatalytic activity for ORR. The primary Al-air battery with γ-MnO2 cathode under 300 °C exhibits superior output power density of 318 mW cm−2 (at a discharge current density of 418 mA cm−2) compared with that pristine γ-MnO2 cathode (176 mW cm−2). 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The γ-MnO2 nanoparticles were obtained by a hydrothermal method according to the previous report [30]. In the procedure, 3.375 g MnSO4•H2O and 4.575 g (NH4)2S2O8 were dissolved in 40 mL deionized water respectively. Then pre-prepared MnSO4•H2O and (NH4)2S2O8 were mixed together. Stirring magnetically for about 20 min, the mixed solutions moved into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, sealed and heated at 90 °C for 24 h in an oven. Then the solutions were allowed to cool naturally to room temperature. The resulting solid products were centrifuged, washed with distilled water and absolute ethanol for five times and finally dried in air at 50 °C for 5 h. To obtain different oxygen-vacant MnO2 samples, the resulting microspheres were calcined in Ar (argon) at the following temperature for 2 h: 250 °C, 300 °C and 350 °C. The three specimens are denoted as 250 °C-Ar, 300 °C-Ar, 350 °C-Ar, respectively. 250 °C-Ar specimen denotes a specimen synthesized by heating pristine nanorods under 250 °C for 2 h in Ar. 2.2 Catalysts characterization The phase structures of the resulting products were examined by XRD analysis using filtered Cu-Kα radiation. The morphologies characteristics of the products were studied by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JAMP-9500F) and high-resolution transmission electronic microscopy (TEM, FEIG2 spirit). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ES-CALAB 250Xi, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for compositional analysis. The surface area measurements were made by N2 adsorption/desorption using a micromeritics ASAP 2020. The thermal stability of the pristine MnO2 was realized on a TGA instrument (model: Q50) under a dynamic Ar from ambient temperature to 800 °C at 5 °C min−1. The EPR measurements were performed on an EMX EPR spectrometer (Bruker, Karlsruhe). 2.3 Electrochemical activity testing The electrochemical tests were gauged with cyclic voltammetry experiments using a CHI660C electrochemical test system (Chen-Hua, Shanghai, China). The electrolyte used in this study was 0.1 mol L−1 KOH aqueous medium saturated with oxygen unless otherwise stated. The reference electrode was an Ag/AgCl electrode and the counter electrode was a graphite rod. The working electrode was a thin-film layer of MnO2 catalyst on a previously polished and cleaned glassy carbon disk surface. In order to ensure electronic conductivity, the as-prepared MnO2 catalyst was mixed with acetylene black (weight ratio of 3:7). This mixture was put into a suitable 10 mL tube containing neutralized Nafion (Sigma-Aldrich) and alcohol. And this suspension was sonicated for at least 40 min. Then 10 uL of the catalyst ink were transferred to the glassy carbon disk surface and then dried in the air to form a thin film electrode. The scan rate of the RDE and RRDE (rotating disk electrode and rotating ring-disk electrode) was 5 mV s−1 for all electrocatalytic measurements. During RRDE testing process, the potential versus Ag/AgCl on the Pt ring was 0.53 V in order to assess the formation amount of peroxide. Catalyst loading (MnO2 or Pt/C (20% Pt supported on Vulcan XC-72 carbon) and acetylene black with the weight ratio of 3:7) is approximately 0.2 mg cm−2 for RDE and RRDE, respectively. 2.4 Al-air battery test The homemade test-cell with air cathode loaded by the MnO2 catalyst was investigated. Battery polarization and stability measurements were studied by using a multichannel battery testing system (BTS, Neware technology limited Corp.) at ambient temperature. The cathode electrode consists of active layer, Ni-foam conducting layer and gas diffusion layer composed of carbon material and polytetrauoro-ethylene (PTFE). The catalytic layer of cathode electrode contains acetylene black, 5 wt% PTFE emulsion, MnO2 catalysts. Firstly, the MnO2 catalysts, PTFE and acetylene black were mixed according to the weight ratio of 3:4:7 and grinded for 20 min. Then this mixture adds appropriate alcohol to form a slurry and this slurry was agitated at 80 °C with a magnetic stirrer for 40 min. The resulting products were rolled and cold pressed into a piece of Ni-foam under a pressure of 5 MPa to prepare the conducting layer and the catalyst layer. The alkaline solution was 4 M KOH and the electrocatalytic area of the cathode electrode was 0.4 cm2. Catalyst loading is approximately 2 mg cm−2 on the air electode in Al-air battery. 3 Results and discussion The crystal phases of the as-prepared powders are determined by using XRD technique. Fig. 1 (a) shows the XRD pattern of four kinds of particles. The diffraction peaks of pristine MnO2 can be unambiguously indexed to the pure orthorhombic phase of γ-MnO2 (JCPDS, file no. 14–0644). The sharp and narrow peaks suggest that the pristine products are highly crystalline. The phase of MnO2 is maintained below 300 °C in Ar (Fig. 1a and Fig. S1). No characteristic peaks of other phases, such as Mn2O3, Mn3O4, are observed. The diffraction peaks of Mn3O4 (JCPDS, file no. 24–0734)is detected in 350 °C. EPR and XPS measurements are carried out to investigated the influence of the heat treatment process on the MnO2 surface electronic states. Fig. 1(b) shows the EPR spectra of four MnO2 products at 77 K. A strong broad electron resonance about 3185 G is detected for the heat-treated MnO2, which corresponds to the effective gyromagnetic ratio at g = 2.00. It can be due to the trapped electrons from oxygen vacancies [31]. However, no obvious peak is detected for the pristine MnO2 by electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer. The similar profiles of the peak for three calcined samples represent the signal of oxygen vacancy from Fig. 1(b), while the peak strength is positively correlated with the content of oxygen vacancies. By comparing the peak strength of four samples in Fig. 1(b), it can be seen that the content of oxygen vacancies of 300 °C-Ar MnO2 is higher than that of 250 °C-Ar MnO2 and there are almost no oxygen vacancies on the surface of pristine MnO2. Meanwhile, the content of oxygen vacancies of 350 °C-Ar MnO2 is almost as same as that of 300 °C-Ar MnO2. Fig. 1(c) shows the O 1s core level XPS spectra of the pristine MnO2, 250 °C-Ar MnO2, 300 °C-Ar MnO2 and 350 °C-Ar MnO2. The peak at the binding energy of 531.1 eV corresponds to the oxygen species adsorbed on surface (Oads), such as O2 2− or O− in forms of carbonate CO3 2− and hydroxyl OH− species [32]. Meanwhile, the peak at the binding energy 529.6 eV is related to the lattice oxygen (Olatt) [33]. The weakest peak at the binding energy of 532.7 eV corresponds to absorbed molecular H2O and CO anchored on the carbon surface (Osurf). Fig. 1(d) shows the Mn 2p X-ray photoelectron spectra of various MnO X . Four kinds of γ-MnO2 present two peaks at 641.3 eV and 642.5 eV which are attributed to the surface Mn3+, Mn4+ [34], and the Mn 2p 1/2 peaks corresponding to Mn 2p 3/2 peaks are also detected. Meanwhile, the 250 °C-Ar MnO2, 300 °C-Ar MnO2, 350 °C-Ar MnO2 surface give a Mn3+/Mn4+ atomic ratio of 0.43/1, 0.46/1, 0.47/1, respectively. In comparison with the above atomic ratio, pristine MnO2 surface gives a lowest value of 0.40:1. Based on the electric neutrality principle, it is seen that oxygen vacancies lead to the rise of Mn3+ and reduction of Mn4+ On the surface of γ-MnO2 [26]. According to the experimental results, a small quantity of another phase for the samples at 350 °C may be attributed to high concentration of oxygen deficiency. The content of oxygen vacancies in γ-MnO2 increases with the synthesis temperature. While the ratio between Mn and O is out of balance, the amount of Mn-O bonding is not enough to maintain the crystal structure of γ-MnO2. Thus, the positions of Mn and O atoms will be changed to achieved a stable structure, which produces a new phase (i.e., Mn3O4). Fig. 2 (a) shows the SEM images of the nano-rods assembled hierarchical micro-sphere prepared from the hydrothermal solution. From Fig. 2(a and b), it is seen that the sphere-like hierarchical structure has the diameter of 6–10 μm on a large scale and the diameter of nano-rods is about 75 nm on average. Fig. 2(c, e, g) shows the SEM images of hierarchical microspheres after heated treatment of the pristine MnO2 at 250 °C, 300 °C and 350 °C with argon as blanket gas. As can be seen from Fig. 2(c, e, g), the sphere-like products are much fluffier than the pristine MnO2. And the size of nano-rod particles is basically the same as that of the pristine MnO2 (see Fig. 2d, 2f, 2h). Meanwhile, the four samples demonstrate similar high BET specific surface areas (Fig. S2) due to the architecture of nanorod-assembled hierarchical micro-spheres. To further investigate the defect characteristic details of γ-MnO2, TEM and HRTEM measurements have been carried out and the images of the γ-MnO2 (pristine, 250 °C-Ar, 300 °C-Ar, 350 °C-Ar) are shown in Fig. 3 , respectively. Compared to the pristine product, the other annealed samples possess some defects on their surface attributed to the lack of oxygen during heat treatment process. Meanwhile, Fig. 3(b and d) shows HRTEM images of pristine γ-MnO2 and 250 °C-Ar MnO2. From Fig. 3(b), the domain is indicative of a special orthorhombic phase. The measured lattice fringe value of the pristine γ-MnO2 is about 0.396 nm, matching the d values of (120) plane of γ-MnO2. In Fig. 3(d), The measured lattice fringe value of the pristine γ-MnO2 is about 0.261 nm, matching the d values of (031) plane of γ-MnO2. Fig. 3(f and h) shows HRTEM images of 300 °C-Ar MnO2 and 350 °C-Ar MnO2. From Fig. 3(f and h), it is seen that there are two different domains, which indicates a special orthorhombic phase and a new phase. The measured lattice fringe value of 300 °C-Ar γ-MnO2 is about 0.26 nm and 0.277 nm, matching the (031) lattice spacing of γ-MnO2 and the (103) lattice spacing of Mn3O4, respectively. The measured lattice fringe value of 350 °C-Ar γ-MnO2 is about 0.396 nm and 0.313 nm, matching the (120) lattice spacing of γ-MnO2 and the (112) lattice spacing of Mn3O4, respectively. The new lattice fringe should be attributed to phase transformation or reconstruction. The electrochemical performance of as-prepared MnO2 samples is studied by RDE and RRDE in 0.1 mol L−1 KOH aqueous medium to evaluate the effect of the oxygen defect on ORR activity of γ-MnO2. Fig. 4 shows linear sweeping voltammograms of the ORR on four different kinds of electrocatalysts ((a) pristine MnO2; (b) 250 °C-Ar MnO2; (c) 300 °C-Ar MnO2; (d) 350 °C-Ar MnO2)). For four kinds of different electrocatalysts, the voltammetric profiles in 0.1 M KOH solution saturated with O2 show the current density is enhanced with the increase of the rotation rate from 300 to 1800 rpm. From Fig. 4, it is seen that the cathodic currents in Ar-saturated solution are negligible compared with the cathodic currents in O2-saturated solution. Therefore, the disk currents in O2-saturated solution can represent the ORR activity of MnO2 samples. Fig. 5 (a) shows the corresponding Koutecky-Levich (K-L) plots and fitting lines of the samples obtained from rotation-speed-dependent current. Based on the slopes of K-L curves, the electron transfer number (n) of carbon black, the pristine, 250 °C-Ar sample, 300 °C-Ar sample and 350 °C-Ar sample are evaluated to be 1.85, 3.39, 3,71, 3.85, 3.60 at 0.45 V, respectively. It indicates that the carbon black is a dominating two-electron ORR pathway and γ-MnO2 is a quasi-four-electron reduction process and electron transfer number of 300 °C-Ar sample is the highest value among four MnO2 samples. In Fig. 5(b), half-wave potential of the 300 °C-Ar sample is 56 mV more than that of 250 °C-Ar sample and is 111 mV more than that of pristine sample. The half-wave potential of the 300 °C-Ar sample is 100 mV lower than that of a commercial Pt/C catalyst (Pt/C and acetylene black with the weight ratio of 3:7). With the increase of the number of oxygen-vacancies, It is found that ORR performance of MnO2 in terms of half-wave potential can be promoted. However, the 350 °C-Ar sample is less positive half-wave potential than 300 °C-Ar sample. The results suggest that a new phase can weaken the electrocatalytic enhancement. Fig. 5(c) shows typical voltammograms of the ORR for five kinds of different catalysts at 5 mV s−1. As can be seen from Fig. 5(c), disk currents at the catalyst layer formed from MnO2 are larger than at the carbon black layer and MnO2 catalysts show lower overpotentials compared to carbon black. To further assess the ORR catalytic activity for MnO2, the ring currents (I R) and disk currents (I D) were detected to calculate the n and percent of peroxide (y) through the equations: (1) n = 4 N I D / ( N I D + I R ) (2) y = 200 I R / ( N I D + I R ) where N (0.37) is the current collection efficiency of RRDE [35, 36]. Fig. 5(d) shows the electron transfer number and percentage of peroxide for γ-MnO2 and Pt/C at varying potentials. The n on γ-MnO2 is above 3.4 from 0.40 V to 0.60 V. This suggests a four electron reduction process, which is consistent with the results from the K-L curves. Compared with the n and y on pristine MnO2, the higher n and lower y on oxygen-vacant γ-MnO2 indicate oxygen vacancy can enhance ORR catalytic activity. Interestingly, in terms of the n and y of three different kinds of oxygen-vacant MnO2, the ORR performance of the 300 °C-Ar MnO2 outperform that of the 250 °C-Ar MnO2 and 350 °C-Ar MnO2 in a certain voltage range. Meanwhile, the n of the 300 °C-Ar MnO2 is about 0.12 lower than that of Pt/C and the y of the 300 °C-Ar MnO2 is about 9% higher than that of Pt/C from 0.64 V to 0.8 V. The annealing temperatures affect the ORR performance and the optimized thermal treatment temperature is 300 °C (Fig. S3). Hence, an appropriate concentration of oxygen vacancies for MnO2 can maximize its enhancement effect in ORR activity. It may be attributed to the following factors. Surface structures and the amount of oxygen-vacancies that affect ORR performance changes during the annealing process. As the temperature increases, the amount of oxygen-vacancies raises and the position of Mn on the surface of MnO2 crystal basically remains constant. In this case, the ORR performance improves with the increase in the amount of oxygen-vacancies. However, when the annealing temperature rises to 350 °C, the samples rarely exist the second phase (see Fig. 1a). That is to say, the positions of Mn in the surface of MnO2 change when the amount of oxygen-vacancies increases to a certain extent as to destroy the original balance of the surface structure. Compare 300 °C-Ar MnO2 to 350 °C-Ar MnO2, The amount of oxygen-vacancies for 350 °C-Ar MnO2 is almost as same as that of 300 °C-Ar MnO2. However, the ORR performance of 350 °C-Ar MnO2 is lower than that of 300 °C-Ar MnO2. It should be due to a new phase in the 350 °C-Ar MnO2. The new phase is tetragonal Mn3O4 in the 350 °C-Ar-MnO2 from Fig. 1. As is well known, Mn3O4 is constituted by Mn2+ species at the A sites ( M n A 2 + ) and Mn3+ species at the B sites ( M n B 3 + ). It does not contain Mn4+ species and γ-MnO2 contains Mn4+ species. During oxygen reduction of Mn4+ oxides, there is a mediation process that Mn(Ⅳ) get the electron into Mn(Ⅲ), followed by the electron transfer Mn(Ⅲ) to oxygen. The occurrence of this mediation process is the reason that the ORR activities of 300 °C-Ar-MnO2 with larger MnO2 content are higher than that of 350 °C-Ar-MnO2 [37, 38]. The performance of the primary Al-air battery with γ-MnO2 is investigated by measuring polarization and discharging stability. Fig. 6 (a) shows reaction mechanism of the primary Al-air battery. Based on the best ORR performance of 300 °C-Ar MnO2 among the different heating treated MnO2, we investigate the performance of the primary batteries employing pristine γ-MnO2 and 300 °C-Ar γ-MnO2 as cathode catalysts. The 300 °C-Ar γ-MnO2 based Al-air battery exhibits an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.85 V, which is higher than 1.64 V for the pristine γ-MnO2 (Fig. S4). Fig. 6(b) shows I-V plots of the primary Al-air batteries with pristine MnO2 catalyst and 300 °C-Ar MnO2 catalyst in 4 mol L−1 KOH aqueous medium. The open circuit voltages of pristine and 300 °C-Ar MnO2 are very close to one another in Fig. 6(b). From 0 to 100 mA cm−2, the batteries with pristine and 300 °C-Ar MnO2 have the similar power density. However, from 100 to 420 mA cm−2, the discharge power density of the battery with 300 °C-Ar MnO2 is higher than that with pristine. Meanwhile, 300 °C-Ar MnO2 gives a peak power density of 318 mW cm−2 corresponding to 440 mA cm−2 and the peak power density of pristine only is 176 mW cm−2 corresponding to 280 mA cm−2. It is due to the high electrocatalytic oxygen reduction activity of oxygen-vacant γ-MnO2. Fig. 6(c) shows the durability of Al-air battery under 100 mA cm−2 for about 12 h at ambient temperature. Through the voltages corresponding to onset current during the whole operational period, the performance decay rates of the primary battery were calculated. Through the calculated values, the degradation rates of the battery based on 300 °C-Ar MnO2 and pristine MnO2 as cathode catalyst are merely 2% after 40,000 s, indicating that the MnO2 with oxygen-vacant has almost no enhancement effect on degradation. Meanwhile, it can also be deduced that the γ-MnO2 as cathode catalyst possesses superior stabilities and can be applied to long-time discharging. Additionally, it can also be seen that it exists the only one discharge plateaus for Al-air battery from Fig. 6(c). Based on the different selectivity of 4e- reactions and 2e- reactions of oxygen reduction process at certain voltage for the MnO2 catalysts from Fig. 5(d), the only one plateau can be attributed to 4e- reactions and 2e- reactions during the continuous discharge process. In all, Al-air battery based on 300 °C-Ar γ-MnO2 shows higher output performance than the battery with pristine catalyst in alkaline solution. Fig. 6(d) shows two Al-air batteries in series are assembled to light up LEDs with “Al-air” shape. This implies that the potential of 300 °C-Ar γ-MnO2 electrode is suitable for the 4 Conclusions γ-MnO2 nanorod-assembled hierarchical micro-spheres with different content of oxygen defects are synthesized by a simple thermal treatment approach as Al-air batteries’ ORR electrocatalysts. The oxygen defects of MnO2 can enhance the ORR electrocatalytic performance reflecting as the positive half-wave potential, high electron transfer number and low peroxide yield. Meanwhile, an appropriate concentration of oxygen vacancies in γ-MnO2 can optimize the ORR activity and 300 °C-Ar γ-MnO2 shows the best ORR performance. The primary Al-air battery based on 300 °C-Ar γ-MnO2 demonstrates higher performance (318 mW cm−2) than the battery with pristine γ-MnO2 catalyst (176 mW cm−2).

The rich oxygen vacancies on the surface of γ-MnO2 are verified by morphology, structure, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalytic activity of γ-MnO2 is significantly improved by the incoming oxygen vacancies. The γ-MnO2 nanorod-assembled hierarchical micro-spheres calcined under 300 °C in Ar atmosphere show the best ORR performance. The primary Al-air batteries using γ-MnO2 catalysts as the cathode, which demonstrates excellent peal power density of 318 mW cm−2 when applying the γ-MnO2 catalysts with optimal amount of oxygen vacancies.",
