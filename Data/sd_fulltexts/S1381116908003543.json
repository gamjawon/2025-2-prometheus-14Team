Keywords Amines Dimethyl carbonate Methoxycarbonylation Methyl phenyl carbamate Mesoporous AlSBA-15 1 Introduction There has been significant interest in the manufacture of carbamates (isocyanate precursors) due to their commercial value as intermediates [1] for the synthesis of pesticides, fungicides, herbicides [2,3], medical drugs [4,5], polyurethane foams. In organic synthesis, carbamates are often used as protecting groups for amine functionality [6]. The important and extensive application of carbamates has made them compounds of great interest. Moreover they can be transformed into isocyanates by thermal cracking as shown below. Isocyantes are used as precursors to polyurethane elastomers, agrochemicals, adhesives and reaction injection mouldings [7,8]. Originally carbamates were almost exclusively synthesized by the reaction of amines with phosgene or its derivatives [9]. This procedure had several drawbacks, among which the extreme toxicity of phosgene and generation of byproduct HCl is the main. So, several efforts have been made for the preparation of the carbamate compounds using non-toxic reagents and for the development of novel environmentally friendly methodologies. Carbamate synthesis has been accomplished by oxidative carbonylation of aromatic amines [10–13], reductive carbonylation of aromatic nitro derivatives [14–16], and methoxycarbonylation of amines [17–22] and substituted urea [23,24]. Compared to different methods, methoxycarbonylation of amines has been less studied because DMC has long been synthesized from methanol and phosgene. DMC is now industrially produced on large scale by oxidative carbonylation of methanol with CO2 [25] which have lowered its cost of production. Thus, the use of alkyl carbonates is becoming an attractive route for the synthesis of carbamates. Various homogeneous catalysts are reported for synthesis of MPC from aniline and DMC. Most of the catalysts used are zinc [26–30] and lead [18,31] compounds. Zinc acetate was found to be the most active for MPC synthesis. Gurgilio [27] prepared MPC over zinc acetate and achieved 99.8% selectivity. Baba et al. [32] used zinc acetate as catalyst in synthesis of mono and dicarbamate while Xue et al. [29] used the same catalyst for synthesizing toluene-2,4 dicarbamate. Among the lead compounds Fu et al. [17] used Pb(OAc)2.Pb(OH)2 as catalyst and achieved 95% carbamate selectivity. Toshihide et al. [18] used Pb(NO3)2 for methoxycarbonylation of aliphatic amines. Though zinc and lead compounds exhibit high conversion and selectivity, they possess certain drawbacks. It was found that zinc acetate easily lost its activity because its change to ZnO after being used once only. Lead compounds in spite of their excellent catalytic activity could not be used due to their toxicity and environmental non-friendliness. Besides this, product separation and recovery of homogeneous catalysts are also difficult. To overcome the aforementioned shortcomings, synthesis of MPC was studied using solid acid catalysts. Li et al. [33] used In2O3/SiO2 but the catalytic activity was low and MPC yield was only 59.4%. But Li et al. [34] used ZrO2/SiO2 and at a temperature of 443K for 7h, the conversion of aniline was 98% with 79.8% MPC selectivity. However, these claims have not been proved to be successful in large scale MPC production. Aluminium containing mesoporous silica was expected to show high catalytic performance for the reaction of relatively large molecules since the isomorphous substitution of aluminium into mesoporous framework of MCM-41 and SBA-15 induces the Brönsted and Lewis acidity [35]. However, only a few applications of mesoporous aluminosilicate to acid catalyzed reaction have been realized. Katada et al. [36] have studied the use of AlMCM-41 for the synthesis of carbamates but unfortunately activity of the material was found to be less and low yield of carbamate was obtained. Due to lower hydrothermal stability of AlMCM-41 and low yield of carbamate we tried to explore this reaction with AlSBA-15 having larger pore diameter, thicker pore walls, and higher hydrothermal stability. In the present paper, we have demonstrated the effective use of AlSBA-15 for the synthesis of methyl phenyl carbamate from dimethyl carbonate and aniline. Our results presented in this manuscript demonstrate a non-phosgene route for the synthesis of MPC via methoxycarbonylation of aniline with DMC using an ordered heterogeneous AlSBA-15 catalyst under liquid phase reaction conditions. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Aniline was purchased from Merck India Ltd., dimethyl carbonate was purchased from Spectrochem India Ltd. aluminium chloride, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (average molecular weight, 5800) were procured from Aldrich, USA. All the chemicals were of research grade and were used after drying following standard procedures. 2.2 Catalyst preparation Synthesis of AlSBA-15: The synthesis of mesoporous silica SBA-15 was first reported by Stucky and co-workers [37]. In a typical synthesis, 4g of amphiphilic triblock copolymer, poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (average molecular weight, 5800) was dispersed in 30ml of water, and 120g of 2M HCl solution was added while stirring. 8g of TEOS was then added to the homogeneous solution with stirring. This gel mixture was continuously stirred at 40°C for 24h and finally crystallized in a Teflon-lined autoclave at 100°C for 2 days. After crystallization, the solid product was filtered, washed with distilled water, and dried in air at room temperature. The material was calcined in static air at 550°C for 24h to decompose the triblock copolymer and obtained a white powder SBA-15. SBA-15 was used as the parent material to synthesize AlSBA-15 via a post-synthesis route similar to that reported elsewhere [38]. Series of AlSBA-15 catalysts (with Si/Al ratio ranging 10–40 taken in stoichiometric compositions during synthesis) were prepared using SBA-15. In a sample preparation, SBA-15 (1g) was combined with 25ml of dry ethanol containing different amounts of AlCl3 with magnetic stirring at 80°C for 10h. The solid material was then filtered, washed vigorously with dry ethanol, and dried at room temperature in air to give AlSBA-15. It was then calcined in static air at 550°C for 5h. 2.3 Characterization Low-angle X-ray diffraction patterns of mesoporous samples were collected on a Philips X’ Pert Pro 3040/60 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (l =1.5418Å), a nickel filter, and an X’celerator as a detector, using the real time multiple strip (RTMS) detection technique. XRD patterns were collected in the range of 2θ =0.5–5. The specific surface area of the catalysts was measured by N2 physisorption at liquid nitrogen temperature with an Omnisorb 100 CX (Coulter). Samples were dried at 300°C in a dynamic vacuum for 2h before the N2 physisorption measurements. The specific surface area was determined using the standard BET method on the basis of adsorption data. The pore size distributions were calculated from both adsorption and desorption branches of the isotherms using the BJH method and the corrected Kelvin equation. Pore volume values were determined using the t-plot method of De Boer. Acidity of the sample was measured by TPD of adsorbed NH3 (Micromeritics, Autochem 2910). The standard procedure for TPD measurements involved the activation of the sample in flowing helium at 500°C (3h), cooling to 25°C adsorbing NH3 from a stream of He-NH3 (10% NH3 in He), removing the physically adsorbed NH3 by desorbing at 100°C for 1h in He and finally carrying out the TPD experiment by raising the temperature of the catalyst at 10°C/min. 2.4 Catalytic activity measurements Experiments were carried out in a Parr autoclave with a capacity of 50cm3. In a typical reaction, aniline (1.5g), dimethyl carbonate (14.5g) and catalyst (0.8g, activated at 500°C prior to use) were placed in the vessel. Samples were withdrawn at regular intervals of time and analyzed by gas chromatography (Shimadzu 14B) equipped with a cross-linked 5% diphenyl–95% dimethylpolysiloxane capillary column (30m) and a flame ionization detector. The identities of products were confirmed by GCMS (Shimadzu GCMS QP 5000) equipped with an identical column and a mass selective detector. Conversions were calculated with respect to weight percentage of aniline since DMC was used in excess. 3 Results and discussion Methoxycarbonylation of aniline by DMC to give methyl phenyl carbamate (Scheme 1 ) was chosen as a model reaction to test the performance of AlSBA-15 catalyst and comparing its activity with reported catalyst system, i.e. AlMCM-41. In this reaction MPC was formed in a major amount under the reaction conditions studied, whereas N-methyl aniline (NMA) and N,N-dimethyl aniline (DMA) were the minor products (Scheme 2 ). 3.1 Characterization of the catalysts XRD patterns of SBA-15 and calcined AlSBA-15 catalysts with different Si/Al ratios shown in Fig. 1 ((a)–(e)) consist of three well-resolved peaks in the 2θ range of 0.8–1.8 correspond to the (100), (110), (200) reflections, which are associated with p6mm hexagonal symmetry in the materials. Isomorphous substitution of Al into the framework of siliceous SBA-15 by the post-synthesis method did not show any changes in the XRD pattern implying that the hexagonal mesoporous structure is retained after modification. Textural properties such as specific surface area, specific pore volume, and mesopore size distribution are shown in Table 1 . AlSBA-15 showed a narrow pore size distribution with average mesopore size of 77Å and high surface are of 685m2/g. The overall N2 adsorption amounts decreased depending on the aluminum loading though no particular trend was observed. Alumination of SBA-15 did not affect the original pore structure of the parent SBA-15 while the surface areas slightly decreased with increase in aluminium loading (Table 1). Our earlier studies confirmed the successful synthesis of AlSBA-15 with retention of its periodicity and hexagonal arrangement of mesopores [39]. The acidities of the AlSBA-15 (different Si/Al ratios) and SBA-15 samples were measured by NH3-TPD method and results are shown in Table 1. Total acidity increased with decrease in Si/Al ratio. This is due to the increase in number of acid sites on AlSBA-15 with a decrease in Si/Al ratio. It is to be noted that pure mesoporous silica is acidic in nature (total acidity of 0.08mmol/g of NH3) though the acidity is low compared to AlSBA-15. These experiments clearly showed that acid sites were formed after alumination on the surface of the solid. 3.2 Catalytic study MPC synthesis from DMC and aniline has been carried out using AlSBA-15 (with different Si/Al ratio). The results are compared with AlMCM-41 as reported by Katada et al. [36]. The characteristic data and catalytic activities of these catalysts are depicted in Table 1 along with the reaction conditions. AlSBA-15 (Si/Al=10) gave the highest activity with 86% aniline conversion with 67% selectivity to MPC and the others followed as AlSBA-15 (20) (49%,), AlSBA-15 (30) (27%) and AlSBA-15 (40) (12%). The results indicate that the conversion increases with decrease in Si/Al ratios, i.e. increase in acidity. The yield for MPC using AlSBA-15 (10) was 58% whereas the yield for MPC was only 10% with AlMCM-41. It was found that AlMCM-41 in spite of its high surface area and acidity resulted in poor catalytic activity. This is due to its small pore size (24.6Å) as compared to AlSBA-15 (10) (76.7Å) which hinders the accessibility to the acidic sites. Researchers have demonstrated that SBA-15 has thicker pore walls, higher hydrothermal stability than MCM-41. Additionally the pore diameter of SBA-15 can be tuned without disrupturing its hexagonal channels, whereas enlarging the pore diameter of MCM-41 leads to diminished mesoscopic ordering [40]. These findings show the superiority of SBA-15 to MCM-41. Hence the difference in catalytic activity can be attributed to the difference in textural properties of SBA-15 and MCM-41. The acid sites inside the mesoporous cavities of AlSBA-15 are more accessible than AlMCM-41 due to a larger pore size leading to a high conversion of substrate and Lewis acidity of aluminium leads to the formation of MPC. MPC synthesis from aniline and DMC was studied by varying the temperatures (90–120°C), keeping constant catalyst 0.16g (1% of the total reactant weight) and aniline to DMC mole ratio as 1:10. The results are shown in Fig. 2 . The results show that the activity (conversion of aniline) of the catalyst increases substantially with increasing reaction temperature. At 90°C, the conversion was only 36%, which increased to 70% at 120°C in 2h of reaction. However, the distribution of the products show that selectivity of MPC increases with temperature up to 100°C and the decreases apparently. At higher temperature (>100°C), the side reactions are accelerated (Scheme 2) and N-methylation is more favorable than carbamate formation. The reaction was also carried out with aniline to DMC molar ratios ranging from 1:5 to 1:20 keeping catalyst weight (0.16g) and temperature (100°C) constant and the results are shown in Fig. 3 . The results show that the conversion of aniline increased from 12 to 67% on varying the molar ratio from 5 to 20 over a period of 2h. This is because excess of DMC ensures complete conversion of aniline and is favorable to the reaction (Scheme 1) shifting towards the right side. However, the selectivity of MPC increased up to aniline to DMC mole ratio 1:10, and then decreased slightly. Thus the optimal aniline to DMC mole ratio is 1:10. The effect of catalyst concentration on aniline conversion was studied at 100°C with aniline to DMC mole ratio 1:10 for a period of 2h (Fig. 4 ) by varying its concentration from 1 to 7wt%. It shows that as the catalyst concentration increases, the conversion of aniline increases for more active sites provided by the catalyst. When the catalyst weight is 5% of the total reaction mixture weight, aniline converts almost completely and MPC selectivity reaches the maximal value (65%). With further increase in catalyst weight MPC selectivity decreases. The effect of reaction time on the activity of the catalyst was studied at 100°C with aniline to DMC mole ratio 1:10, catalyst weight 5%. The results are shown in (Fig. 5 ). The conversion of aniline increases with time and aniline converts completely in 3h. MPC selectivity increases with reaction time and reaches the maximum (71%) in 3h almost does not change afterwards. At optimized reaction conditions; 100°C, aniline to DMC molar ratio of 1:10, catalyst weight 0.8g and total reactant weight 16g, the conversion of aniline was found to be 99% with 71% selectivity for MPC after 3h. In order to check the leaching of framework Al into the reaction mixture during the course of the reaction, reaction was carried out for 2h under selected reaction conditions. The reaction was then stopped and catalyst was separated by filtration of hot reaction mixture and same reaction mixture was stirred further 6h. The results are shown in the (Fig. 6 ). It was found that in the absence of the catalyst, there was no further increase in the conversion of aniline, which indicated the absence of leaching of Al. The above study ensured that the methoxycarbonylation is purely a heterogeneously catalyzed reaction. The recyclability of AlSBA-15 (10) catalyst was tested in the synthesis of MPC from DMC and aniline by conducting five runs (∼86% conversion after 2h) using selected reaction conditions. After each run, the catalyst was repeatedly washed with DMC, dried at 120°C for 2h and calcined at 550°C in air for 4h. It was then used with a fresh reaction mixture. The result is shown in (Fig. 7 ). It was found that the conversion of aniline was practically the same in all the five cycles. 4 Conclusions Here, we are reporting an environmentally benign method for synthesizing methyl phenyl carbamate from dimethyl carbonate and aniline using mesoporous AlSBA-15 as solid acid catalyst. AlSBA-15 was successfully synthesized by isomorphous substitution of aluminium into SBA-15 framework, which induces the Brönsted and Lewis acid sites in the material. Compared to other conventional catalyst system, AlSBA-15 showed higher catalytic activity due to its larger pore diameter, which could make the acid sites better accessible for the substrates.
