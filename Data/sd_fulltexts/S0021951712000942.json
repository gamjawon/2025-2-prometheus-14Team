Fax: +49 40 42838 9174. Graphical abstract Water is oxidized at pH 7 at nanoporous Fe2O3 electrodes. The current density increases linearly with the pore diameter. Highlights ► Nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide is coated with iron(III) oxide by atomic layer deposition. ► The resulting electrode displays an enhanced specific surface area. ► It is stable upon electrochemical water oxidation at pH 7. ► The pore diameter is tuned systematically. ► The current density increases linearly with the specific surface area. A catalyst surface for the electrochemical oxidation of water at neutral pH is prepared by carrying out the atomic layer deposition of Fe2O3 from ferrocene and ozone onto a substrate. A flat reference substrate is compared with well-defined nanostructures created by anodization. Anodized aluminum serves as a template with ordered, parallel cylindrical nanopores, so that after atomic layer deposition of iron oxide the electrode features an enhanced surface area. Because the geometric parameters of the pores are accurately tunable, their effect on the electrocatalytic current can be studied systematically. We show that when the pore diameter increases, all other parameters being kept constant, the electrochemical current density increases linearly with the specific surface area of the sample. Thus, this work demonstrates the suitability of the preparative procedure for creating well-defined model structures that allow for the systematic investigation of mass transport effects in solution in the vicinity of nanostructured electrodes.

Thus, the delicate design of an efficient oxidation catalyst is fundamental to photosynthesis in biological systems and is also the approach mostly adopted by chemists to develop an efficient artificial counterpart [1–6]. However, bringing distributed, renewable energy sources to the non-legacy world in the form of an artificial photosynthesis will imply the exclusive use of cheap, abundantly available materials, instead of the most advanced catalysts. In this perspective, another optimization strategy is required. In this work, we demonstrate that the efficiency of Fe2O3 (hematite [7,8]) electrodes for the oxidation of water at pH 7 can be increased by at least an order of magnitude solely by tuning the geometry of the surface on the sub-micrometer scale. We provide a model system in which the structure of the electrode is very accurately controlled: it consists of straight cylindrical pores, the length and diameter of which can be experimentally varied independently. With this, we can follow how the electrocatalytic current varies with the specific surface area in a quantitative and systematic manner. This was not possible in systems investigated previously, which were based on nanostructures with less accurately defined geometries. Indeed, to date, particularly interesting results have been obtained with systems such as Si-doped Fe2O3 dendrites [7,9], oxygen-deficient Fe2O3 nanoleaves [10], nanoporous anodic Fe2O3 films [11], clustered Fe2O3 nanocolumns [12], or supported Fe2O3 nanonets [13]. In all of those cases, the authors linked the high electrocatalytic activity to the large specific area obtained by nanostructuring. The claim is reasonable; however, a direct, systematic investigation of how the measured current depends on the surface microstructure has been missing. This situation is due to the lack of a suitable experimental model system—a surface featuring simple, geometric nanostructures (such as rectangular trenches or cylindrical columns) with tunable parameters. The present article fills this gap. We consider a simple electrode geometry of cylindrical nanopores defined by two clear structural parameters (the pore length and its diameter), which we can tune accurately. Our preparative method combines atomic layer deposition (ALD) with an appropriate porous template, a strategy that is quite generally applicable [14–19]. Using this model system, we were able to record directly how the current density of water oxidation varies when the specific surface area of the iron oxide electrode is increased. We note that ALD is compatible with industrial manufacturing. It has already been adopted in the semiconductor industry, as well as others. Accordingly, batch reactors are commercially available currently for the ALD coating of >1m2 of substrate. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials Water was purified immediately before use in a Millipore Direct-Q system. Phosphoric acid, copper(II) chloride dihydrate, nickel(II) chloride hexahydrate, nickel(II) sulfate hexahydrate, chromium(VI) oxide, ferrocene, ethanol, hydrochloric acid, perchloric acid, boric acid, and KH2PO4 were purchased from Strem, Sigma Aldrich or Alfa Aesar and used as received. Aluminum plates (99.999%) were purchased from Goodfellow. Si(100) wafers covered with an oxide layer were purchased from Si-Mat. 2.2 Sample preparation Anodization was performed in home-made two-electrode cells based on a PVC beaker containing the electrolyte. One or several circular openings are at the bottom of the beaker, under which aluminum plates of 2- or 4-cm diameter are held between an O-ring and a thick copper plate functioning as electrical contact. The cell is closed with a lid that holds a silver wire mesh as counter-electrode and a mechanical stirrer. The copper plate is in contact with a cold plate connected to a closed-circuit cooler by Haake, whereas the setup is thermally insulated laterally. The aluminum plates were first electropolished for 4min under +20V in a solution prepared by mixing one part HClO4 (70%) with three parts of EtOH. They were subsequently rinsed, cooled, and anodized under +195V for 3h at 0°C in 0.5wt.% H3PO4, then for 9–15h at 1°C in 1wt.% H3PO4. The oxide was removed by stirring in a chromic acid solution (0.18M CrO3 in 6wt.% H3PO4) for 4h at 45°C. The second anodization was carried out for 15–120min under 195V at 1°C in 1wt.% H3PO4. The pores were then widened in 10wt.% H3PO4 at 45°C for 0–60min. The samples were then taken out of the electrochemical cells and coated either with Au (3min, 30mA) in a sputter coater (108auto) by Cressington or with ITO (20min, 125W) in an AC/DC sputter coater by Torr. For the electroplating of the thick metal layer, the samples were adjusted back into the electrochemical cells, which were filled with the electrolyte and fitted with a platinum mesh as counter-electrode. Nickel was electrodeposited from the standard Watts electrolyte (300gL−1 NiSO4·6H2O, 45gL−1 NiCl2·6H2O, 45gL−1 H3BO3) and gold from a commercial Auruna 5000 solution purchased from Umicore Electroplating. They were coated at −2V under stirring until a thickness of several micrometers was reached, then rinsed and turned upside down in the PVC cells. The aluminum metal remaining on the backside was then removed by a 0.7-M CuCl2 solution in 10% HCl. The barrier layer of oxide closing the pore extremities was then removed by reactive ion etching for 30min at 250W in a Sentech SI220 reactor with 50 sccm CF4 and 5 sccm O2 and under 12mTorr. As final step in the preparation, the atomic layer deposition of Fe2O3 was conducted at 200°C from ferrocene and ozone, either in a Savannah 100 reactor by Cambridge Nanotech or in a home-built hot-wall reactor. Ferrocene was delivered from the powder heated to 100°C, and ozone was generated from dioxygen in an OzoneLabs generator set to its maximal power. In the Cambridge Nanotech reactor, the ALD deposition was carried out in exposure mode with 2s pulse, 25s exposure, and 35-s pump durations for ferrocene and 0.3s, 25s, and 30s for ozone, respectively; in the home-built reactor, the times were set to 2/35/50s and 0.3/35/45s. In these conditions, 500 ALD cycles correspond to approximately 10nm of Fe2O3. The structures were examined in a Zeiss Evo scanning electron microscope. High-resolution scanning electron microscopy as well as X-ray fluorescence investigation (EDX) was carried out on a Zeiss Sigma. 2.3 Electrolyses Pieces of the samples were cut with a razor blade and mounted into an electrochemical cell (schematically presented as Fig. S1 in the Supplementary material) similar to those described above, where the copper plate on which the sample lies was contacted as working electrode. This cell differed from those above by the use of platinum as counter-electrode, the absence of mechanical stirring and thermal insulation, and the size of the orifice exposing the sample to the electrolytic solution (6-mm diameter). A magnetic stir bar and a reference electrode (Ag/AgCl/KCl(sat) from BASi) were added. All experiments were carried out with a Gamry Reference 600 potentiostat and in a phosphate electrolyte prepared from 0.1M KH2PO4 and adjusted to pH 7. For each sample, internal resistance measurement and cyclic voltammogram were first carried out without stirring, and then the stirring was set to ∼1Hz for bulk electrolyses. The internal resistance of the overall setup was on the order of 200–300Ω for all samples. All current densities reported in the paper were measured after at least 12h of electrolysis. Part of the dioxygen evolved (approximately 50% of the volume expected based on the integrated current) could be collected by an inverted cylinder filled with electrolyte and held above the working electrode. 2.4 Flat reference sample A 200-nm-thick layer of indium tin oxide (ITO) was deposited onto a piece of silicon wafer by AC sputtering, and then atomic layer deposition of Fe2O3 was carried out as described above. The electrical contact between the Fe2O3/ITO film and the underlying copper plate for electrolysis was ensured by several points of silver paste. The electrolyte did not come in direct contact with the silver paste. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Preparation and characterization The preparative procedure is delineated in Scheme 1 . The repeated electrochemical oxidation (“anodization” [20]) of aluminum under 195V in 1% H3PO4 at 0°C delivers an Al2O3 layer featuring cylindrical pores of length L, which is solely defined by the anodization time. The lateral period Dp of the hexagonal arrangement of parallel pores is approximately 480(±50)nm. Other applied voltages and acids would yield different values of Dp [21]. The pores of diameter 140(±20)nm initially are widened up to a maximum of 360(±20)nm by an isotropic thermal etching in an acid, and then a thin electrically conductive layer (normally 20nm Au, alternatively ∼200nm indium-doped tin oxide, ITO) is sputtered onto the sample surface. This contact is subsequently used for the electrodeposition of a thick (∼20μm) metallic film (normally nickel, alternatively gold) serving as an electrical contact and as a mechanical support. Nickel is plated from a standard nickel/boric acid electrolyte and gold from a commercial solution. At this point, the underlying aluminum substrate is removed in an acidic CuCl2 solution: the thin, brittle alumina layer is supported by the robust metal film. The barrier layer of oxide still closing the pore extremities is then removed by reactive ion etching (RIE) in an O2/CF4 plasma. The final step is the conformal coating of the three-dimensional structure with the catalyst Fe2O3 by ALD. This wide-bandgap semiconductor also sustains the electrical current on the short distances involved here. Using the well-established oxidation of ferrocene by ozone at 200°C [22], the thickness d of Fe2O3 can be set accurately (500 ALD cycles corresponding to 10nm), whereby the pore diameter is reduced to its final value D. This reaction is adequate for the conformal coating of extremely elongated pores (we have demonstrated homogeneous coatings in structures of aspect ratio 100–1000); therefore, we are confident that the pores are completely coated. The material deposited with this reaction is nanocrystalline α-iron(III) oxide, hematite, by X-ray diffraction. Fig. 1 presents a typical sample prepared with this method. A lustrous, homogeneously black membrane of several centimeters in diameter is obtained (Fig. 1a), which at the microscopic scale possesses a hexagonal arrangement of parallel pores (Fig. 1b). The yellow–brown color of Fe2O3 is evident on the circular Al frame that holds the membrane, which can be removed subsequently. In the X-ray fluorescence spectrum of the sample (EDX), the most prominent peaks can be attributed to the elements Al, O, Fe, Ni, and Au, as expected. Traces of C and F are also detected, which can be attributed to remnants of oxalate ions in the alumina matrix from the anodization and to the RIE procedure, respectively. A quantitative analysis of the EDX data is not possible due to the heterogeneous nature of the sample and the large sampling volume of the method. A flat reference sample is obtained by sputtering a layer of ITO onto a piece of Si wafer, then covering it with Fe2O3 by ALD. Gold cannot be used here as electrical contact due to its poor adhesion on the silicon surface. In a control experiment, we have checked that a comparatively insignificant electrocatalytic activity is obtained before the ALD of Fe2O3. 3.2 Electrochemical activity For electrochemical experiments, samples were cut and mounted in a home-made electrochemical cell sketched in the Supplementary material (Fig. S1), in which the sample faces the electrolytic solution on a 0.30-cm2 area of its Fe2O3 side and lies on a copper plate on its Ni side. This macroscopic surface area of 0.30cm2 is used in the definition of the effective current density J reported in the graphs. The auxiliary electrode and the reference consisted of Pt mesh and Ag/AgCl/KCl(sat), respectively. All measurements were carried out at neutral pH in an aqueous phosphate buffer. No internal resistance compensation was carried out, and the potentials E reported hereafter are uncorrected. The effect of the electrode porosity is evident in a cyclic voltammogram when a freshly prepared structured sample is directly compared with a flat reference (Fig. 1c): the current is significantly higher in the former case. We also note the presence of a background current and a slightly hysteretic behavior. We attribute both to capacitive and/or pseudo-capacitive effects, which have been well documented for various transition metal oxide surfaces, including those of iron oxides [23–27]. The nanoporous electrodes are stable upon prolonged electrolysis—in fact, the current always increases over the first few hours before reaching a stable value. We note that the Pt auxillary electrode is unrelated to this slow current increase: In a control experiment, a sample was subjected to electrolysis with first a glassy carbon counter-electrode, and subsequently one made of platinum, and no differences were observed (Fig. S2). A more likely cause of it is the initial incorporation of water and/or anions into the oxide structure, since the effect of hydroxide and phosphate groups bound in such solids and at their surface is documented for oxygen evolution [28–31]. The morphology and the composition of the surface were investigated before and after 15h of electrolysis at +1.3V vs. reference. No significant differences are observed at the microscopic scale (Fig. 3). In terms of element analysis, the EDX spectra are essentially identical before and after electrolysis, except for a lower fluorine signal and somewhat more elevated gold and nickel integrals (Supplementary material). In a control experiment, we checked that after 24h of continuous electrolysis of typical samples, neither the electrolyte volume nor its pH value had changed significantly. In the following, all current densities reported have been taken after at least 12h of electrolysis. This long preliminary equilibration time ensures that a steady value of the current density is reached. The I–V curve of one electrode is displayed in Fig. 2 , whereby each datapoint was taken after an additional 2h at the given potential. No hysteretic behavior appears. The average inverse slope of the curve (Tafel slope) is 280mV, which corresponds to an electrochemical transfer coefficient α =0.21. This low value is in line with previous observations of porous systems. More specifically, it is in quantitative agreement (within uncertainty) with the theoretical value α =0.25 predicted analytically for porous electrode surfaces [32]. Several samples can now be compared that feature the same pore length (L =1μm) and same distance between the pore centers (480(±50)nm), but various diameters D varying from 125(±30)nm to 340(±40)nm, as displayed at the top of Fig. 4 . Those seven samples are obtained by isotropic pore widening in H3PO4 (second step of Scheme 1) for various times t, 0min⩽ t ⩽60min. The experimentally determined curve D(t) is shown in the Supplementary material (Fig. S3). Further etching results in the coalescence of neighboring pores and the collapse of the structure (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary material). The systematic change in D results in a linear increase in the effective current density J (Fig. 4). Significantly, extrapolating the curve to D =0μm does not result in zero current. This is expected because in the absence of pores, the sample surface reaches the (non-zero) macroscopically defined area. Indeed, the flat reference sample (red datapoint) fits the trend nicely. More interestingly, no plateau of the electrochemical activity is obtained at large values of the pores’ aspect ratio, which would be indicative of a situation limited by mass and/or charge transport to the interface. This observation can be rationalized if we consider the poor intrinsic catalytic activity of Fe2O3. The interfacial reaction is rate-limiting, so that any increase in the catalyst surface area is directly reflected in the overall turnover frequency. The linear relationship between the diameter D of a cylinder and the geometric area of its lateral surface is thus translated in the curve J(D). Table 1 summarizes our results and puts them in a broader perspective. In order to facilitate the comparison of various current density values J reported in the literature at different applied potentials E with respect to different reference electrodes and at different pH values, we show current densities along with the overpotentials η at which they were recorded, η = E – E°(O2/H2O)+0.060V×pH (where E°(O2/H2O)=1.23V). At an overpotential of 0.59V, structuring our Fe2O3 surface results in a performance improvement by an order of magnitude with respect to the flat sample. This performance is by no means close to that of iridium hydroxide [28], but it compares favorably with some of the cobalt spinels reported [29,33]. Nocera’s cobalt phosphate still fares better than the systems presented here [31], but his more recent, less expensive nickel borate catalyst yields current densities analogous to those obtained here from iron oxide [34]. 4 Conclusions With this, we have established a model system based on iron(III) oxide for the oxidation of neutral water that is stable over prolonged periods of electrolysis and in which (a) the electrode surface can be structured on the sub-micrometer scale, (b) each geometric parameter of the structure can be tuned independently of the others, (c) the electrocatalytic current density linearly depends on the electrode’s specific surface area, and (d) the Tafel slope has the value predicted for porous electrodes. This system must be considered above all as a proof of principle, which can be further expanded or modified for systematic fundamental studies pertaining to mass and charge transport to and from an interface in electrocatalysis. Furthermore, the preparative method is limited neither to an Fe2O3 active layer nor to the oxidation of water. The model system developed here is applicable to any electrochemical and photoelectrochemical transformation that could benefit from improvements in the surface structure. Additionally, the current densities measured here with sub-optimal electrode geometries are comparable to some of the flat state-of-the-art catalysts (Table 1). In other words, structuring a poor catalyst is a means of bringing it closer to the performance of an inherently more active catalyst. From this starting point, the data presented in Fig. 4 provide us with the tools needed to optimize our electrode: its oxygen evolution activity can be maximized based on the geometry and investigated at lower values of the applied potential. Thus, in the next step, the photoelectrochemical activity of the system must be investigated and maximized. Certainly, this will also imply a fine tuning of the Fe2O3 layer in terms of thickness, chemical composition [9,35–38], crystallinity, and morphology. Eventually, for any given electrochemical transformation and corresponding electrocatalyst material, increasing the electrode’s specific surface area by elongating the pores and increasing their density (with concomitant diameter reduction) will lead to a point at which the current density is no longer determined by the chemical constraints of catalytic turnover, but by the physical limit of mass transport in solution. This diffusion limit is common to all catalysts. In other words, the present work drafts a strategy for bringing electrodes based on low-cost, low-quality catalyst materials to a level of efficiency similar to what more elaborate catalyst types may offer. This could be of interest if distributed energy conversion is to become more widespread in the form of electrolyzers, fuel cells, and flow batteries, for example.
