Tel.: +82 32 860 7474; fax: +82 32 860 8908. Graphical abstract Overpotentials for both charge and discharge can be controlled by catalyst composition. A rechargeable Li–air battery was studied using various carbon-supported metal-alloy catalysts as an air electrode. Carbon-supported Pt–Pd, Pd–Ir and Pt–Ru catalysts were prepared by an impregnation–reduction method. For comparison, carbon-supported Pt (Pt/C), Pd (Pd/C), Ir (Ir/C), and Ru (Ru/C) catalysts were also prepared by the same method; physicochemical characterizations were carried out using X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The prepared catalysts were subsequently cast onto both nickel foam and GDL to be evaluated as air cathodes in Li–air batteries. Charge–discharge tests were carried out using a Swagelok-type cell, with both 1M LiPF6 in PC:EC:DEC (3:2:5) and 1M LiPF6 in TEGDME used as an electrolyte. Cycling performance and impedance tests were also conducted. The initial charge–discharge tests showed that alloying two different metals is an effective technique for decreasing the charging voltage. Among all electrodes tested, the Pt–Ru/C electrode was shown to possess a stable cycle performance and the highest round-trip efficiency. Keywords Li–air battery Air electrode Metal-alloy catalyst Charge–discharge cycling 1 Introduction Recently, there has been growing interest in high-capacity-based new energy-storage devices to meet today's energy and environmental demands. Rechargeable lithium–air (Li–air) batteries are an attractive electrochemical power source because their theoretical capacities are several times higher than those of lithium-ion batteries [1–3]. Li–air batteries can be divided into two different types, according to the nature of the electrolyte, i.e., aqueous-based and non-aqueous-based, batteries, which was first reported by Abraham and Jiang [4]. Both systems have attracted a great deal of attention, especially non-aqueous Li–air battery systems, which have garnered more interest around the world in recent years because of their high stability. When a non-aqueous electrolyte is used, the active surface area of the air cathode can be blocked by solid products produced during the discharge process, which eventually leads to a breakdown of the battery by inhibiting the diffusion of air [5,6]. Furthermore, the formation of lithium carbonate compounds by electrolyte decomposition during discharge can result in a shortage of the electrolyte, which leads to a significant performance degradation of Li–air batteries [7]. For the commercialization of Li–air batteries, a great challenge exists in the development of high-performance air cathodes. Air cathodes are known to determine the power, energy density, and energy efficiency of Li–air batteries. The main factor limiting the performances of non-aqueous Li–air batteries is that the voltage gap between the charge and discharge is larger than 1.0V, which results in a low round-trip efficiency (the ratio of discharge to charge voltage) [8]. To reduce these overpotentials, morphology control of the cathode material and optimizing the composition of the catalysts for oxygen reduction reactions and oxygen evolution reactions are highly important challenges that must be addressed. Recently, Li–air rechargeable batteries have been reported, employing MnO2 as a catalyst in air electrodes [1,9]. However, an excessively high-charge overpotential prevents the application of this cheap and abundant material in efficient rechargeable batteries. Dispersing metal catalysts on MnO2 surfaces has been attempted to decrease the charge voltage. Very recently, carbon-supported Pt and Au catalysts have been found to affect the charge and discharge voltages of rechargeable Li–air batteries [10]. However, data were collected only for a short period, and the cyclability was not addressed. In this paper, various carbon-supported metal-alloy catalysts (Pt–Pd/C, Pd–Ir/C, and Pt–Ru/C) were synthesized by an impregnation–reduction method, and employed as air cathode catalysts for rechargeable Li–air batteries. In order to investigate the alloying effect, single-metal-supported catalysts (Pt/C, Pd/C, Ir/C, and Ru/C) were also prepared, and the charge–discharge performances were tested. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of catalysts Carbon-supported Pt–Pd, Pd–Ir, and Pt–Ru catalysts were prepared by an impregnation–reduction method. Chloroplatinic acid hydrate (H2PtCl6·xH2O), palladium(II) chloride (PdCl2), iridium(III) chloride hydrate (IrCl3·xH2O), and ruthenium(III) chloride hydrate (RuCl3·xH2O) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. First, the desired precursor was dissolved in deionized water; in a separate, flask, a carbon support (Vulcan XC-72, Cabot International) was dispersed in deionized water with ultrasonication for 1h. The precursor mixture solution was added dropwise to the carbon-dispersed aqueous mixture with vigorous stirring. The pH value of the solution was then adjusted to 8 with 1M sodium hydroxide solution, maintaining the temperature at 80°C. Aqueous 0.5M NaBH4 was added dropwise to the solution, with the suspension maintained at 80°C for 2h, with stirring. After the solution was cooled to room temperature, it was aged for 12h with continuous stirring. The resultant mixture was filtered and washed with deionized water to remove traces of acid, and then dried in an oven overnight at 80°C. The total metal content was 44wt% for all catalysts, and in the case of alloys, the ratios of the two metals were 1:1. For comparison, 44wt% carbon-supported Pt (Pt/C), Pd (Pd/C), Ir (Ir/C), and Ru (Ru/C) catalysts were also prepared by the same method. 2.2 Physical characterization The crystallinities of the synthesized carbon-supported metal-alloy catalysts were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Rigaku, D/max-2200) using Cu Kα radiation as an X-ray source. The synthesized catalysts were scanned at 1°/min from 20° to 90°. The morphologies and metal dispersions of the prepared catalysts were examined by field-emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM; JEOL, JEM-2100F). 2.3 Preparation of air electrode and cell assembly All air electrodes tested were prepared with a catalyst loading of 1.1–1.3mgcm−2 by casting inks onto either a nickel foam or GDL (10BC, SIGRACET®). For nickel foam, the catalyst ink was prepared by mixing the synthesized catalyst with poly(vinylidene fluoride) (Alfa Aesar) as a binder, with a weight ratio of 9:1, in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone solvent. After sonication for 1h, the resultant slurry was cast onto nickel foam, followed by drying in an oven overnight. For GDL, the catalyst ink was prepared by dispersing the synthesized catalyst in isopropyl alcohol, and stirred by ultrasonication for 1h. The catalyst ink was then sprayed onto the GDL, and dried in an oven overnight. 2.4 Electrochemical measurements A Swagelok-type cell, assembled in an argon-filled glove box, was used for the electrochemical characterizations. Lithium metal (Sigma–Aldrich, 0.38mm thickness) was used as the anode, and a 1M LiPF6 mixture containing propylene carbonate (PC), ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC), in weight ratios of 3:2:5, was used as the electrolyte for the nickel foam electrode. In addition, 1M LiPF6 in TEGDME (tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether) was used as the electrolyte for the GDL electrode. TEGDME is known to allow for a long cycling life of the Li–air cell with low evaporation [11]. A glass-fiber separator (Whatman, GF/B) was impregnated with the electrolyte. The charge–discharge performance was measured using a potentiostat/galvanostat (Princeton Applied Research, VSP) in the voltage range 2.3–4.5V vs. Li/Li+ at a constant current density of 0.2mAcm−2, while maintaining the cell in an O2 atmosphere. The capacity was normalized by the total weight of the air electrode. In order to investigate cycling tests, 1M LiPF6 in TEGDME was used as an electrolyte, and the charge–discharge capacity was maintained at 700mAhg−1, monitoring the final voltage. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) measurements were obtained when the cathode was fed with oxygen; the spectra were recorded in the frequency range 300kHz to 30MHz. The measurements were made before the charge–discharge cycles, and the impedance data were plotted in a complex plane diagram. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Physical characterization The XRD patterns of the synthesized Pt–Pd/C, Pd–Ir/C, and Pt–Ru/C catalysts are shown in Fig. 1 . The diffraction peak observed at 20–25° for all the synthesized catalysts was attributed to the (002) reflection of the hexagonal structure of Vulcan XC-72 carbon. The diffraction peaks from Pt–Pd/C and Pt–Ru/C at about 39°, 46°, 68°, and 81° can be assigned as the reflections of the Pt (111), (200), (220), and (311) plane, respectively, which represent the typical characteristics of a crystalline Pt FCC phase [12]. The diffraction peaks of Pd showed almost the same FCC crystalline structure as that of Pt. The peak at around 43° is characteristic of the Ru (101) phase [13]. However, no diffraction peak from Ir was found. The lattice parameters and the mean particle sizes derived from the Pt (111) and Pd (111) peaks are summarized in Table 1 . The widths of the Pt (111) and Pd (111) peaks were used to calculate the average crystallite sizes, using Scherrer's equation [16]: d = 0.9 λ B 2 θ cos θ max where d is the average crystallite size, λ is the wavelength of the X-ray (1.54Å for Cu Kα radiation), B 2θ is the full-width at half-maximum, and θ max is the angle corresponding to the peak maximum. As listed in Table 1, the mean particle sizes of Pt–Pd/C, Pd–Ir/C and Pt–Ru/C were measured as 3.773, 4.07, and 3.842nm, respectively. In the Pt–Pd/C catalyst, because Pt and Pd have almost the same FCC crystalline structure [14], the diffraction peaks are slightly shifted to higher 2θ values with respect to the corresponding peaks in the pure Pt catalyst. Compared with the lattice constant of pure Pt (0.3923nm) [15], the lattice constant of the Pt–Pd catalyst decreased as a result of Pt–Pd alloy formation. In the Pd–Ir/C catalyst, the (111) peaks of the Pd–Ir catalyst were slightly shifted to lower 2θ values, compared with pure Pd. The shifts of the peaks to lower angles indicated alloy formation between Pd and Ir, which is caused by the incorporation of Ir in the FCC structure of Pd. Since the radius of the Ir atom is larger than that of Pd, the substitution of Pd with Ir would lead to an expanded unit cell volume. Also, compared with the lattice constant of pure Pd, which is 0.3823nm, the lattice constant of the Pd–Ir catalyst increased as a result of Pd–Ir alloy formation. Similarly, the addition of Ru to the Pt/C catalyst decreased the lattice parameters of the Pt/C catalysts as a result of the Pt (111) peak shifting to higher positions. These results showed that all the synthesized catalysts existed as alloys. The surface morphology and particle sizes of the synthesized catalysts were observed by TEM, as shown in Fig. 2 . Metal nanoparticles were confirmed to be distributed uniformly on the carbon support, despite the high metal loading, and the average size of the particles was determined to be 3–4nm. Pd–Ir/C was found to have the largest size, while Pt–Pd/C possessed the smallest nanoparticle size, which is consistent with the XRD results shown in Table 1. 3.2 Electrochemical characteristics of Li–air cell The charge–discharge behaviors of Li–air batteries were investigated using the prepared catalysts as air electrodes. Charge–discharge measurements were carried out in the potential window 2.3–4.5V versus Li/Li+ at a current density of 0.2mAcm−2. Fig. 3 compares the initial performances of the metal catalysts and metal-alloy catalysts. Because Vulcan XC-72 was used as a carbon support, which has a low surface area (250m2 g−1), the capacity was comparatively low. Fig. 3(a) compares the initial capacities for charging and discharging of Ru/C, Ir/C, Pt/C, and Pd/C electrodes. Among the catalysts tested, the Ru/C catalyst showed the highest capacity and the lowest charge–discharge overpotential. The initial charge–discharge behaviors of the metal-alloy catalysts are represented in Fig. 3(b). The alloy catalysts showed different characteristic behaviors from those of the pure metal catalysts. For example, the initial discharge capacity and discharge voltage of a Pt–Pd/C electrode was lower than that of Pd/C, but the charge voltage of a Pt–Pd/C electrode was lower than that of either a Pd/C or a Pt/C electrode. In the case of the Pt–Ru catalysts, the initial charge–discharge behavior (both capacity and overpotential) of Pt–Ru/C was superior to that of either the Pt/C or Ru/C catalysts. Among the catalysts tested, the Pt–Ru/C catalytic system exhibited the highest capacity and the lowest overpotential for both charging and discharging. The initial discharge capacity was observed to be 346mAhg−1 for Pt–Ru/C electrodes, 153mAhg−1 for Pt–Pd/C electrodes, and 135mAhg−1 for Pd–Ir/C electrodes. These results indicate that alloying two types of metals appears to be effective in decreasing the charging voltage and increasing the capacity. To investigate the cyclability of the synthesized catalysts, all the catalysts were cast onto GDL and the final voltage was monitored, maintaining the capacity at 700mAhg−1 for both charging and discharging. For comparison, the cell performance with non-catalyzed GDL as an air electrode was also investigated. For this experiment, 1M LiPF6 in TEGDME was used as an electrolyte instead of 1M LiPF6 in PC:EC:DEC (3:2:5), because carbonate-based electrolytes tend to be volatile and are easily decomposed during cycling. It has been reported that the use of the volatile TEGDME allowed enhanced cyclability of the Li–air battery without solvent evaporation [16]. Fig. 4 shows the cycling performance of a Pt–Ru/C electrode, maintaining the capacity at 700mAhg−1 for both charging and discharging. The charge–discharge profile remained almost unchanged until the 17th cycle, where the average charge–discharge potential plateaus were approximately 2.66V and 3.86V, respectively. Subsequently, the overpotentials for both charging and discharging were observed to increase rapidly; finally, the cell remained uncharged after the 45th cycle. Fig. 5(a) and (b) compares the final voltages of the alloy catalysts with GDL at a capacity of 700mAhg−1 for both charging and discharging. In the case of discharging, all the catalysts tested exhibited an increase in voltage for the first five cycles, with a voltage decrease thereafter. The voltage increase (overpotential decrease) in the initial stage may be related to reduced polarization resulting from activation of the electrode/electrolyte interface before and after the electrochemical reactions [17]. The discharge potential of non-catalyzed air electrodes (GDL) decreased gradually; after the 15th cycle, the potential decreased drastically, an indication of cell failure. The average discharge potential plateau of the GDL electrode was observed to be about 2.61V, while the charging potential plateau was 4.42V. The difference between the charge and discharge voltages was very high (1.81V). The discharge profile of the Pt–Pd/C electrode remained almost unchanged until the 14th cycle, as shown in Fig. 5(a). After the 15th cycle, the discharge potential plateau rapidly decreased, with termination at the 18th cycle. The average discharge potential plateau of the Pt–Pd/C electrode was observed to be ∼2.66V, while the charging potential plateau was ∼4.16V. Stable cyclability was observed for the Pt–Ru/C electrode up to 40 cycles. Although the discharge voltage decreased with cycle number, the voltage-decreasing rate of the Pt–Ru/C electrode was the slowest [Fig. 5(a) and (b)]. The charging voltage of the Pt–Ru/C electrode decreased until the fifth cycle, followed by a subsequent steady increase. The charging voltage of Pt–Ru/C catalyst was very low compared with those of the other alloy catalysts investigated. Cell failure after the 45th cycle may result from electrolyte instability and deactivation of the Li negative electrode. As the cycle continues, the electrolyte is gradually evaporated, with accumulation of electrolyte-discharge products deposited on the electrode, blocking the active catalytic sites, resulting in a capacity decrease [11,17–19]. Since the anode reaction is known to be extremely fast, the charge–discharge overpotential must be related to the kinetic activation barrier in the air electrode. When an appropriate catalyst is used, the corresponding activation barriers can be effectively reduced for the charge–discharge reaction, minimizing the overpotential [1]. In order to investigate the electrochemical characteristics of a Li–air battery, the EIS was measured. Fig. 6 shows the Nyquist plot of the Li–air cell measured before the cycling process, in the frequency range 300kHz to 30MHz. All plots are similar in shape, with a broad semicircle at the high frequency range and a linear tail at the low frequency range [20]. As reported previously, the major source of battery impedance came from the electrodes, but the Li anode made only a weak contribution to the whole impedance of the Li–air battery system [21]. Therefore, the measured impedance can be reasonably attributed mainly to the air cathode. The ohmic resistances (R s) of all the electrodes were similar, and the charge-transfer resistance (R ct) of the Pt–Ru/C electrode was lower than those of the other electrodes. A charge-transfer resistance (R ct) decrease can increase the ionic conduction path in the electrode, resulting in an increase in cell performance [21]. This enhanced charge–discharge behavior of Pt–Ru catalysts can be explained by the low cell resistance. 4 Conclusions Carbon-supported metal-alloy catalysts were successfully synthesized, and used as air electrodes for rechargeable Li–air batteries. From both XRD and TEM results, it was found that metal nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed on the carbon support. Using metal-alloy catalysts, the charging voltages were decreased and outstanding cycling abilities were achieved. Compared to carbon-supported single-metal catalysts, alloying two types of metals was effective in decreasing the charging voltage. Among all the electrodes tested, the Pt–Ru/C electrode exhibited the lowest charging voltage, and high cyclability for over 40 cycles. Pt–Ru/C electrodes showed a stable cycling performance, including the highest round-trip efficiency and lowest cell impedance. In conclusion, the alloying of different metal catalysts provides an effective way to improve the electrochemical performance of Li–air batteries, and potentially provides excellent catalysts for air electrodes.
