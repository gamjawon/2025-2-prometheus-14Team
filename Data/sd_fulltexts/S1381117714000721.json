Graphical abstract The influence of β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) on the laccase-catalyzed aniline polymerization in sodium bis-(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate (AOT) micellar solution is first presented. Results show that the anionic AOT micelle is compatible with laccase and β-CD also has little negative effect on the expression of the catalytic activity of laccase. β-CD can improve the linearity or conductivity of polyaniline biosynthesized in AOT micellar solution. Component analysis shows that AOT is doped in polyaniline chain while β-CD does not thread on the polyaniline chain. Mechanism analysis indicates that the improvement of the linearity of polyaniline by β-CD is due to steric hindrance close to the ortho-position of aniline, which favors the para-coupled aniline polymerization. Keywords β-Cyclodextrin Laccase Micelle Polyaniline Conductivity 1 Introduction Polyaniline (PANI) is a promising material due to its excellent electrochemical performance and good chemical stability [1] and it has broad applications in anticorrosive coatings, rechargeable batteries, electromagnetic shielding, sensors, etc. [2,3]. Traditionally, conductive PANI is obtained by oxidizing aniline monomer chemically or electrochemically under harsh conditions and usually results in complex by-products [4–6]. The use of biocatalysts for the synthesis of PANI has been therefore tried since 1990s [7]. Enzymes are excellent biocatalysts in living cells, exhibiting high activity and good regioselectivity at room temperature and near-neutral pH. A first attempt to synthesize PANI with enzymes was made by Samuelson et al. [7]. Since then, several other groups have tried enzymatic synthesis of PANI using biocatalysts such as laccase, peroxidase [8–13]. The synthesis of conducting PANI is usually carried out at low pHs, so the activity of the enzymes at low pH remains to be solved. From a practical perspective, water soluble or dispersible conducting PANI is more promising. To this end, many attempts have been made to improve the solubility or processability of PANI, for example, sulfonation of the polymer with fuming sulfuric acid [4,14]. Relatively speaking, amphiphile systems have some advantages in dispersing PANI. These systems are usually formulated with anionic surfactants such as sodium dodecylsulfate [15], sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate [16]. In addition to solubilization, these amphiphilic molecules are shown to act as dopants and templates. As a template, the aggregate formed by anionic surfactants of strong acid type can provide a microenvironment near the surface with the pH a little lower than the bulk solution [17], which is beneficial to aniline polymerization as well as to the expression of the activity of the enzymes mentioned above. Even so, the match of an amphiphile and an enzyme still remains unresolved because different types of anionic surfactants have different negative effects on enzyme activity. Sodium bis-(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate (AOT) is a commercially available common surfactant. Our previous study indicated that the negative effect of AOT on enzyme activity is correlated with its aggregate structure. AOT can form micelle at very low concentrations, which may be able to reduce its negative impact on an enzyme and therefore realize its compatible use with laccase. It has been shown that the conductivity of PANI is related to its chain linearity. The better the linearity is, the better the conductivity will be. Thus, it is crucial to optimize the polymerization conditions to obtain a linear PANI. Cyclodextrins are cyclic oligosaccharides linked with α-d-glucopyranose units through 1,4-glycosidic bond. They have an appearance of truncated cone. Their outer surface is hydrophilic, but their inner cavity is hydrophobic. So cyclodextrins are able to form inclusion complexes with some aromatic organic molecules. It is known that β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) can form an inclusion complex with aniline. If so, the ortho-position of aniline should be shielded and the polymerization of aniline would be para-coupled. So the inclusion complex should favor the linear polymerization. Cyclodextrins and their derivatives have been used in aniline polymerization system [18–22] as solubilizers of PANI or regulators of PANI's morphology (the relevant mechanism is not clear), but no attempt has been made to improve the linearity of PANI with β-CD, especially in the enzyme-catalyzed polymerization systems. In this report, the influence of β-CD on the laccase-catalyzed polymerization of aniline in AOT micelle is investigated, and the relevant mechanism is also discussed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials AOT, laccase and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) were purchased from Sigma Co. Disodium hydrogen phosphate, citric acid and o-phenylenediamine (OPD) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China. β-Cyclodextrin (β-CD) was purchased from Tianjin Kermel Chemical Co. Ltd., China. Aniline (ANI) was purchased from Tianjin Bodi Chemical Co. Ltd., China. d-Dimethyl sulfoxide (99.9%, containing 0.03% (v/v) TMS) (d-DMSO)was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Triply distilled water was used throughout the experiments. 2.2 Measurement of AOT critical micelle concentration A series of AOT solution (10mL) of different concentrations was prepared by dissolving different amount of AOT in disodium hydrogen phosphate-citric acid buffer (200mM, pH 4.2) with or without β-CD. Surface tension measurements were made on a tensiometer (JYW-200B, Chengde Dahua Instrument Co., China) using the ring method at 25°C. Prior to measurement, the AOT aqueous solution was equilibrated for 10min. After every use, the ring was washed with triple-distilled water and dried over a flame. 2.3 Determination of laccase activity The activity of laccase was determined on a UV-2550 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Co., Suzhou, China) at 25°C. Detailed procedures are as follows: A 10mL 0.6mM AOT aqueous solution was first mixed with 80μL laccase stock solution (5mgmL−1), and the mixture was then incubated at 25°C. At a given time, 100μL of the mixture was taken out and mixed with 2900μL of 0.1mM ABTS. The time-dependent change of the absorbance of the oxidation product of ABTS at 420nm was then immediately recorded (the final concentration of laccase was 2×10−8 M). The laccase activity was expressed in mAbs min−1. The stability of laccase in the presence of β-CD was studied as follows. First, 0.0114g β-CD was added to 10mL of 0.6mM AOT aqueous solution. After dissolution, laccase was added and incubated at 25°C. The activity of laccase at different time was monitored according to the above steps. 2.4 Laccase-catalyzed synthesis of polyaniline in AOT micelle In the buffered (200mM, pH 4.2) AOT micellar solution (100mL), 0.1140g β-CD was added. After dissolution, 10μL pure aniline was added. The resulting system was kept in a temperature controlled water bath shaker (150rpm, 25°C). After equilibrium, 800μL laccase stock solution (5mgmL−1) was added to trigger the enzymatic reaction (the final concentrations of the components were 1.0mM, 1.0mM, and 6×10−7 M for ANI, β-CD, and laccase, respectively) .The reaction lasted for 12h to complete the polymerization. At the end of the reaction time, 100mL methanol was added to collapse the micelle. The precipitate was collected by filtration and washed with methanol and water. The final purified product was dried under vacuum. The polymerization system without β-CD was used as control experiment. 2.5 Characterization 2.5.1 UV–vis measurements After 12h polymerization at 25°C, a 3.0mL aliquot of the resulting solution was transferred to a 1cm length quartz cuvette to record its absorption spectra against triple-distilled water on a UV-2550 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Co., Suzhou, China). 2.5.2 Conductivity measurements The dried PANI powder was pressed into a disk (13mm in diameter and ca. 1mm in thickness). The conductivity measurements were carried out using a RTS-8 four-point probe. 2.5.3 FTIR measurements The FTIR spectra of the dried product were obtained using KBr pellet. The FTIR spectra of the samples were collected on Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (VERTEX-70, Bruker Co., Germany). 2.5.4 1H NMR measurements AOT, β-CD and the purified PANI (obtained in AOT/β-CD system) were dissolved in d-DMSO. 1H NMR was recorded on a Bruker 300MHz NMR spectrometer. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 The influence of AOT and β-CD on laccase activity Among the surfactants used for PANI dispersion, the anionic surfactant (sulfate or sulphonate) is preferred. Besides dispersion, these surfactants are also involved in doping. When an enzyme is used as catalyst for PANI synthesis, however, the influence of the surfactants on the activity and stability of the enzyme must be taken into consideration. As reported, sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) affects negatively laccase activity [23]; however, we found that AOT surfactant has less negative effect on laccase activity. The time dependent activity of laccase in a buffered solution spiked with AOT, β-CD, and AOT+β-CD was measured, respectively (results not shown). Compared with the activity of laccase in the buffer, the presence of AOT has little influence on the activity of laccase. β-CD has only slightly negative effect on laccase activity. Even in the presence of both AOT and β-CD, laccase still remains ca. 80% of its original activity after incubation for 12h, which is better than other surfactant system reported in literature [23]. It follows that both AOT and β-CD are compatible with laccase for aniline polymerization. 3.2 The influence of β-CD on the critical micelle concentration of AOT β-CD has an appearance of truncated cone with a hydrophilic outer surface and a hydrophobic inner cavity (Scheme 1 ). It is able to form inclusion complexes with a wide variety of small organic molecules that contain hydrophobic groups. Surfactants have hydrophobic chain, so the influence of β-CD on the critical micelle concentration of AOT was investigated [24] to determine the minimum concentration of AOT needed to form a template (surfactant association system) for aniline polymerization [25]. Fig. 1 shows that the presence of β-CD increases the critical micelle concentration of AOT from 0.22mM to 0.55mM. Consequently, 0.6mM AOT was established as optimum for laccase catalyzed aniline polymerization. 3.3 Laccase-catalyzed polymerization of aniline in the presence of β-CD Fig 2 shows the UV–vis absorption spectrum of the resulting homogeneous green solution after 12h laccase-catalyzed polymerization of aniline. It is shown that there are two absorption peaks at ca. 420nm and ca. 750nm, which are characteristic peaks of conducting PANI [10,26,27]. This result indicates that conductive PANI is successfully synthesized in the presence or absence of β-CD. It is observed that under the same experimental conditions, the system containing β-CD results in a more narrow half width (better monodispersity) and a higher peak height (higher productivity) in the spectra than that without β-CD. More importantly, the maximum peak position with β-CD shifts dramatically (from 705nm to 760nm) indicating more linearity of PANI (better conductivity). For confirmation, the conductivity of the PANI, separated from the reacted system was measured using a four-point probe, and the result demonstrated that the conductivity of PANI obtained in the presence of β-CD (2.29×10−3 Scm−1) is higher than that without β-CD (1.14×10−3 Scm−1). To confirm that β-CD can enhance the linearity of PANI, the FTIR spectra of PANI obtained from different systems were recorded (Fig. 3 ). Curves A and B are the spectra of PANI isolated from polymerization systems with β-CD and without β-CD, respectively. The peaks at 1590cm−1 and 1500cm−1 are characteristic absorption of the quinoid units and the benzenoid units [28,29]. The peak at 1310cm−1 is caused by the CN stretching vibration of aromatic amines. The peak at 1245cm−1 is assigned to the CN+ stretching vibration in the polaron structure of the emeraldine salt of PANI [30], and the peak at 1147cm−1 is due to the stretching vibration of NH+ in the bipolaron structure of the emeraldine salt of PANI [30]. The peak at 830cm−1 is assigned to the CH out-of-plane bending vibration of para-disubstituted aromatic rings [31], and the peaks at 694cm−1 and 753cm−1 are to the CH out-of-plane bending vibrations of ortho-disubstituted aromatic rings [29,32,33]. The ratio of the intensity at 694cm−1 or 753cm−1 to that at 830cm−1 is representative of the linearity of PANI synthesized. Accordingly, the zoomed out figures indicate that the PANI obtained in the presence of β-CD is more linear than that without β-CD. That is, β-CD promotes para-coupled aniline polymerization. In the both FTIR spectra, the characteristic peaks of AOT also appear at 1032cm−1 and 1734cm−1 for the stretching vibration of SO and CO, respectively. However, no characteristic peaks of β-CD could be identified. This indicates that the PANI is doped with AOT, but β-CD is not threaded on the polyaniline chain. To confirm the inference (to rule out any spectral interference), 1H NMR spectra of samples were recorded. For comparison, the 1H NMR of AOT and β-CD were also recorded. Fig. 4a shows the proton signals of AOT. The signals at 3.90ppm, 3.65ppm, 2.94+2.84ppm, 1.49ppm, 1.40–1.15ppm, 0.87+0.84ppm are from protons numbered (A), (B), (C+D), (E), (F), and (G+J) of AOT, respectively. These signals are clearly visible in the 1H NMR spectrum of PANI synthesized in AOT/β-CD system (Fig. 4c, the multiplet signals at 6.8–7.5ppm can be assigned to the protons on the aromatic ring of PANI) [21]; however, no obvious proton signals of β-CD appear at 4–6ppm (the proton signals of β-CD are as follows: 5.74–5.65ppm (O2-H, O3-H), 4.82ppm (C1-H), 4.43ppm (O6-H) and 3.72–3.15ppm (C3-H, C6-H, C5-H, C2-H and C4-H)). These 1H NMR results further demonstrate that the final PANI product contains AOT but has no β-CD. Accordingly, we deduce that the major role of β-CD in the aniline polymerization is to shield the ortho-position of aniline and thereby to prevent PANI branching. 3.4 The mechanism of the influence of β-CD on aniline polymerization In order to figure out the role of β-CD in aniline polymerization, the existing form of aniline before the polymerization was first studied using UV–vis spectroscopy. Fig. 5 shows that the absorbance of aniline at 280nm increases in the presence of β-CD and then levels off after a long incubation time. This suggests that aniline and β-CD form an inclusion complex. The formation of the complex makes the para-coupled aniline polymerization easier than the ortho-coupled one due to steric hindrance. Because of the complexity of the aniline polymerization process, o-phenylenediamine (OPD) (its structure is very similar to aniline) was selected as a model to verify the above speculation. The reaction product of the laccase-catalyzed oxidation of OPD is 2, 3-diamino phenazine (DAP) (a dimer) [34] and its maximum absorption in AOT micellar solution appears at 448nm. The reaction was monitored using a spectrophotometer at 448nm. Fig. 6 shows that whether or not β-CD is present, the formed DAP first increases with time and then levels off, indicating that 300s later, the reaction in the both two systems goes completely; however, the absorbance at the platform (A plat) is different (A plat in curve A is larger than that in curve B). Since β-CD has no effect on the absorption of DAP, the difference in A plat in Fig. 6 is due to the difference in DAP concentration. This could be explained based on steric hindrance. β-CD could form an inclusion complex with OPD, which makes the ortho-position crowded and impedes the dimerization. By analogy, β-CD can shield the ortho-position of aniline favoring para-coupled polymerization. The result that no β-CD is present in the final product can be explained as follows (Scheme 2 ). The protonated aniline (adsorbed on the surface of AOT micelle) deprotonates first and aniline is oxidized by laccase, forming aniline radical cation. The polarity of the benzene ring of the formed aniline radical cation is strong and its hydrophobicity is therefore weak. The polarity increase, together with the competitive binding of AOT's hydrophobic chains, results in removing of β-CD from the aniline radical cation. Because of electrostatic interaction, aniline radical cation is oriented on the surface of anionic AOT micelle. As a result, the para-coupled dimerization is easier to occur than the ortho-coupled one due to steric hindrance. After that, the para-coupled dimer is oxidized by laccase and the oxidized dimer is attacked by β-CD-wrapped aniline, forming para-coupled trimer. At this time, β-CD is also removed from the aniline. The polymerization goes in the manner described above and finally para-directed PANI is obtained. 4 Conclusion The influence of β-CD on the laccase catalyzed aniline polymerization in AOT micellar solution is presented. Results show that the anionic AOT micelle is compatible with laccase and β-CD also has little negative effect on the expression of the catalytic activity of laccase. β-CD can improve the linearity or conductivity of PANI biosynthesized in AOT micellar solution. Component analysis shows that AOT is doped in PANI chain while β-CD does not thread on the chain. Mechanism analysis indicates that the improvement of the linearity of polyaniline by β-CD is due to steric hindrance close to the ortho-position of aniline, which favors the para-coupled aniline polymerization.
