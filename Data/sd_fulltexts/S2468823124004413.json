The synthesis of salicylonitrile is primarily conducted through the salicylamide dehydration method, which commonly employs toxic dehydrating agents for non-catalytic amide dehydration. However, the homogeneous palladium chloride offers a simple and green reaction process with outstanding activity and selectivity towards nitrile. Its high cost and non-recyclability, however, limit its industrial applicability. Here, the conversion of salicylamide to salicylonitrile was successfully achieved using a heterogeneous PdCl2/AC catalyst, prepared via a simple impregnation method with a high specific surface area activated carbon as the support. The PdCl2/AC catalyst demonstrates comparable catalytic activity to the homogeneous PdCl2 catalyst and can be recycled up to 7 times in the synthesis of salicylonitrile. Furthermore, the deactivation mechanisms of the PdCl2/AC catalyst in the synthesis of salicylonitrile were also investigated. The results reveal that main reason for catalyst deactivation is attributed to the reduction of Pd(II) and agglomeration of Pd nanoparticles. This catalytic reaction process catalyzed by the recyclable PdCl2/AC catalyst is environmentally friendly, productive, and possess a great potential for salicylonitrile industrial manufacture.

The extensive scope of its applications encompasses pharmaceutical manufacturing, pesticide production, synthetic fibers, functional polymer materials, and other industrial sectors [5-9]. The potential prospects for the application market of 2-hydroxybenzonitrile appear extensive. Various methods have been developed for the synthesis of nitriles utilizing diverse strategies, encompassing multiple bond addition reactions, amine oxidation, dehydration or rearrangement of oximes and amidoximes, dehydration or water shuffling with amides, as well as aldehyde reactions [10]. The nitriles synthesis through the dehydration of primary amides method is renowned for its exceptional chemo-selectivity, compared with the other approaches. The traditional method uses stoichiometric acid reagents (such as P4O10 [11], POCl3 [12], SOCl2 [13-14], etc.) and basic reagents (such as NaBH4 [15]) as dehydrating agents to promote the non-catalytic dehydration of amide. These processes inevitably produce harmful compounds, including extensive additives and solvents, especially the use of toxic agents such as phosphorus oxychloride, phosphorus pentachloride and phosgene [16-17]. The synthesis of nitriles via catalytic dehydration of amide represents an environmentally friendly and effective pathway [18]. The palladium-catalyzed dehydration of amides utilizing acetonitrile as a dehydrating agent is renowned for its exceptional high efficiency and remarkable compatibility with various other functionalities [19-20]. The first instance of PdCl2-catalyzed reversible conversion of primary amides to nitriles in an aqueous acetonitrile solvent was reported by Maffioli et al. [21] Therewith, Okabe et al. reported the dehydration of primary amides to nitriles was catalyzed by palladium, employing dichloroacetonitrile as a water acceptor [22]. Al-Huniti et al. presented the dehydration of amides to the corresponding nitriles was achieved in good yields (72–96 %) by using a trinuclear palladium (II) complex with a very low catalyst loading (0.5 mol%) in an aqueous acetonitrile solvent, and Selectfluor as an oxidant were essential [23]. Despite great effort being made in highly efficient homogeneous Pd catalyst, the intrinsic problems of homogeneous catalysts, such as separation and recycling of the catalysts, hinder its success in practical industrial applications [24-26]. Various heterogeneous reusable Pd catalysts have been extensively employed in a diverse array of organic synthesis reactions, encompassing hydrogenation, oxidation, Heck reactions, and Suzuki coupling reactions [27-32]. To achieve desirable recyclability, nano Pd species are loaded onto appropriate solid supports such as carbon materials [27], metal oxide [28], silica [29], zeolite [30], or organic polymers [31-32]. However, the majority of research efforts have focused on developing supported palladium nanoparticle catalysts. Immobilizing homogeneous Pd catalysts, such as Pd salts or Pd organic complexes, remains a formidable challenge due to the pressing need for maintaining their intrinsic activity when loading the Pd salts or Pd organic complexes on to the solid support. Immobilizing homogeneous catalysis onto solid materials through methods such as covalent grafting, electrostatic interaction, and encapsulation, has attracted extensive research attention because of the advantages of easy product purification, facile separation and recycling of the catalyst, and easy handling for the large-scale production [33]. For example, Xiang et al. provide an organic-inorganic hybrid chiral catalyst by grafting a chiral tartaric acid derivative onto the surface of MCM-41 material for the heterogeneous asymmetric epoxidation of allyl alcohol [34]. Bai et al. constructed an efficient solid heterogeneous catalysts by encapsulation of Cr(Salen) and pyridine in the nanocages of mesoporous silica for kinetic resolution of terminal epoxides [35]. Zhong et al. integrated Co(salen) with porous organic frameworks to developing a solid catalyst for epoxide hydration [36]. Li et al. prepared a high-performance and recyclable propylene oxide hydration catalyst by polymerizing a layer of polymers with Co(salen) catalyst on the outer surface of CNTs [37]. Inspired by these exciting development, it is anticipated to develop an effective heterogeneous Pd catalyst for catalytic dehydration of salicylamide to salicylonitrile. Herein, a heterogeneous PdCl2/AC catalyst prepared via simple electrostatic adsorption method by using a high specific surface area activated carbon (AC) as the support was successfully applied for the conversion of salicylamide to salicylonitrile and compared with homogeneous PdCl2 catalyst. The deactivation mechanism of the PdCl2/AC catalyst in the synthesis of salicylonitrile were also investigated by N2 physical adsorption, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) etc. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Palladium chloride (PdCl2, 99 %) was purchased from Beijing Huaweileco Chemical Co., Ltd., and salicylamide was purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. Other reagents were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. The selected activated carbon (AC) was wood activated carbon. All materials were analytical grade and used without further refinement. 2.2 Preparation of the Pd catalysts 1 g of palladium chloride powder was dissolved in 2 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid at 60 °C, and then diluted with 38 mL of deionized water to obtain a solution of H2PdCl4 with a certain concentration. The catalysts were prepared by a wet impregnation method to impregnate supports with the solution of H2PdCl4. Firstly, the support was dried at 120 °C for 3 h in an oven before impregnation. The support was impregnated with solution of H2PdCl4 for 12 h at room temperature. Then, the impregnated sample was dried at 60 °C for 8 h to obtain PdCl2/AC catalyst. The catalysts were prepared with a theoretical Pd loading of 1 wt.%. We also used TiO2, SiO2, Al2O3, MC (Mesoporous carbon) and AC-800 as the support to prepare the palladium-based catalyst according to the same steps, in which AC-800 is the activated carbon after heat treatment at 800 °C. 2.3 Measurement of catalytic activities The catalytic performance of Pd catalyst for salicylamide catalyzed dehydration to synthesize salicylonitrile was investigated in a 30 mL sealed pressure-resistant reaction tube. 0.73 mmol salicylamide and 0.385 g PdCl2/AC (S/C = 20) were loaded into sealed reactor with 6 mL 50 % acetonitrile aqueous solution. Upon reaching the desired reaction temperature, the stirring speed is adjusted to 850 rpm in order to mitigate any potential mass transfer resistance. At the end of the reaction, the reactor was rapidly cooled to room temperature, the supernatant was separated by centrifugation and identified and quantified by Shimadzu LC-2030 Plus liquid chromatograph, with C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm) and ultraviolet detector. The filtrate experiment separates the catalyst from the system after 1.5 h of reaction, and the filtrate is then allowed to continue reacting for 5.5 h. The TOFestimated value was calculated based on the yield of salicylonitrile during the initial 20-minute reaction period. The calculation equation used was as below: TOF = nsalicylonitrile/(nsurface metal·t). The ratio of surface-active metals to total metal elements can be roughly estimated as 0.62 based on the mean particle size of PdCl2 in the PdCl2/AC catalyst obtained through transmission electron microscopy. The estimated turnover number (TON) value of the PdCl2/AC catalyst was determined based on the salicylonitrile yield over 7 cycles. The calculation equation used was as below: TON = nsalicylonitrile/(nsurface metal). The stability of the Pd catalyst in the batch reaction was evaluated by multi-cycle experiments. After each reaction, the catalyst was recovered by centrifugation, dried overnight at room temperature, transferred back to the reaction tube after drying at 60 °C, and the substrate was re-introduced under standard reaction conditions for a new catalytic cycle. 2.4 Characterizations The N2 physical adsorption isotherms were obtained on the Quantachrome Autosorb-IQ device at −196 °C. The samples were outgassed for 6 h at 210 °C before measurement. The specific surface area was evaluated according to Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The total pore volume was calculated based on the adsorbed N2 vapor accumulation at a relative pressure of 0.99 and the pore size distribution was determined by the desorption branches of the isotherms using the Non-localized density functional theory (NLDFT) model. The metal loadings were determined by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) on an Agilent 730(OES) instrument. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Rigaku D/Max-2500/pc powder X-ray diffractometer, using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) over the 2θ range from 5 to 80° at a scan speed of 5°·min−1. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images and elemental analysis mapping were performed on Thermofisher FEI Talos F200XG2 instrument. The surface electronic information of elements was obtained from the X-ray photoelectron spectra which were performed on Thermo Scientific K-Alpha using monochromatized Al Kα X-ray (1486.6 eV) as the excitation source. All the XPS spectra were calibrated by C 1 s at 284.8 eV. Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) experiments were carried out on a self-made TPD/R instrument. About 80 mg catalyst was loaded into the U-shape quartz reactor and pretreated at 110 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, the temperature was raised from 50 to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C·min−1 under the flow of H2 (30 mL·min−1) with high purity. Simultaneously, the signals of H2 (m/e = 2) was recorded online by the equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer. Argon temperature-programmed desorption (Ar-TPD) experiments were carried out on the same TPD/R instrument. Firstly, about 80 mg catalyst was loaded into the U-shape quartz reactor and pretreated at 110 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, the temperature was raised from 50 to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C·min−1 under the flow of Ar (30 mL·min−1) with high purity. Simultaneously, the signals of CO (m/e = 28) and CO2 (m/e = 44) were recorded online by the equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalytic performance of heterogeneous PdCl2 catalysts for dehydration of salicylamide to salicylonitrile The catalytic performance of various metal chloride catalysts for the dehydration of salicylamide to salicylonitrile was compared in an acetonitrile-water solution, as presented in Table S1. Among these catalysts, PdCl2 exhibited significantly higher activity and selectivity towards salicylonitrile than the others. Conversely, FeCl3, NiCl2 CoCl2, CuCl2, and RuCl3 showed mostly inactive for salicylamide dehydration under the given reaction conditions (Table S1, entries 1–5). H2PtCl6 and HAuCl4 demonstrated negligible levels of salicylonitrile production despite achieving 13.8 % and 25.2 % conversion of salicylamide respectively (Table S1, entries 6–7). The low selectivity of salicylnitril in the presence of other metal chloride catalysts, such as H2PtCl6 and HAuCl4 etc., may be attributed to the specific properties of metals. These findings are consistent with previous results reported by Marazzi [21]. The catalytic performance of heterogeneous PdCl2 catalysts was tested in dehydration of salicylamide to salicylonitrile in acetonitrile aqueous solution and is compared with that of homogeneous PdCl2 catalyst (Table 1 ). As shown in Table 1, PdCl2 affords a 96.5 % conversion of salicylamide and a 99.8 % yield of salicylonitrile (Table 1, entry 1). The PdCl2/TiO2 and PdCl2/SiO2 catalysts exhibit impressive salicylamide conversion of 97.2 % and 97.4 %, respectively, in the initial utilization (Table 1, entry 2 and 3), which are comparable to that of the homogeneous PdCl2 catalyst (Table 1, entry 1). The obvious advantage of heterogeneous catalysts compared to homogeneous PdCl2 catalysts is their easy recycling. However, their conversion significantly decreases to only 8.7 % and 8.8 %, respectively, in subsequent cycles (Table 1, entry 2 and 3), with no formation of salicylonitrile observed under these conditions. Conversely, the PdCl2/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits an initial conversion of 97.4 % and maintains a respectable conversion of 26.6 % in the subsequent application, resulting in a salicylonitrile yield of 11.4 % (Table 1, entry 4). What's exciting is that the PdCl2/AC catalyst exhibits an initial conversion of 89.1 % and maintained a respectable conversion of 84.3 % in the subsequent application, accompanied by salicylonitrile yields of 75 % and 77.4 %, respectively (Table 1, entry 5). Although the initial conversion of PdCl2/TiO2 and PdCl2/SiO2 catalysts is remarkably high, their activity in subsequent cycles is negligible, suggesting that the initial conversion contribution from the leached Pd species in the acetonitrile aqueous solution. The ICP analysis of the PdCl2/TiO2 and PdCl2/SiO2 catalysts also confirms this result, indicating an almost absence of Pd on the solid material after one use (Table S2). The Pd content after one run is 0.35 % and 0.85 % for the PdCl2/Al2O3 and PdCl2/AC catalyst, respectively. To eliminate the influence of leached Pd species in the acetonitrile aqueous solution on the conversion contribution, a filtrate reaction was conducted at 70 °C with a salicylamide/Pd ratio of 20 for the PdCl2/AC catalyst. The reaction was stopped after 78.2 % consumption of the salicylamide, and the filtrate was immediately isolated through a rapid centrifugation. The filtrate was sequential stirred under the same reaction conditions. However, almost no increase in the conversion is observed for PdCl2/AC catalyst, as well as the filtrate of the PdCl2/AC catalyst is colorless (Fig. S1). This result confirms that the conversion of salicylamide is truly contributed by the solid PdCl2/AC catalyst instead of the leached Pd species in the filtrate. In order to further investigate whether the PdCl2/AC catalyst is influenced by the multistage pore structure of activated carbon or the presence of oxygen-containing groups on carbon surface, a mesoporous carbon with abundant oxygen-containing groups (N2 adsorption-desorption results were shown in Figure S2) and a hierarchical pore structure activated carbon without oxygen-containing groups (oxygen-containing groups were removed through heat treatment at 800 °C, TPD results were shown in Fig. S3) were used as support. The catalytic performance of PdCl2/MC and PdCl2/AC-800 catalyst is listed in entry 6 and 7. The PdCl2/MC catalyst exhibits an initial conversion of 83.0 % and maintains a respectable conversion of 47.3 % and a selectivity of 83.3 % in the subsequent application, resulting in a salicylonitrile yield of 39.1 % (Table 1, entry 6). It is noted that the conversion of the second run for the PdCl2/AC-800 catalyst is observed to be 92.3 %, demonstrating no decrease compared to that of the first run (conversion of 86.6 %, Table 1, entry 7). These results indicate that the hierarchical pore structure of AC plays a more crucial role in maintaining the catalytic activity of the carbon-supported PdCl2 catalyst, surpassing the significance of oxygen-containing groups on the carbon surface. The free PdCl2 is confined within the micropores of activated carbon, which not only maintains its catalytic activity but also renders it a solid heterogeneous catalyst that can be readily separated from the reaction solution. 3.2 Properties of activated carbon and PdCl2/AC catalyst The SEM image in Fig. 1 a reveals the rough surface of the activated carbon, characterized by a fibrous texture. Additionally, the TEM image in Fig. 1b demonstrates the presence of abundant and distinct pore structures, including micropores and mesopores. The surface area and porosity of the activated carbon (AC) were characterized using N2 adsorption-desorption techniques. The specific surface area was determined to be 1831 m2·g −1, while the pore volume measured 1.54 cm3·g −1, as shown in Table S3. As shown in Fig. 1c, AC exhibits a type IV isotherm based on adsorption-desorption isotherm classification of IUPAC, providing evidence of their mesoporous structure. The pore size distribution of the AC was calculated using the NLDFT model, as shown in Fig. 1d. Apart from a predominant pore size distribution around 1.5 nm, activated carbon also possesses mesoporous pores with a diameter of 7.5 nm. The surface oxygen-containing groups of activated carbon were characterized by XPS. The XPS spectral fitting results of the O 1 s peak are presented in Fig. 1e, with fitting peaks of AC samples identified at 531.1 eV, 532.4 eV, 533.4 eV, and 536.5 eV, corresponding to CO, OCO, COH, and H2O adsorbed on the surface, respectively. The XPS surface analysis reveals that AC contains oxygen content is 13.94 %, indicating the existence of various oxygen-containing functional groups, with OCO and COH accounting for 42.2 % and 34.9 % of the total oxygen-containing groups, respectively (Table S4). The TPD experiment further demonstrates the presence of a significant quantity of oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of AC (Fig. S3). These results demonstrate that activated carbon possesses a hierarchical pore structure comprising micropores and mesopores, while also containing an abundance of oxygen-containing functional groups. Fig. 2 a-c show the TEM and HRTEM images of the fresh PdCl2/AC catalysts. For fresh PdCl2/AC catalysts, TEM images revealed the presence of a certain amount of PdCl2 NPs with sizes in the range of 1–3 nm. The average size is about 1.8 nm. The HRTEM image shows that the crystal lattice spacing is 0.236 nm, which is indicative of the PdCl2 (111) plane. The STEM and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) elemental mapping present the coexistence of C, Pd, Cl and O, and the Pd element well separating throughout the entire carbon material indicates Pd species is uniformly distributed within the carbon support (shown in Fig. 2d). Fig. 2e shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the fresh PdCl2/AC catalyst. There is no obvious Pd characteristic peaks but the amorphous diffraction peaks of activated carbon can be observed in the fresh PdCl2/AC catalysts. This is mainly due to the high dispersion of the Pd species on the activated carbon surface or the content of Pd is too low to be detected in the XRD analysis. The composition and chemical structure of the fresh PdCl2/AC catalyst were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as shown in Fig. 2f. Table S5 provides comprehensive information on the binding energy and relative content of the fresh PdCl2/AC catalysts. The XPS data of Pd 3d were well-fitted by decomposing the spectrum into Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2 peaks. As shown in Fig. 2f, the fresh PdCl2/AC catalyst only displayed the Pd 3d5/2 peak at BE of 337.8 eV and the Pd 3d3/2 peaks at 343.0 eV, which is assigned to the Pd(II) species [38]. 3.3 The stability and deactivation mechanism of PdCl2/AC catalysts In order to further demonstrate the stability and recyclability of the PdCl2/AC catalyst. The recyclability of the solid PdCl2/AC catalyst for the dehydration of salicylamide to salicylonitrile was tested 70 °C. The PdCl2/AC catalyst achieves a conversion of over 90 % during the first run. The conversion of salicylamide gradually decreased during the cycle stability test, resulting in a 60 % conversion of salicylamide after 7 cycles (Fig. 3 ). This suggests that the PdCl2/AC catalyst deactivates gradually under these reaction conditions. The turnover number (TON), which quantifies the catalyst's efficiency in converting the starting substrate into the desired product throughout the reaction, is commonly considered alongside product yield and reaction selectivity. However, accurately quantifying the active metal atoms in heterogeneous catalysts poses a significant challenge. Therefore, the yield per unit of Pd is calculated using the total Pd content in the PdCl2/AC catalyst. The PdCl2/AC catalyst demonstrates a significantly higher yield of 101.4 molsalicylonitrile/molPd over 7 cycles compared to the homogeneous PdCl2 catalyst (9.7 molsalicylonitrile/molPd), which can only process a single run. Based on the mean particle size of PdCl2 in the PdCl2/AC catalyst obtained by transmission electron microscopy, the ratio of surface-active metals to total metal elements is roughly estimated to be 0.62. And then, we estimate the TONestimated on the heterogeneous PdCl2/AC catalyst to be 163 and the TON of PdCl2 catalyst is 10. The turnover frequency (TOF), expressed as TON per unit of time, is also a crucial factor. We also calculated the TOFestimated based on the yield of salicylonitrile during the initial 20-minute reaction period. The TOFestimated of PdCl2/AC catalyst is 0.009 s −1, which is slightly lower than that of the homogeneous PdCl2 catalyst (0.014 s −1). There are several deactivation mechanisms that occur in liquid medium for carbon supported metal catalysts, including leaching, fouling/coking, sintering of metal active sites, and the formation of new inactive phases. The Pd content of the fresh and used PdCl2/AC catalysts was measured by ICP-OES, as displayed in Table 2 . The results indicated that the Pd content in the PdCl2/AC catalyst almost unchanged after 7 cycles. The results of filtration experiments, cycling experiments and Pd content analysis of the fresh and used Pd catalyst confirmed that the inactivation of PdCl2/AC is not caused by the loss of active components. The conversion of salicylamide for the PdCl2/AC catalyst is reduced from 94.8 % to 60.2 %, while the Pd content in the PdCl2/AC catalyst remains almost unchanged even after 7 cycles. Therefore, further investigation is required to determine the cause of deactivation in the PdCl2/AC catalyst. N2 adsorption-desorption characterization was utilized to investigate the porosity, which can be seen in Fig. 4 . Both fresh and used PdCl2/AC catalysts exhibit type IV isotherms based on adsorption-desorption isotherm and the pore size distribution of the fresh and used PdCl2/AC catalyst remains unchanged. Meanwhile, the specific surface area is 1807 and 1787 m2·g −1, and the pore volume is 1.50 and 1.47 cm3·g −1, respectively, which is shown in Table S3. The results reveal that the physical structure of the catalyst remained stable with no evidence of carbon deposition or plugging phenomena, even after repeated use of the PdCl2/AC catalyst within these reaction conditions. Fig. 5 a-c show the TEM and HRTEM images of the used PdCl2/AC catalyst. For the used PdCl2/AC catalyst, the large particles (8.1–41.4 nm) are observed in the used PdCl2/AC catalyst (Fig. 5a and b), which is markedly different when compared to the fresh catalyst. The HRTEM images show that the crystal lattice spacing is 0.227 nm, which is indicative of the Pd (111) plane [39] (Fig. 5c). EDS elemental mappings in Fig. 5d are indicating agglomeration /sintering of Pd species distinctly. Fig. 5e shows the XRD pattern of the used PdCl2/AC catalyst, characteristic XRD diffraction peaks associated with Pd0 at 40.0 and 46.5° are clearly observed in the used PdCl2/AC catalysts. These results indicate that the sintering and/or the reduction from PdCl2 to Pd0 of the active components is occurred. Fig. 5f shows the Pd 3d XPS surface analysis of the used PdCl2/AC catalysts. According to the literature, the Pd 3d5/2 peaks at 335.9, and 337.8 eV are assigned to Pd(0), and Pd(II) species, respectively. And the Pd 3d3/2 peaks at 341.3, and 343.0 eV are assigned to Pd(0), and Pd(II) species, respectively [38]. An increase of the peak intensity of Pd(0) at 335.9 eV is evident that the used PdCl2/AC catalyst presents a large amount of Pd(0) species (approximately 19.5 %), indicating that partial Pd(II) species were reduced into Pd(0) during the dehydration of salicylamide. The peak fitting of the Cl 2p orbit at 198.4 eV can be attributed to the Cl 2p3/2 orbits of Pd-Cl, respectively and the Cl peaks at 200.4 eV are assigned to CCl [40]. As shown in Fig. 6 a, the Cl 2p orbital binding with metal was disappeared after the PdCl2/AC catalyst is used, only the presence of CCl was observed. This result suggested that the PdCl2 is reduced to Pd0 and agglomerated/sintered during the reaction, which is in accordance with the XRD result. H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was conducted to investigate the chemical state of the fresh and used PdCl2/AC catalysts. The hydrogen consumption peaks at 150 to 350 °C were attributed to the reduction of Pd(II) species. And the obvious hydrogen consumption peak in the range 480–800 °C can be attributed to reduction of the oxygen-containing groups on the carbon surface. It was found by H2-TPR that the reduction peak of the catalyst after use became significantly smaller at 264 °C, as shown in Fig. 6b, indicating that the content of Pd(II) that could be decreased, which is consistent with the conclusion obtained by XPS. According to the above characterization results, the main reasons for the deactivation of PdCl2/AC catalysts is the reduction and sintering of the Pd(II) species. In order to regenerate the Pd catalyst, we conducted an oxidation treatment on the used Pd/AC catalyst using a combination of nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide. Unfortunately, these simple approaches proved ineffective in restoring the used Pd/AC catalyst and resulted in damage to the AC support. Therefore, further efforts are required for successful oxidative regeneration of the catalyst. More extensive endeavors towards regenerating the Pd/AC catalyst will continue in our laboratory. 4 Conclusions In conclusion, a heterogeneous PdCl2/AC catalyst prepared via impregnation method using activated carbon as support was successfully applied for the synthesis of salicylonitrile. PdCl2/AC catalyst exhibits a comparable catalytic activity with homogeneous PdCl2 catalyst and could be recycled 7 times in synthesis of salicylonitrile. Additionally, the deactivation reasons of the PdCl2/AC catalyst in the synthesis of salicylonitrile were also investigated. The results reveal that the main deactivation reason is the reduction of Pd(II) and the agglomeration of Pd nanoparticles. Furthermore, this catalytic reaction process catalyzed by the recyclable PdCl2/AC catalyst is environmentally friendly, productive, and possess a great potential for industrial manufacture.

        "dc:description": "The synthesis of salicylonitrile is primarily conducted through the salicylamide dehydration method, which commonly employs toxic dehydrating agents for non-catalytic amide dehydration. However, the homogeneous palladium chloride offers a simple and green reaction process with outstanding activity and selectivity towards nitrile. Its high cost and non-recyclability, however, limit its industrial applicability. Here, the conversion of salicylamide to salicylonitrile was successfully achieved using a heterogeneous PdCl2/AC catalyst, prepared via a simple impregnation method with a high specific surface area activated carbon as the support. The PdCl2/AC catalyst demonstrates comparable catalytic activity to the homogeneous PdCl2 catalyst and can be recycled up to 7 times in the synthesis of salicylonitrile. Furthermore, the deactivation mechanisms of the PdCl2/AC catalyst in the synthesis of salicylonitrile were also investigated. The results reveal that main reason for catalyst deactivation is attributed to the reduction of Pd(II) and agglomeration of Pd nanoparticles. This catalytic reaction process catalyzed by the recyclable PdCl2/AC catalyst is environmentally friendly, productive, and possess a great potential for salicylonitrile industrial manufacture.",
