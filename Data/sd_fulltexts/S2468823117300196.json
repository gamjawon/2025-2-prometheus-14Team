Graphical abstract Chloroacetanilide herbicides are widely used pesticides in agriculture, resulting in contamination of ground and surface waters. Among the methods studied to enhance their degradation rate, reductive dechlorination is proposed. A [Co(bpy(CH2OH)2)2]2+ complex allowing electrocatalytic reduction of chloroacetanilide herbicides is covalently immobilized on a 3D porous electrode previously functionalized by electrografting methods. Bulk electrolyses performed on alachlor in a flow electrochemical cell show the high catalytic activity of the Co complex, leading to a total reduction of the substrate and a good selectivity toward the formation of the dechlorinated derivative. Interestingly, when it is immobilized, the catalyst is more stable than in solution as shown by the turnover number of more than 360 compared with a value of 4 in solution. Biodegradability on 5days did not show any improvement compared with the starting material, highlighting that even if chlorine atoms that are often responsible for the toxicity of a molecule are removed, the substrate can still have a biorecalcitrant behaviour. The main by-product, deschloroalachlor, was identified and was found to be not biodegradable accounting for this recalcitrance. Keywords Chloroacetanilide herbicides Dechlorination Co catalyst Modified electrodes Biodegradability 1 Introduction Pesticides belong to emerging contaminants and have been largely detected in ground and surface waters [1–5]. The large accumulation of pesticides in continental and marine natural waters [4] is the consequence of the worldwide general application of intensive agricultural methods. In 2001 in the United States, the use of conventional pesticides exceeded 500,000t, for a worldwide usage of 2 million tons [6]. France is the first European consumer of pesticides and the third globally, with 80,000–100,000 tons/year for the last thirty years [7]. The chloroacetanilide herbicides such as alachlor, metolachlor and metazachlor belong to one of the most widespread classes of herbicides used for control of annual grasses and broadleaf weeds in agricultural crops. They have moderate to high chronic toxicity and have been characterized as probable human carcinogen. They also persist for a long time in soil and their residues and degradation metabolites have been frequently detected in ground and surface waters [8–10]. The degradation of chloroacetanilide herbicides is difficult in conventional activated sludge systems and requires specific microorganisms [11,12]. Thus, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been studied for enhancement of their biodegradability. For example, direct photolysis and ozonation of alachlor have proven to be insignificant and slow processes, which nevertheless can be improved by addition of TiO2 [13–15]. Photo-Fenton and Fe(III)/H2O2 Fenton system have proved their efficiency for the degradation of chloroacetanilide herbicides [16–18]. However, the partial degradation of the biorecalcitrant compound can be accompanied by an increase of toxicity, as it has been noticed with alachlor [19]. The enhancement of biodegradability of alachlor has also been achieved by gamma irradiation in the presence of hydrogen peroxide [20]. Oxidation treatments are usually efficient to degrade organic compounds due to the formation of very active hydroxyl radicals but can present some drawbacks for the treatment of chlorinated compounds. Thus, the formation of harmful and hazardous by-products such as inorganic and organic chloramines and perchlorate has been reported during electrooxidation and ozonation processes of chloro-species [21,22]. An inhibitory effect of chloride ions on the Fenton process has also been noticed and attributed to the complexation of Fe(III) in competition with hydrogen peroxide [23–25]. The enhancement of the degradation rate of alachlor by reduction processes has also been reported, especially dechlorination processes, since the presence of chloro groups in the structure of a molecule is known to increase its biorecalcitrance [26]. Thus zero valent iron (Fe00) can promote reductive dechlorination of chloroacetanilide herbicides, to accelerate the remediation of pesticide-contaminated soil [27–29]. Further studies have also shown that FeII sites are also capable of reducing chloroacetanilide herbicides [30–32]. Dechlorination has also been achieved by nucleophile substitution by bisulfite and dithionite, leading to sulfonic acids and thiosulfates, respectively [33–35]. Another approach consists in the hydrodechlorination of alachlor with hydrogen in aqueous phase under relatively mild conditions of temperature and pressure with the use of different carbon supported copper, nickel and palladium catalysts [36]. Although palladium was found as the most active, copper and nickel based catalysts have also shown a reasonably good activity, leading to conversion values in the 80–93% range. Dechlorination involving catalysts has been the subject of numerous studies [37–43]. Whereas molecular catalysts have shown their high catalytic activity for dechlorination processes in organic [10,44–49] as well as aqueous media [50–53], their use in heterogeneous catalysis has not been largely explored [49,51,54] as it is the case with supported metal catalysts [37,39,41–43]. We have recently reported the high catalytic activity of a new bipyridyl cobalt complex containing two bipyridine ligands toward the dechlorination of chloroacetanilide herbicides in aqueous medium, giving rise to a total and selective reduction of alachlor into its dehalogenated derivative, deschloroalachlor (Scheme 1 ) [55]. We took advantage of the high selectivity and efficiency of the catalyst to achieve a flow system for dechlorination of chloroacetanilide herbicides. The Co complex was first covalently immobilized on a porous 3D electrode functionalized by an electrografting method and the performances of the flow cell were tested for dehalogenation of alachlor. Since combined methods have proved their efficiency to mineralize biorecalcitrant compounds [56–59], the feasibility of the combination of this dechlorination process with a further biological treatment was evaluated through biodegradability measurements. 2 Experimental 2.1 Chemicals and materials Alachlor (2-chloro-N-(2,6-diethylphenyl)-N-(methoxymethyl)acetamide) and sodium nitrite were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and deschloroalachlor (N-(2,6-diethylphenyl)-N-(methoxymethyl)acetamide) from Alpha Chimica (France). Graphite felt (Recycled Vein Graphite RVG 4000) was supplied by Mersen (France). Its specific area measured by the BET (Brunauer, Emett and Teller) method, its volume density and its carbon content were 0.7m2 g−1, 0.088gcm−3 and 99.9%, respectively. The synthesis of [Co(bpy(CH2OH)2)2](BF4)2 has been already reported [55]. 2.2 Preparation of the modified electrode 2.2.1 Electrochemical functionalization of the graphite felt 100mg (6.6×10−4 mol) of 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetic acid were dissolved in 100mL of degassed 0.5M HCl. 288mg (4.17×10−3 mol) of sodium nitrite were added at 0°C and the solution was stirred for 20min. Cathodic reduction of the diazonium salts prepared in situ was performed at −0.3VSCE for 10min under nitrogen at room temperature, with a graphite felt (48mm diameter, 12mm thickness) as working-electrode in a flow electrochemical cell [60] (flow rate: 3mLmin−1). Then the derivatized graphite felt was ultrasonicated 3 times in deionized water for 10min and dried under vacuum. 2.2.2 Esterification reaction The functionalized graphite felt was placed in 50mL anhydrous dichloromethane in a reactor under argon at 0°C. 1mL of oxalyl chloride was added and the solution was stirred at room temperature for 18h to prepare the acyl chloride. The felts were rinsed in anhydrous dichloromethane and then dried under vacuum. Then, the electrode was placed in a solution containing 50mL of anhydrous dichloromethane, 1mL of triethylamine and 50mg of [Co(bpy(CH2OH)2)2](BF4)2. The solution was stirred at room temperature for 6 days. The modified electrode was ultrasonicated three times in dichloromethane and once with acetonitrile for 10min. 2.3 Dechlorination conditions The dechlorination reaction was performed in a home-made flow cell [54]. To ensure a good homogeneity of the potential distribution in the three dimensional working electrode [61], the felt was located between two interconnected DSA counter electrodes (dimentionally stable anodes, AC-2004, supplied by ECS International Electro Chemical Services, France). The compartments were separated by cationic exchange membranes (Ionac 3470–Lanxess SAS, Courbevoie, France). The reference electrode (Mercury-mercurous sulfate – MSE) was positioned in the middle of the modified graphite felt (10mm diameter and 12mm width) and a potential of −1.65V/MSE was applied with a VersaSTAT 3 potentiostat from Ametek/Princeton Applied (Elancourt, France). The solution (10–100mgL−1 pesticide in 25mL of a 0.1M Na2SO4 aqueous solution) percolated the porous electrode at a flow rate of 1mLmin−1 monitored by a Gilson minipuls 3 peristaltic pump (Middleton, WI, USA). 2.4 Analytical procedures 2.4.1 Electrochemical measurements The electrochemical analysis was performed at room temperature under a dinitrogen atmosphere with a versaSTAT3 AMETEK Model (Princeton Applied Research) potentiostat/galvanostat. A glassy carbon electrode, a platinum plate auxiliary electrode, and a saturated calomel reference electrode were used in a standard three-electrode configuration. Cyclic voltammetry was carried out in acetonitrile with 0.1M Bu4NBF4 at 20mVs−1. The analysis of a modified graphite felt sample (∼1cm3) was performed by fixing it to a platinum wire. The error on volume concentrations is based on three reproducibility measurements. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and UPLC-MS/MS analysis conditions have been previously reported [55]. 2.4.2 Total Organic Carbon (TOC) measurements The solutions were filtered on Sartorius Stedim Minisart 0.40μm GF prefilters (Goettingen, Germany). TOC was measured by means of a TOC-VCPH/CPN Total Organic Analyzer Schimadzu. Organic carbon compounds were combusted and converted to CO2, which was detected and measured by a non-dispersive infrared detector (NDIR). Reproducible TOC values were always obtained with the use of the standard NPOC (Non-Purgeable Organic Carbon) method. For each sample, each measurement was triplicated. 2.4.3 Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) measurements Chemical Oxygen Demand was measured by means of a Test Nanocolor® CSB 160 and 300 from Macherey-Nagel (Düren, Germany). The amount of oxygen required for the oxidation of the organic and mineral matter at 148°C for 2h was quantified after oxidation with K2Cr2O7 at acidic pH and heating. 2.4.4 Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD5) measurements Biological Oxygen Demand measurement was carried by the test NANOCOLOR® BOD5. This test allows a simplified determination of the biological oxygen demand of a diluted sample. The oxygen-enriched sample is incubated in test tubes for 5days at 20±1°C in the dark. Determining the dissolved oxygen takes place after five days according to the method of Winkler EN25813-G21 by photometric evaluation of the iodine color. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Preparation of the modified electrode The graphite felt that was used as a support had the advantage to combine two interesting properties: a high specific surface area (0.7m2 g−1) allowing the immobilization of a high amount of catalyst in a small volume of felt and a good conductivity, facilitating its functionalization by electrochemical methods. The immobilization of the catalyst was achieved in two steps (Scheme 2 ). The first step consisted in the functionalization of the graphite felt by electrochemical reduction of 4-(carboxymethyl)benzenediazonium salt prepared in situ in acidic medium [62]. To check the efficiency of the multilayer electrografting method [63], the passivation of the graphite fibers modified with aryl diazonium salt was investigated by cyclic voltammetry with potassium ferricyanide as a redox probe. Fig. 1 shows a cyclic voltammogram of potassium ferricyanide before and after modification with 4-(carboxymethyl)benzenediazonium salt in a 0.5molL−1 phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 at a scan rate of 0.1Vs−1. After the modification of the surface with the aryl diazonium salt, the redox peaks of ferricyanide observed with fresh graphite felt disappeared. This blocking effect confirmed the presence of a molecular layer on the graphite fibers. Chemical attachment of the cobalt complex was then carried out by activation of the carboxylic acid with oxalyl chloride and then by reaction with an alcohol group of the complex. The grafted complex was analyzed by cyclic voltammetry in acetonitrile and compared with the same complex in solution (Fig. 2 ). The reversible system of CoIII/II was observed at a half-wave potential of 0.19V/SCE for the immobilized complex (Fig. 2b). This half-wave potential was similar to the same complex in solution, which exhibited a CoIII/II reversible system at 0.19V/SCE (Fig. 2a). The reversible CoII/I system obtained in solution at a half-wave potential of −0.99V/SCE (Fig. 2a) could not be investigated in acetonitrile with the immobilized Co complex due to the presence of an electrochemical signal in the cyclic voltammogram of the unmodified graphite felt in this potential region. Moreover, no electrochemical signal was observed when the Co complex was analyzed in aqueous medium. The volume concentration of the immobilized complex was roughly estimated (Eqs. (1) and (2)) by integration of the current-potential curve corresponding to the peak with the use of the Faraday law. Only the bottom of the wave (e.g. hatched area in Fig. 2b) was considered for the calculation of the volume concentration. Thus, the volume concentration of the immobilized complex was around 1.2±0.4×10−8 molcm−3. (1) Q=nF=S/v (2) τv =n/V with Q the electric charge (C), n the number of moles of immobilized catalyst (mol), F the Faraday constant 96485Cmol−1, S the surface area of the current-potential curve corresponding to the peak (AV), v the scan rate (Vs−1), V the electrode volume (cm−3) and τv the volume concentration (molcm−3). The volume concentration was close to the values reported before (0.6–1.8×10−8 molcm−3) for compounds immobilized according to a similar method [62,64,65]. 3.2 Exhaustive electrolysis The cathodic reduction of alachlor was carried out in a 0.1molL−1 Na2SO4 aqueous solution in the flow electrochemical cell with recycling of the solution (flow rate: 1mLmin−1). The concentration of alachlor was fixed to 1.8×10−4 molL−1 (50ppm) and the applied potential to −1.65V/MSE (i.e. −1.25V/SCE). A blank was first performed with a graphite felt only modified by electrochemical reduction of 4-(carboxymethyl)benzenediazonium salt (without the catalyst) as a working electrode. The concentration of alachlor was followed by HPLC (Fig. 3 ) and that of chloride ions by ion chromatography. Without catalyst, a slow degradation of alachlor (16% after 40min) and the formation of chloride ions (13%) were noticed, showing that the reduction of alachlor is not efficient at this potential in the absence of catalyst. UPLC/MS/MS analysis showed the formation of the dechlorinated form of alachlor (deschloroalachlor) during the reaction with a yield of 10%. The cathodic reduction of alachlor (50ppm; 1.8×10−4 molL−1) performed under the same conditions on a [Co(bpy(CH2OH)2)2]2+-modified electrode showed a rapid degradation of the substrate with a conversion yield of 95% after 40min (Fig. 4 and Table 1 ). The analysis of chloride ions by ion chromatography revealed a dechlorination of alachlor of 95%. This value is similar to the conversion estimated by the concentration of remaining alachlor and confirms the efficiency of the process. UPLC/MS/MS analysis showed the formation of deschloroalachlor during the reaction with a yield of 86%. This yield was similar to the same experiment performed with the catalyst in solution (85%) [55]. This result underlines the good selectivity of the electrocatalytic process, since deschloralachlor was the main product formed during the electrolysis. A current efficiency (Current efficiency=100×theoretical charge calculated from conversion estimated by ion chromatography/charge passed) of 25% was obtained that could probably be improved by an optimization of the cell. It is worthy to note that a current efficiency of only 9% was obtained for the blank (without catalyst). A turnover number of 356 was calculated from the chloride ions concentrations measured after electrolytic reduction of 50ppm of alachlor. This value is significantly higher than the turnover number obtained when the catalyst was in solution (4) [55], underlining the improved stability of the immobilized catalyst. Moreover, since the amount of catalyst used in supported catalysis was ∼192 times lower than in homogeneous catalysis (1.2×10−8 mol for supported catalysis, 2.3×10−6 mol for homogeneous catalysis), these results highlight the advantage of continuous flow catalysis, since a small amount of the substrate is in contact with the catalyst inside the felt, favoring higher conversion yields and lower reaction time. Indeed, the ratio of substrate to catalyst in heterogeneous catalysis was 375. However, since the catalyst is concentrated in the porous electrode, the reductive dechlorination only takes place in the volume of the solution inside the graphite felt sample (measured to be 0.9mL for a graphite felt of 10mm diameter and 12mm thickness). Under these conditions and considering only the amount of substrate in this volume (1.6×10−7 mol), the ratio of substrate to catalyst is 13 that is ∼3 times higher than the ratio (4) previously used in homogeneous catalysis. 3.3 Biodegradability Total organic carbon (TOC) measurements were carried out on alachlor solutions before and after electrolyses (Table 2 ). The obtained values did not vary after electrolyses, which is consistent with a selective dechlorination process. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) and the biological oxygen demand (BOD5) were also measured to check the biodegradability of the solutions. Indeed, the biodegradability of a compound can be estimated through the BOD5 on COD ratio and an effluent is considered as biodegradable for values beyond 0.4 [66,67]. As seen in Table 2, even if chlorine atoms are known to decrease the biodegradability of a molecule, the reductive dechlorination process was not sufficient to increase the biodegradability of alachlor. This result was confirmed by the BOD5 on COD ratio of deschloroalachlor (<0.02), which was the main product after electrolysis. However, these biodegradability measurements were only evaluated on 5days as in wastewater treatment plant with mainly household effluents and additional studies are needed to determine the effect of the dechlorination process on long-term biodegradation of chloroacetanilide herbicides. 4 Conclusions Finally, the covalent immobilization of the [Co(bpy(CH2OH)2)2]2+ complex on a 3D porous electrode allowed the achievement of a flow electrochemical process for selective dechlorination of chloroacetanilide herbicides, as demonstrated in this study with alachlor. Advantageously, this process only requires ions in the medium without addition of reactants since the reduction process is carried out electrochemically with a supported catalyst. As outlined in previous studies, the dechlorination reaction of this family of compounds is particularly important for long-term remediation of groundwater and surface water. Biodegradability measurements after 5days underlined the difficulty of combining directly this process to a biological treatment since the main by-product, deschloroalachlor, is not biodegradable under these conditions. A higher time scale, acclimated sludge or specific bacteria would be necessary for a total degradation of chloroacetanilide herbicides. Acknowledgment W.Y.

        "dc:description": "Chloroacetanilide herbicides are widely used pesticides in agriculture, resulting in contamination of ground and surface waters. Among the methods studied to enhance their degradation rate, reductive dechlorination is proposed. A [Co(bpy(CH2OH)2)2]2+ complex allowing electrocatalytic reduction of chloroacetanilide herbicides is covalently immobilized on a 3D porous electrode previously functionalized by electrografting methods. Bulk electrolyses performed on alachlor in a flow electrochemical cell show the high catalytic activity of the Co complex, leading to a total reduction of the substrate and a good selectivity toward the formation of the dechlorinated derivative. Interestingly, when it is immobilized, the catalyst is more stable than in solution as shown by the turnover number of more than 360 compared with a value of 4 in solution. Biodegradability on 5days did not show any improvement compared with the starting material, highlighting that even if chlorine atoms that are often responsible for the toxicity of a molecule are removed, the substrate can still have a biorecalcitrant behaviour. The main by-product, deschloroalachlor, was identified and was found to be not biodegradable accounting for this recalcitrance.",
