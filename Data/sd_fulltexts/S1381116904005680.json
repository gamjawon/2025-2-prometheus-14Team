A series of Mo/Nb2O5–TiO2 catalysts with Mo loadings ranging from 1 to 10wt.% were prepared and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), pulse oxygen chemisorption, laser Raman spectroscopy (LRS) and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR). XRD patterns indicate the presence of a crystalline MoO3 phase beyond 7wt.% Mo on Nb2O5–TiO2. Molybdena is found to be present in a highly dispersed state at lower Mo loadings. Pulse oxygen chemisorption results reveal that the oxygen uptake is found to increase with Mo loading up to 5wt.% and levels off at higher loadings. Temperature-programmed reductions of H2 suggest that reduction of the catalysts occurs in two stages. The reducibility of Mo/Nb2O5–TiO2 catalysts decreases with increase of Mo loading on the support. Laser Raman spectra shows that the surface molybdate species are present at low Mo loading (<5% Mo) and crystalline MoO3 bands are observed from 7wt.% of Mo and above loadings. The catalytic activity during ammoxidation of toluene increases with molybdena loading up to 5wt.%, which corresponds to monolayer coverage and remains unchanged at higher Mo loadings. A linear correlation is observed between catalytic activity and oxygen chemisorption sites. Graphical abstract The Nb2O5–TiO2 mixed oxide is an interesting support to investigate the dispersion of molybdena and catalytic properties. Molybdena supported on Nb–Ti catalysts are found to be highly active and selective for the vapour phase ammoxidation of toluene to benzonitrile. This paper provides information on the surface species determined by various characterization techniques like oxygen chemisorption, XRD, TPR and LRS. Keywords Mo/Nb2O5–TiO2 catalysts XRD TPR LRS Toluene ammoxidation 1 Introduction Supported molybdenum oxide catalysts are the subject of extensive investigation in the recent past because of their importance in many industrial reactions such as hydrodesulphurization (HDS), selective oxidation, ammoxidation and metathesis of olefins [1–15]. The development in the petroleum refining technology in the last three decades raised hydroprocessing reactions to a high level of economic importance. The catalytic properties of the active molybdenum oxide phase can be influenced by the nature of the support and the dispersion of the active component. Niobium oxides have been reported to increase the catalytic activity and selectivity remarkably with enhancement in catalyst life when a small amount of it was added to a known catalyst. Niobium oxide is known to exhibit a pronounced effect as a support for metal or metal oxide catalysts. The addition of Nb to V2O5/TiO2 was found to improve its low temperature activity [16–19]. A remarkable effect of Nb2O5 on Rh as catalyst support was reported regarding its activity and selectivity toward higher hydrocarbons in CO + H2 reaction [20]. The support effect is in the order of Nb2O5 > ZrO2 > Al2O3 > SiO2 > MgO. Titania and niobia supported molybdena and vanadia catalysts are reported to be highly active for oxidation/ammoxidation reactions [11,21–29]. The inherent favorable properties of titania and niobia supports can be explored fully by the combination of both supports in a mixed oxide. Okazaki and Okuyama [30] examined the catalytic performance of a group of binary metal oxides for NO reduction with ammonia. They found that Nb2O5–TiO2 binary oxide showed good catalytic activity when compared to other binary oxides. Our recent studies [31] also reveal that V2O5 supported on Nb2O5–TiO2 are active during the ammoxidation of toluene. Thus, the combined binary oxide Nb2O5–TiO2 has attracted much attention recently as a catalyst and as a support for various applications. Benzonitrile is used as a precursor for resins and coatings. It is also used as an additive in fuels and fibers. Stobbelaar [32] reported that MoO3/Al2O3 catalysts also have comparable activity with other vanadia supported catalysts in the ammoxidation of toluene. The basic problem in catalytic oxidation is the estimation of the number of active sites on the surface of oxide catalysts. Although this remains a challenge, considerable progress has been made for metals in the determination of the quantity of surface atoms of metals. Simple methods to titrate surface metal centers in oxides would greatly assist in understanding the effect of structure in oxidation reactions. In the present investigation we report the characterization of MoO3 supported on Nb2O5–TiO2 catalysts by powder X-ray diffraction, pulse oxygen chemisorption, temperature-programmed reduction of H2 and laser Raman spectroscopy. We also report the correlation between the dispersion of molybdenum oxide and the catalytic properties during the vapour phase ammoxidation of toluene. The purpose of this work is to estimate the dependence of dispersion of molybdenum oxide supported on Nb2O5–TiO2 as a function of Mo loading and also to identify the changes in structure of the molybdena phase with increased active phase loading. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation A series of MoO3/Nb2O5–TiO2 catalysts with Mo loadings ranging from 1 to 10wt.% of Mo was prepared by impregnation of the Nb2O5–TiO2 with ammonium heptamolybdate solution at pH 8. After impregnation, the catalysts were dried at 383K for 24h and subsequently calcined in air at 773K for 6h. The Nb2O5–TiO2 support (1:1wt.%) was prepared in the laboratory according to the procedure described elsewhere [30]. Briefly, the typical procedure involves coprecipitation of niobium (V) oxide hydrate and titanium isopropoxide and neutralization with 28% aqueous ammonia, followed by washing to neutral pH and drying at 383K for 24h. The resulting mixed hydroxide was calcined at 773K for 6h in air. 2.2 Catalyst characterization X-ray diffractograms were recorded on Siemens D-5000 diffractometer using graphite filtered Cu Kα radiation. Oxygen chemisorption was measured by dynamic method on AutoChem 2910 (Micromeritics, USA) instrument. Prior to adsorption measurements, 0.5g of the samples were reduced in a flow of hydrogen (50ml/min) at 623K for 2h and flushed in the pure He flow (99.999%, 50ml/min) for 1h at the same temperature. Oxygen uptakes were determined by injecting pulses of oxygen from a calibrated on-line sampling valve onto a He stream passing over the reduced samples at 623K. Adsorption was deemed to be complete after at least three successive peaks showed the same area. The specific surface areas of the catalysts were determined by the BET method using nitrogen physisorption at 77K taking 0.162nm2 as cross-sectional area of N2 molecule. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were carried out on the same AutoChem 2910 (Micromeritics) instrument, which is used for pulse oxygen chemisorption experiments. Prior to TPR the catalyst sample was pretreated by passing ultra high pure helium (50ml/min) at 673K for 2h. After pretreatment the sample was cooled to room temperature. The carrier gas (5% hydrogen–95% argon) purified through oxy-trap and molecular sieves was allowed to pass over the sample. Temperature was raised from ambient to 1273K at a heating rate of 5K/min and the data was recorded simultaneously. The hydrogen consumption values are calculated using GRAMS/32 software. More details concerning TPR are discussed elsewhere [22]. The Raman spectra were recorded with a LabRam spectrometer (DILOR) equipped with a confocal microscope (Olympus) and a He–Ne laser. The slit width was usually set to 200μm resulting together with the used 1800 grating in a spectral resolution of 2cm−1. The laser power of the He–Ne laser attached to the LabRam spectrometer was set at 0.14mW by neutral density filters. The ammoxidation of toluene to benzonitrile reaction was carried out in a fixed-bed down-flow, reactor with 20mm internal diameter made of Pyrex glass. An amount of 0.5g of the catalyst of 18–25 mesh size diluted with an equal amount of quartz grains of the same dimensions was charged into the reactor supported on a glass wool bed. In order to minimize the adverse thermal effects, the catalyst particles were diluted to its same volume with quartz grains of similar particle size. Prior to introducing the reactant toluene with a syringe pump (B-Braun perfusor, Germany) the catalyst was oxidized at 673K for 2h in air flow (40ml/min) and then the reactor was fed with toluene, ammonia and air in the molar ratio of 1:14:30. The zone above the catalyst bed was filled-up with quartz glass particles to serve as the preheater. It is heated up to 423K for adequate vaporization of liquid feed. The reaction products benzonitrile and benzene were analyzed by HP 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a Flame Ionization Detector (FID) using HP-5 capillary column. The carbon oxides were analyzed by HP-5973 GC-MS using a carbosieve column. 3 Results and discussion The X-ray diffraction patterns of calcined MoO3/Nb2O5–TiO2 catalysts are presented in Fig. 1 . In all the samples XRD peaks due to low temperature niobia were observed at d = 3.95, 3.14, 2.45, 1.97 and 1.66Å (corresponding 2θ values are 22.5°, 28.4°, 36.6°, 46° and 55.3°, respectively), in addition to anatase titania peaks at d = 3.52, 1.89, 2.37, and 1.48Å (corresponding 2θ values are 25.3°, 48.1°, 37.8° and 62.7°, respectively). At higher Mo loadings (from 7wt.% Mo) XRD peak due to crystalline MoO3 phase is noticed at d = 3.26Å in addition to the characteristic peaks of niobia and titania. The intensity of this peak increased with molybdena loading. XRD also indicates that no new compound is formed due to the interaction between MoO3 and TiO2 or Nb2O5. In the present investigation, the Mo/Nb2O5–TiO2 samples are calcined at 773K and XRD results (Fig. 1) suggest the formation of TT-phase of Nb2O5, which is in good agreement with the work of Ko and Weissman [33]. The present XRD results are in good agreement with our earlier studies on MoO3/TiO2 [21] and MoO3/ZrO2 [34] catalysts, wherein crystalline MoO3 appeared above monolayer coverage. The specific surface areas determined by nitrogen physisorption for all catalysts are presented in Table 1 . The specific surface area decreases as a function of molybdena content on niobia–titania, which might be due to blocking of the pores of the support by crystallites of molybdena as evidenced by XRD. The oxygen uptake values of various catalysts are presented in Table 1 and the other information such as oxygen atom site density, dispersion, etc., derived from it are also reported in Table 1. The oxygen atom site density, defined as the number of oxygen atoms chemisorbed per unit area of the reduced MoO3 surface, was found to increase with the increase of Mo loading. Fig. 2 shows the oxygen uptake of various Mo/Nb2O5–TiO2 catalysts measured at 623K as a function of molybdena content on Nb2O5–TiO2. At low Mo loadings the oxygen uptake approaches the straight line corresponding to a stoichiometry of one oxygen atom per molybdenum atom (Table 1). At high Mo loadings the oxygen uptake values are found to deviate from the straight line. The straight line corresponds to a 100% dispersion of the MoO3 with a stoichiometry of one oxygen atom per molybdenum atom (Fig. 2). The deviation from the straight line beyond 5wt.% Mo loading over Nb2O5–TiO2 support could be due to the formation of large crystallites of MoO3. This is in agreement with XRD pattern (Fig. 1). The theoretical monolayer capacity of MoO3 supported on Nb2O5–TiO2 has been calculated based on the method described by van Hengstum et al. [35] taking 0.16wt.% of MoO3 per m2 of support surface. Accordingly, the theoretical monolayer capacity of MoO3 supported on niobia–titania employed in the present study having a surface area of 55.4m2 g−1 corresponds to 8.8wt.% MoO3 or 5.86wt.% Mo. The XRD results of the present work also support the formation of monolayer and show the presence of MoO3 crystallites from 7wt.% Mo and above loadings. This is in good agreement with the theoretical monolayer based on the structure of MoO3. The TPR profile of pure MoO3 is reported elsewhere [34] with our work on MoO3/ZrO2 catalysts. The profile shows two major peaks at 1040 and 1270K and one minor reduction peak at 1070K. For TPR analysis of unsupported MoO3, the reduction conditions applied were similar to those applied for supported MoO3/Nb2O5–TiO2 catalysts. According to Thomas [36] and Arnoldy et al. [37], the reduction of molybdena takes place in two steps (1) Mo O 3 → Mo O 2 (2) Mo O 2 → Mo The sharp peak at 1040K corresponds to reduction of MoO3 (first step) and the second peak at 1270K is associated with the reduction of MoO2. A minor peak at the edge of the first major peak is observed at 1070K, which corresponds to Mo4O11 formed by the reduction of MoO3. Thomas et al. [36] also noticed this peak during TPR of MoO3 by in situ X-ray diffraction. Temperature-programmed reduction profiles of the Nb2O5–TiO2 supported molybdenum oxide catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 . The reduction temperature (T red) positions and hydrogen consumption values are given in Table 2 . TPR profiles of niobia–titania supported molybdena catalysts indicate that molybdena reduces in two stages. The first peak was observed in the temperature region 687–767K and the second peak was in the 1038–1070K region. The T red values for these two peaks increases with molybdena loading due to increase of particle size, which lowers the dispersion. Oxygen chemisorption results further support these findings. The low temperature peak is assigned to reduction of molybdenum oxide present in octahedral species and the high temperature peak is assigned to reduction of tetrahedral molybdenum oxide species. The increase in T red values indicates that the interaction of octahedral and tetrahedral molybdena species with the support increases with increase of Mo loading. The third peak in the region (1140–1160K) of TPR profiles is due to the reduction of Nb2O5 [22]. It is well known that niobium oxide is partially reducible when exposed to hydrogen at higher temperatures and the reduction is accelerated by the presence of supported zerovalent metals on its surface [38,39]. The reduction of pure Nb2O5 occurs at around 1273K. However, the reducibility of Nb2O5 becomes easier when it is associated with MoO3, and this can be seen from Fig. 3. It has been observed that the supported molybdenum oxide catalysts reduce at much lower temperature than bulk molybdenum oxide and the reducibility of molybdena is strongly influenced by the kind of support used. The advantage of addition of TiO2 to Nb2O5 is the enhanced the reducibility of molybdena catalysts, i.e. the reducibility of Mo/Nb–Ti catalysts is more than that of Mo/Nb catalysts [40]. Wachs et al. [41] examined supported MoO3 on different supports, including Nb2O5 by laser Raman spectroscopy under in situ and ambient conditions. In situ Raman bands for MoO terminal stretching modes are observed at 990cm−1 for the MoO3 supported on Nb2O5. Due to attaining of fairly constant MoO frequencies, Wachs et al. [41] concluded that the molecular surface metal oxide structures are independent of the specific oxide support. Jehng et al. [42] assigned the band at 960cm−1, observed in Raman spectra of 1–10wt.% MoO3/Nb2O5 catalysts under ambient conditions, to Mo8O26 4−. Kim et al. [43] also studied the Mo/TiO2 catalysts by laser Raman spectroscopy prepared by equilibrium adsorption method. They observed Raman bands in calcined samples species in the region of 949–958cm−1 due to polymolybdate species, Mo7O24 6− and/or Mo8O26 4−. In the present investigation we have studied the Raman spectra of Mo/Nb2O5–TiO2 samples under hydrated conditions as shown in Fig. 4 . The spectra exhibited a band at 951cm−1, which is shifted to 975cm−1 with the increase in Mo loading from 1 to 10wt.% Mo and was assigned to terminal MoO stretching mode of hepta- and octamolybdates. The bands due to crystalline MoO3 are observed from 7wt.% of Mo loading at 820cm−1. Hu et al. [44] also observed the crystalline MoO3 bands at 820cm−1 in Mo/Nb2O5 catalysts by laser Raman spectroscopy. According to theoretical monolayer coverage on Nb2O5–TiO2 support (surface area: 55.4m2 g−1) the MoO3 required to form monolayer is 8.8wt.% of MoO3 or 5.9wt.% of Mo are required on Nb2O5–TiO2 support. Raman bands due to MoO3 also appeared at 7wt.% Mo and above loadings, which is in good agreement with the theoretical calculations. The catalytic properties evaluated during the vapour phase ammoxidation of toluene for various MoO3/Nb2O5–TiO2 catalysts at 673K are shown in Fig. 5 . The conversion of toluene is found to increase with Mo loading up to 5wt.% and decreased at higher loadings. However, the selectivity towards benzonitrile formation did not change appreciably with molybdena loading. The activity of the pure Nb2O5–TiO2 support was found to be 2% and the activities of the supported catalysts were corrected for support contribution. The activity of Mo/Nb2O5–TiO2 was found to be more than that of the Mo/Nb2O5 catalysts [29] and comparable with Mo/TiO2 catalysts [21]. To find the relation between the ammoxidation activity and the dispersion of molybdena, a plot of turn over frequency (TOF, turn over frequency, which is defined as number of toluene molecules converted per second per Mo site) versus the surface molybdena content is shown in Fig. 6 . A linear dependence passing through origin was observed, which clearly demonstrates that toluene conversion is directly related to oxygen chemisorption. Oxygen is chemisorbed at low temperatures selectively on coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS), generated upon reduction, having a particular coordination environment. These sites are located on a highly dispersed molybdena phase, which is formed only at low molybdena loadings and remain as a patchy monolayer on the support surface. At higher Mo loadings, a second phase is formed on the already existing monolayer and this postmonolayer phase does not appreciably chemisorb oxygen. Our studies indicate that the catalytic functionality of the dispersed molybdena phase supported on Nb2O5–TiO2 responsible for the ammoxidation of toluene to benzonitrile is located on a patchy monolayer phase and this functionality can be titrated by oxygen chemisorption method. 4 Conclusions Titania modified Nb2O5 is found to be an interesting binary oxide support for molybdena. The activity of Mo/Nb2O5–TiO2 was found to more than the Mo/Nb2O5 catalysts and comparable with Mo/TiO2 catalysts. The results of pulse oxygen chemisorption suggest that the molybdena is highly dispersed at lower loadings on Nb2O5–TiO2 support. X-ray diffraction patterns also indicated that molybdena is in highly dispersed state at lower loadings and the reflections due to MoO3 can be seen only above 5wt.% of Mo loading. TPR results suggested that the reducibility of MoO3 decreases with increase of molybdena loading and the reduction of MoO3 became easier when supported on Nb2O5–TiO2 compared to unsupported MoO3. Laser Raman spectra showed the bands due to MoO3 at higher Mo loadings, which are further supported by XRD and pulse oxygen chemisorption results. The catalytic activity during ammoxidation of toluene is correlated with dispersion of molybdena.
