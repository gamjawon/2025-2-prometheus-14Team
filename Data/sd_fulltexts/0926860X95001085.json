These composite catalysts enabled the reaction combining methanol syn- thesis and methanol-to-gasoline reaction, and achieved the formation of ethylene and propene as the first example of the composite catalysts. The addition of alkaline metals, especially cesium, to Cu- Zn-chromate enhanced the selectivities of those alkenes. The influences of the reaction pressure and the space velocity on the production of alkenes show that alkanes are obtained by the hydrogenation of the corresponding alkenes. The composite catalysts producing alkenes in high selectivity afforded heavier hydrocarbons preferentially. These results indicate that the hydrogenation of alkenes inhibits the carbon homologation of alkenes to result in the predominant formation of the corresponding lighter alkanes. From these observations, it was found that methanol synthesis catalysts used for the composite catalysts are required to be effective for methanol synthesis at high temperature (over 300) and to bear the low activity of the hydrogenation of alkenes.

Fujiwara et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 130 (1995) 105-116 carbons are obtained by the Schulz-Flory-Anderson distribution law [2]. The combination of methanol synthesis and methanol-to-gasoline (MTG) reaction is an attractive alternative method for C2 + hydrocarbon production. There are two approaches in this system: the first one is the one-reactor reaction using a composite catalyst comprised of a methanol synthesis catalyst and a zeolite, and the second one is two series reactor reaction which contains different catalysts in the respective reactors. The latter presents a good system for hydrocarbon production [ 3,4]. On the other hand, the composite catalyst has a possibility that a large amount of hydrocarbons are produced beyond the thermodynamic limitation of methanol synthesis by the rapid conversion of methanol into hydrocarbons [5 ]. The first example of this type of the composite catalyst, Zn-Cr/ZSM-5, was reported by Chang et al. in the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide [6]. After this report, some interesting researches were performed using various composite cata- lysts [7-10]. These studies revealed that the reaction behavior of the composite catalyst system was different from that of the two series reactor system. In particular, light alkanes were obtained exclusively over the composite catalysts and only a small amount of heavier hydrocarbons (C5 + ) and no alkenes were formed, while the MTG reaction generally gives these hydrocarbons in good yields [ 11 ]. More- over, in the case of the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide, the yield of C2 + hydro- carbons was very poor [9,10]. We recently reported some composite catalysts comprised of Cu-Zn-Cr oxide and HY zeolite, which gave C2 + hydrocarbons in yields exceeding the equilibrium conversion of methanol synthesis under the con- ditions given [12,13]. However, even in the case of these effective composite catalysts, the hydrocarbons obtained were mainly light alkanes. Fujimoto et al. claimed that the side reaction of alkene hydrogenation by the methanol synthesis catalyst was an important factor in the reaction over the com- posite catalyst [ 14]. Our latest paper [ 13] also proposed a reaction path of the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide over the composite catalyst (Fig. 1 ). At the first step, carbon dioxide is hydrogenated to methanol over the methanol synthesis catalyst. Methanol thus formed is transported to the zeolite layer to be converted into ethylene via dimethyl ether. Ethylene in the zeolite layer produces C3 + hydro- carbons by the common carbon homologation of MTG reaction. However, ethylene or other alkenes, which are transported to the methanol synthesis catalyst layer, are hydrogenated to the corresponding alkanes, preventing the carbon homologation and, therefore, restraining the formation of heavier hydrocarbons. In this reaction path, the reaction behavior of alkenes, which is not observed in the two series reactor reaction, is the essential factor determining the distribution of hydrocarbons. Therefore, studies on the reaction manner of alkenes are indispensable to reveal the real reactions of the composite catalyst and to design novel active ones. However, failure to observe alkenes such as ethylene and propene [6--10,12-15] has pre- vented those studies under the practical reaction conditions. Cu-chromate (CuO.CuCr204) and Zn-chromate (ZnO-ZnCr204) are well known as Adkins catalysts [ 16]. These catalysts have copper or zinc species which M.

Our preliminary examinations showed their moderate activity for methanol synthesis in the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide. In this paper, we wish to describe the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide over Cu-Zn- chromate/HY composite catalysts. Using these composite catalysts, ethylene and propene were obtained for the first time. This property enabled the discussion concerning the influences of the reaction behavior of alkenes on the characteristics of the composite catalyst, especially on the distribution of hydrocarbons. Further- more, we would like to propose the desired properties of methanol synthesis catalyst employed in the composite catalyst for the syntheses of alkenes and heavier hydro- carbons. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation of catalysts Cu-Zn-chromate catalysts were prepared by the described method by Adkins as follows [16]. The aqueous solutions of Cu(NO3)2\" 3H20 and Zn(NO3)z-6H20 were poured into the aqueous solution of (NH4)2Cr207 and NH4OH. The resulting paste (the precursor of Cu-Zn-chromate) was dried at 80 for 12 h. Although these precursors were calcinated at 350 for Adkins catalyst, calcination was not carried out in our case. The alkaline metal-loaded Cu-Zn-chromate was prepared by the following method. The aqueous solution (7 ml) of an alkaline carbonate was impregnated onto the precursor of Cu-Zn-chromate. After 30 min, water was removed under 108 M. Fujiwara et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 130 (1995) 105-116 reduced pressure. The amount of a loaded alkaline metal to 1 g of Cu-Zn-chromate was 1.3 mmol. Calcination was not performed. The composite catalysts were obtained by physical mixing of precursors of chromate catalysts with equal amounts of HY zeolite. After being pressed into disks, they were crushed into granules (24 40 mesh). HY zeolite is the reference catalyst of the Catalysis Society of Japan; HY(JRC-Z-HY4.8; Si/A1 = 4.8) [ 13]. 2.2. Procedure of the catalytic reaction The hydrogenation of carbon dioxide was carried out using a pressurized flow- type fixed-bed reactor [ 13 ]. The reactor was made of a stainless-steel tube with an inner diameter of 9 mm. In a typical experiment, 1 g catalyst (24-40 mesh) was packed in the reactor, and was activated in a stream of diluted hydrogen ( 1% H2 in N2) at 400 for 12 h. After pre-reduction, a reaction gas (H2/CO2=3) was introduced into the reactor under 50 atm. The tubing from the catalyst bed to the gas chromatograph was heated at 100-150 so as to avoid any condensation of the products. After the reaction took place under the prescribed conditions for 1 h, the effluent gas was analyzed to check the catalytic activity by an on-line gas chromatograph using Porapak Q for carbon dioxide, MS-13X for methane and carbon monoxide, Porapak Q and Porapak R in series for methanol, dimethyl ether and C2+ hydrocarbons. The patterns of X-ray diffraction were obtained by using a Rigaku X-ray dif- fractometer with Cu Ka radiation. 3. Results 3.1. Catalytic activity of Cu-Zn-chromate/zeolite composite catalyst The composite catalysts made of various Cu-Zn-chromate and HY zeolite (Si/ A1 = 4.8) were applied for the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide. HY zeolite used in all composite catalysts was regarded as the most suitable one in our previous papers [ l 2,13 ]. Cu-Zn-chromate was mixed with the zeolite without calcination, because calcination drastically reduced their catalytic activity. As shown in Table 1, hydrocarbons were obtained over these novel composite catalysts (cata- lysts 1--6), although the predominant product was carbon monoxide. Cu-Zn-chro- mate/HY (catalyst 2) gave hydrocarbons in the best yield (5.2 C mol-%) of all composite catalysts of chromate. Table 2 shows the results of the reaction over the Cu-Zn-chromate (copper 1%) used in catalyst 2 as a methanol synthesis catalyst, and over the composite catalyst 2 at several temperatures. While methanol was obtained in maximum yield at 300 over Cu-Zn-chromate, the highest yield of hydrocarbons was observed at 400 over the composite catalyst 2. The low con- version of carbon dioxide and the poor yield of methanol below 300 over the M.

The distribution of hydrocarbons, where the selectivity of methane is low, indi- cates that C2 hydrocarbons are not obtained by the Fischer-Tropsch type reaction but by the combination of methanol synthesis and MTG reaction in these composite catalysts, because methane is generally formed as the major hydrocarbon in Fischer-Tropsch reaction [ 1,2]. It is noteworthy that ethylene and propene were obtained in the case of the composite catalysts of chromate (catalysts 1-6 in Table 1 ). These are the first examples of composite catalysts to produce ethylene and propene from carbon dioxide and hydrogen.

The addition of 1% of copper to Zn-chromate increased not only the yield of hydrocarbons, but also the selectivity of ethylene (catalyst 2). On the contrary, the further addition of copper decreased them (catalysts 3-5). 3.2. Relation between the alkene formation and the distribution of hydrocarbons In the reaction path shown in Fig. 1 [ 13], the hydrogenation of alkenes to the corresponding alkanes is an important factor determining the hydrocarbon synthe- sis. Comparing the results (Table 1 ) of Cu-Zn-chromate/HY (catalysts 1--6) with Cu-Zn-Cr oxide/HY (catalyst 7), the distribution of hydrocarbons was different. In the case of catalyst 7, the maximum selectivity of hydrocarbons was observed in propane. On the other hand, it is noteworthy that butane was formed in the highest yield of all hydrocarbons over the composite catalysts 1-6. In Fig. 2, the relation- ships between the concentration of C4 + hydrocarbons in all hydrocarbons and the selectivity of ethylene (Fig. 2A) or propene (Fig. 2B) are demonstrated using the results listed in Table 1 (catalysts 1-6). The concentration of C4+ hydrocar- bons increased with the selectivity of alkenes. The improvement of the concentra- tion of C4 hydrocarbons by the increase of the selectivity of propene was more noticeable than that by the selectivity of ethylene. Thus, it was found that the distribution of hydrocarbons was closely related to the alkene formation. Moreover, the composite catalyst which produces alkenes in higher selectivity is confirmed to be advantageous for the synthesis of heavier hydrocarbons. 3.3. Effect of the addition of alkaline metals to the Cu-Zn-chromate/HY composite catalyst It was reported that the addition of potassium to the iron catalyst enhanced the selectivity of light alkenes in the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide [ 18 ]. The effect of the addition of alkaline metals on hydrocarbon synthesis was examined over the Cu-Zn-chromate/HY composite catalyst (catalyst 2). Various alkaline metals were M.

In particular, the Cs-loaded composite catalyst (catalyst 11) affected the highly selective for- mation of those alkenes. Furthermore, the selectivity of Ca+ hydrocarbons was superior to all other composite catalysts. These results also support our explanation previously mentioned that the synthesis of heavier hydrocarbons is favorable over the composite catalyst producing ethylene and propene in higher selectivities. 30 ~ 20 O o_ 0 10 20 30 40 50 Reaction Pressure(atm) 100 80 ~. 60 O 40 ~ O 2o ~ 0 60 Fig. 3.

Effect of reaction pressure and space velocity The influence of the reaction pressure on the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide over the composite catalyst 2 is shown in Fig. 3. The conversion of carbon dioxide was scarcely changed by the reaction pressure probably because the reversed water- gas-shift reaction affording carbon monoxide as the most predominant product is not influenced by the reaction pressure. The yield of C2 hydrocarbons increased monotonously with pressure. It seems that the high reaction pressure enhances the yield of methanol, stimulating the MTG reaction [ 11,19]. On the other hand, the selectivities of ethylene and propene were reduced with the reaction pressure. Especially, the decrease of propene was remarkable, probably because the hydro- genation of alkenes was promoted. Fig. 4 demonstrates the effect of the space velocity on the formation of alkenes. The selectivities of ethylene and propene increased with the space velocity. These observations obviously indicate that alkenes are intermediates of the corresponding alkanes.

Fujiwara et aL /Applied Catalysis A: General 130 (1995) 105-116 113 passed through the catalytic layer without conversion into alkanes. The space velocity also influenced the distribution of hydrocarbons (Fig. 5). The ratio of C4 hydrocarbons was approximately 70% under the conditions (SV = 30 000 ml/ goat/h). Especially, the selectivity of C6+ hydrocarbons was considerably improved. It seems that the restraint of the hydrogenation of alkenes under the high space velocity conditions promoted the carbon homologation of alkenes to produce C6hydrocarbons in better yield. Thus, the formation of heavier hydrocarbons occurred preferentially under the conditions where alkenes were formed more selectively. 4. Discussion 4.1. Effect of the reaction behavior of alkenes It has been pointed out that the reaction over the composite catalysts is influenced by the reaction of the intermediary products of MTG reaction such as alkenes over methanol synthesis catalyst [ 13-15]. In particular, the hydrogenation of alkenes over the methanol synthesis catalyst seems to be a critical and undesirable side reaction, which is not observed in the reaction by the two series reactor system. On the other hand, in this study, ethylene and propene were obtained for the first time over the composite catalysts. The novel Cu-Zn-chromate composite catalysts per- mitted us to discuss the effects of alkenes on the reaction behavior of the composite catalyst under actual reaction conditions. The concept of the reaction path concerning the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide over the composite catalyst as shown in Fig. 1 can account for most of the results presented in this study. The main factor of the low productivity of alkenes is the hydrogenation of light alkenes over the methanol synthesis catalyst. The effects of the reaction pressure (Fig. 3) and the space velocity (Fig. 4) on the selectivities of alkenes clearly indicate that alkanes were formed from the corresponding alkenes. In the case of Cu-Zn-Cr oxide/HY composite catalyst 7, the ability of the hydrogenation of alkenes to produce alkanes exclusively is very high. On the other hand, it seems that chromate catalysts have comparatively low activity for the hydrogenation of alkenes, affording ethylene and propene. In the Cu-Zn-Cr oxide/HY (catalyst 7) used for the reaction, sharp peaks of metallic copper and broad peaks of zinc oxide were observed by XRD analysis. On the other hand, no clear peaks except HY zeolite were detected in Cu-Zn-chromate/ HY composite catalyst 2. This structure of Cu-Zn-Cr oxide seems to be more advantageous to hydrogenate alkenes than chromate catalysts, because metallic copper and zinc oxide are active for the hydrogenation of alkenes [20]. In the case of the Cu-Zn-chromate/HY composite catalysts, the addition of a small amount of copper promotes the hydrogen activation to enhance the activity of methanol syn- thesis. However, a further addition of copper results in raising the activity of the 114 M. Fujiwara et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 130 (1995) 105-116 hydrogenation of alkenes, reducing the yields of hydrocarbons and the selectivities of alkenes. An effective promotion by a small amount of copper was observed even in the Cu-Zn-Cr oxide/zeolite composite catalyst [ 13]. On the other hand, the composite catalyst (catalyst 5) with the same content of copper as catalyst 7, which gave no alkenes, also produced ethylene and propene. The chromate structure seems to be advantageous to the alkene formation. It is considered that the carbon homologation by the MTG reaction to heavier hydrocarbons and the hydrogenation of alkenes to alkanes occur competitively. Although alkenes are the intermediates of the MTG reaction, alkanes are final products that do not give other hydrocarbons under these conditions. In the case of the composite catalyst 7, the high activity of the hydrogenation of alkenes converts most alkenes into alkanes and suppresses the formation of heavier hydrocarbons. Therefore, propane was predominant. On the other hand, the ineffective hydrogen- ation of alkenes over the composite catalysts of chromate (catalysts 1-6) results in the preferential carbon homologation to form heavier hydrocarbons. This con- tributes to the maximum yields of butane (catalyst 1-6, 8-10) or pentane (catalyst 11). Under the higher space velocity conditions, alkenes are not readily converted into alkanes, but lead to the preferential formation of heavier hydrocarbons (Fig. 5). Thus, the reaction behavior of light alkenes mainly determines the dis- tribution of hydrocarbons in the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide over the com- posite catalysts. Although this effect has been assumed by pervious papers [ 13- 15], it was first recognized under the actual reaction conditions by using the composite catalysts of chromate which produce ethylene and propene. On the other hand, it is known that alkanes are produced from alkenes by the hydrogen transfer over zeolite even in the case of simple MTG reaction [ 11,21 ]. In general, ethylene is hydrogenated into ethane more easily than other alkenes over metallic catalysts. However, the selectivity of ethylene was the highest of all alkenes in every case. The selectivity of propene drastically decreased, and butene and other alkenes were scarcely detected. Therefore, a participation of the hydrogen transfer to the alkane formation could not be excluded at this stage. 4.2. Required properties of methanol synthesis catalyst for the composite catalyst to produce heavier hydrocarbons We would like to propose the required properties of methanol synthesis catalysts which are effective for the composite catalysts to produce heavier hydrocarbons. For the composite catalyst to be active for the syntheses of both alkenes and heavier hydrocarbons it is required to have two contradictory characters; that is, a high activity for the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide to methanol and a low activity for that of alkenes to alkanes. The metal catalysts seem to be unfavorable and oxide catalysts are desirable, because metal catalysts are generally active for the hydro- genation of alkenes. This assumption is also supported by the results that the M. Fujiwara et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 130 (1995) 105-116 115 addition of excess amounts of copper to Zn-chromate decreased both the selectivity of alkenes and the yield of heavier hydrocarbons (Table 1 ). In addition, the methanol synthesis catalyst used for the composite catalyst need not have a high catalytic activity for methanol synthesis below 300 where no MTG reaction generally works over zeolite. Moreover, as carbon monoxide formed by the reversed water-gas-shift reaction or the methanol decomposition was the major product at high temperature, catalysts bearing low activity for those reactions are favorable. Therefore, oxide catalysts with the effective activity for methanol synthesis at high temperature (over 300) and the low activity of the hydrogen- ation of alkenes should be advantageous to the composite catalysts producing heavier hydrocarbons. 5. Conclusions Ethylene and propene were first obtained by the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide over a Cu-Zn-chromate/HY composite catalyst. Heavier hydrocarbons were also formed more preferentially over these composite catalysts. The addition of alkaline metal, especially cesium, to Cu-Zn-chromate/HY enhanced this property. The hydrogenation of light alkenes as intermediates to heavier hydrocarbons is the most critical side reaction, and restricts the carbon homologation to heavier hydrocar- bons. This explanation was supported by the close relation between the selectivities of alkenes and the concentration of heavier hydrocarbons. In order to develop active composite catalysts for the syntheses of alkenes and heavier hydrocarbons, it is suggested that methanol synthesis catalysts with low activity for the hydrogenation of alkenes are vital.

The hydrogenation of carbon dioxide was studied using composite catalysts comprised of CuZn-chromate and HY zeolite. These composite catalysts enabled the reaction combining methanol synthesis and methanol-to-gasoline reaction, and achieved the formation of ethylene and propene as the first example of the composite catalysts. The addition of alkaline metals, especially cesium, to CuZn-chromate enhanced the selectivities of those alkenes. The influences of the reaction pressure and the space velocity on the production of alkenes show that alkanes are obtained by the hydrogenation of the corresponding alkenes. The composite catalysts producing alkenes in high selectivity afforded heavier hydrocarbons preferentially. These results indicate that the hydrogenation of alkenes inhibits the carbon homologation of alkenes to result in the predominant formation of the corresponding lighter alkanes. From these observations, it was found that methanol synthesis catalysts used for the composite catalysts are required to be effective for methanol synthesis at high temperature (over 300°C) and to bear the low activity of the hydrogenation of alkenes.
