Tel.: +86 10 89731586; fax: +86 10 89731586. Graphical abstract Al2O3 and SiO2 were used to load chromium oxides with incipient-wetness impregnation method. These supported chromia catalysts were evaluated for the dealkylation of C10+ heavy aromatics in hydrogen flow and were characterized with BET, XRD, UV–vis DRS and H2-TPR techniques. The results indicate that the catalytic activity of supported chromia catalysts on SiO2 is higher than that of on Al2O3. Structural characterization results show that surface reduced CrO x species are the active sites for hydrodealkylation of C10+ heavy aromatics. (C10+ heavy aromatics denote the aromatics whose carbon numbers are equal to or greater than 10.) The structural models of CrO x species on the Al2O3 or SiO2 support surface were also proposed. Keywords C10+ heavy aromatics Catalysts CrO x Hydrodealkylation Characterization Structural model 1 Introduction Aromatics are widely used as key and basic feedstocks of petrochemical industry. The demand for aromatics (mainly BTX, i.e. benzene, toluene and xylene) remains strong, and in this case, reforming and aromatization were widely used to meet the demand. Accompanying with the light aromatics, heavy aromatics with carbon numbers equal to or more than 10 are generated. They are rarely used and often burned off as fuels, which is a great waste of aromatic resources. Hydrodealkylation has attracted much more attention as a candidate method for heavy aromatics utilization. This method to get light aromatics is through the scission of subchain of alkyl aromatics in H2 atmosphere thermally or catalytically. Catalytic process takes place at lower temperature compared to the thermal one. Several catalytic processes have been developed since the method was put into practice and little change has been taken place on the arts and crafts. The major problem lies in the development of new types of catalysts. Some catalysts have been developed [1–15] for treating feedstocks containing C9 (or C7,C8) aromatics .The dealkylation performances on different catalysts were also studied [16–18] and most of them used model compounds. But the actual feeds are mixed aromatics compounds and they may have different performances in hydrodealkylation process. As far as we know, few papers in open literature converted hydrodealkylation catalysts for C10+ aromatics, and there is also no report on the correlating the molecular structure of supported chromia catalysts and their catalytic performances for the hydrodealkylation of heavy aromatics. In this study, several systems of supported chromia catalysts were prepared by incipient-wetness impregnation method. BET, XRD, UV–vis DRS and H2-TPR techniques were used to characterize their structures and physico-chemical properties. The fundamental insight into the molecular structure of the supported chromia catalysts and their reactivity/selectivity relationship was obtained. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The Catalyst samples were prepared by an incipient-wetness impregnation method with aqueous solutions of Cr(NO3)3·9H2O. The oxide supports were Al2O3 (provided by Shandong Aluminium Co. LTD, Analytical grade, pore volume 0.26ml/g and BET specific surface area is 179m2/g), SiO2 (provided by Qingdao Haiyang Chemical Co., Ltd & Spegial Silica Gel Factory, Macro-pored Micro-spherical Silica Gel, pore volume 0.94ml/g and BET specific surface area is 342m2/g). After the impregnation step, the samples were dried at room temperature for 2h and at 120°C overnight. Finally, the catalysts were calcined in air at 600°C for 4h. The Cr content is expressed as the density of Cr atom on surface of support i.e., Cr/nm2. 2.2 Catalyst characterization methods The BET specific surface areas of the studied samples were measured with linear parts of the BET plot of the N2 isotherms, using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 analyzer. Powder X-ray diffraction was performed on Shimadzu XRD 6000 diffraction-meter, operating at 40KV and 10mA, using Cu Kα (λ =1.54184Å) radiation combined with nickle filter. The diffraction data were recorded for 2θ values between 20° and 50° and the scanning rate was 8°min−1. Diffuse reflectance ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–vis DRS) of the catalysts were performed on a HITACHI U-4100 UV–vis NIR spectrophotometer. The spectra were collected from 200 to 800nm and referenced with carrier under ambient conditions. The TPR measurement was carried out in a micro-reactor containing ca. 0.2g of catalyst that was attached to GC analyzer. The catalysts were pretreated at 600°C for 1h in an air flow. Helium was used as the carrier gas. A 10% H2/He (v/v) mixture flowing at 40ml/min was used for reduction and the temperature was ramped at a rate of 10°C/min from 50 to 700°C. Hydrogen consumption was determined with a TCD. After H2-TPR, the reduced samples were mixed with carrier, and then the mixture were put into the DR-cell of the UV–vis spectrometer to get the DRS spectra. 2.3 Activity test The catalytic activity was tested in a continuous experimental system, which included a stainless steel reactor with 8mm inner diameter, an electrical furnace, a cooler, a gas–liquid separator, and a high pressure liquid pump. The catalysts with size ranging from 40 to 80mesh were put in the reactor. The reactor temperature was under automatic control. The hydrogen gas was supplied by a high pressure commercial cylinder. The catalytic performances of all the prepared catalysts for hydrodealkylation of C10+ heavy aromatics which were directly gotten from industry unit were investigated. The H2 used in the experiments was gotten from Jinggao gas corporation, and its purity is 99.99wt.%. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 BET surface area analysis The surface areas of the Al2O3- and SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts are listed in Table 1 . The specific surface area of CrO x /SiO2 catalyst slightly decreases with the increasing chromium loading as Cr contents is less than 1.17Cr/nm2, but the surface area decreases rapidly when it is greater than 1.17Cr/nm2. For CrO x /Al2O3 system, the surface area increases to 195m2/g when Cr/Al molar ratio is equal to 0.55Cr/nm2, it keeps almost constant for Cr contents from 4.41 to 7.17Cr/nm2. 3.2 XRD results The XRD patterns of CrO x /Al2O3 and CrO x /SiO2 are exhibited in Figs. 1 and 2 , respectively. From Fig. 1, when Cr contents are lower than 11.03Cr/nm2, no Cr2O3 characteristic diffraction peak was detected. As Cr content equals to 11.03Cr/nm2 very weak diffraction peaks of crystalline Cr2O3 are observed. These results suggest that the CrO x species on Al2O3 are well dispersed and exist in an amorphous state when the loading amount is less than 11.03Cr/nm2. From Fig. 2, when Cr content equals to 0.59Cr/nm2, very weak Cr2O3 characteristic diffraction peaks can be detected. If the Cr concentrations is below 0.59Cr/nm2, the XRD patterns are very similar to that of SiO2, indicating that the CrO x species exist in a dispersive or amorphous states. 3.3 TPR results 3.3.1 CrO x /Al2O3 Fig. 3 shows the TPR curves of CrO x /Al2O3 catalysts and the corresponding TPR results of the samples are listed in Table 2 . It can be seen that H2 consumption peak at about 377°C was detected for the sample with Cr content of 0.55Cr/nm2, which is ascribed to the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+. The T onset and T max of this reduction peak downshifts to the lower temperature with the increasing of Cr content. At the Cr contents of 2.76, 4.41 and 6.06Cr/nm2, there also appear reduction peaks at around 529°C, which may generate from the reduction of Cr6+ that has strong interaction with the carrier [19,20]. These two peaks may relate to the reduction of the two types of surface CrO x species near to the monolayer coverage. No reduction peak was detected as temperature was higher than 550°C. 3.3.2 CrO x /SiO2 Fig. 4 shows the TPR curves of CrO x /SiO2 catalysts and the corresponding results are listed in Table 3 . In the curve of Cr content of 0.15Cr/nm2, a weak H2 consumption peak presents at about 390°C, and its T onset is at about 371°C. With the Cr content increasing to 0.29mol%, the T onset and T max are at a constant value of 356 and 387°C, respectively, and the peak at around 400°C become wider. This may be due to the similar interaction between chromia and the carrier. The value of the H2 consumption area of the peaks corresponds to the Cr6+ amounts on the carrier. This may be the result from monolayer coverage. The weak consumption peak at about 550°C may be assigned to the reduction of Cr6+ ions, which has a stronger interaction with the support [19,20]. From CrO x /Al2O3 and CrO x /SiO2 systems, it can be found that at around monolayer coverage, the H2 consumptions have some special features, which may have the largest amount of the surface CrO x species. According to the TPR plots in Figs. 3 and 4, CrO x loaded on the two carriers all have two H2 consumption peaks. The first peak with reduction temperature less than 400°C may come from the reduction of CrO x species that have a weak interaction with the carrier. However, the second one is due to that of CrO x species that have strong interactions with the carrier. In general, H2-TPR results indicate that under the reaction conditions the CrO x species on the two carriers have been reduced, mainly existing as the three valence Cr [21], which was also confirmed by our UV–vis measurement results in the following sections. 3.4 UV–vis DRS results 3.4.1 CrO x /Al2O3 The UV–vis DRS spectra of CrO x /Al2O3 catalysts before and after TPR are presented in Fig. 5a and b, respectively. In Fig. 5a, the bands around 262 and 372nm for Cr content 0.16Cr/nm2, are assigned to the charge transfers of O2− →Cr6+ [23]. With Cr-loading increasing the absorbance edge red shifted when Cr-loading below 6.06Cr/nm2. The band around 224nm may result from the interaction between Cr and the support in all the spectra [24]. As the Cr content is over 1.65Cr/nm2, the absorbance intensity has little difference among all the samples, which indicates that the amount of surface Cr6+ species are almost the same. The absorbance band around 466nm is attributed to dichromate. And the bands from 550 to 800nm and centered at around 594nm is the absorbance of d–d electron transition of (pseudo)octahedral Cr3+ or Cr2O3 .For the samples with chromium loading below 0.55Cr/nm2, no Cr3+ was detected, while the intensity of the absorbance band from 550–800nm greatly increases with chromium loading increasing, suggesting the enhancement of Cr3+ content with chromium loading. In Fig. 5b, the absorbance bands that exist in Fig. 5a can also be observed, but their relative intensities are different from those before reduction. The intensity ratio of the bands centering at 600nm to the bands below 350nm greatly increases. This is due to the reduction of higher valence CrO x species. For the absorbance bands below 350nm, the absorbance intensity of the catalyst containing 0.16Cr/nm2 is the highest among the prepared catalysts. This is because that the lower Cr loading catalysts have more monochromate which are more difficult to be reduced compared to the higher Cr loading catalysts in which polychromium oxide are mainly present. Therefore, the catalysts with isolated chromium oxide structure are more difficult to be reduced than those with polymeric chromium oxide structure. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy has been widely used to investigate the structures and the oxidation states of metal-containing solid oxides that possess the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) transition of high valence in the region of 400–200nm and d–d transitions of low valence ions in the range of 600–800nm. For the chromium catalyst the bands of 200–333 and 530–800nm are the characteristic absorption bands for Cr6+ and Cr3+, respectively. Therefore, the ratio of the d–d electron transition band area of Cr3+(530–800nm) to the area of LMCT band of Cr6+ (200–330nm) was chosen as a parameter to relatively quantify the reduction extent of Cr6+ cations in this study [22]. The ratio of d–d transition band area of Cr3+ (530–800nm) to the band area of charge transfer of Cr6+ (200–333nm) of CrO x /Al2O3 before and after TPR was calculated [22] and listed in Table 4 . From Table 4, it can be found that some amounts of Cr3+ are present on the CrO x /Al2O3 samples even if before TPR. Moreover, Cr3+ content increases with chromium loading increasing. For the same sample, the ratio value after TPR are much greater than that before TPR indicating that a large amounts of Cr6+ were reduced to Cr3+ during TPR process. With the Cr content increasing the ratio value rapidly increase, which demonstrates that the isolated chromate is more difficult to be reduced than polymerized chromate oxide species. 3.4.2 CrO x /SiO2 Fig. 6a and b shows the UV–vis DRS spectra of CrO x /SiO2 catalysts before and after TPR. For Cr loading less than 0.03Cr/nm2, two intense bands are observed at ca. 270 and 370nm. These bands are generally assigned to O2− →Cr6+ charge transfer transition of monochromate species. The figure also shows a band at ca. 460nm, which is usually ascribed to Cr6+ in the chromate or the dichromate arrangement in contact with the support. For the sample with Cr content of 0.07Cr/nm2, a weak band at around 600nm is present, which is usually assigned to a d–d transition of Cr3+ ions in a strongly distorted octahedral crystal field. These Cr3+ ions are present in a cluster of chromium oxide which was not detected by XRD since the sample was amorphous. As the Cr content increases to 0.29Cr/nm2, the intensity of the three bands below 550nm continue to increase. When the Cr content reaches 0.59Cr/nm2, the band intensities at ca. 270, 370, 460nm decrease. The band intensity at about 600nm continues to increase as the Cr loading increase from 0.015 to 5.87Cr/nm2 indicating the increasing of Cr3+ content. The UV–vis DRS spectra of the CrO x /SiO2 catalysts after H2-TPR are presented in Fig. 6b. It can be seen that a band centered at ca. 250nm appeared and its intensity increases as the Cr loading decreases. This is because that the isolated CrO x is difficult to be reduced. The band area ratios of the band centered at around 600nm to the band from 200 to 278nm are much greater than those of samples before TPR with Cr loading more than 0.59Cr/nm2, as shown in Table 5 , demonstrating the reduction of Cr6+ →Cr3+. This ratio decreases after TPR which may be due to the reduction changes the environment of the supported chromia and causes the absorbance intensity decreasing in the bands 530–800nm. 3.5 Catalytic activity The catalytic activity and selectivity results of Al2O3 and SiO2-supported chromia catalysts for hydrodealkylation of C10+ heavy aromatics are listed in Tables 6 and 7 , respectively. From Table 6, the conversion of C10+ aromatics increases with the increasing of Cr loading when Cr loading is less than 2.76Cr/nm2. For Cr loading from 2.76 to 6.06Cr/nm2 the conversion keeps almost constant. But the C10+ conversion decreases gradually with the further increasing Cr loading. It is more likely that the surface CrO x species on the carrier are the active species. And Cr2O3 crystalline surface may have lower dealkylation activity, which may cause the increase of selectivity. When Cr loading is greater than 11.03Cr/nm2, the characteristic diffraction peaks of crystalline Cr2O3 can be observed in the XRD patterns, and Cr2O3 characteristic vibration absorbance band can also be found in the FT-IR spectra (not be shown here). Moreover, the absorbance intensity of ca. 600nm reach its maximum in UV–vis DRS spectra. The minimum size of crystal detected by XRD is about 4nm [25]. Al2O3 has intense IR vibration absorbances in the range of which the IR vibration absorbance position of Cr2O3 locates. Therefore, the vibration band of CrO x species on Al2O3 surface may be covered by those of Al2O3. Thus, it cannot confirm that at around 11.03Cr/nm2 loading is the monolayer coverage. According to Maymol et al. [26], 8mol% Cr is the monolayer coverage, at which the highest activity for hydrodealkylation of C10+ heavy aromatics in our study in the Al2O3 series was obtained. So it may guess that on Al2O3 surface when Cr loading exceed 4.41Cr/nm2 but less than 11.03Cr/nm2, Cr2O3 may exist in amorphous, two or more layers, but not in crystal form. From Table 7, for the catalysts whose Cr loadings are less than 0.59Cr/nm2, the C10+ conversion increases with the Cr-loading increasing, while the selectivity of C9-slightly decreases. If the Cr-loading exceeds 0.59Cr/nm2, the C10+ conversion and the selectivity of C9 become almost constant as the Cr content increasing. From the above characterization results it can draw a conclusion that the monolayer coverage is around 0.59Cr/nm2 over the SiO2 support, which is in good agreement with the literature [26]. And it can be easily characterized with UV–vis DRS and XRD. It can also be concluded that surface reduced CrO x species on carrier surface are the active species since the C10+ conversion increases with the increasing content of surface reduced CrO x species. Because SiO2 has high surface area, the increasing Cr loading may not cause much difference in the characteristics of surface species in some Cr loading range. 3.6 The correlation between the structures of supported chromia catalysts and their catalytic performances for C10+ aromatics hydrodealkylation Table 8 gives the C10+ conversion caused by unit Cr loading below monolayer coverage on SiO2 and Al2O3. It can be found that CrO x activity on the SiO2 is higher than that on Al2O3. This may be due to the strong interaction between the active species and the support, which promotes the activation of aromatic effectively. It is believed that on lower Cr loading the C10+ conversion normalized to molar Cr is higher than on higher Cr loading, except for the SiO2 carrier. One of the reasons is because that isolated CrO x species are difficult to be reduced, and the activity just comes from the reduced surface species. The other one is because that polychromium oxides are more active than the isolated ones. Also from the results in Tables 2 and 3, little difference was found in the C6 aromatics concentrations in products, but large difference was observed in the C9 aromatics concentrations. It indicates that alkyl with short chain or low subchain is difficult to be dealkylated and the CrO x species are less effective to activate the light aromatics. Based on the results in the present work, a structural model was proposed for the alumina- and silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts after calcination. This model is illustrated in Fig. 7 . At low chromium loading the grafted Cr6+ is the predominant species, which anchors to the support probably through –OH groups randomly distributed on the support surface existing in mono-, di- or poly-chromates. The surface coverage increases with the spreading of a Cr3+ oxide, which are stabilized by interaction with the support through –OH groups. For alumina support, further addition of chromium oxide until the loading amount exceeds the monolayer coverage, amorphous Cr3+ oxide is formed, and finally, Cr2O3 builds up over the underlying dispersed chromium species as the Cr loading further increasing. But for silica support, the CrO x species interact weakly with the support except for those anchored on the support more probably through –OH groups. They mainly exist in crystalline Cr2O3 state on support surface and do not form the amorphous Cr3+ oxides. 4 Conclusions (1) Different supports (i.e. SiO2, Al2O3) have large effects on the CrO x oxide surface structures of supported chromia catalysts. CrO x on the carrier surface may exist in different states, which relates to the carrier type. They may exist in anchored Cr6+, anchored Cr3+, amorphous or crystalline state. The anchored Cr is the best active site for C10+ hydrodealkylation. The monolayer coverage of CrO x are around 4.41 and 0.59Cr/nm2, on Al2O3, SiO2, respectively. (2) Surface CrO x is the active species for hydrodealkylation, so the activity is the best for the catalysts with monolayer coverage of CrO x . (3) Different carrier-supported chromia catalysts have large effects on the catalytic performances for the hydrodealkylation of C10+ aromatics. The conversions of C10+ aromatics over SiO2-supported chromia catalysts are higher than those over Al2O3-supported ones.

        "dc:description": "Al2O3 and SiO2 were used to load chromium oxides with incipient-wetness impregnation method. These supported chromia catalysts were evaluated for the dealkylation of C10+ heavy aromatics in hydrogen flow and were characterized with BET, XRD, UV–vis DRS and H2-TPR techniques. The results indicate that the catalytic activity of supported chromia catalysts on SiO2 is higher than that of on Al2O3. Structural characterization results show that surface reduced CrO x species are the active sites for hydrodealkylation of C10+ heavy aromatics. (C10+ heavy aromatics denote the aromatics whose carbon numbers are equal to or greater than 10.) The structural models of CrO x species on the Al2O3 or SiO2 support surface were also proposed.",
