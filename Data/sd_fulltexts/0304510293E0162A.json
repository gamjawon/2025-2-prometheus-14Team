Herrmann*, Richard W. Fischer, Monika U. Rauch and Wolfgang Scherer Anorganisch-chemisches Institut, Technische Universitat Munchen, LichtenOrgstrasse 4, W 85747 Garching (Germany) (Received April 5,1993; accepted April 9,1993 ) Abstract 243 Methyltrioaorhenium(VII) (MTO, la) and several congeners lb and 2a-d of formula RRe03 and R-ReOy'L, respectively, qualify as olefin epoxidation catalysts of high activity and selectivity. Related alkylrhenium (VI) complexes form efficient catalyst precursors as well, since they get oxidized by HZOZ to the same active species CH3Re0 (Oz) 2 H20 (3 ). The present paper presents a comparison of this novel class of catalysts with the performance of known, commonly used catalysts. Catalyst stability has been recorded and deactivation reactions are described. The synthesis and crystal structure (X-ray diffraction) of the (pale pink-coloured) monomeric aminofunctionalizedcomplea0gRe-CH2CH2CHN(C2Hb)2 (4A) and its (violet) polymeric form (4B) are reported. Only the latter is an active epoxidation catalyst with H202. An improved laboratory method of the standard catalyst MTO la is described. Key words: catalysis; olefins; oxidation; rhenium 1. Introduction Up to now, rhenium has not played any role in the oxidation of olefins, be it in stoichiometric or in catalytic reactions [ 1 ] . The few reports devoted to this topic unfold a remarkable failure of simple inorganic rhenium compounds to catalyze any specific type of oxidation [ 2a,b ] . This observation is all the more surprising as rhenium's neighbours in the periodic table - tungsten and osmium, respectively - form olefin oxidation catalysts of outstanding activity and selectivity: while tungsten oxide W03 behaves as an efficient epoxidation catalyst, osmium tetraoside 0604 is a well-known cis-hydroxylation catalyst *Corresponding author.

No straightforward explanation is available as yet to account for these fundamental mechanistic differences. The picture changed when reports appeared in the literature, according to which the structurally well-defined methyltriogorhenium (VII) (MTO, 1 a ) [6] represents a rhenium catalyst to selectively epogidize olefins at high catalytic turnovers at room temperature and even below [ 7 ] . A key patent has been granted to this finding [8]. In contrast to several metal-containing epogidation catalysts (e.g., [ O=V (OZ) 2 ] - ), no decomposition of H202 is effected by CH3Re03 (and the active species CH3ReO (02) 2 H20, 3) . The present paper is to compare the catalytic behavior of MTO and several congeners in olefin epogidation with related, commonly used catalysts. C H3 O,Reo 1a 2. Results and discussion For the sake of comparison, a short list of catalysts for olefin oxidation (eposidation and cis-hydroxylation) is given in Table 1 [ 9 ] . It can be seen from these data that MTO is one of the few oxidation catalysts that perform well enough around temperatures at and below ambient. Among the epoaidation catalysts, only Groves' manganese/porphyrin systems [9a,10] can successfully compete with MTO in terms of yields and turnover numbers (TON). cis-Hydroxylation mediated by osmium tetraogide is also an efficient, catalytic reaction. However, it is not a subject of comparison since Os04 is a singular case [4a,11 ] . A rhenium (V) porphyrin complex recently patented by Buchler et al. is to be mentioned (Table 1), albeit higher temperatures (typically 70 C ) are required; at the same time, lower product yields result [9b ] . Finally, Warwel et al. showed that dirhenium heptaoside Re207, a most simple compound, is a catalyst for olefin eposidation with subsequent ring-opening to give 1,2diols (trans-configuration) [ 2b ] . However, these reactions only work at high temperatures and high concentrations of the primary oxidant hydrogen peroxide, with typical conditions being 90 C, 60% H202, 16 h. Furthermore, only 1,4-diogane as a solvent seems to work [ 2b ] , and unwanted side reactions occur. A few other rhenium compounds [ 12 ] that catalyze the oxidation of olefins to trans-glycols are shown in Table 2. With the single exception of MTO, however, those are completely inactive at room temperature, even at reaction times of several days. Beyond that, all simple inorganic rhenium compounds (oxides, salts) and most other checked organorhenium compounds are not effective.

Using cyclohegene as a standard olefin, it can be seen from Fig. l that simple Re207 does not show any activity at 25 C in the presence of 10% hydrogen peroxide. At higher temperatures ( 70 C), some reasonable activity occurs, but only the subsequent ring-opening product trans- l,2-cyclohesanediol is formed under such conditions [ 2b ] . MTO in the presence of 2,2'bipyridine (molar ratio 1/6 ) exhibits both high activity and selectivity without any noticeable induction period; only the epoxide is formed at 25 C (Fig. 1) . MTO becomes even more active in the absence of pyridine bases. How- ever, acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide then can occur, depending on the specific epoxide in question. We suggest that perrhenic acid HRe04 from Re207-H202 is responsible in Warwel's system [ 2b ] for the observed extensive epoxide ring-opening. As we showed by check experiments, Re207 does not 248 WA. Herrmann et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 243-266 improve in terms of selectivity upon addition of pyridine or 2,2'-bipyridine as \"co-catalysts\"; by way of contrast, the activity is further reduced. The epoxidation mechanism of CH3ReO3/H202 has been established [ 13,14 ] . Albeit numerous organorhenium oxides [ 15 ] behave as homogeneous or - after grafting on polymers - heterogeneous catalysts for olefin epoxidation [8], we focus our present discussion on the parent compound methyltrioxorhenium(VII) (MTO, la). Further derivatives are listed in Scheme 1. MTO can be employed in epoxidation reactions within a broad range of temperatures, normally - 30 C to 100 C, typically 10-40 C [ 8 ] . As a pure compound, MTO decomposes even at 300 C in a sealed tube (normal pressure or vacuum) only very slowly [ 16,17 ] . In addition, the concentrations of catalyst and oxidant can be varied almost ad lib, which advantage also applies for the choice of solvent, with alcohols such as tert-butanol being studied best. Examples are listed in Table 3. We stress that MTO can be employed in high-scale laboratory reactions, cf. Table 3 [8,17] and Experimental. 2.2. Synthesis of the catalyst MTO Several procedures are available for the preparation of the catalyst MTO. We presently favour the combined synthesis. following eqns. (la) and (lb). The first part refers O a known procedure [6d,16]. The second step, (eqn. (lb) ) converts the catalytically as yet useless trimethylstannyl perrhenate of eqn. (la) into MTO by means of trichloroacetic anhydride. The product workup consists of (repeated) sublimation [6e,17o]. Total yields of 80-90%, based on total rhenium, are typical of this strategy. Fully deuterated CD3Re03, however, is preferentially made from Re207 and (n-C4H9)3Sn(CD3) (in acetonitrile at 80 C) for the reason that Sn (CD3) 4 is more expensive than rhenium and only 1/4 of the deuterium is utilized in this latter case.

Catalyst selectivity Sensitive olefins such as 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene and cyclo-1,4-hexadiene form their acid-sensitive epoxides with high selectivities at temperatures as low as - 30 C. The more electron-rich double bond is expectedly oxidized first. Thus, vinylcyclohexene is attacked at the eOcyclic double bond before the exocyclic vinylic double bond is subject of oxidation.

Herrmann et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 243-266 only occurs at the egocyclic olefin. It is not surprising that deactivated olefinic systems such as 1,4-dichloro-2-butene and mesityl oxide are oxidized at lower rates (Table 3). 2.4. EOxide ring-opening Hydrolytic ring-opening of the epoxides as the primary product is also catalyzed by the alkylrhenium oxides since la-H20 and 3 act as Bronated acids resulting from the strong Lewis acidity of the heptavalent rhenium in RRe03 [ 18 ] . In the contest of Table 4, it is noted that the reactive perogo complex 3 (oxygen transfer, cf. ref. 14) is much more Bronated acidic than the parent compound MTO [ 17 ] . MTO/H202 shows better selectivity for epoxide ring opening (= [ H+ ] -catalyzed hydrolysis) than aqueous hydrochloric acid. Furthermore, MTO/H202 has a higher activity than aqueous H[BF4] with regard to traps-glycol formation from epoxycyclohegane, as shown by the check experiments of Table 4. This corresponds to a catalytic effect originating from the metal center of the catalyst. It has been mentioned previously [ 7,13 ] that the reaction conditions for olefin oxidation largely depends on i) the reactivity of the olefin itself, and ii) the lability of the resulting epoxide for acid-catalyzed ring-opening to the 1,2diol. If cyclo-olefins are employed, then the traps-configuration is observed exclusively in the final 1,2-diol derivatives. For this reason, the acidity of the oxidation solutions must be kept as low as possible. To avoid this secondary reaction, nitrogen bases such as pyridine, 2,2'-bipyridine, quinuclidine, or quinine may be added to such solutions [ 7,8,13 ] . A recent patent claims secondary aryl alkyl alcohols to suppress eposide ring-opening during MTO/H202-catalyzed epoxidation reactions [ 19 ] .

CH3Re03 vs. Os04 251 We stress that isoelectronic compounds such as CH3Re03 and Os04 behave principally different with regard to their role in olefin oxidation. While CH3ReO3 quickly forms a structurally well-defined perogo complex [ 14 ] , OS04 has long been known to effect cis-hydroxylation of olefins via direct cycloaddition, with the primary oxidant not being engaged in this first step of the mechanism [ 4 ] . The factors governing these fundamental mechanistic differences are not clear as yet, cf. ref. 11, but should become evident from a study using rhenium oxides of general formula X-Re03, with X being substituents of differing (group) electronegativity. Such a study is in progress. 2.6. Base-functioOixed derivatives of MTO: synthesis and structural chemistry The beneficial nitrogen-base effect mentioned above stimulated the synthesis of MTO derivatives that contain a ( Q-basic ) nitrogen functionality attached to the alkyl group. We succeeded in making the y-aminoalkyl complex 4A according to eqn. ( 2 ) by treatment of Re207with the organozinc precursor Zn [CH2CHZCHZN (C2Hb )2 ] a in a solution of tetrahydrofuran (THF ). 2RezO7 +Zn[CHZCHZCHZN(CZHS)z]z 7\"~ 2 H C~CHz\\CHz z i p RB~N~C HzHS + Zn(thf)z(ReOd)z 2 5 (2) 4A The new organorhenium(VII) oxide 4A (yield 93%) is monomeric and contains a chelating y-diethylamino-n-propyl group. We suggest that a similar preparation starting from trichloro- or trifluoroacetyl-perrhenate 03Re-OC (=O ) CX3 [ 6e,20 ] will prove possible, too. 4A represents air- and water-stable pink-coloured crystals (from THF at - 30 C ) that melt at 95 C under decomposition (black residue). The crystal structure of 4A is shown in Figs. 2 and 3. In almost all known compounds of formula R-Re03-L (2), the donor ligand L is traps-oriented with respect to the alkyl group R (Fig. 4 ) . The geometry of these alkylrhenium ( VII ) oxides is best described as fairly ideal trigonal bipyramidal with approximate C3 symmetry. By way of contrast, the structure of 4A is not easily described in terms of a regular polyhedron due to the cis-orientation of the donor amino-functionality (Fig. 4). The coordination geometry is comparable with that of the aniline 1/1-adduct 2f-cis of MTO la [21 ]. In both cases, the structures are beat described as strongly distorted trigonal bipyramida ( Ce symmetry, see Fig. 4). Within this simplified view, the alkyl group (C1) and the two oxo groups (O1 and 02 ) take up the equatorial, 03 and the amino functionality (Nl ) the axial positions. Due to the envelope conformation of the five-membered ReC3N ring system, the entire molecule does not have any element of symmetry. If 252 WA. Herrmann et al. / J. Mol.

In this latter case, a water molecule is cis-oriented instead of the amino functionality of compounds 4A and 2f-cis, while the two perogo groups occupy the equatorial positions (replacing the two ogo groups of 4A and 2fcis, Fig. 4). Within the limits of the 3Q deviations, all three Re-O bond distances of 4A are identical, indicating no significant traps-influence to arise from the amino functionality. The Re-N1 bond distance recorded at a length of 238.3 (3 ) pm resembles those of the known traps-oriented quinuclidine 1/1-adducts of alkyl rhenium oxides (Table 5; d (Re-N) = 238.7 (7) - 243.2 (3) pm, for R= CH2CH3, CH2CH (CHs) 2, cyclopropyl, and CH2C (SiMe3) 3) . The Re-N bond of the traps-isomer of the aniline complex CH3Re03(NH2C6H5) (2ftrans) is somewhat longer (246.9 (4) pm) than in the cis-isomer. The rhenium-to-carbon bond length in 4A (213.6 (4) pm) is longer than those recorded for the quinuclidine adducts R-Re03-Quin 2b-e: (207 (1) 210.5(4) pm) and for the traps- and cis-isomer of CH3Re03-NH2C6H5 (209.5(5), 211.9(5) pm) [21]. The high structural analogy between 4A and the peroso complex 3 holds 254 WA. Herrmann et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 243-266 promise towards the implementation of chirality necessary for enantioselective oxidation by means of this new kind of structurally defined organometal oxide. Under slightly modified conditions, 4B is isolated in 90% yield in place of 4A. The two compounds have the same empirical formula C7H1gN03Re. 4B is not soluble in any commonly used organic solvent, just in contrast to the very soluble 4A (e.g., n-pentane, toluene, CH2C12, etc.). We thus propose 4B to have a polymeric constitution which assignment is not in conflict with the infrared data, cf. Experimental. Other connectivities (constitution) including a three-dimensional structure via the nitrogen donor functionalities in addition to oxygen bridging can not be ruled out at the present stage. rNU O~ I ,O O ~1 Oe yl l O o e~0 - Re ~N -ReaO N- Re \\_N-- o J o~ o J 4A 48 More importantly, 4B easily dissolves in aqueous hydrogen peroxide (tertbutanol as a solvent) to give a dark-yellow solution. As can be monitored by GC/MS spectroscopy, this compound is once again active and more selective in olefin epogidation than la, while its monomolecular isomer 4A, see above, neither reacts with H202 nor catalyzes olefin epogidation. Further work is in progress to exploit this strategy and to understand the structural prerequisites of perogo formation. rel.conc. 0.6I 0.4 h Os h a0 h CH3Re03 L' LCH3)3SiCH2-ReO~ CZHSRe03 C2HSRe03 I i t(h)6 Fig. 5.

Catal. 86 (1994) 243-266 255 2.7. Influence of alkyl groups One could have predicted that higher alkyl derivatives of MTO would not qualify in catalysis due to their lower thermal stability [ 15b,c ] . However, a comparative study has shown that, curiously enough, quite a few compounds R-Re03 become more stable upon treatment with hydrogen peroxide, even in the presence of water. Furthermore, the quinuclidine 1/1 adducts R-Re03-L (L = quinuclidine) can be employed in order to gain thermal stability [ 15b ] . Figure 5 summarizes the results obtained for the oxidation of cyclooctene by means of H202 at 13 C. It is noteworthy that the cyclopropyl derivative 2c is more active in epoxidation than MTO Quin 2a.

Re High activity and selectivity in olefin epoxidation is maintained as long as an alkyl group resides at rhenium (VII) . The dinuclear, thermally rather stable, easy-to-make Re' complexes 5a and 5b [ 6c,15i ] show nearly the same catalytic properties as MTO, cf. Fig. 6. While this behaviour is at first sight surprising, an explanation is seen in Scheme 2: the primary oxidant H202 converts the dinuclear precursor compound via oxidation to MTO, with concomitant elimination of mostly methane and ethane (molar ratio 1/5). These products are likely to be formed along radical pathways. Interestingly, further oxidation products, e.g. methanol, are not formed in significant amounts. The glycolate complexes 6 [22] and 7 [22] once again mirror the catalytic performance of MTO (Scheme 3, Fig. 6 ). Due to the clean Re' to Re' oxidation, no catalytic active sites are lost upon treatment of 5a,b and 6 with H202.

Catalyst deactivation 1H-NMR and UV/Vis experiments prove that deactivation of the catalyst MTO is not simply accounted for by hydrolysis of the active species according to eqn. 3 CH3Re0(02)2 -H20-+CH4 +H[Ple04]+O2 (3) to yield methane and perrhenic acid. (Dilute solutions of MTO in D20 decompose at room temperature very slowly and only incompletely to CH3D and perrhenic acid). Rather autoxidation of the catalyst with formation of methanol (NMR) constitutes the predominant decomposition pathway (eqn. 4). CH3 Re0 (02) 2 - H2 O-. CH3 OH + H [ Re04 ] + 1 /202 (4) No intermediate could be detected, as shown by UV/Vis kinetic experiments, cf. Fig. 7. Similarly, ETO (lb) forms ethanol as shown by NMR spectroscopy. The perrhenic acid has been detected by UV/Vis spectroscopy. If an excess of H202 is present in a solution of 1a in tent-butanol (catalysis conditions), then the lifetime of the active species 3 is much higher as compared to the lifetime of isolated 3 in the absence of H202. In contrast to the high stability of la in tert-butanol/exc. H202, both, the active system (la/ exc. H202) and of the bis (peroxo) complex 3 are more labile in water. In addition, the isolated active species 3 slowly decomposes upon dissolution in organic solvents (e.g., THF or diethyl ether). The monoperoxo complex CH3Re0(02)2 is first formed, followed by CH3Re03 (la). At the same time, 02 must be eliminated but was not detected due to low concentrations, cf. Table 6 and Fig. 8. It can be seen from Table 6 that both MTO and the active species 3 are more stable in tert-butanol than in water. While MTO is stable towards strong protic acids, quick decomposition occurs upon addition of [ OH ] -, with [ Re04 ] -and CH, being formed instantaneously [ 6a ] . Thus no catalytic activity is observed after addition of [ OH ] - to the system [ 13 ] .

WA. Herrmann et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 243-266 3. Conclusion and perspectives 259 MTO is a molecular, structurally well defined epoxidation catalyst of easy access, good stability, high activity and selectivity. Instantaneous reaction with hydrogen peroxide, due to the pronounced Lewis acidity of MTO, leads to a very reactive intermediate 3 [ 14 ] as the key oxygen transfer species. Higher alkyl congeners R-Re03 and R-Re03 L (L=nitrogen base ligand) also show good epoxidation performance and high selectivity, as long as the alkyl group R is not eliminated. Product selectivity - epoxide vs. 1,2-diol - can be influenced by addition of nitrogen ligands of the bipyridine and quinuclidine type, by introducing an amino group into the group R, or by pH adjustment. Epoxide ring-opening can thus be suppressed. MTO has opened a new class of epoxidation catalysts in that it now provides the chance of tuning reactivity by means of the ligands R. Chiral derivatives are known, and enantioselective oxidation could result eventually. 4. Experimental Dirhenium heptaoxide was synthesized by direct oxidation of rhenium grains on a 100 g scale by means of absolutely dry oxygen. For simplicity of preparation the apparatus of Fig. 9 was used. 100 g (0.54 mol) of rhenium were placed in an open ceramic crucible in hood via oil bubbler glass wool N S29132 heating oven male (500 C '1 1 dry 02 crucible-, Re NS29132 ~o 60 cm Schlenk tube lab bench Fig. 9. Apparatus used for the preparation of Re207. 260 WA. Herrmann et al. / J. Mot. Catat. 86 (1994) 243-266 the first third of a slightly inclined quartz tube of 3 cm diameter and 150 cm length (Fig. 9 ). The system was purged with dry N2 at 800 C for 1 h. After lowering the temperature to 500 C, the nitrogen flow was stopped. The oxidation of the rhenium was then started by changing the gas from N2 to 0, (Both gases were dried by passing first through molecular sieve 4 A and then through concentrated sulfuric acid.) A low oxygen flow was controlled with an oil bubbler at the end of the apparatus. Due to the high temperature, the ReA sublimes out of the reaction zone. The sublimed product was collected by means of along spatula into the adapted Schlenk flask (see Fig. 9). The reaction is finished after approx. 2.5 h. Yield: 126 g (97% ). Since MTO has become a commonly used catalyst in many laboratories, we present here an improved synthesis. Yields and simplicity of work-up are the advantages of the following procedure. The solvent THF (pro synthesi) was repeatedly distilled over Na/K alloy. Acetonitrile (pro analysi) was dried over P206 and then over KZCO3. 4.1. Methyltrioxorhenium(VII) (1 a) 1) A solution of Re207 (5 g, 10.3 mmol) and tetramethyltin (1.6 ml, 11.6 mmol) in 70 ml of dry THF was heated in a 250 ml Schlenk flask at 67 C (reflux) for 4 h. The solvent was subsequently removed in an oil-pump vacuum at 25 C. This step has to care that no MTO is distilled off with the solvent. The desired product was sublimed from the grey-white residue at 60-80 C/ 10-3 mmHg onto a cold finger (0 C) as colourless fine crystals. Isolated yield: 2.4 g (93% ). 2) The route described above yields stannylperrhenate (CH3)3SnORe03 as the by-product. It constitutes the sublimation residue and is recrystallized form acetonitrile (4.0 g, 94% ). This material can be utilized for the preparation of MTO as follows: A solution of (CH3)3SnORe03 (4 g, 9.7 mmol) and trichloroacetic anhydride (1.77 ml, 9.7 mmol) in 60 ml of dry acetonitrile was stirred at 25 C for 4 h. Tetramethyltin (1.5 ml, 10.8 mmol) was then added to the pale-green solution which was then stirred over night at 25 C. The solvent was then carefully removed in an oil-pump vacuum at 25 C. The crude product was consecutively sublimed at 90-100 C/10-3 mmHg on to a cold finger (0 C), thus resulting in dark-red crystals. The sublimed material was stirred over night in n-pentane. The then yellow solution containing the by-products was separated by filtration through a syringe. The white residue was washed with cold npentane (0 C) and was sublimed once again, as described above. This procedure was repeated twice to finally yield 2.00 g (83 %) of pure MTO 1 a. The total yield of MTO, based upon rhenium, amounts to 86% from the combined steps 1) and 2) . A scale-up of this procedure to synthesize 25 g (0.10 mol) of MTO in one run is possible by using appropriate sizes of Schlenk and sublimation flasks. W.A. Herrmann et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 243-266 261 The CD3 derivative CD3Re03 is synthesized from Re207 and (n-C4119)3SnCD3 in dry acetonitrile (80% yield). The details of this preparation will be described elsewhere [ 17 ] . 4.2. Activity tests of rhenium compounds related to Table 2 4.2.1. General procedure 0.2 mmol (calc. on Re) of the respective catalyst were dissolved in 5 ml of 1,4-diogane containing 10% H202. 10 mmol (1 ml) of pure, distilled cyclohegene were added. Unless otherwise noted, the reaction mixture was stirred for 16 h at 90 C. The yields of products were determined by GC/MS spectroscopy (HP 5890/HP 5970 B; fused-silica capillary column HP-1,12 m); cycloheptanone was used as an internal standard. 4.3. MTO-catalyzed oxidation of olefins related to Table 3 4.3.1. Oxidation solution tert-Butanol or THF (1 1) were kept at 25-30 C and mixed with 0.31 of perhydrol (or better 0.1 1 of 85% concentrated H202 in order to avoid high amounts of water). The solution was stirred with anhydrous MgS04 (250 g or 30 g), for 3 h and then filtered, c(H202) -3 mol 1-1. The concentration of the H202 can be varied almost ad lib but ranges normally between 5-25% (1.2-6 molar solutions). 4.3.2. Catalytic olefin oxidation MTO 1a (0.13-1.9 g, 0.5-7.6 mmol) was dissolved in the above oxidation solution (50 ml to 31, 0.15-9 mol of H202). The olefin to be oxidized (0.127.70 mol) was added to this yellow catalyst solution, which was either cooled by means of a cryostate ( - 25 to 10 C) or water (15 C) or was allowed to react at room temperature. In the latter case the reaction mixture can reach the boiling point of the solvents (65 and 80 C, respectively) due to the heat of reaction. For better control, the oxidations were monitored by GC/MS spectroscopy, see above. At the end of the reaction, which in most cases is indicated by decoloration of the solution, any remaining H202 was decomposed with a mixture of a catalytic amount of Mn02 and a stoichiometric amount of anhydrous MgS04 to remove the resulting water. The suspension was then filtered through a glass frit covered with Celite . The filtrate was than evaporated, the residue - either a liquid or a viscous or solid mass - was distilled or washed with, or recrystallized from common organic solvents (acetone, ethanol, etc.). 262 WA. Herrmann et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 243-266 4.4. High-scale oxidation of cis-cycOctene MTO la (1.9 g, 7.60 mmol) was dissolved in 1.5 1 of oxidation solution equal to 9 mol of H202 (c (H202) = 6 mol 1-1) . cis-cyclooctene (1 1, 7.68 mol ) was added dropwise to this yellow catalyst solution (molar ratio H202/ciscyclooctene/MTO=1184/1011/1). The reaction mixture was then stirred for 24 h at 15 C. After adding a catalytic amount of Mn02 and 200 g of anhydrous MgS04, the grey suspension was filtered through a glass frit coated with Celite . The solvent was removed from the colorless filtrate under vacuum (oil pump). The crude, colorless product showed a purity of 99% without any further purification (mp. 53-55 C). 4.5. Hydrolysis of epoxycyclohexane related to Table 4 Epoxycyclohegane (10 mmol) was dissolved in tert-butanol (8 ml). After adding MTO/H20, MTO/H202/H20, HClgq, or HBF4(Hq) (amounts noted in Table 4 ), the reaction mixtures were stirred at 25 C. Yields of the products were determined by GC/MS after 0.16, 0.5, 1, and 18 h (internal standard: cycloheptanone ). 4.6. Kinetics of the alkylrhenium oxide catalyzed oxidation of cis-cyclooctene 4.6.1. General procedure 0.12 mmol (calc. on Re) of the various catalysts (Fig. 5) were dissolved in 5 ml of oxidation solution (15 mmol H202) . To the chilled solution (13 C ), 1.5 ml (11.5 mmol) of cis-cyclooctene were added. The reaction was monitored by GC/MS spectroscopy (internal standard: cycloheptancne). 4.7. Synthesis of [3-(NN-diethylamino)-n propyl]trioxorhenium(VII) (4) 4.7.1. Isomer 4A A solution of bis [ 3- (NN-diethylamino) -n-propyl ] zinc (0.44 x,1.5 mmol ) [ 23 ] in 5 ml of THF was added at - 78 C dropwise to a solution of dirhenium heptoxide (1.5 g, 3.10 mmol) in 30 ml of THF. The mixture was stirred for 1 h at - 78 C and was subsequently warmed up to 0 C within an hour. To separate the formed zinc perrhenate Zn (THF) 2 [ Re04 ] 2, the mixture was cooled to - 20 C. The red-brownish solution was then concentrated to 5 ml and was further cooled to - 30 C to isolate analytically pure [ 3- (NN-diethylamino) n-propyl ] triogorhenium (VII) 4A as pale-pink crystals. 4A should be stored at -30 C under nitrogen.

UV/Vis spectroscopy The kinetic investigations were performed with an Hewlett-Packard 8542A instrument. Data for decomposition studies were obtained from freshly prepared solutions of MTO la (56 mg, 0.22 mmol) in 5 ml of tert-butanol (10% H202) and in 5 ml of H20 (10% H202) , respectively. To achieve convenient concentrations, 0.2 ml of the yellow-colored solutions were added to 2.8 ml of tert-butanol (or 2.8 ml of H20, Table 6) and were transferred into the spectrometer (l=1 cm, slit s=2 nm ). The calculation of the rate constants is based on the absorbance decrease at A,,.=364 nm. 4.9.

Alkylrhenium oxides as homogeneous epoxidation catalysts: Activity, selectivity, stability, deactivation Wolfgang A. Herrmann ∗ Richard W. Fischer Monika U. Rauch Wolfgang Scherer Anorganisch-chemisches Institut, Technische Universität München, Lichtenbergstrasse 4, W 85747 Garching Germany * Corresponding author. Methyltrioxorhenium(VII) (MTO, 1a) and several congeners 1b and 2a-d of formula RReO3 and RReO3·L, respectively, qualify as olefin epoxidation catalysts of high activity and selectivity. Related alkylrhenium (VI) complexes form efficient catalyst precursors as well, since they get oxidized by H2O2 to the same active species CH3ReO(O2)2·H2O (3). The present paper presents a comparison of this novel class of catalysts with the performance of known, commonly used catalysts. Catalyst stability has been recorded and deactivation reactions are described. The synthesis and crystal structure (X-ray diffraction) of the (pale pink-coloured) monomeric amino-functionalized complex O3 ReCH2CH2CH2N (C2H5)2 (4A and its (violet) polymeric form (4B) are reported. Only the latter is an active epoxidation catalyst with H2O2. An improved laboratory method of the standard catalyst MTO 1a is described.

        "dc:description": "Methyltrioxorhenium(VII) (MTO, 1a) and several congeners 1b and 2a-d of formula RReO3 and RReO3·L, respectively, qualify as olefin epoxidation catalysts of high activity and selectivity. Related alkylrhenium (VI) complexes form efficient catalyst precursors as well, since they get oxidized by H2O2 to the same active species CH3ReO(O2)2·H2O (3). The present paper presents a comparison of this novel class of catalysts with the performance of known, commonly used catalysts. Catalyst stability has been recorded and deactivation reactions are described. The synthesis and crystal structure (X-ray diffraction) of the (pale pink-coloured) monomeric amino-functionalized complex O3 ReCH2CH2CH2N (C2H5)2 (4A and its (violet) polymeric form (4B) are reported. Only the latter is an active epoxidation catalyst with H2O2. An improved laboratory method of the standard catalyst MTO 1a is described.",
