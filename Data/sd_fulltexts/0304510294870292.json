Popa, E. Segal',* Institute of Physical Chemistry of the Romanian Academy, Splaiul lndependenlei 202, Bucharest 77208, Romania Received 16 December 1992; accepted 31 May 1994 Abstract A new model for single-route, steady-state reactions on nonuniform catalytic surfaces is presented. Giving up some assumptions of the Temkin model and making use of a common mean-value theorem result in the introduction of the concept of kinetic insensitivity. The model rigorously accounts for the existence of a broad class of reactions the evolution of which is accurately described by \"classical kinetics\" (derived on ideal, uniform surfaces). The connections with structure sensitivity/insensitivity are examined in relation with the frequently invoked effect of surface restructuring. The application to two-step sequences leads to the classical Temkin model (as a particular case) and reveals some of its shortcomings, not yet reported. Keywords: Kinetic insensitivity; Non-uniformity; Single-route reactions; Steady-state kinetics; Surfaces 1. Introduction The concept of nonuniform catalytical surfaces, introduced by Temkin [ 1-3], is founded on the experimental evidence that the heat of adsorption varies with coverage and embodies two complementary explanations [ 4 ] of this fact: (i) the \"biographic\" nonuniformity, formerly called \"heterogeneity\", dating back to Taylor's theory of active centres [ 5 ] ; (ii) the \"induced\" nonuniformity, essentially due to adsorbate-adsorbate [6] and adsorbate-adsorbent [7] interactions. Whatever the microscopic reasons, a nonuniform catalytic surface could be pictured at a \"mesoscopic\" level as a collection of sites (active centres) with gradually * Corresponding author.

Sites with the same activity could be grouped in ensembles [8] with clear physical support (e.g., different crystal planes exposed), as in the \"homotactic patch\" model [ 9,10] , or have a random geometrical distribution. Although nonuniformity is generally accepted, at least in connection with industrial catalytic reactions, the single attempt to include it quantitatively in catalytic kinetics seems to be that of Temkin [ 1-3] . The Temkin model (TM) is restricted essentially to two-step catalytic sequences and involves some daring assumptions which make it convenient and extremely versatile. It was successfully applied to some important processes by the author [ 3 ] , Kiperman [ 11 ] and several members of the Russian school and largely discussed by Boudart [ 8,12] and more recently by Ichikawa [ 13,14 ] . From the kinetic point of view, reactions on nonuniform surfaces are expected to exhibit equations differing from the \"classical\" ones [ 4 ] , established on uniform surfaces and well-known as Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LHHW) rate laws [ 15 ] . This indeed happens as most kinetic data on \"real\" catalysts are described by power rate laws, extensively used in chemical engineering. The major success of the TM was just the prediction of such laws, e.g., for ammonia synthesis [6]. However, in many cases one can find a classical model (neglecting nonuniformity) yielding a kinetic equation with similar capabilities of fitting experimental data as the empirical power rate law. This was the source of an old controversy between Boudart [ 17,4] and Weller [ 18,19], the first defending classical kinetics, the second, the empirical one. In a more recent examination of this matter [4] Boudart appeals to the notion of structure sensitivity /insensitivity (SS/SI) introduced by himself [ 20 ] and closely related to nonuniformity. In general the reactions found to be sensitive to the modifications of the catalyst surface structure are governed by power rate laws, while SI ones (the turnover rate of which remains unaltered at such modifications) obey classical kinetics [ 4,8 ] . Clearly, structure changes result in nonuniformity (site-distribution) ones, so one should expect structure sensitivity to be a general phenomenon, whereas many experimental facts seem to show the contrary [ 21 ] . Some older explanations of the puzzling structure insensitivity quoted in [4] are: low site-multiplicity required for the rate-determining step, surface reconstruction, extractive chemisorption, formation of a catalytic metal-alkyl overlayer. An additional one advanced by the author [4] is that SI reactions are run at high coverages when biographic nonuniformity is masked and, moreover, classical rate equations are rigorously valid. However, Ichikawa [13,14] outlined the fact that SI is possible even at low coverages, his argument being related to the nonuniformity through the older formulation of the TM [ 1,2,11,12] and thus sharing the same shortcoming: the lack of an explicit site-distribution function accounting for nonuniformity (In fact a constant one is implicitly assumed thus involving an \"evenly nonuniform\" surface [ 3 ]) . V.T. Popa, E. Segal /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 94 (1994) 47-69 49 Several objections to Boudart's point of view were raised by Kiperman et al. [ 22 ] and carefully reviewed in Weller's recent contribution [ 23 ] . These include, in addition to the above-mentioned idea that SI reactions are not necessarily taking place on highly covered surfaces, the fact that they are not bound to classical kinetic descriptions. For a broad group of reactions, cited in [ 22 ] , most of them investigated by members of the Russian and Bulgarian schools, the best fit to experimental rate data is given by equations that are neither the LHHW nor the power law type. Moreover, the derivation of such equations is possible on basis of nonuniform surface activity. An alternative approach invoked in Boudart's response [24] is due to Corma et al. [ 25 ] which tested 12 rate equations (derived for Langmuir, Temkin and Freundlich adsorption) on 19 reported studies for which detailed kinetic data were available. However this procedure is restricted to catalytic kinetics with (quasi) equilibrated adsorption [26], a particular case which neither most heterogeneously catalysed reactions nor the Temkin model itself are not confined to. A likely microscopic argument seems to be Somorjai's concept of \"flexible surface\" [ 27,28 ] : experimental evidence of surface restructuring through adsorbate-adsorbent interactions on chemisorption time scale (10-6 s) are thought to be the result of an \"induced uniformity\" of the initial biographically nonuniform surface and thus of SI reactions. This picture is clearly the opposite of the older one of induced nonuniformity. Moreover, it affects one of the basic TM assumptions: the analogy between the adsorption equilibrium and the steady-state reaction on a certain catalytic surface. This means that a catalyst exhibiting strong nonuniformity at the adsorption equilibrium of a reactant should behave similarly while performing some reaction of the same substance (This led Temkin to the use of only two types of site distributions, i.e., the constant and exponential ones related to the Temkin and Freundlich empirical isotherms, respectively). In contrast, in Somorjai's view surface restructuring caused by strong chemisorption of reactants could erase (just as some other phenomena quoted in [4] ) the biographic~nonuniformity while creating the (initially absent) active sites for the reaction. It seems that describing reactive nonuniformity in terms of site distributions derived from adsorption equilibria is not generally valid. Removing this constraint and some other assumptions of the TM enables the construction of a new, more general model revealing the connections between surface nonuniformity, structure sensitivity and kinetics for the rather broad class of multi-step, single-route reactions. This new model reduces to the TM as a particular case for two-step mechanisms while revealing some inconsistencies, not yet reported, of the classical Temkin approach. 2. General model for single-route reactions on nonuniform surfaces The model appeals to some important results of the theory of complex reactions [3,29,30] which will be briefly resumed. 50 V T Popa, E.

The elimination of these is possible in principle, by means of the steady-state conditions and the balance equations of the type: J E [Xi] -1 (g> i=1 V T Popa, E. Segal /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 94 (1994) 47-69 51 As in heterogeneous catalysis the active centres are usually free or covered surface atoms. Eq. 8 reflects the common procedure of normalizing their concentrations so that [X;] represent fractional coverages. For linear sequences (comprising only non-dissociative adsorption and EleyRideal reaction steps) the elimination of [X;] results in a single solution [3,31]. In the presence of nonlinear steps (such as dissociative adsorption or LangmuirHinshelwood surface reactions) the elimination, although most tedious, is still possible leading to one equation with one unknown (usually the reaction rate) called the kinetic polynomial. Investigation of this yields the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of multiple solutions, i.e., for the appearance of steady-state multiplicity [ 32,33 ] . Even in very simple nonlinear sequences, obtaining analytical rate equations is tiresome and one has to resort to numerical methods. An interesting test of such methods against derived analytical solutions was performed by Salmi [ 34] . In what follows we have assumed a definite analytical expression of the reaction rate corresponding to the mechanism (Eq. 1) or to some of its simplified versions. This is the case with most kinetic analyses of experimental data in which, using approximations [ 8 ] such as rate determining step (rds) and most abundant reaction intermediate (mari), schemes like (Eq. 1) are reduced to fewer steps (most frequently two) with kinetic significance, resulting in much simpler rate equations. Let vL (subscript L stands for \"local\") be such a rate expression containing only the rate constants and the concentrations of stable species [A;] vL =uL( [A;], kti) i=1, ..., M j=1, ..., S (9) Further, taking into account a common result of the transition state theory (TST) [35] ktJ =X,(kBT/h)exp(-dG tllRT) -kj* exp(xtj) j=1, ..., S (10) where 4G +j and 4G'-j, are Gibbs free energies of activation for the forward and backward elementary reactions of the step j, V; is the transmission coefficient assumed equal for k+j and k_j [36] and k+j=k _j=XjkBTlh xtj=-dGtllRT Eq. 9 becomes: VL=UL([Atl,4Gt;)=F([A;l,xti) j=1,...,S i=1,...,M (11) On the other hand, the standard Gibbs free energy of the overall reaction, aG , 4G = -RT In K (12) is related to the contributions, 4Gj, of the mechanistic steps, 4Gj' --RT1nKj j=1, ,S (13) 52 V T.

If the rate constants, k, ,j, are allowed to change continuously, Eqs. 9 or 11 represent turnover rates on a set of uniform surfaces with varying activity. If this happens on a real catalyst, we are speaking of its nonuniform behaviour manifested in variable local turnover rate (LTR), vL. At this point, the following assumptions are necessary: 1. The steady reaction taking place on a nonuniform surface proceeds through the same sequence of mechanistic steps (Eq. 1) on all sites, i.e., the local mechanism is valid on the whole surface with a single expression of the turnover rate. Obviously, this means that only single-route reactions are taken into consideration. 2. From the thermodynamical point of view, nonuniformity is manifested through the perturbation of local equilibrium. On different zones of the surface there is a variation of the individual (step) equilibrium constants, Kj, submitted to the restric tion (Eq. 6), ensuring the non-perturbation of the overall equilibrium. Kinetically, this entails the variation of 2S rate constants, k: ,j, submitted to the same restriction (Eq. 6). Temkin's approach links the kinetic and thermodynamic aspects of the nonuniformity with the linear relationships of Polanyi [ 1,2,11-14] or Bronsted [ 3,8 ] , mainly because of the considerable gain in mathematical convenience. How ever, within the scope of the present and subsequent section this additional assump tion is not necessary. Taking xt j as nonuniformity variables the local rate is represented by a continuous function, F([A;], x,,-j), defined on the open subset, ,flF (given by (15) ) of the real 2S-dimensional space, RZs. Obviously, F is positive, i.e., it takes values in R+. The specific expression of the LTR contains the values of the concentrations, [A;] , the experimental observables; they are constant within a single steady state run and can be treated as parameters of the mechanistic function, F. The convenient notation UL =F([Ai], xtj) -F([A], x) x= (xt) ; [A] = ( [Ar]) (17) where (xt), l= -S, ..., -1, 1, ..., S is the nonuniformity variables' vector and ( [A;] ), i =1, ..., M is the concentrations' vector, concludes the mathematical VT Popa, E. Segal /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 94 (1994) 47-69 53 picture of the local mechanism. In general, any catalyst will exhibit a more limited span of local activity than the one given by Eq. 15 so that the variables x, will be confined to a closed set, nG C f2F. The catalyst specificity is embodied in its distribution function, for which the third assumption is needed: 3. The surface active sites are distributed with respect to the variables x with a density function, G, so that G(x)dx=G(x_S, ..., xs)dx_S...dx,, (18) representing the fraction of the total number of sites with values of the nonuniformity variables within x and x+dx, is an integrable function on 12G. Evidently, the function G is normalized f G(x)dx=1 (19) nG where the integral sign stands for a 2S-multiple integral. Now the overall turnover rate (OTR), V, being the weighted sum of all local contributions for a nonuniform catalyst, simply reads V=V([A]) = f F([A], x)G(x)dx (20) rlc Eq. 20 implicitly embodies a supplementary assumption needing careful outlining: 4. The distribution, G, is supported to remain unchanged within the experimental range for which the local mechanism holds. This seems almost trivial in TM terms but, recalling the already invoked [27,28] phenomena of \"surface motility\", instances where the above statement are not valid are perfectly conceivable. Clearly, trying to use Eq. 20 for analytical applications, even in the simple case of two-step reactions, is most inconvenient. Fortunately, a classical theorem of mathematical analysis affords some interesting and general results, with no need for specific analytical expressions. 3. Mean-value theorem and kinetic insensitivity The two functions of Eq. 20 fulfil the requirements of the common \"mean-value theorem (MVT) for multiple integrals\" [37]. F is continuous on ,(2F, thus on nG c ,nF and G is integrable on ,(2a. If nG is a connected set, there is at least one point, X E nG for which the following equality holds: f F(x)G(x)dx=F(x-) f G(x)dx xEna (21) rk Thus taking into account Eq. 19, the overall rate is given by 54 V. T. Papa, E. Segal /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 94 (1994) 47-69 V=F([A], x-) (22) If ,(2G is not connected, one can always find a closed set, ,(2F, with ,flFDnF:)d2G for which Eq. 21 holds, with xE f 2F. Returning to the kinetic notations, Eq. 22 becomes V=F([Ai], xtJ) -UL([Ai], ktj) - L i=1, ..., M; j=1, ..., S (23) so that the OTR equals the LTR with the kinetic constants taking some fixed values within their ranges. Even if the distribution is bi or multi-modal (in which case the set nG could be not connected) these values certainly correspond to a point in f2F, i.e., they obey the fundamental mechanistic requirement Eq. 6 (or Eq. 15): s s K= I-I (k+j/k_j)'1 x= oj(x+j-x_j) (24) i=i i=i This means that the steady-state reaction taking place on a nonuniform surface can be rigorously described through the rate equation corresponding to its local mechanism and thus it obeys classical kinetics. This happens if the assumptions of the preceding section are valid for the reaction in question. It appears that Boudart [4] was right in defining classical kinetics, as their validity is mathematically proved for quite a broad class of catalytic reactions, amenable to the presented model. The fact that a chemical process running on a nonuniform catalyst exhibits uniform-like rate equations, i.e., it strictly obeys classical kinetics, could be adequately termed kinetic insensitivity. Consequently, Eq. 23 supports a common procedure in catalytic studies: although real catalysts are nonuniform, experimental data are fitted by classical rate equations, as if nonuniformity was absent. We emphasise that the model assumes a true nonuniform catalytic surface and includes the case of \"erasing\" (uniformization) as a particular one. Indeed, Eq. 23 is not confined to SI reactions for which the validity of classical kinetics was claimed [4]. Thus kinetic insensitivity allows for structure sensitivity. As far as direct experimental evidence on the distribution function is not (yet) available, any discussion on this matter is most speculative, but noteworthy. Let the same reaction (local mechanism) take place on two samples of a metalsupported catalyst with different dispersions [ 8 ] ; the absence of any erasing effects results in two different site-distributions and MVT yields Vi = J F(x)Gi(x)&=F([A], x'); VZ = j F(x)G2(x)d'=F([A], x2) DG I .fG, (25) with x' E nF:)nG, and x2 E nF::)nG2. As a rule V, 0 V2 so that the reaction is structure sensitive in spite of its kinetic insensitivity! If the two distributions G1 and G2 are extremely different one can expect large differences between the cor- V T Popa, E. Segal /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 94 (1994) 47-69 55 responding overall rates. However this depends also on the function F and on the two sets .f2G, and nG2. Thus, on the other extreme, if the two sets are practically identical while the two distributions are different and if in this range the variation of F is sufficiently slow, we can have V, = VZ! We came to the idea that structure insensitivity is conceivable even without an erasing process, that is with a regular nonuniform behaviour of the catalytic surface. Generally speaking, a \"flat\" local mechanism yields SI (unless the differences in the distributions are too large), whereas a \"steep\" one yields SS (even if the distributions are quite alike). Consider now the above mentioned concept of a \"flexible surface\" [ 27,28 ] . Surface restructuring taking place at the chemisorption time scale on two different samples could lead to biographical nonuniformity erasing: in terms of Eq. 25 this means that the functions G, and GZ approach the 2S-dimensional Dirac distribution G, (x) - 8(x-y') Gz(x) -> 8(x-y2) (26) and Eq. 25 gives simply Vi =F(y'); Vz =F(y2) (27) Until there is direct experimental confirmation, we think there is no \"a priori\" reason for the two 8-distributions to be centred at the same point. This could, or could not happen. In other words, two most different biographically nonuniform surfaces which undergo an erasing restructuring process in the same reaction conditions are not necessarily transformed into identical uniform surfaces. If this assertion is true, then y 1 O y 2 could result in V, 0 VZ so that one may speak of structure sensitivity within a strictly uniform behaviour of the catalytic surface. This really happens for SS reactions on single crystals, the exposed planes of which are expected to be uniform. One can see that in all the above cases the term \"kinetic insensitivity\" preserves its full meaning, considering the uniform surface as a limiting case of the nonuniform one. At this point, one is naturally driven to find out what happens when classical kinetics fails and power laws or other types of rate equations [22] are better in data fitting. Firstly, in some thoroughly investigated cases [ 8 ] , classical and power rate equations have been shown to be equivalent within certain experimental ranges. Thus, even with a strictly uniform surface, for certain mechanisms one can find a power law having nothing to do with the nonuniformity. (Obviously, this is simply the reverse of the argument cited in the first section). Secondly, one may invoke mechanistic multiplicity which is in fact characteristic to industrial catalytic processes. Here, power rate laws are the simplest means of describing an experiment which involves both multi-route and nonuniformity complications. However, this is beyond the scope of the present paper. Finally, in the case of single-route reactions we are dealing with, it remains the problem of assumption 4. of the preceding section. Suppose that, due restructuring processes taking place at the turnover time scale [ 27,28 ] , the distribution function 56 V T. Popa, E. Segal /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 94 (1994) 47-69 changes with the experimental conditions (composition, temperature). If the MVT still holds, it becomes now v=F'([A], x([A] , T)) (22') with the value of the nonuniformity variables' vector depending now on [Aj and T. The overall rate thus exhibits a more complicated concentration dependence expressible (or not) through a power law as an approximation [ 22 ] . However, if the composition and temperature ranges investigated are not too large, Eq. 22 may be taken as an approximation of Eq. 22', at least within the experimental errors. If so, the same holds for all the above-discussed consequences of Eq. 22. If not, the presented model (in its most remote version from the original Temkin one) yields a power (or more complicated) rate equation, with no classical counterpart possible. It will be shown in the next section that prediction of power laws within the TM is merely due to its intrinsic simplifying assumptions and to the specific form of the site-distribution, the main feature of the nonuniformity. 4. Two-step mechanisms 4.1. TM as a particular case of the multi-step model The general model presented here reduces to the TM under the specific conditions of Temkin's approach. For a linear two-step sequence, Eqs. 1 and 2 become: k+t (Eq. 1) A, +X1 ~ A3 +X2 k+z k (l') (Eq. 2) A2 +X2 ~ k-2 A4 +X1 4 2 vt -A,t -1, M=4, J=2, S=2 Vii + .t;~ -2 J=1, 2 t=~ t=1 (2') The overall stoichiometric equation, with o-1= o-2 =1, reads A, +A2 =A3 +A4 (5') whereas the thermodynamic restriction Eq. 6 becomes: K=KIK2 = (k+l/k-1) (k+2/k_2) (6') With the balance equation for the concentrations of the free, [XI] and covered, 1X2], sites 1X11+1X21 =1 (8') V T Popa, E.

Finally, Eqs. 12-16 become: K=exp(-dG lRT) -exp(x) KI -exp(-dGi lRT) -exp(x,) K2 =exp(-4G2 /RT) -exp(x2) 4G =4Gi +4G2 x=xl +x2 AGO =(dG*_,-4G+i)+(dG$2-dG+2) x=(x+i-x_,)+(x+2-x_2) (15') 4GI =AG'-, -4G+i, dGz =4G$2-dG+2 xi=x+i-x_1, x2=x+2- x_2. (16') The TM assumes a downhill-uphill [ 13,14] combination of the two steps, i.e. dG i < 0, dGz > 0, ( x, > 0, x2 < 0) for e.g. a thermodynamically favourable overall reaction (dG < 0, x > 0) . We now introduce the \"linear free energy\"-type relationships (similar to the Bronsted ones) for the downhill directions + 1 and - 2 of the two steps AG, 1 =C + al AG,' AG- 2=CZ-a24Gz x_2=C2-a2 x2 (28) where C1,2., C,,2 are constants and 0 < a,, a2 < 1 are the so-called transfer coefficients and assume a finite range for the variation of x, (dG; ) 58 VT.

Introducing the supplementary assumption of the TM, a1 = a2 = a (33) and taking into account Eq. 31, the more general expression of the LTR Eq. 11' reduces to the classical Temkin one a+ja+2 -a_ Ia_2 u~=Fi(t)= (a+I +a_2)exp[(a-1) t] +(a_I +a+2)exp(at) (34) where a+I =K+I[AI], a -I =K-I[A31, a+2=K+z[Az], a-2 =K-2[A4] (35) The nonuniformity is thus described by a single independent variable, t, in Eq. 35 instead of three independent variables, e.g., x+ 1, x_ 1, x+2 (in Eqs. 1 V and 16') due to the specific assumptions (Eqs. 28 and 33) of TM. By means of the new variable, u, __ [XIl __ k-I[A31 +k+2[A2l u [X21 k+I[All +k_2[A4] - a-, +a+2 exp(t)=uoexp(t)=u(t) (36) a+I +a_2 which represents the local ratio between free and covered sites and in the righthand side expression of which Eqs. 31, 32 and 35 were taken into account, the LTR takes a typical factorized form VT.

The specific distribution function of the TM is the exponential G,(t)=yexp(yt)/[exp(yj)-1] including the constant distribution as a particular case (for y-0, G(t) 1/f=const). In terms of the variables t or a (Eq. 20) reads: < V= f Fr(t)G,(t)dt= f F (u) G (u)(dtldu)du 0 uo with Eqs. 30 and 36 taken into account.

(O) Now, the whole nonuniformity influence is embodied in the \"Temkin factor\", uT(m), the only one bearing kinetic relevance, i.e., containing the concentration dependence of the OTR. All other factors in Eq. 43 can be grouped in a constant one, with no kinetic meaning; the clear overestimation involved in Eq. 43 is not so 60 V T Popa, E. Segal /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 94 (1994) 47-69 important when analyzing experimental data as the total number of sites, necessary in the evaluation of the turnover rate, is in most cases an approximate value (included in the constant factor). Therefore, TM is extremely convenient in fitting experimental data by means of rate equations like Eq. 41 and eventually simplified versions of it (in the form of the already mentioned power laws). However, the limits extension in Eq. 40, which is the compulsory step towards such a convenience, leads to erroneous conclusions in some instances. The rather extended resumption of the TM, presented here, is necessary for a better emphasis on its shortcomings. As far as we know, the following discussion is entirely novel. 4.2. The corrected TM Temkin claimed that Eq. 43 (in fact a similar one obtained through algebraic manipulations) \"holds with m=0 for small coverages and with m=1 for large coverages\" [ 3 ] . From Eqs. 35, 41 and 43 we get, for m = 0, K+1[A1]K+2[A2]-K_,[A3]K-2[A4] (45) V(0)=covT(0)=co K+1[A,]+K+2[A2] whereas for m=1, _ K+i [A I] K+2[A2] - K_, [As] K-2[A4] (46) WO K+1[A1]+K-2[A4] Now, kinetically speaking, Eq. 45 is formally identical with Eq. 9' if k_,[A3] +k+2[A2] k+,[A,] +k-2[A4] (or, taking into account Eq. 36, if [XII [X2] ), i.e., with the uniform-like rate equation for small coverages; whereas Eq. 46 is formally identical with the uniform-like one for large coverages ([X2] [X,] ). If the nonuniform surface coverage is really small or large such similarities are, naturally, expectable (the assertion that nonuniformity is not manifested at extreme coverages is essentially correct). But putting m = 0 or m =1 in Eq. 43 may have nothing to do with the real overall coverage of the nonuniform surface. The simple resemblance of the rate equations is not a proof, it is merely causality reversing. In fact, at m = 0 and m =1 the integral in Eq. 40 becomes divergent, so that Eq. 43 is no longer valid (co - - and c, -> -) . There is no difficulty in getting the correct expressions of the overall rate directly from Eq. 40. Thus for, m = 0 ( y= a), V(0) -c(0)VT(0) j lauu =c(0)VT(0)ln ~o c(0) = e~ , (45') uO f whereas for m =1 (y= a -1) , VT Popa, E.

Eqs. 45' and 46' are rigorously valid whatever the actual values of the local coverage at both ends of the nonuniformity range. If these eventually obey Temkin's additional requirement 1- 90 1, Of 1 u0 1, u0 exp(f) 1 (48) then V(O) -C(O) K+ l [AI I K+2[A2J - K-1 [A31 K-2[A41 In ( K-1 [A31 '+' K+2[A2] ef) K-1[A31+K+2[A2]( K+1[All+K-2[A4] (45\") V(1)-C(1) K+1 [AIIK+2[A2]-K-1[AAK-2[A41 In (K+1[Aj+K_2[A41) K+l[Aj+K_2[A41( K-1[A31+K+2[A2J (46\") Eqs. 45\" and 46\" represent the corrected alternative versions of the TM ones Eqs. 45 and 46 in the case of \"medium coverages\" defined by Eq. 48. The logarithmic factor obviously has a slower variation with the concentrations, [Ail, but this is by no means negligible. Thus, consistently following Temkin's prescriptions leads to rate equations not amenable to the idea of low or high coverages or of the nonuniformity attenuation (erasing). The above considerations pertain to the limiting cases m = 0 ( y= a) and m =1 ( y= a -1) , but a more general, mathematically rigorous solution is at hand. Taking into account Eq. 47, Eq. 40 can be written: o VW -C(Y)1)T(m) f g.n 1(1 g) 'de 0 6t - J em ' (1- e) mdel c(Y) = exp('Yf) -1 (49) ~JJ0 62 Now, if V T. Popa, E. Segal /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 94 (1994) 47-69 m>0 y< a (50) a weaker constraint than Eq. 44, the two integrals in Eq. 49 represent incomplete beta functions (Euler's first kind integrals) [39] and the OTR simply reads: V(m) -c(y)vT(m) [B(m; 1-m; Bo) -B(m; 1-m; Of) ] . (51) Naturally, Eq. 51 is more complicated than its classical TM rival Eq. 43, yet it is mathematically correct. The additional assumption Eq. 48 allows for simplification by means of the important power series expansions ( and keeping only the first terms) B(m; 1-m; 60)= T(m)T(1-m)-9o(l-O0)'-'/(1-m) 1-Oo 1 B(m; 1-m; 9f)= Bf(1-9f)' -'lm (52) (53) with T's being Eider's integrals of the second kind (gamma functions); their product in Eq. 52 equals 7r/sin Inn [38,39]. Taking into account Eq. 47 the local rate can be expressed as UL(a, e)=UT(a)ea(1_e)1 -a wherefrom, combining Eqs. 51-53 and 43, we get: V(m)=UT(m)-uL(m, 90)1(1-m)-uL(m,Bf)lm Eq. 54 is, in principle, the correct result of the TM with all its assumptions included ( if the local coverage is indeed high enough at t = 0 and low enough at t=f the series truncations in Eqs. 52 and 53 entail negligible errors). Note the already mentioned overestimation of the classical TM overall rate, VT(m), evidenced by the two correction terms in Eq. 54, the values of which are governed by both local mechanism an distribution function ( see Eqs. 37 and 38, 42 and 47 ) . (37') (54) 4.3. The overall coverage There is no principial problem in getting the overall coverage, i9, Or i9= f B(t)G,(t)dt= f BGt(t( 9) ) (dtldO)d8 0 Taking into account Eqs. 36, 38 and 47 19 ,},u o r exp ( yf) -1 (55) o J e-Y(1-e)Y-'de Or (56) V T Popa, E.

Note, once again, the same kind of overestimation as that encountered in the expression of the OTR, as well as the more restricted range of y. However, even if Eq. 61 gives unrealistic negative values of OT for e.g. 0 > y> -1, this is not the case with the exact expression Eq. 58 and even with the approximate one Eq. 60. (For negative Y's, which are allowed by Eq. 57 but not by Eq. 44, the truncations in the series expansions Eqs. 52 and 53 may become inaccurate and some more refined formulae are needed for quantitative estimations, which are beyond the scope of this paper.) Let us evaluate the overall coverage for some distributions (values of y) and illustrate the \"medium coverage\" assumption Eq. 48 with the initial conditions: (i) f =10 which ensures a \"broad nonuniformity\" [ 3,8 ] and (ii) 80 = 0.99 meaning that sites with t = 0 exhibit a high enough coverage; then Eq. 47' gives Of= 0.0045 so that sites with t=f=10 exhibit a low enough coverage and Eq. 48 holds. In this case the constant distribution yields, through Eq. 59, 29(0) =0.46; the overall coverage is indeed \"medium\", although it readily shifts towards lower or higher values, depending on 00 and f. Mathematically speaking this result is quite trivial, but it cannot be extended, without restrictions, to the exponential distribution. In the later case, taking 90 and f as above and making use of the approximate expression Eq. 60, we get 13(0.5) = 0.10 and 19( - 0.5) = 0.85. Remembering that m = a - y (Eq. 42) , if a = 0.5 these values pertain to m = 0 and m =1, respectively. Thus, with the chosen initial conditions a transfer coefficient around one half ensures O V T Popa, E. Segal /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 94 (1994) 47-69 relatively low or high overall coverages for distributions with y=0.5 (m=0) or y= -0.5 (m=1), respectively. This is no longer valid for values of a closer to both ends of its range (the occurrence of which has been outlined by Ichikawa [ 13,14 ]) . So, taking m = 0 and y= a = 0.1 result in 19(0.1) = 0.36, whereas with m =1, y = - 0.1 and a = 0.9, 19( - 0.1) =- 0.56. B oth values are closer to the medium than to the low or high ones, respectively presumed by Temkin [ 3 ] . Allowing for negative values of y, i.e., form > 1, the corrected model predicts a totally covered nonuniform surface ( ia- 1) for y -j - oo (m -j -) , that is for a delta-type distribution ( Gt( t) -> 8(t) ) . At the upper value y=1 Eq. 58 yields [ 39 ] '0(I)=(ef-1) '[eo/(1-eo)]ln(eo/Of) (62) which gives, for f and 00 as above, i~(1) = 0.02. Thus, the corrected model predicts low coverages at higher values of y. A noteworthy comparison can be made between the overall coverages of the corrected (Eq. 60) and classical (Eq. 61) TM for 0.1 <- y< 1 when the later gives physically acceptable values: 19(0.1) = 0.36 and OT(O.1) = 0.94; 19(0.5) = 0.10 and 1~T (0.5) = 0.11; x(0.9) = 0.03 and t9T(0.9) = 0.07, etc. The respective values are closest for y= 0.5; at both ends of this interval the classical model gives erroneous and even unrealistic coverages (above unity). It should be recalled that all the above numerical estimations pertain to the chosen initial conditions which we considered a fair illustration of the TM additional assumption, Eq. 48 and which could not be valid in any specific instance. Anyway, these semiquantitative considerations support the allegations made in the second part of the present section: within the corrected TM, if m = 0 ( y= a) the overall coverage is generally below 0.5, but not necessarily low; if m =1 ( y= a -1) the overall coverage is generally above 0.5, but not necessarily high, its real values being governed by the transfer coefficient, a. The corresponding kinetics are rigorously described by Eqs. 45' and 46' or, if Eq. 48 holds, by Eqs. 45\" and 46\", respectively. 4.4. The water-gas shift reaction: prototype of two-step sequences In spite of mechanistic complications occurring in various instances, extensively reviewed by Salmi [40], carbon monoxide conversion, also termed water-gas shift reaction (WGSR), H20+CO=Hz +COZ (5\") is one of the most widely used physical (or rather chemical) support for two-step mechanisms like Eq. l' [3,8]. On magnetite-based (Fe304) catalysts the active sites were assumed to be X, = * and XZ = O* representing nonstoichiometric (oxygen vacancies) and stoichiometric surface oxide, respectively. In Eq. l' A, = H20, A2 = CO, A3 = HZ and A4 = CO2. The kinetic analysis performed by Temkin himself [ 3 ] perfectly illustrates the above-mentioned inconsistencies of the classical TM. V.T. Popa, E. Segall Journal of Molecular Catalysis 94 (1994) 47-69 65 The original discussion refers to specific reaction rates (expressed, e.g. in mol s-' m-2) which are supposed to be proportional to the turnover rates, adopted throughout the present paper. From the point of view of the TM, the kinetic analysis consists primarily in finding the conditions within which the Temkin factor, VT, given by Eq. 41 (or even some simplified version of it) is transformed into the best fitting empirical expression. This is due to the already mentioned fact that in Eq. 43 there is no other factor of the overall rate accounting for the concentrations dependence. One of the earliest studies of this reaction [41 ] simultaneously (even slightly before) yielded a power rate law similar to that describing ammonia synthesis [ 16 ] . It was found that experimental data are described through Vak+[CO]([H20]/[H2])\"-k-[C02]([H2]/[H20])' \" n~0.5. (63) As the concentrations (partial pressures) of the reaction participants were of the same order of magnitude it was assumed that A = K+, / K-2 1. Then, taking into account Eq. 6', which has to be valid on the whole nonuniform surface and thus even on sites with t = 0, K _ 1 / K+2 =A /K; for the investigated temperature range (600-800 K) K- 101, so that if K+, K-2, necessarily K_ 1 K+2. Under these circumstances a+, a-2, a_, a+2 and Eq. 41 becomes UT(m) =a+2(a+ila_1)1-`-a_2(a_,la+j)' (O) which readily yields Eq. 63 by means of Eq. 35, 43 and the above given notations A1=H20, ..., etc., with k+ =K+2(K+1/K_1)1 m=K+2(Ki)1 ' (65) k_ =K_2(K_1/K+1)m=K-2(Kl) `n and m =1- n. Separate measurements of \"chemical adsorption equilibrium\" *+H20-- *O+H2 on pure magnetite proved the logarithmic isotherm thus indicating, within the classical TM, the constant distribution and thus m = a = 0.5. This was considered valid even for a commercial chromia promoted catalyst (93%Fe203 + 7%Cr203 prior to reduction) investigated later [ 38 ] in the same composition and temperature conditions. However, in the latter case a different empirical equation Va kQH20] [CO] -K-' [C02] [H2] (66) k' [H20] + [C021 was found to fit the data with k and k' being temperature dependent Eq. 66 is evidently of the classical (LHHW) type, in spite of the nonuniformity; it puzzled 66 VT. Popa, E. Segal /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 94 (1994) 47-69 Temkin forcing him to resort to the artifice m=1 in Eq. 43. Eq. 46 so obtained agrees with Eq. 66 if k'=A=K+1/ K-2 k=K+IK+21K-2 (67) As mentioned above, this procedure is wrong twice: firstly, the correct kinetic equation for m =1 is Eq. 46' (or eventually Eq. 46\") and not Eq. 46; secondly, the overall coverage for the assumed constant distribution is given by Eq. 59 and, as seen in the preceding subsection, it lies around 0.5 for typical TM values of Oo and f. Temkin had to presume a value of unity for matching his model with the experiment, without any direct experimental evidence on the real coverage. Moreover, analyzing the data on the Fe-Cr catalyst by means of Eq. 66 yielded a value of k' =A < 1, whereas Eq. 64 is obtained only if A 1. This was even more embarrassing: it meant that two similar nonuniform catalysts performing the same reaction, within the same temperature and composition conditions, exhibit mutually conflicting rate equations which Temkin's model cannot accommodate. The usual explanation of catalyst poisoning was advanced by the author [ 3 ) , but this clearly bypasses the problem. The presented mean-value theorem offers a solution under some reasonable assumptions: (i) reaction (5\") takes place through the same two-step mechanistic sequence l' on both nonuniform catalysts; (ii) the two distributions are different, due to the contribution of the chromia promoter. (We may resume here the fact that deriving distribution functions from adsorption or even \"chemical adsorption\" equilibria is a questionable procedure. However, this is beyond the scope of the present paper and will be the object of a subsequent contribution). The MVT is expressed through Eq. 23; for the two-step sequence it means that the overall rate is given by the local one's expression Eq. 9' with the rate constants taking their MVT values, Etj. All we have to do is to find the conditions within which Eq. 9' reduces to (or properly approximates) empirical rate laws such as Eq. 63 or Eq. 66. This is most common in classical (uniform) kinetics and one may question the worth of all the trouble involved in modelling the nonuniformity. In fact, it is only the nonuniformity (together with the mean-value theorem, but not confined to the TM framework) that enables the solving of kinetic puzzles such as the abovementioned one. Indeed, the discrepancy between the empirical Eqs. 63 and 66 can be explained on the basis of the same classical expression (pertaining to the local mechanism) if different distributions are assumed. The specific form of the latter is, at least for the moment, of no consequence. What matters is the difference between the two MVT sets of rate constants, C:,j, as a result of the difference between distributions. Suppose, e.g. for the pure magnetite catalyst, that within the whole experimental range investigated the MVT kinetic constants are subject to the relationship: k+i[H201 =k_1 [H2l k+2[COl, k-2[CO21 (6 If the concentrations (partial pressures) are of the same order of magnitude this happens when k+, ..~-k_, k+2, k-2 or, taking into account Eq. 24, when VT Popa, E. Segal /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 94 (1994) 47-69 k+,lk-, =K, = 1 k+ 2/k-2 =KZ = K 67 (69) Then, making use of Eq. 68, after some manipulations in Eq. 9' with ktj -ktj and combining it with Eq. 23 the overall rate takes the approximate form: Vak+2[C0]O-k-2[C02](1-O) , with O=K,[HZO]/[HZ]/(1+K,[H20]/[HZ]) (70) (71) Now for 0.5 < K, [ H20 ] / [ H21 < 2, which is the case if Eq. 68 holds, the O and 1- O factors are well approximated through O=0.5(Kl[H20]/[Hz]) .s I-O=0.5(Kl[Hz0]/[H2])-o.s (72) combining Eqs. 72 and 70 result in Eq. 63 with k, =k+2(kl)0'5 k- =k-20C) -0\"5 (73) One can easily recognize in Eq. 68 the conditions of the well-known rate-determining step approximation [8] of classical (uniform) kinetics. With, however, a major difference: in our case this approximation must hold only on the MVTselected zone and not on the whole nonuniform surface, in contrast with the TM for which the contrary was proved [ 8 ] . Note also the resemblance between Eq. 65 and 73, giving the empirical kinetic parameters in terms of model ones: they involve the same mechanistic rate-constants, yet correspond to different (local) zones of the nonuniform surface. Now, in the case of the Fe-Cr catalyst, Eq. 9' leads to the empirical equation if k+1, k-2 k-,, k+2 (74) with not too large differences in the partial pressures of the reaction participants. In fact, due to Eq. 6', if Eq. 74 holds for only one pair of rate-constants, say k+, and k-, , it is compulsory for the second one: k, ilk-, -K, 1 -k+2/k-Z =KZ 1 So, if we assume that the different site-distribution function of the chromia promoted catalyst yields a MVT set of kinetic constants obeying Eq. 75, the local equation Eq. 9' for ktj -ktj turns into the empirical one Eq. 66 with k=k+ik+2/k_2=k+A k'=A=k+ilk_2 Once again, the resemblance between TM Eq. 67 and MVT 76 expressions of the experimental rate-constants is manifested. It is even closer in this case as, considering Eqs. (29-31) and 6', one can see that the maximum value of K, (and minimum of Kz) corresponds to t = 0 and so (76) K+ 1/K_ I -Kj 1 > K+2/K-z =KZ 1 (75') 68 V T Popa, E. Segal /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 94 (1994) 47-69 We may state that in this case even Temkin's original procedure is closely related to the mean-value theorem, the author not being aware of this. Indeed, in forcing his nonuniform rate-equation Eq. 43 to take a classical form Eq. 66 he is driven to a zone at one end (t=0) of the nonunifonnity range and arbitrarily extends its properties (e.g. coverage) to the whole surface. It is precisely what the presented approach avoids by means of the rigorously introduced mean-value theorem. Within its framework, overall kinetics are governed by the MVT-selected parameters, ascribed to some zone, but obviously not to the whole nonuniform surface. 5. Conclusions Including of the surface nonuniformity into multi-step, single-route catalytic reactions was achieved with no principial difficulties. The model thus elaborated, although seemingly hopeless for analytical solutions, leads to some general conclusions through the application of a mean-value theorem: Single-route reactions generally exhibit kinetic insensitivity, i.e., they are correctly described by classical kinetic equations in spite of the nonuniform catalytic activity. The new model accounts for instances when, due to restructuring processes, the biographic nonuniformity is erased. Structure sensitivity/ insensitivity is, in principle, allowed within both the above situations. For two-step sequences the model reduces to the Temkin one, reveals some of its not yet reported inconsistencies, and offers a means of correction: Classical TM generally overestimates the overall rate and in some limiting cases erroneously predicts both kinetic equations and overall coverages; for these the corrected solutions are easily derived. If the original assumptions of the TM hold, kinetic equations of power law type are not a consequence of the nonuniformity, but of the particular way in which the classical models deals with it, i.e. of the specific simplifications involved. In catalytic processes the evolution of which can be described only by power or more complicated rate laws, mechanistic multiplicity is to be suspected in the first place. However, if such processes are single-route, then the associated site-distribution is most probably changing within the experimental (composition and temperature) investigated range.

Republicii 13, Bucharest, Romania. A new model for single-route, steady-state reactions on nonuniform catalytic surfaces is presented. Giving up some assumptions of the Temkin model and making use of a common mean-value theorem result in the introduction of the concept of kinetic insensitivity. The model rigorously accounts for the existence of a broad class of reactions the evolution of which is accurately described by “classical kinetics” (derived on ideal, uniform surfaces). The connections with structure sensitivity/insensitivity are examined in relation with the frequently invoked effect of surface restructuring. The application to two-step sequences leads to the classical Temkin model (as a particular case) and reveals some of its shortcomings, not yet reported.
