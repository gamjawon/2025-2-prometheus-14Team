Introduction Ziegler-type cobalt catalysts are highly active and selective m liquid phase polymerization and hydrogenation processes of both industrial and technological importance Oligomenzation of butadiene [ 1 ] , copolymerization of vinyl acetate with acrylonitrile [ 2 ] , and synthesis of alkenes and alcohols via hydrogenation of CO (Fischer-Tropsch) [ 3,4 ] are important examples of such processes, involving * Corresponding author ' On leave from University El Mima, Egypt mnn c In') /QA/-W7 /ln 0) 1994 Flcevier Science B V All rights reserved 290 J Barrault et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysts 93 (1994) 289-304 cobalt catalysts Moreover during the last decade, the catalysts have been found active m the selective hydrogenation of nitnle [ 5 ] and in the formation of fine chemicals via hydrogenation of a, ssl3-unsaturated carbonyl derivatives [ 6] The catalysts are often obtained from the reaction of cobalt acetylacetonate [Co(acac)2 [7] or Co(acac)3 [8] ]withaluminiumtnalkyl [ Al (R) 31 in an organic solvent Reductive ligand-exchange reactions occur immediately at room temperature, whereby a range of soluble metal complexes (of Co, Al, and possibly CoAl), Co' metal particles and free hydrocarbons may be produced [ 8,9] The nature of these complexes are largely controlled by differences in preparation [ 8,9 ] , vii , the Al/Co ratio, the sequence of reagent mixing, the nature of the alkyl group of Al (R) 3, the initial oxidation state of Co, and the nature of the solvent An additional parameter is high temperature treatment often necessitated by hydrogenation processes [3,4] Many studies, dealing with the catalyst, have been focused on the activity and selectivity as a function of preparation method (e g , [ 2 ] ) In contrast, few studies have tackled the formation and nature of the catalyst active species [ 8 ] . The present investigation aims basically to characterize the chemical reactions occurring from the mixing of solutions of Co(acac)2 and Al(Et)3, and the formation of catalyst, used for the selective hydrogenation of a,/3-unsaturated carbonyl derivatives [ 5,6 ] It implements the potential of F17-IR spectroscopy, in resolving the chemical complexity inherent to the preparation medium[ 8,9 ] This approach has been motivated by previous IR studies of analogous Ziegler-type catalysts [ 10,11 ] Moreover, the investigation adopted recommended techniques and conditions so as to warrant sample manipulation and measurements m air-free atmosphere [ 12 ] 2. Experimental 21 Materials The cobalt acetylacetonate (Co (acac) 2, acac = CSH802; 98 wt%-Co) aluminium tnethyl (Al (Et) 3, Et = C2H5, 93 wt%-Al), acetylacetonate (Al (acac) 3, 98 wt%Al) and isopropoxide (Al (lPr) 3, iPr = C3H70) were Merck products Co (acac) 2 and Al (acac)3 was dried at 10-2 Torr and 55 C for 8 h, prior to application The solvents used were benzene (Bz), (99% Prolabo) for low-temperature handling, and dodecane (Dod ) , (99 % Interchim) for high-temperature treatments Benzene was distilled (under N2) in the presence of sodium metal and benzophenone, according to a standard procedure [ 13 ] 2 2 Co(acac)2 reduction 8 71 g of dried Co (acac) 2 were dissolved in 220 ml of dried benzene at room temperature (RT), under argon atmosphere After cooling down to 6 C, a 5 ml J Barrault et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 93 (1994) 289-304 291 portion of Al (Et)3 (Al /Co=1) was added by means of an air-tight syringe. The colour darkened immediately and a suspension of fine particles was formed A 60 ml portion of dodecane was added and benzene was eliminated by distillation at 60 C under hydrogen A slurry was obtained which was then transferred into an all-Pyrex glass reactor and the temperature was raised slowly up to 180 C under HZ The slurry was maintained at this temperature for 2 h prior to any further change In certain instances, reduction conditions were vaned the Al/Co ratio (0 5-1 5) , the reduction temperature (RT-180 C) and duration (5 mm, 18 h) In order to monitor changes in the nature of the species formed during this preparation, we also studied the adsorption-reduction of carbon monoxide diluted in hydrogen (25-30 vol%) at atmospheric pressure 2 3 Sampling procedures and tools for IR analysis Recommendations and techniques put forward by De Liefde Meyer et al [ 12] for IR sampling under absolute air-free conditions were strictly considered A SPECACIR-cell of 0 025 mm thickness, equipped with KBr windows, was placed inside an evacuable desiccator, together with a small beaker. The desiccator was equipped with two ground onfices terminated with greaseless taps, as well as fittings necessary for connection to a gas/vacuum line The desiccator and the fittings were subjected to three successive cycles of evacuation-Ar flushing Finally, an Arpressure was maintained to avoid readmission of air The test sample was then delivered into the cell by means of a dry, hypodermic syringe. For the sake of cautiousness, the very first drops of the sample were dispensed into the beaker With the help of special tongs, the cell ports were blocked with Ar-flushed Teflon corks Eventually, the cell was transferred, in air, into the sample compartment of the IR spectrophotometer (vide infra), which was continuously being purged with dry NZ 2 4. Infrared spectroscopy IR absorption spectra were taken, over the frequency range from 400 to 4800 cm-', using a N2-purged model lOMX Nicolet FT-spectrophotometer equipped with a data acquisition and handling system All spectra were taken at beam temperature, i e close to RT, and observed frequencies were accurate to within t 2 cm-1 The chemical complexity of test samples was resolved by means of difference spectra These were obtained by absorption subtraction of spectra recorded under identical spectroscopic conditions The subtraction was facilitated by the interfaced data handling system It is worth reporting, that gas phase components in the test samples were undetectable, for the very short optical pathlength of the cell employed (0 025 mm thick) 292 J Barrault et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 93 (1994) 282304 2.5.

Results and discussion 31 Chemical consequences of mixing Al(Et)3 and Co(acac)3 at room temperature 31 1 As a function of the AUCo ratio Fig 1 compares IR spectra of benzene solutions of Al (Et) 3 and Co (acac) 2 at various Al/Co ratios, namely at Al/Co of 0 5, 1 0 and 1 5. The figure also insets the spectrum taken from Co (acac) 2 solution prior to addition of Al (Et) 3, 1 e , at Al/Co=0 0 The solvent contribution was almost completely eliminated by subtraction Frequencies of characteristic absorptions exhibited by separate solutions of Co (acac)2 and At (Et)3 below 2000 cm-', are summarized m Table 1. The table also summarizes frequencies of absorptions observed at < 2000 cm-' for the reference compounds of Al (acac) 3, Al (Et) 2 (acac) and Al (iPr) 3 Fig 1 shows that the addition of Al (Et) 3 to Co (acac) 2 (A1 /Co = 0.5) induced some detectable changes m the IR spectrum of Co(acac)2 The most important changes, are the emergence of new absorptions at 1533, 1289, 1027, 939, and 490 cm-' Moreover, the absorption at 1401 cm-' splits into two strongly overlapping but weaker absorptions at 1410 and 1391 cm-' On the other hand, some of the initial absorptions, due to Co(acac)2, weaken significantly (e.g , at 1519, 1260, 924 cm -' ) , whereas others undergo slight frequency shifts (e g ,from 1591 to 1596 cm-', from 1196 to 1194 cm-', and from 420 to 425 cm-') and grow stronger In terms of the reference data compiled m Table 1 and other reports [ 15], these changes show that Al (Et) 3 is transformed into Al (acac) 3 species The newly emerging absorptions at 1533, 1289, and 490 cm-' are diagnostic to the formation of Al(acac)3 (Table 1) The 1533 and 1289 cm-' absorptions seem (Fig 1) to be high-frequency modifications of Co(acac)2 absorptions at 1519 (v(CO) + v(C-C) ) and 1260 cm-' ( v(C-C) + v(C-CH3) ) , respectively This implies that acetylacetonate ligands are now coordinated to a stronger Lewis acid centre (Al) than Co [ 16] The emergence of the 490 cm-' absorption indicates stretching vibrations of Al-O bonds [ 8 ] , which can be correlated with the slight high-frequency shift of the 420 cm-' absorption ( v(Co-O) ) to 425 cm-' (out of plane bending of At (acac)3) [8,15] J Barrault et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysts 93 (1994) 289-304 OZC-C-S-- O -o S06 ~ 6 6 196 886 OZOI LZOI Szb Z6P 06b S DZ6 0911 Y6li- LZZI 09ZI 9611 6151 US l~ 9691 1651 6091 -

The 7r-bonding becomes more important as the oxidation state of the metal becomes lower, since the metal must back-donate more electrons to olefin It has also been found [ 19,20] that most of the IR absorptions of free C2H4 undergo significant frequency shifts upon bonding to metal atoms These absorptions occur at 1623 ( v(C=C) ), 1342 ( 8s (CH2) ),1236 and 810 (p, (CH2) ), 1007 (pt (CH2) ) and 943 cm -' (p,, (CH2)) [ 19,20 ] Upon bonding to Pt, for example, these absorptions shift to 1526, 1418, 1251, 844, 730 and 1023 cm-', respectively [20] If they were occurring, all of these absorptions, except for the ones at 844 and 730 cm-', would have been completely shrouded by absorptions of Al (acac)3 296 J Barrault et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 93 (1994) 289-304 and AI (Et) 2 (acac) (Fig 1) A thorough inspection of the frequency range at 900500 cm-1 (not shown in Fig 1) revealed the display of a sharp absorption at 860 cm - t and a broad one at 850-760 cm -' in the spectrum taken following the reaction at Al/Co=1 5, notwithstanding that such an absorption might be related to vibrations of olefinic species bound to Coo atoms, and indicated the formation of Co(C2H4)x species So, IR observations accumulated in the present study can help to make concrete conclusions as to the nature of the soluble Coo complexes 3 1 2 As a function of time In order to check on the importance of the reaction duration, IR spectra were taken following the elapse of increasing periods (from 25 min to 18 h) of mixing benzene solutions of Al (Et) 3 and Co (acac) 2 (AI/ Co =1 0) at room temperature Spectra obtained at 1320-1160 cm-' are represented in Fig 2. The spectra show clearly that the chemical consequences of mixing the reagents, i.e , the appearance a 0,32 (d) 134o I3oo 1 26o 1220 1190 wAVErIUAMRs (cm-') Fig 2 IR spectra taken from a 1 I mixed solution of Al(Et)3 and Co(acac)2, at room temperature Spectra of separate solutions of the precursors are inset for comparative purposes (a) Co(acac)Z, (b) t=25 mm, (c) t=18 h, (d) AI(acac)3 J Barrault et al l Journal of Molecular Catalyses 93 (1994) 289-304 297 of charactensric absorptions of Al (acac) 3, occur shortly after mixing at room temperature. The same was indicated by the GC analysis of gas phase products, which showed the completion of maximum production of C2H6 (Table 2) after the elapse of 3 mm of mixing These results indicate, m line with earlier reports [ 1 ], that reductive ligand-exchange interactions involving Al(Et)3 and Co(acac)2 are instantaneous 3 2 Chemical consequences of heating mixed solutions of Al(Et)3 and Co(acac)2 at high temperatures The synthesis of the catalytic active species m the Al(Et) 3 and Co(acac) 2 system imposes the following alterations (see Expenmental) replacement of benzene by dodecane, switching the gas atmosphere from Ar (or N2) into HZ and heating up to 180 C Therefore, expenments were designed to let IR observe chemical changes accompanying heating the catalyst precursor system to vanous mtennediate temperatures up to 180 C This was accomplished by taking spectra after hearing at the desired temperature (60, 100, 120, 160 and 180 C) for 1 to 4 h and subsequent cooling to room temperature The resulting spectra were compared with the spectra obtained pnor to heating This comparison revealed that differences appeared only at T> 100 C Therefore, Fig 3 only compares the spectra obtained before and after heating a mixture of Al (Et) 3 and Co (acac) 2 (Al /Co =1 0) at 180 C. The comparison reveals that charactensric absorptions displayed for the initial reaction products at room temperature are very much weakened on heating up to 180 C. Alternatively, several new absorptions emerged Some of these absorptions could be attnbuted to metal-C2114 (e g , at 2966, 2929, 1525, 844 and 738 cm-' [20] ) and some others to alkoxide-type species (e g , at 2955, 2916, 2910, 1525, 1465, 1369,1340,1261,1240,1177-1138, 955, 844 and 770 cm-' [21,22] ). Absorption frequencies compiled m Table 1 for Al (iPr) 3 lend support to the assignment given to the latter set of absorptions It is worth noting, however, that absorptions displayed m spectrum (b) of Fig 3 (i e , following heating at 180 C), particularly those at 1650-1500 cm-', still account for metal-acac species Nevertheless, they cannot support that these species are associated with Co (acac) 2 or Al (acac) 3 The acac species are presumably contributing to a sort of mixed Co-A1 complexes, or to mixed ligand complexes of Coo In order to identify reasons behind these remarkable, heat induced changes m the chemical composition of the reaction medium, the following expenment was carved out A 1 5 1 mixed solution of Al (Et) 3 and Al (acac) 3 was heated, under H2 at 180 C for 1 h, and then cooled to room temperature.

IR spectra were also taken as a function of time-on-stream In a second set of experiments Al (Et) 3 and Co (acac) 2 (Al/ Co =1) were mixed at room temperature under H2 atmosphere and the temperature was increased up to 180 C At each step, a (CO, H2) mixture (30% CO) was contacted with the solution and CO spectra were taken at room temperature and 80 C In the frequency range 1750-2000 cm-' corresponding to v(CO) vibrations of chemisorbed carbonyl groups [ 23,25 ] we observed significant changes (Fig 5 ) The room temperature carbonylation of the reaction mixture pretreated at room temperature results in a spectrum (a, Fig 5) displaying weak P(CO) absorptions at 1991,1950 and 1790 cm-' The former two absorptions are assignable to terminal carbonyls (M-CO) coordinated to two different types of metal atoms, whereas the latter absorption is indicative of mulricentered carbonyls ((M)x-CO) [23,25]. When the carbonylation was carried out at 80 C (spectra c), the terminal-CO absorptions intensified considerably, with the maximum being shifted to 1996 cm-' In the meantime, the multicentered carbonyls transformed into bndgingCO, ( (M)2-CO), as indicated by the high frequency shift to 1850 cm-' [23,25] Since the v(CO) of free CO molecules occurs at 2143 cm-' [23], the frequencies observed at room temperature and 80 C account for carbonyl groups coordinated to electron-rich sites with of back donating electrons to the 27r\" anti-bonding orbital of the CO molecule [ 24 ] These are most likely associated with reduced cobalt (Coo) rather than with Al\"' or Con Thus, the CO chemisorprion probes the existence of coordmatively unsaturated (cus) Coo atoms resulting from the reductive hgand-exchange reactions referred to above The results also indicate that these reactions are further activated at the higher temperature of 80 C. The question that may be raised at this stage is whether the CO coordination centres are associated with Coo exposed on metallic particles or contained in soluble complexed species The highest v(CO) frequency observed for the terminal-CO (at 1991 cm-') is significantly less than that reported [ 23 ] for CO terminallybound to cus sites exposed on Coo particles (at 2095-2030 cm-') This fact may imply that the CO coordination centres in the present case are more electron-rich (and hence more electron-donating) than those normally exposed on Co metal J Barrault et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysts 93 (1994) 289-304 301 H a o~ a N N 'r a O~ H CO; 80 C d) 180 C 0,08 O o 0,02 Y o c) RT 00 a CO.

Conclusion The following conclusions can be drawn from the above results (1) At room temperature, there are reductive ligand-exchange reactions between Al(Et)3 and Co(acac)2 and formation of Coo particles, Coo soluble complexes, Al (acac) 3, and Al (Et) 2 (acac) in the liquid phase, C21-16 being the main gas phase product (2) The multistep transformation of reagent may be initiated through the formation of a donor-acceptor complex ( (acac)Co(acac) -+Al(Et)3) [8,9] involving the migration of an ethyl group from aluminium to cobalt [ 18 (3) The main product (C21-16) in the gas phase produced during the reaction comes from an hydrogen-abstraction mechanism (2 C2H5 -* C21-16 + C2H4) involving ethyl groups bound to alummium and cobalt, in a donor-acceptor complex as (Et) Co(acac) - Al (Et) (acac)2 (4) The presence of CO in the gas phase (HZ) when heating the reaction mixture up to 180 C, enhances the reduction of cobalt and shows that COP atoms are in different coordination symmetries within soluble complexed species (5) These Coo species exhibit different activities and selectivities towards hydrocarbon (C21-15) hydrogenolysis (to C 1) and polymerization (to C3-CS), depending on the reaction temperature Acknowledgements M I Z thanks the C N R S of France for a research associateship References [ I ] K Tama, T Saito, Y Uchida and A Misono, J Chem Soc Japan, Ind Chem Sec, (Kogyo Kagaku Zasslu), 38 (1965) 1575 [2] Y N Sharma, V G Gandhi and I S BhardwaJ, J Polymer, Sci, 18 (1980) 59 [3] M Blanchard and D Vanhove, J Chem Soc Chem Commun, 669 (1980) 908 [4] M Simon, A Mortreux, F Pent, D Vanhove and M Blanchard, J Chem Soc Chem Commun, 449 (1985) 1179 [ 5 ] M Blanchard, J Barrault and A Derouault, Stud Surf Sct Catal , 63 (1991) 687 [6] J Barrault, M Blanchard, A Derouault, M Kstbi and M I Zakr, 3rd Symp Heterogeneous Catalysis and Fine Chemical, Poitiers, France, 5-9 April 1993 [7] M Blanchard, D Vanhove, F Pent and A Mortreux, J Chem Soc Chem Commun , (1980) 908 304 J Barrault et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysts 93 (1994) 2S9-3O [ 8 ] S Pasynktewicz, A Pietrzykowski and K Dowbor, J Organomet Chem, 78 (1974) 55 [9] G V Ratovsku, T V Dtmtneva, L O Nmdakova and F K Schmidt, React Kmet Catal Lett , 11 (1979) 121 [ 10] J G Van Ommen, H J Van Der Ploeg, P C J M Van Berked and P Mars, J Mol Catal , 2 (1977) 407 [ 11 ] J G Van Ommen, P Mars and P J Gellings, J Mol Catal , 6 (1979) 145 [ 12] H J De Liefde Meyer, M J Jansen and G J M Van Der Kerk, Studies m Organic Chemistry of Vanadium, Institute for Organic Chemistry, TNO, Utrecht, 1963, p 40 [ 13 ] D N Bhattacharyya, C L Lee and al , J Phys Chem, 69 (1965) 608 [ 14] W R Kroll and W Naegelle, J Organomet Chem, 19 (1969) 439 [ 15 ] K Nakamoto, P J Mc Carthy, A Ruby and A E Martell, J Am Chem Soc, 83 (1961) 1066 and 1277 [ 16] K Nakamoto, Infrared Spectra of Inorganic and Coordination Compounds, 2nd Ed, J Wiley and Sons, London,1970,p 247-256 [ 17 ] T Oya and A Yamamoto, J Organomet Chem, 120 (1976) 257 [ 18] J Chatt and B L Shaw, J Chem Soc , (1960) 1718, (1969) 705 [ 19] K Nakamoto, Infrared Spectra of Inorganic and Coordination Compounds, 2nd Ed, J Wiley and Sons, London, 1970, p 262-268 [20] J Chatt, L A Duncanson and R G Buy, Nature, 184 (1959) 526 [ 21 ] J V Bell, J Heisler, T Tannenbaum and J Goldenson, Anal Chem, 25 (1953) 1720 [22] C T Lynch, K S Mazdiyasm, J S Smith and W J Crawford, Anal Chem, 36 (1964) 2332 [23] N Sheppard and T T Nguyen, Adv Infrared Raman Spectrosc , 5 (1978) 67 [241 M A Vanmce, Catal Rev Sci Eng, 14 (1976) 153 [ 25 ] C De La Cruz and N Sheppard, J Mol Structure, 224 (1990) 141 X244 94870012 0304-5102(94)87001-2 10.1016/0304-5102(94)87001-2 Infrared observation of the chemical consequences of cobalt catalyst produced in mixed solutions of Al(Et)3 and Co(acac)2 J.

Cobalt catalysts obtained from the reduction of Co(acac)2 with Al(Et)3 have been studied by infrared spectroscopy (in the selective hydrogenation of multifunctional compounds). These solids prepared in situ were in suspension in a liquid mixture containing solvent and reagent. In order to obtain information on the preparation and the composition of the catalyst we carried out an FT-IR characterization using a special device warranting sample manipulation in air-free atmosphere. At room temperature there were instantaneous and reductive ligand-exchange between Al(Et)3 and Co(acac)2 and formation of Co0 particles, Co0 soluble complexes and Al(Et)2(acac). The multistep process may be initiated through the formation of a donor-acceptor complex ((acac)Co(acac)→Al(Et)3). The presence of CO in the gas phase (H2) when heating the reaction mixture up to 180°C enhances the reduction of cobalt and probes Co0 in different coordination symmetries. Some of the Co0 species could be surrounded with cobalt alkoxide species and aluminium acetylacetonate.
