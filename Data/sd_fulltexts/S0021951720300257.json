Graphical abstract Pt-based alloys have been widely used as high-performance electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). These catalysts contained high Pt contents, typically 60–70 at.% or higher, since further decreasing Pt contents would significantly lower the desired electro-catalytic activity. High-entropy alloys (HEAs) with built-in stability through their low free-energy phases provided a promising route to prepare Pt-based alloy catalysts with less than 50 at.% Pt while maintaining high ORR activity and stability in various environments. In this work, we reported a top-down de-alloying synthetic method to controllably incorporate five immiscible metals in one nanoscale solid phase. By predetermining four elements (Al, Cu, Ni and Pt) and alternating the fifth element including Pd, V, Co, Mn, etc., a series of nanoporous HEAs (np-HEAs) with Pt content of ~20–30 at.% were obtained. Among these quinary alloys, the Al-Cu-Ni-Pt-Mn np-HEA exhibited the best ORR catalytic activity and electrochemical cycling durability, well exceeding the commercial Pt/C catalysts. We expected these nanostructured HEA would offer a new class of alloy catalysts in many electrochemical reactions. Keywords Mesoporous HEAs ORR Electrocatalysis Fuel cells 1 Introduction The sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a key issue which hinders the practical application of fuel cells and metal-O2 batteries [1–10]. It is known that Pt-based nanoparticles are the most active ORR electrocatalysts; however, the high cost and low natural resource of Pt greatly limit their applications. Thus, developing noble metal-free electrocatalysts or metal-free carbon-based electrocatalysts has drawn much attention in the last decade and rapid progress has been made [11,12]. For example, Fe-N-C, Co-N-C, or N-doped carbon can show ORR activity comparable to that of commercial Pt/C in alkaline solutions [11,13–15]. However, most of these materials cannot work stably in acidic solutions where proton-exchange membranes are used. Hence, further enhancing the ORR activity of Pt-based nanostructures and reducing the Pt loading amount is still urgently needed [16]. One way to tune Pt NPs’ activity is alloying Pt with other suitable metal elements [17–20]. For example, Pt-based binary and ternary alloys (PtCu, PtNi, PtCo, PtCuNi, etc.) with Pt content of ~70–60 at.% have shown much enhanced ORR activity compared with pure Pt [21–30]. The enhanced activity is due to three factors which are the ensemble effect, ligand effect and strain effect. The ensemble effect, also named synergistic effect, means the presence of another metal (M) on the Pt surface which would provide positive effect such as facilitated OH adsorption for the ORR. The ligand effect is short-range electronic charge-transfer effect and the strain effect is long-range geometric lattice strain. Both of them result in a modified electronic structure of Pt, making the Pt d-band center down-shift relative to the Fermi level [31–33]. Alloys with five or more main elements in one solid phase are usually named as high-entropy alloys (HEAs) [34,35]. Some unique mechanical and physical properties of HEAs make them very attractive as structural materials [36–40]. Potential applications of HEAs as (electro)catalysts have only recently been developed [41–43]. On the other hand, in comparison to bulk HEAs, nanoscale HEAs are more suitable for catalysis/electrocatalysis thanks to their large specific surface area, high material utilization efficiency and nanoscale size effect. However, uniformly mixing five or more metal species into one nanostructured phase is not an easy task. Quite recently, nanostructured multicomponent alloys have been successfully prepared by a bottom-up carbothermal shock method [44] and top-down dealloying method [45]. However, the effect of compositions and element combinations on a certain important reaction such as ORR has been rarely explored. In particular, the design of advanced Pt-based multi-component HEA catalysts for ORR has not been reported yet. Theoretical calculations has been used to design and predict ORR catalyst and Pt binary alloy-based volcano plot relating the alloy composition and oxygen binding energies has also been established [46]. However, the interaction between five or more elements in one solid phase is too complex to predict and may considerably affect the overall ORR activity [47]. Hence, the known volcano plots are not suitable to be used for predicting the catalytic activity of multi-component alloy. For nanoscale multi-component HEAs, the ensemble effect, ligand effect and surface strain can be widely tuned by adjusting the element kinds and compositions. Therefore, by studying the composition effects, we may find a HEA catalyst with optimized surface strain and electronic properties for ORR. In this work, we used a top-down chemical dealloying method to prepare nanoporous HEAs (np-HEAs) with different compositions. Aluminum-rich precursor alloys were chosen considering the low cost, and selective dissolution of Al in alkaline solutions. Because there are too many element combinations to be tested when the composition number reaches five or more, the predetermination of other elements based on the cost, earth abundance and eco-friendliness, is essential for the HEA catalyst design. We then chose Ni and Cu elements considering that they are abundant and can form solid solution with each other and with Pt. Moreover, alloying Pt with Ni or Cu has been proved to be effective in enhancing the ORR activity of Pt due to the suitably strained Pt surface [19,25]. Finally, a fifth element (noble or non-noble metals) was selected to further tune the surface strain and electronic properties. On the basis of these deliberations, we prepared nanoporous Al-Cu-Ni-Pt-X (X: Mn, Co, Mo, Pd, Au, etc.) and explored the composition effect of the multi-component HEAs with only ~20–30 at.% Pt. Significantly, we found that the np-HEA system (Al-Cu-Ni-Pt-Mn) can overcome the limitation of binary or ternary alloy system by exhibiting ultrahigh ORR activity with a record-low Pt content. The identified np-AlCuNiPtMn catalyst exhibits a highest half wave potential of ~0.945 in acidic media tested by rotating disk electrode (RDE) and is also highly active when tested in an alkaline primary Zn-air battery. This work demonstrates experimentally that the nanostructure HEA system can be used as a platform for advanced catalyst design owing to the numberless element combinations. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Material preparation For the Pt-based quinary precursor alloys, they all contain four identical elements and a different fifth element X (Al96Cu1Ni1Pt1X1 (at.%)). The fifth element were Mn, V, Co, Mo, Ti, Ir, Pd, Au (1 at.%). A quaternary precursor alloy Al97Cu1Ni1Pt1 and ternary precursor alloy Al96Cu2Pt2 were also studied for comparison. For Ag-based precursor alloys, they were Al96Cu1Ni1Ag1X1 (X: Mn, Mo, Ti, etc.), Al97Cu1Ni1Ag1, Al96Cu2Ag2 and Al96Ag4. They were prepared by melt-spinning method as reported in previous work [45]. Selective dealloying of the alloy ribbons (~25 μm thick and ~2 mm wide) was carried out in a NaOH solution (0.5 M) to synthesize the multinary nanoporous alloys. The catalyst inks for electrochemical test were made by mixing 4 mg as-prepared catalyst, 3 mg conductive carbon black, 300 μL isopropanol and 100 μL 0.5 wt% Nafion under sonication for 15 min. The prepared ink (~5 μL) was coated on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE, 4 mm in diameter) for the electrochemical test. For comparison, the commercial Pt/C catalyst (20 wt%, Johnson-Matthey) was also studied. 2.2 Materials characterization An X-ray diffraction (XRD) diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation, a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS), an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM) were used for the structure and composition characterization. 2.3 Electrochemical An electrochemical workstation (CHI 660e) connected with a three electrode cell was used, which includes a modified GCE, a Pt wire and Ag/AgCl as the working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The potentials vs Ag/AgCl were converted to that vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to the Nernst equation (ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 pH + 0.197). Before the ORR test, the Pt-based alloy electrodes were activated by potential cycling between 0.05 and 1.25 V (vs RHE) in 0.1 M HClO4 to reach a stable CV curve. The Ag-based alloys were activated by CV cycling between −0.23 and 0.37 V (vs RHE) in 1.0 mM H2SO4 + 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution to reach a stable state. Since Ag is not as stable as Pt, the potential range used for the activation of these Ag-based alloys is much smaller and the acidic electrolyte used is much weaker (1.0 mM H2SO4, 0.1 M Na2SO4 was also added to enhance the conductivity). The scan rate was 50 mV s−1 for the electrochemical activation. The activated Pt-based alloy electrodes were immersed in 0.1 M HClO4 solution which was then bubbled with pure CO for 20 min and pure N2 for 15 min before recording the CO stripping curves. For ORR, the scan rate of 5 mV s−1 and the rotation rate of 1600 rpm were used in 0.1 M HClO4 or 0.1 M KOH electrolytes saturated with O2. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of Pt was determined based on the H adsorption charges between 0 and 0.3 V and an H monolayer on the surface of Pt is ~210 μC cm−2. The Zn-air batteries were assembled by using pure Zn foil as the anode, the ORR catalysts (np-AlCuNiPtMn or Pt/C loaded on carbon cloth) as the cathode and 6.0 M KOH + 0.2 M ZnAc aqueous solution as the electrolyte. The loading amount of Pt is ~7 and 20 μg cm−2 for the np-AlCuNiPtMn and Pt/C, respectively. 2.4 First-principles calculations Supercell model of four (or six)-layer 2 × 2 Pt (1 1 1) surface with 15 Å vacuum slab is first constructed. Quaternary and quinary HEAs are then modelled in a simplified way by replacing part of the Pt atoms in the two central subsurface layers with Ni and Cu (and Mn in the case of quinary HEA). Each of the resultant surface models has one (or two) pure Pt overlayer(s). The calculations are performed by using the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP), based on density functional theory within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). Ultrasoft pseudopotentials are used. The cutoff energy is 600 eV, which is sufficiently high to ensure convergence. 3 × 3 × 1 k-point meshes are used. The atomic structures are relaxed until the forces on each atom are less than 0.01 eV/Å and the energy variation between two iterations is less than 4 × 10−4 eV. The standard four-electron path of ORR is considered and the free energy of reaction for each step is calculated using the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) method developed by Rossmeisl et al. [48]. The adsorption energies of the reaction intermediates are calculated as Ea = E(X*) − E(*) − E(X) where E(X*) is the total energy of the few-layer metal with the adsorbate X, E(*) is the total energy of the bare few-layer metal, E(X) is the total energy of X. The overpotential is evaluated under the equilibrium potential. 3 Results and discussion EDS analysis of the precursor alloy in Fig. S1a (Supplementary material) shows the presence of the five elements (Al96-Cu1-Ni1-Pt1-Mn1) with designed ratios. XRD patterns indicate that pure Al phase dominates in the precursor alloy owing to the high content of aluminum (Fig. 1 a). Some small peaks could be ascribed to Al3(NiCuPtX) intermetallic phase. The dealloying in alkaline solutions would remove the pure Al phase and etch the Al3(NiCuPt) phase as suggested by the XRD patterns (Fig. 1b). The formed new diffraction peak at ~40.3° (2θ) can be assigned to the (1 1 1) diffraction of a face-center cubic (fcc) structure. The broad feature of the (1 1 1) peak should imply the nano-sized crystal obtained by dealloying. Using the pure Pt (1 1 1) as reference, the formed (1 1 1) peaks shift obviously to a higher 2-theta value, suggesting the alloying with smaller Ni, Cu and X. The peak position is roughly in agreement with the value calculated by the Vegard’s law, suggesting the well mixing of these elements. EDS measurement shows that the content of the residual Al is similar with that of the added Ni, Cu, Mn, and Pt after etching. The residue Al should be inside of the NiCuPtX-based fcc alloy phase and is hard to be further etched in the alkaline dealloying solution. From the SEM (Fig. S2) and scanning TEM (STEM, Fig. 2 a) images, the dealloyed multinary alloys clearly exhibit a bimodal-like porous structure. The first-level structure is prolate solid parts with a diameter of ~100–200 nm (indicated in Fig. 2a). The prolate particles should be the dealloyed Al3(NiCuPtMn) alloy compound phase which is formed during the melt-spinning process through a spinodal decomposition manner with pure Al phase. The etching of pure aluminum phase would generate the large pores as observed in Fig. S2a and b and at the same time, the dealloying of the Al3(NiCuPtMn) phase would generate uniform and ultrafine nanopores and nano-ligaments with typical sizes of ~2–3 nm (Fig. 2a and b). The presence of ultrafine nanopores, which is further confirmed by the color contrast in TEM image (Fig. S2c), would greatly enhance the specific surface area and facilitate the mass transfer during catalysis. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Inset of Fig. 2c) shows an fcc structure of the formed np-HEA. From the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 2c), most of these diffraction distance is from the (1 1 1) lattice planes, indicating the domination of (1 1 1) planes preferred on the formed multi-component alloy. This result is also in accordance with that observed by XRD. The HRTEM image also shows that a thin metal oxides/hydroxides layer is formed because of the natural oxidation of the non-noble elements in the np-HEAs. The STEM-EDS mapping of the nanoporous Al-Cu-Ni-Pt-Mn (Fig. 2d) shows that the five components mix well in the nanoscale solid ligaments. Due the oxidation of the active elements, O can also been detected. The result demonstrates that precursor alloy design combined with dealloying is powerful to incorporate five metal elements with different atomic radius, redox potentials, and melting points into one single phase nanostructure. We also characterized other dealloyed samples by SEM and TEM (Fig. S3). The quite similar nanoporous structures suggest that the adjusting the fifth element (X) does not affect the microstructure. XPS analysis shows that the quinary np-AlCuNiPtMn surface contains platinum, copper, nickel, aluminum, manganese and oxygen (Fig. 3 a), which is in agreement with our design. The two platinum peaks in Fig. 3b correspond to the Pt 4f7/2 (~70.9 eV) and 4f5/2 (~74.5 eV) of Pt0. The Pt0 4f7/2 binding energy shifts negatively in comparison to that of Pt/C (71.3 eV), indicating the possible charge transfer between Pt and other alloy elements [49,50]. The copper 2p peak can be assigned to both Cu0 (931. eV) and Cu2+ (934.2 eV, Fig. 3c). The nickel 2p can be ascribed to both Ni0 (852.0 eV) and Ni2+ (856.1 eV, Fig. 3d). The ratio of Ni2+ is clearly higher than that of Ni0, which should be owing to the high chemical activity of nickel. Mn is mainly in the form of Mn4+ on the alloy surface owing to its high activity (Fig. 3e). Because Al reside is trapped in the NiCuPtMn-based lattice, metallic Al0 can also be detected from the Al 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. 3f). The detected oxidized species confirm the oxidized surface and the ratio of surface metal and metal oxides of the as-prepared np-AlCuNiPtMn is about 1:1.44. The surface compostion and a detailed ratio of metal/metal oxide for each metal element are shown in Table S1a and b, respectively. The nanoporous multinary alloys with tuned compositions and low Pt loading were studied for ORR. Before the ORR test, the np-HEAs were electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycled about 100 times from 0.05 to 1.25 V (vs. RHE hereinafter) in 0.1 M HClO4 solution to reach a stable state (Fig. S4a and b). The CV cycling would remove the surface oxides and greatly enhance the ECSA of Pt. XPS analysis in Fig. 3 shows that surface Mn, and Al have been removed and a small amount of metallic Cu and Ni can be detected (Table S1a), which probably exist sublayer and are protected by surface Pt. Companied with the surface enrichment of Pt, the surface ratio of metal/metal oxide increases from 1:1.44 to 1:0.37. A detailed ratio of metal/metal oxide for each metal element is shown in Table S1b. Due to the high potential cycling, the Pt XPS peaks also slightly shift to high binding energies. After the activation, the Pt content is only slightly increased as detected by EDS (Table S1a), suggesting the etching only occurs on the nanoligament surface. The Pt mass specific ECSA determined from CO stripping curve is ~108.5 m2 g−1 which is much higher than that of commercial Pt/C (64.5 m2 g−1) and other binary Pt alloys (Fig. S4c–e). The ECSAs from CO stripping is slightly larger than that obtained from Hupd, which is in good agreement with previous study [51,52]. The ORR polarization curves of these catalysts are shown in Fig. 4 a (the fifth element X is non-noble metal) and 4b (the fifth element X is noble metal). For comparison, ternary np-AlCuPt and quaternary np-AlCuNiPt are also studied. It was observed that the ternary np-AlCuPt exhibited clearly enhanced activity when compared with Pt/C. The further addition of Ni, forming quaternary np-AlCuNiPt decreased the catalytic activity, which may be partly due to the decreased Pt content in the quaternary alloy. Interestingly, the addition of the fifth non-noble metals forming quinary np-HEAs all enhances the activity of quaternary np-AlCuNiPt. By carefully examining the effect of the fifth element, it is found that the incorporation of Mn results in the highest activity which is followed by the Co, V, Mo, Ti samples. Explicitly, the np-AlCuNiPtMn exhibits the most positive half-wave potential of ~0.945 V compared with ternary np-AlCuPt (~0.86 V), quaternary np-AlCuNiPt (~0.84 V) and other samples, demonstrating the synergistic effect by incorporating Al, Ni, Cu, Pt, and Mn into one single nanostructured phase. If the fifth element is changed to noble metal (Au, Pd, and Ir), we see that the addition of Au and Pd can enhance the activity of the quaternary np-AlCuNiPt; however, the enhancing effect is not as good as these non-noble elements. The addition of noble metal Ir results in the lowest activity. These phenomena are quite different from previous reports that alloying Pt with Pd or Ir usually enhances the ORR activity [53–56]. For accurate comparison, both Pt ECSA and mass activities are shown in Fig. 4c and the corresponding Tafel plots are shown in Fig. S5. When using the ECSA obtained from CO-stripping curves, the np-AlCuNiPtMn delivers a surface activity of ~5.5 mA cm−2, which is ~16 fold that of Pt/C and clearly among the best activities in literature (Table S2) [57]. The calculated Pt mass activity (~3.5 A mg−1) is also much higher than that of Pt/C (0.22 A mg−1) [58]. From a detailed comparison with the best results in literature (Fig. 4d and Table S2), the high half-wave potential (0.945 V) and the large specific current densities make the np-AlCuNiPtMn sample one of the best ORR catalyst reported. The durability of the np-HEAs was evaluated by a continuous 30,000 CV cycles between 0.6 and 1.0 V with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. After the 30,000 cycles, the AlCuNiPtMn sample shows an even slightly increased diffusion limited current with unchanged half-wave potential, suggesting the high durability (Fig. 4e). Under the same testing condition, the quinary np-AlCuNiPtCo is also quite stable. In a clear contrast, the polarization curve of Pt/C shifts negatively with decreased current density after only 20,000 cycles (Fig. 4e). We also found that the np-AlCuNiPtMn was quite stable for ORR at a constant potential of 0.7 V for 164 h (Fig. 4f). After the long-term test, the (1 1 1) diffraction peak of the np-AlCuNiPtMn shows an obvious shift to the left, indicating the removal of some smaller non-noble elements (Fig. 1b), which is in agreement with EDS and XPS analysis. No phase separation was detected by the XRD analysis. The superior durability of the quinary HEAs may due partly due to the sluggish diffusivity of HEA [34] and the high-entropy stabilization effect. After the electrochemical cycling, the np-AlCuNiPtMn sample was further characterized by STEM (Fig. S6). No obvious nanostructure coarsening or element segregation was observed, which made the multi-component np-HEAs different from normal binary Pt-based alloys [8,59]. The ORR catalytic activities of these electrochemical activated np-HEA catalysts were also studied in alkaline media. As shown in Fig. 4g and h, the np-AlCuNiPtMn sample exhibited the best ORR activity with a highest half-wave potential of 0.954 V, followed by the V, Mo, and Co samples, which is similar to that observed in acidic media. In the alkaline media, however, we observed that the enhancing effect of the noble metals Pd becomes higher, which is different from that observed in acidic media where Au is a better additive. Since the electrochemical activation process would induce a noble metal-rich surface, it is assumed that the Pt-Pd based alloy surface is more active in alkaline media; while in acidic media, the Pt-Au surface is better in the AlCuNiPtX HEA system. To test the performance of the best np-AlCuNiPtMn sample in real device, we assembled a primary Zn-air battery. As shown in Fig. 5 , with a lower Pt loading amount (np-AlCuNiPtMn: ~5.5 μg/cm2; Pt/C: ~15.9 μg/cm2), the np-AlCuNiPtMn-based battery exhibits a higher discharge potential and a larger specific capacity (831 mAh g−1), in comparison to the Pt/C-based battery (770 mAh g−1), demonstrating the high ORR performance of the np-HEA in real battery devices. The influence of the addition of a fifth element X to a quaternary alloy is also investigated by first-principles simulations. Fig. 6 a compares the calculated free energies of reactions in the oxygen reduction processes on CuNiPt and CuNiPtMn surface systems. Under the equilibrium electrode potentials, the formation of OOH* intermediate from O2 (first step) is energetically uphill and becomes the rate-limiting step for ORR on both surfaces. The addition of Mn in the subsurface layers leads to a reduced overpotential, which is consistent with the experiment. Duan et al. [60] found by calculation that subsurface transition metals could weaken the binding of chemical species to the Pt surface layer, resulting in catalytic surfaces with higher ORR activity. In our case, the binding energy is also reduced by the coexisting Cu and Ni in the subsurface layer, causing the activation of O2, O2 → OOH*, to be rate-limiting. By the addition of Mn, the strength of binding is tuned to an optimized value. As OOH* formation is rate-limiting, we further investigate the structures of OOH adsorption on both surface systems at atomic-scale. As shown in Fig. 6b, OOH is stabilized at the fcc hollow site on CuNiPt surface whereas it prefers the bridge site on CuNiPtMn surface (Fig. 6c). These indicate that Mn addition not only leads to even lower level of Pt but also enables modulation of the electronic properties of the catalytic surface that enhances the ORR activity. The influence of Pt overlayer thickness is also investigated by modelling ORR on CuNiPt and CuNiPtMn surfaces with two pure Pt overlayers, as shown in Fig. S7. It is seen that the ORR activity can still be enhanced by the addition of Mn. The enhanced ORR activities of Pt-based alloys have been related to a strain effect and/or ligand effect. In this work, the only changing factor is the fifth element X. Thus, it is assumed that the incorporation of the fifth element Mn combined with Ni, Cu and Al may provide a best electronic modulation for the Pt surface through surface strain and/or ligand effects, resulting in the highest ORR activity. The strain effects may explain why the Mn addition is still effective in surface system with thicker pure Pt overlayer according to the simulations. Recently, machine-learning algorithms and new computational models have been used for rapid search of Pt-based binary or multicomponent catalysts based on the investigations of the OH binding energies on a large number of possible surface adsorption sites [47,61]. The good linear relationship between the bind energies of OOH and OH [62] may also allow the use of OOH binding energy as an alternative descriptor, as we do here, in the future high-throughput prediction of new catalysts. The different enhancing effects of the fifth elements and different element combinations may provide us a guideline to design advanced ORR catalyst based on other metals such as Ag. To see if the guideline obtained from the Pt system is also applicable to the Ag-based alloy system, we designed multi-component Ag-based alloys including Al96Cu1Ni1Ag1Mn1, Al96Cu1Ni1Ag1Mo1, Al96Cu1Ni1Ag1Co1, etc. After the dealloying, single fcc phased multinary np-HEAs were obtained and the five metal elements distribute uniformly across the sample (Figs. S8 and S9). As shown in Fig. S10, the np-AlCuNiAgMn and np-AlCuNiAgMo exhibit the highest ORR activity which is followed by the np-AlCuNiAgCo sample. This trend is basically in agreement with the Pt-based multi-component alloy system, indicating that the discovered designing guideline in the Pt-based HEA system is also applicable to Ag-based multinary alloy system for ORR. Considering that Pt and Ag have different lattice parameters and the Mn incorporation also greatly enhance the ORR activity of Ag, we believe that the ligand effect may also play a key role for the activity enhancement companied with the strain effect. 4 Conclusions In summary, five different metal elements with changed combination/composition have been mixed uniformly into one nanoscale fcc structured phase by a simple alloying-dealloying procedure. The as-prepared HEA with a low Pt content (~20–30 at.%) exhibits bimodal porous structure and ultrafine multicomponent alloy nano-ligaments. By studying and screening the composition effect, a highly ORR active np-AlCuNiPtMn catalyst was found, which exhibited a highest half-wave potential of 0.945 V in acidic media and a ~16 fold mass activity of Pt/C. With huge design space, the np-HEA provides a novel route to find superior catalysts for different chemical reactions.

        "dc:description": "Pt-based alloys have been widely used as high-performance electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). These catalysts contained high Pt contents, typically 60–70 at.% or higher, since further decreasing Pt contents would significantly lower the desired electro-catalytic activity. High-entropy alloys (HEAs) with built-in stability through their low free-energy phases provided a promising route to prepare Pt-based alloy catalysts with less than 50 at.% Pt while maintaining high ORR activity and stability in various environments. In this work, we reported a top-down de-alloying synthetic method to controllably incorporate five immiscible metals in one nanoscale solid phase. By predetermining four elements (Al, Cu, Ni and Pt) and alternating the fifth element including Pd, V, Co, Mn, etc., a series of nanoporous HEAs (np-HEAs) with Pt content of ~20–30 at.% were obtained. Among these quinary alloys, the Al-Cu-Ni-Pt-Mn np-HEA exhibited the best ORR catalytic activity and electrochemical cycling durability, well exceeding the commercial Pt/C catalysts. We expected these nanostructured HEA would offer a new class of alloy catalysts in many electrochemical reactions.",
