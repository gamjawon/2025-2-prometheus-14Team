Fresh catalysts were initially immersed in a furfural (1 wt%) and CrCl3 (0.25 wt%) or Cr(NO3)3 (0.25 wt%) solution and were then loaded into a Harrick Praying Mantis DRIFT cell. The characterization temperature was increased from room temperature to 200 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min under a hydrogen flow (45 mL/min). The background spectrum was collected before the characterization and was deducted during the analysis.

The step of the acid-catalysis might be catalyzed by Lewis acid or Brønsted acid or both, which was investigated in this study by employing Ni/SiC, a catalyst with “clean” surface containing negligible amounts of acidic sites. Lewis acid (nitrate salts and chloride salts) or Brønsted acid (D008, a solid acid resin catalyst) with externally added to the reaction medium. The results showed that both Lewis acid and Brønsted acid could catalyze the conversion of furfural to CPO. The further hydrogenation of furfuryl alcohol (FA) to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol was main side reaction, which could be suppressed more effectively with the Lewis acid like CrCl3. The yield of CPO could be up to ca. 88.1 % with the Ni/SiC-CrCl3 catalytic system. The chelation of CrCl3 with FA stabilized the CC bond in the furan ring and the hydroxyl group, preventing the side reactions while facilitating CPO formation. The synergistic effects between the cation and anion was essential for the conversion of FA to CPO as the varied nitrate salts or chloride salts chelated with furfural, FA or other reaction intermediates in distinct ways, determining distribution of the products. Keywords Furfural hydrogenation Cyclopentanone Lewis acid and Brønsted acid Reaction network Nickel-based catalysts 1 Introduction Furfural is a platform chemical produced from the hydrolysis of hemicellulose and the subsequent dehydration of the C5 sugar substrate [1]. Furfural serves as a versatile feedstock for manufacturing various value-added chemicals such as 2-methylfuran [2], furfuryl alcohol (FA) [3,4], furan [5], tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (TFA) [6], cyclopentanone (CPO) [7–10], etc. Among these derivatives of furfural, the production of CPO has received much attention due to the important application of CPO such as the use in manufacturing medicines, perfume, synthetic rubber, pesticides, etc [11]. Currently, CPO is produced from the ketonisation of adipic acid with the aid of Ba(OH)2 as the catalyst, which is not an environmentally benign or cost-effect process [12]. This is because adipic acid is manufactured from the nonrenewable fossil fuel [13] while Ba(OH)2 is highly corrosive and poisonous. In comparison, it is a viable and sustainable way to produce CPO from the furfural, one of the main products from hydrolysis of the widely distributed and renewable biomass [14]. The formation of CPO from furfural involves several steps, as shown in Scheme 1 . The first step is the hydrogenation of the carbonyl functionality in furfural, producing FA as the initial product. The further dehydration of the hydroxyl group in FA and the opening of the furan ring together with the electrophilic addition reactions produce CPO. The above process involved both the hydrogenation and acid-catalysis steps, which thus requires the co-existence of both the metallic sites for the hydrogenation reactions and the acidic sites for the acid-catalyzed reactions. This raised two questions: (1) is there synergistic effect of the acidic sites and hydrogenation sites important for the consecutive conversion of furfural to CPO? (2) which type of the acidic sites is more effective for catalyzing CPO formation? It has been reported the synergistic effects between the acidic sites and hydrogenation sites in a bi-functional catalyst are essential for the conversion of furfural to the value-added chemicals such as levulinic acid [15]. Nevertheless, how do the acidic sites and hydrogenation sites, i.e. not in the vicinity of each other but in different particles or even different phases, affect the consecutive conversion of furfural to CPO has not been clarified. In addition, the acidic sites on surface of a catalyst could be either Lewis acidic sites or Brønsted acidic sites or both. How do these distinct types of acidic sites affect the acid-catalyzed steps from furfural to CPO needs further clarification? Understanding the above two questions is of importance for synthesis of the efficient catalyst for the selective conversion of furfural to CPO. In order to answer the two questions raised above, SiC was deliberately selected as a carrier to support nickel in this study for the conversion of furfural to CPO. The rationale for selecting SiC as the carrier was that this carrier does not contain oxygen and thus it contains almost negligible to nil Brønsted acidic sites or Lewis acidic sites when compared with silica [16] or alumina [17]. Therefore, it is convenient to add external Brønsted acidic sites or Lewis acidic sites to the reaction medium to investigate their effects on the conversion of furfural or their potential synergistic effects with the hydrogenation sites in the catalysts. Nickel was selected as the hydrogenation sites due to its low cost while reasonable activity when compared with other noble metal-based catalysts for the hydrogenation of furfural [18–22]. The results showed that the balanced distribution of the hydrogenation sites and the acidic sites was crucial to selectively convert furfural to CPO. Both the and the Brønsted acid were effective for catalyzing the production of CPO. However, the Lewis acid such as CrCl3 could chelate with FA. The metal ion and FA could format the chelate which was XFA. These were formed through reactions between the metal ions dissociated from the salts solution and the strongly ionized carboxyl groups yielded by the cleavage of furan rings in an acidic medium, which preventing its further hydrogenation to TFA, creating the possibility for the further conversion of FA to CPO. The Brønsted acid (i.e. D008) did not have such an effect. The nitrate salts or chloride salts, as the Lewis acid catalysts and co-catalyst of Ni/SiC, chelated with furfural and the reaction intermediates in varied ways, substantially modified the distribution of the products. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials A commercially available SiC fiber obtained from MACKLIN Biotechnology Co., Ltd. was used as the carrier of nickel catalysts. Nickel nitride obtained from MACKLIN Biotechnology Co., Ltd. was used as the precursor of metallic nickel in the catalysts. D008 is a solid acidic resin catalyst, which was purchased from MACKLIN Biotechnology Co., Ltd. The other nitrate salts, chloride salts, furfural, FA, TFA, CPO and cyclopentanol were all obtained from MACKLIN Biotechnology Co., Ltd. The materials and chemicals were used as received. 2.2 Catalysts preparation The Ni/SiC catalysts were prepared by using an incipient wetness impregnation method with Ni(NO3)2 as the precursor of nickel. The loading of nickel to the SiC was 15 wt%. Firstly, the aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2 was prepared. After that, the dried SiC were added to the solution. After the impregnation, the samples were dried at 120 °C for 24 h, and then the dried precursor was calcined at an air atmosphere at 600 °C with the temperature ramps was 20 °C/min for 4 h. Finally, the calcined catalysts were reduced at a 50 % H2/Ar atmosphere at 600 °C with the temperature ramps was 20 °C/min for 1 h before the use in the hydrogenation experiments. 2.3 Catalysts characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization of Ni/SiC catalysts was conducted with Rigaku D/MAX-RB instrument with a Cu K ɑ radiation source. The working voltage of the instrument for the measurement was 40 kV, and the working current was 40 mA. The scanning rate was 10°/min and the scanning range was 10 to 80°. Crystalline phases in the samples were identified by comparison with the reference data from International Center for Diffraction Data (ICDD) ﬁles. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) characterization of the calcined catalysts was performed with VDSorb-91i instrument. The sample was heated from room temperature to 850 °C with a heating rate of 15 °C/min and the consumption of hydrogen was recorded with a TCD. NH3 temperature programming desorption (NH3-TPD) were also performed in the VDSorb-91i instrument. The desorption temperature was increased from room temperature to 900 °C with a heating rate of 15 °C/min, and other details for the characterization could be found in our previous work [23]. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Diffused Reflectance Infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) characterization were performed with Nicolet IS 50FT-IR instrument. Details of the FT-IR characterization could be found in our previous work [24]. For the DRIFTS characterization, fresh catalysts immersed in a furfural (1 wt%) and CrCl3 or Cr(NO3)3 (0.25 wt%) solution were loaded into a Harrick Praying Mantis DRIFT cell. The characterization temperature was increased from room temperature to 200 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min. Other details about the DRIFTS characterization could be found in our previous work [25,26]. For the pyridine-DRIFTS experiments, a modified Harrick Praying Mantis DRIFT cell was used. Firstly, the sample and KBr were mixed, grounded, tableted and loaded into the cell. After that, pyridine, carried via a bubbling method with nitrogen gas as the carrier gas, was introduced for the absorption of the samples at room temperature for 30 min. The sample was then swept at a N2 flow (50 mL/min) to remove the physically absorbed pyridine. Finally, the cell was heated from room temperature to 300 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min for desorption of the chemically absorbed pyridine. 2.4 Catalysts test The catalytic performances of the catalysts were investigated in an autoclave reactor. Typically, the catalyst and the reaction substrate were mixed with solvent and then loaded into the reactor vessel with a volume of 10 mL. The catalyst loading was 1 wt% and the amount of the reactant loaded was 0.97 mmol. Next, the reactor was purged initially with H2 for three times and then pressurized with H2 to 3 MPa (at room temperature). After that, the reactor was heated to the setting temperature within 30 min with a stirring rate of 400 rpm and then the reactor was hold for 120 min for the reaction. After the experiment, the liquid products were analysed by using a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 instrument. The instrument was fitted with a wax pillar column with the film thickness of 0.25 μm, internal diameter of 0.25 mm and a pillar length of 30 m. The temperature for the injection port was 250 °C. The column was hold at 50 °C for 3 min and then increased to 250 °C with a 10 °C/min of ramping rate. Acetone was used to dilute the sample for the measurement. Different organics in the samples were separated according to their varied boiling point and polarity. The identification of the organics was achieved by matching their masse with the standard spectra library in NIST 2014. The conversion of the furfural and yield of products was calculated with the equation showing below. Furfural conversion % = Moles of Furfural consumed Moles of Furfural loaded ×100% Products yield (%) = Moles of products Moles of Furfural loaded ×100% 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of the catalysts 3.1.1 Characterization of the porous structure of the catalysts The results of surface area, pore size and pore volume of the SiC and Ni/SiC were collected in Table 1 . The surface area of SiC was only 10.9 m2 g−1. After loading of nickel via an impregnation method, the surface area of SiC and Ni/SiC did not differ too much. Ni/SiC and pure SiC have an average pore size of only 0.1 Å and a pore volume of 0.08 cm2 g−1. Such a small pore size, and pore volume resulted in a small surface area for Ni/SiC. The micropores were so low in diameter that it led to the dispersion of almost of all the nickel species on the surface of the carrier. The potential interaction between nickel and the S/C support was further investigated via the TPR characterization of the calcined Ni/SiC catalyst. 3.1.2 TPR characterization Result for the TPR characterization of the calcined Ni/SiC was shown in Fig. 1 a and the reduction degree was calculated and was shown in Table 1. The Ni/SiC catalyst showed the reduction peaks spanned from 300 to 800 °C with the main reduction peaks at 437 °C and 700 °C, respectively. NiO species exhibit different interaction with the carrier because of the physical or chemical properties of SiC. The reduction peaks at a low reduction temperature (437 °C) might represent the nickel species that had a weak interaction with the SiC carrier. In comparison, the reduction peaks at a higher temperature (700 °C) attributed to the nickel species that had a stronger interaction with the carrier. Another reason for this phenomenon might be due to the mass transfer limitations for hydrogen in reduction of the nickel species with bigger particle size. Interestingly, the reduction degree of Ni/SiC was only 31.9 %, which was relatively lower than that of conventional nickel-based catalysts, such as nickel-based alumina, nickel-based silica, etc [27,28]. There must be some reasons responsible for this. The XRD characterization of the Ni/SiC catalyst was subsequently performed to study the crystal phase composition of the catalyst. 3.1.3 XRD characterization The results of XRD characterization of catalysts after the reduction was summarized in Fig. 1c. The nickel particle sizes were calculated by using Scherrer formula and were summarized in the Table 1. In the reduced catalysts, the diffraction peaks of the metallic nickel species were observed at 2θ = 44.5°, 51.8°, and 71.5° (card number: PDF # 01–1258). The nickel particle size calculated was 31.9 nm, which was relatively bigger than that in Ni/Al2O3 or Ni/SiO2 [29–31]. The bigger particle size of the metallic nickel was mainly due to the sintering of nickel species. This was indicated that SiC is a carrier with mainly micropores, which leading to the poor dispersion of the nickel species on surface of the catalysts. On the other hand, the interaction between the nickel species and carrier was not strong enough to anchor the nickel species. During the calcination or reduction process, the nickel species sintered easily. In addition, the diffraction peak of Ni3Si was also observed in the XRD pattern at 2θ = 21.8°, 34.5°, and 56.1° (card number: PDF # 03–4131). The Fig. 1b showed that Ni3Si was formed in the process of the calcination. Ni3Si, as an intermetallic compound, and is difficult to be reduced. The mechanism for the formation of this intermetallic compound has not been understood yet. 3.1.4 Characterization of the acidic sites The distribution of the acidic sites on surface of the catalysts was characterized with pyridine DIRFTS and NH3-TPD techniques. The results of the pyridine-DRIFTS were summarized in Fig. 1e and f. Over the Ni/SiC catalyst, the characteristic absorption of both Lewis acidic sites and Brønsted acidic sites could not be identified. For the Ni/SBA-15 reported in literature [32,33], even at the heating temperature of 150 °C, pyridine still had strong absorption of both the Lewis acidic sites and the Brønsted acidic sites. The Lewis acidic sites and the Brønsted acidic sites, if any, could not be clearly identified in the Ni/SiC. The results of NH3-TPD reached the similar conclusion (Fig. 1d). It could be observed that the total acidic sites on surface of the Ni/SiC were very little and the total acidity of Ni/SiC calculated was very small. The negligible amounts of acidic sites in Ni/SiC means that the surface of the catalyst was relatively \"clean\". Correspondingly, the influence of the intrinsic acidic sites on surface of the catalysts on the catalytic reaction was small, which is beneficial for investigating the impacts of the externally added Lewis acidic sites and the Brønsted acidic sites on the catalytic conversion of furfural to CPO. 3.2 Catalytic performance Results for the catalytic performance of Ni/SiC catalyst with the absence/presence of co-catalysts in the hydrogenation of furfural at 120 °C were summarized in Table 2 . At 120 °C, the Ni/SiC catalyst was not very active. The conversion of furfural was only 58.1 % and FA was the major product (Entry 1, Table 2). With the co-existence of D008 in the reaction medium, the conversion of furfural was improved substantially (Entry 2, Table 2). Most importantly, the distribution of the main products changed. Instead of FA, CPO was formed as the major product. D008 is a solid acidic resin catalyst bearing the –SO3H functionality, which is a typical Brønsted acid. The experimental phenomena above indicated that the Brønsted acid like D008 could clearly promote CPO formation via a dehydration of FA, the opening of the furan ring and the subsequent electrophilic addition reaction. The promotion of D008 for the conversion of FA to CPO also facilitated the further hydrogenation of furfural to FA. There existed a reaction equilibrium between furfural and FA. The presence of the Brønsted acid broke the reaction equilibrium and facilitated both the hydrogenation of furfural to FA and the further subsequent conversion of FA to CPO. The nitrate salts as the co-catalyst also remarkably impacted the conversion of furfural and the distribution of the products. In the co-existence of La(NO3)3 in the reaction medium, the conversion of furfural was greatly improved (Entry 3, Table 2). Although there was no CPO formed, the yield of TFA reached 62.1 %. The presence of La(NO3)3, further promoted the hydrogenation of FA to TFA. The aqueous solution of La(NO3)3 is not acidic, and thus FA was not converted to CPO. Nevertheless, La(NO3)3 must chelate with either FA and/or furfural, facilitating their further conversion to TFA. The presence of Cr(NO3)3 also promoted the conversion of FA to TFA, but did not improve the conversion of furfural (Entry 4, Table 2). The distinct cations in the reaction medium chelated with the furfural, FA or the reaction intermediates in distinct ways. This was further demonstrated with presence of Fe(NO3)3 or in the reaction medium. Zr(NO3)3 as the co-catalyst even led to the reduced conversion of furfural (Entry 5 and 6, Table 2). LaCl3 in the reaction medium could promote the conversion of FA to CPO (Entry 8, Table 2), while La(NO3)3 could not. Cl− clearly showed catalytic effects for the conversion of FA to CPO. Nevertheless, with FeCl3 or ZrCl3 as the co-catalyst, furfural even could not be converted (Entry 7 and 9, Table 2). Hence, the synergistic effects between the cation and anion must exist. With CrCl3 as the co-catalyst of Ni/SiC in the reaction medium, the conversion of furfural greatly improved and the yields of CPO was even comparable to that with D008 as the catalyst (Entry 10, Table 2). CrCl3 is a typical Lewis acid catalyst, which could catalyze the isomerization of glucose to fructose. The results herein demonstrated that both the Lewis acid catalyst (CrCl3) and the Brønsted acid catalyst (D008) could catalyze the conversion of furfural to CPO, or more exactly, the further conversion of FA to CPO via dehydration, ring opening reactions, etc. Both the Lewis acidic sites and Brønsted acidic sites were not distributed on Ni/SiC catalyst, indicating that the synergistic effects of hydrogenation sites and acid sites in the same bi-functional catalyst was not the pre-requisite for the effective conversion of furfural to CPO. At the reaction temperature of 140 °C, the catalytic activity of Ni/SiC of for hydrogenation of furfural increased slightly (Table 3 ). FA remained the major product. In overall, the effects of the nitrate salts and the chloride salts on the conversion of furfural were similar to that at 120 °C (Table 2). Cr(NO3)3 and CrCl3 as well as LaCl3 and La(NO3)3 behaved quite differently for catalyzing the conversion of furfural to CPO. FeCl3 and ZrCl3 negatively impacted the conversion of furfural. When the reaction temperature reached 160 °C, the catalytic activity of Ni/SiC catalyst was further improved (Table 4 ). Moreover, there was some CPO produced. Under the subcritical conditions, water itself acts as both acid and base catalyst [34,35]. With D008 in the reaction medium, the yield of CPO was also improved at the higher reaction temperature. La(NO3)3 as the co-catalyst, similar to that at 120 or 140 °C, facilitated the conversion of FA to TFA (Entry 3, Table 4). The formation of TFA as the main product eliminated the chance for the formation of CPO as FA is the precursor of CPO [36]. The salts thus could be used to regulate the distribution of the products in hydrogenation of furfural. Fe(NO3)3 or Zn(NO3)2 probably strongly chelate with FA, suppressing its further hydrogenation to TFA, especially for Fe(NO3)2 (Entry 5, Table 4). Again, with FeCl3, or ZrCl4 as the co-catalyst, the conversion of furfural was small (Entry 7 and 9, Table 4). These two chlorate salts probably strongly chelated with furfural, preventing its further conversion. CrCl3 as the co-catalyst could effectively catalyze the conversion of FA to CPO, while suppressed the further hydrogenation of FA to TFA. The yield of CPO reached ca. 88.1 %, which was higher than that with D008 as the co-catalyst (ca. 75.4 %). D008 as Brønsted acid was not that effective to suppress the further hydrogenation of FA to TFA, leading to the relatively lower yield of CPO. The further increase of the reaction temperature to 180 °C did not further enhance the formation of CPO over the Ni/SiC-D008 or Ni/SiC-CrCl3 catalytic system (Table 5 ). This was because the higher reaction temperature also promoted the further hydrogenation of FA to TFA, a competitive product competing the formation of CPO. The Ni/SiC-CrCl3 catalytic system was very effective for the conversion of furfural to CPO. The loading of CrCl3 might also affect the conversion of furfural to CPO, which was further investigated and the results was summarized in Table 2 and Fig. 2 . The results indicated that the conversion of furfural increased with the increasing loading of CrCl3 and meanwhile the production of CPO also increased. In addition, with the increase of CrCl3 loading, the formation of TFA was also suppressed, which was the pre-requisite for the further conversion of FA to CPO. Thus, CrCl3 played dual roles for suppressing the formation of TFA and the for catalyzing the further conversion of FA to CPO. Nevertheless, too much CrCl3 in the reaction medium chelate with furfural, interfering with the conversion of furfural via the hydrogenation reaction. The hydrogenation sites and the acidic sites have to be balanced to achieve the effective conversion of furfural to CPO. The recycle tests of the Ni/SiC-CrCl3 system indicated that the catalyst system showed a good recyclability, without remarkable loss of catalytic activities for five cycles, as shown in Fig. 3 . The spent Ni/SiC catalyst was characterized with XRD and FT-IR (Fig. 4 a and b). The results showed that after the catalytic experiments, the crystal phase as well as absorption patterns in the FT-IR characterization were similar to the fresh catalyst, indicating the stable structure of the catalyst. The potential chelation of the salts with furfural was further investigated. 3.3 FT-TR characterization The different nitrates and chlorides were mixed with 1 wt% furfural in water and were characterized with FT-IR. Firstly, a small amount of nitrate or chloride salt is mixed with furfural and dissolved in water to prepare a furfural aqueous solution with a 1 wt%. After that, a small amount of aqueous solution was added dropwise to potassium bromide, and after grinding sufficiently, the potassium bromide which added to the solution was tableted and get a FT-IR characterization. The results were shown in Fig. 5 . The CO and COC in furfural showed a blue shift in the FT-IR spectra of the mixture of furfural and the chlorinated salts. This indicated that chloride ions can make CO and COC more unstable. CC l was found in the infrared spectra with the chlorinated salt (Fig. 5b). On the other hand, the CC in the furfural showed a blue shift in the FT-IR spectra of the mixture of furfural and the nitrate salts. This indicated that the nitrate ions can make CC more unstable (Fig. 5c). It is possible that chloride ions interact with the furan ring and further to weaken CO and COC . The furan ring in the furfural molecule is more susceptible to ring opening with the presence of chloride ions. In comparison, the introduced nitrate salt did not cause the blue shift of CO and COC in the FT-IR spectrum of furfural water solution, indicating that nitrates could not weaken CO and COC . The impacts of chloride and nitrate ions on CO and COC were different. Chloride ions might explain the promotional effects of chloride salts on the formation of cyclopentanone, which prevented the further hydrogenation of FA to TFA, which as shown in Table 4. In order to investigated the impact of Cl− and NO3 − in the furfural system. The DFT was performed in order to confirm the above inference. 3.4 DRIFTS characterization A DRIFTS of the furfural hydrogenation reaction was performed in order to further study the role of nitrates and chlorides in the reaction. The result is shown in Fig. 6 . As the temperature increased, the hydroxyl group showed a red shifted on the Ni/SiC + CrCl3 (Fig. 6a’). While, the hydroxyl group showed a blue shifted on the Ni/SiC + Ni(NO3)2 (Fig. 6b). This indicates that the hydroxyl group has a strong chemisorption effect on Ni/SiC at high temperature when the existed of CrCl3 [37,38]. On the other hand, the hydroxyl group has almost no chemisorption for Ni/SiC at higher temperatures when the existed of Cr(NO3)3. After FA is formed by hydrogenation of furfural, the hydroxyl group of FA is adsorbed on the surface of Ni/SiC catalyst when the existed of CrCl3 and further form to cyclopentanone. Therefore, FA is hardly found in the products when the existed of CrCl3. While, some FA will leave the catalyst surface in the presence of Cr(NO3)3 when the temperature rises. The hydrogenation reaction of FA would be arrested. C–H in the Aldehyde also shown the difference between the Ni/SiC + CrCl3 and Ni/SiC + Ni(NO3)2. Ni/SiC + CrCl3 shown a better chemical adsorption for C–H (Aldehyde). Therefore, furfural shown a better conversion via the Ni/SiC + CrCl3. As the temperature increased, the furfural conversed to other compounds such as CPO with the disappear of CH(Aldehyde). 4 Conclusions In summary, the results indicated that the Ni/SiC catalyst, which contained the negligible amount of Lewis acidic sites and the Brønsted acidic sites, was only able to catalyze the hydrogenation of furfural to FA. The presence of the externally added Brønsted acid catalyst or Lewis acid catalyst substantially regulated the conversion routes of furfural. The co-existence of the Brønsted acid like D008 promoted CPO formation via the dehydration of FA, the opening of the furan ring and the subsequent electrophilic addition reaction. Such promotional effect also facilitated the up-stream hydrogenation of furfural to FA, enhancing conversion of furfural. The addition of the nitrate salts such as La(NO3)3, however, guided the further conversion of FA to TFA via the full hydrogenation of the furan ring. The formation of TFA eliminated the chance for the conversion of furfural to CPO. The varied ways of chelation of the salts with FA or furfural significantly affected distribution of the products. Fe(NO3)3 and Zn(NO3)2, in converse, chelated strongly with FA, preventing its further hydrogenation to TFA. The chelation of FeCl3 or ZrCl3 with furfural, however, prevented furfural from being hydrogenated. The synergistic effects between the cation and anion was essential for the conversion of FA to CPO. LaCl3 as the co-catalyst promoted the conversion of FA to CPO, while La(NO3)3 promoted the hydrogenation of FA to TFA. The presence of Cr(NO3)3 also catalyzed the further hydrogenation of FA to TFA, while the use of CrCl3 as the co-catalyst could achieve the selective conversion of furfural to CPO with the yield up to ca. 88.1 %. CrCl3 played dual roles for (1) suppressing the furfural hydrogenation of FA to TFA and for (2) catalyzing subsequent conversion of FA to CPO. However, too much CrCl3 in the reaction medium strongly chelated with furfural, interfering with the hydrogenation of furfural. Balanced distribution of the hydrogenation sites and the acidic sites was of importance for achieving effective conversion of furfural to CPO. The characterization showed that the chelation with CrCl3 stabilized the CC bond in FA, preventing its further hydrogenation. The in-situ DRIFTS characterization of furfural hydrogenation showed that the hydroxyl group of FA could be strongly adsorbed on the surface of Ni/SiC catalyst with the aid of CrCl3, facilitating its further conversion to CPO. Both the Lewis acid and the Brønsted acid could catalyze the conversion of furfural to CPO. Nevertheless, the nitrate salts or chloride salts investigated could not only generate the Lewis acidic sites that were essential for CPO formation, which could also chelate with furfural, FA or other reaction intermediates in distinct ways, regulating the distribution of the products. Particular attention should be paid on this aspect. CRediT authorship contribution statement Zhenjie Yu: Investigation, Data curation, Writing - original draft, Validation, Visualization.

        "dc:description": "The conversion of furfural to cyclopentanone (CPO) involves not only hydrogenation but also acid-catalysis reactions. The step of the acid-catalysis might be catalyzed by Lewis acid or Brønsted acid or both, which was investigated in this study by employing Ni/SiC, a catalyst with “clean” surface containing negligible amounts of acidic sites. Lewis acid (nitrate salts and chloride salts) or Brønsted acid (D008, a solid acid resin catalyst) with externally added to the reaction medium. The results showed that both Lewis acid and Brønsted acid could catalyze the conversion of furfural to CPO. The further hydrogenation of furfuryl alcohol (FA) to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol was main side reaction, which could be suppressed more effectively with the Lewis acid like CrCl3. The yield of CPO could be up to ca. 88.1 % with the Ni/SiC-CrCl3 catalytic system. The chelation of CrCl3 with FA stabilized the CC bond in the furan ring and the hydroxyl group, preventing the side reactions while facilitating CPO formation. The synergistic effects between the cation and anion was essential for the conversion of FA to CPO as the varied nitrate salts or chloride salts chelated with furfural, FA or other reaction intermediates in distinct ways, determining distribution of the products.",
