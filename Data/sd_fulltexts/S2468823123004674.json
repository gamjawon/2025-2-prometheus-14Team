A non-conducting mesoporous silica support (SBA-16) with active supported electroactive iridium and cobalt was synthesized by a simple hydrothermal and impregnation method. The synthesized catalysts were represented as 5% IrO2/SBA-16, 10% IrO2/SBA-16, and 5% Co3O4 / 10% IrO2, respectively. All catalysts were characterized by XRD, BET-Surface area, XPS, EDAX, and HR-TEM techniques to study their structural, morphological, chemical and micro structural properties. Small-angle XRD confirmed the mesoporous nature of the material formation, showing major faces at (100), (110), (200), and (220). High-angle XRD confirmed the formation of Co3O4 and IrO2 phase on the catalyst surface. Nitrogen sorption isotherm showed a ordered material with surface areas of the decreasing order of 5% IrO2/SBA-16, 10% IrO2/SBA-16, and 5% Co3O4/10% IrO2/SBA-16, respectively. EDAX analysis confirmed the presence of Ir and Co levels in the bimetallic catalysts. The oxidation state of Ir +4 and Co3+ were confirmed by XPS analysis. HR-TEM images showed that this material was highly porous and contained active metal particles dispersed throughout the surface. These metal particles play an important role in decreasing lower overpotential and current densities. In particular, the 5% Co3O4 /10% IrO2/SBA-16 showed a lower overpotential of 380 mV at a current density of 10 mA. Compared to the activities of all the catalysts, 5% Co3O4 /10% IrO2/SBA-16 showed higher activity due to the broad distribution of active sites with frequent electron transfers. Furthermore, during chronopotentiometry testing, a stable potential was maintained for over 12 hours at a constant current density of 10 mA.

Over the next decades, renewable energy produced from carbon-neutral sources is seen as a strategy that can overcome all environmental challenges [1]. Electrochemical water electrolysis (EWE) is recognized as an essential method for the production of renewable hydrogen and oxygen for human consumption and fuel for a different application [2]. Electrochemical water electrolysis is performed through two processes: hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. OER is a four-electron-proton bonding process that forms O–O bond that can be initiated by a low overpotential catalyst. Both of these half-cell reactions are irreversible and restrained by charge transfer [3]. This is catalyzed by an efficient electrocatalyst with the key properties of providing low onset overpotential and low overpotential at standard current densities. In most cases, RuO2 and IrO2 are the two important metal oxides that catalyze the OER reaction [3]. Nevertheless, when compared to the easy-to-evolve hydrogen evolution (HER) reaction, the main challenge that arises in the water electrolysis process is the anodic oxygen evolution reaction, which suffers from slow kinetics and excessive overpotential [2]. Therefore, the storage of renewable hydrogen fuels is vulnerable by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the development of efficient OER catalysts is essential for the development of H2 storage technologies. Furthermore, the development of high-performance heterogeneous electrocatalysts with cost-effectiveness is a great challenge in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In particular, the catalyst containing high active sites with low overpotential, high reaction kinetics, and high durability are the superior properties of OER catalysts [4,5]. Therefore, the development of efficient catalyst with high performance in water oxidation is an increasing interest in the field of research. Moreover, the reaction medium is also believed to play an important role in achieving high catalytic activity. Due to the material instability in acidic media, higher catalytic activity is observed in basic media than in acidic media [6]. However, there were few materials that showed activity in acidic media and showed high electrocatalytic activity, but their stability is questionable [7–9]. It is known that IrO2 and RuO2 are considered good anode materials for OER. Ru is less stable at high oxidation potentials, but provides high performances, and IrO2 is more stable [10]. However, due to the high cost and the lack of regenerative ability of the material, it has not been put to practical use. Based on these factors, the introduction of high surface area mesoporous SBA-16 silica support may play an important role in improving the active site distribution and providing more active sites for adsorption of water molecules. Furthermore, the inclusion of active metal ions into the high surface area support is an alternative method to the preparation of inexpensive modified electrodes in the OER reaction. These modified electrode materials based on mesoporous supports were used for catalytic purposes [11–13]. Since their discovery, these materials are being used in various research fields such as catalysis, sensing, energy storage, and biomedicals [12]. Mesoporous materials are porous materials with regular and tuneable pore sizes from 2 to 50 nm [12]. The use of mesoporous inert silica has been limited by its non-conductivity in electrode reactions. Similarly, carbon supports are also corroded in OER reaction at high anodic potentials when used as electrocatalysts in metal-air batteries [3]. Apart from this drawback, these materials can provide the host active iridium metal oxide with excellent surface area and stability, which is advantages over using bulk iridium oxide to obtain high OER activity. In this study, SBA-16 mesoporous silica was used as a high surface area support and therefore one of the most attractive materials in the family of mesoporous silica to be used as catalytic support because of its large surface area and 3-D cubic structure with spherical pores connected via smaller pore opening. It also has a thick wall and its hydrothermally stable. Thus, SBA-16 play an important role in the preparation of working electrode for the electrochemical OER reaction because it offers maximum active sites and stabilize to hold high-cost IrO2 while also minimizing particle size and enhances electron transfer by the metal support interaction [12,14]. In recent years, the noble metal-based catalyst has a significant interest in OER activity, particularly iridium oxide shows high catalytic activity due to its low overpotential [15,16]. Moreover, many researchers have reported different IrO2-supported catalysts for OER reactions in order to increase efficiency [15–20]. However, the evolution per oxygen molecule required the transfer of 4 electrons. Obviously, OER is a more complicated reaction because its slow kinetics require high energy to break the activation barrier, which is the reason for the inefficiencies of the water electrolysis cell. Therefore, there are plenty of opportunity for efficiency improvement through catalyst development in the OER. The transition metals Co, Fe and Ni were extensively studied as electro catalysts and these materials were high active in acidic media and therefore comparable with noble metal oxides. However, comparison with acidic environment, use of transition metals in alkaline medium, reduces entire cost of the devices [21]. Therefore, on the basis of these considerations, transition metal Co was incorporated into the noble metal Ir and creates a bimetallic active site to improve the electron transfer. A limited report exists on IrO2-supported silica catalyst and further to the best of our knowledge no published results investigated the electrochemical properties of Co3O4/IrO2 supported SBA-16 material. In this study, we used a nonconductive high surface area SBA-16 support with iridium and cobalt nanoparticles embedded on it, which demonstrated high electron conductivity. 5% IrO2/SBA-16, 10% IrO2/SBA-16, and 5% Co3O4 / 10% IrO2/ SBA-16 mono and bimetal-based cobalt and iridium supported catalyst were prepared via hydrothermal and impregnation method. These materials were characterized by various physicochemical techniques and evaluated their electrochemical properties. Furthermore, the conducting supports were eliminated in this work because the silica support was not affecting the catalytic performance [11]. According to TEM results, the active species were highly abundant on the external surface without aggregation, resulting in a high catalytic activity, and further, the combination of two metals in the catalyst has shown high activity than the single site IrO2 catalyst. Furthermore, the OER activity results of mono metallic IrO2 suggest that the increase in activity is due to the addition of cobalt oxide to the iridium oxide, which has more active sites for interelectrode electron transport. It further reduces the kinetic barrier by providing an interface and exposing the active site to reactive intermediates. In addition, most of the active particles of this bimetallic catalyst are 10-20 nm in size and are all involved in the electrocatalytic activity. Therefore, it may all play an important role in the OER reaction. The electrocatalytic properties of mesoporous silica, based on IrO2 and Co3O4 were investigated using cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry, and EIS. 2 Experimental 2.1 Chemicals Tetra-ethyl-ortho-silicate (TEOS, 99% pure), Pluronic F127 (EO106 PO70 EO106), and n-Butanol were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. SRL chemicals Ltd supplied 35% hydrochloric acid (HCl). Aldrich chemicals Ltd supplied the iridium trichloride (IrCl3 nH2O), and Cobalt chloride (CoCl3 n H2O). During the experiment, Millipore distilled water was used. All chemicals were utilized in their natural state, with no further purification. 2.2 Preparation of mesoporous SBA-16 support The hydrothermal approach was employed to prepare mesoporous SBA-16 silica, according to prior reports [22]. Pluronic F127 was employed as the template molecule while TEOS was used as the silicon source. In a typical procedure, 3.0 g of F127, 144 mL of distilled water, and 13.9 mL of Con. HCl were stirred in a polypropylene bottle at room temperature with a magnetic stirrer for one hour, and the entire mixture appeared as a clear solution that ensured the complete dissolution of template molecule. 11.0 mL of n-butanol was added to the mixture as a co-solvent, and stirring was continued for roughly 0.5 h. The solution was then mixed with 15.3 mL of TEOS, and the mixture was stirred well for 24 h at 40 °C. The mixture was transferred to a 250 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and placed in a hot air oven at 100 °C for 24 hours. The produced silica material was filtered hot in a Buckner funnel using a vacuum pump after hydrothermal treatment. The material was dried in an air oven at 100 °C for 12 hours before being calcined at 540 °C for 6 hours. The resulting material was designated as mesoporous siliceous SBA-16. 2.3 Preparation of metal oxide-supported catalysts Wet-impregnation method was used to produce active iridium and cobalt supported mesoporous catalysts with 5% IrO2/SBA-16, 10% IrO2/SBA-16, and 5% Co3O4/10% IrO2/SBA-16 [23]. In general, 1g of silica support was placed in a 100 mL round bottom flask, followed by 30 mL of distilled water was added and stirred at room temperature. The appropriate percentages of cobalt and iridium salts were added separately into 10 mL of distilled water, and the salt solution was gently mixed into the aforementioned slurry. Stirring continued at room temperature for 5 hours, and the solution was maintained in a hot air oven at 100 °C for 12 hours. The solvent evaporated material was mortared and calcined for 6 hours at 400 °C. 2.4 Catalyst characterization The mesoporous nature of the synthesized catalyst and the formation of metal oxide phases was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis using a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation =1.5418Å and a nickel filter. The diffraction data for low angle XRD 2θ=0.5-5o and high angle XRD 2θ=10-80o were collected. The actual metal loading in the prepared catalysts was measured using an ICP-OES PerkinElmer Optima 5300 DV instrument. N2 sorption analysis was used to measure the surface area and pore size of the materials using Micromeritics ASAP 2010. The materials were degassed at 200 °C with pressure about 1.33×10−2 Pa. The surface area, pore size, pore volume of all the samples were calculated from the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. Pore size distribution was measured by Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. HR-TEM with EDAX analysis was carried out on a Techni G 200 at 200 kV. XPS analysis was performed using Thermos ESCALA250i X-ray photo electron spectrometer. 2.5 Electrochemical measurements 1.0 mg of electrocatalyst and 10 µL of Nafion solution were thoroughly sonicated in 200 µL of water and isopropanol (3:1, v/v) until a homogeneous ink was formed. 3 µL of the catalyst ink was dropped onto the surface of glassy carbon (GC) electrodes and allowed to dry in air. The electrocatalytic performances of the catalysts were evaluated in a standard three-electrode electrochemical cell with the catalyst loaded GC electrode as the working electrode, an Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) as the reference electrode, and a Pt wire as the counter electrode. All measurements were performed at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in 1 M KOH solutions (pH = 14). 3 Result and discussion 3.1 XRD Fig. 1 (a) represented low angle XRD spectrum of Si-SBA-16, 5% IrO2 / SBA-16, 10% IrO2 / SBA-16 and 5% Co3O4 / 10% IrO2 / SBA-16 catalysts. The low angle XRD spectrum of Si-SBA-16 shows peak at 2θ = 0.85 corresponding to the major plane 110 of mesoporous cubic natured material with cage-type mesopores (Im3m symmetry) [24]. Furthermore, the succeeding catalysts, namely 5% IrO2, 10% IrO2, and 5% Co3O4 / 10% IrO2 shows strong diffraction peak at 2θ = 0.94o, 0.92o, 0.84o respectively. A small peak shift observed at higher 2θ for monometallic catalyst. However, a very little change was observed in the 5% Co3O4 / 10% IrO2 / SBA-16 bimetallic catalyst. The peak shifting and the intensity reduction in both mono and bimetal catalysts are due to a small change in the texture by the interaction of support with metal species. In the case of bimetallic catalyst, the probability of metal support interaction is dominant over mono metal catalyst. However, the surface area and pore volume of bimetal catalyst was decreased. It may be due to a small metal particle were occupied in the pores and it could not alter the properties of catalysts. Furthermore, it was related to a unit cell value calculated from the 110-lattice plane and it was represented in the Table 1 . Fig. 1(b) represented high angle XRD spectrum of 5% IrO2 / SBA-16, 10% IrO2 / SBA-16 and 5% Co3O4 / 10% IrO2 / SBA-16 respectively. The broad peak around 2θ = 22o was corresponds to the amorphous phase silica and these broad peaks were existence in all the metal supported catalysts [23]. The 5% IrO2 / SBA-16 catalyst exhibits diffraction peaks at 2θ = 27.9o, 34.9o, 40.0o, 54.0o, and 65.7o, indicating iridium oxide identification, with the major peak observed at 2θ = 34.9° corresponding to (101) plan (JCPDS:15-0807) [25]. Also, the 10% IrO2 / SBA-16 catalyst exhibits diffraction angle values 2θ = 27.5o, 34.7o, 39.6o, 53.5o, and 65.6o, respectively, and these values were very small difference when compared to the 5% IrO2 catalyst towards lower 2θ shift, which could be attributed to a high concentration of IrO2 and may be a small amount of Ir incorporated in the framework silica [26]. Furthermore, the 5% Co3O4 / 10% IrO2 / SBA-16 bimetal catalyst exhibits IrO2 phase at 2θ = 27.5o, 34.5o, 39.2o, 53.6o, and 65.4o, respectively. The cobalt oxide phase was observed at 2θ = 36.8o, 44.7o, and 59.3o, respectively, and the peak intensity of Co3O4 was observed maximum at 2θ = 36.8o, with their corresponding plan value indexed as (311) (JCPDS:15-0807) [27]. The average metal oxide crystallite size was calculated using the Scherrer equation based on the (101) and (311) plan of the catalysts, as shown in Table 1. Furthermore, the average particle size calculated from XRD and HR-TEM appeared to be comparable. 3.2 Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm Fig. 2 (a) and (b) represents Nitrogen sorption isotherm and pore size distribution of Si-SBA-16, 5% IrO2 / SBA-16, 10% IrO2 / SBA-16 and 5% Co3O4 / 10% IrO2 / SBA-16 catalysts. According to IUPAC classification all the catalysts was formed type IV isotherm with H2 hysteresis loops [28]. The BJH pore size distribution curves indicates the formation of well-ordered materials. The textural properties of the catalysts were represented in Table 1. The surface area of SBA-16 shows maximum of 838 m2/g and the surface area, pore size was gradually decreased as in the prepared catalysts. However, the catalysts exhibited bimodal pore system that have both micropore and mesopores. Furthermore, the decreases of surface area and pore size may be due to a small amount of metal oxide species located on the pores of catalyst [29]. Besides, the changes in the textural nature of catalyst as compared with pure support does not affect the catalytic properties as it was confirmed by the HR-TEM images and low angle XRD. 3.3 XPS Fig. 3 (a), (b), and (c) show XPS results for catalysts with 5% IrO2 / SBA-16, 10% IrO2 / SBA-16 and 5% Co3O4 / 10% IrO2 / SBA-16. The spectrum deconvolution of Ir 4f and Co 2p was performed. According to the literature, metallic Ir has binding energies of 60-61 eV and this metallic iridium does not exist in the prepared catalyst [29]. However, all spin states of Ir in the prepared catalyst were found at higher binding energies, indicating Ir existence solely in oxide form. Furthermore, the pure IrO2 oxide exhibits two spin states of Ir 4f7/2 and 4f5/2, which correspond to Ir4+, at 61.8 eV and 64.8 eV, respectively [30]. Meanwhile, when compared to the pure IrO2 catalyst, the 5% IrO2 / SBA-16 catalyst shows high binding energy values at Ir 4f7/2 62.8 eV and Ir 4f5/2 65.4 eV respectively, which suggested the 4+ / 3+ oxidation states existed in the 5% IrO2 / SBA-16 catalyst [31]. Also, the binding energy values appeared in the 10% IrO2 / SBA-16 catalyst was slightly lesser than 5% IrO2 SBA-16 catalyst, and a very little lower shift observed at Ir 4f7/2 62.2 eV and 4f5/2 65.0 eV. It may be due to the high content of iridium oxide in the catalyst. Moreover, the lower shift confirmed that the most of the iridium species exist in +4 oxidation state in the 10% IrO2 / SBA-16 catalyst. However, the 5% Co3O4 / 10% IrO2 / SBA-16 bimetallic catalyst shows that the iridium spin states Ir 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 at 62.4 eV and 65.3 eV. These values were co-existed with the 5% IrO2 and 10% IrO2 mono metallic catalyst and further it confirms that the iridium exist in +4 oxidation states. The binding energy difference between the mono and bi-metallic catalyst may be due to metal-support and metal-metal interaction and further the bimetallic interaction could enhance the OER activity. Cobalt Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 spin states were indexed at 781.2 eV and 796.5 eV, respectively, as shown in the Co 2p deconvoluted spectra Fig. 3(c). A satellite peak of Co 2p1/2 was also observed at 804.8 eV and further the cobalt +3 oxidation levels were assigned to these binding energy values [32]. OER activity was comparable with the XPS results and it was suggested that the bimetallic IrO2/Co3O4 catalyst has high activity than the other catalyst in the work. The possible reasons were deduced from the electronic structural variation in the catalysts and it was observed from the corresponding binding energy variation of Ir 4f7/2 towards negative shift between the catalyst. This is due to the SiO2 surface oxygen interaction with IrO2, which has significant impact on the electronic shift as a result the probable amount of oxidation states varied and resulted in OER activity variation [33]. In general, the positive electronic shift in the catalyst could decrease the electron density around the secondary metal and could promote the reaction faster [33]. However, in contrast to the 5% IrO2 catalyst with its Ir 4f7/2 high binding energy value, illustrates that the electron density increased around the Ir and it showed negative effect on the OER activity due to the high electron density effectively repellent between metal and support, causing less metal-support interaction. However, on compared to 5% IrO2 catalyst, a diverse factor was observed in 10% IrO2 catalyst, where the Ir 4f7/2 shows negative electronic shift around 0.63 eV and it indicates the negative charge decreases around the Ir resulting the high OER activity was observed due to the better metal-support interactions. Moreover, the presence of 5% Co3O4 in the bimetallic catalyst has significant impact on the OER activity and the negative electronic shift of Ir 4f7/2 was observed around 0.39 eV and further the cobalt spin states observed at relatively higher binding energy values and thus can donate the electrons, which boost the OER activity. 3.4 HR-TEM Fig. 4 (a), (b), (c) represents HR-TEM images with EDAX spectrum of 5% IrO2 / SBA-16, 10% IrO2 / SBA-16, 5% Co3O4 / 10% IrO2 / SBA-16 catalysts. The image of 5% IrO2 / SBA-16 catalyst shows a very clear pores with lattice springers and the majority of the surface was occupied by the needle like particles of iridium oxides. 10% IrO2 / SBA-16 catalyst shows high proportion of iridium oxide uniformly dispersed on the entire surface and may be responsible for the high catalytic activity as compared with 5% IrO2 catalyst. In that case of 5% Co3O4 / 10% IrO2 / SBA-16 catalyst, a two different spot was observed i.e., needle and circle. The needle spots were situated in the surface was higher than the circle spots, and it confirms that most of the particles were iridium. The entire spots were dispersed homogeneously in the surface and further its particle size distribution was measured. Most of the particles appeared size below 25 nm and these results were in well agreement with the particle size calculated from the high angle XRD. Furthermore, a minor particle was located in the insides of the pores as it was seen in the image. EDAX spectrum of 5% Co3O4 / 10% IrO2 / SBA-16 catalyst confirms the presence of cobalt and iridium oxide. 3.5 The electrocatalytic reaction studies In acidic and basic medium, the OER mechanism involves four electron/proton transfer steps, which was widely accepted using metal oxide catalyst. In acidic medium H2O are oxidized to form H+ + e− pairs and O2 molecules. However, in the alkaline conditions, OH− groups were oxidized to form H2O and O2 with concurrent release of e− [34]. The detailed reaction mechanism was shown below [35,36]. ∗ + OH− → ∗OH + e−, ∗OH + OH− → ∗O + H2O (l) + e−, ∗O + OH− → ∗OOH + e− ∗OOH + OH− → ∗ + O2 (g) + H2O (l) + e−, 4OH− → O2 (g) + 2H2O (l) + 4e− In an alkaline medium, the typical mechanism of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involves several steps. Initially, a hydroxyl anion (OH-) from the electrolyte is adsorbed onto the active site (M) through single electron oxidation, resulting in the formation of M-*OH. Subsequently, the removal of H+ and e− from M-*OH leads to the formation of M-*O. This mechanism can be explained in two different ways [35]. The first path, known as the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), involves the reaction of M-*O with an OH- to form M-*OOH. This intermediate then reacts with another OH- to produce O2 and H2O. The second path, called the lattice oxygen evolution mechanism (LOM), directly involves the participation of lattice oxygen in the oxide catalyst in the coupling of O-O bonds, enabling OER without being constrained by the adsorption energy scaling relationship of AEM. In the AEM pathway, the OER process is highly dependent on the adsorption energies of the O-intermediates [21,37]. As a result, catalysts utilizing LOM exhibit better OER activity compared to AEM. The key factor in LOM is the effective metal-oxygen covalency in metal oxides, which allows for the manipulation of the electronic structure. The evolved O2 in this mechanism partially originates from lattice oxygen in metal oxides and the deprotonation of *OH, which is the rate-determining step. Therefore, when OER takes place via the LOM pathway on metal oxides, it shows a lower Tafel slope, as compared with the AEM counterparts. So, the low Tafel slope of ∼65 mv dec−1 for the best catalyst indicates that the dominating mechanism in this catalyst is associated with the participation of lattice oxygen during OER (LOM). The oxygen evolution reaction studies of all the prepared catalysts and their properties were investigated in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Fig. 5 (a) represents the polarization curve of 5% IrO2 / SBA-16, 10% IrO2 / SBA-16 and 5% Co3O4 / 10% IrO2 / SBA-16 catalysts. The potential was measured for all the catalysts at a scan rate of 2 mV/s. 5% Co3O4 / 10% IrO2 / SBA-16 catalyst shows lesser overpotential of 278 mV at 10 mA cm−2 as related with other catalyst in this work. Fig. 5b indicate Tafel slopes of 5% IrO2 / SBA-16, 10% IrO2 / SBA-16, 5% Co3O4 / 10% IrO2 / SBA-16 catalysts were the values 75, 73, 65 mV dec−1 respectively. It was suggested that the 5% Co3O4 / 10% IrO2 / SBA-16 catalyst shows maximum reaction kinetics. The small Tafel slope of 65 mV dec−1 for 5% Co3O4 / 10% IrO2 / SBA-16 catalysts indicate that the rate determining step is a step after the initial electron transfer reaction [38] The impedance spectroscopy in Fig. 5c indicates the promising reaction kinetics of the 5% Co3O4 / 10% IrO2 / SBA-16 catalyst, and their charge transfer resistance was (0.547 Ω), which was lower than that of the 5% IrO2 / SBA-16 (1.647 Ω), 10% IrO2 / SBA-16 (0.647 Ω) catalysts. It meant that the 5% Co3O4 / 10% IrO2 / SBA-16 catalyst had faster electron transfer kinetics. Fig. 5d represents the double capacitance of 5% IrO2 / SBA-16, 10% IrO2 / SBA-16, 5% Co3O4 / 10% IrO2 / SBA-16 catalysts and their corresponding values were 1.05, 1.92 and 2.65 mF cm−2 and these results suggested that 5% Co3O4 / 10% IrO2 / SBA-16 has utmost active sites than the 5% IrO2 / SBA-16 and 10% IrO2 / SBA-16 catalysts. Furthermore, at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 the chronoamperometry test was utilized to evaluate the stability of the 5% Co3O4 / 10% IrO2 / SBA-16 catalyst. Fig. 5e indicates that the 5% Co3O4 / 10% IrO2 / SBA-16 catalyst has no potential change after 12 hours, indicating excellent electrocatalytic stability. In addition, Fig. 5f depicts the stability of a 5% Co3O4 / 10% IrO2 / SBA-16 catalyst obtained after chronoamperometry test and was confirmed via LSV curve. Following chronoamperometry test, voltage variations of roughly 5 mV were found, indicating high stability in alkaline medium. When compared to other catalysts utilized in this study, the 5% Co3O4 / 10% IrO2 / SBA-16 catalyst exhibits the highest OER activity. This catalyst high activity is attributed to the following factors. The addition of cobalt ion to the noble metal iridium may alter the catalytic characteristics. The addition of cobalt may increase electrical conductivity while decreasing resistance. Furthermore, the significant structural characteristics such as their high surface area, high metal particle dispersion and synergistic effect could contribute a small Tafel slope, lower Rct and high double layer capacitance Cdl. Indeed, the mesoporous silica provide high surface area for accommodating active species and it may play a significant role in the OER activity [39]. 4 Conclusions The Ir and Co oxide nanoparticles supported mesoporous catalyst were prepared by hydrothermal and impregnation method, which is an efficient method for the preparation of inexpensive anode materials for OER reaction. HR-TEM images with particle size distribution curve indicated that a large number of smaller particles were located on the external surface of the catalyst, which providing more active sites for electron transport. The mesostructured silica supports play a crucial role because it prevents the catalyst from the aggregation of active species. Furthermore, the activity of catalyst was increased with increasing IrO2 oxide content and further the addition of cobalt oxide to the IrO2 could enhanced the catalytic activity. The polarization curves were recorded by LSV showed less onset potential value of 1.61 V and an overpotential value of 380 mV for 5% Co3O4 / 10% IrO2 / SBA-16 catalyst. The enhanced activity of this catalyst might be due to the smaller particle size of iridium oxide, and addition of cobalt oxide and further the high surface area support. This catalyst exhibits high stability while maintaining maximum current density during OER, suggesting that mesoporous Co3O4/IrO2 bimetallic catalyst was of practical importance in the development of anode materials.

        "dc:description": "A non-conducting mesoporous silica support (SBA-16) with active supported electroactive iridium and cobalt was synthesized by a simple hydrothermal and impregnation method. The synthesized catalysts were represented as 5% IrO2/SBA-16, 10% IrO2/SBA-16, and 5% Co3O4 / 10% IrO2, respectively. All catalysts were characterized by XRD, BET-Surface area, XPS, EDAX, and HR-TEM techniques to study their structural, morphological, chemical and micro structural properties. Small-angle XRD confirmed the mesoporous nature of the material formation, showing major faces at (100), (110), (200), and (220). High-angle XRD confirmed the formation of Co3O4 and IrO2 phase on the catalyst surface. Nitrogen sorption isotherm showed a ordered material with surface areas of the decreasing order of 5% IrO2/SBA-16, 10% IrO2/SBA-16, and 5% Co3O4/10% IrO2/SBA-16, respectively. EDAX analysis confirmed the presence of Ir and Co levels in the bimetallic catalysts. The oxidation state of Ir +4 and Co3+ were confirmed by XPS analysis. HR-TEM images showed that this material was highly porous and contained active metal particles dispersed throughout the surface. These metal particles play an important role in decreasing lower overpotential and current densities. In particular, the 5% Co3O4 /10% IrO2/SBA-16 showed a lower overpotential of 380 mV at a current density of 10 mA. Compared to the activities of all the catalysts, 5% Co3O4 /10% IrO2/SBA-16 showed higher activity due to the broad distribution of active sites with frequent electron transfers. Furthermore, during chronopotentiometry testing, a stable potential was maintained for over 12 hours at a constant current density of 10 mA.",
