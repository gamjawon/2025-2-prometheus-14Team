The effect of added micellar CTABr, 4, on the rates and product distributions (the hexene: hexane and the cis'.trans alkene ratios) is reported and discussed briefly. Introduction Much attention has been paid to simple model systems which may mimic the reactions of nitrogen-reducing enzymes known as nitrogenases [1, 2]. Systematic work by Schrauzer and his coworkers [2, 3] indicated that molybdenum-thiol chelates are good catalysts of the reduction of several substrates of nitrogenases, using NaBH4 or Na2S204 as electron donors, and showed the essential role played by the molybdenum in the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Particular attention was devoted [2-5] to the molybdenum-cysteine complex Mo-Cys, (1), and other cysteine derivatives. ^\"a n on y^ ^s^^Jy CHr\"co-0 0 O-CU'\"-^ 2- 2 Na* (l) As expected from very simple model systems, the efficiency and selectivity of the enzyme, particularly in the reduction of N3, could not be duplicated [2-6]. As pointed out by Stiefel and coworkers [6], however, 0304-5102/84/$3.00 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 44 one should not look solely at the chemistry of the model which happens to mimic the enzyme, but at the chemistry of the system as a whole. Nitrogenases reduce acetylene to ethylene and are not effective with any larger alkyne; the molybdothiol catalysts are not so selective and are effective also towards larger homologues of acetylene, such as propyne and butyne, although their activity rapidly decreases on increasing the chain length due probably to steric restrictions at the active site [7]. We have been attracted to the possibility of exploiting this apparent lack of substrate selectivity in reducing higher alkynes to alkenes with high stereoselectivity using these very simple catalysts. In connection with other studies on the kinetic effects of micelles, we also wished to explore the effect of cationic micelles* on the molybdothiol catalysts and the possibil- ity of using surfactant chelates capable of forming functional micellar aggreg- ates in aqueous media. We report here the results of a preliminary investiga- tion on the activity ofMo-Cys (1), on the complex MoO^S CHz CHz NH;); of structure 2, according to Kay and Mitchell [9], and on a Mo(VI) complex with surfactant 3, a cysteine derivative described by Moss and his coworkers [9,10]. The above complexes were investigated as catalysts in the reduction of I-, 2- and 3-hexyne in solutions of NaBH4 in the absence and in the presence ofCTABr(4).

By reaction of surfactant 3 and NaaMo04, under the conditions used to prepare 2, we obtained a brown product containing one molybde- num atom per mole of detergent whose IR spectrum indicated the presence *The effect of surfactants on the reduction of azo- and hydrazo-benzene to aniline using molybdothiol catalysts has been reported recently [81. 45 of a cis-MoOi group (strong bands [9] at 892 and 870 cm\"1) and the absence of a doubly bridged MoOaMo group (no significant bands in the region 600 - 700 cm\"1). This complex (3-Mo) is only slightly soluble in water but slightly more. soluble in the presence of excess CTABr; a c.m.c. value of 2.3 X lO\"5, close to its solubility limits, was obtained by surface tension measurements in a 0.02 M borate buffer, pH 9.6, at 20 C. The low solubil- ity in aqueous media and the apparent modest activity (see below) did not stimulate us to define the structure of 3-Mo by X-ray analysis. Preliminary experiments showed that (a) the isomeric hexynes are reduced by NaBH4 in the presence of the catalysts under investigation (1-hexyne is reduced in the presence of 1 approximately 12 times slower than acetylene under the same conditions (see below)); (b) virtually the same activity was obtained (after a 24 h 'incubation' time) using the correct molar ratio of NaaMoO^ and either cysteine, aminoethanethiol or surfactant 3 as using the preformed complexes 1, 2 or 3-Mo; (c) the activity of the catalytic systems increased substantially after 3 - 5 h and reached an opti- mum activity after 15 - 24 h following solution of the molybdenum catalysts. We routinely allowed a 25 h 'incubation' time but in the case of 3-Mo and CTABr a 70 h time was needed in order to obtain clear solutions; (d) hex- enes, as well as other alkenes, are not converted to the corresponding alkanes by NaBH4 and the catalysts investigated to any detectable extent. All the assays for alkyne reduction were carried out under exactly the same conditions (similar to those described by other authors [7, 11]) in a properly designed thermostatted vessel fitted with a 50 ml capacity syringe in which the gases were allowed to expand. Typical reactions were run by injecting 0.5 ml of a freshly prepared NaBH4 (1.35 M) solution into 4.5 ml of a solution consisting of the catalyst and alkyne disolved in a buffer (pH 9.6) containing 11% (v/v) methanoi. Reaction mixtures, under a pure argon atmosphere, were shaken at 20 C and the gases periodically with- drawn for GC analysis. Authentic samples of alkynes, alkenes and alkanes were used for calibration during GC analysis. A 5 -10% reproducibility was thus ensured, less than desirable and yet better than with any other anal- ytical method we tried in preliminary experiments. Figure 1 shows the results of the reduction of 1-hexyne with 1 in the presence of CTABr. Within experimental error, material balance indicated that hexynes are converted to the corresponding hexenes and hexane with no other product being formed. Addition of CTABr increased the apparent activity of catalysts 1 and 2 in the reduction of 1-hexyne depending on the molar ratio. Thus the per- centage conversions after 2 h for a solution of 1 (5 X 10~3 M) and CTABr concentrations of 0, 5, 10 and 20 (X10~3 M) were 30, 45, 45 and 32, respec- tively, indicating that the kinetic benefits arising from the addition of surfactant decreased for molar ratios CTABr: 1 greater than two. Table 1 summarizes the data obtained using a solution of the molybde- num catalyst at a concentration of 2 X 10~2 M and equimolar amounts of CTABr (when present). The reactivity of the systems is reported in terms of 46 time (h) Fig. 1.

For other conditions employed see text. the initial rate constants relative to 1 in the absence of CTABr. The initial rates were estimated from the rate of decrease of hexyne concentration over the first 5 - 8% of the reaction and are to be regarded only as approximate. Table 1 also shows the hexene:hexane ratios and, in the case of 2- and 3- hexynes, the cis'.trans ratios for the resulting hexenes. Minor changes in the hexene:hexane ratios (decreases) and in the cis: trans ratio (increases) were noticed as the reaction proceeded; the values reported in Table 1 are those recorded after 3 h. In the case of 3-Mo, measurements were made for co- micelles of 3-Mo (5 X KT3 M) and CTABr (2 X KT2 M).

To our knowledge, complex 2 has not been investigated previously as a catalyst for the reduction of nitrogenase sub- strates, but is more active than 1 and virtually as effective with 1-hexyne as 1 is with acetylene. Somewhat surprisingly, 'internal' triple bonds such as those in 2- and 3-hexyne are reduced, at least by 1, more effectively and selectively than the 'terminal' triple bond m the 1-isomer. The results (see Table 1) indicate that steric restrictions are not as important as other factors such as, for instance, the nucleophilicity of the triple bond, in forming the bridged species 5 suggested [2, 3, 7] as the intermediate for the reduction of alkynes to ct's-alkenes. Following Schrauzer and his coworker&[2, 7], alkanes would result from the hydrolytic fission of an oxo-bridged binuclear species such as 6 and, therefore, the alkene:alkane ratio would reflect the relative ease of -S RC. 0 S- Mo^CR Mo ^ \\0^\\ \\ (5) -S^CR ;Mo 11 I ^R (6) formation of 5 and 6. In the case of complex 1, the ratio hexene:hexane increases considerably on going from 1-hexyne to the 2- and 3-isomers, and this would point to the fact that 6 may be more sensitive than 5 to steric constraints. Apparently, the same hypothesis does not apply in the case of catalyst 2, which is considerably more reactive and less selective than 1 towards internal triple bonds, assuming that in this case also species 5 and 6 are intermediates of the reaction. The present results do not allow much room for speculation. 48 Addition of micellar CTABr is effective only in increasing the rate of reduction of 1-hexyne, while it has little effect with the other isomers. This may be explained tentatively by assuming that the highly hydrophobic alkynes are deeply incorporated into the micellar aggregates while the active molybdenum species may reside at the micellar surface under the attraction of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. As a result, only with 1- hexyne, where the triple bond may be more exposed at the surface, are the kinetic benefits apparent. Moreover, the relatively high concentration of active species at the periphery of the micelles may favour the formation of dimeric binuclear species, and hence of the intermediate 6 relative to 5, yielding lower hexene:hexane ratios. The surfactant complex 3-Mo had too low a solubility to be useful as micellar reagent; when co-micellized with CTABr it appears to behave like complex 2 in the presence of CTABr thus suggesting a similarity between the active species resulting from molybde- num and aminoethanethiol and molybdenum and surfactant 3. At any rate, micellar effects are disappointingly modest and this may relate to the nature of substrates and surfactant. Experiments using less hydrophobic substrates and cationic micelles with counterions which may compete to a lesser extent than the hydrophobic bromide ion of CTABr with other species for 'external' binding to the micelles [12] are now in progress. Experimental L-Cysteine hydrochloride, aminoethanethiol hydrochloride, CTABr, isomeric hexynes and hexenes were obtained from commercial sources and purified following standard procedures. Di-J.t-oxo-bis[(L-cysteinato)oxo- molybdate(V)] (l) [4], dioxo-bis(aminoethanethiolato)molybdenum(VI) (2) [9] and cetyl,dimethyl-ss-(L-cysteinecarboxyamido)ethylammonium chloride hydrochloride (3) [10] were obtained as described and had the correct elemental analyses. Preparation of the surfactant 3-molybdenum complex (3-Mo) To an aqueous solution of surfactant 3 (28 mmol), NazMoO^ (30 mmol) in water was added at room temperature under a stream of argon. The red- dish brown precipitate was filtered off, dissolved in chloroform and dried over MgS04. The product was crystallized from a chloroform-ether mix- ture.

Catalytic reduction of alkynes The molybdothiol catalyst was dissolved in a 0.2 M borate buffer solution (pH 9.6) which had been degassed previously and flushed with argon. After 25 h, 4 ml of the solution were transferred into the reaction 49 vessel together with 0.5 ml of methanoi containing 1.5 pi of hexyne under an argon atmosphere. trans-2-Butene was added as a reference standard for GC analysis. After thermostatting the mixture at 20 C, 0.5 ml of a freshly prepared NaBH4 (1.35 M) pH 9.6 borate buffer solution were injected, the apparatus was shaken and the initially fully depressed syringe piston allowed to expand. Periodically, 0.5 ml samples of the gases were withdrawn through a septum for GC analysis using Varian 3100 instruments with 6' AgN03/10% ethylene glycol on Chromoso rb, or 10% squalane on Chromosorb columns at 25 C, with nitrogen as the carrier gas.
