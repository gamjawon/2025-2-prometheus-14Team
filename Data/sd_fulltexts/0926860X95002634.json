Akyurtlu *'2 Chemical Engineering Department, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey Received 7 November 1994; revised 13 October 1995; accepted 18 October 1995 Abstract CO hydrogenation over a catalyst with the nominal composition of 6.3% Mn-2.5% Ru/AI203 was studied in a flow system with a differential fixed-bed reactor operating under atmospheric pressure. The temperature was varied between 553-613 K, He/CO ratio 1-3 and space velocity 5100-27600 cm3/(g h). The presence of manganese caused the product distribution to shift to lower olefins. For this catalyst system, secondary alkene hydrogenation was found to be significant. The activity and selectivity pattern of the catalyst altered appreciably at/below and above 573 K. It is hypothesized that at/below 573 K, monolayer carbon deposits and above 573 K multilayer carbon deposits affect the performance of the catalyst. Keywords: Carbon deposits; Carbon monoxide hydrogenation; Manganese-ruthenium I. Introduction Production of lower olefins by catalytic hydrogenation of CO has been the scope of various investigations in the literature. The composition of the product stream from the hydrogenation reactions can be shifted to the desired range by varying the catalyst, as well as the operating conditions. It has been reported that Mn or Mn-containing catalysts gave high selectivities for C2-C4 olefins [1-6]. Ruthenium is known as a very active methanation catalyst and for its ability to produce longer chain hydrocarbons at high pressures and low temperatures. Investigation of the effect of manganese on the activity and lower olefins-selec- tivity (especially towards ethylene) of ruthenium is the subject of the present study. * Corresponding author. 1 Present address: PETKIM Petrokimya Holding A.S., 35801 Aliaga, Izmir, Turkey. 2 Present address: Chemical Engineering Department, Hampton University, Hampton, VA 23668, USA. 0926-860X/96/$15.00 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

Experimental The catalysts used in this study were Mn-Ru metals supported on Al203. The catalysts were prepared by two-step impregnation technique. First, Al203 pellets (ICI-12-1) were crushed and the portion, which was between 16-24 mesh, was impregnated with Mn(NO3) 2H20 (Riedel De Haen Co.) which was dissolved in water at concentrations appropriate to yield 1 cm3 of solution per g of catalyst. The mixture was dried in air at 383 K overnight. This material was impregnated with RuCI3 hydrate (Fisher Scientific Co.) using the incipient wetness method. The resulting mixture was acidified with a few drops of concentrated HNO3 to prevent hydrolysis and precipitation and then dried overnight in air at 383 K. The catalyst precursor was pretreated in He flow for 1 h at 393 K, 1 h at 533 K and 1.5 h at 723 K. A mixture of CO, He and Ar was used as reactor feed. Argon flow rate was kept constant at 15% of the total CO + Hz flow rate. The reactor was made of a ceramic tube (10.7 mm ID) which was placed in a stainless steel pipe (12.7 mm ID). The length of the reactor was 431 mm. The catalyst charge was between 1 and 1.35 g and filled approximately the center 5 cm of the reactor. The reactor was heated by resistance wires. Two iron-constantan thermocouples were used to measure the temperature at the top and bottom of the catalyst bed. The feed and product streams were analyzed by two on-line gas chro- matographs, one equipped with a thermal conductivity detector, the other with a flame ionization detector. A 2 m 5A molecular sieve column was used on the former gas chromatograph to separate Ar and CO; a 2 m Porapak Q column was used to separate C1-C3 hydrocarbons by the latter gas chromatograph. Experiments were performed using fresh catalysts. The absence of external and internal diffusion effects were verified experimentally. Almost all of the experiments in this study were performed at pseudo-steady state under differen- tial reactor conditions. As the steady state value, conversion corresponding to the 80-90th min of reaction was taken, after which the change in conversion was small. Generally conversion values were lower than 5%. Conversion values were based on total consumption of CO and calculated by using the peak heights from the gas chromatograms, using argon peaks to correct for the effect of volume change due to reaction. Selectivity values were expressed as moles of CO converted to the desired product per mol of CO converted to the undesired products. 3. Results In Table 1, the activity of 6.3% Mn-2.5% Ru/AlzO3 was compared with the activity of 2.5% Ru//AI203. The catalyst activity was expressed as the rate of consumption of CO which was obtained by using the plug flow performance equation for differential reactors. The presence of manganese decreases the T. Tercio~lu, J.F.

Manganese was used in the present study to shift the product distribution toward lower olefins. The olefin selectivities of the catalysts used are given in Table 2. These indicates that the steady-state C2H4 selectivity of the manganese-containing catalyst is about three times that of the catalyst containing no manganese. Olefin to paraffin ratio, C2H4//C2H6, is also affected considerably by the presence of manganese and the tendency for the formation of ethylene increases with respect to ethane in the manganese-containing catalyst. C3H6-selectivity also shows the same trend: the steady-state C3H6 selectivity of the manganese-containing catalyst is about 2.5 times greater than that of the 2.5% Ru//AI203 catalyst. The effect of ruthenium concentration on the catalyst activity and selectivity is presented in Table 3. It shows that the ruthenium concentration has a pronounced effect on the catalyst activity. Also, C2H4 selectivity did not decrease on 6.3% Mn-5% Ru//Ai203 although the activity increased about 3 Table 3 Selectivities of manganese-ruthenium catalysts 6.3% Mn-2.5% Ru/ml203 6.3% Mn-5% Ru/AI203 Rate of CO Hydrogenation 1.87.10-3 5.23.10-3 (mol/(g h)) SCH 4 0.49 0.40 Sc2~4 0.19 0.19 C2H4/C2H6 3.37 2.99 Sc3 0.24 0.35 H2/CO = 1; T = 573 K; SV = 13800 cm3/(g h). 108 T.

The highest increase in selectivity was observed for C3-hydrocarbons. It indicates that as ruthenium metal concentration increases, the tendency for the formation of longer chain hydrocarbons increases too. C2Ha/C2H6 ratio, on the other hand, decreases with increasing ruthenium metal concentration due to the hydrogenation activity of ruthenium. In Table 4, some literature data are given and compared with the results of the present study at the most similar conditions. The effect of temperature was investigated at a H2/CO ratio of 1, since, the ethylene selectivity was highest at this ratio. Experiments were performed at four temperatures, namely 553, 573, 593 and 613 K. It was observed that at 593 and 613 K, conversion levels did not increase correspondingly with the increase in temperature and even decreased at high space times: a change in the deactivation mechanism at high temperatures may cause this effect.

Akyurtlu /Applied Catalysis A: General 136 (1996) 105-111 may be distinguished in the behavior of C2H4 selectivity: it increases with proceeding reaction for He/CO ratios of 3 and 2 at 573 K, remains almost constant for He/CO ratio of 1 at 553 K and decreases for H2/CO ratio of 1 at 593 and 613 K. Increasing Cell4 selectivity with time is consistent with the observation that C2H4 selectivity increases with decreasing conversion. De- creasing C2H4 selectivity with decreasing conversion, on the other hand, could be an indication of the changing behavior of the catalyst. Delgass et al. [8] observed a slight decrease in ethylene selectivity with the formation of multi- layer carbon deposits, which poison the sites required for the formation of the longer chain hydrocarbons, thus shifting the product distribution towards methane and resulting in a decrease in C2H4 selectivity with respect to methane. At lower temperatures, however, the rate of carbon removal may become competi- tive with the rate of carbon deposition and thus, carbon layers may build up slowly. Overall C2-selectivity also showed different trends at/below and above 573 K as a function of reaction time (Fig. 3). The overall C2-selectivity remains almost constant with respect to reaction time at different He/CO ratios except the runs conducted at 593 K and 613 K, at which Ce-hydrocarbon selectivity decreases with time. Ethylene selectivity, as mentioned previously, increases with respect to reaction time at 553 and 573 K, although the C2-hydrocarbon selectivity remains constant. This may indicate that the deactivation occurring at 553 and 573 K, do not cause a reduction in the relative formation of C2-hydro- carbons; rather, they reduce the hydrogenation activity of the catalyst.

Akyurtlu /Applied Catalysis A: General 136 (1996) 105-111 111 may cause a reduction in the selectivity to C2-hydrocarbons through poisoning the sites required for the formation of longer chain hydrocarbons. 4. Conclusion In all the experiments, the main C3-hydrocarbon was propylene ( > 80%) and the unsaturate to saturate ratio for C3-hydrocarbons was always significantly higher than this ratio for C2-hydrocarbons. It was observed that the time-depen- dence of the C3-hydrocarbon selectivity changes as H2/CO ratio was decreased from 3 to 1 at 573 K (Fig. 4). Only at a H2/CO ratio of 3, C3-hydrocarbon selectivity increased with increasing reaction time but at the other H2/CO ratios, it decreased with time. Similar trends were also observed in the experi- ments conducted at different space velocities for each H2/CO ratio. Since the lowest carbon deposition is expected to occur at the highest H2/CO ratio employed in the experiments, one may conclude that a certain critical extent of carbon deposition may increase the relative formation of C3-hydrocarbons. However, generally the C3-hydrocarbon selectivity may be more sensitive to the carbon deposition than the C2-hydrocarbon selectivity. References [1] S.E. Colley, R.G. Copperthwaite, G.J.
