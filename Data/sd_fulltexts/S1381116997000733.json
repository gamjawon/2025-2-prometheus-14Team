Rovisco Pais, 1096 Lisbon Codex, Portugal Received 2 January 1997; accepted 14 March 1997 Abstract The transformation of acetone was carried out over a 0.4 wt% PtHMFI catalyst (Si/Al = 60) under the following conditions: flow reactor, 160, pressures of acetone and hydrogen equal to 0.75 and 0.25 bar, respectively. Methylisobutylketone, propane and traces of mesityloxide are observed as primary products while the other main products: 2-methylpentane and diisobutylketone result from secondary transformation of methylisobutylketone. The reactivity of the reaction products and of probable intermediates: diacetone alcohol, isopropanol and propene was compared to that of acetone, which allows us to establish the complete scheme of acetone transformation. Acetone is competitively transformed through bifunctional catalysis into methylisobutylketone and into propane. The limiting step of methylisobutylketone formation is acetone aldolisation over the acid sites of the catalyst while that of propane formation is acetone hydrogenation over platinum sites. Methylisobutylketone undergoes the same competitive bifunctional transformations leading to diisobutylketone (limiting step: acid coaldolisation of acetone and of methylisobutylketone) and to 2-methylpentane (limiting step: hydrogenation of methylisobutylketone). 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. 1. Introduction Methylisobutylketone (MIBK) is used as a solvent for inks and lacquers [1]. This ketone can be prepared from acetone through a catalytic three-step process: acid- or base-catalyzed production of diacetone alcohol (DA), acid dehydration of DA into mesityloxide (MO) followed by hydrogenation of MO over a noble metal catalyst [1]. All these steps are carried out at a relatively low temperature. Under these Corresponding author. Fax: +33-5-49453499. 1381-I 169/97/$17.00 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. PIlS1381-1169(97)00073-3 conditions the first step is reversible but the other ones can be made irreversible. Therefore, it can be envisaged to prepare MIBK from acetone in one step, with a very low formation of diacetone alcohol and of mesityloxide by using under hydrogenating conditions bifunctional noble metal/acid catalysts such as Pddoped sulfonated resin [1,2], Pt or Pd/HZSM5 [3-7], etc. Unfortunately secondary reactions accompany the formation of methylisobutylketone over bifunctional metal/acid catalysts. In this paper the complete reaction scheme of acetone transformation over a 0.4 wt% PtHZSM5 catalyst 156 L. Melo et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 124 (1997) 155-161 with a Si/Al ratio of 60 was established (i) from the effect of contact time (or of acetone conversion) on the yields in the various products and (11) from the comparison between the transformations of acetone, reaction products and probable intermediates. 2. Experimental HZSM5 (Si/Al = 60) was prepared by the method proposed by Guth and Caullet [8], 0.4 PtHZSM5 was prepared by the method previously described [9]: exchange with Pt(NH3)4+ in competition with NH4, calcination under dry air flow at 300 for 6 h, reduction under hydrogen flow at 500 for 6 h. The transformation of acetone was carried out in a flow reactor at 160 with PH 2 = 0.25 bar and Pacetone = 0.75 bar, WHSV (weight of reactant injected per weight of catalyst per h) between 2.4 h-' and 95 h-1. The transformation of the reaction products and of the intermediates: propene, methylisobutylketone, mesityloxide, isopropanol and diacetone alcohol were carried out in a flow reactor at 160 with P H2 = 0.25 bar and Preacta,lt equal to 0.05 and 0.15 bar, WHSV = 22.9 to 28.4 h-1. Reaction products were analyzed on-line by gas chromatography with a CP Sil 5 CB capillary column. The experimental methods used to recover and to analyze the heavy secondary products were the same as those used to analyze zeolitic coke [10]. 3. Results formation 3.1. Influence of contact time on acetone trans- Under the standard conditions (160, pHz = 0.25 bar, pacetone = 0.75 bar, WHSV (weight of reactant injected per weight of catalyst and per h) = 4.75 h-1), acetone is transformed into methylisobutylketone (MIBK) and also leads to propane (P), 2-methylpentane (2MP), diisobutylketone (DIBK) and to traces of mesityloxide (MO). The deactivation of the catalyst is relatively rapid particularly during the first hour of reaction. Thus after 4 h reaction the activity is approximately 2 times lower than the initial activity. This deactivation can be related to the formation of heavy secondary products: approximately 6.3 wt% on the catalyst after 4 h reaction, which corresponds to a conversion of acetone into these products of approximately 0.5%. These heavy products are blocked within the pores of the zeolite. Indeed only a small part of these compounds can be recovered in methylene chloride through a simple soxhlet treatment of the deactivated catalyst while all of them are recovered after dissolution of the zeolite in a hydrofluoric acid solution. IR spectroscopy shows bands characteristic of aromatic and of carbonylated compounds while GC-MS coupling indicates the presence of isophorone as a major component, accompanied by various polyalkylbenzenes (with 5 to 7 carbon atoms in the alkyl groups). All these compounds are retained in the zeolite pores because of their low volatility, of their adsorption on the acid sites and/or because their size is close to or greater than the size of the pore aperture. These compounds block the access of the reactant to the acid or to the platinum sites, hence causing a decrease in the catalyst activity. iS1Y (h-) 25 2.4 4.7 7.1 2.4 11. 2.4 19 95 20 IS to Tlc 5 n ~-.y ~ ~n -4 i W 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 Time (min) Fig. 1.

Melo et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 124 (1997) 155-161 The effect of contact time on the yields in the various products was established by the procedure shown in Fig. 1 on the example of MIBK. The values used were those deduced from the extrapolation at 800 min (i.e. after the rapid initial deactivation) of the curves giving the yields as a function of time-on-stream. Fig. 2 shows that MIBK, propane (P) and MO result apparently from a direct transformation of acetone (apparent primary products) while DIBK and 2MP are secondary products. The same conclusions can be drawn from the curves giving the yields as a function of acetone conversion (Fig. 3).

Transformation of carious intermediates and products of acetone conversion The transformation of MO, MIBK and of the probable reaction intermediates: diacetone alcohol, isopropanol and propene was compared to that of acetone through successive experiments on the same sample of catalyst. Two values of partial pressure comparable to the value attained by these compounds during acetone conversion: 0.05 and 0.15 bar were chosen, the hydrogen 158 L. Melo et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 124 (1997) 155-161 pressure being kept at 0.25 bar and WHSV of acetone and the other compound between to 22.9 and 28.4 h-'. The results obtained during the comparison of isopropanol and acetone transformations are given in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 shows that isopropanol transforms much more rapidly than acetone. Propane is the only product observed. This very high rate of isopropanol transformation into propane allows one to explain why isopropanol is not observed in the products of acetone transformation and why propane appears as a primary product. Another interesting result is that isopropanol does not cause any supplementary deactivation of the catalyst (Fig. 4). The same is observed when propene or MIBK are used as reactants whereas in the case of diacetone alcohol and mesityloxide a complete deactivation of the catalyst resulted. The products of transformation of the various compounds are indicated below: isopropanol -> propane propene - propane diacetone alcohol -> acetone > MO MIBK 2MP and DIBK MO - MIBK acetone, 2MP, DIBK MIBK - 2MP Table 1 compares the rates of transformation of the various compounds to that of acetone.

Discussion 4.1. Mode of formation of the products of acetone transformation 4.1.1. Mode of formation of MIBK MIBK is an apparent primary product of acetone transformation (Figs. 2 and 3). Moreover, its formation from diacetone alcohol (DA) and from mesityloxide (MO) is faster than from acetone. This confirms that the formation of this product involves the following three steps. 0 off 2 CH3-C-CH3 11 ~ CH,-C-CHz-CH-C3 (1) I ( CHs O OH O II i II CH3 CH3-C-CHZ-CH-CH3 - 10 CH3-C-CH=C~ (2) (DA) CCH3 Hz0 (MO)~CH3 O II ~CH3 CH3-C-CH-C ~CH3 (MO) O H~ CH3-C-CHZ-CH-CH3 ( MIBK) CH3 Acetone aldolisation (Eq. (1)) is the limiting step of MIBK formation. This step is equilibrated, the equilibrium being largely in favour of acetone: about 95% [11]. This explains the L. Melo et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 124 (1997) 155-161 significant formation of acetone observed during DA transformation. However, under the operating conditions of acetone transformation the equilibrium of Eq. (1) is totally displaced towards the formation of MO by Eq. (2). Moreover, the thermodynamic equilibrium between MO and MIBK (Eq. (3)) which is in favour of MIBK is attained for acetone conversion above 5% (Fig. 5). The mechanisms of the reactions involved in MIBK formation are well-known. The limiting reaction i.e. acetone aldolisation occurs through the following steps: O +OH OH 'H,-11-CH, H*~ CH3-C-CH., H+ CH,-C-CHZ (4) COH ,~+OH +OH OH CH;-C-CHz ~'CI-CH3 CH3-C-CH2 I +OH OH O OH II I _ H* II I C'H3-C-CHZ_C_CH3 CH3-C-CH, I CH3 -C-CH3 (5) CH3 CH3 Protonation and deprotonation steps being generally rapid, Eq. (5) is most likely the limiting step of acetone aldolisation. 0 06 x 0 oa 001) i 5 10 IS 20 25 30 Acetone conversion ( ) 35 Fig. 5.

The hydrogenation of the C=C double bond of mesityl oxide occurs most probably through the Horuiti Polanyi mechanism [12]. 4.1.2. Mode of formation of hydrocarbons Propane results from the transformation of acetone through the following three steps catalyzed by platinum or by the acid sites. 0 II CH3-C-CH3 + HZ P~ CH3-CHOH-CH3 (1 O) CH3-CHOH-CH3 H CH3-CH=CHZ + H20 CH3-CH=CHz + HZ -j CH3-CHZ-CH3 (12) Eq. (10) is the limiting step of this process. Indeed isopropanol dehydration (Eq. (11)) is much faster than acetone transformation (Table 1) and no isopropanol is observed in the products of acetone transformation. Propene hydrogenation (Eq. (12)) is also much faster than acetone transformation (Table 1). Moreover, propene is not observed in the products of acetone and of isopropanol transformations, which 160 L Melo et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 124 (1997) 155-161 means that Eq. (12) is faster than Eqs. (10) and (11). The very fast hydrogenation of propene allows us to explain that no 2-methylpentane (2MP) results from the transformation of this alkene. Under the operating conditions, the dimerization of propene 2 CHz=CH-CH3 10 CH, -~H-CH=CH-CH3 CH3 (13) would be much slower than its hydrogenation (Eq. (12)). Therefore 2MP does not result from Eq. (13) followed by hydrogenation but from the secondary transformation of methylisobutylketone (MIBK) as shown in Section 3.2. The reaction scheme involves the same steps as the formation of propane from acetone: hydrogenation of the C=O bond (Eq. (14)), dehydration (Eq. (15)) followed by hydrogenation of the C=C bond (Eq. (16)).

(4)); indeed neither methylpentanol nor 2-methylpentenes are observed in the products. 4.1.3. Mode of formation of DIBK DIBK is a secondary product of acetone transformation. Its formation can occur from aldolisation between mesityl oxide or MIBK and acetone followed by dehydration and hydrogenation of the C=C bond(s). Under the operating conditions, the concentration of MO is much lower than that of MIBK and despite its greater reactivity (due to its stronger adsorption) DIBK should mainly result from the following reactions between MIBK and acetone. O O H, O OH CH3.CH-CH2-C-CH3 + CH3-~-CH3 O'CH3-CH-CI-IZ-C -CH2-C-CH3 CH3 CH3 CH3 OH O (17) II CH3-YH-CHZ-C-CHZ-~-CHs H-sCH3--CHs-C-CH_CH3 +HiO CH3 CH3 CH3 CH3 (18) CHr--CHZ C-C:i=~-CHr +H7 P~ ..~ CH,-CH-CHz C -CH'r-CH3 CH3 CH3 CH3 CH3 (19) Similar for the formation of MIBK, the limiting step of the formation of DIBK from MIBK is the aldolisation step (Eq. (17)): neither alcohol nor olefinic intermediates are observed in the reaction products. 4.2. Scheme of acetone transformation The main reactions involved in acetone transformation are indicated in Fig. 6. Acetone undergoes competitive hydrogenation on the platinum sites and aldolisation on the acid sites, these reactions being the limiting steps of the formation of the main reaction products: MIBK and propane. This suggests that the greatest selectivity to MIBK could be obtained for catalysts having a small ratio between their hydrogenating and acid activities. This has been checked by using a series of PtHZSMS(41) catalysts with different platinum contents: the H./-Ha0 H~_ ~' O- = ~3 Pt rt Ac ~ ~ H,lH O _ ~ H D ~ P-'-~ M[BK rt H limiting steps O intermediate products not observed or only in traces over 0.4PtHZSMS Fig. 6.

Melo et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 124 (1997) 155-161 lower the platinum content the greater the MIBK/propane formation ratio [13]. However platinum is necessary to hydrogenate mesityloxide into MIBK. The desired reaction product MIBK undergoes competitive transformations into 2-methylpentane and into DIBK, the limiting step of 2MP formation being the hydrogenation of MIBK on the platinum sites and that of DIBK formation the acid aldolisation between acetone and MIBK. The lower the platinum content the greater the ratio between the amounts of DIBK and 2MP [13], thus agreeing with this theory. 5. Conclusion Over a 0.4 wt% Pt HZSM5(60) catalyst acetone is transformed into various products. The main products: methylisobutylketone (MIBK) and propane are formed directly (primary products) while 2-methylpentane and diisobutylketone result from MIBK transformation (secondary products). The reaction scheme of acetone transformation was established from the kinetic nature of the products (primary or secondary) and from the study of the transformation of products and of probable intermediates: diacetone alcohol, mesityloxide, isopropanol and propene. It is shown that the limiting step of MIBK formation is the aldolisation of acetone, while that of propane is the hydrogenation of the C=O double bond. The formation of 2methylpentane requires the same steps from MIBK as propane formation from acetone (the 161 limiting step being again the ketone hydrogenation). The formation of diisobutylketone involves the same steps as methylisobutylketone formation, the aldolisation step (between MIBK and acetone) also being the limiting step. From this reaction scheme it can be deduced that the initial selectivity to MIBK increases with increasing acid/hydrogenating activity ratio.

The transformation of acetone was carried out over a 0.4 wt% PtHMFI catalyst ( Si Al = 60) under the following conditions: flow reactor, 160°C, pressures of acetone and hydrogen equal to 0.75 and 0.25 bar, respectively. Methylisobutylketone, propane and traces of mesityloxide are observed as primary products while the other main products: 2-methylpentane and diisobutylketone result from secondary transformation of methylisobutylketone. The reactivity of the reaction products and of probable intermediates: diacetone alcohol, isopropanol and propene was compared to that of acetone, which allows us to establish the complete scheme of acetone transformation. Acetone is competitively transformed through bifunctional catalysis into methylisobutylketone and into propane. The limiting step of methylisobutylketone formation is acetone aldolisation over the acid sites of the catalyst while that of propane formation is acetone hydrogenation over platinum sites. Methylisobutylketone undergoes the same competitive bifunctional transformations leading to diisobutylketone (limiting step: acid coaldolisation of acetone and of methylisobutylketone) and to 2-methylpentane (limiting step: hydrogenation of methylisobutylketone).
