Although methane activation and its conversion to valuable compounds attract an increasing attention, methane conversion is often made in indirect way through the very energy-consuming step for syngas production from steam reforming of methane. Some promising results appeared to be of significance for the development of an alternative and potential route for the production of high value-added products from methane. Efficient conversion of methane to higher hydrocarbons could be realized via methyl halide as the intermediate. After the production of halomethane, they could be transformed to gasoline and light olefins over modified zeolites and SAPO molecular sieves. High conversion efficiency and selectivity indicated the feasibility of industrial application. The research gained recently growing interest from the point of view in both fundamental research and industrial application. The study on the reaction mechanism shed light on the possible route of Câ€“C bond construction from methyl halide, which is the very important issue of the C 1 -reactant conversion to higher hydrocarbons. Hydrogen halide generation during methyl halide conversion did not exert apparent im- pact on the reaction mechanism and the structure stability of the catalysts. This review deals with the evolution of the field and comments the advantages to be explored and the drawbacks to be prevented for the development of new and sustainable methane-to-olefins (MTO) and methane-to-gasoline (MTG) routes via methyl halides. Key words: methyl halides; hydrocarbons; zeolite; SAPO-34; reaction mechanism Natural gas is a vital component of the world's supply of energy. Technologies in natural gas utilization and sustainable development draw an increasing attention from academy and industry. Efficient conversion of methane to higher hydrocar- bons is one of the most important topics of natural gas utiliza- tion since 1980s and still remains a great challenge in energy sustainability in the future. The most successful processes for this conversion are still indirect ways. Methane is transferred by steam reforming to syngas, a mixture of CO, CO 2 , and hydrogen; the syngas can be converted to hydrocarbons (gaso- line or olefins) using Fischer-Tropsch catalyst, or firstly to methanol using Cu/ZnO/Al 2 O 3 catalyst and then to hydrocar- bons with methanol-to-olefins (MTO) or methanol-to-gasoline (MTG) catalystï�›1â€“4ï��. Steam reforming, the dominant process for production of syngas, is very energy-consuming: CH 4 + H 2 O â†’ CO + 3H 2 â€“Î”HÂº 298 = â€“206 kJ/mol 60% or more of the capital cost of GTL plants is associated with the reforming of methane to synthesis gas [5,6]. At the same time, even Fischer-Trosch process has been proved to be an effective route for producing high hydrocarbons from syn- WEI Yingxu et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 11â€“21 gas, the products always appeared in a large range. It is still difficult or even impossible, at least at the moment, to produce a single organic compound with high selectivity. The devel- opment of the process of MTO or MTG makes it possible to produce light olefins or the hydrocarbons in gasoline range starting from natural gas [4]. The disadvantage of these routes is their complication of the conversion from methane to target products. From the economic point, the profit of the two routes depends on the price of methanol and usually the plant with large-scale methanol production is necessary. This also obstacles the utilization of natural gas in some area without big methanol plant. Since the difficulties mentioned above, research works have been still performed to search alternative routes for higher hydrocarbon production through methane transformation. Some promising results appeared in the work of catalytic conversion of methane to higher hydrocarbons via methyl halide as the intermediate. In this review, the state of the art of new MTO or MTG routes by the usage of micro- porous zeolites and SAPOs catalyst with advanced properties will be addressed. 1 From methane to higher hydrocarbons: the state of the art In 1985, Nobel Prize Laureate, Olah and co-workers de- scribed a selective and very efficient monohalgenation of methane over supported acid or platinum metal catalysts [7]. Subsequent conversion of methyl halide into hydrocarbons employed bifunctional acid-base catalyst [8]. The most im- portant advantage of this process established by Olah and co-worker is its high efficiency because the tetrahedral ge- ometry of C atoms of methane is maintained and this is quite important for the construction of Câ€“C bonds, while the steam reforming of methane concerns the complete destruction of methane to give other geometry of C atoms. In 1988, Taylor et al. gave a cycle process for the production of gasoline from methane with chloromethane as the interme- diate (see Fig. 1) [9]. The transformation from methane to gasoline combined two stages, which were based on the work of Pierre and Conner on the selective functionalization of methane for chloromethane production [10] and the result of pieters et al. that the generated products of monosubstituted methanes over zeolite were independent of the substituent and depended only on the reaction condition for a given catalyst [11]. In the first stage of this process, methane, oxygen, and hydrogen chloride react over an oxyhydrochlorination (OHC) catalyst to produce predominantly chloromethane and water; in the second stage, methyl chloride transfers to gasoline with ZSM-5 catalyst and HCl as the by product. HCl can be recycled for re-use in the OHC step. Zhou and Lorkovic described the bromine-mediated process for the production of higher hydrocarbons through oxidative coupling of methane using O 2 as oxidant [12â€“18]. In the first step, CH 4 reacted with Br 2 giving a mixture of CH 4 , bromomethane, and HBr, and then this mixture passed over a metal oxide supported zeolite catalyst which condensed bromo with 100% conversion to products, and neutralized HBr to form the metal bromide. In the third step, the supported metal bromide solid was treated with O 2 to generate Br 2 and sup- ported metal oxide. The resulting product contained olefins and aromatics products with excess CH 4 and water. CH 4 + Br 2 â†’ CH 3 Br + HBr (1) CH 3 Br + CaO/ZSM-5 â†’ 1/n (C n H 2n ) + H 2 O + CaBr 2 /ZSM-5 (2) CaBr 2 /ZSM-5 + O 2 â†’ Br 2 + CaO/ZSM-5 (3) All the three reactions ((1)â€“(3)) were proposed to be performed in one pot reactor and the reaction feeds were simply O 2 and CH 4 . This coupling reaction predicted the possibility of direct utilization of natural gas in an integrated process. Selective bromination and reactor configurations, favoring compropor- tionation of methane and CH 2 Br 2 or CHBr 3 to CH 3 Br, are potential routes to improved carbon utilization of this process. 2 Catalysts for hydrocarbons formation from methyl halide Methyl halide, such as chloromethane, can be produced through the OHC process [19â€“21] or monohalogenation of methane over supported acids or platinum metal catalysts [7] with the methyl halide selectivity exceeding 90%. Following step for the conversion of methyl halide to higher hydrocarbons has attracted much more research interest from academy and industry due to the significance of Câ€“C bond construction from C 1 -reactant. Intensive studies have shown that the direct con- version of methyl halide to higher hydrocarbons can be carried out on a series of acid zeolites like HZSM-5, HBeta, and HMOR and on cationic zeolites such as faujasites Y and ZSM-5 exchanged with mono or divalent cations [22â€“31]. Most of these work presented the product distribution in gaso- line range from methyl halide conversion. In some recent studies, with the application of SAPO-34 molecular sieves, which has been proved to the most excellent MTO catalyst, methyl halide could be transferred to hydrocarbons with ex- tremely high selectivity for light olefins, such as ethylene, propylene, and butenes [32â€“43]. The structure of zeolites and SAPOs discussed in this review is listed in Table 1. Among HCl CH 3 Cl KCl LaCl 3 CuCl CH 4 + O 2 H 2 O gasoline Fig. 1. The cycle process for the production of gasoline from methane via chloromethane as the intermediate. WEI Yingxu et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 11â€“21 them, ZSM-5, and SAPO-34 were intensively studied in the open literatures and their structural features are depicted in Fig. 2. The structure of ZSM-5 possesses intersectant 10-member ring channel and SAPO-34 is characteristic of the narrow 8-ring pore opening and large supercages. A comparative study of chloromethane transformations were performed over zeo- lites and SAPOs by Zhang and co-workers and the results detailed in Table 2 indicated that the conversion and product distribution differed from the porous structure and acidity of the catalysts [34]. 2.1 Zeolite catalyst In the cycle process proposed by Taylor and Noceti, ZSM-5 was applied in the conversion of methyl chloride to gasoline. Chloromethane was catalytically converted to higher hydro- carbons, including paraffins, isoparaffins, naphthenes, olefins, and aromatics over a zeolite catalyst of HZSM-5. The hydro- carbons in C 4 â€“C 10 boiling range were the main products [9,22]. Long-term (>1000 h) studies were also been conducted to test catalytic ageing. Comparing the results with chloromethane and methanol as the feeds, the product distribution also proved that under the identical condition over ZSM-5, both reactants, methanol or chloromethane would produce similar product distribution. Their trend over time was also similar. Lersch and Bandermann studied the chloromethane trans- formation over metal-exchanged zeolite ZSM-5 catalysts [23]. In their study, alkaline earth metal ions, such as magnesium, calcium, and barium ions, and some transition metal ions, such as silver, copper, chromium, zinc, nickel, cerium, cobalt, and manganese ions, were used for modification. The results indi- cated that the activity, selectivity, and lifetime of catalyst sig- nificantly depended on the cation used. Magnesium ion ex- changed ZSM-5 exhibited the highest activity and stability. In an enlarged lab scale of 9 g catalyst loading, Mg-ZSM-5 showed a constant total conversion of chloromethane for about 25 h, while under the same condition, HZSM-5 deactivated completely with 24 h. They attributed the low coking rate of Mg-ZSM-5 to an improved selectivity to alkenes and a lower tendency to form aromatics compared to HZSM-5. In the study reported by Sun and his co-workers, the em- phasis was placed on maximizing the yield of light olefins, such as ethylene and propylene, from the reaction of chloro- methane over modified ZSM-5 zeolite [24]. They found that the addition of Mg cation significantly improved the initial activity and lifetime of catalyst compared with the catalyst of HZSM-5 without modification; further modification with P was helpful for the lifetime of the catalyst and the selectivity of propylene. The characterization proved the roles of P and Mg 2+ in decreasing BrÃ¶nsted acidity of zeolite. This modification provided an alternate pathway for reaction to occur with en- hanced light olefins production.

Fig. 2. Structural motifs of catalysts ZSM-5 (a) and SAPO-34 (b). WEI Yingxu et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 11â€“21 found that the selectivity to olefins increased with Si/Al ratio of ZSM-5, which was interpreted in terms of reducing hydrogen transfer, as the acid sites became more isolated. The exchange of Zn 2+ cation increased the activity and selectivity to light olefins. In Jaumain and Suâ€™s work, zeolites of Y-type, BETA, MOR, EMT, and ZSM-5 both in protonic and cationic forms were used as the catalysts in the chloromethane transformation to higher hydrocarbons [26â€“28] and the results are compared in Fig. 3. The catalytic conversion rate of chloromethane fol- lowed closely the acid strength in order of HBeta > HZSM-5 > HY [44,45]. The large pore zeolite catalysts, both in cationic and protonic form, such as Y, EMT, Beta, and MOR, in spite of their very interesting catalytic activity, led to the formation of large amount of coke in the chloromethane conversion due to the large size cages or channels present in these zeolites, while medium pore size ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts both in cationic and protonic form demonstrated their high activity and long life in the reaction and strong reduction in the coke formation. The detailed study of cationic ZSM-5 indicated that the conversion roughly followed the order of LiZSM-5 > NaZSM-5 > KZSM-5 > CsZSM-5. For product distribution, C 2 â€“C 6 hydro- carbons, such as ethylene, propane, butane isomers, aromatics, and HCl, were the major products. Catalyst aging tests showed that the most active zeolites were deactivated more quickly. The amount of coke formed decreased from LiZSM-5, NaZSM-5, KZSM-5 to CsZSM-5, which was attributed to less pore space available for the accumulation and formation of coke space in the framework exchanged with large cations. Bromomethane conversion was less studied compared with the work of chloromethane. Modified ZSM-5 catalysts were also applied in the conversion of methyl bromide to higher hydrocarbons [16â€“18,31]. PbO modification gave an enhanced selectivity for the production of aromatics. Over an active and selective catalyst of 5 wt% PbO/HZSM-5 (SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 = 70), yield of aromatics was up to 31.6% at 360 o C [31]. 2.2 SAPO-34 catalyst Methyl halide conversion reported in early literature was usually performed over modified zeolites. The SAPO type molecular sieve catalyst, with excellent performance in cata- lytic conversion of methanol to light olefins [46], seemed to be neglected in methyl halide conversion until recently years. SAPO-34 has shown its superiority in the MTO process and could be therefore a very promising catalyst for methyl halide conversion to other hydrocarbons, especially to light olefins, such as ethylene and propylene, due to its small channel size. SAPO-34 was employed as the catalyst for chloromethane conversion for the first time by Wei and co-workers [32] and presented high activity and selectivity for the production of light olefins [33â€“38, 41â€“43]. In the 350â€“500 ÂºC temperature range, choloromethane was converted to ethylene, propylene, and butylenes with 70%â€“80% selectivity for C 2 â€“C 4 olefins (Fig. 4). Increasing reaction temperature increased conversion and enhanced the yield of lighter olefins [32]. Changing the Si incorporation or metal (Me = Mn, Co, Fe, Mg) modification of the SAPO framework gave variable per- formance of chloromethane conversion [35â€“38]. Based on the synthesis, characterization and catalytic tests of SAPO-34 with different Si incorporation, the correlations between Si content of SAPO-34 with framework element coordination, acidity and catalytic performance were established. More Si incorporation gave rise to Si(nAl) (n = 4â€“0) coordination states and stronger acidity. Higher chloromethane conversion and higher ethylene selectivity were obtained over SAPO-34 with high Si content (Si/(Al + P + Si) = 0.10). SAPO-34 with low Si content (Si/(Al + P + Si) = 0.06) and the only coordination state of Si(4Al) favored the propylene production and reduced coke deposition [35].

The reactions performed over a series of MgAPSO-34s with various Mg stoichiometries indi- cated that Mg modification could efficiently lower the hydro- gen transfer reaction level and contribute to the improved catalyst life and light olefin selectivity, in particular for pro- pylene production. It was also found that the coexistence of metal species in the synthesis starting gel has effect on the Si substitution into AlPO framework. The 29 Si MAS NMR spectra in Fig. 5 indicated that, with more metal incorporated into the framework, Si island predominant formed and caused lowered acid density of MeAPSO-34 [37]. A relevant work published by Svelle and co-workers in 2006 reported methyl chloride and methyl bromide conversion over SAPO-34 catalyst [41]. Figure 6 gives the MeBr conversion versus time on stream at 300â€“450 o C and product selectivity at 450 o C. Comparative experiments were performed using methanol (MeOH) to elucidate whether the activity of reactant could change the product selectivity over an identical catalyst. The conversion levels of methyl chloride and methyl bromide were similar, whereas that of methanol was 25 times higher. Reaction temperature had effect on the stability of catalysts on stream, highest initial conversion appeared at 450 o C while the conversion declined with prolonged reaction time. Low tem- perature reaction presented the stability in catalytic perform- ance. Reaction-regeneration cycles at 450 o C indicated that SAPO-34 catalyst was an active, selective, and structurally stable catalyst for the conversion of methyl chloride to olefins. The effect of CH 2 Cl 2 impurities on the conversion of CH 3 Cl to olefins over SAPO-34 was also investigated.

CH 2 Cl 2 addition promoted the formation of aromatic compounds and led to rapid deactivation of the cata- lyst in the CH 3 Cl conversion to olefins [42]. 3 Mechanism investigation: Câ€“C band formation from methyl halide The fundamental study of MTO or MTG process in the past 30 years produced at least 20 different mechanisms, such as oxonium ylide, carbene, carbocationic, free radical, and hy- drocarbon pool [46â€“49]. There are undoubtedly many parallels between the reactions of methyl halides and methanol trans- formation to higher hydrocarbons. The main reaction steps of the methanol conversion to hydrocarbons can be summarized as in Scheme 1. The important distinction between methyl halides and methanol transformation maybe that the proposed intermedi- ates derived from CH 3 OH, such as CH 3 OCH 3 , are not accessi- ble from methyl halide. Accompanying the study of the transformation of methyl halide to higher hydrocarbons, some reaction mechanisms were also proposed. Earlier studies suggested the first Câ€“C bond formation from methyl halide through the methylation of framework bonded CH 2 group [27â€“30], while later work over SAPO-34 indicated methyl halide conversion to higher hy- drocarbons possibly followed indirect way as methanol con- version [49â€“51]. 3.1 Direct route of Câ€“C bond formation Murray and his co-workers studied the conversion of methyl halides to hydrocarbons on basic zeolites, including alkali metal and divalent metal exchanged zeolites [29,30]. In their work of in situ 13 C MAS NMR study, the conversion of methyl iodide on zeolite CsX was proposed to proceed through a framework-bound methoxy intermediate over CsX; and an analogous framework-bound ethoxy species also easily formed upon adsorption of CH 3 CH 2 I. A mechanism proposed for methanol conversion to alkene or aromatics [52] was employed by Murray to explain the con- version of alkyl iodides on CsX (Scheme 2). A framework methoxy group formed from nucleophilic attack by the framework site, possibly with the assistance of Cs + cation in the removal of the halide leaving group; the species was assumed to be deprotonated by another basic framework site. At the same time, a second methyl halide was polarized by a Lewis acid-base interaction to form CH 3 + for methylation of the methoxy group. The first species with a Câ€“C bond was pro- posed to be framework-bound ethoxy group, which quickly eliminated ethylene [29]. In the study of methyl halides reaction on bivalent metal-exchange zeolite catalysts, Murray and their coworker proposed a detailed mechanism for this reaction and also de- scribed an explicit role of the metal [30]. With FT-IR and 1 H MAS NMR, they determined the nature of the active sites of the divalent metal zeolite, such as ZnZSM-5, and proposed a modified mechanism shown in Scheme 3. This mechanism proposed three intermediate species containing carbon, all of them bound to the zeolite framework and one of them also stabilized by the metal. The methoxy species as species 1 had been proved in his study discussed above [29]. The species 2, framework-bound CH 2 species as the second intermediate, was speculated to form during the key step of hydrocarbon synthe- sis. This species was generated from deprotonation of methoxy species and was also stabilized by the metal available, such as Zn or Mg in the study. The final intermediate, the frame- work-bound ethoxy as species 3 was the first species with Câ€“C bond in the conversion from methane halide to olefins. In the work of Sun and co-workers [24], chloromethane was transferred to ethylene and propylene over Mg-ZSM-5 and P-Mg-ZSM-5. He proposed the ethylene formation via the following route: Mg 2+ was involved in the activation of CH 3 Cl, which was same as the first intermediate formation in the mechanism proposed by Murray [30]; While for Câ€“C bond formation, Sun gave different opinion that Câ€“C bond was generated via the addition of carbene intermediate to the surface methoxy group. With the elimination of this group, ethylene formed. Jaumain and Su studied the mechanism of chloromethane conversion over NaZSM-5 to higher hydrocarbons by in situ FT-IR [27,28].

WEI Yingxu et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 11â€“21 temperature, but no conversion occurred. With the increase of temperature, vibrations, characteristic of higher hydrocarbons (â€“CH 2 â€“ stretching and bending, C=C stretching and deforma- tion) were detected at 400 o C, indicating that Câ€“C bond for- mation occurred and higher hydrocarbons were produced. The creation of new hydroxyl species was also found during the conversion, with the absorbance at 3230, 3500, 3595, and 3672 cm â€“1 . They attributed the new hydroxyl generation to the in- teraction of framework oxygen atoms with HCl as a product of the conversion. They proposed that, in the first step of the conversion, dehydrohalogenation occurred on NaZSM-5 with the dissociation of CH 3 Cl and the adsorbed species of chloromethane was transferred to methoxy species over zeolite surface, which was widely accepted as the intermediate of chloromethane to higher hydrocarbon. The first Câ€“C bond formation occurred via a carbene transfer between neighboring methoxy group. The Câ€“C link was formed by the carbene insertion in Câ€“H bond of a methoxy group. From the first insertion, other insertions can occur and increased the chain length. Comparing reaction mechanisms for Câ€“C bond formation given by Su and Murray [27â€“30], both of them regarded methoxy species as the first intermediate, carbene generated from methoxy species as the second intermediate, and the final ethylene came from an ethoxy species. The differences be- tween them was that in Murrayâ€™s work, the formation of Câ€“C bond came from the methylation of framework-bound CH 2 species with a methyl group from dehydrohalogenated CH 3 X [29]; while the CH 2 species in Suâ€™s mechanism would be more free and can transfer from one framework site to the neighboring methoxy group and Câ€“C bond formed from the carbene insertion in Câ€“H bond of the neighboring methoxy group [28]. The two above-mentioned mechanisms were con- sidered to be the direct routes for Câ€“C bond formation. 3.2 Indirect route of Câ€“C bond formation The catalytic performance with efficient conversion and high light olefins selectivity proved that SAPO-34 was very excellent catalysts for the transformation of methyl halide to light olefins [32â€“42]. Methyl chloride conversion over acid catalyst SAPO-34 was also studied with in situ FT-IR [33,39] and three shifts of Si(OH)Al caused by three interaction be- tween hydroxyl group and adsorped species of reactant and products, such as chlormethane, alkenes, and HCl, were de- tected. Based on the FT-IR observations combined with the catalytic test results, Wei and coworkers proposed a realistic reaction mechanism. A possible way of Câ€“C bond formation from methyl chloride conversion is given in Scheme 4. The first reaction center, such as methylbenzene was assumed to be present in the cage of SAPO-34, which may come from the initial building-up with methoxy species or trace coke deposi- tion from incomplete calcinations [53]. Subsequent methyla- tion from the adsorbed chloromethane led to the formation of polymethylbenzenes and HCl, and then the polymethylben- zenes eliminated an ethylene molecular. Once ethylene was synthesized, additional methylbenzenes would continue to form through oligomerization and cyclization of olefins fol- lowed by hydrogen transfer. Since the SAPO-34 processes the structure of supercage and narrow 8-ring pore opening, the aromatic products, benzene or substituted benzene, cannot escape the narrow window of SAPO-34, and could not be detected by the on line gas chromatography, while the ap- pearance of absorbance at 1572 cm â€“1 , which could be attributed to Ï…(Câ€“C) n of aromatic species, indicated the reaction center formation as have been proved by previous work [54â€“56]. A further study of chlormethane conversion over a precoked catalyst using a pulse reaction system allowing a very short contact time showed that hydrocarbon pool species, such as methyl substituted benzenes or naphthalenes trapped in the SAPO-34 catalyst worked as the reaction center and governed the conversion and product selectivity (Fig. 7) [40]. The in- duction period with inefficient chloromethane conversion was detected and could be eliminated by coke deposition. Coke species confined in the cage of SAPO-34 worked as critical reaction centers and were responsible for the production of H O Si Al H O Si Al H 3 C O Si Al CH 3 Cl + CH 3 Cl HCl H 3 C O Si Al HCl + Me n Me n+2 H O Si Al HCl H O Si Al H O Si Al HClH 2 CCH 2 + + Adsorbption I Adsorbption II Adsorbption III 2 Scheme 4.

Methyl halide conversion on divalent metal-exchanged zeolite [30]. WEI Yingxu et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 11â€“21 olefins. The hydrocarbon pool mechanism [54,55] proposed for the MTO process can also be utilized to explain the syn- thesis of olefins from halomethane. The generation of HCl by-product did not exert an apparent effect on the yield of olefins over SAPO-34. Compared with the conversion of methanol on SAPO-34, the chloromethane reaction presented a prolonged induction period, which facilitated the direct ob- servation of the primary transformations. In the Svelleâ€™s study, methyl chloride and methyl bromide conversion to hydrocarbons over an SAPO-34 catalyst was studied and compared with methanol conversion [41,42]. The induction period could be overcome by adding a small amount of propylene to the reactor before admission of the methyl halide feed. The compounds tapped in the used catalysts was identified by the method introduced by Guisnet et al. [56,57]. In the catalyst being activated by propylene addition and con- tacting with methyl chloride for 1 h at 350 o C, the material retained inside the catalyst cages was dominated by methyl- benzene isomers. At 450 o C, methyl-substituted naphthalenes were dominant, and higher polyaromatic compounds, such as phenanthrene and pyrene, were detected in appreciable amounts. This implied that the conversion of methyl chloride and methyl bromide to olefins over SAPO-34 bears a strong resemblance to the more widely studied methanol to olefins reaction [54,55]. Co-feeding of CH 2 Cl 2 with CH 3 Cl led to rapid catalyst deactivation. Mechanistic studies also showed that CH 2 Cl 2 may be incorporated into the methylbenzene re- action intermediates and formed gas phase products via the hydrocarbon pool mechanism. Polymethylbenzyl chloride species was formed by addition of CH 2 Cl 2 to the aromatic reaction centers and condensed into heavier compounds and eventually coke species. 4 Aspect of HX as the by-product For methyl halide conversion to higher hydrocarbons, hy- drogen halide, such as HCl and HBr, is released as a by-product. One important question will be the catalyst stabil- ity against HCl. In Sunâ€™s work [24], he compared the IR spec- tra of ZSM-5 zeolite with Mg and P modification and expo- sure to HCl. The HZSM-5 sample exhibited the usual bands at 3745, 3725, and 3605 cm â€“1 , which were assigned to terminal Si(OH), internal Si(OH), and bridge hydroxy group respec- tively. Mg modification reduced the intensity of Si (OH) group and gave a new absorption of Mg(OH) â€“ ions (3670 cm â€“1 ). With further P modification, the intensity of all the hydroxy groups decreased. Contacting the modified ZSM-5 with the dry HCl, no new hydroxy group was produced. In his work, no obvious effect on the catalyst caused by HCl genera- tion could be observed, at least under the reaction conditions. Lersch and co-workers analyzed the catalysts after chloro- methane conversion and found that chlorine was taken up by the deactivated Mg-ZSM-5 catalyst [23]. Some loss of the catalytic active metal component, such as Cu, Fe, was also observed after regeneration of these catalysts. They attributed the active metal component loss to the evaporation or subli- mation of volatile FeCl 3 or CuCl 2 during the conversion. With these observations, they concluded that for the conversion of chloromethane, solid-state reactions with HCl and vapor phase transport should be considered in metal-exchanged or metal-impregnation zeolites and metal ex-changed zeolites might be destroyed after longtime on stream exposure to the produced HCl, while activation could resume the catalyst. Olefins and HCl were the main products in methyl chloride transformation using SAPO-34 as catalyst. In Svelleâ€™s work, the SAPO-34 catalyst endured several methyl chloride reac- tion-regeneration cycles at 450 o C. No structural changes in the catalyst were observed by X-ray diffraction after the re- generation tests. This finding indicated that SAPO-34 was a structurally stable catalyst for the conversion of methyl chlo- ride to olefins [41]. Wei and co-workers investigated the ad- sorption and conversion of chloromethane over SAPO-34 catalyst using deuterated CD 3 Cl as probe by in situ FT-IR spectroscopy and compared with CH 3 Cl [39]. In Fig. 8, the detection of the bridge deuterated hydroxyls Si(OD)Al with the absorbances at 2665 and 2651 cm â€“1 indicated the existence of the H and D exchange reaction due to probably the interaction of Si(OH)Al and the produced DCl. Very importantly, the reversible and partial breaking of Alâ€“Oâ€“P bonds as a result of the produced DCl has been clearly evidenced by the observa- tion of Pâ€“OD (2730 cm â€“1 ) and Pâ€“ODâ€“Al (2607 cm â€“1 ) species. Alâ€“Oâ€“P bonds would be restored upon removal of HCl by evacuation. A very recent work also provided the evidences of the reversibility of the SAPO framework and the crystalline maintenance during the reaction with HCl generation [43]. In gaseous reaction stream, HCl is basically a covalent compound with 18% ionic character and 82% covalent char- acter. Gaseous HCl can interact with catalysts, but does not alter catalyst structure. This also explains the excellent stability 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 20 40 60 80 100 C 5 + C 4 H 10 C 4 H 8 C 3 H 8 C 3 H 6 C 2 H 6 C 2 H 4 CH 4 S e l e c t i v i t y ( w t % ) C o n v e r s i o n ( w t % ) Conversion Pre-coke amount (wt%) 0 0.60 1.06 1.29 2.49 3.48 8.38 Fig. 7.

WEI Yingxu et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 11â€“21 of the catalysts. Only at room temperature with humid at- mosphere, HCl becomes an acidic compound with strong corrosive character. Production of chlorine-containing com- pounds or HCl is an old industry. With major production starting in the Industrial Revolution as a chemical reagent, HCl is involved in many industrial processes, such as the large-scale production of vinyl chloride for PVC plastic, pickling of steel, and numerous smaller-scale applications, including regenera- tion of ion exchangers, household cleaning, leather processing, and swimming pool maintenance. The technique for produc- tion and processing of HCl is mature and operable. HCl among the effluents of methychloride conversion as by-product can be recycled and re-used in the production of methyl chloride by chlrination or oxyhydrochlorination reaction with methane. This optimized operation makes methyl chloride transforma- tion to higher hydrocarbons more economical and sustainable. 5 Outlook and conclusion Natural gas utilization has become a very hot topic because of the energy crisis and great demand of higher hydrocarbons in industry since last century. Especially in recent years, the sharp increase in the price of brut oil calls for the alternative routes for the production of light olefins or gasoline. This gives a great chance for the application of the developed process of natural gas or coal utilization, such as MTO or MTG process, and also accelerate the research of some promising ways for methane transformation to high value-added products. As an alternative way for MTO or MTG process with syngas as the intermediate, the process of natural gas-methyl halide-higher hydrocarbons, with methyl halide as the intermediate, gave a new and promising route for the natural gas utilization. It is of special importance for the area without large-scale methanol supply from abundant syngas precursors and limited access to petroleum. This conversion may also become an alternate for the treatment of the polychlorinated organic compounds (PCOC), which often appear in the industrial hazardous solvent wastes. As mentioned above in this review, because methyl halide could be produced by monohalgenation of methane under oxidative or non-oxidative condition, for the production of hydrocarbons, a lot of research effort was put on the second step of this process, methyl halide transformation to higher hydrocarbons. In some studies, when the catalytic perform- ances of methyl halide conversion were compared with the result of methanol transformation, it is interesting to find that over the same catalyst, the product distribution maybe same [22]. With this indication, many MTG catalysts were also employed as the catalyst and promising results have been obtained in the production of hydrocarbons in gasoline range from methyl halides [22â€“24]. For light olefins production, compared with intense work on Methanol-to-Olefins, the pub- lications for methyl halides conversion to light olefins were relatively limited before 2005. Only Sun and Noronha gave the result of chloromethane conversion on P, Mg or Zn modified ZSM-5 with dominant light olefins production [24,25]. The application of SAPO molecular sieves made the light olefins production from the conversion of methyl halide a very poten- tial way. Chloromethane could be very selectively transferred to light olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, under a mild condition over SAPO-34 catalyst [33,38,41â€“43]. This work extends the catalyst family for chloromethane transformation and also finds new utilization of SAPO-34, a very excellent MTO catalyst [46]. Some mechanisms for methyl halides conversion to higher hydrocarbons were proposed based on different catalysts. Early studies suggested that methyl halide conversion over zeolite catalysts started from a framework-bound methoxy species and 4000 3500 3000 2500 2000 1500 900 800 (a) (5) (4) (3) (2) (1) 1 6 0 9 2 4 5 0 2 8 7 8 3 7 4 0 3 6 7 5 3 5 9 8 3 6 2 5 2 9 6 0 2 8 6 3 1 3 4 7 1 4 4 2 A b s o r b a n c e Wavenumber (cm ï€­1 ) (b) 3500 3000 2500 2000 1500 900 800 1 3 8 1 (5) (4) (3) (2) (1) 1 5 9 0 2 0 6 4 2 1 4 8 2 2 2 5 2 2 6 1 3 2 7 0 3 6 7 5 3 5 9 8 3 7 4 0 3 6 2 5 8 8 2 8 6 2 2 7 3 0 2 6 0 7 2 6 5 1 2 6 6 5 Wavenumber (cm ï€­1 ) Fig. 8.

WEI Yingxu et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 11â€“21 the key step of Câ€“C bond formation was related with a carbene species [28â€“30], while the later studies of methyl chloride conversion over SAPO-34 presented that the conversion went through an induction period in which cyclic organic reaction center formed and the Câ€“C bond formation from C 1 -reactants follow an indirect reaction route [33,41]. Hydrocarbon pool mechanism which has been proposed for methanol conversion was employed in the explanation of methyl halide conversion to hydrocarbons. The similarity in reaction mechanism of Câ€“C bond construction from C 1 reactants, methyl halide and methanol, has been proved. References 1 Bart J C J, Sneeden R P A.

Tel: +32-81-724531; Fax: +32-81-725414 Rational and efficient conversion of methane to more useful higher hydrocarbons is one of the most important topics of natural gas utilization. Although methane activation and its conversion to valuable compounds attract an increasing attention, methane conversion is often made in indirect way through the very energy-consuming step for syngas production from steam reforming of methane. Some promising results appeared to be of significance for the development of an alternative and potential route for the production of high value-added products from methane. Efficient conversion of methane to higher hydrocarbons could be realized via methyl halide as the intermediate. After the production of halomethane, they could be transformed to gasoline and light olefins over modified zeolites and SAPO molecular sieves. High conversion efficiency and selectivity indicated the feasibility of industrial application. The research gained recently growing interest from the point of view in both fundamental research and industrial application. The study on the reaction mechanism shed light on the possible route of C–C bond construction from methyl halide, which is the very important issue of the C1-reactant conversion to higher hydrocarbons. Hydrogen halide generation during methyl halide conversion did not exert apparent impact on the reaction mechanism and the structure stability of the catalysts. This review deals with the evolution of the field and comments the advantages to be explored and the drawbacks to be prevented for the development of new and sustainable methane-to-olefins (MTO) and methane-to-gasoline (MTG) routes via methyl halides. Graphical abstract Efficient conversion of methane to higher hydrocarbons could be realized with new methane-to-olefins or methane-to-gasoline routes via methyl halide as the intermediate by the usage of microporous catalysts with advanced properties.
