Kinetic analysis of acetylene hydrogenation over Pd-Mn/Al2O3 catalyst has been performed. Based on a set of data of stationary catalytic process and non-stationary experiments at 303–323 K, a reaction mechanism scheme is proposed. The overall process is found to proceed by two paths: the initial one comprises formation of an intermediate of C2H4Z2 type that may release C2H4 by acetylene attack (main reaction) or form ethane by hydrogen attack (minor reaction). The main and minor reactions are parallel ones. The second stage comprises consecutive C2H4 attack of adsorbed hydrogen with formation of C2H5Z species and their hydrogenation to ethane. This conclusive stage takes place at acetylene conversions higher than 75%. Kinetic description of two stages of acetylene hydrogenation has been developed and reaction constants are calculated. The activation energy of ethylene formation E2 equals to 64.9 kJ/mol. For conclusive stage of acetylene hydrogenation, the kinetic model developed gave rise to equation for description of selectivity-conversion dependence SC2H4 = f(XC2H2) up to XC2H2 = 100%. General factors for achieving high selectivity to ethylene have been formulated.

One of the major contaminants in the ethylene stream is acetylene (up to 3%), which poisons catalysts used in the downstream polymerization process and needs to be converted to ethylene by catalytic hydrogenation to upgrade product quality and increase overall ethylene yield. The selective hydrogenation process is usually carried out using supported palladium catalysts [1–6] having a good activity. Nevertheless, side reactions also take place including total hydrogenation to ethane and formation of oligomers (“green oil”). The former one decreases overall plant productivity, but the latter shortens the cycle length and lifetime of the industrial catalyst. Therefore, the challenge of the acetylene hydrogenation process is to maximize the selectivity to ethylene while obtaining the complete conversion of acetylene. As long as monometallic Pd catalysts possess the poor selectivity and stability, especially at high levels of acetylene conversion (> 99%), they having no prospects, and a set of bimetallic catalysts have been developed and used in the process of ethylene stream purification from acetylene [7–11]. Additives of the second metal (M) to Pd usually increase the catalyst selectivity at the cost of the catalyst activity that forces the higher temperature of the acetylene hydrogenation process and eventually shortens the lifetime of Pd-M catalysts. In contrast to the latter, Pd-Mn/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by decomposition of cymantrene over reduced Pd demonstrate the higher activity and comparative selectivity to ethylene as compared with the best Pd-M catalysts [12]. We may conclude, therefore, that Pd-Mn/Al2O3 catalyst holds the great promise for low-temperature acetylene hydrogenation to ethylene. The kinetics and mechanism of acetylene hydrogenation have been the subject of several studies [13–18] and have been analyzed in detail by Borodzinski and Bond [16], where the most elaborate models consist of 2–3 distinct sites, each catalyzing a specific reaction. Pachulski et al. [17] have studied acetylene hydrogenation over Pd-Ag/Al2O3, and evaluated 77 different kinetic equations with determining all kinetic parameters. The kinetic model with the best fit was that one based on a Langmuir–Hinshelwood reaction mechanism involving two different active sites for the hydrogenation of ethyne and ethene. Recently, Urmès et al. [18] derived a simple Langmuir–Hinshelwood-type rate-equations describing the experimental data adequately, and reaction mechanism being involve active sites only one type. Almost all models above assume that the controlling steps are surface reactions proceeding via a Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism, and that the adsorptions of reactants are in quasi-equilibrium described by Langmuir equations. However, Khan et al. have examined acetylene adsorption on pure Pd particles and found on heating PdC2H2 a hydrogen multi-peak desorption extending up to 500 K and traces of ethylene desorbing at 250–300 K. Ethane and acetylene are not detected [19] . On adsorption of ethylene, the same behavior is found, i.e. irreversible adsorption of C2H4 on Pd results in a carbonaceous deposit at elevated temperatures, with evolution of hydrogen [20] . As known, in the case of too strong adsorption of reagent/product particles, hindering desorption, adsorption equilibrium may not be established [21–23]. For this reason, we have checked experimentally the validity of adsorption equilibrium for reagents involved in acetylene hydrogenation on Pd-Mn/Al2O3 catalyst, i.e. H2, C2H2, and C2H4. As shown below, C2H2 and C2H4 display irreversible adsorption, and their desorption being absent up to 523 K; therefore, various mechanisms comprising steps of reversible adsorption on the Pd-Mn/Al2O3 catalyst for reagents above are experimentally inconsistent. In such a case, an alternative approach should be used based on adsorption substitution reactions, instead of the Langmuir adsorption model [23]. The present work is focused on the kinetic and mechanism schemes of selective hydrogenation of acetylene over Pd-Mn/Al2O3 catalysts using this alternative approach. 2 Materials and methods Kinetic studies were performed in AutoChem 2950HP (Micromeritics Instrument Corp.; Norcross, GA, USA) using a flow quartz reactor with two mixtures: 1–1.94% H2 + 1.05% C2H2 + 5.01% C2H4; and mixture 2–7.79% H2 + 4.05% C2H2 + 5.00% C2H4 (balance to 100% – Ar). The operating conditions were as follows: atmospheric pressure, temperatures 303–323 K, and acetylene conversions of 7–96%. The kinetic measurements were not influenced by transfer phenomena. This was validated by the absence of non-isothermal effects during hydrogenation. Reactants and products were analyzed with gas chromatograph Chromos, GC-1000 (Dzerjinsk, Russia, column with HyeSep N), and quadrupole mass spectrometer QMS-200 (Stanford Research Systems, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). As contents of C4 hydrocarbons in the products were negligible, the kinetic analysis was restricted to the hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene and ethylene to ethane. Two Pd-Mn/Al2O3 catalysts were synthesized using the procedure described in Melnikov et al. [12] and were distinguished in an additive weight and treating temperature. Catalysts were characterized using the low-temperature N2 adsorption, temperature-programmed desorption (TPD-H2), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (TEM-EDX), and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy(DRIFT) spectra, and the results obtained have been published [12]. All catalysts were pre-reduced in hydrogen prior to catalytic testing. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Physicochemical data of catalysts Table 1 shows some physicochemical data of catalysts obtained. As Table 1 shows, the main parameters for obtaining a good catalyst are hydrogen treatment temperature (at least 570 K) and additive weight providing Mn/Pd ratio of at least 2. For such catalysts, one may observe a dramatic fall in H2 adsorption as measured by TPD [12]. Probably, this phenomenon may be one of the key factors providing the high selectivity to ethylene. Taken in combination, the parameters above provide both active and selective Pd-Mn/Al2O3 catalysts. As Table 1 shows, to increase selectivity to ethylene, hydrogen adsorption should be suppressed. The latter may be achieved at Mn/Pd ratio of at least 2. Therefore, the following experiments relate to the catalysts having Mn/Pd = 2 only. 3.2 Acetylene hydrogenation To describe a general form of the kinetics of acetylene hydrogenation, it is necessary to reveal factors influencing the acetylene conversion at constant temperature, such as reactant concentration and contact time [17]. Fig. 1 shows the conversion of acetylene ( X ) as a function of contact time (a) and reactant concentrations (b) at 313 K for various Pd-Mn/Al2O3 samples. The linear form of X ( t ) indicates the overall zero order by reactants. The conclusion above is strongly corroborated by the independence of X ( t ) from reactant concentrations (b). In should be noted that conversion of acetylene on modified Pd-Mn/Al2O3 samples exceeds the conversion achieved on a monometallic palladium catalyst. The same behavior was observed earlier [24] and may be ascribed to the influence of Mn. To set a general reaction scheme, a robust instrument is the selectivity-conversion dependence S C 2 H 4 ( X C 2 H 2 ) or simplified form S ( X ) : in the case of consecutive scheme, i.e. C2H2 → C2H4→ C2H6, the function S ( X ) will have maximum, but in the case of parallel scheme, i.e. C2H4 ← C2H2→ C2H6, the selectivity is independent on conversion, i.e. S ≠ S ( X ) . As shown earlier [12], Pd-Mn-catalysts maintain selectivity at the level of 90% up to acetylene conversions ∼ 75% which implies the parallel scheme of acetylene hydrogenation to ethylene and ethane: C2H4 ← C2H2 → C2H6. As far as acetylene exhausted, ethylene is also hydrogenated, and the ethylene selectivity is dropped. To understand the unusual kinetic behavior of acetylene hydrogenation on Pd-Mn catalysts, this reaction was studied using steady-state and transient kinetic techniques. 3.3 TPD experiments Adsorption-desorption processes for H2, C2H2, and C2H4 on Pd-Mn/Al2O3 catalyst were studied using the TPD technique. Fig. 2 shows the results obtained after catalyst saturation with adsorbates followed by heating. As shown in Fig. 2, catalyst reduced with H2 and flushed with Ar flow adsorbs easily all reactants after their admission. On heating catalyst, however, only H2 partly desorbs at the temperature of ∼523 K. As to C2H2 and C2H4, the desorption of these species or their fragments was not detected up to 573 K. The same behavior of C2H2 and C2H4 over supported Pd was found earlier [25]. To elucidate the nature of acetylene adsorbed on a reduced Pd-Mn catalyst, we have investigated DRIFT spectra of reduced Pd-Mn catalyst before and after treatment with C2H2 (Fig. 3 ). Fig. 3 shows that after treatment of reduced Pd-Mn catalyst (H2, 523 K, 30 min) with acetylene (293 K, 10 min), H2 (293 K, 10 min), purging with Ar, and final evacuation, three additional bands are observed in spectrum: 2964, 2934, 2876 cm−1. A wavenumber 2964 cm−1 was assigned to vibrations of CH bonds in C2H2 molecule and bands at 2934 and 2876 cm−1 could be related to that of ethylene [26]. It should be stressed that vacuum treatment of the sample (2 h, 473 K) decreases only slightly the intensity of spectra in the region of 2964–2876 cm−1 which points out the strong chemisorption of species above. Based on data from DRIFT spectroscopy, we may ascribe this species as semi-hydrogenated acetylene CH2=CH-Z or ZCH2=CH2Z which were proposed in [12,16,17] where Z means active centers of the catalyst. 3.4 Adsorption substitution between reactants The crucial point for developing the reaction scheme is an elucidation of which reactant could displace ethylene from the species strongly chemisorbed on the Pd-Mn catalyst. Hydrogen from a gas phase or in a form HZ was shown to be incapable of taking the effect. Actually, we cannot observe any organic species during the TPR-H2 (temperature-programmed reduction of strongly chemisorbed acetylene) up to 523 K. We have found, however, that acetylene can take the effect of ethylene displacement in the following experiment, where the gas flow composition is monitored with QMS. First, the catalyst surface is completely covered with strongly chemisorbed ethylene, flushed with He, and the reactor is closed. The rest of the setup is flushed with a mixture of 2.76% C2H2 + He (balance); this step is designated by 1 in Fig. 4 . As shown in Fig. 4 (step 2), C2H2 supply in the reactor results in its uptake (cut of m/z 25, 26), and simultaneously the sharp release of ethylene (m/z 28). This effect of displacement of chemisorbed ethylene with acetylene was earlier found by G. Webb et al. [25,27]. 4 Process scheme and derivation of the kinetic equations 4.1 Model assumptions Based on kinetic and adsorption data presented above, we propose the scheme of reactions taking place on acetylene hydrogenation over Pd-Mn/Al2O3 catalyst, as follows (Fig. 5) . Here, some assumptions are made, namely: (1) the formation of the key intermediate C 2 H 4 Z 2 (step 1) is very fast and irreversible. (2) steps 2, 3, and 6 are considered slow reactions in comparison with step 1. (3) the nature of hypothetical and fast step 5 is unknown, but it is needed to maintain a dominant coverage of the intermediate C 2 H 4 Z 2 . (4) on a path of ethylene hydrogenation to ethane, step 6 is postulated slow as compared to step 4, otherwise, reaction order by H2 will exceed unity that contradicts the experimental observations. The first step of the scheme above is fast adsorption of acetylene with the key intermediate C 2 H 4 Z 2 ( θ ) being formed: (1) C 2 H 2 + 2 Z H → k 1 C 2 H 4 Z 2 The latter is converted into the C 2 H 2 Z 2 complex via displacement of chemisorbed ethylene with acetylene: (2) C 2 H 4 Z 2 + C 2 H 2 → k 2 C 2 H 2 Z 2 + C 2 H 4 The key intermediate may in-parallel be attacked with hydrogen that results in ethane formation eventually: (3) C 2 H 4 Z 2 + H 2 → k 3 C 2 H 5 Z ( + Z H ) (4) C 2 H 5 Z + H 2 → k 4 C 2 H 6 ( + Z H ) The consumption of the intermediate above is replenished at the cost of hydrogen addition to the complex C 2 H 2 Z 2 : (5) C 2 H 2 Z 2 + H 2 → k 5 C 2 H 4 Z 2 As far as steps 2 and 3 are considered slow reactions in comparison with steps 1, 4, and 5, in the presence of acetylene in the gas phase, the key intermediate will cover about the entire catalyst surface. On significant conversions of acetylene, however, the ethylene gas will adsorb with the formation of the C 2 H 5 Z complex: (6) C 2 H 4 + H Z → k 6 C 2 H 5 Z followed by the fast attack with hydrogen (step 4) giving rise to ethane formation. As a result, on significant conversions of acetylene ( X C 2 H 2 ), selectivity by ethylene ( S C 2 H 4 ) is reduced. During acetylene hydrogenation, therefore, the path of ethane formation changes, initially, up to X C 2 H 2 ∼ 0.75 (where selectivity by ethylene equals ∼ 0.9), ethane is produced from the complex C 2 H 4 Z 2 by parallel scheme (steps 3 and 4). At high conversions ( X C 2 H 2 > 0.75), however, ethane is mainly formed via hydrogenation of ethylene (sequential steps 6 and 4). The kinetic description of acetylene hydrogenation, therefore, will comprise two paths: the first one up to X C 2 H 2 ∼ 0.75, and the second one, where X C 2 H 2 >0.75. This phenomenon was observed in [16], where deviations from the model at ethyne concentrations less than 2000 ppm (i.e. X C 2 H 2 ∼ 0.8) were explained by a shift into another reaction mechanism. 4.2 Kinetic Equation for parallel formation of ethylene and ethane Since the key intermediate reacts by parallel scheme (slow steps 2 and 3), an overall rate of acetylene hydrogenation may be determined as the sum of rates of steps 2 and 3: (7) r A = r 2 + r 3 = ( k 2 C A + k 3 C H ) θ where θ – is the concentration of C 2 H 4 Z 2 , C A and C H – are the current concentration of acetylene and hydrogen in the gas phase: (8) C A = C A 0 ( 1 − X ) and C H = C H 0 − C A 0 ( X 1 + 2 X 2 ) where C A 0 , X 1 and X 2 mean the initial concentration C 2 H 2 and its conversions into ethylene and ethane respectively. Overall acetylene conversion X = X 1 + X 2 . On the other hand, one can express the overall rate of acetylene hydrogenation as follows: (9) C A 0 d X d t = ( k 2 C A + k 3 C H ) θ Division Eq. (9) by C A 0 yields: (10) d X d t = k 2 θ [ 1 − X + k 3 k 2 · C H 0 − C A 0 ( X 1 + 2 X 2 ) C A 0 ] , As shown by kinetic analysis, up to conversions X ∼ 0.8, the concentration of C 2 H 4 Z 2 remains actually constant, i.e. θ ∼ 1. Such a behavior may be explained by the fast formation of C 2 H 4 Z 2 (steps (1) and (5)) in comparison with their consumption (slow steps 2 и 3). Denote C H 0 C A 0 = μ H and with regard to expression X 2 = X ( 1 − S ) Eq. (10) may be reduced to: (11) d X d t = k 2 [ 1 − X + k 3 k 2 ( μ H − 2 X + S X ) ] and after integration, finally, we obtain the equation X(t) for stage 1: (12) X = ( K + μ H ) { 1 − exp [ − k 2 t ( 1 + 2 K − S K ) ] } 2 + K − S where K = k 2 / k 3 . Note that (12) will be correct at conversions X < 0.8 , because at higher conversions θ < 1. The applicability of Eq. (12) for description of experimental data X(t) was checked in Fig. 6 a which showed the model above corresponded fairly with the data over the range of X 0.06 to 0.75. The rate constants obtained ( k 2 ) are 0.285, 0.730 and 1.40 s−1 at 303, 313 and 323 K, respectively. Fig. 6b shows the temperature dependence of k 2 , and evaluated activation energy of ethylene formation is 64.9 ± 3.1 kJ/mol. This value correlates with those cited in Schbib et al. [15]. 4.3 Kinetic Equation for consecutive formation of ethylene and ethane This path is characterized by the monotone decrease of selectivity with acetylene conversion and contact time. Here, on the path of ethylene hydrogenation to ethane, step 3 can be neglected because of [C2H4]>>[H2] and k6 > k3 . Therefore, the main route of ethane formation will be the ethylene hydrogenation via steps 6, and 4, and the loss of ethylene is determined by the rate of slow step 6. As far as the process loss of ethylene is the main parameter of selective hydrogenation of C2 cut, there is a need to develop the dependence S ( X ) on complete hydrogenation of acetylene up to 100%. According to the scheme, selectivity to ethylene is determined as follows: (13) S = X 1 / X or X · S = ∫ ( r 2 − r 6 ) d t C A 0 Differentiation (13) by contact time yields (14) d ( X · S ) d t = X d S d t + S d X d t = ( r 2 − r 6 ) C A 0 Division Eq. (14) by X d X d t defines: (15) d S d X = ( r 2 − r 6 ) C A 0 X d X d t − S X and after substitution d X d t with Eq. (11), we obtain (17) d S d X = r 2 − r 6 k 3 θ · C A 0 X [ k 2 k 3 ( 1 − X ) + μ H − 2 X + S X ] − S X where formation and loss of ethylene are defined by the rates of steps 2 and 6, i.e. r2= k2·θ[C2H2] and r6= k6·θH[C2H4]. The current concentration of ethylene is C E t 0 + C A 0 ( X 1 − X 2 ) . Then numerator r2 – r6 takes a form: r 2 − r 6 = k 2 θ C A 0 ( 1 − X ) − k 6 θ H [ C E t 0 − C A 0 ( X 1 − X 2 ) ] Considering the balance of centers, one may neglect the coverage of C 2 H 2 Z 2 and C 2 H 5 Z complexes, because they appear in slow steps 2, 3, and 6, but react in fast steps 4 and 5. As far as intermediate C 2 H 4 Z 2 consumed, its coverage decreases and that of hydrogen ( θ H ) increases. We can accept, therefore, the balance of centers, as follows: θ H + θ = 1 , where θ H = ( b C H 2 ) 0.5 [ 1 + ( b C H 2 ) 0.5 ] and θ = 1 / [ 1 + ( b C H 2 ) 0.5 ] . Denote the ratio of initial concentrations of ethylene to acetylene C E t 0 C A 0 = μ E t and after division of the first fraction in (17) by k 2 C A 0 , finally we obtain the dependence S ( X ) describing a drop of selectivity on complete hydrogenation of acetylene (up to 100%): (18) d S d X = ( 1 − X ) b 0 , 5 k 6 k 2 [ μ E t + X ( 2 S − 1 ) ] · [ C A 0 ( μ H − 2 X + X S ) ] 0 , 5 k 3 k 2 X · [ k 3 k 2 ( 1 − X ) + μ H − 2 X − + X S ] − S X The applicability of Eq. (18) for description of experimental data S ( X ) (for mixtures having μ E t = 4.77 and μ H = 1.848 ) was also checked in Fig. 7 . As shown, model (18) corresponds satisfactorily with the data over the range of X 0.70 to 0.98. Moreover, this equation gives an estimation of selectivity to ethylene on the complete removal of acetylene: these values are ∼ 62% and 42% for 313 K and 323 K respectively. The corresponding combinations of rate constants b 0 , 5 k 6 k 2 equal to 1.07 and 2.1. Finally, model (18) allows setting the way for improving selectivity for bimetallic catalysts in the hydrogenation of acetylene. From the model, it is obvious that the main factors of high selectivity to ethylene are k2 (substitution of ethylene with acetylene) and k6 (interaction ethylene with hydrogen adsorbed), namely, the term b 0 , 5 k 6 k 2 should be as low as possible. 5 Conclusion The kinetics of hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene and ethane over Pd-Mn/Al2O3 catalyst at atmospheric pressure is comprehensively analyzed. The reaction has the overall zero order by reactants and proceeds initially via the parallel paths of the ethylene and ethane formation. At high conversions ( X C 2 H 2 > 0.75), however, ethane is mainly formed via hydrogenation of ethylene (sequential steps 6 и 4). The kinetic description of acetylene hydrogenation, therefore, comprises two models: the first one up to X C 2 H 2 ∼ 0.75, and the second one, where X C 2 H 2 > 0.75. In the system H2-C2H2-C2H4-Pd studied, the reversible adsorption of hydrogen is observed only. In contrast, acetylene and ethylene are adsorbed irreversibly, but the latter may be displaced with C2H2 from the active sites of the catalyst. Based on the findings above, the reaction mechanism scheme is proposed. The overall process proceeds through initial formation of the intermediate C2H4Z2 which may release C2H4 by acetylene attack (main reaction) or form ethane by hydrogen attack (minor reaction). The main and minor reactions are parallel ones. The second path realized at X C 2 H 2 > 0.75 comprises consecutive C2H4 attack of the adsorbed hydrogen with the formation of C2H5Z species and their hydrogenation to ethane. The kinetic equations “conversion (5<X ≤ 75%)-time” and “selectivity-conversion (75<X ≤ 100%)” were developed for describing hydrogenation of acetylene. These models fit experimental data satisfactorily and may be applied for the description of acetylene hydrogenation, as well as for screening the selective catalysts for this process. According to the model, the main factor for improving selectivity to ethylene is the term b 0 , 5 k 6 k 2 , namely, the catalyst should possess a high affinity for acetylene and low affinity for ethylene and hydrogen.

        "dc:description": "Kinetic analysis of acetylene hydrogenation over Pd-Mn/Al2O3 catalyst has been performed. Based on a set of data of stationary catalytic process and non-stationary experiments at 303–323 K, a reaction mechanism scheme is proposed. The overall process is found to proceed by two paths: the initial one comprises formation of an intermediate of C2H4Z2 type that may release C2H4 by acetylene attack (main reaction) or form ethane by hydrogen attack (minor reaction). The main and minor reactions are parallel ones. The second stage comprises consecutive C2H4 attack of adsorbed hydrogen with formation of C2H5Z species and their hydrogenation to ethane. This conclusive stage takes place at acetylene conversions higher than 75%. Kinetic description of two stages of acetylene hydrogenation has been developed and reaction constants are calculated. The activation energy of ethylene formation E2 equals to 64.9 kJ/mol. For conclusive stage of acetylene hydrogenation, the kinetic model developed gave rise to equation for description of selectivity-conversion dependence SC2H4 = f(XC2H2) up to XC2H2 = 100%. General factors for achieving high selectivity to ethylene have been formulated.",
