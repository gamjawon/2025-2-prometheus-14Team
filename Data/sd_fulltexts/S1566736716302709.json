Three dimensional porous nitrogen-doped graphene aerogel (3D-NGA) was successfully fabricated via a combined hydrothermal self-assembly, thermal treatment and template-removing process. The as-synthesized Pt/3D-NGA catalysts exhibit an interconnected 3D porous structure, high N-doped level and uniform dispersion of Pt NPs. In studying the electrocatalytic performance of samples towards methanol electrooxidation, we found that Pt/3D-NGA hold a high electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of 90.7m2 g−1 and better catalytic activity as well as stability compared to Pt/G and Pt/3D-GA catalysts. Our studies provide a simple approach to synthesize 3D metal or metal oxide/graphene-based composites, holding great potential for fuel cell applications.

Despite the fact that PEMFCs have many advantages, such as high efficiency, high energy density, and low or zero emissions, their marketability will depend heavily on whether these fuel cells can compete with the incumbent technologies on performance, cost, and reliability in a specific application [1]. Pt is an amazing noble metal catalyst which is suitable for various reactions; especially, both fuel e.g. H2 or methanol electro-oxidation and the oxygen reduction reaction taking place in PEMFCs. Nevertheless, the total Pt resources in the earth's crust are quite limited and estimated to be ~28,000tons, which may only supply 20% of all fuel cell electric vehicles [2]. To realize the maximum activity and minimum consumption of platinum, Pt nanoparticles (NPs) are commonly deposited on supporting materials endowed with high surface area [3,4]. Surface area, electrical conductivity, porosity, surface functional groups and electrochemical stability characterize a support. Recently, a novel two-dimensional carbon matrix, graphene, has attracted tremendous attention and is preferable to replace other carbon matrices for supporting metal due to its excellent properties such as high electrical conductivities, unique mechanical properties and large specific surface areas [5,6]. Nevertheless, the graphene sheets easily form irreversible agglomerates driven by the strong van der Waals interaction, which greatly compromises the superiority of the intrinsic high specific surface area of graphene [7,8]. Assembling 2D planar graphene into three-dimensional (3D) structures is considered a promising strategy to prevent restacking. The 3D structures provide graphene materials with high porosity, large specific surface area, strong mechanical strengths and fast mass and electron transport kinetics due to the combination of 3D porous structures and the excellent intrinsic properties of graphene [9–11]. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop a convenient and effective method to fabricate 3D graphene/Pt hybrids with high surface area, pore structure, abundant N-doped properties and uniformly dispersed Pt NPs, which are very suitable as fuel cells catalysts. Herein, we demonstrate Pt/3D-NGA, a class of uniformly dispersed Pt NPs supported on 3D porous N-doped graphene aerogel (3D-NGA). The hybrid presents an interconnected 3D porous framework, large surface area, high N doping level, and most of all, homogeneously distributed Pt NPs. Importantly, the as-prepared Pt/3D-NGA exhibits promising MOR activity and stability compared with Pt/3D-GA and Pt/G in acidic solutions, demonstrating its high potential as distinguished catalyst for methanol electrooxidation in fuel cell applications. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of the 3D N-doped graphene aerogel (3D-NGA) Graphene oxide (GO) was prepared from graphite powder by modified Hummer's method [12]. In a typical synthesis process for 3D-NGA, 30mL homogeneous GO (1mg/mL) and 3vol% pyrrole (Py) aqueous dispersion was premixed and sealed in a 50mL Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained at 180°C for 6h. After cooling down, the prepared gel was immersed into 40mL FeCl3 (10g/250mL) for 1h. After heating the freeze-dried graphene gel at 700°C for 2h under Ar atmosphere, the 3D-NGA was obtained by removing the Fe2O3 with 8molL−1 HCl and washing the residue until pH is equal to 7.0. 3D graphene aerogel (3D-GA) is synthesized by the same procedure, but no Py and FeCl3 were added. Graphene was also prepared by directly annealing GO in Ar atmosphere at 700°C for 2h. 2.2 Synthesis of Pt/3D-NGA Pt/3D-NGA catalyst with the Pt metal loading of 20wt.% was synthesized by a microwave-assisted polyol process (MAPP) [13]. Briefly, 20mg prepared 3D-NGA was dispersed in 60mL ethylene glycol (EG) under ultrasonic treatment for 1h. Then H2PtCl6-EG solution was added into the uniform ink with agitation for 3h. The pH value of the ink was adjusted by adding 1molL−1 NaOH-EG solution dropwise to 12.0 and the suspension was treated with consecutive microwave heating for 55s. Final products were collected after washed with deionized water repeatedly followed by vacuum drying. As a benchmark, Pt/3D-GA and Pt/graphene (Pt/G) were prepared using the same method. ICP analysis indicates the Pt loadings in Pt/G, Pt/3D-GA and Pt/3D-NGA catalysts are 15.8, 16.6 and 18.4wt.%, respectively. 2.3 Characterization The structure and morphology of the products were characterized by nitrogen adsorption experiments (QUADRASORB SI analyzer), field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi S4800), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, AXIS UTLTRADLD), and Raman microscope (Rhenishaw Instruments, England) respectively. All electrochemical measurements were carried out in a standard three-electrode cell using a CHI 650E electrochemical analysis instrument, with a platinum wire as the counter electrode, Hg/Hg2SO4 as the reference electrode, and a glassy carbon disk electrode as the working electrode. The cyclic voltammograms (CV) measurements were recorded within a potential range from 0.05V to 1.2V (vs. RHE) at a scan rate of 50mVs−1 in a Ar-saturated 0.5molL−1 H2SO4 electrolyte or 0.5molL−1 H2SO4 electrolyte containing 0.5molL−1 CH3OH. The catalytic stability of methanol oxidation was performed by the chronoamperometric curves at a constant potential of 0.6V vs. RHE for 3600s in a solution of 0.5molL−1 H2SO4 containing 0.5molL−1 CH3OH. To investigate the stability of catalysts, the accelerated potential cycling test (APCT) within the potential range of 0.6 to 1.2V (vs. RHE) were applied. The details of physical and electrochemical characterization can be found in supporting information. 3 Results and discussion The fabrication process for 3D-NGA is demonstrated in Fig. 1 . First, 3D graphene hydrogel was obtained through hydrothermal treatment of homogeneous graphene oxide (GO) dispersion with Py monomer. Next, the as-obtained hydrogel was immersed into an aqueous solution of FeCl3 to form a poly-pyrrole/graphene composite with encapsulated FeCl3 residues. At a high temperature (700°C), N atoms were doped into the graphene structure through decomposition of poly-pyrrole (PPy) [14], at the same time, the FeCl3 residues were converted into Fe2O3 NPs, which acting as “spacer” could efficiently prevent the agglomerate of graphene during the annealing process [15]. Subsequently, the 3D-NGA was obtained after removing Fe2O3 NPs by HCl. The final Pt/3D-NGA is fabricated through a microwave-assisted polyol reduction strategy. The structural features of as-prepared samples were first characterized using Raman spectrum and physical adsorption. Raman spectra of 3D-NGA shows two typical peaks, D band and G band center at 1345cm−1 and 1580cm−1, respectively (Fig. S1a). The ID/IG ratio refers to the extent of structural disorder in the graphene layer [16]. The ID/IG ratio of the 3D-NGA is similar with that of graphene, indicating that doping with nitrogen did not cause a significant increase of structural distortion. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis shows that a specific surface area of 281.7m2 g−1 for 3D-NGA can be obtained, which is much higher than that of common 3D-GA (151m2 g−1) [12], and G (69m2 g−1) [16]. XPS analysis reveals the presence of C, N, O, Pt elements in the as-prepared Pt/3D-NGA sample with a nitrogen content of 4.66at.%. The high-resolution N 1s spectra (Fig. S1c) can be fitted into four peaks at 398.2, 399.4, 400.8 and 402.6eV, which can be ascribed to pyridine-like N, pyrrole-like N, graphite-like N and oxidized N [17,18]. It has been confirmed that the presence of N species can efficiently promote the activity and stability of Pt-based catalysts [19]. The Pt (4f) XPS of the as-prepared Pt/3D-NGA are deconvoluted into three components as zero-valent Pt, PtO and PtO2 (Fig. S1d) [20]. The structure and morphology of as-prepared materials were also investigated by FESEM. As shown in Fig. 2 , the optical image demonstrated that 3D-NGA is a self-supported macroscopic cylinder. 3D-NGA revealed an interconnected, porous 3D graphene network with random open pores constructed from the graphene sheets (Fig. 2a). In contrast, graphene synthesized by directly annealed GO, displays heavily agglomeration, suggesting the intensive restack of graphene sheets, however, continued pores with sizes in the range of submicrometer to micrometers appeared in 3D-GA (Fig. S2). Annealing reduction process will force the graphene to aggregate severely, while, thanks to the existence of Fe2O3, the agglomeration can be impeded and 3D porous structure can be well retained. Such porous architecture not only increases accessible surface area, which would favor mass transfer and reduce the transport limitation of fuel at the electrode, but also provides more exposed active sites for the anchoring of Pt precursors and for Pt nucleation [21,22]. Moreover, scanning electron microscopic energy-dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) mapping images of the as-prepared 3D-NGA clearly demonstrates the uniform distributions of all the elements including C, N, and O (Fig. 2b). Pt NPs were successfully deposited on the as-prepared samples via a MAPP, which can be validated by XRD pattern (Fig. S3). TEM images confirm a 3D porous structure and the uniform distribution of Pt NPs with average particle size of 1.97nm (Relative Standard Deviation, RSD=14%) on 3D-NGA (Fig. 3 ). The graphene sheets in 3D-NGA are crimped and transparent, implying their restacking-free property. The HRTEM investigation reveals that the distance between two adjacent lattice planes is approximately 0.227nm, which is in good agreement with the Pt (111) planes of crystalline Pt (Fig. S4a) [23]. As seen clearly in Fig. S4, graphene sheets are thick and opaque in Pt/G, presenting strong tendency to restack. Additionally, a lower dispersion of Pt NPs on the graphene sheets can be observed in the Pt/G and Pt/3D-GA catalysts. It is evident that the introduction of nitrogen is favorable for the uniform dispersion of the Pt NPs. Fig. S5 shows the CV curves of Pt/G, Pt/3D-GA and Pt/3D-NGA catalysts in an aqueous 0.5molL−1 H2SO4 solution at 25°C. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) calculated from measuring the charge collected in the hydrogen adsorption-desorption region after double-layer correction of Pt/3D-NGA is obtained to be 90.7m2 g−1, which is much higher than those of Pt/3D-GA (36.3m2 g−1) and Pt/G (12.2m2 g−1). The high ECSA of Pt/3D-NGA can be ascribed to highly dispersive and small-sized Pt NPs. The voltammograms for methanol electrooxidation reaction (MOR) of Pt/G, Pt/3D-GA as well as Pt/3D-NGA are given in Fig. 4 . Importantly, the peak current density on Pt/3D-NGA (544.5mAmg−1) is 1.63 times higher than that on Pt/3D-GA (334.7mAmg−1) and 4.39 times higher than that on Pt/G (124.1mAmg−1), indicating that Pt/3D-NGA possess a much higher electrocatalytic activity towards MOR than Pt/G and Pt/3D-GA catalysts. It should be noted that the mass activity of the Pt/3D-NGA is also higher than that of recent state-of-art N-doped graphene-based catalysts such as Pt-NG-C (337.3mAmg−1) [24], Pt/NG-800-5min (218mAmg−1) [25], Pt/NG-800 (135mAmg−1) [26], Pt3Au/N–G (417mAmg−1) [27], commercial Pt/C catalysts (325.8mAmg−1, Fig. S6) and PtRu/C (480.3mAmg−1, Fig. S6). To illustrate the stability of catalysts, chronoamperometry was performed in the solution of 0.5molL−1 H2SO4 and 0.5molL−1 CH3OH at 0.6V (Fig. S7). It is obvious that Pt/3D-NGA presents a lower current deterioration over time compared to Pt/G and Pt/3D-GA catalysts, suggesting a higher catalytic stability for the methanol electrooxidation in acid media. The long-time stability of as-prepared catalysts was evaluated by accelerated potential cycling test (APCT) within the potential range of 0.6–1.2V (vs. RHE). Normalized by the initial ECSA, the degradation in ECSA is plotted in Fig. 5 . It can be observed the ECSAs of all catalysts decrease gradually with the number of cycles. After 1000cycles, only 21.3% and 39.7% of the initial ECSA of the Pt/G and Pt/3D-GA remain, while, the Pt/3D-NGA preserves 55.9% of its initial value after the same condition. It is worth noting that the ECSA of Pt/3D-NGA is much larger than those of Pt/3D-GA and Pt/G (Fig. S8) throughout the entire APCT. It is evident that Pt/3D-NGA has a higher stability than Pt/3D-GA and Pt/G. TEM images with Pt size distributions of Pt/G, Pt/3D-GA, and Pt/3D-NGA before and after APCT are displayed in Fig. S9. The particle sizes of the Pt NPs on three catalysts increases after 1000CV cycles, in line with their reduced ECSA. However, the agglomeration of Pt NPs in Pt/3D-NGA is obviously slighter than those in Pt/G and Pt/3D-GA. Pt NPs on Pt/3D-NGA catalysts still preserve the spherical shape, while some Pt NPs aggregate to turn into elongated shapes, indicating that Pt/3D-NGA is very stable during the APCT. The excellent electrocatalytic performance of Pt/3D-NGA for MOR may be derived from the unique structure of 3D-NGA (Scheme S1). First, the interconnected 3D porous graphene framework will maximize accessibility for fuel to the catalysts to ensure an effective mass transfer [28,29]. Second, 3D N-doped graphene framework could form a multidimensional conductive network to provide sufficient electronic conductive channels [30,31]. Third, the nitrogen atoms can activate the neighboring carbon atoms and accelerate the formation of OH by water dissociation, thus promoting the oxidative removal of the absorbed intermediate poisonous species [28]. Finally, the existence of large quantities of doped N atoms can improve dispersion of Pt NPs and provide strong interaction between the Pt NPs and the support, thus inhibiting particle agglomeration and particle detachment from the support [32,33]. As a result of integrating these advantages above, 3D-NGA holds great potential for use as a practical support accommodating other nanoparticles in fuel cell applications. 4 Conclusions In conclusion, a robust 3D porous N-doped graphene aerogel was successfully fabricated via a combined hydrothermal self-assembly, freeze-drying, and thermal treatment process. Owing to the 3D porous structure, high N-doped level and uniform dispersed Pt NPs, the as-prepared 3D-NGA exhibits exceptional electrochemical performance in terms of high catalytic activity and good cycling stability towards methanol electrooxidation when using a support for the Pt NPs. We believe this novel 3D-NGA is a promising support which can be further extended to develop other 3D metal or metal oxide/graphene-based composites for versatile applications in fuel cells, batteries, catalysis and sensors.
