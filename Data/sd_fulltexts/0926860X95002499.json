Figueras 1 Laboratoire de Mat~riaux Catalytiques et Catalyse en Chimie Organique, URA 418 du CNRS, ENSCM, 8, Rue de l'Ecole Normale, 34053 Montpellier Cedex 1, France Received 20 July 1995; revised 20 September 1995; accepted 29 September 1995 Abstract The vapour-phase nitration of fluorobenzene with dinitrogen tetroxide has been investigated over amorphous silica-alumina and zeolites with various structures and aluminium contents. The activity of the catalysts increases with the number and the strength of the acid sites, but is also very dependent on the accessibility controlled by the pore structure and the size of the crystals. Except, the zeolite BEA which is the most active and the most stable, the deactivation of the catalysts is fast since the activity is high. The addition of water to the feed increases the activity and the stability of all the zeolites, but decreases the activity of amorphous silica-alumina. A large part of deactivation is attributed to the marginal formation of 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene which stays on the surface of the catalyst, but can be eliminated by 'steam distillation'. No evidence of shape selectivity was obtained. Zeolite BEA proved to be a remarkably efficient catalyst.

Introduction Nitration, an important industrial reaction (for a review see [1,2]) is still usually achieved with the conventional method using a mixture of nitric and sulfuric acids. The substitution of liquid acids by solids is a challenge, particu- larly in connection with the protection of the environment. * Corresponding author. Tel. (+ 33) 67144390, fax.

Germain et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 136 (1996) 57-68 Since the pioneering work of Wilhelm [3], various solid catalysts have been proposed (see Refs. in [4]) and the application of zeolites to nitration was the object of more detailed recent developments [5-13]. Previously [4], we have studied the kinetics of the vapour-phase nitration of fluorobenzene with dinitrogen tetroxide catalysed by two solid acids: an amor- phous silica-alumina (SA) and a protonic zeolite BEA. Under air, the reaction can be represented by the following equation 1 2ArH + N:O4 + ~O2 ~ 2ArNO2 + H20 Though the reaction is catalysed by solid acids, the kinetic results do not agree with the 'classical' electrophilic aromatic substitution. The formation of an aromatic radical cation intermediate at the surface, stabilized by the acid strength of the catalyst, was suggested. According to this assumption, the rate-determining step of the reaction is the attack of the adsorbed radical cation by a nitrogen dioxide radical in the vapour phase. The initiation and the propagation of the catalysis would be provided by the formation of radical sites at the surface of the catalyst by abstraction of hydrogen atoms from hydroxyl groups by nitrogen dioxide radicals. Such a mechanism is shown in the following scheme. Catal-OH + NO2 ~ Catal-O + HNO: Catal-O. +ArH ~ Catal-O-,ArH Catal-O-, ArH + NO2 -~ Catal-O-, ArHNO~- Catal-O-,ArHNO~ ~ Catal-OH + ArNO2 ArH + NaO4 ---> ArNO2 + HNO2 It was also observed that addition of water to the feed had two opposite effects: over SA, water inhibited the nitration by competitive adsorption; over zeolite BEA, addition of water slightly increased the activity. In this work we studied the effects of the structure and the silicon-to- aluminium ratio of various aluminosilicates (silica-alumina and zeolites), on the catalytic activity and stability in the nitration of fluorobenzene. The sensitivity of the catalysts to added water and the regioselectivity (ortho, meta, para) were also examined. Such a study will permit not only the determination of the best catalyst for this reaction, but also will give additional information on the mechanism of the reaction and deactivation. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts The numbers, after the structure type code of zeolites, denote Si/A1 ratio. Faujasites and mordenites were commercial catalysts. FAU 2.5, the ammo- nium form of Linde type Y molecular sieve SK-41, was obtained from Alfa- A. Germain et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 136 (1996) 57-68 59 Products. FAU 2.5 (US), an ultra-stabilized Y zeolite with a large quantity of non-framework aluminium species, was a gift from Uetikon (reference: Z6-05- 01). FAU 15, an ultra-stabilized Y zeolite with a low non-framework aluminium content, was a gift from Zeocat (reference: ZF-515). MOR 5, the proton form of a small port mordenite, was obtained from SociEt6 Chimique de la Grande Paroisse (reference: Alite 180). MOR 6.9, a large port mordenite, was obtained from Norton (reference: Zeolon 100 H). MOR 11, MOR 49 and MOR 100, obtained by dealumination of MOR 5, were gifts from Zeocat (references: ZM-510, ZM-760 and ZM-980). MFI 35, an HZSM-5 zeolite, was a gift from M. Derewinski. Zeolite BEA 27 was synthesized in the presence of tetraethyl-ammonium hydroxide (TEAOH) according to the procedure described by Wadlinger et al. [14]. It appeared as spheroid crystals with sizes between 0.5 and 1 /,m. This solid was calcined at 450, then converted to the ammonium form by ion exchange in a 0.5 M solution of NH4NO3. SA, an amorphous silica-alumina containing 13 wt.-% alumina, was the commercial Ketjen catalyst. The chemical composition of the catalysts was determined by atomic absorp- tion analysis after dissolution of the sample (SCA-CNRS, Solaize, France). The crystallinity of zeolites was checked, before and after reaction, by X-ray powder diffraction on a CGR Theta 60 instrument using Cu Koz1 filtered radiation. Diffraction patterns showed a good crystallinity of the samples. The size and morphology of the crystals were determined by scanning electron microscopy. The micropore volume and BET surface area were deduced from the isotherms of adsorption of nitrogen at 77 K. Acidity measurements were carried out, as previously described [15], by stepwise thermal desorption (STD) of ammonia. The characteristics of the catalysts are reported in Table 1. 2.2. Procedure The reactions were performed in a fixed-bed continuous flow micro-reactor operating at atmospheric pressure. The catalyst (50 mg) was calcined at 500 (except BEA at 450) before use. Dinitrogen tetroxide (Air Liquide) and fluorobenzene (Fluka) were fed by passing the carrier gas (air) through 2 parallel saturators kept at 0 and 25, respectively. All the reactions were carried out in the same conditions: temperature = 160; space velocity = 24.4 h-l; partial pressure of dinitrogen tetroxide P(N204) = 31 Torr; partial pressure of fluo- robenzene P(C6HsF) = 27 Torr. When required, water (8.4 Tort) was added in the feed by way of a third saturator. The reactor effluent was analyzed on line by a gas chromatograph equipped with an apolar capillary column and a flame ionization detector. 60 A. Germain et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 136 (1996) 57-68 3. Results and discussion Except with the ultra-stabilized faujasite FAU 2.5 (US), only the mononi- trofluorobenzenes are obtained under the present conditions. The formation of para-isomer is predominant (87-91%), with a very low proportion of meta-iso- met ( < 0.5%). As previously noticed with silica-alumina [4], the variation of the activity of the catalysts as a function of time on stream occurs in two steps: an initial fast deactivation, followed by a pseudo-plateau. However, the rate and the duration of the first step is very dependent on the catalyst. This is illustrated in Fig. 1 by three typical examples. The comparison between the two mordenites (MOR 6.9 and MOR 49) reveals how the initially least active catalyst can become the most efficient, after one h on stream. As for BEA, it shows both the highest activity and the highest stability. In order to take into account the great variety of behaviour, we were interested in the activity of the fresh catalysts (v0) and the rate of the initial deactivation. These characteristics were determined by graphical application of the exponential decay law: In v = In vo - kdt, where v is the rate at time t and kd the rate constant of the initial deactivation. The results are given in Table 2. 3.1. Initial catalytic activities The effect of the aluminium content of the catalysts on the initial activity is reported in Fig. 2.

Nitration of fluorobenzene over typical catalysts as a function of time on stream (same conditions as Table 2), the aluminium content is observed. However, some comments can be already deduced from Fig. 2. Considering the faujasites, FAU 15 is less active than FAU 2.5. This is the result of the reduction of the number of active sites in the dealuminated zeolite. However, the turnover frequency is higher with FAU 15 than with FAU 2.5 (see Table 2). This is in agreement with the concept of the aluminium topological density proposed by Barthomeuf [17], that specifies that the dealumination increases the efficiency of the acid sites, until all the aluminium atoms become isolated. Concerning the ultra-stabilized faujasite, FAU 2.5 (US), it is known that the presence of non-framework aluminium species produces an enhance- ment of both acid strength [18] and activity in the hydrocarbon conversion reactions [19]. In fact, this catalyst is less active in nitration than the parent FAU 2.5. However, it must be pointed out that it is the only catalyst giving detectable amounts of 2,4-dinitro-fluorobenzene (ca. 10%). These results are explained by Table 2 Catalytic initial activities (v0), turnover frequencies (TOF) and deactivation constants (kd) for the nitration of fluorobenzene at 160 Catalyst v0 (10-6 mol s 1 g 1) TOF (initial) (h- 1) kd (10 6 s- 1) SA 15.0 21 170 FAU 2.5 19.0 15 127 FAU 2.5 (US) 12.0 9 293 FAU 15 7.7 27 16 MOR 5 4.9 7 81 MOR 6.9 35.0 68 500 MOR 11 15.0 40 490 MOR 49 12.0 130 37 MOR 100 17.5 380 77 MFI 35 6.2 47 7 BEA 27 48.7 360 9 Space velocity = 24.4 h- 1 ; P(C6 H5 F) = 27 Torr; P(N2 04) = 31 Torr. 62 A.

Logarithm of the initial activities as a function of the aluminium content of the cataysts. the blockage of pores by non-structural aluminium species. Since, the dinitration is difficult and results from two successive reactions, the formation of this product agrees with the presence of strong acid sites and resistance to diffusion of the mononitrated product. The variations of activities of mordenites are explained by similar phenom- ena. The activity of MOR 5 is very low. The turnover frequency of this catalyst is one tenth of the turnover frequency of MOR 6.9 (see Table 2). Such a difference in activity cannot be only the result of the reduction of the acid strength with the decrease in the Si/A1 ratio. In fact, MOR 5 is a 'small-port' mordenite in which structural defects introduce restrictions in the large channel of the zeolite [20]. So, internal diffusional limitations must certainly play a large part in the low activity of this zeolite. The pattern MOR 6.9 > MOR 11 > MOR 49 can be ascribed to the decrease in the number of acid sites. However, the turnover frequency, respectively 68, 40 and 130 h-1, shows a minimum for the intermediate zeolite. This anomaly can be explained by the fact that MOR 11 was obtained by dealumination of the 'small-port' MOR 5. Probably, the dealumination is not sufficient to achieve a complete unblocking of the porosity. In fact, MOR 5, MOR 11, MOR 49 and MOR 100, which are obtained by increasing dealumination of the same starting mordenite (MOR 5), display increasing turnover frequencies as shown Fig. 3. A better accessibility of the active sites can be invoked, because dealumination produces a secondary 4o/j 300 200 0 , ..... 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Si/A1 Fig. 3.

Logarithm of the initial activities as a function of the total acidity of the catalysts, determined by stepwise thermal desorption of ammonia. mesoporous system which generates interconnections between the main monodi- rectional channels of mordenites [21-23]. Zeolites with similar aluminium content, but with various structures such as BEA 27, MOR 49, MFI 35, show very different activities. The large variation of the turnover frequencies (360, 130 and 47 h-1, respectively) can not be explained by variation of the acid strength only. This sequence reflects the accessibility to the active sites, controlled by the pore structure and the size of the crystals. Thus, BEA is much more active than MOR because of its three dimensional pore structure and the smaller size of its crystals (see Table 1). MFI is the less active of these zeolites, owing to the smallest opening of its channels. As already notified by Parton et al. [24], bimolecular reactions are not favoured in pentasil zeolites. Fig. 4 shows the variation of the initial activity as a function of the acidity determined by thermal desorption of ammonia above 200. Such a representa- tion eliminates the aluminium centres which are inaccessible or not acid. If, within a family of solids, the activity increases with the number of acid sites, a large dependence on the structure of the catalyst must be notified. Mordenites are more active than faujasites. This is not due to the difference in accessibility because the pore opening is larger in faujasites than in mordenites, but is explained by the higher strength of the acid sites of mordenites [25]. Taking only the strongest acidity (determined by thermal desorption of ammonia above 350) into account, a good fit is obtained with FAU 2.5, FAU 15, MOR 6.9 and MOR 11 (Fig. 5). MOR 49 is out of this correlation, certainly because of its large dealumination. Whatever the representation, zeolite BEA is always far away from any correlation. The exceptional activity of this zeolite is certainly the result of the combination of many favourable properties: the appropriate size of pores and the three dimensional system of channels, the strength of the acid sites (at least as strong as those of mordenite [26]) and the high adsorption coefficient of the aromatic (five times higher than silica-alumina) associated with its hydrophobic 64 A.

Thus, zeolite BEA should be one of the optimum structures for substitutions in benzene derivatives. 3.2. Deactivation of the catalysts As given in Table 2, the rate of the first deactivation is largely dependent on the nature of the catalyst. Fig. 6 shows the variation of this rate of deactivation as a function of the initial activity. For a large number of catalysts a linear correlation is obtained: the more active the catalyst, the faster it deactivates. Such a result shows the role of the formation of products in the deactivation. The catalysts out of this correlation are: on the one hand, MOR 5, MOR 11, FAU 2.5 (US) and SA, the deactivation of which is faster than expected; on the other hand, BEA 27 which is one of the most stable catalysts while it is the most active. The positions of MOR 5, MOR 11 and FAU 2.5 (US) are explained by the blockage of pores by structural defects, or non- framework species, that favour subsequent reactions by diffusional limitation of the primary products.

Germain et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General I36 (1996) 57-68 65 the vapour-phase nitration of benzene by nitric acid over mordenites [12]. As for SA, its over-deactivation can be attributed to the adsorption of the produced water that is a poison of this catalyst [4]. Considering the low temperature of the reaction (160), the formation of coke (or polyaromatics) is improbable. The most likely reason of the deactiva- tion is certainly the strong adsorption of heavy products such as dinitrofluo- robenzenes. Confirmation of this assumption will be given by the addition of water reported in the next chapter. 3.3. Effect of water in the feed We previously noticed [4] that addition of water to the feed has two different effects on the activity of the catalysts: the reaction was inhibited by competitive adsorption over silica-alumina, whereas the reaction was improved over BEA. Moreover, Schumacher and Wang [6] had proposed to carry out the vapour-phase nitration process in presence of water ' which is believed necessary to create and renew reaction sites on the molecular sieve catalyst'. Thus, the action of water on the activity and on the stability of the catalysts, needed additional study. FAU 2.5, MOR 6.9, MOR 49, BEA 27 and silica-alumina were used for this work and water vapour (8.4 Torr) was added to the feed. Fig. 7 shows the influence of the addition of water on the initial rate. All the zeolites, whatever the Si/A1 ratio, exhibit an uniform increase of their activity L' 1 ( o~H2o)/Vo -- 1.3), whi e the activity of silica-alumina is decreased (V0(H20)/vo = 0.7). This last observation confirms the specific behaviour of this amorphous solid and is in agreement with its hydrophillic nature: the adsorption of water competes with the adsorption of the substrate, as observed in the kinetics [4]. In contrast, the reason for the increase in the initial rate on zeolites is not so obvious. However, according to the previously proposed mechanism [4], active radical centres would be generated by abstraction of hydrogen atoms from hydroxyl sites, by nitrogen dioxide radicals. Thus, only the Br0nsted acids of the ?~ BEA 27 ,'\" -10 MOR 6,9 ,,'\" MOR 4 -11 [./'/ ASA / \"~-~ ......... .9 Ln vo (Vo: tool. sec.'lg\"1) Fig. 7.

The initial action of water could be to convert the Lewis centres, generated during calcination, into Br~nsted sites. Fig. 8 shows the action of added water on deactivation. In all cases a stabilisation of the catalyst is obtained. With zeolites, the effect is even more important since the original deactivation is fast. The excess in the stabilisation of silica-alumina is attributable to the reduction of the activity of this catalyst in the presence of water. Previously, we had attributed the increase in activity when water is added over partially deactivated zeolite BEA, to a cleaning of the surface by 'steam distillation'. In order to confirm this assumption, we have carried out the following experiment. After 16 h on stream over FAU 2.5, water (8.4 Torr) was added to the feed. The conversion increased immediately, from 4.8% to 6.9%. This new value is comparable to the conversion (6.7%) observed after the same time on stream in the presence of water. Moreover, 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene is detected in the first analysis of the effluent after the addition of water, whereas this product is not detected in the absence of water or when the reaction is continuously carried out in the presence of water. Thus, the presence of water does not induce the formation of the dinitrated product, but the addition of water liberates the surface from a part of this compound accumulated when the catalyst was working without water addition. This experiment proves also that a part of the deactivation is the result of the formation and the adsorption of 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene. 3.4. Positional selectivity In all cases the formation of meta-nitrofluorobenzene is very low (< 0.5%). As shown in Fig. 9, the para isomer is predominant (between 87% and 91%). The variation of the para selectivity as a function of the nature of the catalyst is low and random: no relation between the para selectivity and the pore size of the catalysts can be detected. Moreover, the addition of water has no effect on the selectivity. Thus, the vapour phase nitration of fluorobenzene is insensitive to A. Germain et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 136 (1996) 57-68 67 92 90- .~ . ~ 88- 86 I,IIJlhlllll' Increasing pore size Fig. 9, Para-selectivity in the nitration of fluorobenzene. (w): reaction in the presence of water. the shape selectivity. It must be mentioned that this reaction is irreversible [4]: the shape selectivity could only occur at the transition state. As the fluorine atom is not a large substituent, the difference of volume between the para and the ortho substitution is certainly insufficient to induce shape selectivity. Fur- thermore, the fluorine atom is a high para-selective substituent. The liquid phase nitration of fluorobenzene, using a mixture of nitric and sulfuric acids at 25, gives an o/m/p ratio equal to 86/0.6/13. Thus, whatever the catalyst, the high para-selectivity of the reaction is certainly governed by the electronic factors of the substituent. 4. Conclusion The various solid acid catalysts used in the vapour phase nitration of fluorobenzene displayed large differences in activity and stability. If the activity is partially determined by the acidity of the active sites, it is highly influenced by steric factors leading to limitations in the internal diffusivity of the reactants or in the formation of the transition state. The deactivation, that generally increased with the activity, is due, in a large part, to the accumulation of dinitrated products. Except over silica-alumina, added water has been proved to be beneficial with regard to the catalyst activity and stability. 'Steam-distilla- tion' of non-volatile dinitroaromatics is invoked. The specific behaviour of silica-alumina is interpreted by its strong hydrophilicity: the adsorption of water competes with the adsorption of the reactants. Zeolite BEA is, by far, the best catalyst of those studied here. Its highest activity and stability can be explained by its small particle size and its appropriate structure for this aromatic substitution. A phenomenon close to the 'lock-and-key' model for enzyme catalysis, in accordance with the 'inverse shape selectivity' defined by Santilli et al. [27], can be invoked. 68 A.

The vapour-phase nitration of fluorobenzene with dinitrogen tetroxide has been investigated over amorphous silica-alumina and zeolites with various structures and aluminium contents. The activity of the catalysts increases with the number and the strength of the acid sites, but is also very dependent on the accessibility controlled by the pore structure and the size of the crystals. Except, the zeolite BEA which is the most active and the most stable, the deactivation of the catalysts is fast since the activity is high. The addition of water to the feed increases the activity and the stability of all the zeolites, but decreases the activity of amorphous silica-alumina. A large part of deactivation is attributed to the marginal formation of 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene which stays on the surface of the catalyst, but can be eliminated by ‘steam distillation’. No evidence of shape selectivity was obtained. Zeolite BEA proved to be a remarkably efficient catalyst.
