Unusual CH4 dry reforming performance over Ni-based catalyst separated from nickel metal hydride battery waste Tomohiro Kanamori Motohide Matsuda Michihiro Miyake ⁎ Department of Environmental Chemistry and Materials, Okayama University, 3-1-1 Tsushima-Naka, Okayama 700-8530, Japan ⁎ Corresponding author. Tel.: +81 862518906; fax: +81 862518906. The Ni-based compound (s-NiO) has been successfully separated from nickel metal hydride battery waste by a series of acid and base treatments. The catalytic activity of s-NiO reduced to Ni metal was investigated for the CH4 dry reforming at 780°C. It was found that the CH4 conversion over s-NiO was superior to that over regent NiO (r-NiO) and exhibited an unusual behavior. The differences of catalytic activities between s-NiO and r-NiO were examined in terms of carbon deposition and the sinterability of the samples. Carbon deposited by side reactions prevented Ni particles from sintering, and Ni fine particles were highly dispersed on the deposited carbon in the sample obtained from s-NiO. Keywords CH4 dry reforming Nickel metal hydride battery Resource recovery 1 Introduction Over the last few decades, great attention has been paid to the CH4 dry reforming (1) from the perspective of the effective utilization of CO2 in flue gas and CH4 in natural gas. Burning natural gas provides cleaner energy, compared to burning oil and coal since it contains less NO x and no SO x . The CH4 dry reforming produces synthesis gas with lower H2/CO ratio, which is more suitable for industrial methanol synthesis, oxo-synthesis [1] and so on, than the steam reforming (2): (1) CH4 +CO2 →2H2 +2CO,H2/CO=1 (2) CH4 +H2O→3H2 +CO,H2/CO=3 It has been reported that supported noble metal catalysts (Pt, Rh and Ru) had good catalytic performance [2–11]. It is, however, desired to use cheaper metals, taking account of economics and utilization in large-scale processes. Thus supported Ni-based oxides [12–15] and lanthanoid perovskite-type oxides [16–19] are expected to be alternative catalysts for this reaction. In the battery field, nickel metal hydride (Ni-MH) batteries with high power and rechargeable features have been developed and are now widely used as power sources of cell phones, digital cameras, hybrid cars and so on. On the other hand, hundreds of tonnes of Ni-MH waste have been disposed of, even though they contain valuable transition and rare-earth elements. From the viewpoint of establishing a resource recycling-oriented society, it is desirable and very important to study the resource recovery of the Ni-MH waste. It is expected that Ni-based compound separated from Ni-MH waste can be used as a catalyst of the CH4 dry reforming, since Ni-MH waste contains Ni as a main element. Because the Ni-based compound is reduced to Ni metal during the CH4 dry reforming, it is also expected that the resulting Ni metal can be reused as a raw material of nickel metal hydride batteries. In our previous study, single-phase Ni-, Ce- and La-based oxides were successfully obtained from Ni-MH waste by an environmentally gentle way, and their catalytic activities for the CH4 dry reforming were tested [Environ. Sci. Technol., submitted]. Consequently, Ni-based oxide was reduced to Ni metal, and Ni metal exhibited the highest catalytic activity and stability for the CH4 dry reforming. In the present study, we report the unusual CH4 dry reforming properties of the separated NiO (s-NiO), compared to regent NiO (r-NiO). In addition, the differences of catalytic performance between s-NiO and r-NiO are discussed from the aspects of carbon deposition and sinterability of the samples. 2 Experimental 2.1 Sample preparation and characterization Ni-MH waste used here was collected from the crucible for producing Ni-MH battery provided from Mitsui Mining and Smelting Co. Ltd., Japan. In our previous study, Ni-based compound was successfully separated from Ni-MH waste by a series of acid and base treatments [Environ. Sci. Technol., submitted]. Namely, Ni-MH waste of 10g was dissolved with 2M (mol/dm3) HCl solution of 200ml for 24h. Then, the dissolved transition and rare-earth metal ions were precipitated at pH 12 with 2M NaOH solution. The Ni component was extracted from this precipitate by treating with 7.5M NH3 aq. of 200ml, through forming a Ni-ammonium complex. After filtration, the purple filtrate was heated around 60°C to decompose the Ni-ammonium complex and to obtain Ni(OH)2. The sample, s-NiO, was obtained by calcination of the resulting Ni(OH)2 at 1000°C. The samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD; Rigaku RINT2100/PC) with monochromated Cu Kα radiation. Morphologies and component images of the samples after the CH4 dry reforming reaction were observed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM; JEOL JSM-6380). Energy dispersive spectroscope (EDS; JEOL EX-54175JMU) and inductively coupled plasma (ICP; Seiko Instruments SPS-7700) were used for chemical composition analysis of the samples. The specific surface areas of the samples were evaluated from measured isothermal adsorption for N2 at 77K based on the BET method (BEL-Japan BELSORP 18 PLUS). Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TG; Rigaku TG 8120) was carried out to estimate the amounts of carbon deposited over the samples. 2.2 Catalytic activity The CH4 dry reforming reaction was performed in a vertical fixed-bed reactor consisting of a quartz tube with Ø12mm in internal diameter under the atmospheric pressure. The thermocouple was inserted from the bottom of the quartz tube, and glass wool was set on it. One gram of s-NiO powder was held in place by glass wool without pre-reduction in order to reduce s-NiO to Ni metal by using the CH4 dry reforming and to reuse the resulting Ni metal as a raw material of nickel metal hydride batteries. The reaction was carried out at 780°C. The fed gas ratio was CH4/CO2 =1:1 at a flow rate of 50ml/min. The catalytic activities were also tested by changing the CH4/CO2 ratio into 1:1.5 at the same flow rate. In order to compare the differences of catalytic activities and morphologies, we also tested r-NiO (Kanto 99.9%) under the same condition. The vent gas was cooled with an ice-cooler to remove water produced by side reactions. The gaseous products were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-8A) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of s-NiO separated from Ni-MH waste The XRD pattern of s-NiO separated from Ni-MH waste was identified as a single-phase NiO. The ICP analysis revealed that the elemental compositions of s-NiO were Ni:Co:La=97.4:2.0:0.6 (mole ratio). Fig. 1 shows the morphologies of s-NiO and r-NiO. The particles of s-NiO were larger than those of r-NiO, whose sizes were estimated to be ca. 1μm, because primary particles of s-NiO looked more sintered, compared with those of r-NiO. This may be due to the existence of Co component in s-NiO. The specific surface areas of s-NiO and r-NiO were measured to be 7.1 and 1.8m2/g, respectively. The reason why the specific surface area of s-NiO was larger, even though it had larger particle sizes, could be explained by the difference of porosity, namely, conglomeration of s-NiO seemed more porous than that of r-NiO; compare between Fig. 1a and b. 3.2 Catalytic performances In order to examine the influences of elements in s-NiO for the CH4 dry reforming, we prepared Co- and La-added r-NiO. The CH4 conversion of those samples were compared. La-added r-NiO exhibited higher CH4 conversion than Co-added r-NiO, and maintained a steady value. Fig. 2 shows the CH4 conversions over s-NiO and r-NiO with CH4/CO2 =1:1. The CH4 conversion over s-NiO exhibited higher values than that over r-NiO, and its behavior was quite different from that of r-NiO. With regard to r-NiO, the CH4 conversion monotonously decreased with reaction time, and was lowered to ca. 67% after 24h reaction. On the other hand, the CH4 conversion over s-NiO decreased at the beginning (0.5–4h), and then increased (4–24h). On the contrary, the H2 and CO selectivity over s-NiO decreased after 4h reaction, as shown in Fig. 3 . This indicates that reaction (3) shifts to reaction (5), which is a production reaction of carbon and water. Reaction (5) can be obtained by combining reactions (6)–(8): (3) CH4 +CO2 →2H2 +2CO (4) CH4 +H2O→3H2 +CO (5) CH4 +CO2 →2C+2H2O (6) CH4 →C+2H2 (7) CO2 +H2 →CO+H2O (8) CO+H2 →H2O+C (9) C+CO2 →2CO In order to restrain the production of carbon, we changed the CH4/CO2 ratio from 1:1 to 1:1.5. By changing the fed gas ratio, we expected that the carbon deposition by reaction (6) would decrease and the deposited carbon would be consumed by reaction (9). In our pre-experiment, however, the CH4 conversion decreased and no improvements in H2 and CO selectivity were provided when the fed gas ratio of CH4/CO2 =1:1.5 was used from the beginning of the reaction. Therefore, the fed gas ratio was changed from CH4/CO2 =1:1–1:1.5 after 4h of reaction, as mentioned below. Fig. 4a and b shows the CH4 and CO2 conversions and H2 and CO selectivity over s-NiO, respectively. Compared to the result shown in Fig. 2, the CH4 conversion rapidly increased just after changing the CH4/CO2 from 1:1 to 1:1.5, and then showed a steady value. In addition, both the H2 and the CO selectivity also showed steady values. This indicated that the production reaction (5) of carbon and water was restrained and that the CH4 dry reforming reaction (3) proceeded. 3.3 Carbon deposition over the samples Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns of s-NiO and r-NiO after the reactions. NiO was reduced to Ni within 30min from the beginning of the reaction, because the XRD patterns of the samples after 30min of reaction revealed only the Ni phase. The reduction of NiO to Ni made an enhancement of the CH4 conversions over the samples after 30min of reaction. With regard to s-NiO, as shown in Fig. 5a and b, the XRD peaks identified as carbon (graphite) appeared in addition to those based on Ni phase after 24h of reaction. According to the TG analysis, the amount of deposited carbon was found to be reduced to one-fourth when the CH4/CO2 was changed from 1:1 to 1:1.5. Moreover, the parabolic behavior of the CH4 conversion, as shown in Fig. 2, was considered to have something to do with the carbon deposition, since no peaks due to carbon were detected on the XRD pattern of r-NiO. Fig. 6 shows SEM micrographs of s-NiO and r-NiO after 24h of reaction with CH4/CO2 =1:1. The resulting Ni from r-NiO was sintered and the grain growth was observed, as shown in Fig. 6b. In general, sintering of the catalyst particles causes deactivation [20–22]. Therefore, the reason why the CH4 conversion over r-NiO was lowered with reaction time, as shown in Fig. 2, was tentatively attributed to the sintering of Ni metal particles. On the other hand, fine particles with ca. 0.8μm in size, shown in Fig. 6a, looked to be dispersed on comparatively large particles. The EDS analysis revealed that the fine particles and comparatively large particles were Ni metal and deposited carbon, respectively. In addition, the morphology of s-NiO after 4h of reaction, where the CH4 conversion attained a minimum, was compared to that after 24h of reaction by component (COMPO) image observation. Fig. 7 shows COMPO images of the sample's surfaces shaped into pellets under 20MPa. In these figures, the Ni metal particles and deposited carbons appeared as white and dark parts, respectively. The mean particle size of Ni metal after 4h of reaction was estimated to be ca. 2.0μm, and then that of Ni metal turned into smaller after 24h of reaction, i.e., ca. 0.8μm. This suggests the following mechanism on the disaggregation of Ni particles by carbon deposition with reaction time, as shown in Fig. 8 : 1. s-NiO is reduced to Ni metal within ca. 30min, where the CH4 conversion reaches ca. 89%. 2. Carbon deposition and Ni metal sintering simultaneously occur, and the CH4 conversion begins to decrease. 3. The degree of Ni metal sintering increases to a maximum at around 4h, where the CH4 conversion attains a minimum of ca. 76%. 4. Sintered Ni metal particles are broken into small parts by carbon, which is deposited at grain boundaries among Ni metal particles, and the CH4 conversion begins to increase. 5. Disaggregated Ni metal fine particles are highly dispersed on the deposited carbon, and then the CH4 conversion reaches ca. 93% after 24h of reaction. The disaggregation of Ni particles by carbon deposition occurred in the presence of La, which was impurity component of s-NiO. Further studies are in progress in order to comprehend the effect of the impurity components in s-NiO on the catalytic performance. 4 Conclusions The CH4 dry reforming catalytic properties were examined over the Ni-based compound separated from Ni-MH waste. The obtained s-NiO was identified as a single-phase NiO containing Co and La. The CH4 conversion over the resulting Ni from s-NiO exhibited unusual behavior and was superior to that over r-NiO. According to the COMPO images of s-NiO after the reaction, the resulting Ni metal particles seemed to be highly dispersed on the deposited carbon. On the other hand, no carbon deposition was observed in the case of r-NiO, and the resulting Ni metal was sintered. This was considered to result in the difference of the CH4 conversion between s-NiO and r-NiO. The parabolic behavior of the CH4 conversion over s-NiO with CH4/CO2 =1:1 was explained by the reduction of s-NiO and the carbon deposition as follows. At first, s-NiO was reduced to Ni metal within 30min, and Ni metal was sintered in parallel with carbon deposition by side reactions that occur up to ca. 4h of reaction. Then sintered Ni metal was disaggregated to the fine particles by the deposited carbon, and the fine particles were highly dispersed on the carbon. Namely, the deposited carbon, which is known as an inhibitor depressing the CH4 dry reforming, prevented the resulting Ni metal particles from sintering, and performed a role of support for the Ni metal fine particles. When the CH4/CO2 was changed from 1:1 to 1:1.5 after 4h of reaction, carbon deposition by side reactions were restrained afterward.
