The catalytic activity and selectivity depended strongly on the noble metals used. Rh/WO 3 -ZrO 2 gave the highest conversion of ethylene, whereas Ru/WO 3 -ZrO 2 was almost inactive. The higher catalytic activity was attributed to a better metal dispersion. Pd/WO 3 -ZrO 2 gave the highest selectivity for acetic acid (75%), with the selectivity of the other two catalysts being rather low (~10%). Temperature-programmed oxidation and H 2 reduction experiments were used to show that the strength of the noble metal–oxygen bond played an important role in product distribution. A weak metal–oxygen bond favored the formation of acetic acid, while a strong metal–oxygen bond favored the combustion of ethylene to CO x . Key words: ethylene; oxidation; acetic acid; tungstated zirconia; palladium; ruthenium; rhodium Acetic acid is one of the most important intermediates in the chemical industry. There are several processes for acetic acid production, such as methanol carbonylation, acetaldehyde oxidation, hydrocarbon (n-butane, naphtha) oxidation, and ethylene direct oxidation. The latter is attracting increasing interest because of its eco-friendly nature and low capital costs [1]. Many catalysts, including Pd-Cr 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 [2] and Pd-V 2 O 5 -Sb 2 O 5 /Al 2 O 3 [3], have been used for this reaction. The Pd-H 4 SiW 12 O 40 /SiO 2 catalyst, which was commercialized in 1997, has the highest acetic acid yield among the catalysts used [1]. The common feature of these catalysts is that they are bifunctional and consist of a highly dispersed metal and an acidic support. However, heteropolyacids are not stable at high temperatures and pressures or under a redox atmosphere. Thus, much effort has been devoted to identifying a better support with high stability and suitable acidity. Recently, many researchers have focused on WO 3 -ZrO 2 catalysts because of their high thermal stability and strong acidity [4,5]. In particular, WO 3 -ZrO 2 exhibits high catalytic activity for a variety of reactions, such as alkane isomerization [6,7], alcohol dehydration [8], gas-phase hydration of ethylene [9], esterification, and trans-esterification [10]. These investi- gations revealed that the WO 3 -ZrO 2 catalysts have excellent catalytic properties because of their strong Brønsted acid sites [11]. The high stability of WO 3 -ZrO 2 catalysts under both reducing and oxidizing conditions makes them advantageous over heteropolyacids for practical applications [12]. Thus, WO 3 -ZrO 2 has attracted much attention as a support for palla- dium catalysts for the direct oxidation of ethylene to acetic acid [13–15]. In previous studies [16,17], we have found that Pd had a positive effect when Pd/WO 3 -ZrO 2 catalysts were used. It was also found that Brønsted acid sites related to polytungstate species were responsible for the catalytic activity. Previous attention has primarily focused on palladium, while there has been almost no reports on the direct oxidation of ethylene over other metals supported on solid acids. To explore other precious metals as possible alternatives to palladium, we have developed new Ru/WO 3 -ZrO 2 and Rh/WO 3 -ZrO 2 cata- lysts along the same lines as was used for palladium. In the present study, NM/WO 3 -ZrO 2 (NM = Ru, Rh, and Pd) catalysts WANG Lixia et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(12): 1281–1286 were prepared with different noble metals and characterized using N 2 adsorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier trans- form infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) of pyridine adsorption, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), and tempera- ture-programmed oxidation (TPO). Activity tests were carried out to evaluate the catalytic activity of these catalysts. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation WO 3 -ZrO 2 samples with a W/Zr ratio of 0.2 were prepared by impregnation using Zr(OH) 4 as the support and ammonium metatungstate as the tungsten precursor. Zr(OH) 4 was obtained by the hydrolysis of zirconium oxychloride with the addition of aqueous ammonium hydroxide to pH 9.6. The precipitate ob- tained was washed with deionized water until free from chlo- ride and dried at 110 °C overnight. The dried hydroxide was impregnated with aqueous ammonium metatungstate (NH 4 ) 6 H 2 W 12 O 40 �xH 2 O, the water was evaporated, and the sample was dried overnight at 110 °C. Then the sample was heated to 800 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min and calcined in air for 3 h in a furnace. The obtained WO 3 -ZrO 2 sample was denoted WZ. NM/WZ (NM = Ru, Rh, and Pd) catalysts were prepared using a previously reported procedure [13]. The preparation involved impregnating WO 3 -ZrO 2 with an aqueous solution (40 mmol/ml) of noble metal precursors (PdCl 2 , RhCl 3 �nH 2 O, or RuCl 3 �nH 2 O). The loading was 1.0 wt%. After drying at 100 °C, the resulting solids were calcined at 400 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min in air for 5 h. The Ru/WZ catalyst was calcined using the same procedure under a N 2 atmosphere to prevent the loss of Ru due to the formation of volatile RuO 4 in air. 1.2 Catalyst characterization The specific surface area and pore size distribution of the catalysts were measured by nitrogen adsorption/desorption at –196 °C using a Counter Omnisorp-100CX system. Samples were first degassed at 350 °C under high vacuum (1.33 u10 –4 Pa) for 3 h before isotherms were recorded. XRD patterns were recorded with a Rigaku D/Max-2500 diffractometer using Cu K . radiation ( = 0.1542 nm) in the 2 T range 10°–90° at a scan rate of 0.02°/s at 40 kV and 200 mA. FT-IR spectra of pyridine adsorption were recorded on a Nicolet 410 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with an IR cell containing CaF 2 windows. The nature of the acid sites was characterized using pyridine as a probe molecule. Prior to each experiment, the sample was pretreated at 360 °C in vacuum and then exposed to pyridine vapor for 10 min at room temperature. The pre-treated sample was degassed and the spectra were recorded at 150 °C. Noble metal dispersion was measured by H 2 pulse adsorp- tion using an Autosorb-1/C system at 40 °C. In a typical ex- periment, the sample was first pretreated in He flow at 400 °C for 2 h and subsequently reduced in H 2 gas at 300 °C for 1 h. Then hydrogen was purged from the system by evacuation for 2 h. The adsorption isotherm was established by measuring the amount of H 2 adsorbed as a function of pressure at 40 °C. TPO was performed using a Micromeritics AutoChem-2920 system. In a typical experiment, 50 mg of sample was reduced in flowing H 2 at 300 °C for 1 h and then cooled to 50 °C. The sample was purged with He at 50 °C until the TCD (thermal conductivity detector) baseline was stable. The rate of oxygen consumption in a mixture of 5% O 2 /He for a temperature in- crease from 50 to 800 °C at 10 °C/min was detected by TCD and recorded as the TPO profile of the catalyst. TPR was carried out on freshly prepared catalysts to identify reducible species present on the catalyst surface. The analysis was conducted on a Micromeritics AutoChem-2920 system. In a typical experiment, 50 mg of sample was purged with flow- ing Ar at 100 °C for 1 h and cooled to 50 °C. The temperature was then increased from 50 to 800 °C at 10 °C/min in a mixture of 10% H 2 /Ar. The rate of hydrogen consumption was detected by TCD and recorded as the TPR profile of the catalyst. 1.3 Catalytic activity The oxidation of ethylene was performed in a fixed-bed flow reactor (stainless steel, 10-mm i.d.). A 2 cm 3 sample of the catalyst (~3.6 g, 40–60 mesh) was placed in the reactor and pretreated at 300 °C for 1 h under a stream of 50% H 2 -He at a flow rate of 60 cm 3 /min. After cooling under a He flow to the reaction temperature of 150 °C, a mixture of the reactant gas (C 2 H 4 /O 2 /H 2 O/He, 50:7:30:13, v/v) was fed into the reactor at a flow rate of 100 cm 3 /min (SV = 3000 h –1 ) and pressure of 0.6 MPa. A trap filled with water cooled with ice-water ( a0 °C) was used to collect the liquid products, which were analyzed by GC (Agilent 6890) using an FFAP column with a flame ioni- zation detector. Gaseous compounds were analyzed by online GC with TCD using a Porapak Q column. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Effect of noble metals on catalytic activity Table 1 shows the activity of NM/WZ catalysts with dif- ferent noble metals for the direct oxidation of ethylene to acetic acid. The Rh/WZ catalyst yielded the highest conversion of ethylene, while Ru/WZ was almost inactive for the reaction. Large differences were observed among the three catalysts for the selectivity for acetic acid. The selectivity increased in the order Rh/WZ<Ru/WZ<Pd/WZ. The results indicated that the product distribution strongly depended on the noble metal. The Pd/WZ catalyst had a high selectivity for acetic acid (75%). WANG Lixia et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(12): 1281–1286 Although the Rh/WZ catalyst had the highest ethylene con- version, it was selective for the combustion reactions and converted most of the ethylene to CO 2 . For the Ru/WZ catalyst with the lowest activity, a relatively high amount of acetalde- hyde (41%) was obtained. The results demonstrated that for the selective oxidation of ethylene to acetic acid, the loading of different metals on the acidic support had a large influence on the catalytic activity, and Pd was the most suitable for the production of acetic acid. 2.2 Characterization of the NM/WZ catalysts 2.2.1 XRD results XRD patterns of the NM/WZ catalysts with different noble metals are shown in Fig. 1. Characteristic peaks for the stable monoclinic phase of zirconia (2 T = 28.2° and 31.5°) and the metastable tetragonal zirconia (2 T = 30.2°) were observed, with tetragonal zirconia being dominant. The tetragonal phase is considered essential for highly active acid catalysts [18]. The formation of monoclinic WO 3 microcrystallites (2 T range 23°–25°) as a result of the agglomeration of surface WO x spe- cies [19] was also observed by XRD. There was no obvious peak corresponding to the noble metals or their oxides. How- ever, we cannot exclude the existence of large noble metal oxide crystallites because their characteristic peaks could be covered by the peaks of ZrO 2 (2 = 32°–36 o ). The XRD pat- terns for the three catalysts were almost the same, which sug- gested that the supported noble metal did not influence the crystal structure of the support. 2.2.2 FT-IR results The acidity of the NM/WZ samples was investigated using pyridine adsorption/desorption, which was followed by FT-IR spectroscopy. Figure 2 shows IR spectra for the desorption of pyridine at 150 °C. All samples exhibited bands at 1450 and 1540 cm –1 corresponding to Lewis and Brønsted acid sites, respectively. Interestingly, the concentration of Brønsted or Lewis acid sites determined from the intensity of these peaks [20] was almost the same for all the samples. This indicated that the particular noble metal on the WZ support had almost no influence on the number of Brønsted or Lewis acid sites. Combined with the XRD results, these findings led us to conclude that the noble metal in NM/WZ had no appreciable influence on either the crystal structure or the acidity of the catalysts. 2.2.3 H 2 pulse adsorption results Table 2 shows the surface area and noble metal dispersion of the catalysts. No difference in surface area was observed for the Rh/WZ and Ru/WZ samples, whereas the surface area of Pd/WZ was slightly less than that of the other samples. How- ever, the dispersion varied with the noble metal.

After calcination at high temperature, poor Ru dispersion is generally observed [21]. The catalytic activity exhibited the same trend as the dispersion of the noble metals, namely, Rh/WZ > Pd/WZ > Ru/WZ. Therefore, we conclude that a high catalyst activity for the oxidation of ethylene required a high metal dispersion on the catalyst. It has been reported that an increase in activity was observed for a decrease in the size of the metal oxide crystallites [22,23]. Our result is in agreement with this. Thus, the noble metal dispersion played an important role in the catalytic activity for the direct oxidation of ethylene to acetic acid, that is, the higher the metal dispersion, the higher the conversion of ethylene. 2.2.4 TPO results TPO profiles of the samples pretreated in H 2 at 300 °C are shown in Fig. 3. The peaks at ca. 73°C corresponded to the oxidation of the noble metals reduced in the pretreatment. The noble metals were easily oxidized on the WZ support, which is consistent with literature results [21,24]. Interestingly, the TPO profile of Pd/WZ contained a negative peak centered at 700 °C, which may be due to the decomposition of PdO [24]. However, no peaks corresponding to the decomposition of Rh 2 O 3 and RuO x were observed below 800 °C. According to the literature [21], the decomposition peaks of Rh 2 O 3 are at 800–1000 °C, whereas RuO x decomposition occurs at >1000 °C. Thus, we deduced that the bond strength for the metal oxides increases in the order Pd–O < Rh–O < Ru–O, which is in good agreement with literature results [25–27]. Fig. 4 shows H 2 -TPR profiles of the three catalysts. The TPR spectrum of Rh/WZ exhibited a peak at 89 °C with a shoulder at 117 °C that were due to the reduction of Rh 2 O 3 with different interactions with the support [28,29]. For Pd/WZ there was a negative peak at 60 °C that is characteristic of the decomposi- tion of the E-PdH phase [30]. The presence of E-PdH revealed that the Pd oxides were easily reduced to metallic Pd [31]. RuO x was the most difficult to reduce among the three noble metal oxides. The TPR profile of Ru/WZ showed a large peak at 140 °C related to the reduction of RuO x [32,3]. The higher reduction temperature for RuO x than for PdO and Rh 2 O 3 is related to the strength of the NM–O bond. The H 2 -TPR results indicated that the strength of the metal–oxygen bond increased in the order Pd–O < Rh–O < Ru–O, which is consistent with the TPO results. It is widely accepted that the oxidation of ethylene to acetic acid proceeds by the formation of acetaldehyde as an interme- diate. This is then oxidized to acetic acid [14,15]. Based on the results in Table 1, it can be suggested that a weak metal–oxygen bond favored the formation of acetic acid by the easy insertion of an oxygen atom into ethylene and/or acetal- dehyde. As a result, the Pd/WZ catalyst with a weak Pd–O bond exhibited 75% selectivity for acetic acid, whereas the Rh/WZ and Ru/WZ catalysts with strong metal–oxygen bonds showed acetic acid selectivity of only 11% and 12%, respec- tively. It is interesting that the Rh/WZ and Ru/WZ catalysts produced significant amounts of CO 2 , which may be due to their stronger metal–oxygen bond. It is known that oxygen is more readily adsorbed on the surfaces of metals with strong metal–oxygen bonds [21,34]. It has also been reported that these adsorbed oxygen species promote the oxidation of light hydrocarbons to CO and CO 2 [35,36], which is consistent with our finding that the Rh/WZ and Ru/WZ catalysts with a strong metal–oxygen bond showed high selectivity for CO 2 . However, there seemed a discrepancy with the CO 2 selectivity of the Rh/WZ and Ru/WZ catalysts: Ru/WZ with a stronger NM–O bond exhibited a lower selectivity than the Rh/WZ catalyst. This was not surprising when the rather poor Ru dispersion (1.4%) compared with the Ru/WZ catalyst was considered, which had a negative influence on the adsorption of oxygen on the catalyst and led to a lower CO 2 selectivity. From the above it can be concluded that the strength of the NM–O bond is responsible for the product distribution in the direct oxidation of ethylene to acetic acid. 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 Ru/WZ Pd/WZ Temperature ( o C) Rh/WZ In te n s ity Fig. 3.

The Rh/WZ catalyst showed a consid- erably higher conversion of ethylene than the other two cata- lysts. The differences in the activity were related to the dif- ferences in metal dispersion. TPO and H 2 -TPR profiles for the catalysts revealed that the strength of the NM–O bond in- creased in the order Pd–O < Rh–O < Ru–O. The comparison of the product distributions from the catalysts revealed that a weak metal–oxygen bond favored the formation of acetic acid by the insertion of an oxygen atom into ethylene and/or acet- aldehyde, whereas a strong metal–oxygen bond favored the combustion of ethylene to CO x . The Pd/WZ catalyst with a high metal dispersion and a weak palladium–oxygen interac- tion was the optimum for a high acetic acid yield. References 1 Sano K, Uchida H, Wakabayashi S.

The catalytic activity and selectivity depended strongly on the noble metals used. Rh/WO3-ZrO2 gave the highest conversion of ethylene, whereas Ru/WO3-ZrO2 was almost inactive. The higher catalytic activity was attributed to a better metal dispersion. Pd/WO3-ZrO2 gave the highest selectivity for acetic acid (75%), with the selectivity of the other two catalysts being rather low (∼10%). Temperature-programmed oxidation and H2 reduction experiments were used to show that the strength of the noble metal–oxygen bond played an important role in product distribution. A weak metal–oxygen bond favored the formation of acetic acid, while a strong metal–oxygen bond favored the combustion of ethylene to CO x .
