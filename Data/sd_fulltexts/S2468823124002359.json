A series of Zn-doped nano-Cr2O3 catalysts were prepared by the microwave-assisted combustion method, and the catalysts were successfully applied to the fluorination of 1, 1, 2, 3-tetrachloropropene to synthesize 2-chloro-3, 3, 3-trifluoropropene, and the fluorination of vinylidene chloride to vinylidene fluoride using anhydrous hydrogen fluoride, which is much more efficient than catalyst reported in literatures. By XRD, XPS, and NH3-TPD, it was confirmed that the doping of a small amount of Zn did not have a great influence on the crystal structure of the catalyst but had a great influence on the acidity of the catalyst surface, which increased the number of weak acids and medium acids on the catalyst surface. In addition, the addition of a small amount of Zn could increase the content of high-valent chromium and produce more CrOxFy active centers. As the number of acid sites increases, it provides adsorption centers for chlorine-containing molecules, and the increase of CrOxFy active centers promotes the reaction. They work together to improve the catalytic performance of the catalyst.

Organic fluoride has special qualities that make it useful in a variety of applications, including coatings, plastic products, chemical extinguishing agents, and refrigerants [1–11]. More significantly, because HFOs has a low ozone depletion potential (ODP) and global warming potential (GWP), as well as its short lifetime in the air, it will not cause great damage to the ozone layer in the atmosphere, becoming the most important substitute for refrigerant R-22 [12–13]. In order to prepare HFOs, gas-phase fluorination using anhydrous hydrogen fluoride is a crucial step. The majority of research on fluorination catalysts focuses on increasing activity and lifetime. Currently, chromium-based catalysts are primarily used in industrial settings. However, because chromium is expensive and can have detrimental effects on human health and the environment, it is crucial to investigate cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and efficient fluorination catalysts and develop gas-phase fluorination catalysts that do not contain chromium in order to prevent environmental pollution caused by chromium and its compounds. Cr2O3 is widely used as a catalyst for fluorination or the Cl / F exchange reaction. At the same time, Cr2O3 can also be used in lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitor electrodes, sensors, and combustion catalysts. In particular, nano-Cr2O3 materials with various morphologies, such as columnar and pancake Cr2O3, hollow micro / nano hexagonal particles, flake, one-dimensional nanostructure, and three-dimensional structure, have attracted more and more attention. According to Kemnitz [14], nano-metal fluoride is an excellent catalyst for reactions including fluorination or the Cl / F exchange reaction, with a better specific surface area and Lewis acidity. Astruc [15] synthesized chromium oxalate with different morphologies by reacting CrCl3 with ammonium oxalate in different organic solvents. When chromium oxalate is treated in air at 350 °C, Cr2O3 polyhedra, platelets, spheres, and needles will be formed. The catalyst composed of polyhedral particles and flaky particles has higher activity than spherical and acicular particles. By controlling the hydrolysis and calcination of urea in chromium solution, Cr2O3 with micropores was obtained, which has high activity for fluorinating CH2Cl2 [16]. Jia prepared a series of ZnO/Cr2O3 catalysts by an impregnation method and investigated the promoted role of ZnO on the activity for selective dehydrofluorination of 1, 1, 1, 3, 3-pentafluoropropane to tetrafluoropropylene and 3, 3, 3-trifluoropropyne [17]. In addition, a series of NiF2 /AlF3 catalysts were prepared, and the pyrolysis of 1, 1, 1, 2-tetrafluoroethane was tested. The influence of catalyst acid sites on the reaction was studied, and it was found that excessively strong acid sites result in serious carbon deposition on the catalysts and thus drastic deactivation [18]. Our research group has reported that a series of Cr2O3 catalysts doped with different metals such as Al, Zn, and Co were prepared by the traditional coprecipitation method, and the prepared catalysts were used to catalyze the synthesis of trans-1-chloro-3, 3, 3-trifluoropropene by gas phase fluorination of 1, 1, 3, 3- tetrachloropropene with HF. The effects of different metal doping on the catalytic performance of the catalysts were studied, and excellent yields were obtained (>98 %). On this basis, nano-Cr2O3 and zinc-doped nano-Cr2O3 catalysts with different contents were prepared by microwave-assisted combustion (SCS) in this contribution. The prepared catalyst was used for the fluorination of 1, 1, 2, 3- tetrachloropropene to 2- chloro-3, 3, 3- trifluoropropene, and its catalytic activity, morphology, crystal structure, particle size, and stability were studied. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Chemicals and materials The solvents were used directly without any treatment. The chemicals Chromium (III) nitrate nonahydrate (>98 wt.%, Macklin), Zinc nitrate hexahydrate (98 wt.%, EnergyChemical), Glycine (>99 wt.%, Innochem), Graphite (99 wt.%, J&K Scientific), Anhydrous hydrogen fluoride (>99 wt.%, Gansu Lihong New Materials Technology Co., Ltd), Methyl cellulose (Innochem), 1, 1, 2, 3-tetrachloropropene (>99 wt.%, Innochem), Vinylidene chloride (99 wt.%, Innochem), were used directly without purification. 2.2 Synthesis of nanometer chromium oxide-based catalyst The Zn-doped chromium-oxide catalyst was prepared by the microwave-assisted solution combustion method. The specific preparation method is as follows: A certain proportion of metallic nitric acid was dissolved in 150–300 mL of distilled water, and an appropriate amount of glycine was added (the molar ratio of chromium was 3–4). The solution is heated and evaporated at 70 °C until it becomes gel-like. The gel was put in the microwave oven (800 W, 2.45 Hz, 23 L) for 3 min and burned by gas injection; After combustion, the sample was cooled to obtain a green foam-like solid. The foam solid sample was calcined at 500 °C for 2 h; 3 % (wt.%) colloidal graphite was added to the calcined oxide and ground with a high-speed universal grinder. An appropriate 5 % (wt.%) methylcellulose solution was added to the mixture, extruded to form, and air-dried at room temperature. For example, dissolve 20 g chromium nitrate 9-hydrate and 1.49 g zinc nitrate hexahydrate (molar ratio of Cr: Zn = 10: 1) in 200 mL distilled water, add an appropriate amount of glycine (molar ratio of chromium nitrate: glycine), and stir well. The solution is stirred at 70 °C until it is gelatinized. The gelatinous sample was put into a microwave oven (800 w, 2.45 Hz, 23 L) for 3 min, during which the residual water of the sample rapidly evaporated and the sample temperature rose sharply due to sample jet combustion. After combustion was completed, the fluffy foam sample was obtained and calcined in a muffle furnace at 500 °C for 2 h. 3 % (wt.%) colloidal graphite was added to the calcined oxide and ground with a high-speed universal grinder. Appropriate 5 % (wt.%) methylcellulose solution was added to the mixture, extruded to form, and air dried at room temperature. The precursor of SCS-Cr / Zn-10 catalyst was obtained. The preparation methods of other catalysts SCS-Cr / Zn-15, SCS-Cr / Zn-20, SCS-Cr / Zn-25, SCS-Cr / Zn-30, SCS-Cr / Zn-35, SCS-Cr / Zn-40 and SCS-Cr / Zn-45 are similar. 2.3 Catalysts characterization SEM images were recorded on a Hitachi SU8020 microscope (Tokyo, Japan) to assess the particle dimensions and morphology. TG analysis was conducted on the Netzsch STA449F3 simultaneous thermal analyzer (Selb, Germany) in an N2 atmosphere between 20 and 800 °C. The BET sorption of N2 was recorded on Micromeritics ASAP2010 instrument (USA), and the samples were degassed at 80 °C for 4 h before measurement. The pore size and volume distributions were calculated by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) technique and the surface areas were estimated using the BET method. XPS spectra were performed on an ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with Al Kα X-ray as an excitation source. 2.4 Catalytic tests The experiment was carried out in a fixed-tube reactor (stainless steel, 7.5 mm diameter), as shown in Fig. 1 .1, with the reaction temperature ranging from 200 to 350 °C and the space velocity of 500 h−1. Firstly, the catalyst (5 g) was put into the isothermal zone of the reactor, and a thermocouple was placed in the middle of the catalyst bed to monitor the reaction temperature. In addition, after the catalyst is installed, its air tightness is strictly tested. After the air tightness test, the pre-fluorination process of the catalyst was started: the reaction tube was heated to 350 °C, N2 was introduced for 5 mL / min for 2 h, and the catalyst precursor was dried and roasted. Then, HF gas was introduced into the reaction tube at a flow rate of 50 mL / min, and the temperature of the reaction tube was still 350 °C. The catalyst was pre-fluorinated, and water was generated during the pre-fluorination. As the fluorination time increased (24 h), the generated water decreased continuously until no more water was generated, and the pre-fluorination was completed. The reactant was injected into the reaction tube at a speed of 0.014 mL / min by an injection pump, and the flow rate of HF (80 mL /min) was controlled by a mass flow controller. Excess hydrogen fluoride at the reaction outlet is absorbed by an alkaline scrubber (KOH solution at 50 °C), and then the reactor effluent enters an online gas chromatograph (Acme 6100 GC) equipped with a PoraPLOT Q column and TCD (thermal conductivity detector) for analysis and detection by the chromatographic normalization method. In addition, the tail gas from gas chromatography is introduced into potassium hydroxide solution for acid removal. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalysts characterization 3.1.1 X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies The XRD characterization of SCS-Cr / Zn catalysts with different loadings is shown in Fig. 2 . From the figure, the 2θ is 25.2° that attributed to the graphite peak, and the crystalline Cr2O3 diffraction peaks (2θ is 44.4, 34.4 and 36.2, 63.2 and 65.0°) can be clearly observed. These catalysts have similar diffraction peaks, which demonstrates that all catalysts have the same characteristics. In addition, no other diffraction peaks were found in the catalyst, indicating a good dispersion of Zn in the catalyst. 3.1.2 XPS analysis The XPS characterization was used to analyze the elemental composition and oxidation valence of the catalyst surface, as shown in Fig. 3 (1). Fig. 3(2) shows the high-resolution map of Zn 2p. In the figure, two characteristic peaks near 1021 eV and 1044 eV correspond to Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, respectively, indicating that Zn exists in the form of ZnO. On the whole, the change of Zn addition makes the binding of Cr move in a higher direction. The addition of Zn has a great influence on the acidity number and intensity of the acid sites of the catalyst, especially the medium-strong acid. As can be seen from Fig. 3(2), the binding energy of Zn can move in a lower direction, indicating that some electrons of Cr are transferred to Zn, and Zn and Cr have interacted. By separating the peak of Cr2p3/2 into two peaks, 576.5 eV belongs to Cr (III) and 578.2 eV belongs to Cr (VI) [19]. Corresponding to the XRD pattern of the catalyst, Cr2O3 is at 576.5 eV, and the content of Cr (VI) is not high, and there is no characteristic peak in XRD, so we speculate that it is chromium oxide CrO3 with high valence [20]. Cr (VI) can be transformed into CrOxFy active center in the process of pre-fluorination, which is beneficial to the reaction [21]. 3.1.3 Acidity analysis The NH3-TPD curve of the catalyst is shown in Fig. 4 . The catalyst has three NH3 desorption peaks: the peak at 180 °C can be attributed to a weak acid center, the peak at 350 °C can be attributed to a medium-strong acid center, and the peak at 500 °C can be attributed to strong acid center [22–24]. As can be seen from the figure, the addition of Zn has a great influence on the acidity of the catalyst, especially the medium-strong acid. The Zn-free Cr2O3 nano-catalyst has almost no weak acid or medium-strong acid, and the number of strong acid centers is very small. After adding a small amount of Zn to the catalyst SCS-Cr / Zn-45, a small number of weak acid centers and medium-strong acid centers were mainly produced, and the content of Zn continued to be adjusted. When the molar ratio of Cr / Zn was greater than 45, the addition of Zn promoted the generation of strong acid centers in the catalyst. Among SCS-Cr / Zn-40, Cr: Zn = 40: 1 (molar ratio) has the greatest positive effect on the acidity of the catalyst. These acidic centers provide adsorption centers for chlorine-containing molecules, thus accelerating the reaction. 3.1.4 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies The SEM image of the catalyst is shown in Fig. 5 . The results are consistent with the XRD image, which demonstrates that the addition of a small amount of Zn has little effect on the morphology of the catalyst. The SEM image of the catalyst without Zn doping is similar to the catalyst with a small amount of Zn doping, and both of them are uniformly distributed nanoparticles. Furthermore, it is evident from (2) and (4) that the catalysts are primarily spherical balls of uniform shape. All catalysts feature mesoporous structures and numerous micropores with variable shapes, as can be observed from (1) and (3) [25]. 3.1.5 TG analysis of catalysts The deactivated catalyst is measured by thermogravimetry, as shown in Fig. 6 . At around 450 °C, weight gain occurred on the TG curve of SCS-Cr / Zn-0, which was called the oxidation induction period, indicating that there were oxidized substances on the catalyst at this temperature. Through XPS and XRD, it was found that both Cr and Zn had formed oxides. Therefore, we think that on the surface of the deactivated catalyst, there are polymers containing chlorine and propylene as reactants. Because the reactants polymerize on the catalyst surface, they occupy the adsorption of the acidic center and cover the active center, which leads to its deactivation [16]. The TG curve of catalyst SCS-Cr / Zn-40 began to lose weight at 400 °C, which may be due to the oxidation of carbon on the surface of the catalyst to CO2. 3.1.6 N2 adsorption-desorption The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm of the deactivated catalyst is shown in Fig. 7 . The BET surface area, pore volume, and BJH average pore size of SCS-Cr / Zn-40 were 172.8 m2/g, 0.24 cm3/g, and 5.19 nm, respectively (Table 1 ). The BET surface area of the deactivated catalyst is 25.3 m2 /g after 45 h. In addition, pore volume and pore diameter decreased after the reaction, which could be due to the high-temperature carbon deposition as well as the changes in the acidic sites and strength of the catalyst during the reaction. 3.2 Performance of catalytic fluorination The catalytic performance of the reaction was evaluated with fluorination of 1, 1, 2, 3-tetrachloropropene (HCC-1230xa) as the probe reaction. HCC-1230xa was easily converted during the reaction, which was not detected at the outlet of the reaction tube, indicating that the substrate had been completely converted in the reaction. At a reaction temperature of 220 °C, the molar ratio of HF to 1, 1, 2, 3- tetrachloropropene was 10:1, and the contact time was 10 s, the catalytic performance of the catalyst was evaluated. As shown in Fig. 8 , the catalyst SCS-Cr / Zn-0 was quickly deactivated during the reaction, which was consistent with the characterization results in NH3-TPD, because the catalyst without Zn doping had a small acid content and did not perform well in the reaction. The performance of catalyst SCS-Cr / Zn-45 in the reaction is slightly better than that of SCS-Cr / Zn-0, but its lifespan is not obviously prolonged because of its weak acidity. The catalyst SCS-Cr / Zn-40 has the highest selectivity and the longest service lifetime. This is because SCS-Cr / Zn-40 has a strong acidic center, which makes chlorine-containing tetrachloropropene molecules adsorb on the CrOxFy active center on the surface to react. However, with the increase in Zn content, the acidic center of the catalyst is not enhanced, and its selectivity to 1233xf is reduced in the catalytic reaction. Subsequently, the influence of reaction time on the performance of the catalyst was investigated by using SCS-Cr / Zn-40 as the catalyst and vinylidene chloride (VDC) as the substrate. The SCS-Cr / Zn-40 nano-catalyst has not been reported in the existing fluorination reaction of vinylidene chloride [26–27], which serves as a foundation for the industrial manufacture of high-purity VDF. When the molar ratio of HF / VDC is 10:1 and the contact time is 10 s, the reaction temperature is screened. Fig. 9 shows the results of catalytic evaluation at reaction temperatures of 140 °C, 180 °C and 220 °C respectively. When the reaction temperature is 220 °C, the conversion rate of reactants reaches 94 % and the selectivity of products reaches 82 %. When the reaction temperature rises again, it has no effect on the conversion rate of reactants, but with the increase in temperature, the by-products increase. The catalytic performance of the catalyst was evaluated at a reaction temperature of 220 °C, a molar ratio of HF to VDC of 10:1, and a contact time of 10 s. During the reaction, as shown in Fig. 10 , it was found that the VDC conversion rate reached 95 % or above, and with the reaction, the conversion first increased and then decreased. It was found that SCS-Cr / Zn-15 showed good selectivity at the initial stage of the reaction, but with the progress of the reaction, the catalyst activity showed a trend of rapid decline. SCS-Cr / Zn-40 did not show good stability at the initial stage of the reaction, but the catalytic performance of the catalyst tended to be stable as the reaction progressed. 4 Conclusions A series of nanometer-sized Cr2O3 catalysts doped with different Zn content were prepared by the microwave-assisted combustion method, and the catalytic performance of the catalysts was investigated by fluorination of chloroolefins with HF. The effect of Zn doping on catalyst acidity was studied, and the stability of the catalyst was evaluated. The XRD, XPS, and NH3-TPD characterization results demonstrated that the doping of trace Zn had a small impact on the crystal structure of the catalysts but a significant effect on the surface acidity of the catalysts, which increased the amount of weak and medium-strong acids on the catalyst's surface and served as an adsorption center for the reactant HCC-1230xa. In addition, the addition of a small amount of Zn can increase the content of high chromium and increase the amount of surface active center CrOxFy. In the reaction, it was found that the selectivity of the target product of the SCS-Cr / Zn-40 catalyst remained more than 90 % stable after a long time of high temperature reaction. In addition, the addition of an appropriate amount of Zn can improve the stability of the catalyst. SCSCr / Zn-40 also showed good catalytic activity in the reaction of VDF with VDC fluorination (Scheme 1 ). CRediT authorship contribution statement Fuxiang Jin: Conceptualization.

        "dc:description": "A series of Zn-doped nano-Cr2O3 catalysts were prepared by the microwave-assisted combustion method, and the catalysts were successfully applied to the fluorination of 1, 1, 2, 3-tetrachloropropene to synthesize 2-chloro-3, 3, 3-trifluoropropene, and the fluorination of vinylidene chloride to vinylidene fluoride using anhydrous hydrogen fluoride, which is much more efficient than catalyst reported in literatures. By XRD, XPS, and NH3-TPD, it was confirmed that the doping of a small amount of Zn did not have a great influence on the crystal structure of the catalyst but had a great influence on the acidity of the catalyst surface, which increased the number of weak acids and medium acids on the catalyst surface. In addition, the addition of a small amount of Zn could increase the content of high-valent chromium and produce more CrOxFy active centers. As the number of acid sites increases, it provides adsorption centers for chlorine-containing molecules, and the increase of CrOxFy active centers promotes the reaction. They work together to improve the catalytic performance of the catalyst.",
