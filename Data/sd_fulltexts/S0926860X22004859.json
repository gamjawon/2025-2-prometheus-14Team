Field testing toward mercury emission properties was conducted at a 300 MW coal-fired power station. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) was found to reduce Hg content in flue gas significantly through catalyst breakage during the commercial testing in a 300 MW coal-fired power station. Field testing results indicate that the total mercury concentration in flue gas at electrostatic precipitator (ESP) inlet and ESP outlet increase due to SCR catalyst breakage. Correspondingly, mercury content in fly ash decrease and mercury content in gypsum increase. The evolution in laboratory confirmed the Hg0 oxidation capability of commercial SCR catalyst. Catalyst breakage leads to space velocity increasing, so that the lower Hg0 oxidation rates caused the mercury transformation change in flue gas and solid byproducts. Graphical Abstract ga1 Keywords Mercury emission SCR catalyst Catalyst breakage Mercury oxidation Combustion byproduct Data Availability Data will be made available on request. 1 Introduction Mercury emitted from coal combustion has been identified as the hazardous air pollutant of great potential public health concern under the circumstance that coal-fired power plants play a vital role in electricity generation all over the world [1]. With regard to three forms of mercury in coal-derived flue gas, oxidized mercury (Hg2+) and particle-bound mercury (HgP) are relatively easy to remove by current air pollution control devices (APCDs) such as desulfurization unit and dust extraction unit [2–4]. The selective catalytic reduction (SCR) with NH3 has been a widely used technology as deNOx devices. Lots of investigations found that SCR catalysts behaved catalytic activity towards Hg0 oxidation [5–8]. At the circumstance of higher Hg2+ ratio in flue gas, both the reaction of Hg bounded to fly ash and the Hg absorption by gypsum slurry will be enhanced [9]. So the oxidation of Hg0 to Hg2+ should be a key process that decides the overall Hg removal efficiency by current APCDs. Most coal-fired power stations have equipped SCR systems for controlling NOx emissions. SCR catalysts employed are typically composed of V2O5 and WO3 supported on TiO2. Recent studies have confirmed the catalytic mechanisms of these components on Hg0 oxidation to Hg2+. Eswaran and Stenger[10] investigated the effect of HCl and H2SO4 on mercury oxidation with a laboratory-scale SCR system using a commercial honeycomb vanadium−titanium catalyst. They found that at the concentrations of 35 ppm of HCl and 50 ppm of H2SO4, respectively, a maximum Hg0 oxidation rate of 70% was achieved. Straube et al.[11] performed a bench-scale investigation on Hg0 adsorption and oxidation over V2O5 containing catalyst and confirmed that both NO and NH3 inhibit the HCl assisted oxidation in flue gas. For oxidation mechanisms, vanadium species were supposed as a key component in catalysts. Hg0 oxidation process led the V5+ transform to V4+ in catalysts and consumed a part of the lattice oxygen on catalyst surface[12]. At such a catalytic system, sufficient HCl concentration is necessary for Hg0 conversion[13]. Hg0 oxidation over SCR catalyst followed the Eley–Rideal mechanism, where HCl was first adsorbed on the active surface of catalysts to form active surface species[14]. Besides, field testing around the mercury transformation on SCR system in actual coal-fired power plants had been also conducted. Around 30%− 90% Hg0 oxidation rate were observed with various coal and boilers[15,16]. For instance, bituminous coals burning in boilers showed higher Hg0 oxidation rate across SCR systems than sub-bituminous coals burning[17]. Cl concentration in flue gas is one of the important factors. As porous materials, SCR catalyst was also supposed as the Hg adsorbent. Li et al.[18] detected the mercury speciation and concentrations before and after SCR systems in a 300 MW power plant. However, the results show that SCR has little effect on mercury emission reduction and the concentration of HgP changes little before and after SCR. Therefore, the main effect of SCR system on mercury is the changing of the Hg2+/Hg0 ratio in flue gas. The most common particulate control device equipped in coal-fired power plant is cold-side electrostatic precipitator (ESP) or fabric filter (FF). Both the devices operate at temperatures in the range of 130–200 °C. Hg is favored to bind to fly ash at this temperature range and then captured by ESP or FF. In this process, higher Hg2+ ratio in flue gas should increase the HgP formation rate[19–21]. Another Hg2+ scrubber that Wet Flue Gas Desulfurization (WFGD) has been well known to synergetic remove mercury. Its mercury removal efficiency is more depend on Hg2+/Hg0 ratio[22]. In general, the promotion of Hg0 oxidation efficiency by SCR system is benefiting to the following synergetic mercury removal with ESP and WFGD. Several researchers paid attention to the SCR catalyst age which may influence both the NOx and Hg0 oxidation. Compared two boilers in a same coal-fired power plant with SCR catalyst service for 35000 h and less than 3000 h, Zhou et al. found that the Hg0 conversion efficiency decreased from 61.78% to 4.12%[23]. They also conducted the experiment in laboratory and confirmed the deactivation of 35000 h running catalyst[24]. During the running in power plants, SCR catalysts are always exposed to high temperature and dusty surroundings, poisoning and breakage could occur at any time. Any change of SCR catalyst may cause the mercury emission properties changing. In this work, SCR catalysts partial breakage was just observed in a 300 MW coal-fired power plant. The mercury emissions were detected before and after catalyst breakage. Through the comparison, the influence of SCR catalyst breakage on mercury emission properties changing was clarified. The commercial SCR catalyst was also analyzed and evaluated in the laboratory to give the verification. 2 Experimental 2.1 Field testing of mercury emissions Two times of field testing work were conducted at a coal-fired power station with a 300 MW pulverized boiler. The diagram of the devices and sampling locations is shown in Fig. 1. Gas sampling locations were set at ESP inlet, ESP outlet and WFGD outlet. Gas samples were obtained using the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) Method 30B. Feed coal, fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum were sampled at the same time of gas sampling. The mercury content in solid samples was analyzed by mercury measurement LUMEX RA 915 + . The mercury content in liquid samples was analyzed by mercury measurement LEEMAN hydro II AA. The flue gas entrance of SCR system contains two sides. Three layers of cellular catalyst were arranged. Due to the heterogeneous gas flow with dust, parts of catalysts near boilers were breakage. Fig. 2 shows the photo shot while the second testing. It indicates that the first layer at the front wall of catalysts was broken seriously with leak in the middle. 2.2 SCR catalyst characterization Commercial SCR catalysts were collected at the above 300 MW coal-fired power plant equipped with SCR system. Before lab-scale evolution, the faveolate solid was broken to powder. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were carried out on a Rigaku D/max-1200 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The concentrations of Ti, V, W, and Si in the catalyst were detected using an X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer (EAGLE III, EDAX Inc., USA). X-ray photoelectron (XPS) measurements were performed on a PHI Quantera XXMTM by using Al Kα or Mg Kα irradiations. The binding energy positions were normalized with standard bind energy (284.4 eV, C1s). 2.3 Laboratory evolution of Hg0 oxidation Commercial SCR catalyst samples were collected from tested 300 MW unit during the second testing. The Hg0 oxidation efficiencies of catalysts were performed using a fix bed reactor in the laboratory under atmosphere pressure. A mixture with the components of N2, O2, NO, NH3, HCl and Hg0 was used as simulated flue gas. The temperature of 280–360 °C and gas velocity of 6000–10000 h−1 were selected as the reaction conditions. At the reactor exit, the gas product was adsorbed using EPA's Ontario Method (OHM) to obtain the Hg2+ and Hg0 concentrations. For comparison, V2O5 and WO3 supported on TiO2 materials were prepared in laboratory and their Hg0 oxidation efficiencies were also evaluated at same conditions. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 The results from field testing Field testing works were performed two times in a 300 MW coal-fired power station and lasted a week every time. During each testing, the operation conditions were maintained comparable and the boiler loads were around 85%. The feed coals employed were from the same area that belongs to the same coal rank. However, little difference may exist at different time. The mercury content in coals was analyzed and the average was 255 ng/g and 216 ng/g for each testing. The total mercury concentrations in flue gas are compared before and after SCR catalyst breakage as shown in Fig. 3. ESP inlet, ESP outlet and WFGD outlet were selected as the gas sampling locations. Because of the condition limits, different sampling times were conducted in a week. At the location of ESP inlet, before SCR catalyst breakage, the total Hg concentration was between 6.79 μg/Nm3 to 15.04 μg/Nm3, and the average concentration is 9.63 μg/Nm3. While the SCR catalyst breakage, the concentration increased as the value between 21.10 μg/Nm3 to 36.23 μg/Nm3, with the average value 25.54 μg/Nm3. The total Hg concentration at ESP inlet increased more than 2 times while the SCR catalyst partial breakage. At ESP outlet, the total Hg concentrations in flue gas for all samples decreased than the value at EPS inlet. The Hg concentrations 8.77–18.66 μg/Nm3 for normal catalyst and 1.85–10.56 μg/Nm3 for breakage catalyst were obtained. At WFGD outlet, the total Hg concentrations in flue gas decreased further that the value for most samples were less than 1 μg/Nm3. Although the concentrations of two samples at normal SCR catalyst are slightly higher than 1 μg/Nm3, the average total Hg concentration should be recognized as very close to each other. (a) ESP inlet, (b) ESP outlet, (c) WFGD outlet. Fly ash is the combustion byproduct which is captured by ESP. Fig. 4 shows the comparison of mercury content in fly ash sampled before and after SCR catalyst breakage. For the first testing at normal status, the mercury average content in fly ash is 1007 ng/g with the range of 591.9–1174 ng/g. The deviation of each sample analysis result may be caused by the unstable of coals. While catalyst breakage at the second testing, the average mercury content 293.5 ng/g with the range of 262.3–331.9 ng/g was obtained. This result is in accordance with the mercury concentration in flue gas at ESP outlet that lower mercury capture ability by ESP and fly ash leads to higher mercury existing in gas phase. Gypsum is the byproduct produced by the reaction of CaO with SO2 in WFGD. Fig. 4 shows the comparison of mercury content in gypsum sampled before and after SCR catalyst breakage. Restricted by complicated wet mixture of gypsum grout, the mercury content in gypsum was analyzed after drying. It can be seen that the mercury content in gypsum increased to more than 1.5 times while catalyst breakage. Compared with the higher mercury concentration at WFGD inlet (ESP outlet) and comparable mercury concentration at WFGD outlet in flue gas while catalyst breakage, this result is also reasonable. It may be speculate that the mercury capture ability of this WFGD is surplus for present coal combustion conditions. The transformation of mercury in flue gas and solid byproducts was analyzed and the schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 5. While SCR catalyst running normally, around 75% mercury was captured by fly ash and around 23% mercury was captured by gypsum. However, this distribution changed to 55% and 43% at the SCR catalyst breakage conditions. The lower Hg oxidation efficiency and decreased Hg2+ ratio in flue gas should be the main reason for the distribution change. 3.2 Catalyst characterization The elemental analysis results by XRF of commercial catalyst shows that V2O5, WO3, TiO2 and SiO2 contents are 0.16 wt%, 4.1 wt%, 83.2 wt%, and 6.8 wt%, respectively. The results reveal that TiO2 and WO3 are the main components. A slightly higher SiO2 content may be caused by the deposition of fly ash during the long-term running. As reported elsewhere[25], V and W were commonly used active compositions for SCR catalyst. This commercial catalyst employed a special component that V content is much less and W content. Thus it can be estimated that W should be the active catalytic phase and V may play as a promoter in this commercial catalyst during de-NOx reaction. The XRD spectrums of the commercial SCR catalyst are presented in Fig. 6. Anatase was the dominant TiO2 phase in the sample that was clearly detected. Due to the low V2O5 and WO3 load and well dispersion, none crystalline characteristic peak was detected. The XPS spectra of W 4 f and Ti 2p for commercial SCR catalyst are presented in Fig. 7. Perhaps vanadium content was under the detection limit of the apparatus, no peak about V 2p2/3 was obtained. As shown in Fig. 7a, the binding energies 33.6 eV and 34.9 eV are assigned to W 4 f7/2 and W 4 f5/2 respectively, which is ascribed to the spin–orbit splitting of W 4 f, implying also that the W element existed in the form of W6 + [26]. The sample possesses two main peaks of Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 located at 463.6 eV and 457.9 eV, respectively, thereby indicating that the Ti atoms existed in the form of Ti4+ [27]. This further confirms that WO3 and TiO2 are main components in this commercial catalyst, which is in accordance with XRF results. The elemental analysis results of the sample by XPS showed that V2O5, WO3, TiO2 and SiO2 contents are 0.25 wt%, 4.8 wt%, 81.1 wt%, and 5.2 wt%, respectively. XPS and XRF characterization both can give the elemental components at solid surface. It indicates that the result from XPS is close to XRF result, which further confirms the components of commercial SCR catalyst. 3.3 Lab-scale mercury oxidation performance testing Hg0 oxidation efficiencies of commercial SCR catalyst and laboratory prepared catalysts were evaluated in the temperature 280–360 °C as shown in Fig. 8. The results show that both commercial catalyst and laboratory-prepared catalyst had the Hg0 oxidation capability at the Hg0 conversion between 16.2%− 47.8%. At the lowest temperature 280 °C, commercial SCR catalyst behaved obvious higher Hg0 oxidation efficiency than other catalysts. While the temperature increased, the Hg0 oxidation efficiency of commercial SCR catalyst decreased. Compared to the catalysts prepared in laboratory, the higher part narrowed. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous oxidation of Hg0 to Hg2+ could occur in flue gas atmosphere. For heterogeneous oxidation mechanisms, Deacon process considered that HCl reacts with O2 which can be described as Eq. (1) [28]: (1) 2HCl(g) + 1/2 O2 ↔ Cl2(g) + H2O(g) Metal oxides could catalyze the oxidation of HCl to form Cl2, which will promote Hg0 oxidation[29]. However, thermodynamic equilibrium calculation indicates that Eq. 1 shifts to the left side wen temperature rises[30]. It leads to the Cl2 concentration decreasing following with the Hg0 conversion decrease. The Hg0 oxidation rate over commercial catalysts decreased from 280 °C to 360 °C. It illustrates the Hg0 oxidation reaction may follow the Decon process. For three types of laboratory-prepared catalysts, WO3/TiO2 behaved better at 280, 300 and 320 °C, V2O5-WO3/TiO2 behaved slightly better at 340 and 360 °C. V2O5/TiO2 behaved the worst at all temperature range. It has been recognized that TiO2 is the good SCR catalyst carrier. However, for the active components, lots of metal oxides such as V2O5, WO3, MoO3 and CeO2 could behave oxidation activity for some extent. Some researchers recognized that the lattice oxygen species are responsible for Hg0 oxidation[31]. The above results confirm that both WO3 and V2O5 should be the main active component for Hg0 oxidation by its lattice oxygen. No synergetic effect was reflected on laboratory-prepared V2O5-WO3/TiO2 catalysts. Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism was also proposed to explain Hg0 oxidation described Eqs. (2–5) [32]: (2) M(g) ↔ M(ads) (3) N (g) ↔ N(ads) (4) M(ads) + N(ads) ↔ MN(ads) (5) MN(ads) ↔ MN(g) For the case of Hg0 oxidation, M is Hg0 and N is HCl. Reactive Cl generated from adsorbed HCl then reacts with adsorbed Hg0. In the presence of solid substrates that can adsorb both Hg0 and Cl species, the Hg0 oxidation could occur according to the above reactions. However, the adsorption favored to the surface of carbon sites such as unburned carbon in fly ash[33]. Niksa and co-workers assert that HCl adsorbed on solids surface, which reacts with gas phase Hg0 via an Eley-Rideal mechanism described in Eqs. (6)–(7) [34,35]: (6) M(g) ↔ M(ads) (7) M(ads) + N (g) ↔ MN(g) According to Eqs. (6)–(7), M is HCl and N is Hg0. The adsorption of HCl is the control step during Hg0 oxidation[11,13]. He et al. reported that the HCl adsorption on catalysts surface is easy even at high temperatures[36]. Thus, the Hg0 oxidation increased first and then decreased on catalysts prepared in laboratory. Deacon process and Eley-Rideal mechanism may effects meanwhile during the reaction. It has been reported that the oxidation activity is inhibited by low temperature[37]. However, Pavlish illustrated that the activity of catalysts is weakened by high temperature due to its inhibitory effect on Hg0 adsorption[9]. At all temperature range, 320 °C is the best temperature for three laboratory-prepared catalysts. The Hg0 oxidation efficiency should be decided by both adsorption on active sites and surface reaction. Higher temperature is benefit to enhance the chemical reaction rate, but will decrease the adsorption[38]. Moreover, the oxidation reaction is exothermic, lower temperature is favorable. Thus, 320 °C should be the suitable Hg0 oxidation temperature obtained by experiments. At the lower temperature of 280 and 300 °C, commercial catalyst behaved opposite activity as laboratory-prepared catalysts that the Hg0 conversion slightly increased. The Hg0 oxidation efficiencies of commercial SCR catalyst with different gas space velocities are shown in Fig. 9. The results indicate that the Hg0 oxidation efficiency decreased at all temperature range while the space velocity increased. Moreover, the tendency of Hg0 oxidation efficiency with temperature is similar. When the space velocity increases, the retention time of Hg0 towards catalysts is reduced, which should be the reason of the catalytic activity decrease. The above results confirm that the commercial SCR catalyst has the Hg0 oxidation capability in the fixed-bed reactor laboratory, but the Hg0 oxidation efficiency is influenced by space velocity. In the laboratory experiment, the change of space velocity is conducted through the change of catalysts bed height. With regards to the catalysts partial breakage in the power plant, it seems that the catalyst bed was decreased, which leads to the reaction space velocity increasing. Corresponding to the laboratory results, the Hg0 oxidation rates should be decreased. For the field testing results in this work, the variation in Hg0 oxidation rate is reflected by the total Hg emissions in flue gas and solid byproducts. The bounding of fly ash to mercury is affected by mainly two factors: one is the temperature; another is the mercury valence[39]. Lower Hg2+/Hg0 ratio in gas phase would inevitably reduce the Hg adsorption capability by fly ash. This leads to the higher total Hg concentration in flue gas at ESP inlet and outlet, and simultaneously decreases the Hg content in fly ash. Fortunately, the reduction of Hg2+ to Hg0 and the re-emission of Hg to gas in WFGD as reported by elsewhere[40] did not happen. Instead, the gypsum slurry in this WFGD has strong mercury oxidation and absorption ability that most surplus mercury in flue gas at WFGD inlet was captured. Briefly, the breakage of SCR catalyst changed the mercury distribution in byproducts but still maintains the low emission in flus gas at the chimney. 4 Conclusions In this work, the effects of SCR catalyst breakage on the mercury transformation and emission properties were investigated through both field testing and laboratory evolution. V2O5-WO3/TiO2 based SCR catalyst was employed in this 300 MW coal-fired power station. The mercury concentration in flue gas at ESP inlet and ESP outlet increased while SCR catalyst partial breakage happened, following with the mercury content decrease in fly ash and mercury content increase in gypsum. The experiment data indicate that SCR catalyst has Hg0 oxidation capability and the oxidation efficiency influenced by reaction space velocity. Thus it can be concluded that the lower Hg0 oxidation efficiency and decreased Hg2+ ratio in flue gas is the reason for the mercury distribution change.

        "dc:description": "Field testing toward mercury emission properties was conducted at a 300 MW coal-fired power station. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) was found to reduce Hg content in flue gas significantly through catalyst breakage during the commercial testing in a 300 MW coal-fired power station. Field testing results indicate that the total mercury concentration in flue gas at electrostatic precipitator (ESP) inlet and ESP outlet increase due to SCR catalyst breakage. Correspondingly, mercury content in fly ash decrease and mercury content in gypsum increase. The evolution in laboratory confirmed the Hg0 oxidation capability of commercial SCR catalyst. Catalyst breakage leads to space velocity increasing, so that the lower Hg0 oxidation rates caused the mercury transformation change in flue gas and solid byproducts.",
