AUGUSTINE* and UU JIWAN** Department of Chemistry, Seton Hall University, South Orange, NJ 07079 (U.S.A.) (Received November 25, 1986; accepted February 5,1986) Summary Modification of silica, alumina, or silica-magnesia by attachment of pendant organophosphines gave phosphinated oxides which on treatment with Na2PdCl4 and heating gave black, catalytically active species shown to be metallic Pd supported on these modified oxides, and not supported Pd: phosphine complexes. The pendant phosphine groups interact with the Pd metal to influence the olefin hydrogenation activity and to markedly de- crease the double bond isomerization capability of these catalysts. Introduction While the study of supported homogeneous catalysts has been rather extensively investigated over the past several years [1], most of this work has involved the use of various functionalized polymeric materials as supports, with fewer reports concerning the use of inorganic oxides as the support materials [2,3]. In this area, most of the work has involved bifunctional organic compounds capable of reacting at one end with the oxide surface and at the other with a metal salt via ligand interaction. The most commonly used of these bifunctional organic species have at one end a silane derivative which can undergo a facile reaction with hydroxy groups on the surface of the oxide, and at the other end a phosphine or nitrogen functionality capa- ble of metal complex formation [1]. Usually these two groups are separated by two or three methylene groups and, in the phosphine series, have a diphenylphosphine moiety so that the resulting ligand is an alkyldiphenyl- phosphine [1,2]. The use of 4-(3-trichlorosilylpropyl)phenyldiphenylphos- phine, however, gave a species with a triphenylphosphine ligand attached to the oxide by a three-carbon chain. Ligand exchange with Wilkinson catalyst gave an active hydrogenation catalyst [3]. *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. **0n leave from Department of Chemistry, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. 0304-5102/86/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 190 Modification of this procedure led to the preparation of a silica- supported propyl-m-phenyldiphenylphosphine which on reaction with NaaPdC^ gave an effective catalyst for olefin hydrogenation [4]. Analogous species supported on alumina or silica/magnesia (Flurisil) as well as long chain alkyldiphenylphosphines on these same oxides all gave active hydro- genation catalysts on reaction with NazPdC^ [5]. All of these catalytic species, however, had a black color typical of a supported Pd metal catalyst and not the yellow color expected for a Pd(0) or Pd(II) phosphine complex. It was thought that if these species did contain supported metal particles they would represent a unique series of catalysts: oxide-supported Pd sur- rounded by pendant phosphine groups. Given the report on the use of tri- phenylphosphine-modified Pd/C to promote allylic substitution [6], these phosphinated oxide supported catalysts could prove to be quite useful. This would be especially true if the allylation activity in the Pd/C/03? system is promoted by Pd species leached from the metal surface by the triphenyl- phosphine and reacting in solution. If the phosphines were attached to the support material, the system would remain heterogeneous regardless of the nature of the P Pd interaction. It was considered necessary, then, to determine the nature of the Pd in these phosphinated oxide systems and then to determine what effect the phosphine ligand and oxide present have on the catalytic activity of these species. The following is a description of our efforts in this regard. Experimental Catalyst preparation * The surface areas of the oxides, as measured by conventional BET determinations, are: SiOa, 97.6 m2 g~1; A^Oa, 39.4 m2 g~1; SiOz/MgO, 83.3 m2 g~1. The phosphinated oxides were prepared using a modification of the method described by Moreto [3]. A mixture of m-chloroallylbenzene and trimethoxysilane in a 1:1 molar ratio was heated at 60 - 70 C for 6 h in the presence of a catalytic amount of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)platinum. Distillation gave a 75% yield of 3- (m-chlorophenyl)trimethoxysilylpropane: b.p. 138 -140 C (4 mmHg). Anal: Calc. for C^H^SiO^Cl: Cl, 12.9%; Found: Cl, 13.3%. This material (14.5 g) was refluxed with a 100% molar excess of lithium diphenylphos- phine for 24 h in THF under an Ar atmosphere, and to the resulting solution was added 5.5 g of the appropriate oxide, with refluxing under Ar continued for an additional 24 h. Water (25 ml) was added and the mixture stirred for an additional 1 - 2 h and then saturated with CO 2 to neutrality. The phos- phinated oxide was removed by filtration, dried under an IR lamp for 12 h and then in a vacuum dessicator for an additional 24 h.

These phosphinated oxides were then refluxed in acetone, under Ar, with Na2PdCl4 at a P:Pd ratio of 5:1. Filtration, washing with acetone and water and drying in a vacuum oven at 75 - 80 C for 24 h gave the catalyt- ically active species: P02 I Si02/MgO)-0-^i-(CH2)3-^ J-Pd II Al203)-0-Si-(CH2)3- 0 III Si02)-O^Si-(CH2)3-f V1 0 IV Si02/MgO)-0-Si-(CH2)n P^-Pd V Al203)-0-)3i-(CH2)n P02-Pd 0 VI SiC^-O-^i-^C^)!!

The decane and ethanol (absolute) solvents were distilled from sodium before use.

After the addi- tion of 50 mg of the catalyst and 20 ml of the solvent to the reactor flask, it was connected to the hydrogenation apparatus and the system alternately evacuated and filled with Ha three times. The internal pressure was adjusted to atmospheric, and the catalyst and solvent stirred under H; for 10 min using a magnetic stirrer at a fixed setting. After readjustment of the pressure to atmospheric, the stirrer was stopped and 0.25 ml of 3-methyl-l-cyclo- hexene (1) was injected into the reactor. Stirring was restarted and the rate of hydrogen uptake was measured using the technique described previously [7c], After 35% completion, an 0.5 ml aliquot was removed from the reactor, centrifuged and analyzed by gas chromatography to determine the extent of isomerization to 1-methyl-l-cyclohexene (2). The temperature of the reactor was maintained at either 20 or 40 C 0.1 C using a Haake A80 circulating bath connected to the jacketted reactor flask.

ESCA analyses These were run on catalyst V and a yellow material taken from the preparation of catalyst VI prior to the final heating step (VII) using an HP 5950A spectrometer with Al Ka monochromatized radiation. The Pd binding energies, corrected to Cis, were 335.2 eV for V and 337.1 eV for VII, in agreement with the assignment of Pd(0) for V and Pd(II) for VII. Results and discussion The catalysts used in this study were prepared using a modification of the procedure of Moreto [3], as shown in Scheme 1. Three oxides were used, SiOz/MgO (Florisil), A^Os, and SiO;. In one set of catalysts the (m-diphen- ylphosphinophenyl)propyl group was attached to these oxides via a siloxane group (Catalysts I, II and III respectively). These species contain the sup- ported triphenylphosphine moiety. In the second set (Catalysts IV, V and VI), the pendant phosphine is the a5-diphenylphosphinoundecyl group, which is an alkyldiphenylphosphine. Refluxing the oxide-supported phos- phines in acetone with NazPdC^ gave a yellow solid (Catalyst VII), which on drying in a vacuum oven turned black. ESCA analysis of the yellow solid taken from the preparation of VI prior to the final heating gave a Pd binding energy of 337.1 eV typical of a Pd(II) species. The black V had a Pd binding energy of 335.2 eV, a value in agreement with the presence of a Pd(0) mate- rial. No Pd(II) was detected in this material, nor was any Pd(0) found in the unheated sample. The nature of this reduction is not entirely clear at this time. A recent report concerning catalyst preparation from the treatment of a phosphinated polystyrene with PdCl; stated that XPS analysis showed the 194 (c^P^Pt Cl-R-CH^CH; + HSi(OCH3)3 - > Cl-R-CH2-CH2-Si(OCH3)3 ' ^ MOx Mq,V-0-Sl-CH2-CH2-R-P^2 < ^ 2p-R-CH2-CH2-si(OCH3)3 -0 0 0 (f> 0 ' ^ \\/ ^~^ P^s^ ^ ^ R- (1) Acetone/reflux (2) Filter/heat R = ^'y-CH^ or -(CH2)9 MOx = SiC>2, A1203, or SiO^/MgO Scheme 1. presence of both bound Pd(II) and metallic Pd(0), with the latter being the catalytically active component [10]. In line with this, I-VI were allcatalyt- ically active in olefin hydrogenations, while VII was inert. In view of these observations, it was felt that the phosphine group was the logical candidate for the reducing agent, possibly, in the case of the oxide-supported species, in conjunction with the surface OH groups pres- ent on these entities. To test this hypothesis, a mixture of SiOz, triphenyl- phosphine and PdCl; was refluxed in acetone for 24 h with only a yellow color being imparted to the silica. The addition of a small amount of isopro- panol as a potential reducing agent during the reflux had no effect. However, filtering the mixture and heating the residue did give a black material with an appearance similar to that of catalysts I-VI. Further work is underway to determine the nature of this reduction process. Since the black color of these species (I-VI) indicated the presence of a supported Pd metal rather than a 'heterogenized homogeneous' Pd(0) complex, it was necessary to define the status of the Pd before any further work could be done. To accomplish this end, these catalysts were tested for the hydrogenation of cyclohexene in decane at 20 C after being stirred with mercury for 30 min. In no instance was any catalytic activity observed even though, as described later, I-VI were active olefin hydrogenation catalysts under these conditions in the absence of mercury. Since it has been estab- lished that heterogeneous metal(O) catalysts are poisoned with mercury while homogeneous metal(O) species are not [11, 12], it must be concluded that species I-VI are composed of Pd(0) crystallites supported on oxides to 195 which pendant phosphine groups have been attached, as depicted in Scheme 1. The reaction used to evaluate the catalytic activity of these materials was the hydrogenation of 3-methylcyclohexene (1) and its concomitant isomerization to 1-methylcyclohexene (2), with the rate of both reactions determined at the same time. We have used this reaction routinely as a means of evaluating both catalysts [8] and reaction conditions [13]. With typical commercial 5% Pd/C catalysts at 20 C, the rates of hydrogen uptake are generally in the range of 10 -15 mmol (mmol Pd)~1 muT1 with about 25 - 35% of the isomer 2 present after 25% saturation*. The rate data for the hydrogenation of 1 over I-VI in decane or ethanol as solvent at 40 or 20 C are summarized in Table 2. The percentages of 2 found in these reaction mix- tures after 35% hydrogenation are listed in Table 3. The hydrogen uptake data in Table 2 shows no apparent relationship to either the P:Pd ratio or oxide surface coverage by the pendant phosphine (Table 1), nor does there appear to be any general influence of the oxide support on the rates of hydrogenation; The most marked influence on these data is the nature of the pendant phosphine groups, which is illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2. In Fig. 1 are shown the hydrogen uptake curves for the hydro- genation of 1 over catalysts I-VI in decane at 20 C. Figure 2 shows the same data for the reaction run in ethanol. In decane, those catalysts (I-III) with the triarylphosphine groups are more active than are those (IV-VI) with the alkyldiphenylphosphine entities. With the exception of catalyst I, this same trend is observed with hydrogenations run at 40 C. In fact, as illustrated in Fig. 3 for catalysts III and VI, the rate of hydrogenation over the triaryl- phosphine species at 20 C is about the same as that found with the alkyl- diphenylphosphine catalysts run at 40 C. The same correlation is found with catalysts II and V. It would appear then, that while these catalysts are not 'supported homogeneous' species, the pendant phosphine groups are inter- acting with the supported palladium metal and modifying their activity. *Data from Refs. 8 and 13 and unpublished results.

The apparent activation energies for the hydrogenations run over catal- ysts II - VI range from 6 to 11 kcal moF', so the rates of hydrogenation over these catalysts are not diffusion controlled [14]. The reason for the slow rate observed with I at 40 C is not apparent but, as discussed below, this material also gives anomalous results in ethanol at 40 C. In decane this effect is noted by a decrease in rate as the reaction proceeds, so there must be some mode of catalyst deactivation taking place during the reaction. The mechanism for this deactivation in decane must involve both the silica/ magnesia and the triarylphosphine, since IV does not exhibit such behavior. Perhaps the high P:Pd ratio in I is a contributing factor. With the exception of catalyst III the phosphine effect noted above is also occurring in ethanol at 20 C (Fig. 2). However, the data in Table 2 show that over catalysts I, II, IV, and V hydrogenation takes place more slowly at 40 C than at 20 C. Further, these results were quite difficult to reproduce, so it was felt that with these catalysts some interaction with the ethanol solvent must be taking place to deactivate them at the higher temperature. To check this idea, the two alumina-supported materials were first heated in ethanol under Hz at 40 C for 30 min and then cooled to 20 C and used for the hydrogenation of 1. With both catalysts the rate decreased markedly from that found with catalyst samples which were used at 20 C without prior heating: It dropped from 11.85 to 2.83 for catalyst II, and from 6.24 to 1.59 for catalyst V. 198 The effect of ethanol on the silica-supported catalysts III and VI is quite pronounced, but there is no apparent catalyst deactivation with these species. Instead, the rates of reaction are very similar at both 40 and 20 C, with apparent activation energies of about 2.5 kcal mol\"1. These reactions are diffusion controlled [14], so the ethanol must be interacting with the catalyst surface in such a way as to inhibit the passage of the reactants to the active sites. As seen by the data listed in Table 3, relatively little isomerization to 2 was found in these hydrogenations, with only a few percent of the isomer detected in aliquots taken from the reaction mixture after 35% saturation. This is in contrast to the 30 - 35% isomerization noted after 25% hydrogena- tion of 1 over 5% Pd/C [8]. To see if there might be some evidence for the simultaneous hydrogenations of 1 and 2 over these phosphinated catalysts, 2 was hydrogenated over catalyst III at 20 C in both decane and ethanol; the rate curves along with the corresponding data from the hydrogenation of 1 are^hown in Fig. 4. In decane the hydrogenation of 2 takes place at a rate of 0.68 mmol H; (mmol Pd)~1 muT1, compared to a value of 13.67 for the hydrogenation of 1; thus in this solvent, it is highly unlikely that extensive amounts of 2 were formed during the hydrogenation of 1 and then saturated along with 1 to result in only small amounts of isomerization being detected. In ethanol 2 hydrogenates at ~ 60% the rate of 1 (3.22 mmol H^ (mmol 1200 - 900 - 600 _ 500 200 160 120 MINUTES Fig. 4.

This is considered unlikely, though, because the previously mentioned isomerization data found using a 5% Pd/C catalyst was observed in a reaction run in ethanol, and in spite of the fact that the. rates of hydrogenation of both 1 and 2 over this catalyst were almost the same [8]. In our opinion, a more valid explana- tion for the marked decrease in isomerization from that normally observed with supported palladium catalysts is that with the present systems the pendant phosphine groups interact with the metal surface and that this interaction results in not only a modification of the hydrogenation capabil- ities of these catalysts but also a decrease in their isomerization capacity. Further work is presently underway to examine more fully this latter possi- bility. Summary The reaction of NazPdC^ with organophosphine-modified inorganic oxides gives catalytically active species which were shown by ESCA to contain only Pd(0) and no Pd(II). From their black color and their poisoning by Hg(0), it is apparent that these catalysts are not phosphine-ligated Pd(0) complexes [15] but, instead, are comprised of palladium metal supported on the phosphinated oxide. Thus, these catalysts may be similar to those pre- pared by the aggregation of rhodium carbonyl clusters on phosphinated polymers [16] or silica [17]. These catalysts have activities for olefin hydro- genation which are comparable to that found with commercial 5% Pd/C catalysts. Catalysts having a pendant triphenylphosphine moiety had greater activity than did those having an alkyldiphenylphosphine group. Since this fact parallels observations made concerning the rates of olefin hydrogenation with homogeneous Rh: phosphine complexes [18], it seems likely that the pendant phosphines interact with the supported Pd metal in the present catalysts and by so doing influence the hydrogenation activity; thus the catalyst system depicted in Scheme 1 can be used as a reasonable working model for this type of catalyst. The marked decrease in double bond isomer- ization observed over these catalysts as compared with that found using non- phosphinated supported Pd catalysts [8] is also probably the result of such an interaction. Further work is obviously required to more fully define the exact nature of this interaction. We propose that these catalysts be design- ated as Pd/MO^ P species or, more specifically in the cases of II and V, as Pd/A^Os i^P and Pd/A^Os R^P respectively.

Augustine 1 Liu Jiwan 2 Department of Chemistry, Seton Hall University, South Orange, NJ 07079 U.S.A. 1 Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 2 On leave from Department of Chemistry, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. Modification of silica, alumina, or silica-magnesia by attachment of pendant organophosphines gave phosphinated oxides which on treatment with Na2PdCl4 and heating gave black, catalytically active species shown to be metallic Pd supported on these modified oxides, and not supported Pd: phosphine complexes. The pendant phosphine groups interact with the Pd metal to influence the olefin hydrogenation activity and to markedly decrease the double bond isomerization capability of these catalysts.
