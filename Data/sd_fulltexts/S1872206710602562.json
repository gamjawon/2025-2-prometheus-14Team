The catalysts were characterized by N 2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscope, tempera- ture-programmed decomposition, and temperature-programmed reduction. The precursor from the modified method with added CO 2 had malachite and hydrotalcite-like phases and was more stable than that of the sample without added CO 2 . After calcination, the modified catalyst had a higher surface area, larger pore volume, and smaller particle size. The modified catalyst gave a higher activity for methanol synthesis from CO 2 hydrogenation in the reaction temperature range of 200â€“260 ÂºC. Key words: carbon dioxide assisted aging; copper; zinc oxide; alumina; hydrogenation of carbon dioxide; methanol synthesis Copper-based catalysts are used for the synthesis of methanol from syngas at 220â€“300 ÂºC and 5â€“10 MPa [1,2]. However, when the catalyst is used for CO 2 hydrogenation, the yield of methanol is much lower than that obtained from syngas under similar reaction conditions [3]. Consequently, there has been much research on the development of improved catalysts [4â€“8]. It is well-known that a small variation in the preparation process can induce changes in surface structure and bring about different reaction performances. Waller et al. [9] and Millar et al. [10] proposed an important variation in the aging period following the initial precipitation. Li and Inui [11] investigated the influence of precipitation conditions on Cu/ZnO/Al 2 O 3 catalysts and found that precipitation performed at pH = 7 resulted in a very fine inter-dispersion of CuO and ZnO after calcination. They also discussed the reaction mechanism of the co-precipitation based on the work of Vasserman et al. [12]. In this work, we modified the aging method with the adding of CO 2 to the mother solution, and investigated the effect on the physiochemical properties and activity for methanol synthesis from CO 2 and H 2 . 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation The precursors were prepared by the co-precipitation method. An aqueous solution with metal nitrates (Cu:Zn:Al = 6:3:1, molar ratio) and a sodium carbonate solution were added simultaneously with constant stirring to 300 ml of distilled water. The precipitation temperature and pH were kept at 80 ÂºC and 8.0, respectively. After precipitation, the suspension was maintained for 1 h under stirring with the adding of CO 2 to the mother solution. This was followed by filtration and washing with 500 ml warm distilled water for 5 times to remove NaNO 3 as much as possible. The precipitate was then dried at 120 ÂºC overnight and calcined in air at 350 ÂºC for 6 h. This catalyst was named CZA-1. A referenced catalyst without CO 2 assisted aging was named CZA-2. 1.2 Catalyst characterization Images from the field emission scanning electron micro- scope (FE-SEM) were obtained on a JSM-6701F instrument (JEOL). X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were per- formed on a PANalytica X'pert Pro MPD instrument using Cu WANG Danjun et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1452â€“1456 K Ä® radiation in the range of 2È™ = 10Â°â€“80Â° at a rate of 4Â°/min at 40 mA and 40 kV. The surface areas (A BET ) and pore volume (V p ) of the calcined samples were calculated from N 2 adsorp- tion-desorption data acquired at â€“196 ÂºC on a fully automated ASAP 2010 (Micromeritics) gas adsorption instrument. The powders were first outgassed at 350 ÂºC to ensure a clean sur- face. The isotherms were used according to the BET method for surface area calculation and the BJH method for the pore size distribution. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were conducted on a AMI-100 instrument. A freshly calcined catalyst sample of about 50 mg (80â€“100 mesh) was pretreated in a helium Ã€ow of 50 ml/min at 350 ÂºC for 1 h and then cooled to room temperature. After that, a reducing gas composed of 5% H 2 -95% He was employed at a Ã€ow rate of 50 ml/min, and the temperature was ramped from room temperature to 500 ÂºC at a heating rate of 10 o C/min. The hydrogen consumption was monitored online by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Temperature-programmed decomposition (TPD) was also conducted on the AMI-100 catalyst characterization instrument. The precursor sample of about 10 mg was heated to 700 ÂºC in helium flow (80 ml/min) with a heating rate of 10 ÂºC/min. The evolved gas was monitored online by a quadruple mass spec- trometer (MS, Ametek LCD-200). 1.3 Catalytic activity Activity measurements were carried out in a Â¿xed-bed mi- croreactor (i.d. 10 mm). Catalyst (0.5 ml, 20â€“40 mesh) was loaded in the reactor and the remaining space of the reactor was filled with quartz sand. The temperature was controlled by a thermocouple in contact with the catalyst bed. The pressure in the reactor was maintained by a back pressure regulator and the flow rate of the feed gas was controlled by mass flow control- lers. A cold trap was used for the separation of liquid product. Before each test, the catalyst was reduced in situ at 300 ÂºC for 6 h in 5% H 2 -95% N 2 Ã€ow (100 ml/min) at atmospheric pressure. After reduction, the reactor was cooled to the reaction tem- perature and the feed gas (H 2 :CO 2 :N 2 = 75:25:1) was supplied. An online gas chromatograph equipped with a TDX-01 column and a TCD was used for analyzing the outlet gas. The liquid product was analyzed offline by a chromatograph equipped with a flame ionizing detector (FID) and a FFAP column. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Idea of the modified strategy As discussed in the introduction, the aging can remarkably affect the structure and surface morphological properties, which, in turn, affect the activity of the final catalyst. Accord- ing to Li et al. [11], the following steps (1)â€“(3) are involved in co-precipitation. During aging, reaction (4) occurs. The release of OH by reaction (4) causes an increase in the pH value during aging according to the study of Baltes [13]. Cu 2+ + 2OH Äº Cu(OH) 2 (s) (1) 3Cu(OH) 2 (s) + Cu 2+ + 2NO 3 Äº Cu(NO 3 ) 2 Â·3Cu(OH) 2 (s) (2) Cu(OH) 2 + Cu 2+ + CO 3 2 Äº Cu 2 (OH) 2 CO 3 (s) (3) Cu(NO 3 ) 2 Â·3Cu(OH) 2 (s) + 2CO 3 2 Äº 2Cu 2 (OH) 2 CO 3 (s) + 2OH + 2NO 3 (4) The activity results reported by Bems et al. [14] suggested that keeping a constant pH value during aging, namely, inhib- iting the increase of the pH value by adding a metal nitrate to consume the OH generated in reaction (4), was favorable for the improvement of the physiochemical properties and the catalytic performance. Based on these results, we proposed introducing CO 2 during aging to consume OH by reaction (5), which would facilitate the conversion of Cu(NO 3 ) 2 Â·3Cu(OH) 2 (s) to Cu 2 (OH) 2 CO 3 (s). 2 O + CO 2 (g) Äº 2H + + CO 3 2 (5) OH + H + Äº H 2 O (6) 2.2 Physicochemical characterization The surface characterization data confirmed that the total surface area was increased to 110.8 m 2 /g by the CO 2 assisted aging method. This was 32% higher than that of CZA-2 (83.7 m 2 /g). As shown in Fig. 1(a), the CZA-1 catalyst with CO 2 assisted aging displayed a narrow pore size distribution and a higher cumulative pore volume (CPV) of ca. 0.357 cm 3 /g with maximal incremental pore volume (IPV) at the pore diameter of 15.3 nm.

Figure 2 compares the surface morphology of the two cata- lysts before calcination. With CZA-1 (Fig. 2(a)), most of the hydroxycarbonate were in the form of spheres with particle sizes of 10â€“50 nm, and numerous pores were observed. With CZA-2 (Fig. 2(b)), some spheres have collapsed and agglom- erated into larger irregular aggregates, resulting in less pores. These results are consistent with the surface area and pore volume data. The XRD patterns of the catalysts before calcination are shown in Fig. 3. The peaks at 2È™ = 14.8Â°, 17.5Â°, 24.1Â°, 31.5Â°, and 35.6Â° were ascribed to the malachite phase (Cu 2 CO 3 (OH) 2 ), and those at 2È™ = 11.9Â° and 24.1Â° were attributed to the hy- drotalcite-like phase ((Cu,Zn) 6 Al 2 (OH) 16 CO 3 Â·4H 2 O). A dif- ferent feature was observed with CZA-2. Besides the peak at 2È™ = 11.9Â° and 24.1Â° from the hydrotalcite-like phase, the peaks at 2È™ = 35.6Â° and 38.7Â° were due to the CuO phase. This indicated that the precursors of CZA-2 had decomposed to some extent. By considering the stability of the hydrotal- cite-like and malachite phases in CZA-1, it is suggested that the CuO phase in CZA-2 was probably from the decomposition of copper hydroxynitrate during the aging process from reactions (7) and (8): 2Cu 2 (OH) 2 CO 3 (s) + 2OH + 2NO 3 Äº Cu(NO 3 ) 2 Â·3Cu(OH) 2 (s) + 2CO 3 2 (7) Cu(NO 3 ) 2 Â·3Cu(OH) 2 (s) + 2OH Äº 4CuO + 2NO 3 + 4H 2 O (8) Due to this, the malachite phase in CZA-2 was slowly con- sumed. However, the introducing of CO 2 into the solution promoted reaction (3), which resulted in the formation of the hydroxycarbonate that is more stable under the aging condi- tions. In addition, the XRD patterns showed that the intensity of its malachite phase peak (2È™ = 11.9Â°) was much weaker than that with CZA-2, which implied that the crystallites of the malachite phase were smaller than that in CZA-2. This result confirmed that adding CO 2 inhibited the crystallites from growing. After calcination, the hydroxycarbonate phase in the pre- cursor was converted into the metal oxide. As shown in Fig. 4, the peaks at 2È™ = 35.4Â°, 38.6Â°, 48.5Â°, 58.0Â°, 61.5Â°, 66.0Â°, and 75.1Â° were ascribed to CuO, and that at 2È™ = 32.6Â° was due to ZnO. No Al features was found. The reason was probably because the Al species existed in highly disordered or amor- phous states due to the relatively low calcination temperature (350 ÂºC), or that the crystallites were too small to be detected. The CuO peaks of CZA-1 were weaker and broader than that of CZA-2, suggesting a smaller average CuO particle size for CZA-1. The difference in particle size between CZA-1 and CZA-2 was probably due to the different amounts of CO 2 from the decomposition of hydroxycarbonate during the calcination. CZA-1 contained much more hydroxycarbonate while CZA-2 has less because of the decomposition before the calcinations. Thus CZA-1 had much smaller particles than CZA-2.

WANG Danjun et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1452â€“1456 TPDE result, shown in Fig. 5, there were three main CO 2 re- lease steps from CZA-1 [15,16]. The evolution between 140 and 220 o C was ascribed to the decomposition of the hydro- talcite-like precursor. The release of CO 2 in the range of 220 400 o C was attributed to the first decomposition step of hydroxycarbonate and that in the range of 400 600 o C was ascribed to the second decomposition step of hydroxycarbonate. Clearly, the MS peaks from CZA-1 were much stronger than those of CZA-2, indicating that more CO 2 was given off during calcination, which resulted in a more porous CZA-1. This result agreed with the pore volume data from the N 2 adsorp- tion-desorption experiment. TPR experiments are carried out to understand the reduction behavior of the catalysts. As shown in Fig. 6, the two samples displayed reduction profiles characterized by main peaks with temperatures between 230 and 250 ÂºC. These were considera- bly lower than that of pure bulk CuO (ca. 300 ÂºC) [17]. The onset temperatures for CZA-1 and CZA-2 appeared at 146 ÂºC. A poorly resolved peak was observed for CZA-2 with a shoulder peak (247 ÂºC) on the right side of the maximum (233 ÂºC) while the shape of the peak for CZA-1 (239 ÂºC) was sharper and more symmetrical. These results verified the homogenous distribution of the components for CZA-1. 2.3 Catalytic activity The hydrogenation of CO 2 to methanol was investigated in a steel microreactor. Methanol and carbon monoxide were the major carbon-containing products. The activities of CZA-1 and CZA-2 as a function of reaction temperature in CO 2 hydro- genation reaction are shown in Fig. 7. The trend with tem- perature for the two catalysts was similar. At a low temperature (200 o C), both catalysts showed lower CO 2 conversion with a higher methanol selectivity. In the range of 200â€“260 o C, with the increase of temperature, the conversion of CO 2 increased while the selectivity for methanol decreased. At the same time, the space time yield (STY) of methanol increased with the increase of temperature in the range of 200â€“240 o C due to the increasing conversion. However, further temperature increase led to the decline of the yield of methanol due to a much de- creased methanol selectivity. The highest STY was obtained at 240 ÂºC and was 254 g/(LÂ·h) for CZA-1 and 155 g/(LÂ·h) for CZA-2. The activity of CZA-1 which was prepared by CO 2 assisted aging was much higher than that of CZA-2. 0 200 400 600 CZA-2 M S s i g n a l Temperature ( o C) CZA-1 m/z = 44 Fig. 5.

WANG Danjun et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1452â€“1456 3 Conclusions To improve the catalyst for CO 2 hydrogenation, we modified the aging during the preparation by adding CO 2 into the mother solution. CO 3 2 from dissolved CO 2 promoted the conversion of hydroxynitrate to hydroxycarbonate. The hydroxynitrate in the precursor that did not have added CO 2 decomposed before it could be converted to hydroxycarbonate. The aging-modified catalyst had a higher surface area, larger pore volume, smaller particle size, and higher catalytic activity.

Appl Catal A, 1998, 174: 231 ese results verified the homogenous distribution of the components for CZA-1. 2.3 Catalytic activity The hydrogenation of CO 2 to methanol was investigated in a steel microreactor. Methanol and carbon monoxide were the major carbon-containing products. The activities of CZA-1 and CZA-2 as a function of reaction temperature in CO 2 hydro- genation reaction are shown in Fig. 7. The trend with tem- perature for the two catalysts was similar. At a low temperature (200 o C), both catalysts showed lower CO 2 conversion with a higher methanol selectivity. In the range of 200â€“260 o C, with the increase of temperature, the conversion of CO 2 increased while the selectivity for methanol decreased. At the same time, the space time yield (STY) of methanol increased with the increase of temperature in the range of 200â€“240 o C due to the increasing conversion. However, further temperature increase led to the decline of the yield of methanol due to a much de- creased methanol selectivity. The highest STY was obtained at 240 ÂºC and was 254 g/(LÂ·h) for CZA-1 and 155 g/(LÂ·h) for CZA-2. The activity of CZA-1 which was prepared by CO 2 assisted aging was much higher than that of CZA-2. 0 200 400 600 CZA-2 M S s i g n a l Temperature ( o C) CZA-1 m/z = 44 Fig. 5.

Tel: +86-931-4968066; Fax:+86-931-4968129 A Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst prepared by adding CO2 during the aging step was used for methanol synthesis from CO2 and H2. The catalysts were characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscope, temperature-programmed decomposition, and temperature-programmed reduction. The precursor from the modified method with added CO2 had malachite and hydrotalcite-like phases and was more stable than that of the sample without added CO2. After calcination, the modified catalyst had a higher surface area, larger pore volume, and smaller particle size. The modified catalyst gave a higher activity for methanol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation in the reaction temperature range of 200-260 °C. 摘要 ：对传统共沉淀法进行改进, 在老化阶段通入 CO2 促进母液中前驱体物相的转变, 制备了 Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 催化剂. N2 吸附、X 射线衍射、场发射扫描电子显微镜、程序升温还原、程序升温分解结果表明, 改进共沉淀法制备的催化剂前驱体中碱式硝酸铜更易转变为碱式碳酸铜, 从而提高了前驱体的稳定性, 并使得焙烧后的催化剂具有较大的比表面积和孔体积及较小的颗粒. 在 200–260 °C 范围内对 CO2 加氢制甲醇活性测试表明, 改进方法制备的催化剂活性明显优于传统共沉淀法制备的催化剂.
