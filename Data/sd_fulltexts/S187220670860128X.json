DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(08)60128-X PVP-Capped Silver Nanoparticles as Catalyst for Oxidative Coupling of Thiols to Disulfides YAN Jiangmei, TAO Huiwang, ZENG Muling, TAO Jun, ZHANG Shihong, YAN Zhiying, WANG Wei, WANG Jiaqiang* Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry for Natural Resource, Ministry of Education, Department of Applied Chemistry, Yunnan University, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, China Abstract: Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-capped silver nanoparticles were used as the catalyst for the oxidative coupling of n-dodecanethiol. The product was characterized to be n-dodecyl disulfide by mass spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectros- copy, and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The effects of reaction time, temperature, catalyst concentration, and water amount on catalyst performance were examined. The optimum reaction conditions were 0.157 mmol PVP-capped silver nanoparticles, 20 Pl distilled water, reaction temperature of 100 o C, and reaction time of 3 h. The PVP-capped silver nanoparticles were also used as the catalyst for the oxidative coupling of n-butanethiol and n-octanethiol to their corresponding disulfides. Key words: polyvinylpyrrolidone; silver nanoparticle; oxidative coupling; thiol; disulfide � The oxidative coupling of thiols to disulfides is of consid- erable interest in chemical, biological, and industrial processes [1–3]. The classical chemical methods for this class of reaction use catalysts such as K 3 PO 4 [1], molecular oxygen [4], and metal ions [5]. In addition, solid base catalysts [6], cobalt phthalocyanine [7], and metalloporphyrin [8] are often used in industry. Many of these methods suffer from one or more disadvantages such as long reaction time, difficult workup, and lack of general applicability to thiol substrates. Thus, it is desirable to develop a mild and efficient method to synthesize disulfides. Noble metal nanomaterials have attracted attention because of their potential applications in catalysis, energy, electronics, and biotechnology [9]. Pradhan et al. [10] have reported the silver nanoparticle-catalyzed reduction of aromatic nitro compounds. Prasad et al. [11] have demonstrated that uncapped gold nanoparticles can be used as the catalyst for the polym- erization of alkylsilanes to one-dimensional siloxane nanowires, filaments, and tubes from RSiH 3 and water. We have used polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-capped silver nanopar- ticles as the catalyst for the polymerization of alkylsilanes to siloxane composite microspheres [12]. We have also found that AgBiS 2 microspheres synthesized by using polyethyleneglycol (PEG) as the template can catalyze the polymerization of al- kylsilanes to silanols [13]. Recently, Saxena et al. [14] have used Ni-nanoparticles as the catalyst for the chemo-selective oxidative coupling of thiols to disulfides. The catalytic oxida- tive coupling of n-dodecanethiol by silver nanometer materials has not yet been reported. In this work, PVP-capped silver nanoparticles were used as the catalyst for the oxidation of n-dodecanethiol, n-butanethiol, and n-octanethiol to their di- sulfides under atmosphere pressure at short reaction time. PVP-capped silver nanoparticles were synthesized as de- scribed by Wei et al. [12]. Ethylene glycol (EG) was used as the solvent and reducing agent. AgNO 3 (0.20 g) and PVP (0.12 g, M w = 7 000–10 000) were added into a flask containing 10 ml EG and fully dissolved. This solution was called solution A. EG (20 ml) was added into a two-necked flask under vigorous stirring, heated in an oil bath, and maintained at 150 o C for 30 min. This solution was called solution B. Solution A was added YAN Jiangmei et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(9): 856–858 dropwise into hot solution B over a period of 15 min. The reaction mixture was further heated at 150 o C for 15 min. The size of the spherical silver nanoparticles obtained was 30–100 nm. The oxidative coupling of n-dodecanethiol was carried out at atmospheric pressure as follows. PVP-capped silver nanopar- ticles (4 ml, 0.157 mmol) and 20 μl distilled water were put into a two-necked flask under vigorous stirring, heated in an oil bath, and maintained at 100 °C. Thiol (2 ml) was added into the above mixture and refluxed at 100 °C for 3 h. The obtained products were filtered and crystallized with acetone. By fol- lowing the same procedure, a blank test was also carried out. As expected, without the PVP-capped silver nanoparticles catalyst, no significant activity was observed. When silver nanoparticles were added, a significant catalytic effect was observed. The purified product was characterized by mass spectrometry (MS) conducted on a Agilent G3250AA LC/MSD TOF spectrometer, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy performed with a Thermo Nicolet 8700 instrument, laser Raman spectroscopy measured with a Spex 1403 spectrometer, and 1 H NMR spectroscopy on a 500 MHz AVANCE DPX-500 spectrometer. The molecular formula of the product could be C 24 H 50 S 2 or C 24 H 50 SO 2 based on the MS result (M + = 402.338 1). The FT-IR spectra of the product (not shown) had three bands at 3 130, 2 920, and 2 850 cm –1 , which were assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of CH 3 – and –CH 2 – in alkyl chains, and two bands at 1 460 and 1 400 cm –1 assigned to –CH 2 and –CH 3 bending vibrations. In addition, a band at 721 cm –1 due to the bending vibration of –(CH 2 ) n (n > 4) was also observed. The bands for the S–S bond of a disulfide at 492 and 525 cm –1 were observed in the Raman spectra (not shown). Five groups of absorptions at different chemical shifts (centered at / = 2.7, 1.7, 1.4, 1.3, and 0.9) corresponding to five different sets of protons were present in 1 H NMR spectra (not shown). The chemical shifts are summarized in Table 1 and the assignments are as follows. The triplet at / = 2.7 was attributed to the methylene next to the S–S bond. The triplet at / = 1.4 was assigned to the methylene attached to methylene and me- thylene groups. The triplet at / = 0.9 was assigned to the methyl next to the methylene groups. The multiplet at / = 1.7 was assigned to the methylene attached to two methylenes. The large narrow singlet at / = 1.3 was attributed to the methylene groups. Based on the above, the molecular formula of the product from the oxidative coupling of n-dodecanethiol catalyzed by PVP-capped silver nanoparticles was concluded to be C 24 H 50 S 2 . In order to optimize the conversion, the products were fol- lowed using an Agilent 6890N/5973N gas chromatograph- mass spectrometer. The effects of reaction time, reaction temperature, catalyst concentration, and amount of water on the catalyst performance were examined. The results are summarized in Table 2. The effect of reaction time (Entries 1–3) showed that the n-dodecanethiol conversion and the se- lectivity for n-dodecyl disulfide increased with increasing reaction time and passed through a maximum at 5 h. The effect of reaction temperature (Entries 3–5) showed that the n-dodecanethiol conversion and the selectivity for n-dodecyl disulfide decreased with the increase in reaction temperature, and the highest conversion and selectivity were at 100 o C. The effect of catalyst concentration (Entries 6–8) showed that the n-dodecanethiol conversion and the selectivity for n-dodecyl Table 1 The assignments of 1 H NMR spectra of the products of oxidative coupling of n-dodecanethiol S SCH 2 CH 2 CH 2 (CH 2 ) 8 CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 (CH 2 ) 8 CH 3 BC D EA Assignment Shift ( / ) A 2.7 B 1.7 C 1. 4 D 1. 3 E 0.9 Table 2 Results of the oxidative coupling of n-dodecanethiol over silver nanoparticles Entry Catalyst (mmol) Water ( Pl) Temperature ( o C) Time (h) Conversion of n-dodecanethiol (%) Selectivity for n-dodecyl disulfide (%) TOF (h –1 ) 1 0.157 20 120 1 21.1 79.3 4.46 2 0.157 20 120 3 71.3 87.7 5.56 3 0.157 20 120 5 76.7 93.4 3.82 4 0.157 20 100 5 96.6 98.9 5.09 5 0.157 20 140 5 17.4 61.5 0.57 6 0.078 20 100 3 7.2 83.9 1.08 7 0.157 20 100 3 93.5 99.6 8.28 8 0.235 20 100 3 82.4 93.3 4.55 9 0.157 200 120 5 42.4 66.9 1.51 10 0.157 2000 120 5 23.7 71.0 0.90 Reaction conditions: C 12 H 25 SH 2 ml.

YAN Jiangmei et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(9): 856–858 disulfide increased when the amount of the catalyst was in- creased up to 0.157 mmol. Beyond this amount, the conversion of n-dodecanethiol and selectivity for n-dodecyl disulfide decreased. The effect of the amount of water present (Entries 3, 9, and 10) showed that the n-dodecanethiol conversion de- creased when the amount of water was increased from 20 Pl to 2 000 Pl. Therefore, 20 Pl water was enough for this reaction. Table 2 also shows that n-dodecanethiol conversion increased with reaction time up to 5 h while the selectivity for n-dodecyl disulfide slightly decreased, which was probably because n-dodecyl disulfide was oxidized at longer reaction time. Among the entries, Entry 7 has the highest TOF. Therefore, the optimum reaction conditions were that of Entry 7, i.e., 0.157 mmol PVP-capped silver nanoparticles, 20 Pl distilled water, reaction temperature of 100 o C, and reaction time of 3 h. The PVP-capped silver nanoparticles were also used as the catalyst for the oxidative coupling of n-butanethiol and n-octanethiol under the reaction conditions of 0.157 mmol PVP-capped silver nanoparticles, 2 ml thiol, 20 Pl distilled water, reaction temperature of 120 o C, and reaction time of 5 h. The products were characterized with a SHIMADZU UV- 2401PC spectrophotometer (Fig. 1), which showed the char- acteristic absorption peaks of aliphatic disulfides at 260 nm [6]. The TOF of the oxidative coupling of n-butanethiol and n-octanethiol were 4.27 and 2.61 h –1 , respectively. Saxena et al. [14] used Ni nanoparticles as the catalyst and reported that the TOF for the oxidative coupling of n-butanethiol and n-octanethiol were 0.040 and 0.026 h –1 , respectively. It is seen that the catalytic activity of the PVP-capped silver nanoparti- cles was much higher than that of the Ni nanoparticles for the oxidative coupling of thiols. No product was obtained when the oxidative coupling of thiols catalyzed by PVP-capped silver nanoparticles was car- ried out under a N 2 atmosphere. This suggested that O 2 played an important role in the process. In the reaction, the smaller size of the silver nanoparticles gave a higher specific surface area, and adsorbed more O 2 from the air and thiols on their surface. Therefore, O 2 and thiols were in sufficient contact, which promoted the oxidative coupling of thiols. In summary, PVP-capped silver nanoparticles were suc- cessfully used as the catalyst for the oxidative coupling of n-dodecanethiol, n-butanethiol, and n-octanethiol with trace water to their disulfides. We believe that the synthetic strategy demonstrated here can be extended to other thiols. References 1 Joshi A V, Bhusare S, Baidossi M, Qafisheh N, Sasson Y.
