VISWANATHAN Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras 600 036 (India) (Received March 15, 1984; accepted June 8, 1984) Summary Various model clusters have been chosen to simulate the surfaces of phosphate catalysts (phosphoric acid, boron phosphate, aluminum phos- phate and silicon phosphate). Semi-empirical CNDO/2 calculations have been performed, and the calculated electronic parameters are utilized to predict the surface acid-base characteristics of these catalysts and the effect of water adsorption. The order of acidity and basicity of these catalysts as predicted from the calculated values of HOMO and LUMO energy levels is in semi-quantitative agreement with experimental observation. Introduction Phosphates have been found to catalyze a variety of reactions such as isomerization, polymerization, partial oxidation and ammoxidation of olefins, dehydration and dehydrogenation of alcohols and alkylation of hydrocarbons [1]. Phosphoric acid and metal phosphates are polar catalysts possessing both acidic and basic surface properties. The existence of acid- base sites on the surface of phosphate catalysts has been probed through the use of a number of experimental procedures involving the chemisorption of gases, electron spin resonance, nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopy of chemisorbed species, isotopic exchange, liquid-phase titra- tions with Hammett indicators, and the study of catalytic reactions pro- moted by such sites. However, relatively little work has been reported on either the source and nature of these acid-base sites, or their dependence on the cation [2]. *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/85/$3.30 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 172 However, the a and TT bonding of the orthophosphate ion has been analyzed by Urch [3] using atomic absorption spectral data. Johansen [4] has re- ported a& initio calculations on the orthophosphate ion for the purpose of comparison with other oxyanions. Hojer et al. [5] have compared the results from CNDO calculations on the orthophosphate ion with those found from a& initio calculations. The present studies have been initiated to compare acid-base sites on alumina, silica, silica-alumina and the phosphates of boron, aluminum and silicon. Method The results of theoretical studies of a large number of solid surfaces and chemisorbed species with a variety of computational techniques have been reported, and a number of excellent reviews are available [6, 7]. The semi- empirical CNDO/2 method has been used to perform the cluster calculation [8]. While ab initio techniques have a number of advantages, particularly for atoms containing a relatively small number of electrons, semi-empirical techniques involve a smaller commitment of computer time. Although values of the quantities calculated by the latter methods may differ considerably from the expected values, nevertheless evidence exists for the validity of these values on a relative basis [6, 7]. Application of the CNDO/2 method to clusters representing zeolites has recently been reported [9]. Phosphoric acid and orthophosphates of cations (T) such as boron, aluminum and silicon exist in polymorphous silica structure. In this structure both phosphorus and the cation T (where T = B, AI or Si) are tetrahedrally coordinated to four oxygen atoms. Alternate tetrahedra of PC>4 and TO^ are bridged by oxygen atoms to form a continuous three-dimensional array. In the present calculation, a cluster model with two tetrahedral units is chosen to simulate the surface of phosphate catalysts. The tetrahedral arrays are terminated by attaching hydrogen to the oxygen atoms, which will represent the ideal situation occurring on the surface, where surface hydroxyl groups exist due to the presence of water in the atmosphere. The bond parameters (Table 1 ) used in these calculations are values reported by TABLE 1 Values of bond parameters used for the model calculations Cluster Bond lengths (nm) Bond angles P 0 T-O\" 0-H all T O T and T O H\" P 2 0.1516 - 0.0980 109 29' BP 0.1540 0.1440 0.0980 109 29' A1P 0.1516 0.1700 0.0980 109 29' SiP 0.1516 0.1700 0.0980 109 29' T = B, Al, Si. 173 Moffat [1]. The values of the calculated parameters, such as binding energy, position of molecular energy levels and electronic charge densities on various atoms of the cluster, are employed to provide indications of the acid-base character. Results Alumina, silica and phosphoric acid clusters The clusters chosen to represent alumina (a), silica (b) and phosphoric acid (c) and the calculated charge distribution on various atoms of the cluster are shown in Fig. 1. The comparison of charge densities is shown in Table 2. It is apparent that the cations with maximum positive charge are the Lewis acidic sites, while the bridging oxygen atoms with maximum negative charge are the Lewis basic sites. The protons of the hydroxyl groups must be acting as the Bronsted acid sites.

The electronic charge densities on various atoms of these clusters are summarized in Table 3. The exposed oxygen atoms are found to have the maximum electronic density and hence function as Lewis basic sites. On the basis of the magnitude of positive charge on cations, it is inferred that the silicon atoms function as acidic sites in silica-alumina and phosphorus atoms function as the acidic site in boron phosphate, aluminum phosphate and silicon phosphate. Bronsted acidity of these catalysts is due to protons attached to exposed oxygen, since these possess maximum positive charge. 176 TABLE 3 Electronic charges on various atoms of clusters (Fig. 2) Clusters SiAl BP A1P SiP Atoms cationsbridging 0; (Ob) exposed 0; (Og)tetrahedral 0; (0(d) HofOg HofOfd (i) (ii)(i) (ii)(i) (ii)(i) (ii)(i) (ii) +1.51 +1.30 0.52 0.48 0.52 0.39 0.50+0.16 0.01+0.10 +0.01 +1.29 +0.44 0.41-0.48 -0.49 0.41 -0.36+0.27 +0.39+0.16 +0.11 +1.29 +1.14 0.57 0.64 0.64-0.43 0.50+0.35 +0.47+0.14 +0.10 +1.45 +1.14 0.55-0.65 0.60 0.37 0.29+0.35 +0.47+0.19 +0.17 'Atom (i) refers to silicon in aluminum silicate and phosphorus in phosphates; atom (ii) refers to aluminum in aluminum silicate and the other cations T (where T = B, AI and Si) in phosphates. Effect of water adsorption on phosphate catalysts The surface hydroxyl groups found in these catalysts result from the dissociation of adsorbed water. In addition, water is often a product in reactions catalyzed by these solids. Since water plays a vital role in control- ling the activity of these catalysts, the effect of the adsorption of water vapour on these catalysts has been studied by various experimental tech- niques [10]. The presence of water in small amounts has been shown to be essential for the observed catalytic activity. However, water in larger amounts alters the surface and bulk properties and eventually the activity of the catalyst [11]. The electronic interaction between water and the catalyst and the effect of water on the charge distribution of the cluster may be analyzed from the results of the present calculations. It may reasonably be assumed that the water molecule is bonded to cations through its lone pair of oxygen electrons. The energetically most favourable adsorption of water follows a path directed toward the cation and centered between the three nearest oxygen atoms forming the tetrahedral base (Figs. 3 and 4). The possibility of the adsorption of water on either the phosphorus atom or on the other cation T (where T = B, AI or Si) has been examined. The configurations considered and their charge distributions are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. While the magnitudes of the charges are somewhat altered, the acidic and basic characteristics of the catalysts remain unchanged. The charge densities on 176 +0-3A ,-036 Fig. 3. Calculated charge densities for the adsorption of water on the phosphorus atom of various phosphates: (a) phosphoric acid, (b) boron phosphate, (c) aluminum phosphate and (d) silicon phosphate. some of the atoms in the cluster before and after adsorption of water are given in Tables 4 and 5. The energy values of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) and the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) are indications of the electron pair-donating and electron pair-accepting capabilities of these catalysts. The Lewis acidic and basic sites may be identified by noting the atoms providing the major contributions to the HOMO and LUMO wave- functions (Table 6). Discussion Alumina, silica and phosphoric acid clusters In clusters representing alumina, silica and phosphoric acid (Fig. 1), the positive charge on the cations increased in the order Al < Si < P, which is the order of the Lewis acidity. The bridged oxygen can be seen to have the largest magnitude of negative charge of all oxygen atoms present, and must presumably be the Lewis basic site. The magnitude of the negative charge on the bridging oxygen atoms, which is indicative of the Lewis basicity, in- creases in the reverse order to that observed for the Lewis acidity.

The order of Bronsted acidity as related to the charge on the hydrogen is Al < Si < P. The results of these calculations predict that phosphoric acid is pre- dominantly acidic, alumina is predominantly basic and silica is intermediate in acid-base characteristics. This is in accord with the well-known experi- mental observation that phosphoric acid catalyzes dehydration and hy- drolysis reactions which require acidic sites, while reactions such as aldol condensations are promoted by alumina. Silica is found to be a mild catalyst with both acidic and basic sites [12]. Silica-alumina and various phosphate clusters In silica-alumina, the charge density on the bridging oxygen (bonded to both Si and Al) is comparable to that on exposed oxygen (bonded to a cation and hydrogen). However, in phosphates the exposed oxygen has a higher charge density than the bridging oxygen, and the wave function of the HOMO has maximum contribution from 2s and 2p orbitais of exposed oxygen. This may be due to the larger difference in the electronegativity of the cations in various phosphates, and also due to varying P 0 and T 0 distances in phosphates (while in silica-alumina both Si 0 and AI 0 dis- tances are the same (1.65 A)). The polarity in the cluster, and consequently 179 TABLE 6 Values of Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) and Lowest Unoccupied Molec- ular Orbital (LUMO) and the main atoms contributing to these levels Structure Clusters HOMO (a.u.)

''Atoms contributing major components for the formation of MO. the electronic charge distribution, is primarily dependent on the oxygen- metal distances and the electronegativity of the cations. The present calcula- tions indicate that the Lewis acidity of silica-alumina is stronger than that of phosphates, while the Bronsted acidity is higher in the latter where the protons have greater positive charge. In the phosphates the order of Lewis acidic strength is BP A1P < SiP, while the order of Bronsted acidity is BP < A1P ^ SiP and the Lewis basicity order is BP < A1P SiP. Effect of water adsorption on phosphate catalysts It is evident from the results of the calculations that the effect of the adsorption of water is primarily restricted to a change in the charge densities within the tetrahedron to which water becomes adsorbed (Tables 4 and 5). Since the water molecule apparently adsorbed on the cation, the latter is effectively eliminated as a Lewis acid site. In addition, the magnitude of the positive charge on the cation of the adjacent tetrahedron, as well as that of the hydrogen atoms of the substrate, is reduced. The values calculated for the overlap suggest that the hydrogen bonding between the oxygen of the water molecule and the hydrogen atoms attached to the tetrahedral oxygen atoms is relatively weak. The increase in the charge densities on the exposed oxygen atoms may account for the Lewis basicity. 180 Conclusions It is evident from the present work that simple semi-empirical calcula- tions, while no doubt in considerable error on an absolute basis, are of value in predicting the relative acid-base properties of polar solids. With the pres- ent catalysts, the cations are found to be the Lewis acid sites, the oxygen atoms are Lewis basic sites and the protons of the surface hydroxyl group are responsible for the Bronsted acidity. Small amounts of water are ap- parently required to generate Bronsted acidity, while water in larger quan- tities acts as a poison by decreasing the positive charge on the hydrogen atoms and by blocking the Lewis acid sites. Further studies on larger clusters should facilitate the inclusion of effects due to changes in the relative amounts of cations and phosphorus on both the electron distribution and the catalytic activity. Discrimination of the acidic strength of various possible surface hydroxyl protons may then be possible. References 1 J. B. Moffat, Catal. Reu. Sei. Eng., 18 (1978) 199. 2 J. B. Moffat and B.
