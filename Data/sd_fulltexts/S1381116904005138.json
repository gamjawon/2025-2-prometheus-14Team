Hydrogenation of nitroarenes using polybenzimidazole-supported rhodium catalyst R. Mary Magdalene E.G. Leelamani N.M. Nanje Gowda * Department of Chemistry, Central College Campus, Bangalore University, Bangalore-560001, India * Corresponding author. Graphical Abstract Polybenzimidazole (PBI)-supported rhodium PBI-Rh(I) catalyst was prepared and characterised by chemical analysis, IR, TGA and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Sodium borohydride was used to produce active species of the catalyst. The anchored catalyst PBI-Rh(I) was found to be effective for the reduction of nitrophenols, nitrobenzoic acids and nitroanilines in methanol at room temperature and at 1atm hydrogen. The influence of temperature, concentrations of the catalyst and substrate and nature of the solvent on the reaction rates was investigated. The recycling efficiency of the catalyst was found to be good. A probable mechanism for the catalytic reaction has been suggested. Keywords Polymer-supported catalyst Polybenzimidazole Rhodium species Hydrogenation of nitroaromatics 1 Introduction The preparation of catalysts by immobilizing active transition metal complexes on solid supports such as organic polymers and inorganic supports has attracted widespread attention [1]. The renewed interest in the field of polymer metal complexes as catalysts is partly due to the development of nitrogen-containing ligands. Polymer supports associated with nitrogen-containing ligands have been studied because of their stability to oxidation [2]. Though the field of polymer metal complexes as catalysts in organic synthesis has remained active over the last four decades, much of the research work has been mainly concentrated to the hydrogenation of alkenes, alkynes and dienes. Relatively, little attention has been paid to the reduction of nitro compounds [3]. Li and Frechet [4] have reported the catalytic hydrogenation of nitro compounds and alkenes at room temperature using polybenzimidazole (PBI)-supported Pd0 catalysts. Use of rhodium complexes containing benzimidazole ligands as homogeneous catalysts in the reduction of nitroarenes have been reported from these laboratories [5]. Further, we have also reported the catalytic activity of PBI-RhCl3 in the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of nitrophenols and nitrobenzoic acids using formic acid as hydrogen donor in methanol [6]. With this in view we have examined PBI-supported Rh(I) complexes for their catalytic activity in the reduction of nitro compounds. Herein we report the results obtained under ambient conditions of temperature and pressure. 2 Materials and methods Polybenzimidazole (PBI; Fig. 1 ) resin (250–500μm diameter, microporous Celanese Corporation, Charlotte) beads were used as such. Methanol, acetone and DMF were purified according to literature methods [7]. Nitrobenzoic acids and nitroanilines were recrystallised from methanol and nitrophenols were used as such. [RhCl (cod)]2 (cod = cycloocta-1,5-diene) was prepared as per literature method [8]. The catalyst PBI-Rh(I) was prepared as follows: A mixture of [RhCl(cod)]2 (0.375g) with PBI (5.0g) in acetone (150cm3) under nitrogen atmosphere was refluxed for 5h. Cream-coloured metal complex beads obtained were washed with acetone followed by methanol. Subsequently, the beads were dried under vacuum. The rhodium content in the catalyst beads determined by spectrophotometry [9] was found to be 55mgg−1 of dry polymer. From elemental analysis nitrogen content was found to be 8.78%. The N/Rh atomic ratio was found to be 11.7. The IR spectrum of the catalyst beads was recorded in KBr. The spectrum exhibited bands at 1626 and 1284cm−1 and these were assigned to νCN and νC–N, respectively. The XPS of the catalytic species was recorded and the spectrum showed binding energies at 307.6 and 311.0eV corresponding to Rh 3d5/2 and 3d3/2. These values are characteristic of Rh(I). The binding energy of 198.9eV is assigned to Cl 2p and is suggestive of −1 oxidation state for the rhodium-bound chloride. Thus, the catalytic species predominantly contained rhodium in +1 oxidation state. Accordingly the polymer has remained neutral wherein PBI is co-ordinated to the metal via pyridine type of nitrogen (–NC) and not the pyrrole type of nitrogen. The XPS data of the recycled species of the catalyst showed peaks at 306.9 and 311.8eV assignable to Rh 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 in the zero oxidation state. It is likely that there is gradual reduction of Rh(I) to rhodium metal as the catalyst is recycled. TGA studies were conducted on the catalytic species, according to which they are stable upto 360 °C. The experimental details of hydrogenation were as reported earlier [10]. The hydrogenation rate was determined by measuring the uptake of hydrogen as a function of time at constant pressure. The reduced products of the substrate obtained in the molecular hydrogenation experiments were characterised based on their melting points, IR spectra and gas liquid chromatographic experiments (in a few cases). 3 Results and discussion Physical properties of the polymer support and the catalyst are listed in Table 1 . The surface area of the catalyst is observed to be higher than that of the polymer beads and this is attributed to complex formation with rhodium. The polymeric support showed swelling in different solvents but the extent of swelling is not found to influence the reaction rate. Though methanol is a better swelling solvent than ethanol, the rate of reduction of the substrate is higher in the latter solvent than in the former (Table 2 ). It is most probable that metal is on the surface of the catalyst. Polar protic solvents such as alcohols favour the reaction. For instance, non-polar solvents do not favour the reaction and thus the reduction of the substrate in benzene is almost negligible. In DMF, the catalyst, on addition of sodium borohydride dissolved to form a deep brown solution and this did not exhibit any catalytic activity. Among different solvents, methanol was selected to carry out reactions because of higher hydrogen solubility and polarity with its less complexing ability. The catalytic hydrogenation of various aromatic nitrocompounds in presence of PBI-Rh(I) catalyst results in the formation of the corresponding amines. Turn-over numbers, the percentage of reduction of the substrates and time are given in Table 3 . The reduction reactions of o-nitrobenzoic acid were repeated with different concentrations of catalyst and substrate. The experiments were conducted under ambient conditions with respect to hydrogen pressure. The reaction solution was saturated with hydrogen and considered to be saturated with hydrogen at all times. The kinetic data obtained from each experiment could be fitted into a first-order plot of log(a−x) versus ‘t’ where ‘a’ is the initial substrate concentration in moldm−3 and ‘x’ is the amount of substrate reduced at time ‘t’ (Fig. 2 ). The concentrations of the substrate were back calculated from the volume of hydrogen absorbed at different time intervals taking that 3 moles of hydrogen were absorbed for every mole of the substrate. From the linear plots it can be concluded that the rate of consumption of the substrate is of the first-order. Experiments at different substrate concentrations show direct dependence of rate on the first power of substrate concentration (Fig. 3 ). The influence of the catalyst concentration on the rate of reduction of o-nitrobenzoic acid in the range 7 × 10−4 to 9.6 × 10−4 gatomRhdm−3 at a constant substrate concentration of 0.066moldm−3 at 308K and 1atm. pressure was determined (Fig. 4 ). The order of the reaction calculated from the linear plot of log[initial rate] versus log[catalyst] was found to be fractional (plot not given). This might be due to the non-availability of catalytic sites or due to steric hindrance. The PBI-Rh(I) complex behaves as active catalyst only upon addition of a small amount of sodium borohydride. The catalyst beads turned grey in presence of sodium borohydride on equilibration with hydrogen. This probably contained a hydrido complex in the solvated form [5,10]. A mechanism similar to that proposed for the reduction of nitro group in nitroaryls in presence of homogeneous catalyst RhCl(cod) bzlH (bzlH = benzimidazole) can be envisaged [5]. One can therefore visualize the following steps for the reduction of nitroaryl to amine in presence of the catalyst. Ar N O 2 ⟶ − H 2 O 2 H Ar NO ⟶ 2 H Ar NHOH ⟶ − H 2 O 2 H Ar N H 2 Similar observation has been made by other workers [11]. The kinetics of hydrogenation of p-nitrophenol in the temperature range 298–318K at a constant concentration of substrate and a fixed amount of the catalyst was studied. The rate of reaction was found to be dependent on the temperature of the system. The energy of activation calculated from the slope of the plot of log k versus 1/T was 76.5kJmol−1 (Fig. 5 ). 4 Recycling efficiency The recycling efficiency of the catalyst was assessed taking p-nitrophenol as the substrate. The observed rates of reduction are given in Table 4 . The activity of the catalyst dropped to 82% of its initial value when it was recycled five times. Thus, the catalyst has a good recycling efficiency. The XPS data of the recycled catalyst indicated the presence of Rh(0) and chloride-free surface. Therefore, it could be inferred that rhodium metal was formed on the polymer as a result of H2 reduction of the supported rhodium under reaction conditions [12].

        "dc:description": "Polybenzimidazole (PBI)-supported rhodium PBI-Rh(I) catalyst was prepared and characterised by chemical analysis, IR, TGA and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Sodium borohydride was used to produce active species of the catalyst. The anchored catalyst PBI-Rh(I) was found to be effective for the reduction of nitrophenols, nitrobenzoic acids and nitroanilines in methanol at room temperature and at 1atm hydrogen. The influence of temperature, concentrations of the catalyst and substrate and nature of the solvent on the reaction rates was investigated. The recycling efficiency of the catalyst was found to be good. A probable mechanism for the catalytic reaction has been suggested.",
