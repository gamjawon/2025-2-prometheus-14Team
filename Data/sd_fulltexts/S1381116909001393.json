Graphical abstract Active supported catalysts for ethylene polymerization are derived from reaction of zirconocene aluminohydride complexes with methylaluminoxane-treated silica. Depending on the method of activation, polymerization activity and polymer MW are significantly increased compared with the corresponding dichloride complexes. Ethylene polymerization using catalysts derived from activation of zirconocene aluminohydride complexes, supported on silica, pretreated with methylaluminoxane (MAO), is described. The novel catalyst compositions were compared to those using conventional zirconocene dichloride complexes and characterized by SEM/EDX and DRIFT spectroscopy. Supported catalysts were prepared which featured various surface Al:Zr ratios. When using excess MAO as both activator and scavenger, the catalysts containing the most Zr per g of support gave rise to the most active formulations; the high activities in the presence of excess MAO are due, in part, to catalyst leaching prior to and/or during polymerization. When tri-isobutylaluminum (TIBAL) was used as scavenger, the supported catalysts that featured a higher surface Al:Zr ratio had higher activity than those prepared at the lower Al:Zr ratios. The activity of the aluminohydride complexes was significantly higher than that of the corresponding dichloride complexes, when activated by MAO while the in the presence of TIBAL, there was little difference in performance between the two catalyst precursors. Keywords Polymerization Metallocene Supported DRIFT Aluminohydride 1 Introduction Supported catalysts based on metallocene complexes of the group 4 elements are in commercial use for the production of poly(olefins). While a wide variety of approaches to the supporting of metallocene complexes have been investigated [1], by far the most common approach involves reaction of a metallocene dichloride with silica that has been pre-treated with methylaluminoxane (MAO) or with an alkylaluminum compound that can generate MAO on the support [2]. These chemically treated supports chemisorb significant quantities of metallocene dichloride complexes, though not all of the metal on the support is alkylated or activated for olefin polymerization. In particular, the patent literature emphasizes the use of supported catalysts where the surface Al:Zr ratio is between 100:1 and 10:1 as giving rise to the most active formulations based on the amount of Zr present [2]. In contrast, less work has been focused on the use of metallocene dialkyls or related compounds as supported catalyst precursors, despite the generally higher chemoselectivity such complexes exhibit on reaction with hydroxylated supports (i.e. exclusive reaction at the Zr-R bond [3]) and the ease with which such supported catalysts can be activated using e.g. reduced quantities of MAO [3g]. On the other hand, using MAO- or alkylaluminum-treated silica supports, there is no compelling advantage to using such precursors [4]. Two years ago we reported that zirconocene aluminohydride complexes (generically Cp2ZrH3AlH2 [5]) could serve as precursors to single-site ethylene polymerization catalysts using either MAO or B(C6F5)3 as activators [6]. On activation with MAO in solution, these complexes exhibited superior activity to the corresponding dichloride complexes (ca. 40–50% higher activity) while furnishing polymer with higher molecular weights (by up to a factor of two). Based on multi-nuclear NMR spectroscopic studies, ionization of these polynuclear complexes with B(C6F5)3 furnished polynuclear catalysts at low T in solution (e.g. Eq. (1)). (1) It is known that catalyst nuclearity can significantly influence both activity and MW in constrained geometry catalysts or phenoxyimine complexes that feature dinuclear catalysts or catalyst precursors [7]. It is thus tempting to attribute the differences seen to the differing nuclearity of the catalyst precursors (or catalysts) in the case of the aluminohydride complexes. In view of these attractive features we have investigated the preparation of supported versions of these catalysts and report here our results. In particular, we provide DRIFT spectroscopic evidence that these polynuclear catalyst precursors are supported on MAO-treated silica intact. 2 Experimental 2.1 General data All operations were carried out on a standard high vacuum line or in a dry-box under inert atmosphere. Toluene, diethyl ether, and benzene, were reagent grade, distilled from the appropriate drying agents under Ar atmosphere. Tri-iso-butylaluminum (Aldrich), MAO (10% toluene, Aldrich) and LiAlH4 (1M, Et2O, Aldrich) were used as purchased. The compounds (n-BuCp)2ZrCl2 [8] and (TMSCp)2ZrCl2 [9] were prepared by literature methods. Polymer molecular weights were determined by gel permeation chromatography using a Waters 150-C chromatograph eluting with 1,2,4-tricholorobenzene at 135°C. Narrow MWD polystyrene standards were used for GPC calibration. For GPC analyses conducted at the University of Akron, a 3-angle, miniDAWN-HT light scattering detector was used for absolute molar mass determination along with the same instrumentation, solvent and protocol. Please see ref. [10] for a discussion of molar mass distributions measured in this manner – they are invariably too narrow due to an upward (and spurious) trend in MW indicated by light-scattering at long elution volumes with polydisperse polyolefin samples. 2.2 Synthesis of Cp2ZrH3AlH2 complexes [Cp=TMSCp, nBuCp] Complexes (TMSCp)2ZrH3AlH2 and (n-BuCp)2ZrH3AlH2 were synthesized using the methods reported by Stephan and co-workers [5b,c] varying the solvent and temperature of reaction. 2.3 Preparation of nBuCp2ZrH3AlH2 A suspension of (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 (1.3g, 3.2mmoles) in 20mL of ether was prepared in a 100mL Schlenk flask under Ar. A solution of LiAlH4 in ether (1.01M, 7.0mL 7.07mmoles) was added slowly at 0°C via syringe. After 30min at 0°C, the mixture was filtered to remove LiCl and excess LiAlH4 and the filtrate concentrated to dryness in vacuo to provide crude product in quantitative yield. The crude product was extracted into toluene, filtered, and the filtrate concentrated to dryness in vacuo to provide material that was free of diethyl ether, as a white, air-sensitive powder, that was sparingly soluble in common organic solvents; a satisfactory combustion analysis was not obtained. FT-IR (Nujol) 3090 (Cp-H), 1820 (s, br, AlHt), 1560 (s, ZrHt), 1330 (br, ZrHbrAl), 1260, 1100, 1040cm−1. 1H NMR (300MHz, o-DCB-d4, −55°C) δ 5.95 (m, 2H, Cp), 5.90 (m, 2H, Cp), 5.84 (m, 2H, Cp), 5.74 (m, 2H, Cp), 3.60 (br m, 2H, AlH2), 2.77 (t, 4H, CpCH 2 nPr), 1.71 (m, 4H, CpCH2(CH 2 )2Me), 1.50 (m, 4H, CpCH2(CH 2 )2Me), 1.11 (t, 6H, CpCH2(CH2)2 Me), −1.34 (br m, H, ZrH2Al), −1.97 (br m, H, ZrH2Al). The signal due to Zr-Ht was obscured by residual protonated solvent in these spectra. 3 Preparation of silica supports 3.1 Thermal treatment Thirty to 40g of silica gel was weighed into a porcelain crucible and heated in a muffle furnace at 800°C for 6h. After this, it was transferred to a 250mL Schlenk vessel and cooled in vacuo for a further 8h. In the case of PQ silica, a 60×4cm glass column was packed with silica and heated in a tube furnace to 600°C under vacuum for 2h. It was then exposed to a flow of oxygen for 3h at 600°C and then cooled under a stream of N2 to room temperature. It was stored in a glove-box prior to use. 3.2 Modification of silica gel with MAO Dehydroxylated silica (5g) was placed in a 250mL Schlenk flask, and suspended in 50mL of toluene under Ar. A solution of MAO in toluene (22mL of 10wt%, 33mmol MAO) was added slowly at 0°C with stirring. Alter the addition was complete, the suspension was warmed to 25°C and stirred for 6h at this temperature. The silica was then filtered through a medium frit and washed three times with anhydrous toluene to remove excess MAO. It was then dried in vacuo to provide a white, granular powder which turned yellow-brown when exposed to air. A similar procedure was used for PQ silica using 1g of silica suspended in 10mL of toluene and adding 15mL of 10wt% MAO solution. After adding the MAO solution at 0°C, the mixture was heated to 50°C for 2h, and then stirred at 25°C for an additional 3h before filtering and drying as above. 3.3 Impregnation of MAO modified silica gel with nBuCp2ZrH3AlH2 A freshly prepared sample of nBuCp2ZrH3AlH2 (40mg, 0.11mmol, corresponding to ca. 5wt% Zr) was dissolved in toluene solution and added to a suspension of MAO modified silica gel (2g) in toluene at 0°C under Ar. The suspension was warmed to 25°C and stirred for 6h under Ar. The supported catalyst was filtered under Ar and washed three times with dry toluene and dried in vacuo to provide a pink-colored powder, which turned pale yellow on exposure to air. The percentages of Zr and Al of the supported catalysts were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy or by ICP analysis. A typical ICP analysis (Table 1 , entry 6) is reported below: Oxide SiO2 Al2O3 Fe2O3 CaO MgO TiO2 Na2O K2O P2O5 ZrO2 wt% 88.5 8.37 0.04 0.21 <0.01 0.03 0.19 <0.01 <0.01 0.31 wt% Al=8.37×[(2×26.98)/(2×26.98+3×15.995)]−0.23×(26.98/91.22)=4.36 wt% Zr=0.23 3.4 Catalyst characterization by DRIFT spectroscopy The supported catalysts were analyzed as powders in a DRIFT accessory, equipped with sampling cups, under an inert atmosphere. The spectra were recorded at room temperature using a Nicolet Magna 500 FTIR spectrometer, by co-adding 50 scans at a resolution of 1cm−1. The spectral range was restricted to 4000–600cm−1. The spectra were collected in reflectance mode and the interferogram transformed using the Kubelka–Munk algorithm. The DRIFT spectra depicted in Fig. 2 have been base-line corrected using a polynomial fit. 3.5 Polymerization procedure—activation with MAO The supported or soluble catalysts were activated using 5.0mL of a 10wt% solution of MAO in toluene (7.54mmol of MAO), and in all the cases the solutions and suspensions were transferred by gas-tight syringe to the reactor. Polymerizations were carried out in a 600mL Parr reactor equipped with mass flow meter and temperature control. Before each reaction, the reactor was heated up for 1h to 90°C with AlEt3/toluene to remove all moisture traces. Polymerization conditions for all the runs were: ethylene pressure of 3.9bar, 200mL of i-octane, 4.0mL of a 13wt% solution of MMAO (modified methylaluminoxane: an aliphatic hydrocarbon soluble aluminoxane formed by hydrolysis of a mixture of AlMe3 and TIBAL) in isoParE (Akzo-Nobel) and polymerization temperatures of 25, 50 or 75°C. The monomer flow rate was continually monitored through the mass flow meter and polymerizations were carried out for 30min. The polymerization was stopped by rapid depressurization of the reactor and quenching with acidified methanol (10wt% HCl). Then, the polymers were washed several times with methanol, filtered and dried in a vacuum oven during 4h. Melting temperatures were between 133 and 137°C indicating the formation of high density poly(ethylene). 4 Leaching experiments For the catalyst leaching experiments, the supported catalyst (∼50mg, 8.1μmol of Zr), and co-catalyst MAO (6.7mL, 10wt% solution in toluene, Al:Zr=1000) were stirred in a 100mL Schlenk flask at room temperature under Ar atmosphere, for 10min. The mixture was added by syringe, to an addition burette connected to the polymerization reactor, through a stainless steel filter (7μ). The burette was pressurized to 5.1 bar under N2, and the catalyst was delivered to the polymerization reactor with a continuous flow of ethylene in the presence of hydrogen (total p =3.9 bar, C2:H2 =8:1) at 70°C for 1h. The results are as follows: Cat (g) Filtered PE (g) Activity a M w M w/M n 0.057 No 23.5 2.7 7560 1.9 0.053 Yes 14.4 1.8 8040 1.8 a 106 g PE/mol Zr×h. 4.1 Polymerization procedure—TIBAL as scavenger A 1.0L Zipperclave™ reactor was heated to 100°C under N2 and kept under a flow of N2 for 30min at that temperature. It was evacuated and refilled five times with N2 at 100°C and then cooled to 25°C under N2 pressure. After venting the reactor, TIBAL (0.814g, 4.1mmol) was delivered to the reactor using a 50.0mL stainless steel sample vessel, flushing the contents with 300mL of dry hexane into the reactor under an over-pressure of N2. The resulting solution was heated to 60°C and then stirred under 7.9bar of ethylene at 1000rpm until the temperature had stabilized at 60°C and the flow of ethylene, as measured by a calibrated mass flow meter, had ceased (typically 30min). A suspension of 0.050–0.100g of the supported catalyst in 20mL hexane in a second sample vessel, was flushed into the reactor, using an additional 30mL of hexane, under 8.6bar of N2. Polymerization was allowed to proceed for 30min, and then the reaction was then quenched with a small volume of iPrOH. The reactor was cooled to 25°C, vented and the polyethylene recovered by filtration, washing with MeOH. Polymer samples were dried in a vacuum oven at −1.0bar at 60°C for 6h prior to analysis. 5 Results and discussion Two types of metallocene complexes were investigated: nBuCp2ZrCl2 and Me3SiCp2ZrCl2. Both of these were converted to the corresponding aluminohydride complexes on treatment with LiAlH4 in ether followed by extraction into toluene and drying. nBuCp2ZrH3AlH2 has not been reported before; it is likely this compound is not discrete but consists of a fluxional mixture of complexes differing in their nuclearity. In the case of Me3SiCp2ZrH3AlH2, this compound is known to exist in the solid state as a mixture of trinuclear Zr2Al and tetranuclear Zr3Al complexes [5b]. We suspect a similar formulation applies to nBuCp2ZrH3AlH2 based on the similarity in their low temperature 1H NMR spectra where the exchange process depicted in Eq. (2) is slow on the NMR time scale [6]. (2) Supported catalysts were prepared from two different grades of silica—a broad particle size distribution silica (70–230mesh) provided by Aldrich Chemical Co., equivalent to Davisil™ 635 (ϕ =60Å, 500m2/g, 0.75mL/g), that was fully dehydroxylated at 800°C and a high pore volume, spherical PQ silica (MS-3040, ϕ =310Å, 420m2/g, 3.2mL/g) that was partially dehydroxylated at 600°C. In each case the silica was treated with excess MAO in toluene solution, followed by washing and drying. In the case of PQ silica, significantly more MAO could be impregnated into the pores of this material (14.5wt% Al by atomic absorption analysis) compared with the more commonly available Davisil™ silica (4.4wt%). The supported catalysts were prepared by suspending the alumoxane-impregnated silica supports with a metallocene dichloride or aluminohydride formulation in toluene slurry, followed by filtration and drying. The supported catalysts were analyzed for Zr and Al and the compositions prepared are summarized in Table 1. Fig. 1 compares the morphologies and distribution of Zr as measured by SEM and SEM/EDX, respectively for the two silicas used. It can be observed that the spherical PQ silica has a much more even distribution and higher amount of Zr supported than the irregular Davisil™ silica. Catalysts prepared from Davisil™ silica (DS-SiO2) featured somewhat lower surface Al:Zr ratios at comparable Zr content (e.g. Table 1 entry 6 vs. 13). On the other hand the MAO-treated, PQ silica (PQ-SiO2) absorbed significantly higher amounts of metallocene at the highest loadings investigated (entry 7 vs. 14) but both supports feature equivalent Al:Zr ratios of ca. 16:1. Under these conditions, it can be expected that a significant portion of the supported metallocene is not in its most active state and in the case of the dichloride precursors, alkylation/ionization may even be incomplete [11]. Some of the supported catalysts prepared were characterized by diffuse reflectance FT-IR (DRIFT) spectroscopy. Shown in Fig. 2 is the DRIFT spectra of MAO-treated silica, and the supported nBuCp2ZrH3AlH2 catalyst prepared from it. Characteristic signals due to terminal Al-H, Zr-H and bridging Zr-H-Al stretches are expected in the 1700–1900, 1500–1600 and 1200–1400cm−1 regions, respectively [5d,5h, 12]. In particular, the peak at 1880cm−1 is consistent with terminal Al-H stretching, while that at 1290cm−1 could be due to Zr-H-Al and/or Al-H-Al stretching. A weaker absorption is observed at 1470cm−1 which might be assigned to terminal Zr-H stretching though generally in neutral complexes of this type this absorption is typically found at ν ¯ > 1500 c m − 1 . In support of the first two assignments, in the DRIFT spectrum of a supported catalyst which was exposed to air (red to yellow color change), the two bands at 1880 and 1290cm−1 are noticeably reduced in intensity. For comparison purposes, the solid state FT-IR spectrum (Nujol mull) of nBuCp2ZrH3AlH2 in Fig. 2 exhibits terminal Al-H, and Zr-H stretching at 1820 and 1560cm−1 and bridging Zr-H-Al stretching at 1330cm−1 respectively. That the 1820cm−1 absorbance shifts markedly on contact with MAO silica and the 1560cm−1 absorption is absent 1 1 An absorption at ca. 1640cm−1 of variable intensity appears in all three DRIFT spectra in Fig. 2. Evidently this is not due to a metallocene compound. is not unexpected. In particular, if ionization of these complexes by MAO is at all similar to B(C6F5)3 (Eq. (1)) one would not expect to see signals due to terminal Zr-H stretching in these supported catalysts. Table 1 summarizes the polymerizations results. In all experiments where excess MAO was used as an activator (entries 1–12 and 17–24), the soluble or supported catalyst was pre-contacted with 5.0mL of a 7.0wt% (w:v) solution of MAO in toluene for 5–10min prior to injection of the mixture into the autoclave reactor. Since this procedure can cause leaching of the supported catalyst from the support [13], particularly any unactivated, or neutral metallocene complex present, the results summarized in Table 1 must be discussed with this knowledge in mind. Further, in these cases, an additional amount of MMAO was present in the iso-octane solution and this will also exacerbate leaching, particularly at elevated T. A control experiment featuring pre-contacting a supported nBuCp2ZrH3AlH2 catalyst (Zr=1.39wt%) with MAO (total Al:Zr=1000:1) followed by filtration through a 7μ frit into the reactor under these conditions, revealed that about 2/3 of the observed activity can be accounted for by leaching during this pre-contacting period. As might be expected, the MW and MWD of the PE formed in both cases (filtered vs. unfiltered) was essentially identical (see Section 2). Most polymerization experiments were conducted without prior knowledge as to the actual amount of Zr on the support and therefore many experiments with the supported catalysts feature large and variable Al:Zr ratios as a fixed quantity of MAO (vide supra) and supported catalyst (generally 0.02–0.06g) was used. On the other hand when Al:Zr ratios were varied between 400:1 and 5500:1 using a TMSCp2ZrH3AlH2 supported catalyst of known (and identical) composition, the activities observed were largely independent of this ratio (entries 22–24). Entries 5–7 demonstrate the effect of increasing the amount of Zr on the support. Though activity based on Zr declines as the amount of Zr is increased, the actual yield of polymer increases dramatically and to the point where isothermal conditions could not be maintained at the highest catalyst loading (entry 7). For this reason, subsequent experiments were conducted with this catalyst but it was first diluted by mixing with additional SiO2-MAO using magnetic stirring. This undoubtedly destroys any particle morphology initially present and may increase surface area but the net result of this treatment was enhanced activity (ca. 4–5×higher) at comparable Zr loadings (compare entry 5 vs. 8). Entries 8–12 compare the performance of this aluminohydride catalyst vs. the dichloride catalyst prepared with similar compositions and in the same manner. Polymerization activity based on Zr is anywhere from 25 to 35% higher using the aluminohydride catalysts. Very little difference in MW is observed as a function of supported catalyst used at 75°C (entries 11–12). This is similar to what is observed in solution using these two different catalyst precursors (entries 3–4 – see also ref. [6]). At lower T, a distinct difference in MW is seen (entries 1–2) and this is mirrored to some extent using a supported catalyst though there is significant variation in the results (entries 8 vs. 9 and 8, 9 vs. 10). Entries 13–16 compare the two different catalyst precursors at two different Zr loadings using the higher pore volume PQ silica. Here MAO was not used to (pre)activate these catalysts and TIBAL was used as a scavenger - catalyst leaching is less problematic and one is now comparing intrinsic activities. As one might expect, those catalysts which feature lower Zr loadings have much higher activities (based on Zr) since more of the catalyst precursor is activated on the support. In fact the relationship between catalyst activity and surface Al:Zr ratio is linear and independent of the nature of the catalyst precursor (Fig. 3 ). Under these conditions there were limited if any differences between polymer MW vs. catalyst precursor; the narrower MWD reported reflect the fact that a 3-angle light-scattering detector was used for these GPC analyses (see Section 2). Entries 17–20 examine the effect of changing the surface Al:Zr ratio using PQ-silica supported nBuCp2ZrH3AlH2 but featuring MAO activation. As one might expect, there is no effect of surface Al:Zr ratio seen here on either catalyst activity or polymer MW since much of the observed polymerization activity probably results from catalyst leaching during or subsequent to the activation period. Finally, entries 21 and 22–24 compare the performance of soluble and supported TMSCp2ZrH3AlH2 catalysts on activation with MAO. The supported catalyst is much less active than the soluble version though the MW of the polymer formed is significantly higher than that obtained with the homogeneous catalyst and sensitive to the Al:Zr ratio. It could be that this more sterically hindered, catalyst precursor is less sensitive to leaching by additional MAO. We do note that another sample of this supported catalyst, which featured a lower catalyst loading, had much higher activity (Zr=1.59wt%, A =6.6×106 g PE/mol Zr×h at 3.9bar, 50°C) so catalyst activation may also be influenced here. 6 Conclusions This work has demonstrated that aluminohydride complexes of zirconocenes can be supported on MAO-treated silica and that these supported catalysts can exhibit superior activity compared with their dichloride analogues when activated by additional MAO. Spectroscopic data provide evidence that these polynuclear complexes are deposited intact on MAO-modified silica. It is likely that the improved activity of the aluminohydride catalysts is due to enhanced leaching of the polynuclear catalyst from the support by MAO since polymerization reactions with these same catalysts in the presence of TIBAL do not show similar behavior. Our studies highlight the key role of surface Al:Zr ratios in affecting supported catalyst performance in the absence of significant catalyst leaching.

        "dc:description": "Ethylene polymerization using catalysts derived from activation of zirconocene aluminohydride complexes, supported on silica, pretreated with methylaluminoxane (MAO), is described. The novel catalyst compositions were compared to those using conventional zirconocene dichloride complexes and characterized by SEM/EDX and DRIFT spectroscopy. Supported catalysts were prepared which featured various surface Al:Zr ratios. When using excess MAO as both activator and scavenger, the catalysts containing the most Zr per g of support gave rise to the most active formulations; the high activities in the presence of excess MAO are due, in part, to catalyst leaching prior to and/or during polymerization. When tri-isobutylaluminum (TIBAL) was used as scavenger, the supported catalysts that featured a higher surface Al:Zr ratio had higher activity than those prepared at the lower Al:Zr ratios. The activity of the aluminohydride complexes was significantly higher than that of the corresponding dichloride complexes, when activated by MAO while the in the presence of TIBAL, there was little difference in performance between the two catalyst precursors.",
