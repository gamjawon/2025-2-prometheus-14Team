THORN-CSANYI and M. KESSLER Institut fur Technische und Makromolekulare Chemie, Universitdt Hamburg, Bundesstr. 45, D - 2000 Hamburg 13 (F.R.G.) Summary In continuation of our work on reactions taking place in the conven- tional metathesis catalyst system 'tungsten hexachloride/tetramethyltin' in the presence of substrate, the reaction between tungsten hexachloride and cycloolefin(s) was studied by UV-Vis spectroscopy and gas chromatography. Taking cyclopentene or 2-norbornene as an example, the spectrum of products and the kinetics of the reaction were determined. Furthermore, the question of formation of a complex between tungsten hexachloride and cyclopentene was examined. Introduction Analysis of the reaction steps occuring in the catalyst system 'tungsten hexachloride/tetramethyltin' enabled us to establish a pattern for the entire reaction (Scheme 1) [1]. *01e(in ^ -Me/ICzHe) _ s^ /'\" present s, <of Elher-' --MeCl WC 15 in CeH^ -MeCl WCI, ftl. A Me Me 2ClxW=CH2 -C;^ Scheme 1. WCI^Me In order to determine the course of the various reactions quantitatively (or at least the course of the primary reactions), the next step was the establish- ment of the kinetics of the elementary reactions. 0304-6102/86/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 32 Kinetic studies of the alkylation reaction in toluene showed [2]: (1) The first alkylation step proceeds as a second-order reaction with the low activation energy of 26.1 kJ moF1. (2) The rates of the consecutive reactions of tetramethyltin are much slower than that of the first alkylation step. In common metathesis reactions, the mixing of both catalyst compo- nents takes place in the presence of the olefin. For this reason it is necessary not only to investigate the alkylation reaction, but also to describe exactly the kinetics of the reaction between the tungsten component and the olefin. This paper deals with the study of the reaction between tungsten hexa- chloride and cyclic olefin(s). Determination of the products resulting from the reaction between tungsten hexachloride and cyclopentene Our UV-Vis spectroscopic examinations show that tungsten hexa- chlonde reacts with cyclic as well with acyclic olefins to give tungsten pentachlonde, which is formed as a stable intermediate compound [2]; as proof, tungsten pentachlonde was converted into its etherate (fig. 1) [3]. Investigations on the formation of tungsten pentachloride monoetherate and its characterization by UV spectroscopy have been carried out by Lower [4]. 300 400 500 600 700 Mnm] Fig 1. UV-Vis spectra of tungsten hexachloride I, tungsten pentachlonde II and tungsten pentachlonde monoetherate III in toluene, c^yci = 1.19 mmol I\"1, Ccyciopentene = 238.6 mmol 1~1, Cdiethyl ether =24 mmol 1~1, d = 0.06 cm. 33 There is controversy in the literature concerning the reaction products of cycloolefins. 3-Monochlorocyclopentene was found with cyclopentene as a substrate [5, 6], while on the other hand the formation of 2-chloronorbor- nane and 2, 3-dichloronorbomane was observed [7]. To clarify this subject, tungsten hexachlonde at a concentration of 4.5 X lO\"2 mol 1~1 was reacted with a fifty-fold molar excess of cyclopentene using toluene as the solvent. To eliminate undesired consecutive reactions, care had to be taken not to quench the reaction by water or similar reagents. Our research indicated that decomposition of tungsten chlorides with water in the presence of cyclopen- tene leads to the formation of monochlorocyclopentane. For this reason, the liquid phase was condensed carefully and concentrated afterwards. As ana- lysed by gas chromatography, 1, 2-dichlorocyclopentane is the reaction product. It was identified by GC-MS and by comparing its retention time with the synthesized 1, 2-dichlorocyclopentane. In this context, it should be mentioned that verification of the results by comparing retention times is quite necessary, since the chloro derivates easily eliminate hydrogen chlo- ride, so that the method of mass spectrometry may lead to wrong conclu- sions [3]. A small and not reproducible amount of monochlorocyclopentane was also detected. It could be shown that this is a result of impurities and not a product of the reaction. Is there formation of a 1:1 complex between tungsten hexachloride and cyclopentene^ Literature refers [8] to the fact that a 1:1 complex is formed before the reaction between tungsten hexachloride and cyclopentene takes place. A change in the tungsten hexachloride UV-Vis spectrum was observed in the region between 450 - 700 nm. Our kinetic investigation carried out with a high olefin: tungsten ratio showed no evidence of such complex formation [2]. The immediate chlorination of the olefin was always observed. In contrast to the reaction conditions in the reference, we used an olefin/ tungsten ratio about fifty time higher. Therefore our results cannot be eval- uated as conclusive counter-evidence. To obtain a definite clarification, tungsten hexachloride and cyclo- pentene were then used in stoichiometnc ratio as described in the literature [8]. The investigation was carried out by UV-Vis spectroscopy using toluene as solvent. Figure 2 illustrates the initial spectrum of tungsten hexachlonde and the spectrum obtained 6 mm after cyclopentene was added. The spec- trum from the reference is presented on the right. As the Figure shows, our results give no support for complex formation. Furthermore, it was found that the observed insignificant extinction decrease correlates with the course of the reaction 'tungsten hexachloride-cyclopentene'. A reliable method to detect the presence of a complex is head space chromatography. If complex formation between cyclopentene and tungsten hexachloride takes place, it should be possible to establish a decrease in the 34 Fig 2. Vis spectrum of tungsten hexachlonde in toluene (- -) and the spectrum obtained 6 nun after cyclopentene was added ( ); The spectrum from [8] is in the inset. amount of free cyclopentene. The results obtained offered further evidence against complex formation. Kinetic studies of the reaction between tungsten hexachloride and cycloo- lefin; determination of the reaction order regarding the cycloolefin Kinetic studies of the reaction between tungsten hexachloride and cyclopentene show that the reaction is first order with respect to tungsten hexachloride [2, 3]. An order regarding the cyclopentene could not be deter- mined. The isolation method could not be applied, since it was not possible to raise the concentration of tungsten hexachloride owing to the method of measurement. It was also impracticable to employ the differential method by determination of the initial reaction rates. Low concentrations of cyclo- pentene decreased the reaction rate so much that competitive reactions with impurities became noticeable. UV-Vis spectroscopic investigation of the reaction between tungsten hexachloride and cycloolefin with 2-norbornene instead of cyclopentene as a substrate led to a marked increase in the reaction rate [9]. This fact thus provided a way to study the reaction kinetics using a cycloolefin in stoichio- metric ratios. As detailed UV-Vis spectroscopic measurements showed, it was impossible to determine the reaction kinetics in toluene because of the extremely fast reaction rate. Even using a stoichiometnc amount of 2- norbomene and decreasing the tungsten hexachloride concentration to 10~4 mol 1~1 and the reaction temperature to 70 C did not yield the expected success. A change to the aliphatic solvent heptane to slow the reaction caused many difficulties with the solubility of tungsten(VI)- and especially of tungsten(V)-chlonde. Not only the insufficient solubility but also the instability of tungsten hexachloride in heptane forced us to avoid pure ali- phatic solvents. For this reason, we tried to find a suitable solvent mixture of 35 aliphatic and aromatic compounds to provide the desired qualities: a solubil- ity in toluene and a low reaction rate in heptane. We found optimal reaction conditions in a solvent mixture of heptane/toluene with a 3:1 volume ratio and a reaction temperature of 20 C. The initial concentration of tungsten hexachloride was 8.5 X 10~4 mol 1~1. To determine the reaction order with respect to the 2-norbornene con- centration, the initial rate of reaction was evaluated as a function of the initial concentration of 2-norbornene keeping the initial concentration of tungsten hexachloride constant. As Fig. 3 shows, it was discovered that the reaction is first order with respect to the cycloolefin. At 20 C the rate constant was 3.6 moP1 s~1. The results represented in Fig. 3 were confirmed by the method of integration (Fig. 4).

The 2-norbomene concentration was calculated from its initial amount and the consumption of tungsten hexachloride by means of the reaction equation: The accordance of the values obtained for the rate constant should be noted (Table 1). The divergences which accompany higher conversions (Fig. 4) are due to consecutive reactions; this can be detected by UV spectroscopy. For the determination of the activation energy, rate constants were measured at 273, 253 and 233 K. From the resulting Arrhenius plot of the experimental values (Fig. 5), an activation energy with the low value of 19.2 kJ mol~1 was obtained.

UV-Vis spectroscopic investigation of the consecutive products of the reaction between tungsten hexachloride and cyclopentene The reaction between tungsten hexachloride and cyclopentene was studied kinetically until formation of a stable end product.

The spectra were obtained: 'WC15 after 30 min, I after 13 h, II after 55 h. ments were carried out by means of UV-Vis spectroscopy in the region between 280 and 560 nm using chlorobenzene as a solvent. Figure 6 shows the UV-Vis spectra of the starting compound and of the reaction products. First tungsten pentachloride is formed quantitatively. Then a second intermediate product evolves with two absorption bands at 305 and 465 nm. The end product has a maximum of 308 nm. The spectra of the end product and of the second intermediate product at 305 nm show very little differ- ence in the position of their absorption maxima. Therefore it is not clear whether the absorption band at 305 nm already contains parts of the end product. By addition of alkylating agent, all these products were capable of metathesizing acyclic (as well as cyclic) olefins but with different activities. Tungsten pentachloride is a highly active metathesis catalyst in contrast to the other products, which have much lower activities. This result explains 38 the observation, made by our group [3,10] and as reported in the literature [8, II], that the activity of the catalyst depends on the duration of the reaction between olefin and tungsten hexachloride. Conclusion In conclusion, it can be stated that in common metathesis systems with 2-norbornene as olefin, the alkylating agent tetramethyltin can hardly react before tungsten hexachloride is converted into tungsten pentachloride. In the case of cyclopentene as a substrate, the reaction between tungsten hexa- chloride and cycloolefin enters into competition with the alkylation reac- tion. Furthermore, it should be noted that to obtain a good metathesis catalyst the reaction between olefin and tungsten hexachloride should only lead to tungsten pentachloride. Experimental The investigations were carried out in all-glass vessels with argon puri- fied of traces of oxygen and water as inert gas under the conditions com- monly applied for metathesis reactions [12]. Solvents and olefins used were purified as detailed in [12]. The absolute purity of the tungsten hexa- chloride used was checked by means of its UV spectrum [2]. 2, 3-Dichlorocyclopentane was prepared according to the literature [13]. The kinetic measurements were performed using rotating cuvettes with a Gary 14 spectrophotometer (Applied Physics Corp., Monrovia). GC anal- yses were carried out with a FID gas chromatograph (Fractovap 2307; Carlo Erba) using a 2 m SE 30 and a 2 m VPS column. For the MS investigations we used a mass spectrometer Varian CH7 coupled with a computer (Varian V 73; Varian 620/1 -100). References 1 E. Thorn-Csanyi, Angew. Makromol Chem., 94 (1981) 181. 2 E.
