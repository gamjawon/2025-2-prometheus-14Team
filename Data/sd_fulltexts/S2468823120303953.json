Graphical abstract 5-Acetoxymethylfurfural (AMF) is a promising starting material for synthesis of the valuable furan derivatives. The catalytic properties of Cu-based catalysts obtained from layered double hydroxides were studied in flow hydrogenation of AMF to 5-(acetoxymethyl)-2-furanmethanol (AMFM) in the present work. The resulting product can be easily converted to 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan which has significant potential in the production of polymers and pharmaceuticals. It was found that hydrogenation of AMF gives AMFM with selectivity of 98 % at the full conversion of the substrate under mild reaction conditions (90°C and 10 bar). The influence of the solvent nature, Cu/Al ratio and calcination temperature on the catalyst performance was investigated. Keywords 5-Acetoxymethylfurfural Selective hydrogenation Cu-based catalyst Layered double hydroxide Flow reactor 1 Introduction Upcoming depletion of oil reserves requires the development of new sustainable sources for fuels and bulk chemicals. 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) obtained from the generally available non-edible lignocellulosic biomass is a versatile platform chemical which has a great potential for production of the valuable furan derivatives [1–4]. However, a serious problem for the production, storage and transportation of HMF is its low stability [5–9]. To overcome the problem of chemical fragility of HMF, the conversion of carbohydrates to O-modified HMF derivatives without formation of unstable HMF can be used [6–11]. In this connection, 5-acetoxymethylfurfural (AMF) is an important alternative for HMF [7–10]. Several reports on the production of AMF from carbohydrates without isolating HMF are available [7–9]. For instance, AMF can be obtained by HCl-catalyzed conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to 5-chloromethylfurfural followed by reaction with alkylammonium acetates [7]. Gavilà and Esposito [8] reported a 36 % yield of AMF from cellulose acetate using stoichiometric amount of H2SO4 as the catalyst. Besides, the Sn-montmorillonite catalysts provide direct conversion of glucose, sucrose and fructose into AMF by reaction with acetic acid [9]. The reduction of the formyl group of HMF leads to formation of 2,5-bis-(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF). This compound has a great field of application in the preparation of polymers and pharmaceuticals [3,12,13]. For this reason, significant efforts have been focused on finding suitable heterogeneous catalysts which are able to hydrogenate HMF into BHMF effectively [1–3]. Cu-based materials are the most attractive catalysts for this transformation due to its high selectivity and low cost [14–16]. In particular, copper-doped porous metal oxides prepared by calcination of layered double hydroxide (LDH) [17,18] are capable of catalyzing HMF hydrogenation in BHMF with selectivity higher than 90 % [14]. These materials are considered as promising hydrogenation catalysts due to the uniform distribution of metal ions and the small size of Cu° metal particles obtained after reduction [17–19]. In general, the HMF hydrogenation was carried out in batch reactors [1–3,14–16,20]. Meanwhile, the hydrogenation of furan compounds under flow conditions is of considerable interest [21,22]. Potential advantages of continuous flow synthesis over traditional batch protocols include higher efficiency, environmental compatibility, simplified scaling, and enhanced safety profile [23,24]. In this work, we investigated catalytic properties of Cu-based catalysts obtained from LDHs in flow hydrogenation of AMF to 5-(acetoxymethyl)-2-furanmethanol (AMFM) which can be easily converted to BHMF by hydrolysis [25] (Scheme 1 ). To the best of our knowledge, the data concerning catalytic hydrogenation of AMF are absent in open sources. 2 Experimental part 2.1 Chemicals 5-(Acetoxymethyl)-2-furaldehyde (97 %) from Acros Organics was used without additional purification. Methanol (99.8 %, J.T. Baker), isopropanol (≥99.7 %, Sigma-Aldrich), tetrahydrofuran (THF, ≥99.9 %, Sigma-Aldrich), toluene (99.5 %, “ECOS” Russia), ethanol (95.5 %) and absolute ethanol (0.23 wt% H2O) were employed as solvents. Absolute ethanol was obtained by drying ethanol containing 4.5 wt% of water over freshly prepared CaO and then over calcined molecular sieves (Sigma-Aldrich, 3 Å) with subsequent distillation. THF was distillated using rotary vacuum evaporator before usage. 2.2 Catalyst preparation Cu-Al layered double hydroxides with different Cu:Al molar ratio were prepared by co-precipitation of desired amounts of Cu(NO3)2 and Al(NO3)3 at pH 9.0 ± 0.1 and temperature of 70 °C using NaOH/Na2CO3 solution as described earlier [26,27]. The concentrations of NaOH and Na2CO3 for the precipitant were chosen on the base of data obtained in [28]. The authors showed that using pure sodium carbonate solution (1.0 M) or mixture of NaOH and Na2CO3 with high concentration of Na2CO3 (0.5–1.0 M) as base solution does not allow completely removing sodium ions from LDH material by washing precipitate with distilled water. This is confirmed by our previous work [27]: the sodium content was 5.74 wt% in the Cu-Al LDH material obtained by co-precipitation of metal nitrates by solution containing NaOH and Na2CO3 with concentrations of 0.96 and 0.516 M, respectively. Decreasing sodium carbonate concentration to 0.06 M allows authors [28] to synthesize Cu-Al LDH sample containing only 0.005 wt% of Na while complete substitution of sodium carbonate by sodium hydroxide in the base solution leads to disappearance of sodium ions in LDH material. However in this case the nitrate ions are present in layered structure that affects the phase transformation during calcination. Thus, sodium hydroxide concentration for all samples was 0.96 M ([OH−] = 1.6([Al3+]+[Cu2+])) while the concentration of carbonate ions was 0.86 M which is needed for LDH synthesis according to [18]. The catalysts were obtained by calcination of as-prepared LDHs at 450 °C or 650 °C for 4 h. The list and physico-chemical properties of the catalysts, as well as preparation conditions, are given in Table 1 . 2.3 Characterization techniques The Cu and Al content was determined using atomic absorption spectroscopy on an Optima 4300 DV instrument (Perkin Elmer). The water content in the solvents was measured by DL39 Coulometer KF titrator (Mettler Toledo). Texture properties were derived from low-temperature (−196 °C) nitrogen adsorption isotherms obtained using an ASAP 2400 instrument (Micromeritics). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the samples was carried out in an air atmosphere in the temperature range of 40–700 °C on a Netzsch STA 449 thermogravimeter (Netzsch, Germany) with a heating rate of 10 K min−1 (the sample weight was 50 mg). X-ray patterns were obtained on a Bruker D8 diffractometer (CuKα-radiation, 2θ = 5–70° with step of 0.05°, the accumulation time is 3 s). The multichannel LynxEye detector was used for the signal detection. Phase analysis was done by comparison of interlayer distances di and intensities Ii of corresponding reflexes with theoretical values from ICDD PDF-2 database. The average size of copper crystallites was evaluated by the Rietveld method (LVol-IB, Bruker TOPAS V4.2). TPR measurements were carried out in a quartz reactor using 10 % H2 in Ar at a heating rate of 6 °C/min in the temperature range of 100–600 °C. Before reduction the sample was pretreated at 200 °C for 1.5 h in Ar. The sample mass was about 0.10 g. Thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to determine H2 consumption. 2.4 Catalysts performance The investigation of the catalytic properties was performed using continuous flow device H-Cube Pro™ (Thalesnano) equipped with stainless-steel CatCart®30 reactors (catalyst bed length of 24 mm, inner diameter of 4 mm) [29–32]. Before each catalytic run, the catalyst (0.165 g, 250–500 μm) was reduced with hydrogen dissolved in isopropanol (or another solvent) at T = 120 °C and P = 10 bar for 1 h (flow rates of solvent and H2 were 0.5 and 30 mL/min, respectively) [29,30]. Then the inlet was switched to the flask containing 0.05 M solution of AMF. This moment was chosen as the starting point of the experiment. Catalytic tests were performed at temperature of 50–90 °C, pressure of 10 bar, liquid and hydrogen flow rates of 0.5 and 30 mL min−1, respectively (inlet H2/substrate molar ratio was 54). The performance of catalyst was evaluated by analysis of the samples taken after 30–35 min of the experiment start. The reaction mixtures were analyzed by gas chromatography (Agilent 6890 N Instrument equipped with a capillary HP-1MS column (30 m × 320 μm × 1.00 μm) and an atomic emission detector JAS) using n-decane as the internal standard. The error in determining the conversion and selectivity does not exceed 1 %. Identification of the products was carried out by GC–MS (Agilent 7000B Triple Quad System). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst characterization The thermal behavior of the CuAl-LDH-1 sample was investigated by thermal analysis (Fig. 1 ). The first endothermic step corresponds to removal of physically adsorbed water. The steps in the temperature range of 180–250 °C are attributed to dehydroxylation of brucite-like layers and decarbonization of interlayer carbonate. Additionally, the small exothermic peak at 568 °C is observed on DTA curve. This peak can be related to the strongly bonded carbonates [33]. The authors [34] confirmed this observation for Cu-based catalyst obtained from hydrotalcite-like compound using thermal analysis coupled with mass spectrometer. They showed that there is CO2 formation at temperature around 600 °C. Thus, the calcination temperature of 650 °C was chosen to ensure that no carbonate remained in the sample structure. However, CuAl-LDH-1 was also calcined at 450 °C to investigate the effect of calcination temperature on the catalytic activity. The XRD pattern of the Cu-Al LDHs dried at 110 °C shows the characteristic peaks corresponding to the hydrotalcite phase (not presented) [26,27]. The calcination of the sample at 650 °C results in destruction of the layered structure and formation of copper (II) oxide phase (Fig. 2 ) [26]. There are no reflexes associated with any crystalline form of alumina, probably, due to its amorphous nature. Copper (II) aluminate starts to form at calcination temperatures of ∼750–850 °C [35,36] that is much higher than 650 °C which was used in this study. In situ XRD of the CuAl-1 sample was carried out in hydrogen atmosphere to determine the Cu° particle size after reduction (Fig. 2). According to the obtained results, the reduction of CuO phase occurs in the range of 210–230 °C. The average size of copper crystallites in the reduced sample was 7 nm that is much smaller than in case of the supported Cu/Al2O3 catalysts with high copper content. The similar value of particle size is possible to achieve for the 5% Cu/Al2O3 catalyst [30], but this sample is rapidly deactivated in hydrogenation reactions [29]. The investigation of textural properties showed that an increase in the calcination temperature of CuAl-LDH-1 from 450 to 650 °C promotes decline of specific surface area (SBET ) and pore volume (Vpore ) due to oxides sintering. The CuAl-3 sample with the Cu:Al molar ratio of 2 has the lowest SBET and Vpore which are 47 m2 g−1 and 0.12 cm3 g−1, respectively (Table 1). H2-TPR of the samples with Cu:Al ratio of 1:1 was performed to explore the reduction behavior of copper oxides (Fig. 3 ). A change in the thermal conductivity of the flowing gas (proportional to the hydrogen consumption) during H2-TPR was compared. TPR experiment of the CuAl-1 catalyst calcined at 650 °C shows completely different shape of the reduction profile in comparison to that of the CuAl-2 sample calcined at 450 °C meaning that the residual carbonate species affect the reduction mechanism of copper oxide. The onset and end peak temperatures of the carbonate-containing sample are shifted to the higher temperature values indicating that the presence of carbonate hinders the copper oxide reduction [37]. The reduction of the CuAl-2 sample can be considered as a two-stage process due to the shoulder presence on the TPR curve. The first peak at 253 °C can be related to reduction of CuO phase to Cu2O. The second stage at 312 °C corresponds to the following reduction of Cu2O to Cu°. This assumption correlates with data [34] which show formation of Cu2O in the course of reduction by NEXAFS spectroscopy. The CuAl-1 sample calcined at 650 °C has one TPR maximum at the temperature of 240 °C that corresponds to reduction of CuO to Cu°. 3.2 AMF hydrogenation The catalytic properties of Cu-Al mixed oxides were studied in AMF hydrogenation under continuous-flow conditions in the temperature range of 50–90 °C and hydrogen pressure of 10 bar. Prior to the catalytic test, CuO phase of catalysts was reduced in hydrogen flow at 120 °C to obtain Cu° metal particles [29,30]. It was found that hydrogenation of AMF in the presence of the CuAl-1 catalyst leads to formation of 5-(acetoxymethyl)-2-furanmethanol (AMFM) with selectivity of 98 % at the full conversion of the substrate (Table 2 ). In addition to AMFM, the small amounts of undesired 5-methylfurfural, 5-methylfurfuryl alcohol and acetic acid were observed among the reaction products. Liquid-phase hydrogenation over solid catalysts under continuous flow conditions can be limited by external transfer of reactants to the catalyst surface rather than by reaction kinetics [31,38,39]. Taking this into account, a series of experiments was carried out to study the effect of hydrogen flow rate on the conversion of AMF over the CuAl-1 catalyst by increasing the flow rate of H2 from 5 to 45 mL min−1 at constant liquid velocity, temperature and hydrogen pressure (Fig. 4 ). At hydrogen flow rate from 5 to 30 mL min−1, the AMF conversion increases with increasing gas velocity. In this case, hydrogen mass transfer affects the course of the reaction. However, at higher flow rates of H2 (≥30 mL min−1), the AMF conversion is independent of gas velocity that indicates the absence of external mass transfer limitations under these conditions [31,40]. The apparent activation energy (Ea ) for AMF hydrogenation over the CuAl-1 catalyst (within the temperature range from 50 to 70 °C) estimated from the slope of the Arrhenius plot is about 81 kJ mol−1 (Supplementary Material). This value indicates that the reaction occurs in the kinetic regime [31] and, therefore, subsequent catalytic tests were performed at a H2 flow rate of 30 mL min−1. The solvent effect on AMF hydrogenation over CuAl-1 catalyst was studied. As shown in Table 2, there is no influence of the solvent nature on the AMFM selectivity (Entries 1–6). However, it affects the AMF conversion which decreases in the following order: absolute ethanol ∼ MeOH > i-PrOH > EtOH >> THF > toluene (Table 2, Entries 7–12). The protonic solvents, such as methanol, ethanol and isopropanol, are likely to activate the carbonyl group through the formation of hydrogen bonds promoting the hydrogenation of AMF to AMFM [41]. Thus, excellent yield of AMFM is obtained by AMF hydrogenation in alcohols including ethanol, which are considered as “green” solvent [42]. It should be noted that the reduction of the CuO phase of the catalysts does not occur in a mixture of hydrogen/ethanol due to the presence of a large amount of water (∼4.5 %) that shifts the reaction equilibrium towards copper oxides. Therefore, to carry out the reaction in ethanol, the catalyst must be reduced using a low water alcohol (Table 2, Entries 3 and 9). The CuAl-1 catalyst calcined at 650 °C provides a significantly higher AMF hydrogenation rate than the CuAl-2 sample calcined at 450 °C (Table 2, Entries 7 and 13). It can be explained by incomplete decomposition of carbonate species in the LDH structure at 450 °C that hinders copper oxide reduction as was shown by H2-TPR (Fig. 3). The CuAl-3 sample with the Cu:Al ratio of 2 reveals lower catalytic activity (Table 2, Entries 1, 7, 14 and 15) in comparison to CuAl-1, probably, due to its lower specific surface area (Table 1). The time-dependent study of the CuAl-1 catalyst in AMF hydrogenation showed only a slight decrease in AMF conversion during 2.5 h of experiment, while AMFM selectivity remained unchanged (Fig. 5 ). The study of the spent catalyst by elemental analysis allows to conclude that the leaching of Cu and Al from the catalyst do not occur during the reaction (Supplementary Material). The thermogravimetric analysis under air was performed to estimate the amount of carbonaceous deposits formed on the spent CuAl-1 catalyst (Fig. 6 ). The DSC curve of the spent catalyst showed two endothermic peaks at 107 and 166 °C and one exothermic peak at 247 °C. The peaks at 107 and 166 °C were attributed to desorption of physically adsorbed water and dehydroxylation of the brucite layers, respectively [43]. The exothermic peak at 247 °C can be associated with two oxidation processes. The first process which is characterized by mass loss of 1.2 % is oxidation of carbonaceous deposits which are highly reactive and easily oxidized. The second process is accompanied by mass gain of 0.5 % that corresponds to oxidation of metal Cu particles. Thus, thermogravimetric analysis revealed that the spent catalyst contained approximately 12.1 mg/gcat of carbonaceous species which cause catalyst deactivation [29,32]. The activity of the spent catalyst can be completely restored after oxidative treatment in air at 330 °C (Supplementary Material) [29]. 4 Conclusions The catalytic properties of the Cu-based catalysts prepared by calcination of layered double hydroxides was studied in flow hydrogenation of 5-acetoxymethylfurfural (AMF) to 5-(acetoxymethyl)-2-furanmethanol (AMFM). It was found that the Cu/Al ratio and calcination temperature affect the catalyst performance in AMF hydrogenation. The increase of calcination temperature of Cu-Al layered double hydroxide (Cu/Al of 1) from 450 to 650 °C was shown to enhance significantly conversion of AMF over Cu-based catalyst. It was concluded that incomplete decomposition of the carbonate species in the LDH structure after calcination at 450 °C retards copper species reduction that is a reason of lower activity of the CuAl-2 sample (calcined at 450 °C). Increase of the Cu/Al molar ratio to 2 leads to decrease of AMF conversion, probably, due to low specific surface area and total pore volume. Thus, the best hydrogenation activity is obtained over the CuAl-1 sample with the Cu/Al ratio of 1 prepared by calcination at 650 °C. Flow hydrogenation of AMF over CuAl-1 catalyst gives the AMFM selectivity of 98 % at the full conversion of AMF under mild reaction conditions (90 °C and 10 bar). Solvent nature has no noticeable effect on the AMFM selectivity while AMF conversion decreases in the following order: absolute ethanol ∼ MeOH > i-PrOH > EtOH >> THF > toluene. The use of ethanol as a solvent provides the sustainability of the reaction.

        "dc:description": "5-Acetoxymethylfurfural (AMF) is a promising starting material for synthesis of the valuable furan derivatives. The catalytic properties of Cu-based catalysts obtained from layered double hydroxides were studied in flow hydrogenation of AMF to 5-(acetoxymethyl)-2-furanmethanol (AMFM) in the present work. The resulting product can be easily converted to 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan which has significant potential in the production of polymers and pharmaceuticals. It was found that hydrogenation of AMF gives AMFM with selectivity of 98 % at the full conversion of the substrate under mild reaction conditions (90°C and 10 bar). The influence of the solvent nature, Cu/Al ratio and calcination temperature on the catalyst performance was investigated.",
