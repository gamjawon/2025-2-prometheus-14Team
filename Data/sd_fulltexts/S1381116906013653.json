Keywords Chromium(II) phosphine complexes Chromium catalysts Polymerization 1,2-Polybutadiene Stereoselectivity 1 Introduction 1,2-Polybutadiene is a polymer of industrial interest and industrially produced. It can exist in the amorphous atactic form and in two crystalline forms: isotactic and syndiotactic. At present, the two stereo-isomers that are commercially most used are the syndiotactic and atactic structures [1]. The interest for 1,2-polybutadiene is due to the fact that it is a thermoplastic resin showing the characteristics of both a thermoplastic and an elastomer [1,2]. Because of this peculiarity, it has a wide range of applications. 1,2 syndiotactic polybutadiene is used in films (packaging breathing items for fruits, vegetables and seafood), footwear soles, tubes, and hoses; atactic 1,2-polybutadiene is used in the rubber and tire industry [3]. 1,2-Polybutadiene can be prepared with various catalyst systems [4] based on titanium [5] (e.g. AlEt3/Ti(OR)4), vanadium [6] (e.g. AlEt3/V(acac)3), molybdenum [7] (e.g. AlR3(Mo2(OR)2), cobalt [8] (e.g. Co(acac)3–AlEt3/CS2; (C4H6)Co(η 5-C8H13); CoCl2(PRPh2)2–MAO, R=alkyl or cycloalkyl group), and chromium [9] (e.g. Cr(acac)3–AlEt3, Cr(CNPh)6/AlEt3). The AlEt3–Ti(OR)4 system was the first catalyst used for the preparation of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene, giving, however, a polymer of moderate crystallinity [5]. The AlEt3–V(acac)3 system gave a polymerization product consisting of about 85% 1,2 structure, from which a highly crystalline polymeric fraction having a syndiotactic structure was isolated by successive extractions with different solvents [6]. Catalysts based on molybdenum were characterized by a high stereospecificity, being the syndiotactic crystalline fraction (residue after extraction) about 80% [7]. All these systems based on Ti, V, and Mo were, however, characterized by a rather low activity and did not find an industrial application. 1,2-Syndiotactic polybutadiene is instead industrially produced with cobalt systems which exhibit without any doubt the highest activity and stereospecificity. The system AlR3–Co(acac)3–CS2, for instance, is by far the most active and stereospecific catalyst for the preparation of 1,2-syndiotactic polybutadiene [8c–f]. Chromium catalysts, as cited above, were also used for the preparation of 1,2-syndiotactic polybutadiene. They were found to exhibit a very low activity [9] but, unlike the other systems based on Ti, V, Mo and Co, they were also able to give a 1,2-isotactic polymer from butadiene, and up to now 1,2-isotactic polybutadiene has been obtained only with chromium catalysts. It has been recently reported, however, that more active and stereospecific chromium catalysts for the 1,2 polymerization of 1,3-butadiene can be prepared by using catalysts based on chromium(II) bidentate-phosphine complexes (e.g. CrCl2(dmpe)2–MAO; dmpe=1,2-bis(dimethylphosphino)ethane) [10]. Bidentate phosphine ligands are well known in the field of homogeneous catalysis; in many homogeneous catalytic processes using transition metal complexes with bidentate phosphines as catalysts, the catalyst activity and stereoselectivity were found to be strongly dependent on the type of phosphorous ligand [11]. Many ligand parameters have been proposed in order to evaluate the relationship between ligand properties and catalytic performance; in particular in the case of bidentate phosphines the bite angle was used, which was reported to have both steric and electronic effect [11]. Taking into account what above reported, we have synthesized several new chromium(II) complexes by reacting CrCl2(thf) with the following bidentate aromatic phosphines: bis(diphenylphosphino)methane (dppm), 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane (dppe), 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane (dppp) and bis(diphenylphosphino)amine (dppa). The behavior of these complexes, in association with MAO, in the polymerization of butadiene was examined and compared with that of other similar chromium systems previously reported [10]. They were found to give predominantly 1,2-polybutadienes having different type and degree of stereoregularity depending on the type of phosphine ligand bonded to the chromium atom. The catalytic activity too varied depending on the type of ligand, being for some complexes much higher with respect to the other chromium catalysts recently reported [10]. In the present paper we report on the synthesis of the various chromium complexes, on their use in combination with MAO in the polymerization of butadiene and on the characterization of the polymers obtained; the influence of the ligand on catalyst activity and stereoselectivity is also discussed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and methods Bis(diphenylphosphino)methane (dppm) (Strem, 97% pure), 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane (dppe) (Strem, 99% pure), 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane (dppp) (Strem, 98% pure), bis(diphenylphosphino)amine (dppa) (Strem, 98% pure) and methylaluminoxane (MAO) (Crompton, 10wt.% solution in toluene) were used as received. Toluene (Fluka, >99.5% pure) was refluxed over Na for ca. 8h, then distilled and stored over molecular sieves under dry nitrogen; pentane (Prolabo, >99% pure) was refluxed over Na/K alloy for ca. 8h, then distilled over molecular sieves under dry dinitrogen; diethylether(Lab-Scan, >99.8% pure) was refluxed over Na/K/benzophenone for ca. 8h, then distilled; tetrahydrofurane (Baker, >99.8% pure) was refluxed over K/benzophenone for ca. 8h, then distilled; dichloromethane (Aldrich, 99.8% pure) was degassed under vacuum and then dried over molecular sieves. 1,3-Butadiene (Air Liquide, >99.5% pure) was evaporated from the container prior to each run, dried by passing through a column packed with molecular sieves and condensed into the reactor which had been precooled to −20°C. CrCl2 (thf) [12] was prepared as reported in the literature, by reacting CrCl3 with chromium powder in tetrahydrofurane; the bidentate phosphine chromium (II) complexes were prepared as reported below, following experimental procedures already reported in the literature for analogous complexes [10b,13]. The elemental analyses of the chromium complexes were performed by the analytical laboratories of Polimeri Europa-Centro Ricerche Novara-“Istituto Guido Donegani”; infrared spectra were recorded as KBr disks with a Bruker IFS 48 instrument. 2.2 Synthesis of CrCl2 (dppm) CrCl2(thf) (0.75g, 3.8mmol) and diethylether (25ml) were introduced in a 100ml schlenck tube. The suspension so obtained was kept under stirring at room temperature, then bis(diphenylphospino)methane (1.36g, 3.5mmol) was added. A green-blue precipitate was slowly formed; the suspension was kept under stirring at room temperature for 24h, then filtered. The residue on the filter was dried under vacuum, transferred in a Soxhlet apparatus and then successively extracted in continuous for 24h with boiling pentane in order to remove unreacted diphosphine and then with boiling dichloromethane for 24h. The green dichloromethane solution was then concentrated and an excess of pentane was added. The green precipitate formed was filtered off and dried under vacuum. Yield: 0.87g (45.1% based on CrCl2).

The suspension so obtained was kept under stirring for about 24h, after which the formation of a turquoise precipitate was observed. The solvent was removed under vacuum and the residue was extracted in continuous with boiling pentane for 24h in order to separate unreacted phosphine. The residue on the filter was then extracted in continuous with boiling diethylether for ca. 72h. The diethylether solution was then concentrated and the blue precipitate was separated by filtration and dried under vacuum. Yield: 0.264g (30% based on CrCl2). Anal. Calcd.

A green suspension was rapidly formed; it was kept under stirring for one night, and then filtered. The residue on the filter was dried under vacuum, transferred in a Soxhlet, and extracted first with pentane for about 24h in order to remove the excess of phosphine and then with dichloromethane for about 48h. A green solution was formed which was concentrated under vacuum. A large amount of pentane was then added causing the formation of a green precipitate which was filtered off and dried in vacuum. Yield: 1.57g (66.7% based on CrCl2). Anal. Calcd. For C24H21CrNCl2P2: Cr, 10.23; Cl, 13.95; P, 12.19. Found: Cr, 10.1; Cl, 13.4; P, 11.9. Spectroscopic data: IR (KBr) ν (cm−1) 3054 (ms), 2934 (m), 1484 (m), 1437 (s), 1403 (mw), 1313 (w), 1245 (w), 1157 (s), 1121 (s), 1100 (s), 1072 (ms), 1028 (m), 998 (m), 972 (mw), 829 (mw), 744 (s), 721 (s), 695 (s), 551 (s), 510 (s). 2.5 Synthesis of CrCl2 (dppa) CrCl2(thf) (2.58g, 13.2mmol) was suspended in diethylether (70ml). Bis(diphenylphosphino)amine (5g, 13mmol) was then added and the reaction was kept under stirring at room temperature for ca. 24h. The formation of a light green precipitate was observed while the supernatant solution was green. The green precipitate was separated by filtration, dried under vacuum, transferred in a Soxhlet and then extracted in continuous with boiling pentane for 48h; in this way the unreacted phosphine could be separated in the pentane solution. The residue was then extracted in continuous with boiling dichlorometane for 48h; at the end the dark green solution thus obtained was concentrated, a large amount of pentane was added causing the formation of a green precipitate which was separated by filtration and then dried under vacuum. Yield: 2.372g (35.4% based on CrCl2). Anal. Calcd. For C24H21CrNCl2P2: Cr, 10.23; Cl, 13.95; P, 12.19. Found: Cr, 10.4; Cl, 14.2; P, 12.3. Spectroscopic data: IR (KBr) ν (cm−1) 3227 (mw), 3148 (mw), 3053 (m), 1483 (m), 1436 (s), 1410 (w), 1184 (ms), 1126 (s), 1099 (s), 1026 (m), 999 (m), 944 (m), 741 (s), 693 (s), 618 (w), 592 (w), 540 (s), 515 (s). 2.6 Polymerization of butadiene All operations were carried out under an atmosphere of dry dinitrogen. A standard procedure is reported. 1,3-Butadiene was condensed into a 25mL dried glass reactor kept at −20°C, then toluene was added and the solution so obtained was brought to the desired polymerization temperature. Methylaluminoxane (MAO) and the chromium compound were then added, as toluene solutions, in the order. The polymerization was terminated with methanol containing a small amount of hydrochloric acid; the polymer was coagulated and repeatedly washed with methanol, then dried in vacuum at room temperature. 2.7 Polymer characterization The infrared spectra were performed with a Bruker IFS 48 instrument, using polymer films on KBr disks. The films were obtained by deposition from solutions in benzene or hot (ca. 100°C) solutions in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene. 13C NMR measurements were performed with a Bruker AM 270 instrument. The spectra were obtained in C2D2Cl4 at 103°C (hexamethyldisiloxane, HMDS, as internal standard). The concentration of polymer solutions was about 10wt.%. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) scans were carried out on a Perkin Elmer Pyris 1 instrument. Typically, ca. 10mg of polymer were analyzed in each run, while scan speed was ca. 20K/min under a dinitrogen atmosphere. The molecular weight averages (MW) and the molecular weight distribution (MWD) were obtained by a high temperature GPCV 2000 system (from Waters) using two on-line detectors: a differential viscometer and a refractometer. The experimental conditions consisted of three Olefi columns from PSS, o-dichlorobenzene as mobile phase, 0.8mL/min of flow rate and 145°C of temperature. The calibration of the GPC system was constructed by 18 narrow MWD polystyrene standards with the molar mass ranging from 162 to 3.3×106 g/mol. The polybutadiene microstructure was determined according to what already reported in the literature [8e,14]. 3 Results and discussion The chromium complexes were prepared according to a general experimental procedure already reported in the literature [10b,12,13]. CrCl2(thf) was reacted with the various bidentate phosphines using diethylether as solvent. A suspension is always formed; the precipitate was separated by filtration and then worked up as described in the experimental part. The complexes were found to have, by elemental analysis, the general formula CrCl2(L) (L=dppm, dppe, dppp, dppa). The results obtained in the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene with the systems obtained by combining the above complexes with MAO are reported in Table 1 and can be summarized as follows: (i) The systems CrCl2(Ph2P(CH2)nPPh2)–MAO (n =1, 2, 3) give from butadiene polymers having an essentially 1,2 structure. The 1,2 content varies in the range 80–90%, slightly increasing with decreasing the length of the bridge (n) between the two phosphorous atoms. The type of ligand has, however, a much stronger influence on catalyst stereoselectivity. As a matter of fact, CrCl2(dppm)–MAO gives 1,2-polybutadienes in which isotactic sequences are predominant (see Fig. 1c), while CrCl2(dppe)–MAO and CrCl2(dppp)–MAO give essentially syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadienes (see Fig. 1b). The catalyst activity too, is greatly affected by the type of ligand, being the system CrCl2(dppm)–MAO much more active than the other systems CrCl2(dppe)–MAO and CrCl2(dppp)–MAO (see Table 1). (ii) As reported by van Leeuwen [11], the effect of bite angle (β n ) in catalytic reactions can be separated in steric bite angle effect and electronic bite angle effect. The first one is related to the steric interactions (ligand–ligand or ligand–substrate) generated when the bite angle is modified by changing the backbone and keeping the substituents at the phosphorous donor atom the same. This likely means that, at least in the series CrCl2(Ph2P(CH2) n PPh2)–MAO (n =1, 2, 3), the effect of the ligand on activity, chemoselectivity and stereoselectivity would be mainly due to steric factors; an increased hindrance of the ligand, from dppm to dppe and dppp, seems indeed to cause a decreasing in catalyst activity (the coordination of the monomer is likely more difficult when a hindered ligand is bonded to the metal) and a radical change in stereoselectivity, from isotactic to syndiotactic. The fact that CrCl2(dppm)–MAO gives 1,2-polybutadienes in which isotactic sequences are predominant, while CrCl2(dppe)–MAO and CrCl2(dppp)–MAO give predominantly syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadienes, can be interpreted according to the previously suggested diene polymerization mechanism [15]. The interpretation already given for the results obtained in the polymerization of butadiene with the two systems CrCl2(dmpm)2–MAO [10b] and CrCl2(dmpe)2–MAO [10a] and with the cobalt systems CoCl2(PRPh2)2–MAO (R=methyl, ethyl, normal-propyl, iso-propyl and cyclohexyl) [8i] is still valid and applicable to the chromium systems of this work. The catalytic site in the polymerization of butadiene with the chromium systems of this work is most probably that shown in Fig. 2 . The incoming monomer and the butadienyl unit can assume two different orientations (exo–exo and exo–endo). By insertion of the incoming monomer at C3 of the butadienyl group a 1,2 polymer is obtained in both cases, isotactic from an exo–endo situation (Fig. 2-right), syndiotactic from an exo–exo situation (Fig. 2-left). An orientation like that in Fig. 2-right is favored when no ligand or a low hindered ligand (low β n value) is bonded to the metal while an orientation like that in Fig. 2-left is the favored one when an hindered ligand (higher β n value) is present. This is the reason why predominantly isotactic polymers when L=dppm (β n =72°) and essentially syndiotactic polymers when L=dppe or dppp (β n =85° and 91°, respectively) are obtained. (iii) We have also investigated the effect of Al/Cr molar ratio value on catalyst activity and selectivity. It was found to have practically no influence on catalyst chemo- and stereoselectivity, while catalyst activity was found to increase with increasing the Al/Cr molar ratio. A larger number of active sites is likely formed at higher Al/Cr ratio. (iv) We have also examined the polymerization of butadiene with CrCl2(dppa)–MAO. This system gave highly syndiotactic 1,2 polymer (percentage of syndiotactic triads, [rr], of about 65%) and exhibited a very high activity. If we compare this system with other syndiospecific chromium catalysts previously reported (e.g. CrCl2(dmpe)2–MAO) [10], we observe that the system CrCl2(dppa) is less stereospecific (percentage of syndiotactic triads [rr] of 65% versus 85% for CrCl2(dmpe)2–MAO) but largely more active (N =moles of butadiene polymerized per mol of Cr per hour=11667h−1 versus 1024h−1 for CrCl2(dmpe)2–MAO). The presence of a potential donor nitrogen atom in the backbone determining weak interactions with the metal center and, as reported by van Leeuwen [11a], leading to an enlargement of the bite angle, could in some way account for the high activity and syndiospecificity of the system CrCl2(dppa)–MAO. (v) The influence of the polymerization temperature on selectivity was also evaluated and, as already reported for other chromium systems [10], the polymer syndiotacticity was found to increase with decreasing the polymerization temperature. The system CrCl2(dppa)–MAO gives a 1,2-polybutadiene with a melting point of 137°C and a syndiotactic index [rr] of about 73% at −30°C (Table 1, run 13), while the polymer obtained at room temperature has a melting point of 104°C and a syndiotactic index of 66% (Table 1, run 9). 4 Conclusions A new class of chromium catalysts, CrCl2(Ph2P–X–PPh2)–MAO [X=(CH2), (CH2)2, (CH2)3, NH] have been prepared and used in the polymerization of butadiene to essentially 1,2 polymers. Isotactic or syndiotactic polymers were obtained depending on the type of ligand. A relationship between stereoselectivity and ligand bite angle has been suggested. The systems CrCl2(dppa)–MAO and CrCl2–(dppm)–MAO gave syndiotactic and predominantly isotactic 1,2-polybutadienes, respectively, and exhibited an activity much higher with respect to the other syndiospecific and isospecific chromium systems up to now known. Moreover, these catalysts appear of interest from the industrial point of view, since their activities and stereospecificities are comparable with those of the cobalt catalysts actually used for the industrial production of 1,2-polybutadiene.
