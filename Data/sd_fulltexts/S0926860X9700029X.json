Blasco, J.M. L6pez Nieto* lnstituto de Tecnologfa Qu[mica, UPV-CSIC, Avenida de los Naranjos s/n, 46071 Valencia, Spain Abstract This paper summarizes the main data appeared in the last years on the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of short chain alkanes on supported vanadium oxide catalysts. The acid-base character of metal oxide support influences the dispersion of vanadium on the surface of the support, as well as the nature of the vanadium species. The reducibility and structure of surface vanadium oxide species and the acid-base character of catalysts, in addition to their catalytic properties in the ODH of Cz-C4 alkanes, strongly depend on the metal oxide used as support and the vanadium loading. In this way, it appears that tetrahedral VS+-species are active and selective sites in the ODH of C2~C4 alkanes. The effect of the coordination number and aggregation state of surface vanadium oxide species, and the presence of acid/base sites on the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide catalysts are discussed. It is concluded that these are important factors that must be considered to develop selective catalysts in ODH reactions.

Introduction One of the driving forces of the refining and petrochemistry industry is the upgrading of cheaper feedstocks. In this line, selective oxidation reactions appear to be an alternative way to functionalize low molecular weight paraffins, in substitution of the more expensive olefins, to obtain oxygenated compounds. This is the case of the selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride on V-P-O catalysts [1-4], which is a clear example of an industrial process in the selective oxidation of paraffins, and, more recently, of the oxidation and ammoxidation of ethane and propane to the corresponding aldehydes, acids or nitriles [4-7]. * Corresponding author.

Nieto /Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 117-142 On the other hand, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions are also an attractive alternative to classical dehydrogenations. In fact, the dehydrogenation of paraffins to give the corresponding olefins and H2 is a strongly endothermic process which has to be carded out at temperatures above 600. At the high reaction temperatures, other unwanted reactions leading to coke also occur, and the catalyst needs frequent regeneration. In oxydehydrogenation reactions, the abstracted hydrogen is oxidized, releasing heat of reaction, and the conversion becomes significant at a much lower reaction temperature. However one of the main points in catalyst optimization is to minimize the consecutive reactions. In this sense, a better understanding of the mechanism of the paraffin activation in the presence of molecular oxygen will be very helpful to develop new selective catalysts. Supported vanadium oxides have been reported to be selective catalysts in a number of catalytic reactions, i.e. the oxidation of methanol, methane and olefins, the oxidation and ammoxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons and the selective catalytic reduction of NOx [8-16]. Recently, they have been shown to be selective catalysts in the ODH reactions [17-21]. The advantages of supported metal oxides include higher mechanical strength, better thermal stability and larger surface area. However, the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide is modified by the nature of the metal oxide support and the vanadium loading. In this way, the selectivity of bulk V205 in the ODH of short chain alkanes [22-26] is enhanced when vanadium oxide is mixed or supported on other metal oxides, increasing the formation rate of the desired olefins. This is the case of vanadium-magnesium mixed oxides (VMgO), that show a high selectivity to olefins in the ODH of n-butane [25,27,28], propane [26,29-31] and ethylben- zene [32]; or V-Mo-Nb-O mixed oxides which are selective catalysts in the ODH of ethane [33,34]. More recently, it has also been shown that V-containing molecular sieves are highly selective for the oxydehydrogenation products during the oxidation of ethane [35,36] and propane [37-39]. However, although several catalytic system have been studied [17-21], the nature of the active and selective sites is not well known yet. The different catalytic properties of bulk and supported vanadia catalysts are usually related to modifications in the coordination and environment of V-species which can modify its redox properties. In order to better establish the influence of the support, a number of papers have been devoted to the study of monolayer systems (monomolecular dispersion in which the oxide is maximally influenced by the support) to optimize the dispersion of the active sites [13-16]. From these studies it can be concluded that both the nature of the vanadium species and the catalytic behavior depend on the metal oxide support. However, in spite of the variety of catalytic system studied, the reaction mechanism and nature of the selective sites for the ODH of short chain alkanes are still under discussion. Since the structure-activity/selectivity correlation could be expected to change with the alkane fed, the aim of the present paper is to summarize the catalytic T. Blasco, J.M.L. Nieto /Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 117-142 119 results obtained during the ODH of short chain alkanes on supported vanadium oxide catalysts, as well as the structure and properties of different catalytic systems, in order to understand the nature of active and selective sites in vanadia catalysts. 1.1. Characteristics of supported vanadium oxide 1.1.1. The dispersion of vanadium oxide Many supports [8-16] have been tested in order to modify the physico-chemical properties of single metal oxide, including: (i) metal oxides such as SiO2, TiO2, ZrO2, A1203 and MgO; (ii) mixed metal oxide, i.e., TiO2/SiO2 [40,41], TiO2/A1203 [42], SIO2/A1203 [43,44], calcined hydrotalcite (Mg-A1-O mixed metal oxides) [45], sepiolite (Mg-Si-O) [46,47], A1NbO4 [48,49] and (iii) other type of materials, i.e. amorphous [50] or microporous aluminophosphates (A1PO4-5) [39,51] and MgF2 [52]. Although supported vanadia catalysts have been characterized by various techniques, i.e. FTIR, XPS, EPR, UV-vis, TPR, etc. [34-37,39,53-70], the major structural information about the nature of surface vanadium oxide species at monolayer and submonolayer covering the single metal oxide supports has been derived from Raman [60-64], solid-state NMR [64-67] and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (EXAFS/XANES) [68-70]. The results reported in the bibliography indicate that the dispersion of the vanadium oxide as well as its structure can be understood on the basis of the different acid-base character of the different supports. The acidity of the metal oxides is related to the pH at which the surface possesses zero surface charge (point of zero charge, pzc). Table 1 reports the isoelectric point or point of zero charge of several metal oxides which have been used as supports or promoters. From the data in Table 1 and other acidity measurements [53-56,71], the acid character of V205 and the metal oxides more frequently used as support decreases as follows: V2Os>SiO2>TiO2=ZrO2>A1203>MgO, while the acidity of mixed metal oxides is intermediate between those of the corresponding single metal oxides [54,56]. It has been observed that the tendency of VOx species to be dispersed on the surface of the metal oxide support is related to its basicity, and decreases from MgO to SiO2 [54,57]. In other words, the agglomeration of vanadium oxide species to form V205 crystallites is favored with the acid character of the support. Moreover, the structure of the vanadium species depends on the acid-base nature of the metal oxide support [40,54]. In this way, while crystalline V2Os-like structures are obtained at relatively low vanadium coverages (10% of the theoretical monolayer) on an acid metal oxide as SiO2 [61], metal vanadates are formed, at relatively high vanadium content and surface coverages of the support, on basic metal oxide supports [57]. These results can be explained by the acid character of the vanadium oxide (see above) that can easily interact and react with basic oxides, whereas a weaker interaction with 120 T. Blasco, J.M.L.

The importance of acid-base character of metal oxide support on the dispersion and the nature of metal anions have also been observed during the preparation of other supported metal oxide catalysts [54,58]. The addition of metal oxide as promoters or the presence of impurities on the support can modify the structure of the surface vanadium oxide species depending on their acid-base properties [40]. In this way, the use of zeta potential studies of catalysts and supports [53,58,59] by electrophoretic migration could help to understand some modifications observed on supported vanadia catalysts. The characteristics of catalysts supported on A1203 and TiO2 are in agreement with their acid character. Thus, if a vanadium oxide monolayer completely covering the surface of the support would need 4.98 1014 molecules V205 cm-2, the appearance of V205 crystallites on A1203 occurs at vanadium loading of about 60% of the theoretical monolayer, while a very thin layer of vanadia can be formed on TiO2-anatase at about the theoretical monolayer coverages [61]. A1- or Ti- vanadates are not generally formed in these systems. On ZrO2-supported vanadia catalysts, a rapid formation of multilayer structures has also been observed as a consequence of the weak interaction between the support and the dispersed T, Blasco, J.M.L. Nieto /Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 117-142 121 vanadium oxide [40,72], although Zr2V207 are formed at vanadium loading exceeding the theoretical monolayer [73]. In order to increase the dispersion of the VOx species and avoid the formation of bulk V205 on more acid metal oxide supports, catalysts with different vanadium contents below the theoretical monolayer have been studied. As can be expected from the previous considerations, the dispersion and nature of the VOx species formed in catalysts with low V contents are also determined by the acidity of the metal oxide used as support. To simplify the description of the different type of tetrahedral V~+ species formed, in some cases we shall use the Q(n) notation, in which n refers to the number of neighboring VO4 tetrahedra linked through O atoms. Characterization studies on VOx/SiO2 catalysts (1-10 wt% [74] have shown the existence of isolated VO4 tetrahedra of the type (SiO)3V=O dispersed on the SiO2 surface in dehydrated catalysts. Under ambient condition, the vanadium coordina- tion changes forming a hydrated surface phase in which the vanadium environment is similar to that of V205 [66,67,74]. This change has been explained by the acidic aqueous environment on hydrated silica on which vanadia species cannot be dispersed [74]. Isolated VO4 tetrahedra are also observed on catalysts supported on A1203, TiO2 or ZrO2, at very low vanadium loading [59-67,70]. With increasing V content, VO4 tetrahedra aggregates forming chains or bidimensional arrays. At higher surface coverages, the V5+ progressively becomes six coordinated in an environment similar to that of metavanadates or decavanadates. Upon dehydration the tetra- hedral coordination is favored together with other species on A1203 and TiO2, and quite complex 51V NMR spectra are obtained [65]. The appearance of V205 crystallites is only observed at vanadium oxide coverages above 60 (A1203) or 100% (TiO2) of the theoretical monolayer [61]. In fact, several studies carried out with Raman [40,58-62] and 51V NMR spectroscopy [64-67,75] indicate that, on both VOx]AI203 and VOx]TiO2 catalysts, the V-environment goes from tetrahedral at low coverages to octahedral at high coverages. On the most basic metal oxide supports, i.e. MgO-supported vanadia catalysts, isolated VO4 tetrahedra without bridging V-O-V oxygen ions (Q(O~ type) forming Mg3V2Os-like structures are observed within a larger range of V content [25-32]. Dimeric VO4 tetrahedra of the Q(1) type (MgzVzO7-1ike), and mixed ortho and pyro Mg vanadates have also been observed depending on the catalysts preparation procedure and/or the V-loading [25-31,67,75]. The V5+ species formed on MgO can be understood on the basis of the strong interaction between the V-atoms and the support leading to highly dispersed vanadium species at low coverages [75], and to the formation of crystalline Mg vanadates when the vanadium content increases. This is also observed on catalysts supported on basic metal oxides as La203, Sm203, Bi203 [57], in which the corresponding metal-vanadate is formed. A vanadium oxide dispersion intermediate between those on MgO and AlaO3 or SiO2 has been observed in catalysts supported on calcined hydrotalcite [45,75] and 122 T. Blasco, J.M.L. Nieto/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 117-142 on sepiolite [46,47,76], since they show an intermediate acid character [56]. Although the characteristics of the VOfitydrotalcite catalyst resemble that of VOx/MgO catalyst, the 51V NMR spectra suggest a higher heterogeneity of vanadium sites and tetrahedral V5+ species with different number of bridging oxygen ions (probably of Q(0~ and Q(~) types) [28,75]. Then, although a Mg3V208- like structure is mainly formed, also species of Q(I~ type like in pyrovanadates seems to be present. On the other hand, mainly dimeric V5+ species are detected on the VOflsepiolite catalyst at low vanadium loading (a- and fl-Mg2V207) [28,46,47], while MgV206 and V205 are observed at high V-loading [47,76]. The presence of Mg-O-A1 and Mg-O-Si pairs, in addition to Mg-O-Mg pairs in calcined hydrotalcite and sepiolite, respectively, modify the interaction of the Mg-sites with the vanadium atoms leading to V5+ species different from those observed on MgO. Since the Mg/Si atomic ratio in sepiolite is lower than the Mg/ A1 atomic ratio in hydrotalcite, the number of Mg-O-Mg sites must be more abundant in the latter. The higher concentration of heterogeneous (Mg-O--Si) pairs in VOflsepiolite favors the formation of V207 units which are minority in VOflHydrotalcite [75]. The results obtained for vanadia supported on mixed metal oxides suggest that it is possible to control the structure and reactivity of the vanadia monolayers by modifying the local structure of the oxide support. This is the case not only of hydrotalcite but also of A1NbO4 [48,49] in which the presence of A13+ sites in a magnesia or niobia matrix, respectively, modifies the aggregation state of vana- dium species and finally its catalytic behavior. In this way, Matralis et al. [42] observed an important influence of the Ti/A1 ratio on the type of vanadium species in vanadia supported on mixed TiO2-A1203 supports. Thus, for a given V-loading, the higher the Al-content (within the range 10-82 wt%) is, the higher are both the catalyst surface area and the dispersion of vanadia. These modifications of the TiO2 support lead to the formation of monomeric vanadyl and polymeric vanadates species in VOx/(TiO2+AI203), while V205 is formed in VOflTiO2 catalysts. 1.1.2. The stability of metal oxide support No significant effects of the preparation method and modifications of the support are usually observed on the structure of the VOx species in supported vanadium oxide catalysts [77] and this is mainly determined by the type of support. However, in some cases, the final surface vanadium concentration depends not only on the vanadium content, but also on possible modifications of the support during the impregnation and/or calcination steps. For this reason, we think that it is interesting to briefly summarize here the possible transformations of the metal oxide supports in processes involved in the catalyst preparation. The structure of TiO2 [78] and ZrO2 [79] can be transformed during the calcination step, and these modifications are generally enhanced in the presence of vanadia. In the case of TiO2 the use of different polymorphs (anatase, rutile, T. Blasco, ZM.L. Nieto/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 117-142 123 brookite, B-phase) is not critical for partial oxidation reactions [80], although Slinkard and De Groot [81] found that the catalysts supported on rutile are more selective for the oxidation of n-butenes to acetic acid and acetaldehyde than those supported on anatase. However, different catalytic behavior during the ODH of propane is observed on catalysts prepared on ZrOe-tetragonal or on ZrO2-mono- clinic [82]. Modifications of the support during the calcination step are also observed in natural sepiolite or Mg-A1 hydrotalcite-like materials used as supports. In the former case, the initial Mg8SileOa(OH)4 crystalline phase is transformed into MgSiO3 in a degree which depends on the vanadium content and the calcination temperature [47,83]. In the latter case, A1203 is highly dispersed on amorphous MgO material [84]. These transformations observed in sepiolite- and hydrotalcite- supported vanadia catalysts, also occur in the absence of vanadium, indicating that the incorporation of vanadium oxide does not stabilize the crystalline structure. The hydrotalcite structure is partially regenerated in both cases if the calcined materials are rehydrated [45,84]. In the case of MgO some modification can occur depending on the preparation procedure [21,85]. MgO is transformed into Mg(OH)e when the impregnation is carried out in the presence of water. In these conditions, vanadium is partially occluded in the bulk of the catalyst after calcination, resulting in a lower surface vanadium concentration, as concluded from the differences between surface and bulk V/Mg atomic ratios [85]. Similar results have also been observed in MoOx/MgO catalysts [86]. Some modification of the support was observed on vanadia supported on microporous AIPO4-5 materials [39] or amorphous aluminophosphates [51]. In VOx/A1PO4-5 catalysts, the formation of amorphous materials (trydimite type) at vanadium loading of 2 wt% of V-atom or higher, not observed at lower vanadium loading or on pure A1PO4-5, indicates that the presence of vanadia favours a crystallinity loss of microporous material. However, the opposite trend is observed on vanadia supported on amorphous aluminophosphates (A1PO's) and a partial crystallization of A1PO-materials is observed at high vanadium concentrations [51]. We must indicate that in some cases, an attractive alternative to the conventional catalyst preparation procedure of supported vanadia catalysts can be the formation of non-stable crystalline phases. This is the case of V-containing hydrotalcite, in which vanadium is initially incorporated to hydrotalcite-structure, but after calcination, dispersed vanadia species are obtained [87,88]. 1.2. ODH of short chain alkanes 1.2.1. On the nature of active and selective sites Bulk vanadium oxide is known to posses a vast reservoir of oxygen which becomes highly mobile when the oxide is in a partially reduced state.

Variation of the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products with the alkane conversion during the ODH of C2--C4 alkanes on unsupported V205 (see [12-17]). this mobile lattice oxygen is capable to achieve selective oxidation, but at the very high temperatures used for paraffins it can cause overoxidation [21]. From the results shown in Fig. 1, it can be seen that a low selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products are obtained during the oxidation of Ca--Ca paraffins on V205 [22-26], being higher during the ODH of propane, specially at low propane conversions [26]. When vanadium oxide is incorporated or mixed with magnesium oxide, an active and selective catalytic system in the ODH of n-butane [25,27,28] and propane [26- 31] is obtained. Mg vanadates, i.e. Mg3V208 and/or Mg2V/O7, are observed in the most effective catalysts suggesting that these are the active phases in the ODH of n- butane. However, lower activity and selectivity has been obtained with pure Mg vanadates and therefore, the nature of active and selective sites is not well know yet. Corma et al. [57] studied the catalytic properties of supported vanadium oxide catalysts in the ODH of propane (Table 2). The most selective catalysts were obtained when vanadia was supported on basic metal oxide supports, i.e. MgO, Bi203, La203 and Sm203, while worse catalytic properties were observed for those supported on acid metal oxides (SiO2, TiO2, A1203), suggesting a parallelism between the appearance of Me vanadates (and the absence of V205) and the selectivity to olefins. Then, it was concluded that the use of basic metal oxides induced the formation of tetrahedral V5+ species which could be considered as the selective sites in the ODH of alkanes. T. Blasco, J,M.L.

Comparison of the most effective supported vanadium oxide catalysts in the ODH of propane (Table 3), shows that, except in the case of VOSFiO2 catalysts which will be commented later, a higher selectivity is obtained at vanadium loading below that of the theoretical monolayer. In addition, for most of these catalysts, tetrahedral V5+ species are proposed to be the selective sites in the ODH reactions, as they are the main species present at submonolayer coverages. 126 T.

Experimental conditions: Temperature=500; alkane conversion of 20% and an alkane/oxygen/helium molar ratio of 4/8/88 (propane) and 5/20/75 (n-butane). Although the vanadium loading influences the catalytic behavior of supported catalysts, this influence also depends on the alkane fed. Fig. 2 shows the variation of the selectivity to olefins during the ODH of propane and n-butane with the catalyst vanadium content of MgO- and sepiolite-supported vanadia catalysts [76]. No substantial differences in the evolution of the selectivity with the V- loading are observed for propane and n-butane on MgO-supported vanadia catalysts (Fig. 2(A)). However, a more marked decay in the selectivity to olefins with the V content is observed during the ODH of n-butane on sepiolite-supported vanadia catalysts (Fig. 2(B)). In order to explain the different behavior of the VOJ MgO and VO~/sepiolite catalysts, we must consider the structure of the vanadium species on both catalytic systems. As has been commented previously, although tetrahedral vS+-species are present in both MgO and sepiolite supports, a higher degree of aggregation of the VO4 units occurs in the VO~/sepiolite. Thus, while V207 units in a Mg2V207 structure are already formed at low V-contents on T.

Experimental conditions: temperature of 500; n- butane/oxygen/helium molar ratio of 5/20/75; and a n-butane conversion of 20%. sepiolite, mainly isolated VO4 tetrahedra in a Mg3V208-1ike structure is observed on MgO. Therefore, the catalytic results shown in Fig. 2 suggest that depending on the size of the reactant, the distance between the selective sites can influence the selectivity in the ODH reactions, as has been proposed by Michalakos et al. [94]. In this way, as n-butane is larger than propane, it can react with two adjacent VO4 units (VO3-O-VO3) simultaneously on sepiolite supported catalyst, producing a deeper oxidation than when the reaction is carried out on isolated VO4 units (as in MgO supported catalysts). In order to explain the importance of the V-loading and thus of the VOx species on the selectivity to ODH reactions, Fig. 3 shows the variation of the selectivity to C4-olefins with the vanadium loading during the ODH of n-butane on supported vanadium oxide catalysts, using several metal oxide support: MgO, Mg-A1 hydrotalcite, sepiolite and A1203 [28,45,46,87]. Small differences in the selectivity to C4-olefins is observed on VOx/MgO catalysts. However, on the other catalytic systems, the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products strongly depends on the vanadium loading, and a maximum selectivity to C4-olefins at vanadium loadings of 30, 10 and 7 wt% V205 are observed on catalysts supported on hydrotalcite, sepiolite and A1203, respectively. While isolated and/or dimeric tetrahedral V5+- species are formed on MgO- and Hydrotalcite-supported catalysts in all the V- range studied, octahedral VS+-species are observed on sepiolite- and alumina- supported catalysts at V-loading higher than 10 and 7 wt% V205, respectively. 128 T. Blasco, J.M.L Nieto/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 117-142 These results suggest that besides the aggregation state of V5+ species also the coordination number affect the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium catalysts. However, if we only consider the coordination of vS+-species and/or the distance between two active sites as responsible of the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide catalysts, it is very difficult to explain the different catalytic behavior of both SIO2- and A1203-supported vanadia catalysts during the ODH of n-butane and ethane. In fact, from the study of VOx/A1203 [95,96] or VOJ SiO2 [97] in the ODH of ethane, the highest selectivities to oxydehydrogenation products are obtained on catalysts with vanadium loading of 7 and 1 wt% V205, respectively. Although they show a good selectivity in the ODH of propane (i.e. on VOx/A1203 [93] or on VOJSiO2 [89]), a poor selectivity to C4-olefins during the ODH of n-butane is obtained on both VOx/A1203 [96,98] and VOx/SiO2 [14,15,99]. Isolated tetrahedral VS+-species of the (SiO)3V=O type has been proposed as selective sites in VOJSiO2 catalysts [14,15], while both isolated and polymeric tetrahedral V5+ species are mainly present on selective VOJA1203 catalysts [19,96]. Thus, the catalytic behavior of these catalysts must be influenced by physico-chemical properties other than the aggregation state of the VO4 units. One of the most important properties to be considered is the reducibility of the catalyst, as it can affect its catalytic behavior. In fact, it has been suggested that, in the case of metal vanadates, the catalyst reducibility determines the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation reaction in the sense that the more reducible the less selective the catalysts is [100]. However, no correlation between catalyst reducibility (considering the Tonset in TPR experimentsFig. 4A) and selectivity to olefins in the ODH of n-butane is observed (Fig. 4B). Instead, the reducibility of the vanadium species are related with the catalytic activity (Fig. 4(A)), as has been proposed in other oxidation reactions [ 13,16,61,69,102]. It seems logical to think that the vanadium oxide reducibility must be favored by a weak bridged V-O- support bond leading to an increase in the catalytic activity. Nevertheless, other catalyst characteristics have been related with the catalytic activity. In this sense, Busca et al. [101] found that the catalytic activity in butane conversion increases with the Lewis acid strength, i.e., (VO)2P207>VOx/TiO2>> Mg vanadate, while C4-olefins are only formed on Mg vanadate. Recently, it has been proposed that the differences in the selectivity to oxyde- hydrogenation reactions with the alkane fed could be controlled, in addition to the type of vanadium species [57], the reducibility of the active sites [101] and/or the distance between active sites [94], by the acid-base character of the catalysts [19,96,103,104]. If we compare the selectivity to olefins during the ODH of n- butane on supported vanadia catalysts with different acid character (Fig. 5), it can be seen that, at low n-butane conversion, the selectivity to C4-olefins is similar in all the catalysts studied, while at high n-butane conversion, the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products progressively decreases from the catalyst with highest basic character (VOffMgO) to the most acid one (VOJA1203) (Fig. 4(B)).

Selectivity to C4-olefins, at n-butane conversions of 10 and 40%, in the ODH of n-butane on supported vanadium oxide catalysts. Catalysts as in Fig. 4, experimental conditions as in Table 4. The hypothesis of the importance of the acid-base character of the catalysts in the ODH of ethane and n-butane has been recently confirmed from the results obtained on both pure and potassium doped vanadium oxide supported on A1203 (Fig. 6) [96]. Vanadium oxide supported on alumina is active and selective in the ODH of ethane, but it shows a low selectivity in the ODH of n-butane. In an opposite trend, the K-doped catalysts are selective in the ODH of n-butane but they show a low selectivity in the ODH of ethane. Since the addition of potassium does not substantially change the type of VOx species formed, and its main effect is to decrease the number of acid sites, the different catalytic performance of the K- doped VO~/A1203 catalysts can be attributed to the variation in the acidity of the catalysts. A similar effect of the presence of alkali metal on the catalytic behavior of TiO2- supported vanadia catalysts [91,92,96,105] and nickel molybdate [106] in the ODH of propane and n-butane, respectively, have also been observed. The incorporation of alkali metal in supported vanadia catalysts decreases both the reducibility of vanadium species and the number of acid sites but increase the basicity of catalysts [91,92,96,105,107]. Moreover, the presence of alkaline or alkali-earth decreases the V=O stretching frequencies (and the cation polarizing power) in VOx/TiO2 catalysts [108]. On the other hand, it has been observed that propene is only physically adsorbed on sodium-doped titania-supported vanadia catalysts while a reduction of vanadium sites is produced during the adsorption of propene on sodium-free catalysts [107]. Recently, it has been reported that the rates of reduction and reoxidation of alkali-doped VzOs/TiO2 catalysts, as well as the selectivity in the ODH of propane, decrease in the order: undoped>Li- >K- > Rb- T.

Vanadium content of catalyst of 4 wt% of V-atom; K/V atomic ratio of 0 (undoped) and 0.7 (K-doped) (see [96]). doped [ 105], suggesting that the better catalytic behavior of doped catalysts could be related to a decrease in the heat of the propene adsorption. Thus, the presence of basic sites and/or the absence of acid sites could favor a higher propene desorption and/or a lower propene adsorption. If this is so, a similar effect can be expected in the case of the ODH of n-butane on alkali-doped alumina-supported vanadia catalysts [96]. On the other hand, and in contrast with the results found in the ODH of propane and n-butane, the presence of acid sites favors better selectivities to ethene during the ODH of ethane. Thus, in addition to silica- and alumina-supported catalysts, it has been observed that the presence of acid sites in V-containing molecular sieve enhances the selectivity to ethene during the ODH of ethane [35,36]. Similar conclusions have been observed during the ODH of ethane on vanadium oxide supported on molecular sieve, in which the higher the acid character of the molecular sieve support the higher the selectivity to ethene [109]. Thus, from the considerations explained above we can conclude that both isolated tetrahedral V5+ species and dymeric and/or polymeric tetrahedral V5+ species are active and selective sites in the ODH of alkanes. However, the catalytic performance of supported vanadia catalysts will also depend on the distance between selective sites, the length of the alkane fed and the acid-base character of catalysts. The appearance of octahedral V5+ species (both isolated or polymeric species) favors the incorporation of oxygen atoms into the olefinic intermediate that, as will be explained later, can be transformed into selective and nonselective oxidation products [57]. 132 T. Blasco, J.M.L Nieto/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 117-142 1.2.2. Kinetic and mechanistic considerations In spite of the large number of paper devoted to the study of the catalytic properties of different materials, only a few of them consider the kinetic aspect of the ODH reactions [90,97,110-114]. According to the catalytic results obtained on several systems, a simplified reaction network, with parallel and consecutive reactions, can be considered (Scheme 1): in which K1, 1(.2 and K3 are kinetic constants. In this reaction network, the initial selectivity to olefin (at low con- version of alkane) will be related to the K1/K2 ratio while at high alkane conversion levels, the selectivity to olefins will be associated to the K1/(K2+K3) ratio. The variation of the selectivity to the oxydehydrogenation products with the alkane conversion were calculated for different constant ratios, considering a first order reaction [113]. The results, shown in Fig. 7, indicate that both the K2 and K3 kinetic constants strongly influence the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation pro- ducts. In addition, selective catalysts can be obtained if the parallel (K2) and/or the consecutive reactions (K3) are eliminated or slowed down. Curves similar to those obtained experimentally on different catalytic systems can be constructed using different ratios of K's, which suggests the suitability of the reaction network shown in Scheme 1 to describe the ODH reaction mechanism. For instance, the experimental curves obtained in the ODH of C2--C4 alkanes on V205 shown in Fig. 1 are quite similar to those obtained for high K3/K1 ratios in Fig. 7, indicating that although olefins are initially formed, they are rapidly transformed into carbon oxides. Similar conclusions have been drawn from the catalytic results obtained during the ODH of propane on vanadium based catalysts [51] or on VOx/TiO2 (four monolayers of V205) catalyst, although in the last case, only the formation of propene and its consecutive reactions are considered [90]: K1 K3 propane---~propene---~COx As has been indicated in the previous section, the acid-base character of the catalyst has an influence on the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products. In order to determine how this parameter can affect the general reaction pathway, the C4-olefin distribution obtained in the ODH of n-butane on supported vanadia catalysts [28,96], summarized in Table 4, must be considered. A 1-butene : cis-2- butene : trans-2-butene ratio of ca. 2.5/1/1 similar to statistical equilibrium (3/1/1) is obtained on basic catalysts (i.e. vanadium oxide supported on magnesia, calcined hydrotalcite and K-doped alumina) while an olefin distribution similar to a thermodynamic equilibrium (1/1/1.1) is observed on acid catalysts (i.e., vanadium oxide supported on alumina or sepiolite) [28,96]. From these results it was concluded that the acid-base character of catalyst probably influences the rate of the parallel and consecutive reactions [28]. However, it is known that 1-butene can isomerize to 2-butene if acid site are present on the catalyst surface [ 115,116]. Thus, the higher selectivity to 2-butenes on acid catalysts could also be favored by 100 i 80 60 '5 40 ~D 20 0 0 I T. Blasco, J.M.L.

A second H-abstraction is necessary to form olefinic inter- mediates that are subsequently desorbed as olefins: From the reaction network shown in Scheme 2, different selectivity-determining steps are possible: (i) the reaction of the surface alkyl species; and (ii) the desorption of the alkene [18,94]. Furthermore, in some cases, it is also possible the formation of alkoxides that can partially decompose to olefins on selective vanadium sites [12,101,117]. In other words, a high selectivity to olefins must be expected if steps 2 and/or 3 in Scheme 2 are rapid, while a deeper oxidation must be favored if they are slow. According to Dadyburjor et al. [10], the olefins (electron-donating molecules) have a higher basic character than the corresponding paraffins, and then they will interact more strongly with acid catalysts than with basic ones. At low n-butane conversions, this stronger interaction with acid catalysts will decrease the deso- rption rate of the adsorbed olefins (step 3 in Scheme 2) favoring the isomerization reactions (high selectivities to 2-butene) leading to a C4-olefins distribution closer to the equilibrium ratio, in agreement with the results shown in Table 4. For this reason, steps 2 and/or 3 have been be proposed as selectivity-determining step at low n-butane conversion, and the acid-base character of the catalysts determines the final C4-olefin distribution [ 103,104]. 60 0 Q \"' 40 .~ ot~l ~ 20 T.

Experimental conditions: T=550 and an alkane/ OJHe molar ratio of 5/20/75 (n-butane) and 4/8/88 (ethane and propane); alkane conversion of 30%. At this point, the influence of the acid-base character of the catalysts on the selectivity to olefins at low conversions (Table 4) can also be extended to high alkane conversions. It can be expected that a stronger olefin adsorption on acid sites during the ODH of n-butane will favor the isomerization (at low alkane conver- sions) and the deep oxidation (at high alkane conversions). However, if olefins are adsorbed near to basic sites they will desorp faster leading to a higher selectivity to olefins, As is shown in Fig. 8 the catalysts that show high selectivities during the ODH of n-butane, i.e. catalysts with a basic character, show a low selectivity during the ODH of ethane, and vice versa on catalyst with an acid character. These differences could, in part, be explained considering the acid-base character of the alkane fed [103,104]. As the basicity of olefins increases with the length of the carbon chain, the olefinic intermediate formed from short chain paraffins, i.e. ethane, will be weakely adsorbed on acid sites, favoring its desorption and then a higher selectivity to olefins. It is clear that in some cases, a different mechanism can occur during the ODH of ethane, specially at high reaction temperatures in which homogeneous or gas phase reactions of the products can also be considered as competitive reactions [17-20,118]. On the other hand, as has been mentioned previously [18,94], alkyl species, specially from alkanes with four or more carbon atoms, can interact simultaneously with two V ions decreasing the selectivity to oxydehy- 136 T. Blasco, J.M.L. Nieto/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 117-142 drogenation reactions. This effect can also produce differences in the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products in the oxidation of n-butane. In this way, the size of the reactants and the distance between the active sites must also be considered. A kinetic study of the ODH of n-butane on Cs-doped nickel molybdate led Madeira et al. [110] to propose that the formation of 1-butene and 2-butene from n- butane could take place through two intermediates formed on two different sites (observed by TPD of CO2) producing 2-butene and 1-butene in the less and more basic sites, respectively. Hydrocarbon adsorption experiments have been carried out in different catalytic systems. In this sense, a low adsorption of propane and propene on a submonolayer VOx/A1203 catalysts is observed [119]. Busca et al. [101] investigated the interaction of butane and butenes with selective V-based catalysts (Mg vanadate, (VO)aP207 and VOx/TiO2) by FTIR. An important aspect of these results is that a low adsorption of both paraffins and olefins is observed on Mg vanadate. In addition, they propose that the catalytic behavior of these systems depend on the efficiency of the different active sites present [21,101]: (i) Lewis acidic V centers acting as alkylic and allylic CH activation sites; (ii) OH's bonded to oxidizing V ions; and (iii) V=O which are oxygen insertion sites. In this way, the selectivity of the Mg vanadate catalyst, in the ODH of propane and n-butane, is in agreement with its soft acid character, the low number of OH and a weak V=O double bond character, while both (VO)2P207 and VOx/TiO2 that show a high selectivity to O- containing products (maleic anhydride and acetic acid, respectively, from n- butane) posses higher acidity and number of OH as well as a stronger V=O bond character. Fig. 9 shows the mechanism proposed for alkane activation on isolated VO4 units [ 18,21,120]. According to the mechanism proposed for the selective oxida- tion of n-butane on VPO catalysts, the first H-abstraction occurs from a secondary carbon atom. However, depending on the catalysts, this abstraction can give rise to the formation of three different intermediates (Fig. 9), that after a second H- abstraction can be transformed into olefins, O-containing partial oxidation pro- ducts or carbon oxides. In this mechanism both the V=O double bond character and the strength of the bridging V-O-Me oxygen bond are essential factors in the final product distribution. In the case of oxydehydrogenation reactions (as is shown in Fig. 10 for n-butane), the second H-abstraction can occur from primary or secondary carbon atoms, which determines the 1-butene/2-butenes ratio in the case of n-butane. In addition to this, as the consecutive reactions can occur via allyl intermediates, a similar catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide catalysts is observed from both 1-butene [116,121] and n-butane. Finally, we must indicate that on most of the catalysts referred previously, olefins and carbon oxides are the main reaction products. Only in some cases, as the oxidation of ethane at low temperature on VOJSiO2 [12] or other vanadium based catalysts as V-Mo-Nb [24,25], oxygenated products can also be formed. T. Blasco, J.M.L.

Mechanism for the oxydehydrogenation of n-butane on isolated WO4 units. As has been previously commented, depending on the reaction conditions, vanadium species with a coordination number higher than four favor the formation of partial oxygenated products or carbon oxides [51]. Table 5 summarizes the catalytic behavior of vanadium based catalysts. The results reported in this Table show that the higher the coordination number and the aggregation state of vanadium species, the higher the O-insertion power is. In addition, the presence of V=O bond help to incorporate oxygen species into the hydrocarbon chain. However, olefins are formed at low n-butane conversions and high butane/oxygen 138 T.

In the selective catalysts in ODH reactions, that permit to obtain moderate selectivities to olefins at relatively high alkane conversions, mainly tetrahedral (isolated and/or dymeric) vS+-species are present. The importance of the coordination number of vanadium species on the nature of selective oxidation reactions can also be concluded from the results obtained, at low and high vanadium content, on both VOxJA1203 or VOx]SiO2. At low V- loading, they are selective in the ODH of ethane and n-butane. However, on catalysts with vanadium loading higher than 50% of the theoretical monolayer (in which octahedral V5+ species with V=O bonds as in V205 are mainly observed), T. Blaseo, J.M.L Nieto /Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 117-142 139 show a poor selectivity to olefins during the oxidation of ethane (COx are mainly formed) [95,97] or n-butane and n-pentane (in which maleic anhydride is mainly observed) [123]. Since, it has been observed that the selectivity to maleic anhydride during the oxidation of benzene [116], 1-butene and 1,3-butadiene [116,124] and furan [125] on supported vanadium oxide catalysts increases when increasing the vanadium loading (from 0 to 5 layers of V205) it can be concluded that V=O double bond is necessary for the O-insertion [17-21,116,120]. Similar conclusions have been reached in the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride on (VO)2P207 [1---4], or in the formation of acetic acid on VOJTiO2 [21,101], as well as in the formation of acrolein during the oxidation of propane on Mg pyrovanadate (MgeV2OT), with a V=O double bond in one of the adjacent corner-sharing VO4 [29]. However, two adjacent V=O double bonds units are not necessary for obtaining not only oxydehydrogenation products but also O-containing partial oxidation compounds. In fact, it is know that n-butane [126] and n-pentane [127] are selectively oxidized to maleic anhydride using molybdovanadophosphoric acids as catalysts, in which isolated V=O double bond units are the active and selective sites. However, and in addition to the presence of V=O double bonds, the presence of acid sites are necessary on selective catalysts for the formation of O-containing product as they facilites the desorption of partial oxidation products. On selective ODH catalysts the presence of acid-base pairs can optimize the formation of olefins [104,105] In conclusion, supported vanadium oxide catalysts appear to be selective materials in the ODH reactions. Several factors can contribute to their catalytic behavior, i.e. coordination number and distance between active sites (dispersion of vanadium species), reducibility of active sites and acid-base character of catalysts and metal oxide support. The characteristics of the catalysts depend on the vanadium content and the nature of the support. The design of new catalytic systems should consider that vanadium must be very dispersed on the metal oxide support. In addition, and concluding from the most selective catalysts, vanadium must be stabilized in a low coordination number in order to limit the consecutive reactions of the formed olefins. However, the presence of V=O double bonds, which occurs on catalysts with high vanadium content, appears to be responsible for the selective O-insertion reactions. The environment of the V-species plays an important role in the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide catalysts. The strength and reducibility of bridging V-O-support oxygen ions determine the catalytic activity of these materials. In addition, the appearance of acid and/or basic sites, that strongly depend on the nature of the metal oxide support, determines the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products depending on the alkane fed. In this way, it appear that the rate of both the formation of the olefinic intermediate and the olefin desorption depend on the acid-base character of catalysts, and they can be considered as selectivity determining steps. 140 T.

Blasco J.M.López Nieto ∗ Instituto de Tecnología Química, UPV-CSIC, Avenida de los Naranjos s/n, 46071 Valencia, Spain ∗ Corresponding author. Tel.: +34 6 3877800; fax: +34 6 3877809. This paper summarizes the main data appeared in the last years on the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of short chain alkanes on supported vanadium oxide catalysts. The acid-base character of metal oxide support influences the dispersion of vanadium on the surface of the support, as well as the nature of the vanadium species. The reducibility and structure of surface vanadium oxide species and the acid-base character of catalysts, in addition to their catalytic properties in the ODH of C2–C4 alkanes, strongly depend on the metal oxide used as support and the vanadium loading. In this way, it appears that tetrahedral V5+-species are active and selective sites in the ODH of C2–C4 alkanes. The effect of the coordination number and aggregation state of surface vanadium oxide species, and the presence of acid/base sites on the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide catalysts are discussed. It is concluded that these are important factors that must be considered to develop selective catalysts in ODH reactions.
