LEPETrr, M. KERMAREC and D. OLIVIER* Laboratoire de Reactivite de Surface et Structure, UA 1106 CNRS, Tour 54 2eme etage, Universite P. et M. Curie, 4, place Jussieu, 75252 Paris Cedex 05 (France) (Received May 26, 1988; accepted July 29,1988) Summary Trialkylphosphines (TAP) are able to reduce silica-supported unsatu- rated Ni(II) cations selectively into Ni(I) at room temperature. This chemical reduction is very convenient because it leads to high amounts of Ni(I) while affording the required ligands to build the propylene oligomerization active entity. The highest reduction degree (60%) is achieved with low nickel content exchanged silicas (r < 2% (w/w)) mainly constituted of isolated three-coordinate Ni(II) cations before reduction. In high nickel content samples, the presence of Ni(II) paired through an oxygen bridge seems to limit reduction by TAP as well as photoreduction. The preparation of NiI(PR3)n (n = 1,2, 3, 4 when R = CHy or C^Hs, and n = 1, 2, 3 when R = c-CgHu or CeH5) is reported. EPR and reflectance spectroscopy parameters of the complexes are given as well as some molec- ular models. From the IR study, two types of hydrogen bond between the trialkylphosphine and the surface hydroxyl groups are evidenced: (i) one is reversibly formed between the phosphorus doublet of TAP adsorbed on the support and a hydrogen atom of a surface OH group; only P(c-C6Hu)3 is basic enough to lead to phosphonium ions. (ii) the other occurs between the alkyi groups of the TAP bonded to the Ni(I) and the surface hydroxyl groups, and could thus explain the distorted symmetry of the unsaturated complexes. Introduction Olefin oligomerization has been widely studied [1] for thirty years since Ziegler discovered the 'Nickel Effect' [2]. A large number of oligomer- ization catalysts are known, but the most active industrial processes are nickel-based homogeneous ones [3], for example the propylene dimerization Dimersol process [4]. However, their heterogenisation appears attractive, as heterogeneous catalysts are easier to handle, facilitate separation and *Present address: Institut de Recherches sur la Catalyse, 2 avenue Albert Einstein, 69626 Villeurbanne Cedex, France. 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 74 recovery of the products, and are generally more stable with regard to time and temperature. 'Catalyst tailoring' [5] is a new way to prepare catalysts within the framework of homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. This method can be very useful for the determination of the reaction pathway and of the struc- ture, composition, electronic configuration, oxidation state of the active centres, because of the close control of the active entity during each step of its preparation. In the Dimersol process, the nature of the catalytic sites has not been entirely clarified [6], but recent studies have suggested Ni(I) [7,8] as the active centre for olefin dimerization in the absence of hydrogen or alkyi ligands. The immobilization of the active entity on a support is a suitable way to stabilize an unusual metal oxidation state [7, 9, 10], limiting migra- tion or dismutation phenomena. We have thus built tailored nickel catalysts, containing a high proportion of well-characterized silica-supported Ni(I) sites with a suitable coordination sphere, in order to dimerize propylene selectively into a-hexenes [11]. From an isolated oxidized precursor, anchored on the support by three surface oxygen atoms, we fashion the active entity and its coordination sphere, which is controlled at each step of the catalyst elaboration by spectroscopic and physical techniques such as EPR, IR, reflectance spec- troscopy, magnetic measurements and temperature-programmed desorption. This involves the four following steps: (1) good dispersion of the precursor cations is obtained by a com- petitive exchange at the surface; (2) by suitable thermal treatment, we form unsaturated precursors which are more easily reduced; (3) the precursors are then selectively reduced by a mild monoelec- tronic process to avoid migration and dismutation; (4) finally, we introduce in the coordination sphere a given number of trialkylphosphine ligands (TAP), which are known to influence the catalytic properties of the homogeneous oligomerization processes [12]. The three last steps of the Ni(I) complex preparation will be described in the present paper. Experimental section Carrier The support is Spherosil XOA 400 silica (specific surface area 400 m2 g~1) supplied by Rhone-Poulenc. For IR experiments, Aerosil 380 (Degussa) was used. Ni(II)/SiO^ oxidized precursor cations Ni(II) cations were dispersed on the support using the competitive exchange. Because of the 'acidic' character of silica, we have performed a 75 competitive cation exchange between nickel hexaammine complexes and am- monium ions on silica at a pH higher than its isoelectric point (I.E.P. = 2) [13]. This method has been described earlier [14 -16]. 17 g of silica are first stirred in 1 liter of an ammoniacal solution (1 M) at pH = 11 for 24 h at 298 K and then centrifugated or filtered. The silica thus ammoniated is then treated for 60 h at 293 K by 1 liter of a solution containing 0.1 mol ?(N03)2-6H20, 4 mol ammonia and x mol NH4N03. After filtration, the exchanged silica is dried in the oven (80 C). When x varies from 1.6 to zero, the sample nickel content (r) varies from 1 to 5.5% (w/w). The resulting diammine-diaquo nickel complex, bound to two silica surface oxygen atoms, has been characterized by reflectance spectroscopy [10, 16]. In order to eliminate water and ammonia from the support and from the coordination sphere of nickel, the exchanged samples are first heated in flowing oxygen up to 773 K at a rate of 100 K h~1, then outgassed overnight at 973 K. Subsequently, the pretreated samples are transferred without air exposure into a reduction or spectroscopic analysis cell. Ni(I) trialkylphosphine complexes Trialkylphosphines supplied by Strem were used without further purification. The chemical reduction of supported pretreated Ni(II) cations is performed at room temperature, by contact with the trialkylphosphine (TAP) either in the gaseous phase (5 torr < PTAP < 300 ton\") during 24 h in a glass cell equipped with an EPR or UV-VIS-near IR cell, or in solution in toluene or heptane. In the latter case, the sample is stirred in a Schlenk tube for 2 h and, after solvent evaporation, the reduced sample is transferred to a spectroscopic analysis cell. With triphenylphosphine, the first method is not suitable because the saturating vapour pressure is too low. Analysis techniques Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded in X or Q band on a CSE 109 Varian spectrometer, equipped with a dual cavity and a subharmonic generator (Telmore instruments) for recording third derivative spectra. The g values were measured relative to a diphenyl- picrylhydrazyl sample (g = 2.0036). Ultraviolet-visible-ear infrared (UV-VIS-NIR) spectra were recorded in the range 200 - 2500 nm on a Beckman 5270 spectrometer, which was equipped for reflectance studies with an integration sphere and a double monochromator, and which used BaSC>4 as the reference. In IR studies, the samples were compressed at 3 ton cm~2 into pellets weighing about 15 mg cm\"2. The thermal treatments were performed inside the IR cell. The transmittance spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Perkin-Elmer 580B spectrometer equipped with a data station, and, when needed, converted to absorbance. Temperature programmed desorption experiments (TPD) were per- formed with a Riber QS mass spectrometer (0-200 uma) with a heating rate of 10 K min-1. 76 Magnetic susceptibilities were measured from 77 to 300 K using the Faraday method [17] with a unit composed of: (i) a BruckerBE 15 electro- magnet (H< 9950 G), (ii) an Oxford CF 200 cryostat and (iii) a Sartorius balance which is able to measure forces from 0.001 mgf to 1.2 gf. CO chemisorption measurements were performed on 100 mg samples using a Texas Instrument pressure gauge, the volumes being determined with helium. Results and discussion Thermal pretreatment The goal of this treatment is to obtain unsaturated, and thus more reducible cations. The resulting oxidized species depends on the exchange degree ( 7-). Low nickel content samples (r < 2% (w/w)) lead mainly to isolated three-coordinate Ni(II) cations bound only to three silica surface oxygen atoms, two of them having a ionic net charge equal to one. These cations, referred to as Ni3c(II) and depicted in Fig. 1, were previously characterized by UV-VIS-NIR spectroscopy [10] (Fig. 2a): (i) by three d-d transitions: v^ = 1613 nm, v^ = 829 nm and v^ which is split into three components: Vy = 690 nm, ^3\" = 524 nm, 1^3'\" = 397 nm (ii) and by three sharp bands observed at 765, 735 and 702 nm. u 11 Fig. 1. Drawing of an isolated Ni3c(II) cation. The reflectance spectra of high nickel content samples (r > 4% (w/w)) show an additional band at 415 nm (Fig. 2b). On silica-copper exchanged samples, Amara et al. [9] observed a similar band in this range. They assigned it to Cu(II) pairs interacting through an oxygen bridge, these pairs being previously identified on the basis of magnetic measurements and spec- troscopic studies (XPS, IR). Assuming similar Ni(II) pairs in our pretreated high nickel content samples, we have performed magnetic measurements after the thermal pretreatment. The results are gathered in Table 1. High nickel loading samples show a subnormal magnetic moment of 3.5 Bohr magneton (JUB) per nickel atom, which corresponds to a super-exchange interaction between nickel cations and is consistent with an oxygen bridge between the two Ni(II) cations. These two experimental results (UV band at 415 nm and the subnormal magnetic moment) agree with the existence of 77 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 7 (A/IOnm) - 13 16 19 (A/100 rim) Fig. 2.

Reduction of precursor cations In order to maintain the well-dispersed sites and to avoid migrations and dismutations, a mild monoelectronic reduction process is needed. Photoreduction The UV photoreduction in hydrogen (77 K) or in carbon monoxide (PCO > 300 torr, 298 K) leads to the selective formation of Ni(I) complexes. 78 TABLE 2 Percentage of Ni(I) obtained after photoirradiation of pretreated samples of different nickel loadings Nickel After photo- After photo- loading reduction in reduction in (%) hydrogen carbon monoxide 1.4 18 2.2 5.5 6.5 1.6 The obtained species and the reduction mechanism have been previously described [18]. The degree of reduction of Ni(II) into Ni(I) has been evaluated either by CO adsorption measurements (photoreduction in H;) or by EPR spin con- centration measurements (photoreduction in CO) [18]. The Ni(I) content of different metal loading UV-photoirradiated samples are summarized in Table 2. Photoreduction in hydrogen is four times more efficient than photoir- radiation in carbon monoxide. This was explained earlier [18] by the kinetic limitations of the latter process. Both methods lead to a degree of reduction in inverse ratio to the sample's nickel content. It has been shown for silica-supported copper samples containing both Cu(II) pairs and isolated Cu(II) cations, that only the latter are photoreduced [9]. By analogy, our results suggest that in the high nickel content samples, the Ni(II) pairs are insensitive to photoreduc- tion. Two possible explanations are: (i) either the charge transfer energy of the Ni 0 (or Cu 0) bond of the metal 0 metal pairs is not in the range of the UV radiations we have used, (ii) or the Ni(II) cations are not sufficiently unsaturated in the pairs, as it has been previously shown that Ni3c(II) are more easily reduced than four-coordinate Ni(II) species [15]. In a pretreated sample, for which the exchange degree is T, the per- centage of isolated Ni3c(II) cations is assumed to be r', while the percentage of Ni(II) pairs is r\". If the limitation of the photoreduction degree (a) is due only to the irreducibility of the Ni(II) pairs, this reduction degree should vary with the proportion of isolated cations, and this for the photoreduction under H; as well as under CO. We can thus write: a(r, H;) = k-aT' when the photoreduction is carried out in H;; Q;(r, CO) = kcor when the photoreduction is carried out in CO. The same reduction method applied to different nickel loadings Ti and r^ would lead to the following ratio R: 79 , , (Ti,H^) TI' ^H,(Tl, T,) = = ^ a(T2,H2) T2 , , _ (Ti.CO) _ T; ^CO^l > 7-2) - ; .^.T ~ ? a(T2,CO) T2 and consequently: ^H,(T'I 7-2) = ^co^ii ^ As our experimental results show that Ru(lA, 5.5) = 3 is not equal to Rco(lA, 5.5) = 1.4, it appears that this ratio is not simply connected with the number of Ni(II) pairs and that additional reasons must be put forward to explain the more limited photoreduction of high nickel content samples. In any case, photoreduction leads to a low reduction degree and more- over is not suitable to the preparation of large amounts of catalyst; thus we have looked for a better chemical reducer. Trialkylphosphines (TAP) are convenient because they selectively reduce Ni(II) to Ni(I) while affording the ligands required to form the active complex. Chemical reduction by trialkylphosphines (TAP) Control of the number of TAP ligands in the Ni(I) coordination sphere: Trialkylphosphine transition metal complexes catalyse a large number of homogeneous reactions, such as hydrogenation, hydroformylation or polymerization. The TAP ligands lead to the steric and electronic environ- ment required to obtain the best catalytic properties [6,19, 20]. But TAP have been very little used to reduce transition metal cations [21 - 25], and their ability to reduce supported Ni(II) cations has never been observed before [26]. By contacting the unsaturated precursors with TAP either in the gaseous phase or in toluene or heptane solution, the sample's colour changes, while an EPR signal with a g tensor in the range of d9 ions is observed. The large ferromagnetic signal characteristic of Ni(0) has never been obtained. In order to compare the electronic and steric influence of the ligands on the catalyst properties [II], we have used a set of TAP ligands which have different Lewis basicity [27] and alkyi substituents [28] of varying bulk: P(CH3)3 = PMea = TMP; P(C2Hs)3 = PEt3 = TEP P(c-C6Hu)3 = Pcy3 = TCP; P(C6Hs)3 = PPh3 = TPP The number of TAP ligands in the nickel coordination sphere is controlled by outgassing at well-defined temperatures the samples reduced by an excess of TAP. The complexes thus prepared were characterized by EPR and reflec- tance spectra. The symmetry of the supported Ni(I) complexes was deter- mined from the comparison of their reflectance spectra with those described in the literature for similar organometallic Ni(I) complexes. The discussion of the EPR spectra is based on a self-consistent analysis of: 80 (i) the g tensor components, which give the symmetry of the environ- ment of the paramagnetic 3d9 Ni(I) ions; (ii) the relative order of the g tensor components, which indicates the probable ground state of the single electron; (hi) the superhyperfine (shf) structure due to 31? (7= 1/2), from which the number of TAP ligands can be deduced; (iiii) the comparison of the X band (v ^ 9 GHZ) and Q band (v 36 GHZ) spectra, which allows shf structures to be distinguished from species mixtures. The spectroscopic parameters and the preparation conditions are gathered in Table 3.

When the TAP pressure decreases and the outgassing temperature increases, complexes (4) to (1) are formed according to Scheme 1: 81 Ni^PR^OJ ^==i N?3)3(0,) + PRa (4) (3) [ NiI(PR3)2(Os)2 + 2PR3 ;== : NiI(PR3)(Os)2 + 3PR3 (2) (1) Og = surface oxygen atom ligand; R = Me or Et Scheme 1. The PMe3 spectra are very similar to those of PEt3, for which a detailed identification of the complexes has been already given [29]. (4) is a five- coordinate square pyramidal complex in which Ni(I) is bound to four equivalent TAP and one surface oxygen atom of a net ionic charge equal to one. (3) is a four-coordinate complex with three TAP ligands and attached to the surface by one oxygen atom; the UV spectra are in good agreement with a tetrahedral structure for PMe^ (only one absorption [30, 31] at 850 nm (Table 3)) or a pseudo-tetrahedral structure for PEt3 (two UV absorption bands [32, 33] see Table 3). (2) is a square planar complex where Ni(I) is bound to two non-equivalent TAP ligands and to two surface oxygen atoms: one of them acts as a negative monovalent ligand, whereas the other is a neutral o-donor ligand. (1) is a very unsaturated three-coordinate complex bound to only one TAP ligand and anchored to the surface by two oxygen atoms, one of them having a negative ionic charge. When the outgassing is performed above 400 C, NiI(Os)3 sites are evidenced using an IR CO probe [27], while a large intense EPR signal is observed. This latter can be assigned to carbon produced by the TAP decomposition. Temperature-programmed desorption studies performed with PMe3 indeed show that the decomposition of the TMP begins at 200 C and is accompanied at its end (at ~400 C) by carbon formation. These Ni(I) sites are different from those obtained after photoreduction in H;, because they can no longer coordinate two CO ligands. Even under a CO pressure of 200 torr, only one CO ligand can be introduced in the Ni(I) coordination sphere. These sites have certainly been modified by the TAP decomposition. They are stable up to 550 C. Though PEt3 and Pcy3 have the same vapour pressure, their reaction with Ni(II) is different. When Ni3c(II) reacts with an excess of Pcy, (m toluene solution (c 10~3 mol 1~1) or in gaseous phase with Ppcy > 300 torr), the sample turns from beige to violet. The reflectance spectrum (Fig. 4a) shows three d-d transitions bands: Bi = 900 nm, 83 = 625 nm, 83 = 535 nm and an additional charge transfer band C; = 335 nm. The EPR spectrum, recorded in the same experimental conditions, presents an orthorhombic pseudo-axial signal (Fig. 5) and the g tensor is described by: gi = 2.640, g-i = 2.121 and ^3 = 2.083; no shf structure is observed. The UV bands of species B are observed in the wavelength range expected for pseudo- tetrahedral complexes [32, 33]. By comparison with the EPR and UV-VIS- NIR spectra previously observed with PEta and PMe3, we propose assigning the UV bands B to a pseudo-tetrahedral Ni(I) complex: NiI(Pcy3)3(Os). 82 Fig. 4. Reflectance spectra of a sample containing 1.4% by weight of nickel: (a) reduced by a toluene solution of Pcy3, (b) 500 mg reduced by 6 ton- of Pcy3, (c) reduced by an excess of gaseous Pcy3, then outgassed at 100 C.

Adsorption at a lower TCP pressure onto Ni3c(II) (5 ton\" onto a 500 mg sample), changes the colour from beige to brown. The corresponding reflec- tance spectrum (Fig. 4b) exhibits only two bands: Ci = 495 nm and C^ = 335 nm, without any absorption band higher than 500 nm. Two paramag- netic species are observed in the same conditions (Fig. 6), with the following g tensor components deduced from the Q band spectra: (i) species C: gy = 2.190 and ^i = 2.061; on the X band spectra, a non- equivalent coupling of the unpaired electron with two ^P nuclei is observed on the perpendicular component: A^i = 50 G and A^ = 30 G. 83 Fig. 6. ESR spectra (77 K) of a 500 mg pretreated sample (nickel content = 1.4% (w/w)) reduced by 5 ton- of Pcy3. Curve 1 = Q band, curve 2 = X band. Fig. 7. ESR spectra (77 K) of a nickel-exchanged silica (1.4% (w/w)) reduced by an excess of gaseous Pcya, then outgassed at 100 C. Curve 1 = Q band, curve 2 = X band. (ii) species D: g^=2.130>gy= 2.016 \"age; m X band, the perpendicular component is split into two lines of equivalent intensity, showing the coupling of the unpaired electron with one 31? nucleus. After outgassing at 100 C, the reflectance spectrum (Fig. 4c) is greatly simplified, Ci and C; disappear, and only a broad band of D is observed at about 400 nm. In the same experimental conditions, the EPR signal of D increases at the expense of C (Fig. 7). The relative order of g tensor components of species C suggests an axial symmetry and a d^i-yi. ground state. The UV and EPR spectra thus agree with a Ni(I) site (d9 ion) in a square planar symmetry [29, 34, 36]. The non-equivalent coupling with the two TCP ligands suggests a distorted structure for the corresponding Ni^Pcy 3)2(03)2 complex. The EPR spectrum of D is typical of a Ni(I) complex of an axial sym- metry and in a d^i ground state, with only one TCP ligand. As the reflectance spectrum does not exhibit any band in the range 400 -1000 nm, species D cannot be square planar or tetrahedral. Similar reflectance spectra have been reported for three-coordinate Ni(I) complexes in a distorted Dy^ or C3v symmetry [29,34]. Generally a d^_y2 ground state is expected for three- coordinate Ni(I) complexes, but for some geometries a d^ ground state was observed [35]. From these results we assigned D to the Ni^Pcya^O^ complex. TCP is very bulky, this explains that no more than three TCP ligands can be introduced in the nickel coordination sphere. In addition, complex 84 B has a distorted tetrahedral structure (suggested by its orthorhombic g tensor) and the high value of g^ suggests a low ligand field and thus a weakened and elongated Ni P bond. It is interesting to point out that in homogeneous organometallic chemistry the same effects are observed: the more bulky the alkyi substituents, the more elongated the metal- phosphorus bond [28a] and the lower the coordination. The unsaturated complex D, which is the only complex active in propylene dimerization, can be prepared without thermal treatment in the case of TCP. This is important, as this thermal outgassing is often accom- panied by the decomposition of some TAP ligands and may generate catalyst poisons. We have actually observed that Ni^PcyaXOg); prepared without thermal outgassing is more active than that prepared by a 100 C outgassing [11]. At room temperature and pressure, triphenylphosphine is a white solid, having a low saturating vapour pressure. The Ni3c(II) reduction must be performed in toluene or heptane TPP solution. In the presence of an excess of TPP, the EPR spectrum (Fig. 8) is characteristic of a pseudo-tetrahedral NiI(PPh3)3(Os) complex (see above for the analysis of the spectrum). A prolongated outgassing at 200 C leads to the square planar complex Ni^PPl^z^g);; on the corresponding EPR spectrum (Fig. 9), the non- equivalent coupling of the two TPP ligands with the unpaired electron is observed on both perpendicular and parallel components of the g tensor. After outgassing at higher temperature, the Ni(I) dismutation is observed without intermediate formation of Ni^PPl^Os);. Whatever the TAP used, the same supported Ni^TAP),, species are obtained when a UV photoreduction is performed before the TAP adsorp- tion and the following outgassing at the suitable temperature.

TAP interaction with the silica support. Tertiary phosphines are known to form stable complexes with Bronsted or Lewis acids. The above-described complexes are examples of the latter. According to Pearson classification [37], TAP are soft bases which interact better with soft acids. However, we can also expect a reaction between the TAP and Bronsted acids such as the silica surface hydroxyl groups. TAP and TAP oxides are indeed increasingly used as acidity probes in zeolites or silica-aluminas [38 - 40]. In this work, we have studied by IR spectroscopy the TAP interactions with the silica support, the IR characterization of silica-supported Ni^CO)- (TAP)n complexes (n < 3) being described elsewhere [27]. IR spectra obtained after adsorption of 1 - 3 torr of various TAP on the pretreated oxidized precursors or on the pretreated support are respec- tively depicted in Figs. lOa and lOb. Stretching and deformation vibrations of the C H bonds of the phosphorus alkyi substituents appear respectively in the ranges 2850 - 3000 and 1400 -1500 cm\"1. Simultaneously a broad band (v^ = 3420 cm\"1 - TCP), which is characteristic of surface hydroxyl groups involved in a hydrogen bond and with a heterogeneous environment, appears at the expense of the sharp band observed after the pretreatment at 3745 cm~1 (assigned to free surface hydroxyl groups). In the case of Pcy3, two additional bands are observed. One (split into two close bands on nickel-exchanged silica samples) at about 2290 cm~1 can be assigned to the P H bond of a phosphonium ion [37, 38, 41]. This phosphonium ion is not observed with PMe3 or PEt3. Those ligands thus appear not basic enough to extract a proton from the silica surface, in agreement with the increasing basicity classification [42]: PMe3 PEt3< Pcy3. The other one at v 3700 cm~1 lies in the range of weak OH inter- actions. (cm'') (en,-') 87 (c) (cm\"') Pig. 10. (a) IR spectra of a nickel-exchanged Aerosil (2.7% (w/w)): (1) pretreated at 700 C, (2) after adsorption of 3 torr of PEt3, (3) after adsorption of 1 ton- of Pcy3; (b) IR spectra of an Aerosil pellet (1) pretreated at 700 C, (2) after adsorption of 1 torr of Pcys; (3) after adsorption of 1 torr of Pcy3 followed by 15 h evacuation at room temperature; (c) IR spectra of a nickel-exchanged Aerosil (2.7% (w/w)) (1) after adsorp- tion of 1 torr of Pcya followed by 15 h evacuation at room temperature, (2) after adsorp- tion of 1 torr of Pcy3 followed by 2 h evacuation at 100 C, (3) after adsorption of 1 torr of Pcy3 followed by prolonged evacuation at 500 C. On the nickel-free samples, the phosphonium ion vibrations as well as the small band at v are completely removed by outgassing at room temperature during 15 h (Fig. lOb). The formation of the phosphonium ion seems thus to be reversible at room temperature, following eqn. (2): Pcy3 + s=Si OH 1 ton- vacuum HPcy3 + SiCT (2) In the same experimental conditions, on nickel-exchanged silica samples, the phosphonium ions seem to be more strongly retained. This suggests an increase in the surface acidity due to the nickel, as has been observed on silica-aluminas [43]. In the same way, the band at v remains and its intensity seems to be correlated to the intensity of the phosphonium ion vibrations. It could thus correspond to an interaction involving phosphonium ions and surface OH groups. 88 After prolonged outgassing at room temperature of the free nickel samples, TAP C H vibrations have almost completely disappeared and the initial intensity of the band associated with the free surface hydroxyl groups is almost entirely restored (Fig. lOb); the small band near 3500 cm~1 seems to be connected to a small amount of TAP still adsorbed. In contrast, in the same experimental conditions, TAP C H vibrations are still observed on nickel-containing samples (Fig. lOc); the broad band at v^ is no longer observed, whereas a band at v-^ = 3620 cm~1 appears. This latter was certainly hidden by the broad band v^ under excess TAP. When the outgassing is performed up to 100 C, the spectra of nickel-exchanged samples do not change; one notices however a decrease in the intensity of the bands assigned to TAP alkyi substituents (Fig. lOc). After prolonged outgassing at 500 C, TAP is completely removed while the initial intensity of the vibration assigned to free surface OH groups is entirely restored. These experimental results suggest that the broad band i^ corresponds to an interaction between the TAP adsorbed on the support and the surface OH groups, as it is indeed removed after prolonged outgassing at room temperature, on nickel-free samples as well as on nickel-containing samples. The v-i band is observed only in the presence of nickel and remains after evacuation at 100 C, while TAP is no longer adsorbed on the support. This band can thus be assigned to a hydrogen bond between TAP bonded to the nickel and surface OH groups. Two possible types of hydrogen bond between the TAP and the surface are possible; they are depicted in Fig. 11. In a type 1 interaction, the hydrogen atom of the surface hydroxyl group interacts with the phosphorus doublet, whereas in the type 2 interaction, a hydrogen atom of the alkyi substituent of the phosphorus atom interacts with the oxygen doublet of the surface OH group. One expects that the vibration of OH groups involved in a type 1 interaction will be lower than the vibration of OH groups involved in a type 2 interaction. We thus propose to assign the band at Vi to a type 1 interaction and v^ to a type 2 interaction. This latter, involving a hydrogen atom of the alkyi groups of the TAP bonded to the Ni(I) and the oxygen doublet of a surface hydroxyl group, could explain the distorted symmetry of the unsaturated complexes. Molecular models of N^TAP complexes. In order to obtain a better spatial representation of the supported Ni^TAP),, complexes, we have built scale molecular models. The bond lengths in the Ni^TAP) entity are taken to be similar to those of the analogous organometallic complexes: Ni P: 2.20 A [30], P-C: 1.80 A [31], C-C: 1.54 A, C-H: 1.10 A [44], the Ni 0 bond length is that of nickel oxide: 2.1 A (NaCI structure, a = 4.20 A) [44]. Silica can be considered as a mineral macropolymer where the SiO^' monomers are bound by their comers. It is an amorphous solid with crystal- line microareas. In the various crystalline forms such as cristobalite, tridymite or quartz, the Si 0 bond length is about 0.161 nm and the 89 R^P1..........H 0. y0 0/\"\\0 Type I interaction O'W,. / H>^......^\"0 0X0 Type 2 interaction involving TMP adsorbed on the support / ~ /Ni'-^ / / 0 (CH,),? /H \\/ C /\"^ H^H......^ \\ ^H Type 2 interaction involving a TMP ligand bound to the Ni1 Fig. 11. The two possible types of hydrogen bond between the TAP ligands and the surface hydroxyl groups. Si O Si angle is respectively 152, 120-140, 143 degrees [45]. In our models we have considered the amorphous surface as a tangle of small entities containing three Si044\" tetrahedron bound by their comers and in the same orientation; such entities have been observed in the glasses. This model seems more correct to us than a model based on one crystalline struc- ture. Figure 12 represents the molecular model of the unsaturated Ni^Pcya);- (Os)2 complex. Even with only one TCP ligand in the coordination sphere, it is clear that the available space for the reactants is very small, which may explain the decrease in activity of this catalyst as compared to that of Ni^l^a [11]. Furthermore, we can see that a hydrogen bond may occur between the TCP bonded to the nickel and the surface hydroxyl groups. Titration of the Ni(I) sites. When TAP are used as chemical reducers of Ni3c(II), the calculation of the reduction degree is obtained from CO chemisorption measurements. A previous EPR study [29] has shown that in presence of one or two TAP ligands, no more than two CO ligands could be introduced in the Ni(I) coordination sphere when ?co < 400 torr, and the following equilibria have been established: PCQ = 260 torr Ni^PRaXO^ \\ Ni^PRa^CO^O^ (3) 90 Fig. 12. Molecular model of Ni^PcyaXOg)^ PCO = 250 torr Ni^PR^O^ . Ni^PRgMCOHO^ (4) In the same experimental conditions, we have checked by IR spec- troscopy that the unreduced Ni(II) ions are saturated by the TAP ligands and do not chemisorb CO. We have thus drawn the isothermal CO adsorption graphs for various Ni(I) complexes containing one or two TAP ligands. With both type of complexes, according to equilibria 3 and 4, we indeed observed a linear region on the graph when Pco ^ 250 torr. But in the case of monoTAP complexes, no intermediate linear region (corresponding to the intermediate formation of Ni^TAP^COKO^) was observed (Fig. 13). In agreement with previous spectroscopic studies [30], this suggests that between Pco = 5 torr and Pco = 250 torr, the system is composed of a mixture of mono- and di-TAP complexes. From these graphs, we can determine the number of CO molecules chemisorbed by the sample at the equilibrium pressure of 250 torr. This number is correlated to the number of Ni(I) sites by: \"CO : equilibrium (3) \"Ni(I) = \"NKD = \"co: equilibrium (4) As the weight and the nickel content of the samples are known, it is easy to calculate the monovalent nickel amount. 91 100 200 300 pressure (torr) ^- Fig. 13.

TABLE 4 Percentage of Ni(I) obtained after reduction by different TAP of pretreated samples of different nickel loading Nickel After chemical After chemical loading reduction reduction (%) byTEP by TCP 1.7 57 46 6.5 16 The results are gathered in Table 4. They are consistent with EPR spin concentration measurements. The EPR signal of Ni^TAP);^); and of Ni^CO^O^ (for which the sym- metry, the g tensor and the nickel content are similar) were compared. The Ni(I) content of the latter complex, prepared by photoreduction in H; of Ni3c(II) followed by a 5 torr CO adsorption, was known. As in the case of photoreduction, it appears that the reduction degree varies in inverse ratio to the nickel loading of the samples, suggesting that Ni(II) pairs are not reduced by TAP, but this reduction method is three times more efficient than UV photoirradiation. Conclusion From well-defined silica-supported Ni(II) cations, we have built supported Ni(I) complexes with one to four TAP ligands and two or one surface oxygen atoms acting as ligand in their coordination sphere. These complexes have been well characterized by EPR and reflectance spec- troscopy, and molecular models have been built. 92 This unusual nickel oxidation state was achieved by using mild (T< 300 K) monoelectronic reduction methods such as photoreduction in hydrogen or carbon monoxide, or TAP chemical reduction at room tempera- ture. In both cases, the reduction degree depends on the kind of oxidized precursors resulting from the thermal pretreatment. After the thermal treatment, low nickel loading exchanged silicas are mainly composed of unsaturated isolated Ni(II) cations, bound to only three surface oxygen atoms, while high nickel loading exchanged silicas contain also Ni(II) cations paired through an oxygen bridge and bound to three surface oxygen atoms. These Ni(II) pairs seem to be insensitive to both photoreduction and TAP reduction. The highest reduction degrees are thus obtained with the lowest nickel loading samples. The TAP reduction is however faster, easier and more efficient than UV photoirradiation, and leads in the best experimental conditions to a reduction degree of 60%. Ni^TAP),, complexes (n = 4 to n = 1) have been prepared. (4) (see Scheme 1) is obtained only with PMes and PEt3; it is a five-coordinate square pyramidal complex in which Ni(I) is bound to four equivalent TAP and one surface oxygen atom of a net ionic charge equal to one. (3) is atetrahedral (PMea) or pseudo-tetrahedral (PEt3, Pcyg, PPl^) complex with three TAP ligands and attached to the surface by one oxygen atom. (2) is a square planar complex where Ni(I) is bound to two non-equivalent TAP ligands and to two surface oxygen atoms: one of them acts as a negative monovalent ligand, whereas the other is a neutral o-donor ligand. (1) is a very un- saturated three-coordinate complex bound to only one TAP ligand and anchored to the surface by two oxygen atoms, one of them having a negative ionic charge. The distorted symmetry of the unsaturated complexes (2) and (1) may be explained by an interaction between a hydrogen atom of the alkyi substituents of the phosphorus atom and surface hydroxyl groups. We have now at our disposal a set of well-defined Ni(I) complexes with a given number of TAP ligands of different electronic and steric properties in the nickel coordination sphere. These complexes will be particularly convenient for the study of the electronic and steric influence of TAP ligands in propylene dimerization. References 1 (a) V. Sh. Fei'dblyum and N. V.

Lepetit M. Kermarec D. Olivier ∗ Laboratoire de Réactivité de Surface et Structure, UA 1106 CNRS, Tour 54 2ème étage, Université P. et M. Curie, 4, place Jussieu, 75252 Paris Cedex 05 France * Present address: Institut de Recherches sur la Catalyse, 2 avenue Albert Einstein, 69626 Villeurbanne Cédex, France. Trialkylphosphines (TAP) are able to reduce silica-supported unsaturated Ni(II) cations selectively into Ni(I) at room temperature. This chemical reduction is very convenient because it leads to high amounts of Ni(I) while affording the required ligands to build the propylene oligomerization active entity. The highest reduction degree (60%) is achieved with low nickel content exchanged silicas (τ < 2% (w/w)) mainly constituted of isolated three-coordinate Ni(II) cations before reduction. In high nickel content samples, the presence of Ni(II) paired through an oxygen bridge seems to limit reduction by TAP as well as photoreduction. The preparation of NiI(PR3) n (n = 1,2, 3, 4 when R = CH3 or C5H5, and n = 1, 2, 3 when R = c-C6H11or C6H5) is reported. EPR and reflectance spectroscopy parameters of the complexes are given as well as some molecular models. From the IR study, two types of hydrogen bond between the trialkylphosphine and the surface hydroxyl groups are evidenced: (i) one is reversibly formed between the phosphorus doublet of TAP adsorbed on the support and a hydrogen atom of a surface OH group; only P(c-C6H11)3 is basic enough to lead to phosphonium ions. (ii) the other occurs between the alkyl groups of the TAP bonded to the Ni(I) and the surface hydroxyl groups, and could thus explain the distorted symmetry of the unsaturated complexes.

        "dc:description": "Trialkylphosphines (TAP) are able to reduce silica-supported unsaturated Ni(II) cations selectively into Ni(I) at room temperature. This chemical reduction is very convenient because it leads to high amounts of Ni(I) while affording the required ligands to build the propylene oligomerization active entity. The highest reduction degree (60%) is achieved with low nickel content exchanged silicas (τ < 2% (w/w)) mainly constituted of isolated three-coordinate Ni(II) cations before reduction. In high nickel content samples, the presence of Ni(II) paired through an oxygen bridge seems to limit reduction by TAP as well as photoreduction. The preparation of NiI(PR3) n (n = 1,2, 3, 4 when R = CH3 or C5H5, and n = 1, 2, 3 when R = c-C6H11or C6H5) is reported. EPR and reflectance spectroscopy parameters of the complexes are given as well as some molecular models. From the IR study, two types of hydrogen bond between the trialkylphosphine and the surface hydroxyl groups are evidenced: (i) one is reversibly formed between the phosphorus doublet of TAP adsorbed on the support and a hydrogen atom of a surface OH group; only P(c-C6H11)3 is basic enough to lead to phosphonium ions. (ii) the other occurs between the alkyl groups of the TAP bonded to the Ni(I) and the surface hydroxyl groups, and could thus explain the distorted symmetry of the unsaturated complexes.",
