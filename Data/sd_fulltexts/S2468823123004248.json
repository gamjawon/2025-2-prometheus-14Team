Inspired by the work of Sargent et al. (Nature, 2020, 581, 178–183), the oxophilic Al atom was introduced into the Cu(111) surface to design a Al/Cu(111) bimetallic catalysts for implementing electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction based on the first-principles calculations. The results indicate that introduction of the oxophilic Al atom into the Cu(111) surface effectively improves the CO2 adsorption ability via formation of a Alδ+- (Cu6)δ− configuration on the Al/Cu(111) surface. And the adsorbed CO2 was easily reduced to CO via a unique dissociated adsorption process induced by the oxophilic Al center. Our energy calculations show that introduction of the Al atom into the Cu(111) surface is both thermodynamically and kinetically favorable for CO dimerization when compared with the pristine Cu(111) surface. And the Al center acts as an electron-transfer medium for the coupling of two CO molecules over Al/Cu(111) surface. Finally, our mechanism investigation shows that the presence of oxophilic Al atom in the Cu(111) surface effectively improves the selectivity of ethanol product via the formation of the Al-O bond along the hydrogenation path.

Although various electrocatalytic systems have been developed for CO2RR, most of them are energy demanding and low efficient. To date, from the energy balance point of view there are few effective electrocatalytic systems can convert CO2 to more valuable chemicals due to chemically inert of CO2 [4,5]. Development and engineering of novel electrocatalysts for CO2RR have been considered as a promising route to improve the energy balance sheet. Owing to the high activity and non-noble metal, Cu-based electrocatalysts have attracted considerable attention in the field of electrochemical CO2RR. However, they suffer from low selectivity [6–14]. Several carbon-containing products can be obtained on the surface of Cu-based electrocatalyst in the CO2RR [15 ]. Improving the selectivity of the Cu-based electrocatalyst for CO2RR is thus highly desirable. The reduction of CO2 on Cu-based electrodes still has rather wide product distributions. How to design Cu-based electrodes capable of enhancing selectivity toward multi-carbon products at large fluxes and low prepotentials is still a challenging task for CO2RR [16,17]. Among the various hydrocarbon products, ethanol is more desirable considering its important role as a feedstock for the chemical industry and its existence as a liquid fuel. In the initial reduction steps, CO2 is always reduced to HCOOH or CO intermediates via two different pathways, in which the HCOOH path is associated with the adsorption configuration of CO2 on catalyst surface via M-OCO band, and CO path is relative to the adsorption configuration of CO2 on catalyst surface via M-CO2 bond [18,19]. Moreover, CO is always viewed as the key intermediate for reduction of CO2 to C2+ products. Based on such viewpoint, various metals are assumed to improve the selectivity of Cu-based catalysts to C2 products because metals can provide unique site to tune the ratio between M-C and M-O adsorption configurations. There are many reports of Cu-based bimetallic catalysts, such as Cu-Au, Cu-Ag, Cu-Sn, and Cu-Pd, etc. [20–27]; however, the selectivity of CO2RR is still low and quite different among these reports. Li and co-workers synthesized Cu1-xAgx (x = 0.05–0.2) bimetallic catalyst with an increased ratio between C2 liquid products (ethanol and acetate) and C1 liquid product (HCOOH) [28]. Operando synchrotron radiation Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that introduction of Ag into the Cu phase effectively strengthens the adsorbed *CO and *OCCO intermediates and suppresses the O-C-O intermediate. In another case, Alexis et al. prepared Cu-Ag bimetallic electrode in Ar atmosphere. They found that the introduction of Ag into the Cu phase causes the lattice strain and changes the valence band structure, which reduces the aerobic property of Cu and tunes the adsorption capacity for the key intermediate of the electroreduction path in CO2RR. And thus, the catalytic performance of the bimetallic catalyst was effectively improved [29]. Xia and co-workers reported that a Pb-alloyed Cu alloy can exclusively covert CO2 into formate with high activity in excess of 1A cm−2. They found that the modulated Cu atoms are the active sites for converting CO2 into formate rather than the isolated Pb atom based on in-situ spectroscopic evidence and theoretical calculations [30]. Sargent and co-workers found that an iron-doped Cu catalyst can convert CO2 to methane with a Faradaic efficiency of 64% and a partial current density of 128 mA cm-2. The activity of this iron-doped Cu bimetallic catalyst is found to be 32 times higher than a pristine Cu under the same reaction conditions. According to in-situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, they proposed that the iron atoms play the key role to attract surrounding intermediates and carry out hydrogenation to generate methane [31]. Head-Gordon and co-workers screened 28 bimetallic catalyst as novel electrocatalyst for CO2RR by using DFT calculations and the Poisson-Boltzmann implicit solvation model. They found that Rh/Au(100) and Rh/Ag(100) surface can efficiently reduce CO2 to methane with as small as 40% and 10% loss to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. And the minimum applied voltages to drive the two electrocatalytic systems was calculated to be -1.01 and -1.12 VRHE for Rh/Au(100) and Rh/Ag(100) catalysts, respectively [32]. All these findings show that the activity and selectivity of CO2RR can be flexibly tuned by combining composition, morphology, and surface structure of metal-alloyed Cu alloy. Although many studies have focused on electrocatalyst improvement for CO2RR by using Cu-based materials, reaction mechanism of Cu-based catalysts in CO2RR is still controversial. Various surface characterization technologies, such as operando surface-enhanced Raman scattering, differential electrochemical mass spectrometry measurements, in situ surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopic measurements and isotope exchange experiments, have been employed to capture and identify the key reaction intermediates on the surface of Cu-based catalysts [33–45]. However, only few intermediates have been identified because of the high activity and low surface coverage of these surface intermediates. Direct observation of the surface intermediates and the interaction with Cu-based electrode surfaces during the CO2RR is still an extremely challenging task. By contrast, theoretical approaches, especially DFT studies, provide the great advantages for exploring the possible reaction pathways towards the desired product both thermodynamically and kinetically [46]. Recently, Sargent and co-workers found that Cu-Al bimetallic alloy is the most promising for active and selective CO2 reduction based on DFT simulations, active machine learning, and experimental verification, in which 12,229 surfaces and 228,969 adsorption sites were enumerated to develop their machine-learning accelerated, high-throughput DFT framework [47]. Moreover, activity and selectivity for electroreduction of CO2 to C2H4 over a Al incorporated Cu(100) surface have verified based on their DFT calculations. Despite such research efforts on the bimetallic Cu-Al electrocatalyst for CO2RR, the understanding of the surface structure at the theoretical level and the role of the oxophilic Al atom for activation of CO2 molecule have not been studied in details. The possible reaction paths and mechanistic studies of the CO2RR on the surface of bimetallic Cu-Al electrocatalyst have been performed by using both experimental and theoretical methods, investigating the effects of the Al atom on the selective reduction of CO2 to ethanol does not exist yet. These results encourage us to design a bimetallic Cu-Al electrocatalyst with high activity and selectivity in CO2RR by using periodic DFT calculations. The Al atom with low electronegativity relevant to Cu atom was introduced into the Cu phase to form a Al/Cu(111) bimetallic catalyst with a Alδ+-Cuδ- surface configuration, which have the potential to adsorb inert CO2 molecule with a Oδ−=Cδ+=Oδ− configuration via a strong electrostatic force (see Chart 1 ). And thus, the CO2 molecule could be adsorbed on the metal surface with a unique double-site configuration via Al-O and Cu-C bonds. Meanwhile, the oxophilic Al element results in a rare dissociated adsorption path to produce CO intermediate. This dissociated process is calculated to be exoergic by 0.14 eV, which is superior to the Cu–Ag composites (0.43 eV) and CuNi nanoparticles (0.58 eV) with an endergonic process [48,49]. The calculated thermodynamic barrier for CO dimerization (0.19 eV) over the Al/Cu(111) surface is much lower than that of two-dimensional Fe2P2S6 nanosheet (0.35 eV) and atomic layer deposition of TiO2 on MoS2 nanosheet (0.67 eV) [50,51]. The rate-determining step for reduction of CO2 to ethanol over the Al/Cu(111) surface is found to be hydrogenation of CH3CH2O* to CH3CH2OH* with a free energy barrier of 0.39 eV, which is lower than reduction of CO2 to ethanol over the CuNi nanoparticles (0.85 eV) [49]. Thus, this Al/Cu(111) bimetallic catalyst displays much high activity and selectivity of ethanol production when compared with several reported Cu-based catalysts. 2 Computational details The Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) functional of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [52] and the projector augmented wave (PAW) [53,54] pseudopotentials as implemented in the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) [55,56] were used for all calculations. The Al@Cu(111) and pristine Cu(111) surfaces were modeled by a four-layered slab using a (4 × 4) periodic cell. In the case of structural optimization of all surfaces, the upper two layers and the adsorbates were relaxed, while atoms in the bottom layers were fixed. The convergence threshold for geometry optimizations was set to 0.01 eV/Å in force. A cutoff energy of 400 eV was applied for the plane-wave basis set. A vacuum of 15 Å was used for the slab calculations to prevent interactions between the periodic images along the z-direction, and dipole corrections were applied. A quasi-Newton algorithm was used for relaxation. The lattice constant of Cu is calculated to be 3.63 Å, which is only 0.3% overestimated compared with the experimental value (3.62 Å) [57]. A 3 × 3 × 1 γ centered Monkhorst-Pack kpoint mesh was used to sample the Brillouin zone for the Al@Cu(111) and pristine Cu(111) surfaces, whereas only the γ point was sampled for the molecular calculations and higher 7 × 7 × 1 for the projected density of states (pDOS) calculations [58]. The transition states (TS) were calculated with the climbing-image nudged elastic band method [59,60], and the partial atomic charges were calculated by Bader charge analysis [61]. The computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) method was applied in free energy diagrams, which assumes a half of the free energy of gaseous hydrogen equivalent to the free energy of proton-electron pair at 0 V, all pH values, and 1 atm. Thus, the energy of H2(g) is used as an electrochemical reference [62]. The adsorption energies (E ad) of the CO2RR intermediates were obtained by the following equation: E a d = G t o t a l − G s l a b − − G a d s o r b a t e r In which, the G total, G slab and G adsorbater represent the free energies of the species adsorbed slab system, clean slab, and the absorbate, respectively. According to this definition, a more negative adsorption energy indicates a stronger adsorption. The Gibbs free energy (ΔG) was corrected at 298 K and 100 kPa [63] by the VASPKIT program [64] as follows Δ G = E D F T + Δ Z P E − T S Δ Z P E = ∑ i 1 2 h v i where h is the Planck constant, v i is the computed real frequencies of the system, and EDFT is the calculated total energy. The total entropy (S) is obtained from Ref. [65]. The frequencies of the optimized adsorption species at γ point are determined by VASP and the convergence accuracy is improved. While calculating the frequencies of adsorbates, all the Cu atomic layers are fixed and only the adsorbates and Al atoms are released. All the optimal structures except the transition states are stable and have no imaginary frequencies. For the free energy correction of the adsorbed species, VASPKIT attributes the translational or rotational part of the contribution to vibration; in other words, the 3N vibrations of the surface-adsorbing molecules (except the virtual frequency) are all used to calculate the correction of the thermal energy. 3 Results and discussions 3.1 Dissociated adsorption Adsorption of CO2 on the catalyst surface via covalent bonds would result in electron transfer from the surface or the adsorbed CO2, which generates a key intermediate *CO2 with a radical or a cation feature. Introduction of the Al atom into the Cu(111) surface to tune the atomic charge distributions of the catalyst surface may form several possible site for adsorption of CO2. The charge transfer between Cu and Al may be a key factor for feature of the adsorption sites and can be roughly estimated by using electronegativities of atom, in which the electronegativities of Cu and Al atoms are reported to be 4.48 and 3.23, respectively. Such results support an electron transfer from Al to Cu atoms. In order to check the simple prediction by using electronegativity, Bader charge analysis was carried out for our studied system. The results indicate that the charge of the six Cu atoms around the Al center in the surface is calculated to be in the range from 0.14 to 0.17 (see Fig. 1 a). By contrast, the Bader charge of the Cu atoms on the surface, which does not directly attach to the Al center, is calculated to be roughly zero. As expect, the Bader charge of the Al atom is calculated to be −1.16. These results indicate that a significant electron transfer from the Al center to the six Cu atoms in the surface. Such results indicate that the Al center and adjacent six surface Cu atoms should be descripted as Alδ+- (Cu6)δ−. By contrast, the CO2 molecule are formed by two polar C=O bonds with linear structure, and thus always descripted as Oδ−=Cδ+=Oδ− configuration. The strong electrostatic interaction between polar Oδ−=Cδ+ bond in CO2 molecule and Alδ+-(Cu6)δ- in the Al/Cu(111) surface indicates that the Al center and its adjacent Cu atoms may have the potential for adsorption of inert CO2 molecule with an unique double-site configuration (see Fig. 1c). We are well-known that the ionic radius of Al3+ is significantly smaller than that of neutral Al atom (0.050 vs. 0.143 nm). Such electronic configuration of the Alδ+ center would lead to the reduction of atomic radius. In addition, the atomic radius of neutral Al atom is larger than that of the neutral Cu atom (0.143 vs. 0.128 nm). Thus, such electron transfer process would narrow the gap of atomic radius between Al and Cu atoms in the Al/Cu(111) surface. The analogous atomic radius of Cu and Al atoms would be favorable to interaction of metal atoms when compared to metal atoms with significant difference on atomic radius. Such results are well in agreement with our optimization calculations, in which the Al atom was inserted into the Cu matrix via six Al-Cu bonds with roughly same distance in the first layer, and thus a good stability (see Fig. 1b). The linear CO2 molecule in its ground state is inert and resistant to reactivity. Transferring extra electrons to CO2 molecule to form a bent structure is always a key step for further electroreduction reaction. In the present paper, various adsorption configurations of CO2 on Al/Cu(111) surface have been considered based on our DFT calculations, the most stable species have been shown in Fig. 1a. In line with electronic structural analysis, CO2 molecule with Oδ−=Cδ+=Oδ− configuration should be adsorbed on the Al/Cu(111) surface via an interaction of polar Oδ−=Cδ+ bond and Alδ+- Cuδ− unit induced by an electrostatic force. Our optimization calculations well reproduced such trend, in which the CO2 molecule was adsorbed to the Al/Cu(111) surface via formation of Al-O and Cu-C bonds with lengths of 1.848 and 2.044 Å, respectively. Meanwhile, the such adsorption configuration leads to a bent CO2 molecule with a bond angle of 113°. Previous literatures showed that bent CO2 adsorption was unstable than linear CO2 adsorption because the bent CO2 structure is very strain [66]. The adsorption energy of bent CO2 adsorbed on Al/Cu(111) surface is calculated to be 0.22 eV, which is consistent with the result for adsorption of CO2 on a Ni(111) surface (0.22 vs. 0.22 eV) [67]. Such result indicates that Al/Cu(111) surface is associated with a mildly endothermic CO2 adsorption, which can be readily overcome under an applied reducing potential for electroreduction of CO2 to ethanol. The Bader charge analysis shows that the bent CO2 unit has negative charges near −0.84 over the Al/Cu(111) surface relevant to the neutral CO2 molecule. By contrast, in the most stable adsorption configuration the Bader charge of the Al center is calculated to be about +1.62, and the Bader charge of Cu atoms around the Al center are calculated to be in the range from 0.04 to 0.19. Compared with the Bader charge of the Al center and Cu atoms around the Al center in clean Al/Cu(111) surface (+1.16 and in the range of −0.14 and −0.17), it is evident enough to show that a significant electron transfer from the Al center to the adsorbed CO2 molecule, and the adjacent Cu atoms in Al/Cu(111) surface act as an electron-transfer medium. Such electron transferring process leads to the length of C-O bond increases from 1.177 in free CO2 molecule to 1.208 and 1.320 Å in bent CO2 molecule. Meanwhile, our DFT calculations show that the Bader charges of two O atoms changes from 1.06 in free CO2 molecule to 1.05 and 1.23 in bent CO2 molecule. Such results indicate that the O atom attached to the Al center accept more electrons when compared with another one. Owing to very strong oxophilic ability of Al atom and the activated CO2 molecule, we firstly consider that the adsorbed CO2 molecule could be reduced to CO via a dissociated adsorption process firstly [68]. The calculated free energy profile for dissociation of CO2 to CO and an active oxygen atom has been shown in Fig. 2 a. It can be found that the bent CO2 molecule dissociated over the Al/Cu(111) surface via a transition state TS1, which needs a free energy barrier of 0.42 eV with an imaginary frequency of –341.40 cm–1. At TS1, the Cu(111)/AlO···CO distance increases from 1.320 Å in *CO2 to 1.764 Å in TS1. The Cu(111)/AlOC···O distance decreases from 1.208 Å in *CO2 to 1.173 Å in TS1. The Cu(111)/Al···OCO distance decreases from 1.848 Å to 1.782 Å. Such results strongly suggested that the Cu(111)/AlO···CO bond dissociated to form a new CO molecule and then the left an oxygen atom absorbed by the oxophilic Al atom. After across TS1, the Cu(111)/AlO···CO distance increases from 1.764 Å in TS1 to 3.217 Å in *CO+*O, and the Cu(111)/AlOC···O distance decreases from 1.173 Å in TS1 to 1.169 Å in *CO+*O, indicating complete cleavage of Cu(111)/AlO···CO bond to from an CO molecule adsorbed on the top site of Cu atom on the Al/Cu(111) surface. And the left O atom dropped into the 3-fold hollow site formed by two Cu atoms and one Al atom. The calculated relative energy show that this dissociated adsorption process is exoergic by 0.14 eV, indicating a potential thermodynamic driving force. By contrast, the reduction of CO2 to CO via electrochemical approach is a high-energy path when compared with the dissociated adsorption process (see Fig. 2b), in which the calculated the free energy curve of the electrochemical path locates in the upper, indicating the electrochemical approach (red color) is not thermodynamic favorable. Due to the very high reactivity, the *O atom can be reduced to H2O via electrochemical path. As shown in Fig. 2b, the calculated reaction free energy for the first hydrogenation of the *O atom is exoergic by 0.21 eV, indicating that *CO+*OH intermediate is a thermodynamically stable species. The Cu(111)/Al···O distance increases from 1.753 Å in *CO+*O to 1.803 Å in *CO+*OH in this step. For the second hydrogenation step, the calculated reaction free energy indicates that this step is endergonic by 0.23 eV, indicating that this step is thermodynamically unfavorable. However, the consumed energy in this step can be entirely compensated by the reaction energy for reduction of *CO2 to *CO+*OH via dissociated adsorption of CO2. As with the formation of a H2O molecule over the Al/Cu(111) surface, the Cu(111)/Al···O distance increases from 1.803 Å in *CO+*OH to 2.106 Å in *CO+*H2O in this step. Subsequently, desorption of H2O molecule from the Al/Cu(111) surface to form *CO is calculated to be exoergic by 0.14 eV. All these results indicate that the most favorable path for reduction of CO2 to CO over the Al/Cu(111) surface is a combined process of disassociated adsorption and electrochemical reduction. According to previous studies, binding of CO molecule on the catalyst surface is a prerequisite for generation of C2+ production via CO dimerization step in CO2RR [69,70]. Thus, we considered the desorption behavior of the new formed CO over the Al/Cu(111) surface. As shown in Fig. 2b, the calculated desorption energy of 0.56 eV indicates the CO molecule can be bound on the Al/Cu(111) surface with considerable adsorption energy. The exceptionally large energy for desorption of CO from the Al/Cu(111) surface indicates that it would remain on the surface sufficiently long to possibly undergo further CO dimerization. The free energy profiles about reduction of CO2 to CO over the Cu(111) surface also have been compared in Fig. 2, which are calculated at the same level in this work. It can be found that the thermodynamic energy barrier about reduction CO2 to COOH is much higher than that of dissociated adsorption pathway over the Al/Cu(111) surface. Thus, the presence of the Al atom on the Cu(111) surface can reduce effectively thermodynamic energy barrier when reduction of CO2 to CO. 3.2 CO dimerization In the present paper, the direct coupling of two CO molecules was examined by using our DFT calculations. The calculated free energy profiles of CO dimerization were shown in Fig. 3 . It can be found that two CO molecules adsorbed on the Al/Cu(111) surface approach each other to form *OCCO via a transition state TS2, which undergoes a free energy barrier of 0.86 eV with an imaginary frequency of 182.51 cm−1. The calculated relative energy show that the reaction free energy for this CO dimerization is 0.19 eV. We also calculated the free energy profile for CO dimerization over the Cu(111) surface at the same levels (see Fig. S14). The result indicates that the calculated free energy barrier and reaction energy about CO dimerization over the Cu(111) surface (1.81 eV and 1.53 eV, respectively) are both higher than that of CO dimerization on the Al/Cu(111) surface. Thus, introduction of Al atom into the Cu(111) surface is both thermodynamically and kinetically favorable for the reaction of CO dimerization. Our optimization calculations show that two CO molecules were adsorbed on a 3-fold hollow site formed by three Cu atoms and a top site of Al atom, respectively. The distance of two CO molecule is optimized to be 3.336 Å in the *CO+*CO intermediate. In TS2, the CO molecule adsorbed on the top site of Al atom goes across the Al atom to approach another CO molecule and results in two titled CO molecules on the Al/Cu(111) surface. And the distance of two CO molecules is calculated to be 1.629 Å. The O atom of the tilted CO molecule in TS2 approaches to the Al atom with 2.493 Å. After across TS2, the distance of two CO molecules decreases to 1.342 Å, indicating the complete formation of OC-CO bond. Meanwhile, the Cu(111)/Al···OCCO distance in *OCCO intermediate decreases to 1.796 Å. If we focus on the migration CO molecule, it could be found that an erected CO molecule was lay the Al/Cu(111) surface assisted by the oxophilic Al atom step by step. Such process leads to a unique molecular geometry of OCCO fragment in *OCCO intermediate, in which OCCO is bonded on the two top sites of the Cu and Al atoms through a C atom and an O atom of OCCO unit, respectively. According to our Bader charge analysis, the conversion from *CO+*CO to TS2 results in an electron transfer process from the C1 atom to the Al center mediated by the Cu1 atom, as supported by an increase of Bader charge on Al center from −1.51 to −1.30, and a decrease of Bader charge on the C1 atom from −0.63 and −0.82. Such result is mainly due to the cleavage of the Cu1-C1 bond, in which the Cu1-C1 distance increases from 2.070 to 2.916 Å in this conversion. While, the conversion from TS2 to *OCCO leads to strong electrons accumulation on C1 and C2 atoms. The cleavage of Cu2-C1 bond generates electron accumulations on Cu2 and C1 atoms, simultaneously. And the formation of C1-C2 bond gives rise to an electron transfer from Al center to the C2 atom mediated by an O atom. Such result leads to an increase of Bader charge on the C1 atom from −0.82 to −0.76. And an increase of Bader charge on the C2 atom from −0.61 to −0.40. All these results indicate that the Al center acts as a medium for the electron transfer in the coupling of two CO molecules over Al/Cu(111) surface, in which the Al center acts as an electron acceptor in the conversion from *CO+*CO to TS2, and plays the role of electron donor in the conversion from TS2 to *OCCO. As shown in Fig. 3, *OCCO is not a thermodynamically stable species. Owing to the strong oxophilic property of Al center, the cleavage of OCC···OAl/Cu(111) bond has been considered to convert the high-energy *OCCO into *CCO+*O intermediate. This process needs to undergo a transition state TS3 with a free energy barrier of 1.02 eV. Our frequency calculations confirm that TS3 has an imaginary frequency of −380.78 cm−1 with the rational vibration mode corresponding to the intrinsic reaction coordination. In TS3, the OC1C2···OAl/Cu(111) distance increases from 1.394 to 1.830 Å, indicating a strong splitting trend. Meanwhile, the O(C2)C1···OAl/Cu(111) distance increases to 1.742 Å, which results in the formation of a three-membered-ring arrangement (C1C2O2) in TS3. As the formation of *CCO+*O intermediate, the OCC···OAl/Cu(111) distance increases to 4.080 Å, and the OCCO···Al/Cu(111) distance decrease to 1.747 Å, indicating the completed disassociation of OCC···OAl/Cu(111) bond and the formation of O-Al/Cu(111) bond. The two dissociated fragments both fall into two 3-fold hollow sites in *CCO+*O intermediate. The relative energy of *CCO+*O intermediate is calculate to be −0.58 eV, indicating *CCO+*O is a thermodynamically stable species on the free energy profile. According to our Bader charge analysis, the conversion of *OCCO to *CCO+*O leads to a strong electron accumulation on the C2 atom, as supported by an increase of Bader charge on C2 atom from −0.40 in *OCCO to 0.21 in *CCO+*O. Such result indicates that the C2 atom is an electron-rich site in *CCO+*O intermediate, which has the potential to react with the proton in the following electrochemical process. 3.3 Reduction of CO dimmer to ethanol We would show that introduction of oxophilic Al atom into the Cu(111) surface effectively improves the selectivity toward ethanol with low prepotentials. The calculated free energy profile for electroreduction of CO dimerization to ethanol have been listed in Fig. 4 . It can be found that the remaining *O atom on the Al/Cu(111) surface was firstly reduced to H2O molecule. For the first hydrogenation of the *O atom, the calculated reaction energy is found to be exoergic by 0.37 eV. This result indicates that *CCO+*OH intermediate is thermodynamic stable species, which would remain on the surface sufficiently long to be further reduced to H2O. The following reducing step is calculated to be endergonic by 0.25 eV to form a new H2O molecule in *CCO+*H2O intermediate. And desorption of new formed H2O molecule from the Al/Cu(111) surface is found to be exoergic by 0.54 eV, indicating *CCO is a thermodynamic stable species. By contrast, hydrogenation of *CCO unit of *CCO+*O intermediate, rather than *O, is a high-energy path according to our mechanism investigation (see Fig. 4, black color). For the *CCO intermediate, all possible hydrogenation sites have been considered and the structures have been optimized in this work. We found that *CHCO intermediate is the most stable structure. The electron-rich C atom adsorbed on the Al/Cu(111) surface has the good potential to react with the proton when compared with others in *CCO intermediate. This step is calculated to be exoergic by 0.03 eV. This result indicates that hydrogenation of *CCO to *CHCO is nearly thermoneutral. In the following two reducing steps, the *CHCO intermediate was reduced to *CH2CHO via *CHCHO. And both steps are calculated be exoergic (0.81 and 0.28 eV). The O atom in CCO unit was not hydrogenated in these steps because it was adsorbed by the oxophilic Al center to form an Al-O bond with length of 1.831 and 1.822 Å in *CHCHO and *CH2CHO intermediates, respectively. Such structural arrangement results in a unique hydrogenation path, in which hydrogenation of *CCO to *CCOH or hydrogenation of *CHCO to *CHCOH are both thermodynamically unfavorable because of the existence of Al-O bond. Thus, introduction of oxophilic Al atom into the Cu(111) surface improves the selectivity of ethanol product because the O atom of CCO unit cannot be removed to form ethylene or ethane products. The subsequent reduction step is found to be endergonic by 0.18 eV and forms a CH3CHO* intermediate with an Al-O bond length of 1.823 Å. The next step is predicted to be most exoergic among all reaction steps. As shown in Fig. 4, hydrogenation of CH3CHO* to CH3CH2O* is found to be strongly exoergic by 1.02 eV. This result indicates that CH3CH2O* intermediate would possess a high surface concentration and remain on the surface sufficiently long to be further reduced to CH3CH2OH* because it is the most thermodynamic stable species on the whole free energy profile. Meanwhile, we note that the Al-O bond was elongated from 1.823 Å in CH3CHO* to 1.835 Å in CH3CH2O*. Owing to the strong oxophilic property of the Al center, hydrogenation of CH3CH2O* to CH3CH2OH* is calculated to be endergonic by 0.39 eV. And the Al-O distance was elongated from 1.835 Å in CH3CH2O* to 2.034 Å in CH3CH2OH*, indicating hydrogenation of O atom in CH3CH2O* intermediate results in the cleavage of the Al-O bond. Finally, desorption of an ethanol molecule from the Al/Cu(111) surface leads to replenishment of the catalyst, which is calculated to be exoergic by 0.1 eV, indicating that desorption of ethanol molecule is thermodynamically allowed. 4 Conclusion We have provided a fundamental understanding of the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to ethanol on an Al/Cu(111) surface based on our periodic DFT calculations. Our focus has been placed on the active sites accounting for the high activity and selectivity of the Cu-Al electrocatalyst, particularly it derived from inexpensive and convenient metals. By using state-of-the-art electronic structure techniques, we conclude that introduction of Al atom into the Cu(111) surface results in the formation of a Alδ+-(Cu6)δ− configuration on the surface of this Cu-based electrocatalyst. This is mainly due to the different on the electronegativities of Cu and Al atoms. Owing to very strong oxophilic ability of Al atom, the adsorbed CO2 molecule was reduced to CO via a unique dissociated adsorption process. According to our free energy calculations, introduction of Al atom into the Cu(111) surface is both thermodynamically and kinetically favorable for the reaction of CO dimerization when compared with the pristine Cu(111) surface. The electronic structure analysis shows that the Al center acts as a medium for the electron transfer in the coupling of two CO molecules over Al/Cu(111) surface. Owing to the *OCCO dimer is not a thermodynamically stable species, it easily converts into the *CCO+*O intermediate via a dissociated adsorption process induced by the strong oxophilic Al atom. Finally, our mechanism investigation shows that the presence of oxophilic Al atom into the Cu(111) surface improves the selectivity of ethanol product because of the existence of the Al-O bond in some key intermediates. All these results indicate that the contributions of the oxophilic Al atom in the Cu(111) surface for improving the electrocatalytic performance in CO2RR can be summarized as (i) formation of a Alδ+- (Cu6)δ− configuration on the Al/Cu(111) surface, (ii) the presence of the free-atom-like Al 2px and 2py states, (iii) inducing the unique dissociated adsorption process, and (iv) improving the selectivity of ethanol via formation of the Al-O bond along the hydrogenation path.

        "dc:description": "Inspired by the work of Sargent et al. (Nature, 2020, 581, 178–183), the oxophilic Al atom was introduced into the Cu(111) surface to design a Al/Cu(111) bimetallic catalysts for implementing electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction based on the first-principles calculations. The results indicate that introduction of the oxophilic Al atom into the Cu(111) surface effectively improves the CO2 adsorption ability via formation of a Alδ+- (Cu6)δ− configuration on the Al/Cu(111) surface. And the adsorbed CO2 was easily reduced to CO via a unique dissociated adsorption process induced by the oxophilic Al center. Our energy calculations show that introduction of the Al atom into the Cu(111) surface is both thermodynamically and kinetically favorable for CO dimerization when compared with the pristine Cu(111) surface. And the Al center acts as an electron-transfer medium for the coupling of two CO molecules over Al/Cu(111) surface. Finally, our mechanism investigation shows that the presence of oxophilic Al atom in the Cu(111) surface effectively improves the selectivity of ethanol product via the formation of the Al-O bond along the hydrogenation path.",
