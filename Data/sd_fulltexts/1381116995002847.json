France Received 29 Vhy E995; accepted 16 October 1995 Abstract Efficient epoxidation of natural terpenic olefins is performed using nickel acetylacelonate, oxygen and a branched aldehyde at ambient temperature. Total conversions are achieved with selectivities up to 90% into epoxide. Under the same conditions other catalytic systems using transition metal acetylacetonates (M\"(acac)^) have been used, some of which also gave satisfactory results.

Introduction Essential oils of pine trees that generally contain more than 80% of terpenic olefins, is an extremely useful source of starting material for several high value industrial processes used for the synthesis of fragrances and pharmaceutical compounds. A new route to high added value compounds from these natural products is therefore a chal- lenge, among which catalytic functional ization of olefins is probably of major interest. In par- ticular, the olefin epoxidation catalyzed by tran- sition metal salts [V, Mo, Fe, Ti, etc.] in the presence of an oxidant (H^Oy, tBuOOH, Corresponding author. peracids, PhIO, etc.) has been performed selec- tively and sometimes with a high degree of enantioselectivity. Recently, Mukaiyama et al. [1] have de- scribed a very simple catalytic combination [NKacac^/RCHO/O;,) which allows the syn- thesis of epoxide under mild conditions (1 atm O^, ambient temperature). The ligand structure (1,3 diketones) and that of the aldehyde have been studied, in an effort to determine the best catalytic combination in terms of activity and selectivity [1,2]. Other transition metal based catalysts have also been reported to exhibit high activities for cyclic olefins epoxidation (Ni sup- ported catalyst [3], Ru salts [4] cobalt Schiffs base complexes [5]). In connection with our on going interest in catalytic functionalization of terpenic olefins [6], 1381-1169/96/S15.00 ro 1996 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved SSDl 1381-1169(95)00284-7 16 /V. Fcii! ft ul. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 108 (1996) 15-21 we report here some data obtained in their epoxidation under oxygen using metal acety- lacetonates complexes and isobutyraldehyde as reductant. 2. Results and discussion The olefins are epoxidized in a 1,2-dichloro- ethane solution of isobutyraldehyde and the cat- alytic complex [M\"(acac)J, by a continuous bubbling of molecular dioxygen. Samples of catalytic solution are taken from time to time and analyzed by GC. 2.1. Epoxidation of different terpenic olefins Various terpenic olefins have been epoxi- dized in an effort to look at the chemo- and stereoselectivity of these reactions, using nickel(II) acetylacetonate as standard catalyst (see Table 1). Upon using (+ )-o'-pinene as substrate (Scheme 1) a total conversion is observed within 30 min, with a 93% selectivity into epoxide; both stereoisomers (as and trans) are obtained, in a 94/6 ratio. The major isomer is the truns form, as deduced from high field NMR studies [7]. With (5)-(-limomene, again a 100% con- version is obtained with a chemoselectivity into monoepoxide of 81% (trans/cis = 60/40) [4].

As determined by GC-MS spectroscopy, some diepoxidation was also observed (17%) with predominantly the trans isomer (trans/'cis = 1.6/1). (+ )-Car-3-ene is much less reactive than the above isomers, as a 97% conversion is only reached after 5 h. The trans isomer is only obtained; its stereochemistry (see Scheme 1) was determined after purification and NMR No. Substrate Reac (h) lion lime Conversion(%) Epoxide selectivilics(%) /fWl.S/ClA- 1 ( + )-o'-pinene 0.5 100 93 94/6 2 (S)-( - )-limonene 2.5 100 81 \" 60/40 3 (+ )-car-3-ene 2.5 97 90 96/4 4 (+ )-car-2-ene 5 96 89 100/0 5 (+ )-/?-menlh-l-ene 1.5 90 90 60/40 6 ( - )-pw;.'>-isolinionene 6 ](>() 91 100/0 7 (S)-/3-citronellol 4 90 86 C 8 (R}-( - )-carvone 36 100 70 Conditions: 1,2-dichloroethane = 5 ml, Ni(acac), = 0.16 mmol. isobutyraldehyde = 24 mmol, olcfin = 8 mmol.

Fail et al./Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 108 (1996) 15-21 17 analyses from a comparison of the latter with literature data using the chemical shift differ- ence between the gem dimethyl groups [7]. The internal double bond of (+ )-menth-1 -ene reacts with a 90% selectivity to gives the corre- sponding epoxide with a 60/40 trans/cis ratio similar to that observed with limonene, whereas (+ )-frans-iso\\mowne arising from the isomeri- sation of (+ )-car-2-ene [8] gives a conversion of 100% in 6 h with a 91% selectivity. Finally (/?)-(-carv one, which presents the same structure as limonene but with a carbonyl group in an a position to the endocyclic double bond has very poor reactivity, as 36 h are necessary for the reaction to go to completion. 2.2. Catalytic system: role of the metal and of the ligand Nobile et al. have achieved the efficient epoxidation of cyclic olefins with (3-keto- esterate complexes of iron(III), nickel(II) and cobalt(II) [2]. Epoxidation of some terpenic olefins have also been reported with cobalt(II) Schiff's base complexes [5] and with supported nickel catalyst [3]. Attempts carry out the epoxidation of (+ )- a-pinene have been made in an effort to see whether this catalytic reaction could be per- foi-med efficiently with other transition metal acetylacetonates (Table 2). Cu, Cr, Pd and Rh acetylacetonaies are al- most inactive, whereas Mo, V and Zr complexes show moderate activities and epoxide selectivi- ties. It is clear that first row transition metal elements are much more suitable, particularly cobalt, manganese and nickel. Furthermore, to determine whether acetylace- tonate ligands play a role during the epoxidation elementary step, we have synthesized chiral (3- diketones from camphor according to a proce- dure already described by Togni [9] and the corresponding nickel and manganese complexes (Scheme 2). These complexes have been tested in the epoxidation of (5)-(-)-limomene and (3- Table 2 Catalytic epoxic lation of (+ )-pinene on dif 'ferent acetylaceto- nate complexes a Catalyst Reaction Conversion Epoxide time (h) (%) selectivity (%) Cutacac)^ 5 0 - Ci<acac)i 8 0 - Rh(acac), 6 0 - PdCacac)^ 7 12 0 ZKacac),, 5 53 20 VCXacac), 7 60 21 MoO^acac); 7.5 48 44 Co(acac), 1 9)5 93 Co(acac); 3 97 9) Fe(acac)j 4 99 89 Mn(acac), ! 100 93 NKacac); 0.5 100 93 a Conditions: same as in Table 1. citronellol, this last substrate gives diastereoiso- mers easily separated by GC (Scheme 1). As already mentioned by Mukaiyama, substi- tution of diketonato ligand by electrodonating groups enhances the activity. But with limonene the cis/trans ratio of mono or diepoxide ob- tained with complexes 1, 2 and 3 is almos^ the same as that observed in experiments carried out with NKacac)^. In the same way Table 3 shows that the epoxidation of /3-citronellol leads to an enan- tiomeric excess close to zero whatever the lig- and or metal used. 2.3.

At ambi- ent temperature (20-250C) this oxidation does not occur in the absence of metallic catalyst. However at higher temperature (up to 45-50) the formation of peracid and therefore subse- quent epoxidation of olefin is observed without catalyst, as recently reported with other olefins [12]. This fact suggests that epoxidation occurs by reaction of peracid initially formed with the olefin according to the Prilezaev reaction [13]. For this step two different pathways (A and B, Scheme 3) can be proposed: (i) In path A die Prilezaev reaction is catal- ysed by a transition metal moiety. In this pro- cess the peracid reacts with a metallic species to give an oxometalate complex which oxidizes the olefin into epoxide [14] and regenerates the initial catalytic species. (ii) The peracid can also directly react with the olefin to produce the epoxide (path B). The observation that chiral ligands have prac- tically no influence on the stereoselectivity of the reaction, could indicate that path B in which the chiral catalytic complex does not intervene in the last step of the epoxidation, is the most probable. However, it is also conceivable that the chiral ligands are not able to give asymmet- ric induction '. 3. Conclusion The functionalization of different natural ter- penic olefins such as a-pinene, limonene, etc. into the corresponding epoxide can be carried out under very mild conditions and in high yield by using a simple catalytic system consisting of a transition metal complex (Ni, Fe, Co, Mn) with jS-diketono Sigands, branched aldehyde and molecular oxygen. Unfortunately, the replace- ment of classical acetylacetonate by chiral (3-d'i- ketones derived from camphor did not result in the enantioselective epoxidation of prochiral olefLs. 4.

In order to verify these assumptions, isobutyraldehydc (24 mmol) in a solution in dichloroethane (15 ml) was oxidized in the absence of metallic catalyst by heating at 55 ibr 3 h. Then the mixture was cooled at ambient temperature and a-pincne (8 mmol) was added. Analyses of the periodic samples have shown that a-pinene was efficiently epoxidized in these conditions whereas, as ah'eady mentioned, there is no reaction without initial heating. However the rate of epoxidation under these conditions was much lower (25 and 52% conversion for / = 1 and 5 h, respectively) than that observed w metal catalyst (see Table 1. entry 1). Therefore it is aLo possible thai 'he two pathways A and B occur simultaneously. ,V.

Efficient epoxidation of natural terpenic olefins is performed using nickel acetylacetonate, oxygen and a branched aldehyde at ambient temperature. Total conversions are achieved with selectivities up to 90% into epoxide. Under the same conditions other catalytic systems using transition metal acetylacetonates (M n (acac) n ) have been used, some of which also gave satisfactory results.
