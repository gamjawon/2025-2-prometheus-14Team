STEVENSON* and J. A. DUMESIC** Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 (U.S.A.) (Received June 28, 1988; accepted September 8, 1988) Summary The effects of the exposure to carbon monoxide of small metallic iron particles supported on carbon black, alumina and graphite were studied. The alumina- and graphite-supported samples adsorbed amounts of CO consistent with the metallic iron surface areas estimated by magnetic susceptibility. The carbon black-supported samples, however, adsorbed large amounts of CO, in some cases an average of more than three molecules per iron atom. Moss- bauer spectroscopy showed that iron pentacarbonyl was formed. The forma- tion of Fe(CO)s is thought to require small, coordinatively unsaturated iron particles. Introduction Over the course of the last decade, it has become clear that a catalyst support is not always an inert carrier, but can have a profound effect on the properties of supported metals (e.g. [1-5]). One material that shows an especially wide variety of support effects is carbon. Earlier studies have demonstrated that carbon supports may influence the morphological [6 - II], adsorptive [12-15] and reactive properties [16-22] of supported metal particles. Our work in this area has focused on the role of the support in the behavior of highly-dispersed alumina- and carbon-supported metallic iron catalysts prepared from triiron dodecacarbonyl. In a separate publication [23] we discussed the effects of the support on the iron particle size, particle separation and particle morphology in these catalysts. In brief, a strong inter- action between the cluster and the alumina and carbon black supports during impregnation led to metallic dispersions of higher than 60%, with a signif- icant fraction of the iron present in particles containing only a few iron *Present address: Institut fur Physikalische Chemie der Universitat Miinchen, Sophienstrasse 11, 8000 Munich 2, F.R.G. **Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 388 atoms. While some very small metallic iron particles were also obtained on a similarly prepared graphite-supported catalyst and on a carbon black- supported catalyst prepared by impregnation with ferric nitrate, the average particle size was much larger. In addition, Mossbauer spectroscopy measure- ments indicated that the resulting iron particles in the latter two catalysts were less spherical in shape and possibly more closely spaced than those in the cluster-derived carbon black-supported catalyst. The work discussed in the present paper will demonstrate that these differences in size, mor- phology, and/or support interactions have significant consequences for the adsorptive properties of these catalysts. In a separate paper [24] we report the catalytic properties of these materials for ethane hydrogenolysis. Experimental Sample preparation Four samples were investigated in this study: 0.95 wt.% Fe/carbon black (Cabot CSX-203,1400 m2 g~1), prepared by impregnation using triiron dodecacarbonyl, Fe3(CO)i2; 0.36 wt.% Fe/graphite (Ultra Carbon UCP-1- 200, 3 m2 g~1) prepared by incipient wetness impregnation using Fe3(CO)i2; 0.36 wt.% Fe/Al20 3 (American Cyanamid, 172 m2 g~1) prepared by wet impregnation using Fe3(CO)i2; and 4.67 wt.% Fe/carbon black (Cabot CSX- 203) prepared by aqueous incipient wetness using ferric nitrate. All cluster- derived samples were prepared in a water- and oxygen-free atmosphere inside a Vacuum Atmospheres glove box system. The details of preparation and handling have been reported elsewhere [23]. Carbon monoxide chemisorption Carbon monoxide chemisorption measurements were performed in a glass apparatus capable of achieving a dynamic vacuum of ca. 10~4 Pa. Measurements were performed at room temperature; physical adsorption was accounted for by collection of a desorption isotherm. Pressure measurements were made with a Texas Instruments precision pressure gauge. Hydrogen (Airco, 99.995%) used for reduction was purified by a Serfass Pd Thimble. Carbon monoxide (Matheson, 99.9%) was passed over copper turnings maintained at approximately 523 K to remove iron penta- carbonyl; subsequently, the gas was passed over molecular sieve beads main- tained at 195 K to remove water. All samples were brought from the glove box to the adsorption apparatus under vacuum without exposure to air. Mossbauer spectroscopy measurements Prior to collection of Mossbauer spectra, samples were pretreated in the glass chemisorption apparatus described above. The samples were then sealed in a Lexan Mossbauer spectroscopy cell without exposure to air [25]. This cell was placed in an Air Products cooling system, allowing temperatures of 79 K to be attained. During collection of the spectra, the region around the sample cell was maintained at a pressure of approximately 10 Pa. 389 Spectra were collected using an Austin Sciences Spectrometer. The source consisted of 50 mCi of \"Co diffused into a Pd matrix. Doppler veloci- ties were calibrated with a 6 jum metallic iron foil and a sodium nitroprusside standard. Isomer shifts were reported relative to metallic iron at room tem- perature. Spectra were computer analyzed using a modified version of the program MFIT [26]. Results CO chemisorption Carbon monoxide chemisorption results are presented in Table 1. Metallic iron dispersions estimated by magnetic susceptibility [23] are also reported in this table. As discussed elsewhere [23], the uptakes for the graphite- and alumina-supported samples are consistent with particle size estimates obtained from magnetic susceptibility, if an adsorption stoichiometry of one CO molecule per two surface iron atoms is assumed [27]. The CO adsorbed on all of these samples could be desorbed at approx- imately 373 K in vacuum, and an equivalent amount of CO could then be readsorbed. TABLE 1 Carbon monoxide uptakes for supported metallic iron catalysts Sample ^reduction CO/Fe Metallic iron dispersion (K) Fe/graphite 673 0.16 0.38 Fe/alumina 773 0.26 0.64 Fe/carbon black 673 2.6 0.68 (iron carbonyl) 773 3.3 0.62 Fe/carbon black 673 0.94 0.41 (ferric nitrate) In contrast, the CO uptakes of the carbon black-supported samples are too large to be accounted for by the expected adsorption stoichiometry. Measurements with the blank carbon black demonstrated that these large uptakes cannot be due to adsorption on the support. The adsorbed CO could be quantitatively desorbed at 400 K in vacuum; subsequent room-temper- ature readsorption of CO gave uptakes that were within 20% of the original adsorption values. Not only was the extent of CO adsorption on the carbon black- supported samples greater than that of the graphite- and alumina-supported catalysts, but the time required to reach equilibrium at a given CO pressure was longer. On the graphite- and alumina-supported samples adsorption was essentially complete after 30 min; most of the adsorption occurred within 390 151 8 o-i . 1 . , . 1 . 1 0 20 40 60 80 Tune(min) Fig. 1.

Representative data, from the sam- ple prepared by impregnation with Fe3(CO)i2 and reduced at 673 K, are shown in Fig. 2. Mossbauer spectroscopy measurements Mossbauer spectra collected of the Fe/graphite sample are shown in Fig. 3; spectral parameters estimated by computer fitting are presented in Table 2. Figure 3A is the spectrum of the sample following reduction at 673 K. The four major peaks present are the innermost four peaks of a ferro- magnetic iron sextuplet, indicative of large metallic iron particles. Close examination also reveals the presence of a feature near zero velocity, which may be attributed to the presence of small superparamagnetic metallic iron particles. Exposure of a sample reduced at 673 K to 33 kPa of CO for 12 h resulted in the spectrum shown in Fig. 3B. This spectrum also indicates the presence of both large ferromagnetic iron particles as well as small super- paramagnetic particles. As can be seen from Table 2, the iron spectral parameters are changed little by exposure to CO. 391 TABLE 2 Mossbauer spectroscopy parameters of carbon-supported metallic iron Sample Treatment Figure T Species\" 8 A H Relative (K) (mm s-1) (mm s-') (kOe) spectral area (%) Fe/graphite 673 K, H, 3A 79 Fe Fe (s) -0.003 -0.043 0.105 339.81 937 673 K, H, overnight 3B 79 Fe Fe (s) 0.078 -0.139 -0.020 338.40 928 in CO Fe/carbon black 773 K, Hz 4A 79 Fe (s) Fe^ 0.144 1.807 1.578 78 22 (cluster-derived) 773 K,H, overnight 4B 79 a-Fe10 b-Fe -0.002 0.658 42 33 in CO Fe(CO)s 0.098 2.405 25 \"(s) denotes superparamagnetic species. -5.0 -2.5 0.0 2.5 5.0 Velocity (nun/s) Fig. 3.

A small shoulder near 2 mm s~1 can also be seen. This peak is part of a doublet indicative of ferrous cations and is probably due to a small amount of contamination by oxygen during sample handling. Figure 4B shows a spectrum collected after exposing this sample to 33 kPa of CO for 12 h. The following three peaks are apparent: one at 1.3 mm s~1, a second near zero velocity, and a third at 1.1mm s 1. Because of the absence of peaks at velocities greater than 1.1 mm s~1, neither of the outer peaks can be ascribed to ferromagnetic metallic iron. The only assignment consistent with known Mossbauer param- eters requires pairing the two outer peaks into a doublet, which would have an isomer shift of 0.10 mm s~1 and a quadrupole splitting of 2.41 mm s~1. These values agree well with those of iron pentacarbonyl, Fe(CO)5, which are 0.09 and 2.57 mm s~1, respectively [28]. The remaining peak near zero velocity can be assigned to superparamagnetic metallic iron. Because of the asymmetry in this peak, a better fit can be obtained if two singlets are used, as indicated in Table 2. Volatility study To test the volatility of the iron pentacarbonyl formed during exposure to carbon monoxide, the following experiment was performed. A sample of the cluster-derived carbon black-supported catalyst was reduced at 673 K for 2 h in the chemisorption apparatus and then exposed to 28 kPa of CO. After 24 h, 2.78 mol CO per mol Fe had been adsorbed. Carbon monoxide at a pressure of 100 kPa was then flowed through the sample cell at a rate of approximately 80 ml min\"1 for 11 h. After stopping the flow, the CO was desorbed by heating to 393 K under vacuum; 2.18 mol CO per mol Fe were 393 collected. Upon re-exposure to 28 kPa of CO, the same amount of CO was readsorbed. Following this experiment, chemical analysis indicated that the sample still contained 0.95 wt.% iron, the same as the original sample, i.e. no iron had been removed by this treatment. Discussion Other authors have previously reported high CO uptakes and/or slowly increasing CO uptakes on high surface area, carbon-supported iron catalysts. Jung and coworkers [19, 20, 29] reported values for room-temperature CO/Fe ratios between 0.4 and 0.5 for iron supported on carbon black and polymeric carbon; on one sample, 16 h was required for equilibration. The CO uptakes were much higher at 300 K than at 195 or 373 K, and it was suggested that small metallic iron particles formed subcarbonyl species in the presence of CO. Similar results have been observed for other carbon- supported iron catalysts (e.g. [15, 21, 22]), with a CO/Fe ratio as high as 2.1 being reported [22]. These results were also attributed to iron subcarbonyl formation. The Mossbauer spectra presented in this paper show conclusively that in the case of our sample the high CO uptakes are due primarily to the forma- tion of iron pentacarbonyl. Approximately 25% of the area of spectrum 4B can be assigned to the Fe(CO)s doublet; however, a significantly larger frac- tion of the iron is probably present in this form, since the recoil-free fraction of weakly-adsorbed Fe(CO)s would be expected to be low. Indeed, exposure to CO decreases the recoil-free fraction of this sample by 60%, from 0.35 to 0.14, while treatment of the graphite-supported sample in CO decreased the recoil-free fraction by only about 20%, from 0.60 to 0.47. Thus, most of the 'missing' spectral area can probably be attributed to the low recoil-free frac- tion of the Fe(CO)5. In fact, the Mossbauer spectroscopy and CO uptake results agree quantitatively if the recoil-free fraction of Fe(CO)5 is approx- imately equal to 15% of that value for the small metallic iron particles on carbon black prior to exposure to CO. The thermodynamics for the formation of iron pentacarbonyl from iron and carbon monoxide are favorable at room temperature. The Gibbs free energy change for the reaction Fe(s) + 5CO(g) Fe(CO)s(g) is 10.9 kJ mol\"1 at 298 K [30]. This means that in 30 kPa of CO at 295 K, the equilibrium pressure of Fe(CO)s is approximately 19 kPa. Because the vapor pressure of Fe(CO)s is less than 4 kPa under these conditions, essen- tially all iron would be converted to liquid iron pentacarbonyl at equilib- rium. That this does not occur on most catalysts may be attributed to kinetic limitations, presumably in extracting the iron atom from the metal particle so that multiple CO ligands may be attached. 394 It is possible that iron pentacarbonyl can be formed on the carbon black-supported catalyst because the small size of the metallic iron particles removes the kinetic limitations to multiple CO addition. Small particles exhibit a higher degree of coordinative unsaturation than do larger particles, where well-defined low index planes can form due to the low degree of curvature. Furthermore, Tops0e et al. [31] have shown that the nature of CO adsorption on metallic iron depends on particle size, with smaller particles generally showing higher CO/Fe stoichiometries. However, particle size measurements indicate that small iron particles are present in all catalysts studied [23], yet only the carbon black-supported samples form Fe(CO)5. Additionally, the extent of CO adsorption on the cluster-derived carbon black-supported sample indicates that, following reduction at 773 K, approximately 60% of the iron must be converted by CO to Fe(CO)s. Inspection of the particle size distribution obtained from the magnetic susceptibility data for this sample indicates that some particles as large as 2.5 nm in diameter are attacked by CO as well. Thus, while small particle size may well be a prerequisite for the formation of iron pentacarbonyl, it does not appear to be the only important factor. Mossbauer spectroscopic investigations [23] of these catalysts indicated that, following reduction, the metallic iron particles in the graphite- and conventionally-prepared carbon black-supported catalysts had higher mag- netic anisotropy constants than did the iron particles in the carbon black- supported catalyst prepared from Fe3(CO)i2. This difference was attributed to a non-spherical shape and possibly a close separation between metallic iron particles in the former two samples. The iron particles on the conven- tionally-prepared carbon black-supported sample were believed to be located near the graphitic external surfaces of the carbon granules. In contrast, the iron particles on the cluster-derived carbon black-supported sample were located more uniformly within the pore structure of the carbon support. Graphitic surfaces, such as found on the graphite support and on the out- side of the carbon black particles, may favor non-spherical, flat geometries (e.g. [10]). The more reactive sites in the pores of carbon black, however, may favor more spherical particles. We may suggest, therefore, that the small, spherical iron particles in the cluster-derived carbon black-supported sample could be more easily attacked by CO because of their high degree of coordinative unsaturation. In contrast, the less-spherical particles present more stable low-index planes that cannot be easily disrupted. The small amount of Fe(CO)5 formation indicated by CO chemisorption on the conventionally-prepared carbon black-supported sample may be due to the small fraction (10-15%) of iron which is present inside the reactive pore structure, where it presumably behaves like the iron in the cluster-derived sample. The absence of Fe(CO)s formation for the alumina-supported iron sample may be related to a non-spherical metallic iron particle morphology; however, we are unable at present to document further this possibility. Another possible explanation for the extensive formation of Fe(CO)5 on the cluster-derived carbon black-supported sample is that the reactive 395 carbon surface within the pore structure serves to scavenge the iron penta- carbonyl as it is formed at the iron/carbon interface. In fact, evidence for the stabilization of Fe(CO)5 on carbon black is provided in the following paragraph. Because the vapor pressure of liquid iron pentacarbonyl at 298 K is approximately 4 kPa [30], it was at first surprising that iron could not be removed by flowing CO over the catalysts that formed Fe(CO)s. It is likely, therefore, that the iron pentacarbonyl is adsorbed on the carbon black sur- face. A free energy of adsorption of 20 kJ mol\"1 would be sufficient to lower the vapor pressure to approximately 1 Pa. This stabilization, perhaps in addition to diffusional limitations, would prevent a significant fraction of the iron from leaving the sample. The Mossbauer quadrupole splitting of the Fe(CO)s doublet is 2.41 mm s~1, somewhat less than the expected 2.57 mm s~1, and this spectroscopic difference may be due to a coordination of the cluster to the surface. During the course of this work, researchers in other laboratories have also observed the formation of Fe(CO)5 on Fe/carbon black catalysts prepared with Fe3(CO)i2. Chen et al. [32, 33] observed a Mossbauer spec- troscopy feature assigned to Fe(CO)5 when some catalyst samples were exposed to 1 atm of CO. Carbon monoxide chemisorption uptakes were near 0.5 mol CO/mol Fe. Formation of Fe(CO)5 was not as extensive as in our samples, presumably due to the higher loading (10 wt.%) and preparation of their samples by incipient wetness. Conclusions Carbon monoxide uptakes of graphite- and alumina-supported iron sam- ples were consistent with particle size distributions derived from magnetic susceptibility measurements. Carbon black-supported catalysts, however, adsorbed larger quantities of CO than could be accounted for by the expected adsorption stoichiometry. A sample prepared from Fe 3(00) 12 adsorbed approximately 3.3 mol CO/mol Fe following reduction at 773 K. Mossbauer spectroscopy revealed that these large uptakes were due to the formation of Fe(CO)s. Particle size alone can be discounted as the reason for Fe(CO)s formation, since small iron particles had been shown to be present in all samples. It can be suggested that particle morphology plays an impor- tant role, with flat or large particles exhibiting stable surface planes unable to form Fe(CO)5, while coordinatively unsaturated iron surface atoms on more spherical, small iron particles are more reactive. These small particles may be located at the more chemically reactive sites inside the carbon black pore structure.

The effects of the exposure to carbon monoxide of small metallic iron particles supported on carbon black, alumina and graphite were studied. The alumina- and graphite-supported samples adsorbed amounts of CO consistent with the metallic iron surface areas estimated by magnetic susceptibility. The carbon black-supported samples, however, adsorbed large amounts of CO, in some cases an average of more than three molecules per iron atom. Mössbauer spectroscopy showed that iron pentacarbonyl was formed. The formation of Fe(CO)5 is thought to require small, coordinatively unsaturated iron particles. References 1 S.J. Tauster S.C.
