Graphical abstract p-Xylene was directly oxidized into 4-hydroxymethylbenzoic acid over Cu-MOF under mild reaction conditions. p-Xylene, a cheap industrial raw material, is mainly used to synthesize terephthalic acid. However, p-xylene was oxidized rarely to other oxygen-containing derivatives. On the other hand, current methods for synthesis of 4-hydroxymethylenzoic acid suffer from multistep reactions, long reaction time, high temperature, high pressure, and lower selectivity. In this work, p-xylene was directly oxidized into 4-hydroxymethylbenzoic acid using Cu-MOF as the catalyst, acetonitrile as the solvent, and 30% H2O2 as the oxidant under mild conditions. Very high selectivity (99.2%) of 4-hydroxymethylbenzoic acid and good substrate conversion (85.5%) of p-xylene were achieved at 30 °C for 5 h. Fast hot catalyst filtration experiments proved that Cu-MOF acted as a heterogeneous catalyst. It can be reused three times without losing its activity. Under optimized conditions, the selectivity of 4-hydroxymethyl benzoic acid and the conversion of p-xylene were 97.6% and 84.8% even though the experiment was amplified 15-folds. The efficiency of H2O2 was also up to 92.0%. The reaction mechanism was proposed combined with the analysis of XRD, FT-IR and XPS. All data displayed that Cu-MOF shows great potential as a catalyst for highly selective oxidation of stable C–H to high value-added compounds containing two diverse C–O bands under mild conditions. It also opens a new way to use of p-xylene. Keywords p-xylene 4-Hydroxymethylbenzoic acid Cu-MOF Oxidation 1 Introduction Selective functionalization of unactivated C–H bond to C–O bond represents an important and long-standing goal in chemistry. Achieving regio- and chemoselective functionalization of different C–H bonds (sp2 and sp3) to C–X (XC, O, and N) bonds also remains a tremendous challenge in organic and organometallic chemistry, although these transformations have broad potential in synthesis because CH bonds are ubiquitous in organic substances [1–3]. Especially, C–H bond is very hard to oxide once more active C–X bonds exist in the substrate or the reaction system. p-Xylene (PX), as a cheap industrial raw material, is mainly used for synthesizing terephthalic acid (TPA) to prepare polyester resins [4]. However, PX was oxidized rarely to other oxygen-containing derivatives. 4-Hydroxymethylbenzoic acid (HMBA) has widely drawn close attention because its’ hydroxyl and carboxyl groups could be reacted with various functional groups. HMBA could be used to synthesize drugs such as disease inhibitors, hydrophobic peptides, and medicine controlled release agent [5–8]. Moreover, HMBA, as a linker, was also utilized to prepare sweetness sensor [9], dye-sensitized solar cells [10], and photocatalyst [11]. However, HMBA were still mainly synthesized by halogenation and hydrolysis of p-toluic acid (Scheme 1 (A)). Interestingly, Annen et al. reported that HMBA could be prepared by catalytic aerobic dehydrogenation of 1,4-benzenedimethanol using rhodium(I) amido N-heterocyclic carbene complex as the catalyst under alkaline conditions (Scheme 1(B)) [12]. Unfortunately, the yield of HMBA was very low (only 27%). Moreover, these methods always need critical conditions, such as, multistep reactions, high temperature, high pressure, and long time. Moreover, the selectivity of product is poor, which results in large amounts of unmanageable wastes. As far as we know, investigation has been hardly conducted in one-step synthesis of HMBA by liquid-phase catalytic oxidation of PX Since hydroxymethyl group is more easily oxidized than methyl group. Recently, HMBA was synthesized by the oxidation PX using xylene monooxygenase as the catalyst (Scheme 1(C)) [13]. However, the application of this method was limited by a large number of by-products (4-methylbenzylalcohol, p-tolualdehyde, and p-toluic acid), the longer reaction time, and the lower yield. It is, therefore, of great practical interest to develop a simple and efficient process for the production of HMBA using PX as cheap raw material. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a type of zeolite-like crystalline porous materials, have been extensively exploited in applications for gas storage, separation and biomimetic catalysis because of their extremely large surface areas, wide variety of shapes and porosity, and mimic enzymatic activities [14,15]. Especially, the use of MOFs as heterogeneous catalysts is of interests due to possible advantages such as ease of separation, efficient recycling, and minimization of trace metal in products, and improved handling and process control [16–18]. Due to high selectivity and mild conditions, MOFs have been used as selective oxidation catalysts such as epoxide of alkenes, oxidations of (cyclo)alkanes and alcohols [16,18,19]. However, selective oxidations for C–H bonds (sp and sp3) of alkylbenzenes to form simultaneously diverse C–H bonds over MOFs were scarcely studied under fairly mild conditions. Recently, we reported one-step preparation for 2, 5-dihydroxyterephathalic acid (H4DHT) by the hydroxylation of sp C–H bond and the oxidation of sp3 C–H oxidation of PX using M-MCM-41 in mixed solvents [20]. We found that meso-materials could be used for the selective oxidation-functionalization of alkylbenzenes to synthesize high value chemicals and the preparation of o-hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives by non-Kolbe-Schmitt Process. Herein, we presented a simple and efficient preparation for HMBA by one-step selective oxidation two methyl groups of PX to hydroxymethyl and carboxyl using Cu-MOF as the catalyst under mild conditions (Scheme 1(D)). This is the first report on the production of HMBA in this way as we know. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Synthesis of Cu-MOF Cu-MOF was synthesized via a hydrothermal method according to Loiseau’s previous report [21]. In a typical synthesis, 5.0 g (24 mM) benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid and 10.0 g (43 mM) copper (II) nitrate hemipentahydrate were dissolved in 250 mL of solvent consisting of equal parts N, N-dimethylformamide, ethanol and deionized water. The solution was filled in a 1.0 L wide mouth glass jar and heated at 90 °C for 20 h. After cooling, the product in the solution was filtered off to remover excessive reactants, washed with DMF and immersed in dichloromethane for 3 day. The fresh dichloromethane was replenished three times and removed under vacuum at 170 °C. The pure Cu-MOF was obtained. Characterization of Cu-MOF, including before reaction and after reaction, sees in the Supplementary Material. 2.2 General procedure for the oxidation reaction All oxidation reactions of PX were performed in YuHua Parallel Reactor (PPS-2510, five parallel reactions) equipped with magnetic stirrer, super constant temperature and thermometer. A typical reaction was as follows: PX (1.0 mL, 8.1 mmol), Cu-MOF (30.0 mg), acetonitrile (10.0 mL), and 30% H2O2 (3.0 mL) was successively added into the flask. The mixture was stirred at 30 °C for 5 h, cooled to room temperature and filtered. 2.3 Analyses of reaction products Products were analyzed by a Purkinje General HPLC liquid chromatograph (LC-600) equipped with a UV detector and a C-18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm ×10 μm). 0.1% acetic acid in pure water (A) and methanol (B) were of the mobile phase, and the flow rate was controlled 0.85 mL/min. The HPLC program was as follows: 0–8 min, 65% A; 8–14, 65–35% A; 14–40, 35% A; 40–46, 35–15% A; 46–60, 15% A. The other parameters were 30 °C (column temperature), 235 nm (UV detector), 61 min (stop time), and 20 μL (sample size). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Effect of reaction temperatures Considering the catalytic activity of Cu-MOF affected by reaction temperature, oxidations of PX (1.0 mL) at different reaction temperatures were firstly investigated using 1.0 mL 30% H2O2 as the oxidant (Fig. 1 ). Obviously, both the conversion of PX (13.1%) and the selectivity of HMBA (33.4%) were quite unsatisfactory if the oxidation reaction could be operated at 70 °C. It was found that there were lots of TPA, H4DHT and p-benzoquinone-2,5-dicarboxylic acid (BQDCA) in the reaction system, coming possibly from the over-oxidation of HMBA (Scheme 2 ). Meanwhile, Cu ion and 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid were detected in the liquid phase by ICP-AES and HPLC, indicating Cu-MOF collapsed and/or dissociated at elevated temperature. The co-effect of free copper ions and higher temperature resulted possibly in the over-oxidation of HMBA and accelerated the decomposition of H2O2. Simultaneously, under the catalysis of free copper ions, HMBA, TPA, and H4DHT were easy oxidized more than PX, causing that the conversion of PX was reduced. To improve the selective conversion of the substrate to the desired product, the reaction temperature was reduced from 70 °C to 30 °C. HMBA was increased consumedly and other oxides (TPA, H4DHT and BQDCA) were deduced sharply with reducing reaction temperature. At 30 °C, the selectivity of HMBA and the conversion of PX were reached 99.3% and 28.6%, respectively. Meanwhile, the conversion of PX displayed the trend of increase first and then decline. Maximum conversion rate (34.0%) occurred at 50 °C. All data suggested that the lower temperature was favourable for the synthesis of HMBA by the one-step oxidation of P X . 3.2 Influence of reaction time To further reveal the effect of temperatures (30 °C and 70 °C), the oxidation reaction was investigated under various reaction times (Fig. 2 ). From Fig. 2(A), it was found that the selective conversion of PX was increased with increasing the reaction time at 30 °C. Furthermore, by-products, including p-methyl benzyl alcohol and p-toluic acid, were reduced during the extended reaction time. After 5 h, the selectivity of HMBA and total amount of by-products was 99.3% and only 0.7%, respectively. Except for PX and HMBA, there was a small amount of p-methyl benzyl alcohol and p-toluic acid in the reaction system. PTA, H4DHT, and BQDCA were not detected, stating clearly that HMBA was not over-oxidized under this condition. The results also indicated Cu-MOF didn’t collapse and/or dissociate at lower temperature. As seen from Fig. 2(B), it was could see that the conversion of PX was very low (about 13.1%) although the reaction time was prolonged to 5 h. In contrast to the selectivity of HMBA reduced dramatically, by-products were increased sharply with increasing the reaction time. Unlike low temperature (30 °C), main by-products were PTA, H4DHT, and BQDCA, coming from the over-oxidized HMBA. All facts proved that the oxidation pathways were different at various temperatures (Scheme 3 (A) and (B)). At lower temperature (Scheme 3(A)), PX was firstly oxidized to p-methyl benzyl alcohol and benzyl alcohol coordination complexes which came possibly from p-methyl benzyl alcohol coordinated with Cu-MOF. And then, these compounds were converted to p-toluic acid coordination complexes, reacting with peroxide to produce HMBA. At higher temperature (Scheme 3(B)), however, p-toluic acid did not coordinated with the catalyst because most of Cu-MOF were decomposed to 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid and Cu(II). So, p-toluic acid was converted catalytically by Cu (II) to HMBA and TPA [4,22], which were further oxidized to H4DHT and BQDCA. 3.3 Influence of amounts of H2O2 To optimize reaction conditions, the influence of amounts of H2O2 (30%) was examined using Cu-MOF as the catalyst and acetonitrile as the solvent under 30 °C for 5 h (Fig. 3 ). The conversion of PX was increased with increasing amount of H2O2. More than 86.1% PX was converted once 5.0 mL H2O2 was added into the reaction system. However, the increase rate was very weak if the amount of H2O2 was exceeded 3.0 mL. Satisfactorily, the selectivity of HMBA still had 96.4% as long as the dosage of H2O2 would not be more than 3.0 ml, although it decreased sharply in the excess of H2O2 (>3.0 mL). Under the action of various dosages of H2O2, types and quantities of by-products were very different. There was only p-toluic acid was detected when the dosage of H2O2 was less than 3.0 mL. But, TPA and H4DHT were appeared because of the over-oxidation of HMBA only if more H2O2 (> 3.0 mL) was used in the reaction system. Based on our previous calculation method [21], the efficiency of H2O2 decreased from 93.0% to 63.0% when its dosage increased from 1.0 mL to 5.0 mL (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, the efficiency of H2O2 was higher than 85.0% once its amount was lower than 3.0 mL. All data showed that the selective of PX was the following reaction path under such conditions (Scheme 4 ). PX was firstly oxidized to p-toluic acid under the interaction of Cu-MOF and H2O2. The methyl of p-toluic acid was further hydroxylated by H2O2 to obtain HMBA (Scheme 4(A)). Due to the hydroxymethyl of HMBA oxidized more than the methyl of p-toluic acid, HMBA was converted to TPA under the action of a large amount of H2O2 (Scheme 4(B)). The ortho-position C–H bond of the carboxyl group of TPA was ultimately hydroxylated to H4DHT under the action of Cu-catalyst (Scheme 4(B)). 3.4 Effect of the amount of Cu-MOF As an important factor, the effect of the amount of Cu-MOF for the selective conversion of PX to HMBA was investigate at 30 °C for 5 h using PX (1.0 mL) as the substrate, acetonitrile (10.0 mL) as the solvent, and 30% H2O2 (3.0 mL) as the oxidant. From Fig. 4 , it was found that the appropriate amount of Cu-MOF would be beneficial to oxidize selectively PX to HMBA. The amount of catalyst was too low to favour the conversion of PX, although the selectivity of HMBA was satisfactory. Moreover, the high amount of Cu-MOF was not conducive to convert selectively to form desired product. The conversion of PX and the selectivity of HMBA were respectively 82.2% and 97.0% when 30.0 mg Cu-MOF was used. Simultaneously, the selectivity of by-products, p-toluic acid, was only 3.0%. However, once amounts of the catalyst were of more than 30.0 mg, PTA was also appeared in the reaction system. 3.5 Effect of solvents Due to the selective oxidation affected importantly by types and amount of solvents, the solvent effect was discussed. Amounts of acetonitrile were first investigated for the selective synthesis of HMBA using PX (1.0 mL) as the substrate, Cu-MOF (30.0 mg) as the catalyst, and 30% H2O2 (3.0 mL) as the oxidant at 30 °C for 5 h (Fig. 5 ). Although there was no significant change in the conversion of PX and the selectivity of HMBA, more suitable dosages of acetonitrile were 20.0 mL. Under this condition, 85.8% PX was converted and 99.2% HMBA was obtained in the reaction system. Moreover, p-toluic acid and p-methyl benzyl alcohol were main by-products under low and high dosages of acetonitrile, respectively. This was because various dosages of solvent resulted in the difference of the unit concentration of H2O2. To further understand the effect of other solvents, some common solvents were studied under the same conditions (Table 1 ). Although PX was more or less converted to HMBA in these solvents, the conversion and selectivity were various obviously. The order for the conversion of PX was as follows: acetonitrile > acetone > ethanol > acetic acid > ethyl acetate > methanol > chloroform > diethyl ether > cyclohexane > water. Meanwhile, the order for the selectivity of HMBA was as follows: acetonitrile > cyclohexane > methanol > acetone > ethanol > diethyl ether > water > chloroform > ethyl acetate > acetic acid. Furthermore, to investigate the leaching of active sites of the catalyst, copper ion in all solutions reacted after 1 h was detected by ICP-AES. Copper ions in most solvents were below the detection limit indicating Cu-MOF was very stable. But, almost all copper sites of Cu-MOF were leached into the solvent when acetic acid was used. Simultaneously, partial copper ions were detected using ethyl acetate as the solvent possible because ethyl acetate was hydrolyzed catalytically to acetic acid and ethanol under the action of Cu-MOF. Especially, the lower conversion of PX in water was partially because the solubility of PX was so low that it interacted difficultly with oxidant and catalyst. In addition, oxidation products of PX were more oxidized easily than itself, resulting in PX was extremely difficult to be reacted with oxidant. All data indicated that acetonitrile as the solvent was suitable for the selective oxidation of PX to HMBA. 3.6 Test of the stability of Cu-MOF To understand the thermal stability of Cu-MOF, hot filtration experiments were operated after 2 h at 30 °C and 70 °C (Fig. 6 ). Obviously, PX reaction with 30% H2O2 has been stopped at 30 °C once the catalyst would be filtrated from the reaction medium. In contrast with lower temperature (30 °C), the reaction continued after Cu-MOF filtrated at 70 °C. Experimental results proved again the conversion of PX affected seriously by the reaction temperature. To further verify the stability of the catalyst at 30 °C, recycle tests of Cu-MOF was studied during the selective conversion of PX to HMBA under the optimized conditions. The catalytic activity, as shown Table 2 , remained nearly the same even after the fourth run. And the efficiency of H2O2 was up to 93.0% even if Cu-MOF was used five times (Table 2). Moreover, The detection result by ICP-AES revealed copper ion was not leached from the heterogeneous material. The characterization of FT-IR, BET, XPS also displayed Cu-MOF was very stable before and after reaction (from Figure S1 to Figure S7). All results suggested that Cu-MOF act as a heterogeneous catalyst in the reaction system. 3.7 Investigation of the amplification of the reaction system According to abovementioned experimental data, optimized conditions were summarized as follows: 30% H2O2(V):PX(V) = 3:1, CH3CN(V):PX(V) = 20:1, Cu-MOF(mg):PX(mL) = 30:1, 30 °C and 5 h. To investigate the possibility of industrial application, selective converting PX to HMBA was amplified from 1-fold to 15-fold under optimized conditions (Table 3 ). Although productivity reduced with the amplification of the reaction system, experimental results were satisfactory (Table 3, Entry 2–5). More than half of PX (65.3%) was oxidized selectively HMBA (89.5%) after amplified 15-fold (Table 3, Entry 5), although the efficiency of H2O2 has significantly decreased from 93.1% to 69.0%. In this reaction system, by-products were p-methyl benzyl alcohol, p-toluic acid and PTA. This might be due to the excessive addition of hydrogen peroxide. To further improve the yield of HMBA, more solvent (450 mL) was added to impel PX convert selectively HMBA. Consistent with prediction, the conversion of PX, the selectivity of HMBA and the efficiency of H2O2 were up to 73.1%, 92.6% and 78.0%, respectively (Table 3, Entry 6). Furthermore, to cut down target product contact with oxidant, H2O2 was added three times (Table 3, Entry 7) and dropped (Table 3, Entry 8) to reduce its’ concentration in 300 mL acetonitrile. The selective oxidation efficiency of PX was improved further when 30% H2O2 was dropped in the reaction system (Table 3, Entry 8). The selectivity of HMBA and the efficiency of H2O2 were almost the same with the unamplified experiment. The results indicated that the catalytic efficiency of Cu-MOF was not significantly decreased. Simultaneously, scale up experiment proved this method had potential industrial application. Compared with other porous materials [23,24], Cu-MOF displayed high performance in the selective functionalization of diverse C–H bonds of PX to C–O bonds. Either one methyl was oxidized selectively or two methyl groups were converted to same C–O group when Au-Pd/MIL-101 [23] and Au-Pd/C [24] were used as catalysts. Simultaneously, the lower selective conversion of PX was still existed although higher temperature and longer time were given (Table 4 , entry 2 and 3). Furthermore, in addition to p-toluic acid, among of by-products were p-toluyl alcohol and p-tolualdehyde in these reaction systems. These data proved Cu-MOF displayed excellently selective conversion of inactivated C–H bond to C–O bond under mild conditions. 3.8 Comparison of physicochemical properties before and after reaction To discover the unparalleled properties, the structure of Cu-MOF before and after reaction was compared by FT-IR, XRD, BET, and XPS (from Figure S1 to Figure S7, Table S1). Spectrums of FT-IR were consistently whether before reaction or after reaction (Figure S1), indicating the structure and ligand of Cu-MOF was almost unchanged. XRDs (Figure S2) discovered the crystalline form of Cu-MOF was purified after reaction because of interaction with solvent and the catalyst. This conjecture was verified by surface area, pore volume, and pore size (Table S1). Adsorption and desorption isothermal curves (Figure S3) displayed the similar structure of Cu-MOF at before and after reaction. Meanwhile, the unchanged structure of Cu-MOF was also proved by XPSs of Cu-MOF (from Figure S4 to Figure S7). All characterizations indicated Cu-MOF was a heterogeneous catalyst and was not changed during the selective oxidation of PX to HMBA. 3.9 Proposed reaction mechanism According to the experimental data and characterizations of Cu-MOF, the proposed mechanism was as follows. On the one hand, LnCu (Cu-MOF, Ln = benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid) coordinated easily with hydrogen peroxide to generate Cu-O-O-H complex with functional ligand (Scheme 5 (1)). LnCu-O-O-H was very important as active intermediates in biological oxygenases such as dopamine β-hydroxylase (DβH) [25,26]. LnCu-O-O-H reacted with the C–H bond of PX by hydrogen abstract to form water and Cu(II) alkoxide (Scheme 5(2)) [27]. One the other hand, homolytic cleavage of hydrogen peroxide brought under the action LnCu (Cu-MOF) to produce hydroxyl radical (Scheme 5(3)). The hydroxyl radical would be abstract one hydrogen of methyl of Cu(II) alkoxide to water and Cu(II) alkoxide radical (Scheme 5(4)) [28–30]. Cu(II) alkoxide radical reacted continuously with hydroxyl radical until the carbonyl group was formed (Scheme 5(5)-(10)). Finally, acid derivative of Cu(II) alkoxide was acidolysed to obtain HMBA and LnCu (Cu-MOF) [31]. 4 Conclusions Selective oxidation of p-xylene to 4-hydroxymethylbenzoic acid was studied. Reaction temperature, amounts of H2O2, types and amounts of solvents, amounts and thermal stability and amounts of catalyst were investigated. The conversion of p-xylene and the selectivity of 4-hydroxymethylbenzoic acid were respectively 85.5% and 99.2% using Cu-MOF as the catalyst and acetonitrile as the solvent at 30 ° C for 5 h, indicating Cu-MOF was a high performance oxidation catalyst under mild conditions. Thermal filtration experiment, recycle tests, and physical characterizations displayed Cu-MOF was very stable under given reaction conditions. Under optimized conditions, the selectivity of 4-hydroxymethylbenzoic acid (97.6%) and the conversion of p-xylene (84.8%) were even though the experiment was amplified 15-folds. Simultaneously, the efficiency of H2O2 was up to 92.0%. All data displayed that Cu-MOF shows great potential as a catalyst for highly selective oxidation of stable C–H to high value-added compounds containing two diverse C–O bands under mild conditions. It also opens a new way to use of p-xylene. Acknowledgements The work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project 21573193, 21603188 and 21773204).

        "dc:description": "p-Xylene, a cheap industrial raw material, is mainly used to synthesize terephthalic acid. However, p-xylene was oxidized rarely to other oxygen-containing derivatives. On the other hand, current methods for synthesis of 4-hydroxymethylenzoic acid suffer from multistep reactions, long reaction time, high temperature, high pressure, and lower selectivity. In this work, p-xylene was directly oxidized into 4-hydroxymethylbenzoic acid using Cu-MOF as the catalyst, acetonitrile as the solvent, and 30% H2O2 as the oxidant under mild conditions. Very high selectivity (99.2%) of 4-hydroxymethylbenzoic acid and good substrate conversion (85.5%) of p-xylene were achieved at 30 °C for 5 h. Fast hot catalyst filtration experiments proved that Cu-MOF acted as a heterogeneous catalyst. It can be reused three times without losing its activity. Under optimized conditions, the selectivity of 4-hydroxymethyl benzoic acid and the conversion of p-xylene were 97.6% and 84.8% even though the experiment was amplified 15-folds. The efficiency of H2O2 was also up to 92.0%. The reaction mechanism was proposed combined with the analysis of XRD, FT-IR and XPS. All data displayed that Cu-MOF shows great potential as a catalyst for highly selective oxidation of stable C–H to high value-added compounds containing two diverse C–O bands under mild conditions. It also opens a new way to use of p-xylene.",
