Nitrogen oxides (NO x ) present in flue gas are economically renewable N1 resources. Unlike traditional selective catalytic reduction processes that convert NO into N2, redirecting NO towards the synthesis of value-added NH3 offers significant practical benefits. In this study, a Ti-based metal-organic framework (Ti-MOF), specifically MIL-125, was utilized as a support for Fe, which was subsequently calcined at 400 °C to produce a Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF catalyst. The resulting catalyst demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving 99% NO conversion and 95% NH3 selectivity under optimal conditions of 450 °C, 0.1 MPa, and a gas hourly space velocity of 38000 mL g–1 h−1. Additionally, the catalyst exhibited excellent stability and resistance to water and sulfur. The high efficiency of Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF is attributed to the abundance of Fe2+ sites at the reaction temperature, which enhances NO adsorption and activation. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations suggest that NO undergoes hydrogenation at the N-terminus on the Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF surface, leading directly to NH3 synthesis rather than dissociation followed by hydrogenation. This catalyst presents a novel approach for converting NO x into high-value chemical products. Graphical Abstract A novel Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF catalyst exhibiting a NH3 selectivity of 95% and a NO conversion of 99% was obtained. It was found that the abundant Fe2+ site on the surface of Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF was responsible for the high performance of NO hydrogenation of NH3 at reaction temperature. Keywords Nitrogen oxides Synthetic ammonia NO hydrogenation Selective catalytic reduction Denitration 1 Introduction Nitrogen oxides (NO x ), primarily emitted by power plants and motor vehicles, are atmospheric pollutants with serious environmental and health impacts due to their high toxicity [1–3]. Nitric oxide (NO), a major component of NO x , is of particular concern, prompting the need for effective strategies to mitigate its effects and safeguard human health and environmental sustainability [4]. Since the 1970s, various technologies have been developed to reduce NO emissions. Among these technologies, selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO with NH3 (NH3-SCR) to produce N2 has emerged as a prominent method. The most used SCR catalyst is V2O5-WO3/TiO2, which operates efficiently within a relatively narrow temperature window of 300–400 °C [5–7]. In addition, significant research efforts have been focused on developing catalysts for NH3-SCR, with Mn-based [8], Ce-based [9], and Cu-based [10] catalysts demonstrating excellent performance. The conversion of NO to N2 in this process typically follows either the Eley-Rideal (E-R) or the Lindemann-Hinshelwood (L-H) mechanism. Although effective for NO elimination, producing NH3-SCR requires substantial ammonia consumption [11–13]. Currently, the Haber–Bosch process is the predominant industrial method of NH3 production [14–17]. However, this process faces significant challenges because of the high bond energy of the N2 molecule (946 kJ mol–1), which makes N2 difficult to adsorb and activate, resulting in high energy consumption [18,19]. In contrast, NO, a nitrogen-containing molecule, is a more reactive and economically viable nitrogen resource. The conversion of NO into ammonia using green hydrogen would enable the sustainable production of high-value nitrogen-containing chemicals. However, to the best of our knowledge, the conversion of NO into NH3 has rarely been reported. Significant challenges remain, such as the purification of NO from flue gas and the development of highly efficient catalysts for this conversion. In this study, an Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF catalyst was synthesized using an impregnation method to assess its catalytic efficiency in reducing NO to NH3. The Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF catalyst exhibits exceptional NH3 selectivity and NO conversion at 450 °C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to investigate the potential for synthesizing ammonia from NO. These calculations were initially focused on analyzing the electronic structure of the NO adsorption state to elucidate the mechanism by which Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF activates NO molecules. Subsequent studies on the hydrogenation of nitric oxide to ammonia, involving both associative and dissociative pathways, revealed that the Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF catalyst effectively promoted production via an associative mechanism, confirming its thermodynamic feasibility. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Analytical-grade terephthalic acid (C8H6O4), dimethyl formamide (HCON(CH3)2), methanol (CH3OH), titanium isopropoxide (C12H28O4Ti), ferric chloride tetrahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O), tetrabutyl titanate (C16H36O4Ti), and ethanol (C2H5OH) were purchased from reputable suppliers. 2.2 Synthesis of TiO2 precursor, TiO2-HC, and Fe2O3/TiO2-HC For the synthesis, 6.05 g C16H36O4Ti was dissolved in 100 mL of water to yield a TiO2 solution via hydrolysis. The resulting product was centrifuged, washed three times with ethanol, and dried in an oven at 80 °C to obtain the TiO2 precursor. After a calcination period of 4 h at 400 °C, the obtained catalyst was named TiO2-HC. Next, 0.6 g of the TiO2 precursor was added to 100 mL of pure water. Simultaneously, 0.289 g of FeCl3·6H2O was dissolved in 20 mL of pure water and subsequently added to the aforementioned solution. The reaction mixture was allowed to react in a 60 °C water bath for 1 h. The resulting product was centrifuged, washed thrice with ethanol, dried in an oven at 80 °C, and finally calcined at 400 °C for 4 h to obtain the desired Fe2O3/TiO2-HC catalyst. 2.3 Synthesis of Ti-MOF (MIL-125), TiO2-MOF, and Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF Here, 3.0 g C8H6O4 was dissolved in a solution of 54 mL of HCON(CH3)2 and 6 mL of CH3OH. Subsequently, 1.56 mL C12H28O4Ti was added to the mixture. The resulting solution was vigorously stirred for 5 min, transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave, and incubated in an oven set at 150 °C for 12 h. The obtained product, i.e., Ti-MOF, specifically MIL-125, was collected via centrifugation, triple washing with C2H5OH, and oven drying at 80 °C. Finally, the product was calcined at 400 °C for 4 h to yield a TiO2-MOF catalyst. Furthermore, 0.6 g of the Ti-MOF (MIL-125) was dispersed in 100 mL water to form solution A, while 0.289 g of FeCl3·6H2O was dissolved in 20 mL of water to form solution B. Solution B was then slowly added to solution A and allowed to react in a water bath maintained at 60 °C for 1 h. The resulting product was centrifuged, washed thrice with ethanol, dried in an oven at 80 °C, and finally calcined at 400 °C for 4 h to produce the Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF catalyst. 2.4 Catalyst characterization The phase structures of the samples were thoroughly examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD; Bruker, model D8-Advance). Raman spectroscopy was conducted using a Renishaw RM1000 microspectrometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using an ESCALAB 250Xi apparatus. The morphology and microstructure of the samples were comprehensively characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, SU8020, Hitachi) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 F30 S-TWIN 300). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis was conducted at 25 °C using a Bruker A200 spectrometer. An AutoChem 2720 catalyst characterization system was used for H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), NO-temperature- programmed desorption (NO-TPD), and NO-temperature-pro- grammed desorption (NH3-TPD) measurement. Furthermore, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, pore volume, and pore diameter of the samples were measured using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020C surface area and porosity analyzer. 2.5 Catalyst performance test To assess the performance of the catalyst, the removal rate of low-concentration (350 ppm) NO and the selectivity for NH3 were measured in a fixed-bed reactor. The simulated flue gas comprised 28% NO (1250 ppm) and 40% H2 (5000 ppm), with N2 serving as the balancing gas, resulting in a total gas flow rate of 100 mL min–1. Before evaluation, the catalyst was conditioned in the reaction gas for 30 min to achieve adsorption-desorption equilibrium. The catalyst reaction performance was then analyzed at varying temperatures, ranging from 50 to 500 °C, with increments of 50 °C. Subsequently, the reactor outlet was connected to a Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) analyzer ((IS10, Thermo) to detect the concentrations of NO, NO2, N2O, and NH3. Based on these measurements, NO conversion and NH3 selectivity were calculated using the following equations: (1) NO conversion = NO in - NO out NO in × 100 % (2) NH 3 selectivity = NH 3 out NO in - NO out × 100 % 2.6 In situ diffused reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS) study In situ DRIFTS measurements were performed using a Nicolet IS50 FT-IR spectrometer. Before the experiment, the catalyst was pretreated with Ar gas at 200 °C for 1 h and then cooled to room temperature. The spectrum collected at this stage served as the baseline reference. In this experiment, (1) NO adsorption: 350 ppm NO (with Ar as the balancing gas) was introduced into the sample chamber, and (2) H2 + NO co-adsorption: a gas mixture containing 2000 ppm H2 and 350 ppm NO (with Ar as the balancing gas) was introduced into the sample chamber. The gas flow rate for the experiments was 100 mL min–1, and adsorption was performed for 60 min to achieve adsorption-desorption equilibrium. Next, infrared absorption spectra were captured as the temperature was gradually raised from 25 to 500 °C, with a heating rate set at 5 °C min–1. 2.7 Computational details All the DFT calculations were performed using the quantum ATK code and the atomic orbital linear combination method [20]. Specifically, the total spin-polarization energy was determined within the framework of the generalized gradient approximation represented by the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional. The crystalline surface of TiO2 (101) is represented by (2 × 3) TiO2 (101) facets, and the Fe atoms represent the Fe particles loaded on the TiO2 (101) surface [21]. To guarantee relaxation, a 15 Å vacuum space was introduced along the z-axis. For Brillouin zone sampling, a K-point grid centered on the Monkhorst Pack (2 × 2 × 1) grid was employed, which ensured that the total energy converged to a specified precision [22]. The convergence criterion for the structural optimization was set such that the maximum force acting on any atom was less than 0.02 eV Å–1. The transition state (TS) of the reaction was determined using the climbing image pushing elastic band (CI-NEB) method. The minimum energy path for each elemental reaction was discretized into six images spanning the initial and final states. The TS was identified as the image with the maximum amplitude along the minimum-energy path. The reaction energy (ΔE) and activation energy (E a) were calculated from the Born-Oppenheimer energy differences between the initial state (IS), the TS, and the final state (FS). The energies were calculated using the following formulae: (3) ΔE = E FS − E IS (4) E a = E TS − E IS The adsorption energy (E ads) is then calculated as follows: (5) E ads = E total − E substrate − E adsorbate where E total, E substrate, and E adsorbate are the total energies of the substrate and adsorbate, energy of the substrate, and energy of the adsorbate, respectively. 3 Results and discussion The catalytic efficiency of catalysts was evaluated for NH3 synthesis from NO was evaluated across the 25–550 °C temperature range, utilizing a fixed-bed reaction system. FTIR spectroscopy was used to detect the products. The NO conversion, NH3 selectivity, and by-product concentrations of each catalyst are shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) and S1. Below 350 °C, NO conversion remained relatively low, with N2 being the primary product. As the temperature increased, both Fe2O3/TiO2-HC and Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF showed substantial improvements in NO conversion and NH3 selectivity (Figs. 1 (a) and (b)). At 450 °C, both Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF and Fe2O3/TiO2-HC achieved 99% NO conversion. However, the Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF catalyst exhibits an NH3 selectivity of 95%, whereas the Fe2O3/TiO2-HC catalyst primarily produces N2 with an NH3 selectivity of only 23% (Figs. S1(c) and Fig. 1(b)). This difference may be attributed to the varying oxidation states of Fe at different reaction temperatures, which are influenced by the interactions between Fe2O3 and the carriers. Notably, the concentrations of by-products NO2 and N2O remain very low throughout the entire reaction process, as shown in Figs. S1(a) and (b). At the same time, the catalyst performance was compared with previous catalysts, as shown in Table S1. The long-term stability of the Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF catalyst was evaluated at 450 °C. After 110 h of stable continuous operation, the catalyst maintained a NO conversion of 99% and an NH3 selectivity of approximately 93%. Remarkably, there was no significant decline in NO conversion or NH3 selectivity throughout the testing period, demonstrating the excellent stability of the Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF catalyst (Fig. 1(c)). To further assess the stability of the catalyst, the stability of the Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF catalyst under two conditions (Figs. 1(d) and Fig. S2): one with 5% H2O, and the other with 100 ppm SO2 and 5% H2O, both at 450 °C. When only 5% H2O was introduced, almost no decrease in NO conversion was observed, and when the water was stopped, NO conversion returned to its initial state, indicating that the inhibitory effect of a large amount of water on the catalyst could be restored. When SO2 and H2O were simultaneously introduced, a marked decrease in both NO conversion and NH3 selectivity was observed, highlighting the detrimental effects of these compounds on the catalyst performance. After 1 h, the NO conversion decreased to 63.4%. Although the NO conversion partially recovered to 80.4% upon the removal of SO2 and H2O, it did not return to its original level, indicating an irreversible inhibitory effect caused by SO2 and H2O. This decrease was primarily attributed to the formation of sulfate species on the active components of the catalyst in the presence of SO2, which led to catalyst deactivation. The XRD patterns of Ti-MOF (MIL-125), TiO2, TiO2-MOF, Fe2O3/TiO2-HC, and Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF are shown in Fig. 2(a) . The distinct and sharp diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 7.8°, 11.4°, and 13.5° in the XRD pattern confirms the successful formation of Ti-MOF (MIL-125) [23]. After calcination, the characteristic peaks of Ti-MOF (MIL-125) disappeared, leaving only diffraction peaks corresponding to anatase TiO2. For the Fe2O3/TiO2-HC and Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF catalysts, the absence of detectable Fe2O3 diffraction peaks may be attributed to the large specific surface area of these catalysts, which facilitated the uniform distribution of Fe2O3 on the catalyst surface (Fig. S3 and Table S2). Nevertheless, when the Fe2O3 loading was increased to 30%, three prominent diffraction peaks emerged at 33.2°, 35.6°, and 54.1°, corresponding to the (104), (110), and (116) crystal planes of Fe2O3. This observation confirms the presence of -Fe2O3 on the catalyst surface. Furthermore, in situ XRD analysis of the Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF catalyst under an H2 atmosphere revealed that the anatase-phase TiO2 was maintained at various temperatures (Fig. S4), with no evidence of FeO or Fe phases, suggesting that the Fe components remained uniformly distributed on the catalyst surface, even after reduction. Raman spectroscopy further supported these findings (Figs. 2 (a) and (b)). Under 532 nm laser excitation, the TiO2-HC, TiO2-MOF, Fe2O3/TiO2-HC, and Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF samples exhibited four prominent scattering peaks at 145, 401, 520, and 640 cm–1, corresponding to the Eg, B1g, A1g, and E1g modes of anatase TiO2, respectively. Notably, no characteristic scattering peaks of Fe2O3 were observed in the spectra of Fe2O3/TiO2-HC and Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF. However, under 325 nm laser excitation, Fe2O3/TiO2-HC and Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF exhibited additional scattering peaks at 220, 290, and 398 cm–1, corresponding to the A1g and Eg modes of Fe2O3. These results confirm that Fe2O3 was uniformly distributed on the catalyst surface. The SEM and TEM analyses revealed that TiO2 existed in the form of nanoparticles (Figs. S5(a)–(d)), while TiO2-MOF displays a regular, pancake-like morphology with a smooth, coherent, and intact surface (Figs. S5(e)–(g)). In the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF catalyst (Fig. S5(h)), the lattice spacing of 0.35 nm is clearly visible, corresponding to the (101) plane of anatase TiO2. The energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping spectrum of Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF demonstrates a uniform distribution of Fe, Ti, and O across the catalyst (Fig. S5(i)). XPS was used to verify the surface chemical states of Fe, O, and Ti. The high-resolution XPS profiles of the Fe 2p peaks were deconvoluted to determine the chemical state of Fe (Fig. 2(d)). The analysis indicated that the Fe3+ content of Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF was higher than that in Fe2O3/TiO2-HC catalyst (Table S3) [5]. The O 1s spectra of TiO2-HC, TiO2-MOF, Fe2O3/TiO2-HC, and Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF reveal deconvoluted peaks corresponding to three different oxygen species: surface-adsorbed oxygen (OS), oxygen vacancies (OV), and lattice oxygen (OL), as depicted in Fig. 2(e) [7]. Notably, the OV ratio in Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF was 30%, significantly higher than the 25% observed for Fe2O3/TiO2-HC. However, XPS alone may not be sufficient for the comprehensive characterization of oxygen vacancies; therefore, EPR analysis was conducted to accurately identify and quantify these oxygen vacancies. As shown in Fig. 2(g), Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF exhibits a high density of oxygen vacancies, which play a crucial role in activating NO [19]. The Ti 2p XPS spectra of TiO2-HC, TiO2-MOF, Fe2O3/TiO2-HC, and Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF display two peaks at 464.4 and 458.7 eV, attributable to Ti4+ (Fig. 2(f)) [24]. The XPS spectra of the used catalyst, U-Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF, show a shift in the binding energies of Fe 2p and Ti 2p towards lower values (Figs. S6(a)–(d)), indicating the partial reduction of the catalyst during the reaction and the generation of additional OV. In addition, the appearance of nitrogen on the catalyst surface after the reaction suggests the formation of a small amount of nitrate during the reaction. The redox properties of the prepared catalysts were characterized using H2-TPR (Fig. 2(h)). The TiO2-HC and TiO2-MOF supports do not exhibit any noticeable reduction peaks over the entire temperature range, indicating weak reducibility. In contrast, the reduction profile of the Fe2O3 catalyst displayed two broad peaks centered at 408 and 539 °C, corresponding to the reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 and subsequently Fe3O4 to FeO [25]. Interestingly, compared to the Fe2O3 catalyst, the reduction temperatures of the Fe2O3/TiO2-HC and Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF catalysts were significantly lower. This reduction in temperature highlights the strong interaction between the Fe2O3 and TiO2 species, which enhances the reducibility of the Fe2O3/TiO2-HC and Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF catalysts at relatively low temperatures [26]. A model of the Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF catalyst is shown in Fig. 2(i). The NO-TPD profiles illustrate the NO desorption behavior on the solid catalyst surface after pretreatment with H2 at 450 and 350 °C(Fig. 3(a) and Fig. S7). Notably, after reduction at 450 °C, the NO adsorption capacities of both Fe2O3/TiO2-HC and Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF were enhanced, likely owing to the partial reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ (Fig. 3(a), Fig. S7, and Table S2). This result suggests that most of the NO was adsorbed on the Fe2+ sites. The H2-TPR results further indicated that at the reaction temperatures, there was a significant reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ on the surface of the Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF catalyst. This reduction enabled the adsorption and activation of a substantial amount of NO, facilitating the reaction process. NH3-TPD measurements were conducted to examine the desorption behavior of NH3 on various catalysts, as shown in Fig. 3(b). The results reveal that when the desorption temperature reaches 450 °C, NH3 is completely desorbed from the surface of Fe2O3/TiO2-HC and Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF catalysts, indicating that the desorption of NH3 at the reaction temperature did not impede the progress of the reaction. To investigate the adsorption state of NO on the catalyst surface, NO adsorption experiments were conducted on the Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF catalyst over a temperature range of 25–500 °C, and the results were analyzed using in situ infrared spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 3(c), vibration peaks at 1303 and 1240 cm–1, corresponding to M-O-NO2 and (M-O)2=NO species, respectively [27]. Interestingly, the peaks associated with M-O-NO2 (1303 cm–1) and (M-O)2=NO (1240 cm–1) disappear at 250 °C. At the same temperature, new peaks emerged at 1272 and 1388 cm–1, attributed to (M-O)2=NO and M-O-NO2 transforming into monodentate nitrite and free NO3 – [27]. Additionally, a peak at 1342 cm–1, attributed to N2O2 2–, appeared, indicating a strong reduction of nitrate or nitrite following NO adsorption on the Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF catalyst [28]. Vibration peaks corresponding to bidentate nitrate and monodentate nitrate on adsorbed Fe2+ were observed at 1610, 1832, and 1910 cm–1 [29–31]. The intensity of these peaks decreases with increasing temperature, but notably, the peaks at 1832 and 1910 cm–1 do not completely disappear, suggesting that monodentate and bidentate nitrates adsorbed onto Fe2+ are relatively stable [32]. The in situ DRIFT spectra of NO and H2 (NO:H2 = 1:5) co-adsorbed on the Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF catalyst are shown in Fig. 3(d). At low temperatures, peaks were observed at 1397, 1720 and 1810 cm–1, corresponding to monodentate nitrate and bidentate nitrate species adsorbed on Fe2+ [31,33,34]. As the temperature increased, the intensity of the peaks associated with monodentate nitrate (1397, 1720 cm–1) and bidentate nitrate (1810 cm–1) decreased. At 350 °C, peaks appeared at 3138 and 3042 cm–1, corresponding to ligand NH3, and at 1406 cm–1, corresponding to ion NH4 + adsorbed on Lewis and Brønsted acid sites, respectively [35]. To successfully hydrogenate NO to ammonia, a comprehensive understanding of the NO activation process after adsorption on the catalyst is crucial. Partial density of states (PDOS) analysis revealed that the d orbitals of the Fe atom and the p orbitals of the N atom play critical roles in this activation process, as depicted in Fig. 4(a) . During NO transition, the Fe atom facilitates the movement of the outer electrons of the N atom to higher energy levels. Hybridization near the Fermi level between the Fe d and N p orbitals indicates a strong N-Fe interaction—essential for effective adsorption—a pivotal first step in the hydrogenation of NO to ammonia. The chemical adsorption of NO on the Fe2O3/TiO2 surface is a fundamental prerequisite and material basis for ammonia synthesis. As shown in Fig. 4(c), during the NO adsorption process, the Fe2O3/TiO2 substrate transfers 0.3 e − to the gas molecules. The pink region observed between NO and Fe2O3/TiO2 highlights the electron accumulation in this area, indicating an increase in the electron density and strengthened interaction. For NO molecules, the electron density increases primarily at the end of the O atom, whereas the electron density at the N atom decreases, thereby weakening the NO bond and making NO easier to activate. Fig. 4(b) illustrates the adsorption of NH3 on the Fe2O3/TiO2 surface. In ammonia synthesis, the desorption and collection of NH3 pose significant challenges. Understanding the intrinsic mechanism of NH3 adsorption is crucial for studying its recovery and utilization. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the adsorption of NH3 on the Fe2O3/TiO2 surface is primarily due to the interaction between the Fe d and N p orbitals. Moreover, Fig. 4(d) shows that the electron density near the Fe atom increased, whereas it decreased near the N atom. According to Bader charge analysis, 0.9 e − is transferred to the Fe2O3/TiO2 surface, making NH3 more easily dissociated from the catalyst surface [36]. During the NO reduction process, a comprehensive simulation and optimization were conducted for the intermediates generated across all conceivable reaction pathways. Subsequently, the adsorption energy for the most stable configuration of each intermediate was calculated. Considering ammonia synthesis on the surface of the Fe2O3/TiO2 catalyst, the reduction of NO to ammonia is a spontaneous reaction governed by the following total reaction equation: (5) NO (g) + 5H+ + 5e− → NH3 (g) + H2O (g) However, determining whether NO is more likely to undergo dissociation (*NO → *N + *O) or hydrogenation (*NO + H+ e− → *HNO) on the Fe2O3/TiO2 surface remains crucial. Fig. 4(e) presents the calculated energy barriers associated with the dissociation of the adsorbed *NO into *N and *O, the hydrogenation of *NO into *HNO at the N-atomic end on the Fe2O3/TiO2 surface, and the dissociation of *HNO into *NO and *H. The energy barriers for these reactions are 4.5, 3.2, and 3.3 eV, respectively. These results suggest that the energy barrier for NO hydrogenation at the N-terminus of the Fe2O3/TiO2 surface is lower than that for NO dissociation. Consequently, NO hydrogenation was more energy-efficient and more stable on the Fe2O3/TiO2 surface. Once the initial hydrogenation step is established as feasible, the process continues with further hydrogenation of the O atom connected to *HNO, resulting in the formation of adsorbed *HNOH via an exothermic reaction [37,38]. The reaction pathways for the hydrogenation of NO to ammonia are illustrated in Figs. 5(a) –(c). Among the three reaction pathways considered, Path 1 was governed by the rate-determining step of *NO reacting with protons and electrons to form *NOH, that is *NO + H+ + e− → *NOH. In contrast, for Paths 2 and 3, the rate-limiting step involved the reaction of *NO with protons and electrons to yield *HNO, i.e., **NO + H+ + e− → *HNO. Path 1 differs from Path 2 in that the initial hydrogenation occurs at the O-atomic end of *NO, whereas Path 2 occurs at the N-atomic end. The distinction between Paths 2 and 3 lies in whether the second hydrogenation step of *HNOH occurs on the N or O atoms of *HNOH. For Path 1, the exothermic transformation from *NO to *NH3 is not entirely favorable. However, in Paths 2 and 3, the transformation is a fully spontaneous and exothermic process. Notably, in Paths 2 and 3, the second hydrogenation step favored the N-atomic end of *HNOH, leading to a more stable intermediate product that facilitated the spontaneous progression of the reaction. 4 Conclusions In summary, we successfully developed a novel Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF catalyst using a combination of hydrothermal and impregnation methods, significantly advancing the field of NO hydrogenation for NH3 synthesis. This catalyst demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a NO conversion of 99% and an NH3 selectivity of 95% at a reaction temperature of 450 °C. The experimental results highlighted the presence of abundant oxygen vacancies and a strong capacity for NO adsorption and activation in the Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF catalyst. DFT calculations were performed to understand the underlying catalytic mechanisms. These calculations identified the potential reaction pathways for the reduction of NO to ammonia. Specifically, in Path 1, the rate-determining step is the formation of *NOH via the reactions *NO + H+ + e− → *NOH. In contrast, in Paths 2 and 3, the rate-limiting step involved the formation of *HNO through the reactions *NO + H+ + e− and *HNO. These insights provide a novel and promising strategy for efficient NH3 production under favorable conditions. Future research efforts will focus on extending this catalytic reduction technology to a more challenging substrate, i.e., NO for ammonia synthesis.

        "dc:description": "Nitrogen oxides (NO x ) present in flue gas are economically renewable N1 resources. Unlike traditional selective catalytic reduction processes that convert NO into N2, redirecting NO towards the synthesis of value-added NH3 offers significant practical benefits. In this study, a Ti-based metal-organic framework (Ti-MOF), specifically MIL-125, was utilized as a support for Fe, which was subsequently calcined at 400 °C to produce a Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF catalyst. The resulting catalyst demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving 99% NO conversion and 95% NH3 selectivity under optimal conditions of 450 °C, 0.1 MPa, and a gas hourly space velocity of 38000 mL g–1 h−1. Additionally, the catalyst exhibited excellent stability and resistance to water and sulfur. The high efficiency of Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF is attributed to the abundance of Fe2+ sites at the reaction temperature, which enhances NO adsorption and activation. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations suggest that NO undergoes hydrogenation at the N-terminus on the Fe2O3/TiO2-MOF surface, leading directly to NH3 synthesis rather than dissociation followed by hydrogenation. This catalyst presents a novel approach for converting NO x into high-value chemical products.",
