BOSTELAAR and WOLFGANG M. H. SACHTLER* Gorlaeus Laboratoria, State University of Leiden, P.O. Box 9500, 2300 RA Leiden (The Netherlands) (Received January 5, 1984 [accepted March 26, 1984) Summary Influences of alkali halides on the catalysis of tartrate-modified nickel in the asymmetric hydrogenation of a prochiral keto compound have been studied. The effects are shown to be dependent on the concentration of these salts in the reaction mixture. At low concentrations of Na or K halides the selectivity is enhanced, but at higher concentrations it drops below the value found in the absence of alkali halides. The concentration required for the selectivity maximum is two orders of magnitude higher for NaBr than for Nal, in accordance with the much stronger adsorption of the latter, found by direct determination of the adsorbed quantities. For a given anion, the effects on the selectivity strongly depend on the nature of the cation. The results are rationalized tentatively by assuming that alkali ions, by coordination with tartrate and substrate oxygens, modify the stereochemistry of the product-determining surface complex. Introduction In the enantioselective hydrogenation of prochiral keto compounds over tartrate-modified nickel catalysts: 0 OH II Ni ^ CHa-C-CHzR + H; > CH3-C*-CH2R (R = -COOCHa or -CHpH) H it has been reported that the enantiomeric excess (here abbreviated as e.e.) is enhanced by adding inorganic salts to the modification solution [1, 2], *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed at: Chemistry Department, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60201, U.S.A. 0304-5102/84/$3.00 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 388 These salts are called 'co-modifiers' in this paper. The interpretations put forward differ, though all authors seem to agree that at least two kinds of sites are present on the catalyst, usually termed the 'selective' and the 'non- selective' sites. Harada et al. [3] assumed that the selectivity increase is caused by anions which preferentially block the non-selective sites. This model would imply that co-modification must always result in a lowering of the catalyst activity. Hoek et al. [4] argued that salts such as NaBr might alter the solubility product for sodium nickel tartrate complexes, shifting the equilibrium to lower solubility and, hence, a higher concentration of these complexes on the catalyst surface. As the complexes were assumed to be the enantioselective sites, it follows that the number of selective sites on the catalyst surface increases. In preliminary experiments with NaBr, we have found [5] that extensive washing of co-modified catalysts with methanol reduces the selectivity to the level of catalysts modified without co-modifiers. This observation suggests that the effects reported [3,4] are due to a reversible adsorption. We there- fore decided to study the effects of alkali halides present in situ in the hydrogenation mixture. The term co-modifier is used for materials present in the modification stage of catalyst preparation, whereas alkali halides present in the reaction mixture will be referred to as promoters. We consider the possibility that the halide, or one of its ions, affects the stereochemistry of the 'substrate-selective site' complex during the product-determining step. This concept is based on the assumption that the intrinsic selectivity of the selective sites can be less than 100%, and is subject to change in different chemical environments. As a variety of halide promoters led to remarkable differences in catalytic behaviour of the studied catalysts, a tentative explana- tion of the divergent roles of anions and cations will be presented. Experimental Catalyst preparation and modification An 11 wt.% Ni/SiOa catalyst was prepared and modified as described previously [5]. Impregnation of the large pore-diameter support (SiO;, Koninklijke/Shell Laboratorium, Amsterdam) with a ?(N03)2 solution (Baker, p.a.) was followed by decantation and drying for 16 h at 105 C. For each experiment (three different hydrogenations, two with and one without added promoter, vide infra) 3 g of the catalyst was reduced in a purified hydrogen flow of 200 ml min~1 at 400 C for 16 h. Modification was per- formed in 100 ml of a 2 wt.% aqueous solution of (R,R )-tartaric acid (Aldrich, Gold Label), brought to pH 5.0 with NaOH (Merck, p.a.), at 100 C for 2 h under air. After modification the catalyst was washed, once with 100 ml demineralized water (3 min) and three times with 50 ml methanol (Merck or Baker, p.a.) for 10 min. 389 Hydrogenation The liquid-phase hydrogenations were conducted as described previously [5]; after washing, portions of the catalyst were quickly transferred to three atmospheric batch reactors, which contained mixtures of 10 ml 50/50 (v/v) methyl acetoacetate (Fluka, p.a.) with methanol (Merck, p.a.). In two of the three reaction vessels, promoters were dissolved. LiBr (Merck, p.a.), NaBr (Baker, p.a.), RbBr (Fluka, purum), Nal (Baker, p.a.) and KI (Merck, p.a.) were used. Hydrogenations were performed at 50 C for 2 h. The catalysts were separated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation, and methanol, promoters and minor impurities (including some dissolved nickel tartrate complexes) were removed by distillation under reduced pressure. Analysis The determination of the compositions and optical rotations of the purified reaction mixtures was performed by GLC and polarimetry [5]; the optical yield of (.R)-methyl 3-hydroxybutyrate (MHB) was calculated according to the equation [1, 5]: e.e. = -aD- X 100% 22.95 After centrifugation the wet catalysts were dried for 16 h at 105 C and weighed. The X-ray powder diffraction patterns of different catalysts were measured with a Philips Goniometer PW 1050/25 with a PW Cu 2103/00 X-ray tube. Average metal particle sizes (d) were calculated from the half- width of the peaks of the (111) and the (200) planes of nickel metal, using the Scherrer equation [6] and Warren's correction for instrumental line broadening [7]. An estimation of the metal surface area per gram catalyst was made by averaging the metal particle sizes found, and, assuming spherical nickel particles, eqn. (1). 60 M S= dp (1) where S stands for the surface area (m2 g~1), M the metal load in wt.% (here 11), d the metal particle diameter (nm) and p the density of the metal in g cm\"3 (here: 8.90). Several procedures were tested to determine the amounts of Br~ or I~ adsorbed on the catalyst: (1) Decomposition of the Ni catalyst in HNC>3, followed by precipitation of the halide with AgNOs and back-titration of the Ag\"1\" with NH4SCN [3]. This method was found unreliable as the Ni solutions are colored; (2) Washing the wet catalyst with a liquid of high solubility for the halides. Obviously this method is unreliable if the halide is strongly adsorbed on the catalyst; and (3) Drying of the wet catalyst, followed by determination of the halide with X-ray fluorescence. An obvious shortcoming is that the quantity of halide 390 found in this way also includes the halide which was dissolved in the liquid present in the pores before drying the catalyst. The analytical result thus provides only an upper limit for the quantity of halide adsorbed on the cata- lyst surface prior to drying, and must be corrected for the quantity preci- pitated during drying; this correction requires knowledge of the concentration of the solute and an estimate of the pore volume of the catalyst. We have chosen to use the third method. X-ray fluorescence measure- ments were carried out using an Ortec 451 Spectroscopy Amplifier with americium241 as the source for gamma radiation. Mo and Dy were used as secondary targets forBr\" andl~ determinations respectively. The detector was lithium-doped silicon, while the data were processed by a multi-channel ana- lyzer, type Didac 800. Calculations were performed with the quotients of the Br or the I peaks and the Ni peaks of the various samples. For calibration pur- poses, following their X-ray fluorescence measurements some of the catalysts were washed with demineralized water in a Soxhiet apparatus, dried and mea- sured again. The amounts of washed-off Br~ or I~ were determined respectively by potentiometric titrations (Volhard) [8] using a Seibold Type GTC pH meter, or by polarography [9] using a PAR Model 174 Polarographic Ana- lyzer. Results As reported by others [10], experimental data on activity and selectivity measured in the absence of a promoter showed considerable scatter. The mean value of the e.e. for fifteen experiments was 42.7 (%), with a standard deviation of 3.5. The mean activity (in 10~6 mol s~\\ (g Ni)~1) was 152 26. The selectivity was enhanced by Nal, NaBr or KI promoters. These enhance- ments were concentration-dependent, as depicted in Fig. 1. For Nal and KI, a maximum followed by a sharp decrease to below the initial value (without added iodide) in selectivity was found. As reported earlier [5], for a 10 wt.% Ni/SiO; catalyst we observed a maximum also with NaBr. Upon further in- crease in the concentration of NaBr, the selectivity fell to below its initial value (without added NaBr). Likewise, e.e. values of 4 -10% have previously been observed [11] for NaBr concentrations as high as 0.3 0.1 mol 1~1 and a 12.5 wt.% Ni/SiO:; catalyst, whereas this catalyst displayed e.e. values of 31 - 35% [4] in the absence of NaBr. A selectivity maximum has also been reported by Murakami et al. [2] and Harada et at. [3] upon increasing con- centrations of NaBr as co-modifier, but in those cases no decrease below the e.e. of catalysts modified without NaBr was mentioned. With LiBr we found a negligible effect, and with RbBr a negative effect as selectivity promoter. It is striking that all effects on selectivity are observed with much lower con- centration for the iodides than for the bromides. The selectivity maximum for Nal, e.g. occurs near 10~3 mol 1~1, whereas for NaBr a concentration of 10~1 mol 1~1 is required to produce a shallow maximum. The same observa- tion has been made by other authors [1 - 3 ], i.e. that the co-modifier effects 391 e.e. (%) \"LOG(CONC. SALT) Fig. 1.

Hydrogenation activity in the presence of dissolved alkali halides (symbols as in Fig. 1). of iodides are always observed with much lower salt concentrations in the modifying solution than those of the bromides. All promoted catalysts with the exception of those promoted with NaBr displayed a decreased activity, as shown in Fig. 2. For the NaBr-promoted catalysts, the activity was apparently concentration-independent in the region of our measurements, but for higher NaBr concentrations (and low e.e. values) the activity was also found to decrease.

The mean Ni particle size, an average of the particle sizes found for eight different catalysts used (promoted as well as non-promoted), amounted to 14.5 1.5 nm. With eqn. (1), the Ni surface area per gram catalyst was calculated to be 5.1 m2. Assuming a cross- sectional area of 0.065 nm2 for a surface nickel atom [12], the number of exposed atoms per gram catalyst is 78 X 1018 (13 X 10-5 mol). The quantities of promoter in (a) the liquid reaction mixture and (b) the dried catalyst, as found by X-ray fluorescence, are given in Table 1. In order to estimate the amount of promoter adsorbed on the catalyst surface, the latter value should be corrected for the halide dissolved in the liquid filling the pores of the wet catalyst. As the pore volume is on the order of a few tenths of a ml, it appears that this correction would become very large for the bromide promoter. As mentioned above, this promoter showed effects on the e.e. only at rather high concentrations, and under these conditions virtually all halide detected by X-ray fluorescence could be attributed to the dissolved salt of the wet catalyst. The adsorbed quantity on the catalyst surface is thus within exper- imental error. This weak adsorption agrees with the high concentration requirement and the ease with which the co-modifier effects of NaBr could be destroyed by washing, as mentioned above. For the iodides, a different picture emerges. The quantity of dissolved iodide in the pore liquid is much smaller than the quantity detected; we must thus conclude that adsorption of iodide by the catalyst is appreciable. This is in good agreement with the low concentration requirement to achieve the selectivity maximum and also with the significant poisoning effect of iodine at concentrations where any effects of the bromides are still below our limit of detection. Assuming that for the iodides the quantity detected on the 393 dried catalyst was virtually completely adsorbed on the Ni before drying, it is of interest to relate the number of r ions to the number of exposed Ni atoms. This ratio, derived from the ratio of the corresponding X-ray fluores- cence peaks, is given in the third column of Table 1. Accepting the assump- tions made, it appears that the maximum in selectivity is obtained at a coverage of 3.5 I\" ions per 100 surface Ni atoms. Though this result cannot claim a high degree of accuracy, it gives for the first time an impression of the population of the catalyst surface with promoter or co-modifier, respon- sible for the selectivity enhancement. Discussion The e.e. values found for unpromoted catalysts do not differ much from those reported for tartaric acid-modified Raney nickel [1, 10] or Ni/ Si02 [3, 13] catalysts. Changes in selectivity and/or activity caused by promoting the catalyst with bromides or iodides are outside the experimental scatter. For the NaBr-promoted catalysts, the activity change is insignificant for the concentrations of interest, whereas for the LiBr promoted catalysts, no change of any significance in selectivity is observed. The enhancement of the e.e., up to 60% as found here, is less pronounced than the reported value of 80% for Raney nickel catalysts [1, 3]. The latter result was obtained at higher temperature, higher hydrogen pressure, and higher conversion level. The reduction of the e.e. found in the present work at high concentrations of Nal, KI and NaBr has, to our knowledge, not been reported before. These reductions were accompanied by drastic activity decreases. Remarkable, too, is that the enhancements of the selectivity occur at low concentration of adsorbed halide. For the iodides the activity vanishes at a surface coverage I/Nis of only ~ 0.035. Even if the larger diameter of the I\" ion is taken into account, it follows that only a small fraction of the metal surface is active under the prevailing reaction conditions. Two models must be considered for the promoter effects: (1) a prefer- ential blocking of certain reaction sites by anions; and (2) a change in the stereochemistry of the 'substrate-selective site' surface complex by either cations or anions. The models are not mutually exclusive, but the present data provide some basis for a discussion of apparently prevailing effects. The simple model that halide anions preferentially block non-selective sites is evidently insufficient to rationalize the data in view of three results: (a) for NaBr a marked enhancement of selectivity is observed, while the activity stays virtually constant; (b) with LiBr no selectivity enhancement takes place at promoter concentrations which are sufficient to decrease the activity; (c) for iodides and for NaBr, a decrease in e.e. is found at high promoter concentrations, indicating a preferential blocking of selective, rather than of non-selective sites. We therefore feel that stereochemical interactions of promoter ions with the asymmetric sites must be considered. This does not, of course, com- 394 pletely exclude the possibility that site-blocking by anions, which may affect selective and non-selective sites in a different manner, will also take place to some extent. Further considerations, such as how the sites are sterically influenced by adsorption of ions, are speculative at this stage. There is evidence that the corrosive interaction of tartaric acid with the nickel metal leads to the for- mation of nickel tartrate, a compound which we found to crystallize in a lattice of somewhat corrugated layers [14]. One might assume that similar tartrate layers cover parts of the surface of modified nickel catalysts; the selective sites could then be located on the edges and corners of such nickel tartrate sheets. Further, there is a wide consensus that H bond bridges be- tween adsorbed tartrate and the reactant are of importance, as was shown in particular by Yasumori [15]. It seems conceivable that (solvent) coordinated alkali ions will become associated to oxygen donor atoms of adsorbed tartrate and reactant molecules. It may be significant that an enhancement of the enantioselectivity is found for those alkali ions which are known to become octahedrally coordinated [16], i.e. Na\"*\" and K\"1\", while Rb'1\", which is known to prefer a nine-fold coordination with oxygen [16], exerts an effect of the opposite sign. Li\"*\", with a favoured tetrahedral or tetragonal pyramidal coordination [16] with oxygen donor atoms, appears to have no effect. The amount of the adsorbed alkali ion appears to be controlled to a large extent by the anion, since electroneutrality must be maintained. Since I\" is adsorbed more strongly than Br~, as the present results show, the con- centration of alkali ions on the surface will be correspondingly higher for alkali iodides than for bromides. Our finding, that comparable surface con- centrations become established for Br~ and I~ only if their concentrations in the solution differ by two orders of magnitude, will also be valid for the cations neutralizing these halide ions. It therefore appears conceivable that the stereochemistry of the 'nickel tartrate-substrate' complexes on the surface is modified by complexation of the oxygen atoms with alkali cations, the surface concentration of the latter being controlled by the adsorption of the halide ions. The specific effects of individual cations are tentatively correlated with the preferential geometry of their oxygen complexes. Acknowledgements The authors are indebted to Dr. W. van Bennekom and M.

        "dc:description": "Influences of alkali halides on the catalysis of tartrate-modified nickel in the asymmetric hydrogenation of a prochiral keto compound have been studied. The effects are shown to be dependent on the concentration of these salts in the reaction mixture. At low concentrations of Na or K halides the selectivity is enhanced, but at higher concentrations it drops below the value found in the absence of alkali halides. The concentration required for the selectivity maximum is two orders of magnitude higher for NaBr than for NaI, in accordance with the much stronger adsorption of the latter, found by direct determination of the adsorbed quantities. For a given anion, the effects on the selectivity strongly depend on the nature of the cation. The results are rationalized tentatively by assuming that alkali ions, by coordination with tartrate and substrate oxygens, modify the stereochemistry of the product-determining surface complex.",
