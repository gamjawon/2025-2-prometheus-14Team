Graphical abstract The depolymerization reaction of Protobind lignin (PL) was conducted over metal supported on ZSM-5 catalysts in supercritical ethanol without supplying additional hydrogen in order to obtain the high yield of monoaromatic compounds. The reaction was performed by changing the various variables of catalyst such as the types of transition metals (Co, Ni and Cu), the amount of metal loading (5wt.%, 10wt.% and 30wt.% of Cu) and the Si/Al2 ratio of ZSM-5 (30, 50, 80 and 200). Cu/ZSM-5 displayed the highest yield of monoaromatic compounds among the transition metals. When it comes to the Si/Al2 ratio of Cu/ZSM-5, 10wt.% Cu/ZSM-5 with Si/Al2 of 30 demonstrated the highest yield (98.2wt.%) of monoaromatic compounds. Moreover, the linear correlation between yield of monoaromatic compound and acid density of Cu/ZSM-5 was identified. Meanwhile, HSQC NMR analysis provided the evidence about the promotion of the depolymerization of Protobind lignin via hydrogenolysis. In addition, some products such as ethylated compounds were confirmed by HSQC NMR spectra resulting from the alkylation between monoaromatic compounds and ethanol. It was also found that Cu metal plays a promotional role in enhancing the lignin depolymerization. Keywords Protobind lignin Supercritical ethanol In-situ hydrogen Cu/ZSM-5 Acid density 1 Introduction Lignocellulosic biomass is regarded as an attractive alternative feedstock to fossil fuels to enable sustainable society [1,2]. Especially, lignin consists of three major phenylpropane units, (guaiacyl alcohol, syringyl alcohol and p-coumaryl alcohol) which are linked by CC and CO bonds [3,4]. Because of such unique structure, lignin has the potential to replace the fossil resources in the near future because it can produce value-added chemicals by cleaving CO bonds. In order to depolymerize and deoxygenate lignin effectively, various thermochemical approaches such as hydrogenolysis, gasification, liquefaction and catalytic cracking have been widely used [5–9]. Especially, liquefaction using alcohol solvents such as methanol and ethanol as reaction medium is considered as a promising method for lignin depolymerization because it is able to depolymerize and/or deoxygenate without supplying any external hydrogen [10–13]. Supercritical ethanol has several advantages. At first, supercritical ethanol as a solvent has fine solubility because its dielectric constant is low at not only supercritical condition, but also ambient condition; it is about 25 at ambient condition. According to this reason, products dissolved in ethanol can be maintained without segregation or condensation at ambient condition after the reaction. Secondly, for the reason mentioned above, produced bio-oil can form a single liquid phase and can be recovered from ethanol more easily [14]. Also, lignin typically contains a large number of hydroxyl groups, which is highly reactive, is likely to be repolymerized during the reaction. However, supercritical ethanol generating in-situ hydrogen acts as nucleophile to alkylate the hydroxyl group and prevent repolymerization [15]. As a result, supercritical ethanol shows higher yield than other supercritical solvents such as supercritical carbon dioxide or supercritical water. For example, in case of supercritical water, its dielectric constant is about 80 at ambient condition. Hence, liquid products tend to be segregated from the solvent and are condensed. Meanwhile, the combination of catalysts with supercritical ethanol is inevitable since catalyst is able to selectively cleave CO bonds in lignin [16–18]. In current work, we applied zeolite to the catalytic lignin depolymerization in supercritical ethanol because of unique porous structure, controllable acidity and ability to confine active metal species [19–21]. Especially, ZSM-5 zeolites having unique shape selectivity are suitable for aromatization and cracking reaction because they have ideal pore size and acidity for the reaction [22,23]. Due to such several advantages, various researches by using ZSM-5 have been widely reported. Singh and Ekhe have claimed that HZSM-5 and Ni doped HZSM-5 catalysts are efficient for hydrodeoxygenation of lignin [24]. Milovanović et al. have reported on the depolymerization of various lignin by using NiO/HZSM-5 [25]. Mullen et al. have demonstrated the role of potassium ion in ZSM-5 for biomass conversion [26]. However, even though many researches have used ZSM-5 for lignin depolymerization, the yield of monoaromatic compounds is still not high enough. Therefore, acquiring the high yield of monoaromatic compounds by finding the optimum catalyst is one of the important challenges. In this respect, the aim of the work is to increase the yield of monoaromatic compounds by depolymerizing Protobind lignin in supercritical ethanol over ZSM-5-supported catalysts. Various parameters such as catalysts, temperature and time were investigated. In addition, the types of transition metals, the loading of metal and the Si/Al2 ratio of ZSM-5 were also explored to find the optimum reaction condition to produce monoaromatic compounds. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and chemicals Protobind 1000 alkali lignin (PL) was supplied from Eindhoven University. PL was produced from wheat straw (sulfur-free lignin with less than 4wt.% carbohydrates and less than 2wt.% ash) by using soda pulping process [27]. For catalyst synthesis, Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Co(NO3)2·6H2O, were purchased from Alfa Aesar. In case of catalytic support material, the commercial NH4 form ZSM-5 zeolites were purchased from Alfa Aesar: (Si/Al2 =30, 50, 80 and 200). Ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, 200 proof, ACS reagent, ≥99.5%) was chosen as a reaction medium for depolymerization of lignin in supercritical condition. Tetrahydrofuran (Reagent Plus ≥99.0%, stabilized with butylated hydroxytoluene) and deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 (containing TMS) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich for the post-treatment of liquid products and NMR analysis, respectively. 2.2 Catalysts preparation The commercial NH4 ZSM-5 was used after calcination at 550°C for 3h to induce H ZSM-5 form. All catalysts were synthesized by applying wet impregnation method. Metal precursor was dissolved in deionized water and the solution was put into support material and stirred at room temperature for 30min. Metal was impregnated onto each support by using a rotary evaporator, and then the catalyst was dried in an oven overnight. All prepared catalysts were calcined in a muffle furnace at 500°C (Co catalyst) and 460°C (Cu and Ni catalysts) for 2h, respectively. Prior to reaction, the calcined catalysts were reduced at the same condition in 15% H2/N2 flow. The reduced catalyst was designated as X wt.% M/ZSM-5(ratio); X=loading of the metal, M=transition metal, ZSM-5 (ratio=30, 50, 80 and 200). 2.3 Characterization Inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) was used (SHIMADZU/ICPE-9000) to confirm the metal contents (Si, Al, and Cu) of prepared catalysts. The samples were analyzed by using acid digestion (aqua regia and perchloric acid). Physical properties of the catalysts were analyzed by using N2 physisorption apparatus (Micrometritics ASAP 2010) at constant temperature (77K). Prior to analysis, all samples were pretreated at 250°C for at least 4h under vacuum condition. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted on a high power X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Corp.) using Cu Kα as a radiation source at 40kV and 30mA. The scan step was fixed as 0.02° in the range of 10–90°. NH3 temperature programmed desorption (TPD) was carried out by using BEL CAT II (JAPAN). Prior to the analysis, 0.03g of sample was heated at 300°C for 1h under a He flow to get rid of adsorbed impurities. After cooling to 60°C, the sample was saturated with 4.96% NH3/He. The physisorbed NH3 was removed by purging of He flow at 100°C. After the sample was cooled down to 60°C and the TCD signal was stabilized, the TCD signal was recorded with increasing the temperature from 60°C to 550°C at a rate of 10°C/min under a flow of He. The surface morphology of as-reduced catalysts was investigated by using FE-SEM (field emission-scanning electron microscopy, MERLIN compact, ZEISS). HSQC (heteronuclear signal quantum coherence) analysis was conducted by using 850MHz Cryo NMR (AVNACE III HC, Bruker, German). Raw Protobind lignin and THF-soluble lignin were dried at 105°C in an oven overnight and dissolved in 900μL of deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide d6 prior to HSQC-NMR analysis. 2.4 Experimental setup and procedure The catalytic depolymerization of lignin was conducted in a 50mL stainless-steel high pressure autoclave. The reactor was filled with 0.5g of Protobind lignin in 25mL ethanol. 0.3g of sieved catalyst (425μm–600μm) was loaded into the designed stainless-steel basket with 500mesh. 0.0013g of fluoranthene as an internal standard was also added into the reactor. The reactor was sealed and purged with nitrogen several times to get rid of oxygen. Prior to the reaction, 10bar nitrogen at room temperature was pressurized into the reactor. Then, the reaction mixture was heated to 440°C (12°C/min) for 5h while stirring at 500rpm. After the reaction, the reactor was rapidly quenched below 130°C by using an ice water bath. The yield (Y) of monoaromatic compounds was calculated by following equations: Y ( wt . % ) = weight of monoaromatic compounds ( quantified by GC − FID ) weight of ash free lignin × 100 2.5 Product analysis GC–MS (Agilent 6890N, DB-5ms, 30m×0.25mm×0.25μm) and GC-FID (Agilent 6890A, DB-5, 60m×0.25mm×0.25μm) analysis of liquid product was conducted without any dilution. Fluoranthene was used as an internal standard (ISTD). The injector and detector temperatures were 310°C and 320°C, respectively. The initial oven temperature of the GC was 50°C for 5min and the temperature increased up to 90°C at 10°C/min, followed by an increase up to 130°C (1°C/min), 220°C (5°C/min) and 325°C (10°C/min) for 10min. The gaseous product was analyzed with GC to quantify H2. GC-TCD (Agilent 6890N, Carboxen 1000, 30m×0.53mm×0.25μm) was used for analysis. The initial oven temperature was 35°C for 2min and the oven was heated to 250°C at a rate of 10°C/min for 1min. The injector temperature was 183°C and the detector temperature was 250°C. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 ZSM-5-supported catalysts for lignin depolymerization Lignin depolymerization reaction was performed over both without catalyst (blank reaction) and ZSM-5 supported catalysts in supercritical ethanol at 440°C for 5h. The total yield of monoaromatic compounds is acquired by adding up the each yield of 12 monoaromatic compounds including phenol, toluene, m-xylene, benzyl alcohol, 2-ethylphenol, ethylbenzene, guaiacol, syringol, o-cresol, 4-ethylphenol, benzaldehyde and 1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene. Table 1 exhibits the yield of monoaromatic compounds quantified by using GC-FID. In case of the blank reaction, the yield of monoaromatic compounds is 5.0wt.% (Entry 1). Meanwhile, the yield of monoaromatic compounds over ZSM-5 supported catalysts is shown in Table 1 as well. At first, among various transition metals (Ni, Co and Cu) supported on ZSM-5(200), 10wt.% Cu/ZSM-5(200) shows the highest yield (15.3wt.%) of monoaromatic compounds. Because the optimum metal is considered as Cu, the loading of Cu onto the ZSM-5(200) is varied from 5wt.% to 30wt.%. (Table 1, Entry 4 and 5). Consequently, the maximum yield of monoaromatic compounds is obtained by applying Cu/ZSM-5(200) with Cu loading of 10wt.%. This result indicates that the presence of the catalyst clearly enhances monoaromatic yield. Finally, the Si/Al2 ratio of ZSM-5 was varied from 30 to 200, while the loading of Cu was fixed as 10wt.%. By changing the Si/Al2 ratio of ZSM-5, the yield of monoaromatic compounds drastically increases (Table 1, Entry 7–10). The highest yield of monoaromatic compounds is obtained over 10wt.% Cu/ZSM-5(30) as 98.2wt.% among the catalysts. Besides ZSM-5(30)-supported catalyst, 10wt.% Cu/ZSM-5(50) and 10wt.% Cu/ZSM(80) also exhibit the relatively high yield of monoaromatic compounds (84.9wt.% and 39.5wt.%, respectively). Therefore, in order to elucidate the result, in-depth analysis over the 10wt.% Cu/ZSM-5 as a function of the Si/Al2 ratio were performed. Fig. 1 displays the distributions of monoaromatic compounds identified and quantified by GC–MS and GC-FID analysis over the catalysts. Benzaldehyde, ethylbenzene, m-xylene and toluene are mainly produced from the depolymerization of Protobind lignin. By decreasing the Si/Al2 ratio, the amount of monoaromatic compounds gradually increases, which is well related to the yield of monoaromatic compounds. Meanwhile, HSQC NMR analysis was performed to observe the changes in the chemical bonds of raw lignin and THF-soluble lignin after the lignin depolymerization reaction. In the side-chain region (Fig. 2 (A)), methoxy (OCH3), β-O-4 linkage (A), ββ linkage (B) and β-5 linkage (C) are clearly observed in Protobind lignin. By 13C 1H correlation for α, β and γ positions, the presence of β-O-4 marked with (A) is identified. The 13C-1H correlation in resinol substructures is displayed for ββ (B) and that phenylcoumarane substructures is shown for β-5 (C). In addition, ρ-hydroxylcinnamyl alcohol end-groups (I) and β-d-xylopyranoside are also observed. The observation of the latter implies the formation or the presence of furan compounds [27,28]. Meanwhile, in the aromatic region (Fig. 2(B)), etherified syringyl units (S), oxidized (Cα O) syringyl units (S′), guaiacyl units (G), ferulate (FA), ρ-hydroxyphenyl units (H) and ρ-coumarate (ρCA) are observed in raw Protobind lignin. This result is consistent with the previous report [27,29]. After lignin depolymerization reaction, all the signals observed in the aromatic region completely disappear in the THF-soluble lignin over 10wt.% Cu/ZSM-5(30) catalysts (not shown). It indicates that during the reaction, S, S’. G, FA, H and ρCA units in Protobind lignin are decomposed, resulting in the production of monoaromatic compounds. Meanwhile, in the side-chain region, a few signals are observed in the THF-soluble lignin over 10wt.% Cu/ZSM-5(30) (Fig. 3 ). The methoxy signal decreases significantly compared with raw Protobind lignin (Fig. 2(A)). The decrement of the signal corresponding to methoxy means that the hydrogenolysis reaction occurs over the catalysts, which is consistent with previous work [15,27]. The products containing ethyl groups are also identified by HSQC NMR as evidenced by the signal concerning ethylated products marked with an asterisk (*) in Fig. 3. This result means that ethylation between monoaromatic compounds and ethanol occurs during the reaction. Indeed, ethylated products such as 2-ethylphenol, o-cresol and ethylbenzene are also detected by GC in the liquid product. Meanwhile, in order to confirm the role of Cu, lignin depolymerization was conducted in the same condition by using Cu-free catalyst, ZSM-5(30). As a result, the yield of monoaromatic compounds is 89.4wt.% (Table 1, Entry 6), which is lower than that of 10wt.% Cu/ZSM-5(30). Based on the result, it can be speculated that lignin depolymerization mainly occurs over ZSM-5(30) which has the highest acidity. Meanwhile, by adding Cu metal onto ZSM-5(30) support, the yield slightly increases. It means that Cu metal plays a certain role in promoting the depolymerization of lignin. We can suggest that hydrogen atom could be adsorbed onto the surface of Cu metal which leads to the cleavage of ether bonds in lignin. Indeed, similar observation was found in previous research [28]. 3.2 Physical properties of 10wt.% Cu/ZSM-5(ratio) catalysts As shown in Table 2 , the difference in the amount of the Cu loading between the experimental value and the theoretical value exists. However, the experimental values over the Cu loading among the samples are almost identical from 7.26% to 7.54%. Meanwhile, the experimental values of the Si/Al2 ratio of ZSM-5 is slightly larger than the theoretical values. All catalysts have almost similar BET surface area between 331m2/g to 365m2/g, expect for 10wt.% Cu/ZSM-5(80), which has the largest BET surface area as 426m2/g. However, the BET surface area is not related to the catalytic activity. Meanwhile, by increasing the Si/Al2 ratio of ZSM-5, the external surface area increases from 98m2/g to 237m2/g. In the results of XRD analysis (Fig. 4 ), the patterns of XRD assigned to ZSM-5 are displayed in all catalysts, indicating that even after Cu loading, the structure of ZSM-5 is well maintained. In addition, the patterns of XRD corresponding to Cu metal (43° and 51°) are also observed in all catalysts. Meanwhile, when the particle size of Cu of the catalysts is compared (not shown), there is not much difference in the particle size of Cu depending on Cu/ZSM-5 samples with the various Si/Al2 ratios; the particle size of Cu at 43° is between 41.3nm and 51.1nm (the error range is about ±10%). In order to understand the morphology of the catalysts, SEM analysis was conducted and the SEM micrographs show in Fig. 5 . By varying the Si/Al2 ratio of ZSM-5, the morphology of the catalysts is remarkably changed. In case of low Si/Al2 ratios such as 30 and 50, the particles demonstrate nearly cubic and/or schistose morphology (irregular morphology) with the particle size of about 200nm, whereas the particles have spherical morphology with the size of >1μm in case of high Si/Al2 ratios (80 and 200). Based on the result, it can be summarized that the morphology and the particle size of the catalysts are considerably different by changing the Si/Al2 ratio in Cu/ZSM-5 [30]. 3.3 Acidic properties of 10wt.% Cu/ZSM-5(ratio) catalysts In order to investigate the acidic properties of the catalysts, NH3-TPD was conducted and the spectra are displayed in Fig. 6 . Two main desorption peaks are observed in the catalysts. The first peak below 350°C is attributed to the weak acid sites of the catalysts, while the second peak above 350°C originates from the strong acid sites [31,32]. The amount of acid sites in the high temperature region is determined, which is normalized by external surface area since lignin is expected to access only to the external surface of Cu/ZSM-5 (Table 3 ). The acid density (mmol/m2) of the catalysts increases by decreasing the Si/Al2 ratio from 200 to 30; the order is followed by 10wt.% Cu/ZSM-5(30): 3.2mmol/m2 >10wt.% Cu/ZSM-5 (50): 2.5mmol/m2 >10wt.% Cu/ZSM-5(80): 1.8mmol/m2 >10wt.% Cu/ZSM-5(200): 0.6mmol/m2. According to the previous research, the acidity increases with decreasing the Si/Al2 ratio due to the increment of not only extra-framework aluminum content but also in the framework, which was consistent with previous work [33]. Fig. 7 demonstrates the relationship between yield of monoaromatic compounds and acid density of 10wt.% Cu/ZSM-5 as a function of the Si/Al2 ratio catalysts. The yield of monoaromatic compounds and the acid density data were taken from Tables 1 and 3, respectively. The yield of monoaromatic compounds increases with increasing the acid density of the catalysts. Among the catalysts, 10wt.% Cu/ZSM-5(30) shows the highest acid density (3.2mmol/m2), resulting in the highest yield of monoaromatic compounds. It can be concluded that the acid density of Cu/ZSM-5 plays a crucial role in promoting the depolymerization of lignin in supercritical ethanol. 4 Conclusions The lignin depolymerization of Protobind lignin (PL) was performed over ZSM-5 supported catalysts in supercritical ethanol without supplying extra hydrogen. Various variables such as the types of transition metals (Co, Ni and Cu), the amount of metal loading (5wt.%, 10wt.% and 30wt.% of Cu) and the Si/Al2 ratio (30, 50, 80 and 200) were explored for lignin depolymerization at 440°C for 5h in supercritical ethanol. As a result, 10wt.% Cu/ZSM-5(30) showed the highest yield of monoaromatic compounds of 98.2wt.%. In addition, the linear correlation between yield of monoaromatic compounds and the acid density of Cu/ZSM-5 with various the Si/Al2 ratios was obtained. It can be explained by the fact that with decreasing the Si/Al2 ratio, the aluminum content of extra-framework increased, leading to the increment of the acidity of the catalyst. Consequently, the yield of monoaromatic compounds increased. Meanwhile, it was found that the presence of Cu on the ZSM-5 enhanced the lignin depolymerization.
