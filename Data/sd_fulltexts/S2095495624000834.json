Keywords Advanced aqueous batteries Aqueous electrolyte Recycling Recycling process discussion 1 Introduction Battery technology, serving as a basis for a rechargeable society, has developed rapidly over a century [1]. The progress can be roughly divided into three stages, with the initial two mainly focusing on aqueous battery systems. Prior to 1859, research primarily focused on the conceptualization of batteries and the development of primary (non-rechargeable) cells [2]. In the subsequent 150 years, rechargeable battery technology emerged, with the challenge being how to enhance energy density to meet the demands for practical applications. Since 2010, as battery technology significantly improved, people began to pay more widespread attention to other aspects of batteries, leading to the rapid development of various types of secondary batteries aimed at addressing these concerns [3]. The earliest association with battery technology may date back to the Parthian Empire era. By 1799, Alessandro Volta had discovered the Voltaic pile, a device employing zinc and copper plates as electrodes, inorganic salt solution as the electrolyte, and paper as a separator [2]. Over the following three years, this battery was optimized for several simple applications. Then, in 1859, Gaston Plante invented the rechargeable lead-acid battery, which utilized lead and lead dioxide electrodes and sulfuric acid solution as the electrolyte. Despite its low energy density, it captured a significant market share owing to its cost-effectiveness and well-established recycling system. Forty years after the invention of the lead-acid battery, Ernst Waldemar Jungner invented the alkaline battery (nickel-cadmium battery, Ni-Cd), using nickel and cadmium electrodes with a NaOH solution as the electrolyte. Over the next seventy years, Ni-Cd batteries improved and became different types, such as nickel-iron (Ni-Fe) and nickel-metal-hydride (Ni-MH) batteries; however, these faced significant practicality challenges for applications. It was not until 1977 when Stanley Whittingham invented the lithium metal battery, laying the basis for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) [4]. Over the next 14 years, the materials for LIBs experienced significant advancement and in 1991, Sony commercialized and introduced them to the market. However, as products became more widely available, safety concerns became more important. Especially after 2010, with LIBs dominating the consumer electronics market and experiencing a surge in applications in the electric vehicle and energy storage system, the related safety and environmental impact concerns were widely reported [5]. This has been resulted in the revisit and further development of aqueous batteries, known for their environmental friendliness and safety. According to the data from Web of Science in 2022, nearly 2,500 papers were published on aqueous batteries. Water’s abundance, harmlessness, and low cost make it an ideal solvent for electrolytes and a key element in the pursuit of sustainable battery technology development. Compared to LIBs that utilize organic carbonate solvents, the potential environmental impact of producing advanced aqueous batteries can be reduced by at least 40% [6]. Besides the environmental benefits, water’s non-flammability and excellent flame-retardant properties contribute to enhancing the safety level of battery products. In contrast, the non-aqueous electrolytes used in LIBs, mainly comprising carbonate solvents and LiPF6, require synthesis under strict conditions and pose high risks of flammability and decomposition during storage and use. The resulting safety hazards, once triggered, not only carry the risk of combustion but may also cause the fire to spread owing to contact between the electrolyte and the air [7]. For advanced aqueous batteries, even in the case of safety incidents, the potential energy release and consequences of safety accidents can be significantly mitigated. Therefore, it is anticipated that advanced aqueous batteries will see increased adoption in high-safety requirement applications, such as electric vehicles and energy storage systems in the coming years [8]. With ongoing technological advancements and the continual development of new materials, these batteries are rapidly approaching the energy density levels of commercial LIBs. However, even as advanced aqueous batteries offer superior environmental friendliness compared to traditional LIBs, the proper disposal of their increasing numbers of spent batteries should be considered. Accordingly, plans for recycling retired advanced aqueous batteries should be made in advance. This perspective first discusses the developmental history and material systems of advanced aqueous batteries, comparing their recyclability from a material regeneration and element extraction perspective. The paper further analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of recycling different aqueous batteries, proposing insights and recommendations aimed at guiding advanced aqueous batteries towards truly green and sustainable development throughout their lifecycle. 2 Introduction of advanced aqueous batteries Advanced aqueous batteries are a cutting-edge class of energy storage technologies that can be categorized into three main types based on the nature of the active ions used: Alkali metal batteries primarily utilize alkali metals such as lithium (Li+), sodium (Na+), and potassium (K+) as active ions [9–11]; Multivalent metal ion batteries use multivalent metal ions such as zinc (Zn2+), calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), and aluminum (Al3+) as active ions [12–15]; Non-metal ion batteries use protons (H+), hydroxide ions (OH–), ammonium ions (NH4 +), fluoride ions (F−), and chloride ions (Cl−) as active ions [16–18]. Each type has its own advantages in terms of safety, cost, availability of raw materials, and power density. For example, multitivalent metal batteries are generally abundant in the Earth’s crust, except zinc in zinc-based batteries, which is nearly as scared as lithium [19]. The other types of active ions are essentially in limitless supply in the crust. Both multivalent metal ion batteries and non-metal ion batteries, owing to their multi-electron redox mechanisms and high ionic conductivity, demonstrate rapid charging and discharging capabilities. Besides, these active ions based aqueous metal–oxygen batteries have been developing. Although advanced aqueous batteries may employ the manufacturing processes of LIBs in their production, their material composition will be significantly different owing to the unique properties of aqueous electrolytes and active ions (Table 1 ). For cathode materials, alkali metal batteries may still utilize commercialized cathode materials, in combination with metal oxides, polyanion materials, Prussian blue analogs, and organic materials, to achieve optimized performance [20–23]. Multivalent metal ion batteries and non-metal ion batteries will also utilize a similar range of materials. Regarding anode materials, alkali metals, with their high reactivity and vigorous response to water, tend to use metal oxides and organic materials. Multivalent metal ion batteries, in pursuit of higher energy densities, may shift towards using metal anodes in the future. Non-metal ion batteries are still in the initial stages of research and their material systems are not fully clarified, but future materials will still fall within these material categories mentioned above [24–26]. The electrolytes in aqueous batteries can be categorized into high-concentration and conventional-concentration electrolytes, depending on the battery system used. For instance, alkali metal batteries generally use high-concentration electrolytes to reduce the activity of water and increase the operational voltage of the battery. For separator choices, glass fiber with good wettability to aqueous electrolytes and solid polymer electrolytes are often used in the experimental stage, while modified polypropylene membranes may be prioritized for commercialization to meet energy density and safety requirements. Current collectors consider the corrosive nature of aqueous electrolytes, utilizing various types of metal foils (such as nickel, titanium, iron, aluminum, and copper) and carbon cloth or membrane. The shell material tends to favor stable aluminum plastic film and metals. Binders and conductive agents are likely to continue using polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and carbon nanomaterials, considering performance and production costs. 3 Aqueous batteries recycling The battery recycling process begins with remaining capacity assessment of spent batteries (Fig. 1 a). After screening and regrouping these spent batteries based on performance, they can either be employed for echelon utilization or sent directly for recycling. Echelon utilization involves the repurposing of battery packs, modules, and individual cells. Batteries not suitable for echelon utilization are put through direct recycling processes. Currently, battery recycling mainly employs two strategies: The pulverization method and the disassembling method (Fig. 1b). Both aim to recover materials from the batteries, allowing for the subsequent regeneration, element extraction, upcycling, and other potential applications (Fig. 1c). The recycling of traditional aqueous batteries, such as lead-acid, alkaline, and Zn-carbon batteries, involves battery pulverization, physical separation of metals, plastics, and electrolytes, and subsequent electrode material treatment. In the case of lead-acid battery electrolytes, plastic shell, and glass fiber separator are easily separated during the pulverization stage [27]. The remaining lead constituents are repurposed with high efficacy, commonly achieving a recovery rate of nearly 99% through Pyro method. The recovery rates for materials within lead-acid batteries, except glass fiber separator, approach theoretical maximums. Alkaline and zinc-carbon batteries, evolved to rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion batteries, utilize analogous recycling methods, though their material separation processes, which include screening, magnetic differentiation, and air separation, are notably complex. In their residual black mass, a mixture of carbon materials, zinc, manganese oxides, and about eight contaminants is found. Pyrolyzing black mass demands temperatures between 1100–1300 °C for zinc vaporization while manganese is recovered by acid leaching. The Hydro approach is suitable for the element extraction from the black mass owing to low consumption and high efficiency [28]. The current market battery recycling focuses on the LIB reprocessing. Despite the commercialized LIBs are non-aqueous, similarities in battery architecture, material composition, and proportional distribution with advanced aqueous batteries result in a convergence of recycling methodologies (Fig. 1b). As our previous publications have showed the strategies and methods for rechargeable ion battery recycling [19], we will focus on the analysis of the differences of advanced aqueous batteries in each step of the recycling process and discuss the improvements needed from a recycling perspective before commercialization, to further enhance their environmental friendliness. Before batteries enter the recycling process, their collection, transportation, storage, and the screening and regrouping are essential steps. The collection of spent batteries is often influenced by market and policy factors. For spent batteries with higher economic value, owing to the competitive nature of the recycling market, completely collection of spent batteries might not be feasible; however, the situation could be quite the opposite for advanced aqueous batteries. Given that most advanced aqueous batteries have lower economic benefits from recycling, lacking market incentives, well-crafted policies can facilitate their easier collection from users. Following collection, the transportation of spent batteries to processing centers is important. Traditional batteries require strict protective measures during transportation owing to safety concerns, including fire-resistant and shock-proof insulation packaging, and typically, specialized transportation companies manage the delivery. However, advanced aqueous batteries have comparatively lower safety requirements, with reduced risks such as fire hazards, thus allowing simplification in the transportation process requirements and restrictions. Similarly, storage safety standards for spent advanced aqueous batteries can also be less strict. Screening and regrouping are other key steps to assess whether spent batteries are suitable for echelon utilization. The capacity and consistency of the batteries are key factors in determining their suitability for such applications. Nevertheless, screening and regrouping remain challenging for all types of spent batteries, despite the variability of this process across different battery categories being potentially insignificant. The key processes in battery recycling are primarily divided into the pulverization and disassembling methods, both of which involve the pre-treatment of spent batteries followed by further separation (Fig. 1b). As an initial step in the battery recycling, discharging operations are generally necessary. Whether advanced aqueous batteries require discharging is unknown. Non-aqueous batteries should be discharged before recycling because the anodes of charged batteries are highly reactive, and they contain a large amount of flammable liquid internally. If a charged battery is disassembled or pulverized, exposure to air greatly increases the risk of ignition or explosion. In comparison, the anode materials of aqueous batteries demonstrate higher stability in the air or water, not reacting violently when exposed to these environments. Even in the event of a short circuit, they do not produce uncontrollable flames. However, it is noteworthy that despite their higher energy density, advanced aqueous batteries could potentially cause thermal runaway during the crushing process. The amount of heat needs to be determined based on the actual circumstances. Most of the advanced aqueous battery materials reported to date (such as Zn/MnO2) are in a fully charged state at the time of battery production and exhibit extremely high stability. Crushing them in the air or water, even in this charged state, does not pose a safety risk. One significant advantage of aqueous batteries is that crushing them does not require extreme safety precautions or a special electrolyte recovery system. Unlike most non-aqueous batteries, water does not evaporate easily, is flame-retardant, abundant, and does not contaminate the work environment during battery crushing. Moreover, the solutes can be recovered through extensive water washing, further minimizing environmental risks. Although spent advanced aqueous batteries may accumulate tiny amounts of flammable or toxic gases, these can be easily mitigated through a standard factory exhaust system or in a well-ventilated operation environment. There is significant uncertainty in the process of the battery powder separation. It is worth emphasizing that the separation techniques for metal components in the battery, such as current collectors, shells, and metal anodes, are relatively mature. The primary aim in the separation process post-crushing is the effective separation of cathode and anode materials. This task becomes more challenging when the electrode material types are similar. For instance, separating materials becomes significantly difficult for aqueous batteries containing alkali metals if the similar types of metal oxides are used for both cathode and anode materials; once mixed, they are difficult to differentiate with simple flotation methods. In contrast, for aqueous batteries containing multivalent metal ions, if the anode material is the corresponding metal, separation through screening and density differences is more easily achieved. If organic electrode materials are used in advanced aqueous batteries, separation of the cathode and anode materials might be accomplished through a simple dissolution process. A significant advantage of advanced aqueous batteries in the disassembling recycling lies in the characteristics of their water-based electrolytes. The disassembly process can be safely carried out in the air without concern for safety risks, especially when compared to the feasibility of recycling non-aqueous batteries. Furthermore, establishing a production line for disassembling batteries is relatively easy, eliminating the need for specialized systems for collecting flammable or volatile liquids. Once the battery is disassembled, its individual components can be independently immersed in aqueous solutions, which allows for the collection of the electrolyte while preserving other parts. The main issue in electrode material regeneration is removing the binder from the current collector, a challenge that has been extensively researched in the field of LIB recycling and presents comparable difficulties for advanced aqueous batteries. The difficulty in repairing cathode and anode materials for advanced aqueous batteries varies depending on the type of material. Roughly categorizing, the materials containing complex metal oxides, Prussian blue analogs, and polyanionic materials present a higher level of difficulty in regeneration. Those with single metal oxides are relatively simpler to regenerate as they lack additional elemental replenishment unlike the LiCoO2 cathode in LIBs. Metal anodes, on the other hand, can be relatively easily reused through remanufacturing processes. However, the regeneration of organic electrode materials shows great uncertainty owing to the diversity of such materials, complex failure mechanisms, and unknown processes of chemical structure repair. However, if the chemical structure of the materials remains intact, the possibility of their reuse is relatively high. Additionally, the regeneration of cathode and anode materials requires attention to the removal of interfacial impurities and the repair of material structure, particularly because the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) formed on the materials’ surface by aqueous electrolytes tends to be inorganic and insoluble in water. For industrialized methods of element extraction like hydro-metallurgical (Hydro) and pyro-metallurgical (Pyro) processes, there are many references available, but the difficulty also varies with the different materials involved [29,30]. Complex metal oxides, Prussian blue analogs, and polyanionic materials pose greater challenges in dissolution and element separation, and innovative strategies may be anticipated. By contrast, the dissolution processes for single metal oxides, such as manganese oxide or vanadium oxide, have mature technologies for reference. The recovery process for metal anodes, even when opting for element recovery methods, is relatively simple in terms of dissolution. Pyro recovery methods have limited selectivity and may only be suitable for the reduction of metal oxides, with poor applicability for polyanionic materials and Prussian blue analogs. Therefore, selecting the appropriate recovery methodology is crucial to enable effective material recycling and maximize resource utilization. In the recycling process of advanced aqueous batteries, the recovery of the electrolyte should be considered. The concentration of the electrolytes in these batteries is commonly above 1 mol/L and is relatively stable, even in water and air. Although a small portion of the electrolyte may decompose or degrade during battery usage, the majority still has the potential for reuse. Other components of the battery, such as separators and current collectors, are processed in ways very similar to spent LIBs. The ideal strategy would involve re-engineering separators into engineering plastics or reusing them in the production of new separators, while the current collectors can generally be smelted again and used in manufacturing new ones. In summary, in terms of the recycling process, advanced aqueous batteries present less safety and environmental requirements. The potentially complex procedure is the separation of cathode and anode materials. From the perspective of recycling efficiency, in advanced aqueous batteries, the binder and conductive additives are the most likely parts to be released from the electrode materials through thermal decomposition. These typically constitute about 3%–4% of the battery. The remaining materials are relatively easy to recover. Thus, we can ensure that during the recycling process of advanced aqueous batteries, the batteries themselves do not release excessive materials into the environment. In other words, even if we assume that the energy consumption of recycling advanced aqueous batteries is similar to that of current spent LIBs, the environmental impact of advanced aqueous batteries is far superior to the latter. 4 Environmental and economic analysis of aqueous batteries recycling The recycling processes mentioned above have combined into the three primary battery recycling methods: Pyrometallurgy (Pyro), hydrometallurgy (Hydro), and direct regeneration. Taking the Na2MnFe(CN)6/Zn battery as an example, we compared three different processing methods using Tour’s evaluation method (Table 2 and Fig. 2 a–c) [31]. The current collector and shell of this battery are mainly made of iron materials, with carbon-based materials used as conductive agents in the cathode electrodes, PVDF as a binder, a modified polypropylene as the separator, and a 1 M ZnSO4 solution as the electrolyte. Among these battery materials, the only combustible materials are the binder and conductive agent, which together amount to approximately 2.6% of the overall composition; the rest are inorganic metals or compounds. Pyrometallurgy usually takes place after direct crushing and separation of the electrolyte, followed by a calcination process and concluding with leaching as the final step (Fig. 2a). Hydrometallurgy, after crushing and separating the electrolyte, involves further separation of different metals and cathode materials, and ultimately leaches the cathode material (Fig. 2b). As for direct regeneration, it directly regenerates the recovered cathode materials obtained from a similar material separation process (Fig. 2c). Owing to the unique material system of the Na2MnFe(CN)6/Zn battery, all three methodologies theoretically yield similar material recovery rates for the battery materials, with the conductive additives and binder being lost (Fig. 3 a). This indicates that aqueous batteries have high recycling rates and, consequently, relatively low greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions associated with their disposal (Fig. 3b). Compared to this, the differences in GHG emissions caused by different recycling processes are mainly attributed by chemical and energy consumption, where Pyro and Hydro have significant environmental impacts that should be carefully considered when choosing battery recycling processes, in terms of environmental costs. Assessing the cost and revenue of the battery recycling process is a crucial factor in ensuring its commercial viability. After estimating energy consumption, chemical use, labor costs, and fixed overheads for the facility, the processing costs for Pyro, Hydro, and direct regeneration methods are respective $1.4, $1.6, and $1.1 kg−1 of battery [32,33]. However, the theoretical maximum revenue is only $1.00 kg−1 of battery, with the primary value from the recovery of zinc (Table 2 and Fig. 3c). However, if cathode regeneration is conducted, the theoretical maximum revenue can significantly increase to $5.19 kg−1 of battery. This indicates that the effective regeneration of cathode materials not only helps to enhance the value of recovered materials but is also a key factor in realizing the economic feasibility of battery recycling. Advanced aqueous battery recycling is less favorable compared to lead-acid but similar to alkaline and zinc–carbon batteries, unless it involves direct regeneration of cathode materials or design optimized for recyclability. Lead-acid recycling is superior in efficiency, emissions, and profitability. Advanced aqueous batteries potentially achieve a recycling rate of 87.7%, slightly higher than their alkaline and zinc–carbon counterparts, yet with lesser value. Economic viability could weaken with reduced zinc in commercial advanced aqueous batteries. Given current recycling processes and material usage, Na2MnFe(CN)6/Zn battery recovery is less profitable, whereas the higher material content in alkaline and zinc–carbon batteries could mean greater returns. Lead-acid battery recycling’s environmental impact depends on energy consumption during lead recovery, whereas advanced aqueous and alkaline and zinc–carbon battery recycling is nearly identical. In summary, advanced aqueous battery recycling represents a hybrid approach, combining aspects of alkaline and zinc–carbon battery recycling and LIB recycling. The former provides guidance on partial material treatment, while the latter contributes insights into material separation. Future recycling feasibility for advanced aqueous batteries is closely related to the choice of battery materials. 5 Perspective Building on the research using Hydro analysis on Na2MnFe(CN)6/Zn batteries, we comparatively analyze advanced aqueous batteries in terms of the complexity, economic viability, and environmental impact of their recycling processes. By examining the material composition of various types of advanced aqueous batteries, it is shown that the difficulty in recycling batteries generally ranks with this order: Alkali metal batteries are the most complex, while non-metal ion batteries and high-valency metal ion batteries are comparatively simpler to process (Fig. 3d). Among the several factors affecting recycling complexity, not only do the cathode and anode materials play a critical role, but the concentration, viscosity, and stability of the electrolytes, as well as the type and material system of the current collectors, also exhibit considerable influence. For example, a high concentration electrolyte paired with two different types of current collectors significantly increases the difficulty of battery crushing and material separation, whereas a lower concentration electrolyte eases these challenges when paired with two types of collectors. A single type of current collector combined with a low concentration electrolyte would present the least difficulty in the recycling process, especially when the collector is made of a single carbon material. In the future, as battery technologies develop, particularly with the increased use of organic materials in the cathodes or anodes of advanced aqueous batteries, the recycling of these batteries will be greatly simplified. This not only contributes to improving overall recycling efficiency but also suggests that advanced aqueous batteries may become a more sustainable energy storage solution. The economic benefits of recycling advanced aqueous batteries depend on the recoverable value of the active ions and their materials. Currently, the cathode and anode materials used in these batteries are trending toward simplification and cost reduction. Aside from high-value aqueous LIBs and chlorine-ion batteries that use expensive cathode materials like silver, the value of active ions, anode metals, and other electrode materials in other batteries is relatively low, usually not exceeding $7 kg−1 (Fig. 3e). Given their low economic value, aqueous batteries that are eco-friendly and are not considered as hazardous waste are likely to be relegated to landfill disposal by most recycling policies; this approach, however, results in a considerable resource waste [34]. To make recycling economically viable, strategies for advanced aqueous batteries need to focus on the upcycling of materials or their regeneration. From an environmental impact point, the external emissions produced during the recycling process of all advanced aqueous batteries are negligible. This is thanks to the materials system design of these batteries. They typically contain binder and conductive agents as potential sources of external emissions. Although the organic electrode materials that may be used in the future can theoretically be easily separated by solvent extraction, avoiding the need for direct pyrolysis, this reduces environmental risk. Hence, the environmental concerns associated with the recycling of advanced aqueous batteries do not come from the batteries themselves but rather from the different recycling methods employed. From the above analysis, it is evident that the challenges faced by advanced aqueous batteries in recycling include both the enhancement of economic revenues and the minimization of environmental impacts caused by recycling process (Fig. 3f). Developing and optimizing recycling technologies will become key to driving sustainable development in this field. Therefore, when considering the recycling of advanced aqueous batteries, attention should not only be given to battery design but also to innovative recycling processes. These innovations should aim to ensure that the recycling process is energy-efficient, low in emissions, and high in productivity, ultimately achieving economic feasibility for advanced aqueous batteries in practical applications. A critical aspect of the entire recycling process is the electrode material regeneration, where not only the removal of impurities from the material surface and structural repair should be addressed but also suitable material regeneration strategies should be explored to achieve optimal performance recovery. Moreover, throughout all recycling processes, we need to assess the times a material can be regenerated. Considering that materials may become difficult to restore effectively after multiple regenerations, the question arises whether it should proceed directly to the element extraction. In the reality of continuously advancing battery technology, exploring how to integrate materials from current stage into the next generation through regeneration or upcycling is also an issue that requires consideration. Given the low value of the material system of advanced aqueous batteries, it is particularly important to explore the potential for these materials in high-value applications. We need to emphasize that the development of processes for the harmless disposal of advanced aqueous batteries’ materials and the extraction of elements is necessary. The applications of these materials extend well beyond advanced aqueous batteries; they have potential prospects in various fields such as catalysis, gas storage, and fuel cells. For the optimization element extraction techniques, a comprehensive consideration of the closed-loop nature of material recycling should be made, including the reuse of extraction solvents and reducing the excessive use of chemical agents such as reductants or precipitating agents, to achieve an environmentally friendly and economically efficient recycling process. 6 Representative examples for aqueous battery recycling Efforts are now underway to consider the recycling of advanced aqueous batteries, where most research is directed toward exploring the recyclability of aqueous related batteries. Before 2022, research was focused on degradable aqueous batteries, primarily including various biomaterials and synthesized organics [35]. Hu et al., for instance, developed a poly(benzoquinonyl sulfide)/Zn-coordinated chitosan/Zn battery with chitosan electrolytes extracted from crustacean shells, achieving complete degradation in soil within five months (Fig. 4 a) [35]. Given the battery’s eco-friendly aqueous solution and recyclable metals, only conductive additives and binders need to be recycled, constituting only 2%–4% of the battery’s weight. If most combustible parts are biodegradable or eco-friendly, spent batteries could serve as biofuel alternatives. This contrasts with traditional LIBs, which necessitate addressing fluoride emission during combustion. Yang et al. designed an all-organic aqueous zinc-ion battery with electrodes and binders composed of C, H, O, and N elements [36], similar to an all-biomass battery that originates from nature and returns to it after use (Fig. 4b). Metals from the current collectors and key battery elements are recyclable directly from the combustion ash. In 2022, Wang et al. led the advancement of advanced aqueous battery recycling by proving the reusability of nanocellulose fiber in batteries [37]. From 2023 onward, extensive work began addressing advanced aqueous battery recycling. The reported works include batteries designed for easy recycling and recyclable electrolytes [38–40]. Here, we present three examples. Firstly, the organic/Zn battery as reported by Wang et al., showed an azobenzene/Zn battery that can be recycled in any state of charge (Fig. 4c) [38]. The recycling of azobenzene is achieved via extraction with commercial solvents of low boiling points, where extraction efficiency can reach up to 96% (Fig. 4d). The extracted material can then obtain azobenzene through low-temperature solvent evaporation. This recycled azobenzene maintains a structure identical to the fresh material and exhibits excellent electrochemical performances. The second example is Zn/iodine batteries, in which the cycled electrolyte membrane can simply be cut into pieces, washed, and directly reprocessed into new electrolyte membranes (Fig. 4e) [39]. The recycled membranes showed identical electrochemical characteristics compared to new ones. The third example is the recovery of the cathode in Zn-air batteries which use a magnetic binder. The cathode materials can be dispersed in a solution with ultrasonication and then separated by magnetic method, allowing for regeneration or reuse (Fig. 4f) [40]. These examples demonstrate that with a strategic choice of battery materials, advanced aqueous batteries can be simplified for recycling, with most materials potentially recycled and reused, thus promoting the sustainable closed-loop lifecycle of advanced aqueous batteries. 7 Conclusions In this perspective, we discussed the potential advantages and disadvantages of recycling advanced aqueous batteries. Owing to their use of nontoxic and nonvolatile green electrolytes, advanced aqueous batteries allow for reduced safety requirements in the recycling process, simplify operational procedures, and facilitate the efficient recovery and reuse of the electrolyte. Additionally, advanced aqueous batteries seldom employ carbon-containing electrode materials, which typically results in lower carbon emissions in various recycling methods. However, the most significant obstacle for recycling advanced aqueous batteries remains the lack of potential economic benefits, mainly owing to the relatively low value of the raw materials used in their manufacture. For the recycling of advanced aqueous batteries to be economically feasible in the future, commercially batteries should be designed to be easily recyclable. Moreover, specific recycling processes should be developed to maximize the value derived from spent advanced aqueous batteries. Only through innovation and optimization in battery design and recycling processes can a balance between environmental sustainability and economic viability be achieved, assisting the practicality of widespread adoption and application of advanced aqueous batteries.
