The catalytic performance test, combined with other complementary characterization techniques, provides the information for fundamental understanding of the relationship between catalyst preparation and performance. Experimental results indicate that the catalyst with an eggshell palladium profile has a higher partial hydrogenation selectivity and less coke formation. The results also indicate that the better activity maintenance for the eggshell catalyst is due to the lower tendency for coke formation from conjugated dienes polymerization. As a result, the eggshell catalyst is much more active, selective and stable than the uniform profile catalyst. In this study, the catalytic reactions were carried out at reaction conditions similar to those of a commercial run: 44 and 30 atm. The palladium concentration profiles and. particle sizes were determined by EPMA (electron probe microanalysis) and TEM (transmission electron microscopy) respectively. The coke deposited on the catalysts was characterized by DSC (differential scanning calorimetry) and the likely coke precursors were identified by GC/MS (gas chromatography /mass spectrometer) spectroscopy.

Introduction Pyrolysis gasoline, a naphtha cracking by-product with a boiling point range from 36 to about 204, is unstable because it contains highly reactive species, such as conjugated dialkenes, styrene and indene. This liquid has to be stabilized by hydrogenation processes *Corresponding author. 0926-860X/94/$07.00 1994 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved SSDI0926-860X(93)E0202-N 8 TB. Gin, T-C. Chou lApied Cata(rsis A: General !08 (1994) 7-19 to yield high-octane number gasoline blending components [ 1,2] . To stabilize the gasoline with minimum lose, in octane number, the catalysts used for this hydrogenation process must be selective for producing alkenes from conjugated dienes. Along with this selective hydrogenation, it is also desirable to isomerize a-alkenes to internal alkenes, whose octane numbers are relatively high [3]. Supported palladium catalysts, which have been proved to be active and selective for the hydrogenation of alkadienes and alkynes [ 3-6 J , are widely used in partial hydrogenation of pyrolysis gasoline from naphtha cracking. The three most important aspects of the practical use of a heterogeneous catalyst are its activity, selectivity and lifetime. It has been reported [7-161 that the metal concentration profile of supported metal catalysts significantly affects the performance in selective hydrogenation. A recent paper [ 13 ] has shown that supported palladium catalysts with an eggshell metal distribution exhibit superior activity and selectivity for the hydrogenation of diene in comparison with uniformly distributed palladium catalysts. Although the lifetime is the aspect that often defines the viability of a process, the effect of the palladium concentration profile on catalyst deactivation for the selective hydrogenation of isoprene has not been reported. Theoretical studies on the distribution of the active component in support materials have been reported to affect the catalyst lifetime for consecutive reactions [ 10,1 11 . However, those studies did not specify the reaction system. Thus their results may not be applicable to the hydrogenation of isoprene. To study the effect of the metal profile on the deactivation of isoprene hydrogenation catalysts, two types of catalyst are proposed, i.e. uniform and eggshell catalysts. The procedure for the preparation of uniformly distributed palladium catalysts is well known. However, because of the difficulty in controlling the metal loading of eggshell catalysts by conventional impregnation techniques, the catalysts so prepared were not always of the same metal loading [ 17 ] . Since the nature of the active sites of supported metal catalysts is a function of the metal loading, the conclusions derived from the comparisons of metal profile catalysts with different metal loadings may be unreliable. The objectives of this study are to compare activity and selectivity of these catalysts investigated previously by Berenblyum et al. [ 13] and to determine the effect of metal profile on the catalyst lifetime. 2. Experimental To demonstrate the effects of metal concentration profile on the catalytic performance, two catalyst samples with the same metal loading, within 2% deviation, but different distributions were prepared. One was uniform, and the other eggshell. Isoprene partial hydrogenation reaction was chosen as the model reaction because (1) isoprene was a coke precursor of pyrolysis gasoline hydrogenation process; (2) isoamylene, a main reaction product of isoprene, was the feedstock for the TAME (tertiary amyl methyl ether) process. The coke deposited on the used catalysts was characterized by temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). The coke precursors were identified by gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). With these complementary techniques, a possible mechanism was proposed to explain the difference in catalyst deactivation of these two types of catalysts. T .B. Lire, T-C. Choir /Applied Catalysis A: General 108 (1994) 7-79 9 2.1. Material and catalyst preparation The 8-AI20, support was prepared by calcining y-Al.03 (A2U, Osaka Yogyo) at 1000 for 6 h. The resulting material had a bulk density of 0.68 g/cm3. The BET surface area and pore volume measured with an Omnisorp 360 analyzer were 82.4 m2 /g and 0.570 cmj/g, respectively. The uniform catalyst was prepared by a wet impregnation techynique: the 8A1203 was mixed with a solution of 0.1523 g Pd(NH3)4(NO3)Z in 50 ml deionized water for 3 h, followed by drying at 100 for 1 h and then calcining at 350 for 6 h. The eggshell catalyst was prepared by the similar procedure but with a solution of 0.1068 g Pd(CH3COO)2 in 150 ml toluene. Both catalysts contained 0.2 wt.-% Pd, measured by inductively plasma optical emission spectroscopy using a Jarnell-Ash 1100 instrument. 2.2. Electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) The palladium concentration profiles of the catalysts were measured by EPMA (Jeol 840A link AN 10). The catalyst was imbedded in a thermoplastic resin. After solidification, No. 1500 sand paper was used to grind off the catalyst particles so as to expose the cross section. For fine polishing, No. 3000 sand paper was used. The sample was coated with a layer of carbon by vacuum deposition. The acceleration voltage of the electron beam was 20 kV and the sample current was 0.05 1.ss,A. The scanning speed was 0.02 mm/min. 2.3. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) The catalysts were examined using a Jeol 200 CS electron microscope. Samples were ultrasonically dispersed in absolute ethanol, and the suspension was collected on copper grids. The particle size was determined at 200 kV and 730 000 magnification. Patterns were observed on a fluorescent screen, and recorded photographically using 800 ISO film and a 15 s exposure time. For both samples, the specimen exhibited great stability under the beam. 2.4. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) The apparatus used for the TPR experiments was described by Bhatia et al. [ 18 ] . Catalyst samples of 0.4 g were predried in flowing argon at 1.8 1/h and 350 for 1 h [ 19]. After the samples were cooled down to room temperature, the TPR experiments were performed with a Hz : Ar mixture (10:90 molar ratio) stream flowing at about 1.81(NTP) /h at 1 atm with a maximum temperature of 500 and a heating rate of 10/min. The water produced in the reduction was adsorbed in a silica gel column. Hydrogen consumed during the reduction was monitored with a TCD detector and the temperature was detected by a K type thermocouple. 2.5. Isoprene hydrogenation reaction The catalytic activity for the selective hydrogenation of 10 wt.-% isoprene (Merck) in n-heptane (Merck) was determined by a downflow continuous fixed-bed reactor. The reactor is a vertical stainless steel tube with an inside diameter of 2.2 cm and an inside 10 TB. Gin, T.-C. Chou /Applied Catalysis A: General 108 (1994) 7-19 volume of 94.0 ml. It was heated by an electrical heater and the temperature was controlled by a PID temperature controller with a sensor in the center of the catalyst bed. The reactants were preheated before entering the catalyst bed. The product was trapped by a condenser at - 30. The reaction system was pressurized with nitrogen at 32 atm for leak test. After that, a blank test with packed glass beads was performed. No reaction products were detected at 45 and 30 atm. The catalyst samples were installed and reduced in-situ with a 121(NTP) / h hydrogen at 100 and 30 atm for 10 h [ 20] . The hydrogenation reaction was then carried out with a weight hourly space velocity of 18 h-' (g of feed/h g of catalyst), at 44, 30 atm and a Hz/isoprene molar ratio =2.262. Since the selective hydrogenation of 10 wt.-% isoprene in n-heptane is an exothermic reaction, the catalyst bed was diluted with inert glass beads (2.5 ml of 2 mm diameter catalysts mixed with 25 ml 0.4-0.6 mm diameter glass bead). The top and the bottom part of the reactor were filled with glass beads. A gradient packing method (the catalyst-to-diluent ratio increased from 0 at inlet to 0.2 at outlet of the reactor) was used for catalyst packing to maintain an isothermal profile and eliminate unwanted wall and bypassing effects [20,21 ] . Up to 97% feed was recovered as reaction products in the material balance test, indicating the reaction system was adequate for the performance test. Liquid products were collected periodically and analyzed by gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-8A, FIE) model) coupled with a data processor (SP4270). A packed column (23% SP-1700 on '.80/ 100 ehromosorb PAW, 9.15 m X 0.32 cm OD) was used at 55 with N, carrier gas at 1.21(NTP) /h flow-rate. The gas product was analyzed with a PONA analyzer for material balance as shown in Table 1. 2.6. Characterization of precursor coke and used catalyst The coke precursors were extracted from the used catalysts with toluene at 151 for 24 h using a Soxhlet apparatus and then analyzed on a GC/MS. The GC/MS system was a Hewlett Packard model 5890A gas chromatograph (equipped with a 5% phenylmethyl siloxane capillary column, HP Ultra 2 column, 50 m long) and a Hewlett Packard 5970 series Mass Selective Detector with a HP 300 data station. The analysis conditions were as follows: The temperature of the GC oven started at 50 for 1 min and then increased at 5/min temperature programming rate until it reached 300 for 0.5 h. The injection and detector temperature were 250 and 280, respectively. The carrier gas was He at 31(NTP) / h. Sample was injected with 1.0 ,eel splitless injection. Mass spectrometer was operated at 33-220 mle and 70 eV ionization voltage. Table I Composition of flue gas Gas components Mot-9o of product H, 99.937 C',. 0.051 Isopentane 0.011 Methane 0.001 TB. Lin, T -C. Chou /Applied Catalvsis A: General 108 (1994) 7-19 I I The coke properties were characterized by the TPO experiments (Setaram, TG/DTA92/ DSC 121) which were performed with an air stream flowing at about 1.8 1(NTP) /h at 1 atm with a maximum temperature of 800 and a heating rate of 10/min. 3. Results 3. I. Palladium concentration profiles The palladium concentration profiles obtained using EPMA are shown in Fig. 1. The sample prepared from :Pd(NH3) 4(NO3) 2 gave a macroscopic uniform concentration profile, while a symmetrical eggshell palladium concentration profile was observed for the sample prepared from Pd (CH,COO)Z. From EPMA results, both catalyst samples contained about 0.2 wt.-% Pd, which was consistent with the results measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy. The palladium concentration as well as the metal loading could be well controlled for both eggshell and uniform type catalysts. 3.2. Temperature programmed reduction The TPR spectra from room temperature to 500 showed only one reduction peak for both catalysts. However, depending on the catalyst precursor, the peaks characterizing the reduction of two samples are slightly different; a peak at 59 for the sample prepared from Pd(CH3COO)= and 63 for Pd (NH3)4(NO;)=. Since no other peaks were observed under Pd, wt% 3.2 0.8 2.4 0.6 (a) 1.6 0.4 lmm 0.8 0.2 1_~ I ~ _Y 0 0 w I I I I I I R 0 R R 0 R Fig. I. EPMA response profiles (a) eggshell, (b) uniform. 12 TB. Lin, T.-C. Chou /Applied Catalysis A: General 108 (1994) 7-19 the experimental conditions of the TPR measurement, the results indicated that both samples could be reduced below 100. Therefore, the PdO reduction temperature was set at I 00 before the catalytic; performance test. These observations agree with those obtained by Cheng et al. [ 20 ] . 3.3. Isoprene hydrogenation The main products of isoprene hydrogenation are 2-methyl- 1-butene (2M 1 B), 3-methyl1-butene (3MIB), 2-methyl-2-butene (2M2B) and 2-methyl-butane (IC5). As shown in Fig. 2, the product compositions using eggshell and uniform type of catalysts were significantly different. The concentration of isoprene against time-on-stream for both catalysts is shown in Fig. 3. The initial activity of the eggshell catalyst was higher than that of the uniform catalyst. In addition, the eggshell catalyst underwent deactivation more slowly than the other. The concentrations or yields of partial hydrogenation product, isopentenes (hereafter referred as MB) and total hydrogenation product, IC5, are shown in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively. At 150 h timie-on-stream, the concentration of MB was 2.3 and 0.5 mol/I by using eggshell and uniform catalysts, respectively. This is shown in Fig. 4. The MB product yields are much higher with the eggshell catalyst than the uniform catalyst. Furthermore, the unwanted IC5 was generated in smaller amounts with the eggshell catalyst than the uniform catalyst as shown in Fig. 5. The partial hydrogenation selectivity is defined as the ratio of total moles of 2M 113, 3M 1 B and 2M2B produced to the moles of IP converted. As shown in Fig. 6, the selectivity of MB increases with time-on-stream for both eggshell and uniform catalysts and the use of eggshell catalyst shows a much higher selectivity. Again, the eggshell catalyst produces more 2M2B and 2M 1 B than the uniform catalyst (Fig. 7) . The 2M213 and 2M I B are valuable products for the feed to the TAME process. to (a) to (b) 8 BB v s 8 p\" 0 -E 6 6 O C w C 4 ib. 4 C C u u 2 p 2 0~ U 0 0 50 100 150 200 250 0 50 100 150 200 250 Time on stream, h Time on stream, h Fig. 2.

Characterisation of coke Fig. 9a shows the coke precursors identified by DSC for the used catalysts after 240 h of operation. The results show that the eggshell catalyst has less coke formation than has the uniform catalyst. The main peak characterizing the oxidation of coke was almost at the same temperature, 308, for both catalyst samples. An additional small peak was observed at 455 for the uniform catalyst and 408 for the eggshell catalyst. After 24 h Soxhlet extraction of the used catalysts, the DSC spectra are significantly changed as shown in Fig. 9b. The intensity of the main peak at 308 for both catalyst samples was reduced. The peak at 408 for the eggshell catalyst disappeared; on the other hand, it seemed that the peak at 455 for the uniform catalyst shifted to 370. These data provide an indication of the amount and properties of carbonaceous deposits or coke formation. This information can be used to explain catalyst deactivation. T B. Lin. T-C.

Selectivity and activity for both types of~catalvsts By comparing the catalytic performance of the two types of catalysts, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4, the catalyst of eggshell metal profile presents higher isoprene conversion, MB selectivity and stability. The observed higher MB selectivity and isoprene conversion for using the eggshell type catalyst are consistent with the results reported by Corbett et al. [ 1 1 ] and Berenblym et al. [ 13] and can be explained by the following simplified reaction scheme [ 22 ] 3 IB Ip- 2M211 -- IC5 2 1B - The partial hydrogenation products, 2M 1 B and 3M 1 B, were produced by 1-2 addition of hydrogen to the isoprene, whereas 2M2B was formed by 1-4 addition and the isomerization of 2MIB and 3MIB (double bond migration reaction). The unwanted product, isopentane, was formed by the further hydrogenation of isopentenes (hereafter defined as the sum of 3M 1 B, 2M 1B and 2M2B). For the eggshell catalyst, the diffusion distance from the pore mouth to the active sites is relatively short. There are no active sites within the catalyst particle except near the external surface of the eggshell catalyst. Once isopentenes are formed, the opportunity for further hydrogenation of the isopentenes to form isopentane is relatively low by using an eggshell catalyst in comparison with a uniform catalyst. The same reaction mechanism may also be used to explain the results of isoprene conversion. Since the metal loading of two catalysts is similar, it may be assumed that the number of active sites for both types of catalysts is similar. However, for the uniform catalyst, more internal active sites were used for converting isopentenes to isopentane; therefore, less active sites were available for isoprene partial hydrogenation resulting in lower selectivity for isopentenes. The lower conversion of isoprene when using the uniform catalyst may also be explained by the incomplete utilization of active sites near the center of the catalyst particle resulting from diffusional hindrance as suggested by Berenblyum et al. [ 13 ] . 4.2. Catalyst deactivation Catalyst deactivation may be due to coking, fouling, sintering or mechanical breakdown. For making motor-gasoline from pyrolysis gasoline, it is desirable to convert dialkenes to alkenes with minimum hydrogenation of the latter to saturates [ 3,23 ] . Coke buildup from the polymerization of dialkenes is the main reason of catalyst deactivation as suggested by Griffiths et al. [ 23], Sze and Bauer [241 and Trimm [25]. Other impurities such as sulfur, nitrogen, organometalliccompounds can also poison the catalyst temporarily or permanently [26]. To investigate the effects of metal concentration profile on the catalyst deactivation TB. Gin, T-C. Chou /Applied Catalysis A: General 108 (1994) 7-19 17 for pyrolysis gasoline hydrogenation, pure isoprene was used as a model compound because: ( I ) C5 content of raw pyrolysis gasoline is commonly between 10 and 20%; (2) isoprene is a potential coke precursor; (3) the main products, 2M 1 B and 2M2B, are a feedstock for the TAME process. As shown in Fig. 3, the deactivation rate for the uniform catalyst is much higher than that for the eggshell catalyst after an induction period of about 25 h. In addition, DSC spectra, which characterize coke deposition, show a main peak at 308 for both catalysts. However, a higher intensity of the main peak was found for the uniform catalyst catalyst. Another peak as shown in Fig. 9a, indicating that more coke was deposited on this DSC peak, was found at 408 for the eggshell catalyst and 455 for the uniform catalyst. Since the higher DSC temperature indicates the formation of harder coke, these results suggest that a higher molecular weight coke was formed on the uniform catalyst. On the basis of DSC data shown in Fig. 9b, about 56.9 and 68.6 wt.-% of the deposited coke were removed by the extraction of the eggshell and uniform spent catalyst, respectively. These results indicated that coke was removed by toluene more easily from the eggshell than the uniform spent catalyst. The DSC result of Figs. 9a and 9b are consistent with the results of GC/MS spectra. The fact that coke formation rate for the eggshell catalyst is lower than the uniform catalyst may be attributable to the lower active sites poisoning rate. The better stability for the eggshell catalyst is due to the higher hydrogen partial pressure at the shell of the catalyst inhibiting the coke build-up and further polymerization. The GC/MS spectroscopy characterization indicated that the coke precursors with molecular weights less than 136 g/cool (compounds I to 9 and 12, Table 2) are mainly aromatic compounds and those of more than 136 g/ mol are the polymerization products of isoprene. The detailed mechanism of the aromatic coke precursor formation is still unclear. However, GC and GC/MS spectroscopy results (Tables 1 and 2) suggest that aromatic compounds were formed possibly by a number of reaction steps involving dimerization, isomerization, dehydrogenation and h;ydrogenolysis. It is worthy to notice that hydrocarbons with molecular weights higher than about 136 g/ mole could only be observed for the uniform catalyst sample as shown in Table 2. These results are consistent with the DSC data that harder (higher molecular weight) coke tends to form more readily on the uniform catalyst. Coke properties related to the type of catalyst may again be explained by considering the diffusion distance from the pore mouth of the catalyst to active sites. The distance for the eggshell catalyst is shorter than that for the uniform catalyst. Consequently, a less reactive coke precursor can easily diffuse out from the catalyst pore mouth and thus high molecular weight coke is more difficult to form. The quick catalyst deactivation of the uniform catalyst may be due to the decrease of active sites, diffusion hindrance and/or pore plugging by the hard coke deposition. Our experimental results indicate that the eggshell catalyst has a higher lifetime for a consecutive reaction (.A ---> B - C), which is contrary to the theoretical calculations by Corbett et al. [ I 11 . This contradiction may be explained by different coke formation mechanisms. In the study by Corbett et al. the deactivation was assumed to be caused by the deposition of self-fouling product C on active sites. The eggshell catalyst has a higher self-fouling selectivity and thus the deactivation rate is higher. In this study, the catalyst deactivation is mainly caused by the side reaction of isoprene hydrogenation, isoprene polymerization not by the self-fouling products. The more coke deposition on uniform 18 T .B. Lin, T -C. Chou l Applied Catah si.s A: General 108 (1994) 7-19 catalyst indicates that this catalyst gives higher isoprene polymerization rate resulting in higher deactivation rate. The ensemble size of Pd may also affect the coke formation. The TEM characterization of Pd particle on both types of catalyst shows no obvious differences in particle size: about 8 A. These results are consistent with those reported in the literature [6,26,27] ; no significant palladium particle size differences were observed for supported palladium catalysts prepared from different precursors, Pd(CH3COO), and Pd(NH,)a(NO,)=. These results suggest that ensemble effects on the deactivation are not very important. However, it may not be possible to completely rule out this mechanism because the particle size of palladium of these two samples is inherently nonuniform. 5. Conclusion Well-controlled metal loadings of uniform and eggshell palladium profile catalysts were successfully prepared by salt and organometallic precursor, respectively. These catalysts were used to investigate the effects of metal concentration profiles on partial hydrogenation of conjugated dienes. The catalytic performance tests show that the conversion, isopentenes selectivity and stability for the eggshell catalyst are higher than those for the uniform catalyst. Both DSC characterization of coke deposition and GC/MS spectroscopy characterization of coke precursors indicate that hard coke is more difficult to form on the eggshell catalyst than the uniform catalyst. Based on the results of analysis of used catalyst and catalytic performance test, the lower deactivation rate for the eggshell catalyst may be attributed to both different type and lower rate of coke formation. Tests also showed that coke properties were significantly affected by the metal concentration profiles. As a result, the eggshell catalyst is much more active, selective and stable than uniform profile catalyst. References [ I ] Shell Development Co., Hydrocarbon Proc.. Sept. ( 1982) 126.
