(Received April 9, 1990; accepted July 1, 1990) Abstract Films prepared from THF solutions containing cellulose acetate, [HRh(CO)(PPh3)a] and PPha were tested for catalytic activity in the vapor phase hydroformylation of ethylene and propylene: RCH^Ha+CO+Hg^RCHzCHaCHO. The reaction proceeded smoothly at 800 ton- and 80 C. Turnover rates were about 25 mol propanal per mol Rh per h. No loss of PPhg or Rh from the film was observed even after long periods of reaction. The excess PPhs seemed to stabilize the catalytic activity of the film but concentrations beyond 10 molar produced no further improvement. The turnover rate with the films was equal to or even slightly higher than that obtained under similar conditions using a homogeneous solution of [HRh(CO)PPha] in 2-methymaphthalene solvent. The turnover rate for propylene to C-4 aldehydes was about an order of magnitude smaller than that for ethylene to propanal. Films prepared from poly(phenylsulfone) were also active catalysts. The ratio of n/iso C-4 aldehydes with this support was about 20. In the absence of oxygen the catalyst system retained its activity for more than 13 days but no attempt was made to test for longer lifetimes. The use of polymeric films or membranes as a support for the rhodium catalysis of the hydroformylation reaction thus appears to hold considerable promise. Introduction One of the major advances in catalytic chemistry in the past 25 years has been the development of transition metal catalysts chemically bonded to solid supports [1]. Such supports may be e.g. inorganic oxides such as silica, or organic polymers such as polystyrene. In an example of the former [2], the transition metal is incorporated by reaction of surface SiOH groups with an alkylmetal, e.g.: ^-SiOH ^-SiO <q + Zr(CHzPh)4 - ^ ZrfCHzPhiz+ZCKjPh ^-SiOH ^-SiO'' As examples of the latter [3, 4], the metal is incorporated by reacting a phosphinated polystyrene with Wilkinson's catalyst: PPhg + Rh(PPh3)3CI *- \\t-P(Pn)2 - Rh(PPh2)CI + PPh3 0304-5102/90/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 214 Such supported or anchored catalysts are presumed to combine virtues of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. In attempts to unite the feature of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts in one configuration, supported liquid phase catalysts (SLPC) have been employed [5]. Such catalysts are prepared by dissolving a transition metal complex in a high- boiling solvent and impregnating a porous support material such as alumina or silica with this solution. We have reported previously [6] on the preparation of a cellulose acetate membrane in which was incorporated either a ruthenium or a rhodium complex. The incorporation was achieved by dissolving both the complex and the cellulose acetate in tetrahydrofuran (THF), concentrating the solution to an appropriate viscosity, and then casting a film from the solution. Some of the major advantages of incorporating the metal complex in this fashion are the uniform distribution of metal sites, the high proportion of these metal sites on or near the surface and the ease of diffusion of reactive gases into the membrane pores. We found that in the presence of a stream of carbon monoxide, ruthenium and rhodium salts are readily converted to carbonyl complexes at room temperature. Furthermore, the metal carbonyls formed in situ were shown [6] to exchange CO. We wish to report here that the well-known hydrofonnylation catalyst [HRh(CO)(PPh3)g] when incorporated into cellulose acetate [(or (poly)phenylsulfone)] membranes is a very active catalyst for ethylene and propylene hydrofonnylation at 80 C and atmospheric pressure. Experimental Apparatus A continuous flow catalytic reactor was constructed for our experiments consisting of a glass tube containing the catalyst inside a heated outer supporting glass tube. The outer tube (glass pipe) (9 in long, 2 in i.d.), bearing 2.5 in diameter 0-ring at the flanged top end, was mounted vertically. The bottom end was drawn down to generate a 10 mm tube and onto this tube was ring-sealed a 14/20 female ground glass joint concentric with the outside tube. The female joint supported the catalyst-bearing glass tube which was 8 in long, having an i.d. of 0.8 in, fitted with a 14/20 male joint. This glass tube was open at the top end and near the bottom end, above the ground glass joint, a sintered glass disk was sealed to support the catalyst. Both the inner and outer tubes were wrapped with several layers of aluminum foil. In the annular space around the inner tube was placed an aluminum cylinder 6.5 in long, 1.25 in i.d. and 1.85 in o.d. in order to distribute the heat uniformly. This cylinder was supported by glass beads surrounding the female lower joint, the volume of these beads being adjusted to position the cylinder at the appropriate height. Electrical input to the heating tape wrapped around the outer tube was controlled by a Variac connected to a constant voltage transformer. A thermocouple was placed at the middle of the outer 215 wall of the outside glass tube. Glass fiber insulation surrounded the entire reactor. The exit end of the outside glass tube led to an 8 ml vial capped with a serum stopper used for sampling the product stream. From the sampling tube, the gases passed through a 75 nun (3 in) column of mercury used to maintain pressure on the reactor at 815 torr and thence to a wet test meter. The reactor cap consisted of a flanged glass tube, matching the outside glass tube, which was drawn down to generate a 10 mm glass tube through which the reactants were fed. Closure of the cap to the matching outside reactor tube was made with a spring-loaded clamp on the flange bearing the 0-ring. Reactant gases were fed from commercial cylinders at ambient temperature through two-stage gas regulators (except for the single stage propylene regulator) at exit pressures of 8-10 psi. The gases were conducted through Tygon tubing to individual deoxygenators containing activated Badische catalyst R3-11. From the deoxygenators, the gases were conducted through copper tubing to a three-channel gas proportioner (Cole-Palmer J-3218-54), from which the combined gas stream passed via copper tubing through a 8 ml sampling vial and thence into the tube of the reactor cap. Samples for analysis by GLC were withdrawn by means of a gas syringe. The feed mixtures were analyzed using a 5A molecular sieve column and a thermal conductivity detector. The product samples were injected into a Poropak PS column and analyzed using a flame ionization detector. Preparation of films Appropriate quantities of [HRh(CO)(PPh3)3] and PPh3 were dissolved in THF along with the cellulose acetate or poly(phenylsulfone) polymer. The solutions were adjusted to 10 15% polymer content and then were cast in the usual fashion [3], providing films about 0.6-1.5 mil thick. After brief air drying the films were cured at 65 C overnight, preferably in a vacuum oven. Procedure The solvent-free films were cut into strips approximately 0.25 in XI.5 in and pressed into the glass reactor tube. The reactor was sealed and swept out with nitrogen, then the proportioner was swept with the reactant gases to establish a mixture consisting preferably of 40% olefin, 35% CO and 25% hydrogen. The minimum gas rate was ~25 ml min~1, although lower rates could be obtained by bleeding through a bypass. The temperature was then raised to 80-90 C. Several hours were required to attain steady state conditions. Small leaks in the serum caps of the sample vials were a constant source of concern. In shutdowns the reactor was cooled to ~ 50 C, at which point the flow of CO and Hg was stopped. N3 was introduced and on further cooling to ambient temperature the olefin flow was stopped. A test strip of film in the reactor was examined by IR, then returned to the reactor which was kept under N2. In cases where oxygen was not rigorously excluded, there was noticeable darkening of the film, accompanied by the formation of triphenylphosphine oxide and gradual loss of catalytic activity. 216 Results and discussion In preliminary experiments with various forms of THF-soluble rhodium complexes, the simple salt RhCl3 was incorporated into cellulose acetate films. It was expected that in the presence of synthesis gas this salt would be converted into an active hydroformylation catalyst. Under our flow condi- tions at 80 C, RhCIa was converted to [RhCCC^gClla but this dimeric complex sublimed out of the film and condensed on cold surfaces. In order to fix this rhodium complex in the film, the dimer was dissolved in THF solutions of copolymers of polystyrene (or methyl methacrylate) with 2-vinylpyridine*. Using this support, no loss of rhodium occurred but such films were not catalytically active. When polyC4-vmylpyridine) and its copolymers were dissolved in THF for the preparation of films, the addition of the [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 resulted in gel formation, probably because of crosslinking through the rhodium complex. To avoid gel formation, successful rhodium incorporation was achieved by depositing [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 vapor onto an existing film. Al- ternatively, the films were immersed in an aqueous solution containing the Rh dimer and the water-soluble phosphine PhgPCgP^Sf^Na. However neither of these films was an effective catalyst. Attention was then turned to the readily available and THF-soluble complex [HRhCCOXPPI^]. There have been many studies of the hydroformylation of olefins using [HRh(CO)(PPh3)3J as the actual or precursor catalyst. When dissolved, this complex readily dissociates and excess phosphine is usually required for good catalytic behavior. The catalytic cycle that is generally accepted for the conversion of terminal olefins to aldehydes has been published previously [8]. A variety of complexes are probably present simultaneously in solution, involving 4- and 5-coordination (16- and 18-electron species) with one or two COs and one, two or three PPI^s. Also present may be some dimeric rhodium species, including the complex [RhCCOXPPI^gjg which has been shown to be catalytically inactive [9]. Although the use of membranes in a suitable configuration could conceiv- ably function both to separate reactants from products as well as catalyst support, and indeed in one instance has reportedly been so employed in the [HRh(CO)(PPh3)3]-catalyzed hydroformylation of ethylene [10], in our work we have investigated only conditions where the membrane serves as a support**. Ethylene hydroformylation The results of ethylene hydroformylation with cellulose acetate films are summarized in Table 1. The slight variations in the composition of feed gas were inadvertent and were characteristic of our rather crude flow control system. The results show that even after 310 h (13 days) the turnover rate *Fyfe et al. [ 7 ] used a Pt complex coordinated to poly(4-vinylpyridine) for hydroformylation. **Thomton and Gates [11] sulfonated a pre-formed crosslinked polystyrene membrane and used it to catalyze the dehydration of alcohols. 217 TABLE 1 Ethylene hydrofonnylation with a rhodium-containing film' Time (\") Feed rate (ml min\" i\" Reac1) tants (9 <)) Ethylene i (mmol h~ ate Products') i (mol%) TV C2 CO Ha Ethane Propana 1 12 38 44 30 26 44 0.08 3.1 12 23 23 44 27 30 27 0.37 11.4 27 25 19 38 36 26 19 0.15 11.4 19 47 30 35 38 27 28 0.10 9.0 22 143 23 40 29 31 24 0.27 11.8 25 145 28 34 36 30 25 0.13 11.1 25 166 13 43 23 34 15 1.05 15.0 20 190 27 37 35 29 27 0.12 8.4 20 191 34 37 35 29 33 0.12 8.7 26 214 36 36 35 29 34 0.12 8.9 27 310 36 38 34 29 36 0.15 9.6 31 \"4.62 g cellulose acetate film ~ 1 mil thick containing 105 mg of [HRhCO(PhaP)3] (0.114 mmol)) and 317 mg of PhyP (1.20 mmol). \"At 815 torr and 82 2 C. Turnover rate equals mols ethylene converted to propanal per mol rhodium per hour. of ~25 mol ethylene converted to propanal per mol rhodium per hour remained essentially constant, indicating no loss of catalytic activity over this long period*. There is no reason to believe that the reaction would not continue indefinitely, providing that an oxygen free environment is maintained. No attempt was made to optimize the turnover rate by increased loading of the catalyst or by varying flow rate, temperature, or gas composition. However, when the feed mixture is rich in hydrogen extensive hydrogenation to ethane occurs. Under the usual conditions, as given in Table 1, there is very little reduction of the propanalto propanol. Furthermore, although hydrofonnylation of ethylene ordinarily gives appreciable amounts of diethyl ketone, such did not appear to be the case under our conditions. This aspect was not studied. Propylene hydrofonnylation The results with propylene are shown in Table 2. The turnover rate with propylene is about an order of magnitude less than with ethylene.** We believe that the slower rate of diffusion of propylene through the film is largely responsible for this difference, because experiments in solution showed very little difference in rate between the homologous olefins (vide infra). \"dark et al. [12] reported a similar turnover rate under certain conditions for the hydrogenation of styrene over a supported phosphinated polystyrene-anchored platinum catalyst. **Wender et al. [13] report on the effect of structure on rate of hydrofonnylation for a large number of oleflns under a standard set of conditions but do not include propylene and ethylene. 218 TABLE 2 Propylene hydroformylation with a rhodium-containing film' Time Feed rate\" Reactants (%) Olefin rate Products Ratio Tr0 (h) (ml min\"1) (mmol h~1) (mol% aldehydes) n:iso 2 28 47 27 26 35 24 38 43 34 23 43 50 21 51 21 28 28 121 26 44 29 27 30 145 35 45 34 22 42 19111 29 35 39 27 27 21611 25 45 29 26 30 312'1 26 45 31 24 31 0.48 1.5 0.26 0.87 3.3 4.3 0.05 0.78 15.6 2.0 0.08 0.98 12.3 2.8 0.06 0.67 10.5 2.7 0.09 1.05 12.1 2.7 0.07 1.05 14.2 3.0 0.02 0.98 49 2.7 a- \"Same as in Table 1. ''Turnover rate equals mols olefln converted to products per mol rhodium per hour. ''Reactor temperature 88 C. The commercial process for the hydroformylation of propylene is directed toward maximizing selectivity toward butanal, the straight chain C-4 aldehyde. For this purpose, the rhodium-catalyzed commercial reaction is carried out in molten PPha as solvent since high concentrations of this ligand typically lead to highest selectivity. Our films contained about 10 mol free PPha to 1 mol [HRh(CO)(PPh3)3] [2]. As seen in Table 2, the ratio of straight to branched chain 64 aldehydes was about 12 (corresponding to about 91% butanal and 9% 2-methylpropanal), which is approximately the ratio in the commercial process. This selectivity is not affected by increasing the PPhs content beyond 10 mol per mol Rh. One of the major advantages of the typical supported Rh catalyst system [14] is that it is not necessary to swamp the Rh catalyst with a large excess of PPhs, as is the case when it is used as a solvent, in order to obtain the high normal: iso ratio from propylene. In this respect our membrane-supported catalysts function like the solid- supported catalysts used heretofore. We also investigated poly (phenylsulf one): CH 0 {^H^^h^ CH, 0 CH3 0 as a support for the rhodium complex. Both cellulose acetate and polyCphenylsufone) are available as hollow fibers; were our hydroformylation results to be implemented as a commercial process, the hollow fiber confi- guration would be the obvious candidate for such use. Some results for the catalytic hydroformylation of propylene using the poly(phenylsulfone) film are shown in Table 3. Although the turnover rates are somewhat lower than those with cellulose acetate as the support, the 219 TABLE 3 Hydroformylation of propylene over a poly(phenylsulfone) film\" Time Gas rate\" Reactants (%) Propylene rate Aldehydes (%) Ratio Tr\" (h) (ml mm\"1) (mmol h~1) n:iso Cg CO Ha isoC4 nC4 92 27 48 24 28 34 0.038 0.89 23 1.1 95 28 48 24 28 35 0.049 0.936 19 1.2 119 26 45 26 29 31 0.053 1.094 21 1.2 142 24 38 30 32 25 0.059 1.057 18 1.0 '6.38 g of film containing 265 mg (0.289 mmol) of [HRh(CO)(PhaP)3] and 800 mg (3.06 mmol) of PhgP at 98 C and 815 torr. ''Turnover rate equals mol aldehydes per mol rhodium per hour. n:iso ratio (> 15) of the aldehydes is very favorable. In order to determine whether PPha or Rh is lost from the film, it was analyzed for S, Rh and P before and after 900 h of operation and essentially no change in composition was noted. It is of considerable interest to compare the hydroformylation of olefins in our catalyst-supported system with the reaction of olefins in homogeneous hydroformylation. For this purpose we dissolved [HRh(CO)(PPh3)3] in 2- methylnaphthalene (this high-boiling solvent was chosen to minimize solvent loss) and bubbled our gases through the solution at approximately the same rate as we used in the gas phase reaction over the films. The results are summarized in Table 4. With ethylene the turnover rate with the film C~24) is a good bit higher than that obtained with the soluble catalyst (~5). With propylene, the turnover rate (~3) with the film support is about equal to that obtained with the soluble catalyst (~4). Our solution experiments were designed to simulate the membrane experiments, including operation at subatmospheric pressures of synthesis gas. The normal homogeneous hy- droformylation is carried out at much higher pressures and of course with resultant larger turnover numbers*. Although the films contained a large excess of PPh3 and the initial solution experiments involved no extra PPhs, the addition of PPhs near the end of the solution experiment Cast line of data in Table 4) did not affect the turnover rate. As expected, the ratio of normaLiso aldehyde increased appreciably. One may conclude on the basis of Tables 2, 3 and 4 that our film-supported catalyst can be as good as if not better than the conventional supported catalyst [4]. Infrared studies The films, cast as described above are suitable for direct infrared examination. However, the absorption of cellulose acetate is very strong in In [4] the authors found that, in autoclave experiments, relatively high temperatures and pressures were required to achieve the same turnover rate in the hydroformylation of 1-pentene with an anchored HRh(CO)(PPh3)3 catalyst as was obtained with a homogeneous system under much milder conditions. 220 TABLE 4 Hydrofonnylation with a soluble rhodium complex' Time Feed rate % Olefin Olefln rate Products (mol%) Ratio Tr\" (h) (ml mill\"1) (mmol h~1) n;iso Ca Cy propanol aldehydes 23 25 34 23 0.03 12.1 6.4 47 25 33 22 14.5 7.3 d 0 0 48 26 33 23 6.8 3.6 0 0 72 20 30 16 0.11 10.5 3.9 96 14 36 13 0.32 16.4 4.9 145 15 32 13 0.05 8.2 2.5 169 21 41 23 5.7 2.6 0.46 4.4 192 21 41 23 3.3 2.1 0.64 2.9 215 27 44 32 3.2 2.9 0.91 4.5 216' 27 41 29 1.5 4.9 3.3 4.3 'A solution of 21 ml of 2-methylnaphthalene in a 50 ml flask containing 400 mg (0.435 mmol) [HRh(CO)(Ph3P)3] at 80 C. \"Remainder of feed: 1.4 Ha: 1CO; pressure 815 torr.

Before use in the catalytic reactions, the film showed a strong Rh carbonyl band at 1970 cm\"1. This band persisted on continued use of the film under all reaction conditions. This band is not present in the IR spectrum of a KBr pellet of the original crystalline [HRh(CO)(PPh3)3], which has its strongest carbonyl band at 1921 cm\"1. However, the pure cellulose acetate (CA) film has a strong absorption at 1924 cm\"1 and hence the presence of the 1921 cm~1 band of the original complex (if present in the film) may be hidden under the broad CA band in the same region. It is well known that [HRhCCOXPPha)^ dissociates very readily, especially in solution. The 1584 cm~1 band, characteristic of free, PPhg, is present in the spectrum of the solid complex as well as in its solution spectrum. However, once incorporated into the CA film in the presence of excess PPhs, the complex seems very stable for very long reaction times. When care was not taken to exclude oxygen from the reaction system, the 721 cm\"! band characteristic of PPhgP=0 increased, as might have been expected. However, when oxygen was excluded during the reaction, the intensity of the 721 cm\"1 remained essentially constant. 221 Acknowledgement This work was supported in part by the Membrane Technology Center, Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Cincinnati.

Films prepared from THF solutions containing cellulose acetate, [HRh(CO)(PPh3)3] and PPh3 were tested for catalytic activity in the vapor phase hydroformylation of ethylene and propylene: RCH=CH2+CO+H2→RCH2CH2CHO. The reaction proceeded smoothly at 800 ton- and 80 °C. Turnover rates were about 25 mol propanai per mol Rh per h. No loss of PPh3 or Rh from the film was observed even after long periods of reaction. The excess PPh3 seemed to stabilize the catalytic activity of the film but concentrations beyond 10 molar produced no further improvement. The turnover rate with the films was equal to or even slightly higher than that obtained under similar conditions using a homogeneous solution of [HRh(CO)PPh3] in 2-methylmaphthalene solvent. The turnover rate for propylene to C-4 aldehydes was about an order of magnitude smaller than that for ethylene to propanal. Films prepared from poly(phenylsulfone) were also active catalysts. The ratio of n/iso C-4 aldehydes with this support was about 20. In the absence of oxygen the catalyst system retained its activity for more than 13 days but no attempt was made to test for longer lifetimes. The use of polymeric films or membranes as a support for the rhodium catalysis of the hydroformylation reaction thus appears to hold considerable promise. References 1 a For reviews see F.R.
