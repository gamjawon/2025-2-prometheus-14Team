Graphical abstract Improving utilization of precious metals is one of the crucial challenges for electrochemical energy catalysis. Tuning precious metal structure to expose active sites is an effective strategy to reduce mass loading in the practical application. Herein, Pt-Co hollow nanospheres were synthesized via a sequential reduction strategy using amorphous Co-B-O complex as the key spheres-forming intermediates. The modulation mechanism of Pt-Co hollow nanospheres formation was established by investigating critical factors of addition sequence of reducing agent, the type of reducing agents and the ratio of Pt and Co precursors. The optimized Pt-Co hollow nanospheres with the Pt/Co molar ratio of 1:1 by this method is characterized by the average diameter of around 30 nm and the shell thickness of 2.3 nm. They displays superior performance for enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the aspect of activity and stability in 0.5 M H2SO4, in which the mass activity of the Pt-Co hollow spheres exhibits 2.82 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C and its stability also has a significant enhancement. The outstanding activity of the Pt-Co hollow nanospheres for HER is mainly attributed to its highly accessible electron/mass transport path, expose active sites on the ultra-thin shells and strain effect induced by the hollow sphere structure. This hollow nanospheres with ultra-thin shell provides a promising way to develop highly efficient precious metal based electrocatalysts. Keywords Pt-Co hollow nanospheres Ultra-thin shell Amorphous Co-B-O complex Sequential reduction Hydrogen evolution reaction 1 Introduction Nowadays, electrocatalysis plays a critical role in green and renewable energy systems such as fuel cells, metal-air batteries and water electrolyzers [1–3]. Platinum (Pt) based catalysts have been widely applied in the field of electrocatalysis for enhancing hydrogen oxidation reactions (HOR) [4], hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) [5], and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) [6], as well as alcohol oxidation reaction (MOR) [7] due to their efficient electrochemical activity. However, the resource scarcity and high cost of Pt hinders the widespread application of these green and renewable energy systems. Therefore, improving the utilization of Pt is of great importance for the development of green energy conversion technologies [8]. In recent years, many attentions on morphology-controlled synthesis of super nanostructures of Pt-based composites (e.g. hollow nanospheres [9], core-shell [10], nanowires [11], nanochain [12], nanoflower [13], framework [14]) to replace the conventional carbon supported Pt nanoparticles with a fine particle size of 3–5 nm have been widely paid to further improve Pt electrochemical activity and stability due to their specific surface properties controlled by both shapes and electronic effects. Among them, the hollow nanostructures possess some unique advantages of highly open dimension and effective space utilization of active sites, which exactly reduce the electron and mass transport path as well as accelerate the catalytic process, leading to electrochemical activity improvement, compare to solid nanoparticles (NP) [15]. To date, there are two main methods employed to synthesize Pt based hollow nanostructures using a sacrificed template, including galvanic replacement [16] and chemical etching treatment [17]. For example, Pt-Cu hollow nanocrystals for methanol electro-oxidation were synthesized via a galvanic replacement method, in which the metallic Cu nanoparticles as cores were synthesized first, after that, Pt4+ was added and displaced by the metallic Cu cores into hollow Pt nanospheres [18]. Pt-Fe hollow spheres were obtained by depositing Pt-Fe nanoparticles on surface-modified silica particles as inert growing templates. After the removal of templates of the silica particles by sodium hydroxide, the shell thickness and spheres size of Pt-Fe hollow spheres are about 10 nm and 400 nm respectively [19]. Generally, the shells of hollow spheres by the two methods are commonly composed of Pt agglomerated nanoparticles with the average size of 5–7 nm, demonstrating efficient Pt utilization owing to its exposed high electrochemical surface area provided by hollow structures [20,21], highlighting the crucial role of shell thickness in electrocatalysis. However, there is still a big concern on the process of dissolution and redeposition or/and subsequent migration induced by Ostwald ripening effect involved in the such structured hollow spheres during the practical application, which is similar to the occurrence in Pt nanoparticles on carbon catalyst, leading to undesirable stability [22]. Therefore, developing a new kind of hollow spheres with ultrathin continuous shells would be feasible to address this issue; In addition, the electrocatalytic activity of the hollow spheres for specific reaction application is strongly affected by the composition, thickness and surface lattice structure of the shell as well as the size of spheres [23,24]. Although hollow-structured Pt based catalysts have been explored for ORR, OER and MOR, few reports studied the synthesis of hollow spheres for HER, which is the key reaction for producing ultra-high purity of hydrogen via overall electrochemical water splitting reaction [25,26]. In this work, we report a kind of Pt-Co hollow nanospheres with ultra-thin shell, which is synthesized via a sequential reduction strategy using amorphous Co-B-O complex as intermediates. Some critical factors including the sequence of reducing agent, the kind of reducing agent, the ratio of Pt and Co precursors are explored to reveal the modulation mechanism of Pt-Co hollow nanospheres. Their electrochemcial activities are measured for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 0.5 M H2SO4. Besides, the ΔGH* values of H adsorption on Pt (1 1 1) plane of PtCo alloy with different atomic ratio of Pt and Co and metallic Pt is calculated by DFT to clarify the structure–activity relationship. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Chemicals Cobaltous acetate (C4H6CoO4·4(H2O), 99%), polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP, 99%), sodium borohydride (NaBH4, 98%) and chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O) were purchased from Aladdin. 2.2 Preparation of Pt-Co hollow nanospheres In a typical synthesis, 12 mg of C4H6CoO4·4H2O and 200 mg of PVP were dissolved in 60 ml of ultrapure water (18.2 MΩ) to form the reddish solution under magnetic stirring. After that, 50 ml of NaBH4 solution (4 mg mL−1) was poured into the C4H6CoO4·4H2O solution and held for a few seconds to get a black-grey suspension. Subsequently, 40 ml of H2PtCl6 solution (0.125–0.625 mgPt mL−1) were immediately added and stirred until to no production of gas bubbles. Finally, the black product was washed thoroughly using hot water followed by drying process. 2.3 Materials characterization Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and elemental distribution spectrometer (EDS) mapping were captured using a TITAN G2 microscope (FEI, USA) at 300 kV. The crystal structure and lattice parameters of Pt-Co hollow nanospheres were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, Smartlab Rigaku, Japan) which was operated with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5405 Å) at 40 kV and 30 mA. The chemical state of Pt-Co hollow nanospheres was acquired through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS ESCALAB 250XI+) with an ESCALAB 250 Xi (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) using a monochromatic Al X-ray source. The content of Pt and Co in catalyst is analyzed via the inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP PerkinElmer Optima 8000DV ICP-OES, USA). The images of samples morphologies were also obtained by the Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi SU8220). 2.4 Electrochemical performance measurements The electrochemical activity of Pt-Co hollow nanospheres for HER was measured in a three-electrode electrolytic cell using biopotentiostat (Pine, USA) equipped with a rotational disk electrode (RDE) system, in which a glassy carbon electrode covered with a thin film of catalyst was used as the working electrode, a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a graphite rod electrode were employed as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. To evaluate the HER performance, Pt-Co hollow nanospheres, Pt nanoparticles and PtCo nanoparticles were mixed with Vulcan XC-72 carbon black (mass ratio is 1:1). 3.0 mg of the catalyst was dispersed in 2 ml of solution (1.5 ml of water, 0.48 ml of ethyl alcohol and 0.02 ml of 5 wt% Nafion). The electrodes had a metal (Pt–Co alloy or Pt) loading of 35.71 µg cm−2. The hydrogen linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was recorded in N2-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 solution at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The accelerated durability tests (ADTs) were conducted in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution through performing cyclic potential sweeps between −0.2 and 0.1 V vs. RHE at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 for 5000 cycles. Moreover, chronopotentiometry (CP) curves also reflected the durability of catalysts, which was recorded at −10 mA cm−2 for 5 h. In this work, all electrochemical measurements were carried out at room temperature. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were acquired by the electrochemical workstation (IM6) with applied bias of 5.0 mV and frequencies between 10 mHz and 100 kHz. 3 Results and discussions 3.1 Synthesis process of Pt-Co hollow nanospheres Fig. 1 a schematically illustrates the synthesis process of Pt-Co hollow nanospheres using a sequential reduction method, in which, Cobalt acetate tetrahydrate (C4H6CoO4·4H2O) as the Co source was reacted first with sodium borohydride (NaBH4) in the presence of PVP to form Co-B-O complex (a kind of intermediates consisting of Co, B and O). After 30 s, chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) solution rapidly added into the above mixed solution to obtain Pt-Co hollow nanospheres. Fig. 1b-g shows the morphology and fine structure of such Pt-Co hollow nanospheres synthesized by this method using Pt and Co precursors with the atomic ratio of 1:1. The TEM images as shown in Fig. 1b exactly exhibits their spherical and hollow structure with the diameter of around 50–60 nm and the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) (Fig. 1b insert) clearly shows four bright concentric rings for Pt-Co hollow nanospheres, which are well ascribed to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1) planes of Pt-Co hollow nanospheres respectively, reflecting their polycrystalline characteristics [27]. The HADDF-STEM image further provides an evidence of hollow structure (Fig. 1c). Fig. 1d shows an individual Pt-Co hollow nanosphere with the sphere size about 40 nm and EDS analysis with the line-scanning measurement mode (Fig. 1d insert) indicates that the shell consists of homogenous Pt and Co and their atomic ratio is 1:1. Fig. 1e, f, g show high magnification TEM images of three selected areas (marked by circles) in Fig. 1d, wherein there are ultra-thin shells with the shell thickness of 2.23, 2.26, 2.28 nm for the three areas respectively, encompassing about 9–11 atomic layers. And the fringe pattern of shells displays a lattice spacing of 0.223 nm, which is slightly smaller than 0.23 nm of the (1 1 1) plane of standard metallic Pt, indicating that the formation of Pt-Co alloy due to the lattice contraction of the incorporation of Co atoms into Pt lattice [28]. Meanwhile, it should be noted that the shell is continuous layer, not made up of the conventional nanoparticles. This kind of ultra-thin layer would significantly improve the stability of hollow nanospheres during use. To reveal the mechanism of Pt-Co hollow nanospheres formation, we first investigated the fine structure of the intermediates produced by the reaction between C4H6CoO4·4H2O and NaBH4. As shown in Fig. 2 a, the intermediates have a flower like structure, consisting of cross-linked nanoplates, and the selected area electron diffraction (Fig. 2a insert) shows no obvious diffraction spots, indicating the amorphous structural properties of the intermediates. Meanwhile, their XRD patterns (Fig. 2b) also verify the nature of amorphous state due to no XRD diffraction peaks. The chemical composition and valence state of the intermediates were determined by XPS. From the full survey scan spectra (Fig. S1), the intermediates mainly comprise Co, B and O elements and their atomic percentage of is 25.1%, 9.3%, 66.65% for Co, B, and O, respectively. In the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Co 2p (Fig. 2c), there are four characteristic peaks, which are located at around 780.6 eV and 796.5 eV, contributing to Co 2p 3/2 and Co 2p 1/2 respectively and their corresponding satellite peaks at 786.4 eV and 802.9 eV, respectively. The peak of Co 2p 3/2 can be further split into three peaks at 779.8, 780.7 and 782.0 eV, respectively, which would be attributed to borides, cobalt hydroxides and borates of cobalt in the intermediates, respectively [29,30]. Their atomic content calculated based on the areas of corresponding peaks in the Co 2p 3/2 is 20%, 44.9% and 35.0%, respectively, indicating that the majority of Co species in the intermediates is the type of Co(OH)2. As shown in Fig. 2d, the B 1s spectrum of the intermediates can be divided into two distinct peaks at 187.6 and 191.4 eV, which are from BO2 − and Co-B, respectively [31]. Correspondingly, B species is dominant by BO2 − (84.3%) rather than Co-B (15.7%). The two fitted peaks in the O 1s spectrum (Fig. 2e) at 531.0 eV and 529.8 eV are contributed to hydroxide ion in metal hydroxides and metal oxides [29,32], and their content are 90.67% and 9.3%, respectively, demonstrating that O species are mainly from of hydroxide ion. Through the above XPS analysis, it is plausible to speculate that the intermediates are the mixture of CoB, Co(OH)2 and Co(BO2)2, which are assembled into a flower structure through the molecular interaction. Herein, the intermediates is labeled as Co-B-O complex. Fig. 2f shows TEM images of Pt-Co hollow nanospheres prepared using the typical preparation process without PVP. Interestingly, they still exhibit hollow spherical structure with a broader sphere size distribution, even if no PVP was used, indicating that the formation of hollow nanospheres is critically controlled by the Co-B-O complex. By comparing with the uniformly distribution and smaller size of Pt-Co hollow spheres prepared in the presence of PVP (Fig. 1b), it illustrates that PVP facilitates the growth of more homogeneous nanospheres as a stabilizing agent [33] rather than the main driving force of the formation of hollow spherical structure. The critical role of the Co-B-O intermediates in the sequential reduction method was further evidenced by the experiment that C4H6CoO4·4H2O and H2PtCl6 with the PVP was reduced simultaneously by NaBH4. As shown in Fig. 2g, the Pt-Co nanocomposites prepared by the co-reduction method demonstrate an aggregate of Pt-Co nanoparticles with the particle size of around 5 nm because of the no formation of Co-B-O complex in the process. Besides, when hydrazine hydrate (30 ml, 80 wt%) as a reducing agent instead of NaBH4 in the sequential reduction method, the PtCo nanochains were formed after H2PtCl6 added, as shown in Fig. 2f. The lattice spacing of PtCo nanochain (Fig. 2f insert) is about 0.221 nm, also demonstrating that the formation of Pt-Co alloy. Generally, both the sequence of adding precursors and different reducing agent experimental results confirm that the sequential reduction strategy via the formation of the intermediates of amorphous Co-B-O complex as the structure-directing seeds is crucial to form hollow nanospheres. It should be noted that the discovery of the role of Co-B-O complex in our case is different from the viewpoint of metal borides as sacrificial templates for the synthesis of the previously reported PtNi hollow nanospheres [34], mostly like due to the difference of reaction conditions. In our sequential method, by the comprehensive analysis of XRD and XPS results, the possible reactions between C4H6CoO4·4H2O and NaBH4 would occur as following chemical reaction equations: (1) 2Co(C2H3O2)2 + 4NaBH4 + 9H2O − Co2B + 4CH3COONa + 12.5H2 + 3B(OH)3 (2) NaBH4 + 2H2O − NaBO2 + 4H2 (3) NaBO2 + H2O − BO2H + NaOH (4) Co2+ + 2OH− − Co(OH)2 (5) 2Co2+ + PtCl6 2− + BH4− + 8OH− = 2Co + Pt + BO2 − + 6H2O + 6Cl− The Co-B-O complex as the intermediates grown via the reaction (1)–(4) are comprised of Co2B, Co(BO2)2 and Co(OH)2. After that, they are employed as the basic frameworks, when chloroplatinic acid is added, PtCl6 2– collides with Co-B-O flowers and are co-reduced by the excessive NaBH4 to form a PtCo alloy shell, as described in Eq. (5), due to the fact that Co2+ and Pt4+ can share a portion of the electron cloud in their empty orbital [35]. Additionally, the forming mechanism of Pt-Co hollow nanospheres can be explained by the so called room temperature Kirkendall Effect [36]. During the dissolution process of Co-B-O flowers caused by reduction reaction, the thermal energy at room temperature is high enough to motivate a sufficiently large fluctuation in shell, leaving a pinhole for further mass diffusion transportation to keep the proceeding of co-reduction of Pt and Co until to the exhaustion of Co-B-O cores. In addition, there is a non-ignorable factor that reduced Pt would continue to catalyze the growth of PtCo shell, inducing the formation of layer structure rather than particles [35]. To explore one more key influencing factor for modulating the hollow structure, Pt-Co nanocomposites were prepared using various atomic ratios of H2PtCl6 and C4H6CoO4·4H2O with the ratio range from 1:5 to 5:1. The corresponding samples obtained were noted as Pt1Co5, Pt1Co3, Pt1Co2, Pt1Co1, Pt4Co1, Pt5Co1. Fig. 3 displays their morphology, nanosphere size distribution, XRD, and XPS results. As shown in Fig. 3a, TEM observation shows that the sample with the ratio of 1:5 shows aggregates of nanoparticles. As for the ratio of 1:3 (Fig. 3b), they seem to present a tendency of hollow sphere due to the presence of layer structure. Meanwhile, it can be found that the hollow nanospheres were successfully synthesized with the increase of the ratio more than 1:2 (Fig. 3c, d, e, f). The sphere size is around 110 nm for Pt1Co2 (Fig. 3c) and 60 nm Pt1Co1 (Fig. 3d and g), which is further down to 30 nm for Pt4Co1 (Fig. 3e and h), however, the sphere size is becoming up to 75 nm for Pt5Co1 (Fig. 3f and i). The significantly different sphere size of PtCo nanospheres caused by the ratio of Pt and Co precursor may be due to their nucleation process [37]. Lower Pt salt ratio mean less nucleation amount, leading to a larger sphere size. With the increase of Pt ratio to the optimized value, smallest size is obtained. In our case, the best ratio of Pt to Co precursor is 4. However, when more concertation of Pt salt is added, too many small PtCo crystals obtained are to grow up to a big size under the effect of Oswald ripening and Coalescence process [38]. Meanwhile, STEM-EDS mapping analysis of individual hollow nanosphere obtained using various atomic ratio of Pt and Co precursors demonstrates that every Pt-Co hollow nanospheres have the Pt/Co ratio of around 1:1, most likely because of the control of thermodynamics for the formation of hollow nanospheres. The detailed comparison was listed in Fig. S2a-f and Table S1. However, their corresponding ICP results present the atomic ratio of Pt and Co are more than 1:1 in Pt4Co1 (74.1:25.9) and Pt5Co1 (67.7:32.3) (Table S1), indicating that the partial Pt nanoparticles reduced by NaBH4 exists on the shell confirm by the TEM images shown in Fig. S3. In addition, the shell thickness for Pt1Co1, Pt4Co1 and Pt5Co1 hollow spheres is all around 2.25 nm, suggesting no effect of precursor ratio on shell thickness. The lattice distance of Pt-Co (Pt1Co1, Pt4Co1, Pt5Co1) hollow nanosphere (Fig. 3d, e, f insert) is about 0.225, 0.225, 0.223 nm, which is between pure Co (0.205 nm) and Pt (1 1 1) (0.23 nm). The XRD diffraction patterns of commercial Pt/C, Pt nanoparticles, PtCo nanoparticles and Pt-Co hollow spheres were shown in Fig. 3j. Comparing to Commercial Pt/C and Pt nanoparticles (located at 39.78°), PtCo nanoparticles (located at 40.10°) have a positive shift of about 0.32°, which means that the interatomic distances between adjacent Pt sites is decreased by the introduction of Co atom. Meanwhile, the Pt-Co hollow nanospheres (located at 40.60°) occurs 0.5° positive shift with respect to PtCo nanoparticles, indicating lattice compression occurred in hollow nanospheres [39]. The lattice contraction was estimated from the position of the (2 2 0) diffraction peak on PtCo nanoparticles and Pt-Co hollow nanospheres. As shown in Table S1, compared with commercial Pt/C, the lattice parameter in Pt of PtCo nanoparticles has 0.97% contraction, Pt1Co1, Pt4Co1 and Pt5Co1 hollow nanospheres show 1.48%, 2.07% and 1.82% shrinkage, respectively, demonstrating the theoretic strain occurs in the formation process of Pt-Co hollow nanospheres [40,41]. Also, the average crystallite size of Pt4Co1 of around 1.569 nm is the smallest than other nanocomposites. The change in crystallite size is consistent with the degree of lattice compression, in which the higher the degree in lattice compression, the smaller the crystallite size is. The strain induced by the alloying of the appropriate Pt and Co allows the modulation of the average d-band occupations, thus leading to a different electrochemical performance [42]. In order to understand the surface strain of the Pt-Co hollow nanospheres, Pt nanoparticles, Commercial Pt/C, PtCo nanopsrticles and Pt-Co hollow nanospheres were further characterized by XPS measurements. Fig. 3k shows the XPS spectra of Pt 4f, in which the two intense peaks at 71.5 and 74.8 eV in the respective Pt 4f 7/2 and Pt 4f 5/2 peaks are from the characteristic of metallic Pt [43]. The two more fitted peaks at 72.3 and 76.1 eV can be assigned to the oxidized Pt [44], which may be from the interaction between metallic Pt and absorbed oxygen, respectively. For PtCo nanoparticles, the Pt 4f 7/2 signal shifts positively compared to that of Pt nanoparticles and commercial Pt/C, indicating the occurrence of the electron transfer from Co to Pt. As for Pt-Co hollow nanospheres, the positions of Pt 4f 7/2 peaks locate at 71.50, 71.51, and 71.57 eV for Pt1Co1, Pt4Co1, Pt5Co1 hollow nanospheres, respectively, which further shifts positively with respect to PtCo nanoparticles on account of the compressive surface strain induced by the substrate Co [44]. Besides, the blue shift happened in Co 2p binding energies of Pt-Co hollow nanospheres (Fig. 3l), comparing to the pure Co, further implying the charge transfer from Co to Pt [45]. Therefore, the ratio of Pt and Co is crucial to the formation of uniform hollow nanospheres, the strain effect and the electron structure of Pt, which is beneficial for the electrocatalytic activity [25]. In fact, we also investigated the effect of Co-B-O complex growth time (0.5–30 min), the amount of NaBH4 (100–200 mg) as well as the content of PVP (0–300 mg) (Fig. S4-6). The results demonstrate that these factors do not make a more strong impact on the morphology of Pt-Co hollow nanospheres than the ratio of precursors, so this part of discussion is not described in the work. 3.2 Electrochemical measurements The HER performance of Pt-Co hollow nanospheres (Pt1Co1, Pt4Co1 and Pt5Co1), Pt nanoparticles, PtCo nanoparticles and commercial Pt/C catalyst were evaluated in N2-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. LSV curves with IR-correction were shown in Fig. 4 a. The Pt1Co1, Pt4Co1 and Pt5Co1 hollow nanospheres exhibit the superior catalytic activity among all the tested catalysts with a near zero onset potential. That means that they have very low activation polarization for HER at near equilibrium potential [46,47]. Therefore, the high onset potentials of the Pt-Co hollow nanospheres for HER is most likely due to the abundant active sites possessed by this kinds of hollow spherical structures, which facilitate the local hydronium ion transportation at the electrode–electrolyte interface and subsequent its adsorption and hydrogen desorption, resulting in the low activation polarization. The current density at 10 mA cm−2 (equals to a solar-to-hydrogen device with ~12% efficiency) is an another key parameter for evaluating activity of materials for HER [48]. The Pt1Co1, Pt4Co1 and Pt5Co1 hollow nanospheres afford a small overpotential of 16.0 mV, 14.8 mV and 16.5 mV at the current density of −10 mA cm−2 respectively. All of them is significantly higher than that of PtCo nanoparticles (21.1 mV) and Pt nanoparticles (21.5 mV), and even better than 17.6 mV of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Among all the tested materials, Pt4Co1 shows the best HER performance. The overpotential difference value between Pt4Co1 hollow nanospheres and commercial Pt/C at −100 mA cm−2 is 26.5 mV, implying that the lower energy consumption to achieve the same production of H2. On the other hand, the Tafel slope indicates an intrinsic property of catalysts to analyze the rate-determining step for HER [49]. As shown in the Fig. 4b, the Tafel slope of Pt1Co1, Pt4Co1 and Pt5Co1 hollow nanospheres (26.09, 27.45 and 28.97 mV dec−1) is lower than that of Pt/C (29.67 mV dec−1) and Pt-Co nanoparticles (34.53 mV dec−1), indicating that their HER follows the Volmer-Tafel mechanism (30 mV dec−1) [50]. EIS measurements at 0.0 V vs. RHE, as shown in Fig. 4c further verify that Pt Co hollow spheres display excellent HER performance, compared to the commercial Pt/C, PtCo nanoparticles and Pt nanoparticles due to their lower charge-transfer resistance (Rct), meaning a faster HER kinetics. In addition, the mass activity was calculated by normalizing Pt loading based on the overpotential (−0.062 V) at a current density of −100 mA cm−2 of commercial Pt/C. As shown in Fig. 4d, it can be seen that the mass activity of Pt1Co1, Pt4Co1 and Pt5Co1 hollow nanospheres is 5.41, 6.36, 4.50 A mgPt −1, which is about 3.35, 3.93, 2.78 times higher than PtCo nanoparticles (1.62 A mgPt −1), respectively and even is 2.4, 2.83, 2.0 times higher than commercial Pt/C (2.25 A mgPt −1), respectively, which also demonstrates the extraordinary electrocatalytic activity of Pt-Co hollow nanospheres. The Pt4Co1 hollow nanospheres show the best mass activity due to its smallest sphere size and same the shell thickness among Pt-Co hollow nanospheres prepared using various ratios of Pt/C precursors. HER stability of Pt4Co1 hollow nanospheres was also tested using ADTs for 5000 cycles and CP respectively. After 5,000 cycles, the HER activity loss of Pt4Co1 hollow nanospheres is almost ignorable, and the overpotential is only a negative shift of potential with 2.6 mV, compared to its initial value. The STEM-EDS images of Pt4Co1 hollow nanospheres after ADT test (Fig. S2g) also shows that the nanostructure and morphology is still kept unchanged and the content of Co is only slightly loss, demonstrating the excellent stability of the Pt-Co hollow nanospheres. In addition, As shown in Fig. 4e (CP curves at a current density of −10 mA cm−2), the Pt-Co hollow nanospheres have much more better stability than that of commercial Pt/C catalyst, in which the decay rate is 0.04 mV min−1 and 0.08 mV min−1 for Pt-Co hollow nanospheres and Pt/C respectively, indicating the structural stability of the hollow spheres. The reason why hollow structure shows superior stability is that compressive strain of atomic contraction has great impact on adsorption strength [22,40]. Comparing to previously reported Pt-based catalysts with various other morphologies of Pt based nanoflowers, nanochains and nanodandelions listed in Table 1 , the hollow nanospheres exhibit the outstanding catalytic performance due to efficient Pt atom utilization, the accessible space of mass and electron transport and strong strain effect. 3.3 Density functional theory (DFT) calculation To reveal the exact reason for the excellent HER activity of Pt-Co hollow spheres, Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH*) on (1 1 1) plane of PtCo alloy with various molar ratio of Pt and Co were calculated using DFT method (More details computation listed in Supporting Information). H-adsorption behaviors are of the most importance for HER. High Gibbs free energy (ΔGH* ˃ 0) means endothermic proton or electron transfer process, while low Gibbs free energy (ΔGH* < 0) refers to the strong H* binding on the catalyst surface or a sluggish H-releasing steps, indicating a slow hydrogen evolution process. For that, the ideal HER activity should be corresponding to the value of ΔGH* close to zero [51,52]. Fig. 5 a shows the optimization of H adsorption position of (1 1 1) plane of Pt-Co alloy. The energy profiles of HER pathway on the (1 1 1) facets of the Pt-Co alloy and metallic Pt was shown in Fig. 5b. It reasonably illustrate that the Pt-Co alloy structure is significantly improved for enhancing the HER activity due to a higher value of the ΔGH* than that of Pt (−0.290 eV). Interestingly, the Pt1Co1 alloy displays the highest ΔGH* value (−0.2393 eV), indicating its highest activity for HER. The DFT analysis is consistent with the experimental results, and both of them clearly suggest that the appropriate atomic ratio of Pt and Co can boost the interaction between adsorbed H* and Pt atoms, thereby allowing for maximum utilization of Pt on the Pt-Co shell as active sites for improving electrocatalytic HER activity. 4 Conclusion Pt-Co hollow nanospheres with ultra-thin shell have been successfully prepared via a sequential reduction strategy. The modulation mechanism of PtCo hollow nanospheres was investigated through adjusting critical factors including the sequence of reducing agent, the kind of reducing agents, and the ratio of Pt and Co etc. The amorphous Co-B-O complex grown in the sequential reduction process is crucial to form hollow nanospheres structure. Meanwhile, the ratio of Pt and Co precursors is also vital to form hollow nanospheres. The Pt-Co hollow nanospheres with the atomic ratio of 1:1 not only present a low overpotential of 14.8 mV vs. RHE at current density of −10 mA cm−2, but also exhibit superior stability in 0.5 M H2SO4, ranking among the top HER catalysts reported. And both the experimental and DFT analyses suggest that Pt-Co hollow nanospheres with ultra-thin shell and the 1:1 atomic ratio is attributed to the highly accessible electron, mass transport path, abundant expose active sites on ultra-thin shell and the strong strain effect, which are induced from the unique hollow nanosphere. The hollow nanospheres structure with ultra-thin shell is the promising structure for designing robust and efficient electrocatalysts.

        "dc:description": "Improving utilization of precious metals is one of the crucial challenges for electrochemical energy catalysis. Tuning precious metal structure to expose active sites is an effective strategy to reduce mass loading in the practical application. Herein, Pt-Co hollow nanospheres were synthesized via a sequential reduction strategy using amorphous Co-B-O complex as the key spheres-forming intermediates. The modulation mechanism of Pt-Co hollow nanospheres formation was established by investigating critical factors of addition sequence of reducing agent, the type of reducing agents and the ratio of Pt and Co precursors. The optimized Pt-Co hollow nanospheres with the Pt/Co molar ratio of 1:1 by this method is characterized by the average diameter of around 30 nm and the shell thickness of 2.3 nm. They displays superior performance for enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the aspect of activity and stability in 0.5 M H2SO4, in which the mass activity of the Pt-Co hollow spheres exhibits 2.82 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C and its stability also has a significant enhancement. The outstanding activity of the Pt-Co hollow nanospheres for HER is mainly attributed to its highly accessible electron/mass transport path, expose active sites on the ultra-thin shells and strain effect induced by the hollow sphere structure. This hollow nanospheres with ultra-thin shell provides a promising way to develop highly efficient precious metal based electrocatalysts.",
