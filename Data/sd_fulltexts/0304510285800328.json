Quantitative analysis of the reaction products (dihydrogen, formaldehyde, formaldehyde dimethyl acetal, ethylene glycol, 2,3-dimethyl- 2,3-butanediol, 2-propanol, 2-methyl-l,2-propanediol) showed that mass balance for hydrogen was established satisfactorily among them. In com- parison to the acetone-photosensitized reaction of methanoi, the observed product distribution could be characterized as follows: (1) the gas-phase product is almost pure dihydrogen (in comparison to being mainly methane) and (2) the yield of formaldehyde and formaldehyde dimethyl acetal is greatly increased (in comparison to the products being mainly 2-methy 1-1,2- propanediol and ethylene glycol). Introduction The dehydrogenation of methanoi (eqn. (1)) has attracted considerable interest, since the product has the merit of being free from water. CHsOH > HCHO + H, (l) If the reaction proceeds in the liquid phase, very mild conditions can be used for this endothennic process. Although homogeneous complex catalysts for the dehydrogenation of primary or secondary alcohols of high carbon chain length (>C-i) are known [1 - 6], their extension to methanoi has been unsuc- cessful to date. * Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/85/$3.30 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 260 Previously, we have found that photoirradiation greatly enhances the catalytic activity of rhodium/tin chloride complexes in the dehydrogenation of 2-propanol [7], and we present here the results on the photocatalysis of methanoi dehydrogenation in the presence of some noble metal com- plexes. Experimental All the reagents and solvents were of reagent grade, cis- Rh2Cl2(CO)2(dpm)2 [8], PdzC^dpm); [9], PdC^dpm) [10], Pt2Cl2(dpm)2 [II], Ir2(jU-S)(CO)2(dpm)2 [12], Mo^dpn^ [13] and Mo2(OAc)4 [14] were all prepared by literature methods (dpm = bis(diphenylphosphino)- methane). A methanoi solution containing an appropriate amount of the catalyst was deaerated by bubbling argon through it previous to reaction. The reactor was equipped with a thermometer and a reflux condenser to which a gas buret was attached. When the refluxing of the solution became stable, mea- surements of the gas-phase volume were commenced. Photo irradiation was carried out using a high-pressure mercury lamp (400 W, Riko Kagaku) con- tained in a Pyrex glass vessel inserted into the reactor. Gas-chromatographic analyses were undertaken using the following stationary phases: (1) molecular sieve 5A and Unibeads IS for the gas-phase components, and (2) Porapak-N and PEG 1000 for low- and high-boiling- point components in the liquid phase, respectively. Quantitative analysis of formaldehyde was performed by means of a colorimetric method [15]. Elec- tronic absorption spectra were measured by use of a recording spectro- photometer (Shimadzu UV-365) with a 1-cm pathlength quartz cell at ambient temperature. \"P NMR spectra were obtained with a Fourier trans- form pulsed NMR spectrometer (24.21 MHz, JEOL JNM-FX60Q), the chemical shifts reported being relative to an external 85% H3P04 reference with a negative sign indicating a shift to higher field. Results and discussion In the dark, both cis-Rh2Cl2(CO)2(dpm)2 and Pd2Cl2(dpm)2 exhibited no catalytic activity (67 C, 12 h; ii^ evolution not detectable by gas chro- matography), However, upon photoirradiation (400 W high-pressure mercury lamp), considerable evolution of gas was observed. The addition of acetone led to a considerable increase in the rate of gas evolution. Gas Chromato- graphie analysis of the gas phase component of the reaction revealed that the evolved gas was composed almost entirely of H2 (with a trace of CH4), in con- trast to the gas-phase products from a 9:1 mixture of methanol/acetone (total volume, 500 ml) under the same photoirradiation conditions where the relative abundances (in %) were 90.0 (CH4), 8.8 (CO) and 1.2 (H2) after a 261 reaction time of 7.5 h. The photo irradiation of methanoi alone led to no reaction at all. Figure 1 shows the typical time course of the photochemical dehydro- genation of methanoi in the presence of a rhodium or palladium complex catalyst. The presence of an induction period as well as the comparatively rapid deactivation of the catalyst should be noted for the palladium catalyst, although a higher activity is attained in this case. Table 1 gives a comparison of the catalytic activity of the two catalysts with and without the addition of acetone; virtually no activity was observed for the palladium catalyst in the absence of acetone. o 20 -( - --((-- 10 20 25 Time / h 30 Fig. l.

It was found that the mononuclear palladium catalyst also showed an induction period, and after exhibiting a maximum activity (95 turnover h~1, based on the total amount of the complex added) began to undergo deactivation some 10 h after the start of photoirradiation. The electronic spectra of the reaction solutions indicated that while the dinuclear and mononuclear complexes gave different spectra even after thermal treatment, photoirradiation con- verted them into a similar species whose absorption spectrum exhibited a shoulder at ca. 420 nm with absorbance expansion into the visible region (colored brown-yellow; Fig. 2). From the nature of its electronic absorption spectrum, this species may be a multinuclear cluster compound (or com- pounds) and it is this cluster which is responsible for the catalytic activity. As the activity of the catalyst decreased, a metallic precipitate gradually appeared. In the rhodium case, where no induction period was observed, the char- acteristic peak of c;'s-Rh2Cl2(CO)2(dpm)2 (Xmax = 441 nm) persisted through- out the whole photoreaction period (Fig. 3). It is, however, noticeable from Fig. 3 that the absorbance also gradually expands into the visible with this e 0.4 400 450 Wavelength / mil 400 450 Wavelength / nm Fig. 2.

In this case after prolonged photoirradiation, the absorption expansion became so marked as to exceed the original absorbance at 441 nm. Concentration and drying of this solution in vacuo gave a black-brown solid which was completely soluble in CHzClz. The \"P NMR spectrum of this CHiCl; solution at room temperature exhibited three major peaks with 6 values ('JRhp values in Hz) of 18.1 (115), 18.9 (114) and 19.7 (117) ppm, respectively. Since cis-Rh^Cl^(CO)y,(dpm)^ gives a doublet at 25.4 ppm (^Rhp = 103 Hz) at room temperature (fluxional), the three observed peaks may be ascribed to cluster compounds. Since no peak corresponding to uncoordinated dpm was detectable in the spectrum, the formation of metallic rhodium at this stage appears most unlikely. After the reaction, the following products were shown to be present in the liquid phase: formaldehyde (1), formaldehyde dimethyl acetal (2), ethylene glycol (3), 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-butanediol (4), 2-propanol (5) and 2- methyl-l,2-propanediol (6). In order that products 1 -6 should be formed, the processes of dehydrogenation, C C coupling and intermolecular hydro- gen transfer must be involved in a complex manner. From the viewpoint of mass balance for hydrogen, the products can be formally classified as in Scheme 1.

In view of the error limit (^3%) involved in the analysis of each product, the postulated stoichiometry for hydrogen seems to be satisfactory. The product distribution in Table 2 is quite different from that obtained by photoirradiation of a 9:1 methanol/acetone mixture (total vol- ume, 500 ml) alone under the same reaction conditions (when the relative abundances (in %) were 0.9 (1), 29.0 (3), 4.4 (4), 27.5 (5) and 38.2 (6) with a reaction time of 7.5 h) and shows a marked preference for 1 (+ 2) over the other products. Thus, it is evident that the catalyst does participate in the overall reaction, even if the emission from the high-pressure mercury lamp contributes in part in exciting acetone (n ff*) as an initial step in the photo- chemical process. As far as the selectivity to 1 (+ 2) is concerned, the higher value in the presence of the palladium catalyst is noteworthy. The rate of H^ evolution has been determined for both methanoi and 2-propanol [16] at various temperatures, using the rhodium catalyst which showed relatively constant catalytic activity (cf. Fig. 1). From the resulting Arrhenius plot (Fig. 4), the apparent activation energies may be calculated as 26.4 and 14.3 kJ mol\"1 for methanoi and 2-propanol, respectively. These values appear to reflect the higher C H bond dissociation energy [17] of methanoi (393 kJ mol\"1) relative to 2-propanol (381 kJ mol\"1 for Me^C H), indicating an increased difficulty for methanoi dehydrogenation. We have also tried to dehydrogenate methanoi using Pt^Cl^dpm)^, Ir2(JU-S)(CO)2(dpm)2, Mo^CI^(dpm)^ or Mo2(OAc)4 as the catalyst. None of these complexes exhibited any thermal catalytic activity and photoirradia- tion was not so effective as in the cases of the rhodium and palladium com- plexes. It is of interest, however, that the iridium and platinum complexes showed an activity pattern which was respectively similar to the rhodium and palladium complexes. Thus Ir2(JU-S)(CO)2(dpm)2 exhibited photo- catalytic activity in the absence of acetone (0.05 mM solution of methanoi of total volume 500 ml; turnover frequency for H^ formation, 1.4 h\"1), the color of the solution changing from purple to brown-yellow upon illumina- tion.

The two molybdenum catalysts showed no appreciable photocatalytic activity towards H 3 formation. It appears that considerable scope for improving the catalyst for methanoi dehydrogenation in the liquid phase remains. References 1 H. B. Channan, y. Chem. Soc. B, (1970) 584. 2 A. Dobson and S. D.
