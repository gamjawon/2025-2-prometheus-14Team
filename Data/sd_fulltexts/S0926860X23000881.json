Si/Al ratio of ZSM-5 affecting Pt/ZSM-5 catalyst water-tolerance has been investigated for propane oxidation. Under wet condition (5 % H2O), it is found that Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyst contains both irreversible and reversible deactivation Pt active sites; Pt/ZSM-5 (130) and Pt/ZSM-5 (500) catalysts have only reversible deactivation Pt active sites; all the Pt active sites in the Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalyst are water tolerant. It is further found that the Si/Al ratio of ZSM-5 determines the geometrical and electronic states of Pt particles, and amount of surface acid sites on catalysts, thereby affecting the water tolerance of Pt/ZSM-5 catalyst. Low Si/Al ratio of ZSM-5 benefits to anchor the Pt species and form small Pt particles, but Pt particle with small size and more oxidized state Pt species (Ptδ+) on Pt/ZSM-5 (18) is easily poisoned by H2O. More Pt0 species generating on large Pt particle during propane oxidation reaction and low surface acid sites on Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalyst are responsible for its high water tolerance.

Efficient strategies regarding VOCs abatement are very essential for meeting the demand of the increasingly stringent environmental legislation. Among the available strategies, catalytic combustion is widely regarded as one of the most effective methods for VOCs abatement, especially for the low concentration or hazardous VOCs [4–7]. For the catalytic combustion technologies, the performance of catalyst plays critical roles on determining the efficiency of VOCs abatement. Numerous noble metal (Pt, Pd, Ru) [8–13] and non-noble metal (Cu, Mn, Co) [14–19] catalysts have been reported for catalyzing VOCs oxidation. Noble metal catalysts are greatly appealing in the field of VOCs catalytic oxidation owing to their high activity and thermal stability. For instance, platinum based catalysts often exhibit better performance for long chain alkanes oxidation while palladium based catalysts are more suitable for methane catalytic oxidation [20–23]. As the representative stable VOCs and commonly used fuel, propane has been widely employed as model reactant to evaluate oxidation activity of catalysts, and the platinum based catalysts usually show the excellent performance for propane oxidation [24–26]. In addition to the noble metal active components, the supports also significantly affect the catalytic activity of catalysts. Many kinds of metal oxides supports (CeO2, ZrO2, Nb2O5, etc.) and zeolites (ZSM-5, Y, SSZ-13, etc.) have been employed to support platinum catalysts for VOCs oxidation [8,27–31]. It is commonly recognized that the ZSM-5 zeolite with abundant moderate strong and strong acid sites, which are beneficial for catalyzing propane oxidation. On one hand, the acid sites promote the PtOx species to be easily reduced to metallic Pt0 species which are the active sites for propane oxidation [32]; on the other hand, the acid sites also facilitate the propane activation [33], thus enhancing the propane oxidation reaction rate. Besides, the Si/Al ratio of ZSM-5 zeolite also greatly affects the performance of platinum catalysts for propane oxidation activity. Park et al. found that the size of Pt species varied with the different Si/Al ratio of ZSM-5 zeolite, and Pt/HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 150) having smallest Pt particles and large external surface area showed the highest specific reaction rate for propane combustion [29]. Additionally, Zhu et al. claimed that addition of tungsten could further improve the catalytic activity of Pt/ZSM-5 catalyst for propane combustion owing to generation of more metallic platinum species [30]. It was also reported that the Si/Al ratio of ZSM-5 zeolite would affect the water-resistance of noble metal catalyst due to ZSM-5 with higher Si/Al ratio showing good hydrophobicity [33]. Besides the high oxidation activity, the robust stability of catalyst also arouses attractive interests. It is particularly true for the catalysts employed in the harshly industrial applied conditions, such as containing much water steam [34]. Water steam is one of the greatest threats to the platinum based catalyst and often lead to the serious deactivation of catalyst for catalytic oxidation reaction, thus more and more efforts have been devoted to the development of water tolerant platinum based catalysts for catalytic combustion. Yang et al. argued that Brønsted acid sites helped reduce water coverage on the Pt surface through a spillover-like mechanism, and more available sites could be used for propane adsorption and activation, thus enhancing reaction rates in propane combustion [35]. Huang et al. claimed that catalytic activity of palladium catalyst could be effectively kept at high level for methane combustion through in situ water sorption by water sorbents [36]. However, to the best of our knowledge, the reason why catalysts, such as platinum based catalyst, suffer the serious deactivation caused by water steam in the propane combustion reaction has not yet been fully revealed. The mechanistic investigation on the deactivation of platinum based catalyst under water steam is very meaningful but still lacking. Herein, we designed a series of Pt/ZSM-5 catalysts with different Si/Al ratios for propane combustion under dry or wet (5 % H2O) conditions, the influence of Si/Al ratio of ZSM-5 on the states of Pt active sites (e.g., particle size, surface chemical valance) and the water tolerance of Pt/ZSM-5 catalysts were investigated in detail. It is found that the Si/Al ratio of ZSM-5 significantly affects the geometrical and electronic properties of Pt particles, and surface property of catalysts, thereby leading to the different catalytic behaviors of Pt/ZSM-5 catalysts toward water tolerance. And the water-tolerant Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalyst has been successfully prepared for propane combustion owing to the low amount of acid sites and large size of Pt particle. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Chemicals and reagents Commercial ZSM-5 supports with different Si/Al ratio (SiO2/Al2O3 = 18, 130, 500 and 1200) were bought from Shandong Dengzhuo Chemical Co., Ltd. China. And Pt(NO3)2 solution was purchased from Shanghai Tuosi Chemical Co., Ltd. China. 2.2 Preparation of Pt/ZSM-5 catalyst A series of Pt/ZSM-5 catalysts with different Si/Al ratio and 1 wt% Pt in this work were prepared by the excess wetness impregnation method. In typical, 1 g of ZSM-5 support was dispersed into deionized water (5 mL), then Pt(NO3)2 solution (5 mL, 2 mg mL−1) was dropped under continuous stirring for 1.5 h at room temperature. Afterwards, the mixture was dried on a water bath at 90 °C. The obtained yellow solid was kept in an oven at 120 °C for 12 h and calcined at 500 °C for 3 h. Lastly, the gray solid catalyst was obtained and denoted to Pt/ZSM-5 (x), x represents the Si/Al ratio of ZSM-5. The Pt/ZSM-5 (18)-L catalyst with larger Pt size were prepared by pre-reducing Pt(NO3)2 with ethanol. Typically, the Pt(NO3)2 solution (5 mL, 2 mg mL−1) was mixed with ethanol (15 mL) under stirring at 80 °C for 0.5 h, then ZSM-5 (18) was added into the mixture. The gray solid was obtained by evaporating the mixture at 90 °C. Then, the gray solid was dried at 120 °C for 12 h and calcined at 500 °C for 3 h, and the Pt/ZSM-5 (18)-L catalyst was obtained. The Pt/ZSM-5 (1200)-S catalyst with smaller Pt size was prepared by decreasing the calcination temperature at 300 °C instead of 500 °C, other procedures are same to preparation of the Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalyst. 2.3 Characterization of catalyst N2 adsorption measurements of Pt/ZSM-5 catalysts were performed at 77 K on a BK200C system volumetric adsorption analyzer (Beijing Jingwei Gaobo Sci.-Tech. Ltd, Beijing, China). Prior to the sorption measurements, the catalysts were degassed at 120 °C for 12 h. The Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) surface area was obtained from the adsorption data at a relative pressure (P/P0) in the range of 0.05–0.35. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of catalysts were recorded using a Bruker D8 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation with a scan speed of 12° min−1 from 2θ of 10–90 °, operating at 40 kV and 40 mA. Field emission scanning transmission electron microscope (FE-STEM) images of the catalysts were obtained on a JEOL-2100 F microscope operated at 200 kV. The actual Si/Al ratio in the catalyst was determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis on a Shimadzu XRF-1800 spectrometer operated at 70 mA and 40 kV, the catalysts were dried in a oven at 120 °C for 12 h before the test. To measure the Pt dispersion of catalyst, the CO chemisorption test was conducted on the BELCAT II analyzer at 30 °C. Prior to the test, the catalyst was pre-treated in a high purity O2 flow (30 mL min−1) at 300 °C for 1 h, followed by purging He flow at 300 °C for 1 h. Afterwards, the catalyst was reduced in a H2 flow (5%H2 + 95%He, 30 mL min−1) at 300 °C for another 1 h and then cooled down to 30 °C in a N2 flow (30 mL min−1). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded using an ESCALAB 250Xi instrument with Al Kα source (hv = 1484.6 eV) and the binding energy was calibrated by C1s (284.8 eV). H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and NH3-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) experiments were conducted on a lab-made tubular quartz reactor (i.d. = 6 mm) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). For the H2-TPR test, 35 mg of catalyst was put in the reactor and heated from 30 to 800 °C with a heating ramp of 20 °C min−1 (in a flow of 5 % H2 + 95 % N2, 30 mL min−1). The signal of gas was recorded using a TCD detector after the H2O elimination by solid KOH fixed in a quartz tube. Prior to the H2-TPR test, the catalyst was pre-treated in a N2 flow of 20 mL−1 at 300 °C for 0.5 h. Water and carbon dioxide adsorbed on the catalyst surface can be removed in this treatment. For the NH3-TPD test, 200 mg of catalyst was put in the reactor and pre-treated in a N2 flow (20 mL min−1) under 300 °C for 0.5 h, and cooled down to 50 °C. Then, high purity NH3 gas was flowed in the reactor (30 mL min−1) for 10 min, and N2 flow (20 mL min−1) was purged for 0.5 h to clean the gaseous or physically adsorbed NH3 on catalyst. Then, the catalysts were heated from 40° to 700°C in a high purity He flow (20 mL min−1) to desorb the chemically adsorbed NH3, then the NH3 signal was recorded by the TCD. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra (DRIFTS) of CO chemisorption on Pt/ZSM-5 catalysts were measured on a Nicolet iS50 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a MCT detector and a PIKE DRIFT accessory under dry or wet condition (5 % H2O). Prior to the test, a certain amount of catalyst was put into a cell and was pre-treated in a high purity O2 flow (30 mL min−1) at 300 °C for 1 h and then cooled down to 30 °C in a N2 flow (30 mL min−1). Subsequently, the sample was reduced in a high purity H2 flow (30 mL min−1) at 300 °C for another 1 h. After it was cooled down to 30 °C, a mixture of 5 % CO in He (30 mL min−1) was introduced for 30 min. After purge with N2 (30 mL min−1) for 1 h, the spectrum was recorded at 30 °C. Water vapor concentration was controlled by setting the temperature of water bottle at 33.4 °C in which CO mixed gas (5 % CO + 95 % Ar) went through. 2.4 Activity evaluation The activities of the catalysts for propane combustion were measured in a tubular quartz reactor (i.d. = 6 mm). Typically, 50 mg of Pt/ZSM-5 catalyst (60–80 mesh) diluted by 50 mg quartz sand was put in the reactor. For the dry condition, the reagent gas consisted of 0.2 vol% C3H8 + 2 vol% O2/N2 balanced was flowed to the catalyst bed with a flow of 66.6 mL min−1 (mass space velocity of 80000 mL g−1 h−1). For the wet condition, the mixture gas above went through a water bottle (water vapor partial pressure of 5.03 kPa) at 33.4 °C and was diluted by the 5 % H2O. The concentrations of propane in the inlet and outlet were detected by a gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-2014) equipped with a DB-Wax (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm) capillary column and FID detector. CO oxidation reaction was also conducted under a home-made tubular quartz reactor (i.d. = 6 mm) at atmospheric pressure. In typical, 50 mg Pt/ZSM-5 catalyst diluted by 50 mg quartz was loaded in the reactor and CO mixture gas (0.6 vol% CO + 0.6 vol% O2/N2 balanced) was flowed (66.6 mL min−1) with a mass space velocity of 80,000 mL g−1 h−1. For the wet condition, the mixture gas above went through a water bottle (water vapor partial pressure of 5.03 kPa) at 33.4 °C and was diluted by the 5 % H2O. The concentrations of CO in the inlet and outlet were also detected by a gas chromatography equipped with a TDX-01 (3 m × 4 mm) capillary column and TCD detector. Propane oxidation reaction kinetics for two representative Pt/ZSM-5 (18) and Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalysts were performed at differential reaction condition (with propane conversion below 15%), see Supporting information. The catalyst was diluted with quartz sand (with same size) to 100 mg, and it was aged under the same condition as in catalytic test. By adjusting the partial pressures of propane (0.202–0.808 kPa) and O2 (9.09–1.515 kPa) in the reaction gas, a series of reaction rates were obtained and related kinetic parameters were derived. The detailed data of Arrhenius plots are also given in Supporting information for calculating apparent activation energy (Ea). 3 Result and discussion 3.1 General characterization Table 1 summaries the physicochemical properties of Pt/ZSM-5 catalyst with different Si/Al ratio (18, 130, 500 and 1200). The actual Si/Al ratio and Pt content of Pt/ZSM-5 catalyst measured by XRF are close to the nominal value, and all the Pt/ZSM-5 catalysts have a high BET surface area owing to the porous structure of ZSM-5 support. However, CO chemisorption uptake of the Pt/ZSM-5 catalyst obviously decreases with the increase of Si/Al ratio, indicating the change of Pt dispersion in Pt/ZSM-5 catalyst with different Si/Al ratio. Among them, the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyst shows the highest Pt dispersion of 32.8%, whereas only 7.5 % Pt dispersion for the Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalyst. According to the CO chemisorption uptake, mean sizes of Pt particles in Pt/ZSM-5 catalysts are also determined as shown in Table 1. Pt particles size remarkably increases from 3.4 to 15.1 nm with the Si/Al ratio increase from 18 to 1200. The Pt particle size determined by CO chemisorption is much larger than the zeolite channel size, especially for those on ZSM-5 with high Si/Al ratio, indicating most Pt species is located on ZSM-5 surface rather than confined in the zeolite channel. This inference can be confirmed by the STEM images ( Fig. 1a-d). Furthermore, particle size statistics method was used to analyze the Pt particles size from the STEM images. It can be seen that the mean size of Pt particles obtained by particle size statistics is close to that measured by CO chemical adsorption. The external surface area of Pt/ZSM-5 catalyst increases with the increasing Si/Al ratio, which is consistent with previous work [29], whereas the Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalyst with highest external surface area shows the lowest Pt dispersion. Such findings confirm that the size of Pt particles loaded on ZSM-5 support through the same impregnation method indeed changes with the Si/Al ratio of ZSM-5 which may be ascribed to the change of surface acid sites amount. In order to change the size of Pt particle on ZSM-5 (18), the Pt/ZSM-5 (18)-L catalyst was prepared by pre-reduction of Pt(NO3)2 using ethanol as reducing agent, other procedures were same to the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyst (As seen in experimental section). The Pt/ZSM-5 (18)-L catalyst shows a larger size of Pt particles (ca. 10.8 nm) compared to the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyst (ca. 3.4 nm). Also, the Pt/ZSM-5 (1200)-S catalyst calcined at 300 °C exhibits a smaller Pt particles (ca. 5.7 nm) compared to the Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalyst (ca. 15.1 nm). These results suggest the Pt particles loaded on the ZSM-5 surface can also be tuned by changing the preparation method. H2-TPR tests are conducted to understand the reducibility of PtOx species in the Pt/ZSM-5 catalysts (Fig. 1e). For the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyst, there are multi-peaks mainly centered at 110 and 165 °C in the H2-TPR profile, which are attributed to the reduction of PtOx species [37,38]. With the decrease of Si/Al ratio, these reduction peaks of the Pt/ZSM-5 catalysts gradually shift to higher temperature. This result may be attributed to that PtOx species strongly interact with the surface of ZSM-5 containing low Si/Al. Similar results are also observed on the Pt/ZSM-5 [30], Pt/USY [31]. The NH3-TPD profiles have also been conducted to investigate the surface acidity of the Pt/ZSM-5 catalysts (Fig. 1f). For the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyst, remarkable NH3 desorption peaks centered at 150 (α), 310 (β) and 540 °C (γ) are assigned to the NH3 desorption from weak, moderate strong and strong acid sites, respectively [20]. NH3 desorption peak β only appearing in the TPD profile of Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyst can be assigned to the moderate strong Lewis acid sites from Al ions. With the increase of Si/Al ratio, the intensity of NH3 desorption peaks remarkably decreases for the Pt/ZSM-5 catalysts, indicating ZSM-5 with higher Si/Al ratio having fewer acid sites. It is commonly recognized that the increasing Si/Al ratio would also enhance the acidity strength of acid sites, but it is very difficult to evaluate the increase of acidity strength due to the inapparent intensity assigned to the strong acid sites on Pt/ZSM-5 with high Si/Al ratio. In particular, it seems to that the Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalyst only contains weak acid sites compared to others because of the lack of strong acid sites [15,29]. 3.2 Catalytic performance Fig. 2a-c shows the light-off curves and turn over frequency of Pt sites (TOFPt) for propane oxidation over the Pt/ZSM-5 catalysts under dry or wet (5 % H2O) conditions. For the dry condition, the catalytic activities of Pt/ZSM-5 catalysts decrease with the increasing Si/Al ratio of ZSM-5, and the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyst exhibits the highest catalytic activity (Fig. 2a). Compared to the dry condition, there is a very different tendency of the catalytic activities related to Si/Al ratios under wet condition (5 % H2O) (Fig. 2b). The Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyst shows the lowest catalytic activity under wet condition (5 % H2O), which is much lower than the Pt/ZSM-5 (500) or Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalyst (Fig. 2b). It is also found from the light-off curves that only the Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalyst could remain the comparable catalytic activity under wet condition (5 % H2O) compared to dry condition. It can be seen that the TOFPt of the Pt/ZSM-5 catalyst firstly increases and then decreases with the increase of Si/Al ratio for the dry condition, and the Pt/ZSM-5 (500) catalyst shows the highest TOFPt of 0.057 s−1 among them (Fig. 2c, Table S1). For the wet condition (5 % H2O), only the Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalyst remain the comparable TOFPt of 0.032 s−1 to that under dry condition, whereas the TOFPt of Pt/ZSM-5 catalysts with other Si/Al ratios obviously decrease in different degree compared to the dry condition. The above results suggest that the Si/Al ratio of ZSM-5 significantly affects the catalytic activity and water tolerance of Pt/ZSM-5 catalyst for propane oxidation. To more directly observe the deactivation from dry to wet (5 % H2O) condition, the catalytic behaviors of these Pt/ZSM-5 catalysts for propane oxidation are also evaluated under staged reaction conditions (0.2 % C3H8 + 2 % O2 /N2 balanced; 0.2 % C3H8 + 2 % O2 + 5 % H2O/N2 balanced) as shown in Fig. 2d-f, and each stage is remained for one hour. The Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyst suffers a irreversible deactivation at initial stage (Fig. 2d), suggesting there are Pt active sites in the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyst irreversibly poisoned by water steam. After several cycles, the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyst shows a reversible deactivation, indicating that partial Pt active sites in the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) are reversibly poisoned by water steam. For the Pt/ZSM-5 (130) catalyst, the reversible deactivation is observed in all the measured time range (Fig. 2e), suggesting most Pt active sites in the Pt/ZSM-5 (130) catalyst are reversibly poisoned by water steam. The Pt/ZSM-5 (500) catalyst not only shows the reversible deactivation but also the lower degree of deactivation compared to the Pt/ZSM-5 (130) catalyst, indicating the higher water tolerance of Pt active sites in the Pt/ZSM-5 (500) catalyst. Interestingly, the Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalyst shows a very stable activity during the staged reaction condition, such finding strongly confirm that all the Pt active sites in the Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalyst are water tolerant. The results above suggest the water tolerance of Pt/ZSM-5 catalyst is significantly affected by the Si/Al ratio of ZSM-5. 3.3 Effects of Pt species states on water tolerance Catalytic activity of platinum based catalyst is often determined by the geometrical and electronic states (e. g., particle size, surface chemical valance) of Pt particles. Understanding the chemical states of Pt particles thoroughly is therefore essential to reveal their catalytic behaviors. Pt dispersion of Pt/ZSM-5 catalyst decreases with the increase of Si/Al ratio in ZSM-5, as evidenced by the CO chemisorption uptake and STEM images (Table 1, Fig. 1a-d). The effect of the surface area of ZSM-5 supports on Pt dispersion can be excluded because of all these ZSM-5 zeolites having a high surface area (Table 1). Thus, it is noteworthy to discuss the effect from surface property such as acidity because there are abundant Brønsted acid sites and Lewis acid sites in the ZSM-5 zeolites [39]. Dai et al. suggested the Lewis acid sites, especially for the unsaturated Al3+ species, in the ZSM-5 efficiently anchored the noble metal Pd specie and prevented it to agglomerate [33]. Whereas Treesukol et al. argued that Brønsted acid sites in ZSM-5 zeolites could stabilize Pt species, thus preventing their agglomeration to form larger Pt particles [40]. Therefore, acid sites play important roles on modulating Pt dispersion. As shown in the NH3-TPD (Fig. 1f), the amount of acid sites in Pt/ZSM-5 catalyst remarkably decreases with the increase of Si/Al ratio. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the decreased amount of acid sites in ZSM-5 zeolites with higher Si/Al ratio is responsible for their lower Pt dispersion, namely larger size of Pt particle. In order to confirm the size effect of Pt particles on the water tolerance, the Pt/ZSM-5 (18)-L catalyst with larger size of Pt particles and the Pt/ZSM-5 (1200)-S catalyst with smaller size of Pt particles were also employed for propane oxidation under the staged reaction condition as shown in Fig. 3a-b. It is found that the Pt/ZSM-5 (18)-L catalyst obviously shows a higher water tolerance compared to the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyst, and the water tolerance of the Pt/ZSM-5 (1200)-S catalyst decreases in comparison with the Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalyst. Combined with reaction activities of Pt/ZSM-5 catalysts (Fig. 2), it can be confirmed that Pt particles with relatively large size are beneficial for the improving the water tolerance of catalyst. The XPS spectra of fresh and spent Pt/ZSM-5 catalysts have been conducted to analyze chemical valance of surface Pt species as shown in Fig. 3c-d. Pt 4d signal is used instead of Pt 4 f because of overlap by Al 2p. The components with binding energy at 333.1 and 333.9 eV are assigned to the Pt 4d 3/2 spectra of surface Pt0 and Pt2+ species, respectively [30,38]. For the fresh Pt/ZSM-5 catalysts, the ratio of surface Pt0 species in the Pt/ZSM-5 catalysts gradually decreases with the increase of Si/Al ratio. Numerous works demonstrated that moderate strong and strong acid sites could promote the reduction of PtOx species to metallic Pt [20,22,25,30], thus, the fresh Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyst containing the most moderate strong and strong acid sites shows the highest ratio of surface Pt0. After propane oxidation under wet condition (5 % H2O), the spent Pt/ZSM-5 (18) and Pt/ZSM-5 (130) catalysts show the decreased ratios of surface Pt0 species compared to the fresh ones, whereas the spent Pt/ZSM-5 (500) catalyst nearly remains the ratio of surface Pt0 species compared to the fresh one, only the spent Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalyst shows a increased ratio of surface Pt0 species compared to the fresh one. Our previous works found that the ratio of Pt0/(Pt0 + Pt2+) plays crucial roles on the propane oxidation, the Pt0 species are beneficial for the C-H bonds activation while Ptn+ species promote the subsequent oxidation process [41]; and the formation of Pt0 species from PtOx during the induction period of propane oxidation would significantly accelerate the reaction [24,42]. Thus, the increased ratio of surface Pt0 of the Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalyst should be one of the important reasons for its good reactivity in light-off curve and high intrinsic activity (TOFPt) of the active sties under wet condition (Fig. 2b-c). The generation of Pt0 species is attributed to the reduction of PtOx during propane oxidation occurring on PtOx surface. Thus, the decreased surface Pt0 species observed on the spent Pt/ZSM-5 (18) and Pt/ZSM-5 (130) catalysts indicates their PtOx species are difficult to be reduced during propane oxidation with water steam. 3.3.1 Effects of surface acid sites on water tolerance Surface acid sites of ZSM-5 support also have great effect on the water tolerance performance of the Pt/ZSM-5 catalysts. For instance, the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) and Pt/ZSM-5 (1200)-S catalysts have the comparable size of Pt particles, the Pt/ZSM-5 (1200)-S catalyst with fewer acid sites shows the higher water tolerance; the Pt/ZSM-5 (18)-L and Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalysts also possess the close size of Pt particles, the Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalyst exhibits the much higher stability against the water steam. Thus, it can be inferred that the high amount of acid sites in the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyst should be one of the reasons for its inferior water tolerance, even though the acid sites are commonly regarded as positively active sites for propane activation under dry condition [20,23,25], and the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyst indeed shows the highest activity for propane oxidation under dry condition (Fig. 2a). Under wet condition, the water molecules may be easily adsorbed by the hydrophilic acid sites and then transferred to the small Pt particles, resulting in the Pt active sites being inaccessible to propane and oxygen molecules. Therefore, hydrophobicity of ZSM-5 (1200) support with high Si/Al ratio is also one of the important reasons for the high water tolerance. And previous works also discussed the critical role of hydrophobic support on improving water tolerance of VOCs oxidation catalysts [43,44]. 3.3.2 Water steam covering Pt active sites In order to know the different behaviors of Pt active sites accessible to the reactant molecules under dry and wet conditions, CO is used as the probe molecule to perform the DRIFTS spectra instead of the propane owing to propane weak adsorption on Pt active sites [45]. Fig. 3e shows the CO-DRIFTS spectra of the Pt/ZSM-5 catalysts recorded under dry or wet (5% H2O) conditions. The red and green profiles represent the CO-DRIFTS spectra obtained on dry and wet (5 % H2O) condition, respectively. For the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyst, the peak centered at 2089 cm−1 is assigned to CO adsorption on the metallic state of Pt species with surface partially oxidized (Ptδ+), while the peak centered at 2069 cm−1 corresponds to CO adsorption on completely reduced Pt specie (Pt0) [27,42,46,47]. Compared to dry condition, the intensity of these two peaks is dramatically weakened for the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyst under wet condition (5 % H2O), suggesting the decreased of Pt active sites accessible to CO caused by the coverage of H2O. The further decrease of the peak centered at 2090 cm−1 implies the Ptδ+ species is more sensitive to H2O molecule compared to Pt0 species. Ratio of total absorbance peak area of wet/dry is only 0.58 for the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyst (Fig. 3e). This result confirms the serious decrease of Pt active sites accessible to CO in the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyst under wet condition, accounting for remarkable deactivation for propane oxidation under wet condition (Fig. 2). Noticeably, the ratio of total absorbance peak area of wet/dry is increased with the increase of Si/Al ratio, indicating the improved water tolerance of Pt active sites on the ZSM-5 support with high Si/Al ratio. The Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalyst shows the highest peak area ratio of 0.98, representing the highest water tolerance of Pt active sites. In addition, the peaks slightly shift to higher wavenumber when the Si/Al ratio of ZSM-5 is increased from 18 to 1200, representing the decreased electron cloud density of metallic state of Pt species with increasing Si/Al ratio of the ZSM-5. Commonly, the abundant moderate strong and strong acid sites in ZSM-5 with low Si/Al ratio are believed to be advantageous in PtOx reduction, thereby resulting in the higher electron cloud density of metallic state of Pt species on ZSM-5 with lower Si/Al ratio. To further identify the accessibility change of Pt active sites to reactant molecules, the model reaction of CO oxidation has been evaluated for two representative Pt/ZSM-5 (18) and Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalysts under staged reaction conditions (Fig. 3f). Serious and irreversible deactivation also takes place for the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyzing CO oxidation at initial stage, further confirming some Pt active sites in the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyst are irreversibly poisoned by water steam. After several cycles, whereas the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyst could remain the catalytic activity for CO oxidation, which is slightly different from it catalyzing propane oxidation (Fig. 2d). This result may be ascribed to the strong adsorption of CO on the Pt active sites compared to propane, thus other partial active sites could offer relatively high water tolerance for CO oxidation compared to propane oxidation. For the Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalyst, the reactivity still remains high water tolerance for CO oxidation during the staged reaction condition, further confirming all the Pt active sites on Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) are water tolerant and accessible for reactant molecule under wet condition. 3.3.3 Kinetic result Fig. 4 and Table 2 shows the kinetics results to investigate the catalytic behaviors of two representative Pt/ZSM-5 (18) and Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalysts for propane oxidation under dry and wet (5% H2O) conditions in detail. The data obtained from dry and wet (5 % H2O) reaction conditions are shown in Fig. 4a-c and d-f, respectively. For the dry condition, the reaction rates of both the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) and Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalysts increase with the increase of propane or oxygen partial pressure. And the derived power law rate expressions are r = 3.0 × 10−6 [C3H8]0.87 [O2]0.19 for the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyst, and r = 1.1 × 10−6 [C3H8]0.96 [O2]0.48 for the Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalyst, and the related kinetic parameters are summarized in Table 2. Much higher apparent rate constant k obtained on the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyst represents its better catalytic activity for propane oxidation compared to the Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalyst under dry condition. This observation is consistent with apparent reactivity in the light-off curves (Fig. 2a). The apparent activation energy (Ea) of the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyst (Ea = 53.9 kJ mol−1) is much lower than that of the Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalyst (Ea = 71.4 kJ mol−1). This result is attributed to that more Pt active sites exposed on the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyst, even though the Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalyst has higher TOFPt. For the wet condition (5 % H2O), the reaction rates of the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) and Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalysts still increase with the increase of propane or oxygen partial pressure. The corresponding derived power law rate expressions are r = 0.90 × 10−6 [C3H8]0.88 [O2]0.31 and r = 1.2 × 10−6 [C3H8]0.92 [O2]0.45 for the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) and Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalyst under wet condition, respectively. But the Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalyst shows a higher apparent rate constant k than the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyst, which is very different from the dry reaction condition. Noticeably, the reaction order of propane hardly changes from dry to wet condition for both the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) and the Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalysts, whereas the reaction order of oxygen significantly increased for the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyst from dry to wet condition. Our previous work found that gaseous oxygen is adsorbed and activated on the Pt active sites loaded on the non-CeO2 support [28]. Thus, the increased reaction order of oxygen for the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyst represents the weakened oxygen adsorption on the Pt active sites under wet condition, ascribed to the Pt active sites poisoned by water steam. However, the reaction order of oxygen remains for the Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalyst under wet condition, indicating the higher water tolerance of its Pt active sites. And the Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalyst also has the lower Ea of 69.9 kJ mol−1, compared to 127.1 kJ mol−1 of Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyst under wet reaction condition. These above results suggest large amount of Pt active sites are seriously covered and poisoned by water molecules for the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyst, which are also evidenced by CO-DRIFTS spectra and CO oxidation reaction (Fig. 3e-f), resulting in the remarkable deactivation under wet condition. Whereas the high water tolerance of the Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalyst for propane oxidation should be attributed to the Pt active sites being uncovered by water molecules and accessible for reactant molecules. Scheme 1 simply describes the different catalytic behaviors of the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) and Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalysts for catalyzing propane oxidation from dry to wet condition. For the dry condition, the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyst shows lower activation energy, namely faster reaction rate, for propane oxidation owing to the high Pt dispersion and promotion of acid sites on propane activation. However, for the wet condition, H2O molecule absorbed in acid site prefers to transfer to adjacent small Pt particle, thus the high amount of acid sites in Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyst lead to the serious deactivation of catalyst caused by the H2O coverage on Pt particle. Additionally, the inhibited propane oxidation on the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyst under wet condition is responsible for its decreased ratio of surface Pt0 species after reaction. For the Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalyst, the low amount of acid sites for H2O adsorption and larger size of Pt particles result in nearly no water coverage on Pt particles and thus excellent water tolerance of catalyst. The facilitated propane oxidation on catalyst surface lead to the increased ratio of surface Pt0 species of the Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalyst after reaction. Thus, the different behaviors of the Pt/ZSM-5 (18) and Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalysts toward water tolerance can be understood. 4 Conclusion In summary, we prepared a series of Pt/ZSM-5 catalysts with different Si/Al ratio (18, 130, 500 and 1200) for propane catalytic combustion under dry and wet (5 % H2O) conditions. In particular, the critical factors on the deactivation of Pt/ZSM-5 catalysts caused by water steam have been clearly clarified. Higher amount of acid sites in the ZSM-5 with lower Si/Al ratio is beneficial for obtaining smaller Pt particles and promoting propane oxidation under dry condition. Whereas, more acid sites is disadvantageous in resisting water steam for Pt/ZSM-5 catalysts. Additionally, small size Pt particles and partially oxidized Pt specie (Ptδ+) in Pt/ZSM-5 catalyst with low Si/Al ratio are easily to be covered by H2O which leads to these Pt active sites being inaccessible to reactant molecule and therefore the inferior water tolerance of catalyst. Among these Pt/ZSM-5 catalysts, the Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalyst exhibits the highest water tolerance for propane combustion owing to the largest size of Pt particles, most Pt0 species generating during reaction and lowest amount of acid sites.

        "dc:description": "Si/Al ratio of ZSM-5 affecting Pt/ZSM-5 catalyst water-tolerance has been investigated for propane oxidation. Under wet condition (5 % H2O), it is found that Pt/ZSM-5 (18) catalyst contains both irreversible and reversible deactivation Pt active sites; Pt/ZSM-5 (130) and Pt/ZSM-5 (500) catalysts have only reversible deactivation Pt active sites; all the Pt active sites in the Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalyst are water tolerant. It is further found that the Si/Al ratio of ZSM-5 determines the geometrical and electronic states of Pt particles, and amount of surface acid sites on catalysts, thereby affecting the water tolerance of Pt/ZSM-5 catalyst. Low Si/Al ratio of ZSM-5 benefits to anchor the Pt species and form small Pt particles, but Pt particle with small size and more oxidized state Pt species (Ptδ+) on Pt/ZSM-5 (18) is easily poisoned by H2O. More Pt0 species generating on large Pt particle during propane oxidation reaction and low surface acid sites on Pt/ZSM-5 (1200) catalyst are responsible for its high water tolerance.",
