Mercierlaan 92, B-3001 Heuerlee (Belgium) (Received March 23, 1992; accepted March 9, 1993 ) Abstract An attempt has been made to develop a quantitative comparison of the properties of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalyst systems. The bond formation, and its projected covalent character, of a carbenium ion with the surface of zeolites and with water molecules in solution served as a basis to collect quantitative data. These data are the global electronegativity and hardness and the local softness (reactivity parameter of atoms-in-molecules) as these can be calculated for solids and molecules in the EEM formalism. A consistent model could be developed for a quantitative and qualitative comparison. It shows that generally, hydrated carbenium ions remain more ionic than those interacting with the surface of silicates or zeolites. Key words: acid catalyst; carbenium ions; electronegativity equalization; homogeneous catalysis; heterogeneous catalysis; sensitivity analysis Introduction A discussion of the mechanisms encountered in homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis faces the problem of quantitatively accounting for solvation effects. Putting these on the same \"scale\" is an even more formidable task. One of the routes most commonly proposed in acid catalysis of hydrocarbons involves the making and stabilization of a carbeniO ion. A study by Kazansky et al. [ 1-4 ] makes an attempt to address the interaction of aliphatic carbenium \"`Corresponding author. 0304-5102/93/$06.00 1993 - Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. All rights reserved. 136 V.B. Kazansky et al./J Mol. Catal. 83 (1993)135-143 ions with water and with zeolite surfaces. In this way, it was hoped to bridge the gap in understanding the processes in solution and at surfaces. It was concluded from quantum chemical calculations, that in zeolites [ 1,2 ] , these species are essentially covalent in nature in their ground state: one can hardly speak of carbenium \"ions\". They are better described as surface esters or polarized alkoxy groups. The formation of such groups is supported by recent NMR data [5,6]. On the other hand, these theoretical studies show that these groups become more ionic and in their geometry and charge distribution resemble the corresponding free carbenium ions if the carbon-oxygen bond is stretched or vibrationally excited. This indicates that the adsorbed carbenium ions are the transition states of corresponding acid catalyzed reactions rather than the actual existing active intermediates. Similarly [ 3 ] , non-empirical quantum chemical calculations were applied for analysis of the nature of methyl carbenium ions solvated by one or several water molecules. It was also concluded that the interaction with the first molecule converts a methyl cation into a methyl oxonium ion or a protonated methanol, where the alkyl group remains essentially covalent. With the subsequent hydration, the positive charge gradually becomes more delocalized and transferred towards the solvating water molecules. This makes the methyl group even more covalent, similar to the situation in methanol. The structure of a hydrated methyl carbenium ion corresponds, according to these calculations, to a cluster which essentially represents a hydroxonium ion solvated by two water molecules and one polarized molecule of methanol: ~CH3 O i H O H H H-O' `~O-H H H Since the proton affinity of free methanol (8.04 eV) is higher than that of water (7.52 eV) [ 7 ] , the positive charge is probably localized in this structure at the proton involved in hydrogen bonding with methanol. In this paper, a more quantitative comparison of the electronic state of carbenium ions adsorbed on the surface of oxide heterogeneous catalysts and those solvated by water will be made with the help of the electronegativity equalization method (EEM) and the sensitivity analysis [8,9] which was recently developed within this formalism. V B. Kazansky et al./J Mol. Catal. 83 (1993)135-143 137 EEM and sensitivity analysis The EEM formalism is a semi-empirical approach to density functional theory (DFT), allowing direct computation of the charge distribution and effective electronegativity of molecules and crystals. It has recently been expanded to make a full sensitivity analysis, by calculating the local and global hardness and softness parameters and various, related, sensitivity coefficients. Within the DFT approach, an understanding of chemical reactivity requires knowledge of electron density relaxation effects, i.e. the adaptation of the electronic charge distribution of a reactant to the perturbing electrostatic potential or charge transfer produced by the other reactant. The \"sensitivity\" is then defined as the response of the energy E of the system to a change in the total number of electrons N or the external potential v, i.e. as the derivative of E with respect to N or v. Various fundamental properties of a system can be defined in this way: the charge qa= (aE/ava), the average electronegativity X= - (aE/aN), the global hardness 2?1= (a ZE/aN 2) = - (aX/aN), the Fukui function fa= - (aqa/ aN) = (Wava), where the index \"a\" denotes an atom of the molecule or the solid. The electron density distribution function and the Fukui function are continuous local functions - their atomic equivalent, i.e. integrated over the atomic \"region\" are directly obtained by the EEM formalism and constitute a more transparent \"chemical\" property. These functions allow the chemical behavior of various systems to be analyzed. For instance, the electronegativity differences drive the electron transfer and determine the direction of electron flow. Chemical hardness is the resistance to electron displacements or fluctuations and thus also influences the degree of charge transfer. It is associated with polarazibility and is proportional to the energy gap between the frontier orbitals (HOMO-LUMO gap) [ 10 ] . The Fukui function is a local property measuring the charge shift on an atom upon changing the total number of electrons in the system. Electrodynamically it can be regarded as a charge capacitance, and in terms of MO theory, it is the electron density of the frontier orbitals [ 11 ] . Formally it is a relative measure (since it is normalized and integrates to one) of local softness. Absolute local softness, s, (comparable from molecule to molecule) can be obtained by dividing fa by the global hardness, tl, i.e. sa= ,,/?I. Using a spherical atom approach, the global effective electronegativity and hardness are calculated as: X=Xa=Xa +2?I$qa+k F, qb/Rab=Xb=... (1) 2r =2 rlafa+k E, fbfRab (2) where Xa and r a are the atom in the molecule electronegativity and hardness respectively; qa and fa denote the charge and the Fukui function of an atom; k is a conversion factor and R.b the interatomic distance between atoms a and b. 138 V.B. Kazansky et al./J Mol. Catal. 83 (1993)135-143 To be able to discuss the results for aluminum and phosphorous containing systems below, we shall use a self-consistent parameter set which has been determined in reference 13 using STO-3G ab initio charges obtained by a Mulliken population analysis. Note that in refs. 8, 9 and 12 different parametrisations were used. Results and discussion Comparison of heterogeneous (silica) and homogeneous (water) systems in their interaction with carbenium ions The carbenium ions are known to be strong Lewis acids. Therefore, when they interact with the basic oxygen of water or with a surface oxygen of an oxide catalyst more or less covalent complexes are formed. This results in partial electron transfer from oxygen to the carbon atom of the corresponding carbocation and in a decrease of its positive charge: R++Base,R'I-a)+ (Base)\"+ According to Pearson [ 14 ] , the extent of such charge transfer can be estimated in a first approximation from the following expression: XR+ -Xs (3 ) dN-2(yIR++W) Note that we are using the molecular (global) electronegativities of both the molecules involved in the interaction and not the electronegativities and hardnesses of the directly interacting atoms only: all atoms in the molecule (or solid) are affected simultaneously, although the effect attenuates with increasing topological distance from the interaction center; this is a direct consequence of equation (1). (The individual atomic sensitivities can be estimated using the EEM formalism.) Equation (3) has a clear physical meaning: the difference in electronegativity of the corresponding carbenium ion and that of water or oxide drives the electron transfer, while the sum of their hardnesses acts as a resistance. Thus, the chemical bond of adsorbed carbenium ion with the surface oxygen atom or with that of a solvating water molecule will be more ionic, the smaller the electronegativity difference and the harder the solvent or the adsorbent. For the same carbenium ion, the properties of the solvent molecules or solid will be the dominating factor. To begin, let us compare the sensitivities of molecules and solids, as these are calculated by the EEM method and presented in Table 1. The first part represents global hardnesses, electronegativities and local softness on oxygen atoms for some silicates and hypothetical silica-like materials with open (zeolite-type) frameworks together with their variation in framework density d (number of T-atoms/1000 A3).

'Geometry of water and water dimer, see ref. 16. Geometry of ice II, see ref. 17. on Al- and P-containing silicates. Finally, some data for water, a cyclic water dimer and ice are presented. As noted earlier for solids [12,13], the framework density inversely correlates with the average electronegativity. The same holds for the global hardness, which is not surprising since the overall X and >I can be expressed as x= (I+ A) /2 and tj= (I-A) /2,1 being the ionization potential and A the (much smaller) electron affinity. The variation of the electronegativity and hardness of these systems can 140 V.B. Kazansky et al./J. Mol. Catal. 83 (1993)135-143 be understood by the stronger Madelung field of the denser crystal structures, which better stabilizes \"electron holes\" resulting from the removal of electrons from the crystal lattice. This lowers the electron work function (i.e. I for the solid) and therefore decreases the electronegativity of these materials. In accordance with this explanation, i.e. the decreasing influence of the Madelung term, the electronegativity is further increasing for open structures such as zeolites. Water as an isolated molecule without any Madelung field must conversely have the highest electronegativity. At the same time, one can expect the electronegativity of the water dimer to be lower than for the free molecule. This seems to be true for the geometryoptimized water dimer. However, ice does not follow the same trend. The data presented in this table are based on experimental geometries for ice II [ 17 ] . The interatomic distances and bond angles are quite different from the dimer. Comparison of a water molecule in ice with an isolated water molecule of the same geometry reveals little. The average electronegativity for the ice crystal is an average for two water molecules where 0.006 electrons have been transferred between them (about the same amount as found by Kollman and Allen [ 161 for the linear water dieter). The present data suggest that for molecular crystals, the properties of the individual molecules are only slightly perturbed when imbedded in a crystal (which is consistent with the common understanding! [18] ). The parallel increase in global hardness can be explained by similar arguments: rl will increase upon weakening of the interaction between the molecules or the atoms of the solid. From the standpoint of the solid state physics this means that the stronger interaction in the denser systems makes the energy bands broader and the band gap narrower. Thus the free molecule represents the extreme case, where the energy levels are discrete and the HOMOLUMOseparation is the largest. Using the EEM sensitivity analysis results, we are now in a position to quantitatively compare the properties of solids and solvents. Especially for the interaction of a carbenium ion with such molecules or solids, the application of equation (3), immediately suggests that there is no reason for the existence at the surface of silicates of more ionic adsorbed species than in water solutions. In other words, the aliphatic carbenium ions, if formed by protonation of adsorbed olefins, or by any other mechanism, should easily transform into covalent surface alkoxides similar to oxonium species in water solutions. Influence of Al and P framework substitution The silica polymorphs are certainly only model systems. It is therefore reasonable to investigate whether the above conclusions are also valid for zeolites and alumino-phosphate molecular sieves. A comparison of the data for the silica polymorphs with those of the alumino-silicate zeolites with the same structure type shows that incorporation of A1 in the framework definitely decreases the electronegativity (which is con- V.B. Kazansky et al./J Mol. Catal. 83 (1993)135-143 141 sistent with expectation) and increases the global hardness. For instance, for MOR x is decreasing from 3.45 to 3.38, for MFI from 3.50 to 3.39 and from 3.99 to 3.41 for FAU-type structures. Unfortunately, drawing general conclusions regarding the influence of the A1 content cannot be done since these data do not only reflect the difference in structure type, but also a difference in Si/Al ratio (and ordering scheme). The corresponding hardness increase is 3.14 to 3.21 (MOR), 3.04 to 3.08 (MFI) and 5.20 to 5.35 (FAU). For all these structures however, all values for x and rI remain considerably below those of the water molecules. The above conclusion about the more ionic nature of solvated carbenium ions in water vs. the nature of the interaction with the oxygens in silicates remains valid. The FAU-type structures with a 1:1 Al/Si and Al/P framework composition are among the hardest in this series, which is the result of the combined effect of low framework density and framework composition. Parameters influencing the local softness While the electronegativities in a molecule or solid are equalized, it is allowed to use the global electronegativity differences, but it is certainly not sufficient to use the global hardnesses: local softness 88 is a well-defined property which will directly influence the (local) chemical bond. All these (global and local) sensitivities can easily be calculated on the atom in the molecule level in the EEM formalism. For the \"dense\" silica polymorphs, i.e. stishovite, quartz, crystobalite and tridymite, there is a distinct decrease in local softness with decreasing framework density. However, the open zeolite structures are no longer homogeneous in their framework atom environment. Although the general trend (as reflected by the global hardness increase) still holds, there exists a marked difference in local density for the individual atoms. The atoms in the denser parts of the structure now have less softness than those in the open parts of the framework (this has been discussed extensively before [9] ). The softest oxygens given in Table 1 are therefore those which are at the most accessible sites, i.e. at the surface of the channels and cages. These oxygens will be the most reactive in bond formation (with the carbenium ions). From the data, we can safely say that in the most open frameworks all other parameters being equal, the covalent character of the carbenium ion-surface-oxygen bonds will be the lowest (although still much more covalent than in water). Conclusion The results of this paper show that generally hydrated carbenium ions in water solution remain more ionic than those adsorbed on the surface of silicates, zeolites or alumino-phosphates. Thus the conclusion about the exceptional properties of zeolites as solid electrolytes should be considered with great 142 V.B. Kazansky et al./J Mol. Catal. 83 (1993)135-143 care. This is consistent with previous studies [ 1-4 ] where adsorbed carbenium ions are treated merely as transition states generated from more covalent (alkoxy) surface intermediates. In addition, the EEM formalism enables a more general common measure for the characterization of homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. One clear line however follows the classification of solids, and the band properties that go along with these solids. After all, the Fermi level agrees with the global average electronegativity and the valence-conduction band gap with the global hardness. This opens new perspectives for direct measurements of these properties and for the discussion of the catalytic properties of homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts. It is worthwhile to refer to the work by Duffy [ 19 ] who used the charge transfer energy between valence and conduction band of metal oxides to establish an electronegativity scale of these atoms (optical electronegativity). The essence of the classification of solids which applies here is the \"size\" of the cluster in which electronegativity equalization is possible by charge transfer. This \"bog\" (with reference to the freedom of movement of an electron in a bog) is restricted to the molecules in molecular solids and in solution. In these systems, electronegativity equalization (all molecules already have the same electronegativity in isolation!) is accomplished by small adjustments in geometry and bond polarization. The hardness of these molecules will directly be related to their size. In metals and covalent structures such as in diamond, this \"bog\" extends through the whole crystal. The band properties directly determine the reactivity. Silicates can also be classified with the covalent materials, but the larger the ionicity of the bonds, the smaller the \"bog\" will be (ultimately, for pure ionic solids the \"bog\" is the anion). In previous work [ 9 ] , the size of the \"bog\", i.e. the extent to which a local perturbation is felt through the framework is estimated to be approximately 1.4-1.8 nm in diameter. If we consider the \"box\" in silicates to consist primarily of an uninterrupted -Si04 moiety, we can understand more easily the results discussed above. We can indeed consider the termination of such a moiety by an A1 tetrahedron as a barrier which is much less \"permeable\" for electrons. This semipermeability will worsen when the T-O distance further increases (such as for the substitution of divalent cations). In AIP04 structures, the Al-O distance e.g. is larger than in aluminosilicates, such that the \"box\" there can easily be associated with the single P04 tetrahedron. An increased degree of substitution will necessarily result in an effective decrease of the \"box\", i.e. in an increase of the hardness, which is consistent with our data.

These data are the global electronegativity and hardness and the local softness (reactivity parameter of atoms-in-molecules) as these can be calculated for solids and molecules in the EEM formalism. A consistent model could be developed for a quantitative and qualitative comparison. It shows that generally, hydrated carbenium ions remain more ionic than those interacting with the surface of silicates or zeolites.
