Graphical abstract Novel benzodithiophene-linked COF-based metal-free catalyst shows high ORR activity. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) play a crucial role in metal-free electrocatalysts for promoting oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to their adjustable skeleton structure and catalytic activity. While it is true that numerous studies have explored COFs for ORR, the critical gap by providing a systematic framework for ligand-driven electronic state manipulation is essential for designing highly active COF-based ORR catalysts. Herein, a series of COF-based metal-free materials have been conceived and synthesized by linkage-engineered strategy with dicarboxaldehyde (BPC), bipyridine-dicarbaldehyde (BPA) and benzodithiophene (BDA) as electronic linkages. Consequently, by incorporating different linkages into COFs, the surface area, electronic state, hydrophobic properties and affinities towards intermediates are optimized. Notably, the benzodithiophene-linked COF (denoted as BDA-COF) has greater catalytic ability with a half-wave potential of 0.74 V vs. RHE and an onset potential of 0.86 V vs. RHE than dicarboxaldehyde (denoted as BPC-COF) and dicarbaldehyde (denoted as BPA-COF). Relevant characterizations, in situ techniques and theoretical calculations confirm that thiophene-S-based COF promotes the electronic migration and enhances the interaction with the intermediate. The result provides insight into for illustration of a high-performance COF-based electrocatalyst via a linkage-engineered approach. Keywords Linkage engineering Covalent organic frameworks Electronic state Oxygen reduction 1 Introduction The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) driven by an electrocatalyst with high activity has a key role in metal-air and fuel cells [1–3]. However, metal-based catalysts such as Pt or Co are usually used in ORR, which is faced with rigorous challenges of great cost, poor stability, and rarity [4]. It is urgent to develop novel electrocatalysts with high ORR performances to replace metal-based catalysts. Among the highly catalytic ability, the metal-free materials demonstrate substantial potential based on their low cost, prominently chemical stability, adjustable energy band structure and diversely structural designability [5–7]. In this process, the carbon-based material shows fascinating conductivity and catalytic activity. Nevertheless, the inherent deficiencies of poorly structural designability, sluggishly oxygen-diffused kinetics and weak adsorption of intermediates in carbon-based catalyst limit its further application [8–10]. In consequence, developing valuable metal-free electrocatalyst with definite structure models and plentifully active centers remain a huge challenge. Recently, organic porous materials have caused abundant attention in ORR due to their multielement composition, designability at the molecular level and precise atomic modification [11]. Among them, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have fully-designable structures, high crystallinity, easy chemical functionalization and wide selectivity for building blocks [12–16]. Particularly, long-range order, one-dimensional pore channels, tunable electronic state and plentifully active centers of COFs make them prospective electrocatalysts towards ORR [17–22]. Although some advances in COFs-based electrocatalysts in ORR have been obtained [23–37], the critical scientific issues need to be considered and studied: (1) the highly-ordered pores almost have not been prepared in reported COFs-based ORR catalyst, resulting in poorly O2 diffused kinetics; (2) no literature studies the relationships between various ligands (such as biphenyl, biphenyridine, benzodithiophene et. al.) and catalytic performance, which is still a barrier in the design of high-performance linkage-engineered COF-based catalysts; (3) the accurate controls of active center with different location and quantity remain challenging, which is not beneficial for understanding the connection of mechanism, structure and corresponding properties. Therefore, precisely controlled synthesis of various linkages located in COFs-based ORR catalysts with highly-ordered pore structures has a significant academic and industrial value. In this work, in order to study the structure–activity relationship between different linkage-engineering and their properties of COF-based ORR catalysts, we design and synthesize differently electronegative units of biphenyl-dicarboxaldehyde (BPC), [2,2′-bipyridine]-5,5′-dicarbaldehyde (BPA) and benzodithiophene (BDA) with pyrene linked COF materials. The 4,4′,4″,4″′-(1,3,6,8-tetrakis (4-aminophenyl) pyrene (Py) shows outstanding features of π-conjugated structure, rich-electron and high carrier migration [38]. The various linkages of BPC, BPA and BDA with C, N and S atom modification have disparately electronic acceptability (Fig. 1 a). The electrostatic potential (Fig. 1b) and charge density difference (Fig. 1c) of building units can accelerate electron transfer from Py to BDA. Moreover, from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of these units (Fig. 1d), the LUMO level of BDA is −3.818 eV, which is close to the HOMO level (−5.522 eV) of Py. Therefore, the electrons easily transfer from Py to BDA than BPC and BPA. To implement our viewpoint, the COFs (denoted as BPC-COF, BPA-COF and BDA-COF) are built by the above-mentioned organic units (Fig. 1e). Consequently, the electronic state, hydrophobic property and diffused kinetics are optimized to regulate the catalytic activity of COF materials. Moreover, the thiophene-S group has relative activation in organic photoelectric material [39]. The polarization intensity of the S atom of thiophene-S is markedly higher than N and C atoms, resulting in the formation of multiple S–S and S–C interactions [40,41]. Furthermore, the phenomenon of molecular orbital overlap in the thiophene-S group is easily generated to facilitate charge transfer and O2 diffusion and enhance conductivity and catalytic activity. Therefore, the thiophene-S modified BDA-COF (Fig. 1f) shows better ORR performances than BPC-COF and BPA-COF, which is a good guideline for designing high-performance ORR catalyst. 2 Experimental Synthesis of BDA-COF: A Pyrex tube was charged with Py (11.3 mg, 0.02 mmol) and BDA (9.8 mg, 0.04 mmol). Then, a mixed 1 mL solution of n-butanol/1,2-dichlorobenzene (1:1, v/v) was added to the tube. Subsequently, the tube was sonicated for 10.0 min, and acetic acid (0.1 mL, 6 M) was added to the mixture. The tube was frozen in a liquid N2 bath and sealed under vacuum. After sealing, the tube was placed in an oven at 120 °C for 3 d. After cooling at room temperature, the yielded solid was collected by filtering and washed with tetrahydrofuran several times. The obtained solid was immersed in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran for 24 h, and the solvent was replaced 6 times per day using fresh solvents. Finally, the active sample was dried at 100 °C for 12 h under vacuum to yield BDA-COF as orange powder. The synthetic method of BPC-COF and BPA-COF, and experiment are provided in the Supporting Informtion. 3 Results and discussion To realize various linkages in COF materials, we deliberately use organic monomers containing C, N and S elements, respectively. As shown in Scheme S1, the BPC-COF, BPA-COF and BDA-COF are built by condensation Py (as planar tetragonal linker), BPC, BPA and BDA (as linear linkers) [42]. We use powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) to evaluate the crystallinity of BPC-COF, BPA-COF and BDA-COF. The prominent peaks of BPC-COF, BPA-COF and BDA-COF can be observed at 2θ = 3.14°, 3.18° and 3.19° in Fig. 2 a–c, which are ascribed to (100) planes. Moreover, other unobvious peaks at 2θ = 6.28° and 9.51° for BPC-COF, at 2θ = 6.37° and 9.6° for BPA-COF [43], at 2θ = 6.34° and 9.61° for BDA-COF, correspond to the (200) and (300) planes. The BPC-COF, BDA-COF and BDA-COF have sharp peaks of (100) plane and other multiple reflections, indicating high crystallinity of these COFs. In addition, the full Pawley refined profiles match the experimental PXRD patterns with good agreement factors (a = 27.9, b = 28.7 Å, c = 3.8 Å, α = β = γ = 90°, R wp = 7.52% and R p = 6.52% for BPC-COF; a = 27.7, b = 28.5 Å, c = 3.7 Å, α = β = γ = 90°, R wp = 9.02% and R p = 6.19% for BPA-COF; a = 27.8, b = 27.9 Å, c = 3.8 Å, α = β = γ = 90°, R wp = 5.88% and R p = 4.52% for BDA-COF). We also study the alternative AB stacking with experimental results. The PXRD patterns of BPC-COF (Fig. S1), BPA-COF (Fig. S2), BDA-COF (Fig. S3) and calculated PXRD pattern based on the AA and AB stacking indicate that the structural model of these COFs is AA stacking, resulting in a quadrilateral pore of 2.2 nm (inset in Fig. 2a–c). Finally, the PXRD patterns of synthesized BPC-COF (Fig. S4), BPA-COF (Fig. S5), BDA-COF (Fig. S6) and starting materials prove high purity of phase and complete chemical transformation of these COFs. The pore size of BPC-COF, BPA-COF and BDA-COF are measured by Nitrogen adsorption–desorption analysis. As shown in Fig. 2d–f, these COFs display rapid adsorption at a pressure between P/P 0 = 0.05 and 0.2. The sorption curves of as-synthesized COFs are best described as a type IV, suggesting mesoporous materials with a distinct hysteresis loop indicating capillary condensation within the mesopores. In addition, the BET surface areas of 2561 m2·g−1 for BPC-COF, 2135 m2·g−1 for BPA-COF and 3016 m2·g−1 for BDA-COF are obtained from the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation according to nitrogen adsorption–desorption analysis. The large BET area is beneficial for O2 diffusion and adsorption of intermediates. The pore size of BPC-COF, BPA-COF and BDA-COF is calculated to be 2.1 nm (Fig. 2d–f, inset) according to non-local density functional theory. The pore size is in good line with the sorption type [44]. We further use transmission electron micrographs (TEM) to observe the pore shape and size. Fig. 2g–i show regular and apparent quadrilateral pores with 2.1 nm, which is in high accordance with the above discussions. Element mappings imply that C and N are uniformly distributed in the COF skeletons. The additional S element in BDA-COF demonstrates the successful modification of various linkages. Furthermore, the pore distribution in one direction is also observed in Fig. S7 for BPC-COF, Fig. S8 for BPA-COF and Fig. S9 for BDA-COF, confirming their well-ordered crystallinity. The regular and apparent pores engineering is achieved for the first time in COF-based ORR catalysts, which has important academic values for providing powerful evidence to study the diffused process of O2 molecular in highly-ordered pore structures. The chemical structure of prepared COFs is assessed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. An evident peak at 1620 cm−1 is observed in BPC-COF, BPA-COF and BDA-COF, indicating successful formation of C=N connections [44]. And the signal of CHO and NH2 groups are not observed in prepared COFs (Figs. S10–S12), suggesting the complete chemical conversion. Raman's results also prove the C=N in BPC-COF, BPA-COF and BDA-COF (Fig. S13). In addition, the S–C, C=N and C=C bonds are recognized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Fig. S14a–d), which is a coincidence with the structure of BPC-COF, BPA-COF and BDA-COF. The XPS spectra of BDA-COF show distinct peaks for C 1s, N 1s, and S 2p, which are consistent with the presence of the BDA unit and the imine linkage (Fig. S14a). Moreover, the N 1s show 398.7 eV for BPC-COF, 399.1 eV for BPA-COF, 398.6 eV for BDA-COF (Fig. S14c). Notably, the binding energy of C=N in BDA-COF is slightly lower than that BPC-COF and BPA-COF, suggesting electron enrichment around the sulfur atoms due to the electron-donating effect of the BDA unit. This electron enrichment facilitates electron migration and enhances the interaction with ORR intermediates, such as O2 and OOH*. Thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. S15) proves that the BPC-COF, BPA-COF and BDA-COF have high thermal stability. The microstructure of these COFs is evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. BPC-COF shows bar morphology with size of approximately 120 nm (Fig. S16). The BPA-COF shows cube morphology with size of approximately 250 nm (Fig. S17). Whereas the BDA-COF shows spherical morphology with size of approximately 300 nm (Fig. S18). The contact angle (Fig. S19) of thiophene-S modified BDA-COF presents hydrophobic properties than biphenyl-decorated BPC-COF and dipyridyl-decorated BPA-COF, which is beneficial for fast O2 diffusion to active center. Furthermore, the structural stability of BPC-COF, BPA-COF and BDA-COF is evaluated by immersing them in an aqueous KOH solution (0.1 M) for 7 days and storing in air for 1 year. After treatment, the PXRD patterns (Figs. S20–S22) and FT-IR patterns (Figs. S23–S25) are still well maintained with synthesized COFs, implying high structural stability. Therefore, the different ligands linked COF materials with various heteroatom doping can significantly affect the surface area, electronic state, hydrophobic properties and growth mode. In order to evaluate the electrocatalytic ORR performances of synthesized BPC-COF, BPA-COF and BDA-COF catalysts, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) tests are carried out in oxygen-saturated KOH electrolyte (0.1 M). Fig. 3 a and Figs. S26–S28 show the LSV curves of COFs catalysts that BDA-COF has a higher halfwave potential of 0.74 V vs. RHE than BPC-COF (0.66 V vs. RHE) and BPA-COF (0.68 V vs. RHE). Moreover, BDA-COF has a higher onset potential of 0.86 V than BPC-COF (0.79 V vs. RHE) and BPA-COF (0.82 V vs. RHE), implying thiophene-S linked COF has higher catalytic activity than the other two COFs. Fig. S29 shows the LSV curve of bare carbon nanotube, implying no influence for the catalytic activity after being mixed with COF. As shown in Table S1, to provide a more comprehensive context for our work, we have expanded the literature review section to include a detailed discussion of recent advances in metal-free COFs catalysts for ORR. Specifically, we have highlighted the contributions of Fang’s group [25,28], Zeng’s group [18,27], Xu’s group [22], Long’s group [24,45], and other leading researchers in the field. The expanded comparison and literature review clearly demonstrate that BDA-COF outperforms many state-of-the-art metal-free COFs and graphite carbon-based catalysts in terms of catalytic activity, stability, and structural design. The key advantages of BDA-COF include: (1) Hierarchical Pore Structure: The combination of micropores and mesopores in BDA-COF facilitates efficient oxygen diffusion and provides a high density of active sites, resulting in superior ORR activity. (2) High Specific Surface Area: With a specific surface area of 3,016 m2 g−1, BDA-COF offers more active sites than most reported COFs and carbon-based catalysts. (3) Exceptional Stability: BDA-COF maintains its structural integrity and catalytic performance over extended cycling, making it a promising candidate for practical applications. This discussion not only underscores the significance of our work but also positions BDA-COF as a next-generation catalyst with superior performance and practical application potential. Furthermore, the BDA-COF has the lowest Tafel slope (Fig. 3b) with 74 mV dec−1 than BPC-COF (85 mV dec−1) and BPA-COF (80 mV dec−1), implying BDA-COF has fast kinetic. The BDA-COF (3.9 mF cm−2) shows the largest electrochemical double-layer capacitance (C dl) than BPC-COF (1.8 mF cm−2) and BPA-COF (2.7 mF cm−2) in Fig. 3c and Table S2, suggesting BDA-COF catalyst has high electrochemically active surface areas (Figs. S30–S32). In addition, the ultra-high kinetic current density (Jk ) (Fig. 3d) at 0.7 V proves that BDA-COF (7.6 mA cm−2) possesses rapid reaction kinetics during the ORR processes. The electron transfer number (n) plays a crucial role in the ORR reaction path and procedure. Notably, the BPC-COF, BPA-COF and BDA-COF have high n obtained from rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE), demonstrating that ORR on these COFs is representative of four-electron reduction procedure (Fig. 3e). The electrochemical stability of these catalysts is investigated by i-t curves in chronoamperometry test. Fig. 3f displays the current retention profiles. BDA-COF shows the highest current retention of 88.5% within 20 h than BPC-COF (64.2% within 6 h) and BPA-COF (81.1% within 5 h). Especially, the BDA-COF has better stability than BPC-COF and BPA-COF, implying benzodithiophene-linked COF materials can significantly enhance the stability of the catalytic center. According to the better ORR performances of these COFs, the practical application of BPC-COF, BPA-COF and BDA-COF is further assessed as the cathode in Zn-air batteries (ZABs). The discharge polarization profiles of COF cathodes show a higher open-circuit voltage of 1.26 V (Fig. 3g). Moreover, the ZABs assembled BDA-COF cathode has a desirable power density of 101.8 mW cm−2, which is higher than the BPA-COF cathode (93.3 mW cm−2) and BPC-COF cathode (68.7 mW cm−2). The electrochemical long-term stability of ZABs equipped with these COF catalysts is measured by galvanostatic charge/discharge at current density with 5 mA cm−2. The BDA-COF has a stable voltage of 794 mV more than 600 cycles/h, as shown in Fig. 4 h. In contrast, BPC-COF and BPA-COF show unstable voltage changes at less than 245 and 428 cycles/h. Therefore, the BDA-COF presents good ORR performances and has great potential application in ZABs, which is beneficial for well-structural design with benzodithiophene units [46]. The highly catalytic activity of BDA-COF is mainly ascribed to the large surface area than BPC-COF and BPA-COF. To further elucidate the effect of pore size distribution on ORR activity, we compared BDA-COF with BPC-COF and BPA-COF. Both synthesized COFs show mesopores with 2 nm. However, the BPC-COF and BPA-COF show lower BET with 2561 and 2135 m2·g−1. Moreover, BPC-COF and BPA-COF show lower ORR activity than BDA-COF. This comparison underscores the importance of optimizing both surface area to achieve superior ORR performance. We implement a series of techniques of DFT calculations and characterizations to explore and study the catalytic mechanism and performance difference of heteroatom modification COFs-based catalysts. The charge and electronic distribution of COFs-based catalysts play a key role in recognition the active centers, adsorption/desorption of intermediates and catalytic procedures [45]. Fig. 4a–c show the electrostatic potential surface of BPC-COF, BPA-COF and BDA-COF. The charge of these COFs is concentrated on linkages and is disrupted by insertion of benzodithiophene, implying benzodithiophene unit can regulate the surface charge distribution of COF material. For the BPC-COF and BPA-COF, the negative charge is distributed around skeleton. However, the negative charge obviously extends to thiophene-S unite inside and outside the BDA-COF framework. Moreover, the positive charge can be observed in the Py unite, which is caused by the electronic migration from Py to benzodithiophene [47]. Therefore, after the electronic migration, the whole skeleton of BDA-COF displays the positive charge state that is very beneficial to the adsorption of O2. Notably, the linkages with different heteroatom doping regulate and alter the electronic state of BPC-COF, BPA-COF and BDA-COF, which has a significant influence on ORR procedures. Zeta potential is also used to study the charge state. As shown in Fig. 4d, the Zeta potential of BPC-COF and BPA-COF shows −6.13 and −5.06 mV. However, the Zeta potential of BDA-COF has a positive value of 5.25 mV. The changes of Zeta potential imply that linkage-engineered COFs regulate the electronic state, which is highly in accordance with the electrostatic potential surface [48]. Therefore, the excellently regulated electronic stability of BDA-COF results in higher halfwave potential (0.74 V vs. RHE) and onset potential (0.86 V vs. RHE) than BPC-COF and BPA-COF. The charge/electronic activity degree and migration ability of BPC-COF, BPA-COF and BDA-COF are studied by ultraviolet/visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV/Vis DRS), photoluminescence (PL) and conductivity tests. Fig. 4e shows the DRS spectra that BDA-COF has an apparent red-shift absorption signal than BPC-COF and BPA-COF. Moreover, the BDA-COF exhibits the smallest band gap with 2.12 eV than BPC-COF (2.16 eV) and BPA-COF (2.38 eV), as an inset in Fig. 4e. At the same time, the BDA-COF shows shoulder bands at ∼680 nm, implies that donor–acceptor brings about the intramolecular charge transfer in the frameworks [49]. This phenomenon is in line with the LUMO/HOMO energy level distribution of building blocks (Fig. 1d). Fig. 4f shows the PL emission spectra of as prepared COFs catalysts. Compared to BPC-COF and BPA-COF, the smallest PL intensity of BDA-COF suggests a prominent donor–acceptor structure, which is beneficial for high-efficiency charge separation. Time-resolution PL spectra are employed to analyze the PL lifetime. Compared to BPC-COF and BPA-COF, the BDA-COF has a moderate PL lifetime (Fig. 4g), indicating BDA-COF low electronic lifetime, conducting ultra-rapid electronic transportation [50]. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of BPC-COF, BPA-COF and BDA-COF show a weak peak (Fig. 4h). The intensity of BDA-COF is obviously higher than BPC-COF and BPA-COF, implying a substantial contribution of radicals from benzodithiophene linkage, generating high electronic activity and conductivity [48]. The large conductivity of BDA-COF is further proved by current–voltage tests (Fig. 4i). Consequently, the BDA-COF exhibits high charge/electronic migration ability, which gives rise to the ultra-high kinetic current density (7.6 mA cm−2 for BDA-COF, 2.34 mA cm−2 for BPA-COF, 1.84 mA cm−2 for BDA-COF) and rapid reaction kinetics during the ORR processes than BPC-COF and BPA-COF. Therefore, the aforementioned results successfully validated the viewpoint that various heteroatom (N, S) doping in COF-based ORR catalysts can change charge/electronic states, activity, migration ability, and regulate ORR performance. To further elucidate the electronic structure of BPC-COF, BPA-COF and BDA-COF and their impact on ORR activity, we conducted DFT calculations to determine the LUMO and HOMO energy levels. The LUMO and HOMO of BPC-COF are locally delocalized on pyrene (Fig. 5 a). However, the LUMO of BPA-COF and BDA-COF is situated on the dipyridyl and thiophene (Fig. 5b and c). The LUMO energy level of BDA-COF is located at −4.78 eV, while the HOMO energy level is at −5.97 eV. This narrow energy gap (1.19 eV) indicates strong electron delocalization and efficient charge transfer within the framework (Fig. 5c), which is beneficial for ORR catalysis. The LUMO energy level is also well-aligned with the energy levels of ORR intermediates (e.g., O2 and OOH*), facilitating electron transfer from the catalyst to the intermediates. In comparison, BPC-COF (Fig. 5a) and BPA-COF (Fig. 5b) exhibit wider energy gaps (2.19 and 2.1 eV, respectively), which hinder electron transfer and result in lower ORR activity. This difference in energy level matching further supports the superior catalytic performance of BDA-COF. Therefore, the distinctive electronic regulation and LUMO–HOMO distribution of BDA-COF easily promote charge transfer and enhance electronic activation [51]. The projected density of states (PDOS) indicates that the population of electrons on BDA-COF p-orbitals (Fig. 5f) shows much denser and more active than BPC-COF (Fig. 5d) and BPA-COF (Fig. 5e). Moreover, in the Fermi level, the contribution of p-orbitals in S is higher than N and C in the COFs catalysts, implying the benzodithiophene modulation endows BDA-COF with outstanding semiconductor properties and high electronic activity degree [52]. This is beneficial for the adsorption of O2 and *OOH intermediate, resulting in high diffusion kinetics and catalytic activity. Furthermore, the charge density difference of prepared COF-based ORR catalysts (Fig. S33) suggests that the electron distribution is affected by biphenyl, dipyridyl and thiophene organic linkers, bringing about higher electron delocalization in BDA-COF than BPC-COF and BPA-COF. The combined XPS, DFT, and linker analysis provides strong evidence that the electronic structure of BDA-COF than BPC-COF and BPA-COF, particularly the electron-rich BDA unit, plays a crucial role in enhancing ORR catalytic activity. The BDA unit promotes electron migration, optimizes LUMO/HOMO energy level matching, and enhances interactions with ORR intermediates, all of which contribute to the superior performance of BDA-COF. The probable catalytic site of various heteroatom modification COF-based ORR catalysts is evaluated by combining solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and theoretical calculation in order to obtain a good understanding of ORR behaviors. The 13C NMR of BPC-COF, BPA-COF and BDA-COF is shown in Fig. 5g, an obvious peak at chemical shift at 156 ppm can be observed, which is ascribed to the C=N. This C atom signal on C=N suggests complete chemical conversion between CHO and NH2 groups in building units and formation COFs. Moreover, the adjoining C (denoted as 1, inset chemical structure) atom in N and S of dipyridyl and thiophene displays various chemical shifts at 152 and 124 ppm, respectively. The chemical shift is evidently different with biphenyl (128 ppm), implying the C atom at 1 position is the catalytic site [53]. To obtain a readily comprehensible ORR procedure on COF catalyst, in situ FT-IR technique is applied to monitor and identify relevant intermediates and production. As demonstrated in Fig. 5h, two obvious peaks at 3080–2910 and ∼1610 cm−1 are easily visible on BDA-COF catalyst, corresponding to the stretching vibration and bending vibration of the O–H bond on H2O molecule [54]. Particularly, the intensity of the two signals increasingly increases with the descended applied potential. This result indicates a four-electron transfer pathway to produce H2O driven by BDA-COF catalyst. In addition, a distinct blue shift from 3080 to 2910 cm−1 is ascribed to hydrogen bond interaction during the H2O formation process. The signal of O–O bond in adsorbed *O2 on the surface of BDA-COF is also found at 1560 cm−1. At the same time, the peak at 1160 cm−1 is more and more evident, corresponding to the adsorbed *OOH intermediate. However, the important signal of O–H and *OOH in BPA-COF (Fig. S33) and BPC-COF (Fig. S34) is obviously lower than BDA-COF catalyst, suggests and elucidates the effects of different linkers on the active center. This discussion has been carefully added to the revised manuscript and Supporting Information. Therefore, the above-mentioned in situ FT-IR analyses show the four-electron process on BDA-COF-based ORR catalyst with the participation of *O2 and *OOH intermediates [55]. The catalytic mechanism and ORR procedures are further studied by free energy theoretical computations. Fig. 5i shows the computational free energy diagrams that include four-electron procedures of BPC-COF, BPA-COF and BDA-COF catalysts are downhill at U = 0 V, suggesting a spontaneous exothermal process [56]. However, after the potential increased to 1.23 V, the first electron transfer step (*O2 to *OOH) of all COF-based catalysts displayed the highest uphill free energy change (Fig. 5j). In the meantime, the lowest ΔG of BDA-COF is 0.11 eV than BPA-COF (0.76 eV) and BPC-COF (1.06 eV), implying high-efficient ORR catalytic activity of BDA-COF, which is consistent with ORR experimental results. Consequently, the ORR procedures on these COF-based catalysts is proposed based on the above theoretical and experiment analysis and depicted in Fig. 5k. 4 Conclusions In summary, we design and construct various linkage-engineered covalent organic frameworks as high-activity metal-free ORR electrocatalysts. Conspicuously, the highly-ordered pore structure is first time synthesized in a COF-based ORR catalyst, which is very beneficial for studying the O2 diffusion behavior. Moreover, different heteroatom-modified COF catalysts can accurately regulate the electronic state, establish an appropriate adsorption/desorption pathway for relevant intermediates and enhance oxygen reduction performance. By altering the electronic characteristic of building units, the benzodithiophene-linked BDA-COF exhibits excellent ORR behaviors with high onset potential and half-wave potential comparable to recently reported COF-based catalysts. Remarkably, the BDA-COF-driven Zn-air battery shows satisfactory power density with 101.8 mW cm−2 and durability with 600 cycles/h. Systematic experiments and sufficient theoretical calculations suggest that the prominent ORR performances are closely correlated with regulating the electron and charge ability of these linkers. Particularly, the thiophene-S in benzodithiophene group easily facilitates charge transfer and O2 diffusion and enhances electronic activation degree. As much, the linkage engineering in covalent organic frameworks provides a convictive paradigm to optimize and elevate electrocatalytic performance from an atomic-level viewpoint.

        "dc:description": "Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) play a crucial role in metal-free electrocatalysts for promoting oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to their adjustable skeleton structure and catalytic activity. While it is true that numerous studies have explored COFs for ORR, the critical gap by providing a systematic framework for ligand-driven electronic state manipulation is essential for designing highly active COF-based ORR catalysts. Herein, a series of COF-based metal-free materials have been conceived and synthesized by linkage-engineered strategy with dicarboxaldehyde (BPC), bipyridine-dicarbaldehyde (BPA) and benzodithiophene (BDA) as electronic linkages. Consequently, by incorporating different linkages into COFs, the surface area, electronic state, hydrophobic properties and affinities towards intermediates are optimized. Notably, the benzodithiophene-linked COF (denoted as BDA-COF) has greater catalytic ability with a half-wave potential of 0.74 V vs. RHE and an onset potential of 0.86 V vs. RHE than dicarboxaldehyde (denoted as BPC-COF) and dicarbaldehyde (denoted as BPA-COF). Relevant characterizations, in situ techniques and theoretical calculations confirm that thiophene-S-based COF promotes the electronic migration and enhances the interaction with the intermediate. The result provides insight into for illustration of a high-performance COF-based electrocatalyst via a linkage-engineered approach.",
