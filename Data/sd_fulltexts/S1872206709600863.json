The hydrated alkali metal halides showed much higher catalytic activity than the anhydrous alkali metal halides. Sodium iodide dihydrate was found to be the most efficient among them and it gave a 97% yield of pro- pylene carbonate at 120 °C under 1 MPa within 1.5 h. The corresponding cyclic carbonates from CO 2 and other epoxides using sodium iodide dihydrate as catalyst were also successfully synthesized. Key words: carbon dioxide; propylene oxide; propylene carbonate; cyclic carbonate; hydrated alkali metal halide The chemical fixation of carbon dioxide has attracted much attention because CO 2 is an abundant, inexpensive, and non- toxic C 1 feed stock. The synthesis of cyclic carbonates from epoxides and CO 2 is one of the few industrial processes that utilize CO 2 as a raw material [1,2]. Cyclic carbonates such as propylene carbonate (PC) are excellent aprotic polar solvents and they are used as intermediates for the synthesis of dimethyl carbonate, polycarbonates, and fine chemicals [3]. A wide range of catalysts have been developed for the coupling reac- tion between CO 2 and epoxides [1–4] such as alkali metal halides [5–8], quaternary ammonium and phosphonium salts [9,10], metal oxides [11], transition metal complexes [12–14], zeolites [15], smectites [16], ion-exchange resins [17], func- tional polymers [18], and ionic liquids [19]. Among these catalysts, alkali metal halides are important and classic catalysts for the coupling reaction between CO 2 and epoxides. Kihare et al. [5] reported that alkali metal halides are efficient catalysts for PC synthesis in the presence of a crown ether as a co-catalyst. Huang et al. [6] discovered that NaI/PPh 3 /PhOH could catalyze the cycloaddition of CO 2 and propylene oxide (PO) effectively but the catalytic system had low or no activity without PPh 3 or PhOH. Song et al. [7] re- cently reported that KI had high catalytic activity for PC syn- thesis in the presence of β-cyclodextrin. However, all the above-mentioned catalytic systems need toxic and/or high concentrations of an organic co-catalyst. Sun et al. [8] demon- strated that alkali metal halides have excellent catalytic activity for PC synthesis in water and they found a relationship between high catalytic activity and water content. However, because of the generation of plenty 1,2-propylene glycerol (PG) as a by-product, the PC selectivity was low. In this work, hydrated alkali metal halides were used as a catalyst for the coupling reaction between CO 2 and epoxides and we obtained high yields of cyclic carbonates with high selectivity without any co-catalyst or solvent. 1 Experimental All reagents were used without treatment. All coupling re- actions were carried out in 250 ml stainless steel autoclaves equipped with a magnetic stirrer. In a typical reaction, the reactor was charged with 0.93 g NaI⋅2H 2 O (0.005 mol) and 29 g PO (0.5 mol). After the reactor was sealed, the reaction sys- tem was heated to a designated temperature. CO 2 was intro- duced into the reactor while the reaction pressure was kept constant by connecting the reactor with a CO 2 reservoir. After ZHOU Xi et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2010, 31: 765–768 the required reaction time, the reactor was cooled to room temperature and the unreacted CO 2 was vented. The product mixture was analyzed using a GC (Shanghai Analytical Co., GC-112A) equipped with a flame-ionization detector. The structure of the product was determined by GC-MS (HP 6890/5973). 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Effect of the catalyst on PC synthesis Without any organic co-catalyst or solvent, the effects of various catalysts on PC synthesis were investigated and the results are summarized in Table 1. The catalytic activity of the anhydrous alkali metal halides (NaI, LiCl, LiBr, and LiI) was low without the synergetic catalytic effect of the co-catalyst. LiI had the highest activity among the tested compounds; however, the yield of PC was only 13% (entries 1–4). When the hydrated alkali metal halides were used as a catalyst, the yield of PC increased notably (entries 5–8). Each of the hydrated alkali metal halides showed higher catalytic activity than the corresponding anhydrous alkali metal halides. This was espe- cially the case for sodium iodide dihydrate (NaI⋅2H 2 O) and lithium iodide trihydrate (LiI⋅3H 2 O) and the yield of PC was over 94%. Although the activity of LiI⋅3H 2 O was slightly higher than that of NaI⋅2H 2 O, the amount of PG by-product increased by about 0.7% with the former catalyst. Moreover, LiI⋅3H 2 O is more expensive than NaI⋅2H 2 O. As a result, NaI⋅2H 2 O was selected as a catalyst for the coupling reaction between CO 2 and PO. Sun et al. [8] found a relationship between high catalytic activity and water content when using anhydrous alkali metal halides as catalysts and they pointed out that the coordination of a H atom from a water molecule with an O atom from pro- pylene oxide (PO) by hydrogen bonding resulted in the po- larization of the C–O bonds, which allows for easy PO ring opening. NaI⋅2H 2 O dissolved in the PO and the crystal water in NaI⋅2H 2 O was released as “free water” and, therefore, 1 equivalent of NaI⋅2H 2 O becomes 1 equivalent of NaI and 2 equivalents of H 2 O. For comparison, 2 equivalents of H 2 O (calculated using NaI) was added into the coupling reaction system using anhydrous NaI as a catalyst. As shown in Table 1, the yield of PC was 29% (entry 9), which is almost three times the yield of PC in the absence of H 2 O (entries 1 and 9). How- ever, this yield is still much lower than the yield of PC when NaI⋅2H 2 O is used as a catalyst (entries 5 and 9). The solubility of NaI (2.1 g/100 g PO) in PO is lower than that of NaI⋅2H 2 O (9.5 g/100 g PO), which may be the reason for the lower PC yield. A PC yield of about 87% may be obtained using NaI as a catalyst in the presence of 10 equivalents of water (calculated using PO). However, the selectivity for PC is only 96% be- cause of the production of the by-product PG (entry 10). Moreover, a long induction period exists when the amount of NaI⋅2H 2 O is decreased to 0.5 mol% and the yield of the PC quickly drops to 23% (entry 11). As shown in Table 1, the PC yield is almost constant as the amount of NaI⋅2H 2 O is increased from 1.0 mol% to 2.0 mol% (entry 12). Because the reaction mechanism for the coupling reactions with NaI⋅2H 2 O as a catalyst is similar to that for catalysis by alkali metal halides in the presence of H 2 O as reported by Sun et al. [8], we do not discuss it further in this paper. 2.2 Effect of reaction pressure, temperature, and time on PC synthesis The effect of reaction pressure was investigated at 120 °C over 1 h using NaI⋅2H 2 O as the catalyst and the results are shown in Fig. 1 (a). The yield of PC increased with increasing CO 2 pressure in the low pressure range (0.5–3.0 MPa). It has been reported that two gas-liquid phases exist in the coupling reaction system [7]. In this work, the coupling reaction mainly occurred in the liquid phase because the catalyst was dissolved in PO. Higher pressure can improve the concentration of CO 2 in the liquid and thus improve transfer between the two gas-liquid phases. This may be the reason for the increased PC yield with increasing reaction pressure at low pressure. How- ever, the yield of PC only changed slightly with increasing pressure when the reaction pressure was over 1.0 MPa. In addition, the PC yield was almost constant after increasing the reaction pressure from 3.0 MPa to 4.0 MPa. The optimum CO 2 pressure is, therefore, 1.0 MPa. Figure 1(b) shows the dependence of the PC yield on the reaction temperature. As expected, the coupling reaction was sensitive to temperature. From 80 to 100 °C, the PC yield was very low (about 20%). However, the PC yield quickly in- Table 1 Effect of catalysts during propylene carbonate synthesis Entry Catalyst Yield a (%) Selectivity (%) 1 NaI 8 > 99 2 LiCl 2 > 99 3 LiBr 3 > 99 4 LiI 13 > 99 5 NaI⋅2H 2 O 94 > 99 6 LiCl⋅H 2 O 12 > 99 7 LiBr⋅2H 2 O 76 > 99 8 LiI⋅3H 2 O 96 99 9 b NaI 29 99 10 c NaI 87 96 11 d NaI⋅2H 2 O 23 > 99 12 e NaI⋅2H 2 O 94 > 99 Reaction conditions: PO 29 g (0.5 mol), catalyst 1 mol% (calculated using PO), temperature 120 °C, reaction pressure 2.0 MPa, time 1 h. a Calculated from GC analysis. b Adding 2 equivalents of H 2 O (calculated by NaI). c Adding 10 equivalents of H 2 O (calculated by NaI). d 0.5 mol% NaI⋅2H 2 O. e 2.0 mol% NaI⋅2H 2 O. ZHOU Xi et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2010, 31: 765–768 creased to 94% at 120 °C and it did not change remarkably by increasing the temperature further. In addition, the yield of the by-product PG increased to about 0.5% at 140 °C, and this increased the hydrolysis of the raw material PO. It is notable that the reaction temperature remained constant when the ini- tial temperature was 80–100 °C. However, temperature eleva- tion occurred when using an initial temperature higher than 120 °C (Fig. 2). This is due to the coupling reaction between CO 2 and PO being a strongly exothermic reaction. Figure 1(c) shows the effect of reaction time on the yield of PC at 120 °C under 1.0 MPa pressure. As shown in Fig. 1(c), the PC yield was 90% at reaction time longer than 0.6 h and a slow increase occurs from 90% to 97% by prolonging the reaction time to 1.5 h. Finally, the yield was almost constant with a further increase in reaction time suggesting that the optimum reaction time for this coupling reaction system was 1.5 h. 2.3 Coupling reaction between CO 2 and other epoxides We also studied the coupling reactions between CO 2 and other epoxides using NaI⋅2H 2 O at 120 o C and 1.0 MPa. The results are summarized in Table 2 and they show that the catalytic system can also be applied to other terminal epoxides with high resultant PC yields. However, when cyclohexene oxide (1d) was used as a reactant, the yield of the corre- sponding cyclic carbonate (2d) was only 19% even after pro- longing the reaction time to 6.0 h, which is similar to the result reported previously [7,8]. The reason may be that the β-carbon of the cyclohexene oxide suffers from high hindrance because of the two rings [8]. 3 Conclusions Hydrated alkali metal halides are efficient catalysts for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates from CO 2 and epoxides. By comparison with similar catalytic systems reported previously, they showed high activity without requiring an organic co-catalyst or a solvent. These reactions were carried using the synergistic effect between halide anions and crystal water. In conclusion, this work provides a simple, green and efficient 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 0 20 40 60 80 100 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 0 20 40 60 80 100 01234 7 27 47 67 87 (2) (1) Y i eld or selectivity (% ) Reaction pressure (MPa) (a) (1) (2) Y i eld or selectivity (% ) Temperature ( o C) (b) Y i eld of PC (% ) Reaction time (h) (c) Fig. 1.
