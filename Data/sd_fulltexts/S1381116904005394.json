Graphical abstract Esterification of salicylic acid with phenol to synthesize phenylsalicylate over solid acids as catalysts has been studied. Catalytic activity of different oxides such as Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2 and their sulfated forms and zeolites such as Na-Y, Na-β, ZSM-5 and their protonated forms have been investigated. Catalytic activity studies have been conducted in liquid phase under refluxing conditions. A systematic study has been made to find the effect of amount of the catalyst, the molar ratio of alcohol to acid and the duration of reaction on the synthesis of the ester. Product analysis has been done on gas chromatograph and further characterized by GC–MS, IR, 1H NMR and 13C NMR. All the catalysts have been found to be active and exhibit 100% selectivity towards the formation of phenylsalycilate as the reaction product. The catalytic activities of sulfated oxides and protonated forms of zeolites are found to be higher than their parent forms. The catalysts have been characterized for their surface acidity and BET surface area. Keywords Esterification Salol Oxides Zeolites Sulfated oxides and catalysts. 1 Introduction Selective esterification of bifunctional carboxylic acids in the presence of aromatic alcohol is a useful organic synthesis reaction. The esters thus obtained are utilized to prepare fine chemicals used in the synthesis of drugs, food preservatives, plasticizers, pharmaceuticals, solvents, perfumes and cosmetics [1–3]. Generally phenylesters of salicylic acid are prepared under liquid phase, refluxing the reactants (carboxylic acid and phenol) in the presence of small amount of conc. H2SO4, HCl, POCl3 or sulfonic acid as the catalyst [4]. Although many effective and reliable methods for the preparation of aromatic esters exist, there is still a good scope for research towards finding eco-friendly and economically viable processes. The use of the above mentioned catalysts is undesirable from the environmental point of view as these chemicals are corrosive and generally encounter the problems of handling and transportation. Moreover reusability of the catalysts cannot be expected. Hence there are numerous global efforts to replace these environmentally harmful chemicals with more ecofriendly and less expensive catalysts. Solid acids such as zeolites, oxides, aluminophosphates and their modified forms have been extensively studied as possible alternatives to conventional Lewis/Bronsted acid catalysts [5–10]. The oxides and zeolites possess on their surface and/or in the pores acidic sites. This property has been exploited in the synthesis of several organic fine chemicals via acid catalyzed reactions. Acidity of oxides found to increase on sulfate ion treatment [11] and that of zeolites by protonation [12]. The increase in acidity is found due to an increase in the number and the strength of acid sites. In several reactions it is observed that the yield and selectivity of a product depends not only on the concentration but also on the strength of the acid sites on these solid acids. We have earlier [13–18] observed that solid acids such as modified forms of zeolites and oxides catalyze very efficiently esterification and alkylation reactions. Phenylsalicylate, the phenyl ester of salicylic acid is an important chemical. It is used in medicine as internal antiseptic under the name salol. It also finds applications in paints, waxes, varnishes due to its ability to absorb UV light in the range of 290–325nm. Esterification of salicylic acid with phenol in the presence of POCl3 as the catalyst or transesterification of methyl salicylate with phenol in the presence of alkali or alkaline earth phosphates are the existing routes for the synthesis of phenyl salicylate [19]. The present investigation is aimed to find out the catalytic activity and the effect of sulfate ion treatment of oxides and protonation of zeolites in a reaction between phenol and salicylic acid to synthesize phenyl salycilate (salol). Here we report that the solid acids such as alumina, silica, zirconia, zeolites (Y, β and ZSM5) and their modified forms exhibit good catalytic activity in the esterification reaction between salicylic acid and phenol. The results obtained are very encouraging in the sense that solid acids not only show 100% selectivity but also high activity towards the formation of phenyl salicylate. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of hydrated Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2 and their sulfated forms Initially Al(OH) 3 gel was prepared by adding drop wise liquor ammonia into 750cm3 of a hot (≈80°C) aqueous solution of aluminum nitrate containing 100g of the salt. The precipitate was separated by filtration, washed free from anions, dried overnight at 120°C in an air oven and calcined at 550°C for 5h to obtain hydrated alumina. Similarly hydrated ZrO2 was obtained starting from zirconium oxychloride, 25g of ZrOCl2 were dissolved in 250ml deionised water, and liquor ammonia was used as the precipitating agent. Hydrated SiO2 was obtained starting from sodium silicate solution containing 25g of the salt in 250ml of deionised water using conc. HNO3 as the precipitating agent. Hydrated oxides i.e., hydroxides of Al, Si and Zr dried at 120°C were modified by adsorbing sulfate ions on their surface by mixing the individual solid sample at room temperature with 1M H2SO4 (1ml/g) for 1h. The solid was then separated by filtration dried at 120°C for 24h and further calcined at 550°C for 6h. The samples were designated as SAl, SSi and SZr, respectively. 2.2 Preparation of protonated forms of zeolites Zeolites β, Y and ZSM-5 were obtained in their sodium form from UCL (United Catalyst India Ltd.). These zeolites were modified by exchanging the Na+ ions of the parent zeolite by H+ ions. The protonated forms of the zeolites were prepared by the standard method reported in the literature [20,21]. Briefly the procedure followed is as follows: 20g of the zeolite calcined at 550°C was immersed in 250cm3 of ammonium nitrate solution (1M) containing 20g of the salt. The mixture was stirred overnight, filtered and washed with deionised water. The solid was then dried at 120°C in an air oven overnight and calcined at 550°C for 5h to obtain the protonated forms viz., H-β, H-Y and H-ZSM5. 2.3 Characterization of the catalysts All the oxides, zeolites and their sulfated and protonated forms as prepared by the procedures given under the above section have been characterized for their total surface acidity by TPD of NH3 and n-butylamine back titration method [22] using dry benzene as the solvent. BET surface area of the samples was also measured at liquid nitrogen temperature (using NOVA-100VER: 3.7 instrument). 2.4 Catalytic activity studies The catalytic esterification reactions were carried out in liquid phase in a 250cm3 RB flask equipped with reflux condenser. In each reaction 1g of the catalyst was added to a mixture of salicylic acid and phenol (1:1.5 molar ratio). The mixture was refluxed on a heating mantle. The temperature of the reaction mixture was maintained in between 150 and 160°C for a predetermined time. Different reaction-runs were conducted by varying the reaction parameters such as molar ratio of the reactant, weight of the catalyst, reaction period and the catalyst type in order to optimize the reaction conditions to get good yield and high selectivity of the product, salol. After a stipulated time the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, acetone was added to dissolve the unreacted salicylic acid in the reaction mixture and filtered to separate out the catalyst. The filtrate was analyzed by gas chromatograph using 20% SE-30 column coupled with FID. The ester was identified by comparing with a standard and further confirmed by GC–MS, IR, 1H NMR and 13C NMR. The % yield of phenyl salicylate was calculated based on the conversion of salicylic acid using the following expression (14): Conversion of salicylic acid ( SA ) ( % ) = 100 − 100 × [ salicylic acid ] [ salicylic acid ] + [ phenyl salicylate ] . 3 Results and discussions The catalysts used and their physicochemical properties such as BET surface area, total surface acidity are listed in Table 1 . The data in this table indicate that in general sulfation or protonation of oxides and zeolites exhibited a moderate increase in their surface area. The surface area of the zeolites and their protonated forms are quite in agreement with reported values [21]. The total acidity measured by TPD shows that, both sulfated oxides and protonated forms of zeolites have stronger acidic sites than their parent forms. The decreasing order of the catalyst acidity observed is as given below: Oxides : SZr > SSi > SAl > Zr O 2 > Si O 2 > A l 2 O 3 , zeolites : H- β > H-Y > H-ZSM 5 > Na-ZSM 5 > Na-Y > Na- β . The above order of acidity of oxides clearly indicate that the interaction of sulfate ion during sulfating depends on the acidic and/or basic nature of the surface of the oxide used. 3.1 Catalytic activity studies The GC analysis of the products from the catalytic esterification reactions indicated the presence of only three components in the reaction mixture. A comparison of the retention times of these components with authentic samples and GC-MS, IR, 1H NMR and 13C NMR confirmed the presence of only phenol, salicylic acid and phenyl salicylate in the product mixture. At the outset it is noticed from these experiments that the oxides, zeolites and their modified forms are found to exhibit 100% selectivity towards salol formation. The results of the experiments carried out in the presence of various catalysts and the percentage yield of phenyl salicylate obtained are given in Table 2 . It is clear from the data that sulfated oxides and protonated forms of zeolites are much better catalysts for phenyl salicylate formation than their simple oxides and sodium forms of zeolites. The following order of catalytic activity towards the formation of salol was observed in the case of modified oxides and zeolites: Sulphated oxides : SZr > SSi > SAl, zeolite : H- β > H-Y > H-ZSM- 5. The catalytic activity towards conversion of salicylic acid was found to increase with increase in total acidity of the catalysts (Fig. 1 ). The data in the Table 2 also indicate that the simple oxides are more active than the sodium forms of zeolites though the latter possess higher acidity than the former. It confirms that it is not just the concentration of the acid sites but their strength also plays an important role in catalyzing a particular reaction [23]. Further investigations of these reactions were carried out on zeolite H-β and sulfated zirconia as these catalysts exhibited good yield and selectivity, to optimize the reaction conditions to get good conversions. 3.1.1 Effect of amount of catalyst Experiments were conducted by varying the amount of the catalyst between 0 and 2g keeping phenol and salicylic acid molar ratio 1.5:1 and the reaction temperature 150–160°C. The reactions were carried out for 6h and the products were analyzed as explained earlier. The results are represented by plotting the amount of catalyst versus percentage yield of phenyl salicylate in Fig. 2 . It is noticed that without catalyst the reaction did not occur to yield salol. This indicates that the oxides and zeolite are catalyzing the esterification reaction. An increase in the conversion of SA to phenyl salicylate from 39 to 72% was noticed when the amount of H-β increased from 0.25 to 1.5g. For sulfated zirconia this increase has been found to be from 31.4 to 60% only. The increase in conversion of SA with the amount of the catalyst may be attributed to an increase in the number active sites available for the esterification reaction. However beyond 1g of the catalyst % yield of salol remained almost constant. 3.1.2 Effect of phenol to salicylic acid molar ratio The reactions were carried out using different phenol to salicylic acid molar ratio by increasing the amount of phenol only. However, studies with higher concentration of salicylic acid could not be conducted due to solubility restrictions. The results are summarized in Fig. 3 . The % of phenyl salicylate increases from 61 to 70% on varying phenol to SA ratio from 1:1 to 2:1 for H-β. In the case of SZ, for the same molar ratio region the % yield of phenyl salicylate is lower than that of H-β and remained between 45 and 59%. The above results show that the yield of product increased with increasing the molar ratio of phenol to acid. This is mainly due to the fact that the esterification reaction of carboxylic acid with phenol is reversible and an increase in the molar ratio of phenol to acid leads to a shift of the equilibrium to the direction of producing the ester. However after, a particular concentration of phenol no significant increase in the product was noticed. 3.1.3 Effect of reaction time The effect of reaction time on the % yield of phenyl salicylate in the esterification reaction between salicylic acid and phenol is represented in Fig. 4 . There is an increase in the amount of product with increase in reaction time in the presence of both H-β and SZ catalysts. The optimum reaction time has been found to be 6h. At all reaction times zeolite sample was found to be more active than the oxide. The selectivity towards phenyl salicylate remains 100% in all cases. 3.1.4 Reusability of the catalyst In order to know whether the catalysts would succumb to poisoning and lose catalytic activity during the esterification reaction, the solid catalyst was recovered after the reaction by filtration and dried at 120°C to remove acetone used for dissolving the reactants and products and reused as catalyst in the reaction between salicylic acid with phenol without any activation of catalyst. Such studies are conducted with H-β and SZ. The experiments were repeated and the results obtained are given in Table 3 . This data show that the recovered H-β essentially retained all its catalytic activity, whereas sulfated zirconia shows considerable decrease in catalytic activity during the period of its reuse. 3.2 Conclusion A liquid phase esterification reaction between salicylic acid and phenol in the presence of hydrated oxides (alumina, silica and zirconia) and zeolites (Y, ZSM5 and β) and the sulfated forms of oxides and protonated forms of zeolites as catalysts yield salol with 100% selectivity. Of all the catalysts used H-β and sulfated zirconia exhibited good conversion of salicylic acid, 70 and 59%, respectively. It is also noticed that β zeolite catalyst can be reused to get good selectivity and activity.

Catalytic activity of different oxides such as Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2 and their sulfated forms and zeolites such as Na-Y, Na-β, ZSM-5 and their protonated forms have been investigated. Catalytic activity studies have been conducted in liquid phase under refluxing conditions. A systematic study has been made to find the effect of amount of the catalyst, the molar ratio of alcohol to acid and the duration of reaction on the synthesis of the ester. Product analysis has been done on gas chromatograph and further characterized by GC–MS, IR, 1H NMR and 13C NMR. All the catalysts have been found to be active and exhibit 100% selectivity towards the formation of phenylsalycilate as the reaction product. The catalytic activities of sulfated oxides and protonated forms of zeolites are found to be higher than their parent forms. The catalysts have been characterized for their surface acidity and BET surface area.",
