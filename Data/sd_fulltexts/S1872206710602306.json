DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(10)60230-6 NO x Reduction on Fully Formulated Lean NO x Trap Catalysts Subjected to Simulated Road Aging: Insights from Steady-State Experiments Jin WANG, Yaying JI, Uschi GRAHAM, Caio CESAR SPINDOLA DE OLIVEIRA, Mark CROCKER* Center for Applied Energy Research, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40511, USA Abstract: Fully formulated lean NO x trap (LNT) catalysts of the type Pt/Rh/BaO/Al 2 O 3 were prepared with and without incorporation of CeO 2 -ZrO 2 in the washcoat, and their NO x reduction behavior was evaluated in steady-state, continuous flow experiments. In the fresh state, CeO 2 -ZrO 2 addition was found to exert little effect on NO x reduction activity using H 2 , CO, and NH 3 as the reductants. However, after simulated road aging, NO x reduction activity was significantly impaired for the CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -free catalyst, whereas the performance of the CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -containing analog was affected to only a minor degree. These differences are explained on the basis of high-resolution trans- mission electron microscopy measurements showing that Pt supported on CeO 2 -ZrO 2 remained highly dispersed after aging, whereas Pt supported on BaO/Al 2 O 3 underwent significant sintering. In addition, the Pt/CeO 2 -ZrO 2 component did not accumulate sulfur during aging, unlike Pt/BaO/Al 2 O 3 for which significant sulfation of the Ba phase occurred. For both catalysts, selectivity to NH 3 in NO and NO 2 re- duction by H 2 increased after catalyst aging, indicative of a change in the relative surface coverages of N and H ad-atoms on the precious metal sites.

Lean-burn engines provide more efficient fuel combustion and lower CO 2 emissions compared with traditional stoichiometric engines [1]. However, the effective removal of NO x from lean exhaust represents a challenge to the automotive industry. Conventional three-way catalysts are highly effective for control of nitrogen oxides, CO, and hydrocarbons from stoichiometric engine exhaust but are not effective for NO x mitigation under lean conditions. Of the various approaches proposed for lean NO x removal, lean NO x trap (LNT) catalysts represent a promising technology, particularly for lean-burn gasoline and light-duty diesel applications [1,2]. LNT catalysts are typically composed of at least one precious-metal compo- nent and one alkali or alkaline-earth component which are supported on a high surface area refractory oxide. These cata- lysts operate in a cyclic manner, whereby the catalyst stores or \"traps\" NO x as nitrate species during lean period of operation. Periodically a short rich pulse is introduced so that the trapped NO x is released and reduced to N 2 , thereby regenerating the trapping capacity of the catalyst [3]. In previous work [4,5] we observed that the addition of a Jin WANG et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 736â€“745 Ce-Zr mixed oxide to a fully formulated Pt/Rh/BaO/Al 2 O 3 LNT catalyst significantly improved NO x storageâ€“reduction performance under leanâ€“rich cycling conditions. This was particularly evident after catalyst aging under simulated road conditions [5]. Several other recent studies have likewise shown that the addition of ceria-containing mixed oxides can impart beneficial properties to model LNT catalysts. For ex- ample, ceria possesses significant NO x storage capacity [6â€“10], particularly at low to moderate temperatures (< 400 qC), which may help to supplement the NO x storage capacity of the main alkaline earth or alkali metal storage component. Ceria also promotes H 2 formation under rich conditions via the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction [11], which can be expected to facilitate catalyst regeneration and desulfation. Furthermore, LNTs incorporating ceria show improved resistance to deactivation during sulfation (as reflected by the NO x storage efficiency), and require lower temperatures to restore the NO x storage efficiency to its pre-sulfation value [12â€“16]. Ceria and ceria-zirconia can also be beneficially employed as a support for the Ba phase in Ba-based LNTs [17â€“20]. Another effect associated with the presence of ceria in LNTs is increased selectivity for N 2 during NO x reduction (at the expense of NH 3 ), which can be attributed in part to the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of ceria. Specifically, NH 3 formed in the front of the LNT can subsequently undergo reaction with stored oxygen in the rear of the catalyst to afford N 2 (and pos- sibly NO and N 2 O) [21â€“23], in addition to reacting with stored NO x [24]. Furthermore, oxygen stored in the front of the cata- lyst can be expected to consume a portion of the reductant as the reaction front moves through the catalyst, thereby de- creasing the effective reductant/NO x ratio and favoring the formation of N 2 over NH 3 . Finally, it should be appreciated that differences may also arise on the basis that Pt supported on BaO/Al 2 O 3 and CeO 2 (or its mixed oxides) may possess in- trinsic differences with respect to their activity and selectivity in NO x reduction with reductants such as H 2 , CO, and NH 3 . In this work, we sought to study the effect of adding CeO 2 -ZrO 2 to a Pt/Rh/BaO/Al 2 O 3 catalyst on its NO x reduction properties before and after aging. The transient nature of lean-rich cycling experiments, coupled with the integral nature of monolithic catalysts, results in complex spatial and temporal phenomena within the catalyst sample with respect to reactant and product concentrations [21,22]. These phenomena make it difficult to directly relate the outlet gas composition to the chemistry taking place inside the catalyst. Therefore, in this study steady-state, continuous flow experiments were per- formed in an attempt to avoid these difficulties in data inter- pretation. The key step in eliminating the transient behavior of the LNT is to decouple the NO x storage/release process from the reduction reactions [23]. This was accomplished by flow- ing NO x and reductant species simultaneously over the catalyst. In this paper we report our findings. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation Two fully formulated Ba-based LNT catalysts were used in this study, the compositions of which are shown in Table 1. The catalysts are denoted as 30-0 and 30-100Z, where â€œ30â€� refers to the loading of BaO in the catalyst (in g/L) and â€œ0â€� or â€œ100Zâ€� refers to the loading of CeO 2 -ZrO 2 (i.e., 0 or 100 g/L). As shown in the table, the catalysts have the same nominal loadings of Pt and Rh. The BaO component (21.5 wt%) was supported on alumina, while bare alumina was also used as a balance to bring the total washcoat loading up to 260 g/L. A detailed breakdown of the Pt loadings on the three different types of powder in the catalyst washcoats is given in Table 2. Details of the catalyst preparation have been described else- where [4,5]. In both cases, the washcoat was applied to 4Æ�Æ� u 6Æ�Æ� cordierite monolith substrates, possessing a cell density of 400 cpsi and a wall thickness of 6.5 mil. 1.2 Catalyst characterization Surface area and pore volume measurements on the fresh and aged catalysts were performed according to the BET method by nitrogen adsorption at â€“196 Â°C using a Micromer- itics Tri-Star system. Prior to the measurements catalyst sam- ples (washcoat and monolith) were ground to a fine powder and outgassed overnight at 160 Â°C under vacuum. The dispersion of precious metal (Pt+Rh) was determined with a Micromeritics AutoChem II Analyzer by means of pulsed H 2 chemisorption at dry ice temperature (â€“78 o C). OSC values of the catalysts were determined under lean-rich cycling conditions as described previously [4]. High-resolution transmission electron micros- copy (HRTEM) investigations were performed using a 200-keV field emission analytical transmission electron mi- Table 1 Composition of catalysts used in this work Catalyst loading a (g/L) Sample Pt Rh BaO CeO 2 -ZrO 2 b Al 2 O 3 c 30-0 3.53 (100) 0.71 (20) 30 0 balance 30-100Z 3.53 (100) 0.71 (20) 30 100 balance The numbers in brackets are in g/cuft. a Nominal loadings.

Materials for the TEM analysis were powdered samples and minute amounts were supported on copper grids. 1.3 Catalyst aging procedure Catalyst aging was performed on a synthetic gas bench using cores (2.1 cm diameter u 7.4 cm long) drilled out from the LNT monoliths. The protocol used for the rapid aging has been detailed in earlier publications [5]. This method is designed to simulate the road aging of a LNT catalyst used in conjunction with a diesel particulate filter (DPF). Each aging cycle is composed of three modes: sulfation, desulfation, and simulated DPF regeneration. A maximum mid-bed catalyst temperature of (770 r 10) ÂºC was observed during desulfation due to the exotherm resulting from the fast lean-rich cycling. Depending on actual fuel sulfur levels, one aging cycle is estimated to be equivalent to 1000â€“1500 miles of road aging. 50 cycles were used for the aging runs, requiring a total aging time of ca. 100 h per sample. At the end of each aging run, a final desulfation was performed under constant rich conditions, corresponding to 2% H 2 in the presence of 5% H 2 O and 5% CO 2 at 750 ÂºC for 10 min, in order to remove as much as the residual sulfur as possible. This was done to ensure that the aged catalysts were not subject to desulfation phenomena during subsequent steady-state NO x reduction tests. 1.4 Temperature ramp experiments Temperature ramp experiments were performed using 2.1 cm diameter u 2.54 cm long catalyst cores operating at a high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV, 120000 h â€“1 ) in order to ensure a fast approach to steady-state. The catalyst was allowed to equilibrate under the gas flow at 125 ÂºC, after which the temperature was ramped to 500 ÂºC at a rate of 5 ÂºC/min. The feed NO or NO 2 concentration in the experiments was fixed at 300 ppm, while the reductant concentration was varied as indicated in the text. CO 2 (5%), H 2 O (5%), and N 2 (as a bal- ance) were also included in the feed. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Catalyst characterization N 2 physisorption data for both fresh and aged catalysts are compared in Table 3. Aging resulted in a decrease in washcoat BET surface area (A BET ) and pore volume, associated with the collapse of some of the smaller pores (reflected in an increase in average pore radius after aging). Relative to the ceria-free catalyst 30-0, 30-100Z displayed a more pronounced decrease in BET surface area, which can be correlated to the more se- vere sintering of the CeO 2 -ZrO 2 phase in 30-100Z relative to the La-stabilized J-Al 2 O 3 support [5]. H 2 pulsed chemisorption results show that aging induced severe sintering of the precious metals (PMs), as evidenced by a significant drop (75%â€“80%) in the overall PM dispersion for both catalysts. As discussed in our previous paper [5], PM sintering is likely to occur both during desulfation (corresponding to a catalyst inlet tempera- ture of 700 ÂºC and mid-bed temperature of 770 ÂºC) and sub- sequent DPF regeneration at 650 ÂºC under continuous lean conditions. In addition to precious metal sintering, the loss of PM surface area for 30-100Z after aging may be due in part to sintering of the CeO 2 -ZrO 2 support, which can result in en- capsulation of the PM [25]. Also of note is the comparison of the OSC measured at 350 ÂºC under cycling conditions (Table 3), which revealed that the addition of CeO 2 -ZrO 2 significantly increased OSC, and that only a slight decrease in OSC occurred as a result of aging. HRTEM studies were also performed on the catalysts. Characterization of 30-0 has been reported in a previous paper [5]. To summarize the findings, in the fresh catalyst Pt particles supported on Al 2 O 3 display a narrow size range, with the ma- jority of particles being ~2 nm in size. Pt on Ba-rich surfaces shows a broader size range from 1 to 4 nm. After aging, the catalyst has a markedly denser surface appearance compared with the fresh material and rather large Pt crystals are observed, some as large as 25 nm. The Al 2 O 3 support hosts only minor amounts of Pt particles that are still in the original 2 nm size range. The majority of Pt occurs within regions that are coated by a BaSO 4 phase, this being the result of sulfur accumulation on the catalyst during aging. Shown in Fig. 1 are TEM images of the fresh and aged 30-100Z catalyst samples. Given that the Pt/BaO/Al 2 O 3 com- ponent in 30-100Z is the same as that in the previously char- acterized 30-0, in the following discussion we focus on the Pt/CeO 2 -ZrO 2 component. As shown in Fig. 1(a), in the fresh catalyst the CeO 2 -ZrO 2 crystals are polyhedral with sharp crystal edges and a size range of typically 10â€“15 nm in di- ameter. The supported Pt is highly dispersed, typical particle sizes ranging from 1.5 to 3 nm. After aging, the CeO 2 -ZrO 2 particles show more rounded edges relative to the fresh state, with the size range shifted to larger grains. This suggests that the CeO 2 -ZrO 2 has undergone some degree of recrystallization. At the same time, the Pt particles range in size from 2 to 7.5 nm, indicative of a decrease in the Pt dispersion, although relatively few Pt particles are observed in the upper end of the Table 3 Physical properties of fresh and aged catalysts Catalyst Washcoat BET SA (m 2 /g) Pore volume (cm 3 /g) Average pore radius (nm) PM dispersion (%) OSC (mmol/L) 30-0 (fresh) 121 0.148 6.82 34.0 21.5 30-0 (aged) 107 0.137 7.23 8.5 19.4 30-100Z (fresh) 140 0.176 6.44 45.5 73.2 30-100Z (aged) 74 0.119 8.42 9.2 69.5 Jin WANG et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 736â€“745 size range. The Pt nanoparticles tend to exhibit a hexagonal morphology, especially in the larger sized particles. Compared to Pt located on the Ba/Al 2 O 3 phase in aged 30-0, Pt supported on the CeO 2 -ZrO 2 host in 30-100Z is more highly dispersed after aging, which can be attributed to the ability of ceria-containing supports to stabilize small Pt particles via strong Pt-O-Ce interactions [5,18]. Of particular note is the fact that no sulfur was detected by EDS when areas of the Pt/CeO 2 -ZrO 2 phase in the aged 30-100Z catalyst were analyzed. A series of EDS analyses was performed on 20 different CeO 2 -ZrO 2 particles, in which a beam window was selected so as to include the entire grain surface. In no cases was sulfur detected, an example being shown in Fig. 2(a), with a close-up in Fig. 2(b). Figure 2(c) shows a high resolution STEM image of a CeO 2 -ZrO 2 particle that supports a Pt particle on its surface. Sulfur analysis was performed along a trace-line (the red line in Fig. 2(c)) that stretched across the CeO 2 -ZrO 2 particle (avoiding the Pt parti- cle). As shown in Fig. 2(d), no sulfur was detected along the line. These results contrast with results obtained for the Pt/BaO/Al 2 O 3 component in samples 30-0 and 30-100Z. Spe- cifically, as detailed previously for 30-0 [5], STEM/EDS analyses reveal the presence of S associated with the Ba phase, while XPS data confirmed that the sulfur was present as sul- fate. Indeed, for 30-0, the S/Ba atomic ratio measured by XPS was 0.452, the bulk ratio according to elemental analysis being 0.342. 2.2 NO x reduction with H 2 Figure 3 shows the results of steady-state NO reduction by H 2 over the four catalysts at NO:H 2 ratios of 1:1 and 1:2.5. From the data it is apparent that NO reduction lights off at very low temperatures (< 100 Â°C) over the catalysts and that the NO conversion at low temperatures is improved by increasing the H 2 concentration in the feed. Comparing the catalysts, 30-0 is Pt Fig. 1. HRTEM analysis of fresh (a) and aged (b) 30-100Z catalyst. Arrows indicate the positions of Pt particles. Fig. 2.

At this NO:H 2 ratio the two catalysts show similar be- havior with respect to the selectivity of NO x reduction, sig- nificant NH 3 formation occurring at low temperatures (< 250 Â°C). In agreement with the literature [23,27â€“29], selectivity for NH 3 is highly dependent on the NO:H 2 ratio, NH 3 being the main product across a wide temperature range when a NO:H 2 ratio of 1:2.5 is used. Particularly noteworthy is the finding that the selectivity for NH 3 is increased after catalyst aging; as reported in our previous study [5], this is also the case when NO x reduction is performed under lean-rich cycling conditions. Furthermore, it is evident that at the NO:H 2 ratio of 1:2.5, catalyst 30-0 shows higher selectivity for NH 3 than 30-100Z at most temperatures, both in the fresh state and after aging. It is worth noting that N 2 O formation was also observed over the catalysts at low temperatures (data not shown). At 100 ÂºC the selectivity for N 2 O approached 60% for both fresh and aged 30-0 and 30-100Z at the 1:1 NO:H 2 ratio, although the N 2 O selectivity rapidly decreased with increasing temperature, such that N 2 O formation was insignificant above 175 ÂºC. Changing the NO:H 2 ratio to 1:2.5 resulted in decreased N 2 O formation, N 2 O being a minor product even at 100 ÂºC (~35% selectivity); again, negligible N 2 O formation was observed above 175 ÂºC. At both ratios, selectivity for N 2 O was not significantly af- fected by catalyst aging. Turning to the NO 2 + H 2 reaction, Fig. 4 shows steady-state results at NO 2 :H 2 ratios of 1:2 and 1:3.5. In general, the trends are similar to those observed for the NO + H 2 reaction, al- though the light-off temperature is significantly higher than for the NO + H 2 reaction. As suggested in the literature [23], this may be due to the presence of strongly adsorbed NO 2 on the 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 20 40 60 80 100 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 20 40 60 80 100 N H 3 s e l e c t i v i t y ( % ) N O c o n v e r s i o n ( % ) Temperature ( o C) (a) Fresh 30-0 Aged 30-0 Fresh 30-100Z Aged 30-100Z (b) Temperature ( o C) N O c o n v e r s i o n ( % ) Fresh 30-0 Aged 30-0 Fresh 30-100Z Aged 30-100Z N H 3 s e l e c t i v i t y ( % ) Fig. 3.

Jin WANG et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 736â€“745 precious metal surface sites at low temperatures, thereby pre- venting the dissociative adsorption of H 2 . Similar to the NO + H 2 reaction, NH 3 formation is observed only at low tempera- tures when a stoichiometric amount of H 2 is used for NO 2 reduction, whereas at the higher NO 2 :H 2 ratio of 1:3.5 NH 3 is formed with high selectivity across a wide temperature range. Comparing 30-0 and 30-100Z, it is evident that the activity of 30-0 decreases significantly after aging, whereas 30-100Z is hardly affected. For both catalysts, selectivity for NH 3 is sig- nificantly increased after aging, 30-0 showing slightly higher selectivity for NH 3 than 30-100Z. 2.3 NO x reduction with CO Given that CO is generally the most abundant reductant present in diesel and gasoline exhaust gas, steady-state NO x reduction experiments were conducted with CO. Figure 5 summarizes the results of experiments using NO:CO ratios of 1:1 and 1:2.5. Comparison of these results with those obtained using H 2 (Figs. 3 and 4) reveals that the light-off temperatures for NO conversion are significantly higher for the CO ex- periments, the lowest T 50 value (i.e., the temperature corre- sponding to 50% NO conversion) being around 175 ÂºC for the latter. Furthermore, with the exception of aged 30-0, the light-off temperature increases slightly as the CO concentration in the feed is increased. These observations are indicative of CO poisoning at low temperature. Previously we have reported the results of a DRIFTS study on powder catalysts of the type Pt/BaO/Al 2 O 3 , with and without Pt/CeO 2 added as a physical mixture [30]. For Pt/BaO/Al 2 O 3 alone, DRIFTS spectra con- tained a strong Pt-CO band at temperatures below ca. 250 ÂºC, suggesting that there is indeed a high surface coverage of CO on Pt at these temperatures. However, the band disappeared at a lower temperature (between 200 and 250 ÂºC) when Pt/CeO 2 was present, due to the high WGS activity of the Pt/CeO 2 component. Similarly, the high WGS activity of the Pt/CeO 2 -ZrO 2 component of catalyst 30-100Z explains its lower light-off temperature compared to 30-0. It is also note- worthy that after aging the T 50 value of 30-100Z is virtually unchanged, whereas the T 50 for 30-0 increases significantly. Turning to the selectivity of NO reduction, at the NO:CO ratio of 1:1, N 2 is formed as the main reduction product, al- though some NH 3 formation occurs at low temperatures (< 250 ÂºC). N 2 O formation (data not shown) is negligible. Increasing the NO:CO ratio to 1:2.5 results in the formation of NH 3 as the main product at temperatures below 400 ÂºC (with the exception of aged 30-0), which is to be expected if NO reduction pro- ceeds mainly via H 2 generated from the WGS reaction. Com- paring the fresh and aged catalysts, it is apparent that 30-0 becomes more selective for N 2 formation (less selective for NH 3 ) after aging, whereas 30-100Z becomes less selective for N 2 (more selective for NH 3 ). The latter is expected since it follows the trend for the NO + H 2 reaction, while the increase in selectivity for N 2 observed for 30-0 is presumably the result of a decrease in WGS activity after aging, thereby decreasing the effective concentration of H 2 available for NO reduction. Shown in Fig. 6 are the results of NO 2 reduction with CO. The trends are very similar to the NO + CO reaction, although one difference is the shift of the light-off temperature to lower values when the CO concentration in the feed is increased. This reflects the strong adsorption of NO 2 on the precious metal sites (in contrast to NO); evidently, significant NO 2 adsorption occurs at low temperatures (< 150 ÂºC), even in the presence of excess CO. 2.4 NO x reduction with NH 3 NO x reduction by NH 3 is an important reaction during LNT regeneration. Figure 7 shows steady-state data for the NO + NH 3 reaction (in the absence of O 2 ) over the four catalysts.

Jin WANG et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 736â€“745 light-off temperatures for the fresh catalysts are very similar, T 50 being ~170 ÂºC. However, after aging T 50 increases to 250 ÂºC for 30-0, while the activity of aged 30-100Z shows almost no change from the fresh state. Comparison of the NO and NH 3 conversion curves shows that for each catalyst a substantial fraction of NH 3 remained unconverted at the temperature cor- responding to complete NO conversion. This observation is consistent with a stoichiometry in which NO reduction requires less than 1 equivalent of NH 3 , i.e.: 4 NH 3 + 6 NO Ä— 5 N 2 + 6 H 2 O In the absence of O 2 , consumption of the excess NH 3 at high temperatures must be associated with NH 3 decomposition to N 2 and H 2 . Indeed, in separate experiments (data not shown), the four catalysts were found to show similar activity for catalyz- ing NH 3 decomposition (in the absence of NO and O 2 ) with a T 50 value of ~375 ÂºC. We note that similar findings have been reported by Pihl et al. [23] for a commercial LNT catalyst. It is also worth noting that the selectivity of NO x reduction to N 2 was typically very high (> 95%, data not shown), the exception being at temperatures below 200 Â°C when the selectivity for N 2 O approached 35%. 2.5 Discussion The steady-state reaction of NO with H 2 over precious met- als has been extensively reported in the literature [28]. For a given metal, it is apparent that the activity and selectivity of a given metal is determined by the relative concentrations of N, H, and O on the surface [29,31]. In this study, the strong de- pendence of the selectivity of NO x reduction on the NO x :H 2 ratio was confirmed. It was also found that the light-off tem- perature for the NO 2 + H 2 reaction decreased with increase of the H 2 concentration. Xu et al. [27] reported a similar finding for NO reduction by H 2 over Pt/Al 2 O 3 and Pt-BaO/Al 2 O 3 catalysts, and took this as an indication that the reaction order is positive in H 2 . In the case of the NO + H 2 reaction, comparison of catalyst activity in the low temperature region at the two NO:H 2 ratios is not possible due to the fact that at the 1:1 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 20 40 60 80 100 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 20 40 60 80 100 N O 2 c o n v e r s i o n ( % ) Temperature ( o C) Fresh 30-0 Aged 30-0 Fresh 30-100Z Aged 30-100Z (a) N H 3 s e l e c t i v i t y ( % ) N O 2 c o n v e r s i o n ( % ) Temperature ( o C) Fresh 30-0 Aged 30-0 Fresh 30-100Z Aged 30-100Z (b) N H 3 s e l e c t i v i t y ( % ) Fig. 6.

Jin WANG et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 736â€“745 NO:H 2 ratio the NO conversion is H 2 -limited at low tempera- tures; this is a direct consequence of NH 3 formation, which requires a 1:1.5 NO:H 2 stoichiometry. At these low tempera- tures (< 175 ÂºC) NO conversion via the NO + NH 3 reaction is insignificant (as shown in Fig. 7), hence a certain fraction of the NO remains unconverted. In contrast to NO x reduction by H 2 , an inhibition effect is observed for NO reduction by CO at low temperatures, in- dicative of a negative reaction order in CO. As for NO x reduc- tion by H 2 , the selectivity of both NO and NO 2 reduction by CO was found to be highly dependent on the concentration of CO in the feed. If NO x reduction proceeds to a large degree via H 2 generated in the WGS reaction, then this observation is readily explained since the concentration of H 2 generated in situ is a function of the CO concentration. However, it is also possible that NH 3 is generated via hydrolysis of intermediate isocyanate (â€“NCO) species, as has been proposed by several research groups [32â€“34]. Increasing the ratio of adsorbed CO:N on the precious metal sites should result in more effective trapping of the N ad-atoms by CO and hence increased isocyanate forma- tion. At present, the relative importance of these two pathways for NH 3 formation from CO remains unclear [34]. NH 3 also functions as an efficient reductant for NO under anaerobic conditions. However, comparison of the conversion curves for NO reduction with H 2 and NH 3 reveals that the NO + H 2 reaction lights-off earlier than the NO + NH 3 reaction, H 2 clearly being a more active reductant than NH 3 at temperatures of 200 ÂºC and below. Again, this is consistent with results reported for Pt/BaO/Al 2 O 3 model catalysts [28]. Turning to the effect of catalyst composition, relatively little difference is observed in the activity for NO x reduction exhib- ited by catalysts 30-0 and 30-100Z in the fresh state. As re- ported in our previous study [5], the fresh catalysts also show similar behavior under lean-rich cycling conditions with re- spect to NO x storage efficiency, LNT regeneration (that is, decomposition of nitrates) and reduction of the NO x liberated from nitrate decomposition. However, it was observed that after aging the cycle-averaged NO x conversion efficiency of 30-0 was significantly impaired, whereas the performance of 30-100Z was affected to only a minor degree. The deteriorated performance of 30-0 was found to result from decreased NO x storage efficiency, as well as decreased regeneration efficiency and decreased NO x reduction activity (resulting in increased NO x slip during rich phase regeneration). As shown above, the steady-state data confirm that catalyst aging results in signifi- cant deterioration of the activity of 30-0 for NO x reduction with H 2 , CO, and NH 3 . This decrease in activity can be attributed to the significant PM sintering that resulted from the catalyst aging procedure applied (Table 3). Indeed, as reported in the literature for three-way catalysts [35], decreased NO x reduction activity is typically associated with PM sintering. It is generally accepted that the reductant needs to be first adsorbed on the PM before NO x reduction can occur. Given that sintering results in decreased PM surface area and hence a decrease in available sites for NO x dissociation and reductant adsorption, the rate of NO x reduction is expected to decrease. In contrast to 30-0, the NO x reduction activity of catalyst 30-100Z is not significantly deteriorated after aging. As indi- cated above, this agrees with the results of lean-rich cycling experiments performed with 30-100Z [5]. The superior activity of the aged 30-100Z can be attributed to the presence of the Pt/CeO 2 -ZrO 2 phase in the catalyst. As shown by HRTEM observations, Pt supported on CeO 2 -ZrO 2 remains highly dis- persed after aging, in contrast to Pt supported on the BaO/Al 2 O 3 component. In addition, the facile desulfation of the Pt/CeO 2 -ZrO 2 component means that it does not accumulate sulfur during aging (as indicated by TEM-EDS analysis), unlike Pt/BaO/Al 2 O 3 [5]. Consequently, the Pt/CeO 2 -ZrO 2 component in 30-100Z should not be blocked by accumulated sulfate with respect to NO x adsorption on the Pt or CeO 2 -ZrO 2 surface. In this context, it is also worth noting that CeO 2 -ZrO 2 is an active catalyst in its own right for the selective catalytic reaction of NO with NH 3 [36,37]. The most unexpected finding from the steady-state experi- ments is that selectivity for NH 3 in the NO/NO 2 +H 2 reactions increases after catalyst aging. In principle, this could be due to the fact that once NH 3 is formed, it can undergo subsequent reactions with unreacted NO x in the feed or can undergo de- composition to N 2 and H 2 . Hence, a relative decrease in the rates of the NO/NO 2 +NH 3 or NH 3 decomposition reactions relative to the NO/NO 2 +H 2 reaction might explain the in- creased selectivity for NH 3 . However, comparison of the data in Figs. 3 and 7 reveals a significant increase in NH 3 selectivity at 150 ÂºC after aging, which is below the light-off temperature for the NO + NH 3 reaction over both the fresh and aged cata- lysts. In other words, the NO + NH 3 reaction does not affect the overall selectivity of NO x reduction to NH 3 at these low tem- peratures. Furthermore, data for fresh and aged 30-0 and 30-100Z show that NH 3 decomposition is negligible below 250 ÂºC and that catalyst activity for the decomposition reaction does not change appreciably after aging (data not shown). Hence, this potential explanation can also be excluded. Based on the foregoing we conclude that the increased se- lectivity for NH 3 after catalyst aging must be due to an increase in the intrinsic selectivity of the catalyst for NH 3 production. This in turn implies a change in the relative surface coverages of N and H ad-atoms on the PM sites, i.e., increased coverage by H at the expense of N. The reasons for this are unclear, although logically it must be related to the PM dispersion. One possible implication is that as the PM particles become larger, and hence more metallic in character, dissociative adsorption of NO x decreases, while H 2 dissociation is affected to a lesser degree. While there have been many studies of NO reduction by H 2 and CO on metal surfaces, the effect of metal dispersion on product selectivity does not appear to have been addressed. However, Pirug and Bonzel [38] have reported that product Jin WANG et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 736â€“745 distribution as a function of temperature in the NO + H 2 reac- tion shows a striking similarity over polycrystalline Pt foil in vacuo and Pt dispersed on Al 2 O 3 at 1 atm total pressure. This tends to rule against the above explanation. Another possible explanation involves the transport of NO x to the PM sites. It is pertinent to mention here that under cy- cling conditions selectivity for NH 3 is generally increased after catalyst aging. As noted previously [5,22], there are a number of possible factors which can account for this increase. One of the principal reasons is believed to be Pt sintering, which re- sults in a decrease in the Pt-Ba interfacial perimeter and hence a decrease in the rate of transport of stored NO x to Pt sites during regeneration. As noted by Clayton et al. [39], if this rate is slower than the H 2 feed rate, then H 2 will break through the catalyst with a substantial amount of NO x remaining on it. Consequently, the Pt surface will be predominantly covered by hydrogen, and as the stored NO x migrates to the Pt particles, NH 3 will be preferentially formed. Recent modeling studies by Bhatia et al. [40] confirm this idea: NH 3 formation is favored when solid-phase diffusion of NO x to the Pt/Ba interface is the rate determining process, which becomes increasingly likely as the Pt dispersion decreases. Somewhat similarly, it can be postulated that if Ë° under steady-state conditions Ë° NO x reduction on Pt proceeds to a significant degree via initial adsorption on the BaO/Al 2 O 3 or CeO 2 -ZrO 2 phases, followed by migration to the PM sites, then sulfation of the Pt/BaO/Al 2 O 3 phase, together with the decreased PM-support interfacial perimeter, will result in decreased NO x adsorption on Ba and a decreased rate of NO x transport from Ba to Pt. This in turn would lead to a higher H:NO x ratio at the PM sites. LNT selectivity for NH 3 is an important issue given the toxic nature of NH 3 . However, it is also possible to take advantage of NH 3 formation by means of so-called â€œhybridâ€� LNT-SCR systems. In this concept, an SCR catalyst is placed downstream of the LNT and is used to trap NH 3 and catalyze its reaction with NO x that slips through the LNT, thereby achieving higher overall NO x conversion levels than is possible with the LNT alone [41]. Understanding the chemistry of NH 3 formation over LNT catalysts is therefore essential to the optimal design and operation of LNT-SCR systems. Steady-state experiments in this study clearly show that in NO x reduction by H 2 and CO, the intrinsic selectivity for NH 3 increases after catalyst aging. This provides an additional explanation for the increased emissions of NH 3 observed for aged LNT catalysts during cyclic LNT operation [5], and holds implications for the operation of LNT-SCR systems. The fact that an unambiguous explanation for this phenomenon is currently lacking indicates a need for further study. 3 Conclusions The addition of CeO 2 -ZrO 2 to a fully formulated Ba-based LNT catalyst was found to exert little effect on steady-state NO x reduction activity in the fresh state. However, after aging, NO x reduction activity with H 2 , CO, and NH 3 was significantly impaired for the CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -free catalyst, whereas the per- formance of its CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -containing analog was affected to only a minor degree. These differences are explained on the basis of HRTEM measurements which show that Pt supported on CeO 2 -ZrO 2 remained highly dispersed after aging, in con- trast to Pt supported on the BaO/Al 2 O 3 component. In addition, it was found that Pt/CeO 2 -ZrO 2 did not accumulate sulfur during aging, unlike the Pt/BaO/Al 2 O 3 component for which significant sulfation of the Ba phase was observed. For both catalysts, selectivity for NH 3 in NO and NO 2 reduction by H 2 increased after catalyst aging. This is suggestive of a change in the relative surface coverages of N and H ad-atoms on the precious metal sites, i.e., increased coverage by H at the ex- pense of N.

RESEARCH PAPER NO x Reduction on Fully Formulated Lean NO x Trap Catalysts Subjected to Simulated Road Aging: Insights from Steady-State Experiments Jin WANG Yaying JI Uschi GRAHAM Caio CESAR SPINDOLA DE OLIVEIRA Mark CROCKER * Center for Applied Energy Research, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40511, USA * Corresponding author. Tel: +1-859-257-0295; Fax: +1-859-257-0302 Fully formulated lean NO x trap (LNT) catalysts of the type Pt/Rh/BaO/Al2O3 were prepared with and without incorporation of CeO2-ZrO2 in the washcoat, and their NO x reduction behavior was evaluated in steady-state, continuous flow experiments. In the fresh state, CeO2-ZrO2 addition was found to exert little effect on NO x reduction activity using H2, CO, and NH3 as the reductants. However, after simulated road aging, NO x reduction activity was significantly impaired for the CeO2-ZrO2-free catalyst, whereas the performance of the CeO2-ZrO2-containing analog was affected to only a minor degree. These differences are explained on the basis of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy measurements showing that Pt supported on CeO2-ZrO2 remained highly dispersed after aging, whereas Pt supported on BaO/Al2O3 underwent significant sintering. In addition, the Pt/CeO2-ZrO2 component did not accumulate sulfur during aging, unlike Pt/BaO/Al2O3 for which significant sulfation of the Ba phase occurred. For both catalysts, selectivity to NH3 in NO and NO2 reduction by H2 increased after catalyst aging, indicative of a change in the relative surface coverages of N and H ad-atoms on the precious metal sites. Graphical abstract The addition of CeO2-ZrO2 to a Pt/Rh/BaO/Al2O3 lean NO x trap catalyst affords significant benefits with respect to steady-state NO x reduction activity after catalyst aging. These benefits are explained on the basis of HRTEM analyses.
