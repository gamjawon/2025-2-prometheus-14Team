Catalytic oxidation of nitric oxide (NO) is a critical step for solving diesel engine exhaust issues. Owing to low cost and high thermal stability, mullite‐type oxides (e.g., SmMn2O5) are an efficient substitute for the commercial platinum-group-metal (PGM) catalysts. Here, a series of Sm1−xSrxMn2O5 catalysts were precisely synthesized by the sol-gel method. By introducing strontium (Sr) species, the NO oxidation activity improved significantly, and the optimum performance was achieved over Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 catalyst (92 % conversion at 270 °C). The XRD, TEM and XPS results show the formation of a mixed-phase oxide and the interfacial structure between the SmMn2O5 mullite and SrMnO3 perovskite in the Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 sample. Compared with pure SmMn2O5 and SrMnO3, the Sr substitution improves the specific surface area and amounts of surface adsorbed oxygen species and surface Mn active sites. The rich oxygen vacancies were also determined by the EPR, XPS and O2-TPD technique, which also strengthen the NO adsorption. It reveals that all these factors benefit higher NO catalytic oxidation performance. This study provides an economic alternative to catalyze NO oxidation reactions in diesel oxidation catalysis.

However, excessive O2 content in exhaust emission makes the removal of nitrogen oxides (NOx) much more difficult. To reduce the engine-generated NOx pollutants, DOC (diesel oxidation catalyst) is installed before DPF (diesel particulate filters) and SCR (selective catalytic reduction) converters, in which part of NO can be oxidized to NO2. Because NO2 possesses higher oxidation than O2, it could promote the oxidations of hydrocarbon species in DOC, soot in DPF, and even the NO reduction efficiency in SCR via the fast-SCR reaction (NO2 + NO + 2NH3 → 3H2O + 2N2) in the range of 200–300 °C [4–6]. Given that NO is the main NOx in diesel engine exhaust, NO oxidation (NO-to-NO2) is a key step in minimizing NO and soot pollutants in diesel exhausts. To date, various catalysts, such as platinum-group-metal (PGM), transition metal oxides (TMOs) and carbon-based materials have been developed for NO oxidation [4,6–10]. Although Pt-based catalysts have been commercially applied for NO oxidation, it also suffers from high cost and poor thermal durability issues. The TMOs have the excellent ability to NO oxidation, but the change of surface phase is unavoidable during the catalytic oxidation process. More recently, mullite-type oxides (e.g., SmMn2O5) were discovered and applied to NO oxidation, which showed high thermal durability and excellent activity as candidates for commercial Pt-based catalysts [4,11]. Consequently, the development of mullite-type oxides in NO oxidation has become an important research hotspot in diesel oxidation catalysis. In this case, SmMn2O5 nanostructures with different morphologies and particle sizes were well regulated to improve the NO oxidation activity. [12,13] It is well accepted that doping heteroatoms in metal oxides are one of the effective ways to improve catalytic activity. Shan et al. [14]. reported that the La addition into SmMn2O5 mullite catalyst resulted in the formation of the multiphase oxide. They revealed that different La/Sm molar ratios were crucial for surface adsorbed oxygen and the chemical state of Mn, promoting NO oxidation. Mn-rich perovskite with high Mn4+ species also produced more active oxygen [3]. Additionally, the Sr addition has been demonstrated with superior performance. Kim et al. [4] reported the Sr-doped LaCoO3 perovskite catalyst for NO oxidation, which possessed superior performance than Pt-based commercial diesel oxidation catalyst. The addition of Sr greatly increased the amount of weakly bonded oxygen adsorbed in oxygen vacancies in LaCoO3, which was active for the oxidation reaction [15,16]. As for the reported Mn7CeSmSrO14.83 catalyst in NO oxidation, the doping of Sr facilitated an increase in the surface area with more active sites. Unfortunately, an excess of Sr leaded to poor NO conversion due to the possible formation of Sr-based perovskite oxides. [11] Bear this in mind, we believe that the regulation of Sr-doping amounts is vital, and the mixed-phase oxides with unique interfaces might also create the specific performance. Herein, Sr was introduced into SmMn2O5 mullite catalyst for NO oxidation and the Sr/Sm molar ratios were precisely tuned. The SrMnO3 perovskite was in-situ generated, forming the special interface on SmMn2O5 mullite. Simultaneously, physicochemical properties, such as surface components, specific surface area and redox properties, were also changed along with the addition of Sr species. The optimum catalyst exhibits superior performance, which is more than the reported Pt-based catalyst. Exhaustive characterizations were associated with catalytic performance, and the structure-activity relationship was established. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Preparation of the catalysts A series of Sm1−xSrxMn2O5 catalysts were prepared by the traditional citric acid sol-gel method. Typically, a certain amounts of Sm(NO3)3•6H2O, Sr(NO3)2 and Mn(NO3)3•9H2O were dissolved in deionized water. The molar ratio of Sm: Sr: Mn is 1-x: x: 2, and the citric acid in 100 % molar of the total cations (Sm + Sr + Mn) was added to the aqueous solution later. After evaporating and drying, the products were calcined in the muffle furnace at 500 and 800 °C for 8 h, respectively. The detailed preparation process was placed in Supporting Materials (SM). 2.2 Catalysts characterization The phase structural, morphology and surface properties were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and O2 temperature programmed desorption (O2-TPD) and NO-TPD. The characterization details were placed in the SM. 2.3 Catalyst testing The NO catalytic oxidation activity was evaluated in a fixed-bed microreactor (Ф = 10.0 mm) filled with 0.10 g catalyst (40–60 mesh). The volumetric composition (500 ppm NO + 10 % O2 + balance N2) of the reaction gas mixture was introduced into the microreactor at a total flow rate of 200 mL min-1. The detailed catalytic evaluation process was placed in the SM. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Crystal phase structure and catalytic activity The crystal phase structures of Sm1−xSrxMn2O5 with varied Sm/Sr ratio and SrMnO3 perovskite were measured by the XRD technique, which was presented in Fig. 1 a. It shows that the mullite-type oxide (SmMn2O5) or perovskite oxides (SrMnO3) were synthesized by a single Sm or Sr precursors. The orthorhombic SmMn2O5 phase (PDF#52–1096) and SrMnO3 perovskite phases (JPCDS PDF#25–0902) were confirmed in the light of standard PDF card. After introducing Sr precursor into mullite, the SrMnO3 with perovskite phase appeared, the corresponding intensities of diffraction peaks increased with a rise of Sr/Sm ratio. In this study, the serial Sm1−xSrxMn2O5 (x = 0, 0.2 and 0.4) samples were designed. This result fulfills our envisage, that the mixed-phase oxide catalyst has SrMnO3 perovskite and SmMn2O5 mullite structure with a unique interface. In addition, the unit cells of the crystal structure of SmMn2O5 and SrMnO3 samples were shown in Fig. 1 b and c, respectively. The orthorhombic SmMn2O5 has a Pbam space group, consisting of edge-sharing Mn3+O5 pyramidal and Mn4+O6 octahedral units [17]. While the hexagonal SrMnO3 has a P63/mmc space group, compositing of Mn3+ ions in the MnO6 pairs of face-sharing octahedra structure [18]. The mixed-phase oxide catalyst with a unique interface might contributed to superior catalytic performance. NO oxidation activates of a serial Sm1−xSrxMn2O5, SrMnO3, and Pt-based catalysts were presented in Fig. 2 a. Apparently, the NO conversion increased with increasing temperatures within the kinetically limited regime, and achieved a maximum as the equilibrium limit was reached, then decreased as a function of reaction temperature. Among these catalysts, single SmMn2O5 and SrMnO3 samples show poor NO oxidation performance. Especially, the SrMnO3 sample exhibits the lowest NO conversion (ca. 30 % at 400 °C). Nevertheless, the introduction of Sr into SmMn2O5 can significantly improve NO oxidation activity. The Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 sample is composed of SrMnO3 perovskite and SmMn2O5 mullite, and exhibits the optimum performance with a maximum NO conversion of 92 % at 270 °C. At the same time, the NO conversion remained above 80 % in the temperature range of 235 °C and 325 °C. The Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 sample outperformed the reported Pt-based catalyst, i.e. 2 wt% Pt/Al2O3, which exhibited a maximum NO conversion of 60 % at 330 °C [11]. Meanwhile, the catalytic performance of Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 catalyst is superior to the platinum catalyst we prepared. As confirmed by XRD profiles, the mixed-phase oxides SrMnO3/SmMn2O5 formed by the Sr substitution. The doping of Sr forms SrMnO3 and SmMn2O5 mixed-phase oxides, increasing the catalyst's specific surface area and exposing more active sites. Considering the effect of specific surface area on catalytic performance, the normalized reaction rates for typical catalysts were calculated and presented in Fig. 2 b. The Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 sample has the highest rate with a value of 7.23 × 10–2 mol•m-2s-1 than the Sm0.8Sr0.2Mn2O5 (5.76 × 10–2 mol•m-2s-1) and SmMn2O5 (3.12 × 10–2 mol•m-2s-1), implying the large specific surface area was not the sole cause for enhanced NO catalytic activity. The specific interface structure, more surface oxygen vacancies and rich Mn species were contributed to higher NO oxidation performance. To satisfy the industrial application, the thermal stability and resistance to H2O (5 ± 1 %) over the optimum catalyst were evaluated (Fig. 2 c). The catalysts were subjected to a reaction atmosphere at 300 °C for 50 h for stability testing. The initial NO conversion was ca.88 %, and decreased to 82 % within 5 h. Under the subsequent reaction condition, the NO conversion rate remained unchanged. After introducing water (5 ± 1 %) into the reaction system, the conversion of NO decreased from 81 % to 72 % and then became stable again. Once the water was removed, the NO conversion quickly recovered to 81 % and remained stable. The results revealed that Sm0.8Sr0.2Mn2O5 possessed an excellent water resistance and the effect of water was completely reversible during the 50 h stability test. 3.2 Surface area, morphology and chemical state Based on the XRD results and NO oxidation activities, SmMn2O5, Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 (SrMnO3/SmMn2O5) and SrMnO3 as representative catalysts were selected for a comprehensive comparative study in this work. The N2 sorption results of representative samples were listed in Table 1 . The Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 possesses a larger specific surface area (22.73 m2 g-1) than SmMn2O5 mullite (11.39 m2 g-1) or SrMnO3 perovskite (2.21 m2 g-1), indicating that the doping of Sr can increase the specific surface area and provide more accessible active sites. However, Onrubia et al. [16]. also proved that Sr substitution of LaMn(Co)O3 perovskites could effectively increase the surface area, but excessive doping also caused a decrease of surface area. This phenomenon might be linked with the phase segregations, confirmed by XRD results, that blocked the access to the pores. [19] Besides, the ionic radius of Sr is smaller than that of Sm. After doping with Sr, the lattice parameter was reduced, resulting in small particles and enhanced surface area. TEM technique was employed to clarify the morphology and interface of the Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 sample. In Fig. 3 (a, b), the porous structure is composed of numerous nanoparticles interconnected due to high temperature sintering. Well-crystallized mullite-type SmMn2O5 is identified with the lattice plane of (220) and spacing of 0.281 nm. The perovskite-type SrMnO3 neighboring mullite-type SmMn2O5 is observed with the lattice plane of (110) and spacing of 0.272 nm. This finding is consistent with the XRD analyses. Notably, the partial amorphous zones adjacent to the mullite are also observed. It was reported that the Mn-Mn dimers at the interface were responsible for activating oxygen molecules [11]. To further confirm the conclusion obtained by XRD and TEM results, the TEM-EDS elements mapping was tested to investigate the surface element distributions and composition of Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 sample. As shown in Fig. 3, the elements (Mn, Sm and O) are located uniformly on the catalyst's surface, and the element Sr emerges a state of aggregation. This result might be attributed to phase segregation, and Sr escapes from the crystal lattice of SmMn2O5, forming the SrMnO3 perovskite phase. In accordance with the XRD analysis, the SrMnO3 phase would segregate with a rise of Sr doping contents in mullite. XPS was performed to detect the catalyst surface element compositions and chemical states. The XPS spectra of SmMn2O5 and Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 samples were displayed in Fig. 4 . As a contrast, the XPS spectra of Sr or Sm in SrMnO3, SmMn2O5 and Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 were listed in Fig. S1. The surface elemental compositions and fitted results (Oads/Olatt) were also summarized in Table 1. The doping of Sr promotes the enrichment of Mn on the catalyst surface. Fig. 4 a displays the survey spectra with Sm, Sr, Mn and O signals in the range of 200–1200 eV. We also note that the binding energy of Sm 4p appeared at ca. 250 eV, which is neighboring to the Sr 3p. Compared with the peak intensity of Mn and Sm in SmMn2O5, the Mn 2p peaks in Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 are stronger and the Sm 3d peaks are weaker. It can be concluded that the Mn content in Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 is higher than that in the SmMn2O5 surface, and the Sm content on the Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 surface is lower. Table 1 summarizes the surface elemental compositions from XPS results of SmMn2O5, Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 and SrMnO3 samples. The surface Mn/(Sm + Sr) ratios of the SmMn2O5 and SrMnO3 are 1.13 and 0.88, respectively, while the Mn/(Sm + Sr) ratio of the Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 is 1.91, indicating that the element Mn segregation occurs on the surface. These results indicate that the SrMnO3 and SmMn2O5 mixed-phase oxides in Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 are more likely to expose the Mn active sites than the pure SmMn2O5 and SrMnO3. XPS spectra of Mn 3 s were showed in Fig. 4 b. There exhibits a slight difference between SmMn2O5 and Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5. It was reported that the binding energy difference (ΔEs) was closely related with the average oxidation state (AOS) of manganese (AOS = 8.956−1.126ΔEs), [20,21] and the lower AOS value implied the higher concentration of oxygen vacancies. Based on this result, they have similar surface oxygen vacancies. Furtherly, the XPS spectra of Mn 2p were fitted (Fig. 4 c). Compared with the SmMn2O5 (642.0 eV), the binding energy of Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 shifted into lower biding energy (641.8 eV). This phenomenon should be ascribed to the co-existence of Mn3+ and Mn4+ oxidation states in SmMn2O5 mullite, while the Mn is Mn3+ oxidation states in SrMnO3. Thus, the Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 possesses more surface Mn3+ than SmMn2O5. And the surface-rich Mn3+ is closely related to oxygen vacancies due to the charge balance [22]. According to the fitted result, the surface Mn4+/Mn3+ ratio in SmMn2O5 (0.63) is slightly higher than that in Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 (0.55). Taking the surface concentration of Mn species into account, the Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 has more surface Mn4+ species. the surface Mn4+ is very important for NO oxidation reaction. The O 1 s spectra were fitted into three peaks (Fig. 4 d), and the relative peaks corresponded to the lattice oxygen (Olatt), surface adsorbed oxygen species (Oads) and molecular water [23]. It is well known that oxygen molecules are more likely to adsorb on surface oxygen vacancies and further dissociate into surface adsorbed oxygen species [24,25]. Therefore, the higher Oads reflects a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface. In Table 1, the surface Oads/Olatt ratios for SrMnO3, Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 and SmMn2O5 are 0.43, 0.53 and 0.44, respectively. Obviously, the Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 sample possesses the most Oads species, indicating that it has the highest density of oxygen vacancies. More oxygen vacancies can participate into the gas oxygen activation and NO oxidation. For the characterization of oxygen vacancy, the later EPR results and O2-TPD results could confirm further. 3.3 Redox properties and oxygen desorption capability H2-TPR was tested to investigate redox properties and the profiles for all samples were shown in Fig. 5 A. Two consecutive reduction peaks (415 °C and 506 °C) are observed for the SmMn2O5 sample, and the peak at 415 °C corresponds to the reduction of Mn4+ to Mn3+ and the removal of surface-adsorbed oxygen, while the peak at 506 °C is correlated to the reduction of Mn3+ to Mn2+. [16,26] The high-temperature peak located at around 800 °C was due to the transformation of Mn2+ to Mn0 in the framework of perovskite [27]. With a rise of Sr substitution, the main reduction peaks shift to low temperature, indicative of the fast oxygen mobility. However, an excessive amount of Sr does not promote the low temperature reduction due to the formation of Sr-based perovskite. Note that a weak reduction peak appears below 200 °C, which should be attributed to the reduction of surface oxygen species (O2 − or O −) adsorbed on oxygen vacancies [28]. Furtherly, this part was enlarged in Fig. 5 B. Clearly, the addition of Sr increased the concentration of surface oxygen vacancies of SmMn2O5 with large surface adsorbed oxygen species. And the Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 has the largest amount of surface oxygen vacancies. These are the most weakly bound and surface active oxygen species in the catalysts, benefiting the NO oxidation [14]. This is following the XPS finding, that the Sr substitution generates more surface adsorbed oxygen species [16]. O2-TPD technique is tested to study their desorption behaviors and the type of oxygen species. Generally, the O2 desorption peaks below 200 °C, 200 °C - 500 °C and above 500 °C correspond to the surface adsorbed oxygen, surface lattice oxygen and bulk lattice oxygen, respectively [23] [29]. Seen from Fig. 5 C, compared with the single SmMn2O5 and SrMnO3, Sr-doped mullites have more surface-active oxygen species (adsorbed and lattice oxygen). And the Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 has more surface-active adsorbed oxygen species than that SmMn2O5, indicating that more oxygen species can participate in gas oxygen activation with surface oxygen vacancies, and NO oxidation with surface lattice oxygen species. This result is also consistent with the XPS results, that is, more surface-active oxygen species are the key factors promoting the NO oxidation activity. NO-TPD was performed to investigate NO adsorption/desorption properties on the catalyst's surface. As shown in Fig. 6 a, two obvious desorption peaks are observed for both contrast samples. Apparently, the Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 has more amounts of NO desorption in comparison with the SmMn2O5 at the first desorption peak (170 °C), corresponding to the desorption of bridging nitrites formed by Mn4+-Oβ site interaction [30]. The desorption peak temperature at this point was used to indicate the strength of the NO adsorption capacity. [31,32] It indicates that more NO species were adsorbed due to the accelerated cycling caused by interfacial oxygen, a result consistent with the O2-TPD desorption peak temperature pattern. The other NO desorption peak for SmMn2O5 and Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 samples appears at high temperature (250–500 °C). This NO desorption behavior could be assigned to the decomposition of nitrates or nitrite intermediates on the surface. [33,34] The surface lattice oxygen could react with NO molecules to form nitrites or nitrates, which were stored on the catalyst surface, only a small fraction oxidizes NO directly to NO2, and most of it is desorbed as NO. By contrast, the NO desorption peak for Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 shifts to higher temperature, implying the strong interaction between nitrite intermediates and rich oxygen vacancies. As a conclusion, the surface adsorbed oxygen can stabilize the key intermediate rotational desorption, whereas NO oxidation is the conversion of NO to NO2 by surface lattice oxygen species. The EPR signals for SmMn2O5 and Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 catalysts have been performed at 77 K, and the results were presented in Fig. ( 6b and S2). The full EPR spectrum between 1000∼5000 G was shown in Fig. S2. No characteristic signals for Mn4+ are observed at low magnetic field (e.g., 1500∼2100 G) [35]. There only exist six characteristic fine structures for EPR signals between 3000 and 4000 G (Fig. 6 b). Singh et al. [36] reported that the EPR signal of Mn2+ ion appeared at around g = 2.0 in case of cubic symmetry, which was further split into six hyperfine lines due to interaction of the unpaired electron with 55Mn (nucleus spin value I = 5/2). Therefore, the apparent six hyperfine lines should be ascribed to the characteristic signals for Mn2+. Clearly, more Mn2+species appear on Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 than that on SmMn2O5 catalyst. Notably, we also note the special signals at around 3500 G, which should be ascribed to the formation of oxygen vacancies in both catalysts [37]. The results illustrate that the peak strength (g = 2.003) of Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 was much higher than that of SmMn2O5. It indicates that the addition of Sr can produce a large amount of oxygen vacancies on the SmMn2O5, which can greatly improve the ability of oxygen adsorption and activation. This result is consistent with the analyses of XPS and O2-TPD. According to the above characterizations, such as XPS, TPR, O2-TPD and EPR, it is assumed that the rich oxygen vacancies on the Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 play an important role in improved NO catalytic oxidation activity through the gas oxygen activation. Differently, the EPR measurement reflects the information of bulk oxygen vacancies, while XPS result gives the information of surface oxygen vacancy. The former can boost the mobility of lattice oxygen species via Mars−van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, and the latter can boost the gas oxygen activation via Eley−Rideal (ER) mechanism. [38–40] For the ER mechanism[34], a dissociative adsorption step first takes place where oxygen molecules were adsorbed on adjacent Mn−Mn dimers as *O, forming the Mn-based monodentate nitrite intermediate, further transforming to Mn-bidentate nitrate and Mn-monodentate nitrate. Whereas for MvK mechanism, NO molecules were directly adsorbed on a surface lattice oxygen to form Mn-based monodentate nitrite. The NO2 desorption later created a bridging oxygen vacancy, which was refilled by oxygen molecules. As a conclusion, both MvK and ER mechanisms take effect in NO oxidation for Sr-doped mullites catalysts. 4 Conclusions The serial Sm1−xSrxMn2O5 catalysts with different Sr contents were precisely synthesized by the citric acid sol-gel method and applied to NO oxidation reaction. After introducing Sr species, the composite oxides (SmMn2O5 mullite and SrMnO3 perovskite) with the special interface were formed. The Sr addition significantly improved NO oxidation activity, and the optimum performance was achieved over Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 catalyst (92 % conversion at 270 °C). The Sr addition improves the specific surface area and amounts of surface adsorbed oxygen species, surface Mn active sites and redox properties. The enhanced performance should be attributed to rich oxygen vacancies and surface Mn active sites, which strengthen the NO adsorption and promote the activation/recycling of oxygen species for NO oxidation.

        "dc:description": "Catalytic oxidation of nitric oxide (NO) is a critical step for solving diesel engine exhaust issues. Owing to low cost and high thermal stability, mullite‐type oxides (e.g., SmMn2O5) are an efficient substitute for the commercial platinum-group-metal (PGM) catalysts. Here, a series of Sm1−xSrxMn2O5 catalysts were precisely synthesized by the sol-gel method. By introducing strontium (Sr) species, the NO oxidation activity improved significantly, and the optimum performance was achieved over Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 catalyst (92 % conversion at 270 °C). The XRD, TEM and XPS results show the formation of a mixed-phase oxide and the interfacial structure between the SmMn2O5 mullite and SrMnO3 perovskite in the Sm0.6Sr0.4Mn2O5 sample. Compared with pure SmMn2O5 and SrMnO3, the Sr substitution improves the specific surface area and amounts of surface adsorbed oxygen species and surface Mn active sites. The rich oxygen vacancies were also determined by the EPR, XPS and O2-TPD technique, which also strengthen the NO adsorption. It reveals that all these factors benefit higher NO catalytic oxidation performance. This study provides an economic alternative to catalyze NO oxidation reactions in diesel oxidation catalysis.",
