DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(08)60136-9 Reaction Coupling of Methane Steam Reforming and Methane Dehydroaromatization for Improving Durability of Mo/MCM-49 Catalyst YAO Songdong, SUN Changyong, LI Juan, GU Lijun, SHEN Wenjie* State Key Laboratory of Catalysis, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian 116023, China Abstract: The durability of methane dehydroaromatization (MDA) has been improved by its combination with methane steam reforming (MSR). The methane conversion in the combined MSR/MDA system decreases very slowly from 11.5% at 12.5 h to 6.5% at 60 h, whereas it decreases rapidly from 14.5% at 0.5 h to 3.5% at 15 h for the MDA reaction alone. CO and H 2 produced in-situ through the MSR reaction may reduce the amount of CH x species during the reaction, which in turn reduces the formation of coke deposited on the catalyst, prolonging the durability of the MDA reaction. High content of H 2 from the MSR process plays a major role in suppressing coke accumulation on the catalyst, especially the coke associated with the Brönsted acidic sites that are mainly responsible for the deactivation. Key words: methane dehydroaromatization; methane stream reforming; reaction coupling; molybdenum; MCM-49; coke deposition Methane dehydroaromatization to aromatics (MDA) over Mo-zeolite catalysts has received considerable attention for the effective utilization of natural gas [1–4]. The MDA reac- tion usually follows a bi-functional mechanism. MoO x C y spe- cies, which are formed through the reaction of MoO x species with CH 4 during the induction period, are responsible for the activation of CH 4 and the formation of C 2 species, while the Brönsted acid sites of the zeolites promote the oligomerization of C 2 species to form aromatics [2,5]. However, rapid deacti- vation occurs because of the heavy deposition of coke on the catalyst surface, which is closely associated with the Brönsted acid sites of the zeolites [2]. Therefore, acid and alkali treat- ment [6,7], external surface silanation [8], steam treatment [9–11], hydrothermal treatment [12], and NH 4 F treatment [13] were used to modify the acidic properties of the zeolites in order to suppress coke deposition on Mo-zeolite catalysts. Meanwhile, small amounts of O 2 , CO, H 2 , CO 2 , and H 2 O added to the methane feed were also found to be effective for removing deposited coke and improving the stability of the MDA reaction. A trace amount of O 2 in the methane feed can partially oxidize the coke species, promoting the durability of the Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst [14,15]. A small amount of CO added to the methane feed dissociates on the catalyst surface, forming active oxygen species that can oxidize surface coke [16,17]. H 2 addition to the methane feed inhibits the formation of heavy hydrocarbons and aromatics thermodynamically and thus decreases the deposition of coke on the catalyst [18,19]. CO 2 added to the methane feed reacts with the CH x species, a possible coke precursor, and thus eliminates the deposition of coke [17,18,20,21]. Small amounts of H 2 O added to the methane feed also react with the CH x species, producing CO and H 2 , which in turn suppress the coke formation [21,22]. We have recently reported that the combination of oxida- tive coupling of methane (OCM) with MDA can promote the catalyst stability significantly [23]. The carbon deposited on the Mo/MCM-49 catalyst was removed by the CO 2 and H 2 O simultaneously generated through the OCM reaction. Quite recently, we further combined methane CO 2 reforming (MDR) with MDA, and the CO and H 2 produced by MDR greatly improve the stability of the Mo/MCM-49 catalyst [24]. No- ticing that methane stream reforming (MSR) also produces CO and H 2 and the H 2 /CO ratio is larger than that of the MDR reaction, we report here the combined MSR/MDA reaction initiated by adding small amounts of H 2 O to the methane feed. YAO Songdong et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(10): 1022–1028 The higher content of H 2 greatly suppresses the deposition of coke and thus improves the durability of the Mo/MCM-49 catalyst for the MDA reaction. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation The 6%Mo/MCM-49 catalyst for MDA and the 18%Mo/ Al 2 O 3 catalyst for MSR were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of MCM-49 (SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 = 12.5) and Al 2 O 3 with proper amounts of aqueous ammonium heptamolybdate solu- tion, as described elsewhere [24]. After drying at 393 K for 12 h, the obtained solids were calcined at 773 K in air for 6 h. 1.2 Catalytic tests The combined MSR/MDA reaction was conducted in a continuous flow fixed-bed quartz reactor under atmospheric pressure. The Mo/Al 2 O 3 catalyst (20–40 mesh, 200 mg) for MSR was put in the upper layer of the reactor, and the Mo/MCM-49 catalyst (20–40 mesh, 200 mg) for MDA was loaded in the lower layer. The catalysts were heated from room temperature (RT) to 1023 K at a rate of 10 K/min under a He flow (5 ml/min). Then, a feed gas mixture containing 87.4% CH 4 , 9.7% N 2 , and 2.9% H 2 O (in volume) was intro- duced into the reactor with methane gas hourly space velocity of 1350 ml/(g·h). The effluent was analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (Varian CP-3800) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The FID was used for the analysis of CH 4 , C 6 H 6 , C 7 H 8 , C 8 H 10 , and C 10 H 8 while the TCD was used for the analysis of H 2 , N 2 , CH 4 , CO, C 2 H 4 , and C 2 H 6 . N 2 in the feed was used as an internal standard for estimating the carbon balance. For comparison, the MSR reaction was tested over the Mo/Al 2 O 3 catalyst with the feed gas mixture of 87.4%CH 4 - 9.7%N 2 -2.9%H 2 O. MDA reactions were also tested over the Mo/MCM-49 catalyst with the feed streams of 90%CH 4 - 10%N 2 and 76.5%–80.1%CH 4 -8.5%–8.9%N 2 -11%–15%H 2 . In all the cases, the gas hourly space velocity of methane was kept at 1350 ml/(g·h). 1.3 Catalyst characterization Thermogravimetry and differential thermal analysis (TG- DTA) were performed on a Perkin-Elmer Pyris Diamond TG/TDA instrument. A 15 mg sample was heated in air (100 ml/min) from 313 to 1173 K at a rate of 10 K/min. N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of the samples were obtained at 77 K using an AUTOSORB-1 instrument (Quan- tachrome, USA). The specific surface area was estimated us- ing the linear portion of the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) model. Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) of the used catalysts was conducted in a U-shaped quartz tubular reactor equipped with an online mass spectrometer (Balzers, QMS 200). A 100 mg sample was heated from RT to 773 K at a rate of 15 K/min in a He flow (30 ml/min) and kept at 773 K for 0.5 h. After cooling to RT, the sample was flushed with a 20%O 2 -80%He mixture (40 ml/min) for 1 h and heated to 1073 K at a rate of 8 K/min. MS intensities of m/e = 44 and 28 were monitored by the mass spectrometer. A fragment of CO 2 , which contributed to the signal of m/e = 28 (CO), was sub- tracted according to the standard weight peaks of the mass spectrometer from the total intensity at m/e = 28 (CO) to get the real amount of CO. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 The combined MSR/MDA reaction Figure 1 shows the conversion of CH 4 , the concentrations of CO and H 2 , and the formation rate of coke of the MSR reaction on the Mo/Al 2 O 3 catalyst, where H 2 O was completely converted. The conversion of CH 4 was 20% in the initial stage mainly due to its reaction with the MoO x species in the Mo/Al 2 O 3 catalyst. The formation rate of coke was as high as 12.2 mmol/(g·h), indicating significant carbonization of MoO x 0 5 10 15 20 C onver s i on of CH 4 (%) H 2 CO For m at i on r a t e of coke (mmol / (g � h )) C oncent r at i o n of CO a n d H 2 (% ) 0 10 20 30 (b) (a) 0 102030405060 0 3 6 9 12 (c) Time on stream (h) Fig. 1.

YAO Songdong et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(10): 1022–1028 by CH 4 [5]. At the steady state, the formation rate of coke was 0.36 mmol/(g·h), and the concentrations of CO and H 2 in the outlet stream had stabilized at 2.7% and 11%, respectively. Because the stoichiometric ratio of H 2 /CO produced by the MSR reaction is about 3, the additional H 2 may be caused by the decomposition of CH 4 , which simultaneously produces coke on the surface of the Mo/Al 2 O 3 catalyst. Figure 2 compares the conversion of CH 4 , the yield of aro- matics, and the formation rates of H 2 and coke between the MDA reaction and the combined MSR/MDA system. As we previously reported [24], the MDA reaction exhibits an induc- tion period of 2.5 h, during which the conversion of CH 4 de- creased from 16.5% to 14.5%, while the yield of aromatics increased from 7.0% to 11.6%. This is caused by the reaction of the MoO x species in the catalyst with CH 4 to form the ac- tive MoC 2 or MoO x C y species for the activation of CH 4 and the formation of C 2 species. Thereafter, the conversion of CH 4 and the yield of aromatics decreased rapidly to 3.5% and 1.1%, respectively, at 15 h because of the heavy coke deposi- tion on the catalyst, indicating a severe deactivation. The combined MSR/MDA reaction showed a long induction pe- riod of 12.5 h, during which the conversion of CH 4 decreased from 20% to 12%, while the yield of aromatics gradually in- creased from nearly zero to 5.8%. After that, the conversion of CH 4 and the yield of aromatics decreased very slowly to 6.5% and 2.1%, respectively, at 60 h on stream. Clearly, the durability of the MDA reaction could be significantly im- proved by the combination with the MSR reaction. Figure 3 further shows the conversion of CH 4 and the for- mation rate of coke of the MDA reaction by subtracting the contribution of MSR in the combined system. MDA here had a long induction, during which the conversion of CH 4 in- creased gradually from 0.5% to 7.6%. Then it slowly de- creased to 3.3% at 60 h on stream with selectivity for aromat- ics of 80%–90%. Because of this, the formation rate of coke was only 0.36 mmol/(g·h). This indicates that the coke depo- sition on the Mo/MCM-49 catalyst occurred very slowly. For the typical MDA reaction, the formation rate of coke was about 0.72 mmol/(g·h) at steady state [24]. The smaller coke deposition in the combined system might be ascribed to the presence of CO and H 2 produced by the MSR reaction, which suppresses the formation of coke. Compared with the combined MDR/MDA system where CO and H 2 also promoted the durability of the MDA reaction [24], the MSR/MDA reaction can further decrease the forma- tion rate of coke from 0.54 to 0.36 mmol/(g·h).

YAO Songdong et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(10): 1022–1028 caused by the higher H 2 /CO ratio produced by the MSR reac- tion. The added H 2 O (2.9%) was completely converted and formed a mixture of 2.7% CO and 11% H 2 in the CH 4 stream. In the MDR reaction, 1.41% CO 2 was converted to 2.7% CO and 5.5% H 2 in the CH 4 stream. This fact clearly evidences that the higher concentration of H 2 greatly inhibits the forma- tion of heavy aromatics and reduces the deposition of coke, improving the durability of the MDA catalyst. 2.2 Effect of H 2 addition to the CH 4 feed for MDA Figure 4 shows the effect of H 2 addition to the CH 4 feed on the conversion of CH 4 and the yield of aromatics over the Mo/MCM-49 catalyst. When 11% H 2 was added to the CH 4 feed, the conversion of CH 4 decreased to 12% while the yield of aromatics increased to 8.7% during the induction period. After that, the conversion of CH 4 and the yield of aromatics decreased slowly to 5.3% and 2.9% at 22 h, respectively. When 15% H 2 was added, the conversion of CH 4 decreased slowly from 9.5% at 2.5 h to 4.9% at 35 h, and the corre- sponding yield of aromatics decreased very slowly from 5.9% to 2.6%, showing a better durability of the MDA reaction. Ma et al. [16] have reported a similar effect of H 2 addition (3.6%–9%) to the CH 4 feed gas where the stability of the re- action was significantly increased with increasing H 2 amount, but the formation rate of benzene decreased greatly. When compared with the typical MDA reaction, H 2 addition to the CH 4 feed improves the durability of the catalyst but reduces the formation rate of aromatics. When 2.7% CO was added to the CH 4 feed, the MDA reac- tion exhibited a slow deactivation pattern, in which the yield of aromatics stayed at about 10% within 10 h on stream. For the MDR/MDA reaction with 2.7% CO and 5.5% H 2 in the reaction stream, the yield of aromatics remained at 6%–9% for 14.5 h on stream [24]. For the current MSR/MDA system with the presence of 2.7% CO and 5.5% H 2 in the reaction stream, the yield of aromatics further decreased to 4%–6% but was stabilized for 27.5 h on stream. It seems that H 2 promoted the MDA reaction by inhibiting the decomposition of CH 4 and the formation of aromatics through thermodynamic equilib- rium [15,16]. As a result, a lower amount of poly-aromatics were deposited on the catalyst, especially on the Brönsted acid sites, promoting the stability of the Mo/MCM-49 catalyst. 2.3 Coke deposition on the used Mo/MCM-49 catalyst Table 1 summarizes the TG and TPO results of the used Mo/MCM-49 catalyst for the MDA, H 2 -MDA, and MSR/ MDA reactions. Generally, the coke burning off at high tem- perature (> 800 K) represents poly-aromatic species deposited on the Brönsted acid sites, which are mainly responsible for the deactivation of the catalyst [25,26], while the coke burn- ing off at low temperature (< 800 K) corresponds to carbona- ceous species that are associated with the Mo species. In this study, the coke burning off at ~760 K was associated with the agglomerated Mo 2 C particles covered by graphitic carbon located at the external surface of Mo/MCM-49, whereas the coke burning off at 790 K was associated with the Mo carbide or MoO x C y species in the channel of the zeolite [25–27]. For the MSR/MDA reaction, only 67 mg/g coke was deposited on the surface of Mo/MCM-49, and 31 mg/g coke was associated with Brönsted acid sites. However, about 157 mg/g coke was deposited on the catalyst surface, and the amount of high tem- perature coke was as high as 76 mg/g for the typical MDA reaction. For the H 2 -MDA reaction, the amount of high tem- perature coke was 54 mg/g, lower than that of the MDA reac- tion. Figure 5 shows the amounts of high temperature coke ac- cumulated on the Mo/MCM-49 catalyst with time on stream.

For the MSR/MDA reac- tion, however, the deposition rate constant of high tempera- ture coke was only 0.84 mg/(g·h) owing to the co-promotion of CO (2.7%) and H 2 (11%) produced by the MSR reaction. For the H 2 -MDA reaction, the deposition rate constant of high temperature coke was only 0.60 mg/(g·h). Apparently, H 2 plays an important role in reducing the deposition of high temperature coke. Figure 6 shows TPO profiles of the used Mo/MCM-49 catalyst after CO or H 2 treatment for 2 h. For the sample treated in the 20%CO-80%He stream for 2 h, no significant variation could be found on the high temperature coke, indi- cating that CO influences the coke associated with Brönsted acidic sites slightly. However, the amount of low temperature coke is higher than that of the sample treated with He. CO may form some graphitic coke on the outer layer of the ag- glomerated Mo 2 C particles through the Boudouard reaction (2CO = CO 2 + C). Clearly, CO cannot remove the coke de- posited on the catalyst. However, in the MSR/MDA reaction the deposited coke amount was lower than that of the H 2 -MDA reaction. This is because CO may inhibit the forma- tion of coke by reaction with CH x species, the precursor of the coke [16]. For the sample treated in the 20%H 2 -80%He stream for 2 h, H 2 can significantly remove both the high temperature coke and low temperature coke by hydrogenation, which are asso- ciated with Mo species and Brönsted acidic sites, respectively. Moreover, addition of H 2 to the feed can inhibit the formation of heavy coke through thermodynamic limitation [18]. This promotion effect is becoming more significant with increasing concentration of H 2 in the CH 4 feed [19]. For the MSR/MDA reaction, 11% H 2 was produced by the MSR reaction, which in turn suppresses especially the deposition of coke on the catalyst associated with Brönsted acid sites. Both CO and H 2 can improve the durability of the MDA reaction, but the con- tribution of H 2 seems to be more important because H 2 greatly decreased the high temperature coke formation, which is mainly responsible for the catalyst deactivation in the MDA reaction. Table 2 compares the textural properties of the Mo/ MCM-49 catalyst used for the MDA and the combined MSR/MDA reactions. MCM-49 has two-dimensional sinu- soidal channels (0.4 nm u 0.59 nm) and large supercages (0.71 nm u 0.71 nm u 1.82 nm), which are accessible through 10-ring apertures (0.4 nm u 0.54 nm) [28]. Coke deposits formed during reaction cover the surface of the catalyst or block the channels and cages, leading to a severe deactivation [2]. For the typical MDA reaction, about 60% micropore sur- face area and micropore volume of the Mo/MCM-49 catalyst were covered or occupied by coke after 2 h reaction. More than 90% micropore surface area and 80% micropore volume of the catalyst were covered and blocked by coke after 15 h [24]. For the combined MSR/MDA reaction, the micropore surface area and micropore volume of Mo/MCM-49 were still 244 m 2 /g and 0.114 cm 3 /g, respectively, after 10 h on stream. Apparently, only small amounts of the micropores were cov- ered or blocked owing to the slow coke deposition rate. After 65 h reaction, the micropore surface area and micropore vol- ume of the Mo/MCM-49 catalyst were still 25 m 2 /g and 0.012 cm 3 /g, respectively. This very slow deposition rate of coke is ascribed to the higher content of H 2 produced by the MSR reaction. Compared to the MDR/MDA reaction, the deposition of coke on the Mo/MCM-49 catalyst was further decreased in the MSR/MDA reaction. After reaction for 40 h, the micro- pore surface area and micropore volume of the Mo/MCM-49 catalyst in the MDR/MDA reaction were reduced to 39 m 2 /g and 0.020 cm 3 /g, respectively. The deposition rate of the high temperature coke was 1.4 mg/(g·h), higher than that of the MSR/MDA reaction. This confirms that H 2 is more important in suppressing coke deposition.

YAO Songdong et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(10): 1022–1028 would produce more H 2 (11%) than the MDR reaction (5.5%) [24], the higher concentration of H 2 in the MSR/MDA system would effectively inhibit the blockage of the micropores and suppress the coke accumulation on the catalyst, resulting in a remarkably improved durability of the Mo/MCM-49 catalyst. 3 Conclusions The combined MSR/MDA reaction can significantly pro- mote the durability of the MDA reaction because of the pres- ence of CO (2.7%) and H 2 (11%) formed by the MSR reac- tion. CO forms active O species by dissociation on the surface of the catalyst, which further reacts with CH x species, inhibit- ing coke deposition. H 2 slightly decreases the conversion of CH 4 and the yield of aromatics because of the thermodynamic equilibrium, but it suppresses the formation of poly-aromatics and the deposition of coke on the Mo/MCM-49 catalyst, espe- cially on the Brönsted acid sites, which is largely responsible for the catalyst deactivation during the MDA reaction.

Tel: +86-411-84379085; Fax: +86-411-84694447 The durability of methane dehydroaromatization (MDA) has been improved by its combination with methane steam reforming (MSR). The methane conversion in the combined MSR/MDA system decreases very slowly from 11.5% at 12.5 h to 6.5% at 60 h, whereas it decreases rapidly from 14.5% at 0.5 h to 3.5% at 15 h for the MDA reaction alone. CO and H2 produced in-situ through the MSR reaction may reduce the amount of CH x species during the reaction, which in turn reduces the formation of coke deposited on the catalyst, prolonging the durability of the MDA reaction. High content of H2 from the MSR process plays a major role in suppressing coke accumulation on the catalyst, especially the coke associated with the Brönsted acidic sites that are mainly responsible for the deactivation.
