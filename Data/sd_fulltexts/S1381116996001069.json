Introduction Oxidation is one of the most important reactions for the metabolism of biotic substrates and many enzymes are known to catalyze various types of oxidation. Amongst such oxidizing enzymes, cytochrome P-450 has been most extensively studied, probably due to (i) its diverse presence in body, (ii) its multifold functions: 1381-1169/96/$15.00 Copyright 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

For example, the cytochrome P-450 camphor 5-exohydroxylase (P-450cfrom the soil bacterium pseudomonus putida is available in bulk and its structure has been established by X-ray analysis [1]. Cytochrome P-450 has an ironporphyrin complex as the active site, wherein 88 T.

Catalytic cycle of cytochrome P-450. molecular oxygen is activated as a form of iron-oxo species and then transferred to the substrate. With this oxygen atom transfer reaction (hereafter referred to as oxo transfer reaction), the protein part of P-450 plays a very important role in electron and proton transfer as well as in the recognition of substrates. The general reaction mechanism of the P-450-catalyzed oxo transfer reaction has been disclosed by Groves et al., as shown in Fig. 1 [2]. Furthermore, Groves et al. reported that iron(III)porphyrin complexes could be converted into the corresponding oxo species by treatment with an oxidant such as iodosylbenzene (shunt path, Fig. 1) [3]. This finding suggested that even simple iron(III) porphyrins bearing no protein carrier could be used as model compounds for the active site of cytochrome P-450. Since then, many metalloporphyrin complexes have been synthesized to reproduce the function of cytochrome P-450 in a flask and some well-designed optically active iron(III) and manganese(III) porphyrins have been found to be efficient catalysts for asymmetric epoxidation of simple olefins and oxidation of sulfides [4]. However, their scope is still rather limited [5-11]. On the other hand, metal complexes of [N,N-ethylenebis(salicyldeneaminato)] ligand (salen ligand) also aroused the interest of synthetic chemists as a model compound for the active site of cytochrome P-450, since they have features in common with metalloporphyrins with respect to their electronic structure and catalytic activity. To date, various metallosalen complexes such as (salen)manganese [12], (salen)chromium [13], and (salen)nickel complexes [14] have been synthesized and used for epoxidation of simple olefins but, among others, cationic (salen)manganese complexes are the most efficient as catalysts [12]. catalyst (3.7 rral%), PhlO, CNaCN 0 n ^ V~O I N, ~N_ Mn* OsN C~O~ O ~ ~ NOs PFe 87% These salen-catalyzed epoxidations have also been postulated to proceed through the corresponding oxo metallosalen complexes 1 (Fig. 2). Actually Kochi et al. isolated the cationic oxo (salen)chromium(V) complex (1, M = Cr, X = OTf) and oxochromium(V) adduct with pyridine N-oxide as the axial ligand, and determined their structures unambiguously by X-ray diffraction [13]. The cationic oxochromium(V) complex has a roughly square pyramidal coordination in which the chromium atom is displaced 0 0.53 A above the mean salen plane. The pyri- dine N-oxide adduct takes octahedral coordina- 0 tion and the chromium atom is displaced 0.26 A above the mean salen plane. Both the oxochromium(V) species epoxidize olefins (Fig. 2) [13]. However, these two porphyrin and salen complexes differ from one another in structure (Fig. 3). Whereas the peripheral carbons of the porphyrin ligand are all sp2, the salen ligand bears two spa carbons at C1\" and C2\" which might be replaced with stereogenic carbons and, furthermore, sterically bulky and/or chiral substituents can be introduced at C3 and C3' at 0 N N- II _ i X. o 0 OTf e= 0 N-CIr---N o~ 0.28- Fig. 2.

These stereogenic centers reside proximately to the metal center and this renders the salen ligand a promising chiral template for the construction of asymmetric reaction sites. In fact, these types of optically active (salen)manganese(III) complexes (hereafter referred to as Mn-salen complexes) have been synthesized and found to serve as effective catalysts for asymmetric oxidation. Although preliminary aspects of Mnsalen catalyzed oxidation have been reviewed [15], the scope of the reaction is still extending rapidly and the deeper understanding on the reaction mechanism is now available. Accordingly, we summarize herein the recent advance- Ph rPh -N, \\ / O O PF\\ / 3 H-~H -N, .N M~ \\ / O CI O \\ / R 5, a: R= RBu, b: R= Me 89 ment of Mn-salen catalyzed asymmetric epoxidation and the new aspects of the mechanistic study on the reaction. 2. Mn-salen catalyzed asymmetric epoxidation 2.1. Mn-salen catalysts and general experimental conditions for asymmetric epoxidation In 1990, Jacobsen's and the author's groups reported asymmetric epoxidation with optically active Mn-salen epoxidation catalysts (3 [16]a and 4 [16]b) which have stereogenic centers at CI\" and C2\" and sterically bulky and/or chiral substituents at C3 and C3'. With these catalysts and iodosylbenzene derivatives as terminal oxidants, moderate to good levels of enantioselectivity were achieved in the epoxidation of conjugated olefins. Since then, various modifications of Mn-salen catalysts have been made and much higher enantioselectivity has now been achieved. (For the rational design of optically active Mn-salen catalysts, see the previous reviews [15].) Among various modified Mn-salen catalysts, catalysts (5 [17], 6 [18], 7 [19], 8 [20], and especially 9 [20]) seem to be most effective in terms of enantioselectivity.

Besides iodosylbenzene, aqueous sodium hypochlorite [21], hydrogen peroxide [22], bistrimethylsilyl peroxide [22]b, molecular oxygen [23], and peracid [24,25] can also be used as a terminal oxidant. However, some oxidants require an appropriate additive. In the case of hydrogen peroxide or bistrimethylsilyl peroxide, the co-existence of N-alkylimidazole is indispensable. The reaction of the peroxide with Mn(III)-salen complex gives a peroxy species [RO-O-MIII] (R = H or Me3Si) that does not effect oxygen transfer. The heterolytic O-O bond cleavage of the peroxy species giving an active oxo manganese species is essential for oxo transfer reaction and this bond cleavage is promoted by the coordination of a strong donor ligand such as N-methylimidazole to manganese ion [22]. Mukaiyama and co-workers have reported that molecular oxygen can also be used as a terminal oxidant in combination with pivalaldehyde [23]. With this system, it has been proposed that the reaction of molecular oxygen with Mn-salen complex in the presence of an aldehyde provides highly reactive acylperoxy Mn-salen species [RCOZ-O-Mnin] which epoxidize olefins directly. However, the same reaction in the presence of the donor ligand such as N-alkylimidazole is considered to proceed by way of oxo species [26]. This has been supported by the fact that the sense of enantioface selection observed in the absence of the donor ligand is opposite to that observed in the presence of the donor ligand. Furthermore, diketoiminato-manganese(III) complex (10) which is structurally related to Mn-salen complex has also been found to be a useful catalyst for simple conjugated olefins, when the combination of molecular oxygen and an aldehyde is used as an oxidant [27]. Epoxidation with mchloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA) can be carried out in the presence of N-methylmorpholine Noxide [24,25]. N-Methylmorpholine N-oxide depresses the undesired epoxidation with free m-CPBA. Although there is no description about active species in this reaction, it seems reasonable to postulate that acylperoxy species is an active species also in this reaction in analogy with Mukaiyama's reaction. This may also be supported from the fact that epoxidation with oxo species at - 78 is very slow [28], while the epoxidation with m-CPBA is fast even at - 78 [24]. Ph` Ph -0M O -O O_ 10 T. Katsuki /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 113 (1996) 87-107 The author and co-workers found that asymmetric induction by Mn-salon catalyst is affected by the donor ligand added to the reaction medium [29,30]. Donor ligands such as 2methylimidazole and pyridine N-oxide derivatives, especially 4-N, N-dimethylaminopyridine N-oxide [19] and 4-phenylpyridine N-oxide [31], bring about the enhancement of enantioselectivity. However, the addition of a donor ligand shows negative effect in the epoxidation of trans-stilbene [29]. The effect of a donor ligand on enantioselectivity is considered to be attributable to the change of the structure of the salen ligand by coordination of the ligand [30]. In connection with this, the reaction using hydrogen peroxide usually shows slightly diminished enantioselectivity as compared with the reaction using iodosyl benzene or aqueous sodium hypochlorite in the presence of pyridine N-oxide derivatives, probably because N- 91 methylimidazole is a less effective axial ligand in terms of enantioselectivity enhancement. Besides increasing enantioselectivity, the addition of a donor ligand improves the yield of the epoxide in most cases, because coordination of a donor ligand to manganese ion depresses the Lewis acidity [28] of oxo Mn-salon complexes and prevents the decomposition of acid sensitive epoxide. Ligand-free cationic oxo Mn-salon species often decompose acid-sensitive epoxides under the reaction conditions even at low temperature. Mn-salon catalyzed epoxidation can be carried out in various solvents such as acetonitrile, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and ether at varied temperature (25 - -40). However, the reaction is very slow at the temperature as low as - 78 [28], except when using m-CPBA as an oxidant [24]. In general, enantioselectivity is enhanced, as the reaction temperature becomes Table 1 Asymmetric epoxidation of monosubstituted olefins using (salen)manganese(III) complexes as catalysts salon catalyst, terminal oxidant o 2 Entry Substrate t-Bu Ph Catalyst 9 Ila Solvent Oxidant Temp.

T Katsuki /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 113 (1996) 87-107 2.2.3. cis-Disubstituted olefins Conjugated cis-disubstituted olefins are generally good substrates for Mn-salen catalyzed epoxidation and high enantioselectivity up to > 99% e.e. has been achieved, except for simple 1,3-cycloalkadienes (Table 3). Epoxidation of simple 1,3-cycloalkadienes with most Mnsalen catalysts shows only moderate enantioselectivity probably due to the poor electrostatic repulsion between the unsaturated olefinic substituent and the salen ligand (vide infra) [39]. However, the epoxidation with Mn-salen catalyst 9 that has an electron-rich phenyl sub- 97 stituent in the space over the salen-benzene ring shows good to excellent level of enantioselectivity, especially when the reaction is carried out at depressed temperature (-18), using aqueous sodium hypochlorite saturated with sodium chloride as a terminal oxidant (entries 1, 5, 9, and 12) [33]. Although epoxidation of dialkylsubstituted olefins usually shows insufficient enantioselectivity [39] except for that of 3,3-ethylenedioxycyclohexene (entry 10) [17], epoxidation of (Z)-1-cyclohexyl-l-propene with 9 under the above reaction conditions shows good enantioselectivity of 82% e.e.

Katsuki /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 113 (1996) 87-107 Reaction of acyclic conjugated cis-disubstituted olefins gives a mixture of cis and trans epoxides probably through a radical intermediate (Fig. 4, R 0 H). In this connection, Jacobsen and co-workers have recently found that the reaction in the presence of a quaternary ammonium salt provides traps-epoxide preferentially (entries 11, 17, 68, and 69) [40]. Although the role of the ammonium salt in these reactions has not been clarified, this provides an alternate procedure for obtaining optically active transepoxides. In contrast to this, they have reported that epoxidation with m-CPBA in the presence of N-methylmorpholine N-oxide at - 78 provides cis-epoxides exclusively with excellent enantioselectivity (entry 19) [25]. However, un- Table 5 Asymmetric epoxidation of tetrasubstituted olefins using (salen)manganese(III) complexes as catalysts der these conditions, epoxidation of a,unsaturated ester does not proceed, differing from the reaction using aqueous NaOCI as an oxidant (entries 51 and 52). 2.2.4.

Tetrasubstituted olefins Some conjugated tetrasubstituted olefins also show high enantioselectivity in Mn-salen catalyzed epoxidation (Table 5, entries 4, 5, 7 and 9) but the enantioselectivity seems strongly dependent upon the catalyst used (cf. entries 6 and 7, and entries 8 and 9) [48]. 3. The mechanism of one oxygen atom transfer and of asymmetric induction by Mn-salen catalyst Although excellent levels of enantioselectivity have been achieved in Mn-salen catalyzed epoxidation of simple olefins, there is still a controversy on its reaction mechanism, especially about the mechanism of oxo transfer from the putative oxo (salen)manganese(V) species to olefins. Here we briefly review the mechanisms proposed to date. 99 3.1. The structure of oxo Mn-salen complex No oxo metallosalen complex has been isolated except for oxo Cr-salen complexes in which salen ligands take square planar coordination as described in the Section Section 1 [13]. Although the structures of oxo Mn-salen complexes have not been determined yet, it seems reasonable that the salen ligand in the oxo Mnsalen complex also takes square planar geometry. This assumption was supported by the experiment of oxo Mn-salen catalyzed Diels-Alder reaction. Oxo Mn-salen and N-tosylimino Mn-salen complexes (16 and 17) serve not only as oxidizing agents but also as Lewis acid catalysts. In general, the oxidation (epoxidation and aziridination) proceeds at usual reaction conditions but, below - 70, these complexes serve mainly as a Lewis acid catalyst and do not oxidize olefins.

Ph ph ''s 4 reaction with these complexes (16 and 17) as catalysts and found that 16 and 17 showed the same level of enantioselectivity and exo / endo ratio (Scheme 1). If the salen ligand takes a bent structure (18 or 19), dienophile must coordinate cis to the ligand X (21 or 22) and, therefore, exchange of the ligand X from oxygen atom to N-tosylimino group should affect enantioselectivity and exo / endo ratio of the reaction. However, this is not the case as described above. On the other hand, if the salen ligand takes square planar geometry like 16 and 17, the ligand X and dienophile occupy two distant axial positions as shown in 20, respectively, and the exchange of the ligand (X) little affects on enantioselectivity [28,32]. This is the case observed. RL Ra RL b ERs He. H t~ c _ _ N,,9. 'M^*_ CI \\ 5/ 5a Scheme 2. O..- O~M1) side-on approach W~On~ 0 '0 top-on approach Fig. 5. Olefin's approach to oxo metal species. complex 3.2. Approach of olefins to the oxo Mn-salen In porphyrin-catalyzed epoxidation reactions, olefins are considered to approach the metaloxo bond from its side and parallel to the porphyrin ring (so called side-on approach, Fig. 5) [49]. This side-on or skewed side-on [36] approach has also been considered to be applicable to the salen-catalyzed epoxidation, because of the structural similarity between porphyrin and salen complexes '. However, a topon approach has recently been proposed for the epoxidation of tetrasubstituted olefins for steric reason [48]. With the side-on or skewed side-on approach, three pathways (a, b, and c) for the incoming olefin have been proposed (Scheme 2). In the early stages of the author's and Jacobsen's studies, Mn-salen complexes (3 and 4) were introduced based on the hypothesis that olefins ap- 1 For example, Jorgensen explained the stereochemistry observed in the epoxidation using (salen)manganese and manganese prophyrin catalysts, with the same transition state model [50]. T. Katsuki /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 113 (1996) 87-107 proach along the pathway a between nitrogen and oxygen atoms, orienting their bulkier olefinic substituent away from C3(3')-substituent to avoid the steric repulsion with C3(3') substituent [16]. However, Jacobsen and co-workers have proposed a different pathway in the epoxidation with modified Mn-salen complex 5a in which 5,5'-t-butyl groups stand in the pathway a. Although strong steric repulsion between the 5(5')-substituent and the incoming olefin along the pathway a is expected, 5a catalyzes the epoxidation smoothly and exhibits high enantioselectivity. Based on this result, Jacobsen and co-workers proposed pathway b passing between two nitrogen atoms, wherein the larger substituent on the incoming olefin has been considered to be directed away from C2\" axial hydrogen atom [17]. Our recent results, however, cast some doubt on this proposal. Complex 14 bearing axial methyl groups at C3\" and C6\" carbons is expected to show an opposite sense of asymmetric induction to that observed with complex 13, as long as olefins approach along the pathway b. This is not the case. Both 13 and 14 show the same sense of asymmetric induction (Table 3, entries 33, 34, 49, and 50) [43]. Although only steric repulsion is considered as the factor controlling the orientation of the incoming olefin in the above discussions, enantioface selectivity of some substrates cannot be rationalized by considering only steric factors. In general, cis-methylstyrene exhibits better enantioselectivity than (Z)-1-cyclohexyl-l-propene, though the bulkiness of the cyclohexyl group is roughly equal to that of the phenyl loi group. 4-Cyclohexyl-l-trimethylsilyl-3-buten1-yne is a better substrate than 4-phenyl-l-trimethylsilyl-3-buten-1-yne (Table 3, entries 61 and 62) [31]. These stereochernistries seem strange at first, but they can be rationalized by considering both the steric and Tr-electronic repulsions between the salen ligand and the olefinic substituent [39,51 ]. The incoming olefin along the pathway a or c feels different electronic atmospheres at each side of the pathway, because a Tr-electron-rich salen benzene ring exists at one side of the pathway and a cyclohexane ring bearing no w-electron exists at the other side. The repulsive rr-,a electron interaction between the benzene ring of salen ligand and the unsaturated olefinic substituent cooperates with steric repulsion to direct the ole%nic substituent away from C3' substituent as well as the salen-benzene ring [39]. Thus, olefins bearing sterically bulky and 7c-electron-rich substituents at one terminal carbon show high enantioselectivity. As described above, the pathway a in the epoxidation with catalyst 5a was denied due to the presence of 5,5'-t-butyl groups. Accordingly only the pathway c seemed to give a rational explanation on the mechanism of asymmetric induction [51]. The above discussion are all based on the assumption that the salen ligand of the oxo species takes a planar structure (Fig. 6), however, some experimental results suggest that salen ligands do not take a planar structure, but a folded structure. X-ray analysis of the pyridine N-oxide adduct of oxo the Cr-salen complex has shown that the salen ligand takes a folded structure (23, M = Cr, L = pyridine Noxide) [13].

Examination of the stereochemistry of Co-salen catalyzed asymmetric cyclopropanation has also suggested that the salen ligand of Co(V)-salen carbenoid complex takes a folded structure and that the non-symmetrically folded salen ligand strongly influences the enantioselectivity of the reaction [53]. Although no oxo Mn-salen complex has been isolated, these findings suggest that the salen ligand also has a folded structure. If so, 5'-substituent does not interfere with the approach of olefins along the pathway a. Actually, the stereochemistry observed in most Mn-salen cat- o T.

Mechanism of one oxygen atom transfer from oxo Mn-salen complex to olefins However, there is still controversy on the mechanism of oxygen atom transfer from oxo species to the incoming olefin. One suggestion is that the incoming olefin attacks the electrophilic oxygen atom in a side-on manner and then one electron transfers from the olefin to the oxo bond to give a radical intermediate, when the substrate bears a radical stabilizing group ' d O b c 0 -0.4 -0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.60.8 Fig. 7.

Sharpless' proposal on the mechanism of oxidation with oxo metal species. (Scheme 3). This proposal has long been accepted for Mn-salen catalyzed epoxidation [ 12,15]. On the other hand, alkylsubstituted olefins have been considered to be epoxidized in a concerted process from the following observation by Jacobsen et al. [54]. Epoxidation of trans-2-phenyl-l-vinylcyclopropane gives the corresponding epoxide and no product of cyclopropane cleavage is detected. If a radical intermediate intervenes, the product of cyclopropane cleavage should be detected, since the rate of rearrangement of a secondary phenylcyclopropyl radical is very fast (> 10's-1). These two scenarios seem to be compatible with Jacobsen's observation that Mn-salen complexes with an electron-donating group at C5 and CS' show higher asymmetric induction than that with an electron-withdrawing group (Fig. 7) [55].

The two metallaoxetane intermediates found in calculation. well with the a-value of substituents. This electronic effect has been attributed to the change in the reactivity of the oxo species. The electrondonating substituent decreases the reactivity of the oxo species and the reaction with less reactive oxo species proceeds via a more productlike transition state, resulting in more specific non-bonded interactions and better enantioselectivity. In 1977, Sharpless and co-workers proposed that the reaction of oxo metal species and olefins reversibly gives a metallaoxetane intermediate which is converted to oxidation product(s) (Scheme 4) [56], and recently they demonstrated that the asymmetric dihydroxylation using chirally modified osmium tetroxide as a catalyst proceeds through a metallaoxetane intermediate Ph~Ph N,I~,N _ ~+ _ Moo \\ / ~O \\ / OM PF Ph' H Ph, _ H Ph'= 4-t-Ph 27 9: 82% ee 26: 77% ee 02N ~O Ph10 02N 0 7: 96% ee AcNH I ~ A~ I O 27.64% ee Scheme 5. l T. Katsuki /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 113 (1996) 87-107 by analyzing the relationship between reaction temperature and enantioselectivity (vide infra) 3.5 [57]. Norrby and Akermark have recently pro posed that Mn-salen catalyzed epoxidation pro ceeds by way of a metallaoxetane intermediate (Fig. 4) based on the calculation using Macro- model/MM3 [58]. According to their model, the enantioselectivity of the reaction can be explained by the energy difference between two diastereomeric metallaoxetane intermediates (24 and 25). Intermediate 24 giving the major enan tiomer of the epoxide is more stable than 25 by 11 kcal/mol (Fig. 8, The figure was kindly provided by Dr. P.-O. Norrby.). They have pointed out a possibility that the cis-trans iso merization observed during the epoxidation of cis-alkenes is attributable to a rotation around the carbon-carbon single bond of the intermedi ate brought by the heterolysis of metal oxygen bond. 0 o= The author and co-workers independently found experimental proofs that Mn-salen catalyzed epoxidation proceeds through a reversibly formed intermediate (Scheme 5): epoxidation of some substrates using our catalysts (26 and 27) modified with an electron-donating methoxy group gave a lower enantioselectivity than that using the unmodified parent catalysts (9 and 7). Epoxidations of 1,3-cyclooctadiene with 26 and of 6-acetamido-2,2-dimethyl-7nitrochromene with 27 showed lower enantioselectivity than those with 9 and 7, respectively. In addition to this, we also found that epoxidation of 1,3-cyclooctadiene with 9 showed maximum enantioselectivity at 0 (Fig. 9) [32]. In most asymmetric reactions, enantioselectivity increases, as the reaction temperature is decreased. This is true if the reaction proceeds through only one transition state, and the ob- 0.5 0 3.3 3.5 3.7 3.9 4.1 4.34.5 103V (K1 ) 0~) (B) (D Fig. 9. Non-linear relationship between enantioselectivity and temperature. served linear relationship between enantioselectivity and reaction temperature is expressed by Eyring's equation: AAH In (P) _' RT* + R # P _ I (major enantiomer of eide) l' (minor enantiomer of eide) `enantioselectivity' in this equation is expressed by ln( R / S). In contrast to this, Scharf and co-workers have demonstrated that a reaction which involves reversible formation of diastereomeric intermediates and irreversible transformation of the intermediates to a product or another intermediate has a possibility to show non-linear relationship between enantioselectivity and reaction temperature [59]. Scharf's proposal explains our findings reasonably well and suggests the presence of the reversibly formed diastereomeric intermediates in Mn-salen catalyzed epoxidation. Assuming the metallaoxetane intermediate as the reversibly formed intermediate gives a reasonable explanation to our observations. Although the epoxidation of conjugated cisolefins provides a mixture of cis- and transepoxides, the epoxidation of cis-dialkylsubstituted olefin is slow but stereospeci%c to give the corresponding cis-epoxide exclusively [39]. This is compatible with Jacobsen's report on the epoxidation of trans-2-phenyl-l-vinylcyclopropane [54]. These results probably suggest T. Katsuki/Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 113 (1996) 87-107 that the intermediary metallaoxetane decomposes quickly to a radical intermediate in the epoxidation of conjugated olefins, while the metallaoxetane intermediate is converted slowly but directly to the epoxide in the reaction of non-conjugated olefins [32]. Considering the above arguments, the author and co-workers have proposed a new reaction mechanism for Mn-salen catalyzed epoxidation including metallaoxetane and radical intermediates in tandem (Scheme 6) [32]: Olefins approach the oxo-metal bond from its side probably along the pathway a (Fig. 6), directing their bulky and rr-electron-rich substituent away from the C3'-substituent to minimize steric and electronic repulsions. Though coordination of the s0 ~* \\=iLRL i 3' 6 O-Mn, -/\\2 Rt RZ favored orientation clockwise krast// klaw _o H Mn- r R~ ~ Rt R3 R2 28 kst O R3 o- n~ Rt \\,-low 105 olefin to the metal ion followed by oxygen atom insertion with rotation may provide four possible metallaoxetane intermediates (28, 29,30, and 31) [56], the pathway to the intermediates 29 and 30 (counter-clockwise rotation) is considered to be disfavored by the steric repulsion between the olefmic substituent and the C3'substituent. The salen ligand in the resulting metallaoxetanes (28 and 31) takes a bent form in which one of the phenolic oxygen atom coordinates at axial site, since the oxygen and carbon atoms of the metallaoxetane coordinate at axial and equatorial coordination site, respectively. That the salen ligand takes a bent form seems to be justifiable, since most of the salen ligands in Cr-, Fe-, and Co-salen complexes counterclockwise H R3 O,.Mn_ Rt R2 disfavored orientation : ~ H O H Mn,N s -~ Rt RL Rt R R3 4229 R2 30 RL= alkyl 8 V RL R2 32 + H RL= Aryl, alkenyl, alkynyl R3 O_Mn.N--~ Rt 42 kslOw RL= alkyl \\\\ mgt RL O I H Mn-N \\ s ~ Rt R3 31 42 clockwise slow R L 0 $k-iH - R3 O--Mnn Rt 33 RL= Aryl, alkenyl, alkynyl T H O- Mn.

Katsuki/Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 113 (1996) 87-107 having a divalent ligand such as oxalate or acetylacetonate take a bent form [60]. The un stable metallaoxetane (28) bearing a radical sta bilizing group on the carbon proximal to man ganese ion rapidly collapses to a radical inter mediate (32), while the metallaoxetane (31) bearing alkyl group at the carbon proximal to manganese ion is slowly transformed into epox ides as discussed above. Thus enantioface selec tion performed in metallaoxetane formation step is further enhanced by the second diastereose lective metallaoxetane cleavage process, since the metallaoxetane formation is reversible [56]. References Accordingly, olefins bearing a radical stabiliz- ing group such as aryl, alkenyl, or alkynyl group show excellent levels of enantioselectiv ity. In the case of alkyl-substituted olefins, both the intermediates (28 and 31) collapse slowly to the corresponding epoxides and diastereoselec tive cleavage can not be expected. Thus, olefins bearing only alkyl substituents show moderate enantioselectivity [32]. Quite recently, the polymer-bound optically active Mn-salen complex was synthesized and applied to the epoxidation of conjugated olefins. However, the enantioselectivity observed with this complex was considerably lower than that with monomeric Mn-salen complex [61 ]. The unexpectedly low enantioselectivity was at tributed to steric reasons and/or certain mi croenvironmental effect associated with the macromolecular system [61], but the restriction on the structural change of the salen ligand by anchoring to a solid polymer may also influence on the enantioselectivity. 4. Conclusion Studies on salen-catalyzed epoxidation started in the search for stereoselective oxo transfer reaction comparable to the biological process catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 and a fairly good level of enantioselectivity has been achieved in the epoxidation of conjugated olefins to date, though further improvement is required in the epoxidation of simple olefins. Many new findings obtained in (these studies also shed light on the mechanisms of oxo transfer reaction and of asymmetric induction. However, our knowledge on the structures of catalytically fictive oxo Mn-salen species and their reactivity is still immature and further study is required for the future development of Mn-salen catalyzed oxo transfer reaction.
