Graphical abstract Environmentally friendly non-sulfided mesostructured Ni/γ-alumina catalysts were synthesized and developed to produce green diesel from canola oil. The catalysts were prepared either by a one-pot sol-gel (SG) via evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) or by incipient wetness impregnation (IMP). They were characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption, XRD, XPS, NH3-TPD and TEM. Due to the incorporation of nickel in the mesostructured framework, bulk nickel oxide species are lower for SG catalysts compared to IMP ones. Formation of active metallic nickel was confirmed after in-situ pre-reduction in H2 for both SG and IMP catalysts. Continuous hydrotreatment of canola oil was performed in a down-flow fixed-bed reactor, and the liquid hydrocarbon products mainly contained C15-C18 n-alkanes. SG catalyst exhibited a better stability up to 10 h of time on stream (TOS). The IMP catalyst initially showed higher conversion than SG up to TOS:300 min; it thereafter decreased sharply to values lower than those of SG.

These exhausting sources of energy increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, particularly carbon dioxide, and consequently lead to global warming. Since the energy demand is steadily growing; many research studies have focussed on finding some alternative sustainable energy sources [1,2]. Among all types of renewable energy sources such as hydropower, solar power, wind power and fuel cells; the only one that is capable of producing stored energy in the form of material is biomass. Noticeably, it does not contribute to GHG emission owing to its carbon-neutrality. Moreover, biomass-derived products, which might be in solid, liquid, or gas form, could be directly used as fuel or as raw materials to produce downstream value added products such as bio-based polymers and chemicals. The use of biomass can also create employment in different geographical sectors for local residents, strengthening the economy, reducing the rural to urban area migration and increasing the national energy security [3–5]. Among the constituents of biomass that can be used as a raw material to make green liquid fuels are triglycerides. The primary feedstock sources of triglycerides are plants, waste cooking derived oils, animal fats and algae [6–9]. A recently developed method for producing pure green diesel is the catalytic deoxygenation of bio-derived triglyceride molecules via hydrotreatment process. The hydrotreated products mainly consist of a mixture of n-alkanes with carbon numbers in the range of that of diesel hydrocarbons. In this process, first, all CC bonds are saturated in the presence of hydrogen, followed by removal of oxygen molecules. The removal of the oxygen could mainly take place via three different reaction pathways involving: hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), decarbonylation (DCO) and decarboxylation (DCO2) removing oxygen in the form of H2O, H2O/CO, and CO2, respectively. The hydrotreating reaction can go through HDO or DCO/DCO2 pathways. In the former, the final product will consist of molecules with the same carbon number as the corresponding fatty acids present in the triglycerides molecules, while in the latter the carbon number of the product molecules will be one less. The hydrogen consumption trend through these patterns follows the sequence of HDO > DCO > DCO2 leading to HDO being the dominant pathway under high H2 pressure. This causes particular economic interest to find suitable process conditions and prominent catalysts favoring the latter two pathways [10,11]. Two groups of metals; precious noble metals (Pt and Pd) and promoted transition metals (NiMo, CoMo, etc.) loaded on different supports such as γ-alumina, zeolites, and activated carbons were used as catalysts for the hydrotreatment of triglycerides [6,12–17]. The main drawbacks of noble metals to be used in the catalysts include high cost and difficult accessibility (the cost of Pt/Pd is around 3223/3015 times and 497/465 times higher than Ni and Co, respectively) [18]. On the other hand, transition metals are used in their sulfided form, and it is required to maintain their sulfided form along the reaction. This can be done by introducing sulfur bearing agents in the feed. The leaching of sulfur from catalysts is harmful to human health and gives rise to environmental pollution. Also, sulfur causes infrastructure damage and trace contamination of the products [19]. These disadvantages have led to a considerable interest to find non-sulfided efficient catalysts for triglyceride hydrotreating. Textural properties of the catalysts such as specific surface area, pore size, pore volume and metal species crystallite domain size, significantly affect the catalytic efficiency. High surface area and large pore diameter enhance the catalytic activity in hydrotreatment of triglycerides. The pores diameter of the catalyst should be large enough to allow the large triglyceride molecules (the size of a triglyceride molecule is estimated to be 15–25 Å) to easily enter the pores and reach the active sites of the catalyst [20,21]. The high-cost zeolite supports have small pore diameters which is not desired when the reactants are bulky molecules such as triglycerides. Also, the high acidity of these supports leads to an increase in the yield of lighter products as a consequence of enhanced cracking [13]. Hydrotreatment of triglycerides tends to the accumulation of coke on the surface of the catalysts. When carbon is used as a support, in most of the cases, it is not possible to regenerate the catalysts via economic air combustion and reuse the catalysts [22,23]. Mesoporous γ-alumina with tunable textural properties, mild acidity, and high thermal stability could be a good candidate to be used as support for the diesel-like hydrocarbons production via hydrotreatment [24]. Gousi et al., have recently explored the usefulness of the co-precipitated monometallic Ni/alumina in reduced form, on the deoxygenation of sunflower oil. They used a semi-batch reactor with reaction conditions set at H2 pressure of 40 bar, and a temperature of 310 °C. The final product that was obtained under such conditions mainly consisted of n-C15 to n-C18 [25]. Hachemi et al., employed the wetness impregnation method using nickel salt and commercial γ-alumina to synthesize 5% wt. Ni/γ-Al2O3. They demonstrated a high selectivity to C17 hydrocarbons over Ni/γ-Al2O3 in the hydrotreatment of stearic acid as a model compound in a semi-batch system [12]. Li et al., produced jet fuel from waste cooking and palm oils over reduced Ni catalysts loaded on different zeolite supports via hydrotreatment in a batch reactor [26,27]. Kim et al., employed reduced Ni and Pt catalysts for the hydrotreatment of soybean oil in an autoclave reactor and reported that DCO-DCO2 were the dominant pathways over both catalysts [28]. Yenumala et al. prepared Ni/γ-alumina catalysts using commercial γ-alumina as the support. They performed the hydrotreatment of karanja oil in a semi-batch reactor. The obtained results proved the formation of diesel range hydrocarbons by preserving the triglycerides backbone chains [24]. To date, there has been very little research exploring the use of monometallic transition metals for the hydrotreatment of triglycerides in a continuous process [29]. Kubička and Kaluža used Ni/Al2O3 in the sulfided form for the hydrotreating of refined rapeseed oil in a continuous fixed-bed reactor. They found a very low oxygen removal efficiency and showed that DCO-DCO2 are the predominant pathways [30]. Santinllan-Jimenez et al. showed that the DCO-DCO2 reaction pathways are dominant over different supported monometallic Ni catalysts in a continuous semi-batch reactor. However, the triglycerides percentages in the feed introduced to the reactor was very low [31]. Kaewmeesri et al. and Srifa et al. used reduced Ni/γ-alumina for continuous hydrotreating of triglycerides. It was found that the dominant pathway is the DCO-DCO2 and reported a longer TOS over Ni/γ-alumina compared to Co/γ-alumina [8,32,33]. Since the sol-gel method allows stabilizing and confining of the metal particles in the mesoporous framework and yields homogeneous distribution of metal species, the sol-gel synthesized catalysts showed high stability over time while being used in different chemical reactions. This high stability arises from some reduction in sintering of the metallic nanoparticles due to the strong interaction between the mesoporous support and the particles [34,35]. Thus, in this study, nickel is chosen as the transitional metal for the hydrotreatment of canola oil as a triglycerides source. To elucidate the dependence of catalytic efficiency and stability over time to the structure of the catalysts; one pot sol-gel via Evaporation-Induced Self-Assembly (EISA) and conventional incipient wetness methods were employed for catalysts synthesis. The performance of these two kinds of Ni-based catalysts was compared for the production of green diesel in a continuous down-flow fixed bed reactor. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Catalyst synthesis Ni/γ-alumina catalysts were prepared by a one-pot sol-gel method via evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA). A specific amount of triblock copolymer (Pluronic P123): Poly(ethylene glycol)20-block-poly(propylene glycol)70-block-poly(ethylene glycol)20 (Average Mn ≈ 5800 g/mol, Sigma-Aldrich, CAS no.9003-11-6) as a soft template was dissolved at ambient temperature using a magnetic stirrer in 20 ml anhydrous ethanol (Commercial alcohols Co., CAS no.67-17-5). The desired amount of (Ni (NO3)2·6H2O) (Sigma-Aldrich, CAS no. 13478-00-7) was then added to the above solution and agitated at least for 6 h (solution A). In another beaker Al (O-i-Pr)3 (Sigma-Aldrich, CAS no. 555-31-7) as the alumina precursor and 3.2 ml HNO3 69% wt. (Sigma-Aldrich, CAS no. 7697-37-2) were added to 20 ml anhydrous ethanol and mixed for 6 h (solution B). Solutions A and B were mixed and continuously stirred (600 rpm) together overnight at ambient temperature. The resulting solutions were poured into Petri dishes and aged in a drying oven for 4 days at 60 °C letting the solvent to evaporate and the EISA process to take place. After the EISA process green to light green homogeneous solids were obtained. The total quantity of (Al + Ni) was kept constant, corresponding to a molar composition of 20 mmol. The mass ratio of Ni/Al was adjusted accordingly to (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%). The mass ratio of P123/Al(O-i-Pr)3 was equal to 1.07 for all samples. For comparison, a sample was also prepared with 10% wt. nickel without using the P123 polymeric template. All chemicals were used as received. Calcination was carried out by gently heating the samples from 50 to 700 °C with a four-step calcination procedure in the air atmosphere. First, the temperature was increased from 50 to 160 °C and remained at this temperature for 2 h. The temperature was then raised from 160 to 280 °C and kept constant for 2 h. Afterward, the temperature was raised again from 280 to 400 °C with a 2 h residence time, and finally from 400 to 700 °C and maintained for 3 h. Between plateaus, the heating rate remained constant for the whole calcination procedure at 1 °Cmin−1 ramping rate. This stepwise calcination process secures the complete removal of the polymeric template along with the formation of crystalline metal oxide species. For comparison, Ni/γ-alumina sample was prepared via traditional impregnation method. In short, home-made mesoporous γ-alumina (details can be found in [14]), and nickel (II) hexahydrate (Ni (NO3)2·6H2O) (Sigma-Aldrich, CAS no. 13478-00-7) were agitated with deionized water inside a double jacket Pyrex reactor connected to a digitally-controlled water bath at 60 °C for 12 h. The loading of nickel was adjusted to 10% wt. Ni. The resulting solution was then dried at 60 °C for 24 h and ground to a fine homogeneous powder. Subsequently, the calcination process was performed in the air from 50 to 700 °C, with a rate of 1 °C min−1 and a soaking time of 3 h at the final temperature. All the catalysts were in-situ reduced inside the reactor under H2 atmosphere prior to being used. The designation of SG-X% indicates mesoporous ordered catalysts prepared via one pot sol-gel method where X% represents the weight percentages of the introduced nickel on alumina. The WT, IMP, and R designations are denoting the samples without template, impregnated and reduced catalysts, respectively. 2.2 Catalytic activity measurement Canola oil provided by Saporito Inc., Canada, with the fatty acid composition of (palmitic) C16:0 = 4.1, (stearic) C18:0 = 1.8, (oleic) C18:1 = 62.7, (linoleic) C18:2 = 19.6, (linolenic) C18:3 = 9.0, (arachidic) C20:0 = 0.6 and (behenic) C22:0 = 0.3 in wt.% was selected as feed. The feed was hydrotreated in a stainless steel 316 custom made tubular fixed-bed down-flow reactor (25.8 mm internal diameter and 400 mm length). The catalyst samples were prepared by making compressed pellets from powders using a hydraulic press. Then, they were crushed and held inside the reactor between quartz wool on a stainless steel grid. Before the reaction, the reactor was loaded with catalyst. To remove oxygen and the adsorbed species on the surface of the catalysts, N2 (60 mL min−1) was introduced to the reactor, and the temperature was raised to 250 °C for 30 min; then cooled down to room temperature. Next, the catalysts were reduced in-situ by increasing the temperature from 50 to 600 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and 3 h soaking time under H2 flow with a rate of 60 mLmin−1 at atmospheric pressure. The reactor was then pressurized under N2 and cooled down to the reaction temperature. After reaching steady state, the hydrogen gas and oil were introduced to the reactor at constant reaction condition of T = 400 °C, P = 3.45 MPa, LHSV  = 0.5 h−1, and H2/oil = 600 mL mL−1. The effect of different catalyst types on the liquid composition was then investigated. Liquid products were collected after passing through a high-pressure condenser connected to a cooling circulator by the aid of a high-pressure low-temperature separator. The oil was introduced into the reactor (without any dilution) at a constant rate using a high-pressure HPLC pump, Lab Alliance Serie II (6000 psi max pressure, 0.01–10 mLmin−1). The feed flow rate was adjusted to the setpoint in a circuit line while the reactor temperature and pressure stabilized. Tubular electrical furnace (Thermo scientificTM) was used to set-out the reactor temperature. For superior accuracy, a second thermocouple was placed inside the reactor alongside the catalyst bed in the middle of the reactor. Gases (H2/N2) were fed using Bronkhorst Co. mass flow controller (2100 psi max pressure). A back pressure regulator, 26–1700 series (TESCOM) coupled with an electropneumatic actuator, ER3000 series (TESCOM) were utilized to control the reactor operating pressure. The concentration of triglycerides and normal alkane distributions in the product were obtained from HPLC and GC–MS analysis, respectively. The oil conversion (C) was defined as follows. (1) C o n v e r s i o n ( C ) = T o t a l m a s s o f t r i g l y c e r i d e c o n s u m e d I n i t i a l m a s s o f t r i g l y c e r i d e × 100 2.3 Characterization 2.3.1 Nitrogen adsorption-desorption analysis The adsorption-desorption isotherms of the synthesized catalysts were collected using a Quantachrome Nova 2000 instruments at −196 °C. The calculations were done using the Autosorb-1 software, (Quantachrome Instruments). About 400–500 mg of the samples were put into the glass cell, and the degasification was performed by reaching a residual pressure of 10−6 mbar, at 200 °C for a 5 h residence time. To determine the specific surface area, Standard Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) isotherm was used considering the linear part of the isotherm in the relative pressure (P/P0) range of 0.05–0.2. Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) calculation method was employed using the adsorption branch of the isotherms to calculate the pore width. The total pore volumes (Vt) were calculated according to the volume of adsorbed nitrogen at a relative pressure of P/P0 = 0.99. Non-local density functional theory (NLDFT) was also applied to determine the specific surface area (SDFT), total pore volume (VDFT) and pore width (WDFT). Considering the cylindrical shape of pores, pore size distributions were determined using the kernel of NLDFT with the equilibrium isotherm of N2 at −196 °C on silica. 2.3.2 X-ray diffraction (XRD) Wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) patterns were acquired using a Siemens D5000 monochromatic diffractometer with a radiation source of Cu Kα; operating at room temperature, a voltage of 40 kV and a current of 30 mA. The count time was 1.2 s with a step size of 0.02°. The counts were recorded in the range of 2θ = 10–90°. The samples were finely ground (<100 μm) before the test. An additional Poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) sample holder was used for the samples with low content. Crystalline phase identification was established by comparison of the recorded diffraction patterns with Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) database using X’pert HighScore software (version 1.0d, PAN analytical B.V., Almelo, Netherlands). Scherrer’s Eq. (2) was employed with applied Warren’s correction to roughly calculate the mean crystal domain size of the samples. (2) D = K λ β C o s θ where K ≈ 0.9 (Scherrer constant), λ = 1.54059 Å (wavelength), and θ is the position of Bragg’s diffraction angle. β)efficient linewidth of the X-ray reflection) is obtained considering β2 = B2 − b2, where B is the full width at half maximum (FWHM), and b represents the value of instrumental broadening defined by the X-ray reflection of quartz with particle size ≥150 nm, at 2θ ≈ 27 °FWHM, respectively, in radians [36]. Using interplanar spacing cubic lattice planes (d hkl) for a set of lattice planes, the lattice parameter (a) of samples were calculated using Eq. (3). (3) d h k l = α h k l h 2 + k 2 + l 2 where h,k,l are the Miller integer indices [37]. 2.3.3 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) A KRATOS Axis-Ultra electron spectrometer (UK) was used to record X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra employing an Al monochromatic or Mg non-monochromatic source operating at 300 watt s. The samples were placed on a stainless steel sample holder, and the pressure was 10−8 Torr or lower during the analysis. The survey scans were acquired using a pass energy of 160 eV and a step size of 1 eV. The Ni2p and C1s high-resolution spectra were recorded with step sizes of 0.10 and 0.05 eV and pass energies of 40 and 20 eV respectively. The electrostatic charge was neutralized using a very low energy and integrated electron flood gun for the optimization of the counting rate parameters and energy resolution. The CasaXPS software (version 2.3.17PR1.1) was used to analyze the collected spectra and calculate the surface atomic ratios. The binding energy scales were calibrated by Au4f7/2, Ag3d5/2, and Cu2p3/2 at binding energies of 83.95, 368.2, 932.6 eV, respectively. The CH carbon peak at 285.0 eV was used to correct the binding energies. 2.3.4 Temperature programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD) The surface acidity of the catalysts was determined by using an RXM 100 multi catalyst testing and characterization system from Advanced Scientific Design (ASDI) Inc. V 4.12. Ammonia was used as a probe molecule. Before the analysis 0.100 g catalyst was loaded to a quartz U-shape reactor, then calcined from 25 to 600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 with residence time of 3 h under He flow of 20 mL min−1 to remove possible impurities on the surface of the sample. Then the reactor was cooled down to 100 °C under the same He flow. The NH3 was then pulsed into the reactor at 100 °C for 1 h, and the excess of ammonia was removed under 20 mL min−1 He flow for 4 h. Next, the TPD-NH3 analysis was performed by heating the reactor from 100 to 700 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under He flow of 20 mL min−1, while the TCD response was recorded. 2.3.5 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) For morphological evaluation of the synthesized catalysts, a JEM-1230 (JEOL) transmission electron microscope (TEM) with a filament thermionic emission source of lanthanum hexaboride (LaB6) was utilized. The acceleration voltage of the electron beam was set at 80 kV, and the Gatan Ultrascan 1000XP was used to adjust the electron beam. The samples were finely powdered and dispersed in methanol; followed by a mild sonication for 10 min. Then, a drop of the prepared solution (≈5 μL) was attentively placed on a Formvar film coated nickel grid (200 mesh) and dried at room temperature in the air atmosphere. The histogram analysis of TEM micrographs were acquired by measuring at least 100 individual particles using the ImageJ software. 2.3.6 High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) A UHPLC (UltiMate 3000 Dionex) coupled with a UV (Thermo SCIENTIFIC Dionex UltiMate 3000) equipped with variable wavelength detector was used for analysis of liquid samples containing triglycerides (TG), diglycerides (DG) and monoglycerides (MG). The eluent solvents were acetonitrile, hexane, and isopropanol (HPLC grade – Fisher Scientific) set at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min−1 (the gradient elution mode was chosen during the analysis). AcclaimTM 120, C18, 5 μm, 120 A, 4.6 × 100 mm column was used for separation. To completely drain the injected liquids, the injected volume and the measurement time were respectively adjusted to 10 μl and 60 min. The peak identifications were done by comparing the recorded peaks with those of prepared standards using mixture containing known amount of canola oil in 2-propanol, 99.5% HPLC grade, provided by Sigma-Aldrich (CAS no.67-63-0). The analysis was repeated three times for each sample. 2.3.7 Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) The analysis was performed using a Thermo ScientificTM ultra-trace GC ITQ-900 ion trap mass spectrometer and a DB-5 ms 30 m, 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm column (Agilent) using a flame ionization detector (FID). The Xcalibur™ Software version 2.1 was used for peak identification and concentration determination using standard analytical solution (ASTM® D2887 quantitative calibration solution, Supelco) providing the detailed distribution of the components. The protocol used for the analysis was as follows: The samples were diluted (volume: 1 μl) with CS2, GC grade, (Sigma-Aldrich, CAS no. 75-15-0). The temperature of the GC oven was adjusted at 70 °C for 30 s to reach equilibrium. Then, the column temperature was raised with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 to 300 °C and maintained at this temperature for 15 min. The temperature of FID detector and the MS source were set at 220 and 200 °C respectively, and 50–650 m/z scan spectra were recorded. Between two injections, the column temperature was raised to 350 °C and kept at this temperature for 10 min letting all components elute. Each injection was performed three times. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Nitrogen adsorption-desorption analysis The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and the pore size distribution curves of γ-alumina support and the nickel catalysts are presented in Fig. 1 . As can be seen, the catalysts synthesized by sol-gel method exhibited a type IV isotherm with H2 hysteresis loop. The presence of capillary condensation step along with the presence of a defined plateau region at higher relative pressure (P/P0) revealed the mesoporous nature of the catalysts. γ-alumina samples show type IV isotherm with H2 type hysteresis loop slightly shifted to H3, representing materials with fairly narrow pore size distribution and interconnected cylindrical pore morphology [38]. The IMP-10% catalyst showed type IV isotherm with an H3 type hysteresis loop without any plateau region due to any adsorption limitation at high relative pressure corresponding to the slit-shaped mesostructured pores of this sample [39]. The differences between the hysteresis loops of the sol-gel and impregnated catalysts are related to the different methods of catalyst preparation. In the one-pot sol-gel synthesis method, the mesoporous structure is formed in the presence of nickel, whereas for samples prepared via incipient wet impregnation, the nickel is deposited in the mesoporous channels of the synthesized γ-alumina support that is in good agreement with the results obtained from XRD, and TEM (presented below in Figs. 2 and 4, respectively). It should be noted that the PSD curves are positioned in the range of about 4–15 nm illustrating the mesoporous nature of the catalysts according to IUPAC classification. Detailed textural characteristics of samples are listed in Table 1 . As can be seen in Table 1, it is clear that increasing the incorporated nickel content from 5% wt. up to 20% wt. led to a continuous reduction in the surface area and pore volume in sol-gel derived samples that are in agreement with previous studies [34,40]. The SBET and Vt of IMP-10% are 32.2% and 17.5% higher than those of SG-10% catalyst due to different synthesis method. A detailed description of the γ-alumina was reported in our previous work [14]. 3.2 X-ray diffraction (XRD) The XRD patterns of Ni-based catalysts are presented in Fig. 2 . The profiles of diffraction lines are rather asymmetric revealing a homogeneous distribution of metal species. In the non-reduced state, two nickel species could be observed: NiO formed on the surface of γ-alumina or incorporated with Al2O3 in the form of NiAl2O4 spinel-like species. Under similar preparation conditions, the amount of metal loading affects the formation of these different phase types [41]. As observed in Fig. 2, the alumina sample shows the presence of γ-alumina phase (Fd3m cubic crystal structure) with diffraction peaks of (400) at 2θ ≈ 46.0° and (440) at 2θ ≈ 66.8° which correspond to aluminum oxide (JCPDS No. 29-0063). The IMP-10% XRD patterns show the peaks of γ-alumina with additional three diffraction peaks located at 2θ ≈ 43, and 63° which are respectively related to (200), and (220) planes of NiO with Fm3m cubic crystal structure (JCPDS No. 04-0835), showing the presence of NiO phase for this sample. No characteristic peak of metallic Ni was observed for any non-reduced catalyst samples [42]. For SG-5%, three minor broad peaks are detected at 2θ ≈ 37, 45, 66° which are mainly ascribed to NiAl2O4 with Fd3m cubic crystal structure (JCPDS No. 81-0716). These peaks are extremely weak for SG-5%, however, they are more clearly observed at higher nickel contents (above 10%) [43]. The γ-alumina phase was not observed at 10% nickel, and the NiAl2O4 phase was formed after diffusion of nickel into the amorphous alumina phase. The broader diffraction pattern of SG-5% indicates that the Ni particles were highly dispersed in this alumina phase. Further increase in nickel content (SG-10%) results in a slight shift of the γ-alumina peak at ≈ 66° to a lower 2θ value suggesting an increase in NiAl2O4 phase. No diffraction peak associated with NiO phase (2θ ≈ 37, 43, and 63°) was observed for SG-5% and SG-10% samples revealing that nickel was well dispersed and incorporated into the alumina structure through the one-pot sol-gel assisted EISA strategy [34]. Comparing the XRD patterns of IMP-10% with SG-10% shows that the NiO phase is only observed for IMP-10%, revealing that employment of the one-pot sol-gel approach, hindered the formation of large NiO species on the surface of SG-10% catalyst and stabilized nickel in the alumina phase. For SG-15% and SG-20% samples, the peaks at 2θ ≈ 37, 43, and 63° are respectively attributed to (111), (200), and (220) planes of NiO phase. The similar intensity of these peaks in the XRD patterns of IMP-10% and SG-15% indicates the sol-gel method was more efficient in the NiAl2O4 spinel formation. The peaks are sharpened at SG-20% sample, pointing out that further increase in the Ni content led to the formation of large NiO crystals on the surface, and the excess Ni did not diffuse into the alumina framework. The average crystallite sizes roughly calculated from (200) plane of NiO were 17.9, 16.9, 23.3, and 28.6 nm for IMP-10%, SG-10%-WT, SG-15%, and SG-20%, respectively. The NiO crystallite sizes of SG-5% and SG-10% were not estimated due to lack of XRD peaks associated with NiO phase for these samples. The NiO crystallite size of IMP-10% and SG-10%-WT were comparable suggesting the stabilizing effect of P123 polymeric template on the incorporation of nickel in the mesostructured framework. Further increase in the nickel content (SG-15% and SG-20%) led to the formation of larger NiO crystallites which is in accordance with the larger nickel particle size on the surface of the catalyst in TEM micrographs presented in Fig. 5. It seems that there is a metal loading concentration above which the nickel species start accumulating as NiO on the surface of the catalysts. The lattice parameters of the catalysts are presented in Table 2 . The ionic radius of alumina is smaller than that of nickel, and thus the addition of nickel leads to a lattice expansion [44,45]. As can be seen in Table 2 the lattice parameters of the γ-alumina phase increased from sample SG-5% to SG-10% which shows that the amount of nickel incorporated in the γ-alumina lattice was increased. For SG-15% and SG-20% samples, due to the small intensity and overlapping of the alumina peaks, refinement technique was employed, which made the rough estimation of the lattice parameters possible. This rough calculation and the lattice parameter values of these two samples let us to believe that further increase in nickel content does not notably affect the lattice parameter resulting in the approximately same lattice parameters for SG-10, 15 and 20% samples. It can thus be concluded that at concentrations above 10% wt. nickel, the Ni species were not well-introduced into the alumina lattice and accumulated on the surface of the mesoporous structure in the form of nickel oxide. Comparing the lattice parameter of SG-10% and SG-10%-WT proves the efficiency of the EISA method for introduction of nickel in the mesoporous framework. The lattice parameter of IMP-10% is nearly the same as that of γ-alumina showing that nickel species are not incorporated into the γ-alumina lattice. This indicates that nickel species are present in the form of NiO on the walls of the alumina porous structure which is in accordance with obtained XRD patterns (Fig. 2). All studies reported below were therefore performed using catalysts loaded with 10% wt. of nickel. The XRD patterns of SG-10%-R and IMP-10%-R samples show the diffraction peaks locate at 2θ ≈ 44, 52, 76° which is attributed to Ni° with Fm3m cubic crystal structure (JCPDS No. 04-0850). To be more precise, the same sample contents reduced in the reaction chamber of the XPS device were used for the XRD analysis using a Poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) sample holder (due to the small amount of samples). Thus, the broad peaks in reduced sample patterns (2θ ≈ 10–25°) are likely from the sample holder. A higher reduction is achieved under the same conditions for sample IMP-10% compared to SG-10% considering the same XRD pattern counts scales and the sharper Ni° peaks of IMP-10% compared to SG-10%. This could be due to the presence of more accessible reducible nickel species on the IMP-10% sample. 3.3 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) XPS spectra of SG-10%-WT in oxidic form and SG-10% and IMP-10% in oxidic and reduced forms are presented in Fig. 3 . To avoid re-oxidation of the reduced samples, the catalysts were reduced in-situ in the reaction chamber of the XPS spectrometer by increasing the temperature from 25 to 600 °C under H2 flow of 60 mL min−1, with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and 3 h soaking time. As depicted in Fig. 3, the Ni2p spectra of oxidic SG-10%, SG-10%-WT and IMP-10% samples consist of Ni2p3/2 (respectively positioned at ca. 855.7 ± 0.1, 855.8 ± 0.1 and 855.8 ± 0.1 eV) and Ni2p1/2 peaks (positioned respectively at ca. 873.1 ± 0.1, 873.2 ± 0.1 and 873.3 ± 0.1 eV). It is normally not possible to clearly distinguish the NiO and NiAl2O4 phases with XPS, due to the similarity of their binding energy values. Generally, the reported binding energies for NiAl2O4 are slightly higher (about 0.5 eV) than those of NiO [46]. Therefore it might be hypothesized that the Ni2p3/2 lines observed at 858.1, 857.1 and 857.3 eV in the deconvolution of these peaks belong to Ni in NiAl2O4 for samples SG-10%WT, SG-10%, and IMP-10% respectively. This would be in agreement with the observation of this phase by XRD patterns of SG-10%WT and SG-10%. The XRD patterns of IMP-10% do not show the lines of NiAl2O4, clearly indicating that this phase would be highly dispersed in this sample. The XPS derived surface atomic fractions values are presented in Table 3 . The Ni/Al atomic ratio is lower in SG-10% compared to IMP-10% and SG-10%-WT samples (by about 27.4% and 25.6%, respectively). This reveals the effectiveness of evaporation-induced self-assembly in incorporating nickel species in the mesoporous framework in addition to the role of constructing the mesoporous structure. Both reduced samples show lower Ni/Al ratio than their non-reduced counterparts. These results are in good agreement with lattice parameter order of 0.7939 > 0.8002 > 0.8034 for IMP-10%, SG-10%-WT, and SG-10% presented in Table 2, which also suggests a higher incorporation of Ni ions in the alumina lattice of SG-10%. All samples show higher Ni/Al atomic ratio values than the Ni/Al atomic ratio value of the bulk (≈0.051) which would result from some surface segregation [47]. The XPS spectra of reduced samples of SG-10%-R and IMP-10%-R are also presented in Fig. 3. After reduction, peaks approximatively centered at binding energies of 852.6 ± 0.1 and 869.6 ± 0.1 eV are manifested for sample SG-10%-R. For IMP-10%-R sample, these peaks are positioned at binding energies of 852.5 ± 0.1 and 869.8 ± 0.1 eV. These peaks are respectively attributed to Ni2p3/2 and Ni2p1/2 in the metallic state (Ni°) [25,48]. Just like oxidized samples, SG-10%-R, and IMP-10%-R samples have peaks centered at ca. 856.3 ± 0.1 and 855.7 ± 0.1 eV and 873.8 ± 0.1 and 873.2 ± 0.1 eV respectively, which are attributed to Ni2p3/2 and Ni2p1/2 lines of NiO. The coexistence of Ni2+and Ni° species for both reduced samples revealed that, under the applied conditions, the reduction is only partial. These results are in good agreement with the XRD patterns of the reduced samples. The percentages of Ni° peak area calculated from the deconvolution of the Ni2p lines are 32.1% and 28.8% for SG-10%-R and IMP-10%-R, respectively. The atomic fraction of Ni sensed by XPS in SG-10%-R and IMP-10%-R are equal to 2.28% and 4.04% respectively (see Table 3). Thus, the overall metallic nickel at the surface of IMP-10%-R compared to SG-10%-R is ≈ 1.59 times higher. This could explain the higher conversion of triglycerides reached with the impregnated catalyst. 3.4 Temperature programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD) The NH3-TPD of the pure mesoporous γ-alumina, IMP-10% and SG-10% are illustrated in Fig. 4 ,. Mesoporous γ-alumina exhibits two peaks approximately centered at the temperature below 300 °C corresponding to the presence of weak and moderate acidic sites and between 400 and 500 °C corresponding to strongly adsorbed NH3 [49]. IMP-10% and SG-10% samples showed very weak acidic strength and acid site density. In the presence of Ni atoms, the NH3-TPD profile became almost flat, showing a reduction in the surface acidity of IMP-10% caused by the filling of γ-alumina mesoporous channels, thus inhibiting the contact of ammonia with the support which is in agreement with the N2 adsorption-desorption (Table 1) and XRD analysis (Fig. 2) [50]. This acidity reduction is more prominent for sample SG-10% than IMP-10% which could possibly be due to the formation of Al2O4 phase, also confirmed by XRD (see Fig. 2). 3.5 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) TEM micrographs and particle size distributions of the catalysts are illustrated in Fig. 5, to investigate the effect of metal species and various synthesis methods on the morphological properties of the catalysts. The average particle size of the Ni bearing phase measured from TEM micrographs of sol-gel derived samples are also presented. Nickel particles are perceived in the form of black spots. TEM micrographs of the catalysts synthesized by the sol-gel method provide the evidence that nickel particles are fairly dispersed, and the mesoporous structure is maintained which is also confirmed by BET (Fig. 1). It can be found that increasing the metal content led to an increase in the particle size which is also detectable by a reduction in the surface area of samples from SG-5% to SG-20% (see Table 1). At high nickel content, in samples SG-15% and SG-20% nickel particles agglomeration is observed. As can be seen in Fig. 5a, SG-5% has a narrow particle size distribution centered at approximately 2.6 nm. Further increase in nickel content up to 10% wt. brings an increase to 5.8 nm in the average particle diameter (Fig. 5b). Due to the incorporation of metal species into the alumina support, the contrast between the particle and the alumina structure is not high leading to some inaccuracies in the detection of particles from TEM micrographs. Considering this error, these results are in accordance with the XRD patterns of sample SG-5% and SG-10% (Fig. 2) revealing a small particle size and uniform dispersion of nickel in the mesoporous structure. For SG-15% and SG-20% samples (Fig. 4c and d), particle growth and agglomeration were observed. The roughly measured average particle sizes of about 13.8 and 23.9 nm are obtained which follows the same trend of the crystallite sizes calculated from Scherrer's equation from XRD patterns. These observations are in accordance with the presence of sharp peaks associated with NiO phase in XRD patterns of SG-15% and SG-20% samples (Fig. 2) and confirmed the large grain size of these samples. As can be seen in Fig. 5, less homogeneity is observed in the TEM micrograph of sample SG-10%-WT (Fig. 5e) compared to SG-10% (Fig. 5b). The black agglomerated area is possibly formed due to the lack of the P123 polymeric template in the synthesis step. The TEM micrograph of the mesostructured γ-alumina and the IMP-10% samples are respectively shown in Fig. 4f and g. The γ-alumina support shows long range mesopores which are partially filled by dispersed nickel while introducing metal species via impregnation method. The presence of mesopores is evident even after nickel loading. These observations are in line with N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm of the IMP-10% sample presented in Fig. 1. 3.6 Hydrotreatment over the prepared catalysts To evaluate the effects of the two different synthesis methods on the catalytic properties, sample SG-10%-R, and IMP-10%-R were chosen as catalysts for the hydrotreatment of canola oil. The conversion of the triglycerides up to 600 min over catalysts are presented in Fig. 6 , left. The liquid conversion over IMP-10%-R for TOS of 150 and 300 min is 81.5% and 76.8% respectively. For the first 300 min of the reaction, the liquid conversion over IMP-10%-R is higher than that over SG-10% sample. This could be due to the higher surface area of reduced nickel on the surface of IMP-10%-R compared to SG-10%-R (confirmed with XRD and XPS analysis). At TOS of 300 to 450 min, IMP-10%-R lost its activity, and the liquid conversion decreased sharply and reached about 37.4%. After this sharp reduction, the conversion remained relatively stable and reached 30.9% at the TOS of 600 min. This fast deactivation could probably be related to the adsorption of the unsaturated triglycerides on the surface of the catalyst, leading to coke formation on the acidic sites of the catalyst or due to the sintering of the nickel species on the γ-alumina surface [51]. For SG-10%-R, a continuous decline of the conversion started at TOS of 150 min (68.6%) up to 600 min (54.0%). The lower conversion of SG-10%-R could be due to the fewer accessible reduced nickel on this sample compared to IMP-10%-R. The confinement of the nickel species in the mesoporous framework of SG-10%-R reduced the activity through blocking some metallic nickel sites. On the other hand, it also prevents the fast deactivation of this catalyst. This lower deactivation rate is gained at the cost of a reduced catalytic activity. The transformation of canola oil to green diesel could be executed either by HDO or DCO-DCO2 pathways. If the reaction goes through HDO, the n-alkane products have the same number of carbon atoms as that the corresponding fatty acid of the triglycerides molecules. If the reaction goes through DCO-DCO2, the resulting n-alkane has one carbon less than the corresponding fatty acids. Hence, the ratios of C17/C18 and C15/C16 show the selectivity over HDO and DCO-DCO2. Fig. 6 (right) displays the C15/C16 and C17/C18 as functions of TOS. Both catalysts favored the DCO-DCO2 pathway in the TOS range of 150–600 min which corresponds to a lower hydrogen consumption. The two ratios are slightly reduced from 150 to 600 min of TOS over both catalysts. The 17/C18 ratios are similar over SG-10%-R and IMP-10%-R. The C15/C16 ratio is higher for IMP-10%-R compared to SG-10%-R, indicating a higher tendency of IMP-10%-R catalyst for the DCO-DCO2 pathways on shorter chain fatty acids. The liquid normal alkane chain length distributions of the hydrotreated products over IMP-10%-R and SG-10%-R are presented in Fig. 7 . The three represented fractions of C9-14, C15-C18, and C19-C30 are respectively considered as cracked, diesel, and oligomerized fractions. As can be seen, up to TOS of 300 min, IMP-10%-R (left) shows higher cracked components compared to SG-10%-R (right). This could be caused by a higher acidity of this sample due to the presence of the γ-alumina structure (see Fig. 4). From TOS of 150 min to 600 min, a reduction of about 7.5% in cracked products, and a 4.4 times increase in oligomerized product was observed for IMP-10%-R (Fig. 7 left). These oligomerized products might be generated as coke precursors and their increased fraction are correlated with decreasing conversion. Interestingly, the rapid deactivation observed between 300 and 450 min is accompanied by an abrupt change in both C9-C14 and C19-C30 ratios (Fig. 7, down). The evolution with conversion (or TOS) of these two ratios follows the same trends (at different values) for the two catalysts. IMP-10%-R shows higher cracking activity (C9–C14) suggesting a higher surface concentration of acid sites. Although the diesel fraction values are higher for IMP-10%-R catalyst, the lower conversion of IMP-10%-R at TOS above 450 min indictates the poor stability of this catalyst. A lower acidity of SG-10%-R due to the formation of NiAl2O4 spinel-like phase is in agreement with literature data [51]. The opposite trends of C9-C14 and C19-C30 as functions of conversion, suggest that the two processes of cracking and oligomerization are not occurring on the same sites with the two kinds of sites being affected differently upon deactivation. To conclude, the diesel/cracking and oligomerized products decreased and increased respectively over both catalysts. Moreover, higher stability observed for SG-10%-R as a result of smooth deactivation trend over the studied reaction time range. The SG-10%-R catalyst shows better stability during hydrotreatment which may be due to the confinement of active metals caused by the employed sol-gel method. 4 Conclusions Nickel alumina catalysts were prepared through the two methods of impregnation and sol-gel techniques. The results revealed that a bulk nickel oxide phase is present on impregnated catalysts, whereas an aluminate phase is formed by sol-gel. This work confirms that triglycerides hydrotreatment in a continuous down-flow reactor is possible to run over a non-sulfided metal catalyst supported on alumina. The catalyst preparation method is shown to be of importance for the catalytic properties in this reaction. The sol-gel technique involving evaporation-induced self-assembly was shown to yield more stable properties than the conventional γ-alumina impregnation method. This difference between the two materials was associated with the formation of a NiAl2O4 phase and a less acidic support.
