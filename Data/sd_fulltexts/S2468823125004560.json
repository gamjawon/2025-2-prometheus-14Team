The fields covered are: 1) Heterogeneous catalysis including immobilized catalysts 2) Homogeneous catalysis including organocatalysis, organometallic catalysis, and biocatalysis 3) Theoretical aspects of catalysis The Journal also publishes timely reviews of specialized topics within the scope outlined above; however, prospective authors must obtain preliminary approval from the Editor-in-Chief before preparing a review article. Accepted manuscripts of exceptional quality and substantial interest to the readership may be selected by Editors to feature in the â€˜Editors Choiceâ€™ section of the Journal. It is expected that catalyst activity be appropriately conveyed. Thus, homogeneous systems are ideally characterized by kinetic analysis from which macro- or microscopic rate constants can be presented. Turnover numbers, turnover frequencies, and/or specific activities should be reported as appropriate. For heterogeneous systems, activities should ideally be expressed in turnover frequencies per site or at least per unit area of active component measured using appropriate methods. Extensive use of percent conversion should be avoided. Contributions that do not fall within the above aims and scope will be rejected at the editorial level. Examples are papers that are limited to: 1) Routine preparation and characterization of catalytic materials 2) Routine synthetic organic applications of catalysis Since the scopes of the Elsevier journals Molecular Catalysis, Applied Catalysis A: General, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, and Catalysis Communications are complementary, an appropriate submission to each journal could be borderline, in which case the advice of another Editor will be sought, possibly redirecting the submission to either Applied Catalysis A: General, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, or Catalysis Communications (for letters) with the author(s)â€™s agreement.

Manuscript submission Online Submission of Articles. Submission to this journal proceeds entirely on-line via http://ees.elsevier.com/mcat. You will be guided stepwise through the creation and uploading of the various files. The system automatically converts source files to a single Adobe Acrobat PDF version of the article, which is used in the peer-review process. Please note that even though manuscript source files are converted to PDF at submission for the review process, these source files are needed for further processing after acceptance. All correspondence,including notification of the Editorâ€™s decision and requests for revision, takes place by e-mail and via the Authorâ€™s homepage, removing the need for a hard-copy paper trail. Submission to this journal proceeds totally on-line. Authors can upload their article as a LaTeX, MicrosoftÂ® (MS) WordÂ®,WordPerfectÂ®, PostScript or AdobeÂ® AcrobatÂ® PDF document via the â€œHomeâ€� page of this journal (http://www.elsevier.com/locate/mcat), where they will also find a detailed description on its use. The system generates an Adobe Acrobat PDF version of the article which is used for the reviewing process. Authors, Reviewers and Editors send and receive all correspondence by e-mail and via the web so no paper correspondence is necessary. Proofs When your manuscript is received by the Publisher it is considered to be in its final form. Proofs are not to be regarded as â€˜â€˜draftsâ€™â€™. One set of page proofs in PDF format will be sent by e-mail to the corresponding Author, to be checked for typesetting/editing. No changes in, or additions to, the accepted (and subsequently edited) manuscript will be allowed at this stage. Proofreading is solely the authorsâ€™ responsibility. A form with queries from the copyeditor may accompany your proofs. Please answer all queries and make any corrections or additions required. Any amendments will be incorporated and the final article will then be published online as an Article in Press on ScienceDirect www.sciencedirect.com Articles in Press will be removed once the paper has been assigned to an issue and the issue has been compiled. All questions arising after acceptance of the manuscript, especially those relating to proofs, should be directed to: Molecular Catalysis, Elsevier Ireland Limited, Elsevier House, Brookvale Place, East Park, Shannon, Co.

Higher C 2 -C 4 olefins selectivity at the expense of paraffinâ€™s selectivity was the most noticeable point for the plasma-assisted catalysts. sequently edited) manuscript will be allowed at this stage.
