Graphical abstract Ternary NiCoFe-layered double hydroxide (LDH) hollow polyhedron (HP) exhibited excellent OER performance with overpotential of 276 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH, surpassing solid NiCoFe-LDH sheet powder (SP), Fe-free NiCo-LDH HP and commercially available IrO2. Image, graphical abstract Keywords Layered double hydroxide Hollow Oxygen evolution reaction With exhaustion of fossil fuels and the deterioration of global environment, widespread and intensive researches have been concentrated on clean and sustainable alternative energy sources, such as metal-air batteries [1], fuel cells [2] and water splitting devices [3]. Electrocatalytic oxidation of water to O2 (oxygen evolution reaction, OER) is a vital chemical process involved in energy storage and conversion from renewable sources in form of molecular fuels such as H2 via water electrolysis, which has attracted a great amount of research efforts in the past few years [4,5]. Nowadays, RuO2 and IrO2 are widely used as typical excellent OER electrocatalysts. However, their high-cost and scarce nature restricts the broadly commercial application of those materials [6,7]. Hence, there is an urgent demand to develop low cost, highly efficient, and superb stable OER catalysts. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are a sort of two-dimensional materials with diverse chemical composition which can be easily regulated, therefore are employed in a wild range of applications, such as heterogeneous catalysis [8], sensor [9], drug delivery [10], and electrochemistry [11–13]. Rational design to tailor their chemical compositions, shapes and topo-structures has attracted much attention in recent years [14,15]. Among them, hollow structured LDHs, with the merits of low density, large specific surface area, small diffusion blockage and short diffusion pathway, exhibit promising abilities to gain enhanced performance and new properties. For example, hollow LDH microspheres with tunable inner architecture were demonstrated to show efficient activity in ethanol electrooxidation [16]. Hollow LDH nanocages obtained using metal-organic framework (MOF) as templates showed excellent pseudocapacitance due to their unique hollow structures [17]. Herein, we report a facile strategy to synthesize ternary NiCoFe-LDH HP with highly efficient OER performance. Uniform cobalt 2-methylimidazole (ZIF-67) polyhedrons are utilized as the template which is in situ transformed into hollow structured NiCoFe-LDH nanoparticles by a simple etching and growth process in the ethanol solution of nickel nitrate and iron nitrate. In particular, benefiting from the hollow structure with fully exposed active sites and easy electron/ion transport kinetics, the obtained NiCoFe-LDH HP exhibits outstanding OER performance with an overpotential of 276 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH, outperforming solid NiCoFe-LDH sheet powder (SP), NiCo-LDH HP and commercial IrO2. NiCoFe-LDH HP is synthesized via a facile two-step self-templated in situ transformation strategy, where MOFs are etched to form hollow structures and in situ generate LDH on the surface of MOF simultaneously. Typically, pre-synthesized Co-containing MOF (ZIF-67) as the self-template was dispersed in a mixed ethanol solution of nickel nitrate and iron nitrate. The coordination bonds between cobalt and 2-methylimidazole were broken gradually by the protons generated from the hydrolysis of nickel ions and iron ions, with the release of cobalt ions [18]. Ternary NiCoFe-LDH in situ formed on the surface of ZIF-67 polyhedrons along with the destruction of the inner part of ZIF-67 polyhedrons, resulting in the formation of NiCoFe-LDH hollow structures. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) were applied to study the morphologies of the samples. The pre-synthesized ZIF-67 polyhedrons exhibit a uniform morphology with a regular size of about 1 µm (Fig. 1 a, b). A smooth surface and the solid nature of the polyhedrons can also be observed. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of ZIF-67 polyhedrons is in good agreement with that of simulated one (Fig. S1), confirming the formation of pure phase ZIF-67 polyhedrons. After reacting with a mixed ethanol solution of nickel nitrate and iron nitrate at RT, the solid ZIF-67 polyhedrons are converted into ternary NiCoFe-LDH hollow structures (Fig. 1c–e). Typical SEM image of the as-formed NiCoFe-LDH HP demonstrates that the product still kept the polyhedron morphology and the size of the precursor ZIF-67, but their surfaces were roughened, indicating the formation of new phase of nanoparticles at the surfaces (Fig. 1c). The TEM images unambiguously reveal their hollow nature, as confirmed from their low contrast in Fig. 1(d, e). The shell thickness of the NiCoFe-LDH HP was about ∼70 nm (Fig. 1e). The XRD pattern of NiCoFe-LDH HP shows obvious peaks at 2θ of 11.6°, 34.8° and 60.8°, which match well with the (003), (009) and (110) plane of LDH (JCPDS No. 41–1428) respectively (Fig. 1h), indicating the resulted product is LDH. Moreover, the high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of NiCoFe-LDH HP (Fig. 1f) shows a lattice spacing of 0.25 nm, well identified to the (009) plane of LDH, further proving that the NiCoFe-LDH HP sample is composed of LDH. The energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum and elemental mapping of NiCoFe-LDH HP exhibits the present of the Ni, Co, Fe elements, which distributed uniformly over the whole NiCoFe-LDH HP (Figs. S2, 1 g), further confirming the ternary nature of the sample. The molar ratio of Ni/Co/Fe is 4.7/2.3/1, determined by the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) (Table S1). In order to further study the formation process of hollow LDH, the morphology evolution upon time was investigated. The results showed that voids are formed within the polyhedrons after 15 min, which gradually enlarged with reaction time until hollow structures are obtained after 1 h (Fig. S3). The XPS was used to figure out the valence states of elements and surface composition of the NiCoFe-LDH HP. As shown in Fig. 2 (a), the survey spectrum proves the presence of C, O, N, Ni, Fe, Co. The existences of C, N, and O should account for the intercalation anions between the layer of LDH which consist of carbonate and nitrate. The high-resolution XPS of Ni in Fig. 2(b) consist of four peaks at 855.9 eV for Ni 2p 3/2, 873.5 eV for Ni 2p 1/2 and two satellite peaks at 861.5 and 879.9 eV, respectively, confirming the valence state of Ni is +2 [19]. As shown in Fig. 2(c), the peaks at 781.1 and 782.7 eV represent the existence of Co2+ and Co3+, respectively [20]. The XPS spectrum of Fe shows two broad peaks at 724.5 and 714.1 eV, represented for Fe 2p 1/2 and Fe 2p 3/2, respectively, confirming the +3 oxidation state of Fe [21]. These two peaks are broad due to the relatively low Fe amount in the NiCoFe-LDH HP. Evidenced from the above characterizations, we can draw conclusion that the product is hollow polyhedrons whose shell is composed of small NiCoFe-LDH nanoparticles. The NiCoFe-LDH HP has a BET surface area of 77 m2 g−1, much larger than that of the solid NiCoFe-LDH SP (34 m2 g−1) (Fig. S4). Mesopores with an average diameter of 3.8 nm can be observed in the NiCoFe-LDH HP, further demonstrating the hollow feature of NiCoFe-LDH HP (Fig. S5). Hollow materials possess the merits of low density, large specific surface area, small diffusion blockage, and short diffusion pathway, and its hollow void can work as reactors to confine reactants and thus improve their catalytic efficiency. The mesopores of the NiCoFe-LDH HP will assistant the transport of oxygen as well as electrolyte. Besides, the hollow structure could facilitate the volumetric change in the electrochemical process, which make NiCoFe-LDH HP promising candidate for OER. Therefore, the OER electrochemical performance of the ternary NiCoFe-LDH HP was carried out in 1 M KOH through a typical three-electrode method. The solid NiCoFe-LDH SP (Fig. S6a, b), Fe-free NiCo-LDH HP (Fig. S6c, d), Ni-free CoFe-LDH HP (Fig. S9c), and commercial IrO2 which shows irregular particle shape with an average size of about 200 nm (Fig. S7), were taken as references. The linear scanning voltage (LSV) plots are shown in Fig. 3 (a). The NiCoFe-LDH HP shows an onset potential of 1.506 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm−2, which is greatly enhanced than solid NiCoFe-LDH SP (1.571 V vs. RHE), Fe-free NiCo-LDH HP (1.576 V vs. RHE), Ni-free CoFe-LDH HP (1.545 V vs. RHE), and even commercial IrO2 (1.558 V vs. RHE). The overpotential of NiCoFe-LDH HP is about 276 mV at 10 mA cm−2, and this is much better than NiCoFe-LDH SP (341 mV), Fe-free NiCo-LDH HP (346 mV), Ni-free CoFe-LDH HP (315 mV vs. RHE), commercial IrO2 (326 mV) and reported LDHs (Table S2) [22–28]. At 100 mA cm−2, the overpotential of NiCoFe-LDH HP is just 332 mV, similar with that of commercial IrO2 at 10 mA cm−2, evidencing the extraordinary OER performance of NiCoFe-LDH HP at high current density. Further, NiCoFe-LDH HP samples with different size and Ni/Co/Fe ratio were also prepared to study the size and composition effect to the OER performance. The size of NiCoFe-LDH HP-L and NiCoFe-LDH HP-S were 1200 nm and 500 nm respectively, while the overpotentials of them were 322 mV and 298 mV respectively (Fig. S8). The Ni/Co/Fe ratio was varied by changing the Ni (NO3)2·6H2O, Co (NO3)2·6H2O and Fe (NO3)3·9H2O used in the preparation from 19:0:1 to 14:5:1, 9.5:9.5:1 and 0:19:1, which exhibited overpotentials of 331, 328 and 315 mV, respectively (Fig. S9). These results indicated that the structure, composition and size of the electrocatalyst have significant influences on the final electrochemical performance. The Tafel plots, which are usually carried out to study the electrochemical kinetics, are shown in Fig. 3(b). The NiCoFe-LDH HP gains a Tafel slope of 56 mV dec−1, much smaller than NiCoFe-LDH SP (91 mV dec−1), NiCo-LDH HP (111 mV dec−1) and comparable to that of IrO2 (54 mV dec−1). The Tafel slopes of NiCoFe-LDH and IrO2 (<54 mV dec−1) suggested that the determining step of the OER processes catalyzed by NiCoFe-LDH HP and IrO2 are four electrons transfer, while the determining step for NiCoFe-LDH SP and NiCo-LDH HP are three electrons transfer [19]. The increased multiple electrons transfer process indicated faster kinetics during the OER, and is a sign of better electrocatalyst. The Fe sites have a much stronger binding with hydroxide group against dissociation in water than Ni and Co sites in NiCoFe LDH, so that more electrons would be involved in the electrochemical process, resulting in a higher OER activity. The EIS analysis was performed to take a further insight of the enhanced electrochemical performance. The solution resistance (R S) can be obtained from the high-frequency region directly, and the charge-transfer resistance (R CT) can be obtained from the low-frequency and high-frequency by calculation of the semicircle radius. According to the Nyquist plots (Fig. 3c), the R CT of NiCoFe-LDH HP is much smaller than that of NiCoFe-LDH SP, NiCo-LDH HP and IrO2, proving that the NiCoFe-LDH HP has the best conductivity and the fastest electron-charge transfer speed. The poorer performance for IrO2 could be attributed to the bigger R CT. The bigger charge transfer resistances of NiCoFe-LDH SP and NiCo-LDH HP prove the advantage of hollow structure and ternary LDH composition in electron-charge transfer. In addition, the electrochemical surface area of NiCoFe-LDH HP is 7.4 mF cm−2 as determined by EDLC method, nearly 1.4 times of that for NiCoFe-LDH SP (5.4 mF cm−2) (Fig. S10), indicating that NiCoFe-LDH HP can provide more electrochemical active site and thus better performance. Lastly, the stability of the NiCoFe-LDH HP is investigated at 1.506 V vs. RHE. Remarkably, there is no obvious current loss after 12 h testing. The morphology of the sample is well obtained after the stability test (Fig. 3d, inset), further indicating that excellent mechanical stability of the NiCoFe-LDH HP. All of the above results prove that the NiCoFe-LDH HP can be widely used as a cost-effective non-precious metal containing alternative for oxygen evolution reactions. To conclude, a novel self-templated in situ transformation strategy has been developed for the synthesis of ternary NiCoFe-LDH HP. In this synthetic approach, uniform ZIF-67 polyhedrons are used as template and transformed into hollow structured polyhedrons with the shell assembled by small LDH nanoparticles through a facile etching and deposition process. When evaluated as electrodes for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction, the NiCoFe-LDH HP showed a much lower onset potential and overpotential than solid NiCoFe-LDH SP, NiCo-LDH HP and commercially available catalyst IrO2. The extraordinary performance could be ascribed to the construction of hollow structure, which can expose abundant active sites and have an easy electron/ion transfer kinetics. This work could spark inspirations for rational design of hollow structures with improved performances for diverse applications.
