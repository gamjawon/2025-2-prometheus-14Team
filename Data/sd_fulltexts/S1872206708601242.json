DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(08)60124-2 An Interfacially Alloyed Pt^Ag Cathode Catalyst for the Electrochemical Reduction of Oxygen FENG Yuanyuan, MA Junhong, ZHANG Guirong, ZHAO Dan, XU Boqing* Innovative Catalysis Program, Key Laboratory of Organic Optoelectronics and Molecular Engineering, Department of Chemistry, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China Abstract: An interfacially alloyed Pt-on-Ag nanostructure (Pt0.5^Ag-B, atomic Pt/Ag ratio being 0.5) was loaded on Vulcan XC-72 carbon to make a cathode Pt0.5^Ag-B/C catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The electrocatalytic performance of this Pt0.5^Ag-B/C catalyst was measured by reference to its unalloyed counterpart Pt0.5^Ag-A/C and E-TEK Pt/C catalysts. The intrinsic activity of Pt in the Pt0.5^Ag-B/C catalyst was identified to be twice that in the E-TEK Pt/C catalyst although the half-wave potentials (E1/2) of the ORR curves over both catalysts were the same. Compared with the unalloyed Pt0.5^Ag-A/C catalyst, the alloying at the Pt/Ag interface in the Pt0.5^Ag-B/C catalyst gave a more positive E1/2 and also a significantly higher mass-specific activity of Pt for ORR. Key words: nanostructure; interfacial alloy; cathode catalyst; platinum; silver; oxygen reduction reactionÇ‚ Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are con- sidered the preferred power sources of the future because of their highly efficient and environmentally friendly features. Platinum is currently the major component of the fuel cell cathode catalyst, but its high price and scarce resource greatly restrict the commercialization of PEMFCs. In recent years, great efforts have focused on reducing the amount of Pt or replacing it with non-precious metals or their compounds [1â€“5], such as metal porphyrins and metal phthalocyanines. Unfortunately, the catalytic activity of Pt-free catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is so far much lower than that of Pt catalysts. An effective approach to reduce the amount of Pt is to introduce a comparatively low-cost metal to the Pt to make a bimetallic alloy catalyst. The addition of a second metal could significantly enhance the intrinsic activity of Pt for ORR due to electronic and structural effects [6,7]. Stamenkovic and coworkers [8] reported that the (111) sur- face of a Pt3Ni alloy was 90 times more active for ORR than the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts. Recently, several series of nanostructured Ptm^M (m being the atomic Pt/M ratio, M = Au or Ag) catalysts, having Pt in different dispersion states, were obtained in our laboratory by depositing Pt onto colloidal Au or Ag particles [9,10]. De- pending on the size of the substrate M nanoparticles or the value of m, the dispersion state of Pt on M could change from a shell-like overlayer to two-dimensional rafts or subnanome- ter Pt-flecks with significantly enhanced Pt dispersion up to 100% for maximizing the utilization of Pt for electrocatalysis [9â€“13]. For the preparation of Pt^Ag catalysts, the precursor nature of Pt had an important influence on the interaction be- tween Pt and Ag. When K2PtIICl4 was used as the precursor, we obtained Ptm^Ag-A samples showing no interaction be- tween Pt and Ag. Distinct alloying at the Pt/Ag interfaces was detected in the Ptm^Ag-B nanostructures obtained by using K2PtIVCl6 as the precursor of Pt. Fine tuning of the composi- tion by changing m resulted in a suitably alloyed Pt0.5^Ag-B/C catalyst that showed remarkably higher catalytic activities for methanol and formic acid electrooxidation. The mass-specific activity (MSA) of Pt in this Pt0.5^Ag-B/C increased up to 5â€“8 times that of the unalloyed Ptm^Ag-A/C catalysts [10,13]. Our recent test in acidic as well as alkaline electrolytes shows that the interfacially alloyed Ptm^Ag-B/C samples could also be used as efficient catalysts for ORR. In order to better under- stand the influence of alloying at the Pt/Ag interface in Pt^Ag FENG Yuanyuan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(8): 776â€“779 nanostructures on ORR, we report here the electrocatalytic performance of Pt0.5^Ag-B/C in acidic and alkaline electro- lytes by comparison with its unalloyed counterpart Pt0.5^Ag-A/C (prepared from K2PtIICl4) and a commercial Pt/C catalyst. The preparation and structural characteristics of Pt0.5^Ag- A/C and Pt0.5^Ag-B/C samples have been reported previously [10,13]. Electrochemical measurements were carried out in a conventional three-electrode cell. A saturated calomel elec- trode (SCE) and a Pt wire (diameter = 1 mm) were used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. All potentials obtained in this work were referenced to the SCE standard. The working electrode was a rotating ring-disk electrode with a glass-carbon as the disk electrode (diameter = 5.61 mm) and Pt as the ring electrode (Pine Research Instrumentation, col- lection efficiency N = 0.37). Cyclic voltammograms and po- larization curves were obtained on a PAR 2273 Potentio- stats-Electrochemistry Workstation at room temperature. The working electrode was prepared as follows. A slurry of the catalyst was first made by sonicating a suspension of the car- bon-supported catalyst (5.0 mg) in isopropanol (1.0 ml). Then, 10 È�l of the suspension was transferred onto the disk elec- trode. After solvent evaporation at room temperature, 10 È�l 0.5% Nafion solution was casted to attach the catalyst. Figure 1 shows the cyclic voltammograms of Pt0.5^Ag-A/C and Pt0.5^Ag-B/C for ORR in 0.5 mol/L H2SO4 and 0.5 mol/L KOH solutions. The cathodic peak at 0.45 V and a couple of peaks at around 0.20 V in Fig. 1(a) were assigned to the re- duction of oxygen and the redox of Ag, respectively. The two cathodic peaks detected at â€“ 0.25 and â€“ 0.50 V in Fig. 1(b) were associated with the reduction of oxygen and oxidized Pt. The anodic oxidation peak observed at 0.30 V and the ca- thodic reduction peak at 0 V would indicate an occurrence of the following redox chemistry of Ag [14]: 2Ag + 2OHâ€“ Ä¼ Ag2O + H2O + 2eâ€“. The electrochemically active surface area (EAS) of Pt in the Pt0.5^Ag-B/C and Pt0.5^Ag-A/C samples was measured using the coulombic charge in the potential range of the hy- drogen adsorption/desorption region in N2-saturated electro- lytes, assuming that the exposed Ag surface was not active in the hydrogen adsorption/desorption [15]. The EAS of Pt0.5^Ag-B/C and Pt0.5^Ag-A/C were 58 and 45 m2/g-Pt in 0.5 mol/L H2SO4, and 73 and 49 m2/g-Pt in 0.5 mol/L KOH solu- tion, respectively. These numbers measured in the acidic elec- trolyte were slightly different from those reported previously [10,13] due to the difference in the preparation of the working electrodes. It is clearly seen that Pt0.5^Ag-B/C showed a sig- nificantly higher EAS than its Pt0.5^Ag-A/C counterpart in both the acidic and alkaline electrolytes, indicating that the Pt in Pt0.5^Ag-B/C has a much higher dispersion than in the un- alloyed Pt0.5^Ag-A/C catalyst. This may be explained by the different chemistry of their Pt precursors during the prepara- tions. When [PtIICl4]2â€“ was the Pt precursor (i.e., Pt0.5^Ag- A/C), the deposition of Pt atoms occurred by a single mecha- nism of citrate reduction of [PtIICl4]2â€“ ions; when [PtIVCl6]2â€“ was the precursor (i.e., Pt0.5^Ag-B/C), however, the deposition of Pt involved two independent mechanisms, one was the galvanic replacement reaction between [PtIVCl6]2â€“ and Ag (i.e., 4Ag + PtCl62â€“ Ä¼ Pt + 4Ag+ + 6Clâ€“), and the other was the reduction of [PtIVCl6]2â€“ by citrate [10,13]. The galvanic replacement reaction, which took full advantage of the colloi- dal Ag surface to disperse metallic Pt, was considered critical for maintaining a higher Pt dispersion and thus higher EAS of Pt in the Pt0.5^Ag-B/C catalyst [10]. This explanation is in line with the fact that the exposed Ag surface was significantly lower in Pt0.5^Ag-B/C than in Pt0.5^Ag-A/C, as indicated by the much weaker redox peaks of Ag for Pt0.5^Ag-B/C (Fig. 1). Figure 2 shows the polarization curves for the ORR of Pt0.5^Ag-A/C, Pt0.5^Ag-B/C, and Pt/C at a rotation speed of 1600 r/min in 0.5 mol/L H2SO4 and 0.5 mol/L KOH. As it would be expected, the kinetic current (ik) increased with de- creasing the potential.

The currents are normalized by the geometric area of the disk electrode (i.e., 0.25 cm2). Scanning rate = 50 mV/s. FENG Yuanyuan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(8): 776â€“779 crease also gradually changed the rate controlling step for ORR from an electron transfer step (i.e., the electrochemical reaction) to a mass transfer step (i.e., oxygen diffusion). Be- cause ik is the current in the absence of any mass transfer ef- fects and E1/2 is a constant independent of the reactant con- centration in a given electrochemical system, the ik values at around E1/2 (0.40 V in the acidic and â€“ 0.20 V in the alkaline electrolytes) were normalized according to the loading and EAS of Pt and then used to compare the activity of Pt in each of the catalysts (Table 1). In both the acidic and alkaline elec- trolytes, the MSA of Pt in Pt0.5^Ag-B/C was significantly higher than that in Pt0.5^Ag-A/C, and the intrinsic activity of Pt in the Pt0.5^Ag-B/C catalyst was much higher than that in the E-TEK Pt/C catalyst. Therefore, the interfacial alloying in Pt^Ag nanostructures was very beneficial for the electrore- duction of oxygen. Distinct electronic interaction between Pt and Ag was detected in Pt0.5^Ag-B/C but not Pt0.5^Ag-A/C by XPS in our earlier work [10,13]. The binding energies of the Pt 4f peaks for Pt0.5^Ag-B/C were clearly higher than those for Pt0.5^Ag-A/C, which indicates an electron transfer from Pt to Ag and thus a development of d band vacancy at Pt of the Pt0.5^Ag-B/C catalyst. The increased d band vacancy at Pt would induce a stronger interaction of the Pt with the lone-pair electrons at the oxygen atoms and then promote the activation of molecular oxygen for its electro-reduction reac- tion, thus making the Pt0.5^Ag-B/C catalyst more active for ORR than its counterpart Pt0.5^Ag-A/C catalyst. The electron transfer and diffusion rates are both important for ORR at intermediate electrode rotation speeds (e.g., 1600 r/min here in this study). However, their relative contributions to the measured overall oxygen-reduction current would de- pend on the overpotential at the cathode and obey the well-known Koutecky-Levich equation [16]: 2/3 1/ 2 1/ 6 k d k 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0.62i i i i nFAD v CZ where i is the measured overall current density, ik is the kinetic component, id is the diffusion component, n is the number of transferred electrons per oxygen molecule, F is the Faraday constant, A is the geometric electrode area, Èž is the kinetic viscosity of the electrolyte solution, È¦ is the angular rotation speed of the electrode, and D0 and C0 are, respectively, the diffusion coefficient and initial concentration of oxygen in the electrolyte. The electrode rotation speed was changed in the range of 200â€“2500 r/min to obtain a series of polarization curves and then Koutecky-Levich equations (not shown here), from which the number of transferred electrons (n) at different potentials were calculated (see the insets of Fig. 2). In the potential region investigated, the n values were between 3.6 and 4.0 for all of the three catalysts (Pt0.5^Ag-A/C, Pt0.5^Ag-B/C, and Pt/C) in the acidic electrolyte and were hardly affected by the potential of the reaction. It is therefore that the mechanism for ORR on the interfacially alloyed cata- lyst could be the same as that on conventional Pt/C catalyst. In contrast, the n values of ORR in the alkaline electrolyte de- creased steadily with decreasing the reaction potential for all of the three catalysts. These observations suggest that the nature of the electrolyte solution would have a subtle effect on the catalysis of Pt for ORR. 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 3.4 3.6 3.8 4.0 4.2 -1.0 -0.8 -0.6 -0.4 -0.2 3.4 3.6 3.8 4.0 -1.0 -0.8 -0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0.0 -0.4 -0.3 -0.2 -0.1 0.0 0.1 (3) (2) i/( m A /Pg -P t) E/(V vs SCE) (b) (1) -0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 -0.4 -0.3 -0.2 -0.1 0.0 0.1 (3) (2)i /(m A /Pg -P t) E/(V vs SCE) (a) (1) (3) (2) (1) E/(V vs SCE) n (2) (1) E/(V vs SCE) n (3) Fig. 2.

Further investigation on the relationship between the composition (atomic Pt/Ag ratio) and cathode activity for ORR of the Pt^Ag/C catalysts would be informative for the design and preparation of highly efficient Pt-saving cathode catalysts.

SHORT COMMUNICATION An Interfacially Alloyed Pt⁁Ag Cathode Catalyst for the Electrochemical Reduction of Oxygen Yuanyuan FENG Junhong MA Guirong ZHANG Dan ZHAO Boqing XU * Innovative Catalysis Program, Key Laboratory of Organic Optoelectronics and Molecular Engineering, Department of Chemistry, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China * Corresponding author. Tel/Fax:(010)62792122 An interfacially alloyed Pt-on-Ag nanostructure (Pt0.5⁁Ag-B, atomic Pt/Ag ratio being 0.5) was loaded on Vulcan XC-72 carbon to make a cathode Pt0.5⁁Ag-B/C catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The electrocatalytic performance of this Pt0.5⁁Ag-B/C catalyst was measured by reference to its unalloyed counterpart Pt0.5⁁Ag-A/C and E-TEK Pt/C catalysts. The intrinsic activity of Pt in the Pt0.5⁁Ag-B/C catalyst was identified to be twice that in the E-TEK Pt/C catalyst although the half-wave potentials (E 1/2) of the ORR curves over both catalysts were the same. Compared with the unalloyed Pt0.5⁁Ag-A/C catalyst, the alloying at the Pt/Ag interface in the Pt0.5⁁Ag-B/C catalyst gave a more positive E 1/2 and also a significantly higher mass-specific activity of Pt for ORR.
