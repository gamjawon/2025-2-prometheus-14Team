School of Materials Science and Engineering Central South University Changsha 410083 PR China Graphical abstract The promotion effect of Fe was demonstrated over the MoP catalyst in HER, leading to a remarkable enhancement of the activity with a smaller Tafel slope of 49mVdec−1 and much larger current density (about 6 times). By the introduction of Fe element, a novel Fe-promoted MoP catalyst was proposed for the first time, which was prepared via a simple temperature-programmed reduction method. Benefitting from the promotion effect of Fe, the HER activity of the MoP catalyst is remarkably enhanced with smaller Tafel slope and much larger current density, which can be attributed to the reduced crystal size and smaller charge transfer resistances. However, it must be noted that the addition content of Fe must be accurately controlled, or the final HER activity will be deteriorated. Keywords Molybdenum phosphide Hydrogen evolution reaction Catalysis Fe Promoter 1 Introduction As a clean and renewable energy source, hydrogen is one of the promising alternatives to carbon-based fuels. And water spitting has attracted a great deal of attention to efficiently produce hydrogen, which requires active and economical catalysts [1]. Although Pt-based catalysts show the best HER activity up to now, their excessive price and lack of abundance limit the wide industrial applications [2]. Possible alternatives to replace Pt-based catalysts are molybdenum-based materials, including molybdenum disulfide [3], [4] and [5], molybdenum boride [6], molybdenum nitride [7], molybdenum carbide [8], [9] and [10], and molybdenum phosphide [11], [12], [13] and [14], etc. Among them, molybdenum phosphide is one of the best candidates to replace Pt because of its low cost, rich reserve, high activity and good stability. In our previous work, we revealed that the MoP catalyst showed better HER activity than the counterpart of Ni2P [11]. And more efforts have been made to further improve the HER activity over MoP-based catalysts. Both Xiao [12] and Xing [13] et al. adopted citric acid (CA) as the surfactant to increase the BET surface area, exposing more active sites, which greatly improved the final HER activity with a small Tafel slope of 54mVdec−1. McEnaney et al. even selected an oil bath method to prepare amorphous MoP nanoparticles, which was only about 4nm in diameter, resulting in more active sites and excellent HER activity with a small Tafel slope of 45mVdec−1 [14]. To reduce the charge transfer resistance, Cui [15] and Jyothirmayee [16] et al. adopted carbon flake and graphite as highly conductive supports, leading to a remarkable enhancement of the HER activity with Tafel slopes of 56.4 and 63mVdec−1, respectively. Despite of great efforts, more work is still strongly required to further improve the HER activity of MoP-based catalysts. Herein, we describe a simple strategy of promotion with the Fe element, which leads to the great improvement of HER activity over the MoP catalyst with a small Tafel slope of 49mVdec−1. More importantly, the current density is also remarkably increased because of the promotion of Fe, which is about 137mAcm−2 at −400mV with a small catalyst loading of 0.071mgcm−2, 6 times larger than that of the pure MoP catalyst. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation Typically, certain amounts of FeCl3·6H2O, (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O and (NH4)2HPO4 with the Fe:Mo:P molar ratio of x:1:1.25 were dissolved into distilled water. The mixture solution was aged in a covered beaker held at 90°C for 12h in a water bath, dried in a furnace at 120°C for 12h, and calcined at 500°C in air for 10h to obtain the solid precursor. Finally, the active Fe-promoted MoP catalysts were obtained via temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) of the precursors by heating to 400°C in 0.5h and then from 400 to 650°C for 2.5h at a heating rate of 1°C/min in a hydrogen atmosphere (300mLmin−1), represented by FeMoP-x. 2.2 Characterizations X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a D/max-2500 system with a Cu Kα radiation (λ=0.154nm). The microstructures were observed using the scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Quanta FEG 250) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 2100) at an accelerating voltage of 200kV with the sample supported on copper grids. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS, Escalab 250Xi) were conducted using a monochromatic Al Kα source and a charge neutralizer. All the analysis of XPS data were referenced to the C 1s peak arising from adventitious carbon (its binding energy was set at 284.8eV). 2.3 Preparation of electrodes and electrochemical measurements In a typical procedure, 1mg of catalyst and 80μL of a 5wt% Nafion solution were dispersed in 1mL of a solution of deionized water and ethanol (4:1 in volume). After the mixture had been stirred by ultrasonication for 30min, 5μL of the catalyst slurry was dropped onto smooth glassy carbon electrodes (GCEs) with a diameter of 3mm and dried at room temperature. The mass loading was about 0.071mgcm−2. The electrochemical measurements were carried out in a standard three-electrode setup at a CHI 660E electrochemical station. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was conducted in 0.5M H2SO4 (purged with pure Ar) at room temperature with a scan rate of 2mVs−1. A saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as the reference and a glassy carbon rod as the counter electrode. All the potentials were calibrated to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Tafel plots are fitting into the Tafel equation (η=b log(j)+a, where j is the current density and b is the Tafel slope), and no corrections for the ohmic drop have been applied. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis (EIS) was conducted from 1MHz to 0.02Hz at −220mV with an amplitude of 5mV. 3 Results and discussions The XRD patterns of the as-obtained samples are shown in Fig. 1 a. It can be seen that all the samples exhibit sharp diffraction peaks, indicating good crystallinity, and match well with the standard MoP phase (JCPDS Card: 89-5110) with typical reflections of (001), (100), (101) and (110). With the introduction of Fe, there are no remarkable changes, which can be observed. However, it must be noted that a small typical peak of FeP at 48.3° can be found with an enlarged figure from 44 to 50° (Fig. 1b), demonstrating the existence of Fe in the form of FeP (JCPDS Card: 71-2262). Moreover, the intensity of the peak at 48.3° is gradually strengthened with the increased addition content of Fe, and another typical peak of FeP at 46.3° becomes observable with higher addition contents of Fe (Fe: Mo=0.12 and 0.14), indicating that the formation of FeP is greatly improved with sharper typical reflection peaks. Moreover, calculated by the Scherrer equation, the smallest average crystal size is about 16nm obtained over the FeMoP-0.10 catalyst, which is much smaller than that of the pure MoP (55nm) [11]. Generally, the crystal size is reduced over all the Fe-promoted MoP catalysts with the addition of Fe, and average crystal sizes of 24 and 23nm are obtained over FeMoP-0.06 and FeMoP-0.08, respectively. However, with higher contents of Fe, the crystal sizes become larger with 34nm and 31nm for FeMoP-0.12 and FeMoP-0.14, respectively, which can be attributed to the aggregation of the excessive Fe element, leading to the further crystal growth. The SEM and TEM images of the FeMoP-0.10 catalyst are shown in Fig. 2 . We can see that the FeMoP-0.10 catalyst is large aggregated clusters composed of small nanoparticles, similar to the morphology and microstructure of pure MoP [11]. The element distribution of Fe, Mo and P was revealed by the SEM-EDX elemental mapping, demonstrating that these elements are well dispersed without remarkable sintered aggregations, as shown in Fig. 2b. To gain a further observation of the microstructures, TEM and HRTEM were also performed, and it can be seen that the FeMoP nanoparticles are about 80nm in size and aggregated to from lager clusters. Furthermore, the typical lattice fringes observed by the HRTEM confirm the existence of MoP and FeP phases, as revealed in Fig. 2d. The lattice distances of 0.28, 0.32 and 0.2nm correspond to the (100), (001) and (101) planes of MoP (JCPDS Card: 89-5110), respectively. And the lattice distances of 0.29, 0.24 and 0.18nm correspond to the (020), (111) and (211) planes of FeP (JCPDS Card: 71-2262), respectively. The existence of Fe in the final products was also verified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). All XPS spectra are aligned by C 1s (284.8eV), and then we can see that the FeMoP-0.10 catalyst is composed of Fe, Mo and P elements, as shown in Fig. 3 a. The Fe 2p3/2 shows one distinct peak at 709.9eV and the Fe 2p1/2 is located at 723.4eV for Fe3+ [17], [18] and [19]. The doublets in the Mo 3d spectrum located at 228.3eV and 231.5eV with a separation of 3.2eV can be attributed to Moδ+ species (0<δ≤4), which are generally related to the molybdenum species in MoP [13] and [18]. Moreover, the Mo 3d peaks at higher binding energies (232.5eV and 235.8eV) demonstrate the existence of a small amount of MoO3 species [13]. The high-resolution P (2p) region peaks at 130.4 and 129.5eV corresponding to P 2p1/2 and P 2p3/2, respectively, show that the predominant P species in the surface of FeMoP-0.10 can be assigned to P bonded to Mo in the form of a phosphide [13], [19] and [20]. This suggests that both the ferrum and molybdenum in FeMoP-0.10 have a positive charge (δ+), while the phosphorus has a negative charge (δ−), implying a transfer of electron density from Fe and Mo to P [13] and [18]. Moreover, the binding energy value of 134.1eV is generally assigned to oxidized P species that arise from surface oxidation due to air contact [13]. The polarization curves of various catalysts are shown in Fig. 4 a. It can be seen that the FeMoP-0.10 shows the best HER activity with a small onset potential among all the MoP-based catalysts excepting the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Because of the addition of Fe, the FeMoP-0.10 catalyst exhibits much larger current density and smaller onset potential than those of pure MoP catalyst. At −400mV, an extremely large current density of 137mAcm−2 is obtained over the FeMoP-0.10 catalyst, about 6 times larger than that of the pure MoP catalyst (20.5mAcm−2).To achieve a current density of 10mAcm−2, only −195mV is required for FeMoP-0.10 but −308mV for pure MoP (with a small catalyst loading of 0.071mgcm−2). Obviously, the introduction of Fe remarkably enhances the HER activity of pure MoP. However, it must be noted that the current density of Fe-promoted MoP catalysts is firstly increased with the increased content of Fe, and achieves the largest value with a Fe: Mo mol ratio of 0.1 over FeMoP-0.10, then drops sharply afterwards, even worse than that of pure MoP. Following the same trend, with the increase of Fe content, the Tafel slopes are reduced firstly and achieve the smallest value of 49mVdec−1 over FeMoP-0.10, and then are increased sharply, as shown in Fig. 4b. As we know, the Tafel slope represents the intrinsic activity of HER catalysts, and smaller Tafel slopes mean faster HER rates with the increased overpotentials. Remarkably, the FeMoP-0.10 catalyst exhibits the smallest Tafel slope, demonstrating the best HER activity among all the MoP-based catalysts. Compared to the pure MoP catalyst (60mVdec−1) [11], the FeMoP-0.12 and FeMoP-0.14 even show larger Tafel slopes of 69 and 72mVdec−1, indicating worse HER activity. It can be concluded that only a suitable content of Fe can ensure the great enhancement of the final HER activity. To get a better understanding of the improvement mechanism of the Fe-promoted MoP catalysts, the impedance measurements were also conducted over all the MoP-based catalysts, and the corresponding Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 4c. For pure MoP, a resistance value of 185Ω is obtained. With the introduction of Fe, the resistance of FeMoP catalysts is gradually reduced, 171Ω for FeMoP-0.06, 138Ω for FeMoP-0.08, and reaches the smallest value of 53Ω for FeMoP-0.10. However, with the further increase of Fe content, the resistances are sharply increased to 635Ω for FeMoP-0.12 and 718Ω for FeMoP-0.14, respectively. Evidently, the change of resistance well matches with that of the HER activity, including the polarization curves and Tafel slopes. Therefore, it can be concluded that the enhancement of HER activity over FeMoP catalysts can be attributed to the reduced crystal size and smaller charge transfer resistances. The former affords more exposed active sites, promoting the mass transport, and the latter accelerates the charge transfer, leading to the final improvement of the HER activity. Stability is another concern for the evaluation of a HER catalyst. Fig. 4d shows the polarization curves before and after 1000 CV cycles at a scan rate of 2mVs−1 in 0.5M H2SO4, suggesting a little loss of current density about 7.3% at −400mV. After 1000 cycles, the required overpotential to afford a current density of −120mAcm−2 is increased about 13mV, indicating a relatively good stability. However, it should be noted that although the current FeMoP catalyst exhibits a relatively good stability, it is still inferior to that of the pure MoP catalyst [11], which should be attributed to the occurrence of some corrosion of FeP [21]. Moreover, the current density fluctuates between 40 and 60mAcm−2 due to the influence of hydrogen bubbles on the surface of the working electrode [19]. 3.1 Conclusions The Fe-promoted MoP catalysts have been successfully synthesized by a simple temperature-programmed reduction method. With the addition of Fe, the HER activity of MoP has been greatly enhanced with a small Tafel slope of 49mVdec−1 due to the reduced crystal size and smaller charge transfer resistances. Moreover, with the increase of Fe content, the HER activity is firstly improved and achieves the best over the FeMoP-0.10 catalyst, then drops sharply afterwards. Further improvements of the Fe-promoted MoP catalysts in the HER can be conducted by adopting highly conductive supports with large surface areas, which is also in progress. We believe that this work not only provides us a low-cost and highly active HER catalyst, but also points out the new direction in designing and developing metal-doped transition metal phosphides for applications in the HER.
